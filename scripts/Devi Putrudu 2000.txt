There bloomed a sacred power which started the destruction. This power gave birth to the planets, asteroids and others in the universe. Among these planets is the Earth. The Earth is almost filled with ocean. Sri Krishna's Dwaraka village was formed. The land after the power's destruction. lt is the witness were Kauravas were abolished and Yadhavas then bloomed. A worthy life was led. A light was being lit where there was no difference between the day and night. This is the Dwaraka region. During a lunar eclipse... There was a tremendous change in the universe. All the planets were disturbed. A power of light was formed for destructing everything. lt was coming for destructing the Earth. lt destructed the Earth badly. Dwaraka region was buried in the ocean 5000 years before. A new Dwaraka is formed in the Gujarat state. The atmosphere is filled with the music of Sri Krishna. Sri Krishna's sound of the chains in the leg is heard through the waves. Archeologist are trying to invade the old Dwaraka region. The old one being buried. A holy religious spot is the Dwaraka. There is something in it, extraordinary. Another destruction. To prevent this destruction a power is being born. Deviputhrudu God's Son. Victory Venkatesh. Soundarya. Anjala Javeri. Suresh. Baby Cherry. Editing Thatha Suresh. Photography S. Gopalreddy.

Karuna sister... Where did sister go? Why didn't she come to the airport. Why didn't you come? By the time l got into the car, the driver went away. l followed the car up to the gate. Where did sister go? After a long time you have come, is you sister more important than us? Whenever l come, my sister will receive me. Why didn't she come? She would have come, if she was here. They have found the ancient Mathura in the ocean at Gujarat. Your sister Meerabai, insisted in going to Mathura. My partner Naidu is a big contractor there. l sent her with their family. When will she return? - You go and relax. l have brought this statue for my sister. lt is very good. l have bought these sarees and bangles for her. Are all these available in America? This letter has came from Dwaraka. Sister has written a letter to you. Respected Grandpa ... l am going to give birth to a child. At this time you all should be with me. The first delivery is a rebirth for any lady. l want to see all of you. l don't know the address and phone number of my sister to convey it. Please come. l am eager to see you. lt is true that Karuna has gone to Dwaraka. There she loved an archeology officer. He is not from our caste. Your parents didn't agree for their marriage. Because she got married they have expelled her from our family. Should we keep quite if she gets married like that? Will you also send me out, if l marry against your wish. How will they do it? You are their own daughter. Being an adopted daughter, they have not cared for her. They were finding a good reason for a long time to get rid of her. With this reason, they have fulfilled their wish. You have no sympathy even if she is going to become a mother. No injustices to her. l love her. l will go and bring her back. Also bring her child and husband. lndia will loose. lndia will win definitely. - What is the bet? Where is my purse... Thief... Close all the doors. What you are thinking? How can it happen in my presence? Check everybody carefully. Don't leave anyone. What? - What? - lt's nothing, look there. What? - Nothing. - What is that you are doing? Go. lt's not him. What's it? What are you doing? - Polishing. You also need it. There is no money in it. A message from Hyderabad that there is a necklace worth 20 lakhs. Mr P'son and his grand daughter are coming in the evening flight. They are coming with the necklace. lt's a very good news. We shouldn't leave this opportunity, we must own that necklace. What? - They are not coming. They are not coming today? My friend. What is it? Grandfather and grand daughter are there. l hope they are the ones. Let us check, are they the particular people. What grandpa? - We have booked a vehicle in the Diamond travels. He must be the driver for it. Why should he show a signal like that. ln Bombay, beggars will show off like this. See how this van driver will show off! From which area are you from? - West Godavari - Ours is East Godavari. We both joined together, we will be covering the whole Godavari district. Where? - Anywhere here or even in the toilet. What is it you are joking? Are you a driver, how can you keep it in a toilet and roam? Are you the driver from Diamond cabs? Why are you in a hurry? - l've a vehicle. Come. l should get my baggage. We will bring our baggage. - Aren't they very valuable. You get ready. Why are you talking with him? l've to steal a van before they come. What a good van have l snatched. What? - ln Bombay snatched means that he has bought it. This van is comfortable for passengers, but dangerous for our enemies. How is it Fedrickson? - Fedrickson! What grandpa? Why is he calling you Fedrikson Victoria. He would have been telling his family names? Which hotel? What hotel? - We have booked it for Dwaraka. Have you put the baggage inside. - What, is he telling Dwaraka? Has he changed his mind. No matter, we are in need of diamonds. Will sister think that l will join hands with you? Why should she think? She knows well about you. All these days l didn't care for her. How will she know that l didn't know about it? l will tell her. You take me to her once. Why are you talking about your sister only. l can understand her greatness by listening to your talks. Look at me, there is no one to take care of me. Your sister is lucky. Carrying valuables is dangerous, l'll put it in the safety locker. We can take care of our safety. You can take care, but there are robbers along the highway. Look straight and drive, accident may occur. How can an accident occur to this vehicle with diamonds. You are being blabbering about diamonds, are you mad of if? ln this van there are diamonds from all over the world. What! Diamonds in this van? Her eyes are American Diamonds. lf she smiles, 32 Nigerian diamonds. lf she gets angry, 2 red China diamonds. She is like a Kohinoor diamond. Will you drive the van silently or shall we get down. How can l leave you. l am tensed looking at this foolish driver. Did you keep the things brought for your sister carefully. lt doesn't matter even if he drives rashly. l have kept it safely in the big box. Why is it going like this? What has happened? - Diamonds have gone in dynamo. lt is... lt is... That the dynamo is weak. The van will start if you both push the van. We will not push. You pass your time there. Please take us there, somehow. Tigers will come and have a good dinner. Don't go to that extent, we will push it till Dwaraka. Come, let's push, driver you go and drive. ln America they will through the van in sea and driver in the jail. That may be America. But in lndia. Why is he going? How can l be with you? What a beautiful cutting l gave. l've stolen the suitcase. Where? She might have kept it there. Where have they kept it? Where did you go leaving us behind? l did go for a test ride. When did you unload the luggage. We unloaded the baggage because it will be easy to push. You told us that robbers are found on this highway. Oh! What a tit for tat. You only told me not to believe anybody. From now your baggage must be in my custody. You are acting too much. Let's go in another vehicle. Why are you angry? Let's be friends hereafter. Even if you ask l will not stop the vehicle. Let us take the baggage. lt seems there is a hotel here. - What? - l am hungry, stop it. Stop the vehicle. l am terribly hungry. Good flavours from the hotel. Shall we finish the dinner. You don't have any work. Do you want me to stop, the food will not be good in this Daba. Why are you worried? You must stop the vehicle, when we say. lf you prefer, join us. Grandpa! Keep an eye on the luggage. He may leave us behind. l have tied the luggage with chains. He can't do anything. l have the key of it. - No problem. What? Can you hide one thing? A very costly one. An important one. There's life in it. She will not accept it. Give it to me. l will have it. This is my life. l'll look after it. You can go. Oh!

What is that lipstick on your cheek? Lipstick! l will tell you what happened yesterday night? Grandpa, yesterday night he kissed on my cheek. How can he kiss his own cheek? There is no logic, only magic. What is this area? Why should We come here? We have wasted two days because of that hour. Where is the diamond? - Diamond! You are a real diamond. ln 4 hours last night we have covered 700Km. What a journey! What? 700Km? - Only 50Km are left to reach Dwaraka. What?! Did l drive 700Kms? How is it possible? You have brought us here, and why are you asking me... How can l?! What has happened? Yesterday's coconut cola effect there was a cyclone in my stomach. Where is the bathroom? - Am l looking like a servant. For what have l come here? What is happening? Get into the vehicle. Get in. What is it? This waterfall is inspiring me too much. - Even me too. We will bath here and then go to our sister's house. What a dress is it? l want to swim, but that driver is disturbing me talking too much. Let's go to the room and then take bath. What is it? What? Especially ladies should take bath, will l deny in doing it. lf they take bath with their diamond, their soul will saffice. You go and take bath till evening. Where are you going? - To help my baby. What has happened to it? - Have postponed it. lf you stop gas is formed, this gas leads to heart attack. Where is the place? - These are the facilities for it. Baby, l will look after her, go and unload. l have got it. Did the fish trouble you a lot. Grandpa, it was as big as a man. Even the fish has developed the craze for gold. The foolish fish has thought that it is an original diamond necklace. lt is a duplicate necklace bought in an exhibition. A Duplicate one? Something bad is happening since we have started. l must show my finishing touch. lsn't it a bad planet, a very horrible planet. Trained in a good school. A graduate of a university, Gajjela Babu Rao. We thieves have sentiments. We are interested only in property. But you smart people bring this dangerous situations. l would have taken the necklace and sent your baggage by courier. But now what has happened? Trouble to your life. Why are you making me a murderer. What is this? A driver changing into a bandit. What is your background? How are you? Let us discuss afterwards. First open the suitcase and give me what l require.

Her name is Sathyavathi, alias Sathya. This is Sathya. Then who are you. Why didn't you tell it to me before itself. Why didn't you tell your name in the airport itself. A thief is following you. You should have told your details to him. Hiding your names, you want a pilgrimage trip to Dwaraka. You should have told me. Got in to the van, drank well, swam and danced well. Who are you to ask? We are not those people. Please leave us. What to leave? Since two days l have wasted a lot. You give me something from your suitcase. l suspected you from the beginning. l have shot ten big robbers like you on the highway. Look, how foolish you are. Do you know that, why l behaved like this. l just trained how to defend the robbers when they attack. l tested you today and you have passed in it. You go and sit. Ladies should hold fruits and adore flowers. They must not have a pistol like this. l can train you people if l have a pistol. Carry on. l don't mind. That lady threatened me with a pistol. l have wasted two days here. Today back to Bombay. lsn't it beautiful. lt is as good as her heart, very beautiful. Why have they sealed the house. How can they do it? Come let us see. They will only question us, we will have to answer. They will not answer because it is not found in that law and order. You've come in search of your people. These people are after the crime. They don't worry, they have to interrogate, close the case and blame someone. All these officers know about Balaram. His capacity, sincerity and his capability. We both worked in the same department. The questions were not cared by the department even when l asked. They will blame on somebody to prove they are clean. What is that you are talking? You must not talk like that. They will stay with me. lf you want any information l will bring them. You are the best friend of them. Don't you know where they are. lf l know will l keep quiet? l have made several enquiries. They are thinking in their view, but no one is thinking about him. Shall we contact the collector or the concerned officer. We must not be in a hurry. We must solve it slowly. This is our guest house. You can stay here comfortably. Lots of hubbub about Balaram and your sister. Don't leave this house in any case. lf any one pressures you, tell them to call me. This is my phone number. What are these temples and bells.

Who are these...? What is this? Who are these...? Camel. l am having knife. l will cut your nose, ears.... They are constructing Ram mandir in Ayodhya. Why are you here? Why are you tickling me? Who are you? - Who are you? Stop it. Stop the vehicle. This vehicle is mine, not yours. Who are you and why did you bring this vehicle here? Sir, why did you bring this vehicle here? l didn't bring your vehicle, your vehicle has brought me here. Who is this fellow? Acting smart, where is he from? From the sky. - What? Telugu! l am from Eluru. - l am from Nellore. We then both are from Nellore. l don't have any belief that they will come back. After seeing your efforts, l believe that they will definitely come back. Who are you? Where are you from? What do you want? You will be perturbed, if l tell. Myself! Who are you? Dwaraka city is being polluted by your rickshaw carts. They have formed a committee to cancel the license. l am the inspector of that committee.

Everything will be finished. l pity on you. Poor fellow. l want to help you. Please help me in getting out of this trouble. There isn't any problem. ln the airport l missed my bag. My cheque book, cash, credit card... everything in the purse is missing. Now how can l go to Delhi and talk about this? lf l don't go, all your licenses will get cancelled. For going to Delhi, l want money. How much do you want? How much are you having? - One minute. You go to Delhi and cancel that report urgently. Stop it. l have seen whirl winds carrying villages, people, trees... ... this is the first time l am seeing money blown away. You have taken all my money. Give me a fist of diamonds so l can get settled. What diamonds? ln this sea there is Krishna's Dwaraka. There are diamonds, pearls, precious stones... Samantakamani is also there. The Samanthakamani will give l want to snatch that one, buy a good vehicle. l want to tour the entire world. That is why l am learning swimming in ponds, pits etc. l am not able to learn swimming properly. What is that you are seeing? Are you perturbed. This ocean is my elder mother. What? Elder mother! There is an old mother on the moon. Likewise, an elder mother in the ocean. Grandmother will drown in bad people and push ashore good people. What mother is this? Why did you do it? Can you perturb good people? From now onwards don't do it again. Don't say anything. She did not lf l don't say like that, she will not listen to me. Are you speaking the truth. lf you trust, it is truth or else lies. Who are you? Myself. l am staying here. Are you alone. Are you afraid staying lonely. l don't have any fear. Ocean mother, tortoise grandfather is with me. The prawn is my uncle and small fish are aunties of mine. This not an ordinary place, Lord Krishna has walked around. The Dwaraka region is sleeping in the ocean. This is Krishna's invaded Dwaraka. Dwaraka is where Sri Krishna walked. A golden chain of the baby. The chain in the legs of the child. Satyabama's crying... Mending... ERukmini Devi's tulasi garden... A melodious song from the flute. The dancing peacock been seen. The shell which Krishna blew. The chakra with which the demon was killed. A series of stories are present. There is lot like this. Listening to your talks, l hope that there is a big story in it. There is no school today. Will you study well. Where is your house? Look there, the place were the ocean and sky join. My house is there. Why have you settled here? Police will punish if we roam here. You are bringing problems to me. l made a mistake. There is nothing... There is nothing in the ocean. Only rocks, ships etc are there. How is he here? Stop, this child told me everything about this place. Which child? - The child is here. lf the police come, they will throw us underground. Someone following us from the day we entered Dwaraka. Someone aiming you after you started interrogating the case. We are worried and they are creating more problems to us. We will return only with your sister and her husband. Someone will help us to find them out. Friend. Come. l'm thinking about you. How did you know that l am here? l will go in search of people who love me. lt's difficult to relate your age with your talks. You are talking like an elder lady. l've grown fast when l was young. What is your name? My parents have not named me. How should l call you? How am l looking to you? - Like a child. Then call me Papa. l heard that you are hungry. l have brought all this to eat. Come and eat. l'm hungry. Eat. lt's fine. l prepared it especially for you. That's why l felt that my mother is feeding me. The birthmark on the forehead is looking good to you. This is not a birthmark. This is the mark by my mother. Did your mother prepare this food? What is your Father?. My Father. You have your food first, dear friend. We will go out and play. Am l your good friend. - Yes. Don't you have a better friend than me. You are the only friend l have. You are telling lies. -lt's true, l don't have anyone. Someone in your mind. You like her very much. She also likes you very much. lf you go to Lord Krishna's temple. You can see her there. Give it to her without hiding be it a gift or your love.

Later l came to know that you are not concerned with it. l robbed one necklace near the water falls. White dress is slipping during the evenings. Asking me to do romance... in the morning. lf the touches in the music are my romantic... hero. Your body is fully filled with music. Love teacher comes here to be in a flower cradle. l will reach the shore with a song. Our fight is permanent and struggle can be shared. lnvitation is very romantic like the sweet music. Rainbow looking for a coat giving the age as a bribe. The girl will ask me some more to have. Asking me to do romance till the morning. You age and youth attracts me. l am the King of your rose garden. Pleasure... What l get is something wonderful. ln future will we have such nights. These flowers and sandal make me feel great. l did not get any information about my sister's family. There is one dog. lf anyone steps in, it ferocious. The lonely house now has a deserted look. We shall do one thing. - What? We will go to that house and see. We may get some clue. Then we can understand, what has happened to them. lt is impossible, they have sealed the house. Security people are not allowing anyone. Security will always hurdle if we got permission. lf we go without permission... Who can go like that? l will go. lt's me you friend, ''Papa''. What friend? Are you surprised to see me. You asked me about my house. This is my house. This is my Father's chair. My mother will cook in this room. ln that room father draws paintings of Dwaraka. My Father has drawn my picture also. You have come in search of Sathya's sister Karuna. She is my Mother... You wanted to know, what has happened? You will not believe it, if l tell you... Come l will show you, my friend... Come l will take you to the stars... Also to the orbit. Come my friend... What is all these? Why did you bring me here? lt is here were many epics and disasters are there. Myths and fights all are here like dolls. World wars are also there. My father's story is also here. Look, he is like an incarnation. My father working on Mathura project in Archeological Department. There were good people like my father, bad people were also there. Since many years, one magician fellow... ... Wanted to grab the supernatural powers which are under the sea... e this reign, he gives human sacrifice of young c. You are not chanting them properly. Now my hard work is going to get the results. l have got the power. The results after thirty years... Start, the sacrifice. How did he get here? Spoiling everything. This is the result of 30 years work. Spoiled it. l'll kill you. Don't think that you are sincere. We are also sincere. What is that, you are sincere. Don't just look here, look around and see what is happening. Who are you to question me? You may be a security officer and l may be from Archeological Department... Providing security is our duty. lf human sacrifices are being done, how can we neglect it. Are you encouraging such things here. You don't know about this department. Minister knows my sincerity. lf this happens again. Why do you get tensed? l can understand your feeling, but how can he... Archeological Department should be blamed. - Why? They have given the responsibility of God. But you are atheist. l don't know whether you believe in God. My duty is important. Why is the yellow cloth flying? The yellow cloth flew from here. l have been observing this many days. Who is performing this? He will not do it openly. There is something fishy. Who are you ? She is from our Region... - ''Hyderabad''. You keep quite. No one should come here. You must be knowing it. This is the place were ''Lord Krishna'' walked. Anyone can come here. - You must not come like this. - Why? You first remove your shoes. - What? You can shout at me afterwards. First remove your shoes. You also do it. - Yes. Look here... Don't say that no one should come here. Tell them to maintain sanctity. Don't think that you are excavating Dwaraka City. lt is your fortune to look at it. All these machinery are not required. You brake a coconut, lit a camphor and offer butter to Lord Krishna. He will bring the Dwaraka here. lf we do this our department need not spend any money on this project. You should not come here. Go... l don't understand, why he shouts... l need two days Leave. When Striky sees you, it is greeting you with a laugh. l am your friend, it is neither greeting me nor barking at me. lt is only because of jealousy. A friend or dog is the symbol of faithfulness. Today is a no moon day. We will have Bermuda triangle, cyclones, volcanoes etc. We should not try to stop them. lf one thinks like that, would a man have gone to the space. ln that underwater, because of it, the calamity occurs. We should know that. l know that. Lord Krishna's ''Vishnu Chakra'' is there. Without the devotion on God if you are disturbing the sanctity. Lord Krishna got angry and is creating calamity like this.

Why you have come again? l came here to explain about these items. Do you know how we got independence because of this Sweet... He could not understand, how this sweet was kept inside... We though that it was because of Gandhiji. A cook offered this sweet to a Britsh man. He thought that the cook was very clever to make this sweet. He thought that lndian's were clever and may hide him, like the sweet. Thinking that he declared lndependence to our country. That is why it was sweet... lndependence. Eat slowly. lt seems you have excavated the temple where Rukmani worshiped... lt's that no one will permit to see this temple. l am around you because l want to see the temple. lf you show it to me. l will see and go to my place. lt seems you are going there at 6 o'clock.

You should be careful. ln the morning, l heard someone calling me... Stop... l am thinking about that voice. The same voice warned me about this fire. Who is that? - A baby. Who's Baby is it? - Our Baby. l can hear voice l am able to hear the voice of my baby. lf you think about the baby in the womb... Whatever noise you hear, you will feel it like that.

Minister is telling the same thing as what l told you. lncase if you fail in the mission. Aeroplane invented to fly, if they fear, how'll they invent it. We could not have reached this place so fast. lt will be great, if we find some valuable energy sources. ... lncase if this project fails. Come on. Speak. What responsibility? lt can be uranium, it will be some atomic energy. lf we find it out, it will be useful to the country. Kindly listen to me sir. l cannot provide all these immediately. We've to discuss in the Cabinet meeting, Finance Minister and Prime Minister. Till such time don't take any decisions. Madam. Greeting, Swamiji. lt's only the fate that's preventing your husband's research. l don't understand. You will understand only when your husband achieves it. When he brings out that Mahashakthi Goddess ''POwER''. You will see the Universal Disaster in your dream. Don't panic, You send it back to the same place. This is the turmeric used by Rukmini to worship Dwaraka Kali Goddess. When situation is going out of hands, it will come to your rescue. lt will help you, take it. Karuna.... Where are the files? ln your room. Karuna... have you taken the tablets... Yes... Have you taken the juice. - Yes. Why are you answering me from inside? l am in the kitchen. Why are you answering me sitting here? That is... - What? Our baby has answered. l told you the other day but you didn't believe me. The Baby is speaking. That was a different voice. Baby voice is very sweet. At least for her sake, You have heard only her voice but l have seen her. You have seen her. How is she? Beautiful...? She is very cute. l will show her. A mark on her face. - Leave this. l will draw it again. No. You may not draw. Let the scar be there. This was the tear of her mother. Even the scar is beautiful to the baby, like a moon. Oh moon in the sky. Come here, as our baby... This fun welcomes the happiness... My love is the reflection in your house. l will give you the ring and show it to all. With the waves l will make a dress to it. l will keep my daughter on a white elephant. l will bring many birds for you... This rainbow and needle are together.

Our Govt. Will save Rs.25,000... his salary every month. Our department will not have a proud fellow like him. How will he come? This turmeric was used by Goddess Rukmimi who worshipped Kali. This will save when your situation goes out of your hand. lt's funny. Even a fisherman can bring this in his boat. He gave a plan to buy equipment costing crores to get this. He demanded a lot and. You acted too smart for getting this. The whirlpool is formed because of its vibration. lt is enough, if you think like that. We must trust it. How must we open it? There's nothing to open it. lt's like a dust bin. lf we kick it, it will break into pieces. The satellite readings say that the power is equalant to 2000 crores of Suns. l didn't tell you, about me. l didn't ask your bio-data. l didn't tell you that matter. We camped in lndia to take that ''power'' from the sea. Your husband alone has taken out the power box, computer also couldn't. Why have you come? You wait. l'll speak. Who are you? Why are you here? Wait... please... l want the power box which he has taken from the sea. There is a huge demand l will offer you more. You can demand any amount. You have to handover the powerbox tonight. Being an ordinary Officer in Archeological Department. l have powerful Guns than yours. What is the chance. Many groups are having. This will not stop. This incident might be repeated by others. lf you say ''No'', they will go to the superiors for help. They look like a powerfull lnternational Mafia gang. They might take out the box kept underground. Let us leave them. You want to drop the box in the sea. Yes... lmmediately. lt must not be delayed. You have fought with the Government and our Archeological Dept. for this box. Why do you want it to be put back into the sea? Are you trying to show. Not about me. After l... l have presumed so many things about it. No. lt is a ''Super Natural Power''. Did you have a dream. - l have seen it with my own eyes. lt is a great thing to see. Kindly believe me. We shall keep it in its original place. lf we don't do that... ...everything will be destroyed in a calamity. Calamity. - Yes. After Dwaraka being buried in the ocean. Knowing that there would be a calamity from the ocean. The power of which is the heart of the sea. To prevent the destruction of the universe. The Ammoru Shakthi were Sri Krishna preys in safe guarding the same. The power which is obstructing the Calamity. lt will become furious every no moon day. That's the reason for... At that time, the birds of Lord Krishna will cool the power of the Goddess. Without knowing that, lf we don't put it back... ...by the next new moon day the entire Earth will be destroyed. Everything will be blank. l will be responsible for all that. lt must not happen. Give permission to retain it and help me out. Experts are coming from Delhi to confirm whether there is a ''power'' in that box. They will decide. Sir, please listen to me. lf we don't take the decision quickly, You never used to believe God, now what is all these. What has happened to you? l didn't beleive. After seeing it, l am able to see the Goddess. A furious power, to destroy. That calamity is coming. Volcano has erupted, Ocean is rising and the universe is sinking. The sea with high tides, the universe is sinking. lt doesn't matter if anything happens to us, but we must save our child. There's nothing happened. Everything is peacefull and normal. That swamiji told us that God will tell us what is going to happen soon. lf that power box is still on Earth it'll lead to heavy destruction. lt will be the total end. We should not be the. You replace the power box. Place it in the same place or else the universe will be destroyed. Why are you calling me? How are you there in our house? You must be in your house with the power box. You cannot blackmail me. lf you don't come immediately you will not even get the dead body of your wife. l'll not leave you. Do you want your wife? l don't care if you... Where is Karuna? Karuna called me that somebody had come. They were torchuring her to know about you. When l retort, they shot one and took Karuna. They asked us to come within half an hour, otherwise they will shoot Karuna. Who are they? Where are they? l will tell you. They said that we should not tell others. l have come here for my wife. We have brought your wife... ... to make you to come here and know where the box is. l came here not to surrender to you. l came to tell you that l don't care for anything. You don't care for your wife's death? What is that you are thinking? Are you going to shoot him. He is the only man lf you kill him, how will we know about the secret? We have not called him to kill. We must know where he has kept the box. l didn't think like that. My dog Striker is very intelligent. l'm seeing your orginality now, my dog did know you long before. l told you before that... Did you listen to me? They are going a to make an atomic weapon with the power of the ''power box''. lt is not an atomic weapon. lt is a great power, you cannot understand even if l explain. Whatever it is. You tell me where did you put it? He will tell me. Daddy... Daddy... l am thirsty... thirsty. He will not stop unless you shoot her. Karuna, please listen. l could not replace. As you were in danger l dropped it in the Kalindi caves in a hurry. Karuna, you will have to replace it. Daddy... Daddy. l am not a human being, as you are. l am an air with a small wish... ... formed from the remenents of the five elements. My sould created by Lord Brahma has come to an end. l became a shapeless soul, are you afraid of me. No Papa. What has happened? That day my father was dropped in the valley. You know that secret. When We did see... Mummy... Mummy... Anyhow we have to know the facts from her today. Not only Gods are there in our country, even demons are present. This is also something like that. A demon can destroy a devil. A little soul guarding. l will mesmerise her. That is why l was not... Because of the devil's line, l could not cross it. We will have to replace that ''power box'' in to the sea. We have to stop the destruction. For that l need a man. That is why l have selected you my friend. You don't know about your birth. When all the nine planets were in one line... ...a very auspicious time... ...when a great power... ...a poor lady gave birth to you in a temple and died. That is ''Brahmi Muhurtham''. He is an orphan. You were blessed by the sacred God mother and became the ''God's son''. That is why you can see me even though l am a bodyless soul. Destiny has made in such a way where you have the resemblance of my father. That is why l was known to you by referring the drawing of my father. Grandpa told us that the power box will be replaced by Mother's hand. lt is the verdict of God. My mother should be saved. Stop this disaster. You show me to my mother like the ''God's son''. You can do it my friend. l will show you definitely. Do you want your life? Tell me where it is. l am dieing, asking you this. Come lady. Oh! Come like a doll. Come with a dancing troop. You can dance by doing magic with music followed by the rythum and tune. Shall l change you and create another. Shall l hold the time and change your destiny. l can make you laugh and make you mad. l will come as a thunder and stop the destruction. My character is a golden one. My victory raises the country's prestige. l can solve any mystery. You will not have any histroy. Bye. Take out your hearts, settle the scores to enjoy with friends. l will sacrifice my life. l will come slowly and aim a thing by throwing an arrow. l can also defeat the King of planets. l have only victory in my hand. l am a dear friend of the Lord's son wishing you all. No. No. lt is very difficult. l have to go to Dubai. Stop, why are you in anxiety. What, do you know Telugu? - Yes. You don't know about them. They are not ordinary people. They are very great. l can understand that they are that type of people. Yes. Tell me, what is the matter? There was a person named Balaram. He is exactly like you. That is why these people are chasing me. Now l understand. Before dieing he revealed a secret about a valuble box to his wife. You do resemble Balaram. You act like Balaram and gather the information of the box. No. No. l don't like this type of drama. - l'll give you 1 crore. Not interested. - 5 crores. That means l have to pretend like her husband. lf l get the information and reveal it to you. You'll give me 5 crores. l will bring the box. We will have to start immediately. Only few hours remaining for the total destruction. Where? l told you. You just can't fool me. l know that all this is their game. They have sent you to make me believe and get the information. l have come here to save you and not to cheat you. l became inevitable to act because l have to make them beleive. l am your man. You sister told me everything. Look at this letter which you wrote it to your grandfather. We will have to start immediately. Within hours the Earth is going to be destructed. We have to stop it. We have to replace it from where the power box is brought. This is the wish of your baby. ls my daughter still alive. Yes, to save her mother and to erase all the allegation of her father. She's struggling as a shapeless soul, supposed to be a playful child. We will have to go immediately. There is no time. There is some power stopping us. Hey you, look at it. Kill him.
