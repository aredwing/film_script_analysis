Make sure you keep away the press there, it's a mess in there. Charlie, good to see you. Miles. Gallo. Why did you not asked for backup? We had no time, Captain. My informant reached me shortly before but by the time Gallo and I were here it was already loose. Is that right, Gallo? - Yes, sir. David, come here. Yes. - What happened in the stairwell? Captain? - That boy, what happened? Listen, Gallo chased him and The suspect walked into the hall and fired twice at him. Mike, grabbed his gun and shot him. That boy has shot twice? - Yes. And Gallo has ?? s time shot? - Yes that's right. And that boy has shot first? Captain ... Are you sure? - That's what I've seen, sir. Gallo, I'm sorry it's hard. How are you? It will be fine. So the boy drew his weapon while you chased him. - Yes, sir. And he shot twice? - Yes. How many times have you shot? - E once. Are you sure? - Yes, sir. And boy shot first? - Sure. Are you sure? Well, we go back inside and go after all now it all is still fresh, ok ?? Lewis. I've been waiting for you. How is he? - Good. Your "he" could be a "she." I shot a guy today. Gallo, I know you're upset. Ok ?, but you just did your job. He can not have been older than 15 years. He stood in the hall and I thought he was someone else. Half the people do not know what we experience every day. Yes, a wild night for me. That you had to be there lying on the ground bleeding to death, ok ?? I saw him breathe his last breath. Listen to me. I do not care the pieces what you think, or did not. They'll nail you to the cross. I shot. He came to me recently and had a girl and said, "I like her very much and wants her to the ball and I want maybe buy her flowers. ' And then I thought: 'How sweet. ' "With what money?" I told him to look for work. - Yes? You have a phone call. Maybe my trip to Hawaii? Hi, Karen. Where is he? I'm really sorry, Karen. You do not want to see him so. Ramon, honey. Let it go. That's not, honey. - Leave it to go. No. - It's the office. Call them back. So, when? Jesus. Who's the agent in charge? No, I'm about an hour in the office. What was that about? - Your husband. God. Captain. - Good morning, Aaron. Good morning, thank you for coming. - With pleasure. We have a problem case, Daniel A 15 year old boy slain in a shoot-out with your agents. It was a justified act, Aaron. - You call it justified? An official investigation is started. - Of course, that's procedure. I'll talk to Mattis. - Mattis, intoxicated with a bow around it. Why? - Because I have someone else design. Jessica Dawson. - I do not know her. She's new. She just comes from detective and Office East. Apparently there are not her and arrested her partner because he is a handcuffed suspect half-dead hit last year. Is that a problem? - No, we have heard a lot of that case. Note Daniel, is there something wrong with this case. We have just not found it yet. I'm not worried Aaron. Mike Gallo has followed the procedures. And he's a good cop. - They are all good policemen until they are no more. - The guy pulled a gun and shot first. To all appearances. - Aaron, there is a witness who confirmed. Detective Miles? - Yes. Not credible. - What do you mean? A long list of misdemeanors. He is a projectile and in my opinion he does not belong to the police. - Fortunately, I did not board my desk according to your opinions, Aaron. He is one of my most effective people and he is a decorated officer. - They shot a little kid down in the middle of an apartment complex, Daniel. - They shot an intruder down who shot at the police. Maybe you are right. But that does not change the fact that an white cop killed a black boy without the slightest warning. The press will have a beautiful day with this, I must remind you that? I sit on a winnable place here. it is clear to me. When all hell breaks loose and I promise you that it will happen I'm not the one going to fool. Count your once good at this. I would find annoying when you are sucked. With respect, in connection your upcoming retirement. How long do you have, six months? - Yes. What do you say, Aaron? - I'll tell you how things stand. Ok ?, there is anything else? That's all for now. Ok ?. Thank you, Captain. - Thank you. Let the Morel files bring inside, please. Bianca. Ms. Rivera? I'm Agent Jones. - May I now take my son? Madam, Ramon was found with a gun in his possession when he died. Therefore fired the agent. What? What are you talking about, that is not possible. Ma'am, I understand that this is not easy. But I can assure you that very capable people working on this. Very capable? As the one who fired at ... I want my son. A good student, no notes, no contacts with gangs No suspension from school and shoot from close to an agent in the middle of the night. Do you think that's strange, detective? I do not have enough facts to an opinion about having this matter, sir. Why do I ask a novice detective without any experience in internal affairs of to conduct this research? Sir, I can not answer. You testified against your partner, right? - Yes, sir. He was found not guilty if I remember correctly. You were however transferred with administrative tasks. You are a muggenzifter, a danger to anyone. There is no executive who you ever give a promotion. Why they chose you? Because internal affairs is everything you have left. So they just shot him down? - Yes. Why? - I do not know why. That boy was just standing there and the cop shot him just down. How often do I have to have to explain? Does he know you've seen him? - I do not know. Perhaps, yes. - Then they'll find you. Do you think I know that? - My God, Jacob We have to leave here. - And where can we go? I do not know. I have a cousin in Virginia, maybe we can go to her, Virginia? What are we doing in Virginia? Minimum wage, work, The ends meet. No, we do not. - Look how we live now. You said that the last transaction would be, and then no more. You promised. - It does not all go as planned, right? Let's forget it and just leave. - We have no money, Angela. No food, no money for the rent, nothing. - Find a job. Stop whining. Jesus, I rule it. Mom? - It's all right, darling, Mommy and Daddy are just talking, ok ?? Hey, big guy. Did we scare you? Sorry. Listen, I'll take this, okay ?? So let me handle it. What we do is not bad, ok ?? I'll take you back to bed, okay ?? How are you? - Pressure. Yeah, I know. You're always busy. What do you want, David? Listen, I was hoping I could see you tomorrow even. I do not think so. The only thing I ask is if you want to have lunch with me. Yet you still know we're divorced, right? Yes, I do know, but I ... I just missed you. Please, do not. I had a very difficult arrest this morning. A boy was slain. - Yes, I heard. Look where I am. I feel a bit alone here and you're the only friend I have. Have you signed the papers? David? What are they ... Yes. David. - I'll take them. Well, eating lunch. Goodbye, David. Listen, I ... Bam, asshole. Jacob, where have you been all this time? I stayed out of sight. It was disturbed when. I can not believe you are there out alive. Just on. Those cops were shooting inside. Do you know what happened to that guy? - What guy? Emerging from the news, they have slain. Yeah, I heard that he was on the police has shot. Disturbed Mexican. - That damn Mexicans. No, that boy has done nothing. That cop shot him in cold blood. Did you see that? - It was really weird. Listen man, I think we are momentarily not have to see. I can not use that kind of attention so come here but no more. Yes that is good. Maybe I'm out of town. I am fed up. Once I get my money I'm out. - What? Your money? - Yes man. My part. - There is no part. That deal backfired. - I know you took all that money. So just give me my share and then I'm gone. What're you talking about? What are you talking about, man? You're lucky to be alive. And how do I know it was not the informant who betrayed us to the police? Get the col? Re with your bullshit. - I col get re? Yes, I am not a traitor. - The money Samuel, I have earned it. Turn it over. You store not as a tone with me. Give me your fucking arm. You know what we do to traitors? Detective Dawson? Captain Richards wants you like speaking in his office. Come on in. Captain. - Yes? I'm Detective Dawson internal affairs. You wanted to see me? Yes, please sit down. Thank you. I understand that you are new. - I'm new to this office, yes. And new to internal affairs. - Yes. Would you like some coffee? - No, thank you, sir. I do not know what you expect But I want you to know that at this office Internal affairs is not a separate department. It is not us against. - I understand that. I know you have to do your job, I must also. I want as little a rampage officer in my department than you. I just want you to remember that we are here all professional police men and women too, of course. We do our best to the community protect and serve. We are not the bad guys, ok ?? Of course. - Ok ?. So you've got the Gallo case? - Yes. How's it going so far? - I did not have all the facts, sir. You've surely got the reports? - I've got them. Do agent Gallo, administrative service now? - Yes, until further notice. So you do not suspend him? - No. That depends on your research. I want to question him. - Of course. And the other officer, Detective Miles. - Yeah, are available. Thank you. - And I also hope to be able to contribute. Thank you, sir. Do you have any questions? They will still come. That's all over. - Thank you, sir. Ms. Dawson? Unofficially. Hope you do not mind me saying I did not expect such a young person. Thank you for coming. is that for me? - It's probably cold. I know I am what I leave. I ... I had a bad morning. - You have chosen the time, David. And you instead. - This was close to both of us. Only close to you, Rebecca. Have you any idea where I stay? You get the house back soon. I almost moved my stuff. I told you I do not want the house. You can stay as long as you want. I am OK ?. I move in with a friend. A friend? I get it, yes. You're such an asshole. I do not know why I still energy in stop. I'm happy for you, Rebecca. No, I really, I ... The single life also goes well with me. I have all kinds of options. If you are married also stopped. - You left me. I'm not talking to you. Did you bring the papers? Damn, the papers. I forget them, I ... Why make this harder? Because I still love you. Rebecca, look at me. And tell me that you Do not think of me. I have a meeting, I should go. - Jesus Christ, we just got here. No, you're right. I'm a half hour there, remember? Sign the papers and bring them along home. - Rebecca, listen. Hey guys. Where are you going? - I wanted to bring some stuff back home. Why do you not come back? This is only a temporary situation, it is just as long as the investigation lasts. It will be fine. - Why would not they be? Gives you nothing in your head, man. We do hard work and sometimes things like this happen. Yes, you are right. - Detective Dawson is an honest cop. Just tell your side of the story. That's all you need to do. Ok ?? - Yes, sir. Leave your things here, they are safe, come on. Look at that. That's a boy, you hear that? That's your baby's heartbeat. A healthy boy, congratulations. Do you remember that night? - Yes . I want you to remember that this is part of a criminal investigation. Do you understand. - I understand that. I want to ensure that you do not get a lawyer requested, is that correct? Do I need one? - Answer the question detective. Yes ma'am, that's right. Detective, not answering my questions or antagonizing any aspect This investigation or interrogation, lead to criminal prosecution. Are you new? Everyone asks me that, does it matter? Do you mind that I smoke? - Yes, it is a non-smoking building. And get your gun off the table, please. I have some questions for you. Who autoriseerde this operation? - I did. Do you permission first someone had from the office? No time. I got a tip and I have there action taken. There is recovered any money, right? That was in my report, yes. - I have read it. What time did you get at the place of the event? Just after nightfall, the transaction would occur around 20:00. And your mission? - We are waiting just outside the building and Miles had the information. How long were you with the investigation this operation involved? This group popped up a year ago and we followed them for three months. Who gave you the details of the deal? - I've never had that information. You know how many suspects were involved? I've heard nothing about. You knew one of the suspects Before playing this matter? No. - But you identified Ramon Rivera as one of the drug dealers. - You ever worked himself into the field, detective? Yes I have. - Is there ever shot you? That someone wanted to kill you? - That's irrelevant. You know nothing of it, why your question perhaps those stupid questions. Tell me about Ramon Rivera. - I know nothing about him. What happened is terrible. but happened so many around me and there was so much shot at me ... - You made a mistake? No, I defended myself. He shot at you first? - Yes. Yes. - Yes, he shot first. E? N times, twice? - I saw two shots, I heard two. I've fucking heard two shots. - Heard or seen? He shot me, ?? n times, twice. He had a gun and shot me. And you shot back? - Yes. So you're saying that those 15 years old boy without criminal was involved in this giant drug deal? Cincinatti Ohio, writes a 15-year-old boy a book report on Huckleberry Finn. The teacher gives him a six min. The next day he comes to school with the weapon from his father and kills his teacher and eighteen others. Then stop that little bastard in the arm his mouth and pulls the trigger. There is daily violence, detective. So tell me no nonsense story a great kid which not hurt a fly. Because I do not care of it. You were involved in yet so a shooting, right? I am involved in a lot of shootings, Yes. An unarmed car driver? You cut him? I am acquitted. Not exactly. The case was settled with the family of the boy and you got disciplinary leave. Did you bother to temper yourself To maintain control, detective? What do you think? Is that why your wife has had to impose a restraining order? And you're not even in a second parting with your second wife? I do not think it's relevant. Not? That's all for today. This is for when you might something forgotten. I forget nothing. An awkward, right? - I've seen worse. All that nonsense about my personal history. Cheap bullshit. Has she said anything that was not true? Do you do that? Do you want to ask me something, Captain? - I asked you one direct question, David. Have not you said something inside that is not true? Do not tell me you believe that nonsense. - What I believe is that there is a very clear line to us apart from the bad guys. They call it honor. Your father believed there too, until the end. I have taken his place when you graduated from the academy. And I supported you, even if no otherwise this office did. So I ask you now, man to man, your honor. Plays more in this case then you tell me? I can not even believe you ask me. You should go to the police, Jacob. They should listen to you. - I can not do. I have just this sort. No. No, I can not do this anymore. I just need ... I just need a few days. Yes, you said a few days ago. There is nothing better. We do not have enough food in the fridge. I can arrange this. Trust me. - You trust? What happens the day that you do not come home? What should I tell Adam? I'm going away, Jacob. With or without you. I let my son not grow up in this mess. Angela ... Angela. No that is not necessary. - Stay away from me. Or what? Are you going to shoot me? I'm not armed. - What do you want? Think you're better than me? Interrogate me like I'm the bad guy? You ask me about my temperament. Let me tell you what makes me angry. Bureaucrats like you have no idea what is needed to survive on the streets. Why do you think the hell you're safe at night? And we need that bullshit agents as you swallow. Once you get into the real world then break you. What kind of cop now throws his partner off the bus? A man with a wife and a child. And Do you take him on because he does his job. You must be very lonely so if you're a bitch, is not it? Maybe that's it. Maybe you're lonely. Maybe I can help you with that. Backward. Backward, detective. You got me. Have a nice evening. What kind of cop now throws his partner out of the bus? A man with a wife a child ... Rodriguez, he's under control. Stop, Trevor. Fuck Dawson, watch your suspect. Agent Rodriguez, put the gun down. I'm your partner. Drop it, now. Thank you. What is going on? This is Detective Dawson. She wants talk to you about this case. I do not think so. What are you doing here? I questioned the tenants of the building. Ramon came there often to visit his friend Viktor. That night also. I talked to Victor and Ramon never had a weapon with him. I have nothing to say. - Michael. Penny, stay out here. I want you to leave. You protect your partner? - I've already given my statement. I've looked at your file. Michael. You're not like Miles. If it was an accident, I can help you. Ramon did not shoot you that day, is not it? He did not even have a weapon. The truth eventually comes up anyway. Goodbye, detective. A life lost in this community life is too much. That's why I will be the full force my desk ... And I promise you will look differently ... Because life does matter ... The life of Ramon matter. Ms. Rivera, sorry very much for your loss. I can not even imagine how difficult this must be for you. But agent Mike Gallo, has a clean record. No previous shootings. - He's lying. And he had someone who could vouch for him. They lie both. Ms. Rivera. - You all lie. Ms. Rivera, you know that your son drugs? The autopsy report shows traces of marijuana in his blood when he died. Have you never had warning signs? Mrs. Rivera wants to think that their children involved in something like this. But with this evidence, there is nothing we can do. Marijuana? You do not shoot someone down because he used marijuana. Shall we make a party of it, dear? Come here. Come here. Wanted you so badly, does not this? But calm, quiet. Take it. Keep your damn head. Asshole. Sorry. - Damn. Shut the fuck shut your head there. Get out you, damn it out. Sammy. Did you hide me? Did you not think I'd find? No, I do not hide myself for you. I had to just get quietly keep in a safe place. And this is a safe place? - Yeah, no one gives me something here. Except you. Where is my money, damn it? Under the bed. - Yes. Of course. You had it pretty fucked up. We could have been dead. I told you to come alone. Yes fixed, you and your damn trigger certain friends? Did you say that too at your partner? he killed a boy. Why? You think I did not know you think it stopped? You better pay attention, man. Do you walk to threaten me? - I'm just, I'm just saying. What did you say? - I did not say anything. Who did you tell. - I have not told anyone. What the hell do you know? - I know nothing, it is Jacob. He tells everyone in town that you an unarmed boy gunned down. Well? I have nothing ... - Have not you seen him? When you said that, I have nothing said about it. Who the hell is Jacob? - It's nothing, man. I gave him only brought because you said you were going to arrest anyone, ok ?? And it's not my fault you guys they have run. Listen to me. Look at me. Ok ?, come on, okay? Why would I say something. With everything that I already know about you? - You fucking ... Damn. Get the col? Re, man. What was that, damn it? Who is this guy? - I do not know. Where is he? - I saw him recently beaten up. Ok ?? No one has seen him since then. Damn. Ok ?, this is what we do. You think that guy and makes he keeps his mouth. We have not agreed. - Find him, then you get the rest. Look, this is bullshit. I'm not going ... - Find him. What are we going to do now? The only thing we can do, Mike. If he has no one told he also does not do, okay ?? He will probably disappear. - Are you kidding me? He talks all. How do you think I found out? Do you want to take that risk, Mike? Because I certainly do not want. We need to find that guy and care that he no further talks. Are you okay? Richards, has suspended me. Yes, I heard. How deep is the investigation? As deep as needed, Mike. Mom? I made you breakfast. I need three people for dry walls. - Yes, here. Wait. Does someone here speak English? You, you and you. Gringo, you go with? It does work though.
