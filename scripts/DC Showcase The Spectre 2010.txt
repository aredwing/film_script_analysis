But those lights cast dark shadows. Shadows that hide even darker secrets. My name is Corrigan, I'm a cop. And I have a few secrets of my own. No, I didn't see anyone suspicious. Stay in the area now, we have sealed the crime scene. Yes sir, no sign of explosives. We're running a trace of the residues. You weren't assigned to this case, Corrigan. What gives? Don't worry Brice, I won't take credit. Got a call from a friend. Jim! Thank God you're here. They killed my father, Jim. - They killed him. - We'll find out who did this. Can you think of anyone who would want your father dead? Dad had as many enemies as he did fans. Everybody was jealous of him. - Did you see anything... - Flemming. I've been in Mr. Brenner's employ for over 20 years. - You didn't answer my question. - See anything? Besides the terrible aftermath, no. I believe the security camera caught something. Brenner have any enemies? As many as any successful man. Any reason altercations come to mind? There were set long-time collaborators that Mr. Brenner... ...did not use on his latest film. They were quite upset. I'm gonna need some names. Who is there? I said who's there?! Didn't expect to see me again, did you, Flynn? You're dead. - We killed... - Killed me? All because you got cut out of a job. That was worth my life? Who are you?! I am vengeance. I am The Spectre. This is impossible! In the land beyond the living, all things are possible. No! Please! Corrigan! Get you ass in here! Just what do you think you're doing, Corrigan? Working a case, Captain. You know, my job. The Brenner murder isn't your case... just because you had a thing with his daughter. It's Detective Brice's. How about you looking to whoever's knocking-off our suspects? Come again? One of Hollywood's top special effects guys... was found squashed like a freakin' bug this morning. And he was on Brice's suspect list. I'll look into it. And then you should tell Brice to work faster. - Peter McCoy. - What the hell?! Only a guilty man flees, Peter McCoy. Get away from me! As you wish. But you will never escape your fate. No! Jim. - I'm so glad you came. - What's going on, Amy? Just this. We always had something, didn't we? Once upon a time, maybe. Run away with me, Jim. We through anywhere. Be together. like this, forever. You're good kid. Your daddy shoulda let you star in his movies. - What do you mean? - You're not going anywhere, baby. Your father's death was an inside job. Wasn't just a lucky guess when the killers punched in the... security code, you gave it to 'em. The real connection is the money. All them bills. Should be easy to trace under your account. Jim, I'm rich now. You'll love me. We can be together. No dice. I coulda given you the world. I left this world a long time ago. You can't kill a dead man. The guilty must be punished for their crimes. Sometimes... there isn't a hell of a lot of satisfaction in my job. It's hard watching talented, beautiful people... throw their lives away for nothing. But this is a town where fame and fortune... too easily bring out the worst in people. When that happens, I'm here to avenge. As my secret... I am The Spectre.
