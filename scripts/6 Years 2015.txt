How's it going, man? - Good. - Good, good. - How are you? - Great, great. - Young Daniel. - How are you, sir? - Good, man. How you doing? - Good, good. Whoo! Whoops! Is it all gone? You are drunk. I got a full cup now. Mnh. Can you give me a ride home? I didn't drive here. I'm going to Dan's now. That's okay, you can just drop me off on the way. No, you're not on the way to Dan's. You're on the way to my place. Yes, I am. Please. I mean, it would be so much easier if I just lived with Dan. Okay, well, fuck you. You're giving me a ride home because there's no one else at this party. So serious. Will you listen to me! I'm trying to have a serious conversation. You never listen to me. - Oh, really? - I'm gonna marry Dan and have his babies by the time I'm 26. Oh, yeah? Well, does Dan know about this marriage? Do you know - Do you know how long we've been together? - How long? - Are you ready? Boom. Six fuckin' years. Shit! I know! Mnh. Mnh. Oh, God. Oh! Oh, I missed you. Mm-hmm. Are you trying to take advantage of me? Yeah. Okay. Shut up and kiss me. Mmm. - Drunk, drunk. - Shut - I'm not drunk. How much did you drink? I didn't drink anything. That's a bold-faced lie. "Bold-faced"? Bold. Tell me about your night. Well, mmm... You left me, so I hung out with Jessica and she was making out with this guy. That's very nice. Yeah, and then... The party was shit. Everyone left. It was dying. It was boring, so Jess asked for a ride home, - I gave her a ride home - - You drove? And then, I came to see you. You drove here? Yeah, it's fine. What the fuck, Mel? Don't do that shit. Shh! It's okay. It's so stupid. It's not okay. I wasn't - I'm not even that drunk, Dan. - You're really drunk. - I'm not really drunk. Just promise me, next time, you will call me if you're fucking drunk. - Call you? - And you're not gonna be an idiot and drive all across town to drop Jessica off - and then come back over here. - I wasn't the only one who was drinking. You were drinking. Stop. Can you keep your voice down, please? My roommates are trying to sleep. What, I'm gonna call you and wake you up? No, you're sleeping. I'm perfectly capable - It doesn't matter. Just don't do it. Don't be a fucking idiot. What?! Don't do it. Just don't. What? Fuck you, man. - Where are you going? - I'm going home, 'cause, apparently, I'm not welcome here. How are you getting home? Stop. You're not driving. - Don't touch me! You're not gonna fucking drunk-drive right now, Mel. Get off me! Fuck. Ow! - What the fuck, Mel? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't fucking touch me. Oh! Fuck. It hurts. Ow! Hey. Fuck! I'm sorry, Dan. I'm sorry. Great, you're dressed. Hi, I'm Dan. Nice to meet you. I'm Mel. Melanie. Okay, all the hard work has been done. It should heal on its own. You don't even have to see a doctor. All right. Okay, great. So how did this happen? Um... I tripped. I just tripped and hit my head on my dresser. Okay. Okay, guys, that's pretty much all I need to know. - Okay. Thank you. - All right. Thanks. My shoes. Hey. How you doing? Yo, yo. I pulled those records you wanted. Cool. Thank you. The shipping labels should be printing right now, and if you could just get those all squared away and send them to that list of journalists I sent you. Cool. You got it. Cool hat. Thank you. Hey, wait. You want a coffee? - Coffee. - I need one really bad. I feel that. Perfect. So what's the deal with your hat, anyway? It's 100 outside. - Ow. - Holy shit! What happened? I hit my head on my dresser last night. Were you drunk, or something? No. No, no, but my girlfriend was. What? We got into this fight 'cause she was drunk - very, very, very drunk - and wanted to drive home. So I was fighting her for her keys and hit my head. And she pushed you? It wasn't that big of a deal, really. Uh-huh. I don't know, that sounds pretty fucked up. Imagine if you had done that to her. I don't know. Did you bleed a lot? Yeah, there was a lot of blood. I spent the whole night in the emergency room. It was really fun. That sucks. Well, a bunch of us are gonna go see that band Fun Friends tonight. You want to come? Oh, nice. Yeah, Mark keeps talking about that. Mm-hmm. Well, text me if you want me to put you on the list. Okay. I have to go back to work. Pshew. Pew pew. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning! Are we all ready for a very great day? Yes. I see some of you peeking over into the corner. - Is there somebody there? - Yes. Are you curious about who that is? Yes! Yes? I hear some yeses. So I would like to introduce to you Miss Clark. Miss Clark is gonna be spending today with us and she's gonna be spending a couple of weeks with us. Can you all give a very, very warm welcome and say "Hi, Miss Clark"? Hi, Miss Clark! Amazing. So tell me - tell me about your plan. Tell me about where you are in school and what you're thinking. Well, I just started my junior year, so I got one more after this and then, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna teach. - You are? - Yeah. What are you thinking? Do you want to do elementary education? I think so, I really do. I just love the kids and I love how open their minds are at this age, you know? Yeah, there's this flowing creativity all the time. Exactly, and they just say things. You were great with them. You were really good today. Thanks. Oh, uh-oh. There we go. - Yeah! Beautiful. - Domino did not make cookies. - Did Navador make you cookies? - No. Who makes cookies? Topo makes cookies. Topo makes the cookies. Dan, have you met Jess? No, I haven't. I just saw the show tonight. It was so good. You guys are amazing. Awesome. Thank you for coming. - Dan's our intern. - Oh, cool. Have you ever had an intern? No. That would be awesome. Oh, my God, we need to get you an intern. - Yeah. - Interns are incredible.

Can't say too much yet, but the next time you come through there, we'll take care of you. Soon enough. Jess, come on. I want to introduce you to some folks. Nice to meet you. Yeah, nice to meet you, too, Jess. Mnh! I saw Dan at the show. He was with all of the like record-label people. Yeah. He didn't say hi. What? Yeah, he was, like, in the back with them all, and... you know. I mean, he waved, but, they're kind of weird. They kind of just make me nervous. - I don't know. - They're so weird. They make me feel so uncomfortable. I'm so happy you said that. It's not just me. - No. - That's weird. Yeah, I saw him and I was like, "Hey, there. " You know, I don't know. Hey, do you ever think about dating anybody else, other than Dan? No. I mean, come on. Come on, what? I'm happy. Don't you ever feel like you're missing out? You don't get bored? - No, I don't get bored. - You've been with him for so long. How do you keep things interesting? Yeah, like do you ever watch porn? - What?! - I'm serious!

Yeah, I mean, you know, they were playing a lot of shows that I was going to and they just graduated last year, but they're sticking around. I know they're fucking working at it, so. I want you to keep an eye on them for me, okay? Every time they record something, if they're playing out live, you come grab me, I'll go check 'em out with you. Cool. Let's go set off some motherfuckin' Chinese lanterns! Shit. Thank you very much. Oh, hey. I don't want to be on camera and eating. So what? You look cute with no pants. 'Cause I'm at home. Yeah! Guess what - I'm a fuckin' filthy fuckin' slut. Yeah. Mmm. Hi-i. How are you? I'm really drunk. Someone had fun. Mm-hmm. I gotta show you this band Mark just showed me. No, not another one. You're gonna like it. You're gonna like it. No, I'm sure I will. Play it tomorrow. What's your fuckin' problem? - Tomorrow. Come on. - Let me play it for you. Just play it tomorrow. Dan, come on. You're being weird. See, look - What the fuck? You watch porn? Were you just about to...? Oh! Just about to what? No, I don't - They said they - They said you were gonna get bored, so I just - I - Your friends are so stupid. Do you watch porn? Uh... Sometimes. - You watch - - No shit, I watch porn. I'm a dude. - Oh, my God. - Does that bother you? Are you bored during sex? No. Are you bored? No! Just relax, okay? If you want to watch porn, we can watch porn. It might be weird. Mnh-mnh. I'm good. It might be fun. What? No. All right. I'm gonna go wash up. So what'd you do at Mark's? It was so fun. You should've come with me. You would've had fun. It was like a big party. Mm-hmm. And the band was there. So good. And then Mark is definitely gonna sign them. And guess what. What? Um, Amanda told me that they don't, um, keep interns for more than a year if they're not gonna hire them, so... Really? - Yeah, but - - Wait, she said that? I mean, yeah, but she just said that, I mean - Well, she wouldn't just say it, right? I'm hoping. I don't know. She's my friend, so she's hoping for me. We'll see what happens. That's awesome. That's fucking awesome. Mm-hmm. Ugh. Don't smoke. It's not good for you, 'cause, then, I'm not gonna kiss you anymore. You don't like kissing me? No. Except for when you wear the cat pants. The cat pajama pants. This is very hot. Where'd you get this little outfit, hmm, some sort of lingerie store? Really? Yeah, I like it. You look real fine. How are your classes? They're good. I'm really sort of... Getting senioritis, you know what I mean? Done with school. I just want to be working. But the internship is going so well. - Good. - I'm just learning so much. Everybody is really gifted over there. Hopefully, there'll be a job when I graduate. No one's said anything yet, but - There are some labels in New York that I'm interested in, but, I have to be here next year for Mel, anyway, so I think it's gonna work out well. Timing will be good. Well, you know, I know we haven't really talked about this, but I want you to know that your father and I, we'd like to help you, if you want to leave Texas. We would pay your rent and your expenses - Really? For a few months, 'til you got settled, like we did with your brother, and - Hi-i-i! - Hi. - Hi! - Sorry I'm late. - It's okay. Sweetie! I had to wait 'til all the kids got picked up. Hi. Hey. Ooh. What's going on? Not much. I'm starving. - Yeah. - Good. Everything okay? Yeah. Great. Very good. Honestly, you know, every time we talked, I told your mom that I thought she should sell that house, even though the real-estate market was crap, you know. Yeah, I don't know. So many memories. I can't even deal with it. I know. Makes me sad, too. I'm gonna miss her being right next door. - You know? - I love you. - Bye. - Thanks for lunch. - Okay, sweetie. - Bye! - What? - Amanda just texted me. Everybody's at the condos. Sounds fun. I don't want to go. The pool's so nasty. What the fuck? You were just saying how badly you want to go out. Now you don't want to go. Not there. - Why not? - I don't want to go there. Why? Give me one good reason. - Because I don't want to go. - That's not a good reason. And I have nothing to wear. I can't go like this. Why not? Why do you need a fucking outfit for every different occasion? I'm not gonna go see all those record-label people and go like this. Who do you think these people are? You think they give a shit? They're all gonna be really drunk, anyway. Let's just go and have a good time and get the fuck out of this house. Please. I have school tomorrow. Since when do you give a shit about school? I give a shit about school. What do you mean? I have better grades than you. We're going. Today's the day. - It's gonna happen. - Mnh-mnh. - Yes, it is! - No! - Come on. - For how long? One drink. One drink, and if you are hating the experience, we can leave. And that's a promise. Please. I'm going crazy. I have cabin fever. - I'm gonna kill you. - Ah! Stop. You're so heavy. So, can we go? Say "please. " Please, can we go? Fine, but you owe me. Yes, yes. Yes. All right, let's do it. Let's go. You owe me. I'm serious. Like bigtime. Okay, really, whatever you want, you got it. You just made my day. Oh, you gotta carry me. Okay, I'm getting up. I'm getting up. Ah-oh-oh! Help me. Milady. Come on. You got it? Dan! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-oo-oo! Danny! Danny, come on. You're really not gonna come in? No. - Hi! - That's Amanda. Hi. Get in, get in. Dan's girlfriend, come on, get in the pool. Yes, do it. Whoo-oo-oo! Can you get me a beer? You got it, yeah. Dan, get us a lot of beer. Just keep it coming. - Hey. - Hi. How are ya? I'm all right. Um, are we gonna go? Right now? You said one drink. Oh. You're not having fun? I'm just tired of dealing. School. I understand. I just - I feel like it's important that I'm here with these people. For work, you know? Yeah. That's cool. I mean, you stay, I'll go. - You sure? - Yeah, it's fine. Can you just text me when you get home, so I know you're safe? I love you. I love you. See ya, kid. Oh, look at them! Shut the fuck up. Are you gonna get in? Come on, let's go swimming! Come on, get in. Come on, let's go swimming. I gotta go. Sorry, I gotta go. But nice to meet you guys. It was so nice to meet you! - Have a good night. - Bye! Do you think we're gonna get sick because of how Mark threw up in the pool only about three weeks ago? I totally forgot about that. A lot of hot dogs. Projectile-vomit hot dogs. -15 hot dogs. - Just whole hot dogs. Sliding in. It was horrible. It was impressive. I was - I was impressed. Yeah, no wonder your girlfriend didn't want to hang out with us. No, but why did she go? She has class in the morning. Yeah? I mean, I have fucking class in the morning, too, but she's a good student and I'm just a fuckup. - Yeah. - I'm just fucked up. How long have you guys been together? 6 years. Whew! What is that? "Whew!" Everyone says, "Wow," "whoa. " 'Cause it's really a long time. I know. Wait, does that mean that she is the only girl you've ever had sex with? What? Uh... Well, well, well. Wait, uh, can I ask you a personal question? When you've been seeing somebody for that many years, is the sex still any good or is it, like, pretty boring? Don't even ask me that, please. I - There's no way to - just don't. Oh, I've just been single for so long that I cannot even imagine what it's like to be with, like in a long-term, one-person, committed. Just don't know. I really can't. You know? Wait, I'm just gonna speak freely here. Just speak freely. Okay. The thing is that, when - whenever I'm dating anyone, even if it's like for like three months or a month, or even a week - I just like, I get so addicted to the sex. All I can think about, all the time. I can't get anything done. I become terrible at my job. Seriously. And then, when I'm single, I just pretty much forget that sex exists altogether. Really? Wow. - I know. - Whoa. Oh. I don't know why I told you that. Brrr! I'm cold. Oh, God. Fuck. I'm sorry I did that. That's okay. - I'm really sorry. - That's okay. I don't know. I don't know. No, it's okay. It's okay. - I'm so sorry. - It's totally okay. - Fuck. I'm so stupid. - Dan. Real smooth, you know? Fuck! It's okay. It's not like I haven't thought about it before. It's fine. Look, I like - really like you, but I really like you as a friend and I, you know, I don't think - I don't want things to get too confusing. Yeah, totally. It's fine. We're fine. We're friends, yeah? Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna go now. - Yeah. - Yeah. All right. Mmm. Hi. You got me breakfast? Mm-hmm. Wait, why didn't you come back here last night? I had texted you and you didn't respond. I didn't want to wake you up. Are you going to the record label? Mm-hmm, but I don't think they're gonna need me for that long, so... Okay. Can we hang out when you're done with class? Mm-hmm. Hey, was that party any fun last night after I left? No, it was stupid. I should've just left with you. Obviously. Thanks for bringing me breakfast. You're so sweet. Why are you the best? I don't know. Hmm. I gotta go. What's wrong? Nothing. What's going on? Nothing. So, you know, how was your night? Oh. The lady. What was her name? Michelle. Oh, it was good. We went to dinner and I took her to a movie, that whole thing, and then, we had sex. Nice, dude. You got laid. Yeah. Yeah, I got laid. "We had sex. " - Was it a nice date? - It was very nice. You gonna call her? Um... Was she a babe? Was she a smoke show? - Stop! - She was quite a smoke show. Where's Becca? I don't know. I called her. She didn't answer. You got pictures? Wait, why the fuck isn't Becca here right now? Why - Why isn't Becca here? Mnh-mnh-mnh. Hold on. Shh! Fuck, my phone's dead. Can I borrow your phone? Mm-hmm. Where is it - oh. It's in there? Yes. You got it. Where the fuck is Dan? What? I think he went over there. What's the matter? Here's your fucking phone. Uh... Hey, Mel? Mel? Mel. Mel, what's going on? Mel. What's up? Amanda, really? What are you talking about? I can't - Mel, what's going on? Stop. Stop fucking pushing me. Fuck you. Agh! Don't touch me! Just don't touch me. Mel. Mel, why don't you just talk to me and tell me what's going on? What the fuck, Dan? You kissed her. You kissed her. She kissed me, okay? And I didn't think it was a big deal. I should've told you. It was a mistake, but I just - it was nothing. That's why I didn't tell you. I said don't touch me! Why don't you just listen to me, okay? It was not - What? I didn't think it mattered, okay? It was just a stupid mistake. Then you would've told me! You would've told me this morning, but you're a fucking liar. Because you - you kissed her! You kissed her! Fuck. Mel, I'm sorry. I fucked up, okay? I'm sorry, but I'll never do it again, okay? - Did you fuck her? - I love you. Answer the question. Did you fuck her? I didn't fuck her. Yeah, but you want to. - Stop it! All right? - You want to! Stop it! Fucking stop hitting me, all right? Ow! Fuck you! Get off me! Get away from the girl! Get away from the girl! Step away. Get on the ground! Get on the ground! You, over there! Put your hands behind your back. I just thought we were coming here to bust up a party. Do you have any weapons on you? - Do you have any weapons on you?! - No! - What are you doing here, huh? - I wasn't doing anything. Mel, please! You been drinkin' tonight? Get up! Mel, say something! Keep them separated. Keep her down! Sit down! What the fuck?! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Wait! No! You can ask for an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand these rights as I've read them to you? Yes. Yes. Wait. What are you doing? - No, this was a mistake. - Ma'am, please, take a seat. I'm sorry, no. We were just talking. This is a big misunderstanding. Keep her down! Sit down! Shut up and take a seat. Ahhhh. Can I help you? Uh, yeah, do you know when Daniel Mercer is gonna be released? Can you spell his last name for me? M- E-R-C-E-R. Well, we can hold him for up to about 24 hours, so I would suggest you maybe come back tomorrow. 24 hours? 24, at least. Okay. Okay, thank you. Take me home, okay? - Dan. - Don't do it. Dan. Dan - Sorry. I don't have anything to say to you. Talk to me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Great job, Luke. Yes? How do you spell "winter?" Winter? W- Mel, are you okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, yeah. I just don't feel good. I'm sorry about that. Well, if you don't feel well, you can go home. Really? Yeah. I got this. Trust me. Okay. Yeah, maybe - maybe it's for the best. I'm sorry. Don't worry. All right, I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you. All right, everybody. Take two more minutes to finish your work. Yes, ma'am! Yes, ma'am. Dan! Thank you. Saved us. Wow. We got a question for ya. Please, sit down. Okay. So... Question... What do you like better, the Early Oughts or the Wild Bucks? The Wild Bucks. Bam. Thank you. Would you like a job? What? Seriously. Would you like a job? You heard us talking about how we're gonna set up that office in Brooklyn. Jason's gonna go out there and run it. I'm gonna be out every once in a while, but we need somebody on the ground there to do the shit he can't do. Um, thank you, guys. This is amazing. I don't know what to say. Sure. It's like an assistant. You help set up shop, get the office running, you'll go see shows. 'Cause I have a newborn and I'll be moving into a house. So I'll be living vicariously through you. Cool. Well, think about it. I would feel much better if you were going out there with me. But I'll talk to y'all later. Okay. Look, I love the initiative you're taking here at Topo and we wouldn't be offering you this job if we didn't think that you were really part of the family. You know, like take a couple of days and think about it, that's fine. I understand you have a life here, you've got a girlfriend. You make choices in life. You know, you win something, you lose something. Man, I can't - can't thank you enough. Absolutely, brother. You earned it. Cool. Get the fuck out of my chair. Okay. Hey. Congrats. Thanks, man. Yeah, no, they shouldn't know the words. They can't possibly. You knew? You fucking knew. Fuck you. Why the fuck didn't you tell me? They made me promise not to tell you. It was - - "They made me promise. " - It was very hard. It was very difficult for me not to tell you. Well, what the fuck? Put 'er there. Yes! I'm sorry. I'm very happy and excited. I'm happy for you. You want to get a drink later to celebrate? Mm-hmm. Yes. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. But, guys, like what if he's there? He's not gonna be there. I'd be surprised if he even knew these people. Someone invited me from class. Okay, you have some really cute things in here. Guys, why isn't he texting me back already? This is so fucking stupid. Oh, my gosh, Mel. Come on, come out with us tonight. It'll be fun to just forget about Dan and just let loose a little bit. No. It's stupid for me to go out. All right. Well, we are gonna get out of here, then. All right. Have fun. Bye, girl. Call us if you wanna come. Bye. Hey, it's Dan. You know what to do. Hey, uh, it's Mel. Um... I, uh - I miss you. Call me back. Bye. So. Um, I just wanted to apologize about that text I sent you the other day. I was really drunk and I know you have a girlfriend and I do not want to be that person. Even - um... Yeah, Mel and I are actually on kind of a... break right now. Well, tonight, we are celebrating you leaving us for Brooklyn, so let's drown your sorrows, huh? Sounds great. Ahem. Ah. I don't know, it's just kind of frustrating right now, 'cause... I just felt like this should be just a purely happy moment and, instead, it's just like "Now, what the fuck do I do?" Uh... You go to Brooklyn. Yeah, that's what you do. Yeah. Yeah, you're going to Brooklyn. You'd be crazy not to. I guess so. I don't know. I totally, totally know what you're going through. My boyfriend and I broke up after we graduated, but it took us about a year, I think, to realize that's what we were doing and, yeah, it just sucked. Finally, after a long while, I realized we were going in totally different directions. But, I mean, maybe that's not what's gonna happen to you. Hey-ey-ey-ey. Aah! What the fuck? You came! I'm so glad you're here. Hey, hey, meet our new friends. This is Will. Hey. Mel. And this is Austin. You came just in time. We are just taking shots. There you go, baby. Wait, wait, wait, wait wait wait wait! - Let's cheers... - To me. To Mel, because we all know you've been going through a rough time. - But you know what? - What? Fuck Dan, because you are so much better than Dan. Who the fuck's Dan? Who the fuck cares? - Fuck 'im. - Yay. I want to do that one next. Dan. Journey? Journey? Absolutely. Hey, guys, guys, pay attention to us. We are the - Make me. Sing away. When you give us something to pay attention to, we'll pay attention. All right, so we're gonna sing a song about love. Oh, you good? More? Ugh. Mnh. Ohh! Fu- Sorry. Ugh! I just want to party forever. Okay, okay. Well, let's take you home, okay? We're just gonna take you home, all right? It'll be fun. I'm gonna go back to the party after this. Hold on, you know, let me just - I have to go pee. Just don't - Ew, that's disgusting. Why does he gotta pee? I cannot believe you - Oh, wait, wait! Aah! Aah! Can I have a little privacy, please? What the fuck? We're tryin' to walk, here! You're gonna take us all out. You're gonna take us all out. Okay, steady. Okay, we're going there. C'mere. Ooh! Okay, c'mere. Do you want your shoes on or off? Well, I guess I'll take them off. Take them off. Okay, your shoes are off. You're at home, okay? I'll tuck you in. I love you, too. We're gonna go back. Don't vomit in your sleep and die, okay? Okay, I'm gonna go back to the party, okay? Are you gonna come back to the party with me? Oh... Mmm, is it...? Do you think I could like crash here? Would that be - Yeah, yeah, that's fine. You can just sleep on the couch, or something, but I'm gonna go back. Okay, cool. All right. Will you just grab her a glass of water, or something, before you go to bed? Uh, yeah, sure. - Thanks. - Yeah, no worries. - Goodnight. - Goodnight! Whoo! That's right. Fuckin' rocks! Yeah! Come on. Come on, Amanda. Knock-knock. Dan? Doctor's orders. You want some water? Mnh, no. You should drink something. Come on. You will - you will - you will thank me in the morning, if you just have some, yeah. One more sip. You should, seriously. You - you will thank me in the morning. Drink some more. Mnh! That's good. Just take - Stop. Stop. Hey. Yeah? Will you lie down with me? Lie down with me, please. Yeah. Move over. Yes, pull. It's so straight. It's not as straight as yours. Why is your hair so straight? - I don't know. - Do you straighten it? - No. - No? no. Okay. Hey. This one's for you, Dan. Oh, yes. Whoo! I don't know this song at all. I don't. Ahem. Dan, the man. There we go. There we go. Yeah! Whoo! Whoo! Huh. Hey, it's me. Stop. What are you doing? What do you think - Stop! Sto- stop! Hey. Ow! What the fuck? Get off me! Fuck! You - get the fuck out of here! Go! I'm going. It's not that fucking big of a deal. Please, just calm down, okay? Yeah, I was about two years old. Wow. Very nice, guys. Very nice. I'll be right back. Mel, I can't understand anything you're saying. I don't - What the fuck, Mel? You call me, you say you're at my house, and you're crying and I have to fuckin' leave and come get you, and, now, you don't want to talk to me? Can you...? All right. He was on top of me. I pushed him off, I pushed him off, 'cause I didn't want to and he - Oh, shit. What happened? What are you talking about? Dan, I didn't even want to go out. I didn't want to go out, but Becca - What are you talking about? He was just everywhere. I pushed him off. Oh! Are you okay? Yeah, I just - I'm fine. What the fuck? Who is this guy? I'm fine. I don't know. He's gone, he left. What did he do to you? Oh, my God. I can't take it. What did he do to you? Nothing. He didn't - I pushed - Can you just hold me, please? You don't understand. I just need you to hold me. I - ahhh. Ohhh. You okay? Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come over here. You don't even want to see me. I shouldn't have come over here. No, that's not true. That's not true. Sorry. Don't be sorry. Don't apologize to me. - Please, don't apologize to me. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was just so scared. Hello? Hey, Mom, it's Dan. Just calling to let you know that Mel and I are gonna come down to Houston this weekend to help Mel's mom pack up the house. I just got back from next door. It's chaos over there, but - Oh, really? Yes. I mean, but it's okay. Do you want to do a dinner Saturday night, the four of us? Oh, yeah, that sounds good. Okay. I'll get it together. All right, I'll call you when we're heading down and I'll see you this weekend. Great, I can't wait. I love you. Give my love to Mel. Love you, too. Okay. Bye-bye. Bye, sweetie. You want some help? No. Oh, God. I can't believe your mom's moving out of this house. Where's the tape? I don't know. Will you come here? C'mere. You okay? I don't know. I think you're done packing. It's the end of my childhood. I have to grow up now? Yeah, I guess so. I guess that's what's happening. But it's not that bad, right? It's kind of a cool thing. Everything fits in boxes. How can you pack up your life in boxes? I don't know, but you've done a great job. - Thanks. - You really did great. - Hey. - Hey. What's up? Do you remember our first time? Mm-hmm. And do you remember that my mom came home? I'm pretty sure she was there during some of it. No! - I think so. - No! 'Cause when we came downstairs, her face was like "How... How is everything? Is everything okay?" Dan, I couldn't look at her. Oh, I remember. Oh! I get embarrassed, just thinking about that. Oh! You just totally ran out on me. I'm sorry. I was like "what the fuck? Where did she go?" Then, we got ice cream. You bought me an ice cream. Yeah. Gentleman. Classy. Hey. Hi. How's it going? Good. How's the packing? Oh, it's a little intense. Mel and her mom, they're upset. - It's hot. - Yeah. Well, you can always take a swim, after. Mm-hmm. I just want to get it through, you know? Get it done with. What are you doing? Oh, emails, nothing. Mm-hmm? I have some news. Um, so, the record label offered me a job in New York. Wow. Yeah. It's cool. Yeah. But I don't know whether or not to do it, you know? Like we - Mel and I - we had a plan. I just don't know what to do. Okay, do you - you want my real answer? Yeah. 'Cause my real answer is that you need to make this decision about you, not Mel and not this relationship. Honey, I know how special it is with you and Mel. You're family to each other and we all are, we're all family. And I love her. This is nothing against Mel. But I am telling you this is a great opportunity and I know you want it. I know you do. And, honestly, if I could tell you anything that was valuable - And I'm talking to you as an adult, now - That if - if I could go back, have it over again, there are things I would change, there are things that I - Like what? Well, I don't know and I'm - this isn't about me or regrets, or anything, it's just I'm trying to share with you that we make decisions, they affect the rest of our lives. I would have maybe gone to grad school and had a career I love and, you know. Please, you know what I'm saying. I know what you're saying. It's kind of stressful. Well, I don't want you to have regrets. Me either. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. This life goes around one time. That's it. - No pressure. - Well, it's true. I know, you're right. Fuck. You know, we want this for you, if it's what you want. So, um... I have to tell you something. The record label offered me a job. What?! Oh, my God. That's amazing. Yeah, I know. I'm superexcited. But it's gonna be in New York and I'm gonna like help open the office there as Jason's assistant, basically. What? In New York? Yeah. I mean, it's gonna be like totally fine. It's just for a year, you know? We'll do long-distance and we'll visit each other, like my freshman year. But that was completely different. It worked out fine, though, and you can come to New York when you graduate. No, you were two hours away, not half the country away. That's okay. We've been together for so long, we could do that. It's nothing. Just listen, okay? I've thought about this. Well, what about us? I've thought about it and - Yeah? We can totally do this long-distance thing for a year. W- Well, well - Why are you reacting this way? Did you take the job? No, I haven't taken it, yet, but I'm going to, obviously. I ca- I can't believe you're doing this. What am I doing? What do you mean? You're leaving! You're going to New York. You can't just decide to do things. Why can't you just be happy for me, okay? This is a job that I've wanted for so long. - No, the job you wanted was here in Austin. - I just want you to be happy for me. This is what we planned for. It's not as if things always happen according to plan. Well, it's not like you can just make the changes. Can't you be a little bit flexible, please? Well, can't you decide something that's not just for yourself? Why can't you think about me? All you think about is yourself and all the things you want. You're saying I'm being selfish and like I try and talk to you about this and you just flip out! You've already made a decision. You flip out at any conversation of me not being with you - It's not a conversation! You flip out. I can't believe you're - You didn't want to see me for two weeks. You just kicked me aside. You ignored me! I did not kick you aside. I asked for space! And you couldn't respect that, in the slightest. You flipped out. It's like you need me and, if I'm not with you all the time, you're gonna fall apart. It is exhausting, being with someone who is so fucking needy. I don't need you! I don't fucking need you, so get out. Okay. Dan, I'm s- I'm - please, Dan, leave right now. You don't want me to leave. I want you to get the fuck out of my house right now! I can't. Dan, go, please! All right, fine. Fuckin' asshole. Fuck you! Fucking little kid. Jesus. Shit! Why do I keep doing this? Hey, Mel? Oh, fuck! He's not picking up. He's not picking up. - C'mere. - God! I have to - I have to - I have to go talk to him. No. Mel, that is not a good idea. I need to talk to him and explain things. God, he can be such a fucking asshole, too. Well, just sleep on it and go talk to him tomorrow. Give him a day. Oh, shit. I fucked this up. Shit. Hey, Amanda. Here? Mm-hmm. - Cool flag. - Thanks. You play that thing? Sometimes. You any good? I don't know. Kind of. Can I play something? Yeah. Oh, my God, I fucking love this record. So fucking good. Unh! Hey. Hi. I have to go. - See you later? - Mm-hmm. I'm gonna go. Come on. You fucking asshole! - Stop! Stop! - What the fuck is wrong with you?! How could you fucking do this to me? I hate you! Aah! You fucking piece of shit! I came here to apologize. How fucking stupid am I? To come here and apologize, see if we could work it out in fucking New York. Shit! You fucking piece of shit! Stop it! Aah! You gonna hit me? Aah! You - Ah! Fuck! Hi. How you feeling? I'm okay. I'm fine. I've been better. Yeah. I'm so embarrassed. Me too. Will you come closer to me, please? I'm really sorry. I love you so much. And I've been thinking about this and... I don't want to go to New York anymore. I don't want to change our plans. I want to make this work. So I'm not going. I think you should take it. No. What are you talking about? Dan, I love you so much. I love you, too. But it doesn't feel right. I can't not see you every day. I can't not be with you. Please don't do this. I don't want to break up. Tell me you love me and you want to spend the rest of your life with me. Look me in the eye and tell me. I'm sorry. Fuck!
