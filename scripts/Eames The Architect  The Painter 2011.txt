00:00:38,394 people refer to themselves 4 00:00:38,471 -- 00:00:39,699 as artists. 5 00:00:39,773 -- 00:00:42,606 It's like referring to themselves as a genius. 6 00:00:45,645 -- 00:00:49,979 MAN: This was a man who was a Merlin of curiosity. 7 00:00:50,050 -- 00:00:52,041 He was driven by his curiosity. 8 00:00:54,854 -- 00:00:56,947 MAN: We weren't sure quite what he was. 9 00:00:57,023 -- 00:00:58,217 Was he an architect? 10 00:00:58,291 -- 00:00:59,383 Was he a designer? 11 00:00:59,459 -- 00:01:00,619 Was he a filmmaker? 12 00:01:00,693 -- 00:01:02,820 But what he was, obviously, 13 00:01:02,896 -- 00:01:04,864 was something we all wanted to be. 14 00:01:06,800 -- 00:01:09,030 RAY EAMES: I had been trained as a painter, 15 00:01:09,102 -- 00:01:12,799 but when we were working on furniture, 16 00:01:12,872 -- 00:01:14,703 and again in film, 17 00:01:14,774 -- 00:01:18,210 it never seemed like leaving painting in any way, 18 00:01:18,278 -- 00:01:20,303 because it was just another form. 19 00:01:20,380 -- 00:01:24,009 WOMAN: She made paintings out of what she was surrounded by. 20 00:01:24,084 -- 00:01:27,918 Everything she touched, she turned into something magical. 21 00:01:27,987 -- 00:01:30,956 MAN: Everything that they did in design, she saw as 22 00:01:31,024 -- 00:01:32,582 an extension of her painting. 23 00:01:32,659 -- 00:01:34,889 And everything they did in design, he saw as an extension 24 00:01:34,961 -- 00:01:36,929 of his architecture. 25 00:01:36,996 -- 00:01:39,760 For them, these names like painter and architect, 26 00:01:39,833 -- 00:01:41,494 they weren't job descriptions. 27 00:01:41,568 -- 00:01:42,967 They were ways of looking at the world. 28 00:01:43,036 -- 00:01:46,233 WOMAN: They were introducing people 29 00:01:46,306 -- 00:01:49,400 to look at the world differently. 30 00:01:49,476 -- 00:01:52,673 Life was fun, was work, was fun, was life. 31 00:01:52,745 -- 00:01:56,545 WOMAN: People would say it was childlike behavior, 32 00:01:56,616 -- 00:01:58,345 but what's wrong with that? 33 00:01:58,418 -- 00:02:01,717 The Eameses have put all this joy back in life. 34 00:02:01,788 -- 00:02:03,619 You know that modernism, let's face it, 35 00:02:03,690 -- 00:02:06,716 was getting boring. 36 00:02:06,793 -- 00:02:09,261 MAN: Had they just designed the furniture, 37 00:02:09,329 -- 00:02:11,229 they'd be in the pantheon. 38 00:02:11,297 -- 00:02:15,199 It's the multifaceted nature of the career 39 00:02:15,268 -- 00:02:18,669 that is extraordinary. 40 00:02:18,738 -- 00:02:22,469 They give shape to America's 20th century. 41 00:02:50,803 -- 00:02:54,000 MAN: I came from an architectural office 42 00:02:54,073 -- 00:02:57,941 where there were individual tables with a conference room, 43 00:02:58,011 -- 00:03:00,445 and there was carpet on the floor. 44 00:03:00,513 -- 00:03:01,673 There were lights. 45 00:03:01,748 -- 00:03:03,909 We had drafting tables, and all the equipment 46 00:03:03,983 -- 00:03:06,076 that you needed, et cetera, et cetera. 47 00:03:06,152 -- 00:03:08,347 I walk into Eames Office, 48 00:03:08,421 -- 00:03:10,355 and it was like walking into a circus. 49 00:03:12,792 -- 00:03:17,661 WOMAN: I walked in the door, and of course I immediately thought, 50 00:03:17,730 -- 00:03:20,426 "Got any jobs here?" 51 00:03:20,500 -- 00:03:26,461 MAN: I'm just totally blown away by the patina on every surface 52 00:03:26,539 -- 00:03:29,531 of graphics, and there were models everywhere, 53 00:03:29,609 -- 00:03:31,099 and there was just stuff. 54 00:03:31,177 -- 00:03:32,542 I was just overwhelmed. 55 00:03:32,612 -- 00:03:36,776 MAN: I saw this incredible apparition 56 00:03:36,849 -- 00:03:39,215 of animation stands 57 00:03:39,285 -- 00:03:41,776 and photographs spread out on tables. 58 00:03:41,854 -- 00:03:44,322 Models being lit for photography, 59 00:03:44,390 -- 00:03:45,755 a screening room, 60 00:03:45,825 -- 00:03:47,725 and a wonderful wood shop. 61 00:03:47,794 -- 00:03:49,591 Salt water tanks. 62 00:03:49,662 -- 00:03:53,428 WOMAN: There were Eames chairs with Steinberg drawings on them. 63 00:03:53,499 -- 00:03:57,094 Every kind of visual treat you can imagine. 64 00:03:57,170 -- 00:03:59,968 And I thought, "I've come to work in Disneyland." 65 00:04:02,141 -- 00:04:04,109 ASHBY: If you had taken the roof off of it, 66 00:04:04,177 -- 00:04:05,940 you would see that place 67 00:04:06,012 -- 00:04:07,502 changing constantly. 68 00:04:07,580 -- 00:04:10,014 So we'd just go around 69 00:04:10,083 -- 00:04:12,574 and take everything out of the middle 70 00:04:12,652 -- 00:04:14,813 of the studio, to put up a movie set 71 00:04:14,887 -- 00:04:17,685 to take pictures tomorrow, and then the next day, 72 00:04:17,757 -- 00:04:20,692 you'd take out all the movie set and put the tables all back up, 73 00:04:20,760 -- 00:04:22,455 and everybody's back at work again. 74 00:04:24,664 -- 00:04:26,427 WOMAN: It was very informal. 75 00:04:26,499 -- 00:04:28,797 I mean, there wasn't ever any kind 76 00:04:28,868 -- 00:04:30,062 of routine. 77 00:04:30,136 -- 00:04:32,696 There were no "regular meetings." 78 00:04:34,274 -- 00:04:37,038 WOMAN: Because I did not have a design degree, 79 00:04:37,110 -- 00:04:40,136 many of the people in the Office thought 80 00:04:40,213 -- 00:04:42,204 I probably shouldn't be there, 81 00:04:42,282 -- 00:04:45,274 but Charles had a differentattitude. 82 00:04:45,351 -- 00:04:47,945 And he said this to me... 83 00:04:48,021 -- 00:04:51,957 "I can teach you how to draw. 84 00:04:52,025 -- 00:04:56,359 "If you can think and you can see, 85 00:04:56,429 -- 00:04:59,523 and you can prove that to me, you can work here." 86 00:04:59,599 -- 00:05:04,002 [Tune chiming] 87 00:05:04,070 -- 00:05:08,370 FRANCO: For four decades, 901 Washington Boulevard 88 00:05:08,441 -- 00:05:10,306 in Venice Beach, California, was one of the most 89 00:05:10,376 -- 00:05:13,072 creative addresses on Earth. 90 00:05:13,146 -- 00:05:15,478 Dozens of gifted young designers 91 00:05:15,548 -- 00:05:18,346 cut their teeth within the walls of the studio. 92 00:05:18,418 -- 00:05:23,151 But the vision for the Office came from the top. 93 00:05:23,222 -- 00:05:27,056 CHARLES EAMES: We have to have a place where you can recognize 94 00:05:27,126 -- 00:05:28,787 where you're going when you start out. 95 00:05:28,861 -- 00:05:30,658 FRANCO: Modern design was born 96 00:05:30,730 -- 00:05:32,925 from the marriage of art and industry. 97 00:05:32,999 -- 00:05:36,400 The Eames Office was born from the marriage 98 00:05:36,469 -- 00:05:39,370 of Ray Kaiser... a painter who rarely painted... 99 00:05:39,439 -- 00:05:42,806 and Charles Eames... an architecture school dropout 100 00:05:42,875 -- 00:05:44,467 who never got his license. 101 00:05:44,544 -- 00:05:49,004 "Eventually, everything connects," Charles said. 102 00:05:49,082 -- 00:05:51,778 Furniture, toys, architecture, 103 00:05:51,851 -- 00:05:54,149 exhibitions, photography, 104 00:05:54,220 -- 00:05:56,085 and film were all connected 105 00:05:56,155 -- 00:05:59,522 in the wild, whimsical world of the Eames Office. 106 00:05:59,592 -- 00:06:04,461 MAN: Charles and Ray Eames wanted to bring 107 00:06:04,530 -- 00:06:06,828 the most magnificent experiences 108 00:06:06,899 -- 00:06:09,561 that you could have with your eyes 109 00:06:09,635 -- 00:06:12,934 to the largest number of people. 110 00:06:13,005 -- 00:06:15,269 I don't think there's anything more important 111 00:06:15,341 -- 00:06:16,672 for an artist to want to do. 112 00:06:16,743 -- 00:06:19,610 FRANCO: It was a career that defined 113 00:06:19,679 -- 00:06:22,011 what it means to be a designer. 114 00:06:22,081 -- 00:06:25,482 And it all began with a chair. 115 00:06:25,551 -- 00:06:29,453 MAN: Charles, where did the classic Eames chair come from? 116 00:06:29,522 -- 00:06:31,422 Did it come to you in a flash, 117 00:06:31,491 -- 00:06:33,516 as you were shaving one morning? 118 00:06:33,593 -- 00:06:35,993 It sort of came to me 119 00:06:36,062 -- 00:06:40,021 in a 30-year flash, if you want. 120 00:06:40,099 -- 00:06:42,397 FRANCO: iTIME/i magazine called it 121 00:06:42,468 -- 00:06:45,733 "the greatest design ofthe 20th century." 122 00:06:45,805 -- 00:06:48,103 But it didn't start out that way. 123 00:06:48,174 -- 00:06:50,938 It began as a failure. 124 00:06:51,010 -- 00:06:53,205 Responding to a competition 125 00:06:53,279 -- 00:06:56,373 at the museum of modern art in 1940, 126 00:06:56,449 -- 00:06:58,417 two unknown young architects... 127 00:06:58,484 -- 00:07:01,817 Charles Eames and his friend, Eero Saarinen, 128 00:07:01,888 -- 00:07:05,619 set out to reinvent the very idea of the chair. 129 00:07:05,691 -- 00:07:08,785 MAN: The goal is to create an inexpensive, 130 00:07:08,861 -- 00:07:11,989 mass-produced chair which is well designed, 131 00:07:12,064 -- 00:07:15,591 and which is molded to the body, because it doesn't need a lot 132 00:07:15,668 -- 00:07:18,296 of upholstery, which is, "a," old-fashioned, 133 00:07:18,371 -- 00:07:20,305 and "b," expensive. 134 00:07:20,373 -- 00:07:22,534 Upholstery is what Louis XIV did. 135 00:07:22,608 -- 00:07:27,807 FRANCO: Working at the Cranbrook Academy of Art near Detroit, 136 00:07:27,880 -- 00:07:29,939 Eames and Saarinen thought they could mold 137 00:07:30,016 -- 00:07:31,745 the new miracle material, plywood, 138 00:07:31,818 -- 00:07:33,080 into two directions at once 139 00:07:33,152 -- 00:07:35,848 to make a comfortable, form-fitting shell. 140 00:07:35,922 -- 00:07:38,152 WOMAN: The critical point 141 00:07:38,224 -- 00:07:41,318 is where that back becomes the seat. 142 00:07:41,394 -- 00:07:44,659 ALBRECHT: The glues aren't good enough, and the chair splinters, 143 00:07:44,730 -- 00:07:45,958 which means, when you'd sit on it, 144 00:07:46,032 -- 00:07:47,294 it would be a little uncomfortable. 145 00:07:47,366 -- 00:07:49,357 So they have to upholster it. 146 00:07:49,435 -- 00:07:51,164 FRANCO: Despite failing 147 00:07:51,237 -- 00:07:54,673 at their goal of creating a single-piece plywood shell, 148 00:07:54,740 -- 00:07:58,972 Charles and Eero won the competition. 149 00:07:59,045 -- 00:08:02,776 WOMAN: The irony is that 150 00:08:02,849 -- 00:08:05,647 the chair that Eames and Saarinen designed, 151 00:08:05,718 -- 00:08:08,016 they couldn't really manufacture. 152 00:08:08,087 -- 00:08:12,148 FRANCO: Even with the upholstery to cover the cracked surface, 153 00:08:12,225 -- 00:08:15,854 no existing machine could successfully mold the plywood 154 00:08:15,928 -- 00:08:18,123 into the shape of the chair. 155 00:08:18,197 -- 00:08:19,425 MAN: It couldn't be made 156 00:08:19,499 -- 00:08:22,059 in the way that they claimed it could be made. 157 00:08:22,134 -- 00:08:23,829 They had designed the look of it 158 00:08:23,903 -- 00:08:25,837 without designing the substance of it. 159 00:08:25,905 -- 00:08:29,671 FRANCO: After many unsuccessful attempts, 160 00:08:29,742 -- 00:08:31,801 Eero Saarinen scrapped the project. 161 00:08:31,878 -- 00:08:34,005 But Charles wasn't ready to give up... 162 00:08:34,080 -- 00:08:36,776 this time, with a new partner. 163 00:08:36,849 -- 00:08:36,883 At Cranbrook, he had become friendly with Ray Kaiser, 164 00:08:36,883 -- 00:08:40,876 At Cranbrook, he had become friendly with Ray Kaiser, 165 00:08:40,953 -- 00:08:45,083 a talented young artistwho had helped with the chair project. 166 00:08:45,157 -- 00:08:46,818 MARILYN NEUHART: I said to Ray one day, 167 00:08:46,893 -- 00:08:49,691 "How did you and Charles get together?" 168 00:08:49,762 -- 00:08:52,697 "Oh! I can't talk about it." 169 00:08:52,765 -- 00:08:53,823 I said, "Well, why not?" 170 00:08:53,900 -- 00:08:55,959 "Well, we just did." 171 00:08:56,035 -- 00:08:59,801 DEMETRIOS: They sparked, and the rest is literally history. 172 00:08:59,872 -- 00:09:01,362 And I think in Ray, 173 00:09:01,440 -- 00:09:03,237 he really found his complement. 174 00:09:03,309 -- 00:09:05,800 FRANCO: But there was a problem. 175 00:09:05,878 -- 00:09:08,574 Charles was already married. 176 00:09:08,648 -- 00:09:11,583 He had moved up to Cranbrook from St. Louis 177 00:09:11,651 -- 00:09:15,314 with his wife, Catherine, and his young daughter, Lucia. 178 00:09:15,388 -- 00:09:23,295 KIRKHAM: The love letters are Charles's letters to Ray, 179 00:09:23,362 -- 00:09:26,923 because the letters that Ray wrote back to Charles, 180 00:09:26,999 -- 00:09:29,934 Charles destroyed, because he was married. 181 00:09:30,002 -- 00:09:33,768 They show Charles madly in love with her. 182 00:09:33,839 -- 00:09:35,670 There's no doubt about that. 183 00:09:35,741 -- 00:09:38,141 He talks about walking past 184 00:09:38,210 -- 00:09:39,871 the building that she used to live in 185 00:09:39,946 -- 00:09:41,140 and looking up at her window, 186 00:09:41,213 -- 00:09:43,408 and they are very moving. 187 00:09:43,482 -- 00:09:47,919 These letters are talking about 188 00:09:47,987 -- 00:09:54,415 a joined future as artists together. 189 00:09:54,493 -- 00:09:57,758 I think his decision feels made. 190 00:09:57,830 -- 00:10:02,733 Ray certainly felt uncomfortable enough to leave Cranbrook 191 00:10:02,802 -- 00:10:05,100 and go away and think about 192 00:10:05,171 -- 00:10:08,436 what she was going to do thereafter. 193 00:10:10,710 -- 00:10:13,838 DEMETRIOS: Catherine was a very impressive person. 194 00:10:13,913 -- 00:10:16,177 Knowing them both, as I did, 195 00:10:16,248 -- 00:10:20,082 you can see why they didn't stay together. 196 00:10:20,152 -- 00:10:24,418 He really thought he had something to offer the world, 197 00:10:24,490 -- 00:10:27,687 and this was going to be a journey 198 00:10:27,760 -- 00:10:30,661 with a lot of unexpectedness. 199 00:10:30,730 -- 00:10:34,325 This was ajourney that might not lead to, uh, success. 200 00:10:34,400 -- 00:10:36,493 And I think that maybe at that point in her life, 201 00:10:36,569 -- 00:10:37,934 this was not necessarily 202 00:10:38,004 -- 00:10:42,270 the place that Catherine wanted to go. 203 00:10:42,341 -- 00:10:44,536 But I think that maybe in Charles's mind 204 00:10:44,610 -- 00:10:49,274 that he had wanted a life where love and work 205 00:10:49,348 -- 00:10:52,078 and life and work were all blended together. 206 00:10:54,320 -- 00:10:56,811 FRANCO: Charles quit hisjob at Cranbrook, 207 00:10:56,889 -- 00:11:01,883 and, in one last letterto Ray, asked for her hand in marriage. 208 00:11:06,132 -- 00:11:07,599 His future with his new bride 209 00:11:07,667 -- 00:11:12,161 now depended on making the chairwork. 210 00:11:15,908 -- 00:11:18,706 Broke and short on options, 211 00:11:18,778 -- 00:11:21,611 Charles and Ray headed from Michigan to L.A. 212 00:11:21,681 -- 00:11:24,616 To finish what he had started. 213 00:11:24,684 -- 00:11:27,278 DEMETRIOS: Part of this journey to California was 214 00:11:27,353 -- 00:11:29,253 they were both going to figure out 215 00:11:29,321 -- 00:11:32,552 how to mass-produce molded plywood and compound curves... 216 00:11:32,625 -- 00:11:34,957 which sounds very unromantic, but I think it probably 217 00:11:35,027 -- 00:11:37,052 was pretty romantic, under the circumstances. 218 00:11:37,129 -- 00:11:40,758 FRANCO: In their two-bedroom apartment in Westwood Village, 219 00:11:40,833 -- 00:11:44,291 Charles and Ray set up a makeshift workshop. 220 00:11:44,370 -- 00:11:46,838 RAY EAMES: The... the first to... 221 00:11:46,906 -- 00:11:48,498 that did the molding, 222 00:11:48,574 -- 00:11:51,065 which was so magic, 223 00:11:51,143 -- 00:11:53,703 we called it by a magic name. 224 00:11:53,779 -- 00:11:56,009 So we called it "Kazam!" 225 00:11:56,082 -- 00:12:00,280 FRANCO: The "Kazam!" machine was a jury-rigged molding device 226 00:12:00,352 -- 00:12:03,014 made out of heating coils and a bicycle pump. 227 00:12:03,089 -- 00:12:06,855 But in 1942, with the nation at war, 228 00:12:06,926 -- 00:12:11,829 raw materials were scarce, and the "Kazam!" lay silent. 229 00:12:15,101 -- 00:12:19,435 But with the setback, there was also opportunity. 230 00:12:19,505 -- 00:12:23,669 The U.S. Military needed better splints. 231 00:12:23,743 -- 00:12:26,940 DEMETRIOS: The standard-issue splint was metallic, 232 00:12:27,012 -- 00:12:28,809 and so the vibration of the two people carrying them 233 00:12:28,881 -- 00:12:31,145 actually would make the wound worse. 234 00:12:31,217 -- 00:12:32,514 They would actually be better off 235 00:12:32,585 -- 00:12:34,553 if you grabbed a stick off the ground and tied it to it 236 00:12:34,620 -- 00:12:35,780 than with this amplification. 237 00:12:35,855 -- 00:12:38,085 So Charles and Ray said, "Well, you know, 238 00:12:38,157 -- 00:12:40,387 we're experimenting with molded plywood. 239 00:12:40,459 -- 00:12:42,723 Why don't we try and design a new splint?" 240 00:12:42,795 -- 00:12:46,287 They're trying to make a three-dimensional curve, 241 00:12:46,365 -- 00:12:47,593 kind of a bowl, you might say. 242 00:12:47,666 -- 00:12:49,429 They can't quite do it yet. 243 00:12:49,502 -- 00:12:52,062 So they need holes in the plywood 244 00:12:52,138 -- 00:12:53,264 in order to release the tension, 245 00:12:53,339 -- 00:12:54,772 'cause otherwise it's going to splinter 246 00:12:54,840 -- 00:12:55,829 where they try to do it. 247 00:12:55,908 -- 00:12:57,432 But working within the constraints, 248 00:12:57,510 -- 00:12:59,501 what's nice is that this is exactly what you need 249 00:12:59,578 -- 00:13:01,978 for a splint, 'cause you need a place for the bandages to go. 250 00:13:02,047 -- 00:13:05,915 FRANCO: In a rented warehouse space, 251 00:13:05,985 -- 00:13:08,852 their team of skilled designers and craftspeople 252 00:13:08,921 -- 00:13:12,288 made 150,000 splints. 253 00:13:12,358 -- 00:13:15,418 With peace approaching, Charles and Ray 254 00:13:15,494 -- 00:13:17,792 had one thing on their minds... 255 00:13:17,863 -- 00:13:20,627 applying the lessons of the splints 256 00:13:20,699 -- 00:13:23,167 to the failed plywood chairs. 257 00:13:23,235 -- 00:13:27,262 This time, they wouldn't design the look of the chair first. 258 00:13:27,339 -- 00:13:30,137 DEMETRIOS: They would never make that mistake again. 259 00:13:30,209 -- 00:13:33,110 They would let the design flow from the learning. 260 00:13:33,179 -- 00:13:36,342 FRANCO: That meant knowing who they were serving. 261 00:13:36,415 -- 00:13:37,575 In Charles's words, 262 00:13:37,650 -- 00:13:39,447 it was always about being 263 00:13:39,518 -- 00:13:41,509 a good host to their guests. 264 00:13:41,587 -- 00:13:45,580 CHARLES EAMES: The people we wanted to serve were varied, 265 00:13:45,658 -- 00:13:49,150 and to begin with we studied the shape and postures 266 00:13:49,228 -- 00:13:52,425 of many types... averages and extremes. 267 00:13:55,534 -- 00:13:57,058 FRANCO: But it was more than just a search 268 00:13:57,136 -- 00:13:59,604 for the best chair design. 269 00:13:59,672 -- 00:14:02,800 It was the beginning of the Eames design process, 270 00:14:02,875 -- 00:14:06,572 a process of learning by doing. 271 00:14:06,645 -- 00:14:09,307 CHARLES EAMES: In the design of any structure, 272 00:14:09,381 -- 00:14:11,246 it is often the connection 273 00:14:11,317 -- 00:14:14,753 that provides the key to the solution. 274 00:14:14,820 -- 00:14:18,381 FRANCO: "Never delegate understanding," Charles said. 275 00:14:18,457 -- 00:14:21,949 It would become a hallmark of Eames design, 276 00:14:22,027 -- 00:14:23,858 their secret ingredient. 277 00:14:23,929 -- 00:14:26,295 MAN: Charles said, yeah, there's a secret. 278 00:14:26,365 -- 00:14:29,357 First you have an idea, then you discard the idea, 279 00:14:29,435 -- 00:14:33,201 then you have 50 other ideas and you discard them, 280 00:14:33,272 -- 00:14:36,730 and then you do several models, and they don't work, 281 00:14:36,809 -- 00:14:38,367 and you throw them out. 282 00:14:38,444 -- 00:14:41,880 And the secret is work and work and work and work and work. 283 00:14:41,947 -- 00:14:47,385 FRANCO: The plywood furniture was good to go in 1946. 284 00:14:47,453 -- 00:14:49,580 Charles said of the furniture, 285 00:14:49,655 -- 00:14:54,820 "We wanted to make the best for the most for the least." 286 00:14:54,894 -- 00:14:56,589 That sentiment struck a chord 287 00:14:56,662 -- 00:14:59,222 with the Herman Miller furniture company. 288 00:14:59,298 -- 00:15:02,495 Honest and simple in its use of materials, 289 00:15:02,568 -- 00:15:06,504 the plywood furniture was also affordable for the common man. 290 00:15:06,572 -- 00:15:10,201 Together, they would become one of the great success stories 291 00:15:10,276 -- 00:15:12,141 of the postwar era. 292 00:15:19,718 -- 00:15:23,085 ALBRECHT: Charles and Ray Eames provide much of the furniture 293 00:15:23,155 -- 00:15:25,988 for a kind of Upper-middle-class, 294 00:15:26,058 -- 00:15:27,491 educated audience 295 00:15:27,559 -- 00:15:29,424 moving to suburbia. 296 00:15:29,495 -- 00:15:31,895 When the Second World War ended, 297 00:15:31,964 -- 00:15:34,956 it wasn't just five years of pent-up demand. 298 00:15:35,034 -- 00:15:36,934 It was actually almost 15 years, 299 00:15:37,002 -- 00:15:39,300 because you also have 10 years of the Depression. 300 00:15:39,371 -- 00:15:42,363 And people have much more money, 301 00:15:42,441 -- 00:15:44,272 so if you wanted to sort of do something 302 00:15:44,343 -- 00:15:48,006 differentthan your parents, you boughtthat Eames furniture. 303 00:15:49,882 -- 00:15:53,443 And itwas promoted that way. 304 00:15:53,519 -- 00:15:55,510 Everything around the marketing suggested, 305 00:15:55,587 -- 00:15:58,852 "Here is something new for a new society." 306 00:15:58,924 -- 00:16:01,916 And America was a new society in '45. 307 00:16:05,197 -- 00:16:07,358 FRANCO: In the decades to follow, 308 00:16:07,433 -- 00:16:09,594 Charles and Ray scored success 309 00:16:09,668 -- 00:16:12,762 with line after line of Eames furniture. 310 00:16:12,838 -- 00:16:14,271 And their unmistakable designs 311 00:16:14,340 -- 00:16:17,207 became a ubiquitous part of American culture, 312 00:16:17,276 -- 00:16:21,269 right up to today. 313 00:16:21,347 -- 00:16:23,838 Sold for $900, 232. 314 00:16:23,916 -- 00:16:28,478 I think the work retains a real freshness. 315 00:16:28,554 -- 00:16:32,285 Elements of it still inform contemporary design today. 316 00:16:32,358 -- 00:16:34,383 AUCTIONEER: $700. 317 00:16:34,460

The rightness of the furniture 325 00:16:46,505 -- 00:16:49,599 will continue to appeal 326 00:16:49,675 -- 00:16:52,576 to new generations. 327 00:16:52,644 -- 00:16:56,080 MAN: The word "Eames" has now become a generic word. 328 00:16:56,148 -- 00:17:00,482 I mean, if you go on eBay, it always says, "Eames era" 329 00:17:00,552 -- 00:17:02,645 blah, blah, blah. 330 00:17:02,721 -- 00:17:04,484 So it's become a word like "Victorian." 331 00:17:04,556 -- 00:17:06,717 Maybe it's, in a way, accurate, 332 00:17:06,792 -- 00:17:09,056 because just like Queen Victoria 333 00:17:09,128 -- 00:17:11,653 represents an attitude, 334 00:17:11,730 -- 00:17:15,359 Eames also embodies a certain approach 335 00:17:15,434 -- 00:17:18,130 to life and to thinking. 336 00:17:18,203 -- 00:17:20,831

339 00:17:27,379 -- 00:17:29,040 into American capitalism. 340 00:17:29,114 -- 00:17:30,775 At that price, the customer knows 341 00:17:30,849 -- 00:17:32,248 exactly what he's going to get. 342

Office, 354 00:17:59,278 -- 00:18:02,714 there was always the lingering question of credit. 355 00:18:02,781 -- 00:18:05,875 SUSSMAN: There are still some sore issues 356 00:18:05,951 -- 00:18:09,978

gave Charles a one-man show. 362 00:18:28,040 -- 00:18:33,103 ALBRECHT: MOMA gives the name Charles Eames, 363 00:18:33,178 -- 00:18:37,012 and this causes a certain tension in the Office, 364 00:18:37,082 -- 00:18:39,778 because it was thought to be a collaborative effort. 365 00:18:39,852 -- 00:18:44,312 MAN: It's not that he's swooping in or is doing nothing 366 00:18:44,389 --

amount of work, 397 00:20:16,348 -- 00:20:18,316 I think, are they capable of saying, 398 00:20:18,383 -- 00:20:19,873 "I did this, this, and this 399 00:20:19,952 -- 00:20:22,113 in the Eames Office with no credit." 400 00:20:22,187 -- 00:20:27,853 WOMAN: I think he ran the Office a bit like a Renaissance studio. 401 00:20:27,926 -- 00:20:29,359 You know, there's a master painter, 402 00:20:29,428 -- 00:20:31,623 but then there are all the other people 403 00:20:31,697 -- 00:20:33,062 who help realize the work. 404 00:20:36,735 -- 00:20:39,966 OPPEWALL: He may have been exploiting us, 405 00:20:40,038 -- 00:20:42,632 but if you were not stupid, 406 00:20:42,708 -- 00:20:46,644 you were also exploiting that relationship. 407 00:20:46,712 -- 00:20:48,475 I was happy, 408 00:20:48,547 -- 00:20:51,607 being exploited 409 00:20:51,683 -- 00:20:54,811 by a proper master. 410 00:20:59,057 -- 00:21:01,025 MAN: The most wonderful work is... 411 00:21:01,093 -- 00:21:04,256 is the conscience and the talents of a person 412 00:21:04,329 -- 00:21:06,490 who have every right to have their name on it, 413 00:21:06,565 -- 00:21:08,863 even though it's done by minions of other people. 414 00:21:08,934 -- 00:21:11,903 Things good and bad, 415 00:21:11,970 -- 00:21:15,565 he rightfully has his name on them, and they rightfully 416 00:21:15,641 -- 00:21:19,509 are Charles Eames or Charles and Ray Eames products. 417 00:21:19,578 -- 00:21:19,878 ARLENE FRANCIS: Almost always, when there's a successful man, 418 00:21:19,878 -- 00:21:24,838 ARLENE FRANCIS: Almost always, when there's a successful man, 419 00:21:24,916 -- 00:21:27,976 there is a very interesting and able woman behind him. 420 00:21:28,053 -- 00:21:30,521 And a better case could seldom be found 421 00:21:30,589 -- 00:21:32,386 than in Ray and Charles Eames. 422 00:21:32,457 -- 00:21:33,981 Come on in, Ray. 423 00:21:34,059 -- 00:21:35,993 Hello, I'm so happy to see you. 424 00:21:36,061 -- 00:21:38,427 This is Mrs. Eames, and she's going to tell us 425 00:21:38,497 -- 00:21:40,362 how she helps Charles design these chairs. 426 00:21:40,432 -- 00:21:41,694 How do you manage that? 427 00:21:41,767 -- 00:21:44,361 Well, uh, aside from serving 428 00:21:44,436 -- 00:21:47,132 as an extreme in the testing, 429 00:21:47,205 -- 00:21:50,174 there are a million things, 430 00:21:50,242 -- 00:21:54,235 but, uh, I think the most difficult thing 431 00:21:54,313 -- 00:21:56,611 is to keep the big idea, 432 00:21:56,682 -- 00:21:59,947 to be able to look critically at the work. 433 00:22:00,018 -- 00:22:04,751 ALBRECHT: Arlene Francis is clearly having a hard time 434 00:22:04,823 -- 00:22:08,657 with this husband and wife working together. 435 00:22:08,727 -- 00:22:11,457 You know, this is the era of "Mad Men," 436 00:22:11,530 -- 00:22:13,088 as we're watching now. 437 00:22:13,165 -- 00:22:14,826 This is not fitting. 438 00:22:14,900 -- 00:22:19,837 And Charles Eames is trying to promote Ray Eames, 439 00:22:19,905 -- 00:22:22,430 as saying that, "We collaborated on this." 440 00:22:22,507 -- 00:22:25,135 CHARLES EAMES: Well, uh, Ray... Ray was a painter. 441 00:22:25,210 -- 00:22:28,407 Ray worked here in New York with Hans Hofmann for a long time, 442 00:22:28,480 -- 00:22:29,970 which is a pretty good start. 443 00:22:30,048 -- 00:22:32,278 KIRKHAM: I actually thought Charles was more embarrassed 444 00:22:32,351 -- 00:22:33,375 than Ray. 445 00:22:33,452 -- 00:22:35,283 Ray is hidden away. 446 00:22:35,354 -- 00:22:39,791 Charles is being highlighted, the great male designer. 447 00:22:39,858 -- 00:22:42,053 It's a very interesting moment 448 00:22:42,127 -- 00:22:45,324 of American sexual politics in the 1950s. 449 00:22:45,397 -- 00:22:47,888 Uh, I wonder if you're going to maybe take us through 450 00:22:47,966 -- 00:22:50,332 and show how... how the Eames chair has developed. 451 00:22:50,402 -- 00:22:52,165 And, Ray, shall we let Charles do it, 452 00:22:52,237 -- 00:22:53,329 or do you want to help with it? 453 00:22:53,405 -- 00:22:54,667 Please, please. 454 00:22:54,740 -- 00:22:57,106 No, you see, as I told you, she is ibehind/i the man, 455 00:22:57,175 -- 00:22:58,233 but terribly important. 456 00:22:58,310 -- 00:22:59,971 Thank you, Ray. All right, Charles... 457 00:23:00,045 -- 00:23:03,276 SUSSMAN: The feminist conscience had not been yet raised. 458 00:23:03,348 -- 00:23:08,411 Ray would always stand behind Charles. 459 00:23:08,487 -- 00:23:13,015 And on camera or in interviews, she said hardly anything. 460 00:23:13,091 -- 00:23:15,924 EDWARD P. MORGAN: Her warm but quiet conversation 461 00:23:15,994 -- 00:23:18,462 shrank to total silence before the camera, 462 00:23:18,530 -- 00:23:21,363 but her impact on Eames' work spoke for her. 463 00:23:21,433 -- 00:23:24,561 She sat like a delicious dumpling in a doll's dress, 464 00:23:24,636 -- 00:23:26,866 concentrating on a sweep of subjects 465 00:23:26,938 -- 00:23:30,305 which would seemingly choke a computer. 466 00:23:30,375 -- 00:23:32,206 ASHBY: People always made the mistake 467 00:23:32,277 -- 00:23:35,735 that Charles and Ray, itwas two brothers. 468 00:23:35,814 -- 00:23:37,873 They were a married couple, 469 00:23:37,949 -- 00:23:40,747 while at the same time, they were partners 470 00:23:40,819 -- 00:23:43,219 in whatever their design effortwas. 471 00:23:43,288 -- 00:23:47,554 OPPEWALL: Ray felt, I think, 472 00:23:47,626 -- 00:23:50,993 deeply enraged and hurt, on occasion, 473 00:23:51,062 -- 00:23:55,021 when itwas assumed that it was 474 00:23:55,100 -- 00:23:58,866 actually just Charles's business 475 00:23:58,937 -- 00:24:00,996 and it was the office of Charles Eames, 476 00:24:01,072 -- 00:24:03,870 not the office of Charles and Ray Eames. 477 00:24:03,942 -- 00:24:07,742 It iwas/i Charles who was in charge, 478 00:24:07,813 -- 00:24:10,179 but the body of work would not have been the same 479 00:24:10,248 -- 00:24:12,216 without Ray's contributions, 480 00:24:12,284 -- 00:24:16,516 and how you separate that out, I don't know. 481 00:24:16,588 -- 00:24:19,751 FRANCO: If the public saw Ray as little more 482 00:24:19,825 -- 00:24:22,385 than the devoted wife supporting her husband, 483 00:24:22,461 -- 00:24:25,953 Charles saw a talented artist who had participated 484 00:24:26,031 -- 00:24:29,091 in the birth of abstract art in America. 485 00:24:29,167 -- 00:24:32,295 Her mentor was the German abstract expressionist 486 00:24:32,370 -- 00:24:34,099 Hans Hofmann. 487 00:24:34,172 -- 00:24:37,300 PERL: Hofmann is one of the great catalytic figures 488 00:24:37,375 -- 00:24:39,002 in American art. 489 00:24:39,077 -- 00:24:43,514 He starts a school in New York City in '33 490 00:24:43,582 -- 00:24:46,745 with at times no more than a dozen or two students. 491 00:24:46,818 -- 00:24:50,777 They, together, are the seed out of which 492 00:24:50,856 -- 00:24:53,416 the new American art really grows. 493 00:24:58,663 -- 00:25:00,995 He was getting ideas from people 494 00:25:01,066 -- 00:25:04,160 like Mondrian, Paul Klee, Kandinsky, 495 00:25:04,236 -- 00:25:06,932 but he was communicating them 496 00:25:07,005 -- 00:25:12,307 not as textbook learning, but as this incredibly visceral 497 00:25:12,377 -- 00:25:14,106 sensation. 498 00:25:14,179 -- 00:25:18,639 And I have talked to people who remember him 499 00:25:18,717 -- 00:25:21,880 walking into the studio and looking at a drawing of theirs 500 00:25:21,953 -- 00:25:24,183 and tearing it down the middle 501 00:25:24,256 -- 00:25:27,987 and then taking the two parts and moving them. 502 00:25:28,059 -- 00:25:30,926 And then suddenly something that had been very static 503 00:25:30,996 -- 00:25:32,293 was dynamic. 504 00:25:34,099 -- 00:25:37,000 KIRKHAM: So I think it's there that Ray learned 505 00:25:37,068 -- 00:25:40,401 some, at least, of this wonderful capacity that she had 506 00:25:40,472 -- 00:25:43,635 for collaging, forjuxtaposition. 507 00:25:43,708 -- 00:25:46,575 She could move things around very, very easily 508 00:25:46,645 -- 00:25:50,103 and beautifully and find form, 509 00:25:50,181 -- 00:25:54,345 and find form in relation to otherform. 510 00:25:58,490 -- 00:26:02,324 SUSSMAN: Ray knew what was art 511 00:26:02,394 -- 00:26:04,021 and whatwas not. 512 00:26:04,095 -- 00:26:09,590 And Charles depended on her aesthetic genius. 513 00:26:09,668 -- 00:26:14,696 OPPEWALL: And she would put objects on shoots 514 00:26:14,773 -- 00:26:18,402 that would just bring the whole thing to life. 515 00:26:20,211 -- 00:26:24,944 By putting the stack of black wire chairs 516 00:26:25,016 -- 00:26:28,144 naked with the wooden bird 517 00:26:28,219 -- 00:26:30,084 with the little wire legs, 518 00:26:30,155 -- 00:26:34,489 gave you a very different feeling about those chairs. 519 00:26:36,595 -- 00:26:39,257 ASHBY: Charles could not deal with the idea 520 00:26:39,331 -- 00:26:41,993 that any of the furniture would have color on it. 521 00:26:42,067 -- 00:26:44,092 If you put a palette of colors in front of him, 522 00:26:44,169 -- 00:26:46,160 they just... like he couldn't handle it. 523 00:26:46,237 -- 00:26:48,671 It just went over his head. 524 00:26:48,740 -- 00:26:51,265 He deferred to her completely on color sense. 525 00:26:51,343 -- 00:26:54,335 BEEBE: She saw everything as a painting. 526 00:26:54,412 -- 00:26:56,937 She had these enormous eyes that were... 527 00:26:57,015 -- 00:26:59,381 they were open like this all the time. 528 00:26:59,451 -- 00:27:02,648 And I think Charles was very dependent on that. 529 00:27:02,721 -- 00:27:05,121 SUSSMAN: You could just hear him say, 530 00:27:05,190 -- 00:27:07,090 "Ra-ay!" 531 00:27:07,158 -- 00:27:09,023 Which meant, "Come and help!" 532 00:27:09,094 -- 00:27:11,324 FRANCO: At the Library of Congress, 533 00:27:11,396 -- 00:27:14,888 Ray's letters to a traveling Charles 534 00:27:14,966 -- 00:27:16,991 show her fastidious attention to every detail 535 00:27:17,068 -- 00:27:18,695 of their life and work. 536 00:27:18,770 -- 00:27:21,534 MAN: When she writes to Charles in Paris 537 00:27:21,606 -- 00:27:24,973 and she's talking about the slides that he's just taken, 538 00:27:25,043 -- 00:27:27,534 and she has this sketch showing how she 539 00:27:27,612 -- 00:27:31,207 and Sandro and Don Albinson have changed the chair. 540 00:27:31,282 -- 00:27:33,773 And then she's going on about the films, 541 00:27:33,852 -- 00:27:35,786 and she's going on about Elmer Bernstein. 542 00:27:35,854 -- 00:27:38,448 Then she tells him all the places to shop in Paris 543 00:27:38,523 -- 00:27:39,956 and where to get his shoes 544 00:27:40,025 -- 00:27:41,253 and where to get her gloves 545 00:27:41,326 -- 00:27:43,385 and whatthe stitching should be like on the gloves 546 00:27:43,461 -- 00:27:47,420 and how this perfume by Balmain is $55 an ounce here, 547 00:27:47,499 -- 00:27:50,764 but it's cheaper in Paris, "and please get it for me." 548 00:27:53,104 -- 00:27:54,969 SELIGSOHN: It's as if they were one individual 549 00:27:55,040 -- 00:27:57,873 with two different special areas, 550 00:27:57,942 -- 00:27:59,773 and a lot of itwas unspoken, 551 00:27:59,844 -- 00:28:02,074 just eye... eye contact. 552 00:28:02,147 -- 00:28:03,774 A nodding of something... an idea 553 00:28:03,848 -- 00:28:05,816 thatthey both would agree on. 554 00:28:05,884 -- 00:28:09,547 PEATROSS: So that's how you begin to separate 555 00:28:09,621 -- 00:28:12,385 their artistic personalities and their contributions. 556 00:28:12,457 -- 00:28:15,051 But the separating them isn't the important part. 557 00:28:15,126 -- 00:28:18,186 It's what they created together. 558 00:28:18,263 -- 00:28:20,959 That's why it's so good. 559 00:28:25,670 -- 00:28:28,571 FRANCO: Perhaps the greatest Eames design of all 560 00:28:28,640 -- 00:28:31,837 was the image of Charles and Ray. 561 00:28:34,612 -- 00:28:37,672 Their playful self-portraits, eccentric dress, 562 00:28:37,749 -- 00:28:40,513 and quotable quotes all contributed 563 00:28:40,585 -- 00:28:43,418 to the endearing picture of a happy, modern couple 564 00:28:43,488 -- 00:28:45,922 absorbed in the challenges of their work. 565 00:28:45,990 -- 00:28:49,983 Charles and Ray were cultural icons, 566 00:28:50,061 -- 00:28:55,897 but their public face masked a deep desire for privacy. 567 00:28:55,967 -- 00:28:59,664 After long hours at 901, 568 00:28:59,738 -- 00:29:02,070 they would retreat to the home they built 569 00:29:02,140 -- 00:29:04,608 in Pacific Palisades. 570 00:29:04,676 -- 00:29:08,373 SUSSMAN: Charles and Ray were their own community, 571 00:29:08,446 -- 00:29:12,405 and we were in the satellite group. 572 00:29:12,484 -- 00:29:14,111 And so was everybody else. 573 00:29:14,185 -- 00:29:22,149 ASHBY: I had no sense that they were trying to keep out 574 00:29:22,227 -- 00:29:25,196 the outside world or anything else. 575 00:29:25,263 -- 00:29:28,357 They had created a world and a lifestyle 576 00:29:28,433 -- 00:29:31,300 that just required them to go 577 00:29:31,369 -- 00:29:34,395 in this tunnel from their house 578 00:29:34,472 -- 00:29:37,373 to the work, you know, back home again, 579 00:29:37,442 -- 00:29:40,673 so what you surround yourself

they're all based upon trying to create 583 00:29:47,786 -- 00:29:52,348 a seamless environment and a seamless life. 584 00:29:52,423 -- 00:29:57,884 FRANCO: Originally, the house was designed by

00:55:14,967 so when you pointed to this screen, 1064 00:55:15,045 -- 00:55:17,912 what you were talking about appeared on this screen. 1065 00:55:17,981 -- 00:55:20,449 And the same with that screen and all the others. 1066 00:55:20,517 -- 00:55:24,681 Butthe problem was, 1067 00:55:24,754 -- 00:55:27,450 the host had a nervous breakdown. 1068 00:55:29,826 -- 00:55:32,124 FRANCO: As Charles and Ray's reputation 1069 00:55:32,195 -- 00:55:33,822 as visual communicators grew, 1070 00:55:33,897 -- 00:55:36,559 so did their list of corporate clients. 1071 00:55:36,633 -- 00:55:37,691 MAN: N is

Alcoa 1081 00:56:22,912 -- 00:56:24,174 to show off the uses of aluminum, 1082 00:56:24,247 -- 00:56:27,410 they built a solar-powered Do-Nothing Machine, 1083 00:56:27,484 -- 00:56:30,681 which did exactly that. 1084 00:56:30,754 -- 00:56:33,746 SUSSMAN: That was in the golden years, 1085 00:56:33,823 -- 00:56:36,849 when the heads of corporations would speak, 1086 00:56:36,926 -- 00:56:39,486 a chair away from the designer. 1087 00:56:39,562 -- 00:56:42,224 So that if you needed to talk to somebody, 1088 00:56:42,298 -- 00:56:44,391 you talked to the decision maker. 1089 00:56:44,467 -- 00:56:48,870 You didn't talk to a manager who talked to a director 1090 00:56:48,938 -- 00:56:50,565 who talked to a chief director 1091 00:56:50,640 -- 00:56:52,301 who talked to a vice president 1092 00:56:52,375 -- 00:56:54,138 who talked to a senior vice president 1093 00:56:54,210 -- 00:56:56,235 who talked to an executive vice president 1094 00:56:56,312 -- 00:56:58,803 who was allowed to talk to God. 1095 00:56:58,882 -- 00:57:03,251 SELIGSOHN: Almost never was there a dissenting voice. 1096 00:57:03,319 -- 00:57:06,117 We trusted his decision making entirely. 1097 00:57:06,189 -- 00:57:09,249 So his freedom to do and to explain 1098 00:57:09,325 -- 00:57:10,952 and to conceive and execute 1099 00:57:11,027 -- 00:57:13,587 was almost unparalleled. 1100 00:57:13,663 -- 00:57:16,598 BEEBE: They didn't have contracts. 1101 00:57:16,666 -- 00:57:18,133 They had a handshake. 1102 00:57:18,201 -- 00:57:21,932 All those huge projects were done on a handshake. 1103 00:57:22,005 -- 00:57:24,405 "We're going to give you the best product, 1104 00:57:24,474 -- 00:57:27,409 butwe can't tell you what it's going to cost." 1105 00:57:27,477 -- 00:57:29,274 And for IBM 1106 00:57:29,345 -- 00:57:32,678 and for Polaroid, and for Herman Miller, 1107 00:57:32,749 -- 00:57:34,046 it was okay. 1108 00:57:34,117 -- 00:57:37,450 FRANCO: And for Charles, 1109 00:57:37,520 -- 00:57:40,921 these gentlemen's agreements went both ways. 1110 00:57:40,990 -- 00:57:46,587 ASHBY: The budget for "Mathematica" was $150,000. 1111 00:57:46,663 -- 00:57:50,599 It actually ended up costing $300,000, 1112 00:57:50,667 -- 00:57:54,000 and Charles paid for the $150,000 1113 00:57:54,070 -- 00:57:55,765 that itwent over budget. 1114 00:57:55,839 -- 00:57:58,239 So the whole thing about what things cost 1115 00:57:58,308 -- 00:58:00,367 and trying to keep it within the budget 1116 00:58:00,443 -- 00:58:02,172 and meet the clients, he didn't care about... 1117 00:58:02,245 -- 00:58:06,341 he cared about it, but he just, he couldn't stop himself. 1118 00:58:08,751 -- 00:58:12,414 FRANCO: Charles and Ray's career began with a utopian notion 1119 00:58:12,489 -- 00:58:15,890 of providing low-cost, high-quality goods to the masses 1120 00:58:15,959 -- 00:58:17,927 through industrial production. 1121 00:58:17,994 -- 00:58:19,962 But they never viewed their work 1122 00:58:20,029 -- 00:58:22,463 for corporate titans as selling out. 1123 00:58:22,532 -- 00:58:25,399 ALBRECHT: They wanted to work for the Google of their time, 1124 00:58:25,468 -- 00:58:28,631 and they did, and it allowed them incredible experimentation. 1125 00:58:28,705 -- 00:58:31,003 And they believed they could have a bigger impact 1126 00:58:31,074 -- 00:58:34,168 on everyday life by working for the bigger company. 1127 00:58:43,987 -- 00:58:46,353 FRANCO: IBM shared Charles's concern 1128 00:58:46,422 -- 00:58:50,688 that American kids were falling behind in math and science. 1129 00:58:50,760 -- 00:58:53,490 And as usual, they gave the Office free rein 1130 00:58:53,563 -- 00:58:54,996 to address the problem. 1131 00:58:55,064 -- 00:58:57,259 Maybe, Charles felt, 1132 00:58:57,333 -- 00:58:59,198 a film could help. 1133 00:58:59,269 -- 00:59:02,204 NARRATOR: We begin with a scene one meter wide, 1134 00:59:02,272 -- 00:59:04,240 which we view from just one meter away. 1135 00:59:04,307 -- 00:59:06,639 Now, every ten seconds, we will look 1136 00:59:06,709 -- 00:59:08,370 from ten times farther away, 1137 00:59:08,444 -- 00:59:11,277 and our field of view will be ten times wider. 1138 00:59:11,347 -- 00:59:13,907 FRANCO: "Powers of Ten" would become the best known 1139 00:59:13,983 -- 00:59:18,249 of all the Eames films, viewed in countless classrooms 1140 00:59:18,321 -- 00:59:21,620 and copied freely by filmmakers around the world. 1141 00:59:21,691 -- 00:59:24,683 SCHRADER: Everyone has seen "Powers of Ten." 1142 00:59:24,761 -- 00:59:27,059 They may not have seen the version Charles did, 1143 00:59:27,130 -- 00:59:28,392 but they have seen 1144 00:59:28,464 -- 00:59:31,365 one of the countless rip-offs ofthat film. 1145 00:59:31,434 -- 00:59:34,597 NARRATOR: Ten to the sixth, a one with six zeros, 1146 00:59:34,671 -- 00:59:37,401 a million meters... soon the earth will show 1147 00:59:37,473 -- 00:59:38,633 as a solid sphere. 1148 00:59:38,708 -- 00:59:42,075 TONDREAU: Nobody had done a movie like that. 1149 00:59:42,145 -- 00:59:45,911 How can you fail, doing a cosmic zoom 1150 00:59:45,982 -- 00:59:48,644 in and out from all that is? 1151 00:59:48,718 -- 00:59:51,152 And so the concept is, all by itself, mind-blowing. 1152 00:59:51,220 -- 00:59:53,518 NARRATOR: The trip back to the picnic on the lakefront 1153 00:59:53,590 -- 00:59:56,388 will be a sped-up version, reducing the distance 1154 00:59:56,459 -- 00:59:59,895 to the Earth's surface by one power of ten every two seconds. 1155 00:59:59,963 -- 01:00:02,022 It's "Ch-ch-ch-ch-shoo," 1156 01:00:02,098 -- 01:00:04,623 excessive information, dizzying information. 1157 01:00:04,701 -- 01:00:07,135 NARRATOR: Ten to the ninth meters, 1158 01:00:07,203 -- 01:00:09,330 ten to the eighth... 1159 01:00:09,405 -- 01:00:12,169 SCHRADER: Like in a chase sequence in a movie, 1160 01:00:12,241 -- 01:00:14,232 everything is going by so fast, 1161 01:00:14,310 -- 01:00:16,778 it forces the observer to choose the information 1162 01:00:16,846 -- 01:00:17,835 that's truly important, 1163 01:00:17,914 -- 01:00:19,438 which is the car or the person 1164 01:00:19,515 -- 01:00:20,709 that is running away from you... 1165 01:00:20,783 -- 01:00:22,250 i.e., the idea. 1166 01:00:22,318 -- 01:00:25,310 NARRATOR: One. We are back a tour starting point. 1167 01:00:25,388 -- 01:00:27,379 SCHRADER: Eames was aware that, in fact, 1168 01:00:27,457 -- 01:00:28,947 that this was somewhat dizzying, 1169 01:00:29,025 -- 01:00:30,287 and that it wasn't possible 1170 01:00:30,360 -- 01:00:32,191 to get all of this information across 1171 01:00:32,261 -- 01:00:34,593 in a single viewing, and that was fine. 1172 01:00:34,664 -- 01:00:37,326 What he probably didn't know 1173 01:00:37,400 -- 01:00:40,631 was that he was also looking into the future 1174 01:00:40,703 -- 01:00:42,603 of audio-visual perception. 1175 01:00:42,672 -- 01:00:45,732 The pace at which we receive information today 1176 01:00:45,808 -- 01:00:51,678 is as fast as he was doing back then. 1177 01:00:51,748 -- 01:00:55,343 NARRATOR: As a single proton fills our scene, 1178 01:00:55,418 -- 01:00:57,613 we reach the edge of present understanding. 1179 01:00:57,687 -- 01:01:00,884 SUSSMAN: As time went on, 1180 01:01:00,957 -- 01:01:06,020 Charles became more and more and more interested in ideas, 1181 01:01:06,095 -- 01:01:08,859 especially science and mathematics. 1182 01:01:08,931 -- 01:01:14,733 Ray was less engaged. 1183 01:01:14,804 -- 01:01:20,470 I mean, I'm no mathematician, and I'm no... not an architect, 1184 01:01:20,543 -- 01:01:23,706 I'm not... I haven't had certain training, 1185 01:01:23,780 -- 01:01:30,117 so I just try to help in the way that I... in any way I can. 1186 01:01:30,186 -- 01:01:32,916 I don't stop to think whether I can. 1187 01:01:32,989 -- 01:01:35,423 I just go as far as I can. 1188 01:01:35,491 -- 01:01:38,654 And if I... 1189 01:01:38,728 -- 01:01:44,257 if I can't, I can't. 1190 01:01:44,333 -- 01:01:46,233 TONDREAU: I think Ray may have suffered 1191 01:01:46,302 -- 01:01:47,997 from a feeling of marginalization, 1192 01:01:48,071 -- 01:01:50,835 because some of those last projects 1193 01:01:50,907 -- 01:01:54,809 were heavy on ideas and not as heavy 1194 01:01:54,877 -- 01:02:00,406 on the kind of visual richness that was Ray's forte. 1195 01:02:00,483 -- 01:02:03,145 GIOVANNINl: She's no longer as instrumental 1196 01:02:03,219 -- 01:02:04,516 in the entire thing. 1197 01:02:04,587 -- 01:02:06,111 She can apply an aesthetic, 1198 01:02:06,189 -- 01:02:07,952 she can dress a set, and so on, 1199 01:02:08,024 -- 01:02:11,790 but, um, she's no longer as central. 1200 01:02:11,861 -- 01:02:16,230 FRANCO: Ray's exquisite taste, her eye for form and color, 1201 01:02:16,299 -- 01:02:18,631 made her indispensible to the Office. 1202 01:02:18,701 -- 01:02:22,000 But it could also be a terrible burden. 1203 01:02:28,111 -- 01:02:32,070 OPPEWALL: I remember peering into Ray's office 1204 01:02:32,148 -- 01:02:34,048 only once or twice, 1205 01:02:34,117 -- 01:02:37,951 because when the door opened and I looked into it, 1206 01:02:38,020 -- 01:02:44,823 I thought, "I don't ever want to look in there again, 1207 01:02:44,894 -- 01:02:48,022 because it's a little frightening." 1208 01:02:52,368 -- 01:02:55,462 ASHBY: Ray had a little room, smaller than Charles's, 1209 01:02:55,538 -- 01:02:57,665 directly across the hall from his, 1210 01:02:57,740 -- 01:03:00,573 that was just absolutely jammed 1211 01:03:00,643 -- 01:03:03,203 with all of her little pieces of paper 1212 01:03:03,279 -- 01:03:04,871 and all of her little slides 1213 01:03:04,947 -- 01:03:06,244 and all of the little notes 1214 01:03:06,315 -- 01:03:08,112 that people had mailed to her 1215 01:03:08,184 -- 01:03:10,618 and that she was mailing to them. 1216 01:03:10,686 -- 01:03:12,711 BEEBE: And she would go in and find things. 1217 01:03:12,789 -- 01:03:14,017 She would say, "Oh, I have one," 1218 01:03:14,090 -- 01:03:15,819 and she would disappear into the room 1219 01:03:15,892 -- 01:03:18,520 and come out with the perfect kite. 1220 01:03:18,594 -- 01:03:22,462 Or she'd go in and find the perfect scarf or something. 1221 01:03:22,532 -- 01:03:25,057 She would go, and she would fuss with it, 1222 01:03:25,134 -- 01:03:27,295 and change it one day, 1223 01:03:27,370 -- 01:03:29,361 and the next day, she would look at it again 1224 01:03:29,438 -- 01:03:31,065 and change a little something else. 1225 01:03:31,140 -- 01:03:33,768 And I think over the years, 1226 01:03:33,843 -- 01:03:37,176 the perfectionism did get in the way. 1227 01:03:37,246 -- 01:03:40,306 In a way, it crippled her. 1228 01:03:40,383 -- 01:03:44,376 WOMAN: Here is oh, a picnic basket, a drawing of a basket. 1229 01:03:44,453 -- 01:03:46,284 Up in Seaview Village, 1230 01:03:46,355 -- 01:03:47,845 so probably Deborah Sussman. 1231 01:03:47,924 -- 01:03:51,451 It's a letter from Lily Saarinen. 1232 01:03:51,527 -- 01:03:52,653 That's cool. 1233 01:03:52,728 -- 01:03:54,059 Look at that, I've never seen that. 1234 01:03:54,130 -- 01:03:55,154 There we go... 1235 01:03:55,231 -- 01:03:58,496 "Dearest Queen of all Pack Rats." 1236 01:03:58,568 -- 01:04:01,332 I think it was almost a nervous tic with her. 1237 01:04:01,404 -- 01:04:03,497 She was constantly making notes, 1238 01:04:03,573 -- 01:04:06,872 and usually on the back of Benson & Hedges wrappers. 1239 01:04:06,943 -- 01:04:08,934 This is one of the wrappers, 1240 01:04:09,011 -- 01:04:10,569 and on this side 1241 01:04:10,646 -- 01:04:12,671 she designed something that looks very reminiscent 1242 01:04:12,748 -- 01:04:15,216 of some of her fabric designs. 1243 01:04:15,284 -- 01:04:17,752 And you turn it over, and you see it's a Benson & Hedges. 1244 01:04:17,820 -- 01:04:20,618 And on this side are notes she made 1245 01:04:20,690 -- 01:04:24,353 for lighting of the puppet shows 1246 01:04:24,427 -- 01:04:26,224 at the IBM pavilion. 1247 01:04:26,295 -- 01:04:28,729 CAPLAN: You'd find them everywhere. 1248 01:04:28,798 -- 01:04:30,322 They'd drive you crazy. 1249 01:04:30,399 -- 01:04:33,061 And they could say, "Buy soap," 1250 01:04:33,135 -- 01:04:35,069 or "Liver and onions for dinner," 1251 01:04:35,137 -- 01:04:38,129 or they'd have very elaborate ideas. 1252 01:04:38,207 -- 01:04:40,437 MARILYN NEUHART: She had her suits made, 1253 01:04:40,509 -- 01:04:43,501 and they had pockets that went all the way to the hem. 1254 01:04:43,579 -- 01:04:45,012 So whatever she wanted to keep, 1255 01:04:45,081 -- 01:04:46,912 she would just shove in the pockets. 1256 01:04:46,983 -- 01:04:50,009 MAN: So what would happen with these notes? 1257 01:04:50,086 -- 01:04:51,883 McALEER: Well, for a time, she asked the staff 1258 01:04:51,954 -- 01:04:54,047 to try to type them up, and I think it became 1259 01:04:54,123 -- 01:04:56,182 too overwhelming for the staff. 1260 01:04:56,259 -- 01:04:58,659 It was such an avalanche of notes. 1261 01:04:58,728 -- 01:05:02,528 TONDREAU: Ray didn't communicate like everybody else does. 1262 01:05:02,598 -- 01:05:04,725 She expected that you 1263 01:05:04,800 -- 01:05:07,462 pre-understood what she was talking about. 1264 01:05:07,536 -- 01:05:10,334 The people who didn't make the effort 1265 01:05:10,406 -- 01:05:13,375 would sometimes use the epithet "Crazy Rayzy," 1266 01:05:13,442 -- 01:05:16,036 simply because they didn't understand her. 1267 01:05:16,112 -- 01:05:19,809 But Ray is not crazy. She's brilliant. 1268 01:05:19,882 -- 01:05:22,476 BEEBE: And Ray had a lot of competition 1269 01:05:22,551 -- 01:05:24,109 forCharles's attention, 1270 01:05:24,186 -- 01:05:30,887 which I don't think anybody ever really gave her credit for. 1271 01:05:30,960 -- 01:05:35,090 That everybody wanted Charles and not Ray. 1272 01:05:37,166 -- 01:05:41,500 OPPEWALL: He was the guy that the IBM executives would call. 1273 01:05:41,570 -- 01:05:44,095 He was the guy that you went to 1274 01:05:44,173 -- 01:05:46,232 to discuss the projects intellectually. 1275 01:05:46,309 -- 01:05:50,439 He was very charismatic. 1276 01:05:50,513 -- 01:05:53,209 Charles was extremely charismatic. 1277 01:05:53,282 -- 01:05:54,476 He was very charismatic. 1278 01:05:54,550 -- 01:05:55,642 He was very handsome. 1279 01:05:55,718 -- 01:05:59,017 He was very handsome and very charismatic. 1280 01:05:59,088 -- 01:06:01,682 I know that word is really overused, but he was. 1281 01:06:01,757 -- 01:06:04,988 And especially very charismatic to women. 1282 01:06:10,132 -- 01:06:11,963 BLAICH: He reminded me of Henry Fonda, 1283 01:06:12,034 -- 01:06:16,266 and I met Henry Fonda one time, and I told Henry Fonda this, 1284 01:06:16,339 -- 01:06:17,601 that I thought they looked alike, 1285 01:06:17,673 -- 01:06:19,300 and he said, "That's a compliment." 1286 01:06:19,375 -- 01:06:22,674 SUSSMAN: I mean, he had these dimples, 1287 01:06:22,745 -- 01:06:24,872 and he..."Aw, shucks," kind of guy. 1288 01:06:27,116 -- 01:06:30,483 SCHRADER: He was handsome and smart, and cool. 1289 01:06:30,553 -- 01:06:33,021 So, you know, that's a kind of lethal combination. 1290 01:06:33,089 -- 01:06:35,284 WECHSLER: It was the vision. 1291 01:06:35,358 -- 01:06:37,223 It was the personality. 1292 01:06:37,293 -- 01:06:38,726 It was the charm. 1293 01:06:38,794 -- 01:06:40,694 It was the unexpected. 1294 01:06:40,763 -- 01:06:41,889 It was the person. 1295 01:06:41,964 -- 01:06:45,730 This is just a small selection 1296 01:06:45,801 -- 01:06:47,792 of letters that I went through 1297 01:06:47,870 -- 01:06:52,705 to find things that pertain particularly to the work. 1298 01:06:52,775 -- 01:06:56,871 "In the next few weeks, I must pull together a preliminary film 1299 01:06:56,946 -- 01:06:59,710 for the 'Franklin and Jefferson' show." 1300 01:07:04,153 -- 01:07:07,213 And then the rest is personal. 1301 01:07:12,728 -- 01:07:16,425 BEEBE: I think their marriage, 1302 01:07:16,499 -- 01:07:21,801 it was a mystery to everybody, in a way. 1303 01:07:21,871 -- 01:07:26,171 They were emotionally extremely bonded. 1304 01:07:26,242 -- 01:07:32,943 But he found excitement and thrills outside of Ray, 1305 01:07:33,015 -- 01:07:35,813 and outside of the Office, 1306 01:07:35,885 -- 01:07:40,948 which was really crushing to her. 1307 01:07:44,794 -- 01:07:47,524 WECHSLER: I met him when he was on the visiting committee 1308 01:07:47,596 -- 01:07:49,826 forthe architecture department at M.I.T. 1309 01:07:49,899 -- 01:07:52,959 And I was a young assistant professor. 1310 01:07:53,035 -- 01:07:55,731 Charles said, "Let's experiment 1311 01:07:55,805 -- 01:07:58,273 with some films on art." 1312 01:08:02,111 -- 01:08:07,174 I have many, many letters, extraordinary letters. 1313 01:08:07,249 -- 01:08:09,774 Because we didn't live in the same city, 1314 01:08:09,852 -- 01:08:13,185 we tried to see each other as we could. 1315 01:08:13,255 -- 01:08:15,519 He had come to London, 1316 01:08:15,591 -- 01:08:18,958 and I was there, and I could not get away. 1317 01:08:19,028 -- 01:08:21,360 And he said, "I will come and stand in front of the house 1318 01:08:21,430 -- 01:08:24,661 at a certain time," and I slipped out of this 1319 01:08:24,733 -- 01:08:26,758 rather formal dinner, 1320 01:08:26,836 -- 01:08:30,567 and there he was, and we just looked at each other. 1321 01:08:37,179 -- 01:08:41,673 We had a very profound love for each other. 1322 01:08:44,954 -- 01:08:49,323 He wanted very much for us to get married 1323 01:08:49,391 -- 01:08:52,690 and to have a child, 1324 01:08:52,761 -- 01:08:54,854 and to close... he wanted to close 1325 01:08:54,930 -- 01:08:56,454 the Eames Office in Venice, 1326 01:08:56,532 -- 01:08:58,397 which he found very burdensome, 1327 01:08:58,467 -- 01:09:01,959 and for us to open an office together in New York. 1328 01:09:06,742 -- 01:09:09,404 And I made a decision... 1329 01:09:09,478 -- 01:09:11,378 and I don't know if was the right decision... 1330 01:09:11,447 -- 01:09:13,881 that I couldn't do it to Ray. 1331 01:09:13,949 -- 01:09:15,883 Because I had a friendship with her, 1332 01:09:15,951 -- 01:09:18,749 but above all because they had been together so long, 1333 01:09:18,821 -- 01:09:22,951 and I knew how much she depended on him. 1334 01:09:23,025 -- 01:09:26,392 And I said, "I can't do it." 1335 01:09:31,400 -- 01:09:35,097 BEEBE: Ray dealt with it very privately. 1336 01:09:35,171 -- 01:09:38,265 She was hurt deeply, 1337 01:09:38,340 -- 01:09:41,173 but she wasn't the kind of person 1338 01:09:41,243 -- 01:09:44,770 who would have said, "It's me or her." 1339 01:09:44,847 -- 01:09:49,682 OPPEWALL: I don't think she wanted to leave. 1340 01:09:49,752 -- 01:09:54,849 I think itwas something that she had to accept. 1341 01:09:54,924 -- 01:09:56,619 This wasn't the era 1342 01:09:56,692 -- 01:09:59,923 of easy-come, easy-go relationships. 1343 01:09:59,995 -- 01:10:04,932 There was too much shared life and community, 1344 01:10:05,000 -- 01:10:08,265 and the fact that he, you know, 1345 01:10:08,337 -- 01:10:11,773 had other relationships outside of the Office... 1346 01:10:14,043 -- 01:10:17,137 he seemed to be constructed that way. 1347 01:10:17,213 -- 01:10:21,775 KIRKHAM: But there is a position that I think is nonsense, 1348 01:10:21,850 -- 01:10:24,978 which is to say that because Charles was having 1349 01:10:25,054 -- 01:10:27,614 a relationship with somebody else 1350 01:10:27,690 -- 01:10:30,250 that he couldn't then carry on a collaboration with Ray. 1351 01:10:30,326 -- 01:10:32,191 I mean, that clearly didn't happen. 1352 01:10:34,930 -- 01:10:38,127 FRANCO: In fact, Charles and Ray were about to collaborate 1353 01:10:38,200 -- 01:10:40,259 on the largest, most complex project 1354 01:10:40,336 -- 01:10:43,032 the Office would ever undertake. 1355 01:10:44,707 -- 01:10:48,336 Forthe nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, 1356 01:10:48,410 -- 01:10:50,605 the Eames Office designed 1357 01:10:50,679 -- 01:10:52,874 "The World of Franklin and Jefferson," 1358 01:10:52,948 -- 01:10:55,849 a traveling show made up of three films, 1359 01:10:55,918 -- 01:10:59,877 40,000 words translated into four languages, 1360 01:10:59,955 -- 01:11:03,015 and thousands of photographs and objects, 1361 01:11:03,092 -- 01:11:06,892 including a stuffed bison. 1362 01:11:06,962 -- 01:11:10,261 When "Franklin and Jefferson" opened in Paris, 1363 01:11:10,332 -- 01:11:13,859 it was seen by 50,000 people in two months. 1364 01:11:13,936 -- 01:11:17,337 More than a thousand visitors saw it each day 1365 01:11:17,406 -- 01:11:19,135 in London and Warsaw. 1366 01:11:19,208 -- 01:11:21,142 But when it came to New York, 1367 01:11:21,210 -- 01:11:24,771 the reception was different. 1368 01:11:24,847 -- 01:11:28,442 ALBRECHT: When it appeared at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1369 01:11:28,517 -- 01:11:32,044 iThe New York Times/i reviewed it, and the headline was, 1370 01:11:32,121 -- 01:11:36,319 "What Is This Stuff Doing at the Met?" 1371 01:11:36,392 -- 01:11:37,484 Ltwas one of the first times 1372 01:11:37,559 -- 01:11:39,823 the Eameses were ever criticized. 1373 01:11:42,298 -- 01:11:44,323 It had an enormous amount of text. 1374 01:11:44,400 -- 01:11:47,494 Nobody could have possibly read it all, it was so dense. 1375 01:11:50,339 -- 01:11:52,500 WURMAN: This show was a bit picky for me, 1376 01:11:52,574 -- 01:11:54,542 too many little objects that I would remember none. 1377 01:11:54,610 -- 01:11:56,043 It was too many things to see. 1378 01:11:56,111 -- 01:11:57,578 I can remember about ten things. 1379 01:11:59,281 -- 01:12:02,148 He knew so much about all these things, 1380 01:12:02,217 -- 01:12:05,152 he couldn't edit out something. 1381 01:12:05,220 -- 01:12:08,212 These are things of the period 1382 01:12:08,290 -- 01:12:10,383 and of the time, from Mount Vernon. 1383 01:12:10,459 -- 01:12:13,587 WURMAN: They were all so interesting to him, 1384 01:12:13,662 -- 01:12:15,425 and he was familiar with them, 1385 01:12:15,497 -- 01:12:17,465 and he could see all these connections. 1386 01:12:17,533 -- 01:12:19,797 But you can't keep it all in your head 1387 01:12:19,868 -- 01:12:21,301 if you're not that familiarwith it. 1388 01:12:23,939 -- 01:12:26,737 OPPEWALL: You could call itclutter, butthat's not 1389 01:12:26,809 -- 01:12:28,208 what Charles would have called it, 1390 01:12:28,277 -- 01:12:30,939 because clutter is just stuff that's 1391 01:12:31,013 -- 01:12:34,710 dropped and abandoned and forgotten and leftthere. 1392 01:12:34,783 -- 01:12:36,250 It was dense, 1393 01:12:36,318 -- 01:12:38,309 and it was complex, 1394 01:12:38,387 -- 01:12:40,981 but there was a mind at work 1395 01:12:41,056 -- 01:12:42,455 placing it there. 1396 01:12:42,524 -- 01:12:45,550 Whether you as the recipient 1397 01:12:45,627 -- 01:12:48,619 were willing and able to accept that is another question. 1398 01:12:50,899 -- 01:12:52,764 ALBRECHT: They're pushing up against the envelope 1399 01:12:52,835 -- 01:12:54,632 of what technology could do, 1400 01:12:54,703 -- 01:12:57,729 because they're trying to give the visitor 1401 01:12:57,806 -- 01:13:00,969 a hypertext experience, 1402 01:13:01,043 -- 01:13:03,671 but they're doing it in physical space. 1403 01:13:03,746 -- 01:13:05,077 And it doesn't work. 1404 01:13:05,147 -- 01:13:08,514 They are anticipating 1405 01:13:08,584 -- 01:13:10,211 what the computer can do today very easily 1406 01:13:10,285 -- 01:13:13,686 with layering text and giving you at different levels. 1407 01:13:13,756 -- 01:13:17,487 So it's a failure, but it's an honest failure. 1408 01:13:21,630 -- 01:13:24,360 The criticism of "Franklin and Jefferson" 1409 01:13:24,433 -- 01:13:26,196 hit Charles hard. 1410 01:13:26,268 -- 01:13:29,169 DEMETRIOS: The "Franklin and Jefferson" show 1411 01:13:29,238 -- 01:13:31,138 was an exhausting show 1412 01:13:31,206 -- 01:13:32,969 because it was huge, 1413 01:13:33,041 -- 01:13:36,875 and I think sort of the machinery of doing that 1414 01:13:36,945 -- 01:13:39,140 was just tiring. 1415 01:13:39,214 -- 01:13:40,282 TONDREAU: I saw Charles at his happiest 1416 01:13:40,282 -- 01:13:42,944 TONDREAU: I saw Charles at his happiest 1417 01:13:43,018 -- 01:13:45,509 when he was getting to do a lot of photography. 1418 01:13:45,587 -- 01:13:49,387 And he was very engaged directly on the creative process 1419 01:13:49,458 -- 01:13:50,891 of doing the photographs... 1420 01:13:50,959 -- 01:13:54,156 which led me to the idea that maybe he felt 1421 01:13:54,229 -- 01:13:56,891 he was missing something, you know, 1422 01:13:56,965 -- 01:13:58,592 because he had had the transition 1423 01:13:58,667 -- 01:14:01,534 to more of an executive position at the Office. 1424 01:14:01,603 -- 01:14:05,266 BEEBE: It was very hard for him, because he didn't really have 1425 01:14:05,340 -- 01:14:07,467 a successor, 1426 01:14:07,543 -- 01:14:11,309 and for the years that I was there, he was always 1427 01:14:11,380 -- 01:14:13,575 looking for the perfect person. 1428 01:14:13,649 -- 01:14:15,810 It was a battle one day 1429 01:14:15,884 -- 01:14:19,980 with the IBM representative, Mike Sullivan, 1430 01:14:20,055 -- 01:14:22,956 and Mike said, "Why don't you shut this down?" 1431 01:14:23,025 -- 01:14:24,322 And he said, "I'd like to." 1432 01:14:24,393 -- 01:14:26,122 And Sullivan said, "What would you do?" 1433 01:14:26,195 -- 01:14:30,825 And he said, "I'd just travel and shoot." 1434 01:14:30,899 -- 01:14:34,460 "But," he said, "I don't know what to do about Ray, 1435 01:14:34,536 -- 01:14:37,130 and closing the Office." 1436 01:14:37,206 -- 01:14:40,175 BEEBE: He was tired, and he was, 1437 01:14:40,242 -- 01:14:42,676 I don't know if it was his heart, but he was cold a lot. 1438 01:14:42,744 -- 01:14:45,406 I brought him one morning... it was a Saturday morning, 1439 01:14:45,481 -- 01:14:47,278 and I'd made applesauce cake or something, 1440 01:14:47,349 -- 01:14:48,839 and I brought it to the office, 1441 01:14:48,917 -- 01:14:51,579 and I handed it to Charles wrapped in tin foil, 1442 01:14:51,653 -- 01:14:54,144 and it was still warm, and he took it, 1443 01:14:54,223 -- 01:14:55,713 pressed it to his chest, 1444 01:14:55,791 -- 01:14:57,588 and he was thrilled to have that warmth 1445 01:14:57,659 -- 01:15:00,321 just sort of on his chest. 1446 01:15:15,944 -- 01:15:20,643 JOHN NEUHART: I was out of the office the day that he died. 1447 01:15:20,716 -- 01:15:25,449 It was, in a way, it was expected. 1448 01:15:28,223 -- 01:15:31,488 SUSSMAN: It just didn't seem possible. 1449 01:15:31,560 -- 01:15:34,324 I mean, I knew that some people that Charles worked with, 1450 01:15:34,396 -- 01:15:36,990 men in the East, wept. 1451 01:15:39,568 -- 01:15:47,668 He was such a dominant force in the lives of designers that... 1452 01:15:49,444 -- 01:15:54,143 it was like there was suddenly a big empty hole. 1453 01:15:58,654 -- 01:16:00,679 OPPEWALL: There are still days 1454 01:16:00,756 -- 01:16:03,190 when I'm driving down the highway, 1455 01:16:03,258 -- 01:16:06,523 thinking about things, and I think, 1456 01:16:06,595 -- 01:16:09,086 "Why did you die? 1457 01:16:09,164 -- 01:16:12,258 I'm not through with you yet! 1458 01:16:12,334 -- 01:16:16,964 I haven't finished asking you the questions I wanted to ask." 1459 01:16:23,612 -- 01:16:27,946 He was the most important person in my life. 1460 01:16:30,052 -- 01:16:33,749 I mean, he could be, he could really be tough, you know, 1461 01:16:33,822 -- 01:16:36,290 but he... 1462 01:16:39,828 -- 01:16:42,262 he was an extraordinary person. 1463 01:16:49,571 -- 01:16:52,563 BEEBE: After Charles died, 1464 01:16:52,641 -- 01:16:54,268 suddenly Ray was 1465 01:16:54,343 -- 01:16:56,106 the head of the Office. 1466 01:16:58,680 -- 01:17:00,648 She gathered everybody around, 1467 01:17:00,716 -- 01:17:04,345 and she talked about her goals and what she wanted to do, 1468 01:17:04,419 -- 01:17:07,855 and how she needed our help. 1469 01:17:07,923 -- 01:17:10,915 And it was really very powerful, 1470 01:17:10,993 -- 01:17:12,790 because she had never done that before. 1471 01:17:12,861 -- 01:17:17,321 But she felt this huge burden about carrying on the name 1472 01:17:17,399 -- 01:17:19,162 and carrying on the Office. 1473 01:17:19,234 -- 01:17:23,193 And I think it was killing her. 1474 01:17:23,271 -- 01:17:25,535 And I said, "Come on, Ray, why don't you 1475 01:17:25,607 -- 01:17:28,633 just close the Office, and let's go and paint." 1476 01:17:28,710 -- 01:17:31,110 And she said "No, that's all in the past. 1477 01:17:31,179 -- 01:17:33,044 I can't do that anymore." 1478 01:17:36,618 -- 01:17:38,017 FRANCO: Without Charles, 1479 01:17:38,086 -- 01:17:41,419 activity in the Eames Office dwindled, 1480 01:17:41,490 -- 01:17:44,857 until itwas time to finally close 901. 1481 01:17:47,596 -- 01:17:49,860 Ray focused on the painstaking work 1482 01:17:49,931 -- 01:17:52,923 of cataloguing the voluminous 40-year output 1483 01:17:53,001 -- 01:17:56,095 of the Eames Office. 1484 01:17:56,171 -- 01:17:59,732 Nearly 350,000 photographs 1485 01:17:59,808 -- 01:18:02,299 and half a million documents had to be organized for shipment 1486 01:18:02,377 -- 01:18:05,676 to the Library of Congress. 1487 01:18:09,251 -- 01:18:12,118 But over the years, a new generation 1488 01:18:12,187 -- 01:18:14,849 lifted Ray from Charles's shadow, 1489 01:18:14,923 -- 01:18:17,983 discovering in her exuberant design sense 1490 01:18:18,060 -- 01:18:21,791 a refreshing alternative to the austerity of modernism. 1491 01:18:24,066 -- 01:18:26,830 And Ray seemed to finally find her voice 1492 01:18:26,902 -- 01:18:32,033 as one of the most influential women of American design. 1493 01:18:32,107 -- 01:18:34,871 Best for the most for the least, 1494 01:18:34,943 -- 01:18:36,934 that was always the principle. 1495 01:18:37,012 -- 01:18:38,946 That's why we became interested 1496 01:18:39,014 -- 01:18:40,276 in mass production. 1497 01:18:40,348 -- 01:18:44,250 SUSSMAN: At that point, 1498 01:18:44,319 -- 01:18:47,254 women began to point to Ray. 1499 01:18:47,322 -- 01:18:48,812 You know, "If there are two Eameses, 1500 01:18:48,890 -- 01:18:50,357 why aren't they both credited?" 1501 01:18:50,425 -- 01:18:51,722 And now, of course, they are. 1502 01:19:10,879 -- 01:19:15,816 BEEBE: She kept saying, in the hospital, "What day is it?" 1503 01:19:15,884 -- 01:19:19,843 And I would say, "It's Wednesday the 18th." 1504 01:19:19,921 -- 01:19:21,946 And she would say, "Oh." 1505 01:19:22,023 -- 01:19:23,456 And then the next time I would come, 1506 01:19:23,525 -- 01:19:25,857 then she would say, "What day is it?" 1507 01:19:25,927 -- 01:19:27,019 "It's Thursday." 1508 01:19:27,095 -- 01:19:28,426 "Oh." 1509 01:19:33,401 -- 01:19:37,269 I think she wanted to die on the same day as Charles 1510 01:19:37,339 -- 01:19:41,708 because it sort of symbolized their being one. 1511 01:19:46,248 -- 01:19:52,710 Her last statement was one of being with Charles. 1512 01:20:10,005 -- 01:20:14,704 This guy and that guy could trade places. 1513 01:20:14,776 -- 01:20:17,370 There's probably an Eames chair 1514 01:20:17,445 -- 01:20:20,073 literally in every single issue that we've published. 1515 01:20:20,148 -- 01:20:21,172 You know, you could go 1516 01:20:21,249 -- 01:20:23,080 from the DAX to the DSS to the LCW, 1517 01:20:23,151 -- 01:20:24,982 you know, you'll get this whole range. 1518 01:20:25,053 -- 01:20:26,850 MAN: Clockwise just a little. 1519 01:20:26,922 -- 01:20:27,911 Just a little. 1520 01:20:27,989 -- 01:20:31,618 The furniture still has a quality 1521 01:20:31,693 -- 01:20:32,955 that every young designer 1522 01:20:33,028 -- 01:20:34,962 is searching for, because of the amount of thought 1523 01:20:35,030 -- 01:20:36,725 that's been put into it 1524 01:20:36,798 -- 01:20:40,928 by everyone whose hands touch the project. 1525 01:20:41,002 -- 01:20:44,062 I think you see that optimism of the American spirit 1526 01:20:44,139 -- 01:20:46,369 in their design. 1527 01:20:46,441 -- 01:20:48,170 It provided just a great blueprint 1528 01:20:48,243 -- 01:20:49,938 for how we could live our lives. 1529 01:20:52,347 -- 01:20:54,110 PEATROSS: What furniture designers 1530 01:20:54,182 -- 01:20:57,117 ever have produced 40 to 50 pieces of furniture 1531 01:20:57,185 -- 01:21:00,621 that have been in production for five decades? 1532 01:21:00,689 -- 01:21:03,988 But the other thing is the sheer joy, 1533 01:21:04,059 -- 01:21:05,924 that aspect of play. 1534 01:21:05,994 -- 01:21:09,589 No one else, I think, had that combination 1535 01:21:09,664 -- 01:21:12,599 of the pragmatic and the aesthetic. 1536 01:21:12,667 -- 01:21:14,828 NARRATOR: Seven... 1537 01:21:14,903 -- 01:21:17,872 SUSSMAN: They loved to say, "We don't do art. 1538 01:21:17,939 -- 01:21:19,964 We solve problems." 1539 01:21:20,041 -- 01:21:21,099 It's the process. 1540 01:21:21,176 -- 01:21:22,837 It's, how do we get from where we are 1541 01:21:22,911 -- 01:21:25,573 to where we want to be? 1542 01:21:25,647 -- 01:21:27,205 NARRATOR: Grasp the rear of the viewfinder... 1543 01:21:27,282 -- 01:21:29,807 DEMETRIOS: Charles and Ray were always looking to the future. 1544 01:21:29,885 -- 01:21:31,375 They weren't sort of sitting around, 1545 01:21:31,453 -- 01:21:33,353 telling war stories about organic furniture. 1546 01:21:33,421 -- 01:21:34,649 What they were doing is like, 1547 01:21:34,723 -- 01:21:36,884 "What's the next thing?" 1548 01:21:36,958 -- 01:21:39,927 ALBRECHT: They were there 1549 01:21:39,995 -- 01:21:42,020 for the major moments in American history, 1550 01:21:42,097 -- 01:21:44,497 and they were really the pioneers of the information age. 1551 01:21:44,566 -- 01:21:47,364 NARRATOR: The visitor can try out the computer 1552 01:21:47,435 -- 01:21:49,096 as a carrier of information. 1553 01:21:49,170 -- 01:21:51,798 ALBRECHT: The breadth of the work is extraordinary, 1554 01:21:51,873 -- 01:21:55,775 but there is also a unifying theme of beauty 1555 01:21:55,844 -- 01:21:59,075 and a desire to reach a broad audience. 1556 01:21:59,147 -- 01:22:01,877 So if it was pulled forward a little bit? 1557 01:22:01,950 -- 01:22:04,475 Every designer owes them some amount of debt, 1558 01:22:04,552 -- 01:22:08,488 but at the same time, part of that debt should be to kind of 1559 01:22:08,556 -- 01:22:12,856 take what they did and move beyond it.
