Just keep your eye on Togepi, okay, Pikachu? Come on, come on, come on Let's go Vacation, need a little sun I'm going to get my friends together and have a little fun Ain't nobody going to tell us what we going to do Because today it's up to me and you Temptation calling out to me A little relaxation I'll be free to be Come on and wicky-wicky lou I do believe it'll start now Kick it back to the track Vacation's where I want to be Buddy on the beach where the fun is free We don't need a holiday to start to celebrate Repeat after me: I need a vacation Let's go Vacation's where I want to be Buddy on the beach where the fun is free We don't need a holiday to start to celebrate Because I need a break, I need a vacation Vacation's where I want to be Buddy on the beach where the fun is free Pokdex observation unit now activating. My function: Monitor Pokmon activity... ...to understand behavioral patterns of the Pokmon... ...when they are in a state of total relaxation. Togepi, the Egg Pokmon. It exhibits a low tolerance for hunger. It is able to communicate this condition in a very effective manner. Pika, Pika. Pikachu. Squirt. Saur. Psy. Bulbasaur Bulba, bulba Bulbasaur This is the first known recording of ''Bulbasaur's Bulbabye. '' Bellsprout. Bellsprout. Activating Pokmon database. Snubble, a newly discovered Pokmon.

Pokmon do not battle unless directed by their trainers. Translation activated. ''Let's set a good example for the baby. '' lKarp. Togepi. Slooooooooow. Pokmon enjoy competition, but not always in Pokmon battles. It's not uncommon for Pokmon to challenge each other in contests. Oh come on, try to catch me Oh catch me if you can Oh come on, try to catch me Oh catch me if you can -Exeggutor. -Oddish. -Exeggutor. -Oddish. Pikachu and Raichu are both Mouse Pokmon of the electric variety. Combined voltage approaching shockingly dangerous levels. This is the perfect place for a comfy catnap. What's that? What's the rush? Farfetch'd, Farfetch'd.... Hitmonlee. Chansey, Chansey. lKeep it down! Mag. Magne. Ma. Magnemites! Cubone earned its classification as the Lonely Pokmon... ...from its usual attitude of caring only... ...for itself. l told you to keep quiet! Well, this ought to shut you all up, you-- Duck. l think l'll take my nap right here. Good night. Preliminary analysis: Pokmon, by nature, are friendly creatures... ...and prefer cooperation to confrontation. Final conclusion: Despite earlier uncertainties... ...Pokmon vacations are highly recommended. Pokdex observation unit now deactivating. Pikachu, it's time to leave! Goldeen! Staryu! Psyduck! Come on back! Geodude! Onix! Zubat! Vulpix! We got to go! Did you have fun? Life. The great miracle and the great mystery. Who am I? Since the beginning... ...humans and Pokmon alike have searched for its meaning. What am I? What am I? Many strange and wondrous legends evolved... ...from the pursuit of life's mysteries. Where am I? Where am I? But none is stranger than this tale... ...of the most powerful Pokmon of all. I am ready... ...to be, to be.... Where... ...am I? This is not the same. Was everything before just a dream? Why? -Doctor, look at this. -What? lts brain waves, they're surging! -Let me see! -She's right! -Let's run another scan. -lts mind is racing! Those voices. l hope we don't lose this one! They're outside. We can't! Where I must be. Tell Giovanni what's happened! Quiet! Let us hear its psychic powers. Psychic powers? For years we struggled to successfully clone a Pokmon to prove our theories. You're the first specimen to survive! That is Mew, the rarest of all Pokmon. From its DNA we created you, Mewtwo. Mewtwo? Am l only a copy? Nothing but Mew's shadow? You are greater than Mew. lmproved through the power of human ingenuity. We used the most advanced techniques to develop your psychic powers. So l am simply the end result of your experiment. What becomes of me now? Our experiment isn't over! lt's just beginning! Now the serious testing begins. These humans, they care nothing for me. Congratulations. We've done an excellent job. -We'll observe Mewtwo for mutations. -ls the new tank ready? We'll have to come up with a cage for it. Excellent. We'll start testing. Is that my purpose? Am Ijust an experiment? A laboratory specimen? This cannot be my destiny! We dreamed of creating the world's strongest Pokmon... ...and we succeeded. Behold my powers. l am the strongest Pokmon in the world. Stronger even than Mew. Those fools thought you were a science experiment... ...but l see you as a valuable partner. Partner? With your psychic powers and my resources... ...together we can control the world. l do not need your help for that, human. A wildfire destroys everything in its path. lt will be the same with your powers unless you control them. l can help you do that. How? l'll show you a way to focus your powers... ...that will make you invincible. Show me! You say this armor protects my body... ...yet it suppresses my powers! Your powers are not being suppressed. They're being focused. Learn to use them to accomplish your purpose. What is that? Patience, my friend. Your purpose will become clear. So this is my power. l am in control now. Alakazam! lKazam! But why am l here? Now l fully perceive my power. But what is my purpose? To serve your master. You were created to fight for me. That is your purpose. That cannot be. You said we were partners. We stood as equals. You were created by humans to obey humans. You could never be our equal. Humans may have created me... ...but they will never enslave me. This cannot be my destiny! Stop this now! l was not born a Pokmon! l was created. My creators have used and betrayed me. So l stand alone. Who am l? What is my true reason for being? l will find my own purpose. And purge this planet of all who oppose me. Human and Pokmon alike. The world will heed my warning. The reign of Mewtwo will soon begin. Today, Ash, Brock and Misty are taking a break from their Pokmon adventures. As always, Ash is determined to become a Pokmon master. And, as always, he's ready to endure any hardship, bear any burden... ...with strength, stamina and a will of steel. Hungry. Need food. Oh, Ash! You haven't done a thing all day! l'm too weak to work, Misty. l haven't eaten since breakfast. This lunch is going to be just perfect for you. lt's my lazy-boy ''no-chew'' stew. You there! l'm looking for a Pokmon trainer named Ash from Pallet Town. -You know him? -Yeah, he's me. Let's have a match. Unless you're afraid to lose! l'm afraid you're going to lose this one! Ash, you just said you were too weak to work! l am too weak to work, but a Pokmon battle isn't work! That's progress. At least his mouth is working. I want to be the very best Like no one ever was To catch them is my real test To train them is my cause I will travel across the land Searching far and wide Teach Pokmon to understand The power that's inside Inside Pokmon It's you and me I know it's my destiny You're my best friend And the world we must defend Our hearts are true Our courage will pull us through You teach me and I'll teach you Pokmon Got to catch them, got to catch them all Great job, Bulbasaur! You did it! You can challenge along the way Encourage our faith I will battle everything About the place Come with me, the time is right There's no better team Arm in arm we'll win the fight It's always been our dream It's you and me I know it's my destiny You are my best friend In a world we must defend A heart so true Our courage will pull us through You teach me and I'll teach you Got to catch them Got to catch them all We did it! Well, that sure was a shocking ending. Shocking that Ash moved so fast. Another credit on Pikachu's ''charge account!'' We've got to grab it! l know we must grab rare Pokmon for the Boss... ...but it wouldn't be a bad idea if we grabbed a bite to eat. We didn't come here to steal a meal! l'd settle for a taste of that Pika-chow. l'm starving. l can cook something. The last time you cooked, you wiped out eight of my nine lives. Master, shall l extend an invitation to these trainers as well? As you wish. Watch where you're flying. Something for me? Greetings, Pokmon trainers. I bear an invitation. She's really small, but really pretty! You've been chosen to join a group of Pokmon trainers at a gathering. It will be hosted by my master, the world's greatest Pokmon trainer... ...at his palace on New Island. A ferry will leave Old Shore Wharf... ...to take you to the island this afternoon. Only trainers with this invitation will be admitted. If you decide to attend, you must reply at once. My master awaits you. ls there a rewind button? -Should we go? -Of course! l've got to meet her! l guess the world's number-one trainer wants to challenge me to a match! -We've got to let him know right away. -l'm saying yes! What's so special about the twerp trio's special delivery? Hey, look! ''Yes''? To what? Raticate! Chill out, Raticate! lKingler! Save your energy! This is going to be so cool! Officer Jenny, report to the ferry entrance. Officer Jenny to the ferry entrance. Togepi's totally soaked! l can't believe how fast the storm came up. What?! The ferry is canceled?! But l've got to get to New lsland! -lt's only a little rain! -lt's more than just rain. The harbor manager thinks this could be the worst storm ever. Listen to me. The prophets have predicted the return of the Winds of Water. For years... ...l prayed mankind would never witness that deadly storm ever again. lsn't that just a legend? Ancient writings tell of the storm wiping out all but a few Pokmon. ln their sorrow... ...the water of their tears restored the lives lost in the storm. But there are no Pokmon tears today. Just waters which no one can survive. That's why the ferry has been canceled. l'm going to New lsland anyway! All my Pokmon are Water-type! We'll just swim over to that palace! l warn you, the waves will be savage! You will never make it! lf you try that stunt and your Pokmon got hurt... ...you'd be out of luck because we closed the Pokmon Center. How come? The nurse in charge of the center disappeared last month. lf any of you see her, please contact me at once. That's a picture of her over there on the wall. She's cute. She sure looks familiar. Come back here, or l'll place you under arrest! Come back! Some trainers have no fear. To them, this is just one more challenge. They follow their hearts. That is what sets them apart and will make them Pokmon masters. Good luck to all of you. The world's greatest Pokmon master is waiting for me. Let's use our Pokmon to get to that island. Our Pokmon aren't strong enough. They can't handle waves like this. Guess you're right. You vant to cross maybe? Ve take you? Ve Vikings are used to big vaves. Ve get you to New lsland faster than you can say fahrvergngen. Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! l think l'm going to have one. -l didn't know Vikings still existed. -They mostly live in Minnesota. Something's not right. Are you sure this boat's safe? Don't vorry. This ship von't let you down. Ve alvays sail in da rough veather. Don't get upset. Tell my stomach. Heave! Heave! Heave! lt's all right, Togepi. We're going to be okay. -Those aren't Vikings. -lt's Team Rocket. l knew there was something fishy about them besides the smell! -Prepare for trouble. -Make it double. Forget the motto. We're going to have to.... Ash! Misty! -Have you seen Ash and Pikachu? -Not yet. Stay together. lt's our only hope. Look! My master bids you welcome to New lsland. lKindly present your invitation. Here it is, miss. The bearers of this invitation may be admitted. l knew l recognized that face. What? Aren't you the nurse from the treatment center? You do look just like her. l fear you are mistaken. l've always dwelt on this island and been in the service of my master. Please, come this way. My master awaits your arrival. With you here, all trainers... ...worthy of an audience with my master are present. There's only three of them. Aren't we waiting for the others? Only the trainers capable of braving the storm... ...are worthy in my master's eyes. Do you mean that storm was some kind of test? Release your Pokmon from their Pokballs and join the others. lt won't be long before my master's intentions are clear. Now we'll never know what kind of party we're missing! We'll just have to crash that party. -You know another way in? -Look over there. But how are we going to swim up that thing? Pretend you're a catfish. -Something wrong, Jessie? -No. Come on. Let's get going. l think this plan's all wet. Psy-ya-ya duck. What took you guys so long? How did you get here? l decided to fly over. lt was easy. Hurricane winds are a breeze for Pidgeotto here. Guys, say hello. Those are my Pokmon. lt was no problem getting through that storm. l rode over on Gyarados' back. l heard it takes a lot of skill to train Gyarados. Yes, but once you train it, it's the most dependable Pokmon there is. You haven't met my Pokmon. Over there. You are about to meet my master. The time has come to encounter the greatest Pokmon master on Earth. What's that? Yes. The world's greatest Pokmon master... ...is also the most powerful Pokmon on Earth. This is the ruler of New lsland and soon the whole world. Mewtwo. Mewtwo. A Pokmon can't be a Pokmon master! No way! Quiet, human. From now on, l am the one who makes the rules. -How's it talking? -lt's psychic. We'll show you! Let's go, Gyarados! Gyarados, Hyper-Beam attack! Gyarados! Child's play. Your usefulness has ended. Nurse Joy! Where am l? And how in the world did l get here? You have been under my control. l transported you here from the Pokmon center. Your knowledge of Pokmon physiology proved useful to my plan. l have cleansed your tiny human brain of memories from the past weeks. Who are you?! l am the new ruler of this world... ...the master of humans and Pokmon alike. You're just a bully! Look at these. They're Pokmon. Are they real? l was hoping there'd be a party. This is the Pokmon replication system. System activated. Pokmon based on genetic analysis. Pokmon DNA sampling sequence now in progress. Put me down. What are you--? Let go! -Help! -Grab him! Help me! l made it. But just by a hair. Look, there's your hair. Analyzing Pokmon biomaterial sample. Analysis complete. Pokmon identified. Begin replication sequence. -Who's that Pokmon? -lt's Meowth. Meowth! But l'm Meowth. -So is the one in the tank. -Your clone. I haven't got much time. I pray this record of our experiment survives. A year ago we discovered... ...the remains of the ancient Pokmon, Mew. There was sufficient genetic material to replicate Mew. Giovanni insisted on super-clones... ...more powerful than any living Pokmon. Finally our experiments proved successful. We produced a living Pokmon. We called it Mewtwo. But the creature's anger is out of control. With its psychic powers, it's destroying our laboratory. We dreamed of creating the world's strongest Pokmon... ...and we succeeded. -Sounds like a real Poknstein. -Sure does. One bad cat! So this must be the lab. But if Mewtwo destroyed it.... -Somebody rebuilt it. -Yes, but who? You humans are a dangerous species. You brought me into your world with no purpose but to be your slave. But now l have my own purpose. My storm will create my own world... ...by destroying yours. So you hate all humans? And you're going to destroy us to save Pokmon. No. Your Pokmon will not be spared. They have disgraced themselves by serving humans. Those Pokmon are nothing but slaves. So, you say l am wrong? You are not this human's servant? You are his friend? You are as pathetic as the rest. Humans and Pokmon can never be friends. Are you okay? Don't pick on Pikachu. lf you are Pokmon, there's no reason l can't capture you. Go, Rhyhorn. -No! Rhyhorn! -Fools! Your Pokmon attacks cannot weaken me. My powers are too great. No trainer can conquer me. You won't mind proving it in a real match! ls that a challenge? You bet it is! They're awake! Blast. Saur. -l'm scared. -Me too. Like most Pokmon trainers... ...l too began with Charmander, Squirtle and Bulbasaur. But for their evolved forms... ...l used their genetic material to clone even more powerful copies. -Copies! -They're clones. A stadium! Mewtwo planned this all along. Your fake Venusaur can't beat my real one! Right, Bruteroot? We'll blow away that Blastoise, won't we Shellshocker?! lt may not have a nickname, but l do have a Charizard. l choose you! Charizard, l didn't say start. Your Charizard is poorly trained. Which of you will oppose me first? Saur. l underestimated you last time, but that won't happen again! Go, Bruteroot! Razor Leaf! Vine Whip. Bruteroot! lt looks like l'm up. Go, Shellshocker! Blastoise. Blast. Shellshocker, Hydro Pump! Shellshocker! You better forfeit, Ash. Those clones are too powerful. l'm not giving up. Charizard, use your speed, not power, and you'll win. All right, go! -Can't Charizard move any quicker? -The clone is too fast. -Charizard's in trouble! -Finish it. No, Charizard! No! Are you okay? As the victor, l now claim my prize: Your Pokmon. Wait! What will you do with those Pokmon?! l will extract their DNA to make clones for myself. They will remain safe on this island... ...while my storm destroys the planet. You can't do this! Yes, Mewtwo! We won't let you! Do not attempt to defy me. This is my world now. Let's go! Gyarados! l know! Mewtwo can't catch them if they're inside their Pokballs. Bulbasaur, Squirtle, return! lt's no use. lt's futile to try and escape my power. Never mind the Pokballs. Carry them away! Give back my Psyduck! Vulpix! Run, Pikachu! lKeep running, Pikachu! You're not going to get Pikachu! There goes Alakazam. Dewgong. Vileplume. Sandshrew. Nidoqueen. Vaporeon. But me, l got a special place in my tail for this one. Look there! l don't have time for your dumb motto today. Who's that Pokmon? lt's Pikachu! Let go! Stupid machine. Give me back my Pikachu! What's happening? l'm so glad you're okay. The copies are hatching! -They're fabulous fakes! -Send in the clones! But where are the real ones? -l wonder if they feel.... -Clonesome? The Pok originals! Squirtle's back! You're all okay! Humans, you have served my purpose. l am sparing your lives, for the moment. But you cannot escape your fate. The hour of my vengeance draws near. Behold! With Pokmon and humans eliminated... ...the clones shall inherit the world. You can't do this. l won't let you. -lt's Ash! -All right! -Psyduck! -Vulpix! lt is useless to challenge me. lt's not going to end like this, Mewtwo. We won't let it. You're mine! -Ash, no! -Look out! What? Can it be? -What is that? -l don't know. Mew. So finally we meet. l may have been cloned from your DNA... ...but l will prove that Mewtwo is better than the original. Superior to Mew. Mew and Mewtwo! So Mewtwo was cloned from Mew. This world is too small for two of us. Why do you flee from me? Are you afraid to find out which of us is greater? So you do have some fight in you. But l have no time for games. Destiny is at hand. Who will rule? My super Pokmon? Or your pathetic group of spineless inferior Pokmon? We were created with powers far stronger than the originals. -Mew's got a good point. -What's it saying? You don't prove anything by showing off a lot of special powers. And that a Pokmon's real strength comes from the heart. My clones don't need their powers to prove their worth. l will block all the Pokmon's special abilities... ...using my psychic powers. Now we shall see who triumphs. Go! Pokmon aren't meant to fight. Not like this. lt's useless. What can come out of it? Nothing but pain. Can't Mewtwo understand it's not right to force Pokmon to battle? They're all living creatures. This just proves that fighting is wrong. l was prepared for trouble, but not for this. Make that double for me. Now l can see how horrible fighting really is. Even the best of friends will fight sometimes. l'll promise never to fight again if you will. What am l doing? Let's get something straight! You-owth ain't pushing Meowth around. You mean, we don't have to fight with each other? But how can l trust you? You was born different. l almost made a clawful mistake. How do l know you're not going to pull a fast one on me? You're right, we do have a lot in common. The same earth, the same air, the same sky. Maybe if we started looking at what's the same... ...instead of always looking at what's different, who knows? Quit it! Please, stop! Are you okay? We got to stop this. How? Mewtwo wants to prove how strong those super-clones are. l'd rather risk my life out in Mewtwo's storm... ...than watch Pokmon destroy each other. Me too. l wish there were some way to stop them. l don't know what to do. l don't think they'll ever stop. Those Pokmon are ready to fight to the death. That's a fight that nobody's going to win. Someone's got to take a stand. Someone's got to say no and refuse to fight. Just like Pikachu. Ash, wait! You've got to stop right now! Stop!! Oh, no! Fool, trying to stop our battle. Please, no! The human sacrificed himself to save the Pokmon. l pitted them against each other. Only when they set aside their differences... ...did l see the true power they all share deep inside. l see now that the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant. lt is what you do with the gift of life... ...that determines who you are. Mewtwo, where are you going? Where my heart can learn what yours knows so well. What transpired here, l will always remember. But perhaps for you, these events are best forgotten. -This could be the worst storm ever. -You must listen to me. You have got to find shelter. Excuse me, please. The Pokmon Treatment Center will open as a shelter. Anyone who needs a place to stay should come with me. Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny are really great. They keep getting more beautiful every time l see them. Guys, how did we wind up in this place anyway? Well, l guess we're just here because we're here. Yes, let's eat. Look, it's a miracle! l can't believe it. -The storm disappeared. -That's so weird! lt's good to have things clear again. What's that? What's what? -l don't see anything, Ash. -Except the sky. The day l started my Pokmon journey... ...l saw a really rare Pokmon. And just now, l thought l saw another one. Maybe you're just seeing things, Ash. Maybe he's not. Maybe we'll see. Many strange legends surround the mysteries of Pokmon. Just as many adventures await our heroes... ...as they continue on their quest. For Ash and his friends, the journey's just begun. l don't know how we got here, but who cares? -This is paradise! -For once, a happy ending. Team Rocket's signing off again! Have any unscreen? I'd really like to go sailing in one of them catamarans.
