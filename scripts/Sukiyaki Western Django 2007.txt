You know, them Heike and Genji boys? On a distant island, these two clans split into the Reds and the Whites. To wage a war... Sorta like that a "War of the Roses," you know? In England... Who won? The Whites? This high noon battle, was waged in Dannoura. Near the Heike Clan and Red... Got themselves hog-tied by the Genji Clan and White... Their story, it goes a little something like this... The sound of the Gion Shoja temple bells, echoes the impermanence of all things. What bells you say? The color of the sala flowers reveals the truth that, "to flourish is to fall." You okay fella? The proud do not endure, like a passing dream. On a night in Spring. The mighty fall at last... See you in hell! To be no more than dust before the wind. Ringo! That's why I love you! Presented by Elementxstyle.com Hey! Nothing back there! You ain't heard me? It's a nothing town! Bet you came for the gold too! Well, there ain't none! Which are you? White or Red? You Genji or Heike? Which of you is gonna buy it? My reward's one third... If there is no treasure, no pay! Benkei! Show him... No doubt about who is going to be left standing. You gotta be alive to defend your money... Stranger! Kid's got a heart, and balls to match. No! Join us! We'll do better than a third! We'll give you half! Half? We'll give you everything. But with us, its a lifetime contract. Don't know about that, I don't stay long...in one place. Suits us fine! We'll give you half for this one time deal! How 'bout it?! Not too shabby. Hey! Boy! Hey hey... If you're such a quickdraw, you don't need them! Take it all, and tell them to shove their lifetime contract. Stay out of it! You old bitty! Us grannies can't help but meddle! Boy, don't rush yourself! Make your choice after cooling your heels. This town can't offer you food, but I can offer you some Soba. At my place... Come with me! Hey hey hey hey! Hey! Follow him! Bah! Forget that! Bring him here... I'll teach her good. So the Reds rolled in first, eh? Yeah, how'd you figure that? Simple, the Sheriff. They say the law hitched with the weakest side. Must mean, they made him an offer he couldn't refuse. Of course not. Maybe he's looking for a chance to switch sides. How long's it been like this? Two months, since the Heikes rolled in. And before that, gold prospectors started coming around. (Idiotically) What're you doing here?! (Idiotically) What?! What the hell? But what they couldn't figure out was, why so many people and why now? At the end of last month, a town with the same legend! From the motherload, the country's gone crazy! Those Heike gold terrorizers! Every nook and cranny of every town with the same treasure legend, is swarming with prospectors! Its genuine gold rush! You can't touch this land, you'll be cursed. Ha! We'll take that curse off your hands! No! You see?! We're raised hearing the legends all our lives! And we can't fight which is why, as you lay waste to our land! In the beginning, we expected them to be a Godsend. Because they were Heike, like us. But so soon they started. The Heikes ran off the prospectors and started digging! Look! Kiyomori! Boss Kiyomori! We found this! Instead of that wood marker that read, "Fear the Curse!" I knew it! So they figured the treasure must be somewhere, and the Heike have been here since. From today, you're one of us. Think of it as being on vacation. Yes, I've been meaning to take some time off. Get a little sun myself. Akira! Stop, stop! Don't do anything stupid! Daddy, I'm scared! Stop! Heihachi, son... Men need courage and resolution. I'm scared daddy! Let's go home! Let's go...let's go! They ransacked the resting place of our ancestors. I go and get help. Daddy! ...daddy! Boss Kiyomori. But his reign of power didn't last long. Dang, you boys are a day late and a dollar short! This is our town! Dang! Genji's... Shigemori, you got too fat when you were a boy. Huh? Boss Yoshitsune The Genji's didn't make a move against the Heike's. They left the gold digging to them. Sat back and waited for their chance to steal the wheat. Finders, keepers. After that, people began to leave. Just a few families are left. On the way here, I met a guy leaving town. He said there wasn't any gold. Ah, we might as well hire you. But all the town can offer you is this. Something. Hey, try this. Hey, hey! Welcome back! This is my grandson, Heihachi. So, you boys got it yet? Give it a go. Death, isn't to be feared. Don't watch the blade! How many times do I have to tell you? Don't follow the blade with your eyes! Don't see it! Feel it! Thats the essence of Mononofu training. Mononofu training ain't somewhat ancient. Being a Samurai is a philosophical way of life. But the life of Mononofu means a life of fighting! If you ask me, Samurai are still wearing their skippies? They're vein, they're still concerned about their looks. That's tits on the pool thinking! ^^ But if you peel away that last layer. So you...are naked. This and a real fighting spirit is, Warriors luck in life. This realm... Our realm! Is deeper than the Samurai's. Now... You will come at me, or whistle dixie. Why...? Why were we born in this spineless age! What's it gonna be? Take this handsome man to the Reds, or hand him over to the Whites. You know? I must say... I don't know. Depends on him. Today's special is the Whites, with a side of mashed potatoes and soup! Forget about the Heike gang! They're boss Kiyomori smells like a dead dog on a hot day! He's lost so much he's getting dumber. Goddamnit! Sheriff's late. The sound, of the...Gion Shoja temple bells. Echoes the impermanence of all things. You follow? Yes, I...uh... It means, everything in this old world changes. It means we can never call ourselves out. We'll finally restore the glory of our family name, and then ride in high. The Genji gang will be left in ruins. The color of the sala flowers reveals the truth, that to flourish is to fall. Thats it. Its a law of nature, the Genji's are going down! From today... I read this. What's that? Shakespeare...Henry the VI. The War of the Roses. War of the...Roses? Camel boy, don't you know your Shakespeare? Its a story about the Reds winning the war. The Reds...win? Yes, we'll win! Yea! Kiyomori! What?! Kiyomori... Don't ever call me Kiyomori again! From today... The name's...Henry. Mwahaha! Hey quit that shit! Okay, you got it! From today you are Henry! ...Boss. Henry! Henry! Now? Side with the Genji's! They got a lady, a young fine ass cream gravy! That lady used to be a dancer! She's the kid's mama, but still mighty fine. Hasn't aged a bit. A woman of true Genji lineage. He's Genji and Heike? Huh? Oh...the kid? Yeah, he's a half-breed. And his father? Got himself killed. You of the same stock...boy? F-F-F...Fine, fine! Nani?! He can't talk no more. How do you, after seeing your dad murdered. What's his mother doing on the Genji side? To begin with, that granny's boy went to work in the city. Then one day that boy, her son Akira. Brought a Genji woman home. Mama, the days of being Genji or Heike...are done with. I don't know how or where the two met. But his mother blessed their marriage. So Red and White got hitched. And they figured crossing roses, literally with both colors...was romantic. And they raised Heihachi. Their Red and White treasure. But then the fighting started again. Finders keepers... Kiyomori! Get out! There ain't no gold here! That's it? Take it all! If you want it? Take it! And get out! Daddy! Heihachi! Daddy! Red rose... My favorite color looks good on you. Folks say a Genji woman painted Red, was a flaming hymn. I teach you well! I show you! A good time! I know! I know! So she ran to the hideout of her own flesh and blood. Was it to protect her son, or get vengeance for her husband? You too, Sheriff. Sure! Don't mind if I do. How much for the lady? Say what?! How much you got? Depends on how much you're payin' me. Keep it in your pants, little liver. The tougher man gets the girl. Do what you like. Do it here, or upstairs. Wherever and however you please. You're the second calling wolf I ever really wanted to draw iron at. Who was the first? A legend... One I heard, when I was a kid. Oh yeah? The bloody... Benten... Bloody Benten The Fighting Goddess...legend. Shit! Now I really want to draw iron at you! Nice...huh? Ain't fine, but it hits you deep down. The Anasazi play that music. They were here before any of us. They still keep, the old ways. You'll do fine. I want Kiyomori dead. You've sold away your body...everything. All for revenge. So what?! Don't pity me, I don't need useless compassion from you. Good, I just mumbled something you don't understand. Do you want me? Yes. I want you...very much. But be careful, Yoshitsune's men left town to get that powerful weapon. Yoichi wants you dead. They'll likely be here by sun up. When the shooting starts, take Heihachi and escape to the mountains. You're not gonna run? Oh, you got something against them too? I got my reasons. Have the roses bloomed yet? What are they named? Love. They're cold. Here in my scabbard, meditating that. (They are reciting lines from Henry VI; Act 2, Scene IV) Shall dye your white roses in a bloody red. Here... Meantime, your cheeks do...count- Counterfeit our roses, for pale they look with fear... as witnessing the truth on our side. No, Plantagenet, not for fear but anger that thy cheeks blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses. And yet! Thy tongue will not confess thy error. That Sheriff's late! Bring him here you idiot! Somethings you gotta see through. What're you gonna do now? I bet Kiyomori is going nuts. Maybe he hasn't figured out he's been betrayed yet. He may be dense, but he ain't stupid. No, no no no...He hasn't got a clue. As long as we... So you want go back to their side? Too late for that. You said it! So what do we do now?! Don't get impatient. He ain't going nowhere for awhile. You reckon? You just watch. At least, as long as we stay here, we're safe. We got time. Why don't you take a dump? And have a think? Howdy Sheriff... A special weapon will be here soon. Can't let the Genji's get it. Tell the Heike to obstruct their wagons, if you don't we'll all be killed. Sorry... What are you doing boy?! Shit, well get off your butt! Hold your horses. Instead of telling the god awful truth, don't you reckon we'd better high tail it? I ain't listening to you no more! Kiyomori! Boss Kiyomori! Name's Henry! Where have you been?! I was spying on the Genji's. And things are getting really out of hand. Excuse me... Come again? Stupid cow! I told you we should've skipped town... I told you. Shit! Go! Fear nothing! Watch it! Thats dangerous! Shigemori! What?! You did this! Fire boys, he's climbing out the window! How'd he pull that off? Come! Ichiro, Matsui! Follow me. What happened? I'll tell you later, we're going to the old man's place! Heihachi! Come on hurry! This way! Watch your step. Take Heihachi and go without me! What did you forget?! Something important! What...who?! Forget them you don't need them! No! They're-! They're... They're...my...ours! No matter what, one of you's gonna die! Heihachi! Please, please, please! If you want them to live... Drop...your...guns! No more! Quit your bitchin'! The time is now! Hey, hey! Die! Lucky me... Henry! Henry! Shigemori...I won't die until we win. Payback's a bitch! A she's the shit! Before you die... I have something sweet to show you! You want some bitch? You animal... Toshio! Throw it here! Can't be... Bloody....B- Heihachi! What are you doing? Open your eyes! See for yourself! You can't close them! Open your eyes! Heihachi! Heihachi! Open your eyes! What were you doing acting alone?! You got balls, but no brain! Ruriko, why did you hide this from me? I thought we were friends. Sorry but... Could you visit this address? And stock up on these. If he is still alive. My signature here, should help you out. I wish I could go, but I can't leave the boy alone. Ruriko... But these are guns? Tell him, I need help and he owes me. You are the only one I can depend on. So she's still kickin' eh? What's BB? When this devily talented goddess, used to played music... she would hold her instruments in both hands. But when she was on the warpath, she held her weapons in eight hands. When the fire of her vengeance twittled in her eyes this smothering goddess was wide awake and everything in her way got stained blood red. The Bloody Benten Nickname...double B for short. I was the one who educated her in killing. And it was tough going. You like it? Too sweet. There's too much sugar. This is Sukiyaki not a damn pot! I-I-I'm so sorry! How many times do I gotta tell you, before it sinks into that thick skull of yours... That you draw the sweetness out of the Chinese cabbage. And this Tofu...its not authentic! B-But the Tofu was sold out! Excuses! Go on! Darn excuses! Dang useless woman, why I ever thought I could make a gun fighter out of- Listen up girl. If this were a gun fight. You wouldn't be sayin you got bullets that shoot beans instead, now could ya? That'd mean dud to me and you wouldn't it? Hmm? Wouldn't it? That's my girl, there you go. Never let your guard down. The Grim Reaper hisself grows in that pot, don't forget that. I-I... The sugar! Sugar helps me. Lordy lord... You ain't pregnant is you? I reckon it will be a bouncing boy. Sigh Aw heck! You mean Akira? Akira, how the lovely sound of that name brings me back. What can I say. At the end, I am an enemy of the cold dagger. What? How's my boy? I saw... That's why you've come for them irons eh? You tell her this for me. "Sayonara dake ga jin sei da" Life is all about goodbyes. We are in your debt! I'm surprised. He's still alive. I guess. Every man's got his own reasons. For why he had to keep on living. Got a cold? Don't you have one too?! Amazing... You are some freak of nature. The old man's medicine did the trick. Thank ya. You going, huh? Yeah. Going...where to? To settle a score. What score? The town's got nothing to do with you! Shit just happens, thats all. So the meaning of rivalry is shit happens, heh? Well I don't wanna run from..."The Shit" anymore. Shit... If you don't take the cake, sorry but could you fetch the treasure for me? There is one? Ruriko...what about the town law? As anyone who has been getting around here knows, he was chosen to guard it. That's the town law. I thought Heihahi would be the next chosen one. But he is too weak. I reckon he was born at the wrong time, and in the wrong place. He does have a gift for music though. But tenderness alone won't get you far in life. What're you going to do with the treasure? Settle this, once and for all! If we lose, they can have it. If we win, you can have half...how about it? You game? Suits me fine. Okay then. This way! No! This way! I ain't gonna listen to you no more! That's my line! I kill you! Smells like victory. Got the Mr. Gatling riding shotgun. And now a shield. A shield? If you won't fight, it would be perfect. Mwahaha! Hey hey! Hold on! Come on now! Hey! No! Shit! If I get taken down...will you get this to Heihachi for me? I'll think about it. If and when you die. Hey! Hey! I'll carry the treasure for you. I carried the gun, and if the end carries you! Then let me do it! If you weren't the most stubborn man I ever did meet. Let him take it. A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. Go, go! We get shot, and you are the one thats gonna get smoked. Not me! You die first! No! You die first! We die! Ok we die, we die...I die, you die, he dies, she dies, we die! Everybody dies! It takes truly something for people to finally learn. The way to your loyal heart, with love. Yoshitsune... I'll make you... Notice me. Here is...! The treasure! How about it boys?! Winner takes all! Hey look! Gold! Spread out! Yoshitsune! B-Benkei? So re! Yoshitsune! I think I sprained my ankle! Where're those Heike boys?! Here we go! Yeah! No! Get down! You've got a new toy? Yoshitsune! This time, we win! This time, we win! This time... That's for the mayor. I win... I win! I ain't dead. 'Til I beat you. This is for Akira. Its all mine! Its mine! Its all ours! I...always... Don't say it... No one in the world ever saved Benten's life. Except for you. You... You're Ruriko. My...Ruriko. Now this... Is what I call class. So that old granny, was Bloody Benten..eh? I'm glad I came here. Hell, I'm glad I was born. Finally, with a worthy opponent. I can risk my life to the death. Victory... ...or death! That's plenty for me. You keep the rest. Just do me one thing. Tend to the roses for me. But when it doesn't feel right, you can stop. Now you've got money, you got the gun, and the roses too. Heihachi... Son, no matter what the times may be. No matter where you are. What matters is you, and how you deal with this world. And there ain't no running from it. Don't run. Decide for yourself what tomorrow's gonna be. Love. Your mother was a mighty fine lady.
