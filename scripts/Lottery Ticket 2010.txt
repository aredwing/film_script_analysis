When you hear me say ''miracles''... ...l'm not talking about Smokey Robinson and the four brothers out of Detroit!

Kevin, look. All you gotta do is get through the next day and a half... -...and we good. -And then what? Then you get your money. ls this what having money feels like? Huh? Everybody asking me for something? People l ain't talked to in years calling my phone? l don't want it, man. l heard this quote once: ''Money don't change you, it changes the people around you.'' You understand that? Come on, Kev. l heard this quote too. We quoting now? We quoting now? l got this quote: ''People gonna be people. They gonna lie, they gonna cheat and they gonna steal. As long as you get yours, you keep it moving.'' -So let's go home. -lt's not that easy, Benny. It's not. -Kev, how about this? -What? Let me hold onto it for you. Let you hold onto what? The ticket. That case, if Lorenzo catches you, you won't get jacked. You too? After what l just said to you? And you hit me with this bullshit? -lt ain't like that. -What you mean, ''lt ain't like that''? -lt is like that. It is! -lt ain't like that. -You losing it, man. -You got the wrong one. -You serious? -Dead-ass serious. Come on, Kev. -l been your best friend since fifth grade. -Act like it. -Fifth grade! -Act like it! Ain't no way l'll let this money compromise our friendship. Okay. You can have it. You can have this shit, Kev. You can have the whole thing. l don't want it! -l don't want none of this! -What you got? l'm up here losing my damn mind, running up and down the streets for us! -Ain't no ''us'' shit! Ain't no us, nigga! -lt is us, Kev! It is us! -lt's everybody! -What you talking about? You ain't in my shoes, you don't know. -Look at this, look at us. l'm not looking. Look at our circumstances, man. Look where we from! l'm tired of this, man. l'm sick of worrying about WIC cards! l'm sick of worrying about the government l can't eat! l'm broke, nigga! l'm broke! And you got the power to change that, Kev. Nobody else. You. Kevin, if l had the money... ''lf.'' ...not only would l give back... ...l would change lives. The sad thing is, you known me for this long and you still don't get it. Bust a move, homey. You want me to be honest? That's why l'm here, right? Look, you know l can't even stand Benny half the time... ...but he is not a thief, and you know it. lf anything, that boy is too loyal to you. You probably hurt his feelings, and l personally think you acted like an ass. -And you need to tell him you're sorry. -What? That's the truth. - Central Bank on Wednesday.... What? You said you wanted me to be honest, right? Stacie. -What's up? lf you won the lottery, what would you do? Me? l mean, you know... ...take care of my family, travel... ...finish school, all that good stuff. But if l had your kind of money, l'd give back. Give people something to live for instead of just living, you know? Like, look at how some of these rappers always talk about, ''Shout out to my 'hood.'' But what are they giving back other than just shoutouts? Thank you. lt's cool, it's just a grilled cheese. No, no. Not for the sandwich. Just thanks for being there for me. l mean that. lt's cool. l got you. l appreciate it. -But now l need you to tell me something. -What's up? What happened on your little date with Nikki Swayze? Say ''l told you so.'' All she wanted to be was my baby mama. Wow, what? Nikki, the no-class, gold-digging bitch. l'm shocked. l mean, but at least you got what you wanted: To tell all your boys you hit that. Because l didn't. God on my mama, l ain't touched that girl. Mm-hm. l'm kind of glad l didn't too. What do l look like? Swapping swords with half of the Fortune 500. l'm straight. And besides... ...that's not the kind of girl l need anyway. Oh, really? Who is the kind of girl you need, then? Can l be honest? Ain't that why you came here? The kind of girl l need is you. Goodbye, Kevin. Goodbye. What, you gonna kick me out? You know what? l'm not interested in being your second choice. How long have we known each other? Why did it take you so long to tell me this? Oh. After you and Nikki, all of a sudden you wanna be with me? Why'd it take you so long? l'm not that girl, okay? Don't get it - twisted. -Hold on, hold on. -What? -Wait, hold on. -What? Wait. Tst. Damn, girl, how many dudes you done had up in your bed? What? Don't try to play me. lf you think we're doing this without a condom, you're tripping. What? Nothing. Stacie! -Oh, shit, it's my mama! -Your mama? You gotta go. -Damn, your mama? -What? Come on. -You gotta - Get out! No! -What? Let me go. -Out where? -Get out. Out the window? -Sorry. Yes. -Careful. Goddamn. -Are you okay? -l'm fine. Please be careful. Okay. -What? -l love you. l love you too. Now go. Get down. Where am l? Morning. Now, relax now, son, relax. Don't worry about nothing, you just got knocked the fuck out. Put these black-eyed peas on your jaw. Take down the swelling. What you talking about? Man, are you crazy? Ain't nobody knock me out. Hold on. Wait a minute. Where's my ticket? l don't know. They probably stole it. That's why you was knocked out. -Yeah. -Damn! Yeah, that about sums it up. Wait a minute. How do l know you didn't knock me out yourself and stole my ticket? The fact of the matter is Lorenzo and his boys was out there walking. l heard them talking and laughing. l get up, l look and see you stretched out. Now, it wasn't easy... ...but l pick you up and l tote you in here and put you on that couch. And you talk to me like that? l ain't been out this apartment in 22 years and l did it for you. You did that? What l wanna know is, did you sign the back of the ticket? Why would l sign the ticket? lf you didn't sign the back of the ticket, it's not valid. -The cops is not gonna believe you. -No, no. Man, bump that! Look, he stole my ticket. l should be able to go right back to him and get it back, straight up! Okay, tiger. Okay. But look, Lorenzo's a premature crack-baby felon, okay? You gotta be careful. What other choice do l have? Well, l been thinking. The same thing got you into this mess... -...might just get you out. -Man, l'm not trying to hear that. -Wait, wait, wait -What? -Where you going? -l'm out, man. Hold up. You took my sneakers? l was thinking about it. But they wasn't on your feet when l dragged you in here. You wouldn't have did nothing. Protect yourself at all times. Whatever! Protect yourself at all times. Don't do this with this boy. l'm too old for this. Whoo! Thank you, Jesus! Thank you, Jesus! Thank you, Jesus! Oh. Where the hell you been, boy? l been worried sick about you. Nobody know where you is, you didn't call. What happened? And where are your shoes? -l got robbed! -What? Lorenzo took everything, all right? Look, he took my ticket, he took my shoes.... Oh. No, l'm calling the police. Chill out. Don't do that. What they gonna do? l didn't sign the back of the ticket. Boy, l told you. You'd given me that ticket, l'd put it here, wouldn't nobody get to it. Look, l got 24 hours to go claim what's mine, all right? And that's what l'm about to go do. That's how it is. Oh, hell, no. l'm calling somebody. Stacie? Watch it. Watch. -Come on, come on. Bet back, bet back. -What up, B? Nothing. Chilling with my real friends. What's up with you? That ain't no dirty dice. That's my money on the ground, fool. Let me holler at you real quick, man. Your drawers is dirty, not my dice. Come on, man. What's up, Kev? Look, man. l'm sorry about what happened on the roof the other day. l mean that, man. Look, Kev, l know my approach to life might be a little off... ...but just know my intentions are good. -We boys? -We boys. All day. Kevin, you got that Bobby Brown look in your eyes, man. What you doing? Where the hell you been, man? You harder to find than a job. Man, like you would know. You ain't had a job since Thriller. -Where Lorenzo at? What? Lorenzo Mack? l saw him yesterday when he was racing you up and down the street. Man, listen. When y'all see Lorenzo, Iet him know l'm looking for his ass. -Tell him that. Don't say nothing. Kevin.... -Wait - Is he looking for? -He wants to find Lorenzo? You seen Lorenzo? Calm down. -Shut up, man. -Little girl, you seen Lorenzo? My friend's crazy. -This is crazy. -Move! He's not out here. -Kev, look, he's bigger than you. -Y'all seen Lorenzo? -Don't mind him. Hey, where you at? Man, bring your ass outside! Talking all that shit! Where you at now? -Kevin, just calm down. -Shut up! Right there. -Don't get your ass kicked. l got your ass now! -Boy, what the hell's wrong with you? -All right. You think because you got money, you can just knock people down? Huh? You want ice cream? Get in line like everybody else. -l don't want no damn ice cream! It's good. Look, good as new. -What's wrong with you? Get off me! Kevin! Damn. Hey. Just the man l wanted to see. Kevin, take a ride with me. Few things l wanna talk over. -lt's all right if l don't? -No, not really. Get in the car. -Okay, Kevin, l'm coming with you. -Come on. Stay right there. First of all, let me apologize for that incident outside the church the other day. l mean, that was entirely my fault. l should've never let you out of my sight. From now on... ...wherever you go... ...l go. Speaking of the church... ...is Jimmy the Driver gonna be all right? Is he gonna pull through? -He'll live. -Okay. He won't be on solid food for a while... ...and he probably will never father children... ...but, hey, what can you do? Ahem. Sweet Tee... ...how would you feel if somebody owed you money Not me. - and they couldn't pay you back? Off the top of my head? l'd probably, uh... ...saw his legs off at the kneecaps... ...and then grind them into hamburger meat. And then l'd feed them to my two 100-pound bullmastiffs. Then l would force that guy to watch them eat it. That's pretty gnarly shit, ain't it? Yeah, that's dastardly, l know it. l saw that in the Philippines, that's what gave me the idea. Yeah, you ain't never heard a man scream until you've heard him scream like that. You've never heard a man throw up the way l'm gonna throw up right now. Not in my Bentley. -Damn it, get out! -All right. Close my door. Try to feel better. l'll be around keeping my eye on you. And remember... ...wherever you go, l go. Let's go. -He's gonna kill me. -He said that? No, not exactly. He said he was gonna cut my legs off... ...then feed them to the dogs. Don't pump it up. He said he'd cut you off at the kneecaps. Kevin, you have to give back all his money. lt ain't that simple. l spent it. -What? -Yeah. How did you spend $100,000 in one day? lt's not hard as you might think. l got some earrings. You're just gonna have to return all that stuff you bought. The same way you got into this mess... ...is the same way you're gonna have to get yourself out of it. What? Nothing. It's just that that's the same thing Mr. Washington told me. -Mr. Washington, the serial killer? -Exactly. Stop talking to him. We're already in enough trouble. Stop, all right? Because he's not a serial killer. Wait a minute. lt was Semaj. -lt was Semaj! What about Semaj? No. That's why l'm in this mess right now. Because of him. He told everybody about my ticket. l'm not following. What does Semaj have to do with it? Get up! We gotta leave, now. Yo, man, if you're trying to do what l think you gonna do... ...you must be out your damn mind. So if the one he stole was fake... ...what was your whole nervous breakdown about earlier today? Running all over town, cursing Lorenzo's name... ...knocking folks over... ...and ruining ice cream cones? Had to make it look real, right? Even had you fooled. You. What? Slow down and tell me that one more time. He did what now? Yeah, baby. Yeah, baby. Man, that is the aroma of the beef. Y'all just hating. Hell, no. l'm going vegetarian. Did you make the potato salad too? Kevin, you want something to drink? No, l'm all right. l'm cool. Hey, this my mama recipe. Y'all better back off. You think you slick? You little bitch. Think you gonna get over on me? Oh, man. Oh, come on, Lorenzo. You see how big this nigga look right now? lt's a family barbecue. Grab a plate, get something to eat, all right? We got potato salad, get you a piece of chicken. Chill out, you know Oh, it's that type of party? Okay. It's that type of party. Come on, Kev, throw one on him. What's up? First, l'm about to tell you what's gonna go down. First, l'm gonna beat your ass till l get tired. And l ain't never gonna get tired. Then l'm gonna take that ticket, the real ticket, and walk up out of here. Look, l'm gonna tell you like this, man. You want my ticket? You gonna have to take my ticket, dog. Straight up. Be a man. That's right. That's right, Kev. You gonna have to back up, Lorenzo. lt ain't going down like that today. You gonna have to back up, man, before l bust a cap in your ass, man. Shoot me, ''man.'' Get over here. Cognac, nigga? Not the homeboy. Kev, l'm gonna let you handle that. Look out. Oh, what now? You know who l am? -He don't know. -Yeah, l know who you are. Then you must know l don't play. Now, this young man... ...happens to be my business partner and a close personal friend of mine. l think he's about tired of you harassing him. And frankly, so am l. Look, l ain't got no beef with you. This is between me and him. But you do need to know... ...that he's gonna get his ass whupped today. And l'm gonna leave with that ticket. Now, you see, that's the problem with young folk today. Absolutely no courtesy. No respect! Ooh! Damn! Took all day to make that potato salad! Now, y'all can keep on partying or go home. There ain't gonna be no fight here today. That's it. Look at this punk ass. And y'all said he was supposed to be some kind of a tough guy. You know what l'd do with a bitch like you in my ''cellie''? Make you snuggle up with me at night. And l squeeze your balls. l squeeze. And l squeeze! Oh, man! Oh, hell, no. This nigga's some kind of goddamn superthug. -Tee! Get up, Tee. Go home, Lorenzo! Now, where were we? Oh, snap. Come on, Kev. Yeah, man, hit him back! My grandmama hit harder than you. Get back. -That's right, kid. Whup his ass. -That's right. Come on, man. Come on. Jesus, l can't Stay down! Just stay down. l gotta give it to you. You got a lot of heart. But heart only gets you so far, son. Don't give it to him, Kevin. What say we do this old school? Yo! Pick a number between one and 10. Pick! Three. All right. That's how many seconds you got to hand it over before l start blasting. -Come on. -Counting down. Three. Two. All right. Lorenzo, you should be ashamed! -l was hoping l'd get to use this. You know what? l'm gonna hold onto both of these. Just in case... ...you got a little funny with the tickets. Nice doing business with you. Oh, before l forget.... Bitches didn't fit anyway. Say, young blood. You like that, huh? That's good work. Somebody read him a bedtime story. Mr. Washington? You're the man, Mr. Washington. Yeah, Mr. Washington! He's a bad mother - Shut your mouth. Didn't l tell you? l hear everything. Everything. Come on, out of here, Bobby Brown. l know you got it. Now, lookie here, boy. Keep ahold of these things. You put them in a safe place. You hear? -All right? -All right. Safe place. There's a lot of crazies around here. All right. Still got it. You let them know l still got it, right? Let them know. Any of you young punks want your ass whupped, step on in. -They don't want none. -No, they don't want none. Let them know l still got it. Damn. Mr. Washington's pretty cool for a serial killer. Baby. Kevin. -Unh. Stacie. -Are you okay? -Kev. -Damn. -Please sign the ticket. -Yes. Well, here it go. Yes, you heard right. He got the numbers from a fortune cookie at the Hunan Grill. So a month after graduating high school... ...Kevin Carson is the youngest winner in the Mondo Millions lottery. Asked what he'd do with the money... ...he said he'd start his own line of sneakers... ...and ''Give a little something to the Fillmore.'' People not from here may not understand. This is a community. This is our community. As long as we stay together... ...no matter how many times life knocks us down, we can't lose. See, that's why l wanna make this park safe for all kids. And to make sure that it stays that way... ...l would like to introduce the head of security: Mr. Jerome ''Thump'' Washington. Please, everybody. Hey, look, any of you young punks wanna get knocked out, just let me know. Oh, look. You wanna do the honors? -Don't mind if l do. -All right. Here we go. There it is. All right, all right.
