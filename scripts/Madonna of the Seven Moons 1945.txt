He thinks you have been with us long enough and now you ought to take your proper place in life. I But, Reverend Mother I want to stay here always. That's just how I'd like you to feel. But we can't always think of ourselves, my child. Your father has plans for your future. You've heard of Mr Guiseppe Labardi? I met him once. - With Father. - Mr Labardi wants to marry you. It would make your father very happy. Marry? No, no. I don't want to get married. I want to stay here with you always. - You want to disappoint your father? - No, Reverend Mother. We shall miss you, Maddalena. I want you to take this prayerbook for your comfort always. - Thank you, Reverend Mother. - Bless you, my child. - It's so quaint and charming. - I've had that prayerbook for years. It was given me just before I was married. Now, about this idea of yours, sister, I'd really much rather not. Madame Labardi, without you, there would have been no children's ward in our hospital. It's only right that it should bear your name. I couldn't possibly agree to that. I meant to have done so much more for the children than I have. Much more for my own daughter too. Well? Did you persuade Maddalena? No, Mr Labardi, she would not consent. I warned you that she will not advertise. - Mario. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Pity Botticelli isn't alive. I would like him to paint you as you are now. - He painted saints. - I know. Looking at that map again? I suppose it's all right for Angela and that girl to come all the way from England by car at their age. Why, of course. She must be having the time of her life after being in school for five years. That's what I'm afraid of. It may be too much for her. - She's such a quiet, retiring child. - She was. When I last saw her in England, she'd come a long way out of her shell. School and England will have changed her quite a bit, you know. I hope not too much. Five years is a long time to be separated from your daughter. I'm looking forward to picking up the old threads. Frankly, my dear, I should forget about the old threads. Be prepared for some new ones. We've got to move with the times. - Her times. - I hate them coming all that way alone. Let's look at that map. They must have broken the back oftheir journey by now. Let me see. Here we are. They crossed from Dover to Calais on Monday morning. So if I'm any judge, by now they should've reached Cannes. In the back. There'll be three of us. - Are you going far, monsieur? - Rome, but breaking the journey at Florence. - Hello, Angela. You ready? - You haven't got to go just yet? - Yes. - I wish I was going with you. - What a lovely time last night. - Goodbye, everybody. - We've been ditched! Millie isn't coming. - Rubbish. Of course she is. - She isn't, Evelyn. - Why not? Just another of her crushes. She's just like her mother. - You don't mean that dancer fellow? - Sandro Barucci. It's a lovely name even if you don't like the rest of him. - I'll talk to her. - It won't do any good. - Angela! - Sandro! We were just talking about you. Somebody ought to drop you in a pond. Why? It was Millie's idea staying on here not mine. Then they ought to drop you in two ponds. Don't be silly, Lyn. You ought to be grateful. - It leaves you and Angela alone. - Now, look here, Millie... Oh! - Come on, Angela, let's go. - Have a good time, darlings. Au revoir, Angela. We shall meet again. - Bye, everybody. Goodbye! Hey, Sandro, I thought you said those flowers were for me. - For you, orchids. - Where are they? There you are. Soon be there. Bear up a little longer. How very unromantic. Thought you liked it. I do, enormously. But I don't want to run into anything. Then you shouldn't have such a comfortable shoulder. I suppose you think I'm a responsibility. A nice one, but I'm taking no risks. Is that why they put you in the Diplomatic Service? Of course! I wonder why I like you so much. You're not a person I expect to like. - Lyn, did you wire about our rooms? - Yes, Hotel Barbarelli. With baths. - I hope they have a swing band! - Band? Aren't you supposed to be tired? I'm never too tired to dance. - I wonder if I take after Maddalena. - Who? My fond mama. Can you imagine the glorious time we're going to have? Dances, parties, theatres. Perhaps she isn't that kind of mother. - What a terrifying thought. - I don't know. I would give someone else the chance. - You, for instance? - Ifthere isn't too much competition. - Oh, I dare say there will be. - Now, you listen to me. No. I'm much too tired. Don't bother with that thing. Ask somebody. Excuse me. Could you direct me to the Hotel Barbarelli? I'm sorry, I don't live here. Excuse me. Are you a stranger in these parts? No. You are. We are looking for the Hotel Barbarelli. You go straight down that road for about 200 yards. Then you turn left. Not the first turning or the second, the third. - By the statue. After that... - Thanks. We'll find it somehow. Never mind, I'll go. Yes, yes, I'm coming. Can't you hear I'm coming? - Good afternoon, Tessa. - Dr Ackroyd, I didn't know it was you. - Mr Labardi phoned for me. - I know, I listened to him. - My dear Charles, how nice of you. - She didn't sleep much, Doctor. Overexcited, I expect, with Miss Angela coming home. Thank you, Tessa, I'll tell him. I was in and out of her room a dozen times. - I don't expect much is the matter. - That's just where you're wrong. - When I took in her coffee... - All right, Tessa. - How thoughtful of you. - Flowers, often the best medicine. You know, I believe you are almost as fond of her as I am. Fonder. Come and tell her that. It will cheer her up. - Wait. Have you heard from Angela? - No, not yet. Well, indirectly, I have. From Mrs Fiske. That scatterbrain daughter of hers dropped off at Cannes - and left Angela to come on alone. - Guiseppe! Why, my dear! - Charles, it isn't true? - Why not? Good job too. Millie Fiske is the last person I'd want in a car. - That means Angela is alone. - Teach her to be independent. - All this coddling is out of date. - Of course it is. Take her along with you, Charles. I'll get some cocktails. We'll drink to the return ofthe prodigal, shall we? I brought you these. - You're very kind. - You're very silly. Jumping at shadows. Looking for dangers where they don't exist. I sometimes wonder what we get from religion if it isn't faith. Angela is little more than a child. My dear, in England, girls are used to going about alone. From what Guiseppe tells me, your daughter is more than capable. You don't know the things that can happen. Amul things. What kind ofthings? It's a mistake to expect Angela to behave like a girl from a convent. This is an unconventional age. Whether we like it or not, it's the age we're living in. Why are you telling me all this? Because I hope that you and your daughter are going to be friends. And confidantes. Not just to live together but to be together. Oh, that bell. Keeps on ringing! All right, Tessa, I'll take it. Give the boy ten lire. Ten lire! Just for ringing a bell? - Here we are, news at last. - From Angela? Mm-hm. "Stopped night at Florence. Arriving about six with Evelyn. " - Evelyn? - She's a new one on me. You've no need to worry now. She's found another girl to come with. - What time was it handed in? - 11.45. - I could've walked in the time! - Six o'clock. She ought to be here soon. By Jove, Charles, you're right. I think I'll put these flowers in her room. This merits a long procession of quick ones. Happy days. Angela! - Daddy! - Angela, my dear. Now go and kiss your mother. It isn't possible. Nobody could be so lovely. - Mummy, darling! - I wouldn't have known you. Oh, I adore the new house, what I've seen of it. Grand to be home. Did you hear the dirty trick Millie played on me? She got stuck on a man and ditched us. Evelyn and I had to come alone. We stopped the night in Florence and spent an hour in the art gallery before coming here. Oh, but of course! You don't know Evelyn. Wait while I give him a shout. He's wrestling with the suitcases. Oh, Lyn! Did she say "he"? - She. - Sounded like he. - Drops her Ss, I should think. - He's coming. What's wrong? Oh, my shorts. Couldn't wear anything else in this weather. Modest of you not to wear a bathing costume. Here he is. Evelyn Penshurst. Come and shake hands like a nice little gentleman. Reading from left to right, Daddy, Mummy, and er... A gentleman with a smile. - Dr Charles Ackroyd, my dear. - Doctor of music, I hope! - Hot music. - Angela! - How are you, Doctor? - I refuse to tell you. Quite right. She doesn't deserve it. Tessa! Aren't you going to give me a kiss? Bless her little heart. She hasn't forgotten. Come on, Evelyn, don't stand there gaping. I Madame Labardi I'm afraid our coming alone, you'll think... We think nothing ofthe kind. Let's go and have a drink. Now it's your turn to do some talking. I'm so glad to have you with me, I can think of nothing to say. Anyway, you must be very tired. Why don't you go up to your room and rest for a while? - I'll bring you up some milk... - Milk? Rest? Darling! I'm not still in the nursery, you know. - This is more our line, isn't it? - Angela! - That's a cocktail. - I should hope so too, with a father in the wine trade. Mother doesn't like me to drink anything stronger than cough mixture. - Young man, tell us about yourself. - Well, he's very... I should like to, sir, ifAngela would let me get a word in edgeways. He's fairly civilised. He's kind to animals and old people. He's a rising light in the Diplomatic Service. For the Lord's sake, put a sock in it. It must seem unconventional, Angela and I finishing our journey alone. But quite honestly, we had no choice. That doesn't excuse you locking my room and sleeping with the key under your pillow! - An absolute lie! - For my part, I applaud the action. She ought to be permanently under lock and key. If you'll excuse me, I'll get along. - Where are you staying? - Embassy. - Why not dine with us? - I've promised to feed with some old friends. - The Logans. Perhaps you know them? - No. Well, if I haven't made too ghastly an impression, perhaps you'll let Angela dine with me some night. Hey! What are you talking about? I don't have to ask permission. Well, goodbye. And thanks for the buggy ride. You'd better see him off, my dear. - Suppose I'd better. - Goodbye, Madame Labardi. - Goodbye, sir. - Come on! Well, Maddalena? Shall we take a turn in the garden? - It has been fun, hasn't it? - Tremendous fun. Have you enjoyed being with me as much as I've enjoyed being with you? Well, I don't know how much you've enjoyed being with me. More than I've ever enjoyed being with anyone. As this kind of conversation never ends, I propose carrying Angela offto see her room. Yes, of course. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. Goodbye. See you again soon. Oh, Daddy, darling! It's a dream! Yes, but you must thank your mother. It's all her doing. Oh, Mummy is sweet. She's thought of everything. You know, Angela, your homecoming means more than you imagine to her. - Have I been a success? - Well, er... We live a very quiet life here. You are like a gust of fresh air. - Isn't that a good thing? - A breath, yes. But you are rather a gust, you know. - You don't mean I've hurt her? - No. She just needs time to realise how different you are from the little girl she used to know. - I was sent away to be different. - Of course. There's nothing to pull down the corners of your mouth about. She'll fall into your ways and you into hers. - But do it gently, darling. - All right. I know it's high spirits but all my life, I've tried to avoid the world and now it seems to have rushed in on me. The answer's simple. Develop the other side of your nature to meet it. I have no other side. What I am, I am... Yes, but it should be possible... What's the matter, Maddalena? Oh, Mummy, my room is lovely... What's wrong? Is she ill? I don't like it. It isn't natural. Here you are. There's something on her mind, Guiseppe. A shadow on her mind. What is it? Oh, just nerves. She is as nervous as a kitten. Yes, but why? She loves you, she loves her daughter, she has a hundred useful interests in life, and yet... something seems to be haunting her. - Some... - Between ourselves she's often been like this. Often? When did you first notice it? Soon after we were married. - You were living in Florence then? - Yes. We moved to Rome because I felt that a change might do her good. Did you consult any doctors in Florence? Yes, several. - Who were they? - I'm a perfect fool about names. What did they say about her? Oh... The usual thing. Plenty of care and rest. It's so long ago... Guiseppe, why didn't she go to England with you to see Angela? Charles, as a friend, there are questions which I... .. which I beg you not to ask. But I came here today as a doctor. Then I've told you all I can. # Swing Darling! I wondered where the music was coming from. I'm sorry, Mummy. Did it disturb you? Not a bit. I'm glad to see you happy. - Oh, you are a pip. - Such a change. I wouldn't have believed it possible. Darling, those things... You've hardly anything on. Now, Mummy. You listen to me. Woollies, mufflers, body belts and gaiters are things ofthe past. Do you think you can remember that? - Yes, but... - Let me go on. Fresh air is a tonic. - Freedom, the finest thing. - Yes, dear, I know. But this isn't London. You see, here we lead a very quiet life. Perhaps before very long, suitable young men will be calling. - They'll expect to find you... - A nice, little, tame mouse! Yes, I know, dear. But I'm not a tame mouse. - You won't be a tame mouse either! - I? You're young and attractive enough to have a wonderful time. - I'm going to see you get it. - But I'm quite content as I am. You've no right to be content at your age. I'm going to take you in hand. My education's finished. Yours is just beginning! Now, let me see... Now, isn't this charming, Madame Labardi? Oyster pink is such a wonderful colour for you. Yes, it's very lovely. But it's not quite what I wanted for Mummy. Mummy wants something a little more sophisticated. - Do I? - Yes, ofcourse, darling. That's the whole idea. - I prefer this one myself. - It's very attractive, Mummy. - But it isn't quite what we want. - Oh, madame, it's very smart. The most frightful garment ever. Take it away. Never bring it near me. It's a terrible thing. Why, it looks like something the cat brought in. Really, I wouldn't be seen dead in it. It makes me look most peculiar! - Mummy, you are most peculiar. - I refuse to wear a thing like that. Madame Fiske! C'est parfait for madame's waistline. Refer to my waistline at your peril. Never in the whole of my life have I seen such an atrocity! I demand to see... Why, Miss and Madame Labardi, I didn't realise anyone was here. Hello, Angela, dear. How are you, my dear? How nice to see you at a show like this. Now, that's the sort of thing I should wear. Well, it would be warmer for you, wouldn't it? Yes. You see, I've rather an elusive line. It's never the same for two weeks on end. In that way, it has an extraordinary resemblance to my late husband. Here today, gone tomorrow. Although it's nearly three years since he compelled me to divorce him. We had a gorgeous time. Sandro taught me all the latest steps. I'll bet. I don't know whether you do, or are, or have contemplated a divorce, but if you have or do, I really wouldn't. They cost a great deal and are not nearly as good as they are painted. If you don't mind, I really must be going. - What's that for? - Gratitude. You're coming out into a new world. Angela's world. I suppose I am. Because it's warm and friendly and natural, you're going to like it. I hope so. Nice, my dear. You haven't played that for a long time. Mummy looks lovely in that new dress. She always looks lovely, even without your unholy influence. I've only one suggestion. Why don't you wear that old Cellini pendant? For the good and sufficient reason that it was stolen in Florence. Stolen? You never told me. Was anything else taken? Practically all her jewellery. We won't worry about that now. - Didn't the police do anything? - No. Besides, I was very anxious about your mother's health - which was far more important. - Yes, but... In any case, I am well enough off to buy you or your mother any jewellery you may want. Why didn't you tell me you'd been so ill, darling? I didn't want to frighten you. That's why she never came to England. - I see. - Charles? Thanks. She didn't write to me once for a year. What was the matter, Daddy? Just nerves. Mothing serious. An attack of nerves that lasted a whole year must have been serious. You must ask Dr Ackroyd about that. He was attending her. Oh? I didn't know you attended Mummy in Florence. You poor pet. What form did the illness take, Doctor? Sleepwalking, loss of memory, or what? Is it likely to come on again? Steady, darling, steady. Of course it's not likely to come on again. I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly know. I'm all right. I'm tired. I think I'll go to my room. - You go along with her, Angela. - Oh, Mummy! Why did you say I attended Maddalena? I knew neither of you at the time. To stop awkward questions. Any talk of her illness upsets her. Obviously, but why? What was wrong with her? - Do you mind ifwe drop the subject? - Yes, I do mind. I want to help. As a friend, if not as a doctor. - Won't you tell me? - Have a drink? Then you won't. I was hoping to bring Mummy and teach her dancing. That's all off. For the time being, anyway. How very disappointing. That means we'll have to be alone, doesn't it? - If you can bear it. - I'll have a darn good try. Do you know I haven't had you to myself once since we arrived in Rome? Well, you have now, haven't you? Angela, this takes a bit of saying but... Yoo-hoo, Angela! Well, you two do tuck yourselves away. - I hope we're not butting in? - Not in the least. - That's good. - Still being diplomatic, Evelyn? - Trying to be. - What have you been doing to Evelyn? - He's as bristly as a hairbrush. - You notice I hurried to Rome? Did you? Why? Weren't you earning enough money in Cannes? I got bored with Cannes. Anay, what is money? What a lovely, slender wrist you have. Sandro, I'll dance. Doesn't he know when he's not wanted? Sandro's all right. He's a wonderful dancer. I suppose that makes up for everything. Quite a lot. You better ask him to your birthday on the 16th. I'm going to. Oh. I shan't get much of a look-in, then, shall I? Well, I'll try and keep you the supper dance. What a pity I haven't a girlfriend. Perhaps you can find one between now and then. That's an idea. I think I could. - You can? - Yes. - Nesta. - Who's Nesta? Oh. We've known each other since we were so high. - I'll ask her if you really mean it? - Do, by all means! - Nesta... - Stop it. Stop doing that, Jimmy Logan, while I'm c-cooking for a guest. Evelyn isn't a guest. He's been here every day for two weeks. I do wish he'd talk about something else. It's Angela all the time. Or her mother. If she is that beautiful, I'd give my eye-teeth to paint her. You'd have to use stained glass. No, I see her in blue velvet and... and a tin halo. - S-Stop doing that! - Not until you stop stammering. I c-can't when you're making love to me. Hello there! Hello, you two. Mmm! That smells grand, Nesta. These any good to you? How lovely. Q- Quite the little Santa Claus, isn't he? - Put those on the table. - What's she gibbering like that for? - The truth is... - If you tell him, I'll kill you. Lunch won't be long. Have a cigarette. This is pretty good. Yes, I like it. Oh, it's tripe, but it's the sort oftripe that appeals to summer visitors. - How are you settling down? - Fine. I like Rome. - I'm having the time of my life. - I bet you are. - Come on, here it is. - Would you like to come to a party? No, I don't think so. It's not quite our cup oftea, is it? No. Jimmy's got work to do. We're offto Florence on Friday morning. He's been commissioned to do some pictures for a New York dealer. - What's the party about? - Angela's birthday. - Quite a slap-up affair. - That's different. If I meet her mother, you bet we'll be there. I'll get my one evening dress out of pawn. - You'll meet Angela. - You two engaged yet? - Not officially. - But you I-love her very much, don't you? What's the joke? - She can't mention love without stammering! - Beast! Orchids. How lovely. If I ever marry, I hope my husband will be as attentive as you are. The signs are very promising. - Is your mother dressed yet? - I don't know. But Tessa tells me it's come off, the new gown I persuaded her to wear. I'm sorry. What is she going to wear? - The new gown! - It hasn't come off, it's going on. I don't understand halfthe things you say. Oh, Daddy! There's to be no nonsense about it. If you feel the least bit tired, up to bed you come. - Whatever anybody says. - Don't fuss, Tessa. I shall be perfectly all right. - Who is it? - It's only me. Well, now, that's something like! I But I've told her it's straight to bed if she's at all tired. Get along with you. You're a menace. They're lovely. And so are you. Do you really want me to go down looking like this? Want? I insist! There won't be a woman in Rome to hold a candle to you. You're so good to me, Guiseppe. I love you very, very much. And I, you, my dear. I often think I am the luckiest woman in the world. Never let me go, Guiseppe. Never let me go! May I come in? Oh, Mummy! How wonderful you look! Any hopes you had, young woman, of being the centre of attraction have gone with the wind. Stop staring at me, you two, you're making me embarrassed. I'm offto give the band a drink. - This is for you. - What is it? A little present for being so sweet to me. - Oh, darling, you shouldn't do these things. - Well, I must fly. How beautiful. They must be very old. Like the peasant women used to wear. Yes. Like the peasant women used to wear. Mother of God, why do you look like that? - Like what? - A different person. Someone I've never seen before. Take them away, Tessa. Put them in my jewel box. My dear, what a transformation. You stepped out of one century into another. I'm not sure I feel comfortable in the new one. You'll feel uncomfortable when you look as I do. Had I your figure, I would run naked through the hemlock without a blush! That would be a very moving spectacle. - Have you brought Millie with you? - No. She'll be here presently. You don't expect her to go out with her mother? Do you know, I think your wife is the loveliest person I've ever seen. As compliments are flying, Mrs Logan, may I say how very charming you are in that frock? I'm glad. It was a pair of curtains yesterday. My husband's longing to meet her but I don't seem able to find him in this crowd. Oh, there's Nesta. Come along, Angela. I want you to meet her. - That's my daughter. - Hello, sir. - Nesta, this is Angela. - How do you do? - See you all later. - I'm so glad you were able to come. It was very sweet of you to ask us. Not at all, but I'm sure you two would rather dance than talk to me. If you don't mind, I think I'd rather look for Jimmy. - Who's Jimmy? - Her husband, darling! They're depressingly fond of each other. - You never told me she had a husband! - He's one of my oldest friends. - My dance, I think. - Is it? Of course not. It's mine! Hey! You're going the wrong way. No, I'm sure they're not. - At last I've got you. - How do you mean, got me? - To myself, of course. - Why, so you have. What happens next? The most important moment of my life. Oh, I'm glad to be present for that. It couldn't very well have been otherwise. - That's lucky, isn't it? - It's more than lucky, it's... Darling, will you have the ring before you say yes or say yes before you have the ring? - What ring? - This one. - Darling... - Well? I think I'd like to say yes and have the ring and have you kiss me all at the same time! - I don't believe it's true. - Neither do I. - How do you feel? - Dizzy. Me too. - Sit down if you're tired. - I'm not tired. - Shall we dance, then? - Hello, Mrs Logan. - Haven't you a partner? - Yes, but I don't see him anywhere. - Perhaps we can find him. - Please don't bother. He's sure to turn up. He always does. - Ah, there you are. - Oh, hello. - That was frightfully rude of you. - What? You just passed Madame Labardi without saying a word to her. Did I? Good heavens, I've been trying to catch a glimpse of her all evening. Hello, Jimmy. I want you to meet my future wife. Jimmy Logan, Angela Labardi. - You're very lucky. How do you do? - Congratulations to you both. Thank you. We're going to break the news to Mummy. Have you seen her? - Very nearly. - She went to the drawing room. - Come along, Evelyn. - See you later. Ifwe're to catch that train to Florence, we'd better slip away. Oh, Mummy! Evelyn's asked me and I said yes. He gave me this and now I want to tell everybody! Angela! Darling! Hello, you two, I thought you were never coming. The best people are always late. Who is that? That's the dancing partner of Millie Fiske's, Sandro Barucci. Sandro Barucci? Mummy! I think she'll be all right now. The pulse is normal. She seems to be sleeping. - I advise you all to leave her. - Leave her lying there alone? Yes, I'd rather she wasn't disturbed. I should let her sleep until the morning. But I don't want to get married. You don't know the things that can happen. The amul things. All my life, I've tried to avoid the world. Now it's rushed in on me. ANGELA. What form did the illness take? Is it likely to come on again? Mever let me go, Guiseppe. Never let me go. MAN. Rosanna. Rosanna. Rosanna. Florence. - Return? - No return. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, sir! Quickly! What is it? What's the matter? What are you shouting for? Maddalena. - Where is she? - It's happened again. She's gone! Just like she did the last time. - And look, her jewel case. - What is all this shindig about? - Why, where's Mummy? - She's gone. - Gone? - This happened before, Angela. Daddy? I lost her for a whole year. The seven moons. Well, here's where I leave you. I wonder why artists always choose the worst parts of a town. The answer, my girl, is on the walls of every picture gallery in Europe. Ah! Get out of here! Get out, you scum! Devils! You gonna be all day plucking that fowl? Hey, mind what you're doing with those feathers. Quite the duchess, since Nino took you upstairs from the scullery! Stop flapping, you old fool. No, well, you never know. You may soon be back again. That's what you think. Me? I'm not like the others. Where I am, I stay! There's only one not like the others. Rosanna. When she left, they came and went. Came and went, as you will. Ah, shut up. Rosanna! Why has she come back? Rosanna! - Rosanna! - Nino! You're not like the others, eh? Where you are, you stay! - She can't do this to me. - Get back to the scullery, you! There seems to be a little trouble in the house over the way. - Nino's woman has returned. - The red-headed beauty who passed? - Yes, Rosanna. - If I asked her very nicely, do you think she'd let me sketch her? - You don't know Nino. - Who's Nino? Never heard of him. You're lucky. He has a bad temper and he's very quick with a knife. Well, he can't murder me for being polite to a lady in public. - No law against that, is there? - Here, Nino is the law. I see. Er... Thanks. I don't know what's happened to me. No other woman would dare treat me the way you do. Walking in and out of my life as though it were an open door. - You've never shut me out yet. - Mo... More fool me, perhaps. I nearly went mad those lastfour years. Was it four years? What does time matter? I only live when we're together. That's the same for me too. When you went away, I could have killed you. - Could you kill me now, Nino? - Yes. No. No, the madness has passed. Loving makes it easy to forgive. It seems as ifwe've been dead for four years. But we're alive now. Both of us. Wonderfully alive! But will it last? Or shall I wake up to find you gone like... like a puff of smoke in the night? Does it matter? Love like ours can't be measured by time. Nino, I've just remembered something. Look on the table. What? This? - What is it? - It's for you. For me? Rosanna! - You're pleased? - Pleased? I believe they mean more to you than I do. I love you when you laugh, Nino. It's like ice and fire. I love you! Then this is the third time she's disappeared? Yes. - When did she first leave you? - A few days after our marriage. - She was, as you know, very young. - A quarrel? Oh, of course not. I didn't even know she was unhappy. She stayed away how long? - Six months. - Tell me about the second time. It followed my sending Angela to England. - Maddalena was against that? - She wanted her to go to a convent. - You quarrelled? - How could anyone quarrel with her? No. She was hurt by my attitude. She seemed to draw away, within herself. And then, as before, she disappeared? And I blamed her for not writing to me. When she returned, still no clue? No. She asked why the dustsheets were over the furniture. And who had moved a vase of lilies that she had arranged that morning. That morning was a year before. Nothing to explain that symbol - the seven moons? Once in her sleep she cried out "Rosanna". "Rosanna ofthe seven moons. " But apart from that and the marking on the mirror... nothing. Then that's all we have to help us find her. Ifwe ever do. I'll leave him with you. Don't worry. Angela! I came as soon as I could get away. I don't know quite how to tell you this. My chief is sending me back to England on a special job. - Oh, Lyn, for how long? - Two weeks. Three at most. It would happen now, just when I need you. Father can't do anything. If Mother is to be found, it's up to us. - That's what I was thinking. - I tell you what. Why not advertise for some ofthat jewellery? The Cellini pendant, for instance. That's a grand idea. I'll advertise in every newspaper in Italy. And I'll take a plane back as soon as I'm through. Yes, please do. I'm going to need you. When you do, I'll be there. Don't worry too much, darling. It will all work out. - Nine on the ten, Nino. - Right. - He's coming out. - Yes, coming out. - We're all here, Nino. - Six on the five. Hmm. Are we gonna hang about while he plays cards with himself? Nino's the best judge ofthat. I came here to say something and I'm gonna say it now. Since when were you made spokesman? What's it matter who's spokesman as long as it gets itself said? We're not satisfied, Nino. Love's young dream's all very well so long as it doesn't interfere with business. It's her that keeps him here. He's afraid to let her out of his sight in case he loses her again. Vittoria, come here. - What were you whispering about? - I was saying you were all right. You forgot to make the bed this morning. Go and do it. Bed! That's about all you're fit for. All right, Scorpi, let's have it. Well, I've been thinking. We stood by you solid in the past but things are different since she came back. While you worked, there was no complaint. Even if your share was bigger than ours. But we're not satisfied to do all the work while you sit at home, smelling roses. You're doing fine, Scorpi. Go on. - I said all I want to say. - You said all you want to say, huh? Are you sure? You know, you're a useful fellow, Scorpi. In some ways. Many's a time our Scorpi's hands have been a great help. But Scorpi thinking? Scorpi using his head! Doesn't make sense somehow. Wait a minute. I'm wrong. We did use his head once. As a battering ram! Don't misunderstand me. I like you. I like you a lot. But you stick to using those. And don't use that! Nino! That wasn't friendly. Anyone else want to say anything? All right, then. Now, you listen to me. I've given up this small-time business. A purse here, brooch there. It's all you idiots are good for. Rosanna came back with more sparklers than you've seen outside a jeweller's window. That's the class of stuffwe're going to deal with in future. Big st - that's worth risking our necks for. But where we get it and when we get it is my affair, and you take your orders from me. Understood? All right, get out. All of you. Oh, Daddy, darling, I hate to see you just sitting here, holding the cross Mother gave you and looking so unhappy. I know, my dear. I'm sorry. Why don't you go away for a complete change? On a cruise, perhaps. One doesn't escape sorrow by running away from it. No. I think a better idea would be for you to go away. Would you mind if I did? Just for a little while? There's something I want to do. This morning, I had a letter about... - Mrs Fiske has called. - Mrs Fiske? - But it was Millie I expected. - If you don't mind, I'll go for a stroll. Visitors just now... Did you tell him you had a letter from Florence about the pendant? - I was just going to. - There you are, my poor child! Take these into the house, please, Tessa. - There isn't any news? - I'm afraid not. I'm most desperately sorry. Now, is there anything I can do? Anything at all? Everybody says it's a secret. But I'm sure you know me well enough to realise I'd never breathe a word. - Now, tell me, why did she run away? - We don't know. How very disappointing! I was hoping at least to get the truth from you. I've a bridge party this afternoon and it would've been so nice to... - Did Millie get my message? - Millie? Millie who? Oh, my Millie! No, she's gone to Monte Carlo to meet her ex-husband. I mean, her ex-father... my ex-husband. We had a row over that amul Sandro but I paid him and sent him away. Millie's gone away to console herself. Mrs Fiske, I've just been able to trace a bit ofjewellery of Mother's. I wanted Millie to come to Florence to make some enquiries. - How nice... - It may be the means of finding Mummy. - Could you come with me? - I? Good gracious, no! I'm offtomorrow to meet a dear friend, Mrs Brunswick. She's just got her divorce and that's always the critical period. So you see, I couldn't go to Florence because I shall be a week away in... - Did you say Florence? - Yes. That's just where I'm going. What a small world! I'll pick you up in the morning. - Pick that up. Put it down properly. - Don't be too hard on her, Nino. She'll be putting powdered glass on my spaghetti instead of cheese. - I think vitrum is more in her line. - She wouldn't go that far. Would you, Vittoria? Has old Bossi paid you yet for that jewellery you brought? - Not yet. - That stuff needs careful handling. - I'm seeing him this afternoon. - Has Rosanna told you where she got it? - No business of yours. - She takes a nice interest in our affairs! Perhaps you've got a reason for not saying. Perhaps you didn't steal it. Maybe somebody gave it you for something. - Nino! - Hello. Mother of mercy, look who's here! Sandro! - Sandro! - Well, well, you old cow! - It is good to see you again. - My son. My lovely boy. That's the sort ofwelcome to warm a man's heart. Hello, Nino. So the police haven't nabbed you yet. Hello... Another wanderer come back to the fold. Look at him. Silk next to the skin. And a suit that a prince would be proud to be buried in. Stop pawing me, Ma, and go and get me something to eat. Food for my son, you cheap slut! The best in the house. Lots of it. How's business, brother? Still content to pick up trifles in this... backwater? A bit above yourself, aren't you, since you danced your way into society in a hired dress suit? The only way you'd get in is through the window. Yes. But I'd bring out something to pay me for my troubles. I've danced more money into my pocket than you'll ever see. I was doing well with my last partner then, like a fool, I went and fell for a friend of hers. - Ah, this is something like! - Was the friend equally impressed? - Didn't get a chance to do my stuff. - Who was she? Angela Labardi. If I had three wishes, she'd be in every one ofthem. I was all set to try my luck at her birthday. Her mother threw a faint and ruined everything. - She was jealous perhaps. - No. Never met the woman. All I saw was her feet as they carried her upstairs. That's all I am likely to see. She disappeared during the night. Look out. This fellow mustn't see me. I'm sorry. - Phew, that was a near thing. - Who was he? An English artist I met in Rome. It would lower my stock if he found me in this rogues' gallery. - I'll show him we don't want artists round here. - No, I will. You're too rough. He'll give the quarter a bad name. No, I'm afraid I don't remember ever having seen that pendant before. Mr Bossi, the lady was positive she bought it from you. She may have done. Mine is a large business. You cannot expect me to remember things sold so long ago. What I really want to know is where did you get it from? It may have been an unredeemed pledge or perhaps one of my assistants bought it over the counter. But from whom, it would be quite impossible to say. - Then you won't help me? - My dear young lady, nothing would please me more than to help you but what can I do? Mr Bossi. I believe this pendant was stolen property. In that case, you'd better apply to the police, hadn't you? Good afternoon. - Ah! - Well? Yes, yes, things are going quite nicely. We've disposed of some ofthem locally but I'm still waiting to hear from Amsterdam about the more important ones... Come off it! I've heard that before. My dear fellow, it's no use being impatient. - These things take time... - Come on! Come on! Oh, well, perhaps a little on account. There. Thanks. Oh, goodness, how exciting. I never suspected you of being a female Sherlock Holmes. It's a frightful cheek inflicting my troubles on you but as you're such friends of Lyn's, I knew you wouldn't mind. Mind? Of course we don't mind. We're delighted, aren't we? Some ofthese San Gimignano types would do well for the New York gallery. - Whose idea was it to advertise? - Well, Lyn thought of it. But it seems to have led to a dead end. There was a bunch of beauties there who had to be seen to be believed. Was there? Never mind Jimmy. He's happy talking to himself like this. - What happened next? - Nothing. I showed him the pendant and he pretended to know nothing at all about it. - I'm certain he was lying. - I say, this is rather good. Come and have a look. Oh, Jimmy, what a pest you are! Yes, you're a clever brute even if you do talk too much. Heavens, look! There goes our dinner. Let's go out and get something we can eat. Come on, Angela. Haven't you any other clue except this jewellery? - Yes. The seven moons. - Let's have a look at this again. There you are. I copied it from the lipstick design Mother left. And once in her sleep, she spoke of Rosanna ofthe seven moons. - Is it the name of a place? - I'm counting on that. It's one ofthe reasons I came to Florence. I'll search it end to end. Wait a minute. There isn't a shadow of proof the seven moons is here. Why say a miserable thing like that? - There isn't. - I know. Mother spent most of her life here so it must be worth trying. You may be right but you can't go wandering about the slums without an escort. - I was longing for you to say that. - That's very sweet of you. It would be like the blind leading the blind. - I do know it a bit. - Angela! Excuse me. - My dearest Angela. - You know each other, don't you? - What brought you to Florence? - A perfectly ordinary train. I suppose you're trying to mend a broken heart. Oh, Millie! Don't mention that girl. It was a very lucky escape. - Where are you staying? - The Barbarelli. - With your friend, Mrs Fiske. - That old cockatoo! - She was very amusing about you. - Angela, I think we'd better see you home. - Won't you let me do that? - Yes, why not? - I believe you're the man I want. - You're always the one I want. Angela, don't let's trouble Mr Barucci. It's no bother. He'd love to. Good night. Thanks most amully. I'll be calling on you in a day or two. Come on, Sandro. Meeting you was a bit of luck. I don't like her going off with a nasty piece ofwork like that. - Nor do I. Waiter, bill, please. - Very good, sir. Did you happen to notice that ring he was wearing? That big, black affair? Couldn't miss it. Why? I have an idea I've seen it somewhere before. Quite recently. Where? That's just it. Where? - Do you know Florence well? - Like the back of my hand. How would you like to pilot me around? Angela! There's nothing I'd like better. - Taxi. - What did you do that for? It's a guide I want, not a lover. To the Barbarelli. Call for me tomorrow morning at the hotel. Good night. Who are you making yourself pretty for? Myself. I have no time for men. Only one. And he's out of reach and likely to stay there, even if he did amuse himselfwith you when there was nothing better about. If you loved Nino, you wouldn't have left him as you did. Who knows what I would or wouldn't do? Even I don't. You only come back when you're tired of your other lover. Have I another lover? Maybe. Maybe not. I live in the present. The past and the future mean nothing to me. One day, you'll go for good and Nino will want me again. As a drug perhaps to help him to forget. But I'm the only woman that will ever mean anything to Nino. Whether I'm here or not, Nino will always be mine. Mine. Do you understand? You better understand. Yours now, Rosanna, but for how long? Men are all alike, you know. Ever asked yourselfwhat you'd do if you saw him in another woman's arms, as I have? Don't be a little fool. I never shall. But supposing you did and he was kissing her face and her throat. - As he once kissed mine. - I'd kill him! I'd kill them both! But it isn't going to happen. It couldn't happen. Are you all right? I know who you are. You're the English artist. Yes. What are you doing here? It was here Nino found me years ago. I was lost and my mind was a blank. Found you? That accounts for it. Accounts for what? That you struck me as being different from the usual type ofwoman ofthe San Gimignano. They're just beasts, who love and hate and breed and die. - Are you married to this Nino? - No. I belong to nobody but myself. Why were you looking at the church just now as if afraid to go in? Nino hates churches, so I hate them too. Only fools pray! Was Nino the one who was sitting with you at the caf table or the one who was drunk? Nino's never drunk. It was his brother. You ask too many questions. I'm going. # Plainsong Hold me up! Hold me up! Don't let me kneel! Don't let me kneel! # Church organ Oh, dear. There's an amul lot of Florence left. Why don't you tell me what you're trying to do? - Trying to find my mother. - I don't know what she looks like. Tell me, do you know what this is? Mother left that sign behind before she disappeared. I believe that if I could trace that, I'd find her. - This reminds me of something. - Ofwhat? - I don't quite know. - Well, try to think. Let me keep it. I'll have some enquiries made. - Here is something to go on with. - Must you? - No, well, if you'd rather... - Well, perhaps you're right. - Present from your fianc? - Birthday present from Father. If you were mine, I'd cover you with jewels. Well, for the sake of your pocket, it's just as well I'm not. - There they are. - Hm? Afriend of yours. Mrs fiske. Angela! Come along, my dear. Mrs Brunswick is having things done to her face. Can't keep them waiting. I'm ready. Call me as soon as you get any news, Sandro. All right, see you later. Is there anything the matter with your hat that it doesn't come off? Because if any cutting is to be done, I'm the one who'll do it. What's this drawing got to do with her mother's disappearance? - Search me. - Who cares one way or the other? Ifthe little fool has got all this jewellery, bring her after dark. If she can't find anything, we will. I want more than jewellery from Angela Labardi. Pleasure before business. What a Romeo the boy is! Let's look at this paper, anyway. What's the idea of pretending you don't know what it is? - Look. - Sign of the seven moons. I had it copied for Rosanna. He doesn't even remember what's over his own front door. M1MO. How did the Labardi girl know about this place? I don't like it. She's just making a fool of him. No woman can make a fool out of me. - Not even you. - Oh, shut up. - Has she ever been here? - Of course not. Her mother left that sign before she disappeared. Doesn't make sense. I'm not sure I can't put this to some good use. Wait a minute, we're taking no chances. Until I've thought this over, the girl is to be told nothing. Who says so? What I choose to do with Angela Labardi is my business. - Be careful, brother. - Ofwhat? You run your show and I'll run mine. I've been trying to get Angela offthe beaten track for days. And now the chance has been given me. On a plate. Sympathy's all very well, Charles, but I've had more than I can stand. - Yes. - From morning till night it's the same thing. Letters, telephone calls, flowers as if she were dead. People stop me in the street and ask me if I've any news. Even at my club, there is no escape. I know it's ungenerous to talk like this but there's only one person whose sympathy meant anything to me and she's gone. - I'm clearing out, Charles. - Where are you going? Back to Florence. I'm opening up our old house there. I wired Angela this morning. Is Florence the wisest choice? Isn't it better to escape from memories than to invite them? It was there she came back to me before. Twice before. I see. I wouldn't like her to find an empty house. I want to talk to you. They're holding up their hands like children at prayer. - Who are? - Those spires. Rising out ofthe ugliness into the sky. Stop mooning about and listen to me. What do you know about the name "Labardi"? It's the girl's name. Sandro's girl. - Is that all you know? - Yes, that's all. When don't you tell the truth? Admit the jewels you brought belonged to Labardi. Did they? I don't know where I got them. Ah? Well, I do. Bossi told me and he's no fool. That pearl necklace with the emerald clasp was bought by Labardi three years ago in Genoa. He traced other pieces that belonged to him. What I want to know is this. How did you get those jewels from the Labardi house? How did you get them? Look at me and answer my... Rosanna! Rosanna... Rosanna! Why are you staring at me? What was the matter with you? I went on a journey. Somebody was calling me from a long way off. There's no-one here but ourselves. It was I who called. No, there's no-one here but ourselves. - I don't know what it could've been. - Hey, wait a minute. - Is this a trick? - A trick? Yes, to avoid answering my questions! I don't remember any questions. I was standing by the window... Rosanna, where did you go when you left me? Where do you go when you leave me? I can't tell you. - I don't remember. - Tonight you're going to tell me. I can't tell you, Nino. All that I've had to give, I've given you. Love, money, everything. Except the truth about where you go. I tell you, I don't know! Ifthat isn't enough, say so and I'll clear out! - No, Rosanna! - Then stop asking! Stop asking, will you?! What? Oh, a telegram! Father. He won't be arriving till after dinner. I should hope not. With none ofthe linen and halfthe silver unpacked? The only meal that anyone will get in this house is a piece of my mind. Oh, dear, that sounds very indigestible. I'll go. Get rid ofthose dustsheets. Hello? Who? Oh, Mrs Fiske. Yes. Yes, I just heard. He's coming after dinner. Thank you very much but I couldn't. The whole place is in a turmoil. I quite understand but you mustn't starve yourself. You'll keep your promise to dine with me at the hotel tomorrow? - It's Carnival night, you know. - Right you are. Oh, dear, that's the front door. I must go. Goodbye. There's a Mr Barucci to see you. He says it's important. - Hello. - Sandro. All right, Tessa. How on earth did you find me here? They told me at the hotel. Angela, I think our search is near its end. - You found the seven moons? - I know a man who knows where it is. - Where is it? Tell me. - It's not quite as easy as all that. From what he says, it seems that it's in rather a bad quarter ofthe town. I don't care where it is. Take me there. I'll go now. Not now but very soon. You see, this man's on the run. He never goes out except at night. Besides, unlike myself, he isn't doing this entirely for love. - How much does he want? - I suggested 1 O,OOO lire. - That's all right. - Well... As a matter of fact, I'm afraid he asked for more. - I don't mind. - Very well. I'll try and get in touch with him as soon as I can. - You'll come any time I send for you? - Of course. - Tomorrow, if it can be arranged? - Of course! Can I get you here on the telephone? Tonight, yes. Tomorrow I'm dining at the Hotel Barbarelli with Mrs Fiske. Good. Then if not here, there. I hope that neither of us will be disappointed. Oh, Sandro, when you see this man, will you ask him if he's ever heard of Rosanna ofthe seven moons? Why should I ask him that? I believe Rosanna had something to do with Mother's disappearance. If I hear anything, I'll let you know. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. That clear? Scorpi? Tabalo? Maccho? Yep. The job's tomorrow. Carnival night. Just after 12. To fool the police, we're all wearing the same kind of costumes. Understood? We all know the Labardi house, but is there anything in it? - The place has been empty. - Well, it's not now. That's all for the present. - Nino! - What do you want? You. And no listeners. Well, how do you like the new setup, Scorpi? I'd like it better if I knew how we'd get into the house. We can use that thick head of yours as a battering ram. Why, you! Don't be a blind fool. Angela knows that Rosanna was mixed up in her mother's disappearance. That's a lie. When we spoke of her, Rosanna hadn't even heard the name. So she says. You were fool enough to believe her. There's not much mystery now why Madame Labardi left her husband. There was another woman. The thing's as clear as day. Rosanna didn't steal those jewels. Labardi gave them to her. And he didn't give them to her for nothing. - Ifthat's true... - You know it's true. There's a change in the plans. I'm going into the Labardi house alone. I've a private reckoning with Labardi. When that's settled, the rest is yours and I want no part of it. Well, what are you waiting for? You've had your orders. Get out. Get out! Sandro. If you want to bring that girl here for any purpose of your own I won't stop you. - You can work in with us. - But if she sees Rosanna... She won't see Rosanna or any other woman here tomorrow night. Right. Well, you're done for. One rat less in the world. What is it, my son? You have murder in your eyes. What is it, Nino? She's broken my heart, that's all. Rosanna? All those years she was lost to me, she spent with another man. Didn't you spend them with other women? What if I did? It was her I loved. You doubt her love for you? Of course, he was a gentleman. He was rich, gave her jewels, money. I'm... Yet in spite ofthat, she came back to you. Fair's fair, my son. I have no great love for Rosanna. But I had a gypsy mother and I have enough ofthe clear bright in my veins to know the true from the false. I'd trust her love for you before all the proof in the world. If she loves me, Mother, why did she leave me? Who am I to say? Rosanna's a mystery. Always was. - I doubt if even she could solve it. - She says she doesn't know. - Can't remember. - Isn't that your answer? Maybe there's a wondrous curse on the girl. A call she has to answer. Call? Somebody calling, she said, from a long way off. Isn't that where your vengeance lies? Yes... Yes! Mother, I want to believe in her. I must! Without her, I'm lost. Then take those knives out of your eyes, my son. For it's in your own heart you'll be driving them. What am I to do, Mother? What am I to do? Take her away somewhere for a little while. Be alone. You'll see. - Wondering where we are? - Yes, although I... The last time we were here, we came to that gap in the wall. - Nino, it's the old garden. - So you hadn't forgotten? But everything is so changed. The grass and the trees are taller. - It seems so deserted. - Deserted. And forgotten. Like a man whose woman has left him. Look, Nino, it was here I picked you a rose and had to stoop for it. Now the briars are above our head, out of reach. Lift me up, Nino. Never let me go again, Nino. Never let me go again. Why should you go? Why did you ever go? Rosanna, why did you leave me? I don't know. I know I never wanted to. Well, after tonight, there'll no longer be any reason for you to. Why do you say "after tonight"? I have to deal with something that has stood in our paths too long. - You're going into danger. - Maybe. - What kind of danger? - It's best you shouldn't know. - I shall go with you. - No. You must stay in your room till I return. Things will be going on you're best out of. - If you don't come back... - Oh, I shall come back. - If you're not waiting... - I promise. Don't look so worried. Smile for me. Come on, smile. That's better. Nino! Play our song for me. Hello! What are you doing here? # Rosanna # Lovely rose of my heart # Rosanna # Must we meet but to part? # This love I feeljustfor you is as real as the stars that shine # You hold a spell though your eyes never tell me you're really mine # Rosanna # When I dream you are near # Rosanna # Like a dream you appear # I know the kiss of a willo-the-wisp # Till my heart has flown # You're gone and I'm alone... What is it? What's the matter? You're trembling. Something cold went past me. The ghost ofthis old garden perhaps. - There are no ghosts in this garden. - Oh, yes, there are. Ladies and gentlemen who used to walk here when the beds were bright with flowers and the lawns were smooth and green. Hmm! That's all very fine but I much prefer it this way. Oh, so do I, because it's so wild. It's broken the shackles that once made it neat and tidy. - Why can't we stay here for ever? - I wish we could. There's work to be done. - We'll come back another day. - Shall we? How can we be sure? For all we know, this may be the last time we ever lie on this bank with the roses bending down to look at us. Don't talk like that! Don't say such things! - Ifyou love me... - I do love you, Nino. If only I could believe that. Now can you believe me? And that's the explanation, Guiseppe. It must be. It answers everything. You're asking me to believe that Maddalena has a dual personality? - She's living two separate lives? - Yes. In the one, she has no knowledge ofthe other. We know very little ofthe workings ofthe human mind. You see, something happened to split her mind in two. Maybe a shock during her childhood. By your own showing, it was always after a period of mental strain. That's true. When things became too much for her, she broke away from all ties, all mental torments, and took refuge in her other self. A door in her mind closed and another opened. Well, how do I look? Wonderful. But I thought there was something you had to do. There is... later on, but I shall do it none the worse for wearing this costume. Well, wish me luck. - Don't forget your promise. - I'll wait here till you come back. Aren't you going to kiss me goodbye? - What is it, Sandro? Any news? - That man will see us. At once. - That's wonderful, but I'm going to dinner. - Hurry or we'll miss him. What about Mrs Fiske? Can't you say you've had a message from Nesta Logan, that she's ill? I suppose that will do. I'll tell the reception to give her a message. Why, Nino, how wonderful you look. Look, you needn't serve here tonight. Go out and enjoy yourself. Won't you go with me? Think what fun we had last Carnival. Remember? Come on. Ah, I've other things to do. - Nino, please. - I don't want any women here tonight. # Plainsong - What an amul place. - Isn't very grand, is it? There's a table. Let's sit down, shall we? - Well, where is the man? - He doesn't seem to have arrived. - I'll order some wine. - I'd rather coffee. Waiter, bring me a Cognac. - Some coffee for the lady. - Yes, sir. If I'd known it was going to be like this, I wouldn't have come. Don't worry. I can look after you. He said he'd be here at ten, he must have got held up by the procession. I see. Drink your coffee. Don't worry. - Hello, Evelyn. - Hello. Got back sooner than expected. - What's wrong with Nesta? - Nothing that I know of. Why? Is there supposed to be? I can't make this out. Didn't you send a message to Angela saying you were ill and asking her to come at once? - No, we haven't seen her for days. - But Mrs Fiske told me that... - I can't understand it. - Who delivered the message? A slim, dark bloke, they said. He'd been to the hotel with Angela before. That sounds like Sandro Barucci, but a message from us? Nonsense. What the devil does he want? She had some idea he might help her in locating her mother. - I don't like it. - Meaning you don't like him. - I nearly punched his nose once. - Why didn't you? Didn't like that knuckle-duster he always wears. - Knuckle-duster? - A ring like a chunk of coal. Good Lord, so that's who it was. Remember my telling you about that gang of cutthroats in San Gimignano? - That's him. If he took her there... - Jimmy! - Do you know where it is? - Of course. - Then to hell with all this, let's get a move on. - Right. Let's go. Good luck! - What's he doing that for? - He's shutting up. Why doesn't the man come? I can't stand this waiting. He won't be long now. Nice stuff, Sandro. Come on, boys, let's get out of it. Ever asked yoursemwhat you'd do if you saw him in another woman's arms? M1MO. Stay in your room till I return. Things will be going on you're best out of. V1TTOR1A... and he was kissing herface and her throat, as he once kissed mine. Well, what do you want? Go on, get out! Nino? So that's what he meant. I wouldn't be in so much of a hurry if I were you. - Don't be a fool. You're not wanted in there. - Take your hands off me! I said you wouldn't last for ever and I was right. You're finished! Nino's in there with another woman! - I tell you, I sawthem. - You lying little... Let me go! Rosanna! Sandro! Rosanna! Where is Maddalena? What have you done with my mother? Angela... Mummy! Mummy, darling! Mummy... Lyn, come quickly. Angela! - Mother is... - Hush, darling, we'll look after her. Get a doctor at once. Dr Ackroyd's at Labardi's now. We must take her there straightaway. - Have you seen Nino? - Yes, he went towards the square. - Rosanna. - What's happened? Something amul. Rosanna! - Where's Rosanna? - They took her to Labardi's. Labardi's?! You haven't much time. I'm afraid she won't last much longer. Now, my dear child, are you ready to make your peace with God? Yes, Father. I've sinned so much, Father. My child, you were in the dark. You couldn't see. Now thank God for this good confession, and for your holy penance, say one Hail Mary and make a good act of contrition. - Jesus have mercy. - Please. - Lord have mercy upon her. Christ have mercy on her... Lord have mercy upon her. Go forth, O Christian soul, out of this world in the name of God, the Father Almighty, who created thee... Goodbye, Maddalena, my beloved wife. The memory ofour life together will always be with me. I wish I'd made you happier. Forgive me. Goodbye, Rosanna.
