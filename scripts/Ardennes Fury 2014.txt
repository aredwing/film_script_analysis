We're getting our asses kicked here, Lance! We have to hold the line till phase two of the aerial bombing, and we can't even get in the fight! Afternoon ain't coming soon enough! Long as we're long gone before then! Sarge, we can leave anytime you give the word! I hate to say it, but I'm with CK on this one. We need to advance to the rear and regroup! Negative, Sergeant Rose! Move up! Move up! We hold them here! Move! Move! Move! Get on your feet! We push through until air support comes! Aw, for hell's sake! We're surrounded by Nazis! Doesn't matter if we go forwards or backwards! McNay, get us around those tanks over there! You copy? Copy that, Sarge! We're mighty low on fuel! We don't get around those tanks, fuel's gonna be the least of our concerns! Copy that. Come on! Does anything on this tank work? Gunner's always ready and willing! Oh, well, let's just take out those tanks and keep advancing, okay? We got one ahead! Rose and I will take it out! Rest of you, sit tight! Watch our six! Sergeant Lance Dawson playing hero again. This thing goes sideways, you keep this thing moving. You don't stop rolling till you see friendly faces or Saint Peter's gates. Copy that! Well, at least this crate's not a burnin' Sherman. - Let's do this! - You'd better be quick. It looks like we're going to get some rain. Plan, Sarge? The basic rodeo roundup. I'll go to the left. You catch 'em on the right. I've known about the rodeo roundup since the 761st, Sergeant Dawson. Any problems there, Sarge? Never a problem! I just want to be able to see my wife and kids again just like you! We don't have any kids! Not for lack of trying! Let's go! Hey the Rain's letting up, let's go! Oh, hey. Good to see you guys. - Miss us? - Ah, getting bored. Ready? Move her out! Back to American lines! Forward ho, Sarge! Lance, we're cut off from the column. Freddy, how we doing? We're mighty low on fuel! Let's get as far as we can! Well, you guys better hit the ground! Now, soldiers, we're well over enemy lines, so get into tank formation, and be on the lookout. Keep your eyes peeled for the enemy! Piece of junk! Looks like we're all clear. For now. Well, I guess that's the end of that. Can it, Private. Bad news, Lance. We're dry. Yeah, Sarge? Where's that fuel point, Private? Radio confirmed a supply truck about a kilometer east of us, stationary. All right. We'd better get a move on, then. Frulein. Hey. Take him out. Rose, mission first. Then check the girl. Shit. No go! We're gonna have to carry it! Are you okay? We got company coming! We gotta go! Come with us! Come on! Come on! Let's go! For once, I'm glad to see you guys can't follow orders. Sergeant McNay thought you could use some help. He was right. Private Sommers, let's make this quick. Turret's jammed, and the breach is stuck again! Griffin, get these cans back there. Get this beast fueled up. Freddy! Hey! Get this thing fueled up! You get this beast moving! Let me get the radio! Freddy! Give me a hand clearing this damn thing! Almighty, Almighty, this is 3-6 Actual requesting air support. Over! 3-6, this is Almighty. Negative on air support. Maintain radio silence now forward. 3-6 Actual. Out. Copy that, Almighty. Out! Another minute, Sarge! Freddy. All right, listen up! We have to move to rally point two ASAP. When we get there, we're gonna stay put and maintain radio silence. - You speak English? - I do. What's your name? - Sister Claudette. - Sister? Are you hurt, Sister Claudette? No, where do we go? We're going to a military rally point, where you'll be relocated. You're safe as long as you're with us. I must get back! Calm down, Sister. Hey, get down! Watch the fire, Griff! Sommers, we don't have that much time. 30 more seconds, Sarge! The children, they need me! Children? What children? I run an orphanage with Mother Mary Ellen. There... There are many orphans! They must be saved! I... I live with the children. Kids? What kind of nun has kids? Nuns run orphanages, you dumb-ass! Orphans, yes! I must go! Hey! Hey! You can't make it back to the orphanage by yourself! I don't know how you got this far alone. I had an American escort. American escort? They were executed by the Germans. Freddy, give me the map! Watch... Keep your head down! Hey. We're here. Where's your orphanage? Uh... Here? Rose, that's three clicks east. Rally point's five clicks north! Almost there, Sarge! We don't have a lot of time to get to that rally point. We're already a kilometer off-course. Three clicks east, pick up a bunch of kids, then hike back to here, plus another five clicks north, and that's pretty shaky ground, Sarge. Rose, what if we go straight there? Well, we got a... a chance of making it to the rally point before the bombs fall. Chance? What kind of chance? A slim one! But it's... it's better than the chance that those kids have making it through the operation. One more can! One more can, Sarge! One more can! We can't risk it. - I'm sorry, Sister. - No! Sarge, Sarge, I don't think you heard me. I heard you just fine, Sergeant. I said a slim chance, you know, but... Yeah, I'm aware of that, Sergeant! Well, holy shit! I'm with the Sarge on this one! What did your father used to always say? If you're gonna die, you might as well go ahead and die... Doing the right thing, yeah. And in my eyes, this is the right thing. I usually back your play, but look at her! This is not a damn vote at the Rotary Club, Sergeant! What you're saying could get us all killed, kids included! I say we get the kids! At least give 'em a chance to make it through the operation. Look, they may not be our kids, but they're someone's kids. All right, that's it! Good to go! Traversing! Put your head down. Put your head down. Get ready! Lance, you better cover your ears! Firing! Clear! Freddy, you get this beast to the rally point. You gotta be kidding me! Am I the only one thinking straight here? Look, I feel for those orphans, I really do, but you said it yourself. We barely stand a chance of making it in one piece now. I don't see how having these kids die with us is gonna help. Now, look, Sarge, I know that you got a lot on your plate... CK, Rose, Griffin, we'll be on foot. Hey, we'll be able to hit a few of these rough shortcuts you can't navigate through, all right? We pick up those kids, we'll come out here. That's right along the route. Give us one hour. If we're not there, you keep this beast moving, and you don't stop till you hit that rally point. I'm not leaving you, Lance. That's an order, soldier. Copy that. Rose, you take point for now. Sister, show him the way. All right. We'll be looking out for you, Sarge! You better be! If the Krauts don't get us, Dawson will. Come on, Griff. Griff! Back me up on this one. FIGMO. Hey, look, uh, Sarge, um, how we know she ain't leading us into some kind of trap? That sounds pretty unlikely, Private. I... I just ain't buying it. I mean, what the hell's a nun doing out here, anyway? She don't even sound French. I just ain't buying it. CK, if it is a trap, it's a pretty weak one. Get back in formation. Sergeant's right, CK. We're behind enemy lines. We're trapped already. I wouldn't expect to see any friendly faces anytime soon. We still need to do this, Sarge? They may not be our kids, but they were someone's. You should have been more cooperative, shouldn't you? I lost six good men, friends! Because your brother helped the Americans, he is now dead! I want to know everything he told you about the American plans. But I... I do not know. H-He never told me anything the American spies told him. You lie! No! No, it is the truth! He never told me anything! I think you lie. No, no! I don't know! I don't know! Tell me everything! No, no. This is my family. This is my family! No! No! I find you peasants hard to believe. No, it's true. No, my family. No! Now... tell me of the American plans. I want to know now! That's not too far from here, Sarge. Hey, no matter what happens, stay here. Stay low. - No, I must... - Ehp! Ehp! You stay here. Wait for me. No! This is what you get for helping the Americans. I want to know everything they told your brother. I know nothing! - And I want to know now! - Nothing! Nothing! Sarge, we got a problem here. Jesus. Rose, clear the front so we can get to that officer. CK, take out that vehicle. Nothing! I could take the first one, but the officer's too close to the woman. Ah, shit. We got dead civilians out there. Some of 'em are kids. I see it. Take him, Rose. Wilco. Hold your fire! We have you surrounded! Your vehicle is disabled! Surrender now! We have a woman in here, a civilian, an innocent woman! Come out with your hands up! You send the woman out without any further harm, I promise that you and your men will be treated as prisoners of war in accordance with the Geneva Convention! Sarge, I say we fill that house full of lead while we still got the chance. Just sit tight, soldier. They've got a grenade on her, Rose. Let the woman go! Let the woman go now! Your nine! Officer's heading into the woods! Hold your fire, CK. Ah, shit! Jesus. Secure the area now! Hey, we got a survivor, Sarge! All clear! Goddamn animals. Hey. Hey! Want some water? Wasser? Come here. How you doing, soldier? Some more? Aw, come on! Hey, want some more? It's all right. There you go. What the hell are you doing, Private? Stand down! I said stand down! CK. Don't. Hey. Hey. Hey! I don't know how you did things over in the Pacific. But over here, we don't butcher helpless, unarmed soldiers, even if they're the enemy, before we've had a chance to ask them some questions and get some intel! We should have killed 'em all when we had the chance. Think the kids might have appreciated that? Or even our dear sweet Sister? Huh? Heh. Screw your head on tight, soldier! Want to save your goddamn kids or not? I told you to stay put. We have to go, Sister. We must bury them. There's no time to bury the dead. I'm sorry. They're in God's hands now. Let's go save your kids. Major, what about the Americans? They're most likely an advance squad in preparation for their up-and-coming operation. I want to capture one of their commanders. I need to know what their objectives are, how many men and when. We need more of our men, Gretsch. It's been a long time since I've had to travel this far on foot. Are you going weak on me, Gretsch? Like the Fatherland? Like the Fatherland, are you turning weak on me?! In this time of crisis, we need all the intelligence we can get! And if we need to walk, we will walk! Unless you would care for me to end the war for you right here, right now! You can sleep for the rest of it and forever. Do you want that, Gretsch? No, Major. Good. It's one of ours. Are you going to help them? Sarge, CK and me can get down there. Too far away. We can't. I know. It's our own guys! Sarge! It's over. Let's get those kids. Griffin... take point. Come on, Lance. Where are you? I don't think they're gonna make it back. Sarge says we stay, we stay. Well, I say we go. What do you think, Gunderson? Heh. Thanks a lot for the support. We're not taking a vote on this! The Sarge says we stay, we stay. He's got an hour to get back. Why don't you make yourself useful and do a perimeter check? Be back in an hour. Redeal. You are surrounded. Shit. Drop your rifle. Now. Good morning, Private. We need to have a talk about your operations, hmm? Private Scott Sommers... Now... your up-and-coming operation, what's the objective? Private Scott S... Now, Private, how old are you? 18? 19 perhaps? 19? See?! We can communicate! Indeed, a young man. I've lost many young men, 15-year-old boys, to soldiers just like you. You see, you will tell me everything you know about your operations, or I will cut pieces of you until you do. God! The operation, what is your objective? Tell me! An hour and 10. Sommers has been gone too long. I need to go check on him. No, sir. Someone needs to hold this tank, and that someone's you. Roger that. I'm going anyway. Uh, Freddy, we got a problem. What? You see something? Holy shit! They're not gonna miss once they get that close! Gonna get an A.P. Get a good mark! Mark set! Fire! Okay, this mission's FUBAR. I don't even think Kilroy's been here. We should talk about this later. Amerikaner! How many grenades do we have? One! One! Light 'em up! Come on! Come on! Come on! Move, move, move, move! All right, let's go! Come on! He was a member of an American tank crew. They have their tank near here. Sadly, he did not elaborate as to where. He knew nothing of their plans. Shall we find the tank? I don't give a damn about their tank. I want the tank commander. And thank you to our newfound friend in there, our late friend, I know where they went. Doesn't look like an orphanage to me. Oh, thank God. It's ours. Who here is in command? That would be me. And now it will be me. Turn this thing around. Everybody out! See, children? I told you your mother would return safe. Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! She's their mother? Let's talk. It's time for the truth. Those kids called you Mama. I am Sister Claudette. I don't think so. You ain't French, and this ain't no orphanage. I think you're a desperate mother who'd do anything to save her kids, and you suckered us in here. I am not a nun. I am from Portugal. My husband was an American ambassador, and we almost escaped. No more lies! And what about Sister Mary what's-her-name? She is a real nun. Uh-huh. She has been our savior. And this, uh, orphanage? No orphans. I'm not gonna get my men wrapped up in this matt... Get down! Rose, you see anything? Not yet! Pinned in a goddamn orphanage with goddamn nuns and kids. Private Griffin, you okay out there? Fine, Sarge! Just enjoying the view! Coming your way! Grenade! Shh. It's okay. It's okay. It's a hell of a time to pull a John Wayne move, you stupid bastard! Shut up. There's no need for any further bloodshed! Sounds like that Kraut officer that killed those kids. Griff, can you move? I... Hurts pretty bad, but I can move. Okay. If you surrender now, I assure you that you will be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention! Oh, bullshit. Claudette, get the kids ready to move now. I say we stand and fight, Sarge! It's not your call, Private! If you are concerned for the lives of the children, I promise you they will be treated well if you come out now and surrender! We're wasting time. CK, damn it. That's enough, soldier. It's not too long till the operation's bombs start falling. Grenaden. Schnell! Pierre! Pierre! Stop! Stop! Stay with Amelie. I will protect Pierre. Nuts. Claudette, you and Sister Mary get those kids ready to go now! Okay. CK, you go with those kids! Pierre has run away! Aw, come on! You gotta be kidding me! Do it! All right, let's go! Come on. Let's go! Move, move, move! Move, move, move, move! Come on. Pierre! - Come on! - Pierre! Pierre! Sarge, Griffin's been hit! Come on! Come on! Ahh! Pi... Pierre! Pierre! Pierre! Pierre! Shut up. Shut up, lady! The Krauts are gonna hear you. Pierre went in the woods. Stop him, please. Find him! H-He's just a boy. He's just a boy! Oh, Pierre! Oh, God, Pierre. God in Heaven. Pierre. Ohh. CK! CK, get your ass back here now! I could follow him! Negative! We gotta go! CK knows where the tank is, all right? He'll have to catch up. You get Griffin, and you follow me, all right? - Pierre! - Shhh. Sister, listen. We can't run fast enough, all right? CK will find the boy. He'll save your son. I promise. - Gotta go. - Go. Move, move, move, move, move! - Let's go. - Go, go. Move, move, move, move! Move. Move. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Kid, what the hell's the matter with you? Come on now, kid. Come on now. Hey... there's no need for that, all right? Oh, no, no. Come on. Ah, stupid! We will find Pierre soon, okay. - Damn. - Sir! Sir! I'm fine, Sergeant! I'm fine. Just... Just a minor misstep. Let's take a minute and catch our breath. Said... I said I'm fine. We're a few clicks east of the tank. - CK... - Will be fine, or they won't. We've got a bigger immediate problem. Griffin's not doing well. Right. We don't have the time or the manpower to go back. CK and the boy. It's not good. No. No. No. No! No! No! Oh, God. No. No. No. My baby. No. No. No. No. Where were you? Where were you?! Where were you?! Claudette, quiet. Sarge... She's quiet, or we're dead. My baby! Shh. Private... German bullet. I let my guard down. Rose, you and Griffin get them. Get out of here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. We gotta go. We're gonna have to bury the kid shallow. That should have been for me. That kid just... He just... Let's just get this kid buried quickly. A.P. loaded! Up! Fire! Yeah! Yeah! Ha! Reloading! Load it up! Quick! Do those help, Sister? Heh. I never been much for religion. Starting to figure maybe I should start thinking about it. Thank you. Merci. Mercy? Mer-ci. Uh... thank you. - Merci. - Oh. Heh heh ho ho ho. Merci. Hey, CK, looks like I finally got one thing right in my sorry-ass G.I. life. Doesn't seem like a necessary firefight, Sarge. Let's find another route. We have to get to the tank. This is the quickest route. None of us are in a position to fight right now. We could find another way around. Might take a little longer, but... How much longer? About 20 minutes. That's time we don't have. That's time Griffin doesn't have. CK, you get Griffin and the civilians. Take 'em about 20 meters in the woods. You hide 'em as best you can. Then you get your ass back here ASAP. He's right, Sarge. We got no chance of making it through. Let me draw fire. You guys get the civilians through. Griffin, I am not sending a wounded man out to get cut down. It's for the best, Sarge. Griff, you been losing a lot of blood. You don't know what you're saying. It's the only way, and you know it. You all know it. No. We stick to my plan, and you go on my signal. Move out. All right, let's go. Come on. Come on. Griff, you're with me. Griff, let's go. All right. Hey, keep your eyes open. I gotta go for a bit. Buddy, I need you to keep breathing. All right? Now hey. Hey. All right, now you see a Kraut helmet, you just start shooting, all right? All right. All right. Yeah. - Hey, CK? - Yeah? Get the hell out of here. Can't you see I got civilians to save? You Okie son of a bitch. All right, you wait here for me. You copy me? FIGMO. I copy, man. I copy. You stay here. Wait here. It's okay, Amelie. It's okay. Just look at the lights playing through the trees. Look how beautiful they are. The hell with this. Monsieur. Damn it. Get the civilians. That was Griffin. Yeah. All right, let's go. Come on. Come on. Let's go. On the double. Griff. Griff ain't there, Sarge. Gotta get to that tank, soldier. That's him, Sarge. We gotta back him up. He's saving our ass right now. Let's not let that go to waste. Let's move. Amerikaner! Amerikaner! Amerikaner! Hande hoch! Hande hoch! Hande hoch! Hande hoch, Amerikaner! Well, what do you know, Sarge? Looks like I had one extra after all. The operation's breathing down our backside, Gunderson. Only one real round left, Freddy. I don't like the sound of that. You finally get to use Stella. Load her up. Run like hell. Gunderson, back inside now! Hey, let's take a minute and switch off. Rose, stand guard. CK, with me. Thank you, Sergeant. My daughter needs a rest. Get down. Get down. On the double, soldier. Are you on board with the mission at hand? I'm sorry Griffin and that kid died, I really am, and I need you thinking straight. Do your duty. Griffin did his duty. This kid is safe. We're done, hmm? Sir? Don't call me sir! I work for a living. You need to get your shit together, because you are compromising my team. We should have been at the rallying point an hour ago, but we ain't, 'cause of them. They're the compromise. We are soldiers! That is our job! That what you're gonna tell yourself when you're thinking about killing Griffin and this whole team? Listen here, you son of a bitch! - Yeah! Yeah! - Leave it be! Clock's a'tickin'! We need to get moving now. CK, on point. Yes, sir. There are many tracks on the road, and now this. They're still nearby, Herr Gretsch. Major? We are looking... for an American G.I., a woman and some children. Our lines are nearby. We can use some more help. Ja, Major. Y'all have to come see this. Some kind of Nazi scarecrow. Check it out. Sniper in the woods! You are one lucky son of a bitch. Tell me about it. Rose, get up here, and get me eyes on that shooter! You see him? A couple yards to the right of that scarecrow! Ain't wearing a uniform. There are poachers in these woods. They will shoot either side. They do not care where a bounty is from. Think I see him. Got a shot? All right, we're gonna have to... gonna have to go around this field, use those trees for cover. It's gonna cost us. That tank'll be a sight for sore eyes. A.P. loaded! Up! Fire! Yeah! Yeah! Come on, Sarge. Hurry up. CK, you remember Omaha? Man, I never thought I'd have to do another Omaha. You're gonna do an Omaha! With gravy? No gravy! We're out in the open. - Freeze! - Freeze! - Freeze! - Freeze! - Freeze! - Hold it! Ah, hell. I know that sound! Who was it? Which one? Who? Go. Take her. Be safe. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! All right, do not move! Don't move. What are you doing? No! Do not move! Don't! Stop! Stop! All right. All right, you're gonna do that. You're gonna walk right to me. Take it slow honey. - Slow down. - Go to CK. - Don't move. All right. Slow down. Easy. Slow down. Stay calm. God be with you. All right, take small steps. Just right here. Now, when you get here, you're just gonna hand her right over to me, okay? I'm right here. Right here. I'm gonna take her from you. Just slow down. Slow down. Nice and easy. Nice and easy now. All right, I got her! I got her! Oh, God. What the hell are you doing? I'm getting my way into Heaven by saving a nun. We both know that's a mine out there. Hey, can't let you do that. The hell you can't. Lance, take care of the kid. Maybe it was just a dud. Maybe I can still get her off. Nathan! Look... Good. It's settled. I'm so afraid, so very afraid. Be strong, Mother Mary! I wasn't expecting to be visiting our Father so soon. Oh, Mother. We gotta go. We gotta get to a safe distance. - Move, Sister! - All right. No! Come on. - Move! - No! - Come on. - No! You know, normally, Sister, I'm not a praying man. I promise you I'll do my best for you. I seem to remember my... my Catholic friends. It's a prayer. Hail Mary, full of Grace. Bless you, my son. Heh. Amelie, come back! Sarge, we got a problem here! He's gone, Sarge! Amelie. Baby. Amelie! Amelie! Ohh! Where are you? Oh, Amelie. Amelie! Amelie! Halt! Raus! Raus! Amelie! Amelie! American commander! I have something you want! American commander! I know you are out there! Sarge, he's gonna do it. You know. You saw what he did back there. Yeah, I know. I propose a trade! Come on now! We have no time to waste! No. We've already lost one kid today. Let's not lose another one. You hear this? These are my men, and they are closing in! It would be a shame if I had to kill these people so you could go on playing soldier! The clock is ticking! Ticktock! Show yourself! Let her and the kid go. You are alone? Yes. Are you, now? So... you're a liar. How could I possibly keep my word to a liar? Don't touch her! I'll kick your teeth through the back of your neck! Greetings, Sergeant. We need to talk about your upcoming operation. Staff Sergeant Lance Dawson, United States Army. Serial number DL3268. Yes, you are. Earlier today, I met one of your young privates. Tank soldier. Didn't know much about your plans. He did tell me what he knew... eventually. But you, you are a commander. You know all your plans, and you will tell me everything I need to know. Staff Sergeant Lance Dawson, United States Army. Shh. - You... - Serial number DL3268. This means something to you. Your father's, grandfather, family? Hmm? It's very nice. Sergeant, you will tell me everything I need to know, sooner or later. Staff Sergeant Lance Dawson, United States Army. Ohh. Stop that. Serial number DL... Gretsch! Now you're going to tell me about your plans. Staff Sergeant Lance Dawson... We need to know units. - United States Army. - I want to know. I want places. I want numbers... Serial number DL326... - an objective... You are not telling me what I want to know! Service number 375... Idiot! Aah! Gretsch! Stop playing. The American passed out. Bring me this one. Ja, Major. And these two in 10 minutes. Going to clean up. Ja, Major. Leave them alone. You smell pretty, Frulein. Leave them out of it, you coward. Gretsch, now! Schnell! Jesus! He needs water! Sarge. - You don't look so good. - Get back! You look like you could use some mashed potatoes. With gravy. Yeah. I am glad to see you. Yeah. Sorry about that, boss. Hey, you know how to drive this thing? Sergeant Rose taught me everything I know about driving, so yeah. All right. All right. Now, how do I start this thing? Scheisse. - Bring me mein Panzer! - Schnell! We'll take the shortcut. Where... Where are we going? As far away from here as we can get, toward American lines. We have to get out of here before these bombs start falling. Schnell! Schnell! Shit. God. I'm out of ammo. CK, does this thing go any faster? Might not matter if the airdrop's on time. We gotta find some cover. All right. Check under the blanket! Mommy, I'm scared. Slow down! Slow down! So this is your operation. Ah, nuts! Faster, CK! Sarge, I think the fuel tank took a hit, 'cause we are losing petrol fast! We need to outrun that tank, or it's gonna plow right over us! I'll get us as far as I can, but, uh... That ain't good. There it is! I see American flags one click ahead! Ah, ah, no! No, no, no, no, no! Come on, baby! Not now! We try to coast, that tank's gonna run right over us. We can make a run for it if we stop! Copy that! - Help them down. - Come on. Come on, honey. We gotta get a move on CK. Operation's Big Bombs are going to drop any second. Come on. Come on. Come on. Scheisse. CK, we lost Claudette! Take her. I'm going back. I'll meet you at the rally point. Yes, Sergeant! Claudette! No! Looks like we both lose... you Nazi son of a bitch. At least I get to watch you die! Aah! Hey. Claudette! Hey! Amelie... where is... CK has her. Get up. Okay. Come on. It is too late. Probably. - Come on. - All right. Come on. Come on. You can make it! Come on, Sister. Come on. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Hey, get down. Sarge! Sarge! Hey. Hey. Sarge? Sarge? You still with me? Come on now. Stay with me. Staff Sergeant Freddy McNay! What happened to y'all? We got ambushed back there, Sarge! It got too hot! Had to get out of there! You're too late, of course. Probably! Whoo! This is the final part of Operation Ardennes Fury, Sarge... bombs, tanks, and one last push across this damned forest! We're gonna blast those Nazi mothers with everything we got all the way to Berlin! We're close to base camp, Lance. I'm gonna... I'm gonna get some rest now. Negative. Negative, Sergeant! This is no time for laying down on the job! You read me? Are you giving me orders now, Private? You stay alive, Sarge, I'll sign those court-martial papers myself. Okay. Oh, Amelie! Thanks for saving us back there. What time you got? Doesn't matter.
