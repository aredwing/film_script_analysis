(whispering) Something great happened. - What did it happen? - I fell in love. - Of me? - No, of her. - Why are you whispering? - She doesn`t know that. - Shall I tell her? - No, you`re too ugly. Bye. We`ve arrived, this is Trevi`s Fountain. - It`s beautiful! - You are beautiful. - Thanks. If you wish to come back to Rome, devi gettare you must throw a coin in the fountain. - My name`s Barnaba, and yours? - Cristina. - That`s a queen`s name. Are you a queen? Not yet. I want to see if what you said is true. - Can you change a copax? - What is it? A copax. - That`s gold! How much is it worthy? - 800.000 liras. Can you change it? I don`t have coins. - I`ll throw it, so I come back! - A golden coin! - A little coin would have been enough. - That means I`ll come back often. - After our honeymoon. - No kidding. Shall we go? Do you know what? I do never joke. As soon as I saw you, I decided that we would get married. - What else do you want to see? - Many things, but I have no time. - There`s a lot of traffic here. - I know a shortcut. The pics will be out of focus. Hold on! Now we drive through via dei Coronari, the antiquarian`s street. CLACSON - A stronzo! (n.d.r.you ass-hole) - What does it mean "astronzo"? It`s a compliment. If you like somebody you call him "astronzo". This is the Foro Romano. - Today is thursday, the Foro is closed. - Are you sure it`s thursday? - Yes. Look at the calendar. You`re right! It`s not thursday. If you meet a policeman "Water your mouth". (ndr mum`s word) If we see a policeman we must drink? - Drink? - He said "water your mouth". That`s a saying. Can you talk if you have water in your mouth? - Too bad! Are there no "demostene"?. - Who? - A guide. - Un cicero! I will be your cicero. I know Rome`s history. What is this? - Can you see it? - What is it? It`s a plow. Can`t you hear the oxen? MOO Etruscan oxen. Romolo is plowing. But his brother Remo told him... ..."Why don`t we call this town Amor?" "No", Romolo said, as he always contradicted him... ..."We`ll call it Roma and nobody can enter here." But Remo, being distracted, put his foot in a groove. Then Romolo attacked him and they had a terrible fight. Don`t do this, Remo! What a pain! Whose arm is that? When I fight with myself, I am terrible. Then Romolo said: "We don`t have anymore girls". He took the chariot and left. WHINNY WHIP Barnaba? I can`t see you anymore. Barnaba, where are you? - Here I am! - What are you doing? The rape of the Sabine women.The Romans and the Sabine fell in love at first sight. But I am not a sabine. And I am not a roman. Keep on telling the story. What happened then? There were the seven kings of Rome, who were seven like the hills. They said: "Why fighting?" And they got one hill each. So the Romans marched at roman pace... ...they arrived in France at french pace... ...and in Spain at spanish pace. But they met some brawny fellows... ...with such a beard. No, such. No, such. And said: "What a bear!" They were dressed in a barbarian way. The barbarians, with the beard. The head of barbarians said: "Ehi, bear..." "...what are the Romans doing?" "They lay down and eat grapes with one hand." "And with the other one?" "They touch the women slaves." "Don`t laugh! And with the other one?" "They play zither." "And with the other one?" "They drink wine." "All their hands are occupied?" "All of them." "Let`s go." So they crossed the Alps and they destroyed the Roman Empire. - See the empires? Just kick them - Wow! Let`s go. HONKING - Tank it up? - Yes, 2.000. - 2.000 litres? - 2.000 liras. The bigger their cars the more churlish they are. - Where do you come from? - From a land in central Europe. - You can`t find it even on the globe. - Is it France? - Can`t you find France ? - I have a very small globe. Mister, I clean your windows. Absurd! Unbelievable! What do you mean "disappeared"? - Did you look well? - Sure. - What`s his name... - Corman. - Corman! - Here I am, Sir. We`ve been looking everywhere. - Your daughter is crazy. - Please, Gustave, do something. You`re right. Corman, call the Ministry of Internal Affairs. No, just a moment! And the media, Sir? - What`s wrong with the media? - What about our relationship with the banks? What our friends in St. Tulipe will think? - What are we going to do? - I have an idea. Corman, go away. Better to act alone, my men will do something. - You are beautiful. - Thanks. Are you changing clothes? - What? - I forgot to comb my hair. - But you have a hat! - My hair are a mess under the hat. - Ready? - Just one moment. (singing) Take it easy, you can even take your all life. Ready? Yes. And now what? Outside is hot, so I came back here. I understand. - What did you understand? - That you want to stay with me. - You`re wrong. - Then go out! - I don`t want to! I mean, I will. She`s not here, let`s look somewhere else. A friend of mine met a girl. As soon as he saw her he got a stroke. Because she was not that nice, she was a monster. But you are beautiful. - Have you ever been in love? - Not really. - When I was a girl I had a terrible "crash". - What? When you get suddenly in love. - A crush. - Have you ever been in love? - Never so seriously, until today. - Are you in love? I am happy for you. - Who`s she? - Are you kidding? - I am in love with you. - Yes, I knew. But love declarations embarrass me a lot. I received the last one from one of the Krupp.. ...the cannons` producers. - Do you love me or not? - If not, I`ll kill myself. - I don`t believe you. - Then say something. - Shall I ? - You say and you`ll see. - No. - No? But... Now I must kill myself. I am going to kill myself. Barnaba? Barnaba! Barnaba? Barnaba! Barnaba! Barnaba! - Barnaba! - Pss... - Barnaba! You are alive. - And what if I kiss you in public? - I would slap you. - But, if we`d get married... - You and I? We would be a great couple. You are beautiful and I am much better than you are. - There are some problems. - I have no problems. I see, the age difference. In 20 years you`ll be 40, but it doesn`t matter. PEDLAR SHOUTING Ehi, come here. ARAB SPEAKING - Do you like it? - Why? - For the bedroom. - A white carpet would fit it. - Are you crazy? You`re right, a dark carpet is better. ARAB SPEAKING IMITATION He can`t understand. ARAB SPEAKING - He says he doesn`t have dark carpets. - No dark carpets? Go away! Shame of you? ARAB INSULTING - You ass-hole! - Everybody likes you, don`t they? Yes. - Give me the cap. - Why? I am going to dive. Wow!

Barnaba! - Did you talked to each other? - No. - Confess it, you gave her money. - No. How could she know those things? - She`s my aunt! - Cheater! Swindler! Buffoon! - You are good! - I`ll tell you a secret. - I am a police lieutenenat. - Lieuttenant? - Yes. - Strange, I though you were a General. - Miss, you won a doll! I don`t like it. I want the monkey. - Give her the monkey. - That`s pretty, it looks like you. - Really? - He`s more hairy. We never give the monkey to anybody. If it`s a prize, you should give it. Then I`ll give it for 5 jackpots with one shot! Give me the rifle. Wow! I`ve never seen something like that. You are very good! Are you a policeman too? I`ll tell you a secret. I have a big butt. I don`t think so, you are normal. You are thin. That`s a saying, it means that I am lucky. - I have a dinner at Campidoglio! - Is it a restaurant? I will take you to a luxurious pizza place. - Is it on the Michelin? - On the Tiber. - God, I must really go! - At what time? - At nine. - It`s nine. - Nine? - Yes. (together) God! This is Cristina, can I talk to my father? - It`s princess Cristina. - Finally! - Cristina! - Dad, how are you? Where are you? Who`s there? - A friend. - Which friend? Come back!

Everybody`s waiting for you, the mayor, the cardina... - Oietti. - The governor of the Central Bank. - The minister of Turism. - Please, come back soon. - It`s an order. - What are you doing? - Let me talk. Don`t be angry, your daughter is with me. Who are you? Cecchini Barnaba, bus driver. I`ll take her to dinner and then I`ll send her home. To dinner? I can pay, don`t worry. Goodbye. - How did he sound like? - He was kind. Your daughter is going to dinner with a bus driver. When we met, you took me to a eastern restaurant! I was goint to be a prince. Send your men, check the best restaurants! One moment! Can I suggest something? - Tell me. - Usually a bus driver... brings a girl to a pizza place. - Check all the pizza places. - Corman! - Do you like this place? - It`s nice. It`s better than Campidoglio. I live there. We`re renting a flat. - When we will be married... - When? Ah! You want to know when we will be married. Is it fine this month on the 27th? I`ll get my salary, 15 vacation days, honeymoon. Venice, Trieste, Monza. - Well? - What shall we order? Mario cooks some great filled up calzoni. Really? - Hi, Barnaba. - Hi, Mario. What a beautiful girl! Every night a new one! - What do you want to eat? - I would like your filled up ``pants``. - The calzoni. - We have only suppli`. - Nothing else? - No. Then I choose the suppli`. What are you having? - Suppl. - Do you have suppl? - Yes. - Then bring them! - You will like them. - What do they taste like? - Suppl. I would like to buy that rented flat. Down a wall and we have four rooms. - Four? - Isn`t it fine? - How many rooms do you have? - Well... Forty-two. - What`s the name of the hotel? - What? - The hotel makes profit. We get the money from the casino. Do you know what is it? Sure, that thing with prostitutes! I don`t need money from your parents, even if they are so rich. We could get married only if... - If? - If it would snow in august. It will. - This wine is good. - Be careful. It`s good, but tricky. They call them "phone suppl" because they have the wire. - Hello? Is it Cristina? - Yes. Today was a wonderful day. Let`s talk about tomorrow. I am off at 4, we meet at 5, I talk to dad... ...and ask to marry you. Is it ok? Hello? Hello? Broken connection. Why are you laughing? - You have two noses and four eyes! - No more wine. - They are in a pizza place. - What do they do? - They eat suppl. You wait for the best moment to block the man... ...and take back the princess. - Ok, Corman. (tipsy voice) I will tell you a secret. Don`t get scared. I am Cristina from St. Tulipe. - I am a princess. - Don`t exaggerate. - Mario, the bill! - Don`t you believe me? - I am a princess. - And I am the duke of Windsor. - That`s impossible, I know him. He`s my godfather. - The bill. - I don`t want to leave. It`s early. - We have to go. - Let`s dance. - Better to go. Can`t we dance? I will dance alone. Somebody wants to dance with me? - I will. - How nice. - Tango! MUSIC - You can`t dance with this lady. - Why not? - I say not. - Or? I can`t say, you would get scared. I`ll show you what I can do. What a beast! Oh! What are you doing? Put me down! Put me down! Wow! - I am tired, I am sleepy. Where are we going? - At home. - Where do you live? - Who? - Me. - I don`t know. - I can`t remember. - Come on, no kidding. I feel sick. Take me to sleep. Let me go! I can walk. The suppl and the wine were good. The wine was better. - Nobody around. - It`s the good moment. Let`s go! It will take longer,but nobody will see us. There it is. Damn! We can`t search around all over the houses. Soon or later they will go out, just wait. - Goodnight, dear. - Barnaba. - Yes? - I just wanted to say that I had a wonderful day. You are so nice, so good. You are a real "astronzo". Thanks. Time to sleep. BARNABA SNORES - Cristina! Where are you going? - At home. - I will take you there. - No, impossible - Why? I bet it`s impossible! You locked me inside! Cristina, open the door! Open! Open! SINGING knocking Nobody`s there. Who`s knocking? There`s nobody here. Not even here. I am here! - Barnaba! What are you doing in the drawer? - What else should I do? I am sleeping. Usually I sleep in the bed. Cristina! Where are you going? Cristina! Well, this is Cristina. But she has soft hair, like a spring breeze... ...and shining eyes, like the sun at dawn. Got it? I was forgetting a very important detail. I am madly in love with her. The blood. You must look for her and bring her here as soon as you find her. Got it? Come on, guys! Look everywhere. - Some tea, sir? - Yes, please. Well, can you tell us what did you do yesterday night? You`ve been with him all night. What happened? Cristina, I order you to talk to me. Talk! Ok, now I should go. I`ve a meeting at the Central Bank. But we still need to talk. We still do! Cristina, my dear, you can tell me. Me too, in Venice, I spent a night with a gondoliere. What a paddle! And the way he moved it! There was nothing between us. It`s an old story. Italian men are not the same men as in the past! - Today Barnaba is in a different mood. - That`s true. - Maybe because he can`t find his girlfriend. - That`s true. - What`s up? - How long have you been here? - Since sunrise. So what? Did you see a woman with her eyes as blue... ...as the clouds in the sky at march? "As clouds in the sky at march." - Of whom I am madly in love. - "Of whom I am madly in love." - Madly with final "y". - With final "y". - Is it correct to stop like this? - No. - Go away then! - Have you seen her? - Go away! - Have you seen her? - The one with blue march eyes? - Yes. - No, I haven`t! Why didn`t you tell me before! - What`s up? - If you see her, just tell me. - Ok. - You know where I am going? - Yes, I know. - Where am I going? - To fuck off! - Good. - We found her. - I found her. She`s got also a camera. - Hi! - It`s me! - It`s me! That`s not her. (Tv) At Porto Ercole there was the yearly windsurf competition. The participants came from all over the world... Do you want some? I forgot you eat only peanuts. Barnaba, do you want a soup? You can`t live without eating. With so many women, he just fell in love with a heartless one! (Tv) This is princess Cristina from St. Tulipe... ...visiting Rome. She`s wearing the uniform of tenent of Royal Guards. Iris! I found her! That`s her, the princess! - Iris! lris! - What`s up?

I take care. - No, I take care. I want to see his face. Bring him here. Can I suggest something? Sometimes it`s better to give money. Hi, dad. Do you like my? It`s a Finkleman. How much does it cost? - Three millions. - Three millions? We should reduce our costs. This is mine! How come is here now?

Maybe we need a referendum. - Good idea. What are you talking about! You are not going to meet heranymore. Now you are clear. Before you didn`t say that. - That`s the way it was, I think. - Yes. I don`t have a watch, I take back the flower... - But you`ll see. Remember. - I`ll remember. - Shall I go or shall you go? - You go. - Thanks.

We should have gone dancing. Why didn`t you come? If I am not there, how can I give you an answer? TELEPHONE RINGING - I`ve just said I am not there. - Not even for me? Cristina! I am there for you. - Thanks for the night song. - Just to be nice. Yesterday I met your father. I asked him to marry you. He didn`t quite agree, but there are no big problems. - Is it fine tomorrow morning at 9? - To get married? I booked for the 27th. Tomorrow morning we chose the favors. Even the favors! First of all I would like to have breakfast with you.. ...in a dairy where they bake great croissants. - Tomorrow morning I`m having breakfast with Pertini. - He can come too. - That`s impossible. - Why? BUZZ Damn! - What`s up? - A mosquito. Wait a moment. Tomorrow morning you can`t. - Is it ok tomorrow afternoon at 16 at nr 29 end point? - I can`t. - I am very busy. - Can`t you find a minute? - Let`s have lunch at Mario`s. - I can`t. - I have a big "receipt" at the embassy. - What? When you invite many people. - A reception! - Yes. - Then I will be there. To be honest is an invitation lunch with many famous people. Then you can invite me. Do you feel seating among many other important people? I understand. I am not good enough, am I? You`re so haughty, snob and spoiled. After we`re married, you`ll change behaviour. Stupid. Presumptuous. - Moron. - Moron to who? - You! - Then I heard well. Very well. Do you want an invitation? I`ll send it. Now. (english speaking) (french speaking) ATAC. - War cross. - First Communion. - My invitation. - Thanks. Hi, Cristina. Who`s this beautiful woman? She looks like you. - She`s my mother. - I thought she was your sister. Very kind of you. And so nice! Are you a gondoliere? - No, bus driver. - Too bad!. Sir, I take care. Hi, Gustavo! How are you? Fine. - Did you invite him? - Surely not. - Did you invite him? - Did you invite him? - Yes, I invited him. - She invited him. Cristina! No! The wine drives her crazy. Do you remember? - Here you are. - Thanks. It`s delicious. Not so much but... Hey guys, they invited a bus driver! - A bus driver at the embassy? - Yes, I know him. - His name is Barnaba. - I know him too! - Everybody knows him. - Stop it! You serve the turkey. Come on! Alt. Go. Reagan monetary policy is wrong. If you increase interest taxes you provoke an irriversible spiral. The only solution against inflation is to stop credits. - What do you think about it? - Me? - Yes, you. Following my experience I can say that too many stops... ...provoke circulation blocks. It is dangerous to increase monetary circulation. - The deposits could suffer out of it. - What would you do? I would leave into the deposits only emergency stocks... ...in order to fulfill the needs of population at top moments. In this way you would follow Smith`s theories. - Do you belong to Smith`s line? - No, to line 29. It`s connected to the crisis of `29 caused by credits block. Correct. Barnaba is giving a lesson of economy. Wow! I had a tree behind me and a wild boar 10 steps ahead. I closed my eyes, I shot and I centred his face. Lady, you have a big butt! Your weapons are a threaten to the peace. The russians keep on increasing weapong. The americans should stop first. If you increase your basis in Europe we`ll give weapons to the Eastern Countries. And we will be forced to double military funding. - Can I say something? - Are you expert of foreign policy? No, but your ideas affect me also if I shouldn`t know some things. Sometimes I understand better than who knows more than I do. For example. There are two buses. One... I take your bus. There`s a narrow road. The one on the right says: "I won`t stop". The one on the left won`t stop either. The on on the right accelerates to get him scared. The one on the left understands and goes on fourth gear. So... Consequence: 40 people dead ... You can count them. And 80 wounded, if not worse. There`s a dead person on your leg. The passengers are the ones that always pay the consequences... ...and the passengers are the population. What a silence! The dead were not real! These are just french fries. Be happy! - What is doing a 30 kilos bird on a tree? - What? Who knows what is doing a 30 kilos bird on a tree? - What does he do? - If he weighs 30 kilos, he`s a capitalist. - No. - Sir, do you know? - Is he praying? - No. Is he sleeping? - Why should he sleep? - If he weighs 30 kilos... ...it means that he ate a lot and he feels sleepy. - No. What is he doing? - Does he have digesting problems? - No. - He breaks the branch. - No. - He plays the solitary bird. - No. Who knows it? - He`s on diet. - No. Who knows it? - I know. - If you`re wrong, you`re fired. - I take the risk. - What does he do? - He cleans his feathers. Too bad! A broken carreer. Shall we forgive him? Nobody knows? Cristina... ...do you know? - No, you tell me. A 30 kilos bird on a tree does... ...TWEEEEEEEEEEEEET! why are you laughing? What does a 30 kilos bird do on a treeo? He makes a 30 kilos egg so that I can make an omelette for 60 people. Take the cake in the other room. Go! Alt! Go. - Shall I serve dessert, Sir? - Yes. - One moment! I brought a cake. I`ll pick it up in the car. He`s funny, isn`t he? He`s prepared and smart. Yes, very funny. What`s his specialization? Transportation. - He`s a nice guy. - A bit intrusive... - There lies his charm. - Here I am! There`s enough for everybody. There`s also a royal pastry for you, Sir. Please! This is for the queen. A saint-honor for the cardinal. - Can I have one? - Sure, which one? - The cannolo. - Here it is. - A diplomatic for you. - Congratulations! - Which cake do you want? - I don`t eat cakes. - And your sons? - I don`t have sons. - Why? - I never thought about that. Fantastic! This is a real nice lunch! Barnaba gave me a cake. - Did you accept it? - Sure, and so did the king! CLINKING What`s happening now? Attention, please! Silence! Silence! I take advantage of this occasion to give you some good news. - I mean, you can say it, dad! - What are you talking about? - You say it. - No. Then I`ll say it.

I kiss you if... - No ifs.... If? - If you let me go. Ok. What are you doing? The door is open. Didn`t you want to leave? Why? You love me. - Yes. - How much? - Very much. - I thought more. I loved you since the first moment I met you. - Why didn`t you say that before? - We can never get married. - Only if it would snow in august. - Right. Let`s check the weather. It`s snowing! It`s august... - One moment... - Don`t open. - Why? You could get a cold. Princess, congratulations! You`re a cheater, a clown! - Now, do you want to refuse? - No, I will marry you. - If... - No ifs. What? - We get married on the mountains, afar from the crowd. - Why? My father must not know, he wants me to marry Krupp. - The one of the rolls? - The cannons! Ok, dear. When are we going to tell dad? After the wedding. I would rather do that after the third child. - I must tell you a secret. - Which one? We are surrounded.
