It's ready. -Thanks. -It's ready now, -Good. -Did you go out with your husband? -No, he didn't want to come. -So I went to the movies. -On your own? Yes. I saw Bridget Jones. It was excellent! No-life, hurry up! Keep it down. We have neighbors. Robbers' hideout -Can you do a prisoner transport? -Right away? That sleeping bag is soaking wet. You'll get us all arrested. Yeah... -Want some? -No, thanks. -For William -Sure. He should have been here. Let's go. Drivers first. Come on. On. Yes? It will be alright. Are you okay? I get so carsick in the back. It's alright. -Do you get carsick? -Not carsick. I'm just sick. Police station Quiet? Some kids stole a moped. -Thought you straightened them out -I did. Just wait and see. It needs to be done fast, -Preferably right away. -Problems? The surveillance from NOKAS went black again. Didn't they promise to fix that before Easter? Sure, but they are moving, I guess they decided to wait, -Saves them money. -Why is this so important today? We received a report that NOKAS is a possible target for a robbery. Just what we need this week. We're low on staff. Parole room -What's up? -He's reading, so here we are. Okay, let's start. "Several police sources confirm that a large robbery - -is planned in Southern Norway. Target: A hub for cash transfer. Given this information, NOKAS is a likely target in Stavanger." -And the conclusion? -Don't know, I just got the report. And it's just us here. -The dog patrol? -On holiday. -Sitting here is not going to help, -No. Stop by the desk sergeant. -Weapons? -Yes. You'll be Charlie 3-0. Drive past NOKAS at least once every hour. Great. Have you heard the sound log from the post centre robbery? Heavy stuff. They shoot at the police with AK-47 and AG-3 rifles. And, they have hostages and body armor. And now they're here in town. All we get are super soakers. Blame the police commissioner. If you don't have anything for us we'll drive past NOKAS. Good. -Got anything for me? -Stavanger city jail... -Speed charger. -Thanks. Testing. Check. Let's go out and do some proper police work. If I'd been told before, I could have kept people back. It's the holidays. No one wants to disappoint their kids. It's always the same. No one tells us anything before it's too late. -But what can I do about it? -We need to change our routines. We should do that. First meeting point Come here, guys. Come on! -Get a move on! -We enter the back yard... Break the window like a cracker, Piece of cake. The vault was just opened. If not, we force the hostages. Everything goes into the bags. Get the large notes. 500, 1000. It's in and out, quickly. No bullshit! Eight minutes, max. The men outside... Show your authority. You look like a bunch of bad guys. If the police come, pat your gun. We're in charge, we're stronger. -What if they start shooting? -Nobody will shoot at us. -It's over before it starts. -We're in charge. The cars will go their separate ways for the next three hours. Low profile. The drivers know the meeting point? Yes. Of course. Scandinavia's biggest robbery The biggest, guys! Let's go! It was my first night, a Friday. Long queue, lots of people. A Paki comes along in an expensive suit, with a beautiful woman. Starts nagging about wanting in, saying he was the owner. I said it's full, as I'd been told. But he just went on and on. I grab him and push him, hard, so he falls down the stairs. Okay... -Of course, he really was the boss. -The Paki was the owner? Sure. I'd never met him before. Stupid to refuse blacks when you're a Paki yourself. So I was fired without notice This was where we parked. -I don't get this. -What? -Why bring evidence to the crime? -We're going to burn it. A lot of things catch Ere. Doesn't have to be my DNA. -Hey! -What's up? -Hurry up, someone is coming! -Alright, alright. Just finish, hurry up! Close the rear door, hurry! Just close the rear door and follow me. Hurry, now! -You should read that one. -But it won't open! Look... There. -A robbery? -The police think it's possible. -Typical of them to send an email. -Should we go get the bags? -Good morning. -Are you going back down? -No, but the elevator is. -So you're here today? -So many bags today. -People shop like crazy for Easter. I can't work overtime, -How many did you get? -64. Great, that adds up. Sign here. My husband is picking me up, we're going straight to the cabin. Sounds lovely! There's a loophole that no one thought of, I'm sure. -The window falls at the first blow. -Okay, sure, but... -Why the word "cracker"? -Silent! The building is from the sixties. Not even the US President - -had a bullet-proof car back then. There are no other entrances. Is it better secured than the President? Outside shipyard Two mopeds, they say. Alpha 1-4, Charlie 2-0. Repeat the last message. They say that two mopeds are involved. Copy that. ...just to go home alone, right, So why the hell bother? Are we going to park here? -There's a patrol car nearby. -How exciting. They're looking for a moped downtown. Now they turned on the sirens. Let's say you can take 600 kilos, More than that is impossible. -How much money is that? -No more than 200 million. You see films where they run off with several hundred millions. What currency? 100 Euro bills wouldn't let you take that much. These films don't make sense. Heat and all those films. It's just bullshit. It's heavy. You'd need forklifts and lorries, We're sitting here like a bunch of clowns. Can't we just go? -Last chance to back down. -That's the last thing Id do now. Let's get paid, gentlemen! -Isn't this it? -I think it's the next. -It was that exit. -You're right. -Turn around. -I'll drive down to the roundabout. -Fuck! Turn around! -I can't turn here. Calm down. Turn. Right here, outside the police station, with them in front of us? -They don't know we're here -How do you know? Bloody hell... I told you so. -The station should be sealed off, -We can't seal it before we start. They'll need to to back to get their guns anyway. One minute earlier This is such a slow gate. This is Charlie 3-0. We're off now. Our number is 245. I met the section manager for the juvenile unit last week. I had to admit to playing that practical joke on him. He'd left his of rice open, the PC on, You just don't do that! So I sent emails to all the section managers, - -summoning them to a meeting the next day. Imagine his face when they call him, ask him to attend his own meeting. Heck, he was mad! Good joke, though. Charlie 3-0, Alpha 1-4. Responding. A break-in is reported in a kindergarten west of the city. Typical. -Charlie 3-0, we're on our way, -Received. Who breaks in to a kindergarten? -That guy needs some guidance. -A fine. -No, guidance. -Okay, then he's yours. No problem. -Blue lights? -Yes. See, he stopped. Last meeting point Move a bit to the right, Clouded, 6-7 degrees centigrade. It will be a wet day in Stavanger with more rain. Here they are! It's stuck! I'll get it. Fix that shit. -A new model. Use both hands. -Just fix it. Use both hands. Good luck, then. -Okay, it's ready. -Come on, guys. You look healthy. We can do this! Come on, more cans! Let's finish up here. -Don't pee on my sleeping bag! -Look at him, he's not right. -Give me another can. -Come on. Soak it with fuel, light it and throw it inside. Fumes ignite, so stand back, or you'll burn your face. Are you alright? His cancer is so rare they named it after him. He is sick. Is he driving? Come on, guys! Let's go for gold! Solberg, come on! You drive. D rive 1 -Remember your phone. -Two minutes. Come on. We're the last. You forgot your helmet. Wake up! One minute left, come on! -Did you forget your pills? -I'm okay. -If you're not feeling... -I'm alright, I said. Forget those bloody pills. -Whats the matter with your mask? -Is something wrong with it? Everyone can see your face. Do you want to get caught? He hasn't sewn it together. Nothing to do about that now. We won't get caught. Relax. Doesn't matter to me anyway. The church square outside NOKAS If you need to puke, do it in the car. Come on, let's do this! Come on, guys! Bring the battering ram. The ladder, come on! Here, hit it! -Step aside! -Hit it! Outside the police station Fuck! Fucking hell... -The grenades! Throw them now! -Relax!
