Ladies and gentlemen, any of you can shoot the spots from playing cards, given a steady hand, keen eyes, iron nerves... and 12 years of practice. My gratitude for your assistance. And to show my appreciation, I'd like to present you with these beautiful earrings. I was told that they once belonged to the grand padishah of Hindustan. Oh, thank you, Mr. Carter. Thank you. You're very welcome; thank you. Now, would another intrepid soul step forward to assist in a demonstration which has astounded the crowned heads of 11 countries? Anyone will do. No harm can possibly come to you. Aha, I see I have a candidate. That's the spirit, young fellow. Up the steps right onto the stage. Bring your feet with you. Stand there. Take this deck of cards. While my back is turned, choose one... any card will do. Do you have it? Yes, sir. Show it to the audience. What do you think? Sure enough resembles him. Exceptin' the time I seen him, he had whiskers. Well, the best thing is to catch him outside. Now put it back in the deck. Now watch closely. In my left hand I have the deck of cards, in my right, the personal throwing weapon of the late Colonel James Bowie. With its help, I shall endeavor to discover the card in question. Well, I'll be! The ace of hearts. Here he comes. Colonel Desmond? Colonel Desmond? You gentlemen speaking to me? We were. Afraid there must be some mistake. The name is Johnny Carter. Ah, no it ain't. I couldn't forget you, Colonel. Our outfit fought right alongside of you at Forest Ridge. Just a minute, Scamper. Maybe introductions are in order, Mr., uh, Carter. This is Mr. Newton, Sergeant Joad, and I'm Jeb Bassett. All formerly of the Ninth Virginia. How do you do? You were in the Confederate Army, Mister... Carter? Why, yes. Yes, I was. Good. We want to make you a proposition. We need a man like you where we live... Coppertown... to keep us from losing our claims. I know nothing about mining. The mines are all right. There's something else. We're being frozen out because we're Southerners. Coppertown's smelter won't buy our ore. We've had accidents in the mine. Three men killed already. When one of us tries to take ore to Mesa City, something always happens to him or his wagon. What about the law? Get away from me, you overgrown jackrabbit. The law's against us, too, won't raise a finger to help. That's why we need a man like you, Colonel... er, Mr. Carter... as a leader and... Law breaker? Let's say someone who can face up to the law if it isn't doing right. What in tarnation do you want? Chewing tobacco, Sergeant. Chewing tobacco? Why-why, I never heard of anything like... What brand? Here you are. Well, gentlemen, it's true I was in the war, but as a corporal. But now I'm a peaceful man, following a peaceful occupation. I'm sorry, but I must refuse your invitation. Good night. Colonel? We were told to give you a special message from the man who brought us out here... Mr. Theodosius Roberts, formerly of Beardsville, Virginia. Name's unfamiliar. We got the wrong man, Jeb. I guess you're right. Nothing on earth could keep Colonel Desmond out of the fracas we got. Let's mosey. Keep away from me, will ya? Hi, Travis. Why aren't you fellows working? Ain't you heard? Show people coming to town. Pretty gals! Figurin' on greetin' them, make them feel at home. I'll bet they'll feel at home with you. It's all right, Ma. You done nothing against the law. Some people are kind of fussy about ladies smoking. Where you been all day? Riding. You look it. Where's Lisa? In the saloon, playing cutthroat with the sheriff. Again? You'd think he'd know better by now. Hey... Um, want to take a peek? Travis? I want to ask you something. Go ahead, Cora. How about treating a girl? - On the 31st of February. ...31st of February. She's in there. Thanks. Howdy, Miss Cora. Five. I'm compelled to raise you ten, Lisa. I'll call you. Hello, beautiful. Pick it up. Three. Fine way to treat me. Next time ask permission. I will. Next time. How many? Two to the dealer. Check. Have a nice ride? Three went and three came back. Oh, Sheriff? Well, hello, Mr. Balfour. I hope I'm not interrupting. Not at all. What can I do for you? Today is payday at the smelter and I'd like your protection. Now, Mr. Balfour, there ain't gonna be any trouble. The Southerners have been acting strange the last few days. Secretive and arrogant. They're planning something, maybe robbery. Robbery? You better go hold his hand, Sheriff. Who, me? I'm no man for robberies, I don't even carry a gun... can't stand the noise! You go, Travis, and take Bat here with you. You're my deputies, ain't you? All right. But I'll tell you this, Balfour, the Rebs is done for. I disagree. They're like wolves... vicious, desperate. They're just a defeated people, Mr. Balfour. And rightfully so! Slavers, secessionists, lawbreakers and murderers! They're like anyone else... human beings. I never could understand why you won't deal with them. Perhaps you would, ma'am, if you lost a son at Gettysburg! Seems we had the wrong man, Mr. Roberts. Some fly-by-night vaudeville actor. Name of Johnny Carter. That's strange... He must look mighty like Colonel Desmond because Scamper was fooled. Still am, 'ceptin' it couldn't be, not after the way he acted. We put it straight to him; mentioned your name, like you said, and told him that... Who could that be, Caroline? I'll go see, Gramp. Oh, it's you. I'm afraid so, ma'am. You see, I've got orders to find out... Same old orders, Lieutenant, or some nice, fresh, new ones? Well, it's just that I have to make inquiries as to whether you've had any news of... Oh, no, not again? Sorry, ma'am. My dear Lieutenant, I may not look it, but I'm quite grown up. I can count up to ten and I can even remember as far back as a week ago. I feel awful about this, ma'am, but... Oddly enough, I can even remember the questions you asked me. Now, since you've obviously forgotten my answers, I'm going to repeat them to you again very slowly and maybe it will save you another visit. Now, about my brother-in-law, Colonel Desmond. One. I haven't heard from him. In fact, I've never heard from him. Two. I've never seen him in my whole life and I wouldn't know him if I did see him, because he was in one of your prisons when Tom and I were married, and he was still there when Tom was killed. Three. And if I had him right here in my pocket, I certainly wouldn't tell you! Now... do you think you can remember all that? Uh, yes, Mrs. Desmond. Wonderful. And isn't it enough that he's a defeated soldier without your persecuting him? Oh, in this case, ma'am, it isn't exactly persecution. Well, what is it? Well, you see, when Colonel Desmond was a prisoner of war, he escaped with the contents of the Commandant's safe... $20,000. Good for him. Well, now, why didn't you tell me that before? That's wonderful! I'm afraid the United States government feels different. It'd like both him and the money locked up again. Oh... Well, how long a term would he receive? They're saying ten years. I know how you feel, ma'am. If you happen not to be telling all you know, I... wouldn't blame you. I think you better go. What I'm trying to say is I'd much rather be chasing Indians, but since I have orders, it's not... Did you hear what my granddaughter said, Lieutenant? Yes, sir. And in the future, please remember you are not welcome here. Is that the young fellow who was here before? Yes. But I don't think he'll come back again. Couldn't be he's the reason Colonel Desmond wouldn't come, wouldn't admit who he was? Might be. No, Gramp, it couldn't be. If he were Tom's brother, he'd have come regardless. I reckon you're right. I reckon I don't have to say that I'm disappointed. Seems every hope we've cherished for a year has been a mirage. Fool's gold. Joseph Senn. Yes, sir, Joseph Senn! Ah, mister, I do like payday. I guess that's right. Yes, sir, just is. Rainbow Saloon, here I come! Save me a drink, Joe! William Barton. That's me, and is this a happy moment. William Barton. Nothing wrong with that. Let me through here! What do you want? I want a word with you. I'm busy! You weren't too busy this morning while you were smelting my copper. What do you mean? Just what I'm saying. While my boys was off hunting and I was away, some thieving scoundrel carried my ore up here and you smelted it for him. I want to know who. I don't know anything about your ore or any other Rebel's! You're lying! Either tell me who stole it or pay for it... I don't much care which. Take it easy, Bassett. You keep out of this. For once we're going to get a square deal here! Outside. Get back, all of you. Keep moving! I'm going, but I ain't finished. Watch that door. So you're telling me to keep out of this, huh, Bassett? I certainly am. Supposing I don't? We'll get someone around here who'll see there's right. Go ahead, Ethan. Don't mark up his face. We want him pretty for his folks. Get him up and out of there. Travis! You needn't have been so brutal. Why, Mr. Balfour, you told me yourself they're as dangerous as wolves. Whoopee! Girls! What is it? Entertainers... girls! Ah, no, you don't! Hooray! Mr. Bixby. That's me. Ma Tarbet's my name. Welcome to Coppertown. I own this place. Get your troupe in and I'll show them where they're going to roost. Get back, boys, get back. The show goes on tonight. Hello. Hello. Hello. I'm the professor. I play the piano. I'm going to play for you tonight. Hey, hey! I'll help him, sonny. Watch it, Professor. Whoopee! I'm going to put my brand on this one! Whoa! No, put me down! That a boy, Lew! Hold it, boys, hold it! Hold it! Lew Partridge, put that girl down. I said put that girl down. Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Lisa. I... I never meant no harm. That's better. Good for you, Lisa. By golly, he did come. Who'd you say came? Oh, nobody. Nobody at all. I... I was just talking to myself, that's all. He must've come here to help us. Oh, thunderation, it's you again. Or maybe it's your cousin. Oh, well, here, here. I thought we had troubles before but it's nothing to what's coming. The boys will probably be riding horses up and down the halls all night. Why don't you put two in a room? Two in a room? I'm putting five in a room. Come on, gals, I'll show you the way. That leaves us two men. Yes, you and Signor Martelli. Johnny Carter, ma'am. I thought you had an Italian tenor. Well, unfortunately, he disappeared. It's the strangest thing I ever saw. With us one minute and gone the next. Yes, luckily for you, I had a few free days between engagements. You do sing Italian, of course. Only in the bath, ma'am. What is this? Mr. Carter is a trick-shot artist. Trick-shot artist?! Why, the town is full of them. Yes, it is. And so is the cemetery. I hear you've got quite an extensive one in Coppertown. Well, I guess he'll have to do. You'll share the same room. Thank you, Miss Roselle. You know, ma'am, I never thought the day would come when I'd regret not being an Italian tenor. Well, I'm saying we should pull up stakes. And I'm saying you're a quitter. Ain't we got the right on our side? That we have. Yes, and Moss Balfour has got the might. If we stick together like we done through the war, ain't nobody gonna whip us. As soon as my boys get back, I'm aiming to square accounts with Travis and that other deputy. Jeb Bassett, you lay back like the doctor said. Sorry, Mrs. Bassett. We'll move along, Jeb, and let you get a little rest. Now, Martha, I'm fine. We just heard about it, Dad. You hurt bad? I'll be up and around in a couple of hours. Then we can decide what to do. Jeb, you ain't gonna pull them into this. What's a man have sons for if not to help him? He's right, Ma. I suffered enough from the war, losing Carey and Tom, worrying and praying for you and the other boys. I'm wore out with suffering. Why can't we leave like the others, go someplace where it's safe? A man's got to do what he thinks best, Mother. Come in. Mr. Roberts. Yes, come in. Come right in, please. I was told you wanted to see me. My name is... Why, of course. I know who you are. Can't escape a reputation like yours, you know. Well, thank you, sir. It is kind of a showy act, but people seem to like it. Well, sit down, Colonel, sit down. No colonel. Just plain Johnny Carter. Oh, well, sit down anyway. Thank you. And, uh, Mr. Carter, with a reward out for Colonel Desmond's arrest and every Yankee soldier in the country out to collect, I can readily understand the colonel's reluctance to admit to his identity. Haven't seen one of these for years. A useful gun in its day, but like its owner, no longer much good in a fight. Tell me about Lisa Roselle. Oh, you know it's very odd that you should be so curious about Lisa Roselle. She's a beautiful woman. Oh, come, come, sir. I'll wager at my age you'd be equally curious. I say it's odd because this Lisa Roselle is within the framework of all the wickedness that threatens us. There's a scoundrel named Henderson who proposes to run us out of the country and take over our mines. Operating for him here is this Lisa Roselle and her crew of bullyboys... Deputy Sheriff Travis and his men. What do you know about her? Very little, except that she's a New Orleans adventuress, clever and unscrupulous. Quite a woman. And quite an idea. Yeah, that's part of our trouble. Travis and the others we can handle, maybe, but how does one fight a woman? Women are difficult, sir, but not invulnerable. Somewhere along the line there's always a weak spot in their fortifications and to find it requires vast experience. But having found it, they'll fold up like army tents. You certainly seem to know your business. And I might add that their final capitulation is always fraught with the most charming possibilities. But one question, sir. Why am I being haunted by the ghost of this... this Colonel Desmond? It's the simple arithmetic of violence and oppression, Mr. Carter. My men are being killed in the mines, shot to death taking ore to Mesa City... the only smelter that'll handle it. They're panicked, ready to quit. They need a man who'll put heart and guts into them, a man strong enough to blast Travis and his men. They need a leader. Mr. Carter, won't you help us? Me? A vaudeville performer, a trick-shot artist? What chance would I have with a box of toy pistols against Travis and his guns? Besides, I'm a man of peace. I abominate violence. I'm sorry, sir. I wish I could have helped you. Good night. I thought I heard voices. You did. Tom used to sing that. He was singing it the last time he rode away. Was that Tom's brother? Was it Colonel Desmond, Grandpa? Was it? I don't know. I don't know. Well, did you warn him about the Yankee lieutenant? Why, no, I didn't. Anything I can do, ma'am? Oh, I... I was looking for Mr. Bixby. Well, you'd hardly expect to find him in there. That, I suppose, is meant to be amusing. Oh, I'm a very amusing fellow. Oh. Here, let me show you. Here you are. Are you interested in pistols? Not in the least. Well, that's too bad. We might've had something in common. You know, personally, I think there are only three things worth living for... fine guns, good horses and beautiful women. At least that's one item we have in common. Would you be kind enough to let me get out of here? Well, the obvious answer to that, ma'am, is why did you come in? I told you I came to see Mr. Bixby. Oh, yes, Mr. Bixby. That's right. Well, as an excuse, ma'am, that has a faint odorant of fish. You're impossible. At least it entitles me to a question. Is this your establishment? Why do you ask? Well, if it isn't, it's an awful waste of something or other for such an attractive woman to be here. Oh, well, it is not my establishment. Oh. What are you doing here? That is none of your business. Well, now, maybe it is, Lisa. Maybe he's the fellow we've been hearing about... the Reb colonel. I wouldn't try any monkeyshines with those cap pistols of yours. Wouldn't think of it. Besides, I should tell you that you've been misinformed about my military rank. It's Corporal Johnny Carter. Corporal or colonel, I got a piece of advice. I wouldn't mix in things that don't concern you. Why not? We don't like troublemakers. We got a nice little community here, chock-full of law and order, and we aim to keep it that way. We? Mr. Travis is from the sheriff's office. Oh, well, now, I'm all in favor of law and order. I'm glad to hear that, because if you wasn't, I might start remembering I never did like Rebs anyhow. Now we can talk more sociable. That was quite a shot, Mr. Carter. Yes, it was... quite a shot. It's my business... eyes closed, mirrors, upside down. You take one of these things, liable to kill people... that's no good. Here, take it. I never liked them because when you kill a man, he dies just as bad or just as stupid as the moment you put the bullet in him. But if you let him live, he's still got a chance to learn things. Well, that's smart, provided he learns the right things. Take what I just learned. You're as full of tricks as a tame crow, but tricks don't mean much in a showdown. Face to face, it's speed... how quick you can throw out pieces of lead like this. Yeah, that's a point. Ma'am. Yes. I hope you'll honor my performance with your presence this evening. I think I will. How about you? I'll be there. You reminded me of the old lady. All right, all right. Well, Mrs. Desmond, are you here for the show? No, I'm not. If it's a church benefit, I've got tickets coming out of my ears. Oh, no, it isn't. I came to see one of the entertainers. By the name of Carter, I'll bet. Why, how did you know? Oh, I had a husband once looked something like him. Drawed gals the way molasses does flies. He's in there by the stage getting ready for his act. Could I speak to him? Sure, go right ahead. Thank you. Mr. Carter. Yes, ma'am. Could I speak to you for a moment? Why, certainly. I'm Mrs. Desmond... Mrs. Thomas Desmond. How do you do? Well, perhaps the name doesn't mean anything to you, but if it does, I... I just want to warn you. There's trouble here... a Union officer looking for Colonel Desmond. A Union officer? Yes, sir. Could that be the one standing there? Your bet. Oh, dear, I'd better go. Oh, not on my account, please. No, really, I'd better leave. Hey, ain't you going the wrong way, sweetheart? I'm going out. Hey, come on, have a drink with me. Please, let me go! Oh, come on. Oh, come on, princess, we got business at the bar. Let me go! Why be so stubborn? Please! A couple of drinks won't... I'd count it a privilege, Mrs. Desmond, if you'd let me escort you home. Why, I appreciate your kindness, Lieutenant... If it's not wanting to be seen with me, well, I can walk ten paces behind. I don't suppose even your grandfather would object to that. No, I... I don't suppose he would. Take back the heart that thou gavest What is my anguish to thee Take back the freedom thou cravest Leaving the fetters to me Drink deep of life's fond illusion Gaze on the storm cloud and flee Swiftly through strife and confusion Leaving the burden to me. Thank you, Marie. Lisa. Come in. Well. Do you like my dress? This time I'm asking permission. And again you're being refused. Couldn't be you're dressing up for that Carter? I always like to look as well as possible. What do you make of him, Lisa? I don't know. Why? Kind of like to find out if he's up to anything or not. Why not wait and see? Well, I'll tell you, not waiting is the main reason I'm around today. Found that out during the war, when it was shoot or get shot. Found out a lot of things. Take what the fellow said about not killing people so they can learn. He's wrong. Is he? The important thing is to stay alive so you can learn. That sounds reasonable. It is. And I'll tell you an even more reasonable thing I found out. What? You never have to dodge bullets from a dead man. You're being too serious for a man who's come to take me downstairs. What's that? Let's see. Six less pipes in the world. And now, to assist me in my final and most prodigious feat, I need the services of a volunteer. Volunteer. Professor? Volunteer. Professor, would you oblige? Yeah. Volun... Who, me? I guarantee you won't get hurt. I hope his eyes are in good shape. I... I won't get killed, will I? Not this time. Just stand there. Take this ball in your right hand and hold it up. Who're you waving at? I... I'm nervous. Just hold it there. Now, with this small caliber pistol... and with the aid of this mirror, I shall endeavor to smash the globe. Professor? Yeah? I shall count three, and on the word "three," I shall fire. You... you'll count to three? Yes. Are you ready? Oh... uh, yes. One, two... Quite a shot. Kinda evens the score, doesn't it, Carter? It does indeed. My compliments. And my compliments to you, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you, Professor. By the way, would you like to become a permanent member of the troupe? I, uh... I see your point. Ladies and gentlemen, it seems that my performance this evening has been concluded for me. Miss Roselle, may I have the honor of joining you? If you like. Thank you. Suppose one of those toy guns of yours could sting a man a little. Oh, kill him in the right place. Think so? I do. Ma'am, you look as if you'd just stepped from a Mardi Gras cotillion. You've been in New Orleans? My favorite city. I was there once. Never liked it myself. Well, perhaps you didn't go to the right places. Do you remember those wonderful restaurants, charming people, the Comus Ball? How does a vaudeville performer happen to attend a Comus Ball? Oh, vaudeville performers enjoy such things, ma'am. They enjoy good food, pleasant surroundings, dancing and... beautiful ladies. If that's the case, what are you doing here? Talking to a beautiful lady. Well, that I grant. But if you can perform in such fancy places, why Coppertown? As I told Miss Roselle, I was persuaded to come. A while ago, I was talking to Bixby. He was wondering how you happened to be so handy when his Italian singer walked out. Says it wasn't five minutes later that you showed up. Travis? Yeah? They're comin', just down the street. Maybe we can talk some more later. Your friend doesn't seem to like me. No, he doesn't. That's odd. But then, you're odd, too. You wondered how I happened to attend a Comus Ball. I might ask you the same thing. I never have. Travis... Keep away from me. Is there going to be any trouble? You heard what I said... keep away from me. We'd better stay out of this. Come on. Now's the time to make your play, Colonel, with that fancy shootin' of yours... while they ain't expectin' it. My gun's right by your hand. No, I don't hold with violence, Sergeant. I reckon I got the wrong man. Where's Travis? Right over here, Bassett. I come to give you warnin', Travis. Do you hear me? I've come to give you warnin'. Go ahead. If you ain't out of town by sunup, I aim to hunt you down and shoot you with this... Professor, play some music, and play it loud and fast. Calm down. Lisa. You saw what happened... strictly self-defense. I saw three men shot in the back. She's right. Like as not the governor'll send someone down here to investigate. Then where'll you and Lisa be with your copper mines? I wish I could change your mind. But what have I to stay for now? They're all gone, all of them except the youngest here. I'm takin' him back home, where he'll have a chance to learn how people can live together without killin' each other. But Mrs. Bassett, I've got a plan for getting the ore through to Mesa City. Now, if you and the others will only wait a few days. We've waited too long already, Mr. Roberts. Good-bye. Good-bye, Mrs. Bassett. Good-bye, Rufe. Good-bye. Sergeant, take charge. All right, son. I'm, uh... I'm deeply obliged to you, Lieutenant, for giving them escort. Well, I'm glad to be of some assistance, sir. Good day, ma'am. Good day, Lieutenant, and thank you. Unless my plan works, the others are going to be leaving, too. Scamper, I want you to get to town. Take a message to Mr. Carter. I'll get it there just as fast as I can, sir. You see, it's less than 30 miles to Mesa City. Not much of a haul, provided nobody tries to stop the ore. I was going to have the men start at daybreak. By nightfall they'd be there. Then as soon as it was dark, they were to double back and cut off onto the Old Red Creek Trail. Yes, but look, Red Creek Trail runs mostly in a canyon. There's a dozen places for an ambush. A scout could bring the men over from the main road in plenty of time to catch the wagons. What would you do? I'd go the regular way. Look at the terrain... there's only one place for an attack, right here. But an attack is what we're trying to avoid. Sure, but if one comes, you'll be fighting it on ground of your own choosing. Still, leaving at daybreak would get them there after dark and that's no time to be ambushed. Well, let everyone think you're leaving at daybreak, then leave at midnight. Might even get through without a fight. If we follow your plan, Mr. Carter, will you consent to come along? Well, I... I'll be wishing you success. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to get back to the Rainbow. You're leaving us now? Yes, I have some work to do. He's got some work to do. Good-bye and good luck. It was a mistake asking him here. His plan doesn't sound so bad, but after all... By golly, I got it. What? Know how Colonel Desmond won - the Battle of Maple Ridge? - No. Let it be known he'd attack at daybreak and then hit 'em at midnight. The same thing. Just about time. Well, hello, Travis. Hello. It couldn't be the 31st of February, could it? Do you think it ever will be? What do you think? I'll tell you what I think: She's no good for you. You two don't belong together. You're different... like whiskey and champagne. I'll be seeing you. Cora... any day of the month is all right with me. Still set for midnight? Yeah. They're still figurin' on him goin' along. All right, get going. Do you want your dress now, Miss Lisa? Yes, please. Lisa? I thought I told you not to come up here. Just wanted to talk to you about your elegant friend. Seems he's got the Rebs convinced he's Colonel Desmond. What do you mean? He's taking charge of their ore train. Changed their plans so they're leaving at midnight, and told them he'd ride with them. Where'd you find that out? Oh, I got friends around. Thought you'd be interested in how he pulled the wool over your eyes. But don't worry... I'm meeting them with a dozen men instead of three. This is supposed to be a business, not a war. Mr. Henderson's orders were only to watch and to report. And make sure the Rebs don't get prosperous. Yes, but in a legal way. Nothing was said about using violence. Now, Lisa... All we're going to do is scare 'em a little... them and your friend. What about him? The Rebs might make a fight of it if he's along. Wouldn't do... not when they're on their last legs. Best thing is to convince him not to go. It's going to be interesting to see how he acts when the chips are down. Heard tell he was a regular fire-eater. What are you going to do? Depends on what he does. How come you're so worried? Couldn't be you're soft on him, could it? No, I'm not soft on him. Well, that's good, because I wouldn't like to think of your grieving over him... case he gets hurt. Evening, Sheriff. Seems like you enjoyed the show. Oh, that I did. And I enjoyed your act, too, Mr. Carter. You know everybody's talking about how wonderful you are. Thank you, Sheriff. You know, I heard something about you today, too, but, of course, I didn't believe it. Huh? What did you hear? Well, I heard that you had absolutely no say in appointing those deputies of yours, that Travis and the others just walked into your office and pinned the stars on themselves. Wasn't that way at all. I got well paid for takin' em on. Well, I guess certain people got a lot of money to spend. Yes, they have. Guess they got a right to spend it any way they... Say... why are you so interested? Oh, just idle conversation. Yeah? Hello, Lisa. Want to play? No cheating? All right. Ma'am, you're as lustrous as Cinderella tonight, but unlike her, you appear at the stroke of 12:00. I hope I don't disappoint you. On the contrary. You're mighty glib with those pretty speeches of yours. Where'd you get 'em? Oh, make 'em up. That's interesting, because I've kinda taken a dislike to 'em. Many people have. And to you, too. That's not impossible. Don't provoke easy, do you? No. Maybe this'll do it. Can I borrow your handkerchief, Sheriff? Thank you. Now, if you people will excuse me, I have several things to take care of. Good night. I gave him his chance. What are you going to do with somebody like that? I think I know. You think this'll hold him? Yes... with a little help from me. I don't like this idea of yours, but I guess it'll do. The ore train starts at midnight. We'll have to leave by 3:00 at the latest if we're gonna head 'em off. How'll I know if he's here? I'll signal from the window. At 3:00. At 3:00. Don't forget... this is business, not pleasure. I won't forget. Ten past 12:00. We'd better be startin'. But Carter ain't here yet. Likely he's plannin' to join us along the way. Give 'em the word, Zack. Let's get in the wagons. Hey, Bill, do me a favor, will you? What is it? Take this critter to Mesa City and find somebody to have him for five dollars. Who'll pay five dollars for that? Who said "pay"? The five's for takin' him! That's a lot of money. Not alongside of the baccy I'd save! All right, I'll take him. Head on! More of that champagne stuff. They must be washing in it! Nothing wrong with that. Come in. Well, look who's back, my friend, the champagne man! Put it right down here. And accept this with my compliments. Thank you. You want any more, Lisa? This will be enough, thank you. There is never enough! As the poet Horace said, "From Sabine jars bring forth the sparkling wine." But we have no Sabine jars. No matter, no matter at all. Ma'am, it's very interesting, the things you told me about New Orleans. I guess it must have been pretty bad there after the war. It was. I bet you could've married a rich carpetbagger. Maybe, or maybe I could have become a seamstress. But I preferred coming west. I really wanted to go to San Francisco. Oh, why? I was told about a building there that could have been made into a theater for plays, or even opera, but that required $20,000. Well, I'd hardly think Coppertown would be the place to get that kind of money. You know, I've been telling you my life history, and you haven't said a thing about yourself. Oh, it's a very dull subject, ma'am. The history of a trick-shot artist? It's filled with such things as gunpowder, bullets, trajectory, recoil. I'm sure we can think of something livelier. For instance? Well, I could tell you, and in great sincerity, that you're one of the two most beautiful women I've ever met. Who is the other? Ah-ah, that's not a sporting question. Why not? Well, one of these times I'm going to meet another beautiful woman and I'm going to say to her, "I think that you're one of the three most beautiful women I've ever met." And she'll say to me, "Who were the other two?" And how would you like it if I said, "Oh, Miss What's-Her-Name and an angel out of heaven named Lisa Roselle." There's nothing wrong in saying that. Ah, well, it isn't what I say, it's the way I say it. Am I still being dull? Mmm... amateurish, I'd say. Mmm. Still amateurish? Well... Three o'clock. Oh, yes... 3:00. Where are you going? My... my maid is in the other room. Well, send her away. Yes. I'll have another little pick-me-up. I think it would be nice... Johnny! Johnny, come back! They'll kill you! Should we open up on them now? No, I want them further along. Cuttin' them in half is the only way we can beat them. Too many of them otherwise. Whoa! Looks like we run into an ambush ourselves. No use tryin' for that ore train now. Let's get that fellow on the ridge. Wonder what happened. Somebody got behind them and drew them off. I think we better get movin'. His horse is tiring. We'll follow him down the canyon. So he was smart enough to stake out another horse. But I got a good idea who he is. Let's get back to town. Why, hello, Mrs. Desmond, Lieutenant Ord. Good morning. Good morning. Nice day for shopping, isn't it? Yes, isn't it? Why, he didn't go. That's very strange. I heard the rumors, too. Heard he was leading the ore train as Colonel Desmond. Well, he doesn't act like Colonel Desmond. Hello. This is an unexpected pleasure, ma'am. Hardly expected you to be up before noon. Where have you been? Oh, out strolling. It's nice out. I mean last night, after you left me. Why, in bed, ma'am. Where else? I told you champagne makes me sleepy. You're lying. I was in here. I was in here a dozen times! Oh. Too bad I missed you. Should have told you, though... I walk in my sleep. You met up with that ore train, didn't you? Didn't you? Ah-ah, temper, temper. You don't want to get lines under those beautiful eyes. You fool! Save that grin for the undertaker! Oh, Johnny! Johnny, it's no good for you here, no good at all. The hours I've been waiting, knowing where you've gone! They're too much for you, too many. You saw what they did to Bassett... shot him in the back. And they'll do the same to you. If it isn't Travis, it'll be some Yankee soldier. They'll shoot you for a thousand-dollar reward. See, Johnny, I know who you are. You... you must go now! Oh... I must go. So that's it? It took you long enough to make the point, but you finally got there. And believe me, it was quite an oration. For a while there, you had me on your side. Johnny, it isn't what you're thinking at all. It's just that I... You don't trust me! You think it's a trick to get you away, don't you? Johnny, you've got to leave! Or otherwise? Guess we finally caught up, Carter. Stand away from him, Lisa. What'd you do with your rifle? Rifle? Don't happen to have one. You did this morning. You'd better break down and admit it. I'd be glad to, if I had anything to admit. How about it, Lisa? When did he come in? When did he come in?! He hasn't left the hotel all night. Travis. What do you want? Mr. Henderson wants to talk to you now. Mr. Henderson? Yes, he just got here and he'll be wanting to talk to you, too. Don't you worry, Mr. Carter... I'm going to get around to you yet. Thanks for what you did for me. But it doesn't make sense... any sense at all. We leased this hotel and saloon, put you in charge, and engaged Mr. Travis and his men to assist you, all at considerable expense. We did this to secure the mines. I know, Mr. Henderson. Now we learn a consignment of ore has slipped through to Mesa City, and that there's dissension between you and Mr. Travis. There is dissension, because I object to the use of violence! Well, one could hardly refer to the actions of the constituted authorities as violence. I can and I do, and so will the governor if I'm forced to appeal to him. Appeal to the governor! Come, come, Miss Roselle, isn't that rather a dangerous thing to do? Surely you must realize that for whatever has happened here... for whatever violence... you are equally responsible with us. And another thing... by the terms of our agreement, it was specifically... I remember perfectly. It was specifically agreed that whatever was to be done was to be done peacefully, without violence... without bloodshed! You haven't kept your promise, Mr. Henderson. Wait a moment. Doesn't it seem a pity, with your job so nearly finished, that you should sacrifice the money we guaranteed you? After all, you know, you still have your obligations. It seems I haven't made myself clear. I'll put it this way. You have failed to live up to your promises. From now on, I feel perfectly justified if I fail to live up to mine. Don't give her a thought. You know how women are. There isn't much more Lisa could do anyways. Time has come for me to take over. Leave it to me and by tomorrow, we'll have these Rebs on the run. Look, here's how it's going to be... tonight's big doin's... a dance. The whole town will be there. Well, it's going to be this easy. Left to your partner, reverse allemande Right to your corner, right and left grand Whirl them right and whirl them wrong Straighten them out and trot them along First and third form a star Right hand across, "How do you do?" Left hand back, and "How are you?" Swing to your home, take up the slack Ladies to the center back to back Gents go around the outside track Swing that lady round and round Right and left through when you come down Hold your hands and all be gay Take your lady in a half sashay Elbow hook one time round Number one arch, they're comin' to town Hold his hand and duck down low And dive for the oyster, don't be slow I'll swing yours, you swing mine Swing her home, you're doin' fine... He sure has gall, a-comin' here. And with her! Maybe we shouldn't be havin' the dance anyway... least not till we hear from the ore train. Why, it's the regiment's ninth anniversary, Scamper, and the best way of showin' them we're not licked. Swing that lady with a double elbow Right and left and don't be slow Promenade one and all... What's that Yankee horse thief a-doin' here? Scamper, Caroline and I invited him. Thought it was about time we became part of the United States again. Maybe you got something there, Mr. Roberts. Center couples stop and swing Outside couples, same old thing Dosey now around your pet Balance there, you're not through yet Swing with a double elbow Right and left and don't be slow Glide right, glide along Stop that glide, you're goin' wrong Glide to the left and don't be slow Honor your partner before you go. Thank you, ma'am. That was most delightful. Thank you. May I get you some refreshments? Thank you again. Will you excuse me? Yes. Mr. Carter. Yeah? Newton and some of the fellows from the ore train just rode in and they want to see you before anybody else. It's important. Where are they? Outside. They're right out here. They don't want anybody to see them on account of they... Take him back to the corral. Quick! Mr. Roberts! We made it! The ore's sold, and the wagons are on the way back. That's wonderful! We got $1,600 for it. Took it to your house for safekeeping... figured you'd divide it tomorrow. It'll be the greatest pleasure of my life. We'll tell the folks right now. Ladies and gentlemen... an announcement! Our ore has reached the smelter at Mesa City and has been sold for $1,600! Any sign of him? Of who? Mr. Roberts, naturally. Oh, no, not yet. He'll be along pretty soon, though. Sure rejoice to get all this money off my hands. Yeah, it's a lot of money. We're going to get more, lots more, the same way. About time our jinx was broken. Another week and I wouldn't have been eatin'... Where's the money? Thanks. What's the matter, Travis? You been in a fight, tryin' to protect the money. Why I haven't got a hole in my skull, I'll never know. How long were you unconscious? Must have been at least an hour. Oh, that's why Miss Roselle couldn't find you. She's been up here several times. She has? Oh! Now, there's a gal that's as smooth as a wet eel, but a lot easier to look at. Looks like we got here just in time. Didn't think we'd move so quick, did you? What are you talkin' about? See if you can find the money. Just a second! Take it easy, Carter. Guess I'll have to. Hello, Lisa. What's going on? Suppose you tell me! Johnny Carter's in real trouble. He took money from the Southerners... $1,600. I don't believe it! It's true. We got a witness! I got a good look at him just before he knocked me out. Here's the money, Travis. Found it in his gun case. Well, that kind of clinches it, Lisa. Looks like Miss Roselle's at a loss for words, although up to now, I must admit she's given a wonderful performance. Well, Johnny, I guess you better pack your things and come off to jail. You'll like it, it's real peaceful. It's easy enough. I can ride to the fort, secure a federal warrant and have you out of here before dark, if you'll just admit you're Colonel Desmond. I don't see the percentage in that, Lieutenant. Well, it's better than being killed. In here? You wouldn't be the first prisoner that's been shot trying to escape. Can't you just say you're Tom's brother, even if you're not? No, afraid I can't. Besides, I'd kind of like to see that $1,600 get back to its original owners. It's odd a man would worry about that and not worry about the $20,000 that was taken from a federal safe. Well, it might be that the man who took the 20,000 was just getting back what was taken from him when he was captured. That could be. As far as our money goes, Mr. Carter, you can't touch it. Travis has impounded it... says it might be a year before it's released, and even tomorrow would be too late. Everybody's packing, getting ready to leave this afternoon, even Grandfather. Does Balfour know you're leaving? I don't know. Will you do something for me? Have him come down here and see me. I can try. I believe I can persuade him, Mr. Carter. Will you do it right away? Yes, sir. I'd like to escort you home, ma'am, but you understand, I'd best ride up to the smelter. If you could help in any way, I... I'd be eternally grateful. That's what I'm counting on, ma'am. I'm not quitting, now or later. The stake's too big and I'm in too deep. And so are you, Lisa. Whether you like it or not, we're in this thing together. And I've got an idea you're going to like it, once Carter's taken care of. You're not doing anything more to him. No? Remember what I told you once about never having to dodge bullets from a dead man? Well, that still goes. We'll see. It's no use going to Henderson. As of last night, I'm in charge here, and if I have to prove it, I will. Who's that? It's me. What do you want? The Desmond girl and her lieutenant's been talkin' to Carter. Yeah? Now the lieutenant's on the way to Balfour. Have Bart round up the boys, then you and I'll ride up to the smelter... just in case. Don't get in my way, Lisa. It says it plain in the Book, Mr. Carter. It says, "I will take all the families of the North "and bring them against this land and the inhabitants thereof." It said that about two nations, Mr. Balfour. Now, these people are no different than the people of the North. They worship the same God, read the same Bible. They killed my son. But they lost sons, too, and husbands and brothers. Oh, I know you feel unhappy about the Bassetts being killed, but I'm sure that in some way you must feel responsible. How could not buying their ore make me responsible? But if you'd buy, there'd be no more trouble. I swore I'd never deal with them. Suppose I quote a little, too... from a man on your side... Mr. Lincoln: "Let us strive to bind up the nation's wounds, "to do all which may achieve "a just and lasting peace among ourselves, with malice towards none, with charity for all." What are you doing here? Visiting. Get out... both of you! Who's going to protect you from the Rebs if we get out? I won't need any protection. From now on, I'm going to buy from them just the same as anybody else! Don't think so, Balfour, on account we've closed the smelter. On what grounds? We'll think of some. I'm beginning to see how blind I've been. I'll appeal to the governor, Mr. Travis, and in the meantime, I'll offer the Southerners financial aid! Johnny. Johnny! What are you doing here? Open the door. You've got to leave. But I hadn't thought of leaving. You've got to! You've got to get out of town! Get out of town? Let's not go into that again. It's gettin' monotonous. Listen to me. This is your last chance! Your interest in me, ma'am, is positively touching. How stubborn can you be? Tonight they are planning to kill you! You know, you sound mighty convincing, ma'am, but I guess I'll stay here. They have too many people being killed escapin' from jails. Mr. Carter, Mr. Carter! What's the matter? Trouble! Balfour's dead... shot in the back by Travis. And now they're buying up our claims at ten dollars apiece. Where are they doin' that? At the Rainbow... Travis and some fellow from Denver. Meet me around in front. Yes, sir. I guess I'll have to reconsider that escape, ma'am. Johnny! There's a horse outside, with money and provisions in the saddle bag. Head for California. I'm sorry I can't oblige, ma'am, but I've got some business with some friends of yours. Scamper! Yes, sir. The night the Bassetts were killed, you offered me your gun. I'll take it now. That's what I've been waitin' to hear! Oh, no, Johnny, don't! What can I say? What can I do to make you believe me? Look at me! Can't you trust me? Frankly, no. Sign here. Next. Right on this line. Next. Just a second! Sorry to spoil your fun, my friend. What do you mean? Stay where you are, Sheriff. I mean the sale has been called off. Well, you're a little late, Carter. Yes, I already have more than two-thirds of the claims. Not anymore! I don't know who you are, but I'm quite sure you'll regret this... this illegality! There's nothing illegal about changing your mind. Well, that's debatable, and I doubt if these people have changed their minds. They know it will be months, perhaps years, before they can sell their ore. Oh, why? The smelter's been closed, pending investigation of Mr. Balfour's death. Well, look who broke out of the jailhouse. Carryin' a gun, too. Hear you've been using yours today, Travis. Must be a specialty of yours... shootin' people in the back. So I'm going to give you a chance at mine. Joe, give me a beer. Coming up. What are you going to do now, Carter? No more tricks, huh? That's good, because I'm going to call your play. Kick that gun over here. Come on, kick it over! Now get against the wall. You see Travis? He just passed me at a gallop. He's probably gone to the smelter. Yeah, that's where his gang is. Well, looks like a job for Roberts' Raiders. There's a pack of men out there. Be like attacking a fort. Mr. Carter? If my men go, will you take command? Gladly, sir. How many men will ride? Somewhere around 40, I think. That's enough for two troops. - Newton! - Yes, sir. You take command of the first troop, and... Sir, I request permission to lead the second. In that uniform, Lieutenant? I just gave myself 24 hours' leave, sir. Permission granted. Gentlemen, I suggest we all meet at Mr. Roberts' house. You'll be wantin' a bugler! That we will. Lisa, would you allow me to apologize? Of course, Johnny. I'd like to express my gratitude. When I come back, if I can find the words, there are a lot of things I want to say to you. Will you be here? Come back safely. Don't worry. Prepare to mount! Mount! Forward! Ho! All right, take your men and fan out in front. Let's go! More than likely they'll turn tail at the first shot. Yeah? Well, supposing they don't? We've got a surprise for them. Bat, show him our surprise. Blasting powder. All right, fan out! Sergeant! Yes, sir! Looks like we got them on the run, Lieutenant. Sound recall! Both columns in force! Forward ho! Ya-hoo! Whoo-whoo-whoo! We'll never make it. I'm afraid he's right, sir. I tell you what you do: Dismount half your men, maintain a continuous fire from this area, and in five minutes' time with the rest of your men, charge again, you understand? Yes, sir. Right. Come on, giddy up! I think our five minutes are up. Like suicide to charge now. They're bound to have more powder. Our orders were to charge and I propose to follow them. We're with you, Lieutenant. I think they're going to charge again. Get more blasting powder. You might as well give up! You're surrounded! Drop your guns! Go on, get out of here! Get over in there! Where's Travis? In there. Shall we take the prisoners back to town, sir? - Yes. - Yes, sir. Lieutenant, you did a fine job for us. Thanks. From the commandant at the fort, sir. The sergeant thought it might be urgent. Tell Mr. Carter I'd like a word with him. Mr. Carter just rode away, sir. Giddy up! Hup! Hup! Whoa! Hold it! Where do you think you're going? - Sacramento. - Los Angeles. Well, make up your minds. Well, uh, it really was San Francisco. Look, here's $200. Get me an engagement ring... the best it'll buy. It'll be a pleasure, Lieutenant. Why, congratulations. Thank you, Miss Lisa. And here's a nail I bent to the exact size. And now, Mr. Carter, it'll ease my conscience if you'll get the blazes out of here. My congratulations, too, Lieutenant. It's "Captain," now, Scamper. Just got the news. Well! Here we go. Any special plans? Well, I'd still like to open that theater if I could raise the money. $20,000, wasn't it? Mm-hmm. You know, by a strange coincidence, I happen to have just that amount in the lining of my gun case. A gift from an uncle in the North. Well... maybe I should marry the uncle. Oh, no. Oh, no!
