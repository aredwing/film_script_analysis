How do you feel? Better. Good, that's what matters. First of all, you'll receive a medal for serving your country. Don'! want a medal for killing civilians. Well, they looked like civilians, that's true. But later we discovered they were a terrorist cell. It was a normal family. Look. We found an arsenal in the house. Your partner Diego Arranz confirmed it in his report. Where is Diego? haven't been able to talk to him. He's okay. He's shaken up by what happened but that's normal. We'll forget about the medal. Talked to Angela about the other issue. You'll receive monetary compensation. All you have to do is sign the confidentiality agreement. Confidentiality agreement? Very well. We'll see each other again another time. He said they found weapons, that they were terrorists. - Did you hear him? - was there, know what saw. Won't take their fucking money. You're recovering. You still don'! remember what happened. Besides, Diego confirmed it. They're lying- Okay, then don'! take the money. But don'! fight them. What are you talking about? You're a soldier, you can'! do as you please. Your job is at stake. Won't sign it. My unemployment runs out in 3 months and haven't found work. How will we survive? What will we do? This can'! be about money. We killed a family. Your family is right here. You care more about an Iraqi family than your own. Pablo, whatever you do, you can'! change what happened. What happened was awful but it can'! be fixed. You have to accept it. Killed a boy and his father. How can accept that? Pilar, what are you doing there? Go to your room. Don'! want to. Go to your room! Were you listening? You're shouting. I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm sorry, baby. Come on, let's go to your room. No, you must have misunderstood, sweetie. Pablo? Pablo? Pablo! Pablo! Diego... Diego, it's me, Pablo. Come up. Diego? How are you? Fine, you? Fine. Angela, Pilar? They were scared but they're okay now. Why haven'! you called me? They said not to bother you. They insisted it was the best thing for you. - Want a beer, rum? - No. Well, do. Don'! even remember it all. We killed a family, Diego. They'd have killed us. It was bad luck, that's all. Why are they insisting they were terrorists? Because nobody wants to get in trouble. This version is easier to understand. They're protecting us. How did you get me out of there? It's okay. God...! Hang in there. Hang in there. We have different blood types. Had to gamble and it worked. Killed him and now I have his blood inside me. I'm alive thanks to him. No, you're alive thanks to me. What happened after? What? - How did you get me out? - They found us. - Who? - Our guys. Armored car, ambulance, don'! remember. We're alive, Pablo. You're alive, damn it. That was our mission. To do what we could and come back alive. You're not telling me everything. Minutes before the attack in Karbala, a Spanish convoy was crossing the area on a routine mission. The second attack was in Baghdad where Shiites were celebrating the Day oi Ashura, the most sacred holiday... Why the hell are we over there? We sent an army to invade a country that did nothing to us. We always follow the Americans like idiots. - Whose idea was it? - The politicians. We'd be better off without politicians and soldiers. Without soldiers? Yeah. We'd have less problems. If it weren't for the army, you wouldn't be enjoying that drink. - Wouldn't? - No. Why? Because you need someone to protect you. Don't need anyone to protect me. - You don't? - No. You sure? I'm sure. don't know about you. You don'! need protection? What about now? We risk our lives for you! - Stop, damn it! - Okay, okay. We risk our lives for you! Leave it didn't know who to call. We'll find him. I'm sure he's fine, you'll see. But you have to help me convince him. You saw yesterday, tried everything because this deal is your family's only way out. Know you know that, but he doesn't want to realize. If you help me, together we can make him listen to reason. Look, Angela. He could be accused of false testimony and disloyalty, he could be discharged, lose his license to practice... Or even worse, he could end up in prison. Neither of us want that. Nobody does. We have to make him listen to reason. Yes. Will you call me when you see him? Of course. That stupid fucking faggot! Carlos, listen. The bastard took off. Have the police trace him and chech the hospital. I'M handle the other one. Okay. Let's go. Have the police trace Pablo Garre's plates. MEDICAL RECORDS Hey. OFFICES MEDICAL RECORDS FOUND WITH A GROUP OF INSURGENTS EXPLOSIVES AMERICANS - You like fishing? - Very much. Go almost every day. What did Pablo tell you? Yes, know he was here. Nothing. We had a drink and he left. Where to? Don'! know. If you two keep this up, you'll lose everything, including your deal. Why? What signed has nothing to do with him. It doesn't? It has everything to do with it. One moment. What is it? What? Did he see you? Hold on a second. Call me if you hear anything. Call me. Relax. Think know where he might go. I'll call you back. This is Diego Arranz' answering machine. Please... - Hello. Jesus Gaza? - Yes, speaking. - It's Nacho, Nacho Vara. - Hi, Nacho. What's up? You said to call you if needed anything. Sure, let's hear it. Well, it's just... Look, need to be reinstated right away. Right. can'! take it here any more. - Understand, no problem. - Okay. I'M have someone get in touch with you. Great. - Thanks. - Okay. Room for one more? What are you doing here? I'm just casting off. Good. Any room? Don'! think it's a good idea. What, you can'! take a friend for a ride? Are you getting dizzy? - Still get seasick? - Drive slowly just in case. Go on, grab a beer. That's the bait. You said a Spanish unit rescued us but read your report and you mentioned American soldiers as well. - Didn't tell you? - No. Must have forgot. You also said there were 11 bodies and only remember 3. Look, I'm going to find out sooner or later... Look at me. - Look at me. - This isn't a mission. I'm talking to you as your friend, not your superior. Come here, Pablo. Hey. It worked. - Are you alone? - My captain is inside. Managed to stabilize him but he needs a hospital. - There are 3 dead Iraqi civilians. - We need help here. It's very urgent, sir. Let me confirm the route and we'll take him to the hospital. Who are these people? - We captured them on the way. - It wasn't them. We'll see. Pablo... Who planted the bomb? What bomb? We don't know what you are talking about. Who planted the bomb? We didn't do anything. We didn't do anything. We don'! know what you're talking about. We're innocent. Praise Allah! Praise Allah! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Don't kill me. recorded it. I've got it on tape. It's all here. You see why I didn't tell you? We can lose everything. Think of your family. - Am. - This is serious, you know that. If it gets out they'll destroy us. We can'! fix it. That family is dead. It's better if nobody knows, period. - We have to report it. - What? We can'! hide something like this. Someone has to pay and so do we. Are you stupid? It's a war, damn it! You'll only ruin everything. - Then why did you tell me? - So we'd be in this together. - We're not in this together. - Then we should be. - You only care about your deal. - It's all we have left. They pay us to keep quiet. So what? - Fuck you. - Why was it okay before? - Give me that cell phone. - Tell me why! This is different! We're responsible for what happened. We killed an innocent family. What would have happened if you'd followed protocol? Have you asked yourself that? It's your fault, you idiot! Why did you have to skip protocol and do it your way? - You're a bastard! - Son of a bitch! Think of your family! Where's Pablo? Did he jump? He jumped. Let's go! - Yes? - Give me some good news. - can'! yet. - You said today. - know. - This can'! go on, Gaza. - Well, we're on it. - Take care of it right away. - Of course. - Next time call want it fixed. Of course. Every time a politician takes a shit have to wipe his ass. Diego. Look, won't go into what Pablo was doing on your boat, or why you two fought, or why you didn't call me when he showed up. But something just doesn't add up. Don't understand why Pablo took off like that. He's a doctor, he's intelligent... He's a bad soldier, but he isn't stupid. He took something. What is it? Photographs? Diego, tell me what it is. Don'! know what you mean. You see? can'! trust you any more. You leave me no choice. You two killed them. I'm only trying to help you. You picked the wrong side. I'm on my side. Yeah. That's why you're wrong. We can'! let him go. Arturo. Please accompany me to the boat. Right. Hello. Have you got a charger for this? - No, I'm sorry. - It's a common model. We don'! sell chargers. I'm sorry. How long will this buy me? - On the internet? - Yeah. Pick any of them. Mom! Dad? Hi, princess. - Give me a second alone with Mom. - It's Dad. Go to your room, sweetie. Pablo, where are you? I'm sorry, couldn't call sooner. Listen to me. Leave the house right now. What are you talking about? Get your cell and wait for my call. Why? Tell me what's wrong. What are you going to do? Whatever it is, don't do it. You 'H lose your license. They'll put you in jail, Pablo. We can find another way, darling. Don't fight them. There was a massacre. They killed 8 innocent people. Executed in cold blood. If don'! report it, how can look Pilar in the face? How can look you in the face? Be careful, Pablo. Hove you, sweetheart. And love you. Hove you too. Hello, I'm Carlos Gomez, from the Ministry of the Interior. Are you Angela Perez? Yes, am. What's going on? Have orders to accompany you and your daughter. Where? Did something happen? No, don'! worry. Mr. Jesus Gaza wants to speak with you. Okay, wait a moment. Pilar! We have to go out, put on your coat. What happened over there? Go check it out. Ramon! Let'; ! Faster, Ramon! That stupid fucking homo! Ram him! Again!! - Ramon, are you okay? - Yeah. That fucking bastard! Damn it... Fuck! Whatever Diego gave you won't help. You can'! win. You've never even had a chance of winning. You think you did but now you see you didn't. Come on. Let's go. Come on, Pablo. Son of a bitch! Where is it? Here it is! What the fuck is on here? Are there copies? Are there more copies? Good. Now you'll fucking sign! Angela! - Pablo! - Pilar! Angela! - Pablo... - Angela! It's okay, baby. What are they doing here? Shut up. You can'! do this, let them go. Shut up. Here. Check it and destroy it. - Let them go and I'll sign. - Right. We'll leave that for later. Are there more copies of this video? No. Don'! believe you. Who else has seen it? Have they seen it? No. Don'! believe you. - What's going to happen, Mom? - Nothing, sweetheart. It's okay. - Your wife hasn't seen it? - No. Don'! believe you. Why do this to your family? They don'! deserve it. CARD ERASED Don't you see? You leave me no choice. Don't touch them! - Don't touch them! - Pablo! Don't touch them! Pablo! Pablo! Pablo! Don't move. Tell me if there are more copies. Yes. There are more copies. There are more copies. Let them go and I'll tell you where. No. Tell me now. No. Let them go and I'll tell you. No. Tell me. - Yes? - Put Gaza on. Yes. What? - You're kidding. Not now. - It's urgent. You have to take it. Yes? What the fuck are you doing? You better have an explanation. - Why? - You're not watching the news? Turn on the TV. This could be costly for all of us. It's the last thing we need now. The news. Our lead story tonight, we have been given access to graphic footage recorded in Diwaniyah, Iraq. The footage shows Spanish and American soldiers apparently killing Iraqi civilians. The reports remain unconfirmed. The footage was sent to the media by Pablo Garre, a Spanish military doctor stationed in Iraq... Yeah, I'm watching. This was your responsibility. - How the hell do you want me to...? - Listen to me! - You can'! touch him. - Right. We'll figure it out later. We can'! touch him now. know. Know. Near Diwaniyah The link between that attack and the allied convoy and the footage we're seeing has yet to be confirmed... Look what you're making me do! Look at me! Look at me! Look what you're making me do! Look at me! - Gaza. - Look at me, doctor shit for brains! Jesus. Look at me, son of a bitch! Jesus, stop! - You idiot, look at me! - Jesus! Look at me, doctor shit for brains! Son of a bitch! - Look at me! Look! - Jesus! Look at me, you fucking idiot! Look at me! - Son of a bitch. - It's over. Pilar? I'm in the kitchen! - Anyone calls? - No. - What are you making? - Croquettes. Like Dad taught me. The U.. Army claims the shots were fired in self-defense and has offered these images to confirm that the dead Iraqis were suicide bombers, members of a cell ready to attack at any time. The Spanish Army has backed U.. statements and adds that fighting terrorism remains their priority. This discredits Pablo Garre's version, who remains in prison awaiting trial for treason, perjury and manipulating evidence. No date has been set for his hearing. Ci" you go out? Only if you're with me, Captain.
