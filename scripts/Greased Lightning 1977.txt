Nor have we been able to apprehend this nigra. I'm not just talking about moonshine, gentlemen, No, sir. I am talking about the course That your bumbling police work Has cost the city. Not to mention the nine patrol cars That were completely demolished in the process. The mayor is rightfully upset. The treasury department is upset. I'm upset.

He drove me crazy. Sheriff, I have got a little proposition for you. I want to put that boy on my track. What? Wait just a minute. Hear me out. What are you talking about? I'm talking about filling up my stands. I'm talking about making money. I'm talking about putting that boy out, So the white folks will come to see him get killed, And the niggers... Well, hell, they'll just come out. Do you know how long it's taken me To catch that boy? What good is he doing you in jail? I'm talking about money. Let's get that boy out of jail And make some money off of his black ass. Uh... I don't know. Huh? Wendell Scott? Yeah. Who are you? Billy Joe Byrnes. I own the local race track. I just made a deal for you. What kind of deal? You race for me on my track, And I'll get 12 of the 15 counts Dropped against you. You'll get probation and a small fine. Course, you know, You've got to cross the finish line. Otherwise, you could pull Between 10 and 12 years of hard time. Why are you doing this for me? Well, it ain't 'cause I like you. You're going to put money in my pocket. We'll get people out to the track. Let me tell you something, That crowd loves the smell of blood. I don't know nothing about no racing. Ah, hell, you don't have to know anything. Just get a car. I'll give you gasoline money And a set of tires. I don't know. Look, you can be out of this jail in 30 minutes. Now you fish or cut bait, boy. I ain't got much a choice, huh? That's right. Then I guess it's a deal. I went looking for slack, But they put him on the bus to Richmond. I don't care about that. Slack's in trouble. He couldn't do nothing but what he did. I had a bondsman. You didn't have to get yourself Messed up in this crazy deal. That ain't no crazy deal, Peewee. I want to race. You call that racing, Wendell? You're just black bait. They're going to try to kill you. Quiet down. Mary don't know. It's dangerous out there. I know it is. Don't...

You're not going to moonshine again, Are you, Wendell? No. I'm racing. Racing? That's right, Mary. It cost us a lot of money To fix this car up, damn near 2 jobs. I figure we ought to get Our money's worth out of it. It doesn't matter what it cost, Wendell. What matters is you're free. Not if I ain't doing what I want to do. I've wanted to be a race car driver all my life. Are you crazy? Didn't you learn anything on that track yesterday? I damn sure did. They can't kill me, even if they try.

Yes, I took Jesus for my savior Well, we have no report yet on Roberts. Now the white flag is flying! Beau's got it. Looks like Beau Welles has himself another win With G.P. Johnson second, Arthur James third, And Wendell Scott Takes a shortcut to fourth position. See what you get for fourth place. Ain't that something? Would've had first place, except for Beau Welles. Hell with Beau Welles. I got some plans for his ass. We're on our way, Woodrow. Free steak dinner. I know you're hungry. I ain't that hungry. I don't like to eat standing up And I don't like to eat in nobody's kitchen. I got my own food. Take the car home. I'm enjoying myself tonight. Hey, you want to get your hands off that? Think you're hot shit, don't you? Yeah. What'd you get, fourth? What'd you get? I got a busted radiator, ass face. Peckerhead, I got two tickets To the colonial restaurant for dinner. They don't serve no boogies there. They're going to serve this boogie. Is that right? That's right. If you plan on getting anything to eat, Better take me along. For what? I can handle my own trouble. Trouble? Shit, we'll eat that first. What you going to pull? I'll probably pull a 5.14. 5.14 kind of light for that track. Try to run any hotter, you'll blow an engine. Go right ahead, honey. Beau Welles blew hisself up In Charlotte three weeks ago. What are you going to pull? I was thinking about pulling a 5.38. I'm sorry. You'll have to come back some other time To fix the ice box. I'm not fixing no ice box. We're here to eat. There must be some mistake. This the Colonial restaurant? Y-yes. You are from the race track. I'm sorry, but my husband is not here today. I mean that - we just don't ordinarily... I mean don't ever serve colored. What about those steaks? It does say free steak dinner. It says two. Wendell, how do you like your steak? It would have to happen... Medium-well. When my husband's not here. He's likes his medium-well. I'd like mine well-done, please. I'll get your dinners for you, But promise to eat very fast. Your waitress will be right here. You from around here? Danville. Danville. I been there. I'm a local boy myself. Born and raised. Spent a little time up in Chicago. You in the service? No. I busted my leg. I couldn't join. How did you bust your leg? You ever do any time? Damn near. I used to run liquor. Are you still moon-shining? It's disgraceful letting a nigger Eat in here with us! Who in the hell do you think you are? Don't mind that drunk. Don't mind him. It's disgraceful! Kind of hard not to. Pay him no mind. What cam you running? Who the hell are you? Are you deaf? Something stinks around here. I don't know if it's the nigger Or you, white trash. You ought to be... Oh! I got your back! Oh, lord! What's happening? Ohh! Why don't you sit down, OK? Don't worry, folks! I'll bring the plates back. Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Sorry to interrupt your eating. Just come to have dinner. Good day. That's the raunchiest steak I ever had. I think that may be dog meat. That's why they gave it to us free. Want some coke to wash it down? No, thank you. It's cool. Well... Hey, you going by the restaurant? Yeah. I'll go by. Do me a favor. - What's that? I promised that waitress I'd give her plate back. Throw this out as you pass by. Going to be able to make the next race? I think I've got the bottom in. Maybe you just threw a rod. No! I broke my crank. That's it! That's it, you old bastard! I'm done. I'm finished. Best driver on the track, And I've got a turd for a car. Maybe it ain't so bad, man. Is that right? You sure you through? What the hell do you think? Well, you won't be needing this then. That's what I think. What are you doing? Well, don't mind me. Why don't you just go ahead and help yourself? Don't let me interfere. Why don't you take my tires? You've been wanting my transmission.

You young boys don't know nothing About the civil rights movement. Man, what are you talking about? I know a man so bad That he molded civil rights. Come on. What are you talking about? Listen here for a minute. Back in 19 and 47, I knew a man so bad That when he was moon-shining, He had 10 police cars chasing after him. He blew a tire. They thought they had the nigger caught. You know what he did? What? He jumped out of the car, Ran towards the police car, Jumped over their hoods, Ran into the fields, And they ain't caught up with him since. Who you talking about, supernigger? You lie, man. If I'm lying, I'm flying. You must be flying. He's alive and kicking, Living here in Danville today. Who? Who? Who is he? Wendell Scott.
