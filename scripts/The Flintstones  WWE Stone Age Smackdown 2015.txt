Wilma deserves a nice vacation. What's the matter, Fred? I'm already late for work. Hard work, dedication, a big hammer. That's how you break rocks. You listening to me, Mr. Cenastone? Absolutely, Mr. Slate. And please, call me John. I prefer the formality of last names. Just because you're my sister's husband's nephew once removed, doesn't mean you get special privileges. No, sir. I'm here to work. Good. Because laziness is one thing I won't tolerate. - Also lateness. - I hate that. Come on, people. Some of us got jobs we should have been at 20 minutes ago. It's a livin'. These prontocranes are delicate pieces of equipment. Takes a real expert to run one of these. Hey, Flintstone! Flintstone? Flintstone, you'd better not be sleeping up there! Flintstone! Yes, Mr. Slate. I was just adjusting the, uh... Well, get back to work! Yes, sir. I will get back to it. Work. Which is what I was doing up here all this time. Help me! Hang on, Mr. Slate. I'll have you down in a jiffy. There's got to be an off lever here somewhere. That was the up lever. Oh, you think I would have figured that out by now. Now, let's see here. My bad! Only one left. Got to be it. Mr. Slate, you okay? I'm kissing granite here, Flintstone. Do I look okay? Listen. This might not be the best time, but since I have your attention, I was wondering if I could get my paycheck a little early this month? I'd promised my wife I'd take the family on a vacation. A vacation? To Rockapulco. A vacation! You almost got me killed and you want to go on a vacation! Huh? Well, after a day like today I could use some R&R. You probably could too. Dinosaur! You guys okay? Wow, that was amazing. You got some moves, kid. What's your name? Me? I'm John. John Cenastone. Good to meet you, John. - I'm Fred... - Flintstone, in my office! Now. There you go. Your paycheck. Seriously? Wow! Mr. Slate, that's awful generous. I mean after all that damage I caused, I thought you'd be mad. So you are mad. I'm just gonna go in there and tell Wilma the vacation's off. She'll understand. Wilma, I'm home! Missed me that time. Fred? Is that you? Honey, listen. There's something I need to tell you about our vacation. There's something I need to show you about our vacation. Do you like it? I got it for our trip. 60% off at Marshales. What did you want to tell me about the vacation? Uh, just that, uh... I'm definitely not canceling it because of something that happened at work today. Well, that's a relief. I can't even remember the last time we took a family vacation. Oh, no. That's Barney and Betty. We're supposed to go to the Water Buffalo Charity Carnival together and here I am standing around in my bikini. I have to get changed. Tame your pterodactyls. We'll be right out. Why don't you honk it again? I didn't hear it the first three times! You hear it that time, Fred? I can't believe you're actually going on vacation. And to Rockapulco. I know! I feel like the luckiest girl in the world. I feel like a complete idiot. Honk. Honk. You should have seen her in that bikini. I would have liked to have seen her in that bikini. Watch it, Rubble! Hey, I got an idea, Fred. Wait till you get back from vacation, then tell her about the paycheck. But, Barney, we're not going on vacation. Oh, don't tell her that, Fred. It'll ruin your vacation. Yeah! You can jump in anytime. Bamm! Bamm! Bamm! Bamm! - Whahoo, yeah! - Oh, baby! It's my turn! Wow, Nikki and Brie Boulder. So how much is a kiss? 100 clams. 100 clams? Ooh, that sounds expensive. Considering you get a kiss from each of us, it's like half off. In that case... I'll take 502. Fred Flintstone! Get out of that line! - But it's for charity. - Now. Our charity booth is all set up, Fred. I built the ring, put out the donation bucket and tied on Hoppy's gloves. Honk. Honk. Honk. Anything else you need me to do? Yeah. Tell Wilma that the trip's off. Sure thing. Hey, Wilma... Shh! Pipe down, Barn. - But you said... - I'm never telling her and you're not telling her either. I'm going to find a way out of this jam myself. That's a great idea, Fred. I haven't come up with the idea yet, Barn. But when you do, it's gonna be a good one. Step right up. Five clams and get your five minutes in the ring. Make it to the bell without Hoppy knocking you block off and win a prize! Who wants to take some licks for charity? Keep it above the pouch, all right, buddy? Honk. Honk. Honk. Honk. Honk. Honk. Honk. Honk. Honk. Next. Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk. Honk. Honk. Honk. Honk. Honk. Honk. I got this in the bag, Marble Henry. I know you do, but seriously, you can just call me Marble. I prefer the formality of last names. Honk! I'm gonna win a prize. No, no. I'm gonna win two prizes. Hey, thanks, man. Ah, they're both for me. Win your own prize. Have fun. You have fun. I'm having a great time. Thanks. Come on, you big, ugly jumping Dinorat. It's take down time! Honk. Honk. Hey, easy there, buddy. He think he's gonna send me flying? Think again. I'm CM Punkrock! And I got you a first class ticket to my fist! Uh, listen. He's real sensitive. Maybe you could cool down the pejoratives? He's crying. I made the Kangasaurus cry. Hey, mister. He's a Hopparoo. And you're being downright mean to him. Oh, what are you going to do about it, Shrimpo? I was gonna ask you to be less mean. "Less mean"? Like this? Yo, check it out, Marble Henry. He ain't so tough now, is he? He sure ain't. That's my beloved pet you're humiliating out there. I tried talking nice to you but now I got to take matters into my own hands. Oh, boy. Easy, Barn. Aroo! Honk. Honk. Aw! Honk? Uh, Fred, little help here? Looking good, buddy. I think you got him. - Is that... - Barney! That's right. I am CM Punkrock. I am the best in the prehistoric world, thanks to my straight-edge lifestyle... Oh, this raw fish business stinks! You okay, Barn? I've never seen you that worked up. I couldn't just stand there and watch him tease Hoppy like that. Hoppy, cut it out! That tickles. - Best show I've ever seen. - We should go again. I'd pay 50 clams to watch something like that again. I would pay any price to see that. That was a heck of a show, Flintstone. Heck of a show. Why, uh, thanks, Mr. McMagma. A fella could make a lot of clams with a spectacle like that. Huh? Barney Rubble, don't you ever do anything dangerous like that again! I don't plan on it, Betty. Help me up, Marble Henry. Ouch! I'm coming to bed in a minute, Betty. Just got to brush my teeth. And for this I went to college? Psst! Barney. You scared the paste out of me, Fred. I'm aware of that. What are you doing here? I couldn't sleep. I got this brilliant idea in my head. We could put on another one of those crazy matches like you did tonight and charge folks to come and see it. I promised Betty I wouldn't do anything dangerous. It ain't gonna be dangerous. It'll be entertainment, like a show. Wow. A show? I'd pay hard-earned clams to see something like that. That's what I'm telling you. If we do this, we can make enough clams to take both our families on a vacation. Betty sure would love a vacation. What the heck. I'm in. Barney, are you talking to someone? Nope. Just gargling, sweetheart. We just need to find some more guys for the show. And I think I know just where to... Start. Yabba dabba doo! Hey, Cenastone, you really showed that dinosaur who's boss yesterday. Oh, that? That was no big deal. Are you kidding? I tell you, if I had moves like that, I wouldn't be working in a quarry. Actually, Mr. Flintstone, I don't plan on breaking rocks my whole life. None of us do, kid. None of us do. Maybe music is my thing. Music? With muscles like that? Listen. Me and my pal Barney are putting together a little sports entertainment event this weekend. And you my dinosaur-throwing friend, would be perfect for it. Me? You think? Oh, I don't think. I know. Now if we could just find a few more big strong fellas like you, we'd have ourselves a show. Hmm. I might be able to help you out there. Booyaka! Yeah! 619! Thanks. No, thanks. - Daniel Bryrock, have a flyer. - No, thanks, Cenastone. I don't want your flyer. - Please, please. I insist. - I said, "No, I don't". But I think you wanna say, yes, you do. No, I don't! Yes, you do. No, I don't! - Yes, you do! - No, I don't! - Yes, you do! - No, I don't! - No, you don't! - Yes, I do! No, you don't! I say, yes, I do! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! You think that guy's coming to the event? I'm gonna say, no. Hey, watch where you're going. - Sorry about that. - You're that guy from the lodge. The one who tag teamed me with that Dinohop. Hopparoo. He's a Hopparoo. Well, I think he's a dumbaroo. And I didn't like getting kicked out of the ring. I didn't like it one bit. And now I got you right where I want you - and I'm going to give you... - Ice cream! Marble Henry! We are not giving him ice cream. We're giving him a beatdown. Everything okay, Barn? Everything's fine. Just having a little chat. As far as chats go, that one was on the intimidating side. You're ice cream's melting. Come on, Marble Henry. Let's get outta here. - You lick this one? - I can't remember. No, I licked the other one. Argh! I get the feeling that guy doesn't like me so much. Don't sweat it, buddy. We got bigger fish to fry. Fred, dinner's almost ready. Uh, honey, didn't I tell you? I'm playing poker with the boys tonight. Hey, what's cookin'? Smells delicious! Sorry I'm missing it. Got to go! Don't wait up! Fred? Yeah, Wilma? Fred? Wilma? You're not going to try to double our vacation fund in some harebrained poker game, are you? What? No! I am not gonna try to double our vacation fund in some harebrained poker game. That is a fact. Mmm-hmm. There's nothing to worry about, sweetheart. Your Freddy boy's got it all under control. When Freddy boy says don't worry, I start worrying. Yup. We are good to go, Barn. Wilma doesn't suspect a thing. You're sure no one's gonna care if we use the fairgrounds? It's empty for the season. Besides we can't just go back to the Water Buffalo Lodge. People have been there, done that. Trust me. This spot's the perfect venue for tonight's scheme. You mean "event". Right, Fred? That's what I said. Oh, sorry, Fred. I could have sworn you said "scheme." Focus. Barney. I need you givin' 111% tonight. Look at that crowd, Barney. Every one of them is worth 10 clams. We've already got enough to take the wives and kids on a week-long vacation. Yeah, now all we have to do is make them not want to ask for their clams back. Don't worry, pal. These guys are itching for action. - Uh-oh. - Huh? Wake up, wake up, wake up! Oh! Sorry, Mr. Flintstone. I pulled a double shift at the quarry today. Come on, guys. We got paying customers out there, waiting for the show of their lives. This is no time for shell phones. Hey! Or tablets. I need you guys looking tough. That's more like it! What's with this suit, Mysteriopal? You look ridiculous. Hey, my sleeve! Hey, my other sleeve! Now we're getting somewhere. I just need to do something about them slacks. How did you know I was wearing these? Uh... I didn't. Let's just consider this a lucky break. These must have been left over from the circus. Wait, Fred. Why do I need these? For your match. Whoa! No, no, no, Fred. I promised Betty... Like I said, this ain't dangerous. It's an event. - I don't know. - Think about it, Barn. Your beautiful family on the beach. Not a care in the world. The sound of lapping waves, the smell of the crisp ocean air. How can Betty get mad about that? Barney, you're the best husband ever! Bamm! Bamm! Bamm! Bamm! Okay, I'll do it. Attaboy! Are these things supposed to be this tight? They're creeping up something terrible. I hope you know what you're doing. That makes two of us. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, are you ready for action? We're about to make prehistory tonight. Two will enter the ring for the match of their lives. But only one can be the champion. It's caveman versus caveman in the ultimate sports spectacular! Flintstone might be onto something here. John Cenastone... Versus Rey Mysteriopal. All right, guys. You know what to do. Uh, Mr. Flintstone, we don't know what to do. Get out there and put a hurt on each other. But we're friends. Work with me, Cenastone. All you got to do is treat Mysteriopal like that dinosaur the other day. You toss him around a bit, get the crowd excited. Give 'em a show! Oh, a show? Right, you got it. - Huh? - Huh? What? - Hey! - Hey! What's going... Where are you going? I tossed him around just like you said. Sports entertainment is fun. - But wait! - One move and it's over? I want my clams back. - I don't believe this. - This isn't good. You got to win 'em back, Barney. - But, Fred... - But nothing. That was just an appetizer, folks. Now it's time for the main event. Battling Barney Rubble... Versus... Hey, buddy, I just realized I never caught your name. The Undertaker. Wow, that is some scary name. I don't know if I want to do this anymore. Barney, stop running! Get in there. My ears hear you, Fred, but my feet got a different idea. Let me out of here! Hmm? Uh-oh! Barney, come down from there. - No! - Get down! I don't wanna. These people paid to see some action. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Which means you've got to give 'em some action. I like it up here. Sorry, buddy. I got to do this, for the vacation. - What happened? - You pinned him, Barn. Just hold him there. One, two... Barney Rubble, what do you think you're doing? Yikes! One, two, three! Barney, you come out of that cage this instant! I don't want to come out. It's safer in here. Fred Flintstone. Hi, honey. Don't "Hi, honey" me. You raise this cage right now! Oh, boy! You look beautiful tonight, Betty. Did you do something different with your hair? Not even a little. You said you weren't going to try to double our clams in some harebrained scheme. Actually I said I wasn't going to try to double our clams in some harebrained poker game. I did, however, double our clams in a harebrained sports entertainment event. Now, we can all go on a real vacation to Rockapulco together. Is that true, Barney? This was all so we could go on vacation together? Sure was. Fred came up with the idea after he destroyed the quarry, nearly killed his boss and had his paycheck taken away. He what? Now, honey, I know you're mad, but I need you to keep something in mind. Rockapulco. Rockapulco, Rockapulco, Rockapulco. Okay, but you better not do this again. Cross my heart, Wilma. I got the vacation fund, I'm done. Come on, Barney. - That was amazing. - Best show I've ever seen. Oh, wasn't it awesome? Man, I can't wait to watch the next one. I'm going to buy a T-shirt. Flintstone, you've got yourself something real special here. Ha! Flintstone! Flintstone! Flintstone! Flintstone! Flintstone! You've got yourself something real special here. Flintstone! You know my policy on laziness. Mr. Slate, I'm sorry. I just... One more slip up from you and you're fired! But, Mr. Slate... You know what? I quit. I don't need this job anyway. I got something else going. Something special, something that's gonna make me rich. What are you slow-clapping about? Knock it off! You better get out of my way. I got a proposition for you. I got a proposition for you. Get outta our way. That's totally not a proposition, Marble Henry. - Sorry, Punkrock. - Continue, Flintstone. How would you like to get even with Barney? The guy with the Kangarino? It's a Hopparoo, but, yeah, that's the fella. What? Like a rematch? Exactly like a rematch. By the way, it's tonight at the Bedrock Arena. The rematch on live television. Call the Boulder twins. Nikki and Brie are always up for fun. Psst! Barney. Geez, Fred, ever heard of a front door? I did something, Barney. Something that's gonna make us rich. Richer than rich. I should like the sound of that, but for some reason I'm skeptical. We didn't go big enough, so we're gonna do another match tonight. I signed a contract with a television station. I rented out the Bedrock Arena and bought this fancy suit. Where did you get the clams for that? I spent the vacation fund. You did what? Barney? You've been in there a while. Everything okay? Yeah, not really. Fred, you got to get those clams back. Oh, forget it. Those clams are chump change compared to what we're gonna make tonight. No, I can't do it. I'm done. Hey, you can't be done. I haven't even told you the best part. The main event is going to be a rematch between you and CM Punkrock. That's not the best part. That sounds like the worst part. That fellow scares me. You know what your problem is, Barney? You got no vision. You're not dreaming big enough. You got clam-fever, Fred. Think about the girls. Think about the kids. Think about the umbrella drinks. You're right, Barney. You were really freaking me out. I'm going to get the clams. Good. Good, Fred. I'm gonna get all the clams. You say something? Nope, not a word. Welcome, Bedrock, to the Saturday night spectacle. A few days ago, I was just some schlub working at the quarry. But now look at me. Fancy suit, sunglasses, pinky ring. I'm swimming in clams and it's all because I didn't give up on a dream I've had for almost a week. I found the meanest, the toughest, the wildest superstars in Bedrock and they're here tonight to serve up a beatdown! John Cenastone! Rey Mysteriopal. And The Undertaker. Barney! Barney! Uh, yeah, about that, uh... Now, I know I may have said something about a rematch between Barney and CM Punkrock... But Barney couldn't make it tonight. Forget Barney. Who needs Rubble when you got me? And these guys. You can't forget about these guys. Fellas, what's the big deal? - Forget Barney? - He's your best friend. "Was" my best friend. And he's gonna be sorry when I take me straight to the top. Us. Us straight to the top. I meant us. Listen. You two are up first. But I can't have any more good-natured tickle fights. I want to see you two destroy each other. But we like each other. Not anymore, you don't. The people want drama. So from now on you're enemies who can't wait to tear each other's heads off. In a family-friendly way, of course. Mr. Flintstone, this isn't really what we signed up for. Fame, fortune. What more could you want? - Friends. - No Barney, no us. Wait. Guys. Not cool, Fred. Not cool. The Undertaker, I thought we were buds. Oh, boy. You offended your superstars, you lied to your best friend, you lost your vacation fund. Again. Fred Flintstone, you bonehead. What have you done? Where is he? Where is Rubble? That Kangahop-loving shrimpo, Barney Dumbbell may have got lucky the first time, but it looks like he's too chicken to face me again. Maybe that chicken is a turkey. Good one, sis. - We want Rubble! - Where is he? Coward! I came for a rematch and I want my rematch! Rematch! Rematch! Rematch! Rematch! Rematch! Let's get out of here. Rubble isn't going to show. Hey! Barney Rubble is my best friend, but I lied to him and told him this match was canceled. So maybe it's time I make things right and get in the ring myself. I'm gonna destroy you. Let's yabba dabba do this! I still can't believe we're all going to Rockapulco. Yeah. For once it seems like one of Fred's crazy schemes actually paid off. Uh, Betty, Wilma? You might want to see this. Fred! Oh! Dada. I didn't think he was gonna go through with it. He said he was going to get the vacation fund back. Come on, Flintstone. The people want a show. You would think our radiant hotness would be enough. Maybe we need to turn up the heat. Give the people what they want. Who are those girls? It doesn't matter, Betty. Because all the well-toned muscle and over-priced hair product in the world can't save them. This is more fun than making a Hopakang cry. He's a Hopparoo! Huh? Whoa. Did I do that? That's what I do! Pretty lights! Ah! Huh? Thanks, fellas. The Undertaker. Hi, buddy, great to see... You? You're messing with the world's strongest caveman! Rest in peace! There's only one best in the prehistoric world and that's me! Huh? Ah! Oh! This is getting ridiculous. Huh? Nobody hurts my friend. Got it, mister? - We were just... - Leaving. Barney! You saved me! Ah, Fred you would have done the same for me. I was a real jerk. If I'd have listened to you in the first place, we wouldn't have gotten caught up in all these hijinks. If it wasn't for hijinks, we wouldn't have any jinks at all. Bamm! Bamm! Bamm! Bamm! Wow. That kid's got some serious skills. Don't even think about it, Fred. I know what you're gonna say, Wilma. But I swear, this time I'm done. I'm just glad you're okay, Fred. Flintstone, where are you going? You can't leave now. This is a big time idea you've got here. I'm not looking for the big time, Mr. McMagma. I was just looking to take my family and friends to Rockapulco. Hey, why don't you take the idea? You'd be doing me a favor. Then the least I can do is send you on an all-expense paid trip. Drinks and gratuities included? It would be my pleasure. I'm going to make the biggest sports even if it takes me 65 million years. Ah, Rockapulco with my best girl and my best friends. It couldn't be more perfect. Yeah, Fred, I have to give it to you. Your harebrained scheme actually paid off. Barney, don't encourage him. He's just lucky Mr. Slate gave him his job back. He had to. Turns out clam fever was an actual medical condition. You know, when you think about it, I was a victim in this whole thing. Fred. Don't worry, Wilma. I learn't my lesson. Attention, ladies and gentlemen. The karaoke contest is about to begin in the hotel lounge. Karaoke contest? That sounds like fun. Forget it, Barn. We're here to relax. We're not getting caught up in anymore hijinks. The first place winner will automatically make it into the top 10 on this year's season of Prehistoric Idol. Your singing career starts here, folks. Should we try to stop them? Would it matter if we did? Yabba dabba doo!
