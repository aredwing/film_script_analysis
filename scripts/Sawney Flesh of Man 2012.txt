Jamie, you promised me this wouldn't happen again! Jesus! Hand it over. - Piss off. - I will if you don't hand it over. - Moan moan moan. - Right. Hey! I'm coming. Okay okay okay. Hey. Hey hey! - Take it. - Shit, Jamie. I'm sorry. Why do you do this? I don't know. Look, I'll get the car, all right? You can't drive like this. - Get in. - No. You're in no fit state to drive. Leave it. We'll get a taxi. Last chance. Get in! No. You shouldn't be driving! - Fuck you! - No. Fuck you. Asshole. Shit! Come on. Let us pray. "God of grace and peace, in Your Son Jesus Christ You have given us new birth into a living hope. Strengthen us now to live in the power of the resurrection and to keep us united with our loved ones and with all Your people in heaven and on earth from whom, in death, we are not divided." What is this enigma that we call human? What is our nature? What... defines our identity? What makes us who we are? We're animals. You had no right to publish unnecessary details about the body's condition. I gave you those details in strict confidence. Listen, Bill, she died under violent circumstances- mutilated. The public have a right to know. There is a lunatic out there. We have to stop this from happening again. Somebody out there could have some information. - That's our job. - But you haven't been doing your job! Charlotte could still be alive if you had reacted to this sooner. You only found her when she turned up in bits. Missing persons seem to be just another statistic with your lot. The police attitude is "Oh, someone's gone missing, but nobody seems to miss them." I think you should leave now, Hamish. This story will make caring parents realize the significance of the escalating problem of missing people in Scotland, because next time it's their son or their daughter or their grandchildren. What is it with you, pal? I thought we were helping each other. Just forget it. "We meet to give thanks for Charlotte, who has gone on before us into the world of God's eternal light. While we are glad for her, we feel the sadness of the parting, and our loving sympathy goes out to the whole family. And the blessing of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit be with you all, now and forevermore." Amen. Wendy. You've got a nerve turning up here. How could you write those things about Charlotte? - Drinking again? - No! You've got a sick, warped mind then. Look, I'm sorry, Wendy, okay? But it's my job. The public had a right to know what happened. The public? Charlotte was my sister and your friend. You insensitive bastard. My parents were shocked at the article. It was tasteless and heartless. - Look, Wendy, I'm sorry! - Just go! Mmm. "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He leaded me... He leaded me to lie..." Mmm. "I am the bread of life. He that cometh to me shall not hunger." "He that believeth in me shall not thirst. Mmm. He that eats this bread, shall live forever." Make sure you crush everything to a pulp before you dump it. I will check. The fruits of the Lord! Hungry! Ah. Enjoy. She was a cute young thing. God, it stinks in here. You'd better clean this place up. Make sure you get rid of all the waste this time. And no figurines! You've been warned. Ahh. You're a pretty little thing. Ooh, you're pretty. What are you looking at?! Clean this place up! It stinks! You're awake. Why not the real thing? Why not the real thing? Hello, little girl. Mmm. Yeah, but you're not as pretty as your picture, are you? No, we'll just have to taste the delights. Oh. Ah. Oh, tidy. Very very tidy- Ah. Yeah. Ah. Now if it tastes good, you get to stay alive... for a little while anyway. But if it's bad- ooh. I bet you will taste good, huh? Mmm! Ah. You taste good. Yeah. Ah, tidy. T351!/, eh? I feel a happy moment coming on. A very happy moment. Ah! The films you requested, Mr. MacDonald. - Ah. Right. Thank you. - Thanks. Article dating back from 1970. Comparisons similar to Charlotte's case. Tormhorr? What the hell is this? Huh? Bill? I know. I... I tried... You know? Well, why didn't you prevent it? He's taking this personally. He knows the deceased, sir. Oh, he's a friend of yours, is he? No. Well, I wouldn't go as far as to say that. I want this Hamish MacDonald off our backs. And what kind of name is that for an Englishman anyway? Well, his old man came from here. You should see him drink. He's got Scottish blood in him, all right. I don't care. This doesn't look good. The chief's breathing down my neck. He wants results. This journalist's going into missing persons in great detail. We're getting public enquiries dating back years now. They could take civil action against us. I want him stopped. I'm working on it. Work fucking harder, will ya? Give him something, anything, to make him think we'll cooperate with his enquiry. No more incriminating headlines, you understand? I may have something. You're on a slippery slope, Bill Munro. Make it work. Yes sir. Ah. Hamish. This is not the sort of thing that goes down too well with my superiors, you know. Usual, Hector. - Drink? - No. I'm on duty. Ah. Anyway... I'm sorry about being flippant with you the other day. - It was just... - Flippant? You mean being an asshole. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry, Bill, but me and Wendy, you know, and this whole thing with Charlotte- it's not another story. It was Wendy's sister and she was a friend of mine. What happened to her... I mean, Jesus Christ! We've got to catch the bastard who did this, Bill. So we're on level pegging again, huh? Look... everything I discuss with you - is confidential. Hmm? - Yeah, of course. Let me get you a drink. Still on the heavy water, hmm? I'm fine. Later. Listen... off the record, I've never told you this... and I mean... I've never told you this... but when we discovered the remains of Charlotte McIntyre, it was like no other find we'd ever had before. Look at this. Yeah, I know. I've already seen this. It's not pretty. Her decomposed head and feet were all we found of her body and we had to identify through dental records and DNA. What do you mean, her head and feet? What about the rest of it? What about her arms, her hands, the other bits? That's it. They're not hers. What do you mean they're not hers? The rest of the remains belong to other victims. - Jesus Christ. Why didn't you tell me? - Because we didn't know at that time, and headlines like this would have guaranteed a mass panic. I do hope you're not driving. Walking. BIIII What... So how many are we talking here? This is mass murder. There's a fucking lunatic out there. The public need to be alerted. Surely with your tech... Cheers, Hector. I mean, surely with your technology you can... - you can find out... - Shh. Listen. The samples didn't provide us with any clues as to who the other persons were. There were no personal effects, nothing. What the forensic report did say is that some of the remains were immersed in water over a long period of time. This spot is called Clootie Well. It's a reputed sacrificial site belonging to druids. We've checked it out... found nothing. Okay, maybe I'll take a look. But why are you telling me this now? You have a way of finding out things. We don't want this out. Not yet. - Hmm? ' Okay, I'm going to need the facts as I go along, Bill. And I won't wait forever. I appreciate that. Look, as soon as we have something, it's yours. By the way, forensics also said that some of the flesh had been eaten and gnawed at. What by an animal? No. By a human. Are you kidding me? No. You might have to add cannibalism to your story. Enjoy. Oh fuck! Hey! You can't park here. There's a rank at the shopping center. Move there. Is there anybody in there? Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing? You better open up, mate! I know you're in there. Jesus Christ. No. God. Oh my God. Hey! What the fuck? Listen, mate, I've told you, you can't park... Oh my God. No. Please please. Please please please please please. Oh my God. Cheers, mate. Thanks. Shit. Wend. Wendy, come on. Wendy, come on. Look, we need to talk. Let's go have a coffee - at the hotel or something. - What do you want? I don't have time. When Charlotte disappeared, who reported it and when? I thought the police gave you all their information. Yeah, they did. It's just that I'm tying up some dates and times with some of my own notes. One of her student friends who left her at the taxi rank... Wait. She caught a taxi before she disappeared? Yeah. But the police contacted all the taxi companies, even the private ones. Nobody remembers seeing her or taking her home. She just vanished. Nobody knew or saw anything. I know. I even published her photo in the newspaper. Not one call. Nothing. Anyway, it's too late now. I just really miss her. We can try again. I wanna s... For fuck's sake! What? Ah, good afternoon to you too. Yeah, your timing's shit. Oh, so you don't want to know the latest then? - Ah. So what's up? - Well, we've just received a call from a Jamie McPherson. It seems his girlfriend has gone missing. We're questioning him right now. He left her outside a club a few nights ago, thought she'd get a taxi home, - hasn't been seen since. - A taxi? Listen, Bill, we need to meet up. I need to run something by you. - Is it all right if I come down? - Sure. I'll see what I can find out and I'll let you know. Get off him! Jesus said, "Unless you eat the flesh of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you." Mmm. Ahh. The gospel is deliberate in giving us these words and inviting us to feed upon them. Ah, tasty! No more tickets. Get more gravy! Patience, Mother. Patience. What took you so long? If you've been touching that girl, you'll know what I'll do. Yeah. Ah! Right! Take this to your mother. And get your brother to fillet this rat. I'll be upstairs preparing the motor. Ah. What now? You idiots. Find her! No. She's pretty. Do you think, uh... he had anything to do with it? I don't know. Can I trust a dealer? But the doorman did say that he saw her on her own before he left. I'll get it ready for print, you just say the word. So what was it you wanted to talk to me about? Well, two things. First, this is the site of an unsolved case where the bodies of missing people were discovered in 1970. And this is where Charlotte's remains were found. They're in the same vicinity. So where did you get the photo? The library. And the murders were a similar act... mutilation. I'll get someone from records onto this... and I'll check the details of the case. Simple detection, Bill, all from the library. That would be over 40 years ago. It means the killer would be getting on a bit. Don't you think? Well, I'm going out there tomorrow anyway. I'll let you know how I get on. I'd be interested. Any leads are welcome. So what's the other thing? Everyone's been talking about taxis before the girls go missing. Isn't it strange that the last time the girls are seen is before they catch a taxi? If you're talking about Charlotte McIntyre, we carried out extensive enquiries for over a week. Nobody saw anything. We did bring in a couple of convicted drivers and had them thoroughly checked, but they had proven alibis. What about this new girl Rebecca and the taxi she caught? No. I said the boyfriend thought she caught a taxi. She's not missing yet. Sweet. No. Tidy. Very very tidy- You little dancer. Hail the winds of vengeance. Slay what may be in our way. The guilty will always be condemned. Amen. Hey. I was just thinking about you. Why? Do you need more information? No. Come on, Wend. I really miss you. Anyway, I think Charlotte was being stalked. Stalked? W-what do you mean? A student friend of Charlotte's sent me some photographs from the graduation party. Two of the photos with Charlotte in them have got the same car in the background. They were taken at different locations. It's a taxi... a black cab. Can you see the registration number or a face behind the wheel? No, you can't see the number plate- it's blocked by a person and then another car. It looks like the windows have been blacked out. Do you think it's possible that the killer is a taxi driver? I don't know, Wendy, but that sounds suspicious. Look, I want to come round and see them but... look, I'm in town at the moment but I want to come and see you anyway. No, you can't. I've got to go to work and I'm already late. But you can take me for dinner tomorrow. I'll bring them along then. I'll call you. Look... great. That so... that sounds great. Look, I'll see you then. I love you. I love you too. Yes! Come on, Hamish. Hi, Wend. Hello? Mr. MacDonald. Hello? You can see what I mean, can't you? The smell's obnoxious and it's specially strong at night for some reason. It is strong. And there's a higher than normal reading. Possibly a blockage somewhere. Do you know this has been happening for years and nothing's been done about it? But it's gone too far this time. I mean my husband's even willing to sell this place at a loss because of it. I'm quite surprised, because a new pumping station was built not far from here a couple of years back. Your line used to run through the old mine shaft... so let me check that out first and I'll get back to you, Mrs. Cameron. Okay. Oh Jesus! God, what a day. Where are ye? Right. North, south or east... and west? East it is. Standing in the middle of... Clootie Well. Small stone steps... lead, uh, into the forest to the right of the crime scene. An old wreath marks the spot where they found her. This is a person, or persons, who commit savage acts and does so repeatedly. Predatory killers often do far more than commit murder. Some have sexual desires, humiliation. They create gruesome rituals as much for pleasure as for any other reason. This killer is not merely deranged, but evil. Evil in that they're habitual, deliberate, savage, defying any psychological explanation or moral judgment. They know what they're doing. Hamish. Help me. - Bill. - Hamish? You sound startled. - You okay? - Yeah. Yeah. I'm at the site where Charlotte's remains were found. It's fairly rugged here. There's nothing much to report. Well, it's official. You can go ahead and print your story now. Okay, will do. I'm heading to the next site now. Look, can we meet up later? I'll have more pictures to show you. I think my theory on taxis has some substance. - I'll call you. - I look forward to it. The location has, uh, dramatically changed. The forest has... overgrown everywhere. I'm going to go look for a high point. What's that smell? Oh shit. Hello? Hello! Hello? Help! Help! Help! Please! Help me! Someone help me, please! No no no! No! No! No! No! No! What in the name of God is this, huh? Where did you find him? Have you checked the tunnel? Did he come with anyone else? Did you search him? A waterboard man. Get him in the chair! Okay, get his car, take it round the back, make sure no one sees you. We'll dump it later. Clean up the mess! Leave no trace! Nothing! You're a sweet little waterboard man. Yum. He's a sweet waterboard man. We're gonna have some fun with him later. Tie him up. I've got a job to finish. Fuck. Fuck. Oh God. Wendy. Hello? I need your help. Our intrepid journalist is awake, huh? You fucking maniac. Hey, you save your profanities and characterizations for your news article, yeah? Oh yeah. I read your column with the greatest of interest. Yeah. I know who you are. You've made me, so to speak, an icon. Who the hell are you? And what do you want with us? Well, the answer to that, you have to go back over 500 years and follow my bloodline. To the time when food was scarce, life was cheap and only the ferocious survived. Well, then my forefathers, they found succor in the good book. The Lord will provide, yes. "Any man who eats of this bread shall have everlasting life, and the bread that I give shall be my flesh for the life of the world." "And the unbelievers, they said, 'Why would Jesus give us his flesh to eat?' And Jesus said, 'Amen. Amen. But I say unto you, eat the flesh of the son of man and drink of his blood and ye shall have everlasting life." Jesus! Fuck. Fuck. "'My flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed." You're fucking crazy. Sweet! "This is from heaven." You bloodthirsty bastard! Thirsty? No. Hungry? Yes... Which brings us to the second part of your question. You're just food. You are a gift from God, which is who we are. And what godly end did you plan for Charlotte, huh? Charlotte? Oh yes, Wendy's sister, huh? Wendy? Wha...? You didn't know I knew Wendy, did you? Yeah, but first, to answer your question, we thought Charlotte was really sweet, really cute and we also found her blood tasty as well. So what I did was I made a really nice stew out of her ears, out of her nose, out of the flesh of her face and her belly. Oh, threw them in some oil, some cloves of garlic and chili. She was... mwah! ...utterly delicious. You see, anyone can eat human flesh, you just have to make sure you wash it and garnish it well to avoid disease. Now I particularly like the thighs and the calves. They're my favorites- the muscles. I prefer the taste of women to men and I never eat hands or feet or testicles. Ugh. I mean, there was a time when food was scarce... - ...and I nearly had to try it. - Shut up, you maniac! Shut up! Ah. Mother's hungry. Judd! What the fuck? You're all deranged. Take this to Mother. Fu... Oh, I forgot to ask... are you hungry? Bad men do what good men dream. Im going to show you a little delicacy- the sweetest part of the human body that I make the most delicious and nutritional soup from. It is utterly utterly delicious. It is the human head. No! Fuck. No. Wendy. Wendy! Bastard! Fuck! No! I take it you don't want soup then? No! The music. Mother of God, this is going to get ugly. Come on. Oh fuck. What the... I'm sorry. What are you looking at? Get the power on! Hamish. It's Bill. Give me the gun. Give it to me. Put it down, mate. It's okay. Give it to me. Come on, Hamish. That's it. What are you doing here, Bill? They're down here. Th-they're down there. It's okay. It's okay. I know. How did you find me? Hamish, you best... you... you'd better sit down, eh? They killed them. They killed them all. Bill? Sawney! It's me. I'm here. You're in on this? From the beginning, Hamish. You set Wendy and Charlotte up. - You murdered them! - Sit down! Now. Why them? What is it they say? "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer." No, that's not why. I'll tell you why. Because I hate your fucking guts. That's why. The problems you've caused me and my family are tenfold. But you just couldn't stop meddling and coming up with new ideas. Hmm? This is not looking good, brother! Brother? What, that fucking lunatic? It's okay. It's okay. Leave it. My brother dislikes swearing. Who gives a shit? You're all fucking crazy! - She's loose. - Shit! Where is she? - I don't know. - Where's Judd? He was feeding her! Torch this place and get out of here now! - Jake! - You're all a bunch of sick cunts! I think it's time our friend joined the food chain. No! No! Bastard! Hamish! Hamish, please... let's talk. Come on, Hamish! Let's go for a drink. We can talk about this, talk about Wendy. She was the... sweetest of the two sisters. What else can you say about Wendy, Hamish? Well... she had great head. Does that hurt, Hamish? Do you know how much Wendy hurt? Come on, Hamish. What, no fight left? Come on!
