Look I really am sorry. - We were attacked, ok? My sister was kidnapped -have him walk the path tomorrow. No! Let him cross alone. Ah, so you're up. - Who are you? - Your fairy godmother. So you survived the path of blood. You'll probably be seeking revenge now. I've got to find my sister. Sister? SHE would never harm a woman. It wasn't SHE, they were men. Not even nukes. - Their leader was all dressed in black - you must mean the Norks, well they're awful too But if they've got your sister, well you might as well forget about her Why? Because you'll never reach Nork valley. Even if you do, you'll never come out alive. You'll encounter there the ultimate horror. - Do you know the way to Nork valley - No actually, I'm afraid I don't I know some medicine, a little physics, a smattering of philosophy. Nothing useful. - Who would know the way? - Ah. I don't. Uh... SHE, SHE the goddess, only she knows the way. - Guess I'll just sit here... - Tom! I thought you were dead! Hardly. Come on, keys are on the table cut me loose! You look kind of cute like that You cut the jokes, cut me loose, come on. Let's go. Hey! What do you think you're doing? All right. Nice shot! You ok? - I wish I could come with you. - No you don't. - If I cross, walk the path. -No way you'll cross! You are pure goddess, in body and soul. You may enter. You have passed through the cycle again goddess. But the prophecy still stands. A man will come to claim your heart For him you will break your vows. Through him you will be destroyed. You are whole again. Shandra! Guards!! - Which way? -Which way? - Beats me. - I said which way!? Look! I gotta know which way to go! Come on. You are beautiful. What's wrong? Too skinny. I like them with more meat on them. T-t-tom! - Long time no see goddess. - Cut me loose Kram. Why? What did you ever do for us? Take them down. Her too. - What's the big idea Kram? - now you'll certainly know what it's like living in a tomb my goddess Turn me loose Kram I was counting on your help. That wasn't very smart of you was it goddess? "Never trust a mutant". That's your motto isn't it? - Look, we're neighbors. - Sure, sure. When the sand runs out of here... I'll send you back to your castle. You two will die a horribly painful death in their hands, they are experts on pain. Cute, real cute. I'll kill you Kram! This is no good. What are you doing? Oh, Shit! Are you ok? - I brought you some clothes. - Good. Uh, no hard feelings eh? - Shut up nuke! - Be careful of my arm, they tend to fall off What do you want me to do with him? Turn him loose. Get in there! I told you to watch the arm. Bring me those two men. - Do you wanna kill them here? Don't you want a public execution? - Just get them. Nork valley is that way, but you'll never make it there alive. - Untie them. - What? Now! Let's get out of here! - Why? - I'm curious, you go back with the guard. - No way, I'm coming with you. - Suit yourself. Uh! Dammit! What's the hurry? Had I the heavens' embroidered cloth. Enwrought with golden and silver light The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half-light, I would spread the cloths under your feet: But I, being poor, have only my dreams; I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams. What's this place, a funny farm? Friends. We have some visitors. Welcome strangers. This is a delightful surprise. We need some directions. Oh, come come, you can't be leaving us already, can you? How do we get to Nork valley? We insist you stay at least one night with us. - We serve wonderful food, Don't we? - We sure do. This is a wonderful garb, what is it made of? - Ok, we'll spend the night. - Wonderful! Of course you'll have to get changed for dinner we do like to dress formally after dark. Whoa! - This place is wonderful. - Civilized. This is what the world used to be like, before the isolation. My parents told me all about it in great detail before they died. Ah...the old world. This one is fine with me, this place is great. Help yourself. What is this? - Do you like to dance? - No I don't think so. It's a wonderful old world custom, dance, you should try it. More meat! No! What's wrong? Your friend seems slightly over-enthusiastic. My friend's an asshole. Get it off! - Are you hurt? - I'm ok. What was that? - Do you mind keeping some distance? - You want me to sit on the horse's ass? - You can walk for all I care. - What is this place? - I don't know. I never travelled this far - Must be terribly uncomfortable. - Are you scared? - Not with you around to protect me. Sieze them! Let's get out of here! Enough! There will be no violence in the hall of Godan, the one and only man-god. Bow! - Bow to Godan! - Forget it, I bow to no one. - This is sacriliege girl, cross the flesh - I don't care, I will not bow. - Kill them! - Stop! Who are you? I am SHE, goddess of the Yurick. You are nothing, goddess of nothing. How dare you! Let me down! You! Put me down! Put me down! Let me go! Let me go! Will you cut it out? Let me go! Put me down, let me down now! - Are you her followers? - Oh no. No no. We hardly even know her. I mean we just got picked up. They gave us a ride Do you believe in the one God? The only God Godan? Yeah, sure. Listen we're pilgrims, right? We came from afar to pay homage to the great god Godan. Right? Right? - Right? - Yeah, sure. Good, put them up for the night and send them away tomorrow with my gospel. Those two... I'd like to introduce you to pain. Nothing teaches you about mortal limitations like pain Blessed be the man who knows his element, blessed be the man who knows his master - You stink, traitors! - Yeah, sure, have fun. - No! Don't burn her, burn me instead! - Don't worry child, your turn will come. Scream mortal, you're weak. Feel the pain. Eva. She is a unique mortal. Bring her to my chambers. I wish to study her spirit - I'm not sure that's a very good idea. - Are you questioning me? - No. - Are you doubting me? -No. - Then do it now. Untie her. Eat. Excuse me. Can I have that apple? Hey, what...? Imposters! - Hey, where's SHE? - They took her to Godan's chambers. You ok? You look taller, or longer or something. - Where's Godan's room? - No idea. I'll take you to Godan's. I will. - Godan asked for the second girl as well. - I wasn't told about it. Well I was! Open the door. - It's locked. - Step back. Don't take another step or I'll break her arm. I wouldn't do that. Guards! Guards! Eva you were right. They must be crossed immediately. - What about her? - She is still useful. She will serve well as we teach her people a lesson in monotheism. Your people will be mine goddess. I get your point. - Get rid of these three. - What about her? I said three. I...am your God! - We believed in you, but you betrayed us! - I...am Godan. - Man...God. - You're a man! And you're dying! I have mastered your God, accept me! Now! Suckers! Don't you think we've gone far enough? All they have to do is go through the forest. No one ever walked out of this forest alive. - Then why are we here? - Because that's the way it has to be. - You're not making any sense. - Shanda, this has nothing to do with sense. You need this? Not from you I don't! - What's wrong? - I don't know. But something is. You go on ahead. Yeah, I know what you mean. Hey, I... Tom! I got it! I got it! Tom!...Tom! - Who are you? Who is your God? - Are you male or female? - That we can find out in a second. - Ease up. Run! Run! Come on! Oh. Thank you my dear Rudolph. Oh he will make a splendid addition to our collection. Put him over there. You may go to sleep now Rudolph. Our friends aren't going anywhere. Where's Tom? What have you done with Tom? Unless one of the three girls' name is Tom, we have no Tom here. You'll survive. What do you want with us fat man? You are a superior specimen. I might try some breeding experiments with you. I'm glad you're reasonable. - If you let me go, I'll reward you. - There's nothing I really need darling girl There is something you could use Rabel. You know my name. I'm flattered. What is it that I need? - The Yurick crystal. - You can't! You're not allowed... - What do you say? - The Yurick crystal. Mmm, only two of it's kind. One of them is owned by Aratten, god of the Norks. And the other belongs to... Me! - I can send her to get it. - It's an interesting proposal. Very well! Rudolph! Don't get any funny ideas or your goddess will cross immediately. What are you doing? He's waking up! It's going up in flames! Let me out! Let me out! Help! How do we get out of here? How do we get out? Let me open it. Oh you think this is bad, eh? You think this is bad? You should have seen the other race relation. And it's a Xenon push into the first pennant drive of the season On the opening lineup, it's Xenon on first, on second Xenon and of course on third Xenon And let's not forget last year's season favorite.

Hostile elements reported on north side." "No females sighted. You may engage and destruct." I'll kill the bastards for this. Sit down! This is the life of the Norks. Food! Women! and War! Nothing better on the face of this Earth. Now you have an opportunity to be a Nork. Out of the twelve of you only two will be allowed to join our ranks. Only the two strongest, smartest, toughest, deadliest sons of bitches will make it. The rest of you will cross! You came here of your own free will. To our monthly challenge. This is your last chance to withdraw. I will give you ten seconds to make a decision. One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... Seven... Eight... Nine... - I wish to withdraw. - Go ahead. Anybody else? Alright. Enjoy yourselves. We are ready! It's her! Sit down. Go! Tom! - I thought you were dead. - Hardly! Tom! You have violated the Nork ritual, goddess of the Yurick. - You will now pay dearly for your transgression. - How? At dawn my warriors will attack your sector. By sunset your people will be my slaves. - The Yurick will be no more. - Never! Run, goddess. I spare your life but your people are doomed. - It is no use. The sun is up, I cannot warn my people in time. - What do you want to do? I'm going to fight it out here. You climb down to the river they'll never follow you there. - Cross for sure. - I have no choice. Come on let's get going. - That's not very smart. - Maybe You go on.
