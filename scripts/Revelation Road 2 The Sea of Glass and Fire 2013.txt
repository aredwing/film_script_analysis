No, after the faithful have been chosen, the earth will endure for a while longer. And in this final time, the souls left behind will suffer, they will see the earth tum to darkness; they will see the horsemen ride and the serpent rise. Men will tum against each other in fear and hate and all will be lost, unless... the choice is made to turn away from evil, the choice is made to forsake the darkness and look within where there ever burns an eternal flame and there ever ows a tranquil sea. In the nal days there will be little hope or joy, but there will be choice. You're gonna overcook that bird. I think the bird will be fine, thank you. Could you be a doll though and go and set the table for me? Sure. Sheriff, we've got a problem. Lightning strikes all over... Fires breaking out- Eddie Bunson's field's on fire... reports of earthquakes... power lines are down on Symmes Creek... Sheriff, you copy? Well, hello. Did you remember to go to the grocery store? I did not and I didn't remember to go to the pharmacy either. Hey sweetie. So it just slipped your mind? As a matter of fact, it did. Get out of there. Come one, we're about to eat dinner. It's been a big, big news day. What happened? Can I have a cup of coffee and relax a minute? Lynnette, honey, do you have any clean placements? Oh... Kathy? Hey Sis. So...? So, what? So you said it was a big news day. You didn't hear? There was a robbery at Frank's place. I heard people were killed. Really? How do you know that? Can't anyone keep their mouth shut? It's an ongoing investigation. Frank is fine, his granddaughter too. It was a biker gang. Abiker gang? Okay, shh, I'll start at the beginning. Okay, this fellow rolls into town, salesman, name of Josh MacManus. Normal guy, sort of guy you wouldn't think twice about. Hey hon. Hi sweetie, how are you? When are you coming home? I'll be home tomorrow I promise. Will you pray with me? Whoa. He stops by Frank's place to do some business. Ultra-high, molecular-weight polyethylene. it's enough to stop a high-caliber sniper round. Stop now, on. And bam, just like that these three suspects run in there armed to the teeth. No beginners either; these guys were killers. I'll waste you! Hands up! Fill this bag up with automatics and cash now! We're in, Boss. Three minutes, tops. No witnesses. Sorry partner, you heard the boss. So this guy Josh, out of nowhere, he swoops in, takes these guys apart. It's over in seconds. The craziest thing I have ever seen. Well, who is he? Well, that's the best part. We don't know. Who are you? He just sprang into existence bout 5 years ago. There's no record of him before that at all. The man is a ghost, probably CIA or military. You killed those three boys today and your hands aren't even shaking. Three of our own died today. What service were you in, son? Those that did it are still out there. And what did they do to you? But I now know who they are. There's some things about me that I- I haven't told you. Things that I... thought I could contain. I think you're running, vying to escape from the things you've done. Josh, you're not a bad person. You don't know me. Tonight we exact our vengeance. Jesus is a bridge. A bridge that can take you home. Blood for blood! But none of this leaves this table, right girls? Of course. No, Ennis, we say grace rst. Of course we do. Lord Jesus, we thank you for the food we're about to receive. We pray for Frank, Marion, and Beth. Protect them, watch over them in this hour of need. We pray for Josh MacManus, the man you sent to protect them. Be merciful for all those who have lost their way, Lord. We pray that everyone will see the light of your glory. Dad! What in the world? III III III III III III III III III III Find the tar... kill the target. No mercy. Your life is nothing. How is he responding? Kill the target. Better than expected. We have to stop. He won't last much longer. Give him the maximum dose. You're asking me to murder him. Find the target. I'm not asking you. No fear, no mercy, believe nothing. Josh! Jesus loves you. Nothing. No sign of him. What do we do now, Boss? So, what do we do now, Boss? That's a lot of work, old man. You sure you're tough enough for that? III III III I want it to be done proper, you know? In a church, with a preacher. We say the words in front of God and Jesus. That sounds right. What do we do now, Boss? We keep ridin. We ride until it's done. Anyone who can't keep up... Shoot 'em. You can't hold us here like prisoners! There's no food. What are we supposed to eat? Use the vending machine. There's no power and we don't have any money. Nobody leaves 'till get my money! All of you, get back to your room! Hey, where do you think you're going? Get back, nobody leaves! All of you, get back in. I said nobody leaves. Nobody leaves tiH get my money. Hey, get back. Don't! I'm leaving. H you wanna stop me, shoot me. You think I- you thinkl won't? Look, I don't know what happened last night, but I have a feeling the pomrefs not coming back on. You are a thief. You're all thieves! You need to stop worrying about money and start thinking about your family, people you love. You even know if they're okay? \m mming y ou.! III Get away from the car! III III Hold on. Come on, come on, come on. III Hold on. III Get down! Stay down! Let 'em through! III Sheriff's department! Put your weapons down! Do it now! III Wm-o.! That boy belongs to me. He murdered three of mine and we ain't kill nobody. Tell me that's justice. I suggest you head north and stay there. I'm not gonna ask you again! Move! This ain't over. Move on! You're not gonna arrest him? Things have changed. You head into town, you'll see. Go. III I saw his face. It was | ove... joy. The light. I touched the light. It burned, no pain. It was love, so much love. It was endless. Are you feeling okay? I touched the light of God. That's where he is, my husband. I'm gonna get you to the Sheriff's station, okay? I never believed in my heart. Can I still be saved? Alright, I want a man posted on every road out of town. Wherever this boy jumps we're gonna be on his tail. What? You disagree with that? You got something to say? No disrespect Boss, but I was just thinking... It's too much. It's just one guy. Things are different now. It's like martial law or something. We need to go back to our own turf where it's easy pickens. We could live like kings. You need to let go. Live like kings. Sounds to me like you want your shot. You want this? You think you can do better? And just as you pledged to ride with me, I pledge to lead you down the right road. You're a part of our family now Gd we PIOIGCT OU! OWN. I'll ride with you to the end. Welcome home, brother. Nowtake your place in line. Cat, did you have something to say? This is the one I told you about. His name's John Dean- Name's John Dean Carver. I hear y'all looking for some good men. I wannajoin up with you. Yes, I am. We got no need for that here. We're doing only legitimate business now. You got that? Legitimate business. Do you vouch for this man? Well, then you can start by sweeping the floors. Any problem with that? Whatever you need, Boss. You think you can do better? May be I can. Well, then it's a challenge. Come and take it. III Maybe I will. I've had enough of you! Wm-o.! III III III III III It's over. You hear me? ifs over. Now get back in line. Wm-o.! III I said it was over. Now y'all need to decide right now. Are you outlaws or ain't ya? Cause I only ride with outlaws. We're with you, Boss. That boy is gonna pay. Then saddle up. Ain't we gonna bury him, Boss? Bury who? III III III III Josh! Mr. MacManus, good to see you. How are things at the motel? Yeah, there was a- there was a little trouble. Anyone hurt? I'm not really sure. Her husband, a few others- I don't know what happened. They just- they just vanished. We got 22 people missing I know of. They disappeared right like you said. Hey, lieutenant, go help her. I saw it with my own eyes. My sister, one minute she was there, the next minute there's a bright light, poof, she's gone. I told you, it was God. He took them up to heaven. You mean, like, from the Bible? Yeah, that's what some people have been saying, yeah. What do they call it? The Rapture? There's no way. I'm a Christian and I'm still here. I was with the pastor about an hour ago. I mean, that doesn't make any sense. Bill said you have to accept him in your heart and you have to repent of all your sins and ask Jesus for forgiveness before it's too late. Here, come on, let's go. Come on. You have people saying all kinds of crazy things: aliens, terrorists. We have to deal with what's real. We got no power, we got no communications, people are hurt, they're scared. And you haven't heard anything? Well, we heard some chatter on the CB radio. So far as we can tell, this, whatever it was, it happened everywhere. Cities are bad. Riots, lootin, a lot of bad stuff going on. Josh! It's best you stay in town with people you can trust, at least 'til things get back to normal. That's very kind of you, but I gotta go. My family needs me. Hold on a second. Where you're going, you're gonna need this. It's loaded. Thanks. I'm coming with you. No, absolutely not. You're staying here with your grand parents. Grandma and Grandpa are gone. What do you mean? The bikers came back looking for blood. I went out there last night, but I got there too late. House was- was all tore up. Frank and Marion? Well, she walked in last night with quite a tale to tell us. It seems Frank and his wife, they just disappeared like the others. I'm coming with you. L.A.'s on the way, besides, I'm supposed to. He told mel would. Who told you? Beth, you're a good kid, but there's no possible way I'm taking you with me. It's not gonna happen. III Here. Put that on. Ew, this is gross. It'll save your life. No, it won't. What's that? Just put it on. III III III III III What are we doing? What are they doing? Back in the car, slowly. What was that about? I don't know and I don't wanna know. III III Come to me, Cat. Hey Cat, come here for a second. Not you. Have a seat. This scrap heep again? You can't save it. Look honey, I know that we have never been close. I was way too young to have you. I admit that. I didn't know what! was doing. I probably still don't. I want to apologize for all of the mistakes that I've made. I just want you to know that... That I love you. You have nothing to apologize for. Maybe I'm tougher than you think. Is that what you're trying to prove? That you're tough? You're so smart and passionate. Now, don't get stuck here. Go do something with your life. I like it here. I belong here. You're never gonna get the love that you deserve here. Not from me, certainly not from your father: He lost interest in you the moment he saw that you weren't a boy. Who are you? What have you done with my mom? My eyes have been opened and I have a peace thatl have never had before. If you open up your heart to Jesus, Cat, he will show you the way. I'm finejust the way that I am. And just like your mother. Just remember, when you're in need, you can call to Jesus. He'll be there for you. Oh, now what? What's going on? Look, up ahead. What are they doing? Nothing good. What do we do? It'll take hours to go another way. I gotta get home. Josh! III Get your head down! Hold on! III What is wrong with these people? It's been, what, 12 hours since the power went out? They can all feel it. It's the end. Can't you feel it too? It's like all the beauty and love in the world is gone. God's grace is gone. I don't feel much since- Now, fear the target. Kill the target. You believe nothing. Kill the target. Fear is impossible. Find the target, kill the target. There's no fear; there is no mercy. III III III III Good ladies and gentlemen, once again, this is Gene Daughtry from the Power on Glory Broadcasting Newark. We are back on the air for now. Those of you just tuning in, Pastor Kelson, well... well he's been taken up to heaven, but before he went he recorded a special message. It's a message! think we all need to hear. We'll be repeating it for as long as we can keep the generators running. Stay safe and God have mercy on us all. This is Pastor Kelson. In the Gospel of Matthew our Lord says, No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.  No man can know the hour. The Lord will come for us in his own time. We're told to look towards that day in anticipation of laying down our earthy burdens, but we cannot know the hour. So worry not about the signs in the sky and instead sanctify yourself to living as he commands and letting the light of his strength shine through you, to your friends and to your neighbors. Teach your children his ways; don? waste a day, for no man can know the hour, but the hour will come. And in the blink of an eye those who are faithful will receive their reward. For the rest, there is still hope of salvation if you would only- A lot of cars, no people. What does that mean? Means ifs a trap. What are you doing? Well, trap or not, if we don't get gas here, it's the end of the line. Stay down. III III III III III Drop the gun, mister. III I know you don't believe, but Jesus does love you and he can forgive you if you wanna be forgiven. It's never too la re. On your knees, hands behind your back. Well, hey cuz, you remember me? This is for my truck. III III III III Hey, I can't thank you enough. The generator will keep the gas flowing for a few days. What about him? Oh, uh, don't worry about him. The deputies will be by later to deal with him. Well, thanks for the gas. Good man, Dale. What do you think? Upgrade? What is it with you and other people's property? Those people tried to kill us. What is it with you and this old hunk-o-junk? What's wrong with my car? I'm a good man. I'm a good man. I'm a good man. That was a very dangerous thing you did back there. You gotta be more careful. Don't do it again. I had things right where I wanted 'em. Right. I had to save you. What are you talking about? I'm the one protecting you, remember? That's not what I heard. Okay, obviously you wanna tell me something. I'll tell you my secret, but only if you tell me yours first. What secret? Alright, whatever, be that way. There's no fear. You believe nothing. Fear is impossible. Alright, I was in the service. I volunteered for special ops, where I received extreme training. So, what, you have like a robot brain or something? No. I don't... feel fear the same way that other people do. Fear makes a person hesitate in times of danger; it clouds the mind. They burned it out of me. Howd they do that? We have definitive proof that in certain rare cases, soldiers who are exposed to massive battle trauma do not become ineffective; instead the opposite effect occurs. Find the target. Kill the target. There is no fear, there is no mercy. Kill the target and anyone that stands in your way. III Your target is Mehrzad, son of an elder warlord and a symbol of hope for the resistance. III These unique soldiers emerge from their trauma completely fearless. Fear is impossible. You fear nothing. You believe nothing. Your life is nothing. Only the mission matters. My scientic team has isolated the emotional conditions and the chemical triggers that allow for this phenomenon to occur. Imagine, an army of soldiers without fear of pain, loss, or death. Completely loyal, free from any emotional or moral or spiritual attachments. I present our prototype. Achilles. Find the target. Kill the target. There is no fear. There is no mercy. Find the target. Kill the target. Find the target. Kill the target. How'd they do that? It was extreme. Look, what is this nonsense about you saving me? I met a man. Elizabeth, stand behind me. I'll protect you. Only he wasn't a man. That's impossible. Are you him? He talked to me and he told me what I needed to do. You have a very important pan in God's plan. What you need to do is to get back to your parents as soon as possible. They're not there. They're gone like all the others and my grandparents. How do you know? Because they followed Jesus. They all did, but I chose not to. They tried to warn me, tried to help me, but I didn't listen. You really believe that? Didn't you see what happened last night? That was like the express elevator to heaven. I don't know what I saw. I mean, I believe in God. I'm still here. What about that pastor? The deputy said that he was still here too. How do you explain that? I think that there's believing and then there's believing... in here. And that's only half of it. You still have to ask Jesus for forgiveness and accept him as your Savior. That's the only way to heaven. it says so right in the Bible. The Bible says a lot of things. God has a plan for you, Josh. He wants you to do something. The man in the desert told... I think you hit your head, hard. I'm the normal one here. Raise your hand if the government didn't do weird experiments on your brain. Yeah. I seen him. They passed this way about an hour ago. Headed down south. Rig ht decent folk. He was with somebody? Sure, teenage gin', you know, pretty. Alright then. You, uh... you gonna pay for this gas? Yeah, let me get you my credit card. What happened? We were on that security gig. What were you securing? It was legit, escorting a truck of TVs to Reno, that's it. It was the Skulls. They came out of nowhere. They jacked the truck. They shot D-block; he ain't gonna make it. And this one? This is the one we caught. Boss, this is no accident. They knew we'd be there. Well, then we got a rat in the house. Let's find out who. No, no. Get out. I'm not going anywhere. You made a promise to me and God that we were done with this. What about my promise to them? If I can't protect my own men, I'm nothing. I'm weak! And I refuse to be weak. Any man can kill. That's not strength. Only a few can forgive. We'll find another way. God wants us... God wants us to take the right path. We've been down that hole. Just remember where it ended. It won't be like that. I cannot lose you again. I need you by my side in this life and the next. Let him go. But Boss! I said let him go. III Get me out of here, man! This guy's crazy! He said he was gonna make steaks out of me. No witnesses. Come on, man. Wait, wait! Come on, that boy you're looking for, I can help you catch him, okay? I know these pans real good. There's a shortcut. Please. Keep talking. Thanks. Hey, nub-uh, those are mine. Okay. Hi, this is Rachel. I realty wanna hear from you, so leave a message. Rach, it's me. I just got cell service. I'm coming home soon. I love you. III Right down there, bout 2 miles down is the highway. H you hurry you'll get there just before he does, okay, just like I said. Let's head south, knock off a gun store, light security. Isn't that what you said? You're so eager to prove something? Well, you did. You proved how completely worthless you are to me. Now I got a job even you can do: I just need you to stand there and look pathetic. Why do you talk to me that way? Why do you hate me so much? Good. Listen man- stop talking and listen to me. I don't care what you heard; they are doing it tonight. Yes, tonight. Another shipment, cell phones, Woodrow Road. Yes, I'm sure. They're leaving in a few minutes; be ready. L gotta go-. III No! No, no, baby. Baby, baby, I can't see you. I'm right here. I can't see- What do I do, Boss? Baby? I'm here. Stay with me. I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here. Cat. Cat! I'm right here, Mom. Cat- Stay, don't go, don't go. Stay, stay, Stay- stay- - ' III You broke your promise! III III III III Because she's gone. You ruined everything. What is it? Another trap? I don't know. ifs a woman. It looks like she's hurt. Come to me, Catherine. Is that really you, Lord? Are you listening? You know what I am, the life that I've led. III But I don't wrant it anymore. Tell me what to do. Please help me. Hey ma'am, are you okay? It's you! Hey! They're gonna kill you, go! No! Beth, Beth! Go, go faster! Hands up. Don't move! Beth? Beth! Stay back! Who are you? What are you doing? Talk! I don't know! I don't know, okay? I don't know what I'm doing. Get out of the car. Please. I can't go back. He'll kill me. I'm supposed to trust you? Please, just drive. I need to get away. I can't be with him anymore. Josh. Josh, you have to help them. You have to help them all; it's what you're supposed to do. Beth? It's okay. This is what was supposed to happen. The vest. That bullet went through. A vest can't save you, Josh. Only God can save you. You heard his voice too, didn't you? What? I gotta get you to the hospital. Josh, you have to listen to me. You have to hear what he said. It's important. He told me-he told me that this would happen. He said, "Don't-don't be afraid. "Soon you'll be reunited with your family... And abide in my love forever. " But first I need you to find Josh, go with him, keep him safe. Your sacrifice will point him to me and allow him to be the hero I need him to be in these final days. III Beth? Beth! I'm no hero, Beth. I'm no you. III III What are you doing? He's gonna keep coming for me hurting anyone who gets in his way. He's not gonna stop unless I stop him. Don't. He's my father. Then choose. Are you with me? Are you with him? I'm with you. Then buckle up. III III Wm-o.! III III III Wm-o.! III III Wm-o.! III III N's! No! Don't hurt him. That chain, why do you- How do you- Do you believe in that? That was my mother's. She was murdered. You still wear that? Forget that! Come on! Are you a warrior or not? God has a plan for you, Josh. Jesus is a bridge, a bridge that can take you home. Jesus does love you and he can forgive you if you wanna be forgiven. It's never too la re. Joshua, come to me. Argh! No. Enough killing. You wore that to remind you of someone you love. Don't you talk about her! We finish this! We're not warriors or monsters or titans. We're just- we're just men. Your mother... Did she believe? In her heart. Don't you dare talk about her! Maybe she's not gone. Maybe she's up there, waiting for you. Maybe this is your chance to be forgiven. No! No forgiveness! I've waited a lifetime for a worthy challenge and you're not walking away from me. I am done fighting! It doesn't solve anything! It doesn't change anything! I just want- I just m/ant peace. No. I just want- I just m/ant peace. I'm afraid. It's not possible. It's not possible. It's not possible. Are you really there? No! Can you really forgive my sins? No! All of them? I think he can. Jesus, forgive me. There's no forgiveness. You fight me. You ght me! Stop it! ifs over! He beat you. Fight! The better man won. Accept it. Because you betrayed me! Jesus, forgive me. I am not your enemy; I'm your daughter. I don't hate you; I love you. I just wanted you to be proud of me. AH' of this death and misery, don't put it on any of us. It's all on you. Listen to him, she's up there waiting for you. She loves you and wants to be with you again, but you have to take the rst step. Let your anger go. Let it go. Argh! III III III III Are you ready? Will he be okay? Worry no longer for the world, child. Come with me. Where are we going? To the most glorious celebration this universe has ever known. Are my parents there? Your parents and your grandparents are there waiting for you. Do I have to die? A caterpillar isn't afraid to leave its cocoon to become a butterfly. Have no fear. Trust me. I'm ready, Lord. III III III III III You gonna be alright? For the first time ever I knowwhol am and where I'm going. What about him? No one's ever beaten him before. He'll find his way. God bless you, Josh. Thank you. III III III III III Rac h? Hon? Rac h? Nat? Rachel? III "if we confess our sins, "he is faithful and just "to forgive us all our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. " Take care of them, Lord. Take care of them. Tell them I'm coming, Lord. Tell them I'll see them again. III
