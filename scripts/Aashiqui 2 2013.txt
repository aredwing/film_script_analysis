I want to talk to you. - Sir, sorry.. Sit. - And, I made you do such stupid things. Pick up vegetables. - Be quiet for a minute. What's your name? Aarohi Keshav Shirke. Aarohi. You've a great voice. - No, I was just. Just listen. Yes. You sung my song better than me. I just realized my aws. The mistakes I made in my songs. I never felt any of my song like this. You're joking. No. I never joke when concerns singing. Rahul! Rahul! Are you mad? I found your car crashed, in the middle of the road. Whether you're dead or alive, you could've have.. What are you doing here? Let's go. Let's go from here. Rahul, let's go. - Don't go, Aarohi. Let's go. Let's leave. He's a drunkard. He was just trying to convince her.. Yes, let's go. Is 1 am. And, the police can raid any moment. But, he's such a big artist. If we leave.. - He won't know. Let's go. Deepak's looking all over for you. We've four more shows to do. If this continues. ...we'll have to return all the money. We will return the money, Vivek. What are you saying Rahul? Listen. I've to go back to Mumbai tomorrow. This singer, Aarohi.. - Who? Where's everyone? Forget it, let's go. Rahul, let's go. - Wait. Where's everyone? - They all left. I want that girl's address. Where does she stay? - Kolhapanaji! I'm going. - What? Give me the car keys. What are you doing? - Give it. What's going on? What are you doing? - Pay for the whiskey. Rahul! Rahul! How will I go home? 'You've a great voice.' 'You sung my song better than me.' 'I just realized my aws.' 'The mistakes I made in my songs.' 'I never felt any of my song like this.' Aarohi! Aarohi! Aarohi! Aarohi! Hi.-Oh, God! I want to talk to you, come down. Come down. I can't come. - Fine, I'm coming. No. no. no. - What? I'm coming. - Come down. What are you doing? What happened? Come on. What happened? Come here. What are you doing? I'm not allowed to meet anyone here. If the bar's management sees me.. ...he'll deduct a day's salary. - Sorry. I had to come. We couldn't complete our conversation at the bar.. What? So... You want to be a singer? - Who said that? You did. You were looking at Lata's picture. Just like a child looks at the moon. Wants to touch it. That look told me everything. Everyone looks at the moon. What good is that? - The beginning. Of every successful journey. You know, the best artists in the world. ...are the ones who have their own style. A style, that doesn't come from imitation. A style, that's born with them. And, you've got that. That special thing. I wonder what's that thing. ...that you heard, but the others can't. I tried really hard. But, no one gave me a chance. That's why I am here. Because, I want to make you successful. I want to make you the greatest singer of this millennium. Look I...not the kind of girl you think. I don't say these things to those girls. But, what to do? I think I am in love. I've gone crazy. Now, whether it's the art or the artist, that's yet to say. We'll know. But, only after you're sober. Listen. - What? You won't work in that bar. You'll leave that job. Because I say so. Do you believe me? Listen. What? Nothing. Just like that. Aarohi, are you okay? Yes. I am fine. 25,000! That's what I spent to bring you here. I suggest, you pay up and you can leave. What? Don't have it. Go. Shankar sir. It's the question of my life. Please let me go. I'll return your money once I get to Mumbai. No one's going to pay even 200 for this face. What do you think? This is no orphanage. Pay up and leave. You take up 50 percent. And, what are we left with? We've to buy food with our own money. It'll take me months to arrange that kind of money. Yeah! Exactly. That's why you steal money from the money-bag. What else do you expect me to do? You cut 100 rupees for minor mistakes. 200 for coming late. And my salary.. - Babu! What's wrong with her? She's constantly saying "I want to go". She was fine until yesterday. That singer RJ that came to bar yesterday. ...Is the one that provoked her. That he'll make her a singer. Give her a chance to sing in films. Since then" - I see. RJ. That singer. Just a minute. Look. His picture's in the papers. He had a fight with a man yesterday. He left before the show started. The organizer of the show was crying on camera. There are many other stories about him. But, no news about his work. He'll get you work. A man that's living off his hit songs of yesteryear.. ...can only pass time with you. Do you know why? Because you're worth it. Hello, sir...you.. I am here for this girl.. ...because she's going to a great singer. But, I can see her future, not you. One more thing. You run a bar. You live off singers. Learn to respect singers. Ones that sing at your bar. And the ones, whose songs help you run your bar. Get that. Vivek, throw the money on his face. He isn't worthy of any respect. Let's go, Aarohi. Okay. Goodbye. What's all this, Rahul? This is it. I pray to Allah that you're never head-broken. If that happens, don't hesitate. I'll get you work, and won't taunt you either. No, no, it's fine. I'll drop you. No. The place I stay, isn't your standards. I've noted my number, address.. ...and my manager's number in your diary. So, call me when you get a new sim. Okay? Don't forget. Thank you. - For what? For giving me new hope. Bye. - Bye. Listen. What? Nothing. Just like that. Father! Aarohi. You're back. - Yes. I was thinking about you. - Really? I even called you in my dreams. Your mother yelled at me. - Why? She called me crazy. - Father. But, you left for three months, didn't you? And in one month.. - I'll tell you everything. But where's mother? At the station. Today's Thursday. She's gone to buy the Maharashtra Rajya Lottery. She's been buying lottery tickets for the past two years. But she's never won anything more than 100 rupees. Enough! The daughter's back and the father can't stop yapping. Mother. Why didn't you say you're coming? I would've prepared something for you. We live off on fritters. But now that you're here, we'll make something nice. Give me 100 rupees.. ...I'll get something from the market. We'll make something good today. Mother, I.. ...didn't get paid. - Why? I met someone. He said he'll give me a chance to be a singer, in films. So I.. - You believed him. And quit your job. Mom. Mom. Everything will be okay. Trust. It's just a matter of few days. Once I star-t working. - So? I only have 300 rupees. 300 rupees.. Your father doesn't earn a penny. He.. keeps repairing everyone's radio and TV's for free. What are you saying? - Let me speak. Is this why I sent you to the best teachers? Taught you to speak good Hindi. So that you can become a great. I stitched clothes to pay for your fees. Finally you found a job, but you quit that as well. And.. I don't win.. the jackpot either. I thought if you get some money.. ...I will manage a few months. Now, I'll have to borrow from someone. No, mom. Let's see whether anyone will lend me money or not. Mom. Mom. Mom. Listen to me. - Aarohi. Let her go. Actually, it's not her fault. She's always seen poverty. And I never gave her anything either. But look. All our hopes are with you. We want good things for you. Father. First time someone's believed in me. First time I believed in someone. He came all the way from Goa, only for me. And he's gone to talk to someone for me, father. Uncle, I'm not joking. - Deadlines, boys. There's a girl Thank God! Get married, straighten up! No, no, no, it's not that. No. - No. This girl's a very, very, very, very good singer. I would've believed you if you had said "very" once. Please cancel my appointment for tomorrow. She was singing in a bar. Bar.. you mean where you were obviously.. Yes.. But, what a voice. I had an entire bottle, but I couldn't get drunk. Can you imagine? 15 minutes. Basically, I want you to give her a chance to sing in films. Or, make an album. She's superb, uncle. I can write that in blood. Do you have any blood left? Where is she? She stays here in Mumbai. She's from a poor family.. ...and performs out of the city to make a living. In these small bars. But I am not going to let that happen again. I really want to help her, uncle. She's a superstar. Superstar? - Yeah! A star, is someone whose songs, and voice.. ...makes you want to.. Whistle. Whistle. Just like people used to whistle at your performance. You were the star. You. She's better than me. She's amazing. I'm telling you, she's amazing. Call her. I'll first hear her and then decide. You're serious? - Yes. Yes. Thank you, uncle. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Out. Get out. Thank you. Listen to him. He's a good man. Excuse me, give me a simcard. - Take this. You are leaving Deepak's show? You will forget to sing. Be careful. Careful, please. Careful. Don't you dare tell anyone about this! If any journalist or media-person asks you about him. "Then say, he's gone to London for a show. In the meanwhile, nobody comes in, nobody talks to him. You get that. Hello. - Hello. Can I talk to Mr. Rahul? My name's Aarohi. He asked me to call me. I'm a singer, we met in Goa and he said.. - Rahul isn't here. He's gone to London, for his shows. And he'll return after 20-25 days. - 20-25 days? Yes, but just listen to me.. Hello! Hello! "It's your fault, my heart!" "It's your fault, my heart!" "Why did you trust him?" "All the promises were fake." "The one you followed here." "Beloved's nowhere." "Beloved's nowhere." "Beloved's nowhere." "Now, stop seeing those dreams." "Now, shatter those dreams yourself." "Beloved's nowhere." We don't have evidence. "Whether Deepak's involved or not. But I swear Rahul. I will find out whoever he is and.. Did Aarohi call? Not yet. Is your phone on? 24/7. Tell this girl that it's a wrong number. Hello. - Hello. Hello, is Rahul back. I am sorry, this is a wrong number. What? Hello. Hello. "There's punishment for every mistake." "if you're destined for sadness." "There's always a reason." "All my pain has conjured in my tears." "My tears don't stop trickling down." "Beloved's nowhere." "Beloved's nowhere." "Beloved's nowhere." "Beloved's nowhere." Okay. Give the money. See you. Goodbye. This fracture showed me the importance of my legs. Take care. Great. Good news. It's time to celebrate. I'll have a drink with you as well. Where to? - To look for Aarohi. Come on. Excuse me, is this Rahul's house? Yes, this is his home. But, sir's out of town. I don't know when he's coming back. Vivek sir said he'll be coming back after 20-25 days. It's been two months now. He hasn't returned. What can I do if he hasn't? I'll let you know once he comes back. Please leave. Please give this top Rahul sir when he returns. Tell him Aarohi was here. I tried calling him many times. I'll give it to him once he returns. Please go now. Coming! What happened? Sister-in-law, Salim. Aarohi. What's wrong? Salim. What's wrong? Who is it? What's wrong, Aarohi? I want a job. Any place. Good, bad or cheap. Just get me work. I need money, Salim. Come in. Sir. A girl gave this. When did she come? Yesterday evening. She said she called you two-three times. Maybe she spoke to Vivek sir. She looked decent, so I told you. Thank you. - Welcome sir. What the hell is wrong with you? Don't ask why I did that? You know. I told that girl never to sing in a bar again. I told her she'll be a successful singer. I told her she will be a star. I went to her hotel, Vivek. She didn't come to me. And what did you do? You humiliated her. You hid her calls from me. You lied to her. You treated her like an enemy. - Yes, because I'm your friend. I've been with you for years. You could've shown some respect for me. And for any darn girl.. - She's no ordinary girl! This is why I did it. So that you stay away from her. I didn't want this to happen, man! First alcohol, then drugs. And now.. - Whatever I do with my life is my problem, Vivek. No! This isn't your personal problem. I've been with you for 10 years. I looked after you, your career. I saw your success, your downfall. But, I can't see you handing over your success. "Which you need the most now, to some girl. I can't see you doing this for someone else instead. I feel sad. It hurts me. To know that you've stopped recognizing your talent. You've forgotten your own voice. One that's unmatched. Why? Why don't you see yourself? Why don't you hear yourself? You call me your enemy. Just. look at yourself. You're right. But the truth is, I don't want anything. Fame, for-tune, success, money, respect. It should all go to the one that deserves it. Give the bread to the one that's hungry for it. And I've seen that in that girl. And I no longer have that. And I've admitted this truth. You should too. Your friend can't pay you your salary anymore. RJ. - You're a free man, Vivek. You can go anywhere you want. Hello. Can I talk to Aarohi, please? She's performing? - Where? Hotel Nightingale. "What seemed like reality, turned out to be an illusion." "A saga, that was bound for a twist, has ended." "I forgot, so did she." "How do I tell everyone about this?" "I've slowly compromised myself." "I've slowly controlled myself." "Beloved's nowhere." "Beloved's nowhere." "Beloved's nowhere." "Beloved's nowhere." "It's your fault, my heart!" "It's your fault, my heart!" "Why did you trust him?" Aarohi! Aarohi! Please let me explain. Look. I work here. Don't create a scene. I got this job with great difficulty. Damn the job, I want to speak to you. Why should I? I've been waiting for two months. First time I hurt my parents and trusted someone. I star-ted dreaming. Everything seemed true. What now? Go ahead. You can vent all your anger. I am your culprit. But, I am not. I waited for you. Get in. Come on. - What are you doing? Get in. - What are you doing? What are you doing? - Come on. I want to tell you a story. I don't want to hear your story. Let's go. If all that happened with you.. "Then, why didn't they show it on TV? Aarohi, the TV.. Please forget it. I want to keep my promise. In fact I brought Sehgal uncle along. He's called you at his office. But, I cannot quit this job. I cannot take a risk again. Then don't. You can keep the job until you're satisfied. But, you've believed me so far, then why not another day. Be ready at 11 am tomorrow. Please. Please! You sing well, dear. You're talented. And you understand tunes. But, for playback singing and albums.. ...you'll need some grooming. Just a little. Because singing in recording studios with new songs.. ...can get a little overwhelming. Okay? Fine.. we'll star-t your vocal training from next week. Yes, I'll do that. I'll train her. - Fantastic! What else do you want? So many awards, records. They're all yours. They're mine, or not. I don't know. What? Nothing. Don't worry. Someday you'll come with your award. You'll have more awards than me. I promise. What? Nothing. Just like that. I can't do it. Okay, listen. I will show you. It's in B flat. "Just tell me, whether I want it or not." "Show me the way to your heart whether I want it or not." You sing so well. It's your training not me. Let's star-t singing. "Just tell me, whether I want it or not." "Show me the way to your heart whether I want it or not." "Let me tell you, that I don't have faith in my love." "Still, the hear-t thought.." "..now that we're here, why not ask." "Just tell me, whether I want it or not." "Show me the way to your heart whether I want it or not." "I never had such desires before." "I never tried this hard to meet anyone." "Solve my confusion, whether I want it or not." "Express it through your eyes, whether I want it or not." Aarohi! Aarohi! Aarohi! Ladies and Gentlemen. The time has come, for me to introduce you all.. ...to the nightingale of India, and our country's. ...latest singing sensation. The beautiful, the talented, the wonderful! Aarohi Keshav Shirke! Yes, dad. Rahul. How are you, son? Everything fine? - Everything fine, dad. In fact, I'm really happy. After a long time. You're in love, huh! "Just tell me.. How did you know? I'm your father. Come. When the son's in love, the father knows. "Show me the way to your heart whether I want it or not." What happened? Sir, she needs five more minutes. It's been half an hour, Rahul. Is there a problem? - No, sir. There's no problem. Aarohi. Come out. Let's go. I cannot sing. Aarohi, we all get nervous. I was too. I ran away from the studio. It's okay. No. The bar was a different story. Making mistakes were okay. But, here.. amongst these big people.. You're not alone. I am with you. Please, come out. I cannot sing. Aarohi, I love you. I love you. I've waited too long for this day. More than you. Come out for me. Please. "I've small dreams." "Dreams have songs." "Songs have life." "Love and affection." "I don't dream any longer." "That's without you." "I'm finally saying, what I didn't so far." "The hear-t trusts you, more than me." "I weave dreams about us, in my empty moments." "You're in love with me." "I'll never ask you, whether I want to or not." "I want to live in your dreams, because I want to." - Fantastic. Really nice. Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome to the Indian Music Awards. Finally! - Uncle. We're waiting for you. Where's Rahul? When you can't find Rahul anywhere.. ...you must always check the bar. But, it's such a big day of my life, he should be with me. I've been nominated. I understand. Mom and dad are here. I'll just. Come. Please come. Come on, he'll be here. Come on. Please. Aarohi! Aarohi! Come here. Looking for me? You scared me. Where were you? - Forget that. How do you feel? It's useless. Wonder where you keep disappearing to? I was at the bar. If you drink so much, how will you recognize me in the crowd? I will. Amongst, thousands, million, billions. I can forget myself, but not you. When did you fall so deeply in love with me? Hi, ma'am! I'm from CNTV Live. Do you mind if I take a small interview? Please. Just for five minutes. No, right now I.. - Just a second. Never do that. Okay. Never do that. Go. Time to touch the moon. Go get them. Ladies and Gentlemen. Moving on the next award. Nidhi Chaudhary for "Aa jara" Listen. - Yes, sir. Did you get the bottle from home? - No, sir. Then, why are you being a miser? Pour some more. Sorry, sir. And award goes to.. Aarohi Keshav Shirke. She won! Thank you. The girl sings well. She's very good. I heard she was offered to sing in films too. But she refused. She'll say yes. Everyone wants to be a star. Of course, she will be. But, not a star, a maid. What's that singer's name? That star. Rahul. She'll be his maid. And later, his nurse. Come on. He loves her. He's made her. She made it this far because of him. That's what I am trying to tell you. The higher she climbs the ladder of success. "The lower she'll fall because of Rahul. She belongs to a poor family, after all. That's why RJ's taken her in. So that he can make her serve him. Keep her awake all night, for his entertainment. To vent out the anger of his failure. And as days will go by, he will star-t hitting her. He'll beat her every day, humiliate her. And once he falls sick.. ...she'll be cleaning his pukes. Remember this. Often, those who light the lamp.. ...are the ones that douse it later. There have been many such stories in the industry. Another glass of whiskey. Rahul! Rahul! Rahul! Rahul. What are you doing? Get down. Finally, you touched the moon. You were looking very beautiful on the big screen with the award. Does this bottle look nice in my hands? It doesn't. But what to do. I just can't let go. Rahul. - No, no, wait. After I got my first break without any struggle. ...I got fame, for-tune, status. The world was at my feet. But, I didn't know what to do. I couldn't handle the fame.. . .OF HWY senses. That was the condition yesterday. ...It's still the same today. And it'll always stay that way. Rahul. What are you doing? What are you doing? Why are you doing this? We'll have to end this relation here. Now. Nothings lost yet. We aren't so close. We can live without each other. You're successful now, Aarohi. You've everything. Go, live your life. My habits have scared me. I don't know my future. What I might turn into. How I may treat you. It doesn't take long for one to turn into the devil. So, why should I hold you back? I can't do this. Then.. then" Leave this habit. Leave it. It's no good. I'll help you. I'll help you leave it. Just give me a chance. - I can never leave it. It's like a wife, that won't ever leave me alone. So, listen to me. You'll be happier without me. That means, you can live with this habit, but not me. Rahul. Love is not a joke. - But my life is. But, you always had this habit. If you were so scared, why did you come so close? You should've stayed away. - Exactly. Until now, I was my own enemy! And before I become a threat to you, just go away! Fine. L am going.

If I stay busy, who will look after him? He's going nowhere. You'll be at loss, because you don't know what you have here. You can lose all this in a moment. I tried explaining it to him. I beg you. Don't test me. I'm tying you down, right? Don't do this, Aarohi. Don't miss your schedules. I'll stay here, with you. Otherwise you will be alone. You will do whatever you wish. I cannot take this risk. I won't break your trust this time. - But, Rahul.. And you won't waste your life for me. But, Rahul I.. - Aarohi, your failure. ...will be the biggest defeat of my life.

You're doing well. - Yeah. Rahul! Sorry. Beer? No, thanks. - Sure? Yeah. Quit! Pass me a diet coke. Diet coke, huh! Cheers. Cheers. Mr. Rahul. Kunal Basu, I'm a journalist. Okay? I want an interview. Exclusive interview. About your personal life, etcetera, etcetera. Sorry, but I'm no longer famous enough.. ...for people to read about my life. They know it all. Not about your love-life. I mean, the thing between you and Ms. Aarohi. Few people know about it. I don't want to talk about me and Aarohi. You don't understand. Aarohi's fans want to know when she's getting married. I told you this is my personal matter.. ...and I don't want to talk about it. Your personal life's public property as well. No, it's not. Thank you. Mr. Rahul. You don't know what people say about you two. That's nothing new. People also say that, Aarohi used to sing in beer bars. And you supported her just to have some fun. You used her. You made her your concubine and left her. Who do you think you are? - What are you doing? You dare hit a journalist. Who do you think you are? You ruined a girl's life. You sleep with that girl. You stay with her, but you can't admit it. I'll have you arrested. Wait. You rascal. 9870541084. Yes, that's my number. Save it. Okay. We're here for him. Him. Not possible. What a man. He was drunk. He created quite a scene. He beat-up a journalist. Then, he beat-up a taxi-driver. He smashed someone's car. That's not done. And what's the time now. You won't get bail now. I'll call Kamte. - Go ahead. Call him. The court will open at 11 am tomorrow. He'll be present in the court first. ...only then he can get bail. He has to stay here tonight. Brother. Can I have a minute? - Sit. L.. - I know.. You're Aarohi Shirke, right. Yes. Who's he? L-- We're friends. We had a fight. I threatened to leave him. That got him worried and.. Love story. Right? Please, you can keep this. What's this? - And let him go. - No. And let him go. - What's this? No. It won't happen again. I promise you, and.. "It's you." "It's you." We'll go far away. Where no one knows us. I'll finish the contracts that I signed, and leave. Without Rahul, I don't want anything. I wanted to be successful. "But not at this price. Not by losing him. You don't fall sick along with the patient. Dear. If your love was his cure.. "Then why didn't it work yet? He's dependent on his habits. His aws. He doesn't want to get anywhere. So, where will you take him? Not me. He'll take me, in his world. The place where he stays day and night. And he's happy- His habits will be mine. His flaws will be mine. He cannot leave them, but. I can take them up. If this poison is his first love, then I'll accept it too. I'll stagger along with him. Then, I might find him at some point. He might get fed up of his habits. He might come back and say "Aarohi, I am tired". Then I'll say "Come.. ...let's go home." And, he'll come back. We'll come back, uncle. You've gone crazy. You don't know what you're saying. When did you get up? You kept crying all night. My love's made you sad. I was crying, because I was missing you. I am right here. Just like that. Come closer. I came here to tell you. You can cry all you want. Your days of crying are over. I'll leave everything, Aarohi. I'll turn over a new leaf for you. Everything will be fine. You and me. You'll help me, won't you? Have I ever said no? - No. The day I saw you first, I realized.. ...why you came in my life. You've loved me a lot. Given me a lot of things. I gave you what was easy for me. You endured my difficulties, my betrayal. Divided love. And I couldn't give you your right place. But all that's going to change now. Right now. From this moment. Because Aarohi, I am going to join a gym. That's going to be my daily program. Gym in the morning, jogging in the evening. Proper diet. Aarohi. Really? Will you really.. - Yes. This time I am serious, Aarohi. Like I never was. L am going. Keep the food ready, and wait for me. Miss me. Rahul. I love you. Come on. I'll change all this. Aarohi. What? Nothing. Just like that. "Forget me. This is my final goodbye." "You've to live on.. without me. "This is your journey, your path." "You've to live on.. without me. "I pray you attain fame." "I pray you're blessed with all the grace." "You've to live on.. without me. "Forget me. This is my final goodbye." "You've to live on.. without me. "You're my shore, my support" "You're the tune in my heart my saga." "Be your own God." "I am like evening that's fading." "You're the new dawn." "You've to live on.. without me. "You've to live on.. without me. SIR EK BODY PANI ME SE NIKALA HAI. AUR AMBULANCE BULYA HAI BODY LEKE JAYEGE Aarohi dear listen. - Aarohi. Aarohi where are you going? Aarohi dear listen. - Aarohi. Aarohi don't Aarohi - where are you going. Coward! Coward! Coward! Coward! Coward! Coward! Coward! Coward! "It's you." "It's you." Where are you going? Anywhere? What do you mean? I mean far away. I'm leaving everything. But, that's not what Rahul wanted? Rahul who? I don't know any person by that name. Aarohi, decisions taken in a rage, always hum in the end. For the first time, my decision hasn't hum me. Good. Very good. Please go. He should fade away. Die inside you. He was worth that. I tried stopping him. But he didn't stop. He said.. "This is it". He sold your an, like your secretary. The little life that he had, was just for you. But my friend died, the day he hum you. The day he raised his hand on you. The day he saw you at the police station. He knew. Drinking was his weakness. He had become your weakness. The biggest obstruction in your path. And so, he gave his life. So that you can live. So that, you don't become another Jayekar. But you know what, he failed. My friend lost. You turned out to be another Rahul Jayekar. "The place where buds will blossom." "That's where you'll find me." "The place that'll remind you of my loyalty." "That's where you'll find me." "I'll come see you, I promise you." "I'll always be with you, I promise you." "You've to live on.. without me. Aarohi ma'am, I'm a big fan. Can I have your autograph, please? Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you so much. Wow! but Aarohi rahul Jayekar. Yeah rahul Jayekar that singer. "Because it's you.. it's you." "You're my life." "My relief, my pain." "You're my love." "You and I share a strange bond." "We can't stay away a moment." "I live only for you." "All my time is devoted to you." "I can't live a moment without you." "Each Dream's just for you." "Because it's you.. it's you." "You're my life." "My relief, my pain." "You're my love." "It's you." "It's you." "I lived only for you." "I've surrendered myself." "Your loyalty supported me." "It cured all my pain." "My destiny's tied with you." "You made me complete." "Because it's you.. it's you." "You're my life." "My relief, my pain." "You're my love."
