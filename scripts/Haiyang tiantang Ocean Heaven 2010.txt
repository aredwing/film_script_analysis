Especially to the parents of children with special needs, ... who have given themselves continuously to the care of their kids, ... this is a tribute to the depth of your love, the depth of your heart. Let's go, son. Go. Flowers. Flowers. Old Wang. Madam Chai. So you're back. I saw the light was on. Hurry, take them. Here are the past two days' papers. And the doll and oil are Dafu's birthday gifts from the neighborhood committee. Thanks. Should I just stand here? Sorry! Please come in. I thought you'd be gone a while longer. Why are you back so soon? I changed my mind. Close the door. Mosquitoes are getting in. Put it down. What a smell. So bad! - It's nothing. - Where are your glasses? What's wrong with you? You've got such a beautiful seashell. Where have you been? Dafu. Hi, Auntie Chai. You don't even want me to touch it! Naughty boy. Since you're back, I won't keep your keys any longer. Check and see if anything's missing. You're kidding. Look at you. You told me to clean the house every 7 days. I would've cleaned it for you if I knew you'd come back early. Dafu. Where have you been with your dad? To the sea. For what? Both you and your dad stink. Dafu is hungry. Anything to eat at home? A few eggs. Just eggs? Did you take Dafu to the doctor again? No. A Doctor Zhou from the People's Hospital called... said your mobile was off. What did she say? Well, nothing special. Her voice was very gentle, I guess she's beautiful, right? Dafu. Did you untie that rope? Don't you want to go with Dad? Don't want to go with Dad. Dad is talking with you seriously. You don't want to go with me, right? Don't want to go with me, right? Don't repeat me, Dafu. If you don't go, but Dad leaves, who'll take care of you? Who will? Dafu, that doggy is not sitting on the TV. Dafu? Where are you, Dafu? Dad can't find you. Where are you? Dafu. We've got meat to eat. Dafu. Why are you back so soon? Did you have fun? Did you have fun? This is all water. You think we just have a tank of fish? If electricity leaks, you won't be able to cover the losses. Check it carefully. Don't be so careless. Do you have a spare wire with you? I forgot. Idiot! Let me do it, Director Tang. You think you can leave work anytime for a tour because you're a long-time staff? The financial crisis means you have to stimulate the economy that much? I'm sorry. Did you take Dafu to the doctor again? No. It was just travel then? Oh my god! Your Dafu is like a fish. Yes. He was born into the wrong body and became a man. That's why he's autistic. More tourists are coming during peak season. So I'll add a fish-feeding program at the start of the day. Tell Dafu to swim some other time, alright? Are you fine? I'm fine. Hi, Dafu. Welcome back. Where'd you go with your dad? Hello Brother. To the sea. Wow, good for you! It must have been fun to go so far. Your dad's so good to you. Dafu. I told you many times. Don't put the doggy on the TV The letter should be in the drawer. Don't touch it. Dafu, you won't swim tomorrow. Did you hear me? Yes. Good. No swimming tomorrow morning. Good boy, Dafu. Good, Dafu. Raise your arms. Scratch me. It's itchy. Raise your arms. Scratch me, it's itchy. Raise your arms. Go to sleep, Dafu. Want to swim. Want to swim. No. Want to swim. No. No. Be good, Dafu. Want to swim. Behave, Dafu. I'll fry you three eggs when we're home. Old Wang. The performance pool's lights aren't working. Take a look. I'm coming. Want to swim. OK.., it's rising. Copy that. Pull the switch! Dafu! Dafu! Dafu! Dafu! Dafu, Dad is coming! Dafu! Dafu! You bloody fool! Come back! You scared me. Come back! Dafu! You naughty boy! You naughty boy! Dafu, remember to greet Principal Liu. To greet her. Good boy, Dafu. Greet Principal Liu when we see her. Dafu. Dafu. Come with Dad. Flowers. Principal Liu. Principal Liu. Dafu, the principal isn't here. Where are your dad and mom? - Be careful. - Dafu. Dafu, don't run. Don't run. Excuse me, we're here to see Principal Liu. Principal Liu retired last year. I'm in charge now. My name is Feng. You're Principal Feng, then. My name is Wang Xincheng. This is my son, Dafu. Hello, Dafu. I'm Teacher Feng. Principal Feng wants to shake your hand. Hurry up. Hello! Hello! Dafu is autistic? We noticed something was wrong when he was about 3 years old. The local hospital said he was mentally retarded. Then we sent him to hospitals in Beijing and the diagnosis was autism. Has he been studying here? He came when he was 8. No school in my hometown would take him. Finally we found only this school takes kids with autism. Then we moved here. Without Principal Liu and the school, Dafu would be worse off. At the beginning, he listened to nothing and rarely talked. How is Principal Liu now? She had a stroke last year. I heard her daughter took her to Beijing for care. Really? What brings you here today? Principal Feng, I want to send Dafu back to school. Send him here again? Peizhi School is an educational institution. And the state regulates nine-year compulsory education. That also applies to kids with mental disorders. Dafu looks older than 16. He's 21. He just had his birthday. Look at this. Late liver cancer? Are you kidding? How could I? When Dafu was 7, his mother died. I'm his only family. If I die, where can I send him? Alright. I'll talk to my superior. But it's unrealistic to have the school adopt him. You could also contact the welfare institution. In your case, I think they'd be responsible. Hello, Auntie Chai. You are early today. Move that here. Dafu, you come and work for me. Nobody can do better than you. It doesn't work. Out of order again? Bad connection, maybe. It's today's beer. No need to pay. Take it as salary for Dafu. You benefited from Dafu. Take it. No thanks. I gave it up. Why? Healthy lifestyle, to live more days with Dafu. Looks like you've got a training plan. I'll take it home to repair. Dafu, try to unlock it on your own. Turn it right. Smart boy, Dafu. Yes, hang it well. Very good, Dafu. Dafu, don't put the doggy on the TV Dafu, eat an apple first. Dad will cook for you soon. Flowers. Dafu. Dafu. Come over, fry the eggs for yourself. Yes, fry the eggs myself. Dafu, take an egg here. Egg. Good boy. Come. Now crack the egg. Lightly crack here. Crack it yourself. Terrific, Dafu. Take an egg yourself. Dafu, crack it yourself. Dafu, do you want to have breakfast? Yes, I do. Do it yourself if you want to eat. Crack it yourself. Good boy, Dafu. Please pick up the ball for me, ok? Please pick up the ball for me, ok? Dafu, what did I say just now? Pay money when buying. You scared him. Don't do that. Come, take whatever you want. Make yourself at home. No, no, no. You can't take whatever you want in a shop. If you want something, what will you do? What will you do? Buy. Good boy, Dafu. What do you use when you buy? What do you use when you buy? What do you use when you buy? Money. Right, Dafu. Look. What do you want? Take a look. What do you want to buy? Buy. I want to buy a refrigerator. Come on, Xincheng. Don't force him. Take it easy. Eat whatever you want. Dafu. This is the biggest, a 1,000 Yuan note. You can buy a lot of things. Now tell me which is the smallest? Dafu, which is the smallest? Dafu, that's it. Our Dafu is really smart. Dafu. If one catty of eggs is 3 yuan, which of the notes will you use? Eat after we finish the exercise, Dafu. One catty of eggs costs 3 yuan, so which of the notes will you use? This one also works. If you buy a fan costing 1,200 Yuan, which of these will you use? Is this enough, Dafu? Take a look. What are you doing, Dafu? Thanks a lot, Director Tang. We've never had such good conditions before. Relax, we'll do our best. You're so generous. We support each other. - Yes, yes, yes. - Director Tang. You're here at the right time. Let me introduce. This is Mr. Wei. And this is Old Wang. He's in charge of water and electricity supply here. Just ask him when you need help. I want to take a leave this afternoon. Why? I have to take a leave. Dafu. Let's go. Dafu. This home takes kids diagnosed with intellectual disabilities and orphans sent by the police. We seldom offer services to individual families. Please. Watermelon. Dafu. It tastes good. Go ahead. Dafu, say thank you. Quickly. You're welcome. No hurry. Don't be rude. Eat slowly. As you can see, we basically take in children. Otherwise, all adults with disabilities would come here. We wouldn't be able to afford it. What about him. Isn't he older? Lele came here before he was a month old. Cerebral lesion. He's an orphan. To be blunt, I'm dying. Dafu will become an orphan soon. Is it ok in that case? Anything wrong? Nothing's wrong. Don't lie to me. I can see it in your face. Just tell me if something's the matter. Maybe I can help a bit. Hello, is this the care center? Hi there. I'd like to know if you accept autistic patients. Yes, I know you're not in charge. But... Hello? My son is very clever. When will you be back from your business trip? What? Age is not a problem. Dafu, we're home now. How do we open the door? With the key. Yes. You're really smart. Where's the key? Where's the key? Don't repeat. Where is the key? The key is around my neck. - Smart boy! Go and open the door. - Wang Xincheng. Why didn't you tell me it's so serious? I'm fine. What happened? Doctor Zhou from the People's Hospital waited more than 2 hours here. This medicine is for you. It's free. It's all right. No place will take him? I can't believe that. I've tried almost everywhere. The orphanage says he's too old and the elderly home says he's too young. Let's go online and look. After Dafu left Peizhi School at 16, I wanted an institute to look after him and give special training. I can't do anything so I have him stay with me every day. How about insurance companies? They don't take applications for people with disabilities. Same with state social welfare. I've already asked. What if we left Dafu at the door of an orphanage? Wouldn't they take him? What if they don't? And even if they do, will they look after him all his life? Will he live happily there? I want to be sure of that before I die. Old Wang, Doctor Zhou only mentioned that result. Doctors always explain the worst-case scenario. Tell me what 3 or 4 months means. A healthy man like you won't die so easily. And even if it's true, I'll take care of Dafu for you. You'll marry someone in a couple of years. How could you keep on taking care of Dafu? I won't marry. You're the only good man in the world. Dafu, be careful. It's too hot. For me? You can read it. Dafu and I are leaving. I've got a few things to entrust you with. Wang Xincheng. What do you mean? I'd rather take him with me... than leave him suffering alone. So your last trip wasn't a tour? We went to our hometown. Dafu's a good swimmer, like his mother. Even the Grim Reaper can't get him. So I think there's some place on earth for him to live. Old Wang. Please come quickly. What's wrong with him? Dafu, give me the balls. Dafu, give me the balls. We'll need them for a show. Would you please stop shouting? You're scaring him. Give me the balls. Don't get involved. Give me the balls. - Dafu! - Anyone looking for him? Dafu! Dafu, Dafu. Give me the balls. Dafu, you're good. It's about my turn. Sorry. Dafu. Dafu, Dafu. Nothing, nothing. Nothing, Dafu. - Dafu. - Old Wang! Are you ok? Old Wang. What's wrong with the boy? Is something wrong with him? Dafu. Is it for me? Dafu. Wait, Dafu. My dad and mom left when I woke up. My grandma said they live across the sea. But I've never seen them again. My grandma calls me Ling. She asked me to wear this. Then she could hear me wherever I went. My grandma lives there. Dafu, my grandma lives there. Why are you clapping? Why are you laughing? What's with the laughter, Dafu? What's so funny? Why are you laughing? Doctor, it's not necessary. I think. you're right. This place isn't suitable for Dafu. Thanks for all you did. That's all right. Let's go. Let's go home, Dafu. Principal Liu? Dafu. It's Principal Liu. Come. Dafu, you'll live here from now on. And this is your home. Understand? This is your home. Dafu is smart. Be sure to brush your teeth before you go to bed. Thank.you, Principal Liu. You should've come to me for something this important. I've heard you weren't well, so... All right, we're entrusting Dafu to you now. Relax. I'll do my best. Thank you. This institution was just set up and the conditions aren't so good. I don't know if Dafu can get used to it. Principal Liu has taken care of Dafu for 9 years. An institution she recommends should be the best. You're not used to it, right? Since Dafu's mom died, this is the first time I haven't needed to worry. It's not something I'm used to. I don't think autism is that bad. They live in their own world without worrying about anything. When I left him, Dafu didn't seem reluctant to say goodbye As you'd know Dafu can't express himself like others do. I never expected Dafu would do anything for me. I'm happy with what he has now. It's pretty good. And I'm relieved. - You're finally here. Hurry! - What happened? He was fine in the afternoon. But he got anxious in the evening. The teachers tried comforting him but that didn't help. Dafu, what's wrong? Dafu. Dafu. Dafu, Dafu. What's wrong? Dafu. Dafu, it's fine. We did exactly what you told us. But he didn't let us touch him. It's fine. Go to sleep, Dafu, Dad won't leave. Dad won't leave. Don't cry, don't cry. Hello, Auntie Chai. You're leaving now? Yes. I've brought up Dafu since he was a baby. He's not used to being without me. I'll stay with him for a while. This is for you. Your old one couldn't be fixed. I got you a new one. Call me when you've got time or I'll worry about you. Dafu is a burden on everyone. I'm his dad so I have to take responsibility. If...if we were together. I'd think it's unfair for you. I'd feel bad. What you said makes me feel good. Otherwise I'd think you were looking down on me. How could I? Dafu. Help me sort out the shelves if you've got time. Sort out shelves. Dafu. Time to go now. Goodbye. Dafu, take a look. This is a long-sleeve, this is a short-sleeve, pants, socks. Look. Long-sleeve shirts, short-sleeves, socks, all on this side. Let's put them in order. This has long-sleeves and what else does too? Long-sleeve. Old Wang, this bed should fit in. Let me push it first. Just big enough. Yes, just enough. Put this on it. Tell me if something's wrong. This is Dafu's birth certificate and this is the bankbook. I planned to work till retirement to save enough to support Dafu. But now... Old Wang, relax. As long as this institution exists, we'll take good care of Dafu. Don't worry. I'll take the birth certificate later on. You keep the bankbook. Then I'll hold onto them. I won't bother you for now. Keep up your good work. Old Wang. It's my pleasure to know a father like you. Dafu. Dad won't be with you someday. You'd miss me, right? You'd miss me, right? Yes, I would. Yes, I would. Dafu, this is Fengshou Road. Fengshou Road. At the end of the road, there's a bus stop. Trees. Look both ways and we'll cross the road. Shangdong Road. Dafu, look. We get on the bus here and we get off the bus here too. Shangdong Road. You clever boy! Dafu, learn to take off your clothes yourself. Raise this hand. Raise it up. Pull it up, like this. Good boy, Dafu. Put an egg inside. Put it inside, Dafu. Put it inside, Dafu. Cover it. Dafu, do you remember the boat when you were little? Dafu, can you go home by yourself today? Yes. Shangdong Road stop. Anybody getting off? Yes. Somebody's getting off at the back.. Anybody in the front? Hey, somebody's getting off! Why didn't you say you're get off? What's with you? I have asked a couple of times. Somebody didn't know you asked. Shangdong Road. Anybody getting off? The bus leaves if there isn't. Shangdong Road. Anybody getting off? Anybody in the front? At the back? The bus leaves if there isn't. Shangdong Road. Anybody getting off? Dafu. Dafu, Dafu. When you hear it's Shangdong Road, you have to say you're getting off. Even if he doesn't look at you, he's asking you. Remember? Remember. Smart boy. Shangdong Road. Anybody getting off? Anybody in the front? At the back? The bus leaves if there isn't. Shangdong Road. Anybody getting off? Yes. Good! Louder. Yes, getting off! I'm getting off! I'm getting off! Shangdong Road. Anybody getting off? I'm getting off! I'm getting off! Very good, Dafu. Son, like this. Come. Do it yourself, Dafu. Squeeze out the water. Dafu, you're excellent. Mop along here. Dafu, use both hands. Use both hands, Dafu. Come back. Both hands. Remember, both hands. Use both hands to mop. Dafu, mop like this. Just remember to mop back and forth quickly. Like this. Dafu, when you mop like that, you'll leave footprints. Mop like this. Take a look after you mop. Your footprints are all cleaned away. Mop this way. Look. So you mop them away. Mop, mop, mop. Why are you so stupid? If you won't remember something so small, never come to the ocean park again. It's nothing. Go slowly. Good boy, Dafu, Go slowly. Good boy, Dafu. Director Tang. Rest a couple of days. That's all right. That's all right. Is Dafu swimming? Maybe. The boy... If Dafu wasn't so...I'd say yes at once. But his condition's so bad and he almost had an accident last time, right? It was my fault last time. I was careless. Dafu usually behaves well. I promise it won't happen again. Director Tang, would you try him out as a cleaner? He's hardworking. Once he learns, he does his best. Keep an eye on him if you want to. I'm sure he'll work harder than others. Old Wang, being a cleaner is no problem. Dafu. Dafu. When it rings it must be Lingling calling. You should answer it, ok? Dafu. Is the phone ringing? Dafu, look. at me. When it rings you should answer it, ok? It's Lingling. Dafu, answer it. Dafu. Dafu, can you hear? Dafu. Dafu, can you hear? It's Lingling. Dafu, can you hear? Dafu. Come, look. Look Dafu. Dafu, come. Look here, here. It's dinner time. We've got cucumber. Yes. Drink some water, Dafu. Dafu, let's go home. Dafu? Dafu? Dafu! Have you seen Dafu? What is it? Dafu's disappeared. Anybody seen Dafu? Dafu? When he's back, tell me straight away. Director, Dafu isn't up there. Keep on looking. If he comes back, I'll call you. Watch your step! Dafu's over there. Dafu! Dafu! Dafu. Take the eggs with you. Dafu likes them. Thank you. So you're back to get your belongings? You really don't need to. Dafu's been accepted there. Isn't it good? Yes. But there's still something I want Dafu to know or I won't be able to relax. Don't give money. I'll be angry if you do. Here's a photo. Put it on the urn when the time comes. Here's some money. No need for an expensive one. Everything is still fine. I'll keep the photo and the other things. Look, Dafu. Sea turtles live the longest. Dad will turn into a sea turtle in a couple of days. Look, Dafu. Don't worry. If no one else accompanies you, Dad will. Look. This is Dad and this is you. Dad. I'll swim with you. Come and swim with Dad. Swim. I'm a sea turtle. A big one, see? Dafu. Dad is a sea turtle. See? Dad is a sea turtle. Take a look, Dafu. Dafu. The sea turtle's getting into the water now. Dafu, the sea turtle is coming. Dafu, here comes the sea turtle. Dafu, is Dad like a sea turtle? How could you swim in your state? And you pretended to be a sea turtle! You're killing yourself. I am fine. Don't swim. You said Dafu's mom died in an accident while swimming. It seems you're asking for trouble too. I'm fine. It won't happen to me. Come on. Dafu's mom was good at swimming. Didn't you tell me that? To tell you the truth, I don't believe she had an accident when she was swimming. What do you mean? Dafu's mom loved him heart and soul. She held him and played with him every day in the water. Later, when we found out Dafu was autistic... ...she couldn't accept it. I don't blame her. Not everyone can face it. Dafu. Dafu. Is Dad like a turtle? Dafu, turtle. Turtle. Director Tang, please include my name in the custodians' list too. In the future, Dafu will stay at my place during the day, just like the old days. Thanks a lot. Here you are. Thanks. Dafu, you've got up. Xiao Ya, let him do it himself. Dumplings for 2 Yuan. A moment please. This is 3 liang for you. Shangdong Road stop. Anybody getting off? I'm getting off. Dafu, remember... Dad is a sea turtle. We're turtles. Let's go swimming. "This film is dedicated to all the ordinary heroes among our parents."
