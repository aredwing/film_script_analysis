I was just fooling around, OK? - Did it bother you? - Yes. But apparently it shouldn't have. I'm not overreacting, other people told me, too. Yesterday, Mike said to me: "This doesn't bother you?" Don't you see yourself? What does Mike have to do with this? The door's open. Why do you think he didn't leave until 3:00 a.m.? - Come on, he knows... - Why did he stay? Don't you think he had a huge hard-on? Maybe he just likes to have fun! Aude was just next to us! I never would've done anything in front of everyone! You're always imagining things! I had fun, nothing happened. Yeah, I know you had fun. Don't worry! I saw that you were having fun. It was good to have everyone together. Your mom was there. It was a really nice dinner. It was a lot of fun. I'm sure you didn't call to talk about your mom. What's up? I was wondering if I could borrow your cottage. Does this weekend work for you? Yeah, this weekend's fine. I was thinking of going up with Hlne, but... OK, well, I don't want to ruin your plans. I promised you could, and a promise is a promise. - You sure you don't mind? - No problem at all. You'll have to talk to the neighbour. He has a spare set of keys. I'll give you his number. - What's his name? - Benot, but you can call him Ben. - I can call him Ben? - For sure. Hi, this is Benot Gignac. I'm not available right now. Leave a message and I'll get right back to you. Hello, Benot. It's Thomas Legault, Michel Legault's nephew. I'm calling because he's lending me his cottage this weekend, and he told me to call you to get the keys. So, give me a call back. My number is 585... Hello. - The voicemail box of... - Benot Gignac. ...is full. To leave a callback number-- I know what you're thinking, but... - No expectations, OK? - No, exactly. We'll see how things go. What is there to do at the cottage? There are some trails. We'll go for walks, wow! Yeah. There's a fire pit. Cool. There's a nice lake. You'll like the lake. - Right by the cottage? - Yeah, it has lake access. There are a couple of boats, too. Are you going to swim? We'll see. I brought my bathing suit. You're just jealous! Not of me, but of the things you can't do! Oh, is that it? You think being faithful is silly, right? I'm not saying that! It's just... You badger me, you question me, and it's infuriating! But you don't see yourself! What do I do that you don't do? You do it on purpose. I do it on purpose. OK, because... You're nave. Have you ever wanted to kiss another girl? Yes. Did you do it? Get out. We were almost there. Damn it... What do we do? We're not far. What are you doing? I'm trying to reach the neighbour. Why? Because he has the keys. What keys? The keys to the cottage. He doesn't have the keys. I'm not even surprised. I don't believe this. I'm not moving anymore. This is it! That's weird! They keys are in the lock. Yes? I'm Michel's nephew, the owner's nephew. You came up with Michel? No, Michel's not here. He lent us the cottage for the weekend. The key was in the door, so we came in. Yeah, that's my key. OK, so you're... Ben? The neighbour, yes. Hi! I was supposed to pick up the key at your place. I called several times, but there was no answer. No, I wasn't at my cottage. So, this is my key? - Right? - Yeah. It's strange, I didn't hear you pull up. No, we... Hang on, I'll close the door. You were expecting us? Well... Actually, I was expecting Michel and his girlfriend. Well, he was supposed to come up... Do you mind if I look around? No, go ahead. I came over earlier. I made dinner. We invite ourselves over up here. - I knew he was coming. - It's nice upstairs. Yeah, it's nice. Well... OK, so... When is Michel coming? - On Monday, I think. - OK. Would you mind if I had a glass of wine? No... It's been a long day. I'll pour some for you. I cooked up some boar and some quail. Come on. We don't want this to go to waste. You do know Michel! This is the kind of thing he likes. I know what he likes. Yeah. Would you look at this! Well, to chance! To chance! To chance! I like chance. Really? How long have you been together? It'll be eight years in November. Eight years. So you're in your seventh year now. That's a tough time. - Really? - No. It's going great. The seven-year itch is a myth. Really? Monogamy's a myth. What do you mean? Monogamy, in today's world... Monogamy with a capital M? Yes, monogamy with a capital M. Why is it a myth? Because it never works? Well, because, by nature, men and women... aren't meant to be together forever. It never works. Why don't people get that it doesn't work? Because it's human nature. Human nature? You feel responsible for the other person, you want to possess them. It's normal to want to possess someone. - It's normal, but... - So to speak. But sometimes... Well, I... The soup is good. - Thanks. - Yeah, thanks. This place brings back memories. Of my cousins. I can imagine. It seemed bigger back then, though. Yeah. It's been a while since you were here? I didn't even know you when... It's been 15 years since I was last here. - Fifteen years! - Since the last time. It's been 15 years since you were here. OK. Did you sleep well? Yeah, very well. Where did you sleep? On the couch downstairs. We can go back if you want. I'll get the car fixed and we can go back tonight. No, we're here. Might as well stay. We have to spend some time together to see that it's not working, no? It's Ben! Of course. Yippee! I'm just trying to be polite. Are we going to spend the whole weekend with him? I've got a joke for you! One butt cheek says to the other butt cheek: "It's amazing that we're still together "after all the shit that's gone down between us!" - Drink up. - I'm almost done. We're moving on to more serious things. Look! I hurt myself. What's the matter? - I... - What's going on? I hurt myself. We have to take care of this. We'll use vodka to disinfect it! It's going to burn. Yes, but it's the best disinfectant. - This isn't pretty... - What are you doing? - This isn't pretty, pretty thing. - What are you doing? You'll see. Sorry... It just stings a bit. It's nice out, huh? Waking up wasn't too hard? No, it was all right. Paddling around the lake is really nice. Do you think we could go for a ride? Sure. You coming? Thanks! I feel like swimming. We could swim here. I'm not swimming here, that's for sure. Go in wearing nothing but your life jacket? That'd be hot, with my socks on, too. Stop it, Marianne! Come on! - This is nice, huh? - Definitely. You didn't have to be aggressive. What do you mean? We take his boat. We leave him there. He's been waiting for an hour. No, he offered. He made us dinner yesterday. I'm just trying to be polite. It's not a big deal... Don't worry, no one's feelings are getting hurt. He offered, so we went. Did you want him to come with us? You drive me crazy. This would be the right time for a fish to jump out of the water. Come on! What's he doing? What's his problem? He doesn't like the water. Oh, I see. Let's play a joke on him. - What? - Let's play a joke on him. What? Thomas, you're missing out. Would you help me up? Stop! Stop! - Sorry. - Thomas... It was a joke! Very good one. - Thomas! - Never mind. He was just joking around. He didn't know. - I said you didn't like the water. - Of course! You're stupid, or what? Thomas? Damn it! Holy shit, Legault! - Yeah? - How's it going? Hi. You don't recognize me? I'm sure I know you, but... Steve! Man, it's been a long time. Yeah! Is that your car? I'm in the ditch. I can't get it to start. Can you bring me into town? I'd like to find a garage. Sure! Grab your things. You'll have to squeeze in the back. I'll just lock the doors. Did you ever ride a horse naked? Did you ever do that? All the time, man. We called it the Adam and Eve trip. We were really into it. All weekend long. You get on the horse naked, no saddle... I thought the horse was riding you. You're sick. Since you got Internet access at home, you've got funny ideas. Ride the horse, on top... Wasn't he bringing me to a garage? My uncle's got a garage. We'll send you a tow truck. Chill out. Your uncle has a tow truck? Yes, he has a tow truck. He's got a full garage. Relax. Have fun. Sorry. Would you like to go for a walk? That is so not funny. I'll get my things. Come in. Shall we? I'm just going to take a picture. The light is so nice. It's incredible. You're photogenic. - I'll take one of you. - No! Ah, you see? It's... It's beautiful. Thank you. How did you find this spot? I've been coming here forever. Sometimes... there are places that just call out to you. Yeah, the bugs are out! How's your wound? You want to see? Yes, the doctor's doing his rounds. - It's just the Band-aid. - Let me see. It's all right. It's just a scratch. - You sure? - Yeah, it's fine. Just when you think you're away from it all, you hear the sounds of civilization! Should we go back? Thomas? There's a nice fire pit here. We could make a fire later. - Maybe later. - That'd be cool. Great. OK. Have a good nap. Move! Watch out! I'd move over if I were you. I'll just pour on a bit. Be careful with that. With what? It's a lighter! Merry Christmas! - His cousin was... - Rousseau. Rousseau, that's right. Simon and Ren. What they would do was park their truck five minutes from a cottage. The people inside weren't from around here. They were on vacation. They were renting the cottage. They'd walk up slowly and wait for the people to go to bed. They'd wait for two hours after the light went out. They'd go inside and make noise until a nightlight would come on, so they'd know the woman had woken her boyfriend up. The guy gets up, and they'd start making noise in another room. They'd move around, and every time the boyfriend would go into a room, they'd make noise at the other end of the place! - They freaked people out. - Seriously! They chased people away for two summers until no one wanted to rent on the lake anymore. - They never got caught... - Never. We knew about it because they would always take a keepsake. Something dumb like a toaster or a bra belonging to the old lady from Vermont... They were crazy, I swear. If you spent a weekend up here with them, you'd never want to come back. They're a little tamer now. They still play pranks, but they've got kids, so that's calmed them down. Yeah, is there any left? I don't want to smoke the filter. I found this. It's one of Michel's sweaters, in case you get cold. Thanks. Bandage. - You're gonna put a bandage on it? - Yes. He's like a real doctor. No. Maybe that's Thomas getting back? If he's on the road... the neighbour's dog might be... Maybe. Maybe he can't find his way back. He's been here often, and when we arrived, it was almost dark. I'm sure he'll be here soon. Thanks, I'm all right. I'm still a little off from... Yeah. That's what weekends are for. Loosening up. A hairy thigh! A cardboard knee! A foot to marry! A foot to marry Madeleine A foot to marry Maddy Steve... I really have to get back. My girlfriend doesn't even know you picked me up. - You're staying here. - You miss getting slapped around? The neighbour's been hovering around her. - It's pissing me off. - The neighbour? Kojak? - So that's where you're staying... - Kojak? Who's Kojak? His uncle is Michel Legault. What's Kojak? Is the neighbour's name Kojak? It's because he doesn't have a hair on his head. So his name isn't Kojak? What's his name? I don't know his name. We've always called him that. "It smells like mustard," somebody said... It smells like mustard... You don't know who it is? Nature is great. It's inspiring. It's very beautiful. There was... I was at a restaurant one time, and there was a couple at the table next to ours. They were talking, and the woman wasn't the guy's wife. It was clear that she wasn't his wife. It was weird because they were whispering to each other, but we could hear them. And we felt like we had gone somewhere we didn't belong. We knew everything that was going on. He was saying... "I'm going to tie you up. "I'm going to handcuff you. "I'm going to take control." We were listening to this, and it was fascinating to see how much... It changed our night, that's for sure. It was titillating. But they were really talking about... Have you ever done that? Been tied up... Been someone's prey... Now you can't get away... - I have a watchdog. - Yeah? Watch out, he bites. - Let go. - No. I don't want to play this game. I want to hold your arm so you can't get away. Just to see how long you can take it. I can take it. I'm tired. I want my arm back. - We'll see. - I need it to drink. I drink with both hands. I need my... Please. - You're back? - Did you sleep well? Move. Do you know that guy? You don't know that guy! We don't know who that guy is. You know what they call him in town? They call him Kojak. Does he look like Kojak to you? We don't know who he is. He's clingy, something's not right about him! He's not the neighbour! You're paranoid. You're imagining things! Marianne! Marianne... What are you doing? I think I lost my camera when we went... I was looking for the stream. It isn't this way. I thought it was on the other side of the hill, but I always get lost. Have you been looking for a while? No, I walked up along the ridge, but... I couldn't find the stream. Well, that's the right path, but... I didn't find it. I can show you if you want. I'll go the cottage... first. OK. I'll see you there... in 20 minutes? Sure. You were right. What? We're leaving. What do we do? Leave on foot? What the hell does he want from us? And if he's not the neighbour, what did he do with him? Where's the car? Could you find it again? I could find it. We'll take his keys and drive off in his car. He's coming to pick you up? I'm ready. Wow! You look pretty! Thanks. Shall we? Yeah. I don't know how I managed to get lost. I thought that if I continued going straight... It's so easy to get lost in the woods. It'd be a shame if... That was a nice camera you had. Ben? Yes? What are you doing? What do you think? Like this? Like this. - Easy... - Like this. Easy... Like this? - Like this? - Yeah. Do it... Yeah, OK... Thomas! What are you doing? Come back here! Did you enjoy that? The food was good? The drink was good? Good! Come sit down. Are you comfortable? Hi, Jean. How are you, Jean? Who are you? - Did you look for the keys? - Yes. They're not on him. What do you want? There's a big fly biting you. Hurts, doesn't it? Did you enjoy yourself? That's the last time you'll grab my girlfriend's ass, you prick. Get back! - That's the last time! - Come on, hit me. Where are the keys? Did you enjoy yourself? Don't touch me, you prick. Get back! You want to play? OK, we'll play! You want to play baseball? - Come on... - Oh yeah? Come on! Hit me! Let go! Give me that! Where are the keys? Answer! Where are the keys, damn it? We just want to know where... Give us your keys! Come on! Do it! Come on, hit me! - I slept with her. - It's not true! Now we're talking! Let's just go to the car, Thomas. Come here. I have something to tell you. He just kissed me! He's the one who kissed me. I swear I didn't do anything. It's true, you don't remember. Of course not, you were asleep. The first night... You'd had a lot to drink. You don't remember? Bottoms up! It burns! You drank too much, you passed out, I picked you up. He was passed out downstairs. I carried you up. Yeah! I undressed you... completely. It's not true! Marianne... You don't remember what happened? No, that's right. You were asleep. Yeah, you liked it! You remember now? Is it coming back to you? Is it coming back? I got on top of you! Oh, you liked it! I raped your girlfriend! - Stop it! - I fucked her! Come on! Hit me! Do it! Pick up the shovel! You can do it! I fucked her and she liked it! She yelled my name, not yours! Get back! Shut up! Hit me! Don't think about it! Let's go. We're going. Wait. Let me see! Someone's there... Come here. I'll go see. Your sweatshirt! Hello. Can I help you? You're the guy who put his car in the ditch? Yes, that's me. Are you Luc's uncle? Well, give me your keys. It's all right. It's the guy from the garage. I don't know how to feel. I don't feel a thing. What have we done? - What if we get caught? - Stop. - What if we get caught? - Nothing happened, OK? We won't talk about it. We'll never talk about it again. It'll be all right. Who is it? It's Michel. - Hi. - Hi. I'm glad to see you! We were just leaving. You have to stay and have lunch with us, that's for sure. Good to see you. - You too. - Hello! Marianne! So, did you have a good weekend? Yeah, we had fun. - Hi. - Hlne... - Marianne. - Hi, Marianne. - Hi. - And Thomas, my nephew. Nice to meet you. Weren't you leaving yesterday? Yeah, exactly. We're going. That's not what I meant! I've got some really good stuff. I'll cook something up. Nice bottle of wine... We don't want to cramp your style. You like the cottage? It's comfortable? - It's peaceful here. - It's quiet. - No telephone... - I'm going inside. I'll just grab our things from the car. Did you lock the back door? No, we haven't finished bringing everything out yet. Is that so? Did you go out in the boat? It's silly, but I love it! We go out all the time. We leave at dawn, the lake is so still. It's like a mirror. - And then... - Some salad? ...we take all our clothes off, and we jump in the lake. It's getting kind of personal. Blessed peace. It's good to get out of the city. - Exactly... Sorry. - The noise... It's so quiet here. No telephone, right? That helps. Yeah, it's... Well... You can talk about it. It's all right, he's my nephew. The thing is, her ex... In fact, your uncle got me out of there, thank God! Jean is a good guy, but he has problems. Yes. He calls me. He won't stop. I had to call the phone company. But he goes to... - He followed her. - He goes to shopping malls. He calls me from pay phones. I told you to call the police. He's got problems, it's all right to be patient, but there's a limit. Anyways, you know what I think. Yes, I know. - I'm very patient... - Yes, and I appreciate it. I know it's your thing, but it involves me a bit too since we're together. Oh yeah, Ben! You haven't mentioned Ben! How was the handoff of the keys? We didn't see Ben. The key was in the lock when we got here. He left the key in the lock? I figured that he got my message. He knew we were coming. Well, I called him. He was supposed to greet you and everything... Maybe something came up? Maybe he had to go back to Montreal. - But he would've called you. - That's what I don't understand. Are you worried? - Not especially. - You want to go see? Yeah, if you don't mind. The thing is, we have to... leave soon. Yeah, we can't stay. Ben! It's me. It'll be all right, Ben. Hang on. When I see something and I don't talk about it, I feel like it doesn't exist. But it does exist. Theoretically, yes, but if I... If I don't tell someone about it, I'm like: Did I dream that? Did it really happen?" You can live something with someone, and you don't have to talk about it. You already share it with the person who you experienced it with. In fact, what I mean is... the only thing that can keep a couple together is a secret. I don't know if I'll be able to not talk about it.
