Get a job, you stinkin' hippie! Whoo! This one's comingny. I can't do this. This is not the time to be discussing this, jade. I can't do it well, maybe we can just wait until we cross the border. Welcome to Canada. Hi. Purpose of your trip? Uh, we're immigrating. Ah. Reasons for your immigration, sir? Well, I'm a conscientious objector to the Vietnam war. Ahh. I love you, redwood. Ethan, I'm leaving. Jade... this is crazy, jade. I can't do it. No, no. It's not too late. I can't leave. Just wait, all right? Excuse me. Am I interrupting something? Jade, this is crazy! Jade! One moment, please. Hey. Hey. Hey, hey! Listen... listen to me, okay? You know I can't go back. It could be dangerous. There's more to it, you know that! Excuse me, sir. If you... just one moment for me, please. Sure, sure. - Jade, listen. - Let go of me! No. Hey, hey. Let go of me! You can't leave us! Let go of me! - You can't leave us! In other news today... golfing great Jack nicklaus, three masters championships nicklaus has not won a major resulting in firing of his long-time caddy, with this move, nicklaus is hoping to once again capture the magic he once possessed and winher green jacket at the masters. I can't! Just stop! Please. Just stop. I don't really remember when my mother left, when I was introduced the parting of ways has not been favorable to the trinidadian. Jack nicklaus is the best even without ruben... And when I beat Jack, everything will go back redwood forest Hansen has got 175 yards to the treacherous 16th hole at Augusta national. Nicklaus is safely on... 40 feet from the pin. A good approach shot here should give him a great chance, with three holes left to beat Jack nicklaus and capture his first green jacket at the masters. Scott... Never have we seen an 11-year-old at this position at the masters. It's an incredible, Charles, just incredible. Yeah! It ain't over, red. Jack's on that dance floor, too, and he's good with that flat stick. Yeah, but that is tight, ruben, and Jack's got an uphill slider. Redwood! Keep your focus, red. We got three holes left. Eyes on the prize, baby! Eyes on the prize. Redwood, dinner! Dad, I'm on 16, and just hit it tight, and Jack hasn't hit yet! Well, Jack's going to have to wait till tomorrow, 'cause you're already a half-hour late. Move it! Dad! I could be on my way to my first masters title. No 11-year-old has ever gotten this close. Do you know how hard it is to beat Jack nicklaus? I mean, everything would change. Custom paint job? Hey, jonno. Yeah, not bad for $13.99, huh? No wonder you're still single. What's up? Sorry I didn't call. You got any time? Aww, for you, my man, anytime, anytime. How's red? Well, it's more like "where's red?" Looking good, man. What on earth are you feeding these things? Thanks, man. Classical music. Yeah, it helps them relax and grow. No shit. Yeah. "Mozart's flute concerto number 2 in d-major" seems to work the best. Well, helps, don't it? Speaking of growing... Little man! Uncle jonno! Hey-hey! Not cool, red. I'm gonna have to get you a watch. But, dad, I hit it stiff on 16, and Jack has a 40-foot slider, and not to mention that ruben says 18 fits my fade perfectly. I'm telling you, dad, I've got him, I've got Jack. All right, that's enough. - But I... - Red. Please, man... just chill. Come on, now. Better listen to your old man. Let me see those pipes. Yeah, there we go! I don't want to get too big, because it's bad for the backswing. You know, Jack says that. That's good. All right. So, you fill out that paperwork yet? No, man. You know, man, that war should never have started. I dig ya, I do... But it's over now. At least Carter's giving you a chance to go home. Not interested. I mean, the best thing I ever did, besides him, was leave. I mean, I would have never made it out alive. Imagine me with a gun? True. It's good weed, man, good weed. Thanks. Dad... Yeah, red? You said that when the war was over, that maybe we could go to Oregon... And see my mom. Come on, man. You know it's more complicated than that. But you said that we could go to Oregon when the war was... please. Please, man. But you never keep your... redwood! I'm sorry, man, all right? It's just... We can talk about this later, okay? Yeah, okay. Now, you have to go get ready for dinner. Go wash your hands. Can jonno stay? All right, yeah. Yeah, for sure. It's your turn to do the dishes. Sounds tough. Yeah, well, I just haven't been able to tell him what the real deal is about his mom, you know? But it's time... That kid's ready to know. Listen, man, I've been meaning to ask you. Can you get a hold of any, uh... White stuff? The cocaine, man. I didn't think that was your kind of high, jonno. It's not. I got a couple friends looking for... A different kind of party. Da cocaine, man. Can you get a handle on more? Yeah, I mean, I can get a line on as much as you... red! Come on, man! Go get ready. Evening, sports fans, to the late night edition where we always keep youolf. I am your host, and do I have a big surprise the 1975 classic finish and I got chillsut it. So let me send youn crime, who always calls it straight, Charlie renfrew. The pressure here the galleryneedles. Nicklaus has just hit a wonderful approach shot... ...at the 16th green. He's now gotfoot slider... ...he's only about 100 yards away from where weiskopf hit that putt. Now, up the hill... Fantastic, he's done it! Oh, what a finish! And now the stage shifts... Back to the 11-year-old sensation redwood forest Hansen. Inside left. Firm. He's got about... A 10-foot puttck, who's sitting at 8 under par. It looks... Good! Yes! Redwood forest Hansen makes birdie and is tied with Jack nicklaus going into the 17th tee-box at Augusta national! Redwood. Hey, man, it's after midnight. You have school tomorrow. I know it's your last day of school before summer break, but not to mention the boob-tube's only to be watched with adults, huh? But, dad, I just made birdie to tie Jack with two holes left going... you know, it wouldn't matter if the dalai lama made an eagle. You know better, man. Everyone else gets to watch television. Why can't I? 'Cause we're not everybody. Come on, red... You'll thank me someday for this, man. You don't see it now, but you will. It's no big deal, man. I love you, man. You want to look at the photo albums before we go back to bed? You said we could talk about Oregon. Yeah... yeah. I guess I did. You know, man... Life can be heavy. You know... And sometimes things are just hard to explain, but I guess you're old enough now to understand. I mean, when I was a kid, it took me years to understand anything, literally. But you... You're just... You're way more progressed than I was at your age. Hands down. Oops! Uh... a little too soon for that, though! So, uh... What was I saying? Are you stoned? I'm fine. Oh, shit. You're stoned. Here, drink this. You hungry? - Yeah. - Yeah. So, I think you were around five, when I was first able to contact your mom again. Jade. So beautiful to me. She'd been gone for a couple of years, and, uh, everything was a struggle. Everything. We agreed to meet, but the border was a little too tough for me at that time, and-and her life... Well, her life was... was difficult. But I want you to know, red, that we did everything we could to try and stay in touch, all right? Especially for you. But... truth is, your mom moved on... And our lives all continued separately. And I had to deal with it, and she had to deal with it, and now you, you deserve the truth, man. Yeah, your mom doesn't really live in Oregon, she lives in California. She has another family. Redwood! Redwood! Wait up! Come on, redwood, wait up! Did you see Charlie's angels last night? The girls discovered a black market for babies, for real! You know I'm not allowed to watch television, and that it isn't real. Well, farrah fawcett is the most beautiful woman in the whole world, and that's for real. Yeah, well, Jack nicklaus is real too, and he's the best golfer in the world, maybe even the entire universe. Farrah would beat him easily. Okay, no! No way! Jack has five green jackets. Well, farrah's married to the $6-million man, you know. Do you even know what the green jacket is? Here. When you win the masters, you get a specially fitted green jacket just for you. It's like magic, and it can change everything. Well, maybe Jack has a magical green jacket, but my dad says farrah could suck the chrome off a bumper. I gotta go. What's up? Nothing, I just... Gotta go. Can I come over? Not today, Ruby. I'm sorry. But you never let me come over. What's up? A grey van followed me home. Okay, get in. Go get your things. Dad? Red, you know the drill... go get your things. Hey, jonno. Hey, kid. What's up? There's cops outside, man. Gotta get rid of the coke. Come on, jonno! They got the place surrounded. What? All the doors are covered. Get yourself a good lawyer, all right? Dad? Red! Stay put, red. Give me a minute with him. - Listen, I can't do that. - Come on! It's against protocol. Screw protocol! You're a rat! Ah! Red... It's gonna be okay, man, all right? You're gonna be just fine. Ow! Oh! Come on, red! Let's go. - Get down! Now! Police! - Down on the ground! All right, all right! - Down on the ground! - All right! It's gonna be all right, red, it's gonna be okay. Just chill, man. - Just... oh! - No! Your bus is leaving in 10 minutes, redwood. We've contacted your mother, and she's gonna pick you up somewhere near Redding. I know it's a long journey, but you'll be there in no time. Look, I know things are tough right now, but we'll work everything out. Okay? You must be tired. It's a long trip, isn't it? I... I got to apologize right away for the living situation at the house. It's kind of cramped, but it's all we've got right now. Redwood, I'm not sure what your father has told you. This has taken us all by surprise. I have two older boys. Josh is 15 and Todd is 13. You play golf? Yeah. Bet you're pretty good. I'm tied with Jack nicklaus with two holes left at Augusta national. Ruben says I might have a chance to beat him. Jack fired ruben, back in '68, when his luck was down, but I got him to carry my bag now. It wasn't his fault Jack's putts weren't falling. Sounds like an interesting guy. It'll be my first green jacket. We live up here. Scott... Jack nicklaus is on the 17th tee-box and is currently tied with redwood forest Hansen. Nicklaus hits a nice tee shot, Charles, straight down the middle. Redwood forest Hansen is up next. Let's see what he can do for this critical 17th tee shot. What've you been doing? Beating rocks with it? Dry it when you put it away, Todd. Pay attention. That's Hank. He's harmless and blind. Hon? This is redwood. That's Arnold. Hello. Hey there. And that's Josh... And Todd. Hello. Look at his hair. Hope you don't feel too crammed up here with the boys. Now that Arnold's not working at the mill, he might have some time to fix up a new room for you. They had some layoffs, but we'll be fine. I picked up some shifts at the supermarket. You okay? I know it's a lot... Hey. I got an idea. Why don't you help me make dinner? We're having short ribs. No, thanks. I don't eat meat. Oh. I eat tofu. It's soy-based and a good substitute. High in protein, too. Okay... I'll go to the store then and get you some tofu. I know this is tough, but it's gonna get better. Promise. Jade? Yeah? I like my tofu slightly burnt. So I saw a couple deer today, down at the end of the field. Figure we'd get out there... What's that? Tofu. Redwood's a vegetarian. Can I try some? Eat your food, honey. Todd, eat your food. If I catch you giving anything to Hank, you're gonna be cleaning the toilet with your toothbrush. Well, I don't like the brown things. - Ow! - Eat it. Ow... But... But what if I'm a vegetarian, too? Shut up, Todd. You don't even know what a vegetarian is. - Do too. You do not. I do, too. You do not! Guys. You're giving me a headache. You see, this is what happens... people get special treatment. He's gonna have to start eating what we eat. You ask me, the kid could use putting on a couple of pounds. Well, it's not a problem for me to do it. Plus, tofu is soy-based, and it's a good substitute for meat, and it's high in protein, too. You don't say? The lady at the store told me. Uh-huh. Well, you suit yourself, but that looks like crap to me. More like dog crap to me. That's enough, Josh. The reality, in this house, is that nobody gets a free ride. - Arnold. - Nobody. It's just tofu. No free rides. He's gonna live here, he's gonna have to live under the house rules. He can take over wood-chopping duties from Todd, he can help with the laundry. Maybe it's time for a haircut, too. Arnold! What do you think of that, red? It's okay. I'm tied with Jack with two left, and once I win my magical green jacket, I can... Who? Who's Jack? Listen, kid. From what I hear about your father and his troubles, Jack ain't gonna be able to do shit for you. Arnold, that's enough. ...Ow. Hank! Toilet patrol. Dad! No "but" s. And if I catch you giving that goddamn dog any more food, you're gonna be doing a lot more than just cleaning toilets. That dog's about one short rib away from a heart attack. - You understand me? - But I... enough! What'd you do? Forget? You know how he gets when he hasn't eaten! Red... You keep your nose out of things that don't concern you. You understand? I would prefer "redwood," please. Promised me you wouldn't let this back into our life, and here it is. I promised you that it was over with Ethan. The kid looks just like him. Every time I look at him, that's who I see. I never promised that I wouldn't see my son again. He just got here. Can you please give it some time? How about you give me some time? Huh? What about Todd and Josh? Now it's special treatment for red. Is that what it's gonna be? Do you have any idea how hard I work to make my boys men? Do you have any idea? You know that I do, but he's here, and I'm not pushing it on you. I didn't make this happen. It's just the way that it is. "Just the way it is." I've heard that my whole life. And this guy won't give me a goddamn break! Great, you're gonna wake up the kids. 17th tee-box. Good morning. You sleep okay? Yeah. You, uh... Need help with that? Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great. Why don't you grab the door? And here. We'll need this. Follow me. Now, you have to promise me you won't let Arnold and the boys know I let you meet Earl, 'kay? Okay. He's perfectly harmless. Danny? Breakfast time, Earl. Who's this little pecker? This is my youngest son, redwood. Redwood, this is Earl. Huh. It's a boy. I thought it was a girl with that hair. Since when do hippies roam the links? You're welcome, Earl. So this is the one you had with that damn long-hair. Eat your food, Earl! Is he crazy? The doctor says he's delusional, but he wouldn't hurt a fly. Who is he? He's Arnold's father. And why is he down here? Okay. This stays between you and me. If Arnold even knew you met him, it wouldn't be good. 'Kay. Earl had a wife named Mary and another son named Danny, Arnold's younger brother. One day, when Arnold was 15, they went out hunting and... there was an accident, and Danny was killed. How? An accident. He was shot! It was an accident, redwood. Arnold thought he was a deer. Earl couldn't handle it. He kind of went crazy and locked himself downstairs. Mary left him six months later. The doctors recommended that he be put in a psychiatric ward, but Arnold couldn't do it. So, instead, I moved in, and we took care of him. He's hasn't left the basement since. 17th tee-box. Redwood is tied with nicklaus, who is safe on the fairway. Redwood forest Hansen needs to stay focused. That's for sure! Got to hit that fade, redwood! Keep it smooth. Two holes left, and we're tied! Remember, redwood, you win the masters, and we can... Change everything. I know, ruben. I know. That's a great shot, Charles! Right next to Jack's... that's a pretty shitty swing, kid. What? You heard me. Shit! It's shit. Well, don't just stand there like a stunned ferret. Come over here. What do you want? Here... take it. What is it? Take the damn thing! Who are you talking to? Look, if Josh or dad catch you back here, you're gonna be in big trouble. Dad calls this place "the shit," like 'nam. Come on, let's go... hey! You know dad doesn't want you back here. Shit! Let go! Hey, shut up. Understand this, you shithead, I'm watching you. "You got access. "I got the secret. Deal or no deal, that is the question." Charles... Redwood has a 180-yard approach shot onto the 17th. Seeya, Hank. Charles, this is a crucial approach shot on the 17th for young redwood forest Hansen. Now, Jack is safely on in two, and they are... Currently tied, at 8-under. Keep it steady, red! Nice and smooth, now. Ooh! A nice shot, Scotty. He is right beside Jack's approach... But he has broken his club. Charles, this looks... Bad. Let's go, boys. Time to get on your feet. Come on. Up, up, up, up, up, everybody. You're already dressed. Good. Red's already dressed, boys, and goddamnit, Todd, I hate repeating myself. Come on! We're goin' huntin'. On the porch at 0900 hours. Everybody. Let's go. Smells like ass up here. What's with the club? I'm tied with Jack for my first green jacket. What? You've never heard of the masters? No. Well, you can win a green jacket. It's magic. Magic. Yeah, you can do anything you want with it. What would you do? With what? With the magic green jacket. I'd send my dad to Vietnam. He wanted to go, but he has flat feet. You look ridiculous, red. Put this on. Keep that barrel down, Todd. Turn around. Dad! Turn around! You could've killed someone. Okay, that's enough. Get up. Get up. Jesus, Todd. You be quiet. Pull my finger. Get up, buddy. Right here. Right here. Come on. Give 'er a pull. Huh? Okay. Same rules apply. Josh leads. If we hear a kill, we keep our voices down. You blow the call, you blow it for the team, and we don't let the team down, right? Right? Right! Okay. This is the real deal for you, no starter pistols. It's time to make you a man, and a man uses a colt. This, right here, is the colt sharps deluxe. Single-shot rifle, 30-inch tapered barrel, quarter-rib, Fleur-de-lis pattern. Look at it. You know who Samuel colt was? No. No? Well, they say old Abe Lincoln, he might've freed all men, but Sam colt, he made 'em all equal. Here. Take it. Put your arm over... Rest it on your wrist. You keep the barrel down at all times. Remember, this one's got a lot of kick, all right? You pay attention out there. There's no room for mistakes. None. You understand? Okay. Okay. Take the lead, Josh. Let's go get a deer. If it gets your scent, it'll run, and I don't want you guys just shooting. We don't want lose a kill. Fire straight up in the air. Bang. 9 times out of 10, it'll freeze. Sometimes, it'll turn right around and look at you, and then you drop it. One shot, one kill. Oof! Get your head out of your ass, Todd. That's impossible, dad. Shut up, Josh. Quiet. Todd, take red, and go around the flank. Josh, you come with me. What do we do? I don't know. Did he say "flank?" Yeah. All right, follow me. What? You hear that? What is it? It's gotta be a deer. My dad says, if it's one crack, take it slow. If it's two, something like "run." What? See? I was right. One crack, redwood... One crack. Do you really think we should shoot it? Josh got the last one. It's my turn, redwood. But what if it... shh... Todd, I think I see... be quiet! - Todd, I see... - Would you... dad! I got it! You stupid idiot! I had it all lined up! It was mine, redwood. One crack! One crack! Ugh! Tied on 17th. Both puttin' for birdie. Get up, redwood. Get up. Honey, I'm so sorry. This should never have happened, and I promise you it won't ever happen again. It's okay, I'm fine. It's not okay. At least I can still see out the other one. That's not funny. Ow. Sorry. Well, I do have some good news. Your father sent a letter for you today. He did? Is he okay? He's okay, but things are bit complicated right now. Well, can I go back now? It looks like they're moving him back to California. What do you mean? Your father's being extradited, which means... Well, it means... That, a long time ago, your father left for Canada because it was safer for him there, and then when he was arrested in Canada, the police in California wanted him back here. They're kind of trading him. Like if Jack nicklaus got traded to Europe for Tony jacklin? Yeah, kind of. Well, can I go see him soon? Not yet, honey, but now that he's closer, we might be able to soon. We'll just have to wait and see, okay? 'Kay. Here. I think you should have this. "Jade, long time, no talk. "I'll apologize right off the bat "for putting you in this position, "so thank you for taking care of redwood. "I'll also acknowledge that you were right. "In the long run, "everything does catch up to you. "The d.A. In merwin county "still wants me after all these years. "He's working out a deal to extr... "extra... "extract me back to California, "to stand trial for that drug stuff in '69. "I might get some sort of plea deal, "but my lawyers are working on that right now, "so we'll have to see. "I don't know how to explain all of this to redwood, you might want to just..." Did you read the note? What? I said, did you read the damn note? Yeah. Well, what do you think? Dad, I'm coming in, all right? The Spanish bulls been riding hard this year, Danny. Dad, it's lunchtime. You got to win to the crowd when they come out, comprende? All the little hooves, giving you the numbers... uno, dos, tres! Dad, that's enough. Here, take this with your water. You got to take this, okay? It helps. You little piss-wipe. Dad, take it. Good. I'll see you later. And? "And?" And? "And" what? The note! I don't understand it. "You got access. I got the secret." Come in. We need a meeting. No one's gonna hurt you, kid, believe me. You like television? Yeah. I got a special wire hooked up, called an "antenn-I-a," gives you nine channels. Real beauty set-up. What's your favorite show? "Birdie." Scott melnachuk. Charlie renfrew. Yeah, you get it? That's negotiable. You ever see the 1975 masters at Augusta national? Of course. Jack nicklaus sinks a 40-foot slider and Scott melnachuk says "that's a dagger in the heart." Really? Yeah. Then I step up to my 10-footer. Ruben says it breaks a little right. "Ruben?" Yeah, ruben Malone. Jack fired him back in '68, but he carries my bag now. So, anyway, I hit it firm, and... Clunk! Into the hole. So that ties it up, with two left. - You know 17? - Sure. Fits my fade perfect. Jack hits at 10 feet, though. I hit my approach inside his... but Jack sinks his birdie putt to go up one, at 9-under. That's where I stand now, I'm back one, putting for birdie, but then my dad got extracted. "Extracted?" Yeah, but if I could beat Jack over these last two holes, I'll be able to win that magical jacket, and then I'll be able to change everything back to the way it was before. Really? Yeah. Back to when my dad was happy. I mean, I can't really remember when that was, but it was when my mom was around. That's incredible. You know, I definitely think we can make a deal here. But first... someone behind me? Hah. Quick bugger. It's the damn broccoli. Now, where were we? Why were you yelling before? It's a cover. Learned it in the second world war, and it's worked for over 20 years. You were in the war? Mm, sort of. I was at a camp in Arizona. Flat feet. They think I'm delusional. Nuts. So here's my proposition... You have access, and I have... - ...the secret. - The what? The secret, kid. To what? To golf. To beating Jack. Jack nicklaus? Yup. I mean, his back will be done by 40, from that reverse "c" he's been working on anyway. Jack is the best golfer ever. Probably in the entire universe. Come on, kid! You ever hear of Bobby Jones? I saw him. I saw him, kid, in Portland, in 1946. Amazing. He... is the best ever. And Jones had this beautifully relaxed turn. Nicklaus is too mechanical, he's too rigid. Now, I know, it's modern, but that is why he's gonna go in the lower back. I can guarantee you, kid, happens all the time. Snap! Now, nicklaus, he's good, kid, but you've got to look at his predecessors. Now, that's the problem around here's, no respect for the elderly. You play? Played. Club champ '47, but then I developed this wicked hook off the tee, it's kid of like hogan, only I couldn't get out of it. And then I got the yips, and that was more or less the nail in the coffin. So you want to beat Jack and get that magical jacket? Yeah. Well, you're gonna need my help. You'll need the secret. Like I say... You got access. I want better food. No more scraps. And broccoli gives me gas... remember that. And coffee. Okay. Cream and two sugars. Yeah, okay. And chocolate. Chocolate? Chocolate! I haven't tasted my sweet princess in so long! The Nazis upstairs are keepin' us apart. Deal? Deal. You show with chocolate, we get started. "You might want to "just give it to him to read, "he's a tough kid. "Please tell himim. Signed, Ethan." Charles... 17th green. Nicklaus has made his birdie putt to go up one, at minus-9. A 10-footer, right to left. It could pick up a little speed. Right around the hole. Deep breath, red... Soft hands. To tie for the lead. Currently down one. But I'm gonna learn the secret for 18, just in time for my dad to get extracted. It's your time, red, it's your time. Aww! Mommy! Mommy... Down one going into 18. ...Ah-hah. Oh, it's good, but cold. Next time, more sugar, and heat 'er up. Jackpot! Ohh, that's beautiful. Just beautiful. My sweet princess... Come to me. So what's the secret? Ohh... my sweet God. Earl! Could you break up the moment that I've been waiting for, for years? Why can't you just go get it yourself? I got lots on my plate, kid... Got lots to do, rather than be with a snot-nosed... I missed my putt on 17 to tie Jack going into 18, and now I'm down one. You're gonna have to hit a fade off that 18th tee-box, you know? I know. It's a little dog-like. Mm-hmm, a little trouble on the right. You're gonna need the secret, it'll help you putt the hook, which will kill you. I'm ready. What the hell is that? My club. We can't work with that! Come on, over here. Still got the old... ...the old sticks. Just the 7-iron and the putter, lost the rest to anger. There are balls in the bag, you try that. What are you doing? It's an old trick. Desperate times... Lead to desperate measures. Even your buddy, Jack, used to do that. All right, let 'er rip. Wow. Yeah, my dad says that I can be anything I want, as long as I put my mind to it. He says that everything is thought-force, that the mind can lead you toward enlightenment or delusion. He says, you just got to train it, like a bicep. That's logical, I guess. We're best friends, you know? Interesting. Hold the finish! That's very good. Great swing, kid, very good. Now... I'm gonna show ya... The secret. Yeah? Take the club back. Now, hold it at the top of the swing, and then... You do... This. That's it? That's it. Hogan, varden, Jones, nicklaus... they all do that. - Jack does that? - Yes, sir. Now give it a try. Let the dog out... Then cast on through. "Dog?" Come on, kid! Let the dog out. Now hold the finish! Wow. ...Time's up. Keeps me regular. That should help you on 18. Thank you. Earl, can I ask you a question? Sure, kid. Why don't you ever leave the basement? I mean, it's so nice outside... Time's up. But it can't hurt to... that's enough! More chocolate. Keep the coffee hot next time. A deal is a deal. But if you just tried... go on! Get out of here! Good night, Earl. Good night, kid. What's up, brat? I couldn't help but notice some of my belongings went missing. You wouldn't know about that, would you? So, when I went through your belongings, I happened to find this. Listen, that's... that's what? Private property? Shall we read it? Please, don't. Hey. "Tell redwood "that I love him and that everything is going to be o... " he's been extracted! And when I win my green jacket, he's gonna come and get me. Shut up. And we're gonna take my mom and I'm gonna get my own room. I know the secret, you know? "Just let the dog out." The more I know, the better I'll do on 18... Because I'm down one on Jack, and it's the last hole, and it fits my fade perfectly. And then things are going to go back to the way they used to be. He's crazy, like gramps. What does "extracted" mean? Did you read the letter from the orange grove care home? He's not going. It's something we should think about. They're reasonable, and his pension would cover it. You asked me to think about it, I did. Honey. He needs more care than we can give him. Enough, jade. 'Kay? Well, on a positive note, I got a call from Ethan's lawyer today. Looks like we can go and see him soon. When? You're not taking him. What do you mean, I'm not taking him? I mean, you're not taking him. You're not going up there. That's it, there's no more discussion. I can see my dad if I want. What was that? Arnold, don't. No, I want to hear that again. I said, I can go see my father if I want to. Don't! Can I ask you a question? Of course, honey. Did you love dad? I was crazy about him. Then why did you leave? I had Josh and Todd with Arnold when we were young. We got together in high school, and he was pretty much the only guy I ever knew. And then he tried to enlist in the war in Vietnam, but he was denied because of what they called a mental disorder. He hadn't gotten over his brother's death. It was a really hard time for us. I was confused... With Arnold, with the war. I didn't want him to go, I didn't believe in the war the way that he did. And then I met your father. I was... Working at this diner and he came in one night... And... I don't know. He was like a different world to me, and I was comfortable with him. It all happened really fast. One minute, I was leaving Arnold and my two boys, and the next, I was... I never wanted to leave you, redwood. I just thought, at the time, that you had a better chance with your father than Josh and Todd had with theirs. It's okay, mom. Honey, I'll go first, okay? Yeah. Hi. Hi. Long time. Yeah, it's been a long time. I'll go get him. - Hey. Jade? - Yeah? Thanks for coming. Your turn, honey. Guess what? What? I was down one on Jack, on 18, but then Earl showed me the secret. He lives in the basement, you know. I mean, they feed him, but they think he's crazy, delusional, but don't tell anyone that I go down there, okay? Because he showed me how to let the dog out, and I think ruben and I are ready for Jack on 18. Promise? I promise. It sounds like you're doing all right, red. You're getting out soon, right? You know, red... It's not looking... good. Because I want to go home. Promise not to tell anyone that I go downstairs with Earl or sneak into the courses in the morning, okay? Not even mom. Okay. And dad? Yeah, red? Once I beat Jack and get that green jacket, things are going to get better, I promise. And maybe we can bring mom and Earl with us. I mean, Earl hasn't been out of the basement since Danny died in that hunting accident and... time's up, Hansen. All right. Red... I love you, man. I love you, too. Do me a big favor, okay? Okay. You take care of your mother. Jade, we got to figure this out. Don't. This will not happen again. He's a good kid. I know. I don't want to fuck this up. Hold this? Hey. Never... Touch my mother again. You put the gun down. Promise? Oh, shit. Redwood, please, put the gun down. Promise? - Put the freakin' gun down... - Jesus, red! - Arnold, don't! Never hurt my mother again! Promise? I promise. Say it! Listen to me! I promise. I will never hurt your mother again. My word. Okay? Okay. And one more thing? I would prefer it "redwood," please. Okay. Dad! Something's wrong with Hank! Shit. Hank! You okay? Yeah. You? Oh, yeah. Oh... See? That's what I'm talking about. Let the dog out, then grab his tail on the follow-through. Watch out, Jack. Earl... Once I beat Jack on 18, my dad's gonna get out of jail, and come and pick me and my mom up. Would you like to come with us? Life ain't that easy, kid. Like I said, it ain't that easy. What do you mean? It just ain't, that's all. You like it down here, don't you? Love/hate, more like it. But they think you're crazy. "Delusional," not crazy. Look, kid. I like you, but old men get... crusty. We frown at change. Well, my dad says that the Buddha says that life isn't permanent, and resisting the change causes internal turmoil. Never thought of it like that. He says the maharajah believes we're one and all, and it's your decision, your will, your life, your consciousness. Yeah, look where it got your dad, eh? Jail time, incarcerated. He's been extracted! And do you want to know what I think? Yes, I do want to know what you think. I think you're just afraid. You could be right. You made me think. I quit the pills. Really? Yeah. And I got to admit, made things a little clearer. In fact, I want you to do me a favor. Anything. Get rid of 'em for me. No comprende, under the bed. I told 'em every year, let's ride them bulls in Spain! Come on, dad, it's lunchtime. I'm ready to run with them bulls! They ain't so tough. The problem is them spaniards. They eat too much spicy food, just like Pete's friend, Walter, and that crazy monkey. Never seen a goddamned monkey shit that much. Sort of reminds me of that boy at the track. Sure could pick a winner, though! Dad, you... you never been to the track. You okay, dad? That little Buddha got me thinking. Life is changing... And I've gotten crusty. Feeling okay, dad? Dad? Never felt better. 18th hole at Augusta national. This is it, Scott. Well, Chuck, redwood seems poised, almost like he knows... The secret. Do you really think he's old enough to know the secret? Well, I think we're about to find out. Jack's made his approach on 18, and he is safely on the green. Redwood has a 5-iron, he's down one, and needs to hit it tight for a chance at birdie. He could hole it for the win, but I really think he should bare down and play it safe. Hansen is looking for his first magical green jacket that will change everything. Take a deep breath, red! In through your nose... Out through your mouth! In... Out. Focus. The secret. "The secret." Nice swing, red! It's right at it. My God, it looks... Pretty... - damn! - Great! It could go... In the hole...? He's won it! Yeah! Hah! Yes! A miracle from the fairway! Whoo-hoo! Redemption! We're saved! Redemption! Incredible! Wow! We did it! - Ho, ho! - We did it. Yes. Nice job, red. You deserve this. No, ruben. We deserve this. So, tell us, redwood, I mean, how does it feel? 11 years old, and already a champion. I mean, it feels great, Scott. I'd like to thank Jack nicklaus for giving it his all, but, most importantly, I'd like to say to everyone out there, that my dad is innocent on all charges, and he's gonna come get me and my mom now, and maybe even Earl could come with us. I mean, he lives in the basement, you know, but they think he's crazy... Delusional. Okay, redwood... Well, we wish you and your father all the best. After all, marijuana is just nature's cigarette. I love you, dad. We love you, dad. We love you, dad. We love you, dad. We love you, dad. We love you, dad. We love you, dad. We love you, dad. We love you, dad. I beat him. I beat Jack! I beat Jack! Mom! Mom, I beat him! I beat Jack! "Redwood, "I wish I could give you a big hug right now. "I wish I could change a lot of things "that I've done in my life. "However, sometimes, "these lessons come in strange packages "that take time to understand. "I'm sorry "that I might have hurt you by my actions. "They were never meant to harm you in any way. "I only wanted to protect you from the things I know, "which I now realize, "after sitting in this cell for what seems like forever, "to be impossible. "You are your own person, "you have your own gifts, "and you will grow and realize them on your own. "Having said that... "I write with news that breaks my heart to tell you..." No! Redwood? Are you all right? Yeah. I'm fine. I want to go visit my father. I think, uh... I think that'd be okay. We'll all go. Dad, honk! Just relax. We're gonna be late. Now, hold your horses, hard-ass. Holy shit! Give 'er a pull. Ruben and I he's found a new bag, and that's all right with me. Besides... I found a few new friends and I've realized, that when life calls for a draw and you hit a fade... Maybe it's time to take a step back, work on your game, and learn to hit a draw.
