When mom got sick, father ... ... decided that i should grow away from Italy. You and Me ... Grandma Rose took me away from Tuscany. I lived with her until she began forgeting things. faces, mixing up days and memories After that, she ended up in a hospital. and i in a boarding school. The Italians were fallen in love with my mother. But she thought it was a sign of destiny. to have enchanted British born father in the province of Arezzo. But grandma Rose couldn't stand him. Don't know why. How's school? Everything is fine. They wanted to know the reason for this trip in the middle of the school year though. And what did you tell them? that i was coming to see you. They understood. What about that friend of yours ... I met last time while coming to see you. Ricky ... Ricky, you're still in love with him? I hope not. Still enjoying New York? Yeah ...

Olga is my assistant ... who used to be a surgeon. Yes, i was a young girl, not much older than you. So did you know my mother? Eh ... Come on, let's go inside. We can talk there. Here we are. How old is this place? It's not as old as the White House in Washington D.C. Really? Not all buildings in Italy. Date back to the Roman Empire, you know? Oh, wow! Is that the Lake of Idols? Very good ... So are those the Etruscans? Lets say ... The artist imagined ... Etruscans celebrating rituals beside the lake. Human sacrifice. Nooo... They were an advanced sensitive civilization.

I guess, I'll just walk by myself. You're not going to have your tea then? I'll have some later. But you have to have some breakfast. I'm fine. Thank you. Your father prescribed these for you. Please take them. What are they? They are vitamins and supplements. He wants you to be strong and healthy. Every time dad came to visit me, he would take to me about the Lake of Idols. Since quiting his job, he has thrown himself ... passionately into the study of this archaeological site. and its secrets. He is so obsessed by the stories. And sometimes I would find them in my dreams. They aren't always pleasant. The Lake of Idols. and the leaves would transform from living death filitch from the floss. to the earth beneath. They decay and sudden flight from frost to floss whisper like the vanishing of a ghost. under the roots of sensitive plants, the moles and the dorma is died of want. A bird struck stiff from the frozen air and were caught in the branches naked and bare. Gosh! You scared me to death! Where did you come from? Sorry ... It's okay. You almost gave me a heart attack. Didn't mean to scare you. Does your mom know you're here? I live with other children. In a house at the hospital of sick people. Is it an orphanage? Have you runaway? I'm Jenny, by the way.

He had to remain in Arezzo, he'll be back tomorrow. He asked me to remind you to take your vitamins. Yes Dr.Brooks. But none have ever trembled and planted with bless. In the garden, felt all the wilderness. Like a dove in the noon tide with love sweet warmth. As a companioness sensitivel plant. I don't understand anything. Neither do i understand. You'll never understand anything. What a lovely voice you have Jenny. I can really smell those flowers. - Please read more? - No, enough! Tell us a story, a parrot story. With swords, fights, dead ... Okay I'll bring some more books next time and you Peter? What kind of stories do you like? He likes love stories. No,only ghost and you like those. Oh shut sisy.

Those where horses and spears. Yes, I think. What's that cry? We are all sick here. Dad! Tonight we're gonna have a really really special dinner. Because I want you to forgive me. For breaking my promise. I told you we were going to Lake together. But I'm glad you find your own way. Good evening doctor. Is all well? Everything as planned. That's the fish for supper and I'm taking Jenny to Arezzo tomorrow . Oh finally! What time should we leave? Bright and early? That's not necessary. The only thing is tomorrow don't have breakfast here. and I'll take you to a fantastic cafe in Arezzo. Where they make the best cappuccino in Tuscany. It's a Good thing you're taking me out tomorrow dad. I was beginning to feel like a statue. Be careful ... This statue is very, very old. and very, very fragile. Sorry ... How old is it? Between 2600 and 3000 years. The Etruscans had already developed extremely refined and spiritual civilization. They believed that the part of human existence ... continued ... after death. which would endure thousands of years, is always was much more important ... than the few fleeting years ... of mortal existence. This is why they devoted far more attention for the well being and the dwelling of the dead than those of the living. Do you understand? Yeah! So ... Was The Lake of Idols a burrials place? No, no, The Lake was life giving the lake cured the diseases. The Etruscans believed that these waters ... had special thereaputic properties. They conducted rituals in which they threw small bronze concentrated objects in to the lake, representing sick persons or the parts of the body that needed to be healed. and did it work? That's what I've been trying to find out. For the last 20 years. Jenny ... Can you wait for me here? Why? Where are you going? Just around the corner to a shop I'll be back in 10 minutes, allright? It's better we speak English. So my wife don't understand. I'm fighting for a divorce. It is taking my sales. Poor fool ... She does not know that everything is ready to put her away. She'll finish her days in a clinic ... What must i create for you this time. - The same material? - Same material, same technique. How much would you take? Do you mean money? Or time? Time ... You are not Doctor ... The .... art is like surgery. one never knows for sure how long the operation will last. Even more, if one uses techniques. That are lost in time. takes a steady hand. I'll call as soon as it is ready. Okay ...what now? Home. Darling have to go. No, Dad! Let's go do something. No, I've got important work to do. Come on! I'll let you know whats the matter? If it were up to you, I would've stayed at home getting bored all day! There is no one here my age. Luckily I met those children. Which children? You didn't tell me you're meeting any children. Thye were all sick and strange. But they're nice. I like them. Where did you meet'em? In the hospital? Do you want to be a doctor like daddy? No! I'm sick and tired of this trip. I should've stayed at school. The fearful passage, of their death marked love and the continuous of their parents rage. which with their children end not could remove. is now the two hours traffic of our stage. So ... Do you see what Shakespeare's doing? From the very first line, he is telling us how this story will end. Where civil blood makes forehands so clean. Romeo and Juliet Boring you already? You must take her upstairs Peter. We must be sure ... Sure of what? I know. So then, What are we waiting for? It's still too early. Could you be able to stay here? Untill it's dark? or do you have to go home? Okay ... Why have you brought me here? are you scared of me? Should I be? Maybe I'm evil ... Peter, please ... This place gives me the creeps. I can feel a sense of horror. Horror..? Is nothing but the truth. Who drew this? Someone ... Who's that girl? ... If you really want to know. Come to the Lake. - should behave ... - Still not ready . - right! - You can't do it! is on that side ... How do we do this time? - I do not know! - We can't start off again ! No we can't, It's not possible. You got to do something James, Please think of something. Yes, yes, yes. We will ... Dad? Can't you hear me? I'm so thirsty daddy, give me some water. I can't speak. I'm so glad you're here with me. Dad? I'm here sweetheart. Every thing is all right. - What happened? - You had a little operation. Just a simple one. And everything went perfectly. Tomorrow ... you will recover and i'll take you home. What did they operate? You had an infection in a adrenal gland ... Nothing serious. I don't remember anything. Not even how i got here. You fainted. We brought you here in an ambulance. But now, you're absolutely fine. I want to stay here. Will you take me home? You will be discharged tomorrow after your last medication. NO... I want to go home. Can you give me more medication? If you prefer ... I can arrange it. and I tell them to give you a sedative. So you won't feel the journey in the ambulance. Thank you ... Where is my Mom's ring? removed it for the surgery. Here it is ... If you want, put on. Thank you Dad. I was beginning to get hungry ... That's a good sign. There you go Darling. Thank you Olga. You're looking well Jenny. If you need anything, let me know. Thank you. It's true, you're looking well. You're got excellent power's of recovery. Did you take after me ... Mom wasn't like that? Oh yes, she was amazingly healthy. Until,the disease struck her down. Why do you never talk about her? I would like to go visit her at the cemetery. Will you take me? Brooks ... Thank you Mr. Sabelli. I'll come and collect it later today. When was the last time you came to visit? A while ago.

Why do we have to come here at night? Because some things are possible only at night. How is he doing that? I do not know. Only he knows how to. What ... or who were those? They are the souls of the Lake. Souls? - Dead? - Pretty dead. They're almost three thousand years old. Okay ... I'm frightened Can we please go home? I'm younger than you are. and I'm not scared. They need our help. Someone stole their statues from the lake. They want them back. thats why they're asking for our help. Watch out dad! STOP!. - Dad! - What is it? you alright. Finish it off. It's finished, relax. Relax. That's better, relax. It's just a dream. I keep about dreaming of the Lake. Those statues. Which statues? One's I saw in the photos in your car ... when we nearly ran over the little boy. I must see them. You have them, don't you? I must see them. Alright. Now just rest. Just rest. Rest. Good morning Jenny, did you sleep well? so so. Eat something, you'll feel much better. Where is my father? He's in his study. - I'll go see him. -He doesn't want to be distrubed. I won't disturb him, I'm his daughter. When the door is closed. He doesn't wish to be disturbed Lately. Why is he always locking himself in? You have the key too, right? All of his archaeological finds are there plus 20 years of research. It's natural he want's to protect himself against thieves. I am not a thief. Eat your breakfast Jenny. Don't worry, you're not my mother. Jenny? Do not close the door, promised Lake statues show. It wasn't a promise. Come on Dad, you said! Jenny!

I will read more next time. Jenny, is everything alright? It's just ... I can't find those statues. The door to my father's studio is always locked. You must find them, Jenny. We have to give them back to the souls of the Lake. Jenny, you've got to check if the statues are still there. You must do it Jenny. This dummy is right. - You're the dummy. - You must find a way to get in. I know a way to get in. Jenny? Olga and I have to go to Arezzo, Do you want to come? No dad, I'm tired. That's alright. We'll bring you something nice for supper, what would you like? You decide. Okay, I got something in mind. Hope you like it. Won't The Souls of Lake be happy. They have been wanting them for such a long time. Yes. Such a long time. It was 20 years for them? They have been under Lake for over 3000 years. When you lose something you care for Even a single day is an eternity. Aurora's right. Aurora is right. Anyhow Jenny was ... successfull and now ... We'll go to the lake. Great work Jenny. Well done. Good job Jenny. What do we do? You'll have to give them back. - How? - Like the Etruscans did. Throw them in the center of the Lake. Do you want to throw one? No, you have to do it. Who are you?

But first Jenny, tell me something ... Where are the idols? What idols? Dad. Why didn't you tell me about her? Her name is Maya. She was born four years ... ... before you. You can't explain everything. She has to understand. Jenny ... Olga, has always been love of my life. Maya is the only child we were able to have Her Birth.. So many things changed for us. She became center of our existence. In a few years she began to Suffer from strange ailments. We took her to all the best specialists. And, the prognosis left no room for hope. Progressive myositis Oscificance. What? The so-called "stoned man disease". Over time, transformed muscles and tendons ... And certain organs to bone. Condemning the patient ... inevitable to death. Something had to be done and i decided to exterminate myself. The only possibility ... was to substitute the organs when the symptoms of the disease appear. We have dedicated ourselves ... to keeping her alive. and we have succeeded. Locked up in a room? What kind of life is that? Maya ... She has everything she wants here. The love and care ... of a mother and a father. ... infection in a endocrine gland ... Nothing serious. I do not remember anything. you fainted. We brought here in an ambulance. What have you done to me? You gave your sister a great gift. You gave her one of my kidneys. Try and understand. You ... You have donated, the possibility of survival ... to Maya ... - I did not "donate" anything. - You stole it from me. - Otherwise ... my daughter ... ... would be dead. You ... have given her a life. You are completely mad! Jenny ... Jenny ... You're just like your mother. She wasn't capable of understaing. What did you do to her? Your mother was ... A young, strong and healthy woman. came to the hospital for a checkup. What did you do to her? I impergnated her. And you were born. After ... I decided to send to your grandmother, you had to grow up far from here. I knew that one day ... Maya, will need you. Your life gives life, you are healthy as your mother was. You're genetically compatible with Maya. Why should you not want to save her? The ancient Etruscans ... had ... a very advanced knowledge. I followed their rituals. I reproduced your kidney bronze and gave it to the Lake. I've used the lakes powers ... ... to help save Maya. Lake, is salvation. The Lake is life. You, you are perfectly designed to save Maya. Your life to save her life. Your life to save her life. Maya just said that this has ... been the most wonderful day of her life. She is so happy to have a sister. James perhaps we should reconsider everything! I mean ... Let her lead a normal life for just a little while. - Perhaps Jenny can help ... - Olga ... It's too late. -It's out of the question. Do not worry Jenny. Every thing is alright. Maya ... needs you again. I'm gonna have to operate. And after that ... You won't feel any more pain. Jenny. Jenny, wake up. Jenny. Jenny, wake up. You must listen to me Jenny. Peter. Go away. My father is evil. Listen to me. You must go to the lake bottom. Retrieves all the bronze objects your father left over the years. All together. There are six. You'll recognize them immediately. Take them all. Bring them back to the room. with a locked door in the childrens home, you understand? Yes. How many bronzes are there? Six. Okay. But why? Why remove them of the Lake? Trust the power of the Lake. For love, beauty and delight. There is no death, no change ... that might exceed your organs. No change or no light. Being themselves obscure. Please, please, please, please! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Jenny. Jenny! Try not to let the adults see you. they are bad. We are all sick here. Jenny Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! NO! Maya! Jenny. Go back Jenny . you have bring the other, quickly. Your father is coming. You have to ... Give it to me! It must be left in the water. Maya. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ... No! Oh my goodness! A sensitive plant. Like one forbid. And the tears within each letter ... as folded leaves growing together. light was changed, by an icy blue. But the leaves soon fell. and branches sawn by the heavy axe. shrank through the root of every wall. as blood in the heart will be no more. please help! No!No please! ... as kids do ... What a lovely voice you have Jenny. But only the tragic end. Peter We are all sick here. Try that adults do not see. are bad. Jenny? Do you see them too mom? They are your brothers and sisters. Wheather, the sensitive plant ... or that which within bows as the spirit is out. outward form of no decay. Now felt this change ... I can not say. Wheather that lady's gentle mind ... no longer with the forms combined. which scattred love, as stars do light. And the sadness left aside. I dare not guess. But in this life ignorance and stride. Where nothing is, but all things seem. As we, the shadows ... ... of the dream Lake Idols It is an important site ... ... archaeological close Arezzo, in Tuscany. Numbers small human figures ... ... and parts of anatomy Human bronze ... ... produced by the Etruscans, were found there. are preserved in the Museums ... ... more important around the world.
