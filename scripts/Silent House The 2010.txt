We should begin by fixing the backyard and then continue our way to the front of the house. - What are you doing? - Nothing. I'm just looking around. - Wilson, how are you? - Good, good, good... - Excuse the delay please. - It's completely fine. I didn't see you for a long time. Like I told you on the phone, I want to sell the house. But I would like to fix the house a little bit to make it look nicer. Have you seen the house yet? Yes. I was speaking about it with my daughter. We decided to wake up very early and work the whole day. - Good. I got some water and blankets. - Laura! - And what do you think about the town? - Ah well, it's all the same. Nothing has changed. Yes. One realizes how fast time passed by looking at the kids. So... Are you sure you're going to sell the house? Yes. I live in the city now and well... My brother and I are selling our properties in the area. So we won't see you around again? I come back time to time. It's all the memories I have, you know... - Did you have to wait for me a long time? - No no no, we just got here. Alright then. Let's go inside. Here is another lantern Laura. Wilson, came with me. The place looks worse than I thought. And it's even worse upstairs. There are loose tiles and it's dangerous. I will have to ask you not to go upstairs. Let's go this way. Come on, Wilson. We have some candles here. - Here are some chairs Wilson. Will you manage? - Yes, without a problem. We'll manage just fine. We always find a way to be comfortable so don't worry. How long do you think it will take more or less? I calculate we will need one or two days If the weather holds. We thought to start working from the back of the house with the grass, then we should clean up the house. And finally we should finish the front of the house. - What do you think, sounds good to you? - Yes, sounds fine. If you like it that way. - Yes I think this will be our plan. - By the way... Come and see. This door here. It's very useful if you need to access the front area of the house. I see, perfect. Alright. I trust you so I'll leave you the keys here and I'll bring you two something to eat later. - No it's alright, you don't have to worry. - It's a pleasure, I'm very happy to see you both. Let me accompany you. - So do you have a buyer for the house already? - Yes, now it's just a matter of some weeks. Negotiations have already been going on for a while. Laura, let's get ready. - Father! Father! ... Father! - Hmmm... - Did you hear that? - What? Those sounds. - What sounds? - There is someone outside. There is no one out there, Laura. Just go to sleep... Father... Father! Wake up. Father... Did you hear that? - What... - I can hear those sounds again. From the first floor. Let's see Laura... We will do one thing now. I will walk upstairs and take a look. But when I come downstairs again, I want to see you sleeping. Alright? Father? Father? Father?! Father! Father! What happened to you? Wake up, Father. You need to wake up... What have they done to you... The keys... The keys... Father...! Father...! What happened?! Calm down. Calm down. Who did this? What happened to you? What happened? Relax... Relax... Relax... Now tell me what happened. Just tell me what happened. - Someone attacked us. - Who attacked you? I do not know. I don't know. - No!! I don't want to go! I don't want to go! - Stop it. Stop it! Please relax. Calm down! - I'm goin to check. - No! No I don't want to go! - Where is your father? Where is he? - I do not know. I don't know... - We must look for him. Relax. - I don't want to go back... I don't want to go back... No... No don't go there. Don't go there. - Wait here, I'll go inside and take a look. - No... Don't go... Don't go there... - Come. You have to come with me, come on. - No! I don't want to go! No... - It's dangerous if you stay here, there is nothing there. Nobody. No one. - No... No I don't want to go... There is nobody in the house. Nobody. Come on. Come on. Did you move the furniture? - Nestor. Nestor! - Stay there! Wilson! Nothing. Laura... Where is your father? I do not know. Where did they attack you? On the first floor. You went upstairs? Wilson! Wilson! Relax... Hold on. Wait here. Wilson! Where is he Laura? I told you not to go upstairs. Wilson! Why did you go upstairs Laura? Father. Father... He is not here. He is not here, Laura. It's been a long time since anyone has come up here. Let's go, Laura. He is not here. Nestor? Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! What have they done to you... Nestor! Are you all right? What happened? Who attacked you. Look at me. Nestor... What is happening in this house? Why, Laura? Why? I saw the photos... - What photos? - The photographs! - What are you talking about? - The photos in your room! The photographs! What are you saying, Laura? Do you miss her? - Miss who? - Her. - Who? - Our daughter. Do you miss her? - You can tell her. She is right here. - I miss you. Liar! Do you love me? Do you? Yes? Why didn't you come? I was waiting for you... I am here with you now. I'm here now... Help me... Be quiet! Laura... I called your father because I wanted to see you. That's why I called. - I needed to see you. - Shut up! - Don't you remember? - Shut up! - Do you remember... we agreed to discuss it. - Be quiet! - Remember, remember... - Be quiet! You knew we could not keep her. - What did you do to your father? Did you kill him, Laura? - Shut up! Be quiet! - Keep your mouth shut! Shut up!! - He knew it was the best... It was for the best. - Shut up!! Shut up!! - Listen to me. Listen to me. Keep as your mouth shut!! Quiet!! You lied to me. He lied to me like you did. You murdered my baby! You will die like my father. Smile. Smile. Six days later the police found the mutilated bodies along with some disturbing photographs. Despite the overwelming evidence it wasn't possible to finish the investigation. Eight months later the case was completely closed. Laura was never found. Sophie! Sophie! How's my little girl! You look beautiful! - Were you playing? - Yes. - Do you want to visit your grandmother? - Yes. It's been such a long long time since we've seen her. We can ride a horse. And drink a cup of hot milk. Let's go this way here. It will be perfect, we will go swimming. Would you like to go swimming? Because you see, grandma has a canoe. It's a very small boat. Do you know what a canoe? No? It's a boat, but it's really tiny. And only three people can sit in it. You, your grandmother and me. And also the doll. Did you know that grandmother wants to meet you very much? But she lives very far away... And we must walk and walk. Walk very far. And over there... We will be able to see... We'll be able to see a lot of sunshine. Out in the countryside. Does it hurt? No? Do you like it or don't you want to walk further? Sophie, I love you very much. Did you know that there is a tree with a house in it? When I was a child I used to play there. I was going every day. You can also go and play there. It's near a lake...
