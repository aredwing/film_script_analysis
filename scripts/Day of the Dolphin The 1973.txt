That you are able to see ... ...to perceive, with every part of your being. seeing, hearing, taste, smell ... ...and every inch of your surface, your skin, ... is a receptor. A continuous source of perfectly accurate information about the world for miles around. Imagine ... ... That you are able to carry on simultaneous conversations with two members of your species, one right next to you, and the other several miles away. Listen to the language ... ...intricate patterns of clicks, whistles, squeaks and groans. Sounds, subtle enough to convey complicated factual data, Complex enough, perhaps to deal with... abstractions, ...what we would call, ideas. His brain... ...is a big as a man's. It processes information about two worlds. The world of water where it is born and feeds, and reproduces, and dies... ... and the world of air, in which he breathes. He has few natural enemies. Shark, Barracuda ... ...the fisherman who doesn't care what he catches, and certain, clumsy scientists... ... who believe that the easiest path to an animals brain is made with a scalpel. As tragic and senseless as that kind of death can be ... ...so is his birth a moment of inspiration. Thats why I thought I would close my report to you today... ... with this piece of film, which shows our first dolphin, born in captivity. His tail comes out first ... That's so his spiracle, thats the hole on top of his head, from which he breathes, ...can come out last. Then rushes to the surface to the air. Watch closely, because, this happens rather quickly. There. Well, that was Alpha's birth. He's now almost 4 years old... ...and we think he is very bright. That's all, unless there are any questions. Doctor Terrell ... Did you say Alpha? Yes we call him Alpha, because he's the first, the first dolphin born at the center. Its a little bit pretentious perhaps, but rather than spot, or rover, actually, we call him Fa. Is the Alpha still with his mother? No, ah, Alpha's mother died shortly after giving birth... ... We don't know why. We raised him ourselves. My wife and associate, Margaret Anderson and I, have spent the major part of the last 4 years... living with him, feeding him, teaching him. Teaching him what? Well we are concentrating on certain experiments, Trying to learn certain things from Alpha, Things that have to do with, oh, measurements, and intelligence, and so forth. Doctor Terrell ... ... is it possible ... I mean like I read somewhere... ... that the dolphins are as intelligent, as we are? Well it depends on your definition of intelligence. His brain contains a sonar system that's amazingly sophisticated. For instance it enables him to distinguish... ...from enormous distances, between objects of fractionally different sizes, Or between, different kinds of metal, ...or between organic, and inert matter. Dr. Terrell... ...what about the experiments of the military... I don't know anything about military. But certainly you've heard about the misuse of animals like dolphins that the government... Just a moment please. I'm not a political scientist ... My degrees are in biology, and zoology and behavioral psychology ... ... government and I pay very little attention to each other. Well, doctor, what is it, exactly, that you hope to learn from all these studies? I mean what can a dolphin teach us? We are trying to learn ... ... about how his sonar works about the functions of his language, ... about how he manages to maneuver with such speed and dexterity, most of all wed like to know why... ... after millions of years as a land animal... this species was compelled, or or ... decided to return to the sea. Um, what about their speaking, in English? I beg your pardon? I saw this dolphin on television and he counted from one to eight in English. Really? I didn't see it. What do you suppose it was? Was it some of trick or something? Yeah, yeah I'd say, Yes, just a trick. Harold, I'm afraid we're gonna have to skip this drink. I've got to get back to the island right away. Nothing wrong I hope. No nothing that can't be fixed. Is there anything I can do to help? Yes, you could ah, get the foundation to pay those bills at Key Largo for me. I need that new equipment right away. -Jake I have to talk to you about it. Thank you so much, that was absolutely fascinating. thank you... as I was saying I'd like to talk about some of those bills. Your getting weekly reports aren't you? Nobody's complaining. It's just that we are wondering about all the new recording equipment. wondering what? What are you using it for. Recording, excuse me... I see. Harold, we're recording the sounds the dolphins are making. And trying to develop a highly complicated feedback system. Look are we going over the budget? Yes you are. Oh, then we'll try to be more careful. Thank you. That your car? Yes. Drop me off at the marina will you? Jake that's 30 miles in the wrong direction. direction. -Tell him to drive fast. I'm in a hurry. Drive fast, he's in a hurry. Jake ... ... thanks for giving the speech. Anything for the Franklin foundation. It's all in neighborhood public relations. Yeah, now you owe me a favor. Name it. Pay those bills. Lets get out of here! That's what I had in mind. What happened, do you know? No I was picking up the new equipment at Key Largo. David called me, ... ... told me to come over and get you and bring you back. - Damn. Oh, don't worry, Maggie's tough. - What? - I said, Margret is tough, she can take it. Oh, I know, I was, I was worried about alpha. Oh, yeah. - Wake me up before we get there. Right. What did he say about her? About who? Maggie? He said she was alright. She's fine Jake, Mary Ann is up at the house. whos in there, Larry? No, Larry is up at the house too. Who's with Alpha? No one right now. Well we thought that... thought what? Everything stops just because someone has a little accident? Whats the matter with you. Well I thought, under the circumstances... There are no circumstance, there's to be someone with him always. Always. Whether he's in the tank, or the dry room, or the control room. Continuous monitoring... ... no exceptions! OK? Jake ... Jake ... you coming? Ah ha. I go away for one lousy afternoon the whole place falls apart. Doesn't anybody have anything to do? Come on Larry. Don't blame Maggie, Jake, it wasn't her fault. I didn't say it was. I'll be down at the tank if you need me. Jake I'm really sorry. I panicked, I was so scared I just forgot everything. He wasn't trying to hurt me. He just wanted me to stay in the water with him. Was he excited? That's what, the third time this week, huh? Getting jealous? Don't be a wise guy, I'll bite your other leg. Go on Jake, go ahead. I'll be alright. He's growing up Jake. - Yeah. I think maybe his, "Ma and Pa" aren't enough for him anymore. Listen, I want you guys to put an intercom between here and my house, okay? Sure. You all eaten? Go ahead I'll stay. There's some terrible calking down in tank three. That must be cracking... Pa-a-a-a. Well, Fa. You've had quite a day haven't you. Pa-a-a-a. You seem to have some very impressive credentials here Mr. Mahoney. Yes I seem to. I don't quite understand what it is you want of me? I want to visit Jacob Terrell's marine biology center. Why? I'm interested in the work he's doing. As you see I am a writer ... I'm thinking of doing a series of articles on marine research. For whom? Oh, that's not established. There are a number markets. Why don't you contact Dr. Terrell himself? You know that I already have. What do you mean? And that he said "no" ... ...and that it's taken me several weeks to push my way into your office ... so that you can do me this very small favor. The fact is Dr. Terrell does not want visitors, strangers, at the center. Why? Is he hiding something? No, of course not. He is scared someone's going to run off with that good looking little girl he's married to. I don't think that's a particularly nice thing to say Mr. Mahoney. Forgive me please. I have a terrible habit of making thoughtless statements. I'm dangerously unrefined. Dangerous eh? Look, let's leave it at this... I'll take these, and I'll leave this with you. It's sort of a first draft of an article I was considering. You'll find it interesting. It's about the Franklin Foundation. I'd really prefer doing something along the lines we were discussing, but you read it and see what you think. Are you a blackmailer Mr. Mahoney? Good lord no. I'm just an average guy... ... With an above average curiosity. Of course I makes friends easily. Yes, I see that. That's why I have access to a lot of files, information, public, and private, all kinds of sources. Listen, when we get to know each other better I tell you some things about yourself that will simply astound you. No, Fa... - Good boy, come on. - What. - No, no, no, no. ha-a-a, ha-a-a. - Come on Fa. - Good. - No, not good. - Fish, Fa want fish? - Yes. - Well, Pa give fish. Fa say Hand. Arahhhh! Alfa, I'm deeply disappointed in you this morning. You really a pain in the ass. Ass! Jake! Jake, can you hear me? Maggie? That's right. How's it going? I'm thinking of selling him and getting myself a parrot. Jake we have a visitor. I'll be right down. Pa-a-a? No! You can't say a simple word like hand. Hand ... Beautiful, simply beautiful. Its like being in another world. - What's the problem Harry? You can't accept the possibility that I just wanted to drop in? Drop in? See how you were getting along? No. You know Jake ... the foundation subsidizes, fully and partially, an extraordinarily eclectic group of... ... scientists, artists, writers, 2 medical research centers, a library, a yearly international students conference... Am I boring you? Oh I'm sorry. It just the beer. The point is Jake we're sincerely interested in the work of all these people. We like to think it's a co-operative venture. Yeah? It's not a charity! Of course not. Basically, it one gigantic tax write off. That's a little joke Harold, don't take it seriously. The Board of Directors of the Franklin Foundation ... ... is considering withdrawing its support for the Terrell Marine Center. They are what ... ? Let's take a little walk. What are you doing in there? In where? The figures taken from your monthly report seem to indicate that you put about $200,000 dollars into that building! It's all itemized under the care and feeding of one, count them, one male dolphin, ... Alpha, age 4. - 200,000? - What does he eat, caviar? Jake I can't justify that kind of expenses to the board... ... because I don't know myself what you're doing in there. David ... Would you like to sit down Harold? What do you know about, linguistics, semantics, phonetics? Very little. Here goes lesson number one. The first month, first year. Alfa speaks, in his own language. The sounds are coming from his spiracle, not from his mouth. The second month, second year. from the squeaks, and the whistles and the groans. The seventh month, second year. Our first phoneme "a". Ninth month, second year. More phonemes the atoms of speech. The second month, third year. Fourth month, third year. From vowels to consonants. Sixth month, third year. Tenth month, third year. He's learning faster now. second month, fourth year. Here comes our first morpheme. Phoneme "P", plus phoneme "A", equals, "PA" This one is ah, sort of a collection, made in the past few months. We call it our "Top 50". Ball... Swim... "Eat now" ... ... "Man." Coat..., Car... Friend..., Girl... "Love" ... "One" ... "Two" ... ... "Three" ... "Four" ... ... "Five" ... ... "Six" ... "Seven" ... ... "Eight" ... ... "Nine" ... "Ten." Alpha has been regressing a little in the past few weeks, so we're going to give him a companion, of his own species of course. ... Beta. Let's go. - Where does Beta come from? Oh, we caught her off the Florida keys a couple months ago, "watch her tail". What are we gonna call her for short, Jake, Ta? Fa, Ta, Ma and Pa, terrific. I think we better try "Bee". Bee for Beta. Ok Bee... and here we go. - What exactly do you think will happen? - We hope they will find each other sexually attractive. And if they do? Then Alpha will happier, and if he's happier he'll learn faster. In other words your offering him a bribe in the form of sex. Beats the hell out of Butter fish. Harold, would you like to watch through the window with Maggie. Is the hydrophone on? ah yeah. Start the tape. Okay. Wait till she breathes. Now! Two PM ... Alpha and Beta say hello. - Now I understand. Well I don't want any of this getting out. That's the important thing. All I've got so far is a dolphin imitating human speech sounds and... ... responding to certain verbal signals, but if it gets out... It's bound to be misinterpreted. They're gonna say it's... Terrell's down here carrying on conversations with a bunch of fish, and the whole thing is going to turn into a circus. My report will be completely confidential. I'll back you up all the way. Thanks. There is one favor you could do for me. Sure... There's a man I know, an old friend of mine, his name is Curtis Mahoney. What do you want..., Fa? Fish? say it, ... fish. Fa wants fish now? He's not going to say anything. Yeah. It's been what, two weeks? - Fifteen days. - Why? Well Honey if I knew that, then I'd know what the hell to do about it wouldn't I. I'm Sorry. - It's alright. I'll tell you what I think it is. I figure he's learning his own language, from Beta. Must be a great relief. Fish for Bee? Come on Fa, come on. Say "fish." Say "Ma" Come on ... Fa say something. Come on Fa. You know how. Oh, alright here take it. Ok Bee. Good girl. Come on. It's love alright. How much longer? - What? How much longer? Ah it's hard to tell. Guess. could be an hour. -oh Christ-. Feeling a little sick? "A little" isn't exactly the right word. There's a bunk down below. - How often you make this run? Now and then. You work with the dolphins too? Sometimes. - How many of you are there? - What? Working at the center, how many? Oh, few, I guess. Thats pinning it down alright. Terrell tell you not to talk to me? - What? - Did he tell you not to give me information? Hang on Mr. Mahoney we're going to hits some swells. Is the um, water circulating in the holding tank? - Yeah. He's been down there almost all day Maggie. U-hum. You want to argue with me about it? No thanks. He says he wants Alpha and Beta to know that what's going to happen is his game. - I know... Jake! The boats coming in. Ah nuts, I told Mike to take the long way. Hey! Fa, give now! Okay, listen you guys take Alpha and Beta, and put them in the holding tank. I'm coming out. Okay, You won't be laughing long pal. Ah, gonna have to put these away. Take it easy Mr. Mahoney. I don't get it. We're supposed to be keeping all this Alpha stuff a secret. And this guy comes to write something about it. What's the point? Well, he's supposed to be a friend of someone at the foundation. Anyway we're keeping him from seeing these two, that's all. He be gone tomorrow. Let me help you with this. Thanks, I can do it. I still got few ounces of strength left. Was the trip over a little rough? No, no, it was delightful. I particularly enjoyed the part where I threw up. What's that building? Well we're trying to build a special tank for some experiments. Sounds interesting. No more so than anything else, that's ah, nothing special. A special kind of tank for nothing special. I can hardly wait to see inside. What magazines do you write for Mr. Mahoney? Anyone that will accept my material. - How long have you known Harold DeMilo? Oh, quite a while. Did you know him at Harvard. I think he went to Princeton. Oh yeah, Princeton that right. Well I thought you might want to get some rest, maybe have something to eat... ... then we'll have one of the boys show you around. - You know what I would really like to do? - What? I've really been looking forward to seeing that dolphin of yours. You know, what's his name, Alpha? You know, the one that was born here. Isn't that his name, Alpha? Yes that's his name. I'd really love to take a look at him. He's right behind you. What's he saying? Your guess is as good as mine. Who's is he Jake? Whats the difference He won't be here long enough to give us any trouble. What kind of trouble? Whatever kind of trouble you had in mind. Well, you know he's not here to write an article about dolphins. No, I don't know that. Oh come on . Come on yourself. He lying about being a friend of Harold DeMilo. I don't think he even knows him. That sort of makes Harold a liar too doesn't it? That doesn't come as any great shock to me. You just don't trust the good old establishment do you? Which good old establishment. Leave it alone Maggie. Well don't you even want to know what... ...leave it alone. Let Mr. Mahoney do his job whatever that is and... get out... ...and we'll go on about our business. We'll probably be ready in a month or so... ... and then we can move one of the dolphins in and... really concentrate on them. Which one are you going to put in. No special one. Uhum. He likes you. What? Alpha, he likes you, I said. Oh he likes everybody. Everybody likes him too. Not everybody. What? That piece missing from his fin. It looks like somebody chewed it off. Oh a shark did that probably. A shark out in the ocean? He did that when he was a baby. He jumped out of the pool. Fell on his back. The fin got infected, we had to take a piece out. - That was before Lana got here. - That's right, that was before I got here. Well thanks for the tour. My pleasure. Jake ... Are you awake? Jake? Jake sleeps, what is it? Maggie, someone just tried to open the door. Where is he now? Well, it sounded like he went away. The telephone number on the card, you can reach me there if you ever need to. I'm not sure what it is you have in mind... You will when the time comes. - Goodbye Mrs. Terrell. - Goodbye, Mr. Mahoney. We are all on the same side you know. He knows something's up. What is it Fa? What does Fa want? Jake he's going to try to jump over. He can't run... Jesus... it'll hold. Will Alpha? Alright, uh... leave us alone. Fa ... do ... Bee ... - Fa? Fa... do... Bee ... Fa? Fa... want...Bee ... now. - Yeah ... Fa ... do... now ... - Yes, Fa wants Bee? - now... Fa... Bee... now... Bee... now. Maggie ... Maggie ... Maggie! How's it look? It's okay. A section came loose from one of the pipes. I re-attached it. Does it look like anything's been at it? No... I don't think so. You mean like a shark? yeah. Do you think they could handle one if it got in? I don't know... I don't think it's worth a chance to try it. What would they do? Well, they could always yell for help. - Man, it's weird. Think so? You don't? I mean I stand there and watch you talking to them... and listening... I know its happening, but its weird. Its like we're all having a dream, or some sort of... psychotic fantasy. Don't you feel something like that? Well I'll tell yeah ... ... since Alpha started speaking I've had a feeling... ... I haven't had since I was your age. What's that? That there are infinite... possibilities. Jake ... it's the Foundation ... Mr. De Milo. Maggie and I talked about this thing, we both feel that all of you should know as much as we do about it. So here's what's happened... It seems Mr. Mahoney, knows about Alpha and Beta. How much about em? All about them. And apparently he's ready to publish all his information on the work we've been doing here. How in hell did he find out? We don't know. ...but you can imagine how... ...disappointed the people at the foundation are that we kept them in the dark too. Oh boy... the point is it looks like we are going to be forced to come out with the information first... ...to keep this whole thing to keep from turning into some kind of freak show. that's exactly what I didn't want to have happen. I had hoped we had more time. ...but, (we don't) we don't. They're sneaking up on us. - Jake, it's not that bad. It's not that good. The world has to find out about this sooner or later, thats all part of it. What's all this work been for? I don't know any longer.... Jesus you're acting like a baby. Oh you don't understand. The hell I don't understand. You're just pissed off because the world is coming in here and interfering with your little kingdom... ... all those people who carry whatever disease you think the outside world has. It is a disease. Well I hope you're not the only doctor around when the epidemic hits. It's a disease, and it can kill Alpha and Beta. And how's it going to do that? By turning them into valuable properties. And putting their pictures on T-shirts and cereal boxes... ... by signing them up with record companies, naming a restaurant chain after them, Christ, I don't know... They'll end up with a high priced agent, and a salt water swimming pool in Beverly Hills. Jake ... if they're going to be exploited whose responsible. You taught them a language. Why? To become like you? Maybe I was wrong. It's a hell of a time to come to that conclusion. We should have become like them. Like what? Like what they are. Instinct, and energy. Then let them go. Send them back to the sea. I'm afraid it's too late. They wouldn't know what to do or where to go. We've changed them. I'll be back in a little while. I wonder if we can hear that again Dr. Terrell. yeah sure... Fa, say again. Man is good. Why does he believe that, do you suppose? Man is good. Ask him. May I? Fa... Fa. Why is man good? Smooth. I didn't get that I'm afraid. Smooth. He says we're smooth as he is. He likes the way we feel. Ah so, it is less a philosophical judgment, than a physiological one. Well, to Alpha smoothness is pleasure, and pleasure is good... I think that's a reasonable beginning for a philosophy don't you? Isn't a shark also smooth. Does that make him good? What about sharks? What do he say? I'm afraid he doesn't understand what you are saying. Your accent makes it difficult for him. Fa... Fa. Is a shark good? You have to understand that Alfa has never seen a shark. Beta undoubtedly has. I'm sorry. - Fa, here now. Let me see whether I can clear this thing up. To some, the Hypothesis, that a shark... Ah, excuse me sir, but you're using words that aren't in their vocabulary. They wouldn't understand the hypothetical. As far as they are concerned a thing either is or it isn't, there are no if's. All right. Let's try it this way. Fa ... Fa. Now... There is a shark in this tank. Son of a bitch ... I told you there's no hypothetical... Jake! Fa ... ... Fa, bring Bee here now. Wait a minute Mike. Let's see if Alpha will do it. Good Fa, good. - No sharks. - No sharks. - No sharks. Man said things not. What ah, what is it, what does that mean? - He calling you a liar. He is, is he? Well that's what he said. I'm being called a liar by a goddamn fish? There's always a first time, and he's not a fish, he's a mammal. You seem to be having trouble understanding what I've been telling you. I'm going to make this simple as I possibly can. Don't say anything more okay? Are you telling me to.... I'm telling you to shut up. Ben! Sit down. Why didn't the sonar of the dolphins tell him that there was not a shark in here. It probably did, but they trust us more than they do their own instincts. They have never been lied to before. Maybe we could ask some less emotional questions. I think that would be an excellent idea. How far can he swim, ah without breath? Fa ... Fa.... how far can you swim? - ONE DAY. - One day. Yes, but how fast. Well, Alpha conceives of distance in terms of time. He can swim without stopping for one day. At what speed? I would estimate, with maximum energy, between Doctor Terrell, if, as you say, Alpha Beta is teaching Beta to speak ... ... are you suggesting that, if you were to set Alpha free... ... he might pass on his facility to others of his kind? We might have a whole ocean full of English speaking dolphins? No I'm not, ah... He'd revert to his, ah... Normal system of communication. Speaking our language is very difficult for him. Why is he doing it then? What motivates him? He does it for me. Why? Fa ... Fa. Why does Fa speak? - FA Speak. - Yes, why, Fa, Speak? Fa Speak Pa. Why does Fa speak to Pa? Fa love... Pa. They're leaving. They are going to the plane. I hope somehow you can convey our appreciation to the little fellows themselves. I'll try to... What is it? They set up some sort of press conference. They want me to go over there right away. I'm terribly sorry, I thought all that had been explained to you before we got here. I'm afraid there isn't room for everyone on the plane. Why don't you get whatever you need and Harold will go with you in your boat... ... and explain it all to you on the way over. I'll come with you. that would be delightful. yeah, of course I love to have you. Make sure they don't go over the nets again. ... and don't leave them alone understand? Don't worry Jake. I'll get on the radio and ask for some advice. Don't go away. Who is this ah Mahoney, Harold? Why did you send for him? I don't really know who he is. He's got a lot of pull with the people in the government. He put some pressure on us. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you about it before. I didn't know how much he knew. I would have told you if I did. I hope you believe me Jake. yeah. It doesn't matter. Why doesn't it? Tomorrow I'll say it all myself. Let the press find out who Mahoney is, and what the foundation is afraid of. They want a press conference... I'll give them a press conference. Hello. I can't hear you. What? Jake, yeah it's me. yeah that's better. Go ahead. But Jake ... no ... I'm not arguing... I said, I'm not arguing with you... I just don't understand why... OK, I got it. yeah, I'm sure. We'll do it don't worry... I said.... Don't worry. Do you want to tell MaryAnn anything about... Jake ... hello ... Jake. I don't get it. Do you have any... Oh I don't like those. It's a quarter after twelve... ... it is? Oh it's almost time for lunch. - Jake. I'm going to give them about 5 more minutes. Then what are you going to do. I may set fire to her desk. - Doctor Terrell. I'm so sorry. Please sit down. I'm Mrs. Rome. Mr. Simon's executive secretary. You're Mrs. Terrell aren't you. So nice to meet you. - Who is Mr. Simon? Oh don't you know Mr. Simon? The fact of the matter is...that there has been one of those, unforeseeable events. which one? - Which what? - Which one of those unforeseeable events? I see what you mean. But seriously the director has been taken ill. We haven't received word yet on exactly what his condition is. He's been taken to the hospital. We're... we're all keeping our fingers crossed. Where is Mr. DeMilo? - Mr. DeMilo? - Mr. Harold DeMilo. - Mr. De Milo is at the hospital with the director of course. "Oh". I have been asked to apologize to you for the inconvenience. And to tell you that the director, will contact you, at your center, as soon as he is able. What happens if he is not able to contact me? What happens if there is no able to be contacted? While I'm sure he will, sooner or later. Mrs. Rome, you will forgive me if I seem unsympathetic, but... ... but there was a reason for my coming here today. Now I've left my work, I've had a boat trip. I've spent a reasonably sleepless night in a motel without any air conditioning... and very little air... - I'm so... Dr. Terrell would like to know what happened to the press conference? Oh we've had to cancel all of today's events. As a matter of fact everything for the rest of the week... until we're further informed. I wish you could see the list of things that we've had on our schedule. As it is, I'm afraid we'll just have to... tread water until we receive further instructions. Maggie ... May I tell the director that you asked after him? Only if he lives. I can't get through... why not? Some kind of interference. I didn't make that call. But David was talking to you Jake. No he wasn't. Well he was talking to somebody. Well I... he thought he was talking to Jake or... ...or he lied. Now tell me again. The stretchers came from the boat. yeah, ... they were brought off the yacht by a couple of men. You don't remember seeing any name on that boat Larry Go on... Mary Ann and I... ... helped David get Alpha and Beta into the stretchers. Did they put up a fight? Didn't they do anything? What? - We told them that you were on a yacht. - You lied to them. Whose bright idea was it? - David. - That's right. Don't say anything! - SORRY - I don't think there's anything more that we can do tonight Jake. Do you? I mean the phone is out. what do you think? No. I mean a, yes you're right there's nothing we can do. Jake ... let's take a walk outside We can cook something out there. Ok, ... Ok. Why are we all whispering when the thing's inside the house. There may be others... So what how far can it transmit? Maybe to a booster somewhere on the island. - Who put the intercom in your house? - David. - When? Just before we put Alpha and Beta together. - You and Jake have been on the air for 6 months! I think I'd like to kill him. It's just possible that it's not David's fault. His names on David. It's William. His name is not David, than William. C for Charles, Konklin. Trained in the Navy as a demolitions man. While he was stationed at San Diego ... ... is decided to supplement his income... ... by bringing a couple of pounds of heroin across the border. - Jesus. They gave him 15 to 20 years at hard labor of which he did about 8 months. Who got him out? The guys you work for. What the hell are you talking about. I don't work for them. Oh really. I always thought you work for the people that pay you. That's not fair. Lady I never said it was fair. Who do you work for Mr. Mahoney, assuming that's your real name. I work for the guys that pay me to watch the guys that pay you. And then there are, I imagine, some guys that are paid to watch me. Thats some business you're in. Yeah, it works toward a full employment economy... watchers watching watchers. - With us at the end. No, you're watching the dolphins. - Where are they? - The dolphins? I would guess they're on that yacht. What are they gonna do with them? That's the part we don't know. What we do know is that they've been working on this thing since you started teaching your friend Alpha to talk. How do we stop them? From doing what? That's the point. At the moment assuming we could find them... We could get them on the unique charge of kidnapping a bottle nose dolphin... I'm not even sure it's a crime. Are you just going to sit here? You're not going to do anything? Look, Number 1, the boat we came in has been scuttled in about 20 feet of water. Number 2... whose we? Uh there's a Mr. Stone, a friend of mine. I think I'd better start trying to find him. Wait a minute, wait a minute. If it's true as you say... - ... that Franklin drew foundation got David... I'm telling you... All right, got the son of a bitch out of jail... ... then that implies that they must have some very powerful connections. That's what it implies. that means with the government. Yes, you may call them a part of the government. Well what government do you work for? What government have you got? What the hell is that supposed to mean? Doctor Terrell, there are 2 or 3 million people working for the government... ... and that's not including the military. Did you think that E Pluribus Unum was engraved on anything other than our small change? Or haven't you been living on this planet. Then how did you get Harold DeMilo to let you come down here in the first place? That was easy. I let on that I knew about David... William. And that I'd be willing to keep it a secret if he let me look around. And then there were a couple of other things... Like what? Like the fact that I have information concerning DeMilo's activities as a homosexual. Which would have come as a hell of a shock to his wife and kids. You're a real charmer Mr. Mahoney. It must be very proud of your work. Go ahead answer it. Yes? - Jake ... - Where are they Harold. Jake I don't want you to say anything... The phone will only be operative for a few minutes. I want you to know that the "equipment" we borrowed, is in fine shape... ... and will be returned to you very soon, if nothing interferes with it. Don't leave the island Jake. Do you understand? Yes. Mike ... ... get the boat ready. Jake, you can't leave, not while they've got Alpha and Beta. - I can't, but one you can... and do what? Call some newspapers, tell them what's happened. You're going to call the New York Times... ... and tell them that a group of respectable business men stole... ... some talking dolphins from you? yeah, something like that why not? Are you prepared to give your interview in a padded cell? - We have tapes of Alphas speech. You wanna bet? Hang on. Lets be careful of what we say. You may be broadcasting from in here too. Hello. Is everything all right? You feeling good? that's good? We'll see Pa tomorrow. See Pa... light. Was he a good friend? Pretty good. - I'm sorry. Yeah. Well he shouldn't have come down here. He should have waited for me, he made a mistake. It won't happen again. One ... two ... three ... ... Four ... five ... sixth ... ... seven ... eight ... nine ... ... Ten ... Eleven ... Twelve ... ... thirteen, fourteen ... Fifteen ... ... Sixteen ... seventeen Eighteen ... ... Nineteen ... Twenty ... boom. They'll kill them. They'll kill them won't they? Yes of course they will. Why? They've killed a man. Do you think they're going to get sentimental about a dolphin? But ... Jake, why. What would be the point of killing them? Alpha can talk. We taught him, remember? He's a witness. Come Fa. Come. Fa... come here. FA want PA. Whats the matter? ...want Pa. He wants Terrell. Pa is waiting for Fa. Man say things not. Pa's here. - NO! Get that goddamn animal in here will you. Get back. Get out of his sight. Get Beta up on deck. If we have her he won't go anywhere. - Fa! - We can't wait any longer. Let's get going. Let's get out of here. I think you got him. You better hope so mister. But it doesn't matter. When this day is over we're going to go back to Terrell's place and have one hell of a dolphin hunt. Oh, Mother of God! Terrell... Look at this. That's Andrews bay. How far is it? Oh 2, 2-1/2 hours. Ever been there? A lot of rich people go there. Catch fish that they don't eat, they get natives to bait the hook for them... Its very exclusive, no? - Millionaires, movie stars retired gangsters. - Presidents? Yeah, so? So I'm imagining an animal getting through a protected area... ... that a man or a boat couldn't penetrate. - So what? - Jake ... Maggie! How does he know where the yacht went? He can taste it. He's following the trail in the water. We can't do it Jake. We haven't got enough power. We're just slow him down. Well how about lightening the load? You wanna swim alongside for awhile? Well we don't need him do we? He your friend, you wanna through him over the side? He's still dead isn't he? Shut the engine. Fa ... Fa... Come... Fa... Listen Fa ... - Can you find Bee? - Find Bee! Find Bee. Stop Bee. The thing on Bee's back... ... the thing.... Ball.... yes, the ball... on Bee's back is not good. Not good... - The ball will hurt man. Ball is play. No. The ball is not play. The ball kills, the ball is bad... - FA play Bee not. - Yes. Fa stop Bee now. NOW! Let's get to a phone or a radio. We can't. Alpha's taken us out too far. We've only got enough gas to get back. - What do we do Jake? - Nothing we can do, we're finished. Bee want Fa? First Bee find boat. Put ball under boat then come back, see Fa. Bee find boat, now! Oh, shit. Here comes something! Fa ... where is the ball? What did Bee do with the ball? BALL IS NOT ... Did Fa stop Bee? Stop Bee. Listen Fa ... ... the boat, where is the boat. Not! Which one, which boat? Say to Pa the boat that is not. Boat is not. Fa, where is the boat with David? Not. That's the one. - Fa, where's David? - Not. - And the other men. Where are they? - Not. They're all dead. Jake, we gotta get out of here. They'll be coming. They're all dead. There'll be others. They'll come for them. Alfa, listen to Pa. Fa love Pa. Yes Pa knows. Listen Alpha, some men will come here. Men who are not good. Fa and Bee must go. Fa stay with Pa. No. Fa and Bee go now. Pa not love Fa? Yes, Pa loves Fa and Bee, Ma loves Fa and Bee. Fa love Ma. Everybody loves everybody now for Christs sake lets get the hell out of here! Listen Fa ... ..Pa and Ma go to the land. Fa and Bee, go to water. Fa not see man, not talk to man. - FA talk. Not Talk! Swim, eat, play, not talk! So long folks. Fa ... men come now ... Men are bad. Men will hurt Ma. Men hurt Pa. Hurt Pa ... - Yes ... Fa go now men not hurt Pa. Men hurt Pa. Yes. Fa go now. Ma love Fa. Stop it Maggie, let them go. Ma loves Bi. You, Fa, love... No! No like! Pa is not! - PA ... Don't turn around, keep going. PA ... PA ...
