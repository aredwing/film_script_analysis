Aren't you coming? No, I'm not. You go by yourself. I'll stay here. But the maid's here. I've still got things to do. You're still angry, aren't you? It was my fault. Come on, get changed and we'll go together. Why don't you wear that new obi belt you bought? Don't mess up the drawer. This one? Aren't you going to change, my dear? I'll go just as I am, I always do. You're still hiding something from me, I know. That's enough! Don't be ridiculous... You don't like being seen with me at your side. Shizu... stop it. But... what else am I supposed to think? Stop talking like this. There is no other woman. Then why shouldn't I accompany you to Kaji's grave? But I just asked you to come! No! You don't really want me to. Shizu, you misunderstand me. Please, just go alone. Idiot! It's not what you're thinking! KAJI Died - 23rd October 1897 Sensei! Have you been following me? Your wife said that I'd find you here. Did my wife tell you whose grave I was visiting? No... I actually wanted to borrow some books, sir. For my graduation thesis. I see. You can borrow whatever you need. Thank you very much. - Is your family tomb here, sir? - No. - Then whose grave is it? A relative's? - No. It's my friend's grave. - And you visit it every month? - That's right. There are so many different kinds of graves here. It's interesting... Perhaps I could come with you next time you visit. I like it here. I prefer to come alone. I don't even bring my wife. Listen, Hioki, you've probably never thought seriously about death. What was my wife doing? She was watering the plants. I see... Shall we go for a beer? - Do you drink, sir? - I haven't had one for a while. It's just nearby. Beer... Two beers, please. Sorry, sorry. Why is it you call round to see me so often? There's no particular reason. - Would you prefer I didn't? - No, not at all. I'm a lonely person. So I'm always happy to see you. I was just interested in your reasons for visiting. But why, sir? - How old are you? - Twenty-three. Do you feel lonely at times, then? I never feel lonely. Then why do you come calling at my house? See? But coming round to my house won't make you feel any less lonely. But I respect your knowledge, sir. Why do you respect me as your "sensei"? I'm a wretched man. What a day! Did you not have a pleasant day? I had an argument with my wife. With your wife? She showed no sign of it. She misunderstands me. How does she misunderstand you, sir? After we argued, I shouldn't have walked out like I did. She's the only woman in this world I've ever known. I can't think of any other women apart from my wife. And my wife... she thinks the same about me. We ought to be the happiest couple in the world. Ought to be? That means you're not? - Do we look it? - Yes... Funny, isn't it? Well... I ought to get back home to my wife. I have to go, too. No, stay, please. I'll leave some money. Oh... you wanted to borrow some books, didn't you? No... Well, it doesn't have to be today, sir. Very well. Extra! Extra! NOBUCHI I'm afraid these editions aren't that recent. Thank you, sir. I don't know how much that author will help you in your thesis. He's certainly quite eclectic, but his own ideas are pretty much half-conceived. His writing is full of quotations from other people. Do you know him, Sensei? Yes, I knew him when he was a student. - You must be hungry, Hioki. - Please don't go to any trouble. I'm sure he'd prefer a beer. I heard you both went for a drink recently. You should go more often. You should come along next time, a drink would do you good. Oh, not for me, I can't drink at all. I'm just glad it makes you feel good. Not always, it doesn't. I'm sure the odd drink of an evening would do you no harm. - That wouldn't do. - Go on. You wouldn't feel so lonely. Drinking alcohol doesn't necessarily lead to a good time. Kume? Kume! Go and buy me that news extra. There's nothing wrong with Sensei's health, is there? No, he's absolutely fine. He never gets ill. You're always to be found here, sir, thinking and studying, yet you don't go out to work at all? I'm not qualified to do anything out there in the world of work. Why not? You know so much. He wasn't like that in his younger days. - When was that? - In his student days. You've known him since your student days? We've been married for 13 years. I would have loved to have children. - Shall we adopt one? - An adopted one? No! - We'll never have children. - Please, dear... Sensei, why not? Divine retribution, that's why. MORNING NEWS DIGEST: "Emperor Meiji Seriously lll" Your father has kidney trouble, doesn't he? Yes, for a long time now. He should look after himself. When an illness seems to have abated, that's the most critical time. Sensei... why do you treat your wife like that? I just haven't grown up. There's been another thief in the neighbourhood. And Kume has toothache. I wondered why she had such a face on her! I've told her to go to the dentist but she won't. So I'm taking her. Nice to see you, Hioki. She's an unhappy woman. She has only me to depend on, that's why. - Dinner's almost ready. - I'm going to visit my sensei. Again? Why do you go round there so often? What about your graduation thesis? Sensei is out. I'll be looking after his place. Isn't his wife there? There've been thieves in the area, and she's afraid on her own. Oh, really? She must be very beautiful, his wife. That's not the reason! - You must be bored. - No. I keep thinking about the thief, so I'm on edge... not bored. Help yourself to any of the books. Does your husband often go out in the evenings? No, hardly ever. Of late, he's taken a dislike to meeting anybody. - Apart from you, of course. - No, myself included. - That's not true. - Why? Because he loves his wife, he hates the outside world. You're a typical scholar, all wrapped up in your theories. Shall I make some tea? You've gone all silent on me. You'd only scold me about my "theories". Not at all... - Go on. - I'll ask you then... How much do you love your husband? Why do you have to ask me such questions? How many, one lump or two? You know before... when I asked him about working? You said he wasn't always like that. I could rely on him. - Did he change all of a sudden? - Not suddenly. It was more gradual. And you were with him all through this? Well, we were married. But, as his wife, you must surely know the reason for such a change. Hioki! Do you think it's all my fault? Not at all. I don't know how many times I've asked him, "If it's something I've done, then please tell me frankly." Had the fault been mine, I'd have changed it, but all he'd say was, "You are faultless, the blame all rests with me." Hioki, please help me. Since you've known him, has he mentioned nothing to you? If you know anything, you must tell me. It was while I was staying at a friend's house. I thought he must be a local. He looked as though he'd entered the water never to return. My imagination must have been running wild. That's how I met Sensei. Nothing more than that... Since then, I've felt a strong bond with Sensei. However, I still have no idea what kind of a man he is. There is something that I remember, though... You mean about why he changed? Perhaps you can explain it... I will try my best. It was when he was still at university, and he had a very close friend. The friend died just before graduation. It was all very sudden. It was an unnatural death. What happened? From that time onwards, he began to change. I don't know how his friend died. My husband probably doesn't either. Then it must be his grave he visits. Yes. Can the loss of someone close change a person in such a way? - Welcome home. - Thanks for keeping the thieves away. - I think he was disappointed! - Really? You must've been bored. - Stay a while and relax. - Come on through. Where did you disappear to, sir? Sensei, I realise I've learnt more from you than from all my courses. Don't be so conceited. Do you not believe me, sir? Not you in particular. I just don't believe anyone. Not even your wife, sir? I don't even believe myself. Basically, because I can't believe myself, I can't believe anyone else. I'm cursed, there's nothing I can do about it. - Lf you think like that, then everyone... - No. I don't think that way, I act that way. Kaji! What is it, sir? Sir? What happened? Sir, let's take a rest. Very well. What time is it? It's still early. Your wife asked us to be back for 5:00. She shouldn't go to any trouble on my behalf. Well, graduation is a cause for celebration. - They look like newly-weds. - They seem very close. Have you ever fallen in love? Never, Sensei. Love is a sin. Did you know that? - Why? - You'll understand. Please explain in more detail what you mean by sin? Forgive me being so direct, but does your family have wealth? Not that much. I know your father's not going to die yet, but you should make sure you get your inheritance. My family are country people. They're honest folks. So all country people are honest? They may seem good people, but they can turn dishonest just like anybody else. What do you mean by that? It's the truth... not theory. I was cheated out of my inheritance by my very own relatives. It was after my parents passed away. Before my mother died, she asked my uncle to take care of everything. He was known as an honest man... At least, that's what I believed when I went off to university in Tokyo. I spent each summer holiday back at home in the country. We'd all have met you at the station if you'd given me notice. Not at all. Oh, Uncle, I'd like to talk to you about the place at Urayama. - Why do you bring that up suddenly? - Someone's interested in buying it. But I require your permission. It's not that simple. Why don't we sell it? We don't need it anymore. We can talk later. Your bath's ready. Chizu? Is the bath run? By the way, have you thought any more about Chizu? I think you'd make a splendid couple. I did promise your parents to look after their property and financial assets. - But Chizu's my cousin. - Even better! She knows you well. Well... we may have been friends as kids, but marriage is a different thing altogether I'm sure Chizu thinks the same. I won't marry for your sake. What are you saying? You're... He wanted to trick me out of my money. I realised that the marriage to my cousin was simply a cover-up. While my father was alive, my uncle had been a good man, but now money had changed him into a dishonest one. I'll never forget that day as long as I live. Since then, I've never trusted anyone. Sir, you said that you could trust neither yourself nor your wife? That's because... ...l'm only human, too. Sensei, you're hiding something... No, I'm not. You're hiding something. Listen, Hioki... I think you're confusing my past experiences with my present thoughts. No, Sensei, what happened in your past has shaped your present. For me, experience and ideas are worthless if one separates them. That's why I seek advice from you, sir. You're brave. I just want to learn from life. Even from my own dark past? My past experience has taught me to distrust others. But I would like to believe in you. You're too innocent to distrust. I wanted to be able to believe in someone before I died. Would you... be that person for me? - Yes. - Very well. Then I shall tell you. I'll tell you all about my past. But not now. I promise I'll talk when the time is right. Shall we head back? My wife's probably got the food ready. Where is your graduation certificate, Sensei? I wonder what happened to it. It'll be around somewhere. I put it away some place. What are your plans for the future? To be honest, I haven't really thought about it at all. Your family has money, so you've no worries. - I'm a bit like your husband... - But you ought to have a job. You mustn't emulate him in his idleness. I don't idle my time away. How's your father coping with his illness? I don't think he'll live much longer. His illness is incurable. There isn't much hope. Shizu... I wonder if you'll die before me. Why? I was just wondering, that's all. Maybe I'll be the first to go. Usually, it's the husband who dies first. Not necessarily. But maybe it's because the husband's usually older. Exactly, that's why I'll die first. - You're an exception to the rule. - Really? You're in good health, so it's likely that I'll be the first to die. Yes, definitely me. What would you do, if I died first? What do you mean? What could I do about it? - What do you think? - I really couldn't say. Of course, it depends on your life span. When will you get back from the countryside? September, probably. If I die, I'll leave you this house, my dear. "If I die, if I die"! Is that all you can say? Even if you die, I'll do whatever you decree. Isn't that enough? Jiro's back, my dear. Ah, you're home. Hello, Father. And you've graduated, that's good. Help me sit up. - Lt's good to see you. - Ls it all right to sit him up? Of course it is. I'm very pleased... that you've graduated. Yes, indeed. Graduating from university is no big thing. Hundreds of students graduate every year. Yes, but... it means a lot to me. Otherwise, I could have died and never have known that my son had graduated from university. It's wonderful. Last year when Jiro came home, the doctor told us that you'd only have three or four months left to live But you've survived thus far. Yes, I'm lucky... Jiro... You probably don't think it's very important that you've graduated from university, but to me, it's wonderful news. Let me see your graduation certificate. You should roll it more carefully! You must look after it! Display it in the alcove. Have you written to your sensei to ask for his help in finding you work? Yes, I sent him a letter. What does your sensei do? He doesn't do anything. Surely, he must do something. I guess he does something. If he's as fine a man as you say he is, then he's bound to find you some work. The Emperor has at last passed away. AS AHI NEWSPAPER: "Emperor Meiji Passes Away" Dear, I'm going to pay my respects to the Emperor. You do that. I'll stay here and pray quietly. Afterwards, may I call in to see my aunt in Kanda? I heard she's not well. Give her my regards. Oh, the buds have blossomed. It's grown so quickly. Oh, yes, you must answer Hioki's letter. It's been quite a while. "Thank you for your letter. "I have been meaning to reply to your request "for help in finding you some form of employment." Kaji... - Kaji, it's fine. - What is? The lodgings! The landlady is friendly, and she says it's fine. - At your place? - Yes, the room next to mine is vacant. - Hey, that's good, isn't it? - Watch it! What good is chopping wood for the temple going to do you? I'd rather stay here. Give it up. It's not good for you, all this hard labour. - I can look after myself. - I know that. But you have to think about your future. If you get sick, that'll be the end for you. One's future stems from one's present. I'm not denying your philosophy or religious leanings. All I'm saying is, your health is important to your studies and your future. But beyond my studies, I want to strengthen my will. But working yourself into an early grave in vain isn't going to help you. "In vain"? It's not in vain, it'll make me strong and independent. For a person to grow, they must show perseverance in adversity. Right? I've been disowned. I've no money for tuition fees. But that has made me stronger. Even chopping wood for this poor temple, at least I'm following my own independent path. I understand. I am lacking in your strength of character. - I'm sorry for what I said. - You've no need to apologise. - What I'm doing is my own choice. - Lt's not that... Despite your family's opposition, you were determined to leave home to study philosophy. I supported your decision then, and I'm in no position to criticise your choices now. Let me learn from you, from your way of life. - I'm not asking you to live like me. - I know. I want to. Please. Let's share lodgings. Let me learn from you. There it is. Hello? Welcome back. My dear? - You weren't long. - Evening. I just heard that crowds of people are mourning outside the lmperial Palace. Really? Well, it's to be expected. The Meiji Era has ended. There'll be a new lmperial Era, and we'll have to change with the times. It won't be that easy. People like us were born and bred in the Meiji Era. I think we'll always feel behind the times and not understand the future. If you're so stuck in the past, then why not follow the Emperor in death? Follow the Emperor in death? That's right, some people have followed the Emperor in death... If I were to commit suicide, it wouldn't be to honour another person but for the spirit of the Meiji Era! Koichi's here, my dear! Sorry I'm so late. I'd have brought my wife, but she's just given birth. We're just glad that you could come. It would've been too much of a worry bringing her here after having a baby. When I recover, I'll come to Kyushu to see your new baby I'd be so delighted if you'd take me with you, my dear. I'm glad you're in better spirits than I thought you'd be. - A telegram. From Tokyo. - For me? "Must talk. Come see me. Nobuchi" He's followed the Emperor in death... in death... in death. General Nogi has committed suicide. Ever since the Satsuma Rebellion, when he lost his regimental colours to the enemy, he has wanted to commit suicide in atonement. For over 35 years, he had waited for the opportunity to die. And on the day of the Emperor's funeral his chance finally arrived... - My dear... ...just as the guns were fired in salute. They delayed the announcement. A telegram arrived from Hioki. "Cannot come. Father critical. Hioki" When did you telegraph him? You must have contacted him, otherwise he'd never have sent you this telegram. When did you telegraph Hioki? Why did you summon him? What do you want Hioki for? - Shizu... - What are you hiding from me? - I'm not hiding anything. - You're lying! Why can't I know? About you and Hioki? About you and Kaji? About Kaji? Yes... he was once your best friend. After his death, I wasn't even allowed to mention his name. - Why did you forbid it? - Shizu, please! Until now, I have never once mentioned it. And now Hioki... He's the only friend we have. I was so happy for you, but now it's happening all over again. Between me and Hioki? Shizu, I don't know what you're talking about. Don't lie to me, please. Something's going on between you and Hioki that I don't know about. I am your wife. I've been by your side for 13 years. Do you love your friends more than you love me? I want to know what you feel in your heart. You're mistakenly confusing Kaji and Hioki. You know who means more to me. Listen... Please! Leave me alone! Madam, what would you like me to buy... for supper? Let me see... as we've not had any for a while, let's have tofu this evening. My husband likes it very much. "I have just received your telegram "saying that you will be unable to come to Tokyo "due to the fact that your father is gravely ill." "General Nogi and his wife follow Emperor Meiji in death" "The reason I wanted to see you "is that I feel the time has come to talk with you about my past." So you're saying that Kaji's a bit cold-hearted? What I meant is that I, too, was like that once. And now, Nobuchi-san? Has your icy heart melted at last? I'm talking seriously. I mean, although our personalities differ, our circumstances are similar. But he's rather standoffish. I've become more sociable since coming to stay here with you both. You're just flattering us! No, it's true. To be perfectly honest, I distrusted you when I first arrived. Well, now! Like I said, I was betrayed by my own relatives, so I naturally distrusted everyone. So you thought I was after your money, too? That's not what I meant! You've nothing to worry about. I'd never marry for money! - Here's your shirt, freshly laundered. - Thank you. Please, don't misunderstand me. For me, now... You don't have to explain. It's all water under the bridge now. Of course it is. I've come to understand what a good-hearted person you are. And me? You, too, Miss. Oh, is that all I am? I want your help with Kaji. Unlike me, he puts all his strength into following his spiritual path. Which path? His path is... ...a religious and philosophical one, the way of all human beings, I guess. - Well, a man of noble aims. - Absolutely so. But he's been overdoing the physical labour, and it's affecting both his physical and spiritual health. I think he may be close to a nervous breakdown. So, as his friend... No, as a fellow human being, I want to help him. Please, I want to ask you to watch over him. Your heart is in the right place. However... I'm home. Welcome home! May I come in? - Here you are. - Thanks. - Are you not feeling hungry? - Lndeed I am. - Shall I prepare some food for you? - There's no need. But you must be famished. Yes, but I want nothing. This is for board and lodging for both Kaji and myself. - Please don't tell Kaji. - Are you sure, Nobuchi-san? Yes, of course. But Kaji's such a proud fellow... - Something's not quite right with him. - You mean with Kaji? Yes, I do. Of course, renting two rooms is more profitable than one, but I can survive on my late husband's war pension. I don't really need the business, and I wanted to refuse you at first. I know he seems sullen, but he's a good man. No, I don't mean that. I'm talking about his influence over you. Over me? What do you mean? How does Kaji have a bad influence on me? Kaji-san's a strange one. He's hungry but refuses to eat anything. What? - Kaji... - You're back? I finished early today. - You're always chatting to her. - She lives here. So what? You're wasting your time with her. You think so? Hey, you can use my room if you like. I prefer my own. And I'm closing these. I'm back! Come on, let me darn it for you. I'm the best in the sewing class. - Welcome home. - Are you just back? Where's your mother? Isn't she in? Did she have to rush out? No, she just went out to get something. - Mother, something's wrong. - What is it? - Nobuchi-san's angry with me. - Why? I've no idea. I was just talking to Kaji-san in his room... I don't want to catch you in Kaji's room again! Oh... deep in study? You work so hard. Please help yourself to some snacks. Thank you very much. Nobuchi-san, apologies for being out before. The fishmonger didn't come as expected, so I had to go and fetch the fish myself. I do apologise. No, not at all... it's fine. Well... l'm back now. Sorry for disturbing you. Miss? Oh, when did you get back? - Please give me back my hakama. - They're still torn in several places. Stop, please! I told you yesterday! They're my things! Why are you bothering me like this? - Do you like looking so scruffy? - Yes! Please don't raise your voice to me. I can hear you well enough! As long as you understand! Don't you agree, Kaji, that women aren't to be underestimated? The landlady's a good person. And her daughter's very kind to us, too. Think so? Let's rest a while. I'm glad you're feeling better. You've been getting back from college early. The lectures are boring. You study better at home? - The daughter's graduating next year. - Ls she? Women can graduate having learned nothing at all. Studying isn't everything. Women have to learn to sew, play the koto, flower arranging... Both of you will be graduating next year, won't you? And you, too, Miss. - What if I should fail? - Well, you don't study hard enough. But you won't tutor me. Shizu! Kaji, let's go somewhere for the summer holidays. - Lf there's a reason you can't go... - There's no reason. I'd just prefer to stay here and study. We should escape the summer heat, it would be better for your health. Then go by yourself. I won't. I won't go if you don't. Why not? You should go. You can afford it. It's not about money. You're not showing perseverance, you're just being stubborn! According to Buddhist tenets, worldly pleasures and desires are bad, but it's dangerous to be obsessed with only spiritual matters! - You know nothing about Buddhism. - Maybe so, but I know how to live life! What's going on, Nobuchi-san? He's been acting so strange recently. I don't think so. He's finishing his meal, he seems fine. You're both just indulging him. But did you not ask us to take care of him? I did try to warn you. Aren't you glad you came? What are you thinking about? Nothing. What if I pushed you into the sea? Go on... do it. I'm heading back. Hey... your hand towel. - A priest from the Nichiren Sect. - Leave him be! - Where are you heading, master? - I'm going to Tanjo Temple. Is it far? It's in a village called Kominato, a few miles from here. It's Nichiren's birthplace. What do you think of Nichiren's teachings, master? In Kominato, there's a beach called "Sea-Bream Beach", where two sacred sea-bream were landed the day Nichiren was born... I mean his teachings today. Well... Nichiren was famous for his beautiful calligraphy... Kaji, we've still got some way to go. If you're in a rush, then go on ahead. Who cares whether his calligraphy was beautiful or not? He knows nothing about Nichiren's teachings! That's why I told you to leave him alone. Priests are ignorant. Shut up! Only a fool ignores his spiritual development! Maybe so, but one should never ignore one's humanity. Am I not human? Yes, but your talk of asceticism and spirituality is just an act! I'm not disciplined enough. Stop being so obstinate. Nobuchi, it's a shame you have no idea how much I suffer for my soul. I do know! Nobuchi! If you hate me that much, I'll go back to Tokyo. Keep walking. Walk! Kaji... where've you been? Just out. And you? The bookshop. Why don't you put the lamp on? Matches? Nobuchi-san's late, isn't he? Will you wait to eat with him? - Welcome back. - Evening. Right, shall we start supper? I've already eaten. Whatever for? Kaji-san's been waiting for you. Kaji-san, please help yourself to food. Kaji? Did you go out with her? No, we ran into each other in town. I escorted her home. You finished classes early today. Guess where I've been. I have no idea. Go on, guess. - Kaji-san's so strange. - Why? When he saw me in town, he ran off, so I followed him. What is it? I'm going for supper. Aunty must be so happy that cousin Zenji's become a lieutenant. Will tonight's celebration be a big affair? What? What? I was asking you about tonight's party! What? Oh, never mind. Oh, Shizu? Did you ask Nobuchi-san to take care of the fire after supper? What? What did you say? What about Nobuchi-san? What are you thinking about? Nothing at all. The mother and daughter have gone to Kanda? To their aunt's. Who's this aunt? She's the wife of a military man. Why have they gone? For some party or other. - Why aren't they home yet? - I don't know. Why do you ask? I thought... I thought I was stronger than this. But, as you said... I'm merely human after all. No wonder I'm so contemptible. And I've been lying not only to you... ...but to myself as well. I'm suffering. But... ...I can't get her out of my mind. I've been trying to hide the way I feel about her from you. - Kaji! - I... Whenever she comes into my room... ...my heart misses a beat with the love I feel for her. What you just told me... have you told anybody else but me? No. Have you said anything to her or to her mother? No. I see... I understand how you feel, but what do you intend to do about it? What will you do? Nobuchi? Studying? Just researching something. Want to take a walk? I will in a while. I'll wait, then. Finished already? It's not important. - What do you think? - About what? About me... I'm ashamed of my weakness... I'm confused. Confused? What about? Do I go forward... or back? Could you go back if you had to? Could you? And what about following this "path" of yours? Was that all lies? "Only a fool ignores his spiritual development." "Only a fool ignores his spiritual development"! A fool... I'm a fool. Let's talk of it no more... please. But you brought up the subject in the first place. You can choose to rise above it, but you've got to mean it. You really have to mean it in your heart. In my heart, my mind's made up. - What's wrong? Not feeling well? - I think I've caught a cold. - Want me to call a doctor? - No, it's nothing. Just a headache. Look after yourself. See you later. Oh... you're ill, you shouldn't be up. I was just bringing you this. It's nice and hot. Thank you. Are you not hungry? Don't you like it? Yes, thank you. You're not busy this morning? No. Why do you ask? There's something I want to talk to you about. What is it? - Let's not be so formal... - I'm not being formal at all. Where's your daughter? She's gone to a friend's house. Some party or other. She'll be back home later tonight. - Has Kaji said anything to you lately? - Like what? - What's he said to you? - Not about him. So, then? Madam, I'd like to ask for your daughter's hand... please. Please... as my wife. I have no objections, but it's all a bit sudden. - I suddenly want her! - Have you thought about this carefully? I spoke out suddenly just now, but I've been considering it for a long time. - I just didn't have the courage to ask. - I see... I'd like to marry her immediately after I graduate next year. Very well, I'll give her to you. Sorry, I should phrase that with more humility. Please accept her. As you are well aware, the poor girl has no father. - Thank you so much. - Not at all, I am overjoyed. But... we should really ask your daughter how she feels. That's all right. I wouldn't force her into anything she didn't want to do. When are you going to tell your daughter? Anytime, it doesn't matter, does it? You have my consent. But if you'd prefer sooner rather than later, I'll tell her this evening. I'd prefer that... if you wouldn't mind. I'm just going out for a walk. - I'm home. - Welcome back. Kaji-san? - Where's Nobuchi? - He's been gone since this morning. - Where did he go? - "For a walk," he said. He's an odd one! Won't you have some tea? Come, sit yourself down. Kaji-san, what are your plans after graduation? Well... nothing in particular... I know we've become good friends, and I'd like you to stay on here, but after Shizu gets married, I imagine they'll want to live here. - Your daughter's getting married? - Well, nothing's been formalised yet. But Nobuchi-san seems to get on very well with her. Nobuchi is going to marry your daughter? Oh, you didn't know? Did Nobuchi-san say nothing to you about it? Nobuchi-san asked for my daughter's hand in marriage only today, so I imagine he'll want to tell you later. Or maybe he said nothing to you in case we refused. But what determination! He wants to get married immediately after graduation! I see... In any case, it's cause for celebration. You should be pleased for them. Congratulations. When's the wedding? We've not got that far yet! I'd like to give them a present, but I have no money... Oh, no... - Welcome home. - I just got back. Why didn't you say anything to Kaji-san? I didn't have the opportunity. That's not good, is it? He's such a close friend and yet you didn't tell him? Anyway, he seems very happy for you. Is that so? Hey... are you feeling better now? You shouldn't be going out. I got you some medicine. I got you some medicine. I'll leave it there. Hey! Is anything the matter? "Nobuchi, Brother" "I have given in to my weaknesses and I have no hope, so I am ending my life. "You have been so good to me for all these years. Thank you. "Please take care of things for me after my death, "and apologise to the landlady for the trouble I have caused. "Please send word to my family. "I should have committed suicide earlier. I don't know why it took this long." Who's that? Nobuchi-san? Today's Sunday. Madam, if you're awake, could you come? What is it? - Something terrible's happened. - What is it? Madam... Kaji has committed suicide. I'm so sorry... for you and your daughter that this has happened. It was completely unforeseen... There's nothing that can be done now. Open the rain shutters, please. "Please come urgently. Your son has died." How much is that? My son always was a little odd. He often spoke of his hatred for this world. He never came across like that. With regard to his remains, I think he should be buried in Zoshigaya Cemetery. He really liked the place. The two of us often went for walks there. Thank you so much for all your care and attention. May we proceed with the funeral arrangements? Lift your end more. Supper's ready, my dear! The tofu they had today wasn't that good. Since General Nogi's death, stores have been closed in mourning. I wonder how Hioki's father is? I feel so sorry for the poor boy. How's your aunt in Kanda? Why don't you look after her for a while? Her illness will last a while yet. You don't have to worry about me. Well, maybe I should go, then. You could go tomorrow. I'll be on my way, then. Take your time. And give your aunt my regards. Kume? Take some days off and go visit your home village "Nobuchi, Tokyo" If you've anything to ask of him, I'd ask now. What do you think about taking over this place? You're the eldest, you move back home. I couldn't bear living in the country. You think about it. "When you first asked me about my past, "I couldn't find the courage within me to tell you. "Now I believe the time has come for me to be frank with you. "This is why I asked you to come back to Tokyo." Jiro? Jiro! Jiro, bring some ice. "By the time this letter "is delivered into your hands... "...I shall no longer be of this world." Is that a letter from your sensei? Please, you should be by your father's side. Please, keep him alive for two or three days, that's all I ask. Give him injections, anything! I beg you! I am doing everything I can, as it is. But with this kind of illness, one never can tell... Please! "In my heart of hearts..." ... I still burn with the memory of that night when Kaji committed suicide. My conscience told me to confess to having caused his death, but I was afraid of what people would think. The best I could do as his friend was to set up his gravestone. It was very soon after that, that I moved to this house. As soon as I graduated, I married the daughter. Righteous Layman of Josho Temple A new grave for Kaji, a new wife for me. My thoughts turned to his bleached bones buried beneath us in the earth, and I could feel nothing but utter contempt for my fate. From that moment on, I decided I would never visit Kaji's grave with my wife ever again. Excuse me? Are you the mistress of the house? I'm from the employment agency. I've brought along your new maid, madam. Hey, show some manners! Her name's Kume. She's a country girl, so you'll have to excuse her rough edges. - But she's fit and healthy... - Please wait a moment. My dear... the new maid has arrived. Maid? Oh, yes. Well, as long as she seems nice... Didn't I say we didn't need a maid? Well, she can look after the house when you're out, and I want to enable your mother to take more time off, too. But we can't afford the expense. Day by day, we're using up all your inheritance. And you've never had any gainful employment. Tell me, what's the point of all your studying? All day every day, shut away in this room... Do you hate me that much? Don't start that again! You don't want me to do anything. Ever since we've been together, I've never once seen you happy. - Shizu... - Are you sorry you married me? No... I have no regrets at all. I'll try to get a job, if it's what you want. Right, I'll go and see a friend about it now. Bring me my kimono. Every time I looked at my wife, I was reminded of Kaji. So long as she was there, I could never forget Kaji. So many times I wanted to confess everything to my wife, but each time, something inside me sapped my strength. I couldn't tell even my wife, the one person I trusted most in this world. And then her mother passed away. The country was celebrating victory in the Russo-Japanese War. What are you sewing? I wonder if you'll like it. It's something I bought for you at Mitsukoshi. Looks nice. Would you have preferred something darker? I now have no-one but you in this world. You're an unhappy woman. Why? Why must I be so unhappy? The very fact that I was alive made my wife unhappy. It certainly wasn't my intention to die that day, but if I'd continued swimming further out, then I'd probably have drowned. Hioki... that's the very first time we met. I realised that I'd put myself under intense nervous strain, and all I wanted was to find relief from the pressure. - Will it grow? - I wonder. Welcome back, sir. A Mr Hioki came by earlier to see you. Really? - What did he want? - I'm not sure... It's not often we get someone coming round to visit you. - Who is this Hioki-san? - He's a student. - Where did you meet him? Is he nice? - Yes, he's a nice lad. Well, it's good that you've made a new friend. Is it? The garden needs tidying up, my dear. It's such a mess. Hioki, you were the only bridge between us and the world outside. I wish I'd told you everything I felt in my heart. Opening up to you would have saved me, perhaps, but for me that was impossible. I should simply have died and said nothing. But I couldn't die without leaving this testament. Whichever way I look at it, I lack the strength of spirit. First Year of the Taisho Era (1912) Funeral Ceremony for Emperor Meiji After 45 days of official mourning, the funeral procession leaves the lmperial Palace at 8:00pm. Aren't you going to bed yet? I'm staying up. The Emperor's funeral procession is just leaving the Palace. The Meiji reign has ended and passed into history, but time marches on. I didn't want my wife to have to watch me die. I will offer you my reasons for dying. Maybe they will teach you something. You are the only person I can tell. But please, it must be our final secret. My only wish is that my wife's memories of the past remain unsullied. "In Mourning" Hello? Madam... I lacked the strength to help him. The End
