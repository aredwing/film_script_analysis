Sorry. Now you are the king of the world. Yes. All for the winner. I guess. Johnny spent a long time. Think you can take away a fortune and stay with me as if... ...A used dress? 78,941 out of here. Come here, Kelly. Ven. You give up too soon. I am very expensive, very expensive. I do not want you to think you buy cheap. Still hurts, honey? So is yours. What do you have? Is the explosion of the press? A radio report? A boxer signed? Those betting on a horse not run again. I know. Of good ink. The bill is very high. How high? According to my information, more than 130 thousand. And all settled? In my experience Money buys everything. So pardon. Jerry, what do we do? Setting an to get sad about Johnny? This is an opportunity. I do not pay money to strangers. It also has its manager, Not married. You can change your manager. Not even you might get it. Loyalty to him is sacred, too dangerous. I'm tired of boxing, I should changing show. What do you do, bathe in it? At one time you liked. I stayed to eat. Do not wait for your dear Mrs. Harris. Jerry, let's be clear, you want money more than me. If I succeed, and I think I will, are you interested? Yes, I'm interested. Go ahead, do your work. I will. Have not come back? Not yet, Mr. Kelly, I'm waiting. He can not take too long. Do you know where? No, Mr. Kelly, do not know. Tell him that I called again. - Got a problem? - Shut up, ready. When do I get a fight? I'm starting to get tired of the gym. I do not know. And here I think than ever. These crazy. Still without reading the newspapers? Newspapers do not control boxing. We should return to the coast. Settle in Los Angeles. Get into the head I do not take orders. To me no one misses me here. I'm glad to know. But where is it? I see Miss Diamond. Not, really. Repeating it takes three days. - The wait here. - Hi, Kelly. If you're not home, where are you? I do not like people who lie. Do not be angry, Kelly, just wanted to be good to you. I told you I'm very expensive. I like nice things. And you can not buy. Do not have a job in this city. So why insist? Do you want to fire me? I explained the scenario. I told you to see Harris, that would solve. - But you do not receive orders. - I have a manager. You also have an appendix and that's not going to make you rich. Already a big boy, you have many expenses. With Harris would have it Johnny would have. I do not know the game to Haley, He picked me up from the street. Also I owe a lot of money. Wake up, Harris or back to the dump. - And I want sites taxi. - I can not. Then take off your license peddler. Midge, do it for your sake and for mine. Promise you will go to see Harris, just to see him. No. It never hurts to discuss things. Especially when there's money involved. Look, Midge, do not pretend convince you of anything. You need me and I you not. But with you there is some incentive. And that interests me. Beautiful view, right? The capital of the world. It will be all yours if you want. That little thing seems people from here. There are only two kinds of people in the world. Small and large. And rarely has occasion decide for yourself... ...Which one you want to be. You are ready, Midge. You're an ordinary boxer. One day you will have to pay up the last minute that passes in the ring. How are you going to end? Nobody can teach you anything about boxing,... ...Any ex-boxer will keep you fit. But if I'm your manager, take care your money, lay it right. You will not have to box when you get your decline. You left when you want and continue Lord calling you all your life. Think about it. You have to take the decision. Want to sign the check or not? Walker says that you to fight for the title. It's true. Yes? How do you know? Because I came and conquered, that's all. I did not want to return to the coast. Well, hats off. Not only that what you are going to remove. I thought you left with much. For what little you do for my 25 percent is too much. Did I hear correctly? You heard right. So you go with those. I've caught them by surprise. I thought we were... How much is too much? I do not know. Do not you know? What comes to be that nothing would be much. We talk about what you owe. I have, you more than you expect. Thank you. Did you read what it says Walker? What? Nothing, we are celebrating. Midge fight for the title and has found a new manager. - A blonde. - Stop it, Haley. Well, man, I'm going. What right had he to expect anything else? While this mob and I know I am old to swallow fairy tales. Do you know what a 'golem'? I had a feeling I was creating one. But it is something that I can. I'm crazy to see a good fighter in action. I've fired. It was necessary. Harris had to sign, was our salvation. How many years I have left? That's not an excuse. That man has been a father to you. I have fed you brought fame, you owe it everything. And has earned me a lot. Who They hit me or Haley? - Yuck counsel. - You leave this office. It is like the others, only that this is blood. Yes, I fired. Connie, do you think the world is full of angels? It's time to wake up. Listen, you, me and our mother. That's all that matters, nobody else. What happened to you? Have you anything gets in your way? First Emma, then Johnny Dunne and now Haley. You have your own methods destroy and I do not wish to support. Who forces you? Thank you, Midge, me you put a snap. Yes, go, stay by yourself. Find yourself a job, go with Haley. Do not worry about your brother. Not that, Midge, is not I could sleep at night... ...I thought when I was going to play me. Okay. What do you wear? Hi, Emma. I've been looking a long time. Why? I wanted to talk to you. Of what? Emma, do you remember me? The best washing the dishes. Finish at six. I've worked around. In shops, elevator. I've even been a model for a while. I have good guy in a bathing suit. I was looking to get rid of the plates and dirty glasses. And here I am. Do not you ever Lew? No. I think it's home. She loves to get rid of me. What do you, Connie? Why have you come? I have not yet asked Midge. I read the newspapers. Why not have asked for a divorce? I do not know. In this happy world, more loneliness than anything else. You can find alone in many places. In a dance, film,... ...In your room. That's funny. Sometimes a little enough gold to convince... ...That things are different than they are. What is it, Connie? Midge Want a divorce? Well, it does. I am not the messenger of Midge. I love you. I always loved you. And if in the place of Midge could not leave you. I come simply to ask come with me to Chicago,... ...To my mother. Why? He has many years and not well. You are the wife Midge, this is your place. There is enough money and you are entitled to it. But he does not like me. If you would like, is your only chance. Before or after you return home.

Palmer. I did not know it was woman's name also. Sorry, had danced never with a champion boxer. Hey, you are very strong. Sorry, I did not believe that the both were squeezing. I meant, dance very well. Do all boxers have as much pace? I do not know, I've never danced with anyone. What? Do I have a dirty face? I'm sorry, I was looking at? Yes. I have no idea to be the I saw the same man in the ring. I have said before that has a beautiful body. I would like to model it in clay. - Did you say to mud? - Yes, a bust. Or better yet, a figure full-length. Are you a sculptor? Only amateur. Will you pose for me? Convince. Yes, they seem to be in good shape. But the people what they want is to have muscles, not strength. Not at all. also in terms of force is no comparison. You do not want to pose like that, right? No, no. You have come early. Yes. And that chance? I've already said, anytime. Are we there yet? A few minutes more. I'm getting tired. Raise your head. - That's what makes me tired. - Shut up, please do not distract me. I dreamed of being distracted. How come you married Harris and you? Do not talk. I'll answer. My family told me we were ruined when you finish studying. I decided to dedicate the theater. And instead I married Jerry. He loves me and I will reciprocate. I have never regretted. You mean so far. You are very sure of yourself, right? Of course. What if I say to Jerry? Do not tell him. Enough for today. Great. How dare you? You're more real when you're angry. You have lived too time between statues. I fall in love easily, Midge. This I take it very seriously. I. How did you get here, Gracy? - Thank you for remembering my name. - Nothing, Gracy. Do not call me. What are you up to? What do you mean, Gracy, say Grace? Know too well. I know I of these striking, do not deny. You and the woman you are bundled Harris. Is that it? Scold me as if we were married. We are going to be and tomorrow is the best day to do so. Tomorrow, what a great idea. Tomorrow, why not? Tomorrow you have the same possibilities today. That is, no, because... ...Guess I'm already married. You lie. You think so? The next time you go to Chicago approach the 46 of Eagle Street. And if you find Mrs. Kelly there... ...I will marry you whenever you want. Not deceiving you, I'm not kidding. I've taken for a fool all the time. Honey, do not ask me if he was married. And after all, who cares? Do not have gone so wrong with me. I am committed to Harris to the ears. Where are you going? Out. I have an appointment with a lady. Do you know what a lady? No, impossible. Do you have knowledge of sculpture? You know anything about opera? No, you just know waste of money. To another, Grace, we'll see. I'm with you, do not think you're going to get rid of me. You bet. You left me once and I abandon you now. Forever. Start looking for another fool who support you. No, Midge, at first perhaps seek it, but not now. I swear, is the first time in my life. Please Midge, I'll do anything. Why not call Johnny Dunne? Well, dare. Make a fuss... ...That is to move the city. You'll sink. No, you're going to be a good girl,... ...Because if you do not send the hospital for a long time. I'll change. I do not want to see you when you leave. And now you sir, a great athlete... ...And a true champion, Midge Kelly. Thank you. I know I do not applaud me, but a sport we all want. I am proud of to be part... ...And that has helped me a lot. Thank you very much. Wonderful speech. Want to add something else? No. Do you think you go to Europe? Are you going to shoot a film? Nobody has proposed. What do you do to keep fit? Who will be the next fight? When you are faced with Johnny Dunne? Give me a break, I have argued my title four times this year. Yes, but what happens to Dunne? Whenever and wherever you want. Now I'm tired, I just fight a tough steak. ...where the great champion Midge Kelly just received... ...The highest sports award The Athlete of the Year award. champion and his manager have left the dais. There are already enough emotions tonight. Now rest, we'll talk tomorrow. May now come to me. I do not expect you so soon. Typically, it is now busier. Yet it is a good son. It has always been good. Right, Connie? Sure. Try to sleep, Mom. What is it, Emma? - I do not want to continue lying. - It's no lie. Sooner or later come. Yes, it's a lie. I'm not your mother, Connie. - Do not tell the date, but... - Connie, please. Do not treat me like a child. You have to convince you itself, although again,... ...Nothing will change for any of us. What do you mean? You know how I feel. I acknowledge that I had a long illness,... ...But I'm recovering. I think it was time. The explanation of my treatment I do not feel alone. I still love him, you know. Yes? I believe not. Love can not be add or remove at will. Is there a law that I can tell you not to grow? Should I wait to condemn Midge Kelly, back again or not? Do not you see? Fortunately I have seen that there are other people in the world. Wonderful people. Suppose you walked through that door now. Connie, told me once were no longer the messenger of Midge. It was also a lie. You suffer the same disease... ...And you have not yet healed. Wait a minute. I've been waiting a long time,... ...I do not blame you want to be sure. Can be. Is not it a strange appointment, Jerry? Maybe. Until the circumstances are. I want to talk quietly with you. I do not like being taken for a fool. I know about you and Kelly while. Really sorry. I should have said. Because it's not what you think. I'm going to marry him. Do not be stupid. Look, Palmer, I'm a little older than you. On the one hand is good and another bad. That gives me a certain degree of understanding. That man is not for you.

Yes, you've changed, you are now worse, you have been frozen blood. Outside, Connie. I have to rest. I finally reached my shift. As for Emma, once was not enough. You could not let her live in peace and happy? Why did you do? Why are you bored? You wanted to prove you're the champ? You suck! You reek of corruption! You're worse a grave robber! Come on. Ladies and gentlemen, as you will, of course,... ...The champion makes his entry into the stadium. Most of the spectators have risen. We welcome with enthusiasm.

And attacking from the first round without rest. The champion, meanwhile,... The bell rings, I leave you with Bill Brown. Thank you, Sam. Leave the two fast, without losing a moment. Please note, Kelly has a cut on the eyebrow. This can be crucial. Kelly Dunne hits after the bell, but apologizes. The champion, however, it fits well. Above all, both are athletes. I see Haley working Kelly eyebrow wound. The brow, Johnny. Punish him the eyebrow. The tide has turned definitely in this fight. Dunne, in my humble opinion, is has scored the last three rounds. And Kelly, with one eye covered, not respond as it should. It will produce a surprising result. Literally, you are doing Kelly pieces. I have not seen anything like it. I do not know why Kelly keeps up, if not outright anger. Of not being in the title game... ...The fight and would have interrupted while. It's over, you can not still fit hits.

Listen, Haley, those guys bellied with pure... ...No shoves at my expense. We tumbar, you know I can. Tommy, Tommy. Midge. I heard on the station. How are you? He is dead. Cerebral hemorrhage.
