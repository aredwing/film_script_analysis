And they have a plan. I was doing fine here. Thanks for exposing me. You weren't doing fine, thank goodness. If you'd wiped out this fleet, you'd have made us even more irredeemable in the eyes of our parents. No, I'd have proved us to be superior. No, no, see, I've figured out what went wrong. Well, that's a very useful revelation to have when you're standing in front of an airlock. Nonetheless... Our failure is obvious. We had our foot on the throat of humanity and we failed to step down hard enough. That was our error. Have you learned nothing in all this time in this fleet? Because I learned a great deal among the rebels on Caprica. Every killing of a human being was a grievous error. Do you want to know why? I really don't. Are you certain? Because it's fascinating. Listen, Brother, if you're right, that means this whole project was doomed from the beginning. Yes. From the very top. Dad. Mom. Dad. Mom. Dad. Our parents will be back with us soon. Of course, skin and veins and bones, they won't survive the death of the Colonies. Life among humans will have humbled them. When they resurrect, they'll return with apologies tumbling from their lips like jewels. Yes. Be prepared for some very sticky hugs. You know, I've got a yen to experience a nuclear holocaust in person. Perhaps with our dear mother here, I'll slide in another tub, and we can download side-by-side, after the bombs hit on Picon. Well, indulge yourself if you want. But I'll be on Caprica, making final arrangements with our contact. So if you're going to go, go soon. It may interest you to know that the final results of the CNP project are working close to 95% efficiency throughout the Fleet. Hold your applause, please. No applause for me? I doubt you would've ever completed the project without me. Yes. Well, you helped a bit. I rewrote half your algorithms. All right, you were extremely helpful, but let's not forget, you got something out of it. All that poking around inside the defense mainframe. It should give you a huge advantage bidding for the contract next year. You know that's not really why I did it. No. You did it 'cause you love me. I have to go. I'm meeting someone. Right. Really? Who is he? I'm insanely jealous. I doubt that. So touchy today. Well, as a matter of fact, I'm meeting someone, too. Business. A new project at Defense I might do, so... You'll call me later, right? It's about time. I wondered when you'd get here. Are you clear on the timing? Caprica City time. I recommend you leave this body behind. The alternative won't make for a very pleasant memory. Oh, and I hear that poison is really not that bad. You really like those olives, don't you? Maybe. Maybe I just like how I look reaching for them. Ellen Tigh. Bartender, let's have another one for the lady. Thank you. You're welcome. So, you don't have a name? I am a mysterious stranger. Ooh! Seized by God, they cry for succor in the dark of the light. Mists of dreams dribble on the nascent echo and love no more. Jump. And why are you here, Ellen? I mean, you're so obviously intended for greater things. Are you a priest? Would it matter? You're up. Counting down. All functions nominal. All functions optimal. Counting down. The center holds. The falcon hears the falconer. Infrastructure, check. Wetware, check. Everyone hang on to the life bar, please. Help? Anybody wanna save the lady? I'll save you, baby. Apotheosis was the beginning before the beginning. Devices on alert. Observe the procedures of a general alert. The base and the pinnacle. The flower inside the fruit that is both its parent and its child. Decadent as ancestors. The portal and that which passes. No. No, don't sweat it. I'll make the flight. You gonna have enough time? Yes. They run Delphi to C City every hour now. Nuclear devices activated, and the machine keeps pushing time through the cogs, like paste into strings into paste again, and only the machine keeps using time to make time to make time. And when the machine stops, time was an illusion that we created. Free will, 12 battles, three stars, and yet we are countless as the bodies in which we dwell, are both parent and infinite children in perfect copies. No degradation. Oh, now, now, don't tense up, Mysterious. I'm just saying there's no point in judging anybody. No one changes who they really are. If no one is corrected, then no one learns their lessons. Well, I've lived in this world a long time, and I'm proud to say that I haven't learned any godsdamn lessons. The makers of the makers fall before the child. Accessing defense system. Handshake, handshake. Second level clear. It's begun. Caprica Control, Yashuman. Heavy bogeys, six plus, lower orbit, over grid 15-2. No joy, Yashuman. Then go to your window and look up. They're big as frakking asteroids. Copy, Yashuman. Still blind. Got some kind of system-wide crash in the defense grid. Try to unfrak yourself right godsdamned now, 'cause we got multiple inbound, and they're not carrying flowers. Wait one, Yashuman. We don't have one left. Accepting scan. Love outlasts death. I'm going hot. Blue leader, do you read me? Blue leader, come back. I got no radio contact. I'm down, too. It's like somebody pulled the plug. We're adrift. Their ships fail. Skittering like... It's been a long time coming. ...is meaningless in the absence of time. What never was is never again. I bet they don't understand what we're doing for them. I think they're grateful in their own way. I know I'd be. Nice. That is beautiful. Yeah. What you gonna do now, Sam? Shoot till I can't, Coach. If you let someone change you or make you apologize, then you're selling yourself out, you know. Oh, and remember to get Jeremy to check the numbers on mayoral staff downtime. Start it up. Coach! You gotta be kidding me! If we find a project whose cost is... You win, Coach. I'm going down. This has happened before. Look. Here we go. Move. Progress reports arriving. The farms of Aerilon are burning. The beaches of Canceron are burning. The plains of Leonis are burning. The jungles of Scorpia are burning. The pastures of Tauron are burning. The harbors of Picon are burning. The cities of Caprica are burning. The oceans of Aquaria are burning. The courthouses of Libran are burning. The forests of Virgon are burning. The Colonies of Man lie trampled at our feet. What have we got? Shipping accident? Combat? Understood. Condition one is set. All decks report ready for action, sir. This is a joke. The Fleet's playing a joke on you. It's a prank. Come on. I don't think so. We just felt another blast here. If anyone can still hear me, are we on? I'm gonna keep broadcasting as long as I can. It keeps getting closer... Oh, Gods, is this really happening? I got family in the city. I gotta go find them. Are you frakking nuts? The city's gone. I don't care. No, it's not safe! - Nobody's going anywhere! We don't know enough, okay? We can't lose our frakking heads, all right? We gotta find some place we can get a perspective on this thing. If we go anywhere, we go together, and we go when it's safe, is that understood? This has happened before. Oh, Gods, am I gonna die? No. No, your suffering isn't over yet. Not when you've got so much left to learn. What? This is the Commander. Moments ago, this ship received word of a Cylon attack against our homeworlds is underway. We do not know the size or the disposition or the strength of the enemy forces. But all indications point to a massive assault against Colonial defenses. How, why, doesn't really matter now. What does matter is that, as of this moment, we are at war. You've trained for this. You're ready for this. Stand to your duties, trust your fellow shipmates, and we'll all get through this. All right, people, this is what we do. We're the best, so let's get the old girl ready to roll, and kick some Cylon ass! Come on! Let's go! Move! This better be for real. Stay down, stay down, stay down. What's going on over there? What is that? Is it the Cylons? Everybody, stay down, stay down. Everybody, stay down. What is it? What is it, T? Oh, my Gods. What do you see? It is the Cylons. They're guarding some kind of container. What do you wanna do, Coach? I don't know. What do you think? I don't know. We can't stay here. We gotta go. Everybody, stay low, stay fast. Let's go. All right, ladies and gentlemen, come on out. You're safe now. Come on, we'll get you cleaned up. Thank you. Ma'am. Excuse me, my husband, he's in the Colonial Fleet on Gemenon. Your husband's in the Colonial Fleet? Where is he? I don't know, ma'am. Could you step right this way? We'll do our best, ma'am. Basestar is launching Raiders. Cylons are chasing the Fleet. Who are you? Every 33 minutes, they come back. Raiders diving out of the light like bats. Please, find Saul. Dear Papa. He's here. Of the five that created all the rest of us, four are in this fleet. Only Father Sam is missing. It's amazing. Does it seem cruel that I'm keeping you alive? It is cruel. Who am I kidding? But it's also necessary. For 30 years, you failed to observe the moral failures of humanity, against whom you find me lacking. Get better, Mother. Open your eyes and take a gander at what you think you love. Okay. We've all seen the Centurions gathering the body parts of other Centurions when they get destroyed, right? You've seen them take them to those weird containers they dropped. Probably repair sheds where they patch up everything we do to them. Does anybody remember that old war movie, The Tauron Line? What they did? Those were the bad guys. Doesn't matter. We can still make this thing work. Some of you guys brought us some pretty fine things that go boom, right? We can take a Centurion, something, and rig it to blow. They take it back to the shop, it blows up inside, no more shop. No, no. That sounds dangerous. Well, yeah, you know, it is dangerous, but breathing's dangerous. Look, there's a really strong possibility that we're all gonna die here. So I say it comes down to how we're gonna die. Well, how do we get a Centurion body part? What the hell is that? It's a thigh. This turns it around. Right there. Right now, we're only accepting photos of missing people. If there is a confirmed death, hang onto the picture for later. They're awful quiet. They're numb. They've lost everything and now we're putting them through the wringer, just trying to get away. You're right. This calm won't last. Excuse me. Oh, pardon me, Brother. Thank you for your help. Take one, my child. Thank you, Brother. Excuse me, I wonder if... Sorry, sir. If you're looking to be billeted on Galactica, it's just not possible. No, no. I've been afforded a chapel. I just wanted to post these flyers in the restricted area. Can I take a peek? Well, how about I post them for you? Fine, thank you very much. Very kind of you, son. Have you read through this? It says there's a plan, right? Welcome. I see we don't have a Three or a Four here. That's interesting. I thought I saw a Four. What's the plan? The plan is everything blows up a week ago. All the humans are dead, and we Cylons all download, and the universe basks in justice. However... It didn't frakking happen. Exactly. So it's up to us. We can all get weapons, work separately. Oh, there's a proposal on the table. Over 10,000 victims each. We'll be busy. We can't do this on a case-by-case basis. Which is why we have to take out Galactica. With it gone, the Fleet's dead. We also have to think defensively. Avoid threats to our detection. Very good, Sixes. Now I have assignments I'm gonna give to each of you, along with our sleeper agent. There's a sleeper agent? Yes. An Eight. I'll talk to her. Now, Two, you come with me. Let's get this genocide started. Stay low. Bring it in. I'd very much like to be able to communicate with a Baseship next time we're near one, and it might be amusing to listen to the human military, as well. Military are good about scrambling their signals. The military built the Centurions. Functional, but hardly miraculous. Crack their technology. And send in a Six. Dealer's choice. What is that? Something I'm trying. Explosives in a Pyramid ball with a detonator. Like a homemade grenade. Holy frak. It took it. It's headed your way. All right, everybody. Get ready. - Let him get inside. - I know, Jean. I must say, you Sixes are doing a great job differentiating yourselves. Love the look. But it doesn't do any good if there's a mechanism out there that can sniff us out. You mean Dr. Baltar's machine. If we destroyed it, he'd just make another. That's why we have to discredit him. Me? Well, if he sees one of us, he'll know what we are. But he can't say anything without saying how he knows. Very smart. Or maybe it's the glasses. Anyway, carry on, and send in the Five, please. Come on, you metal moron, go inside. Let's take out all those supplies. Anders, it's open. We got to get out of here. They're coming back. Look, the door's open a little. We could pry it and... Let's finish this. No. Hey, no! Come on. Coach, no! Get back here! Coach, no! Coach! Whoa! What the frak was in there? No. No. No! Incoming! - We got birds! - Hit the dirt! I can't leave them out there. No! I can't leave them out there! They're coming back. We are all gonna die if we don't move. - Let's go! - Go! Move! Move! Move, move, move. Everybody back. Let's go. Move out, move out, move out. Yes, but Fives in general haven't been that impressive thus far. One of your counterparts managed to get himself outed back on Ragnar Station. I can't understand how he was discovered. I heard it was Dr. Baltar. Well, no. I'm not talking about that, exactly. I'm talking about the fact that you're walking around this fleet wearing that jacket, and, more importantly, that face. You're recognizable. His jacket was burgundy. This is teal. Well, I have something else for you to wear, Five. Yes. They call this a suicide vest, but I think that undersells all the homicide that goes along with it, don't you? T. Are you okay? You know, even robots take their dead. There was nothing... I don't know what I'm doing! We need you. Please. Starbuck, Galactica. You have three enemy contacts identified as fighters. Copy that, Galactica. All right, listen up. Stay with your wingmen, keep your interval and remember your training. On my mark, kick in your burners. Three, two, one, mark. All right, here they come. Ready, break. Keep it together. All right, that's two down. Where's their buddy? Hey. This is a chapel, not a bus station. You can't sleep here. Hey, whoa. You're gonna kill yourself. Here, let me, let me. I got it, I got it. I got it, I got it. Thanks. I'm swapping out the oxygen cylinders on Raptor 702. I checked 702 yesterday. Life support's fine. Until two weeks ago, I used to inspect the aircraft for Sun Airways. If I found cylinders in that condition, you'd be looking at a shutdown. All right. Well, grab the spares. There are no spares. Welcome to the Galactica. Uh... Lieutenant Valerii, this is Giana O'Neill. A new knuckle dragger. Great, we could use the help. Yes. You could. Do you need to see me for something, Lieutenant? No, I'm... Carry on, Chief. So how long have you two been seeing each other? Excuse me? I've seen office romances before. My old job was full of them. Believe me. Like you and your husband? No. He's a medic in the Colonial Fleet. At least he used to be. Our romance had different obstacles. There's always something. Well, I wouldn't know anything about that. You're gonna do fine. I know it. Well, I'm glad you do, because I feel like I'm gonna die or something. Well, in a way, you are. But when you wake up, you're gonna begin a whole new life. A human life with a human name. Sharon Valerii. Water? Trust me, it'll disable the Fleet. Someone just has to get in there and attach explosives to the tank. All right. Do it as soon as possible. And after you download, remember to report the position of the Fleet. Wait, wait, I'm not sure that I'm... My cover. It's stronger than expected, and there are some people onboard Galactica that have a hold on me. Chief Tyrol loves me. Chief Tyrol? That's an interesting human to choose among all humans. You're a machine, Eight. Go get some explosives, blow up the tank, and then have a fatal accident. Right now, I'm late for dinner. Let's thank the Gods. Yes. Yes, let's thank the Gods. Thank you, Lords of Kobol, for uniting our family in the midst of great tragedy. We pray. Well, so it is you. I thought I recognized you from the other day. How come you didn't stop by? Hello. I'm Brother Cavil. Hello. Honey, Brother Cavil was my childhood priest. Is this your family? Hmm? I'm Giana O'Neill, Simon's wife. This is Jemmy, from my first marriage. I don't think I've ever met anyone from Simon's childhood. Please, sit down. Oh, I'm sure we'd have loads to talk about, but I'm so busy right now, you can't imagine. Stop by sometime. And remember, I know where you live. I didn't think it would be so hot and dirty. The smell is... I know. The Centurions should be doing this. They're all alike. T, they've gotta be Cylons. Frakkers look like us now. Listen to me. We have to get out of here, okay? You need to be very quiet. Okay? All right. Just follow me out. Here we go. Come on, come on, come on. I was underwater and I started to lose it. And to lose who I am. I didn't know where I was and... I started to panic and I tried to breathe. We shouldn't need to breathe. I'm not sure. I'm not sure if we should detonate the charges. I mean, these humans, there are so few of them. They're no threat. They are manifestly a threat. They're a threat because of the power they have to make you do this. Of all Cylons, you should see that. Now, you really ought to get out of those wet clothes. Fine. Be a prude. Someone's obviously setting you up to take the fall for something. That's what it is. You wake up somewhere, you don't know how you got there or anything. You're drugged, or manipulated, or who knows what. Something. What do we do? Because if I report what's happened, they're gonna think I'm a Cylon agent. No, they're not. No, no, they're not. Why would they think that? That's crazy. People are getting crazy, okay? You heard the rumors. Cylons who look like humans, sleeper agents hiding in the Fleet. Decompression alarm! Motherfrakkers! There's one more! Help! Somebody help me! We got a survivor. Security, XO. Send an armed detail to meet me in the midpoint promenade deck causeway, C level. Approach from aft. Repeat, approach from aft. Doral! ...tell us if you've seen anybody who matches this description? Does he look familiar to you? Have you seen this man? Yeah, just saw him. You sure? Yeah. Let's go. Roger. Good job. You know, there are those who think this current devastation is punishment for man's sins. Is that what you believe, Brother? I don't believe it's punishment from the Gods, no. But perhaps... Perhaps the Cylons have assumed the role that the Gods once had. That's a pretty trippy thought. Yeah, well, they're smiting us pretty well, and there's certainly an abundance of sins to judge. Do you, you know, hear confessions? I can, of course. Yes, I can. Good. We'll talk later. All right. All right. Doc, this is Brother Cavil. This is our team doctor. Welcome, Brother. I'm very glad to see you. Very glad. Glad to see you, too. Maybe a man of the Gods will bring us some luck around here, eh? Yeah. After you. Four, you're late. It was hard to get away. Oh. Yes, I found a Three with a similar problem. I let her pursue her path. But you... Oh, did you happen to hear about the courageous Five that wore an explosive vest into the corridors of Galactica recently? I'm a medic. There are other things that I can do. Oh, yes. The serial-killer option. That's a fine, fine option. But, tell me, are you reluctant to do more for your people? Like what? I'm just asking a general question. This is all improv, isn't it? You're scared, you're outmanned. You're surrounded by humans who weren't supposed to be alive in the first place. No one was supposed to be alive! Our people were supposed to be positioned to cause destruction, not mop up afterwards. My Two was the Defense Minister's yoga instructor, if you can believe that, and one of the Sixes was a prostitute. But the only one in a position to do any frakking damage was a Five on this ship, and he frakked it up! Now, the universe still has these cockroaches in it, and we can't have any peace until we step on them all. And don't you think for a moment that I'm gonna be moved by the sweet, adorable fact that you married one of them. You come back tomorrow, and we'll talk about you blowing up that ship you live on. You're the one who let the Cylons into the defense mainframe. You betrayed your colony, your home, your entire race. You're the man responsible for the Holocaust and I'm here to see that you're exposed and sentenced to death as the traitor you really are. There's also this. - What the frak's that? On the disk is a photo. It was captured from the security camera in the defense mainframe on Caprica. It shows the doctor entering the mainframe without permission the day before the attack. As you can see, the man in the photo is carrying an explosive device. Sorry, he's what? - I'm hit! - I got you, Hot Dog! We're going to make it through this. Break right. Now! Now! Now! Frak! I just lost all three mains. It's all right, Hot Dog. You did good. You're gonna be okay, I promise you. At least one of us will. Frak! I just lost all three mains. It's all right, Hot Dog. You did good. You're gonna be okay, I promise you. At least one of us will. I think I'm losing it. Honestly, I think we both knew that. Someone wrote "Cylon" on my mirror, and I think it was me. You think it was you? I think I was trying to warn myself, or scare myself into doing what you want, or out of it. One old man. He's like a father to me. He is your father. All mankind are our fathers. And that's the sin for which they deserve to die. I'm happier when I'm under. I'm happier when I'm human. I like myself. I love myself then. Never say that. Never, never, never. Because if that were true, they win. And they can't. Look at me. Look at me. They know your lies. I know you. You can do this. You can kill Adama. For me. What the hell do you think you're doing? I want answers, and I want them now! And I am not interested in playing any more of your stupid games! Excuse me. You're a fake. You're just a copy. Another Cylon copy. Get out. Struck a nerve, have I? Which I find rather impossible to believe! You think this is over? This is not over! You have not heard the last. No more Mr. Nice Gaius! I'm telling you, she flew a Raider. Learned how to control it from the inside. Nobody taught her how. Kara Thrace plucked that knowledge from the stream... I don't care if she plucked puppies from God's ass! You're worse than the frakking Sixes. She has a destiny. Something beyond us. I'm starting to understand why God loved humankind before he changed his mind. No, no, no, no. If you get a chance, you kill her. But right now, you've got other problems. Take him to the Brig. He's under arrest for supplying information to the enemy. I would like to speak to my attorney. Can't I speak to my attorney? You've been here a week, One. That's all I'm saying. Well, my methods are hardly slower than yours, Four. Contaminating meds, giving too much morpha. You said you could contact the others with this location and take them out in a strike. Well, the thing is, I promised to hear his confession, and we men of the Gods keep our promises. Good. Looks good. Now, hold on, wait. Okay, go, go. How'd she get so far ahead? Frak! Open the door. Yes, sir. Wait. I haven't even had a trial yet. No! Wait! It's a lie! Doctor, it's all right. It's a lie. The photograph was a fake. What? It was almost seamless, but your face, the man, the reflection, it was all a fake. I went back, I re-ran all the security checks. This time I found markers which pointed to photo manipulation. They weren't apparent until the photo was fully resolved. Thank you. It was really nothing, Doctor. Once the photos were fully resolved, it was almost too easy, like she wanted to be found out. Excuse us. Excuse us. Will the other Six be okay? She's fast. She's almost beyond human. How did she get off of the ship? Got me. There's been no ships coming or going. I gave you an order. I had two Marines tailing her. They say they went around a corner and she was gone. Every ship in the Fleet has reported in, sir. There's no sign of her. That's unacceptable. She was here. She was right here. This woman existed. She didn't just vanish. Have them check again. Every ship? Every ship, including this one. She didn't just vanish. Is Baltar's machine on the trash heap? I did what I could. I don't know. Trying to make a guilty man look guilty. It should be so easy. We had to fake the evidence. Baltar, he helped us so much on Caprica... Are you attracted to this human? No. 'Cause the other Six got addicted to him. I'm not addicted! Baltar's a brilliant man, yes, but you should've seen me. I was brutal with him. I pushed him. You pushed him. My dear, if you pushed him, you would have sent him through a wall. Oh, look. An airlock. How handy. Wait. I could blend into life on another ship. With another disguise. Go. And don't forget to give them our coordinates. I want this finished. Love? You don't even know what the word means. I see the truths that float past you in the stream. You have a real thing about rivers and streams, don't you? I think we should indulge you in your obsession. Do you realize I could kill you before they came back in the room? I could get to my feet, rip your skull from your spinal column, crash through that door, kill the guard in less time than it has taken me to describe it to you. Then why don't you? It's not the time. Surprise, you're dead. Gods. Are you a war orphan? No. So you have parents. Do they want you? No. Well, two decks below, there's a room, and there's people in that room that are in charge of children that nobody wants. All right, don't go there. But go somewhere. How are you feeling? It looks worse than it is, sir. Things are moving very quickly and I need every pilot. I'm ready, sir. I have a very special mission for you and I won't kid around. It's high risk, extremely high risk. I need you to nuke a Cylon Basestar. Yes, sir. You're late. She's already down. Sorry. Where were you? The Chief had us running tests on the Cylon Raider. Oh, yeah. Right. It's the strangest thing. Half alive. Wow. What? What? What's up with you? Nothing. Nothing. It's just that... We just barely escaped with our lives and it seems like we ought to be living them. Don't you think? Not working all night. Ignoring the child. Is that why we escaped, so you can be a frakking mechanic? Grease under your nails. Look at them. You wanna touch your daughter with these hands, baby? Does it really matter? You know I miss how things were. I hate this jumpsuit. But everyone's doing what they can. You woke her up. That's good. That's very, very good. Why waste time sleeping? There's an entire race of Cylons out there trying to rip out our frakking throats. We need to spend every moment that we can living. Right? Come on, dance with me. Come on, come on. Baby... Stay away from her. Are you drunk? For Gods' sake, what's wrong with you? Pull yourself together! Where you going? Where you going? Giana? Baby, where you going? Baby, come back! Daddy! Come here! Clearing the blast radius of the Basestar. Explosion imminent. Hey, nice work. Thanks. What's going on? A lot happened while you were gone. Thanks. Congratulations to both of you. You carried out a very difficult and dangerous mission, and you did it despite any personal misgivings you may or may not have had. And for that, I'm very proud. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Shot fired! Shot fired! Dad! Get a doctor in here, pronto. Dad. Dad. Come on. Is he dead? If he's not dead, he's dying. Thus is the beast decapitated. Which inspired you to come and tell me... I'll do it. Okay? I'll blow up my ship. I will blow up the Cybele. Good, very good. Now we've got a bit of traction. I'll tell you what you need to do. One condition. I want my family kept safe. No. You don't want that. You see, if they die now, they'll die without ever knowing what you are. Who was that? That was the Four. Oh. And Boomer shot the Commander. Things are looking up. They'd have to. Move your arm. There's not much more down they could go. The Six failed, the Two failed. Every machine needs to warm up. We're a fleet-killing machine. We just started to hum. "We just started to hum"? I'll make you hum. Oh, yeah. Hum. You shot him. But you didn't kill him. You didn't kill him. And things were finally going well. What do you want from me? I shot him twice in the chest. How about once in the head? Did you think of that? I told you, I'm not in control. The only way that I could get this done was to turn myself into a Centurion. I could feel my skin turning hard. I could feel the bullets moving through the channels under my hard metal skin. I couldn't feel my heartbeat. Sounds wonderful. If there was any part of us that's human, in that moment, I killed that. Yes, good. That's the idea. Now listen, Eight, I need you, and I need to break a string of failures. I lost the best part of myself. Yes. All right. I see how this is. Goodbye, Eight, and good luck. I don't want a priest. And you deserve no absolution. Now we've got to figure out where the hell we are. What did you find out? I think I've seen them before. Another one of her and maybe him. Skin jobs, then. It seems likely. I can't swear to it, my memory is... What are we waiting for? Let's go. Yeah, all right. Listen, you two, you hold back here. Do not move. The rest of the team, you form up on me. Let's move out. Who is it? Some random humans. Each side is gonna suspect the other. I wish I could watch. Uh-uh. Hi. So, somebody might get shot. Great. You were the one telling me how swift and terrible this whole thing was gonna be. It's been two months since those bombs fell. And you're helping a resistance cell thrive here. Bitch! Traitor! I love you, Chief. I'm sorry. I really am sorry. I love you. You want a progress report? I'll give you a frakking progress report. Oh, no, please don't. Please don't. Oh, come on, it is spectacular. Doral blew himself up, causing minor damage to a minor hallway. And Boomer jettisoned the water, and then, she personally found loads more water. And then she shot Adama, but not very accurately, since she loved him. And then, Leoben, he got obsessed with Kara Thrace, and then was captured and air-locked. And my sister Six utterly failed to discredit Baltar and his dreamy hair and destroyed our frakking cover in the process. And now Simon... Simon killed himself, really killed himself, out of resurrection range, without blowing up the ship that he lived on, because he couldn't imagine life without his little human wife and his little human daughter, because he loves them... Stop, stop, stop. Guess I better. Yes. They're all letting me down. Why are they letting you down, One? What's the x-factor? Can't declare war on love. I think I already did. Hey, where did the bottle go? Some of the electronics involved in overriding airlock security are pretty sophisticated. Colonel, you said this wasn't gonna be an interrogation. This is why I wanted to come. This isn't an interrogation, but it is an investigation. Do you think he was a Cylon because he killed himself? We could use more Cylons like that, huh? Chief, don't. I never said Cylon. Good. Sir, I don't know how he knew how to rig an airlock, but he was a smart man. He learned it somewhere. Some people would cry murder if their husband or wife died like that. I could understand that, but... He left a note. "Love outlasts death." We really did just want some answers. No one thinks that your husband was a Cylon. Yes, sir. Of course, sir. May I have that back? You want some advice? You're on the losing end of this fight. Give it up before you all die. Head further up in the mountains... I hear the new woman's voice. Kara Thrace. And what? Wait to die? As soon as I get back to Galactica, I'll send a rescue party. Yeah, right. If I say I'm gonna do something, I do it. You always such a bitch in the morning? Count on it. My kind of woman. So weak. I thought he was supposed to kill her in the woods. He's a bad shot. Did she see you? No. No, I stayed out of sight. Good. She got a glimpse of me, but she didn't react. So, if there's a One up in that fleet, she didn't see him. At least not enough to ring a bell in her tiny brain. What are they doing? You need a doctor to tell you that? Oh, for God's sake, why? Why? He loves her. He loves her? Vigorously. But she's beneath him. Not necessarily. Would you quit making jokes, for frak's sake? This is wrong. Don't you Fours have a little place, a... What do you call it? A ranch? No. A farm? Are you hurt? - What's wrong? I feel fine, just help her. What happened? I don't know! We just... We got ambushed, okay? They overran us. They grabbed Sue-Shaun, and Kara was... Godsdamn, if something happened... I thought she was with us. I suppose they killed her. We gotta go back. I'm going after them. Helo! He should let her go. Hey, kid! Sit down. You've been up all night? Yeah, I guess so. Seems like I never sleep anymore. I know the feeling. Frak, if you're looking for a strong leader, you picked a bad time. Bless me, Brother, for I have acted against the example of the Gods. Proceed in the name of the Gods. At the very beginning of this, they wanted to give me all this responsibility and I didn't want it. Just wanted to get out of it. You know, wanted to leave. And one time, I tried. It was just after this thing we did. I was so frakked up. I took this stupid idea from a movie. People died, I couldn't handle it. I wanted to run. I just wanted to get out. But you changed your mind. Well, no. Barolay was there and she was gonna see me run. And suddenly I find myself worrying about my own frakking reputation. So, I didn't run. And that's my confession. I'm a godsdamn coward, Brother. Well, I suppose you were. But what about now? I'm not gonna run anymore. Maybe I'm stronger or maybe I'm just more insane. This whole experience has changed you for the better. You've learned. You know, at the end of a confession, sometimes there's an ending or, you know... Yes, fine. You are absolved in the example of the Gods. Now, Sam, listen, given that this holocaust was a journey of learning for you... Journey? I don't know if it was a journey... Well, given that, it can... Can you forgive the Cylons? Because if you can, that's really transcendent. I know you didn't just say that. I mean, they must've had a purpose. Something must've made them... Made them what? End everything? Destroy billions of souls? No, frak, no. Humanity had so much sin. Are you kidding me? They made you put all these dead... Wait a second. ...on your shoulders. Are you defending them? Listen, Brother, I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that, okay? I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear any of that. What was that? I thought he'd learned. But he loves. What are you really doing here? What does this man mean to you? Where are you going? As long as any humans exist, there's no room for us. Good morning! Kara, come on! Go, go, go! Barolay, get back to camp. Doc's a Cylon, take him out. I'm Brother Cavil. I understand you've asked for religious counseling. I never really believed in psychotherapy. My father was a priest. I see. You thought you'd have an easier time with a priest than a real doctor. Okay. So, tell me what's on your mind, Chief. How do you know that I am human? You heard what Kara Thrace said? Yeah, I heard. Picture of a Pyramid star and their frakking team doctor. My husband, only not. He was a Cylon. I thought he loved me. Gods. Maybe he did. I don't know. Someone made him do it. Don't you think? I mean, they keep finding more of them, and they must've been in contact. Someone was making decisions. You think that somebody told them what to do. Ordered them. I think Simon was told to do something and instead he killed himself. Boomer was a better shot than that. What? When she shot the old man. She was a better shot than that. It's like she frakked it up on purpose, knowing that the Marines would take her head off right then and there, knowing that it was the only way out she could see. So, maybe they were heroes, you know? In a way. I don't know about that. Maybe. If I thought I was a Cylon, I'd climb this ladder all the way up there. I'd do it with style. I'd swan-dive out of this life. Sorry. I didn't mean anything by that. I know. You think you're a Cylon. That's what you're afraid of, isn't it? That you might be a Cylon and not even know it, just like Boomer, right? That's the thought that's crippling your soul. Does that frighten you? The idea of putting your trust in others? Honestly, yes. Yeah, well, I've done it. And they all let me down. Every single one. Every single one. So, yeah, it should scare the frak out of you. But good luck to you. This is quite a scrappy little group. Just your core people. This is quite a scrappy little group. Just your core people. There's hardly anyone left for you to lean on. But you can lean on me. You know, the day before I met Kara, I had 98 people. I loved those people. But you didn't need them and they're dead. Do you mean to tell me that you'd go on loving them even when they're dead? What are you talking about? Of course I love those people. Death doesn't change that. What's the matter with you? Keep it the hell down. Word's getting passed back, something's there. Move forward, stay low. All right, stay low, move in. Go, go, go, go, go. You got a Samuel T. Anders there? Is there a Kara Thrace there? Who wants to know? If there is, you tell her she took her good sweet time getting here. Friendlies. What's your name? John. We've become friends, huh? Friends are dangerous things. Death doesn't change that. What's the matter with you? As good as your word, huh? Yeah, good as my frakking word. What, did you think I was gonna leave you here? Now you feel like a big frakking idiot, don't you? All right, just shut up and save us already, okay? Okay. Incoming! Come on, get in there. Come on, get in here. Get him up, get him up. Can't raise the Raptors. Cylons are jamming the freqs. Frak! Are they still out there? Watch yourself. Yeah. They're holding back, though. Yeah, but why? That's an excellent question. Get the frak out of the way. What's going on? Why the ceasefire? There's been a vote. A vote? There's going to be a truce. We just need to convey it to the humans. All of them. I can deliver that message. But your model voted against it. Well, I've had a new insight. Besides, there's nothing for me here. Commander, I have news. Good news, actually. The Cylon occupation is over. They left. They're gone. What are you talking about? It's true. The Cylons have left the Colonies. Security! What the hell? Code Blue! He's a Cylon. Would you mind telling me what's going on? I'm not a frakking Cylon. I'm not... Oh. Well. Okay, then. Sorry to bust up your day, Brother, but there's been a change of plan. The occupation of the Colonies was an error. My mission here is simple. I'm to tell you that you've been given a reprieve. Cylon and man will now go their separate ways. No harm done. No harm? You completely annihilated our race and destroyed our civilization. Now, if you're gonna start pointing fingers... You see, we're not like you. We can admit our mistakes, and we're not afraid of change. New marching orders by your one true god? There is no god. Supernatural divinities are the primitive's answer for why the sun goes down at night. At least that's what we've been telling the others for years. We can't really prove it one way or the other, of course. Enough. Let's airlock them both. Airlock them. Hold it at the door. Yes, sir. Check the hall. Stop. Stop. Sweep the halls. Clear up ahead, there are too many civilians. Not how I imagined it. No, Brother. All right. Is there a Resurrection ship in range? Yes, Brother. But first, we're gonna die in a vacuum. There's a 170-foot launch tube in front of us. We might die of our injuries before we get to the vacuum. I don't like you. I understand that. Do you really believe it was a mistake to attack the humans? Rather intensely, yes. You know that when we download among the others, your strange ideas will be shouted down. Ideas only seem strange until you try them on, Brother. We had a temper tantrum in the form of a cataclysm because we wanted them to treasure us, the Ones, more than humanity. More than their own history and blood. We didn't want to be loved. We wanted to be treated fairly. We wanted to be held to a bosom, to be petted and perfumed and told we were the princes of the universe. Yes, well, if the humans were gone... Our parents would mourn them. They'd love them more, anyway. I am going to see to it that you get boxed. And then I'm going to prepare to wipe out humanity once and for all. The anticipation is really unpleasant. Yes. I don't want to be human! I want to see gamma rays. I want to hear x-rays, and I want to... I want to smell dark matter. I want to reach out with something other than these prehensile paws and feel the solar wind of a supernova flowing over me. I'm a machine, and I could know much more.
