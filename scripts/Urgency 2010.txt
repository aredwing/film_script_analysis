Come on. - No, I can't. - I'm gonna be late. - Mmm. Can you at least stay for breakfast? - No. - Please? I can't. I'll call you if I'm running late, okay? - Okay. - I love you. I love you. Bye. Anthony? I'm in here, baby. So, I can't get you to stay? What if I, uh-- What if I wrote a note, like in school, and I said, "Dear Edward, please excuse Anthony from his meeting today because his wife never gets a chance to see him"? Come on. Can you stay for another half an hour, hmm? Please? I'll make it really quick. You never make it really quick. - Come on. - I can't, baby. Come on. It's a big day. I know what today is. Zeffert sent me this file. It's so big I can't even download it. I don't understand. If he would've just handed it to me, I would've read it by now. I thought technology was supposed to help us instead of slow things down. Oh, that reminds me. Something came for you by ZepEx. - I put it in your briefcase. - Thank you. Mm-hmm. The whole thing crashed. I don't have time for this. Okay, go. I'll take care of it. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Thank you. - Okay. Look, I know-- I know, uh, this isn't ideal, all right? But I love you, and I'll make it up to you tonight. Okay. I love you. Perfect. Hey, that's great. Great start. Fantastic. Great. Hey. Hey, Sumner. - Oh, hey. - Hey. Hey. - Hey. - Yeah. How are you? Good. Good. Good. What do you think of the, uh... - Looks great. Great. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Sprinklers are just giving me hell. You know, I have to rotate them, like, every hour. - Can't get somebody out here, huh? - No. Hey, um, what do you think of the turtle? It's, um-- Yeah. Yeah, I like the beads. - It's Christmas. - Yeah. You know, I figure if my ex-wife ever stops by, she'll be, uh, impressed. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. - It's just this-- this-- this whole-- - It'll be fine. ...separation thing is just-- It'll work itself out. - Really? - It'll be okay. Okay. So, did you guys ever figure out - No. No. - ...that job thing? Uh, the network specialist, uh, position? I'll check on that again today. Yeah. I really appreciate it. - Don't even worry about it. - Okay. So, uh-- - Don't even worry. - I'll see you tonight then. - All right. Yeah-- No-- I gotta go. - Yeah, me, too. Edward called for some ZHP file. He wants it back. From what I can gather is, Zeffert borrowed it on Friday but never returned it. Security said he stopped by over the weekend, but, uh, nobody can get ahold of him. - Call him at home? - Yep, and his cell. I've left several messages. - That's not like him at all. - Mm-mmm. It's weird. Today's the buyout. And? What? And what? Your anniversary. Oh, my-- Oh, my God. Today's my anniversary. - Yeah. - I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I forgot to-- Uh, uh, send-- Oh, my God. Send flowers to the house, - like, now, if you could. - Okay. Done. Baby, come on. That's not fair. It's not every night. That's-- It-- It's now. It's because of the buyout. Oh, it's the buyout, and before that, it was the gene therapy launch, and before that... I mean, it's always something. What happened to our plans? Baby, what are you talking about? This is our plan. This-- This is-- This is the plan. We pay Edward back, and we-- and we start our family. Look, I messed up with the-- with the anniversary. I know. I get it. And I love you, and I'm sorry, but I... Listen, nothing-- nothing's changed. It's hard to start a family when you're never home. You're always working. I know. I know. Tony, I love you, and I don't wanna complain, but I need a little bit more of you. Okay. Baby, please come home. Baby, come on. Edward's-- Edward's not gonna just let me leave. You know what? This is about us, okay? And when something's really important to you-- I know you-- you don't let anything stand in your way. So why should our marriage be any different? Thank you, Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Britney. - Good morning, Mr. Garcia. - Morning, Janet. Is he in? - Yes, sir. Mr. Gar-- - No, I've got it. You ready to close, Tony? Hell, yeah, I'm ready to close. Hold on. Hold on a second, baby. Give Sofia my love. Let's get this done. Yeah, okay. I'm-- I'm right behind you. Hello? Baby, hey, you there? Hello? Jesus. - Janet? - Yes, sir? Hey, pick up. Hi, Tony. Listen, you gotta, uh-- you gotta do me a favor, okay? You gotta help me get out of this meeting early. - Oh, it's gonna be a bad day, isn't it? - I hope not. Do me a favor. Tell Sofia to be home early, okay? - I got a surprise for her. - What surprise? What do you mean, what surprise? I don't know. I have no idea. You-- You just-- You gotta handle it, okay? Do it. Uh, whatever you would do with-- with Cheryl-- do it, okay? Okay. I'm on it. - Hey, Mr. Garnett. - Hey, Tony. How are you? - I'm good. - Ready to close today? You bet. Gentlemen, my name is Susan W. Quindal. I am your chosen mediator for today's negotiations, and I hereby bring this session to order. - Please take your seats. - Morning. Thank you. I wanna remind everyone that these negotiations still fall under the tenets of the Traxil-Pharmical Acquisition Agreement that both parties signed. If there is no resolution by 7:30 p.m. tonight, talks will break off for, at minimum, a prescribed 30-day cooling period. So, Chairman Paul Ulsan of Traxil, do you agree? Agree. And Chairman Leo Garnett of Pharmical Industries, do you agree? - Agree. - Would you gentlemen shake? Let's make this happen. Let's do it. Gentlemen, you will find in front of you the due diligence report with an independent appraisal of the various components of the Pharmical Industries. The few key sticking points that we will be discussing today will include the SEC filings, the clinical trials data, liens and judgments, and the product development reports. Any questions? Let's go. Leo, everybody at this table wants this to close today. Yeah, we do, too. Everything all right, son? Oh, uh, I gotta go. Something just came up. - Now? - Yeah. Tony, we're two hours away from closing the biggest deal in this company's history. It's all right, Leo. It's fine. - You really need to go? - Yeah. It's-- It's personal. - Go ahead. - Thank you.

Flowers are on their way. Dinner's at Gianardo's. It's very romantic. I took Cheryl there for our anniversary. She loved it. All right? And the best part-- you have two tickets tonight at will call for La Bohme. You're the best. If you didn't hate men, I'd totally make out with you right now. - If you need me, I'm on-- - Not available. Cell phone. Thank you. Baby, I'm home! Hey. Sof. Sofia, I'm home. You have two messages.

I know my rights. You're holding my money. And this is an emergency. Now you get on the phone and you call whoever it is that you have to call.

The only call you are to make is to us-- - Sumner, hey, um-- - Holy Mackerel. - What are you doing? - Can I-- Look, I'm in-- I'm in a lot of trouble right now, and if I don't get out of here, it's gonna be worse. Can you help me? Can I just-- I need your help. - Can I go in your house? Is that okay? - Wow. Yeah. - Can we go in? That's fine? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have no money. We have a problem. - Mr. Garnett? - Yes, sir. We have a few questions about this SEC filing back in '04. I assure we followed everything to the letter, Mr. Ulsan. Well, let's discuss your concerns, Mr. Ulsan. I think that'd be appropriate. What-- What the hell's going on? - Sofia was kidnapped. - What? And if I wanna see her again, I have to be at MacArthur Park in an hour and ten minutes with $50,000. - And I don't have that kind of money. - Are you kidding me? Fif-- - How much? - They're folowing me. They're listening to my calls, and I don't know what I'm gonna do. Who-- Who-- Who? Look. Lookit. Look. You see them? Unit 74, please invest-- They followed me from the bank, and I didn't stop. - You ran? - I can't stop. What am I supposed to do? I have an hour and ten minutes. Okay, okay. Let's just think it through. Let's think it through. Where can you get that kind of money? Uh, can you wire the money? Can you wire it? No. The bank-- It's 6. It's closed. - Credit cards. - I don't have that kind of credit. How about somebody who does have that kind of money? - Somebody who's rich? - I don't know. No, no, no. - Beaucoup rich. - No. Think. There's gotta be somebody. In your line of work, there's somebody who's got that kind of money. My boss, Edward. - I can't call Edward. - Okay. There you go. - I'm not gonna call Edward. - Where-- Here. - I can't. No, no, no. No, no, no. - Here. Call him right now. I'll be right back. Hello. Tony West's office. - Janet, it's Tony. - Hi. Uh, is Edward there? Can I talk to him? Sure. He's still downstairs with Mr. Garnett and Mr. Ulsan. - Can you get him for me, please? - Uh-huh. - It's really important. - Are you on your cell? No, I'm not on my cell. Um, can, uh-- Okay, have him call me-- Have him call me on this number. - 310-- - 310, right? - Is this 310? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. - 310-222-- - 222-- - 8242. - 8242. Okay. Got it. I'll do it now. - Okay. - Okay? Hey, you take that. One for you, one for me. I modified these awhile ago. I have no idea what kind of range they are, but, you know, the kids-- You don't-- I-- You don't need to do this. Yeah, I know that, But I figured you'd do the same for me. You know, what else do we do? Seriously, so... Okay, this is what we gotta do. Uh, we gotta figure out if there's anything that we know that-- that-- that's gonna help us. - Anything. - Okay, okay. I don't know. I don't know if this means anything, but when I went in my house, the door to my office was closed, and I never close my office door. Okay. What's in there? Just, uh-- Just normal stuff. Office stuff. I have a computer. I have a desk and a chair. I have a lamp. All right. Well, that's something we have to check out. But I can't go over there. The police are outside. Well, I'm gonna do that. You want me to help you? Then let me help you. What else am I gonna do? Water? Rake? Come on. So, this is what we're gonna do. - You're gonna go to MacArthur Park? - MacArthur Park. And you're gonna call your boss and try to get the money, all right? And I'm gonna go over to your house and check out your-- No, you can't go over there because the police are outside. - And if they see-- - Let me figure that out. That's my problem, okay? So, you can't take your car. There's no way, 'cause they know your car, right? - Yeah. - Take mine. Come on. Let's go. It needs gas. Hey. ...in the vicinity of Figueroa. Unit 27, Code 10, please. Unit 27, ETA seven minutes. Look, we gotta get moving. We've gotta get this thing done. Then we'll aim for less than an hour. Keep me posted. I wanna know the instant we get it. - This is Edward. - Edward. - Hey, it's me. - Tony, we've been looking for you. - Is that Tony? - Listen, something's happened. - Let me talk to him. - What is it? What happened? Sofia's been kidnapped, Edward. What? Yeah. Hold on. Give me a second. - Start over. - When I got to the house, I checked the answering machine, and there was a message, and they said that if I didn't have $50,000 at MacArthur Park in the next 64 minutes, that they're gonna kill her. What? Who? Edward-- Edward, is that Garnett? Hey, don't-- don't tell him-- that we're talking and what's going on. They said that if I involve anybody, that they're gonna kill her. - Don't worry. Where are you? - I'm heading to the park. - Can I call you back on this number? - Yeah. I'll call you right back. How are we supposed to negotiate when our general counsel is AWOL? Sumner? Jeez. Yeah? Hey, anything? No. I just got in here. Let me look around a second. Well, if someone was here, the police probably scared them away. So, let's-- let's walk through this again. You came home, and then what? I got home, I checked the message, uh, and then, uh-- and then I went and looked for Sofia. And the door to your office was open then, right? Yeah. And then when I didn't find her, I went back down to the kitchen, and then I got the number. I wrote down the number. Is it 310-555-7950? Yeah. Give me that-- Give me that number again. Cool. Thanks. I'm gonna call you back. Yeah? Tony, I've got Mr. Garnett on the line. Edward took off. - Can you talk? - No, not right now. What should I tell him? Tony, he said that if your job was at all important to you, that you-- Listen, Janet, I can't deal with this right now, all right? Uh, if, uh-- Just-- Just tell Garnett-- that you can't-- you can't get ahold of me, okay? Tony, he's really pissed off. To-- Mr. Garnett, I'm sorry, sir. I can't seem to reach him. Mm-hmm. Janet-- Tony, it's Edward. Oh, hey, Edward. God, I'm sorry. I-- It's-- Garnett's got Janet just tracking me down. It's driving me crazy. You let me deal with him. Take a deep breath. Edward, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I don't know. I'm freaking out. Sofia means everything to me, and I'm just-- I'm-- I'm freaking out. We'll take care of this-- you and I. Wait. Wait, Edward. What about the meeting? You can't just leave the meeting. I can and I did. Now, where are we? - I need to wire $21 ,000. - Twenty-one thousand. - That's how much I'm short. - Okay. All right. I thought I had more, but Sofia-- Sofia handles the money, and I-- It's-- We don't-- That's what we have. It's all right. I'm here to help. Now, what else? I don't know. That's it? You know what? I have a phone number. I don't know if it means anything, but, uh-- I don't know. Maybe we can track it to an address or something. Give it to me. All right. Call me back. Tony, it's Edward. That phone number you gave me is to an office downtown. - Corner of Maple and Highland. - You already got it? Yeah, I called in a favor. Uh, now what about that wire transfer? - What about it? - How do I do it? Give me a minute. I'll figure it out. I'll call you back. Look, I can just call Janet-- Darn. Tony West's office. Janet? Hey, Janet, it's me. Listen, I need your help. I need to know how to wire money off of a credit card. What? I need to wire $21 ,000 off of a credit card. Tony, what's going on here? You're avoiding Mr. Garnett. You're looking for money. Oh, jeez. You wouldn't-- You wouldn't believe me if I told you. - Try me. - Look, Sofia's been kidnapped, okay? And if I don't bring them the money in less than an hour, they're gonna kill her. Oh, my God. Look, I need your help, all right? Now, I-- There was a Stern Union somewhere down by the park, but I need to know how to get the money wired there. Oh, okay. Tony, I'm so sorry. - I'll call you back, okay? - Call me back. Sumner, go ahead. Okay. I'm in. So, is this yours or your wife's office? It's mine mostly. Why? Well, then it probably doesn't have anything to do with your wife, right? Whoa. Hey, I think someone was on your computer, 'cause it's warm. Uh, Anthony, was there anything you were involved in? Uh, nothing. I mean, I'm general counsel for a pharmaceuticals company. - That's it. - Okay. So why would someone kidnap someone over pharmaceuticals? Well, I don't know. Maybe... - What? - Money? Well, how much money? Fifty grand. No, no, no. In pharmaceuticals, how much? Listen, even the-- even the smallest drug campaign generally-- You know, it costs north of, like, 200 million. Right. So why would someone kidnap someone for $50,000 when there's even a bigger pot of gold to be had? I don't-- I don't get that. - What's on it? - On what? Your computer. What's on it? Well-- You know, nothing. I mean, e-mails and files. You know what? I got a file-- I had a file e-mailed to me this morning. It was huge. It was totally corrupted, and it crashed my computer. Okay. I'll check on that. So what-- All right. Hang on for a second. Yeah? Tony, it's Edward. I just spoke with Janet. She, uh-- She told me about the wire transfer. I'll do it as soon as I hang up. It'll be there when you arrive. Great, Edward. I can't thank you enough. What else is going on? You know the guys that broke into the house? They didn't take anything. They didn't go through the jewelry or anything. You mean they just wanted her? Maybe. I don't know. I... We're not really sure yet. "We"? Yeah. Yeah-- No-- I have a-- I have a neighbor helping me. Your neighbor? No, his name is-- is-- is Sumner, Sumner Cavic. He's a-- He's a friend. Tony, who else have you told? Only Janet. Why? Are you sure you can trust these people? Yeah, Edward. Of course. All right. What do you know about them really? What are you asking me? Could this be someone you know? Well, you know, I mean, Janet had to make it through, uh, Pharmical's background check, so we know she's fine. And-- And Sumner's fine. He's my neighbor. He's-- He's fine. Are you willing to gamble with Sofia's life? Edward, it's not like I have much of a choice, you know? I mean, I needed help with this. - It... - I understand. This isn't something that I can-- that I can handle alone. And, Tony, you're not alone. I'm with you every step of the way. But the question remains, can you trust your friend? Listen, let me call you back. Hey, Sumner, you still there? Yeah, I'm here. - Listen, I-- - Give me a second. - Tony West's office. - Hey, it's me. I need to see what you can find on Sumner Cavic. Who is he? He's my neighbor, but Edward's got me paranoid. Is there any possible way that we can do a background check on him? Uh, sure. We'll have to get his social security first though. Wait a minute. Wait. We sent-- We sent his application into HR last week, right? Mm-hmm. I'm checking now. Oh, also, there's a Stern Union across the street from the park on Wilshire and Alvarado. Thanks. Thanks, Janet. Hey, Sumner, I'm back. Yeah. Good. Don't go away. What's your password? I need your password to get in. Um, I don't know. You think they bypassed it? I don't know. If they didn't get around it, then, you know-- then forget it. Anthony, if I can get to your file manager, I can retrace their steps. Do you understand? Listen, Sumner, it doesn't-- You know what? Just-- It's fine. - Anthony-- - Hello? Hello? What's the pa-- Sumner? Hello? Anthony! Anthony? Oh... Out of range. Okay. Everything okay there? Yes. Are you sure you can't use some help? After what happened before? Yeah, I know what happened before. - Are you sure you don't need help? - No. We've got one more shot at this. I can't have any more mistakes. We'll get it. I'll be there, honey. Me, too. Okay. Yes! I'm in. Tony West's office. Hey, it's me. - See your ID, please? - Sumner's clean. They've got no record on him. Nothing. There's nothing? Nada. Just a couple traffic violations. That's it. All right. Is it-- You got it? Is it in? I'm still checking. Sometimes it takes anywhere between 15 to 60 minutes to post. No? Nothing yet. Soon though. Why don't you go ahead and have a seat? Damn. Tony, who else have you told? - Can you trust your friend? - We are watching. Is there any possible way that we can do a background check on him? - Sumner's clean. - Sofia's been kidnapped, Edward. Sofial You are going to bring $50,000 to MacArthur Park. From the hood into the beaches of the south border  Cartel, we bringing you  Just relax, expose your mind to it  Hey. - Hey, what's up, man? - Hey. - Yo, is that a bag of money? - No. Yo, why don't you let a brother hold a couple dollars, man? - Hey, it's me. - Yeah. Okay, I assumed that you had more than one account on this computer, so what I did was I figured out your wife's password. It was, by the way, "Tony." What'd you find? It looks like the log was modified at 5:21 p.m. So somebody was on it. Yep. And it looks like they were looking for a bunch of different search words. Let's see. "Zeffert," "genetic hybridization," uh, "ZHP." Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. ZHP? Yeah. You know what that's about? Yeah. Yeah. See, it's... the internal name for Zeffert's hybridization process. It's a gene therapy we've been developing. And is that important? Yeah, it's really important. Give me a sec. Let me call you back. Okay. Tony West's office. Hey, Janet, it's me. Listen, we gotta find Zeffert. All right? Whoever it is that took Sofia broke into my house looking for information on ZHP. So they weren't looking for her? Well, if they were, then why would they be looking on my computer? - It doesn't make any sense. - And what are they doing? I don't know. Maybe they thought that if they took her, they'd be gaining some sort of leverage with me or something. I don't know. I mean, they got me out of the house so that I couldn't see what they were doing. I don't know. Do you want something? Yeah, hold on a second. Tony? Janet, hey, sorry. So finish what you were saying. There's a connection? I don't know. I don't know what the connection is. It's not-- There's nothing clear about it. But I'm telling you, it's got something to do with that file. So, this was a corporate crime? It's a little extreme, don't you think? If we find Zeffert, we'll have our answer, all right? Um... Sir? Sorry. Hold on. Hey. Tony, it's Edward. That phone number you gave me-- it's a dead end. Security didn't even know the office was open. - Oh, no. - What's wrong? The cops are here. At the Stern Union office? How'd they find you? No, no, no. I'm not at the Stern Union. I'm across the street at the park. Shit. You know what? The guy put my information from my driver's license, and the computer must have triggered something. All right. What's going on? No, no, no. The money. Edward, the money. What about it? I can't get to it. No, no. I can't get to it in time. This is-- Oh, no. Take it easy, okay? I'm-- I'm getting in my car. I'll be there in 15 minutes. Don't worry. It'll be fine. Oh, this is bad. Edward, this is bad. This is over. It's over. What's over? I gotta forget about this. I can't do the money. I have to do something else. Now hold on. You can't be suggesting we don't pay the ransom? No, Edward. The cops got the money. Shit! Tony, look, think about this. It's fine. It's okay. We got time. We got time. It's six-- It's 6:44. All right. Hey... Edward, the people that took Sofia-- they were on my computer. They were going through our files. What sort of files? The ZHP files. - I think it was Traxil. - You can't be serious. I don't know. That's my first thought. What do you think? Why would they think you have the ZHP file? I don't know. I don't know. You know what? Zeffert sent me this e-mail. It was a huge file, and it just completely corrupted-- It crashed my computer. All right. - Tony, do you have that file? - I don't know. I mean, even if I did have it, I have no idea where it would be. All right. Look, there were two copies. There was mine and Zeffert's. He borrowed mine, though. He never returned it. I've left him several messages, but he hasn't returned my calls. Edward, we gotta-- we gotta tell Garnett about this. No. No. No. We don't have enough proof. Look, Tony, we need some time on this, okay? We can get this. We can figure this out. We just need some time. Hold on. I'll call you back. Hello. Tony, it's me. Hey, Janet. Let me call you back in two minutes, okay? Okay. Hey, I'll give you 40 bucks for your hat and sweater. Hey, it's me. Tony, remember Edward sent you some ZHP file? Yeah. What about it? You said Zeffert sent you some huge file that was corrupted, right? Well, yeah, I don't know if it was that file. Well, it just occurred to me that last week, Zeffert said that he needed your home address so that he could send you a package. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Positive. Maybe it was that file. Oh, you know what? Do me a favor. Go downstairs and see if they're still in there. Hey. They're still in negotiations. Good. Oh, and I don't know what happened to Zeffert. He still hasn't checked in. I left another message. What could he be doing? No idea. Do not let him out of your sight. Tony, so if they were looking for the ZHP file, why not just ask for it? Why would they steal it? ZHP is our-- is our number-one product. They'd have to have paperwork-- like, extensive paperwork to show that it was theirs. So why steal it at all? Honestly, if I'm Traxil and I'm about to drop billions of dollars to buy a company, I'd wanna see for myself. If they knew what was said after it failed its first clinical trials, - I'd wanna know. - And why now? If we don't close tonight, they have Now, if they find out that data was altered in any way-- You know what? They could sue us. They'd sue us for nondisclosure, and at that point, we'd be investigated by, uh-- by the SEC, and-- and the FDA. Our stocks would plummet. It's a hostile takeover. I'm sure. They'd buy us out. They'd get us for pennies on the dollar. Wait. ZHP doesn't work? No, no. ZHP works. I mean, it works now. It works now. Zeffert, he turned things around. Yeah, well, then why would Traxil even risk getting caught? If-- If they do, everything's over. Well, because they're buying us. Janet, they're buying us, and billions of dollars are at stake. I don't know. I guess they-- I guess they think that the rewards outweigh the risks. Okay, so let me get this straight. They're looking for some file that has something to do with ZHP. When they don't find it, they take Sofia. But-- But Sofia was only home because you-- Sofia was only home because I sent her there. Oh, my God, Tony. I'm so sorry. Yeah, it's, uh-- It's some anniversary, huh? All this was just a case of the wrong place at the wrong time, right? That's it. So this whole ransom thing is just a cover. They were just trying to get you out of the house long enough to take the file. Most of my files are in the office except, um... Hey, Sumner, are you there? Can you hear me? You've got to get out of the house right now. Sum-- Get out of the house. Shit. Oh, this just gets better all the time. He's in there! Whoever's in the house, listen carefully. I know what you want. I have the disk. It's here with me. I'm gonna wait exactly one minute. If you want it, then you pick up the phone. Hey, come here. Twenty seconds. Hello? Hello? You've got the disk? Where's my wife? You bring the disk, we'll bring your wife. You know where I am. Come and get it. Tony. Hey, it's me. Oh, God, Tony. I know why we didn't hear from Zeffert. He's dead. What? The police called Edward, and I overheard the call. They found Zeffert shot in the head. I guess they called to ask him some questions or... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Also, I found a message from Zeffert that he left two days ago. I guess with everything that's been going on, I just didn't have time to hear all your incoming messages. What did he say? Uh, he said a lot of things. I'll patch you through to voice mail. You can hear for yourself. Hold on. Yeah, okay. Tony, it's Zeffert. Listen to me. Edward covered up seven deaths so we could rush to announce ZHP. The results were nowhere near our thresholds. We tried our best while he pushed forward. We had no idea that he would announce the product. I've sent you my file with the real findings by e-mail, and, uh, I also sent you my original disk and Edward's altered disk by ZepEx. You need to be careful, man. Trust no one. How could a guy like this just vanish? I don't know. You tell me. How could an everyday Joe just go off like this? - I don't know, man. - Possible 187. Please advise your ETA. And 1 4-niner... Hey. Hey, you okay? Hey. Uh, well, I haven't had this much exercise since my honeymoon, but, yeah. Well, listen, they don't want money. What do you mean? Everybody wants money. Whoever it is that took Sofia-- I know what this is about. It's-- It's a file. They want a file. Zeffert sent it to me. What do you mean? What do you mean? What do you mean? This is about files? Yeah, I mean, it's a-- it's a billion-dollar file. It's Zeffert's hybridization process. It can-- It can rewrite genetic code. It can actually block tumors. Okay. Zeffert must've figured out that somebody would come looking for it. So, you know, how do you figure Zeffert knew that, though? Well, he's dead. I mean, that tells me a lot. Okay. Yeah. So... I have a really bad feeling that-- that-- that Traxil's behind this. Who-- Who's he? It's not a person. They're-- They're-- It's our number-one competitor. Right now, they're in the middle of a 75 billion-dollar buyout of our company. Wow. What do you mean-- - Wait. Hold on. - What do you mean-- Hey! - Hello. - Tony, it's Edward. Hey. Did you hear about Zeffert? Yeah. It's terrible. I have no idea who could have done such a thing. You know, Tony, if it is Traxil, someone would have had to tell them about that file. mine and Zeffert's. Well, who could have done it? You tell me. I don't know. You know, Tony, there is a possibility that Zeffert could've been working with them. You're kidding. No, it's true. And if that's the case, if he wouldn't cooperate, they probably killed him. Where are you, Tony? I'm at the park. Let me call you back. I'm here now. He lied to me. He knows. Oh, God, I think I'm gonna be sick. What's going on? Edward's in on it. Your boss? Yeah. He's the one who took Sofia? I don't know what to think anymore. Uh, hey, you know-- you know what, Anthony? Uh, the human resources position-- you can just kind of rip up my application, 'cause I'm not sure that-- that your company would be such a great place to work. Mr. Garnett, it's Edward. - Can it wait? - No. Thank you. What is it? How close are you to closing the deal? We've still got 33 minutes to closing. Why? Don't waste time. Get it done. And do not-- I repeat-- do not let them walk away from the table. So you think that Edwards is after the files? I'm not sure. Well, what's on the disk? Data. Yeah, I figured that out. What kind of data? What'd it look like? - I don't know. I haven't seen it. - Speculate. No, I don't wanna speculate until I've actually seen it. - I have no idea. - Okay. Well, where are they? Where was the last time you saw these-- these disks? He sent it in two forms. He e-mailed me, and he sent me a hardcopy in case the email didn't work. Sofia signed for the package, and then she put it in my briefcase, and I brought it to work with me. Okay, then-- So you took them to the office. Wait. No. You know what? I was running late. When I got in the car, my briefcase-- my briefcase opened up and all my stuff spilled out. - It could be in the car. - The disk are in your car? If it's not in the car, it's in the house. Okay, okay, Anthony. Three things, okay? Uh, I didn't see anything like that kind of envelope in your car. Two, you know, they may have been in there and found it. I don't know. And three, I am not going back into your house to look for a spare key for your car. There is no way! No, you don't have to. There's a-- There's a spare key. It's on a, uh-- It's on, like, a magnet strip on the back bumper of the car. Ah. Okay. All right. All right. All right. I got that. I got it. - Wait a minute. No, you know what? - What? They might still be there. Anthony, I'm gonna make sure that-- - that they're not gonna be there, okay? - No, Sumner. - I'm on it. Bye. - No. Sumner, don't go. - Don't-- - Bye. Bye. Bye. Tell me you have it. There's no sign of it yet. I was assured we'd have it by now. If we don't have it in our possession in ten minutes, get rid of all evidence. Not a problem. Good. - Tony West's. - Hey, it's me. Listen, it's just a matter of time before they come by the office. - It's here? - No, it's not, but they don't know that. Look, they've been through my place, all right? So most likely, the next place that they're headed is gonna be there. - I'm not leaving. - Janet-- Janet, this isn't up for discussion. - I know. What do you want me to do? - Janet-- All right. All right. Look, just get into Edward's office and-- and see if you can get into his files. Get any-- anything that you can on ZHP. We're gonna need all the evidence we can get. Uh, doesn't he keep his office locked? No, his secretary has a spare key. What, do you want me to break in? Tony? Oh, God. Monday morning, I want a raise. This is Edward. Where does it end? Tony. Where does it end? I know about the trials, and I know about the seven deaths. And you know what? I cannot even believe that you would kidnap my wife. What are you talking about? Look, just tell me where she is, okay? I don't know. Where's Sofia, Edward? Where's my wife? We didn't kidnap her. That's bullshit! Tony, you have to believe me. I would never do anything to hurt Sofia. I know-- I know about the data that you distorted, Edward. I know about everything that you did. I'm sorry. It's what we did. Every document and every statement that came out of Pharmical carried both of our signatures. You know what? I trusted you. I trusted you, and you lied to me. You know that I would never have signed off on ZHP if I had seen any of the actual data. - You know that. - Please, get off your soapbox. This is the real world, pal. What about the kidnapping? I told you, I had nothing to do with that. Well, there's too much riding on this for you. For you, for me, for all of us. If that data would've gotten out, we would've all been finished. Really? Yeah? Just like Zeffert's finished? Look, Zeffert couldn't handle the responsibilities that went along with success. He was gonna go to the press. And I'm sorry, but I couldn't let him do that. ZHP is a miracle drug. It is a cure for cancer. You were the one, weren't you? You were the one, the whole time, pulling strings? Did Garnett have anything to do with it? Garnett doesn't have a clue on what's going on. Tony, one thing you have to realize is that when the moment arrives, you have to be ready for it. You have to be ready to stand up. When you see it, you have to be ready to fight for it. You know what? The SEC's gonna figure this out. They're not gonna figure anything out. I mean, by midnight, this is gonna be a faint memory. That's all that matters to you, isn't it? That's all that matters. This is worth billions of dollars! If an eight-figure bank account isn't enough to curb your tongue, it's more than enough motivation for all of us! This is about more than money, Edward. It's about more than money. There are lives at stake with this. There are always lives at stake, and, unfortunately, now yours is one of them. Yeah, well, you know what? You know what, Edward? This is how it's gonna go down from this point forward. All right? You're gonna get Sofia back. - We don't have her. - You're gonna get Sofia back for me, or I'm gonna go into the boardroom, and I'm gonna tell Traxil everything that they need to know, all right? You think that Ulsan and the Traxil group are so clean. Maybe it's them you should be asking about the kidnapping. Where's my wife? Look, just calm down. I promise you that I will do everything I can, and we will get her back. "We"? Yes, "we." Both of us. There is no "we" anymore, Edward. Excuse me. Yes. - Tony. - Why are you whispering? I'm in Edward's office. They're here. Janet, I'm almost there, all right? Just hang on, okay? Hurry. Yes! Don't move. Okay. You know, the cops are on the way. Sure they are. Shut up. Let her go. Let her go. Come on. We're all on the same team here. Not anymore. We have your wife. - Her life now rests in your-- - Damn it, what is that? We have your wife. Her life now rests in your hands. We have your wife. Her life now rests in your hands. What is that? What is that, bells? Her life now rests in your hands. Sprinklers are giving me hell. You know, I have to rotate them, like, every hour. We have your wife. Her life now rests-- Hello. Hey, it's Tony. Hey, where have you been? I haven't heard from you. I'm at the office. Are you at your house? - Janet, hey. - Yeah. Oh, thank God that you're still there. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. They left the office chasing you. Did you lose them? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think so. Listen, you gotta stop the negotiations right now. - I can't. - They can't close this deal, Janet. - What do you want me to do? - You gotta go in there and you gotta tell Garnett everything. Well, what about you? What are you going to do? I'm gonna get my wife back. Okay. Let's go. Janet, you gotta stop the negotiations right now. - Security. Adams here. - What happened? We've got a fire alarm on the 20th floor, sir. - We're looking into it. - God damn it. Attention. Please proceed to the nearest exit. Attention. Please proceed to the nearest exit. This is Ulsan. We got it. We can still deliver. Has it been checked? Sumner says it checks out. It's the disk that you've been waiting for. I'll dispose of the girl and make all the necessary arrangements. Good. Bring it to the office now. Unit 212 requesting backup. Shots fired. I repeat, shots fired. Drop it! Now! Okay. Okay. Ow! God! Tony-- Tony-- Were you a part of all of this? The computer being warm? All this? The whole day? You were part of all of this? No. No, no. You think I was a part of this? No. No. No way. You think I was involved? No. Look, they ordered me. They said, "Get the disk." That's what they said. "Get the disk." I trusted you. Did you know that? I trusted you all day. I trusted you. None of this was supposed to happen. I don't get it. Traxil's been trying to get this Zeffert file for months. Today was their last chance. How'd they know about the file? I can't believe this. Someone in your company must've told them or got careless. I mean, the kidnapping-- not planned. But your wife came back. What the hell are they supposed to do? So this whole ransom thing was just to get you out of the house. Did you get a piece of this? Did you get a piece of this? Yeah! Fifty grand! $50,000, okay? The way my life's circling the drain-- sounded pretty good to me! Yeah! And don't you look at me like that. Don't you dare look at me like that. You'd have done the same thing. Don't tell me I would've done the same thing! You should've called the police! The police? Are you kidding me? When this thing went down to the wire, Traxil sent in the big boys to make sure that it went down. I-- Call the police? Oh, Jesus. They promised me-- They promised me that there weren't going to be any problems. They said every contingency was taken care of. That's what they said to me. I can't believe you. I can't believe you. How about that contingency, huh? Was that covered? They said every contingency was taken care of. That's what they said to me. You prick. You okay? Huh? - Yeah. - You okay? It's okay. I love you. I'm sorry. You sure you're okay? I'm fine. So Sumner was holding Sofia the whole time? Yeah. Yeah, right next door. Wow. How is Sofia? You know, she's shaken up, but she'll be okay. Are we still going to have jobs tomorrow? Yeah. Leo's gonna make sure the stockholders understand that Edward was working on his own when he had Zeffert killed. By the way, Janet, I couldn't have done it without you. - Thanks. - Really? You're welcome. - Can I have tomorrow off? - Of course.
