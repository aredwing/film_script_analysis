Razor Here it is the battle ship Pegasus for the ship that alleges to be the Galactic. Please answer. Pegasus? I thought that the whole fleet it had been destroyed. We didn't have idea that there were survivors. On behalf of the officials and of the team of Pegasus... be welcome of turn to the colonial fleet! What did to you was wandered. The one that you need is justice. Will iron... And she died knowing that the ship and the crew was safe and that her mission had been concluded with success. Nothing was more important to her that the ship, the crew and the mission. And when assuming the control of Pegasus, interest to maintain those you idealize that you/they did a leader of her so it executes and heroic. The news on the murder of Fisk they dispersed for the whole fleet... she will undo to the knowledge that lost one more commander. Pegasus lost two in subject of weeks. Put Garner in the command. Commander Garner, two ship-base has just approached. Missiles to I walk, we are under attack! We needed those motors MRL repaired soon or we are dead. Mister, we lost Garner. He was sacrificed to save Pegasus. Garner was my choice. His flaw it is my responsibility. Congratulations, commanding. Pegasus is now under his/her command. As I said: You make yours choices, and he/she will have to live them. And at the end of the bills, you are it result of their choices. in search of a home call Earth Translation of the audio and sincronismo: LMP Minisrie "Razor" I am sweating as a child in his/her first day of class. I won't cause myself regrets of bringing him/her with me, does it go? -???- Give the good arrivals to the new commander of Pegasus, commander Lee Adama. Thank you very much, lady President, and admiral Adama. Eight months ago the world changed, and our lives changed, forever. We saw bowing with responsibilities never foreseen. Duty, Honor, Service. That is more than simple words. These are the beginnings that guide those that serve in the army. And all were in lack until recently in those that serve on board of this ship. And that will change, beginning today. We cannot choose the circumstances, but we can choose as we solved them. I intend to give him/her everything that I have and I don't wait less than that in change. I already chose Kara Thrace as current CAG and I will point other functions and officials next days. As soon as I revise yours... The more the things change, more them do they stay same, it is not, Gus? Among. Lieutenant Kendra Shaw coming as order, gentleman. Be comfortable. He/she sits down, please. No, thank you. I got used to being of foot in this room. Certain, to admiral Cain seemingly it was not fan of chairs. Same died, this woman he/she continues throwing shadows here. I am sure that I don't need to tell him/her that. I was reselling the reports of the officials of this ship and frankly, you are a jigsaw puzzle. You have high recommendations of Cain, that clearly liked you... and later a series of negative reports, and every time worse, of Fisk and Garner... that they finished him/her putting at the kitchen, for "behavior of repeated insubordination." Then the question is... who are you? Shipyard of the fleet Scorpion Kidnapper 179, you are liberated for to land at the dock 3, understood? Expert Pegasus, are arriving. Among! That is his/her reading idea during the vacations? And the one what is that, does he/she have a hobby now? Yes, I have. Then... You already decided where it will pass their vacations? I am thinking about visiting some friends, but it is not definitive still. In this case, because it doesn't come with us, a time to pass in Gemini? I know that he/she won't have problem in coming together. We are going Helena, you deserve a rest. See, I have a list of repairs as long as my arm and I never left the ship of vacations because he/she knows that I don't like to leave the ship with that personal terceirizado, therefore... Hear him/it that yours SHOO he/she is saying: Once in a while it is allowed to leave the mat. I will think to respect. I will think to respect. Right. For kindness, I could indicate myself the road for... For kindness, it could show me... Seeking for C&C? Yes! How did he/she know? You have that official badge that he/she needs to moderate. One of the advantages of being a net administrator. Here we are, and here it is where you should be. You saved my life. Kendra Shaw. Gina Envier. Envier? That an old word Gemini for rebirth, it is not? One of the advantages of having formation in classic deeds. You never know when a knowledge you gave can be him/her useful. Welcome to Pegasus, lieutenant. Thank you very much. Lieutenant Kendra Shaw moderating to the service, lady. Did you like his/her coffee, lieutenant? My coffee? Just answer that yes, so that let us don't have a bad beginning. Yes, lady. Very well. Because I thought that you could be had lost in the road to C&C or you gave a stop to take a coffee. And I prefer to think that was because of it coffee to have an official that gets lost in the ship. Mrs., I have just arrived. I still didn't finish. I know because it is here. It is here because it thinks this job is a form of getting something better in the neighbor. Therefore he/she lets to guess me: his/her mother he/she collected some favors, and her... My mother died, lady. She died from cancer. Yes, I know. I read in the newspapers. And even if I am feeling a lot for his/her loss it will be better for you if never again to try to move me. Between you and me, I feel much more he/she grieves of me same. - Mr. Hoshi? - Mrs.? He/she could show to lieutenant where is her room? - Yes, lady. - It is released. Lieutenant. Our tidbit of the middle of the morning. - I will be in my room. - Yes, lady. We have a net system that allows to control each part of that ship starting from any point, you just need the password. The system is turned off in this moment because of the reform, but in an emergency there would be a limitless number of backups. Since nobody presses the wrong button. Yes, there he/she sees a flotation can. There is always a weak point. Are you well? We go, soldier. Stand up! Hoshi! Hoshi! Ok, follow me until C&C. Let us go! There it is other! Stamp the floodgates! What devil did he/she reach us? I am receiving data of explosions nuclear. Multiple impacts. They are the cylons, I am sure. For the way they disrespected the armistice and now they are executing an attack of wide climbs. Activate the generators auxiliaries. This is the problem. As we are in maintenance, our radar is erratic, the computers are turned off we needed to work everything manually. All want the stamped floodgates, and connections with the dock undone. - Lieutenant, see the state of the motor MRL. - Yes, lady. Everything prepared world for an emergency escape. Mrs., we have nuclear missiles the I walk, they remain 20 seconds until the impact. MRL is in order, however without the computers cannot calculate the route. Don't waste time making calculations, just do! Mrs., a flight blindly can take us inside of a sun! Missiles approaching! Remove us of here, just do, now, lieutenant! Motor MRL is linked... Lieutenant, NOW! Who am I? I am a soldier. As for Fisk and Garner, these men didn't deserve respect, therefore I didn't respect them. Could you be more specific? Fisk operated in the black market, it was one I sand that didn't deserve to use an uniform... and Garner was a technician that treated all as if they were just part of a machine. It is difficult to disagree with both descriptions. And as for me? Why don't only be repressed am still alive. You are an improvement... but that doesn't change the fact that is one outsider that arrived to put order, nor the impression that his/her dad he/she gave him/her a battle ship as if it was playing him/her the keys of a new car. You don't really disappoint, lieutenant. Then, you would like to be the my new official executive? Mister? A thing that I learned of my father before him plays me the keys it is that a commander needs of a strong right arm. I also need to order a message to the crew that I respect the legacy of Cain, even if is not very truth. I am not Cain, but I intend to return the pride to the crew. Therefore I will leave that you carry the torch. Closed business? In this case, major, arrange an uniform. It is released. Ten Nine Eight Seven Six Five Four Three Two A - it ended. You think this weapon is ready to shoot, soldier? Yes, lady! You would bet his/her life in that, or their companions' life? Mrs.... Yes, lady. Then work this weapon. You deaf, soldier? I ordered to shoot with that weapon. Once again. You got something impossible. He/she found a SHOO more evil than Tigh. Yes, she is durona. But I think we needed hardness. Does he/she have some attrition? Well, she and Kara don't feel very well. As if it was that went a thing difficult to happen. Just remember that the SHOO it is not one blunt instrument. You two have to form a team. This requests mutual trust. We entrusted one in the other for to do our works. It is already a beginning. Now that his/her house is in order, I have a mission for you. Against my best judgement, I allowed that a scientific team it used a ship our Kidnapper. To study the traces of a supernova. They are late. I want you to track the road, and to see if he/she discovers something. They are three civil, besides two pilots. And if we find the cylons? It is a search mission and rescue. Don't enter in an undesirable fight. Dictated that, use his/her own judgement. The command is yours. Search mission and rescue to the missing Kidnapper Anything my right, anything my left. I am drowning in an emptiness here. We go, sing something for me to know that I have some company. To sing something captain, how type a music? What such "99 Bottles of Ambrosia?" I am so out of tune, you won't tolerate to hear that. It would be terrible. Happen the circuit plate, please. They died more two in the infirmary. - Does that elevate the deaths for how many? - 723. It is more than a fourth of the crew. Which the status of the hunts? And we have 17 ships damaged too much for they be recovered. What more? Mrs., we tried to understand what were able to for the radio, but there are only rumors. We needed facts, no suppositions. I agree. We are to 4, maybe 5 jumps of the colonies. I imagine that he/she doesn't want to take a risk the ship he/she completes for a recognition trip. Order two Raptors, and say for not attacking the enemy. - I just want information. - Yes, lady. Ready for reinicializar the systems of navigation and of defense. Await. Lieutenant? Admiral, the rudder, weapons and motors MRL they are again functional. And I think I understood as the cylons they dropped our protection grating. Those code lines in the new of system of navigation that will be implemented they were drawn to allow access remote to the program for the enemy. It is could transmit like this a virus that does he/she infect the whole net, is it that what says? Exact. Luckily our net already it was turned off and I suggest that maintain her like this, even after terms turned off the program. Ok, lieutenant, the ball is yours. Run with her. He/she seems that you are not so useless as I thought. Is there how long it is in his/her position? I don't know lady, I have faith that me not I left him/it since I arrived. You will owe if he/she lies down a little, it is there is two days working without stopping. Mrs.... I feel a lot... I feel a lot for my behavior when we were reached by the missiles. I got afraid. Actually, it was panicky. And I froze. No longer it is afraid more, is he/she, lieutenant? No, lady. Good. Remember that rage and maintain her/it for close. He/she won't be like this afraid next time and he/she will know what to do. Lieutenant, close the uniform. Here it is admiral. I know that there are many rumors in circulation regarding the destruction of ours planets for the cylons. I would like to say that are exaggerations, but the truth is that... us still nor we understood him/it size of the horror that we suffered. The facts are: Our colonies were destroyed, our cities were atomized, and our fleet also left. Here there are no indications of any other survivors. I believe that all are if asking the same question: What will make now? Will we flee? Will we hide? I think these are the easiest options. A philosopher said once: "When it faces terrible alternatives, just consider his/her duty." Look at his/her turn. Our duty is well here. In our screens, in our ships, in our weapons. And in us same. The war is our duty. And even if a victory seems impossible at this time, there is other thing for the which we should struggle. Revenge. Retribution. We will struggle. At the end of the bills, that is the only alternative that the enemy left us. We will do with that the those murderers understand that, while that team to live, that war, that they began, it won't be finished. Thank you. We say like this all. We say like this all. We say like this all! WE SAY LIKE THIS ALL! WE SAY LIKE THIS ALL! The communication tower resembles with a can openers. It is being kept for half dozen of raiders. - Then? - They don't seem to wait any attack. Gentlemen, they are looking for our first objective. Good work in finding him/it, lieutenant. Thank you, I had help. Speaking about the devil... Hello Gina, be welcome. Gentlemen, I would like them to know Srta. Gina Envier. Srta. Envier and to lieutenant Shaw they have work committees for some time updating our systems, and before of that she was supervising the reform. And I should say that she was shown a lot valuable in the two cases. Thank you very much. You certainly possess a beautiful table. Please they sit down all. I think is important that the officials of the ship they are occasionally to share some food, wine and conversation. Unassuming that is one of the little ones times in that can sit down. Now they are whole here, me he/she would like to tell some words. Speaking serious, I told some things before, in the heat of the emotion. Things that he/she believed that the crew needed to hear in the moment. But I don't want nobody to think that will go to take a risk lives or resources for some crazy inquiry just for revenge. My plan... it is to lock a campaign classic of guerrilla it completes. I want to know of their weaknesses, and I want to get right them to be worth. As I said, the best defense it is to have a good attack. A gift to a good attack. And we will kick some cylons buttocks! I am almost ready here. I don't know if we will get to finish that on time to not to be works in separate, but just you possess the access password. Good, we can speak with to admiral to increase him/her the access rights. Certain, and I thought that were being discreet. It is complicated if it controls when if he/she does like somebody. The program is ready. You need to enter with his/her access password. Alpha - 1 - 9 - 6 - Gamma - 1 To satisfy his/her curiosity, me the I found when presenting the plans of the reform. We passed some time committees, working in the details, and I think one thing took to the other. You seem surprised. It is that Cain seems so self-sufficient. She has needs, such as the rest of us. Nobody gets to survive completely alone. Believe, at the end of the bills we are all just humans. And as for the "99 Bottles of Ambrosia?" You won't want to hear that! Does she never remain silent? To be so talkative is one bad example for the other pilots. We will leave that she serves as example for the ability that she shows as pilot. Mister? Multiple contacts in the dradis, in section 399 direction 620. For the size of the ship... we don't know what is, gentleman. We have company. Pegasus, is Starbuck. Where did those guys come from? Starbuck and Showboat, already return in all the speed for the ship. We are to I walk, Pegasus. Showboat, be with me! Work the defensive cannons, have care with our personnel. To prepare to leave of here like this that recover our ships. Yes, gentleman. Those ships... I am almost getting to see them. He/she has something eccentric in them. Mister, should we throw Vipers and to attack? It is not for that that we are here, major. But gentleman... If we come our missing ship, we will go behind. Otherwise we give him/it out. Pegasus, is Starbuck. We have an annoying guy that he/she doesn't want to let to go us away. Mister, the team of MRL moderates flaw of energy in the system of main navigation. You are playing! How is the emergency reservation? We needed those coordinates of destiny. It is impossible, we are not getting to get rid of them! Get right the cannons for fire automatic, short reach. Now! But that shit! That personal one should be playing! We will give everything that we have. We will make our way until the hangar. Will it be that will work? No, but he/she will make you to feel better. The mother's Filho. She was trying to kill us! Ten. Shaw has the authority of taking any necessary action to protect the ship! She is a raving mad! And she is also executive official. And, frankly, that shooting he/she probably saved his/her skin. Forgive me if I don't thank. Ah go, Kara. I release. You can tell me that devils was he/she thinking? It was a good flight demonstration, captain, but I would think twice before criticizing my tactical orders. Tactical orders? It is like this that he/she calls to open fire against their own pilots? To question orders is a bad idea in that ship, captain. Attack to the station retransmissora - How many ships, lieutenant? - I receive 12 signs, lady. More than hoped to find. A squadron should be capable of to take care of that and to destroy the objective. To throw blue squadron. Mrs., new contacts! But that devil... He/she has a lot of interference, but I detect They must have moved her as soon as we threw our hunts. That is not a retransmisso station, it is a trap. We should call the vipers of turn, lady? Mrs.? Two minutes until the contact. Admiral, the cylons knew that would come. We have to collect the ships and to give the out from here while we can. No... throw reservation's ships. Order that protect the blue squadron while they attack the objective. But they will be in disadvantage of four for one! Mrs., the enemies left formation and they are going for here. To activate defensive cannons. Cannons not answering, lady. The net isolated us of the controls of weapons. Then order the crew to use control manual of the weapons. Admiral, we are in disadvantage, and the our weapons don't obey. That proves additional you need for to notice that is a trap? It is just one more reason to use everything that we have against them. That is exactly it that you he/she said that we would not do. Even if get, it will be that that station is it worth all of the lives that we will lose? Sr. Belzen, you are refusing to execute my orders? Mrs., I cannot obey them. Sr. Belzen, feel his/her weapon. Mrs.? I said: Happen his/her weapon! Now! God! Colonel Fisk... Colonel Fisk! From now on, it will be mine SHOO. My orders stay, please execute them. Here speech the SHOO. All to throw the remaining squadrons. Mrs., the sensor ones indicate that are being invaded by the cylons. Colonel, call the teams of armed combat. Lieutenant, inform our personnel of secondary damages. The cylons will try to remove our air before that we have a chance of defending. Yes, lady. Pass! They are coming over there, all killing ahead. Go to C&C, it will be safe there. But what shit? You! Stand back of the admiral! I said: Stand back of the admiral! Now! You two, take her/it in custody! Wait for a little. What devils is he/she happening? She has just helped to recover the control on the weapons. No lady, she is a spy of the cylons, them now if they seem with us. Ah, for the love of God. Sr. Hoshi, could show us the image of safety of the floodgate 4? She is crazy, I don't know him/it that she thinks to have seen... My God... Remove that thing of my bridge! I have! Behave as officials, for the love of God. Everybody is looking. Of where did come devils them? He/she makes plenty of time since I saw one of those out of a museum. And you say that a whole fleet of that did he/she move for here? They appeared of place none. Why would the cylons reactivate machines what would they consider obsolete today? Maybe don't have been reactivated. Maybe be here alone. There is some thing that would like of telling us? There are references us ours databases regarding a force of centurions call of guardian. Old models, that in some way they got to escape of the sucateamento. What did that guardian ones keep? A to be hybrid. The first step in the evolution of machines for organic beings. And of these, for us. The link lost cylon. It is not anything besides one dead end of the evolution. There was other hybrid that were created to control them ship-base before the researches went interrupted. But there is always a first one. And some thing is still alive, that is being protected for these guardian ones. And in some way, it is seeking for a way to develop. In the last operation during the war, Galactic it was part of a task force that ended up destroying a base of the cylons. I was in that mission. Supposedly, the cylons were building a super-weapon. First war against the cylons All this already happened, and it will happen again. Does he/she have anybody there inside? Help! Help us, we were left here! Don't leave us here, please! I will remove you then. We are civil. They attacked our convoy of Gemini, they appeared suddenly and they attacked our escort and all were arrested. We were 50, but they are diffusing us one for one. We heard the screams of the other ones we don't know what happened to them, you he/she has to remove us of here! I am trying. He/she seems that that door was welded. - What is happening he/she? - I don't know. He/she seems an earthquake. That place is collapsing. I don't get to open more than that. You need to go. You need go look for help. I will be here. No, you won't get alone, go now! See what happened with us. Our ship was Diana. Of Gemini, seek the registrations. If it is, prisoner will stay like us. Go! Go! Survive! Go! Galactic, it is Husker. Galactic, here it is Husker, is he/she in the he/she listens? Husker, are hearing. Which is his/her situation? I fell in the surface. They were making some thing here below. Experiences with our people. It is now are fleeing with the one that they built. Husker? Husker, the war ended. How is it? Galactic, repeat! The war ended. An armistice be just signed. Activate his/her sinalizador and we will order somebody to look for him/it. Husker, answer. They escaped with that. Maybe for that they signed the armistice. If that hybrid one still to exist... then he captured several of our people. It is alone in that that me leaning. Baltar and Tyrol got to extract some of the navigation data of the ship cylon, and to deduce the origin route. For a possible location of the base. More probably a ship-base. It is where we will find the our team of the Kidnapper. He/she is the only 2 or 3 distance jumps of the point where you were attacked. He/she was commenting on there is little that us no we can take a risk both battle ships. For this reason, I am transferring myself temporarily for Pegasus. Are you coming together? You stay in the command. We will say that I have interest personal in this mission. A mission based on a legend cylon. It is not a legend, son. I was in the place where you/they built such thing. I saw what did to build her. We cannot allow that happen again. Not to our own people. Well... I will ask mine SHOO that prepares an attack plan. I fear that that is subject of another discussion, commanding. The key is in leaving the wrong impression. Pegasus will jump directly for the objective. They will attack with the raiders, they will think that incapacitated our motors... while we moved away them in speed sub-light. At this time mine enters I group of attack. It is a very risky plan, I eat knows probably. Just remember that is one search mission and rescue. Enter in the ship, find our personnel, arm the bomb and return completes. Who will pilot the Kidnapper? Captain Thrace. No there is another reliable pilot that will be capable to do that. Then I think the subject is if I can trust you. To president he/she believes that, under the command of Cain, you were involved in an incident on board of a transport of civil, of name Sylla. An incident in which 10 people were executed. Is it true? I asked if it is true. I was there. I think is enough to condemn me. Why didn't count me? You said that he/she wanted to order a message for the crew of the ship... on respecting the legacy of Cain... and I am the legacy of Cain. I am alive because of the choices that she did. As the rest of the crew of the ship. Does he/she want to know more? Cain would not have blinked twice for this I glide. Because she knew that is not possible to win battles without taking a risk lives. Did you finish? Yes, gentleman. If he/she wants my rescission, you will have her. Would that be easy, would not it be? There it could go back to the kitchen to peel potatoes and to have feather of herself, because to poor Kendra Shaw he/she was the only official that he/she had to make a difficult decision. Because that won't glue, major. No while I am in the command. The plan is taken a risk. But at this time you are everything that I have. Therefore it completes his/her mission, major. His/her plan was approved. ... and we are back with the Dr. Gaius Baltar. Doctor, a lot of people thought the arrival of Pegasus was the answer to the our prayers. Were they wrong? Consequences of the attack to the station retransmissora The final report of died points 816 victims, besides 121 wounded. and the boss says that we don't have pieces for all to repair them. It is a high price for a victory of such little tactical impact. He/she would not say that it was insignificant, with certainty got their attention. The price that we paid was for my fault. As the arrived that conclusion, lieutenant? Well, I gave to the thing my access password. She must have used the password for to pass for safety's restrictions. You gave a much more thing important that that. You trusted her, just as me. But that thing does know as to manipulate human emotions. She feeds of them. Lieutenant Thorne... I want you to interrogate ours prisoner cylon and remove everything that knows. And since it was shown so skilled in imitating human emotions... I assume that their software is vulnerable to them also. Therefore... pain, yes it is clear... degradation... fear... shame. I want you to discover the as she supports. Be as creative as is necessary. Yes, lady. Lieutenant Thorne, granted access. Admiral Cain for C&C, admiral Cain for C&C. Lieutenant, come with me. Colonel, which the situation? We have just received signs of radio of colonial ships. Mrs., they are civil. A civil fleet? They are 15 ships, lady. The captain is taking the ship in interception course. Lieutenant, I want that contacts the captains of those ships... ask for them the passengers' list, relationship of loads and outlines of the ships. As well as relationship of weapons, if they have. Yes, lady. Colonel, I want him to catch engineers and soldiers, and visit each one of the ships. Mrs., which we go... We will catch everything that we need those ships. As soon as notice our intentions, they will offer resistance. Therefore we have to act quickly and determination. Colonel, if you have a problem with that, I need to know now. No. To the work. - Permission to come on board? - Granted permission. Be welcome. We prayed for this miracle. In the last time that the cylons us they found, we lost 4 ships. But now, thanks to God, you found us. Sr. Laird, admiral Cain me he/she ordered giving him/her this. What is that? He/she is the material list and passengers that owe Pegasus to be transferred immediately. His/her name is in the list. My name? Wait... You want to take our motor MRL... we will be disabled. As I said, we are putting some people in our team. It is then... you will decide that he/she lives and who will die? We will make the possible, but you need to understand that we are in war. The military needs they possess priority. No. I don't understand... they want to take what need. And they want to leave us here to defend alone. I cannot make that. Hear! All you! We have orders to transport the people and him/it equipment of this list for Pegasus. We don't want to hurt anybody. But we will use force if it is necessary. No. I am not able to, I am not able to. You should help us! I cannot make that. Ship call colonel's Fisk ship. What is having colonel there, we are already delayed. Mrs., they are impeding ours I access to the rest of the ship. We are not just working with individuals, we have whole families. Then inform to the selected that the families of them they will be died if they don't come with us. Mrs.? Did I understand correctly? You are not seriously... Just solve that therefore, colonel. Corporal. Put these people in the deck in line. We have orders of killing the family of all selected them that if they refuse if they go with us. We will execute those orders unless such individuals come to the front now! You should protect us! I repeat: We will execute these orders. We will shoot in these people. What are making, gentleman? Colonel Fisk for Pegasus. Colonel Fisk for Pegasus. He/she ended. The whole fleet already knows what happened here. There won't be more resistance. Then the SHOO human being, after all. I also made that. To be listening the radio, for not to seem that was alone... Does he/she still have more? More of the something? Of that that you will put in his/her neck. Does lack feel of that, doesn't he/she sit down? What you to leave happy, right? I came here to find one bottle without owner, and you... I believe that both only sought one does he/she form of relieving the tension, right? I have faith that yes. That is good. Because I would hate to know that mine SHOO it doesn't support the pressure. That maybe prefers to return the to peel potatoes. And I would hate to think that to I pilot favorite of Lee it can end up cleaning the ground of the ship. You keep my secret, lady... that I keep yours. I already saw more cheerful officials because of a promotion. I am cheerful, lady. Me just not I know what did to deserve her. Don't make that, captain. Don't make that. We sometimes needed to leave people for back, so that we can continue. So that we can continue the fight. We sometimes have to do things... that we never thought that would be capable. Even if is just to show to the enemy our willpower. Yesterday, you showed me... that you are capable. When going away of his/her fear, and of his/her hesitation and same his/her rejection. The natural inhibitions that can make the it differentiates between the life and death in a battle. When you get to be like this... for as much time as goes need... then you are a razor. This war is forcing us we turn her/it razors. Because in otherwise, us we didn't survive. It is later don't have the privilege of we turn ourselves simple humans again, is he/she understanding each other? Good. You worked well. Congratulations, captain. Present Search mission and rescue Breakings of the skull to port. Floors 4 and 12 to 14. Teams of control of damages they are already isolating the area. I think is already enough. Turn off the motor MRL. They come the ship for 161, caram 0. They are following us, gentleman. We will hope continue with us. It seems that you/they believed. Then we will catch our team. Maybe it is easier of the that we thought. Try again - we already have two enemies to I walk. It is hour of the show! Ready? We go, we go go! We go, we go, we go! Destroyed enemy objective. To return for the other ones and to continue in the persecution of the battle ship Pegasus. Yes, gentleman! Report! Everybody of the red squadron he/she is well. Speak for itself, sergeant. I still don't get to feel my fingers. Already stop with that, Hudson. Red squadron, in formation with me! Will we make an aviozinho? Red squadron, to my command! To work propellers! Red 1 for Pegasus. Red 1, here it is Pegasus. Moderate situation of the mission and of the team. We are in a hatchway close to one communication antenna. We are continuing. We will leave the open communication. Stay calm, personal. There is no need to explain him/it that to do with the guards that we find. He/she shuts up! With luck we won't be seen. What is seeing in the sensor thermal? A source of heat. He/she can being of biological origin. He/she is close to the nucleus, but that is everything. Wait, now I am diffusing three new signs. Two are quite weak, and they are coming of about 30 meters ahead. That can be our personnel. We are going ahead. Santos Deuses! Remove them of there now, fast! We go, remove them soon then! Cylon! Everybody outside! Reached man! They diffused of Silva! They diffused of Silva! No! Pegasus, is red 2. Answer, Pegasus! We are hearing, red 2. His/her sign is with noise. We recovered two of the civilians. We have a dead and two wounded, including the SHOO. We are under fort attacks. -???- Pegasus, is red 2. Answer, Pegasus. Captain! Which the situation? Have just lost the communication. The cylons should be obstructing the sign. How is the bomb? How is the detonator? The detonator was reached. Find a form. He/she wants to explain to me that devils was that with of Silva? I cannot allow that diffuse more prisoners, captain... You saw what were doing there inside! Yes, I saw. Continue trying to restore the communication with red 2. Sr. Hoshi... Order the preparation of a missile atomic in the duto of release 3. Yes, gentleman. This is an order of nuclear release. To carry missile ship-to-ship in the duto 3. What is making he/she? They were committed, not we got to reestablish the communication and we have to suppose that the team was lost. We have to give a chance to them. Commander Adama? Open the doors of the release tube. Opening doors of the release tube. Major! Maintain them far away, Hudson! Pegasus, is red 2. Are they in the he/she listens? You should destroy that ship with the personal on board just in last case. Want the non admiral, this no longer it is one more rescue mission. Just God know what will happen to our personnel if they be captured. I know what will happen... I was there. The missile is loaded, commanding. The nuclear weapon shot it is authorized. Incapacitate mechanisms of safety of the ogiva and ignition. Sr. Hoshi, catch the acionamento key and put her/it in the release base. - Yes gentleman. - Hold this order! I am not prepared to sacrifice any life still! - And if it is wrong? - I will have to live with that. You said, admiral, that thing... maybe be in the road to the Earth. If this ship jumps for far away, we lost our only chance of reaching her. Mister? The sign is getting better. We are receiving communication of red 2. Put in the speakers. To throw evacuation Kidnapper! Pegasus, here is red 2, answer. Pegasus, here is red 2, answer. Yes, red 2, here it is Pegasus. Starbuck, which the situation? We are having little luck here. Tell me that possesses a ship waiting for us. She is already to I walk, red 2. The raiders interrupted the attack, and they owe to return for you at any moment. Understood. We are being without time. An evacuation kidnapper is to I walk. We have to arm the bomb and to give him/it out. That will be a problem. The detonator is definitively damaged. Can you create a manual acionamento? - Probably. - Then do. Do do? Is he/she speaking to what devils? We will complete this mission. Did I go clear, soldier? Yes, lady. Equip red, here it is Pegasus. The ship will arrive in 2 minutes. Here it is red 2, happen for the commander. Red 2, here he/she is the commander. What is delaying so much he/she? Starbuck, are arriving the any instant! The detonator of the bomb is damaged, and we will have to work manually. Red 1 are still in the command, the one that not in the clue many options. Which are their orders, gentleman? We still have a missile in the tube. If the rescue ship arrives, we can still detonate that thing. Sr. Hoshi... The raiders are in defense position. Any thing that you to throw it will be intercepted by them. Then we will have that to leave somebody back and to arm the ogiva manually. He/she is correct. This is his/her team, son. It is you who decides. Red 2, here it is it commander of Pegasus. Catch the SHOO, catch their men, and go for the extraction coordinates. Leave their men in safety, later detonate the bomb through the manual command. Complete his/her mission, captain. Understood. Sergeant! Get ready to leave of here. Come, stand up. You will remove of here. We go, everybody inside, we go there! We go there, fast! You also, major removes... You also, captain. Leave the bomb here, for kindness. What shit is he/she making? I am completing the mission. Catch that. No longer I need that more. Major... I think I gave him/her an order, soldier. Unless he/she wants to die, I suggest that you obey me. Go. Why? You know the reason very well. Why doesn't save his/her breath before it ends? That is everything, captain. All this already happened, and it will happen again. Among, major. I am waiting for you for a long time. Do you know of what is treated, it is not? What are you? What am I? A man. Or will I be a machine? My children believe that I am a god. And you are... a god? I have been seeing things... his/her life, captain Shaw. The things that you did... the things that he/she thought that he/she had to do. Everything culminated for this moment. Do you want to be forgiven, my child? I repeat: We will execute these orders. We will shoot in these people. What are making, gentleman? Do you want to be forgiven? Yes. Then approach. He/she has something that I need count him. Come. Kara Thrace will drive the human race for his/her end. How? She is the herald of the apocalypse, the precursor of the death. She should not be proceeded. Pegasus, extraction Kidnapper beginning return. Completed extraction. The Kidnapper is in the way back. They are with Starbuck on board. Major Shaw was back. Starbuck? Commander... here it is red 1. Answer. Red 1, here he/she is the commander. What does happen he/she? Commander, I need to alert him/it. Regarding captain Thrace. - Red 1, continue! - They are blocking the sign again, gentleman. Red 1, here he/she is the commander. Answer. We lost the contact. Commander... do answer.? Now my existence he/she reaches the end... just to resume for ignored forms. You are afraid, it is not, his/her son of the mother? He/she has reason to be. All this already happened, and it will happen again. It is again... and again... and again... and again... and again... and again... and again... Did you want to see me, admiral? Thank you for coming here. Starbuck was here before a little. He recommended me one posthumous homage for Shaw. She was not interested in medals. He/she is right, it was not. But I was looking at the registrations of Cain and under tactical point of view, it is difficult to find a flaw in which she has been doing. What did Kendra make? They massacred innocent civilians, father. We go there. How can it ignore that? The one that I know is that I didn't have that to face decisions as that. I had president in front of me, struggling for the survival of the civil fleet. I had colonel Tigh, to stay honest, to balance my morals and tactics. It is had still you. You don't have children, and he/she cannot understand that. But you one see contemplated in their eyes. And every time in that I thought to do something with that fleet... I held myself, therefore he/she knew that he/she would have to face him/it the following day. If you were not in C&C, I would have salary that attack. Kara would be dead, as the rest of the team. You didn't do wrong. Nor me. Both of us took choices for to complete our missions. I know. As Cain and Kendra. Were they wrong? If I believed in God, I would say that will be judged by a larger power... But since you don't believe? The history will have to judge them. And since the first draft of the history it is written in our registrations... Good, I believe that I have something to write then. And regarding that homage? Yes, I will do. It is not a lot of thing to show how fruit of a life, not? I have faith that not. Does he/she have some idea why she made that? Maybe she thought that he/she had that to answer for their actions. Maybe have deserved. All deserved. Best to hear that of me. I requested transfer of turn to the Galactic. Some special reason? Yes, you can say that have one obstinacy with my superior official. And the one what would that be? The mother's son is trying to kill me. Did he/she already think that can be for desert? Speak for you same, Lee. I have a destiny. A cylon read my palm of the hand, doesn't he/she remember? A destiny, right. It is better to believe. Therefore I think won't get to get rid of me before the end. I will present him/her his/her new CAG. Mister. Translation of the audio and sincronismo: LMP Leave his/her evaluation and comment in the site Battlestar Galactic turn in 04/2008
