If you can't sleep, just count the taxis. 25, 26... This pharmacy is incredible. - Isn't it? Can you please zoom? Your favorite neon-green. Specially for you. - Great. Apple of my eye MADOU PHARMACY Hello there, how are you? - Great. You? I'm fine. I get by. I went to the seaside today, with a friend. Back to work tomorrow. Still, what we've had they can't take away from us, eh? You're right. - Hang on a minute. Look at this. Feel it. It's soft, isn't it? It's fleece. Hold that, I'll just... Look. Practical, huh? - Yes. Here. - No, that's for you. Thank you. - Pity Mireille's already gone. You could send it. - We could. That's a good idea, eh? - I'll see. In America it can be cold 'til mid-June. - I know. Sleep tight. - Thanks. No more bets! Mark. No. I've got a problem. I think someone's using my network. I already have. It's off. Do you know anyone who can help? Kriku? Is that the name? Give me his number. How are things there? Some other time. I'm too tired. No, I've got a tough day tomorrow. Sure. Definitely. See you soon. See you soon. Bye. The plexiglass is lovely. But the red's a bit too intense. - That red is cool. Remember what you yourself once said? If the grass was red, everyone would go mad. You said it. Have you been to Lower East Side yet? - I've only been here for a week. Next Thursday: Midlake. No excuses. - I've got a Zaha Hadid reading. You don't have to go to that. Have you seen the plans for her Antwerp project? Yes. - Absolutely hopeless. It's... Spielberg meets Duplo. That's it. So, next Friday: Tonic Room. The night train's here. Sweet dreams, prince. - You too. See you soon. See you now. See you now. "Skyping with the camera on makes me sad, sweetheart. OK with you if we leave it off?" "Good idea, darling! Sweet dreams." Katia speaking, how may I help you? - I'd like to block my visa card. Is it in your name? - Yes. Have you got the number? - Yes, just a moment. Watch out, eh! Sorry. And your name is? - Samuel Verbist. Could you spell that? Yes. V-E-R-B-I-S-T. Verbist, OK. Thank you. Medical supplies- Frequent Stops Hello. Bye. See you soon. I'm kidding. How's Mireille? - It's hard, but she's learning a lot. Good. - I bet she is. New York is a fantastic city. What exactly is she doing there? - Working in an architect's office. Watch out she doesn't settle there. - Mike! Go on. - Thank you. Good night. - Good night. Hello, it's Kriku. - I'm on the 4th floor. Do you think someone's trying to crack my system? Crack? - Hack it, I mean. I don't know. We'll see. I've had my credit card blocked just to be sure. You'll need a new password. I'd advise you to include a typing error in your password. Typing error? - Aspelling mistake. Like, 'school' with a 'k', or 'plough' with a 'w'. It confuses them. Is it OK now? - I don't know. We'll see. Could you switch the modem off? Wait about ten seconds before switching it back on. Niki. I was on early shift on Tuesday and Wednesday, too. Yes. I just hope that dispatching doesn't mess everything up. I don't want to get caught in the rush hour again. Yes. At 2 o'clock. Is that your girlfriend? Yes. - She's called Mireille, isn't she? Do you know her? - I went to St-Luc with her. She's working in New York now? Cool. I knew she'd go far. - Really? The best thing would be to reinstall your operating system. I'd have to come back with an external drive. But your network is protected. You'll have no more intrusions. Great. What do I owe you? - 40. A message for you. One day, we'll be able to grab messages from the air. No more computers. Yeah? Here. Good night. "Hello, sweetie, still awake?" "Still working. Can't talk now." "Deadline..." "I'll explain later, hon." You don't have a kid but you have to register. We didn't know and only registered after 3 months. We're on a waiting list with Dikkertje Dap, 't Dolfijntje and Stampertje. Now we have to wait to find out if we've actually got a place. Samuel! - Coming. Samuel. Come on. - Here I am. Subject: cross roots Kriku, my ass. Hello, darling. - Hello, sweetie. Up already? - I'm on early shift. I had to replace someone. I wanted to say good night. How are things there? - Tough, but it's a cool team. I even got a compliment from Sanders today. That's no surprise! How are things there? You're very quiet. Everyone's still asleep. Only morons like me are awake. Sam, no one said you have to stay in that job until you're 40. As soon as I get work in NY, I'll... Sam! - I'll be over. Sorry, I didn't mean to... I haven't had enough sleep. I've been having trouble with the computer. The computer? - Yes. Someone on my network. A hacker or something. I had somebody come round, but now I can't even log in. Switch that thing off and think about me. I can't switch it off, I receive my schedule by mail. Yes, that's true. Oh, sweetheart! Maybe you should get someone else in to look at it. And say... Don't worry... I can't hear you anymore. Mireille! Reverse vertigo. - Reverse vertigo? What's he doing? - Measuring frequencies. Where's it coming from? Everywhere. What now? This is your perfect anti-aircraft gun. You'll be safe with this. Is it someone in the building? Is the hacker someone from here? - That's Liesbeth. They're viruses. - Viruses? Yes. That's why it's important to do an automatic scan weekly. An automatic scan? - We're coming to the caf now, OK? August. - August? The middle of August. - And what is it? We don't know. - Come on, tell. No, I don't know. I like not knowing. I don't believe you. - I don't know. I can't tell you. I won't tell anyone else. - But I don't know. Here he is! - Here's the mussels. We need a refill. You can really hear the sea in this. That's an old joke. - No, it's not. It's the shell principle. What is it? - Whaddizt? More Trappist! We don't know, really. - Yes you do! No, we don't! - As long as it doesn't look like you... I didn't say that. - She just said so before you got here. We'll find out soon enough. We're going out for chips. - I'm in. Sorry to bother you. This is for you. - No, that's not necessary. Could you make two copies? On both sides. Evelyne has made the place pretty. That looks good, the green with the flowers. The light's on in the attic. Isn't that your landlord's place? Yes, that's Verdonck's room. How's it going without Muriel? - Mireille. Chin up. How much longer? Ten weeks. - It'll go quickly. It's good to miss each other, hunger is the best sauce. These machines are unbelievable. Is the original there? Yes. - There, look. Listen, I've decided to give my body to science when I die. My family mustn't find out. It's none of their business. That way they won't have to come. They mustn't know when I die. But don't let me bother you. Thanks. We'll surely drink to this, eh? Thanks, my lamb. See you. Good morning, miss. I'm Dsir d'Ostende, eldest son of Roger van Diepenbeek and Ninette d'Aubrey-sur-Saintiplisse in Auvergne. I weighed 200 grams! Dsir... - Then dad had the idea of putting me in a chocolate box on the steps of the Ursuline hospital in Ostend. I need to speak to Samuel, right away. I'll hand you over to my colleague who speaks better Russian than me. Keprotsjka youssa jebrim? Samuel, hello! I have good news! I can present my project. - I knew it. Really? Flexible Division Def 3D. - Yes, Def 3D. Look in there. Flexible Wall System. - Yes, that's it! Great. Could you send it to me? - Yes. I told you it was a great idea. Thanks. I thought you didn't want to skype with webcam any more. I know... But I had to see you. Silly! - Present me to your colleagues. Sammy, I can't. - Why? Because I haven't shaved yet? Come on, introduce me. She seems nice. - Yes, really nice. One more minute! Wait! Specially for you. It's grown, eh? - Yes. This is Verdonck. You tried to call me? Yes, to tell you about the light in the attic. Yes, Mrs. Luyckx told me. What did you say? I've rented the room, Sam, because I'm not often in Brussels. But you promised that room to Mireille. - Really? She needs that space to store her models. I've already rented the room to John Everts. Perhaps he'll sublet it to you, if you ask him in your best English. I must be off, Sam. I had something to say, but I've forgotten. Silly, eh? Liesbeth is pregnant. "Hey, sweetie. Are you awake?" "What was Coney Island like? Want to hear your voice. Going to leave this dumb job... and do what I really want, love you full time!" "So lovely! Who was the lucky photographer?." Is it safe? I wouldn't do that. Isn't that poisonous? Is it safe? I make a model, you take care of the papers. Shit! sun record "OK, Sam. I will - M" to reject: give someone the push, dump them. "Darling Mireille, I didn't write that!" Shit! No, they've broken up. Sam told me himself. New York? What are you going to do there? I was thinking about the red plexiglass. Mark. - Samson, am I disturbing you? No. - Want to go jogging later? No, I'm still busy here. OK. Heard anything from Mireille? - Nothing. I wouldn't insist if I was you. She'll beg you to come, you'll see. Right. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Exactly! Is the new modem working OK? Yeah, great. - I spoke to David again, he can come over Friday or Saturday to double-check everything. If you'd like him to. - Yes, great. Have you got his number? - Yes. OK, comrade, I'll be off. - Bye. "Darling Mireille..." I brought you some bread buns. I made them this morning with Mum. These are currant buns... a sesame bun, a poppy seed bun, three chocolate cookies, a brown loaf and some banana bread. - Thanks! There you are. - Thank your mother. Yes, I will. - Thanks. Hey, Dad. - Samuel? Is something wrong? - No. I'm ringing with grandma's phone. With grandma's phone? At 3:30 in the morning? Have you gone crazy? - I lost track of time. Samuel, how are you? Not too many words. How are you? - Me? No, not too many words. How are you? Better than you. - Yes. This thing works well. Can you hear the plane? Hear it? In 4 minutes it'll be at your place. I'll just have to go down to the air-raid shelter. Who is it? - Nothing, it's Samuel. He forgot what time it was. The time difference with New York has got me confused. But how are you? I lay awake all night, but I slept very well. I was tortured by a chiropractor. And my liver... I don't want to talk about it. You know my motto... "You can avoid most ailments... ...by dying young." I'd better get a move on, then. Jacqueline wants to know if you're coming on Sunday. She likes to know 3 days in advance so she can order the rabbit. But I don't like rabbit, she knows that. Me, me, me. I like rabbit! You can have fish sticks, I'll have rabbit. Jacqueline does her best, so I'll expect you to be there. Dad? "Mireille, my darling, I've been fired..." Mireille! Zeeland? Has Mireille called? For tips. You know New York. If you've no news, you mustn't call. ... that you look at yourself when you try on your shoes, the time you take to choose, that you visit my grandfather, the shadow under your eyes, the raspberries... ... visit my grandfather, the shadow under your eyes, that you think raspberries taste the same as walnuts, that you don't like olives, that you brush your teeth four times a day, your yellow pullover, that you never gave me back my scarf, your calves when you go up the stairs, the way you rearrange your hair, your white espadrilles in Marseille that I spilled Coke on. It made you angry... What you said in Rotterdam, when we missed the last train, that you mix up Axelle Red and Vanessa Paradis, the ventilator you gave me, that you never turn the radio off in the middle of a sentence, that you never dance... ... that you never dance on the beat, your kindness towards Mark, that you only smoke 5- 6 cigarettes a year, that you don't walk straight... The sadness that comes over you when you realize it's later than you thought, that's what I like about you. That you never look at your watch when we're together. Everything about you... It's Mark. Open up, pal. I'm not there! Yes, I had noticed. I think that radiation isn't good for you. But I might have a solution. Schumann frequencies. The radiation won't go away, but it gets neutralized. You'd better stay away. The Schumann frequency generator is in front of your door. OK? Give it a try. And I've spoken to Mireille. She misses you. She's written you a letter. Thanks for the conviviality. "I want to see you as soon as possible but not in Brussels nor in New York. On neutral ground. Somewhere we can't be reached. Kisses."
