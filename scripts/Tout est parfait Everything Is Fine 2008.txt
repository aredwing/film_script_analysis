Light shines Through darker days Eyes close And lose their way Slip away the night While the whole town's asleep Caught between the space Where you wanted to be Death acts And life reacts Spent time Turning Looking back Clues along the track Leave the following kind Over ground that seems to be new Winding up the same Every time Argh! Mr Dagenais? Mr Dagenais? What do you want? Thomas must be downstairs. No... There's been an accident. What have you two done now? You're always pulling dumb shit. Huh? Thomas?! Thomas?! Rock-a-bye baby In the tree top When the wind blows The cradle will rock I called. They didn't say anything? Huh? Your friends, I mean. I mean, you were always... What do you know about friends? Got any? All we want to know is if... The school psychologist says you should talk to someone. Can we please just get through this day? OK. My condolences. My condolences. Maybe we should go back in. Yeah. Get me a drink, Corporal Dagenais. No, that's OK. I wanted to ask you... Ahem. Did you know anything? - If I'd known, I would've done something. He seemed OK. Excuse me. I don't understand. Finally. Fly to Afghanistan for it? That'll kill you. Fuck you. It's Mia, right? Josh. Did you know? What? That he'd... Do like Sash? I dunno. You five always hung together. Don't exaggerate. Exaggerate? Even when I was seeing Sasha I couldn't chill with you. It wasn't that bad. They didn't leave anything either? Not that I heard. - Christ, they could've at least left a letter! Can I have one, Josh? Yeah, sure. Scram, it's my last one. 'Kay. Fuck you. Who's he? - Alex's brother... his half-brother. Vincent, I think. Christ. Want to go? Ah, man... I can't. Get someone to buy it for you. Look, I don't have time. You don't. No. I won't sell it to you. Why you busting my balls? You always let us. What's the problem? I'm assistant manager now. Wow. That's cool, Ral. So, you're up to, what, $9 an hour? About that. Cool. So you can't buy it. OK... What if I give you the money and you buy it? OK. We haven't come here in ages. Since grade 6. No, high school. It was summer. I was seeing Sasha and you were with Melanie. Melanie... No, you and I came here again. After Gobeil's party. Christ, I got into shit that time. Me too. Look, I still have a scar. Sasha did that to you? Why'd they do it? Huh, Josh? I dunno. No more than you. Bye. Fuck, Sash! - Ex's have always been forbidden territory. Fucking asshole! You dumped her. Makes no difference. It's you who sets the rules, huh? Did you smack Mia too? Just follow the rules. We're pals, OK? Go fuck yourselves! I hate you! City full of bastards! Arghhh! Why aren't you with us? Josh, I'm not here... to tell you what to do. I'm here to listen. So listen. Did you hear anything? I hear a lot of anger. I hear sadness too. So you're a kind of medium? You hear voices and all? No. Anyway, it's not what I hear, it's what you have to say. It's that I'm forced to be here. I understand you don't... want to talk about it yet. To talk about what happened. What happened? - What happened to your friends. To Sasha, first. What about Sasha? Josh! It's no coincidence. You know, I know, everyone does. To Sasha and then to... Simon, Thomas... Alex. Yeah, Alex. Want to talk about Alex? Why? You didn't know him. No, but you knew him. Ah... 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. - The refractive index gives the opacity of a substance. Which is why light rays crossing from air into water abruptly change direction... - Hey. - So what's up? Dude, about time. Sorry, man. OK, let's move. No, seriously, where were you? I waited 10 minutes. - The crazy bitch wouldn't let me go. - Simple enough. Tell her to fuck off. - You nuts? Two days later my dad gets a letter... Don't you go through the mail? No, I don't go through the mail. - Slow! You smoke too much weed. Know how many letters I've chucked? Not bad. Hold on a sec. Good job, good job! Rondeau! Rondeau! Go around it! Fuck you, goddamn jock! C'mon, let's go. Hi. - Yeah. - I was passing by. Can I come in? Do you play golf? - Not really. - Course not. Want me to explain? - Sure. - Grab a beer. Thanks. What's a...? Shh! What's what? - Huh? - Your question. Oh, uh... A birdie. What's a birdie? - When you get it in the hole one stroke under. Under what? - Depends. There's par 3, par 4, 5... What's par? That's the standard. Who decides what standard is? It depends on the course. The distance, difficulty, obstacles... - And wind? - No, not the wind. No? But the wind can make your... - Not the wind, fuck. In baseball or tennis do they account for wind? - I dunno. - No, they don't. OK, cool. Shit! That's sick, man! You're not in bed? Start your front side indy sooner. What? I was doing a 50-50. Yeah? Sure didn't look like it. Gimme a smoke. Fuck you, man. Hey. Hey. Hi. - Jeez, did you just run a marathon? I had a practice. What kind of practice? Dance. Oh yeah? Taking dance? Look, I saw you spying on me. Spying? Don't exaggerate. What're you up to? Showering, then math. I kinda thought... Showering, then mall. I'll shower and come meet you. Yes, sir. I didn't plan to go shopping. What did you want to do? I dunno, but definitely not shop! Gonna buy them? - No. Damn. They're so not my style. No, they're cute. Cute? So, what, he asks you questions? Yeah, but not really. - So you ask him questions? - No. So you sit staring for two hours? - Sort of. Except it lasts an hour. He gets fed up. I think he just graduated. Thanks. Great psychologist. No, he's smart. He's OK. - Did you swipe them? - No. I put 'em on my Platinum Visa. What a jerk! Thank you, Josh. Hi, Mia. Hi. You finished? - Sure. 20 some years is a long walk Even if it's not in a straight line You see a lot of things in the distance Y'know what they say about great minds You and I think about the same things Dream the same dreams play the same games We started out in the same place Believe it or not we've got the same names Everything happens for a good cause Whether it be victory or loss And the road may turn into a runway But you don't know what to do someday Trust me I've seen it all before I've climbed to the tops Of the tallest trees To get away from the deep water To find a touch of the smallest breeze Go find the girl with a low voice Who holds the world in her bare hands You'll fall in love you'll have no choice Once you are given a fair chance For the first time you will sleep well Take a deep breath see the sun shine Hold on to her for dear life And then watch the whole world unwind Ask her to show you some magic And I guarantee that she'll say yes Give it to me. Give it! Give it! Fuck. - What? - I've a practice. - When? - Like, now. It's no joke. Hurry! Hey, man. Chucking his stuff? Want anything? No, that's OK. So are you going back to Iraq soon? - Afghanistan. - Yeah, right. In two days. That must be pretty heavy. Yeah, pretty. Well, ciao. Mm? How was school today? Only one person here goes to school. Super cool. Which classes did you have? I don't remember. - Make any new friends? - No. A girlfriend? Nope. What are you doing? Damn! I can't believe it. You're just jealous. - You bet I am. Being paid to do graffiti. I'm paid to make art. What's the diff? The difference is, if I wasn't paid, the cops'd be after me. What's it called... that thing you're in, the program? Community Explorations in Art as Leisure and... Anyway. OK. Fuck. Do you ever draw anything besides cyclops and sparrows and stuff? - No, I like cyclops. It's like they see better than us. Where do you come up with that? I dunno. Wait, I'll try closing one eye. It's true. It's true you see better. With one eye your painting is amazing. Seen like this, I'd even call it art. Shut up! C'mon, grab your cans. I was wondering... Do you think cyclops have just one nut? Are you shitting me? Maybe. Christ! Ah... Goddamn idiot! What's the idea? There's a guy who buys them. He... He resells them. - Scumbag! - Stop! I think I broke my ankle. Would you give me a sip please? Don't feel like it. OK. Hello. Hi. What's her name? Lindsay. Hello, Lindsay. - By the way, next time you want to buy beer, be more subtle. There are cameras. I made an exception for the funeral. - Fine. Want a club card? I stamp it each time. The tenth coffee... - No, I don't want it, thanks. Why not? I dunno, I just don't. A free coffee. That's great, but no thanks. - It's free. Just take it. What's your problem? Just put it in your pocket. What a loser. - First time a guy invites me on a picnic. Cool. Sure you've come here before? Sure. But I wasn't always driving, so... We passed here before. We have not. You're lost. No, it's here. Oh, yeah. It's right here. We're there. - What do you mean? We have to walk a bit. Mia? What? If you were a flower, what kind? Cut it out. C'mon, just answer. I dunno. An iris. Cool. If you were a gemstone? - How do I know? Next question. There are lots more. Who's your favorite movie hero? Neo. - In The Matrix? - Yeah. Nice. Good choice. Your favorite hero in real life? Hubert Reeves. The dude who plays Superman? - What a jerk. - I'm joking. Do you have a poster of a movie star in your room? If so, who? I can feel Brad Pitt here. Worse. C'mon, spit it out. Who? Bo Bice. Who? Bo Bice. From American Idol. Did he win American Idol? - No, he didn't win, but he was on it. - You chose the loser? - Screw you! The water's gross. You're going to swim in it? That's the idea. Will you if it's warm? No way. What's he up to? Ahem. This isn't funny. Josh! Shit. It's not funny! Fuck you! - Come on. - Fuck you! Hey... Mia... I didn't mean to scare you. I do that in my bath. Take me home. Come on. Take me home! - OK, OK. - Fuck you! We drove by here before. You're just like Sasha. You screw up, then apologize and think everything's OK. I didn't apologize. You've a pretty visitor. I'll see you in the morning. Bye. - Bye. "Why?" Why does there have to be a reason? - People don't do things without a reason. Not serious things like that. Serious. Don't you think it's serious? Four of your friends killed themselves. - Is it that important, in the big scheme? Stop looking like you pity me. They didn't want pity. Me neither. - No? - No. They did something they chose to do. Think what you like. I don't judge them. Yeah, right. They never spoke to you about... their plan? Pff... I don't remember. Don't you want to understand? - No, you want to! Why don't you get it? Huh? You want to understand. - OK, let's say I want to understand... - Then it's your damn problem. See a psychologist. Y'know, Josh... you're not being honest with me. - No, I'm not honest with you one bit. Do you know where your girlfriend is right now? Your goddamn clock's wrong. There. Dammit! - I never understood them. - What? - Bugs. Why do they trip on light like that? Are you stoned? - No, check it out. The big one's going crazy. It's not like it helps them. They don't budge. It warms them. It's warm enough, shit. No, it must be like a big party for them, man. Something like that. A party? - A huge fucking rave. With a light show and everything. The whole shebang. - And when the rave's over and the lights go out? They fuck their brains out, duh! A fucking bug group grope! Well, it's fucking beautiful. - Hi, Mia. - Hi. - I like your hair. - Thanks. The blonde was temporary. It comes to $32.31. Drop by the house for a coffee. You must be busy with this, school and all. If you ever have time. Sorry. I may have stuff... I can give you. Bye, hon. Take care. You too. Genevieve? You OK? I don't know why he left you. You were great together. He still loved you. - Maybe. Some people... think Sasha talked the others into it. No. Nobody talked anyone into it. I'm sure of that. I should've seen something. I didn't see a thing. There's a dream that I see I pray it can be Look cross the land shake this land... - Did I ever tell you about my dad? I was 8. He'd taken me bicycling for the day. He took me in his arms and kissed me and gave me five bucks. He said to go buy candy at the store. When I came back... he wasn't there. My mom was standing outside, bawling her eyes out. She said not to go upstairs. I understood. So I went upstairs and saw my father. He'd hung himself in the closet. He was already blue. And me... I've seen his face every day since I was 8. I can't hack it. I can't hack it, man. So we've got nothing to lose We can all be free Maybe not with words Maybe not with a look But with your mind You've got to choose a wish or command At the turn of the tide is withering thee... Beats Kibble, huh? Remember one thing the dream you can see Pray it to be shake this land We all do what we can So we can do Just one more thing We can all be free Maybe not with words Maybe not With a look But with your mind But with your mind Ah! Hey. Not in school? - No, it's a ped day. - Are you sick? No, I have a pedagogical day. Do you ever... like, play on a golf course? - Too many people, like. - OK. Wanna try? I dunno. Yeah, I'd love to. - It's a golf club, Gretzky, not a hockey stick. Hands closer together. - Like this? - Place your feet perpendicular to the trajectory. Bend your knees a bit. Good. Your eyes always on the ball. Man. Shit. I'm sorry. Are you making fun of me? I smashed your window. - So what? Just get the driver - the club. I'll show you how. - Is your dad good at golf? - Yeah, the basement's full of trophies from when he was like 30. Did he teach you? You crazy? No way I'd play. Golf's a boring sport for old farts. But my brother plays. - Is he good? - He's really good, goddamn jerk. - What's he doing now? Isn't he... far away, like in Iraq? - Afghanistan. - Right. What's he doing there? What's his job? - I dunno, something with terrorists. They're protecting pipelines, strategic interests. I bet they have piles of hash. For sure, man. Johnson Poupart. - For you, golf... Nicely played! is it chill? Do you like it? Is that what chill means? What's it mean? - It means... - What? Do you even know what chill means? Not really! It means it's cool. - Cool? - Yeah, all those words. - Great vocabulary. - Yeah, it's chill. Not bad, man. Ahem. I have something for you. At least they'll be used. It's really nice, but... I don't think I can accept. They're brand new! Know how much I paid? That's not the point. They weren't for me. I can't. What'll I do with them? Bury 'em in the cemetery? Beat it. Scram. Hello? What are you doing? - Nothing. - Are you hanging in front of my place by chance? - No, it's just... Where are you? I'm on my way. Uh... I wanted to apologize for the other day. - For the quarry, the diner, or in the car? Yeah, that too, but... Seriously, I didn't mean to make you freak, okay? - Look, I just don't want to lose it cause of someone. I don't want that. Come on. Don't take it that way. Hey! It's OK. I deleted it yesterday. What? Sasha, from my cell. Did you delete them? No. It's not funny. Stop. Listen. Christ, what a dummy. Delete their numbers, Josh. OK. Hello. Hi, how's it going? Hold on a sec. Yeah, sorry. Cool! Who'll be there? Yeah, I'd like that. I'll ask him and call you back. See you later. Bye. That was Cath. She's having a party. I'll be back, OK? Sorry. Fucking line for the can. - That bad? I had to go in the bushes. You making a documentary? The ravages of drugs. - Admit you're making a film about ducks. Ducks are hot. Yeah, right. Yeah! Whoo-hoo! - Not to bug you wimps, but the party's there. - Not to bug you wimps, but I came to bug you with my attitude. What's your problem? - What's yours? Two beers and you want to get smacked? Rondeau, for YouTube! Put that away! Relax, man! You've got a problem! - Get your team and we'll settle this. The guy's a fucking idiot. Grab me another one. Don't get involved. Sure I'll get involved. - Just get me another beer. - You're crazy, man. I'll go get the beer. I'll come with you. If we can make it back. Josh, keep an eye on Thomas. Don't worry. Check, dude.
