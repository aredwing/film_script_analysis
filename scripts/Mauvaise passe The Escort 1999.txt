What's going on? Nothing. I know it's late. Put Nicolas on. Nicolas? Isn't he with you? He left Bordeaux at 6. I hope he's OK. No delays at the airport. Don't worry. I'm not at home. Where are you? I'm not in Paris. Where? London. I'll explain, Dad. London? Why? Are you all right? Fine. I'll explain. Go back to bed. Sure you're OK? Yes, don't worry. Bye now. "I journey to verify my dreams." Hi. Catherine and Nicolas are out right now. Leave a message and we'll call you back. Hi, Catherine. It's Pierre. I'm still in London. I hope you're managing all right. Catherine, how are you? Sorry? How are you? Why are you calling? What do you want? To ask how you both are. That's all. No kidding? Which do you prefer? That I sing all day or that I'm suicidal? Which would help you find yourself? Isn't that what your fax meant? I know it's hard, but don't take it this way. I know I've made you unhappy. I think about it constantly. Poor dear. Even long distance, I make your life hell. Can you ever forgive me, or your son who's probably sorry he exists. Stop this, Catherine. I'm very unhappy. I don't understand. Now you know how we are. Enjoy London. Have fun. Try to understand. I'm lost. How old are you? How old? I'm sure that you find me incomprehensible. I've been cruel to your mother, abandonned you. I would so like to explain. Here is the address and number of the place I'm working. My only pride, my only achievement is you. I love you, Nicolas, and miss you terribly. "Like a great alcove, the sky slowly darkens "In impatient man a wild beast harkens "O night... "kind night... "Desired by he whose arms without deceit, may repeat: "Today we have laboured "Here comes the charming night, friend to the criminal..." Nicolas! Wait! - When did you get here? - This morning, about 11. I'm happy to see you. Look out. How long are you staying? Until tomorrow. - Where you staying? - Friends of Marie. She come along? Is she well? You two get along? Yeah, fine. Look, I'll change and we'll get a drink. Now? I can't. Tonight. Let's have dinner. No, I can't tonight. OK, tomorrow. See that Thai restaurant? Meet you there at noon. Fine. I have to go. I was just leaving. Well, quickly. Come in. I'm sorry to rush you but I'm running late. This is the kitchen. Needs some freshening up. It's been 15 years. This is the living room. Here, you have a very pleasant dining room. A spacious bedroom with bath. We're in central Paris but it's quiet. As you see, plenty of closets. Now, on the other side, the 2nd bedroom. It's free now. The lease isn't up, but she's gone. Her husband left her, very sudden. So I'm told. The 2nd bedroom is the child's. Easily converted to an office. Lots of light. And it's very quiet. Excuse me. One minute. Hold on. I can't hear you. I'll be right there. I'm right nearby. Five minutes. Sorry, I must go. Anyway, you have the keys. Catherine. What do you want? To talk. I've nothing left to say. We have to talk. Please. Nicolas was in London. He didn't seem well. How sensitive you are now. So long. Please, let's go some place quiet. Leave me alone. I knew he went. Marie told me. Know what he told her? That he'd been with a ghost. As if his real father were dead. I'm trying to find myself. Screw the philosophy. Nicolas is the same, and he's lost. I'm the same. Nothing comes of lies. Ruined lives come of questions asked too late. I never lied to anyone. Not to you, my son... Shit. Sorry. We're wasting our time. I won't ask for a divorce, not yet. Nicolas doesn't need to see us fight over silverware. I feel worse with you here than without. By the way, I like your new look. Very cool. Just relax. Get off my fucking back! Fuck off, all of you! You OK? How is he? Better. He'll make it, but it was very close. The maid called me. She found him on the floor yesterday. Want a lift? Know how I found your number? I found this in a box in Nicolas' room. Lucky he didn't find it. Even I don't get it. I know it's not the moment, but I want that divorce. And Nicolas? How's he taking it? Very badly. He won't talk to me. Could I stay at home? Am I really that far-gone? You aren't, but I am. The blue sky may fall to the ground And the earth... collapse all around What do I care if you love me No one in this whole world counts... Processed by C.M.C. - Paris
