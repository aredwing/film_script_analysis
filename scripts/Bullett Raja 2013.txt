'So, I spent all my life getting into trouble.' 'But finally, I think I've met my match.' He was right here. Look that way. Greetings. - Bless you. Are you... going to settle for that colored drink? Or would you prefer something stronger? I would prefer something stronger. Then, that's where you will get it. Om Namah Shivay! Cheers! - Cheers! I am Rudra. Nandini's first cousin. And you? - Well, actually I'm the second cousin. But I'm closer to her than the first cousin. - I see. Everyone knows that. "There's just one temple of Lord Brahma in Pushkar. Why not? That's because Lord Brahma committed a big sin.. That's my uncle's Man Friday. Lallan Tiwari. He's been raised in this house. Cheers. The heroine's here. The hero's here! Amazing. Great. Can I tell you something? - What? I'm a gate-crasher. I wasn't invited. I got into trouble this morning. Some gang was chasing me. I saw the wedding procession and just joined in to lose them. I thought as much after seeing your attire. You didn't look like a guest. Wow, buddy. She's seriously flirting with you. I just danced with her. I didn't do anything else. And who's stopping you? Go ahead. Brother Rudra. Aunt's calling you. - Coming. I'll be back. Hello. Name? What's your name? Raja. Raja Mishra. Raja Mishra! You've been ogling me all day! If I tell my people they'll thrash you. Go ahead, I am not scared. You're not scared? Do you have a girlfriend? They don't last too long. - I don't want to either. Just a minute, hold on. First tell me your name? - What for? To note it down in my list. Number 155. You're a big hunter. Hunters kill animals. I awaken the animal inside us. I see. - Right. All set? - Yes. We have to finish this job in 30 minutes. - Yes. Our plan is, we barge into the house. And kill every member of the family. Do not hesitate. But, I will kill Parshuram personally. Look. We won't get this opportunity again. Listen! Hey! There's going to be an attack on this house! Lallan Tiwari is on his way here with 10 to 15 gunmen. What? - Rudra! Listen. Get in! Rascals, come on! Go that way. Brother. - Move back! Lallan! You traitor! Don't run! Shoot! Sir, he's my friend. I invited him. - Fine. But people say he arrived here with the groom's procession. What does that mean? - Look.. Sir. I'm neither a guest nor am I family. Yesterday I.. I got into a fight. Some gang was after me in a fight. I mingled with the procession to lose them and came in. Fine. Come with us to the station. SP sir, we should be showing gratitude to this boy.. And you're arresting him instead? I've a question, son.. Why risk your life for me? Rudra and I became friends. You risked your life for a friend you just made? And that traitor Lallan.. I raised him in this house since he was a child! I have a question, sir. If Lallan was your loyal Man Friday. Then, why did he do such a thing? Uttar Pradesh's politics has wiped out everybody's loyalty. Now, those who risk their lives for us.. Are the only loyalists. I was completely prepared, sir. Jagjivan's men were with me too. There was no room for mistake. Yet, those two boys outmatched your army! Why are there always two? What do you mean? I didn't get it. There were two in 'Sholay' as well, remember? Stop joking, sir. I've been humiliated, and you're ranting about 'Sholay'. Hey loser! You said you will eliminate that entire family. But you couldn't even kill a fly! And you got four of my men killed. Sir, if only it wasn't for these two.. Bipin! - Yes. Come here. Find them. Sir, I give you my word. You will surely reap marijuana.. In Parshuram's fields. If not, you can behead me. Anytime you want. And what will I do with your head? Right, it's useless. I'm more useful alive. First, I'll take care of those two boys. Sir, I never did hotel management. But I'll learn. If you prefer, you can appoint me on a temporary basis for a month. He'll wash dirty plates. Please father, I'm getting a job. Couldn't you find one earlier.. - No, not to you. Not to you. Yes, sir. I already sent you a bio-data yesterday. Yes. Thank you, sir. The police are here. What's wrong? This is you, right? Come down. Where will you take him? He's finally just found a job. Everything will be ruined. We'll just take him down to the station and get acquainted, that's all. Tell them we're on the way. Why did you do it? You were inviting trouble for yourself. It was just self-defense, nothing more. Come on, now you're in this mess for good. Come on. 6...7.. - May Allah bless you. Keep it. - Bless your family and children. Rudra. Deliver this parcel on the way. It's on your route. Why did you give him all that money? Because he needed it more than I. I can always earn more. - I see. Sit. Excuse me. Does Rudra Tripathi work here? - Yes. We're from his village. That's him, the one riding that bike. Rudra. He left. You can meet him here tomorrow. Stop. Stop. Stop. Get down. Get down. If it were up to me, I would've kept you in the zoo, not a jail. But, they called from up high. Now go. Go. Leave! Here you go. Get lost. Down there. Come on. Catch him. King Yudhishtir was a righteous king. King Yudhishtir... You can't go out now. Son, there's trouble brewing. I'm fasting for your well-being. Pray with me for a while. How long is it going to take? We fast for the children. And then, they try to boss us around. - Here you go. Hello, uncle. - Hello. He was the eldest of the Pandavas. Aren't you coming? Here, take my bike and go ahead. I'll join you soon. Aunt'!- I think that bullet had your name on it. It was meant for me? - Yes. Two men came looking for you after you left. Hello. - Hello, Raja? Call for you. Hello. - Hello, Raja. This is Rudra. Rudra, I was waiting for your call. My phone's shattered. I'm using my SIM-card in a different phone. I called to ask, is everything okay? - Not at all. The police attacked me! Did anything happen with you? Where are you? Uncle, I want this mess to end. So, we can continue our life normally. What was normal? You're a postman. And him. He's looking for a job. Even if he finds one, how much can he earn? Rupees 10,000? 20,000? So, what do you suggest? I suggest that you join my gang. - Your gang? You two are made for this. Stop it. How many times will I have to do it? It's paining. You're educated. It's difficult to find educated gangsters these days. Shut up! Uncle, this isn't possible. Please find another way. Fine, then go to jail? - Jail? I've spent few days in there earlier. When this matter calms down, you can come out. At least I'm not cleaning dirty plates. - No need to tell anyone. Tell them I've found a job. And I've gone to Delhi. And the ambiance here is better. It's not my fault. - No danger. Even/thing's okay. Better talk to uncle and explain to him. The food's warm, eat it. What a mess we're in! What? - What a mess we're in! So, would you like some entertainment to be organized? Another dance, perhaps? Should I arrange for that? Should I send you some pictures? Just leave. Your wishes can be fulfilled for just Rupees 5000. I said leave. Life's bad enough and.. There's one man that can solve your problem. My rate's 2000 rupees. They're really furious. I suggest that you apologize. Otherwise. Will you hold on? This is for you. Yes, sir. Better take his case, otherwise he'll get the next date. Hokum Singh.. - Mr. Srivastav. Yes. - This is Rudra and he's Raja. I'll call you back in half an hour. Thank you, sir. Sit. Akhand Veer's gang is after us.. - Hold on. Yes, Jaggi. I know there's an inquiry ongoing. There was an inquiry against me too. And I came in here. To follow High Commands orders. I became the scapegoat. I don't want to talk about it. Don't call me again. What were you saying? Akhand Veer's men are after us. Especially, Lallan Tiwari. I know. Kill those rascals. Sir, we don't want to resort to violence. We're not outlaws. You aren't outlaws. You two are... political commandos. Just like the army that protects the country. Similarly, those running this country. Need protection as well. Bureaucrats and politicians, they also need security. Do you agree? These days, you two are the talk of the town. We don't want to be gangsters, sir. Think about it. Greetings, sister-in-law. - Welcome, brother. Why didn't sister come along? She's still upset because our daughter just left. - Okay.. I apologize... for staging an attack on your home. That's okay, but you chose the wrong day. It was my daughter Nandini's wedding. It wasn't my plan. It was Lallan Tiwari's. I know. Where is Lallan Tiwari? Bring Lallan out. Let me go. - Come on. Let me go. If anything happens to me, there'll be a riot. Brother. This man's a bigger traitor than me! Get lost. Take him away. - Forgive me.. Where are you taking him? -it's my first mistake. Forgive me. Leave his punishment up to me. How about a drink now? It's getting warm. You still like drinking sugarcane-juice. I can have it any time of the day. Before I leave, I would like to see Lallan's body. Yes, of course. Look, that's him. Few men stopped Divya at college and.. How many were they? - Five. Around five boys. What were they asking? Your whereabouts. Thank God, her Professor saw everything. Otherwise, I wonder what. I'll see what I can do. A few men cornered my sister in her college. Are the arrangements okay? Ls everyone there? So, when do we have to leave? I am ready. What's going on? Are you going somewhere? Lallan Tiwari has killed uncle and his men. And, we aren't safe either. Now? I know where he is. He's gone hunting in the jungle with Akhand Veer and his sycophants. That's where we'll kill him covertly. What's the point in killing them silently now? It's important that everyone known. That Raja and Rudra killed them. This is my personal battle. Look, they misbehaved with my sister. The police barged into my home! They made me run like a dog. Tried to kill me! So, this is my fight too. Well, I can forget... but my anger won't let me. Remember. A rogue Brahmin... is a devil unleashed. Come back here after you finish the job. I like what I am seeing. Stop. Stop. Stop. Have you heard the story of Lord Brahma? - Do tell us. You see... He's got just one temple, in Pushkar. Because he committed a grave sin.. For which he was cursed. How did the tyre burst? Don't run. You need to tell everyone this story. My name is Raja Mishra. And, the other gunman is Rudra. Raja and Rudra. From today, we'll be notorious. Get up. You killed my uncle. And my friend too. Now, it's your turn. Say goodbye. This isn't like the movies where your guns have unlimited ammunition. Recognize him? He's Lallan the traitor. So, how are you going to tell this story? There was once a traitor called Lallan.. Who betrayed his own benefactor. Now go, run away. Get lost. Where are you going? He's all yours. What are you doing, Rudra? Forgiveness is the best policy. Forgive me. - Hold on. Hold on. Don't you tell that story about Lord Brahma? Now, finish that story. Raja, have you lost it? Now, you're going to hear stories from him? Of course. Before he dies I want to know what Lord Brahma's sin was. Tell us.. Why don't we pray to Lord Brahma? Lord Brahma's.. And.. - And that's why he was cursed. What. - Shoot him. Now, pray to Lord Brahma. Say it aloud... Hail Lord Brahma. Hail Lord Brahma. Say it louder, Hail Lord Brahma! I can't tolerate vulgarity in religious matters. Right, buddy. You never said anything wrong. And, what was that you said. Raja and Rudra the notorious. That's nice. Get some rest. We don't want to rest. We want to kill Akhand Veer next. Don't get so impatient. There's a difference between. A gangster and a political commando. You two need political protection. Hello, brother. - That's your job. I am not a politician. I am a political adviser. A consultant. To kill Akhand Veer.. You'll need asylum with an inuential politician. And I know of just such a politician who needs you two. Who? Rambabu Shukla. Rambabu is the most influential Minister of the Opposition. He's highly respected. He wants to get rid of Minister Nathuram permanently. She's getting married. Nathuram is a big pervert. He gave Sumer Yadav, the assassin, a contract to kill him. And, Sumer's famously known for.. Never missing a target. That's how accurate his aim was. Was? Is he dead? The police are after him. So he's playing a charade of pretending to be insane. He says "I am Radha". - What? Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna! Sumer Yadav is delaying Rambabu's contract. So if you two can kill Nathuram. "Then, Rambabu will give you refuge. And Akhand Veer's all yours. And the entire security of Uttar Pradesh. Will be in the palm of your hands. Make a plan. We don't need a plan to press the trigger, we need guts. And we've no dearth of it. Just arrange for some Holy Water. H holy Water? What's this mess outside my house? Mr. Sharma, when you can't even clean my house. How can you keep the city clean? Clean it up. - We'll do it now, sir. It'll be done. Don't worry. Watch. - Excuse me, sir. Wait. - Sir. I'm from Delhi, Breaking News TV. - Yes. Yes. If we can get just 15 minutes with Nathuram sir.. We'll interview him for our TV show 'Walk the Talk'. And, if you want to get anything done in Delhi, just tell us. Well, sir. Tell us the point. Of making a statue of yourself and your family? History will remember.. Nathuram's sacrifices for his state. Can you make a sacrifice? - Of course. I can do anything for the country. Great. By the way, where's your cameraman? He's shooting from afar. Wait. - Why? Yes. - Bring him back. The tree's blocking my view. Sir, we'll head back. - Back? Why back? You see... we passed your sacrificial ground. What the" Do one thing... take him a little further back. I'll shoot him from a distance of 100 metres. What's going on...! - I want to break Sumer Yadav's record. Raja, we can break records later. Let's just kill him first. We'll get more chances to make a record. - What"! Just shoot him. - This isn't a bad opportunity either. Raja, what are you doing? Just measure the distance! - What's going on! What are you doing, Raja? - This stick must be around one meter. Stay there. - Yadav shot him from 100 metres. It'll take us all day to measure that distance. Shoot him. - No, this'll only take five minutes. Just count. - Raja. They're firing. Don't be too loyal for your own sake. For the sanctity of your soul. - What's this? Holy Water. No need to sacrifice your lives for this useless man. Goodbye. You shot him? Oh no. Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go. We still need to break Sumer Yadav's record. Hail Bajrang Bali. Walk the talk! You two have fantastic coordination. Ra . Who's it now? Hello, sir. Sumer, you're truly good for nothing now. You can pose as Radha forever. You've been replaced. Soon you will hear their names. Let me tell you one thing. You're no longer needed. My job's done. Don't ever take this off. It will protect you. Now you've Rambabu Shukla's permission. To kill Akhand Veer Singh. From today, the entire state of Uttar Pradesh is yours. The barricade's closed. It'll take some time. Stop on the side, under that tree. Increase that volume. Make me a glass of sugarcane juice. Don't forget to squeeze the lime. Do you think we'll be there in half an hour? This isn't right. You've shot an unarmed man. Here, you also shoot me. I am unarmed too. Shoot. Shoot! Rudra, run! Due to the absence of four MLA's from the Parliament. "The Reservation Bill could not be passed.. Madam! We're talking about the Reservation Bill! Move aside! Four MLA's of Ekta Party have been exposed. All four were caught with prostitutes. Raja brother. Raja brother. Please include me in your gang too. You're an artist, stay that way. There's a job. A meeting will be held in two days time. In Sumaria village, next to Sitapur, at 9 pm. Where Akhand Veer's marijuana business. Will be distributed amongst us. Our job is providing security to the entire consortium. You two will go as my representatives. This job is under the supervision of Mr. Bajaj. You... two will stay quiet, behave yourselves. Everyone knows our agenda tonight. Seven months from now.. There will be elections in four states. A year later, there's election in Uttar Pradesh. Correct. I am a businessman, and a stingy one at that. We need a friendly government. Right, Mr. Yadav? This is why, I convinced five of my business friends. And brought them to this meeting. To donate Rupees 100 crores each to the party fund. But, this isn't enough. We need more money. And this shortage will be covered by.. Akhand Veer's marijuana business. "Which will be under my control from today. And for that I'll need protection. "Which will be provided by Rambabu Shukla. You all know Mr. Saxena. The government will support us too. And in return, we'll donate 20% to the Police fund. Mr. Saxena! So, the opposition. - Mr. Saxena! Hey, sir! Weren't you the Inspector General in Agra? My good name is Raja Mishra. He's Rudra Tripathi. - Hello. If we lose this elections. - Did you recognize him? Wasn't he caught in that Agra girl's hostel scam? Yes, he was! You look healthier than before, sir. You're healthier, aren't you? By the way, what are you doing here? We're in-charge of the security here. What can the police do here? Hello! Bajaj sir. [Bali] sir! You haven't even introduced us to anyone here. You two... You two are here only to show your faces silently, not to give advice. Bajaj sir, we were just. - What? Are we cracking jokes here? If you want to crack jokes, then do it someplace else. Stupid monkeys. He called us monkeys. I feel insulted too. - it's been a long time since I felt like this. This scoundrel Bajaj.. - Go on. No, you go first. But, I already know what you were going to say. What? Exactly what I was going to say. Take the car to the airport and pick up my wife. No, I don't need anyone. You can all go. Hello. Yes. Speaking. Fine. Where is she? - In the room. And the room booked under? - My name. I can never make a mistake regarding that. Good. Sir, here's her medical report. It's absolutely clear. Sit. Nice. Why do you look so worried? I put my faith in you and called you here. And when I saw your photograph, I knew.. That, you're not just beautiful, but also smart. Emotional as well. Aren't you? Yes, sir. - Come closer. Sir, there's not much I can do. I can just kiss your cheeks. Will that do? Okay. Close your eyes. Okay.- Come on. Who is it? - Room service. I ordered for it. Papaya. - I see. We'll make a huge film with you. Big one. You two? How dare you.. Sir, who are they? Who are you? I don't know him. I just came here to ask for work. Please let me go. You chose the wrong time to be here. You can't leave now. Come on, Bajaj. Get up. You two are venting out your frustrations about the other night? Have you two lost your mind? Who do you think you are? You don't boss us around anymore. So listen carefully, Bajaj. Don't do anything to humiliate us. Right now we're only kidnapping you. But if you provoke us.. We'll first beat you to a pulp. Then kill you. A hungry Brahmin... is gentle. A rogue Brahmin... is a devil unleashed. Hello, Mr. Bajaj. How are you? Hello. Hello. - Walk faster. Come on. Please walk faster. Come. Come. Come. - Don't misbehave. Sit. Please let me go! I promise I won't tell anyone. We'll decide what to do with you after this operation's over. Sit comfortably. Don't misunderstand us. We respect women. Do you two know what will happen next? This operation is personal. No one else is involved. So, there's no room for compromise. Get it. Make the call. Don't you play cricket. - He sponsors the cricket team. He just plays all games with his mouth. How did you get mixed up with him? Useless. Listen, Dibakar. The Treasury House ruins. Behind the Residency, Museum House.. Just listen what I am saying! Put Rupees 50 million in a bag.. And leave it there in two hours time. I want to donate it to someone. Disconnect the line. Your silence... could've cost you your life. We're going to collect the money. No, no. I'll go. - Why are you always competing? Fine, you go. Go on. Yes, I will. Don't hit on the girl. Are you accusing me? - Let go. Are you accusing me? - Rudra! Hey Shaukat. - Yes, sir. Get the fertilizer from the plant nursery. And get some new rose plants. Hey, we're in Kaiser Baug. That's the Police Inspector General's bungalow. What do we do? It's a bad habit of ours. We like to sin standing by the gates of Hell. Hello. Madam. Are you enjoying this? Sorry, I didn't mean to make it louder. You women watch a lot of TV serials. They are all the same. What do you watch? - Me? We watch the news. The Animal Channel. National Geographic. All news channels are same. Animals are not the same. Did you know that a crow never deceives his mate? They have the same partner all their life. I mean... even crows are better than the likes of him. I'm telling the truth.. Take the other car. Are you Bengali? - Yes. I love Bengali sweets? - Really. I can make them. Really? - Yes. That one... What's it called? - Rosogulla? No. They're smaller? - 'Sandesh'. 'Cham-cham, Malai cham-cham', 'Lady Ginni' Misti Doi. Wow. And you too. - What? Stop. That's the car. Did you see anyone get down from this car? - No. Ruby Tailors, Rai Bareili. It's the Rai Bareili gang. Let's go to Rai Bareili. Wrong. It all seems wrong. The yellow leaves falling in autumn. The blossoming of flowers in monsoon. The white drops falling from the black clouds. Without you, even the moonlight scorches my body. And the light. Hold on.. I'm really sorry. This is the first time this has happened. You made me very emotional. What are you both doing here? - Nothing, just some nonsense. The man you spoke to, Bajaj.. Was very smart. Is it all here? - Yes. He guessed something fishy from your silence. And his men were there. Then? - Then what? I played them. Thank God you didn't come along? - Why? Otherwise you would've just shot them. And complicated the matter. - Right. Thank God I didn't go. Come here. Did you "fire" yet? - Yes, but I missed the target. How do you know? Because, my "bullets" don't kill.. "They awaken the animal inside others. Fine. Come on. Heera, take the bag and leave. I'm leaving you two here.. - Leaving us? Why are you leaving us? I paid you. Lower your voice. - I paid you.. Quiet. You can leave after an hour. My man's watching the door. If you leave earlier than one hour... he'll kill you. Shall we go? - Hold on. Lover-boy. Go home. Your mobile's with me. Buy a new one. Goodbye. Listen. - Yes. Can I come with you two? I don't know anyone here. - You can't stay with us. She didn't ask if she could stay with us. And what if I do? His bullet's hit the target. There's always danger in staying with us. We're dangerous people. - That's okay. It'll be fun. You can be a threat to us. We cannot trust you. If I, as a girl, can trust you, then why can't you trust me? You two are such cowards. We're being decent and you're taking offense. - Rudra. Let's take her along. And if she bungles up I'll be the first to shoot her.. Get lost. Hello. - Hello. All okay? - Yes, go on. So, this is our house. Go, get some rest. You must be tired. No girl's ever entered in here. I mean... before we did everything in that department outside the house. Meaning? Hello. I'm going to get some sleep. I guess you will take care of her sleeping arrangements. No, no it's not like that... she'll sleep down here. I don't care. I'll stay up there.. I wasn't chosen for such a big mission for no reason. You didn't use your brains. You can't even handle the security of the bungalow. Did you realize how we came in? Listen. I let you in because you're still a friend. Otherwise, there would've been a loud bang. And your body would be.. Lying on the grass somewhere. What are you doing? Knead the dough properly. - Yes. Pass me a 'Puri'. - It's tasty. Puri's are called Lucchi's in Bengali. And, we temper the vegetables with 5 spices. That's why it tastes different. This doesn't taste like regular curry. It's got a special touch. Let's change our profession. Open up a Bengali confectionery. What do you say? Get up. You can't stay here. - What did I do? You didn't do anything. You just can't stay here, that's it. Come on. - What're you doing? Let go. What're you doing, Raja? Why do you always misbehave? - What are you doing? You don't like her. So, she won't stay here. Sorry, okay. - No, no, it's completely my fault. I shouldn't have brought her here. Why? She's nice. She likes you too. But, you don't like her. Stan the car. Come on. - Hey... Hello... Listen. You just fell head over heels for her. I thought you'd find a girl, introduce me to her.. And I would approve of her for you. But that process didn't happen. So, can't I be a little angry? You sound like a nagging relative. Listen" Where are you going? Listen. No one's going anywhere. Now, I'm going to treat you to the culinary delicacies. Of Uttar Pradesh. I don't want it. I thought you two would make good friends. We are all good friends. Raja, apologize. And listen... be decent. I... lam.. I love you! This is my apology and my promise. Of love. It's Rambabu. What am I hearing? You two kidnapped Bajaj. Didn't anyone tell you how rudely he behaved with us? Fine, what's done is done. He wanted security for his business, right? Consider it a demonstration of our capability. Remember one thing. You never harm a milch cow. Just scare her. Get that? She's refusing. He's said we need to lay low for a while. Leave town. Where can we go? Delhi? - Almost everyone knows us in Delhi. We can't sit holed up in a room. How about Mumbai? - Yes. Mumbai's okay. No one knows us there. I'll show you two around Mumbai. Just him. I'll take you.. I love you too. First time flying. Small kids are traveling along too. This is an experience. - You call this an experience? Are you more experienced than I am? - Fine. If anything happens. Sir, that's the adjoining room, like you requested. - Yes. And that's the bedroom. I'll take a look. Come in, buddy. I hope you booked me a different room. That's the first thing I did. Yes, that's more like it. Have a nice day, sir. How about we get some food. - Get some food? How about I buy the entire place for you? Nonsense. Anything else, sir? - No. Where do you hail from? - Mumbai, sir. Vinod Mohite. Maharashtra. Have you heard about Rani Laxmibai? - What, sir? The Queen of Jhansi. - What, sir? She was a Maharashtrian as well. I didn't know, sir. - Yes. She was born in Benaras. Benaras? UP? I didn't know, sir. A lot of Maharashtrians. Have been living in Benaras for the last 300-400 years. And we all live together like a family. Keep this. - No, sir. Take it. - No, sir. Thank you. Yes, sir. - We want to meet, Mr. Mishra. Raja. Will you keep playing with guns all day or can we go out? What's so great about this city? - Yeah. It's our first time here, but it seems like we've seen it all. Look! They're shooting a film there! - Where? Which one? - Where? Where? There! Yes. Emraan! - Emraan! Emraan Hashmi. - Emraan Hashmi. Emraan. Goodnight. Goodnight. Now, get lost. - Fine. Goodnight. Goodnight. Are you going to sleep here? What will she think? I have a problem. Problem? What's the problem? Look, when I.. Got it. Go on. I always take a different girl's name. Few times... we were at the verge of.. Then? But the girl got up in a rage and left. I've no regrets about those who left. But if she leaves, I'll be really upset. It's all because you close your eyes. Do it with your eyes open. And.. - Look at her. You won't get distracted. What are you saying? Now go. And listen. - Yes. Keep your eyes open. - Yes sir. Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna! - Brother Sumer. Hare Krishna! - Someone's here to see you. Hare Krishna! Fantastic. The feelings fantastic" when I devout my entire day to God. I don't see the negativity in this world. It took me time to recognize you. All okay? I am just like I've always been. I'm still a man. But sometimes you do get distracted from God. And when you do, you feel like killing someone. Raja and Rudra have been distracting you a lot these days. You got me. You got me. Bajaj got me. Very good. Now, what do you expect to do with me? Rape me? Look, you came looking for me because you need me. Sumer Yadav, you're an exhausted gun. No one needs you. Raja and Rudra will kill you someday. And I will decide what day that will be. I'm a shrewd businessman. I know how to utilize a torn note. Do you have any virility left in you.. Or is it all gone? Try me, I'm still the man I used to be. What's the job? - Gather around your men.. And bid goodbye to the Lord. All I need is your support Then, watch how I explode. Hello. Hello. Hello. - Hello. How are you, Mr. Engineer? - All good. Why don't you ask Mr. Shukla to get his son-in-law promoted. It's due for two years. Change your name and you'll be promoted. What is everyone doing here away from the house? Brother Rudra said.. Yes. - Why did you send all the boys here? Divya's getting engaged. You had to invite everyone. It's a happy occasion, that doesn't come too often. I'm leaving now with Mitali as well. Mitali. Let's go. Sudarshan, get the car.. No, no... don't make that mistake. No, no, no. Small things can do impossible feats. And Marwaris can go a step beyond. Looking very handsome. And let me.. - Mister. How about we talk in Hindi. I'm still a little patriotic at heart. Do you know him? Where's the girl? - What girl? The one you snatched from me. These days she's been flying around like a buttery with you two. Find her. Find my star. Son, come join us for food. - Coming. You've a huge collection of books. What's this? Keep it back, it's not for you. I can see that. I only read religious texts. 'Saaya Mein Dhoop.' What does it mean? There's no girl here, but we found this mobile. She's here. She's right here. Find her. Find her. - Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. You want the money, don't you? I'll give you the money, but let Mitali go. I will certainly take my money. But today I've come here only for pleasure. First I'll taste that Bengali sweet. And then... send you away. After that, your partner. A rogue Brahmin... is a devil unleashed. Deal with him. Mister, just get it over with.. Forgive me, Bajaj sir. It was all that Raja's plan. I really respect you. As much as I respect Bhagat Singh.. Let me show you. Watch. Watch, sir.. Rascal. Son. Food. Please come. Yes. - Raja's just left. Sumer. Stop. Raja's coming. - Let's take care of both today. You can't even handle one. If he arrives, these two will spell trouble for us. He's alone, we'll kill him. - He can take you on alone. Get in.. You don't understand. - You will end up dead yourself. Listen to me. - Let's go. Let's go. Stop the car. Stop. - What's wrong? Hurry up. - Come on, Sumer. Hurry UP- Why you.. - You want to shoot me. Shoot me. Shoot me. Listen. I...dare to barge into the house and kill my target. Hurry UP- Then kill me. Hurry UP- Kill me. I'll call Raja! - No. There comes my friend. - Raja. Who was it? - It was Bajaj, there was another man with him. Whose voice I couldn't recognise. - They fled. Heera! How was Divya's engagement? - Forget that. Heera! Call the ambulance! I'm leaving you, buddy. It was the best time of my life with you. - What? How can you leave me? No! Long live Rudra. Long live Rudra. L, Raja Mishra, son of Ramsharan Mishra.. Caste Shandilya, district Azamgarh.. Swear to avenge your death, before sunset tomorrow. Otherwise, I'll burn myself alive. Get yourself arrested for minor felonies. Stay behind bars. The situation isn't safe outside. What about you? I'll take care of this situation. We won't let you go alone.. - I must! What have you decided? To take care of Bajaj, what else? Your anger is justified. But, not yet. Then, when? This is personal. There's no politics in this. There was another man who helped Bajaj kill Rudra. I am looking for him too. Going against Bajaj means going against the entire system. The system, or you? I've always supported you. So ask the system to be careful. Because I've lost my mind. And I will strangle the whole system. I'm not going to listen to anyone. This is going to be big. Now it is Raja's turn. - Move the car. I'll take care of him for good. What's going on, Shamsher? Hey idiots, get out. Who is it? - How are you, Bajaj? Brother, spare me some alms. - Get lost. Have you lost your mind? Stop, Raja. Stop. Look. No, Raja. Look, Raja. Everyone has seen you. You cannot escape. - I don't want to escape. Raja. Look, Raja. You cannot escape. Look, Raja. No, Raja. Brother! Here you go. Hey... look. No. No. The gun should disappear. - It'll be done. You made a big mistake by killing the artist inside you. Keep in touch. - Yes. The businessman Jatin Bajaj, who was also called the 'Kuber'.. Was murdered in broad daylight at Hazrathganj Square. This incident has sent waves through the political world. Even after the continuous investigations by the police.. "The people of Lucknow refuse to speak about this murder. Mitali, I told you. Go back to Kolkata, back home. If I had wanted to leave, I would have done it a long time ago. What's this? This is mine. From today. - Have you lost your mind? If anything could measure our anger.. "Then we would be at the same temperature. Don't distance me from yourself. I cannot replace our friend Rudra. But I will do anything for you, at any time you want. I'm here to talk to you, not arrest you. You killed Bajaj. In public. People are so scared of you.. That no one's ready to testify against you They aren't scared. They respect me. Whatever it is. I want you to lay low for a while. Lay low? You mean run away. If you lay low everyone will think you've calmed down. Otherwise, Bajaj has many well-wishers. And they are all furious for revenge. Are you threatening me? Because let me make it clear, Inspector General sir. Threats don't scare me. And I'm a Brahmin. I was born intelligent. Tell Bajaj's well-wishers to stay in mourning for him. And not to get too furious. Otherwise, all their families will be mourning for them. If you leave, it will save the reputation of the police. I am not going anywhere! If you value your reputation, then arrest me. Otherwise, employ a sharp-shooter. That has the guts to aim at me. Fine. Rambabuji sent me to talk to you. I'll tell him that you've lost your mind. Tell him... l lost my brother. And our tradition is 'an eye for an eye'. We don't follow corporate culture. And cover up our losses in the next deal. The one who makes a mistake has to pay. And I won't spare him till the next deal. That's my culture. He isn't listening to me.- You try explaining to him. Mr. Tripathi, let me talk to him. - Let's go. Bless you. We're here to tell you that. We won't live for too long. If anything happens to you.. Son. No one dares to face us because they're scared of you. But everyone's looking for a.. What if something happens to you? You two have made a lot of enemies. They won't leave us alone. If you want to see us alive, then leave town for some time. Look, uncle.. - Look, son. Think about Rudra's family. Now, they are your responsibility. Come with me to Kolkata. Sister. She went to Mumbai to become a heroine. Go. - Go. We want to go this way. Fine, go. - Go. No, it's not possible. Acting is fine. We encourage talent like any other Bengali family. But marrying outside the community... Impossible! Pardon me.. - Mom. It's okay. What do you do? - I work in a bank. Assistant Manager. And salary? - A lot. You want to know his salary? Bad manners! You brought a stranger to this house without informing us. Isn't that bad manners? Uncle, why don't you say something? Aren't you a communist? That's surprising. What has being a communist got to do with it? A communist is a communist. Family's family. He'll be our son-in-law. I can tell from the face. So what if he isn't Bengali. - Greetings. My granddaughter will marry only him. Mother, what are you doing? He's my son-in-law. So handsome. I respect him too. That's why I am quiet. Everyone please request Rambabu.. To stop supporting Raja Mishra! Bajaj's death has sent waves through the business community. Look, Bajaj supported us and you too. Now that he's dead, how am I.. Going to contest in the elections, and how are you? Raja doesn't just have my support alone. All the Brahmins and Muslims.. Of the state support him too. Youngsters idolize him as their hero. Look.. - Some decisions should be taken. Beyond loss and gain, Balram Yadav. Fine. Fine. You're taking me lightly.. So you can talk to Srivastav. Only he knows where Bajaj's money is. Talk to him. Stan the connection, son. Open it. Hello, Srivastav sir. This will be our last conversation. If you don't do something about Raja Mishra! No one will get a penny for the election. "And, you can decide the outcome with a wrestling match. And look, don't try to use force on me. Because, I know the secrets of every VIP in this country. And the day I expose them. President's Emergency Rule will be applied in the country. I've no news about Raja. As soon as I find out I'll send him to you. He'll apologise to you. Apologise? This isn't a childish mistake, Rambabuji. Kuber's been murdered. Do you understand the meaning of 'Kuber'? 'The God of wealth'. Bajaj. You need to decide how to deal with Raja. I'll read the news in the papers and release your election funds. Goodnight. At this age, I cannot change profession. Better do the right thing. Come on, get the car. Inspector General sir. - Yes. Why don't you join politics after retirement? Take advantage of.. Finishing off an outlaw gangster like Raja Mishra Look, all our betterment lies in it. Find a fearless man.. Who can silence Raja quietly. Come on. Come on down. When are you bringing sister-in-law home? I'm going to my in-laws next week. I'll see how she's feeling. In two months, I'll be transferred from ltawa. I'll be going to London on deputation. Give me some good news before I go, Darshan Singh. - Yes. How much further do we have to go? Hail Bhawani! Hail Bhawani! Now you know the hardships we have to face. You had to face a little of it too. Did you feel it? - Yes, I did. What are your conditions for surrendering? Firstly, you disrespect me.. And on top of that are trying to boss me around? I hope you know you're in Chambal territory. Police officers go missing here often. You're upset. So, what are your conditions? First, my entire gang will stay in the jail together. Okay. And second, our children back home.. Should get free education. Anything else? And one day before we surrender.. Bipasha Basu will perform here for us. Right? That will be fantastic, chief. - Bipasha Basu? We're making a big sacrifice. Can't we have some fun? Sir, the government will accept all your conditions. "But if Bipasha doesn't agree, we cannot force her. Try. Don't try to be a spoil-span. We'll try, sir. Call us back after two days. Let's go, Darshan. - Hey. He can't leave. He'll stay here. And, Bipasha's going to dance here. If that doesn't happen.. "Then a week later you can prepare for his funeral. No, no, sir... I cannot stay here. Blindfold him. Where are you going, sir? I'll be back. - Sir, please don't leave me. Sir, please don't leave me here. - Hey. Stop. Sir.. - Stop. Stay with us. Sir, I cannot stay here. My wife's in labor. I cannot stay here. You aren't delivering the child. Don't worry. We won't kill you before a week. Can I take a leak? You can consider one of them as Bipasha.. And have some fun in jail. Let's go. Come on, enough singing. You're an insult to renegades. The real renegades used to be back in the old days. Madho Singh. Malkhan Singh. - Paan Singh. I've a question for Arun Singh sir. Single-handed.. - Come, Darshan. Come on. So, Mr. Arun. You single-handedly and in one day.. How did you eliminate such a dangerous gang? Because I fight with emotions, not strength. Take America for instance. They're so strong. But did they ever win? Because, on the other side is emotions. That's fine, Arun Singh sir, but. Please handle them. - Okay, okay. Were you present there? - Yes, I was present there myself. Yes, sir. - We need you in Lucknow. It's important. I'll be there tomorrow. Not just for a day or two. We'll have to get you transferred here. I've already passed the orders. If you've already passed the orders then I'll be there soon. Good news, sir. In two months, I'm going to London on deputation. Sir, just two minutes. - I'm sure.. You will finish this job before that. Sir, we're losing time. We need to file a report. Just give me a minute, sir. Sir, what's your message for the youth? Look, you're awakening my emotions now. If I slap you, you'll be the front news for the rest of your life. Do you want a message for the youth? Do you want a message for the youth? Sorry. - Get lost. A demon warrior is afoot here.. That only a brave warrior like you can kill. Who? Raja Mishra. Then, I better pay my family a visit? Family? - Yes. Allahabad. Why? You see, when it becomes necessary to commit a sin.. "Then one should ask for forgiveness first. He's really smart. He's got your mom on his side. He's really sly. - Enough, dad. Don't utter any more nonsense about Raja? Boys look better if they're bad boys. It's better for this era. Take a look at yourself. So, I'm unfit for this world because I am an honest man! I can't understand what you're saying. Nonsense. I guess you couldn't figure me out yet. Whether I am good or bad. My Mitali's fate would not be that unfortunate. I don't know. You borrowed money from us. And promised to return it in 15 days. - Slowly. Slowly, brother. - But it's been more than 20 days. And I haven't received a single penny. Don't just stand here. Arrange for the money. If we don't get the money today. We'll take your wife's jewellery. He?'- Listen. Here. Pay him. Pay him. Why do you interfere? You can see I was talking to him? The daughter's back home. He must be her guest. What did you say? What did you just say? What did you just say about my daughter? I said your daughter's really beautiful. She's back home. Now, you don't need to borrow any more money. Hey... Go on, who threw the first punch. He did, sir. Sir, he did. Hey... boy! How are you two related? What did you say? - You aren't Bengali? No. I am not a Bengali. But, you police are all the same in the entire country. Ask him to step out with me. Sir. He's trying to bribe you. Bribe. Bribe won't work. Bribe won't work. Sir. Please listen to me. This is Bengal. No corruption. India is a country of migrants. The Opposition that rant about Hinduism. Greetings. - Where are you? Ask someone to call Bada Bazaar police station, Kolkata. Kolkata? - They arrested me for no reason. When are you coming back? - Soon. Still.. - When I come back, the temperature will rise. Everyone will get to know. Hello, sir. Okay, sir. Okay. Let's go. - I see. Hold on. Hold on. Why didn't you tell me who you work for earlier? - It's okay. How about a cold drink? - No. Fine. How about some tea or coffee? - No, thank you. You will have to drink some mineral water, I insist. No, it's okay. Pachori. Call Balwan. Yadav. Raja is in Kolkata, but he can return at any time. Very good. Inspector General sir. - Yes, sir. Be alert. Raja can come back any time. - Yes. Glory to.. - Sumer Yadav! Sumer Yadav! - Stop! Stop. Glory to.. - Greetings to all of you. Before you star-t asking questions. I would like to say, I'm surrendering myself. Because, my life's in danger. There are witnesses against you.. In the CMO murder case. You shouldn't say such things. About great personalities, son. He's here to create history. He's surrendering himself, didn't you hear? Bring him here. The court's right here. Bring him in front of me.. - Raja! Who's stopping you? That's the voice I heard that day. Raja! This is the man that was with Bajaj that day. I am not crazy. I am a religious man, I read religious texts. - Sumer Yadav! He must have fired the shot that killed Rudra. Bajaj just gave the orders. 'I am going back, Mitali.' 'This happiness is futile, because.' '..the murderer of my friend is..' '..is still hiding somewhere and smiling.' 'But I promise... l will meet Sumer Yadav just once.' 'And we'll meet again soon.' 'Wait for me.' Yes, is everything okay? I'm in Lucknow. Where are you going to stay? Hello. - Hello. Shall we go home? - Not home. It's dangerous. As long as we don't kill Sumer Yadav. I don't want to get entangled in any petty trouble. It's not strong. It will blow-up in a single shot. Hello. Hello, brother. This is your home. You can stay here as long as you like. Downstairs is my family and up here, is your abode. You won't face any problem. Do you visit the temple? - Every Tuesday. As long as I'm here, every day's a Tuesday. From home to temple, and back. No other work will happen.. - Yes. Listen. I don't want to get caught for anything foolish you do. Understand? - Yes. I'm planning an operation. And I will leave as soon as it's done. I'll never forget this favor. If the youth of Uttar Pradesh protest against Raja's death.. "Then it will be your job to contain them. In return, I'll nominate. Six of my weakest politicians to stand against you. After Raja's death, the people of Uttar Pradesh won't listen to me. Listen to me.. Politics and prostitution are really old professions. And both include maintaining peace, carefully. The shooter you're calling to kill Raja.. Will also have to sacrifice his life later. Is that Raja's file or erotic stories that you're reading? Raja and Rudra's stories should be published, sir. They have such a colourful past. But, one thing is clear. They couldn't have done all this without. The support of someone powerful. Who's supporting Raja? Rambabu Shukla. He's a senior Minister. Sir, if you want Raja to be arrested or finished.. Then understand that from now on I am the senior most here. I don't care what you've decided.. "But I'll release the election funds.. Only after Raja's dead. Raja's not the only one who will die.. Many others will lose their lives. I don't care. One of them will be your men. - Who? Sumer Yadav. He's in your jail. Raja will come out of hiding when he's out in the open. You couldn't control yourself either. You're here to see the match too. I am not here to see the match. I am not interested. I am here to warn you. - Why? What's wrong? Raja is in Lucknow. What? I heard that you're the only thing on his mind. So, what can he do? I am in jail. He's been in this jail for a long time. We don't know who's working for him. Catch him. Catch him. - Catch him. Hold his leg. Catch him. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. What the" Who was it? Who was it? Who was it? Who tried to kill me? Who was it? Greetings. - Bless you. There's toothpaste. Oil. And four packets of biscuit. That's what your family sent for you. Stop. Stop. Stop. Get lost. Who sent you in jail? - What are you doing, Sumer? He's under trial. - Who sent you? He's been sent to jail today. How can he be your enemy? He was staring at me. You're the superstar of this jail. He must be a fan following you around. Right, I am being followed around a lot. I won't spare anyone. Get back to work. People are questioning your courage. They think you're scared. Sir... - Media. People vote only for those who are media-friendly. Go out of the jail. Once you do, Raja will come after you. You can finish him off with Munna's help. Is this why you called me here? You cannot kill Raja alone. For that, you need a intelligent.. And strong ally like Sumer Yadav. Get that. I've arranged for your bail. Sumer Yadav. Brother Sumer, greetings. - Bless you. Sumer Yadav. Isn't your life in danger now? I am fearless now. Now, I'm connected with the Lord. Glory to.. Hold on, sir. - Get that. Sir, have you been given bail or acquitted. Of such grave crimes. You will have to tell us. You will have to tell the media, sir. You just saw Sumer Yadav has been granted bail.. And he has left. Let's go. How are you? - Even/thing's fine. All okay. - Greetings, chief. Welcome everyone to the cycle competition. This year Suresh from our neighborhood.. Make a 'Paan' for me. What are you making? - Here. You imbecile. Make it very spicy. Beautiful. Its too sharp. Want one? Have it. Sumer's really smart. He finishes a job and hides in the temple. I've been following him for three days. He goes at least twice. Sometimes by day, sometimes at night. Night's best, brother. - No. We'll kill him during day. It's very crowded during the day. I will let everyone know.. That I avenged Rudra's death. So what if it's crowded. That's where I'm going to kill him. It's the tradition of Raghu clan. Lay down your life, but never break a vow. See.. I'll slap you. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Greetings! .. - Greetings! .. Stop. Stop. I'll slap you. Move. I had to kill Rudra. You know this happens in our profession.. Just forgive me. I swear, I will never forget this favor. I want to kill you every day, Sumer Yadav. Three times a day. Arrange for something like that. And I'll be indebted to you forever. Are you completely dead? Who are you? You're way too excited on this matter. How much did Sumer Yadav pay you? I'm still on the government pay list. The name's Arun Singh Munna. Chambal's watch guard. - So, you recognized me. Look. I did what I had to. You can shoot me now if you like. I won't kill you. You're a fantastic guy. Look. Either you let me go, or fight me. Look, there he is. Rambabuji, except for the Prime Minister and President. "Ministers like us, are not too secure as we grow old. Neither the family nor the Party supports us. The only thing that supports us is money! Now all the industrialists will run away. Raja Mishra is.. - What can I do?! Sir.. I... Your aim was bad. - Sir, I tried" That's why he escaped. He has become even more popular after killing Sumer Yadav. Just once, tell me.. - I don't know where Raja is. Rambabuji, please. Just find out once... where Raja is. Did you call them? No, sir. I didn't. - Stop. Excuse me. - You fool. They are from the press. Let them through. How are you? - It's your grace. It's okay, son. - Hello, brother. Raja wants to talk to you. Here. Hello. - Greetings sir. Where are you? - Do you want to know that. Or tell the world about it? - Meaning? I mean, only you knew that I was back in the city. So how did Sumer Yadav get police protection? And from that was Chambal watch guard, Arun Singh. Anyway, I took my revenge. And the police couldn't do anything about it. I just called to tell you that I am leaving. To star-t a new life. New address... new name, new profession. And if I find out, that you were responsible. For sending that police officer after me.. "Then I'll come back in this form. And spread havoc! And I won't spare you either. I never saw you in Raja's gang before. He met me a little later. By the way, these days he trusts me the most. You're being loyal to someone.. Who doesn't have too long to live. Meaning? I mean... this is the reward for being loyal.. To the Lord's devotion and politics. Come here. - Yes. Are you coming? - Yes. Look after yourself. Here's your passport Okay. Please see if it is right or wrong I don't always know what's right or wrong. But whatever's happening now is right. All of you head back to your villages. Thank you for your support - Brother. And you, Mr. Artist. You won my heart. - Don't embarrass me. Your gun? - I don't need it anymore. Why is he coming this way? No one can narrate your story better than me, Raja. Come on, get out of here. The investigation is going on.. And the police have been posted here since morning. These images are of a Lucknow highway.. Where gangster Raja Mishra is believed.. To have died in a car bomb. If Raja Mishra's death... Where are you? At the airport? Yes, sir. I'm heading to Delhi. Call me when you come back from Delhi. I'll receive you personally. What's the occasion, sir? The government has allotted you a piece of land. Sir, you're too kind.. I'll take you to see the land myself. Okay, sir, definitely. Yes, sir. In two days time, I will take Munna to show him the land. He's a smart officer. We'll need to be careful. Make arrangements for yourself. Thank you. Good afternoon, Ma'am. 'Mr. Artist. You won my heart.' 'You're embarrassing me.' 'Your gun? - I don't need it anymore. ' 'So... Rambabu took you under his wing too.' 'And what did he ask in return?' 'Mr. Artist, Raja can forgive most mistakes, but not betrayal.' 'This is the reward for being loyal.. To devotion and politics.' 'From today, you're responsible.' '..for the security of this country.' 'When you leave for the airport.' '..Arun Singh will kill you on the way.' 'And then... l will kill Arun Singh.' 'That's the plan.' My younger brother, Param. - Hello, sister-in-law. The gun that he keeps waving around.. 'The government you're risking your life for..' '..is humiliating your integrity.' 'You will kill me, and the public will get enraged.' 'And to calm them down, your life will be sacrificed.' 'My job was to finish Raja.' 'And Raja will be finished.' 'It's not safe for you here.' 'Come with us to Malaysia.' 'Brother, you spared me.' 'Brother, I will never forget you..' 'It's not me, the Lord's doing it all.' 'Why is he coming this way?' This air travel is always the most challenging for me! Why are you holding my hand? Sir, please be seated. Don't move, sir. Please. - I'm scared, need a window seat. Now you make my fears go away.
