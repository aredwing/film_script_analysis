That, uh, that show that you like is on tonight, isn't it? Um... Hey! Hey, cutie. What's the name of it? Um... Aw, come on, Linda. You're making me feel very guilty here. Look, it's just gonna be for a couple of hours. I deserve this. I haven't been out of the house for over three months. Three months. Gee, that's probably exactly how long it's been... since I've been out. [Dog Barking] Looks like Mike almost has his date for tonight. 'Cause I'm so studly. Yeah. Yeah? Linda. [Chuckling] Nobody is taking dates. It's a bunch of guys going to a boxing match. That's it. What? Wh... Why are you lookin' at me like that? 'Cause I know your friends. They have the hormones of high school kids. Don't start accusin' me of runnin' around. You're the only one who has a family. It's time you start hangin' out with grown-ups. My friends are grown-ups. Oh. Sorry. [Man On P.A. System] If you look out of the starboard side... - What the hell is that? - The aging but potentially dangerous... Mr. Frank Wyatt! Not since the turn of the century has he come and vacationed with us. Let's dust him off and give him a big round of applause. Oh! - Here's one of your grown-up friends now. - I gotta go. Go. Go and have some fun. [Man On P.A. System Continues, Indistinct] Maybe you'll stop walkin' around with that look on your face. ... schmoozing it up with one of the great-great-grandchildren... of the original Chippendale's dancing squad! Say good-bye. I have no regrets, okay? Whatever you say. ## [Horn] Bye, gorgeous. Daddy's gotta go. [Baby Gurgling] I love you. [Man On P.A. System] Uh, excuse me. I love you too. We've got some family values exhibitions here. I'll be home early, okay? That's actually his baby. Yeah, Linda. Say, around, uh, 8:00 a.m. - Let's dust off the toddler and take him with us. - Oh. Thanks. I'm on the couch tonight for sure. That's simple, Frank; she hates me. She does not hate you. I've been married to that woman for two years. Ah, remember your birthday? ## [Humming] [Laughing] She hates you. [Laughing] Hey! Hey! - Let me get rid of these bums, I'll be back to get on you. - Promise? Check it out inside, man. It's bigger than your house. Whoo! Prepare to have your pleasure glands carpet-bombed. Watch out for the floors, 'cause they're marble. Ohh. You guys. Wow. Whoo! Cool system, man. Thanks. ## [Stereo Blaring] Don't, uh, touch anything, okay? ## [Volume Lowers] That's not right for you. And don't put your dirty dogs on my clean upholstery either. Ray, where the hell did you get this thing? I promoted it. You what? I conned the dealer into letting me take it out for the evening. Well, how did you do that? Well, I was driving past the dealership... and I was thinking about this evening, so I go inside and say... "This baby is perfect for entertaining clients and I was thinking about using it... to buy a few for my sales force," at which time he got on his hands and knees, begging me to take it out. Wait, wait. Your "sales force," Ray? Mm-hmm. I may have some. And I will. [Laughing] Tomorrow I'll return it and say, "Thank you, but under very careful consideration... "I would have to say, it's not big enough. "I need a driver's side air bag in the bathroom. [Laughing] And I'll see ya." Naaah! Ray Cochran, the man, the myth. [Laughing Continues] Yes, indeed. We're running late. Where's Eddie? Eddie canceled at the last minute, so I invited someone else. - Who'd you invite? - [Tires Screeching] - Hey, no! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Hey, hey, hey! [Ray] Who's the crash test dummy? [Tires Screeching] [Frank] Hmph! That's your little brother. [Laughing] Ray, don't start. Linda's been bustin' my balls since I got home, okay? Ray, give him a break, man. John's a good guy, bro. He's a g... He's a pain in the ass! Every time you guys get together, man, it's like a slugfest. [Frank] That's not true. [Ray] It's not true. - So he doesn't piss you off every time you get together. - He's my brother, I invited him. [Man] Hey, Razorman! That's cool. It's nice. What the hell is this thing? Just get in. Looks like Barbie's Playhouse. [Ray] You should know,: You're the one who plays with dolls! Mike, where you been, buddy? Jesus, look at this thing. Yo, bro. My big brother actually invites me to go somewhere, huh? - You sick or somethin', Frank? - You're late, as usual. What do ya say, fight fans? Crack open some libations, let's get on the road. - Beers are in the fridge, John. - Ooh! Beer! #Doo doo doo-doo Doo doo doo-doo # [Ray] Okay, all aboard! [Frank] Ray, that's a conductor, not a bus driver. Sit down and shut up! Now that's a bus driver! Let me see your transfer, miss. [Mike] When has any of you been on a bus? Let me tell you, I've seen a few... [All Laughing] #Doo doo doo-doo Doo doo doo-doo # #Doo doo doo-doo Doo doo doo-doo ## [Ray] Yeah, all right! I got 600 on Davis. Yeah. [Mike] What? You idiot! Davis rhymes with "save us!" [Laughing] [Frank Laughing] You should've given the money to us! [Frank] We're gonna miss the prelim. [Ray] The Razorman will not be letting you down. I don't intend to miss one single, solitary punch. [Ray] Where did this kid come from? Your boy's about to get beat! What's he doing? He needs to bob and weave! Look at that! Thank God this thing has a satellite dish, right? [John] Oh, shit! Much better than sitting ringside, Ray, much better! Another day in front of the boob tube! [Ray] We're gonna be so close, we may get blood on us. [Frank] Coming out of our noses, the seats'll be so high in the rafters! [Mike Laughing] [Ray] Gimme a break! [John] Oh, shit! Yeah, yeah, yeah! [TV Announcer, Indistinct] Look at him go! Yeah! Oh! Oh! Yeah! Hit him! Hit him! [Mike Yelling, Indistinct] [Frank] Yeah! Hit him! - Hell, yeah, look at him go, man! - [Frank] Hit him, hit him! [All Yelling, Indistinct] See his feet? His legs are bucklin'. [Mike] It's over. [Frank] His manager's outside bettin' on the other guy. Hernandez and that Martinez kid won't last three rounds. - We're gonna miss the main event. - We should just settle in and... Bullshit. We're not gonna miss anything. Just shut that TV off. - Hey, Ray, take it easy. - Do you want to make it to the fight on time or not? Hmm? All right. [Announcer] It's a battle between the number two... and number three middleweights in the world. Mickey "Mad Dog" Davis... [Horn Honking] Oh, shit. - [Tires Screeching] - [Mike] Whoa, what are you doin'? He's not gonna let me in. - Hey! How about it, huh? Can we get in? - How about what? - Can we get over? - Why don't you wait your turn like everyone else, asshole? - Forget it. Hey, stop! - You gonna let us over? - [John] No way, man, no way. - Ray, this guy's not stoppin'. Back off already. I'm not gonna back off. What are you doing? [Frank] Hey, back off, man. He's not stoppin'! Look out! - [Crash] - Oh, this guy hit me! He just hit me! - [Indistinct Yelling] - [Ray] I don't believe this guy hit me! Fuck you! What are you doin'? Fuck you! You want some, come on! Fuck you! - [Mike] Ding, ding, ding! Round one! - Kick this motherfucker's ass. Yeah? Let's see something, you little fuckin' weasel! Let's see what you got! Get off me, Frank! Get off me! Not tonight, man. I didn't think so. I can take this motherfucker! [Frank] Don't be a jerk! What? - Fuck you! - Come on, John Boy! I'll beat the shit outta both of you! Hey, buddy, back off. Hey, what's this? What do ya got... Aaah! Aah! Don't! [Cracking] Hey! It hurts, huh? Huh? [Woman] Hey! - Leave him alone. - Yeah, relax... Aaah! Aah! And take the pretty girl home... - unless you want me to, huh? - [Man Grunting] Huh? I can't hear you. I'm sorry. What? [Grunting] Yeah, all right. Come on, buddy. You're not worth it. Nice job, buddy. Shut up, man! [Man] All right, already, let's go! [Man] Way to go, tough guy! I can't believe people in this fuckin' town! Calm down, honey. Married life makin' you soft, Frank? I remember when your brother would've dumped that guy on his ass. Yeah. What's the matter with you? You can't get into it... with every asshole that looks at you funny. There's a lot of craziness goin' on out there. You never know what maniac is gonna blow your goddamn brains out! It happens every day in this city! You listen to me! What, Frank? What are you gonna do? You're not my father, Frank. Way to go, little man. You showed some heart. Hey. What did I say, huh? You remember what I said? I know, I'm sorry. Don't encourage him with that macho shit. I'm sorry, Frank. But he's right, you know. What are you talkin' about? You're not his father, bro. - That was really smart, baby brother. - Enough, Ray. All right? - Stop acting like you're three. - Why do you always have to say shit like that? Hey, let's knock it off! I wanna have a good fuckin' time tonight, all right? Everybody hold on to somethin'. We're gettin' outta here. ##[Rock] What the hell are you doin'? I tell you something; I'm not gonna miss this fight. [Laughing, Indistinct Talking] I hate being late! Wait! A cop! I'm joking! [Laughing] Whoo-hoo! #Here we go again Second shot # #Lookin' for a bang with the nice hips # # Gotta have a set of them pink lips # # When it comes to sex # [Mike] Ray's the man! Do it! [Mike Imitating Barking Seal] ##[Music Continues] Whoo! Come on! Whoo! Yes! Yes! Wha-hoo! [Yelling, Indistinct Talking] [Tires Screech] [Laughing] Whoo! Whooooooo! Oh, my God! [Ray] Give it up! Give it up! [Laughing] I tell you something. Here's to me and those like me... 'cause very few of them remain! [Chuckling] [Frank] Thank God! [Mike] An extraordinary piece of navigation, my brother. Thank you, my brother. [Frank] Do you have any idea how to get there from here? [Ray] We double-back around the expressway. How hard can it be? ## [Imitates Scary Music] I bet there's some tremendous real estate bargains down here. That's great, but where's the damn expressway, huh? Enough of this scenic route. [Ray] The guys that built the expressway did it logically. We hit the next intersection and cut over. [Mike] I don't see any signs or anything, Ray. [Ray] If I can cross over the one-way street we exited off, [John And Frank Muttering] We'll be fine. [John] We've been around this block a thousand times. [Frank] Wait a minute. [Ray] I don't care. We just gotta cross the one-way street. [Indistinct Arguing] [Frank] I know where we are... we're lost! Don't you worry about it. A little faith, my friends. We have never been here. [Mike] Oh, look... The Brothers Johnson. [Laughing] Ray, I'm just bein' logical. When you're lost, you ask for directions. So let's ask those guys. They look like they know their way around. Sure, we'll tell them we're the Welcome Wagon and we have baked goods for them. [On P.A. System] Excuse me, gentlemen. We're the Welcome Wagon. Can you come here for a minute, please? Mr. Welcome would like to ask you something! [Laughing] Give me that! - You know what? That's not funny. - Ooh, here they come, Ray! Ooh, here they come. They're comin' to party! There they go! - How are ya? - Show 'em, man. Show 'em what you got. Check it out. All right. Watch this. - Oh, shit! - [Frank] Ray, what the hell are you doin'? [Man] Let him have it, Earl. [Laughing] - [Laughing] - How is that funny? Tell me, 'cause I don't get it! - [Laughing, Indistinct Talking] - Get us back on the expressway. - Jesus! - [Tires Screeching] [Homeless Men] Good-bye! [Ray] Lock the doors. [Mike] You got the gun. Anybody comes through the door, we blow 'em away. [Ray]Just lock the doors. [Frank] I'll lock the goddamn door. [Ray] I don't even know if I'm insured on this thing. Whoa, wait. What? You really know how to use this thing, Razor? Beretta 9mm. Shit happens, man. [Chuckling] You were right, Frank; you never know what maniac's gonna pull out a gun. About the only maniac I know is you. Hey, you know what we need? We need a friggin' map. Who carries a map? Thousands of unarmed people who drive Hyundais carry maps, Ray. [Frank] Now how about getting us outta here? I think there's a map in the glove compartment, man. Right here? No, the one right to the right of it. Right. Well... Here it is. You're a little closer than I am. - Oh, hey, hey! - [Tires Screeching] [Grunting] Oh, Jesus! Who... What was that? [Mike] I don't know, I think we hit somethin'. Maybe a dog or somethin'. No, we didn't. Ray, I felt it. I think we hit someone. You know where the hell we are? They're scam artists, okay? - They make a living doing this. - Doing what, Ray? Run out into the street, pretend to get hit and blow your head off! Somebody might be hurt, Ray. [Ray] Frank, what are you doin'? I'm gonna check it out. What are you... Frank! You guys doin' the Mother Teresa show? Wh... Hey. Hey! Nothin' down here. [Panting] He's dead. Think again, asshole. Shit! Be careful! Easy, easy, easy. Come on, don't move. [Panting] It's gonna be all right. - What's happening? - We hit somebody! Call 9-1-1! Ohh! Oh, my God. I don't believe it. Aah. [Dialing] [Ringing] [Woman] 9-1-1 emergency. How long did they say it was gonna be? The phone's dead, man. There's no service in this shithole part of town! Okay, we gotta get him to an emergency room. Oh, how do you work this, Ray? I didn't see him, man. He came out of nowhere. I never... It wasn't my fault. Hey! Bring him into the RV! Come on. All right. [Panting] Okay. All right. I got ya. [Bottles Shattering] Is he okay? Hear me out. Let's figure this thing out. Move, Ray! Move! Aah! Easy, easy, easy! Careful, careful! All right, easy, easy, easy. Easy, easy. [Grunting] Aah! Be careful, be careful. [Frank] What the hell happened? Ray, get a towel. [Man Coughing] - Ohh! - [Ray] He's been shot! Put this under his head! Be careful. Easy, easy. Ohh! - Hey, hey, hey, hey! - It's all right. [Coughing Continues] He's a thief, man. The cops probably shot him. They'll be back any minute. - What happened, kid? Who shot you? - Hey, leave him alone. Goddamn it, somebody shot him! We could all be in danger! - We're not gonna leave him. - Look, I've had a lot to drink tonight, okay? Hey, man, what's your problem? The kid is hurt. You want me to go to prison because of this punk? It is not our concern. Yes, it is, Ray. They're coming after me. You gotta help me. We won't let anybody hurt you. - You gotta get me outta here! - Shut up, goddamn it! I can't hear myself think! [John] Ray, you shut up! Who the hell are you tellin' to shut up? No, wait! Listen. [Distant Siren Blaring] [Man] You can't tell them about the money. [John] We'll catch 'em. Everything's gonna be fine. [Man] Look, that's not what I'm worried about, man. - There they go, right there! - [Ray] They didn't see us. We gotta catch 'em! Look, we should get our stories straight. If you're not gonna drive, I will. [Mike] Let's go! Get out of the way! [Tires Screeching] There they go! [On P.A. System] Hey, help, police! Help! We got somebody shot! Hey! [Siren Blaring] They turned the corner! Hey! S- O-S! Hey! We got wounded in here! Frank! Frank, take it easy Shit. Where the hell are they? [Mike Screaming] [Mike] Fuck! Where did they go? - [Tires Screeching] - Whoa! Ohhh! [Mike Coughing] Ohh! Ray, you okay? Ray? Huh? Yeah, I'm all right. You all right, Frank? Yeah, I think so. [Frank] I didn't see 'em. [Indistinct Mumbling] Aah! [Grunting] Ahh! What the hell hit us? My guess? Probably some no-insurance... car-driving asshole bashed into us in a fucking junker! Un-fuckin'-believable! - Ray, calm down. - Calm down? This stuff's gonna cost me a fortune. I'm now the proud owner of a nice little fax machine. Gonna fax myself. Might be nice for me later. Large screen. Huh? Brand-new piece of shit TV. - This'll be mine. All right. Okay. - You okay, brother? Yeah, I'm fine. This stuff's gonna cost me right here. Uh. We're stuck in here. We're stuck, okay? We're stuck in this piece of shit which I now own, okay? This piece of fuckin' shit! Ray, Ray! - Ray! Ray! - Calm down! Hey, Ray, why don't you try and start this thing? Fuck, get a window open or somethin'. [Grunting] Damn thing's stuck. Great. Wonderful. [Engine Cranking] It's dead. We're not goin' anywhere. - They're out there. - Who you talkin' about? Who's out there? You guys don't know what you're messin' with. We gotta get outta here! We gotta get ou... Shut up! We're doing the best we can, all right? All right, quiet! [Wind Whistling] [Slamming] [Man] You hear that? I'm gonna take a look around. No, don't do that. They'll blow your head off. Ray, get the gun. Get the fuckin' gun, Ray. It's gone. What? It fell out when we hit. It's gotta be here. Try and find it. [Mike] Look for it. [Ray] I'm lookin', man. [Mike] You see anything? Nothing. Seems okay. I think we can all squeeze through there... What up, Teddy? Playin' a little hide-and-seek? Come here, motherfucker! Back the fuck off! [Teddy] No! - Ladies. - No! Come on, man! You wanna get tough with me, kid? You wanna keep 'em, huh? Back off, kid. You ain't got no balls. Now, you children sit tight and no one'll get hurt, okay? Crack a window. You okay? [Dialing, Busy Signal] The thing isn't working? I thought you said there was no service. Look... [Grunting] Sykes, look, no. You know... Shh. [Car Approaching] [Tires Screeching] [Teddy] This is crazy. Sykes, you know me. [Sykes] See, Teddy, the problem is, No, there's no problem, man! You broke one of his rules. It's not like that, man. I didn't do anything. All you gotta do is tell Fallon, that's all I'm askin'! - Tell Fallon what? - Well, go ahead, tell him. [Panting] Look, it's not what you think, man. I-I wasn't running, man. You got it wrong. Look. I got all the money right there! You... You can count it. [Sighing] How could you steal from me, Teddy? I-I wasn't stealin' from you. It's right there. All the money, man! Only thing I hate worse than a thief is a liar, Teddy. You broke rule number one: Do not steal from me. [Grunting] What you thinkin' about, Teddy? - Come on, we grew up, man. - All you had to do was keep the merchandise movin', Teddy. What was the problem? No company car? Not long enough lunches? [Fallon Continues, Indistinct] [Frank] We cant just sit here. - We're not gonna do anything! Not one fucking thing! - Shh! Come on! What? What do you want us to do, man? Did you mention my name to the guys in the truck? Did you mention my name? I didn't say anything! Why the fuck would I say anything? I wouldn't rat you out, man! So what do you want me to do? You want me to let you go? - Then I'm supposed to conduct business on the street. - Who's gonna know, right? - He's not gonna tell 'em, I'm not gonna tell 'em. - That's right. - No, man, all you gotta do is... - [Gunshot] [Gunshot Echoing] [Echoing Continues] You know, we got another problem. How many guys in the truck? About four. North Shore plates too. Great. Just great. Well, boys, rule number two: No witnesses. Come on! - [Mike] Fuck! - Come on, John, or you're gonna be next! - [Mike Yelling] - Fuck. [Yelling, Grunting] [Mike] Come on! Come on, Ray! Come on! - What the hell are you doing? - [Mike] Come on! - Aw, shit! - What? - Come on! Fuckin' come on, Ray! - Where do these guys think they're goin'? - [Gunshots] [Gunshots Continue] [Grunting] Come on, Ray! Come on, buddy! Shit! Oh! Sorry, man! That's not exactly what I had in mind. [Frank Chuckling] Thanks. That's what I'll tell the dealer. You won't be telling the dealer nothin' unless we get the fuck outta here! [Fallon] That was great. Do it again. That's not funny. Hey, man, that was funny! Shit looks like the Hindenburg, man. Come on! Let's go! [Panting] Let's go, Ray! [Ray Panting] [Mike Grunting] Stop! Where are we headed? [Everyone Panting] John, are you all right? [Coughing] Why? Why'd they do it? They killed him, Frank. They killed him. I don't think they're gonna follow us, man. They won't do that. We saw him shoot that kid, Ray. We were witnesses. Where the hell are we, huh? [Panting] Why'd you get off the expressway, Ray? Are we at the blaming stage now? I don't remember twisting your arm to get off the expressway. [Tires Screeching] Go! Go! [Grunting, Panting] Hey! [Grunting] Forget it, Mike! Come on! Come on, Mike! [Grunting] Frank! Frank! Ohh! [Panting] Did they see us? I don't know. I don't think so. [Engine Stops] [Ray] Frank was right. - They do want to kill us. - I never said they wanted to kill us! - What are we gonna do? - Shut up! Well! - Look what the cat drug in. - [Mike] Keep your voice down. [Fallon] Hello, ladies! What do you think of the neighborhood? Call these "condos" down here. Nice, huh? Could be just like one of those North Shore suburbs, huh? Guess what? I knew you guys would go straight for the rail yard. But you didn't pass "Go," so you definitely don't get the 200 bucks. You just sit tight, 'cause I'm gonna come door to door... like the goddamn Avon lady. And by the way, you fucked up my car... and I don't have collision. [Man] Guy out there sounds like he wants to do you... bodily harm or somethin'. [Giggling] I'm a college graduate. [Man] That's Buck. He's got the brain of a chicken. [Banging] Sure would be a shame... if he was to hear you in... here, oop! Shh! Shh! Damn shame. [Banging Continues] They'd... They'd shoot us and then blow your heads off. I don't think so. Might even be grateful. Might give us a reward. All right. All right, goddamn it. Name your price. Uh, well, gee, Mr. Businessman, [Men Laughing, Murmuring] What did you have in mind? - [Fallon] Don't move! - [Banging] Don't whisper. Don't even breathe. [Banging] Don't you hate it... when you're tryin' to be quiet... and every sound... seems to be amplified... 20 or 30 times? [Banging] [Fallon] What is that? [Sniffing] What's that smell? You guys wearing cologne, or is that... fear? Nice watch. Go to hell. Already there, man. Ray, give it to him. [Banging] [Moaning] [Scraping, Rattling] [Banging] Lucy, I'm home! You got some 'splaining to do! [Scraping, Rattling, Banging] Don't touch me! Don't be stupid, John. [Murmuring] [Panting] All right. That's all I got. [Sighing] You guys are really startin' to piss me off! This is eatin' into my drinkin' time. But I'll tell you what I'm gonna do; since I'm such a nice person... and so in touch with my inner child... I'm gonna give you a chance to come out, forget about the bullshit... we'll discuss this! I'm gonna count to three! One Mississippi... two Mississippi. All right! Opportunity knocked, and you failed to answer! Don't say I didn't give you a chance! Come on, let's talk! [Banging] Let's mingle! All right! Now I'm gettin' mad! This one's locked up too, man. It's possible they didn't even stop here, they just took right off. It just doesn't feel right, you know? I'm a college graduate. I used to play college ball. Ain't got my jacket no more. That's too bad. Somebody stole it. But, you know, I... I had... I had great hands, man. I mean, you shoulda seen me! "Go up high, Buck!" [Grunting] Buck! Take it easy! Shh! Shh! What are you doin'? I'd go out wide, man! I could've been Walter Payton! Sure you could. This guy played too many games without a helmet. You think I'm funny or somethin', man? Who do you think you are... wearing that jacket and callin' me a liar? Shh! 'Cause I'm a goddamn college graduate! [Indistinct Talking] You think I'm some rummy who never went to college! [Buck Continues, Indistinct] What the hell do I gotta do to shut him up? [Indistinct Talking Continues] Come on, let's get out! Come on, man, move it! Take out time, boys! [Indistinct Talking, Yelling] Let's go! [Shouting Continues] [Grunting] Shit! Hobo from Purdue. I hate Purdue. When's the last time they ever won anything anyways? Hmm, plastic. That's one of 'em. Hmm. Bums must've rolled 'em, huh? Welcome to the neighborhood, boys. [Panting] [Sykes] There they are! Come on! [Grunting] Come on, we can outrun them. [Mike] This way! Come on! Come on, come on, come on! [Panting] [Grunting] Hold it! Shh! [Barking] John! John! Get up! Let's go! [Groaning] Frank, listen, I can't fuckin' keep up, okay? You have to! Don't leave my ass down here. This is hell. You can do this, man. You take care of me, I'll give you anything you want. All I want... is for you to move your ass. We're gonna make it, all of us. Okay. Okay? Now, I think we lost 'em. All right. Hey, you okay? Yeah, I'm all right. Where are the cops? Someone must've heard the blasts. You could dynamite a whole city block, they wouldn't come. It's criminal. Look at this. Oh, yeah. Ohh, reach out and touch someone, my ass, huh? Great. Hey, wait, there's lights on in that building up there. Let's go get some help. Come on. [Panting] Come on! Come on, Ray! [Ripping] [Ray] Damn, I tore my jacket! Come on! I'd be worryin' about my ass, not my jacket! Yeah, well, my ass doesn't cost 450 bucks! ##[Rap, Indistinct] ##[Continues] If anything happens, don't think, just run. Okay? Gotta find someone who'll let us use their phone. You really think one of these freaks is gonna let us use their phone? "These freaks" are our neighbors, Ray. They're not my neighbors, man. Oh, yeah? I bet we haven't been more than ten miles from your front door this whole night. [Creaking] What's up with that noise? [Creaking Continues] - I should go talk to him. - No, no, no. I got a better idea. Mike! [Rattling Door] There's a way in over there. Hi, sir. I need to use your phone. No! No, no! No way! Just one phone call! Thanks a lot! [Man Yelling, Indistinct] Mike, take it easy, man. You too, buddy! Hello, anybody home? [Man] Who the fuck does he think he is? What's wrong with these people? They're just like you. How is that? They're scared. They won't even talk to us. [Knocking] Hi. May we use your phone? Hey, hey! Get behind the door! Nobody's gonna help us. Nobody. Welcome to the real world, Ray. This is it! If you say that to me again, I'm gonna kill you, I swear I will. ##[Rap, Indistinct] [Knocking] Hello. Hello? Anybody in there? Please open the door if you're there. Hello. [Knocking] Come on, please! Wait, wait, wait. Don't wanna scare her off. Excuse me. [Woman] Yeah? What do you want? I need to use a phone. Just hold it right there. Now keep back. Keep back! Please, just listen... 'Cause I'll bust all your goddamned heads, and don't think I won't! Clarissa, you all right? Get out of here, Rita! Just give us a chance... The only chance you're gonna get... is to get your motherfuckin' asses in gear before I start swingin'! - I told you these people didn't want to help us. - Look! We saw a boy murdered tonight. The men that shot him did it in cold blood, and if they catch us... - they're gonna kill us too. - So they're following you? - No, no, we lost them. - [Mike] You gotta believe us. We're telling the truth. We just wanna use your phone to call the police. That's it. We're not gonna cause you any trouble. Please. Sykes, this is bullshit. We lost 'em, man! We're just wastin' our time. You know something? You are really beginning to piss me off! Where he goes, we go. Now shut the fuck up! [Kid] Yo! ##[Rap, Indistinct] Yo! Hey, what's up? Yo, man, these the punks you saw, man? No, they ain't the ones. You punks crazy or somethin', man? Chill out, man. - Were just lookin' for some citizens. - He lookin' for some citizens. You ain't gonna find nobody down here like that, man. This is our block. If you got any brains... you'll break now and don't look back. - We got business, that's all. - Oh, you got some business, man? Yeah. What kind of business you got? Wait a minute, right? I've had about enough of this bullshit. I'm gonna ventilate your little cranium. What about that, huh? [Sykes] Now back off! [Boy] Hey, man, you'd better get your boy, Jack! - [Fallon] All right. - I got some too, man. Just, uh, a little bit too much meat today. That's all, man. Come on, man. If you don't like what I have to say, fuck me. Come on. ##[Rap Continues] What you smilin' at? I understand, man. I respect ya. You're taking care of your block. That's great. But these motherfuckers ripped me off. That can't happen. Know what I mean? You know. I don't know. If I fuck with you now, you look like shit in front of your boys. How much is this gonna cost? Man, if I want your money, I'll take it. No, you can't take my money... but you can... take my money. - Go ahead. - Money got blood on it, man. You ever seen any that didn't? Now, go ask Webster over there... - which building those people went into, okay? - All right. I don't believe this. Ray, you're wearin' a hole in the carpet, bro. Cops should've been here by now,: It's been 17 minutes. Down here people die of old age waiting for the cops. No goddamn way. This is bullshit. Watch this. I'll get their asses over here in one goddamn second. What's wrong, Ray? The phone's dead. What do you mean, it's dead? Give me. It must be them. They're here! Maybe you didn't pay your phone bill. - Oh, yeah, right! - Hey, shut up, Ray! "Francis... "Howard... Wyatt." Used to have a girlfriend named Frances. She had blue eyes just like you. - How does he know my name? - Frank, beautiful baby! Wow! Lucky for you she looks just like your wife, huh? What's your wife, Italian? I always wanted to fuck an Italian girl, Frank. I tell you what, Frankie... Francis. Since you won't meet me man-to-man... I'm gonna take my case to the people, all right? The people of the housing projects! I got a headline for ya. This just in: Get the fuck outta my house. I hate this fuckin' place. I wanna go home. Go on. [Baby] Mommy! I wanna drink, smoke... and play my loud music. Honey, come here. - So this misguided individual... - Get the hell out of my house! Is starting to piss me off! Here's the deal: [Baby Crying] Give him up now and this will not be the worst night of your life! There's nothin' on three floors. We got two more to go. We gotta take a break. I told you you should've quit smoking. It's okay. Everything's gonna be all right. [Crying Continues] - We can't stay here. - If we go out there, they're gonna kill us. - [Crashing] - These people put their lives on the line for us! - [Mike] Frank's right. - Yeah, go! [Sykes] Open the fucking door! Let's do it. [Woman Screaming] No way! I'm not going out there! - Don't open it! Okay. - Oh, my God! - Jesus, Ray. - I'm not goin' anywhere. - [Frank] You son-of-a-bitch. - You had that thing the whole time? - Why the hell didn't you use it when we needed it? - Shh! I'm using it now! On us. Yeah. - Whichever one thinks you're gonna get me through that door. - What are you doing? You're scarin' the kid. The cops'll be here any second. Let's wait till they get here. Open it up! - The cops are not coming! - Yes, they are. Stay right back, okay? I am not gonna die down here. - [Gunshot, Yelling] - These people weren't involved, and they helped us. If those bastards find us here, they're gonna kill everybody. Is that what you want? [Knocking] You gotta trust me, man. You don't want this deal. [Clarissa Crying] Come on, Razor. Give me the gun! - [Gasping] - [Crying] [Mike] Okay, let's get outta here. Go to the roof; the kids have a way of getting across to the next building. It's the only chance you have. Thanks a lot. [Door Knob Turning, Hinges Creaking] [Sykes] Hey! [Woman] I have a baby! Please leave us alone! [Sykes] Open the fucking door now! [Sykes] Seen any white guys around here? [Gunshot] Sykes, come on, let's go up to the next floor, man. [Man] You'd better not be lying! Gimme your gun. Gimme your gun! [Sykes] Let's go! [Man] What a shithole! Here. Here, use this. ##[Rap] Knock, knock, faggot. Open the door. Hey, take it easy, man. ##[Rap Continues] [Indistinct Talking] Fuck. I found it! Jesus, that's the escape route? [Mike] Huh? [Panting] Let's do it. [Grunting] Easy. [Frank] Let's go, Ray! [Mike] Over here, over here. Kids do this. Let's go, Ray. [John] Hang on, Mike. Hang on, buddy. - Ray? - I can't. The pipe, Ray. Use the pipe. It's right there. The drainpipe. You can shimmy down that. [Grunting] [Frank] Let's go, Ray. We used to do this kind of thing when we were kids, remember? What the fuck am I doing? Just slide down. Ray, whatever you do, don't look down. Thanks, pal. I wasn't going to. You know, Ray, I've got a great view from down here. Funny, Frank. I'm glad you save your best material for the rooftop show. Thanks. I'll be here all week. Come on, Ray. That's good, that's good. When I get down, I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass. [Both Laughing] [Screaming] [Grunting, Groaning] - John, get your ass across that ladder now. - What are you guys doin'? [Mike]John, there's a way down over here! Let's go, Ray. [Mike] All right, John, come on, buddy. Don't look down, look at me! Okay, that's it. You know, like the 40 yard line, man. Come on. Here you go. You're on the 30 yard line. The 20. Now the 10. [Frank] That's it. All right. Next. Go ahead. I wanna follow you. You go first. You're full of crap, Ray. Climbing across this thing is not gonna kill you. Those guys are! Come on, I swear to God. I can always tell when you're full of crap, Ray, and you are full of crap right now! Don't make me leave you up here. Don't do that to me! Look, I said I would do it! [Mike] Move it! You want me to put it in writing? I will follow you. All right, let's do it. Come on. Watch how simple this is. [Sighs] [Panting] [Ladder Creaking] Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. [John] That's good. That's good, man, all right. This is it. This is nothing, right? [Fallon] There they are! Come on, Frank! - Move it! - Come on, Frank! Motherfucker! - [Fallon Screams] - There! I don't believe these guys got guns. Yeah, too easy these days. [Ladder Creaking] [Ray] Frank! Go ahead, check it out. Frank! [Laughing] Nice move. [John] Come to me, goddamn it. [Mike] Come on, Frank. [John] Frank, come on. Come on, Frank, come on, buddy, come on. Give me your hand. [Grunting] Come on! Come on, Frank! I got you. I got you. Come on, come on. Okay. [Panting] Ray! What are you doin'? I ain't no acrobat. I'm gonna negotiate with these guys. What with, Ray? I got these guys right where I want 'em. - Frank, come on! - I'm the Razorman, remember? - Let's go. - Come on. [Mike] Come on! Easy, fellas. Hear me out a second. Just give me a chance to talk, okay? What do you wanna talk about? Something near and dear to my heart... money. Money. Money's good. Yeah. Money makes the world go 'round. Mike! You fire, they'll kill him for sure. And if I don't? Start talking. There's no reason for any of this to be happening. Whatever happened to that kid, I'm sure he deserved it. That's your business. That's your business. Nobody's going to the police. All we want to do is get home. Home. Home is where the heart is, right? Uh... excuse me for a minute. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but, uh... didn't you say somethin' about money? Yeah, I did. How about $100,000 cash? Then we go our separate ways. You can raise that kind of money? Wow. Yes, I can. Let me ask you somethin'. Those shoes, what are those, Italian? - [Sykes Chuckles] - [Hammer Cocks] Yeah, they're actually Italian running shoes. [Laughing] Actually kinda working well for me this evening. Yeah? And your dad's what, he's a, uh, a stockbroker? Somethin' like that. But I'm a self-made guy. I'm a self-starter. Just like you. That's funny. 'Cause these guys are always sayin' that to me. That's why we hang with him. Self-made man. You just name the place. Tomorrow morning the cash will be there. In the meantime, how about a little deposit? Hmm. [Sykes] May I see that? This, this is a beautiful ring. Rhodes, take a look at this. Check this out. Oh, that's beautiful, man. Take this home to your girl. Tell me something, how much is a ring like that worth? Retail, that's 15 K. But for you guys, [Clicking Tongue] Hmm. Call it a down payment, under the table. [Laughing] You know, I think, uh, I think we can cut a deal here. Oh, man, that's beautiful. Yeah. [Ray] There you have it. I can't believe this. He's doin' it. You're pretty good. Wh-What's your name? Ray. Ray, yeah. You're a good negotiator. You didn't even lowball me. I'm gonna come in here and lowball you? Forget about that. Well, the thing is, I gotta trust you. There's the payment of money... and then there's your friends keeping their mouths shut, you know. Now hold on. We're businessmen, both of us. We have an understanding. Oh. Let me tell you somethin', uh, Ray. You don't understand shit. Okay? Nothing. Guys like you gotta keep checking your pants to see if you got a dick. I got one. You and your friends are the kind of spoon-fed fuckin' fruit bait that I fuckin' hate! I don't think you understood me. Shut the fuck up! You speak when fuckin' spoken to, okay? This is not fuckin' high school, motherfucker! I'll eat your fuckin' friends for fuckin' lunch! You know who we are? No, you have no fuckin' idea, do you? No. You just sail through life reading about people like me in the newspaper. Hey! You're in a different place now, motherfucker. Yeah, $100,000 might buy you out in North Shore. Down here that means shit! This is my fuckin' world! Two hundred thousand. [Hammer Uncocks] All right. [Sighing] We got a deal? Yeah. This... You had... You schooled me. [Chuckling] You took my heart off the ground and surgically implanted it. Ray. Ray. In just a little bit, my pulse'll be back to normal. [Panting] God. Ray. [Ray] Music to my ears. Absolutely. I'm gettin' off this roof in one piece. Oh, yeah. Yeah. [Screaming] - No! - [Groaning] - Motherfucker! - Jesus. - Motherfucker! - It's all right. No! Let me go, Frank! Okay, Frank, wait! Okay! Come on, John, let's go! [John Gasping] [Panting] Don't look at him, John. Come on, he's gone, man! ##[Rap, Indistinct] ##[Rap Continues] Come on. Come on. All right. Frank. [Grunting] [Coughs] Shh. [Whispering] We should've done something. Makes no sense for Ray to go out like that. Nothing about tonight makes much sense. I keep hearing him screaming. [Fallon] Hello, ladies. No! Well, well, well, it's our little chicken-shits. [John] Go! Go! [Gunshots] [Panting, Grunting] [Mike] This way! This way! [Grunting] No! Get off! - Frank! - Get down, get down! [Mike] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Go! Aaah! Go, go, go! Aaah! [Groaning] [Mike] This way, this way! Right here! Come on. [Metal Clanging] [Shouting, Cheering] [Frank] Mike. John. We gotta keep moving, man. Split up. Man, this is stupid. You really think we're gonna catch these guys? Yeah. You comin'? Watch your ass. Shit. I always do, Mom. [Fallon Singing] # Oh, when the saints # Oh, shit! # Go marching in # These guys don't give up. # Oh, when the saints go marching in ## They're right on our ass. We gotta get outta here. It's hard to tell where they're coming from. We don't wanna run into them. [Grunts] [Mike] No, no, no, no. It's too bright up there! You might as well stick a bulls-eye on your back. What are we gonna do? We gotta make a stand. It's our only chance of gettin' out of here alive. I always wondered how I'd do in combat. Could I cut it? You ever wonder about that, Frank? - Guess I'm about to find out. - [Chuckles] - Mike, they got guns. We have nothing! - Screw the guns. If we watch each other's back, we'll be... we'll be okay. Right? Huh? - There you go, Johnny boy. - Let's do it. Hey, Frank... let's show these punks what we got. [Exhales] Right. [Mike] Hey, there's three ways in here, there's three of us. We watch each other's backs, huh? [Sighs] Okay, let's go! Go! [Travis] Sykes! Rhodes! You guys down there? [John] Mike. Mike! I got your back. [Mike] Hey, I'm relyin' on you, bro. [Rumbling] [Rats Squeaking] [Whispering] Frank! Frank! [Squealing Continues] [Grunting] - Yaah! - [Metal Clangs] Where're you guys at? - Hey, don't you move. Don't you move. - [Sighs, Sniffs] All right, who's the chicken-shit now, huh? You gonna shoot me? Hey, hey, hey, hey. You ever shoot anybody before? I don't think so. Now, if you don't give me that back... the same thing that happened to your friend Ray is gonna happen to you. Oh! - Ohh! - [Gunshot Echoing] [Sykes Groaning] Man, did you see the look on his face? He didn't think I could do it. [Fallon] Sykes! Talk to me, man! Let's move. No, screw that! Hey, I say we stay down here and we finish 'em. You know, things are a little different now, huh? What is the matter with you, huh? This isn't a goddamn game! John, let's go. Hey! Hey, wha... What happened to you, kid? Hey! Hey, I thought you had my back! Hey, John, I'm talkin' to you! We gotta find some cover. What the hell happened to you down there? Um... Huh? I'm sorry. Sorry doesn't cut it. You almost got me killed! [Groans] Hey! Back off, Mike. Your baby brother fucked up. He better not do it again! Oh, yeah? Or what? [Chuckles] See, that's the Frank I used to know. You better believe it. Now let's get off the street. Yes, sir, boss. This is great. You know, I don't know about you guys, but I didn't sign on for this. This is your fault, Fallon. Your best buddy's dead because of you and your goddamn rules. Hey! You ever hear the one about takin' care of your own? Huh? You mean, you'd let these guys get away with this, right? No, I wouldn't let these... Ohh! You know what I hate? I hate whiners, you know. I hate people who just complain, complain, complain. Had a guy in the joint one time, cell next to me, you know. He used to yap about everything. Used to yap about the food, yap about the guards. And yap about this, and yap about that, and yap, yap, yap all night long. Fuckin' yap, yap, yap, like a fuckin' 747. You know what I mean? Like an engine stuck right between your ears and you can't get away from it. I don't think he's gettin' up. It's gone now. [Sighs] [Sighs] [Wind Whistling] [Footsteps] Oh, damn it. If those assholes were here right now, I'd, I'd... I'd... probably just freeze. I tried, you know. I couldn't move, Frank. John, you gotta keep it together, man. Keep it together? Fuck you, Frank! I'm scared. [Sobbing] I'm really scared. And I don't think I'm gonna make it through this fuckin' night. I don't know what to do. John. Come here, come here. No, Frank, no. [Sobbing Continues] Everybody gets scared. No. Whether they admit it or not. I'm scared too. [Sniffing] Look at me. I'm cryin' like a baby here. Thanks... for stickin' up for me back there. Yeah, well, Mike's as scared as we are. Hey. There's... nobody out on the street. So what do you think, boss? Why don't you cool it on that "boss" stuff? [Bus Approaching] [Frank] You guys aren't gonna believe this. [Laughing] Let's go! Hey! Hey, yo! Wait! Wait! Hey! Hey, we're here! Hey, stop! Look, hey... [Mike] Hey, lady! Hey, hold up the bus! What are you doin'? Hey! Hey! [Frank] Stop the bus! I don't think so. Hey, come on! Come back, you bitch! Hey! Stop! [Panting] Come back. Come back! Mike, you're gonna give us away! I don't get it! You used to have bigger balls than anybody! Is that what this is about? Balls? What about using your goddamn brain? Watch what you say to me! What are you tryin' to prove, Mike? That you can get us killed? Because that's exactly what you're gonna do! I got a wife and a little girl, and I will get back to them! You wanna go out like a goddamn hero? Then you do it alone. Let's go, John. Frank! Frank! What, goddamn it? Just wait up. [Sighs] No? Maybe there's another way in. It's kinda dark. I don't see anything. There's gotta be a security guard on duty. Well, let's try and, uh, wake him up! [Alarm Ringing] Hello? We're in trouble now. [Laughing] [Ringing Continues] Hello? - [Bell Ringing] - Hey, concierge, I need a room! Hell of a security system. Excellent response time. Hey! Yo! Anyone home? [Mike Yelling] Hello? Anybody here? We're here to rob the place. Anybody got a problem with that? [Shouting Continues] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yo, come on and get us! [Man] Okay, freeze! [Mike Laughing] There's two of em! I said freeze! Now, put your hands on top of the counter and spread 'em! Do it! Well, anything you say. All right, we're freezin'. Yeah, we're freezin' and we're spreadin'. Anything else you want us to do? You frisk 'em. I'll call 5-O. Uh-oh, they're callin' the cops. Hey, that's 9-1-1, buddy. [Laughing Continues] Tell 'em to haul their ass. These kids are loaded. [Ringing Continues] [Dialing] [Grunts, Groans] Let's get to work. Listen, man, the reason... Just save it, punk! These guys have been after us... Look! You tell it to the cops. They get paid to listen to your bullshit stories. [Patting] Hey, watch it. Careful, I'm ticklish. [Patting] Uh, uh, mister, there's one thing I... No! Put your hands back up on the cooler! Put 'em up on the cooler! You understand me? - Don't make a move! - Okay. [Fallon On P.A.] Attention, shoppers. We have a special... in the frozen foods department tonight: Dead meat. Plump, juicy and fresh from our North Shore farm. Shop 'til you drop, right, Frank? Get back on that cooler! Get on there! Hey, get on there! You guys tell your friend to get his ass down here! This guy's not our friend. I'm tired of foolin' around! You understand me? Motherfucker!

I think I'm gonna pay a little visit on that wife of yours. [Creaking] [Grunts] [Gasps, Choking] [Gunshot] What did you say you were gonna do to my wife? What's the matter, asshole? Why so quiet all of a sudden? Aaah! [Grunting] You fuckin' dog! [Grunts] Ow! Ohh! Uhh! Oh! Jesus Christ. You're Frank? [Groaning] Look at me when I'm talkin' to you. [Groaning Continues] Hey!

Bet you got a nice house up there, huh, Frank? Hmm? Can't wait to meet your daughter. What's her name again? Ah, it doesn't matter. You'll never see her grow up anyways. No more! [Grunting] [Groaning] Help me, for Christ's sake. I knew you'd do the right thing. [Grunting] Come on, Francis. You're comin' with me. No! Nooo! Come on, Francis. [Grunting] You're on your own, pal. [Grunts, Yelling] [Panting, Grunting] And don't call me Francis. [John] Frank! Frank, you all right? Where are ya? Stay where you are! Everything's all right! It's over.

Look, my brother and my friend are bleedin' to death upstairs. Get down on the floor. You're not listening to me! Down! I don't fuckin' believe this. Hey, Al, he's tellin' the truth. It's like a battleground out here. Come on. Don't worry, you're gonna be fine. [Wheezing] Excuse me. How is he? He's lost a lot of blood, but his vital signs are good. Take it easy. Take it easy, man. Take it easy. Hey, buddy, they say you're gonna be okay. [Gasping] I better... I better be. I got tickets to the Bears game next week. [Chuckles] Well, you have a good time. Wait. I got seats on the 50 yard line. Listen, I'm gonna be home with Linda and the baby watchin' the game on TV. [Laughing Continues] You... You're a wimp. Hey, John. Yeah?
