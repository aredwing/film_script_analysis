Fabien and his friends have been training in china for the past nine years, notably at the famous shaolin monastery. Fabien, this award is a very good start. So what's the next step for you and your team? - We all want to move to hollywood, take our chances and see what happens. - Hollywood? - C'mon, man. You don't have to do this shit. C'mon, man, shit, man. Just lemme go, alright? Just... - Are you happy now? - Happy birthday, baby. Happy birthday, man. Nice camera, dude. Ahh, that's so cute. The camera model you wanted. - You're welcome. Happy birthday. - That's nice, wow. - Nice. Thank you, thank you. We thought you might need it to shoot your next award-winning show film. - Just need something to shoot now. - Another gift. - Ooh, who is this one from? - Don't know. Just some address. - That's weird. - A secret lover maybe? Ooh, eh? - Wow, a slate. - Nice. "The price of success." Yeah. - And... action. Here is my wife. - Hi, baby. - Here's her friend. Hello. And here is our buddy, jess. Are you happy to be going back to china? - I miss you already. What's that? I say, are you happy to be going back to china? - Oh! What? - I haven't told fabien yet. Oh, sorry. - You haven't told fabien what? - ...'cause I wanted to make sure I had the job before telling you. And I know how important it is to you that the z team succeed here in l.A. - And I thought it was important for all of us. Of course. I mean, I'd rather stay here with you guys but our careers aren't even close to being off the ground. - To tell you the truth, I already knew you were leaving. I'm sorry. - Oh. Of course, it's hard to keep a secret between brothers, meilu. - Yeah, but you could have told me. - When are you leaving? - They want me to work for them before the Hong kong film festival. - He is very famous in china. I think it's great. You should be proud, jess. - Thank you. - You'll be close to. - Yeah, instead of becoming. - You see, that's why I didn't tell you. Hey, guys, chill out. Let's go have a drink, huh? C'mon. - You know what? We all just need to grow up. We cannot keep chasing this dream forever. - Did you get that? Why would you say that? Okay, let's turn off this camera. - No, no, no. Keep recording. I want to see that. Okay. - We need to be more realistic. I mean, don't you think if we were good enough we'd already be making our movie by now? I mean, we've got talent and, fabien, you're a good director but the business is tough. I think maybe it's time for all of you to start considering something else. - I just think we don't want it bad enough. We need to get out there, make sacrifices. Sacrifices? I left my wife in china to be here. - I know. I just think we're waiting too long for things to happen. For spielberg to come get all of you. We need to fight for it. He has to be all existence. - That's a bit much, don't you think? - No, I don't. I don't want to die before we've made our movie. And we're getting old. So time commences right now. - You make it sound so easy. I mean, yeah, winning an award for a short film is one thing but getting money for a feature film, that's much harder. You need money, a lot of money. Why don't you understand that? - If you spent as much time helping us find that money as you spent finding your new job, maybe we would be shooting by now. Fabien! - Look, sorry, for having other ambitions. I guess I missed you knocking down spielberg's door. - You know what? Fuck you. This is important for me. You guys don't really give a shit. Aw, fabien... Okay, let's turn this thing off. Hey babe, are you there? - Did you get a call back? - Yeah, exactly... - She's gonna be so pissed. - Yeah, much more than you think. - Yeah, I know we're late. - No, you're just in time. What? - Listen to me carefully. - Who are you? Who I am is not important. What's important is that I have meilu. - Is this a joke? Unfortunately for you, it's not. But if you do everything as I say, then she won't get hurt. - You're kidding, right? Stop asking questions. I have meilu. That should be your only concern. - How do I know you're telling the truth and you simply haven't stolen her phone? Give her the phone. I'll send you something. - Who is this guy? - Oh, fuck! - God! - We need to call the police. - Can't be real, right? - If you lay a hand on her... Now that I have your attention, her future's in your hands, so all four of you go to the trash can in front of you. There's a black bag in it. Take it out and open it. - To the trash can. - Why the trash can? Hey, what's happening? What did he say? What's going on? - I don't know. - This is crazy. - What is this? - Fabien, do you know anyone who wants to hurt you? - No. - Do you owe someone money? - No. - Come on, there's got to be someone. - I don't know what, I don't know. - Just calm down. Let's figure this out. What's in the bag? - Yeah, what's in the bag? What's this? - Call the police. I wouldn't do that if I were you. That call will bring her immediate death. I don't think you understand the gravity of this situation. Perhaps if I send you one of meilu's pretty little fingers, you'll start listening to me. - What do you want? Each one of you take a collar and fasten it around your neck. When attached, that collar will transmit a gps signal of your location. And if you take it off, I'll know it and meilu dies. Now throw your personal cell phones into the trash can. The phone I provided you is programmed to call one number and that's mine. And you can't use it for any other purpose. And if you don't listen, then meilu dies. And if you try to contact the cops, then she dies. And if you do anything other than what I say, she dies. - Okay, we do what you want. In five minutes, an armored truck will stop in front of the united bank which is right down the street. And you're to unload that truck of its precious cargo. - It's a trick, right? You have four minutes before the truck's arrival. Good luck. - An armored truck? - You cannot expect us to attack an armored truck. - He has meilu. - That means he's fucked up. - Hey, we can't let fabien do it alone, right? - Look, we have to help him. He's watching us. He'll know if we don't. - We have four minutes to get there before that truck. I don't have a choice. - Three minutes now. - Fuck. - Sh... - Do you realize what he's asking us to do? - We get it, didier. - We get it. - We simply explain our self to the security guard. - There is no time for that. Jess, lohan, are you with me? - Yes, I'm in. - If something goes wrong, we surrender, okay? - I don't think they're allowed to shoot if we're not armed. - How much time until the truck gets here? - None. Oh damn it. So what's the plan? - So what do we do now, huh? - It's alright. Just act natural. - Yeah. - Nothing happened. We don't want to blow this. We need a plan. - Did you guys see that last soccer game? It was good, right? - Aw shit. - No, no, no. - We need a plan. - We can't. You guys go pretend you're standing in line at the atm. You take care of the guards when they come out. I take out the driver. Okay? - Just do it. - We are dead. Jeez. - How you doing, man? - I'm gonna go help fabien. You guys wait for the guards to come out, okay? - Yeah, alright. What the...? - Let's go, let's go. - Let's get outta here. The fun begins. There's a dumpster right in front of you. Just throw the money bag in it. - Why are you stopping? What are you doing? Just keep going straight. There'll be a restaurant on your left-hand side. - What did he say? - Go, go, go, go, go. Come on, let's go. Okay, sit down. - Sit down. Sit down. - What, what? - Relax, okay? You did great. Now count to 10 and go pick up the money bag. - What? - He want us to go back and pick up the money. - Do you realize what we just did? - Yes. - Fuck! - Okay, let's go. A black suv is parked at the end of the run. You'll find the keys in the glove compartment. - Okay. - It should be over there. - Let's go, c'mon. - Go, go, go. - Hello? Go to 5003 branford street. It's an abandoned hospital. - Is meilu there? 5003 branford street. - So where we going? - We're gonna end up in prison. - We need to find the nearest cop and turn ourselves in. They can help us. - Fabien, you have a cop friend, right? Why don't you call him? - I don't know. And how do we call discreetly? - A public phone. We can use that. - But if this guy is spying on us, we can't risk it. And he would see us with this shit. - No, okay, we'll call your friend, explain everything, as soon as we get meilu back. - Okay, fine. - I think this is it. 5003 branford street. - What is this? An abandoned hospital? - Let's find out. - So what are we supposed to do here? - In case it's a trap. - Where is this fucking phone? - Here. Come here. Got it. Leave the money here. - And where's meilu? The deal was the money for meilu. Leave the money here and go to... - Look, we got you the money. You give us meilu. That was the deal. If you just do what I tell you to do, you'll see her again real soon. - Look, we have already done everything that you wanted, okay? So give us meilu, we give you the cash and we won't say anything. - Enough, okay? You're not in a position to negotiate with me. You're wanted by the police and if you want to see meilu again, you'll do what I say. - And how do I know you haven't already killed her? - Okay, fabien, your friends can stay here and watch the money while you come for meilu. Then you can call them when you have meilu and then you can leave the money behind. Now get back into the car and keep the first cell phone. - Shit. - Don't give the money to anybody before you talk to me, okay? - We won't. - And be careful. - Here, take the gun. - Keep it just in case. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Be careful. - I don't like how this is getting worse. Go to the church at 1711 west avenue street and hollywood. - A church? Yeah, I thought you might want to confess to your crime. - Fuck you. - This doesn't feel right. - What do you suggest we do? - There's nothing to do. We have to wait to hear from him. That's it. - Okay, I'm here. - Sorry, jesus, but I have to kill this man. - Welcome to the house of god. - Is the guy on the phone? - No, I don't think so. - Where's meilu? - You know, it's gonna be easier than I thought. Hey, turn on that camera. - What is this bullshit? Where's my girl? - Your girl? Hey, padre. - Shame on you. - What the hell did you do to his girl? - Why are you doing this? - Congratulations, fabien. You've been chosen to star as the lead in my new film. - What the hell are you talking about? - You and your z team pals came to hollywood with a dream. Now you're gonna become famous but you, fabien, you're gonna be my star. That is if you survive scene 72. - Give me meilu and we give you your money. - You know, I don't care about the money. That part is already done. It's all about the film. And if you want to see meilu again, then just finish my film. Play your part and survive. - I'm a good shepherd and I will do as you command. Amen. - What do you want from me? Tell me. - Do you believe in god? 'Cause he is watching you. My angels... Kick his ass. Come on, boys, show him the way it's done. Come on. Damn it. Get him! You, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Wake up and fight, come on! Come on, come on, attack! Argh, come on. Goddamn it. And kick his ass, come on, kick his ass. Kick his ass! Argh, I need to do everything myself. - Where is she? - Who? - Meilu. - I don't know. We were just doing this for the money. What money? - We were paid to fight you for a movie, that's all. - Thank you, my son. Oh god, thank you. - Go phone the police. - You're a hero. Well done. You truly are a star. - I'm going to kill you. Stop whining. You should be happy. You wanted to be famous. Now you're gonna get your wish. If we finish my film and you survive, you'll be the newest action star. But I have to warn you, the scenes are only gonna get tougher. - You know what? I'm gonna find meilu and then I'm gonna find you. And then I'm gonna kill you. - If you survive, you'll find your girl at the end of the film and a happy ending. But if you don't survive, then neither will she. - You're sick. - You have seven minutes to get to the karate dojo at the corner of hewitt and wilshire. - So how long are we supposed to wait here? - What do you want to do? - Look, nothing's changed. We wait to hear from fabien. Hang on tight to this money because it's our only ticket out of this mess. - You know, I really think we should reconsider going to the police. Come on. - What is it? - Go, go, go, go, go, go. Move, go, go. - Go, go, go. - What do we do? - You're surrounded. You have one minute to come out with your hands up. - Shit. - Come on, let's get out of here. Come on. - Hey, hold on, hold on. - Hello? Fabien? - Okay, you're surrounded. Just don't panic and do as I say. - Where are meilu and fabien? They'll be fine as long as you escape with my money. - They are coming in... But there is nowhere to escape. It's a freakin' circus out there. - Okay, I can see everything. Just trust me and I'll get you out alive. - What does he want? - Go, go, go, go, go. - They're coming in. Take a right and start to run. Turn left. - Now what? - Okay, wait. Okay, go now. - Go. Turn right. Don't move. One man's gonna enter. Get ready to fight. - Freeze! Get up slow. I said, "get up." Get up. Slowly. - Hey, it's alright. Just calm down. We can go. Get the phone. - Turn right. - Come on. Wait! They're coming from over there too. Hide. - Fuck. They're coming. Hide. - Freeze! Let him go. Let him go now. Come on. Come on. - They're right behind you. Run faster. - Faster. Take the tunnel on your right. - There's a tunnel on the right. - Right here, come here, come here, let's go. Almost out. They're coming from upstairs. Hide until they leave. - They're coming from upstairs. - Freeze! Don't move. Put your hands in the air. Good. Very good. So go upstairs, take the door and you're out. - The exit's upstairs. - Here, take these. - I am not gonna use this. - Look, we don't know how this is gonna end up. But I prefer to be the one with the guns this time. - Yeah, you're right. - Come on, let's go. - Come on. Bravo. Brilliant escape without a single shot. You know, you're much better than I expected. - What? - What's he saying, what's he saying? As I explained to fabien, the four of you are the stars of my new movie. Fame and fortune are at your fingertips, boys. - Oh, yeah? How is that? You heard me. Smile, movie stars. The police are still after you. There's a gray car right in front of you. Take it. The key is in the ignition. - How'd he tape everything? Of course I did. It's a film. You have eight minutes to bring the money to the old paper factory at the 25th street. - What? Hey, wait. Wait! It's like we are rats in his maze. - C'mon, hurry, let's go. - Shit! - Come on, come on. - Hello. - There is no phones in here. Remember, "enter the dragon"? All good martial arts films have their heroes fight multiple black belts. - You sick fuck. This is real. The film is choreographed. Reality tv? This is a reality film. Succeed in your role and all your dreams will come true. - You better not hurt her. - Worry less about meilu and concern yourself more with my film. Now I want to see lots of action. - And how do I do that? Improvise. You're an actor. - Great. Are you sure of the address? I don't know. I think I am. Let me ask them. - Where the hell do you think you are? - I'm looking for a dojo. Am I in the wrong place? This looks like a dance studio. - Get out of here. - But I didn't get my dance lesson yet. - Are you crazy? Get the hell out of here before I break your face. - Take your best shot, asshole. - You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson alright. What are you waiting for? Bravo. Impressive. - I'm done. Where's meilu? Dojo compton avenue and central. - He gave you everything? - Yes. - Very nice. Yes? They'll be here any minute with the rest of your money. - Alright. But let me ask you something. What did these men do to you? Why do you want them dead so badly? It's in the script. - Script? The script. What fucking script? - I think it's here. - What is this place? - So what now? - It's not open. - Great. - Scene 74, interior paper factory. Like all the other scenes, the place is full of hd surveillance cameras. This scene is like "gunfight at the ok corral." - A gunfight? - Inside there, are several men expecting my money. Don't give it to them. - What? We can't keep fighting guys for your amusement, okay? Just take the money and let fabien and meilu go. If you lose the money, you lose them. It's a simple scene. Kill or be killed. - Hey, we're actors, not professional killers. - So act like a killer. And action. - We are dead. - Don't worry. We'll find another way out. - No, no, no. Wait. - What? - You were in the army before so tell me how to use this. - Here. - Right. Safety's off. Cock it back. And then you point and shoot. You got it? - Yeah, I guess. - Alright. C'mon, follow me. - There is no one here. - Look out! - Shit, stop! Don't shoot. - We don't need to kill each other. - Okay. Then why don't you go ahead and hand over that money you got there? - I'm sorry, we can't do that. - T. Well, then. It looks like you're going to fucking die. - Hey, we're armed too. This is gonna end real bad for all of us. - There are only three of you and there are many more of us. - So what do we do? - We have no choice. We have to fight for fabien. - Shit. - Stay here with your brother. Go! - Damn it. - Stay here and cover me. - You wanted a show? Here you go. - Hey! You listen up. You hand over that money right now and I let you walk out of here. I don't care about the guy. I just want my money. - You want it? Come and get it. - Hey, you're already injured. Yeah, I got you once, motherfucker. You will die here if you don't give me my money. - If I give you the money, another friend of mine and his wife will die. And I can't let that happen. - I'm going to give you one more chance and that's it. Do you surrender? I guess that means no. - Go. I said go. Cut his fucking head off. - Drop it. That's it, nice and slow. Alright, stand up. Turn around. Stupid bitch. C'mon, I'm gonna crush you like a bug. C'mon! Yeah. - Didier, get down! No! Jess! Jess, jess. - Jess, no! Jess, jess, jess. You'll be okay, jess. - No. - Are you okay? - Jess. - I've been better. - You'll be okay. We go to hospital. - No, no, I'm gonna stay here. He'll kill fabien and meilu if we leave. It's gonna be too late, by the time... - Jess. - Jess. - No, just save fabien and meilu. - We can't let you die like this. Jess. No, no, not yet. Jess. You're not dead yet. Jess. Wake up, jess. - You piece of shit. I'm gonna fucking kill you. Forever through his performance in my film. - I'm gonna find you... And I promise you. Chase me or save your friends, it's your choice. Corner of ninth street and belmont, number 455, you have eight minutes. Ask for chan. Hello? Just to your right between the two dumpsters, there's a bag. Open it. Strap the camera to your head. Drink the bottle. - You know everything so you know I don't drink. I'm not asking. Now drink. - Aghh! Now you're gonna go across compton avenue down to 100 street. - You're crazy. That's one of the most dangerous areas of los angeles. Our film can't be any good if there isn't a sense of danger. - You just want me dead, you sick fuck. Stop talking or she dies. Now finish that bottle. - What the hell? Hey, man check this shit out. - You looking for a cave, white boy? - Yo, he must be lost or something - yo, where you goin', snow white? - 'Scuse me, motherfucker, I'm talkin' to you. - Oh, pussy-ass white boy. - Oh hell no, motherfucker. Oh shit. Get the car, motherfucker, get the car! Where do you think you going, man? Where do you think you going? He can't run from us. - I'm talkin' to you. Where d'you think you're goin', man? - C'mon, white boy. You in the wrong place at the wrong time. - ...that thing on your head. You gotta pay the tax fool. I'm sorry, man. - You sorry? - Got to give me something, man. You gotta give me something, come on. - Come on white boy. - Shut the fuck up, white boy, for real. - You think you tough? - Back up that shit. Let me count that shit. - What else you got? What else you got? - $10, man? C'mon. You gotta have something more than this, man, come on. - Are you fuckin' broke? - C'mon, what else you got? - Give me this shit, cuz. - Gimme that. Sorry, I can't. - Sorry, what? - What the fuck you mean, you can't? Give it to him, man. - Sorry, I think you can. - Oh, shit. - Ha, ha. - Shit. Shoot 'Im. - Oh, shit, man. - He's fast. Can you shoot, bruce lee? Hm? Come on, man. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Man, put that gun down. - What's up, man. Get him before he goes anywhere. Get him before he turns us off. - We can get him on the straightway. Turn right. Oh, man. Turn left on the next street. Turn left through the gate. Now what? Enter through the door on the left. Hurry up, hurry up. - You fuck! You led me into a trap again. - Exactly. - White boy, I know you in there, open this door, now. Now take off the camera. - I'm guessing. They're coming after me and I have to beat them all up. - Oh, wow, you're getting smart. - I've got to tell you. From a creative point of view, your scenes are getting redundant, kind of boring actually. - Yeah, nonsense. You know, voyeurism, abduction, bank robbery, fights to the death... - Death? Who died? - Nobody yet, but maybe it'll be you. - Fuck you. - In this scene, I want a traditional Hong kong kung fu-style fight, the drunken style which every kung fu expert masters. - Are you crazy? The drunken fist is more for show than anything else. I will get myself killed. - Alright, wait. I have it right here in front of me. Yep, scene 110, hero enters warehouse and fights for his life and the life of his woman using traditional kung fu drunken style. Sorry, it's got to be drunken style kung fu. - You're really out of your mind. - Alright, here they come. Good luck. - There you go. Fuck this white boy up. - Now let's get this motherfucker. - I know a drunken style. - Oh, shit! - Gonna cut your ass up. - Shit! What the fuck? I'm kind of busy. Don't you see? - Okay, change of plan. Kill them. - What? No. - Fine. Movie ends and meilu dies. - You man, get up. I said, "get up." You know what, man? When this is over, after I kill you, I'm gonna find your little girlfriend and I'm gonna make her my bitch. Let's go. Shit! - Shit. You broke my leg. But, fuck, just... c'mon, man. You don't have to do this shit. C'mon, man, shit, man. Just lemme go, alright? Just... Are you happy now? Where is she? - What do you want? - Follow me. - You'll get this on the way out. - You're mr. Chan? - You must be my actors. We've been expecting you. - What do you want? - You know, I've been in this business a very long time. And I've met some crazy motherfuckers. But your friend has got to be the craziest of them all. - Who is he? - They call him "the filmmaker." And yes, he is crazy. But he does pay well. I mean, he did give me a lot of work installing all this equipment. These cameras look familiar? Prepare their fights. Oh, and this. For the winner of the fights. - What is this? - His instructions were simple. Install the equipment, have them fight the best of the best fighters and, for the winner, this envelope. - I'm tired of this fucking game. Where is this guy, the filmmaker? - Who knows? Behind the cameras? Tsk, tsk, tsk. You have to win your fights first. - Come on, you pussy. Bring your bitch ass over here. Come on, right now. - Nobody fuck with neutron! - This isn't a movie, my friend. You and your brother will die tonight. - I got it. - Noooo! Didier. - You'll be fine. - It hurts. - I have to get you to a hospital. - No. - You'll tire yourself. Come on right here and press down tight, okay? I'm going for help. Stop talking, relax. - Just in case... - What? - I just wanted to tell you... - Didier. Didier. Didier. Didier! Noooo! - You've made it to the final fight. If you win, you'll see meilu again. - What do I have to do? Just stay where you are. Aghhh! - Now what? Hello? - Fabien? - Lohan, is that you? - Yeah, it's me. - Is everything okay? And how did you get this number? - Where are you? - I'm in a warehouse next to compton and 100 street. He told me that my last thing was right here. Are you guys okay? Lohan, are you there? - They are dead. - What? - It's just me, man. The others are dead. That son of a bitch hired thugs to kill us. He switched suitcase and used the money to pay them. We tried to fight them but... Look, doesn't matter now. I'm coming to you. - I can see that this hasn't been any fun for you either. - All this is my fault. - It's not your fault. It's that bastard. I'm gonna kill him. - I should have gone to the police. - I'm covered with jess and didier's blood. I have to kill whoever killed them. - We're gonna find that son of a bitch. And once we've got meilu, we make him pay. - What did he say exactly? - He told me that I was almost finished. And I will see meilu again if I won my final fight. They paid you shit. - I'm coming for you. You hear me? - I'm sending you a video. - What did he say? - He will send us a video. - Fuck. Lily. Fuck! - Damn. - You bastard. I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out. Let my wife go. - So here's the deal. You two will fight to the death and whoever wins gets the prize. - You sick piece of shit. - We won't do it. - If you don't fight, I'm gonna dismember every part of their tight beautiful little bodies. - Oh, fuck. Okay, let's play around a bit to buy some time until we figure something out. Ready? Your phone. Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? - Stop it. Stop it! - Are you gonna make me cut them up or are you gonna fight? - Are you okay? - I'm gonna fucking kill you! - Stop it. Nooo! I'm sorry. - Where is she? - That was the price of success. We'll meet at your place. - Meilu? - It came in the mail for you. The word "gift" was written on it. - No name? - No, just an address. - It's the price of success. - What you doing, fabien? Hm? - The filmmaker, 4400 seaton street. - It's gonna be a big hit, fabien. - Where are meilu and lily? - I dunno. They're supposed to be here, okay? - Are you crazy? If you don't tell me where they are, I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. - I don't know where they're at, alright? If it's about the fucking money you can have it yourself, okay? - Where is she? Where is she, you fuck? - C'mon, man, I just helped you make this film. Man, come on. - Stop crying to me and tell me where they are. You hear me? You hear me? - You'll fucking kill me. I just followed your script. - What the fuck does that mean? - I just followed your script. - Where is she? - I just followed your script. - Ed, come on in. Thanks for coming. - Yeah, my pleasure. - My new office. Sorry it's a mess but, please, sit down. - Thank you. - So as I've told you on the phone, I have a script that might be of interest to you. - Where is she? Where is she? You hear me? Where is she? Where is she? - You know, this is risky. I dunno, man. This is real shit here. - Listen, you've lost everything. What else is there for you? Think about the money. You get a fortune too. - Okay, I think about the money a lot, alright? But this is crazy. You understand we can go to prison for a long time if this doesn't work out. - I take the risk. We'll never see your face. I give you 50% of the money up front. The other half goes to the other talents. - So you don't want any of the money? - Just the movie's enough for me. Where is she? Tell me. Hey, where is she? So what do you think? - It's excellent. But you know you and your friends might die. - I'm doing it for them too. For all of us. It's our last chance to make it here. Sometimes, one must be willing to pay the price. Is that a problem? - No, not for me. But you know it's highly unlikely it's gonna go as planned. - Believe me, just follow the script and my notes and everything will go as planned. I've got good news and bad news for you. The bad news is lohan is dead. But the good news is he will be an action star. Don't be ungrateful. I gave him what he always wanted. You see, I kept my promise. I made it. Just like I said I would. - After countless hours of editing, I finally finished my movie. If everything goes as planned, I'll be out of the country or, if you're lucky, I might be the guy sitting next to you in the theater. You might be wondering "am I insane?" The answer is I don't know. I'd like to say, "no," but does a crazy person know if he's crazy? And... action. How far would you go for success? How many people would you cheat or steal from? Or even kill to reach your goals? - Damn it, fabien, you scared me. Why are you dressed like that? - I bet you're not so different then. Success always comes with a price tag. Extraordinary things take extraordinary sacrifices. - Where have you been? I went to the bank today. Is there something you want to tell me? According to the banker, you withdrew all of our money last week. - It was gonna be a surprise. - Well, good surprise. What do you do with all the money? - I invested in a film. You told me that you were sick of waiting. I'm in the process of making my movie. - What? - We live in a world where having talent and ambition isn't enough anymore. Sorry, meilu, i need you to scream. - You are crazy. Please scream. - What? What? - People always told me not to give up on my dream. "You're so talented. "Give it some time, you will make it." Fuck you! It's much easier said than done. I need to record you screaming. And crying. - Why are you doing this? - Thank you. I miss my friends but they wanted to be famous and leave a mark in this world. It's just they didn't want it as bad as me. I told you that one day we would make a film together. Are you okay? How many are there in this damn city trying to break into the industry. Trying to make their dreams come true. And how many of them will succeed? Here is what it costs nowadays.
