Bring her out! And bring her luggage too! And don't tell anybody! - Okay, sir! What happened? It's a police officer! He is asking for a girl! Come! Vikram? - At your service! Before leaving I had told you! Either leave me or this gang! For a month I wasn't here. But what did you do, Vikram? Nothing! Nothing! Just try and understand. I can't leave just like that. I need more time. And why are you calling them gang? We do business! I am not doing any illegal work! Is that so? So is that gambling den not illegal? Den? It's a club! Damn it! You people even give bribe to the police. 4 lakhs every month. So what if some gambling goes on there? Life is a gamble. I think my luck is bad! Its okay! I will pack! - No, no! Bye, Vikram!

I will give it to you for 2. 5. But. . the deal should be made in the next week. Yes. Of course I want it. I will confirm it tomorrow. Sir, if the good is nice. . then I can sell it for more than 5 crores. That too within 2 days. There is no problem. I have many contacts. But sir. . why to involve the others? We can fix the deal between ourselves. 2. 5 crores each. Shardul! I could have done this deal alone too! Sir, I was joking! I will call all the partners. Tomorrow the meeting will be at Prakash's office. Prakash-bhai! Say something! Say something! I have been coming here for so many months! If I had cheated, then I would have been caught! He didn't ask me anything! Directly he started beating me! And he! I don't even know him! His name, address, I don't know anything! I don't know how he came and sat besides me! I think he must have done it! He must have done everything, Prakash-bhai! Hey! Shut up! Look! Look! Prakash-bhai, say something! I have some respect in the market. Shut up! Pick one!

Keep him at Ganja's table. Ganja is making loads of money. Now you will play on behalf of the company! Go, Diesel! - Yes, sir! Go and play! Best of luck! Sir, shall we let him go? Akram!

No! I gave it up! - Oh my God! This is great! 14 days, 8 hours, 30 minutes! The club is working fine. Shardul was saying its incurring loss. Shardul! - Yes! He wants to construct a hotel here! - Oh! Because of Mr. Seshadri I am tolerating him! Otherwise I would have chopped him into countless pieces! Oh no! Shardul-bhai! You will live a long life! I was remembering you only! Shardul! Is this the time to call? My mother is in the hospital! I am tense! Tell me! What do you want? Why do you always enter by the back door? Shortcut! Your shares! Global Corp has touched 270!

It's impossible, Mr. Seshadri! Even if I try all the sources still I can't amass more than 10- 12 lakhs. Sir, give me one week's time. I will somehow arrange it. Prakash, it's important to fix the deal within 3 days! Otherwise Kalyan will sell the goods to somebody else. What about the rest? My mother is not fine. So I. . sold the flat on the 4th floor, sir. Last week. I thought I will buy the ground floor flat. But now. . I will buy the flat later. I have the money. What about you? Sir. . I invest my friends' money. So I will take a loan from them! I have no problem, sir! So now only you have a problem, Prakash. The problem can be solved. This place. Sell it to me. Look, Shardul! We all are partners of this club! And we equally share the profits. Don't we? But this club's property is mine! The land is mine! I have already cleared this! Sir, explain it to him! If you want to construct a hotel. . . .why don't you build it somewhere else? Why are you getting infuriated? Take out the money! Relax, man! Prakash is right! This property belongs to him. He can sell it or keep it. He can do anything. That's his wish. But Prakash. . if you didn't arrange for the money with 3 days. . . .then Shardul will pay the balance. And Shardul will get the profit too! Got it? "I was ignorant. Where have I got lost?" "I was nave. I have become yours." "I got inflamed and doused." How is sister's mood? Today is my lucky day! How much have you lost? What kind of a wife are you? You show attitude in hearing good news too? Then say it quickly! Vikram has seen a place in Bandra. It's awesome! And Naidu. . his friend is ready to buy the place! You have the papers, don't you? The work will be done within a week! I don't want to buy or sell anything! Do anything you want! Varsha, at least see it once. The place is awesome! Had it been cards, it would have been 3 Aces. Varsha! Give me the papers! If you eyed my parlour. . I will leave you! Taking Chickoo with me!

And it will reach Bangalore the next day on 24th at 7 o'clock. Kalyan will meet you in the first class waiting room. You will hand over the money to Kalyan. You will collect the goods from him. And you will return to Mumbai by the same train. Meaning you will reach Mumbai on 25th. And on that day we will celebrate his birthday too! Fine? Yes, sir! Yeah! Prakash. . you will arrange for Shiva's ticket. And you will drop him and receive him from the station. Done, sir. First class coupe. I will check it. Sir, my wife. - What happened? What happened? I wanted the bank locker key. It's my friend's marriage. So. . Come! Couldn't you ask for it in the morning? Was it necessary to come here? Leave! Hello, Minni! How are you? Greetings, sir! How are you? - I am fine. Sorry to disturb you. - No, no! It's okay. How is your class going on? - Fine, sir! Okay! Good luck! - Bye. Good luck. - Thank you. How long have you known her? - Sir, who? Come on! You know it well! - Sir, I don't understand. Shardul's wife. Shardul is a dangerous man. He can do anything. I love her, sir! - She too loves you so much? Yes, sir! - I will pray! Hey! What happened? What did he do? I have brought all the jewelleries and money. . . . kept in the locker! Now I don't want to go back! Please, Vikram! Let's go somewhere! Anywhere! Please! But what happened suddenly? Not suddenly. It has been going on for years. Now I can't take it anymore. Where are you going, Vikram? - Let me go, Minni! Vikram! You won't go to meet Shardul! Nothing will happen! Just let me go! Don't be mad! He will kill you! - So what to do? Where will we go? Nagpur? Manipur? Wherever we go, he will find us. He will accuse us of robbery. Do you want the police to follow us? You don't know him! A deal is going to be fixed after 2 days. Of 2. 5 crores. After that we will run away! Not to Nagpur, Manipur but straight to Canada! A few of my college friends stay there. We get the citizenship of that place for 30 lakhs. There is snow. There is skating. In every 8 months there is winter. But if he. . reached there too? If he created a rift there then Niagara falls is there. How many zeros are there in 2. 5 crores? 6! - 1, 2, 3! But we are 5 people. I won't get the entire sum. "What a cruel person has been made?" "Dance with me again! Can I get it right? Can I make it man?" "Who has cast this spell?" "What couldn't happen in so many years!" "Dance with me again! Can I get it right? Can I make it man?" "All that happened in a jiffy." "Rama! Rama! O Rama! Rama!" "Rama! Rama! What has happened?" "My state has become so weird." "Rama! Rama! What has happened?" Beautiful for whom, I won't leave you." Where are you going? To make a drink for you. - Okay. Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! This. . "I won't leave you." Here! Come here! Where are you going? Take this! Buy something for yourself! I don't want anything. You must want something. Dress, goggles, shoes, lipstick, nail polish. Anything. I will keep this inside. If I need anything I will take it. Why are you in a hurry to leave? Can't you sit with me for 5 minutes? I have to warm the dinner. You can even smile and say this. You are happy with me, aren't you? Of course! Of course! Then smile! Sit! Talk to me! Tell me about your aerobic classes. Ask me what I did the whole day! What did you do the whole day? This. . fixing Titanic pieces. . Lovely! Here! Take it! One more! - I will go and warm the dinner! Sit here! Either sit and enjoy the drink with me. . . .or become Rajshree movie's heroine. You be the virtuous wife and I will be the Godly husband. Massage my foot. What do you want to do? Enjoy the drink or massage my foot? Do it nicely. Are you giving a foot massage or shuffling cards? No matter what you do! I won't sell the parlour! We will not sell it. I will only mortgage it. That too for just a week. I am telling the truth. I swear on Chickoo! Don't swear on my son! - Sorry! Sorry! Doesn't Amitabh look so young? What do you mean? He is young! This movie was released before Zanjeer. Parwana. "Don't feel shy." Naveen was the hero. Who could have thought that this thin, tall guy. . . .will someday become a superstar? It's all luck! Not just luck! It's talent too! And the most important thing is timing. Taking the right decision at the right time. He didn't let go of the golden chance. Today we too have a chance, Varsha. You will own a big parlour. We will send Chhotu to some nice school. Varsha, 50 lakhs in 4 days! Just think! Santacruz airport! Quickly! After that I boarded plane for Nagpur at 11 o'clock. Keep the change. All passengers please proceed to the aircraft. . . . marked VT DGF. Thank you. I reached Nagpur at 1 in the night. And I immediately took the cab and went to the station. Railway station! The next day at 11 o'clock the same Kolkata Mail. . . .which I had left at Dadar reached Nagpur. And from the waiting room. . I got into my compartment. This is how I again boarded the same train. . . . in which I had left from VT. Can I get chloroform? - You won't get it here. Why? My cat is sick. I want to put her to sleep. Julie! Julie! Hello, sir! Sir, I have to go to Goa on the 23rd. Can I leave my money at your place? Come. Come. Sir, it has 500 and 1000's bundle, the way you said. Please count it. It's fine. Vicky, you are driving to Goa. It would have been better if you had left in the morning. I slept for long in the afternoon. I am fresh. You have kept 1 crore cash at home like this? Sir, aren't you afraid? Your age too. . - Sir! Sir! I do feel scared. - Sorry, sir! If a thief barged in. . then what will I do? Sorry, sir! Sorry! It's not the age. It's the mileage. 'This is your last chance. Think about it. ' 'Heads, 1 crore. Tails forget about it. ' 'Best of 3. ' 'Best of 3. ' Scoundrel! What's your name? Johnny! Johnny! Now tell me what is your name?

Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. He is really helpful. I will be back in a day or two, sir. Sir, Shiva's departure is confirmed? We will have to again come back at 4 o'clock. So let's go for lunch. Sir, can't we do this tomorrow? Why tomorrow? It will be done today itself. My friend is waiting. - Business cum pleasure! Fine. Tomorrow. But exactly at 10 o'clock. Thank you, sir.

You will go in a cab! It's not about the cab, Shiva! He. . Hang on! Hang on! You guys always fight with each other! We are a group! Be a bit sensible! Shiva, I will come with you. And I will meet your mother on the way in the hospital. Okay. Sure. - I will just get ready and come. Go and tackle whatever it is! - Yes, sir! Thank you, sir! Sorry! Good luck! - Bye. Come, birthday boy! I will get cake for you! - Come on! Bye! - Don't fight! She forgets what happened an hour ago. But she remembers what happened 10 years ago in detail. Doctor says that gradually she will forget writing names and reading. It's a horrible ailment, sir. How are you, mother? Is everything fine? - Everything normal. Greetings. Greetings! Greetings! Who is he? Mother, he is Mr. Seshadri! You have met him! Okay! Okay! Greetings! He too is going to Kolkata! Mother, I am not going to Kolkata! I am going to Bangalore! Yes! That only!

Mother, I will be back within 2 days. But you please take your medicine on time. Please! Okay. - Okay. Do you want anything? Do you want anything from Bangalore? What do you get there? This lemon rice is for you. - Thanks. I will call. - Okay. You take care. Bye. - Bye. What's her name? Vaijanti. By the way Prakash had said it's off season time, sir. The train won't be so crowded. Don't worry. I will manage. - I know you will manage. Call me when you reach there. Okay. And I have packed the meals for you. Sir, you leave. The train is about to leave. Okay. I will call you when I will reach there. Good luck. - Thanks. Sorry, sir! Once again good luck. - Thanks. Vikram! Close the door! "Life is short but demands are many." "The rest are just talks, beloved." "Life is short but demands are many." "The rest are just talks, beloved." "Its just talks." "People say it. . and then forget it." "Hey Johnny." "Life is a gamble. It's a game." "Johnny the deceiver." "Today cash and then tomorrow credit." "Hey Johnny." "Self-interest is the real friend." "Hey Johnny! "It will not come again." "This life." "Why to lead a miserable life?" "Eat and drink to your heart's content." "Why to lead a miserable life?" "Drink to your heart's content." "If you will ask, its mine." "If you will snatch, it's yours." Wait. Hello! What happened, sir? What's the matter, sir? - Come inside. You called me suddenly! Read this. Our Shiva? Yes, Shiva. And the money? Somebody must have done it for money only, isn't it? Would he leave the money behind? But how? How would I know how? Wouldn't I wring his neck if I knew who has done it? Sir, it's written in here it was an accident. Could Shiva have fallen from the train, and. . This is not an accident; this is murder! This is definitely a murder! Murder? But how, sir? Sir, apart from the 5 of us. . . . nobody knew that he had such a big amount of money! That is what is worrying me. It surely must have slipped from somebody's mouth. Did you mention it to somebody by mistake? No, sir. Sir, where are Shardul and Prakash? They have gone to see the dead body. They must have returned. Sir, I have sold off my property. Sold off shares. I borrowed money from the market, sir. What will I do, sir? What will I do? Don't talk like a child! My money is also involved! It was not just yours alone! Go, get a drink! You'll be all right. Do you suspect either of Shardul and Prakash? Why would Shardul do this? He already has so much money. And Prakash? He can't kill even a rat! Then only the two of us remain. Maybe somebody on the train found out. . . .that Shiva was carrying such a big amount. Maybe he stole it. Impossible. Impossible. Shiva is too strong a person. If somebody had tried it. . . .then his dead body would have been found in Shiva's place. And that police friend of yours? Kalyan? He too knew about this deal. Don't talk like an idiot! The money was going to be delivered to him only! Why would he need to do all this on the train? Sir, your drink? Yes, get it. Sir! Sir, whoever he is, will not escape from you. You can make out on seeing the face. What's the matter, sir? Even his face is not recognisable! Whose? Shiva's. It has been totally crushed! Vicky. . 4 years ago, I had seen Shiva fighting with 4 athletic men. He was proving to be more than a match for all of them. Nobody can kill Shiva. If anybody can kill Shiva, then it is Shiva himself. What do you mean? Vicky, it seems that Shiva must have found. . . .a man of his size and build. After killing him, he must have thrown him on the railway tracks. Dressing him in his clothes, he must have put his identity card. . . .and all the contents of his pockets into his pockets. And he must have run away with the money. Sir, but why would Shiva do that? His mother is in hospital. Sir, he can't leave her and go. Where are the two of you? I have been waiting since long! Yes, come fast. Sir, Shiva's mother is in hospital. He cannot leave her and go. In the hospital there is his girlfriend Vaijanti also. It is possible that she might have helped him in this. Sir, but I don't think Shiva can do this. I mean I had met him 3 days ago. He is going to open a garage at Charkop. . He had shown me the place also. Stop talking nonsense! Go to the hospital immediately. Keep a watch over there. Vaijanti might slip out with mother. Sir, I am going. But I don't believe it, sir. That day you had gone to drop him at the station. Did you suspect from his talk. . . .that he will do something like this with us? I didn't feel anything different. - Ok. But he sneezed when he was entering the compartment. My wife used to say that if somebody sneezes. . . .when you set out for some work. . . .then that work cannot be accomplished. I don't believe in these things, but our task did remain unaccomplished. Don't worry; I won't leave him. I won't spare him. Vicky, who told you that I had gone to the station to drop Shiva? Sir you only had told me. No; I did not tell you. Sir, you only told me. . . .otherwise how would I have known? Yesterday, when I talked to you on the phone. . . .even then I had not told you. Today you are with me. I have never mentioned it. Sir, you are forgetting, you only told me. Sir, I will make a drink. Vicky, sit down. Sit down. We will have a drink also. It was decided that Prakash will go to drop him at the station. He could not go, so I had to go all of a sudden. How did you find out that I had gone to the station? Sir, you only told me. Otherwise how would I have known? You have seen me at the station. Sir, you have a misconception. Sir I was not there. Did you send somebody to murder him. . . .or did you go personally? What are you saying, sir? You are suspecting me! Sir, I was not there. - Shut up, you scoundrel!! Tell me! Tell me the truth! Come on! It was an accident, sir! Sir, I tried to make him unconscious. He began to beat me. I pushed him. He fell down. His head crashed into the basin and he died. Sir, I thought, if I get the money. . . .I will take Minni and go away. Sir, I don't want anything. I don't want anything. Please help me! Please help me, sir! You have gone on a dark path, my son. Sir, I made a mistake. Please sir, I am really sorry. Let Prakash and Shardul come. Then we will think about what happens and what to do. You have done what you wanted to do. Sir please, I'm sorry! Sir, please! Please forgive me, sir! I had timed it with chloroform. I was unconscious for 1 1/2 hours. I had thought. . I had thought that Shiva also will. . Sir. . I haven't spent the money. Sir, it's the full amount. The money is in the car. Sir, the car is parked at the multiplex. 'I suggest we tie him on the same track and leave him there. ' 'In a few moments, he would be cut into pieces. ' "Where should I go? I don't know." "Somebody tell me." "Take my fair complexion." "Give me dark complexion." "I will hide in the twilight." "Give me my beloved's company." "The moon peeps from the cloud." "May you be eclipsed." "It smiles making me feel envious." "Take my fair complexion." "Give me dark complexion." "I will hide in the twilight." "Give me my beloved's company." "Coyness pulls one hand." "Love the other." 'Pick up the phone, Seshu!' 'Hey, stop!' 'Come here!' 'Come! Come here!' 'Enough, Seshu! Dr. No is running at the Regal.' 'Weren't you going to take me to watch it?' 'Come on get up!' 'Dr. Yes is sitting in your house.' 'Do you want to leave him and go to Regal?' 'Silly!' What happened? Why are you guys standing outside? Where is Mr. Seshadri? From where are you coming? Goa! Yesterday he had called. He was saying there is some problem. He called me back quickly. What happened? Shiva is dead! - What? And our money too has vanished! Sir! What happened, sir? Sir! What are you looking? Sir! - Sir! Sir! Sir! - Mr. Seshadri! Sir! Hello. Kalyan! Yes! Mr. Kalyan! This is Shardul speaking. Yes! He is here! - Say later! I will call you after 10 minutes. Yes. . I will call you within 10 minutes. Yes! Okay! At 4:40 Mr. Seshadri had called from this number. And at around 5 o'clock we were pushing the door. Let's call the police! Are you mad? Let's call the police! Shardul! Sir. . whoever has killed you. . we won't spare him. Mr. Seshadri's watch. It's working. You keep it. He respected you a lot. You keep it. He respected you a lot. "Escaping! Escaping! Escaping! Escaping!". . . ."Escaping! Escaping! Escaping! Escaping!" "Where will you escape?" "Where will you escape?" "From these eyes, these charms." "Where will you escape?" "Where will you escape?" "Where will you escape?" "Where will you escape?" "From these eyes, these charms." "Where will you escape?" "Where will you escape?" Do you know what kind of work we do? Yes, sir! A bit. - Still you want to join us? Have a seat. The beginning is always with helplessness. Helplessness gradually becomes need. And then need becomes habit. You are an educated guy. You are young. Why don't you do some other kind of work? I want to work with you, sir! - Quick money. You want to become rich fast! Fine, dear. If this is what you are destined for. . then welcome. Thank you, sir! Lovely watch, sir! It must be very expensive! My wife had presented me this watch. '72! I used to smuggle watches. And my wife saved money from her salary. . . .and got this watch for me. Now till the time this watch is with me. . . .I feel she too is near me. The person who killed Seshadri. . he is in this room. You! You! You! Or me! Why not? Besides you people only I knew that Shiva. . . . is coming by train carrying 2.5 crores. Within 2 days I will find out the murderer. Till then you guys behave normally. As if nothing has happened. Otherwise. . suspicion will arise. Seshadri was my friend. Only 2 days. Within 2 days I will find out everything about this Kalyan! It's possible that he stole the money. Then why would he come here? Buddy. . - He too must be in a hurry to sell his goods. Your friend had arranged for the ticket! - So? Did you tell him anything? Shardul! What is written here? Fool!

Sir. . Shiva didn't call. Aunt talks nonsense. He had gone to Kolkata last year. She is telling you about that. Alzheimer is in advanced stage.

When you had gone to Goa. . Yes, I remember. I mortgaged my wife's parlour. . . .withdrew all my bank balance. . . .still I was short of 8 lakh rupees. Now, I was not going to request to Shardul. I called my friend Mukariya, he prints fake notes. I took 8 lakh rupees from him and mixed it in the 2 1/2 crores. Saying that when the deal is done. . . .I will say sorry to Seshadri sir and adjust it. But, the money was stolen. It was stolen.

Why are you taking tension, I will shoot him. Don't be afraid, let that scoundrel Shardul come. If I knew all this is going to happen. . . .then I would have never done it. Who knew it? Did you know it? Did I know it? Did Shiva know it? Shardul is a serpent. Shiva's death was an accident. It was not an accident it is all Shardul's doing. Why don't you listen to me? I didn't want to kill Shiva. Seshadri sir found out everything. Why did you take me to Shardul? Varsha? - Where is Prakash? What happened? - Prakash has still not come home. I don't know where he has gone since afternoon. His phone is switched off too. He was at home in the morning. Then he came home at 4 o'clock. Without saying anything, he took the pistol and left. He was saying that Shardul has stolen the money. Shardul has stolen the money! I have already called Shardul, he says I don't know anything. He just met Prakash once in the morning. . . .I don't know anything else. I am very scared Vikram. Today morning we had a very big argument. Don't worry Varsha. You had an argument with him. . . . he must be sitting in some bar, to make you worry. He could have called, he knows that I will be fine. . . . if he calls once. He could have called you, you are his friend. He is mad, doesn't understand anything. Come on, I will drop you home. Pakya will return by morning. Pull it up. Still up. Still up. Keep it going. Prakash. Shardul did all this? He also killed Shiva and Seshadri. You will not spare him. I will. I will control myself. But whenever I think about Chickoo. . . .when I will go home, he will ask. Where is papa, what will I tell him. Prakash, papa has left us. Now only me and you are left Shardul-bhai. Then what? Look at me, you mean to say that I killed him. I am not saying that. Then what are you saying? Then who can it be? - How would I know? If I find out, then. . I don't want this, I don't want all this. I am feeling very strange! He is not there, I am feeling very strange. Who is doing all this? Who is it? Apply the brake. Bring some water. Das Auto Works. Pune. "As the moonlight touches." "A spark turns into flames."

You don't have time, tell me now you scoundrel. . . .tell me now! Shardul-bhai, won't you believe me? I didn't want to kill anyone? - Then, what should I do? Forgive you, let you go, spare you! How did Seshadri find out, tell me? Tell me! These questions will trouble you all your life. Vikram! He knows everything about us. Are you fine? Now what shall we do? We don't have any way?

I loved you, he was about to kill you. . . .everything, I will tell them the entire truth! We don't have any other choice. Yes, we can do one more thing. Before anyone sees us, we can runaway from here. Vikram, do you understand what I am saying. . . .Vikram are you listening what I am saying, Vikram. . Minni calm down. Other than us, no one knows that Shardul had come back here. I will get rid of Sharduls corpse. . . .so that when the police find it, it doesn't have. . . .any connection with us. The police should believe that when Shardul was killed. . . .at that time, both of us were right here, in the club. I don't understand what you are saying? First of all, you will go out of here. . . .and after exactly five minutes come in the club. . . .through the main entrance. - But. . You will find Lawrence there.

Shall I send coffee? No thanks, no coffee, no tea I don't want anything. Now what? We cannot leave Shardul's car here. We will have to get rid of the car and the corpse. What are you doing? Even if anyone sees me, they will think that Shardul is driving. I will take 2-3 taxis and return. Until I don't return, under no circumstances. . . .will you open the front door. Everyone should feel, that I am here with you. If I am late Minni, don't be scared. . . .everything will be fine now. Wait for me. I met such customers. Good that I killed him. I killed him.
