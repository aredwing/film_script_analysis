'She was the longest, tallest, most luxurious ship in all creation.' - I'm sailing. - Yes, well, so am I, as it happens. So much for the smoking room and the palm court. The electronic lifts are behind the staircase and forward of that there are some 30-odd cabins. This goes to the boat deck. - Are we going back to the bridge? - No, they won't want anyone under foot. Come on. Excuse me. Thank you. Look, it's almost sailing time. - Such a beautiful clock. - Thank you. I chose it myself. It's meant to be Honour and Glory crowning Time. - They ought to be crowning you, lsmay. - Hello. Never mind, every sort of honour and glory will come your way after today. We thought the Olympic was the last word. - This is the summit. - Congratulations. Too kind. - Who's that? - A countryman of yours. - John Jacob Astor and his bride. - His child bride. Half the millionaires in America are on this crossing. Aha! The man of the hour himself! - Hail to thee, O chief designer! - How are you, Bruce? Julia? I've been taking bows for your handiwork all morning. I can't seem to convince anyone that you built it, so I've stopped trying. - What are you togged out for? - Still working? Just tightening up the odd bolt here and there. Tommy, you've got an army of helpers for that. If I do it myself, I've no one but me to blame if it's not done properly. Own up, you're a perfectionist. A hard case. All ashore that's going ashore! All ashore that's going ashore! You two, come and be immortalised. Is it true this is your last voyage, Captain? And er... you're going out in a blaze of glory, as it were? Not quite, though I do see retirement in my immediate future. I'm looking forward to a long, tranquil time in dry dock before they finally sell me for scrap, as it were. Now, how is this? Keep coming. Keep coming. Smile, darling. Walk right on past me. That's it. - Tugs are all fast, sir. - Good. Mr Bowyer, we're in your expert hands until we reach the Nab. May we have your orders? We have a rendezvous this evening in France. Thank you, sir. - Let go your stern ropes. - Let go the stern ropes. Aft tug away, sir. - Slow ahead. - Slow ahead. Slow ahead it is, sir. Gentlemen, we're under way. Since there was no formal launching, I should just like to say God bless this ship and all who sail in her. Like it? I'm sorry, madam, I had no business... No, no, it suits you. Let's see. It's a very good colour for you. You're bigger here than I am. You'll want to have it let out a little. - I will? - It's yours when we reach New York. Oh, no, madam, I couldn't possibly. You like it, don't you? It's the most beautiful dress I've ever seen. Then it's settled. Oh, no, but I... I can't. - Did you find everything you need? - Yes. There's no bidet in the bathroom, of course, but then it's a British ship. One mustn't expect miracles. Mrs Astor likes her comfort, huh? I'm awfully spoilt, aren't I, for the rather ordinary daughter of a man from Brooklyn. You were never ordinary. I don't care who your father is. And you're not half as spoilt as you're going to be when I'm through with you. Did you spoil Ava when you were first married? Nobody spoils Ava, she's the one that spoils things. Everything. I got used to her insulting me, calling me stupid and clumsy. I never got used to her cruelty to Vincent. At the time he was no bigger than that. Shaming him in front of her guests. He's about the same age as you are now. I don't suppose he's ever had a kind word from her. Everywhere he goes, people say, "Ah, your mother, the greatest beauty of the age." He just looks at them. I'm not beautiful. Yes, you are. Not like her. But I can be kind. I can be infinitely kind. What do you think of it? I don't know what to think. It gives me the shivers. Big is one thing, but that. It'll seem small enough when we're a thousand miles from land and nothing but the great ocean all around. You've been to sea before, then? I haven't. Me neither. Mr Astor. Will you look this way, Mrs Astor? Smile, please. How do you and your bride feel to be aboard the Titanic? No more. Louise-Kate, I didn't know you were on board. May I introduce my wife? - Friends of Ava's? - Yes. - Doesn't matter. - Of course it matters. Maggie! Maggie! Maggie! I beg your pardon. Are you addressing me? How's it gonna look when I make my legitimate stage debut? Maggie Brown? Oh, I'm sorry. Molly. Molly! - I keep forgetting. - So do I. - Hello, Emma. Are you dining with us? - Try and stop us. - Come along, please. - We'll get you sorted out. This alleyway's something. The officers named it Park Lane after the poshest street in London. The crew calls it Scotland Road. If you've never been to Liverpool, it's very disreputable. - My cabin's already full up. - Come on, join the parade. You've got to expect little mishaps on a brand-new ship. - I'm sorry. Mary Agatha, is it? - Bridget. Bridget Bradley. - I'm Mary Agatha. - I'll get it. - The pair of you's the problem. - She's Kate and I'm Katie. Shocking business, putting four of us in a space this small. - Small, is it? Seems massive to me. - Go on! She means it. She's one of ten kids. And two rooms in the house. We was three and four to a bed. - Mercy, what's that? - An explosion. Not to worry, they've just started the engines. You're near the casing. - Are we moving? - We will be soon. I'm going to be seasick, I know. Well, think that way and you will. Is it "Abandon ship" or "Run for your life"? - It's lunch. - Da-da-da! Da-da-da! Do you do that every time it's lunch? And breakfast and dinner. Third-class dining saloon, one deck down. Dinner? They call tea dinner? What swank. I never had dinner in my life. We're on our way to ruin, the bunch of us. Good. - Daniel, my stomach's growling. - Almost finished. Be careful. Watch out. - Oh! - Oh, I'm sorry. No harm done. - Watch out. - This reel is nearly used up. That's quite an expensive toy. - It was a wedding present. My dad's in moving pictures. Tell him to save his money and invest in something with a future like Vaudeville. Henry's a theatrical producer. Broadway. - Henry Harris. How are you? - Dan Marvin. This is Mary. I'm Renee. Do you think the movies are a flash in the pan? Well, my father used to say sinking cash into novelties was like waiting for ships that never come in. - Sinking ships? Was that funny? - Only by accident. Enough about accidents. Let's eat. Oh, sorry. It's all right, Miss Sloan. It's only me. Mr Andrews? Yes, the Astors have gone to lunch. I just nipped in to give a prod to that fan you reported out of order. Were you taking a last look at Ireland? Yes, yes. Isn't it foolish? We're hardly away and I'm homesick. Where do you come from? Comber, County Down, but I live in Belfast now. - So do I. - Do you? Where? Kerslan Road, Strandtown. Yes. My wife and I used to stroll in Victoria Park when we were courting. - Do you have any children? - One. A little girl, Elizabeth. She cried when we said goodbye. If you ever want to talk about home, just come along to the linen room. We could give you a cup of tea. Thank you, I'd like that. - Good evening. - Good evening. She dines late. Well, she's a countess. When you're a countess you dine when you like. I'm sorry, darling. - Countess of what, Maggie? - Rothes. Thank you, Cyril. Don't call me Maggie. I find her fascinating. She looks just the way I've always wanted to. Worldly and mysterious. I wouldn't change you for any countess. Talk about mysterious... take a squint down there in the corner. What is that gay dog Ben Guggenheim doing at a table all by himself for two? Well, the story... The story is he finally broke it off with her nibs, the Marquise de Cerruti, and now he's on his way home to his kids for the first time in seven or eight months. - What's wrong? - Oh, nothing. He's such an attractive man. He can leave his patent leathers outside my door any night. - Maggie! - Molly, darn it, Emma! Scandalous. This conversation's a little spicy for me, ladies, if you'll excuse me. I'm going to the smoke room to have a very, very mild cigar. Well, now we can let our hair down. Did I really bother JJ with my nonsense? No, you're good for him. You make him laugh. - He's suffered so much on my account. - Oh, no. No, it's true. That's why I frowned when you mentioned Mr Guggenheim. John still hasn't got over the insults after his divorce. And worse after we were married. Because he loved me he thought his friends would accept me. His friends do. As for the others, to hell with them. He can't say that. It's desperately important to him. - It's his life. - Cheer up. Everything will look much better after the baby's born. You've got so much happiness in store for you. Jimmy! Jimmy! - Thanks very much. - Your health, Jimmy. - Slainte. - Up the Irish. This is fierce. No different to what it was back home. I know, girls on one side, boys on the other and never the twain shall meet. We're all the time having dances and we don't know how to dance. I don't and I'm jiggered if I'll apologise for it. Damn silly business in my view. I can dance. Can you, Martin? I can so, only I haven't seen the girl yet. - What girl is that? - The girl I'll be after dancing with. Good luck, old son. It looks a pretty narrow field from here. Sit down, you eejit. Hold that, will you? Don't be doing that. Stop it, do you hear? Hello? Hello? We will be closing in five minutes' time, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Turn off your light, Mr Moon Man Go and hide your face behind a cloud Can't you see that couples want to spoon, man? Two is company and three's a crowd I'll take my lady to a shady place where I can hug my lady And we'll say to you, moonlight... Oh-oh! Oh, Emma, to be 17 again! Or even 39. I don't think there's a worse place to be on your own than a big romantic ship like this, unless it's Niagara Falls. You just know there's so much love going on. You lie there in the dark and watch the shadows moving past that crack of light under your cabin door. Footsteps coming close, footsteps going away. A soft knock on a door and a soft voice answers. A door closes. You wonder if you're the only one sleeping one to a bed tonight. - Maggie, you shock me. - I'll brain you if you don't stop. - Sit up straight. - Was I slouching? - No, you're blocking my view. - View of what? There's a bozo sitting behind... Don't look now, he's glancing this way. Like he's getting up courage to ask me if my programme's full up for the evening. Not exactly love's young dream, but he wouldn't turn your stomach. - Maggie. - Molly! Molly... you surely wouldn't dance with a perfect stranger. Certainly not. Emma Bucknell, what in the world are you thinking of? Ol! "Saw another ice field and two icebergs latitude 45' 20", longitude 49'." Jack? Jack, are you awake? This has got to go straight up to the bridge. What do you find to read in that rather primitive library? I beg your pardon? They only have what the library steward calls "light ship-board reading". "Stover At Yale", "Hopalong Cassidy". I wondered how you found anything so engrossing. I'm just catching up with Fischer's work on proteins. - Rather dull stuff, I'm afraid. - You're a scientist? Nothing so colourful. I teach. I'm a science master at Dulwich College. Not college in the American sense. It's a boys' school. What a coincidence. I'm a teacher too. At a girls' school in the States. That is a coincidence. Yes. I'm rather bored with this. Would you care for a stroll? That would be nice. I'm on my way... Please go on... You first. I was going to say I'm on my way to the States for my first visit. Leave of absence. I made a tour of India with teachers from all over the world. Now I'm on my way home. I'm on leave too. Another coincidence. This is a funny place to be, isn't it? - We're the middle. - The middle? The middle class. Haven't you noticed? This ship is a microcosm of the British social system. A maze of barriers erected to keep them from getting here and to keep us from getting there. But it's not social, it's purely economic. Any rich upstart can get his pick of accommodation up there and any nobleman short of funds might find himself travelling down there. So in a sense the thing is constructed on the American principle of equal opportunity based on the ability to pay. I don't see any dukes or earls milling about. Do you? - Well, not wearing a coronet. Look at that chap there. - I've evolved a theory about him. - Go on. Well, he's been a failure in one way or other at home and his family has packed him off with the proverbial shilling and a one-way-ticket to America. - How romantic you are. - Am I? I think so. Making up stories about people. You could ask a deck steward. They know everybody's business. I couldn't do that. Anyway, it helps pass the time. One has to do something. - I believe I'm parboiled. - Ten minutes more, dear. Be brave. Mrs Brown, your time is up, lovey. - Maude, you got an aspirin out there? - We'll see. Now, come along. Agh! I'm gonna take another half-hour, hon. - Whatever for? - For my sins. Every time we've been in here, those four have been in the same place. I believe this ship could tip over or run aground and not one of them would look up. Play cards. Cognac, please. - Can I buy you a drink, Guggenheim? - Why not? Two . Here. Try one of these. Something special from Havana. What a relief. I seldom know these days exactly who is still speaking to me and who isn't. Why wouldn't I be sympathetic? Our stories aren't so different. - A couple of middle-aged refugees. - Refugees? Fleeing from bad marriages, falling for younger women. - Condemned to wonder forever. - Wonder what? Do they really want us for ourselves, these golden girls, or is it just the name, the position, the money? Did I wake you? I er... hate getting old and having a paunch. What about mine? I love that. I love you. Do you love me? I... Is it possible you love me? Good night. Good night. If I had a chaperone and a suite with a sitting room, I'd invite you in for a chat. As it is, I'm sharing a cabin about this big with a total stranger. So am I. - We'll see each other tomorrow. - I expect we will, yes. Well, it's inevitable. See you at breakfast? - I say, I don't know your name. - It's Leigh. - Miss Leigh or... - Miss Goodwin. Leigh Goodwin. I'm Lawrence Beesley. - I know. - How? I asked a steward. I told you they know everybody's business. Thank you very much. Would you care for a go? I'm not allowed. - Who was that? - The lift boy. - The lift boy? - I mean he runs the elevator. I think he'd much rather be out here playing games, but he can't. Thank you. - It isn't fair. - What? For anyone to be that beautiful. If you were to stand down there, there's a barrier between second and steerage. You could talk to her when she came round. No. You couldn't do that. I'm sorry. All the arrogance of class isn't at the very top, you see. It's none of my business in any case. I was talking out of turn. I honestly am sorry. - How's the patient? - Expiring. Ah, and what time's the rosary? Blackguards. - We missed you at lunch. - We brought you fruit. Don't, David. Don't ever say food to me again as long as I live. Kate, fetch the chamber. No, you've nothing on your stomach. It's a great pity to be lying there, and you the grandest dancer from Ballymahon to Drumlish. Oh, they say there's bread and work for all And the sun shines always there But I'll not forget old Ireland... Is it true what the song says, Oli, that there's bread and work for all? For all who is willing to work hard. Ja, I say so. What you find naturally depends what you're looking for. - A bit of money. - Amen to that. - And you, Martin? - What? Give over, will you? There's not a sorrier sight than a man that's gone spoons over a girl he's never spoken to. - Leave it alone, Farrell. - No, hear me out. I'm your friend, even if I've only known you a few days. What I say, it's clear to everyone but you, that the lady will never honour us with her presence again, having stuck her pretty nose in the one time only, and you'll be far better off if you... You were saying, James? Go in peace, my son. In your hour of rapture don't forget tomorrow's the first Sunday after Easter. This is he that came by the water and blood, Jesus Christ. Not by water only, but by water and blood. Let us sing "Eternal Father, Strong To Save". Eternal Father, strong to save Whose arm doth bind the restless wave Who bidd'st the mighty ocean deep Its own appointed limits keep O hear us when we cry to thee For those in peril on the sea - What's all this in aid of? - Slumming, do you suppose? Steward? The captain always inspects the ship top to bottom every Sunday. It's tradition. Is it the custom to have a lifeboat drill on Sunday? - Yes. - Will there be one today? I haven't heard. Isn't it rather important that everyone should know which boat is assigned to where it is? Normally I'd say yes, very important, but when you're talking about the Titanic, she's a huge lifeboat herself, ain't she? That's put me in my place. - Good morning. - Good morning. Another perfect day. You could scarcely ask for a smoother sea. We've had a good few of those from various sources. How far away is this? Not far. Chances are we'll be well into it by midnight. Do you plan to alter speed or course? I never have in the past. The position is the same with every large ship sailing this route. So long as the weather's clear, full speed ahead. Put the danger behind you rapidly. I've lived by that and never encountered difficulties. Had you anything in mind different for the Titanic? Certainly not. The company have always had utmost confidence in your judgment. We'd be sorry not to arrive on schedule. Please carry on as if I weren't even on board. It's about time. Thank you, Alfie. Have you filled out a declaration form for the American customs? No, not yet. New York still seems such a long way off. Well, might as well be early as late. The way they're pouring on the steam, chances are we'll dock on Tuesday, late Tuesday rather than Wednesday morning. Tonight seems likely to be our last night but one. Good heavens. Dinner! No reaction. They must have their meals sent in. - Are we dressing again? - Of course. Every night except the first and the last. Mesaba to Titanic. Ice report in latitude... Heavy packed ice, large icebergs also. Field ice. Weather good. Clear. Damned if I'm running up to the bridge again. More of the same. Sorry, polishing the old ivories. What did you say? Nothing. - It's a raw night. - Perishing cold. Temperature's dropped four degrees. - Not much wind. - No, flat calm. Aye, seems clear enough. Perfectly clear. - Captain in his cabin, is he? - Yes. - We're doing just over 22 knots. - Not bad for a 21-knot ship. He said if it becomes hazy we must slow down. I understand. He's to be woken up if there's any change. - Right you are. - I'll leave you to it, then. - Good night. - Good night. Right, you lot, out you come. - What's the word? - Keep a lookout for small ice. - Have you seen any? - No. But it's out there. I can smell it. Have fun, chaps. Anything wrong? I can't concentrate. I keep thinking how near the end we are. Oughtn't we be doing something special tonight? - Like what? - I don't know. There's a concert in the lounge, I believe. Yes, I saw the announcement. "The Flight Of The Bumblebee" and other favourites on piano and violin. - Would you care to go? - Would you? - Not really. - Neither would I. - It's probably over by now anyway. - Very likely. What else is there? A turn on the deck? Why not? In first class we might have gone dancing. Yes. On the way over some of the more daring folk in second sneaked up and had quite a gay time of it. - You didn't go? - No, I was afraid of being caught. I should be too. - We're both cautious. - Yes. A turn on the deck won't be much to look back on, will it? Why not? It's a beautiful night. I don't think I've ever seen so many stars all at one time. Amazing, isn't it? So bright up there, so dark below. The sea doesn't reflect the stars, have you noticed? It's like a big black void, bottomless. I think this is much nicer than dancing or listening to "The Flight Of The Bumblebee". You're wrong to say that tonight won't be anything to look back on. I'm sure I'll remember it for a long time. - Will you? - Yes. It was awfully lucky for me that we met. - That I was so forward? - Yes, there you are. If you hadn't been, I'd never have spoken for fear you'd think me a masher. I could never do that. It's obvious what sort of a man you are. When you left the deck this afternoon, the woman next to me said, "Your husband is a perfect gentleman." - "Your husband"? - Isn't it silly? Our spending so much time together has aroused a lot of interest. My cabin steward, for one. Did he say something? Yes. He's a very friendly sort of chap. I expect he meant well. He said... "it must be hard with so many people around to find a place to be alone." And? That was all. Doesn't sound as if it were. It had the ring of an unfinished thought. He said something I couldn't repeat. - I'll think it's something awful. - It is awful. Go on. He said... We were talking just outside my door... He said, "There's an empty cabin at the far end of the corridor." I see. Did he give you a key? There is no key, it's unlocked. Do you want me to go there with you? I expect I do, yes. Oh, you expect but you're not certain. You haven't weighed every possible consequence. I scarcely dared think about it. Then how can you be sure it's what you really want? Not just what you think I might expect from you, the friendly thing to do. Because we are friends, or at least good companions. Of course. But we're not in love, are we? Well? Are we? No, I don't expect we are. Of course not. Either way, I'm told the same rule applies. Shipboard friendship and romances end with the voyage. It's considered bad form to pursue it further. - You sound as if you're saying goodbye. - No. Just practising. I will say good night, though, if you don't mind. I'm feeling the cold finally. - I'm sorry. I'll see you to your door. - No, don't. Stay. Have your walk. - I'm all right. - Please. Please. Forget what I said. It was clumsy and foolish. - I don't know what possessed me. - I think I do. I think it was just a desire to be kind. I'm not offended. A little shocked, but not offended. I suppose I ought to be grateful and I am in a way, it's just that... Forgive me but I'm waiting for a better offer. So you should. Thank you. You're a very special man. I'll never forget you. Good night. - You're sure I can't... - Good night. I'm too old to be cavorting around a dance floor with a girl half my age. Especially when the girl is a bit pregnant. Especially then. I really shouldn't ask you. No, you shouldn't, but I'd never forgive you if you didn't. Everyone on the dance floor is on his honeymoon. And like us they can't believe it's over. - We still have tomorrow. - I don't want it ever to end. I want to go on sailing and dancing and loving for ever and ever. Christ! What did you see? - 'Iceberg right ahead.' - Thank you. Iceberg right ahead! Hard to starboard. We've had it. Did you feel something? - I did, a slight bump. - A bump in mid-ocean? - Why have we stopped? - I don't know. I don't suppose it's anything much. - How did you ever get down there? - You tell me. Mr Barrett! Where's the man got to? Barrett, get some men down there to help draw the fires. Aye aye, sir. Just how serious is it? We're listing five points to starboard. Oh, my God. What are you doing about it? I'm waiting for a report from Mr Andrews and the Chief Engineer as to the exact extent of the damage. Fire down below! Fire down below! You want to get blown to kingdom come? I don't want you back here till these boilers are out! Is it hopeless, then? It appears that the unthinkable has happened. The ship is designed to stay afloat with any three of its first five compartments flooded. She would even float if all five were gone, torn away, but under no circumstances can she remain afloat with those five compartments flooded. The weight of the flooding must inevitably bring her down at the head. Every sort of potential damage was considered in the planning. But who could have anticipated a collision that would leave a gash close to 300 feet long in her side? - The pumps will help, of course. - Temporarily. How much time do you give us? At a rough guess, one hour, possibly two. Gentlemen. I must say something to you now, which is the nightmare of every master and which, in 32 years of service to this company, I never expected to have to say. We must prepare to abandon ship. - What is that? - Steam. Can't you stop it? We have to let off steam to avoid an explosion. Mr Boxhall, tell the wireless operator to send out the distress signal. - He must be given our position. - Sir. There must not be any panic. Well, get on with it. Good night, ladies Good night, ladies I'm going to leave you now Merrily we roll along Roll along, roll along Merrily we roll along O'er the deep blue... Blimey. - Officer? - Who's that? - Cottam. - What's the problem? - I've had an urgent message. - At this hour? - It's the Titanic. - Titanic? She's sinking. Sinking? Impossible, she's unsinkable. The message is to come at once. Sir? - Who's that with you? - Cottam, sir. - Cottam? - Wireless operator. - Oh, yes. - Urgent message from the Titanic. The Titanic? - Well, what is it? - It's a CQD, sir. CQ... Are you sure? Yes, sir. They used the new distress signal as well. SOS. She struck an iceberg. She's 58 miles away. Our course is north 52 west. Get back to your man on the Titanic, tell him we're coming and we should be there in four hours' time. Four hours? Johnson, give Mr Lightoller a hand. You, help me over here. Get started on number three. Sir, a ship has been sighted half a point on the port bow. A light that might be a ship. - Permission to break out the rockets. - Use your Morse lamp. The Carpathia is on her way but she's 50 miles away. - Tell her to come quickly. - Aye aye, sir. - Did you get through? - I said within four hours. What was his reply? He said, "Please hurry. Engine room flooded. We're sinking head down." - Take that! - Come here! Stop it! Stop it! - Jimmy! - This is rare sport. If you have anything in the cabin you value, come quickly. There's water on the floor and it's rising. All passengers on deck with their lifebelts on. All passengers on deck. - What happened? - No cause for alarm. There's been a mishap and we're taking precautions. Go back to bed. Oh, do go back to bed. That's right. There's nothing whatever to worry about. Nothing at all. Go back to bed. The order is for everyone to get into their lifebelts. - First I've heard of it. - Now you know. - Then take them to the boat deck? - No, it's first and second class there. They won't stay in the cabins with their belts on. Look at that, will you? Mother's picture. - There's no lifebelts under here. - None up here either. We've been fiddled. You see, darling. That is what makes it float. Do you think you ought to be doing that, Johnny? - Why not? - Perhaps you'll need it. I'm sure they have more than enough. There were half a dozen in our suite. It's nonsense for us to be in these things anyway. This ship is unsinkable. All I say is, tell us what's expected of us and we'll do it. It's this not knowing that makes everybody so edgy. Look who's here! Good business, Wally. Miss Goodwin. Mr Hesketh! Are all the fires out in six? What about five? - Flooded. Covered with water. - Let's get going, then. Let's take the elevator. It's only one flight. - Something's funny. - What? - The steps. - They make you lean forward. They're tilted toward the front of the ship. - What would cause that? - Search me. I didn't know it was a party. No lifebelt, Miss Sloan? It seemed a bit mean to wear one. Apparently they're in short supply. Don't be a fool. Find one and put it on. Yes, sir. Oh, and what about you? The boats are ready. Shall we get the women and children away? Without any delay. The assignment list is no good to us now. It's too late. Just do the best you can as quickly as possible. Please, we're trying to fill this boat. We can't do that without your... ...cooperation. - What means that? - It means the fires are all out. It means the boilers are cold. We're not moving. You'll be just as well off in this boat. My jewels! Don't be a damn fool, honey. They won't be any use if this thing sinks. - Now go ahead. Do as the man says. - Come on, love. We won't drop you. You too. Hold on a minute, I just thought I'd stick around and watch the fun. My friend! Down here, Emma, jump in. It's all right. I'll get the next one, Maggie. Molly! It's Molly! Can't you ever get it right? Lower away. Women and children only. I can't force the women in, can I? I can't hit them if they don't want to go. Ladies, this way, please. This way. What's going on? I'll put a stop to that. Right, lower away. Lower away. Lower away. Lower away. Don't take all night. Lower away! Put some life into it! - Get out of here and it will go fine. - I only wanted to help. You want it faster? You'll have me drown the lot of them. Who the bloody hell are you, giving orders? Now, look here. I'm... Do you know who I am? I-I-I'm... I'm a passenger. Then get back there and leave the crew to do their job. Sorry. Don't look so worried. They'll keep you out there until everything's shipshape, then they'll bring you back on board. Er... look here... my wife is expecting. May I get in just long enough... I wouldn't advise it. The Chief Officer is rather tetchy. - He's given us pistols just in case. - I wouldn't want to get shot. Please be extra careful with this lady. - Johnny... - Soon, darling. Soon. Lower away. We'll be together soon, darling. Now, listen, everybody. Pay attention, please. Listen! I've been authorised to lead you all out in small groups to where the lifeboats are. Now, the rule is women and children first, of course. That'll take from Jericho to June. Come on, we'll have our own small group. Come on. Ladies, come this way. Nobody come down. Men, stay back. Women and children only. I say, Mary Agatha, may I have this dance? No two ways about it, this is the best shipwreck I've ever been to. Funny, is it? You'll be waltzing with sharks if we can't get up there. Now, come on. What's your answer to that, Oli, with them powerful mitts of yours? Well said. - Kate! - Will you look at that, now! Did you ever! Real silver! Real linen! If what they say about the States is true, we'll all live like this. Come on, will you? What's this? How did you lot get here? I see. That's your game, is it? It'll go hard with the lot of you if anything is missing from this room. Furthermore, every first-class state room has been carefully locked in case you get any ideas. We'll have no looting aboard this ship. Looting, is it? We don't know anything about looting. We were looking. - For the lifeboats. - Do you go through here? Where I go doesn't come into it. You go back the way you came. Quick! You're not meant to be in here. For God's sake, mister, let the women through at least. All right. Women only, though. - Danny, please. - It's all right. I love you. - You go ahead, Ellen. - Mr Straus said... - Don't worry, I'll explain to him. - He won't like it. He's put up with me for 4O years. What can he do to me now? Don't be angry. And please don't argue, my mind's made up. I'm going to stay with you for a little. How long is a little? We'll see. We'll see. Right, lower away. Murdoch. How many boats left over here? - Two, sir. - Two? Make sure they're filled to absolute capacity. Sir. Let the children through. Hurry. We don't want another half-empty boat. Any more women? Any more women? Please! Ladies, this is the last boat but one. You can't afford to pick and choose. Hey! Any women behind you? - No. - Come on, there's a space here. Jump! Jump! Come on! - Give me your hand. - Thank you. - You all right? - Yes, thanks. Thanks very much. Cut that bloody rope. We're trapped. Stop lowering 15. Stop lowering 15! Bloody rope. We're trapped. Stop lowering! All right, come along. Steady. Someone pull that boat in. Step over there. Mind your skirt. Well done. You'll be fine, dear. All right. Next. Next. Give me your hand. That's it. Come along, dear. Come along. Steady. Steady as you go. For heaven's sake. Daniel! Here, cover yourself with this. Now, keep back. That's right. Hang on with the others. Good. Follow me. This is the way to the lifeboats. Come on! Mr Murdoch! Keep it moving! Now, stay back. Stay well back. Any man who tries to push his way in gets this for his bother. Any more women there? Are there no more women about? Come on if you're there. This may be your last chance. Lower away. Are there any ladies or children? Mr Andrews. All the boats are away now except for one or two of the collapsible kind. Better hurry. You must save yourself, you know. There'll be questions no one else can answer. Possibly. It's something to consider. Don't be too long. No. No, not too long. Off you go. - They ain't forgotten us, have they? - Us and a right few others. - God knows how many's trapped. - What we going to do? You a Catholic? Me neither. What's it matter now? Come on. - I'm forjumping. - I'm for sliding down. - You might hurt yourself. - You might get pulled under. We'll see who's right. See you in New York... maybe. Nice meeting you. It's locked. There's no way out here. Go back. Someone fell over the side. Martin! Don't look. Don't look. No more? Mind that oar there. Sorry. Come on. Grab the rope. - She's gone. God Almighty. We got to go back. We got to go back and help! The hell we will. They'd only tip us over. They'd pull us down. Give me the tiller. You take over an oar for a change. Look, I'm in charge here. Sit down and row. Sit down, damn you! - You're talking to a lady. - I know who she is. Coward. - We're here. - We've arrived, sir. Call out all hands. All boats readied and swung out. Open all gangway doors. A pilot ladder at each gangway and a chair sling for the wounded. Canvas bags for children. Aye aye, sir. Shall I go first? Come on, now. - Hold on! Just a few more steps. Come on, now. Good girl. What ship is this? - The Carpathia. - Carpathia? And the Titanic? Gone. - What time is it? - 2O minutes past two. - Three hours after the collision. - Slightly less than three. - With how many still aboard? - Hundreds. All the boats together wouldn't have held half of those aboard. Chances are more than a thousand went down. Another boat on the starboard bow, sir. And another beyond that. Ease away the winch. The steward will direct you to the dining saloon where there's food, drink and medicine. Give your name to this man. Mr lsmay of the White Star Line. I'm lsmay. And the Titanic was my ship. Mr lsma V? Sir? I'm Dr McGee, ship's surgeon. Won't you come inside now where it's warm? We can try to make you comfortable. Comfortable? What's the good of standing out here in the cold this way, sir? Look. Look. There's something in the water, just there. - I don't see anything, sir. - Look, it's there. - Use your eyes, why don't you? - It's only flotsam, sir. What I notice more than anything else is the silence. I suppose I expected sobbing or screaming or... I don't know. Everyone's so quiet. Perhaps it hasn't hit them yet. I know it hasn't hit me. Perhaps they're still hearing that sound. I know I'll never stop hearing it. And I keep looking for certain faces. - The sad librarian. - I know. I did so hope little Alfie might have come through. The lift boy. It was his first voyage. He loved the sea. Shall we ever be able to look at the world the same way? I'll never see it as safe and snug, if that's what you mean. None of us will. They never did, of course. For them it's always been perilous and unjust. Rumour has it that Mr lsmay's in shock and he said, "I have no right to be alive. Women and children are dead." You can't feel guilty to be alive. You didn't plough that ship full speed through an ice field you knew was there. Good afternoon, ladies. I'm Mrs Ogden. I'm just one of the passengers trying to do my bit. I've got hot coffee here and sandwiches. Oh, now, come on. You've got to have some nourishment after all. - You set them an example. - Please don't. Just give it to somebody else. Every one of these ladies has just lost her husband. I know that, son. I know how I'd feel in their place. And believe me, my heart goes out to all of you. But you have to go on living. You have to keep saying to yourself it was God's will. Come on. Coffee, eh? No coffee. No God either. God went down with the Titanic. All that strength and power and grace... A few chairs.
