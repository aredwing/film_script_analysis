( Woman humming) For instance, he gives 25 different interpretations of Genesis alone. Best in the market. Parsnip, turnip, everything for soup! Storybooks for women, sacred books for men! Lovely picture books for women. (Man)... in each sentence. Fish, fish! Fishy fish! (Child) Mama! (Boy) Rachel! Fish! Fish! Come, look. Look at this, ladies. Fine herring, beautiful silver carp. - (Woman) Delicious. - See the difference? The skin should be tight, firm, and the scales shiny like diamonds. - Yentl, how's Papa? - He's much better, thank you. Then there's the smell. (Man) Lovely picture books for women, sacred books for men. Storybooks for women, sacred books for men. Yentl? Yentl, what would you like to have? Erm... Yentl, a pike or a carp? - Fine. - A nice carp. Novels for women, sacred books for men. Yentl, what's this I hear? You finality got engaged. - I don't know. - What? Did you or didn't you? What, hear about it or do it? If she can joke about finding a husband at her age, I should worry. Here you are. So beautiful, it'll cook itself. (Chuckles) What's so funny? - Will you buy my fish? - I'll eat chicken. Storybooks for women, sacred books for men. Yentl, did you hear about Helen Shipman? - I haven't got time. - You never do. - Buy your gruel. - Sacred books for men. Lovely picture books for women. He relates the mysticism of creation to the mysticism of language. We shouldnt be reading these things. - Can we afford it? - No, but there's one in the rabbi's study. Come on. What a nice girl! There's your change. - You're in the wrong place, miss. - What? Books for women are over here. - Novels, very romantic. - I'd like this one. - Sacred books are for men. - Why? - It's a law. - Where is it written? Never mind where. It's a Law. Well, maybe it's written in here. Miss, do me a favour. Do yourself a favour. Ah, here, buy a nice picture book. - Girls Like picture books. - What if I told you it's for my father? Why didn't you say? 15 kopecks. - And that's written inside the cover. - Thank you. (Papa coughing) Good. And who's wise? - (David) He who knows a lot. - No, try again. - Who's wise? - (David) Erm... he who... - He who learns from all men. - (David) He who Learns from all men? Good. And who's rich? Oh, I know that one. (Yentl) He who is content with what he has. Yentl, is dinner ready? Yes, he who has a full heart and he who is content with what he has. (David) How can one question have two answers? Ah, David, sometimes there are many answers to the same question. Now, the last one. - Who is strong? - Erm... - Strong... - No, no. Who is strong? - He who controls his passions. - Concentrate. Controls his passions! - Try, David. - I'm trying. - He who... - He who controls his passions! Yentl knows Talmud? I think that's enough for today. My father says that a woman who studies Talmud is a demon. She's not a demon, she just has big ears. So you don't need to tell your father. - Goodbye, Reb Mendel. - Goodbye. Bye, David. Now the whole village will be talking about us. Papa, you shouldnt smoke. Do you think the angel of death will be frightened away by cough medicine? - First, you don't have to drown him in it. - Again. - Second, he's beginning to Like it. - You want some more? You know something? Baked apple is good a little burnt. - I'm sorry, Papa. - No. I Like it this way. - Really? - Oh, yes. Go on, your move. - Papa? - Mm? Why does every bookseller have the same argument? - You know why. - I envy them. - The booksellers? - No, the students! Talking about life, the universe. I learn how to tell a herring from a carp! Yentl, for the thousandth time, men and women have different obligations. - I know, but... - And don't ask why. Go on. Get the books. - Get the books. - Thank you, Papa. (Papa) "Thank you, Papa. Thank you, Papa. " - The shutters, darling. - The shutters. If you don't hide my studying from God, why from the neighbours? I trust God will understand. I'm not so sure about the neighbours. Questions, questions, even when you were Little. "Does a goat have a soul? What was before the universe?" - I'd Like to know. - Oy! - Where were we? - Hillel's argument. Erm... Hillels argument that knowledge... Papa? - Papa? - (Mumbles) Papa, I'm... I'm a Little tired tonight. Do you mind? We'll study tomorrow. Tomorrow. Oh, Yentl, Yentl. Oy. You're such a comfort to me. But you should have a young man to take care of you, one who doesn't Like to eat. - Good night. - Good night, Papa. (Coughing) - Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine. (Coughing quietly) (Papa coughing quietly) God, O merciful father, I am wrapped in a robe of light, clothed in your glory that spreads its wings over my soul. May I be worthy. Amen  There's not a morning I begin Without a thousand questions Running through my mind That I don't try to find the reason and the logic In the world that God designed The reason why A bird was given wings If not to fly And praise the sky With every song it sings What's right or wrong Where I belong Within the scheme of things...  (Papa coughing) And why have eyes that see and arms that reach Unless you're meant to know there's something more? If not to hunger for the meaning of it all Then tell me what a soul is for Why have the wings Unless you're meant to fly? And tell me, please, why have a mind If not to question why? And tell me where Where is it written what is it I'm meant to be That I can't dare To have the chance to pick the fruit of every tree Or have my share Of every sweet imagined possibility? Just tell me where Tell me where If I were only meant to tend the nest Then why does my imagination sail Across the mountains and the seas Beyond the make-believe of any fairy tale? Why have the thirst If not to drink the wine? And what a waste To have a taste Of things that can't be mine And tell me where Where is it written what it is I'm meant to be That I can't dare To find the meanings in the mornings that I see Or have my share Of every sweet imagined possibility?  Papa! Just tell me where Where is it written? Tell me where...  Are you all right? Or if it's written Anywhere...  (Woman) Did you hear? Yentl is learning Talmud! - It's true. - David's mother told me. She should Learn how to get a husband. (Coughing) He came all the way from Riga to see you. Why won't you at least meet him? - What for? - I want to dance at your wedding! - I want to see you happy. - I'm happy with you, Papa. I don't want to get married, to bear children and darn my husband's socks. You want a husband who will darn your socks and bear your children? Go on, turn the world upside down. You won't have a moment's peace. Children are more important than the Talmud. Without children to pass it on to, the Talmud dies with old men when they die. - I'm sorry. - I'm the one who's sorry. You're a woman but I didn't teach you how to be one. - You taught me everything I know. - Too much. You know too much, but not enough. - And it's my fault. - Papa, don't say that. Learning is my whole Life. Please don't be sorry. I'm not. - What is it? - That tree. That tree was this high when your brother Anshel died, may he rest in peace. You were only a baby, could hardily talk, let alone ask why. And now look, look how it's grown. Too late to tell you to play with dolls, huh? I love you, Papa. Hear me, O Lord, master of the universe. Thou hast given me a daughter who brings me great pride and pleasure. And for this kindness, I thank thee forever and ever. What's to become of you, Yentl? (Crows cawing) Come, Yentl. You must tear it over your heart. - Good. - (Rabbi) Who will say Kaddish? - I will. - It has to be a male relative. - (Reading in Hebrew) - (Mourners muttering) (Woman) May God forgive her. (Reading continues) (Mourners pray) My house is hers as long as she wants. She'll help in the store, look after the children, cook... - Yentl, eat. - (Woman muttering) It's enough. We mourn for seven days only. Then Life goes on. Ah! Sorry. Razel, Sarah, I think maybe we come back later. (Woman chatting quietly) (Woman) Get your things, Yentl. I'll come back for you Later. I'll keep you so busy, you won't have time to think. Forgive me, Papa. Wait! - Wait. Stop! - Whoa! - (Neighing) - What do you want, boy? Could you give me a ride to the next town? - You got money? - Er, a Little. - Get in back. - Thank you. - Yah! - Where do you think you're going? - (Laughter) - Get off of here. - Go find another wagon. - Wait! Please wait! (Laughter continues) (Animal shrieks) God Our heavenly father O God And my father, who's also in heaven May the Light Of this flickering candle Illuminate the night the way your spirit Illuminates my soul Papa... Can you hear me? Papa, can you see me? Papa, can you find me in the night? Papa, are you near me? Papa, can you hear me? Papa, can you help me not be frightened? Looking at the skies I seem to see a million eyes Which ones are yours? Where are you now that yesterday has waved goodbye And closed its doors? The night is so much darker The wind is so much colder The world I see is so much bigger Now that I'm alone Papa, please forgive me Try to understand me Papa, don't you know I had no choice? Can you hear me praying Anything I'm saying Even though the night is filled with voices? I remember everything you taught me Every book I've ever read Can all the words in all the books Help me to face what lies ahead? The trees are so much taller And I feel so much smaller The moon is twice as lonely And the stars are half as bright Papa, how I Love you Papa, how I need you Papa, how I miss you Kissing me good night  If I am not for myself, who will be for me? (Lowers pitch) Who will be for me? (Coughs) Who will be for me? If I am for myself alone, who am I? (Lower) Who am I? And if not now... - (Horse neighing in distance) - ... when? (Yentl) Wait! (Child shouting) - (Lively chatter) - (Man) Innkeeper, more soup! (Chatter continues, men singing) (Man) Did you hear that? (2nd man) Yes. I hear, I hear. (Singing continues) (Man) Who's throwing that? Don't throw that. I told you not to. - Watch out! - (Man) Lithuania, Poland, same thing. A school is a school. It's only the rabbis that are different. The girls... - Why would the Talmud repeat itself? - It's an improper translation. - Even if they contradict each other? - Avigdor, what do you think? The Talmud recognises Life is filled with contradiction. - You see? He agrees. - Your move. - Ah! - What? - Nothing, sorry. - No, go on. It's just that, erm, if you move your castle - to queen 7... - Yes? His knight is pinned. That's all. You don't know what you're talking about. No. Sorry. (Youth) Stop yelling at me, Papa. (Man) I'm not yelling! Checkmate. The Long diagonal. Who knew? You shouldve listened to him. Chaim, catch! - You want a bite? - No, thank you. - Don't play. - Hey, you. You. - Sit down. - Why? Because I said so. Five kopecks if you win. Pay me one if you lose. What do I have to do? Whoever forces the other's hand down wins. - No, thanks. - Ready? Go! (Grunts) Wasn't it Rabbi Akiva who said, "The true strength of a man... " One kopeck. "... Lies in his ability to stretch the narrowest mind"? Thank you. You're welcome. Now you can stretch my mind again. Go. I think Rabbi Akiva also said... Two kopecks. - I thought it was one. - Mm. But I beat you I twice. Oh. Give him back his money. - Why? - Because I said so. Because you said so. I'll see you Later when your beard starts to grow. Mama's boy. - No, it wasn't, since you ask. - Hm? Rabbi Akiva. "The narrowest mind. " Oh. Er, was it Rabbi Eliezer? No, Rabbi Israel Salanter. Rabbi Israel Salanter. My brother didn't have one either. What? - Are you hungry? - A Little. - Help yourself. - Yes, please. Which yeshiva are you going to? I haven't decided. Someplace quiet. A quiet yeshiva? - Bechev's the best. - (Man) Well, the nearest. That's where we study. Well, I just count the days till I go home. His parents count the days until he goes back. Our rabbi's a genius. Rabbi Zalman? Maybe you've heard of him. I think so. In one answer, he settles ten questions. Papa had 10 questions for every answer. Had? He died eight days ago, may he rest in peace. You're in mourning too. My brother. Almost a month now. May he rest in peace. I'm Shimmele, by the way. - Oh. - (Both) Hello. - And you? - What? What's your name? - My name? - Name. Um... Anshel. That's it. That's my name. My name is Anshel. Good. You know your own name. You're as good a scholar as I am. - This is Avigdor. - I know. - I mean, hello. - (Man) Boys! Wagons to the north and west leaving now. And now means now! Goodbye. Anshel. (Lively chatter) (Chicken clucking) Anshel! Hey, are you deaf? Anshel! Anshel. Yes? There's room if you're still undecided. I just decided. ( Men singing and clapping) He tells him there's a fisherman who's got the strongest rod The cod he catches are so big And when they see his cod they scream!  - Where you from, Anshel? - Erm... A Little village you've never heard of. Yanev. Yanev? I have relatives in Yanev. A third cousin. - We moved. - What? (Yentl) Years ago. - You have relatives in Riga? - Riga? - No. - Now we live in Riga. Oh. (Avigdor) Were you close? (Yentl) He was my father and teacher. (Avigdor) What more could you ask? (Yentl) What about your brother? - We were brothers. - Older? Younger? - Younger, about your age. - What happened? Pneumonia. Sorry. Would you Like to discuss a page of Talmud? - Oh, no, not Talmud. - Which? - Whatever you're reading. - I'll state the premise. You dispute it. - When does day become night? - (Yentl) Sundown. - (Avigdor) When is sundown? - When you see three stars. Not precise enough. When's dusk? - When the light's no longer blue. - That's twilight. - Twilight is when objects are silhouettes. - Be quiet for five minutes! There's Bechev! We're home! (Lively chatter) (Yentl) How do I get into this yeshiva? (Avigdor) Rabbi Zalman tests you on what you know or what you think you know. (Yentl) Can I live at this Yeshiva? (Avigdor) No, but you'll find lodgings. There may be a room where I stay. (Man) I'm starving. (2nd man) You're always starving. - (Yentl) Wait for me! - You walk too slow. - (Yentl) You walk too fast. - The synagogue's to the left, the yeshiva's straight ahead, I live around the corner. - (Knock on door) - Who is it? - (Avigdor) It's me. - Avigdor? How many other boyfriends do you have? I'm so glad you're back! - (Laughs) Are you all right? - Yes, yes. When you see Hadass youll feel better. Who wants other girls when I've got you? - Shame! A wicked tongue. - I want you to meet my friend, Anshel. - Anshel, Mrs Jacobs. - Good evening. - Anshel? - Do you have a room for him? Oh, I'm sorry, dear, not tonight. My niece is here, but she leaves tomorrow. - All right, he can share my bed. - (Yentl) No, I can't. Why not? - I don't want to impose. - Don't be silly. - I'm a restless sleeper. - That's all right. I snore. (Avigdor) Come on. Young. Anshel, will you put out the lamp? I can't. I'm being tested by the rabbi tomorrow. So? You're going to Learn the entire Talmud by heart overnight? AII 2,555 pages? - You're tired, you sleep. - I'm exhausted. I've been in the wagon all day, all I want to do is sleep. Get in bed. - Would you Like to talk a Little? - Bed. - Why don't I just... - Get in bed. So, er... - Who's Hadass? - Hm? - Mrs Jacobs mentioned... - For God's sake! Sorry. It doesn't matter. Go back to sleep. The girl I'm engaged to. Oh. - (Thud) - Sorry. - Oh, it's your suitcase. - (Sighs) Is she, er, pretty, this Hadass? No. Beautiful. What colour hair does she have? I dine at her house every Tuesday. I'll take you. Thank you. (Avigdor sighs) - Red. - Hm. Red, huh? - Will you get into bed? - Sure. Youll fall off the edge. I always sleep Like this. - Why? - Why? I... I think it's written. What is? Two bachelors in the same bed must lie back to back. - Really? - Really. So turn over, please. Why'd you have to talk about Hadass? Now I'll never get to sleep. Why not? Don't you ever think sinful thoughts? - No. - No? - Yes! - Don't be so nervous. Why should I be nervous? You're being tested by the rabbi tomorrow. Mm. Mm. Good night. Good night. (Lively chatter) No, Anshel, the point of study is to teach us how to Live, not only to study. - Why? - Again, "Why?" My father quoted Hillel, who said... May I? - Hillel said, "May I?" - No, may I quote Hillel? Quote, quote. "He that increases wisdom increases Life. " Wisdom is the most important thing. Only as the means to an end. Wisdom is the means. Living is the end. Then, may I ask you another question? Ask, ask. If he that increases study increases wisdom, and therefore Life, then... You can't just grab it... That's not it. You can do it, so Long as... (Man) That's why the rabbi says you must use the Left side. Well? I don't know. He just said to me... - He asks a Lot of questions. - Sorry, I've been told that before. It's by their questions that we choose our students, not only by their answers. Your father taught you well, Anshel. Welcome to our yeshiva. I'm accepted? - I'm a student? - MazeI tov. I'm a student. And now, a study partner for him. There are moments You remember all your life...  MazeI tov, Anshel. There are moments you wait for and dream of All your life This is one of those moments I will always remember this chair That window The way the light streams in...  He's too advanced for them. The clothes Im wearing - The words Im hearing...  - Too advanced for Yessel. - The face Im seeing...  - So who? The feeling Im feeling...  - Me? - You? My chickens are too advanced for you. Thank you. - Avigdor? - ... will be written in my heart...  There's only me who is too advanced for him. - As long as I live...  - (Zalman) It's up to you. Well see. I can travel the past and take what I need To see me through the years What my father learned and his father before him Will be there for my eyes and ears I can walk through the forests of the trees of knowledge And listen to the lesson of the leaves I can enter rooms where there are rooms within rooms Wrapped in a shawl that learning weaves I remember, Papa Everything you've taught me What you gave me, Papa Look at what it's brought me There are certain things that once you have No man can take away No wave can wash away No wind can blow away And now they're about to be mine No tide can turn away No fire can burn away No time can wear away...  (All shouting) I can open doors, take from the shelves All the books I've longed to hold I can ask all the questions, the whys and the wheres As the mysteries of life unfold Like a link in a chain from the past to the future Joins me with the children yet to be I can now be a part of the ongoing stream That has always been A part of me There are certain things that once you have No man can take away No wave can wash away No wind can blow away...  Anshel, come down. No fire can burn away No time can wear away...  Where in the Talmud does it say, "possession is nine tenths of the Law"? Shimmele. - Er... Yebamot? - No. - No, it's Baba Metzia. - No! - It's Baba Kama, page 29a. - No! Forgive me. It's Baba Kama, but it's 31b. - There are moments...  - Anshel is right. ... you remember all your life There are moments you wait for and dream of All your life This is one of those moments  (Crystals tinkling) (Clock chiming) (Muffled chatter, crystals tinkling) (Yentl) Mm... Perfect. Beautiful. Congratulations, Anshel. Accepted in a fine yeshiva. - Your father would be proud. - I hope so. - He was a scholar too? - Yes, yes, he was. Now his son after him. May your father rest in peace. (Both) May he rest in peace. Avigdor's brother too. He told you? Um, yes, he did. Consumption, a terrible thing. Esther! - At our table, two scholars waiting. - I'm coming. I'd Like to have a toast to the new yeshiva boy. - Lechaim. - (Both) Lechaim. - How was the fish, boys? - Delicious. - Hadass made it. - It's Avigdor's favourite. (Reb Alter) I hope so. We get it every Tuesday! It's very good. It's good fish. You have a lovely home, Mrs Vishkower. Such beautiful things, the silver, the dishes, the tablecloth. Thank you, Anshel. It's nice of you to notice. Oh! I'm sorry. It's all right. You, erm, you come from a big family? - No. - No brothers or sisters? - No. - Your father never remarried? - No. - Esther. I'm just curious. Who took care of them? If I knew Talmud the way my wife knows everybody's business, I'd be the sage of all sages. (Esther) Don't you pay any attention. No wonder he loves her No wonder at all The moment she sees him Her thought is to please him...  Horseradish is good for you. Before he even knows that he's hungry She's already there with his plate Before his glass is even empty she's filling it up God forbid he should wait...  Before he has the chance to tell her he's chilly she'll go put a log on the fire Fulfilling his every desire No trouble No bother...  - Carrots? - No, thank you. No wonder She's pretty What else should she be? She hasn't a worry And why should she worry? When she gets up, her biggest decision Is figuring out what to wear To pick a blouse, a skirt, and then there's the problem Of what should she do with her hair And later as she stands and studies a chicken The question's to roast or to not roast Or better yet, maybe a pot roast Tomatoes? No...  - Potatoes. - Mm. No wonder He likes it It's perfect this way Who wouldn't want someone who fusses and flatters Who makes you feel that you're all that matters Whose only aim in life is to serve you And make you think she doesn't deserve you? - No wonder...  - It's all right. - ... he loves her...  - It happens. - What else could he do?  - All the time. Ha-ha! If I were a man I would too  - (Esther) Let's try dessert. - Yes, Mother. Good, hm? (Both chuckling) Let's go this way. - She makes the best almond cakes. - Mm. - I thought it was pneumonia. - Hm? - Your brother. - It was. - Vishkower said consumption. - Did he? They were very impressed with you. "Beautiful dishes, beautiful home. " I didn't open my mouth the first two months except to eat. Is she always that nervous? She's a girl... in Love. What do you expect? She doesn't say very much. What does she have to say? Don't you ever wonder what she's thinking? No. - What could she be thinking? - (Yentl laughs) I don't need her to think. I can do that with you. Wrong. The Hebrew for rib never meant rib, it meant side. Rib, side, what's the difference? Adam was created male and female. - Where's that written? - Genesis, chapter five. If God took one side of Adam and created woman, that means we're all the same. You've never been with a woman. I mean they share masculine and feminine qualities. - Look, can you do that? - What? Create Life, give birth to sons? When you can, then tell me we're the same. Another interpretation, the true story of Adam and Eve - God wouldnt make her from Adam's ear Lest she be an eavesdropper. Nor from his heart, lest she be jealous. But from a hidden part of the body, so she be modest. - In other words, the rib! - No, no, not the rib! - Side! - Rib! - Side! - Rib. Admit you're wrong. - Admit it. Admit it! - I will not! I'm not wrong! - Admit it! - Get off! I can't breathe! I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Come on. - Where are you going? - Come on! Avigdor, wait! - Avigdor! - (Children laughing) - Avigdor, where are you? - Over here! - Come on in. - Oh, my God. (Men chatting, indistinct) - Come on in! - No! Er... There's a passage here that, erm... - It's the only way to cool off! - No, it's all right. I'II, er... I'll watch the clothes. (Man) Don't throw me in the water. (Indistinct shouting) Shimmele, come on in! (Lively shouts) (Laughter and chatter) - (Man) How's the water? - It's good. It's fun. It feels wonderful. Whoo! - You're really missing something. - Am I? - (Sighs) The water's perfect. - Is it? - Here, your pants. - What a day. - Put on your pants. - What a pleasure! - It must be a sin. - It couldnt be. Anshel! Come on in! - That's enough studying! - No, no, it's too cold. - The water's warm. - No, I catch cold easily. That's not the reason. Why didn't you tell me? - What? - You can't swim. I can't swim. That's right. I can't swim. I can't swim! Neither can I. That's why I stay where it's shallow. - Come on, I'll teach you. - No. - Don't be afraid. - No! I don't Like swimming! - Take off your clothes. - No! Stop it! Please, stop it! - Are you ashamed? Embarrassed? - I don't want to! - All right! - I don't want to! All right, all right. If you're that scared... I'm not going to force you. - Next time. - Sure. When you're ready. There's no chill And yet I shiver There's no flame and yet I burn Im not sure what Im afraid of And yet Im trembling There's no storm, yet I hear thunder And I'm breathless, why, I wonder Weak one moment then the next I'm fine I feel as if I'm falling every time I close my eyes And flowing through my body is a river of surprise Feelings are awakening I hardily recognise as mine What are all these new sensations? What's the secret they reveal? I'm not sure I understand But I Like the way I feel La la, la la Oh, why is it that every time I close my eyes he's there? The water shining on his skin, the sunlight in his hair And all the while I'm thinking things That I can never share with him I'm a bundle of confusion Yet it has a strange appeal Did it all begin with him And the way he makes me feel? I Like the way He makes me feel  (Sighs) (Man) Which is the greater crime, stealing by day or by night? - (2nd man) By day. - By night. - What's wrong? - That's what I wanna know. Every morning, you exhaust the five books of Moses and the entire mystery of the universe. This morning, nothing. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Just Like my brother. In a world of your own, not speaking your mind, moody. - Who's moody? - Worried about something? - No. - Studies? I'm your study partner. Tell me if you are. With me sitting next to you, why worry? I know. I'll take you to the matchmaker. - I'm not going to any matchmaker. - Shell give you something nice. Excuse me, gentlemen. Thank you, Sophie. Avigdor, please. My future father-in-Law wants to see me. - We're going tonight. - No, now. - What for? - Dowry, wedding ceremony... - the wedding night! - Why do you keep grabbing me? What? You're always grabbing me. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. So? Everything has to have a reason? The wedding night! (Bell ringing) Hello, Sophie. Is Avigdor here? Erm, he, er... Excuse me. (Muffled sobbing) What's... what's wrong? - (Sobbing) - What's the matter? Anshel, I'm sorry. You're still welcome, no matter what's happened. Sophie will get you something to eat. - (Sobbing) - Where's Avigdor? Excuse me, Reb Alter, but... (Esther) Hadass, sweetheart, try to understand. Avigdor. I just came from... What happened? The wedding's off. Why? He says I have the evil eye, says melancholy runs in our blood. What are you saying? No man can Let his daughter marry into a family Like that. Avigdor, what are you talking about? - They found out. - What? - About my brother. - What about him? He didn't die of pneumonia or consumption. He committed suicide. Oh, my God. So no wedding. No sons. What's all this for? - Did you talk to Hadass? - What for? She loves you, she'll still marry you. - Not if her parents say no. - If she thinks her parents are wrong... She's a woman! She can't think for herself. That's nonsense! You want a philosophical argument? I've lost the one girl that I've ever loved, that I'll ever Love! Youll fall in Love again. No. Hadass is a nice girl but don't make her into more than she is. I'm not. She was exactly what I wanted. Please go. (Thunder) I'm sorry. Is this really happening, Anshel? Maybe... someone else will turn up for you. Maybe not... quite as pretty, maybe with brown hair. I wouldnt notice her if she did. (Thunder) (Clock ticking) (Yentl) Why punish him for something his brother did? Anshel, please. Hadass should be proud to be his wife. - Anshel. - Love is all that matters. No, there are other things. Don't talk old wives' tales, talk the Law. I'll talk Life! What matters is a man's children. It's his children that your Law exists for, her children! That's her only dowry. And my obligation as a father. I have one daughter. I want the best for her. Avigdor is the best. The best scholar, maybe, the best friend. But not the best choice. We want someone from a good family, someone with no secrets to hide. Someone Like... Someone else. Anshel. A Little more? In the middle of the night, he goes to school. What did you have for dinner? What did I have for dinner? Very Little. And Hadass? She's still in Love. What do you expect? How did she Look? Not as bad as you do. You didn't miss anything. It was Like a madhouse. The whole familys going crazy. What do you mean? Well, it's just that... (Clears throat) I'm sure Reb Alter... I mean, to save face, they're going to try to marry her off... After a broken engagement, they have to. It's usual. - Did they mention someone? - No, no. - But they were looking at me. - You? (Laughing) Can you imagine? Shows you how desperate they are. (Laughing) (Laughter continues) - What's the matter? - The books. Avigdor? What's the matter? That's a sin! What are you doing? Avigdor, please, just tell me what's happening. - The books! - What? - What are you doing? - Where is it? - What are you Looking for? - Oh, here it is. - What's the matter? - Sit down. Sit. I... Anshel, I'm going to make you the happiest man in the world. - Yes? - It is the Law, and it's written. You Like everything written. - What's written, Avigdor? - (Speaks Hebrew) It's perfect. We are Like brothers. If one dies, it is the other's obligation to marry his widow. Who's died? I want you to marry Hadass. - Oh, no. - Yes. Never, Avigdor, I couldnt. - Why not? - Why not? - She Loves you. - Let me explain. I'm not your brother. - In my eyes, you are! - I don't want to marry her! - I don't Love her! - That's good! - What are you talking about? - Listen! It's meant to be! Nothing's meant to be. The thought of her with another man, a total stranger, drives me crazy. You marrying her would be the nearest thing to me marrying her. They may marry her to someone she doesn't know! - She could never Love me. - She likes you. I could see her, visit you both. You're talking Like a madman. If they take her away, I'll never see her again. - Shell take care of you. - No. - Wealthy family, beautiful girl... - No! - Why do you have to be different? - Please, that's enough. Oh! What's the matter with you? Any other man would... Anshel, time will go by. Tempers cool, things change. Who knows? Perhaps even her father. Your marriage could be dissolved. Hadass and I could... She means that much to you? Who better will you find? Who better will she find? - Do it, for all of us. - I can't! It's impossible. Nothing's impossible. Just think about it. I've thought. It's out of the question. The answer is no. Another question. Do you feel anything for me? What? Do you? Of course I do. Then think again. More noodles? They're your favourite. How do you know? You told me Last week at dinner. - I don't remember. - I do. It's a little chilly in here. I thought it was rather warm myself. It is warm... for this time of year. No wonder she suits him She never disputes him...  Last year, it was also warm. The conversation's not too exciting But oh, what a change it must be To spend an evening where there's no conversation - Must be a relief after me...  - I'll get dessert. And though there's nothing much to challenge your mind here Who cares when the food's so delicious? Not to mention these beautiful dishes A matched set From France yet...  You Look pensive. No, I was just thinking. About me? As a matter of fact, I was. Good thoughts, I hope. Something smells good. What is it? It must be the cinnamon in the baked apple. You bake apples too? No wonder he loves her No wonder to me...  - A cushion? - Why not? With ribbons and laces In all the right places...  - Milk or lemon? - Yes, please. I must admit it's all very pleasant and this is a comfortable room...  - Which? - Which what? And if he likes the smell of lilacs and roses - Then maybe he likes her perfume...  - Lemon or milk? And though her silky hair and milky complexion are nice - Still they're not that distracting...  - Anshel? - Milky. - What? Milk, milk! So what accounts for the way he's been acting?  - Honey? - Her softness...  - No honey. - Her sweetness...  Sugar? How could he resist her?  - An almond cookie? - And why would he try?  How do you get them all the same size? No wonder he wants her...  - You notice everything. - He needs her...  The china. Cookies. No wonder...  That's really wonderful. So would I  Where are your parents? Maybe they'd Like some tea. They're in the study having tea with a guest from Zamosc. Yesterday, two came from Tomashev. I must be going. I may have to leave Bechev if they don't find someone for me here. They'll find someone. Who wouldnt want you? I mean... - Don't you think about marriage? - No, just my studies. - I admire that in a man. - That's very good. Good night. Good night. He's not there, Anshel. He's gone. He took his things and Left. Hurry! Wagons to Lublin province leaving now! Wagons to Lublin province Leaving now! Avigdor, don't leave! I was wrong! - You? - She's worth fighting for! - Talk to Vishkower. - He won't listen! - Maybe there's a Law. - There are no laws, not for this. If you stopped studying once in a while, you'd know more about Life, about Love. How can I expect you to understand? You've never felt it. Last call for Lublin province! Avigdor! (Baby crying) - Oh, my God. - Carry your suitcase, sir? Bye, Anshel. I'm sorry about everything. Asking what I did was my only way of staying and it was wrong. No, it's not wrong. It's understandable. You're in Love. - It was sinful, unnatural. - But what's natural? - I was asking the impossible. - Don't go, Avigdor! Everyone aboard! Don't go! I'll come with you! Wait! Avigdor! Nothing's impossible! Nothing. It's impossible. What do you think, Zelig? I never had such trouble fitting anybody. - It's so tight round the chest. - It fits! - This is how you cut. - It's the tape measure. It's all right. For Alter Vishkower's son-in-Law, we must do our best work. - I Like it this way. - He Likes it this way! Ha! - Look at him. - Look at me I must be absolutely crazy How did I ever let it get this far?  Take off the coat. Im getting deeper into trouble Am I a woman or a man? Am I a devil or a demon? Problem with the pants. Next to them, the coat looks good. Take them off. - Why? - Why? Papa was right I ask too many questions he said a soul can get perplexed I can't believe what happens next Papa was right!  - Trouble with the crotch. - What's wrong? Youll find out when you relieve yourself. It seems this little game I play becomes more risky every day  - The pants, please. - All right, I'll take them off. - Leave the room. - He's ashamed. A tailor is Like a doctor. What's to be ashamed? Move, Zelig! The wedding's tomorrow night! (Tailor) Move! Tomorrow night? Tomorrow night? Tomorrow night, tomorrow night Under the canopy I'll stand with her tomorrow night And place a ring upon her hand With her all dressed in white Tomorrow night I don't know how this came about but I'll be wed without a doubt - I've got to get out!  - (Tailor) What did you say? I've got to get out of my clothes. Get back out here. - Look at this...  - Come on, move. The way one lie begets another Somebody wake me up and say it's all a dream...  - Ouch! - Look at this! Look how easily I fool them They may have eyes but they don't see they never really look at me People are blind How else would everyone believe me? It might be interesting to know just how much further I can go...  Look, the right sieve is Longer than the Left! - This will never work. - Well make it work! At Least the hat fits. Tomorrow night, tomorrow night I can't believe what I'll presume to be Tomorrow night Im not the bride, but Im the groom-to-be Tomorrow night And that's a monumental trick I'd better think of something quick  Oh, my God, I'm feeling sick! Just the usual nerves before the wedding. - I'd better rest. - Youll need plenty of rest! I could run away I could leave without a trace Go anywhere or anyplace Where no one knows my face as a woman or a man I don't know, just so I can run away Run away Id be free Id be rid of all of this But there's someone I would miss And being near him is what this Is all about So running away is out (Zelig) Will he get away with it? (Tailor) Will we get away with it? Papa, dear You dreamed of dancing at my wedding But something tells me that Im right you wouldn't want to dance tonight  Take off the clothes. All right. Well Leave the room. Come, Zelig, we have a Lot of work to do. Isn't this A strangely logical solution? Things may not be as they appear but the advantages are clear He loves her, she loves him He Likes me, I Like her And I've reason to think she Likes me She keeps him, he keeps her I keep things as they were It's a perfect arrangement for three Who'd have ever predicted the moment would come When Id find myself grateful they've kept women dumb? She's an innocent maiden, but then, so am I That's why it's possible I could get by Look, Ive seen the impossible happen before Maybe, God willing, itll happen once more For I feel like a train on a perilous track No way to stop, no way to go back A snowball that's gathering speed down a hill Going faster and faster and faster until Tomorrow night, tomorrow night Even if someone would pray for me Tomorrow night There's not a prayer that they could say for me Tomorrow night Tomorrow night, tomorrow night, tomorrow night Is now tonight!  (All cheering) (AII) MazeI tov! (Man) Blessings! Success! MazeI tov! (Drowned out by chatter) (Rabbi) Musicians, please! The mitzvah dance! The handkerchief dance! - Excuse me. - (Rabbi) Where are you going? (Tailor) Look. Look at the shoulders. You're not Leaving, are you? I have a wedding present for both of you. - Thank you. - Nachmonides, the holy letter. He wrote it over 500 years ago. "Converse with her to put her mind at ease. "Speak words which arouse her to Love, desire, and passion, "and words of reverence for God. " Never force her. Her mood must be as yours. Win her with graciousness and seductiveness. Be patient until her passion is aroused. Begin with Love. And when her mood is ready, Let her desire be satisfied first. Her delight is what matters. (Women talking appreciatively) - ( Lively music) - Come along. - Avigdor, I... I don't know if I can... - (Alter) Anshel. - Anshel. - Your father-in-law's calling you. ( Lively music continues) Anshel, I have to talk to you. Remember your obligation. As I said, you mustn't be nervous. Eve was made from Adam's rib to obey his wishes. So must you. - There's nothing to be nervous about. - Yes, Mother. We have protected her. She knows nothing. But I don't have to tell you to be fruitful and multiply. Thank you, sir, I know the Law. May your wedding night be as joyful as ours... was. And, please God, a grandson nine months from now. ( Lively music) (Music and laughter downstairs) Are you too warm? (Hadass) No. - Shall I open a window? - No. Unless you want to. You're the man. That's true. - Don't be frightened. - I'm not. You're not? - Yes, I am. - Good. - What? - I mean, it's only natural. You don't have to do anything you don't want to. Anything. But I do. I have to do whatever you demand. - No, that's not so. - It's not? The Talmud says a woman may refuse her husband. - My mother said... - Too many women don't know the Law! If you want to refuse then naturally I respect your wishes. You're a very considerate man, Anshel. Only because I know you're thinking of someone else. Who? I'm not at all, of anyone. You mustn't be angry with him. What? Well, any woman would be who was close to him. You're very understanding. It's only natural that you wish he were here instead of me. But you're my husband. The thing is, Hadass, because you're still thinking of Avigdor, I can't Let you commit any unnecessary sin. - Sin? - It's clearly written that a woman cannot give herself to one man while she's thinking of another. Tonight we'll do what you want, which is nothing, I understand. - I don't know what I want. - When you do, you must Let me know. You're very hard to resist, Hadass, but I'm not going to force myself on you. I'II... I'll just have to be patient. - Good. - Good. Ah! A drop more wine? (Yentl chuckles) It's our secret. No one needs to know. Our secret. And our friendship. - A husband and wife can be friends? - Oh, yes. There's only one problem. Help me. In the morning, when they come in, they'll think we've... - But we haven't! - Shh! Secret! - Shh! - (Both giggling) Wait, no, just one bed. (Giggling) - You silly goose! - (Laughter) (Laughter continues) - (Crash) - Ooh! You tell me. Truce, truce! (Both Laughing) (Hadass) Oh! (Hadass sighs) Anshel. I think I'm going to Like being married to you. Good night, Hadass. Good night. (Burp) (Laughter) (Avigdor) So, er... what was it Like? - Oh, the usual. Music, dancing... - I was there. Oh. Hadass and I talked, laughed a little... Laughed a Lot. And then she went to sleep. Tell me the truth. People who want the truth never believe it. - What did you do to her? - What do you think I did to her? You kissed her, caressed her, held her. All right! I did everything Like you said. What else do you want to know? Did she make sounds? Did she scream...? - She screamed and went to sleep. - Went to sleep? - Anshel. - She talked a Little. Talked? In her sleep? What did she say? Things Like, "Avigdor, I Love you. " "I Love you"? Go on. "I adore you, Avigdor," she said. That's the truth? Yes, my friend. That's the truth. Raspberry tea is very good for headaches. - Thank you. - Am I disturbing you? No. It's almost sundown, the Sabbath. Yes. Mother says it's a special blessing on the Sabbath. - Going to synagogue? - Going to bed. Mm. - Unless you're tired. - What? Drink your tea. It's getting cold. When Avigdor used to call, I sometimes spilled things. - I don't know if you ever noticed. - No, never. It's because he made me tremble, inside. That's Love, Hadass. But you don't make me tremble. You make me peaceful. That's the friendship I was telling you about. - In the Talmud... - So will you teach me? Teach you? Please? - Talmud? - Talmud? - Talmud! - Not the Talmud. Talmud! It's the Least a husband can do for his wife, the most maybe. I could never Learn Talmud. Nonsense! Lock the door. - Isn't it a sin? - It's not a sin. Then why are we closing the curtains and locking the door? God will understand. I'm not so sure about the neighbours. - (Laughs) - What's funny? You. I've never seen you so excited. Now pay attention, Hadass. First there's the Bible, - the five books of Moses... - Wait. - Where are you going? - The soup's on the stove... Let your mother do it, please! The Talmud is commentaries interpreting the... - What are you doing? - Just pulling a thread... - Don't! We're studying! - Yes, Anshel. - Where was I? - Commentaries interpreting the Bible. Yes. The first commentary is the Mishna, our code of Law. I'm glad your headache's better. It's a masterpiece of literature, folklore, and philosophy, it deals with astronomy, architecture, medicine. Everything from making Love to planting Egyptian beans. Making Love? To planting Egyptian beans. I thought you said something about making Love. Then there's the midrash - legends, stories, dealing with legal issues. Two men dispute the ownership of a flock of chickens... While your books argue about chickens, I've had to pluck them. It's Friday. I've been up since dawn. I'm too tired to be a scholar on Fridays, Anshel. I'm sorry. I'm the one who's sorry, Hadass. I'm too tired for the special Sabbath blessing, even if maybe you were going to... demand it... Maybe. (Quiet snoring) (Bell tolling) (Lively chatter) Next Tuesday, eight oclock. What about her parents? I'll just say, "Avigdor's coming to dinner. " Anyway, they're away next Tuesday. Are you two agreeing or disagreeing? - Agreeing. - Disagreeing. - Disagreeing. - Agreeing. - (Hadass) He's one second late. - Hm? Oh... yes. (Doorbell) - Hello, Sophie. - I'll take your hat. (Yentl) Thank you, Sophie. Hello. This is the one I brought from home. The first part's about the ancient mystics. It's all a bit elementary, but... Welcome, Avigdor. (Yentl and Hadass Laughing) - (Hadass) Tell me more. - I've told you everything. (Hadass) It was a very interesting discussion. And then what happened? Well, erm... Avigdor was there too. He'll tell you. Was Rabbi Zalman angry or did he laugh? He... he laughed. Didn't he, Avigdor? - Yes. - Did you laugh? We both did. I can just see you. - I'll do that. - No. But you have a guest. So have you. (Avigdor) Marriage agrees with you. - You're more beautiful than ever. - Thank you. Avigdor, I'm concerned about Anshel. - What are you talking about? - I don't think Anshel is happy. Why don't we have tea in the parlour? Milk or, er... Lemon? Fine. (Hadass) Ah! Sorry. ( Hadass humming melody) We Left off with Maimonides' code of the golden rule. (Humming) Let's read chapters seven and eight and then discuss them. Is that all right? - All right. - (Stops humming) Don't stop, Hadass. It's pretty. (Humming) Look at how he looks at her Will someone ever look at me that way? Full of all the feelings And the soft unspoken words that lovers say I thought that I knew every single look And sweet expression on his face Yet this is one that I don't recognise Although Ive sat and studied him for hours But now I see how love completely occupies A pair of eyes See the way they gaze at her Like slaves they follow everywhere she goes Do my eyes forget themselves And do I ever look at him And smile in such a way That what Im feeling shows? Sometimes I have the feeling Everybody knows And even though it's crazy Still I can't help wondering if I'll ever live to see that day When by some Miracle of miracles He'll turn around and look at me That way...  It's no good. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Avigdor. Avigdor, wait! (Avigdor) Good night. Anshel. (Yentl) Hm? How many children do you want? The actual number? I don't think I've ever really... He didn't make me tremble tonight. (Yentl) Hm? You did, though. What's even nicer, I made you tremble. What? When he was Leaving, I put my hand on yours. You were trembling. Er, well... What are you doing, Hadass? - I'm Looking at you. - I can't read without my glasses. When you told me I could refuse you, you didn't tell me I also could demand you. Who told you that? The Talmud. I forget what page. - 63a and b. - It's written, Anshel. You've been studying too hard. You said to tell you when I knew what I wanted. I do. It isn't Avigdor. It's no Longer a sin. - H-Hadass, I... - Shh. It's been terrible for you, I know, all this waiting. But it's all right now. You don't have to wait any Longer. Oh, God! Oh, God! I'm so sorry. - I'm so sorry, Hadass. - For what? For teaching me? For understanding me? For making me fall in Love with you? I can't! I can't! I feel so certain that you Love me. Everything you do shows me you Love me. What is it, Anshel? Look at how she looks at me But I can never look at her that way...  Is it me? Am I so...? - Do you find me...? - I find you beautiful, beautiful. Then what? Full of all the feelings And the soft unspoken words that lovers say...  There are things I wish I could explain, things I'd Like to tell you. I feel so... - Maybe youll feel better tomorrow. - I hope so. In all the words in all the books I wish there were a way to say What she's taught me isn't written anywhere And Im supposed to be the one who's wise One thing is certain I can never be what she Expects of me I've wanted the shadows I don't any more No matter what happens I won't any more I've run from the sunlight Afraid it saw too much The moon had the one Light I bathed in I waked in I held in my feelings And closed every door No matter what happens I can't any more There's someone who must hear The words I've never spoken Tonight if he were here My silence would be broken I need him to touch me To know the Love that's in my heart The same heart that tells me To see myself To free myself To be myself at Last For too many mornings The curtains were drawn It's time they were opened To welcome the dawn A voice deep inside's getting stronger I can't keep it quiet any Longer No matter what happens It can't be the same any more I promise It won't be The same Any more  I'll miss you. Youll have lots to do while I'm gone. - I know, but... - Tell your parents I'm sorry. Sorry? That I wasn't here when they got home. Youll see them on Friday. You can tell us about the city. Show them the books you bought. Oh... I baked almond cakes. You and Avigdor wouldnt Last three days without my almond cakes. Thank you. Hurry home. It won't be the same here without you. Hadass. Do you remember what we studied Last week in the Talmud about patience? Tell me, what did we read? "Patience yields many good things. " If you have patience, youll have everything you want. Children, beautiful children, as many as you want. Trust me. I do trust you. Well, I... have to be going. I'll study while you're away. I want you to be proud of me. Oh, I am proud of you. You should be proud of yourself. I Love you, Anshel. I Love you too. She's mother She's sister She's lover She's the wonder of wonders No man can deny So why would he change her? She's loving, she's tender She's woman So am I  This trip was a good idea, Anshel. - I have a secret to tell you. - Tell me. - Not now. - All right. (Avigdor chuckles) So my crazy plan was crazy after all. What? She Loves you now. - She only thinks she does. - What? Things aren't always what they seem. What are you talking about? Youll see. Now, what's this secret of yours? I'll tell you when we get to Lublin. (Avigdor) Look, there's our friend again. (Yentl) I wonder if it ever gets tired? - When are you going to tell me? - Not yet. - Why not? - I just can't. Slivovitz? No, thanks. So let's hear the secret of yours. Maybe I will have a glass. Good. You look a little pale. - Lechaim. - Lechaim. So tell me. Well, er... We're friends. What can't you tell me? All right. Avigdor, what would you do if all you wanted in Life was to study and it was forbidden? - It isn't forbidden. - What if it were? What would you do if some crazy Law said all men called Avigdor or all men with brown eyes were forbidden to study? - I'd study anyway. - Secretly? If I had to. Why? And that would be difficult, always hiding, afraid? Yes. What's your secret? Without studying, you couldnt Live. Is that right? - That's right. - I couldnt, either. - So? - So I studied, secretly. No, you didn't. What are you babbling about? Avigdor... my name isn't Anshel. That's your secret? Dear Avigdor. - I don't know how to tell you this. - Well, don't. I'll guess. - I'm not a yeshiva boy. - You're the chief rabbi of Lithuania. - I'm not any kind of boy. - Not the chief rabbi, all right. My name isn't Anshel. It's... it's Yentl. Yentl? And... I'm a woman. A woman. A woman. Now my secret. - I'm the Tsar of Russia. - Then I'll prove it. - Stop this, Anshel. - I'm not Anshel. I'm Yentl. - I'm not a man. I'm a woman. - Stop it. - I'm a woman, Avigdor. - Anshel, I don't Like this. What kind of a game is this? It's not a game. Not any more. What are you doing? What are you doing? (Avigdor sighs) Oh, my God. I've only shown you so you can testify to the rabbis. It can't be. It is. What have you done? - Listen to me. - Don't come near me. - Let me explain. - Don't touch me. Avigdor, don't be afraid, I'm not going to hurt you. - You're a monster. - No. AII I ever wanted to do was study. "A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth to a man. " - You're a devil. - Try to understand... - Enough! Please! - I'm not a devil. Every commandment broken, every day! Stay away from me! Please! What are you, a demon? - I'm not. - You spit on the Torah! I Love the Torah! You spit on it, on everything and everyone. In God's face, my face, Hadass's face! - God, Hadass! - She knows nothing! - Nothing? - No, she's never... An innocent married to a devil! You married a woman! - How could you do that? - It was your idea! - This? My doing? - Yes! Come on, you're a man. Answer me Like a man. I want to know why. Why? Why didn't you say you were a woman? I was afraid of this, of exactly this! So you lied to me, you lied to Hadass! I told you things I wouldnt tell a wife! - I'm glad you told me. - What kind of creature are you? - Just a woman. - I want the answer. Tell me the answer. Why? Why? - I... I was afraid. - Why? - I wanted to be near you. - Why? I didn't wanna Lose you. I Loved you. (Sobbing) (Avigdor) Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God. (Sobbing) I Loved you. I thought you didn't understand about Love. No wonder. My God, no wonder. All the times I looked at you and touched you and I couldnt understand why. I thought something was wrong with me. There was nothing wrong with you. It was me. Your skin. It's so... Your hair... It must have been beautiful. Itll grow. Your hands... I always tried to hide them. Oh, no. I did... I... I didn't want to touch you. I was afraid to. Your mouth... Yentl. I Loved you too. Hadass. It's not... difficult. I'll write a statement to the rabbis that the marriage was never consummated. You can take it back to Beshev, give it to the rabbis. The rabbis witnessed it. Witnessed what, a marriage between two women? It's null and void. According to divorce procedures... No, according to God, it was not a marriage. This is crazy. I'm arguing Talmud with a woman. It's not the first time. Go back to her, Avigdor. I don't think Hadass will Listen to her parents any more. Maybe there's something we can do, a Law or something... Avigdor, there's no book with this in it. Sometimes... right can come from wrong, virtue from sin. It's in the Talmud somewhere. Well go to another town. Well get married, have children. Well find a new yeshiva. For both of us? You still want to study? We've argued the Bible back to Genesis, chapter one, verse one. How could you still ask me that question? You don't need to any more. I'll do the thinking, I'll handle everything. I want to study with you, not darn socks. - Impossible. - Nothing's impossible. You can study at home. No one has to know. And draw the curtains, close the shutters? - I want you to be a real woman. - I am. Then act Like one! There's no gift from God more beautiful and miraculous. You know everything without opening books. What more do you want? More. Your beard. I suppose itll never grow in now. How could I have been so blind? Here's a statement for the rabbi and a note for Hadass. Would you give it to her for me, please? I'll miss you. I'll miss you too, Avigdor. Goodbye, Anshel. Yentl. Yentl. There are moments You remember all your Life There are moments you know Will be with you all your Life His face Will be written on my mind Will be written in my heart As Long as I Live  My dear Avigdor. After many months, your letter finally reached me. I hope this one finds you! Since we said goodbye, Ive prayed that, despite the pain Ive caused, some happiness would come out of it. And now you tell me it has. As for me, Im going to a new place where I hear things are different. Anyway, we'll see. Take care of yourself, and Hadass. I hope she continues with her studies. She has great promise. And remember, I will love you both, always. Tell me where Where is it written what it is Im meant to be? That I can't dare? It all began The day I found That from my window I could only see a piece of sky I stepped outside And looked around I never dreamed it was so wide Or even half as high The time had come Papa, can you hear me? To try my wings Papa, are you near me? And even though it seemed at any moment I could fall I felt the most... Papa, can you see me? ... amazing things Can you understand me? The things you can't imagine If you've never flown at all Though it's safer to stay on the ground Sometimes where danger Lies There the sweetest of pleasures are found No matter where I go There'll be memories that tug at my sieve But there will also be More to question, yet more to believe Oh, tell me where Where is the someone who will turn to look at me? And want to share My every sweet imagined possibility? The more I live The more I Learn The more I Learn, the more I realise The less I know Each step I take Papa, I've a voice now Each page I turn Papa, I've a choice now Each mile I travel only means The more I have to go What's wrong with wanting more? If you can fly, then soar With all there is Why settle for... Just a piece of sky? Papa, I can hear you Papa, I can see you Papa, I can feel you Papa Watch me Fly
