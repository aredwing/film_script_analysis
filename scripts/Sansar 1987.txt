Deen Dayal-ji, Deen Dayal-ji. Come, come Pundit-ji. Greeting! - Greeting! How did you come you come to our house today. This is the law of the world. Without any work you do not show affection. I have brought such a news that.. ..you will shower me with gifts and compliments. Where is Deen Dayal-ji? - he must.. ..be coming from the office. Greetings Pundit-ji. - Greetings, greetings. Have you brought any good news for me? Yes, yes tomorrow some people.. ..are coming to see your daughter Rajni. Oh wow! - The boys father has a.. ..very big factory for making clothes in Kanpur. - Oh. The boy is a hero. - Hero? I mean he is a diamond. The boy is a very big officer in Kanpur highway electrical. Wow pundit-ji wow! There shouldn't be any dearth in the hospitality. Don't worry. You first go and bring them. Yes, yes I will bring them. Bye, bye. - Bye. Is it okay now? Godavari, Godavari do you remember.. ..that the groom's family is coming to see our daughter. If there will be any dearth in the hospitality. Them we will loose the relationship and our respect. Make very good sweets. Sweets should be like that, on seeing.. ..the mouth should start watering. And before taking in the mouth the syrup should fall. It fell. - You shut up. And sweets of carrot and put dry fruits in them. And make sweets of semolina in pure ghee. Just like slip when you keep your.. ..feet on the skin of a banana. Just like that the sweet should slip in.. ..the stomach when you keep it in the mouth. You are very smart sir, whose stomach will this sweet slip in? Gangu Bai, Gangu Bai stop you nonsense. I am not talking to you. I am talking to my dear wife. When your wife came in this house. I came here as a servant even before that. I was so small when l started working here. Mistress, didn't the doctor tell us.. ..that he has sugar problems. Shut up. - He has sugar problems.. ..that he is looking for a chance to have some sugar. You are very smart sir. Gangu Bai, for God's sake keep quiet. Godavari, Godavari I was saying.. ..that there will be four types of.. ..guests so their will be different.. ..types of requests also. Yes, yes that is right. That is why I am telling you that.. ..along with four different types.. ..of sweets also make four different types of delicacies. So that you can get to eat your fill. Gangu bai. - Sir, close this mouth of yours. What will happen by closing my mouth? You will eat it then when you will have.. ..gas in the night then you will shout Godavari! Godavari! There is an auto-rickshaw going on in my stomach! How did the water of this well dry up so much. What? Sister! Sister! Never interfere in my affairs. Otherwise I will wring your neck and throw you in the well. Did you understand? - Yes I understood. In others house if the family of the.. ..groom does not like the bride. Then the bride's family become very sad. But in our house if the groom's family likes the bride. Then father-in-law becomes very sad. - Why daughter-in-law? First of all that father-in-law loves.. ..everyone so much that he cannot see anyone go away. And second of all he enjoys being a host. The guests should keep coming.. ..in this house for some reason. And good food should be cooked every time. So that even the guests should be happy. And even father-in-law should get to taste it. This is the magic of your hands daughter-in-law. The feast outside and the food in the house. Both taste the same. What happened daughter-in-law? Should I give you some medicine? No, no mother-in-law. You just praised me that went to my head. Daughter-in-law burn some red chillies and salt in the fire. All the evil eyes will burn. Really I have not seen this much.. ..Iove between mother and daughter. That is there between this mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Oh God! I hope I don't cast an evil eye on you. Why do you keep troubling me every time? Last time some body had come.. ..to see the bride from Sarnagpur. This time some body is coming from Kanpur. Next time some body will come from Nagpur. My bank balance is getting over.. ..in hospitality of the guests. Why are you shouting so much? Speak a little softer, father-in-law is sitting in the hall. If he hears then. - If he hears then will he behead me? On every 1 st of the month I give.. ..8 hundred rupees note to mother. I don't like this argument for hundred-two.. ..hundred rupees in the end of the month. Look, you prepare the budget of the.. ..company even in that there are some exceptions So if there are some exceptions.. ..in the budget of the house, so.. ..why are you getting angry in that. So what else can I do? Money doesn't grow on trees. Look this exceptions should not occur. Either there is a marriage in the house or anything else. I am not going to give anything.. ..more than 800 rupees. How is that possible? This is the question of the esteem of the house. Okay. I will do this the last time. But next time at least you try to understand. Shiva, oh Shiva, Shiva. Wake up, look what is the time you are still sleeping. Brother I have just returned a little.. ..while ago after doing night shift in the garage. Okay, okay, al right. I am going to the office, as it is I am late. You go to the bank and have this cheque cashed. And give the money to mother. Some people are coming to see Rajni. She will need this money. - Okay brother. Shiva, even you are Rajni's brother. The groom's family is coming to see her. Isn't it important for you to know that who is the groom? How he is and how is his family. Brother, when the elders are there in the house. What will I say in amid of all of you? This fool is there, to care of everyone. Greetings, greetings. - Greetings. Welcome, we were waiting for you. Come, come. Where are you going? If you will go inside with them then.. ..who will pay the rent of the taxi. It is 32 rupees 60 paisa. If they will not like the girl then will.. ..you return the 32 rupees 60 paisa? You are from the bride's side. Forget about getting anything. Learn only to give. Give it, give it. Come, come sit. Come Pundit-ji, even you take a seat. Jagmohan Lal-ji, he is the brides.. ..father Deen Dayal Sharma. He is a very big officer in the government's office. As soon as he keeps his foot in the office. All the big and small officers stand up. DeenDayal gets tired greeting them. But they do not get tired of greeting them. And he is the grooms father Jagmohan Das-ji. All the big cloth manufacturing mills run because of him. As soon as the cloth is manufactured.. ..it reaches his shop. All the big and small shops function because of him. He earns in lakhs and crores. That's enough Pundit-ji you are praising me unnecessarily. Actually it is not Pundit-ji's fault. There us no difference between.. ..his profession and a lawyers profession. Lawyers think that no matter how.. ..much you lie I should not loose the case. And he thinks that no matter how.. ..much he lies the relation should not break. Actually DeenDayal-ji I do not have a big business of cloth. I have a small clothes shop in Gandhi market. Then even you don't be in any misunderstanding Jagmohan-ji. I am not a big officer in the office. I am the head clerk of the office. He must have lied about my son also. That he is the engineer or a big.. ..officer in AV electrical in Kanpur. Yes, he was saying something like that. That is a complete lie. He is the junior clerk in that company. And this is my daughter Basanti. She has completed her B.A this year. That's all one son and one daughter. After that did you agree to the red triangle? No, the God showed the red flag. My wife passed away before time. I am very sad to hear that. Anyway, leave my sadness. And tell me who all are there in your family. Before telling that if we will have.. ..some snacks, how will that be? That will be very good. Even if the guests forget. But he never forgets about the snacks. I have given only four plates. Give it only to the guests. Don't even let him touch the plate. Even I will see that what he will do? Mother-in-law, father-in-law has.. ..the intelligence of a head clerk. He will surely think of something. At the right time everything happens right. Take it dear take it. The sweets of this house are very good. Jagmohan Das-ji take it. Give it daughter-in-law give. Dear Pundit-ji has been coming.. ..in this house for so many years. Don't you know that he has Sugar problems? If he will have sweets he will die. The sweet is very tasty. Dear you have made it, bring some more. Jagmohan-ji, known I will introduce you to my family. Godavari, Godavari, Godavari. This is my.. - I understood. The lovingly you called her for the first time. And she came and stood here. She is none other than your wife. Greetings Bhabhi-ji. Wow! Your intelligence should be praised. Sharma-ji, you are making me shy by praising me. Jagmohan-ji. Actually Godavari.. ..is the one who should be praised. She is not fond of eating herself. But she gets happiness in feeding others. Especially me. What a delicious sweet she has prepared. This is Vijay, my elder son. He never lost in life. He has always won. He has now become a chartered accountant. Greetings. - Bless you, bless you. This is my other son Shiva. His work is just like his name. He can even give his life for others. He is a mechanic in United Motors. Greetings. - Bless you. Jagmohan-ji, this is the result of my life's biggest mistake. His name is Vidya Sagar. Wow Sir, EeshwarChand VidyaSagar. He was a very learned person. Yes and all my life l will keep regretting. That I have given that great persons name to this donkey. Why? What does he do? He is studying in high school. He has been studying in high school. And he will keep studying in high school. I understood, I understood. Actually he is making his base strong. He is making my base weak. Yes I understood, I understood. That who is neighing like a horse, her name is Gangu Bai. Father had brought him from Kanpur. Her tongue works more than her hands. By the way she is not the servant of this house. She is the part of our family. Greetings. Now I will introduce to that member of the family. Who not only rules the house but also our hearts. Really, who is this great person? Come dear, come. This is our elder daughter-in-law. - Greetings. Her name is Uma. She is the light of our house. Dear give me some sweets. Nothing happens without here permission Jagmohan-ji. Dear give me some sweets. Even though she is the daughter-in-law. I call her my daughter. Dear.. - Give him some sweets dear. - Yes. Not me dear to Sharma-ji. Father do you have a coin? - Why? I want to toss it see if I will be able.. ..to see the girl today or not. Why no, why not. Uma, bring Rajni. Come dear, come. Sit here. This is my daughter Rajni. Either the name is Rajni or Rajnigandha. I have no interest in her scent. Please tell her to sing a song. - Song. You want me to sing a song? Yes, do you know how to sing? Please sing. Son there is only one song in our.. ..family that we have got as an inheritance. Whenever some one comes to see the girl. She has sung this song. My grandma had sung this song.. ..to my grandpa and married her. And even my mother had sung this song to my father. And even my wife sung this song to me and married me. And even my elder daughter-in-law.. I understood. Dear, even you sing the same song to him. Look Rajni, I don't like your dancing at all. Then? - Come out of the foreigner's.. ..country and come into our country. Sing a tune that has the scent love.. ..and sweetness of our country. The same old tune. Why don't you say it clearly? That you don't like new age music. You like those old tunes. The older the music grows the younger it becomes. I love these isolated places where.. ..only you and me are there. You wearing a sari just like this. And by adorning your forehead. By becoming even more beautiful than this scenery. Stand before me just like this. And there should be such a song on your lips. That I should fall in love with you again. " Radharani is dancing on the shores of Jamuna." " Radharani is dancing on the shores of Jamuna." " lnstead of the pot in the two eyes of her." " lnstead of the pot in the two eyes of her." " lnstead of the pot in the two eyes of her." "She has filled tears." " Radharani is dancing on the shores of Jamuna." " Radharani is dancing on the shores of Jamuna." "On the shores of the Jamuna." "On the shores of the Jamuna." "This innocent age of yours." "The veil is slipping of your head." "This innocent age of yours." "The veil is slipping of your head." "Think before you do anything." "The path of love is very narrow." "The path of love is very narrow." " And your body is very gentle." " Radharani is dancing on the shores of Jamuna." " Your friends are watching you." " And due to the shyness your eyes." " Your friends are watching you." " And due to the shyness your eyes." " has become the tale of your love," " Why did you frame in your heart?" " Why did you frame on your heart?" "The photo of Mohan." " Radharani is dancing on the shores of Jamuna." " Radharani is dancing on the shores of Jamuna." "The first thing that the people will do." "The will defame your name." "The first thing that the people will do." "The will defame your name." "They will blame you for it." " Hide this in your heart." " Hide this in your heart." "The love of your life." " Radharani is dancing on the shores of Jamuna." " Radharani is dancing on the shores of Jamuna." " Radharani is dancing on the shores of Jamuna." " Radharani don't go on the shores of Jamuna." "On the shores of the Jamuna." "On the shores of the Jamuna." Please stop, please stop, please stop. I liked your song very much. I even liked you very much. I am ready to marry you. I will not take even single money in dowry. But you will have to promise me some thing. That you will never sing a song to me ever again. Well done dear. Okay sir, we will leave now. The remaining things I will let you know in ten days time. Sit down Pundit-ji. If you have to take a decision then why not now. I don't have the habit of stretching matters like rubber. Tell me son, what do you think? When the elders are present then what can I say. Son the decision is yours in this matter. When you people are present here father. Then how can I take a decision? This is not the question of minute or two minute. This is the question of your whole life. Tell me clearly, if you like the girl or not. I like her father I like her. You should understand my indication. I understood son I very well understood it. Pundit-ji. - Yes. - Just see which.. ..will be the best date for marriage. - Yes, yes. What are you saying daughter? Why? Did you not understand what I just said? But Rajni, why didn't you like that boy. Before this three grooms have seen me. And all the three had rejected me. Did I go and ask them the reason. The likes and dislikes of the bride.. ..hold no importance Rajni. Because their fate is decided by their parents. Just look at me, I married your brother quietly. Bhabhi, you are from the village.. ..and I am from the town. You are S.S.C and I am B.Sc. I will take the decision of my life myself. Now will you go and tell everyone.. ..about my decision or shall l! No, you wait here I will go and talk to them. Sir, the 13th of this March is very auspicious,.. .. after that there is no other better date. Father-in-law, just come inside for a minute. Just a minute dear, we are deciding.. ..on the date of the marriage. The date will not go anywhere father-in-law. But at this time it is very important.. ..for you to come inside. Vijay, you decide the date of the marriage with the guests. I will just come. Shiva, you just sit with them I will just come. VidyaSagar, you discuss it with.. ..the guests I will just come. You discuss it among yourselves. I will just come. Wait young man sit here. If even you will go inside then whom will we discuss it with? If I don't like the groom, then I don't like him. I don't want to tell you the reason. Look dear, if we have made decision regarding you. Then we have done it for your good future. Even I have taken my decision for my better future. I have to marry not you! I have said it clearly! I don't like that groom. I don't like that groom at all! - Shut up. - Vijay. Do you think that you are very beautiful? That you don't like a very good groom like him. When she has said clearly that.. ..she does not like the groom. Then forcibly marrying here will.. ..be neither good for their family nor ours. I will just go and talk to them. Jagmohan-ji, as it is my daughter.. ..is ready for the marriage. She says wants wait for five or six.. ..months before the marriage.. Vidya, they left. - Yes father. They left the minute they heard everything. I am just coming. Daughter Vasanti. - What is it father? I am going to the shop. And I will go to the market from there. I will not be able to come for lunch in the afternoon. Greetings Jagmohan-ji. You, why are you standing at the door. Come, come in. Come in please. I will set foot inside your house.. ..only when you will forgive me. What are you saying? Come in come in. Come sit, sit. Now tell me, what mistake have you made. For which you are asking for forgiveness from me. Jagmohan-ji, you were insulterd.. ..in my house because of my daughter. When I think about that I feel like.. ..that somebody has insulted me. Deendayal-ji, you know that I have a small cloth shop. Everyday many customers come. They see each cloth very finely. What they like they take along with them. And what they don't like they leave it behind. My son is the bad cloth that has.. ..not been selected by your daughter. That does not mean that he is of cheap quality. And there is no value of him in the market. I liked your home and your family very much. But I am sad that we did come close to each other. But we could not become relatives. The difference between you and me is that. You could say all this and I don't.. ..even have the courage to say it. Vasanti dear. - Yes Father. Is there sweets made of semolina in the house? Bring it, Mr. Deendayal likes it very much. The Suji Halva! Wow! There must be sweets at least, bring that. There must be jaggery bring that. - Okay father. All this for what Jagmohan-ji? I will tell you. Dear bring it quickly. Keep I here. All good things should be started with sweets. I want ask your son Shiva's hand for my daughter Vasanti. Do you accept this proposal? Look, I don't have to ask my daughter.. ..for taking this decision. I have nurtured my daughter such that. She will marry anyone I will choose for her. Did I hurt you? Just like you are praising your daughter. Even I can praise my son Shiva like that. That whichever girl l will tell him to marry. He will marry that girl. I did not tell this to hurt you. I tried to soothe the pain that you just gave me. Jagmohan-ji, I accept this proposal. - DeenDayal-ji. Then this marriage should take.. ..place as soon as possible. I have a condition. Until I will not find a groom for my daughter. I will not get Shiva married. It is okay with me. - Thank you. Okay dear see you. - Okay. Where will you meet me tomorrow? Wherever you say. Borivali National Park. - Okay. Bye, see you. I have just alighted from a strangers.. ..motor cycle in front of your doorstep. And you didn't even ask who he was. You didn't even try to find out that.. ..what is relation between him and me. I wanted to know. But I did not want to ask. Because I was afraid that my house would be defamed. You have the right to ask me. You are my father. Really, I am your father. After seeing all this I had completely forgotten that. I wanted to talk to you about my marriage. Oh, are you already married or are you going to marry? How could you even think that I would.. ..marry even without telling you? I am really happy to know that dear. I thought that I would have to search for a son-in-law myself. But you have made my work easier. Now I just have to give permission to your decision. Okay, I will even do that. After all I am your father. Come we will consult the others also. Come. Vijay, daughter-in-law, come here. Godavari. Shiva. VidyaSagar. All of you come here. All you must be surprised to see. That why have I called all the family members here together. That is because that all of you are a part of this family. And a very important part of this family is Rajni. She has decided to get married. I expect your help in this marriage. Where the marriage will take place. What all clothes and jewellery will be made in the marriage? What food will be made in the marriage? I will need your advice in all these issues. But if some one dares to ask me that who is the groom. Than no one will be worse than me. Because Rajni-ji has chosen the groom herself. What are you saying? Father is telling the truth mother. He works in the office with me. And before coming here I have.. ..met his father and decided everything. He is ready for our marriage. What is the name of the groom, daughter? Peter Fernandes. - What? There's nothing to be shocked about. When shamelessness crosses its limit, this is what happens. Rajni, the boy is Christian. No he's an lndian. What are you about to do Rajni? He's a Christian and you know that your Father.. ..is a pure Brahman. Bhabhi, when Father isn't telling me anything you.. ..don't have to give your opinion. I' m the daughter of this house. You came over here after your marriage. When my family members aren't telling me anything.. ..you don't interfere in my life. Mom, I am going to the Union Office. I will be back after sometime. At this critical stage, instead of giving your opinion.. ..you' re walking to the Union Office. When Bhabhi is told not to interfere in this issue then l.. ..don't care for any of the marriage.. ..taking place in this house. Father - Yes Shiva. If you' re agreeing to this marriage then tell me.. ..how much money do I need to chip in. Because I have to give an ARJl to the company for the loans. That means you' re ready to pay for your sisters marriage. Not for my sister. I am ready to ease the pressure on my father. No. I will never accept this marriage. Mother, only your blessings are welcome, but not your decision. That means you will elope with that boy if we say no? Those who are not confident of themselves elope. Itis sufficient for me to go to St. Mathews Church and.. ..changed the rings and marry him.. ..or going to the registrar office and make him my husband.. ..Iegally with just a signature of mine. ..or go to lord Shankaris temple and marry him by exchanging the garlands. Father, Rajini is.. Daughter-in-law, the bus no. 1 and bus no. 3.. ..goes to St. Mathews Church. And the bus no. 10 goes to the registrar office. And for Lord Shankaris isnit there nearby our house. Am I right? What are you saying, father! You want Rajini to marry a Christian boy? Donit say anything, daughter-in-law. When my daughter has decided that her father.. ..doesnit have the capability.. ..to look for a bridegroom for her. ..then how does it make a difference if the groomis name is Pitamber.. ..or Peter Fernandes or Peer Mohammad. Itis does make a difference to me. Why would it make a difference to me? Why are you standing silently? You are the eldest son of this house. Why donit you go and talk to Rajini? Go. Rajni, you' re marrying on your wish and not on ours. So listen to this carefully. You have to wear the same sari which you' re.. ..wearing now when you will leave this house. Because none of us will pay a single penny for your marriage. I don't need any help from anyone in this house, Thank you very much. - Mention not. Oh god. What's happening? What's happened to you? You' re telling your sister to wear the.. ..same sari and leave the house. If you don't like this marriage then tell her that.. ..if she does that you will kill her. And if you cant do this then do all the rituals and.. ..send her happily to her home. But you left both this option and chose the third option. With that you will be free from your sister and.. ..the money for the marriage will be saved. This is the correct thing which I am doing. Why should we suffer when she is doing something wrong. I won't spend a single penny. She is announcing her decision openly in front of everyone. These kinds of girls should be thrown out of the house. I understand that it's natural for you to get angry. But if Shiva is ready to help Father then.. ..why are you doing this? You give according to your budget. I will speak to Father about meeting the guy's father. Uma, she will always interfere in others life. She welcomes problems. She will take the burden on.. ..her head and then this fool has to carry it. Mr. Deendayal, I believe in all communities. But I don't believe in caste and creed. The child in the womb doesn't belong to any community. He has no caste. In Godis eyeis everyone is same. The only difference is that we lit candles in the church.. ..and you lit Diye in the temple. You say Om and we say Amen. Kids of every religion stay nine months in their mothersi wombs. And after death every human being needs the six feet.. ..space under the ground. You can burn him or bury him. You' re right Mr. Albert. But my intension was to tell you.. ..that my daughter knows nothing about your community. Tell me one thing. Which girl on this earth will be aware of the custom.. ..and manners of his husband's house? Before the marriage I wanted to tell you the.. ..weakness of my daughter. She gets angry very soon. She is unaware of what she says in rage. Then we will forgive her and forget. Don't worry Mr. Deendayal. If she can't change for us then we will change for her. Thank you very much. By telling whatever was there in my mind and.. ..Iistening to your answer I am tension free. Thank you very much Ulaberd. Uma. Listen. Listen. - What happened? - You' re going to be Grandfather. What? Grandma, Grandpa. Oh Godavari. What a news you've given! " I am very happy today. I am very happy today." " Don't ask why but l am very happy today." " I am very happy today." " Listening to the news I feel like doing something." " I am very happy today. I am very happy today." "The heart is beating fast. Tell whether it's a boy or a girl." "Tell. Please tell." " You' re sweating in embarrassment." "Tell me which month is going on." " Her anger is seen on her face and there she abuses." " A flower has blossomed. So please don't hide it." "So this beautiful smell won't be able to hide." " What you were about to whisper, please say it aloud." " I am very happy today. I am very happy today." "There is something wrong." " Look there is something wrong." "Something will happen for sure." "The black crow on the roof is saying that.. ..someone's going to come in the house." " Bhabhi has held the stick." "The cold water has gone hot." " A different thing has happened." " Every chicken gives an egg." You have failed once again. Brother, please leave me. Today, I won't leave you. Shiva what are you doing? Will you kill him? What has he done? Bhabhi, he has failed once again. What? The entire family works hard. Everyone hopes that heill study well. But he doesn't seem to be affected by all that. Father expects a lot from him. But he has ruined all his dreams. What are you doing? Listen.. Please forgive me daddy? You didn't let your father eat the food. You will neither let us live happily nor let us die properly. You have become shameless by the daily taunts. But why are you spoiling our dignity in the colony. Useless. Why were you born? Brother. Bhabhi. Why didn't I die? Why didn't I die? Vidya, what are you doing? At least you forgive me, Babhi. I will forgive you. But you have to promise something. You will pay attention towards your studies. Yes Bhabhi. I promise you that I will work hard and pass. All right. Now stop crying. Lakshmi listen. - Yes. All the work is done? - Yes. It's too late. You leave now. You didn't eat your food. I' m not hungry. I will eat later. You go. Rajni. Rajni. Daddy, you didn't eat your lunch. I am sorry. I was late in the office. Where is Rajni? Okay Rajni. I will take a leave. Good night. Peter you' re a literate person. Is this your manner? Even you' re literate. Are these manners to stay in a house? I wasn't dancing in the middle of the road. I was learning dance in my own bed room and.. ..that to with a lady teacher. You' re a married woman. Do you still need to wear these kinds of clothes? Donit be silly. You are born in a broad-minded Christian family. Being broad-minded doesnit mean that we will tolerate anything. I am a true Christian and for me my home is my Church. I had told you from the office that I will be.. ..coming late from the office. ..and told you to serve the meals at time. I told Lakshmi to serve the food to Daddy. Oh you mad girl. There is a difference between.. ..daughter-in-law and a maid. Listen to me. Change these clothes and wear a sari. I want the same Rajni which I had loved. Let's go. For filtering - For filtering. And destroying - And destroying. Disease causing germs. One minute Bhabhi. You' re feeling sleepy Vidya. Go and sleep. We will study the rest tomorrow. What are you saying Bhabhi? I don't want to take a risk this time. I will work hard and l will pass this time. You are not there in the morning. Tell me. That's not the issue Vidya. Your Brother has completed his night shift.. ..and he needs rest after that. Bhabhi, what is the relation between my.. ..studies and brothers rest. Your brother has arrived. Vidyasagar is still studying. Keep it up. Did you see Bhabhi? Brother praised me looking at me studying. Bhabhi, you come fast. I need answer for some question. I will send your Bhabhi in some time. Let me get refreshed. Whatis the matter today? Instead of getting fresh at the well you came are.. ..getting fresh in the bathroom. You didnit get me? This Vidhyasagar has put us in the trouble. I have to teach him all the day. We are newly married, but see what is.. Then letis meet in the morning. In the morning? How can I meet you in front of everyone! My life has become very dull. Darling, donit worry at all! Open it. Open it. Sister-in-law. What are you both doing here? I am getting fresh. - If you are getting fresh then go to the well. Vidhya, the thing is that I came so late and tired.. ..thatis why I didnit go to the well. - I see. Sister-in-law, what does encyclopedia means? Yes, it is something related to the cycle. Itis not about cycle, what encyclopedia means is.. Ok. Ok. Go and teach him. Go and teach him. Go. Sister-in-law, what does troublemaker means? Vidhyasagar. - Hey, go and teach him. Go. Go. May all the evil eyes shall destroy! May all the evil eyes shall destroy! - Gangubai.. ..how long will you do this cast off. Once we do it perfectly then no evil eye will trouble you. I should get your letter in every two days in Bombay. Or else I will catch a train and will be back. Why are you worried daughter-in-law? Every daughter goes to her parent's house fir her first child. You shouldn't worry. No I am not worried. But I think that you' re very worried. I am worried. I am not worried. I am waiting for the day when you will bring a.. ..cute grandson in this house. And that grandson will play with me. Why? If it's a Granddaughter, won't you play with her? I have an X-ray machine in place of my eyes. I can tell you that I will play with a grandson. A grandson. Oh father. Vidya, listen. Please don't waste your time. Work hard and study well. Understand. Understood Bhabhi. But please return before the exams. On one side there will be my efforts and on the other.. ..there will be your blessings. After this I will see who will fail me. All right. I will be back. Basanti, I should hear a good news from you too.. ..when I will be back. What good news, sister-in-law? Shut up! You wonit understand it. Sister, I wish he would have understood it. Bhabhi. What is this Shiva? For the first time I am seeing a mark on your forehead. Did you visit a temple? Yes Bhabhi. I went to the temple. I went to pray for a lovely nephew. Take these blessings. Where is he from such a long time? Tell me dear; isn't a passenger accompanied by his luggage? I won't give you an extra single penny except.. ..what the meter says. Sir, at least give 2 rupees extra. You move on. What are you doing? We are going for a sacred work. Give him 2 rupees extra. Please give him. We' ll give you. Let's go. You generous daughter! Do you know how.. ..is this money earned? You sit inside daughter-in-law. Vijay, you aren't intelligent if you always.. .. worry about money. Sir. How will a pregnant woman travel in this motor? Didn't you get a taxi? You keep quiet. It takes 1 2rupees in scooter for station. And it takes 40 rupees in taxi for the same. Do you know that? All right. Please don't argue now. Sit inside daughter. Sit Uma. Sister, please bring a beautiful son like you. But not like Sir. He is always worried about his money. Please come fast. Please come fast. Thank you very much. Good night. - Good night. Bye. Hello Daddy. Did Peter give a call from Delhi? Yes. He gave a call. He will be back by tonight's flight. Thank you. Good night Daddy. One minute. Peter asked about you on the phone. I told him that you haven't reached yet. It was 8:00 at that time. Its 1 1 :00 now. Your office is over by 5:00. Where were you after that? There was a marriage anniversary of.. ..one of my colleague. I was in that party. Okay. Did you wear this in your office? No. I was wearing sari in the office. But I took a parcel of this dress along with me. That means you knew that you have to attend.. ..a party in the evening. You could have told me. But you didn't find that important. You could have at least informed the maid. But you didn't find that also important. Who was the man who dropped you right now? Daddy I just want to say that I am a fire in every thing. Very good. But if the person who dropped you would be.. ..burnt if he is cotton Daddy, he's a colleague who works with me in the office. I have travelled with him for a lot of time. And Peter knows about this. But does Peter know anything about where you came from? Look. Peter is the rider and you' re sitting behind. If you shake little bit also, then the vehicle.. ..will loose its balance. Vehicles in the context of life over here. The vehicle of our life will move steadily. It' ll loose its balance only if an old black cat will pass our way. By the way, old cat over her wasn't you. Hi Dad. My Delhi trip was extremely successful. What happened to you Dad? What's the matter? Nothing my son. Vidya's study is over. Are you the only one in the house who should care.. ..for your brother's good performance in his exams? What are you speaking? Everyone in the house is worried about his results. Did your elder brother ever ask about his studies? Did he ever tell him to come in his room and study.. ..since Bhabhi isn't present? Did he ever help him in his studies? Tell me. Your motive behind this question is Vidya's studies.. ..or physical relation with me. Look, Rajini, I am telling this to you for the last time. I donit doubt you at all. But I donit you to do anything that people would talk.. ..about you in a wrong way. I thought that you will treat my father as God. But you arenit treating him as even an ordinary human being. You went on dinner last night. It was not your mistake. But you didnit inform father before leaving and.. ..that was definitely a mistake. You came with Saxena on scooter. I donit have any problem with that. But you returned at 1 1 Oi clock. That was definitely your mistake. Have you ever realized that we arenit married since 60 years.. ..but itis been just six months. And in these six months even didnit even.. ..spend six nights together. Peter, there is no one in my life except you. This doesn't mean that l' m your slave. In didn't get freedom in my own house. I married you thinking that I will get the freedom which I want. I broke the shackles of my house and married you. But I was wrong. I was a slave in my house and over here too. I can't be a daughter-in-law of a rich family.. ..and act like a slave. What? What are you saying Godavari? I am telling you the fact. I searched everywhere.. ..in the house but couldn't find Basanti. Shiva. - Yes. Did you send daughter-in-law somewhere? Did you people quarrel? Why aren't you speaking? Basanti is nowhere in the house. Why are you quiet? All right. Godavari, I will search her. What's this? Rajni is coming all alone. What happened dear? You are alone with your belongings. I will stay over here forever. What nonsense are you speaking daughter? I didn't like him. Whom didn't you like? The servant of your house. No. Peter. Rajni. Respect your husband. He has tied a knot with you. She just exchanged her ring with that man. The respect for ring is fulfilled if a girl is engaged.. ..in a pure relation with her husband. But when the girl doesn't get the status of a wife then.. ..these things become normal jewellery. It becomes a drama. I have no faith in these superstitions. We are in a big mess. What do we do now? I can't understand whom to think about? About my daughter who was to handle her family.. ..but came back for no reason. Or do I think about the one who came to bring a.. ..Iight of happiness but without telling anyone.. ..she has left us in darkness. Father, you think about sending back your daughter. I will bring my wife back at home. You must be thinking, why hasn't your father.. ..asked anything and also about you being back. I won't ask. To interfere in their household matters won't be appropriate. Then whom do I say my tragedy. The one whom you married in front of the fire. If the problem is created by him then? Then you should ask your Father. That's why I came over here. I think you are unaware. I' m not your father now. The day you were married l was no longer your father. Deendayal is your father now. Without informing and permission from.. ..anyone you can't stay over here. You can remove me from this house but you don't have.. ..the right to tell me to go back to their house. I can stay in a hotel or anywhere. But don't tell after this that your dignity is hurt. I spoilt your respect. Where are you going? Either a river or well. Or a place where you will get freedom. I don't have the guts to stay in freedom. I am not even a coward to jump in a river and kill myself. I' ll search for the solution of my problems. But where are you going? I am going to my husband's house. Very good daughter. This is the only way a married woman can achieve happiness. If you want I can help you? I don't need your happiness. That's very good. Why did you stop? Did you change your plan? Shiva. How are you? - Greetings father. Father I was carefully listening to what you were saying. If you were listening carefully then try to understand. You work in a garage so I will explain you in your terms. If the engine of the car is spoilt then you repair its spare parts. If the engine of the car is fine then the car will run smoothly. Father, you have a shop of clothes. I will explain you in those terms. - Explain. If I buy clothes from your shop, then I can.. ..cut it in any way so that I can wear it. But I wont return the same clothes to the shopkeeper. Very good, son. We have understood each other. We will leave now. Let's go. The way your son has gone to persuade her wife.. ..the same way Peter will come over here. I know these men very well. Why are you quiet daddy? This ship which we call as a house is sinking. The cracks in this ship needs to be repaired. And what if you can't repair it? Then you have to save yourself from it. How do I save myself? I am the captain of this ship. Those who know how to swim save themselves.. ..before the ship sinks. - Yes my son. When the ship is about to sink its rats who run away first. You' re a literate girl. But now I understand that you have just read books. You know nothing about this worldliness. If you need a husband then you have to wait for a while. A husband-wife relationship is not only a physical relation. Sometime we need to compromise.. ..according to the situation. No one should know what happened between us. You go to house and I will be back from the Union Office. This is the months spend. Keep it in the temple. Mother, count the money and keep it yourself. I have never counted the money. It will be the correct amount. But still Mom. Just count it. What's this Vijay? Its only 400 rupees. I used to give 800 rupees for both of us. Since Uma is gone to Bombay, I am giving only my share. Vijay you' re the eldest son of this house. If you do this what will be the situation of the house? Mom, in today's world we need to keep a track of our money. You should have been in my womb for 9 months.. ..but you took 9 months and 20 days. I didn't leave you after that thinking that my work is over. Very good, Godavari. Very good. For the first time.. ..you delivered an intelligent statement after marriage. May I know what Mom said that made you feel so happy? I will explain it to you my son. We feed the cow so that it will give milk. But if the same cow starts making a deal then.. ..what will happen to the milkman? I' m sorry to say that you haven't treated me as.. ..a cow but as a bullock who has to carry the.. ..burden on his shoulders. Until when will I carry this burden? Even I have my responsibilities, my family. I will be having a child within some days. I cant waste my money like this Daddy. Very good son. Spending money on Mother.. ..father, brother, sister is a waste of money. Yes? Yes. Am I the only one who has to remember.. ..duty and advices? Being an elder brother I should.. ..spend on my younger sister's marriage. And the younger sister has left her in-laws and.. ..now staying over here. She has left her job also. But that's not her mistake. No one will ask her anything. But Daddy, I have to pay for all what she eats. This is not justice. I have neither told anyone to help me in my marriage nor.. ..did I ask anyone to feed me over here. Daddy if you don't like me staying over here.. ..then I can stay in a hotel. Yes. Girls like you can stay in a hotel. You will do a lot of things with this ego of yours and I know it. Vijay. You' re forgetting that Rajni is your own sister. This is not what I say Daddy. But this is what her husband and father-in-law were.. ..telling that she used to roam around with men's late at night. You' re not explaining her. Instead you' re pinpointing at my mistake. This is too much Vijay. You've no right to say anything to my daughter. Leave this house immediately. - All right Mom. I will go. Until now when I obeyed you, I was your eldest son. But when I told the fact you all felt bad. This girl who came to live over here happily when she left.. ..the house without informing anyone you all suspected her. Vijay, you can say anything about your sister but you've.. ..no right to say anything about your brothers wife. Especially when Shiva isn't present at home. Daddy, why is this strange behaviour with me? Why don't I get the respect what Shiva gets in this house? I am elder to him. He earns just 525 rupees. I earn 1725 rupees. 1725 rupees. Is it? - Yes. - Daughter-in-law, come inside. A person who earns 525 rupees quietly.. ..gives 450 rupees in the house. And the one who earns 1725 chips 400 rupees. That's the difference. What a stupid argument? - That's what you think. If I would have provided Shiva the same education like.. ..you then he would have been earning well. Did I tell you do that with Shiva? No. no one said anything. I couldn't provide education to both of you because.. ..at that time I wasn't earning well. To send you college I made him work in the garage. To see you in convocational clothes I made.. ..him wear hand-woven cloth. To see your degree, I gave him a cutting plyer. Shiva is invaluable. The one who can't understand him is a fool. What are you speaking? If he would have studied are you sure.. ..he would have excelled? This Vidyasagar is also studying. What's the result? Brother, this time I will pass. Every time you say that you will pass and every time you fail. You are very smart brother Vijay. From a long time l' m listening nonsense about your father. Today son helps his father in every respect and.. ..Iessens his burden. But in turn you' re blaming your father. Don't speak too much. Go and do your work. Will Rajni go back to her house if you give 400 less? Will Basanti's mistake be forgiven.. ..will Vidyasagar pass in his exam? Daddy - This is too much. Elder son is giving tension due for his money. All the other children give some or the other tension. I am hurt badly. Godavari, return him the 400 rupees which he gave you. We will feed him for free in compensation.. ..for giving him birth. I' m not from those who will eat for free nor that foolish.. ..that I will waste my money for someone else. Mr. Vijay Kumar Sharma, do you know whom.. ..are you speaking to? Yes. I very well know whom I am speaking to. I' m speaking to a person whose backbone is broken. The one who can't improve his children's mistake. The one who can't structure his house properly. I' m speaking to a very weak and old man. You at least know that this old man has given you birth. He has carried the burden of the house on.. ..the same backbone. On the office table, before the bending of the backbone.. ..it was me because of whom you got the degree MCom. I don't know all this. Don't you know that l paid 20000 rupees for.. ..your job in the company? And for that I kept my provident fund and gratuity on mortgage. Don't you remember the one who did so much for you? Don't you know the officer Deendayal who.. ..works in the government office? - I don't know. Once you were badly injured in a bus accident and.. ..you were fighting for your life. At that same time.. ..this father of yours donated 3 bottles of blood. Don't you know this much also? - No, I don't know. I don't know. You useless, dog. You've no right to live in this house. Get out of this house right now. Mr. Deendayal Sharma. I had taken a loan of 18000 from the office for the marriage. The day I get my money properly, I will leave this house. Godavari, you draw a line in between the house. This line should be much powerful than.. ..the line which Laxman drew for Sita. Mr. Vijay Kumar Sharma, there is no need for something.. ..strong to compensate with the broken hearts. We just need a straight line. I swear on my late Mother that neither me, my children.. ..my wife will cross this line nor you will cross this line.. ..and come to the other side. I will return your 18000 which you gave for.. ..the marriage within a year. Even if I have to keep myself on mortgage. In case I die in between please don't see my dead body.. ..don't put fire on me and just don't come. Now get lost. " Look at it. This is the world." "This is the world. Look at it. This is the world" " Look at it. This is the world." " lts selfish and a friend of money." " Look at it. This is the world." " What a story of happiness, what a story of sorrow." "The life of a man is like a game of chess." " Look at it. This is the world. This is the world." " Look at it. This is the world." " When a son is escaping from his duty.. ..his father felt as if he's lost a hand." " Mothers heart is broken and she is distorted." " And in this way the house is divided in two halves." " Where there was love now there's a wall of hatred." " Look at it. This is the world. This is the world." " Look at it. This is the world." Bhabhi, brother has arrived. Go and open the door. Even you' re his brother. You are awake too. You open the door. All right. I had ringed the bell. Didn't you hear it? - I did hear. Then why did you disturb the one who is studying? Why? If your brother did so did he get bruises in his legs? What is this? You didn't wash my loincloth. No! - Why? - I forgot. - I forgot? He's studying late at night. Did you make coffee or tea for him? No - Why? I don't know how to prepare it. Basanti, I want to speak to you personally. Please come on the back part of the house. I won't come anywhere. I' m feeling sleepy. Don't forget that l' m your husband and l' m calling you. Oh! You remember that you are my husband. But I've forgotten this long back. Good night. What happened? Why have you arrived with a garland over your neck? Godavari, a person in the office is gifted a.. ..garland when he's free from the job. So, you' re retired? But you are only 53. Who are they to retire me. I retired myself. Voluntary retirement! And I took this retirement because the son.. ..whom I gave birth, sheltered him needs his 18000 rupees. Where will I bring such a huge amount from? My savings is my provident fund and gratuity. That I will get only after my retirement. That's why I told the office people to retire me. But you lost your 5 years of service. When I lost the pride which I saved for 53 years. When I lost the son whom I nurtured for 33 years. Then it doesn't matter if you lose a job of 5 years. Its okay if its gone. Shiva, a servant never takes a back seat if he losses a job. I have arranged for another job. From morning 7 to 1, I will take care of the accounts.. ..in Pannalal's shop. I will get 250 rupees. Then from 2 to 5 I will work on my provident fund and gratuity. It's a government related matter and it will take time. Sometime a person passes away and.. ..he gets his pay after his death. After that, from 10 to morning 5, I will be.. ..a watchman in Gandhi colony. If you get a job for me from 6 to 9 then let me know. Father, isn't your responsibility mine? You leave it to me. I will work and return all his money. May you prosper in your life, my son. But your brother has taught me a lesson that you.. ..shouldn't believe your son too in this world. I will work on my own. Father, do you know the consequences if.. ..you work so much at this age? Result? I will die, that's it. That will also be good for this home in some ways. After that you will get the money of life insurance. All the money will be paid at once. What was the hurry in coming back so soon? You should have come after three or four months. Received a telegram and you came. Mother-in-law had said to come soon.. ..along with your son. Anyway, tell me how is mother-in-law and father-in-law? For so long they have not written any letter to me. And even the letter that you sent me.. ..You did not tell me about their well being. We are going home. We will go there and talk. Listen, is there any good news from Rajni and Basanti. We will go home and talk. Okay, at least tell me is Vidya working hard this month. Will he pass this month I said we will go home and talk! Okay Shiva.. Listen, brother, it is raining heavily in Mumbai. Hasn't it started to rain here? Oh God! - What is the matter? Is your head paining? What will you take to shut your mouth? Look, my dear, our house has come. You can do all this even inside the house.. ..get down, the meter is increasing. Did you hear? Even you learn from him. Come in. - How can I go inside like that? I have arrived with the future of this family for first time. You go inside and tell mother-in-law. She will first welcome him.. ..and do the veneration to remove the evil eye.. ..cast on him, and then we will come inside. There is no veneration here, nor will anyone welcome you here. Now we have no relations with mother and father. There has been division of the house. You see this line. This is the mark of division. If you even mistakenly step.. ..your foot on that side of the line. Then you will see my dead face! Mr. Deendayal Sharma, I had taken a loan of 18, 000.. ..rupees from the office for the marriage. The day you will return that amount.. ..to me with the interest I will leave your house. I have taken my bath. Serve me lunch now. Uma. Uma. Why are you standing here? Come inside. Come. All this has happened when you were not present here. How I have separated my self from them.. ..that only I know. But if you try to regain the relationship again.. ..than no one will be worse than me. I am going to the office. There is a lot of work. I maybe late. Try to understand. Smile. What kind of a mother is she.. ..the child is crying away and she is sleeping soundly? "Sleep, sleep, be quiet, sleep." "Sleep, sleep." " Who are you trying to call by crying, my child?" " All the people of this house have forgotten you." " Who are you trying to call by crying my, child?" " All the people of this house have forgotten you." "Sleep, sleep, be quiet, sleep." " You are the full moon of the dark night." " You are the flower of the autumn." "This is your mistake, why will anyone will remember you?" " You are the star of my eyes." " Who are you trying to call by crying, my child?" "The cradle has broken." "The thread has broken." "The child is crying, the mother is crying." " Who will sing the lullaby?" "Come, let us cry together on our misfortune." " Who are you trying to call by crying my, child?" " For some people, money is so dear." " For some people money is so dear." "There is a division of everything in this world." " In this house even the love has been divided." " Who are you trying to call by crying, my child?" " All the people of this house have forgotten you." "Sleep, sleep, be quiet, sleep." "Sleep, sleep, be quiet, sleep." 'Oh Goddess Tulsi, before we used to walk around you.' ' But now we turn around on the spot.' ' Please forgive us.' Why are you doing all this work? Give it to me, I will do it. After the delivery, the body of.. ..a woman becomes very weak. Let it be Gangu-bai, if I will think about the weakness. Then how will I do the household chores? Now that I have become an orphan. Daughter-in-law, Daughter-in-law. The time when you called yourself an orphan. My heart just skipped a beat. May anyone take care of you or not.. ..I am still there for you. Here look, I have brought this for you from my house. These are sweets made especially with dry fruits. You will be strong again after eating this. Here take this. I have made this in my own house. In my own house. - Is it? - Yes. You made these sweets in your own house? Than how did it reach in mother-in-laws jar? The jar was in the house and the house was in the jar. And both of them went inside each other. Gangu-bai, what ingredients have you used in this? In this. - Yes. - In this. I used jaggery, flour, lentil. - And many more things! Yes, after taking all this l mixed them all properly and.. Gangu-bai, I know who has prepared these sweets. On hearing to me, this jar has crossed.. ..the line, and come here. The one who has sent these sweets.. ..go and tell her, that just like this.. ..even she will have to cross the line and come on this side. There is no need to tell her that. She has heard all this already. Every one is smart here. Greetings, sir, l am the laundry man. Tell me, what is the matter? I have come to ask for the payment.. ..of the clothes that l had washed last month. What is the amount? - The total is 68 rupees sir. Here take 34 rupees. - 34. And take the remaining 34 rupees from that side. And from the next month if you.. ..will not bring a separate bill for me. Then I will not give you single penny. - Yes, sir. Sir. - Yes. - Laundry man. - What does that mean? Laundry. - Meaning? The one who washes the clothes. Meaning? - Sir, the one who washes and.. ..irons the clothes, he is called a laundry man. Then say like that, what I can understand! What do you want? - Money. Then give me. - I will not give you, but you will give me. How much do I have to pay you? - 34 rupees. Have you brought the bill along? - Yes. Then read it out, which clothes have we had washed. On the 2nd four terrycloth pants.. ..and four terrycloth shirts. On the 9th, five terrycloth pants and five terrycloth shirts. On the 18th, six terrycloth pants and six terrycloth shirts. And the total comes to 68 rupees. The sir on that side has give 34 rupees of his share. And has said that remaining 34 rupees.. .. I should take from you. All the clothes you have counted.. ..that have only terrycloth pants and shirts. Isn't it? - Yes. Shiva. - According to the deal the.. ..union has done with owners of the company. The company has our uniforms washed. Vidya. - Father I have only three.. ..half pants and three shirts. I wash them at home. Godavari. - Do I wear pant and shirt? Did you hear what all of them said? - Yes, I have heard. And regarding me I have stopped.. ..wearing pants since 7th March 1968. Now go and ask him, if he is short of money.. ..then I can help him. But, because I don't trust anyone. He will have to give me in writing. And he will have to have it attested by two officers. If it is okay with it, then I can pay you the amount. Laundry man! - Yes. - Come here. - Coming. I am not used to take loans I am used to give loans. Did you hear what I said? - Yes, I heard. Here, take your 34 rupees and go from here. Uma, did you hear what my respected father is saying? I was hearing everything. It seemed like he has installed a loudspeaker in his throat. Am I the only one who wears clothes.. ..washed in the laundry? Yes, of course, even you know this. We used to wash our clothes in the house itself! But you are safe from one thing. - What? Look, you and your family live in the half portion of this house. If they send you a court notice.. ..and ask you for a rent of 500 rupees. Rent? 500 rupees? - Speak softly. If they will hear, then the court.. ..notice will come anytime. If you would have known about this earlier.. ..you would have never divided this house. Isn't it? Did you understand? I am telling you the truth, Uma. You are a great lady! If there was a daughter-in-law like you in every home.. ..then there will be no problem or trouble in that home! This life is like a car, Albert sir. If you drive it carefully, it will ride smoothly. But the first car that we have to bring on the right track.. ..is your daughter-in-law, Rajni. You think is it wise? If a married woman fights with her husband.. ..and comes and stays in her parents house.. ..then how insulting it is? The whole society looks down on her. - Correct. You are absolutely right. All right, just as you said, l will come to your house at 1 1. But what will I have to do after reaching there? All the drama, along with the dialogue, I have written in here. This is your copy.. ..I will have one copy with me. If you forget something in between. Then I will prompt you from behind. You just muster some courage, and come home once. Courage? Am I afraid of someone? Yes, but who will argue with me in your house? Will I have to do all this? Yes, Gangu-bai. Only you can do all this. Oh God, I cannot argue with him. First of all he is the relative of this house.. ..and he is such a big man! I start trembling with fear when I see him. Gangu-bai don't you wish the.. ..condition of this house to become better again? But then, I wish that! - Don't you wish that.. ..Rajni spend rest of her life with her husband? Oh God, I really want it! Then you will have to argue with Albert sir! You are really smart. You have involved me in this. Okay, now tell me, what will I have to do? I will cut that Albert Fernandez to pieces. Sir, lift your leg, lift your leg. Our group is on this side. Here. here. On that side is our opposite group. Start. Start. - What? - Start. Greetings. Listen, I am standing here next to the window. I will not move from here. - No, no. - Are you ready? Yes, yes you don't worry. I have memorized all the dialogues. - Okay. What do you think? Should I start? - Of course. Is there anyone in the house? Oh God, do you have eyes or not? Such a big woman is standing in front of you! And still you are asking that is there anyone in the house? I don't want to talk to you! I want Rajni, do you understand? She has not come yet. Sir, what are you uttering in English? I don't like the purr of the kitten at all. She has come! She has come! Sir, if you don't know Hindi.. ..then speak in Marathi, understand! It's you. Come, Please come. Doesn't anyone have manners in this house? Doesn't anyone care about the honour of the some one else? A married woman, has left her husbands house.. ..and is living here since so long! Don't you have decency to explain her and send her back home? He has come here to create trouble.. ..he has come on the right time.. ..when there is no man in the house.. ..and no policeman in the neighbourhood. Gangu-bai. - You keep quiet! If you don't give answers to people like this on their faces.. ..then their arrogance does not shatter. What? You called me arrogant? You must be feeling tired of standing and speaking. Please come in and take a seat. - Why are you calling him in? Listen one thing clearly, Albert Fernandez! - What? Listen one thing clearly! Our daughter will come at 10 or 12 or 14 in the night. You don't need to interfere about that! If our daughter wants, then she will not return the whole night! The women of this house have full freedom! And look at you! You doubted our daughter for such a small thing! Shame on you! Shame on you! Gangu-bai! - You keep quiet! This is the man who doubted you! He created such a big issue out of such a small thing. Hey Fernandez, gone. Gone. Those days are gone when men used to doubt women. Now if men will doubt women then.. ..we will catch him by the hair and throw them in the fire! Understand! - Gangu-bai. - Unless this thing does.. ..not go inside his small brain. Till then he will not understand! What, I have a small brain? I had thought., ..that I would forgive you for your misbehaviour. But now the water has raised above the level.. ..so now I will have to go to the lawyer! For what reason will you go to the lawyer? - For separation. What does that mean? - Divorce, divorce. You will have to go to the lawyer for your son. But I am the lawyer of my daughter here. Go away. I divorce my daughter from your son right here! Gangu-bai. - You keep quiet. This old man has lost his mind. - What? What did you say? - You called me.. .. an old man who has lost his mind. Al right, I will bring the lawyers notice with me tomorrow. Why are you threatening about notice? If you are a man then take a decision right now! Gangu-bai. - You keep quiet. Go, go, go and bring a paper from.. ..your lawyer with your son's thumb impression on it. Even we will have a paper signed by our daughter! Gangu-bai. - You keep quiet. Sir, if your moustache is real. The you will set foot in this house.. ..only when you will have the divorce.. ..papers with you, understand! Okay, okay now I will come in this.. ..house with the divorce papers! And if I will not come with the divorce papers. Then my name is not Albert Fernandez, understand? Yes. Yes, you can go. What does he think? He doubts my daughter. Albert sir, thank you very much. What thank you, your Gangu-bai.. ..fully shredded me into pieces. She has been doing drama for the past 25 years. That is why she is so good. She acts in the drama. - Yes. - Where? In our neighbourhood. When there is Ram Lila playing there. She does the role of Shrupnaka. But Albert sir, the way you helped us. Thank you very much for that. Thank you. - Shrupnaka. No, father, no. The woman who does not respect you. Is not worthy to be my wife! No, my son, don't think like that. This issue had started with me. And I will have to find a solution for it. And for that you went to that house to be insulted. My respect would be on you and Rajni living together. I will be happy, and also proud. These are your divorce papers, Sign on them. What are you saying, father? On one hand you are saying.. .. that you want us to live together. And on the other hand you are telling.. ..me to sign this divorce papers? How can both things be possible? I don't understand! This is the way the chess is played my son. And anyway your sign on the papers will be dummy. But with this paper I will bring your wife on the right path. Mother-in-law, mother-in-law. I have fever since last night. And also I have lot of pain in the chest. Did the child drink milk? - No. He is crying with hunger. No, I am unable to feed him. I think there is some problem. Oh God, the milk must have clotted. " When the thorn pierced the foot." "Then the hands and feet stopped working." " When the tears filled the eyes." "Then even the heart filled with sadness." " When the pain of the wound." "Spread all over the body." "Then love crossed all the boundaries." " Who can control the heart." " Look, this is the world." "This is the world." "This is the world." " Look, this is the world." I am a mother of four children. Only a mother can understand your pain. And so I crossed the boundary. That is why I have broken the promise.. ..that my husband had given me. God, please forgive me. What have you named the child? Lovingly Munna, and real name is Deen Dayal. You have named him after the person, whose name I cannot utter. Okay, I am leaving. Godavari, you have proved that.. ..the husband is a stranger, but the son is your own! That is why you crossed the line, and went to the other side! Women like you give more importance.. ..to a son than the husband! But, please listen to me first. What are you doing? When the wife dies, then, after the last rituals.. ..the husband has to take a bath! This was that bath! No, don't say like that. For God's sake, don't say like that. To hate you, and go away.. ..I don't have the guts, or the strength! But now, you will not talk to me until my last breath. - Oh no! Sir, sir, oh my God. What is this sir? You are drinking in the garden in the middle of the night. Have you gone mad in your old age? Everyone is searching for you there. Come on, sir. Let's go home. Which house are you talking about, Gangu-bai? In that house, where the son does not belong to you. Even the wife does not belong! There is no respect, and no boundaries! You call that a house, Gangu-bai? Let's go home, sir. I have even lost my job now. There is still one thing that belongs to me. And that is, this alcohol! " All my life I ran in this race of life." " All my life I ran in this race of life." " Now what is the use?" " Now what is the use?" " Now what is the use of this old horse, shoot him." " All my life I ran in this race of life." " Now what is the use?" " Now what is the use?" " Now what is the use of this old horse, shoot him." " Leave me, I say leave me." " Leave me I say." " Whatever I gave to my children, it was my duty." " Whatever I gave to my children was my duty." " Whatever I took from my children." " Became a loan from me." " Even the loan is okay." " Even the loan is okay." " Even the loan is okay, but they even added interest to it." " All my life ran I in this race of life." " Now what is the use?" " Now what is the use?" " Now what is the use of this old horse, shoot him." " Where do the children now respect.. ..the love given to them by the mother?" " Where do the children now respect.. ..the love given to them by the mother?" " Forget about the love, they even disrespect them now." "These selfish people." "These selfish people." "These selfish people did not even leave me worth anything." " All my life I ran in this race of life." " Now what is the use of." " Now what is the use of." " Now what is the use of this old horse, shoot him." Mother-in-law, will you not talk to me? Your father-in-law has made me silent.. ..because of that matter, daughter-in-law. Father-in-law has stopped talking to you. He has not refused to spend his life with you. Unless we solve this problem from the root. This problem will not be solved. This house has become quagmire, mother. We will break this one by one. Only then it will break. I did not understand, daughter-in-law. I will explain everything to you. You just tell me, will you help us? My help, what help? Today that Albert sir is coming. I will shred him into pieces. You just agree to everything I say. What do you mean? - You did not explain the plan to her? I will explain it to her. - Be careful. Look! You are the servant that had insulted me! - Yes! I have brought an answer to that insult. Here are the divorce papers. This Gangu-bai called me arrogant.. ..she called me an old person who has gone mad. She also called me narrow minded! And you kept listening to all this insults quietly! Jamuna-ji, no Kaveri-ji, no Godavari-ji. Even you see it clearly, here are the divorce papers! Next, you are the defendant in this case. No you are the opposition. No whichever side you are, see it clearly. My son has signed on these papers! You can use this as a divorce paper. And after that, you can fill in the amount.. ..that your daughter requires to spend the rest of her life. After that, your daughter will not interfere in my son's life! And my son will have nothing to do with your daughter! Here is the legal proof! Please, keep this with yourself. My dear relative, I am really proud of myself. That what I had said that day on your doorstep. I have done it. Haven't I done it, Gangu-bai? Yes you have shown it and I have seen it. Now tell me what do you want? The divorce papers with my daughter's signature on it? Then wait here, I will just bring the stamp paper. Wait, you don't have to go anywhere. I have brought it along with me. You keep it along with you. Very smart. You have made all the arrangements and come. Rajni, write your name in capital letters on this. Mother, please tell her. Come on, and write. Do we have some respect or not. Quickly, sign on this and give him. No mother, mother please explain her. Dear, it is the question of our respect. Come on do it. Come on. - Mother, mother let us think it over. Take. Albert. - There is no one here, even then you are acting. You are calling me Albert! Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me, forgive me. Ok. Ok, Gangu-bai, tell me what is Rajni doing? She is inside, crying. Rajni, Rajni dear, if you want, we can be friends again. There is a very important function in our house. It is important you attend it. On Saturday, the 18th of this month, my son Peter and.. .. Marie D'Sousa, the daughter of my friend from London.. .. are going to get married in the St. Peter's church. Here is the invitation card. Please attend the marriage dear. Okay, I am leaving. Hey beware, if you will make noise then I will stab you. If you will stab me, then I will die. Tell me truly, who is the richest person in this colony? I want to rob his house. What is your name, thief brother? What will you do with my name? I cannot do anything, but if I knew it then. - Bholu. Bholu brother, I work here as a watchman just for namesake. I can't even catch the thieves. Can't you see my age? Actually I have taken some loan from my son.. ..which I have to repay. But if you will loot here, than I will loose this job. But you tell me, why do you rob people? To feed my family, I have come.. ..here to rob for the first time. You look like a respected man by appearance. Tell me, how old is your son? - 5 years. Then wait for another 25 years. When he will grow up and.. ..cover your wishes with the shroud of loans. Then you will realise that why didn't.. ..you kill your son in the cradle itself? I will give you an advice. You throw your son from the fifth floor of some building. Yes, and become a watchman in some colony. Because it is better to die as a watchman, than a thief. Give this knife to me. And start doing some work. Bye. - Bye, go. Yes I have seen it, you go. I will come myself and talk to the shopkeeper. This way we will be bankrupt. What is all this? - Why? What happened? The bill of the general stores is 300 rupees. What used to be the bill in that house? The total would be around 400 rupees. If for eight people, it was 400 rupees. Then for two people, it should be 100 rupees. This is a bill for 300 rupees. What do you think? I waste money. Look, you need this medicine after food. The price of the medicine is increasing everyday. If you will not have this you will fall ill. After the bath this scented powder. It's only for you. And this is your hair oil. You need two bottles in a month. The how much you apply on your hair. You drop that much on the floor. And this toothpaste, only for you. I brush my teeth with the neem-stick. Even in that house everyone uses neem-stick. Here is your shaving cream. And here is you' re after-shave lotion. I don't use all this. And yes, do you know what is the price of ghee? 65 rupees per kilo. If there is even a little less ghee in the food. Then you get very angry. And then, what are my own and the child's expenses? Baby oil, baby food and sometimes doctor's expenses. And the rest are all your expenses. In that house your expenses would.. ..be around 100 or 1 50 rupees. But no one ever calculated it. If you had known before,.. ..that the expenses of the house would increase so much.. ..then you never would have divided.. ..the household. Isn't it? Daughter-in-law, you had.. ..a bath at this time of the night? This is horrendous, mother-in-law. - Why? Vidya studies in their room, for the whole night? - Yes. Now I understand the whole matter. Shiva, there is a call for you. Hello, Shiva speaking. Shiva, I am Bhabhi speaking. Look Shiva, if you don't want to.. ..talk to me, then don't answer me. But listen properly to what I say. It is very good that you are concentrating on Vidya's studies. But for that, why are you making Basanti suffer? Shiva, you have proven that you are obedient son. And a very good brother. But you still have to prove that you are also a good husband. Do you understand what I mean to say? Mother, next week my engineer.. ..friend is getting married in Allahabad. It is very important for me to go. If you will give permission, than can I take Basanti along? Why? She is your wife, you don't have.. ..to take permission from me to take her along. Basanti, make arrangements for going. If the both of us will go together. Than engineer sir will be happier than us. Mother. - Will you have tea dear? No mother, today is the 18th. Are you fasting? That you will not drink tea on the 18th. No mother, the date today is the 18th. I know that, dear. Yesterday was the 17th and tomorrow will be the 19th. Than surely today will be the 18th. Today is Peter marriage. Peter, who is this Peter? Oh, the one who had sent you divorce papers. Whether he marries again or goes to hell. Why should we worry about him? He had sent the divorce papers not me. You and Gangu-bai forced me to. Oh my God, how smart are you acting now? You yourself argued with your husband and father-in-law! You insulted them. You had said it yourself. That my husband will come to ask for forgiveness. My husband will fall at my feet. His husband turned out to be very smart. I know my husband very well. You have done it and now you bear it. I was innocent but you could have.. ..given me the right advice. Advice, advice is given to people who have brains. Gangu-bai! - At that time your brain had stopped working. But now you have become smart again. Mother I am going right now. I will go and ask for forgiveness.. ..from father-in-law and Peter. If you are going then wear some nice clothes and go. There is a marriage going on there. What are you saying Gangu-bai. I am not going to attend the marriage. I am going to stop it. How will you stop it? The invitation card.. ..for the marriage must have reached to the guests by now. Mother-in-law, it seems like this time.. ..that Rajni express has really left. It is good, it seem like it will stop at the church. No, no seeing here it seems like that.. ..Rajni express has left the parents.. ..house and will only stop at her husband's house. Come, come Rajni dear. I was waiting for you. Father-in-law, that marriage. Marriage, what marriage? Whose marriage? Peter's marriage. - Peter's marriage. Who told you? You had given me this invitation card and invited me. This, I had printed just one card for giving only to you. And I had to pay 65 rupees for this one card alone. And that argument between Gangu and you? And that divorce papers. That was all a drama, dear. And what about your London-friend John DiSouza? - That was a life. And Mary DiSouza? - That was also a lie. Look daughter, for Peter you are Mrs. Fernandes. And for me you are Rajini Fernandes. Than why did you do this drama, father-in-law? I had done this drama to unite you and Peter. Till I am there for you canit separate. Where is Peter, father-in-law? Outside in the car, waiting for you. Peter. Peter I love you. I love you too, Rajni. I love you. My son. This is a Church. And I am father. People worship here. You can do the other things at home. Yes please. - Can we get a double room in your hotel? Yes sir, for how many days do you want it? - For three days. Okay, sign here. The key for 407 please. The room is very nice isn't it? - Yes. Now tell me when is the marriage.. ..so that I can get ready. Now for three days we have lots of time. What do you mean? My dear, we did not have the chance.. ..to be alone in the house. That is why I have brought you here. Okay listen, I will go to the market.. ..and make the arrangements for.. ..our auspicious day and auspicious night. Basanti, look what all I have brought for you. What happened basanti. I started shivering and also got fever. - Fever. You have very high fever. I will get the doctor now. Mr. Shiva, your wife has measles. - What? But there is no need to be worried. She will be fine again in a few days. But you will have to take some precautions. Do you understand what I mean? I understood it very well doctor. I know what precautions to take during measles. Okay, I will leave now. - Just a minute doctor. Give these sweets to your children. And offer these flowers to God. - Thank you. " What a wedding night this is." " What a wedding night this is." " What a husband he is." "One is the meeting of the bodies." " And other is the tune of the heart." "The body and beauty are a not.. ..going to be there with you always." "This is a truth and people are unaware of this truth." "This is not the relation of the body." "This is the love of the heart." " Look, this is the world." "This is the world." "This is the world." " Look, this is the world." I have passed. I have passed. Father. - Bless you son. Mother. - Bless you son. Brother. - When you have touched.. ..the feet of mother and father. Then there is no need of touching my feet. Here take, your gift. Go and enjoy with your friends. Thank you brother, thank you Bhabhi. Mother, I going to give the news.. ..of my passing to my friends. What are you doing? - There is a strange confusion. I have gathered all the new and old containers. But I cannot calculate how much.. ..milk the child has drank this month. What are you saying? Does any mother or father keep.. ..account of how much milk his child has drank? I don't like calculating everything at all. What will I do if you don't like it? You just like to call in the office.. ..and say that you need this you need that. There are that expenses there these expenses! We have to go to the doctors! We have to go to him! The salary gets spent even before coming in hand. Before when we used to live together.. ..I used to give only 800 rupees. But nowadays 1 500 rupees is also not enough. I don't know how will l get rid of this problem. If you knew this before that all this problems would arouse. Then you would never had the house been divided, lsn't it? Mr. Vijay Kumar Sharma. According to my promise I have.. ..made arrangements for your principle.. ..amount along with the interest. Pick up this money and tell me quickly.. ..that when are you vacating this house? Father I have realized my mistake. Please forgive me. Because of my foolishness this household shattered. I promise you the. That I will keep my entire salary in your hands. Let me be a part of this family once again. I beg of you. Shiva, the house should be vacated by this evening. Tell them that there is no need to leave.. ..anything behind that belongs to them. And not to take anything that belongs to us. I give you this responsibility. After they have left, wash the house with phenol. Until then I will sit in the temple and wait. Oh my God, he is smart. That day when you divided this house in two parts. In had cursed you a lot. But today that you have admitted your mistake. And even asked for forgiveness. Even then he did not forgive you like a big-hearted man. Even I will see that how he will not forgive you. Give it to me. Give the child to me. I will see the sir. He is very smart. Sir, just like you have decided. They will vacate the house today itself. They will not take anything belonging to you. But whose possession is this? Is this theirs because he was born in their house? Or is this yours because he was born on your family. All the grandsons of the world hit their grandpa while playing. But what kind of a grandpa are you? You hit your own grandson. Are you very arrogant? The elder son who will perform your last rituals. You threw him outside the house. How will you get salvation! And the grandson who is going to show you the way. You even refuse accept him You wonit get a place even in hell. Your spirit will wander in place.. ..all over the place, all the times. 20 and 25 are the age to take revenge. And 50 and 55 is the age to forgive. Look at your age. It is nice to be an elder. But it is even better to be great. Please forgive me. I have stayed and worked in your.. ..house since my childhood. That is why I had the courage to say all this. Sir, I am leaving this child here and going. If you think that this is a burden. Then leave it here. But if you feel that he is your own. Then bring him along. My dear son, our house has come. The child is feeling sleepy. Say grandfather. Wake my dear son. How much are you sleeping? What are you watching Vijay brother. Go and ask for forgiveness. Father, I have realised my mistake. Please forgive me also. Vijay, I have forgotten that incident like a bad dream. Wait. Where are you going? From where I should have never left. There Uma. Are you going there forever or will you return on this side. I am asking you because if you.. .. are going there to return back here. Then I will go with you happily. But if you are going there forever then listen one thing. You separated from them to save your expenses. But after the separation your expenses increased. If you are going there to save your expenses. Then will you get the same respect there again? Father and mother are your elders. If they will say something then I will feel bad. But don't forget that your elder brother.. ..and his wife also live there. If they will say something harassing. Then I will not tolerate it. What are you saying daughter-in-law? When the enmity is finally ending. You are starting it again. The seed of enmity has already.. ..been sown in this house. Now nothing can be done, Gangu-bai. Nothing can be done. I am telling you, think about it once more. You went through so much trouble to end this enmity. I not only tried to end the enmity in this house Gangu-bai. I also tried to end the hatred in their heats. I always wanted that all of us to live together. And this house should always be filled with happiness. Daughter-in-law, you are so intelligent. Then why are you talking like this. I am intelligent mother-in-law. Then why did you punish me for his mistakes? What mistake did I make? When I came in this house for the first time with the child. You did not even come to do the.. ..veneration to remove the evil eye. Alright, if you could not have come. Then you could have sent Gangu-bai.. ..and completed the rituals. But after seeing the child and me you behaved like. A illness has come in this house. If I would have been intelligent. Then would I have kept quiet? Tell me mother-in-law. Bhabhi. - You called me. Did you take permission from your father to talk to me? That day when I called you in the garage. You did not even ask me that Bhabhi.. ..how are you? How is your child? Even you did not leave any chance to hurt me Shiva. Bhabhi, the elders may have made mistakes. At least come this side for my sake. Mother, I am going to give the news.. ..of my passing to my friends. You were the one who hurt my feelings. If you will become a successful.. ..man after completing your education? Won't I feel happy in that? If you had told me that directly.. ..then how happy I would have felt. Forget it. Go away from here! Go! You all don't think that I am taunting you. Or that I am pointing to your wrong behaviour. But I understood one thing very well. Only a husband is responsible.. ..for the respect and also the insult of a wife! What a fool I am. I had thought that in my own home.. ..I would have the love of a father and mother-in-law. We all would stay together. I will get lots of love. But that was my mistake. I am such a big fool. A joint family is like a branch of flowers. Even if a single flower breaks from it. It cannot be joined back. But thank God, the flower is saved from breaking away. Today Is a very auspicious day. Today, every one is together again. But by staying away, if we meet.. ..only on special occasions and festivals. And ask each other, how are you? How is everyone at home? Then this love will prosper longer. But if by staying together we will fight again. And again these boundaries will be drawn. Then I will not be able to tolerate it. I will die. That is why it is better for us to stay away. Rather than staying together and.. ..drifting apart from each other. Daughter-in-law is this your last decision? Come, father-in-law, please come. You have come for the first time in your daughter-in-laws home. Should I make sweets for you? Will you eat it? Father-in-law, being the eldest daughter-in-law.. ..of this house, I have fulfilled all my duties. But as you had said, it is better that we live separately.. ..but not forever. We will come here every Sunday. Because we cannot live more than.. ..six days without seeing each other. We will sit together and have food. But in the evening we will return to our own home. And this will keep going on until the rest of our lives. Isn't it right? "This is the World." " Look this is the world." "This is the world." "This is the world." " Look this is the world." "This is a lesson that everyone should remember." " in every happiness and sadness." " We should always be together." " We should live together happily." " We should stay a little apart from each other." " Where there is this distance." "That is a happy family." " Look this is the world." "This is the world." "This is the world." " Look this is the world." "This is not the story of happiness." "This is not the tale of sadness." " Life is a game of chess. " " Look this is the world."
