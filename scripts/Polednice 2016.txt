You know your dad, when he was a little boy, he stole our cherries? Well, look, Elika. We want to sell you the house, of course. It's in our interest. I see that your Tom signed the purchase agreement, but... But now... How are you going to pay for it? I have insurance. Once it's settled, I'll pay it all at once. Yes, but the right thing would be to wait until it's all settled. I know, Mr. Mayor, but this is a new beginning for us. Anetka and I thought that it'd be nice to move here where her dad grew up. Well, in the village we've helped each other since forever. And Tom... He even stole our apricots. Here's my stamp of approval. THE NOONDAY WITCH I've registered your address there. - Thanks. You didn't have to do that. - No problem. Anything for Tom. Though, why did he pick this place for you? For that money you could've bought a house in the village. Not far from us, by the cemetery. - We don't want to live in a cemetery. - Right. Who would want to live in a cemetery, right? - This is where I'll go to school? - You want to go to school? - You still have a month's vacation. - No, not now! In September. Then yes. - Where dad went to school? - Yup. - When is dad coming to be with us? - Soon, don't worry. I don't like how he's always away. Dude! - You're driving like you stole us! - Sure I'd steal you, you treasure. We had so much fun with Tom! Though he was always kinda weird. I've hooked up the lines for you. Gas and electricity should be on. - Thanks. You didn't have to do that. - No problem. Anything for Tom. But I gotta tell you, that house isn't a mansion. If you need anything done, now that you're alone... If you need help with anything, just tell me. Where are you going, Anetka? Are you thirsty? You thirsty? - You still have water? - Yup. We've had none since last week. I may come by to take a shower, eh? I'll do it, after I gulp it down. Where do you want it? In the back. Anetka? Have you seen her? Anetka, I've been looking for you everywhere. I'm sorry. - What are you doing? - Cleaning up. - Why here? - It's for dad. When he comes, it'll make him happy. There was a letter for you. I hid it so the girl wouldn't find it. Could you give me a hand? Sure. From the authorities I guess. Thank you, Mr. Polek. It's Zdenk. Since forever. We ain't strangers. Once we settle in, Anetka and I would like to give a party. I hope you and your wife will come. Sure. My wife is busy, but I can stop by anytime. For coffee or to fix something. Thank you. They're waiting for you. - So see you around. - Goodbye. What is it? - A letter. - From who? How come you're not sleeping? Well? First night in a new house. - How do you like it here? - I do. And you? I like it. Bang, bang, sounded in the room, and little Johnny hid behind the hearth. Bang, bang, sounded again, this time even louder. Little Johnny drew aside a curtain and looked behind the door... - Mom? - Yes? - Are we going to have a party? - We will. As soon as we settle in a bit. - Will dad be here for the party? - I don't know. - When is he coming? - Soon. Will you argue again? You can't argue at a party. Parties are fun. We'll never argue again. Want to finish the story? I know what happens. Sun takes him away but Moon saves him. Want to sleep in my bed? Not even tonight? The first night? You're a brave girl. My curious kitty. You're looking at the pictures without me? I was just looking for something. G'night. I'm here only because it's the first night and dad isn't here. - So you won't be here alone. - Okay. Mom, come outside. Watch Movies & Series imon, those are new shoes. Wow, stop bringing more stuff, there's no room. But it's yummy, no doubt. Thanks. Anetka and I did our best, I'm happy you like it. I'm happy you welcomed Anetka and me like this. We've been here for a couple weeks now, this is a new beginning for us. We appreciate everything you do for us. Thank you. That was nice speech! Beautiful. Don't see that very often. Da here could learn from you. The cooking and the speaking. Da! Elika, those were really nice words. We live near the church. You can't miss it, girl. I mean... ma'am. Let's cut the formalities. I mean we're not neighbors, there ain't any here. What do you say? - I'd love to. Elika. - Da. So, come by anytime. Bring Anetka too, okay? And now I want to know how you manage all this alone. Polkov, being nosy again? Snooping around, eh? Careful, Elika. When she grips on something, she doesn't let go. Watch it! Careful, Mayor, so your wife doesn't see it. - You have a wife? - Yes. - Why didn't she come with you? - She did. And where is she? Don't lie! What are you doing? Where are you manners? She tripped me. You stay here and don't move! I'll deal with it at home. - He said dad won't come back. - He will, don't worry. Aneka! This is Elika, I've told you about her. Tom' wife, remember? Tom, who stole our cherries. Then he grew up and moved to the city, where he met Elika and they have this beautiful little princess. Come say hello. You can do it. I'm Elika. I am happy you came, Mrs. Mrzov. Have you had anything to eat? Aneka, want something to eat? Don't you worry, he'll be back. Well? How is the house? Okay? Yes, but I need some help. - Tell me. - Water's not running. And it won't. There's a drought. It hasn't been this bad... I mean it was. Once. A tank truck comes to the square every Tuesday and Thursday. Okay. Then there's this. Don't mean to cut in. Just wanted to ask if you have the shades. Excuse me? Did you make your shades? If not, I could help you with it. - He means glasses... - I can speak for myself. I mean eclipse viewers... - Let's go home... - Wait! - An eclipse is coming... - Let's go! Now when it's starting to be fun, I should go home? Let's go, you're drunk. I'm sorry, Elika. - You're on first name terms? Zdenk. - We are too, Zdenk. - We've been acquainted. - Let's go. -Wait! I'd cut them out of cardboard for you now that you have no husband. - Come on, let's go. - I'm coming. I can stop by any time. You can count on me. - Tell her that she can count on me. - Yes, you can count on him. - Let's go, you're plastered... - Don't let that upset you. You're drunk as a skunk, go home... Why are you taking the chair? They think that Tom...? But that means you won't get any insurance benefits. What then? Don't know. - No, I can't! - Just take it. It's terrible what's happening to people. No matter what happened, it's not your fault. The party cost money, so take it as a donation from the village. When everything is settled, I'll pay you back, everything. - I know. - Thank you. Well... it's time to go. - Have you seen Aneka? - No. That's normal, she's probably home by now. - Good night, Elika. - Good night. We're glad to have you here. Bang, bang, sounded again, this time even louder. Little Johnny drew aside a curtain and looked behind the door. - And there, to his surprise, stood... - Mom? -Yes? - Why didn't dad come? - He's too busy. - And when is he coming? - Don't know. - How come? - I don't know! Why did that boy say that he won't come back? I don't know that either. And you shouldn't beat up local boys. - Nobody will like you then. - He shouldn't tell lies. - So listen. - You don't need to finish it. I know what happens. Sun takes him, but Moon saves him. And you are my curious kitty and don't want to sleep in my bed. - So good night. - G'night. Jeez, what are you doing here? Don't be scared. I waited for you and fell asleep. - Your husband was looking for you. - I'll find myself. Should I go get him? - I really need to talk to you. - About what? - She'll come back. - What? - She'll come back and take. - Who? That solitude and heat, that's her. She comes and takes. - Who comes and takes? - She takes a child, won't return it. Please leave. - No, listen to me. - Leave me alone! "Give that child here," she'll say and then you'll be like me. Forever. Enough! Don't worry, little girl. - You'll find each other. - Out! Go! Don't worry. Nobody will come, nobody will take you away from me. I wouldn't give you to anyone in the whole world. You're my everything, Kitty. Together we can do it. You and I. And dad. Mom, I don't want to stay here. Why can't I go with you? Because you just can't, dear. I'll be back in the evening, and we'll make dinner together, okay? - Mom, I want to go with you. - You can't, Aneta! You hear me? It's just for a few hours. I'll be back soon. Wait here. Be a good girl and don't go anywhere. Not to the fence, not behind it, not in the field. Especially not the field, you hear me? I have to go. Mr. Polek will be here soon. Your mom's gone? I see. Maybe you can draw something. And I'll take a nap. Maybe. Hey, come here! Come, I'll show you something. You'll see I didn't lie. - I can't. - It's close, just across the field. Come on. - What is it? - Shhh! Run! Aneta, eat. You don't want it? You like grits, don't you? Aneta, eat, damn it! - I don't want it. - So you'll go to bed hungry. - So what? I don't care. - Don't talk like that! - I want to be with dad. - Go! Go to bed. Anetka, come finish it. Aneta! I thought you were gone. - What are you doing here? - I wanted to talk to you. About what? Does your husband know you're here? - No. He doesn't believe. - Believe what? That she's here. That she comes back again and again. She's close, Elika. I was alone then. And the heat, Elika. - I have to be with Anetka. - Cry. Cry together. She comes, takes and won't give back. Goodbye. There's still time, Elika. Aneta? Aneta, what is it? Nothing! Aneta, open up! - Come out, now! - I'm not coming out. - Why not? - I'm scared here without dad. Come out! Aneta! Ouch! - Aneta, are you going to bed now? - Yup. Want to hear a bedtime story? Yup. Once upon a time in a place far, far away, was a kingdom where, in the Eastern Land's vast fields, lived little Johnny. He didn't have a mommy or daddy... One day, when the sun beat down even more than usual, little Johnny decided to go further than he often did, to a place he had never been before. Anetka? Anetka, I want to tell you something. Good evening, Elika. Good evening. Is your wife home? She's sleeping. Could you please tell her that we don't want her to come visit us? Could you please tell her that? Elika... Come in. Please. It was a year, maybe two, before it happened. I'd taken a job at the regional office and almost never saw them. She came back to me after seven years. They said she wasn't sane. Supposedly it happens, to hurt like that. But she talked about some being, who takes and doesn't give back... A coping mechanism. She has had the delusion that the person who strangled our Honza was not her, but some kind of creature. She's unable to bear the responsibility for what she did. You know we hadn't talked for ages. She returned to me years later. Yet I couldn't even look at her. But not because of what she did to Honza. Out of guilt. She was alone in every way. But it's too late now. Anetka is really scared after all this. She won't leave her room. This is not what I wanted. We came here to be close to Tom, to start all over, but not this. But I can't just tie her to the bed. Though... sometimes I would love to... Between you and me, Elika, sometimes I wish God had taken her to His loving home and freed her from her pain. And Anetka still doesn't know... Damn it! Finally you came! You'd always drop her here when I was at work, but today I have time for the princess. No, not for me. I have to run. I'll be back as soon as I can. I'm sorry, Mrs. Polkov. I mean Da. I wanted to ask if your husband could stop by. The drain's plugged, blind's broken, if you could send him over. I'll send him there. He chases after you anyway. - That mangy old fool... - This is the last time. And Anetka and I will have some fun, right? Rise and shine! Lunch is ready. Eat. Chicken soup warms your soul. - Hi. - Hello. What would you like to do in the afternoon, Princess? See, I didn't lie. Don't you worry, little girl. Your mom's here, Princess. To the table, the meat will be ready soon. What'll you have, Elika? - We should go now. - Oh no, no way! You think that you can just run away each time? What about the meat? It's bad, eh? Let me get you something for it, it's your nerves. I have these pills, I take them all the time. - This is a fucked-up world. - It's done, ladies! Done? It's still white! Keep grilling! Can't you see we're talking? I heard two people died over the hill. An old man and a baby. One got sunstroke, the other heatstroke. It's brutal, this heat. I finished my beer. Anybody want some? The old fool. He's losing it too. As long as we have food and drinks, no need to worry, right? What is it, Princess, you don't like it? Eat. Aneta! When is dad coming back? What? When is dad coming back? Soon. Eat. Eat. "Denied." "No sign of foul play." "Our deepest condolences, State Insurance." It's from dad? - No. - Who then? - It's just... the authorities. - What do they want? - What is it? - Nothing. - What's wrong, Aneta? - Nothing. - Where is dad? - Gone. - And when is he coming back? - I don't know. - When is he coming back? - Don't know. I don't know when! Hello. Da sends some flowers or whatnot. And the drain needs fixing, Da said so. And something's wrong with the blind. - Where is the girl? - There. So I'll get to work. It's fixed, that darn thing. Aneta! Don't bother. You won't catch her. The kids... You look tired. Hope you don't get sick. Wouldn't be a surprise, in this heat. Come sit down. Come on. A drink's the best cure for this. Always ready. Since forever. Want some? What are we drinking to? Good, eh? Then Da and I got married. But it's been ages now. Because men are... I don't know about Tom, he was always a bit different. You must know, Elika. He was always kinda weird. Men are different in that way. It's an urge. They can't help it, it's in their nature. It might not seem fair, but life is unfair. Since forever. Where have you been? - Elika... - Quiet! Why do you keep coming here? We came here to find peace, you hear me? To live in peace! And you keep bothering us. You keep bending her ear. You're scaring us. We're terrified of you. Leave us alone! - Elika... - I don't want to listen to you. I'm scared of you. And she's scared of me. Locks herself in her room. - I'm protecting her, Elika... - You didn't protect your own child. You know what happened to her? Her dad killed himself. You told her? The pipes must be taken apart... So I could come... I'll come back. You can count on me. Zdenk, what's up, dude? Mr. Mayor, we worried that you wouldn't drink with us. No, not today. Have you seen Aneka? No. But that's normal, right? It's late. Zdenk, have you seen her? Have a drink with us. She'll be found. I'll go look in the fields. Dude, what's up? Where are you going, man? Jeez! I came to finish the work. You're out of your mind. Go away! You should be happy I'll do it for you. - It's midnight, leave! - I can't come tomorrow. Done! - It's done? - Sure is. So thank you. No problem. But not everything is for free, you see? I think you should leave. Mrzov is running loose. I'll protect you. Please go away. Aneka? Speak only good of the dead. I haven't seen you for some time, Cutie. - She was sick. - Poor girl. Such a beautiful summer, and you're sick? Is she okay now? So stop by sometime, now that she's better. That natural event is coming up. Bring your shades with you and meet in our garden. We'll grill something. What a tragedy. Crazy woman. She kept running around in the fields, heat or not. How many times have I told her she'd fry, and here it is. But speak only good of the dead. Into your hands, O, Lord, we humbly entrust this good woman, gone to her rest, may she share in the joy of your resurrection. May her sins and failings committed in moments of weakness be forgiven by your merciful love. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen. Want to watch the eclipse with me? I made the shades for us, look. So come to our house, okay? I'm sorry. I apologize. When I drink too much then I, since forever... Even with Da. I didn't mean to touch you. Nothing happened, right? I know... Could you please not tell anyone about it? Please. Don't tell anyone. Why didn't you change, Anetka? You'll fry in this. Want to go plant flowers with me? Or whatever it is. I don't even know. We have a flower bed. Come on. Anetka? You hear me? Damn it, come here, Aneta! Can you come here?! I think they're flowers. Some might be vegetables. We need the rain to come, or it will all wither. The Poleks have beautiful flowers, eh? Isn't it nice when we do things together? Just the two of us. Together. Aneta, what are you doing?! Go to your room! Now! Go! No way! Go to your room! I told you to go to your room! No! I don't want to go! She takes and won't give back... Mom? She'll be back... Moon embarrassed little Johnny, lifted him up into the sky and took him back to the land far far way, all the way to his house. And they all lived happily ever after. Good night, Anetka. Now I'll wash you, Anetka. And then we'll make breakfast. We'll make a strudel. You like strudel, don't you? And everything will be fine. It's over now. Give me your hands. Together we can do it. You and I. - Elika... - What do you want? Open the door, Elika. I'm sorry, I can't. Elika, for God's sake, what's in the windows? Go away. Elika... I don't know what's going on, but Aneka... this is how it started. And you know how it ended. Elika... Goodbye. Fine. Listen to me. If you want to talk to someone, you know where to find me. I'm worried about you. Give that child here. Give that child here... - Give that child here. - No! - Mom, let go of me. - No, I won't let you go. No! No! Let go! No! No! - Anetka! - Mom, you're scaring me. Anetka. I'm sorry. Forgive me. I'm sorry, Anetka. Please forgive me. Anetka, forgive me.
