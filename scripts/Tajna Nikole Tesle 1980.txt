Long nobody has visited me. Where you will publish it? I'm a freelance reporter . You are used to dispose of big money. Worked 're J. P. Morgan, is not it? We had a great chance. - What chance? It was a road that is mankind chose those you could choose. What would led in a completely different direction. Is it true that you once received unknown signals from outer space? - That's what I said all I had to say. - When? At a press conference in Waldorf Astoria, 1890th Just one more question. You collaborated with Edison and George Westinghouse. Is true you Westinghouse forgive the debt of 10 million dollars? - Mladic, the two are very different. George and I now often together... Mr. Tesla, he's dead. He died many years ago. You'll say that Mark Twain dead? -for 30 years. This is 1943. - Well, you see... I was with him yesterday discussed. But I really do wanted to talk to Morgan. And now, young man, please to leave me. - Thank you, Mr. Tesla. Morgan... Everyone else always happy to talk to me. But Morgan... After so many years has not replied yet. All these terrible things could have been avoided. I told him. I showed him what would be world. He said that we would know when it is ready. I'm still waiting. LOS ANGELES IN THE FOG Welcome to America. Next These are all your children? You're a parent? Nikola Tesla! From Paris. Born in Smiljani, Croatia-Austria. How many have children. - I have no family, I am. Welcome in America, Mr. Tesla. It's a real spell, Tom. Every time you hear that your machine that records voice it seems to me all udesnijim. Thank you, Catherine. I came up with the name. Phonograph. What do you think? - How Whatever you call it is still one of your wonders. Maybe greatest. - Bob, you are my old friends. I you can confide. I feel that this project with Falls could be also important as anything I've done. - You are the only a man who would do it. In this we are sure. - Excuse me. What is it? - That guy from France. He was here and yesterday, but you had a job. - Again, I'm busy. Some came Next week early. - Passable man. Do it make for us. - Each inventor of Europe wants come to America. - There is a letter for you from your Director Paris. - OK. Let entered. Mr. Tesla, Mr. Edison will see you now. But, boy? It is this letter? - Yes. - This letter serves to show Mr. Nikola Tesla. Well, you are presented. Mr. Tesla, welcome to America. Thank you, Miss... Mrs. Robert Johnson, and this is my husband. Perhaps you'd rather stay alone. No, stay. I'll talk about something that would could be of use to the whole wide Mankind. - Do you have this said somewhere else, I would not you believe. But here are already was born so many wonders. Here we used the impossible becomes reality. Watch what you say. This man chief editor of the newspaper Century Magazine. I think gentleman never heard of newspapers where he came from. From France have? That's where I work but I was born in Lika. Maybe Lika is a place where Raddai miraculous things. What you say, Tom? - Never heard of it. It is on the border between Austria and Turkey. Character is province, the place is Smiljan. - Do you know what it says? "Dear, Mr. Edison. Know Only two big men. You are one of them, Nikola Tesla and others. Sidima with little clouds. Do you have something to show me? Here, Mr. Edison. As you can see, this is rotating magnetic field. What are served? - Here intersects tappers in point A and induces current flowing to contact Rings B-expected to going to start the engine? Yes, and no energy loss when is transmitted to a great distance. Something you forgot. Commutator. It's not even necessary. It is alternating current. Alternating? - Yes. If you use DC, you need a hundred exchanges to highlight New York, and then peripherals remains in the dark. And with my system, one can exchange illuminate a whole city, more and more, a whole country. We throw in wind energy which gave us the nature. Today's electricity imperfect and unnatural. You'll agree with me, we We are at odds with nature. Alternating current energy rattled up nesluenih scale. We will build a new switchboard, and old crash. This giant step forward Amend the whole world. Demolish all my switchboard Because of this your motoria? But Tom... - Do you know how I call? "King of electricity." I've already changed the world and all I achieved based on direct current. You go awry, it is advance sentenced to fail. Where are you going? I'm sorry I took your time. I thought you work for me. Have an original spirit, perhaps brilliant. You have made one mistake. So what? I need every smart a man who can find it. Come morning, exactly at seven. Thank you. I sincerely appreciate it. Goodbye. - Yet we are to see. - I hope. - I. Tom, you really are a great ovijek? Yes? I'm glad that you were so generous. He looks as an interesting young man and crossed the whole world to come to America and worked with you. I know a smart man. A little confused, but still there is something. Already we'll fix it. Am I seeing right? Mr. Tesla! - Hello, Mrs. And Mr. Johnson. Is this a scientific iztraivanje or doing what What we seem to do? - I dig a trench, Mr. Johnson. Obviously! - Not more Edison? And it's obvious. What happened? - We had some disagreements. I'm going to finish it now. - Thank you you, but this is better than I left. - Lf it is true, Bob will you find something in the newspapers. Is it, Bob? - Yes. Give him his card. And please, come out of this ditch. - We are working up to five hours. Then you can at seven. We will wait you with us. The address is on card. Pledge? - I promise. Did you Catherine explained I thought. You're a very kind. I am grateful to you. - You say you do not want to work? Unfortunately. - You prefer to dig vibrant than being on the editorial board Century Magazine? - Everyone it would be an honor, Mr. Johnson. Bob. - Bob. To me it would be only temporary and would not It is unfair to you. Do not go yet, Nicky. Tell Bob you me said. Oh induction motor? About himself and his family. And the place where you were born. Character, right? - Yes. Like child spoke five languages. His mom was also invented everything but not written. And his father was a priest the Orthodox Church. They are allowed to marry. You are not marrying, Nicky? When I got married, it would be with someone like you. But it is impossible. Good night, and thank you. Escort Mr. Tesla. It must be very poor. But he bought me flowers. He works there in the trenches. - Let's do it. It is Tesla. - I Hiram Brown, president of Wester Union Telegraph Company. Nice to meet you, Mr. Brown. I financed the performance of your engine. - Are you ready finance other Works on izmjeninoj streaming? I have not thought about it. We could start with the engine. I'll just build it in their Workshops. - What would I built for you? - I'll take it build, and you'll pay. You're obdurate, Tesla. Isa's what I heard. How many you need? - 30 Thousand dollars and my workshop. Then came out of the trench to I give you a check. - Hold, Renato. Gramm machine loses much energy. Certainly in nature There is a simpler principle that comes to energy. Mr. Tesla, please. The whole nature in front of you. Niko you nothing to defend. Discover it'll all be happy. I hear all the sounds fivefold. - Take it easy. It is your hypersensitivity. It'll. Watch the sun shine last and huts in the heat of his cup. Already sinking sun, dies day al'ono second new life creates. - When quoting Faust, I know you better. I see it. Ladies and gentlemen, to make sure in it, now I'm going izkljuiti DC and highlight hall of their system. Fight! Well, ladies and gentlemen, It is alternating current. See how the light gives this small generator. Imagine to be that here huge generator. We could it highlight a whole State of New York, and more. We run all the factories, public transport vehicles, all industries. When you do so follow even greater discoveries. One thing will lead to the discovery another, and we will change face of this earth. G-Tesla thus provide a guarantee that your claims accurate? If we invest money, we have to have the assurance that this is so. Gentlemen, I have no guarantee in addition to its discovery. You have to believe and Give in to the instinct and intuition. Returns Back itosmjernu electricity. Mr. Edison, what do you think about Mr. Tesla? - All the best. He is a very capable engineer. - What, practical usability its generators. - I'm sorry, but no. For me fantasy is no concept, especially scientific. So much, gentlemen. - Mr. Edison! Another question! For today, a lot! Next time. Yes it would be worth something already Edison grabbed. Bet- I the wrong horse. Mr. Tesla, Mr. Edison says Your current does not employed in practice application. What do you say? Mr. Edison is a practical man. I'm sorry you feel that way. - It was my pleasure. I wish you luck. Thank you, the demonstration, Mr. Tesla. It was interesting, even if not putting into practice. Thank you. Mr. Tesla, can you... - I have nothing more to say. Enough for today. Thank you, gentlemen. Mr. Tesla, to introduce myself. I'm George Westinghouse, President electric Society of Pittsburgh I'm glad. - It would be I honor that evening with me. That would be me joy, Mr. Westinghouse. - George. Call Me Claus. - Well, Nikola. Excellent. So, I'm ready redeem all of your patents fee of one million dollars. And you shall themselves decide on the use of his invention. You're soul ventures, and I bag. Untied bags. What do you say? Please for some napkins. Your napkins. Thank you. I hope you happy evening, Mr. Tesla. I think you're jumping the gun, Mr. Westinghose. Maybe. In science there is no progress without risk. People and Life at stake... So what is my money? I honestly believe that? - Otherwise I would not be here. And what if other than the million ask for another dollar for each horse power? - I would agreed. Entering into a contract. You agree too. Do you know that I talk about a myriad of horsepower? And Edison would not accept it without a fight. While he was against us, how you will introduce another system? - I can, if I have your patents. The truth is on your side. Tell me honestly. Would you help me because the progress of science or profit? Listen, I pronalaza. But no money can not realize their inventions. And what if calculated on a small profit? Glad to be angry. I'm beginning to believe you. Piece of cheese and an apple, and a good the wash vruoj water. Creamy caramel, fruit can... Coffee certainly. Tesla lived. In your health. - Seems to drink my wine. Right. Sorry. Bewildering me, Tesla. Can be considered we entered into an agreement? - I I was kidding. What do you mean? Horsepower not naplaujem. But I'm not kidding. Profit 'll dollar per horse power. You need to be rich to were free and independent. Tesla, what are you? - Peaches. Take them. I can not bear Jih. - Waiter! Fred! Peaches! Take them. Nothing sweet. Nothing. Gentlemen, break. Who is it for? George, why is Adams so far suggested a break? Billy, do not be naive. No water Adams session than the one emphasizes the fact that it does not. - Yes, we all know it. You hear me? - I hear Adams. - The first part is over. Edison spoke? - No. - A Westinghouse? - Not yet. Call Edison to speak, Westinghouse and then Bring a suggestion or two. Is that clear? - Yes. Suggestion or two. Gentlemen, Thomas Alva Edison here in an advisory capacity. It is useful to hear what he has say. Thank you, President. Gentlemen, what you say. Whether We water pipes leading to plants or plant built near Niagara We can talk about it. But system is one: DC current is accepted. - President! - Mr. Westinghouse. Gentlemen, DC is not the only one. There is also alternating current. The system guarantees transfer to large distance. Simple and a convenient and I Tesla perfected the system with 40 patents. I have this report... Gentlemen, this system is just a fantasy... and it is dangerous. Mr. Edison, on how we could talk. - Happy! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Me talk about the important things. International tender would be the best solution. Mr. Edison, You suggest a man who would led ocjenjivaku Commission. Thank you, President. There is only one man in the world. He's a real physicist, mathematician and a great inventor. Lord Kelvin from Great Britain. Will showcase be another one of your triumph? My power will illuminate the entire exhibition. - Will you have your Principles used to Niagara Falls? I do not know who else. The whole of Europe, the whole world using my system. And what's with alternating power? It does not come into consideration. Alternating current hazardous to human life. Switch on the generator. You have just seen alternating electricity. It was cruel to kill this dog, but we've done that tomorrow someone would die on the same way. Are needed us the means to progress, not to killing. I will ask the Congress to ban the use of alternating current. Thank you! Edison, Nick! Damn Edison! - What happened? President of the Commission is Lord Kelvin. He Edison ovek. Listen to this: "The alternating current used in Sing Sing. Convicted person is not dead painless. Electricity had to activated several times because constructors are wrong calculate the power voltage. "- Disgusting! I'll take care of them, Mr. Tesla. - Let them Czito. Not guilty. Invite and bring together all the people that you know and bring them here. Say you will Tesla current torment their guests. All will come, you'll see! Mr. Enrico Caruso, Mr. Nikola Tesla. Bravo, Tesla, mio?? Caro. Mr. Pederewski, Mr. Nikola Tesla. Nice to meet you. Mr. Samuel Clemens, Alians Mark Twain... Mr. Nikola Tesla. It's my pleasure. - And what I found pleasure in your books, I owe You. You are my only borrower, I remained faithful. Can I help you, Mr. Clemens? - Looking for my critics to help them recommend for an electric chair. Please sit down. Thank you. George. - Catherine, Bob. - Nicky, let me ask you. What will you do tonight? - Catherine, I am now an executioner. In it I have never believed it. Mr. Jack Wilson, Mr. Nikola Tesla. What is it, George? Ladies and Gentlemen, Here you have two electrodes. When you switch on the electricity created will be the voltage of a million volts. It is alternating current. If take also the electrode arms, what would happen? If my electricity kills, then I deserved to be its victim. Nicki, do not, please! His pay any with "Commodore". Mr. Morgan is waiting for you. Arrived, Commodore. - Bring him. Your friend. Mr. Tesla. They tell me that they do not operate. Why? For health- reasons, Commodore. - Edison tells me that washing your hands 20 times a day and every time you are looking for pure towel. You know each other? Yes, we know we are. - I hear you do not drink coffee or tea. What can it offer? Maybe some whiskey? So you like you're a man. Tom, give him a whiskey. Some people assure me that you are crazy. Others think that you crook. Both can be true but you can still to be a genius. Sit down, Mr. Tesla. I'd like to know what you Launches. Do you know what Edison say about genius? - His by famous sayings. Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration. And you do not sweat enough. Do not scientific conclusions arriving intellectual work, rather than using some... What did you say? Ask Tesla. He sees some mental images. Yes, it's a word! And in details. Is it like that with your engine without Brush and without a commutator? It says that the whole thing Tesla came as a vision. More like a flash of lightning. And the lightning you appeared as you are in Hungary, on the street, recited a poem. Yes, Geothea. What? He's Nemaki writer. I'll send you results. - Thank you very much. Motor is turning... - Take the whiskey, Mr. Tesla. The engine is spun in a vortex, the rotational magnetic field that is created interaction of the two alternating currents. Alternating-current! Patented engine six years later and every detail was the same as in the mental picture. Adams we collected a whole story. What are you reading? It's a file on Mr. Tesla. I've nothing to enter the blindly. Tom, you know that. It says that while she worked for You gave him a problem that resolved. - So what? Its people constantly make trouble. This was something important or something that you did not know. Who said that? Where you this story? - The people in your workshop. Easily I to solve, but I was busy with other problems. - We heard you were offered Tesla fifty thousand dollars if resolved, and when he did, he said you tell him that you do not understand American sense of humor. That's no reason misunderstandings. I am not interested in money. I'm interested. You have stopped working for Edison and it was suggested that work for me. Sit down, Tom, I'm not done. - Hm! Yes, Tom? Honestly Commodore, beginning wonder what I'm doing here. I do not think it would be honestly you're not here. There is certainly a steel mills in Pittsburgh! They are waiting for electricity and I can wait forever. - I do not either! I submitted plans for five months. - Tesla has differently ideas. - Anything else! This is one the term for it. - Do you know what made in ikagu? Everything here. - Yes. Until then, there was no large polyphase generators. I'd wonder of Mr. Tesla. I took 24 DC generators of 500 horsepower power and connect them in pairs with their circuits 90 degrees above the stage. - Translate it. I got the equivalent of twelve two-phase generator, each of thousand horsepower. - It was the first World Exhibition illuminated power. That's funny. - Until now thought I thought I invented electrically light. Of course. And now it is suddenly discovered Tesla. And who is your authorized to give the izvjietaj things that you have no idea. I have collected information and I do not pretend that I am educated. Educated? As Tesla. He is knowledgeable, and I did not. Come on, Tom, no one said that. - I do not need it, everyone knows that. You're self-taught, and I've raised. We know that. Well, Tesla landed in this country without money. - I was not even close universities. I studied and worked. First, I learned to respect to science, logical inference, evidence, trial and error. But Our educated man affects! Do not even think he predosjea! That is why all involved with this his A. C. Electricity. - Alternating current? Is it true, Tom? - None of this is true! Mr. Edison's system from the beginning is based on the DC. Tesla? - Despite all the evidence He is convinced that the Alternating current can not function. Visionary-where in the head The lightning flash considers Edison is an illusion of things. Calm down, Tom. Talk of Frankfurt, on Nemakoj. Or do not you know? Adams Excuse it was in Frankfurt. Some Doliva in... - Let names, tell me what they did. Transferred the power of distance 160 km. - Tesla system. This happened in Europe Tesla and we have under his nose. Connect to the General Electric, I'll finance. Immediately we build headquarters in Niagara Falls. - On what system? Damn it, Tom! Why not to do try out? It's useless complications, and with it, and dangerous! I would forbid! I hope you do not leave. We did not finish a game of cards! Do not tap with the door. It always made. My friend is determined man, but the greatest pronalaza in history. If you one can prove him wrong, will not be happy. But I tell you that the two of us in the business. Amazing things happen, Nick. Edison had to merge with General Electrics, but we will not swallow. We're going to them. Because we have patents and design Niagara can not begin without us. - Do you know that it is possible achieve hundreds of thousands and million current pulses Seconds? Do you understand that Fantastic opportunities for us to provides for the use of energy? - Nick, did you hear what I said the General Electrics, for Edison to Niagara? I know you said Morgan. I do not listen to him, Nick. He with people playing and breaks them As a child toys. Let him go! Million electric pulses per second. All right, Nick. Dream all you want. But the effort that you come on time opening hidroelektrarne. Let it stop. George, what would I be stop? I do not know. Still, for a man who so sure of himself, You do not look happy. - How would could it be? - What are you, Nick? Already a few days plague me some pictures that I see. Please urgently need to see Mr. Tesla. Immediately call him. I should not bother him. If you Now I wake up, it will be the your responsibility. - Well, let sleeping while you can. I'll tell him later. What is any? This hotel his home. His heart would burst. His Laboratory worse. All drawings, all inventions, all in flames. Ladies and gentlemen, America is today launched the first power station on alternating electricity. Thanks to everyone who created this work. But do not forget that it was the work Nikola Tesla, without whom this would not exist. Celebrating that I waited. Way to go, Nick! Pay them. Audience and waiting. Now it's all over, this Switchboard is not very important. It's just an application power that already have long know. I am ashamed that they do not made before, and now only comes the real work. We must now come to what is close. To find out what going down, we need to transfer pictures, news, energy, and why not matter. We've got rid of the thought restrictions imposed by space and time, but keep the main characteristics now and through the ages... Sorry, I... Tesla! What I will say Commodor? Yeah I went to Europe. In Europe? Who's in Europe? My mother and sister. George, what happens? Thank you, Catherine. But... Please, this way. Why do not we go? -On Me no leaks. - I already said. No one is allowed inside. - Nonsense. - So says Mr. Tesla. I'm desperate. I must see him. It's my destiny. Why did you invite me? - Due Nicholas. He is in serious condition. Ever since his mother died, my the fear that has descended from the mind. Czito, I know how much you love Mr. Tesla. And we love it. That you need to know... a right He did not need our help? I admit that I am very concerned, Mrs Johson. Attracting and rejecting, Catherine. Miraculous occurrences. Stimulating and exciting. Electricity and magnetism, George. Unique force in nature. - How are you, Nick? Nick, please. Listen to me. I'm at the end of times. I have no other way out but I ask you for help. Nick, the crisis. Pillman is Chicago fired 4000 workers. Yesterday the feds shooting at people on the street. I have no credit. All retreating. Charged me for the debt of $ 10 million to to you. Dollar per horse power. General Eletrics behind everything. Morgan wants to swallow me and Edison. But do not give up. My company is my life. So I thought if I could share loss... This is contract, George? - Yes. It can not afford. It's your money. I owe it to you. You do not owe me nothing. You believed in me when others not, offered me his hand. Thank you, Catherine. Thank you, my friend. That was generous, perhaps too much. Of course it His desire to help, but how You can tear up the $ 10 million? I have no family, Catherine. I just need to do. It would only bother me money. Turn to the right. Now, on the left. Now until the end, and for us. And where are the wires, Mr. Tesla? I thought I understand. Unfortunately not. What can I say Commodor? What you saw. And the wire, tell them no. Tesla, this your boat. Adams told me all apologized. Can you also and with a greater boat at greater distances? Can you take energy from Falls and transferred to my steel mills in Pittsburgh without any wires? - Capabilities of are unlimited. - Communication over long distances? Anywhere. And to Europe, without cables. - I want to hear Tesla. Ships at sea, Tesla? - Each signal. The human voice, images. All of these electrical impulses. And where you want it to? In Colorado Springs. Rich the natural electricity. Do so that i can send message from city to city and across the ocean. It give me so you go to Colorado Springs. The sooner you begin, the better. It was Morgan. He agreed. - This is really a milestone. You can not imagine what this means. - I know. I'm happy. Images and sounds are going through the air without wires. Do I swallow? Already did. Why would otherwise invest your money? Tesla give money roulette. It amuses me, here and there curiosity. Is he a madman or fraud. Promising miracles. We'll see you can achieve them. If the storm struck by lightning country creates concentric waves that circle the globe and Come back. This is proof that the Crust good conductor. To produce large amount of energy and launched In any Taek Earth peel energy would be moved in concentric waves. It is said that you are in Colorado Springs contact with Mars. Is that true? - It is possible launch waves that travel around the country and waves that go into space. How do you talk to them? That's not intended them. But I caught the electric waves unknown origin that repeated at regular intervals. Maybe signals from space. - Have you told them? Ask Martians. - So, you are sending signals? The signal may not receive about one million years. So you think you would one day be possible to achieve dialogue with the aliens? Maybe century sent message that we are not aware of. What are you these piles of paper? My diary of Colorado Springs. - What makes it different to and why you important? - Lots the addition of premonitions but if I would like us to answer where I would say that the water leads to permanent solving the problem of energy. Thank you, gentlemen. Enough questions. I'm so happy to be at second time to see the great; Among the major. Genius Nikola Tesla. - I'm sorry, but I do not remember where we introduced. - Mr. Tesla, my name does not mean much. Even as student, I listened to your lecture in London. This is my favorite memory. Allow me to introduce myself. I I Marquis Gulielmo Marconi. Glad, Marquis Marconi. How can I help you? Plague me some ideas, but do not can be formulated. It seems to me that you know it. Could I would use the area Telecommunications. - Lf you want to know, then you're good chosen path. Believe his instincts. Knowledge does not leaves, but you can seduce. - I came to America I you saw. Could I come near you and watch doing? - You are welcome. My lab and all my achievements are at can use. Thank you. Do that which is my great honor. - Czito! Ensure Mr. Marconi. Whatever you say, Mr. Tesla. Tell me, Tesla. Does anyone understand what you guys are talking about. At least I hope so. - I would should after all these years. For you energy is big problem possibilities. Matter of life or death. - Sources of energy now we use are not exhaustive. And poison our planet. I did not notice. - Will, trust me. Might survive to poisoning, but the day will come When will the first energy dry. And then what? All will machines fit? - Not to my the project. World can give all the energy you need, pure energy. - Stuff I was afraid of. - Color? Yes. I was afraid that I finally figured out what you're saying. But that rumor about psychological phenomena... I do not understand. These strange stories about you by newspapers. As of that guy. Brown, Commodore. - Yes. As the story went? Mr. Tesla told him not to must embark on a train he uiao. The train was Derailed the rails and all the he died. - Did it really happen? Some say that it could be a coincidence. I do not care! The public does not accepts mixing science and the supernatural. Or you are a serious inventor or gypsy who prophesies fate. I do not even cross my mind that people prophesies the fate and I'm not an inventor. No? I am a researcher. - Columbus? He probably looked exactly like you while jogging around before their discoveries. I guess the history was much Columbus went and never did not return. Is you along the way? For Mars? What are you talking about the press? To communicate with the Universe! There is a great possibility. - The Devil and your opportunities! Keep your speculation to themselves. - Not just speculation. No? While I funded, not I can not afford to think I teamed up with a lunatic. Comes Mr. Tesla. Get up! You'll again whiskey? - I'd rather with you drank a glass of champagne. Fine. Toast your new project. A toast to you, new ambassador in Rome. Our ship sets off at dawn. I will not go till you tell us all about project-There's a lot of say. - He thinks that there is nothing what he wants to say. - What are so many Secrets? It's Morgan's ideas, his condition! - Playing cat and mouse. Morgan is afraid of you... I am afraid that Morgana? Never. Maybe it should. Nick is convinced he will change the world. Hope to the right. Of course you I, -Neizjleivi optimist. I would not want to healed. You mean you do not want to ruin his dreams. A very've told him that confront with stvarnou. - My tower is a reality. We are on the threshold of the World War... The war? What about this war? I hope that this does not Tesla deals. You could invent something to send us the life ever. On the contrary, Mr. Twain. Instead of sending the battlefield people, we can send robots If you invent a machine that would instead we drank, you know that I'll fight to the death against you. I apologize. Do you really think going to be a war? - Not necessarily. No, if it was my mind. - Who knows? If one day it was luck, not war, we visit your far birthplace place Lika. See, I forgot the name. I wish you knew my mother. I would like to I knew you, Nicky. In a way that was not possible at all. I used to think that all possible. Do you remember what you mother say when you tried wings to fly from the roof your home? "You're not a bird, Nikola. You're the man." Do not talk about money. All will be prepaid. Morgan is behind us. Yes, Mr. Tesla. Mr. Tesla. I received an order to show you this. If you do not know. He wants to see you right away. There was firmly promise to which I counter. Pledge are we gonna be able to communicate over long distances without wire. And it was invented. But you have not invented, but some of Italy's... - Marconi. - With little boxes can talk with England. From it must buy patents. What if he stole the idea from You? You're not the only man with big ideas. There is also one Jew in Nemakoj... Einstein. Nauen whole world is talking about it. And in Paris. What's there? - They broke the nucleus of an atom. Whatever that meant. That's an entirely new source of energy. Energy from destruction natural elements of the crime against nature. We are at the crossroads. If we miss this opportunity, we will be considered culprits. - What chance? Commodore, we send energy the outer layer, the ionosphere. Energy of the sea, the wind, the sun. No longer must destroy. Just take what you already there We'll use this energy for all our needs. Inexhaustible. I really think this is possible? - All I proved it. One only needs to out in practice. - Adams! Yes? Adams? Yes, Commodore? - Have you see that? Yes, Commodore. A single source of energy. Is that right, Tesla? - Yes. And anyone can use this source. Earth-layer wraps the whole world. Energy will belong to all, as well as air. Moratemo consider some financial details. I will not detain you longer. I know you want to go back to work. This I will send you. Forgot I never handled. Just suppose that it is not crazy. He could reverse world upside down. Yes, he could order. This is a great feature. Listen, if this madman really can not do that, do you know what will happen? No, sir. - Postojae only one source energy... So, everyone can take energy, and we more will have nothing sell. We produce energy, our will horns milk free. No, thank you! For that I am not a benefactor. Write His letter, so be ready to sign tomorrow morning. - Good. And what should I say? What do you say? Tell him goodbye. After so many years, we are not responsible. I showed him what the world could be. He said that we would know when it is ready. I'm still waiting.
