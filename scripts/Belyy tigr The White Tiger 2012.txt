ALEKSEJ VERTKOV Vitaly KIENKO and VALERIY GRIKO KARL KRANCKOVSKI KRISTIAN Redl - Look. What is this? - As if Germany is not uniform. - Probably the Romanians and Italians. - Hungarians. - All are dead. - Hungarians and the Huns. - Look, did not stay in one piece. - See what they have left. in the film KAREN AHNAZAROVA WHITE TIGER Based on the novel by Ilya feared "TENKISTA" Music by Richard Wagner And where are your feet? Go there to look. Shut! What happened to you? The I 'out soon? Comrade Captain, they refuse to move. - What will you move it? - Hands. - Whose hands? - Driver. Driver? - I think he was alive, Peter. - Really. He is alive. Stop! - What's up? - Take it to the field hospital. - It is the 'dead? - He is alive. - Dead or alive, for you there is no difference. - Inserted it. Here! - And this is where to wear? - In the woods. You did not even review it. - It has a pulse. - Give it to the tent. Put it here. Yet I never saw anything like this. Ninety percent burns, but alive. They will not survive even two hours. Give the fat here! Hold right! Do not go in my legs. Hail. Where tenkista? - How long with us? - About three weeks. Ninety per cent burns, sepsis, and is still alive. Bring it to him previa. - And where are the burns? - A strange pathology. - Three days ago was not a healthy place to him. What is your name, soldier? Surname You know you're out of the unit? I do not know. - Let? - Yes, sit down. - Ivan Ivanovich Najdjonov. Year of birth - 1914th - Russia is not a party member, tenkista. - Wait... You said you had no documents, and that he remembers nothing, not. Thus he writes in an accompanying letter from Polish hospitals it said "unknown tenkista". And what you choose his name? We all call him Ivan Ivanovich. We decided that his name be Najdjonov, because it is written in the accompanying letter, "found in the tank. " Year of birth and a natural look to match? According to the teeth we found that there are about 30 years. The natural look... It is the 'reason? Here is some mistake. These are really his documents? - Its. - Here it states that it has 90 percent burns on it. Yes, that is, that is, had burns of about ninety percent on the surface of the body. -Is this a joke? - So where are these burns? - Listen, we can not to explain this fully, but the patient recovered completely. It is obvious that his body has some amazing features and no doubt this is a phenomenon. So, what do we do with this phenomenon? He possesses a rare case of retrograde amnesia. Remembers all his habits, remembers... alphabet can write, but can not remember who it was, where it is not remembers his family and what happened to him. I think it is okay to be discharged from military service. Tenkista? Forgot your command of the Supreme? I know. Write his hospital release form and send it to the tenkiste to fill the need through the people in tank units. I know, but here is a special case. The soldier has no memory. You do not need much memory to use the cannon on the tank. Soldiers! Come here! What is your name? Sergeant-Najdjonov - mechanic-driver of the other bands. And what are you doing here? This tank was destroyed by "Pantera". Inflammation in the ambush. Where did you know that it happened so? Well, I'm told. Who told you? -Tank. This tank. And this tank is I 'occurs you something? "Tiger," it is ignited. The same case as in my tank... "White Tiger". That means, the soldiers, chasing after the unit. Immediately! I understand. Je I'he know? -Yes, I know it. A very good mechanic, just as he left the hospital. - Something is wrong with the memory. - God knows who sent it to the front. Should have been sent to a mental institution... and they send him to the front. Give me a cigarette! Listen, Nikolay, I also heard about the white "tiger. " - We talk about it like that spirit. - Nonsense. Listen to me, it's all fiction. Stop! For this tank in our army are circulating legends. Continue. The battles in Bobruisk, we were attacked by Russian tanks. There were over 20 It seemed to clean up everything in their path. - Suddenly a tank appears from the side - "Tiger", painted in white. Tank T-6. He began to hit the Russian tanks, one by one. About 10 minutes it took him to destroy all Russian tanks and then disappeared. It looked as if he vanished. Did you personally see it? He himself did not see it. For this fight he told a friend who participated in it. The white devil you anything you can. And why? Because it is a triumph of spirit nemakog. aripov, wait for me here. was first observed in Polesietu. All "Tiger" stuck in the swamps, and he did not. He destroyed a tank battalion. Then it began to appear on the north and south. Whenever there is in our background, we consume three p. m. our tanks and locomobile and disappears into the woods. How is this possible? Fifteen of our tanks can not destroy a fascist? Will you allow me, Georgi Konstantinovich? This is not a standard tank. All thoughts are moving in that direction. Germans have a single tank. If accurate intelligence and technical data that we have, his armor is at least 250 mm. But then, should it weighs about 100 tons. The most powerful tank engine nemaki is only 700 horsepower. -Your proposal? Let's do what the Germans. Make a special tank based on the T-34-85. Put stabilizer and enable them to shoot moving targets. Ojaajmo armor and put a better gun. Deadline? Month-on. In this case, two weeks. Generale Smirnov, I give you orders. Find and destroy nemaki tank. Better known as "White Tiger". Download the new T-34, the crew assemble and rehearse. - I understand, Comrade Marshal. - Who will deal with this? Deputy Chief of Army counterintelligence service, Major Fedotov. - Choose the best, Major. - I understand, Comrade Marshal. Ivan Ivanovich Najdjonov. -Present. How do you feel? The hospital did you come? Normal. Through the zaleio as if nothing even happened. Devedesetoprocetne burns and cured Wounded in the leg, not even then did not want to withdraw. After three days is stopped. You're somehow special, Najdjonov. Trojans are. Probably, yes. I can not remember anything? First name, last name, where are you? No, I do not remember anything. Your entire battalion was completely destroyed. We tried to find your real name, but... - Do you want to know? - I would not say that much important. I Stepanov and Petrov, and became Najdjonov. I remember that I am Russian tank driver. What we need more of this? Family? Maybe you had a mother or father. And maybe a wife, children. If I had them, you should receive notice of my death. The dead do not return from the war. The dead do not need to be where they lived for life. I remember when he shot at me. The missile flew slowly and directly to me. I saw him that we are slowly approaching. I wanted to relocate. To turn left or go back But I could not... I could not push my own hands. You saw him? -Yes, I saw it. "White Tiger". We were all on fire. What is Najdjonove? He is dead, Comrade Major. As the dead? What you talking about? What is that tank? Top, size, armor? Well, the tank... Tank as a tank. Maybe a little better than others, but dead. I always have people in the tanks? The fascists, of course, but still people. We know that there are people in them. When people fight, and when frightened do not shoot, or if you are very brave, to gamble with their lives. And this is dead. I will not be afraid to strike, will make everything right, without errors. Yeah, right. There is no salvation. I recommend you as the best tank driver in the army. I will request that you be awarded the rank of lieutenant junior... and your appointment to the position of commander of the experimental tank T-34-85. The machine was an extraordinary one. With increased armor protection and improvement of the engine. The crew consists of three members: a gunner, loader and more. The task... Detect and destroy the tank "White Tiger". Tank commander, Lieutenant Najdjonov. Sergeant Kriuk, the best marksman. Small Berdiev, filler. Full top for 15 seconds. Gas that accumulates in the dome is absolutely no impact on the shooting. Have you formed a team? -Yes. And this is the best of all? -Best. Why? -Something about them... is wrong. What is wrong? -Well... - Simply no. - They will sit in the tank... and not on the scene, "Bolshoi Theatre". The commander and gunner, come to me! Do you see a barn? Aha. -How long does it take? Six meters. -Oh, six hundred? Six hundred and forty. -Okay. Destroys barn cumulative grenade. A maximum of two shots. I understand. In its place! Well? -SEEING. Yesterday he appeared behind the other corps. Right here. As I went through a swamp, it is not clear. But it is a fact. He appeared, burned five tanks and four locomobile, and disappeared. If you can comb a little ground to see where it happened. He was shot out of the woods. Immediately behind the swamps and forests. - A tank that can not be moving. - But he did. Here it is. - Where? - Somewhere in the woods here. He is hiding. Not there. Yesterday we searched the entire forest. We have combed through every meter. There is. What do you suggest? -We'll ambush him. But it will take us at least one tank. Is it possible to get a T-34? How do you know it's there? How? Tam, I'm going to destroy it, Comrade Major. Give another tank. aripov! Go to Kutaisi Brigade. You will give this command. I'll stay here. Comrade Major... Alexei, do not feel that crazy? Who? -This Najdjonov... That is crazy. -Enough aripove! Execute the order! Give! Give more. At your disposal, Sergeant Slepov. Najdjonov! Here is your commander, Lieutenant Najdjonov. Listen, hide out there in that grove. When it appears, try to drag it out in the open, shooting and doing the maneuver. I understand. -Hurry up! I understand. Sarge! Keep lids on the dome opened. Do not close completely. Here are major. Enough. Use, Comrade Major. -Thanks, I sit. Take. There for all. A commander? -It seems to me not to eat. How not to eat? -So. Take some bread... I do not think I cared for him. God protect him. As if bewitched. Shells have avoided it. Maybe with him and I Berdiev survive until the end. What do you think? Will you have some brandy, Comrade Major? We tenkisti, generally do not drink before the fight. Not worth it. How many young people just burned down because of alcohol. But Berdievu nothing missing. He is a bottler and a drunkard. Is not it so, Berdiev? - Do you think that will occur? - You will be presented. I am looking for. Slepov... Come on, Kriuk! If you destroy the T-34, and we are finished. Listen to my command! We are moving backwards. Then we move to the right and shoot him antitank beneath the dome. The I 'clear? -Yes. Lets go! Shoot, Kriuk! Shoot! No it anywhere! -How not? Shoot! I do not see it! Kriuk, out! -Where? Look around. Assess the situation. I understand. Commander, it does anywhere. No it, he went. No, Kriuk. It is not gone. He came back. Like this survive? From this distance in turn. Could one of us to make the porridge. Neither our helmets would not find. All right. Bring the console keys and bearings 27 and 32 Are you injured? Where is he? As he finished behind you? You think I scared? -No, Najdjonov. I do not think you were scared. If you would like to I thought you would probably end up being executed. They are easily outwitted you. Slepov has suffered in vain. You are my nemako reported that the "miracle of the tank" destroyed by our experimental tank. Yes, I reported to you. In that case, why his crew was not presented that they delivered rewards? Witness this battle was only one person... Deputy chief counterintelligence service, Fedotov. It is a fact that has not seen the destruction of the Tiger. The video is just how it affects our tank twice... - and then disappeared. - What does it mean, gone? The fight was held at the forest edge Karnilovske. Behind her is just a swamp. Tiger seems to have sunk in it. Looks? It need not be true. After the battle, Tiger has not appeared anywhere. Here are his marks. Here he was going backwards. No further trace. - And to understand this? - Assume that... passed through the swamp. It is unclear how, but it passed. In this case, on the other side would be identify traces of caterpillars, but there's not. Pioneers have searched every inch out there. No, Alexei. It sank. It is not possible to pull out of the swamp, but it's there somewhere. Najdjonov claims otherwise. He says he is gone. Najdjonov is nuts. Listen, Alexei. It happened and you know it. In this war, many people have gone crazy, while others will just mad. Do you pray to god that tank? Who? -God of all tanks. For him there is a God of tanks, understand? Hello! - Where did you here? - By the way. How are you? - Not bad. - Where can I find Najdjonova? Behold his tank. Sergeant Kriuk. Kriuk, if you get caught once with a woman in a tank - I will kill you in your place. The I 'clear? - I understand. Stop! What to wear, Berdiev? Vodnie Berdiev, I wonder what's in those bottles? This is Germany brandy, Comrade Captain. Yesterday I was in the basement of a neighboring village. Two barrel. -Berdiev, did not warn you Germans to leave behind a poisoned brandy? If we inflict losses in manpower. Is it tasty? Kriuk where Najdjonov? When the tanks. -Where the tanks? When destroyed. Here in the vicinity. This is ours. Destroyed by 1941st Najdjonove! Najdjonov, get up! Talk to the elderly act. Leave it, sir! Najdjonov? "White Tiger". - What does the "White Tiger"? - It is not sinking. There is. - That might not fly, so he flew the swamp? - Wait, aripov. Why do you think has sunk in the swamp? Pulled-out to be ready. Waiting. -What? What awaits us? -To start the offensive. Tanks God has told you? -Yes. And this God, where is it? In the sky. In the clouds. It has its throne and sit on it. And about all the tanks that were killed in the fighting. And how it looks... The God... He was in the suit, drops tenkista... He holds a T-34... Gold. When he finds it started thunder and lightning sevaju. Here, you see? It helps in the fight? -It helps me. I hear tanks. All tanks can speak. But one does not hear it, only I hear. They warn me of the shells, so that they can be avoided. So help me. They want to live. They want the "White Tiger"... be destroyed. To get revenge. I told you he was crazy? -You said to me. Do you understand now? -I understand. It should be disbanded this team. Najdjonov to be sent to the hospital, and Kriuk Berdiev and the other teams. They are completely dissolved. Why Stay calm? What do you think, Alexei? Nothing, I think. Go! Yes, I served at the headquarters of Inspector General nemake armored train groups. How have you fallen into captivity? They sent me to accompany a group of special forces the Ministry of weapons and ammunition. Then I caught you. What can you say about the tank "White Tiger"? Everywhere tell the legend that tank. Among us, the Wehrmacht, it causes more fear than hope. But believe me, during the tenure of Staff, I have not seen any documents that is at least indirectly connected with these "white Tiger". Maybe there is a responsible person to Hitler? No, it's impossible. I am absolutely sure. There is such a tank. Now what do you think? What I think is not possible. Go properly. One battery is sufficient. Comrade Commander, we have cleared the first ten kilometers. No fascists did not stay until the pontoon bridge. Clean, you mother... Who shoots? Where? Comrade Commander... - Give the order to withdraw. Quick! I understand! What? Is that it? Yes, Comrade Commander. He is. Retreat! Nothing is seen. -And where are we? When the devil. On his birthday. Kriuk, see the front of the barn? Aha. -The entire event with antitank the level of the dome. -I understand. Finished, damned! -This is not ours. This is the "quartet". It has arrived. -Yes, prokletinja. Now let's play. Done! Stuck his dome. Finish-ga, Kriuk! Not us exploded. Here is it? -Yes. Tell him. Come in. Hello, Comrade Commander. -Hello. Want to eat? -No, thank you. And to drink? -I will not refuse. Sit. He disappeared. - As if the country failed. - Perhaps the worse? Tough to top. A Nemake... crew does not sit in the burning tanks, you know. Are obliged to leave. I think that... no crew. That is what I think, Comrade Commander. You serious? To you I poured a lot? After the color I asked how Najdjonova is predicted when the "Tiger" to shoot. And you know what he said? Yes it is his tank warned. To apprehend, when tanks will be fired at them... and warn your drivers. Only you do not hear them all. And he means to hear? Are you insane? Listens tanks. And how else to explain his uncanny ability feel that the emergence of Tiger? How could you know that it will appear from the swamp? Waiting in ambush for our attack? You say you hate this Najdjonov "Tiger" because he has destroyed a tank? -Yes. Why then, when you already heard the warning of his tank, had not heard? Then he had no option. He was burned when he, Michael Efremoviu. How, burned? What do mean by that? People with the ninety percent do not survive the burns. Najdjonov was also burned. Burned and born again, but different, ideal for the war. Same as the "Tiger". So, Aleksei Alekseevich, believe in mysticism? In what I am saying no more mystique than in Darwin's theory of evolution of living organisms influenced by the conditions of their existence. Or you think that Darwin's theory of mystical? Darwin - I do not know, but I believe in God and the devil. In war, I believe. Although I am a Communist, and you. Remember, Major, my army is going in Berlin at 50 km per day and nothing will stop it! On the occasion of Darwin, I'll tell you this... Tired, exhausted. Hence you can think of quite such nonsense. I'll give you leave for 10 days. Regression and resting. When you return, you will win in Berlin. Stop, please! Stand here. Come in. Your posts are here. Ask nemake proxies that you are familiar with the act of complete and unconditional surrender. Yes. Are the representatives of the Supreme Command nemake agree to sign an act of complete and unconditional surrender? Yes. Delegation of Germany offered to sign the act of unconditional surrender. Let them come here. Would you like wine? -Yes, white. We have a tokai. -No, tokai is sweet. Then red. Baking is not bad. Interestingly, where they took all of this? I suppose that in a restaurant. It seems that this is the "lemera. " Have you been there, the field marshal? Where? -In "lemeru. " Restaurant. No, never. Come here. Come on, come on. What is this? Fresh frozen strawberries with whipped cream. You know, for the first time in my life I eat fresh frozen strawberries with whipped cream. What? What is funny, Stumpf? -No, nothing. Sorry, field-marshal. Absolutely nothing. Najdjonove! I'm guilty. I heard when you came... I repaired the cable. I see you have a full combat gear. -Yes. Even more. The yoke I still fourteen. Light. -Nemake? France. Where is the crew? -And where would be? Do you know where. We won. -Yes, of course. Devils! Totally will be missed. The war is over, Najdjonov. Have you heard? The war is over. End While it does not burn, War will not end, Comrade Colonel. There it is! After the Battle of the Vistula it does. He waits. Waiting... Will wait twenty, fifty, maybe a hundred. I will appear. It must be burned. You know that this must be done. We are too long and too well.. Too many of us that connects to I hide my thoughts from you.. war is lost. I know it. not just lost. Europe was defeated. But can you imagine what will happen tomorrow? Germany miserable. It will be blamed for all the deadly sins. Nemaki people will be to blame for everything. Napisae thousands of books. You will be thousands of ugly documents. Concoct hundreds of memories. And I, I, and Germany we will be before the world sole source of the evil of mankind, as Pyromaniacs hell. And we just found the courage to understand What Europe fantasy. We said: "If you think about it, Give to finally do it. " It's like a surgical operation. First the pain, but then the body heal. Do not we implemented the secret dream every European guild? Is not that was the cause of all our victories? All that we know what they are afraid to tell even their wives I posted clearly and openly, as befits a powerful and united nation. I always loved the Jews. Whole lives are feared the dark and gloomy forces in the east. From the centaurs and giant foreign Europe, Russia. I said, "Give to solve these two problems. " To solve them once and for all. Do we invent something new? No. We simply brought clarity in all matters for which Europe wanted clarity and that's all. Since the Earth rotates around the sun While there are heat and cold, storms and sunlight so long that there is a struggle among people and nations. Do other people have to live in paradise, he would have failed. Humanity has become what it is, thanks to the fight. War is a natural, normal thing. War has everywhere and always. He has no beginning and no end. War is life itself. War is the starting point.
