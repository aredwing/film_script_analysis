Cast Momojiro, First Star BUNTA SUGAWARA SAYU RI ISHI KAWA AIKO MORISHITA DAIJI R0 HARADA MASUMI HARU KAWA SHINGO YAMASHIRO Jonathan the Widower KI NYA AI KAWA Director NORIFUMI SUZUKI Watch it. You're too close. Momojiro, be careful. He's a reckless trucker. So this is the bastard. Hey, what the hell is this? So tasteless. Dog paintings. - Tosa Dog? - Why not Prince Shotoku? "Ashizuri Love"? What an uncool light. "A cool highway guy"? Yeah! Stop. Is that all you have to say? So you're the guy who challenged me. Wanna fight? Hey, what're you doing? You don't have to go that far, fool! You said I was tasteless. I know that. Momojiro! Damn you! You dog. Come! Nice doggie. Hey, Jonathan. Help me. I hate dogs. Stop. Ryoma, that's enough. Damn that dog, that shithead. CHOSHI HARBOR Hey, hurry up with it! Honey? We just got a job cal1'ying feed for fanned yellowtail to Kochi. I know you'll be lonely, but I have to go. That means you'll take the ferry from Harumi. Then why can't you come home for a night? Even just for an hour. Hey, be quiet! Darling. You know what will happen if you leave me all alone? I'm going to work in the sex industry. Not that! I'll make it up to you when I return. I'm still virile. I don't have any more coins. Hello? Darling? Darling? Damn it. "Ev, kids! Why can't you keep quiet when I'm on the phone? Ma. Are you really going to be a sex worker? Do that and build our own roon1 for us. - Please! - Please. Shut up! TOKYO HARBOR FERRY WHARF Jonathan. You exercise, too. Are you ill? You look down. Since I'm away so often, my wife's threatening to work at a sex shop. Don't worry. I'll go often and ask for her. Yes, thanks. Are you kidding? Oh, a lone seagull. No, a pair. Idiot, just one. 0h yeah? Are you dreaming? Get a grip. Bravo! That was great. You sing like a real pro. I am. What? A pro singer? Then you're on a concert tour of Kochi? Nothing that fancy. May I ask your name? Yuka Onogawa. Yuka Onogawa... What songs have you recorded? No records. I'm touring remote areas. Remote? I sing in cabarets to drunk customers. So it's no wonder you don't know my name. But you have a great voice. I was mesmerized. I can't believe the Japanese record industry isn't all over you. I'm happy you say that. I'm in transportation, but I once went to Musashino Music School. I'm really particular when it comes to music. So you studied classical music? No, I was in the Japanese enka song division. Enka song division at Musashino? It must have been lovely. Saburo Kitajima was at the bottom of our class. Then maybe you can teach me. I'm pretty rusty. Here, when there's a change in keys... the transition to G minor is so hard. Minus G huh? You, get up. Excuse me. And these high notes? I want to sing them legato. Dessert, huh? And here in, the refrain? I'd like a prettier harmony. Harmonica? Wait a second. Oh, 250 dollars. It's blowing away. Oh, no. - 250 dollars. - Oh, no. Leave it to me. I'll retrieve it. KOCHI Thank you. YOKONAMI SKYLINE Jonathan. What's wrong? Jonathan? Jonathan. What's the matter? Are you all right? Momo... My eyes are all funny. Oh, Kimie. You came. I delivered Jonathan's freight, so don't worry. What? He's gone? He's gone, Momo. I looked all over the hospital but he's not here. Oh no, you don't think... Suicide? CAPE ASHIZURI - Momo! - Momojiro! We found Jonathan. Oh, it's Momo. Momo. Fellow truckers. Thanks for your friendship. - Don't jump ' Stop! - Jonathan! - Don't. Not doing it. - Jonathan! - We're coming. Don't stop me. Don't. Fool. I understand how you feel, but think of your wife and nine children. I'm not cut out for this dirty world. Momo, forgive me for going ahead of you. Remarry Kimie. Take care of my nine children. MY dying poem: "At Ashizuri, the beach on a remote Tokai island. "I play with the crabs walking sideways." Don't, Jonathan. Ignore him. But... What? Take no notice. If we make a scene, he'll try even harder. Oh, I see. Hey, what a great view. Great! There was a jumper yesterday, too. I heard his head was smashed to bits. Smashed to bits... Are you kidding? Don't stop me. Mister, don't do it. Please don't. Mister, don't. Mister. - Jonathan! - Are you all right? You're all right now. You! You're his friends. Why didn't you stop him? You're heartless. Be kind to him. Understand? Yes. I do. Welcome. Hi. Coffee and cake. We don't have any cake. - That's all right. - Here's your coffee. What's her name? Yes, that girl... That's Fumiko. I'm Tamiko. Who asked you? - Oh, your change. - Fumiko. It's me. Thank you so much. You saved my friend. God knows what would have happened without you. Not at all. Your lecture hit home. I was very kind and took him to Suzaki Hospital. Has he regained his will to live? Yes, he's fine now. He asked me to come thank you. This is er... only from me. A bouquet for me? You don't want it? I'll take it. Give it to me. No, I'll take it. I do want it. - Here's your change. - Keep it. I forgot to mention... I'm Momojiro Hoshi. Let me take you home. Stay where you are. Fumiko, please. This is my house. Is that so? Thank you. Isn't it pretty, Ma? A very kind trucker gave it to me. You must be hungry. I'll go do some shopping. I'll be right back. Hello. Nice to meet you. You must be her mother. I'm the kind trucker. I gave her the roses. She really is a great girl. She's kind and cheerful and full of life. You'd never find anyone like her in a big city. She smells of the ocean. A really wonderful girl. Are you ill? I'm an authority in female ailments. I'll examine you. What's wrong? Your upper body? Lower? Please tell me what's ailing you. I'm asking you. Please answer me. Say something. Idiot! Get out! You old geezer. Coming into a stranger's house... You, too. Get out! I see. She has palsy and can't speak? Poor Fumi. I warn you. Keep you hands off her. She's my daughter-in-law. Your daughter-in-law? She's married? She's my son's wife. She's not for you outsiders. Don't hang around here. Leave at once. Is that so? I misjudged her. She acts so virginal. The flowers cost 30 dollars. This was 20. This purple slipper was special order for 50 dollars. That's why girls nowadays can't be trusted. A hussy with a face like that? Fumi's not married. She's a virgin. What? It's that man's wishful thinking. When his missing son comes back, he wants her to be his bride. Missing son? That's right. Fumi's originally from Kyushu. She's never even set eyes on Ryuji. So why would she marry him? That old geezer! Hey, you. You liar. She's no married woman. What are you talking about? I hear your son was in prison for a year. Who told you? Fumi who's pure and innocent can't many your yakuza son who's been missing for six years. He's not missing. He has a proper job. Someone told me. You can't trust rumors. Someone said he was in Miyazaki, someone saw him in Okinoerabu... I hear you went to Hokkaido last year hearing he was a sailor on the Shakotan Peninsula. All rumors. They're not rumors. The next news... You selfish bastard. Wanting Fumi for his bride. Give up. No, there's no one else for my son. This comb... has memories for you and Pa. What are they? Uncle next door said this time it's real. He's in Hanno in Saitama, so this time he's going to find Ryuji. He's very hopeful. I've talked to Fumiko. About my son when he was little, and when he was older, so she knows everything. But it's just talk... Girls these days don't wait for guys. He'll be back. I know he'll be found. Even if he is... you don't know if Fumiko will fell in love with him. Of course she will. My son will fall in love with Fumiko, too. They'll make a good couple. Ma? What's Ryuji like? According to Uncle, he's manly, cheerful, audacious but sensitive. Uncle's a doting parent. But... I wonder what Ryuji's really like. I only have photos of him when he was little. Whoa, he's a misbegotten son-of-a-bitch. Doesn't he have any distinctive characteristics? He has a dog bite on his shoulder. A dog bite? All right, leave it to me. I'll find him. But it's a guess whether Fumiko will like him... The way he looks. He's better than you. KACHO PLAIN This is First Star. Jonathan, come in. This is Jonathan Lady, over. Do you have enough gas? Yes, full tank, over. How far do you want to go? Namu Daishi, henjo ko go. Toilet go go? That's right. Please. So, toilet. You want to go? Yes. There's no toilet in these woods. Which is it? Dai (two) or sho (one)? - Dai? - Dai... Dainichiji (Dainichi temple). That's it. Dainichiji. Please. Dai, huh? Shit. Dai... Dainichiji Temple. Oh, the temple. - Thank you. - Thank you. Hey, there's no paper in the temple's toilet. No paper. - Bye. - Bye. Hello. Hello, Auntie. Can't be helped. Maybe they don't understand English. Hey! Hey, there. Momo! Enough already. I'm going to leave you here. Let's go together. I'll be back. Hey. I brought you some paper. Henjo ko go. Namu Daishi, henjo ko go... - Hey... - May I have some paper? Sure. It's Kleenex. 0h! Oh. Yuka. The singer Yuka Onogawa. I'm Hoshi, Musashino Music school graduate. You remembered my name. May I? How many do you usually use? - One. - One? Thanks. Hold this. Thank you. Every time I come to Shikoku to work, since I have free time during the day, I do a pilgrimage of the shrines. I see. I promised to go hear you sing and I've felt bad I haven't been able to. I only have three more shrines to go. When I finish, I know my wish will come true. What is your wish? Oh, let's ask her. Excuse me. Excuse me. Can you sing Goeika song? What? Goeika song. Goeika, song. Oh, I know. Yuka, for international goodwill sing a song. Please. Get up, get up. Get up. Hurry up and get up. You'll be late for school. Pa, don't worry about us. While Ma works, we're all pulling together. We each have our chores. So, Pa, just think about getting better. Hanako. Hanako... Konosuke. Kosaburo. Koshiro. Michiko, Saiko. I can't stay in bed. I'm the breadwinner of the family. I have to go. Damn these eyes! Got it. Damn it! TAKASHIMADAIRA DISTRIBUTION CENTER, TOKYO Kimie. Give me some water. Oh, Tosa Dog. Hey, you. How dare you sic your dog on me! Bastard. What? Wait a second. Are you Ryuji Kakiuchi? How do you know my name? I see. You undutiful son. Your pa in Kochi is worried about you. Go home. None of your business. I was born in Usuki Kyushu. But my pa was from these parts. Maybe he was homesick. He always sang the Nangoku Tosa song. How nostalgic. Pa was a pole fisherman. He met Ma at Usuki Harbor. That's when the song was popular. So it's their song. Pa died in a storm at sea, so we came here to to be near his relatives. Ryuji was gone by then. I warn you. Don't listen to that stubborn old geezer. Don't throw your life away. There are many men in this world including me. Even if there were, I can't marry. Why not? I can't marry with a sick mother. There's always a way. Men don't understand. She's bedridden and can't even talk. Sometimes I think we should just die. I would do anything. I mean, for example... I can't many. But if Ryuji comes back? - He won't. - You never know. He hasn't made contact in six years. Why would he now? If he wanted to return, he would have already. He won't. Ryuji won't. But his Pa next door and I keep waiting. Why? Whv Wait? We keep waiting. We'll wait forever. And eventually I'll be an old spinster and no one would give me a second glance. Fumiko, don't say that. I can't marry. Not with anyone. Fumiko. Fumiko. Fumiko, come quick. I stopped by your house and your mother... Ma? Ma? - Auntie? - Ma? Are you all right? Are you all right? I'll call a doctor. What? What's the matter? What is it? What do you want me to do? That record? You want to hear it? Just a minute. I'll play the Nangoku Tosa song now. It's broken. It's smashed. Ma... The record is broken. I'm sorry. Wait. I'm going to bring the best singer in Japan. Yuka. Yuka someone wants to hear your song. Leave these drunks behind and come with me. Hey, she still has a show to do. Yuka has a date with our boss. She's here. The best singer in Japan. Mother. She'll sing your favorite song. Please. Now sing. But... I... I never sang in a place like this before. Idiot. You call yourself a pro? You won't sing unless there's a band and lights? Is that the kind of singer you want to be? A true singer is one who can sing from her heart at a time like this. All right, Momojiro. I'll sing. If my song will do, please listen. "Leaving Tosa behind... "I've lived in the city for a long time. "I remember that the friends at home "sang the Yosakoi Song when I left. "At Tosa's Kochi's Harimaya Bridge "I saw a priest buy a hair ornament. "Yosakoi, Yosakoi... "On a moonlit beach sitting around a campfire, "we relaxed and had some time to enjoy. "I too, sang out loud "the Yosakoi Song of Tosa." Ma! Ma? - Ma. - Sing. Finish the song. Ma... "I'll show you, the best place in Urato "for moon watching is Katsura hama. "Yosakoi, Yosakoi. "My father back home caught a whale "off shore of Muroto he said in a letter. "After I do my best all clay "I'll sing Tosa's Yosakoi song. "Don't tell anyone in our pond "swims a fish spouting sea water. "Yosakoi, Yosakoi." Ma... Ma! I'm sorry. I bet you can't go back to that cabaret. It's all right, Momojiro. I found out how wonderful it is to sing to a single audience. A single audience? That it's more important and wonderful than singing to a roomful of people. That's the real spirit of singing. But they're cheap to put you in a place. This is better than nothing. Sometimes they make me sleep in the dressing roon1. I see. Being on the road isn't easy. In addition, you have to fight off those lechers. But if I make them angry, I won't be able to sing here. For them, a singer on the road is nothing. That's awful. They're taking advantage. I'll beat them up. I'm okay, Momojiro. I've been on the road long time. I see. But you want to continue? Yes, because this is what I aspired to. But I find I'm drinking more and more. The rain won't let up. Yuka. Where are you from? Even in my profession, money s everrything. Yuka. Shinobu. You're so drunk. They made a fool of me. I went to the store they told me to, and it was closed. Oh, no! I complained to the agency and he said he'll do better next time and made me go to a hotel with him. No! Who was it? Iwase. You're working at a cabaret he controls. Be careful. I hate this. It's so lonely. I'm mortified and so alone... Can I sleep here tonight? Sure, Shinobu. Am I going to end up like her? No... I'm so tired. I'm really tired. It's a difficult life. Momojiro? To tell you the truth, sometime I think about quitting. Quitting? And give up your dream? And just become a regular housewife. I think a lot about that recently. A regular housewife? Yuka. Thank you. I didn't know. You're leaving early tomorrow morning? I'll come pick you up first thing. That means I'll have to hustle. Ma? Go be with Pa. Darling! Kimie. Darling! I broke the light. I'm sorry. Why? Kimie. It's because you're such a good wife. Don't say that. It's only natural that a trucker's wife drives his rig when he's sick. Kimie. I'm so thankful. It's all right. You're making me cry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are you well now? Test results today show it wasn't a stroke, it was brain spasm. Brain spasm? It was transitory so the double vision was temporary. Then you can see my beautiful face again? Kimie. You're beautiful. You're a beautiful woman. Here's to Jonathan's full recovery from brain spasm. Cheers! Glad you can see again. Thank you for everything. We're so appreciative. Momo, are you really going to stay in Tosa? Yeah. I can't leave. Two women are counting on me. Momo, I won't steer you wrong. Come home and go to your favorite soapland and think this over. She's right. You're obsessed. Fools! It's the women who want me. Two women are hopelessly in love with me. You won't understand how hard it is to be in a love triangle. This is serious. Oh, the travails of a popular man. Be good to one, disappoint the other. Be good to the other and the other will cry. Either way someone's going to get hurt. But I have to decide. Yuka... Fumiko... Yuka... Fumiko... Yuka. Fumiko. KOCHI CASTLE Brother... I'm coming, too. What do you want? I... Do you live in that house? Yes. Is the man next door well? Yes, he goes fishing every day. So he's out fishing now? Yes. You're Ryuji, aren't you? Yes, it must be you. How do you know my name? What's the matter? Why didn't you come back earlier? Why didn't you write? Six years ago, I had a dog, a Tosa breed. It was full of fight and I adored that dog. He was scheduled to fight for the grand championship of the Kochi Dog Sumo Championship. The opponent dog was owned by Iwase, who owned Kochi's bars and cabarets. Long story short, my dog lost. He was mauled to death. They found poison in his system. A guard saw one of Iwase's men enter the dog house the night before. But there was no proof. I totally lost it. I'm glad you told me about it. You show up with that disgraceful rig and a dog. You're still dog fighting? I'll never forget. I didn't come to Kochi to see you. What? I came to settle the score for the dog fight six years ago. Forget it. You've already had a bad experience with dogs. I told you not to get involved with dogs anymore. I can't. Until I square that match, I can't move on. I want a rematch. You undutiful son. Get out. Unless you stop with the dog fighting, I won't let you enter my house. Leave, you stupid son. Uncle, stop. Stop. Leave. Get out. - Go! - Uncle, stop. Please. Stop. I'll never come here again. Uncle. Now that he's finally back... How could you! How could you! I have no use for that good-for-nothing. Go wherever you want. He's not my son anymore. Momojiro. Momojiro? Momojiro? Oh, Yuka. I'm happy you came. Thank you. I have a present for you. "Fourth Graduating Class Musashino Music School "Momojiro Hoshi" Please sit down. I want you to sing my song. I wrote the song and lyrics and I did the arrangement. "A ballad for Yuka." The motif of this musical piece came to me last night. The note may be hard to read but please sing it for me. "When I saw you my heart skipped a beat. "My smiling darling Yuka." "A first star rises over the road in the evening. "This world is full of momo (peach) and roses." That's a nice song. It's the influence of my mentor Master Furuga. What? Masao Koga 101 Songs Merry Christmas Golden Show. Tonight we have the new star of the song world. Let me introduce you to Mieko Hanawa. I thought I was to sing. Oh did you? You're not on the roster. Hey. Hey, you. Wasn't this Yuka's show? How long have you been on the road? You know you have no right to complain. Think about it. I'm sorry. There are plenty of itinerant singers. If one or two of them disappear... It's no big deal. Yuka, leave them. What? It's no big deal if one or two disappear? Us truckers are also on the road. We won't disappear so easily. Momojiro. I got this. Something smells. You're rotten to the core. Hey, how dare you. Don't touch me. Stop. Where's Iwase? Have you forgotten me? Hey, Tosa Dog. When did you come to Kochi? Oh, what are you doing here? Ryuji. What brings you here? I'm here to settle the score for six years ago. At tomorrow's dog fight, I want your dog to fight mine. My dog will tear that runt into pieces. Hey, leave. Damn you. Wait! Hold on. Hey. I was in this fight first. Don't interfere. Stay out of this. What was that for? How dare you? Hey, that man is my sworn enemy. Don't you interfere. All right. Interesting. I'll settle with you first. Now, round two. Stop! Please stop. Fool! Slop! Please stop. Momojiro, please stop. I won't be able to sing any more. Yuka. I've stopped. I'm sorry. Hey, Tosa Dog. How many time did I say let's stop? You caused trouble for Yuka. Damn you. That's not how it was. Tosa Dog! You win the dog fight tomol1'ow. I've been waiting six years for this day. I'll be cheering for you. YOSAKOI FESTIVAL Dog Fighting Championship The Grand Champion Tosazukasa Go will enter the ring. Today's final match. The association's Japan champion Grand Champion Iwafuji Go will accept the challenge of Champion Ryoma Go. If Ryoma Go wins, it will become the association's Grand Champion. Rvoma, go get him. Start. Use your teeth. Go, go. Get up, Ryoma. Go, Ryoma. Good, good. I'll cool you down. Here. Are you cooled down now? That's the way. Get up. Watch your leg. Good. Good. Go for it. Bring him down. Iwafuji loses. Let go. Let go. - We did it. - Good for you. Good job. We did it! You! Pops. Pops. Grand Champion License Ryoma Go That dog's got guts. Uncle Suisha, it was worth coming. Wouldn't miss it. Ryuji and I trained that dog since it was a pup. Those wimpy dogs are no match for him. Pops, this must be a huge load off Ryuji's mind. I'm sure. So where's Ryuji? And where's Fumiko? They both went toward the Ryugu shrine. So now, you have no regrets? Yes. I can finally go back to my old self. Ryuji? Please don't leave anymore. Fumiko. Are you sure? You'll take a man like me? No, don't. Momo! Momo. Not again? I told you. You can't even make one woman happy, this was bound to happen. Listen, half the country's population is women. You go for it. Half are women? I see. There's Yuka. Yuka was my real love. I'm going to marry Yuka. I've made up my mind. What? Perform in Osaka? I'm going to appear at Umeda Theater? That's right. Mr. Bernard wants to build a show around you. What Bernard Show? A fairy tale... A poem... No, but it's true. Mr. Bernard of Empire Records from America wants you for the show. Your manager is here, too. He smells money. This may well lead to a record deal. Trust me, I'm the smartest director in the business. Then your record under the Empire label will be sold throughout America. It'll even be in supermarkets next to cup noodles. I'll put Mr. Bernard on. Hello, Miss Yuka. Your enka song was so wonderful. Don't waste this opportunity. Mr. Bernard, it's you Thank you. Thank you. Yes, you want me there by 6 p.m. tomorrow. All right. I'll sing with all my heart. I'm so happy for you. You're going to sing at Umeda Theater. You finally got your chance. Do you best. I'll do it. I'm going to do it. Yuka. It's Hoshi. Momojiro Hoshi. Yuka? Yuka's not here. She went to Chikurin temple early this morning. That's the last temple on her pilgrimage. Last temple? Because of the pilgrimage, luck has come her way. She met someone here in Kochi. Someone? I see. Yuka said that. Here you go. Thank you. Yuka. Momojiro! Yuka. Momojiro, please be happy for me. - I... I... - I know. You don't have to tell me. Your wish has come true. That's right. I'm so happy. Lady Luck is finally smiling down on me. She's smiling down on me, too. Here. Oh, thank you. Our future is bright. A life of wine and roses. A life of wine and roses. I won't let you have a hard life anymore. I'll make you happy! I intended to all along. I should have told you earlier, but now I won't have to propose to you. Propose? Isn't it the tradition to celebrate with sweet sake when your wish comes true? Let's go. Momojiro. So well have three kids? One girl, two boys... Oh, maybe two girls are better. Um... In any case, we don't have to have nine, like Jonathan. Momojiro, I... Honeymoon in Hawaii? No, let's splurge and go to Vegas. Vegas? Yes, Las Vegas. You're going to retire from a long life on the road. To commemorate, I want you to see a real show. Momojiro. Maybe we should get married over there. You in a white dress at a church... I know you'll look splendid. I... I always wanted to wear Japanese kimono at my wedding. I see. If you say so, we'll do it Japanese style. That's right. I should be satisfied. To have someone love me so much. That's the best thing for a woman. I'll be a good wife. I'm not a good cook but I'll learn. I have a cast-iron stomach, so I'll eat anything you make with relish. Momojiro... I'm glad I came to Tosa. Me, too. Yuka. What are you doing? You have no time for this. What about Osaka? Never mind. It's fine, Shinobu. It's your big chance. Chance? You insensitive lout. Didn't I tell you? A big chance has come her way. She's going to sing on the stage at Umeda Theater. What? I made up my mind. I'm going to be an ordinary housewife. Are you serious? Yes. I'm going to cook for him every day and live an uneventful life. Are you out of your mind? What do you think all this hardship was for? You endured because there was hope. And you're throwing it away for a trucker? It's fine. Leave me alone. I'm saying it because I can't. It's not just about you. The dreams of all the itinerant singers are riding with you. If you quit, all our dreams will vanish. But it's too late. Even if I take the limited express, it's three and a half hours to Takamatsu. Yuka... Leave me alone. I'm going to be his wife. You said your wish had been granted. What was your wish? Don't lie to me. Tell me the truth. My dream... was to be a recording artist and sing in the spotlight. All right. Then go. Momojiro. Go to Osaka. Or you'll regret it the rest of your life. But it's too late now. If I don't get on the noon ferry from Takamatsu, I won't get there in time. There's still two and a half hours. - I won't make it. - Come. But, I'm going to be your wife. Shut up. If you want to be my wife, listen to your husband. Please. Stop the truck, Momojiro. I don't care about being a singer. I want to be your wife. Fool! Just think about singing. Stop. That's an order. Tosa Dog. I owe you one. Momo. There's a speed trap at the next junction. Roger that. I can't do it alone. Let me. You can't handle it. I want to try. All right. Try. Okay, give it some gas. Just a bit more. Try harder. If we can't get free, you won't be able to sing. Takamatsu Station We made it. Go. Get on the boat. Momojiro. When your record comes out, I'll buy thousands of them. So become a great singer. Thank you. I'll never forget you. Hurry and go- Momojiro, I can't. I can't go. Momojiro. Open up. I don't want to go. Momojiro. I want to be your wife. It's true. Open up. Stop bothering me. You're not the only one who's in love with me. There are lots of others. Like the stars in the sky. Momojiro... Miss. Are you coming? Or not? The boat is sailing. Even on city streets where colorful neon flowers bloom, there are small flowers that bloom quietly without being noticed. A single flower of the song world we are about to introduce did not succumb to the summer sun nor the cold winter wind and is about to bloom large on this stage. Her name is Yuka Onagawa. She's finally saying goodbye to her long itinerant life to sing on this stage. Let me introduce Miss Yuka Onogawa. Congratulations, Yuka. Thank you. Please say hello to the audience. I am so happy to be given an opportunity to sing on this stage. I am full of gratitude for all of you. I've worked hard to become a first-class singer. But until I met a certain person. I didn't know anything about singing. At this, my new beginning, there is a song I must sing. I will sing for the person. Who taught me the real meaning of singing and the song that taught me the real meaning of singing. Could I please sing the Nangoku Tosa song for you? "Leaving Tosa behind... "I've lived in the city for a long time now. "I remember that the friends at home "sang the Yosakoi Song when I left. "At Tosa's Kochi's Harimaya Bridge "I saw a priest buy a hair ornament. "On a moonlit beach sitting around a campfire. "We relax and have some time to enjoy. "I, too, sing out loud "the Yosakoi Song of Tosa. "I'll show you, the best place in Urato "for moon watching is Katsura hama. "My father back home caught a whale "off shore of Muroto he said in a letter. "After I do my best all clay, "I'll sing Tosa's Yosakoi song. "Don't tell anyone in our pond "swims a fish spouting sea water. "Yosakoi, Yosakoi." "A man always travels alone..." "A woman's path always heads home..." "Although the roads are never the same..." "Love brings them together at the crossroad." "Ah... "The first star in the sky "knows how I really feel." THE END
