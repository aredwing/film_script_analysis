Hey. There's my little girl! Hi. Hi. Sir, I just want you to know that I... Sit, sit. Okay. Sit, sit, sit. Great news. Just finalized the deal for 70 percent of Fillmore for the new resort and spa. Wow, 70 percent, that's phenomenal. What about the other 30 percent? Well, made the town a generous offer, and they've agreed to give it to us. Give? Yeah, you know, eminent domain. They're going to declare it a eyesore or blighted or something. It's standard procedure. Blighted? Fillmore, really? Yeah. Hey, I need you to go up there tomorrow and get the city council to agree to it, too. That's it. Bye, honey. Wait, wait, wait, sir. I don't really think I'm the right person for the job. What are you talking about? You're my number 1 attack dog. Plus, I mean, isn't it your hometown? Yeah, that's the problem. Oh, that reminds me. If we work the financing by New Year's, we have to have the paperwork filed before the start of the holiday season. Okay, I totally understand that, but, sir, I really think... Hey, kid. What? You're not going in this alone. Okay? Yeah. You've got the light of my life, and more importantly, I put together this. It's me, it's awesome, and play it during the meeting. You're going to be fine. It's a small town, and I haven't been there in a while. And besides, I had that really special thing planned for this weekend. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry I'm being so insensitive. If I were you, I would do that special thing on the way home, after you've made the deal and pleased your boss. You know? Do that. Yeah. This guy! I see, you know... Please. Have fun. He's... He's fantastic. I know. Well, guess we're going to Fillmore. When the Christmas lights are twinkling And the glistening snow has fallen Sleigh bells keep a perfect rhythm for A Christmas dance with you Time's suspended, hold me closer Underneath a starry blanket I'd give anything, including the moon For a Christmas dance with you I can't remember a feeling like this Such heavenly bliss Intoxicated by your kiss And if you should ask me I'll say I don't mind So were you able to reschedule the other thing we talked about? Well, once we wrap this proposal, then we'll get started on the other proposal. I knew you'd work it out, buddy, Hold on a second. Yeah. That's great, you're kidding. That... that's fantastic news. Hold on a second. Uh-huh, sure. Okay, I'm back. So tell me, what is the big plan anyway? It's perfect, it's this great little town in Connecticut. It's... where we went on our first date. You know what? That reminds me of my second wife, when I proposed to her. I had the Blue Angels write up in the sky... We were in San Fran, and we... Uh, you know what? Wait a minute, maybe... It was Tel Aviv because it was in Hebrew. So it had to be my third wife. Right, but it's just as romantic, I hope. Well, you know what I always say... actions speak louder than words. Yes, they do. So do you have, uh, it on you? It is a $15,000 ring, and I'm not letting it out of my sight. 15,000. You got off easy, buddy, but I'll tell you what. My daughter's going to be very happy. Very happy, indeed, son. Call me when you wrap this whole thing up. Will do. I'm still here. Yeah, he's right here. I don't know. He was on the phone. I don't know who he was talking to. Honey, I want you guys to have fun tonight. And it could be a big night, so keep me posted, sweetheart. Thanks. Bye-bye. I love you, honey. Carriage signed on to anchor the new shopping development. Yes. But before you start signing any leases, remember what your father said, that in order for us to get the financing by the end of the year... Get the paperwork filed before the financiers leave for their holiday break, blah, blah, blah. You are so cute when you get nervous. Nervous? Who said anything about being nervous? For what you're about to do to their property values, this town should be kissing your butt, ex-girlfriends included. Yeah. Santa Claus is on his way In a sleigh Hip, hip, hooray! I can't wait for Christmas Day Hey. Morning. Hi, Lisa. How are you? I'm good, good. How are you? Good, just getting the rest of these flyers passed out. Oh, my Lord. You never stop working. Oh, I'll rest when those Malones find another place to build. If I know Rick... Oh, don't worry. I'm ready for your son, that little son of yours. Well, that's good because they're coming. What's this? Is that her? Aww, I can't wait to meet her. No, get back in the car. Ugh. No, no, no. You must be Lisa. Hi. Lisa, this is... Reagan Malone. Like my flyer? Wow, 30 seconds, and already with the tone. Tone? I don't have a tone. I was just asking a question. I'm just trying to help my town. What's so wrong with that? Your town? Oh, I can't call it my town anymore? Oh, sure, since you've been here a whole two or three times since graduation? Too busy for 15-year reunion... your town. Look around. This place needs us. Reagan. I'm going to call Maria. She's lovely. Why don't you just admit that you're afraid of change? I am not afraid of change. You are, too. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. I'm not. You are, too, that's why you wouldn't leave the town. Oh, really? Really. You know what? I hope you're prepared for tonight, okay? I'll see you later, there, city guy. I hope you're ready for tonight, country person. Okay, great, you should watch your mouth. You watch your mouth. Ready, at least more ready than you know. Can you hear me? We're so going to have to wire this town. I know. Mom. Hi, honey. Oh, it's so good to see you. Good to see you. You look wonderful. Thank you. Mom, I would like you to meet... Reegan. Reagan. Reagan, I'm so sorry. It's a pleasure to finally meet you. You, too. So how is everything? Oh, everything is great. You know, no snow. So, of course, there are no people on the hills. Well, that's what we're here to change, right, baby? That's right, babe. You know, um, could I just speak to you for a moment? Just... Yeah, sure. Babe, could you go inside really fast? I just need to talk to my mom. Thank you. Please, make yourself comfortable. Isn't she great? Oh, yeah. She's so pretty, yes. There's something I really wanted to talk to you about. Do you actually have to do this now? Mom, I told you, you're going to be fine. We're going to put you in a brand-new building with plenty more rooms. This is a great location. It's going to be great. I-I actually like where I live, you know? And, um, it's really hard to start over when you're 60. You know? Mom, I'm not going to go through this with you again. Okay? Okay. Okay. Good. Now how long can you and Reegan stay? It's Reagan. Reagan. Actually, we're gonna leave right after the meeting tonight. Oh, now, come on. What is the hurry? I just have a couple things that I got to take care of. It's good to see you. It's good to see you. Oh. Come on. Let's go. Okay. I think that we'd like to thank the church for the use of the hall, of course, and the ladies of the synagogue for all the fine refreshments that they've supplied. Yea, thank you. They are a great bunch. It's good to see everybody here tonight. It's a great turnout, to say the least. You all know why we're here. It's pretty important. I guess we should call this meeting to order. That's Wayne Beauregard. All he ever used to do was play scratch tickets. I swear, he'd get 20 of those things a day. Now, it's my understanding that Alexander Malone would like to address the town, Am I correct with that, Rick? Yes, Mr. Mayor. Traitor. Shame on you. You grew up in this town, too. Yea, thank you. Who is that? You don't know her. She's new. Oh. We won't have any more outbursts like that, please. Okay? Uh, where is Mr. Malone? Is he here? Actually, we have a DVD. Well, I-I was under the impression he was going to be speaking for himself. What does a DVD have to do with this? Well, I'll just turn it over to you, Rick. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to present Mr. Alexander Malone. Malone. Progress. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I just want to say it's an honor to be with you tonight. I want to share a vision that I have, a vision for Fillmore... Fillmore's past, Fillmore's present, and Fillmore's future. Now I love the intrinsic small-town values that you have. I really do. And that's why I decided to make it the site of my newest development. Now, I was looking around, and I noticed that there's something really important missing. Maybe you've seen it, too. Snow. Now you can't call yourself a ski town if you don't have snow. No snow, no skiing. No skiing, no customers. No customers, no cash. And why should we rely on Mother Nature for our prosperity? I mean, what has Mother Nature done for us lately? Earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunami, not to mention global warming, and it's real, folks. Now here's my vision. of the future of Fillmore. A beautiful 5-star resort and spa open 12 months a year, snow or shine, packed full of people. Busloads of senior citizens driving up there. Can't wait to spend their Social Security checks, great cell phone service, free wi-fi, plenty of jobs... I know what you're thinking. We don't want to lose our small-town charm. We don't want to become too rich. Folks, that's what I love about this place. We're not going to lose the charm. And you can never be too rich, believe me. We're going to make it better. That's right, together, we're going to have more small-town charm. When you hear the name Malone, I want you to think progress. It has truly been my honor to be with you this evening. Thank you very much, and I hope to see you all in the future. That was quite impressive. Lisa, would you like to make a rebuttal? Yes, Mr. Mayor. Please, Lisa. Lisa. Oh. I'm kind of nervous. Hi, guys. Um, so are we talking about our town of Fillmore? Or are we talking about some new theme park? But, Lisa, come on. I mean, our schools are overcrowded. Our fire and police department, we really need equipment that we can't afford. I second that. Right. And you know, so do I. But there are ways of finding funding, without all of us having to sell our homes. We have always been a town about helping each other, a community, a community of families. Rosemary, remember when you lost Bruiser? Yeah. Everybody helped look for him all night. Yeah, and they found him, right? Let's think about the small businesses, the local business owners like Joshua. Joshua, who has run our local pharmacy for what, 20... 25 years. 25 years. So Fillmore doesn't need progress. No, because thanks to each and every one of us in this room, we have exactly what we need... everything right here, right now. Yeah. And Casey, who has run that dry cleaning service and listened to our pro... Everything we need? Well, yeah. I mean, I think everything we need. Do you remember when you had pneumonia? Yeah. What about it? I had to drive all the way to Lincoln. Okay, he had to drive all the way... 15 miles to Lincoln. Okay, so we're not perfect. But it doesn't have to be that way. You shouldn't have to wait for medicine just because Joshua's store is out of stock. No offense. Okay, and is that how you judge the quality of life? I see, probably so. But we don't. We're a family. And we've always been a town about being there for each other, and being a community. And I guess that's something that you, and her, and Alexander Malone will never really understand. Listen. I think it's great that you all helped find Rosemary's dog Why not have the best of both worlds? Why not be quaint and efficient? Alexander Malone is not trying to steal the character of this town, or its spirit. He... We... are just trying to make it better. Thanks. Well, I guess that's it. We'll let you know what the results are. Meeting's adjourned. Thanks for coming. Good night. Daddy, it was amazing. The bill passed 6 to 4. Yes. I will call you when we're back. Bye-bye. Uh, two words. Two words. First word... Pregnant woman. Pregnant Godzilla woman. I just want to see my mom for two minutes. Why can't we just leave now? The Rickmeister! Hey! Hey! What are they doing here? Maybe I, kind of, sort of, invited them. Oh, you look great, right. Oh, look at the love. Ow. Yes. Come in, come in. Okay. Look who I found. Hey. Hi, Mom. Hi. How are you? Hey. Hey. Hey. So, um, I heard you did a great job at the meeting tonight. Yeah. You did a great job in there, too. Well, you won. Well, I hope everyone has an appetite because I made my very special holiday pie. - Mmm. - Mmm. God bless you, Maggie. Yummy. Mmm. So, Reegan, what do you do? Uh, Reagan. It's Reagan. Reagan, what do you do? I oversee the design of all of Malone Development's construction projects. Actually, the spa was my idea. Rick was showing me some pictures of the town, and I said even though it looks like a real pit, we could probably do something with it. A pit? What she means is that we're really excited about improving the town. Right, sweetie? Yeah. So Lisa, I hear you're an attorney, too. A lot of pro bono work? Wow. Well, yeah, I guess we can't all move to the big city and be ambulance chasers, can we? As a matter of fact, Rick happens to be one of the youngest, most successful attorneys in his firm. And after this proposal, he might even make partner. Small price to pay for selling your soul. All right, that's enough. Let's go. Come on. Oh, no. No, no. Rick, wait. Rick. Wait a second, Rick, please. These are your friends. They care about you. Sweetie, can you... Just give me a minute, okay? Reagan's a really good person, Mom. Oh. Look, I'm sure she is, but, you know, she said some rude things about the town. Can you keep a secret? Yeah. Oh, my... Is that real? Yeah, it is, Mom. Well, I-I didn't know it was this serious. Yeah, that's why we've got to get going. I've got a whole surprise waiting on the way home. I've got a whole breakfast planned. Wow, I... I didn't know she meant this much to you. Yeah. Listen, I love you, okay? I'll, uh, call you in a couple of days. Bye. Bye, and, uh, good luck, huh? Thanks, Mom. Will you slow down? We've got a schedule to keep. But that doesn't mean you got to get us killed. We can still get there. What are you talking about? Oh! Aah! Make it stop! I'm trying! Are you okay? I told you to slow down. Great. Just great! Great! I can't get a signal. What are we going to do? I have no idea. Will you stop looking at that thing? This is a real emergency. I didn't bring enough luggage to get stuck here. Oh, I'm sorry about you and your luggage. Just get out of the car and see what's wrong. I'm gonna get out of the car and see what's wrong. You're such a baby. Ugh. Great! As your office manager and bookkeeper, it is my sworn duty to tell you that we can afford to turn up the heat. Oh. I come bearing warm beverages. Okay, okay. I'll turn on the heat. Just trying to save a couple trees, you know. Hot chocolate. I love you. Mmm. Did you hear what happened to Rick last night? No, I hope it was painful. His car broke down trying to get out of town. I don't have time to worry about Rick Kirkland. I've got to build a case to stop this Alexander Malone from bulldozing our town. So I was doing some research last night, and it turns out that there's a four-day grace period before the resolution is finalized. What exactly did you have in mind? Find anything that doesn't smell right, and file an injunction. I love working for you. Jingle bells Jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun It is to ride In a one-horse Dude, it's an $80,000 car, okay? How much? $80,000 car. Wow. It's all right. I'm the best mechanic in Fillmore. You're the only mechanic in Fillmore. Then it's a good thing I'm the best, isn't it? How long is this going to take? Well, it's going to be a while before I can get a new a new tranny. There's a guy down in Lincoln who deals in imports. So I'll give him a call. It's still going to be a couple of days. I'll probably... I'll just rent a car, okay? No, no. Chill out. Stay with your mom. She certainly brought enough clothes. I'll have you and Sleeping Beauty out of here in no time. I am so ready to get out of this town. She smells like flowers. Yeah. Smells good though, right? Let's go. Okay. I'll be here fixing. Okay. All of a sudden, they don't have any German parts or whatever. I've got that meeting at 4. Oh, hey, Mom. He's never been able to relax, not even as a boy. He never stops working. Well, his father was the same way. Look at the bright side. You get to spend more time with your dear old mother. Delicious as usual, Maggie. Oh, thanks. Thanks. Hey, you should watch your back, kid. Oh, yeah? Why is that? Your ex-girlfriend called this morning She wants all the files I have on your proposal. She's up to something. I don't get what the big deal is. Well, maybe you should talk to her. She doesn't want to see me, Mom. Maybe you could apologize. Apologize for what? Well, Reegan... Reagan, uh, said some not-so-nice things about the town. She didn't say anything that wasn't true. You catch more flies with honey. That's all I'm saying. Let's eat. Okay. I'll take care of her. Don't worry about it. I'll handle it. Come on. Let's go have some breakfast. Hey Cass? Did, uh, Marilyn ever call from the Mayor's office? This is really fascinating. How did you get in here? Cass stepped out for a sandwich. I told her I'd keep an eye on the place. Well, excuse me, my files are none of your business. Oh, well, being that Mr. Malone is a client of mine, I'd say that you're wrong. Come on, what do you think you're going to find? Well, who knows what you people are capable of? You people? You do know my proposal has nothing to do with you, right? Then why are you in my office? Well, I don't know, I just thought that I'd apologize. Oh, please, please don't insult my intelligence. I feel bad. I shouldn't have run out on you guys last night. Okay. Apology accepted. Now leave. I'm being serious. Why, what happened? Your mom give you a guilt trip? Obviously, I made a mistake. Good, we agree on something. Bye-bye. You know where to find me. Hey, you. Hey. Yeah. Hi. Hi, Lisa. I'm in here. You're packing already? Unbelievable. I can't believe... I'm going to have to put some of this stuff in storage. I never thought I would see the day. Look. Here's something. Do you remember this? It was his favorite jacket. Yeah. Yeah. You know, he came to my office today. He said he felt bad about last night. Oh, good. Well, I'm sure... I'm sure he does feel bad. Yeah, I think it was more like he was trying to get a good look at my files. You know, come here. Sit down. Sit over here. You just... some things you just really... you really just have to let it go. You know? And... His... His leaving the town is not the same as his leaving you. Yeah. But, you know, I mean, when he came to visit you, he could have said hi. Instead, he just always avoided me. Well, he... he probably didn't know what to do, you know? It's just all in the past. This building has been around since the early 1900s. Wow, that's Fillmore? It is. See, the big tree was the only other thing standing there besides this place. Wasn't until 1907 that they made that tree the symbol of the town. And I guess they're gonna probably tear that down, too. See, I don't know why Rick wants to ruin everything that makes Fillmore so special. Well, he just thinks he's doing the right thing. Sometimes in life, things happen for a reason. Hey. You're going to love it. What the heck did you do to my car? Oh, I gave it a complete overhaul. I scrubbed everything nice and clean, except for, well, I don't really know what this one does. I don't need it nice and clean, I need it running. Running. They're backed up down there, okay? But Billy's got a cousin who lives up in Conway, and she's going to drop off the part tomorrow afternoon. Tomorrow afternoon. No, no. Probably late. Hey, look, Rick, I'm doing the best job I can here. Is that a local call? Dude. Go ahead. Hey. Kirkland, when you getting back here? The financiers want to sit down and talk about a few things. Uh actually, it looks like I'm going to be here for a little longer. I told you, you could just rent a car. Would you... shh. Listen, no future son-in-law of mine is going to be stranded in Mayberry. I'm sending a car out to pick you up right now. That's not necessary. I think it might be a good idea, you know, to bond with the people. I don't know, how about, uh, a conference call? Bonding, yeah. Okay, conference call, day after tomorrow, 8:00 A.M. Got it? Uh, day after tomorrow. Uh, yes, 8:00 A.M. Okay? Okay. Okay. Done. Bonding. Yeah. So, um, where's the new girl? Shopping, pouting, who knows? It's not her type of place. You want some advice? Not really. It's like on Animal Channel. Everyone knows how the cute little meerkat's going to act in its natural habitat, right? But what happens when you pull it out of its element? Will it live? Or will the big mountain lion come up and sink its teeth into its neck and just... And the meerkat's just... Bite it, and kill it, and... My point is you got to keep your eye on the meerkat. Has anybody ever told you you're really weird? No. Look, it's like you and Lisa. You guys were tight, right? Everybody thought you guys were going to end up together. Lisa's in her habitat, and Reagan's in her habitat. What about you? It's not about anybody being in or out of anybody's habitats, it's just that, I don't know, Lisa is one of the most pushy, stubborn women I've ever met in my entire life. So thank you, Jack Hanna. Hi. Hi. Hey. Funny. Yeah. I'm going to go to work. Yeah, that's a good idea. Okay. All right, I admit, I haven't been exactly fair to you since you've been here. Well, if I didn't know any better, I'd say that sounded like apology. Look, you're stuck here. Can't we just try to get along, at least? If only I had my camera to document the moment. Oh, very cute. Truce? Truce, huh? Yeah. You know, we're all going bowling later, so why don't you come, and bring what's-her-face? You mean Reagan. Yeah, whatever. No, not whatever. Her name's Reagan. Whatever. Whatever, you. Really? Yeah, really. Okay. Are you coming or not? Yeah, we'll be there. Okay, good. I'll see you later, then. Okay. Bye. Lisa, do you know what this is? Doesn't that go to your moped? Oh. Right. Oh. Okay, I got one bar. Oh. Hi. Carol? Dad, it's me. We were just talking. Carol, is that you? No, it's Reagan. Dad... Oh, Reagan! Sorry, my bad. So what are you gonna do? How are you gonna fix this? Don't you love the mountains? You always loved going to the Hamptons. No, I don't. There's no mountains in the Hamptons, and I don't love the mountains. Since when do I love the mountains? Just go tobogganing, or whatever those people do and come back with Rick in a few days. I don't want to come home with Rick in a few days. We're stuck here. You don't understand. The car broke, and they don't have the parts, and it's just stupid. Everyone's stupid here. Hello? I'm losing you. You know I can't get a signal in the yard. No, no, no, no, no. Are you there? Don't hang up. Are you there? Dad. Sweetie... Dad. Look, why can't we just rent a car? We could leave tonight. Babe, we want to show that we're sincere, right? If we want to demonstrate good faith, then you what I always say. Actions speak louder than words. Hey, guys! Hey! Rick! Good to see you. What are you doing here? I invited them down. They have a bar. I am dying for a Belvedere Martini. Excuse me. This should be interesting. Awkward. Hey, you want to hear a little story about Rick? Sure. So in high school, Rick had this sack, right? And we were climbing to the top of the bleachers filled with water balloons. And then the sack burst! Boom! And there was water all over his sack. This isn't what I wanted. Just drink it. No, he didn't! No, he's not! Then he took off his pants, and he had underwear that was wet. Underoos! Because you guys know. We don't know what his... He's exaggerating. Man, I miss the good old days. That's plenty. I think my water's going to break. Let's bowl! Let's do it! Yeah! Whew! Oh! Oh. I suck. You don't suck. You just had too much to drink. No, I haven't. That's a bad ball. That ball is bad. That's not a bad ball. Yes, it is. No, it's not. Hey, you are a lucky man. You miss that? Are you kidding me? I got a nice girl. She's great, she's beautiful, smart... Baby, what are you doing? Just checking some e-mails from work. I don't feel so good. Baby, you okay? I had fun... Ooh. Huh? Oh! So what do you think? I think it's working. Did you see the way that he looked at her tonight? Yes! Yes! It was good. Oh. Now you sure you can stall him long enough? I'm sure. He doesn't need to know that I have the part already. Shh. Besides, little by little, he's starting to open up. Just like we planned. Mm-hmm. Bowling, check. Hockey, you'll get that tomorrow. Check. Cass, we are doing the right thing, aren't we? Of course we are. They belong together. We just need them to realize it. You're so right. .Thank you. How did it go last night? It was good. It was fun. You know, old friends and old hangouts. Definitely triggered a memory or two. Really? Well, that is good. Yeah. Well, so what are you up to today? Oh, well, you know, I have to finally get my tree. It's ridiculous. Why don't you let me get it for you? Really? Of course. I'm gonna go get mine today, anyway. Oh, that would be so good, because you know what? I don't know what it is. I think it's the cold, but my hands... Can I come? and to take that axe... Can I come? What? You want to come? Yeah. It sounds fun. I haven't really gotten to see much of the town, so maybe you could show me around. Sure. Morning, ladies. Oh, hi, honey. Hi, Ma. Hi. Good job bowling last night. Oh, thank you. I have something to show you. You're gonna love it. Hey. Hi. Look what I found. It's my old jacket! Yeah. It's hideous. Excuse me. There you go. Wow, it still fits. Yes. Oh, it's wonderful. You're so handsome. Thanks, Mom. So, uh, what were you two conspiring about? Lisa and I are going out. Oh, and where is it that you two BFFs are going? We're going to get a Christmas tree. My tree. You're not taking her to the place with the... you know, and the... Oh, a little girl time is a good thing. All right. I'm gonna change. I'll be back. Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. Oh, honey, sit down. I will get you breakfast. This is mine. Okay, spill it. I offered to go get your mom's tree, and then what's-her-face asked if she could come along. Her name is Reagan. Let me tell you something about her. She grew up on 5th Avenue. Her idea of Christmas spirit is shopping at Rockefeller Center. Perfect. Sounds like a blast. Bad. This is bad. We wish you a Merry Christmas Look. Help me. You gotta help me look. I am looking. I don't see anything. Why don't we just... Why don't we just go to a lot? I don't understand why we have to do it this way. Why don't we just go? They're already there for us. We pick the prettiest one, then we go home. I don't understand what we're doing. Because finding a tree is an experience. It's not just... it takes the fun out of it if you just go to a lot and pick a tree. Oh, and this experience can't include paved roads? Well, what do you do with your family in New York? How do you guys get your tree? Daddy has people who... Hold on. I am holding on. I don't even know where I'm supposed to be holding on. This thing isn't helping much. Aren't you glad you came? Yeah, this is loads of fun. I'm gonna wipe you across the ice, my friend. Okay, so why are you wobbling, then? Not my size. Right. You always skated like a girl. Are you okay? Easy, old-timer. You're not 18 anymore, Rick. Are you kidding me? I'm in the prime of my life. You know what? They got shuffleboard over at the senior center. Why don't we go over there? Bring it on. She really is something, huh? Yeah, she's definitely not the girl we went to high school with. Dude, I'm talking about your girlfriend. Oh. Oh. But you thought I was talking about... Stop it. Oh, really? This is interesting. So what happened between you and Rick? What do you mean? Why'd you break up? I don't know. It just... after law school, we kind of decided we wanted different things, you know? He wanted to go to the city, and I just wanted to come back here. So that's why you left? Well, he invited me to go with him, but I belong here. He did? What if we went out that way? You know, you didn't have to leave. You could have stayed. She could have come with me. You regret it? You kidding me? I got a great girl, I got a great job. We gonna play or what? Oh, yeah. Oh, right up here. Look, look, look, look. It's like you're working for the man. What about your independence? I've got plenty of independence. Dude, you'll be, like, this Malone guy's son-in-law. Dude, it's not like that. I'm actually really happy with where I'm at right now. So you have no regrets of any kind? Nope. I mean, as long as I can make a difference once in a while, I feel good. And you know what they say. Actions speak louder than words, right? Whose proposal was this, really, huh? Yours? The important thing is that I'm in love. Oh. Then why are you still here, huh? You could have rented a car. You could have... Gotta laugh, man. I know why. You like it here. I got it. Okay, you got it? You good? Yeah. I'm good. You do spend a lot of time with his mother. Maggie? Yeah, we're really good friends. Yeah, but she's your ex-boyfriend's mother. Yeah. You know, she's really been there for me, especially when I lost my parents. So you shouldn't let it bother you. That's all it is. Look, it's over, okay? I'm with Reagan now. He has his life, and I have Fillmore. Period. Okay. You want to try? Yeah. Are you sure? Absolutely. Be careful. Please make it soon You know you have to actually hit the tree, right? I know you have to hit the tree. Suddenly your name jumps into view Oh! Are you okay? Christmas Eve Santa sends an angel to me Oh, I ruined my manicure. Your manicure? Look what you did to the poor tree. Oh, just help me up. Yes, look at that. That was so cold. That's where we went skiing on Cannon Mountain, remember? I remember Cass broke her leg. No, I didn't. Yes, you did. No, it was a sprain. It was... And she had to go down in the toboggan with the ski patrol. They were so cute. Who was cute? No, not as cute as you, honey. Oh, thank you. Oh, Rick, you were good. Oh, no. Does he still play guitar? You play guitar? Well, a long time ago. He was a rock star. Yeah. I got a good idea. I'm gonna go get the guitar. No. Yes. No! I'm gonna go grab it. Where is it? Yeah! In the attic. In the attic. I'm gonna go get it. Whoo! That's so good. He's totally putting me on the spot. While you two were out behaving like a couple of Neanderthals, did he happen to say when the what-do-you-call-it... Transmission? Yeah. Well, it's a foreign car, baby. It's gonna take a couple days. A couple of days? What is taking so long? I don't know. Would you just relax? Oh. Uh, Maggie, let's go check on those cookies. Very good idea. Whoops. Give me a push. Don't hurt your back. Nice. Lookit. Remember that? Lookit. That's so silly. You remember how much you loved to sing karaoke? To pick up reindeer food I still do. And I'm good. Did you hear that? Unh-unh. Oh. Who will feed all those reindeer? Who is gonna double-check that list? And who will call the weatherman Make sure that sleigh is spic-and-span? Who is gonna wrap up all those gifts? I been waiting all year long For months I ain't done nothing wrong I hope Christmas saved those phones If Santa's on his own He's lost some weight He's melancholy And Santa just ain't Santa What is going on with your hair? And then everybody started doing it. You were out there. I don't know. Oh, my God, look at you. Look at your hair. Oh, wow. A little Whitesnake. Yow Right, right. What did you do to her today? Who? Reagan. I didn't do anything to her. That girl's crazy. She thinks that you and I still love each other. Insecure. That's ridiculous. I know. Where did everybody go? Cookies. Oh. Where's the guitar? What? The... the guitar. Oh, I couldn't find it. Oh. It's a big attic. Okay. Well, I will see you boys tomorrow, okay? But... Don't go. No, no, no. Hey. Yeah, I have things to do. Bye-bye. Yeah. Yeah. Where did Lisa go? I don't know. She left. Can I just have one? Sure. I'll be back. Where is everybody... Where you going? For a second there, it felt like it was years ago. Oh, Mom. She left it. She's so funny. She's just trying to save the town, that's all. Oh, you think that's all, huh? Well, I think she's more interested than that. Really? Well, It does... it doesn't matter. Andy's gonna have the part in a couple days, and it's fine. You know, whatever you decide, I will always stand by you. You know that. Really? Really. I love you, Mom. All right, let me help you clean up. You were a good guitar player. Oh, come on. Yes, you were. All right, all right, all right. Okay. Do you like the cookies? Are you kidding me? No. Of course I like the cookies. All right. You always make great cookies. What? What's the matter? I am so sick of being in this town. I just want to leave, and I don't understand why they won't let us. Babe, we're trying to. He's fixing the car. He's not trying. He's not fixing the car. You're so nice with him, and not even aggressive or anything. Oh, my God. Would you stop being so dramatic? I'm not being dramatic. You're dramatic. You're being dramatic. I'm not being dramatic. Sweetie. I just want to go home. I have things to do. I know. I'm sorry. We weren't supposed to stay this long. And you act like it's no big deal. We're gonna get out of here really soon, okay? Rick. Rick. What? Did you know something about a conference call? Oh, I forgot. Yeah, well maybe if you weren't busy getting all nostalgic. Not now, not now. Whatever. He's on the phone. You better get it. This is Kirkland. Rick. This is Rick. Oh, hey, Kirkwood. You know we had a conference call today. The investors kind of wanted to hear from you, son. I know, sir. I'm sorry. I forgot. Yeah. Is there a problem over there? Is it too much peppermint schnapps at your grandma's house? Or too much Kahla in the egg nog? What's up, buddy? Uh, no, sir. Everything's fine. That's good. I want a full report, then. What's the status? Is it signed? Is it filed? Where are we? I'm processing it in my laptop as we speak. Good, because the financiers want it on their desk by the 25th. Don't worry, sir. It will be there. Okay, that's good. Now, Reagan says we can start demolition in February. Yes, sir. "Yes, sir"? Is that the best you can get? You should be celebrating, son. This is the greatest day of your life. It is. Because of you, we took that piece of crap piece of real estate and turned it into a gold mine. You did this. You made this happen. You changed everything for your whole town. It's all because of you, son. Right. Because of me. That's right. Enjoy it. Go ahead. Listen, when people hear the name Malone, I want them to think progress. Of course. Of course. Well, you know what I always say. Actions speak louder than words. And that's why I'm willing to consider letting you hyphenate your name when you marry my daughter. Like the Kennedys, you know. Slash Shriver, Kennedy, you know how they always do that. So that we don't forget, you know. It's cool. Uh, well, I'll be sure and get you an update tomorrow. Whatever your last name is, hyphen Malone. Okay. I will, uh, talk to you soon. Have a great game. Putt well. Bye. Bye. Reagan, have you seen the paperwork? Put it over by the barn, honey. Okay. Yeah, I got it. Oh, you're so strong. She never laughed And she never smiled she didn't have a friend Wouldn't go outside to play She didn't even care about a holiday I need some egg nog. Rick. Rick? Hi. Hey, Ma. Hey. we're getting ready to go on the hayrides. You remember how fun that was? They have music and games, and the whole town gets together. I haven't been to that thing since high school, Mom. Aw. I think we're gonna stay here. Why? I don't understand. You used to love it. I'm not that same guy anymore, Mom. Oh, come on. What about Lisa? What about her? And... and Cassidy and Andy. I mean, all your old friends are gonna be there. They'll be so disappointed. Come on. Well, why not, Reagan? You'll love it. Oh, don't tell me you're actually thinking about going. Well, you know, it could be fun. Right? Yeah. Whatever. All right, look. I think we should probably go, okay? Okay, yeah. Great. Say hi to Arnold the pig for me. Okay. Well, I'll see you downstairs. Okay. 'Bye, sweetie. Have fun. I will. You, too. I wish you would come. Let's put the lights up on the tree The white snowfall from a windowsill And let's make a snowman You and me And dress it up just like an Eskimo You know my favorite gift is you You know my favorite gift is you You know my favorite gift is you Hey, guys. Hey. Hey. Hey, I've been trying to call you. What's the deal? Yeah, well, it's the funniest thing. I got the part in, but it's the wrong one. So can you believe it? The wrong part? Reagan's gonna blow a fuse, dude. Well, it's the Bavarian model. There's a Bavarian model? Oh, yeah. And, um, well, you see, the intake on the piston it is backwards, so I've got to swap it out for the German version. Oh, but don't worry. Don't worry. It's all gonna be fine. I'm sure we'll get the part tomorrow. Yeah. Sure. Probably. Hey, here's Rosemary. Rosemary! Here we are. Hi. No, no, no. You guys... You guys stay here, and we'll catch up with you later, okay? You guys have fun. We'll see you in a bit. Well, where you going? Okay, that was weird. Yeah, that was weird. Um... So... Do you want to dance? What? Do you want to dance? Polka? Yeah. I don't know how. Do you? No. Come on. It'll be fun. Come on. Everybody, everybody. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You know what I'm saying? Some of you know me, and some of you don't. That doesn't really matter, 'cause this is my buddy Rick. Yay! Yay! Yes, yes! Yes, yes. Okay. So, uh, this goes out to a certain special someone. Aw. That was pretty sappy, but here we go! All right. Sing it, city boy. Dashing through the snow In a one-horse open sleigh O'er the fields we go Laughing all the way, ha ha ha Bells on bobtail ring Making spirits bright What fun it is to laugh and sing Our sleighing song tonight Ho! Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way Oh what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh Oh, thank you very much, Fillmore. Fillmore! Fillmore! Whoo! Give it up for my buddy Rick! Yes! Thank you, everybody. Thank you. I am getting down now. Okay. Thank you. All right! Mosh pit! That was so funny. That was so silly. You know, I haven't picked up a guitar in years. Remember the last time when we were out here, after that hayride? Oh, yeah, and that guy... he saw us making out and he was like, "I'm gonna tell on you." You were scared. Oh. Whatever happened to us? What do you mean? I don't know. I mean... what do you think would have happened if we hadn't broken up? Well, I don't know. What do you think? I think we'd probably open a practice right across the street from the doughnut shop. Doing what? I don't know, a little bit of this, a little bit of that. Being absolutely broke and miserable. Hey. It's not the same as it used to be. I know. You can still do it, though. That's important. Well, you could have talked to me before you left, you know. I know, but I just knew in my heart that you didn't want to come with me. Yeah, but we always talked about coming back here after we graduated. Remember, we said we were gonna open up a practice in town. Yeah, I know. Then I get this note with this ultimatum. I wouldn't exactly call it an ultimatum. You wouldn't? What, "Come with me or else." What? Well, I guess I was just looking for something more than this town, you know? Yeah. Guess I could have put more thought into that. I couldn't really figure out what you were thinking, you know. You were the only thing that kept me from leaving. But I just knew in my heart that you belong here, you know. This town is lucky to have you. You know what? I guess it's probably really nobody's fault, what happened to us. We probably just grew apart from each other, you know? Yeah, but... I shouldn't have... I shouldn't have just left. You deserve better than that. I shouldn't have... Uh, I gotta go. Um, I had a great time, and, um, I just... I can't do this, okay? So I'm gonna... I'll talk to you later. Okay. Said you don't have to worry I'll be coming home soon Now I'm counting backwards It's like the Middle Ages. Oh. Huh. Dancin' through the snow In a one-horse open sleigh Over the fields we go Laughin' all the way Slippin' and a-slidin' Bells on bobtail ring Making spirits bright Good morning. Oh. Who woke up on the right side of whose bed this morning? No. Yeah. You and Rick. I'm right. No. No. Yeah. Didn't. Didn't. Didn't. Held hands. Oh! Danced. That's it. I swear. You knew I'd tell you. So, uh, did you get those voter rolls and the minutes from Marilyn? What's wrong? Really? Okay, now if you look at a map of the town, you can see that most of the land Malone's interested in is already owned by a company called Cabrera Enterprises. Now, it's old farms, woods, mostly worthless stuff. Just a very small part of it is actually eminent domain. Right, okay, so this Cabrera Enterprises comes in and buys up all this, like, so-called worthless property and then sells it and makes a killing. You think it's a coincidence? Not really. Okay. So what are you going to do? Well, let's see who owns Cabrera Enterprises. [MaggAnd... Here's your coffee. Thank you. you are Coffee for you. Thank you, Mom. That's all right. Oh. Hi, Lisa. Uh... That's funny. I don't remember inviting you to breakfast. What is it? Cabrera Enterprises. Cabrera? What's that? It's not illegal. What's not illegal? What are you two talking about? Your girlfriend here didn't tell you? Her boss created a dummy company to buy up all the land in Fillmore. What's that? Do you want to tell him, or should I? Okay, remember how I told you Daddy bought land from the town so he could start construction on the resort? Yeah. What about it? The people had no idea who they were selling their land to. What? But you told me that they were excited You told me that they sold this land willingly. You lied to them? You lied to me? How could you do that? It's a good thing. Everyone's property values are going to skyrocket. I trusted you. I don't have to defend myself to either one of you. Look, I swear I didn't know anything about Cabrera Enterprises. Do you know what the problem with you people is? Oh, "you people"? We're gonna start with that again? You're way too flexible. You know, you manipulate all the rules so that things go your way. You bend things so much, I don't even know what to believe anymore. Technically, it wasn't illegal. Oh. So that makes it right? What else, Rick? Is there anything else you want to throw at me while we're at this? I... I was going to propose to Reagan. What? On the way home, we were going to stop at some place, and I was going to ask her to marry me. Okay, there. I said it. So you mean this whole time and last night... Ow! You're a jerk. I don't know anymore. I'm confused. I'm lost. What are you doing? You think these people are your friends? What are you talking about? Five days. Five days we've been here waiting for that... that meathead to fix the car. You see this? Do you know what this is? This is the transmission for your car. I found it online, and for an extra 15 bucks, they're gonna deliver it tomorrow. Online? Any idiot could have found this. Like you can really criticize... I don't know what they were trying to do, get you to change your mind about the town, get you to fall back in love with that little do-gooder? I don't really care. I was a good sport. I played along. Now I'm done. So are we leaving or not? Reagan, I don't know if we're going to leave right now or not. Then go tell Cooter to fix the stupid thing so we can move on with our lives. Who's Cooter? Your little friend from high school. His name is not Cooter. It's Andy, okay? He's my best friend. Whatever. Andy is a loser. Wha... Baby... Are you coming home for Christmas? Should I keep the fire bright? Are you comin' home for Christmas this year To make the season right? A windy chill from morning air And the days are growing short You know my heart would come alive Just to see you walk through that door Are you coming home for Christmas To trim our Christmas tree? 'Cause the only gift I wish for this year Is to have you home with me Are you coming home for Christmas? Are you coming home For Christmas? I know how important this town is to you. It's where you've got all your memories of your mom and dad, but he can't take those away from you. All right. I'm sorry. I hope... I hope you'll at least talk to the baby. The little baby. I don't know what you mean. I mean... You know, you and Andy, you live this amazing life. It's perfect. And you guys are going to have this baby. Right? I just... don't know... don't know when I get my second chance, you know? I don't know when I get my second chance. You want to know what's funny? Can you believe I actually started to think that all of this stalling, all of these delays, were part of some great plan of yours? I feel like such an idiot. What are you talking about? Oh, please. Daddy told me right after you asked for his permission. What? He told you? Nothing's private between us. Wha... What is it with you two? I can't even surprise my own... It's unbelievable! I don't... You know what? You know what? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know anymore. I don't know. You love her, don't you? What? You've been thinking about that small-town tart since we left. Easy... Actions speak louder than words. Isn't that what you always say? Why do you love me? What? Why do you love me? Because. Why? Because. We have similar interests... food, decor. We make a good team. We're a power couple. That's not love, Reagan. Oh. And you and Lisa. I suppose that is, right? Yeah. Ow! Reagan! What the... Reagan... After everything I did. You did? I set up the real estate structure. I set up the business plan. I made that deal. And you? You just blew the single best thing that ever happened to someone like you. The town? I'm not talking about the town. Lisa? Lisa. Hello. Lisa. Look, I know you don't believe me, and I don't care. We're gonna stop this thing together. What? What about Reagan? What about your big proposal? I changed my mind. Look, I don't care how mad or disappointed you are in me. I realize that I love the way that you fight for what you believe in. I love the way that you feel about this town. I love the way that you snore a little bit and your left eyebrow goes up and it looks like you're asking a question. I love the way that you feel about this town. I love the way that you make people feel. And I love, most of all, the way you make me feel. I've always loved you, and you can't take that away from me. I don't know what to say. Just say that you'll help me stop this thing and save the town. Okay. Come on. We have a lot to do. Okay. Cool. Okay. So what few people know is that Malone has to close the deal by 6 p.m. tonight in order to get the financing he needs to start the job, so that gives us four hours to find something, anything, that could stop him. Well, this is everything we've got. Zoning laws, environmental reports, property rights. We've been going over it and over it. Malone will do anything to take this town. If we let that happen, everything that's special in this town will be gone. Okay. Let's do it. Oh, boy. It's Christmas time again Let all your good cheer in It's Christmas time It's Christmas time again The stockings are hung, and the tree is trimmed The sounds of the season are ringing on in It's Christmas time It's Christmas time again Well, I meet my baby by the mistletoe But, boy, don't you know? She'll be so happy When Santa comes tonight It's Christmas time It's Christmas time again You know, it's Christmas time It's Christmas time again Oh, it's Christmas time It's Christmas time again Lisa, I'm sorry, babe. 52, 52.92... We're going to get going. Sorry we couldn't help you pull it off. Yeah. Come on. Let's go, babe. Come on. Well, we gave it our best shot. That's the most important thing, right? Trying to make things better? Yeah. Can I ask you something? Yes. Yes. What made you change your mind? What made you come back? Well, after we broke up, I guess I never wanted to come back. But I don't know. I guess I just thought that I didn't need Fillmore the same way that you did, you know? Okay, and now? Maybe I was just trying to force myself to grow too fast. Maybe I just needed some time and space, like that big tree in the center of town. Can you believe that our initials are still in that thing? Yeah, I know. And you know what else your mom told me about that tree? It became the official town symbol after the inn, in 1907, which means... think about this... in 1907... Yeah? Oh, it means that the... How long is that? 1907. That's over a hundred years, so the hotel is over a hundred years old. Which makes it what under the National Preservation Act of 1966? It qualifies for national landmark status. Which means... This house sits in the middle of the street, so Malone can't take this house. Can't tear it down, no matter what. That means we have to find a certified historian to make the nomination. Where are we going to find a certified historian in the middle of the night? Harry. Harry. Ha ha! - Coming! - Oh! Hi. Sorry to wake you. Lisa? Harry, you're the president of Fillmore's Historical Society, correct? Yes. Yes, I am. And sole member. Perfect. Okay. I need you to nominate the Fillmore Inn for national historical landmark status. Wait. National historical landmark status? Can I do that? Well, as the town's leading historian, yeah, of course. I guess that was $25 well spent, huh? Where do I sign? Oh, uh, here and here. All right. All right. Done. Okay. Mr. Coggins, as your counsel, it is my duty to inform you that, in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, you are hereby prohibited with interfering with said property until such time that the nomination can be reviewed. Gladly. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you! Go back to bed. I will. Good night. The first Noel Merry Christmas! The angel did say Bye, Harry! Was to certain poor shepherds In fields as they lay In fields where they Lay keeping their sheep On a cold winter's night That was so deep Noel, Noel Noel, Noel Born is the King of... Did you hear about the Heritage Valley Inn? No. They declared it a National Landmark. You're kidding. I signed the papers myself. Way to go, Harry. Hey, I wonder if Maggie's got some coffee. Oh, I could use it. I heard they're gonna try to get more school funding from the state. That's amazing. That's what I heard. We can get computers for the kids finally. Yes. Yes, yes. Oh, that's great news. Malone was trying to get Rick on the phone this morning. This is gonna be good. Now, I want a bike and a model airplane. Do you still make those? Okay, good. What? I've been good. I told one lie. That's it. Are you really that nervous? I can't even eat. You can do it. It's ringing. It's ringing. Malone residence. Yes, this is Rick Kirkland calling for Mr. Malone. Is he expecting your call? Yes, he's expecting my call. Just a moment, please. I'll hold. Kirkland. Kirkland, tell me why my daughter's back home crying her eyes out. The town has declared the Heritage Valley Inn a national landmark, sir. You know what? I don't give a f... figgy pudding. What do I pay you for? Undeclare it. Not this time. Kirkland, I'm going to assume that it's the high altitude in the boonies that's got your brain scrambled. I want you to do your job and do it now. I want you to take care of business. I quit the case. You know how this affects your position at that firm, then? I quit your case. It means you can take your self-made, self-important, arrogant butt someplace else because it is not welcome in Fillmore. Uh, bad news, honey. I don't think he's coming back. I'm going to miss him. You just quit your job. I know! Crazy. I know. Uh, come here. Come here. Okay. I know what it is. Cassie. Come on. Let's go. Move, move. Out, out. What are we doing? Um... This is the proposal I should have done a long time ago. Lisa Donahue, will you marry me? Absolutely. Hey, would you look at that? When the Christmas lights are twinkling And the glistening snow has fallen Sleigh bells keep a perfect rhythm for A Christmas dance with you Time's suspended, hold me closer I won. I won! I won! I won! I won! Ohh! Ohh! I've won! What? I won! You won! I won! I won! I... O'e
