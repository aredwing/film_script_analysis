For God's sake... Only... Illuminated only by the street light... ... the dim light of street lanterns. Hell. CENTRAL PARTNERSHIP MAGNUM MOVIE COMPANY present KONSTANTIN HABENSKI VLADIMIR MASHKOV CHULPAN HAMATOVA in the film of KAREN OGANESYAN bTHE GHOST/b Script OLEG MALOVICHKO SERGEY YUDAKOV Director KAREN OGANESYAN Get out of here. Sasha, have your people gone mad? See what they've done? It was all white, and now it's all red. "Suddenly the Ghost understood that he has been unmasked." - Are you drinking again? - I don't drink, I consume for creative process. To no avail. It's crap. Have you gone mad? Wait. Wait! Have you read it yourself? - This? - Yes. I must've read this 5 times already. - Good morning. - Sasha, yes? - Yes. Nice to meet you. Yes, yes... I'm listening. Please enter. Jenya, please make us some coffee. Maybe you should try writing using both hands? Give it a try. [Advertisement poster reads: September 22nd presentation of new book "Revenge of the Ghost."] Dear customers. On the top floor of our store you can get an autograph from the writer Anton Prachenko. - Hello. - Hello. - What is your name? - Ira. Glorious name. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Hello. - Hello. - I read your book. - How was it? Total crap. I regret wasting 100 rubles on it. Earlier your writing was much better. - What is your name? - Egor. You should read comics, Egor. Maybe someone will like it. Excuse me, but I'm not Sorokin... Thank God... That's alright. Hello... - What is your name? - Anton. Have you yourself ever killed? - I do not understand. - I ask have you yourself ever killed? I am a writer. I write books. I wish you the same. Dear customers. On the top floor of our store you can get an autograph from the writer Anton Prachenko. What's wrong? Has something happened? Wait... - They are all killers? - Professional ones. This one at the bookstore also a professional? From the top ranks. - Fulfilled the client's special request. - What? A bullet in the mouth. - So he wouldn't talk... - Look. What were we talking about? About nothing. You haven't met him before? Don't think so. Okay. Try to put together a composite sketch. Today in the center of Moscow an audacious double murder took place. In front of dozens of passersby Anatoly Shmelyov and his bodyguards were shot dead. Shmelyov was supposed to be the main witness in the Filipp Yagorsky trial, but the prosecution has not yet established a connection between those two facts. "Revenge of the Ghost" "Anton! Good luck! Prachenko." I think the eyes are wrong. Not those. I don't know... Can we do different eyebrows? So, how's it going? Able to do it? I can not remember. He had this face... Also he was in a baseball cap, and it was dark. I can't remember. I see. Leave a business card. If you remember anything, please call. At any time. After the initial shock passes, some details surface. Please wait. I wanted to ask... Maybe it's silly... But I would like to write about it. If it's possible to consult about it later. You have a strange muse. Stop creating a myth around the Ghost murderer. - Hi! - Hi. Come here. What's the occasion? A celebration... - Romantic dinner. - Dinner? Wash your hands, take off your coat. - But today is Tuesday. - So what? We can not see each other only according to your schedule, right? You're quite excited, I see. Can you imagine that two people were killed right in front of my eyes today? "Imagine... Two people killed... " - It must be the new title of your book. - No, it really happened. I was signing books at a bookstore and saw everything through a window. It was so simple... Simple and beautiful. Most importantly it was completely different. All my life I've been writing about this, but I have never seen it, can you imagine? - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm okay. I just have to write it all down right now before I forget anything. Let's have dinner and then you'll write it all down. Vika, once in a century I'm having the urge to write. Once in a century I have made you dinner. - Vika. - What? Maybe I should just leave? Vika... - Your favorite salad. - Thank you. Vika! - You know I can't work when... - And my favorite wine, right? When someone is around. You don't even remember what day it is today! Why I don't remember? It's Tuesday. Tuesday? What are we celebrating today? Exactly a year ago we met. Exactly a year ago. Do you know why you don't remember? Because you don't care. And you don't care about me too. - Vika, you could have warned me earlier. - And take your keys. - Let me call a cab, Vika... - Go work, don't be distracted. The beginning, the beginning... Yes, exactly. He was lying down on the asphalt, and his right arm was turned palm up. As if the victim before his death had decided to turn up to the heavens for help. The last thing he felt were the drops of rain on his face. One fell into his mouth, and he felt its taste. The intense taste of moisture and childhood. Yes? Yes, yes... I just... I'm stuck in traffic. I'll be there soon. Damn... What are you honking for? Can't you see we're working? Get outta here! You want problems? Get out! I see no reasons to keep Pasha here. Can you understand, I'm currently in a difficult situation... I think it will be better for him here. - You're the father, so you decide. - Thank you. Hi, warrior. Come here... - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Alright. - And what's this? - Chupalino. Chipolino? (Cartoon character) - You've come again for 5 minutes? - No, no. Today I'm all yours. Till evening. - So what are we going to play? - I don't know. You don't know? I know one very dangerous game. - Shall we play? - What's it like? You must choose the tallest tree. Shall we choose? Which is the tallest? - That one. - That one? Okay. Excuse me. - May we climb that tree? - No, you may not. See, we can't. Not allowed. Let's go. In that case let's do another game. You have to find... The killer has been to the bookstore before the murder. Why do you think so? He's too well aware of where all the cameras are placed. Writer! Do you know the weather forecast for tomorrow? What? I'm asking if you know the weather forecast for tomorrow. What weather? My umbrella broke. I need to buy a new one. If it's about the police, I promise... I said nothing to them. That darn thing! - Forget about the cops. - Really, I told them nothing. Right on. Let's go. - I've been skimming your novel. - And what? You write well, only there's zero truth to it. - But the people buy it... - Yeah, I've heard what these people say. Do you like it yourself? The book is probably not the best, just... I had this period... I see. - Helps? - Not really. Want a real story? We'll make a book. You serious? This is nonsense... That's not what I meant to say, I... Why are you offering this to me? Who else? You're the expert. Why do you need it? Bored. Not afraid that I will turn you in to the cops? No. You're interested, aren't you, writer? - Good day. - Hello. - Paid the money? - Yes. The rest on Saturday. Drink, it'll be good for you. They write about us. Hi. Hello. What's that for? We are going to have something like an interview, right? What interview... Don't get ahead. Start by telling me how you write books. Where do you start, how everything takes place. That is... quite a creative process. It requires solitude, concentration. Just like my job. Then what? Then the main thing is to invent a story, the characters, their personalities... Interesting. Will you order something? - Black tea, please, and a doughnut. - Which doughnut? - A delicious one. - Okay. Listen to this true story. Just a second. There were two friends. They had a common business. One liked amusements: the casino, ladies. As a result of such a life, got into large debt. To pay the debt he had to sell the business. The friend was standing in his way. Then he, through his connections, finds a killer, which he of course has never seen. He leaves for him an an agreed place the money and a photograph of the friend. And his friend... turns out to be the killer. He receives the front money and a photograph of himself. Imagine the scheme? Theme. Well, yes. Keep listening... Hold on. Maybe you can you tell something about yourself? What's there to tell? Work - home, home - work. Still. Work is just work. No worse and no better than others. But you are no truck driver. Are you on about the "mortal sin"? It's the people who order my services who fight among themselves. I just put the period in their relationships, that's all. Okay. - What is important in your work? - Everything is important. - Except emotions. - Why? They interfere. One moment of doubt and you're gone. Most important thing is the result, right? You see... You can kill anyone. Not getting caught is the challenge. You... Can you not kill? Can you not write? Probably not. Simply... Don't know how to do anything else. Then why do you ask? There he is. Thanks, you can go. You know, it's actually not bad. Honestly, not bad. I'm serious. Of course I have a few comments here. - Where? - Let me find. - One sec... - Where? Probably left them at home. I'll tell you later. - Anyways, I'm gonna think. But the general feel... - Are you going to think long? I have another place. Okay, why right away... Hold on. Will you be thinking long? Anton, if you continue writing like this, it's gonna be a hit! Keep working, stupid. Why was I called? Will you be long? We're working on it. Yes, I understand, going there now. Yes, I wrote down the address. So? - Have you remembered anything? - No. I told you everything. You never met the killer before? No. I think I told you this already. So what did you speak to him about? I don't remember. Am I supposed to remember everything? Not a single camera captured his face, only because he knew exactly where each of them is located. This means that he has been there before. Maybe even tried meeting you there. Or maybe you did? What meeting? Tell me, are you suspecting me? You think you are writing books, right? No. With all this you're making a criminal into a hero! A legend! Listen. Some brainless kid will read your novel... and then will take a gun and go out into the street to shoot. Think about that. Okay, I'll think about it. Is that all? Free to go... For the time being. Goodbye. The Ghost did not work through intermediaries. He found a big fish in the criminal world and offered his services directly. Only to disappear after several orders. But once he made a mistake, turning to Vova Dager. Dager worked for us. Next everything went according to our plan: we gave him an order, pointed to a victim. Hold on. So it's you who captured the Ghost? His dead body. There was a chase. He tried to escape and fell from the roof. Funny. Do you know the funniest part? The legend about the Ghost proved to be very long-lived. It was not destroyed even by his death. Soon afterwards rumors started in the criminal world that the Ghost is still alive. That he wasn't killed. Because the criminals also need their hero. Their own legend. The idea is so enticing that certain writers try to resurrect him in their novels. Listen, sir. I just... I just read about the Ghost killer once in a newspaper and invented a story. The book sold well, so I continued writing sequels... If someone does not like it, they don't need to read it. But before his death the Ghost completed the order. Knife stab in the neck. That's how mole-rats are usually killed. So what? Why am I telling you this? The Ghost's last victim was the brother of our police colonel. A major from Kemerovo. Now do you understand his reaction? Yes... Hands together. Good job. Hold the reins. Lower the heel. There. Good job. Don't sleep! With energy. A lift? Shall I give you a lift? Alright. My friends just opened a restaurant. Will you give me company? I'm tired, I don't want to. Thanks. Alright. I know that I'm an idiot, but what am I to do? Give me advice as man to man! What? What?... No, she doesn't talk to me on the phone. Can you imagine that? - Doesn't want to. - It's not funny. Vika, I know that this is not funny, but... Forgive me, please. I'm a thousand times guilty. Should I get on my knees before you? Want to walk all over me with your horse? Vika... Vika, wait. - Anton, do you need me at all? - Of course. Okay, that's it. What should I do for you? Stop drinking. - That's it! - I'm being serious. - I do not drink. - I'm serious. Me too. What else? - Go to bed no later than 4AM. - Okay, at 3:30AM I'm in bed. - What else? - Introduce me to your son finally. Okay, tomorrow... No, the day after tomorrow I introduce you. - Clementina is eating your flowers. - That's fine. - Stop! It's a "she"? - Yes, she's female. Give it here! Vika, wait. Allow me to carry your saddle. Thank you. - And kiss me. - Where? In the forehead. I'm gonna tell you this one story. Five years ago there was one man... Got in the way of many people, hid himself from all sides. Security, video surveillance, con-vehicles. Three tried doing him in before me. - And what? - Failed. I studied him for a long time. People next to him, his habits. Was looking for his weak points. - Found one? - I did. In Voronej. He had a grandmother living there. I did some chemisty in her medicine cabinet, and she was taken to the hospital. He flew to her from Moscow immediately. Like a bird to the feed. What about the grandma? What? The grandma will outlive both of us. Anton, let's go sleep. What do you think? Everything seems okay, but something is wrong. What is wrong? Your victims are always without bodyguards. Can be taken out at any moment. Why does he take so long? You see... the Ghost, he... He has to study the victim, right? And after all... it's literature. I can not give away everything on the first page. Got it. His thoughts are all confused. He's not thinking about work. Really? I don't know... I try to pass it all through myself. How do you do it? I imagine what I would think, what I would do, if... if I was in that situation. To think like him you have to try it yourself. - Listen... Let's try it. - Let's try it. No, I'm serious. In literature there exists such a technique called profound identification. It's when the writer lives out in real life the life of one of his characters. Let's do it like this. You give me an order. I go through all the stages... Then I will start to understand, at least on the physical level, what happens... I will experience the whole situation from within. Let's do it! Will you kill? No, kill... No. What are you thinking? No, I just... Let's do it this way... My goal... is to find myself one-on-one with the victim without witnesses. As if finish him off and escape. "As if" let's do it. Who is the victim? Choose anyone. Anyone? You don't pity her? I do pity. You're not thinking about the right thing, writer. This one. Let's do this one. He even has bodyguards, just what we need. I'll be right back. - Where are you going? - To follow him. Here. I wrote down the number. What is this? Traffic cops' database. Enter the number. Damn... So? So... We have the name and address. - Write it down. - Wow! - You have many gadgets like this? - I have enough. Vladimir Vyacheslavovich Ordyntsev. - Don't write down the name. - Why? What if they find the notebook? Cover your trail. Confuse them. Think of a nickname. He's a good-looking chap. The Macho. Just like in a novel. Macho, Fatso. You're a writer, think of something original. One moment... The Tartar... It's funny. - Why "the Tartar"? - Last name is Ordyntsev. The Golden Horde of Tatar-Mongol Empire. Funny. Let it be "Tartar" then. Do you yourself have a nickname? Probably something catchy, right? What do you need it for? Just curious. The Ghost. - I was being serious. - I'm also serious. Okay, if you don't want to tell me, then don't. Ready. What's next? How much? - I don't understand. - Will you work for free? You're asking about money? - Wait, maybe... - No, this is not gonna work. You wanted to go through all the stages for real. So name a price? I don't know... What are your income brackets? How much do you make from a book? - Everything depends on number of copies sold... - Trying to raise the price? - No, no, I... - Well then how much? - Thirty? - A thousand. Dollars? - If it's a bestseller, then... - Suppose that the "Tartar" is a bestseller. - Then it's thirty, yes. - Okay. I leaft you advance payment in the storage area at the train station. Code to the box is known only by you and the one who makes the order, which is me. Do not go to it right away. Look around. Study the people nearby. Catch drift of the mood. Feel that your life depends on this. - Do you know how birds are like people? - How? They fly to where the feed is. Funny. Hi. I missed you a lot. I'll call you back. From the moment you took the money you're hired. Think of it as signing a contract. What's next? Now study his personality, his daily schedule. His habits, interests. The people around him. While following the Tartar, I tried hard to find the slightest explanation for his existence. But he was a totally useless and empty subject. Who was wasting money and wasting his life. I did not need to turn off my emotions. Towards the Tatar I simply could not have any. - You walked in after them just like that? - Yes. - You're quite something! Bought two tickets to a concert, don't remember which one now. I think he won't take the bodyguards with him to the theater. - Good job. Why did you get two tickets? - For you and me. - I don't need one. Give mine to someone else. - Alright. The concert goes on for about 3 hours without intermission. The Tartar will 100% have to go smoke or use the restroom... - By the way, the bathroom is the ideal place. - You chose the wrong profession, writer. - Thanks! Listen... Tell me, when you are going for the job... Do you have to dress in a particular way? "Going for the job" - what? What job? You are going to a concert, so dress appropriately. - Where to now? - You'll see soon. Ever shot before? We used to shoot in school. Here, shoot. Is it real? It's so heavy. Let's go. Take off the safety lock. Don't spare the bullets. There were times during war, that with their hearts shot through people were able to crawl to the trenches. Give it. Pay attention. - Finished. - Do it yourself. Excellent. Hand tighter. Like that. Got it! Control shot? Broke it? Give it here. Okay, enough for today. What do I shoot with in the theater? Your finger. I am in the crowd. Which of these people are armed? Never did I think about this before. Suddenly I felt myself naked. Naked and not confident. There is only one way to conquer this lack of confidence. - Hi. - Hey! - How's the life of your animals? - Did you drink? - You are drunk. - What are you saying? Anton, look at yourself. You are drunk. I'm celebrating the birthday of uncle Kolya. That's great! Good job, keep celebrating. Drink more, write your books, I am going home. We had an agreement. I asked you like a man. Why do you make promises then? Come on, now... No, no. - Give me my coat. - Come on now. When you come to your senses we'll talk, alright? I said give me the coat! That's it! That's it... Anton, I am not joking. I'm really fed up with it to here... - Where are you going? - There. Get lost, I'm not joking. No jocking, you hear? I'm disgusted. Don't you understand? Take your hands off, I said! - What are you doing? - You just hurt me. Understand? Anton, have you gone mad? - Calm down. - What calm down? Calm down. - I understand everything. - What do you understand? - What do you understand? - Do not touch me, okay? What do not touch? What do not touch... Has something happened? Tough day. Personal problems. I see. I can't find understanding with a girl. We argue. Without her it's bad, with her it's bad. I'm all confused. This morning she left me a letter: "I'm leaving." Bla bla bla and stuff... Maybe she has someone else? - In what sense? - How'd you know? No, no... No, it can't be. If it can't, then it can't. Okay, what's next? Tomorrow is the concert. Is that it? The last stage? What else? As we agreed. You find yourself with him all alone in a place... you leave quietly without witnesses, - Later you tell me how it was. - Definitely. Good luck. Don't forget the finger. Hi, Vika, where are you? Nowhere? I see. Say, that letter... are you serious? Yes, I'm serious, I couldn't be more serious. That's it. I'm tired. Vika... Do you have someone else? I don't have anyone. Even you. Let's go, it's not nice. People are waiting. Who's that there? Who is there? It's him, right? Why are you screaming? What do you care? Hello! Let's go. Mother of... - Something happened? - No. What are you doing, jerk? What?! Stop! Come here! I will kill you, bitch! - Bye. Thank you. - Maybe you'll offer me some coffee? - After coffee people don't sleep. - I'm not planning to. I'm planning to. Forgive me. Everything was great, many thanks. I'll see you tomorrow. Pleasant dreams. Last thing I need. Who is that? With two at once, right? - Vadim, do not get out. - Wait. Anton! Get out from here! - This guy? - What do you want? Anton! - You what... - What do you want? What do you want? What do I want? Anton, look at me. Get out of here! Stop it! - What do I want? - Get out of here, you hear? Get out of here. Now, leave. I ask you, leave, Anton. Spit and that's enough... Animal... Can you get up? He fell, I beat him with the gun handle. I felt only one thing - satisfaction. He screamed, trying to hide behind his hands. I could do anything I want to him. I could do anything. Vika was also yelling something, I do not remember. I did not pay attention to her. Suddenly, I realized how I want to die. I want to die in the moment when I have this total power. Not die as a writer, no. Not as that famous old man who gives out autographs. No, I want to die in a fight. In that fight in which I am the winner. Once and that's it. That's it! I beg you only five minutes. For five minutes. We meet and I go. I have to tell you something very important. I'm really asking you. At 6PM. Alright? Where I said, okay? Yes, yes. Wait, wait, I love... Flowers will not help. - Vika, please forgive me. - You're forgiven, is that all? No. It's all the nerves, the wiskey. I give you my word of honor that from today I don't drink. - Word of honor? - Word of honor. - Shall we go? - Where? "An evening of organ music." - Anton, are you sure you're sober? - I'm sure. - What kind of music? - Organ music. - Okay, let's try it. - Come on. Wait! Put this in your purse. - What is it? - It's... a surprise. You'll open it later. Later. Only I haven't forgiven you, got it? - Hi, Pasha. - Hi. - How are you doing? - Good. - Why are you not playing with the boys? - I don't know. Let's go. Look at those cars. Good cars. Please open the purse. What is this? - A gift. - Please open. - It this necessary? - What is inside? What? What's inside? Tell me! Sorry. I'll Be back. Hold it. Notice and remember. How many bodyguards... In general pay more attention, Anton. Check the windows, remember all the exits. You must know exactly where is the smoking room, the bathroom, the buffet. Bravo! - Telephone. - What? Phone! Listen carefully, writer. The gun has your fingerprints on it. In your book you described in detail how you plan to kill this man. If you go to the cops, I'll kill Vika. See you later. Here. This is for you from your son. - What do you want? - Open the door! Open the door! Young man, where are you going? - Where's the 7th ward? - Visitation hours are over! You can't go there! I'll call security! Security! Pasha... Get up. Get ready. Let's go. - Good day. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. I found this in the garbage bin. The caliber matches. Send the gun for experts analysis. You see... All the ducks flew away. Only these two remained. She has a broken wing, and the male does not want to fly away without her. The Ghost finished off Ordyntsev, I already sent our man to him. - Are you sure it's him? - Yes. I got a photo of his face, as you requested. Sit down. Here he's taking the advance. The box number and code I gave myself. Here he is following Ordyntsev. So... Eat. This is really good for you. To be honest, I never thought that he would be so young. Vitaly... Don't miss. A wonderful dish. COMPATIBILITY 98% - Finally. - Quiet. Quiet. This is Pasha. Take him. I must run now, if I'm not back in more than 2 hours, then call police and speak to Sergei Slesarev. Sergei Slesarev, main command. - Say that I have been set up. - Who set you up? Just say that I've been set up. Don't open the door to anybody. I have to go now. - Anton. - What? - I was very scared. - About what? About you. Tell me, what's going on? Do not open to anyone. Go on now. Coming, coming. Guess whose fingerprints are on the gun? Very funny, Slesarev. - Remember that writer? - You serious? The last witness of Yagorsky case has been killed. Now think... How is Prachenko involved in the assassination next to the bookshop? Anyways. Go to him, we are coming behind you. Remember the address. Damn. Come on, birdy. Show yourself. Are you okay? I'm asking, are you okay? It's alright... So? Happy? - Have you yourself ever killed? - He wanted to meet with you. I've been studying you for a long time. The people close to you. Was looking for your weak points. We'll make a book. Like a bird to the feed. - What is your name? - The Ghost. To think like one you have to try it yourself. Who is the victim? Even with bodyguards, just what we need. So "the Ghost" is now me? Great, great how I set myself up. So the victim was a real one? What if I didn't choose the Tartar? How well you planned it. "Like a bird to the feed..." Where are we going? Where are we going? Why are you always silent? Bitch... Bitch! Carefully. Yes? Sergei Valentinovich Slesarev? Yes, Captain Slesarev is listening. Anton asked me to call you. Anton Prachenko. He said that I must call you, if he is not back in two hours. He also said that he thinks he's been set up... What? My address? Goncharova 32, apartment 10. Okay, I'm waiting. Good morning. The chain extends only as far as the toilet. My head hurts. Suck it up, it'll stop soon. Why did they think that you're dead? Mistook me for another. Here are pills for the headache. Yes... If you decide to play games with me, you'll be working together with Vika and your son. I'll put their heads right here. They'll be giving you advice. Please, don't touch them. You have two days. Wait, wait. You... - Why do you need this? - It's interesting. Every move, every action, even the most well thought out, may be wrong. No matter how much it may be better than just standing in one place. It is my decision and only I must answer for it. You can do it, when you want to. Done eating? Listen. If you let me go, I'll disappear. Nobody will ever know anything, I will never tell anybody anything. I swear to you. Why should you live? After all, I have a son... I have Vika. And why would they need you? Is it better to live like you, all alone? People are always alone. And most of all they hate those, who are close to them. Sorry. Here they are, your people. "Boys stab their friend to death over a bicycle." Here's another good one. "A college student throws her newborn baby down a garbage shaft." How do you like this one? "A father rapes his daughter for many years, the mother knew, but said nothing." You better tell us how it's possible to put your own son into an insane asylum? Shut your mouth. Why don't you write about that? You've experienced it on the inside. I... I used to drink a lot. Before... Pasha was born... with severe problems. Wife immediately left, and I... I took him home... I thought I could manage with him. It was then I was finishing the first book. He... He must have been in a lot of pain... He screamed all the time... And I can not have someone else there, when I... All these pills, all these drugs... nothing was helping. I love him, but I... I had to write. At the boarding school... there are at least doctors there. It was better for him there... I just decided that it will be better for him there... It is better for you. You do not love anyone, writer. Everyone is like that. You... Don't judge everyone according to yourself. I do not judge according to myself. I am no judge. Who are you? You think it up. You're a writer after all. Are you a moral monster. That is what you are. Yeah, put me into an insane asylum, as you had done with your son. There's a storyline for you. Wash up. What's stinking so? A dead body. I'm waiting for the ending. Not funny. You can not leave anyone behind. Or they will find you. Sooner or later they'll find you. If you do not destroy yourself, you will surely be destroyed by someone else. No other options. Not too much salt? Try it. Samuel Colt once said that it's not the weapon that kills, but the man. I'm ready to sign my name under every single word of that quote. The End. This is it. Sign here. As a ghost he lived, as a ghost he died. Here. So you were just writing a book? Oh, God... Who brought me here? Nothing else worries you? Because of your scribblings people have died. I did not want that. "Did not want..." To be honest, I also did not want the criminal charges against you to be dropped. But from a conspirator you turned into a hostage. Alright, anyways...
