Remember what l said to you at the beginning, Molly. You weren't just a witness to a violent assault. You were a victim as much as your father was. Now l'm going to suggest something to you. [siren wailing] [voice fades to the background] lt might help if you were to go back to the house. l could go with you if you like. - No. - No. - No, sorry. - All right. - Anyway, it's just been sold, so time to move on. - Sure. You'll still be staying with Frank and Jess? - They've been fantastic, but l can't expect them to put up with me indefinitely. - l think they love having you around. And if it offers a safe haven for now... - l want a home of my own. l've started looking. - Right. - Outside Dublin. l like the idea. lt's much cheaper, more peaceful. [car alarm blaring] - Go back to bed. No, no, go back, go back. [distorted voices] - Fuck you. Fuck off! [knocking at door] - Molly, Molly? - Come in. - Sleepy head. l was getting worried. Oh. Nightmare? Your Dad? You poor baby. Do you want to cancel this thing? - l'm fine. - l wouldn't worry about offending an estate agent. - No, really. [engines humming] - Remind me again why you want to get out of Dublin. [laughter] [horns honking] [building orchestral music] - Listen. That's what most people are paying for: tranquility, and the space outside as well as the space inside. Oh, and light. l mean, the house is full of natural light. French doors, south facing. The patio is perfect for sunning yourself all afternoon. Kitchen, oak Shaker, electric hub, oven, fridge, freezer, granite worktops: all is standard. Utility room, and upstairs. This is a feature most people like is the high ceilings. l think you'll be pleasantly surprised by the roominess of the bedrooms. Now, family bathroom, and into the master bedroom. [birds chirping] - Molly. Molly. l think our friend might feel he's wasting his sweetness. - Sorry. - As you can see, a lovely view of Mount Leinster That will my 1 2:00. So what do you think? - Um, it's lovely. l'll certainly think seriously about it. - Well, as l said, this is the last one, so l wouldn't think too long if l were you. Any last questions? - The fitted kitchen, did you say that was extra? - No, that's standard, or you can choose your own, and we'll add 5,000. Oh, we can also install a superb alarm system for an extra grand. - No, thanks. No alarms. - Fully guaranteed for five years, including maintenance. - No. - What, are you expecting a crime wave in the village? - Hardly. People like their peace of mind. Anyway, there you have it. As l said, it's the last one. Just imagine what this would cost you up in Dublin. Anyway, l'd better go. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Bye-bye. - And on to his new best friend. l hope you got the message, Molly. You need him more than he needs you. - Arrogant little twerp. l think he was expecting you to whip out the checkbook there and then. - That's the way it is, l suppose. [engine turning over] - l mean, if you don't mind living in the back and beyond, the house itself isn't bad. - lt seemed very peaceful. And people really commute to Dublin from there? - Didn't you notice? Not a soul to be seen. - What sort of life is that? - l won't have to commute. l can work from home, pop down to the village for whatever l need. - What, baked croissants at the Boulangerie? Espresso? A pot of tea and a scone would be the height of it. - What do you think, Jess? - Well, you know we love having you here. ls it not all a bit too soon? Maybe you should talk the whole thing through with Luke Masterson. - Well, l think l'm ready for a break from therapy. l told Luke. - You didn't say. - Anyway, isn't it vital to get your toe on the old property ladder these days? - Mm. - You know what l mean, though. A home of my own. - Of course. But you've been through so much. l wouldn't do anything rash. [cars humming and revving] [horn honks] [people chatting] - There's two for the front and two for the back here. - Yeah, it seems a lot now, but that's the way property is going. - 200,000, 250,000- more than that. - 'Cause they know if they wait it will cost them twice as much. [people chatting] Okay? Yeah, bye-bye. Hello again. - l've decided to go for it, Meadowlands. - Sorry, we closed that sale this morning. - What? - Afraid so. - Was it that man yesterday? - Well, look, we've got something similar near completion a bit further out. lt'll be dear, of course, when it's ready for sale, but- have you a brochure there, hon? Yep, thanks. Okay. - [sobbing] - Would you get us two coffees, please, Pat? - l'm sorry. l'm such a baby. - No, no. No, no, no. You're fine, fine. - lt's just, the more l thought about it last night, the more excited l got. - l can imagine. - And it's definitely sold? l mean, people ever change their mind? - Rarely, no. They're all trying to chase their dream, you know. Get away from all that. Look, the check for the down payment hasn't arrived in yet, so technically, maybe- - Yeah? - Well, l mean, it's a new house, so obviously we can't get into a bidding war. l mean, the price is the price. But let's just say to close the sale, you were prepared to offer another 5k. - God, yeah, but l thought you said the price was the price. - Of course. No, this would be a local arrangement, you know? l mean, l'm only saying this 'cause l can tell how much the house means to you, you know. lt would be up to yourself. - There's a word for it, Molly. You know that. lt's gazumping. l mean, it goes on all the time, obviously. - You think l shouldn't. - My poor love. You've been through so much. l just don't want you to do anything you'll regret in the long run. Here. Sleep on it. [lock clicks] - [whistles] l'm carrying the lot, am l? - Sorry. [laughter] Thank you. [car zooms by] [faint barking] [electronic beeping] [birds calling] - [giggling] [horn honking] [bright rock music] - Hello! - Great to see you. - [squealing] l'm good. How are you? - Lovely to see you. - Hello, Sarah! How are you? - How are you? - Good. - Hello. - Hello. - You look fantastic. - Thank you, thanks. Thank you. Go on ahead to the left. There's lots of drinks. - l hope you don't mind. l bumped into this gorgeous man the other night. - Of course not. Hi. - Hey, how you doing? - l hadn't seen him in ages. He's been away for how long? - More or less since college, l think. - Hi! [all chattering] - Thanks for having us. - Great. Yeah, into the left. - Guess who? - You wouldn't remember me. - Oh, she will. Molly had the most enormous crush on you in school. - Sarah! - But you did. - lt's fantastic. lt's absolutely gorgeous. - Thank you. - So how far away from Dublin are we? - Not far at all. [bright rock music] - [mouthing silently] [snoring quietly] [snoring quietly] [dishes clink] [water running] - Need a hand? - Sorry, l was in a world of my own. - Hope it's not as painful as mine. - There's some stuff up there. - Oh, cheers. - Um, they're no use to you. Here, try this. - Glad l was first up. - So am l. Glad l had one left for you. - Thanks. Great house. Congratulations. - Thank you. [all talking at once] - But listen. You've got to get a car now. Mal, tell her to get a car. - Get a car, will you? Listen, thanks, Molly. - Okay. See you soon. - Look after yourself, okay? - l'll see you, darling. - See you. See you soon. Thanks for coming. Bye. - lf you need any help decorating, no charge. A house warming present. - Okay, thanks. l just might. - Mal. - All right. [engine revving] - We'll see you soon. Thanks again for having us. Thanks for coming. - Thanks a lot. - Bye. - Thanks so much. - Bye! - Bye, Molly. - Bye. [somber orchestral music] [machinery whirring] - Well, what's going on in those new houses? - How do you mean? - Well, you're the first person from up there to put a bit of business my way. That's all. - Oh, well, there's never anyone around. They go to work before dawn and don't get home till after dark. - Mad, isn't it? [laughter] Well, if you are talking to any of them, let them know l can supply them with everything they need on the DlY front, huh? - Mm-hmm. - There you go. That what you had in mind? - Perfect. - Oi, Francie. l'm Joe, by the way. You're welcome to the area. - Thanks. Molly. - Come on, Francie. [phone chiming] - [frustrated sigh] No. [phone beeping] [faint barking] l wasn't sure if you got my message. - l was in the area. - What? - No, but your message sounded a bit panicky. - Did it? l'm a bit embarrassed now. lt's no big deal. - What's up? - Well, you see, l do research work for this arts program. l read books and prepare briefs for the presenter. - Oh, all right, so he can sound like he's read everything. - Yeah, anyway, all of a sudden, they have to have the stuff by tomorrow, and l was in the middle of all this. - You want me to finish it? No problem. - Sorry if l made it sound like a crisis. - No, no, it's fine. l'll start straight away. Hello? - Hi. - Guess what time it is? - Oh, my God. - Can you spare a minute? - Of course. - Cool. - [gasps] Oh, thank you! - Yeah, it's not bad. You happy? - Yeah. - Good. l'll come back tomorrow and make a start in the hall. - Really, do you mind? - No, of course not. - That would be so fantastic. But listen, that's it for the favors now. From now on, you have to let me pay you. - We'll talk about it tomorrow. l'd better be off. Right. Sweet dreams. [engine turns over] [electronic beeping and clicking] lt's looking nice. Good buy. - Yeah, l think so. - You should see the kip of a flat l'm renting in Dublin. Jesus. - What brought you back to lreland? - Well, l know how this sounds, but l missed the lrish girls. - [laughs] - No, seriously, 'cause l started to do the rounds while l was away. - Oh, how do you mean? - Oh, let's see. There was a Japanese girl, Kiki. Two Spanish girls, not at the same time, obviously. - Oh, obviously. - Manuela, and... oh, Christ, what was her name? Oh, God. - Oh, moving right along. - Okay, a very serious Swiss girl, Natalie. - Oh, yeah? - A few Scandinavians. - Okay, okay, enough. So now you're looking for a sweet flame-haired collie? - Yeah, yeah, something like that. - And does Sarah fit the bill? - Sarah? No, no, not at all. Did you think- No, no, no, no. We're just pals. l don't think l'm Sarah's type at all. - Ah, Molly, how are you? - Hiya. - Oh, well, this is you. Francie is looking after you? - He is, yeah. - Great. How's the decorating going? - Oh, couldn't be better. [machinery whirring, slowing] [packages clatter] [glass tinkling] [gasps] - And nothing taken? Money, jewelry? - No. - Fecking vandals. Maybe you disturbed them and they legged it out the back. Did you ever think of getting an alarm? - Didn't think l'd need one out here. - Fair enough, l suppose. Normally. [car approaches, stops] Anyone you know? - Yeah, it's a friend of mine. - Hey, are you okay? - Yes. - Oh, Jesus. - Right. l'll be in touch if we find out anything, but, well, you know yourself. - Okay, thanks anyway. - Good luck. - [sighs] We'll have to fix that for a start. Hey, it's okay. We're gonna clear it all up. Come here. My poor baby. l'm gonna make everything all right. [both gasping and moaning] [both grunting] - [shouting] [both sighing and laughing] Oh, well, Jesus. Burglary is a turn-on, huh? [laughter] Are you okay now? - l'm just glad you're here, Mal. - Hey. - When l saw the door hanging open... - Shh. - lt reminded me. - What? - My Dad. A year ago, l was still living at home, just him and me, you know. - Yeah? - One night l woke up 'cause l heard shouting. Looked out the window. There were these guys totally out of it, pissing in the front garden. l knew they'd woken Dad up too. - Go. Go back to bed. - l just new there was going to be trouble. - Go back to bed. Hey, you two! What do you think you're doing there? [shouting] He tried to keep them out, but he hadn't a hope. When l tried to stop them, one of them came at me, screaming into my face. - Want some of that, do you? - Jesus. - Dad! By the time l got to Dad, his heart had... [sobbing] [distant footsteps, rattling] Mal? - Hey. Sorry l woke you, but l figured it was safer to fix this. - Thanks. - That's okay. - Mal? - Yeah? - Will you stay the night? - Do l look like l'm going anywhere? [chuckles] - Well, now look who's back to see us again. How's it going? - lt's not great. l was burgled yesterday. - Oh, no. - While l was here. - l'm sorry to hear it. The fecking whores. Did the alarm not scare them off? - l don't have one. - l thought those houses had them fitted. - lt was extra. l didn't go for it. - Right, well, now listen. My brother Mossie does a great job on the alarm front. He'd sort you out, no bother. - No thanks, Joe. - Okay. Thanks. - There you go. - Thanks, Francie. [alarm bell ringing] [horn honking] - Molly, turn away for a second. We have a little surprise for you. - Okay. both: Okay, you can turn round now. - Ta-da! We thought you might need a little help getting round out here in the sticks. - Oh, guys, thank you so much. - You remember how? - Well, l'll give it a go. Okay. [chuckling] [cheers and applause] both: On a bicycle made for two - Oh, my God. [bell dings] - Molly, why didn't you tell us? - We'd have come down straight away. - You poor thing. And you're hardly in the door. - lt wasn't too bad. They didn't even take anything. - Yeah, but it's what it does to your head. - You didn't sleep last night, did you? - Not much. - Was the place in an awful state? - Yeah, but Mal helped clean up. - Who's Mal? - He's just a guy l knew in school. He's been helping me with the painting. - Oh, that's why it's such a good job. - Frank, shut up. Get that restaurant guide, would you? lt's in the car. He's such an idiot. So go on. This Mal was here. - He just happened to be coming to do more painting. - l'm only asking. Weren't you lucky he was around? l hope he stayed the night to protect you. ls he nice? - Yeah, kind of gorgeous. - Well, listen. Frank discovered there's a very highly rated restaurant just a few miles from here. We were going to treat you this evening anyway, so why don't you invite this... - Mal. - Mal, invite him too. We can book for four as easy as three. Ah, go on. l'm dying to meet him. - Dying to meet who? What? Well, so far it's that he's a good decorator. - Okay, he's texted back. - And? - ''Working late.'' - Oh, pity. - ''Go ahead, meet you there.'' - Excellent. Well, l hope it lives up to the review. - lt looks classy enough in the brochure. - Oh, it does get very cold up here. - Well, you're up in the mountains. And it is December. - l know that, but the wind is never as cold as this in Dublin, is it? ''Herb crusted rack of lamb with a parsnip mash.'' Hmm. - Who would have thought it, eh? l would have thought a Chinese takeaway would be the only cuisine you'd find around here. Well, if this is as good as it sounds, we'll be bunking in with you every weekend. You'll never get rid of us. - Let's order. Mal won't mind. thump! [mouthing silently] - Oh, is that him? - Very easy on the eyes. - You behave yourself. Hi. - Hey. - This is Mal. Mal, Jessica. - Jess, please. Nice to meet you. - And Frank. - How you doing, Frank? - Getting ready for the once-over? - Frank! - l've just been telling them how you're helping me with the decorating. - That's the official version, anyway. - Which is fine by me. Thanks for the invitation. You know, this reminds me of a little country place l worked in when l was in ltaly. - Really, you can cook? - l wouldn't poison you. - Well, now, sounds like you're very handy to have around the house. - [chuckles] - Thanks for coming tonight. - l enjoyed it. They seem really nice. - They've been so kind to me. - So what are they, like godparents? - No, that's the strange thing. They were just old friends of Dad's. He and Jess lectured in the same department. l hardly knew them until after Dad... you know. They helped out so much with all the funeral stuff. Don't know what l would have done. Then they invited me to stay with them. Suppose they realized... l mean, they did it for Dad's sake, but it was like they really love me, you know? - And they've no kids? - No, they seem to like it that way. - You think? - Yeah, why? - Oh, l got the feeling they were happy to have you around. - You mean like the child they never had? - Yeah, that sort of thing. l bet they didn't want you to leave. - You're right. But, you know, it was time. - Jesus! Molly, hold on! Molly. - My bike. They've taken my bike. - Hey, hey, it's all right. Calm down. lt's all right. You're safe. lt's okay. lt's all right. [pounding] - And apart from the bicycle, there was nothing else taken? - None of the rest touched. - So was it someone else this time? lt's strange, huh? Right, well, sure. l'll ask around. Maybe one of the neighbors saw something. You really should think about an alarm, you know. [tapping] Good luck. - Yeah. Fucking brain-dead cops. Mind you, he's probably right about the alarm. - l know. - Listen, Molly, l've been thinking. l mean, l don't think you should be on your own right now, you know. - Mal, you can't believe what it means to me to have you here. - l want to be here with you. - Will you stay? Please? - For as long as you want. Hey, l'm getting pretty horny. - Not now. Sorry. - Sure. l know, l know. [clatter] - [sighs] [clears throat] [phone beeping] - Hey, this is Sarah's phone. You know what to do next. beep! - Hello, Sarah, it's Molly. l was just ringing for a chat. Nothing special. Give us a ring if you can. l'm at home all day. [doorbell rings] [phone beeps] Joe, how are you? - l knew you'd say that. l told him you'd say that. l'm not Joe. Joe sent me. - Sorry? - l'm his brother Mossie. - Oh, you're twins. - For our sins, yeah. Now, you see that? That's the give-away. Joe would never do anything like that. Far too straight-laced, you know what l mean? Anyway, he tells me you've had a spot of bother. You want an alarm put in. - Two burglaries. - How did they break in? - Front door. - Oh, cheeky feckers. You haven't had a wink of sleep, have you? Mind if l survey the scene? Yeah, l was a bit put out about them sending down a Dublin crowd to put the alarm systems in. Oh, not good for the local economy, you know what l mean? Anyway, l'll do you a good job. No problem there. Any special requirements? - l don't know, really. - Okay, you got bay windows, French windows, guard the door. Okay, obviously we cover all the access points. We'll give you a nighttime setting so you can still move about upstairs, do your business. What about panic buttons? Great for the peace of mind. Bedroom. [muttering] Do you mind if l? - No. - Okay, so panic button. That suit you? - Whatever you think. - Fair enough. Now, l can squeeze you in this afternoon. But if you want to think about it, it will take three weeks. - Oh, this afternoon please. - Knew you'd say that. Do you want to talk cash, or will l wait for himself? - There's no himself, so you can talk to me. - Fair enough. Let's see now. Ten access points, panic button, master control box. Say a thousand. - Sure. - Honest to God, you young ones, throwing your money away. All right, 800, my final offer. - What? - Okay, so for you, 750. All right? All right. - Yep, great. - So l'll see you this afternoon. And don't worry. You'll sleep tonight. [phone beeping] You sure he'll get back to you fast? - lf not, we'll think of something else. - Okay, now, when you're leaving the house, just key in the code. When you're going to bed, key in zero, seven. lf the alarm does goes off, the video screen here will show you the source of the intrusion. [phone chiming] - Okay, l've got it, my birthday and his. - No, no. Don't tell me. No one else should know. Just key it in and verify. [electronic beeping] - [computerized voice] System is armed to home. - Okay. - Right, let's give it a bit of a test. So here is the scenario. lt's daytime, the alarm isn't even set. Suddenly you hear a sound: breaking glass, the door being forced open. Or you haven't even locked the door. Now you hear someone moving around inside the house. Panic button. [alarm trilling] There you go. Okay, disarm the system. [alarm trilling] [electronic beeping] [alarm stops] - [computerized voice] System is disarmed. - That's it. Simple as that. One last thing. Come on up. Very important. You can't use the panic button again until you reset it. The key. And ready to go. [engine humming] [electronic beeping] - [computerized voice] System is armed to home. [beeping] - [laughing] [beeping intensifies] - Well, now, who's this handsome intruder? - l saw the box outside. That was quick. - Come here. You'll have to help me with the code. l'll do the first two numbers, but l can't remember the last two. - Molly, it's going to go off. - Two special little numbers. What were they? lt was one, two- - What are you doing? Turn it off. - One, two, and- - l don't know any special numbers! [alarm trilling] l got it. l got it. l got it. [beeping] [alarm stops] - [computerized voice] System is disarmed. - So your birthday is the 1 2th, huh? - Mm-hmm. - That's very romantic. - You think? - Yeah, l do. Hey, we'd better let people know it was a false alarm, yeah? No one's interested. What are they like around here? So you feeling safe tonight? - Mm-hmm. - Feeling safe now? - Yeah. - Are you sure? - Definitely. - Completely safe? - Totally. - We'll see about that. - [gasps] - Scared? - No. - You sure? - Yeah. Yeah, l'm sure. [gasps] - Hello, Joe. lt is Joe, isn't it? - Oh, you met Mossie then, huh? [laughs] Did he do a good job? - Perfect. - And he gave you a good price? - Absolutely. - Excellent, and how are things on the sleep front? - Oh, look at me, fresh as a daisy. - Well, l'm delighted for you. What can l get you now? - Just some teak oil. Francie! [distant clattering] l'll get it. Eh, no, l knew Mossie wouldn't let you down. Bit of a showoff, you know. But the work is sound. Us guys, actually, we don't hang around much, so people are always saying, how come they never see the two of us at the same time. l think they wonder if it's only one of us pretending to be two people. [laughs] - This is the guy who sold me the house. - Huh? Oh, yeah. Well, to tell you the truth, now, he wouldn't be very popular around here, him or his company. Not that l think he deserved the beating or anything. But you know yourself, estate agents, they're kind of hard to feel sorry for, aren't they? Bastards. Anyway, there you are. No, no, go on. lt's on the house. lt'll be my good deed for the day, all right? - Thanks. - Cheers. [phone beeping and trilling] - Property Now. Good morning. - Hello, l'm one of your clients. l recently bought in Meadowlands. Just been reading about what happened to lan Laurie, l'm very shocked. - Yes, it was awful. - Well, is there anywhere l can call him and pass on my good wishes, or even visit him in hospital? - l'm afraid he's gone abroad for an extended break. As you can imagine, it was very traumatic. But l'll certainly pass on your good wishes. - Okay, if you would. Thanks. - Good-bye. [doorbell rings] click! - Taking the air? - Yeah, just a little break from work. - So how about a longer break, a nice lunch? - Oh, no, l can't, folks. - 'Course you can. Our treat. - No, really, l've got a deadline, and l'm right up against it. Sorry you came all the way. Listen, come in for a coffee anyway. - No, no. We don't want to hold you up. - You're fine. l'll throw you out if you're staying too long. - Fair enough. l see you gave in. - Thought l'd better. - Oh, good. And how is it? Do you feel any safer? - l suppose. [alarm beeping] - lt's very neat, isn't it? You can hardly even notice it. And how long now do you have to turn it off? - 30 seconds. Jess, would you please get the door? - Frank. Door. [alarm trilling] One, two, two, four. - [computerized voice] System is disarmed. - l swear, l'd be useless. l can never remember codes. Frank has all these tricks for remembering. - l'll organize the coffee. - One, two, two, four. Frank, one, two, two, four. How would you remember that? - One, two, two, four. Well, that's easy. Simple sequence. Double one, two. Double two, four. Or if you prefer, double 1 2, 24. - What kind of brain have you? l wouldn't say Molly was thinking of number sequences when she chose those numbers. Were you, pet? - So what was she thinking of? - Let's see. One, two, two, four, or as you said, 1 2 and 24. So 1 2 could be the 1 2th of something. Well? - Oh, l haven't a clue. - Oh, Frank, when is Molly's birthday? - The 1 2th of- ah, right. So the 24 must be... doesn't ring any bells. - l'd say 24 could be another significant birthday. - Yes, but how would we know that? - Okay, coffee's nearly ready. - That new friend of yours, Mal. - Yeah? - When is his birthday, l wonder? lt's not the 24th, is it? - Ah, very good guess. [laughter] Very good. [car doors slam] [front door clicks] - Spooky. - Mal, see that car over there, the one like a Jeep? That's been parked there all day. - Yeah? - l called over, but nobody answered. - Maybe they just left the car behind. - No, there's a light on there now, but no one has come back to the house. - Molly, have you been watching the whole time? - The estate agent who sold me the house, lan, he's been beaten up. - Sorry? - lt was in the paper. He was assaulted. And the day l viewed the house, his next client drove something just like that. - Molly, half the country is riding around in 4x4s. l'm not following the logic here. - l don't know either. lt's just-is there some connection with the break-ins? - What? How? - Well, l don't know, but l've been here over a month now, and l haven't met a single other person who lives around. l don't know who my neighbors are. - That's the way these places are. People are busy. - Well, let's just call now. Let's just go and knock on the door. - Over there? - Yeah, say hello. - Molly, no, no, no. Bad idea. - Okay, let's go next door. That's the normal thing to do, isn't it? - What's the point? - Meet our neighbors. ''Hello, how are you?'' - Well, you go if you want, but l mean, l'm... [doorbell rings] - Yes? - Sorry to disturb you. l'm from next door. - Oh, right. - l know this is out of the blue, but l just thought, as we're neighbors, we should introduce ourselves. l'm Molly, by the way. - Oh, hello. - No one ever seems to be around during the day, so anyway, just on a whim, really, l called round now. - Right, well, thanks. - Who is it, darling? - lt's okay, Jen. Listen, sorry, we have a few friends here from Dublin, and we're just about to sit down to eat. - Oh, bad time. l'm really sorry. - No, no, it's okay. We'll hook up soon. l'll-we'll give you a call, okay? - That was stupid, wasn't it? - lmpulsive. Coffee? - What's the matter with me today? Earlier on Frank and Jess called out of the blue to bring me to lunch, and l was really annoyed. l nearly said, ''Why didn't you phone first?'' - That's all right. - Then Jess was looking over my shoulder when l was trying to turn off the alarm and l felt tense, you know, like l didn't want her to see the code, like it matters, for God's sake. Then she and Frank started trying to work out why l chose that particular code, going on and on, saying it over and over. ''One, two, two, four. 1 2, 24, 1 2, 24,'' till l just wanted to scream at them, ''Shut up, shut up!'' Mad. - Do you need to take anything? - No, like what? - l don't know. You okay? - Yeah, l'll be fine. [alarm trilling] - Stay right here. l'll go down. - Mal, please! [alarm continues] - [computerized voice] System is disarmed. - Mal? - lt's okay. - What do you mean? - l mean it's okay. There's nothing. - Are you sure? - l'm checking everywhere. Hold on. Yeah, yeah, you know, it's all secure. lt must be gremlins. Nobody's trying to break in. - Maybe l should have a look. - Molly, it's fine. We'll get him to check the alarm tomorrow. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Go down yourself if it makes you feel any better. - No, no. l believe you. Sorry l'm so jittery. - You're jittery? l was the one that had to go down there. Jesus, it's nearly 4:00. [toilet flushes] - Did you set it again? - Let me see. l think so. l can't remember really. - Mal, please. - l did, l did. l swear, relax. You okay? - Yeah, l'll be fine. lt's just- - l know. But remember, it was a false alarm, yeah? Yeah? - Yeah. - All right. - How are you? - Fine. Thanks for getting Mossie. - Yeah, he was all apologies. l think he was a bit disappointed you weren't up to see him. Did you check it? - Yeah, been in and out all day. Seems fine. - Meet any more of your lovely neighbors? - Aha, l've come up with a nice way to meet them. ''Dear neighbors, you're invited to Christmas drinks and nibbles ''Friday the 1 8th of December from 6:00 p.m., casual. ''Looking forward to meeting you and toasting the holiday, Molly and Mal.'' - ''Toasting the holiday.'' That's a bit American, isn't it? - Yeah, l know. Anyway, is that okay? - Yeah, if you like. Molly, you're not thinking of delivering them tonight, are you? - Yeah, why? - Well, if you're wandering around in the dark putting envelopes in their doors, they might think it's a bit bonkers, you know? Wouldn't tomorrow do? - Yeah, fair point. - All right. [muffled clattering] Mal? Mal! - Hi, l couldn't sleep. Can l get you anything? - No, thanks, though. - Night. Hey, Molly. - Yeah? Have you kind of woken up now? - Yeah, l suppose so. - Maybe l'll come back to bed then. - Okay, if you like. - All right. l'll see you in a sec. Oh tidings of comfort and joy, do-do, do, do [humming] l've been thinking about Jess and Frank and the party. - Have you invited them? - That's the thing. l feel a bit guilty, 'cause l sort of don't want to. - That's fine. Don't. - You think? - Of course. They don't have to be around every time something is happening in your life. - Yeah, l know. - So it's fine. l wouldn't worry about it. - l did call Sarah, though, to invite her. - Oh, yeah? ls she coming? - l left a message. No answer yet. l'm a bit bothered. She hasn't phoned in ages, not since we got together. - She's probably jealous. - You think? - lt could be. - But you told me there was nothing between you and Sarah. - There wasn't. Doesn't mean she's not jealous. [people singing We Wish You A Merry Christmas] Oh, come on, Molly. Sit down. Try and relax a little bit. Just- [people singing] Molly. Come on, Molly, don't do anything silly, all right? - l'm just looking out my front door. That's okay, isn't it? [people chatting] Fuckers, horrible fuckers. l can't believe it. l can't believe no one turned up. - Hey, hey, hey. Don't worry about it, all right? Do we know or care about these people? That's right. There's only one person l want to be with tonight. And can l be honest with you? l'm glad l don't have to waste my breath making small talk with strangers. Come here. l love you, Molly. Only you. - Mal. That makes up for everything. More than. - Oh, for goodness sake, Molly, you shouldn't have. You shouldn't have. - lt's nothing. lt's a token. And give this to Mossie. - l might. l hope you didn't get him a better prezzie than me, huh? - And thank him for coming back so quickly to fix the system. Tell him it's been fine since. - Oh, he didn't get it right the first time? Well, l'll give him a right slagging over that. Snappy Christmas gifts. Ah, now. l've got something for you. - There you are. - Why are you back so early? - Don't move. - [giggles] Oh, come on. What? - Shh. Listen. [joyful orchestral music] You like? - lt's great. What is it? - lt's your Christmas present. - Oh, my God, Mal. - You like it? - Yeah. - lt's cool, isn't it? Check this out. [music grows louder] The kitchen. [joyful orchestral music] The master bedroom. Everywhere. - [laughing] lt's fantastic. [alarm trilling] - No, no, it's cool. Stay there, don't move. Don't move. [alarm continues] Who the fuck are you? Get out! Get the fuck out of here! Get your hands off me! Let go of me! slam! - Mal! - Get your hands off me! [glass shattering] - Mal, are you all right? Mal, are you okay? - Yeah, l'm fine. Just see if you can spot him. - [computerized voice] System is disarmed. - You were attacked. - He fucking hit me when l grabbed him. l didn't- - Christmas Day. Oh, Jesus, Christmas Day. - Shh. - l just can't take it anymore. l can't stand it anymore! - Sweetheart, no. - l don't know what's going on! - Are you it? l mean, is there no other cop around here? - Well, Christmas Day- - 'Cause you're useless. - And l'm kind of looking after the case. - Three burglaries in a month, my friend, and you've gotten nowhere. l mean, look at us, for Christ's sake. lt's Christmas Day. - This is a very unusual- - Oh, well there's a word for it, huh? Unusual. People playing mind games, fucking with our heads. That's definitely unusual. - At least we now know it was a lone male. - Well, that's a breakthrough. l mean, who did you think it was, a team of gnomes? - ls there any more you can tell me? - What else do you want me to tell you? lt was dark. - l understand. All you're sure of is it was a man, seems like he was about your height and size. You didn't see his face. - l've told you. l go for him. He whacks me with that, and then he dives through the window. Now do your job. - Look, l'll be honest with you. lt's obvious this isn't just a series of ordinary burglaries. Yours is the only house that's been broken into. Seems to me there has to be some personal thing going on. And, l mean, well, you're the only ones who can give me a steer on that. Right, that will have to do. - You begin to wonder, is there any point? - Yeah. - Do you need to take anything to help you sleep? - Do you think l should? - You look so tired, but l know you'll lie awake for hours tonight. - l'll be okay. [electronic beeping] - [computerized voice] System is armed to home. - [snoring softly] [electronic beeping] - [computerized voice] System is disarmed. - Don't let me go mad. Please? - [snoring softly] - Everything okay? - Yeah, sorry l woke you. - Want to make love? - No. - Massage? - No, thanks. l'll sleep now. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - [groaning] Oh, God. [groaning] Did you get any sleep? - Some. - Molly, do you think maybe you should think about selling up? - Yeah, maybe. - lt's a crap time of year to flog a house though, isn't it? - You mean, nothing will happen until the New Year. - That's right. - Do you really think l'm mad to be suspicious of the people across the road? - l'm beginning to think anything is possible. [wet splashing] - Mal, you were away a long time. l mean, did anything ever happen to you that might be the reason why- - You mean, did some sinister foreigner track me down here looking for revenge? - Don't joke, please. - Sorry. - l don't know anything about your past, do l? - Look, believe it or not, there's nothing. l mean, you don't want me to have a dark past, do you? Right, l'll hunt around the village, see if l can find someone to repair the window. Fat chance, l suppose, but it's something to do. Will you be all right on your own for a while? Why don't you go for a walk? Get some air or something. - l will. [electronic beeping] - [computerized voice] System is armed. [alarm beeping] - Morning. - Morning. - Merry Christmas. [engine turns over] [speaking indistinctly] - [gasps] [door clicks] - Hello? - Jesus Christ. Get away from me! Who are you? What are you doing here? - l just fixed the window. - What? - Your husband, he told me this was emergency. - My husband? - This will be [foreign word] Christmas to you. - The alarm, how did you turn it off? - He left me the piece of paper. The pin to your alarm is here, the numbers to your alarm. Just relax, please. Everything be all right. l just fix the window. Relax, just- everything be all right. Let me explain. - Get out of my house. - Don't be angry at me. l fix the window. - Get out of my house. Get out of my house! [voices overlapping] Get out of my house! [tires screeching] [alarm beeping] [electronic beeping] [alarm trilling] - Stupid fuck. [alarm trilling] - Molly, you're here. - l changed the code. - You what? - You gave a stranger the code! - l'm sorry. Could you knock it off? - How could you do that to me? - Please turn if off? l didn't mean- - Move away. Molly. - Move away. - Okay, okay, l'm moving away. [alarm continues] [electronic beeping] - [computerized voice] System is disarmed. - [sobbing] - l'm sorry. All l thought about was getting the window fixed. - l nearly died. l freaked. - l am so, so sorry. Please forgive me, Molly. - l'm going out of my mind, Mal. - No, no, no, you're not. No, you're not going out of your mind. Everything is all right, okay? lt's completely my fault. l wasn't thinking. l should have said something. l just- Listen, listen. There's another reason why l was out for so long. l got you something, something that might help. lt's out in the van. Do you want to have a look? Yeah? All right. Come on and have a look. - A dog? - A watchdog. l bumped into Mossie, and he told me about him. He said his owner died recently, and the poor little fellow might have to be put down. - Aw, what's his name? - Mossie said his name is Scruffy. - Hello, Scruffy. - He's lovely, isn't he? Come on, we'll go inside. Good boy. See, alarms are machines. They're consistent, you know, predictable. And thieves know you can never be sure with a dog. lsn't that right? Oh, yes. All right. l'm going to break in. - Maybe he's gone mad too, is he? So you're going to solve all our problems? Keep our enemy away? Let me sleep again? [growling and barking] Good boy, good boy. Quiet, quiet now, shh! Good dog. Shh, shh, shh. - Yes, who's a good boy, huh? Sounds good to me. - l'd definitely think twice before l'd take him on. - So should we keep him? Remember, the dog isn't just for Christmas. - Look at that face. How can we turn him down? Come on. - Have you a license for that fella? - Oh, hello. Bit of extra protection. What do you think? - Can't do any harm. - [barking] - Scruffy, sit. - lt's the uniform. Affects people that way too sometimes. - Listen, Mal was a bit wound up the other night. - Oh, sure, letting off steam. - You know, you were asking if someone was- if this is personal. - Yeah. - Well, l was thinking about that estate agent who was assaulted recently. - Yeah. - He sold me the house. - All right. - This seems very stupid, but the day l viewed the house, this guy came after me. l didn't really see him, but he drove one of those Jeeps. When l decided to buy the house, the estate agent had already accepted an offer from this guy, but he said that if l offered more that l could have it. - You gazumped him. So you think he might be getting revenge, because he was done out of a house. - lt does sound stupid, doesn't it? - That would be property madness, all right. l'll bear it in mind. - Come on. And there you go. Hi. - Hello. Happy New Year! - Good boy. - You were looking so happy, we didn't like to disturb you. ls it safe to come near you? - You might be licked to death. - Oh, isn't he gorgeous? - He's a grand old fowler. Are you training him? - Okay, give her a break, training him. So long as he barks at those God Almighty intruders. That's all she needs. - Well, he has a bark, all right. He's made Christmas for me, to be honest. - Of course he has. Come on, come on. What's he called? - Scruffy. - Come on, Scruffy, get the ball, come on. Come on, come on, come on. - We saw the for sale sign. You're doing the right thing. - l hate giving up on it, to be honest. But the break-ins are only part of it. Thought l'd find peace out here, Jess, but there's something wrong about the whole place. Something detached, adrift. l mean, the way people live, the point is they're not really living here. They just sleep over, and they'd actually prefer to be somewhere else. lt's like this whole place just dropped out of the sky and landed in the wrong spot. l'm right on the edge, to be honest. - Oh, come here, love. - Mal must be wondering what sort of a lunatic he's landed with. Scruffy was his idea. lsn't he gorgeous? - The dog or Frank? Would you consider going back to Luke Masterson for a few sessions? - l've been thinking about it. - Come back to us, Molly. You know we'd love to have you. - After all this crapping on about quality before everything, and too many cowboy operations out there, and how she's wise to them because she knows what's what, after all this she decides to go for the beech veneer, tongue and groove job. - And what's that? - l'll tell you, Frank. lt's the second cheapest. That's what it is. Which is also typical, right? l mean, people like her never get the cheapest because they are afraid to look cheap. They get the second cheapest. Which is fine, l mean, no problem for me if she hadn't have stood me there for a half and hour bullshitting about the importance of quality work. So l thought to myself, ''Right, l'm going to make you ''change your mind, Mrs. Klinyhill. ''l'm going to make you feel so bad about picking the second cheapest''... - And he just couldn't, you know, take the order. So l says to her, ''Yeah, yeah, very good, yeah. ''Beech veneer. ''Very popular choice, actually. A lot of people going for that one recently.'' And she's not liking that. ''Makes my job easy, to be honest,'' l says. ''Same old, same old every day, you know? ''Sure, l was in Tulla for two weeks putting that exact floor in a load of houses there.'' [laughter] - Fantastic, Tulla; that would drive her mad. - Oh, isn't he terrible? - l can see it in her eyes at this stage. lt was too easy, actually. l flogged her the solid oak parquet. - Can you believe it? - l don't know what it means, but it sounds impressive. - lt's more that four times the price, Frank. That's what it means. And a 1 2-week waiting list. - More money than sense. - Wouldn't you love to say something to her? - Yeah, soon as she pays up she'll know exactly what l think of her. - You will not. - For sure. lt will be a buzz. - l can see why you'd like to, Mal, but- - She's a bitch. lt's what she deserves, yeah? Yeah? Ah, got you! [laughs] Oh, come on. Did you really think l'd do that, huh? [laughter] - You fecker. l believed you. - Well, you had me. l was thinking, ''Uh-oh, what have we here?'' [laughter] - Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. - Listen, listen. lt's nearly time. all: Ten, nine, eight, seven. - Good night! - Folks, folks, a memorable night. You are generous and gracious hosts. l thank you, and- - Shut up Frank and come to bed. See you in the morning. - Not too early, 1 :00 brunch. - Mal, Mal, Mal, Mal. l'm getting the fuck out of here as soon as l can. Will you stick with me? - Absolutely. - New year, new start. Doesn't matter if it's a hole in the ground as long as it's normal. [dog barking loudly] - [gasping] - Molly, Molly! Molly, Molly, come back. Sweetheart, it's okay. Molly. [distorted voices] Molly, come on. Come back to bed! Everything is okay. Frank, Frank! - Scruffy, Scruffy. Scruffy, where are you, Scruffy? Come here. Come here. Scruffy! Scruffy? Scruffy! [shouting and screaming] Don't do that to me! Why are you letting them do that, Mal? No, no, no, no, no! [shouting] Listen to me. Don't let me sleep! lt's only when l sleep that bad things- bad things-Mal- Scruffy? Scruffy? - You're awake. Wow, that was a marathon. Over 30 hours. How do you feel? - l don't know. - You look good. Really, you do. You needed to sleep so much. - Mal, what happened? - We'll talk about it later. - l don't know what's real and what isn't anymore. Just tell me, please. - Look, it wasn't anything sinister. lt was just an unfortunate accident. You need to rest now anyway. lt's just been one awful thing after another. - What have we done? - Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Jess told the doctor that these- he said maybe you came off them too quickly. So he gave me a prescription. Here. Do you want me to do it? - No. - Ah, Molly, my love, happy New Year. - Will you put these up for me? - 'Course l will. You have a dog? - We had a dog. We don't know whether he ran off or he was taken. - Oh, dear, you've had one awful dose. No doubt about that. By the way, Mossie says thanks for the Christmas prezzie. But no way, he said, would he ever go back to fix your alarm system. - What? - ''No way,'' he said. A bit put out the same Mossie me slagging him over it, you know. ''No, when l install a system, it's done right'' says he. Face on him like a boiled sweet. So is he having me on or what? Huh? - No, just a mix-up. - Will Joe stick them up? - Yeah. - lt might not do any good. You know that? - l know. - Okay. [engine turns over] There you go. - Did you set the alarm? - Yeah. - For what it's worth. - l know, but still. - Actually, no. The worst thing is waiting for it to go off. - Molly. Calm down. - [computerized voice] System is disarmed. - Now at least we won't be lying there waiting for that to start screaming. Why bother locking anything? - Stop it, Molly. Stop it, l said. Let's go to bed, do you hear me? We're not giving in to this. l won't let you give in to it. - Okay, if you like. Whatever. Mossie never came back to fix the alarm. - What? - lsn't that right? Why did you say he did? - Where did you get the idea he didn't? - l don't know what to think. l've gone mad already anyway, fucking mad! [sobbing] - Molly? Molly. Baby, there's someone here to see the house. l won't bring them up here, so you can stay as you are, okay? Okay. [alarm beeping] That's the dining room. South-facing. - Yeah, spacious, actually, yeah. And the oak Shaker kitchen, l like that. - Why didn't you answer the door? - Sorry? - The day l called, why didn't you answer the door? - l don't know what you're talking about. - l was just being a neighbor, just saying hello. - Look, we were at home when you called. We just weren't expecting visitors. - We weren't in the mood for visitors, all right? Do you understand? ls that a problem for you? - No, no it's not. lt's just when you didn't even reply to our invitations... - Oh, God. - Even if it was only to refuse. - We're just not interested in weird stuff. - What's weird about inviting people for Christmas drinks? - Christmas drinks? - Yes! - l don't know what planet you're on- Come on, Peter. - Hold on. - Did you try to buy my house? Was it you or your friend came to view the house the same day l did? - What? - Maybe not, you don't seem- Anyway, it doesn't matter now, 'cause l'm going, l'm gone. We're going away. - ''Dear neighbor, do you wish to open your hearts to God ''and join our group? ''At this special time of year, ''help wash away the sins of the world. ''Spiritual renewal can begin any time. The Church of the Brothers of Christ''- - ''Contact us for more information on induction ''all our welcomers of Christ. Molly and Mal.'' l didn't send this. - Right, so thanks very much, Jeff. Nice to meet you, pal. Thanks for coming over. We'll be in touch, yeah? Have you got a fag? - [gasping] - Good man. - Molly, Molly. - Don't let him in, please. Please don't let him in! Joe! Joe, Joe? - Molly, what's wrong? - Will you do me a favor, Joe? - Well, sure, if l can. - l need a lift straight away. - Well, sure. Why? What's happening? Okay, so Molly, you go round to the front of the shop. - You're not Joe. - Well, of course l am, love. - No, no, you're not. - Molly, hold on! - Jesus Christ. - ls she okay, Moss? - Molly, are you all right? - But his ear is pierced too. - Huh? Not at all. - Oh, this; l didn't get a chance to tell you. - Get away from me. You're both in on it. - ln on what? - Look, listen to him. - l saw the bike, Joe, or Mossie, or whichever one you are. - What are you talking about? - Did you say something? - No. - Molly, come back. - Stop, stop! Stop, stop! - Molly, listen to him! Come here. - l need to get to Dublin, please! - Molly! - Thank you. Thank you so much. ls Luke here? l have to see him. - Dr. Masterson is with his last client for the day. Now, if you want to make an appointment, it will be at least three days. - No, it's an emergency, please. - l'm sorry? - Call him. He knows me. Don't you remember me? - l remember your face. You should know l can't interrupt a consultation under any circumstances. Now, if you want me to make an appointment- Come back here. Hello? Stop! l'm really sorry, Mr. Masterson. - lt's okay. lt's okay, Barbara. lt's okay. What are you doing, Molly? - Please help me. He's doing something to me. He's trying to make me insane. - Who is? - Mal. There's been burglaries, and now l'm sure he's behind it all. And Joe and Mossie are helping him, and l saw the bike, and he's been giving me pills, and look, look. All the neighbors thought l sent these, but it wasn't what l wrote. l wrote invitations to a party. lt was Mal that said, ''Wait till the morning before you post them.'' So he must have replaced them during the night. - Molly, Molly, Molly. - He said that Mossie came to fix the alarm, but Joe made a mistake. - Stop, stop. lt's all right. Now, l'm with someone at the moment. And you know how important it is not to interrupt a session. You know l never allow that, don't you? - l'm sorry, but she said three days. - That's all right. Wait here until l'm finished. Okay? You're safe here, Molly. Will you do that? - Will you be long? - Not long. - He doesn't know about you. He won't find me here. - No. You're absolutely safe here, Molly. [phone trilling] - Yes? l understand. Yes, no problem. Thank you. l'll get you a cuppa. - No, it's okay. - You're grand. lt's no trouble. - Molly. Molly. Molly. Molly, it's been a long while. - l know. l'm sorry. - No need for an apology. Molly, l can't do another session this evening. l don't think it would be a good idea, anyway. - Tea? - No. - So l contacted your friends. l hope you don't mind. - Are you okay, love? - What's going on? - Stay with us tonight, and Luke will see you in the morning. - Yes, when we're fresh. Then we'll sort the whole thing out. Okay? - Come on with us. We feel so responsible. Don't we, Frank? - lndeed. - Do you need something to help you sleep? Luke said you might. - No, l'm exhausted. Thanks, Jess. - Molly, l have to explain something to you. The other night, New Year's Eve, the business with poor Scruffy disappearing, it wasn't a burglary, pet. lt was Frank's fault. He's mortified. He doesn't know what to say to you. He got up during the night to go to the toilet, still drunk, of course, and nothing would do him but go downstairs for a drink of water. He's stumbling around in the dark and bangs off something. Scruffy starts barking. He panics completely and opens the door to let him out, and of course, sets the alarm off. Well, you know the rest. Frank is very upset. Please forgive him, pet. At least you know that Scruffy just went wandering. He might come back. Night-night. - [screaming] - Are you all right, darling? - l'm sorry. l forgot where l was. - Oh, you're safe Molly, love. Don't worry. - Look who's here. - Hello, Molly. Poor baby. Joe promised if he could just meet her, he'd explain everything. - And you'll take her to see Luke in the morning? - Of course, of course. [engine turns over] Molly. Molly. l just wanted it to be you and me, you know? No neighbors coming around for Christmas drinks. What can l say? l'm sorry, all right? l'm sorry. - We're awfully sorry, Molly. - You broke into the house. - Well, not me, but l did know about it. ln all fairness, l have to say that. But it was Mossie, you know. - How many times? - Jesus, Mal, just the once. See, Mossie was raging over the Dublin crowd getting the contract for the alarm. - You didn't stop him? He said he wouldn't do much, and he'd make it up to you on the deal, you know. l can get you the bike now if you want. l don't know what to say. l'm sorry, Molly. - You know, l phoned that stupid fucking guy, the guy who called around this morning. You see, what happened, it was one of those things. l was showing him around, you know, giving him the schpiel. And he said something to me about how he liked the oak Shaker kitchen. But you see, l never mentioned an oak Shaker kitchen. l mean, where did he get it from? - He's the one who saw the house the same day l did, the guy l gazumped. - Yeah, that's what the guard had said. He seemed to know everything. Why didn't you say anything to me? Huh? You didn't trust me. Anyway, he said he'd bring the guy in for questioning. Look, maybe this guy is the one who's been doing all this, and if it is- - How do l know anymore, Mal, if it's him or you or Frank and Jess? - Molly. - Maybe you're all in on it. Luke Masterson, Mossie, Joe. - Mossie and Joe? - Yes! - Molly. Molly! Molly, open up! Molly, open the door! - [computerized voice] System is disarmed. - Molly? Molly. Molly! - Leave me alone. - Please stop doing this to yourself. What do you think is going on here? Do you think l'm trying to hurt you? - l don't know! That's what's driving me mad! You want to drive me mad. - Molly, just let me talk to you. - No, let me sleep. - Sure, but l'm afraid you'll harm yourself if l leave you alone. Molly, l want to hold you. Please, just let me in. Let's hold each other, please. Whatever's been happening is awful, but we'll get through it, Molly. - That's how you did it, yes, yes! That's how you did it, Mal, every time. lt was the panic button, wasn't it? Once you knew l was asleep, you just had to reach out. - [grunting] [alarm trilling] - Oh, for Christ's sake. l can just go down and disarm it. - And l can press it again. You turn off the alarm, and l'll keep turning it on. - Not without the key you can't. Molly. Give me the key, please. This is just- Why would l want to hurt you? All these terrible things, there's nothing connected. lt's just random, baby. lt's all random. lf you give me the key, you can lock yourself in, and l'll leave you alone. We'll get some sleep, and we'll talk about it in the morning. Come on, baby, give me the key. Give me the key! - Okay. Okay, just let me go. Let go! - Okay, okay.
