Where is your friend Castell? Where is the damn order? Here's a bitch, come with me. I regret that can not read. Drop the guns! BORN TO RAISE HELL Headquarters of the international team drug operation. Two weeks ago. After 9 / 11 the U.S. that narcotics were responsible for financing most of the terrorist cell. So they created an international task force. This team is managed and paid by the U.S. government. In addition to the narcotics officers no additional equipment worldwide. Six months ago, they killed my partner. The headquarters has sent me a replacement. I find the person responsible, and bring them to justice. That impact. I regret not having answered before, I tried to reach you since then. Really? I have not missed Bobby. I tried to call but I went to the mailbox. The work comes first, right? Not that I've been busy, soon get to the house. Okay? Shit. Thank you. "Steve, no? My name is Ronnie. I am the team leader Bobby. A year ago that now. Where's Bobby?

What the hell is this? Did you say this room was cleared? Do not secure the room, not looked under the bed. If you want to be police Have to be careful! You put everyone's life in danger. What the hell are you?! You're late. I had a little problem in my neighborhood, I had to solve. I thought you were interested ... making money. I'm a little short. The business is a little short. - Money never should be.|- I understand. When you surrender, will your money. Check this out. Take this home. This will work. Hope to see you in a few days ... with the rest of my money. Yes, a pleasure doing business with you. Son of a bitch. - Have you called us?|- No. Any advance? You were right, the bullets are a 9mm Scorpion. And call us. Will review the site to see if anyone saw or heard something. I think I know the son of a bitch. She speculated a lot, watch them on the flight to London. Hey. Idiot. Mr. Tell your name. Bruce. Let me ask you, because you seem a smart guy. You wait too long, but if you have something good to me may be only half or perhaps something much better. I like his style. - Will cut through the branches.|- Do you agree? I've been in the U.S., I know his style. I'm serious. Yes, I spent much time there, in prison. I met many Americans, intelligent. No offense, I just want us to understand. If I help, it might help me. Got something good or not? Buk want to catch this guy for a long time. Let sigh office for something. Christian, take this man to my desk in a minute I'm here. Tell me when you want to shut him. It seems you're excited. Listen. Why did you hit? You should not hit when I'm holding. Take it a. .. Put it in a tank of urine. He has the look of sexual repression. Is it gay? What do you have? The assault was made by a man named Costello. He and his men like to make raids on the homes. Pajero usually the young and rich. When you see something that catches your eye, follows the woman, beats her, rapes her and then killed. The guy is sick. But that's not all. Women also uses as mules to London. But when Costello found his man, caught him and killed him. - Steve?|- Yes? Do me a favor. Take off the handcuffs on this man and give him a coffee. I need a coffee. Looking for Ronnie coffee, I take off the handcuffs. No problem. I hope you vomit. How can we get there? By Russian, bad business. People say he trained with the military. Why Russian special forces? Traffics in drugs and arms, in droves. Provides all the dust in the market, believe me. Trust is not one of my most spectacular attributes. If you catch Dimitri, the Russian Costel will come up. Would you bring me one to me? What is the problem? Got the seat stuck to butt? Look it up yourself, I'm working. There's good news and bad. The good news is that will take me to that address. The bad news is that you do not drink coffee. Come on! But Dimitri knows that I captured. So I'll give you a bonus. Let's move. Come on! There you go. - Are you sure there is no problem?|- Yes You can not play with this guy. You think I like to play? I just want to cover my ass. You better get up Costel. Find the truck and go. - I'm nervous.|- You should be. I have not usually this lucky. Nerves are good, keep you alert. Psychics never do. You see many American films. Do not worry, you'll be watching in the park. What? I need to recharge. Do not you Americans were arrested yesterday? I was released. The police are stupid. Bring a copy of the record, then we'll talk. It was what you asked me, what more do you need? No need anything, you do. Just try to do business, stay in the game. - How much?|- Mil. You doubled your business. So, to recover from my losses. Hard work, less sleep. The price has risen. Okay, I have no choice. You're a confident man. Yes, I need therapy for that. We will continue this conversation later. Come see me in two days. That will close the business. I need that shit now. I said that in two days. Yeah, sure. I'm sorry. Frank is moving. Let's see if you're lucky. That was why I brought you, you're so lucky. There are about 4 players in this side. Shit, they seem to come down here. Yes, we burned. Do not move. What it does I lost it. Where? Do not move. We're burned, you were right. Come out wherever you are. We know they're there. Bastards. Listen, I think they know what they do and if not eventually take you to jail. Fuck American police. Let me see your hands bloody! - There is a backup pair of handcuffs.|- Good work. Ronnie burned us. Copied. Dad ... look at my picture. What drew? Beautiful, my son. You and me in the park. I have better plans for you to be in that park. Andra ... hurry. We gotta get this tonight. What do you think?"|- Let's do it. Exit the vehicle. "I can see your license and your movement? Why? It is part of an investigation ... - Is it American?|- Yes Why do you care about my license and my circulation? Well, not wanting to be rude and say so abruptly, but it is an investigation with the IDTF, and we need to talk to you. - There you go.|- Thank you. Do you mind if we take a look at your car? - No problem.|"Fine. Beware, it's Armani. Is clean. Is it yours? I had never seen. I guess that is not licensed to carry firearms. I told him I had never seen. Well, espsalo and put it back. Watch your head. Look to see what the serial number. It is in this country Why live this way? Should be hunting terrorists in Afghanistan, not me. We did, now we moved here. The same as that found at the scene. It was what I thought. Do you want to call the locals? - Be careful with your back.|- I will. Shit. This idiot did us good. Know that I will complain to his superiors for making me this. Do it. Americans are notorious for their brutality. You know, we also take pride in that. Want to get rid of the charges of carrying weapons? There is one with whom you do business, Castell, - Is full of shit.|- Like what? Assault, invasion, murder, raped women alive and dead is a nice guy The perfect man to join him. I am a family man. My wife and my son are sacred to me. Seems to be chasing this guy in my stead. If you have a problem with this guy get busy yourself. That I do. I talked with the old ... on Costel. It froze very quickly. Maybe another day in prison so soft. I think in Siberia is worse than here. - quite so ... In the U.S. you see on TV, in Russia the bastards you're watching. Yes? Do you mean by experience? It is self-harm to blame, - A smart move.|- It's going to sue, saw the trick in the book, so what? He does not want a lawsuit, want us to depart. What We Do We dropped into Russian? Dimitri going to press, he takes us to Castell. - There is something I want to say.|- What is it? How much I admire and want to be like me. Yes, that too. But more important. - I'll be dad in a month.|- Really? I was not expecting. Relax, I'm not the first that works in one case when his wife is about to give birth. I guess we'll be more careful. Sorry I'm late, you know how it is. No problem, you know I love you. What's going on honey? How did hear about your sister? Well, the man got the job. Want something to drink? Want to drink? The usual. "Fine.|Thank you. Look for it. Do not you remember me? Yes It's amazing how a piece of shit like you may be in the street so fast. Come here. Do you see why we do not go to dinner? Out! Fuck me, whose house is this? Do not forget who pays the rent queer. Idiot. Unconsciously, I wanted to fail, - I'll call you later.|- Do not bother. Damn! Who taught you to drive?! Looks like it was my bike! That is, come here! Leave the car! It's done. It is the nature of this business we have some shit. But we've had enough. Not happen again. It should not happen in the first place! Is this country look like us. They're giving information to police. Not a shit more. No fucked up the job. Thanks to your health. His personality has not changed anything. Just as planned. Just what I wanted to hear. Come on! Come here. I'm ready to go. You do not have to worry about. I hate to admit, but good job. We need to find information on women who are taking the drug to London. What? The dead are my life. Who died now? Your informant, can not remember his name, according to the records. He signed it two days ago. When he died? About 9 o'clock this morning. It looks like a professional job. A shot to the head. There were no witnesses. Any idea of the suspect? The one was in custody. You may not have anything better than that. They do not. That's the ultimate, right? No, Adrian did not make the delivery this morning. The son of a bitch is late again. You wrong your kindness for weakness. Are you going to start preaching? We are negotiating with Adrian. Tomorrow we collect the cash and throw away. After we take care of Dimitri. Come on baby. Let me help. Listen, when we started I said you understood it was police, and police must work hard outside the home ... you know, not ideal for a relationship but it seems you have no problem with that. Honey, I understand you're under pressure. I just wish that were to put the work before me. And I do not. I know it's difficult, but upon termination of this case ... Do not say something we both know that's not true. You know I love you. You're right, do not worry about anything. I did not want to make a scene, I just wanted to apologize. That's why I love you. - I have something for you.|- Really? Listen guys. The lens is located at the university. Caroline Side Boulevard. We will work with local and can be a Stadpa, probably related to our objective, Costello, who want to catch. We know that one of their riders, Adrian, will be there today. These are recent photos of some of his accomplices. There is more to the table. We have no Adrian. I want to remember something, level is a case of "Street". This means that although we have surveillance depending on time of day from a raid to a nursery. Anything else boss? I want two soldiers back. If we can not break resistance, abort code is "Eco" Any questions? What weapons do they have? We know they have Scorpions 9mm and several assault rifles in the house. Is everything clear? Are left behind if we pursue someone. Let them. Do not play with it, save it. Do we have enough ammunition? I have 6 clips for each. - What backup?|- We have enough. Listen, now you do watch, I will put you in the rear. You'll have a baby. Are you serious? Do I look like a comedian? Police! Pick up the phone. What the fuck you want? Come on, take her damn phone! Dime. Costel, the police are here! I have surrounded! Retreat. Fuck. A Stadtpad, now! Down! Damn! Costel Are you there?! Drop your weapon. Do not move, breathe, release the weapon. -Please. - Come here.|- Okay. Come here. Espsalo and record it. Shit. Suave. Have to Adrian. Tour, we will return. Good job. Where's Costello? - Find it yourself.|- I will. Did they give you? Only the vest. Dimitri is here. Want something else sir? No, thanks. Mr Costello will come soon. Look at this place. Do you think that what the police told you is true? It is not my concern. At least until I have my money. Sit. I feel that our relationship is fading. Did business in your apartment then in the park and now I am the host. Where is my money? Well, there was a small problem. There was a raid on one of my apartments. And this is my problem? Why? Was your friend the agent. She took my heart because I do business with you. I lost a lot of money, 50 thousand. If not tomorrow I have my money you're dead. Do you dare to threaten my business?! IDTF agent ... specifically asked for you, and it was not just to sell drugs. I know you do, who we fight among ourselves. The shit he said, me the creeps. If you find that is true, back and I'll kill you. Later. Later. The hosts suffered three casualties, will you. Well, I put three rounds. I think I know who shot Adrian. Do you think it Costel? A million percent that he was sure. Stop. Recedes. This is the street. Well guys, crouch. Need Help? Well, hide the body and catch the keys. Expected to return. Let's do this. Return to the home. Do you think you could hide?! Where's the baby?! You did not kill her! I had to tell us where was the money! Come out and watch both! I'll take care of the child! Nobody from, close the door when you go! Surrender. My family! Stupid gypsy. All is well, I'm here. Your father is here. Take it. Will not you die? Where are you? Two blocks west, behind the building. You in the corner. Shit. Are you really so stupid? Where is Costello and the other man? I do not know. Bitch you smell fear. Fuck you bitch! They're dead! You want to die like that? Why?! Do not stay here, go back. This is the address registered. It seems that someone has passed through here. Drop the gun! Damn! I have code red, officer injured. We are in the First Floor club. I need help and fast. Make pressure there. Go after the bastard. Right back. No way! Come to the front. Damn. Hi boss. I found out what happened. I'm sorry. So you know, they sent an investigator, questions that were in the club. My superiors look the same response. I wish I had asked for reinforcements. Me too. They have a huge task force dedicated to justice. You have all these men walking around, this man is no command. I do not understand. I come to see Robert Samuels. Wait here. This man is a wizard, or command, or trained soldier, he is not Jesus is a damn gypsy. As these two types. Dimitri is looking for you. If you do not solve this find someone else. Tell him to come. What? Need to talk to you. Sit. About what? What about him? Is responsible for killing my wife. And from what I heard, your partner, I think we both want revenge. - Listen.|- I veteran, thou Costel. And I can take revenge on this man for the death of my wife. Are you serious? I shall soon know where you are. When it does, I will tell all where he hides, where is the rest of the money and drugs. I only ask that you make the eye blind what I do to this man. This is not the place to discuss this, but I understand perfectly, more than think about what might happen. Do me a favor. Call me soon. And see what happens. The cell phone call within 24 hours with the time and place. Tell me who found the damned. We found some of his men. Is in a complex. I want no part in this. We're just the agent and myself, understand? Until we have finished. I want you to take my son home. This country has taken away a lot. I have a place. Come tonight. Are you alone? My people are close, but do not interfere with. Let me tell you something, you're a gangster, Technically, we can not ... not be seen together. As I was saying ... - You give me your word?|- Yes My people told me that within the apartment complex. How many?|4. If you do not go out in 10 or 15 minutes happens, it will be all yours. Just remember our agreement. What are you doing here? - Are you okay?|- Yes High Remember our agreement. I do not want to kill him, just hurt. Is there. Shit! Continue north on the street Ducth. I hear you breathe. It was not me who killed her, was Costel. Where's Costello? Shit! Shit! Romance in the bar, Romance Bar, East Side, is awaiting pickup. My son told me he shot his mother. To whom it described to me ... is you. My boys are on the way better you go from here. Just go. Romance is in the bar. Get out of my way. Keep your eyes open. Be alert. Where is your friend Costel? Where is the damn order? This is my command. Come with me bitch. I regret that can not read. Put the gun down! Shit! Let's see what you have. Damn! There you bitch. You win, you win. As head of the command, the worst that can happen is you lose men. I lost two men, my partner and his replacement Steve. Since I came here, I hope it's worth. Only a brilliant strategist could beat me in a move. Can only be the hands of one person. A man of honor always keeps his word. That was the deal. I was thinking ... men like us there are things that are hard to say and listen, but I have to say I'm sorry for your loss. I thought it would be nice if you take your child to their country, and it would be good for you too. Funny you should say. It's exactly what I was thinking. - Great minds think alike.|- What is that? Tickets. You know you know you are a man of means, this is just a gesture of respect. Neither belong here, my friend. My job is done, now I can go, find a warm place. Take a break. You've been one of the good.
