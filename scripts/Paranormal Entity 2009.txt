Your welcome. It was a wonderful dinner. Thomas... I just want to ask... I understand that Dr. Lauren wants us to do this whole thing... But... that only has cameras in our rooms and not on yours? Because... you would not like see what happens in my room. Someone would like to... say something... on our experiment here? How you will make money with the fact that... I will not make money from nothing! Mr. Medium said to document everything, then, what better way to do this than with a camera? - And why do not you write? - I will not write it. Last fall, Thomas Finley was arrested by rape... ...and murder of his sister aged 19, Samantha Finley. He also was convicted of murder Lauren Edgar, a paranormal investigator. Thomas says that the victims were attacked by a demonic entity of unknown origin. He committed suicide soon after, while in prison. The recording below was found a year later, hidden in the attic of the family. Is being shown to the public the first time. We are running... Testing, testing, one, two, three. Camera focus. And here we are. Thomas Finley... This is my fourth. Here is where I sleep. Today is the day off the employee. We're walking down the aisle... to the living room. We have a camera... corner... Filming in night vision... with a battery of 8 hours... to shoot all night and pra that we can see... whatever happens... this room. This is the fourth of Samantha. We have a... camera on the tripod, recording in night vision battery with 8 hours to film whatever happens or not happen. And then... if we go down the hall... Sorry. Shit... And the mother's room, we have a camera in the corner... Mother Mother This is the daddy? First night October 32:06 Hi, you've reached the Finleys. We can not answer now, But if you leave a message; we will return. Thank you. Good morning. Someone is wonderful this morning. Great. What we are doing pro coffee? You will make me... I will not do anything for you. I'm doing this to myself. This seems to vomit. Is, do something for you. I see that someone is a great mood this morning. I know. Especially when they call my food vomiting. It makes me really happy. It makes me great. You do not have a job or something to do? Today I am officially unemployed. Oh, I'm shocked. Really shocked. See, this is my surprise face. Ah, that's good. Yes it is recording? Is that I'm surprised for you being unemployed. I think I'll win an award for it. It is a real loser. So... um... Some dad's visit tonight? Not funny. Let your sister in peace, Tommy. Ok? Just stop. What about you, mother? Something happened that night? He made coffee, Sam? No. Mother - Yes, Tommy. - Something happened? - I do not want to talk about it. - I think we should talk. I think it is important to discuss about what is happening in this house. - Turn off the camera. - And what is happening. Turn off the camera. I think if you say who is talking to Dad... Turn that damn camera! About a year my husband David... died in a car accident. And I'm sorry to miss him. There is even a day I do not think it... A couple of months... I just started talking to him. Know... I just... Just got a... talk, pretending store very strange... weird... And there was a lady there, and she was telling us that... You can actually... can speak with the dead... writing for them. So I said, "Okay. " So I went home e... I picked up a pen and a pad of paper... I started writing one night. I wrote e... just wrote... E... I felt that something was me... was taking care of me. I just... I felt I was really talking with David and that he was really responding, you know? I mean... each... every word I wrote... it was as if he were there with me. And then every night I went to my room and wrote to him and he answered me. I really think I was talking to David. But then these... Then some strange things started happening e... I do not know, it's like... I do not know... bad things... Things happening riuns with Samantha. Bad things happening. That is not David, OK? David does not... not do these things. What do you think that is? I do not know. I do not know. I do not know what the hell is this. Whatever it is, not his father. What was that? Oh shit! He left. Christ. And the camera is... on. 'm In the next room. Monday night October 43:43 Tommy! What? I found this on the floor. Give me that. What I am saying to Sam is... ...that it is possible that the cross has fallen from the wall. And ended up in the corner...? Things do not fall from the walls, hit the ground and move to the corners. No, they do not fly diagonal e... - Who said that? - Things do not square roll. I did not say rolled, but what if the wall fell diagonally... I was far away. So you can have kicked... And if she kicked? What if... No, if the cross fell from the wall, that does not mean she kicked, that's what I'm saying. I do not like the fact that you suggest that your sister is lying. - I'm not suggesting that. - You are. I even said that she lying. Well, these things may have happened. If the cross fell from the wall, it does not means that the ghost dropped. - No, no, you're right. - Not to say that the ghost did it. You're right... Did not mean it. Yes, I am sure, Sam. Yeah, you're totally right. Not mean anything. There is nothing happening here, Mom. I just say that this does not mean anything. Yeah, he's trying to say that this gives a good scene pra a fucking movie, that's all. Shut up, damn it, really. I'm tired of hearing you say that. - I do not give a damn. - Stop with the words, OK. Stop! Stop! I want you to stop! Stop! Christ! Hallo. He has to keep shit camera on?! In fact, he does not live here anymore. No. Okay. Bye. Great. Very well done... fucking asshole. Mother Hallo. Hallo. Aloo. Sam. Last night, my cross fell from the wall. Only I'm sure it was played there. Thomas refuses to believe me. Or he does not want. 'm Very scared. Please God, help me! Where are You? Why am I seeing this? Hein. Hi Sorry for yelling. Why do you say that now I'm ready to sleep? Why an apology and I thought I would go on record. But you still think I do not believe in you. - You do not believe. - I believe. Everything is confusing, you know. So sorry, I do not wanted to scream. Legal? Yes Cool. Cool. See you tomorrow. Thursday Night 7 October 1:02 David? David? Tommy! Tommy! Tom! What? You did that? I did what? Wrote on the table. - What the fuck? - Not funny, man. Look, I did not. Mother! - What the hell does that mean? - Mom - What? - U C. Come here! U C... Mom, you did it? No. No! I did not write it. Someone wrote! What does it mean? Do not you remember doing that?

I mean, never heard of anyone sleepwalker and writing at a desk... I do not know, Thomas, not I have no idea. And you do not know what to write? - You do not know what it means? - I do not remember being lifted. So you do not know what the letters on the table mean? No. And you took the paper to somewhere. You were with the paper in hand. Oh, God. And that's all. It's very bizarre mother. Thomas... What's wrong with me? There is something wrong with me. I do not remember any of it. What the hell is happening? I'm going crazy! Mom, I think it has something happening in this house. Do not know if there is something wrong with you. There is something wrong with this house. Where is this doctor? Dr. Lauren, I called him several times, he is still on vacation. And he goes on to say that when you return he will come back here as soon as possible. He knows what's going on? He know what is happening with Samantha? Because... um... mother... I think she is going crazy with it. I increasingly I think all has something to do with it. I know, of course...

Sure. Or I'll find someone else. OK. You okay? I'll think of something. I'll think of something. So I... There is a time, I began to feel like... if something was in the room... me while I slept. When I was trying to sleep... And then... a week ago... I woke up for something... I do not know what woke me up... I could not... out of bed. I was just... lying there... and I could not sit, ... I could not turn my head to see what woke me up... I just... And then it was as if... something came... and pressed... my chest, very strong. It was as if... was holding me, as if... did not want me to move. It was very strange, it took everything... I... All energy that I could check for... to sit... and look around the room... It was as if someone was me squeezing with one hand... But then... I got up e... turned on the lights e... there was nothing... ...I thought I mean... the time I thought I was crazy... and then these other things started happening... I just do not understand why this is happening to me. So this was the first time that happened? Yes Do you think it will happen again? I do not know. I do not know, it's like every time I go to sleep, I was lying there e... wanting to sleep, but if I... if I sleep, I'm afraid wake up and happen. and if I stay up, nothing happens, then... So I did not even sleep e... I do not know. And no one comes out winning. Nobody wins. Friday Night 8 October 2:34 Tommy! Tommy! Open the door! - Tommy... stop! - Open the door! It's okay, I'm here!

They just need... Heard you for a few days... But... I just like to say I'm sorry. I should have listened to you. I should be there for you. And Samantha. And I was not. I just like to say I'm sorry, Mom. I want us to be a family again. What's happening? Dr. Lauren, hello. Between. This is my sister, Samantha. - Hello, Samantha, nice to meet you. - Also. Thanks for coming. If I could come here earlier, I would... I want to say how I feel from what I heard about your mother. How is she? She is... okay. She has to stay under observation, but... She'll be fine. - Well, if I could I would be here before. - You can make it stop? I'll try. Samantha, I understand all events here... acontedendo are in your room. - Yes - Take me there. Here. Ok Ok First, I want to thank the two did not go away. Because that would follow. And probably leave this thing more angry. So I think you acted right for calling me. We just want to make it stop. I understand, Sam. Same. But I want to assure them that there is an incredible presence in this house. It is a very negative presence. And it's very attracted to you, Sam. Now, as I understand it, his mother tried to make contact, or believes he made contact... with his father. Is this true? Yes Ok, now... What made her think that she was exposed? Ah, she was writing him... She was writing to him and then... she thought he was responding. Ok Well, that... This is quite common, because when... when someone loses a loved one... and try to make contact with this person... They sometimes do not know... Invite an obscure entity. It's like an open door, so to speak. A free pass. And most of the time is that this entity personifies... and takes the place of that loved one... to enter our world. For some reason. Ok? And in this case... I believe... Sam is the reason. Ok Then... Before we begin, I want you to know... I want you to think... Is there anything I have forgotten. Anything that can tell me. I just wanted... show it. We do not know what it means. Ok Maron... is Germanic for "nightmare". Ok? In Germanic folklore... a nightmare is an evil spirit... attacking women while they sleep. Much like the Christian Incubus... that violent women. Ok? Now, before you start, I just want to... are extremely, extremly clean. And I have 100% of your attention and its concentration. Yes Sam? Ok Samantha! Samantha! Oh, my God, damn! Oh, Samantha! Samantha! Samantha! Samantha! Samantha! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Samantha, oh my God! Samantha! Oh, my... Oh, my God! Oh, my God! On October 25, the bodies were removed from the residence of Finleys. The body of Samantha Finley was found dead in the arms of his brother. With the news of the death of their children, Ellen Finley took his own life in hospital. It is the opinion of the people closest Finley family... ...that this video is shown to the public as a final testimony of inexplicable and terrible events occurred in their Finleys.
