Something we programmed here If two dots get too close, they die, but if they get too far apart, they're drawn closer Huh...what's it for? A miniature model of our world... But only the grad student who designed it understands it I wouldn't... Suggest staring at it too long Sorry, it's a mess Thank you There you go - Have a drink - Thank you Getting the data? Yeah, almost set What got you started on the internet? Nothing in particular... You don't like computers, right? No Wanted to connect with other people? Maybe...I don't really know Everybody else is into it People don't really connect, you know What?

Yes? Isn't Yabe acting strange? You think so? Can I go check on him? Fine, but... It might be a waste of time Words said in friendship with the best of intentions always winding up hurting your friends deeply And then you wind up getting hurt Is friendship always that way? If that's so, what's left? If I were you... Who needs friends like that? A courageous choice in itself Are you OK? Did something happen? If something happened, let's talk about it Both Junco and I, are really worried I saw... A face... What? A horrible face... I've never seen anything like it... What are you saying? What did you see? The Forbidden Room Forbidden Room? What's that? Is that... The room with the red tape? Don't dare go in there! Please, tell me What happened? I'm cold Yabe... Are you OK? ''Exit'' Harue Hi I don't really use the library much Couldn't find the way out Phantoms You're reading this? Yeah Is it related to your work in the lab? Yeah Huh... Do you have a minute? What?

Let me know if anything happens Yeah, sure Karasawa san I need you to check this Yes And you are? My friend, Kawashima Huh... The grad student, Yoshizaki san Hello I forgot to give you my number Oh, right Call me, OK? Right Anytime, OK? Yeah Thank you ''Everyone dies, therefore there's no logical reason for ghosts not to exist ''How many ghosts have... existed since prehistoric times?'' Do you see it too? Sure you do, because it's really there Who is that? You'll have to catch him to find out Start right now, and you might succeed Have a go? What? Why don't you, right now? He disappeared I see He must be a student... I don't know him Maybe you're right. Sorry I encouraged you See you Wait a minute Just what was that? I'm cold... The spirit... Or consciousness, the soul, whatever you want to call it, it turns out the realm they inhabit has a finite capacity Whether that capacity accommodates billions or trillions, eventually, it will run out of space Once it's filled to the brim, it's got to overflow somehow, somewhere But where? The souls have no choice but to ooze into another realm, that is to say, our world Maybe, at first... it started with something really simple Once that realm reached critical mass, any device would have sufficed Thrown it together with the means and materials at hand That's how I see it Excuse me, do you have any tape? Anything'll do, some tape How's this? Thank you After many hours or days, or many weeks, it finally happens Through that process, it spreads around the world But now they're no longer the faint presence they began as You saw one yourself I don't believe your stories Right, sorry, it's all hypothetical Thanks for the tea Are you OK? Just fine But if this really happened, there's no turning back No matter how simple the device, once the system's complete, it'll function on its own, and become permanent In other words, the passage is now open... that's how it looks Hello Oh, I see, our boss isn't there? Yes, I understand If he does stop by, Will you pIease ask him to call us? Yes, thank you very much Michi, what do you think is going on? Why's everyone disappearing? Oh, hello, this is Sunny Plant Sales calling Thank you for your business Is our boss there with you by any chance? Oh, I see...Thank you, and excuse me I'll go look for him Wait, Junco, wait Yes, hello... Boss? Help Yabe! Are you Yabe? Yabe! Help me... Help me... Help... Help... Junco... Junco! Junco, no! Junco! Are you OK? Are you OK? Help me... Help me... Help me... Junco! Look, I'm right here I'm right here, it's OK Excuse me Karasawa Harue tel: 090-4079-2677 What are you doing, Harue? You're dripping wet! They went away... They've all disappeared... They always do... I have to run away... Run away somewhere... Harue! Hey, Harue! Listen, Harue! Harue! Calm down! Harue! Thank you... I always wondered what it's like to die... From when I was realy little... I was always alone Any parents or family? Sure, but they're irrelevant Right... That after death, you live happily with everyone over there Can we stop talking about this? But it may be true Sure, but... Then in high school it dawned on me you might be all alone after death, too There's no way to know How could you? The idea was so terrifying I couldn't even bear it That nothing changes with death, just right now, forever Is that what becoming a ghost is about? You can't mess with that It's really bad What have ghosts got to do with us? Besides, we're alive Then, who are they? Are they really alive? How are they different from ghosts? In fact, ghosts and people are the same, whether they're dead or alive It's not right. It's wrong They're all crazy Nobody knows what happens when you die All this about ghosts, but I won't believe in them, even if I see one But I do know that I'm definitely alive and so are you, Harue That's for sure, right? So I don't want to think about the fact we'll die someday Just maybe... In 10 years, or at least while we're still alive, they'll invent a drug that prevents death Then, we could live forever and ever Of course you might think I'm crazy to say that, but... I'd rather bet on that You want to live forever? Yeah That sounds like fun? Yeah...That's what I think Huh...Maybe I've got it all wrong No... It'll turn out just like you say I'm sure What? Ghosts won't kill people Because that would just make more ghosts Isn't that right? Instead, they'll try to make people immortal By quietly... trapping them in their own loneliness Help... Help... Junco, It'll be OK It'll be OK OK... I fell asleep... How do you feel? Yeah Something to drink? How about some coffee? Michi... What? Am I just going to die like this? Of course not That's right... I'll just keep on living, all alone... What? No Junco! Junco! Junco! Junco! Why! Why! Junco, don't go! Junco! Mother? Mother? Mother! I'll be right there Harue... Harue! Hey... Kawashima...take me with you I'm scared to be alone Take me somewhere OK, sure Where to? Somewhere far away Out of Order Shit, let's just go! There's no one... No... Where did everyone go? I'm here I'm here beside you Even if, there's no one else, it doesn't matter We are both definitely here Guess that's true... What happened? I've got to go back! What? No! We've come this far! But this is the end of the line That's not true. It'll start moving I'll go check with the driver. Come with me OK, but promise you'll wait right here I'll be right back. Promise Harue! The Forbidden Room Construction Materials - red tape I'm... Not alone... Harue, it's me, Kawashima Harue! Listen! Listen, what do you say to this? The two of us live together That way, we can always be together If we keep living alone, we'll just get worse and worse because we're weak We'll balance each other out How about living that way? Would you try it with me? What do you think, Harue?! Harue! Harue! Harue!

So many things happened at once, it's impossible to sort them all out Yeah Me too. My head's all messed up So you're a student, Kawashima? Yeah Lucky you I don't think so Here Oh, thanks... And you? I had a job Wow, amazing Nothing amazing Did you have any friends? Friends? Maybe one, I guess What was she like? What? I don't really know... I never really found out... Where is she? Somewhere... OK, try starting it OK, good Why don't you look for her? What? She's still somewhere, right? You've got to help her then But... Let's go find her. I'll help you This is the last stop... After that we go as far as we can I can sort of see... The future... ''Help'' Look over there An abandoned factory? I wonder... Shall we try it? Listen, even if you see a door sealed with red tape, don't go near it, OK? I know You OK? Look...at this Look...over there Kawashima Harue! Watch out! What happened, Harue! What are you doing with that? Let's get out of this place together Together? Yeah C'mon, hand it over Harue! Harue! Oh, no, a hospital... Harue! Don't die! C'mon! Please! Help me! Harue! We couldn't save her... No... We're out of gas... I'll get some, there was gas back there You'll be OK? Wait for me. I'll be OK Forever... death was... eternal Ioneliness... Help... Don't ask me! What's that got to do with me! Forever... death was... eternal loneliness... You're not real I refuse to acknowledge...Never... I refuse to acknowledge death! I know I'll catch you Then you'll disappear That's it, right? Right? You can't beat me! I am... real... Kawashima! What is it? Forget it...Let's go... It's too much... What...are you doing? You went in there... Me? Yeah, I did, but I'm fine Don't cry You want to go back? To what's left of Harue? That makes you feel better? If that's what you want, I'll go with you No... Let's go... As far as we can go Are you sure about that? Yeah Can you get out? You OK? Be careful Wait here, OK? Death comes to us all... If so, maybe we would have been happier, had we gone with the rest But we chose to keep going into the future... We'll head for Latin America We're still getting signals there Though they're pretty weak We've got to give it a try, no matter what we find If anyone's survived, we can head out again and go... as far as we can C'mon, be strong Have I done the right thing? Yes Are you sure? Yes You're doing the right thing Now, alone with my last friend in the world, I have found happiness
