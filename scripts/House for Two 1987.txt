Dan, work something out. I'll give a five, if she shows me her legs. What other would you like? A five is too little, legs are for twenty. Here, but it has to be on the table. Well, good. So go. - No! - But, Janicka... - Beer! - That's right, beer! On the table! Look, striptease. Good. Go on! - Aaa! - Great! Don't step on my cigar end. She steps like a ballet dancer. Good, ay?

Brother, don't talk silly. - You can lend me one hundred, can't you? - Ask mum. What? Are you such a redneck? Am I supposed to wake up mum because of this? Yeah. And when you wake up her, you can tell her everything. About Magda, too. So come to pay it, and then we can go through it. Yeah? - Boo! - [laugh] Do you want to have a drink? Wait! Look, money! Come here! Come here too me! - Hi, and thanks. - Hi. Let's go. So, start. Put the glasses away. Kill me then! You will marry the girl. You don't understand it. I'm going to the army tomorrow. - You'll take my suit. - No. - And you'll ask her for a hand. - No. - Here are the money for flowers. - No. You can't be serious. Boza, it won't work. I'm not into the marriage, really! Maybe mum will excuse you, but not me. Shit! [Music] [Knocking on a door] What's up? - [knocking] - C'mon. It can't be on fire something. I'm coming. Is that you? Where do you have her? I'm alone today, greybeard. Tomorrow I'm going to the army. The payment is the same. Alone or with a chick. - But you'll give me a bottle. - Yeah, but fifty fifty. What a scrooge you are. Greybeard, how long have you been married? I've never been married. Long live the army, greybeard. They'll put you in the line. [Music] Is he at home? He called that he wouldn't come. - He dislikes saying goodbye. - Did he say something else? So you won't be angry. Magda Koulova. What will be a name of the boy? I don't know. What about after a daddy. What's his name? Does it hurt you? It hurts. Let's go to the surgery. [Music] [Cry of a baby] When Herodes saw, that the three kings fooled him he got angry very much and killed all children, dwelling in Betlehem and all around it, from two years and lower according to the time, on which he asked the kings. It fullfiled the word of Jeremiah, the prophet, saying: Voice be heard, crying and weeping of many [Music] Good day, I'm Whistle. Is Magda at home? Come in. Zdenicka, come here! - So that's him. - Good day. - What do you say about him? - Why don't you want to marry the girl? - Hello. - Hello. - That's not him. - What? He's a little bit confused. Who is he then? Explain it to him. Invite him inside. Come to the next room. It depends, how would Magda decide. I personally would... Daddy, please, let us. What do you know about her? Do you at least whose child it is? - It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter? What if he's a rogue? But he is, I don't doubt it. Otherwise he would marry her. Alright. Boza, I mean well to you. Where did you put your brain? I think I would have to move. Don't worry, but we can't stay here. You promised you overbuild the house. You'll do the bathroom to me. And you wanted to repair the chimney. I will. But I don't want it for you anymore. I'll wait for Dan, you know? You don't have to invite me to the wedding. It is Dan. I didn't know he does it. - Can I release it? - Sure. [Music sounds] When Dan was attending the second class, there was a competition in kite-flying. He made such a horrible box and won. I was fifteen then, and wanted to beat him. Why are you saying me it? Just so. [Music] [Cry of a baby] C'mon, shhh... We're off. [Music] - Your bag, sir. - Right then. - What's this? - I just wanted better to watch it. - Hello, when did you return? - Hello, yesterday. We could go somewhere, what? Pardon. Have you talked to mum? Come in. Sit down, I'll be back in a minute. - Hello. - Hello. Dan is here. [Child is smiling] Hello. Hello. Would you like some tea? Why not. I'll make it. What about the army? Quite well. I'm off. Wait, don't be silly. You can't leave like this. [Music] What about the bathroom? - Will you make it too? - Yeah, sure. Hello. Wait. You're still with the children. Let me be. [Music] [Cry of a baby] [Music] I would like only to say something to you. Something important. It could help you. He wasn't your brother. I wasn't able to bear children, so we adopted him. And then you were born to us. I said to myself that you should know. Where are you going, Dan? Beer! Beer! - You don't have money. - Swine. Let's drink on my brother. Choose! Let be. Go, go. [Dan sings] In Hodonin For a soldier, they recruited me Dan, don't be silly and go home. Come. Sokol, fine. Aaaa! [Music] I'm going upstairs, if they will give me brother's machine. I thought... In fact, I told myslef... - Do you need something? - That would be from you? - You'll need to think it through. - And what, I beg your pardon? - I don't need anything. - What about... What about you'll marry again? And I would be the one who would marry you. I mean it. I thought it all through. Your name would be the same. And children too. Go away, Dan. Go away! - Get lost. - Magda, I will love you. - I will love you all. - Get lost now! [Music] Yes. Sure. Of course not tonight. - I want to speak with you. - Wait a little. By a tram. Of course, by a tram. A fan, grandpa. You, of course. No, not by a car. Not at a... It is out of the question. [Music] [Street noise] [Music] Boza! [Music] What are you doing here?
