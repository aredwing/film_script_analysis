Sir Euge, Congratulations! Mico, you're really great! - Thank you. - You were able to catch up! You're the best! Thank you. Thank you, Uncle Ricky. Thank you. Can you give us some comments, please. Well you know it always feels great to win. I won because of my Velocity Max shoes. To prove a light weight technology. It's lighter and faster. So go to your Momentum store and ahh... check it out. Alright! Thank you. Thank you. Eugene. Good job! - Thank you, Tatang. - Oh... wow! Okay we have the president of Momentum Athletics... Of course, Mr. Ricardo Arceo. What can you say about this event? Well, ifs good to see a lot of people gathered here... For one goal. Sir, that was a close fight. Did you expect that? Well, I expected to win. - Oh my gosh, really? - Congratulations! - Thanks guys. - I'm so proud of you. - Daddy, happy birthday! - Well done! Getting accepted in the Massachusetts General Hospital... For a fellowship training is no joke. - Congratulations! - Thanks Euge! Would you believe, I applied there. And I wasn't accepted. Well, what does it mean mom? I'm smarter than you. I know that. That's why I'm so proud of you. - Son well done! - Thanks daddy! He really takes after you. Well, whose footsteps do you think he'd follow? You tell me. What happens now to your patients? Oh you' re right. Dad, you can have my pedia cardio patients. Okay. I have cases that have congenital heart disease and atrial defect. Mom, you can take my patients who have asthma. Fine! You're more superior then. But seriously, this is such a blessing for you, Tony. Yeah, you make me proud son. - Hey dad. - Yes. - You are really brilliant! - This is my gift. It's my most expensive shoe. All the materials used here are top of the line. - Really? - Yes. Nice! That's what I used when I won the marathon a while ago. Yeah, we saw that on TV. Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Thank you! Can I have one too for my rounds? Why, is it your birthday? Just buy yourself one. It' s so expensive. My fellow interns in the ER also like it. But they say it's not practical. That's true Eugene. It might be too expensive that no one will buy it. No, actually ifs doing really well. - Good. - Really, huh, really. Dad, by the way, herds my gift. I know this, I know this. - Panying? - Yes? - Please put these aside first. - Ok. Thank you son. You really know what I want. Of course! That's why you even have the same profession. Hi Eugene! Here. There's a gum. Good morning, sir! Let's go. Hey Mico, you're so early. You seem prepared. I hope it gets approved this time. Good morning, Sir Euge! Sir, the deliveries from China have arrived. Eugene. Sir, what about the approval for the new designs? - Hi sir! Good morning! - Good morning! What do you think after Singapore? Our next target would be China. Or let's try the US. We have bigger opportunities in China. - We can do it! - No doubt about it. You were able to make our shoes number one here. I'm sure you can do it overseas as well. - Excuse me sir. - Wait. I'll see you later. Go get Singapore for me son. - Yes. - Sir, you've been waiting for this. - Get me that. - Okay. ADX can offer quality and affordability. We go for volume in terms of sales. Actually, I have here the prototype. We can launch this anytime. The only thing I am waiting for is the production... And of course, everyone's approval. Mico, I told you this many times before. We should be aiming for more innovative features? Technology requires high production cost. There's premium to it. That is the reason why people are buying it. Not because we' re cheap. Then why do you think the sales of Velocity Max is not picking up yet? Obviously, the bad economy is affecting our sales. Could it be that our shoes are too expensive? It's expensive because it's worth that much. I think Mico is right. The market research report says it too. You have a copy of this right? I've asked you several times if this report has arrived. And you keep saying it hasn't. But, ifs been with you for along time. You should have told me earlier so we could still do something about it. I didn't want to tell you because I knew you'll act like this. I reminded you right from the start! You better control your expenses because you are way over the budget. You told me to bet on those shoes. Like all your past lines. I did it. I did, why? Because I trusted you. Yet you managed to do this to me. We still have a pending batch in production, am I right? Cancel it! - Stop the production of Velocity Max. - What? There's no need for that. What about the deal with Singapore? Tatang, believe me, I can handle this. You're so obsessed with your shoes. You can't think straight. Take a step back. You can use Mice's help. And talk about the best way you can solve this. Look, I'm in charge of product development, not Mico. I'm still training him and he's not ready, believe me. Tatang, I know he's your nephew But I'm saying I can do these myself. Are you trying to tell me something Eugene? You should take a break. Calm down. Before saying anything else. Fine, I'll take a break. - Hi Cam! - Why did you buy that again? - The other one is expensive. - That's how it is. - Scrooge! - This is fine. - Hi babe! - Thank you! Thank you. Hey, Mr. Cirvero! What are you doing here? I bet you broke up with your girlfriend. What girlfriend? Those shoes! They' re your girlfriend! You've been in a relationship with your work ever since after college. Well if this is my girlfriend, she is so ungrateful! You're so bitter! So stupid, I mean they can't appreciate a good shoe. Then, there must be really something wrong with your shoes, right? What? What I'm trying to say is that... You and your "girlfriend" are living in a bubble. Why don't you try going out and try to see her in a different perspective? Or better yet, find a new girlfriend! The real kind of girlfriend. So ifs not all work for you, right? No one's good enough. Wow, you think you're all that! - it's true. - Wow! Ok, if you don't want to look for a girlfriend... Then try to go on a vacation. Go somewhere far away so you can distract yourself from work. They have to realize what they're losing. Let's go on a vacation! My treat. - What about our sales? - I'll pay for it. Let's do the zipline! What? You didn't ask permission? - You're on AWOL? - That's right! - Aren't they gonna look for you? - That's their problem. I have a feeling you're playing hard to get. I'm just trying to make a point. I brought the company to the top and now this? Without me, I bet they'll be in big trouble. - They need me. - You see! You are playing hard to get. You think you're so important. - How do you stand her? - How can we stand you? So in demand! So loved! Sir Euge, there's something I want to consult to you. Sir Euge, can I call you? It's important. Sir Euge, Tatang is looking for you. I'm sorry, I am on vacation. Let's go! Can you take our picture? Just one, please. Okay, one, two, three! One more time! Sir, is this the longest one? Yes, it's 840 meters. - Okay, let's do that one! - Ouch! Ma'am, Sir, please don't forget to follow the instructions. We're ready. - Three, two, one, take off. - Wait! Wait! Again? Let them go first. Two people can go there. Couple, couple! - That's us! - That would be us! Sorry Euge, he said it's for couples. Thank you. Ok, please give me the instructions. Are we launching at the same time? Hey, I designed those shoes. But that's an old model. If you want a new pair I can give you one. You're the girl who was in a daze? We ran into each other the other day, remember? You really don't remember me? - I can really do it this time. - Yes ma'am! Are you sure? Let's tie it properly. I can do this. Are you ready? - I can do this! - Of course you can! Go after her! It's fun right? Hold on to it, man. So what? Did you enjoy it? Ma'am, please hold tight. Okay, pull it. Please hold on to it. Let's do it again! That's for pushing me. But thanks. Thanks! Yes! Well, at least you'll remember me now. Hi! I'm Cam, your new best friend. That was awesome! No one's ever done that to Eugene! - Raffy. - Are you here with your friends? What are your activities? - I haven't decided yet. - But, do you have plans today? - None. - Why don't you join us? We're doing a lot of death defying stuff! - I might be imposing. - Of course not! Just come with us. She's going to be quite a challenge. Have you tried the ATV? We' re going there later. Excuse me. Raffy, let's go! I don't know why you are acting that way You like her? She looks hot! You're avoiding me Don't you know it hurts me But I just want you to know That I love you I'm serious Just smile at me, and I'll be in heaven Can you still do it? I love you I'm serious Please say something except, "I don't know" You're too slow. Ls that the best you can do? I hope you stop Saying you don't know and that I'm not serious Annoying! How come you're clueless That saying you don't know also means yes - I love you, I'm serious - One more time! Jump! - Can you do this? - Just smile at me and I'll be in heaven - Sausage? - I love you, I'm serious. - No, no, thank you. - Vegetarian Please say something except, "I don't know" You know what? You're just trying to impress her. I'm sure they can hear you all the way there. - Eugene is flirting with her! - Of course not! You're not scared. Stop! Enough already! - I love you, I'm serious - So, are you scared again? Just smile at me and I'll be in heaven - I love you, I'm serious - Wait! Wait! - Please say something except... - You can do it! I can't do it anymore! - I can't do it anymore! - ..."I don't know" it's your fault. - Are you OK? - Yes. Let's do it again? - except, "I don't know" - Let's go? Nice one! - Hey, I want that one! - Let's go! Let's go! This is exciting! I bet you can't do that. I told you. Stop distracting me! Faster! Go Raffy! She's gonna fall! You're almost there. - Two more steps - A little bit more. You're too slow. I'll go ahead. You're gonna fall! It's as simple as that. It's your turn. Hurry up! Go Raffy! You're too slow. One step at a time, Raffy. Come on! Oops! Take it easy! That's it! You can do it! Like what I've said, one step at a time. What the heck, you're still holding on to it. Euge. That's the best you can do? Stop it Euge! She's scared! She can do it! She's just pretending to be scared. Let go! Let it go! That's it. Walk slowly. You really are scared, aren't you? Yes. Grab my hand. I can do this. I will do this. Okay, just do it slowly. Okay. One step at a time. That's it. - Go Raffy! - You can do it! There you go! You're almost there. Hurray! Good job!

Let's fix this already. This is the best day ever! Thanks to me! Yes, thank you! Where in the world is Raffy? She probably got flushed in the toilet. Or she might have gone through the back door and ran off. Raffy wouldn't do that. That's right! 'Coz you're the mighty Euge. So gorgeous! We'll go ahead! You think you're the only one that has plans? Us too! Tell Raffy we waited for her. All my life Without a doubt I give you All my life Now and forever till the day I die You and I will share All the things These changing world can offer So I sing I'd be happy just to stay this way Spend each day with you There was a time That I'd just thought that I would loose my mind You came along and then the sun did shine We started on our way I do recall that every moment spend was wasted time Sing some more! But then I chose to lay it on the line - Go ahead and sing! - Ha? - You were singing, right? - No, I was just doing drums. No way, I heard you! Come on! Come on! No. What? Don't tell me you're shy. You're actually good. You're even better than the guy singing over there. Come on! No. Ok. Just to be fair, you can ask me to do anything as long as you sing. - Anything? - Yes, anything! Hurry! But, you better sing! Ok. Stop that guy from singing. When I just thought that I would lose my mind You came along and then the sun did shine You're gonna sing, right? - It started on our way - You better promise! What you're asking me to do is not easy. - I do recall". - You wait there. That every moment spent was wasted time But then I chose to lay it on the line I want it all my life Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Sir wait a minute sir, that's enough. - Sorry. - I'm not. - You're so mean. - I didn't turn it off. Hold on! Just a minute. I'm tired. I want to sit. I can't believe that I'm with the person who designed my favorite shoes. Yeah right! These really are my favorite shoes. My dad gave them to me. Just look at how used the soles are. It has so much scars. Check this out, it tore up when I tried climbing a tree. And this one got tangled in the bicycle. We've been through a lot. You know what, shoes are the least appreciated things in this world. Huh? Come to think of it, we just step on them. They get all the dirt from trying to protect our feet. Imagine all the crap and nails they've stepped on. They even have to endure the mud when it rains. So, it only means, that they carry all the burden for us. They just take it all in, 'coz they are shoes. That's how they love us. And so, I wanna thank you. - For what? - For my shoes. Be! Be! Be! What? Dude, you look happy! Did something happen? I'm a loser. What? Eugene Cirvero, a loser? Why are you so happy then? I don't know. I'm going to bed now I have an early day tomorrow Dear, where are you? Please call me now Are you okay? Cuz, where are you? Classmate, I'm just here. Dear, please tell me you're OK. Good morning, sir. Good morning. - Raffy! - Euge! Are you there already? - You're too early. - Am I early or are you late? Ok, l' m late. I'll be right there. I'm coming. Hey, we might not be able to see Tinago Falls. Coming! Welcome to Tinago falls. We conquer 434 steps. Okay. - Can you do it? - Game! One, two, three, four, five... Ninety seven, ninety eight, ninety nine, one hundred... One hundred one, one hundred two... Hey Raffy, tired already? No. 304, 305, 306, 307, 308... 418, 419, 420... It's so beautiful! Wow! Never thought it could be this beautiful. Me too. Let's see who can jump in first! Let's go! Hurry up! You're so slow! - I'm so excited! - Me too! - Let's go! - Ok, I'll go ahead. Ok, Ok... one, two... - You cheated! - Hey! I won! W0ohooh!!! Yeah!!!

Okay. I bet the foreigners left already. - So, is that a yes? - Yes. - Yes. - Good! Raffy? Raffy? Sir, she already checked out. - Are you sure? - Yes, sir. Eugene, what's taking you so long? - We'll go ahead. - I'm coming. Hey! Why didn't you invite Raffy today? It's going to be fun today. She'll miss it. Maybe she came into her senses. And couldn't stand him anymore. Hey, it's Raffy! It is Raffy! - Driver. - Sir. Please lead the car to that girl. There she is. Please stop the car! Hey! Raffy, Raffy, where did you come from? - I just went to the restroom. - Where are you headed to? - Cagayan de Oro. - Are you going river rafting? - Yes. - That's where we' re going. Why don't you join us? - Come on, let's go! - Really? He's been having a bad day. Hope you can change his mood. - Come on, sit down. - Hello. - Let's go! - Let's go! Euge, I'm so sorry I couldn't go last night. It's okay. I couldn't go either. I had to work. What is it this time, Melinda? Sir, could you please send it later? Sir Mico needs to be given a copy. What? For what? Melinda, you better be honest with me. Sir, there was a telecon with Singapore. It was Sir Mico who talked to them. What? Why Mico? Why him? Euge. Mico, am I hearing it right? Why are you talking to RF? That's way out of your league. That's my project, my job! I had to make a call Euge. You weren't here and somebody had to talk to them. And it had to be you. Uncle Ricky and I decided to deal with it asap. They were asking for updates Euge. They were asking how Velocity Max is doing locally. - If it was selling. - And what did you say? I told them that we' re having challenges but we are doing something about it. So, you implied that there's a problem with my shoes! How would a company distribute the shoes internationally... With an answer like that huh? You know what Mico? You're not making any sense! Didn't you learn anything from me? I really can't leave you guys out there. You guys just can't do things right without me! Hold it right there Euge, I told them that we are dealing with it. They're still going to wait for the report this month. Plus, they' re bound to find out the truth. I'm sure they're doing their own background check... If the shoes are really selling or not. There is nothing wrong with my shoes! You gave them a wrong answer! Your strategy was wrong! Shit! Euge, calm down. You don't get to tell me what to do. Okay? Okay guys, we will work as a team, okay? When we are about to hit the big boarder ahead what will you do? - High five. - Very good. Every time we come to rapids we do... - High five! - High five! Let's go, come on. This is Raffy's first time! Wow! - Are you OK? - Okay. - Forward guys go. - Forward. One, two... - High five! - High five! Stop paddling. Have you guys ever fallen here? Euge? Move forward guys. Stop! Euge! He told us to stop! Forward. Okay, stop, stop. Euge! He told us to stop! Euge, take it easy! We are approaching the technical section of this rapids, okay. Always listen and obey my commands. Okay stop! Stop! Banker stop. Go! Go! - Left turn! - Right, right turn. No left, left turn. Euge left turn. - Right turn. - Left turn. - Raffy! - Raffy! Swimmer! Swimmer! Help me get the paddles. Raffy! Hey! - Are you OK? - I'm Ok. We can take you home using the car... Since our flight is not until later in the evening. Don't worry, I'm fine. it's out of the way. You take care of yourself, OK? I can take the jeepney. I'll just wait here. I'm so glad to have met you and Tupe. Euge, you can do everything right? Ls saying sorry not a part of it? Hey, I'm sorry. Raf, hey Raffy stop! Raffy, I already said I'm sorry! Look, I was angry a while ago. I was just so mad because look, I gave them everything. Even my entire life to that project... Only to be taken for granted just because of one mistake. No, it hasn't even failed yet. And... I was the one who almost died earlier right? Then why is this all about you, you, you! Your problems are so petty! Petty ? Do you know how I feel? Do you know how it feels to be me right now, huh? Do you have any idea how it feels like to wake up one day... And the people who used to believe in you say that you're no longer great. You know what, I built that company! I brought that to where it is right now. And then now what? I'm being left out! Do you have any idea how that feels? Whoever said that you should take on everyone's problems? You know what? You can be angry all you want... Throw a fit, and lose control of yourself... But, it wont change anything. All those things will eventually be taken away from you. Because everything ends. And your work, ifs not your life. - it's not everything, Euge. - It is. For me it is. If I lose that job, what happens to me then? I will be nothing! So don't tell me ifs not everything. Because you don't know what ifs like. Like what? Like you've been robbed of something? Like you've been cheated? You feel like you've been a good person. You've followed all the rules. And yet, you still lose in the end. It's like you've been beaten up. You're suffering and in pain all the time. Ls that what it's like? My God! You are so lucky! Be thankful that you're still capable of feeling something. That those feelings are still there. Because it only means that you are still alive. Shit! I'd give up everything, just to stay alive. Raffy, what are you talking about? What I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't take your life for granted. You have to believe... That you're worth more than your company or your shoes, Euge. Because to me, you will always mean so much. You taught me how to be brave. Then, why are you walking away from me? I like you. I like you a lot. That's what scares me. Why? I'm afraid that if I don't walk away now, I'll fall in love with you. And what's so wrong with that? L' m dying, Euge. I have stage 4 Lymphoma. It's back for the third time. I try not to fall in love with you but I think I already have. Now, tell me, can you love someone knowing that you'll lose her in the end? I thought so. Don't you have any news yet? I'll call you again. Mom? Where have you been? What has gotten into you? You just left without telling anyone. You've become so irresponsible! Do you even think about those who worry about you? We've spent sleepless nights. We have no idea where or what you've been up to. We don't know if you've been eating or getting enough sleep... If you're tired, or if you've been taking your medications! - Ellen... I... It seems like she hasn't been listening to what the doctor told her. You're doing things that you're not supposed to! Raffy, let me remind you that your illness... Has already spread in your intestines and bone marrow. Ellen, do you honestly think she'll forget that when she's the one dying? For years, she has been suffering. For years, she has been obedient to us. It's about time that we give her the time she wants for herself. What you're asking me to do is not easy. It's difficult to be left behind. You know that it's not easy for me too. But I also know, that it is not easy for your daughter too. Mom? I was so worried about you. - Sorry. - I was so scared. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Don't worry, we will go and see your doctor again. I will have your chemo scheduled. Give it up mom. I've had enough. It will only give us false hopes. I am so tired. I just want to make the most out of my remaining days with you and dad. - ls this everything I need? - Yes, sir. Ok. Let me know right away once the ADX prototype has arrived. Okay sir. We also need to have it shipped to Singapore as soon as possible. Yes, Sir Mico. Hello? Ok, I'll do it. We have to do it right away. - Okay, sir. - Thank you. I'm on it. Bye. Good morning, sir! Mico, what happened to the... I have been trying to call you but your cellphone's been switched off. I understand the frustration, but, AWOL? It almost cost us Singapore. I was disappointed, Eugene. I expected more from you. What do you want me to do? You tell me. Well, it seems like I'm no longer needed here. So are you letting go of this project? Shall I assign it solely to Mico? Come on. We're about to start. Let's go. I'll come back for you here. Let's go. Hey Raffy! Come over here for a moment. Ok, just a minute. There you go. Ok. So, how are you? I'm Ok. Everything's still the same. Nothing has changed. Work? Among other things. You know... This is the first time in my life I actually don't know what to do. You know part of me just... Just wants to give up and quit. Maybe my feet brought me here. You might know how to handle situations like this. I mean you seem to know more. What would you do Raffy? What would you do if you were me? Well, if I were as brave and as brilliant as you... And if my future was as bright as yours, I wouldn't give up. I wouldn't take the cowardly route and give up, I'd fight! If you really love what you're doing... And you can still do something about it, why will you give up? You know, what if they're right? You know, what if I ended up disappointing them more? You know, what if I've become a nobody to them? I can't take this anymore. That's not like you. Hold on. You just stay put. You know what? It may be expensive but ifs worth it. - Raffy! - Hey Steff! Euge, this is Steff. She's my best friend in everything! Steff, meet Euge. - Hi. - This is Euge. You're so handsome! How was your check-up? Can I borrow her for a moment? Hey Raffy! I'm really glad to see you. Me too. Raffy? Can I see you again? Yes. You should've tried the zipline. It's like you're really flying! - You really did that? - Yes. - Aren't you scared of heights? - I've become brave now. That's right. She did everything! Zipline, zorb ball, whitewater rafting. She's really brave now. Wow! That's really good Raffy! Euge, if you were able to let Raffy do all those things... Maybe you can also convince her to go back to her doctor and seek treatment. - Mom, cake? - I'll go get it. Let me do it, mom. it's just cake. - I can go get it. - Why don't you just sit down? Mom, let me do it. - Mom! - it's just chocolate cake. Is this the one? Good morning. Surprise! What are you guys doing out there? My best friend, why didn't you tell me about it? Tell you what? I... - Tupe? - I told them. - Euge! Please don't cry. Look! I'm still alive! How can you even joke about it? No wonder you did all these things for me. - ls this my wake? - You're crazy! - Raffy? What do you see? - Euge! I'm serious, what do you see? Come on, tell me. I look happy here, and trying to look sweet here. I look so scared in that one. I look so alive. And now, I want you to see the things that you can still do. One, two, three. Raffy, I dare you to give it another try. Get the treatment. - Euge! - Raffy? You said that you should fight for things that are important to you. You're the one who told me to keep on fighting. And I'm willing to go on now. I want you to do the same. Raffy. Raffy, you're a lot braver than you think. You're even braver than I am. Raffy, imagine if you do this. You can stop counting sunsets and look forward to more sunrises. I'll make sure you wake up every morning. I promise you'll live. I'll even wake you up everyday. I'll be with you all the way. Raffy, I'm going back to work. And I'm not giving up just as you asked me. But I'll only do it, if you promise me you won't give up on you too. How can I say no to that? - Hello ? - Wake up call! - Good morning! - Good morning! I have to finish this for my chemo, right? Yes! Sir, I respect your decision to send Mice's shoes to Singapore. But I hope that you give me one more chance to fight for my shoe. Tatang please, last chance. Eugene, before I give you another chance... I think you should talk to your staff first. He's right! You should apologize to your staff... Because you left them without saying a word. Hurry! Hurry! He's waiting. They' re here. I'm sorry. I left without saying a word. Can I have another chance? - Good morning. - Good morning. Are you pooping? We need new ideas on how to sell the shoes. Sir, we need a new tagline. Sorry sir. No, no you're right! What do you think? Anyone? You're worth it? I got that from you. Another one. You need this. You're beginning to look like Kim Chui. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Big day today. - Yeah. You don't have to stay. I wanna be here. I'm still alive, Euge. Good morning! You have my yes, Euge. I am presenting both shoes to RF International. Good job guys! Euge, may the best shoe win. Surprise! I'm so proud of you! Hey, ifs just me. Hey, you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. I'm so flattered. Ooops sorry! Do you remember when you asked me... If I could love someone knowing that I'll only lose her in the end? Now, I know the answer. It's a no! Because I will not lose her. - I love you. - Love you. You better be ready for me when you get better. Good morning! Wake up call! Euge! It hurts! Where? It really, really hurts! Sir! It will be over soon so just relax, OK? What is it? She was the same way when the cancer came back the second time. It's as if her whole body was beaten up. Even her skin feels sore. What can we do? Don't worry! She's taking her pain reliever. It will take effect in just a while. What else can we do? Nothing, we just have to wait. - Come with me. - Yes, doctor. Eugene we can try all of that and some other options. But there is no guarantee she will get better. She will get better. Eugene, even medical specialist... In fact, medical science, there are limitations. There's not much we can do. What I'm telling you Eugene is we cannot save her She cannot be saved anymore. Letting her go is not an option. I prefer the last presentation. What do you think? We choose ADX! - Yes! - Yes! That's mine. Thank you very much. Congrats! Congrats! Good job! - Congratulations. - Congratulations to you too! Congratulations Mico! Sir. Thank you! Euge, that's life. You can't win all the time. Raffy? We should always be happy, and find joy in everything. To her, being happy is what life is all about. She was a good daughter, sister, and friend. There's one in Seattle and in New York. I need to talk to your doctor tomorrow. And here's one in Singapore... I can feel that my body can no longer take the chemo. - I am so tired. - Look, we have to believe. We have to believe it will work, okay? - We can't give up. - What if it doesn't work? Are you going to argue with my doctors too? Are you going to be angry again? Be bitter with your life again? And be mad at me? My shoe lost, fine! I don't care! My Dad thinks I'm a fool. I can take that! All the races, I can lose them. But you? I can't lose you. Not you! I want to hear your eulogy for me. Raffy. Come on. It's useless if I don't hear it now, right? - No! - Euge, that's where I'm headed for. The sooner you accept that, the better for all of us. For you it is! But not for me! Not for your mom. Nor your dad! Not for those you're leaving behind! Don't give up on us! Because we're not giving up on you! Don't leave us! Raffy... Raffy, I love you! Loving me doesn't mean that I won't be dying soon. I'm sorry for that truth. Forgive me for giving up. Just do this for me. I'm sorry if I can't give my heart to you anymore.. I'm sorry if I can't live long enough to love you. Please, Euge. Let go. I can't do it! Yes, you can. I can't! You have to let me go. Stop Eugene! Stop! It's okay to stop once in a while. Are you in pain? I think ifs your heart that's in pain. I'm okay with that. It only means that it's still working. Dad, Mom, thank you very, very much! Thank you for loving me. I love you, my baby. I love you. What does she want you to do? If I stop, it means I'm giving up on her. Ls that so? Maybe it's time for you to stop fighting your own battle and join hers. Tatang, I never knew that losing would be this hard. This is my most painful loss. Because it is here that you will gain most, son. What is there to gain? One day, you'll know the answer. I love her Tatang. And that is why you have to love her more than you possibly can. More than all your greatest fears. That is what she's asking from you. That she can go knowing that you can make it without her. Lord, can I do this? Ls there anything Eugene Cirvero, can't do? I believe in you, son. I believe in you. Thank you, Tatang. Thank you. - So sweet! - Wow! Am I allowed to have that, mom? That's not for you. That's for your Dad. Raffy? It was just supposed to be an ordinary day. I was having the worst week of my life. I never thought that, that day, the best possible thing could happen. I met her. And I fell in love. It took me just one day to fall in love with her. I just never thought it would take me forever to say goodbye. And how do you say goodbye to somebody you love? She gave me reason to wake up every morning. A reason to be thankful for each day that ends. She changed me. You know before I met her, I thought I was already everything. But now, I finally feel I'm something. Because she loved me. She taught me how to love. And she showed me that sometimes to love is to let go. And I love her that much. But I'm now willing to let her go. Raffy, I love you. And I will go on loving you even though I know that I'm going to lose you. Thank you. Thank you for coming into my life. You know, maybe we don't really say goodbye. Maybe ifs, till we meet again? I know I'll see you again one day. And when that happens, it will be forever. Forever starts today... with you. Give us the courage to change the things we can. And the humility to accept the things that we can't. Raffy's life may be short, but it was beautiful. A life well lived. Alright. Raffy! Drama queen! Tatang was right. What I thought was my most painful loss, Gave me my greatest gain. In loving her, I gained a new heart. A heart that is stronger. A heart that is bigger. A heart that will keep on living to tell her story... Our story. A story of hope, love of a day, and of forever. Euge... It's time to let her go. Till we meet again. I love you.
