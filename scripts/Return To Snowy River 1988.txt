From Snowy River? That's him... a long way from home. I'll look after him. Thanks, son. You were cracking on the pace, Jim. You goin' back for good? Yep. I been away long enough. I suppose so, but still, you'll be missed in these parts. Thanks, mate. Well, I've got my stake together now. Not a bad one, either. They're the best I've seen... for thousands of miles. You gonna breed them? Eventually. Before I left home, I let that wild stallion and his mob loose. I'll let him cover these mares. Big plans. Spare me that, mate. Was it Denny that ran down that stallion, Mr. Craig? Jim. Yep, that's him, all right. About due for a rest, I reckon. Remember Harrison? He had a daughter, didn't he? Jessica. Right. Right. That's as good a reason as any for going home in a hurry. Ha ha ha ha! - Ha ha ha! - Ha ha ha! What are you after, Seb? Rabbits... or something bigger? Depends. I thought I'd come and see if the place was all right. Thanks. Why the rifle? A few funny things have been happening. Like what? Cattle and horses spooked. They reckon we've been party-dodgin'. Stealing cattle? Surely not. No more than usual. Only what you can eat. Right. It's traditional. Those big knobs below want a bit of our grazing. They've been serving us papers. Legal papers? I don't know. I found use for them. Ha ha ha! Someone took a shot at your old stallion. What? He's all right. Who was it? Could have been anyone who's blamed him for every horse gone missing. That's just about everybody. He's not exactly housetrained, is he? Anyway, you're back for a while. Back for good, Seb. Just one more thing to do. I hope things go the way you want them to down there. Let's get a fire going. Glad you're home. Simmons! Jessica... Mr. Simmons tells me you've been riding that colt again. I employ a jockey to do that. I know, but I get faster times. Is that true? Where is this great jockey you begged me to hire? Trying to lose weight. He gets fat off me, then I pay to lighten his carcass. I want that colt flying by this weekend. These are my home grounds. I intend to win that race. That's all. Get that jockey into condition. Lousy weather. Ahh... old and cold, Jess. Old and cold. I want you to change into something more feminine before lunch. We have guests. Who? Patton. I should have guessed. Percentages, balance sheets, and interest rates make such fascinating conversation. His son will be there. Good. Alistair should liven things up a bit. And when you're running this place, you'll be glad for these business meetings, lady. Me... run the place? I thought I had to snare somebody eligible so he can run it, or think he does. Like I do, right? And listen, Jess, wear plenty of frills. If we're going to keep this place growing, we're going to need Mr. Patton and his loans. [Neigh] G'day, Denny. You have a rest, old mate. Time to teach one of these youngsters a thing or two, eh? Well, this is a first-class turnout. Does you credit. Thanks, Patton. I was talking to some others. We're impressed. We must see more of you. I'll drink to that. I can get my own glass. See to Mr. Patton's glass. Once the bank has decided to back you... and I'm sure my directors will... great things are possible. Well, I'm looking forward to it. If our ties extended beyond mortgages, I would say the sky's the limit. It's an interesting proposition, Patton, but that's up toJessica. Of course. Oh, excuse me. Colonel Hawker. Someone I'd like you to meet. Harrison, Colonel Hawker, Indian Army. Pleased to meet you. Hello. Colonel Hawker comes from India every year and buys the best cavalry horses. His, of course. Despite the poor season, I can still give you 500. Excuse me. You, look after the gentlemen. Interesting man. Has he been here long? more or less. Don't know a lot about him. Yankee originally. Made some money gold digging. Not exactly a first-class background. Not like us, eh? No, indeed. Your family came from the Percys on the Scottish border. Most certainly did. Mine were the Monraths. My lot used to hang your lot... as cattle thieves. This, Mr. Simmons, is the problem. Jessica. You want the horse to win? Let the jockey handle it. Where is our fat jockey this morning? Um, he took some medicine, so he had to go to... He should stay there. Ah, Miss Harrison. Mr. Patton, hello. Excuse me. Ahem. Charming girl. She has a mind of her own. It's the highest stepping fillies that make the best mares, eh? Mr. Harrison. Father. Come on, Harrison. This is going to be worth watching. Ladies and gentlemen... the Regimental Trophy holder, Lieutenant Patton, will now demonstrate the skill-at-arms course. Ya! That's the way! I'm awfully sorry. It's all right. You missed. Are you looking for the stables? No. Jessica Harrison. Have you seen her? Well, yes, but... who would be asking for her? That was good riding out there. My name's Jim Craig. The one we've heard about? Could be. You were lucky that day. Mainly old stages there, I hear. Everyone was invited. You're out of your class here. Sir. Mr. Collins. Good afternoon, sir. Harry Hawker. Jim Craig. Will starters and riders move onto the track? Could you spare me a minute, Jim? I noticed your horse. I was coming over for a closer look. He's a good type... learning quickly. Just the one? No. I've got about 100 of them. Really? Will you excuse me, Harry? It was good to meet you. And you. Where the devil is Summer Cloud? Already out there. A bit overanxious? Not a good sign. I wouldn't fuss about that. My Highland Laddie has got the edge on your fellow. That's easy to say, Patton. I've got 100 to back that up. Done. Come on! What is that jockey doing? It's moving. Come on! Come on! Come on! You lost. Thank you, Patton. Good horse, that. Yeah, I know. I broke him in. - Ooh! - Ooh! What are you doing out there? The jockey was missing. You just happened to be available. Simmons! Where is that bloody jockey? Here. Somebody locked me in the outhouse. Simmons... you're sacked. You're both sacked. Working for you two is like being caught in a meat grinder. I want you to go in the house and change... right now. Jess... congratulations. Thanks. Hello, Jess. Well, Craig... it's been a long time. G'day, Mr. Harrison. I don't recall having invited you today. No. I came to seeJessica. I could come back tomorrow. Well, you're not welcome here, Craig... today, tomorrow, anytime. Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you still speak forJessica, too? I don't argue with drifters. Father, please. Come with me, Jess. Jessie... I know it's been a long time, but I've got a start for us. You've been thinking of me, then? That's good. Jess. Jessica. I know you Hicks are slow on the uptake, but you're setting a record. I don't know who you think you are, but you're not part of this. You've been away too long. You don't know who's part of what. Change your clothes, Jess. Get off this property... now. There are better ways to make your point. Ya! Giddy-up! You'd call that a live prisoner. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! It was more than a loutish display. It was contempt for our values. We must get rid of that riffraff and acquire the grazing areas for the valley. It's easier said than done. Don't be too sure. I will have a bill before the house. In view of our undertakings, I can count on your support? You're saying I support you or I have bank problems. Right, Patton? It's a fraction bold, but I see you get the general drift. Ha ha ha ha! Oh! Blimey! You're enough to make a saint swear! There's no saints here. Otherwise, you can do the loaves-and-fishes thing with pounds! Miserable sinners! When you come to confession, you'll laugh on the other side of your faces. When that's finished, we'll be too old to sin! Either get on about your business or contribute to God's work with labor or cash. You must be new around here. Been away. There used to be only a small mine here. Yes, a fellow named Spur grubbed his life away here. After he died, they found it, Found what? The mother lode, A pity they don't dig as deep into their pockets. Jim! G'day, Seb. Come and have a beer. G'day, Mrs. Darcy. Hello, Sebastian. This is Jim Craig. Hello. It didn't go well down there? I didn't think they'd put out the red carpet. It was like a red rag to a bull. We know they'd like to run us out. What are the boys doing about that? Nothing. If you don't stir the possum, it won't bite you. What can we do? [Plays Piano] I'm glad to hear you're playing again. It's been too long. Do you think maybe you could play some other tune? It's not a tune. It's a sonata. Whatever the hell it is! If you're pining for that drifter Craig, you're just wasting your time. Jim isn't a drifter. The man disappears into the mountains for months. No one sees or hears from him. Whatever he is, he won't be back here, Jess. Now, I thought you accepted that. Ahh. You haven't been outside this house in days. Everyone's been asking for you. Oh! I thought this is where you wanted me, looking decorative, waiting for suitors to call. One has called... Alistair Patton... and I'm running out of excuses. Then tell him I don't want to see him. That's fine, either way. You both treated Jim disgracefully. I am sick ofJim Craig! Well, I am not! He could never belong here. You do. And so does Alistair Patton. Affections are related to property, no? You are aggravating! A chip off the old block! I don't care about the Pattons! Neither do I! What are we arguing about? Jim? Morning. Are you leaving today? No... not yet. I want to check a friend's affairs. Spur? I bet he's still smiling away to himself up there. How's that? He willed this place to fossickers around these hills. That's not playing the game by the rules. None of these people work for bosses. The Gentry can't digest that. Well, long live Eureka Creek! Heh heh. Excuse me. I came to talk to you. Couldn't believe it when I saw you again. It was like an illusion. I want to know why you were away for so long. To get a start for us. Why is accumulating things so important? Because I've seen the lack of it. I don't want that for you. Things change. Is there someone else? They've made plans for me with Alistair Patton. I'm not going through with it... but I can't come up here with you. Why not? My father. He needs me now more than he ever did before. The Pattons are the most powerful family in the district. If we were together, they would break him. Then they'd come after everybody here. Your people would turn against you because of me. You're taking too much on yourself, Jess. No. I've given this a lot of thought. It would drive us apart, Jim. Dear father, I had to seeJim. Don't be angry with me. I must do this my way. Are you just letting her go? Do you mind if I ask why? For a lot of reasons. Oh, really? It's better this way. For whom, Jake? You just say it straight out? Better for your own interests. And better for Harrison's own selfish interests, no doubt, you've been told. Just leave things as they are. Broaden your minds. Have another beer. Have two! Hah! Hah! I won't let you go. Jim. We're not messing up our lives doing what others think is right. You've thought of me, your father, almost everyone else. All right... but what about you? What do you want? I want you. You two can head back. Let's go home, Jess. Time's past for that, Harrison. Let's talk straight. Are you coming with me? Father, please, don't do this. You can't have it both ways this time. Either come with me now... or stay with him. Understand I love you both. It's me or him, Jess. It doesn't have to be a choice. Jess? I want to be with Jim. All right. All right, stay with him, then. You're just like your mother. All right, Jack. Heh heh. Havin' a good time, love? Well, look who's here. Well, here's the bloody silver spoon again. What did daddy give you for Christmas this year? A healthy dislike for dimwits. A shout for the bar. - Yay! - Yay! What do you want? What have you got? Everything. Well, I'll start with a rum... and see where we go from there. Where have you been? Don't worry about it. Just concentrate on what you know best. Haven't seen you around for a while. I better buy a drink. I could triple that roll for you. We can count on about There are 8 good fillies. Harry! They're very good. Are they for sale? We'll keep most for breeding. I supply large numbers of remounts every year, regardless of conditions. That's why I deal with people like the Pattons. They turn off guaranteed numbers. So you're not interested in small lots? Put bluntly, it's not worth my while. What if we're not talking about small lots? How about 100 a year? Every family here can turn off half a dozen horses in a year. I'm looking for quality, not stock horses. The mountain horse is bred for quality. You'll need cooperation. People here go their own way. You needn't worry. Jim's good at getting people to see things his way. All right. I'll be back in a week. If you show me the numbers, we'll talk contracts. Right. Hey, there! Giddy-up, there! Whoa! Block them up here. Hold them. Right-o. That brown horse, Charlie. And, uh... the tall bay mare there should do. You certainly go for the best. That's what I promised him. Drop them off at the new yards. All together, there's 74. Right. We'll go to Bryce's now. Come on, darlin', if you fall asleep there, I'll never move you. I never would've believed I could feel so tired and so happy at once. Take it a bit easier. All my life, I've been judged by who I am. Up here it's just what I am that matters. You've always had that. You know how good it feels. You've earned it. I'll keep earning it. [Neighing] Did you know Craig is trying to undercut us with Hawker? Not afraid of competition, are we? He's slimy. They're eating out of his hand. That's the first time you've complimented him. If you call it that. Who'd want to lead the hairy unwashed? It's time we paid him a visit. Why? Let him know we're serious. People like that should not be allowed to stand in the way of progress. Have you spoken to your father about this? I don't have to. A nod's as good as a wink. We're all looking for action, right? Yes! This is stupid, and it's wrong. Worse, it'll bounce back on you. Ask him about his real motive. LikeJessica Harrison. Shut up, Collins. Yellow-streak Collins. Gutless. If that's the way you want it, I'm waiting. I'll save my energies for Craig. Ha ha ha! See you at the debutante's ball. Ha ha ha! Yes, sir! Ha ha ha! Whoa! What is it? I heard something. Settle them down. There's nothing here. Ah ha! Ha ha ha! Oh! Ha ha! Very funny. Ha ha ha! Well, come on, let's go. Oh! Ugh! We've already lost two hours of light. Did you hear about last night? No. Alistair Patton and his mob of mates ran into that stallion of yours. Oh, yeah? Young McKay was killed. We'll talk to you alone. We'll both hear what you have to say. You were warned this might happen. What? Bringing her up here. McKay's death is a consequence. How do you figure that? It was bound to happen. Now those rich mongrels will beat us with it. You put it all on Jessica? That's not right, and you know it. We're being mindful of our families. She should go back to where she belongs! We're staying here! Well, it's your problem, and you fix it on your own. And you shoot that stallion... or I will. I liked Jim McKay. He had such a happy... Don't, Jess. And now he's dead. You mustn't blame yourself. Can't you see? It's turned out exactly as I said it would. No. It's got nothing to do with us. They made their own decisions. Will you stop telling me we're not responsible for our decisions! If you hadn't stopped me going home, this wouldn't have happened! I'll be back in a while, all right? [Nickers] [Neigh] [Nickers] [Neigh] [Neigh] [Neigh] [Neigh] Do you want to earn some money? Depends. Yours... when they're over the border. Worth a fortune. Settling a score, are we? Does it matter? I prefer straight-out business. If we start immediately, we can't fail. I'll need a tithing to convince the boys. You could buy them for a beer. But... to show you. Done. How far? About 10 minutes. Jess? She's not here, mate. Where is she? I don't know. The place was empty. Where you off to? To find her. Where? Back down, I think. In case I'm wrong, will you stay here? Sure. Thanks. See you. Help me, Harrison. Why don't you go to the police? That's what they're for. I don't want the police in this. You know the country up there. I want you to bring Alistair back. You mean you want me to stop him from doing something stupid. Bring Alistair back, and your loan goes straight through. How is it every conversation with you turns to money? This wouldn't have happened if you controlled your daughter. It's notJessica who's rampaging like some spoiled child. Your daughter is responsible for Alistair's state of mind. She lied to him, led him on, played the coquette with him. You know, you're a very lucky man. Not so long ago, you'd be dead right now. But I'm going to make allowances because of the worry your son's caused you. [Crash] My daughter's been the only honest person in this whole affair. We're the ones who tried to twist every advantage out of it. And now, I've been patient enough with you, Mr. Patton. Here's your loan application... and there's the door. You're finished with the bank. Ha ha ha! Ooh! That's a different story altogether. I must love you. Couldn't get any further than Eureka Creek. Hah! Someone get a doctor! Seb! Are you all right? Nothing horsehair and gum sapling won't fix. What happened? They were driving away your horses. They just ran straight over me. Who? I recognized Alistair Patton. There's a mob of them. Get him inside! Ohh. Now do we start to fight them? The scores are even. One of theirs for one of ours. That's your own son! I'm talking about all our women and kids. Oh, no! He can't go alone. Come on, Den. Need you for this one. All right. Come on, Den. Hss! Giddup! Tell them to ease up a bit. Nobody's going to trouble us out here. Hah! Hss! Come on! Go! Giddup! Come on! That's it! Whoa! Back! That's Craig. He's outsmarted himself up there. There's no way down. Don't forget who he is. Hah! Hah! Ooh! Aah! Ooh! You killed him. Maybe. I'm going to make sure. No bloody fear! Let's get out of it! Ohh. Mmm. Mmm. Oh, no. Not you. Oh, what have I done? Ohh. I'm so sorry... my poor old friend. Aah! Get back! Go on! Get back! Hold on, big man. Wait. Yeah, you know me, don't you? Now... I need your help. That's it. I'm not going to hurt you. Just stand. That's it. I'm going to touch you now. Come on, you wild old thing. Good. Good man. Whoa. Whoa. Have a look at this. Have a look at it. Just have a look at it. Come on. It's all right. Ooh! Steady! Steady! Steady, now. Steady. Just stand. All right. Aah! Uh! Get back here, you. Easy, boy. Easy. Well, let's go! Right! - Hah! - Hah! Hah! Woo! That's it! Right. Heh heh heh. Come on. Hurry up. [Whips Crack] Hey! Hey! Get! Get going! [Whips Crack] They're on to us! There he is! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Down river! Ha ha ha! Yeah! Woo! Right! Split up! We'll get round in front of them. Hss! Let's get out of here! Get around them! Get in there, lads! Patton! Patton! Look out! Ooh! Ya! Hah! Hah! Ya! Aah! Ya! Ya! Aah! Aah! Oooh. It's all right. All right. Uh! You're the best, old man. You should be free. Off you go. [Neigh] It's all right now, Jess. Ohh, thank God. Well, I really missed you, Jess. I missed you, too. I was wrong... and I was stupid. I'm sorry. Never heard you say that before. But you're here. You're both here. Nothing else matters.
