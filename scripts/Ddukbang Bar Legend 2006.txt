Why the fuck are they beating up that kid? Well, it must've felt awesome. Hey, It really sucks. Let's live brighter days. It would be bright with you out of my life. We really were awesome then. You taking care of 3 and me doing the same on 18. If you beat 18 guys at once, then what does that make Jeong-gwon? Jeong-gwon? I miss Jeong-gwon. PARK Jeong-gwon, what are you up to these days? You fuckers! Look at 'em blocking the road, I'm so scared! Where can I pass through? Fuck, I can't pass through! He's got the look of a killer, how can I pass him? These sons of bitches are all fucking scared shit. Let's just go. Losers! Why block the road? Move over so we can pass through. We're busy, okay? Since when did you start to come around here? With a stern look on your face, no less! Fuckers, just go away when we are easy on you. Bingo, the fuckface is out in full force. No wonder his swearing makes him the worst kind. What a foul mouth this kid's got, son of bitch. Let's just go. Yeah, let's go. To the ditch! Shut your filthy mouth, fucking bastards! You're in deep shit today, get ready to die. Idiot Fuckers! Finish what you started, coward! Come here, you fuck. I'm going to kill you. You fucking son of bitch. Come here you motherfucker. I said, come here you son of bitch. Let go of me, you fuck! - Let go of my arm! Three Fellas Let go of my arm! Come here you motherfucker. We are the Water Mill Clan. Today's the day you get your asses kicked! You fucking son of bitch. Come on! Three Fellas Fucking cowards, come on, show me what you got! Lunch period was a working period to put the student body under control. We were... Jeong-gwon and I, to be specific Have done a lifetime's worth of fighting then. Jeong-gwon enjoyed the fighting. His goal was to be the fist of the school. I didn't care much for fighting. Having nothing to do, I fought along with him. He was my friend. Oh yeah, Gyeong-ro. He's our buddy. Not sure how we became pals. He's good guy though. Come back here, you sons of bitches! Jeong-gwon. Jeong-gwon. Gyeong-ro! Get up, you fuck! Gyeong-ro claims Jeong-gwon had the entire school under his fist. I believed him, coming from a buddy of mine. What? Nothing. Just asking, why did you become the main fist? Know when to ask such question. Ask him about existence and you will never get an answer. Don't you know? Why did I become one? What are you gonna do now? Good question... What the hell are you guys saying? Gotta keep our turf under control. Our turf, you say? I meant school. School is your turf? It's for the principal. That's true... Why the negative outlook? You miserable fuck. Seriously, what now? Should've thought it over before being the fist. Maybe I will go to a military school. Forget it, no standoffs there. They send out their bodyguards instead. Hey, fuckers. How are you, boss? You guys are here again? Like cockroaches, only coming out at night. Drinking your youth away. Bitches... Keep it cool and don't do anything foolish. Goodbye boss! Have a nice day. Doesn't he look awesome or what? He doesn't look older than us. You're crazy. Any Ditch Clan member is a boss. I came up with what I should do. The Ditch! We're gonna take The Ditch! The Ditch Clan. Jeong-gwon wants to destroy it. Is that possible? Could be interesting... We are gonna rule The Ditch. Those fuckers are too tough, brother. Since the seniors have graduated We will just dissolve the Water Mill Clan And make up something new. Don't bother, just let it be Water Mill Clan. Gotta change the name, to celebrate the destruction of the Ditch Clan! How about The Misfits? Make it sound somewhat academic. - It's an academic clan then. - Like that, but more intense- Intense... No Touch Clan! No Touch? Is that even grammatically correct? Shouldn't it be 'Don't Touch Clan' instead? Isn't that too awkward? - What is too awkward? - 'Don't' is. It's got a point mark in the middle too. That's apostrophe. And T is silent. Too complicated. Let's go with 'No Touch.' - And 'No Touch' is not? - No. No Touch it is, then. - Okay, No Touch Clan. - No! Touch! Clan! Okay, No Touch, yeah! Nothing but 'No Touch'! - Sounds good. - Sounds fantastic. Brothers! We will do anything for you! No Touch Clan... goes on one cue. Water Mill Clan's out of the school ground now? Water Mill folded. It's No Touch now... You miserable sons of bitches! And you, take out your ID. How much older are you? I said how old are you Sang-soo, you fuck! Take the ID out yourself, son of bitch! Screw them! Let go of me! Get lost bitches! Fuckers! Come here, you fuck! The Ditch Clan doesn't know Gyeong-ro's yapping has no control. Upon getting a blow to the head Gyeong-ro can no longer think with his brain. He does it with his mouth. My leg got beaten badly! It hurts whenever it rains. Jeong-gwon, however had no signs of any injuries And single-handedly destroy The Ditch Clan. Get your head bashed and feel what it's like! You fuckers all around! This fucker is the same age as we are. Stop talking. Hurts my brain. The Ditch is ours from now on! # Couldn't get my head up # in the morning, # afraid my scar will be shown # Have you been to school? # Was everything alright? # Dark clouds are # in pursuit of me everyday I liked the ditch. Everything became well. I was living a poetic life. Gyeong-ro just kept on singing. That was the beginning of Gyeong-ro. Although the ditch became his turf Jeong-gwon remained silent I was afraid of his silence. We graduated from high school It felt like being expelled, however. Upon graduation, Jeong-gwon left for a larger clan hoping to become a respectable gangster. Where to? Really leaving? Why? For what? We sent Jeong-gwon away. Time passed. The Ditch without Jeong-gwon meant the obvious It once again became the Ditch Clan's turf. But we stayed put. Without Jeong-gwon We didn't have Jeong-gwon It was just two of us. Promised each other not to be lonely. # Blossomed with showering of love # Our hearts united together # at first glance # Will always be there for each other, # forever Upon serving as a part-timer at Karaoke Gyeong-ro became popular among the housewives And became the professional singing partner. He was the first-ever Male singing companion-for-hire. One, two, one, two, three, four! # My heart is choking # and I open my window Geong-ro evolved eventually Met his mentor in life, ending the life of red-light district I felt rather sorry for him. Mom told me to learn some skills What did she know? Learning skills were more difficult. Skills... That's not for everyone to learn. Studying was the easiest thing for me to do. I studied really hard and went to college. Pre-med, School of Radiology at the community college. Glad that I'm buying you a lunch? Sure, I will probably be constipated. Shithead, thanks for the compliment. Ramen noodles for lunch and you're bragging? - Aren't you leaving? - I should. Hey, you! What's wrong? What's wrong? You should answer with 'yes sir'! You guys are really pitiful. What a fucker, really... Do I look nothing to you? Do I look soft to you, huh? Shit, I'm late. You take care of these, Seong-hyeon. Relax... It's going to enter now. Please relax. Pardon me... but, um... Everything's okay, just a little longer. Doctor, You're not... It'll be over soon. I think it's in the wrong place... It went in well... No, that's not what I meant... You idiot! Where did you put the endoscope? - Rectum. - Take it out now, you fucking idiot! Good afternoon. Welcome to my awesome vocal class.

You think I'm crazy? Doing things as you say? I'm so fucking pissed. In the past... when we fought... You never sought your opponent, Seong-hyeon. And only looked after Gyeong-ro, right? - Yeah. - Why? When I fight, I end up looking for you. Since you get beat up so bad. Shit, that's just the plan. Me taking care of 5 or 6 guys and you guys facing off the rest, fuckers. Having someone like me around is the reason you guys are smiling and being happy. For such brittle-hearted guys like you an artist like me must protect you to avoid you from becoming emotionless and stay human. Did my best and what do I get? No recognition whatsoever! I'm serious, I'm not talking to you. No more friendly gestures, I'm really pissed. Also, I threw tons of punches, you fucker, really. I don't know how much you... Never mind. Don't mention it. Everything's taken care of. - Yeah? - Of course. We took them to the police. What could they do about it? They agreed on moving out in a month, just for their moving expenses. Only a few days left. Get ready for forced demolition. Yes, boss. You saw that, right? You saw that fucking Sang-soo put in his place. Yeah, I saw it. You see this patching on my head? Where? Oh my god, yeah. We once had a standoff with the Ditch Clan with Sang-soo as their leader. And going 107 against 7. Who's 7? Of course it was us, the No Touch Clan. I got hit with steel pipe here. The steel pipe just like, bam! And got stuck to my skull. So what did you do? Just put my strength on it and it wouldn't come out. Put my strength on the head and the steel pipe just stuck there. That fucker was so horrified. That's awesome. How incredible. You're so incredible. I'm gonna get my neighborhood back. The preparation is over. I wanna hug you. Jeong-soon, my head hurts. Nice... it feels so nice. Did you stab your torso again? Stop doing that, huh? Aren't you too old for that stuff? Where's your pride, aren't you ashamed? LEE Chi-su, a fucking son of bitch. I'm gonna cut him in half. What are gonna do after that? Sang-choon Clan. Isn't finished yet. Heard Jeong-gwon went to jail while protecting you. I will look for him as well. Jeong-gwon... PARK Jeong-gwon... LEE Chi-su... - You sure it's LEE Chi-su? - Yes, boss. Said he will take you out. Others have joined him too. Where are you heading now? Where should we go? Stop the car. Boss. Stop it. Why keep going when there's no place to go? What are you gonna do? Jeong-gwon? Did you just say, PARK Jeong-gwon? Yes, boss. I'm really sorry. Boss, is that PARK Jeong-gwon... - Do you know him? - I know him well. That son of bitch... Does that fucker live here? Yes, boss. Actually... he's the No Touch Clan. And... I'm getting squeezed by him. If you can deal with him a bit I will take care of the rest... I was rotting in jail for two fucking years because of him. PARK Jeong-gwon... PARK Jeong-gwon... - Don't move! Stay put! - Fucking cops. Put your hands up! Let me go, you fuck! Removal began taking place here. All the contracts are signed on this region. This spot is the problem though. This is where the entry road will be placed just an area of It's a difficult place to get. Just 13.2 sq. meters? Even the builders are fed up. The owner flat out refuses to sell. What the fuck! Who the fuck is the owner? He lived there for over 30 years. The name is YOO Byeong-cheol. YOO Byeong-cheol? YOO Byeong-cheol? Do you know him? Huh? That's not him... I've heard that name before, it sounds familiar... Are you eating well? Yes, don't worry, I'm fine. Body strength is the national strength, so eat well. Don't smoke either. You take care of yourself, dad. Don't worry about me, I'm good at taking care of me. - What's so funny? - Nothing, I'm just smiling. Aren't you going to police station? I'm thinking about taking a day off. Don't worry too much. I'm gonna make lots of money and bring them to you. Don't worry about your father. Dad! Huh? I love you. Shit. Yeah, I love you too. But Korea is an independent nation. This means you have to be independent also. Huh? I'm gonna leave this place soon. Why? Did you find a woman? No need to know everything. I bet you did... you did. I slept with her. When did that happen? The day I met her. I couldn't do that... Be a mogul, or grow up into gang boss. It's all the same once you're successful. This Oseong guy is really something else. Have you stabbed someone with a knife like that? Something like that. Oh, fantastic! So, how does this work? Jeong-gwon is like Oseong. Seong-hyeon's like LIM Chang-jeong character. That leaves me with JEONG Woo-seong, the hero! Woo-seong is something else! Search the place thoroughly! You promised to buy us a drink! - Come on, treat us. - Get some rest. PARK Jeong-gwon. A cute bastard. This fucker is the one, the legend in this neighborhood. That's what we hear, boss. Bastard looks like one. Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are YOU? Shit... I'm your... I'm your daddy, you filthy fuck! You all look like shit. What a bunch of losers... Hey, shithead! Fucking son of bitch! Fucking bastard! Get that fucker! Jeong-gwon, where are you? Please leave this place, boss. - Why, who's the problem? - It's Chi-su. LEE Chi-su. - Chi-su? Why? - First, get out of here boss. The cops will be here soon. Why would the cops be here? That's not important now. You must escape quickly. What the hell is up with my clan? What the hell, where is he? Something's strange, boss. Sir, come on. Now I'm... Sons of bitches, go to the police station and talk! - You fuckers! - Sons of bitches! Bastards! I'm calling my lawyer. Let go of me, fuckers. Let go! What's up with 5 minutes! It took 15 minutes instead. They must've got beaten so bad. Hey! What did you say before? Said I'm your daddy, you filthy son of bitch. You wanna die, little shit? Where the hell is Jeong-gwon? How should I know? Officer KIM, where's the back up? On their way now. Put that cigarette out, come on. Which fucker's causing the trouble? Dad! Stay out of this, son. Are you the one? - Who the hell are you? - Who the hell are you? Me? I'm YOO Byeong-cheol, the original Water Mill Clan! YOO Byeong-cheol? The land guy...? Are you the one? Time for a legend to arise again! You, come over here. My god, like father like son... You come out too, chief. All of you sons of bitches, follow me and come on out! - Which fucker pulled the signal? - Why? You again? Yeah, whatcha gonna do about it, you fucking shit? Quit your nice job at the hospital... Going through puberty again? Stop troubling others, come on! Do you even feel troubled by it? Of course it does. We've been together for several years. Do you even care about me? Told you to move out, why don't you move out? Keep saying that and I will leave for sure. Do you want me to leave? Should I leave? Why are you so quiet? I'm leaving... Fine, leave! That's enough, Gyeong-ro. What is? Whatever. What do you mean? Nothing... Aren't you too old to be acting crazy and do everything as you wish? You said that was my appeal. Does it change time to time? Everyone's fucking comic now? You endure, escape, go back and lose... You're old enough to feel comfortable in such ways. Are you a chicken lady turned philosopher or something? That's what I'm saying. I'm going to bed. Leave the dishes in the sink when you're done. Don't come near me... Don't stab me. I'm calling from Yeoksam-dong. I'm at Midomi Seafood Restaurant. Sang-choon Clan and Rotary Clan... Please hurry... Where'd you get the cellphone? It's Gitaek's. Good for you. Those bastards were really scary. It was fucking hilarious. We got beat up and begged for the settlements to pay. The ones that beat us up refused to settle, and would rather go to jail. Every fucking time... I haven't done anything wrong and this is what happens. Was it scary? Really scary. Nothing like the Ditch? The world... is full of strong sons of bitches. The ones who beat the strong... are the rich ones. And the ones who beat the rich... are the ones with nothing at all. What do you mean? LEE Chi-su... that bastard has no parents, friends or home. Probably no nostalgia either. Such a pitiful fucker. Really pitiful fucker. You guys... This is not the time to say this But remember these words! The police... ...are just 5 minutes away from us. Won't be more than Some more drinks? I don't drink. Is there anything that you need for me to get you? No. Bro, should I take you home? Will you leave by yourself instead? The traitor will be sought until the end and eliminated. Come on. Just leave. I can't just leave. Hey bro, Have I hurt Boss Sang-choon in any way? I went directly to jail for 2 years before released. I know. Jeong-gwon stopped you. That fucker didn't stop a shit! Brothers Yoon-gyu, Hyeon-cheol, they all went to jail. All we have left in the mob are some henchmen, thanks to you fuck! I hunted this fucker down, trying to save his own life. What happened then? Calling cops during the fight? Never in the history of mob! Saved your ass from getting arrested! Just go home... you fucking greenhorn... Die LEE Chi-su, you son of bitch... I'm taking charge of the Sang-choon Clan. Anyone who's not confident, leave right now. Is it OK? Take charge when the boss is the only one left. Sang-choon or whoever, just kill them all! Detective KIM! LEE Chi-su is on his way now. Yes, to the office. Sang-choon clan's office. Boss, get out now! I don't care about Jeong-gwon. Think you will win? - It seems hopeless. - What the hell is this then? Protecting the clan's honor. Come and get me. You come and get me, bro. Hey! Stop it already! Where did you sleep? I see... I get it. Shut your eyes, you sons of bitches! Fucking bastards! Sons of bitches! Fucking bastards, you fuckers! Challenge me? You fucking shitheads! Fuck! You fucking shit! Sons of bitches, did you just look at me? You fucking bastard! What are you looking at, you fuckface! It took some time for me as well. Convincing myself as a 3rd rate thug... It took a long time. Yoon-gyu. Being a head gangster is harder than getting into the top university. Chance of becoming a boss is harder than becoming a prosecutor. Let's just live by percentages from now on! You laughing at me now? Hungry? You ignoring me now? Stop stabbing your belly. You're too old for that. It's really childish, you know? Hey, fuckface. What the fuck? You fucking bastard! Come here, you son of bitch! The ditch will be gone. So say goodbye to your fucking ditch you son of a bitch! Hand over your land now. You fuckers are really bold, you know that? When you fuckers were little Mr. Shin and I had tons of standoffs, you sons of bitches! Pay up for damaging my table! Take it out. See, you scratched it! Put your hand up, you fuck. Put it up. How did you manage to rule with such lack of confidence? You miserable piece of shit... I'm not gonna fight anymore. I'm gonna leave this place. I have no interest in this shit neighborhood. So... Put your hand up. Let's just stop, please. Put it up. You fucking son of bitch! Hey, fuckface! - Fucking sons of bitches... - You son of bitch! It's an unfortunate destiny for you. Why do you live like that, fucking idiot? Should've just pulled some standoffs at the ditch, why did you climb out of there and make it tiresome for many people? I know your type well. Acting like you're the boss. What a fucking loser... Let's hurry up and finish it. Put your hand up. If I ever see you again... you're dead. Brother! It's me, PARK Jeong-gwon! Give him a tea, at least. Have a nice life. Let me ask you one thing. What did you ever do to land yourself in jail? Hi, Seong-hyeon. Hi... It's been awhile. The settlement went fine. Still taking care of your resignation... Haven't got to look into your severance pay... It's not gonna be much. Um, you know... Why, what now? I'M BACK! # Oh no, don't behave this way. # Oh no, don't behave this way. Cut in staccato, in wily fashion. # Woman is as fickle as a reed # Woman is as fickle as a reed # No, stop it. Don't ask. # You mustn't expect anything # more from me. Try this. - What is it? - A cocktail. - What's it called? - Orgasm. Seong-hyeon. So woman can have a fling once in her life. Aren't you being too persistent over it? Really. Do you even know how men feel? Why did you come back then? I'm starting over with a new job and new mind. Come here for second... Promise you will never cheat on me again? I promise. Why didn't you come to my vocal class? Didn't know you started again. I did. Okay. I will be there tomorrow. - Jeong-soon. - What? Can I live here? What about your dad? He told me to leave. - How come? - Told me to be independent. - New woman in his life? - I guess so. He will re-marry and live happily ever after. So... can I live here with you? Okay, if you wish. Thanks a lot Jeong-soon. You're burning it! Oh man, what's this, all of sudden... I haven't seen Jeong-gwon for 2 weeks or so. Well, to be exact, I didn't see him on purpose. We could no longer pass by Orgasm Bar. Had to go through the back alley. Didn't go near the Ditch under any circumstances. Construction for apartment complex began. Improvement works on the ditch began also. The neighborhood was changing. Come to think of it, Everyone and everything were changing except for myself, Gyeong-ro, Jeong-gwon And my friends... we were the only ones unaware of it. I was hoping, in a cowardly, shameful way that Jeong-gwon would leave our neighborhood soon, when... that became the time I was changing the most since my birth. Real estate dealing contract Read it thoroughly. Actually, don't even bother. I'm paying you five times its value. I won't sell it. Even if someone kills me with an axe. No way I'm gonna sell it at that price. How much do you want for your land? Take him outside. Yes, boss. Huh? Let go of me! Let me go! Let go of me, you fuckers! Really, you fuckers, assholes... Stop spreading my legs like that! I'm gonna call my fellas and beat the crap out of you... Ouch! Okay, fine. You little bitches! Let's get it on. You ugly fucking sons of bitches. Are you senile, you fuck! Come on, all of you. Bring it on, you pubic hairs! Go bury him alive. Yes boss. Don't come near me. Stop it, right there. Don't make me kill you. Hey, you fucking sons of bitches! Are you still here, you son of bitch? Hey junior, what's up? How'd you know I was here? Shit, I was about to kill some people. I'm leaving now! It's me... I'm leaving... Before I do, let me ask you a favor as a friend. Bring all the fellas to the ditch. Jeong-soon, I will see you later. The police are just 5 minutes away from us. Won't be more than 15 minutes, at worst. We had a 5 year-period gap. However the late... The 15 minutes will narrow down that gap. Didn't I tell you I would kill you if you return? The Ditch! We are taking charge of it. Told you it will no longer be there. We will be in charge regardless! Because I'm PARK Jeong-gwon of No Touch Clan! Let's go, charge! Where's the youth without the legend? life is like that. Sometimes you do something that is nonsense with a predictable outcome But it has to be done. This is the time for such thing. We will probably end up losing. But it's unavoidable. Once our legend disappears we are left with no signs of nostalgia And head to unfamiliar territory of life. We will be so pitiful. Once you get pushed, it's over. Once you get pushed, it all disappears. It may sound amusing, but We want to be the men with nostalgia... about this ditch, about the legend of the ditch and all springy nostalgic memories... So the Ditch Clan was absorbed by LEE Chi-su Clan? - You said they were the same clan. - I didn't say that. It was AHN Sang-soo from the Ditch Clan who brought in fucking LEE Chi-su And this Chi-su fuck took everything including Ditch Clan. That's fucking tense. But you said No Touch Clan took care of LEE Chi-su Clan. Right... during the No Touch Clan's sweeping victory at The Ditch. You've heard of it, right? The legendary 18 on 1 standoff by PARK Jeong-gwon! His right hand man Gi Seong-hyeon's blow knocking out three at once! However, the most important one being the mysterious legend of Wait a minute... isn't it common sense That someone with 19 on 1 fight be the leader? Exactly. So the real boss of No Touch Clan was YOO Gyeong-ro. In the end, PARK Jeong-gwon was just a scarecrow-type following the orders from YOO Gyeong-ro. Once Mr. YOO came to The Ditch, it was like a Tsunami passing by. No wonder his nickname was Yoo-unami! Welcome to awesome vocal class with YOO Gyeong-ro and No Touch! Let's go! # Goodbye my love # Remember gazing at the stars at night # and promising # our never-changing love? # Have you forgotten it? # Were you just playing with me? # Is love like that? - # It comes here and there - # It comes - # It goes here and there - # It goes! Guys, it really sucks. - What now? - What? Nothing's wrong with our stuff. Yet he keeps on nagging, saying stuff smells like pesticides! So? The owner there sure is picky. That fucker is younger than me and still talks down! What are you gonna do? What should we do? Maybe I should flex my muscle a bit. Should I beat the crap out of him? You know my temper... fuck. Members from LEE Chi-su gang have been released. Some members of Sang-choon Clan are out too. Those fuckers. They are all determined to get me. Come on, just for one year. Go to military service then, shithead! - I'm exempt. - Stabbed with a knife? Hardship of living! Oh shit. How come you always end up like this, huh? That's what I'm saying. It is a bit awkward speaking as a police. For crimes with one year jail sentence... there's simple assault, fraud and larceny... Don't go there. Choose the one... ...that's a kinder type of crime. You asshole! There's no such thing as a kind crime!
