"Give me pain..and relief too." "Bless me with courage." "O Lord..bless me with your grace." "..and unite me with my desires." "Unite me." Mister, can I be of some service? You know no one buys your bread. Please lease this place to my brother. At least we'll get some rent. Again you mentioned about your brother. I don't want to sell this bakery. I'm fed-up of you and your bakery. No need to go out and work. Why do you keep talking about it all the time? What else do you want? We should continue living like this? We have only one son. And he's turning into one of us. - What's this nonsense? Always on the guitar. I am tired of listening to it. What are you doing? - The bakery's isn't doing well.. ...and your mother keeps arguing with me. "All my refuge are lonely." "l couldn't get a moment of relief." "My loneliness follows me around like a shadow. O Lord..""" "O Lord.." "Either you make me..or break me." "l'm Your devotee..you decide." "O Lord..bless me with your grace." "..and unite me with my desires." "Unite me." 'Some people run after dreams..' '..because they want to fulfill it.' 'But some people run after dreams..' '..because they're running from their reality.' 'And you want to stan all over again far away.' 'So far..where there are no traces of your past life.' 'And while doing that.' '..you don't realize whether you're doing wrong or right.' 'You simply run away..' '..from your parents.' My hean has been stolen, what do I do now? Yeah.. Yes. Mr. Dhingra. Come, come..sit. - Good morning. How is it? How is it? It really hit me hard. What? - Nice, sir. It's really nice. It's bound to be nice. You see..Pappi Singh is not a singer. I keep saying the same thing. He's a brand. - You're right, sir. If a underwear seller doesn't have a catchy name for his product. ...no one's going to wear his underwear. These days even underwear has catchy names. "Petrol..Diesel..CNG!" Like you're wearing an entire petrol pump. Correct. Correct. Take my advice..and turn yourself into some brand. - Right. I've heard your voice. It's filled with emotions. I'm giving you a chance because you're talented. Arrange for the money..and we'll stan work. Money? You'll be investing the money, boy, not me. I only give my label. King Audio! Get the money and we'll start. Go on..go! Just a minute. - It's okay. Hi, Ronny. Hi, Nimmi. Where were you from four days? Two maninis. Remember what happened the last time. ...when you had two together? You won't have to carry me today. I am here with someone. Where did you find this nutcase? Mom-dad found him. ...for my marriage! He lives in Australia. And he's rich. Good! Good? Do you realize..l am marrying him next week Can you imagine that? Next week? Hello..you're not jealous at all? What kind of guy is this man, like seriously! Look, I've told you before. - I know. You don't believe in marriages. you'll never get married.. ...you want to concentrate on your careerblah-blah. Thank you very much for reminding me that. You're welcome. You know what, I am leaving. You can keep your non-commitment. ...no-relation, no-marriage attitude to yourself. And sleep with this guitar each night. Cheers. I ordered that drink for my would-be husband. Sorry, my mistake. It's not a mistake, lnder. It's a sign. My dreams..my desires. ...will come true. Nimmi..Be Positive, The SecreLLinda Goodman.. Reading these books are not going to help you. Marriage is a horrible thing. But..it's your life, do whatever you want. Just go to hell, lnder. Hey..Nimmi! Hello. Good day, mister. Myself, Advocate Kanar Singh Chima from Kasoli. Yes? Well, actually I wanted to give you a small trouble. Your dear father, the very respected Mr. Bhajanlal Bhalla.. ...Is tired of working hard..and wants to retire. It's his life, he can do anything he likes with it. Wonderful! What a great son Mr. Bhalla has. Super! But the problem is that the bakery.. ...Is on your ancestral land. And your grandfather willed this land.. ...to you and your father. So? So the point is you'll have to come down to India once. Once you sign on the Bakery papers.. ...your father can take his share and rest easy. And you can take your share and have a ball. Right. He's very stubborn. He won't come. He will never come. I am stubbormand he's flexible like rubber band. Look, I am not interested. You can give him my share too. What are you doing? Fortune's ready to smile on you.. ...and you want to wash your face. Leave for India tomorrow. No one's lending us money anyway. L..can't go to India. What's the problem in going there once? It's been 10 years since I left home.. Earlier I would talk to my mother. But I haven't talked to her either for the past few years. You know..you don't have to see your father. Just go home..take your share..and back to pavilion! I knew it. I knew you can't live without me. I knew you would come to the airpon to stop me. Let me guess. Nimmi..please don't go..and all that. Enough, Nimmi. I am going to India for some official work. Wow..what will you call it now? Coincidence..or sign? Look, lnder. We decided we'll never meet again. And I never told you that I am going to India. So? You will call-off my wedding, I know it. But on a serious note, lnder.. Don't make me elope with you.. ...when I'm decked up in the bridal dress and jewelry. It'll be really difficult to run.. What say? Inder? Inder? Son, an Indian always helps another Indian. Will you help me? - Of course, aunty. Your uncle and I got separate seats. And between us.. we've only one denture. Where is it? No, no..no.! Uncle? - He's right there. What happened? Well..you see aunty.. ...an Indian doesn't always help another Indian. Goodnight! Inder! lnder! Look what I brought. My son's a graduate now. He has completed his graduation. Inder, come down. Let's put up this board. I don't want to work in your bakery. What kind of a son is he! He refused to work at the bakery! What is it, Mr. Bhalla? Did he disappoint you? What do you want to do? What do you want to do in life? I don't want to live in this country. I want to go abroad. What's he saying? He sounds like those people are waiting for you.. With a Welcome' board. Ronnie's papa is letting him go, what's your problem? He's going to Bangkok. Your friend Randeep's going really far. We'll have to begin from somewhere. But. I told you he doesn't want to give me money. Why don't you give him the money? Fine..shake that tree outside. And take all the money that falls from it. You weren't born with a silver-spoon! Then what are you for? Why give binh to me in the first place? Look son..take my advice. We'll run the bakery together. All you do is squat flies all day at the bakery. I want to do something with my life..l want to be someone. You sound as if we haven't done anything with our lives. Yes..you've done a lot. You're good for nothing. Son.. - Loser! What are you doing? How dare you argue with your father! Have you ever acted like a father? Did you ever ask me what I want, what I thought? Every father is a hero for his child. The child is always assured.. ...that no matter what, his father's there. But you are my problem! I see.. Fine, I am your problem. Get out of my house. And don't come back.. ...until you don't make something of yourself. Get out! What are you saying? - Be quiet. Inder, stop. What are you doing, son? Didn't I tell you, mom.. ...someday he'll throw me out just like my guitar. - No. Let me go, mom. - Stop..lnder! Nimmi. Nimmi, did you board the plane? - Board? The plane's already landed, papa. Land? You were supposed to arrive at 8pm, but landed at 8am instead? You're too much, papa. You blundered again. Stay there, I'll send a car to the airport. Get the car. If you send a car now, we'll be wasting a lot of time. It's okay. - I'll take a taxi. But. - It's okay, papa. Okay, bye. She has arrived. Since you're here, why don't you attend my wedding as well? You sing well. If you perform at my ceremonies, you can make some money as well. Come on. Your hean might melt..when you see me in the bridal dress. Goodbye..Ms. Nimmi! May your wedding be a pleasant one! You go your way, and I go my way. "O companiomjust a little longer." The destination of love's calling out to thee. Gurdaspur. - Kasoli. Why are you after me? Chill. I'll take another cab. No, no, sir. Gurdaspur is on the way. We can drop her on the way and continue to Kasoli. You see..this way I'll get two fares. "You're the one..l prayed for." Taking a single step without you..is impossible. Madam..your stop is here. Lefs go. - 0K8'!- "O companiomjust a little longer." The destination of love's calling out to thee. Well..you're on a suicide path. So..good luck. Please fulfill my last wish before I die. How about you give me a biscuit from your bakery? You know..it's a four hour journey. And I'll even take your parents' blessings. Blessings? Once you meet them. ...It will shatter all your illusions about marriage. Most welcome. Come. - Sir..are you lnder Bhalla? Foreign return? Yes. You see..your father is at the lawyer's place. And he's called you there too. And the lawyer has even sent a car for you. Come. Sister-in-law, you too. "Oh my baby doll of gold..." You're a bloody good for nothing, loser. Get out of my house. Get out. Advocate Chima. Welcome, mister. Welcome. Welcome, lnder. Come. Come, sit. Take a seat. Don't be shy. Sister-in-law is with you too. Come on. Sit down. See, Mr. Bhalla, finally they are here. Sign here..and make your father sign here. What's this? - What's this? It's an invitation to my tonsuring ceremony. What a joke. These are the papers to your father's bakery. Your father borrowed a huge sum from me. And now I've to borrow money from other people. Your father's borrowed money from everyone in the village. Even ATM machines refuse to give him money. Look..l've a complete list. 2 million..with interest. 2 million. Give me the Bakery..scores settled. I came here to take my share of the money. Exactly. I put out a bait and you came running. Had he been getting his share.. ...he would've been overwhelmed. Your father's left you debt as inheritance. So you will have to pay up. Sign on the papers..and make your father sign as well. His sign doesn't matter. I am not going to sign in the first place. Bloody old man.. Chima, my home's above the bakery. If I sell it, where will I live? Your son's come down from abroad. He'll take you back with him. He won't take me anywhere. And I won't go with him either. Son.. him? You see..you two have one day. I'll come home..to taste sister-in-laws cooking. Either you pay my 2 million..or give me the bakery. And if you don't settle this account tomorrow.. "Then I'll put you two in your bakery's furnace. ...and make bread. Careful..you fool. Careful. Even/thing's still the same. Same old broken roads. Same old din and filth..same old people. Look there. That dog's been peeing there for the last 10 years. At least he's loyal. He's lazy, not loyal. He's stuck at the same place for 10 years. I would be rotting here too. Yes, of course. He's the only one who's been successful. That's why he came down for his share. Nonsense. Tell him..there are no goons after me. 2 million in debts. What was the reason to borrow so much money? And even if he did.. People always keep aside some savings. I did do some savings. I did too. I kept giving that money to his mother. And his mother used to make jewelry out of it.. ...so that it'll come in handy someday. Tell him that. Ask him..where's the jewelry? Did he put them in the oven and make biscuits? Tell him..his mother kept all the jewelry at his uncle's place. Because she didn't trust me. Ask him..why doesn't he tell mother to get those jewelry back? I can't tell her that. Tell him, daughter-in-law. Tell him..you're not his daughter-in-law. I am not your daughter-in-law. - Fine. You're not my daughter-in-law, good for you. You should thank God for it. Stop, the bakery's here. - Fine, fine. Will you take us to the border? Come on. How much? - 3550 rupees. What? - Yes, sir. He hasn't paid my fare for the last 5 years. Put it on my tab. No more nonsense from you. Come on. What a man. - l'll.. Uncle, let me take that. - It's alright, dear. Come on. Yes, papa? Dear, it's almost evening..and you're not home yet. Yes, I'm a bit late. How late? I'll come tomorrow morning. Where will you stay? I'll stay with my friend..lnder. - lnder? Fine, dear. Okay, papa. Bye. Are you and lnder just friends, or.. - Well, l.. On, l get n. lnder's the one saying no. Hopeless boy. Come. 'Why don't you put him in some good school?' 'Why don't you understand, I don't have the kind of money..' 'Then let him stay with my brother..' 'Don't talk about your brother, or else I will beat you.' 'Don't touch me.' Don't you dare take his name. - So why don't you.. 'I'll slap you.' Do you know three-lettered word for "Aascharya, Achambit" (Astonishment). AMAZE. - Where's mother? No, not AMAZE. In Hindi. Sorry, uncle. Ask him where's mom. She's at the Old Age Home. What? She's been sick for the past couple of years.. ...so she's at the Old Age Home. - Sick? If she's sick, she should be at the hospital. Why the Old Age Home? Are you going to say something or not? There are no big hospitals here. There's just one Old Age Home.. ...where people with such conditions are treated. What "Condition"? Alzheimer's is most hereditary. At first, the patient begins to forget small things. Like namesmames of things used daily. Then slowly..she gets morose at nature. The patient doesn't realize this himself. But yes..if someone pays attention. "Then it can be detected at an early stage. It's really strange. ...that no one at your home detected these symptoms. Well..my papa and mom don't get along. And you? Isn't there a cure, doctor? Well, there is no cure. "But we can slow down the process. The patient needs to be given medicine on time. And most imponantly. ...the patient needs a good ambience. And she needs to be kept happy at every cost. Can I take mom home? Welcome, mister. Wakeup, Bhalla. Look..this time you two get straight to the point. I don't want any lengthy conversations. Did you sign or not? Why did you bring her here? Did you take the biscuits out of the oven? They will get burnt. Why did you bring her here? Don't worry. I will look after mom. You will look after her? You? Will you take her along? - Isn't that what you want? That's one burden off your shoulders. Happy? - Enough! Shut up! Shut up! You two are more like Wildcats rather than a father and son. Always fighting. The point is..your father hasn't signed yet. And I never will. Look here.. - Forget it. I won't sign. I don't want to sign. Nimmi, why don't you and mom sit outside? You cannot force me. Hey..no one's going anywhere. Sit here. Be quiet. Sit here. You're too much. Or I will shoot. What do you mean you'll shoot? Chima, listen to me. I've already signed the papers. I don't care how you'll extract the money from him. Get it. I know how. Bhalla..come on, sign. What are you doing? Lower the gun. I'm saving-- What's wrong? I've told you a thousand times..grease this thing. Never fires when you want it to. Oh god, it fired! The gun fired. Look, Chima..relax. We have some jewelry. It's not here, it's someplace else. It's with our uncle Kripal. What uncle? We've an uncle who lives close to Chandigarh. Give me his number. Hold it. - Wait, I'll give you his number. Boss. Boss..there's no balance in your phone. Okay, dial this number. You fool..-981.. You call him. Why? - Why should we call him? I won't waste any more money. What a miser! There..it's ringing. Talk to him. - What will I say? We don't get along. You talk to him. Put it on speaker. Hello. The serpent. Hello, uncle, it's lnder speaking. Inder? lnder who? Oh..Bhalla's son. Finally you called, huh! No, aunty. I called because I was missing you. You forgot all about us. And now you finally remembered about us. Get to the point. Where's uncle? Uncle's gone for a long drive. When will he return? We just bought a new Mercedes yesterday. Mercedes! That rascal Kirpal must have sold my jewels and bought the Mercedes. I know your uncle too well. I said take me along as well. After all I am your wife. Let me sit in the Mercedes as well. Fine, aunty. I am hanging up. Listen up. You two leave right now. And come back only with the jewelry. And if you don't get the jewelry, get the Mercedes instead. Wow! That's great. Thank you. - Okay, fine. Come, mom. Nimmi..l'll drop you on the way. Sit. Sit. Sit. What if the entire family disappears after getting the jewelry? You expect me to beg outside the temple for the rest of my life? Aunty and sister-in-law are going to stay with us. What? And if you miss them. Give me your phone. But. If you want to talk to your mom, just call. Go on. Let's go have a pastry. Walk faster. Isn't there a way to the bakery from inside? - Yes. Come on. You, wipe my face. I'll show you. How dare you give a bad name to Kasol! I will set you straight. Welcome, Mr. Bhalla. You could've at least spared the police. Now you want to borrow money from us as well. Have some shame. Look, I am lnder Bhalla. Chima and his goons have barged in our house. - I see.. Fine then, keep him there. The minister's visiting today. It's best he doesn't come anywhere close to him. Just entertain him in any way you can. Don't let him out. Okay. See..that's Law and Order. Foreign returned! If you have any problemsspeak out now.

Spare no expenses at the wedding. Listen..we could not do anything special at our wedding. But we'll spare no expenses at lnder's wedding. Yes, don't worry. We'll give him a grand wedding. Just rest. We'll need her medicines. Who charges for buttermilk? What are you saying? - Just joking. How much? - 50 rupees. She's here. - Nimmi. Nimmi, how are you? - Are you fine? I am okay. Papa, this is Bhalla uncle. Hello. - Hello. This is lnder. Inder? But you said Indira over the phone. Indira's his sister. - I see. Leave that..aunt's not well. Let's take her home. - Yes. Don't worry. There are three doctors at home. Three? - Ayurvedic..Homeopathic and Allopathic. We'll treat her at home. Come, come, come! Father..brother..look Nimmi's here. Come, Come. Come in. Look, brother. Nimmi's here. Look. Nimmi's back. Come, Nimmi. They are all wearing same glasses. No need to worry. I just need to inject her. And she'll be fine. Allopathy is useless. I've brought Ayurvedic powder for you. This will give you relief. You've got powder for everylhing. Powder for cold. Powder for paralysis. This powder is only good for laxative. Try this homeopathy medicine. Hey homeopathy. Give those sugarcoated pills to kids. They will suck on it. These pills are good for nothing. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Wait a minute. She's already being treated by the doctors at Sharda Old Age Home. I know the doctor at Sharda really well. I'll ask them about her condition. The rest of you come along. Let's have some dinner. Yes. Come on. Those who speak the name of god. They emerge victorious. Hurry up, hurry up. The groom's arriving tomorrow. This is the limit. You haven't decorated the car yet.

I want to just eat him up. Get on with the henna ceremony. I'll join you in a minute. Nimmi, you're so lucky. Nimmi's so fortunate. Because she's marrying such a guy, right? I always dreamed about a wedding like this. When you get married, make sure it's grand like this. Your mother always wished that we had a grand wedding. But that could never happen. We took our nuptial rounds in two pair of clothes. ...and in the presence of four family members. I brought your mom home in a rickshaw. Nor did I have the money to throw a feast. You served sugarcane juice to everyone and chucked them out. I was going to say that. - I know. I've been hearing your sob story since I was a kid. Really? Mr. Bhalla..let me introduce you. My aunt's son, Billu Gill. Greetings. - Greetings. Nimmi was saying that your daughter Indira lives abroad. Indira? Yes, she does. That's Lucky, his son. Greetings. - He wants to go abroad as well. This is great. You two talk, I'll be right back. Mr. Billu, your son's Lucky while my son's unlucky. For the past 10 years I've been telling him to go abroad. But he doesn't listen. He says..l won't leave my parents. How could I go, uncle? My love for my parents is such that. ...l can't leave them and go away. He'll only get spoilt out there. He'll be so rude.. ...that he won't stop the car even if you have to pee. No, papa..l will stop the car. I swear. Lucky..how can you stop the car.. ...when you find out that your father's borrowed money from everyone.. ...and goons are chasing you for recovery. How will you stop the car? What?

Sell the bakery and put an end to all this. And what do I do after I sell it? Sell candy-oss and gumballs outside schools. At least there's something I own. And few people still visit the place. Only a handful people come your place for years. Bajwa, Gupta, Sharma and Gulati. And you can live the rest of your life depending on them. Who else can I depend on?

Greetings. Aunt'!- lnder..you're here. You did the right thing. Your uncle's met a terrible fate. It's really terrible. He went out in his new Mercedes. But on the way..a truck driver saw him and said.. Hip-hip-hurray Mr. Arora, brand new Mercedes. And your uncle took his hand off the steering wheel.. ...and replied "Hip-hip-hurray". And smashed his new Mercedes. But is the pole okay." I mean, your uncle Kirpal. ls he okay? Can we talk to him? We haven't seen him yet, how can you? Mother. - Oh my, somethings wrong. What happened?

What the..careful. - Lord is the ultimate truth. He only looks skinny. But honestly he's heavier than a mountain. He's turned into a bull with our money. Hey..laundryman. - Move the red cloth. "Lord is the ultimate truth." Fine..fine.."Lord is the ultimate truth." Watch your step. "Lord is the ultimate truth." "Lord is the ultimate truth." Holy Cow.. Careful. Careful. - Lord is the ultimate truth. "Lord is the ultimate truth." Come back, lnder. Good catch. Uncle, return our ball. Uncle, return our ball. Uncle, return our ball. Will you take it along? What option do we have? Did you ever try to stick your hands in a crocodile's jaw.. ...and rip his heart? "Lord is the ultimate truth." He's left me all alone. My husband is dead.. He went so suddenly. He used to ride a Mercedes here. What will he be riding up there? He's made me a widow. Louder! You too. What's all this? - Where did they come from? Keep saying? He ate stuffed bread here.. What will he eat up there? Hi! Hi! Hi! Listen, Nimmi. Sorry. You'll have to wait little longer because of us. It's okay. Inder. Come here. You want this? There's the crocodile with the heart. Let's go. Inder, you're here. You made me really happy. Your uncle really loved you. He used to say lnder earns in Dollars. Listen to me, son. Your uncle had a wish.. ...that we throw a big feast for everyone. And son, we left no deanh. We made sweetmeat in organic ghee. And fritters fried in olive oil. And your uncle's left this for you. Son, I have just one request. Lend me 300,000 rupees. I'll install three benches at the station in your uncle's memory. And it will also bear your name. "NRl lnder". Here you go, son. This is for you. The bills for all the expenses. Just give me 300,000.. - Curse you, you wretch. Don't you have any shame? You want us to pay for your husband's final rites. Liar. Kirpal must have left our jewelry behind. Tell us where they are. What jewelry? What about the time when you left your mother here? Who was paying for her expenses? You left mother here? I'll tell you later. Son, your father troubled your mother so much. ...that she lost her mind. Hey drama queen! And when she lost her mind, this rascal threw her out. You're uttering nonsense. You threw mother out of the house? Don't listen to her, I'll tell you the truth. And son, we looked after your mother for a year. Hopeless woman..stop ranting. Listen to me. I am sure he never told you this. He divorced your mother, I've got proof. What are you saying? You divorced mother? What? Brother lnder! Brother lnder! What happened? Move..move back. Papa has left this key for you. What key? Show me? No..father said "Mom's a crocodile, she'll devour everylhing". Heard that, you crocodile. - You shut up. Well..don't just stand there, catch the short one. Give me the key. - Here. Chote, give me the key. Give me the key. Come and get it. - Come on.. - Stop. Here's the key. Come and get it. Stop. What are you doing? Chote, give me the key or else I'll spank you. Chote, what are you doing? Stop, Chote. Move aside. Wait. Chote.. Catch him. Brother lnder. You are all my brothers. ...so I won't raise my hand on you. But if anyone tries to stop us.. ...l'll give them a sound thrashing and.. I'll beat you up real bad. Which cupboard does this key open? This doesn't open any cupboard. It's the key to a locker in Kasol Bank. Back to Kasol? Stop the car. I said stop the car. Will you please stop the car? Stop the car. Ask. Why don't you ask..why I threw your mother out? Why did I divorce her? Ask whatever you want. There's no need to ask. I've been watching everylhing since I was a kid. And I should've realized everylhing.. ...when I saw mom at the Old Age Home the other day. She was there because she was sick. Why won't she fall sick? A woman that served you all her life, endured your taunts.. ...If you divorce her at this age, she's bound to fall sick. Look at what you've done to her. You..you're responsible for your mother's condition. Wow..that's.. Fantastic man..that's unbelievable. You just keep it up, okay. Stop showing off your English. Do you have the strength to hear the truth? Your mother had already given up on me.. ...because I was uselesshopeless. But you were the apple of her eye. My child will make me proud..look after me. "He'll suppon in my old-age." But this kid..left her all alone. I may have divorced her, but I am with her now. You did this to her. It was you. Only you! Fine..fine...! I left her, right? She's my responsibility. So now I'm taking mother back with me. You can stay here with your bakery. You think that. I have seven kids.. But you're all just a bunch of fools. Look at them. Boss, do we come along too? - Yes. Bloody beggars, have you seen your clothes? Clothes. - His uncle seems to be a rich man. I'll go alone. 0K8'!- No one will get down from the car. Fine, boss. Look at him licking ice-cream. and laughing. I'll slap you. Stupid. Greetings. - Greetings. Are you Mr. Arora, the Mercedes owner's, wife? Yes. Well..Mr. Bhalla's my uncle. So? I had an imponant message for him. He's here, isn't he? Can you call him? Well..go call Bhalla now. Okay, mom. Come on.. - Come.. You want to meet Bhalla, don't you? - Listen to me. Listen to me. This is wrong. I think the boss is getting beaten up. Come inside. Shall we go in? - Shut up. The boss said no, remember. Have you seen your clothes? Nephew's looking so handsome. Get lost. Look at the boss' clothes. Don't forget your jacket. Yeah, Ronnie. - Yeah, lnder. The bank formalities will be done with by tomorrow. - Okay. But I'll have to wait few days. ...to arrange for mom's passpon and visa. You're bringing your parents here. Not my parents..just mom. And Bhalla uncle? I just said only mom. Did you have a fight with your father again? It's not that, papa. - I don't have the time to explain all this. We were stuck. I'll be home in 3-4 hours. But what will we tell Mohit until then? Tell him I am angry with him. Just make some excuse, papa. Come soon. - Okay. If you are marrying him then tell him the truth. No need to lie. One has to make excuses, lnder. Because life has given us excuses for staying together. As you can see..first in the plane. Then we had to run away together. You even dropped me home. But Chima brought me to you again. This is some divine scheme..which will ultimately unite us. It's a fraud. Marry Mohit, he's a good boy. Come on. Brother-in-law.Brother-in-law. - I am going. Nimmi doesn't want to see you until you don't grow a moustache. Are you crazy? I can't grow a moustache so easily. Please drink some cold drink. - I don't want it. Please, have it. Did you eat? - Yes, I did. With my own hands. Wow. Congratulations. And where is he? How many times have I told to get the good stuff. This thing stings. Should l? - Yeah. I meant me..dab it on me. Boss, boss, boss..look. I think that's our car. That is our car. Go and get it. - Yeah.. And listen..be swift. Okay. - Go. You carry on. Slowly. - Carefully. Come on. RascaL. Tip-toe. Tip-toe. Bhalla, you.. Hey..let's go. Quickly. They are here already. Hey, stop. They are gone. Come quickly. Come on. - Coming. Stop tip-toeing and run. Come on. - Run! Faster. Drive faster. - Quickly. Bhalla..l got beaten up because of you. I won't spare you this time. I'm paying the installments on the car..and they're taking it for a spin. They're driving really fast. After all it's our car, boss. What are you doing? Inder, what are you doing? Why is lnder trying to flee from us? Why is lnder coming this way? Chima..catch him. - Boss, police. You will get us killed, where do you think you're going? Where did he go? Forgive me. Turn back. What are you doing? - Forgive me. I won't do it again. - Boss. Don't turn back. Shove them in. - Where are we? What are you doing? I can't see a thing. - That's my stick. It's so dark. Drive. Come on. - Get out. Quickly. Where is he? Sir, before you're fired from your job.. ...l suggest that you resign yourself. It will save you the humiliation. What's happening. It stopped. This was bound to happen. Hit the self. - I'm doing just that. "Papa says someday l'll be famous." Push This wouldn't have happened if you weren't driving so recklessly. Now just push. Nimmi, put the car in gear. - Yes. Come on. Try now. - I am. Nimmi. Where are you going? Flowers for the pretty ladies. How sweet, uncle. And romantic. What do I say? People used to swear by our love-story. Tell her. Tell her. She's feeling shy. Why don't you tell us some story, uncle? What do I say? Come on, push. His grandpa wanted. Come on, push. His grandpa fixed her marriage with some army man. Her family must have thought, he's in the army.. ...and has regular income. He'll keep Pammi happy. But Pammi's happiness was with this Bhalla. I eloped with her on the day of her engagement. ...from the army cantonment and amidst hundreds of army men. Really? - Yes. And then? - Then they got married. Boring. He's a hopeless case. Don't you want to know what happened after the marriage? After they got married, the love between them was over. And when the love was over, so was their marriage. Really sorry, papa. But we're at the station. That's fine, dear. But what do I do about Mohit, he's getting crazy. No matter how hard I try to explain, he just doesn't understand. Sir..very, very, very, very sorry. It so happened that our car broke down. And we're taking the morning train. - I see. Don't worry at all. Nimmi is like my daughter. - Yes. I had a word with the guard. You can pick Nimmi from the station at 10:30. - Fine. I'll be at the station, thank you. Goodbye. Nimmi..talk to me once. Well..she can at least talk to me, can't she? Please tell her, papa. - I'll explain her. Look..l'm already sprouting a moustache, see. I'm trying. Nimmi. Nimmi, I have a plan. We'll have our honeymoon in a helicopter. And there will be no third person to disturb us. Just the two of us. But, brother-in-law, who will fly the helicopter? Anyone..what do you care? Listen, Mohit. I want you to go for now, and I'll see you at 12:00. Until then you'll get big moustaches like Anil Kapoor. Come on.. stop playing games with me Nimmi. How can I get moustaches like Anil Kapoor so soon? Inder. We'll be reaching the station soon. My parents will take me back home. It will all be over. You won't stop me, will you? Let's imagine that I do stop you. Then? Then..we may get married. And maybe 20-25 years later..we'll be travelling to somewhere like them. I would be sleeping in your arms. ...and you will be giving a cute smile like him. Just imagine, lnder. Yeah..just imagine, Nimmi. We'll be neck-deep in debts. You'll be sick, and I'll divorce and throw you out of the house. Just image. Why are you always so negative? Look, Nimmi..you witnessed some of their good moments. You think this is all very nice. I've seen the ugly side of their relationship. But that's how relationships are. Sometimes they fight, something they shower love. I am sure even your parents had some sweet moments between them. "But you never noticed them. Their fights and quarrels is the only thing in your head. You're under a delusion, lnder.. ...and you only see the negativity of every relation. Look, Nimmi. Maybe..l am delusional. But you see a positive sign, hope..goodness in everylhing. That's a kind of illusion as well. That's it then, lnder. I won't come back ever. It's over. Greetings. - Hello. Hello. See, we're here on time. Thank you. Nimmi, thank God you're here. I'm having a tough time making excuses to Mohit. Come on. Good girl. I could never forget the moments we spent together. Though separated..we couldn't be separated. You still dwell somewhere in my hean. Though separated..we couldn't be separated. You still dwell somewhere in my hean. Though separated..we couldn't be separated. You don't know..the love that's in my hean. I don't know how to pacify my hean. I could never forget the moments we spent together. Though separated..we couldn't be separated. You still dwell somewhere in my hean. Though separated..we couldn't be separated. You're an embodiment of my desires. Wherever I am..you're always close. "God knows.." "God knows.." "l can never stay away." Though separated..we couldn't be separated. I could never forget the moments we spent together. Though separated..we couldn't be separated. You're an embodiment of my desires. Wherever I am..you're always close. "God knows.." "God knows.." I could never erase your memories. Though separated..we couldn't be separated. You still dwell somewhere in my hean. Though separated..we couldn't be separated. Why didn't you stop her? Why do you always associate your life with mine? I was helpless. You think I did it intentionally. I don't want to hear your story, seriously. This is not a story, lnder. It's true. Now listen. 'Will you bring the curry or will I have to eat dry bread?' 'Your son didn't leave because I shunned him.' 'Don't curse me all the time.' No matter how many times I said, but she never listened. She had become irritable. Gradually she staned forgetting things. She became careless. And we staned fighting. 'You're always looking at lnder's books.' 'Why don't you understand that he's grown up now?' 'And he left us to..' What.' 'She's gone crazy.' After that..l yelled at her. 'I told you to turn off the furnace, did you do it?' 'What furnace?' 'The bakery's furnace, what else?' 'What happened?' 'My bakery's on fire. Do something.' 'It's my only means of living.' The bakery burned down. And I blamed your mother entirely for it. 'Get in, be comfortable.' 'Rascal, he'll pay.' Get lost. Your cunning aunty took her home. And a month later she sent me divorce papers. I just couldn't understand. Divorce..at this age. No one had even heard about it in Kasol. I was surprised to see your mother's signatures on the divorce papers. 'I won't sign.' 'This is the last time I'm sending you divorce papers.' 'If you don't sign this time..l'll charge you with domestic violence.' 'And listen..you'll be jailed without any bail.' Later I found out that your aunty.. "Wanted to swindle the compensation money. And even after everylhing, when they found out about Pammi's ailment. ...do you know what they did? 'Uncle..come out..where are you?' Those rascals left your sick mother outside my house in the heavy deluge. 'Come on..' 'You'll be fine..l'm right here.' When Pammi came home I realized.. ...that her twitchiness, forgetfulness, it was all pan of her ailment. At first I couldn't understand. ...how I'll arrange money for her treatment. I had no other option other than borrowing money. The bakery wasn't doing any good. I borrowed from every man, every shop, every home in the village. But I would still run shon of money. Every month I had to pay a big amount. And I couldn't stop thinking about what I should do. That's when I borrowed money from Chima on interest. 'And listen..if you fail to return the money..' '..then bring the papers to your house and bakery.' You can call this a story if you like. Or curse me for the rest of your life. Whatever. Mr. Bhalla, in whose name is the locker? My wife..Parminder Singh Bhajanlal Bhalla. Here, sign here. Come on, Pammi..it's a formality. Come on, sign here. D0 it. She's not too well. Look..mom's not too well. Can I sign on her behalf? You're not the nominee. It's in her name and her brother. No problem, I'll sign. Husband's signature will do, right? Mr. Bhalla, are you joking? - Why? In the history of Kasol, there is just one senior citizen divorce case. You! I won't open the locker with your signatures. Kukreja, you know she's Parminder. Open the locker, please. You'll be booked for fraud. For taking your crazy wife's signature and open her locker. Who are you calling crazy? Who are you calling crazy? You're crazy. I am not crazy. - Hold on. Hold on. Calm down. No one's crazy. Calm down, please. Sorry. Look.. - Here. Take mom home. I'll talk to him. Get up, Pammi. Nothings wrong with you. You're absolutely fine. What's all this? - I'm very sorry. Sir..it's really imponant for us to open that locker. We're in a bit of an emergency. It's a very complicated case. There will be a long legal process. It will take around 8-10 months. Thank you. 'While running from life, you come to a turn..' '..where you need to stop before going ahead.' 'Instead of blaming your kin..' '..you need to take a decision.' 'And choose just one path out of the many available.' Speak up, Bhalla. Great. You're speechless now. Has the cat got his tongue? He left me trapped amongst the police. Welcome. Welcome. That's called back to pavilion. Come. I got beaten up because of you. I was chasing you, and the police was chasing me. You two have made my life hell. Now I won't let this mess continue any longer. Look, Chima.. - Bhalla, you.. Don't you dare raise your hand on him. Or else I will beat you up. Beat you up badly. Get that. Let's finish this dispute. Give me the bakery papers.. - Yeah, sign it. You won't sign. Hey dude..stop it now. Don't create a new problem. I am not creating a new problem. You want money, don't you? I have a plan. Come on. - What's wrong, boss? He's asked for four more days. Four days? What's all this? Look..l'll sign on the papers. Take your mother with you..and make your music album. There's no need for that. We'll get the money. We will?

Don't just stand there. - Come on, Chima. We're not paying him. Note it down..5000 rupees. O companiomjust a little longer. The destination of love's calling out to thee. O companiomjust a little longer. The destination of love's calling out to thee. I am neither unfaithfuLnor is there a dearth of love. But our destinies..are completely separate. "How will I find my destination of love?" O companiomjust a little longer. The destination of love's calling out to thee. How is it? No. This? And this? Chima. It should be done overnight. Okay? - Fine. Inder, I am Ronnie's father. Didn't you recognize me? Hello, uncle. - Bless you, son. Good you're back, son. Your father troubled me to death. He would land at my threshold every morning.. ...and say ask your son Ronnie how's my son lnder. What's he doing? What's he eating? What's he drinking? Is he fine out there? Now that you're here..l can breathe a sigh of relief. Okay, son. See you. Come. He's a great boy. "Punjabi wedding folk song." "Punjabi wedding folk song." "Punjabi wedding folk song." "Punjabi wedding folk song." lnder, it's a good thing that you came back. Your mother's condition is so much better because of you. Listen..don't throw too much. We paid for all this. One petal at a time. Come on. One.. Throw it. Hello. - Hello. Welcome. Let's go. Both are looking nice. Boss. Boss, lnder's missing. Why are you whispering it in my ears? Bhalla. Shut up, priest. Hey..where's your son? He must be somewhere around here. Why? - He isn't here. He ran away. Ran away. No, no..he must be here. Inder. - Listen, don't 30" with me anymore. Get that. Your son promised to pay up right after the marriage. He made me pay for all the wedding expenses. Let's go. We won't spare him this time. He's here. Your money! Inder.. It's all there. Should be 2.2 million. Yes? Where did you get the money from? The banks stay closed at this hour. Papa..we were never going to get the money from the bank anyway. Due to mom's condition. "They don't consider this marriage legal. Anyway.. - No, I want to know.. Bhalla sir..forget it, Bhalla sir. We've got the money, so be happy. Think about the results, not the method. Congratulations on your wedding. Thank you, lnder. Where are you going? You can't leave without having sweets. And I still have to give them their wedding gift. Come on. Come. You.. The board had become too rusty. So I took some time to take it down. But it will never come down again. But when did you do this? I never realized.. First come in and take a look. Come on. - Come. Come, mom. WhaLwas the" What was the need to do all this? Why? Come. Come on. Take a look.. - You wanted to work for the rest of your life. And never retire. Yes. - Come sit. Sit down. Now no one's going to retire you. All this money.. I suggest that you sell this bakery and make something of yourself. Let me rectify my mistakes today. You didn't make any mistakes. No mistakes at all. Lies. Why did you never talk to me openly? Always kept everylhing to yourself? Why didn't you call me even once in all these years? Every day you asked Ronnie's father about my well-being.. "But never talked to me. I didn't because I was angry with you. I had a tough time setting up this bakery. But who did I do it for? I thought if you joined me..my bakery would be the best. It would be no.1. But I never thought that you wanted something else from your life. And there was nothing wrong in it. It's not necessary that a doctor's son becomes a doctor. ...or a lawyer's son becomes a lawyer. If a baker's son doesn't want to be a baker, it's nothing wrong. You were right. I never acted like a father. Never thought what's going on in your mind. I thought you're just a means to fulfill my dreams. You did the right thing that you left me. Here..you would've become like me. Hopeless. I am just like you. All my life I kept running away from this fact. ...because I knew I am just like you. Your stubbornness, your temper, your ego, your insecurities. ...l have all that. The only difference is.. I am selfish. I never thought. ...about the conditions. ...and difficulties you'd be facing. Or how's mom? In fact..l came here for my own selfish gains. I couldn't be a good son. I am sorry, Papa- Come here. No, son. Thanks to you..for the first time in my life I'm looking good. There are no flaws in you, son. You've exceeded everyone by far. These days if the parents want to go on a pilgrimage. "Their children buy a ticket for them and say "Go ahead". But you..carried your parents on your shoulder.. ...and also took them around. What you did is much better than going on a pilgrimage. Bless you, son. Bless you. That Chima..was right. "Here comes your Shravan Kumar." "Modern Shravan Kumar." Our Shravan Kumar. Tell me something. Where did you get the money to do all this? Where? You sold your songs, didn't you? Didn't you? Those were just songs. I'll compose new ones. And this time I'll make them even better. You'll make better songs..but not relations. Nimmi's wedding is today. There's still time..go stop her. Go get her. It's pointless now. - Why? The marriage must be over by now? We'll get sister-in-law before the send-off. It's a four hour drive.. I'll get you there in two hours. Boss, police. Come on, hurry up. - Catch them. There's Chima's goons. Stop. See, I told you we'll find Chima here. Catch them. - Yes, sir. Mr. Bhalla, congratulations on your wedding. Catch them. Stop. We must leave now. Arrange for a car. I think..we're late. The ceremonies are over. Nimmi! You're still here. Uncle, what are you doing here? What are you still doing here? - Yes. This is my home. Where else can I go? I'll be spending the rest of my life right here. But you..were supposed to marry Mohit. Mohit got married. - Got married. What? I mean..the day I returned from the station.. Nimmi, try to understand. Listen. Mohit saw me coming back. And he knew that he wasn't talking to Nimmi.. "But Bubbly, who was posing as Nimmi. Mohit is looking so handsome. Mom, I want to marry Bubbly and not Nimmi. I don't mind! Oh.. Dear.. Will you marry my son? Will you? Please? Then what? Finally I had to accept what I kept running from all my life. When things are destined to happen, why run from it? I made three music albums, and they were all chanbusters. Aren't you lnder, the Singer? Autograph please. Chima. He's still confused whether he's our friend or enemy. The money we gave him, he invested those in our bakery again. And he takes his share from the profit. Son, how are you? How was your show in Delhi? - Super hit..sold out, papa. Hail Goddess. Hi, baby. Mama-Papa - Hey, son..how are you? Oh, God..l completely forgot. What happened? Grandma, your medicine. And your sonny..takes good care of his grandma. That journey taught me that even if there are problems in the family.. ...If we try to solve them instead of run away, the family will never break. If everyone lives together, keeps the parents happy.. "Then you will be happy always. And all will be well. "Break all the rules." "Do what you never did before." If you're in the mood to party. "Don't wait for the weekend to come. "Break all the rules." "Do what you never did before." If you're in the mood to party. "Don't wait for the weekend to come. Everyone should have this common thought. There should be four Saturdays in a week. There should be four Saturdays in a week. "Saturdaymot one but four." Could it ever be..that the sun's on a holiday. "And time's in our control." In a long limo..we've have a blast. "With a beauty in our arms." The speaker's volume should be high. There should be four Saturdays in a week. "Four." There should be four Saturdays in a week. "Four." I said let's panynwhy don't you listen to me. Life is too short-lived to waste. "Stop being shy and scared." Break the rules and the dance floor. It's your boy Badshah. When the music plays..you'll stan dancing. I'll give you a tight slap..if you talk nonsense. Those who don't want to party can go to hell. Boys in the house, baby..All is Well. 365 days in a year..but only 52 Saturdays. Flush the calendarjorget all the rush. "Youth is too shon to waste." World-wide you should preach only one thing. There should be four Saturdays in a week. There should be four Saturdays in a week. "Allis Well."
