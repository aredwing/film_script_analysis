Breathe. - No, no... Come on. Once more, push. Keep up the pressure. That's good. Here we are. Yes, that's right. - Honey, you're so good. - Katrine, take a look at this. Have you seen what it is? It's... - It's a girl. - It's a girl? THE BLESSING - Hi. - Hi. Is she okay? Yes, she's perfect. - Well, Katrine, you're awake. - Yes. We need to get started on the breastfeeding. She must be hungry by now. Hi... Hello there, little darling. You want your mother? Touch her cheek with your nipple, and she'll open her mouth. Come on, darling. There now. That's it. My, my... That's it. - I might cancel Amsterdam. - Why? It's just that I'm leaving in three days, and I'd rather be with you. Andreas, it's important. There, now. Have you talked to my mother? - Yes... I'd rather be with you. - What did she say? Not much. It's just that I'm leaving in three days, and I'd rather be with you. Katrine, it's okay. Isn't it? Sleep tight. - Yes, it's Lise. - Hi, Mom. I'm sorry. - For what? - We agreed that you should be there. - Yes, we did. - I'm sorry. - I don't want to talk now. It's late. - But... Here, Katrine. Katrine, wait a bit with that. Surprise! We got you! Congratulations. - Thanks. - My, she's cute. Keep it down. Let's go into the livingroom. How could you do this! Let's go in. - The champ! - Good job. - It's some box you've bought here. - Yes. It's pretty wild. - Good thing Katrine isn't all thumbs. - True. I'd be lost without Katrine. - Are you picking her up? - Yes. - What a cutie. - Want a little pacifier? - She looks like Andreas. - Let's hope not. - Oh, are all these people too much? - I think she needs another diaper. What did I tell you? He knows how to change a diaper. - You think it's okay? - A sip just makes them sleep better. I remember when we had Andreas... Alright, Katrine. Let's hear the whole thing. Right from the start. From the very first contraction. - I don't know... - Hey, I'd like a drink too. Well... Andreas says it only took eight hours. Jrgen! Let's hear the story! I just felt like it would never stop. It was overwhelming. What was the midwife like? I never figured out who was who. They were just mean, the lot of them. That's how I felt when they removed my gallstone. Cheers, Katrine. - I bet it's precisely the same. - Welcome home to the three of you. And congratulations on the house. Let us know if you need any help. - You won't get much from Andreas. - No... - Mom. - You're having a party? It looks nice. Mom... - I didn't know they were coming... - Stop that little girl's voice, will you? Well, I went to the hospital, but they'd already left... - Hi, Lise. And congratulations. - Thank you, and likewise. - Congratulations. - Hello, Granny. Congratulations. - Well, it takes some getting used to. - Congratulations. - So, you've been here long? - A few hours to get the place ready. - Andreas is changing Rosa. - Oh, that's nice. - Can I take your coat? - Yes, please. Thank you. What a lot of presents. Look at this. One of my friends is into applied art. - Did I interrupt anything? - We were hearing about the delivery. - Oh yes. Wouldn't want to miss that. - Go on, Katrine. - One chair coming up. - Thanks. Katrine, I think she's hungry. - Hi, Lise. - Andreas, congratulations. Thank you. - Should I ask her to leave? - No! We should have invited her. I feel sorry for her. And I panicked and downed a glass of champagne. - I wasn't thinking. - Well, there's no harm in that. - Can I come in? - Yes, of course. Oh, she's lovely. And congratulations on Amsterdam. It sounds exciting. Yes, very. I'll join the others. Do you have everything you need, Lise? - Yes, thank you. - And I'm sorry. - I quite forgot to invite you. - Yes, it's fine. I'll be off again soon. I just came by to give Rosa her teddy bear. Mom, can't you stay a little? I just have to finish breastfeeding. Okay, if you don't take too long. All right... take it. There, now. Andreas? Andreas... - Could you come? - Of course. What's the matter, dear? - She's just a bit upset... - Sit down. I'll take her. How wonderful that he's so calm and natural about everything. Yes, he's very relaxed. By the way, thanks for taking care of Katrine and Rosa while he's away. - Well, that's fine with me. - No thanks, darling. No more for me. Have a nice time, all of you. Have some nice days. Yes, thank you. Mom. - I didn't think you had the time. - No, but you might have asked. Anyway, it's no matter now. Bye, darling. What's up? Is she asleep? Good. Andreas? When you go away... I don't think I want your mother to come. Oh? All right... why? I just need to be on my own for a bit. - Do you think she'll be upset? - Well, I think you can count on that. Hi, Mom. I just wanted to thank you for the teddy bear - - and tell you that Sonja isn't coming over after all. So if you'd like to drop by, that would be lovely. Well, just call me, okay? Bye. Look, there's a little horse. Hi. Katrine? I'm the health visitor, Vibe. We're going to look at your little girl. Thank you. - Let me get that. - Thank you. - And do we go in here? - Yes. Coffee? No, I think I'll wait a while. Oh, she's snug and comfortable, isn't she? Oh, thanks. Would you take her up and undress her, so we can weigh her, please? There, asleep, eh? Just put her there. That's right. - Yes... What's her name? - Rosa. Rosa... - How was the delivery? - I think it went well. Normal, I guess. - How do you mean? - Well, just your experience of it. There, yes. Thank you. Yes, it's a little cold, isn't it? Let's see how much you weigh. I'll just pick her up. - Just below 3,000. - Oh. You can feed her if that's why she's crying. - Are you happy? - Yes...Yes, I think so. Oh, she's lost 125 grams since birth. We need to check up on that. I'll write: Fine baby girl, lost 125 grams. And then I'll put down: weight control in three days, okay? - Do you like to breastfeed? - Yes. It may be a little tough to begin with. But you are okay with it? - Yes. - Well, it is best. Let me show you. You should try to get the nipple all the way down her throat. Let me show you. You grab and squeeze it a bit. And then the nipple goes all the way back here. Try that. That's good. Can you feel it? Yes. You just have to keep at it. It takes some patience. Just call me if you need to talk, okay? Or else I'll be back in three days. Just stay put, I'll let myself out. Bye. Bye-bye. There, there. There, now. There, there. There, now. - May I use your bathroom? - Yes, it's right there. It's coming, it's coming. There. Bye. Mom, would you please call back. I feel really awful. Hello. Mom, you have to come. I feel really ill. I'm dizzy. I nearly fainted at a caf! Rosa kept screaming - - and people thought I was mistreating her. Katrine. Katrine! Turn down the volume! Mom... How long has she been lying like that? Yes, come here. There, little darling. She's soaked! Let Granny do this, yes. Yes... There, now. Come here, and let me look at you. Aren't you a pretty girl? - Yes... - Can you sleep with me tonight? For Rosa's sake? Mom. How did you feel about me when I was a baby? Fine. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Did you get some sleep? - Yes. I've made the batter for the pancakes you loved when you were a kid. I just have time to make some before I'm off. - Are you leaving? - Yes, of course I'm leaving. It was difficult to get someone else to take my shift yesterday. Why don't you take a bath? You look like you could need it. Here's the number for the emergency service, if you get dizzy again. Bye, Rosa. Aren't you coming out to say goodbye? Katrine, what's the matter? You really are a strange child. Katrine, what's going on? Dammit, are you out of your mind? There, now, little darling. No, no, nothing happened. Mom, I feel weird. I don't think I can be a mother. - I don't think I want to. - Stop that right now! Do you hear? There, now. What are you doing, Katrine? Look, she's not getting enough. Yes... No, Katrine! But, Katrine... Get up! Yes, it's nice. It's so nice. Just take my car. The keys are in my coat pocket. That's so good. My, my, do we have the hiccups now? - How is your mother, by the way? - She's fine. I haven't seen her for a while. And what about yourself? Are you okay? Yes. Or at least, I hope so. - Well, thanks. - Tell your mother hi. - And I'll throw a dinner party soon. - I'll tell her. I'm sorry, but the visit at the doctor's took a little longer. - Do you want me to make coffee? - Not for my sake. - Could you feed Rosa while we talk? - Of course. - She's lost another 100 grams. - Okay. How is the breastfeeding coming along? Well, I think I'm doing what you showed me the last time. But I may have misunderstood something. Well, I think she needs to go on the bottle. Do you have a good contact with Rosa on the whole? I'd prefer to breastfeed. I think it's best for Rosa. Good. Continue a couple of days, if that's what you want. But then we may have to think along other lines. Is that a deal? - Bye. - Thanks. Likewise. And good luck with it. I know you don't want it, but I can't sit idly by while she's losing weight. Hi. Hi, darling. Hi, little darling. Hi, Lise... - So, you're here? - She'll be going home soon. How was Amsterdam? They took it all. They were thrilled and didn't want to change a thing. They'll pay to be the first to know if we come up with something new. - Why, that's wonderful. - Yes, completely crazy. - Can I take a shower before dinner? - Yes, of course. Good. - Have you told him you've been ill? - I'm fine. Mom, don't! Give me that book! Don't do this! Rosa is losing weight, because Katrine can't breastfeed. - I can! - No! Rosa has lost a lot of weight. - How much? - The health lady told me to continue. - She's losing weight, Katrine! - Can't we give her a bottle, Katrine? Katrine! Katrine, open the door. - Open the door, please. - Not until she's gone. Stop this nonsense at once. Open the door, Katrine. Or let us at least have Rosa. Leave us alone now, Mom. Are you hungry? We know how to do this, don't we? There, now. There, now. What the hell is going on? No, no, no. There, there, little darling. I love you. Yes... Hi. I don't want you anymore. Or Rosa. What are you saying? What are you saying? - I don't want you anymore. - What the hell do you mean by that? What the hell do you mean by that? Katrine! Have you heard anything? Have you no idea where she might be? No, and she didn't bring her cell phone, so I can't... We'll find her. Excuse me. Have you seen a young woman in... What's she wearing? She's wearing a blue overall and a long coat with a flower pattern. No, I haven't. Hey, there she is. Stop! Katrine! Hey, stop! Hello, stop, dammit! - What are you doing? - I have to talk to my girlfriend. She's not feeling well. Thank you. Darling... Katrine. Come on, darling. Let's go home. Okay? Katrine, people are waiting. Come on. Let's get off. Hi, Katrine. Aren't you cold? Your mother tells me you don't want to talk. - We need to talk about Rosa, too. - Yes, but not here. Andreas, the most important thing is for Rosa to stay with your family... What are you talking about? We... I think you'd better go up and rest for a while. Yes, Katrine. Let's go up, okay? - Where's Rosa? - She's sleeping in the livingroom. Come on. Katrine, look at me. What is this all about? Listen, darling. We've talked about it - - and I'll help out with Rosa. So you don't have to worry. Then you're taking her? No. I'll be moving in with you for a while. That'll give you some peace and quiet. - Can you feel that you love me? - Yes, of course I can. You'd better use your strength on getting well again. Katrine! Katrine! How long between contractions? Okay, you can wait a while then. Yes, bye. Hi. What can I do for you? I need help. Hi. Do you want to talk a little? What's your name? - Katrine. - I'm Dorte. - She's hungry. - Yes. - Let's get her a bottle while we talk. - Yes. It's okay, Katrine. It was a good thing that you came. - Very brave of you. - Yes. We'll work it out. - Okay? - Yes. Don't go in there. Don't disturb her! - Where's my grandchild? - Look, you'll wake the patients! - Where is Rosa? - I must ask you to leave. We called the police and all the hospitals. - Do you want me to call security? - No. Okay, but not for long. And keep your voices down! - Where is Rosa? - In another room, so I can rest. They say they can help me here. And that it was good I came. They say many mothers feel like this after giving birth. Well, that's good. But Rosa's not the one who's ill, is she? - So she shouldn't be here. - Katrine, please come home. I'll help you. - I'll go out and find her. - Mom? Don't ruin this too. Darling, this isn't only about you, but about what's best for Rosa. And you know best, as always, right? - What do you mean by that? - Your way is always best, right? You take control of everything. I think it's best that you leave. Okay, but don't call me the next time you can't manage things. You'll have to leave too. Katrine... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Andreas. Hi there. Would you like some fresh air in here? It's such lovely weather outside. - There. - Thanks.
