It really does. - You'll love it. Hardly. I'm gonna be late tonight. A few of us are having drinks with the new Creative Director. You should come. He's suppose to be terrific ... and ... who knows he might want to look at some of your stuff. What? Shooting cans of Spam or Reboks artfully against a back drop of the Grand Canyon? Been there. Done that. Thanks. You son of a bitch! Get out of here! Come on. Suki, you're making a big mistake, baby. Please, open your door and let me back in, now. You're the one who lives here. Have fun. Yeah. Suki, let me back in. You don't understand. I'm a man, not responsible for how the woman feel about me. Stop that now. - Look. You're making a big mistake. Now let me in the door! Now! Pal. Come on, pal. Get a clue. Who the hell are you? Today maybe I'll be ... her big brother. She think she's so goddamn special. Well, let me tell you something girlfriend! You won't be beautiful forever! Kick a guy like me out ... next one might not be as nice. See you around, Suki. Thanks Keyes. Tripped up, asshole! Met him at the starhouse last week. Two days and he's already got someone else on his side. Suki ... Maybe you're on the side. Hey, Ground Zero? Yeah. Just let me ... Yeah, right. Oh, you gonna make ... make sure you gonna ... - Excuse me. - Can we get thru, please? Thank you. - Thanks. Oh, I don't know. It's a not worth ... Hold the door. Oh, god. - I'm sure I'm pretty good about getting out of bed this morning. Morning. - Hi. - Morning. Oh, Dick. If you got some time this morning, we need to talk. - Yeah, sure. What's it? Toilet's break up again? No, no, nothing like that. - You know. Let me clean up. Hey hon, I'm no superman. So that's what you said last night. - Let'em fun. Superman. Keyes, I feel like ... dumb. So? What's so pimping about that? Morning. Fine rain. Washed the scum off the street. Thank you, Trevis. A big one. Are you talking to me? So ... You actually met him. Briefly. Well, I'm jelaous, Suki. I mean you always keep your men so ... so secret. And then suddenly poof and they're gone. Ahhh the start of another beautiful day. What is it, Keyes? What's wrong with me? Why do I end up with such loosers? - Suki, uh ... It's not your fault, you know. People change. In six days they change? Come on, Su don't do this. Not for this guy. He's dangerously craft. So ... What's up? He's all yours. Well ... We were thinking of maybe ... having show ... and opening, really. Like the downtown lofts. No. No way. It's in your lease. This is not a gallery. It's a studio space. - Just let me finish. It would be like a big party. Would include Pauli from downstairs ... I don't have insurance, I don't have the permits. Don't have security. - Yeah. And you don't have any tenants. At least not us anymore. And Su when was last time you made any money. - Come on now, I bought a penny from her. Last year. - Yeah, exactly. See, Dick ... It's not just for us. I mean ... You've been trying to rent last studio in your building for a couple of months now. A show might be just thing to attract another tenant. - Haha, clever. Very clever. Not clever at all. This is a blatant manipulation. Look ... Dick, we need the show. We need to get our stuff out there. Absolutely not. - Oh, god. Come on Dick, don't be one. Where're you going? I'm gonna go get ready for the show. Keyes? Hey Keyes? Looking to buy ... or just browsing? No, no. Actually I took a picture of you in there. And ... I think it's gonna be pretty good. I shall maybe able to sell it. I'm very happy for you. Yeah, well ... I don't think I should be the only one to profit. Well, thanks. Son ... Gotcha. Like it? Yeah. It's ... it's interesting. Been in my family for generations. I want you to have it. No, I ... No, I can't. You're an artist, don't you? Surely you can appreciate the craftsmanship. Do me a honor. Take it. Please. Up beyond the surface ... look how the beautifully images are preserved. You've got my vote. I think the show'll be fun. Open the whole place up. Besides I already checked ... there is nothing else going on the week of the 24th. Wait a minute, that's next week. You're obviously talkin' about work already done. Yes? As long as your promise the sculpture that doesn't rust, Pauli. Or leak. Perhaps you like something in whited lenolium. No, it's just that your sculpture ... to me is just kind of scary. I mean that just how I feel. That's not necessarily bad. Scaring people with your work. At least it's a reaction. I think the only real emotion left in this world is ... fear. You're right. Well, she is. Llanie, we're in here. Hi. I have to pee really bad, I'll be right back. So ... Keyes. Tell us. What really scares you? Red. Red, Dick. And ... Republicans, yeah they scare me too. The old Keyes' cover-up, huh? Yeah, don't ask him anything that digs too deep, you know. He'll just ... cover it up with a joke. Come on, Keyes. You can tell us. We're all family here. There is a scary idea. The american family. That's why I spend so much time preserving delusionary institution that screws up so many people I'll never know. Very eerie. I'll drink to that ship. I know what scares me. When I was a child ... there're creatures that lived in my room. The boogeyman? No. He was under the bed. These demons were different. They would wake me up at night and dance for me. Dance for you? Sometimes I swear I could just reach out and touch them. Honey ... Where did you get this? Some bum gave it to me on the street. You can toss it. No. You can toss it. Scoot over. Oh, my god. Look at this. I love it. I do. It's fantastic. Can I borrow it? Would you mind? I'll give it back. Actually Suki you can borrow it if you promise not to give it back. Thank you. So ... What do you think? About what? About the show. All right. All right, you've got a show. So, this new Creative Director is just like everyone said. He's an older guy, but ... I don't know he's ... He's really in tense. What'you thinking about? How beautiful you are. What are you really thinking about? What Dick said tonight. Think I hide thinks. Walls around me. Well ... I think we all do, but ... I've got into yours, haven't I? Suki? Where are you my little pickle. God damn paint slappin' bitch. Thrown me out. Me? Man, that's ugly. Oops, sorry. No bullshit me. What the hell? Wow. What the ... ? No. Oh, my god. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! So, where is this woman Suny? - Suki, sir. She's upstairs. She's ... she's pretty upset. She's with a police officer right now. I take it you knew this guy. Ray? Oh, yeah. Ray and she were ... How long? A week. Well ... six days actually, sir. Well ... Was the Ray in habit of breaking in? Well ... no ... - Let me show you something. They ... just split up. You know. They're over here, sir. Apparently Raymond drink up quite a bit. Broke in and decide to settle things his own way. Who knows. Maybe he would cut her up as well. But I guess he must have panicked. Lost his footing and went to the window. What do you think spooked him? He was pretty drunk. It could've been anything. A noice, a shadow ... Maybe just got a look at himself. Whatever it was, he will take it to his grave with him. Is someone here? No, no. This is me. Is this the first? People? You don't take pictures of people. Oh, maybe I've been missing something. Wait, is this Keyes Terry talking? Whose last show consisted of thirty six assorted angles on Rancho psycho nuclear power plant. So ... I'm entering a new period. Time to give people a try. Does that mean you're gonna give me a try? I mean ... What's going on with us. What're we doing? I think we're doing just fine. In a couple of weeks you get a litle nervous and we had the same little talk. Don't patronize me. It isn't like that. I wanna move on. I wanna move to the next ... level. And I wanna do it with you. God, I never met someone so afraid of commitment. Look Llanie ... I love you. I think you do. I still don't know what you're so afraid of. All right. Here we go. Good. Very good. - Tell me about your father. I don't really know. I know what you mean. No, really. You don't. I never met him. Why you never told me that before? Well, I'm not exactly proud of it. He knocked up my mom when she was like sixteen then disappeaed. Come on, Keyes I can't believe you never told me that before. I feel like a such an idiot. talking to you about the next ... level. I hardly even know you. Just wait. Hi. Do you ... ? Are you okay? Fine. New work? Wanna see? Oh, this is great. The demons ... like you said last night ... your demons. Watch them dance. Oh, yeah. Oh, this is fantastic. You know, it's amazing ... how you work. It just ... flows out of you. Just, just ... flows. On a good day. Today is especially good day. Are you scared ... Dick? Take my hand. Dance with me. Let's dance with the demons. Shadows ... They're all just shadows. It's all we can't never capture, you know. Light is deceiving. We see what we want to see. Do you understand? You know Suki, I know this gonna sound funny, but ... I've always been kind of intimidated by you. Scared even. It's just that you're so beautiful. But I guess ... you knew that, didn't you? Look ... what do you see? Close your eyes. Now, what do you see? Darkness. But there is an outline. It's you. You don't need to be afraid anymore. What the? Oh, shit. Coming. Coming. Coming. Hi. Detective Clark. I'm sorry to bother you. I tried to call earlier, but nobody answered. Oh, come on in. This is just formality. I have your statement about last night. I wonder if you'd sign it for us? Take your time, look it over and sign at the bottom. This other fellow ... Keyes Terry, I have his statement here. Is he home? Keyes? Keyes, you're home? Yeah. Are you okay? Oh, hi. Mr. Terry, I have your statement from last night ... and if you look it over and sign it for us. Yes, sure. Are you okay? Absolutely. I have one of those statement that covered Dick Cutler. Should I just leave it with you or ... Dick? Dick, why don't you come out here and take care of this? Dick. Keyes? Dick? Hello? Yes, this is Keyes Terry. Yeah, I ... Yes. Can you tell ... Who was that? That detective Clark. He wants me to identify a body. What're you talking about? Whose? He said he wouldn't need me if they knew it. It's bizarre. Suki. Suki? Suki? What could've happened? I don't know. We're just acting crazy today. Something won't worked. No I.D, no nothing. Except for this little note ... that we found in his pocket. It has your name and adress written on it. You know this man? No. I don't, I mean ... I ... I saw him once across the Cafe, but no, I don't know. That's just excess air escaping from the lungs. You'll get use to it. What? Reminds me of some ... Keyes ... Honey, what is it? Nothing. The body ... How you're gonna bury it? One piece at the time I imagine. Oh, well ... I assuming that a family member doesn't claim on. These guys usually wind up as cadavers in med school. Probably his gratest contribution to society. I'd like to pay for that a proper burial. Wait. No, wait, wait, wait. You're gonna ... you're gonna have to help me in that. Do you know this man or not? No. But I'd like to make sure he ... got properly buried. Can you arrange that? Like I said, I'll pay for it. Yeah. I think we can take care of that. Yeah. Keyes? What happened tonight ... at the marque? I don't know. Yes, you do. Tell me. It's just ... I've seen that guy laying there. He's all alone. Make me think ... of my father ... you know. You don't think that ... - No. Then why? Who knows. I don't know maybe my father's lying on the streets some place right now. Like to think somebody would take care of him. Somebody may return the favor. Did you ever wonder what he was like? I bet he was like you. I bet you'd like him very much. Suki? Suki, where are you? Are you here? I haven't been able to think about anything else all day. Oh, god! Suki! Damn it. Suki. So, Mr. Cutler you were the last one to see her alive and when was this? This afternoon, sir. This afternoon ... she was working hard ... painting, you know like there was no tomorrow, so ... well ... I think she was getting kinda lonely, so I just did what I could, you know to keep her company. I want you all take it really easy tonight, okay? Yeah. Keyes? What're you looking at? Me, I guess. I can't believe how much has happened. I'm gonna miss her. So am I. Would you come to bed, please? Yeah. Well you get what you've paid for. I'm still trying to figure out why you did this. Is he in there? - Oh, yeah you just missed it. Touching scene. You guys work fast. Franklin I. Bronner's his name, how? Basic, I called up his prints. His history was there. It figured it was only fair since he had yours. You mean, he had a police record. Yeah, you might say that. Yeah. What for? You sure you wanna know? You haven't paid the bill for all this shit. I'd hate to have you rethink your offer. You're kidding me, right? This happened 26 years ago upstate New York. Place called Amityville. Your friend here blew his whole family. Dad, mom, brother and sister. That's why you wanted to meet me to tell me this? I thought you oughta know. I also wanna know more about why you think he tried to get in touch with you. Actually it is pretty famous case. At the trial there were a lot of angry people waiting outside the courthouse pushing for a death penalty. That's a ... he copped insanity plea. Claimed he was possessed by the devil. You okay? Yeah. This picture looks ... looks familiar. Can I keep this? So, then what happened to him? They sent him to Danamore. Where? Danamore state hospital. Cookie jar up north. They released him seven years ago when Reagan cut the budget from mental institutions. As like ... Bronner sliped right thru their fingers. Cured. So ... I guess he just saw your name somewhere, huh? Maybe ... a photograph in the magazine or something? I wish. Though will never know why he came after you. What? What the fuck!? Who did this, Clark!? Who did this? I never said anything about that! Hey ... Keyes, relax, huh? - What? Somebody just screwed up the paperwork. Somewhere up the line. I mean that's not like people waiting in line to help bury the homeless these days. You know what I mean? Somebody just made wrong assumption. Take it easy, okay? Yeah, right. Yeah. Bronner Franklin I. Let's see. Admitted December 11th, 1966. Prognosis paranoid, delusional, sociopath. Claim to be communing with unknown evil power. Let's see. You said you're a student? Yeah at a community central. - Yes. Well, that's fine by me. As you can see there's nothing to do around here anyway until they closed left wind down. There used to be a lot of Bronner types. So, like a genetic sort of thing by my estimation. Really. These paranoid delusary murdery types. By all accounts. One day they're just fine and then "pink" something clicks on the place and they're off to the races. It's like the neighbourhood said, he was such a quiet type. You seem like a quiet type. Look at me. I can't seem to shut up. Oh, we don't get a lot of visitors here. Is there anything else I can do for you? Actually I was wonderin' if I could see his room if that's possible. You fellas always wanna go to the room. Like there's some spirit there. It's all in the file. Suit yourself. Cell 207 south wing. It's shut down so watch your step. You ... knew this Mr. Bronner? Actually no, I ... I met him once. He ... gave me a gift. I see. I bet that was a mirror. How'd you know that? How did you know it was a mirror? I read minds. I'm clarevoient. It's in the file. Everything is in the file. What does it say in the file about the mirror? You know? The one advantage of murdering your entire family? You're sure to inherit everything. After Bronner got out of here, he could have had a whole house in Amityville. Full of furniture. According to this, all he wanted was one mirror. Everything else was up for auction. Why do you supose that was? I don't know. Watch your step. Come on, honey. Keyes ... we gotta go. Oh, god how many years in this place. Oh, no. Surprise, surprise. Guess, who's got a visitor? Who the hell are you? - Oh no, not this game again. Easy. Don't make me smash you up. This is a mistake! And you made it, Bronner. I'm not Bronner. It's my father. Mom? Franklin ... Franklin ... This is your wife. Don't you remember her? She's come a long way to see you. Frank ... Nur ... Help me. Am I crazy, nur? Why don't you let us decide that? Keyes, come over here. Don't be scared, honey. Hello son. Dad! Oh, my god. Mom! We could've met in my office. Whose in that grave, Clark? Tell me. - No, you tell me. I went to Danamore today. Goddamnit that's my father in there and you knew it! Why didn't you tell me?! I wasn't sure. You had to know I'd go down there. Didn't you have any idea what it would that do to me to find out who he was and what you've done? You already knew, Keyes. You knew. Those memories were buried inside you. They had to come out. You have to deal with them. Who the hell are you? I worked with the special detailed that focuses on psychopathology. So, what like massmurders and serial killers? Yeah, that sort of thing. Yeah. It's a growth industry. If we'd been around the time your father's crime was committed that would've been our concern. As it is, I'm making it mine now. Let's see. You've been watching over me since thise thing started. You and your special details deciding whether or not I can learn about my father ... by myself. What. This your job. Screwin' with peoples lives?! Keyes, by the time I figured out, who the hell Bronner was, I realize you had to know. I checked the records. You were there, you saw it all. Now, maybe you blocked it. Because children who witness this kind of stuff either block or the'll become obsessive. Even thinking they may do that sort of thing themselves one day. And you've lived thru your pain for the last few years, Keyes. But you've been on borrowed time. Now this bill is come due. I wanna help you. I'll make some coffee. He was only seventeen when he committed the murders. He'd been in and out of mental institution throughout his childhood. Even still. He never showed any tendency toward violence at all. - Did he know she was pregnant? I think the first he heard he had a son, was a day your mother took you to visit him at the mental hospital. So, after he got out ... he came here. Why? It's like he tracked you down. Maybe he wanted you to remember. That's pretty frightening. What did you see at that day? Nothing. He'd gave me that mirror over there and he said that was in his family for years. Well, that kind of make sense in the strange sort of way. So, that mirror came from THE house. Apparently. I wanna get it out of here. I'll take care of it in the morning. The storm's coming. It'll pass. Where's the sun going? It doesn't matter. I'm with you. You're up early. Sweetie ... Those are your photographs. Why're you destroying them? Working on an idea for the opening. I need to lay it out first. Really? American gothic ... two. That's what I'm gonna call it. Kind of a send up to the whole Grant Wood, ... Norman Rockwell. Hell I'll well rock you. Funny, never thought of it. So, you're gonna ... You're gonna blow these up? Huge ... Lifesize. Gonna be a build ... that center around that kind of like a huge Thanksgiving scene. I don't get it. Not that I have to. A huge happy Thanksgiving scene. You know, mom, dad, couple of kids ... turkey ... That stuff you growth up with. - A turkey? Yep. A turkey. This is just gonna have this rotting mold sorta shit growing around the bottom, you know. Signifying the inevitable degeneration of the American family. But ... that's too ... Is everything okay, sweetie? Yeah. I'm just very excited about this. And so am I. What te hell is this doing here? I thought you said you're gonna get rid of it. I tried to workin'it. Okay. Bye. Bye. Oh, my god. Keyes? Honey, you're in there? Come in. Why not? Hey ... You're okay? I saw your ... in the other room your thing. Is it done? Where've you been? Work. What do you think? You've been working all day, sweetie? Watch. Look. What? There. Oh, my god. They're all this way. The emulsion ran. I've seen it before, but ... No, no. Not like this. Look, They're all ... dead. It more looks kind of like an ink blot. Doesn't it? I guess everybody see something different. Yeah. What do you see? Maybe it's time for you to take a break. Llanie, I need this for the show. Come on. We'll figure something else out. Come on. Yeah. Keyes. What is it? Listen. It's only a dream. Where're you going? Been having in the nightmares for a week now. From since I met him. In these dreams ... it's the only explanation. That's not possible. You know that. Don't you? Yeah. But they're so real. It's like Clark said. You repress the memory ... And I guess it's just trying to get out. I don't have a memory what happened in Amityville. I wasn't born yet. Maybe this mind. What? - Maybe I'm gonna commit the same crime. Maybe it's my destiny. Just like Bronner, maybe it's in the blood. Remember what else Clark said? He said that it was easy to become obsessed with that thought. You're in control of your own life. I think I lost it. - Then take it back. We'll take back control together. What Bronner did was a terrible thing. But that doesn't mean we're gonna relive his insanity. You're not gonna kill anyone. How do you know that? - I know you're stuck in it right now. But you have to get to the other side. How? You can do it. What? Kill us. Kill us all. I think you need an ending for your show. This is it. This is what? Come on. Look ... Here's my thinking. When something terrifies you, the best thing to do is to confront it. Head on. I mean that's practically what you do for a living. You're an artist. You're suppose to be scared and confused. So, go after what scares you. Go after Bronner. You think this is funny. - No, I'm serious. You've got this ridiculous idea that your destiny is to shoot your family. Well ... Dick, Jane, Pauli we're your family. Shoot us. We can put red food color in it. It'll look like blood. I'm sorry, I just don't see the connection. All right, maybe it's a stupid idea. Keyes, I can only help you to a certain point. Tonight's your chance. You designed this crazy show for a reason. See it thru. Hey, Keyes. Man, you look like shit. Come on in, come on in. You want take a look? Sure. - So, come on. Come in here. Come on. Gently, gently, gently ... Guns on a timer. Set to go off sometime before the year 2001. I called this ... When ... and where. It's like ... life. Right? The TV set up. I mean ... Everyone's used to watching violence on TV, right? I'm giving them ... an option. Hey ... you all right, hombre? I don't know. So much death around here, Pauli. I don't intend to die. Actually no one doesn't till it really happens, all right? It's not loaded. Right? Yeah, that's good. Here we go. Here we go. Hi. Thanks for coming. Show's right in there. Here you go. What? That's what I'm trying to get it. She was really destroyed. Her lover died recently. I heard she committed a suicide. Her work really shows it. You're a very brave man, Pauli. A loaded gun ... with all these critics around. One of you critics to stay here while I go in the can. Keyes. Honey, you're okay? So ... When I'm gonna to do this? I don't know. It's going great though. Janet was right. A Scot from the Times's here. And I think grant people showed up. So ... about ten minutes. I'll tell everyone ten minutes. Okay. You reach inspector Clark's office. If this is an emergency, please dial 911, otherwise leave a message him. Clark ... this is Keyes. I need your help. Oh, god. It's okay we'll take care of it. Candles. Janet? Maybe I could a find the candles. Good idea, Dick. - Where's the flashlight? I'll be right back. Watch out for the matches, will you? If I get thru this evening, no more artists. Jesus Christ. Dick ... Hello? Oh, my god. Suki? Dick ... help me. I'm so alone. You promised me. You said forever. Is that really you? You said ... forever. Dick ... I wanna take you with me. No, you keep away from me. Hold me. Touch me. It's coming. There we go. - Yeah. Is Keyes ready? Yes. Let's do it. Gentlemen. Okay, right this way. It's called the American Gothic 2. It's a performance piece. It's compelling, probing and mercifully short. Excuse me. Get the hell out of that chair. Come on, man, it's probably not loaded anyway. You're in here, aren't you Bronner? Watching me. Waiting ... No, you know I'm not gonna do it! I'm not you! I'm not. Go to hell, Bronner. I refuse. Son ... Oh, no, Su. Dad? Is that you? I should have gone to Parsons. I should have! But people like you said I had a head for bussiness! But I don't have now. Do I? Do I, Keyes!? Where're you going? Come back here! Are you a landlord? Oh, Bronner. I'm proud of you, son. Now ... it's up to you. What is? The Amityville. It's in your blood. Where the hell is Dick? Maybe we should just go on. I told you he'd weasle out. What was that? Ladies, this ain't what we rehearsed. Keyes ... Look at me. Jesus. Shit. Keyes. Keyes! No! Freeze! Keyes ... Stop. Look at me. Hold your fire, hold your fire. Yes, son ... Son, you can do it. Come on. - Everybody down! - Cover up ... No! It's in your blood. Son ... Come on. Leave me alone! Did they lose their mind? Keyes ... Hey ... Big mistake, Keyes. Seven years - bad luck.
