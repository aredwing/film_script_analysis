Y'all seen Melvin? - That crazy white dude? - Yeah, white chocolate. Man, I ain't seen Melvin in a while. Melvin's somewhere though. He's somewhere to be found. - But what you looking for Melvin for? - Boy gotta go to court. - He goin' be late. - Trouble again? He ain't never gonna get his son back acting like this, man. He looks like he should stop doing everything he been doing. They ain't stoppin' shit. - Let me go find his ass. - Somebody gon' find him. - A repeat. A repeat. - Somebody gon' find him. - I'll catch y'all on another side. - Take care of yourself. Alright. Melvin! Where you at, you motherfucker? I told y'all. You wanna make a movie about Melvin? You gon' to spend half of your time trying to find this motherfucker. - You seen Melvin? - No, I ain't seen that motherfucker. Damn! Hey, if you see him tell him to head on home! - Alright, I got that. - Alright. - Y'all seen Melvin? - I ain't seen that motherfucker. You ain't seen that motherfucker? - Who's that? - Melvin. - No. - Shit. Every motherfucking time something going on, this motherfucker gotta disappear. Melvin! There's the motherfucker's bike. And there's the motherfucker's shoe. There's the other shoe. Attached to this ig'nant motherfucker. Melvin! Get your ass up, man! What the fuck is wrong with you? Acting like your ass is homeless and shit. - Stole my shoe? - I found your damn shoe. - Yeah? What's it doing in your hand then? - What the fuck is it doing off your foot? It's sitting right over there. You look like shit. Fuck. I remember the party and then... Man, you left about 4 a.m. Just slipped off into the darkness. Did I dream it or did I get with Caroline? You better hope you didn't get with that fat bitch. She two hundred and fifty pounds. She's kinda foxy though. That fox don't need to eat for another three years. Now, come on, man. - That's better. - You gotta be in court this morning. - What? - You gotta be in court this morning. Why didn't you say that earlier? What the fuck you think I've been trying to say to you? Come on, man. Shit, damnit, Melvin. Riding around town all goddamn morning looking for your ass. - We gotta go man. I gotta change. - Yeah, no shit. - Fuck. - Shit, shower, and shave. Shit, it smell like a pack of horses coming at a motherfucker ass first. How the fuck you end up over here? I mean, you my brother and I love you, but sometimes you do some silly ass shit. Fucking thing! Come on! Man, ride. Complaining about you fuckin' up. The fuck. - Stupid, Melvin. Fucking stupid. - Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Shit. So you had to stay out all night? One of these days. One of these days. One, two, three! Come on! - Shit. - Man, I can do this my goddamn self. - I'm trying to help you, man. - Do it look like I need your help, motherfucker? - You are in a wheelchair, you know? - I ain't no spastic. I never said you were. You want my help or not? One of these days I'm going to get me a new chair that don't need no skinny ass - to push it up ramps. - Will you stop your moaning? One of those carbon fiber motherfuckers that do tricks and shit. Come on, buddy. You know, you look so handsome when you make the effort. I don't understand why you have to dress like a hobo. Come on, Mom. How do I look, Luc? Judge will give you five years for wearing that cheap suit. - Jesus. - Lucille, leave him alone. He looks just like he did on his first day of school. I was just joking, Miss H. The judge is going to dig you, bro. - Alright, you wanna hear my letter? - Why not? Lay it on me. Okay. Dear sir... I know I haven't exactly been the best father to date, but I'm here today to tell you that I can't be a better father if I'm in prison. All I want to do is see my boy again and I'll do whatever you ask me just to spend some time with him. He loves his father and he needs me. And if you give me the chance, I am capable of being a stable and solid influence in his life. Now the charge of kidnapping sounds very extreme to me because it's not in fact what happened. We just wanted to go on a holiday together, me and Rex, is all. Maybe I didn't handle it right, sir. I understand, but my ex is a real pain in the ass... Man, you cannot say that stuff to the judge, man. Yeah, you gotta let the judge decide the rest. Come on, man. Here are your sandwiches in case it goes on a while. - Crust off for Lucille, crust on for you. - Okay, great. Hey, good luck, bro. You look like a fucking hobo in that suit. Thanks, sis. - Love you. - Love you, more. - Boy, what you think about the ride? - It's dope, man. Where'd you get it? Borrowed it from my uncle. You gotta make a good impression on that judge, right? A good impression? What kind of narcotic you on, son? - Thanks for doing this, man. - Anytime! Hey, Miss H, how we looking? - Like The Village People. - Love you, Ma. - Get out of here before you're late. - Thank you, Miss H! - Courthouse. - Be careful. I'm running late. Come on, let's move. You got this, Melvin. You got this. - Alright. - Hey, kick some ass, bro. Good luck, man. Hey, man. What happened? Fucking prick gave me a community service order. He banned all contact with Rex, pending assessment. - At least you didn't go to jail, right? - Yeah, I wanna see my kid, man. Get it? Fuck! - What other way could it have gone? - This stupid bitch. - Don't do it, brother. - Thank you. - No, no, no! - Mel, Mel! Feeling good about yourself, Doreen? Are you gonna tell Rex that you banned me from seeing him? Or are you gonna lie like you normally do and blame it on me? - The judge banned you, not me. - Yeah, 'cause you fucking instructed him. Melvin, do not swear at me, okay? I'm not intimidated by you. - Those days are past us. - Doreen, please. Don't do this to me. You're hurting Rex just as much as you're hurting me. I mean, why do you have to be so cruel? What did I ever do to hurt you so bad? - You need reminding. - Please don't do this. It's done, okay? The judge has passed it down. Yeah, well, when Rex is older, he's gonna hate you for using him to get at me. I am not using him. I just don't want him to live amongst the wreckage that is your life. Look at you! You have no manners and no grace. And I abhor what you've become. Hey. Yeah! That motherfucker George Bush, sent us over to Iraq in '91. 82nd airborne division. I remember that first push. We're going through Boswa. We was tripping. I get hit by this sniper. Motherfucker tagged me from behind. Took out my lower spine. Love you, guys. My wife... she was so ashamed of having a husband that the stank bitch didn't even show up to Fort Brag when they sent my ass home. But Melvin did. Him and his momma. Told me I could stay with them 'til I got my shit together. One of these days he's gonna get his shit together. You know what he said? He said I could stay with him 'til I get back on my feet. What kinda shit is that? Back on my feet. Right. Jump! Shit! You alright, man? I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good! I'm good. Baby, I'm good. - Lucas is here. - What? Lukey! With his spectacles and all. Yeah, Lukey! The motherfucking science teacher. What's up, bro? How you doing, man? Melvin is not like other people. Ever since we were kids, we came to discover he had... abilities to move objects using only the power of his mind. Okay, so... on first glance, if you look at both heads, you don't see anything different. Now... let's look at Melvin's again. Here, we start to notice very small anomalies on the outer sleeve of the brain. That's about the only thing that I see that's different. And I've studied this guy for over a decade. Everything else about him reads normal. I run tests on every other part of his body and found nothing. Now, Mel he comes in from time to time and we check to, you know, to see if his blood clean, his brain is flowing, simple stuff. We don't publicize. We don't talk about anything outside of my laboratory. Truth is, and he don't mind me saying this... and speaking as a professional, he has so much to offer the world of science... and there's so much potential for him. This little light, this little light This little light of mine This little light, this little light This little light of mine This little light, this little light This little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine This little light, this little light This little light of mine This little light, this little light This little light of mine This little light, this little light This little light of mine I'm gonna let it, I'm gonna let it shine Everywhere, everywhere Everywhere I go I'm gonna let it shine, let it shine - Yes, sir! Hallelujah! - Yes, sir! - Nice, reverend! - Yes, sir! Here on this beautiful afternoon, you're about to experience magic. Yes, I say to you, beautiful, magic. You are gonna watch this wheelchair levitate in the air. Yeah! Levitate! But to make this trick successful, I need a dollar. Yes, I ain't say thirty-five cents and no, I didn't say no fifty-five cents. I need a dollar. Going once. And you, the beautiful in the pink. Thank you so very much. Anyone else? You got one more dollar, brother. Give me that last one. This is the one. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Anybody else? You're gonna watch some magic. I promise you that. Criss Angel ain't got nothing on this trick. Now, here we go! Everyone, are you ready? The best act out of the West Bank. My main man, a hundred grand. Here he is, y'all! That's my boy! That's my boy! He's settling in. It's a part of the meditation. Let the magic man do what the magic man do. Pictures ain't free. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, it is about to go down. Yes! What'd I tell you! Do not try this at home. I need a dollar. I need a dollar. Anybody else? Come on, come on. That's what I'm talking about. Come on! You see, that's magic. Give it up for him, y'all! Melvin! The kitchen furniture moves you're doing, please can you put it back? Yeah, Mom, I'm playing the piano here. Please put the table and chairs back where they belong. You know I don't love you touching my stuff. Coming. Thank you. And the lamp. - What is up with you, love? - Nothing. Hey, Melvin? My curling iron, it's shorted. So? Is that my problem? Yeah, actually it is your problem. It's you're fucking fault. You, language. Do you see my hair? Do you want me to go see Ryan like this? Really? Ryan or not, you do not curse in this house. Okay. Well, you know what? Thanks a lot, Melvin. You're a dick. - Can't wait to meet, Ryan. He sounds lovely. - Fuck off. - Are you feeling okay? - Sure, Mom. Never better. I've been living here about thirty-five years. I seen all kinda changes, but nothing to compare to Katrina. She just come along and blew everything away. We gets all kinda hurricanes around these parts. But we ain't never seen nothing like her before. Man, the Lord was angry. People was floating along the streets. Dogs! Families standing on rooftops... Crying 'cause they ain't gots no home no more. My old man, he a booze hound, he been on the ward for years. And my boy, Deon... he in the pen. So me? I gots no one to help me. So I sank to my knees and I asked the Lord to help me. The Lord come. Melvin. Melvin, that's what! He showed up when the storm was raging and I was cowering in my kitchen like a kicked dog, roof clean gone. And he led me out to safety. Storm passed, sun came out... wind died down. I come home... my roof is on. How... how you gonna explain shit like that? The brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness. And Kurtz's life was running swiftly, too. And Kurtz's life was running swiftly, too. Genius. As Conrad got older, he wrote less. He eventually settled in England. Didn't care much for public scrutiny or adoration. Guess he just wanted to be out in the country by himself. Like Conrad, Mom was a reclusive writer as well. Listen to this. The day broke gray and dull. God! I mean, I wish I could come up with shit like that. Instead, I look out the window and I think, oh, fuck! It's raining. Here, there's something else I wanna read you. Fuck off. One day, I was like I guess maybe... it was right before Katrina. Actually, it was a little ways before Katrina. This fucking family shows up in the neighborhood, right? And it's fucking Mel and his mom and his fucking smoking hot sister. And this black guy in a wheelchair, named fucking Lucille. And fucking Mel, he does this weird ass trick, where he likes stacks up these quarters, okay? It's like just sitting there still and all of a sudden he starts doing this shit and the quarters start lifting up, right? And they start separating. And I was like... looking at Lyle, we're both like, what the fuck, man? Now, we're just like fucking boys, I mean. Lucille, Mel, Lucas, Lyle, me, we're like family. You know what I mean? - How much you got, Lyle? - Eighty dollars. - Shit, get as much as you can get. - Think I got enough for that... - Quarter? - Alright, man. See if they'll roll one up for me. I don't like rolling motherfucker. These niggas ain't got nothing better to do. You don't know how to roll. Yo, what's up, Nate? You got some weed for me, bro? You know it. Hey, holla at my man, Ramone, right there. What's going on, bro? If it ain't black-man and Robin. What's happening? Sup, cuz? Cat got your tongue? We ain't related, nigga. And don't be calling your cuz. We might be related considering I banged your momma. Big baller, shot caller? Hey, come on. Get that little crippled motherfucker up out of here talking that shit. You got it, dude. Well, get it the fuck up out of here then, dude. - Okay, man. - This C-block, cuz. - Nate, man, I appreciate it brother. - No doubt. I hate having to kiss that motherfucker, Nathan's ass just for a couple joints. Damn, man. Hey, who got shot? Remember that kid who used to be dribbling around with that basketball. - Yeah. - Got wasted off a crack rock, Luc. Dealed from that motherfucker, Nathan. If I wasn't in this motherfucking chair, I'd beat all the black off that motherfucker. He'd be a Caucasian in about five minutes. I'll tell you that right now, shit. - Feel that? - Yeah. I can make you come with my finger. Imagine what I could do with my tongue. Hunny? - Fuck off. - What? Jesus, you're a train wreck. You mind giving the man in the chair a shot? I am so sorry, honey, but I have a man. What rap they get you on, kid? I'm talking to you. What'd you do? Why'd you get community service? I set my school on fire. Smoke weed? If life gets you down, it's not a bad thing to try. Always helped me. Here. Sunny, Florida. Rex is still a baby there. He won't even remember that one. First day at school. Notice, how the mother isn't featured. My old man he split when... when I was just a kid. I'm not about to let that happen to Rex. Fuck you. Care for a mint? Give me that motherfucker. - You look a little peaky, Mel. - No, I'm just tired, dude. Really? Here we go. You're trying to scare me now? I'm just saying is all. You look like you could use rest. But I'm charting okay though, right? It's not what they're saying, it's what I'm saying. You know, one day, it won't hurt if you saw professional help 'cause I really don't have a clue what I'm looking for. No doctors, buddy. You know that. Yeah, they're people out there that know a lot more than me. I'm a science teacher in a local college. Doesn't make me any great authority. God handing out all the gifts. I'm stuck in this damn chair. Yeah, but you got me. That ain't no damn consolation prize. - So, we done here or what? - Yeah. - Sweet. - Lucas. Let me get a couple of them pills you gave me last time for the pain. - No, Lu. Mel. - Hey, hey. Lucas, you got two of these. Can I have one? Give a nigga a lab coat and he think he a doctor. He's getting pissed. Thank you, doc. - Take care of yourself, okay? - Yeah, I'm good, man. Chill. Ten across with the A in the middle. Annihilation. Motherfucker. How you know that shit? Just a guess. What's next? Alright, seven down with the same A in the middle. - Anomaly. - Anoma, what? Anomaly! It's like a one-off, like me. Man, you ain't no one-off. You a circus freak. That's funny coming from you. - Yeah, I got put here. - Yeah, you think I chose? Man, you ain't got nothing but choices. All you choose to do is smoke weed and chase cat. Jimmy! What up, Jimmy? - Hey, what it look like? - You get a haircut? Look at him. Cleaner than the board of health. Butch. Sundance. We ain't doing that, Jimmy. We just chilling. Come on, Melvin. Put it out. Show a little respect for Christ's sakes. - It's a joint, man. I mean... - I see that. - Here, man. - Thank you, Lucille. Not a problem. You know what kills me? - Smoking? - No. What kills me is that you're out here every day doing the same thing. Getting high, drinking beers like there's no tomorrow with Cool Runnings over here. - That shit ain't funny. - That was funny. When what you could be doing is taking responsibility amongst your community. I've seen the things you can do, Melvin. It's no secret around here. You got a gift. But you're wasting it. You ever thought about helping out? You know? Hell, maybe create a nicer environment for your son to grow up in. There's something to think about. What is this? National pick on Melvin day, Jimmy? No, it's national get your shit together day... and I say that because I care. Tell that motherfucker again 'cause son of a bitch don't listen to me. And don't be calling me Cool Runnings. - I'm on it, Jimmy, alright? I'm on it. - Yeah, on what? Since Amelia? I'm gonna work on it, okay? You got my word. Give me some time, alright? I'll get my shit together. Oxycodone. Semi-synthetic, slow release painkiller first synthesized by eminent pharmacologists, Freund and Speyer, in Germany in 1916. I'm a fan. I'm gonna show you some crimes scenes. Third story up, I knew these guys were robbing the place. Their car was sitting here, engine running. These two knuckleheads jump down, they jam into their car. They spot me. One guy comes at me... crack! I put him over the hood. Next guy, starts waving some screwdriver at me. Relieved him of that. Put him down. Done. All units, we got a 211 in progress on Atlantic Boulevard. Get them, Lyle. Come on, man. Let's move! The old Vicodin. Heavy, opiate narcotic to treat severe pain. It's the most widely prescribed prescription medication in this country. Over 140 million prescriptions of this drug alone. And I'm proud to say that I'm not one of those people. Why? Because I steal mine. Come on, Lyle! I chase down the guys that cops don't have time to deal with. Junkies, small time criminals. You gotta be careful. A desperate man can be a dangerous man. These guys? Fucking amateurs. Fucking robbed the store for sixty some odd dollars. What is wrong with these people? Yeah, they're crooks, but they have a bit of initiative they're showing. And I like that 'cause they're not just sitting around waiting for a fucking handout. That's the problem with this country. You gotta bunch of lazy motherfuckers sitting on their fat asses with a begging bowl in one hand and McDonald's in the other. Yeah, they're criminals, but at least they're trying. What? I was ready to love the whole fucking world. But no one understood me! Nobody! So I learned to hate. You think I'm the one to set things straight? Look at me, man. Wrong. Fuck. No, no, no. Talented and astute, but lazy. Likely to understand everything and even accomplish something. He had nonetheless been content to enjoy life as a spectator. Maupassant, I dig you, man. I dig you! Get off! Oh, my God! Mom, look. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - What happened? - You okay? I was out or what? Yeah, you were out. Let me go get somebody. - Hey, man. - Hey, Mom. - How you doing? - You're gonna be okay. What happened? Let me see. Melvin was being Melvin. Melvin can do anything. Melvin think he can fly. Melvin think he can drink a whole liquor store. Melvin jump off cliff. Hurt when hit ground. That's pretty much what happened, man. - How you doing? - How are you feeling? You just woke up? - Yeah, what is this thing? - This just checks your heart rate. You went into cardiac arrest so we're just monitoring you right now. - You gonna be his nurse today? - Yes, sir. - Can you by my nurse tomorrow? - Sure. Alright. That's what I'm talking about. I got a little pain down below and, you know... He's been dead for a while. I was wondering if you could bring him back to life, you know... a little mouth to mouth resuscitation would help me right now. - Stop, don't listen to that. - We apologize for him. - That's okay. We get that all the time. - I was just having fun with you, girl. Just being serious. Sir, is your full name Melvin Hesper? That's me, doc, but call me Mel. We cannot seem to find any medical records on you. Any type of history? - I never go to the hospitals. - Never? Never broke a bone, a bad flu, anything? What about medical insurance? Are you covered? Why would I be covered if I don't go to hospitals? These scars, they look like gunshot wounds. What can you tell me about them? - They're gunshot wounds. - That's very funny. How did you get them? A gun. Tell me about this one. This? It's nothing. Just some cap stuck me a few years back. You didn't get medical help? I don't have insurance, doc. Sir... you just suffered a serious cardiac arrest. Your heart stopped beating for several minutes. You were certified dead. Look, we're gonna need to keep you under observation for at least forty-eight hours. Our preliminary tests produced some particularly interesting results that may be personal to you. Lying there in the hospital, I realized something. I got it all wrong. I've been a total asshole. - You on some kind of narcotic, nigger? - No, I'm being serious. I got a gift here, man. I gotta start using it. Use it for the good. I'm gonna change. I'm gonna start fighting crime, not committing it. - I've been saying that shit for years. - I know. I wasn't ready to listen, okay? But lying there with my whole life flashing in front of me, it came to me. I'm gonna do whatever it takes for Rex. No more drinking. No more weed, pills. I'm even gonna stop cigarettes. Pussy, cheating, hustling, stealing. I'm even thinking about stopping jerking off. - Yeah, I wouldn't go that far. - No... - Maybe that's a bit too much. - Yeah, that's too much. Shit. From this day forward... I'm going straight, brother. I am. Well, alright. I'll tell you what, I'm with you, Melvin. Melvin, this is your calling. What you got is a gift. It's from the heavens. So is Rex, brother. So is Rex. Fuck. It's okay. He got the plan inside his hand. Understand that he's the man. Each and every time abide the sign. Press the rewind in your own mind. Kick it one more time. Hey, Mel. Can you bend his mouth to shut up? See he got the master plan inside his hand Understand that he's the man, got the plan Surprise. - You gotta be kidding me. - Drink it. It's robiatic. It's what? - Healthy. - You mean macrobiotic. Whatever, man. Just drink the shit. It's good for you. I can't drink this shit, man. I'll start voting green peace and dating guys. Alright. It's good. You know, I read this book about health. I put some celery in there. They said to clean out the lungs, you know, reduces mucus. And you'll spit all that tarred-nicotine from them cigarettes out. And then I put some ginger in there that'll clean out the blood stream. Help get all that alcohol and whatever else you been putting up your damn nose. And you gonna piss a lot. Just understand that. - But that's a good thing. - I taste the ginger. Yeah, it got a little heat on it. I put some rhubarb in there, too. - Rhubarb? - Rhubarb. Yeah. - What the hell is rhubarb? - It clears the mind. It's a root. - I know. Yeah, yeah. - I ain't put no voodoo or nothing on this. It's just to clean you out. Yeah! One more, one more. Come on, champ. I care about you, brother. I wanna see you get better. I wanna see you do better. Thanks, buddy. - We was fourteen? - We was twelve actually. Yeah, just about to turn thirteen. We met in California. I hadn't seen my boy for some years and then I come back and he's able to do all this stuff like, you know... make spoons move across the table and shit like that. You know. Black people don't usually, you know, get along with that kinda stuff. That's why you don't see a lot of black people at magician shows. 'Cause they think it's like voodoo and the devil. Yeah, I remember I called you and I was like, where's Lucille? I asked your mom, and she said, Melvin, he's... he's gone. He's in the military. - I said, what? What the fuck? - Slap him. Slap him. Two peas and a biscuit. Two peas and a biscuit. Hit that motherfucker. Drop the bitch. I left dodging bullets and ending up dodging more bullets. And one of them got me. You have no idea what's in that box of yours, do you, motherfucker? That's what I'm talking about. Muscle memory. Like riding a bike. You don't know what you're made of 'til you test that heart. Put it to the test. What he can do around these neighborhoods, around the world, around the country with that gift, could fix a whole lot of shit. - What the fuck! - Sorry! - What the hell just happened? - Hey, pipe down. - We're training over here, motherfucker. - Fuck. I knew he was paralyzed, you know. I mean, he told me that. You know, I didn't quite know how I was gonna handle it, but my main thing was I was gonna treat him as I always treated him. As my equal, as my friend, and as my brother. Fuck. Lucille, this is some heavy shit, man. Five more. It's that green juice, man. That shit taste nasty, but it's doing something. It's something else. It's running through my blood. It's a new energy. I don't know what it is. It's scary, man. Don't be scared of it. Let it flow. You doing this shit again, ain't you? See? He can do anything, man. Anything. That's what I'm talking about, Melvin. You getting back to yourself. Look like you did when you was in your twenties? That's right. Stop showing off, motherfucker. - Are you sure this is the block, or... - Yeah, man. She come this way all the time. Wait 'til you see her. What? I'm just looking at you. Is that a problem? - You looking at me like you don't believe me. - Of course I believe you. You said you see her every day, she's obviously late. Just give it a little time, man. Give it a little time. Something that fine need a little time. It's like wine. You know, we could just come back another day, too. It's no big deal. Damn. I really thought I had a shot with this one, man. You may, Luc. Come on. Maybe she's sick. She's at home. She... You'll find her. - Man, fuck it, man. Come on. Let's go. - Really? - Yeah, man. Fuck it. - You done? - What? - There she is. Fuck. Which one is she? The one that don't look like a water buffalo. Stop laughing, man. They looking. They looking. Chill. Chill. - Hey, ladies, what's cracking? - What you doing? Just chilling, baby. - What's your name, baby girl? - Yolanda. - Yolanda. I like that. - Thank you. Tell you what, Yolanda. If I could impress you, would you let me call you one time? You gonna impress me? Knock yourself out. How the hell you do that? Walking is the only thing I can't do, baby. You feel me? It's 717... - I'm listening. - 21... - 82. - That's what I'm talking about. Bye. I just love watching you walk. - Stop. - You look good coming and going. Thank you. Did you get the number, man? I knew your ass was good for something, motherfucker. - She is beautiful, Luc. - I wasn't bullshitting, was it? Hell no. She's fine. Man, I'll tell you, I'll wait out here fifteen hours for that. Shit, she just looked back. Don't look. Don't look. - Alright. - Just be cool. We should just peel out of here. Yeah, she's looking all the way. - Don't look anxious, right? - No, we gonna go the opposite way. - We can't be, you know... - I'm in there then, shit. You see that ass? Like a motherfucker. Shit, I'ma put her ass in a wheelchair. Shit. Two years? Jesus. - Hey. - Yo! - Where's the man? Where's Danny? - He's inside. Let me go get him, brother. - Danny. - Yeah? The boys are here. Shit. - Danny boy! - Motherfuckers. Welcome home, man. - Come here, man. God damn. - What's up, brother? - Ain't nobody tamper with you, did they? - No, no, no. - Mel? - I'm good. Taking the night off. - Don't be a pussy, man. Let's drink. - Yeah. He just got out of the joint. Hey, the motherfucker's in training. Won't you two just chill the fuck out? Just trying to make some changes. What? It's my first night back, man. I thought we was gonna roll all night. - We are, man. I'm hanging! - You're hanging. What the fuck you talking about, hanging? I've been away two years. You're gonna hang my first night back? Man, the brother is getting his life together for Rex. - No shit. - Yeah, man. - You doing it for your boy? - I am. Good on you then, brother. I'm proud of you. - You're a good man, Mel. - Yeah. I, however, am not a fucking good man. And if I wake up alive tomorrow, I'm gonna consider this night a motherfucking waste. I probably won't remember none of this shit anyway. - He never remembers shit. - Don't take too long, guys. - Come on up. - I gotta try, man. That's all. I gotta try. - It's fucking good to see you, brother. - You too. - It's good to see you, too, Luc. - Hell yeah, that's good. Let's get to seeing some ass right here. You see that right there? That's what's good to see. Time to ride. Hey, what up, homie? Hey, holla at your boy. That's what's good. You straight? You staying out of trouble? Alright, man. Stay out of trouble, man. You know what this is? - I don't know. You tell me. - It's sober hand. Okay. I'm sober. When I was in the hospital, I did a lot of thinking. All the things you were saying. Lucille's been telling me for years. And I'm ready. I'm ready to do some good in this community. Is that why you show up to crime scenes and relieve the suspects of their stolen goods? Come on, man. That was then, this is now. I've been through something. No fucking around. I wanna help you. Really? Ready to take on that responsibility? Yes. Tell me what you want me to do. I always knew you'd be the one, Melvin. Your natural abilities, the shit you can do. I've known you for years. It's still amazing. Hey, what's up, bitches? That's the shit I'm dealing with every goddamn day. You know that motherfucker peddles rock and smack to kids not much older than your son. Yeah, I know. That's why I'm here. Thanks, Jimmy. Thanks for believing in me, buddy. Be careful with Nathan. He's a dangerous motherfucker, man. Alright. - You ready? - Yeah, I got this. - Melvin. - Shit. I'm sorry, man. You... you are not as ready as you think you are. What the hell you doing here? What you want? Where's Nathan at? You know you don't belong around here so take your ass home. Get Nathan down here now. Say what, now? So you giving me orders? - Get the fuck out of here before you get hurt. - I'm not moving. - Maybe this'll help you. - Yeah? Go for it. Make your move. Make your fucking move. What you got? You got a piece back there? Bring it. - Man, how the fuck you do that? - You tell Nathan I wanna see him. Anytime, anywhere. Bunch of fucking pussies, hurting kids. This is just a small way of saying welcome to our home, Ryan. It's Melvin's favorite cake. I'm really thrilled that he has decided to make certain positive changes. - Come on, Mom. Please? - Mom, that is embarrassing. Stop. Thank you so much for welcoming me into your lovely home, Miss Hesper. Melvin, would you like to personally greet Ry? Love to. You hurt my sister, I'm gonna break your fucking jaw. - Melvin, language. - I'm just kidding you, buddy. Sorry, Ryan, let me just apologize for my mentally handicapped brother - who's a total dick. - Ryan. How hungry are you feeling? It certainly looks delicious. I'll take a healthy size piece. Thank you very much. You do have lovely manners. I appreciate a young man who knows how to say please and thank you. And where's your delightful accent from? I'm originally from Oklahoma, Miss Hesper. - Well, please call me Eileen. I insist. - Stop it. No, me and the kid's father, we went up to Oklahoma once. It was... - What the hell is going on? - Seriously, can you stop? And we were in this like yellow Cadillac. And it was just so much fun. - What the fuck! - Ryan, language please. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Stop showing off. Well, great. Thank you. Thanks, Melvin. I swear to God, you are such a penis! What? I thought that went rather well. I liked him. She liked him. I'm playing around, Mom. Jesus. One evening where we could just sit as a family and have a nice little piece... Come on. I'm just... Fuck. Hey, man. Where the fuck are you going now? It's Lucille. What is he? I don't know. I have no way of explaining it. - Where's 167? - Right there. Look, Mel, man, you need to leave. You can't be around us, man. - How is he? - How is he? Nathan walked up and stuck a bullet in him 'cause of something you did, man. Just walked up and shot the cat outside my place. - I'm sorry, Luc. I am so sorry, bro. - Hey, Mel, listen, man. If you're really sorry, the best thing you can do is leave, bro. - Yeah, just get the fuck it. - Fuck you, Lyle. - This is between me and Lucille. - But it's not between you and Lucille anymore. It's between all of us. You're the one who brought us into this thing. - You need to walk away. - He's right. I mean, you started a war we can't fight, bro. Hey. Hey! - Promise me. - Mel, look what you got us into. Luc, talk to me. Let me take care of you, brother. Get the fuck out, Melvin. Alright. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Melvin. Hey, Jimmy. I thought you were giving up the drink. Some things change, I guess. You want a drink? No. Gotta get going. Just wanted to say hello. Alright, Jimmy. Take her easy. Lucille. Lucille! What the fuck you want? I'm sorry. Man, keep your damn voice down. I'm sorry. You're drunk ain't you, motherfucker? God damn, Melvin. I'm not talking to your ass while you're drunk. - Just let me inside. - Get the hell away from my house, man. I'm tired of seeing you like this, bro. I love you, man. Yo! Hey. What's up, Mel? You look like shit. - What's going on? - Just wanna hang, man. - Who is it? - It's Melvin. What does he want? I don't want that motherfucker, Nathan, showing up here. Anybody follow you here? Yeah, these babies. - How's he look, man? - He's wasted. - Really? Did he bring any friends? - Brought a whole fucking bag full of 'em. You wanna party, Mel? - Get your ass up here, man. - What a fucking privilege. Fucking A. We got our old Melvin back. - Let's call someone. - Hey, man, we'll call lots of people. Shit. - I'm happy to see you, man. - I'm happy to see you, too, brother. - Did they fuck with you in there? - A little bit, man. - Sexually, no? - Fuck you, man. I don't know... If it wasn't for Lucille, maybe you'd be one of my best friends. - Fuck being sober! - To being fucking back. When are the bitches showing up? - Fuck all this bullshit. - Danny, where you going? I'm putting music on. I gotta pee. - She was fat. - No way. She wasn't fat. Just 'cause a chick got big hips and a big ass doesn't make her fat. - If she got fat hips and a fat ass... - Did you see the size of those fucking tits? Those are motor boating tits. Those are good tits. - Good tits for you. - You should did her. It's the reason why we're running late now. Fucking liquor store's probably not even open thanks to you... Yo, Mel. Is that you, motherfucker? Kiss my ass, Melvin. Fuck you, man! I ain't no bitch! - Holy shit. - Yo, let's go! - Are you hit, man? - No. You alright? - Guys, we gotta get the fuck out of here. - Just take me to Lucas's. - Dude, what's wrong, bro? - It's my heart. Just get me there. Fuck. Mel. Mel, this is... this is crazy. I don't have a clue what I'm looking for. You really need to see a specialist. I'll be alright. - I just need to rest. - But you're not alright. The more you're using your abilities, the more it's hurting you. Yeah? Thought you said you weren't a specialist? Mel, look, I... I wanna help... but I'm not comfortable with this. Son of a bitch. You son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. You about done playing this game, motherfucker? Yeah, man. How's the arm? I've had worse. It's good to see you. Likewise, man. I worry about you. Come here, Ma. Everything's gonna be alright. Impressed? - So? - Brother... you the only motherfucker I know that'll turn a Porsche into a Nissan and still feel good about himself. - Hey, Jimmy. - Hey. - How's Lucille holding up? - He's good. He's doing better. - That's good. - Listen... Just wanted you to know it's gonna get noisy at C-block later. You need me? When you get the call... ignore it. I got this. Thanks, Jim. Chopin, Vagner, Beethoven, Mozart. You know what they all have in common? They're Europeans, man. I mean, those cats had so much history and culture to draw from when they wrote. That's why their concertos are still amazing to this day. I mean, listen to that. The changes, the notes, the way it prociendos. It's perfect. I fucking love it. We're here. It's hot as a motherfucker out here today. Alright, man. Let's go. - Shit. - What the fuck? Man, what the fuck, man? Shit, all the shit's coming out. Take it and put that shit in there.

I remember playing this when I was a kid. I love seeing you run. Here I come! I heard something happened to that motherfucker Nathan. I think he got the message. I got somewhere I wanna take you. Where is that? You gotta know everything. - Man, I'm playing like a salad up here. - A what? A salad. Getting tossed all over the damn place. Gotta do something about these roads. I gotta get me a new set of legs that work. Yeah, or a new chair that works. Ain't nobody gonna buy me a new chair, my brother.
