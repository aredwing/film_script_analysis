And when you come, you must become wild and beautiful. So I can see it through a crack in the door.. Then I'll see you, as if you're riding a horse. leaning back, dancing in the saddle. Sparks flying from your horse'shooves. A spark hits my skin, my heart. And then I shoot the arrow. From my tight bow, I almost hit you. My target, your red gate. As it flows in the foamy sea... Come on, come on. Take me into your mouth. You see, here is a scene from the Book of Daniel out of the Old Testament, Susanna, when she bathed in the garden. is attacked by the two older... Nice of you to pay us a visit. - Sorry. ...will fall and she is faced with the choice... Could you hurry upand sit down? And faced with the choice break them with their marriage, or be sentanced to death. Because Susanna chooses death, she is rescued. The two judges are sentanced to death because of the temptations Babylon was corrupt. Wait for me. Blub blub. Where were you? I've called you three times. I was OK. The rubber tasted horrible.

If he comes quickly, I can still get to the University. I must go. Bye bye. So, the next is Nathalie Merchant. I love the water. It's dense opacity. The green in the water and the dumb creatures. And I'm now lost for words. My hair is amongst them, in them. just the water. the equally valid mirror it forbids me to see you differently. The wet line between me and myself. Thank you Goodbye.
