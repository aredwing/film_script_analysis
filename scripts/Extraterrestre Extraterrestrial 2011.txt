NO SIGNAL Last night everything|fell out of my pocket and I'm missing a two euro coin. It's only two euros.|You can pay next time. Don't worry about it. Here. Anyway... Can I have some coffee? It's burning. Thanks. You're welcome. I'm sorry but something urgent|came up... Do you mind if I make a call? There's something wrong with my cell,|there's no coverage. This isn't working either. Hold on. Mine has no coverage either. What time does yours say? - Just past 7:30.|- Just past 7:30? Yeah, the day got away from us. Listen, I really need to be alone.|I'm sorry. No one around, at this time?|Even on a Sunday... Has something happened?|Did you hear anything? None of the channels are working. It's been like that since I got up. What about the internet? ...in a state of emergency. Please stay calm|and remain in your homes until emergency crews arrive. Contact them and follow|their instructions. Thank you. Holy shit! What is that? A temporary evacuation is underway... There, out back. - Got any binoculars?|- No. ...until emergency crews arrive. The camera... This is a message|from the Department of Defense. - This is the zoom, right?|- Yeah. How big is it? Look, it's turning very slowly. Yeah. I think I can figure it out.|If I time how long it takes to turn I can work out its size.|Got a calculator? Yeah, you want it? Yes, please. Hey, excuse me... - Julio.|- Oh, I'm Julia. What a coincidence. I don't know why I thought|your name was Luisa. After last night no wonder|I can't remember... By the way, where did we meet? Aren't you worried|about anybody? I guess I should call my family,|they're all in Badajoz. If the phones are working later. You must have somewhere to go. Yeah. Yeah, my apartment. I live in Hortaleza. I'm renting a room|from some friends of my parents. I can leave if you want. No, wait till I find the calculator. Should I leave after that? No... Sorry, what was the calculator|for again? There's somebody there. Hi. - Angel.|- Hi. This is...|What was your name again? Julio. I'm Julia, what a coincidence. He's a friend... I think you were right|to stay home. People were so quick to take off. Where could be better|than right here? Is there anyone else|left in the building? Actually, I don't know. Trucks showed up around nine|with the military and they organized the cars into lines.|I think everyone left but... I don't really know|because I didn't open the door. I watched TV all day|until it stopped working. Is your internet working? What have you been doing all day?|Didn't you hear me ringing? Where did they take everyone? I don't know, the suburbs,|the mountains... Not far, because|there are more there. More what? More ships.|Don't you know what's going on? Angel, is your internet working? Worldwide they don't know, but in Spain|more than 30 have appeared. Especially over the cities. Have you been in bed all day?|I tried ringing the bell... How did you know she was here? What? Why didn't you think|she'd left with the others? Because Julia always parks her car|in front of mine. And it was there this morning,|that's how. But you said you didn't go outside.|How did you see it? From the window? Yes. No. My internet isn't working. No... Anyway... I'm going... to the bathroom. No, I'm leaving. I'll call you later, Julia. I think it's almost... Nobody's seen anything|coming out, right? Well, I think they come down from the middle.|That's why we can't see them from here. What's up with your neighbor?|Is he always so transparent? What? It's obvious he stayed|because he saw your car and knew you hadn't left, right? How do you know|about all this stuff? I'm an industrial designer. Actually, I haven't finished my degree, but I work making signs,|drawings, models... I'm working on something amazing. Some friends of my parents...|Well, the ones I'm renting from... They're going to be in a parade|in their neighborhood and they asked me to make this. It's a float, something like this. Well, more or less, okay? And they want a car to pull the float, but what I did was put the car inside it. Sorry, I'm really tired. I'm going to bed. See you tomorrow. It's okay, it's me. - What's wrong? What time is it?|- It's late, almost morning. I was looking at the ship and I thought, shit.|Anything can happen anytime. Yeah. I thought we could take turns|keeping watch. Don't worry, I'll go first, okay? But what happened? No, it's just in case. I'll wake you up|if something happens, okay? - Where are you going?|- The living room, stay there. No, I'm not sleepy. - Quick, get up.|- What's going on? - Are they attacking?|- Get washed. Carlos! Julia. Where have you been? They were taking people|to El Escorial... Sweetheart, I'm so glad you're here. They were taking people to El Escorial|and you weren't there... but there were people|from this neighborhood. I called and you didn't answer.|And since you had gone out... By the way, I'm not alone. Hi. Carlos, this is... - Sorry, what was your name?|- Julio. What a coincidence!|Like me. - Hi, Julio.|- Hi. Feeling any better? Yeah. You're lucky Julia saw you from the window. If you'd blacked out|one street up, nobody'd have seen you. - I almost did last night.|- What happened? I walked here from El Escorial.|Eight and a half hours. It got dark at Ciudad Universitaria.|I spent the night in a tent until some jerks woke me up,|screaming like crazy all night and breaking windows.|Nothing happened but it was scary. What's this?|Did you draw it? Yeah, I'm a designer. Have a seat. Julio was drawing|what he saw outside for me. It's good. Damn, it's spot on.|I know people who've seen it closer up and showed me photos|but you can't see shit. What's that? Holy shit! I heard about a weird car|driving around. It sounded like a military vehicle,|but this is something else. This is serious, damn it! Where did you see it? Out there. Here? On this street? I didn't see anything.|This is... I saw it. It drove right past. I described it|and this looks a lot like it. Nice going, Julio. - Good work.|- Thanks. - Shit, you could have told me...|- I know, I'm sorry. I'd have left right away|and saved you the trouble. I put my foot in it. I don't know what to say.|I'm sorry. What are you doing? I'm leaving. You're leaving? I'm in the way. No, you're not.|With all the mayhem out there... You might black out again.|Come inside. Angel stayed behind too. You don't say. We can't get rid of that guy,|not even with UFOs. Come in. Hi, Angel.|Come by for dinner later! The military has fenced off the area|right under the ship. Apparently people have seen|some crazy stuff out there. Anyway, besides that weird tank Julia saw|I don't believe any of it. You saw a weird tank? Yeah, I have a drawing of it|in there. If they brought huge ships all this way,|there must be a reason, right? They'll do something. Maybe... Look, I don't mean to scare you, but I overheard two cops talking|at a highway checkpoint and it's been on my mind|ever since. Maybe they're already doing something but in a way that we don't realize. I think... Maybe they're invisible. Maybe they can fit in among us|without us noticing. But shouldn't we leave? There are ships everywhere. I think... At least we're someplace|we can control. Well, I think that's pretty lame. They come here in flying devices|bigger than towns and suddenly they're worried about|being noticed? It makes no sense. What do you think then?|Let's hear it. I think they're testing humans to see what we're like,|how we react, if we're intelligent, if we're brave...|They're probably watching us and all the people fleeing|are making fools of themselves because there's no need.|I'll pass. Then those of us staying home|are doing the right thing. We'll get a prize. You'll get a prize. Carlos, help me with this. - No, they're here to stalk us.|- I hope not. Because our neighbor|has that covered. - Carlos.|- I'm coming. Get the peaches I brought,|they're tasty. I put them in the fridge. What? What? What's the problem? What do you mean? No, what's wrong with you? Nothing's wrong with me. What's with that face? What's with what face? Come on, I can tell. You can tell what? That you're jealous. Jealous of what? You can tell I'm jealous of what? That you're into her|and you haven't screwed her. Oh, yeah? And why should I be jealous? You know exactly why.|You must have heard us fucking or something. Don't give me that look|like you didn't know. You knew, stop pretending. You didn't know? Try to open this. My hands are wet. Let me see if I can... We're short on food.|We can check the neighbors' apartments.|I think the supermarket out back stayed open. In the worst case we can plant|something on the terrace. What do you think, Angel? Should we plant lettuce? Maybe the spacemen|will give us diplomas. Carlos... Shit! Damn. - It's nothing.|- Are you sure? Damn it! I'm really sorry.|Does it hurt? Next time aim the other way|and hold it tighter. I can't stand that guy. Sometimes I wish he'd fuck her to see|if he'd calm down and leave us alone. Julia? Hard to believe I thought|he was a snooty homo at first. But you can totally tell|he's into Julia. You can tell, you can tell... Angel, nothing happened!|Don't make things up! Nothing happened! Thanks for dinner.|See you tomorrow. I'm going to bed too. Wake up! Is it my turn? No more turns. You're leaving. Leaving? Why am I leaving? How could you tell Angel that?|How dare you! What did I tell him? You know exactly what you told him. No, I don't. You and I never had sex, okay? I know we didn't.|What are you talking about? Hypocrite. You're lecturing me on sincerity?|You of all people. Where will I go?|It's cold. Let me eat something first,|I'm hungry. Here. Really, Julia, I didn't say anything. Maybe I said something|and he understood whatever he wanted. Who cares anyway? You don't know him.|He's lost his mind. Well, he'll get over it. Last night he said|if I don't tell him, he will. Shit. Come to my place if you want. Wait, wait! Just one thing and I'll leave. But please, listen to me. You win, asshole! Julio... I went to the supermarket. The one you said. Why did you go by yourself? Come in. What the fuck are you doing? - It doesn't fit.|- What doesn't? Angel. He said he never left|his apartment, but he knew your car was parked|in front of his, right? Yeah, so what? It turns out his car|is the one that isn't there. You mean it was stolen? Who'd steal that crate?|At least parked next to yours... What are the chances everybody|would leave the building except him? Telling us some crazy story|and watching us the whole time... And the strangest thing... What scares me the most... What? I swear to god I didn't tell him|anything about us. What do you mean? There's something strange about Angel,|we can't trust him and I think Carlos should know|right away. Julio! You didn't bring|an extension lead, did you? What? Did you see how he reacted|to what you said last night? About them being among us?|He freaked out. Okay, are you guys telling me|there's a chance the Angel next door|isn't the Angel we know? I don't know him at all, but he seems very weird to me,|a troublemaker. I don't know about you guys... What did he say to you last night? At dinner, when you two were alone. Before he took off all of a sudden. He said something to you.|It's been troubling you ever since. That you've been acting strangely. That there's something odd|about you. I said I didn't believe him,|of course. That's why he took off like that. Look, it's unlikely this Angel|is not the real Angel... but we can't take any chances. Hey, what's up? Hi. Did you take the peaches|with you last night? No, I left them here. I don't see them anywhere. I didn't take them. - Hi.|- Hi. Are you calling me a liar? What? Are you calling me a liar? Why would you lie to me? I don't know, you tell me. Carlos, I don't understand. Why do you say|I'm acting strangely? That's what you told Julia|when you were alone, right? That I'm acting strangely. Isn't that what he said? Come here! Come here! Grab him, Julio! Julio! Julio! Grab him! Grab him! I've got him, I've got him! Carlos, Carlos!|Listen to me! Julia's cheating... Let's see what this bastard|has to say for himself. No! I'm scared! Isn't Julia kind of overreacting? About what? Not letting him talk and all that. What's he gonna do, hypnotize us? I don't know. We could ask him why they're here,|what the fuck they're doing here... That weird car Julia saw,|the one you drew... Yeah. Maybe he came in it|and he's got it parked somewhere. - Don't you wanna see it?|- Yeah, sure I do. If he could brainwash us,|he'd have done it by now. Take off his gag. Wait. Come here. Maybe it is the real Angel. So? If it's Angel,|he's bound to go back and tell Julia I didn't listen to her|and let him talk. I'm not gonna let that bastard|give me away. Just untie his hands and feet|and let him go. Angel, if you are Angel...|I hope you understand, okay? I suggest you go to the shopping malls|to the north. There were no people around.|You know the way, right? If you're not Angel... Don't! Don't take off the gag!|Turn around and beat it! You got that? Hi. Isn't it Carlos' turn?|It's early. I couldn't sleep. Yeah. He took out the gun? You got that, motherfucker? Well? There are no bullets,|it's just in case. It's not even loaded. I got it from a sporting goods store|on my way over here. He showed it to you? No, I saw it in his pants. I guess he didn't want to worry me|by taking it out. I guess. This is the first thing|we should have done. I don't know why|I didn't think of it sooner. He's impressive.|He knows what he's doing. If he knew what he was doing,|he'd have thrown you out as well. At least now we know|we got rid of that freak. Thanks for coming back. Those are pages|from a city guide, right? Yeah. It's the best view|of the city. But they're printed|on both sides. How did you manage that? I took two guides from taxis|on the way here. These are the quickest routes. We'll have to make runs.|Julio, this is your apartment? Yeah. You'll need us to pick up|your things. Yeah. What's this line? This is the area cut off|by the military. The whole area under the ship and these are the barricades|I mentioned. Okay. Right, first we'll go through here to pick up the generator for when the power|goes out, which it will. Then we'll look for|a bookstore downtown. We'll need manuals on|telecommunications, electronics, stuff like that.|I'm making a list on the laptop. Who goes with who?|Who stays home? Nobody.|If we go, it's all three of us. Why's that? If Angel wasn't Angel,|what happened to the real Angel? What if one of us gets left alone and they switch us? We stick together, no exceptions! Damn! What? I found a two euro coin! Are you sure? - There are some swings over there.|- Yeah. I wouldn't go near them. When I went by there|I saw some nasty-looking guys. Very dangerous. Seriously, with guns and everything.|They tried to shoot me. You couldn't pay me|to go over there. A gas station. With enough gasoline|we can make a bomb. - But, Carlos...|- There are other ways. A bomb is a bit... I'm not talking about killing anyone. It's just in case|we need to scare someone. We're not that far from home. As long as we don't head that way|we're fine. The water's been cut off. - Already?|- Yeah. We'll have to get more bottles.|Should I wake Carlos up? No. Are there any more|in the kitchen? - Yeah, I'll get them.|- No, I'll go. When you walked by|in the towel earlier... I saw your ass. You did that on purpose, right? What? No way, you're joking.|How can you think that? Come on, you know exactly|when your ass is in view. Especially if there's a guy looking. Well, you're less careful|if he's already seen it. I've already seen it? I thought we agreed|we didn't have sex. We didn't, but you probably|saw my ass. Right. - Are you sure we didn't have sex?|- I don't know. Do you know how the generator works? It's still too dark. Wait until your eyes adjust.|You'll see more. That's it?|This is all we're gonna see? What else do you wanna see? Shit, the power's out. Julia? What? Lower your voice, you'll wake him. Are you still keeping watch? Yeah. Go back to bed. Get some rest.|I'll never get back to sleep anyway. Remind me when we go out tomorrow to get a 300-foot extension lead for the generator.|It's silent... but it's better off|in the stairwell. Or upstairs. We'll find one that's... Carlos, what... "Tune UHF... We're still here." Damn! Carlos? I'm only asking you|for one thing. When I ask you for the paper|don't take half an hour to bring it. Why don't you leave it|on the table? I've told you a thousand times|I don't want any papers on it. I can't be reading a piece of paper. This isn't the news, this is war. Then why keep asking for it? When we're on the air. I don't want it|when we're on the air. We are on the air. - We were, but you stopped.|- No. - You stopped.|- No, we're still on... This bozo claims to speak|for Madrid's refugees? - You stopped, right?|- No, damn it! More lights. We're not the only ones|with a generator. We're not the only ones|watching this. All those people listening to this guy|clueless to the danger we're all in... Carlos, there's no need to exaggerate. I'm being logical, Julio. If they went to the trouble|of trying to fool us, three schmucks in an apartment... won't they try to trick|these people on TV? I'm going to bed. Me too, my head's killing me. By the way, I'll leave the laptop on|so you can check out my notes. See you tomorrow. ...imposed by the government|due to this supposed threat. We're convinced there might be... Already? Sorry. - You know what we can do?|- What? With the cans and the hose... Since the heater isn't working, we can run the hose out the window, roll it up in a circle and the sun will heat the water. That would be nice. I think I can pull it off. Great. - Goodnight.|- Goodnight. Julio! What's wrong? Carlos is gone. He must have gone out for something. Isn't that weird? He's the one|who said we shouldn't separate. - What do you mean?|- I don't know. Did you bolt the door? Julio, I'm scared. Julia, this is insane. It's not so weird|after what happened to Angel... We might have exaggerated a bit|about Angel, don't you think? What do you mean? That we might have exaggerated a bit. You lied about his car, didn't you? No. "Who'd steal that crate?"|you said. How could you know it was a crate|if it wasn't parked there? You mean you knew it was a lie|and you played along? - No, I just realized.|- You're a fake! Manipulator! - Hypocrite!|- Liar! Hello?|Somebody bolted the door. Can you open the door? Hello? Are you guys there? Julia? Hey, open up!|The door's bolted! Carlos, where have you been? I went to find an aerial.|You don't think... Carlos, you said not to separate. I didn't even leave the building.|I didn't... You're right, I'm sorry.|We should have gone together. Son of a bitch! I'm sorry... I'm sorry...|I can't ask you to let me in, especially if I'm upset...|I'm sorry! Carlos... I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Actually, it's what he wanted. To go out and save the world. I don't know why he came back.|Not for me, I assure you. He went to a lot of trouble|to get here. And look how easy it was|to get rid of him. Yeah. You know what I mean. Yeah, I know what you mean. Wanna have sex again? JULIA'S FUCKING JULIO Hey, Carlos! Look!|Read the tennis balls! Carlos, listen!|Julia's fucking Julio! Julia's fucking Julio!|Julia's fucking Julio! Julia's fucking Julio! What the fuck? Julia's fucking Julio!|Julia's fucking Julio! Carlos, look outside!|Check it out! JULIA'S FUCKING JULIO Look what it says! Julia's fucking Julio!|Julia's fucking Julio! Has he always been a jerk? What about you?|Have you always been a homewrecker? What a bastard! Where's Carlos? He left! We're alone! Where did he go? Out to find stuff! He'll be back. The first time I saw Angel, when he came to see you,|he didn't ask about Carlos. Isn't that strange? You know he can't stand him. I know, but... wasn't he surprised|he wasn't with you? Carlos hadn't been around for days. Angel knew we were on the rocks. You two were having problems? Well, problems... I didn't tell you? I thought I told you. We had a crisis. Angel loves it when we fight. Have you had many crises? Of course we have. We've been together since I was 19. Julia, had you ever|cheated on him before? I didn't cheat on him,|this isn't cheating. This is... It's more complicated. No, I never cheated on him before. It's working? Hello? Hi, how did you... Yeah, Julio's here. Okay. - Okay, we're ready.|- Can you hear me? Yes. Hi, Julio. Goddamn it! Hold on. I can see you from here! Get out of there right now! Get out! Okay, I'm back. Quick, you guys can see Columbus|from where you are, right? To the right. Yeah, I think so. Go out on the balcony and look. I think there's an orange building|on the right. Are you looking? Yeah. That was me. Don't worry, the building was empty. - But why?|- Take it easy. Julio, listen to me. I went to your building|in Hortaleza and planted 4 bombs.|I can demolish it too. What? I need you to do something for me. But I need a way to force you,|try to understand. - I'm sorry.|- What do you want? I'll tell you. I need my books, notes, laptop... Everything on the table|in the living room. I need it badly.|I'm kind of in trouble. What's wrong? I took some stuff from the TV guys|and they're after me now. Maybe I went too far|but I don't trust them. - Carlos, please...|- Find somewhere safe in your area to leave them. I'll call you tomorrow at 8 sharp|and you can tell me where. I have a remote detonator so I can|blow up your building anytime, okay? And... well... Julia... What is it? I miss you. I won't stop|until I regain your trust. I'll blow those motherfuckers|back to their saucers if I have to... Carlos! You fucking asshole! Bye. Apparently we're not the only ones|he's threatened. He's been seen causing trouble|at more than one shetler. I mean shelter. Several, in fact. Read the paper. If you see him, and this is my personal opinion... shoot to kill. If you interrupt me again while I'm talking|I'll kick your ass. I swear I'll kick your ass. Just read the paper. I don't want to read it!|I'll stick it up my ass first! You want me to stick it up my ass?|Yeah? Fine, great. Okay, you tape it so everyone|sees me stick this up my ass. We're on the air. - But I said to stop.|- No. - Yes, I did.|- No. - I said to stop.|- No. - Yes, I did.|- No. Good evening. Unfortunately|sometimes danger appears... What do we tell him when he calls? Our facilities have been attacked|by an armed individual... We'll tell him we jumped the gun.|- He's dangerous, irrational... That we were wrong|and to come back. - This is what he looks like.|- Great! You know what I'll tell him?|Julia's fucking Julio! Julia's fucking Julio!|Julia's fucking Julio! I'm going over there. What do we do with him after? What do you mean after? I mean after we throw him out. He's got nothing better to do|than bug us. Who cares if we take away|his tennis ball machine? He's got something much worse. What? All the time in the world. I know a place where he won't bug us|and Carlos won't hear about it. The garage where I work.|I have the keys. We can take him there|and lock him inside. Lock him in a garage? It's big, it's where the floats are. We'll bring him food, and if he|runs out, we'll bring him more. I'm at the door about to... Shit. What's the matter? He blocked it from the inside too.|Damn it. I'll try and... Julio! Julio! Can you hear him screaming?|This ain't water! Fuck! You son of a bitch! If Carlos calls at 8|and I don't give him his stuff... Julio, what is this? Will he do it?|Will he demolish the building? I think so. You said you don't care, right? I don't care about the apartment. Julio, what is this? I've got an idea to get Angel|out of his building. Damn, I should have put wheels on it. - What time is it?|- Almost 8 o'clock. He hasn't called yet? He will soon. Listen, if this works and Carlos comes back, what do we do with...|You know. The simpler the better, right? What? Explain to him you believe|he's a human being, that you know he's not an alien, but that being separated and all this made you think about your independence,|needing space, and once you guys have broken up,|we'll wait a while, a couple of weeks, and we'll act like we only just started|feeling something for each other. Isn't two weeks long enough? We'll play it by ear. That's what you want, right?|To take it slowly. - Right?|- Yeah. Is something worrying you? Why would I be worried? I don't know. That he won't believe us? Carlos always believes me. Julia... Angel! Angel, wake up! Look down there, on the sidewalk! What is that? They're explosives.|Julio's been making them. We can blow up your building|whenever we want. We've prepared a demonstration|for you. Julio, do it! Carlos. Hi. Is Julia there? Carlos, go ahead and do it|if you have to. Do what? I didn't bring your laptop. Don't worry about it.|Where's Julia? Hold on a second. Don't you want your stuff? I did before, but not anymore.|Put Julia on. Julia, what is this? Here it comes... Seriously, you can go ahead|and demolish - the building.|- That's not necessary. - Carlos, hold on.|- Seriously, listen to me. Something happened. You'll never doubt me again. We have a technical problem. - Carlos.|- Julia. Prove to me you're Carlos|or I'll hang up. - What? How long have you been|preparing this? - You made a threat, right?|- Yeah, but... Either make good or I'll hang up. Are you fucking stupid or what? Because the Carlos I know|never backs down. I said, are you fucking stupid|or what? Now will you listen to me? That's my car, damn it! Holy shit! Look where my peaches were!|My car and my peaches! You bomb people out of their homes|and you're also a thief! Julio! Yeah? Hurry, come back! Ricardo Rubin. Gonzalo Prada. Marta Navarro. - Okay?|- Yeah. What? Those were from|the city of Pontevedra. Now from Pontevedra province. - He's taken the whole building.|- What? Yesterday's explosion was to scare them,|to make them leave. Rebeca Molinillo. - Ours was just in case.|- He didn't get rid of that guy? No, because he confessed|he's an infiltrator. Pedro Pato. Then Carlos told him to name|all the infiltrators in Spain. Luis Angel Barreda. He's just reading random names|to save his skin. - Doesn't Carlos realize?|- Sara Castilla. We'll tell him tomorrow. Rodrigo Loro. - Tell him what?|- I said we'll drive there tomorrow. - What will we tell him?|- The truth. Maria Chau. What truth? That we haven't been infiltrated,|we've been lying and I cheated on him. No, hold on a second. Julia, you didn't cheat on him.|This was something else. Angel Numbella. This is more complicated. Maria Jose Carballo. You want to tell him everything? Eduardo Valdivia. Okay, that's good. Where's Angel? I left him at the...|Him too? - We'll do Galicia tomorrow at noon.|- But why? Please write down all the names on the list and share them|with as many people as you can. We have to stop this. If you know any of the people|mentioned, take the necessary measures. This is off, right? Okay, then. - Do you smoke?|- No. What about you guys? Don't worry, he'll understand. I'll get... It's funny how your colleagues|gave you up so quickly. They practically thanked me. And how quick you were to confess.|Don't think I'm not aware of it. I'll feel better|when my friends get here. If you're holding anything back,|we'll get it out of you. She's as sharp as they get. Did I tell you she spotted|one of your kind right away? The day the ships came,|she didn't even leave her apartment. Only to help some stranger|in the street. How about that? She's the person I admire most. What sucks is I'm telling you this|instead of her. I don't think I've ever told her. It's the first thing I'll tell her|in the morning. Julia wants to talk to you.|We both do. What? We're going home. You can go back to your apartment. What do you want to tell me? We owe you an apology. Out of nowhere?|What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? Don't tell me.|You screwed things up good? Did Carlos catch you two humping? This is going to be good. That's it, right? Is that it? Is that it? Is that it? You're going the wrong way... We're going somewhere|you won't bother us. But didn't you say Julia... I'll tell Julia I came here,|you got away, I looked everywhere|and couldn't find you. Period. What about Carlos? Carlos, Carlos, Carlos! Fuck Carlos! Carlos has nothing to do with this. I'm fucking in charge here|and I've had enough of you. Shit. The military has fenced off|the area right under the ship. Apparently people have seen|some weird stuff out there. I don't mean to scare you, but... maybe they're already doing something,|but in a way we don't realize. Maybe they can fit in among us|without us realizing. What was I saying? I was saying something. Angel. I'm sorry.|Please, forgive me. What? I didn't know... - I didn't know...|- You didn't know what? Please, let me go.|I'm begging you. You'll never see me again.|I'll leave Madrid. I've got a house in Cantabria.|I'll disappear. Please, let me out of the car. I won't tell anybody that you're a... that you're a... Well, you know. - You're untied.|- What? I didn't realize. Here. Anyway... - You're leaving, right?|- Yeah. You won't hurt me, right? No. Actually I'm thankful. Why is that? Because I've tried to get out|of this situation before and... it's really tough. What is? Not having the balls to leave|when you know for sure nobody wants you. Right... Here, take this. I don't want it. That means... everything you've done...|you did it all for her? Yeah. Like you. Yeah, but there's no comparison... Hi, it's me. Sorry, I set this up|because I didn't want to wake you. I understand you wanting|to come clean about everything and tell everybody, okay? But I don't know... I was thinking... and I came up with one more lie. Freeze! Hi. What were you doing in there? I... I'm sorry. What are you sorry about? - Where's Julia?|- She's fine, at her place. But... Carlos. I came to apologize. Apologize? For actually being a... You know. I promise you I meant well. I was gonna leave, take my... machine and leave. You wouldn't let me, remember? But after that I thought, "You'll never be this close again." You know how boring|my life is up there? Wait, wait, wait! That thing over there is yours? Yeah. I saw it. It drove right past. I described it|and this looks a lot like it. That weird car Julia saw,|the one you drew... Yeah. Maybe he came in it|and he's got it parked somewhere. - There are some swings over there.|- Yeah. You couldn't pay me|to go over there. You had it parked by the swings. - Son of a bitch!|- Carlos! What I'm most sorry about|is you leaving. Actually, we got rid of you. It was me, Julia was against it. I bolted the door and convinced her|not to open it. But why? Your notes, Carlos. Your books, all that information. I was dying to get my hands on it|without raising suspicion. I was sick and tired of pretending. - That's why you did it?|- I swear. - That's why you kept it.|- That's right. And that's why you didn't care|if I demolished your building. - You gave me a random address.|- Exactly. I only wanted to learn about you. When I go back, they probably|won't even ask what I did. They might not even know I came down.|Almost nobody does. No? Well, maybe to take a stroll, like I was doing when I blacked out.|But hardly anyone. Do the ones on the ship know|what I've been saying on TV? If the guy on TV were one of us they would have rescued him.|They don't give a shit. Damn. What I did to that poor guy... I've got him there. Why did you leave the apartment? Julia realized you were one of them,|didn't she? Actually she never believed|you were one of us. Is she by herself right now? - Then there's Angel...|- I don't wanna hear about that jerk. Here, let me. I'll handle it. - This is the key?|- Yeah. He's in a small room by the set. I'll clear things up for him. Why are you here? Yeah, with the ships and all that. There's no reason. What? You came for the hell of it? We extraterrestrials are like that. If my plan works, Carlos will be back anytime. So erase this tape right away. And that's all. Actually, it's not. There's something|I want to tell you. I came close to saying it many times but I thought|it might sound too... forced, too untimely, too fake. I'm not saying it won't sound fake now,|but I have to say it. I love you. How did you tape it? What do you mean? In a single shot or did you edit it? A single shot.|I turned on the camera and said it. You didn't write it down first? It just came out? Yeah. It's not so hard, is it? If I don't have it on paper|in front of me... I butcher it every time.
