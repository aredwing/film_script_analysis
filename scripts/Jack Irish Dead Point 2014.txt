I don't actually pack them, you know. And you drag me out of bed for this shit. It's the middle of the night. That's a federal warrant, Mr Cundall, and we'll drag you out here any time we like. I know what it is. Mate, that's yours. You know what? I just hope you're checking next door's yard as well. I'll mail it to you. Yeah, you do that. Look, it's on the bloody bottom. We'll be here all night. Have you organised something? Surprise. Huh. What'd I tell you? Smack. One-and-a-half kilos at a guess. Where's the rest of it? Keep looking. Hey, what's that? Get him! Roger, VKC, we have a visual on a red Porsche travelling North towards the bridge. He looks like he's making for the freeway on-ramp. He's heading under the bridge. We've lost visual. I'm taking another pass. He's gone. Affirmative. The target has gone. Sienna? What have you done? Put these on. Are you gonna talk to me? You can't be here. They'll be coming for me. What have you done, Robbie? You have to go. Give me that! Talk to me! You have to go, Sienna, it's not safe. You have to get the hell out. Robbie... NICK CAVE: Red Right Hand Take a little walk to the edge of town And go across the track Where the viaduct looms Like a bird of doom As it shifts and cracks Where secrets lie in the border fires In the humming wires Hey, man, you know you're never coming back Past the square, past the bridge Past the mills, past the stacks On a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man In a dusty black coat with a red right hand. Good morning, Melbourne. 3KB Talk Radio. Linda Hillier with you. Big night on the waterfront, and joining us now to dissect it, having just flown in this morning, and I mean that literally, she flies her own plane. Indeed I do. The Independent Member for Gippsland East, anti-drug crusader, Susan Ayliss. Welcome to the program. Good morning, Linda. Good morning. We're hearing reports of shots fired last night at Swanson dock. High-speed chase, stolen Porsche. Seems Justice Loder's report on waterfront corruption can't come out soon enough. The facts are still emerging here, so we'll continue to monitor and assess them. But right now I think we all need to take a deep breath rather... You fought tooth and nail for three years for this Judicial Inquiry. In fact, you're on record on this very show accusing Cundall Stevedoring of collusion with organised crime. Linda, far be it for me, or anyone, to pre-empt the findings of the Loder Report. Customs, the Maritime Union and our stevedores do a commendable job in challenging circumstances... We'll take a short break. My guest is Susan Ayliss, this is 3KB. What the hell was that? Free ad for the MUA? You just lost your guest. I don't appreciate being cut off. Then spare me the back-pedal, Susan. You have no idea what I'm up against. Here. Found his ID. Wrong end, brain cell. Looks like OD. Jeez, you're good. Hard to believe you're still a sergeant. Robert Colburne, another happy customer. Was he a person of interest to the Drug Squad, Ollie? Yeah, yeah, that's him, the prick. One of our informants. I'll tell you what, Baz, we'll take over from here if you don't mind. Go nuts. Oi, get over here. Get on the business end here. Barry? You still looking for your bloke Robbie Colburne? Oh, yeah, flat chat. I can confirm he's not buying a latte at Enzio's. Probably because he just carked it chasing the dragon over at Burnley. You owe me drinks. Plural. And you know that 'bookkeeper' is the only word in the English language with three sets of double letters all next to each other? Amazing. - Fellas. - Jack. That hot tip you gave us last Saturday, still running, is she? Stone motherless. Bloody pet food. Speaking of that, how's the new breakfast menu working out? Wide berth, Jack. Wide berth. Hey, Jack, no, you can't bring that in here. We do our own now. I did a barista course. Online. Invested in this little baby. I hope you kept the receipt. Stan, I'm more than happy to pay you for an empty mug, mate. And four of your amber breakfast brew. Make that five actually. This bloke of yours, pretty much just a garden variety OD. Pretty strange place to OD though, in your own garage. The Porsche he stole had seat warmers. That the Porsche from the docks? Mm. Mate of mine on the Drug Squad said he was a snitch. He's all over it. Olsen. Good operator. Old culture. How was that, Barry? It was genuinely shithouse, Stan. Ellie? Jack. Hi. Oh, it's so good to see you. You too. I was just dropping this off. Oh, what's the occasion? You're not finally divorcing Jamie, are you? A christening. We had a baby. A girl. Oh, congratulations. That's fantastic. Thank you. Wow. Jack, we've named her Isabel. I'm hoping that's OK. She would have loved that. Did you want to meet her? She's in the car with Mum. Sure. Mum? Hi, Pat. Oh, Jack. It's been too long. It has. Congratulations. Beautiful, isn't she? Yeah. So, will we see you there? Try and stop me. Isabel! Trouble is, you have a romanticised view, Jack. You and Isabel never got past the honeymoon phase. You never made it to the domestic dead zone. Being told how to stack the dishwasher, fishing clumps of her hair out of the shower drain, varicose veins, toenail clippings. I mean, you don't know how lucky you are. Have you ever considered a career in grief counselling? You know what I mean. Is that your school tie? Old Boys luncheon. Indestructible, these Grammar ties. It's probably why they're so good for suicides. A lot of the Grammar boys also use them for scarfing. Isn't... scarfing when you choke yourself during...? Good to see those school fees not going to waste. Taxi! Anyway, I'm not gonna need that anymore. So, you finally found Robbie Colburne, dead. Sterling work. Who do I bill? Bill? For what? Having a quiet one with Barry Tregear? Contacts, mate. That's how the work gets done. Ah, point of order. Work's not done. Client wants to meet you. Client who never wanted to meet now wants to meet. Mm. Well, who's the client? Colin? Jack. Been a long time. You're still looking eminent. Well, this was my father's ritual, when he was still sitting. Hmm. The might of the law must stand before the majesty of the church. He was right, of course. Hey, Ellie dropped by. I believe congratulations are in order, Grandpa. It's wonderful. It was a long time coming. 'Course, Pat and I always thought you and Issie would be the first. Come to the christening, Jack. You know you can bring someone. Bring someone. Alright. Haven't got long now. Only a few days before I hand down this report. Well, this Robbie Colburne you were looking for, you know he was a drug addict? Colburne had information which could have... ..critical effect on the Inquiry. Information that died with him, or...? There's a leather-bound book. It's red. His memoirs, I take it? Something like that. Then why not consult the police? My understanding is they come rather quickly when people like you call. At this stage, Jack, I don't necessarily trust the police. Some of their names could be in that book. Mm. I have to go. I have to be in court. Don't forget this is a matter of the utmost discretion. Of course. Listen, Colin, why didn't you come directly to me in the first place? Because every time I see you, I feel sad. Laurie Olsen? Oh, Jack, come in. Afraid I can only give you a bee's dick. Just working my way through the Amazon Forest here. Oh, that's a nice-looking cat. Yeah, Migsie. No longer with us. Yeah, Barry was telling me you're interested in one of our snitches. Yeah. Yeah, Robbie Colburne. He got form, has he? Track marks? Like Flinders Street Station, mate. Full-time pin cushion. Reckon I can have a squiz at one of those crime scene photos? Come on, mate. I'm already in the doghouse around here. Tell you what, Jack, if arseholes could fly, this would be an airport. Right. Right. I'll get out of your hair. Thanks. Oh, listen, sorry. Sorry, one more thing. You wouldn't have an address on Robbie, would you? Ah! Excuse me? I just want to talk to you! Oh! RADIO:..standstill on the ring-road... Yeah, I know how you feel. No, it's my ribs. A man's got to know his limitations, Jack. Fighting fence posts rarely ends well. Yeah. Hey, why are we bringing the Commissioner in on this one? Well, I've got a little nag ready to show unexpected form in a feature race. Wouldn't want anyone getting wind. Commissioner marshals a crack team... Sorry, this won't take long. You're with Linda Hillier on 3KB. Time now to hear from our listeners. The number to call is 1300-33-33-33. Our topic today, illegal drug importation. How can we raise... Oh, Len from Pascoe Vale. And first up we have Len from Pascoe Vale. - Am I on, Linda? - Yes, Len. Go ahead. Ah, long-time listener, first time caller. Big fan of the show. Appreciate that. Now, aphids and lace bugs, they're common plant pests, but with the right insecticide, you can... Len, if I can just stop you there. The topic is actually illicit street drugs. Oh, drugs, not bugs. And this not the gardening show? No, sorry. Oh, OK. Let's take another caller. So, we've successfully moved on from that relationship, have we? This is the Commissioner's house? Is someone gonna get that phone? Can you two stop fighting? Turn it off, please. Ollie, just give it to her. No! Ollie! Give it, Marie! Give it to me! Baxter, get out of it! Go get your bag. Turn the Xbox off! There she is. Lady Luck herself. Harry, come on in. Come and meet the case for contraception. Cam. Hey, Cyn. Jack. Commissioner. Baxter, out of the way. Hello, Mr Strang. Morning, Marie. Alright, there's your ride, you lot. Try and learn something today, OK? Got everything? Yep. Alright. Have a good day at school, you mob. See ya! Laters. See ya. Cup of tea? So, Cynth, all set for the Valley? Right as rain, Harry. My crew'll bet the market up. Push Mr Renoir out. Hit the ring, mop him up in the high 20s. Sorry. Irish. That was you before, wasn't it? Len from Pascoe Vale? Dixicano, now he's the short priced favourite. And there's... Shouldn't you be on air? I'm in an ad break. I'm in a life break. We'll play him like a banjo. The bookies'll be sucking their thumb in the foetal position. So, is this your way of asking me out to dinner? Listen, if you want to go out for dinner, just say so. I could book Donelli's. Doesn't anything change? Not if I can help it, no. I got a better idea. I'm back on air. I'll call you later. If our hoop stays wide, avoids the traffic. Mr Renoir's a duck. He'll swim home. Nice to have your full attention. Now, best you boys avoid the track. Keep it arm's length. And I'll meet you here for a Spumante. Still, shame they don't have races with just one horse in them. Just to be sure. JAZZY TUNE You look rather good. I'll pass for radio. It's good to have you back. Yes, I may never leave Melbourne again. Really? Well, maybe not never. You know, they say they've got never down to about six months now. So I, ah... saw you in the paper with that shock jock who does drive. My star-fucking days are over. I'm going for the lesser lights of the galaxy. Butchers, newsagents, suburban lawyers. Well, I can probably help you there. Oh, yeah? Yes. I know an excellent butcher. I'm thinking we take this slowly. Yes. Absolutely. Have you... have you heard of The Snug? I'm game if you are. I think it's a business in the city. Mm. Yeah, it's a private club. Yeah, invitation only. It's a veritable who's who. Governors General, Chief Justices, even a PM or two, I've heard. Why? You moving up in the world? I guess there's a dress code. What? Name? I'm not a member. I'm here about Robbie Colburne. Police? You've already been here. No, no, no. I'm a lawyer. My name's Jack Irish. I represent Robbie's family. (His name is Jack...) Welcome to The Snug, Mr Irish. I'm Ros Hoskin-Elliott. Jack. Strong hand, Jack. You don't always work behind a desk. No, not always. This is my assistant, Xavier. We call him X. The unknown. He's bi-curious if you're wondering. Oh, well, I'll keep that in mind. Sienna tells me that you're acting for Robbie's family. Yeah, there's an estate involved. We get a lot of lawyers in here. QCs, judges. Hmm. Ah, what... what sort of club is this, exactly? We provide an oasis of privacy and discretion. It's somewhere where members can be themselves. To Robbie, tenderest of bartenders. The needle was a surprise. A little bit of nasal recreation, I could understand. You think you know someone. Was he close to anyone here? Robbie was always something of a dark horse. And did he leave any personal effects behind? You know, maybe in a locker? I'm sorry I can't be of more assistance, Jack. But I will leave your name on the door. Hopefully we'll be seeing more of you. Actually, I was thinking about applying for a job. Do you always pay your bartenders this well? Only the best for my members, Jack. Sienna will see you out. You're not the family lawyer. Robbie didn't have any family. What do you lot want from him now? He's dead. Ah, Sienna, is there somewhere we can talk privately? Not here. Well, I'm a member of a club myself, actually. It's pretty exclusive. It's the Prince of Prussia, over in Fitzroy. I could definitely leave your name on the door. And here's my... Race No.3 on the card from Moonee Valley, 1,100 metres the trip. Caveat Lector is the firm favourite, with good money for Hairy Canary and Run Romeo Run. Racing now. Dixicano has got the best of the start. Thistlewaite and Pooka's Girl missed the kick by a length-and-a-half. As they race past the 600m mark, the favourite, Caveat Lector leads clearly. He's a length-and-a-half in front. Boozy Lunch is chasing from Dixicano and a margin away, back in the field to Hairy Canary and Run Romeo Run best of the rest. But Dixicano going after Caveat Lector in a tooth and nail struggle. They're two lengths in front and Mr Renoir's starting to run on, and then came Boozy Lunch. It's Mr Renoir out wide, the surprise packet. He's moved up to Caveat Lector. Mr Renoir's taken the lead. Dixicano's riding on but it's going to be the interstate rider, Mr Renoir. And Mr Renoir scores a dashing win. Real upset here. Mr Renoir, the favourite... In a real surprise, Mr Renoir has come storming down the outside, just passed Caveat Lector. Looked like he was going to hang on. Mr Renoir has come rocketing down the outside and won. And in the end, won pretty comfortably. Don't be a hero, bitch. Hand it over. Don't know what you're talking about. I've got it. Let's go. That'll do. She's done. Come on! Come on! Come on! My favourite moment is when it lifts off. Pat says I have a pathological obsession with hot air. Occupational hazard. I notice you're not carrying a red book. No. I, ah... I got close. I saw someone coming out of Robbie's flat with it but they got away. God help me. You're gonna have to tell me exactly what's in that book, Colin. It's a photo album. A photo album. Of what value? How do you value a career, Jack? I can't say I'm proud of myself. Look, just to let you know, I've been to The Snug. Those women are... pretty beautiful. Not hard to imagine... It wasn't a woman. Ever tried to quell a craving, Jack? Spend your life keeping the devil in the bottle? Robbie said he was into photography, black and white. Arty stuff. He said he wanted a few keepsakes, so... I gave him my old camera. Ros lent us her penthouse, her love nest as she calls it, not that I think it's ever seen much love. When he stopped returning my calls, I got scared. I knew he'd want money and gifts. Price you're paying for dirty little secrets. When I'd heard he'd died, it felt like a reprieve. All I could think of was getting hold of that red book before it fell into the wrong hands. I couldn't bear it if Pat and Ellie found out. Well, let's just wait till we get the phone call, eh? From whoever's got it, to see what they want. I know already. Mr Justice Loder, may I say what a charming couple you and Robbie make. The photographs are quite touching in their intimacy. What a shame you'll now have to step down from the Inquiry. I was so looking forward to your report but people can be so quick to judge. Do the wise thing, Your Honour, and the album and the negatives shall be returned. Are you gonna step down? Start all over again? All that testimony, null and void. Three years' work down the drain. A chance to make a difference. A chance to stop addicts like Wayne Milovich murdering my daughter. Destroy my career or destroy my family. I'll get that book back. The handover to the Premier is on Monday. Jack, I must say I find having you as a colleague... strangely comforting. Oh. Judge calling me a colleague, that's got to be the high watermark of my career. I remember Isabel always said we should do that together one day. Irish. There she is. Hey, Cynthia. Hey, Cynthia. Looking after your mum, Marie? Yes, Mr Strang. There were two of 'em. The money. Harry, I'm so sorry. Now, now, now, none of that. You just rest up. You don't worry about a thing. Little something for the hospital bills. I should never have let her leave the track on her own. You couldn't have known, Harry. The punt's the punt, but this is something else. Not a thing used to happen. Bash a woman like that. Bastards would do anything. Not the sport of kings anymore. Makes you wonder about giving it up. Shutting up shop. We'll fix this Cynthia thing, boss. Yeah, we'll take care of it, Harry. I wonder if there's security footage in the car park. I'll put a call in to my mate at the Valley. Soupe du jour. Well, it does always feel like Paris in here, Stan. Homemade, is it? Oh, yeah. Fresh out of le can. Now, did I tell you, Jack, I'm expanding the clientele? Moving up-market. Cyber frontier. You know, new technology. The IT crowd. Who? Eye-ties? All in Carlton, the Eye-talians. No, no, no. IT. Information technology. The way you blokes think, a flush dunny would be new technology. Oh, a dunny that flushed around here would be new technology, Stan. Hey, Jack? Working already. Welcome to the Fitzroy Youth Club. I get the feeling your joining fee may be waived. Cards on the table, who are you? Ah, well, my client was being blackmailed by Robbie. You don't seem very surprised by that. You and he close? I thought we were. But no-one got close to Robbie. Because of the drugs? The only time I ever saw him touch drugs was to deal them. Did you ever hear about Robbie having relationships with men? Because there's an album of photos that's gone missing. I just... I think we're talking about sex, not relationships. Your client, Colin Loder, right? I know him from The Snug. I've seen the photos. And someone put Robbie up to it? What do you think? The judge wasn't the only one he set up. Somebody pressed that needle in, Jack. Somebody wanted him dead. I've got to go to work. Thanks. Oh, see you later. Tell your friends. Are you Warren from Mulgrave? I mean, really, Jack, come on. How'd you find this? Ah, can't say. Hmm. Who's the stud? Robbie Colburne. From the raid on the docks? The junkie that was found dead in the Porsche? Yep. Who's your client? I can't tell you that either. You've seen enough? Yeah. Well, it explains why she's been muzzled. This is big. Mm, it is. But you can't run with it yet, OK? Just give me a few days. Firstly, what I need from you is Susan Ayliss's phone number. Quid pro quo, Jack. You can't expect me to sit on my hands for too long. Who the fuck are you? I have backed off. What more do you want from me? Money? Oh, no, I'm a lawyer. I represent one of Robbie's other victims. Oh. So you've seen it then? That was supposed to be a private recording. I was lonely, Mr Irish. I've never had sex like that before. Sure. Did you only meet Robbie the one time? After we left The Snug, we went back to his place. And the blackmail was to gag you on the waterfront corruption. A sex tape of Susan Ayliss? Should have told them to send it to every television station in the country. It's not like I'm married. Might've improved my social life. Do you have any idea who was behind it? Mike Cundall came to mind. Cundall Stevedores? Did you confront him? I'm only stupid once. Robbie's death, did that surprise you? Yeah. It made me sad. I was hoping I'd have the chance to kill him myself. Ah, excuse me? Are you Mike Cundall? What grubby newspaper are you from? Ah, I'm not a journo, mate. Oh, lucky. I was going to accidentally have to drop one of those containers on you. No, my name's Jack. I'm a lawyer. Oh, spoke too soon. How'd you get security access? Ah, Justice Loder's office. Listen, I just wanted to ask you if you were aware of a sex tape involving Susan Ayliss. No. But if you've got a copy I'm happy to take a look. Well, she reckons you might have put Robbie Colburne up to it. Yeah? Oh, that'd be a fair cop, you know? Now, between processing half a million containers here, I like to make a bit of amateur porn on the weekend. Do you know Robbie Colburne? Yeah, heard the name. Pinched that Porsche, didn't he? Well, and a bootload of smack, apparently. Listen, if you think some pissant Judicial Inquiry's going to bother me, you're wrong, alright? I deal with the big boys in shipping. Take a look. See? Just don't expect me to take the fall for some conga line fuck-sticks running Customs and the AFP, got it? Now, there's the exit. Fuck off. What time do you call this, huh? You come and go as you please. Like a cat. The place looks like a mausoleum. Charlie still in the old country, is he? Yeah. He hasn't even sent me a postcard. Come for a ride, Jack. They're letting the Commissioner out of hospital today. Oh, yeah? Righto. I should have taken up cabinet making. Man needs a hobby. Maybe golf. Stamps. You've got your horseracing, Harry. They're just quadrupeds running in a circle. I'll be in the car. First time he's been out of his dressing gown in days. He won't even look at the form guide. Hey, my mate from Moonee Valley, he came through. CCTV, black Land Cruiser, left the car park just after our race. Let me guess, stolen car? But I spoke to Cynthia before. Less vague now, but she says one of them had a tatt on his middle finger, right hand. What sort of tatt? Oh, jailbird tatt. Stick figure with a halo. Bit like an old Saints logo. Oh, a Saints fan with a criminal record. That should narrow it down a bit. That's the way. Easy does it. Somebody did the garden. Harry sent his man over. Somebody's done the house. Oh, Harry's got a man for everything. All you need to be doing, Cynth, is getting better. Even the shopping. Oh, are... are you in pain, love? You right, Cynth? I don't deserve this. Well, of course you do! I'm not a good mum. What sort of life have I given my kids? Where's this coming from, mate? This the morphine talking? They'll be home soon. Must look a fright. Maybe get her make-up. I don't have any. Oh. Try Marie's. It's my own stupid fault. Working seven days a week, letting Frank screw me over with child support. Oh, come on. Come on. Cam, you're hurting my arm. Oh, you mean this one you've been jabbing needles in? I found this in your room. What were you doing in my room? I was looking for make-up for your mum. You haven't told her, have you? Listen, it's not about the drugs. It's about whoever it was who nearly killed your mother. It's over. I haven't used since she got bashed. You realise you could go to jail for conspiracy, don't you? I told this bloke that my mum did big money bets. What bloke? Come on, Marie, you can't go back now. Artie. His name's Artie. Artie. He hasn't got a tattoo on his finger, has he? Little stick figure. I don't know where to find him. He has a number you text. So why'd you tell him? Showing off? I don't know. It was stupid. Mum always warned me that... Alright, so you told Artie and then what? He says, 'Tell me when your mum's going to the races and I'll... ..I'll give you a free hit.' Nice. That morning y'all came round, I knew something big was brewing. I'll trace the number. I'll let you know when I find him. Still want that crime scene happy snap? Oh, and they say you blokes move at a glacial pace. Speaking of, have you seen this pie? This thing's crumbling like an Antarctic ice shelf. Hand ball over the top! You know, if you squint you can almost forget it's only the amateurs. Go Roys! Yeah! Bravo! Oh, lovely play! Oh, did you see the sidestep? Feel like I've died and gone to heaven. We're gonna win this one, Jack! I can feel it in me bones. I reckon that's your osteo, Eric. Who's this, mate? Elvis Presley. Who do you think it is? Well, it's not Robbie Colburne. No, it's definitely not him. Well, there's a shitload of paperwork that says differently. If Robbie wasn't dead, where do you reckon he'd be? Wait in your car. I'll see if I can get away. It's a nice car. It's a Studebaker, right? Yeah. Sienna can't get away. There's a cabinet minister that needs entertaining. She told me about the photographs. Mm. So it seems that Judge Loder's been a victim of a rogue element of my establishment. So Robbie wasn't bidding on your behalf, then? Jack, I'm a facilitator. I'm a keeper of secrets. Mm. There's no Snug without them. Colin's a good man, I don't want to see his name dragged through the mud. So, if there's anything that I can do... Thanks. Come inside next time. You must be the world's oldest apprentice. Can't sleep? Here, make yourself useful and hold that, will you? It's a two-person job. When does Charlie get back? I don't know. It was only supposed to be a short trip, apparently. I'm wondering if he's gone home to die like an elephant. Why didn't you tell me that Justice Loder's your father-in-law? I saw the invitation on the fridge. I didn't think it was relevant. Is he your mystery client? Well, he's a member of The Snug, so is Susan Ayliss. What's going on, Jack? Look, he's been compromised, OK? It's a personal matter. Oh, I hear the women there are beautiful. Been touching the merchandise, has he? It's a... Just hold that. Please don't run the story, OK? It'll kill him. But if Loder's being blackmailed like Susan Ayliss, then someone's trying to fix a Judicial Inquiry. People need to know about that. You want to win a Walkley Award by outing a judge, is that right? If he wasn't Isabel's father, would we even be having this conversation? Is this for your niece? Yep. They named her Isabel. Yes, they did. Can you believe it? Why don't you move in? Just like that? Yeah. I mean, people do it. What are we doing? Cooking meals for one. Sleeping in empty beds. I'm just not sure what we're waiting for. Well... ..why don't we start with you inviting me to the christening? Baby steps. God, I love it when you speak like that. I, Isabel Irish do hereby, herewith, heretofore claim all reasonable rights, wavers, warranties and consents to enjoin, restrain or otherwise ravish you unconditionally under the Marital Act in perpetuity, habeas corpus, prima facie, carpe diem, ad hoc, ad hominem, ad nauseam, adios, adieu, arrivederci, sayonara. How much wood could a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood? And hereby agree to indemnify the plaintiff against alleged... She's adorable. I can probably get rid of that now. You know, I had a guest on the show once who sets a place at the dinner table for his wife every night, even though she's been dead for 17 years. His second wife doesn't even bat an eyelid. You can't hurry the letting go, Jack. Well, just to let you know, I don't have three sets of cutlery. Cam. Linda. Cam. Jack. See ya. Fancy a drive, Jack? Ah... yeah, alright. The billing address for Artie's phone is at North Sunshine. A-OK salvage. Dead-end by the looks of it. Not exactly the golden triangle. As far as I'm concerned, you stayed in the car. Oi! You Artie? Don't know where he is. You mind? I'm working here. Well, it might be a good idea if you talked to us. Tell us where we might be able to find him. Hey? Why don't you fuck off? That was a big mistake. Cocky. Just give us a yell if you need a hand, Cam. Just grab the door for us, Jack? And grab the keys. Get in, you maggot. What's this about?! Remember that day at the Valley when you beat that woman to a pulp? I don't know what you're talking about! What are you doing?! No! Where's the money you took? What money? No! No! No! No! Where's the money, Artie? This is the last time I'm asking. That's enough! Turn it off! What, do you always go in the portaloo with a shotgun? Get out! Nice and slow. Something amusing, is there? I didn't touch her, I swear. It was Artie. God's my witness, he just went berko. Shut up! Where's the money you took? Inside, behind the poster. There's a safe. Piss-weak dog! Lizard! Well, why don't you show us where that picture is, Lizard? Classy. Open it! Step back. Hey. Irish. Jack? It's Sienna. I need to see you. I think there's someone you should meet. Hey. Hello? Jack. Welcome to the Cathexis. You found it OK? Yeah. Where's Sienna? We're out by the pool. I believe you've met my husband Mike. You're not acrophobic, are you, Jack? It's a long way down. Husband. Mm. I kept my family name. Carries more weight. This is Senior Sergeant Olsen. He's our... like, liaison officer. Take a seat, Jack. Supplementing your super, I assume, Laurie. Yeah, well, you know. I was kind of hoping when Sienna mentioned a mystery guest that I might finally get to meet Robbie. Why would you ID a no-name junkie as Robbie? Ohh... Easier to kill someone when he's already dead. No paperwork. So, your, um... pet got off the leash, Mike? Supposed to deliver a Porsche and went AWOL? Thieving prick didn't take into account that Laurie here was on the books. Beretta. Better than a Glock. Don't trust those Austrians. What are you playing at, Jack? Are you waiting for us to blink first? Is that why you're trying to find Robbie? Do you think that maybe he's got the photo album? Hey, Mike? The neighbours. You need to advise your client to step down. Now. Colin, it's Jack. Listen... Ah... I'm just going to have to call you back. - Jack Irish? - Yeah. This your vehicle? What's going on? You mind opening the boot for us? Sure. You're under arrest. Keep your hands behind your back. Code 33. Dead girl in the boot, Jack. Pretty serious warning. They don't have it. What? The book. If they did, they wouldn't have gone to so much trouble to stop me from finding Robbie. You gotta get me out of here, mate. You are good at this sort of thing, aren't you? I'm not a QC. That's not really helping. Mr Irish. I'm Detective Sergeant Tregear, this is Detective Constable Owens. After the bloody siren. Cruel A 60-metre torp. You wouldn't bloody read about it. She was a sweet kid, Sienna. And they just chewed her up and spat her out. Who's they? The Cundalls. And your man, Olsen. Shit. '32 years on the force', you said. 'One of the only men I could trust.' Adds up actually. You know, the brass have been trying to figure out who's been rolling out the red carpet on illegal imports for years. So Olsen snaffles a few crumbs while the mother lode waltzes through. The wharfies up to their necks in it. Owned and operated by a right royal Cundall. Keep your head down, Jack. It's my arse on the line now. Listen, how long's my car going to be impounded? I don't reckon they're going to let me drive around in one of Cam's bogan-mobiles for too long. You're lucky you're not impounded. You know, cutting you loose isn't exactly standard procedure. Gotta go. I have to swing past Carol's. Promised her a knee-trembler against the Kelvinator. They're bluffing, Colin. They don't have the red book. Robbie stole their drugs and nicked off before they had the chance to get it, and he must have forgotten it and left it behind in all the chaos, so he had to come back. But why? I mean, he wasn't the focus of the enquiry. He was at the bottom of the food chain. Bargaining chip, I suppose, in case the Cundalls went after him. The press conference is tomorrow morning. After the report is handed down, he'll have nothing to bargain with. Well, that's right. They'll be under arrest or in jail, and he'll be free. The book won't mean anything to him. The bloody book is still out there! If Pat and Ellie find out about this, it'll break them. Judicial Inquiries, Royal Commissions, where the shit interfaces with the fan. Until that book is destroyed, it's going to hang over my head like a sword of Damocles. Listen, I'll find Robbie before they do, OK? A lifetime of trying to do the right thing. The Honourable Judge, devoted husband, respectable family man. But you fuck one goat... You mustn't judge me, Jack. Isabel adored you, Colin. That's good enough for me. Don't do anything rash, OK? Moving office? I don't have long, Mr Irish. Listen, Robbie Colburne's not dead. Is that a sick joke? No. He didn't happen to mention anything to you about a place to hide, did he? We barely spoke. So he didn't say anything at The Snug or back at his place that night about a holiday house or a property? It was purely physical. There was nothing else. Are you sure he's not dead? You may get your chance to kill him after all. Warren from Mulgrave. I knew it. Heard the news? Susan Ayliss resigned. Personal reasons. Ah. Well, I'm on my way home. I'll see you there. Susan, it's Linda Hillier again. I'm still looking for a comment before I run the story on the Colburne tape tomorrow. Ah, look, if... anyway. You have my number. Thank you. What took you so long? Someone just tried to kill me in Fitzroy Gardens. Shit. Here. Take a look at this. Did you hear what I just said? Yeah, yeah, but you're OK, right? There it is. See? Her face. It's that look. She did say she'd never had sex like that before. That can sway the best of us, believe me, but that look. That's more than lust. She fell for the bad boy. We should know better but we always end up falling for them. That's why she resigned. So, she's a liar. And that's not the only time she's had sex with Robbie in his Burnley sex pad. Since when was Burnley near the ocean? What do you mean? There, in the window. Do you see it? A flash of light? It's headlights, isn't it? No, no, that's not headlights. There. That's a lighthouse. How is that a lighthouse? It's every six seconds. Oh, right. Hey, she's the member for East Gippsland, isn't she? So I reckon we need a list of all the working lighthouses in that area. With an airstrip nearby. She's a pilot, flies her own plane to and from Melbourne. A regular Amelia Earhart. Are you going to Loder's press conference tomorrow? 'Course. I'm a bit worried about him. Jack, I know the Judge is family, but is it worth all this? Of course it is. OK. There's only one airstrip. A private property at Dead Point. Well, it's quite a leap, Susan, going from blackmail victim to this. You spent five years of your life crusading against drugs and you throw it all away for some bloke who fakes his own death and knocks off some poor junkie. He was one shot away anyway. It was the only way I could disappear. Right. You must feel real proud of yourself. We fell in love. We weren't expecting that to happen. Well, I've seen his handiwork. I need that red book. Forget it. It's my insurance. We have to go. We have a long flight ahead. How'd you get those marks on your neck, huh? You been playing on the swings? You're hurting him! They're here. Where's the photo album? It's in the plane! Show me! Hey! Don't move! Hello, Jack! You know, Jack, I think I'm going to have to revoke your Snug membership. Get her here. On your knees. On your knees! Hey, naughty boy. Mm! As for you, Judas, we'll have our drugs back now if you don't mind. It's in the plane. They're all yours. Just... let us go. Thought about it. The answer's no. Please! Please! Get him. Shut up! Let's go! What are you looking at? Get the fucking thing started up! Jack, it's Colin. It's almost time. Thank you. I know you did your best. Pat? Pat, it's me. I want you to know that I love you. Go, go! What the fuck? Get this fucking thing up! Fuck! Go! Let's go! Get out! Jack, they can't find the judge. Nobody knows where he is. Jack? Mr Premier! FEMALE REPORTER: Where's Judge Loder? Judge Loder! Never mind. He's here. Laurie Olsen, you're under arrest. You know the routine. You're not obliged to say anything... Pat. Hi. Oh, I'm so glad you could come. Congratulations. Oh, are you hurt? No, it's nothing. I fell over running. I'd like to introduce you to Linda. Pat. I listen to your show every day. Thank you. It was a lovely ceremony. Justice Loder, it's an honour. Ah, Colin, please. Here she comes! Hi, Ellie. Hi. Congratulations. Um, this is Linda, Ellie. Hi. Nice to meet you. Hi. You have a beautiful baby. Thank you. I think she can't wait to get home and into her crib. Charlie Taub's a maestro. Last of his kind. Do you want to hold her, Jack? Sure. Isabel, meet your uncle Jack. Hi, Isabel. I'm really happy for them.
