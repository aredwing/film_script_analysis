And down here is Alderman's Wharf. - This one? - Yes. We'll take a look at the boats while we're down here. They get some pretty big stuff in here now and again, you know. Yeah.

Whom none could advise, thou hast persuaded; what none hath dared, thou hast done; and whom all the world hath flattered, thou only hast cast out of the world and despised: thou hast drawn together all the far stretched greatness, all the pride, cruelty and ambition of man, and covered it all over with those two narrow words, Hic jacet!

( Sings "Out with me barrow and my moke all day") Carting me greens about Now fine cauliflowers You can't beat ours You can hear me shout "I'm here girls" Curly little greens, long French beans And me spuds all nice and brown Now if you boil 'em for an hour They're like a bowl of flour And me rhubarb is the best in all the town! Me rhubarb is the best in all the town! (Johnny) Trinidad Street! Get a point on it! - Someone on top of the line! - OK! Come on! Hydrant here! Got one here. That ain't a bleeding hydrant, it's a sewer! - (Man) Hydrant! - OK, my cooker! Come on! Up a bit. Whoa! Cor blimey, that wall looks a bit dodgy. I hope when it goes, it goes the rightway. Yeah, me, too. This way! You'll want three lengths. (Dull explosions in distance) - Right, straight out, BA. - OK. Bill, take it up to where he gets to, couple it up and run it back here. Up top! (Coughing and spluttering) - Blimey, what a light. - That's nothing, Jacko. Watch it getting across this river with the wind. Rumbold, secure that branch to this bar just till we get it up. I'll get back to the base now. You hold onto that now and I'll pick this up. Up top! Where's that line? Stand clear below! OK! - Where the hell are you going? - Up top. Well, stick around and deal with this first. Two half-hitches... ...and a clove hitch. (Explosion) - OK, take it away! - Take it away! Haul away! Hello? Hello? Is that 14 Local? Is that 14 Local speaking? This is Sub-officer Dykes speaking from Trinidad Street. Now take this message: "Make the pumps up to ten." That's right. No, don't go away. Additional message... (Explosion) I say additional message: "Order a fireboat to Alderman's Wharf." That's right. "Explosives involved at the fire." All right, drop that. Now listen... I want you to stand by here. Johnny, give him a hand with that. Another length of hose over that wall. Take the ladder and the rest of the crew, and get your brass in as far as possible, got that? Now come on, lads, get to work. Now, BA, short ladder. I'll go and see what it looks like. - Where you going, BA? - Short ladder, Johnny. This doesn't go anywhere. We'll have to go to the top. - BA? - OK, John! (Whistling incoming bomb) (Heavy explosion) What a windy lot of bastards we are! That was half a mile away! Half a mile, my foot! - It was too close for me. - You're telling me! Sir, message from Trinidad Street: "Make pumps up to ten." Additional message: "Order fireboat to Alderman's Wharf." "Explosives involved at the fire. Danger of spreading to supply ship." Ten? He's got a hope. We'll send him five to get on with, anyhow. Send a TP from V, a TP from W, send a heavy and a TP from X. Get District Officer Blythe to go out, will you? (Woman) Control here. Order a heavy unit and trailer to Trinidad Street. - Haven't you got any water yet? - Not yet. What about our water, below? Here she comes! - All right, up top? - Yeah, we got a roof up here. Up you go, Johnny, he's got the branch on the top. - OK now, that's enough. - Right-o. (Explosion) No, no, not there! Put it down into the scene of it there. That's it, get hold of it. OK. - (Walt) Johnny, water! - OK, Walt! - 105! - It's all yours! There she goes, boys! - Right in the corner, John! - Aye! Switchboard, sorry to keep you waiting. Joan! Thank you. Number 14's fireboat out to Alderman's Wharf. Have we got anything at Alderman's Wharf? One quite close at Trinidad Street. That must be the same, then. It's low tide, too, they'll have a devil of a job. (Explosions) Johnny, can you give us a bit more on this one? - No, I can't give you any more. - Not 20lbs? No, I can't give you anything at all, there's not enough here. Look, I tell you what we'll do. While you're hanging about, go down the road and see where the nearest open water supply is. Where do you think that is? I think that looks like Trinidad Street. That's it, down below now. - Oh, crikey! - What the hell's wrong? Johnny! What's the matter with this water? Johnny! She's finished! - Must've been that bomb, you know. - I don't think so. Look out... (Flames intensify) That fire seems to be getting worse. Better give them another ring, Tom. (Telephone rings) OP Control. 36 OP? Yes? Yes. Thank you. Fire at 150 degrees and increasing rapidly. Right, notify anti-aircraft again. All this lot's getting away now, because you've not got a jet of water, see? Look at it. (Explosions) - Control? What was that? - It's a bad line, can you shout louder? - What? - Can't hear you at all. Oh, yes. - Right. Sub? Sub? - Yes? A Z's number 1 heavy unit out to Ship Alley. All right. We're down to four, sir. (Heavy explosions) Johnny! What's the matter with this water? I've found some. That sunk barge we saw this afternoon up the cut. Oh, that's it! Go down the road and stop those pumps. - Tell them to relay the water onto us. - Right. Johnny! (Fire bell ringing) Stop! Stop! - Where the hell are you playing at? - Can't go down that way, sir. No water down there, the mains have broken. We've got a branch on the roof we'll have to pack up unless we get water. I found a sunk barge in a cut down there. We can relay it down to our heavy. - First on the left? - It's along that alley. Sub-officer, take your appliances to the first turning on the left. Get to work! Relay water! - Are you the officer in charge? - Just a minute, please. Go make an order on a turntable ladder. Our wharf's well alight, what can you do for us? I've got more appliances coming shortly. Don't worry. - Right. - Stick her in there. Water! (Pumps speed up) Get your jet down there into it. You'll get it all right. Stand by, up top! Stand by, here she comes! Here goes a bit of water. No, not up there! Put it down! Put it down into the window! Steady my way! Here's your water up! OK! - All right, George? - It's putting some stuff through now. - Back up. - All right, that's it. Oh, 14-Control, here. We have four pumps available. - Stand-bys are urgently required. - Right. Yes, that's right. Will you hold on? (Explosion) Stand by. I can't hear you. I can't hear you. Control? Control? Control? Yes, sorry for the interruption, we have another message for you. Our TTL is out for Trinidad Street. Out to where? Trinidad Street. Right. Thank you. That's not so good, is it? Get round the district. Check pumps available. - Watch room 62, please. - Watch room 66, please. C-District control here. Can I have your pumps available, please? 14, how many pumps available? Only four? Can you hear me? Checking your pumps available. Ten pumps, thank you. Will you give me your pumps available, please? - Sixty-six. - Nil? - Ten. - Thank you. Twenty-eight. Nil. Eighty-eight. Nil. - Sub, only sixty-six pumps available. - Right, get on to Brigade Control. "Calls still being received. Further help required." "Pumps available: sixty-six." Brigade Control? C-Charlie District Control... ...further help required. Pumps available: sixty-six. Six-six. Right. - Joan? Oh, there you are. - Thank you. There's nothing in D. Five GPs at E... C District. Sixty-six pumps available. Further help required. Nothing in B, nothing in A. Er, message to Fire Control. Reinforcements, a hundred pumps required. Well, how are you getting on? C District has a rather concentrated fire attack, sir. I've asked for a hundred pumps from Fire Control. Anybody shaky? Definitely the C-District, sir. They're very much stressed. Right, well, I'll go and have a look round, and I'll let you know. - Carry on. - Very good, sir. (Fire bells ringing) (Explosions) All right, Barrett? Where've you been? Oh, all over. What's it like here? Not so clever. There's going to be some trouble later on, I'm not kidding you. Now, Colonel, get down below and tell the officer in charge that things are becoming out of hand. Got it? Go on, get down as quick as you can. There's a few of them loose, John. There's a message from the Sub up top, sir! (Coughing) Things are getting very difficult. He wants assistance as soon as possible. Right. Up top! Tell them to come down at once. We've got a turntable ladder coming along. Right, sir. District Officer says you got to get off the roof. How the hell do you think we're going to get down there? I don't know how the hell I came up! (Whistle and explosion) Get him out of the flames there. (Fire bell ringing) Stop and jack! There's a man hurt, down below! There's a man hurt! (Officer) Get the ladders to work! Get your rescue line out! Jump to it, men - What luck, eh? - All right, men. What luck. Watch that door! Look out! - There are firemen on top, sir. - What? Take in that slack. Lift him from the shoulders. Lift him up. Onto the parapet. Watch that slack! Give me that lifeline. Give it me, I know what to do with it. You get down. Come down off that bloody roof! - Go on. Go on down, then! - Are you coming along? I'll be down. You get down and out of it. Jump on the ladder! What's the damn fool doing? Swing it round, Norris! Bring them away! There's another man up there, sir. Let's get this one down first and we'll go back after him. Right, lower away! Lower him, man, faster! Lower him down. He's right down, sir. He's all right. It's the other one we're worried about. (Flames crackling) Come on! - Blimey, look at that wall. - Lock off, the wall's going! Shut it off! Let go! Brigade Control. A message from Fire Control. "Reinforcements." "One hundred pumps have been ordered from Abbotstone" "to stand by in your area." Thank you. Joan! Joan! That should be three heavy units not two there. (Telephone rings) 14-Control. Oh, they're on their way, are they? Right. Sub, those stand-bys are on their way in now. That's something, anyhow. - Is this 14 Y? - Yes. Oh, I had a hell of a job finding this place. We've come from Abbotstone. We were sent by your control to stand by here. - Abbotstone? - Yes, the other side of Coleford. - Why, that's 60 miles away. - Don't I know it! You people seem to be having a regular pasting down here tonight. Yes, our boys at the docks. Don't touch that, it'll be hot! Barrett! Let's have it! Johnny! Here she comes! - I can't hold it much longer. - Both of you, stop where you are! Come over this side. I'm staying where I am. I'm all right. - Here she comes! - Here she comes. - Well, that would be Jacko. - Stay still. Messing about on the roof, when he should've come down out of it. 36-OP. Thompson speaking. 36-OP, yes? Fire at 150 degrees. Appears to be under control. Thank you. Thank goodness for that. (Distant air-raid sirens wailing) (Air-raid sirens intensify) (Air-raid sirens stop) Way-aye! What's the matter, can't you take it, chum? - Haven't you heard? - No, what? - Jacko's copped it. - Copped it bad? He's copped it, I tell you! - Thanks, very much. - What a night, eh? (Laughter and banter) We deserve a cup of tea, eh, boys? Bless you, my beautiful! You look pretty beautiful yourself, too, mate! Who's your officer in charge, chum? I'm in charge, Sub. Our Sub-officer's injured. Well, knock off and make up and get off home. Yes, sir. Johnny knock off and make up! OK, Walt! Make up and get home. All right, Johnny. Had a bad night? Bad night? You wanna go down the road and have a look over the wall. There's a boat down there, good as new, she ain't got a scratch on her. She's a sight for sore eyes. (Bell ringing) - Hey, Doctor! - Hey, we left you a bit. - Still here? - Yeah, she's still afloat. (Radio) ...so far it does not appear that casualties are likely to be heavy. In one district, the attack became concentrated and several large fires were started. These, however, were successfully prevented from spreading. Agency reports say... No, we weren't hit. She'll make it all right. She'll be there on time. Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men, As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept All by the name of dogs. The valued file distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle... - (Woman) Take your wet clothes off, Bill. - Thanks, Ma'am.
