I thought you'd lie in this morning. No such luck. I've got to work today. I told you. Not Sunday again? I thought you were joking. No joke. New shipment of timber in from the Baltic. Simpson wants the whole lot checked by morning. Simpson! Doesn't he think you've got a home? - Morning, Mum. Is breakfast ready? - In a minute, Bri. Are we eating in here this morning? Ha-ha! You really have to go in today, Jimbo? Yeah, I told you, I don't like it any more than you do. - What's up? - Your father's got to go to work. You'll overdo it. That's what will happen. - Tough luck, Dad. - Yeah. I'm shaving every day now, Dad. Have to. I get real stubble if I don't. So, you're the one that's running off with all the blessed blades. What you gonna do with yourself today? I've got a match this morning. Taking Christine out this afternoon. - Christine? Oh, getting serious, eh? - No, not me. Too much sense. I'll start getting serious about girls when I've done my army training. Yeah, that'll be time enough. (Orchestral ballad plays loudly) - Hey, Mum, how about breakfast? - It's all ready, all ready. Jimbo! Your breakfast'll be cold. - Amy, there's no button on this collar. - Button? Didn't I do it? I was sure I... Never mind. You sit down and eat, and I'll sew it on after. Won't take a tick. Now, my work box. Where is it? Oh. - Mine in the oven? - Yes, Bri, I'll get it. (She hums tune) While you're out today, I'm gonna have a real go at this place. Tidy it up once and for all. - What's funny in that? - Nothing. Don't you think I'm capable of being tidy? I didn't say a word. - Could I have a bit of the table? - Oh, sorry, Bri. (Orchestral music playing) (Clattering) - Where do I sit? - Honestly! I don't know what you think I am! Honestly! Well, anyone would think, to hear you two, I never did anything! Let me tell you, I've been on my feet since seven while you were snoring. - I never said you didn't work, Mum. - Ooh, thank you! - Here, Jim. This'll do. - (Brian) But nothing's organised. You work like a horse but you never seen to get anywhere. You do a bit of this and a bit of that, but nothing's ever finished. Fine way to talk to your mother! Ha-ha-ha! I don't mean it in... in a bad way, Mum, but I am right. I mean, well, just look round this room for a start. Oh, it's a bit of a muddle, but you can't say I don't try. - I wouldn't change... - Mind my needle! Come on, Amy, let's have that button. I must go. (He grunts) (She laughs) Anyway, what does it matter so long as we're happy? Hope this Sunday work isn't going to become a habit, Jimbo. - Do you get paid overtime for Sundays? - Ho-ho! They expect too much of you, Jim. No, I'm hoping you'll make a fortune, Brian, and keep me in my old age. Expect too much, they do. Expect too much. There. Thanks. Oh, thanks. - Clean hanky? - Hm? - Shall I save your supper? - No, I'll get something hot midday. I was so looking forward to today. I thought we might go out this afternoon. - Never mind. - Look, I tell you what. Get your best bib and tucker on, round about seven, and we'll go up to the Cricketers, have a drink. Lovely. - So long, Brian. - Bye, Dad. Grey hair. Found a grey hair! I'm not as old as all that. Oh, your father's left his cigarettes. Jimbo! You forgot... Jimbo! Jimbo! You forgot your cigarettes! You'll forget your head next! - Here, catch! - No, I'll come up! Don't be late! (Phone rings) Hello? That you, Georgie? Preston, what's happened? Is anything wrong? It's just I wanted to tell you I was on my way. (Chuckles) For a moment I thought you were going to say you couldn't make it. I'll be along. (Birds chirping) (Doorbell rings) - Let me look at you. - You saw me yesterday. I haven't changed. - Hair's all different. - (Snorts) Every time I look at you, I get a new surprise. I see the same thing, but I'm surprised every time. You're beautiful, Georgie. I love Sundays. I've got you all to myself. No office. No Simpson. (Whispers) No telephone. I love these Sundays. I love you, Georgie. Georgie, will you answer me something? Depends. Every morning when I'm shaving, I look at my face in the mirror and I say, "Why me?" Why me, Georgie? You tell me. I always had a clear idea of the man I'd fall in love with. He smoked a pipe, worked outdoors at some interesting job, and loved music. Then I met you. You smoke cigarettes, you work indoors at a dull job, and you hate music. - You explain it to me. - I'll explain it to you. I'm the first man in your life. You were ready to fall in love and I just happened to be there. You'll get around a bit, you'll soon forget me. Don't say that. Don't ever say that, not even in fun. I love you, Preston. The way you call me Preston! (Both chuckle) That's to distinguish me from all the others. (Bells ringing outside) When have you got to go? Soon. - Preston? - Mm? It's got to be settled. One way or another, it's got to be settled. This way, it... seems so underhand. - I feel... - I'll settle it. You've said that so many times. I'm not blaming you. But you have said it over and over. I want you to be sure. I'm a lot older than you, Georgie. I don't want you to make a mistake. How can you say that? You're all I want. But I don't want part of you. I hate all this hiding away. I'll tell her, Georgie. It's been a wonderful day. It could be like this always. I'll tell her. I'll tell her tonight. (Music playing) - (Knocking at door) - Hello? - Hello, Amy. - Harold's going to be late tonight. - So, we'll meet at the pub, OK? - Fine. You're looking mighty pleased with yourself. What's going on? It's for Jimbo. Thought I'd surprise him. - Ooh, looks good. - Should be. Cold ham, cold beef and cold pork. Got it at the complete shop. You can spend a week's money in that place. You're telling me. I started to save for new curtains. But a man likes a good meal of an evening, especially before a few beers. - Evening, Hilda. Hi, Mum. - Hello, Bri. Hope Dad won't be late for supper. I've got to meet Christine. - We've got tickets for Chris Barber. - Sauces! Bye-bye, now. See you at the Cricketers. I think Billy Dean might be playing tonight, Mrs Jackson said. Could have a bit of a singsong. Jimbo likes a bit of a singsong. (Crowd) # I'd like to meet him With his new sweetheart # Then up will go Antonio And his ice-cream cart... - There's nothing like those old songs. - No, nothing. - You all right now? Better? - Yes, thank you. Good. Mrs Barker. She had nasty turn. Heart. What did you say? I didn't say anything. I was agreeing with you. - Agreeing with me? - About the old songs. - You said there's nothing like 'em. - No. That's Billy Dean. They say he's ever so good. - He had an audition with the BBC. - (Crowd singing) # Oh, Antonio # He's gone away # Left me all alone-ee-oh # All on my own-ee-oh... What's the matter, Jimbo? Do you want to go? After this. Why? Aren't you feeling well? If you're not feeling well... I'm all right. Because if you're not feeling well, we can go home now, this minute. I'm all right. I just want to talk to you, that's all. What about? What about, Jimbo? Not here. - You're not in any trouble, are you? - No, it's not that. - Because if you're in any trouble... - Come on, Amy. Drink up. - Hello, Amy. Evening, Jim. - Oh, hello, Harold. - Saved you a seat. - Thanks. It's Billy Dean playing. Oh, lovely. - We can't go. Doesn't matter, does it? - No, no, it's all right. - You're sure? You're quite sure? - It's all right. It doesn't matter. Love you. (Yawns) Honestly, I haven't enjoyed myself so much in months. Honestly. Oh, I do think Billy Dean's marvellous, don't you, Hilda? - Good night, Hilda. Good night, Harold. - Night, Hilda. The key. - Night, Harold. - Night. I don't think I'll bother with my hair tonight. I'm too tired. - (Door shuts) - Oh, that'll be Bri. - That you, Bri? - (Brian) Yes, Mum. There's some cold meat in the cupboard and cheese. Pie if you want it. Oh, no, the pie's all gone. Don't take too much milk. I'm short. - Did you have a good time tonight, son? - Oh, yes, sonic. Good night, love. Good night, Mum. Good night, Dad. Night, Brian. Mm. I shan't need any rocking tonight. What were you gonna say to me at the Cricketers tonight? Just before Hilda came in. Did you notice how unhappy she was? Reckon she'd been rowing with Harold. Did you notice? - She did seem a bit off. - A bit? They're heading for trouble, those two. The clock's on for seven, all right? I can see it coming. It's the baby I feel sorry for. - (Grunts) You look tired. - Hm. Don't let's talk tonight, mm? (Yawning) Whatever it is, it can wait till tomorrow, can't it? Yes. Yeah, it can wait. Mm. Mm. Don't forget to put out the lights, Bri! (Brian) OK, Mum. - Night, Jimbo. - Night. (Clock ticking) (Vehicle sounds horn) (Jazz plays on radio) Breakfast, Jimbo! (Vehicle sounding horn) And as requested, we have pleasure in enclosing price list for specially selected quality imported softwoods. Thanking you for your past business and assuring you of our desire to be of service at all times, we are yours faithfully, et cetera. That's all, Miss Barlow. (Ship's horn sounding) You didn't tell her? - Georgie... - No, Preston. Please don't try and explain. (Whispers) Please don't. (lndistinct chatter) (Ship's horn) I waited lunch for you. Where have you been? Been offered a new job. I... I went to see about it. (Clock chiming) (Clock chiming) - Come on, you can buy me a pint. - No. All you think you have to do is put your hand on my arm and say, "Come on, you can buy me a pint" and I'll come running. - No, Preston. - Georgie, all day I wanted to explain. What is there to explain? You can't tell her, that's all. You can't tell her! I tried to tell her but it just wasn't the right moment. Oh, it's no good, Preston. I don't mean to keep putting it off, but it's got to be the right moment. You think I don't understand? I do. We can't go on like this! Georgie! If only she was different, it would be easier to tell her. But Amy isn't a bad person. In her own way, she tries. She wasn't always like this. When we were first married, she was... Perhaps it's my fault. The thing is, I never noticed she'd changed till I met you. You see the same person every day, you don't see them at all. But women shouldn't be like that, not bothering once they're married. - That's when you should bother most. - It's easier to say. I'm sorry for her too, Preston. I am, really. But it's your life I'm thinking of. I look at you now, unhappy and worried, and I could weep. Yes, I could weep. I want to give you some happiness, confidence. I want to take care of you. So, please, for your own sake, you must break with her. I know you're right, but... Oh, what's the use? I've had the offer of that job. I'm gonna take it! Georgie, you can't leave me! You mustn't! Look, look, I promise. I promise I'll tell her tonight. - That's what you said last night! - Whatever happens, I'll tell her tonight. I promise you, Georgie. (Ship approaching) (Ship sounds horn) Come on, I'll buy you that pint. (lndistinct chatter) Thanks. Preston? Hm? You know back there when I was going to leave you? I couldn't have done it. I don't think I could find the strength to give you up now. You'd find the strength to do anything, Georgie, anything you thought was right. No. To cut out your own heart, that needs strength, more than I've got. You know what I'm trying to say. That I've got to go through with it? I know, Georgie, I know. More than that. I... l'm trying to say, don't let me make you do anything you'd regret. I don't want to drive you, Preston. I think it's right for both of us, but don't do it for me. Don't do it because you're afraid of... of losing me. Tell her because it's right. It's the only way. I've got it straight, Georgie. I want to do it. I'm going to do it. (Music on radio) (Footsteps) - (Music on radio) - If it wasn't for the baby, I'd leave him. Oh, get away with you, Hilda! How do you like my Jimbo? Working late nearly every night. Weekends as well. It's different for you, Amy. You like staying in. I don't. Oh, what's the use? All men are selfish. Not all of them. Oh, your Jim, you mean? He's got his faults, but he's not selfish. No one could call him selfish. Don't you worry, girl. I know how it is. When you're first married, you want your man with you all the time. But they always say the first 50 years are the worst. (Amy laughing) - Mum! - (Amy) Coming! Just coming! I promised Bri I'd have his tea ready on the table. Now, you cheer up. Put a little something on your face and let Harry see you don't care. - (Music off) - Oh, there you are, Mum. Is tea ready? In two ticks. I'm all behind today. You get washed. I'll have it ready, time you are. - I told you I'd be in a hurry tonight, Mum. - You're not going out again tonight, Bri? Mum, I told you I was. I was gonna give you a nice bit of steak but our butcher's was shut. - I'll do you some eggs. - All right, but hurry. - (Piano plays single notes) - (Woman) 'Billy, get away from there.' (Man) 'They have a long history of conflict with the law.' - (Radio static) - Mum, for once! Just for once, can't we listen to our own voices? - (Big band plays on radio) - Just finding a bit of music. - What time's Dad coming in? - Soon, I expect. Why? They're holding a debate at the club tonight and I'm speaking for the motion. You're making a speech? I mean, an actual speech? Why not? I've done it before. Well, what do you want your dad for? I just thought he might run over my notes, see? Couldn't I help? Do you believe a scientist's loyalty to humanity is more important than his loyalty to his own country? I'll get your tea. Tea, tea. Tea, tea. Postcard from your Aunt Ethel, Bri! She's at Hastings. - What does she say? - Wonderful weather, she says. Ooh, your eggs. - Mum, you didn't iron my grey shirt. - I'll iron it while you're eating. I can air it by the fire. - What fire? - I only lit it half an hour ago. Eggs, eggs! I don't know what you do all day. Well, I like that! I've been on my feet since seven this morning! If you think you can do any better, why don't you stay home and try? I'd like to see you! Tea. Tea. Tea, tea. Tea and coffee. - What shirt's that? - My brown one. That shirt's been good to you, Bri. You've had it two years at least, and it wasn't here. I shan't wait to eat now, Mum. I want to speak to Christine before the debate. I'll have something later. Your young woman can wait. You're not going out with nothing in your stomach. - I haven't got time to wait, I... - Wait. Bit of cotton. That means you'll have a letter. I'm sorry I wasn't ready with your tea today, Bri. I swore I'd be ready today. All right, Mum, don't worry. Don't be late. Love to Christine. (Door shuts) (Flames crackling) Ooh, no. Bri's right. I must organise. Jimbo's supper. Fire. Light the fire. (Classical music playing) (Classical music playing) - That you, Jimbo? - (Jim) Who else? (Classical music continues playing) Jimbo. Look, all ready. No waiting, not a minute. - I made up my mind. - Good service. I made up my mind that today it would all be ready. Fillet of plaice and chips and apple tart. Apple tart with cream. I got the cream from the milkman today. - Smells good. - Oh, I can do it. If I set my heart to do something, I can usually do it. Amy, I'm not all that hungry. Jimbo! You'll do just as you're told. Eat. (Classical music continues playing) - All right? - Yeah, it's fine. (Sighs) I tried a new way with the chips. Cook 'em for a minute or so then take 'em out. Leave 'em for another minute and then put 'em back. - What does that do? - It makes them crisp. Don't you think it makes them crisp? (Chuckles) Yeah. - (Classical music continues playing) - It's Tchaikovsky. Makes me want to cry. You know that? It's so sad. Switch it off, will you, Amy? - Don't you like it? - No, I'm not in the mood. - (Music off) - (Woman) 'Billy, get away from there! ' Mrs Thompson having trouble with her Billy. He's a handful, he is. You know she's expecting again? - Again? That'd be her fifth. - No, sixth. You know the man came round today, canvassing for Labour? You know what she told him? She told him she'd had enough labour to last her a lifetime. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Oh, I've burnt the fish. No, no, I'm just not hungry, that's all. - I did burn it. - Well, a little. Haven't touched your pie. I'm just not hungry, that's all. I've got past it. Simpson's been chasing you. I can always tell. Doesn't he know when he's got a good man? I'd like to see you walk out on him. That's what I'd like to see. - I'd like a cup of tea, Amy. - I've got something better than that. (Mrs Thompson) 'Billy! Billy, come here! I want you! ' - Look. - (Mrs Thompson) 'Billy! ' You're spoiling me tonight. How much do you want to borrow? I think you deserve it. I've got a good husband and a good son and a nice home. Sometimes I like to show I appreciate my good fortune. Some day, I'm gonna surprise you. I'm gonna just walk up to you with my arms full of pound notes and shake 'em all over you like confetti or snow. That competition! Huh! - You'll never win it if you live to be 101! - How can you be so sure, Jimbo? - Somebody's got to win it. - Not us, not us. - We're not the lucky type. - Well, someone's got to. Yeah, someone, someone! But not us, not you and me. Only a shilling. No harm in trying for a shilling. No harm? No, there's no harm, no harm in anything! But it'd make a nice change to come home once, just... just once, and find the place tidy! - So, you've finished your ironing? - Not yet. Jimbo, sit down. You're tired. Oh, for... Either finish that damned ironing or put it away! Just to find the place tidy! (Piano plays single notes) (Shouting outside) No need to shout at me, Jimbo. What's wrong? - What is it? - Nothing. Don't tell me it's nothing. You always say that. Must be something. I'm tired, that's all. I'm tired and I want to think. That's Simpson. Don't think I can't tell. In the next world, he'll have a lot to answer for. No, it isn't Simpson. Listen, Amy. It's chilly in here. Shall I switch the fire on for you? - What? - Do you want the fire on? No, no. I'm sorry, Amy. I didn't mean to go for you like that. You're right, Jimbo. I know you're right. I try and get the place looking tidy but somehow... - It's me. I will try. I really will. - No, Amy, it isn't... I know I've said it before but this time I... Do you know what, Jimbo? Mrs Harper next door told me something this morning that opened my eyes. I know what's wrong with me. I've got mineral deficiency. It's the lack of iron in my blood. She's gonna get me a jar of black molasses. That's like black treacle. And she says if I take two tablespoonfuls every day... Amy, you've got to divorce me. You've got to give me a divorce. Divorce? You're joking, Jimbo? No, I'm not, Amy. For weeks, I've been trying to tell you this. For months. You're always... playing jokes, pulling my leg. - Jimbo. - I'm not joking, Amy. No. Be a dreadful thing to joke about. Yeah. I'm not joking. - Leave that, Amy. - You said... Leave it. Come and sit down a moment. You meant what you said, Jimbo. You really meant it. Amy, look. Come and sit down and we can talk. Is it Georgie? Yes. Georgie. No one's to blame, Amy, not one of us. Georgie's no home-breaker. It just... well, it just happened. You read about this happening to other people. You never think one day it could be you. Jimbo, what about Bri? Have you thought about Bri? He's old enough to understand. Is he? I'm his mother and I don't understand. - (Whispers) Georgie. - It's not only Georgie, Amy. She's only part of it, you see. It's my whole life. It's leading nowhere. I feel I'm living in a blind alley. You mean I hold you back? That's what you mean, isn't it? Georgie, she's younger, she's got brains, she's educated. What do you know about Georgie? You only met her once for about five minutes. You could make your way with her, get on in the world. No, that's not the way to put it, Amy. I... we've not been really happy. Jimbo, how can you make such a statement? We've hardly had a cross word in all our married lives. Look, look, Amy! I'm trying to say this without hurting you. Say it! A few more words won't matter! Then listen! Well? No, leave it. Leave it. - Tomorrow we'll talk about it quietly. - No. Tell me now, Jimbo. Tell me what I did wrong. Tell me what I did. Eh, Jimbo? Please tell me what I did wrong. - (Chatter) - It's Bri and... It's Bri. Mustn't let them see. - Hello! Hello! - Hello, Dad. Hello, you two! Hello, what have you got here? Got a new... Christie's got a new record. - It's really groovy. - Do you want to hear it? - Yes, yes. - OK. - Come on, take your coat off, Christine. - Thank you. What about some food, Mum? We're starving. Come on, Mum. Stop dreaming. We're hungry. (Record player playing jazz ensemble) There's some pie. (Record player playing jazz ensemble) (Smash) (Record player playing jazz ensemble) (Music playing outside) (Retching) (Gasping) (Sobbing) (Sobbing) Dad? - She's OK, don't you think, Dad? - Christine? Yes, she's a nice kid. - (Clock chiming) - Is Mother asleep? Yes, bad headache. She's taken some aspirin. - She should have said something. - Shh. I hope we didn't make it worse playing all those records. - No. Good night, son. - Good night, Dad. (Birds chirping) (Clock ticking) (Radio playing upbeat jazz) (Kettle whistling) (Radio playing upbeat jazz) (Radio playing romantic classical music) You didn't eat your egg! I did it four minutes. The egg was fine. I just didn't want it. I'm late, darling. Got to rush. You never could do your tie properly. You know that? Never. - Look, I'm late, Amy. - Jimbo? Jimbo, you're not to worry. I made up my mind about that. We'll work it out all right. You're not to worry, you hear me? Yes. Didn't notice what I did this morning? Six o'clock I was up working. Ironing all done. I heard you. I didn't sleep either. Bri? Bri, you'll be late. Breakfast is ready. - You'll be home early? - Not too early. Simpson wants the blasted books made up so he can take 'em home at the weekend. Jimbo, try and make it early tonight. - I don't want to sit here tonight... - I'll try. Jimbo, I've been thinking, really hard. If you could give it another chance, I know I could alter... Amy, I can't talk about it now! I've got to go! You will think about it though, Jimbo? It's been a long time all these years. - If we've got through so far... - Amy, please! I've got enough on my mind with Simpson. That Simpson's the whole trouble, if you ask me. Everybody has their ups and downs, Jimbo. The Wallaces were gonna split up, remember? And that came out all right. Morning, Mrs Preston. Morning, Jim. - Jimbo? - Amy, it's no good, no good talking now. But you'll think about what I said? That's all I'm asking. - I promise. - I just know it's gonna be all right. - Amy, I've got to go. - Jimbo? (Baby wailing nearby) I've been thinking, Jimbo. I've been working out all kinds of plans. I know... - Amy, what's the use? - But you'll listen, won't you? I won't make a fuss or anything. Just to talk. - Will it do any good, Amy? Will it help? - It will help me. All right, then. Anything you say. We'll talk it all out. Now I'm late already. I'll have everything shining, really tidy! I'm gonna make a real effort, you'll see! Don't be late! Jimbo! (Big band playing on radio) I say! We are tidy this morning. I've been up since six. - On one of your annual bursts? - Don't, Bri. Come on. I'm only kidding. - (Volume down) - What's the matter, Mum? I wanted to say something special to your father. He's gone. Cheer up. There's always the telephone. Course. There you are. Bacon and egg this morning. It's not broken and it's not burnt. - All right? - It's fine. Tastes just like bacon and eggs. Bri, have you got any money? I want to borrow some. I want to get my hair done, get one or two things. - I'll pay you back at the weekend. - Come off it, Mum. You know how much I get paid at the factory. I thought you were saving for a suit. - If you could just lend me... - Mum, no! Besides, why the sudden concern over your looks? You've done without hairdos all this time. It's a bit late to start now, isn't it? - Never mind, I'll manage. - I didn't mean it like that. It's all right. It's all right. Don't go making a martyr out of yourself. Here, look, glamour girl. Here's ten bob. Present. Go on, take it. It's in a good cause. You'll see. Four bob. I haven't got time for any more, Mum. I'm late. - What's up? - Nothing! - Bye, then. - Mind how you go! (Ship's horn sounds) (Footsteps) You told her? What did she say? What could she say? Poor Preston. Poor Amy. (Buzzes) Simpson and Ross? Could I speak to Mr Preston, please? Who's calling, please? Oh, his wife. 'Mrs Preston.' It's rather urgent. Who's that? Miss Barlow here, Mrs Preston. Oh. I want to speak to Jimbo. One moment, please. Amy. Jimbo? I... l've been thinking. I want you to do me a favour. No, don't say no, because it's important to me. Jimbo? I want you to bring her, Georgie, back with you tonight. Amy, no! I... I won't make a scene or create. I just want that we should all talk properly. - (Amy) 'Ask her, Jimbo, please.' - (Jim) Amy, I can't. Jimbo, you've got to. It's not much to ask. Jimbo, please! Please! I shan't let you down, really. All right, I'll try. I won't promise, Amy. 'But I'll try.' Thank you, Jimbo. I know it'll be all right. Honestly, you won't regret it. Amy, I must go! Oh, sorry for disturbing you, Jimbo. I had to ask you. See you tonight, then. (Buzzes) (Buzzes) We can go to my place for lunch. We'll have time. We can talk there. (Ship's horn outside) - (Shop bell rings) - It's not exactly new, is it? You've been bringing it here for at least six months. Well, it's nearly new. 15, eh? 15? It's more than my job's worth. Ten's the limit. (Woman) Oh, all right, all right. Give me a ticket. - Do you want a hanger? - I want it taken care of. Penny for a hanger. Tuppence for brown paper. I know. There you are. Yes? Um... l've got a ring. - This is your own property, of course? - It's my engagement ring. Had it for years. Never been off my finger till this morning. - How much? - Oh. I don't know what he paid for it. It was dear, I know that. No, I mean how much do you want on the ring? Oh, I see. Um... - (Vehicle outside sounds horn) - Well, I hadn't thought. - Three pounds? - Oh, yes. Three pounds will be very suitable. - Name and address, please? - Um... Mrs Preston. Never been in your shop before. I've passed it often, of course. It's very nice. I expect you're always busy. It's a beautiful ring. I'll pay you back very soon and take it back again. I feel so strange about it. It's very nice of you to help me. I want the money for a sort of surprise, see? Yes, madam? Can I help you? You... you do ladies' hair? Do you want to make an appointment? It's... You see, I... (Sighs) It's rather difficult. I know it's asking a lot, but could you do me now? I'd be really grateful. We're full right up, I'm afraid, madam. I couldn't fit you in at such short notice. - It wouldn't take long, would it? - I'm sorry, madam. - Miss Joy? - Oh, are you the manageress? I was just saying to this young lady I've got the money. It's just that I must have it done. I... l've got it all planned. I must have it done for tonight. All right, Miss Joy, I'll attend to this lady. I'm sorry, madam. I'm afraid we're behind with our appointments as it is. Couldn't you... I mean, it's hard to explain. But I've got... l've got a very urgent personal reason, personal. - Well, I really don't see how... - I tell you what I want. I... I want it set like they're wearing it now. I wouldn't ask, only it's so important, important to me. I just want it set. - It needs more than a set, madam. - Ooh, no. I don't want anything too special, you understand. Please. It's a special occasion, is it? Very well, madam. I'll give you a shampoo and set. But it wants more than that, really. A perm. But still... Oh, thank you, thank you ever so. I'm really grateful. Well, perhaps you'd go into that end cubicle and I'll send someone to you as soon as I can. My hair used to be so pretty, you know that? It used to be my best feature. I've told you, Georgie. I don't like you coming back this evening. What good can it do? It can only embarrass all of us. But she was pleading with you on the telephone. Can't refuse the only thing she's ever asked of us. It's not right. This has got to be settled between Amy and me. - It concerns me too. - Oh, please, Georgie. - Please try to understand. - I do understand. But I think without me you're not very good at fighting. I want to be there tonight. I must be. It will be so wonderful after this evening. We... we can start planning everything. We'll be so happy, so very happy. Oh, that's much better, madam. A credit to any occasion. Thank you very much. (Mouths) Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you very much. Bye. - Oh, thank you. Good day, madam. (Vehicle sounds horn) Oh. Could you tell me, please, how much is a bottle of whisky? - 37 shillings. - Oh. You can have a half bottle, 18 and 9. Would that be enough for three people? - It all depends how much they drink. - Oh, yes. Well, my husband likes a drop of whisky and I thought for a treat... Yes, I'll take it, please. - It's good whisky, isn't it? - None better. - Would you like some soda water? - Soda water? Oh, yes, I think I'd better. That'll be 22 and 6. Oh, is that the time? (Vehicle sounds horn) (Baby crying) (Man) Hurry along, please. Hurry along, please. - Give us time, won't you? - No more upstairs. Inside only. Inside only. Inside only. Inside only. Sorry, madam. Full up. (Bell rings) - Get to the back of the queue. - But I was... My hair. Just had it done. Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me! Do you mind a moment? Thank you. You don't mind? You see, my hair... (Orchestral music playing on radio) (Sneezes) (Orchestral music playing on radio) When it's dry. Be better when it's dry. Oh! (Grunts) (Gasping) (Music stops) (Music starts) Oh! - (Knock at door) - Who is it? Amy! Amy, what is it? - Tell me. - I'd got everything planned. I was gonna be so cool and get the place so nice with drinks and everything. I wanted to show him I could do it. - I wanted to look nice. - You do look nice. I mean, if we fix your hair and get you a dress. It was the rain. Today of all days, it had to rain! Here, slip this on. (Amy sniffs) - You had a row with Jim? - He wants to leave me. Oh, nonsense. It's a girl at his office. He wants to divorce me. And what you want is some of this whisky. - No, no, that's for Jimbo! - Drink it. He doesn't deserve it. (Coughs and gasps) (Both laughing) I must look a sight! - Terrible! - Waste of money! - I could have paid the insurance. - Insurance? You pay it for 50 years so your relations can get blind at your funeral. Talk about it, Amy. Nothing to talk about. He says it's all settled. Settled? My old man left my mother. Did I ever tell you? He did, just scarpered. She lost a stone and a half in a fortnight. Then one morning she took a look at herself in the mirror. Got such a shock. She decided she'd got to snap out of it. Know what she did? She got herself a pan of hot water and scrubbed the place out, straight up. She started putting on weight from that moment. Men are all the same. When they want you, they can't do enough. But when they've got you it's like the never-never. They think they've paid after the first instalment. Jimbo's not like that. I know he loves me. But he's in love with her. There's a world of difference. (Orchestral music playing on radio) Hilda? I've got to lay the table, got to get everything tidy. I've got to be ready. - Ready? - For Jimbo and... Jimbo and Georgie. They're coming back here to talk. I've got to be ready. - Can I help? - No! Run along. I'll be better by myself. - You sure now? - Yes. You mustn't leave the baby too long. You run along. Better by myself. Now pull yourself together, girl. Oh. Ooh. I wonder if there's any left. Oh, yeah. A little for Jimbo. No, a little more for Jimbo. A little for her. A little for me. Just right. Oh. - (Music stops) - Well, I won't need any. (Coughs) Knives and forks. Spoons. (Hiccups) Pardon. Granted. # Oh, oh, Antonio! # He's gone away... Tablecloth. # Oh, oh, the tablecloth! # He's gone away - # He left... - (Clock beeping on radio) (Beeping and crackling) # I'd like to meet him # With his new sweetheart... # And off will go Antonio With his ice cream cart # Oh, oh, Antonio, he's gone... Sauces for Jimbo. (She grunts) (Glass clinking) (Sighs) # I'd like to meet him With his new sweetheart... (Gasping) Oh. (Sobs) ("Oh, Oh, Antonio" plays in her head) (Piano playing out of tune) (Piano playing out of tune) Gasps) (Door shuts) (She sobs) Mum! Mum, what's happened? Come on, Mum, stand up. Mum. - Come and lay down on the bed. - (She sobs) Here we are. Mum? Mum! Mum, what's the matter? (Brian) Mum! Mum! - Mum! - I won't let you do it, Jimbo! (Amy) Jimbo! Jimbo, please! I won't! I won't let you do it, Jimbo! I won't! - What's happening, Brian? - Dad, something's wrong with Mum! Yes, all right. (Jim) Go on, close that door. (Amy sobbing) Amy, Amy. Amy, Amy, it's me. It's me, Amy. - It's Jim. - (Sniffs) Jimbo. I did try. My hair... I don't drink usually. You know that, Jim. Shh. Yes, Amy. Now, don't you worry. You just lie there and have a good sleep. (Sniffing) I have just a drop of beer now and then but spirits never. - Shh. - You've never known me to have spirits. You get some sleep now. You'll be all right. You... you just get some sleep. - I... - Shh. - (Sobs) - Shh. (She cries) Oh, come in, Georgie. Er... Brian, this is Georgie. Hello. What happened, son? I don't know. I just got home from work. Had any food? Let me get you something. Georgie, make a cup of tea, will you? What's she doing here? I brought her home to meet your mother. Dad, why should Mum get drunk? I'm not a child, Dad. What's going on? Nothing. Nothing. Pull the other leg. It's got bells on. Now, listen, Brian. You were damned rude just now. You just watch your manners. Are you walking out on Mum, Dad? I'm only your son, I know, but I'd like to know where I stand. Nothing's settled, nothing. It's true, then, is it? You're really leaving Mum? I tell you nothing's settled! Now, will you shut up about it? Of all the dirty filthy mean bloody tricks! Brian. - Yes, Dad? - Where are you going? Don't worry. I'll be back. Don't ever lay a finger on me again. Don't ever do it, Dad. He's bound to be upset. He'll get over it. I never raised my hand to him before in all my life. You're tearing up roots. Did you expect it to be painless? And Amy, she never touched spirits. Never, never. Preston, listen to me. You mustn't weaken. You draw back now, you're finished. It's Simpson and... and this for the rest of your life. You're not listening to me. It's not myself I'm fighting for, it's you. I know, Georgie. It's just that I seem to be hurting so many people. Don't blame yourself. I know you wouldn't hurt anyone if you could avoid it. It ought to be possible to be happy without trampling on people. It ought to be, but it isn't. Supposing after I'm gone, suppose she tried to harm herself? If I left her and that happened, how could I ever forgive myself? If that did happen, which it won't, you couldn't be held responsible. And if you don't leave her, you're the one committing suicide. You know the right thing to do. You have to do it. You're always so sure! So dead sure. How do you know you're right about me? How do you know I'm not in my right pigeonhole? Little brain, little initiative, little office clerk. I know differently. I know you. I love you. Georgie, this is her home. If only she weren't so helpless, if only she were a bitch, it'd all be so easy. Stick to what we said. It'll be all right. (He snorts) I wish I were better at explaining things. Oh, I can write a good business letter, and get the words out, click, click, click, just like that. But in my family, feelings... Iove and all that, were things you just didn't talk about. That's why I've made such a mess of things. Trying to make Amy understand, that I love you and... want to be with you. Always. What's the use? I know I just make it sound stupid. You don't make it sound stupid at all. (Kettle whistling) (Kettle whistling) (Door clicks) (Kettle whistling) Amy! You shouldn't be up. I'm better up. I'll be all right. Georgie's making some tea. Georgie? Oh, yes, Georgie. You got a handkerchief? (Blows nose) - Oh. - Can I bring you some aspirin? No, I'll be all right. Must look terrible. No, tired. You look done in. I was gonna surprise you. It's funny. Had my hair done today. First time I've had it done in a shop for... oh, years. And I was gonna put on my best dress. You know my special dress? That's why I bought the... whisky. So that we could drink and talk together like we said, like civilised people. And it all went wrong, Jimbo. Everything went wrong. It doesn't matter, Amy. You know my special dress? The zip broke. Ah, I couldn't mend it. Oh, my hair. They did it so nice. I would like you to have seen my hair after they did it. - It doesn't matter. - It matters to me! I wanted to look... to surprise... (Sighs) No, it doesn't matter. I suppose it doesn't matter. (Door clicks) Oh, I... shouldn't let you do that in my house. - You sit down and... - No, you sit down. We'll manage. I was telling Jimbo. Planned it all to be so different. Sit down. Sit down. We'll let it stand a minute. Please don't worry. We can have our talk another evening. - When you feel better. - No. No, I'm all right now. - It might be better to leave it. - (Amy) No. No, it's got to be settled. There isn't really all that much to say. Takes 20 years to build a home and you can break it up in five minutes. That's the truth, whatever way you look at it. Mrs Preston, we didn't ask this to happen. You didn't ask, but it happened! You could have said he's someone else's husband! You could have said he belongs to someone else. You could have got out of that office and left him alone, but you didn't! - Amy, we won't get anywhere like this. - Let her speak. You're so calm, cool. Jimbo always said how efficient you were. You look at me and you feel so efficient. Amy, where's this leading? Georgie came here because you asked her to. I had a pretty figure once. He'll tell you that. Right up till our second was born. June, we called her. Did you know we had another baby besides Bri? Preston told me. Preston! Preston! His name's Jim! Jimbo! You're not a schoolteacher calling a register. We lost June. It's a terrible thing when you think of it. She only lived half an hour. It's when I lost my pretty figure. Women do. It happens sometimes when they've had children. You might lose yours if you have children! Georgie and I have talked this over. I'll leave at the weekend. - Now, about money. - I don't want any money from you. - Why wait until the weekend? - Well, we thought... She thought, you mean! She's done all the thinking. I've lived too long with you. I know you. You couldn't do this on your own. The weekend, then? Of course, of course! It's all organised, like borrowing a cup of sugar! You walk into someone's house and you say, "Excuse me! "Will it be all right if I take your husband at the weekend? "Will that be convenient?" You're like a fish. I look at you and I see a fish. Cold, without feeling. And when I think I was going on my knees to you! Yes, I was. That's why I asked him to bring you here. I was gonna beg you to give him up. Oh, I had it all worked out. I was even gonna offer to share him. Anything, as long as he could stay here. - I was going on my knees to you! - Amy, that's enough! What does a woman like you want with a man like him? He's not handsome or clever. He won't make any fortunes. He'll be old in ten years. What did you pick on him for? - I love him. - You love him. You want to sleep with him, that's what you want! Love? You don't know the meaning of the word! Do you know that he snores? That he loses his temper if his paper's creased? He can't stand the sunshine, has to sit in the shade. Gets rheumatism every winter. That he smothers the food you've cooked in sauce, whatever it is, whole dollops of sauce. You know a thousand things about him. I know a million. That's what being married means. To know a man inside out and still love him. I'm sorry. I can't see any point in my staying. Georgie, wait! Amy, be fair! Be fair? You say that to me? Be fair? Yes, I do! You talk about me and my fortunes as if there was only one side to it. Heaven knows I'm no angel, but I've tried, Amy. For years, I've tried to make something of our life. I've worked. For what? For this? You call this a home? It's just a roof over your head. - But we've been happy, Jimbo. - (He snorts) - Well, you say we've been happy. - It isn't happiness now, Amy. Years ago, perhaps. But not now. Now it's just habit. We're married and we've learnt the habit of living together, that's all. You never told me, not once. I thought you loved me. Oh, I do, Amy. I do love you. But in a different way now. There's only one way to love. - I'll go, Preston. - Wait! He can go with you. - You want that, Amy? - Course I want it. What do you take me for? The quicker, the better. I don't need you any more, Jimbo. I can work. I can find a job. Brian and me, we'll manage, manage well. Maybe this is the best thing that could happen to me. For years I haven't thought of myself, only of you. Now it's changed. You go tonight. I want you out of my home, with her, tonight! All right, then, if that's the way you feel about it. I'm sorry, Amy. Don't be sorry. That's too soft, sentimental. Won't go down well with her! I'll pack a case. Wait downstairs! Downstairs! Mrs Preston. You won't believe this. I am deeply sorry. Yes. Sit down a minute. I'll help him pack. He never knows where to find anything. Um... I don't mean to be unkind, but... when you saw what was happening, couldn't you... somehow have found the strength to leave him alone? You're so pretty. So attractive. You could have anyone. You've got your whole life in front of you. Jimbo's not for you. I'm not just saying that. I know him. He's... he's weak like me. We make a pair. You make me sick. You mustn't think too badly of your father. I don't. I just want to know what kind of a... woman you are. What kind of a woman could do this to my mother, to our family? That's all I want to know. People can't help their feelings. - You make me sick. - You're young. You pray. You pray hard it never happens to you like this. Socks. I'll darn your others, have your shirts and things cleaned up. Remember... remember to... Amy, there's still a lot to settle. Brian and money. The divorce. Brian will decide for himself. The divorce, you must do what you think best. About money, I told you I don't want any. Mrs Harper's promised to help me get a job. - Amy, you don't want to work. - Oh, yes, yes, I do, Jimbo. I meant what I said in there. I see so many things now. I need to work. I'm not gonna sit down and weep for the rest of my life. This old case, it's seen better days. That's that. Good luck, Jimbo. You'd better go. She's waiting for you. Where is she? She said she'd wait for you downstairs. Say goodbye to your father, Bri. He's leaving. Goodbye, Dad. (Door shuts) I'll look after you, Mum. We'll be together. Both of us. He was in such a hurry to get to her, he didn't even take his case. He'll be back for it. I'll leave it outside. I'll pick them up, Mum. No, you get some tea. Get some fresh tea. (Clock chiming) (Clock chimes the hour) (Clock chimes the hour) It's no use, Georgie. You're right. I'm no good at fighting. But now you don't have to fight any more. Leaving her just now, she seemed... so helpless. Perhaps she's what she is because I'm what I am. I can't do it, Georgie. - (Dog barks in the distance) - I can't. I've got to go back. You haven't got to do anything, Preston. You mean it's what you want to do. It's what I've got to do, Georgie. Like I always said, you can't bear hurting anyone, least of all her. Look what I've done to you. I should have known. I should have been stronger. Well, you're strong now. I always wanted you to be sure. All along, I wanted you to be sure. Now you are. What did she say? What did she say to make you change? It's just, it's been too long between Amy and me. I can't fight that. I can't fight that, Preston. Georgie. (Georgie sobs) (Sobbing) Please go. Please go before I beg you to stay. Forgive me, Georgie. Try and forgive me. Please don't say any more. Please go. (Departing footsteps) (Whispers) Preston. (Sighs) (Door closes) I've spilled your things. She's gone. You can't do it, you know. You can't throw 20 years of your life in a case and walk out. What can I say to you, Amy? Nothing to say, Jimbo. It's all right. Everything'll be all right. You'll see. All those things I said. I didn't mean to hurt you, Jimbo. I wouldn't hurt you, not on purpose. We'd none of us hurt each other on purpose. It'll be all right from now on. It'll be all right, I promise. You know what? I'm gonna scrap this old dressing gown. Honestly. I never realised till tonight how shabby it is. Anyway, a woman should dress. She shouldn't slouch around all day in an old gown. Place won't seem the same without it. Leave that. I'll do it later. You go and talk to Bri. (Door clicks) Dad? I've got to give another speech tomorrow. Will you have a look at my notes? Course I will. Let's see. Let's have a bit of music. - (Music plays) - (Radio static) (Orchestral music plays on radio) (Orchestral music plays on radio)
