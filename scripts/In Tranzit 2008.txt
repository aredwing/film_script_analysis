Colonel Pavlov - what a pleasure. Andrei... ...I've brought you some new medicine. How are the headaches? Any better? Olga's trying to find us some more work to do. So, while the camp is empty, you should get some more rest. She has to keep busy otherwise she remembers too much. Like all of us. Men? Germans? German men. Looks like Comrade Pavlov is playing one of his little jokes on us. The gate was open. The camp is empty, Captain. It isn't now, Lieutenant. There was 53. Sign here. You can always make an official complaint. It's bloody cold. We need those jackets. Not yet. They're just a bunch of women - They don't know what to do with us. Let's just see what happens. Wait. Don't shoot! You killed my whole family, you fuckers! You killed my whole family, you fuckers! Quiet! Quiet. The war is over. Please. This is for my sister! This is for Sasha! Get her off him! Get up! Get up! Walk! Walk! Move on! Bastards! Go! That was close. You could have got us all killed. He was a good guy. Heave! Come on, get him up. Those Russian bitches! What do you expect after what we did to them? Olga said 48 of them died in a mine in Sverdlovsk. We've to request more food. Natalia you don't really think we should look after them, do you? They were starved at that mine! That's what should happen to them here! Remember what we had to eat in Leningrad? Let them eat the same! They're swine. They're used to it. Schmidt? Yes. Schenfelder? No, Schoenfelder. Don't be cheeky! Vogel? Yes. Weber? Weber? Weber? That's Weber. Corporal Weber. Corporal Martin Heinrich Weber. Oh for God's sake, Olga, call her off! Vera, that's enough! Wirth? Yes. Nehring? Yes. Muller? Diarrhoea? We've all had it. Given what they fed us at the mine. Men have got painful joints, bleeding gums, loose teeth, scurvy... Are you a doctor? No. What is your name? Bort. Max Bort. What is wrong with him? He took some shrapnel in the head. They patched him up. Seems harmless enough. We're all harmless. Thank you. Get out of here before I report you! The good doctor. Thank you for permitting this. Colonel Pavlov, such a pleasure! The pleasure is all mine, Captain. Thank you. Though I have heard some rather unfortunate rumours. What is it, Colonel Pavlov? A little bird told me that... ...your prisoners are having the time of their lives. Is that true, Captain Olga Alexandrova? Most definitely not, Colonel Pavlov. Excellent! That's just what I wanted to hear, Captain. Now, I must go and see the prisoners' medical reports. Of course. Please. But I will see the doctor alone, thank you. Thank you, Comrade. We could do with the provisions we asked for, Comrade. And some more medicine. We won't survive the winter with what you sent so far. You underestimate yourselves, Comrade. How is Andrei? Andrei? I saw him out by the gate. Doing his usual tricks. He seemed better. Though, perhaps it might be best for both of you... ...if he were in a proper sanatorium. No, I can look after him better here. Well, I'm sure you can, Comrade. Listen, let me share something with you. Intelligence tells us that in this camp alone... ...there might be several high-ranking war criminals... ...hiding amongst the prisoners. The Party wants results. So we'll be keeping the Germans here until we achieve them. And I was thinking... ...that someone who got to know the prisoners personally... ...one might say intimately... ...might have the best chance of ascertaining the truth. Someone the prisoners trusted. Someone with integrity and... ...like, er, say a doctor, perhaps? What are you asking me to do, Comrade? What do you think I'm asking you to do, Comrade? Come on. Move on quickly. Move on, I said! Comrade Pavlov, rest assured our number one priority is... Come over here, child. Come. What is your name? Zin... I'm sorry - Citizen Tyomina. You were laughing so merrily. Why? Take off your coat. My coat? Yes. Take it off. Face me. Take off your blouse. And the brassiere. The brassiere, take it off. Now! Do it! Let your fascist boyfriend see. Ah, such a good doctor. I know exactly what's going on in this camp. Comrade Pavlov... I outrank you, Peter... ...so this is an order: stay away from her. Stay away from all of them... You never know what you might catch. He's right. Russian women are the Devil's own bitches. Not all of them. Some were quite sweet. You had Russian girlfriends? Hey, Muller -did I or did I not have Russian girlfriends, huh? Oh, yeah, farm-boy... ...I had Russian girlfriends all right. That was a direct contravention of orders. I carried out my orders, Klaus - don't you worry about that. Just didn't waste any bullets on them- that's all. You were lucky today. Keep your head down, and you might get out of here alive. All those German soldiers staring at her... ...like they'd never seen a real woman before! He knows something. He just likes to scare us. I wonder who his 'little bird' is. What did the two of you talk about? He just wanted to see the prisoners' medical reports, that's it. Don't tell me you suspect me? I suspect everyone. You save someone who knows, he may turn out to be a war criminal. You inform on someone else, he may be innocent... ...Pavlov hangs him anyway and you're not sent away. And it's all so very, very logical. - Out. Out! - Out! Quick! Out! Line up! Out! Quickly! Is this all of them? All present and correct. When you were taken prisoner... ...each of you was ordered to provide us with your full details. Some of you did not. Some of you lied, some of you invented new names. This was perfectly understandable... ...given the nature of your crimes. But for those of you who took part in... ...the terrible actions of the SS... ...a new name will be of no comfort to you. You will be found. And when we find you... ...you will be treated not as a prisoner of war... ...but as a war criminal. In 1941, in the occupied region of Leningrad... ...the 8th SS Division under the command... ...of a Colonel Heinrich Lombard... ...and with the aid of a Captain Erik Neivach... ...committed certain illegal acts. Together, they conspired to murder... ...Soviet citizens... ...men, women and children. Name? - Nehring - Arthur Nehring. - Name? - Nehring. - Name? Nehring. Name? Muller - Ernst Muller. Why are you nervous, soldier? He's scared. We're defeated. We're at your mercy. So - we're all scared. Yes. Nehring, Muller step forward. Captain Neivach. It was not me. It was him! He gave the orders! The Colonel... ...he's the one you want! It's not me, I'm innocent! Colonel Lombard. Rest assured, no-one... ...not one of you - will escape Soviet justice. Who's the prisoner with the scar over his eye? I don't know. You don't know his name? You should, for Andrei's sake. On May the 8th 1945... ...Fascist Germany surrendered to our heroic Soviet Army. We, the Soviet people... ...have shown the German prisoners great humanity. We spared their lives. We gave them shelter. We shared our food with them. We gave them the opportunity to exorcise their guilt. But some of them, because of the nature of their crimes... ...remain the enemies of the Soviet people. They tried to escape punishment. They were not successful. The time has come for these men to pay for their deeds. We'll get through this you and me. As long as we look out one for another. What do you mean? The doctor has a soft spot for you. She does. Trust me, I know these things. Breathe in. Deeply. Please turn around. It's a bullet wound. Anything wrong? No, you're fine. Good morning, doctor. Peter? Dead? Everybody dead. Dead, too? AII. My hands will never get used to this. They'll have to. We are just slaves, aren't we? Everyone is in the same boat. We'd better stick together - We are all we've got here. Bort! Report to the doctor's office immediately. He's to bring some tools. Ah, the doctor's office. At least I'll get out of this cold for a while. Lucky you. What's wrong? Are you afraid of rats? No. Are you? In Leningrad, the rats could hardly move. Just like the rest of us. We picked them up by their tails... ...and threw them on the stove and toasted them. Ate them, skin and all. Colonel Pavlov, the supplies are in order. This one's not very thin, is he? Positively overfed. Reduce their rations by one third. I can't have German prisoners fattening up... ...when Soviet citizens go hungry. The Soviet people have shown you great mercy. Far greater than any of you deserve. Of course, some of you may wish to atone for your crimes. Others of you are hoping... ...that you will escape punishment altogether. I can tell... What shall we do with the prisoners, Comrade? Let them stay out here and contemplate their crimes. You know, Comrade doctor... ...I feel you should keep a closer eye on your ailing husband. You're not as badly wounded as people think you are... ...are you, Andrei? Your wife's a very attractive woman. Is that upsetting for you... ...the fact that she's around men all day long? So - what did that son of a bitch have to say to Olga? Oi! We're all on the same side. Except, while we were starving in Leningrad... ...he and his cronies were hiding out in their cosy NKVD bunker. He and his cronies have the power to send you to Siberia. So, even in Siberia they need doctors. Compliments - from the 'son of a bitch'. No. Come on. Man, we all need a little vodka now and then. Pavlov was asking about Klaus Prompst... ...and Max Bort. He suspects them, so we're to keep an eye on them. And on Andrei, too. Andrei? Why? Why Andrei? Pavlov reckons he isn't up to the job. That Olga should replace him. No - if he goes, I go too. Calm down. He just thinks he'd be better off in a sanitorium, that's all. Oh, let me guess where that is. Siberia? We must all take care. Today's inspection wasn't something he dreamt up. Someone is informing on us. They will starve to death. We owe them nothing. We're not their executioners, either. Do you really think I give a shit about those Nazis? We still have a duty to the prisoners in our care. Then what we need is proper jobs... ...and proper food for them. And what about the railway depot? That crazy Jew? What about him? I'm sure Yakov could use the extra workers. You can have them as long as you like. Until they are transferred. I suppose it'll speed things up a bit. Are you sure you can feed them? Two meals a day, as promised. How did I come to be feeding Germans? It's going very well. They're hard-working - Efficient. Very - German, in fact. Yakov, the war is over. For them, maybe. I still miss so many things. Natalia... Sorry, Comrade. It's okay. Shouldn't a child like Zina know life's pleasures? Dancing. Lipstick. Music. I miss music. Imagine if we could make them put everything back the way it was. Every bridge, every building. Every dance hall. Do you remember the Annual Railway Yard Dance? Yes. Well, I still have all the music. And the decorations. I even have our musical instruments. All you need is an orchestra. What if... ...what if... ...we could add 'musical ability'... ...to 'hard-working' and 'efficient'? Germans come from the land of Beethoven and Brahms. There must be some musicians among them. Oh, what would Pavlov say? No, they've allowed music in some Moscow camps. Why not here? It'll be our project. We can give it a suitable name like... ...'International Ideological Corrective Activity'. You're, you're a genius. A genius! Dismissed! Come along, come along. We haven't got all day. That's it. Yes! I'm a Jew! He's a fucking Jew. So - what are you going to do about it? That's it, Hans. Come on. Good. If only you knew what it took not to use that as firewood during the siege. Good man. Please. Please. Maybe we should have joined the band, too. And what are you gonna play, farm-boy? What instrument do you play? Hmm? It's all right. Come with me. Go ahead. Well done. Now, play! No. No, no, not like that! Not like... Like that! Good. Go! Go. Take your instruments - repair them... ...and learn the songs you've been given. It's beautiful, isn't it? We need to talk. It's important. Your doctor friend's been asking me questions. About the war. About us. What did you tell her? Nothing. How about you? Do you think we can trust her? Why are you asking me? Because she likes you. And you like her. If we work together - and give her a few names... ...maybe we could get ourselves on a train back to Germany. How about Beckmeyer and Ritter? - Nobody will miss them. Beside, they're not going to last much longer. Or Dressler - That farm-boy's no good to anyone. Stay away from me! Think about it. Bort! Follow me! Doctor's orders. Time you decided which side you're on. I'm on my side. Remember, Max, I know who you are and who you were. I know what you're up to. Yes, come in! You wanted to see me? Russian rats are tougher than we thought. You shouldn't have done the job in the first place if you weren't up to it. I'll get my tools. Bort. What would you do to get out of here? Go home and see your wife? I won't betray my people. Your 'people' murdered innocent civilians. Tell me, how many did you kill? Hmm? How many children? If a girl with a live grenade came running at you... ...would you shoot her? So you killed little Russian girls? No. But I saw them kill and get killed. Go and get your tools. Do you really think I'm a killer of children? I don't know what to think any more. And what about Klaus Prompst? Is he a war criminal? Ask him yourself. Zina? Zina, where the hell are you? Zina! Natalia! Sugar! And potatoes! We will be arrested! Hung! What are you talking about? Come. Come. I had a delivery two days ago. And it's vanished into thin air! Look, see? This. That's it! And here. Pavlov will have me shot! Do you know anything about this? It's you! You thieving little... Zina, what's wrong? Nothing. I'm pregnant. You fucking whore! I still have to report it. Absolutely not, no. But Olga and Elena have to know. What do we have to know? I'll take care of it. Okay. Well? As your superior, I order you to tell me. Why, just so you can run off and inform Pavlov? What? You really want to know who the rat is? Here. It's number eight. You may recognise the handwriting. The doctor is a spy. She's working for the Nazis. Against the Soviet state. And she's poisoning me with pills. Andrei! No. No. But he doesn't know what he's doing. Maybe. But if I told Pavlov that... ...he would have him removed, right? Oh, no. Andrei? Someone has been trying to send false reports to Pavlov. It could get me a lot of trouble. No! No. Look. Look. Do you remember this? Look. We loved to dance. Do you see? Andrei. Andrei. It has to stop! Can they play? Some of them can. Comrade Pavlov. You know, it's early so it won't be difficult. No. Zina, you can't have the baby. I won't kill it! We have each other - We love each other. What else matters? Boyfriend. Stand up! Stand up! This is what happens to prisoners who steal food. Zinotchka! Natalia, you can do something. Help me! Help me! Please. Please. Comrade Pavlov... ...may I have a word? I think I know where the missing food might be. Where? Come with me, if you will. Where are the keys? The keys? Should I search for stolen potatoes these uniforms, Comrade? Excuse me. Arrest her! She's a collaborator! Arrest her! She's a collaborator! Comrade Pavlov... ...I have long suspected Corporal Tyurina of deviant behaviour. What? On many occasions she has mysteriously disappeared... ...and behaved erratically on her return. Stop it! Sergeant! Comrade Pavlov, I can explain. It wasn't me! I'm a good communist... Take her to the truck. Well done, Comrade. This proves the German is innocent. Yes, possibly. Though I'm sure he's guilty of something else, no? Apparently, the man we're searching for... ...went to Berlin University in the Engineering Department. What are you suggesting I do? Comrade... ...we've seen you informing on Soviets. Why don't you try your hand at Germans? Comrade, perhaps the Chief of Leningrad's NKVD... ...could spare the time to attend... ...our musical celebration at the weekend? Your attendance would be very, er... ...helpful. Yakov's such a dreamer. He's certain to invite the Germans. An opportunity we should not miss. Make sure we have some of our best people there. Fuck. Bastard fuck. Fuck bastard. Tamara... No! Everybody outside! Now, move! Take off your clothes! I said... ...take off your clothes! They're going to kill us. Where's the doctor? And Captain Alexandrova? Everything! This way! Inside! They're going to gas us. Right, find something that fits. You're going to the dance tonight. Not only the musicians but all of you! Please. Please. Whoa! Where are the clothes from? Why? Does it bother you? That's it. Trousers. Naughty. It's yours. There's a pair of brown trousers here. Trousers, anyone? Don't think of them as your enemy. They're here to be entertained. They want you to play well. So, play well! They'll kill us before we play a single note. The way you play, Ernst - that will be a blessing! It's time, gentlemen. Let's go. Now! Immediately, right now. Let's go, now. Let's go! Ivan? Ivan? Ivan? Don't you dare stop! Ivan! Ivan, there you are! I've been looking all over looking all over for you! Have the Germans arrived? Yes. Shall I bring them in? No. Don't worry, I'll do it. Relax! What can go wrong? Everything can go wrong, Ivan! In you come, in you come. Quick as you can! Come on. Come on, come on. Take your positions! Positions! Quick, quick, play. Play, play, play. May I have the pleasure? I think I know the man you're looking for. Yes. This is our last dance! So, everyone, please join in! You're a wonderful dancer, doctor. Oh, such good manners. Tell me, do Germans learn this at University... ...or is this a typical Aryan trait? I didn't go to University. Not now, Anton. Let's not spoil the party. Andrei? Andrei? Andrei, no! Put it away. Put it away. Okay. Open the door. Come on. Goodnight. Natalia... ...he's younger than me. Lucky you. - He says... - Bye. See you again. What? He says I'm the first girl he ever cared for. And do you believe him? I don't know. But I do know that I don't want to be alone. Goodbye. Then follow your heart. See you later. What shall we do? What about Olga? Oh, fuck Olga! And fuck Pavlov, too! Andrei, open the gate. Go on, Andrei, open it! And make sure you have them back here by dawn. Lucky bastards! Max. Oh, no. What? What? Here's your suicide note. You have been upsetting me, Max. You lost your faith. You sympathised with the enemy. But I'm making sure you're not dishonoured. Your family will be proud of you. Germany, too. Close your eyes again, Max. You're already dead. No! Jesus Christ it's cold. Did you know him? Yes. From University? He was my student. Do you know what he did during the war? No. When the war started I lost touch of him. Of course. He was notorious. Even by SS standards. Well, Comrade, you are a true Soviet. I was worried you might be lost in your mission. Mission? What are you doing? Andrei is being relieved of his duties. I thought we had a deal? We did have a deal. Now it's over. Take me instead. This is better. Natalia. Pavlov's been on the phone. Stalin's made yet another new agreement with the Allies. We're sending all the Germans back home. What? Trucks will be arriving at We only have a few hours. Come on! How many are missing? About a dozen. Don't worry, we'll find them. When they hear they're going home, they'll come running. Get dressed. You're going back home! No. No, it's not possible. It's more than possible! Get back to the camp now! All aboard!
