And... crap. Kings bet. Five. God, what the fuck are you doing in this hand? What? For the last three hours, you've been playing cards like a moron. Yeah, I know. Hey, uh... what does "cotillion" mean? I don't know. A flower? Yeah? I don't know. Dance, it's a dance class. Can we have the next card, please? Take it easy, Randolph. Twenty. Call. Twenty. Up 20. Up 20 again. Up 60. Fine. Full house. Kings full. Four fours. Oh, for fuck's sake! You should never go up against her. She's already got your new truck. No, she does not have my truck. Well, she's driving it. All right, cash me. She rivered the four, for fuck's sake! Yeah. Well, that is fucking ridiculous. I know, I'm not proud of it, but there it is. I gotta go. Oh, great, now she scats. No, I said I was going an hour ago. Okay, thanks for the game, and thanks for the vocab help. Play a few more hands and I'll go with you. I can't; I got to go to the city. Right. Drive safe. Yep. Take care of my truck. It's not your truck. Hi, Sal. Hey! Still open? Not really, but I'll get you a beer. Thanks. Thanks. How are things? Tired. You going to the city? Yeah, got a little ahead of myself. You keep watching us. Yeah. You want to play? What do you usually play for? Five bucks a rack. You know what? I got to be in the city soon, so, uh, how about 20 a rack? And I'll give a lot of weight. Dad, I got to go to school early today. What time is it? Morning, Gulls. Morning. It's like 7:00, but remember, I told you we have to do a project in English class? Yeah. So, I gotta go. Okay. Oh! Crap, Mom. Hi, Gulls. Get off the sidewalk, will ya? Yeah, in a couple years, when you're taller. But not yet. What's this? I just busted my hand. How'd you do that? Just fell. You didn't write me about it. It's not a big deal. What, don't kids sign casts anymore? Not really. And this is what you have to wear? Yeah, sixth grade. Coming down the street, I thought maybe you'd become a lawyer or something. So, how's sixth grade? You know, now I'm the youngest in middle school, instead of the oldest in lower, so... you know, it's cool. You mean, you're picked on a bit? Yeah, sometimes. Is that how you got your hand busted? Nuh-uh. I just fell. Okay, well, uh... don't pick back too much, okay? I got a letter for you. Oh, that's great, Gulls. You know that I had to look up "Cotillion" from your last one. Yeah? That's horrible. So, what else... what else is middle school like? Well, it's kind of the same. It's boring. I have to read Johnny Tremain. What's that about? This kid who makes silver bowls with Paul Revere and gets his hand burned. You like it? It's okay. Not really. I can't finish it. Yeah, and anyway, silversmithing will probably get in the way of your lawyering. Yeah. How's your dad and Ellen? Fine. Yeah, you like her any better now? She's okay. She's a pretty good cook, but she gets angry about the weirdest things. Like what? Like sometimes, after I wash my hands, she says I leave the soap dirty. What does that mean? I know. It means I'm supposed to wash the soap after I wash my hands. Well... But sometimes when she talks to her friends, she says things. Like what? Like once I heard her say-- about you, I guess-- that they wanted you to get a... annulment? That who wanted? I guess Dad and Grandma. Oh. And I asked Eric Muftie what that was, and he said it was something dirty. A sex thing. Who's Eric Muftie? A kid in my class. Well, Eric is wrong. Good. It's-It's not a... it's not a sex thing at all. Good. It's sort of like a... Sort of the same thing as a divorce. Oh. You already got one. You don't really need to worry about it, okay? Okay. I promise you, Eric is wrong. Good. It's not a dirty thing at all. Okay. Here's your letter. Thanks, Gulls. Got to get going. Why can't you just write to me at home? Why? You don't like Mr. Quinette? He's nice, but sometimes he isn't there. So I think maybe I missed one. No, if there's a letter, he'll be there. Okay. I think it's a pretty cool system, don't you? I guess. A secret system. Yeah. Gulls, you got to keep it a secret, okay? I know. And after you read one of my letters, make sure to just throw them away, okay? I do. Good. Okay, tell me more. Are you on a team? - Yeah. Soccer, but B team. What position? - Left wing. Left wing. Really? That's pretty hard, right? You got to be kicking with your left foot a lot. Yeah. - How are you? Okay. I mean, it's B team, so it's mostly 'tards. Well, better to be a big fish in a small pond. Even if all the other fish are 'tard fish? Yeah. Even then. I, uh... I should stop here. When are you coming back? Well, it'll be sooner than last time. Probably a couple of weeks. Two weeks? Probably three. - No, four. No, definitely not four. But send me letters, okay? Okay. Okay. Keep your nose clean, kid. Okay. Okay. I love you, Gulls. Me, too. Mm. Okay. Now, go on. I'll see you soon, okay? Couple of weeks? Yeah, a couple. And try reading that Johnny, uh, what's-his-face book one more time, okay? I can't, Mom. I swear, it's horrible. Forget it. Forget it. Go on, don't be late. Okay. Kailey, Jesus. Look at you. I know, I know, I know. I've been up for a few days. I'm not so sure it's the long hours hurting you. Yeah. Well, I see Gulley every day. He looks good. I saw him this morning. His arm's broken. I saw that. It's okay. Yeah. He's doing great. He's a good kid. Is there a game around? You see anything? Even if there were, I mean... you're a mess. You got enough for hotel room? Yeah, but, uh, I'd rather use it to get a game. Want to sleep here a bit? You mind? Go ahead. Thanks. Come get me if there's something I should be awake for, okay? Got you. How was that English project? The what? That thing you had to be in early for. Oh. It was good. Yeah? What book was it on? Gulley? It wasn't a book. It was... We had to make an advertisement. Oh. For what? Well, everybody got different things. What did you get? Hot chocolate. - Huh. In English class? Why would they do that? I don't know. They didn't give you a reason? No, they did. Well, what was it? Gulls, your dad's talking to you. Don't call me Gulls. Hey. Lose the tone, young man. Now, what was the reason? My teacher says that poets sometimes make advertisements for money. So, instead of writing a poem, we could do an ad. Hmm. Swear to God, if it was up to me, you'd be in public school so fast. So, how'd you do? We won. - You did? With hot chocolate? - Yeah. Well, what was your ad? We made a picture of some mountains with a cottage and smoke coming out of the chimney, and we called it Jungfrau Hot Chocolate. Jungfrau. What's that? It's a mountain in Switzerland. No, it isn't. Yes, it is. Jungfrau? Yeah. It's nice you won. It's not pronounced that way. But it's real? But it's pronounced Yung Frow. But it exists. Not pronounced that way, it doesn't. Hey. Hi. Do me a favor, okay? Sure. Maybe don't lecture me on mountains in Switzerland. I-I didn't think... You might think you know everything under the sun, but trust me, you don't. I know. Just don't lecture me. Think you can handle that? Okay. Terrific. Well, good morning. Hey. How'd you sleep? - Terrific. Place looks a little better. Oh, yeah. It's great for a week night. There a game here? Yeah, maybe. That kid in the stupid track suit-- he'll play you. But he only plays ten dollar racks. That won't even be gas money. Who are the guys playing one pocket? The older guy is Duncan. The other fella-- I don't know his name. He's gonna quit soon. I ain't never seen him won a game yet. Okay. I'll try for Duncan. That's gonna be a hard game to get. He's good. He'll also try to negotiate weight. Should I give him any? No! He's good. All right, I'll be back in an hour. Keep him here if he wants a game. Hey, is Markus there? You got a number for him? Okay, well, uh, maybe if you run into him. I know, but maybe if you just happen to see him, can you tell him that Kailey's in the city, and to keep an eye out? Kailey. K-A-I-L-E-Y. He'll know. For Gulls tomorrow. You Duncan? I am, yeah. Kailey. It's nice to meet you. Want to play some one pocket? Maybe. For what? I don't know. Okay. Give me two balls. No. Can't. Quinn says I can't give any weight. He does, huh? He does, and he's a fair guy. Is he staking you? No. Okay. Maybe. But he's wrong. I don't know. Seemed to play okay earlier tonight. I was playing against Mike Simms. Play him every week. Beat him every week. He's a degenerate. He loves to lose. It's no reflection. How about no weight, but a guaranteed renegotiation after five games? Okay, but we play for a hundred a rack. Okay. Lack for break. No, I'll give you the break. I'll take the right pocket. Seven ball. Nice games. Maybe you should be giving me a ball. Nope. - But out, Quinn. I'll give her a ball. Nope, she's gonna quit. What the fuck Quinn?! You pull me off a game just when the dipshit's about to give me a ball?! Jesus fucking shit! He ain't a dipshit. He still would've took ya. Fuck you. Oh, fuck yourself. You're playing like shit, Kai. I know it. You know it. You're wrong. - No. I easily had the last game. You barely got the last game. I don't know what's on your mind, but, you know, you're not playing half-way decent. Where are you going? To find a fucking game. Well, go get it. Kai! Kai! I thought you hated this city. More and more every fucking day. How are you Markus? I'm all right. Uh, I'm not really a running kind of guy, so... Thank you. Oh, what are you doing in town? Trying to get out. Oh, that should be easy enough. - No. Really out. Oh. I'm thinking Canada out. Oh. You could do that, right? I could, yeah. How much would that be? $10,000, thereabout... There'll be two of us. Twenty. He's a kid. Oh, that's... that's different, Kai. Yeah, I figured. No, I mean, that's really different. I can get you a passport, get you into Canada, no problem, but... traveling with a kid? That is way different. They look hard-- single adults traveling with kids. Passport'd have to be fucking bomb-proof. Can you still do it? Maybe, uh... the price goes up. How much up? Fifty, at least. How long? Couple of weeks. Let's do it. Where are you going? To raise your fucking money. What about Mexico? I don't speak Spanish, Markus. Mexico's nice. Hey, uh... Jameson neat, water back. Thanks. Four Buds. Are those guys your boyfriends? What? Why don't you invite me on your team? What? Invite me on your team. Why? Because it might be fun to beat them. Take my place. Really? Yeah. Fucking hate this game. That guy your boyfriend? Depends on who you ask. I suppose I'll ask you. Nope. Okay, then. She's playing for Kat. What? She's on my team. Okay. No, no, who the fuck is this? Come on, let's play. It'd be fun. Lady, this isn't, uh... like, you know, an open thing. Come on. It'll be fun. Seriously. Fuck off. No, Brad. Let her play. Okay. Here's, uh... hundred dollars. I'm gonna play you or the both of you. I'm gonna play with-- sorry, what's your name again? Charlotte. Charlotte here... and we'll beat you. Okay. But, uh, both of us play you. Sure. Do you have a hundred dollars? Bitch. Nice talk. Go ahead and break. Fuck! Do you want to go? You can. Nah, go for it. Uh, take the three. Which one? Just hit it right there, and it'll roll down the side. Sorry. Don't fucking choke. Just sink a fucking ball. Oh! Fuck you! Fuck! Don't worry. Just aim for my finger. Okay. Just aim for my finger. You're a fucking bitch. Take it easy, man. Get the fuck out of here. You owe me a hundred dollars. You missed that shot on purpose. Probably. You still owe me a hundred dollars. Who the fuck do you think you are? You fucking bitch! Is she here? No, why? Because it was not mailed. Well, she gave me that before she left. Oh. Hang around if you'd like, kiddo. Okay. What time is it? About 6:00. When? Wednesday afternoon. What are you looking at? I'm just checking you out. I heard you're not supposed to let someone hit in the head sleep for very long, but every time I try to wake you up, you take a swing at me. So I thought I'd just... sit here and watch you. To see if I'd just stop breathing? Don't need any stitches, but I'd leave the bandage on. So what was that about last night? I just wanted a game. You win? - Yup. How much? You didn't win shit. Give me a break. What's that? About two thou. Enough for you to get out of here and... catch a little rest. You're a mess. I know I'm a mess. I got coldcocked by some dipshit frat boy. I can't hustle a game to save my life, I got blood all over my clothes, and I seem to be throwing up a lot. I know I'm a mess, Quinn. What's that throwing up about? Nervous, I guess. What are you nervous about? I'm going to get him back. Kai, you don't even have visitation rights let alone custody. I know. It would be kidnapping. I know. Eventually, they'll come looking for you. Not eventually. I'll be the first person they come looking for. I'm his mother. And I have a record. You do? Yep. - What for? Running a card room. They put you in jail for that? Fuck! Small town. And one bitch came in and made a huge racket. Who? Gulley's grandmother, Abigail. I worked in a town bar, and I, uh... had a card game in back. One side of town was a little college with a bunch of rich kids who couldn't play for shit, but they could drink. And the other side was a... seminary with a few young men who could do both, usually pretty well. Gulley's dad was from the seminary side. You were dating a priest? He got kicked out. I got pregnant, and he proposed and... For a couple weeks it was fantastic. I had this... funny, handsome and I was going to be a mother. Then a shitstorm named Abigail rolled in. Next thing I know, David disappears, I get brought up on a whole load of charges, and I'm now three months pregnant. And Abby made me a deal. Give up the baby, get a divorce, she'd do whatever she could to make things easier. I couldn't say no. I mean, I was 25 years old. I was going to lose the kid either way. So while I appreciate the cash, it isn't going to be enough. You can't tell me anymore about this. I know. I own the pool hall, the rent here is cheap. I'm just too old to start fucking things up now. Can you help me set up some games? How much you need? I-I don't know yet. I, uh... thinking around $60,000. Jesus! You going to offer me a drink, or what? You can't raise that by just grabbing games. Okay. Did you think you could? I hadn't really thought that far. Ah, crap. What about that guy I you off? Duncan. Yeah. Maybe him. Okay. - Yeah. Maybe. Listen, I don't want to know anymore about it. Okay. Gulley, come set the table. Okay. Use the nice napkins. Your grandma's coming over. I know. I'm coming. Abby hasn't seen you for awhile so maybe put on a nice shirt. Okay. Remember how I had to work last weekend? I don't know. Well, I did and we couldn't get to mass. Yeah. Well, Abby may ask, and let's just... avoid it, okay? Sure. Okay. Go help Ellen. Okay. Ellen, this is good. What is this? It's called escarole. How's the world of real estate? Busy. People always want to buy new apartments. I wouldn't want people coming and going through my house. It feels like snooping. I don't go through their drawers. You look in their closets, I bet. That's not snooping, Mom. I'm just doing my job. And school for you, Gulley? It's good. Good. He won an English thing the other day, didn't you, Gulls? Yeah. Well, I like that school. It's good, yeah. How are your catechism classes? They're fine. You work hard there, too. Remember what your grandfather used to say? "You got to take the bitter with the lousy." Jesus! What a thing to remember. No. "Eternity is a hell of a long time." Right. Seriously, Gulley, apply yourself. I do. He could work harder. How was, uh, late mass last week? It was fine. Who did the early? Cavanaugh. Really? We got Smoltz. Were there guitars? No. God, I hate those guitars. And then they start singing the Lord's Prayer. I mean, what in hell do these people think they're doing? I don't know. Gulley, remember, just because a thing is new it doesn't make it good. Okay. It makes my skin crawl to hear that stupid, damn singing. I know. So let's all go together to Cavanaugh on Sunday. Okay. When the three of you go on your own, Gulley, do you go by yourself to get Communion? Of course. I'm asking Gulley. Sure. It's not that hard. But it's important. I know. She's just never going to let it go. Snooping? Jesus. She has, it's just her way. Well, it ridiculous. You left the seminary Give it a fucking rest. It's not that, Ellen. If there's one thing that woman adores, it's Gulley, and he wouldn't even exist if you... That's not what it is. Then what, the divorce? Yes. It's not a big deal. It is to her and to everybody in there. It's a big deal. Every time she takes Gulley for Communion, and I just stay there in the pew... it is a big deal, Ellen. I'm standing there with you. No, it's different. And don't say he's the only thing she adores. Really, who's next on the list, her housecleaner? Who are you writing letters to? What? I saw a letter on your desk before. Who are you writing letters to? It's not a letter. Don't lie to me. So who the hell are you writing our business to? "Grandma's coming for dinner tonight." Uh, "I'm trying to keep the soap clean." I mean, what the hell is that? I said it's not a letter. Gulley... - It's not. Then what is it? A diary. A diary? Yeah. Jesus. What are you, a nine-year-old girl? Hello, Gulley. How's school? It's good. Here you go. - Great. Thanks. Well, holy shit, where have you been? I got stuck in the city for a bit. How was it? It was good. How have things been here? Same ol'. Game tonight? Sure. Probably go easier on Randolph though. He still pissed? Just doesn't like getting rivered is all. No one does. You want a beer? Uh, yeah. Yeah, and maybe a whiskey. You sure you want to be double-fisting? You've looked better, you know. Yeah, I hear that. Hi, Abby. It's Ellen. Um, you probably aren't back from mass yet, but we couldn't make it. Um, Gulley had a fever this morning, so I just put him back in bed. But, uh, we'll try and swing by later this afternoon. Okay? See you soon. Are you feeling better? I am, yeah. What was it you think? Just a kid thing. So, not the escarole. No, I don't think so. Well, you missed Father Cavanaugh. He was good, but it was Sunday so he was playing to the Sunday only. Lots of Galilee and "fisher of men." Do you know why Christ is a fisher of men, Gulley? 'Cause he likes catching people. Are you being wise? No. I might be wrong about that school. David! You have a nosebleed. He's been getting these sometimes. Here, hon. Thanks. Have you been to a doctor for God's sake? It's just a bloody nose, Mom. I'm fine. That was even less than a week. - I know. That's better right? Come on. Got to get our picture take. Why? - 'Cause the only one I have of you you're like two day old or something. Okay. Oh, uh, I wrote down what I do everyday. It's pretty boring. Thanks, Gulls. - Sure. See your grandma yesterday? Yeah. How was that? Okay. It gave me a headache. - Yeah? Yeah and dad got a bloody nose. How? - I don't know, it just happened. You sure your grandma didn't punch him? Do I look like that? Still look like a lawyer. Hey, how's the Paul Revere guy? It's done. - You finished it? No, but we had the test already. How'd it go? - I don't know yet. I got Eric Mufti to tell me how it ended, so that helped. Well, I can tell this Mufti guy ain't much of a genius. Yeah, but he's okay. Yeah? - Yeah. I have to ask you a question. Okay. It's not really a fair question. What do you mean? Uh, I think you're too young to ask it to. That's okay. How would you like to come live with me for a bit? Uh, it'd be very different, you know. Lots a, a lot of changes. Yeah. - I mean different school, different city, all of that. - I know. What about missing Eric? I wouldn't miss him that much. What about missing your dad? Dad found the letter. Oh. But he didn't know it was to you. Oh, well, that's okay then. Yeah, but still, he was mad about it and this is going to make him really, really mad. Yeah. No, I know it will. And it will make Abby mad, too, but you know what? You won't be around to see it so you don't have to worry about it, okay? Okay. Okay-Okay you want to do it? Uh-huh. You gotta make sure you see Mr. Quinette every single day, okay. 'Cause we can't see each other. Yeah. And listen... if we do this, where we're going, there might not be any cotillions or any of that fancy stuff. Is that going to be okay? Yeah. - Okay. Try and keep your nose clean, okay. How was the trip? - Good. Coffee? - Yeah, please. Got any money left? I made a couple hundred in a card game. Okay! Come on, I got somebody I want you to meet. This is Ralph. Uh... hey, Ralph. I want you to play him. Okay, uh, what do you want to play, Ralph? One pocket. $100 a rack. How you doing? Good. I'm up. How much? $600. Out of how many racks? I got to say the kid's good, but I'm shooting the lights out of him. It was nice meeting you, ma'am. You're a good shot. What the fuck was that? That was an audition. For him or me? For him. Remember Billy Victor? California guy. That's his kid, Ralphie. I gave him a grand. Out of the two that I offered you. I told him, "You lose $600 exactly. "Don't tip your hand "and get your best game, you can keep the $400." That kid was laying down? Bullshit! There's no way that kid could beat me. Oh, I don't know whether he can or he can't, but I do know that he can lose to you. And that's better for us. Why? -'Cause you're not going to get this game for 60 K all by yourself. You need a stalking horse and I believe we got him. Jesus Christ, Quinn, could you at least give me a head's up when you're doing shit like this? Why? If he can take a fall to you, he can convince anybody. So give me my $600 back. Oh, listen to me, there's no way he could take you straight up. Controlled losing is not winning. Hey, see that guy over there. Is that guy lurking around for you? Yeah. He's clearly not here for the pool. He's just drawing attention to himself. Would you get him the hell out of here? Yeah. This is a ridiculous game. 'Cause you suck at it. - Yeah, I do, I know. But I mean, it doesn't even have the appeal to try to get better for it. I mean, it's just, it's irritating. That's 'cause you suck at it. Come on. Don't get too excited. It's just the photos. Okay. I'll have the money soon. I'm not worried, uh, you know. They'll be ready in a couple of days. Come here. What? - Look, I need you to do something, besides get me my money. I want you to figure out where you're going to cross. What do you mean? Well, these are going to be good. They're going to be as good as anything you've ever seen. But, since you've got a kid, you try to go through a major airport, like, uh, Toronto or Vancouver, you're just asking for trouble. - We're driving. Yeah, but still, um... like Niagara Falls, still stupid. Okay. - Okay. Uh, you taking your own car? No, no, I won it in a card game. But the guy keeps holding the paper thinking he can get it back. That's a dumb guy. Hey, uh... Markus... What? What? - I need one more thing. A gun. Look, that's not the kind of thing you say in just like a talky voice. Doesn't have to work. In fact, I don't even need bullets. But it should look good. - No. There's reason in the world you need a pretend gun. You either need a real one or you don't. No, I need a real looking pretend one. Hey, Quinn! Quinn, get up! I got breakfast. Quinn! ...I don't eat breakfast! Go away! Oh, for God's sakes. You have to... oh. Kailey, don't! Oh... - Sorry. Uh... sorry again. You're making my retirement difficult in many, many ways. It just... What? I don't know, it just... sorry. Why the early morning enthusiasm? Here. What's this? Just some things to remember when people come asking. People? Police people? Probably. Okay. "She slept on top of the table for a few days, "and then was gone. She played lots of pool." You could have slipped this under the door. I already said I'm sorry. Okay. I need to set up the game soon. Well, all we can do is try. Duncan plays this... this guy Mike Simms every week, and he beats him every week, without fail. First step, we got to get rid of this degenerate Simms, and get Duncan to play Ralphie Victor, and if Ralphie does his job the way we know he can, Duncan should have a good taste in his mouth when you come around. Okay. I'll get Markus to distract Simms for us. Yeah, but you got to keep your eye on me, because... if you don't play him just right, he'll slip the hook. Okay. There's more on the back. The letter. On-On the back. "Don't lie for me. At all." You got it. It's not a sex thing. - Yes, it is. It's not. I asked. It is. Your mother wanted an abortion. It's not that. It's like an annuls. It's the same thing. It's not. It's like a divorce, but for the church. A divorce from God? I guess. - That's even worse then. Shut up, and she didn't even get it. But she wanted to. - Shut up! Nice games. No more? No. You want to play again? Come on. I'll give you the ball I offered you before. No. I'll give you two balls. What were we playing before? A hundred a rack. Okay. Why don't we do five a rack, and I'll still take the weight. Okay. But I'm not going to give you the first break. So we'll lag. Nice. We got to play straight up. No more giving you weight. Okay. Let's go a thousand a rack. Sure. This can't be a cash game anymore. Hey, go down and lock the door. I thought you might like this. What is it? It's a book of poems by Sherwood Anderson. He was a poet, but he worked in advertising first. Oh. I just... I thought you might like it. That it? How much am I down? How much am I down? That's a lot. You should quit. I'll play you for $10,000 a rack, but I need a break first. I'll be back in an hour or so. You be here? I'll be here. It's back to being a cash game from now on. Okay. Okay. Here. Give him one of these. No, no. Come on, eat it. You'll need it. And try to get a rest, will you? Just stretch out right here. What about you? Well, I'm fine. I chewed most the enamel off my teeth, but I'm fine. What have you got there? Okay. Plus, that's seven, five he owes. This is, uh... ...25, 600 something. Shit. Lose two in a row, we're through. What if he doesn't come back? Oh, he's coming back. How do you know? - Because he wants to beat your brains in, that's why. It's almost 5:00 in the morning. Now, listen, you don't need to win six games. Win four. I'll make the rest up in bets. And don't be surprised if he don't try to fuck with you. Like how? - I don't know, but he'll do something to try to knock you off your rhythm. Ten grand a rack. Yup. Cash. Quinn's got mine. And Quinn's friend has mine. Your dad would be sick. And we're playing nine ball. Raise to seven. What happened to one pocket? It went away. Problem? No problem. What? Just seems a chumpy game for us. You want to quit me? No, I'll play you. Just think it's beneath us is all. Well... I'll learn to live with it. Lag for the break. Nobody's going to bet on this. This is his game. You'll be lucky to sink even one nine ball. Fuck off, will you? I need a minute. No way. I need a minute. - No! Then it's a forfeit. The hell you say! You took a three-hour break earlier! That wasn't in the middle of a fucking game. She can take a break at the end. She wants a break now, it's a forfeit. All right. You guys, move. You okay? Yeah. You sure? - Yeah. Okay. And this isn't the middle of the fucking game. Who did that? It's okay. Your dad do that? No, just a kid at school. That Muftie kid? Yeah. I told you that kid was bad news. Yeah, but you were great. Yeah? Well... it worked out. All right, get out of here. Okay? Hey, uh, Gulls. Uh, tomorrow, when you leave for school, uh, pack some extra clothes in your backpack, okay? And find some excuse to get what's-her-face to walk you and leave the apartment door unlocked. Okay. Oh, and meet me here. That should do you and give you a little something extra. You reimburse yourself a thousand? It was $400. You're going to need all you can get. You should take it. Nah. Hey. What are you doing? I just want the broth. Okay. It's all in here. Thanks. There you go. All right, look. I took you at your word. It's a fake gun, but it looks real, and if you put bullets in it, it's going to blow up in your face. Thanks. And do me a favor, will you? What's that? When you get there, just, uh, you know, send me a postcard of a pool table or something just to tell me that you made it safe. Thanks, Markus. Okay. Take care. It's locked, it's locked. David. David? David. David. Kai? What are you doing here? I was in town, thought I'd say hi. How'd you get in? Door was open. You have to buzz. Just followed somebody in. Where's Gulley? He's at school. Jesus. What are you doing here, Rings? Don't call me that. Sorry. So what are you doing here? Told you, I was just in town. Here, brought you a coffee. You what? A coffee. Look at you. All grown up. You want to know what I've been up to? What, like, the last, I don't know, 11 years have been like? No. Yeah, you do. How's Abby? Well, give her my best. He's been writing to you, hasn't he? Those letters were, were to you? That lying brat. David, do me a favor. C-Can we just, just sit here for a sec? Please. He wrote me about a lot of stuff. Yeah? Like what? Well... for one, you're making him take dancing lessons, for God's sakes. Give me a break. And how he has to lie about going to church and how he gets into fights. Every kid gets into fights. Yeah. Not every kid has to lie for his dad. How'd he break his hand? He fell down. - How? Kids fall down-- enough with the fucking grilling. Seriously, David, I need you to stay in bed. Shut up, Rings, okay? Where the fuck is my watch? David. I need you to stay in bed and don't call me Rings even one more goddamn time! Lay back down. Lay back down. What are you doing? I'm taking him with me. Well, he's not here. I know. Oh, Jesus. Now, tell me, how did he fall down? We just bumped into each other. Like I said... he wrote me about a lot of stuff. What do you think you're doing, Kailey? How Abby is the same. You know the one thing I'm gonna miss is not being able to tell her what a true and hateful bitch... Ow! Fuck you. - Like I said, he wrote me about a lot of stuff. But the thing in his letters that's the clearest is what he never says. Yeah, what's that? He's scared of you. 'Cause you're angry all the time and he doesn't know why. And so you're taking him? Right. So why are you telling me? You could have just taken him without all this. 'Cause I want you to know he's going to be okay. You're pointing a gun at me. Doesn't inspire confidence. He's going to be fine. He's going to be better. He might actually have a couple of fucking friends. You can get up now. Hey, Rings? You don't want to be doing this, Rings! It's why you're sick. You know it's wrong. Ow! God! I told you to stop calling me that. Find yourself a little nickname for Ellen. I don't have one. I know. I don't know when she'll be back. Hopefully, she'll have a nice, long breakfast somewhere and linger a bit, but until then... just think about how I'm right. He can't be here anymore. Something bad will happen. Abby will push harder, you'll drink more, something else will get broken. Just... just give me a chance. Okay? I'll take care of him. Rings, you don't want to do this. Rings. If you feel like you have to call the police, just wait as long as you can. You drive a truck? That's great. Come on, Gulls. We've got to go. But why do this to you? She wanted me to know that he'd be okay. What? She said... he'd be better off with her than with us. Is she right? David? Is she right? Call the police. Is there anything I can do to help? Nope. Stay strapped in. Okay. I could help you drive. You know how to drive standard? Yeah. No, you don't. Did you pack any other clothes? Some, yeah, but they're in the back. Okay, well, uh, stay buckled in, but lose the lawyer outfit, will you? Sure. No, you're not listening-- she doesn't have visitation rights. Nobody's seen that woman in 11 years. Not even your grandson? Absolutely not him. She hasn't seen him since he was born. Where was that? Ohio, near Columbus. Where was that town? David? They may have been writing each other. Oh, for Christ sake, David! I only just found out. How? What do you mean? You said you don't know where she was, so how's your son going to write her? I-I don't know. Okay. Anything else? She has a gun. You keep telling us that. At least let me shift. No. I'll roshambo you for it. You'll what? Rock, paper, scissors? Oh, for God sakes. All right, fine. I'm going to throw a rock. Really? Promise. Okay. On four, all right? Okay, one, two, three. I lied. Oh! - Now teach me. Okay, up and towards me is first. Down is second. Up and towards you is third. Down is fourth. Okay, that's pretty much it. But you gotta do it when I push in the clutch, otherwise it's going to make a terrible noise and we crash. Okay? Okay. First. Second. Third. That's fourth. I can't believe you cheated. No letters. All of it's schoolwork. I looked through those already. Where the hell is Chasm Falls, New York? We'll find out. But Quinn's Billiards should be pretty easy. Goddamn it. You know some woman named Kailey Sullivan? Oh, fuck. Did she wreck my truck? Why would she wreck your truck? Because she thinks it's hers. Excuse me. You Mr. Quinette? Hey, Gulls. You try to get some sleep, okay? We've still got a ways. No, I'm okay. What do you think Dad's doing right now? I think he's worried about you. I just hope he isn't mean to Ellen. You want to write him a letter? No. Maybe some time but not right now. Why not? It would just make him even madder. Well, we'll write him a letter whenever you want, okay? Go to sleep, Gulls. How far is Canada? It's not far. Probably about 20 miles up there. We've got to catch a bus. Let's just drive. We can't. Hey, Gulls, listen. On the bus, if anyone asks, you're a very sick kid. Like a cold? No, maybe even worse than that. Escarole poisoning? What is that? I guess like food poisoning. No. Uh, worse than that. I've got to get my bag first. What time is it? Almost 5:30. And remember, worse than escarole poisoning, okay? Morning. Morning. You're new. Yeah. Mom, I'm starving. The bus will be here soon. No, it'll be late. It always is. Uh, I'll go get us some donuts, okay? Stay here. Can I get, uh, four plain cake donuts, a milk and a large coffee? I don't have any regular coffee. I just have decaf. You gotta be fucking kidding me. I drank it all. Fine. Just, uh, give me a decaf. Mom? Gull, I told you to stay in line. Kailey? Kailey? I need you to stop running now. Kailey? Look at me. Look at me. Kailey! No, no, no, leave the bag! Leave the gun! Kailey! No! Mom! Okay. Get in the truck. No, it's okay. Okay. It's okay. I'm fine, Gulls. I just... I just need you to shift again, okay? Just... I'll get you into first, but from then on, it's all you, kid. Okay? Okay, come on. That's my boy. Hey. You Gulley? Yeah, I am. I got a letter for you.
