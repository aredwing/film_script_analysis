Take STF I'm too old for the job It'll look good on your resume No thanks You haven't changed a bit I need an experienced man like you on this case You mean it? You think I'm joking? You think Dr. Q is just a sick serial killer? It's your job to find that out He was with the 'Ilsim Ring'? What's that? Back in 1992... this guy raped and killed two sisters but he walked, diagnosed to be schizophrenic His name was... Right, Kyungtae Ahn! He got killed on his way out of court. The perpetrator said... "I brought him to justice." How do you know that? This organization called 'Ilsim', was behind him. Nothing was confirmed It was just the name that came up You were on the case, right? Ilsim' was... Nobody knows anything about it but the name Hey, guys Is that true you have a witness? Capt. Hyungsuk Cho There's no obvious connection between Cho and the other victims However, I strongly believe this man is Dr. Q We're running matches on this picture. In 85, we picked up some guys for serial rapes and murders At first, we were looking for a serial killer It turned out that each of them was to blame for each case Don't leave out anything when nothing's definite He was seen at the crime scene The witness was drunk He was very conscious Anything on Capt. Cho? It's a fast-changing world, but crimes stay the same Without knowing the motive we can't nail him FBI says no motive is the characteristic of modern crimes We're not in America Keep all the possibilities open First time here? Right You're a cop, aren't you? What makes you think that? I can smell cops - Many cop customers? - Hold on You're leaving? Already? See you later Exec. Changmoon Song of Taeyang Securities? You know him? Who doesn't? He's got the hands of Midas You have rooms upstairs? Some people like it quiet Shit! Detective Pyo? What are you doing here? You've been laundering money for Changmoon Song, right? What are you talking about? Don't look at me like that What did Capt. Cho do for Mr. Song? They were like brothers Song used his accounts to launder money And? That's all I know If they find out I talked I'm dead meat. General Manager of Taeyang... Sijong Park? He did some dirty work for Mr. Song He's an ex-cop He was Cho's partner. Was he? Is this about Dr. Q? Thanks. I owe you one. It's me. Trace the bank accounts of Capt. Cho and Taemoon Song of Taeyang Securities I'm on it A moron walks in here, and the monitor pops! We need to talk It won't take long What are you looking at? I didn't mean to... It just caught my eyes. You knew I was alone, didn't you? No way! - Gosh! - Give it here. - Keys to my car - Oh, sure Don't ever come back about your bike! What a bitch! Show me her tits and call it even? What kind of cop! She's quite cute, though Yes? I'm on my way! They killed my husband Song cheated him out of money with false information and made him borrow more from Maguri. When he couldn't pay it back they took everything. Even our house! We'll get to the bottom of this. What are you, deaf? I've already told you! I know my rights! You know the law that well and beat up people? Says who? You've got no victims! You want victims?! Yuseok Kim! Ring a bell? Get back here! You call yourself a human?! Let's talk, man! Beat it, punk! Mom! Get back here! Stop him! He's going to kill me! You're dead meat!

I don't know any Song Sijong Park gave orders. Sijong Park? Sorry Mr. Sijong Park? He no longer works here What's the matter? What did he do here? He was a general manager You know Maguri? Maguri? Is that an animal? His name is Cheolku Ma Never heard of him Get me the report on the day-trading. And send Mr. Kim in It's me Cops were here, looking for Sijong They're from Homicide My hands are tied I need your help The cell phone? Our conversation was recorded in it I'm really sorry I'll handle it Chicken for me? You skipped dinner You charged it again, didn't you? Thanks anyway - He's still alone? - Right You could've offered me a piece I was starving, man Why did I buy these? Scratches! You're the man! Sucheol? Hello? Hey! Isn't he Sijong's son? Yeah, that's him - Get out and follow him - Okay Wait! Mr. Cocky! STF is after him, too? It's the 1st floor. - You think he's home? - Beats me. Mr. Cocky is sticking around Let me go check it out Just the kid and grandma - Are we on stake out? - I guess He's gone I'll ask the boss what this is about I doubt he's going to show up Let's hit the road All right Cool! - He's good, man - Incredible! Hey, bro! You... Working hard, huh? Salute! Fuck me! What are you doing here? They came 3 hours ago He fixed all the broken computers Hard to see you, bro. Let's go drinking I'm really busy Get out of here Making peanuts? Take care of yourself, man What? Look in the mirror. You look like shit! Shut up and leave! - Okay, bro. - God! See you, guys! - Thanks, man - Drop by anytime Your virus-expert brother? He fixed the NSC system affected with the virus? - He's a chump. - Look who's talking! Stop it, man. Do I really look like shit? Gosh... This is on the house, detective. Thanks. Help yourself He's always good to you. When I arrested him 5 years ago I found worn-out gloves in his bag. So I let him go What about worn-out gloves? You've seen any thieves wearing worn-out gloves? He wore those gloves and worked hard all day Such a person never breaks the law You never know The law is... ...like a blind person. Only those his cane lands on go to jail. That's right. And the powerful walk You know what? We need to give criminals a 2nd chance That's how we guide them right. The law isn't everything! Come on I don't agree The law should be exercised more forcefully Like the Muslims do Cut the hands off thieves and the dicks off rapists It was guns that made you want to be a cop, right? Right You know what cops need most? A brain, a sense of justice, a law-abiding spirit... ...and this! - No way. It's fatherly love! To make the world safer for our kids. When you have kids, look at them sleeping. You'll know what I mean Fatherly love... By the way... If you finished your shot pour me one, kid Here you go What is it? Hush! It's a bug. My computer picked up the signal it was sending - I'll report to the boss - Who else knows about this? - Just me - Keep it to ourselves for a while You mean... Someone inside planted this? If not, who? How do I trust you then? Detective Pyo We analysed the pictures and came to a conclusion Someone else killed Capt. Cho. There's something wire on Dr. Q's site about the killing of Ju. Check it out The date has changed. Yeah, it's 3 days later He went back to the scene A 3-second-long one. Why would he do that? - Who knows? - It's Dr. Q! Did you get him? What? You lost him? He posted an article and left "If you can solve this one, you guys are good." Dr. Q didn't kill Capt. Cho? What are those numbers? I think... it's a time code. Where's the boss? I need to speak to him Time... That's when Cho got killed He'll show up at Seokchon Lake! No fucking way What? You can't make it there in 19 minutes Okay, get your bike! My bike? Having a little chat on a speeding bike... It's nice, isn't it? Shut up and don't drive like messengers do! What? If I'm a delivery boy, you're a parcel! "Block the overpass and clear the wreckage." - Accident? - Damn! What are you doing? Never ever do that again! Never ever do that again! Check this out He did him good Film it from here. Who got here first? Detective Bong from Homicide - Did you see him? - Only the back of him How did he know we'd be here? Do we have a leak? "The police arrested a suspect for the murder of Capt. Cho." "He's a friend of the victim found dead by the lake..." "He admired Dr. Q and killed his friend." You didn't have to kill the kid He was pushing me over the edge. - The cell phone? - He didn't know. - A match for the stab wound? - Right. It was made in Japan during the World War II. We have one as evidence from a 1991 murder Here's the record Hyungsuk Cho and Sijong Park were assigned to the case - Capt. Cho? - Where is it kept? At the Prosecution Office. I'll check it out. Hey, it's me. Where's the knife from the 91-2317 case? Where can I find it? They did? Okay After the trial, they took the knife. Where are you? I'll meet you there. Homicide guys are here. Should I go check on them? Let's wait. Anything? Just the kid and grandma - What's wrong? - Nothing. See you later. They're here Is Sijong involved with Dr. Q? Those STF bastards turn me off! You're getting upset You feel better, huh? Our job is no different from a mortician's. You see something bad try to forget about it Did you ask the boss? He wasn't there It's him! Wait! Stick to the basics! He looks like the guy in the montage - Wait till he gets in - Homicide guys will get him! What's he doing? We lost him because you bolted! I can't believe this. Everybody's playing his own game. What were you doing? Capt. Cho helped Song launder the money. Sijong Park is involved, too. Teamwork is more important than being a hero! You're after him, too? Yeah, Maguri identified him as his boss. We're after the same guy, and STF is shorthanded You and Detective Bong join the team Yes, sir Put him on the wanted list Yes, sir Detective Bong? Take Sijong's son to my place. Yes, sir - Verify it first. - Yes, boss Hello? Sijong? I did not kill the boy. The knife? Capt. Cho had it Why would I lie to you? Were you at the scene when Cho got killed? He was dead when I got there. What were you doing there? Cho had some money for me I can't talk about it over the phone... I called you for a favour. Take care of my boy. Don't worry about him Let's meet and talk You can't clear yourself by running! Okay - Sijong Park? - Let's go. New cell phones from Samsung! Report from your positions. Detective Ha, clear! Balloons! Balloons! Detective Bong, clear! Detective Pyo, clear! Free balloons! Have a ball, kids. - How are you doing? - You look great in it. Shut up, kid He's wearing a black hat. Hold your positions. Excuse me, sir. Who are they? Do you meditate? Not our men. What are you doing, Pyo? Pyo? - Sir... - Hold your position! What is this?! We have a leak or what?! Sijong is deeply involved Stay on him separately from Dr. Q. Watch out for the leak! Detective Pyo is okay He just did what he had to Any ideas, sir? I don't know. Kim, Suhyun Bong, Sucheol What are you doing a check on your guys for? I've got my reasons. You got caught for DUI? How much did you drink? You messed up, man. The breathalyser is hooked up to the mainframe Even the Commissioner can't do anything about it. Don't call me any more for such favours! All these flies... - You want gum? - No thanks. How can you not like gum? Have some coffee Dr. Q is up! He's just joined netizens talking about him. He's saying he didn't kill the boy. - Check monitor 2! - Which one? Where is he? He's by the river. That's not it. Monitor 3? He's... ...on the highway! Playing hide and seek? You're on! Strange... You lost him? No, I'm still on him, but this is too easy. Check monitor 2 again. He's in downtown. This must be it, then. Let's see who wins. - What's this? - No! Pull the plug! You tracked down Dr. Q? It's a Trap Virus. MX can't cure it? There's no way to fix it?! You can't go in there! - Cover yourself, babe! - Sorry What do you need to fix the virus-infected computer? Get out, man! This is urgent! Get dressed! Are we having a threesome? Shut up! Okay, wait outside. Such a lecher! - Come one! - Salute! Hurry up. You're unbelievable! This is it. She's a cop, too? You're really something. The computer! Hi - Who's he? - An expert. Trust him. A piece of cake! - Good job, bro! - It's hot. - Her number, please - Hold your horses, man. I got him! Where? Internet cafe in this area. Sir, we've got Dr. Q. It's 11-1, Shinchon. That's not it. Trust me on this. Move out! Yes, sir! - I owe you big time. - Hey, the number! Let's go. But... I'm coming with you Hello? This is Yeca Station, right? Right, but we're closed. What happened? The virus got them good. - When? - Around 4 this afternoon. It's not here, sir. Where did Pyo go? We've got another one. What? The IP address here is - Yes. - Let us look around. What the fuck! You're not old enough to be watching this, kid. Over the veranda! An orange jacket! - All right - Hurry up! He's rollerblading! Are you okay? You're that reporter! I did what I had to. No! "The suspect is dead. The situation is over." How could you let him die? Don't you know big shots are behind him? - He couldn't help it. - Bullshit! He should've arrested him, no matter what! - That's enough. - No, it's not! Asshole! Cut it out, guys! Stop it right now! Who do you think you are sending us to a wrong place! We were being tapped. I had to do so. Horseshit! Detective Bong! We're out of here! - It was sealed up? - It's a list of targets. He got it from someone. There's someone behind him. We should start all over from the Kyungtae Ahn case. Whoever planted the bugs is with the 'Ilsim Ring.' I believe Song is involved, too. 'Ilsim Ring'... Yeah, I'll call you back. Sorry, sir. - Sijong has one cell phone? - Right. See if there's a cell phone Taemoon lost. You guys track down Sijong and Taemoon. Yes, sir I had so much fun today - Safeguard the documents. - Sure This might interest you. Can we have a date today? Maybe next time It's classified Get a permit on it! I'm asking you for a favour. Is this really necessary? Do this for me, man Classified Documents Name of the documents Searching on Ilsim Ring... No documents found Searching... What is this? Searching... No files found It's been deleted. Have some coffee. I got you a deluxe one Burning the midnight oil? What are you doing here? To spend the whole night with you alone. Watch it, boy! You're so evil, girl. All right, I'll take it because I'm a good boy. Let me know if you need anything. Good morning Touch her, you're dead. Detective Bong A deluxe coffee. And these It slipped out of the pocket. You do scratches? No way! My partner bought me some. - You can have them. - No I've never done it before. I don't know how. You keep them You want to scratch them together? Sure! Nothing! How about you? I hit it, didn't I? Wow... how much is this? - Don't let him... - I hit the jackpot! - I'll call you back - I won! What's up with him? We scratched them together and he won. You need anything? Just let me know! Calm down, man. How much did you win? $1,000? $10,000? $100 You're a joke. Making all this fuss over $100? It's a lot for me, man This will get me going and let me win more! Of 3 phones Song had, one has been cancelled. Sijong has that one, then. On the day Capt. Cho got killed $100,000 was transferred to his account from Song's. Sijong said Cho had money for him. It was for the cell phone. $100,000 for a cell phone? If it has a recording function... The conversation between them might be recorded it in. What could it be about? Song's been laundering money and wiring it to Cho's account. Now that Cho's dead... The cell phone Sijong has and Taemoon are the key. Pick up Taemoon Song! Yes, sir! How are you? You're under arrest for violating financial law. Can I see the warrant? - How are you doing? - Call your attorney. What a place this is! Let's go. You wired $100,000 on Aug. 20th to Capt. Cho's account I did. What for? I made some money in the market and gave him some of it for favours he'd done me. You play other's money for yourself? That's how you make money. Some lose money, and some win. That wasn't the first time you wired money to his account How do you explain that? I'm not denying that I've laundered money. In my line of business, a slush fund is indispensible. Punish me all you want. But... Giving money to a cop friend is a crime? I'm a generous person, you know. You told us before you didn't know Maguri. Did I? Here's the evidence that you're a loan shark and you assaulted your customers to seize their collateral. This is what Sijong Park did behind my back. I've filed suit against him. I'm a fund manager, not a loan shark. Excuse us, please. Did Taemoon Song talk? Just about the money laundering. Let him go then. We can't hold him any longer I've been getting calls from politicians I'm breaking up STF. The cases are still pending. I'll set up a new team. Now that Dr. Q is dead, STF isn't needed. It reminds me of the Ahn case You put me in charge for this? I can't believe how stupid and imprudent you are. You think you can change the world? I told you not to worry, didn't I? What department are you guys in? Cops like you make this world a safer place to live in I felt the same when I first saw the late Cho. Let's bury the hatchet and be friends. Get the fuck out of here! You disgusting pig! - Law enforcers assaulting civilians? - You'll be hearing from us! It's okay. I feel great, guys Sucheol, you've got balls I wanted to beat him up, but... It wasn't balls, but stupidity. Buy some gum, Mister - What do you have? - All kinds. Here you go Thank you. - Song belongs in jail. - Tell me about it. We're closing soon. Okay. Let's move to another bar - Another bar! - Let's go! - How much? - $82. I won the lottery, guys. It's on me. No way, kid! Let your boss pay, guys. Get out of here! Come on, out! It's $82 I see, $82 million... They're cute. - You take cards? - Sure. - Balance, man! - Don't you worry! You broke our umbrella! Can't you see I'm hurt?! I've had it, man! I'm getting back at you! Stop it, guys! Help me get him out! - You've done a lot - No problem Thanks Forensic guys? - It's really Song? - Yes, sir. - You got any gum? - None on me I thought you didn't like gum. My mouth is dry. Everybody's dying, man. Hey, it's me. At the office? I need to talk to you. Right now I guess it can wait. Okay It's me, Sijong. Hang on a second Thanks for looking after my son You have Song's cell phone? I overheard him talking to Chief Ko. Their conversation was recorded in the cell phone. Song has been supporting this organization financially. Is it the 'Ilsim Ring'? I'll give you the cell phone and go to China with my son I've already arranged it Be at the Incheon Pier dock 3 by 11. Okay Detective Ha Sijong just called me Incheon Pier dock 3 at 11. Get your men ready. Watch out for the leak! "Code Red, Incheon Pier dock 3." - Get out! - No! Who the fuck are you?! Let him go! Come here, Hyesung Watch out! No! It's me, Detective Pyo. I discovered the inside rat. Call me back ASAP... Sijong Park! If you want to save your son, turn over the cell phone! Sijong Park! We know you're here! Send in my boy first! Let's see if you have the phone! Dad! Dad! Run to the big street! - Dad! - Go! Save my dad! Sucheol, go find the boss! He's been stabbed! It's the 'Ilsim Ring'! "We've found Sijong Park. The cell phone is missing." Pull over I'll be right back. Freeze! I'm sorry Hey! Get away! Put it down You planted bugs And you stabbed yourself at the internet cafe You're with the 'Ilsim Ring'? You feel the same about scumbags! We've got the law to keep! Law? This is my law! You killed Taemoon Song by your law? This was in his car. It's over. Turn over the phone. Sorry, kid When the law isn't working, it's far from over! Someday, you'll understand me! You know my boy is so proud of me being a cap. To him... That's how I wanted to be remembered! Get away! Stop right there! Shoot me if you can. No! "Was the information correct?" - "Yeah, I made a fortune" - "Good." - "Send me my share." - "Of course." "I wired it to your new account." "And I delivered cash to him in person." - "STF is on the case." - "I know." "They're sniffing around. Watch your back." "Don't worry about it" It didn't hit any major organs. Happy to be with your wife, huh? You bet. What happened to Sijong? We're interrogating him, regarding Maguri. Did you go to the funerals of detective Gang and Na? We did Sir... What's this? It's the copy of the recording. Everything's in it. You take care of it. Now you know what cops do, right? Yes! What does it take to be a cop? Be brave! Be smart! Be nice to people! No picking on friends. That's right There's one more thing that's most important. It's to have fatherly love. To protect this world for you to play safely. That's what counts the most You know Chanho's dad died He was a great cop He fought against bad guys to make the world safe If anybody asks me whom I respect the most... ...it's Chanho's dad Don't I look nice in this uniform? What are you staring at? You're cute Whatever, girl. You were good back there Just a compliment? Buy me scratches or something. - Answer the phone - I don't want to On our way, sir. A body has turned up Turn it around Okay! - Hey. - Who died? See for yourself - Forensic guys here? - Not yet. I've seen him on TV Don't touch it! Put it out Don't touch it! Don't touch it, please. We're a new STF. We'll take it from here.
