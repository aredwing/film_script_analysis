Atomic Records, I think. Dude, you know that is not the first, but the second group this week? Man, you're getting a deal real soon, real soon. Come on, how do these guys sell music when they don't got inch of rhythm in their entire body? Nah, I'm way too sober for this. Here. I had one already. All right, have half. Yeah, man. Yo, hold down the fort. I'm gonna show these kids how it's done. Joshy boy! Hey, you got this. Baby, why don't you wash that shirt soon? 'Cause then it won't smell like I work there. I'm sure employees that actually work there wash their uniforms every once in a while. Am I gonna see you tomorrow? Of course. Good. ...and guaranteed moisture repellent, your friends will think you paid thousands for your new kitchen. But at Cabinets To Go, prices start at $995 for 10 feet of upper and lower solid wood cabinets. Call now for a free catalogue at 1-800... Man, I passed out last night. Did we talk? No. What time did you get home? Around four. Why so late? We had a sewage problem at work. Had to clean the floors. They don't have private companies or something that takes care of that shit? There's no milk? Hey. You are on fire! I have a treat for you. Oh, yeah? Whoo, man. It is a party tonight! Yeah. Here you go. I had two already. Whoa, whoa, this ain't Molly. What is it? Something tight. This will take you to the moon and back, and you ain't even gonna blink. I don't know, man. Oh, come on! And I'm telling you, Pandora has landed on my brain. So, whatever you're doing right here, Joshy boy, it's about to get a whole lot faster. Ah, ha-ha! All right, you got to buckle up 'cause we're about to lift off, and we're all coming with you. Yeah, Joshy boy! Paging Dr. Bedford. Paging Dr. Bedford, please. Are you his... I'm his mother, yes. What happened? He overdosed. We flushed his stomach. He's stable. I'm going to let him rest for a bit, and I'll come check on him later. Damn it, Josh. God! You just got us both in a whole load of trouble. Damn it! Good morning, sleepy head. Your mother signed the release before she left. Said she had to go to work. Do you understand how screwed we are right now? No, you don't. You don't even care. You have to stand in front of a judge next week! I don't even know how I'm going to pay for an attorney. I don't get paid until Friday! Josh, I know you can hear me. Josh! Josh! Mr. Harvest, despite all your priors, that include disorderly conduct, drug possession, forgery, identity theft, vandalism, despite all of that, this court has decided not to inflict any more pain on your mother with any kind of prison time on your person. However, you will have to submit to drug rehabilitation and professional counselling for a period of 12 months. But with your mother's busy schedule, and given that you are still a minor in need of supervision, this court cannot take the chance you will fail to meet these requirements. Your mother has informed me that your father, Jim T. Wallace, is alive and well, and has agreed to look after you for the remainder of your 17th year, and/or until you comply with this court's order, whichever comes later. Failure to comply with all of these requirements will result in your arrest, at which point the court will determine your punishment in accordance with state law. Is that understood? Yeah. "Yes, Your Honour." Yes, Your Honour. Good, this court is adjourned. Hey. It's clean. Could have done that myself. Been doing it for a while now. Listen to me, I just can't do this alone anymore. Do what? Take care of your son? You haven't been doing it alone. You haven't been doing it at all. What are you talking about? I have been here for you since your father split. Did you forget that? For me? You can't even make rent. There's never food in the fridge. I buy my own clothes. Hey. When have you been there for me? Hey! I stopped doing drugs for you. It wasn't easy, but I did it for you. Yeah, that's a good one. What do you want from me? Nothing! I don't want anything from you. Not anymore. Why are you crying? 'Cause I'm sick and tired of you blaming me for everything that's happened in your life, okay? Are you serious? You're a real piece of work, you know that? You might just be the most selfish person I know. Selfish? You want hear about selfish? I didn't even want to have you! Your dad, he... He convinced me, making all these promises. So, I did it for him because he wanted you, and I loved him, okay? And then, he split! He wasn't even there the day you were born 'cause he split. He just left us, so don't make me the bad guy in this story, okay? Don't! I'm not a bad guy! I'm not a bad guy. Josh! Hi, I'm Jim. Come on, let's go. So, how was your trip? It was all right. Whoa. You need a hand with that? I got it. I, uh, made up your room about as young as I could. Didn't have much time to shop, so... Your mother said that you like music. Yeah. All right, I'll let you get settled. - You've reached Kerry. - Leave a message. Hey, it's me. It's shit here. Call me. Wow, that's some equipment, huh? Yeah. Uh, dinner's ready if you're hungry. I'm not. All right, I'll just put a plate in the fridge, and then you can nuke that up later, all right? Yeah, cool. All right. All right. You know how to get back? I wrote the address down for you, just in case. You can cut through the cemetery for a short-cut, go over the bridge, make a left and then you're home. Oh, you're going to need a key. I don't get home till, like, 6:00. Okay. Can I help you? Welcome to our humble abode, Mr. Harvest. Take a seat. Everyone, this is Mr. Josh Harvest. He's new in our school. Let's make him feel at home. That's DJ Sparks from New York! That's him. That dude's last video got, like, 20 million views! All right, everybody, turn to Chapter 12 in your textbooks, which covers the Salvadorian War. It took place between 1980 and 1992. Hey, what's up? I'm Tony. I noticed you have a class with my sister. That's her over there, and that guy who won't leave her alone is Michael. She broke up with him last week. What's your name? Josh. Nice to meet you, Josh. What you listening to, there? I like it! It's like electronica, right? My sister listens to the same... My sister listens to the same type of music when she's in her room by herself. It's pretty good. Who is it? I'm not sure. Oh. Well, when you find out, let me know. I'd like to download it. Hey, you like dancing? My sister's the dance team captain. You should come check them out sometime. They're not very good, though. You gonna be around here tomorrow, Josh? No choice. Cool, see you tomorrow. Shit! Joshua N. Harvest. How's it going? Alexander Weller, you can call me Alex. You can call me Al. So, welcome to your court-ordered counselling. This should be fun. All right, so let's see here. You are... a DJ. Like, electronica and stuff like that? That's cool. I heard that DJs are the new rock stars. I read that somewhere. I prefer Whitesnake myself. New York! I was born in New York. Queens, to be exact. We left when I was 5, so I don't really remember much of it. What would you like to talk about? Nothing. You got me for an hour. We got to talk about something. You like soccer? Football? Do you like pizza? He's going for it, and he gets fouled! No, no, that's a flop! That's a flop! That's not a foul, ref! That's a flop! That is a flop! Shit, man, no, no, no. You know what? That's... that's time, anyway. Hey, do you mind signing that book before you go? Same time tomorrow, or...? Uh, yeah, sorry, kid. Court order, otherwise I'd just tell you to stay home. Personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with you, but hey, there's another game tomorrow. So, works out pretty well for both of us, I think. - Hi, you've reached Kerry. - Leave a message. Or, you know, send me a text like a normal person. Bye! Hey, buddy. Come on in, have a seat. Pizza? You hungry? This game is gonna suck. Messi's out. Hamstring. Is this all we're gonna do? Watch games? Yeah. I'm not gonna get in trouble or anything? Get it back to him! Ahhh! No! No, he wasn't outside! Oh! All right, maybe he was. Why do you like soccer so much? You're not even, like, Latin or anything. Why do you gotta be Latin to watch soccer? It's the most popular game in the world, biggest in Europe of all places. And I am half-Latin, actually. American father, Argentinean mother. How'd you end up at this dead-end place, then? Commit a crime and this is your punishment? Yeah. Yeah, something like that. You gonna let me watch the game? Dinner's ready, you want some? I'm all right. Some kid from school dropped this off for you. Want me to give you a ride? Hey, Josh! What are you wearing? A tuxedo. You gonna dance? I don't dance. But you like music! Doesn't mean I dance. My sister's over there. They're about to do a dance. They always do a dance for the whole school to see. They're not very good, though. Yeah, you said that. You want to meet her? I think you'll like her. No, I'm good, thanks. Is this for real? Buddy, you mind if I step in real quick? Uh, yeah, go for it. Hey! That music I've been listening to, it's you, isn't it? Hey, man, great music Friday night. Josh, right? Hey, so my friends and I are wondering where we can get some of your music? It was pretty tight! Nice stunt you pulled Friday night. I'm only going to say this once, leave the dance team alone. You hear me? Oh, you mean Mary. Yo, teacher coming! I swear, I dropped it around here somewhere. You got to help me find it, Josh! It's my lucky coin! Please! Thanks. I got your back. - We did not fight the enemy; - we fought ourselves. The war is over for me now, but it will always be there for the rest of my days. Joshy boy! Yo, what's going on, man? How's Kansas? I'm not in Kansas, man. What? Never mind. How you guys doing? Good, buddy, you know! Just at the club. Yeah, sounds like it. Hey, how's Kerry? I haven't heard from her. I've seen her around, but we don't really talk much since you left. Look, I got to go, man. I'll call you tomorrow, all right? Don't have too much fun out there. Good morning, everybody! Please make your way to your seats. Give me your attention. We want to hit the ground running. We've got a lot of ground to cover today. We're going to start where we left off. Excuse me, Mr. West? Josh, principal's office. Oh! Quiet! The rest of you, then, your attention this way, please. I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions, see who was paying attention last time. Have a seat, Josh. Says here you wanted to see me? I did. Give me a second. Gulf War, the picture you're looking at. It was a pretty rough war. Yeah, I can imagine. No, you can't. Okay, I'm all done here. Josh, this school prides itself on a couple things, including a pretty solid football team. Been that way for years. The one thing it doesn't pride itself on is its dance team. It places last nearly every year. It's come to my attention they just had their first victory in seven years. They used a song you were kind enough to mix for them. Ah! No, thanks. You haven't heard my proposal yet. Look, I'm not interested, and you can't make me, right? So, can I go now? You may. Oh, come on! Get it, get it to Nabor! Come on, oh! Goddamn it! How come you like soccer so much? I don't know. I just do. It was all I knew growing up. That, and war. What do you mean "war"? My dad, he was in the army. Is that why you joined? Yeah. Military father, huh? What was that like? Your dad, he... He a good guy? He was a... disciplined guy. What about you? Was your dad around? Did you read my file? Yeah, kind of. So, you're living with him now, right? Yeah, and no. No, he wasn't around. He left before I was born. Oh, that's gotta suck. You gotta totally be loving living with him then, huh? Hey, you smoke, right? What do you mean, like, cigarettes? No, no, like... Yeah, I do. Why, you want some? No, no, I'm uh... I am done with that. I used to smoke a lot when I was in Iraq. I used to smoke just to calm my nerves down, you know? You see a lot of crazy shit over there. Sleepless nights, nightmares, stuff like that. They call it post-traumatic stress disorder in my field. So, what's that got to do with me smoking? Just wondered what it is you're trying to pacify, you know, inside, that's all. You don't have to live the war to live at war, you know what I mean? Uh, just a second! What's up? You don't have to stop smoking on my behalf. Just don't burn the house down, okay? Some friends of yours are here. No, thanks. No, please, just hear us out! You heard we won last week? First time in, like, seven years. Yeah, and Josh, we know it's 'cause of that song you mixed. Honestly, we were just... Like, transformed! I can't. Come on, just mix some songs for us! We'll keep you out of the spotlight if that's what you're afraid of. I'm not afraid of anything. Then, come on! It'll just be, like, one night a week. That's all, till we find the right moves to the right beat. Yeah. Okay. Great! Um, can you see if you can do something with this? Hey, can you put Mama's pills by the sofa, please? I already did. Okay, can you please take the trash out? But it's your week. I know, but can you just please help me out today? Fine, whatever. Thank you. Do you have everything you need for school? Yeah. Okay, cool. Mama, did you send out the electric bill yesterday? Mama, did you, uh, send out the electric bill? You know what? I was gonna get to that this morning, actually. I was gonna take a long walk first, 'cause I heard it was gonna rain later and I wanted to get an early start. Sounds good. Uh, let's get you downstairs. We're gonna be late for school. Oh, no, no, no! I wanted to make you a big breakfast. Maybe pancakes. Should we try to make some pancakes real quick? Yeah, I already took care of it, though, Mama. It's okay, really. But I... I want to make you something. Maybe we can have a little quick treat before you head out. Hey, buddy! I'm just gonna try to make you a quick... Mama, it's almost 8:00! Shoot, um... Okay! I've gotta take my pill. Here. Oh, can you, um... Yeah, I got it. Get me some water? Wait, I take one now, and one at, uh... Four. Four, okay. Argh! Can you open this for me, honey? I'm just gonna try to make this, um, for you guys. This was Robert's favourite. Your brother loved a bowl of cereal with dried fruit. He was obsessed with dried fruit, and he'd cut it up in little pieces and then put it in his cereal, but he had to have 24 pieces. He would count the pieces. Thank you. Oh, can you grab me some milk, too? Honey, thank you. Yup. And then... Oh, you know what? I could actually put a little bit in a bag, but I only have these bowls. See this? We're just gonna put some food in the microwave for you. Just press two minutes. Okay. Um, he would have this little bowl that we got at Disney. Do you remember that bowl? Do you remember that? You guys actually had matching bowls, but you didn't care, and he was obsessed. He could only eat in that, and sometimes I would even bring it up to him at night in bed. At 10 o'clock at night, he was 15 years old and still wanted to eat cereal! Okay, that's enough. I... I just meant... Come on, Tony, let's go. Just trying to give you a little... a little snack. I'm sorry, I didn't wake up in time to... to do more. What the hell, Angie? You guys are supposed to check with me on everything! Especially something like this! We knew you wouldn't agree! Come on, it's not totally her fault. No, you guys, we're fine without him! Okay, if it's new music we need, I can get us new music. It's not just new music. Then, what is it, Angie? Do you like him, is that it? Shut up, he's not even my type. No, it's not about that. Do you? Guys, shut up! What did you hear? Enough. Don't... Hey, wait! Yeah, look, I get it. She's not a bad person; she's just a control freak. Please, just give it a chance. Whether she knows it or not, she needs you. We need you. This school, this town, is good for nothing but for turning out future soldiers. We know it. Most just accept it and life goes on. And we may very well be the joke of the school, but we just want a shot at something different. We're just tired of losing. Yeah, I'll do it. Oh! Sorry. Let me introduce you to the rest of the gang. Okay. What is it? He doesn't like it. Tell us. Look, it's not like I don't like it. It's just that... I've seen this before. It's like you guys are trying to fit the moves into the expectations or something, instead of just feeling the... You know what? Here, let's try something. Try what, exactly? Just dance. Feel it. Nobody's watching. Just have fun. You're gonna be sore tomorrow. I'm used to this. I meant here. First smile I've seen in a while. It was nice. Thank you! You're awesome! Hey, Josh, can you listen to this? Maybe we can do something with it. Yeah, man. Cool, hey, thanks for today. That was great. Hey, you want to go to a movie? No, thanks. You know, I liked it better when you were smiling. Come on, you can go back to being angry afterward if you want. Give it up for the Mustangs! Now, are you ready? Are you ready! Give it up for your Patriots! Bye, honey, I'll see you later. Bye. Hey, Josh, come on in. Uh, Jenny, two pepperonis and a six-pack of Diet Pepsi, please. Right away. You rock, Jenny! Mm-hmm. How you doing today, champ? You ready for a big match? We got Barce versus Espagnol. Today, we're going to find out who the real Catalans are. Man, you mind if I leave a couple minutes early today? Why? I, uh, got a date. Wow, you work fast! I guess it's true, DJs do get all the chicks. I don't know about that, she doesn't even like me. Hey, girls don't go out with guys they don't like. You don't seem very excited about it. It's just... I'm seeing this girl back home, but she doesn't even answer her phone anymore. Oh, it's like that. Yeah. You know what, change is tough, kid. It's... it's tough, but it's necessary, you know? Not this. What do you mean, "Not this"? Not thi... me being here is completely unnecessary. What if your being here is necessary for others? You learn that at shrink community college? What does that even mean? I'm not here for anybody else, man. Yeah, well, maybe that's your problem. Maybe you should be here for other people. Look, nobody's ever been there for me. Why would I be there for anybody else? That's a good point. You know what? You're right. You're right, fuck everybody else. Wait a second, is it true that you flipped the music for the dance team the other night? You know about that? Yeah, of course. It's a small town, everybody knows. Yeah, yeah, I did. Why did you do that? The music they were playing hurt my ears. You could have just left. Are you gonna let this go? Mm, probably not, unless you leave, but you... No, you can't leave until 5:00. So, I can't leave early? No, no, no. This is a court order, my friend, and I run a very professional operation here. So, tell me, why did you decide to flip the music? Why didn't you just leave? This kid, Tony. He's all right. You know, his sister's the dance team captain, and everyone at the dance was making fun of them. Just sad, man. Well, that had to feel pretty good. What? To flip it on them? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it felt good. Why? Because, screw those people! They sit on the sidelines, and they're judging others 'cause they don't have the balls to get up there and do it themselves, and then, this poor kid has to sit there and listen to his sister get made fun of in front of everybody else. It's just not... It's sad, it's not cool! I bet that made Tony feel pretty good. Yeah, yeah, I guess. I'm just wondering why would you do that for him if nobody's ever done anything for you? Shut up and watch the game, man. I can hear him coming up the stairs. I'm really sorry about that. I'll just wear shoulder pads next time. The trailer looked good. Yeah, I bet! You can pick the next one. Do you still trust me? Uh, yeah. Do you want to see something interesting? Yeah. Follow me. What is it? It's a tree. Very funny. Just a sec. Are those medals? Yeah. Are you gonna help me? What kind are they? All kinds. That one is the Bronze Star. That one is an Air Medal, and that over there is a Medal of Honour. You okay? Yeah. Tony told me about your brother. I'm sorry. His name was Robert. Don't be sorry. It's not your fault. Who do those belong to? Everyone in town has lost someone to some war somewhere. It's towns like ours that the government gets most of their soldiers. How come there's nobody ever at the cemetery? I walk by it every day. People here like to pretend their loved ones are still alive. Talking about it brings them pain. It's their way of coping, I guess. But you're not like that. You don't know me. Let's go. Thanks for the movie, and walking me home. Uh, well, good night. Hey, how's she doing? Aunt Judith called, wanted to talk to Mom about Robert. Mom started yelling at her, and told her to stop talking about him in the past tense. Did you give her her pills? Yeah, you seen the dosage on those things? Those pills can knock out a horse! For days. Yeah, I know. Hey, Mom. Mama, come on. Let's get you to bed, okay? Come on. Come on, let's go. Let's get you to bed, come on. Okay. There, there. I'm here, Mom. It's okay. I miss my boy! I miss my boy. I miss my boy. Still see him... I'm here, it's okay. Don't go. Don't go... I'm here, Mom, it's okay. We'd give anything to have you back. I just don't know what to do anymore, Robert. I feel like I'm by myself. Hi, Tony. Ahhh! Hey! What the hell, man? Josh! We're in a freaking cemetery in the middle of the night! You scared me to death! I scared you, huh? What are you doing here, anyway? I'm walking ho... What are you doing here? I came to see Robert. Your brother. Yeah. Are you all right? Yeah. My mom was having one of her fits. She was going on and on about Robert. I can't stand to see her like that, so I come here instead. You're not scared? No. Why, are you? Of course not. Come on, I'll get you home. Hey, can I listen to some of your music? Yeah, sure. Hey, man. Hey. Have a seat. Do you mind if we don't watch the game today? I've got a tune I've been working on for the dance team, and I feel like it's just gonna be in my head. Uh, yeah, yeah, of course. Oh, and no pizza, either. I'm trying to get back into shape. Sure. Hey, Jenny, can you put that in the mail for me? And no pizza today. What do you know about the people here? What do you mean? I know everyone's lost someone to war, but no one ever wants to talk about it. You know that girl I was telling you about? Her name's Mary. She's the girl I went on a date with. Congratulations. She took me to this place. It's a tree with a bunch of hanging medals from fallen soldiers. You know the place I'm talking about? I do. I tried talking to her, and then she just closed off. She wouldn't open up about anything, and I'm trying to wrap my head around that. It doesn't make any sense to me. I mean, you were in the war. What can you tell me about that? You know what? She'll, uh, she'll talk when she's ready. That's it? That's the best you've got? Yeah. I thought you were supposed to know the answers to problems and stuff. Why is that a problem? Because I want to get to know this girl, but she won't open up about anything... anything personal. Getting to know somebody takes patience. It takes time, it takes the other person wanting to talk about it, and that's what a true relationship is. Do you have any friends here? I did. But not anymore. Is that one of them? Yeah. Lose him in the war? I did. You miss him? Every day. What's that? Why don't you take a look? This is a... a Medal of Honour. You have a Medal of Honour? It's not mine. Then, whose is it? It belongs to a friend of mine. Then, how come you have it? Because his family doesn't want it. Why not? You know, why don't you put the box back on the table, and we'll talk about you for a minute. Please? Why don't you tell me about the music? Where's the music come in? I was five. I remember I used to blare the music so I could drown out all my... all my thoughts. Everything else. And what about the drugs? Around... 12? How do they make you feel? Sometimes the music just isn't enough, you know? Mm, yeah, I know. Why doesn't the family want the medal? I'll tell you about that next time we meet, how's that sound? One, two, three, four! Five, six, seven, eight! Oh! Angie, you okay? Are you okay? I don't know, it just... It just hurts! Tony, go get ice. Wait, wait, no! Mary, Mary. Breathe. Top of section one and two, ready? Where did you learn this? YouTube! One and two, and three and four! And five and six, seven, eight! One, straight legs! Three and four! Can I have your attention, please? I wanted to be the first to tell you that people at the state level have caught wind of what's going on here, and our school has been invited to the state invitational for the first time in seven years! What?! With only one condition: that you win the remaining competitions. Done! Listen, there's one more thing. Our school could be hosting the invitational. Oh, yes! Hey, you need to be resting that ankle. Congrats. All right, all right, back to rehearsals. You guys are facing the Hornets this week, and they're a bunch of stingers, I'll tell you that much. Hey! There's a plate of food for you over here. If you just want to throw it in the microwave and warm it up. How's school going? Okay. How about those meetings with your advisor? The shrink? Yeah. Okay. Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. I saw this pair of jeans on sale, and uh, the lady at the store said it was a pretty cool brand. I don't know, they probably fit. Thanks. Yeah, you're welcome. Hey, Josh. Oh, hello. Hi, um, I'm Mary. Uh, we go to school together. Oh. I'm Jim, I'm Josh's dad. We're just going to be listening to music in my room. All right, sounds good. Nice to meet you. Yeah, it was nice to meet you. Your dad seems really nice. Um, that song you did for Lou was... really good. Thanks. I was actually thinking we could do something for Mia. You know, mix of a little Asian, and a sprinkle of your magic. Way ahead of you. Really? Can I hear? I'm not finished with it yet, so... You want to watch a movie or something? Um, yeah, which one? You ever seen Platoon? That's a, uh, war movie, right? Yeah. Um... I got to get going, so maybe another time? Yeah, yeah. Of course. I'll walk you home. Yeah. So, how's Tony doing? He's fine. Why do you ask? Saw him the other night at the cemetery. Yeah, he does that. He told me about your mom. He did? Yeah, it sounds rough. I swear to God that kid's gonna end up working for the National Enquirer or something. Sure seems to love you a lot. Yeah, well, he's my brother. Do you miss Robert? Since when do you get to ask me a question like that? I mean, as far as I know, you haven't told me anything about you. Yeah, there's nothing to tell. Bullshit! I mean, you don't end up in a place like this for good behaviour, Josh. So, what did you do? Why don't you speak to your father? Where's your mother? You know what, you're right. There's no reason to talk about this. I was trying to be polite. Not like I give a damn, anyway. You're such an asshole! Hey! What did I tell you about the dance team? Should've listened to me! Maybe you'll listen next time. So, the state semi-finals, huh? Yeah, word travels fast around here. Like I told you, everybody knows everything about everybody else, except for you. You know, I've been asked about you. People are very curious. And? And nothing, I can't say anything. That would be breaking the law, but more importantly, that would be breaking your trust. So, what next? You tell me. Want to talk about that? Not really. You know, kids can be mean. But I think that it's important that you understand where all that anger's coming from. Did you know what Michael lost his parents when he was young? He's afraid, just like you. I'm not afraid of anything. Except maybe love. Listen to you. You're crazier than your patients! Am I? How's it going with Mary? It's not. How come? Because she's nuts, man. Got all kinds of crazy shit going on. What kind of shit? Shit. Crazy little brother, crazy mother. Doesn't walk to talk about her other brother, shit like that. Actually, I have one for you. You have anything to do with your best friend dying? No. Were you there with him, for his last breath? Yeah. Why didn't you save him? Because I couldn't. Did you at least try? I couldn't. Then, what happened? Why'd he get the Medal of Honour? He... We were on our way back from the U.S. Embassy, and there was a bomb threat that turned out to be real. I thought it was fake, but he went, anyway. And if he'd have listened to me, that bomb would have gone off. He risked his life for a whole bunch of people he never even met. And he was the only one who died that day. Why doesn't his family want the medal? Because they don't. It's your turn. What happened with your mother back home? What does that have to do with anything? Everything, because I think there's a reason why you won't get close to anybody, Josh. And you think it has something to do with my mother? Is it because my mother didn't want me to be born? Is that it? She told you that? When? Right before I came here. I always knew I didn't matter to her, you know? I'm sorry. It's not your fault. It's mine. How do you figure that? I used to watch my friends' parents cook them food, brush their hair, take them to school. And I figured, you know, they were good kids. They got that, they deserved it. Wh... and you weren't a good kid? You didn't deserve it? I got kicked out of schools left and right. I got into fights everywhere. I started using drugs young, shit like that, man. Josh, it isn't your fault. Kids born with messed-up parents, it's never their fault. You got to understand that, man. What would know about it? 'Cause you studied it? I guess it just seems logical. So, why don't you have a wife and kids, and all that? Because I'm here. Because I made a promise. What promise? We made a promise that if anything happened to either one of us, we would take care of each other's families. So, the family's here, then? Yeah, but they don't want anything to do with me. So, your turn. Why don't you tell Mary about you? Why? What for? Listen, just tell her what you're afraid of, and maybe she'll tell you what she's afraid of. What am I afraid of? I'm not afraid of anything! Come on, kid. Be smarter than your pain. If you stand a chance at loving anybody out there, you have got to let them in. Look, I did. And yeah, I lost my best friend, but you know what? At least I know what it's like to care about somebody. Yeah, well, if helping out a town that's beyond help is caring about people, I pass. Are you okay, Josh? Yeah. Josh, you want to tell me about those? My mixing board fell on me. You okay? You just make sure and tell me if that board gets too heavy. Give a warm welcome to our guests, the Sentinels! The Sentinels, everybody! And now, your very own, the Patriots! Okay, guys, just like we practiced. Here, Mama. Oh, I'm just trying to straighten things up here for Robert. Hey. Who is it, Mary? It's no one, Mama. Look, it's not a good time, okay? I'm sorry about walking away the other day. Really, you should go. Hello. Hi. Mama, this is Josh. He's a friend from school. Hi, Josh. Well, you don't want to be rude. Would you like to come in? Come on in! It's a bit of a mess here, Josh. I haven't... Really, it's not a good time right now. Sorry, it's not how I like to have company. Forgive me. Oh, don't worry about it. Josh, are you hungry? Did you have dinner? I actually just did, yeah. Oh, okay. I'll be right back. Okay, Mary, maybe you want to offer him something to drink? I'm okay, I can't... I can't stay around long, anyways. Okay, she's... I'm sure just be right back. Oh, my God! I was just, uh, cleaning up, so that's why we're a bit messy around here. We've just been cleaning and organizing all our pictures, and I'm going through all these photos. I've been putting them in photo boxes and albums. There's, um, this album's of Mary's brother. Robert as a baby. Look at this boy. He's so handsome. That's when he first went into the army. This is him probably just about your age, right? Yeah, looks like it. Such a good boy. Always thinking of everybody, taking care of us, sending cheques every month. I don't spend the money, I'm saving it. Mom! I'm sorry, did... Did I not offer you something to drink? Oh, yeah, no. It's... I'm good, actually. Thank you. Okay. Look at this one. This is the one he misses the most. Right? Every letter I get, he's talking about her. And then, she doesn't write back, but... You kids can't know what it's like for us parents. We're just waiting and waiting... Waiting for our little boy to come through the front door. Okay, Mom, that's enough. It's just been so long. Would you mind if I... Oh. ...if I looked through this? Please, I, uh, I've got more. I, um, I've got a whole box here. I've got... oh, every boy's favourite. The braces picture. Here he is with his best friend. Look how handsome those boys are. Look at the two of them, so happy. I know... I wish Alex would come visit. I mean, he has so many stories about Robert. He promised me. He promised he would take care of my boy. I can't do this today. It's just been so long. What, uh... I'm sorry. What did she say? You were, um, you were showing me, uh... Graduation. You okay? Yeah. I'm really sorry about that. I just can't stand it sometimes. You okay? Yeah. Why are you so hard on her? She just misses her son, you know? You don't know. Last time I tried to ignore her depression, and stopped giving her her pills, she ended up in the ICU. She tried to poison herself. That's what I have to live with. Can we just talk about something else? You want to go fishing? Look, I don't know how long you're staying, but I'm really glad you're here. I have to go. Wh... why? It's getting late. I just have to go. Yeah, just wait a minute. Why are you leaving? You just don't get it. I don't get what? Nothing, you don't get anything. So, tell me! Just let me go, okay? No, not until you tell me what's going on. Why is it always the same thing with you people here? Don't judge us! You're the last person that should be judging us! No! Why won't you just tell me about your brother? Because this is not a movie for me! This is real! I have to live it every single day, and it's painful, Josh! What if you just accept it? You don't think I have? I have, okay? Then, why won't you talk to Alex about your brother's death? He was his best friend! He was there for his last breath, and you won't even accept his medal? Did he tell you why? That man is a thief and a liar! He took Robert away from us! He said that he would always protect him! So, don't you go pointing fingers if you don't know the truth about what's going on here. You have no clue what it's like to lose the people that you love, to feel abandoned by them. You don't know that! You know nothing about me! Tell me! Tell me something, anything! What did you do back home to end up here, huh? And why don't you speak to your father? He's right outside that door. Mine is gone forever! And where's your mother? Where is she? Mine is at home living in the past! You know nothing about being left behind. You want to know something? You want to know something about me? My parents abandoned me before I was even born! How's that for getting left behind? What are you doing here? We need to talk. Are you crazy? This is my house! How the hell do you know where I live? Remember that trust thing we talked about? Shove it up your ass. You lied to me. Okay, Josh, how did I lie to you? You didn't tell me your best friend was Mary's brother. That's none of your goddamn business. That is between me and that family. You knew about me and Mary, yet you failed to mention that? Well, I guessed you would find out in your own time. She told me why they don't talk to you. You made a promise you couldn't keep. Why would you promise to protect somebody when you know you can't keep that?! That family trusted you! They listened to you! And you let them down! I need you to leave. Just why did you do it? Why?! Oh, Jesus! Because it was my job! It's my fucking job, and don't you ever fucking touch me again. So, what, it's your job to lie to people? I was a recruiter in the army. I had to make a mission. I had a quota. So, you lied to him? I had a quota. And Robert was a special kid, man. I felt compelled to protect him from the day he joined up. I kept him by my side from the moment we touched down in Iraq. Yeah, I guess I... I guess I did lie to them. But I can't change that now. I have to live with that. They're right not to want to speak with me. But I made another promise, a promise to Robert. A promise that I will not break. And I will stay in this town until the day that I die to fulfill it. You can change that. I can't change it. Those are strong words to come from somebody who claims he can help people. You gave up on them. I didn't give up on them. They don't want my help. They don't want anything to do with me. Just like that? You're going to give up? You're going to throw in the towel just like that? You don't do that! You don't do that, and you're the one who told me that! When you care about someone, you have to be willing to lose. And I did lose. I lost their trust when that kid died. Yeah, he's gone, but you're still here, and that family is right here! So, don't go telling me about taking chances when you're the one who gave up on them so easily in the first place! What? You. Actually caring about other people, it's amazing. You know, I thought you and I were alike, but we're not. I'm not going to give up on them so easily. Morning. I hear today's the, uh, big day. Yeah. I sure would like to come and see you guys. Then, come. Oh! Oh, did I oversleep? No, Mama, we're just on our way to school. I just wanted to let you know we're going to be home late tonight. I got to... I got to make you breakfast. You can't go to school on an empty stomach. Today's the state's invitational, in case you're interested. Yeah, I'm dedicating it to Robert. I think he would have liked it. He was so handsome. Hey. Mama, you got two kids right here. Alive. Two kids who love and miss you so much, and that are waiting for you to be okay again. We love you. Come on, Tony. I, uh... I came here to say I'm sorry. For what? For your loss. For your pain. It's not your fault. I know, but it's not yours, either. Come on. Let's give this town something to talk about. Okay. Welcome to the North Dakota 2014 Dance Invitational. Showtime is less than two hours away. All dancers must finish signing in before rehearsals can begin. Congratulations to everyone, and good luck tonight. Hey, dude. Those headphones kind of suck. Want to use mine? Where did you get these? Don't worry about it, I got connections. Thanks, kid. That's what friends are for. Here we go! Are you all ready for the 2014 state's invitational? Taking the stage, the defending champions, the Kings! Give it up for defending state champions, the Kings! And now, the surprise of the season, and the moment I know you've all been waiting for, your host, the Patriots! You sure you're okay? I'm good to go. Let's do this. So, this is where you've been. I don't want you to leave. I'm not leaving without you. What? Someone here wants to give you something. I'm sorry. I know.
