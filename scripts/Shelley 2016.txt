Into my ear and whisper.. - Louise is recovering from an operation. - Okay. - Yeah. - She's still weak, so it's gonna be really good to have you around and help with all the basics, household and-- - yes, of course. Its a very nice area here. - Yeah. We like peace and quiet. We try to grow everything ourselves and we don't eat meat, so that's-- - okay. I'm a good cook. - Okay. - Here we are. - I can take that. - Okay. - Thanks. Wow. - Hmm. Oh, she's probably resting upstairs. Can I get you something to drink? Some water or coffee? - Mm-hmm. No. But I have to charge my phone. It is dying. - Oh, we don't have electricity. - Why not? - Why? Well, because we try to live a simple life. And we do have a stationary phone. You can use it all you want, so no need to worry. You need to feed the chickens twice a day and once a week you need to clean out the whole place. This is lotus and Lulu, and this is Paul. He's the sheriff here. He wants to decide everything. - Oh. - And then you.. ...light it all the way, the way around. - Oh. - And put on the glass again. This is too much. Like this. This is your room. - Hi. - Oh. You scared me. I didn't hear you come in. - Oh, sorry. - Hi. I'm Elena. - I'm Louise. - Nice to meet you. Nice picture. - You can just leave it there, it's okay. - Let me help you. Thanks. Must be hard work for you and Kasper to live like this. - What do you mean like this? - No power, no...Running water, no.. Everything takes a lot of time. - Oh, I don't mind. - No TV, no computer, isn't it boring? - No. I don't miss any of that. Electricity. I have to stay away from it. How's it going, baby? Didn't I tell you not to talk with your mouth full? Okay, baby. Let me talk to mom. Kiss, kiss, sweetheart. Is nicu well? Yes, I'm good. They're polite. I don't know exactly. She's a bit weird. The woman is afraid of electricity. Or something like that. - Hi. - Hi. You have everything you need? - Yeah. Is Kasper your first man? - No. - No? - Well, I'm old. - You're not old. - Well, I'm old enough to have had more than one man. - How many? His name is nicu. He is five. - And where is he? - With my parents in Bucharest. - But how can you stand it? Don't you miss him? - I do. But, you know, I'm saving money to, to buy an apartment, where he can have his own room. What about you? Why don't you have any kids? You have a big house, you have time. Have money. - Uh, we can't. I can't. - Oh. - I can get pregnant, but, uh.. ...my body won't hold the babies. The last one was in week 24. Um.. It was a little girl. And they had to cut her out be -- because she died inside of me, so.. And they cut out my womb as well so now there is nothing in there. It's, uh, empty. - So stupid. - No. Lie back and relax completely. You must focus on your breathing. Breathe out the black energies. In with the positive. Out with the negative. Release. - Uh.. Ugh. - You know, there's a difference between good and bad energies and their balance has to do with uh, you know, the bodies' inner energies and all the energies that -- that surrounds us and you know.. But if you get sick, these energies get out of balance and healing, you know, that could -- could help you. Oh, god. - What? - Do you really, really, really believe that? - I really bloody believe that. - Do you also believe in stuff like this? - Well, there's more to this world than what you see. - Why are you so skeptical? - I'm not skeptical. - Yes, you are. - I just don't believe it. - Go and watch some TV and make your brain melt. - What? - It's not funny or what? - No, it's not funny. - I'm coming. - You okay? It's fresh. - No, it is fresh in a not so nice way. Oh. I love this lake. - I don't want you to leave. Who's gonna make me laugh when you're gone? When will you have saved enough money to go back home? - Don't know. Two years, maybe three. We'll see. - Three years? - Yeah. - This might sound weird, but, um.. ...before the operation.. ...i had some of my eggs frozen and, um.. Would you consider.. ...carrying my child? Because if you take it now, we could pay for the apartment and...You would be home in nine months. And you know.. ...you wouldn't have to work. - Hmm.. Yes? What does dad say? Well, yes... Is nicu asleep? No, let him sleep. - You know what? Let's just leave this. It's time to relax. - I was waiting for...A cab and nobody was there, nothing. So, I call him and say "listen, your child is coming. Where are you?" - And you know what he said? - No. - I could hear the music in the background. "You keep it. It's your problem." - No. What did you tell nicu? - That his father died in a car crash. - Oh, that's harsh. - No, I know. I'm joking, but in a way, it's true. He's brain-dead. - Well, fuck him. - Yeah, fuck him. I'll do it for you. - What? - With the baby. - Are you serious? - Yeah. That's.. - Are you happy? - I don't know. - It's also about the money. - Yeah, of course. - But it's not just about the money. - Don't hit me. I'm not here. - Don't.. No, no, no. No... Don't do this. - Oh. - Okay. - Do you want me to leave? - No. - Are you sure? - This is going to be a bit cold. Have you experienced any discomfort since the insemination? Felt uncomfortable out of the ordinary? - Umm, I feel tired. And I have this metal taste in my mouth. - Okay. Good. You can get dressed now. Everything looks fine. - Yeah? - Congratulations. - Well, that's fantastic. That's good news. Elena needs iron supplements from now on. It will help her fatigue. "Appelsinkrokant". "Extra pappermint". - I think we're gonna survive for a week. - At least. If it's a girl, I would like to call her Elena. - Oh. - Is that okay? - No, I don't like this name. - Don't like it? - No. - Angela? - Angela? - Yes. - I'm sorry. No, that's not gonna happen. Hi. Where is Elena? She was pretty tired, so... Congratulations. - Are you happy? - Yes. Uh. I don't know. I think it's normal. Yes. Of course I eat. Listen, did you see the apartments? Oh, and how do they look? Yes, I don't know. Go also to the ones in baba novac area. Because they look good. They're nice. - Did she bite you? - Just a little bit, yeah. - Oh, you stupid chicken. Elena, you have a visitor. - I have a visitor? - Here she is. - Elena, Louise tells me you get these, uh, headaches. - Mm-hmm. - Leo is here to help you get rid of them. - Mm, really? - Mm-hmm. Okay. I want you to imagine.. ...that you are looking at yourself. You're looking at your own head. Picture your head as a room. A room with two windows and a door. Now, I want you to open the door.. ...and step inside. Now, what do you see? - I cannot see anything. It is too dark. There is no, um...Electricity. Mmm. -Now.. There is an object. There is something in this room. It's a dark thing. Maybe an animal. - It is a dog. - A dog? Now, Elena.. ...i want you to take this dog and take it out of the room. I'm dragging the dog out of the room. Out of the room. - No. - Elena? How are you feeling? - How is nicu? - He's fine. - Did you talk to him today? - Yes. So, what was going on in there? - Leo was, uh, removing all the negative energies that had...Manifested themselves in your body. And you had a strong reaction towards it. - Mm. - Oh, no, no, no, no. You don't have to do that. - I can do that. - Oh, thank god. I have to do something. I'm bored. - Well.. So, how is my baby today? - It's my baby. - It is. - Are you okay? - Mm. Oh, yeah, it's just a cramp. - Are you sure? - Mm-hmm. I had this with nicu all the time. - You sure you're okay? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - Okay. It has to drive well. Can it only drive backwards? The cake is delicious. It's a bit juicy. - It's mushy. It's really delicious. - Mushy? That's what it's called. I can't help it, that's what it's called. - Oh, there you are. - Hi, Elena. - Come and sit with us. - Hi. - Ahem. - Hi. - You look like you need some cake. - I need some cake. - Here you go. - Yes. Oh. That is a bit big there. - Thank you. - You're welcome. What do you think it will be? Do you have any idea about the sex? Normally you have some kind of feeling. I'm positive it will be a girl. Nana thought so too with sigurd, but really... It's like... boys wanna have boys, girls wanna have girls. - Maybe. - You'll see when the baby comes. - We'll have to wait and see. - Can I have the milk? Have you talked names? What's happening? What're you doing? Are you completely insane? What're you doing? - Are you alright? Elena, are you sure? - Simon. - Yes, come here. - What're you doing? You can't do that. - What's going on, huh? - Elena, are you okay? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. - I'm really, really sorry. I -- I don't know why he did that. - Oh, that's alright. - Are you okay? - Yeah. So you're going to be a dad. Yes. You're excited? Yes. Yeah, it... But it'll be an experience. I wasn't excited either. When we got sigurd. When he was born, i didn't feel anything. It only came along the way. I see. - You'll be a good enough dad. - Yes. Do you think there's something wrong with her? With Elena? Yes. No. What do you mean? What should be wrong with her? She is very thin. Well, she is kind of... She is kind of a slender type. - Well, I hope he didn't scare you. I don't know what got into him. He was acting really strange today. - It takes more to scare me. - Mm. Are you smoking? - Of course not. - Good. You're so good at it. Little friend... - Who are you talking to? - Shelley. Isn't she amazing? - So, has your baby had enough fresh air now? - Are you cold? - I'd like to go inside. - Yeah. - Come. - Yeah, this is good. It looks good on you. And it's organic alpaca wool as well. - Mm-hmm. - Because I know you love that. No, but honestly, it's -- it's really good. It's good. It's very warm and very soft. Okay, let's try it on. I don't know, you need to wear something. And, I -- I don't know. Take it off then. Oh, what is this? - Uh, my skin is dry and it -- it itches. - Oh, we need to get you some...Lotion for this. Poor thing. You must try not to scratch too much. - Hello. - Hello. - Are you okay? - Yes. - Good. - You're gonna love this. This is a chanterelle. You know? It's -- it's the king of mushrooms. - I thought you were king of mushrooms. - Ooh. Ha ha. - Take it. Oh, you shouldn't eat that much. We're preparing this wonderful soup for you. - You know? - You're so pale. Are you taking your iron still? - Oh, yes. Mmm.. - What are you looking for? - The sugar? - But if you only eat sugar and white bread, it's you know.. No wonder that you feel so tired. - Kasper, do you know? - What? - The sugar. - The sugar is right here. - There you go. - You're incredibly unwise sometimes. - It doesn't matter. I don't know. It's not so good. I don't know exactly. I can't do it any longer. I don't know. I'm tired and... I'm in pain all the time. This is not normal. Everything is very strange. Yes. - There it is. Uh, the baby is doing just fine, Elena. - That's fantastic to hear. - Yeah. Inner organs look as they should. No irregularities whatsoever. Absolutely nothing to worry about. - See. - You want to know the sex? - Yes, I do. - It's a girl. - Oh, I said it was a girl. - Yeah, and a big one. - Yeah? - Strong and healthy, a real viking. - Yeah? What? - Just a second. Well.. - No. - Never mind. We got what we needed. - Okay. - I just, I just feel like something is wrong. I know. - Everything is fine. You okay? - Yeah. But look at this. - Yeah. - What's this? - Elena has this bad habit of scratching herself. - It's not a habit. I just feel like my skin is on fire. - It's only dry skin. You have to moisturize it. You're pregnant. Skin irritation, headaches, dizziness that's all part of a pregnancy. For some women, it can be pretty awful. Believe me, I've tried it myself. - It's going to hurt me. - Elena, it's a harmless little baby and it is doing well. Trust me, I've seen this before. Okay? Okay? - Okay. - Hi. I didn't wake you up? Here you go. Are you sure you don't wanna come down with us? - Mm. I'm tired. - Yeah. Elena.. ...thank you for doing this. - You don't have to thank me. Ah! - Elena, come on. - Ah! It hurts me. - Elena, stop it. You're scaring me. What's wrong? - I don't know. - Come on. It's.. - I think the baby is doing this. - What? - The baby's doing this. - Are you kidding me? It's okay. Get out, Elena. Get out. Let me help you okay. Careful, careful, careful. - This is wrong. - What's wrong? - This is wrong. - Oh, stop it, please. - I want it out. - Elena, stop it! Elena! - I want it out. I want it out. I want it out. - Stop! Stop! Stop it. Stop it! - Out! Out! - Stop it! Elena.. Elena, are you okay? Talk to me, please. - Please take it out. Sweetheart... Go to sleep now. - Elena. Elena, what are you doing? Elena, can you hear me? Are you okay? You scare me. Elena? Is there anything we can get you, Elena? Just tell us. What do you think is wrong, Kasper? I think we should call her family. We can't. You know that if they come, they will take both her and the baby. That's out of the question. I know what you're saying but we can't do that. We have to be much, much better at taking care, right? That's what we should do. - Hmm. - I made you blueberry pancakes. With extra syrup. Elena. I know that you are...Having a hard time right now. - Please don't touch me. - Alright. - I want.. ...to go home. - I'm sorry. Ah! - You don't like the song? I can sing you another one. - I'm thirsty. - Here it is. More. You're sweating. I'm gonna go downstairs now, so you can be alone. But you can just call me if there is anything you need, okay? Elena? Elena? Elena's internal bleedings were too extensive. We couldn't do anything. What happens now? We still need answers from some of the tests - - but nothing indicates that your child has any permanent injuries. You can probably take her home soon. What is it? - Huh? - Nothing. I'm just very happy. Look here... And here comes the sun. Here you'll bathe when you grow old. Look at them staring. Have they never seen a baby? There is your daddy. There he is, the silly Billy. Hello. Why are you lying here? I couldn't fall asleep with that sound she makes. What sound? That clicking sound she makes. - Clicking sound? - Yes. Has daddy gone completely mad? Can you take her while I take a bath? Hey, you. Hi there. Are you just going to be awake all the time? Aren't you going to sleep at all? You are so awake. See you. I think being a daddy has been a transition for him. He... in relation to shelley he... He almost avoids her. He's not quite... He's not quite there and has these bad dreams. I think he thinks it's a bit complicated... being a daddy. - How is shelley? - Amazing. She's perfect. She's so beautiful, first and foremost - - and then she's awake, present and calm. Elena said something about the child was killing her. Yes. Elena was very sick. - Yes. - She said many strange things. Here comes Leo. Do you want to say hi to Leo? Say hi to Leo. Leo? Leo was here today. - Mm-hmm. He acted strange. Doesn't he always? He was different today. I've never seen him like that before. Are you awake? What's this? What's this? Just sleep. It was only a dream. - Boo. Boo. Boo! What are you doing? Huh? Are you insane? Shut up. - Shut up with that sound. - Kasper? What are you doing? Kasper? Kasper? Shh. Shh. Kasper. Kasper! What're you doing? Open the fucking door! Give me my child! Give me my child.
