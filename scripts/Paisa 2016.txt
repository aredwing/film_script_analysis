Seven bonda (snack item) and seven special tea! The currency flies. I caught it when it was flying. You are smart in catching. Look at him. He should be called as belly instead of Sappu. Leave that. For the style of his walk, people call him Nataraja. Who says so? All of them are calling Nattu...Nattu! I have never been to school. But my name is Kalaivani. There is no regards for me as an old man. People call me names. What to do? Our livelihood is like that. You have named me after lord Muruga who stands on the top of Pazhani hills with nobody around. The name suits. But I do not have anybody of my own to call my name. I should be happy that I own a name. Mari...Get a tea. Brother....Why do you still work here at this age? You could go back to your hometown and live happily with your children? They are not children...they are donkeys I work hard all the week and I go home every Sunday... give the money to my wife and have good lunch. That is my happiness I have seen. Why haven't you eaten bonda yet? You have paid for this. I thought of sharing it with you. Take it. You are good in dividing. Take the bigger one. You won't be happy if I don't eat. Take the bigger one for your size. Do not name what you prepare as Tea! Good. Let's see whether he makes good tea now. Dude...Come on. Let's go to the godown and look at the cargo.. Let's go. Get up. Hereafter...do not mix milk with water. Mix water in the milk. You people pay without credit. Is he preparing tea? There are milk covers here...! Take it! Take it! It stinks. Move aside. Did you notice the arrogance of a beggar? Beggar! I earn 500 rupees sitting in one place daily? Do you know that? Though we pick trash, we earn with our toil. We don't live a disgusting life as you. Who did you say leading a disgusting life? You! Look...I will now show who I am! What? Why are you shouting? Hello...I want to speak to our leader. President...! A rag picker speaks ill of our association. Come to the third street lane immediately in our BMW car. Stop. Stop. I am asking you. Stop. What is this? Why are you to creating dispute in my area? President...They have disgraced us. A family had a dispute for a fruit. That is divine. This is just a fruit. Look at him... sitting like lord Vinayaga in a place and earns. You are like Lord Muruga and earn moving around the world. What is the big deal? Do not quarrel. Be in peace. Give one rupee for the 4 tea we have drunk. Start the vehicle to Ramavaran. I want to meet our leader MGR. He wants his association to support him. Only the hard earned money helps. Not the one which comes without labour. The one with the red shirt at the centre... His name is Murugan. The one next with his hair spread... His name is Natraj.People call him Nattu. Sir...Director Sir! What is your doubt? It is enough sir. Are we telling story on a radio? It is visual. People are clever. They will understand. Just an introduction! Give me idly (South Indian breakfast) Wait. It is cooking. I will take vada! Never give money. Always in credit and leave!

Come here. I'm coming. Why did you call me? Take the vessel and get tea from Nair's shop. No mom. I am getting late to work. Should I go leaving the business? go Ok. Give. What is this? It has become a daily affair. Didn't know who I saw when I woke up. Look at his face. Do you think queen Elizabeth comes in front of you when you wake up? You saw my face. Here it is...mom! Disgusting face! Disgusting face! What are you bluffing? Not you dear! Will I ever say you? You are my life! Veni! I'm coming. Nothing dear! Can you please give me hundred rupees? I should fix the puncture of vehicle. Hundred rupees! You are asking as if you have given. Don't make me furious. Get lost. I should honour the appointments. Go to hell. What should I do? Will you live happily with someone else if I die? Don't put words on my mouth! You will be dishonoured. Come, let's go. Your parents are fighting. This is new to you. Come let's go. Come, let's go. You talk too much. No money in the collection. Should I give you if there is money? Who will settle the balance for rice shop owner and flour shop owner? Will you? They will look at you. Will they even see me? Look here. Is this the way to talk while we have a daughter at home! Unjust idot! Who did you address Unjust idot! Are you running a 5-star hotel? I will kill you! What do you think of yourself? You speak arrogantly just because you earn? I was calm so far. You drunkard! Go inside. You fight with me? I will break your hands and legs and make you sit.Go inside. They always quarrel. I have regard that you are my husband. Otherwise, I would have killed you. Your parents were fighting. You are silent. You have only seen what happened now. The scene will be just opposite at night. You are working at the trash Godown, won't is stink? If you think like that, then our lives stink. You speak well. Do you have a pin? No. I will get a pin and come. You hold this cycle and take care of it. Sure! Hi Veni...How are you? She has come to talk! Hi Devi...How are you? I am fine. Will you get me a job in your company? I will ask my owner... Ok. Sir....give me a pin! Do not bother about what she spoke. Take it! Don't forget about my job! Leave that. Veni....What happened to you? Why do you talk to her? You don't talk to her since childhood just because she stole 5 rupees. If it five rupees or five paise...it is theft. I don't like people who are tempted at other's belongings. One who forgives is a man; one who asks for forgiveness is a great man. Ok Virumandi. Go. Who do you think Thilothama is? If you are a manager at a mobile store, I am the manager at the departmental store. I don't have to sell sim cards aloud. I will collect money by sitting in a place. Veni! Water is poured there. Mop it and place the gunny bags in cover. Ok madam. Money is more important to us. We make top ups with great difficulty. You take my money. I should decide if I want a caller tune or not!

When I met him, I asked him how you are... he said nice and gave just three thousand. Ok enjoy...this is his treat. Great! Boss, you know people who give you three thousand rupees? I have people who can give me three lakhs! There is no one to give me just 100 rupees. Lord Lakshmi! You have so much wealth. They get 500, 1000 rupees daily. Why don't you arrange for just 100 rupees for me? Don't worry Muruga. If you learn to collect material, you can earn 500, 1000 rupees. I will teach you. As if he is a professor of Anna University who teach to pick trash in WhatsApp! Listen here. You should get long rail track, lamp post and settle soon. Otherwise, you will keep collecting milk covers, paper cups and live for a single tea. Why are you staring at me in group? I am telling you the truth. If a poor man recharge for 10 rupees, they take 3 rupees. If a rich man recharge for 500 rupees, they give extra talk time. Do you know that?

I have so much of work. The owner keeps shouting. Please try to understand. Go! No Veni...This is very important! No...Please go...I will come. No Veni...I got to tell this to you. Please try to understand. Go! She doesn't seem to understand. Shall we say to the boys? No...What if they bluff in booze? Kesav...you have been sincerely working for me for the past ten years. But you have deceived me 10 crores of rupees an hour back. See, I have locked you before even you could count the money! What is your problem that made you cheat me?! Sir...I wanted to settle my daughter and son in the US! That's why I did this blunder. Please forgive me this time sir. Kesav, as you wished... I will settle your daughter and son in America. Because I like you! You are a positive character. If a positive character becomes negative.. Sir...No sir...! Please leave me sir! What Kiruba? You wanted to talk something important to me! I have kept the money with utmost safety. But it is missing. We are searching. If you give some more time, I will search and hand over the money to you sir. You were genuine in 4,5 dealings. Therefore, I will give you one week's time. Bring it. Driver! Where have you kept what you have taken? Are you staring? Tell me the truth! I will thrash you! Sir..Please don't beat sir... It is paining! Sir! Sir! Till you are caught....you people tease us as uncle, men with stick and all that. If you are caught...Sir! I will make you puke the milk you have drunk from your mother. It is a waste effort sir. We were born and brought up in the garbage bin. We were not fed by mother. Sir...He had only bottled milk. Leave him sir. Bottled milk case or not... see what I will do now! Why do they beat like this? Nothing! Judge's wife has lost a 3 sovereigns jewel in beach, it seems! They are suspecting us and that is why beating. I would have bought them 30 sovereigns instead of 3 sovereigns. What do you say? Nothing! They beat us as of 30 sovereigns lost! Constable...Who is he? He is also connected with the theft case Beat him too Sir...! Sir...! Shanmugam....enquire without beating! Ok sir. Tell me the truth! Have you gone to the beach or not?! We have been there just for fun. Not to pick rags! Have you gone to spend time with girl if not for rag picking!? We cannot pick rags beyond our area sir. Seat allocation! Coalition Dharma! You are rag pickers... Where does area comes in this? Sir...there is no point in beating them. We need to check their place. Only then we will come to know the truth. Sir...we live in huts and godowns with our hands as a pillow. What do you have in our place? Greeting to all of you! He came on time though he looks like a crack! Greetings Inspector sir! Why did he come here? Greetings constable... Our boys are good sir. Our boys! Are they born to you or me? I said that in a flow sir. I am councillor Kanagaraj! Kanagaraj! What....? Your name keeps rolling? Tongue of a politician sir... It rolls like that. Boys are good sir. Without knowing that, It is injustice to beat them in the name of enquiry. Till the people's worshiper Manikaraj lives... I will question if there is a problem to the public. I will question! You said....Kangaraj and now Manikaraj! What is there in a name sir? You should enquire where it is supposed to be! For instance, if an auto is missing, you should enquire that to auto Shankar, right? Auto Shankar!? Yes...He is living elegantly at Thiruvanmiyur! Auto Shankar lives elegantly at Thiruvanmiyur?! You should be updated like me sir! Have you brought this man here? Yes sir, I said no...But he came here voluntarily. He should come. How can he not come here! This is a public issue Give five rupees and get 10 cups of tea to the boys. They lookvery tired. 10 cups of tea for five rupees!? Sir....leave that and lock him and inside! Ok sir. I like your honesty sir. I also like you. Let the law takes its course. One who has committed a crime should be reformed. One who has done something wrong should repent. Long live our revolutionary leader. Sir...Who is he bluffing? He was defeated in the councillor's election. He has become insane. Sir...they are poor people. Shall we send them? Let them go. You should be doing your job and earn. Why do you go to police station? Is that an exhibition to visit!? They came by themselves and thrashed us! Haven't you gone to pick rags today? Can't even drink today! Boss, have you seen today's paper news? Anything important!? Illegally hidden 10 crores of rupees caught! They did not know how to hide. It was caught. Not a big deal to steal...! It is also important to hide that. 10 crores! If I have got that...! I would have pressed it like dum biriyani. Sinners...they have left it. Do police catch if money is hidden? Not only police....Income tax, Enforecement...! CBI, CID...there are so many departments who can catch hold and enquire repeatedly as where did you get this money, how did you get? They will question what is the source of this income? The police insert their latte in your back and take it from your mouth. Not only will they grab your money but also thrash you. If the one who took the money is silent... he would have not caught! New groom and new rich are easy to identify. Groom will be charming. Rich man will be arrogant. They can be judged by their mere sight. Like our boss said..If the policemen or somebody else came to know, they will take away all the money. We should safeguard the money given to us by God. Cannot say anything to anybody! If I reveal...The money will be gone! Where are you going? As if Axis bank? Why are you locking it with such a big lock as if you have crores of rupees inside? Old tin box and a damaged mat...I was the one who comes here in the name of guest. Open it. I have a head ache. It will be like this from now! It will be like this from now! What do you want now? I have hidden a bottle somewhere here. Open. I should take it. I will get you one! Am I that cheap to drink what you offer? A foreigner gave me a full bottle in turn to my wonderful massage. I have kept that inside. Open... I have a head ache. I got to drink. You want a foreign drink, right? Go and have your drink! You should not research the source of the money. You should enjoy with what you have. Why hundred crores for one time? This is not just the dispute for money. It is the issue of my life. I won't get even 25 crores if I sell my properties and also myself. Where do I go for hundred crore rupees?! Where do I go? Relax Kiruba...Don't get tensed. You will get money. Take this. Drink. Don't worry brother. I will give my life for you if you have any problem. Get lost! Nothing is going to happen if you are raging or rushing! Kiruba....we know Ajay Chellaiah completely. He will bomb us if we are late by just minutes to return the money. We should think of what to do next! Do not make your BP rise! Listen...This is election time. Money would have not gone outside the city. Why do you worry? You should have some more money for this Kiruba! Why...? To be in Koovam! Get lost! He has come to preach! Employ our men in all register offices. See if someone new comes to register. Summon all the real estate brokers and question them whether there is an enquiry for bulk purchases! And also check the travel agent if anyone goes on a world tour! Check the star hotel bars and see if anyone if fully drunk! Enquire in brother houses too! Ask the police to check all the vehicles! More than half of the money is in American dollars. Nobody can exchange dollars without the knowledge of Omar's men in the bazaar. As Kiruba said, if we perfectly follow we can find the money! Don't stand. Go and do something. Stop. Stop. Will it go to Poora Mall? What...? Poora Mall?! There would be many big shops inside! Near Vadapalani! Oh! Forum Mall!? Yes...That is it! Get in. Three hundred rupees to reach there! Is this the first time auto ride for you? Yes brother. Yes brother. I used to travel by car always. I have decided to ride an auto today for a change. We have arrived. We have arrived. This is the place. Stop. Stop. How much? I have already told you! Three hundred rupees! Keep it. Sir! Tell me sir! What do you want? I want a coat! Coat is in downstairs! All are latest models...! Take what you like! Sir...Would you like to try this model? That! Here it is, sir! It suits me exactly! Thirteen twenty rupees! Is this the five star hotel! Good material! What is this? This is the menu card sir! What do you like to have? I did not understand! Sir...you can order anything from this! What is this...? This is fully written! I did not understand. This seems to be new. Bring this item Sir..That I Mr. Sham... Our GM sir. Cannot eat! Please order something else. I will bring. Oh...Don't get caught Muruga. Order with the help of the picture! This colour is good. Bring this! Buffet Mughal Biriyani! Would you like to have something else sir! Enough! One item will do! Ok sir...Any salad?! No...! I am confused! Ok sir...I will bring! Bring more onions, brother! This is reebok shoe. Not that brother. You are wearing it wrong. Fashion! What fashion! Done! Take it! Sir...That is finger bowl for washing hands! It is good. Give me one more. That is only for washing hands... only for the purpose of washing hands. I will wait...Bring. Soosai will deal only cross account. And feel bigger. That is Switzerland, Ireland, Netharland, Tireland, Yugoslavia, Mississippi... We have secret agents in these countries. VIP's give money to me and I deposit for them! He seems to be a rich agent! I will deposit their money without missing 5 paise! Ok...I will definitely call you when I get money! Ok thank you. Call me immediately! Ok Next VIP! Brother...Can I give money in the counter? Please wait sir...! I will bring the bill! Ok, then. Bring here. You...You...! My property is inside that. I can't run with the shoes. Even I cannot run with my body. He looks decent but very cheap fellow it seems. He ran away so soon. Where did he go? Drove me furiously! He must be local! The bag looks high. But, dirty inside. Couldn't get even 10 paise! He has dishonoured my trade. What is this? My property! Keep it. Then! Long running! But no use! Yes. So what!? Please give me something! Five hundred!? Heavy tired! Thousand?! Add some more please! I am stealing for that property! Two thousand! Shall we continue this after two days? You will be beaten with shoes. One cannot run the business if he is afraid of his honour. Where are you? Just now they said you are in the beach! Don't lie. With whom are you in the beach? Oh! He looks like Murugan, with coat suit? Is he Murugan! He is our Murugan indeed! Brother! How much do you get for this stuff? I would give this stuff for 300, 400 rupees! 500 rupees! Take it. Give that. Hold this! Thanks. Welcome Kiruba sir. Nobody came for new registration. It is all as usual. I will inform you if someone comes suspicious. Let the vehicle go bar. Brother...Did anyone suspiciously come inside? Separate the milk coversand keep it aside. Ok brother. Come on Muruga. All others have come and left. You are the last one. You have taken good stuff. Look at it brother. 40 kilograms...! It's worth 400 rupees. Hold the bill! Muruga...You have become wiser. You have brought good material. You will prosper. Yes boss. Can I be the same always? I have learnt the nuances of the trade. How much is the account? 400 rupees...It is 400 rupees. Go and spill this bundle. Take it. I will take leave boss. Then....Send these PVC pipes to Mariyappan godown! Ok...Bring! What is he carrying so heavily? God! Boss...Shall we weigh the stuff? The same paper! English paper boss! The same 65 kilograms! It's exactly 65 kilograms, boss! How come you are bringing the same 65 kilograms on a daily basis? Boss...A man shouldn't have too much of desires. A contended mind is a continual feet. If I get 65 kilograms... I won't desire more than that. You? Are you going to chop me for saying a philosophy? Not you! No boss! Dad...What is happening? Why does the English paper inside talks in Tamil? Boss...! Open that...! Open! Untie that! Untie that! I will come to know about your play today. Dad...He says he will chop me and you are silent! I felt like peeing inside. Leave that. Are you a father? People say so, boss! You make your livelihood with your child! Only today boss...! Please forgive me. Just today...! You have deceived me for the past three months. 90 days.... have deceived me daily for 65 kilograms! Totally 2700 kilograms! The accounts are perfect! What are you murmuring,.... fraud? Nothing boss! Listen...Both father and son should work in my shop for the rest of your life! For this type of survival...go and hang with your family I would have fielded my wife instead of my son. I would have earned much, I suppose. How dare! Ask me any type of unofficial help... I will do it for you. Get more than you are paid by the government. Thanks Linda. Sir...! Let's go. I will come with good news. Omar bhai! Nothing big Kiruba! As usual smaller dealings! No one has exchanged dollars in large numbers. I will inform you if there is bulk transaction! I trust you! Chella Pandi! Yes madam! Any news!? No...Nobody brought anything today, madam! Be alert always. Inform me if there is any news! Kiruba...Don't be tensed. You will get back the money! You need some relaxation now! Muruga...would you like to eat some? Give me! Muruga...You have learnt to collect the stuff with good material! We are getting tea free of cost. Shut up. Drink whatever you want brother. I have learnt to collect good stuff now. It is me who taught you. Why are you running, Muruga? If we could find the person the matter will be over. If we get it we will be promoted sir. Definitely! Sir...What are you searching for? Should we tell you?! If you tell me...I will show you their home with the name! Are you a spy? Shall I put you behind the bars? Get lost! Sir...Is that the house which is locked? I have a doubt too. He has gone out it seems. Sir...He is here. Catch him. Catch him. Come on. Come on.Where have you kept the hidden thing? Where are your friends? Dude...! Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid that I saw your money. I am telling you the same thing as I told you earlier. Enjoy with the money you have, dude. Do not research the source of the money. If you do that, this money won't like you anymore. A small request! Marble palace Taj Mahal....! This is one of the wonders of the world. Didn't know whether it is built by Shah jahal to Anarkali or Akbar to Mumtaj. But someone said it is in Delhi! But history is important, dude. If I visit there just once... I will become happier. A small help! If you can give me just 50,000/- rupees....! I would go and come back! Do not count dude...! While you count it spills... It is enough if you give that. I will visit that. I won't tell this to anyone, dude! It is my promise. Why are you counting? Give that bundle. Thanks. I won't talk to anyone till you are alive, dude. I will take leave. Bye. (Singing a famous song) Why are you searching Murugan? I haven't seen him in the past two days. He is not attending my call. I don't know what happened! You said you know his house! That's why I have come with you to meet him. Murugan lives here. You are going to live here too. So make friends with the people here. We shall take care. This is his house. Look there... He is locking his house. Hi...Welcome Veni! Why have you come this far? Why didn't you meet me for the past two days? Not even a phone call? I was busy and also I was suffering from fever for the past two three days. Have you taken medicine? Did you go to the hospital! Open the door...! Let us go inside and speak! Let us talk while we walk. She has come home for the first time. Why do you make her wait outside? Take her in! She doesn't seem to understand. She is surveying the place. She should not see the money. Shall I apply medicine to you? No Veni! Shall we go outside? Money! I have! How? There was a document in the garbage. I returned it. They gave me a lot of money. Really!? When you are in my heart! You have blended! Celebrations and festivity! When you are in my heart! You have blended! You have toppled me! You have toppled me! I have no ID, pan card and account number! No logic, No magic! Didn't know how I got! No heads, No tails! Cannot understand top and bottom! Lord Sukhra came in search of me! When you are in my heart! You have blended! Celebrations and festivity! How many zeroes for 10 and 100? I knew because of you! I am a zero who became a hero because of you. The loser I have become wiser! My deity! You are the one who entered my heart! Shall we get married, lady? We shall take a procession with our love? People envy us! If I go with you together, dear! Hello sir! Hello! Hello sir! Hello! AC sir..., do you have any news? I am checking all the vehicles. Nobody has taken huge amount of cash so far! Don't worry. I will catch them for sure. I will then inform you after taking their custody. Please watch carefull sir. I am watching! Nobody can escape in any checkpost. I will come with money in short time... Tell this to Kiruba! Ok ...Please take care. I trust you. I will take leave. Ok..Let us meet. Take the pavement. Go that side. Don't send children that way. You are not supposed to go there. Come this way! Why are you hurrying? Go back! Marimuthu...! Measure this house. This side! Only of the hut is completely demolished for 30 feet...! Hold it straight! ok sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Who are you sir? Why are you going into my hut? Will you go on the side or shall I take a stick and beat? There is 30 feet inside sir! Sir...What are you going to do? Will you understand if I say? Let us do our work! Why have you brought bulldozers here? You people have occupied the government's property. Will they allow? How many notices have been sent so far? And how many warnings made! So! This land belongs to highway. 200 feet ring road is about to happen. Take your belongings and leave. What about the huts here? All the officers, JCB have come to demolish everything! Are you going to demolish? Yes! Are you going to demolish? Are you a youth wing official? Won't you allow demolishing? Sir...! Are you going to demolish today or tomorrow? Today! Right now! In another five minutes! Sir...Sir...! Please give us one more day! We shall take our belongings! We have given you a lot of time already for months and years. Did you respect that? Sir...sir...please! If we keep giving time for every hut... It will take a week's time to demolish. Stop...Stop. You cannot demolish. We have got a stay order legally. You have got stay order at the eleventh hour and stopped us from doing our duty. God is with us, sir! Government wants us to demolish the huts. The same government says no through the court. This play will keep happening. Let us move. Did Vajpayee say truth always triumphs, simply! The deer is caught again. Let us deal with that, dude! Don't be afraid, dude...! Don't be afraid! This is the money God has given you. It won't go anywhere! God has saved it at the last minute. I have told you already. Leave that dude. Let me tell you why I have come here. I visited Taj Mahal because of you, dude! Shah Jahan has built that with Marble to MumTaj. Look at this. There is a place called Goa, it seems. Foreign girls lie naked on the ground to get sun tan it seems. I wanted to see that very badly...! What shall I do? Dude...it is possible for you. Just a small help! Fifty thousand! I will never ask you again, dude! Last and final! I have already given you. I cannot give you anymore. Go! So...you won't give me! No! I will take care, dude. I know few people. I will take care. Did you inform the police? If I say so they will take all the money. It will not be useful for the both of us. If it is with you I can get something whenever I wanted. This is your money. If you live happily with this it is enough. If you are kind hearted... give some money, dude. I am begging you. I will get money. I will even pay you back. This is the last time. This is my promise on my grandmother. I will never ask you again, dude! Listen. This is the last time. You should never ask me again! I won't ask you even if I die. I will never ask you. Stop the vehicle. What happened? Kiruba...Look there. This is the rope of our bag! That slipper should belong to the one who took the money. By the size of the slipper... He must be young. No outsider would have come this far. Must be some local dog! We should get back the money in two more days! Catch him. Hundred crores is a small amount. This can be deposited as cash in Swiss bank. This is not a big amount at all. Linda....Take Dharma and lawyer to the hotel! What for, Kiruba? You are lucky man. You have brought hundred crores from Koovam! But one thing! After depositing, you should give me my commission one percent as hot cash in a suitcase. Sure brother. After depositing in Swiss bank...Can I go to Swiss and take the money? This is your money sir. You can take it via net from your home, sir! You can take it in ATM, sir! You can take it from Koyambedy Market, sir! Money mrket! Switzerland, Netharland, Ireland, Tireland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Mississippi... We have secret agents in these countries. They will help you. I will trap you to them. What...Sir? I will connect you to them. I mean connection. Is Kiruba afraid and sent you all here? Where have you kept the Hundred crore rupees? When will you hand over it to me? The cash is ready. Whenever you say... I will give it in your hands. What happened? We are searching sir...! We will definitely find it, sir! You should not talk like policemen to me. Have you got yet or not? That's it. I am leaving to US in two days. I should see my money before I go to the airport. Or, you all will see Kiruba's dead body. All out! Give me the hundred crores tomorrow. I will deposit it for you. Where are you coming from? You keep absconding! 100 crores! Get up. Get up. Since he was duped by duplicate swiss bank agent... He has become mad! This is my fate. I don't know what to do? He is mad! If I have missed...I would have lost money and also caught! Hundred crores! Careful! He says he got if from Koovam! I don't know what to do with this mental. I have lost everything I had! Somebody....Mad...! In Ezhil TV programme...! Let us go to Goa in this episode! Why don't you order for beer? Brother...I will get next time. Excuse me sir. Yes. Are you a Tamilian? Chennai Tamilan! Is this your first trip to Goa!? Silly question...! I celebrate weekends in Goa. I catch friday evening flight and land here. I celebrate Saturday and Sunday here. And go back to Chennai by Sunday evening flight. Brother...He seems to look like our Kuppam boy. He is enjoying in Goa! He seems to be bluffing. Let us watch what he does. Have you come to Goa alone? Is this a graveyard to come single? This is heaven, madam. Tell me your favourite song. Shall I tell you or sing? You can sing? (famous song) He seems suspicious. Get him at once. Stop the vehicle. Come here. Why are they calling us? What about the thief who roam with you people? Where is he? He is roaming around places. I haven't seen him' He visited Taj Mahal last week! Brother...He came back from Goa just now. He has a lot of money. If you happen to see him the area... you should inform us...! Ok? He must be wandering somewhere here. Search him. Come on. Let us go. Come on...Let us go and search everywhere. (80's popular song) Why are you dancing happily? Rag pickers...? Is anything special here? Are you kidding? Just now for goons came in search of you. Seem like thugs. They are furious with you. Is it? What did you say? Yes. What else did you say? We have told that you go around places... Visited Taj Mahal and lately visited Goa. We told all these with a lot of pride. Murugan's money must be problematic. He shouldn't be caught and so am I. They have tapped us. He is jealous. Can you please tell me? Brother...I told you have a lot of money! You speak these well. You all have drinks, cigarette, biriyani with the money I bring. What else did you all say? Where did they go? Stop. They have gone this side... Go carefully. They are furious. I am caught. He told about this area. Are they the thugs who came in search of me? Instead of dying in their hands, the garbage bin is safer. Where does he go..? He is not seen anywhere! They said, he must be wandering somewhere here. He will be trapped definitely. It stinks badly! Couldn't tolerate! I would have died in their hands. He is finished if he is caught. Brother...He came this side... Haven't you seen him, yet? Sinners...Haven't you all gone yet? Search completely. You can get him. We should get him for our Kiruba! Anjalai....Come soon! You said idlys are sour. What is the hurry before I throw it away and come? He is a small time thief. He cannot leave that place at all. He will be finished if caught. I am not going to be caught and not chutney too. Let us search in the next street. Come on. Thank you very much flour. The flour that has saved me! Thank you. They have built it beautifully. Shall I buy this or the white building near central station? No. Maintenance of that building is tough! Brother...What are you staring for a long here? How much does this building cost? Close to 5, 6 crores! Only 5,6 crores! Go. Don't play pranks! Tell me Veni. They have arranged my marriage with my cousin! I cannot live without you. What shall we do now? Don't cry Veni! I can never get married to anyone else. Will you come wherever I want you to come? I will come wherever you want me to come. Ok leave. I will make an arrangement now. I will call you after making all the arrangements. Be ready. Come to the place where I say. I will be waiting for you. Will you be able to come? I will come definitely. Don't worry for anything! I will call you too. Muruga...! Yes brother! Our Sappai....! He went to clean the drainage for meagre 300 rupees. He is suffocated with the poisonous gas and got admitted in hospital. What do you say? Yes. The boss is not in town too. Didn't know what to do! Go and see him soon. What happened to Sappai? Why are you late? He is too serious. Go and see him. He is inside. Sappai! Come muruga Do they say he will die if the payment is not made?! Nothing will happen to you. Everything will be alright. Will I live? Nothing will happen to you. Do I live? I may die. Can you spend the expenditure? Do not talk anymore. I will make the payment. Please save me. Please save me. You will live a hundred years. Everything will be alright. Wear the mask! Nobody should disturb him. What did the doctor say? The lungs have to be operated and it may take one lakh rupees it seems. Sappai. Do not worry, Sappai. I will take care of the expenses, Sappai. Nothing will happen to you. You will be alright. We are there for you. I will take care of the expenses. Come quicker. Brother...Pay the bill there. No...I will come back and then pay. Ok. The three lakhs you have asked for is here. Somehow save my husband, brother! Kiruba... There is a call from Ram Prakash! Tell him that I am in the hospital and will meet him later. Ok. Which room? In the second floor! In this situation, he has taken a cut and lying in the hospital. He will bring how much ever bigger the amount may be. This is not a big deal at all. Standing on the way! Move aside! Thank God. I was not seen. The money he has got is from...! How...? That is none of your business. We just need one lakh rupees. It will come. The operation will happen. Do not ask unnecessary questions and confuse your mind. Sir...This lady has stolen one lakh rupees from the office. You robber...! How dare you pay the bill with the stolen amount? She won't reveal how much she has taken! She will tell only if she is treated in the station. Do whatever you want. Beat, kick, stab with foot, kill or even hang me. But, please save my husband! She speaks sentimentally. Drag her form here at once. Do not enquire her here. Take her to the station and enquire. Collect the full details of her aides. There are a lot of people who are hiding a lot of money. These types of cases should be handled in the station. You will find a lot of money. Go. Go to the station, write a report and then get back your money. Thanks a lot sir. Come here. Do not talk without knowing the situation. That is Kiruba's money. Kiruba is inside the hospital. Listen to me. Somebody took the hundred crore rupees dumbed in the Koovam Kiruba is searching for him murderous rage. The one who has taken money will be definitely caught! When he is caught, Kiruba will bite him badly like a hunting dog. He won't sleep till he gets back the money. I will talk to you later. Ok...ok...let's meet in the evening. The drainage patient is very serious. He cannot be operated till the money is paid. Please send that patient to the GH. Murugan's phone does not ring. He is mocking. It is time for operation. Murugan didn't turn up yet to pay the bill. We didn't expect him to do this conspiracy. He has shown his immaturity! Do not trust him. He will not come. He has betrayed. Everybody...hop on. What happened? Sappai! You have left us! Is he dead? Is Sappai dead? You have lost your life for just three hundred rupees. What happened? Shut up! Are you human? He asked you, whether he will be alive. His death is unjust. Is he dead? Is Sappai dead? He is not dead. You killed him. You have killed him. Please try to understand. Is money that important to you than a life? I am a thief. I am a thief. I have spent the money with you. Have I ever thought of stealing that money? Not only Sappai died. You have killed the friendship along with him. Get lost. Nothing is in between us anymore. Get lost. Do not come. Instead of asking money from you, it is good to die falling in a well. Not only for Sappai's death, he shouldn't attend anybody death. Tell me Muruga! Where are you? I am at the shop. I have made all arrangements for us to leave. Ok..I will come.... Where should I come? I will be waiting for you behind Koyambedu greens market road. I will come. Trust me. Will you come? Why do you ask this? You are my life! I come trusting you. Take good care of me. Let us live a happy life forever. Please come, Veni. I will come. Let me disconnect. If you come here anymore on this regard, that's it....! Veni...! I am coming. Clean this rack. Ok madam. Whose phone is this? That is mine, madam! You are getting 5000 payment and own 50,000 worth phone? Be careful. You too don't get deceived by a man. Have it. This phone costs just 800 rupees. Muruga...Are you going out of station? Yes brother. I am thinking of going back to my place. Is it? Come on...Let's have some tea. Go ahead brother. Veni will come now. I will call you once she comes. Please proceed. Come on, Veni. What is the cost of this phone? Why do you want to know that now? Tell me...How much? 800 rupees! How much did you say? Why are you beating me? I said it costs 800 rupees! You are lying. You have shown what a scoundrel you are? This costs 50,000 rupees. Where did you get that much money? Why do you want to know that now? I have a lot of money. You will be happy if you see that. You will be happy if you see that. Everything is for us. We have all the money we need to live all our life. Where did you get this much money? Everything is for you. Take it, Veni! I asked you where you got this from. I didn't ask for whom does it belong! Why are asking this? Are you not happy by looking at this much money? Don't you have a desire to enjoy this? The world will not look at us with who we are. It looks us how much money we have. All our stains will be wiped off with this money, Veni. Anybody can live in this world without parents, siblings, spouse and children. But one cannot love without money, Veni. Don't you have the desire to enjoy life with this much money? There is a different name for someone who smiles at the sight of money. I am not that kind. Do you want me to indulge in your crime? Someone will come in search of this money one day. You lie to hide this money now. One day you may even kill to safeguard this money. You cannot be trusted. Listen Muruga...your peace, happiness, laughter will leave you if you have this money. You should eat happily and have good sleep. One should never worry about what will happen next, Muruga. I met you as a rag picker when I saw you for the first time. Not as a millionaire. I liked the honest Murugan who do not want someone's money. I wanted to live a happy married life with that Murugan. You are not that Murugan. No Veni...Listen to me for a minute. After talking so much, your greed for money didn't vanish? Forget me. As per you, your Veni is dead. Not only today. You should never visit my corpse. Oh girl! Oh girl! I have missed this gem! Dear! Dear! I have lost my mother's lap! Is money that important to you than a life? As per you, your Veni is dead. Not only Sappai died. You killed our friendship along with him. You should never come to pay respect to my deadbody. I don't need you. I do not want you. I do not want you. I have lost my Sappai because of you. I have lost my friendship because of you. The one who was rubbing shoulders with me has left me. I don't need you. I do not want you. I do not want you. My life did not stink even when I was a rag picker. But it stinks after you arrived. Deity Lakshmi ...It is true that asked you for money. But I do not want this money now. I want to be happy like earlier. I don't need this. Ask team A and Team B to be ready at GN Chetty road. Hello. Sir...This is Murugan speaking. Which Murugan?! The one who grabbed you keys for a child? Oh...Tell me! Sir...I have got a bundle full of money from Koovam! Bundle of money from Koovam?! Yes sir. I have taken it from Kasi theatre Koovam. I will bring it to you and give sir. Where are you now? I am at my hut, sir! Put the money as it is from where have you taken. Ok. I will take care of the rest. No one should know this. Ok sir. We shall go and seize the money hand over to the department. No....no...no....no! If we do that we do not know to whom it belongs! Let it lie where it was thrown. The one who has thrown will definitely come to take it. We will wait and watch. Come. The time Ajay Chelliah gave us is over. We should hand over the money before he kills us. Whoever looks suspicious should be nabbed. Fill up the diesel tank. Haven't brought the cash, Kiruba! Stop the vehicle at the ATM near river Koovam! Linda...Ask AC to collect this footage. Zoom in. Who is he? He is a rag picker!? A rag picker!? Nab him. Get down. Do not leave anyone. Beat everybody. Who are you? Where is Murugan? I don't know about him. He is not found here! Let the vehicle to Kuppam! The time given to Kiruba is over. Finish him. Muruga! Muruga....! Where are you going? Don't worry Muruga! I will tell everything to them. I will tell everything to your Veni and friends and make them understand. Don't worry, Muruga. I will leave. Murugan will come this way. All of you...stop. They are Kiruba's men! Come on. Let's go. Come on. Murugan is there. Muruga...Kiruba's men are searching for you. Come on.Turn around. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let us go soon. Push it soon. Muruga! Do not worry about anything. Go! People fear me so far. You made me feel the fear for the first time. You made me wander with no food and sleep for a week. He should not die soon. He should be killed slowly. Cut each of his body part. I should see. They have nabbed Murugan and won't spare him. We have lost Sappai and should not lose Murugan too. We should save Murugan at any cost. He is in the line. Sir...Your money is safe. It will come to you in half an hour's time. Please ask your men not to chase me. What is the sound there? AC...Don't do anything. We got the money! No Kiruba...! The police and Income tax department knew about the money. They are on the way to arrest you. Try to escape from the place at once. Who is that? Where are you? Start the camera! I cannot tell anything right now! Only after the enquiry, I can reveal you everything! Today's headlines...! In the early morning raid... Hundred crores of rupees were seized from business man Ajay Chelliah. Thug Kiruba, has also been arrested with him. Forgive me, Muruga. I misunderstood you. You knew me now. That's enough for me. Welcome sir. Murugan...How are you? I am good sir. You didn't desire for the unclaimed hundred crore rupees and handed over to the government. In appreciation to that gesture, the government rewards you with 10 crore rupees. Take it. Congratulations. I do not want this money, sir! Why ? The peace I have now is enough form With this money...please raise the standard of living of the people like me. I trust you that you will do whatever you can for people like us. Thanks a lot sir. Ok...I will think what best I can do with this for you people. I will take leave. What you did was good. It will be of great help for people like us. Thank you sir!
