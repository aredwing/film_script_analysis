Although a simple man... he was not so simple that he did not know... when it was a weekday and when it was Sunday. And although the church bell was sounding... and all the little shops were closed... and there was no one in the square, he knew... this was not a Sunday. Seor. Forgive a poor ignorant beggar, seor... but today is not Sunday. They're ringing the bells and... there is no one in the streets. Can't you read? No, seor. Well? Seor. Today is not Sunday. I am aware of that. There is no one in the street. I'm aware of that, too. And the church bell is ringing. And you want to know why, is that it? Yes. Well, I'll tell you why. Today is a holiday. A public holiday. A day of rejoicing. And we're all rejoicing today, aren't we, seores? Do you know why we're rejoicing? Because our beloved Marques is getting married today... and we have to rejoice. By order. By order. Landlord, get me a drink. Isn't that a good thing? And who will have to pay for this wedding? We shall. And who's paid for the bride, poor child? We have. Yeah. Who's paying for that feast that's going on... at this very moment up at the castle? We are. I haven't seen you here before. What are you, a beggar? Yes, seor. If, from the deep charity of your good heart... We've nothing to spare, my friend. That's where all our charity has gone. Yeah. If you want some of it, you'd better go there. And God knows, I wish you luck. The beggar took the man at his word... and climbed the long road to the castle... where, as he had been told... the Marques was celebrating his wedding day with a feast. Stop. What's the matter, my dear? It... it looks so... Don't you like goose? Why have you prepared goose... when the Marquesa doesn't like goose? My lord, I didn't know. Oh, why didn't you know? Why didn't you know? Have mercy, my lord. Pick it up. Well? If, from the deep charity of your noble master's heart... Go away, man, before he sees you. Who is it? No one, my lord. Just a beggar. Well, bring him in. Welcome. I'm afraid you were so late that we started without you. Noble lord. If, from the deep charity of your good heart... If only you'd let us know. If you could spare a little bread... A little earlier... a whole goose would have been yours. But now, as you see, everything's gone. Not a crumb left. Don't tease him. Why not, my dear? He's a man, not an animal. Oh, is he? Yes, I suppose he is. Would you like to have him, my dear... As a pet? How much do you want for yourself? Two pesetas? Five? Ten? Ten pesetas, my lord? Done. Now, he's yours, my dear, your very own pet. What would you like him to do? Give him some food and wine. Excellent. Wine for our new guest. And food. Later. Wine, wine. More. Not in that piddling cup. Here, fill this. Yeah. Go on, give him more. Uh-uh. Food. I must have food. Oh! You must sing for it first. Yeah. Come on, sing, sing. I can't sing. Dance, then. I can't dance. Anyone can dance. Music. Dance. Dance. Please. Give him something to eat. Here, dog. Here's your bone. Come on, come and get it like a good dog. Time for us to retire, my dear. My bride and I bid you goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Thank you, seor. Have a good night. You insolent... Don't forget, he's mine. A wedding gift from my husband. I don't want my gift to be damaged. You're quite right, my dear. He must be looked after. You, see he's looked after. And so the beggar was imprisoned... in the castle dungeon. Time passed. And he was forgotten. The only people he ever saw... were the jailor and his little girl... a serious child who could not speak. Here, you give it to him. He's your friend. The years passed. And the beggar remained a prisoner. Now, completely forgotten by the Marques. The old jailor died. His daughter grew up. But still, she could not speak. The vile temper and foul tongue of the Marques... had sent his wife to an early grave. And lost him the few friends he possessed. Now he lives a recluse in his own rooms. And what's your name, my dear? Don't be frightened. Just tell me your name. Your name, my dear. Your name. Your name. Ah! No, you don't. You are a lively one, aren't you? Why don't you show me just how lively you can be? You come here tonight and show me, huh. The little vixen. I'll show her. Who was that girl? My lord? The one that just went out, idiot. Just a servant, my lord. Used to work below, my lord, in the dungeons. Used to work below, did she? In the dungeons, huh? You're to stay there until you've learnt your manners. And to be a bit friendlier. Come to your senses, have you? Somehow, I thought you would. You know where you got to go now, don't you? Who is it? My dear. The girl hid in the forest for some months... where she lived like an animal. It was here that I found her. There. That didn't take long, did it, seor? This will soon put some color... back into her cheeks, poor mite. Fancy you finding her like that. The angels were certainly watching over her. You should take some of this before you catch a chill... getting yourself all wet like that. Well, I suppose if you hadn't... she would still have been lying there. Instead of tucked up snug in your spare bed. I'll make some for you when I come down. Do you much more good than that stuff. It's a lucky thing she didn't lose her baby. Her baby? Here you are, my little one. Drink this. It'll soon put you to rights. No. Now don't try to speak. Just take a sip or two of this. And you can go back to sleep again. That's a good girl. A little more. Good. There. Now you go right back to sleep and let my herbs... soothe away your aches and pains. What did you say about... Shh. A baby? In a few months there'll be a little baby in the house... if the good Lord spares her. What's your name, my little one? Oh, come now, you needn't be shy with me. You haven't spoken a word since you've been here. Nobody is going to hurt you. Now tell me, what's your name? Oh, my poor child. You poor little thing. You poor lonely little thing. Teresa's new interest... gave me the peace I needed for my work. At least, it did, at first. Here's your nightcap, seor. Leave it there, Teresa. Seor, I'm beginning to be a bit worried. What about? Of course, you may think me superstitious. I think... You may think me superstitious, but... I've seen a good deal more of the world than you have. The real world, not what you read about in your old books. You know, it will soon be the 25th. 25th? Of December. You know what that means. The 25th is always on Christmas Day. Well, then? Christmas Day is always on the 25th. Of course, if you're going to make fun of me... No, I am not making fun of you. I don't understand. What's the matter? What's worrying you? What worries me is that the girl upstairs is about to have her baby. And as like as not... it will be born on the very hour of our Lord's birth. Surely that should be a reason to rejoice? For an unwanted child to be born then... is an insult to heaven, seor. That's what I was taught. In the village where I come from... the girls stay away from the men in March and April... just in case. Let's pray the little child is born too soon. Or too late. Otherwise... Don't worry. We'll have it born exactly to suit you. Oh. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hello, what's this, then? Nasty, that is. Very nasty. Dominique, you lost any goats? No. Why? There's a dead one up here with his throat torn out. Very nasty. That dog of yours been behaving itself? Now, listen... if there's a dead goat up there... with its throat torn, it can't be him. It'll be a wolf. A wolf, eh? Yes. And you're paid by us... to keep things like wolves away. A wolf, eh? Hello, Pepe. Where are you off to so early in the morning? Uh, got to see the mayor. Got to report a dead goat. While you're about it, you better report a dead kitten. Kitten? Yes, I found a kitten dead in my garden this morning. Horrible state it was in. Throat torn out. Oh. Little Leon's kitten, too. It'll break his heart when he finds out. Yeah. I think there's been a wolf about. Well, whatever it was, it certainly made a mess of that kitten. I didn't dare let the little fellow see it. No. No. He can't stand the sight of blood, can he? No. I remember the day he came hunting with me. Nearly fainted when I shot a squirrel. Cried his little heart out. Well, I better not keep the mayor waiting. Goodbye, Pepe. Oh, there you are, Leon. Ready for your breakfast, my angel? I'm not hungry, Aunt Teresa. Oh, no lunch yesterday, and hardly any supper last night. This won't do. Come, I've made some of my hotcakes for you. You like those, don't you? You seem to be falling down on your job, Pepe. You're employed as a watchman... not to loaf about all day, letting a pack of wolves come up to the town... stealing our goats from under our noses. But I've always tried... If it hadn't been for Dominique here, the goats might never have been discovered. But it was I who... However, I have no wish to be unduly harsh. I'll overlook it this time. Now get on with your job. I want those wolves dead within 24 hours and... delivered to me here at the town hall, do you understand? Yes, seor. 24 hours. Not a minute more. You may go. There, rest quietly. You'll soon be better now. Try to sleep, my little one. I did shoot it, I tell you. It was a young wolf. I saw it and I shot it. Where is it now? Disappeared into thin air, I suppose? Yes. I lost three goats last night. And I lost two. I can't help it if things won't die when I shoot them. Want to get yourself a new gun... or a pair of spectacles. Or stick to water. Come on, let's report this to the town hall. I did shoot it. I did. He must have got up during the night. It's the only explanation. He must have got up... come downstairs... and gone out. But if he'd come through here, I'd have heard him. You'd be asleep. I'd have woken up. He never came down those stairs. You mean he climbed out of the window? I just mean he didn't come through here. Oh. There's only one way of finding out. Now. I want you to tell me everything, Leon. Promise? I promise. And truthfully. Yes. Where did you go last night? Go, Uncle? Yes. I know you went out. Where did you go? I was in bed all night, Uncle. Oh, Leon, you promised to tell me the truth. I am telling the truth. Then how did you get hurt? I don't know, Uncle. You couldn't have been hurt like that in bed. I know I was in bed, Uncle... because I woke up in the night. I had a bad dream and woke up... but then I went to sleep again. What did you dream? I don't really remember, Uncle... not very clearly. But it was like the other nights. Other nights? I have bad dreams every night now, Uncle. I see. Tell me, Leon, when did these dreams start? I think it was after I went out hunting... with old Pepe. He wanted to show me how to shoot. He wanted me to shoot a squirrel, but I wouldn't. So he shot it for me. He pulled the trigger... and the little squirrel squeaked and dropped. It was horrible. I picked it up and tried to kiss it better. I kissed it, and I tasted something warm. It must have been the blood, but it tasted sweet. I wanted to keep on tasting it, but Pepe took it away. I did wrong, didn't I, Uncle? No, no, I don't think so, Leon. Ever since then I've had bad dreams, Uncle. What do you dream? I dream I'm a wolf, like in a picture book. I dream I'm a wolf, drinking blood. Help me, Uncle. Please help me. Yes, I'll help you. Yes, it's one of his, all right. Where did you find it, Teresa? I-it was embedded in a tree trunk up near the pastures. Oh, so he did miss. I won't breathe a word about it. Ah, thank you, Teresa. It would break his heart. He's been so upset as it is. Will you have a glass of something? No, thank you. I must go. There are elemental spirits about us... at all times, my son. Spirits without bodies... of creatures that have never lived. Some say it is to prevent the invasion... of these roaming spirits... into the highest creation of God's sculpturing hands... the body of man... before whom all beasts must kneel. Some say it is to prevent this invasion that... man's body stiffens into rigor mortis... at the moment of his death. Roaming spirit entering the body then finds only a... dry, unwelcoming shell. But, Father... And you're wondering... what this has to do with little Leon? Yes. I'll tell you, my son. Sometimes, it so happens that... the spirits of one of these beasts... finds entrance into a body... while it yet lives. Usually at the moment of birth. Then, the soul and the spirit war with each other... to gain mastery of the body. But if the soul of the man is strong and clean... we'll generally exorcize the spirit of the beast... before it is many years old, but... if for some reason, the soul is weak... an inherited weakness... an accident of birth, then... I see. A werewolf. That is what he is, my son. A werewolf is a body with a soul and a spirit that are constantly at war. The spirit is that of a wolf. And whatever weakens the human soul... vice, greed, hatred, solitude... especially during the cycle of the full moon... when the forces of evil are at their strongest. These bring the spirit of the wolf to the fore. And in turn... whatever weakens the spirit of the beast... warmth, fellowship, love... raise the human soul. Now... little Leon has no real father or mother. And yet he needs their love and care far more than any normal child. I understand, Father. And I shall do my best to replace that love. I know you will, my son. But is there no cure? Only love. When he is older... he may meet a young girl... whom he will love very deeply. But what is more important... she should love him very deeply. Then he may be saved. It was no ordinary wolf... gentlemen. No ordinary wolf... would tear out the throat... and drain blood. Drain blood? Every last drop. Well, if it wasn't a wolf, what was it? Last night... was the night of the full moon. And do you know what that means? What? Here. Who's going to pay for all these drinks? Give it to him. It means that... things are abroad. Things? What sort of things? Strange things... that should not be spoken of. Good day, seor, seora. Well, whatever it is out there... my husband will get rid of it. Won't you, my dear? Just gonna give this a clean. Ah. That should keep your nightmares away. Yes, Uncle. I'll have a wolf steak and potato. Now, listen all of you. I've had just about enough of this. If any one of you makes another insulting remark... about my good husband... he goes out of that door. I hit that animal, fair and square. Must be dead. I... Pepe, you might have lent me a hand. Oh, what's happened to my crucifix? I had to do it. It was the only way. But that crucifix was blessed by the Archbishop himself. So much the better, my dear. Leon. Leon. So it was you all the time. Leon grew into a fine lad... and the care and affection that Teresa and I gave him... seemed to cure him completely of his terrible sickness. Now, if you don't like the place, you come straight back. Promise? I promise. Why you can't stay here and work with your father, I don't know. Now, Teresa, it's only natural he should want to make his own way in the world. I admire him for it. Thank you, Father. Oh, but working in the vineyard... Oh, Teresa. Goodbye, Father. Goodbye, my boy. Oh, your money, have you got your money safe? It's here, Aunt Teresa. Well, Teresa? We must thank God, seor. He has given Leon back to us. Who are you? Oh, I'm Leon Carido. Seor. Seor. Are you strong? Oh, yes. You look strong. Do you like work? Yes. When I'm paid for it, seor. You better come in. This is where you'll work. The hours are 7:00 to 10:00, with a half hour for lunch. And the pay's six pesetas. You sleep in there. Jose here will tell you what to do. My name's Leon. You heard mine all ready. Jose. Welcome. He, uh, said you'd tell me what I had to do. Oh, it's easy. There's the wine, you see? Red in there, white in there. There's the bottles... and there's the labels. You put the wine inside. You put the labels outside. Who's that? Well, uh, The old misery is Don Fernando, but you know that already, don't you? Uh, the young misery is young Gomez... his father owns this place. And, uh, the pretty one... the one you really want to know about. That's Fernando's daughter. And to start you asking your next question, they're engaged. That makes Daddy Fernando very happy. Does it make her happy? Well, what do you think? I mean, just look at him. Drive on. Wave, child, wave. Really, Cristina, I think you might try and be more gracious to your future husband. She's coming this way. Well, it's not to see you. So don't get yourself excited. I've, um, come to apologize, seor. Apologize? It was you we splashed, wasn't it? With the carriage? There's no need for you to apologize, seorita. If I don't, I'm sure no one else will. My name is Cristina Fernando. Seorita. And you? Leon. Leon Carido. I've, uh, just started work here. I know. I, um, hope you'll be happy here. Thank you. I'm sure I shall. Yes, I'm sure you will, too. It's very unfair. This is the third evening running you've had a headache... and we've had to come home early. I can't help having headaches, Rico. No, but it's beastly inconvenient, all the same. And I was winning, too. 100 pesetas, I stood to win... If it's the money... No, it's not the money. What is it, then? Well, it-it's very unfair, that's what it is. Hey. Look. Oh, well. Wish you were real, darling. In the absence of anything better to do... I'm for bed. Don't wear your eyes out. And don't use up all that candle. I've got better things to spend my money on. Hey, talking about money, you know what tomorrow is, don't you? It's Saturday. We must celebrate. Celebrate? It's payday. Music and dancing. Don't forget that candle. Good night, Rico. Thank you. Good night. Is that you, Cristina? Yes, Papa. You're back early. Enjoy yourself? Yes, Papa. Good. Straight to bed, now. Yes, Papa. Oh, I thought you were never coming. I thought I'd never get here. This is just a dream. No, no, this is real, Cristina. What if my father finds out? Come away with me, Cristina. If it were only as simple as that. I love you. I know. I want you to marry me. I can't, I can't, you know that. It's all been arranged for me. I'm to marry Rico Gomez. Marry me, Cristina. Oh, my father would never let me. I'll speak to him. Let me speak to your father. Oh, you mustn't. Promise me you won't? He'd send you away. We'd never see each other again. He'd see to that... Anybody there? He must have heard us. Tomorrow? I can't tomorrow. Sunday, then? Sunday. I've never heard anything so ridiculous in my whole life. Staying in on your own on Saturday night. Pay night. It's unthinkable. In fact, come to think of it, it's downright immoral. All right. I give in. Now, that's better. Where do we go? Oh, do you like good food, wine... fine music, wonderful dancing, and... beautiful girls? There's this place I know, just outside town. It's quiet, mind, very respectable. You all right? What's the matter, dear? You are not feeling very well. Why don't you get some fresh air? Come on. Go out on the terrace. Wishing on the moon? Did I make you jump? Sorry. Anyway, it's a new moon you wish on, isn't it? What? You are slow, aren't you? Don't you feel very well? No. No, I don't. What you need is a little lie down. You can come up to my room, if you like. Oh, don't worry about her in there. We can slip up the back way. Your friend wasn't feeling very well. He's gone for some fresh air. Oh, doesn't he look pretty? Charming. Waiter, more wine. You don't care what you spend, do you? Money is no object, my dear. Bravo. This will make you feel better. Not very talkative are you, dear? Still... I like a man who doesn't chatter. I get enough of that from the other girls. Here... why don't I make you more comfortable? There. That's better, isn't it? What's the matter, dear? Worrying about your girlfriend downstairs? She won't miss you, dear. Not for just a few minutes. You all right, dear? Careful. Here. What's the idea? If that's what you came for, you came to the wrong place. I've a good mind to... How much longer does your friend expect me to sit here by myself? I shall personally supervise his immediate return, my dear. Don't speak to any strange men. Really. Leon? Leon, where are you, my little friend? Leon? Come on. Every night for the past 13 years... you've been on about that dog of yours. Now keep quiet about it. I've had enough. The best dog that I ever had. You had to shoot him. Yes, I had to shoot him. He was a killer, that's why. He keeps the bullet around his neck to remind him, round his neck. I keep the bullet around my neck because it's made of real silver. The best dog I ever had. Ah, go home. Leon? Leon? Leon? Leon? In God's name, what happened? Your clothes, you... You can't... No! No! No! It's the truth, my son. I won't believe you. I can't. There, there. Leon? I must ask you once again. Can you remember anything you did? Where you went to last night? No. But try, please try. I can't, I tell you. I can't remember anything. The blood. There was blood on my hands. Where did I get blood on my hands? That's what I'm trying to find out. Perhaps it's the blood of some animal. A sheep, maybe. You mean, I killed it with... With... There, there. You knew about this all the time, Father? But you didn't tell anyone? Thank you. What am I going to do? Tell me, what am I going to do, Father? I think I can obtain permission for you to enter a monastery... under special supervision. But... until then you must be... chained, and watched night and day. Oh, yes, that's right, isn't it? You chain up wild animals. That's all I am. An animal. Hey, you. Sargento. Why, that's him. Are you Leon Carido? Yes. A friend of Jose Amadayo? Yes. I understand that you were both at a certain establishment last night. Owned by a Seora Zumara? Yes. According to a Seorita Yvonne, you left early. Is that right? Yes, yes, I think so. You think so? Well, I had a lot to drink. Where did you go then, Seor Carido? Home. Home? Are you sure? Yes, I've just left there. You just left there? I see. Why... Why are you asking me these questions? Just making some inquiries. Good day, seor. Good day. Seor. Well, I hope you feel ashamed of yourself. Seor? Going to a place like that. Getting drunk. Disgusting. Don Fernando? Tell me. Has anything happened to Jose? I neither know nor care. Probably in jail. You're very fortunate that you're not there with him. Help me. Leon? Get away! Get away! Get away! Leon, what's wrong? No. Get away. Leon? Leon? I must go. Before father finds out I've been with you all night. All night? All night. Careful. You've been here with me all night? Yes. Tell me, I must know. Did... Did anything happen to me? You hurt your leg. You were frightened and screaming... No. No. Did I change? Did my face change? My hands. Did anything happen? No, Leon. You have saved me. Oh, God, thank you for sending her to me. We must go away. Now, today. You must marry me, and we must go away. Leon. We'll start a new life. A wonderful life, Cristina. We'll be together every minute of the day and night. Tell me what's wrong. Cristina... do you love me? Will you marry me, Cristina? You say you love me, will you marry me? Yes. Yes, I will. My darling, this is terribly important. But you must trust me until I have time to explain better. We must go away. Now. Today. Please don't ask anymore questions. Will you come? Yes. Yes, I'll come with you. Are these your clothes, seor? Yes. Leon Carido, I must ask you to accompany me. But why? I'm arresting you on a charge of murder. In God's name, listen to me, will you? You must send for my father. You must, don't you understand? You must! Listen to me, I tell you! Listen! My boy... there is only one thing he'll listen to. Look, I'll pay you. I'm willing to pay you. What do you want, seor? I want you to send somebody... to fetch my father, Seor Don Alfredo Carido. How can I possibly leave here? Must be somebody you can send. Well, there is. Send somebody to tell him I'm here. I need him. Seor Don Alfredo Carido. He lives at the outside of the square. The big house at the top of the steps. Well? What do you wait... Here. Now, hurry, please. Leon? Leon, where are you? Leon? You all right? What do you think you're doing? Where were you going? Come on, where were you going? You were going with him, weren't you? You were going to run away with him, weren't you? Oh, I say. You were, weren't you? Yes, I was. What? And I still am. You ungrateful little... Where is he, Father? Please, where is he? He is right where he deserves to be. Where is he? I must go to him, Father, he needs me. Needs you? I'll bet he does, the debauched young... Will you please tell me where he is? He's in jail. That's where he is. Prison? Yes, prison. Why? What for? What do they say he's done? I'm not interested in what he's done. I just know they have taken him away. And good riddance. Rico... will you please take me to him? What? I want you to take me to the town. I shall do no such thing. Well, then, will you lend me your carriage? What's that? Certainly not. Then I shall have to take it. Cristina? Come back here at once. Come back. You're to drive me to the town. It's an order from Seor Gomez. And hurry, please. Cristina? Come back. I have already killed three people, Father. Can't you understand this? Strangled them with my hands. Savaged them with my teeth. That has yet to be proved. Proof. They'll prove it, all right, because it's true. And if they make me stay here tonight, it's going to happen all over again. Don't think these are going to stop me. What can we do? We must go to the mayor. Appeal to him. No, not appeal. Tell him... tell him what I am. Tell him I have confessed to everything. What? Tell him I have confessed. That you must have me executed. Now. My son... Yes, now. Before sunset. And, Father, you must tell him how it must be done. Burned. Burned... Burned alive. No, this is too much. It's preposterous. It's too much to expect me to believe. Nevertheless, it is true. How long have you known of this, Father? Since he was a child. And you did nothing about it? I wasn't certain. Then why are you certain now? Why? You have only to ask my son, and he will tell you. Your son, a murderer. Yes. What is it you want me to do, then? Please, hand the boy over to me, so that I may take him to a monastery... where he'll be looked after. No. That's impossible. No, the boy will have to stand trial. If he is kept in this town until after sunset, he can't be responsible for his actions. What do you mean? I mean that he'll break out of prison and kill. Kill wantonly and savagely. Like an animal. And you... you will be responsible. There he is, seor, that's the one. You there. Stand up. Let me look at you. Let me see your hands. Now your teeth. Open your mouth. Come on. Seor, I beseech you. Don't make me stay here. Now, I shall require other witnesses. There's Teresa. Teresa? Yes, my servant. Your servant? I'm afraid I cannot... Let me in. Let me in. Let me in. Cristina. Silence! You must let her in. She can help me. She's the only one. I wish to see Leon Carido. Leon. Seorita. What are they doing to you? Help me, Cristina. Who is this? Who are you? I'm Cristina Fernando, seor. You know the prisoner? Yes, seor. Well? We are engaged to be married, seor. You are engaged to be married, are you? So you know all about him? Seor? You know all about his affliction. Affliction? So far as you know, this is a perfectly normal young man? Yes. Thank you. The prisoner will remain here and stand trial. Gentlemen. Come, my child. Leave her with me. For God's sake, have pity. Leave her. Come. Come. Please my child, come. What are they doing? What's happening? Father, the bullet. Pepe the watchman has a silver bullet. Get it and use it. Use it on me, Father. You must use it, do you hear? You must use it. You must! I don't believe you. But you must, my child. It's the truth. It's not true. It's not true. Please tell me it's not true. It's getting dark. Pepe? Pepe? Pepe Valiente. Hey. It's a beautiful evening. The moon is just rising. The full moon. It will soon be as bright as day. Ah, Teresa... this young lady has nowhere to stay. She is a friend of Leon's... and I thought, perhaps... Come in, my dear. Well, I must go back to the church. I will come here after service. My dear, you're shivering. Come and sit by the fire, and I'll get you a warm drink. Leon. Guard! Guard! This will soon put some color into your cheeks. I can't think where Don Alfredo has got to. There was something about a silver bullet. Pepe's silver bullet. So, it's come to that at last. Come to what? What is this bullet? A silver bullet... made from... a crucifix. The only bullet that will kill... a werewolf. What is it? What happened? What you said. Where is he? I don't know, seor. There he is, up on the roof. Did you see anything? No, what's happening? There he is. Surround the house. Just guard it. That's it, guard it. You stay here. I know how to get him down from there.
