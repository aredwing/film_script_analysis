[ Sighing ] You aint leavin right away. You stay awhile. Ah, well, long enough to see Baby Suggs... and you. Where is she? Dead. Oh, no. - When? - Eight years ago now. Almost nine. Was it hard? I hope she didnt die hard. Soft as cream. Bein alive was the hard part. Sorry you missed her, though. Is that what you came by for? Thats some of what I came for. Rest is you. [ Sighs ] Truth be known... these days I go anywhere they let me sit down. I wouldnt have to ask you about him, would I? Youd tell me if there was anything to tell, wouldnt you? Id tell you. You know I would. So you dont know nothin either. [ Sighs ] Halle, Halle. [ Grunts ] [ Horse Whinnying ] We got spare rooms. Could stay the night if you had the mind to. You dont sound too steady in the offer. Oh, its truly meant. Its just that I hope youll pardon my house. My house. I like the sound of that. Come on in. - Come on in. - [ Chuckling ] Good God, girl. What kind of evil you got in there? It aint evil. Just sad. Come on. Step on through. I- I thought you said she died soft. Thats not Baby Suggs. - Who then? - My daughter. - The one I sent ahead with the boys before I run off. - She didnt live? - No. - Boys too? No, they alive, I pray. They run off just before Baby Suggs went and died. Probably best. Ahh! Negro boy got legs, he ought to use em. Sit around too long, somebodyll figure out a way to tie em up. Ahh! - By yourself then? - No. Got the girl I was carryin when I left Sweet Home. You had that baby, did you? Damn, I didnt think youd make it. Runnin off pregnant, all by yourself too. - [ Footsteps ] - Denver! Come here, baby. I want you to meet somebody. Paul D, this here is my Denver. Uh, mornin, Miss Denver. Its a pleasure.

Of course he know your daddy. He from Sweet Home. Yeah. Sweet Home. How come everybody who run off from Sweet Home cant stop talkin about it? It looks like if it was so sweet, you wouldnt run away. Girl, who you think you talkin to? True, true. She-She right, Sethe. It wasnt sweet, and it sure wasnt home. But its where we were, all together. Come back whether we wanted to or not. [ Sighs ] We have a ghost here, you know? - [ Liquid Pouring ] - We met. Denver, heat up that stove. Cant have a friend stop by and dont feed him. Oh, dont go to no trouble on my account. Bread aint no trouble. The rest I bring back from where I work. Least I can do workin dawn to noon is bring home supper. Got any objections to pike? If he dont object to me, I dont object to him. Why dont you spend the night, Mr Garner? That way, two of you can talk about Sweet Home all night long. Denver, what is the matter with you? I never known you to behave this way. [ Crying ] [ Sniffling ] Mama, I cant no more. [ Sniffling Continues ] I cant no more. You cant what? What cant you? Cant live here. I dont know where Im gonna go or what Im gonna do... but I cant stay here! [ Sobbing ] Nobody speaks to us, nobody comes by... nobody even knows Im alive. Oh, Denver. Come here, baby. - Its all right. - Sethe. Im a grown man... with nothin new left to see or do... but I tell you it cant be easy... a young girl livin in a haunted place. Maybe you ought to move. No. No movin. No leavin. Its all right the way it is. Its all right. You wanna tell me its all right, Sethe... and that childs half outta her mind. [ Clattering ] - [ Denver Whimpering ] - Hush, I say! I got a tree on my back... and a haint in my house... and nothin in between but the daughter Im holdin in my arms. No leavin. No runnin from nothin. - You hear me? - [ Mumbling ] I will never run from another thing on this Earth. Come on. You can sit down and eat... - or you can leave us be. - [ Sobbing ] [ Grunts ] Lord. What tree, Sethe? Huh? I dont see nothin growin on your back. Its there all the same. Chokecherry tree. Leaves, branches. That was 18 years ago. - Happened that night. - That night? - [ Screaming ] - Tree could have cherries by now for all I know. I aint followin you, Sethe. I had milk, Paul D. [ Chattering ] I had milk, see? I was pregnant with Denver... but I hadnt stopped nursin my baby girl... before I sent her and the boys off. [ Crying ] All I knew was, I had to get milk to my baby girl. I thought we was talkin about a tree. We was all supposed to meet in the cornfield. None of you came. I had to leave my children, go back lookin for Halle. Thats when I saw you in the shed. Sixo dead. Schoolteacher done gone and burnt him. Paul A too. They hang him from a tree. Said you were gonna run no matter what. I didnt think you would make it to the gate. - I went back in the barn to look for Halle. - Animal. Thats when Schoolteacher saw me. [ Schoolteacher ] Whats it taste like? Came in there with his boys after me. Youve got animal characteristics. Them boys took my milk. Thats my babys food! Thats what they come in there for. [ Screaming ] Hold me down, take it. I told Miss Garner on em. [ Sethe ] Theyre lyin, the animals! She had that lump on her neck and couldnt speak. But her eyes rolled out tears, I remember. Them boys found out I told on em. - [ Screaming ] - Youre horrible and beaten up! Youre horrible and beaten up! Schoolteacher had one of em whoopin up my back. And when they closed... it left a tree. They used cowhide on you. And they took my milk. They beat you and you was pregnant? And they took my milk. Oh, Lord, girl. [ Clattering, Baby Crying ] [ Crying Continues ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] Goddam it! Hush up! [ Barking ] [ Sethe ] Denver! Denver! Move! Move! Get outta the way! [ Paul D ] Leave this place alone! I said, hush up, goddam it! Paul D, look out! Paul D! [ Paul D Groaning ] - Paul D! - You wanna fight? Then come on, goddam it!

I was thinkin of lookin for work around here. - What you think? - Hmm. Aint much. River mostly. And hogs. Well, I never worked on the river... but I can pick up anything heavy as me, hogs included. White folks here better than Kentucky... but you just might have to scramble some. Well, it aint whether I scramble, its where. You sayin its all right to scramble here? Better than all right. Your girl, Denver, it seems she of a different mind though. You dont never have to worry about Denver. She a charmed child from the beginning. Gotta know one thing though, Paul D. This here aint no better life. Just not that other one. What I do here-- all I ever do... is keep Denver from that other one. Wont let the past in my yard again. You understand? Dangerous to love any one thing that much, Sethe. The best thing is to love everything just a little bit. That way, if it breaks or runs off or is taken away... you know, maybe, you still have a little love left over. Hmm. Well, thats the way it is, Paul D. If I have to choose, well, aint no choice. Thats the whole point. I aint askin you to choose. I just wanna know if theres a place for me. If theres more than, You can stay, its fine. More like, I want you here, Paul. Maybe we ought to just leave things the way they are. Sethe, Im not sayin this cause I need a place to stay. We could make a life, girl. A life. - I dont know about that, Paul D Garner. - Leave it to me! See how it goes. No promises if you dont wanna make none. Just leave it to me. All right? [ Hoofbeats Clattering ] - All right, well see how it goes. - [ Sighing ] Youre willin to leave it to me? Some of it. Some. Okay. Okay. Heres some. Theres a carnival in town.

I think the baby got plans. - Maybe. -# I know your house # [ Sethe ] Maybe so.

Pick em up off the ground now... so we dont have to wash em again. Come on. Whoo! Almost didnt make it. Spread em out. Beloved, put that sheet down now. Spread it out. Keep it up off the floor. # [ Singing ] Where... your diamonds? Diamonds? [ Chuckles ] What would I be doin with diamonds? On your ears. Wish I did. Come to think of it... I had some crystal once. Present from the lady I used to work for. Tell me. Tell me your diamonds. Wedding present from Miss Garner... back at Sweet Home... when Halle and me got married-- what they called married back there and then. Guess she saw how bad I felt when... I saw there wasnt gonna be no ceremony, no preacher. I never saw you with no crystals. Gone. Long gone. Come here, girl. You best unbraid that hair. Come on. Get the comb. Its right here. Ow! That hurts. Comb it every day, it wont. Your woman... never fix up your hair? My woman? You mean my mother? Mama dont talk about all those things. Tell me. If she did, I dont remember. I dont think I saw her but a few times out in the field... once workin indigo. By the time I woke up mornings, she was in line. Hmm. If the moon was bright, they worked by its light. Sundays, she slept like a stick. Tell me about her. I remember, once, she picked me up and carried me behind the smokehouse. Only thing I do remember, in fact. She opened up her dress, and right on her rib-- right here-- was a circle... and a cross burnt right in the skin. She points at this mark, and she says-- she says to me... This is your maam. Im the only one got this mark now. The rest all dead. Somethin happen to me, you cant tell me by my face... you know me by this mark. Scared me so I couldnt think of nothin to say... so I says, Yes, maam. But how you know me? Mark the mark on me. Mark me too. Did she? No. She slapped my face. I didnt understand it then. Not till I had a mark of my own. [ Beloved ] What happened to her? Hung. Maam. Whats the matter with you, maam? Why they hang your mama? I never found out. Was a lot of em. [ People Crying ] - [ Bones Cracking ] - [ Woman Sobbing ] Paul D be here in a minute. Hope this puddings good tonight. Denver, pass me your plate down here. Paul D. Where you been all them years... since Sweet Home, Mr Paul? Aint you got no people? - You wanna know about me now. - Uh-huh. I got no people. Eighteen years since I left Sweet Home, and Ive been walkin the whole time. Move, walk, run, hide, sometimes steal and move on. Only time I stayed in one spot for more than a month or so... was with a weaver woman in Wilmington, Delaware. Meanest place for a Negro I ever seen... outside of Pulaski County, Kentucky. I seen Negroes so stunned and hungry... they lived in caves, fought owls for food. Seen some who slept in trees in the day... and moved only by night... who buried themselves in slop to hide from... posses and lawmen and regulators. Met a Negro boy once-- about 14-- - who lived by hisself in the woods... - [ Sighing ] and said he could never remember livin anywhere else. Seen a witless coloured woman hang... for stealing ducks she believed was her own babies. In all these years, girl... you beat all. I aint never seen a Negro like you. I think its time you tell us a little somethin about yourself. She dont remember nothin. Oh, youd be surprised what you start rememberin soon as you start talkin. Aint you got no brothers or sisters? I aint got nobody. Paul D, stop it. Denver, help me clean up this table. I wanna know, Sethe. What you lookin for when you come here, Beloved? This place. I look for this place I could be in. Somebody tell you about this place? She told me. When I was at the bridge, she told me. How you come? Who brung ya? I walk here. Its a long, long, long, long way. - Nobody bring me. - You wearin new shoes, gal. - If you walked so long, how come your shoes dont show it? - [ Sethe ] Paul D. Stop pickin on her. I wanna know! Where you get them shoes and the dress you had on? I take the shoes, and I take the dress! The shoestrings dont fit. Ill teach you how to tie your shoes. [ Gagging ] Beloved. Beloved! - [ Coughing ] - Beloved. Beloved, Beloved, you all right? - Let it out. - [ Hand Hitting Back ] Go to sleep now. [ Denver ] You can come in my room. I can take care of you up there. [ Crying Continues ] Whats the matter with you? What is it about her vex you so? I dont understand what the hold is. Its clear why she hold on to you. I just cant see why you holdin on to her. What you care who holdin on to who? She nice girl, company for Denver. Theres something funny about that gal. Act sick, sound sick, but she dont look sick. Eats sweets all day long, as strong as a bull. She not strong. She cant hardly even walk without holdin on to somethin. Cant walk, but I seen her pick up the rocker with one hand. You aint seen no such a-thing. Hey, dont tell me. Ask Denver. She right there with her. Sethe, Sethe, baby. We were startin to feel a little like a family ourself till she come along. - Is that what got your teeth on edge? - Its a feelin in me. - I cant place it. Its her. - You wanna feel somethin? Feel what it feel like to be a coloured woman roamin the roads. And anything God made liable to jump on you. Feel that! I know every bit of that, Sethe. I wasnt born yesterday, and I never mistreated a woman in my life. Well, that makes one of you in this world. One. Not two? No, not two. Whatd Halle ever do to you? Halle stood by you. Halle ran off. He left me, and he left our children. - You dont know that. - Who he leave then if he didnt leave me? He wasnt there. He wasnt where he said he was gonna be. I had to pack my babies off ahead of me on their own. Stayed behind to look for him. Got caught by Schoolteacher and his boys for my trouble. [ Dishes Clattering ] He couldnt get out the... loft, I expect. Loft? What loft? One in the barn, I reckon. He was there? How do you know? Mornin after you run, I seen Halle... chained to a post. I said, What happened? Where you been? The loft, the loft. The loft. Thats all he said. - Could never figure out what he meant by that. - [ Sighing ] He saw them boys do that to me? And he let them keep on breathin? I- I ask him... How come you didnt run with Sethe? He never answered me. I seen him once more, the day Schoolteacher sold me to Brandywine. Takin me away in the wagon. There Halle was, in the yard... sittin by the churn. They didnt need to put no chains on him no more. His mind was gone. Sethe... a man aint a goddam axe... choppin and hackin... bustin every minute of the day. Things get to him. Things he cant chop down cause they inside. Halle never just run off and leave you, Sethe. You see... you the only one of us who made it out that night. The only one. [ Thunder Rumbling ] I didnt plan on telling you all that. Im sorry. I didnt plan on hearin it. Didnt plan on you walkin down that road neither... comin into my house... bringin all this with you. [ Denver Humming ] [ Denver Giggling ] - Whered you learn to dance? - Nowhere! Watch me do this. Ohh! [ Laughing ] Now you! Come on! You may as well. Just go on! [ Laughing ] [ Screaming ] [ Groaning, Sighing ] Why you call yourself Beloved? In the dark, my name Beloved. Whats it like where you was before? Can you tell me? Dark. I was small in that place... like this here. - Were you cold? - Hot! Nothing to breathe down there. No room to move. You see anybody? Its a lot of people... down there. Some is dead. You see Jesus? Baby Suggs? I dont know. I dont know the names. Well, what you come back here for? To see her face. Mamas? Sethes? Sethe. I remember! I remember! I was in the water. I see her diamonds down there. Then she left me behind... by myself. Dont. You wont ever leave us, will ya? No. Never. This is where I am! Dont tell. Please dont let Mama know who you are. You hear me? Dont tell me what to do! Dont you never, never tell me what to do! - But Im on your side! - She the one! She the one l need! You can go! She the one I have to have! [ Mumbles ] Tell me how Sethe... make you in the boat. Tell me. She never told me all of it. Tell me. Denver. Tell me. [ Crying ] Well-- Mama was runnin! - [ Bird Squawking ] - [ Sethe Panting ] [ Screaming ] [ Moaning ] [ Moaning Continues ] Who in there? Who that back there? [ Panting ] [ Chuckling ] My, my, my. My, my, my, my! Its a nigger! If that dont beat all! Girl, you about the scariest-lookin somethin I ever saw. What you doin way back up here? Im runnin.

Oh, my! I expect this baby there is gonna die in these wild onions. I gotta eat me somethin. W- W-Where-Where was you on your way to-to, miss? Boston. Get me some velvet. Its a store called Wilsons. They just have the purtiest velvet. You ever seen velvet or touched it? I- If-- If I did, I didnt know it. Velvet I seen was brown... but in Boston, they got all colours. What they call you? L- Lu. [ Nervously Chuckling ] Well, what you gonna do, Lu? You just gonna lay here and foal? I-- I-I cant get up. I- I cant move. Oh, sure, you can, Lu. Come on. You stay here, the snakes might get ya. - I cant. - Come on, come on. - Come on, come on. Come on. - [ Groaning ] Come on! I was fishin off the Beaver once when a nigger floated right by me. I dont like drowned people much. Do you? Your feet kinda reminded me of him. All swoll-like. - Now this is gonna hurt a little. - [ Groaning ] Anything dead comin back to life hurts. You aint got no business pokin round these hills, miss. Lookit here whos talkin. Aint nobody after me, but I know somebody after you... and they catch you, theyre gonna cut your head off. - Stop wiggling, girl. - My back hurt me. - Your back? - Yeah. Girl, you a mess. Turn over here and let me see. [ Groaning ] [ Screaming, Moaning ] Come here. Jesus! Its a tree, Lu. Your back got a whole tree on it. Chokecherry tree in bloom. See? Heres the trunk. Its spread and split wide open, full of sap and branches. And darned if these aint blossoms. Come on, girl. [ Gasping ] Cause of me, youre up and walkin. See, Jesus. Lu made it through.

Real pretty. Shh. [ Denver Narrating ] So Amy Denver, she left me and Mama on the riverbank. That was the first time we met Stamp Paid. [ Denver Crying ] Hey there. You headin across? Yes, sir. Anybody know you comin? Yes, sir. My mother-in-law, Baby Suggs. [ Crying Continues ] [ Denver Narrating ] Most folk call her Baby Suggs Holy. - To me, she were Grandma Baby. - [ Laughing ] Thank you, Ella. Thank you, Stamp. [ Laughing ] Oh! [ Laughing Continues ] Oh, my Lord. My sweet Jesus! Thank you! - [ Baby Suggs Laughing ] - [ Sethe Crying ] Wheres my Halle? Well, he w-wasnt there... where he said to meet him, and I had to go.

Pretty, huh? Daddy come soon, huh? No matter what happen... God has led you home. So... lay em down, Sethe. Sword and shield. Study war no more. God has led you home. - Where we goin, Mama? - We goin to pay tribute to your daddy. Our house used to be a whole different thing. Strangers rested there. People leavin messages. Folks comin and goin all the time. It was a happy house when I first got there with Denver strapped to my chest... waitin on her daddy to come. Daddy. Halle bought Baby Suggs freedom... but slavery done already busted her legs... and busted her back, hands, everything. When she come here, she aint had nothin left to make no livin with... besides her heart. Baby Suggs used to preach right here. Let the children come. - [ Laughing ] - [ Footsteps ] Let your mothers hear you laugh. [ Children Laughing ] Let the grown men come. Let your wives and your children... see you dance. [ Crowd Cheering, Chattering ] Women! Women! I want you to weep! Just weep... for the living... for the dead. Weep. Grandma Baby used to say your daddy was too good for this world. Remember? He was a good man. It scared her. She used to always fret whether he wasnt gonna make it through nothin. He made it through a lot. Maybe Grandma Baby was right.

But it was more than that. I was-- I was big... and wide, Paul. So wide, when I stretched out my arms, all my children could get in between. Looked like I-- Looked like I loved em more after we got here. [ Chuckles ] Maybe I just knew that long as we was in Kentucky with Schoolteacher... they really wasnt mine to love. Look like when I jumped off that wagon... wasnt nobody in this world I couldnt love if I want to. Twenty-eight days. Twenty-eight good days of free life. Id wake up in the morning and... decide for myself what to do with the day. Sometimes I-- I hear my boys-- hear em laughin a laugh I aint never heard. First I get scared, scared somebody might hear em... and get mad. Then I remembered that if they laughed that hard till it hurt... thatd be the only hurt they have all day. And when the people would gather-- theyd come from all around to hear Baby Suggs Holy-- I seen and heard things I aint never seen before. I seen what free Negroes look like for the first time. Here in this place, we are flesh. Flesh that weeps... laughs... dances barefoot in the grass. [ Audience Murmuring Approval ] Love your flesh. Love it hard. Yonder... they do not love our flesh. [ Man ] Amen. [ Chuckling ] Oh, my people... they do not love your hands. Those... they only use... tie... bind... chop off... and leave empty. Love your hands. Raise them up... and kiss them.

Schoolteacher aint got em. - Maybe theres worse. - It aint my job to know whats worse, Paul D. Its my job to know what is and keep my children away from it, cause Id rather know... they at peace in heaven than live in a hell here on Earth, so help me, Jesus. - What you did was wrong, Sethe. - I shouldve gone back there? Took my babies back to Sweet Home? There couldve been a way. Some other way. What way, Paul D? You got two feet, Sethe, not four. You can set aside supper for me. I might be late gettin back. After all I just told you, Paul D... and after you tellin me how many feet I got... you think sayin goodbye is gonna break me into pieces? Youre a sweet man. [ Door Shutting ] So long, Paul D.
