Sage Hall, it was in the same town I grew up in. But it might as well have been in another country. Preppies. That's what they're called. They all dressed the same, looked the same. Went to all of the same places and schools. Everything about them seemed so easy, so effortless already done... because it was. That's Ingrid, my mom. That's Mike, my dad. This was her day, Ingrid's day. The day she got the letter. You got into Sage Hall. I never applied. I thought you said we didn't have the money. It's a scholarship. She decided that I needed to be sent to a place that she was sure would change everything. Change me. And it did. She was right. You didn't fill out an application. As my mom tells it, our family was one of the richest in all of Germany. But when they ended up on the wrong side of the Berlin Wall they lost everything. She's never stopped wanting it back. Before I even started at Sage, I was finished. You mom got a call from the registrar's office. They said you didn't show. No, I went. I just... I, I couldn't really find the building. And then, by the time I got there they were closed. Luckily, they agreed to let you register tomorrow. What? I'm taking you there myself. Ingrid, we're gonna discuss this as a family. This is Sage Hall. I know. Toby. How do you feel about this? I don't belong there. You don't know where you belong. Someday you'll thank me for this. You can't make me go. It had happened before, sometimes for days. A dark room and TV. And it only stopped when I had something to offer her. I'm gonna go back tomorrow. I did it for her. I did it for my dad. Stay invisible. Stay out of sight. That was the plan. That is your charge. We expect it of you. Expect it of yourselves. I ask you now to intone the Sage Hall oath Then we'll invite our newer students to make their mark in our sacred tomb. Fully aware, therefore the importance of what I'm choosing today within this... After taking an oath to the principles and values of Sage Hall, every student as tradition dictated signed their name in a book. A 200-year-old book. Shit. Look at this fucking idiot. -Hey, you okay? -Yeah. God. Alright... settle down. Hey, spilling ink is an ancient Chinese omen. I'm Fidel. That's Fidel. Hi. I'm Toby. He's from Columbia. But everyone here calls him the King of Mexico. He wanted to be friends so badly that it occurred to me that he was stuck here too. Well, my dad comes up to America a lot. He's the ambassador. What's your dad do? He's a delivery guy. I'm here on scholarship. You know, it amazes me that this place with all its nepotism and inbreeding can actually pad its endowment. Come on, let me show you around. This is Woodhull. It's where the jocks live. And that's Cleve. Boozers. This is Kennedy, it's a bunch of stoners mostly... Alexandra Hayes of the Charleston Hayes. Alex as everyone called her. Fidel let me know that I had no business looking at her or even thinking I could speak with her. Where's your dorm? -It's Griswold. -It's over here. But I couldn't stop thinking about her. Being a day student wasn't easy. I didn't live in the dorm. We were seen as someone who's just passing through. This is where I hang between classes? You can always hang out in my room, if you like. Thank you. Hey, you're, you're new, right? -Yeah. -You wanna join me for a smoke? yeah. Sure. Okay. Hold this. Thanks. Hey, I got some stuff to do. I'll catch you later, Toby. Ellis William Tynes III. He was the fourth generation of the Tynes family to attend Sage. Later I had heard that his dad was horseback riding buddies with Reagan. Thank God for the soviets, right? You know, four generations of my family had scribbled their name inside that book you thrashed. Yeah, I'm really sorry about that. I have to admit, he had charisma. Are you kiddin'? Hell, I wanted to be his friend. You should've seen what happened to the last scholarship winner. Why? What happened? Hey, have you seen the TV room yet? You know, we got a new TV which is pretty nice. We got VHS too. It's pretty sharp.... Hey. Get him! Come on, get him! Get that motherfucker! Come on! -You little filth faggot! -Motherfucker! -Turn around! -Come here, you piece of shit! Gaines is coming! Hey! Come on! Hazing, if you took it personally you got more of it, and it got worse. Fidel taught me how to blend in. The rules, their mannerisms the preppie uniform. Take it. What is this? You jerk off to this? I study it. I used to be a wet back ear too. This one too. Shit, I got econ. -One more thing. -What? You got a new nickname. Flipper. So it comes to us in the mind of one man who lived about 200 years ago and his name was Adam Smith. Anyone? Adam Smith? Welcome Toby. Hey, sorry I'm late. I was just telling everyone about our good friend here, Adam Smith. Ever heard of him? Yeah. "Wealth Of Nations." The invisible hand. What our friend Tobias is referring... Mr. Jennings was nice enough. After I fell off the stage, he seemed to take an interest in me. These markets are... Kind of like I was a project or something. Flipper. I take in my lumps. I was adapting. Observing. Putting the past behind me, until the past showed up. Dennis Carnell. My best friend. We grew up together. And he had the unique personality trait of being totally unaware of his surroundings. Ellis. What's up, man? Hey, Dennis. What the hell are you watching? It's rugby. -And what the fuck are you wearing? You look like Pat Boone. Man, what are you doing here? What am I doing here? I live like 3 blocks away, remember? My God, guys. Flipper brought his boyfriend. Look at that guy. You think they let him keep the tool belt? Yeah, Apex Tech guarantees it. You're such a dick sometimes. Shit, honey. Hey, man, you got any weed? No. Dry as a bone. Fuck! And then it happened. My God... There's a girl... What? She's got tits. She's coming over here right now. What? I will never forget the back of her hand against my neck. Keeping the tag on is definitely a statement. You might start a trend. -I'm Toby. -I know. -You do? -Yeah. We have econ together. You came in late last time and made everybody look stupid. Yeah. I'm, I'm Dennis by the way. Nice to meet you. So, do you guys by any chance happen to have any pot? On me? Right now? No. Do you? Do you know where to get some? Yeah, I-I can get it. -He's kidding. -No, fuck that. Is it just for you? And my friends. -That's a lot. Ellis can afford it. Okay, yeah, we'll, we'll let you know. Okay. We didn't have any way to get weed. But I was determined to figure out how to get it. We drove all night and all over New Haven. We searched every alley, every stoop, every corner. It wasn't looking good. We should try those guys. But you gotta make sure we're close enough so they can see us. -Okay. -Okay. I'm just gonna nod my head. Nod your head? What do you mean? I saw it in this film. They're not even looking at you, man. Just give it another second. Just roll down the fucking window, man. Yo! Air Jordan. What the fuck did you call me? We're just trying to buy some green, blood. What the fuck? What the fuck makes you think I deal drugs? -Motherfucker? -No, no, no. That's not what we were thinking. We were just... We're just looking to buy some marijuana. We thought maybe you'd know where we could get some. You're such a fuck... Shut up. Okay. You got the money? Yeah. Yeah, I have some money. Did he go with you? What's his name? Dennis. Yeah. Yeah. He came... You should've seen him. He was doing all these signals to the dealer that I-I guess he learned in some movie. He's like, "Yo, we're here to buy some green, blood." Is your friend mentally challenged? Ben and Laura were the other half of Alex and Ellis. But Laura was sweet, quiet. She was always kind to me. And Ben, her boyfriend, was a prick, but I kind of liked him anyway. Even though I was the 5th wheel, it felt good. And at the very least I was speaking and they were listening. Even if it was mostly at my expense. We're blood brothers. Stop. Toby, just stop. You're high as a fucking kite, man. Now! Let's go! Go. Go. Open up the door! I had my foot against the door that our house master Mr. Gaines was pounding on. Let's go. When she looked at me I didn't even think about it. If it had been a train coming towards her I'd have laid down in front of it. He said he was sorry. In here. You see all that in the front? Yeah, I see it. In front of the hedge there's a lot of weeds here. Just push them to the side. Make sure. What are you doing here? I heard about your suspension. I just wanted to come see you. Toby. What are you doing? Who are you talking to? She's selling Girl Scout Cookies. You want any? No, I don't want any Girl Scout Cookies. Get back to work. Yeah, no, we don't want any. My loss. I just wanted to tell you that what you did... Thank you. Welcome back. Everything felt different the day I got back from my suspension. The preppies wanted to get a look at me. They were curious. Who wouldn't be? By the time I got back to campus, I'd heard the stories. I'd blown a cloud of ganja smoke into Mr. Gaines' face pushed him out of the room and told him to fuck off. None of it was true, but it took some of the heat off me. The preppies were appeased. Hey. Can I, can I get a minute? We should go. If not, Stan and Fred will get the best eppets. Yeah, I'll be right there. Take it easy, Zorro. What's up? Listen, I-I just, I wanted to thank you for what, happened. I mean, I, look, man, I would've stuck around with you. But the thing is, I already got one strike against me and you know with the two strike rule around here... Well, discretion is often the better part of valor. Are you fucking with me? What do you mean? I mean, you're a local bumpkin and all but... sometimes sometimes I get the feeling that you're from far away. Hey, a bunch of us are, gonna meet up on the golf course after check in. You up for that? I mean, one more strike for either one of us and it's... Behind the green on the seventh hole. Midnight. Don't be a pussy. "Don't be a pussy." "Don't be a pussy." But the truth was... I wasn't afraid of anything... except losing her. I don't know, my mom said she saw on the news that like if you do this once you'll get addicted. -Your mom's a cunt. -Her mom loves you. My mom doesn't love anybody. I'm guessing, you haven't done this before. Come on, Tobs. It's not gonna hurt. -Isn't that amazing? -Look at the moon. -You feel good. -You feel really good. -I don't feel... -Laura's gonna get addicted. -No, I'm not. -You're gonna get addicted. Shut up! Something you could do every day, right? Wait, the way you talk is like... It's like perfect. It's... That's exactly how I'm feeling. Classic. Fuckin', turn that fuckin' thing off, you fuckin' moron. Why is it so hard to get? Because everybody wants it. Yeah, man, you need... You need like real... Real connections to get this shit, you know. I... I could probably get some more. From who? Y... You're bros in New Haven? Shit, Jack, they wouldn't sell you anything more than some stepped on fuckin' Tide. Those aren't my only connections. Come on, man. I mean... You'll never get your hands on good coke. If anybody can get it Toby can. Okay! Okay! So now I'm the bad guy? Pussycat! Pussycat! Come here, pussycat! -Where are you going? -I can't tell you. It's freezing! What? Don't worry. He's from Maine. You're crazy. With the balls of a polar bear! It really makes you think. You know? It makes me stop thinking. My God! I'm in love with you. I know. Where have you been? -School. -Doing what? Homework. What you... hold on. You want us to believe you were doing homework? Your hair's wet. You know, I... I'm finally making the kind of friends you guys want me to make a... and now, he's giving me a hard time. Doing what? What were you doing? I was studying! Just with some friends. That's a load of malarkey. Were you Tobias? Yeah, I said I was, alright. Stay out of my fuckin' business. Hey! Hey! What? You don't speak to your mother like that! You understand? We have every right to ask where have you've been. You just got suspended. Now, look, you can't you just can't afford this kinda trouble. Then again, we can't really afford anything. Right? No money, no connections. A pretender. A poser. That's all I was. -Hello? -Dennis, hey. Hey, man, what's goin' on? Hey, man. I need your help. He told me he'd handle it and I didn't want to know how. A good friend would've probably stopped him. But I wasn't a good friend anymore. I didn't know what I was. Shit! What happened? Next time I'll just hide the money first. You alright? Yeah, I'm okay. -Good. -Here. Thanks. What's this? It's the coke. -What? -Yeah. I stole it from 'em. Fucking pricks. Dennis! My God! Thank you so much. Yeah. God, okay... When we go in there, I need you to do something for me. Anything. Here. You just look like a badass. That's it? That's it. -Alright. -Okay, let's do it. Alright so it's about half an eight ball. Each line is a hundred bucks. Or you can do the whole thing for five hundred. Fuck you. Fuck you and your mother. You can get half an eight ball in this town for two hundred! Okay, then go get it. You see my associate here went through to make the purchase. Well, you know, I take the whole bag. No, no, no. I'll take the whole thing for $550. $600. You know, we can divide the lines. No, no... I... I'll,... I'll take the whole thing for $700. Okay, wait, hold on. Going once. Going twice. $700 to Ellis if he gives me the money. Easy, man. I mean, we're all, we're all friends here. That's okay. Yeah. Just give me the cash. It's a pleasure doing business with you Yeah, no problem. Come on, let's go. See you... Get out. This is my room. We gotta get more of this shit. So what's it like in Colombia? Where my family's from, it's beautiful. -You should come with me. -Really? Fidel was constantly talking about Colombia. Fidel, from Sage Hall. I think I told you about him invited me to go to Colombia with him... and his family. Colombia? Aren't you far away, kid? It's not a safe place to travel. So is it true there's a lot of cocaine down there? There's so much of it some people use it as currency. In the barrios, that's how it is. We don't know his family. Well, his dad's an ambassador. An ambassador? A door was open. I decided to go through it. How much is the ticket, Toby? He offered to pay for it. What would you say if we went down there try to pick up a little bit? You know, just enough to party with. You mean with Ellis and the guys. And Alex? Well, yeah and you too. You know, if we can get some. You said yourself you wanted to hang out with him. And they're all over that shit. Well, if his parents are okay with it, I... I... Yeah. We are too. We needed to raise money. A lot of it. So I started making my routes. Ellis Come in. Ben. Laura. It's my parents' donation. Alex. I'll put it to good use. Everyone put money into the first trip. We had almost $3000. I did my research on Colombia. Even stayed up late to watch a night line on the drug war. The drug cartel's had huge amounts of money weapons and influence. Journalists and politicians were killed. Kidnapping and chaos could pop off anywhere. I knew what I was walking into, but I didn't care. Honestly, I was excited. So are you gonna help me with this? I mean just tell me where I can get it. Fidel's house was pretty much a palace. Servants, bodyguards. I'd never seen anything like it. How much? Just tell me how much it is. I wanna get it, it's a gift. -For who? -For Alex. As the ambassador, Fidel's father was pretty strict about where he let us go. There were only a few tourist spots that he had thought were safe enough. He sent a bodyguard to keep an eye on every move. Welcome to Colombia. The Edge. One of Colombia's most notorious drug barrios. What do you want, gringo? Do you where I could find... cocaine? I can get you whatever you want. Okay,... Half a kilo. $3000. Yeah. Okay. You have the money? Yeah. Yeah, I got the money. Show. Show the cocaine. Show the cocaine? Okay. Okay. I'll show you the cocaine. I'll show you the cocaine. Cocaine. Right away! Where is it, gringo? Where is it? You know you should be dead right now. That was smart but not that smart. Why don't you just keep it? Or kill me? That is not my business. I am not a thief. Cocaine... That's my business. And you are Americano. I love Americano. You're full opportunities. And you made me laugh. Come. It's okay. I don't care what he wanted. He's a boy and Manuel was supposed to protect him! Look, I'm sorry. It was my fault. I went off on my own a... and then these guys just came out of nowhere and jumped me in. They took all my money and then by the time I came back Fidel and Manuel were already gone. It was a really stupid idea. I don't ever wanna lie to my parents like that again. Yeah. You left this. Talked it down to almost nothing. Thanks. Passport? Countries visited? Colombia. Purpose of your trip? Well, my friend has some family down there so we're just visiting them and seeing the country which was great. Did you buy anything you're bringing back into the states? Just this. So what did you do in Colombia? What did I do in Colombia? What did I do in Colombia? What did you do in Colombia? I... I lost my virginity. Must've been quite a trip, kid. Yeah. Thanks. The campus was empty. Not everyone was back from the long weekend yet. It was my favorite time in Sage, when the students were gone. Rather than spend another weekend with her housekeeper Alex never left. I think she liked the solitude. Hey. -I got you something. -What are you doing here? -I thought you'd like it. -Yes, it's... That's okay. You don't like it. What's wrong? I can't believe you did it. Yeah. Of course. Eighth of a key. Ever see that much? That's some midnight express shit, man. Yeah, but he didn't get caught. Well, what the fuck are we waiting for, right? I mean, I'm just gonna take a little bump, make it quick. See how it will work in with. Let's see. Here. Well... How is it? It's pure, I mean, there's, there's nothing in it. What do you mean? I mean, usually they mix this shit with lactose soap, baking soda but this This... this is... unique. Do you guys realize how many schools there are in a 20 mile radius from here? Well, you're not thinking about selling this shit. Are you? Why not? I mean, you took your share and the rest is mine. I can do what I want with it. Look, I... I'll buy the rest of it. How about that? Okay, do you have the money? Well, look man, I can't give it to you right now but I just need a little bit of time. That's what I thought. I'm sorry, man. It's just... Time's up. You know. -Fuck. -Fuck. Just a second. Just a second. It's king of Mexico. God. Yeah, tell him to come in. Hey, Fidel. You ready to party? What is it? I mean, what's it look like? Toby, Toby, where the fuck's he going, Toby? Hey. Hey, what's wrong? You made me look like an idiot. Look, I just... I never thought you'd make it through customs. I thought that this is what you wanted! You know... just hang out with all of us. You know, you can be a part of this. I don't want any part of this. I... I'm Colombian. Don't you understand? I can't just be caught dealing in cocaine! Hey, hey, ssh, ssh. Just calm down, okay. What, so now you're just some some kind of drug dealer? Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up. My father was right and you Americans just use people for what you want. You know it must be easier to be so self-righteous when you're as rich as a king. You never gonna have her, Toby. No matter how hard you try. She's gonna use you up and spit you out. No. No. Just... just stop. Then ask him for a loan. He's my kid brother. What do you have to be proud of? Now, you got me there. One hundred and twenty five grams. One eighth of a key. The deal I made with the Preppie's was that for rescuing my neck in Columbia I get half or 62 grams for myself. The purity of the coke I had was medical grade. Ellis was right. This shit was unique. Raoul schooled me on how to cut my share into half of Lactose to double my money. I set out to make $50 a gram or about $6000 total. Word spread fast. And the orders came rolling in. I had a kid from every team playing away games spread the word last weekend. So that's six schools. Look, man, I don't know why he's going through all this trouble I mean, I... I've got the money. I'll just buy it all myself. Hey, I know a place where you can get double what Ellis can pay. But the harder I work the more I live. A bunch of whacked up writers throw some kinkfests over in Litchfield. I deal them hash, but when I told them about your coke they said they'd pay anything. I think the guys, like, a Baron or something. I've always wanted to meet royalty. Is possible before handing it on to future generations. I'd wanted to become like them. But in the process I'd become something even better. I was ready a drug dealer. I exerted a level of control over them but I'd never even panicked. I didn't need an invite to any of their parties. I was the party. This is the, kid I told you about. Chuck here tells me that you've got some of the finest flake in the Northern Hemisphere. How is that even possible? How about you show me the money and I'll show you how. A tooth full first perhaps. Someone's been abroad. How much do you want? I'll take whatever you got. Come through to the lounge. I'll attend to your money. Toby? So what are you gonna do? I like you, Toby. You're very smart. And you seem like a good person. So listen closely. You need to be careful. Very, very careful. Because if this thing goes wrong... you won't have the same out as anyone else involved. Do you understand? Yeah. You and I never saw each other. We never saw each other. That was fine with me. I was sure in his mind he thought that was the end of it. But I was determined to sell it all. And do that little ride I could before. Dearest Ingrid, please accept this with a humble request that you not let Mike know I've sent this money along. Deepest regards, your brother-in-law Todd Hammel. This is the last of it. Where are you coming from? English Lit. Had to recite a poem in front of the class. -Can I hear it? -No. Please? I really wanna hear it. -No, you don't. No. -Come on. You have it memorized, right? Let's do it. I'm listening. This is your stage. God... "When I have fears that I may cease to be "before my pen has gleaned my teaming brain "before high-piled books on charactery hold like "rich garners the full ripened grain. "When I behold upon the night's starred face "huge cloudy symbols of a high romance and think that "I may never live to trace their shadows "with the magic hand of chance. " When I feel fair creature of an hour "that I may never look upon thee more "never have relish in the faery power of unreflecting love "then on the shore of the wide world I stand alone and think from love and fame to nothingness do sink." That was good. I'm serious. A bunch of us are going to Ellis' place in the city next weekend. They have a place on, on 5th Ave. His parents are just cool with that? Yeah, his parents give even less of a shit than my parents do. You know, if you got more coke, Ellis might let you come. Yeah, I can get more. How? I just go back. Think you guys can figure out a way to cover for me? Yeah. That's easy. Ellis has this whole system for how to change the attendance sheets. Okay. Yeah, I can be back in... 36 hours. You're a mad genius, Hammel. You know that? When everybody heard that I was going back to Columbia students crowded into the day lounge placing orders. At one point, there were so many I had to make them form a line. Will you at least be in a tent? Yeah, I mean, it's a ropes course. It's not boot camp. -Good luck. -Thank you. -Bye. -Bye. My mom thought I had to go on a leadership retreat. Careful. But the truth was I had 36 hours to catch a flight to Columbia, arrange a meeting with Raoul make that buy and get back to Sage Hall before the end of the weekend. All the while making sure to avoid being robbed beaten or killed. -It's for you. -Thanks. Hola, Raoul. I wanna see Raoul. You... Hey, lets have some fun before we do business. Si? You like this place? It's like New York City. Si? Si. Yeah, yeah. Wait until you see what I got lined up for tomorrow night. Well, actually I have to leave tomorrow. Why? 'Cause I have school. Wanna do a line? I'm going with you. You've done this before, right? You have girlfriend? Yes. Yeah. There is a girlfriend. She blonde or brunette? One. La rubia. -What's la rubia? -Blonde. Yeah, la rubia. Okay. Yes. -Good? -Yeah. Talk to me about this girlfriend of yours. -Well, she's never really my girlfriend. -Why? We got to this school with a bunch of really rich she's really rich and, I don't... I don't have a lot of money. My family doesn't have a lot of money. So? So I feel like, maybe there's some other guys at school they could, like, afford lot of stuff and support her like, more that I could. I couldn't stop talking. You will be rich. What do you... What do you mean? I think I've said too much. Man. Raoul gave me cocaine. Didn't even count my money. It wasn't like in the movies where a bunch of guys sit around with guns glaring at each other. It was a simple transaction. Raoul made it kind of fun. So Ricardo's most famous idea was his theory of comparative advantage. He believed that if every nation specialized in the production of the goods it had a cost advantage in producing then trade between nations would be at it's most efficient. Now, can anyone of you think of examples? Sarah? -Wine from France? -Good try. But I don't think they have a cost advantage anymore. -Timothy? -Electronics from Japan? Good one. Alice? Cocaine from Colombia. Just shut up. Alright, everybody settle down. Shit. We're cool. Should we go? A friend showed me this place, couple of years back. Fake IDs, man, and they make 'em good. -Yeah! -So you're Charles Nobbs. John Heliton... So all good? Yeah. You know, you're a genius, Hammel. An absolutely mad... Come on... -Come on. -Genius. Does it taste good? It taste delicious. -Hey. -Delicious. Delicious. Delicious. The finest four star restaurant. Hey, how are you doin'? What? What are you doing, man? You're just so goddamn comfortable? Yeah, of course. Yeah. Get up here. -What man? -You're just so goddamn comfortable? And so are you, aren't you? What's up, man? Trying to make a fucking play? Is that what you're trying to do, make a fucking play? -Why? What are you talking about? -Fuck you, Hammel, okay? I've been seeing this. I've been seeing this goddamn... Stop fuckin' pawin' on him like he's you're goddamn whore. You fucking love me. You fucking love me for a long time. Don't fucking act like... Hey, hey, stop. What the fuck are you talking about? I'm talking about the dancing. I'm talking about the smiling, the singing. All the perfect package, sort of thing to do, right? Yeah. -Is that what you trying to fucking do? -Yeah? -Why are you being like this? What do you mean? Why am I being like this? How about just having fun, man. Come on, yeah. We're just having a good time. -We're having a good time... -Don't be... Don't make it weird. I'm not making it weird. You know what? You're right. Let's all just have fun. Fuck each other, act like a bunch of fucking animal. -What are you talking about? -I have fucking respect. Right, right, right? Yeah! Yeah. Let's have a fucking ball. Yes. Let's have a fucking good time. Right. Just havin' fun! Yeah. -Right? -Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna have a great time. We're gonna have a great time. -Great time. -Great time. -Whoo! -Let's all have some fun. -Fucking fun? -What are you doing? I'm having some fun! What are you doing, man? Stop! Alex. Look... Ellis, what the fuck is wrong with you? Calm the fuck down! Calm down! You could have killed somebody. Don't you hit me, okay? You don't have that right. Don't hit me. -Hey, hey. -Hey, hey, hey. What the fuck, man? Hey! Stop. -Don't fucking try... -Calm the fuck down. Calm the fuck down, okay? Jesus Christ. It's alright. Fuck. Just calm the fuck down. Hey, man, I'm just trying to have some fun. Come on. I didn't... I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. I was... I was just... I just want us to have some fun. I'm sorry. I don't wanna lose you. I know. I know. I know. Don't be scared of me. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry... for everything. -Are you okay? -Yeah. Are you sure? It happens. -You're okay. -I know. I better go look after Ellis, okay? -You want me to come with you? -No. No. Okay. Not fun. We have enough. Fuck you. God, you can be such a fucking prick! I'm such a fucking idiot. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I realized that I had nothing. All I have was my coke and suddenly I was nothing more than a servant to a bunch of sad, rich orphans. I was wondering if you could hook me up this weekend. I've got money. -Not here, man. -Come on. I'm not kidding. Not here. It's okay. Toby. Toby. Fuck! Shit. I can't. I can't. Come on. You're not looking so hard, Toby. I was been fighting this cold. I mean, you look strung out. We need to get more. I don't think Philip is up for the task, you know? Then, why don't you get it? How the fuck am I supposed to do that? Go to Columbia and buy it, just like Toby did. You've been traveling to Columbia, is that where you getting it? Why? You want some more? -No, I want this to stop now! -Yeah? Yes. Okay, dad. I wanna know how big this is. How many people know? You could go with him. Are you insane? Do you think I'm wanna go to Columbia with Toby? Well, that'd be a ball of fun. Maybe I will. You're such a fucking hypocrite, man. You are going to go to prison. And you'll be the only one. Do... do have any idea that your life will be completely destroyed if you got caught? But you're okay with Toby risking his life 'cause he's the mule, right? -Toby, you're gonna stop. -Don't fucking touch me! Don't fucking touch me! Leave me alone. I don't care... if he is the fucking... You're not goin'. Whatever you say. Mr. Jennings didn't wait to see how big it was. He packed up and resigned. I wasn't his project I was his liability. The school infirmary said I was having a panic attack and called my mother. I'd never been so happy to see Ingrid. Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. -And you are? -I'm Alex. It's really nice to meet you, Mrs. Hammel. Did you mention it to her yet? Mentioned what? Don't worry, we're not getting married. -She's joking. -You could do a lot worse. Well, that's really nice of you, Mrs. Hammel. Thank you. You must be so proud of Toby. He's pretty much taken over a Sage Hall. Yeah. We'll see you tomorrow, Alex. Toby want's to ask if he can join me in Palm Beach for Thanksgiving. Palm Beach? No, I'm gonna be home. I'm gonna be home for Thanksgiving. See my dad really wants to meet him and all the Thurmond kids are gonna be there so it'll be really fun. The Thurmond? -Storm Thurmond, the senator of South Carolina. He and daddy are really close. Thank you, Alex, but I just... I don't... I don't feel like making any... any trips... right now. I gotta lot of homework to do. Four files are coming up and... Why don't I talk to Toby's father about it? But, you know, the expensive, it probably makes it out of the question. Don't worry. The tickets are totally free. Daddy has more frequent-flyer miles that he knows what to do with. It was really lovely to meet you. You too. -Bye. -Bye. What? Florida, Palm Beach. She wanted me to go. She encouraged it. She even used the money that I send her to buy me a gift for the trip. Mom, you can't afford this. Yes, I can. Go, be with her. Enjoy yourself. I meant to call. I can buy another room and get us the honeymoon suite. She was fucking with me. Alex toyed with me people... but I didn't care. Thanks. Play me something. -Seriously? -Yeah. I'm not very good. Come on. What's that? It's a song. Really? That's why we're the dealers. It's in that room. I can't. Yes. Hi. In two hours? Okay. Yeah, yeah, I'm ready. Where do they want to meet us? Us? Raoul wanted me to meet him at a party he ran near his place in Al Borde. Welcome. You got my money? Yeah. Do you have the stuff? Same old gringo. Well, this time you brought la rubia. You didn't tell me she was so sexy. Come. I don't walk around with three kilos. Let's have some fun. Then you're going to enjoy this party. Raoul brought us to his 24 hour party while he went off to get the coke. He said it was all there for us. Whatever we wanted. The guy who owns this place. The guy who owns this house! Where did he go? Does anyone who know. Does anyone know where Raoul went? Fuck, I have to find... What? What? What? Stop. No. No. Hey, Calista. Is, is Alex home? No, Mr. Ellis. Well, will you be expecting her home soon? No, Mr. Ellis. Why not? Where is she? She said she was spending the break with a friend. May I use your phone? Get rid of it. -What? -Right before, before we land. Go to the bathroom and get rid of it. Why? I have a terrible feeling. I don't want any part of this. We don't need it, Toby. -And what about Ellis? -What about it. Please, get rid of it. Please. That's what you want? Yes. Yes, hello, I'd like to speak to Dr. Fielding. Yes, it's Ellis Tynes. It's important. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Excuse me, I need to use the restroom. Sure. -This one? -Yeah. Ready? Are you Tobias Hammel? -Yeah. -DEA. Come with us, please. Excuse me, please tell me, what's... What's going on? Just gonna take a little look through your things. -Stay here. -What's going on? You're under arrest for the possession of narcotics. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can or will be used against you in a court of law. Toby, what's... Toby, what's going on? Let's take him. Toby! Toby! They're saying he's going to be tried as an adult. He's gonna do anything he can to get himself out of this! He's gonna rat us out, Ellis. All of us. Doesn't matter. How can you be so fucking casual about this? Don't you know that if Fielding finds out... He finds out we're in on this, we're fucked. Doesn't matter. Why not? Because, headmaster already knows. A... and how does the headmaster already know, Ellis? I covered our asses. You covered our asses? What does that mean? I told them what Toby was doing. Got the DEA involved. So it's, it's a criminal matter. It's on him. You ratted Toby out. It was you. Fuckin' scumbag. Hey, man, look... We'll get off with no more than suspensions. Okay. It's gonna be cool. What about Alex? What the fuck. My parents are gonna shit. There goes fucking Yale. You were never Yale material, Benny. -Laura. -Get away from me! -Laura. -No, leave me alone! You made it, cunt. We understand the defendant's prior lack of any record In this young age, your honor. But we believe the amount of the illegal substance ceased is significant enough... I was being charged with federal drug trafficking. Word of what I had done had spread across the country. And after "60 minutes" picked up a story it was a national scandal. Hi, Mary. I need to speak with my mom, please. Well, I don't care if she's in a meeting. I need you to go get her, I... It's really important. Hey, have you seen Laura? No one was safe now. There was nowhere to hide. Okay. Okay. Can I talk to my dad? Headmaster Fielding. Hi, I'm Ed Bradley from "60 minutes." I have a few questions for you, I'd like you to answer do you have a minute? He had no idea how many students in the schools were involved. Scope of it was overwhelming. Concerning this issue, it's under investigation. We're looking at the facts. No. No message. The press was in a frenzy. I brought the scourge of cocaine into the midst of America's most privileged progeny. The white kids were in danger. But this is a major investigation. -You have a good day. -Dr. Fielding? Dr. Fielding? Everyone was feeling. Trying to stay ahead of what was about to happen. But not everyone could outrun it. Laura disappeared for two days. Ben searched everywhere for her but he wasn't the one who found her. You fuck. You killed her! You fuck! No, this judge, he wanted to teach you a lesson. And our attorney is hopeful that after little time, he might grant bail. We'll have to put up the house to cover it. Okay. I'm sorry. You're going to have to make a full confession. You give him the names of everyone that's involved and you might be able to get some years back. Toby, did you hear me? It was me. It was all me. I bought it, I smuggled it in. I brought it to... No, stop it, stop it, right this instant. And Laura died because of me. No. Where's Alex? Alex... What? Who's Alex? It's the girl. He's asking about the girl. Okay. Her father made a deal. If she stays in South Carolina, she will not be extradited. Do you see? And difference between us and them... Enough. That's enough. The difference between us and them. She's okay? Yes, yes. I'd understood that a long time ago. I saw it. I'd measured it in grams. But I don't think Ingrid ever understood it. Why didn't you dump it? I'm sorry. I have to go. Toby. I'm sorry, mom, I have to go. No more lies, only medical grade truth now. Mike and Ingrid split up. Ingrid felt someone had to be responsible for the monster I had become. Ellis and Ben got expelled with a whole bunch of people. But Ellis' preordained path wasn't altered one bit. Ben never got over Laura and I heard he dropped out of the whole scene. It was my fault, all of it. When I look back at it, now I have this funny feeling remembering it all while it was happening. Like a dream I couldn't stop until I got to the end. Until I got caught. And I know I'm supposed to feel bad and tell everyone I'm sorry and I am for everything. But the truth is I miss it. Everything, everyone, even Ellis. I miss the moment I had with her. And that's all I'll ever have. Because I never saw Alex again. Last spring, a student at one of America's most prestigious prep schools, Choate Rosemary Hall was arrested by police at Kennedy Airport as he was returning with $300,000 worth of cocaine. There was a lot of drug use. There were... there were certain rooms where people would go to a smoke or to drink. The dorms were usually be drug dorms or not drug dorms. Or drinking dorms or not drinking dorms. I assume that you no more than I wish to be identified with the newspaper language used to invite us all spoilt preppies, too much privilege, too much cash, adolescent pawns for criminals, self-centered elites... With about twice as much money collected from even more students would once again board a plane with the cocaine hidden but this time, his luck was about to run out. We picked up the bags and started to walk towards the checkout door and immediately we were stopped by some of the badge. What did you think when they put those cuffs? I felt really destroyed. I felt completely at the mercy. I mean, five minutes before I thought I was on top of the world. And I was all set nothing ever gonna get to me. And five minutes later, I had no power.
