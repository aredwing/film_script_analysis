[ Growling ] [ Yelling In Rumanian ] [ Yelling In Rumanian ] [ Speaking Rumanian ] [ Captain ] Overboard.! Throw overboard.! [ Growling ] [ Captain ] Hurry up.! [ Yelling In Rumanian ] [ Man ] It is stuck.! Aaah! [ Yelling In Rumanian ] [ Groaning ] Aaaah! - [ Yelling In Rumanian ] - [ Growling ] [ Captain Screaming ] - [ Screaming ] - [ Laughter ] [ Screaming In Distance ] [ Thunderclap ] [ Man ] Get off!. Swales, for God's sake, give these poor wretches... some laudanum to calm their shattered nerves. They won't take nothin; Dr. Seward. - [ Seward ] Give them something.! - I can't do anything. Come on. Dr. Seward.! Where's Miss Lucy? Where's Miss Lucy to help with my baby? Mrs. Galloway, where is my daughter? Miss Lucy's in the house looking after that friend of hers. Fine time to abandon us. Swales, I'm coming down. - Swales, I'm-- I'm coming down. - All quiet, sir! Snodgrass, Shilling and Wallop.'' [ Door Flies Open ] Oh! Oh, Lord! Quick! Oh! Is it all right? [ Thunderclap ] Yes, yes. You're so much braver than I am, taking on all those men. But don't you think we ought to have some say on things? After all-- [ Together] We are not chattels. I know we're not. Miss Lucy. Your father says he needs you in the wards right away. Yes, I'm coming. Do you have to go now, Lucy? Yes. Into bed with you. Here we go. Thank you. Now, remember, Mina, if you don't rest, you'll be stuck in this bedroom all winter. You're right. You go down. I'll be fine. Good night. Good night. [ Wind Howling, Thunderclap ] Lucy, we've got our work cut out. I'm sorry, Papa, Mina isn't feeling at all well tonight. I know she's our friend, but, really, Mina's never feeling very well. That's not fair. We invited her here for her health, and we have to look after her. Oh, Annie, don't worry. I'll take him. Let me take him, darling. There we are. Oh, it can't be as bad as that. [ Crying ] Bells! What? Bells? Hollow bells! Listen! Sunken bells. Sunken bells. Are you mad, Swales? It's just the church bells to warn the ships, that's all. [ Bells Tolling ] [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Growling ] [ Howls ] [ Growls ] [ Man ] Right again. Little bit more. Come on,you two. Get your hands out of your pockets. No, no, no.! Keep them bits of timber separate. Tell them women to get out of the way if they're not helpin; [ Woman ] It's freezin; isn't it? It's freezin.! Come on, my son. Grab hold. It'll give our mum some tidy frocks, won't it, Dad? [ Man ] Hey, watch that boom.! It'll knock your bloody head off. Not likely. The thing about these wrecks-- [ Chattering ] [ Woman #1 ] Hey.! What is that? [ Woman #2 ] Look at that contraption. [ Man ] There's beds and stuff. [ Man Continues Talking, Indistinct ] [ Woman #1 ] Good morning, sir. - Fancy. - That he is! Fancy. No one allowed on board. I've got business. What sort of business? I'm a solicitor, Jonathan Harker, and I've been on the road all night from London. Jonathan.! - It's all right. Let him pass. - Right. Carry on. What the devil are you doing here? Our firm was telegraphed yesterday that this ship had been sighted a week early. Oh, God. The man we represented in the purchase of Carfax Abbey, Count Dracula-- Count Dracula, of course! I almost forgot. Is he safe? Who? Dracula. Oh, yes. He's the only one who is. Young Mina found him on the beach last night, and we took him to Carfax. As for the rest of the crew-- Look. [ Flies Buzzing ] [Jonathan ] What happened? We don't know. Maybe the ship's log will tell us. [ Man ] All right, swing 'em across, Harry. Excuse me. Is all this cargo the count's? There's more down below, but the rest broke up on them rocks. Filled up with some kind of dirt. Dirt? What for? Whichever it is, I'll take it. You can't do that, Renfield. The count's not here to sign for them. They stay here 'til he comes around himself!. I'm sorry, but the rights of the ship owner are already sacrificed... since the tiller of this vessel is held in a dead hand. Where's the rest of Dracula's baggage? I'd like to inspect that as well. - Come this way. - Harker, you sold me house right out from under me, and you sold that poor count a right bill of goods with your fancy silver tongue. I've half a mind to tell Dracula he been took good. I wonder if I could impose upon you to ask the count when he rises... if he would join us for dinner at Billerbeck Hall. - What, at the looney bin? - At my home, Mr. Renfield. Come. I'll give him the message, but I don't think he'll be in the mood for any fancy socializin'. [ Man ] Go back. Go back a little bit more. [ Snorts ] [ Man ] Good morning, ma'am. [ Moos ] Jonathan! Thank God you're here! We've had the most-- There, there! That's enough of that. Save that 'til after you're married. I can't tell you how dreadful it's been. Slow down, Lucy. Slow down. I had to come to meet your new neighbor. It was terrifying. Mina found him washed up on the beach. It's a miracle he's not dead. You look lovely. I look dreadful. I haven't been to bed all night. [ Chuckles ] [ Crows Cawing ] [ Grunting ] [ Grunting, Laughing ] Now for the stairs. [ Hinges Creaking ] This is the last one. And lucky for you 'cause I'm not a bloody machine. - [ Animal Screeching ] - [ Gasps ] [ Screeching Continues ] [ Yells ] [ Seward ] Pushed along by the storm, no doubt. No storm could have caused that captain's throat wound. I've never seen anything so ghastly! Oh, please. Not before dinner. Sorry. And, Dr. Seward, that wolf or dog or whatever it was-- Oh, a dog, I'm sure. Probably the ship's mascot. Early this morning that big dog belonging to the dustman were found dead as a doornail. Had its throat torn away. - Tore away? - Aye. By some savage claw they say. Count Dracula. Good evening. Miss Seward. Good evening, Count. Dr. Seward. Miss Van Helsing! My savior. I trust you're feeling improved. Oh, yes. Thank you. I don't think she looks well at all. Well, perhaps a trifle pale. Count Dracula, we haven't actually met. - Uh, this is-- - Yes,Jonathan Harker, my new English solicitor. I have enjoyed our correspondence. And I, too, I must say. I must thank you for finding me an extraordinary house here in Whitby. [ Laughing ] [Jonathan ] It's a pleasure. I'm sorry, but I don't see how anyone, except possibly Milo Renfield, could spend even a day at Carfax Abbey. A house, Miss Seward, cannot be made habitable in a day. And after all, how few days go to make up a century. Sorry, I don't understand. I'm of an old family. To live in a new house would be impossible for me. I got dinner hot, if anybody cares. I care, Mr. Swales. Come on, Lucy. Come along, Count. Food. Miss Van Helsing. It is diffiicult for me to express precisely, but there seemed to be a doom over the ship from the moment we left Varna. Count, uh, some wine-- No, thank you, Doctor. I never drink wine. Before you arrived, we were looking at the ship's log. It wasn't lost at sea? No. The very last entry was a strange word: Undead? Yes, uh, nosferatu. Ah! It means not dead. You were right. No, with your permission and all due respect to Miss Van Helsing-- Yes, I'm quite finished, thank you-- there is a distinction: The words not dead-- [ Swales ] Damn.! carry the simple meaning-- Agh! Dead, undead. I don't care. They all frighten me. Oh, I love to be frightened. Do you? This is written in an obscure regional dialect. The captain was a Magyar; I am Szekler. Unfortunately I can't translate it for you. Magyar. [ Chuckles ] Szekler. I had no idea, Count, that your country was so complex. Oh,yes, Doctor. It's very, very complex. [ Mina ] More coffee? [ Seward ] Mmm. So, you've come to England, Count, to settle down? To settle down? No, hardly that. I've come to wander through the crowded streets of London... or to be here in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity. To share its life, its change, its death. You, uh-- You have a great lust for life, Count. How well you phrase it. [ Gasps ] [ Swales ] Miss Van Helsing! Oh! [ Gasping ] I'm all right. I'm just dizzy. Swales, get the laudanum. No.! No drugs. You must not pollute her blood. Put her here on the couch. Mmm. Oh. [ Gasping ] Forgive me, Doctor. You see, in my country we are a simpler people. The strain of the last day has been too much for you, Miss Van Helsing. And I am the cause, I fear. No, no. It's just-- It's just this pain in my head. It runs down here into my neck. I can remove this pain. - So can I. Swales, get my-- - No. Such pains yield readily to suggestion. If you mean hypnotism, she'd be better offhaving the pain. - Why? - I suspect Mr. Harker... thinks of some ugly waving of arms. That is not my method. Look at me. When I will you to do a thing, it shall be done. Hear and obey. From now on, you have no pain. -And no will ofher own either. - Lucy.! I admire your candor, Miss Seward. Precisely the sort of stimulating encounter I'd hoped to find here in England. [Jonathan ] Indeed. Yes, indeed. I despise women with no life in them. No blood. When you awake, you will remember nothing. Good Lord! Was it something that I said? [ Dracula ] Now, Mr. Harker, come. We must talk seriously. I want to sign the deed to my new home here in England. Of course. Tonight? I won't hear of it. This was meant to be a party to welcome our new neighbor. Come, Count. Come and dance with me. - But I hardly know-- - It doesn't matter. I'll teach you. I meant... I hardly know you. Nonsense. [ Lucy Laughs ] [ Horses Neigh ] [ Horse Neighs ] [ Bell Dings ] [ Whispers ] Jonathan? Jonathan. [ Owl Hoots ] Boo! - Oh, my God,Jonathan! Don't ever do that! - Shh, shh, shh! I thought you loved to be frightened. I think I should go back to bed, Mr. Harker. Mr. Harker, is it? Looks like I'm not gonna be good enough for the likes of you anymore. Hobnobbing with royalty now, are we? Really,Jonathan. You pretend to be so utterly maudlin. We were just dancing. Just dancing! That's a right amazing way of putting it. Do you know,Jonathan, that if you go on being cross, you're going to sprout the most enormous wart... right on the end of your nose. [ Both Laughing ] [ Rattles ] [ Moans ] [ Rattling Continues ] [ Gasps ] [ Whimpers ] [ Gasps ] [ Wolf Howling ] It's nothing. [ Laughs ] It's just a dog. [ Howling Continues ] [ Door Closes In Distance ] [ Mutters ] [ Door Closes Nearer ] [ Gasps ] Bloody hell, that hurts. [ Bell Tolls ] Me bloody head. [ Mumbling ] Pump. [ Pump Squeaks ] Ah! Oh! Here we go. Here we go. Nice and fat and juicy. [ Chuckles ] [ Slurping, Crunching ] [ Yells ] Good evening. It will not open. You have nothing to fear. I'm accustomed to barring my home. There are wolves in Transylvania. Not here there ain't! You must have patience with me. You must try to understand me. I can reward you with a long and fruitful life, but I must have your loyalty. Can you give that? Then come. I been bit by a bat. Yes, I see. [ Man Chattering ] Good morning, Dad. We got back. Good morning, Burt. Morning, Billy lad. Tally ho. [ Woman ] Come now.! Mind yourself!. Mind what you're doing.! [ Bell Dings ] [ Gasping ] What is it? Mina, what's wrong? What is it? [ Gasping ] The moonlight-- The flapping-- [ Bell Ringing ] Papa! Papa, come quickly! Darling, try and tell me what's wrong. I-- I-- What is it? Papa, come quickly.! Papa, help her! What's wrong with her? She can't breathe. My-- My-- My-- My throat pains me so. I can't get any air! There's plenty. Take a deep breath. - [Jonathan ] What happened? - I don't know. Asphyxiation. Just breathe in, darling. Just breathe. Mina, breathe. [ Lucy ] Try.! Breathe. Breathe. Mina, breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Try, darling. - Breathe, breathe, breathe! - I can't breathe! - Oh, Papa, stop it! Breathe! Oh, Father, be careful.! Mina, Mina. [ Gasping ] Oh, Papa. Breathe, breathe. [ Gasping ] Try, darling. Breathe. Breathe. [ Gasping ] [ Choking ] Oh, my God, Papa. She's dead. [ Sobbing ] Look at her throat! Two punctures. [ Gasping ] Not very large, but not wholesome. Not wholesome, Papa! What are you talking about? Jonathan, get her out of here. Jonathan, please. [ Sobbing ] Twelve Van Briggle Strasse. Amsterdam. Yes. Professor Abraham Van Helsing. Now, read the whole thing back to me like a good girl. [ Lucy ] Nothing for me, thank you. Come on. You need your strength. I should never have left her alone. That's preposterous.! You had no way ofknowing. Mina has died. No, not lied.! Died. Telegraph or come at once. Your dear friend in this saddest of occasions, Jack Seward. Yes. Well, I do hope the professor gets it. The poor, poor man. Poor Mina. Do you think it was her heart, Doctor? Or that pain in her head? I don't know. It's so long since I've practiced real medicine. - What do you think killed her? - Killed her? That's an odd word. Yet there was no sign of disease. What about those marks on her neck? Marks on her neck. Hmm. Perhaps she injured herself fastening her shawl. Oh, Father! Don't be absurd. You saw those wounds! [ Door Knocker Banging ] [ Squeaking ] [ Wings Flapping ] Hello? [ Insect Buzzing ] Hello? [ Buzzing Continues ] [ Wings Flapping ] Is anyone at home? Hello? Count Dracula! You needn't shout, Mr. Harker. You frightened me. I'm sorry. I had a key. I had to let myself in. I wonder where Renfield can be? I don't know. I knocked, but-- Yes, well, the man is worthless. It doesn't matter. At any rate, you are here. Come up. Thank you. [ Bell Tolls ] [ Tolling Continues ] - Hello. - Good evening. I'm sorry to hear of Miss Van Helsing's death. You know already? Yes. News of death travels fast. She was very ill. I could tell last night when I looked into her eyes. She'd been frail all her life. Oh, your key. I only had it to inspect the property. Yes, of course. Have you brought the original deed? Here. If you'd like to sign at the bottom. And some customs documents for your crates. Now, I didn't know what to say of their contents. Soil. Soil? Just plain dirt. Transylvanian earth. I have a keen interest in botany. Can you drive to London at once to record the deed? No. Tomorrow I must stay with Lucy for the funeral. Oh, yes. Of course. She's taking it-- Not well. She blames herself. She was with me when Mina was taken ill. I see. Then you and Miss Seward will marry? Yeah, I suppose so. If I can ever persuade her to settle down long enough. Yes. She is stronger than most women, isn't she? Yes, she is. I must be getting back. Mr. Harker, would you deliver this letter to Dr. Seward? Of course. I should like to offer his daughter and he the hospitality of my home after the funeral. You're welcome, of course, but you are leaving, are you not? - Good evening. - Good evening. [ Yells ] I want you to help me! Take me away from the cursed place. [ Muffled Protesting ] You've got to help me! You've got to help me! You've got to save me! You've got to save me! Oh, please! You've got to help me! Help me get away! [ Bat Crying ] [ Crying ] [ Inmates Shouting, Indistinct ] [ Renfield Moaning ] We need to get him to Mr. Swales. Come on! Come on! [ Swales ] Hold the door. [ Renfield ] Let me go! Please. Get in! Go on! The stench in here! Don't you ever clean it out, Swales? [ Swales ] Hold him.! Hold him there. The master's angry. He promised me lives! Not little ones. Agh! Flies and spiders. But big ones: human lives. [ Sobbing ] [Jonathan ] I don't see why not. It will do you no good to stay around here feeling sorry for yourself-- feeling guilty for no reason. You don't understand, Jonathan. I don't want to feel happy, to feel silly. Not now. Then I'll come back tomorrow night. You needn't. I can manage. Can you? Jonathan, let's not part enemies. [ Scoffs ] We're not enemies. Lucy. Oh, Lucy. Mina's father, uh, Professor Van Helsing, is arriving from Paris this evening, and we shall have to meet him. I'm afraid we shall be unable to take advantage of Count Dracula's invitation to dinner. Invitation to dinner? You didn't tell me-- Didn't I? It doesn't matter now. I'll send word around excusing us. No, I'll go! Go? I should thought-- As a courtesy. He's sending a carriage around at 8:00. So, if you, uh-- [ Bell Tolling ] [ Wolf Howling ] [ Howling Continues ] [ Whistling ] [ Man ] Whitby. Whitby. This is Whitby station. This train will call at Scarborough, Bridlington and Kingston upon Hull. Ah, porter. Whitby. Whitby. There are two portmanteaux in there. ...will call at Scarborough, Bridlington and Kingston upon Hull. Abraham! Abraham. Ab-- In my own house. How can I ever-- What happened? What in God's name could have happened? I don't know. I don't know. Jack, you must explain to me. I insist. From the beginning. As patiently as you can. I am baffled. [ Horse Snorts ] [ Horse Neighs ] [ Door Opens ] [ Hinges Creaking ] Hello. [ Slams ] Hello? Is anyone here? Count Dracula? Good evening. Welcome to Carfax Abbey, Miss Seward. Thank you. I regret Mr. Harker and your father were unable tojoin us. Let me see to your comfort. Of course you examined her with great care. There were no functional causes. None. She'd been nervous, certainly-- sleepwalking-- Sleepwalking? Nightmares. I prescribed laudanum. What? Laudanum? For nervous prostration. But a great loss of blood. How? Mina was so young. So are you. Tonight I feel positively ancient. There are worse things than death. You must believe me. If there are, I can't imagine them. I have buried many friends, and I, too, am weary. I am the last of my kind-- descended from a conquering race. My family was its heart's blood, its brains, its swords. But the warlike days are over. It is not healthy to live in the past. No, it isn't. Jonathan Harker tells me you speak some Rumanian. Well, hardly-- [ Speaking Rumanian ] There,you do understand. No, I have no idea what you said. I said it would be nice to see you smile. Then you should be pleased. Oh, I am. But I must warn you to take care. Whatever for? If at any time my company does not please you, you will have only yourself to blame, for an acquaintance who seldom forces himself... but is difficult to be rid of. [ Woman Screaming ] Murder.! She's murdered my baby. What's going on here? Stop her.! Help me! She's murdered my baby. - My God! No, Annie! - [ Annie Wailing ] Annie! No! - No, Annie.! Annie.! - Stop her! She killed him! No, Annie! Please! Please don't! [ Screaming ] [ Annie Crying ] What's happening? Two punctures directly into the aorta? [ Annie ] Shejust opened the door like she had a key.! She said, could she have my little Alex. No, no, please. Please. [ Sobbing ] She was as hot as a burning coal, and her eyes were red like rubies. And her lips all drawed back and her breath so foul. And she had these long dreadful teeth... like fangs of a wolf-- like nothing from this earth. Then she grabbed him and I grabbed her. - And the next thing I remembered, she's kneeling-- - You did not know her? Yes, I did. I did so. It was Miss Lucy's friend, Mina, that we put in the earth yesterday. [ Sobbing ] [ Wolves Howling ] Listen to them. The children of the night. What sad music they make. Do you think it's sad? So lonely. Like weeping. I think it's a wonderful sound. I really love the night. It's so simple. So deceptive. So exciting! You take the dawn for granted. The warm hot sunlight. Ah. But the night-- Was made to enjoy. Yes. Yes, it was. It was made to enjoy life... and love. Look at me. Look. You must forgive me. What for? For intruding on your life. I came of my own accord. You should perhaps go. No, I'd rather stay. It will be light soon. Not for hours yet. I will see you again. Oh, please. Abraham? Ah,Jack. Will you take some breakfast? Oh, thank you,Jackie. A little later, perhaps, if you please. Thank you. Professor, you should come inside now; it's getting very cold. I was just sitting a while with Mina. What are these? Ah! Those tiny flowers are from the garlic plant. Whatever for? Do you believe in corporeal transference? No. In materialization? No. And not in astral bodies? What is this to do with Mina? You know the legends of central Europe... of the werewolves and the vampires. Vampires? Creatures who suck the blood of the living. You aren't saying that Mina was attacked-- A creature that is dead... and yet not dead-- a thing that lives after its death... by drinking-- Oh, no! It must have blood, or it dies an agonizing death. Please stop! Miss Lucy.! I... wonder if I may? This was to be Mina's... for her birthday. She would want you to have it... and to wear it always. Always. [ Hoofbeats Approaching ] [ Hoofbeats Continue ] Good evening, Miss Seward. Good evening. I am Count Dracula. Abraham Van Helsing. Then it is your daughter, sir, who brings me here. I have come to pay my respects. What is that around your neck? This? It's a gift from Professor Van Helsing. How kind. We werejust going inside. Perhaps you'd like tojoin us. No, thank you. With your permission, sir. With my blessing. [ Snorts ] Do sit down, Professor. I'll bring you some tea. Thank you, Miss Lucy. [ Horse Neighs In Distance ] [ Neighing ] [ Neighing ] [ Wolf Howling ] Abraham, this is nonsense! This is witchcraft! This beast can tell us nothing. There are no such things as vampires. [ Growling ] [ Neighing ] [ Chimes Jingling ] [ Wolf Howling ] [ Bell Tolling ] [ Neighing ] There's nothing but the Lord's own dead out here. - I can't hold him.! - [ Neighing ] [ Van Helsing ] Let him go then. [ Neighing Continues ] What if he should break a leg? He won't. Look how alert! Hmm? You see, he knows. He will find out where lies the vampire... just as surely as you, Jack Seward, could palpate a human cancer. [ Neighs ] - [ Neighing Continues ] - Stop him.! Dear God in heaven, stop him. Now it is you, my best beloved one. You will be flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood. You shall cross land or sea... to do my bidding. I need your blood. I need... [ Moans ] [ Gasps ] Give me a wrenching iron,Jack. Hold up the cross. [ Pounding ] [ Wood Cracking ] [ Grunting ] That's not possible. I saw her put-- Body snatchers.! [ Panting ] The mines.! They run underneath the entire town everywhere. No! Abraham, please! I-I-I beg of you. Don't! [ Squeaking ] [ Chirping ] [ Owl Hooting ] - [ Screeching ] - [ Yells ] Oh.! The cross. [ Moans ] The cross! [ Squeaking ] Mina. Papa. Kom met me. We moeten samen rusten, Papa. Kom, Papa. Laat mid. Laat mid. Mid met rust.! Kom met me mee, Papa. [ Yelling ] [ Breathing Heavily ] Mina, no! [ Mina Snarling ] [ Gasping ] [ Sizzling ] [ Whimpers ] [ Screams ] [ Whimpers ] Papa. [ Sobbing ] Mr. Harker! Mrs. Galloway, I'm sorry, but is Miss Lucy-- Sound asleep. Which is where we should all be if we had more common sense. [ Chuckles ] You're right. I'll wait 'til morning to say hello. Good night. [ Chuckles, Knocks ] Lucy. It's Jonathan. Lucy. Lucy, what's the matter? Lucy! Lucy, what is it? Lucy! Come, Abraham, we need to get some-- Lucy.! Dr. Seward. Jonathan. - Thank God you're back. - Doctor, quickly. Lucy, she's so cold! Professor. She has lost a great deal of blood. There's scarcely any pulse. She'll have to be given a blood transfusion. Pray to God that one of us has her type. Swales! Swales! Take these and rub them against the inside of all doors and windows. Crush them against the glass so that the fragrance permeates the whole room... and keeps away all evil and don't forget the little room in there. Oh, good God, Professor. Not garlic. I'm sick to my stomach as it is. Are you feeling weak? No, it doesn't matter. She needs more than your blood,Jonathan. She doesn't need to breathe the odor from those plants. Do not trifle with me. There is a grim purpose in all I do. Just a little bit longer. All right. Oh! Ah, the devil. Come. Not as bad as that. I did not hear you come in, Count. I am often told I have a light footstep. I was looking in the mirror. It reflects the whole room, and yet I cannot see-- Forgive me, Doctor. I dislike mirrors. They are the playthings of man's vanity. You are a most unusual creature, Count Dracula. Yes. How is the fair patient? Her diagnosis presents difficulties. I feared it might, my friend. Would you care to see what I have prescribed for her? Anything that you prescribe for Miss Lucy has the greatest interest for me. My prescription is a most unusual one. You are a wise man, Professor, for one who has not lived even a single lifetime! You flatter me. But not wise enough to return to Holland at once, now that you have learned what you have learned. I prefer to remain. In the past 500 years, Professor, those who have crossed my path have all died... and some not pleasantly. Come here! Ah.! Your will is strong. Then I must come to you. Sacrilege. Sacrilege! [ Dracula Snarling ] [ Howls ] Abraham, the color's returning to Lucy's cheeks. Professor? Abraham, what has happened to you? Dracula has been here. What for? He came to kill me. It is he who is the vampire. Abraham, this night has been a monstrous-- He came to kill me, and now he will prey upon you. What's happening? Please, for God's sake! Will someone tell me what is happening? [Jonathan ] She looks-- Alive? [ Van Helsing ] She's the devil's undead. Nosferatu. You can't seriously expect me to believe that Count Dracula is some hideous monster? I don't expect you to believe anything... but what is. What are you gonna do? To save her soul, I must take out her heart. Heavens and earth! No! It's not your choice. She was my daughter. If we fail here, it is not merely a matter of life and death; it is that we shall become such as she. - That we and your Lucy-- - No, it's not possible! may become foul things of the night. There is work-- wild work to be done. And now... are the powers of all the devils... against us. No! [ Lucy ] Mrs. Galloway. Yes? Would you be kind enough to make me a cup of tea? I feel rather cold. No wonder! The doctor's orders were that you should stay in bed. But how he thinks I could keep you there, I don't know. [ Door Opens, Closes ] [ Sighs ] Mrs. Galloway. Good morning, Mr. Harker. Where's Lucy? Oh, she's in her room, looking much better and asking for tea. I'll get the car. [Jonathan ] Lucy, stop.! For God's sake, Lucy! Stop! What are you doing? Where are you going? Get out of my way,Jonathan. There! Now you must believe me. Lucy,you can't possibly go to him. He's no danger to me. He's a monster! A vampire! - You're fools! All of you! - No! She means to warn him. Jonathan, if you try to stop me, I shall kill myself. I charge you on your living soul, Lucy Seward, that you do not die or think of death... until this great evil which has fouled your life is true dead himself!. You dare try to confuse me.! Tormenting him who is the saddest, the kindest of all. Kind? If I could send his soul to everlasting, burning hell, I would! I despise you! All of you! Get out of my way! Lucy, no.! Let me go! Let me go! You must not go. No! Be calm. [ Whispers ] Be calm. [ Moaning ] Take her home,Jack. Watch over her. Abraham, what are you going to do? Miss Lucy's life is at stake and so is her soul. Jonathan and I must go and fiind this monster and utterly destroy it. [ Hinges Creak ] [Jonathan ] Oh, God, what a stench.! [Jonathan Groans ] Take the cross,Jonathan. Take the cross. [ Hinges Creak ] Gentlemen, how kind of you to call. I have underestimated your powers, Count Dracula, to move about in daylight hours. It is always daylight somewhere on earth, Professor. After my rest, my need is only to stay in darkness. [ Door Slams ] You fools! Do you think with your crosses and your wafers you can destroy me? Me! You do not know how many men have come against me. I am the king of my kind! You have accomplished nothing, Van Helsing. Time is on my side. In a century, when you are dust, I shall wake and call Lucy, my queen, from her grave. No! Yes. I have in my time had many brides, Mr. Harker, - but I shall set Lucy above them all. - You won't get Lucy. She's mine already. - No! - [ Screeching ] [ Grunts ] [ Screeching ] [ Grunts ] God! [ Screeching Continues ] [Jonathan ] Damn you.! [ Thud ] - [ Screeching ] - [ Screaming ] Help me, Professor! Professor.! Oh, no. [ Sighing ] [ Speaking Dutch ] [ Speaking Latin ] But I helped him. I saw that two of those crates were safely delivered from the ship. Yes, but you must not blame yourself. He probably had other coffins brought to him other ways. You know this man's cunning. Pity my poor Lucy. He's probably got them scattered all over Whitby. Then we'll find them and tear them open one by one-- In there? She can't be so ill. I couldn't help it! When she came round, she was like a wild thing. You have given her medication? Laudanum? My own daughter? Certainly not! No, please. Can I have a moment alone with her? Please, I must. I must. But, uh, remember,Jonathan. She's not what she will seem. [ Hinges Creak ] Jonathan! What happened to your face? You're frightened of me, too, aren't you? Oh, I can't bear it. I don't understand. I don't understand what's happening to me. [ Sobbing ] You seem yourself again. I've never felt so weak. Weak? You have the strength of ten men. Jonathan, can you still love me? I worship you. - [ Whispers ] I worship you. - [ Mina Laughs ] Will you tell me something? Of course. What were you doing, you and my father and the professor, in the cemetery to Mina? I can't-- I can't-- You say you love me, but you don't trust me. I would trust you with my life, my soul. Then tell me what were you doing, you and the professor, at Carfax. I only want to know if you can still love me. Oh, Lucy, please. Please. There's no need to hide your schemes and your plots from me, is there? No. Jonathan, it's no use. Whatever he wants to know, he finds out. He knows everything you think, everything you do. Lucy, stop, please! All right. All right. Stop it.! No. Don't worry. No. Lucy, please. There's nothing to be frightened of. I love you. I love you. [ Sobbing ] Please, no. Shh. [ Whispers ] I love you. I love you. I love you. No, please. I love you. [ Moans ] [ Snarls ] Aaah! Professor! Professor! [ Gasps ] Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. [ Whimpering ] [ Mina ] Oh, no. [ Gasps ] [ Sobbing ] [ Seward ] She'll sleep now. [Jonathan ] But shouldn't we stay with her? My people will look after her. You need rest. [ Renfield ] Give me them back.! Give me them back.! What? Mr. Seward, make him give me them back. - He's collecting bugs, and he's eating them alive. - Bugs? - He's disgusting.! - What do you think? You'll see disgusting when he comes. Give us a hand! - Excuse me. When who comes, please? - You know. Give me them back, you crab-faced old buzzard. You've got no blood in you anyway. And besides, I got one here that you didn't find. In the straitjacket with him. Come on! [ Renfield Protesting ] [ Seward ] Do you think Dracula will come back tonight? Of course he will. Well, we must obviously be ready. [ Wolf Howling ] [ Bell Tolling ] Evening. [ Clears Throat ] [ Muttering ] They shouldn't have tied me up like this. I would have gone quiet like a kitten. I'd like a kitten. A nice little sleek playful kitten... that I could feed you to. [ Laughs ] I'd play with him, and I'd stroke him, and I'd feed him... and feed him and feed him-- [ Crunching Sound ] Swales! Mr. Swales! Mr. Swales! He's coming to get me. He's climbing straight up the wall to get me. I'm dying and he's laughing with his red mouth and those sharp white teeth of his... like rats-- hundreds and thousands and millions of them. [ Whimpering ] Oh, God. Help my poor soul. Renfield. I'm your slave. I'm your dog, master. But please don't kill me. For the love of God, let me live. Did I not promise you... that you should come to me at your death and enjoy centuries... oflife and power over the bodies and souls of others? But I don't want human life. [ Whimpers ] You betrayed me. You sought to warn them all against me. Then punish me. Torture me. I deserve it. But please let me live. Oh, Renfield. You disappoint me so. [ Neck Cracks ] [ Patient Shrieks ] [ Loud Crash ] [ Screaming, Yelling ] [ Whistle Blowing ] [ Yelling Continues ] [ Rumbling Sound ] Oh, Miss Lucy! Miss Lucy! Dracula? Quick! Miss Seward! I've gotta have the key! The key! [Jonathan ] Hurry, Doctor. Come on.! [Jonathan ] Quickly.! [ Van Helsing ] Lucy! [ Van Helsing ] Lucy.! Lucy.! No! Come on! Where is he taking her, Abraham? Where is he taking her? [ Seward ] Go left down the lane here. Down the lane. [ Seward ] Won't this contraption go faster? [Jonathan ] It won't go any bloody faster. [ Seward, Indistinct ] Lucy, come. Come to me! No, you must go on a bit longer as a creature of the sun... only until we have left behind those who would destroy us. And then? And then you will join me on a higher plane... feeding on them. We will create more of our kind, Lucy. Which way? I know that way lies Scarborough, but I don't know. Listen. Listen! Hey! Hey! Hey there, driver. Tom Hindley, is that you? Yes, sir. It's me. Morning. - What are you doin' out here? - I had to pick up another crate... and take to the docks at Scarborough before I-- - [ Neighing ] - Whoa.! Whoa.! Look! That crate! Scarborough. The port! [Jonathan ] Then he's leaving England. [ Van Helsing ] After him.! [ Indistinct Shouting ] [Jonathan ] Hindley.! [ Van Helsing ] Pull in front ofhim. [Jonathan ] For God's sake.! Stop, man.! - Hindley! - I can't stop 'em! - What are you doing, man? - I'm doing me best! Pull over, man! Pull over. [ Tires Screeching ] Whoa! [ Tires Squealing ] - [ Man On Cart ] Watch out, you stupid ha'porth. - [ Seward ] Maniac! [ Indistinct Shouting ] Come! Come on! Whoa, Billy! Hey! Ho! Whoa, Billy! Hindley! Come on! Whoa! Hey, Billy. [Jonathan ] Hindley.! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Aah! - [ Screeching ] - [ Seward ] Look out! [ Hissing ] This thing mocks us, Abraham. If we are beaten, then there is no God. [Jonathan ] The axle's cracked. Scarborough, how far is it yet? It's ten miles! It's no use! Come on! We must try! [ Fishmonger ] Whelks.Jellied eels. All fresh today. [ Honking ] [ Fishmonger ] Get your fresh mackerel. Two bob a box. Where is it? You, sir. This wagon. You did see it arrive? The one with the big crates? [Jonathan ] Yes, where is it? It's out there... on board the Czarina Catherine bound for Rumania. - Take us to her. We'll pay you. - What? You stay here in case they are not on board. Take care. [ Ship Bell Dings ] Hey! Stop! [ Speaking Rumanian ] [ Sailor Speaking Rumanian ] [ Speaking Rumanian ] - Dracula! Where is he? - [ Speaking Rumanian ] Count Dracula is on this ship.! Nosferatu. [ Speaking Rumanian ] The cargo hold! Where is it? Come on! [ Engine Churning ] Jonathan, here. I see it. [ Hissing ] [ Mina Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] [ Mina ] No.! [ Growls ] [ Groans ] [ Growls ] [ Snarling ] [ Snarling Continues ] [ Snarling ] [ Screaming ] [ Screams ] [ Moaning ] [ Screaming ] [ Loud Flap ] [ Wolf Howling ]
