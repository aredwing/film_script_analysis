THERE'S A DIFFERENCE, ISN'T THERE? YOU KNOW... I DON'T MIND BEING ALONE, EITHER. IN FACT, I DELIBERATELY TOOK THIS JOB HERE TO GET AWAY FROM TOO MANY PEOPLE. I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU WOULDN'T BE AFRAID OF THA FOG IF YOU WENT RIGHT OUT INTO IT. I'LL SHOW YOU. IT'S LIKE THE END OF THE WORLD. IT COULD END LIKE THIS. I DON'T THINK I'D BE FRIGHTENED EVEN IF IT WERE. OR LONELY, EITHER? I KNEW YOU'D GE OVER IT OUT HERE. I WONDER WHA PEOPLE WOULD DO IF THE WORLD SHOULD END LIKE THIS. THEN THEY'D HAVE TIME TO SAY ALL THE THINGS THEY'D ALWAYS WANTED TO SAY. THEN THEY'D HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY THEM. FOR INSTANCE? HONEST THINGS. SUCH AS? SUCH AS TELLING YOU I DIDN' PARTICULARLY WANT TO PAINT EBEN. THEN WHY DID YOU GO TO ALL THAT TROUBLE? BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE YOU AGAIN. LONELY PEOPLE WANT FRIENDS, BUT THEY HAVE TO SEARCH VERY HARD FOR THEM. IT'S DIFFICUL FOR THEM TO-TO FIND... OTHER LONELY PEOPLE. THE FOG'S LIFTING. IT WASN'T THE END OF THE WORLD AFTER ALL. GOOD NIGHT, BILL. THANKS FOR BRINGING ME OVER. OH, I'LL WALK YOU HOME. OH, NO, I WOULDN' THINK OF IT. WHAT'S THE MATTER? ARE YOU ASHAMED OF ME?

MOST OF THE FELLAS I GRADUATED WITH, THEY-THEY HAVE WONDERFUL JOBS NOW, MAKING MONEY HAND OVER FIST. SOME OF THEM WERE RIBBING ME ABOUT BEING STUCK WAY OFF DOWN HERE. ONE OF THEM EVEN OFFERED ME A JOB AT 3 TIMES THE DOUGH I'M MAKING NOW. I GUESS HE FEL KIND OF SORRY FOR ME. IF HE ONLY KNEW HOW I FELT FOR HIM. YOU'VE FOUND YOUR RIGH PLACE IN THE WORLD. I ENVY YOU. YOU KNOW, YOU ARE THE FIRS PERSON THAT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT. DON'T EVER GIVE IT UP. I DON'T EVER WANT TO. COME ON. I HAVEN'T SHOWN YOU THE BEST SPOT OF ALL YET. COME ON. ALL RIGHT.

AND FOR AN ELDERLY LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER WITH A BEARD DOWN TO HIS ANKLES, YOU SPEND AN AWFULLY LONG TIME IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR. I SAW THE HUNKY DORY OFFSHORE THIS AFTERNOON. DOES THAT MEAN TOM FRAZIER'S IN TOWN? TOM'S GETTING TO BE A BIT OF A NUISANCE. YOU DIDN'T THINK SO LAST MONTH. AH! BUT THAT WAS LAST MONTH. OF COURSE, HE HAS A PERFECTLY OUT-OF- THIS-WORLD YACHT. THAT'S SOMETHING IN HIS FAVOR. HE'S A GOOD CATCH, PAT. I WOULDN'T DISCOUN HIM ENTIRELY. WANT HIM? I KNOW MY LIMITATIONS, AND I'M SATISFIED TO STAY WITHIN THEM. GO TO BED, PAT. I'M DEAD. HE MUS BE WONDERFUL. I MEANT YOUR BED. HA HA! I CAN TAKE A HINT. BUT I'LL BET $10.00 I GET IT OUT OF YOU YET. $10.00 YOU DON'T. NO WONDER I CAN'T SLEEP. SUCH A DIVINE NIGHT. FULL MOON. NO KIND OF A NIGHT TO BE STUCK IN A HOUSE BY YOURSELF. YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE OUT. IT WAS WARM ENOUGH TO GO WITHOUT YOUR COAT. PAINTING IN THE DARK, DEAR? HA HA! I WISH I'D DOUBLED THAT BET. OH, DARLING, JUST SO YOU'LL FEEL BETTER, I WILL BE SEEING TOM FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS- LUNCH ON THE YACHT AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT FROM THEN ON. NIGHT. NIGHT. GOOD MORNING. HI, BILL.

YOU HAVE ALL THE EARMARKS OF A TYPICAL BACHELOR. YOU GOT ME GOING AROUND IN CIRCLES, KATIE. IN CIRCLES? I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN EXPLAIN IT. LOOK, YOU'RE- YOU'RE A SWELL PERSON. I ALWAYS KNEW THAT, BUT, WELL, IT-IT SEEMS THA THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING LACKING. MAYBE I CAN EXPLAIN IT- EXPLAIN IT THIS WAY. IT'S LIKE YOU WERE A CAKE. A CAKE? YES, A CAKE... WITHOUT ANY FROSTING. AND I GUESS MOST GUYS, THEY KINDA LIKE THE FROSTING. KNOW WHAT I MEAN? TODAY YOU THINK I'M WELL-FROSTED. I'LL SAY. HA HA HA! WHAT ARE YOU GIGGLING ABOUT? YOUR NOT THINKING I WAS FROSTED. I WAS NEVER MORE FOOLED IN MY LIFE. KATIE, I GUESS YOU KNOW I THINK YOU'RE SOMETHING SPECIAL. I'M AFRAID I THINK YOU'RE SOMETHING SPECIAL, TOO. I'D GIVE ANYTHING FOR A CIGARETTE. YOU'RE NOT SEEING THINGS, BILL. IT'S TRUE. HELLO, BILL. I SEE YOU DID KEEP OUR DATE FOR LUNCH. IF YOU COULD ONLY SEE YOUR FACE! THAT'S VERY CLEVER. WHICH ONE OF YOU THINK THESE THINGS UP? I'M ALWAYS THE ONE. I SWEAR, KATIE, I WAS GOING TO CONFESS, BUT YOU CAME HOME A SECOND TOO SOON. WELL, IT'S LUCKY FOR YOU SHE DID. YOU WERE ABOUT TO BE KISSED BY A PERFECT STRANGER. AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S VERY EASY TO CONFUSE US. YOUR SISTER'S A VERY DANGEROUS WOMAN, KATIE. SHE COULD WORM THE SECRETS RIGHT OUT OF A SPHINX. WELL, I-I REALLY MUST BE GOING.

YOU GO ON BACK, AND I'LL-I'LL BE OUT IN A FEW MINUTES. FORGET IT- PATRICIA, BILL, EVERYTHING. THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. I KNOW THERE ISN' ANYTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT. WHAT WILL YOU DO, KATE? OH, KEEP BUSY. PAINT. NOW YOU'RE TALKING. THAT'S MY GIRL. OH, OH, KATE, DEAR? KATE, THIS IS SYLVESTER PRINGLE. MISS BOSWORTH. HOW DO YOU DO, MR. PRINGLE? THIS IS A GREAT PLEASURE. I READ YOUR COLUMN EVERY DAY. IN FACT, I'M QUITE A FAN OF YOURS. AND I AM NOW A FAN OF YOURS, MISS BOSWORTH. YOU HAVE QUITE A FLAIR FOR COLOR. A TOUCH OF ROUSSEAU? I WISH THA WERE TRUE. I'M A GREAT ADMIRER OF ROUSSEAU. EXCUSE ME FOR BREAKING IN HERE, BUT, KATE, DO YOU KNOW THAT MAN OVER THERE? NO. NOT EXACTLY THE TYPE OF ANYONE YOU EXPECT TO SEE AT A PLACE LIKE THIS. I'M GOING TO TELL HIM TO GET OUT. NO, FREDDIE. HE'S PROBABLY SOME YOUNG ART STUDENT. YES, BUT LOOK AT HIM. I WAS A STUDENT MYSELF ONCE. LET ME GO. EXCUSE ME, MR. PRINGLE. YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT. NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION. YOU BY ANY CHANCE AN ARTIST? ENOUGH OF AN ARTIST TO HAVE MY OWN OPINIONS OF THIS EXHIBITION. THEN YOU'RE A CRITIC AS WELL. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A CRITIC TO RECOGNIZE AN AMATEUR. WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE THAT SHE'S AN AMATEUR? WHO IS KIDDING WHOM? MOST OF THE PEOPLE HERE DON' SEEM TO SHARE YOUR OPINION. YOU MEAN THIS COLLECTION OF FRIENDS? HAVE YOU HEARD THE GAB THAT'S FLOATIN' AROUND HERE? "THEY'RE SO DIVINE. THEY'RE SO LOVELY." I THINK I MIGHT AS WELL TELL YOU I PAINTED THIS COLLECTION. I WAS WONDERING HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE YOU TO SAY SO. HOW DID YOU GET IN? I WALKED IN. I'M SURPRISED YOU TOOK THE TROUBLE. I WAS HUNGRY AND THIRSTY. WHAT DO YOU DO? I PAINT. WELL, THEN, YOU ARE AN ARTIST. I'VE NEVER HAD AN EXHIBITION, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DRIVING AT. I HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. IF YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? ARE YOU MAKING ME AN OFFER? I THINK I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME OF YOUR WORK TO FIND OUT WHETHER YOU'RE A PHONY OR NOT. COME ON. I'LL SHOW YOU. NOW? NOW OR NEVER. IS IT FAR? NOT IF YOU PAY FOR THE TAXI. I'LL GET MY COAT. MEET YOU OUTSIDE. WHAT'S THE MATTER, KNOCKED OUT AFTER 5 FLOORS? COME IN. DON'T WORRY. THIS IS STRICTLY ON AN INTELLECTUAL BASIS. THERE ARE SOME MORE ON THE TABLE. I'VE SEEN ENOUGH. MIGHT HAVE KNOWN YOU WOULDN'T GO FOR MY STUFF. YOUR KIND NEVER DOES. IF YOU'D STOP BEING CLASS-CONSCIOUS FOR A MINUTE, I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING. GO AHEAD. I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY. YOU MOST CERTAINLY ARE NOT A PHONY. WHAT SHALL I DO NOW? BOW FROM THE WAIST? WHAT'S YOUR NAME? KARNOCK. HAVEN'T YOU ANY OTHER NAME? ONE'S GOOD ENOUGH. IF YOU DISLIKE ME SO INTENSELY, WHY DID YOU ASK ME TO COME UP AND LOOK AT YOUR WORK? YOU ASKED ME. AND NOW THAT YOU'RE DONE WITH THE GREAT HONOR OF PRAISING MY WORK, I SUPPOSE I'LL HAVE TO START PRAISING YOURS. WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY WORK? EVERYTHING. CHIEFLY BECAUSE YOU'RE WHAT YOU ARE- STIFF, INGROWN, AFRAID. I BET YOU'RE NOT EVEN A WOMAN. I KNOW YOUR KIND. SOMEONE WAY BACK IN YOUR FAMILY WAS CLEVER ENOUGH TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY, AND THEN HIS SON MADE SOME MORE. AND THEN HIS SON HAD THE GREA PROBLEM OF LEARNING HOW TO SPEND IT. THAT'S PROBABLY BEEN GOING ON EVER SINCE. SO HERE YOU ARE, THE LAST GASP OF THE LINE- DABBLING AWAY AT BEING AN ARTIST, WITH A CAPITAL "A." WHILE SOMEONE LIKE ME, WHO'S REALLY GOT SOMETHING, CAN'T EVEN AFFORD A DECENT PAD OF DRAWING PAPER OR A PIECE OF CHALK, OR NOT TO MENTION PAINTS. WHY DID YOU SAY... I'M NOT EVEN A WOMAN? THAT ALWAYS GETS 'EM. YOU CAN CRITICIZE A WOMAN'S WORK, BUT WHEN YOU SUGGES SHE'S NOT A BALL OF FIRE, OH, BOY! WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THAT'S WHAT I MEAN. I THINK I'D BETTER BE GOING. OK. GOOD NIGHT, MR.

BOY, YOU SURE GOT A NERVE, COMING IN HERE AND TAKING OVER. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I'M GETTIN' TIRED OF YOU. YOU TALK TOO MUCH. KARNOCK, YOU'RE BEING A BIT ROUGH ON HER. YEAH. I GOT A RIGH TO MY OWN OPINION. NOT WITH THAT BRAIN, YOU HAVEN'T. I WON'T SIT FOR YOU ANOTHER MINUTE. HAVE A CIGARETTE, DIEDRA. I THINK WE ALL NEED A BREATHER. I TOLD YOU THIS WOULDN'T WORK OUT. WHO FOOLS AROUND WITH MODELS, ANYWAY? WE SHOULD HAVE GONE OU IN THE STREETS. WE SHOULD HAVE PAINTED WHAT WE SAW. IT'S NO GOOD. WE'LL HAVE TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THE POSE IS ALL WRONG. DON'T SAY THAT, KARNOCK. IT'S SO AWFULLY GOOD. I WISH I COULD DO HALF AS WELL. CUT THE COMPLIMENTS. LOOK AT THAT. JUST LOOK AT THAT. COME HERE. JUST LOOK AT THAT ARM. IT'S LIKE THE... LIKE THE TRUNK OF A TREE. THERE IS A BONE UNDER THAT FLESH. YOU'RE NOT JUST DRAWING A BUNCH OF APPLES ON A PLATTER. YOU'RE DRAWING A HUMAN BEING. IF YOU WANT TO DO A LIVING WOMAN, DO IT. I'M TRYING. YOU QUI BULLYING HER! SHUT UP! SHE WAS DOING ALL RIGH UNTIL YOU CAME HERE. I MAY BE PRESUMING TO ASK THE GREAT GENIUS A QUESTION, BUT HAVE YOU EVER SOLD ANYTHING? SCRAM. BEAT IT. GO HOME! I CAN'T GET OUT OF HERE QUICK ENOUGH TO SUIT ME. IT AIN'T YOUR FAULT, MISS BOSWORTH. KARNOCK, IT'S TIME WE SETTLED A FEW THINGS BETWEEN US. YOU'RE MOST WELCOME TO USE THIS STUDIO, YOU KNOW THAT. BUT NOT IF YOU CONTINUALLY UPSE EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY. ALL RIGHT. GO ON WITH YOUR SMUG LITTLE LIFE IF YOU WANT TO, BUT YOU CAN COUNT ME OUT. KARNOCK, STOP BEING SUCH A PIGHEADED BOOR. I'M PERFECTLY WILLING TO ALLOW YOU TO HUMILIATE ME AS REGARDS MY WORK. I WANT IT THAT WAY. BUT NOT AS A PERSON. NOR WILL I ALLOW YOU TO HUMILIATE ANYBODY ELSE AS LONG AS YOU'RE IN THIS HOUSE. OH.

I'M JUST CURIOUS TO KNOW IF THAT'S AN EYE. I KNOW IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE FOR AN EYE. IT'S GOT TO BE AN EYE. BUT IS IT? YES, IT'S AN EYE. NOW WILL YOU RUN ALONG AND HAVE YOUR TEA? WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MOOD, WE CAN GO BACK TO WORK. WELL, I GUESS THAT JUST ABOU CONFIRMS EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, FREDDIE? RUMORS HAVE BEEN CIRCULATING THAT YOU ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SORT OF A RASPUTIN OF THE PAINT POTS. THAT'S JUST ABOU THE KIND OF RUMOR I'D EXPECT SOME PEOPLE TO CIRCULATE.

OH, SURELY THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE STORE YOU'VE SEEN YOU'D LIKE? NO, NO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE YOU SURE? SURE. ALL RIGHT. I'LL TAKE IT. HOW MUCH IS IT? $69.50 WITH THE TAX. CAN I GIVE YOU A CHECK FOR IT? OF COURSE. THERE ARE SOME BLANK CHECKS ON THE DESK IN THE HALL. ALL RIGHT. WOULD YOU LIKE I WRAPPED AS A GIFT? YES, PLEASE, WILL YOU? COME ON, KATIE. YOU KNOW, I THINK SHE'S GOING TO LIKE THIS. I'M LEAVING TONIGHT. I WANT TO SURPRISE PAT AND BE HOME FOR HER BIRTHDAY. OH, BILL, HOW STUPID OF ME. I COMPLETELY FORGO I HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT. I MUST RUN ALONG. OH, BUT WOULDN'T YOU HAVE TIME FOR A DRINK BEFORE I CATCH THE TRAIN? I'M TERRIBLY SORRY. I REALLY HAVEN'T TIME. IT'S BEEN WONDERFUL SEEING YOU AGAIN, KATIE. WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU. AND THANKS A LO FOR HELPING ME OUT HERE. IT WAS FUN. GOOD-BYE, BILL. GOOD-BYE, KATIE. GIVE MY LOVE TO PAT. RIGHT. WHO IS THIS GUY EMERSON? KARNOCK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WAITING FOR YOU. USED MY CHARM ON THE COOK. SHE GOT ME SOMETHING TO EAT. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? IT'S AFTER 11:00. OH, I WENT TO A NEWSREEL THEATER, WALKED AROUND THE LAKE IN THE PARK. NO DINNER? NO. I WASN'T HUNGRY. WHERE'S THE GUY? GONE. COME OVER HERE. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. COME ON, NOW. NO GUY'S WORTH ALL THIS. WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A DRINK? NO, THANK YOU, KARNOCK. YOU KNOW... I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF THINKING ABOUT US. AND I'VE GOT I STRAIGHT AT LAST. ALL THIS ART STUFF... THAT'S BEEN A SUBSTITUTE FOR SOMETHING, HASN'T IT? YOU'LL BE GLAD TO KNOW, KARNOCK, I'VE COME TO A DECISION. I'M A THIRD-RATE ARTIST. ALWAYS WILL BE. SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO BOTHER WITH ME ANYMORE. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING. GO SOMEWHERE. HAVEN'T DECIDED. ALWAYS RUNNING AWAY. NO WONDER YOU LOST HIM. WE WON'T DISCUSS IT, KARNOCK. YOU'LL NEVER LAND A GUY, ALL CLOSED UP INSIDE LIKE THIS. BUT I WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE THIS. PEOPLE CHANGE. REMEMBER WHAT I SAID WHEN I FIRST MET YOU? THERE, IN MY ROOM? I MOST CERTAINLY DO. KIND OF WENT FOR ME THEN, DIDN'T YOU? ONLY YOU GOT COLD FEET. KARNOCK, YOUR CONCEI REALLY AMAZES ME AT TIMES. MAN NEEDS WOMAN, WOMAN NEEDS MAN. THAT'S BASIC. EVERYTHING ELSE STARTS FROM THAT-ART, MUSIC, THE WHOLE WORKS. ONLY WOMEN LIKE YOU WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING IMPORTANT OUT OF IT. YOU WANT A GUY TO STIFLE HIMSELF FOR YOU- THE GRAND PASSION AND ALL THAT BALONEY. YES, WE DO. DON'T GO FEMALE ON ME. GET WISE TO YOURSELF. OH, LEAVE ME ALONE! SURE YOU'RE NO RUNNING AWAY FROM ME NOW? REALLY! NOW, THAT'S BETTER. I'M SORRY, KARNOCK. I GUESS IT IS "THE GRAND PASSION" OR NOTHING. KARNOCK, I THINK I'M GOING TO THE ISLAND FOR A WHILE. GOOD NIGHT. HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU? 75 CENTS. YOU MAY KEEP THE CHANGE. OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO, KATIE. PAT! I THOUGH YOU WERE IN CHILE. I WASN'T ABLE TO GO. DID FREDDIE GET MY WIRE? FREDDIE'S GONE TO NEW YORK FOR A FEW WEEKS. OH. I DIDN'T KNOW. YOU LOOK TIRED, KATIE. ANYTHING WRONG? NOTHING IN PARTICULAR. OH, I READ ABOUT YOUR EXHIBITION AT THE GRUEN GALLERY. I SUPPOSE I SHOULD HAVE RUN DOWN TO SEE IT- NOT THAT I KNOW A THING ABOUT ART. I COULDN'T TELL A REMBRANDT FROM A RENOIR. KATIE, DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE SMOKING THESE DAYS? PAT, WHY COULDN'T YOU GO TO CHILE? I HAD A PERFECTLY DREADFUL COLD. SOMETHING LIKE THE FLU. WHAT A SHAME. BILL WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT YOUR GOING. BILL'S SO NAIVE ABOU A LOT OF THINGS. BUT THAT'S BILL. NAIVETE'S A BIT TRYING TO LIVE WITH ALL THE TIME. KATIE, DON'T YOU WANT TO GO UPSTAIRS? YOU HAVEN'T SAID A WORD ABOUT MY DUNGAREES. I'M GETTING TO BE A BIG OUTDOORS GIRL NOW, LEARNING TO SAIL AND ALL THAT SORT OF NONSENSE. THAT I WANT TO SEE. HA! I'LL PROVE I TO YOU. INCIDENTALLY, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OFF YOUR HAT AND STAY A WHILE? I THOUGHT WE'D SAIL OU TOWARDS DRAGONHEAD- YOUR OLD STAMPING GROUND. ANYTHING YOU SAY. YOU'RE THE SKIPPER. I'LL RAISE THE JIB. ALL RIGHT. I'LL START ON THE MAINSAIL. I'M COMING ABOUT, KATIE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF YOUR NEW SKIPPER? SHE'S ALL RIGHT. PAT, HOW'D YOU HAPPEN TO TAKE UP SAILING? YOU NEVER USED TO CARE ABOUT IT. I'D HAVE DIED OF BOREDOM OTHERWISE. GOT A BEAU, KATIE? WHATEVER POSSESSED YOU TO COME HERE, PAT? OH, I WANTED TO SEE THE GANG AGAIN. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE'VE GOT A LUNCHEON DATE ON TOM FRAZIER'S YACHT TOMORROW. IT'S A PRETTY STIFF BREEZE, PAT. CAN YOU MANAGE ALL RIGHT? OH, SURE. IT'S EXCITING! YOU'LL GET PLENTY OF EXCITEMENT. LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING INTO SOME HEAVY WEATHER. WONDERFUL. I'LL GIVE I A RUN FOR ITS MONEY! LOOK OUT, KATIE, I'M GOING TO JIBE. ALL RIGHT! IT'S GETTING REALLY NASTY, PAT! WE SHOULD GO BACK. NOT ON YOUR LIFE. HAUL IN YOUR MAINSAIL! I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SAIL IN A STORM. YOU'RE CRAZY! SO I'M CRAZY. ALL WE NEEDED WAS SOME FOG. TACK YOUR SHEET! YOU WERE RIGHT! WE SHOULD HAVE GONE BACK. TOO LATE NOW! ALL WE CAN DO IS HOPE TO GET IN THE LEE OF THE LIGHTHOUSE! WATCH YOUR HEAD! HERE COMES A BIG ONE! I SHOULD HAVE INSISTED WE GO BACK! I'LL HANDLE THE SHEETS! KATIE! WE'RE HEADED FOR THE REEFS! WELL, TURN US BACK LEEWARD! HANG ON! LOOK OUT, KATIE! THE REEFS, PAT! THE REEFS WILL RIP OU THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT! PAT! PAT! PAT! PAT! PAT! PAT! WHEN DID YOU SAY YOU FIRS NOTICED WHAT WAS HAPPENING? WELL, I WAS LISTENING TO THE RADIO. THERE WAS A TERRIBLE HIGH WIND, AND I THOUGHT I HEARD SOMEBODY HOLLERING. THEN YOU WENT TO THE WINDOW. Shh! You're raising your voices too much. ALL RIGHT, MA'AM. I LOOKED OUT, AND THERE WAS THE BOAT, HEADED FOR THE ROCKS, MAINSAIL ALL TORN TO SHREDS. Don't talk too loud. She needs all the sleep she can get. NO RIGHT TO BE OU ON A DAY LIKE THAT. THEY MUST HAVE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE SAIL LONG BEFORE IT HAPPENED. I PUT IN A CALL TO THE COAST GUARD. DID YOU SEE WHICH ONE OF THEM WAS HANDLING THE BOAT? HOW COULD I? I COULDN' TELL THEM APART ANYWAYS. TALK LOW. YES, MA'AM. WHEN YOU GOT TO THEM, WERE YOU ABLE TO SEE THE BODY OF THE OTHER ONE, OR WAS IT UNDER THE BOAT? NO, NEVER DID SEE THE BODY. AIN'T SEEN IT YET. OH, NO! THERE, THERE, NOW. EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU SHOULD KEEP VERY WARM AND QUIET. I TRIED TO PULL HER BACK. MRS. EMERSON, WE KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT. MRS. EMERSON? WHAT? I'M AN INVESTIGATOR. I'VE JUST BEEN GETTING A STATEMEN ABOUT THE WRECK FROM MR. FOLGER. HE WAS THE ONLY WITNESS. YOU'RE VERY FORTUNATE, MRS. EMERSON. IT WAS A BAD ACCIDENT. NOW, YOUR SISTER CAME UP HERE TO VISIT YOU YESTERDAY, DIDN'T SHE? AND YOU TOOK HER SAILING? SHE'S ALL CONFUSED. I THINK YOU OUGHT TO LEAVE HER BE. YEAH, MAYBE SO. MRS. EMERSON, TRY AND THINK OF MR. BILL. THINK OF HIS FEELINGS IF IT HAD BEEN YOU. YOU KNOW BILL BEST, EBEN. YOU TALK TO HER. RIGHT. JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE, MRS. EMERSON. EVER SINCE IT HAPPENED, YOU BEEN LYING HERE, CRYING FOR BILL OVER AND OVER AGAIN. YOU KEEP SAYING, "I TRIED TO SAVE HER." BILL AIN'T GOING TO BLAME YOU, MRS. EMERSON. YOU GOT TO GET THAT THROUGH YOUR HEAD. YOU GOT TO LOOK AT I THIS WAY. IF THE GOOD LORD HAD WANTED TO TAKE YOU INSTEAD OF HER, WHY, HE'D HAVE DONE IT. I WAS REAL FOND OF YOUR SISTER. GUESS I DIDN' SHOW IT MUCH, BUT I WAS. BUT BILL ALWAYS LOVED YOU, NEVER HER. MAYBE THAT'S WHY YOU WERE SPARED. THERE AIN'T NO ARGUING THE WILL OF THE LORD. SO YOU GET WELL AND STRONG NOW, MRS. EMERSON, AND BE A GOOD WIFE TO BILL. SHE'D HAVE WANTED IT THAT WAY. I KNOWED HER WELL ENOUGH TO SAY THAT. EBEN, MR. LINDLEY'S OUT HERE. ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU NOW, BUT YOU JUST KIND OF BE THINKING OVER WHAT I JUST TOLD YOU. YOU CAN TALK TO HER NOW. YEAH, THANK YOU. I WON'T TALK TO YOU VERY LONG, DEAR. I DON'T WANT TO TIRE YOU. CAN YOU UNDERSTAND ME, PAT? BILL IS COMING HOME. I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL AFTERNOON FOR AN ANSWER TO MY WIRE, AND IT JUST GOT HERE. HE ARRIVES IN NEW YORK BY PLANE... FRIDAY. FRIDAY. I WAS SURE WE WERE GOING TO BE LATE, BUT I GUESS WE'RE NOT. I MUST LOOK A SIGH AFTER THAT DRIVE. WELL, FRANKLY, UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, I DON'T THINK BILL EXPECTS YOU TO LOOK LIKE A RAVING BEAUTY. PAN AMERICAN AIRWAYS FLIGHT NUMBER 7 NOW ARRIVING AT GATE TWO. IS THAT BILL'S PLANE? YES. YES, IT IS. FREDDIE? FREDDIE, I... I FEEL RATHER SEEDY. I THINK I'LL HAVE A DRINK. YOURS IS A MARTINI, ISN'T IT, PAT? YES, FREDDIE. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? THANK YOU. ONE MARTINI, PLEASE. ONE MARTINI. WELL, THERE IT IS. YOU STAY HERE AND HAVE YOUR DRINK. I'LL GET BILL, AND WE'LL BE BACK. BILL! HELLO, PAT. YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE BOTHERED TO COME DOWN HERE TO MEET ME. OH, OF COURSE I'D MEE YOU. DON'T BE SILLY. I'M TERRIBLY SORRY ABOUT KATE. I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND IF WE STAY IN NEW YORK FOR A FEW DAYS SO I CAN STRAIGHTEN OU SOME OF HER THINGS. OH, THAT'LL FIT IN WITH MY PLANS. I'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO HERE. DID YOU HAVE A PLEASANT TRIP? GOOD AFTERNOON, MRS. EMERSON. GOOD AFTERNOON, ELISE. HELLO, MRS. JOHNSON. I'M SO SORRY, MY DEAR. THANK YOU. WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO UPSTAIRS? WE HAVE YOUR OLD ROOM ALL READY FOR YOU. OH, NO. NO, THANK YOU. I THINK WE'LL ALL STAY DOWN HERE AND HAVE A DRINK. I KNOW I'D LIKE ONE. HOW ABOUT YOU, FREDDIE? WELL, NOT FOR ME, THANK YOU. I HAVE A BUSINESS APPOINTMENT. OH, BUT YOU SIMPLY CAN'T LEAVE US. WELL, I'LL DROP AROUND TOMORROW, IF I MAY. WELL, YOU'RE BEING DREADFULLY UNSOCIAL. GOOD-BYE, OLD MAN. CALL ME IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO. THANKS A LOT FOR YOUR HELP, FREDDIE. IT'S ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU TOMORROW, FREDDIE. OK, PAT. SHALL WE GO IN THE LIBRARY? CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW, IT REALLY HIT FREDDIE. I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM QUITE THIS WAY BEFORE. I KNOW JUST HOW HE FEELS. IT'S VERY STRANGE FOR ME WITHOUT KATE. WOULD YOU LIKE A SCOTCH? YOU KNOW I DRINK BOURBON, PAT. OH, YES, OF COURSE. YOU LOOK TIRED, BILL. I WAS THINKING OF KATE. YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S GONE, SOMEHOW. I DIDN'T KNOW SHE MEAN SO MUCH TO YOU. WE WERE VERY GOOD FRIENDS. DOESN'T MEAN THAT I WAS IN LOVE WITH HER. SHE KNEW THAT. HOW DO YOU KNOW? WELL, SHE... SHE TOLD ME, JUST BEFORE THE WEDDING. BILL, I'VE MISSED YOU VERY MUCH. I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T GO TO CHILE WITH YOU, BILL. THERE'S NOTHING ANY DIFFERENT BETWEEN US. I CAME BACK ONLY BECAUSE OF KATE'S DEATH. WHY THE ASTONISHMENT? DON'T TRY TO PRETEND THAT YOU'VE FORGOTTEN, PAT. OH, NO. NO, OF COURSE I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN. I ONLY THOUGH THAT PERHAPS I- I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT. THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T GO DIRECTLY TO A HOTEL. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THE ACCIDEN OCCURRED AT THIS TIME, BUT I THINK THAT JUST AS SOON AS YOU GET KATE'S AFFAIRS WOUND UP, YOU'D BETTER GO TO RENO AND GET IT OVER WITH. WHAT'S THAT NOISE? OH, UH... I'LL GO AND SEE. 25 YEARS, AND NEVER ONCE HAS ANYONE USED THE KIND OF LANGUAGE YOU USE! NOT TO MENTION THE WAY YOU ORDER SELF-RESPECTING PEOPLE AROUND! A GOOD-FOR-NOTHING SCALAWAG LIKE YOU! WHY- GET OUT, GET OUT! AND KEEP YOUR MEDDLING PAWS OFF MY WORK! ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT! OH, MISS PATRICIA, I'M SORRY, BUT WHEN MISS KATE WAS HERE, SHE ALLOWED THIS MAN TO USE THE STUDIO, AND NOW I CAN'T GET RID OF HIM! GO ON, BEAT IT, GRANDMA. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, MRS. JOHNSON. VERY WELL. SO YOU'RE PATRICIA. YES, I'M PATRICIA. I DON'T SEE MUCH DIFFERENCE... EXCEPT MAYBE AROUND THE EYES. WILL YOU COME IN HERE FOR A MINUTE? PLEASE? I HIT THE EYES PERFECTLY. I THOUGHT YOURS WERE DIFFERENT. THEY'RE NOT, NOT A BIT. WILL YOU SIT HERE? LOOK AT ME. I USED TO DRIVE YOUR SISTER CRAZY. SHE WAS QUITE A GIRL. THIS WAY. IT'S INCREDIBLE. COULD ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU AND KATE APART? NO. NOT EVEN BILL. BILL WHO? MY HUSBAND BILL EMERSON. SO THAT'S THE EMERSON GUY. TOO BAD KATE WASN' MORE OF A FIGHTER. YOU DIDN'T LIKE YOUR SISTER VERY MUCH, DID YOU? WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT? NO, IT ISN'T TRUE. YOU TWO PROBABLY DISLIKED EACH OTHER FROM THE TIME YOU WERE BORN, AND WHY SHOULDN'T YOU DISLIKE EACH OTHER? IT'S A PERFECTLY NATURAL ANTAGONISM. SHE SAID YOU WERE SO ATTRACTIVE, YOU COULD HAVE ANY MAN YOU WANTED, AND YOU WANTED HER MAN. I- KATE NEVER SAID A THING LIKE THAT. HOW DO YOU KNOW? WELL, I-I JUST KNOW SHE NEVER WOULD. THAT'S ALL. SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING TO ME. I KNEW HER BETTER THAN SHE KNEW HERSELF. WILL YOU EXCUSE ME? BILL. BILL, THERE'S A FRIEND OF KATE'S IN THE STUDIO THERE, WORKING ON A PORTRAIT OF HER. I'VE BEEN POSING FOR HIM. SUDDENLY, THIS WHOLE HOUSE IS MAKING ME SO NERVOUS. WOULD YOU MIND VERY MUCH IF I WENT TO BOSTON TONIGHT? I CAN COME BACK LATER AND STRAIGHTEN OUT KATE'S THINGS. I UNDERSTAND. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I'LL GO TO A HOTEL. IT WILL SAVE US BOTH A LOT OF EMBARRASSMENT. I'LL TELL MRS. JOHNSON TO REPACK MY THINGS. OH, BILL, COULD WE LET THIS DIVORCE BUSINESS RIDE UNTIL YOU GET TO BOSTON? I CAN'T SEEM TO THINK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. WHAT'S THERE TO THINK ABOUT? BILL... I WAN ANOTHER CHANCE. DO YOU THINK YOU DESERVE ONE? MAYBE NOT, BUT I WANT IT. THAT'S THE FIRST HONES THING YOU'VE SAID IN MONTHS. LET ME TRY. ALL RIGHT. YOU'LL PROBABLY CHANGE YOUR MIND ONCE YOU GET HOME, BUT IN THE MEANTIME, WE-WE'LL LET I GO AT THAT. THANK YOU, BILL. OH, DON'T BOTHER TO COME TO THE STATION WITH ME. I'D RATHER GO ALONE. OH, WILL YOU CALL FREDDIE AND TELL HIM I'VE GONE? CERTAINLY. BE SURE AND WIRE ME WHEN YOU'RE COMING. I - I'D LIKE TO HAVE EVERYTHING READY FOR YOU. GOOD-BYE, BILL. GOOD-BYE, PAT. GOOD EVENING, MRS. EMERSON. GOOD EVENING. WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO GET THE HOUSE IN ORDER EVER SINCE WE GOT YOUR WIRE. YOU DIDN'T GIVE US MUCH TIME. I REALIZE THAT. THANK YOU. EVERYTHING LOOKS VERY NICE. THANK YOU, MA'AM. WE DIDN'T EXPECT YOU BACK FOR QUITE AWHILE. WELL, I WANTED TO OPEN UP THE HOUSE. MR. EMERSON WILL BE HOME IN A DAY OR SO. FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES! I THOUGH HE WAS GONE FOR ALL SUMMER. MIKE'S BEEN SO LONELY WITHOUT YOU. MIKE, GO OVER AND SEE YOUR MISTRESS. FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? MIKE SEEMS TO HAVE FORGOTTEN ME FOR THE MOMENT. HELLO, MIKE. WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO GO UP TO YOUR ROOM? THERE ARE A COUPLE OF MESSAGES FOR YOU. MR. AND MRS. DEVERAUX CALLED. OH, DID THEY? THEY'RE LEAVING TOMORROW. I'LL CALL THEM LATER. MR. TALBO SENT THE ROSES. OH? HE'S BEEN CALLING EVERY DAY SINCE THE ACCIDENT. I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D MIND IF I TOLD HIM YOU WERE COMING HOME. I THINK HE EXPECTS YOU TO CALL HIM, MRS. EMERSON. I'LL ATTEND TO IT LATER. OH, YOU-YOU NEEDN'T BOTHER TO UNPACK UNTIL THE MORNING. DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL HIM? WHAT? MR. TALBOT. HE'LL BE AT HIS REGULAR NUMBER ALL EVENING. I SAID I'D ATTEND TO IT LATER. VERY WELL, MADAM. THERE YOU GO. YOU'RE A LITTLE BEGGAR. THERE. REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU, MIKE. YOU'VE GO TO BE MY FRIEND. GOOD AFTERNOON, MR. EMERSON. GOOD AFTERNOON. HERE. TAKE THESE THINGS UPSTAIRS FOR ME, WILL YOU, LUCY, PLEASE? HELLO, BILL. HELLO. SHALL I BRING IN THE COCKTAILS RIGHT AWAY? YES. AND WE'LL HAVE DINNER IN AN HOUR. HELLO, MIKE! HIYA, BOY. HEY, MIKE. WELL, YOU LOOK RESTED. YES, I AM. ALMA AND I HAVE PLANNED YOUR FAVORITE DINNER. OH, WE'RE STAYING HOME TONIGHT. I THOUGH IT WOULD BE FUN. WHY, YES, IT WOULD. EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO AND WASH UP. BILL, IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU. OH, MIKE. YOU ARE MY FRIEND. HELP YOURSELF TO CREAM AND SUGAR, WON'T YOU, BILL? ALL RIGHT. HERE'S YOUR TOBACCO. THANK YOU. ISN'T ALMA THE WORLD'S BEST COOK? WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE HER. WE ARE. MIKE WAS VERY LONELY WITHOUT ME. WEREN'T YOU, MIKE? PAT, I KNOW ALL THIS IS AS DIFFICULT FOR YOU AS IT IS FOR ME. OH, BUT IT ISN'T, BILL. I LOVE BEING HERE WITH YOU. YOU DO BELIEVE THAT, DON'T YOU? I WANT TO. YOU KNOW THAT. WHAT ABOUT TALBOT? HAVE YOU SEEN HIM? NO. SURELY, YOU MUST REALIZE THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO GET STRAIGHT BETWEEN US. I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM. DON'T YOU THINK YOU OWE IT TO HIM TO TELL HIM THAT IT'S ALL OVER? OR PERHAPS IT ISN'T OVER. OH, YES, IT IS, BILL. I SWEAR IT. HE'S TELEPHONED ME TWO OR 3 TIMES AND... AND SENT ME FLOWERS. I HAVEN' ACKNOWLEDGED THEM. I- I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE IT. PAT, UNTIL YOU GE THIS TALBOT THING STRAIGHTENED OU ONCE AND FOR ALL, THERE ISN'T ANYTHING MORE WE CAN SAY TO EACH OTHER. BILL! GOOD AFTERNOON, MRS. EMERSON. GOOD AFTERNOON. WOULD YOU TELL MR. TALBO THAT I'M HERE? I'M QUITE SURE HE'S IN. THANK YOU. HELLO, DARLING. HELLO. MAY I TAKE YOUR COAT? OH. YES, THANK YOU. HOW ABOUT A MARTINI? I DON'T BELIEVE I FEEL LIKE ONE. I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU. YES. LUCY TOLD ME THAT BILL WAS BACK. I MUST SAY I WAS SURPRISED... CONSIDERING EVERYTHING. HE CAME BACK LAST NIGHT. AND JUST WHERE DOES THAT PUT ME? I HAVE SOMETHING I MUST TELL YOU. I FIND OUT I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH BILL. I'M SORRY. THAT'S PERFECT. YOU MESS UP MY LIFE, AND YOU SAY YOU'RE SORRY. I HAPPEN TO HAVE ARRANGED TO DIVORCE MY WIFE FOR YOUR SAKE. I SUPPOSE IT NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU THA SOMEONE COULD SAY A THING AND MEAN IT. WELL, HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL NOT SEEING YOU FOR DAYS? THERE'S SOMETHING BEHIND ALL THIS. OH, NO! NO, THERE ISN'T. YOU MUST BELIEVE THAT. I LOVE BILL. I ALWAYS WILL. PAT, YOU CAN'T MEAN THIS AFTER ALL WE'VE MEANT TO EACH OTHER. SO IT WAS JUS AN INTERLUDE WITH YOU. YES, THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. YOU DIRTY LITTLE DOUBLE-CROSSER. YOU'RE DOING TO ME WHAT YOU DID WITH ALL THE OTHERS, AREN'T YOU? YOU DIDN'T THINK I KNEW ABOUT THEM. DON'T THINK THAT PEOPLE HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT YOUR ROTTEN LITTLE SCANDALS. THINGS GET AROUND, YOU KNOW. YOU'RE NOT A VERY DISCREET PERSON. I WISH I- GET OUT. I CAN'T FACE HIM. I CAN'T. I CAN'T. WHY THE SUITCASE, PAT? I'M LEAVING, BILL. MAY I ASK WHY? YOU WERE RIGHT. IT WOULDN' HAVE WORKED OUT. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WOULDN'T. YOU'VE SEEN TALBOT. YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE WITH HIM-IS THAT IT? OH, NO. I DON'T WAN TO TALK ABOUT IT. WELL, IF YOU'RE NO STILL IN LOVE WITH HIM, THEN WHY ARE YOU LEAVING? OH, BILL. YOU CAN' WANT ME TO STAY, CAN YOU? NOT AFTER- YOU SAID THE ONLY THING TO BE STRAIGHTENED OU BETWEEN US WAS THE TALBOT BUSINESS. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS? MUCH WORSE. SURELY YOU KNEW ABOUT THEM. IF YOU DIDN'T, YOU WERE A FOOL. DON'T YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN THE LAUGHINGSTOCK OF THIS WHOLE TOWN? WELL, HELLO, MY DEAR. HELLO, FREDDIE. LET ME TAKE YOUR COAT. ALL RIGHT. I HAVE YOUR ROOM READY. OH, THAT'S SWEE OF YOU, FREDDIE. I HOPE I WON'T BE A NUISANCE. OH, NONSENSE. IT'S A ROTTEN NIGHT OUT, ISN'T IT? I LIKE THE FOG. MY, YOU LOOK PRETTY WELL ALL IN. SHALL I GET YOU SOME TEA? NO, THANK YOU. AHH. NOW THAT I'M HERE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I HAD SO MANY THINGS TO TELL YOU. YOU SEE, I'VE LEFT BILL. THAT ISN'T WHA I WANTED TO SAY AT ALL. FREDDIE, IF I WERE TO TELL YOU- WAIT A MINUTE. I BELIEVE I KNOW WHA YOU WANT TO TELL ME... KATE. HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN? WELL, I SUSPECTED JUST AFTER THE ACCIDENT, BUT I TRIED TO PUT SUCH THOUGHTS OUT OF MY MIND. AND THEN WHEN YOU CALLED AND SAID YOU WERE COMING HERE, OF COURSE, I KNEW. IT'S ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE THAT YOU WOULD DO SUCH A THING. IT SEEMED MY ONLY CHANCE FOR HAPPINESS. BUT YOU WERE NEVER A LIAR, KATE. HOW COULD YOU THINK YOU COULD LIVE A LIE? I DIDN'T THINK. I JUST LET IT HAPPEN. OH, IT WAS SO SIMPLE AT FIRST. IT WASN'T GOING TO HURT ANYBODY. BUT AFTER I'D FOUND OUT HOW... HOW PA HAD TREATED BILL, I COULDN'T GO THROUGH WITH IT. SHE HURT HIM SO TERRIBLY. HE'LL NEVER FORGET. NO MATTER WHA I TRY TO DO, IT WILL ALWAYS BE THERE. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? I DON'T KNOW. I WANT TO DO WHA WILL HURT HIM THE LEAST. TO A MAN LIKE BILL, THE TRUTH IS THE ONLY WAY. FREDDIE, WOULD YOU FORGIVE ME IF I WENT UP TO MY ROOM? CERTAINLY. YOU SEE, FREDDIE, BILL NEVER LOVED ME. I'VE NEVER BROUGHT ANYONE HERE BEFORE. THE ONE TIME THA I WISH I COULD PAIN IS WHEN I'M HERE. KATIE, DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU COULD CATCH THIS? I'LL MISS YOU, TOO, KATIE. YOU KNOW THAT. KATIE! OH, KATIE. OH, KATIE, I KNEW I'D FIND YOU HERE. THEN YOU KNOW. YES, I KNOW. I CAN'T EVEN ASK YOU TO FORGIVE ME. I DON'T WANT YOU TO ASK ME ANYTHING. I DON'T WANT YOU TO TELL ME ANYTHING. YOU'RE ALREADY SUFFERED SO MUCH FOR BOTH OF US. OH, BILL. BILL. EVEN BACK AT THE LIGHTHOUSE THAT NIGHT, YOU KNEW. I WAS THE ONE WHO DIDN'T. I WASN'T READY. OH, YES, I FELL IN LOVE WITH PAT, BUT IT WAS NEVER RIGHT- NOT THE WAY THAT WE WERE ALWAYS RIGHT FOR EACH OTHER. I KNOW THAT NOW. OH, KATIE. LET'S-LET'S FORGE EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED AS THOUGH WE NEVER LEFT THE ISLAND. CAN YOU DO THAT? OH, KATIE, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
