Very, generous of you, letting a stranger come and stay with us. We have to help her, Mama. - You don't even know her. That's so German, Mama. She's illegal here. She's persecuted in her country.

We hope you have a pleasant stay. And you know you can only stay three nights a month. I've left the key for you here. Goodbye. - Bye. In the name of the people I pronounce the following judgment the appeal against the ruling by the Administrative Court of April 18. 2007, is rejected. Court fees will not be charged. The plaintiff shall bear the costs of the proceedings. You may be seated. Ms. Ozturk your appeal was bound to fail. The Administrative Court rightly rejected your claim to be acknowledged as entitled to asylum. In line with the Constitution, The right of asylum shall be granted. to anyone who is persecuted on grounds of his or her religion, race, nationality adherence to a social group or political convictions and fears danger to body and soul or restrictions to his or her own freedom. Where have you hidden it? haven't hidden your passport! - Stop lying to me! In the light of Turkey's plans for membership of the EU, it can no longer be assumed that on returning to Turkey after an unsuccessful appeal for asylum, you must fear physical maltreatment or torture. Here! Look how blind you are. The Court sees the difficulty of your situation and finds your political commitment in Turkey credible. I understand why you entered the country illegally a year ago. But in accordance with the legal standards applicable here, we cannot assume that you will now be endangered in Turkey so as to warrant political asylum. Take care of yourself! So you're not interested in whether or not my friend is being tortured? Can you prove it? Miss Staub, non-Germans in Turkish prisons is not our responsibility. I'm very sorry. Do you know anyone who might help me? Wait a moment. This is the address of BARO prisoners who can't afford a lawyer turn to this organization. Maybe they can help you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Ayten Ozturk is accused of being a member of an armed organization that the state regards as terrorist. She could get a very long sentence. Such as? Where is she now? In Uskudar women's prison waiting to be sentenced! Can I visit her? He sees that you're not related to the prisoner. Without the same surname it's very difficult. What kind of law is that? This is Turkey. He can try to get you a permit. But it might take one or two months. And you must never mention! the name Ayten Ozturk. Not to anyone. Okay? Okay. This is-all going to take longer. - Is it? How long, then? I don't know exactly. Six months.. - What? Six months?! Maybe less. - And what about your studies? There's no point in all of that any more, anyway. Now, Lotte. Let me tell you something. I've had enough of it. I won't go along with it any more! You can't keep wasting your life! For the first time, my life has a purpose! For the first time, I'm needed. I've got to help Ayten! And how? In a foreign country where you don't know anyone? I'll get her a lawyer. Ha ha! You'll get her a lawyer. And who, pray, will pay for that? Do you know what your girlfriend has cost me? Did you ever ask yourself that? For a whole year I paid her solicitor's fees. And we lost! Can't you ask Papa? Oh no, I most certainly won't ask him. Lotte? I want you to come back. No, Mama. - Please. Mama. I can't. Fine. Then stay there. But see how you cope on your own. I won't help you. From now on, you're finally on your own. Mama? - Hello. - Good afternoon. Do you have a notice board for people looking for accommodation? Yes, up by the door. Thanks. - You're welcome. Do you have any books on the Turkish legal system? Let me have a look. I m not sure. Amnesty International, "Turkey 2005", including political cases. Can I take a look? - Here, feel free. Would you like a glass of tea? - Yes, please. Cengiz, tea for the lady and for me, please. Are you studying law? No. I studied Spanish and English. Oh.. See you. I'm about to close. Dan I borrow this? This isn't a library. Okay. - Is this your card? - Yes. I've got a room for rent. What's your interest in the Turkish legal system? I have a girlfriend who's in prison here. What for? I don't really know myself. Whats your friend's name? Gul. Gul Korkmaz. This is the room. - And how much is it? - 200 euros a month. Okay. Ayten! I have to talk to you. - Efsane, you take over! Comrades are coming from Van for an important meeting. They want to talk about the plans for our group. We've promised to protect them. Where did you hide it? How do I know I can trust you? Are you crazy? - Dunno. Maybe. Don't mess with me, or I'll kill you. Hey, sister, buy some tissues, please. Please sister! What's that? Let's sell it! Give it to me! - No, it's mine! What do you want sister? Please come in, Ayten. Please sit down. Could you close the window please? Who visited you yesterday? I'm not answering any questions without my lawyer! We're not asking you to betray anyone. I don't care about your organization. But we have an international crisis on our hands. Important men from abroad are here asking questions. We are peacefully asking you for your cooperation. Yesterday afternoon you had a visit from a German citizen. and five hours later she was found shot dead on the street. Why? How did you know her? If you answer our questions we'll help you.

I was here 30 years ago. It all looked different then. What were you doing here 30 years ago? I was hitchhiking to India. It was the thing to do then. I put her things in the boxes. Thank you. Is there anything else I can do for you? I'd like to stay here. Of course. 'These steps, my steps, I want to take with strength. With courage. Even if Mama doesn't always understand that. Which I find surprising.. She was just like that herself. Or rather, independently of her story, which I've learned only gradually, / find myself taking paths very similar to hers.. Perhaps it's that. She sees herself in me. I asked if he wanted to see you, but he said you wouldn't want to. I said he could stay with me for a few days, but he wanted to go straight to Trabzon. I took him to the bus station yesterday evening. What's he doing in Trabzon? - He said he wanted to go fishing. I'll be gone, cousin! And? Anyone ever call? I'm off.

Ibrahim took his son, Ismail, to the sacrificial mount. But just as he was about to kill him, his knife went blunt. God was satisfied and sent Ibrahim a sheep to sacrifice in place of his son. We have the same story. I remember asking my father if he would sacrifice me, too. I was afraid of this story as a child. My mother died young you know.. And what did your father answer? He said that he would even make god his enemy... In order to protect me. Is your father still alive? Would you look after my bookshop for a few days? - Happy Bayram. - Thanks.
