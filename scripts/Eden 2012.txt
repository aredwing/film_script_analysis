They know it already. They ask, it's probably the FBI. Just hang up. You'll just note address, date and time. Tear it off. Give it to me. Are you with me? And. - I test you. What is 5 x 9? - Indian or Pakistani. You are really good. I've just gone for a few hours. Kets can you please doctor cat. Release them out, but set handcuffs at first. How are you?

Continue down the road. The nurse gets all needles from a drug store in Reno. Do not step on the accelerator and brake at the same time. It does not work. We get leg irons from the parole board. Bob knows all there. Our Pakistani partners gives us passports and driving licenses. Can you stop the car? I have drligt. We get opium from Mexico. We are alone. Morphine. Before it could not get anyone to do anything. You you on stueetagen in. .. ... The most well-run enterprise. We work in all areas. Bob is not even at the top. It is much larger than Bob. The girls have it better here. Their parents junkie shit on them. They let them get diseases and all kinds of shit. It's sad. Svetlana's mother sold her to her grandfather when she was nine - - Because mom's new boyfriend would not have a brat in the house. It is diseased. So it goes too far. What the hell is wrong with you? Should probably would not have given you amphetamine after morphine syringe. Do you take checks? Should I take control? I'm not one of those bastards. Not one of the pricks. So away from me and run. What is it for a 19-year-old, who can not drive a car? Think of America's roads veins. The pumps nutrients and oxygen and keep the cells alive. A living organism. But we forget that the blood also leads waste products away from the cells. What happens then? Where are they? These waste products adapt to their environment, depending on what they are. And like all viruses are sabotaging the end system. That's how I can best explain the illegal trade. To view an average courier out. Rar old mand. Who would suspect a nice old lady? The nice old lady dumped more dirt in Vegas than Chernobyl the 1986th It took us five years to get busted her. So ... one who went out of high school. Housewives. Biker. Upper-class girls. All kinds. So, who are you looking for? The answer is everyone. Good. Have a good trip home, ladies and gentlemen. Nice to talk to you. - Good to get away from the office. - Sheriff Gault! - Ron Greer. From Stove Canyon. - Lake Havasu? Fish Competition? No, I called your office. Would make contact now we're both here. Yes da. What ringede about? A double murder in river valleys last year. Deputy Sheriff Ellis and Albert Alawa. - God. How's the track? - Why would I talk to you. - You were in the area at the time. - Are you sure? Well, we have tested a GPS system. Most often does not produce anything. But the spores mobile activity sometimes. So we tried. Your mobile number showed up. Not in a precise place. 1.5 km from Raven Creek. - On hearing distance from the crime scene. - Damn me. I hope so not. Maybe it's a bad time, I can come by your office? Do not know what to say other than it is here, do not remember that I was there. And I do not remember having encountered two bodies. It is usual well to remember? Yes, I would imagine. I'll call if I were to think of anything, Mr. ... Greer. Thanks for your time. It was an excellent speech. - Dusty Oasis, can I help? - I have two 7 x 10 - Okay.

We'll fix it with Ivan, and then you're in bed. We must piss up early. - I thought of sending smoke signals. - Fine boat, Bob. You're not so naive and innocent anymore? - What's the deal behind? - The nurse prohibit burning. It smells out of the way. To be drowned or buried, and I do not dig. - Is our friend Svetlana with that? - Yes. Here she is. Hope there are walleye in the lake today. I say no to the Internet stuff. This industry should not be dressed up with technology. You just do it easier for a freak to trace the source. - What the hell is wrong with you? - What? Try to relax. Jeez, you make me nervous. So ... how's the investigation? - I heard about it. Is it ... - You think I want to talk about it? Vaughan is socially retarded, his foster parents were Mennonites. Religious fanatics. - Do you know what a Bible marker is? - Bob ... Be marked sections with them. There is little sayings on them. Vaughan was only the markers to play with. And he did not learn to read until he was 16 Was it 16? It can go either way with such a godly upbringing. But Vaughan's primary instincts are not in the sacred direction. I believe that if you are born in sin ... so you live in sin. But the army trains him. The army is like a alfons. Tager anyone with a pulse ... Okay, Bob. It is enough. I give up. Can never get the boy to express his feelings. As to teach the blind colors. I'm trying to help you, kid. Believe me, it gets better for you when I finish with this. Oops! I fik one! See how it runs. Not worth the effort to clean it. Shut up! It was an order from the top. You can relax. - Where are you going? - The toilet. - You go when I say it. - Come on, Ivan. You go when I say it. By place. Excursion. - Chef, hey! What then? - You look good. Have you trained? Not required. Have dog. - How many months? - I do not know. - Not on my dining table. - Why not? Relax. - I've lost lighter.

Save shampoo so the damn thing does not use it to masturbate with. Oh god! Shut up. - Did it for you? - What? What are you doing here? - They provide me and my baby. - No. We must get you out of here. You look different. - Are you here with them? - No. You are here with them! Quiet. They are on the side. Do they hear you kill me. Eden! Come here, damn it! Bob you on TV! ... Searching for Sheriff Robert Gault is interrupted. The family ... - How he looks good. - Quiet! I want to hear. Gault was the son of a test pilot. He joined the army in 1977. Dit fede pig! - I want to hear! - Take it easy. Han blev sherif i 1985. Specialists in smuggling and illegal drugs. He is remembered as a husband, father, and an asset to his community and country. Pis og PAPIR! - Pull off the road. Away from the road! - Where? Here! Run into. Turn! Continue. Stop her. Stop. Say what you saw in the house. - A room which looked like a hospital. - You know what it's for? - Sell infants. - Say that again. - Why? - Say it again! Sell infants. Do you get it bad? I mucked up the first time I saw it. Dig generating it. Come on, Vaughan. Let's run. Are you really in on it here? For you shall not go so far and then just ... betray me. - Why would I betray you? - Not why, but how. Shut the fuck! What do you want me to do? Everybody out. Out of the carriage. Out! Eden, out. You must see this. In addition, before I drag you out! It you do not want. Come out and down on his knees. See the way. - Do you shoot her? - No. You must. Take it. No. Hold it against her head. She felt nothing. Smertefrit. Humant. Shoot her. If it is not her then it becomes you. Come her. Come her. Can not believe that you would actually do it. Crazy girl. Want some food? Are you hungry? Come on, we get something to eat. That's fine. Relax. I was joking. You know what that means? Into the cart. - Hallo? - Vaughan? - Where are you? You have to go back now. - We are on the way back now. We have orders to pack. Must get the girls ready for transport. Ivan, you live yet? Avni, I asked you to destroy the traitor's head. Do I need to do your work? Do it for anything in the world. Come. What happens? - We're moving. - Where to? We'll find out. We move boxes. They are dirty. There is no time to be sentimental, Eden. We wear them out of the fire. Do you remember when Ivan took only away for Christmas? I think he's got problems. The dirt has get with a microphone silk januar. Bob was lucky that we took him at that time. He ended up as an asshole and not the brand that everyone loves and laments. Go through passports and choose one that looks like you. - Where are we going? - What? We're going to Dubai. - Are you afraid to go to Dubai? - Yes. Do not whore out there. It's you and me.
