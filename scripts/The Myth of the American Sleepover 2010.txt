As good as last summer. Well, it looks like tomorrow will be a beautiful Labor Day with a slight chance of rain overnight. But don't cancel your parade or barbecue plans. It should clear up in the morning. Speaking of afternoons, here's a song to make yours a more enjoyable one. Maggie, we should get to practice. I just feel like I should've done more this summer. You did a lot. I mean fun stuff. Like... I don't know. You stole two beers today. Beth, stop trying to cheer me up. Let's step it up. Come on. All right, bring it in. You're fucking fast. I guess so. I'm Janelle. Junior. Claudia. Sophomore. I didn't see you in school last year. I just moved here a couple months ago. Oh. Are you dating Sean Barber? I saw you both at a party last week. Oh, yeah. You didn't look like you were having much fun. No, I just don't know anybody yet. I'm having friends stay over at my house tonight if you want to come. It'll be fun. Yeah, it sounds nice. Beer or liquor? I don't know. You're dating a senior, and you don't know if you're a beer or liquor girl? Wine? What time should I come over? Whenever. 8:00 or 9:00. Okay. Bye. Hey, what are you doing here? Mom said you needed a ride. Oh, yeah. Can you give me a few minutes to finish? Sure. Thanks, Scott. Will Rob Salvati please come to the front of the store? Your mother is looking for you. Rob Salvati, please come to the front of the store. So are we not hanging out tonight? I think I'm gonna go to that sleepover. Oh, at Janelle's? You know her? Uh, not really. You going? Yeah. I think it might be nice to start school with some new friends. I guess I could hang out with my friends tonight too. Okay. Janelle's crowd isn't really the best crowd. You know? Do you not want me to go? No, go. I'll find something else to do. I really want to see her again. Maybe you will. There's gonna be kids in our class from three other middle schools on Monday. Yeah, but she'll probably get picked off by a senior the first day. I'm sure she will. I want to show you a picture. This is a different girl? The one l- you know, in North Carolina. She's pretty. Slap! Should light that candle. Uh, I don't have anything to light it with. You smoke? No. I used to like a guy who smoked. Keep it. I don't need it. Thanks. Emma! Come here. Guess what Sara did. What? Thanks for waiting. No problem. I told my friends you were going back to college, and Janelle Ramsey told me to tell you that she wanted to sleep with you, but you always had a girlfriend. Wow. Well, tell her I'm available. She was just fucking around anyway. Figures. Mom said you're not going back to Chicago. Getting dumped isn't a reason to drop out of school. It actually is a reason. Not a good one. What are you gonna do around here, anyway? Drink? Do you know what ever happened to the Abbey twins? They graduated last year. I haven't really seen them around this summer. But they liked you back in high school. No, they didn't. Seriously. One of them, at least. Twins. Good work. Remember, I need you all here no later than 8:30 tomorrow morning. It's an honor to be in the parade, and I want smiling, well-rested faces. Just so you know, you all are invited tonight, so just make sure you bring something to sleep on, 'cause my mom's a bitch, and she doesn't want us sleeping on her furniture. Yay. A sleepover. Maybe it'll be all right. Let's go over there. He's not that cute. Yes, he is. Hey, Cameron. Hey, Maggie. What's up? Nothing. Just gonna get ready for our friend's sleepover. Cool. I haven't been to a girls' sleepover in a while. You're welcome to come. Thanks, but that's probably not allowed. Probably not. Can I have one? No. You two really shouldn't be over here very long. Why not? I could get in trouble. All right, one cigarette. Then you got to go. What are you up to tonight? Probably going to a party. What kind of party? Just a swimming and drinking kind of party. Oh, you two got to go. That's my parents. Bye. Where's the party? Uh... What's the address? I only know the street. I'll find it. The Grand Mosquita is curious about your quest. How do we know it won't destroy us? You must believe us. Tell us where the treasure is. We are the true treasure, the daughters of Mosquita. Once you find the hidden chamber, we will be transformed and made human. The monster will never allow it. Mosquita will not stand in the way of our heart. Through its bite it will spread its nectar, and we will be free to choose a well-born mate. You've reached the Abbeys. We're not home... But if you leave a message, we'll get back to you. Beep! Hey, Jen. Whose house you going to? Janelle Ramsey's. Sleepover. We're going to Tom Higgins'. I guess guys don't call 'em sleepovers. We do, but just not in public. Is it just Kelvin Middle School kids there? I don't know. Janelle's got friends from a couple different schools. Why? Rob's in love with this blonde girl he saw at Food-mart this afternoon. Well, stop by later. Maybe she'll be there. Thanks. You messed around with her, didn't you? Yeah. So he was over at your house? His mom asked my mom if he could stay at our house while they visited some aunt. I kissed her, and we started making out. She a good kisser? Yeah. What happened? He just sat on my couch eating cheese puffs while I kept trying to hold his hand. I think it would've gone further, but her mom came home. She realized that I had a boy in the living room, so she actually closed the doors to the den to give us some privacy. Then did anything happen? I finally gave up, and we just watched cartoons. That was a pretty good afternoon. Has anybody seen Sandy? I think she went swimming in the creek. She just wants to take her clothes off in front of all of the guys. "Hey, boys! You can call me skinny-dipping Sandy. " Rewind it. I got it. "Hey, boys! You can call me skinny-dipping Sandy. " Maybe we should go look for her. Sandy's fine. She's probably hitting a home run with one of those guys from cabin five. Or maybe third base. Probably a double header. Where are you going? Come on! I would. Yeah. This movie's not even fucking scary. Oh, shut up. You're so stupid. Yeah, we'll see. I miss you too. So stupid. Fuck you guys! He usually keeps extra blankets in here, I think. Okay. My brother is such a pervert. Yeah, he is. Mandy! Could you come downstairs for a second? Yeah, Mom, I'm coming! Ugh, I'll be right back. What are you doing? I just wanted to talk to you. Rob, right? If I yell for my mom, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. Okay. If you want to sit down, you can. Go back downstairs. Why? Come on. Can I kiss you? No. Have you ever seen a naked girl before? Yeah. Get my brother and your friends and go find some girls or something. Try to have some fun. So last Christmas, my parents got me this mirror as a present. I totally froze up and thought they knew what I was doing. They didn't? No. I just smiled and said thank you and told 'em I'd get a lot of use out of it. My mom seemed really happy. Janelle, mirrors are for snorting coke, not smoking pot. Like Jen's ever snorted coke. Me too. Sorry. Are you really friends with Janelle? Are you? Where's the bathroom? Um, it's right down the hallway, through Janelle's room. Okay. Let's get everyone to go to one of the girls' sleepovers. You just want to see that girl again. No, I don't. We can go. Go, go, go, go! Go, go! Hey, um, is my sister Jen here? Yes, your sister Jen is here. Can I talk to her? Mm-hmm. Hey. See ya later, Scott. Yeah. Do you know where the Abbey twins are? Seriously? Yeah. Like, where do they work? They worked at the Dairy-O. Okay, so I can just go down- No, I told you they're starting school. They left this weekend for U of M. Ann Arbor. Yeah, some freshman welcome sleepover. Okay. Thank you, sister. I love you. I love you too, but you're weird. I know. Bye, Scott. Bye, Scott. This looks like the place. Yeah, it does. Hey, can I get in that sleeping bag with you? You guys can sleep in it together if you want. Hey, kids. Hey, pool girl. Pool boy. This party's over. Do you want to go swimming with us? Yeah. You can come with us. Our bikes. In the trunk. Hi, guys. Hi, Katie. I can't have guys over. I'm gonna get in trouble. What if we're quiet? You girls could come back to my house. My parents won't know. We'll think about it. Could I come in for a minute just by myself? Why? I'm looking for somebody, and I want to see if she's here. If you're quiet. Let's go back to my house. What am I doing? This is a great idea. I know. Oh, my gosh. Curled? My hair stopped being curly, Iike, around the time of, like, third grade. I mean, like really. Not like it used to be. It was crazy. I had a 'fro. My mom didn't want to- my mom never wanted to brush it, because I would scream at her. So when I got my first haircut, the lady's like, "Do you ever brush your hair??"' And my mom's like, "No." My hair used to be, like, this long. Sorry, man. We had to. Fuckers. Rob, I didn't throw any. It's okay. Come on. It was just a joke. Are you okay? Sort of. You know Janelle? Yeah. I'm visiting the party. Oh. Did you see that? No. What? Never mind. Come on in. We're gonna play a game. You have to get in the water. No, I don't. Is he naked? - I don't know. - Tell me if he is. I'm not getting in. I know you want to. Just go swim with him. I'm not swimming naked. You don't have to. Keep your suit on. - I don't know. - Just go. Are you okay? Another beer and I'll be fantastic. Ohh! Great. Do you want to swim over there? What happens over there? We talk. Only if you want to. I do. Hey, you couldn't do it either. No. What grade are you in? I'll be a junior on Monday. Freshman. I left my own party to come here tonight. That was your house? Yeah. My parents were gone. I just want to enjoy tonight, 'cause it's gonna be the last night of my life. I'm sorry. We're supposed to be at my friend's sleepover right now. But we ditched it for your party. Really? Yeah. I actually liked when my friends had sleepovers. Why? I don't know. I guess it's the kind of thing you miss when you're too old to do it anymore. I guess. Well, seriously. There's something to be said for all the cool stuff you get to do when you're a kid. You start showing up to keg parties and going skinny-dipping, you won't even remember how amazing it is to play a board game on the floor of your friend's living room. Or a game of tag in the backyard? Yeah. I miss tag. What grade are you in again? Sorry. You're sweet. I don't want you to buy into all the youthful adventure bullshit. Come on. What's wrong with that? It's a myth. A myth of what? Being a teenager. They trick you into giving up your childhood with all these promises of adventure. But once you realize what you lost, it's too late. You can't get it back. Can I hold your hand? Okay. It feels like it's gonna rain. Yeah, it does. Whoo! Yeah! They're having a drunken talent contest. Seriously? Yeah, and the winner gets a bottle of vodka. Is there a spirit in this house? Are there any ghosts in the house that can hear me? Wow. Spirit, why are you in this house? D-l-E-D H-E-R-E You died in this house? In my house? H-E-L-P M-E "Help me"? How? I don't want to help it. I want it to go away. Be quiet, or you'll piss it off. What do we have to do? Tell us. B-A-S-E-M-E-N Basement? Oh, shit. You want us to come down to the basement? I'm not going. You want two of us to visit you in the basement? I'm scared. Who? A-N-D-Y I'll do it. I don't think you should. Who else? C... L-A-U-D-l-A Claudia. Are you gonna do it? I'll go by myself if, uh, you're scared. No. I'll go too. Do you mind not standing on my sleeping bag? Oh, I'm sorry. Hi. Hi? Scott? Scott Holland? What are you doing here? I was nearby. I was just visiting friends over there at the dorms. Oh, really? What are you doing in here? I saw you and- Us? Both of you-outside. I saw you, and I thought I'd say hi. Well, it's nice to see you. It's a little strange seeing you in here, but it's still nice. Thanks. It's good to see you too. You too. It's good to see you two. What are you really doing in here? Like I said, I saw you, and I wanted to say hi. Really? Really, yeah. I'm just here visiting friends. I thought, "Hey, there's the Abbey twins. Maybe they'll want to hang out." Hang out? Yeah, like see the town. Hang out. I think we're gonna call it a night. Come on. Really? Yeah, really. Why don't we go for a little bit? We're not supposed to leave the gym. Who cares? They're watching doors. Now, that just makes it more fun. Do you think we're in trouble? - I doubt it. - We're fine. So how was the rest of high school for you guys? Um, good, I guess. Good. How about you? This is your last year of college, right? Yeah, but I don't think I'm going back to Chicago. You're not gonna finish? You're almost done. I don't know. I can't wait to be done with school. Four years. That's it. Yeah, I used to like it more, but- You cold? Yeah. Thanks. When do you have to meet up with your friends? Oh, there's no rush. Can I see your keychain? Why? It's the girl you slept with, right? Yeah. Let me see what she looks like. Okay. She's very pretty. She is. I never slept with her. I know. I could tell that you knew. That's why I'm telling you. Okay. You know, tonight is the best night of the year to see a meteor. I haven't seen a single one. You have to know how to look. How? Come here. You lay down with your feet pointed north. Now watch there, and eventually you'll see one. Have you found your supermarket girl? Not yet. You ever think about a person so much that you start to believe that they might know that you're thinking about them? When I was a kid, maybe. Tell me about it. I was about 1 0 or 1 1, I think, and I was on vacation with my friend John and his parents on Mackinac lsland. We saw these two girls riding past us on their bikes, so me and John followed them. We stayed about 50 feet behind them all afternoon until his dad found us and made us leave on the boat. We never said a word to them, but the girl that was mine kept looking at me and smiling. And for at least a week or two after that when I was going to sleep, I'd think about her and imagine that she knew how much I liked her. Did you ever see her again? No. She's like the girl from the supermarket. I got to go. Have fun. I hope you find her. It's actually kind of cold down here. Let's sit here. So you look over my shoulder and tell me if you see the ghost, and I'll do the same for you. I have to trust you? That's bad. I want to kiss you. But I can't. Have you ever breathed through another person before? What are you talking about? Breathing. Not kissing. No. Open your mouth. Lean in closer to me. Just relax. Let me do it. You're fucking horrible. You have to share this with me. I can't drink anymore. We'll have it for breakfast. Okay. You promise? Yeah. Breakfast. Have you seen Beth? - Your friend? - Yeah. I haven't seen her in a while. I'll be back, okay? I thought you might come here. It's kind of my last shot. You're being a dumb-ass, you know. This girl isn't just gonna disappear from the Earth when the sun comes up. Maybe she'll be in school. Or maybe she'll be at the parade. What if she's not? Oh, well. Shit. Bitch. That's not what I expected. What happened? It's nothing. Let me see. You cut yourself. It's fine. You should wash it out. I guess. Did you ever think that... What? Nothing. Hey, Jen. What the hell are you guys doing out here? I don't know. What are you doing? We're going to some tunnels one of the girls heard about. It's a make-out maze. Can we go? Um... Be careful, Ady. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you have any change on you? What, like a quarter? No, a penny. Splash! Was that a wish? Could be. I don't think swimming pools have the same magical effects as a wishing well. You don't know very much. Tell me if it works out for you. I will. You came here to see us, didn't you? Tell the truth. Yeah. Why? I remember this moment. I remember talking to you both and thinking that I liked you. You had a crush on me? No. Yeah. I mean, both of you. I... I had a crush on both of you. You can't like both of us. You were always together. We talked as a group. It's totally possible. We're not the same person. Even if we both liked you, we're not gonna triple date... Mnage twin... Whatever. I know. I know. What did you expect? Some kind of fantasy twin blow job? No, I didn't expect that, but... I'm sorry. I know this is weird. I've just been kind of a mess lately. And I saw this picture, and it reminded me of the fact that there might be someone else out there besides Kerri Sullivan who I like or have some kind of connection with. I'm not stalking you. Legally, I'm pretty sure I'm not. I just like you. And as fourth-grade as that sounds, it's the truth. Buy us some beer and we're cool. Okay. Hi. I hope you weren't taking advantage of my friend. No. Good, 'cause I was ready to beat the shit out of you. You probably could. Hi, Maggie. Hi, Beth. This is my new boyfriend. I see that. He's a good kisser. Is he? Yeah. You kissed her? I'll let you try him out if you want. I don't know about that. Come sit here. What happened to your face? I got hit. Why? I kissed another girl's boyfriend. You did? You breaking up with me? Probably. Did you know that Janelle Ramsey keeps a diary? Who the fuck wears Mickey Mouse underwear anyway? I'm sorry. Yeah. Do you want to come inside? No, I feel like running. Come on. If I spend the night, it doesn't mean that we're staying together. I know. Do you like me? What? Do you like Beth? Maggie, don't get weird. I think I just fucked up. Great. Beth. Wake up. We got to go. You guys want to hang out more? We could all go back to my house. Good luck. You too. Don't get lost. Hi. Hi. Do you want to sit with me? I actually have a girlfriend, so... Oh. I understand. I hope you find somebody to sit with you. Thanks. It's too bad you never said anything back then. Why? One of us had a big crush on you. One of you? Yeah, one of us. Well, which one of you liked me? Which one of us do you like? You can't say both. It's not fair. Well, what if it's true? Then we're not interested, no matter what. Okay. This is torture. Bathroom. Do you remember this moment? What about it? You said something crappy about Kerri, and I got kind of upset. I'm sure I didn't mean to upset you. I know. It just seemed like you were trying to tell me something, Iike you knew something about her that I didn't know. Oh, I don't remember. Sometimes I just spit things out. I'm pretty intuitive. It's the twin thing, I guess. What did your intuition tell you? She probably wasn't right for you. But you know that. I should've dated one of you. Do you know how many guys have pulled this twin fantasy bullshit? I really do like you. I don't get it. You're not a dumb person, but you just sound so stupid. You think sleeping with me and my sister would make you happy and solve all your problems. It might. Seriously, Ady, I like you. Both of us. No. I guess it's bedtime. It's the boy from the supermarket. Hi. You having fun here? Yeah. You? Sure. Want one? No, thanks. You were totally checking me out this afternoon. I love this place. What are you doing? It's so I can see you. You're not supposed to see what you're doing here. It's supposed to be dark. Sorry. You didn't do anything wrong. I mean for not- I'm sorry. Did you kiss anybody? Almost. Was she cute? Yeah, she was. Any luck? No. You know, we're gonna be the only freshmen who've never even kissed anybody. Oh, well. Yeah. So I guess you'll never know which one of us liked you, huh? I guess not. I'm glad you came to see us. Me too. Bye. Bye. Breakfast? Anna wanted me to give you her number. Thanks. Good luck figuring things out. Thanks. She wanted to know if you like her. She had the crush on me, right? Yeah. Well, tell her I like you both. And I'm sticking to it. Okay. I think you like me too. You'd just never admit it, right? I wouldn't admit it. Well, it was nice seeing you. Yeah. You're too good for Kerri Sullivan. Honestly. Thanks. Maybe I'll make it to Chicago someday. What makes you think I'll be there? I'm pretty intuitive. You're gonna be so tired in the morning. I know. I should get back before everybody wakes up. Do you want to go down it once? I'm drunk. Me too. Come on. I want to kiss you. How about when we get to the bottom? Let's go. What are you doing? I don't know. I don't want to kiss you. Oh. I mean, I do, but not right now. I like you, and... It's not like everything has to happen tonight. Okay. You go first. Did you find her? Yeah, I did. Did you see any meteors? It was too cloudy. Were you thinking about me when I was gone? No. I was. I knew it. I could tell you knew. That's why I was telling you, stupid.
