Both HIV tests were negative. - And hepatitis A, B, and C...? - No. You have chlamydia. That thought when I came last week... I see you've been prescribed a course of antibiotics. Means I'm cured, right? Well, have you followed the instructions? Two a day, no sex. Symptoms diminished? Your penis feels as if cold? How stuffy nose, sore throat? No! My penis feels much better, thanks. - Although we do not yet speak. - Have a question? Why not told me over the phone? Keep politics. That frightens patients. Well, it helps us to put people back and... can help the other party. The carrier. Well, actually it is not... - Accessible. - Through a friend, perhaps? If I could, I would believe me, Doctor. See, chlamydia can be difficult to detect in women. I know, the silent disease. I read on the Internet. - It's good to show interest. - It's not a hobby. If he contact with the carrier, as you call it, would do us a great service, her and us. Hey, I'll be honest with you. I had sex with a prostitute. It was my first and only time and... you know, was totally drunk. Ie, I know it's no excuse, but... I do not know what I do. Just... urinating strange things overnight as... The radiator or closet once. O on the computer. When I wake up in the morning, I remember nothing. To find a puddle around the house. Anyway, it was my bachelor party. Just a brothel and... You know, just hoping, because Jarvis... Jarvis is my godfather. He said there can be smoked. Just remember. - I'm surprised that I have stopped. - In your file says you're single.. Does your girlfriend...? That is, his fiancee, you know about all this? Do you plan to tell? No. In his search Internet did you read about the different incubation periods? Periods? What the...? Incubation periods, the time hidden disease testing. Why say that? You had unprotected sex with a sex worker. At high risk of new infections are facing, which can not be detected immediately. But I am cured. For a test to be 100% conclusive for diseases such elapse a certain amount of time. How long? Some 90 days. 19 days? 90 days! Twelve weeks if preferred. I prefer the shorter. 90 days, 12 weeks, 3 months. Three months. - We will be married before that. - I'm a dead man. Stay positive. Negative, stay negative. Look, we will resolve this soon. You and I... Taking and thinking. God! - Can not have sex with Lydia for 3 months? - Lower your voice! - What about oral sex? - No! With hand? Jerk off with her tits? Just curious, is all. And condoms are not a solution... After 6 years, is like a confession. So you just have the "abstinacin". - Abstinence! - Whatever you call those rare. We need to find out why they do it. Or do not? Is for religion. By religion, I know. You ask Lydia, Do you want to avoid sex for the wedding night... something special? Very deep you, Jarvis, but forget... I can not have sex or my wedding night. Do not know anyone who "close the deal" on the wedding night. I got this. Not in the mood or pull a smile, much less... What about the honeymoon? Do you also will be there? I have a room? I'm screwed! Tan fucked! Is stress! You stressed! Do not tell me? Stress what makes you? - Takes you to suicide? - Yes, yes, I know. And before that? I dunno. Threats, self-injury, attempted suicide. - Impotence! - Christ Look, Lydia's sex drive encourage her to try to cure me, but impotence is a problem... I do not got. 'd Better cut it. No. No, no. I do not mean cut it, but... What are you lock on the fly or something? I add a few days, but 3 months. I pour a cup of tea. I know! You put a piercing is infected and all, as Wayne's nose. Do you remember Wayne's nose? Toast was put out. Picture it in your nose. "Oh, do not come near me." I bet it would. Bet that dirty accept treatment. It's okay. Eureka! - Breaking your frenulum of the glans. - What? - Do not. The frenulum of the glans. - I do not know what it is. Jarvis, sit! I will below the table. Look, look, look. Ah, that. I met an old which broke in two. It was fucking a fat, leaning against a trash can and fell. Had dick in a sling for months. Cock in a sling? Who is the guy? How is it called? It's called... I think it starts with "P" P.... Do you know him? No, but the story is true. And even if it were not, the idea is very good. We should consider it. Chlamydia is like chickenpox. If the fuck is normally before 10 years. With other diseases, large, do not know anyone. Do not walk around bragging. Not a ban on transit. Is AIDS. What are the odds? Well, he said Dr. Cock, I had unprotected sex with a sex worker. Yes, but once. Likely 1,000 to 1, 100 to 1 maybe People make infidelities. 99% do not what you've done. I cleaned, researched, a clean job. Still, you feel guilty. That is, it is something terrible. Something very, very terrible. What do you think? Forget it. Acts as if nothing had happened. Turn that damn light. - Are you awake? - I'm asleep. I'm sorry. - What are you doing? - Hello. Kiss me. No, I have to get up early. I will fast. Know that rapid scalding me, no. - Is not it amazing? - No... centuries ago. Go brush your teeth. Go brush your teeth. Inside the toilet, Kyle In the toilet, Kyle Are you sure you're gonna be okay? - You sure. - I can not! I'm sorry. Mommy! I'm sorry. Thank you. Make Alfie go to the front. You get dizzy in the back seat. - Yes - Just like his uncle Kyle.. Come on, Alfie, a race to the car. You will be the co-pilot. You good with Alfie. Is a haven for pedophiles. You always have to think the worst? Yes, you have to be vigilant. Look at that man. Seems to be his father. And you can not have so many children. So go play with Alfie. I do not want them to think I'm a pedophile. Are you so paranoid? That shit happens! Nothing bad words! He can not speak. But when you learn, I do not want his first word is "shit." Maybe better than "pedophile". We shall not be well with our children. Yeah, you know. Let's take care of, right? Honey? Honey. Was thinking... Maybe... stopping the pill? A pregnancy can take up to 2 years. Look at Lee and Laura. If luckily we did immediately, will not be noticed before the wedding. 're Sweating. I do not know, is the Jalfrezi. That got me hot. Announce it would be amazing wedding. - Where's the waiter with my beer? - Kyle? Yes, it would be amazing, yes. You're right. Could take time. We'll have fun trying. I go to the bathroom. Thank you. I'm dying a cup of tea. Do you want one? Come on, shake me, Kyle! What? What? Kyle, my pussy is burning me. I burning pussy! Are you okay? What did you do to me? Not me. - I think it was the Jalfrezi. - It was your fucking hand. I'm sorry. Feels good. Feels great. Better than sex, huh? I leave you alone. - You say it was for you. - Yes, I will admit guilt. I'm sorry. Hope you do not get so late on your big day. I'm sorry. I will love you, I comfort you, honor and protect you and I'll be true as life has. - Here comes the part of the vote... - Now step rings. - Wait. - Sorry, do not want to ruin anything, is all. Sorry to interrupt. - I assume you are the future Mr. White.? - That's right. I think so. I understand that there is a small problem... With the DJ. Already was solved? My future husband will take care of that. Great, great. And... - Do you know how come vegans? - Vegans? - There will be four. - Four very well. Apology... - Duncan. - Hi. - Sorry. I'm the godfather. Can I apply a video projector? - Clear. - You can not show that! - You know how long it took me to edit? - Jarvis, my grandparents come. There will be kids there! Honestly do not see anything. Only pubis blurred. - Talk about that later. - Sorry for the interruption. No we decided on the flowers. No problem. If you are visiting this weekend, room will be decorated with lilies, Saturday, orchids and Sunday. Beautiful! Sounds good. Right, Kyle? This Weekend? I can not. Why? 'll Go fishing and Jarvis. Sport Fishing. - Fishing is our hobby. - It will be only for men. Work together five days a week. When you are married, will be all yours. - As long as you... - I'm pressuring, but I have a husband to look after, could we? - I'll see you this weekend. - Of course. Thank you. I appeal to those present, a witness that I, Lydia... - Ah, love! Are you okay? - Lydia. No, really, I'm fine. Do you know? Rather have a hamster... nipping the frenulum of the glans to spend the weekend sitting by a lake... In a fucking fish! Better get used to it, because I will be doing many times. Lydia already suspected my new interest in politics late at night. And I can not keep "helping" every night with the speech, even if you're dyslexic. I guess things are good contagindote. - What? - Nothing. What did you say? - You said I was dyslexic. - You are! - And you're good contagindote things. - Yeah, well... It would not have happened... godfather if my course I had not been to a brothel. - And you wanted. - I was drunk! - Me too! - I supposed you'd take care! You could not do a worse job! Look, Kyle, sorry. Kyle, mate, sorry! Are you at home. I'm asleep. Where is Jarvis? I know you're somewhere, Jarvis! Out, come out, wherever you are! What's the matter? How do I look? Angry. - I'm supposed to look sexy. That told me. - Who? 're Jealous. Drink some more and come to bed. Have no right to be jealous , Kyle White. I'm yours and I do not even want. I love you, Lydia. Do not tell me. Prove it. Fuck me or do something, please! I'm sorry. You better. - Why do you make me feel this way? - Not you. - I swear. - So what? - Preguntas? - No! - Because I do. - What? I said. I have doubts. And you know what? I'm glad I said. It's bad enough that I do not touch . I do not even talk. Can we talk, baby, still do. Let's Talk! Tell me you do not have doubts. I'm sure! But you doubt. I think is normal. Healthy, maybe. Is a very serious decision. Give up everything. And that of... A cock, a pussy, forever. Do you think that someday you might feel tempted? - Never. - We are human. Y makes mistakes. - Yes, I know, but... - Look how many divorces and infidelities, anywhere. I think so, yes. Do you think you can be unfaithful still being very much in love? I do not know. You've been unfaithful? I can not lie to that face. Sure you can. Just rehearse.

I'll give a little imagination, be creative. Do you understand? You tricked me? I swear, for our unborn children , I have never cheated. I'll get a glass of water. It's okay. Did you ever consider a gas grill, Kyle? No, coal are more efficient. Right, son? Yes, they are very good. Calls on your wedding list. - Are expensive, right? - I do not know. Anyone can afford. Kyle? Would you show your van Alfie? Says you killed a rhino with her. I did not say that. I said I could do it. - Are you telling him shit! - Exactly. Were in the petting zoo. He got scared with the large animals. The van is falling apart. Do not kill even a cow, less a fucking rhino. - What would you have said? It depends on what you tell him. The rhino was white or black? What does that matter? Can not kill one black. Right. If I remember correctly, are the species most endangered. No, not that. Is racist. Racist. Hey, Alfie! Already they decided with flowers? Yes, Mom and I chose lilies. Good. - Still the same beautician. - Yes! When men go to the last appointment with the tailor? Are on the calendar. My outfit was not me the day of my wedding. No, honey, I left much fat before the wedding. Stress. Was that. Seems that Kyle has lost weight. Is stress, for sure! Do not know how it is, folks! Yes, it's true. You must stand in front of all those people , Say wise things about the joy of being married, and then go to the master suite, where expect the performance of your life. That does not take away my sleep. I alone. 'll Go check on the boys. So a person thinks a verb, and the others try to guess asking questions. But the question must replace verb for the word "tea". - Tea? - With that word you substitute the verb in the sentence. Better play poker? God, Michael! It will be fun! A small demonstration, right? 'm Thinking of a verb. Questions should be me. And if they are wrong, must have a drink. We are no longer in school. I start. Thou "tetereas" every day? - Yes, I "tetereo" every day. - Like "teterear"? Yes, I love "teterear". See? The verb should be conjugated. - You "tetereas" alone? - Good question! Yes, I "tetereo" alone. Do you have a question, Mic? Yeah yeah. I have a. - Where do you keep the "teapot"? - Drink! Maybe I did not explained me well. The word is a verb. - Better leave him out. - Yeah, yeah. - Forget swallow. - No, no. Okay, okay. I have another question. The "teapot", what color is it? Is a verb, dad, as eating or walking. - Cagada - That's a noun! No, okay. "She shits"! "She shits" is a verb. He does it every day. Solito, enjoy it. I have a question, Roger. Do you read the newspaper...? While you have a "teapot"? Ha! Bravo! Well done, Michael! I understand, you see? Well done. Shitting? Read! The verb is read. - I'm good at this. Who's next? - Yo! When "teterea" people? "Tetereas" at any time, night or day. How long does a "tetereo"? Depends. Can last a few hours or more. What feels "teterear"? Depends, can be good or bad, until satisfactory. But it can be boring. Almost always, is a natural act. Do you have to learn to "teterear"? Yeah yeah. I'll give you a hint. You taught me everything I know about "teterear". You and Kyle "teterean" together? Not recently. In fact, we have no "tetereado" in a while. - Like "teterear"? - I love "teterear". I love. Hopefully "tetereramos" more often. Do men think more "teterear" than women? Definitely. Men think it every 3 seconds? I think some do. I think I got it! Fuck! That's the verb, right? No, it's not fucking. Honey, it's getting late. You should go home. Me back with you. What did you say, honey? I have a meeting in the morning. I have to get up early. - 'll Walk from home. - I thought you said. No problem, Mom and Dad? - Both are always welcome! - Kyle has to work. Just pick a few things. What is this meeting? - You left them alone again. - Yes, I left. You leave me alone. - Voice down. - Is that what this is about? Do not make me mourn. Kyle We're leaving, love Go and Tend. Send them away, please! Go and Tend, seriously! 'll Call you tomorrow. Lydia. Lydia! The word was "fish", right? Yes. Hi, this is Lydia. . Thanks for calling Leave your name and number I will answer as soon as I can Thanks, bye .. Where are you, motherfucker? I'm going to kill myself. - Kyle - I hate myself? I hate you more if you commit suicide. Lydia sent me a text saying he needs time. Listen, friend Sarah, Amy, Leanne. All said the same shit. But they all left. Suicide is not the answer, Is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. - AIDS is a continuing problem. - You do not have AIDS I feel as if I did. Everyone says I've lost weight, and... I'm cold since went fishing. Kyle, you can overcome it. Why? That is, life ends in total disaster, forever. Prison, divorce, suicide, homelessness... Look at your family. Do not do personal friend. - Seriously, can not stand feeling this way. - Okay, I'm coming. Fucking wanker! - What? - No, not you, friend. Are you okay? 'm A wanker. I pajear eternally now I have AIDS. Marica! Yes 'm A horrible fag. Look, I can not talk now, friend Kyle. Are you peeing? Jarvis Jarvis Jarvis, are you there? You tell me why I sent stop. Belt, mobile phone, return "U". I see no belt. No, but I'm very honest. So you must believe me when I tell you... I lead an exceptional hurry. I do not care if it's life or death. - It is. - Do not be funny. No, I'm serious. My friend is going to commit suicide. What friend is that? With the speaker phone. You can talk to him if you want. - If me you're kidding... - Jarvis, are you there Hello, this is Officer Walker? Who is this, please? - What the fuck? - I think he's taken. Again, your name, please. Who fucked you? Kyle, do not be a moron! Kyle Walker says the official. Your friend Mr.... Jarvis. Mr. Jarvis argues in its defense a litany of traffic violations, you is about to commit suicide.. Is that correct? - I said I was thinking. - Fuck me, Kyle! You just say you're going to kill yourself! It's okay. Then I'll kill myself! Kyle, calm down! As a police officer, my duty is to take that threat... Seriously. Threat against a person, including yourself , is a criminal offense. Have fun dragging my carcass to court. Where you are, please? Do you have a pen, officer? Yes I Get that up your ass! - Your address, please. - 61 Maple Avenue. - Cursed snitch, Jarvis! - Do not hang up. Kyle... Are you satisfied, Jarvis? It's all your damn fault! Sorry, Kyle. Suicide in Progress . Answer the damn phone! Kyle! Fuck! Where the hell are you? Damn! Kyle, no, no! Fuck no! Cursed criminal! You're the criminal. I almost arrested for you! I should kill you! - I love you, man! - I love you, man. Do not ever do this again. Who uses that purple dildo? Let's finish this... Now. Prostitute three months. What if you postpone the wedding? Any idea what it costs Wedding? It's amazing that we did not think before. Because it is more painful than break the frenulum of the glans. Is it more painful to lose life or a couple of fingers? - Who said anything about fingers? - Toast the wedding. Come to my office. That will give me tetanus! Are you worried about tetanus? Thought you had AIDS. Total, has no edge. - I do not mind waiting. - Do I have to wait? You can not do it alone. No good. Total, you sew fingers in a heartbeat. - You will leave in a couple of days. - I will not cut your hands! Fagot coward! Can not be something less severe, as an overdose? That looks like a suicide. The only more fag, suicide is a suicide attempt. If you look closely, is a declaration of love. What if I make a tattoo? I do not want to bleed to death. Do not bleed to death. Only you are going to faint. O you will fall into a coma. A comma sounds good. A coma. How do you induce a coma? Certainly are not alone. The world is full of desperate wretches. Dreaming into a coma to escape the misery... life. Yes, but how is it done? Risky Luce. A thin line between... coma death. Click on this. Pajate into a coma. That I'm not going to help. Fucking Internet. I just need something to get me out of circulation... for a few weeks. Something that does not kill you, Doctors and that fixed easily. Exactly. Can burn. What? Skin grafts taken forever. Do you remember Neil? - In the accident with artificial fires ? - Ah, yes. Took pieces of ass... and stuck them in the face. Neil "ass face". - That was unfair. - It was! A face fucking ass! It became traumatized. You are sick in the head. Can burn, it tonight. We use fire. A good burned with fire! Use gas heater. Does not matter. You burn... With boiling water. If we do not fire, boiling water miss you. All right. You're cooking. - What? - You're cooking. - Yes, cooking what? Pasta, potatoes, whatever. All right. You took a few shots, you bend over to pick something up, bump into the handle of the pan... and the water is spilled you in the head. No, anywhere but the head. - Then on your back. - Yes Kyle "Back of ass".. Listen, I'll wait in the other room. And when you hear... I'll call... Do you really want to? Have to. Must be another way. There is not. Lydia only knew how much you loved her. Better not put this in your speech. I do not wear it. I do not wear it. Kyle! Wait, wait! It occurred to me something good! Check this out! We can not make exams before the wedding, because 10 weeks is not enough. What if we look at it? To whom? A sex worker with whom you had unprotected intercourse. Stop describe it well. No, if examined and cleaned out, means that you are clean. Do not be a contamination AIDS from someone who does not. Look at me. Look back to the brothel, find the carrier, and we do an AIDS test. How do we find the place? Asking. To whom? Tourist Information do not guide to brothels. We cross our path. Easier said than I do. We had a few drinks in the hotel bar. Aha. Then we went to a pub. A cheap place. A few more drinks. I know. We went to the Internet and look massage parlors in Newcastle. We search Google. That will be a big hassle. "Newcastle brothel". No! I did wrong. Massage. That's it. El Santuario... Bubbles... "Foxy Break Knights". I like it as it sounds. - It will take an eternity. - We can not, take a virtual tour... from brothels. Watch" Visit our oasis of mad passion." Lower your voice! Experienced ladies that will fulfill all your cravings. Shut up! Look at the photos. Was she blonde or brunette? It was not blonde. What do you remember accurately? Was pretty... Robusta. - Gorda. - No, like... voluptuous. Gorda. - I think he had a tattoo. - A big tattoo. Here. We have two blondes, too skinny. We write down the address and explored. Do you have a pen? Not Here in the van. It's okay. Where is the printer? You can not print that! Someone is printing? You a complete idiot! Someone is printing? Then say something. - I have someone document. - Say something, damn it! Is printing a document. - Is someone? - Yes! Pajero. Are two sailing pounds and 25 per page.
