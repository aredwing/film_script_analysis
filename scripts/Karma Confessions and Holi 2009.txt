And you.. -What are the ladies talking? -Come, come. Where is my tea, sweetheart? -l have kept it on the counter. -Ok. By the way, Vikram was getting bored so l engaged him.. ..with the computer. -You did the right thing. He doesn't talk much. Anyways, what's more interesting to a teenager than porn-surfing?

Oh, so you're a doctor? -Yes, doctor of politics. When he's not running the clinic, he runs the city. He's got the habit of kidding. Well, the ladies are in the kitchen, if you please to go.. ..Oh! Just like an lndian party. Men out and women in the kitchen. -You're taunting, now. So, Nimesh, welcome home! Hi! l'm Sujata. Dr. Nimesh's wife. Oh! Hi, nice to meet you.

Maybe l'll lose my job on Monday. l haven't been on a date since a year and my cat has left. And the rest.. Are you drunk? -l'm fine. Well, Megan, this is Geetanjali. We call her Jee, Megan. Hi! -This is Meera. -l've heard a lot about you. You've met Meera already. Meera, your house is really pretty like Taj Mahal. Oh! l've got something for you. Where did l keep it? Oh! Here it is! Seems like you made it. Thank you! Wow, thank you so much. lsn't it beautiful, Meg? Yes, it's beautiful. Wow! Can we go inside? Thanks! Like you've been made.. ..for me. -So here you are! -Hi! Oh my God! Congratulations, Javed! Finally, your efforts bore fruit. Dev, how are you? -Very well. Did you start your job? -Yes. l'll introduce you to the ladies. This is Geetanjali. She works with me. -l'm his slave. -This is my sister, Vani. He's a great friend of mine. -Mr. Hollywood? Yeah, he's going to start off with his first film. C'mon, talk about it. This is your first film after 10 yrs. lt's such a great news. -This is the beautiful? -Jennifer. Hi, Jennifer. -How are you doing? -She's so beautiful. Are you an actress? -Yes, she is. She's a very good actress. -ls she the heroine in your film? Well, l've found something good.. -No, l'm just a girlfriend. Oh! Well.. -That's great! Lucky guy! You're really a lucky guy! Good times! Good times! Good times! Good times! Life's like this. Laugh a little. C'mon, there's only some time left. lsha will reach anytime. l'm sorry. l'm a little tensed since a few days. Tell me, who's not? By the way, do l look tensed? Don't seem to. l'm not talking about work. You know about my personal life. lt's going to be a year, now. -l know. l'm ill-fated since childhood. Maybe, l'm goin through all this because l broke that guy's.. ..heart in third standard. Come here! -What happened? -Check that out. She's getting on him for a promotion, isn't it? No, l promise. lt's nothing like that. They're just good friends. Maybe, they don't hold anything now but this is how it starts. Okay, then, l'll keep an eye on them, henceforth. Hey! Now, let's go inside and talk. Did you tell her? She runs my house and supported me throughout. You're just bothered about your magazine and everybody's support. Blah, blah, blah! Tell her everything, Dev! You're lucky that you got her. -l know! But her sister seems to be different. -Don't bother that! Have you seen Javed? -He must be around. Do you know about tarot cards? Since how many years have you been reading them? lt's been long. -Sorry, l'm Jennifer. Megan. You've come with Javed. -Yes, with him and you? With my cards. Jennifer tell me one thing, should l take this off? Yes, even l felt so. Oh God! l'm having a bad mood today. l mean.. ..l didn't want to come here. l just came to support him and he's missing. Javed is like this. Should l tell you something about yourself? -Why not? l'm afraid but, sure. lt's better than sitting idle. What are you doing, now? Did l scare you? -No, stop this! Okay. -Please! You know what? l know these American guys well. What do you think of them? l've heard that these people take drugs, party every night.. ..and enjoy with girls. Well, how did you get to know about this? This is what happens in American TV. l know everything. -This means that you.. ..have rid.. ..big elephants and your dad deals with it. No, how did you come across this? -By our TV. Do you have a girlfriend? -No! l don't have a girlfriend. So, you're a virgin? -What!? No! Why are you asking? -Have you ever kissed a girl? l've done it many times. -Oh, okay! -Vikram! Well, what have you got to do with it? -Fine, sorry. Mom's calling. -Okay! So you're a big filmmaker? Well, won't call it big but then yes, l make films. How many films have you made till date? -Well.. This will be my first film. And he's made some documentaries.. -Two of them! They're really good, brother-in-law. How many years have you spent doing this? 10 yrs. -Oh, 10 yrs? This is one thing l don't understand about this field! We make furniture and if l take 10 yrs to make a table, then.. ..my family will die out of starvation. Well, l'm lucky not to have a family. So, no one remains hungry. By the way, making a film will be really difficult. Much difficult that making tables. -Agreed! Nothing's difficult! 10 yrs is too much to make a film. Are you making a Mughal-E-Azam, brother? lt's just a matter of money, nothing more is needed! So are you an actress? -Yes, a struggling actress. Yes, l've learnt acting from Loyalo Marimon. Sorry, what? University, darling. She's talking about university. Oh, university! Even l wanted to join one. l was telling him if l could join next year.. -This is good. Absolutely, you must go. l think it's great! l think it's a bad idea. What will you do there? -What will she do? What will she do in a university -She's got everything. And even after having everything, she wants to join college. Of course! This is her own choice. ls it? This choice is a stupid feminism talk. Feminism and choice, how do you connect them? And this is Vikram. Say hi, Vikram. l have to go. And that was Vikram, ladies and gentleman. What's going on? -Who? -No, no. Who? What are you talking about? -She! She's just a friend, nothing more. -Really? Don't you like her? -As far as l know, she's an actress. And she's working in my film. And till then, you're taking advantage as a director. Then what? Should l introduce her to my mom? lf she collapses due to shock.. ..then there's no question of marriage. Yes, but you like her.. Hey, Jennifer, are you alright? -ls your health fine? What's wrong? -Can l go to the bathroom, please? -Of course! l'll come along. -You sit. l'll take her. Come, come, my dear. What happened? Don't know what's wrong! -Not bad, Preeti! Wow! Anything more? l have seen your past, your karmic relations.. ..now let's see your future. -Yes, yes. -Okay. The mortality card. -Mortality? lt's good, don't worry! lt's feeling good. What are you applying? lt's very easy. A little turmeric in mustard oil.. ..and salt to boil it and you'll be healed in two hours. Wow! Very good! The same pain, again? -Yes, it's better now. We should keep someone like her as well. What happened? Why is your face swollen? You know, Preeti, is troubling Vikram. You've started off again. Why do you hate everybody? Preeti, you're doing great! Really? l mean.. it feels so good. i came here and now Javed's giving me a role in his film. You too? Wow! -l feel so happy! -When is my turn? You keep this, please? Preeti, what are you doing? We're in a party! But this is your business. Please! Preeti, do give your film's premier passes. Okay. -That would be enough for me. Thanks, thank you so much. -You're very welcome. -Bye! -Bye! Look, Shekhar, l'm not like you. How can l deny something happening in front of my eyes? Did you get your pressure checked? Can't you even answer me straight? Tell me, Shekhar! Just a minute. -No, no. Why are you making me sin? Else l'll sin. Keep this! Thank you. Go! -Wow! Vani, you need rest and l think.. ..even we should hire someone like this? This, Hasan sir, how did he.. Don't ask anything. This man's very important for my magazine. No, you were supposed to invite family, Dev! -Understand! Dev! lshata! lt's such a pleasure! -Well, Dev! This is my friend, Cooky. l was just telling her that we would enjoy with some friends. Her shopping and make-up consumed a lot of time. lsn't she beautiful? -Yeah. -lt's that when.. ..she came out dressed, l couldn't believe my eyes. Who is this, lovely lady? lsha, my wife, Meera. Hi! -Oh, is she your wife? -l'm Cooky! What a lovely name! What a lovely name! When you said that there's going.. ..to be an lndian party at your place. Then, l thought that there'll be campfire and songs. Don't get me wrong. l can see that you've build a great home and earned a lot. Mrs, Me and lshata will have a business talk. Why don't you take Cooky inside and introduce her to others. Why not? Cooky, come along with me. l love lndians. How strange, isn't it? And lndian food is beyond words. Really? Come tell me more about it. No, no, no. l won't speak now. Jennifer, wait, listen to me. -Leave me alone, Javed. - Don't close the door. Listen! Don't ask me anything, selfish! You think that l'm around you because l want to work.. ..in your film. This is not true! You don't have a film, Javed. You don't have a film. You're constantly, constantly.. ..making a fool out of others. You don't possess the talent that you talk of. You keep lying! You keep telling people that you have a big film. Don't l know.. ..the truth. l've known you since long. -What are you saying? What do you know? -You think you're a great director, is it? How do you behave with me? And l just wished good for you that all your dreams came true. That you become a great director. But you don't wish good for me. You.. ..you're selfish. -But what have l done? l care for you and your dreams. l wanted to support you. What? So, you were pretending to support me? l used to pretend because l didn't want to disappoint you. l just want honesty from you, that, you remain honest. l don't want you to pretend as if you're my.. ..girlfriend and supporting me. What has happened to you? l've done so much for you. What is it that you're expecting from me? Look, don't hide from me. What's the matter? l want you to understand the responsibility of a father! What do you mean? -l'm pregnant. Look, l knew that this would be your reaction. No! lsha, this is Geetanjali Singh. She's also going to be present in our meeting, today. Oh! l thought that we would talk alone, today. But when a beautiful.. ..flower is present, then there are no hassles. l'm the company's chief operating officer and l've done my BA. And my MBA from Harvard. Oh, l'm sorry darling. Don't feel bad! -Relax. l was joking. She got irritated. Personally, l love Las Vegas. lt's fun there but l always lose. l'm never able to save money. l always return rich from there. Then, maybe, l don't know how to play. l've been there a few times. Feels good! -Have you been? -Yes. Yes, there are good restaurants. Good clubs also. -Yes, very true. Whenever l visit lndia, l go to Kashmir, it's a beautiful place. l love lndia. -l think America's better. lt's the most beautiful place in the world. l love lndia but l just wish it had been as beautiful as America. l think you must visit lndia. You must be proud to be an lndian. -Well.. What will l do there? l heard that some ltalian was asked to rule lndia.. ..and he had refused it. -Yes. What happened? -Nothing, Vani. Excuse me, please. -Where are you going, then? l would want to go to the bathroom, if you permit! lf you feel scared, can l come along too? lf you come along, then l shall be scared for sure. Truly, l think lndia's views has become so modern.. ..that it is ready to accept a lady foreigner as a leader. Rightly said, even l'm impressed with this. And how many nations had an lndian prime minister? l've never heard anything more stupid than this. C'mon, your nation has a population of 100 crores. But, you can't appoint a good leader. But he is an lndian, Nimesh. And maybe you're too conservative regarding this. You do a thing.. ..go and make me a cup of tea. So are you.. So you stay in Vegas. What do you do there? l entertain people. What kind of entertainment? l love being entertained, anywhere.. ..anytime. Everyone gets entertained. With such funds.. ..we can gets new stuff. Exclusive stories.. ..nice glossy paper, layout, everything. Our circulation will increase, you know? -Yes. Your ideas seem to be good. And you need twenty lakhs for your next edition. And later, twenty more lakhs. For your next edition. -Well, maybe.. ..we won't need the extra twenty lakhs. Right? -Listen to me, whether you need it or not.. ..but l'm concerned about my interest. Well, you've got a point. You've got a point. l'm just worried about one thing. This.. You call this the lndian Voice. l mean, nobody will.. ..buy this easily. Well, this is just our.. ..community's voice. Shall l tell you something? l've come to do business here. Not charity or something, do you get me, partner? Stopping this publication is not a big deal, Mr. lsha! Then we can think about it. Shekhar, is your stomach alright? -Yes, dear. How many times have l told you to drink water after food? Can you please leave me alone? -l'm tensed about you, Shekhar. About you and your stomach. l know it. l know that you're worried but can l shit in peace? Please! So, lsha. What do you say? lt's a deal. Thank you so much, lsha. Congratulations! -You too, young lady. Thank you, thank you. Well.. Cheers to that! -Oh, definitely! Wait a minute, Cooky. You don't sleep with these men, do you? Oh, not at all, darling. l thought. Know what? Bobby has bought me my new Mercedes. And my job is to sit on his lap.. ..and do a few movements. Even l like it a lot. He's so crazy, isn't he? Where are we stuck? You've worn such a beautiful curtain. Curtain? She's never seen such clothes. -What is she wearing to speak so. Don't know from where Meera gets such girls. They're speaking some different language. -Yes, it is different. Her head is full of nonsense. lt's a different language. -Yes, yes, l'll just show it to you. Just wait. -Sister, where are you going? -Wow, Meera, wow! What guests you've invited! -Cooky! -Shut up! Meera, l know that your lifestyle is very modern. But why have you invited her? l mean.. What sort of people are these? -But what? Do whatever you want to with your life. lt's yours! But, sister. Sister! lt's her. -What? -Cooky! But what has Cooky done? -Don't you know, Cooky? She told me that she takes 4000$.. ..for one night. Are you alright? -Yes, l'm fine. Take this wine. Okay, l remembered some work. Bye! Dev! How many times have l told you not to smoke in the house? Oh, l'm really sorry. Here. -Listen, don't flatter me. l don't like these business meetings at home. We've finished with our meeting. lt's done! And you've got a prostitute in my house and l don't like that! Meera! Well.. l can't wait here anymore. Sorry, Mr. lsha. -lsha! There's definitely some misunderstanding. Please! -Dev! You offered great hospitality. C'mon, Cooky. We're leaving!

Let's ask Nimesh. l'll not ask for a loan from him. ls there any other choice? C'mon! Let's go inside. And, yes.. ..don't say anything to Meera. Everything's become a mess. Don't know whom to blame. On the newspaper.. ..on Meera or my fate. lt's good that we didn't get lsha's money. What are you trying to say? l'm doing all this with a fore thought. Newspaper, for me, is not only a.. ..medium of earning money. Without the newspaper.. ..everything will make no sense. lf you need any reference or.. ..anything. l'm there! Okay! Dev, let me remind you that we have guests at home today. So, if you're done with your business talks. Then we can go in and attend to the guests. l'm sorry. Keep your mouth shut, it's an important call. lt's his baby's call. Hey, baby. What's up? How are you doing? What did you say? No, l'm at home. l'm in the tub.. l swear on you. lt's just the TV making noise, nothing else. That's nothing just that the soap slips out of my hand. No, no. l'll just take bath and.. ..l'll talk to you till my heart's content, isn't it baby? Yeah, honey. l love you too. Alright! Bye! Good! Hey! Bloody, he's shooting me. All of you get inside. l'll get hold of him. Go! What are you waiting for? Go inside! l'll kill him! Hey Dev! Where did you send Cooky? l just saw her going. He had to reach somewhere. lsha also had some work. So.. Are you okay? -Kamala, please get a glass of water. Yes, l have one near me. Take it! Take it! You won't take it because l served it? l've always been made to feel that because l'm a Muslim. Look, Javed, let me tell you one thing clearly. l don't drink water from a person who.. ls a Muslim! -You shouldn't be saying this. -No, no, no. lt's okay. Let her speak out. She can. l'm sorry, man. -lt's alright! lt's a big, happy family. Okay, hello everyone. Has anybody died? -Brother-in-law! Dev, your toilet flush is not working. No, it's okay, l'll mend it. You'll need a rod for it. -No, it's okay. l'll mend it. Anybody can need it. There are so many guests. -l don't know where l'll get rod but.. ..l'll find it and fix it. -Okay, he'll fix it. l saw a hardware shop while coming.. ..l'll get it. Anyways, l want to go out. There's a store 4 blocks ahead of 25th avenue, to the left. Oh excellent! So, doctor, why don't you go along with him? He's not an infant to seek some help from me. -C'mon! l think, even you should go. Look! -Alright! The ladies don't want me to stay here. Even l'll have a ride. -Meera! Will you do me a favour? Just take care of Jennifer after l leave. l hope she doesn't have to tackle religious issues. Did you say anything? l'm sorry, Javed. Okay, let's do a thing.. Let's all take a drink. C'mon, hurry up! Come, come! Richard! Why are you distracting me? Let me think, let me think! How does it make a difference whether someone's a Muslim.. ..or not. -What's wrong in being a Muslim? l don't see any problem. Why are we arguing? Why do you get so upset when there's a talk about Muslims? Because l'm a Muslim. -l know that, l do! Good, then why are you talking about it? Forget all this. Let's find the rod! Go and listen to what they're talking. -No, l won't go. -Go! l don't have the energy to make you understand. lt's such a silly thing. l was giving her water and she refused to take it. l had seen that, Javed. -l'm not ill. -l know you, Javed! But there are many old people like Vani, who are old-school. Right. -And there's no cure to this. lf there's some grave problem in America. lt's the issue of terrorism. What? -l'm a filmmaker, not a terrorist. Not why are you yelling at me? When did l say that you're not a filmmaker but a terrorist? l'm just trying to make you understand. Now forget this argument! And let's leave this place! -Here, l got it! ls this the one? Check out! -Here, take it! C'mon, let's go! You offend me, friend. Why? What did l say? You very well know to twist tales. There's politics.. ..behind all this. Whether it's bush.. -You're right! Had Bush or America not steeped on our.. -No, no! There would've been no problem. -You're not getting me. There would've been no terrorist. -Look, behind this.. ..there's a big hand. lt's a chance for Bush.. ..to trespass Middle-East. -Should l pay? No, l have it! Thank you. Thank you! When did l say that you don't have. -Thanks for asking, friend. Just a second. Come here! l need to ask you something. -What's up? Do you have any ld? -Yes, sure. l'll show it to you. Why do you need an lD? Because, after hearing you people speak.. ..l had a doubt, so.. l need you lD! -Look! l won't show you my lD! You're forcing me. Don't compel me to.. Show me you lD! -No, no. C'mon, right away! -No! Move back! What are you doing? -You can't do this to me. Look, l'm the member of the Chamber of Commerce.

Tomorrow is the festival of Holi. l will celebrate every feeling of my life. That every feeling which l lived. Happiness, sorrow, beauty, everything!

But if you people don't wish to hear. Then l'll stay put. No, no, we want to listen to it. Maybe even Meera will confess something after you. Why not?! We all will share talks which has been.. ..a secret till date. -Wait, wait! You're saying so much even after all this. C'mon Dev! Comply to it! -l know, l know, let's play truth and dare! Oh!

Okay. -Please! -Okay! l was 15 years old.. We used to live in a middle class colony in Delhi and there.. ..used to be a very beautiful girl in my neighbourhood. All the kids used to like her a lot and one day. One day, she asked me to play a game with her. lt was a kissing game. And l won the kiss. And she taught me how to kiss. l'm not preaching philosophy but.. Don't you think such experiences.. ..will enhance Vikram's confidence. Yes, Dev, it was a good one for you! The first kiss of yours! -Well, it wasn't my first kiss. lt wasn't his first kiss! -Let's end his chance now, please. Now, someone else turn the bottle please. l don't want to speak all night. -Okay, turn the bottle. Okay, turn the bottle. -Let's see who's next. Okay, Dr. Nimesh. No, no, not me! -No, it's facing you. lt's alright. Speak it out! Alright, if you say so. This dates back when l was a student.. ..in the Atlanta medical college. So, it's a pretty old incident. -Oh! Thank you. Anyway, there was a professor in my neighbourhood. He was old but his wife was young and beautiful. She was as beautiful as an angel. l'm telling you, man. l just found reason to visit their place. You know, l just barged in. l started feeling that his wife started loving me. The lust was mutual. -Alright! One night, the professor went out. So l.. ..wore my best shirt. l mean, that was the sole clean one that l had. l went straight to their house. Knocked and went inside. Before l could make out, l was in the bedroom. l felt that my life was blessed! -Okay, okay. -What? So, you got all that you went for. Next! -Wait, listen to me. We were in the bed in each other's arms and suddenly.. ..the door opened and the old professor was back. Oh yeah! -He was climbing up the stairs and any moment.. ..could've reached the room. -Did you go under the bed? How do you know? Were you there? -No, no, l was just guessing. l hid under the bed and the story doesn't end here. That old professor wasn't back for some work.. The both of them, were, engrossed for hours. We were under the bed, the whole night. Oh! Doctor, we feel so bad for you. lt was a horrible experience for me. Anyway, my turn's over. Oh! Sujata! -Okay. lt is that.. lt dates back to. -Wait, wait. You don't have any secret. -What's that? Let her speak! C'mon, Sujata, we're listening. No, it's alright. l don't have any secrets. -Oh, c'mon! No, no. -See, she doesn't have any secrets. Okay, let's turn it again. Who's it? Who's it? Okay, l'll tell you. l never got anybody's love. l tried my level best to cope up with men. But l could never make it. Don't know why! l thought l chose the wrong men. Then l thought, maybe.. ..the men l chose had problems in them. Oh! So she prefers girls. -No! Now, who's turn is it? Meera! -Oh no! -lt's be fun, now! Well, l don't know whether.. ..it's a secret or confession. Dev and me are trying for a kid since long. Meera! -Dev, let her speak. And l started worrying. Because it was already a year.. ..which is enough to conceive. And l felt that.. ..there must be some problem in my family. That's why l.. But l don't know. l don't think that.. ..l.. Doctors said that. -Doctors? So you consulted the doctors? Yes, l did. They will conduct a few more tests and.. This is silly! l shouldn't have started off.. Who's turn is it next? -Take this! -C'mon guys! Thanks, brother-in-law. -Just a minute. My sari, lt's fine. lt's Shekhar's turn. l want to confess something. lt's been twenty-four years of our marriage. We shifted to our bungalow after 6 yrs of our marriage. But l lost my job. l tried my best to get a new job. But l didn't get one.. -You were depressed and.. Vani, let me tell. Suddenly, my father fell ill in the village. And he was in need of money. We didn't have money. We shifted to a smaller house but.. Our cash and.. and gold were robbed. You know! Vani.. l had stolen everything. And l sold everything. l sold everything for money, Vani. l'm ashamed! l'm sorry, Vani. l will complete Shekhar's story. He lost his job. And he got addicted to alcohol. l used to do all his work. Because, he had the male ego. l used to get tired and broken. Nobody, knew what tomorrow held for us. Then.. One day, l got to know that l'm pregnant. What are you saying? You lied to me! l always wanted a child. l always wanted a child. You're a killer, Vani. l spent my life with a killer.
