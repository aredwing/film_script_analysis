We'll go back tomorrow. No, I can't think of anything. Is Mint around? She asked dad to buy stuff. But he cannot find it. Go get Mint, will you? Som Yes? Go get Mint, will you? Yes. Mint, Dad wants to talk. Mint. What? Dad wants to talk to you. Is that my shirt? Mom told me you don't wear it. It doesn't mean someone else can wear it. Got that? Hello. Mint? Yes, dad. Did you find it? I'm trying. I can't find it anywhere. "Come on, Dad. Please try harder. My friend said you can find at that place." May. I have a meeting with Lin. Hello. Hi May, we got a lot this time. Wow. Why don't you cut your hair? I think you'll look hot in short hair. I'd rather not. Oh, right. It took quite a while to be this long. You must really love your hair. Can you wait for me here? Ok. I'll go get the money. Sure. I'll buy it. Yes. Take care of your sister and store. I know. She's grown up. She can handle by herself. I got to go. Take care of May while we're here, okay? Go, Lazy. Buying and grooming other people's hair. Be careful. What's wrong with you? I make wig for patients. Only if you want to help me. You're a saint. Give me back my shirt. Go away, Lazy. Go to your master. Go! Hi. Yes? Here. Ok. This time they are so beautiful. Thanks a lot. Alright, I have to go. Bye. "Hanging on the wall... a broken neck" Hello. What? Are you guys there already? I'm about to go out now. Alright. Hang on. Be late. Do not lock the door. Mint, which way are you going? Thonglor. Can I go with you? Goodbye, May. Hurry. Hang on. "Mom gives you a New Year bonus. Thanks a lot. I'll go now." Mint? Holy crap! You scare me. What are you playing? Why are you here? Cheers! Cheers! Bottom up! Bottom up! Ok. Because I'm here at a wig store. I want to tell you a ghost story about wig. My friend got hair extensions. First night, nothing happened. But in the second night... My friend bought a shampoo, strawberry essence. "When washing your hair, it supposed to smell like strawberry, right?" But my friend smelt something else... Smell like a rotten thing. It's stink. Like something's dead. And worse part is... Suddenly the hair flew by the wind. And then they caught my eyes. I was annoyed, so I brushed them off. And when I opened my eyes. I... Saw... I saw... saw... Shit! What's wrong with you? I haven't told you a highlight. Beer ran out. Bitch! I second that, bitch! I hope you fall down the stairs. Why don't you tell me you have this? Hey, Mint. Kook kook kook. Lin, put it back where it belongs. If you want to drink it, call my dad in China first. I don't like people who don't have manner. You want some? Let's get wasted tonight. Are you drunk? I'm not. I wait you for a long time. Why don't you sit, Lin? Guess who I am. He's lost it. You are pretty like... Pong from SMF. Rude! Don't you think I look like Poi? You look like Poipet. Poipet my ass. I'm pretty, right? You shouldn't ask. Am I? No? Then I have to transform myself. I'll transform into Sai. Haven't you guys ever heard? What? Just one touch to be like Poi. I took some still shots, not video recording. What are you doing? This is patient's wig. You can't play with it. I feel sick already. It's Lin's fault. Lin took it. I didn't know. Is she gonna kill me? Hey. The neighbor complains about noises. If you don't want to help, please don't be a burden. And this wig, even though your friend brought it... It's your job to give back to me. Not playing with it like this. Lin, you. Look who's talking? Then give me back my shirt. It's just a shirt! And this is just a wig, what's so important? You took all my stuff. Bag, doll. And this stupid shirt too. Calm down. At least she doesn't took your boyfriend. Right. She doesn't even have a boyfriend. "If you guys doesn't have anything to say, shut your mouth." Cheers? Right, cheers. Lin. Put this stupid wig back where you took it. Thank you, ma'am. Bitch, you're still making joke, aren't you? Mama girl. Hell yes. Mom and dad love you. You took all of their love from me. Really? You think I like it, huh? I have to work day and night. So that you can spend all the money. Anything you want, they always give it to you. You know... I'm frigging hate it... That I had to wear your shoes. To play with stinky doll you used to play. And to wear this stupid shirt too. You want it back, right? Really want it, right? Take it. Dammit. What a nonsense. Hey! What's wrong with you, Lin? Lin Lin. Come on. Joom. Wait for me, Joom. Watch out. What the hell are you doing, Lin? Lin. What are you playing in the middle of the night? If you want to go this far... And the joke fails... I'll beat the shit out of you, Lin. I don't think it's funny anymore. Lin. Lin. Lin. Why do you play hide and seek at this hour? It's not funny. Lin. Mint. What? God! Whose blood is it? Key, key. Shit. Come on. Hurry. Give me a minute. Hurry! I'm hurry! I can't find a key. Let me, let me open it. Which key is it? Come on, Pond. Pond, hurry. I'm sorry. Break it with something. Go find something to smash it. Smash it. Here.

We carry it a long way. Here. Don't forget your luggage. Why did you buy so much stuff? We went to shopping. Why are you complaining? Mom. What's wrong? Why do you cry? What happened, May? Why are you crying? What's wrong? Where is Mint? Mom. May, where is Mint? Dad. I'm right here. Where is Mint? The Corpse Bride Why don't you give an injection for another one? Their family didn't say in a form. Beside... Mr. Mike's body isn't in a good condition. What are you doing? I said, do not open the coffin. That is Mike and Cherry's bedroom. Whatever you do, don't go in that room. This is supposed to be their bridal house. But the accident occurred before a wedding... ...only one week. What kind of accident? Prepare food for oblation here. The detail is in that book. Don't forget to light incenses. This is your room. Are you sure you're not afraid? I'm fine. "My full time job is always contact with patients and corpses." Working with you, I make more money than at the hospital for half year. That is Mike and Cherry's bedroom. Whatever you do, don't go in that room. MENU Sorry, I forgot. You didn't eat bean. Let go. Don't. Come here. Don't. Don't. Don't. They said you love each other so much. Get out! You said you love me. Then why do you do this to me? Because I love you. I love you, so I have to do this. Why did he hurt you so bad? I'm not afraid of you. I used to see ghost. As long as I'm here. You cannot hurt her anymore. I hope you'll like this room, Mr. Mike. I don't understand. Why did he do those things to you? But you don't have to worry. From now on, I'll take care of you. Why don't you let Cherry go? Don't you love me anymore? Because I love you. I have to do this. I beg you. Please let me go. You need help. Let me help you. You must stop hurting yourself. Cherry Cherry Cherry, no! Cherry Cherry Cherry Cherry, stop! Let me go. Let me go. Don't you love me anymore? Let me out! Let me out! Help me! Let me out! Let me out! "Your pic is so cute. Wanna see a sexy one for a change. Will you show it, please?" Bump, don't forget to submit your work tomorrow. What work? You open a door for girl. I'm a gentleman, don't you know? Hey, pretty As. Are you doing overtime? You're so diligent. I think you are gonna pass a trial period early. Come on, Bump. Let's go. What the hell? Come on. I gotta go, As. Let me tell you. She's only interested in handsome man. "Ugly as hell like you have no chance. Look who's talking?" I'm warning you with good intention. Hey, Nging. Look at that guard. Sleep all the time. I think we should tease him. What now? Knock it off, let's go. Why did you do that? Nging, this way. I'm outta here! Whoa, my stomach hurts. I can't take it. She screamed like a man. When you choose her, did you know? I know. She's your type, isn't it? But I think you like her. You had experience. O.T. (Overtime) What time? What? ""Do it" You think they'll come back to work tomorrow? I don't think so. Who's dead? Those morons are the worst. Chat facebook all day. Only work for overtime at night. Here goes our company. Shit! Shit. Hey, man. The cigarettes can kill you. When are you going to quit? Your dad died because of smoking, wasn't it? Don't you remember? You don't have to worry about me. I can quit anytime, trust me. In fact, I quit many times already. Oh you. What are you doing? If you don't come out, I swear I'll throw it. You see, Ran. You pull a prank on us so many times. We're just getting payback. Why do you have to be so mad? Yes. But actually this is Bump's idea. I'm all against it. Why you? You're thinking the same thing. If you want to pull a prank... You need to be more sneaky. I can totally see you pulling a chair with string. Why did you guys come back? Just remember I have to prepare for meeting tomorrow. So I come back to work overtime. Sleep all day, work all night. And you get more money. Jesus Christ. Where did you find these two? I'll go to work now. Put back a chair. A chair? Leave it here. Leave it? Thanks a lot. There is nobody here. No sir. I'm awake all the time. What? Yes sir. I'll go downstairs immediately. Wait for me. Hi. Tee, we'll go back now, our work has done. Are you done? Why is it so quick? What's the hurry? You guys can do double overtime. Oh, I wouldn't dare. At this rate, my boss is already pissed. If I do double overtime, he's going to fire me. By the way... Where is Karan? I haven't seen him. I think he's planning another prank. Teasing us since college days, isn't it enough? But we can't blame him. It's our choice to work in his company. I'll go now. Bye. See you. Back home safely. And come to work early morning. Oh, ok. Bossy. Don't be late. What's wrong with your leg? Don't know, it hurts when I walk. I think you're too fat, so your leg cannot take it. Shit! Are you taking that serious to be in a fridge? Mr. Karan. Oh, you're so hungry? I'm too. So I went to buy burgers. Why does your foot is on a fridge? Here. I bought it for you. Take it. When I went downstairs... I met those two on the way. You shouldn't let them leave early. I was going to tease them some more. What's the matter with you? Cat got your tongue? Holy shit! Shit. You are the man. I told you. If you pull a prank, you have to be this awesome. Yes, I believe you. You even pulled off a back of the fridge. There is no one more dedicate than you. You are awesome. Tee. Tee. Tee. What's wrong? Tee doesn't breathe. Come again? Tee doesn't breathe. Tee. Tee. Tee. Should we call the cop? Why the hell would we do that? We're in this shit together. Do you want you dad to find out? He wouldn't, if you're not telling. Ran, what are we going to do? Don't have to do anything! You two go on home. And never tell anybody about this. You got that? I'll take care of this. Ran! Ran! Hey, Bump. What? Did Tee's eyes close a minute ago? Crap. You're shaking your head because... He did not open his eyes. Or you don't know. I don't know. Will you close his eyes? No, you go on. Let him rest in peace like that. You ungrateful pussy. He is your boss. So? I'm afraid. Get out of my way. Tee. Tee, you pulled a prank again? Is it too much? Bump. Because you pulled one to me first. Did you see her face? Ran! Ran! Why did he do that? Karan! Ran. Why are you guys looking at me? You are the ones who teased me first. Hey Ran. Why don't you just quit? We didn't start it. Don't blame each other. You're all having fun. Why do you look so shock? I told you. If you want to pull a prank... You have to pull a great one like me. Enough! Are you guys completely insane? Shit, I'm out of here. Are you going to quit? No. I'll go home. Tomorrow we have a meeting early. Wait. I won't keep you for lone, Nging. But because you go back... Can you help me down? If you can climb up, you can do it by yourself. Access granted Dammit. What's the matter? Shit, mosquito bites. Hey, this is almost 3 am. They said ghost will have strongest power at this hour. Enough please. I cannot take it anymore. Have pity on us. Oh right, I almost forget. Forget what? Are you pulling another prank? Forget what? "Out of order" Can you find me a tape? Alright, boss. I'll find it right away. Why do you bother to put a sign? Anyone can tell it's broken. Yes, because it's broken. If maid came to see it like this... She would've thought there is a thief. Right. I'll go find it a tape, my desk might have one. Ok. Shit. What now, Bump? Why are you screaming? Tee. Tee. Is he dead for real? Nging, are you blind? There is an iron in his damn head. He's dead. Karan, what now? I found a tape. Shit! If Tee is lying here, then who's speaking? Bump, you don't want to know that. But But Tee said he found a tape, right? So that means he is coming here. That's right. Shit, the power is off. Nging, did you buy a new phone? Why do you have two phones? I have only one. Another one must be Karan's. Yes, I just bought a new one yesterday. But I lend it to Tee. Nging, come on! Why isn't it working? Let me see. Maybe the power is off, so it doesn't work. You mean it uses electric, isn't it? Shit! So if there is a fire, we're going to stuck. Who the hell bought this? The owner of company, I guess. It's me, right? Dammit! Where is security guard? Hey, guard. The key is in my room. Bump, you go get it. Hey, why me? Or you are fired. Yes sir. Nging, you are coming with me. Hell no. Come with me. I'm afraid. No. You two go! You're coming. Let's go. Quick. Why stuff is keep falling. It isn't a rain. Can we change to something else? Stop talking. Why did you challenge him? As human, he already like to tease. Can you imagine him as a ghost? So you did change it. Nging, please help me. I'm your damn friend. I don't know you. Let me go. Nging, did he follow us? If you're curious, go check by yourself. Let's find a key. Where is it? Where is it? Hey, Bump. Found it. Let's go. Bump, I said I found it, come on. Karan is waiting for us. Karan did not wait for us. What are you talking about? Where else could he go? He's here. How is that possible? Were we talking to ghosts? Are you dead? Perhaps I'm dead... and you're talking to a ghost. Stop being stupid. Let's go, Bump. We're the only ones who survive. Nging, is he looking for us? Bump, why you bring that up? Where are you going? Let's work overtime. Nging. What now? Nging, this way. Come on. Hurry. Wait. This looks like my shoes. I think your doll is more handsome than you. Where are those two? I don't know. They were freaking out. But serve them right. They got what was coming. Do you think we did too much? Too much? We pull a prank on them so many times. "But this time... We got them so hard and if they're still lazy." Working only on overtime. I'll deduct their salary for real. Let's pack. It's almost morning. Help me get this up. Take the head. Got it. Easy. Shit, why is your doll so heavy? Oops, are you hurt? Doll. Wait, wait, wait. Let's go. Shit. Exactly 3 am. Hey. Why are you two still here? Now you know we're pulling another prank on you. "Remember me, from now on. Do not holding your work for overtime, got that?" Why is your secretary calling my cell? Hello. What's up, Tarn? "She called me like a hundred times. I put on a silent mode." What's wrong? Really? Tee, what's up? What's wrong? Hello, Tarn. What's the matter? Hi, Mr. Karan. Something bad happened. "Bump and Nging fell down from stairs. They are dead. Around midnight." Nging, come on. Bump! Normally, does employee here do overtime? Not so much. But if you get more money, anybody wants to do it. Around 11 pm -12 pm, where were you? My private space. I'm a security guard. Did you see anyone suspicious? If you're talking about human, then no. But I have one question. What is your question? Why do you smile when looking at me? It's your face, what have you done? Oh, you mean why do I look so young? Bird nest. Bird nest? I scrub it on my face. Have you seen commercial? To brighten your face. I see. Yes. Do you want some? "Mr. Karan, you are at the office, can you go down and check?" Mr. Karan. Mr. Karan. Mr. Karan, are you still there? Mr. Karan. Mr. Karan. Mr. Karan. Mr. Karan. Shit!
