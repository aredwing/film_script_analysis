Ladies and gentlemen, - - to your left you can now see the Sanatorium. -Wow. -What the hell? lt was built far away from people becauSe of TB. They can't tear that down! Christ! They're building a road all the way up here just to tear it down. -Come on. -It's heavy! -Was that the last one? -Yes. -It's big. -Yes, it sure is. 6270 fucking square meters. ln three days? lt's like a cathedral! You plan to sleep on that? Almost like home. -See this? -Yeah, cool. -Need any more help, Even? -No, l'm good. We're good to go. OK. We have three days to inspect 312 rooms. And 4 km of asbestos-insulated piping. The dentist's offices are yours, Frank. They're from the '60s, so take mercury samples. Live, it's impossible to do this in three days. How do you eat an elephant, Frank? How? One piece at a time. -We are getting triple pay, Frank. -In Norwegian kroner. Any more questions? -No. -Good. Windows, Even. You'll find chlorinated paraffins, heavy metals, PCBs. -There are 732 of them. -732? Yes. Synne, you wanted to say something? Yes. All medical journals are to be destroyed or filed by me. We only have time to locate the shit, - - tag it, and leave. Nothing else. She has a job to do. Respect that. Just report to me if you find any documents or files. OK? -OK? -Yes. l have divided the building into five zones. Ole and Frank start here. -Gotcha. Zone 5. -The rest of us start in Zone 2. Frank? -Your mask. -I'm coughing up blood anyway. -Nobody has been here for a while. -Not since 1978. lt was a hospital and an insane asylum. Why are there still files here? The place never officially closed. A janitor was left in charge. l'm glad you joined us, Frank. l wrote five days in the report, not three. Why don't you trust me? We needed this job, Frank. You know that. Shit. -Demolition isn't ourjob. -All we have to do is talk loudly. What the hell is that? That's a nice welcome fanfare. Turn off your mike when you cough, Frank. Hello? Are you Karl? We've tried to contact you. We're here to inspect the building before it's demolished. Demolished? This place is my responsibility now. You can go home, Karl. You tell your employer that I take care of this building. The machines will be here in a couple of weeks. Hey, Karl, is that your name? Do you have any old blueprints of the building? Drawings. Understand? ls there anything you want to bring with you? You have to be out of here by tomorrow, Karl. -Is that the janitor? -Not anymore. Come on. Back to work. Holy ...! What the hell? Did you hear that? What ...? What the hell? Did you hear that? Sorry about Frank. He can be a bit much at times. No problem. l assume you'll look out for me? l have a satellite phone if you want to call home. Looks like it was made by patients. A German dog tag. From the war? Hi. Want some chocolate? Whatever. Frank was here. Dammit! Live, I just cracked a water pipe. It's pouring in here! Goddamn piece-of-shit mask! Just find the stop valve. Ole, take samples of that water. Dammit! Frank, l think I found the stop valve. Oh, shit. We have another leak in Zone 2. Shit! DOCTOR'S OFFlCE -Live, where are you? -l'm not sure. l was following the pipe. Anyone else know where I am? In the Middle of life? Funny. Ole, aren't you a hunter? -I found a wildlife caMera up here. -You sure that's what it is? My God! Help! Live? I'M at the bottom of the stairwell in Zone 5. Help! Careful. What ...? -Who the hell is this? -I don't know. ls he alive? Hello? He's breathing. Hello? What? What are you saying? He's saying something! What? Speak louder! He's speaking German. Hold him! Calm down. Come on. Hey, Live ... Live. -Live. -Come on! The alarm was triggered a week ago. l checked around. Didn't see anything. People and animals often seek shelter in here. Sometimes they trigger ... There. That's him. How could you not see him? Huh? l haven't checked this in ages. He hung there for days, and you didn't hear anything? Calm down. -I'll call the police. -No need. lt's my responsibility. Here. l found the old blueprints. Thank you. We have to keep an eye on Karl. Aren't you going to call? Of course. Let me do it. lt's better coming from me. Live, let me handle this. l'm the safety representative, dammit. -What did Kilroy say? -Carry on. Don't touch anything until the police get here. So we just leave him down there? l find that totally disrespectful. How many thousands have died here? We're respectful no matter what. You two, go down and seal off the area. Cover him with a tarp. The lake behind the sanatorium supplies it with water. The stop valves are indicated on every floor. l knew our drawings were wrong! Look at this. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, five. There's another entire floor down there! -That will take another day. -It's probably just crawl space. Let's focus on these stop valves for now. Find them and shut them off. And keep all drains open for now. Just one little question. How many drains do you think there are? 100? 500? 1000? Ole? Ole, come here. Stop it. Leave him alone. Something's coming out of here. We're finished here. Come on. That was the last one. What are you looking for? l'm from National Archives. Do you have anything you think we should take care of? ls that you? Yes. You've been here a long time. We only sing. Reading and writing makes us dizzy. That could have been me. Are you a survivor of the vaccine experiments? They went in here. Mein Vater war Deutscher. Live? The initial lab report is ready. Windows from 1965-75. 1 1 % chlorinated paraffins. Mercury around the drains. And one dead man. And the water samples? Anoxic. -Dead water? -Yup. But it comes straight down from that lake. -Is it polluted? -There's no life. No oxygen. Lots of sulfur. Lord knows how many patients have drowned up there. Take some more samples. Cute girl. lsn't she, though? l've never been so proud. Son of a bitch ... Hey! Who's out there? Come on! Let me out! Even, is that you? CoMe on! Hey! Goddammit! Let him out. l don't think you need to lock the stalls here. Shit. Look at this. Look what l found. lt was in there. lt probably belongs to that guy we found. What the hell? What is this? Frank, do you read me? -Frank here. -Status? We're on our way down. OK. Keep all the drains open so we can get rid of the water. l'll find the pump room in the basement tomorrow. l'll stop the leakage. No problem. l can go with you. No, we don't have time for that, Ole. Synne, can you check the basement with Frank? Sure, l can do that. -Just stay the hell out of my way. -What did you say? l don't have time for that paper crap. l work better alone. No one goes down there alone. What happened to "always close the stop valve first"? -"Always close the ..." -We'll fix it tomorrow. -Are you going to burn everything? -No, not this. 44 war children and mothers were interned here after the war. They were part of an experiment to find a TB vaccine. Not many survived. This picture is nasty. Did a plane crash in that lake? Yes, a German one. During the war. The pilot was drowned by Norwegian resistance fighters. They also stabbed his eyes out. -Nazi bastard got what he deserved. -Says the Swede. Shit. The flashlight! Don't worry, son. Soon it will all be over. What the hell? He was right. They seek shelter here. That old man keeps an eye on everything. What is that? Frank? What was it? "ln the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king." You didn't call, did you? Of course I didn't call. We'll never finish in three days with cops crawling all over the place. And you know what happens if we fail. But screw the company. Go ahead and call. Have you heard from the police? Yes, they're on their way. Why does he take so many pictures up by that lake? Karl says his father was the pilot that crashed. But that can't be. You took it! Who is that? We need a word with Karl tomorrow. -What's this? -Something l found. Medical records from 1983? But the sanatorium was shut down in 1978. Someone was keeping records four years after the place closed. -Who signed them? -It's impossible to decipher. Looks like you need to talk to Karl too. Good night. lt's a good gun. Here. Try. Look! Come on! Come on, do it. l didn't mean for you to hit it. lt looks like someone lives here. l don't have time for this Picasso bullshit. What the hell? Another wildlife camera. And this is bait. Yech. Ole and Even, where are you? Are you done with Zone 2? -Yes, we're almost done. -Meet me at the base in 5 Minutes. Bring that. l have to pee. Hello? lt's his tent. Yeah. Someone must have moved it. l'll go find the pump room. OK. GERMAN WINGS UNDER WATER CHlLDREN'S WARD Was machst du hier? Ich folgte dem Wasser zum Gebaude. Jemand tut etwas Beschissenes da. Ich ... Frank? Frank! Look at this. Keep going. Holy shit. -Have you heard from Synne or Frank? -Live, look at this. What is that? -Where are you going? -To Karl. Just keep on working. Frank! Synne? Synne, do you read me? Frank? Want us to come and get you? Frank! Karl? Who is that? That is my son. Yes. ls he sick? He is getting the best care possible. Are you a doctor? l saw what the doctors did. With my father's eyes. Mit den Augen meines Vaters. What are you up to, Karl? How many of you are there? l believe this is yours. What are you looking for in the dark, Karl? Huh? For people struggling for their lives? Tapetum luciduM. Sensitivity to light. You'll survive longer if you can see in the dark. Synne? Attention, everyone! Karl is not alone. He has a son. -There! -You haven't finished out there. lt's good enough. They're tearing this place down, not fixing it up. Synne? Hi. Come here. Goodbye, my son. We are going to sleep now. Die Luft ist khl und es dunkelt Und ruhig fliesst der Rhein Der Gipfel des Berges - - funkelt ... Live? Ole calling. Status? I closed one of the stop valves, but the water is still flowing. Synne, can you hear me? Synne? -Are you all right, Even? -I hurt my foot. Sit still. l saw something. What? A little girl. The girl from the wildlife camera? -She just sat there. -Have you heard from Synne or Frank? No. -Why, has something happened? -No. l just can't seem to reach them. Hey. Where are you going? To the basement. Stay here, in case they show up. Someone sliced open the man in the stairwell. That's a police case, Even. Drop it. lf Frank had made that call, help would have arrived by now. Make the call if I'm not back within 20 minutes. But not before, OK? lt's your responsibility now. l put my faith in you, Even. Synne and Frank, I'M on my way down to you now. -Frank, do you read Me? -Even? Look out for Karl. He and his son are missing. Do you read me, Even? Even? Frank? Frank, do you read me? Frank? Fuck! Live? -I think Frank is up here. -Good. ... celebrate this day as it has been - - for all Norwegians since our founding fathers at Eidsvoll ... Even? Ole? You're bleeding. Let me help you. Don't touch me! Don't worry. Ole? Even? l'm heading down ... Live? Live, do you read me? l'm in the stairwell. Karl is here. Karl! Even and Ole, get everyone out! Get everyone out of the building! Wait! Karl? ... iMMediately. Even and Ole, get everyone out now! Even? I'M heading for the baseMent ... Even? Even, what happened? I can't hear anything. I hear nothing. Even? Hey! lt's Even. What's the matter? -Even ... -What's going on? -What is it, Live? -That's Even! Shit ... Who is that? -We have to call for help. -I gave the phone to Even. No, wait. Wait! Ole! Hey! Turn around! Come here. Come on. Hurry. Come on. Hurry! -Someone is down there, Live. -I know. We're getting out of here. Live? Ole, it's us! -What happened? -Did you find the phone? -Have you called? -It's broken. It was smashed. What happened? Where is Frank? Look at me. Calm down. Can you tell me where Frank is? -We found the tent. -In the basement? Someone pulled me out and into the water. -Who pulled you in? -I don't know. Frank was gone. -Who pulled you in? -I was under. Couldn't breathe. -Where were you, Synne? -In the basement. "H". Synne is "H". Look at this. Look back here. Even had an "L" on his forehead. "Hilfe". "Hilfe" means "Help". Hilfe is everywhere. H-I-L-F-E. We have to get out of here right now. Frank is dead, or he would have been here. -Frank is "l". -Where did you see him last? -Frank is dead! -We don't know that! Come on! We have to get out of here now! Everything will be OK, Synne. Calm down. Stay here, Synne. l'll be right back. Live! Ole! l have a little girl back home. Sorry. Get out of here. Live! Frank? Synne? Karl? WELCOME TO OUR HOME Frank? Ole? You have to wake up. Where is he, Ole? Where is he? Ole, no! No! Synne! Live! Synne!
