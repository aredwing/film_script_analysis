So the acceleration of gravity "g" is determined, uh, by "m" and "r" at the earths surface. Now we know that objects, uh, vary from place to place so in order to evaluate it we will simply use "M-G". Now if we want to, uh, evaluate an object some distance from the earth... Yes! Katlin. Perhaps you can answer the equation if, for example, G equals six point four times ten to the sixth? Um, V equals... six point zero times ten to the twenty-fourth power. Pretty good, Katlin. See you tonight. - Bye, guys! - See you later. Bye, bye... Ten bucks? I mean, the way you screeched I thought it was like a thousand. Yeah, well, I cant help it, I think of it in Euros. Just think, this represents a half a night in a youth hostel full of Dutch guys. So what do we have today? Hey... wow! Hi. How many books can you honors girls carry? You look like sherpas. Yeah, well, were smart and strong, Janice. So, you coming tonight? Oh, shit, um, can Maureen come? I s Cheryls birthday party. Oh, cool. Sure, you can come. Awesome. What kinda party? Oh, its just a few of us. My place at eight. - Alright. Thanks, Katlin. - Cool...

Vegas had the Packers by twelve. Can we clear this off, Alastair? What for? Dad, I told you. Cheryls birthday party. Well, cant they do it downstairs? I told Katlin it was up to her. Ohmigod! Its the backpack. Thank you! Thank you! My mom helped. A lot. That must be them. Prepare to be Janiced. Youve met Maureen, right? - Ya, nice to see you again. - Hi... you too. Hey. Look who I found. And I have a little contribution for the party. Look under your chair, Cheryl. Cellar raid. Ditch it if your Dad comes down here. Thanks, Mom. - Yeah, thanks. - Thanks. Well, I thought if I brought down some wine, you guys might lay off the crystal meth. Have fun. You guys want some cake? Barf. So Cheryl. Whadaya wanna do for your birthday? Oh, I dunno. Play cards?

What a liar. Its called bluffing. Bitch! So, its your turn to deal, Maureen. Id rather stick pins in my eyes, but thank you. You really get a rush out of this, dont you? So, what are you gonna do with the money? Shes gonna buy a baguette. In Paris. My business manager. Apparently. One night of cards. Eighty five bucks closer to Amsterdam. Beats McJobbing, huh? But I dont know, I mean... dont ya feel kinda weird about taking their money? We won it, we didnt take it. Look! Look, look... Wha s up with them? Matt Birman just shot you with his finger. Hey, but... Shhh... shut up, shut up... So, brains. Heard you fleeced Maureen at poker last night. "Fleeced" actually means "cheated". I just kicked her ass. Maybe you want in on the football pool then. See, the tiny little boxes are the games, and the itty bitty numbers... Tim? If you figured it out, Ill be fine. Are these your odds or the straight Vegas line? A mix. Is that okay with you? Just fine. Give me Steelers over Washington at six... what else? And Denver over Cincinatti four and a half. Ill take the dog. Put me down for sixty. Any more? Got lots of action open. Not today. Thanks, Katlin. Bye, Cheryl. Ohmigod, that was a wesome. Katlin, since when do you know anything about football? Are you kidding? Osmosis. Between my Dad and Terry, I could referee a Rose Bowl. You are a total maniac. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Run, you big doofus! Run... Ya! I told you the Steelers were on fire! Im going for a run. - Hi, Mom. - Football? Over Fashion File? Cheryl thinks the quarterback has a nice ass. I do not! I dont. Well, its hard not to notice when theyre bending over patting each other all the time. Back in a bit. - Go, go, go, go, go... - Come on! Come on! ...did we just...? We won. We won! Ohmigod. Tha s the two games we picked. Ohmigod. How much money is that? Sixty, eighty, one hundred... - Keep it coming. ...one-twenty, one-thirty. All the guys saw a girls name on the chart and everybody bet against you. You are money. My pleasure, Matt. Lets see what you got today. Maybe we should just quit while were ahead. Relax, I played it real safe. Look, you want to take your half? I wont be offended. No. It just... You know, Katlin, it... ...it makes me more nervous than you. If we had any guts at all wed pool everything. I mean everything, and start our own pool. Katlin! Great. Ohmigod. Is that her brother driving? So? Hot! You guys have met my brother Ron, right? I remember you. Remember, the last time I saw you you were around eleven, right? Yeah. Playing kick the can with Janice. Its, uh, been a while. So youre the card shark, right? Well, hardly. So, you wanna ride someplace? Uh, Im with a friend. Hi, friend. You both can come, you know. Its okay, were gonna walk. Some other time then. Sure. Maybe. - Bye, Janice. - See ya. You coulda gone, you know. No way. I was a real idiot wasnt I? No! - Yes I was! I was a geek, wasnt I? - No, no! Oh! Sweeeeeet! You were fine! Giants or Dolphins, Terry? Giants. Giants. Or Dolphins. Who cares? You care. She and Cheryl were practically cheering at the TV yesterday. Shes in a pool. A football pool? Why didnt you tell me? You made up some story... about asses no less. Because... its embarrassing. Whod you pick? Umm, Giants, Philly and Seattle. Well, youre bold, but youre not an idiot. How much? Five bucks. Five bucks is all right. Its entertainment. If there werent gamblers in this family, there wouldnt be any food on the table. You run a hedge fund, honey, youre not Bat Masterson. Listen, Cheryl and I are putting it all towards Europe. But its Matt Birmans pool. Hes the one really raking it in. I could make a ton more if I had my own pool... No, Katlin. This Matt Birdbrain, or whatever his name is, can loose that money just as easily as he wins it. And thats the risk. OK, but seriously, Mom, I mean... Katlin. I said no. So please dont turn to your mother. Now, this is exactly what I have been talking about. I was gonna say no too. I dont want her in any pool. Gambling is cheesy, Katlin. It doesnt suit you. I s not cheesy. But if youre gonna play, you set yourself a five buck limit, you dont chase your losses and do your research. Oh, gawd, dont say that. She loves research. Saints and Seattle, a two team parlay, for Mr. Hogan. Katlin! You learn fast. Yeah, well, I didnt know you guys had an exclusive. I dont. Lets have a look at your action. And do us a favor. Dont get caught. Yeah. Im going up to Mr. Chalmers office right now to see if he wants in. Smart ass. You took their money? Well. They take ours. Well, Katlin, I hope you know what youre doing. I mean, everything we saved is on the line. Paris, mon amie. Merde. You know, youll probably be taking bets on the Tour de France. Hi guys. Anyone for the Packers? Packers. Calling Packers. Twenty bucks. Great. Twenty. Theyre six and over. Great. Fifteen. Hey, arent you in my math class? St-Louis have four... Alright, Dallas over Broncos by seven and a half... San Frans a dog by twelve, and your Bears at nine over St-Louis. Alright, lets go. You got that? Great... What the hell is that? Great... Thanks. Alright, Bengals were a push, were even, great... No, you dont get a mark with the first bet you make with me okay? Go hit a bank machine. Where you going? Yeah, screw you. Okay. Hey! See ya later, girls! Oh, thats nice! Oh, no, this is mine. - What about that? - Yeah! - Sorry. - Thats nice. D ya ever notice how money kinda smells like urine? Thats it! I knew it smelled familiar. With todays pay offs... And purchases. Were still up like seventeen hundred dollars. Ohmigod! Okay, well, lets buy the tickets. We have a lot of action out right now. I need a pretty big float. Whats going on? I hate my duvet. Well, use that print coverlet I bought. Ill try it. Okay, is this too, uh, "see how young I am" for your Dads crowd? - No. - No. - Its fun. - Cute. Glo-stick, candy necklace? Bye, Mom. Bye. - That was close. - Yeah! You know what Id like to do with this? More than anything? What? Put it in a briefcase, give it to my Dad and say, "Here, do something with this, will you?" - Europe, baby! - I know! Doesnt it kinda smell like it? Yeah, it does. Totally. Two to one, plus on top of that... Dont spend it all in one place. Jeff! Even you win today? Sixty, eighty, a hundred... Just take it. - Go! - What happened? The spreads were all wrong. How? I dont know how. The moon was in the wrong alignment. Well, how much did we lose? Were fine, okay? Katlin, how much is left? Okay, now, see... Whats that for? Look, we cantt cover everyone, all right? So, instead of freaking out all the time, why dont you back me up for once? Hey. The big winners. Thats right. Sweet three team parlay. I s like six to one. I think i s like, what, nine hundred dollars? I think it was nine hundred fourty. Feeling the heat yet, Katlin? From you? You want heat, Tim, le s go double or nothing. She doesnt have it. Spurs over Dallas tonight. B-ball, now. And youre betting against Dallas. You want the payout, fine. Ill take your double or nothing. You better be serious. Im all serious. What are you, her lawyer? Katlin, what have you lost your brain? Its okay. I got a scoop off the web. The Mavericks star center is out. Tomorrow the debt will be nil. Or double! Jesus, Katlin. Why didnt you pay those guys first? Because I knew that theyd take the bet. And they dont know that Althone isnt playing. Who? Althone. The Mavericks star. Birmans not even on top of the injuries. Katlin, you know, I just dont think I can do this anymore. You cant wuss out on me now. Katlin, its all our money! In one morning! Im on top of it, Cheryl. Okay? Sports section. Sports section, please? Youre welcome. Whats bugging you? Nothing. School stuff. - Shit! - Hey! The losing part sucks, doesnt it? They made it seem like Althone was gonna get his leg amputated! Now hes "stretched it out" and ready to play? Oh, Katlin. Youre not still in that football thing? No, Ma, its basketball. Well, teams always exaggerate or hide their in juries. Its a psych. That games on. Yessss! Shit! Okay stop now. Hey! Payday! That basketballs a bitch, Katlin. You should probably a void it. Cmon, pay up. Well, coulda worked without a miraculous recovery, right? Guy makes eight figures in sponsorship alone. I think hes got a good doctor. So it goes. I owe you eighteen hundred. And eighty. But dont worry. Youll feel better once were spending it. Yeah... I can ha ve it in a couple days. Give me a break. Whatever. I mean, people owe me. Bank machines have daily limits. Its gonna take at least a day or two to get it together. I want an installment... today. Ill see what I can do. At lunch. Good. Proposition. If I get you that wicked snowboarding jacket you really want, what would you pay? What do you mean exactly? I mean no questions asked. All I got is fifty. Right, yeah... Alright, whaddya guys think? Its a nice color. So, whats this? None of your business. It didnt fit me, okay? Come! Look, I am covering the debt. By selling stuff to Janice? Whats the difference? Im gonna give back your money. How, Katlin? Its like thousands. Alright? Europe may as well be the moon now. Look, I dont have to pay you back. But I am offering, because apparently Im a little bit more resourceful than you. You know, Katlin, you are totally losing it. So... Katlin... Mom! Do you have to startle me? Sorry. Honey, its really late. I know. And its going to be later if I dont get this essay done. Programs a lot of pressure, hunh? Well, hang in. Gnight... Terry, we gotta go! Katlin, were you in my purse? Which one? Going through them all would take weeks. Very funny. Im pretty sure Im missing fifty dollars. "Pretty sure"? Am I throwing a fit? I did it to my mother once or twice, I just wanna know. Terry, shoes! Shoes! I told you three times! Youre a big boy now! Oh, hi. Hey. You know, I heard Birmans into you for like seven thousand dollars. Yeah, its bad, but its not that bad. Yeah, well where you off to? Because I gotta get my brothers car back anyway. Oh. Um, I cant miss anything today. One class. Cmon, hell even give us a ride back. Hey! I know. Hey. Yeah. Okay. Bye! Girl trouble? Depends what you guys wanna do. Yeah, well, weve got school. Tha s one option, yeah. Ive got ecstasy. - Claudes got ecstasy. - Really? Dont you think its a little early for that? Kids... Just presenting alternatives. How about cards? Oh gawd, here we go. Thats right. Youre the card shark. Ya, well, poker sucks. So why dont we do the E. - Hi... - Hi... So, got a little lunch money to make things interesting? I might. Alright, so I think you should take the white one, cuz Ive tried that before... So who do you usually play with? Got a regular game or...? Nah... you know, just for fun. Up at the cottage with my Dad... whatever. Uh huh. Well, Ill tell you what. You and me could sit around all afternoon trying to take each others money. Yeah... Or I could get on the phone, call a couple guys, try to make a real game out of it. So call em. How many, Ron? Two, Buddy. Lets take it up a notch, ladies. Bets a hundred. Im so high. Dont clench your teeth. Let her bet, Janice. Go eat some ice. Mmmm... I want some ice... Dont you know you shouldnt smoke that shit during your lunch break? Nice. Bets a hundred. Im a ware. Look out.

Okay, this is getting ridiculous. Ahhhh, gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen... Im late for dinner as it is, and I have homework to do. Excuse me? I dont get a chance to win back some of my money? She has homework! Where did you find this girl? She showed up with my sister. She has homework for gawd sake! Oh... Whoa! Katlin... Youre like seventeen. Sorry. I dont feel seventeen right now. No, you dont. But you are. Oh, shit, who cares? Man, what a day. I know. It was great. Im up, Im down. Its just a wesome. What? Ah, youre gonna think Im a total skid. No, tell me. Say it. Well.

Look, Katlin, youre allowed to have... youre supposed to have fun, just please dont lie to me, okay? Yeah. Ohmigod! Fashionably late, Katlin. Sorry. Youre slipping, kiddo. So, whatd you get? A "B". You know you look like crap. Thanks. Katlin, the pool guys are really pissed off. I mean, Tim Hammond is saying a lot of stuff. Like what? Hes gonna get his money back. You know, whyd you even sit here? Katlin? Youre wanted at the office. Tell me why Im here. Not quite sure what to lie about? Okay, convince me this isnt your credit card bill. You went through my room? You went through my purse? Twenty-six hundred dollars past due! The balance goes up and down like a yo-yo! Cheryl and I were booking things for Europe. Uh... Katlin! I can use the internet! "Rambler-Gambler-dot-Com"? Wha... What has gotten into you? Look, i s not all mine. We pooled some money together to bet on the internet. Who? Is it that Ron guy? Its not Ron.

Very intimidating. Youre not paying, Katlin. I hear shes got family problems. Were gonna start charging you interest. Hows prime plus two?

Funny... how youre sitting over there thinking about the money, instead of over here trying to make out with me. Well, you do have a few extra hundred. Seriously. I know this place we can go to. A casino. Not exactly, um, Vegas, but... private. You mean illegal? You need to play some real black jack. You cant work a system with that internet shit. The mysterious "system". Hey, its math, not magic. Ill show you some stuff. Seriously. Itll be fun. No. Just set your limit, Katlin. I cant, Ron. Why not? I have parents, remember? Im not exactly golden over there right now. So get creative. Mom, its the debating team thing. Not tonight, Katlin, no. Environmental legislation, baby steps or window dressing. I told you this like a week ago. I dont think you did.

Come on in, come on in. Place your bets, please. No more. Go. See that guy on the end? Hes got the anchor. Thats the chair you want. Good evening, gentlemen. Place your bets, please. That dealers working with a six deck shoe. Thats sixteen faces or tens per deck... Ninety-six total. Right. Cash in. So you want to count the ten point cards as they come out... Keeping track of how many are left in the shoe... Or your odds of pulling one, yeah. Without moving your lips, Katlin. Card counters get thrown out on their ass. Too many. Eighteen, sir. No card. Fifteen. Okay, okay. All Im really doing with this system is evening my odds against the dealer? Thats all you can do. Shave down risk and look for an edge. Blackjack is nothing but cold calculation. Okay, place your bets please. Hit or stick? You let the cards make that decision, not your gut. Only suckers go on faith. Got it. Good evening everyone. I hope Lady Luck is with you tonight. Lets hit it. Split. Splitting aces. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Dealer has... too many. Place your bets. Ron, I gotta talk to you, man. Ill be right back. I owe you, man, thats not in dispute. Too many. Hit. Too many. But these circumstances are beyond my control, man. Hit. Too many. Youre crimping the flow, Claude.
