Come on, kids! Daddy! Jeff?! Amy, what's wrong with Jeff?! He might've eaten something. I'll go to the front desk. Maybe there's a doctor here. - Okay. - Hold on.

There! There are more turtles over there! Joanna, let's go there! Little turtle rushing to meet the sea Broke out of your shell, you're now free Little turtle on a long journey Embrace the waves, follow your destiny Little turtle searching for that place Where time stands still and everyone stays Little turtle, have you found a home?

They need some help in the kitchen and waiters too. Really, Ma? Yes. That would help us in our household expenses... especially now that your Uncle Dado's boat isn't working. Ana, why aren't you wearing your shoes? I don't want to wear them out. We don't have money to buy a new ones. We also don't have money to pay for your hospital bills... if you acquire tetanus. Ma, I'm your daughter. We Bartolome kids are strong, right? No way am I getting tetanus! Fine, whatever you say! Here comes San Antonio's champion! Go idol! Go idol! - Go idol! - Go idol! - Go idol! - Backstroke Come, Buboy! And the winner is Ana Bartolome! Yahoo! - Sis. - What? Do you have something for me? What did the thin fish say to the fat fish? What? You're off the scales! - Sis, my turn! - Yes?! What do you call a fish that wears bra? Mermaid! I thought you didn't know that joke! Junior, I'm the expert when it comes to fish jokes! - Just serve the spring onions later. - Yes, ma'am. Has Lewinsky eaten yet? Yes, Sir. We already fed him. Very good! Mom is still in a meeting. I guess we have to go ahead. Ma! Auntie! Ana, why are you still up? Just finishing my school project. I'm going to sleep. I'll take care of this. - Ma... - Yes? We don't have any leftovers from dinner. It's okay. We ate already. Just get me a glass of water. Right away, Ma. Ana Bartolome Reminisces. Whenever I swim, I remember my Papa... and how he swam against the tides of life, for his beloved family. Ma... Don't be shy! It's fantastic! I got good grades in school for my writing. Your Papa was just good in one subject - recess. I miss your Papa. Ma... I'm really sorry. For what? If I went home sooner that day, Papa wouldn't have gone looking for me. We would have him until now. Ana, don't blame yourself for your Papa's death. It wasn't your fault, okay? Do you remember the song I taught you to sing whenever you're scared? Yes Mommy! Heaven, heaven, heaven when I'm with you. Darkness, darkness, turns into night In the gentle breeze, I feel your gentle kiss your love, my love... forever you'll bring Hi, mom. Did you just got home? Yes. Would you like me to make you dinner? I'm not hungry. Okay. - Mom, next week, it's my birth... - It'll be 12 years next week. Do you remember? Twelve years since we lost your baby sister. What were you saying about next week? Nothing, Mom. Just don't stay up too late. It's not good for you. Good night. Joanna, let's go see the turtles! Hurry! Wow! They're amazing! I would want to take them home. There are more turtles there! Come, let's go there! Hurry! Hurry! Joanna? Joanna? Joanna! Joanna... Joanna! Joanna! Jessica?! Jessica?.. Where are you? What's wrong? Where's your sister?! I looked away and then she was gone... What?! What happened?! Where is Joanna?! Where is Joanna? I told you to stay put and wait for Daddy! Why won't you just behave?! If anything happens to your sister... - Joanna! - Amy! Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Joanna! Dried fish! Dried fish! Dried fish! - Hey! - Dried fish! You got me there! Why are you still here? Haven't your classes started? Classes start tomorrow. Your slippers are already worn out. Use mine. These are fine. If your classes start tomorrow, shouldn't you be leaving already? But you have yet to hear my new fish joke. So, what's it?! What did the fish say to the other fish at the party? What? Hold this. 'Sup 'sup! It's not even funny! What's the joke? But seriously, why are you still here? Aren't you excited to see your crush... Aira! Aira! She's not my crush! Then it must be your other classmate, Margaux! The one you always talk about! I bet it's her! She's not my crush. I don't believe you! So, who's your crush then? You are... so nosy! I told you to use my slippers. See, you tripped. Take care of your feet. Don't you have a match this Saturday? And my crush isn't from Manila, and I'm not gonna tell you who she is. Hey! Come on! You smell good! Did you put on fish cologne? - Very funny! - Ouch! Lewinsky! We had a good game! Lewinsky! How are you? We're gonna go, man. Okay. - Good game! - Next time. How are you, Lewinsky? Hi Jessie. Hello! Wow. You're asking how my dog is. Because most of the time, dogs are easier to talk to. They don't lie and pretend like their owners do. And I'm lying and pretending? You are. That poem about the turtle. It's not about the sister you lost. It's about you. You are the little lost turtle. Why do you hate me so much, AJ? I don't hate you. I just don't want to be friends with you anymore. Because? You're complicated! You once said that all you wanted was to be loved. Yet when someone loved you, you turned him away. - Buboy, game! - Game! Is the timer ready? Hold on, Sis. Idol, the tide is strong. Please be careful, sister. Don't worry. I'm not going to drown. Promise, you'll come back? Of course! Timer's ready, Sis! Game! - Okay, game! - Sis, practice first! Okay! 1-2-3! For Mama! For Junior! For Buboy! For Grandma! Even if she's grumpy? Even so! And of course, for Papa! 1-2-fight! - Go Idol! - Go Idol! The winner... Arnel Diaz of Morato High School! What do fish win in competitions? What? Trofish! Are you ready to win a trofish? I feel like I'm a fish being sliced and filleted. I'm so nervous I could die. Why are you so nervous? My opponents are really good! See that pretty girl? She's won this event three years in a row! So what? You're still the winner in my heart. Ana! You have to step it up! You are our school's last hope of winning! You can beat that Santiago girl! Are you ready? Sir, I need to pee. What?! Pee in the pool! I feel like pooping and barfing too... I gotta go... Jess, I want you to do your best. You will win this again. - You can do it! Okay. - Yes, Coach. Amy, where are you? Jessie's event is about to begin! I'm already here. In the washroom. Hurry up! Okay. Thanks. You can do this, Ana. You can do this. Good luck. Thank you, ma'am. Heaven, heaven... Ana, the race is about to start. Come on! Coming! Hurry! Joanna?! My child! Ladies and gentlemen!

Too bad she didn't win. She won! Yes, second place. Second? No! Not Jessica, Joanna! The winner, that's Joanna! I finally found her! I found our daughter, Ariel! Hey Jessie, you did great. Thanks Dad. Congratulations. Mommy, I'm sorry I only placed second... It's okay. The important thing is your sister's here. Michael! Amy! Joanna... Joanna! Ana! You're the best! You're indeed the best! You're the pride of Zambales! - Look at this, Michael! - Wow! Amazing! Joanna, my child! I waited 12 years. I searched for you. I always believed you were alive! - Twelve years... - Amy. I'm sorry. I don't understand... Sir Stan? Excuse me, lady. Are you okay? Joanna, don't you remember me? I'm your mom! Amy. I'm sorry. Are you her father? I'm her teacher. Your wife sounds crazy. No, I'm not! She's my daughter! - Joanna, I'm your mom... - Amy, calm down. I'm sorry. It's just that 12 years ago, we lost our daughter. No... And my wife thinks that you're our daughter... Joanna. That's impossible. My name is Ana. Ana Bartolome. I know Ana and the Bartolomes. And I'm sure she's not the child you're looking for! No! I can prove to you that she is my daughter. - Ana, wait! - Joanna, our song! The song, baby! What... song? The one I taught you when you were young. Do you remember? Heaven, heaven, heaven when I'm with you. Darkness, darkness turns into night Do you remember now, my baby? You're not my mother. I'm sorry. Let's go. Joanna... Joanna. Let's go! Joanna... she's my daughter. That's Joanna! Why wouldn't you believe me?! I want to but this is not the first time! But this time I'm sure, Ariel! That girl is Joanna! And if she's not, then what?! Isn't it enough that we lost her once already?! How many times are we going to get heartbroken?! How long are you going to be in mourning?! When will you allow yourself to be happy? When will you ever allow this family to be happy?! I'm sorry, if I'm getting in the way of your happiness! And I'm sorry, if I can't easily forget Joanna just like all of you have! And I'm so sorry, Ariel, if I never stopped loving my daughter! I'll do everything to have Joanna back! So just because I chose to move on, I didn't love Joanna?! Just because I couldn't cry in front of you, I wasn't hurting?! Is that what you think?! - Ana is amazing, isn't she? - She is! Help yourself. Let's eat. - Grab a plate! - I will! Don't be shy. Help yourself. Eat as much as you want. I cooked all of that. Why so serious? What's up? I don't look like any of them. Duh. You don't have a twin. You're the only one... in my life... in all our lives, I mean. If I had a fish now, I'd turn it into... a flat iron. A flat iron? I'd use it on your face to straighten out that frown! There! Smile! If losing my identity... and my family is the price of winning, then how I wish I'd just lost the race. Ana. Is that really my name? Ana? Dad, to be honest, I don't want her to be my sister. She beat me. Dad, but if she really is Joanna, if we can complete our family again... I'd let her win every time. Dad, please. Let's find Joanna for Mommy. I'll go to bed now. Go ahead Ma! We'll take care of everything here. Ana, the bucket is full already. The councilor told me he'll ask the mayor... to give you a scholarship to go to college in Manila. If you study there, you could get a job in the canteen of Michael's aunt. Ana, You're so quiet. Is there a problem? Are you okay? Ana? I don't look like you. And I don't look like Papa either. Might as well. We're not really all that attractive. When I was in Manila, a stranger approached me. She knows the song that you taught me, the one you always hum to me when I cry. The woman said she taught me that song. And she says that... I'm the daughter she lost. Ma, you were the one who taught me that song, right? Even if I don't look like you, you gave birth to me, right? Ma, you are my mother, right? Ana... Ana! Sister! Excuse me, do you know where Ana Bartolome lives? Ana? That's her. Ana! Sister, is that your classmate? Thank you, Lerma. Joanna is really small for her age. Actually, she and Jessica are just months apart. We asked her for her name. We only heard "Ana". We didn't know it was "Joanna". Didn't you try looking for us? Ana could only give her name then, but not her surname. And we didn't know when and where Ana got in in our jeepney. We had stopovers in Manila... - and Pampanga as well. - We did. Thank you for taking care of Joanna, Lerma. Where's Berto? He's dead. My son died six years ago. Ana hadn't come home yet. So, my son went out to sea to find her. Little, did he know he'll die... Are you sure.. that Ana.. is Joanna? It's the same child in our pictures. And I'm sure a DNA test will prove that Ana is Joanna. - We can do that. - Amy. Lerma, you're a mother, too. If it's your child, you just know. For Mama, for Buboy! For Junior! For Grandma! And, of course, for Papa! They play with your medal like it's a toy. Aren't you worried they might lose it? It's okay. Contests and prizes are not important to me. What?! Then, you didn't deserve to win it. You shouldn't have joined the race... so that the medal could have gone to somebody who actually wanted it. I'm sorry. You really don't remember us? I'm sorry. I can't remember anything... You're lucky, you can't remember us. Unfortunately for us, we never forgot you. You were always in our minds, especially Mom's. And that which stays in the mind, is never gone from the heart. Brother Jeff, game! For Grandma! And of course, for Papa! If idol is really your sister, why don't you look like her? You don't look like her either. Huh? Don't we look alike? - Joanna. - Ana. Joanna... Joanna, I've longed to embrace you all these years. I miss you so much. Joanna, why don't you go pack your things. Let's go home. Are you okay, Joanna? It's Ana. Ana, is there a problem? I'm sorry. I hope you don't take this the wrong way... but I cannot come with you. Why? What's wrong Joanna? It's Ana. I'm so grateful that we meet each other again. I'm thankful that you haven't forgotten me. But my life is already here. My family's here. You would rather stay with them than come with us?! You think this is easy for us?! Why won't you come back home with us?! I can't decide if you're insensitive or just stupid! Jessica. That's too much! Ana.. We are your family. You belong with us, Joanna. It's Ana. I'm very sorry. I can't go with you. I'm sorry. You looked so different back then. But you were cute... when you still had four legs. What happened to your other two legs? And where's your tail?! Who cut it?! Who?! Tell me! Stop it! Why didn't you go with them, Ana? They came for Joanna Santiago, not Ana Bartolome. They were looking for Joanna, but they found Ana. Ana, Joanna they're both you. I know I'm Ana. But I don't know how to be Joanna. I don't know if I even want to be Joanna. Do you think.. I would have a better life.. if I didn't get lost? Nope. Why? If you didn't get lost, you wouldn't have gone here, you wouldn't have met me. Ouch! But it's true! If you didn't wander into your Papa Berto's jeep, then you wouldn't have a best friend who accepts you... as you are, fins, tails, legs and all. I'm one of a kind! You're lucky to have me for your best friend. We should have stayed. Let's go back tomorrow. Amy.. Please.. Can we not talk about this right now? Yes, Mom. Can we please not talk about people who are not here, because they don't want to be here? Joanna is not here because.. ..of me! Come on! Say it! It's my fault! If only I obeyed you, then Joanna would still be here. It's my fault, right?! It's my fault! I'm to blame! Say it! Jessica... Jessie... Jessie, that's enough. No! Come on, Mom. Say it! It's my fault! Everything is my fault! It's my fault she forgot us! Jessie. It's my fault Joanna chose to stay there! It's my fault she chose a different family! It's all my fault! Jessie, stop it. There! I admitted it! What about you, Mom?! When will you admit that it's all you're fault that this family is so messed up?! Amy! Madam, where are you going? Lerma, looks like you're starting a bit late. Hey, hey, hey! What was that? Oh, no! What happened, Jessie? Throw it away. There's no use for it now. Thank you, Amy! You're welcome! I'm gonna wear this. Mommy of Idol Ana, thank you for all of these! Are you and Mama going back to the market tomorrow? Don't get used to this. Are these enough for dinner later? It's more than enough. This could last us until dinner. I hope we never get used to this. I'll do it. Does Joanna love tamarind pork stew? Ana, I mean. - Yes! She loves it really sour. - The kind that makes you tingle? That kind of sour, yes! She really is my daughter then. When I make adobo, - she doesn't like it with... - Peppercorn! Correct! But laurel leaves are a must-have! Her favorite snack is... Bread rolls dipped in ketchup! She must have gotten that from you. Oh, no. From her dad. Eat! Yummy! Mommy of Idol, should I also call you "mommy"? No! Only Idol Ana can call her "mommy". It's okay. Mommy of Idol Ana is too long. Mommy of Idol Ana, the fried chicken is so yummy! Fried chicken everyday until the end of the world! Is this your favorite part of the chicken? Yes. And Mama's too. Ma, you want some? Alright. How about you, Amy? What's your favorite chicken part? The leg. Leave it to me. There. Aren't they looking for you? Do you want me to go home now? Ah, it's not that. - I just thought that... - Ana... Do you feel uneasy when I come visit you? Um... No... A little bit... I understand, baby. You do? You don't know.. how much I want.. to take you home with me, Ana. But I know that if I take you away from here, from your friends... your brothers... your Mama Lerma... I came here to bring you home, Ana. But I realized, you are already home. I just want.. a little place for me in your heart... just a small... tiny space in your heart, baby. That's all I ask, Ana. Delgado! - Sir. - Coach Rey is looking for... Jessica Santiago. She's not answering my calls and text messages. Her friends told me that you might know where she is. Jessica. So, this is how you wanna spend your birthday? How pathetic. What do you care?! Give it to me! - No. Come and get it. - Give it back! That's mine! Give it back! Give... You're such a hassle, you know. Everyone's asking me where you are. I'm sorry then. There was a time when you didn't think I was a hassle in your life. Yes. There was a time when I was foolish enough to think that... when I tell you I love you, you'd say it back. But you just laughed to my face. AJ... And I'm not gonna give you another chance to do that to me again. So, what should I tell them? I'm dead. Shut up and be serious, Jess. What's the problem? We found Joanna. I heard. Isn't that a good thing? Yeah. It should be. Or so I thought... I've been praying for this for years... for our family to be whole again. So that everything will be okay again. But why isn't everything okay? What do you mean? You know.. I didn't feel happy when I saw her again. I'm horrible, right? I tried to feel good about it. I even persuaded Dad to look for Joanna. I thought my feelings would change. I wanted my feelings to change. And? They never changed. I'm so pissed off. I was so mad when I saw how happy Mommy was. She never smiled at me... or looked at me the way she does with Joanna. I was so angry at her.. when she chose not to come with us. Because it broke my Mom's heart. Jess... You know what I don't want to feel again? Guilt. Guilt? I feel guilty because... I feel guilty because I'm happy. I'm happy that Joanna.. is never coming back. Goodness, Jessie! Where have you been? Quick, quick! Sir! Ma'am! Jessie's here! - Happy birthday! - Sir! Ma'am! Lewinsky! - I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry. Happy birthday, Jessie. Your Mommy has a surprise for you. Really? Happy birthday, Jess! Here is our surprise for you! Happy birthday! Ana, come here. Hello, Sis. Happy birthday. Hassle. Bad trip. What are you doing? Sis, let's put all these back so that you can rest. Where will you sleep? Are you going to do that every night? I'm sorry, Sis. I thought you were already asleep. Sis? What? You once asked me if I can't remember you anymore. I can remember that song that Mom taught me. Duh! That's how we found you, remember. Yes, Sis. What I mean is, I can still remember that. And I can still remember that when we were kids, I was so afraid of the monsters in our bedroom. Sis, I don't want here. There are monsters. I'm scared! But then you lay down beside me.. so I won't be scared anymore. Don't be afraid. Sis Jessie is here. Leave the monsters up to me. You can borrow Hoggy. Then, you lent me your toy. Let's sleep now. When we wake up tomorrow, it will be my birthday. Happy birthday, Sis! That's so sweet! And then, you embraced me. Do you still remember that, Sis? No. Really? I'm sorry. I'm getting confused. I might have just invented that because... I really want to remember you. Happy birthday, Sis! Wow! There. This is how we make a living in the province. Dried fish. How do you do it? We dry the fish under the sun, then Mama and Grandma add salt and spices. I see. Jessie's finally here. We can eat! Come Jessica, let's eat! What do you want, Sis? Dried or smoked fish? No, thanks. I'm on a diet. Please get me some milk. Yes, Jessie. How do you want your coffee, Mommy? I don't take coffee, baby. I drink juice. Yaya Minda prepares this really nice juice for me. How do you prepare Mommy's juice, Yaya? I don't make the juice. Jessie does. Sis, what's in Mommy's breakfast juice? Jess, I didn't know that you're the one who makes my juice. There's still more that you don't know. Like, the fact that our juicer's busted. I'm sorry. Maybe next time, I'll teach it to you. I have to go. We are also happy to finally meet you, Joanna. It's Ana, Mrs. Borja. Oh Ana, I'm sorry. We're so used to Joanna. We have heard and read about you... in Jessica's stories, poems and essays. You may take your seat. Class, by the way, Ana has been accelerated one year ahead. She's an honor student and she will be a perfect addition to this class. Hi. I'm AJ. Hello! I've seen you in a lot of Sis' pictures. Well, we used to be friends. Used to be. Jess, let's eat. Sis, you're so popular here! You're on every bulletin board. Sis, you think I can join the swim team? It'll be fun to train together. Oops, I'm sorry Sis. Why are you following me? It's lunch. Aren't we eating yet? Breakfast, dinner until we go to bed, we're together. Can't you leave me alone for lunch? You're a big girl now. You survived 12 years of poverty. You're so used to living without me. And I'm sure you'll survive this place on your own. Okay? Sorry. Two more and we're leaving! What fish is a karate expert? What? Tilap-yaaaah! Woah! Hey, you now wear shoes! Of course! You've moved up in the world. You're now So-fish-ticated! My sister, she's so-fish-ticated. And her classmates too. I wish you were in my school so that I'm not the only one who's... Not sophisticated? No. So that I'm not the only one into corny fish jokes. In other words, you miss me. Of course... not. Alright. Just so you won't miss me, I'll drop by your house sometime. Okay? Really? Promise. Wait. What really happened between you and Sis? Why aren't you friends anymore? Long story. Come on, tell me. It might help me understand her better. Come on, AJ. Spill! Hurry! Shoot! You know, I don't believe you. I think you still love my sister. What makes you think I still have feelings for her? I might like someone else now. Liar! Why don't you try courting her again? Why don't you try shooting that ball first? Okay, if I make the basket, you'll have to say 'I love you' to Sis again. - Game? - Okay, game! Unfair! You cheated! That ball should have gone in! No fair! You are the cheater! Give it to me! Jess, how would you feel if AJ courts Ana? Nothing. Should I feel something about it? So, you won't get mad if they become a couple? Hey, give it to me! Cheat! Jessie, come on! Let's play! You already have someone to play with. You don't need me. Aren't you joining us, Sis? Go away. I'm busy. Stop it! I'm studying! Grumpy Jessie! Payback! Hello Mama! How are you? How are the boys? How's grandma? Ana, I can't hear the TV! - I'm sorry, Sis. - Get out! Lewinsky, say.. 'I don't like Ana'. Lewinsky, bad dog! Bad girl. I'm glad you have Joanna back home with you. Is she having hard time adjusting? She's doing very well. Sis, the coffee here are expensive! And difficult to pronounce. Ca-pu-si-no? Ma-ch-ya-to. Macchiato. Capuccino. Is that how you say it? Stupid. - Where? - Let's sit here! Compress! 1-2-3! Smile! - I finally got it, Daddy! Look! - Wow! Yahoo! Ice cream is such a big help, isn't it? - Let's eat! - Here, have some. Yum! This is the right answer. Mrs. Borja is here! She's here with the rankings! I'm so excited! Oh, our retreat is pushing through. That's 2 Fridays from today. You have enough time to get your parents to sign the consent forms. Those without consent forms can't join. - Okay? - Yes, Ma'am! Mrs. Borja, where are the rankings? I'm about to post it. Here it is! Yes! You're still number one, Luisa! What happened to Jessie? From top 2 to top 8? What happened? Congrats, Ana. You're top 6! - Really? - Look. Sis. I already called your Mama Lerma. I told her to come here so we can celebrate! Really? We should have fried chicken for Buboy! Ana, I'm so proud of you. Oh, Jess. I'm sure you'll do better next time. Too bad you're not top 2 anymore. You feel bad? Why? It didn't seem like a big deal when I was top 2. It wasn't enough of an achievement to celebrate with a party. What? It's true. We never celebrated the fact that I got the second highest grades in my class. But we celebrate being top 6. Don't worry. Next time, I'll try my best to be top 6. Not top 2, not top 8. Six. Jess. Give me two more laps, Mark. Jessie, don't be late tomorrow. By the way, have you talked to Ana if she'd like to train with us? I think she could really be a good addition to the team. She told me she's not interested. But why? Tell her she could be a better swimmer. With more formalized training, she could be just as good as you. If not, better than you. This is you. And this is me! Who's Hoggy? Nanny, silly! You're Nanny! Hoggy? Your sister was so afraid of losing Hoggy, she'd carry it even under the shower. And there was a time when she'd call Hoggy, Joanna. So that it would be like she'd have you beside her when she sleeps. You were my proxy! Now, you're clean. You can sleep beside Sis again. Ana! I told you not to touch my things! Sis, wait! I'm sorry. I just want... You want to take everything from me! No, Sis. - I don't want to take anything... - Liar! You're such a liar! Even when we were kids, you always took everything from me. You never changed! Jessie, Ana just wants to clean Hoggy... Stay out of this! Careful with your tone! I thought you'd be pleased... Do I look pleased? You just have to mess up everything! Jessica! You're ruining everything! You want to be part of everything! You want to be friends with my friends? You can't. Because they don't like you! You want to be part of the swim team? You can't. Because we don't need you! You want to be everywhere I am? You can't because I don't want you near me! Jessie! Calm down. You're turning mad because of a toy?! You're overreacting! Take it easy. Don't tell me to take it easy. Because you don't know how I feel! Are you okay? Hello, Ana? Ma... How are you? I'm okay. Are you okay? I just want to hear your voice, Ma. Here... Ma... Please embrace me. Of course! Can you feel it? Here's a super hug from Mama! There! I love you, Ana. You'll be okay. Yes, Ma. I'm okay. You'll be okay. You can do it. You're tough like me, right? Yes, Ma. Promise. I love you, Ma. I love you, Ana. Let's meet at the clubhouse. I really need to get out of this house and get away from Ana. Bye. Hi. You said hi. Are you going to pretend to be my friend today? Well, do you need me to pretend to be your friend today? I don't know. Maybe. Yes. I hate my life. Why do you hate your life? Hello, Allan. AJ! Have you and Ana started our project already? I'm already at their house. I'll see her in a bit. Okay. Okay, bye. I have to go. Ana and I have to finish our report for class. Are you courting her? You'd be a bad match. Actually I didn't see why you like her. Unless... you enjoy her stinky fish odor. You know why I like Ana? I like her, because she's not you. - There. - Here? Just strum the strings like this. That's good. Strum a little harder. The pizza is here! Come inside! - Bring in the pizza. Come, boy! - Thanks. Wait. Michael! Oh, sorry. I thought you're the pizza delivery boy. This is Michael, my best friend. Michael, this is our Nanny Minda. - You didn't tell me... - Hello. you and Ana are friends. Michael, this is AJ, my classmate and future husband of Sis Jessica. Very funny, Ana. But it's true! Right, Yaya? True. Hey, man.. I've heard so much about you.. from Ana's stories. Sorry. I don't know anything about you. Ana never mentions you. She didn't even tell me that you two are busy. I shouldn't have come. I'm disturbing you guys. No you're not! AJ and I just finished our report. He's now teaching me how to play the guitar. I know a lot now! Uhm... How is that again? I forgot! AJ, help! - I just showed you how. - How is that again? Okay. Here. There! There. Push a little harder. Good morning everyone. Take this retreat as a chance to strengthen friendships... and to repair broken relationships. Our activity for today is to give a letter and a token... to express our appreciation or.. to ask for forgiveness... from the person.. that we value the most. Okay? Who wants to go first? No volunteers? Ma'am. Okay, Ana. Sis.. Do you still remember what I told you.. about this medal? This is not important to me. Winning is not important for me. What's important to me is... love... ...family... And you, my dear Sis. You are important to me... because you're my sister. Because you are my one and only big sister. Because I love you so much. I'm sorry if I did anything wrong to you. I hope we can be okay now. Come on, Jess. Take it! Go on, Jess! Jessie, stop being so difficult! Jessie, forgive her. You have to make up. Please, Jessie. Take it! - I'm hungry. - Me, too. Let's eat. It's lunchtime. - Let's go, Jess! - I'll follow. Careful. You almost tripped. Sis! Sis, what's wrong? You again! You're like a pesky dog that just won't go away! Sis, that hurts... That hurts?! After what you did to me?! You made yourself innocent little princess! And I'm the evil villain once again! Sis, I'm sorry... You're sorry?! Sorry?! If you're really sorry, then stop ruining my life! Why can't you forgive me, Sis? Sis! What have I done to you? You lived! You lived and Mommy gave all her love to you! There's no love left for me! That's not true. Mommy loves you. No! Everyday, I've had to pay for losing you! Everyday, I've had to compete with your ghost! And everyday, I lose! I wish I were the one who got lost... It's so unfair! You have two mothers who love you so much. Why is everything so easy for you?! You think this is easy for me? Easy for me to leave the family I grew up with? Easy for me to give up Ana to become Joanna... and try to live in your world?! And what do I get? All your snide remarks and insults? It's not easy, Sis. Everyday, you've had to pay for losing me? What about me? How long will you make me pay for coming back? Tell me! What can I do so that you can forgive me? What should I do for you to accept me? See that? Beat me. You're not used to swimming at sea. - It's dangerous us... - I don't care! If you beat me, I'll leave you alone. But if I beat you, you'll disappear in my life for good! You're my home and together we shared this love for us to be happy and free You're my home and together... we'll stay to make this world a better place to be Ana! Ana! Sis! Joanna! Joanna! Joanna! Your sister will be fine. Can I see her? Okay. I'm sorry, Mommy. I'm sorry. Sorry for what? I shouldn't have said yes to her dare. It's okay, Ana. I'm just glad you were there to save your sister. Can I go back to Zambales? I want to stay there. I hope you understand. I love being with you. But I don't want to see my sister hurting again. Ana... We were apart for 12 years. But all that time, you moved farther from sister. I wasn't the one who got lost. It was Sis Jessica. She was right beside you.. but you never really saw her. Maybe that's why.. I should get lost again. So that you can find my sister now. Dad... Where is Ana? She'll be staying with her Mama Lerma now. I miss Ana. Me too. I wonder if she'll ever come back. Good evening, Sir! Good evening, Ma'am! I don't know the song. Because I never taught it to you, baby. Because I never gave you my time. Mommy, sorry for everything. I'm sorry I'm not Joanna. No, no, Jessie. No, no. No, sweetheart. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry, baby. Please forgive me. I'm sorry, baby. What's up? You look so serious again. You must be thinking of AJ again. He's your crush, isn't he? I'm sure, if he asks you out, you'd say 'yes' right away... because you like him... What? I told you, he loves Sis Jessica. How about you? Who do you love? You'd have to tell me your crush first! Come on! I have something to say first. Where can you find a fish that really loves you? Where? Right here. And that wasn't a joke. You're so cheesy! Ow! Cheesy, huh? How long will you be away? Just this weekend. Two days. I'm gonna miss you. You'll miss me? I'll miss you.. cause I love you. You always do this. I feel so stupid for saying 'I love you' again. Then, you'll laugh at me again. I'm sorry. It's just that you're so cute. I love you, too. So... So? Why are you being so cranky? I'm not gonna make it easy for you! Is that it? Really now? Here comes Sis Idol! Go Idol! Go Idol! Oh no! Idol stopped swimming! Miss Gorgeous, Idol might drown. Save her! What are you doing here? Saving you. Buboy will get mad at me if you drown, even if it's just pretend. Come back home to us. Come with us. Why? You need an emotional punching bag? Yeah, you can say that. What if I refuse? Alright. See that boat? Let's race. - The loser gets to... - Sis... You almost got drowned the last time we raced. You really want another round? Then don't play hard-to-get. Come home with us. Joanna, hold my hand. Come take my hand... Promise.. - I will never lose you again. - Come fill your hand With all the love you've seen Let every child be what they are Be what they want to be I already know a fish joke! What? What does a fish say when she wants to say sorry? What? Fish be with you. Here come the champions! Go Idol! You're my home and together... we'll share this love for us to be happy and free You're my home and together... we'll strive to make this world a better place to be for you and for me...
