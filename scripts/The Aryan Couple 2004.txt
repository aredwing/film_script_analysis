Gizi Flayshman was that which proposed the concept be paid to the Nazis the lives of Jews. The so-called "Plan Europe. But one day her Eichmann arrest then killed her. It was my very close friend. Must have been so brave. Under this "Plan Europe 'what is the minimum had to pay to save? Oh, very! In what world we live in! Far as I am interested in can you keep it. We heard you tonight and your family go. Is this true? Hope! But if Himmler did not think you can earn more money which is tonight already we would be in the gas chambers. How can you make this? What we know is that we to buy our lives, but not the life of someone less fortunate than us. Enough on this topic. Come, sit less. I have a gift for you two.
