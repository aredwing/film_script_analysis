We had no choice. Our parents forced us to spend the holy week... in a house we have in Sitges. This is the photo of the house. It's been abandoned for 10 years. It will be very boring As we can not do The story of Girl Curve... I've been investigating an interesting legend in Sitges El Garraf. This legend says that on October 2, 1940... a girl in red dress got lost in the woods El Garraf. And the legend says that if you get lost in Garraf woods at night... the girl appears and shows you the way out. Go home, man. - What is the name of the girl. - Her name is Melinda. When does the story get scary? This guy is an idiot. Now we can not use it. - No. - Wow... You think it's normal? No? It is not normal? This was the last time.

I was fixing the roof and got hurt. Look here, Charles. Right. Yes, now is good. Hello, Carlos. First, thanks for your time. Tell us a little about the legend of the girl. The story of the girl, right? And very old. Passed from father to son. My father told me. She was named Melinda. They say it's the spirit a girl. A girl who was lost or fell into a well. His body has never appeared. They also say that the devil is deceiving us, finally... if you get lost alone at night she appears and shows the path. But you never saw? No. This story has many versions. Some say they never guided back to it. They also say that it was search for the mother and she got lost. And when you hear the murmurs... it is behind you. People who saw it... say they never forget the sound. So she is evil? I thought it was good, because it shows us the path. Like I said, there are many versions of this story. I do not think that is a spirit. I do not believe in ghosts. Just know that my father made me swear that never enter the woods... Garraf and I fulfill my promise. So thank you, Carlos. I'm leaving now. - What? - Do not worry. Wait a minute here. - Where are you going? - Agree July. - Why? - To hear the noise. - What noise? - How they sound? By God! July? July? - July? - What is it? Wake up. July? - What is it? - Do you hear the noise? - What noise? - That noise. Wake up. Come here. Or I will think I'm crazy. - You're crazy. - Look out the window. - I hear nothing. - It has to be quiet. I hear nothing. - July... - What? And if it's the girl? Cristian, do you believe everything you hear. Leave me alone. 1 APRIL 2010 DAY 3 - Mother... - Yes? - Where is Daddy? - In the office. - In Madrid? - Yes I thought the office was on vacation.

What do we do? What? Look at the outlet. See that? That's it. I think it's a person with their back to us. Look again. It is not a person. It seems to be shrinking like a ball. I do not know. - I do not know. - Right. But... Let's see if there's something more. What are you doing now? I connected the camera cable the laptop. I shoot the entire evening to see what makes this noise. In the forest animals may make that noise. No matter. I know who does this. 2 APRIL 2010 DAY 4 - Robin! - Robin! Robin! Did you see him there?

More details from Silvia Mauri. Police were investigating at the moment the deaths of three children... who were murdered last night at this home... on the outskirts of Sitges in the region of Garraf. According to police sources, the victims may belong to one family... and being underage. It is unclear how they died nor the motive. But police say it will be considered all possible cases. Police are still investigating the murders of three children... in a house near Sitges... say sources linked to the investigation. The bodies were discovered Sunday afternoon. Police investigators continue collecting evidence in the house in Sitges... where the bodies appeared this afternoon three children aged 8 to 18 years... all Spanish, and a man who probably called the Emergency services. The victims' bodies were cut apart in their own home. New revelations about the case of the Quintanilla family. Researchers believe that the appearance of a video camera... that belonged to the young Cristian Quintanilla clarify the case. Police analyzes the more than 37 hours of recording. No. Damn! The symptoms are fluctuating... and vary between day and night. The patient clearly worsens at night and in the dark. Women who have had episodes of schizophrenia in adolescence... are nervous breakdowns, irrational behavior or violence... have a tendency to lie in this situation... What is this? These disorders we call of postpartum psychosis. The patient suffered from severe depression after the first and second births... - What is it? - Of her children Cristian and Julia. But it was only after birth of the daughter, Michelle... that psychosis became apparent. In the case of Deborah, the symptoms were not detected early enough... and it is likely that she was hallucinating when she killed the newborn. Deborah has always maintained that there is a woman named Elvira. She says she hears her at night and that she sometimes visits. And is also to blame for the death of her daughter. Deborah, now I will ask some questions. I know you aren't sleeping lately. Tell us about this woman. Who is Elvira? Deborah? Who is Elvira? THE MYSTERIOUS MURDER OF A FAMILY
