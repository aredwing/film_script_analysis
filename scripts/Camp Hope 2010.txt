May he be spared the tortures of purgatory and be whisked to the bosom of our Lord Jesus Christ. - Amen. - Amen. Praise God. Are you packed, young man? I have your albuterol. Yeah, I'm almost done. Is Grandpa in heaven now? I hope so, sweetie. But every day we have to offer up our deeds and our prayers so that he might leave purgatory and enter heaven. What's purgatory? Tell your sister what purgatory is. Purgatory is a state in which those suffer for a time who have died guilty of venial sins or who have not satisfied punishment for their sins. I have no idea what he just said. Thank you, sweetheart. I don't either. Purgatory is like jail. It's a place of suffering we go so that our soul may be purified so that we are ready to meet God. Do I have to go to purgatory? Everybody goes to purgatory. Shh, no. No, sweetie. You're a good girl. Just be God's girl. The world out there... they want to take that away from you... your right to go to heaven. That's why you need to get on your knees every day and thank... Tommy's going to hell. Rose, bite your tongue. That's not nice. He is. When he's babysitting me and you're at your meetings, he makes me go to bed early so he can talk to his girlfriend. And the community says it's a sin to have a girlfriend. - He does, I swear. - Shut up, Rose. Do not tell your sister to shut up. And no swearing, young lady. It's not a sin to have a girlfriend. It's just your brother's too young. When do I get to go to camp? When you're older. But now you get to go to bed. I have to pack. I hate you. Hello. Father Phineas McAllister to see Daniel Jacobs. Yes, Father. Father McAllister is here for his appointment with Daniel Jacobs. Hello, Daniel. How have you been this week? Have you been eating? Daniel? Son, you can't hide from me forever. It's over six months now. Daniel. Are you hearing me at all, son? I'm going away for the next two weeks. I'll be at camp with the children from the community. Daniel, may I see that? May I see your book? Please. Daniel, listen to me. Listen now. There is hope. I have offered it to you time and again. Now just take the hand that is in front of you. Huh? I'm damned, Father. And you... you, my priest, have failed me, just like you have always failed. No. Yes, you have failed. You have failed. You have failed. You will leave this earth having left no mark, just scars. You failed. You failed yourself and you betrayed your sister because you do not trust in God. Are you happy with your life, Father? Are you... are you proud of all that you've accomplished? I'm a servant of the Lord. Nothing happens on this earth without God's permission? - Nothing. - Huh. Well, then I hate God... as should you. Daniel, now... No, I was reading the Old Testament. I was reading the Book of Tobias... the Book of Tobias. The demon Asmodeus killed seven men before God intervened and sent Raphael the Archangel to bind Asmodeus... seven men. That's God's will. There's no... there no hope. There's only God's will. Daniel, please. Your time is up. And you will not see me again after today. That's God's will. That's... that's God's will. Goodbye, Father. Daniel? Did you know about this, folks? These Islamo-Fascist extremists are using children as decoys to get past the military checkpoints and detonate their car bombs. These are the kind of animals we are dealing with. And it is getting sicker every day. Don't ask me. Just look... Thank you. You're going to hell! God is a loser! All right, this is it. Come here. I want to pray over you. O Jesus, you are our hope. Please find your way into my son's heart. Transform him into a man, a warrior for Your kingdom. Keep the devil and all his demons far away from him and protect him from the sins of the flesh. We ask all this in Your name. And please, Dad, watch over him. Amen. Okay, I am going to give this one to the nurse. You look like you're going to prison. What's the matter? I'm fine. Hey, just try to have fun, okay? It is camp after all. Concentration camp. They do still have the camp dance, don't they? Perhaps you and Melissa might share a dance. Huh? I love you. Hello, brother Jack, John. Hey brother. How are you? God is good. - How are you, John? - Lost all my clients, but... Yes, I know. I'm so sorry. Here. Thanks, Dad. - Be good. - Be good, you guys. We love you, sweetie. Nice. I know I'm gonna get stuck bunking with Jimmy. Is that a problem, brother? Looks like we're bunking together, Tommy. Looks that way. Hallelujah, brother. Hallelujah. Hey Jack. All right, boys, welcome. Welcome to another year of servant training at Camp Hope. I am Christian Bonderman. I will be your pastoral counselor. Some of you have already worked with me as your young adult leader back home. Everyone here has completed 10th grade at the community high school. Everyone's made commitments to Young Adults. We all know the rules we are expected to live by, but just so we are all clear, okay? There's no sign or representation of youth culture that is allowed. There's no rock music. There's no rock paraphernalia. There's no magazines of any kind that relate to youth culture. Your cell phones, otherwise knows as hell phones, are strictly prohibited. I hear any of these "Funky Town" ringtones, I'm gonna wring your neck, okay? There's no exclusive girl-boy relationships. There's no one-on-one time with any female at any time. And you must wear pants at all times except during swimming, when modest bathing suits are allowed. Now the sisters, don't worry, will be held to the same standards. They must wear skirts at all times, all right? And finally, leaving the camp grounds is strictly prohibited. Any violation of these rules will result in expulsion from the camp. Are we clear? Yeah, no food, no fun, no girls. Got it. I'm here to support you in living up to your commitments so that your time here can best be spent to get each and every one of you closer to the Lord Jesus. Say amen. Jack. Okay, to begin with, I'm gonna need to inspect all your belongings, make sure we're all on the same page, okay? All right? Unity, brothers. All right? Please have your bags open and ready for inspection. James, we'll start with you. What've you got? Let me get this out of the way. What do we have? Let's see. Why do you need this? You don't even shave. Um... What's...? Wait a minute. Oh, what's this? The jelly bean factory? That's nice. This is not a good start. I get hungry sometimes. Jesus got hungry in the desert for 40 days and 40 nights. I'm disappointed. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry for you. Okay, Tommy, what about you? You're reading this on your own? Yeah. Wow, that's good. Very good, Tommy. You should all be reading Dante. Jack, what about you? What is this? Yes, that would be "Spawn" number nine. It's very good. Look at this. That's Angela... very nice. This... I can't let you keep this. This is an occasion of sin. - I'm confiscating this. - You can't do that. Yes, I can. You know what else I can do? I can do this. What are you doing? Are you gonna test me? Pick it up and pray for God's mercy. Pick it up! Christian, my stuff's over here if you want to take a look. # This is the day, this is the day # # That the Lord has made # # That the Lord has made # # This is the day that the Lord has made # # Let us rejoice # # And be glad in it # # This is the day, this is the day # # That the Lord has made. # Amen. Hallelujah. Praise Jesus Christ. Holy is Your name. Bless Jesus. Please be seated, brothers and sisters. This is the day. Well, we are at war, brothers and sisters... at war with the world, at war with the flesh and at war with the devil Satan and his dominion. By all indications, brothers and sisters, we are living in the end times. And make no mistake about it... the devil is real. And what's worse, he knows he has lost. So like a cornered, wounded animal, he will lash out and take as many of each and every one of you to him as he can before he is cast down into that fiery pit forever. The beast walks. Now what we know of Satan and his demons... they know the world and its rules far better than we do. So he will use your imagination against you. He will use your lusts against you. And he will use your pride to deceive and devour you. And that is why we are so fortunate, brothers and sisters, to be called here to this camp at this time... this moment. The Kingdom of Heaven is yours if you take it. If not, tortures beyond your comprehension will be your lot for eternity. Now Jesus gives us no other choice. So rise. Rise, brothers and sisters. Rise, children of God, and take that which He has offered you. # All hail the power of Jesus' name # # Let angels prostrate fall # # Bring forth the royal diadem # # And crown him # # Lord of all # # Bring forth the royal diadem # # And crown him # # Lord of all. # Amen. Praise Jesus. Come on, Jesus. Hallelujah. Lord Jesus. Lord Jesus, protect me. Protect me, Lord. Lord Jesus, protect me. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Okay, mass 7:00 A.M. sharp tomorrow. Brothers and sisters, go in peace. Amen. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Did Tommy get into the liquor cabinet again? You told me that was behind you. - Hey. - Hi. Are you okay? Yeah. Why? I don't know. You went down pretty hard there. I was kind of worried about you. Yeah, it was a little unusual. I'm fine. Well, at least you didn't get hurt. Brothers need to be folding chairs now, not socializing with the sisters, okay? Good night. Truck! Jimmy, it's just a joke. Oh shit, he's having a seizure. - Jimmy, this is a joke. - Jimmy, Jimmy. - Jimmy, Jimmy. - Let me get this in his mouth. Someone get Christian. Go! Well, from what the boys tell me, seems like it was a stimulus-sensitive myoclonic seizure. What? What is that? It's a seizure brought on by a sudden light and/or surprise. Apparently they were playing a little joke on him. We're checking with the parents to see if he has a history of seizures. And we're gonna take him to the hospital now just in case, okay? I'm sorry, Jimmy. I never thought... I'm sorry. It was a joke my brothers played on me all the time. Yeah, well, you of all people should know better, Tim. You have to think about caring for your brother next time, okay? Okay? Yeah. Yeah. Of course. # Be Thou my vision... # Timothy, the body of Christ. # O Lord of my heart # # Naught be all else to me... # - John, the body of Christ. - Amen. # Save that Thou art # # Thou my best thought... # Thomas, the body of Christ. # By day of by night... # Amen. # Waking or sleeping # # Thy presence my light. # # Won't let the devil, get out # # I'm gonna let it shine # # Won't let the devil, get out... # Father. Yes, Thomas, how can I help you? I was hoping we could talk. I've been having... We have time. I will come find you. Yes, sir. Thank you very much, sir. Brothers, I have our schedule for today. After morning prayer time we'll break up into groups. Your groups will be designated by your bunk placements. All right? And then after lunch we'll have rec time. The game of the day... Capture the Flag. All right, so group A... we have Timothy, Jack, Thomas and Jimmy. We'll start with share group with me down by the baseball fields. And since Jack here felt that sarcasm instead of gratitude was an appropriate response to the kitchen crew's work this morning, the four of you will be on clean-up duty this evening. - The sin of one affects many. - The sin of many. Does anybody have anything that they want to share? How are you guys doing with your commitments this summer? Which ones? Are we gonna have enough time to go through all of them? Ha. You know what? I have to repent. I broke one of my commitments. I found this CD... this Journey CD. I don't know why, but I must have listened to it 100 times. Do you still have it? No no, I threw it out. I mean, I can see that it was affecting my spirit. Good good. It's good that you can see how rock music can affect you. I mean, before I found the Lord and came to this community, I can say rock music led me down a very dangerous path. It started with going to concerts. And at the concerts there were drugs, okay, and drinking and people engaging in premarital sex. Doubt you were one of them. - What's that? - Nothing. - I have a question for you. - Yeah. You understand why I tore up your comic book? Honestly, no. But I'm sure you have a really good explanation. Yes. Isn't it clear to you that comic book is just another part of youth culture? It will do absolutely nothing to get you closer to the Lord. No. But even if it is, that doesn't give you any right to destroy my personal property. Jack, if you give in to the temptations of this world, it just makes it easier for Satan to find just a weakness, a vice, and squeeze. Okay? Why does he have so much power? Who gave him this power? God? Well, no. No no, of course not. Then why? Why would God allow Satan to exist? Why put us all at risk? Why, if He loved us? Well, it's because of us. It's our sin. It's the sin of Adam and Eve. We give Satan his power. It's us. My grandfather died last month. Yes, I know. I'm sorry. It's okay. I just wonder where he is now. Is he in purgatory? Is he suffering? We suffer in purgatory so that we can be cleansed of our sins. Before he died, he told me to get away from here, the community, as fast as I could. He loved me. Yeah, I think maybe we should have this conversation with your parents present, after camp. Hey. Hey yourself, Christian. What are you doing in these woods? My name's not Christian. I'm from the camp. Yeah? The Christian camp, Christian? Hey, what's going on? You take care, Christian. And remember who these woods belong to. Inbred pricks. Jack, language, please. Come on, Tommy. Let's reset the flag. You got it. Damn right, you got it. You know, even Judas was loyal for a little while. # I got the joy joy joy joy # # Down in my heart. # - # Where? # - # Down in my heart... # You're a piece of work, seriously. How are we looking, boys? Hey, Christian, what do you think the chances are of us getting down to that amusement park in town? Slim to ha-ha. Well, I like corn dogs. Jimmy. It's been years since I've been to an amusement park. You hear that, Christian? Tommy hasn't been to an amusement park in years. Yeah, not since my grandpa took me. His grandpa, Christian, his dead grandpa. It's funny actually: he used to tell my parents that he was taking me to mass, but then we'd go to Coney Island instead. They still don't know. Is this the same grandpa who told you to get as far away from the community as possible? Yeah. Well, I can see now the kind of influence he was in your life. Whoa, that's out of line. Excuse me, is that something to be encouraged... mortal sin? I didn't say that, but it's his grandfather. Have some compassion. - Why do you have to be so negative, Jack? - I don't know, Tim. Maybe your dad's new no-psych rule got me a little bit bitter. Hey, it's not just my dad. All the leaders agreed to it, and not just here. Communities all over the world are adopting the new rule. It's what's best for the community. Yes, best for the community, but the poorhouse for us. Jack, it's... - Whoa, look at that. - What? - The statue... it was to the right before. - So? Creepy things going on. Let's go. You know, the dying wish of a central figure is very difficult to overcome. Now we need young men like Thomas. We can't afford to let him go. I will protect you. I will protect you. It was when my grandmother was staying with us... my father's mother. She was dying. She had Alzheimer's... dementia. My father would sit at her bedside each night and say the rosary. As she got worse and she would spit at him, curse, stuff like that. So one night he got up to get some holy water to sprinkle on her. And just as he was about to, the phone rang. So he picked up the receiver and he said he heard a voice he didn't recognize. And it was like a child's voice, high-pitched, agitated, like there were marbles in its mouth. And the voice had said, "Leave her alone!" My father asked who he was speaking to and there were just these grunting and grinding-teeth noises. And the voice got more agitated... and said, "We're warning you! Leave her alone!" My father hung up the phone and just... he blessed the entire room with the holy water. And he sat down and began to pray the rosary. And as soon as he did, the phone rang. And he just let it ring. And it rang and rang until he got so frustrated that he just pulled the phone right out of the wall. And it was quiet for a minute. And he sat down. And as soon as he made the sign of the cross, the phone rang. I have never been so scared in my whole life. It happened every night... every night. My father, before he would go into her room, would unplug every phone in the house. And as soon as he went to make the sign of the cross, the phones would ring, all of them. It was that way until she died. I felt them before. What? Brothers, it's time to rise and serve the Lord. Mm, let's get 'er done, boys. The Lord needs rising and serving. I'm psyched. # Come, Holy Ghost # # Creator blest # # And in our hearts # # Take up Thy rest # # Come with Thy grace # # And heavenly aid # # To heal the hearts # # Which Thou hast made # # To fill the hearts # - # Which Thou hast made. # - Oh. Brothers, I cannot stress this emphatically enough. Now your sexuality, if not submitted to the will of God, can and will be your demise. Now it begins with your imagination, fantasies. And then it manifests itself in masturbation and finally takes hold of you in sexual debauchery. Now these are grave, damnable sins. You cannot enter the kingdom of heaven if you masturbate even once without confessing. In heavy petting with a sister... or a brother, for that matter... if you achieve orgasm, it is the same as premarital intercourse. Now be on your guard. Remain chaste. Your very souls are at stake. Hi. How's it going? Let us thank God for this wonderful meal lovingly prepared. Please join hands. Dear Lord, thank you for this meal placed before us. Thank you for those who prepared it for us. Bless them for their selfless sacrifice. And bless this congregation, this fellowship, as we now celebrate your goodness. - Amen. - Amen. Oh, Father, I... Thomas, you wanted to see me? Yes, I wanted to talk to you. Meet me in the chapel after dinner then, all right? Thomas, come. "This is the cup of my blood." This chalice was a gift... of my ordination. Go on, take it. Hold it. It's the divine. In your hands you hold the vessel for the divine... the blood of our Lord. At this altar God Himself is manifested... His flesh, His blood... through me, His priest. That's pretty intense. Yes, that's a good word for it... intense. A good word. What's it like? What, consecrating the Eucharist? Yeah. It's... it's like being let in on a secret, a glimpse of the majestic, something that we can't fully grasp, but we know that it's bigger than us. It's humbling to be part of that magic, that mystery. Every day, every time I do my part in the consecration of the Eucharist, it's new. It's like a lover's first kiss. That's the wonder of the priesthood. It's a magnificent life, Thomas. Have you ever considered it? - Me? - Mm-hmm. No. I don't think they'd let me in. What is it, Thomas? You'll think I'm crazy. Hardly. I've been having these dreams... nightmares really. In all of them there has been this creature... this demon. It's in your dreams, you say? But then when I wake, it's like it's still with me. I feel like I'm losing my mind, Father. I'm aware of cases of demonic oppression. They're rare, but they happen. And they can be horrifying. So if this happens to you again, I want you to come to me immediately, doesn't matter what time. You understand? Yes, Father. Bow your head. Come on, run like you mean it. Over here, over here. - Are you okay? - You're in. It's really bad. I have to go to the nurse. You want me to come with you? No, I'm fine. All right. Give 'em hell, Jimmy. You can rest here for a while. These might make you a little loopy. But the dance is tonight. You'll be there. Rest now. Lord Jesus, bless this child. Heal him, Lord. Welcome to the dance. Okay. Now, brothers and sisters, tonight you're gonna be so happy, because tonight's dance is a square dance! Huh? Okay. The shortest to tallest. We're gonna go Davids over here, Goliaths over there, okay? Jack, shirt... tuck it in. Jack, come on. All right. This is gonna be great. Square dance night! Look at those smiles. You love to square... I know you love to square dance. Come on. Tommy. Promenade! Promenade! Do si do! Hey. Where were you? I was... I was at the nurse. I had another asthma attack and I fell asleep. Oh, are you okay? I missed you. Looked like you had good enough of a time. I would have given anything to have been with you. Meet me tonight. What? How? Meet me. Have Jack cover for you. Are you crazy? Do you know what would happen to us if we got caught? I know. I don't care. I want to see you. Meet me. Okay. by the horse paddocks. Okay. What are you two doing out here in the dark? We were just talking. He was sick and... Sister, you go to your cabin now. You're behaving like a tramp. Excuse me? A whore. Acting like a whore out here in the cloak of darkness with a young man. People will think of you as a whore. Good night, Melissa. I can't tell you how disappointed I am in you, Thomas. Hey. I didn't think I was gonna make it out of there. A couple of the counselors were gabbing away on the front porch blocking my exit. I thought the horses were gonna give me away. Where's Tommy? Uh, I think he's at the nurse... his asthma, you know. F.Y.I., Jesus is your savior, not your homeboy. Funny. How's the Inquisition treating you, Christian? My dad told me that your parents were thinking about leaving. Is that true? How does word like that get around so fast? I swear, this community, for all its piousness, really do gossip more than a cheap supermarket rag. So it's true then? Well, yeah. I mean, they're just thinking about it, but... Here, let's sit. Why though? No one knows this, but my dad's in A.A. Really? Before his conversion, he used to be a really bad alcoholic. And my parents almost got divorced over it. I had no idea. I'm sorry. Well, now with this new rule, they've ordered my dad to stop going and my mom wanted none of it. But if you guys leave... You know how it is when someone leaves, how they're treated. Suddenly my parents will be lost to the world, the flesh and the devil. And what will become of their whore daughter? I can't believe he called you that. Me neither. Why didn't you say something? It's Father Phineas. Are you crazy? No. Not if you felt that he was wrong... so wrong for calling me that. I know. I should have said something. I'm sorry, Mel. Remember how much fun it used to be when we were kids? We'd have prayer meetings followed by picnics lasting into the night. Oh, I used to have so much fun. I loved it. I met you at one of those picnics for the first time. You were, what, like, eight or nine? Yeah, eight, I think. You were all cute, all tongue-tied. You've always had that effect on me. Oh God, Mel. Oh my God. I'm going to... Tommy. Oh God. Stay with me. Stay with me. Are you happy with your life, Father? And you, my priest, have failed me, just like you have always failed. Your time is up. My God, I can't believe that just happened. Me neither. Did you? What? Eww. Sticky. We hardly touch each other all summer, and then... wow. That was intense. - Did you hear that? - Yeah, I did. Shit, we can't get caught like this. Stay low. Stay low. I can't believe we just did that. Don't tell anyone. Tommy, I don't regret it. Please don't make this a bad thing. I care about you so much. I won't tell anyone. I can't even imagine the things they would say about you. I'll wait here a couple of minutes and then I'll follow you, okay? I don't want them to see us coming out together. Go. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. Bad girl. - Why aren't you with your campers? - One of them is missing. - Who? - Tommy Leary. Come on. - Sister, what's happening? - I'm just getting bits and pieces. Seems that they all had the same nightmare... blood in the chapel or something. Sisters, be at peace. Calm. No harm will come to you. Father, protect these sisters. Take away all evil thoughts, all fear of the enemy. Melissa, what are you still doing dressed? Tommy? Tommy. Tommy, stop. Stay here. Oh my God. - Are you okay? - The inhaler. - Where is it? - The nurse's. Okay, all right, I'll get it. Carol, is he all right? He's better. It was quite a scare though. Asthma can be pretty awful. Yes, it sure can. Oh, I need to see him. Of course, of course. But he's pretty tuckered. And he can't speak. The medicine really needs to do its work. Can this wait till the morning? I don't see why not. Anyway, thank you for your service tonight. Bless you. I'm just going to stay with him and pray for a while. Then I'll be on my way. Good night. Good night, Father. Don't speak, Thomas. And in the morning when you feel better, we need to talk. I know you're not responsible for the desecration in the chapel, but there were things that happened tonight. You know what I speak of. You will tell me. Understand? "This is my body that will be given up for you." And when the supper had ended, He took the cup... He gave the cup to his disciples and said, "This is the cup of my blood... the blood of the new and everlasting covenant. Do this in remembrance of me." Hey Tommy. Take this. It's from Melissa. She got it to me through one of the girls in her cabin. Look, I gotta run. Mass just got out. But are you okay? What happened? Yeah. I'm fine. I gotta go shower. Yeah. All right, I'll catch up with you. Yeah, I'll tell you later. Can I read it? No. All right. See you. "Tommy, when you're ready, when you can, come back to me." What were you doing out of your cabin last night? I was sick... my asthma. Yes, I know that, but there just happened to be someone else out of her cabin last night too. Were you with her? Who? Oh, come on, Thomas, don't play games with me. I don't know what you're talking about, Father. Very well. What were you doing in the chapel last night? I saw it, Father. Saw what? The demon. When did you first start experiencing this? All I know... it started after my grandfather passed away. This is the grandfather that would take you to the amusement park instead of taking you to church, right? Hmm? Yeah. Were you close to him? Very. I'm sorry for your loss, son. But... I'm not going crazy, Father. I've seen this before. And what happened to him? Where is he? He's at a mental institution. He tried to take his life and the life of his young sister. Why would God allow this? God's will cannot be questioned by our feeble minds. God's will is this? Thomas, nothing on this earth happens without God's permission. Now He tests us within our own limitations. He gives us the means and the sacraments and the grace to combat the enemy, because the enemy is brutal. But it's your choice to take that which He offers. Now I can help you. But you have to listen to me and do what I say. I'll do whatever it takes. Here, sit over here. Yeah. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. How long has it been since your last confession? Several months. Now go on. In the time since my last confession, I have lied. I have lied to my parents. What about sins of the flesh? Yes, Father. Mm-hmm. I've had impure thoughts. Do you masturbate? Yes. Yes, Father. How often? Once every other day. I don't know. Well, you invite the evil one into your imagination. Every time you masturbate, you open the door. Do you understand that? Yes. What about Melissa? Were you with her? Thomas, you cannot make a good confession if you withhold a sin that you have knowledge of. You will not achieve absolution. Now were you with her? Yeah. Well, this is a serious violation. Did you commit sin with her? Thomas. We kissed, that's all. She's a good person. Are you certain that's all? The sin remains if you do not confess it. I know. All right. All right, for your penance you will no longer be a part of the rest of the camp. You will spend the remainder of time here in prayer and in service. And I will have to tell your parents what you've done. But since you have revealed this to me during a confession, I must ask your permission. Now may I tell them? I'd prefer if you wouldn't. Thomas, none of this is going to be easy... none of it. Okay. I am disgusted by you. Do you have any idea of the shame that you have brought upon me, on my name, on your mother? Do you? I'm sorry. "You're sorry" means nothing. Those are hollow words, Tommy... hollow words. Now you listen to Father. And there'd better be a change. Or if there isn't, God help you. Your mother would like to speak with you. Tommy. I'm here. What have you done, Tommy? Mom. Yes? Mom, please... Oh, Tommy. Enough. Don't you dare try and elicit sympathy. You will find none here... none. You have done this. You listen to Father. You be a man or don't come home, Tommy. I'm so sorry. I need to get my glove. What's up, son? Nothing. You know, I think I might sneak out to that amusement park during entertainment tonight. I got a hankering for them funnel cakes. And there's a rollercoaster they got there that's sick. Care to join me, Padawan? I'm in lockdown. Really? For what? I got caught. - With Melissa? - Yeah. Shit. Was Father Phallic pissed? - You could say that. - Damn. You shouldn't, you know. What? Leave. It's against the rules. Whoa, mini-Christian. Slow down. Are you all right? Pray for me, Jack. - Can I help you, Officer? - Is this one of your campers? Yes, Officer. What happened? He got tangled up with some of the local kids at the amusement park... some of our bad element in town. They put a pretty bad beating down on him, from what we understand. Are you all right? He's lucky. A good Samaritan took notice, intervened, caught a couple of the kids, put a pretty good scare into them. One of them confessed to the vandalism you had up here. A unit's retrieving the cross they stole right now. Oh, that's wonderful news. Yeah, well, I'm a little concerned... a kid his age out and about, unsupervised. But we called his parents and they said to bring him back here. Well, thank you. Thank you. Come on, help me get the last few. Then I'll cut you loose for the night. He'll be all right. They pinned me down and tagged me with this. What happened? Those inbreds you got into it with in the woods... they jumped me at the amusement park and beat the crap out of me. Well, now you know why we have the rules that we have. Yeah, those dickheads got into it with one of the community members at a diner about a year back. They've been waiting for us to come back ever since, 'cause their parents told them they were going to hell. I guess there's not much to do in the sticks. Yeah, well, you should take joy in knowing that you were persecuted for your brothers and sisters, Jack. Are you kidding me? I could care less about the brothers and sisters. How can you say that after all that we've done for you? What have you... what have you done for me? Turned your back on my family, made my father out to be some sort of witch doctor? For years the leaders of this community... his father... - Jack, that is not fair. ...demanded that my dad keep his caseload of non-community members low so he could have time for the brothers and sisters. Oh, but after you decided it's encroaching on your mind control, that's it. Where does that leave us? Where does that leave my family? - Jack, you are out of line. Stop. - Shut up, Christian! I'm supposed to listen to you? You're my role model? A 23-year-old lackey spewing out whatever they tell you, not having a goddamn thought of your own? Look at you. Look at your nails. Come on, let's see them. You chew on them like a little girl, you're so turned around by... Oh God, stop it. Stop stop stop. Jack, Jack, stop. - What are you doing? - Are you okay? Get out of here. Get out! You have no place here. Yeah, you know what? You're damn right about that. Tommy. Tommy. What time is it? I don't know. Around 2:00. I'm out of here, dude. What? How? My dad's here. My parents flipped. I think we're done with this place. God. Really? You keep your head about you. You'll get through this, all right? Are you gonna be okay? Hell yeah. They strike me down, I'll only come back more powerful than ever before. Take care. I'll see you on the other side. All right, yeah. # Ave Maria... # # Ave Maria... # The world attacks us using our pride or avarice and secular humanism as its church. And the flesh makes us weak to lustful temptations. But the devil uses both to attack our minds. See, the devil knows our psyche and how it works better than we do. He uses the weakness of our minds to drive us to anger and fear, despair. St. John of the Cross was often oppressed by the devil. And in his "Dark Night" he discusses the tortures of the demon. This is what he says: "When the spiritual communication is not bestowed exclusively on the spirit but on the senses too, the devil more easily disturbs and agitates this spirit with these horrors by means of the senses. The torment and pain he then causes is immense and it is sometimes ineffable, for since it proceeds nakedly from spirit to spirit, the horror of the evil spirit causes within the good spirit, if he reaches the spiritual part, is unbearable." Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death, amen. # Ave # # Maria. # Father? Thomas, I... I just... I thought I'd check in on you. Are you free from sin? Yes, Father. Haven't masturbated? No. Excellent. You're becoming a true and faithful servant. I'm very proud of all you've accomplished. Thank you, sir. Now go back to prayer. I'll see you later. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death, amen. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Oh, I'll get it. Wait wait wait. Wait for me, Rose. - Dr. John is here. - Thank you, honey. Hi John. Patricia. Jack, what happened to your face? Michael. Why aren't you at camp? My son has something you guys need to hear. When Tommy first told me about this, I thought he might be going a little loony. You know, I know I don't always go along with the community, but I still believe in God and the devil. What exactly are you saying, Jack? Hey, Jack, why don't you go and wait in the car for me, please? Look, Tommy's my best friend and I'm really worried about him. You gotta listen to me for a second, Michael. I've seen this before. Father Phineas is a good man and he's done so much for the community, but I fear... I fear he's somehow linked to this. I know you're having trouble with the elders at this point... - Michael... ...but to suggest... Please let him talk. Please. There was this boy... Daniel. He was an altar boy from Father Phineas's parish, not much different than Tommy. But the kid had problems. He had very real problems. Father Phineas sent him to me because... well, because the boy claimed that he was being haunted by a demon. You see, the mind... the mind can do amazing things. But what I saw with this boy was... it was something I never want to see again. That's when I determined that Daniel's affliction was far more than psychological. It had to be spiritual. So Father Phineas took on the spiritual... the spiritual care of the boy, and I assisted. Father Phineas... the way he cared for Daniel, the way he focused on the guilt and the sin... it only gave the demon more power, more control. What happened to the boy... to Daniel? Patricia, your Tommy is a good boy and he has both of you. What happened to Daniel... Just tell us what happened to him. One night he... he locked himself and his little sister, who was no older than Rose, in the bathroom of their home and he slit her wrists. And then he slit his own. And only by some miracle were they found in time. I will never forgive myself. What about the church? Didn't the church intercede... an exorcism? They wouldn't. See, Daniel was being oppressed. He wasn't possessed. The church has a very specific definition for possession, certain criteria in order for the rite of exorcism to be performed. Daniel didn't meet that criteria. So he was left to the care of Father Phineas and I. And we failed. What does this have to do with my son, John? I fear the demon is trying to revisit the success it had in destroying Daniel by using the same strategy with Tom. And in Father Phineas, I fear, the demon has found an unknowing accomplice. Open the door, Rose! Rose, please open! Rose! Rose! Baby, baby. Baby. What is it, baby? What is it? It's okay. It's okay. Shh, it's okay. It's okay. Brothers, I know that the past couple of days at this camp have been difficult. It's clear now that the evil one is at work in our lives. Tonight we will do battle against him. Tonight we will cast him out. Let us pray for each other. Pick a brother and ask him to pray over you. Lord, we cast Satan out in Jesus's name. We cast Satan out in Jesus's name. Pray for me, Tommy. Pray that I might be strong, that I might be holy. We cast Satan out in Jesus's name. We cast Satan out in Jesus's name. - We cast Satan out in Jesus's name. - No. No, stop. No, stop. No, stop. - Tim, what is it? - No, get away. - Tim, Tim, what is it? - No, make it stop. Stop. No. Oh. - Tim, what is it? - What's that smell? I saw the devil. I saw a demon. I don't know what I saw. It was so real. The prophecy of the Lord: Fear not, my children, for I am with you. I will not let a hair on your head be harmed. I love you, for the evil one has no... What's going on? Stop! Stop! I hate you! Oh! What's that? Argh! What happened? What happened? What happened? I don't know. He just... Go to my cabin. Now! It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. What have you not told me? Father, I lied. You endanger us all. You treat your sin with devil-may-care indifference. I tell you, he does care. He does. I didn't mean to hurt anybody. I take it on myself... Confess confess confess confess. Now what happened with you and Melissa out in the woods? You haven't told me the truth. What happened? Did you have intercourse with her? No, Father, no. Tell me. Tell me. Now say it. Say it. We brought each other to orgasm, Father. That's all. That's all? And you accept sin in your life... you and your whore? She's not a whore. She's a whore! And you... you are devil's spawn. James's teeth are shattered. Timothy lies in his own excrement. And Daniel's in an asylum. And all those roads come back to you. Now tell me when... when? When did you let sin into your life? Was it your grandfather? Did he open the door? No. No, he was a good man. My grandfather was a good... He gave you to the demon. He loved me! I love you. No! Tommy, Tommy, stop stop stop stop. Slow down. Slow down. Where's Father? Where... where's...? It has to be. You said that you would protect me. Protect me. Protect me, protect me, protect me. Tommy. Help me. Please. I don't want this. Enough. Enough. Can you hear me? Tommy? Can you hear me? Tommy. Hey. There you are. Where? Shh, don't speak. You're in the hospital. You had a severe asthma attack. We almost lost you. Where's Father Phineas? He's here. He's here. He had a stroke. They don't... Hey, how are you doing? You scared me. You look good. Father's here. I found him out in the hallway. He was doing his rounds. Would you give my son the Eucharist, Father? Of course. The body of Christ. Tommy. Tommy, receive, son. No. Maybe I should... No no, Father. Please. Your son has been through a lot tonight. Perhaps it's best to leave it alone. It's okay. I don't want to receive anymore, Mom. If it really is the body of Christ, it's too terrible to imagine. And if it isn't, then it's all just a big lie. I can't believe anymore, Mom. I can't. I won't. I can go to your school and I can follow your rules, but you can't make me believe. It's too awful. I need to be free of this. Oh God. Enough. Oh baby. Enough. Shh. We can't pull the plug. God can heal him. "See you soon." Thank you.
