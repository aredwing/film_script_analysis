Only defense against them, the wolfers. Professional hunters, descendants perhaps, in the tradition, of those warriors to whom the ancient inhabitants would entrust the protection of their lives and their property in exchange for maintenance. Even now, when they kill a wolf, they take it with a cart around the villages of the mountain to gather the poor things that the shepherds can give them as payment. Silent and strong, like the mountains among which they grew up, wolfers a bit by need, and much by atavistic passion, these men have preserved intact, of their precursors, an indomitable spirit of independence that prevents them from having a master. They are nomads. They appear at first frosts, and mysteriously disappear at the melting of the snow, like the beasts with which they have supported through the winter the relentless struggle. Go straight, and you're right in the square. Thank you. And excuse the disturbance. Teresa! We arrived. Wake up, Pasqualino! Let him sleep, I'll carry him in my arms. - Better if he walks, so he warms up. Pasqualino, wake up. Come on, Pasqualino! You see how much snow? You felt cold, kid? - No. I dreamed I was at the beach! See how grueling it is? It was better if you'd stayed at the village. You would have sent for me after 10 days, as you always did. I know you don't like to always come after me. Ah, sometimes I think I have two children instead of one! The City of Vischio makes known to all citizens that it will pay the sum of 20,000 lire to who will kill a wolf. If it is a female, this will yield 5,000 lire more. Because females are worse, they give birth to other wolves. They're always up against females! - 20,000 lire! It's little. Let's try at Corvino! Maybe they pay more. They won't pay more! They weigh more than a cow. - Come on! Well, they eat more than us! Take it easy, they're not sacks of potatoes. Excuse me, is still alive Nazareno the wolfer? He's over there, just past the corner. - Thanks. Try to buy a sheep for the leghold traps. Dad could send them when they could go on foot, we wouldn't spend all this money on trucks. They live the ladies' lives! Winter at sea and mountains all summer. Better off than me. Better than you? You are the daughter of the owner! What do you lack? Everything! You always arrive when it's done! Fortunately Dad's not there. Listen. Mind you, the sheep are counted. - So? - Don't sell them along the road! Then, you have some money to lend to your little brother, huh? You think I don't know where this is going to end? But I want it back, got it? And mind the sheep, don't be stupid! Yes, I know! Close. Excuse me, can you sell me a sheep? Maybe ill, a reject. We need it to lure the wolves to the traps. We have only good animals. And the sheep, we buy, we don't sell. Oh, our craft is over, my man! But I... I have the passion. Today, if you want to earn on a wolf, you must take him alive. And then you sell it to a zoo. If only! I'm here about ten days. If there are no wolves, I'll go farther. There are, there are... and you know it. Come on, you're a brigand more than your dad, can tell by your face. Come in. You can settle here. It 's just what I wanted. We're three. - Three wolfers? No! But I have my wife and my son. - And you take along the wife? In my time, the women, we sought them in the mountains! But at least, your wife is beautiful? That's why I married her! She had not even a blouse! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo, so you did sooner to undress her. And for the rent? - What rent, you fool! Come on, leave this stuff and go call your wife. Come on, go on! Go! Are you wolfers? Yes. - And can't you send these blessed wolves elsewhere? But you can't control the wolf! When there are wolves, our shepherds run away like hares! To each his own trade! If your husband agrees, I give you lodging, I give you 3 quintals of flour, plus wine and cheese. I'll give you like him! And even pasta twice a week. And the meat for the traps, who will provide it? I want to go broke, I'll give it, if you come with me. What's up? - We bargained with your wife to have a wolfer. The place I have it already. I don't need anyone. Wow! What nasty temper! - With that wife, he's right. At least there's the bed. What do women think about, first of all? The bed! Give me a hand! This is fine as bait, dad? - No. The wolf is hungry for meat, not for cheese. The wolf always walks against the wind, and sniffs the air. And, if he doesn't smell meat, he doesn't come close. Run to the tobacconist's and get me a cigar. Teresa, give him the money. But I, when do I start smoking? Ah yes, she's a beautiful wife. And works hard, even! Of course! He does the artist! How sorry I am that you have to make do in here! What could we find better? A more human job, you could find. But it's a bad time! No. It's that you like better this one. I'm not going back home, for sure! Tell him I'm dead! - And you leave me all alone? - It's your problem! My God, how sad! - Poor beasts! Luckily I didn't let go mine! Go call Don Pietro. - No, no, I don't have the guts! See how many they are. - Ours too will end up this way? Not even with dogs they can be saved this year! I heard them, the wolves, last night. - I told them not to go! Poor beasts, they're still warm. - To attack a truck, they must be hungry! Of course! It's too cold. This year, the wolves are worse than in past years. How many wolves were? - Five. But look what precision. All at the throat. Oh, yeah! Wolves never fail. But who's that guy? I think is the surveyor who came last year. But, a surveyor has a rifle? - Hush, here comes Don Pietro! Amerigo! Amerigo! What's the matter? Go away, okay? For a few sheep, it's not the end of the world! Beppino, Fausto! Take away this stuff! Amerigo, you're here! You've been afraid of wolves, huh? What ugly beasts! Hush, hush, Dad. Don't talk about it, for God's sake! I knew it would end up like this. - If he were my son! You left the truck in the street to go to Carmela, huh? And what should a young man do in this town? The monk? Well... Luckily I shot! - Who are you, what do you want? If I hadn't arrived, not one sheep would be saved. Shut up, you! I'm not afraid of wolves, let alone of him! Nice gratitude! You're a wolfer, you? Why, don't you see? We too are here for the wolves! Damn, a cartridge belt like an organ! Not like yours, Dad! Pasqualino! Come, we still have to find the meat for the wolves. You already caught any? - Here, not yet. Goodbye. - Bye. And if you see the wolves, don't squeal that I'm here! Listen, girl, there is a tavern here? - There it is! Come on, I'll pay you a drink. What a honey you are! One sees she doesn't like wine. I'll go along with you! What's your name? Ricuccio. You look like a horse. - Well, get on then! Come on! Doctor, can't even see the bites of wolves. It's excellent meat. I've even cooked a kilo for myself. You can sell them only at the price of low-grade slaughter. And what I do with that? Well, it's not my fault! Take care. - Regards, Doctor. Regards, Doctor. It takes the wolves to eat meat for cheap. I'd reward the wolf, and not who catches him. It's an hour that I look for you! Where were you? - He was in good hands. Come on, let's start! - Come. - Hurry up! Look here, at 150 lire per kilo for such a meat! You have sent for me. My land starts at the oak and ends at the valley. I give to eat for as long as there is snow. You'll put traps around my property and watch my cattle. There are 50 horses, 30 cows and 300 sheep. Oh! Not bad, though! Tonight you sleep here, and tomorrow you go to the farm. And the wolf, whose is it? If you catch him, is yours. I want the wine, too. All right! But, if the wolf kills me another animal, mind you... Calm down! I am not yet under you! And I am wolf, not a sheep! So then, I can take this? And the money, you've got it? We'll pay when my husband gets the wolf, with the reward. May be even tomorrow! It suits you more that me, no? But, who's at your service, me or her husband? What you got to do with it? The boss is him! More wolfers there are, the better for everyone. And if you don't catch the wolf? We'll get him, we'll get him... Escort him, Bianca. Hey! Is it long that you're serving in this house? Since I was born. So then you're born servant. Poor thing! A cute pie like you, huh? Change your tune, it's better! And which tune would you like? - Huh...The bed is up here. Before, there was the mill. Here is for washing up. The soap is here. There should also be a towel somewhere. For tonight you have to make do. Two blankets are enough for you? - Sure! Listen. What do you want? But the bed, who makes it? Make it yourself. Come here... I'll leave the door open. But, don't you come too late, huh? For, I have a great need to sleep. I'm going to tell my father! Your father? He too is serving in this house? I'm the daughter of the owner, you get it or not? But why all the dirt? - To take the stink off him. Why, your father stinks? Man smells like man. If you don't confuse him with another smell, the wolf doesn't go to the trap. Got it? But why the wolf can smell our stink, and we can not smell his? Then he would no longer be a wolf! And what's the sheep for? Now my mother binds her to the donkey and drags her into the country. So the wolf smells the sheep, follows her, and is caught in the trap. OK? - Pasqualino, let's go. Whatever you ask him, he always replies stink. He's a priest of word, huh? - Yeah. You'll see if it's true that wolves will start to howl! It 's open. You heard? He's making sound the death knell! Says that the wolves will jump out. He still believes in these tales. But who told you? Have you talked to him? No, why? Said so a shepherd of Don Pietro. Is that enough? No, collect some more. Tonight I'll stay here. Was it wise to bring out the animals? - Sure. Wasn't enough a dead sheep, as did the other wolfer? That's a comedian! He gets greasy in the square, shows off... Luring wolves with a herd of cows or with a sheep's carcass? Come on! There! These, by making many, if you send them to Africa, you can make lots of money! Taste it. Taste! Fresh? Teresa! I've waited for them all night. Nothing! They went round me, but never came within range. Yet they are hungry. Come on, lie down. You're too tired to eat now. You'd better eat later. I also brought you the cigars. It's all here. Open! Get dressed, or I'll call people. What a hard life they make you do! Don't get fresh with me! Here, I command! Yes, yes... You command on sheep, cows and chickens. But men, you command them little! Get dressed, chatterbox! I want to call you Cinderella. If I were your father I would be ashamed. Up and down all day long, to load stuff like a jackass. Why? You know a better life? My own! And what's better in it? Although I toil all day, I'm a lady and you a starving. You see only cheese, apples... and hams! And you? - I? But I travel the world! I have fun! I make love with whom I like... Whereas you, in a few years, you'll be already old, with the life you lead. Understand? Listen! But, you've never seen... a ship? Rigoletto? Why don't we get married? You put in the money, and I'll teach you how to live. Even with mine and my father's money, you'd stay a drifter. Ricuccio! My brother! - But why so much fear? You haven't done anything wrong, yet. Ricuccio! I proposed her to marry me, but she said I was too poor. Go on, jest, you! But why don't you go hunting, instead of sleeping and scrounging meals? He even shaves, every morning! But if there's no wolves, is it my fault? - Should they visit you at home? Is it still snowing? No. It stopped. I can't take it anymore, Don Amerigo! Every morning I must heat the water! He washes worse than a woman! Even talcum powder, like children! Even doing the wolfer has become a toil! Giovanni! Giovanni! Just from us you come to steal the meat? You deserve it! This time, I laugh! But you could've fired, no? Shoot! Shoot! But... But it was already too far away! I wouldn't have even hit it. I... I can't get to rest a moment. We await wolves, and we get eagles. It takes another sheep! We are left only 3,000 lire, and we're full of debts! And in town they say the wolves are gone! - But you trust the others or me? It just takes the bait. And you, you're looking for? I? Nothing! I walk around... This guy is always where you are. Come on, Tommy, walk! One day or the other he would die in the street! By now he stays up by a miracle! I bet even he has no desire to keep on living. Oh, if I too could find someone to kill me! We're old, what do we live for? We are no longer good for anything! Come on, Tommy. Sit here. See what life is like! We killed so many wolves together, and now, who would have said that you would end up as bait for those nasty beasts! Move away, Nazareno! You won't look at me, huh? You don't want to say goodbye! You're right, you are right! But it's better this way, believe me, Tommy. If you gotta shoot, hurry up! Hurry! Hold on, Giovanni! I want to shoot him myself. It's up to me. The dog is mine. Daddy, don't shoot! I found this sheep dead in a ditch. Maybe killed by the wolves. - Here. We'll put this in the traps. So we don't kill Tommy. Let's go home, Tommy. You saw how my hand was shaking? I wouldn't have even hit you. Come on, let's go home, old buddy. Poor Tommy! What did they mean to do to him? You do nothing but steal! You've made disappear that sheep! But who told you it was me? Who? You made us spend millions to study! You've only learned to snatch money to give to women! You're crazy. Shut up, stupid! And you, stop playing! Will you stop it? You're always thinking about money, huh? And what else should I think of? It 's the only thing I have. And you cry on it, too! Amerigo won't let me marry to not divide the property. And dad agrees with him. And you, out of spite, get married with me! - Yeah, nice deal! The sheep... I stole it! You too... what did you come here to do? Couldn't you go to another village? You'd better go. Now dad will chase you away. Shoot! He ripped his paw to avoid being caught. He screwed you! Yes! But he won't go too far. Ricuccio! He got one! And where is he? - At the square. It is a wolf long like this! A male! You sure it's a wolf? - Of course! It's one of those who attacked the cows. I followed the tracks and I killed him. Where did you kill him? At the broken bridge. - With buckshot? - But of course, buckshot! Look at the holes. - Nice luck! But how did you do? Wolves are like lightnings! There lies the skill. A single shot, and... A single shot? - But what are you telling? But you want from me? There's fools even among wolves, right? Let's hear what these say. For me, it's the dog of Luigi the Australian, his name is Goofy. Were he alive, I would call him. - Can't you smell the stink of wild? It 'a wolf! What wolf! If we're not careful, this guy will kill all the dogs in town. Mine is white. - Yeah! If they paint him! You understand what a shot? - And he'll grab the reward! Enough to do a honeymoon! What have you got to laugh? Now you have to explain! Better not. Better for you. Try to catch a wolf like that, if you can! - Come on, leave him alone. Come on, I'm waiting! This is the paw that a wolf has left in a trap. Who did you want to cheat? Just look at the legs and you'll see that it's not a wolf, that it's a dog! Study it! I don't want any cheaters in my house! Shut the door! Forget about it! He's more trouble than he's worth. You're right. Oh, well! We're many doing nothing. One more, one less... Yeah, let's drink on it! ... to my service. You put leghold traps around my property in the mountains, and I give you room and board. No, thank you. I don't obey anyone. The traps, I put them where they must be put. At night, you'd be warm in my house, with your wife, your son. They are accustomed. If you want also some money, well, we won't surely argue for this. My job has only one thing that's nice: that one always does his own way, you live in the open air! And animals don't ever give you disappointments. They're not like men! My father used to say: I have only one master... Nature! But this is pride! Think about what I give you, instead. House, eating, money. I do not want masters. But let go, dad! Don't you see he's worse than a mule? Come on, let's go. If you change your mind, come see me. You know what it would take, Tere'? That I'd catch the wolf alive. Well, then yes! for the reward of the municipality, They'll take him for sure! Add the gifts from the people,... and we're alright. We'd be tranquil throughout the year! You will rest, you'll do the lady! And you want to take him alive just for this? Also for the satisfaction. Satisfaction is when you live like humans, and not like animals as we do. What're you doing? We're going and stay with Don Pietro, you, do as you wish. Stop, Teresa! Mind you, you'll regret it! Tere'! Tere'! You were right. It's not so much better, but is warmer. - Come on, sleep. Teresa ... You agree with me only when it suits you. I know. I never do what is right. I'd like to do as the bear. Fall asleep through the winter, and not think about anything. I, rather, wouldn't want to fall asleep ever. I always have bad dreams. But fortunately I have you. There's the child. He's growing up like a beast. Poor thing, he might do well. He stopped at the letter M. I was glad if at least he had learned to write his name. We'll send him to school next year. You think that I don't care as well? There's never a moment that we're alone. He's asleep... When I hug you, you're no longer good at being bully. A true wolfer doesn't take a dog and passes him off as a wolf! And who says that I am a true wolfer? But, where are you from? Who knows! From the north, from the south... hunger doesn't drive only wolves. But a job, you don't have it? Even too many! I got so many humiliations since I was born... But I'm still not used to that! If you want, I'll teach you to hunt wolves for real. Stay with me. Who's moving... Sleep as well, since Giovanni won't come back here. It's always women the ones who rule. Go away! There's me here, now! Oh! It's you! You haven't said a word to defend me. And to think that I didn't kill your father only out of consideration for you. I brought you dinner. Don't thank me even? And why? With your father, the terms were clear: lunch, dinner and breakfast. Yes! But now he drove you out. Then go away! It makes me sick, your stuff! Wait! Don't you give me a kiss? Why have you come, tell me? - You already know it. I was tired of fighting. Ah! I was not wrong, huh? But if you plan to marry me, you're mistaken. My money, you won't get it. # My beauty... you're the master's daughter... # Give me, so we cover. # Let's have a home... at the bottom of this valley... # # this valley... # # The passion... takes us in our hearts... # If he goes on, this time ends badly! Enough is enough! Giovanni, let it be. I knew you would come. - If you shoot, the wolves won't come! But somehow I have to eat, now that you've stolen my place! I don't steal anything from anybody. And go away! I've always done what I like! Giovanni! No! Stop, stop! Stop it! Hold it! You're right, I'm an idiot. We're all poor fellows. Let us agree, so that at least we eat. You could've make peace! The other day, he gave us the sheep. I'm fine alone. - Alone, always alone. But there are also the others! I do not trust anyone! Don't see in what kind of world we are? You defend him because you like him! - Have you gone mad? You see only enemies. Since when I'm with you, I'm ashamed to even laugh. We are always strangers, everywhere. You like doing the martyr. I work like a beast to let you eat. What do you want more? Yes, you work. But it's a hopeless work. Right! For you, I am one who goes hunting for fun. No. But if your son and I were wolves, you'd consider us more. This, I don't deserve it. Really in conscience. What do you want, that I hang from a tree as bait? Giovanni! We made it at last! I was sure he would fall in it. It doesn't seem true, Giovanni! It doesn't seem true! Beautiful beast! It's a female! Seems pregnant. - It's so long that I wanted to take a wolf alive! But at least get help from someone. I go to town, to call people. - No! No, otherwise we must go halves! And then, I want to make it alone! Listen to me, at least once! Alright. But be quick, for soon it snows. - Yes. Don't you try and do it alone, okay? - Yes, but go. And bring Pasqualino, for he's never seen a live wolf. Come! Come on! I'll get you alone! Come here! Dad caught a she-wolf, he took her alive! Damn, just today that I wasn't there! Where was that? - About 2 km. Let's go, I'll come too. What's up? - Giovanni took a wolf alive! Giovanni! Giovanni! - Dad! I hear howling! Must be the wind. - What wind! Are wolves! It's around here, we're almost there. Mom! Giovanni? Giovanni! Giovanni! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! ...then there are two teams of beaters. A group comes from the left and the other from the right. If they can dig them out, it's done. Look. They must necessarily pass by there, they have no other way. The rest is up to us. But beware, you! It isn't easy. The shot is a bit long. Here we go! Stay calm! Nazareno! I got him, Nazareno! Come, come! But I had shot at the other one. So I missed him! But I shot at this one and I did him in. Alright that was far away, but this... Don't get mad if I tell you something, huh? In your cartridges I had put sawdust! - The usual cheat! You know, I must recover my reputation. And the other wolf? Hurry, they're back! They killed a wolf! Teresa, they say is the one of the leghold trap. I bet it was Ricuccio. Let's go see! The wolves, we must forget them. Push, Pasqualino! I had told you we had to stay here! Now the wolves can be taken. They understood that Dad is gone, and they go for walks all day! But this has all four legs. - It's not the one of the leghold trap! Is one of the herd that attacked Giovanni in the woods. You sell the skin? I'll buy it. It won't be fake this as well, no? No, this is real. I assure you myself. I too could catch a wolf as they did! They were a regiment! Giovanni went alone. Stop at my house, Ricu', I'll give you the lamb. You've earned it! Why don't we stop too? Bravo Ricuccio! - I'll give you 3 liters of oil. And us, 10 kilos of flour! What a lord with all these gifts, Ricu'! Beautiful, huh? Mom, why do you run away like that? Let's stop, Mom! Pasqualino! Where are you going? - Ricuccio! Did you see what a wolf? Teresa! Wait a minute. Just look at this. This is certainly one of the wolves that have mauled your husband. It 's yours! Yes, it's true! It's one of those who were close to Giovanni, in the woods. You don't even have to thank, Tere'. Sure, it is so! - Teresa, take it, the wolf is yours. Do you hear them? Everybody says so. The reward is for you as it would be for Giovanni. Don't be proud! This beast is yours as much as ours. What you leave you lose! Don't listen to him! Your husband would refuse. - Accept! No. She's right! She's in mourning and must respect her husband's memory. Don't accept! They must all give us something, not only here but also in nearby villages. This is how it's done, when one kills the wolf. You know that better than me. I want to help you because I am poor like you. I wouldn't feel like a man, if I didn't! Where will you go with a winter like this? We collect the gifts from the people, and meanwhile you wait here for spring. Accept, Teresa. Friendship is nicer than pride. How many days will they be away? But you hope there will be something for you? Well, depending on how it goes. - It'll be fine! Come back when the cart is full, okay? And get busy, don't be lazy! Knock door to door, as we have done here. Insist especially with the rich. The wine is there? - Yes, but no bread. The oven will turn on after tomorrow. - Borrow it from someone. She took comfort pretty soon! We already collected a lot of stuff. Rest assured, we will not die of hunger. Even if I were to steal. But now we must go on. You know, Giovanni, we'll be around so many days. Come on, help the wolfer! Yeah, the wolfer! And us, who can help us? The cold burned everything! That's all I can give. It's a bad year! Dear and beautiful friends, look at the dead wolf... lay your hand on your heart and conscience... of bread and maize no one in life can do without... no one in life can do without... Come on, all this racket for a wolf! He could kill your sheep! What do I care about wolves! Anyway, I'm going to America! But, where is Pasqualino now? Pasqualino! Don't worry, won't be far away. Pasqualino! There he is! What's he got on him? Mom, look! Two wolf cubs! How did you get them? - I had to go potty and I saw them. I ran after them holding my pants. You are more clever than a wolfer, I tell you! The she-wolf! - Let's go! - But I didn't go potty yet! Ricuccio! Ricuccio? These wolf cubs are always hungry. If I get bored, I start beating them! Milk in the morning, at noon, in the evening... We do this round just to feed them! Pasqualino! Stop, Mom! It's Ricuccio. I've been looking for you for an hour! Couldn't you wait for me? At least some regard, right? Where have you been? Get some sleep, you haven't slept a wink last night. Walk! I had to do. At a certain age, one should settle down. A girl, I found her, at Vischio. She owns half the town. If I succeed in the hit, I'm settled forever. What say you? I do well? If you like her... You know, I don't wanna keep on running after wolves all my life. If you stay poor, it means you're no good at it! You haven't got it yet? Giovanni never thought in this way. He never made these speculations. We saw it! He died like a dog for a couple of sausages and some flour. Mom! What're you doing? Get off and go away! Get away! Nice gratitude! If I wasn't there, you'd die of hunger! Yes, you're right. Giovanni was a good man. We should all be like him. But easier said than done! I don't wanna be exploited! It is I who wants to exploit others! Not even you, know what you want. You act so cunning! But you too, if you want to eat, you need a dead wolf. Ricu', she's no longer angry. Climb on! The wolfer is here! The wolfer has come! The wolfer! The wolfer is here! The wolfer! Knock on some doors. Mom, you heard how the voice rumbles? Won't there be spirits? It's useless to knock. But there's no one? They're gone. The earthquake, earthquake! But then this village is all ours! I can get in where I want! Of course! We have twenty... thirty,... fourty, fifty houses! Come, Pasqualino, let's open everything! - I want to see if I can find a treasure! Now I catch you! Come on! The one over there is more beautiful. Look how big that one! Come on! Wait, I want to see what's under there! You're both gone mad. Mamma mia, they went crazy! Citizens! Listen to the words I say. Don't get discouraged, life is beautiful. And I promise you that in a few days these streets will be full of flowers and joy for all. Because... Because... Well, now go back quietly in your houses. Open wide the doors and the windows, and wait with confidence the return of the sun. You believe in what he said? - Why not? Mom, you've become cheerful! Play with us. Oh! A flower is there, already! If only there were some wine here! What a pity, in here! Finally! A feather bed! And it's all ours! I like you, Ricuccio! Mom, where are you? You see that you too like to play? Mom, why don't we play always? Ring-a-ring o' roses, A pocket full of posies,... Wooh! I am a wolf! Wooh! We might sleep here, after all. Just as long as there's no earthquake! We should put the wheels to these houses, and bring them along where we want. There should be a stable here. We can put in it the wagon. - This is the most beautiful of all! There are very large rooms, as those of Don Pietro! We're coming! No, don't unhitch. I have to go to Vischio. Well, in two hours I'll be back. Come mom, come Ricu' ! There is also a fireplace. We can light the fire! If you gotta go, you'd better go. Soon it is night. So, I'm going, huh? Wait for me, though. Don't you do like last time. Bye! But really, I'm not free to go where I like? And who says anything? - I know you well by now, y'know? When you're silent it means that you're mad at me. And Ricuccio? He's feeding the cubs. Luckily he takes care of it. If it were up to you! You feel like doing a page of T's, before sleeping? - No, I'm sleepy. Then, some numbers? - I'm sleepy! Who knows if Ricuccio likes me. Ask him when I'm not there. Come on, let's count three by three. Three... six... Nine... twelve... sixteen... No. Fifteen... - Fifteen... eighteen... twenty-one... twenty-four... twenty-seven... thirty-one... No, thirty. Has Ricuccio come up? Mom, is it true what Ricuccio told me? That animals feel pain like people, when their children are taken away. So that's why the she-wolf is always following us. Listen,... nobody taught me how to live. Nobody told me what I should do. And I've always done my own thing. However, sometimes, it would take a guide in life. Come on, work and don't chat! May we come in? - And who are you? We are wolfers. We killed a wolf. Will you give us something? - We cooked everything, there is nothing left. Shut up you! It's my second husband. Come in, come in. Stay and eat with us. On New Year's Eve, whoever knocks on my door is welcome. For sixty years, always so. - All one family? But of course! This is my first son. I've bet to live longer than him. All grandchildren! Twenty are present, and thirteen are scattered around the world. Australia, America, Belgium, France... This is another one of my nephews. And woe betide you if you stop, huh! And even these turkeys, I've bred them myself. Greetings! - Greetings! Greetings to all, happy new year! Cheers! Happy new year! Teresa! Where are you? They're dragees of Sulmona. Take them, they bring good luck. - Thank you. You dance? No. - But why not? We never see a new face, we dance always among ourselves. - No! So then, I will dance! - Bravo, grandma! See how it spins! Look at how many sparks it sends out! How beautiful! It is the first New Years Eve that I spend without him. I should not say this,.. and yet I feel almost tranquil. It was good for you staying around all this time without much thought. No, I thought about it. But what should I do? Life sets you upright again! And so it must be! Today there is snow and in a month... Goodbye, it's spring. With each passing day, one feels different. But I feel ashamed when I think thus. Yes, but you can do nothing about it. Can it be that by a misfortune is born a good thing? I don't know. I would not say it, but me... maybe it saved me. If I think of all the stupid things I've done... I want to cry. Look at those fools. I'd love to see you one day with a white blouse. Mom! Mom! The wolf cubs ran away. Never mind, better that way. On the wagon it seemed so much stuff... Of course, a woman would make it last much longer. I'd collect everything and would go to seek work in the plain. Together with you. Now that you've got the stuff you want to go? But we didn't donate it for nothing. Till there are wolves you must hunt. Rather than start over, I hitch the wagon and house to house, I'll bring back all you gave me. It's that you've lost your head. And you, do what you want, even if you wear mourning. But leave alone Ricuccio! I, when I loved a man, I married him. I've not thought of anything else. Why don't you marry him? Marry him! Against your father, your brother... against the town! It's better that it happened. So it was all made clear. I love you. Leave me. And you too love me. No, not true. - Yes, it's true. Bianca can give you all that I have not. She loves you, you saw it. If you want, she'll marry you. Thanks for the advice. Come on, you gotta go now. Another liter, it's still early. And I close all the same! Anyway, not even a dog is out tonight. Hurry, at home they're waiting for you. - No one is waiting for me! But for me, yes! Come on, don't make a fuss, go! Look how low he fell! I go away if you carry me on shoulders. Will you carry me on shoulders? - I'll lock you inside, mind you! Well then, I'll carry you. On we go! Stop it! - I said I'll carry you! What's going on? Wolves! Right now, out there! Over there! - No, no, they went by there! Go, bring the dog home. Hurry! Nazareno, wait! Did you see where they are? - You go there, I'll go by here. But careful where you shoot, there's people. Come on, hurry up! Pasqualino! Shoot in the air! Otherwise you'll kill the animals! Nazareno! Over there I saw your dog! Luckily they're not ours. You, call the shepherds. I go in front of the stables. Pasqualino! Hurry up, come on! Quick, quick! Send them in! Keep it lit, so they won't approach! Ricu', there's a wolf in the woodshed! We closed it, he can't get out. But there's no time to lose. And who goes in there, now? Poor Tommy! I recall him when I was little. Once he even saved my sheep. - He knew no fear! He was too old! - Oh, yeah! This time, he didn't make it. Poor Tommy! It's in there! There lies the wolf! He thought to find the animals. It takes guts to enter. Give me a sack and a rope. But what you want to do? I want to take him alive. Here, take. Don't do anything crazy! At least take the rifle. Wants to take him alive. Goes in with no rifle! But can he make it by himself? - My God, he's gone crazy! He got him! He got him! Ricuccio got him! Hey! Says he's made it! Mom! He got him! Let's go see! Step aside! Let me through, let me through! Bravo! Now you are really a wolfer! Now nobody can say anything! Bravo Ricuccio! I too have touched the sack! Are you hurt Ricu'? I was sure you'd make it. If you knew how I waited for you! Wait, Ricu'! Let her go! She's not for you. Us two, we're good together. She's an outsider! You too are leaving. Yes. I came to say hello. It's many days since we've seen. - Right. What happened to you? I did as you advised me. Bianca and I we'll run away We'll meet in an hour at the broken bridge. I can't believe that winter is over. We arrived on the same day, and on the same day we leave. What will you do? What I've always done. By now it's not difficult to find a job in my town. Soon there will be the grain harvest. I wonder what I'll do... Now that there's Bianca, I have to wise up. They say they are doing the vine in Monticelli. If you go there, they may hire you. Well, maybe we'll meet again. Me with a lot of children, maybe. Vagabonds like me, you come across anywhere and everywhere. Goodbye. - Ricu', won't you say goodbye to Pasqualino? No, he's playing, and then, it's better that I go like this, without seeing him. Bianca! What're you doing? - You've stolen many times yourself. The money is mine too! I know what you wanna do! Better so! You're in love with that scoundrel! Who cares about love! I just want to flee from this house and this town! I too have the right to live! You won't move from here! Our stuff will not go to that beggar! What's going on? Nothing, nothing... A trifle! But now it's over. Come, dad. Nothing is over! I can't bear it here! But what do you say? Yes, I go with Ricuccio. I run away with him! You thought that I'd wait to be sold at the market? I did as I like! Nothing doing, I'm not afraid of anyone! Even if you kill me, what is done is done! Where is he? Where is he waiting? See you, Tere'. - Bye, Teresa. - And good luck. - Be well. Cheers, Teresa. - Hello. Dad! Wait! What do you want to do? Have you gone mad? No, no! Open to me! Open to me, I want out! Forget about him, dad. You only care for money. About honor, you don't care at all! Hold still! You thought to get away with it, huh? And now you'll pay for! Ricuccio! Ricuccio..! - And you, what do you want? Think about what you do. Indeed, he has wronged you, but is ready to redress. - And how? Let them marry. Never! Bianca is my daughter, and he was born in the stables. He's of another race. - And because of that you want to kill him? What will you get, 30 years in jail? Never mind! You see? To them, I am less than a beast. Tell the truth. Say that you love Bianca. That's not true. I did it just out of interest. - You hear? Don't listen to him. He talks like that out of pride. You love Bianca. No, Teresa. It's time to tell the truth. And if they want to kill me, let them do. You're even brave? After taking advantage of a poor girl. You had already ruined her life! You kept her like a servant. She chose someone she likes! What's wrong? You talk about honor, but like him, you care only about money. If Ricuccio had 1,000 sheep, you'd pass over it all. Let them marry. If you accept him into the house, I'll go away! So go! He's not bad, Don Pietro. He will work! I'm sure of it. These months we have endured together hunger and cold. By now I know him well. Bianca will be happy with him, I tell you myself, as a woman. Walk! But remember that I won't let you live a lord's life! Don't fool yourself! Teresa! Pasqualino! Wait for me! I'm of another race, Don Pietro! Of another race! No, it doesn't suit us, Dad! - Let me, let me! The End
