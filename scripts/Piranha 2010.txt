Aah... Yeah! You wanna job? I pay cash money. Don't bullshit me Jake. My guide didn't show and I need somebody ASAP so... somebody I can rely on... Somebody with... Ambition, Someone who's willing to take chances... ... If you know what I mean. Mister! You talk funny. Yeah, well you're short. Hold on. This is Derrick! Don't you disappoint me motherfucker... I'd... I told you... I want the biggest god damn boat this poe den town got to offer. Hold on... Who is that?! Derrick? He's the director. Oh! So you're like a ... an actress or what?

Especially not Jake. Please... - especially not Jake... I'm serious. No! We don't need one now! - Get out, out, out! Out... Mom! C'mon... Please! We have to talk about this... Mom... Jake, you know I do not have a backup. Yeah I know mom. Yeah don't worry. I know how crazy this week is for you. And... I'll take care of the nitwits, okay. Remember, if you do not fulfill your responsiblity... I have the power to arrest and... and imprison you. Mom, I'm not 12 okay. playing the sheriff card isn't gonna work anymore. No? - No. Like I said, I'll take care of it okay? Alright. Better. Get outta here. Alright... Well next year I'll try to find another solution. Alright. - Alright! Okay. Oh! And Jake? Oh mom! C'mon on! Really! It's time for dinner. Alright, alright... I'll be right there. I hope I didn't wake the kids. Oh god! They'll sleep thru anything. So Maggie said that yesterday was last time she saw them? Yeah, just before noon. She said Matt took the boat out to catch some bass. She drove around the lake all night looking for him. Where's the boat? - Over there. You feeling like a skinnydip? Yeah, I think we can make it to the end of the pier. Meaning what? I'm too old or I'm too heavy? I think you're too chickenshit. By the way, Gordon called last night. Yeah? He said the USGS recorded a heavy seismic activity beneath the lake. Really? They're sending in a team of seismologist divers. Alright! And he said you will escort them out. Jesus Christ. Just been invaded by 20,000 kids... makes us a little busy at the moment. You know. That's what I told them. This doesn't sound too good. So what time is the divers... gonna get here? He said about 10. Shit. C'mon just a little more. Can't get it. Give me your hand! You think a propeller could have done it? I doubt it. Look at the bones, nothing's broken. It's like something acidic... or toxic decomposition. Well if the body's been in the water for weeks. What would you say if I was thinking about closing the lake? You know, just until we get an autopsy report. The autopsy report is gonna take a couple of days. It'll be easier to drain this lake then to close it. It's a big financial week for our town. Too old for this. We're not lying to mom. Yeah! We're not lying to mom. Come on guys... every year it's the same thing. I'm stuck here with you guys while... I miss all spring break fun. You mean spring break boobies? What if I give you guys the cash for babysitting? Sixty dollars and you got a deal. Sixty! I'm only getting paid forty! Twenty dollars deception surcharge. Do not pickup the phone. Do not answer the door. And do not leave the house. Okay? I'm counting on you guys. Alright? Hi! After the dive. Our presence is requested at the Kokamo's. By the Arizona State Cheerleading team. Hi! I'm Sherffi Forester. Bob Gordon asked me to take you out to the site. Very good to meet you. I love the welcoming committee around here.

Alright. So you don't see many women working law enforcement out here in cowboy country. You see a lot of cowboys though. Yeah, Sure. Kelly! Jake! Who exactly are you babysitting here?

So you caught zero fish and you lose our only boat. This sea is so full of accomplishment! Jake is gonna kill us. Somebody will see us. Look! There's some boats just right over there! Don't waste your time, they'll never see us. They're way too far. Hello! Hello! We need some help! Hey! We're over here! Somebody please help us! Look at the size of that! What is it? A... a cavern system? Looks to me like a subterranean lake. Probably bigger then the one above. You see that gap right there? - Yeah? Quake open that one up. Now it's a connecting passage. A lake under a lake. Sorry! It's still your jurisdiction. That's right. It's part of an old volcanic ridge all over this area. That's the beauty of it. We're gonna be the first ones to explore it. You got it. I don't know why you get excited over that crap. All I ever see is rocks and sand. You should probably warn them that it's not pretty down there. Tourists treat this lake like it's a gabbage can. How you guys doing? Sheriff said that it's a regular treasure trove down there. So...! I got debs on these spent bubbles, bad body sprays and back issues of drugs. I got debs on home appliances. I got debs on missing college girls. Oh my god. This is the longest one I've ever seen. Can you keep your mind on the task at hand. It's at least 100 feet Novak! Almost full visibility. Descending fissure! My PO2 is set at 1. 1.3. You should see this. It's unbelievable. Novak, do you copy? Yeah! Pretty good. Okay guys you are about 90 feet to the entrance of the connecting passage. Looks like single file time! I'll go first. No! I should do the prelim scout. Your fat ass will get us stuck. Baby! I'm like an eel. I'm electric eel. I get into such tight spaces. It's shocking. Huh! That's weird? Here they are... but they're spiltting up. Guys? Everything alright? I'm losing you a little bit here. I'm heading a serious drop in temperature here. It's at least 30 degrees colder. You're probably at the mountain near the water lake. Do you have any visual? I'm entering the cave. Jesus! This thing seems endless. You gotta see this. This is incredible. Sam! What are you seeing down there? Something bit me! Oh yeah, right! I thought you always love that kinda stuff. Sam! Sam! Sam! Answer me! SAM! Sam! Something's happening. What? You mean aftershock? - I don't know... Give me my flippers. OH MY GOD! Your body is a temple. And now it is time to give thanks to the gods. Andrew, roll camera! Kelly, you're up! C'mon! Me! No! no, no... No, thanks. I think very had to drink too much. Please! You don't want to worship this beautiful altar?! - C'mon... I know you're partial to the champagne, but believe us you can trust Crystal right? Hey! C'mon Derrick, she... she said no. No... She said no thanks... There's a difference... She understands gratitude is the right attitude. Kelly! Trust us! It... It's never cheating if it's with another chick! Yeah! C'mon try it! - C'mon. Sure! Have fun! Yeah! Jake! You're not gonna take away the fun now? Like I said... she's not my girlfriend. Fine! I'll do it. Okay! - Yeah! Okay! Here we go! First, you lick this salt. Here we go! - Okay! C'mon over here! Then you suck up the tequila. Here we go! Sorry about that Crystal! Here's your vitamin C! Gonna get your lime! Kelly! You don't have to do this. I really don't think I need any of your babysitting here. Jake! Rachel! Okay. Okay. Yeah!... Alright! alright... Let's switch places! Good job Kelly! Jake you're up! Derrick excuse me! Up a little bit. How bout we try Jake and Kelly? What? - What? No! I don't think she. - No! I don't think... Oh! C'mon Derrick. C'mon guys, we'll shooting... porno not a drama. Let's make a decision. C'mon. Fuck it! Sandrat... Let's roll, c'mon! There you go! Thank you Crystal! C'mon Kelly. Come on up here. Come on by the bed! There we go! Let's get you some salt! A little bit of tequila! Okay! Yeah! And... You're live! Okay! okay! Roll, roll, roll... Roll! Sandrat! Sandrat!... Mr. Goodman? Mr. Goodman! I'm coming! I'm coming, hold your horses! The store is closed! I want to know what the hell this thing is doing in my lake! Where did you get this? Oh! In the middle of the lake. Where they're two people dead! Oh my... Oh my! Yeah! That's right... Oh my, oh my. Excuse me! But! Is that a fucking Piranha? Carl! Not the only one. Yeah! here, here, here, look at these... There are thousands of them. Thousands! And they're pissed. You know I have heard of these happening. It's like those alligators in New Jersey, Someone leaves them and then they breed! What? - No...! Who release this fish into the lake... What are you talking about? THIS! Particular piranha, Vanished! Off the face of the earth! More than two million years ago! Emm... Where's he going? Allow me... to introduce... The "Pygocentrus Nattereri" The regional Piranha! They used to swim the entire Colorado river. Right until the Piscusus epic . I still don't understand how you found one. Alive! We discovered a subterreanean lake through a rift, caused by the quake. - But! How could it survived for so long, cut out from the surface? Cannibalism. They must have fought each other to survive. Look! All those scars, on her scales. Notice! The eyes. Jesus. Like he's staring back at you. No, no, no! Not staring... sensing! God! Don't do that! Piranhas hunt in packs. Not for protection! But overwhelming force. They're organized, methodical... The first bite draws blood, more blood draws the pack! So how are we going to stop them? Wait. I'm sorry, you're not actually consider going back out onto the lake? They are killing machines but they're still fish. You can catch them or kill them! If there really are thousands... Ya? Yesterday would have been a good time to start. Oh Shit! It's my little brother and sister! Are they waving for help? I don't know. They are supposed to be at home right now. I'm supposed to be home right now! Jake, jake, jake. What are you doing?! You're gonna miss my money shot! Okay. It's my family! Alright! They could be in trouble! You are gonna be the one in trouble, if I don't get my flying catars right now! What the hell's wrong with you man? What's wrong with me? Oh, God dammit! You're missing it. You're missing it... You're missing the shot! No, no, no... Wow! You missed it! What is wrong with you? Listen! They are stranded out there okay! They might need my help. Boobies, boobies... Alright! Listen to me.

What are you talking about? The piranhas that killed those divers... the ones you're hurting for... They are not fully developed. They're the babies! Babies? huh... So? Where are the parents?
