The year was 2000 and this time there was an accountant from gujrat, jesh patel and a youngster from mumbai, robin. They both think that their dreams can only come true only be by going abroad. The third was rajnam vankateshvaram from tamil nadu. He was trying to end his days of poverty by earning abroad. The only son of calcutta's professor probheer chatterji took away all his retirement money. And now he has to earn for his daughters' wedding. So on his friend's invitation, he proceeded abroad to teach. Delhi's vishal saxena. Like thousands of other young men of the country, doesn't want to do anything living here but is ready to do anything abroad. Haryana's makhan singh also joined them thinking that is the chief's sons can go and earn abroad, why can't he? And an uncle and nephew from u.p., banwari and prem, who like everyone else see solutions of their problems abroad. Ardaman from punjab had the same thinking, just like rajhastan's deepuji rathore who couldn't find his future among the crags and even he saw his dream heaven across the seven seas. Punjab's gurtej. Educated but unemployed. Like others, he too put everything at risk and proceeded abroad. Jammu's aman sahidev was weird. He wanted not to gain by going abroad, but lose. Himself and his memories. And the third passenger from punjab was santok singh. He needed money for treatment of his son's funnel chest disease. That is why he is also ready to go abroad. By any route. At any price. Hey santok! What happened? What is after you? - The plane! - The plane is after him? - I can't see it. - I for india. Airplane! Airplane! Come on guddu, hurry up. How can you just take away the kid from school? 'J' forjahaz (airplane). Hey guddu! Airplane! What happened? What happened? Don'tjust laugh. Tell me something. I am asking you what the matter is. - I got the visa. - What? I got the visa. I got the visa! - He got the visa. He will go abroad. - Yes, he will. - Brother got the visa. - Yes, yes. Now we will arrange a grand wedding ceremony for you. Right, father? Panjiri. It is good for the mind and health. Eat it yourself in england. Don't offer it to others. I will eat it alone after going to england, mother. Never leave your uncle's hand, son. No matter what happens. - You two are our only hope. - Son, take care of yourself. Bhayya, why are you being so sad? Once we get to england, we will pay off all debts. The house and lands, everything will be free. Stop! Stop! Now our dreams will come true too tomorrow you people will arrive in russia. And there pakistan's rasheed bhai will meet you. He will further explain everything to you. Just two days stay there and then to england. Mr. Makhan singh, the plane has left us and gone. You leave it too. Just look at these girls! - We don't have such beauty in my village. - Get a hold on yourself, village people. Come on, come on. Get in. - You are rasheed, right? - No. I am clinton. Who else would have come to receive you? Now get in the bus. These three are from pakistan. They will live with you. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Everything is alright? - Yes. Come on in, friends. This is your home. Light the fire when you feel cold. And here is a three storey bed for sleeping the bathroom is right across. Don't relieve yourselves elsewhere. This is the room heater. The kitchen is right there. Eat whatever you can cook. The journey ahead for uk will start after five days. Hey! Why after five days? We were told two days in delhi. You want to go back? Is there anyone else who wants to go with him? - Not me. - Shut up. - After five days! - Yes. Five days. - What he say? - After five days. Five days! Have you lost your mind? If you get caught everyone of you will go to jail. We are not free right now either! We have been dying of hunger in that room of yours for five months! And hunger can compel a person to commit murder too, mr. Rasheed. Don't gawk at me like this! Those people are in even worse condition than me. And they can do anything! What happened, brother? Gurtej? He is not back with food! He will come! He will come! Shut up, nadari! Everyone here is miserable and you are talking like animals! If you utter one more word, i will beat you up! Quiet, old man! I wonder where gurtej is. He went to get food. Oh brother, i am afraid he might have got in trouble. If so, he will be picked up by the police and lead them here. How much more will we deal with? The police? The agents? Who? This is empty too. Now there is nothing to eat at all. You desi! You should be ashamed! There is nothing to eat here and you are hiding you panjiri! Aman bhai, talk some sense into him. What is there to talk about? I will not give any of it. I promised my mother i will only eat it when i get to england. Okay. Do one thing. Put your panjiri in a glass box and send it to the museum. And label it saying this is the panjiri for which we all died of hunger. Nothing will happen, boy. He will take care of everything. That is all hearsay, mr. Santok singh. The one above will remain uninterested and days will continue to pass by. The doctor gave you one year time for your child's operation. - Six months have already passed. - Six more will pass. Hey prem. What are you saying? Think twice before you speak. You were right, santok. Nothing can happen without his will. If it is night right now, there will indeed be a morning tomorrow. We are half dead waiting for the morning, dada. God knows when it will be. Mr. Santok singh, please forgive us. Prem is a child. He did not mean to hurt you. But this is the truth of all of us. We were confident that in five or six months we will earn enough to pay of all debts. - Correct, man. Totally correct. If i had known we would end up like this, why would i have quit my business of motor parts in mumbai? Had i given regular extortion money to the police and mafia there at least i would not have been in this tension. Shame on us, man. Why did i listen to my parents and come abroad? For this? All this? - That too without a fault. - There is a fault! The fault is going to uk through various other countries. Gurtej? He has come! What is this, man? How long do we have to stay here? Why don't you just shoot and end us once and for all? - One minute. - We spent five months here like this. And back in our country our children and ageing parents are depending on us. - And we are here in this condition! - Right! Have mercy! We have given you our life's entire earnings and this is what we get? Just listen to me! Nobody is listening to me! I am not enjoying myself either having you people here! I am paying everyday expenses out of my own pocket! You are paying to keep us hungry? When have i kept you hungry? You have been feeding for five months. This one time the food got late and you start shouting! And this place you live in, doesn't this require expenses? So don't keep us here. Get us out. That's what was planned. But our luck ran out. The checking got strict that is why we had to detain you here for so long. But it is nothing to be sad about. We leave tomorrow morning. You have said the same thing three time before. But this time it is final. Listen everyone, tonight is the last night here. This is what i came to announce but all of you just attacked me. - Professor bannerji chatterji. - Probheer chatterji. Nice name. You just make them look presentable first. They should look like educated tourists. There is nothing to be afraid of. You all have ten days visa remaining. You can go anywhere. Eat whatever you like. Enjoy yourselves. Compensate for the last five months. Dada, tell me one thing. Dada, you don't seem so old to be called dada by an old geyser like banwari. Oh, this dada is not that kind of dada. In our area, elder brother is called dada. Then elder sisters must be called dadi. That is why mr. Makhan singh calls you desi. Enough, enough! Will you undress and dive in it now? God! What a creature! He is going to england all the way from pakistan just to exorcise! And look at his attire. He looks more like a parrot than a human in green clothes. - Have some shame. - He will die of hunger if he does that. We all have to die someday, baba. Die of shame! This is how the cow looks when you play a flute before her. You were given money for what? To buy drinks? For five months, we couldn't even breathe without permission. Today i want to live freely like these white men. You are right, chaudhry. Today i will be free too. You drank my wine! So buy another one. You will always remain a desi. I don't have any money for more. - Skinny won! - And he will get a handsome amount too. Hey skinny! Just wait. Your dad is coming! Dada, you take care of the panjiri. Aman? Go from here. Come on, fight with me. Come on! Aman. What happened, darling? What? Any problem? - There is a problem. - What? There are some of our indians... that problem is nothing darling, but one of our great problems has been solved. That is why we have to leave for rostok in the evening. Come, lets celebrate it together. That is fine but these indians... let me... but remember we have to leave today, okay? Come fast. By the way madam, do you know you look stunning in this shalwar kameez? Bye. Love you. Love you aman. You stupid man! What are you doing here? Go sit. Nawab khan, didn't you listen? It's a long trip. Go and sit. What sit? You have been sitting us down for the last five months! You charged me airfare and use a truck! I swear donkeys in my village can run faster than this! Sardarji, just look at its condition! At least it is better than ours. - He is right. - I am worried too. Why, rasheed, this truck can go straight to england? Yes, your highness. Somebody do something about this guy. He wasn't even fit to leave his village and they sent him straight to moscow! Brother, we are going to ukraine's capital kiev, not england. - Key? - Yeah, key. The key to england. Is there some kind of door outside england for which there is a key? Oh just keep quiet. - But they key... - just shut up. You talk so much! I was looking at our future. Somebody put a leash on him! - Have we reached england? - Yes. Prince charles has come to receive us. Look. This is our rasheed chaudhry, not who you said. Who else did you want? Come on, get down. Lets see how england looks like. England looks like this? How can it be? Oh shut up! Everybody listen up. You have to enter the jungle on foot from here. And you have to cross the border and enter ukraine before morning. - On foot? Yes. It will be cold ahead. So wear as much clothing you can right now. - Right now? - Yes, right now. Because the route ahead is so bad you can't carry your luggage. I take responsibility of your luggage. I'll see you ahead. Listen. You have five minutes. Hurry up. He has made us don so many clothes as if we are going to the moon. Hey, you people don't know the onion's story? - What onion, man? - Onion! Poor thing was like garlic clove. It too went to england once just like us. Rasheed peeled it so much that it finally became an onion. Does your uncle have a bungalow in the jungle? Yes he does. But not here. In assam. Move, move, move. It's just a little water. This old man can make it, why can't you? Come on, move. I can't walk anymore. - I am tired. - What? Move. Dada, this stupid cannot understand what you are saying. You just keep a hand on my shoulder and walk. This jungle and it's fog! What is a man supposed to do? Don't panic. The fog will lift soon. So many people have gone to england but no one told me it would be this hard. Snake! Dada! Dada! Dada, sit over there. Be careful. Dada, are you alright? If i could walk this much, why would have been my visa rejected on health basis? Don't worry, dada. Just rest. We will continue after that no, no more. I can die but i cannot walk anymore. Dada, not like this! Prem! What happened to prem? Prem! Son! What happened? Stop! Stop! Stop! Prem! Nothing will happen to you! Nothing will happen to you! - Stop! - Pull him towards you slowly. Be careful! Move! Let me see what happened to the child! Rasheed bhai do something! Rasheed bhai get a doctor! Prem! Son! Rasheed! You killed him! You swine! - Shoot! - I gave him an easy death. Otherwise he would have died in agony. There is no city or doctor for miles. - Banwari, he is right. - Of course. Does anyone kill any innocent like this? I couldn't bear the child's pain so i killed him. - I have been robbed! - Banwari! - No, banwari. - I am destroyed! Prem! Prem! My son! I was supposed to go first! Why did he go? How will i face his mother? What will i tell my brother? We had set off to earn money but ended up losing everything! Did i bring him up just to see this damn day? Prem! We have entered ukraine. Come on. Be strong. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Make it fast. Hurry up. No one can stop the departing. Have courage, banwari. By the way, banwari, don't you think we needlessly praise the english? - Such superb land but full of grass! - Totally correct, mr. Santok. If it was in our hands, it would have been glistering with gold like our punjab. You are right, gurtej. Our punjab is beyond words. If someone sees the fire, all of you will get caught. There has been man check. Five people like you have been arrested. Two of them are ours. Now we will have to change our route ahead. Tomorrow morning we will go back to russia from where everyone will be transported to malta in a streamer. And after that all of you would be sent to england in a big ship. Come on. Just a little distance remains. - It is so cold. - Helicopter! A helicopter is approaching! Lie down! Hide in the snow! They will shoot you on sight! Get in the snow! Cover yourself with it! Get up. Hurry up. Everyone. There is nothing there. Where is the helicopter? Where is it? It must have flown away. Come on, get moving. Uncle! Uncle? Uncle? Unfortunate. Very unfortunate. Come on guys. We will have to move anyways. Come. Look there. Go and sit in that truck. From there we will go to the streamer. Consider yourself in malta. You may consider it as england itself. - Big man, who are you? - Me? Bengali. - Bangladeshi. - Oh, dhaka silk! Greetings. O lord, you have gathered so many dreams on this one ship. Now show us our destination too. Boss, look. Look there. Hey! Stop! If you leave like this, what will we do? We all will be killed! - What happened? - Look over there. If you jump like this, you will die. Take something with you. Stop! Listen to me. Take something to keep you afloat. Listen! If there is anything inside, bring it up. - I don't want to die. Help me. - Nothing will happen. - Are you alright? - I am fine. Excuse me. - Sister? - Hey? Why are you following me? Sister, you are the same woman, right? You? You people? Thank goodness you recognized us. There were two hundred people! - We are all that is left. - And the rest? - The rest... - no one survived. Aman. Dada? Dada! Aman? Aman! I am fine, niharika. - I am fine. - I thought that you too... death is not so easy, niharika. Who knows what else life will show us. But look at his mercy too. We were saved from such a great accident and we found an acquaintance in this strange place too. You people come with me. My house is nearby. Me and my husband... we will do everything we can. Yes! It's amazing. Finally, i made it possible for you. Liquid plutonium! You cannot gauge it's value. Yes. But we are giving you much more than any value you can get. Yeah. But this whole thing goes to russian mafia. I only take a small share of this and the rest goes to them. - Yes, it's ours. - Oh, it's a beautiful diamond! Niharika! Not like this. Smile! Shooting? Come on! - Hey stop! - Aman! Aman! Niharika! Hey! Who are you? Aman, this is liquid plutonium. Get this into the right hands. - My husband works with the wrong guys. - Niharika! You first need a doctor. Doctor! Ambulance! Aman, you were true. - You were innocent. I... - niharika! Niharika! I will have to go, aman. Army, people, even my own father! Everyone considers you a traitor! And you, niharika? What difference does my opinion make, aman? I'm so sorry. I have to go. Niharika? Niharika! Your thinking is correct. What do you know about me that you would have handed over something important like plutonium to m? - You are indian? - Afghani... but i stayed in india for five years for studies. Then how come you are here? After the end of najeeb sarkar, afghanistan was engulfed in civil war. My whole family was destroyed in it. After that, i joined the northern alliance so that i could fight the enemies of my country. Oh my god! We are being followed. These are the same smugglers who together with scientists and mafia want to make a deal for plutonium with the taliban. But why are you trying to get it? So that we can give it to the uno and prove that northern alliance is a responsible force which can control afghanistan. Those people went to the other side. Come on. Hurry up. We have to switch cars because they know. From now on, they will never stop for a girl. Right, desi? The truck is leaving! Santok, stop the truck! Thanks. Task? We are here right now. From here to ukraine, then to czechoslovakia, then to germany, and from germany... - but sir these people... i know they cannot go from here because a lot of people are after them. That is why we need a new route. I have that too. From here to tajikistan. Tajikistan's capital dushanbe. From dushanbe, you will be given visas on your new passports and seen off. Passports and visas so soon? They will be fake. Only to board from dushanbe. As soon as you reach london airport, tear your passports and surrender yourselves. And then apply for political asylum. - What? - Shut up! - But the price for this would be higher. - Higher? Why higher? This way is even more easy for you. Forget what is easy or difficult for me. It is easy for you. That is why the price is higher. You also seem to be from our side. Or you may say we are also from your side. Can there be some discount? - Here. - I don't. I also cannot give any more discount than this. By the way, i don't accept tasks to form relationships. Palwisha, what have you considered? - It will be done, sir. - It'll be done? It'll be done! Then this job will be done too. You are unable to forget her? Carry on. - Missed it. - Here, give it to me. Changed. So, you're ready to go? Tell your friends to do the same. Come on. Take everyone out from there. Hurry! Hurry! Stop here. Right here. Come on! Palwisha, we have to go that way. You and palwisha, give us cover fire over there. I will take the whole group from there. - Come on palwisha. - Lets go. Come on palwisha. Get in. Quick! Gurtej has been shot! Stop! Get back! He is dead. Lets catch them. Come on. May you flourish, son. Come back soon, son. We will be waiting. Now you are our only hope. Mother! Palwisha, keep this. I know it will be safe with you. I know it. The court martial proceedings have found captain aman kumar sahidev of the fifth armored regiment as guilty of leaking military secrets to the enemy. All his allegations on his superiors have been proven baseless. The court of inquiry headed by major general v. K. Cahl of western command therefore decides under army act 17, 18 and 19 that his services are terminated and he is awarded 3 years arrest in prison. Dushanbe. - Thank you. - Yeah. Aman. The past should not be given so much space in the heart that it may reign on your today too. Life and the people around you need you. Dushanbe? - Yeah. - Shall we? We will be expected. One should eat whatever he gets in war and hard times. You have been bearing it for so many days. You haven't learnt yet? Look, food is a necessity and death an accident. Why are you joining them both? Why are you sad? What is it? Everything all right? Palwisha, good thing you came. I can't do baby sitting. Take care of these people. Mr. Santok? What happened? Khan bhai? Dada? What happened? - Where is gurtej? - Aman... mr. Santok, where is gurtej? During yesterday's firing, gurtej... - what? - Yes. Palwisha, i am going to the passport office. You bring these people to kriya. There is danger all around here. Danger? Where isn't danger? It has been five months that we have been hiding like thieves and robbers. I am going to the indian embassy to apologize. I will tell them i made a mistake and they can do anything with me! Brother, i don't want to live such a life where one is not allowed to save a dying friend. I don't want to see dreams which grow in the shadow of death. Where there is no one to lend a shoulder, fire or even water! I am going. I am going! You are speaking because you are alive. You wanted to give your life to save few last breaths of your friend? It would have been better if i hadn't stopped you. All of you listen up. I am doing all this because i have accepted responsibility to get you to england. You are right, sir. But gurtej had been living with us for the last five months. - We are emotionally tied to him. - To hell with your emotions! We have to defend against danger every moment. It is stupidity to even talk about emotions here. Control your emotions. - What are you saying? - He is right. The deal was to get us to england, not to save the dying. Even if you are dying tomorrow, do not expect even water from him! I am sorry sir. I am sorry. There will be no emotional stupidity from now on. Palwisha, where do we have to go? Tell me. Palwisha. They have not eaten since morning. Get them something. Emotions don't reduce by eating. Sister palwisha, what kind of a man is he? Can we trust him? - You'll find them. - But i don't understand. How could these people just disappear with my plutonium and diamonds. - What happen? - It's not easy sir. Sameer is helping them. Sameer... who the hell is sameer? I know him very well, infect we used to work together. But due to some reasons we went on different routes. He went his way and i came my way. But i warn you he is very claver and smart too. He's the person who can even save a sinking ship. But... but chief... what will happen now? Don't worry just relax. Have a drink. First of all we'll locate him down and once he is located, i'll handle the rascal myself. This is nonsense. I don't believe in this my husband would have told me, he doesn't keep any secrets from me. It's all lies. Stop it... stop it... don't touch anything. Come here. Sameer i love you. Hello... hello... listen to me carefully, khalika. Want speak that much loud then what is the need of telephone. Voice will reach pakistan such like that. - I'm coming. - Don't come here. You are going to suffer the fever if you'll come to know my condition. Bring back the money from them. Hello... hello... rashid khan is very fraud agent. Hello... hello... - everything is bad. - What happen? My cousin khalid is going to england with rashid. Then stop him. How can i stop him that phone isn't working. If it works then the voice isn't visible. Swine don't want to listen anything, he thinks that we are pulling the money from the trees and having the cold breezes. England isn't it the chacha-kahiro home. I'm leaving for the prayers. - Dial the dialing code of england, dada. - Yes, i'm dialing it. (dada=brother). Err! Brother how long? Till the time i forget my pain in theirjoy. By the way sameer-ji, have to do experiments sometimes. Those who have to much experiences swallow their pride. Hello... hello. Yes this is porbeel chater-ji. Isn't this professor stephen's from oxford. What? Err! Connected to a uganda phone number. Then i'll have to dial haryana to talk at brodha. What do you say chacha?

Too much time left to fly, bhai-jaan. Right now photographs has been taken for the passport. Thanks sameer paa-ji. (paa-ji=brother). - Next. - Me... me... me. Sorry, santokh singh-ji that isn't well. What happened? It's amazing if you photographed after five minutes. - But why? - Your snap meets the poster print. - Why paa-ji? - Because it'll be 12 o'clock. If it's 12 o'clock then what will happen? Whatever happen it occurs with you not with us. Whatever happen it's occurs with us. It occurs to the same sardars 250 years back. Those who banged nadir shah and ahmed shah abadli with their gorilla warfare. They saved millions of innocent girls from them. Stop... listen the whole story which you have started. Do you hear he name of hari singh nalwa? Do you people heard the name of hari singh nalwa? He was the commander in in-chief of maharaja ranjeet singh's army. He felt the same. He busted the khan's and pathan's through the way of kabul. He always attacked at Enemies escaped due to his terror. sardar's time is on. The splendor of patriotism was be seen at 12 o'clock. The splendor of patriotism was be seen at 12 o'clock. Your kind of idiots make fun out of them. Your kind of idiots. Sorry. Now go for the photograph. Looks innocent first time in the life. Don't say sardar-ji such like that at 12 o'clock. Assault would have been made. - Amala. - Yes, pickles of amala. Go and have it, santok singh-ji is distributing it. One photo please. I love you... you have done a good job palwasha. But i'm sorry you'll have to die because i love money. I'm sorry. Don't shoot, i surrender. Palwasha please forgive me. Sorry commander you'll have to die because you love money. This was our famous general of northern alliance, with his help i was wanted to handover the plutonium to the chief then to the uno. And for the sake of money he also... they know that we are in this area. That's why you are going to be shifted from here. Everyone will be shifted to separate house because if there will be an attack then we can help each other. You have this and you have that. First time i'm seeing it i don't know how to use it. When somebody is coming in front you while shooting then it'll starts automatically. - Do you get it? - No. How can it be this isn't a thing to play, it's a thing to drive. It's empty. Still fresh.

Palwasha, what happen? - We are in afghanistan. - Afghanistan. 'Afghanistan' but how could you know that we are in afghanistan? It's my country. I can feel the terror of its air. Palwasha what is all this? This the same fear which i was saying. This is my northern alliance village. To capture it they did all that. God for how long my land and my people suffers the tears of blood? For how long? Lets go. Lord pay mercy on him because now he isn't only yours love one he's ours too. For how long he'll be fine, khan brother? I'll ask them... palwasha behan, what doctor say. (behan=sister). Doctor said no need to worry, bullet passed from one end to another, thank god. He'll be alright with in two or three days. Okay... okay. Plutonium. What are you saying, that was general masood. Err! I heard a lot about him. Why are you disturbing poor jaiesh?

Yes it's depends upon the mood of time. Err! Sameer-ji now you are looking perfectly fine. Yes and looking at very fine changes. Where they are heading, palwasha? Nothing important, the village near by has been attacked. They are leaving for counter attack. But children and old are among them. Children and old all of them are equal for the country. And we are the one who left their own country. Your this song awakes my sleeping valor, deepu. Our country, our home and the voices of children. Ears are looking for those voices. I feel that my village is behind that mountain. Yes, that's the truth. And there mother shout to call me, 'o'makhan'. Come back to home. I wish that i can fly back to home. Yes why not, go back and hear the same from which we escaped. Early morning bell rang at the door and the creditor talk his rubbish that noises of vehicles. Should we go back and listen all this again? No... not at all. We escaped from the poor and miserable life and it's impossible to go back and live there. You are absolutely right bhai. Now sameer-bhai is healthy. Visa has stamped on passport. Now will have to reach dushambay and go directly to england from there. Real life is out there bhai. Isn't it? We are seeing the outer world from past six months, bhai. And we come to this condition and which we haven't seen its may be a little bit better. Or may be too much good. But i only know one thing bhai-ji that the peace of our land can't be found anywhere else. That's why, wouldn't you see the people who migrated abroad they come back every year in search of love and peace and at the time of leaving they cry a lot. If we stayed at our country then we cry every year. There they live in bungalows that's why they like there village streets for few days. For few days. The love to see the pictures of misery. - Understand. - You think wrong. Not for the picture of misery. They come back again and again to feel their land and emotions. And they cry on the way back just because of that they have to go faraway from their own. I can say that because i have passed through these kind of circumstances so many times. Palwasha is right. And the question of building big bungalows is possible because they work 20 hours in a day. Just think among you, is anybody work hard 5 hours in your country? We didn't get a chance. Chance is made by the hard work. And you all want to have everything without hard working. We are doing effort to go abroad. Wrong, this effort and go abroad is wrong. I'm not saying this to go abroad is wrong. But to go abroad with an illegal way is wrong. Go abroad by seeing others success and walk on their foot prints is wrong. Lord gifted every human with some craftsmanship and ability. If we can recognize it then success can be achieved anywhere. No need to go elsewhere. Sameer-bhai says the total truth. What else,,, due to ill fate we are wondering here and their and whatever is going to happen has happened. Now we have to go back home. What do you say? Good bye all of you. I don't want to go back. Go back with empty hands i'll see my child... santok-ji... i worked 16 hours daily on my fields, sameer-saab. I can't save the money for the treatment of my child. All of these things are words to say. Nothing will happen. Santok-ji. Your experience is different but all of them situation are not like you. And the question of your son treatment, i think this is enough to fulfill your all needs. Necessity isn't only with me sameer-ji. All of them have their necessities. And everybody necessities are big at there place. One minute, if all of them needs will be fulfilled then? I thought i'll use them for the cause of my group. But today i feel, the biggest cause is to help humanity. It's too much. We get the success. Now there is no objection to go back, isn't it? Now we'll have to go back. - Amazing. - That's great. They wouldn't share the same fate which has happened with so many, dada. Due to bad luck it has happened with you. - What happen sameer-ji? - I just remember dada's words. We'll go back then none of us have to pay the credit of our land. Means you'll come with us. Why not, i also have to pay the credit of my land. Winners. - What? - Quite. Everybody knows about you. Desi, we win and we are going back, now offer us panjiri. (panjiri=sweet) - Panjiri. - Yes. I'll eat the pinjiri when i get back to home. Starts from qundas and bypassing the jalalaabad, we'll cross the toorkhum border. - Aman - you were right sir. Those who have too much experiences they swallow the pride. Do you come here to tell me this? No sir: When you also decide to go back home along with them then my responsibility is over here for them. Means you aren't going back to your country. Reason? Sir these people decisions are concerned with there needs, wishes and dreams. And my motive is to break every relation with my past. That's why it's not possible for me to leave. Goodbye. Aman. Such like that your past will call you and you'll turn back and look towards it. The past has passed whatever it was. Reality is this the aman who is standing in front of me made by the same past. Separate him from the present is like stubbornness to cut the water with sword. I also tried it a bit. But today i'm heading back. Aman my present will be your tomorrow. That's why understand my present right now. I'm sorry sir. Life isn't the thing to understand with effort. It taught me what it wants to teach me. Will teach me what it wants to teach me. Give me blessing, good bye. Goodbye sir. Why aman left without call? How many times i told you that if he meet you people then your emotions wouldn't allow him to leave. But why it was necessary to leave? I understand. Sameer-ji, how can somebody burry his live emotions for his past. Why we came from that way? Danger is all over here. What are you talking? If we travel with some country visa then all of the diamonds has seized on the airport and we'll go to jail. That's why we all decided that route with consideration. Forget everything by seeing the gun. Paa-ji is calling you, desi. Yes bhai. You acted like donkey. Not like that, santok-ji. He's our man. He's the source of information. Jeep has busted on right location. The area of the drug-mafia starts from here. They have there own jurisdiction here. Whatever be the government is, king, russia, mujahidden or the current government they only earn from them. They transport the drugs from here to pakistan, india, nepal, europe and america and earn billions and trillions of money. They are very dangerous people they can do anything to protect there land. Do you understand? Now start pushing. What are you looking at chaurdrio, i'll have the pinjiri at home with the hands of my mother. Sir, shall we go, we have to go faraway. I'll never forget his smiley face. - Everything is alright. - Lets go from here. Move, hurry up. If somebody will come then we have no other way. Move hurry up... move. Lets go. Grab the hands of each other. Run. Go back. Run. Be careful. We don't do anything, bhai. Bring the rocket-launcher. - Oh god. - Nothing will happen to you. - Oh god. - You'll fine. You can't do such like that. Everybody have to die one day, everybody turn will come. What are you doing pick him up. - Lets pick him up. - No sameer-ji. Already ran a lot now wouldn't run away from the death. Have a heart santok, look i bring the vehicle. - Santok-ji. - Medical box has been found... ...you just keep your strength. - Lets go. - I'm not worried about my self, aman. - Yes santok-ji. My son... - goodbye. - Santok-ji. I come back after getting the news of desi's accident... ...and when i reached here then santok-ji. Why only santok-ji? with their wishes and dreams... ...all of them had been dispersed. Left one by one. May be someone will live among us tomorrow or may be not... or may one will live... he'll fulfill each and everybody's dream. If we'll promise this deed to each other then if death will come it'll be in peace. We have to pledge this. Nobody will die among you. All of you will go back to your home. This is my promise. This is rawalpindi after crossing the toorkhum border. We'll move towards the sialkot from rawalpindi. And from there we'll cross the chowinda to india. But first we'll have to teach a lesson to those agents in pindi. Who are going to send your kind of group tomorrow evening. We have to stop them. Move fast... we have to go to border. Isn't it that much easy to let you free for the border? - Now what do you say? - My brother is very sick, taliba. Taliba he's in very bad condition. (taliba=taliban). My brother will die. Look his condition. They don't have beard and mustache, looks towards their unlucky faces. What's the matter, taliban? What's the matter? Commander messaged, 'some people are trying to cross the border and we have to stop them'. - Our brother is dying. - Quite... quite. Permit us to leave. You people have a mouth or a radio which doesn't stops. He'll die and their isn't any treatment in kabul. What is this matter? They are asking to permit them for pakistan. If they create much problem then put them behind the bars. - Officer? - What's the matter? Sir. All of them are with me and we all are on a secret mission. You may proceed. You people get down hurry up and come to rawalpindi with any vehicle, i'll you people their. Major-saab, commander messenger come with the message that the people to whom you have to arrest you leave them from here. They will be more secure along with you. Gullu, don't act like waheed murad all the time go and bring the bus, children has arrived. - Okay. - rafique-bhaiya... ...give me something to eat, guests are arrived. The whole bunch of balochies... the way to england is not here go in to the office. - Khalid come here. - Yes. That man will spoil the life of the boys, janab. First you'll have to take care of your life, okay. Trust my words, janab. Move from here. Sameer-ji, i'm having the juice. Police took them. Okay, we already inform the military. Military, they also call the military, bhai. Why sameer-bahi doesn't till now? You all will die in the jail and this girl... tell me where are the diamonds. I'll save all of you. - Swear to god we don't know. - Don't know. - At least tell me where is sameer? - We don't know about him bhai-ji. This is nothing what you are seeing in front of military. They don't have anything, hanif-mian. You information wasn't correct. Yes i made them crazy. There is a man name sameer he took each and everything. Check with your source. Sameer-bhai escapes from here with all the stuff and we'll spend our whole life here. I inform the intelligence to take them from here. Who is in charge over here? Who is in-charge over here? He is sir. Sir you come very soon. Should i come late. No sir i didn't mean this. Where are they? Sir they are behind the bars. Sir this weapons has been found. Put it in. Unlawful activities in an alien country, why? - Sameer. - Quite. You'll be beaten here and your voice will be audible in delhi. - Along with you... - shut your mouth. Bring them out. Get out everybody and make a queue. - Lets go... go... go. - Hands up. Don't move. Nobody move otherwise we'll shoot him. Come on everyone, who is he... that who was taking these foreigners by disguising as a solider. - Come forward. - Who is he? They seems to be original. Wow! Police can't do anything of army then you became a soldier. Now see what we'll do with you. - Habib. - I can't believe this. Sir. Sir, enough. - Is he fake? - In reality he's the original one. Colonel sameer ahmed khan. Medal of honor. You may proceed sir. - Sir... sir... sir. - Enough. - That's enough. - Sir enough. Enough. We thought that were hindustani. You are pakistani. Pakistani, hindustani doesn't makes any difference. - You people. - We are alive till now. Son of a fraud. Smash him - sir... sir these gangsters. - And you? I'm rahseed and they are hindustani. I'm pakistani. 'Paksitani', do you know the meaning of pakistani? The meaning of its soil. If you understand then you haven't brutally murdered the dreams of these innocents. You are claiming to be a pakistani. This isn't anything, here is your history. Because of it you'll stay in the jail through the life. Lets go. Listen, you people also move. Your money will be return next time don't try to go abroad unlawfully. Okay. - Jamal. - Sir. Take them to the police station and have there statements. - Yes sir. - Move. You don't worry sir, i'll personally supervise that case. You have this and when you'll get my signal within half an hour you'll have to cross them the border. Habib, thank you isn't enough for the help you made for me out of the way. Why are you disgracing me sir? I don't do anything sir which you have done for them. By the way are your criminals. Whatever we have done for you, isn't enough. You have done a lot for the country, sir. This will be considered as treachery with the country. Yes, this will be considered as treachery with the country. Because my wife is tajik? Sir, i cannot commit treachery with my country. And the soviet union is collapsing. You didn't even tell this. And you got three of your fellow officers arrested! Sir! My country is my faith! It is my mother! This is your past credibility that you were spared the court martial. - But you will be under house arrest. - Sir? Till the time our investigations are not over. And no more discussions about it. I was put under house arrest and a team was sent to investigate. They found nothing. But what i had... the doctors could not save my wife and child. The investigation team proved me innocent. The army apologized and asked me to resume services. But... my whole world was destroyed. Now everything appears to be a cheat. And after that day, life became purposeless. And then i changed in my voyage with you and life started surfacing again. Mr. Sameer... i am sorry sir, in afghanistan you said we would cross over chawanda. Is that from the north or the south? - Did you find them? - No. Not here. How long will you run? News will surface about your whereabouts. No, no. You come with the rest of the group to the north. You don't know sameer. That's it. - I think the border is over there. - Mr. Sameer, we... are in chawanda's north, right? - What happened? - He is a traitor! You are from here and you don't know where we are. He is a bengali and he knows where we are! He has provided all information that has been leaked so far. He just told them where we are. But he was always with us. How did he inform them? I am giving it. Here. Through this. Oh my god! But who was he trying to inform? No, i will tell you. Smugglers for whom i worked earlier. - But you are a bengali. - But this is what i did. Due to my negligence, their large consignment was seized. And i had to run for my life from them. All arrangement for my stay in london had been done. That is why i proceeded like you. But upon coming here i realized that these diamonds could get me back my position if they made their way to them. You said the pigeons would fly in half an hour. Don't shoot. This is the border area. I have the indication. Lets move from here. Give me the diamond. Give me the diamond. Or else i will shoot. I will shoot you. Shoot. Look, these all are indians. You are a pakistani and so am i. We both can distribute the diamonds equally. Whatever issue it is, whether sports or politics, you give it the wrong color. It is about right and wrong. And they are right and you are wrong. Give me the diamonds or i will shoot you! Anyone who tries to pick arms or run will be shot! Don't move! Don't move! I say surrender! Surrender! Stay where you are or you will be shot! Don't shoot! Stop it! Nobody will fire! I am major habibullah. It's an order! I say nobody shoots. Hold it! - Everything is okay? - Yes sir. You are right, but don't bring pak-india relationship in between this. This is the criminal's nexus which is playing with innocent lives. It is because of these people that we got to these people. That is why you should let them go back to their country for the sake of humanity. Well, colonel sameer ahmed khan, they will be sent to their country. But you will be punished. And the punishment is that you will stay here and rejoin the army and serve your country. Long live pakistan! You see that wall of trees over there? India's border lies just beyond it. Our india starts! You can go there easily because of pakistan's military. But will there be any problem on that side? I have been in the indian military. It's time to use the experience. Don't worry. I know the when, where and how. It was the love for their country which made them realize that dreams never come true without your loved ones. This movie is dedicated to all those unknown travellers who lost their lives by getting into these paths. All members of the caravan upon return did exactly what they had promised each other. Palwisha, you were correct. Sometimes life really looks so beautiful. Not sometimes. Now it is forever!
