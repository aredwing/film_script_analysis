'Have you seen Billu Hair Salon there?' 'I'm grateful if you've seen it. It earns me my livelihood.' 'And I'm writing this letter about the same.' 'The condition of my salon resembles government schemes.' 'The present is miserable and the future is bleak.' 'The only possessions I have are..' '..a broken chair which my children call a swing.' 'Someday it will break and cause my clients a back ache.' 'A useless scissors which doesn't cut anything.' 'A comb which resembles the jaws of the old.' 'A tooth here and a tooth there.' 'I am applying for a loan for new supplies to your office.' 'You're probably thinking, why didn't I personally.' 'I am counting flies sitting on the broken bench outside.' 'I've heard government files are not touched..' '..unless someone puts some weight behind them.' 'And I'm inexperienced in matters of bribery.' 'What if things go wrong?' 'So I am asking in writing.' 'Will you take bribe?' 'If you do accept bribes, then.. ..I'd like you to know that I have no money.' 'If you don't, then call me inside.' 'Your prospective debtor, Billu.' Yes, sir? A nut case is sitting outside. Send him in. Hello, Mr. Pandit. Shall I come in? Welcome. Welcome. Come in. Raja Harishchandra. Mahatma Gandhi. Dharamraj. How can they come? They are all dead. I've come alone. I'm giving you so much respect.. ..because those noble men are no more.. And I have the honour of meeting you. You've asked a government officer directly.. ..whether he will take a bribe. Wonderful! Well done! An idealist like you is worth respecting.. ..but not worth sanctioning a loan to. No, if the sentence regarding the bribe hurt you.. ..I will take it back. Is it a kid's ball that you throw back and forth? Go away, Mr. Mahatma. You will not get the loan. Mr. Pandit, give me something for that revolving chair. You can knock on many doors, but you'll not get a loan. - Thank you. - What for? Never directly ask a government officer.. ..whether he'd take bribe. You've taught me this lesson. - Out! - What? Out! Why are you sitting outside? Is there a power-cut? That's why we've lit an oil-lamp. The power company disconnected the electricity. Ok. Doesn't matter. It's good. Famous people like Mahatma Gandhi and Ambedkar.. ..used to study at night with the help of an oil-lamp. What did they do during the day? They used to go to school. They used to help their parents with the household chores. - Yes, Dad. Abraham Lincoln used to study under street-lights. - Yes. I'll study under street-lights from tomorrow. - Why can't you understand? Gaalu! - Gungi! Hey, where is your mom? She's gone to get cooking-oil! Stupid! How can you say that about your mom? - She has really gone to get cooking-oil. - Yes. She has gone to aunt Meena's, our neighbour. Didn't you get the wheat? The market was closed by the time I left the salon. Tell me the truth. There were no clients at the salon today, isn't it? No, there were. I paid rent for the house. - Happy? - Very happy! - Mom, why don't you give him the other good news? - Which one? - The principal has called you to school. - Why? Because there is good news. Madam principal! Hello. Bindiya told me if the school fees are not paid today.. ..you will ask them to leave school. Outside! The office is outside. Pay the fees outside. Go. I didn't bring the fees. Have you brought your memory with you? Last time you begged me, so I gave you my word. I have kept my word. You didn't pay the fees for this month.. ..so I've asked your children to leave. But how will that help? We'll see. We'll see how it helps. We'll see. If you remove the children from school, then two things may happen. The school fees won't be paid.. ..as I can't arrange so much money.. ..and secondly, the children will lose out on their education. You can stop one of these things from happening. - Which one? - The children's education. What? I swear I've broken every piggy-bank in my house. And I was only able to retrieve one rupee. I set out to sell our goat, but my wife got very angry. Ask the goat to teach your children. Should I send the goat here? You'll teach the goat and then the goat will teach my children. But then you'll ask for the goat's fees. Are you trying to fool me? Who started it? Go away! Get out! Get out! "She's a little dusky and a little crazy." You came to school with an attitude that suggested.. ..you had lots of money. And that you'd definitely pay the fees. Didn't I tell you? I'll arrange something soon. I'm happy. I won't have to listen to your boring lectures.. ..of standing first in class. But I've bought all the school books for you. What if you were removed from school? You'd peep through the class window, listen and learn. They why should we go to school? We can also study at home. Mom won't have a back ache from all those mile-long walks to school. But you have to go to school to give the exams. Don't you want to be someone when you grow up? You keep quiet. Budbuda's here. Get down quickly. Those headed to Aaramnagar, Durgapaur, get in quick. Come fast. Come on. Come on. Why do you have to sit in front of my shop every morning? We are playing Flash. Take today for example. Dharmendra lost to me. He'll give me Rs.10 million. Where will he get it from? Not me. He owes me the money. It all comes to Rs.100 million. You think of millions sitting on the road.. ..but you don't have a single penny in your pocket. At least it gladdens our souls. You earn no money all day, so you get angry. Couldn't you find any other place to play? There's no better place than this. No one comes here. There is no crowd here and no one stops you. We can play peacefully here. Oh, God, this peace brings bad luck for me. Let this oil-lamp illuminate you today. Tomorrow there will be no oil and I can't guarantee it. I'm lighting this last wick. After this, it is up to you. He won't help you. There's such a big obstacle right in front of you. Modern Madan! Ever since Modern Madan's salon has opened.. - ..Billu's salon has got no business. - Yes. These glamorous times. Madan has decked-up his salon like Rakhi Sawant. And yours looks like Nirupa Roy. Every hair that grows in Budbuda is trimmed in that salon. Billu, do something about it. Mad guy! Mind your tongue. I called the next guy. So many clients are sitting here. I don't have time to abuse you. Come on. Look at this. Old rate. New rate. Hair cutting rate has been reduced to Rs.10 from Rs.15? What's this new trick of Billu's? Are these Billu's reduced rates or.. ..what unaccounted mangoes are sold for? Turn-off the engine. Don't waste precious fuel! That's a total of Rs.2000. That's Rs.2475. What's this fool doing here? Call him. Billu! Come here. Mr. Doomchand is calling you. How many times have I told you? It's Daamchand. Can't you understand? What do I do, Master? I didn't name you, so. This evening itself, write 101 times, Daamchand! Daamchand! If you still can't remember it, don't come to work. - Hello. - Hello. Since your hair-cutting salon is in ruin.. ..will you cut wood at my mill? No! No! - I wanted to get a new chair made, so.. - So times have changed? The business is good? No, Master. You need to plan things in life. If I know how much it would cost to make the chair.. ..I would start saving money for it. Don't you want to get the chair made now? You don't have any money? No, I don't. I don't want to get it made now. I just have a rupee now. Then why did you bother me unnecessarily? Why did you get those heavy logs moved? Do you think I'm a fool? Look, it maybe a coincidence. All the businesses that are prospering have taken a loan from me. You didn't, so your business is not doing well. Don't worry. Take cash. Forget the actual amount and keep paying interest. I haven't taken any yet. Why would I do it now? Paying you interest will be harmful to me. - Let it be. - Then why are you still standing here? - Throw him out! - Come on! Come on! Don't do anything to me. I'm leaving. - Leave it here. - Give it to me. Give me the log. Give me the log! Get going! Get going! Not a penny in the pocket and has colourful dreams. ..and has colourful dreams. "From the moment I saw you, I've been going crazy." "Oh, my God, you are so sexy." "Come in my arms. Come on, baby, love me." "Come on! Come on!" "From the moment I saw you, I've been going crazy." "Oh, my God, you are so sexy." "Come in my arms. Come on, baby, love me." "Come on! Come on!" "Keep me in your heart." "Hide me and there should be no exit." "My love is a hit, darling." "What's the worry, darling?" "Take my heart away, darling." "Don't be so stubborn." "My love is a hit, darling." "What's the worry, darling?" "Take my heart away, darling." "Don't be so stubborn." "You are my first desire. You're my last wish." "You are in my heart. All I dream about is you." "You're my first desire. You're my last wish." "You are in my heart. All I dream about is you." "Give me a place in your heart." "You know all the excuses, but love knows no limit." "My love is a hit, darling." "What's the worry, darling?" "Take my heart away, darling." "Don't be so stubborn." "Hey boy!" "Hey boy!" "Hey boy!" "I won't ever let you go." "I know your talks are sweet, but how can I believe you?" "It's such a dilemma. I am afraid." "You may deceive me." "I know your talks a sweet, but how can I believe you?" "It's such a dilemma. I am afraid." "You may deceive me." "Take a risk. Test me." "I said whatever I wanted to say. That's it." "My love is a hit, darling." "What's the worry, darling?" "Take my heart away, darling." "Don't be so stubborn." "From the moment I saw you, I've been going crazy." "Oh, my God, you are so sexy." "Come in my arms. Come on, baby, love me." "Come on! Come on!" "Keep me in your heart." "Hide me and there should be no exit." "My love is a hit, darling." "What's the worry, darling?" "Take my heart away, darling." "Don't be so stubborn." Super-hit, Mr. Sahir! Super-hit! You can quote me. Write the remaining story first. After that think about the film's fate. Jerry, the flow of the film is all right till here. What's after this? What's next? Sir, we've had a glimpse of one brother living on another planet. Then he sets out to look for his twin brother. The actual movie starts from here, Mr. Sahir. And this search should be the soul of our film. Because in real life everyone is looking for something. Name, fame, wealth and prosperity. And some are looking for some moments of peace. You know.. You know, if we can make his quest more interesting.. ..then the film would be fun to watch. Otherwise there's nothing original about the reunion.. ..of two brothers that were separated? The pendant! The idea of introducing a pendant is an original one. Very original! - Very original! - Yes. Since childhood both brothers have.. - ..a small pendant around their necks. - Yes. If one of them touches their pendant.. - ..the other's pendant makes a beep-beep sound. - Yes! - Right? - Yes, sir. - We've used some technology here. - Oh, good. Yes. In the climax, with the help of the beep-beep sound.. ..both find each other. - Beep-beep? - Yes. Will people find it believable? - Of course, they will. - I appreciate your confidence.. ..and also your courage. Sahir. Sahir. So much security? What's this new controversy? There's no controversy. Like every successful person, I must pay a price for being glamorous. After watching my last movie some politicians were irked.. ..and they started targeting me. They said I have ignored their religion.. ..and sided with another religion. So I took a stand. I said, "No, watch the movie.." "then tell me the movie is biased." No one had an answer. A politician told me that politicians are like magicians. While magicians pull things out from empty hats.. ..we create problems where there are none. So I became the scapegoat. The intelligence bureau told me my life could be in danger. That explains the security. And now I'm the only movie star.. ..that has got more men around him than women. Right? Sahir. Sahir. Love you all! Thank you! Thank you, everyone. Thank you! - Sahir. Sahir. - Where will the twin brothers meet? In the village. One is from Mars and the other from the village. That's why the film is titled, "Aasman Ka Farista. Khoon Ka Rishta." Wonderful! Jerry, you've become very commercial. By the way, in which village are you filming? Let's see. I'll start the research in a day or two. - We'll shoot in the village of Budbuda. - What? - Budbuda. - Budbuda. I hear it is a very beautiful village. Check it out. - Bindiya? - Yes. You came to borrow wheat.. You promised to come and didn't show up. I had asked for goat's milk in return. What happened? What do I do? The calf drinks all the milk. Then separate them. If they are separated, they start to bleat loudly. The calf is too young. Wait for a week. I'll deliver the milk. That's what they're like. The husband takes money.. ..and the wife takes eatables. Ride slowly. Not need to go too fast. That's it. Be careful. - Yes. - Be careful. Take it. They're at it again! All the loafers are hanging out here. It's too hot this year. Billu, was the postman looking for me? Nobody ever looks for you. I haven't seen anyone look for you in my life. Why are you laughing? What's so funny? Where do they come from? My poem appeared in Ghazal Sagar. I was supposed to receive a money order. Okay. From where did you get this garland? - Oh, this one.. - Did you get married? Where is the bride? I've left her at the hospital. She's about to delivery. - Gamble away, you fool! - Your move. The government has felicitated me with this garland. Felicitated? Why? The government had organised a programme.. ..for the promotion of bio-fuel. - Shut up! - Fresh flowers! White and fresh flowers. At the poetry recital programme, I recited such a poem.. ..that people started to applaud. It was amazing! Had you been there you would've seen it for yourself. Order tea. I'll recite it for you. Recite your poem at Modern Madan's salon. I'll order tea for you. At least some people will flee and make their way here. Stop! Who should we beat up? Shut up! Look, what's written there? 'At reduced rates. Massage, shave, hair-cut.' I'll get it all done. Come on. Mr. Daamchand, you had a hair-cut the other day. Let them grow. What if he increases the rates by then? I will cut my hair shorter so I don't have to spend anytime soon. Will he cut it properly? Why not? You threw him out of your mill. Think. Your neck is on his chair. He has a pair of scissors. What if he cuts your ears and neck and says it was a mistake? So what? We'll break his hands and legs. What's the use of breaking his hands and legs after he has cut my ears? So let's beat him up before you get a haircut. - You fool! Should I slap you? Come on. - Let's go. Billu! From now on, you'll cut my hair. Look, I've come to give you good business. Master! - My back. - Get him up, Master! Hurry up! Hold him! Be careful. - Be careful. - Come on! Be careful. Be careful. What happened, Billu? He broke one of the legs of my chair. And my master's back too. Let's take him to Tiwari's hospital. Not him. He charges too much money. Take me to some other hospital. The cheapest one. This one's for Rs.8, and that one's for Rs.10. Asparagus, red pepper, broccoli. Do you have any of these? Why are you abusing us? I'm not abusing you. These are the names of vegetables. Looks like I have to order them from the city. There are so many fresh vegetables. Don't you eat these? I'll need them all. Listen, vendors! Over the next 20-25 days, send us all the vegetables.. ..that are available in this market. What will the villagers eat then? Are you throwing a party? Has your wish been fulfilled? Shooting.. There's going to be a film shot here. A film shoot? In our village? Is there a grocery store here? - A film crew has come to the village! Come on! - Come on. Let's go. Is this the biggest store in the village? Yes, sir. It is. We'll require food grains and flour for 400 people daily. This shop of yours is too small. I'll get goods from the neighbouring villages. They'll be happy to give them to you. Nobody here has ever seen a film being shot. Good. - Who's the hero? Hero? - He will explain it to you. He'll tell you everything. - Who's the hero? - 'Sahir Khan.' Sahir. Sahir. Sahir. Sahir. Sahir. Sahir. "Burning up like the sun." "Let them burn. Make them run." "No control in their hands." "Burning fire. He's the man." "Burning up like the sun." "Let them burn. Make them run." "No control in their hands." "Burning fire. He's the man." "I always move forward. This is my style." "I don't want to look behind." "I'm walking the path." "Everyone's watching me." "I'm on the move all the time." "Wherever I go.." "the sky and the earth call out to me." "Come along." "Walk along." "Come along." "Walk along." "Come along." "Sing along come one together, we're rocking the city now." "Come along." "Walk along." "Come along." "Walk along." "Come along." "Sing along come one together, we're rocking the city now." "He's on fire." "He's going to take you higher." "He's a piece of fire." "He's going to take you higher." "He's on fire." "He's on fire." - I love you, Sahir. "He's on fire." "This moment is mine." "When it will come back?" "We don't know." "To steal dreams from invaluable time.." "is what I want to do." "Here we go." - Hey. Sahir, I love you. Love you. "This moment is mine." "When it will come back." "We don't know." "To steal dreams from invaluable time.." "is what I want to do." "Here we go." "Wherever I go.." "the sky and the earth call out to me." "Come along." "Walk along." "Come along." "Walk along." "Come along." "Sing along come one together, we're rocking the city now." "Come along." "Walk along." "Come along." "Walk along." "Come along." "Sing along come one together, we're rocking the city now." "Burning up. Like the sun." "Let them burn. Make them run." "No control. In their hands." "Burning fire. He's the man." "Burning up. Like the sun." "Let them burn. Make them run." "No control. In their hands." "Burning fire. He's the man." "A tale to tell. A desire to go a long way." "A new spirit. Let us go." "There is enthusiasm. There is passion." "The rest is useless. Let us go." "Let's go." "Sahir. Sahir." "Sahir. Sahir." "A tale to tell. A desire to go a long way." "A new spirit. Let us go." "There is enthusiasm. There is passion." "The rest is useless. Let us go." "Wherever I go.." "the sky and the earth call out to me." "Come along." "Walk along." "Come along." "Walk along." "Come along." "Sing along come one together, we're rocking the city now." "Come along." "Walk along." "Come along." "Walk along." "Come along." "Sing along come one together, we're rocking the city now." Sahir. Sahir. - Welcome, sir. - Yes.. This is the police commissioner of this area. - Welcome to Budbuda, sir. - Thank you. We have arranged for your security. - We have left no stone unturned. - I can see that. The police will keep the people out of your way. - I hope there will be no disturbance in your work. - Yes. Thank you for all your help. If you don't mind, could you take a.. - ..photograph with my family? - Yes, sure. Hello, ma'am. - My kids. - Hi, kids. How are you? Come a little.. Please. - Yes. Looks like everyone knows about my programme. I thought we'd film in the village peacefully away from the crowd. But it's the same thing here. Inspector, commissioner, DSP, everyone is all ready with garlands. I am honoured that you came here. - I am honoured. - Who are you? How can I praise myself? Charandas Chaubey, the manager of this guest house. Welcome! Welcome! Take this. Come on. - I have renovated the place for you. - Okay. This sofa was totally ruined. I removed it and brought new ones. - Thank you. I removed the earthen pot and got a bridge. - Bridge? - The cooler. - Oh, fridge. Come in. Come in. - Come in. - Hi, guys. - If you want to wrestle, I have the equipment. - Why would I wrestle?.. Come here. Look at this. This is the bedroom. And the bathroom is on this side. Thank you. Keep quiet, Chaubey. Very good. But Rikku, there is no shower in the bathroom. I had sent a plumber from Mumbai. What happened, Chaubey? - I got it removed by the plumber. - Why? He was fixing it. I told him not to. Animals like bulls, elephants and horses take a bath standing up. You are the king of movies. Sit royally and take a bath. We have a table of teak. - New bucket and tumbler made of brass. - Okay. - Having a bath with a brass tumbler gives your body a glow. - I know. Come on, Chaubey. What did I tell you and what have you done? Rikku, let it be. Mr. Chaubey will get the shower fixed. - He had good intentions. - Look, how intelligent your boss is. Police, military, actors and staff. These people who have come here.. ..we've made special arrangement for their stay. Clean bathing water is being ordered from the city in a tanker. Wonderful! In a tanker? Mr. Chaubey, you've worked hard to make arrangements for my comfort. Thank you very much. I am a bit tired. I want to rest. Please leave. And tell me if you have something for me. Since you've asked, I'll tell you. Give me a small role. Act? Do you act? I act a lot. In Ramlila. - Mother Sita has been sitting in my shade for years. - I see. And the floating stone in Ram's bridge.. - ..when I swim, people applaud. - Of course. In Vikram and the Spirit. The part played by the Spirit.. You've done that role too? Okay, I'll keep you in mind. Please don't forget. - I won't. - Don't forget. Now I'm leaving. But if you need anything.. ..just stick your head out of the window and shout, Charandas! Chaubey will be at your service. - Ready, sir. I'll be ready. - Thank you. Please leave. - Thank you very much. - I'm leaving. Sorry, Mr. Sahir. Extremely sorry. That fool just messed up. Doesn't matter, Rikku. These villagers have a different way of showing love. But it's fun. Jerry, give me the scenes. Let me also act in a scene or two. See you, guys. Why are you sitting outside? Your temperature will rise. - Come in. - I was in there for three days. The fever was expecting the intervention a costly injection. But it realised it won't get anything here and so it went away. I went to meet the principal again. I begged and got a week's extension. This time she's threatened me. This is the last time. Bindiya? Sister Lakshmi, where are you coming from? From the market. We've just brought silk beddings and 1 kg saffron. How is your fever? I wanted it to be chikungunia. But it was just a viral fever. For how long has your shop been closed? Will you come home for a haircut? My hair has grown long. - Where is the hair? - What? He said he'll come. You are too much. When you are sick your tongue does the cutting. Dad! Mom! Dad! Mom! Dad, there's a film shoot in the village. Do you know who the hero is? Your friend, Sahir Khan. Oh, my God! Such a famous person in Budbuda? Yes. - Dad, let's go meet Uncle Sahir right now. I want to get a photograph clicked with him. I want both a photograph and an autograph. - Let's go meet him before anyone does. Come on. - Come on. Wait. Let him feel better first. By then he will go back. Shall we call him to our house? Just look at the condition of our house. First change your clothes and freshen up. No, first tell me when will you take us to Uncle Sahir? When.. when you come back from school. Yes! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Hey! We have such lovely kids. Will you also take me with them? Yes, everyone. Wife, kids, cattle, chickens. Everyone. I hear uncle Sahir bathes in a white bucket, with rose petals in water.. ..and lamps all around. Did you forget the heroines? There are fifteen around him. I saw it on TV. Dad, is it true that Uncle Sahir wears his outfits just once. Who knows? Did you pee? Do the pee-pee and then sleep. Yes. What does he do with his new clothes after wearing them? What we do with the old ones? Use it to clean things. And shoes! There's a big room for shoes. Because.. He must also wear his shoes only once. Dumbo! Really. But dad, what does he do with the new shoes after wearing them? Has them for breakfast! That's enough. Go to sleep quickly. I'll wake you early in the morning at.. ..to memorise the tables. Okay? Have this tonic. - Your fever has subsided. - Yes. I hope we can go to meet him. Bindiya, I won't go to meet Sahir Khan. Why? He's an old acquaintance. Lots of time has passed. He must have met many people, must have seen many things in life. He must have forgotten me by now. I'm not going. Just think. If I go and ask him, 'Do you recognise me?' He'll recognise me, but won't say anything. Looking at our condition, he will understand. If he says he knows a lowly person like me, he'll be embarrassed. If I go to meet him after so many years.. ..he'll say I'm clinging to him. No. Bindiya, I won't be able to tolerate it. You're so egotistical. You have such a big ego. Why did you make false promises to the kids? How can I explain this to the kids? I will avoid the subject till the time the film crew leaves. Poor kids. Their expectations will be shattered. Babu, my friend's father is Sahir Khan's friend. They must be living together in the same room. No, he must be his barber. Maybe he cuts Sahir's hairs. He must be a servant at Sahir's house. They're not friends. They might just know each other. Get some t-shirt. T-shirt with Sahir's photo on it.. Hey, even I look like Sahir Khan. 'Superstar Sahir Khan in Budbuda.' Hey, listen. They've printed our village's name in the papers. It's not just the name, but fortune for us. Yes, everyone will be on a roll. Who had come to see the shooting? Come on, it's time. "Oh, these lovely black eyes." - They think they're Sahir Khan. People from Talegaon. I'm starting the bus. Get in. Come on. - Come on, Dad! Come on! - What happened? - Come on. - What is it? Dad, you had promised to take us to meet uncle Sahir.. - ..when we come back from school. Let's go. - Okay. - Don't go back on your word. - No! Okay, yes. - What day is it today? - Sunday. Oh, my God! Not today. I can't go today. Today is Sunday. There will be a crowd in my shop. - Crowd? - Yes. In your shop? Don't make excuses, Dad. We will not let you go today. We will follow you to the shop. - Come on, get going. Come on. - Just a minute. Where is the film shoot? The whole of India knows that the.. ..Film shoot is happening in our village. Where in our village? River bank, near the lake, on the roof.. ..in the cane fields, on the tree, on the stage, or on the street. Where? Let's search everywhere. No, we can't look everywhere in this heat. We'll get a fever in this heat. I already have. I've got the fever to meet Uncle Sahir. You can say anything. But I have to take you to the doctor. Wait. Stop. I'll do something. - Do this. Wait at home. - No! I'll ask Uncle Sahir. He's rich. We have to ask. It's bad manners if we don't. We can't just go there. - I'll tell him, my kids want to watch the film being shot. - Me too! Yes, my wife and kids want to watch the film being shot. So when should I bring them? He will say, 'Bring them today.' So I'll take you this evening. All right? What kind of food does he eat? He's glowing. He must be consuming milk, almonds, pistachios and cashew nuts. He's a hero, not a wrestler. Fool! His dog eats cashew nuts and almonds every morning. And cream mixed with saffron. Ice-cream in the afternoon. Grains with clarified butter in the evening. And some liquor at night. - Even his dog..? - Yes. Not just Sahir, but his dog is also rich. Yes. The dog lives in such luxury? Why am I not his dog? The time of birth is important if you have to be born as a dog. And you were born at an inauspicious time. You just spread rumours. - In a few days I'll tell you the truth. - How? I will write the lyrics for his film songs. Listen to him! He'll do the lyrics. I just need a chance. One chance! - I am very talented. - Don't fool yourself. I've just written a poem. Listen. "Whenever I watch a film, my heart goes.." "Sahir! Sahir!" - If he hears my poem.. - He'll run away from Budbuda. - Don't laugh! - Get going. But remember, I'll go where no man has gone before. Cut it! Cut it! - Stop here! - Come on, boss. The film shoot has begun. Move! Inspector, we want to watch the film being shot. - This is Mr. Doomchand. - It's Daamchand! - Yes, boss. I want to invite Mr. Sahir for dinner. Nobody can talk to Mr. Sahir. If you want to watch the film shoot.. ..watch it from a distance like the others. Camera! And action! Cut it! - Hurry up! - Move! - Are you carrying a coffin? - Move! My boss has arrived! - Come on. Move! I want to meet Mr. Sahir. Take me to the cheapest hospital. Listen, where are you? The principal is here. What? Oh, my God! She must be here to take the children's fees. Tell her I'm not here. No, I won't lie. If wives lie to save their husbands, it's considered to be a good deed. It's an old adage. Tell her. How are you, Sister? Is Gunja's father home? No. It doesn't matter. We are here to give you some good news. - Now you tell him. - Yes. The school committee has decided.. ..that your kids' school fees up till 12th grade.. ..will be paid from the school fund. Really? It's such a big favour. What favour? We're just doing our duty. Please come in. - But you have to do us a favour. - Yes, tell me. We're poor, but we'll do whatever we can for the kids. Gunja's class teacher has told me everything. I've warned everyone in school not to talk about this. - Mr. Billu is not what he seems to be. - What? I mean, he has attended many parent-teacher meetings in school. When we spoke about the fees, he never mentioned.. ..that he is a friend of such a big superstar. He must to bring his friend for the school's golden jubilee programme. - Okay. - Madam, no! - Just a minute, madam. I can't do that. - You said he was not at home. - No, I.. - No, I was in the backyard. Madam, I am very sorry. I can't invite Mr. Sahir. He and I..I and him.. Are not friends? That's what you wanted to say, right? Didn't I tell you Mr. Billu would say that? Men who praise themselves are empty from within. But a gem doesn't praise himself. A gem! Madam, no! Please take a seat. I'll tell you everything. Get the cot. The cot is broken. One of its legs is loose. Yes, my shops chair's legs are also loose. We're all in a similar state. That's our plight. That's why I had asked you for some time. We don't want a free-lunch. We will pay for their education. Madam said you shouldn't worry about the fees. -Yes. - Yes. Just bring Mr. Sahir.. - I can't bring him. And that's that. Why can't you bring my brother-in-law to school? It's for the welfare of our children. When you take us to meet him, we'll invite him to the school. Don't listen to him. - I promise. We'll surely get Mr. Sahir Khan to school. - No! Yes. Your promise has given us some relief. We will leave now. - Madam, she.. - Bye. - Bye. - Goodbye. Bye. Driver, come here. Our job is done. Why did you promise them? I can't bring him. They are taking our kids back. Think about that. If you can't do it, then I'll go myself. I'll tell him I'm his friend's wife. He has to listen to his sister-in-law. No. No! I'll look into it. I'll look into it. You.. Sister-in-law? Okay, everyone for Budbuda, get down quickly. Get down fast. Quickly. Everyone for Budbuda, quickly get down. Let me just meet him! - There he is! Billu, come here! - Billu! - Billu, don't run! Stop! - Caught you! - I'll pay all of you. - No! No! I'll pay all of you. - You had a magic wand. - I'll pay all of you. You had such a magic wand in your hand and you didn't use it. Magic wand? You are Sahir Khan's friend and your shop is in shambles? Not even fools come here. Oh, so that's what it is. Is this an ordinary matter? - What? - Why don't you flaunt it? - Don't trouble Billu. - I would if there was something to flaunt. How long have you been friends with Sahir Khan? Let me open the shop. Get back. Don't trouble Billu! Billu is like my brother! Taj Mahal is the pride of India. Similarly, you are the pride of Budbuda. Now we respect you more than ever before. No! No! I'm the same person I was before. And I will always remain the same. No! What should I say about this new avatar of yours? I couldn't sleep all night. Ask me why? - Why? Were there too many mosquitoes? - No! Because I was writing. I wrote poems about you all night. Everybody thinks my poems are as good as you are. All right, listen.. "He sharpens his moustache." "Like a sword." "In fear of his moustache.." "Kaurava's army lost." I have garlanded him. "Billu, the Terrible." "My Billu, the Terrible." "Billu, the Terrible." "My Billu, the Terrible." "Billu can't be touched by a thorn or a stone." "Billu, the Terrible." "Billu, the Terrible." "My Billu, the Terrible." "Billu is as sharp as blade." "Like the lather of the soap." "Like a fragrant perfume." "There's no better barber than Billu." "There's no one more famous in the world than him." "There's no better barber than Billu." "There's no one more famous in the world than him." "Billu's scream is like the bell of the cycle." "Bunty's sandal is like a cycle's handle." "Billu's scream is like the bell of the cycle." "Bunty's sandal is like a cycle's handle." "Come on, paddle the cycle." "My Billu, paddle the cycle." "There's no better barber than Billu." "There's no one more famous in the world than him." "There's no better barber than Billu." "There's no one more famous in the world than him." "Billu is my childhood friend." "Billu is as straightforward as a noodle." - "Billu my friend. - My friend." "Billu is my childhood friend." "Billu is as straightforward as a noodle." "Shape the moustache of the whole village." "Get Billu on the cover of Filmfare." "Shape the moustache of the whole village." "Get Billu on the cover of Filmfare." "If you hang lemons on Billu's moustache.." "they will become oranges." "Billu, the Terrible." "Our Billu, the Terrible." "Our Billu!" "Billu is the pride of Budbuda." - "Sometimes he turns left. - Billu." - "Sometimes he turns right. - Billu." - "Sometimes he does a U-turn. - Billu." "There's no better barber than Billu." "There's no one more famous in the world than him." "There's no better barber than Billu." "There's no one more famous in the world than him." Stop this singing! Stop singing praises of a barber! Stop this farce! What are you looking at? Will you call a king by his name? Refer to him as barber, and do it with respect. Billu, the barber. Do you get it? Or should I give you a slap. "He has made his father proud." "Don't just call him a barber." "He has made his father proud." "Don't just call him a barber." "Famous men come to him for a haircut." "Call him Billu, the barber." "Our Billu. Our Billu." "Call him Billu, the barber." "Our Billu. Our Billu." "Call him Billu, the barber." "Our Billu. Our Billu." "Call him Billu, the barber." "Billu!" I'm Sahir Khan. Everywhere people are calling out Sahir's name. It has become a prayer of sorts. Uncle Billu's friend is such a handsome hero. Where did they become friends? - In college. - College? Has Billu been to college? Of course. He teaches maths and science to the children. How did they become friends? My brother-in-law was involved in motorcycle accident. Doctor had to operate. It was such a big accident. My husband had donated a lot of blood to him. They still say, my husband's blood still runs through his body. He had asked my husband to work in films. He wanted to make him a hero. - I refused. - Why? These heroes hold and hug the heroines. I don't like it. And nowadays they also tattoo their names on their arms. I'll chop off both his arms. The husband is a barber and the wife is amazing. They earn so much money in films. My husband didn't join the movies.. ..so my brother-in-law brought the movies here. He did this because of his friendship. - When he comes, do call us. - Me too! The film shoot will last all day. So Uncle Sahir has called us at night. - Really? - Yes. - Duggu, take us with you. - Yes. We would have, but Uncle Sahir doesn't like a crowd. He's going to come to school. You can see him there. Such attitude! Let's go. Dad is coming. Just ignore him, okay? Gunja! Duggu! Gunja! Gunja! Well done! Well done! You turned away from your father. What children I have! You should be punished. Because of you, rumours have spread in the village like a fire. Like lightning. Light travels faster than fire. Like lightning! I've had no peace for even a moment. The principal has called for a meeting. I'll tell her I don't know him. I can't bring Sahir Khan. Okay, I won't talk to you from now on. Dad. If you say that you can't bring Uncle Sahir to school.. ..then we'll never go to school. Let's go. Not just for the school.. ..but it is a matter of pride for the whole village of Budbuda.. ..that Sahir Khan's friend's children study in our school. But Mr. Billu, you've put us in a dilemma. You've not brought any message from Sahir Khan. Is he going to come or not? After 10 or 12 days the film crew will go back. If he is going to come, then we'll have to make a lot of arrangements. What is this? - Mr. Billu? - What? - Did you talk to him? - Yes. I told him. And he refused. He can't come because he's busy in his film shoot. Stop the film shoot for half an hour. Does it make a difference? Will there be an earthquake? - There must be a lunch-break during the film shoot. - No? Yes. He can spare half an hour. He is a famous man. He would be busy. He is your friend. You have a right to force him to come. We've waived off your children's fees. We didn't get any charity. We've had to compensate for it from our fund. Bring Sahir Khan.. ..or your kids will be removed from the school. Keep that in mind. Mr. Dubey, don't get upset. Make sure Sahir Khan makes a appearance. - You get him for us! - You get him for us! Go on! - Just a minute! - I'll pull your beard out if you mess with me. - Just a minute. - Who do you think you are? I'll handle this. Just a minute. - Mr. Billu, tell us. - What? I will try. Do whatever you want. But promise all of us here.. ..that you'll get Sahir Khan for the school programme. That's it. What say? Yes. I'll bring him. I thought you had self-respect. But now I know what kind of self-respect you have. There are so many poor people in the world. Do they all run away from their rich friends? Serve me tea. I'll serve tea. But don't ask why I haven't added milk. Did the goat stop giving milk? The goat is giving milk. But so many people come to inquire.. ..that I have to serve them tea. I get no time. Be straightforward. Tell them Sahir Khan is not going to come here. Then nobody will come here. Our house will be deserted as it was in the past. I'm not going to say that. Remember that. Earlier, people used to ignore us. Now, they can't take their eyes off us. This is the only happiness Lord Ram has given us among all this sorrow. Why should I reject it? People are so jealous of us. I love it. You've lost it! Kids too. The whole village has gone mad. As if you're the only intelligent one. If you were intelligent enough, then you wouldn't be hiding. Go meet Sahir Khan. He won't kill you. I've told you several times that he won't recognise me. Are you an astrologer? Can you read his mind? Couldn't they find any village other than this one for the film shoot? Ever since these film guys have come, everything has gone wrong. As if things were very good earlier. Will he or won't he recognise you? Be scared and do nothing about it. His intentions will become clear, only if you go and meet him. If he doesn't recognise you, then it's fine. If he does, then we'll consider ourselves very lucky.. ..that he's a good friend. Excuse me! I want to call the guest house. Which one? Where Sahir Khan and film crew are lodged? I'll call right away. Yes. - Shubhlakshmi Guest House. - I want to talk to Mr. Sahir. Just a minute. Hello. Is this Mr. Sahir? Mr. Sahir? No, this is Yeshwant his secretary. Who is this? Okay. Please put Mr. Sahir on the line. I want to talk to him. I can't do that without knowing who you are. Who am I? - Billu, the barber. - Who? Billu, the barber. Hair.. Hair-cutting. What do you want? Put him on the line. He knows. Give him the phone. He'll come. I got it. Barber, driver, launderer or cleaner.. ..they all want to talk to him. Mind your own business. Idiot! Rascal! Fool! If you call back to bother us.. ..I have a caller ID, I'll hand you over to the police. Did you get it? God knows where they come from! Everyone calls up here. Idiots! - Okay. - What okay? Are you crazy? You called back in spite of what I said. - Fool! Illiterate! - Yes, you.. - Troubling us all the time. - Yes, I understand. What do you understand? Call here again and I'll send you to prison. - Keep talking. - Keep talking? - What do you mean keep talking? - Yes, keep going. Just hang up! Hang up! Don't you understand? Hang up! - Fool! Illiterate! Idiot! Loafer! - Yes. Stupid! Hang up! - Billu! Billu! - Easy! Easy! - One person at a time. What happened? - One person at a time. - What did he say? What did Sahir Khan say? What did he say? Tell us. When is he coming to meet you? - Billu, tell us. - Quiet! - When is he coming to meet you? - Quiet, rascals! - Tell us. - What did Sahir Khan say? - Billu, tell us. - I said I want to talk to him. Even I want to talk to him. Please tell me. - He said he is having a bath. - Really? And I should call him later. - He is having a bath. - Okay. He said, he'll visit me after he's done. - Today's our lucky day. - If he's bathing.. Sahir Khan's having his bath. If he's bathing, then how did he speak to him? - Hey, listen. - How am I supposed to listen in such a clamour? Dhansukh, the moustache suits you. I don't want it. He doesn't have it. So even I don't want it. - Lift it! - Lift it! Will Billu come and lift it? - Bring it in. - Come on. Come on! Be careful. Look over there. Hello Billu. Bring it in. Come on. - Keep it here. - What's this? Rolling chair. For the first time in his life.. ..Master has bought such an expensive thing. Yes. Would I buy cheap things for Mr. Billu? - Don't tell him it's worth Rs.25000. - For Mr. Billu? I didn't tell you to buy this rolling chair for me. What's the fun in buying things that you ask for? Hey! Get up! Get lost! Billu, you've won a lottery! Master, what do I do with this old chair? Throw it away! Not this chair! Don't touch it! Chair! My chair! Now this is your chair. Yes. Take out the goods quickly. - Show it to him. - Give it to me. Show him what I bought for him. Remove all this crap! Look at this. New gel. New spray. New powder. New after-shave. New razor. And new scissors. And this is an air-dryer. Now inaugurate this new stuff. No! I don't want it. Why are you being so kind to me? What kindness? This is kinship. And cost? What interest will you take for this? Zero! 0% interest. Give me anything as the original amount. I am looking at the eighth wonder! Come home, I'll show you the ninth wonder! Mr. Daam, you are such a miser. What's the catch? What do you want from me? I'm not telling you to move a mountain. Just introduce me to Sahir Khan. I want to invite him to dinner. This is impossible! I can't do this. Impossible! Take away your stuff. This is not possible. - Just listen to me. - No! - Listen to me. - Move! Move! Look, not today or tomorrow or day after. But the after that or whenever you get the time. Listen to me. I.. I'll listen to you later. Let's go. What are you looking at? - Come on. - Let's go. - Get in the jeep. - Sir! - Do good business. - Sir, listen to me. Use the new stuff. Raise the prices. I can't return the money. Sir! I can't repay it! Sir! Why are you shouting? Let him go. Forget it. Your business is good. People are coming to your shop. Manage your work. Forget him. They have come to you. You didn't ask anything from them. You are his friend! People have spread the rumours. You haven't told anybody, have you? Then? Whether this true or a lie. But you are not a liar. And listen.. ..God takes many guises to alleviate the sorrow of his devotees. Just assume that God has come to you in the form of Sahir Khan. No! No! I'm not asking you to take undue advantage. But after a long time, your luck has changed. Get rid of the debt. And first of all repay that rascal. Scoundrel bought a chair for you! Stupid! Idiot! Sooner or later the film crew will leave. Until then your financial problems would be solved. Now if someone asks you. Neither accept it nor deny it. What are you looking outside? Wedding or funeral procession. Get in. Soak the henna. Boss, there are more people at Billu's salon than ours. Many more will come. New stuff and new rolling chair. Everything's new in his shop. I hear Daamchand met Sahir Khan and told him he is Billu's friend. - Chatting with him Sahir found out that Billu is very poor. - Then? Sahir just got emotional. - After all he is his best friend. - Stay still. He told his men and bought stuff worth more than Rs.100000. And he loaded Daamchand's jeep with the stuff and sent it to Billu. That's it then. And I was wondering, how Daamchand could spend so much. I hear he will get an AC in a week. How will that help? He doesn't know cutting, colouring and styling that I do. If he has Sahir Khan behind him, he can employ a dozen men like you. The employees will work and he will rest outside. This doesn't happen. Money makes impossible possible. If he gets it, your Jitender will also leave you. You get lost first! Betrayer! I'm giving you a massage and you're praising the enemy! - Boss! - Get lost! Mom! Mom! Look, what dad has brought for us. Wow! Have you brought something for me or did you forget? "At night if the moon or a star falls.." "then pick it up." "The star would be shining. The moon would be shy." "Install it in your nose-ring." "She's a bit dusky." "She's a bit crazy." "Like the kohl, she is always in my eyes." "I've stolen her from the morning dream." "I always think about her." "Believe it or not." "She makes me dream in my dreams." "She's a fairy. She tells me a fairytale." What happened? Sahir Khan. I had seen him on the swinging. My God! You waste my days and now also the nights. - Listen. - Yes. What? Is it true that morning dreams come true? If that was so then I'd be a millionaire. Every morning I dream of being very rich. Go to sleep. "Oh, my God." "At night if the moon or a star falls.." "then pick it up." "The star would be shining. The moon would be shy." "Install it in your nose-ring." "You are the breeze. I am the earth." "I am wherever you are." "When you fly, why don't you take me with you?" "You are the clouds. I am the earth." "We are so much apart." "Why don't you take me with you and pour?" "He's a bit dusky." "He's a little crazy." "Like the kohl, he is always in my eyes." "I've stolen her from the morning dream." "I always think about her." "Believe it or not." "She makes me dream in my dreams." "Believe it or not." "She's a fairy. She tells me a fairytale." "Oh, my God!" "Don't be so curious. Nothing's mysterious." "It's only love that's moving all around us." "Love is so glorious. Love is so marvellous." "Its gotten so fine since the day it found us." "Love is glorious." "Love is glorious." "If I stay silent." "I should hear you." "If I say something." "It would be about you." "Wherever I go." "You should be with me." "Whether I like it or not." "I should see you everywhere." "You are in my breath." "You are in all my moments." "Sometimes confused. Sometimes clear." "You meet me in my memories." "It's your love, girl!" "You get me rocking-n-reeling." "You're so wonderful a feeling." "In love, I have asked you from God. I've left the world." "I'm so crazy about you. I've forgotten myself." "Oh, my God." Kids? They are adamant. They've almost threatened you. If you don't take them to the shooting this Sunday.. ..they will not eat food. They are your kids. They do what they want to do. I've told you many times, I had called him but I got scolded. Didn't you tell him you are Sahir Khan's friend? People are calling up and saying.. 'This is Sahir Khan's father speaking.' He doesn't receive the call. Nobody is allowed to talk to him. I've earned a little money. Will you spend it all on food? The villagers have given it. Photograph for biryani. Autograph for sweets. And they want hanky for the pastries. As a memento. - Bindiya? - Yes. - Should I ask you something? - Yes. - Give me a thoughtful answer. - Okay. Should we hide somewhere until the film crew leaves the village? What about our cattle and livestock? We will cook them when we get hungry. And how should we live when we come back? Under a veil? I've made promises to everyone. They'll trouble us all our lives. So why did you make those promises? It's so difficult to see him. I've found a solution. At the river bank, Meena told me that the film crew need some villagers. They want to gather people for a fair. You know, Meena had also gone yesterday. She got some money. Moreover she also touched Sahir Khan. Silly! She was washing clothes with one hand. Thank God, he didn't hug her. She wouldn't have bathed all her life. Look, I have shown you the way. Now it is up to you whether to meet him or not. Yes. Yes, sure. Tell Banke as well. Next. - Jumman. - Where will the cattle go? - Address. - Pipar. - Please move ahead. This shooting won't last for too long. - Name? - Billu. - They want more villagers. - Address? Budbuda village. Sahir Khan's here. - Tell Sahir Khan that Billu.. - No, he'll meet you later. We'll allow you to meet him later. I am Charandas Chaubey, the manager of the guest house. Yes, we know. But you can't go in. I've heard that before. - But.. - Sir, you forgot something while going to the shooting. Yes, let him come in please. Yes, come in. Please come. - He called me. Let me in. - The guest house manager. Yes, Mr. Chaubey. What did I forget at the guest house? You forgot me, sir. You forgot me. - You were going to give me a role. - Yes. You totally forgot your promise. I am a good actor. - In Ramlila, in the Ashok forest.. - You were a tree. - Like this. - Big fat tree! You told me. And you were the floating stone in Ram's bridge. And in Vikram and the Spirit, he had done the double-role of the spirit. I remember. Just a minute. Give him the role of the inspector. Please. - Mr. Chaubey, this is the director. - Hello. Chaubey. Hurry up! Nobody will move from his place. Hide your water-bottles. You can open your umbrella to protect from the sun. That's it. Nobody should move. - Will Mr. Sahir come here? - Yes. He will. - Okay. Hurry up. Next! Cut it! Wonderful, Mr. Chaubey! First take was okay. 31/9. Take 1. Start the Ferris wheel. Why are you taking me up? Bring me down. Carrousel owner! - Mr. Chaubey, are you ready? - Absolutely. - Do you remember the dialogues? - Absolutely. Very good. As soon as I say, 'Action'. You should deliver the dialogues. - Okay? - Yes. What are his dialogues? 'Same locket. I recall everything.' 'As soon as you two were born, your mother said..' '..that you are two gifts from God.' 'And she put a locket around each of you.' - Nice. - Very good. - You're looking good. - Mr. Sahir! Clap-in! Sound! Take 1! - Why is he disturbing me? - Chaubey. There is so much noise around. - Chaubey. - And he comes and makes a noise. Chaubey! Just a minute. Jerry, take the shot without the clap. And take a close-up. I'll wait. - Ready. - Yes, ready. - Come on, Chaubey. You can do it. - Ready. - He is ready. - Yes, ready. - Good. - Ready. Sound! Camera! Action! Same locket! - What's the next dialogue?

I recall everything. As soon as you two were born, God said.. ..that mother is a star. - Not God. - I know it. - Mother said that you two are gifts from God. - I'll do it. I'll do it. - He can do it. - Correct. Ready. Ready. - Ready? - Yes. - Action! As soon as you two were born mother put the locket around God's neck. And said that he is a star. Chaubey, how can she put the locket around God's neck? I'll do it. - No! - I'll do it. As soon as they were born, mother said they are two gifts from God. - Two gifts. And around.. - I'll do it. - Ready. - Action! Mother put around the God.. God's mother.. Mother put the locket around God and said.. - How can she put the locket around God's neck? - I'll do it.

Cut it! Hold it! Hold it! I'm getting it. Or else I'll lose it. Ready.. Ready.. Sound! Camera! Action! As soon as your mother was born, the star strangled the locket.. Cut it! Just a minute. I can do it. Just a minute. Yes. Ready. Ready. Somebody fix Mr. Chaubey's moustache. Or else he'll look like the inspector's.. ..twin brother and not the inspector. Yes. Action! As soon as God was born, mother tied them both.. ..and sat at the counter with the locket. Cut it! Action! You were born. And my mother remarried. - After my mother's and my marriage.. - Stupid fool! - I'll give you a last chance. - Ready. If you don't say the correct dialogues.. ..I'll bury you right here. - Ready. - Last chance. - Yes, ready. - Action! Same locket! I recall everything. After the two of you were born, your mother said.. ..that the two of you are the stars sent by God. And then she tied the locket to each of you. Ready! Ready! Yes! A barber, who cuts for a living.. ..can also cut himself out of a sticky situation. What's been happening? He has not brought Sahir Khan. But madam, by now the entire district knows.. ..that Sahir Khan will come to our school. Hundreds and thousands of people will come to see him. If he doesn't come, we will lose face. Look, I have tried my best. Now you do something. Right, Mr. Dubey? Yes, pass on the responsibility. I am the manager of the school. I have to do it. Remember, Damodar Dubey has never accepted defeat. I have influential contacts. I know members of a political party. A MLA's PA is a friend of mine. I'll get things done. I have to. Remember, if Sahir Khan doesn't light the lamp on this Golden jubilee.. ..then you can burn me alive. - Stupid! - Listen! "Everything is all right." "If God is with you, everything is all right." " We've made promises, in front of God,." "And abided with worldly customs." "In spite of that if people don't understand let them go." "If they do, do something good for them." "If the world doesn't understand, let them go to hell." "Let them go to hell." "Let them go to hell." "What all does he think of in his dreams." "He keeps wondering." "Don't look back." "If you start thinking.." "your legs will hurt." "Your legs will hurt." "By staying awake all night, I've nurtured this pain." "Pain is deceitful for the young." "I'm crazy for you." "I'll leave this world for you." "I don't care about the world." "My heart is a rebel." "Let them go to hell." "Let's get away from here." "Beyond the mountains.." "where dawn sinks in." "Everyone says.." "choose a good partner." "The one who makes you understand." "I cried at night and my eyes turned moist." "I am full of praise for you." "Quietly, my darling." "Let's run away, darling." "We'll run away from the world." "The world is bewildered." "Let them go to hell." "Everything is all right." "If God is with you, everything is all right." "We've made promises in front of God,." "And abided with worldly customs." "In spite of that if people don't understand, let them go." "If they do, do something good for them." "If the world doesn't understand, let them go to hell." "Let them go to hell." "Let them go to hell." Yes, thanks, guys. Come here. It's too hot. Sahir! Serve me lunch in the van. I'm hurt! Does it hurt? No, I'm enjoying it. You're too much. I didn't tell you to climb a tree. If you had sent a message to Sahir, your job would have been done. There is turmoil. If there is a stampede, many people will die. Is there no other way to let him know.. ..that you live in this village? - Yes, there is. - What? I could hang myself on a tree opposite the guest house. The following morning when Sahir leaves.. ..he'll certainly inquire. People will say it is Billu. Should I? Did you hear? Sahir Khan is going to meet with orphans tomorrow. There is a special dinner. We missed this opportunity too. We have our dad. There is a limit to everything. Stop the car and turn off the engine immediately. Diesel is too costly. Billu barber. You fool! I can't wait any longer. Ever since I thought of meeting Sahir.. ..I see Sahir Khan everywhere. When will you introduce me to him? Be patient. I will introduce you to him. I had a patient. He died of old age. We prepare special food for Sahir Khan everyday at my house. I see. And everyday, I sell it at a discount. For how long will I waste money? - The filming is only going to last for couple more days. - What? - Yes. - Just a couple of days? He came like a breeze and he will leave like a breeze. - Come with me now. - But I told you.. You've said enough. Now do something. Carry him. Come on, carry him. Carry him and put him in the jeep. Take him to Sahir's shoot. - Grab him! - No! - Come on! - Where are you carrying me? But where are you taking me? Don't start the jeep. Let them put him in. Mr. Daamchand, I still have to give him a shave. - Come on. - Now start. But where are you taking me? I have only shaved half of his moustache. - Shut up! Come on. - Stop! Let me come! Who said that? I don't know him. I have never seen him, nor have I heard of him. Actually, I don't have a friend like him. Cut! Break! Yes, go there. Yes, enough. Go there. Be careful. - Please move back. Move back. - Move! Move! We are from the Gyan Bharati School. We want to meet Sahir Khan. - We've talked to the minister. - Just a minute. - Let's go. - Just a minute. Just a minute. Suresh, come in. Suresh! Come in, Suresh. Yes, let them come. I sincerely pray to God that you become so famous.. ..and do great things.. ..so the world always remembers you. That's it. I've said enough. I'm hungry. Let's eat. Yes, let's eat. Let's eat. Stop. Stop. Move. Move! - Move. - Move aside! Yes. We've come to meet Sahir Khan. - Yes. - Let me also come. Have you taken permission? We can't let you in without permission. Why should a friend have to take permission? - This is Billu. Sahir Khan's friend. Honour him. - Friend? Then meet him at the guest house. The guest house manager told us to meet him at the shoot. You are just wasting our time. - Open this. - I don't know anything. - You can't meet him without permission. - Why not? - Then let's go back. - Wait! Where are you going? How can you leave? Go in and tell him Billu has come. Please sit. Hello. Hello. - We've come from a school named Gyan Bharati. - Yes. The minister told me over the phone. Sit down. Please. I am Principal Gehlot and these are our committee members. - This is Mr. Verma. - Yes. - This is Mr. Tiwari. - Hello. - And this Dubey, the manager. - Mr. Dubey. Mr. Tripathi must have introduced us over the phone. We've been friends even before he became a minister. I told him and Mr. Sahir agreed. - Will you have something hot or cold? - No. - Sure? - Yes. No. It is an honour to meet you. Just like the children, I am also a fan. The children have caused a ruckus because you are coming to the school. Due to your arrival the village seems festive. But the problem is that nobody has seen you up close. Yes, but what can I do? If we allow everyone in while filming,. ..we won't be able to get any work done. Anyway, it is fun to watch movies. Filming is not at all entertaining. You're absolutely right. The minister and I had gone to watch a film being shot.. ..and the one who keep jumping.. What's the name of that actor? Abhay Kumar! He came and sat between the minister and I. I ignored him. He thinks he's a famous man. I have read about you in Filmcity magazine. I've heard that you are very controversial. There is enmity between the two Khans. I just heard about it. Excuse me. What was your name again? - Mr. Dubey. - Yes. Mr. Dubey, you talk as if you know the actors well. The film fraternity is a family. A family. - There is kinship amongst us. - Okay. And just like every family, we love each other.. ..and have our disagreements. But this is very personal. Do you understand personal? So, let it be. But every one of you have a few things in common. Money, arrogance and fame. And you think the world can't exist with you. We've come here to talk about the school. Why should we talk about other things? What? Why would.. - Sir, will you attend the programme? - He will. He will come because the minister has told him to do so. Just assume that he will come. - Dubey! - Yes. Keep this in mind. I don't dance at anyone else's tunes. Filming may seem like a lot of song and dance to you. But it is a job for us. Hard work. The entire unit has come here to work. We're not here to attend functions and parties. Madam principal, please don't misunderstand me. I want to meet your kids. And all my fans. But we are behind schedule. So, it's not possible. - Sir, I apologise. - Oh, no. It's not your fault. It's okay. We can invite some other Khan. Mr. Dubey, you have some misunderstanding about film stars. In real life we are just ordinary people. We like little things. We find joy in little things. We also get angry about little things. So madam principal, before I slap him, please take him away. Come on. Let's go. - Just a minute. Please, come. - What? Please come aside. This isn't fair. You are bullying us! You are bullying us. You are bullying us! - We can come some other time to meet him. - Some other time? - I'll introduce you! - Are we going to Mumbai to meet him? The filming is about to end. We want to meet him here! Yes, that's for sure. - I am sorry. - No, No! It's okay. Thank you, madam principal.. ..for removing him from your class. - What can I do? Some people are like that. - Yes. You get such stupid people everywhere. There is such an uproar outside. They just want one look at you. People don't come to school. In this heat, they crowd around your film shoot. Because one insolent man.. ..don't break so many hearts. Please. Our villagers will get a good look at you. Don't refuse. Okay. I will come but, keep that idiot at a distance. - Okay? - Yes. Okay, I will come for a few minutes on the last day of filming. - The 16th? Is it okay? - Okay. - Yes. Thank you. - Thank you. - I told you. You can't meet Sahir Khan! - Who are you to stop us? - Should I hit him? - Why are you asking me? Hit him! Hey look what's happening. Charge! Well done! Open the gates! Where is Billu? Have you trampled on him? Hey you stupid. Move. One autograph. Autograph. Mr. Sahir. Catch him! Stop him! Let me go! Sahir! Sahir! One autograph please. - Sahir! - Stop him! - Be careful! - Sahir! One autograph, Sahir.... No! You illiterate people, do you have any idea.. ..what a grave crime you have committed? Z-security is given to very, very important people. And your group is trying to get passed them. You'll go to jail for 15 years for attempted murder. We've just gone to meet Mr. Sahir Khan. - Why? - Doomchand wants to make a movie. You went there just like that. Did you take an appointment? We didn't take an appointment. His friend was with us. - Which friend? - Billu! Billu, the barber. Idiots! Think again. How can an ordinary barber introduce you to Sahir Khan? Like smoke and cigarettes go together. Wine and intoxication. Similarly, Billu is Sahir's friend. - Who said so? - The whole of Budbuda says so. And who told the whole of Budbuda. What proof do you have? - Of what? - Of their friendship? What proof do you have? - Daamchand! - What? Did Mr. Sahir go to his shop to meet him? Did he call? Did he write a letter? Did he click a photograph with him? He bluffed and you believed him. You pampered him with song and dance, 'Billu, the Terrible!' Where is your Billu, the Terrible? Rs. 25,000! I bought a new chair worth Rs. 25000 for him. I have incurred a loss because of him. Several scissors. Boxes of Denim powder and perfume. Cream and also mirrors. And small plastic comb. Who will remind me of it? Your dad? From your talks, it looks like he was fooling the whole village. Yes, I've been telling them since the start. Money, land, jewellery and gold. And even eatables. God knows what he took from others. His house was in ruins. And now it looks like a mansion. He had taken Rs. 2000 from me and also from Jhallan. Right, Jhallan? Yes? Yes! Rs. 700! Yes! Yes! He had taken it. Why don't you do this? Why don't you file a complaint against Billu? I'll send him to jail for fraud. Give us the form. We will give our signatures. Hey! Get everything from the shop and put them in the jeep. - Come on. Get it out! - Don't leave anything. - Master! - Should we beat him up? The police will do it. - Ok. - Get up! - Pick it up! Get all the stuff. - Why? - Get the chair. - Don't leave even the comb. - Take this. Sir! What's all this? Rascal! The police started beating us so you ran away? You are Sahir Khan's friend! The scoundrel had the whole village fooled. - Take everything! - Count it! - Don't leave even the soap. - Yes. I've never come across a fraud like you. Did you think you would go scot-free? You're more dangerous than a snake. Dryer! Did you get the dryer? We got that. But he used up two bottles of powder.. ..and four tins of cream. - Write it down. Put it under his name. - Yes. - We'll get something from his house. - Yes. I won't allow you to do conduct business in this area. - Take all the cash you can. - Yes. I'll do it. - I'll deduct it from the interest. - Yes. You'll spend the rest of your life shaving the prisoners in jail. He's a thief! He's a fraud! Sahir Khan doesn't know him. Don't come to his shop. - Let's go! - Come on. - Come on. - What nuisance! Let's go. Uncle.. Billu, the Fraud! Go home and rest. I'll shut your shop and leave the key at your house. Go and rest. Who is Billu, also known as Bilas Pardesi? - Why? What's the matter? - Are you Billu? Not me. This is him. Come to the police station. What have I done, sir? You fraud! You've embezzled people's money. You fooled them and now you want to know what you've done? Come to the police station. I've done nothing, sir. - Don't argue. - The villagers must have been mistaken. Everything will be crystal clear soon enough. You can talk to the DSP. - Mishra, take him. - Yes, sir. - Sir! - Come on! - Sir! Sir, I've.. - Come on. - Sir.. - Come on! Yes, all right. Come on. Get in. Get in! Billu, don't take this very seriously. Don't think about it. The lawyer's fees have been arranged. Just assume that is was something in the past.. ..or some nightmare and forget it. "I search for it with moist eyes." "I don't know where my house is." "Oh, God, tell me." "Why did you punish me like this?" "Breaking all relationships.." "abandoning all these memories.." "with this sorrow.." "where do I go?" "Breaking all relationships.." "abandoning all these memories." "with this sorrow.." "where do I go?" "Oh, Lord." "I had a small house and I was find of happy." "What did you gain by taking it away from me?" "I had a small house and I was kind of happy." "What did you gain by taking it away from me?" "All I have now is my life." "Should I also give up that as well?" "Breaking all relationships.." "abandoning all these memories.." "with this sorrow.." "where do I go?" "Breaking all relationships.." "abandoning all these memories.." "with this sorrow.." "where do I go?" Look, who is there? Sahir Khan's sister-in-law! "abandoning all these memories.." "with this sorrow.." Where are you running to? Show us your disgraced face. Did your brother-in-law come? We didn't see him. He must've come at night. "with this sorrow.." "where do I go?" - Mr. Tiwari? - Yes. - Is the garland, the flowers and the bouquet ready? - Yes. Okay. - Did you test the microphone and the speakers? - Twice. Firecrackers? - I've given them to the peon. - Okay. - And the school band. - They are waiting. Okay. Sahir's secretary said that he'll leave by 5pm. - It means he will be here by 530pm. - Right. Mom, hurry up! That's enough! - That will do. - Wait! Celebrities will come there. Dress up properly. Give me some money. What if I get hungry? Ask your dad for money? If you have some, give it to us. Otherwise, forget it. - Won't you talk to your dad? - No. Come on, Duggu. Everyone has left. Gunja! Mr. Ram Khilawan, please wait for me. Everyone is going to see him. Can I ask you something? Do you really know Sahir Khan? How does that affect our lives whether I know him or not? I've seen a lot of his movies. I wish I could see him in person once. If you permit me.. Go. Wait. It must be crowded. Don't go alone. - Come on. Roll it out! - Yes. Hurry up! Stop the jeep! Turn-off the engine. - Come on, Master. - Yes. - Has Sahir Khan come? - Not yet. - We've come on time. - Yes. - Go tell the school staff what I've thought about. - Yes. Go on. We've inspected the stage. - Is everything ready at the gate? - Let's check. - Hello. My boss, Doom.. Mr. Daamchand has come. So what can I do? He says that if members of the administration request him.. ..he can give a speech about Sahir Khan. That would be a great honour for us. But he has a condition. You have to seat him next to Mr. Sahir Khan. - Why next to him? We'll seat him in his lap. - Wonderful! Get lost! You fool! Move! Move aside! Did they agree? No. What did they say? - Should I tell you? - Out, you fool. They said, 'Tell that rascal to get lost or sit in some corner.' - Did anyone hear it? - No. If anyone in the village finds out, then you're dead. - I've never seen such crowd in Budbuda. - Yes. Mr. Sahir is on his way. And keep water bottles on the stage and.. Hey! Come on. Move ahead! Hey, photographer, as soon as I put a garland around Sahir Khan.. ..take a photograph. Do you get it? I don't want excuses like you felt like sneezing or you were pushed. Got it? Our faces should be very clearly seen. Oh, my God! Look at him. If Mr. Sahir sees him at the gate, he will go back immediately. - Come on. Move ahead! - Move ahead! Madam, don't worry. Please go. I'll handle him. Move! Please! Please move! Mr. Dubey, what are you doing here? Sahir Khan thinks he is a big-shot. He maybe? I'm doing my duty. As soon as he comes, I'll put a garland around him. And my job is done. Mr. Dubey, if you wait here who will give the welcome speech. What? Me? Why are you nodding your head? How can I give a speech? Should I give an impromptu speech? The speech is ready. Just go through it. Read it on stage. This is not an exam. What do I do with this garland? As soon as the speech is over, you can put a garland around him. - Yes. - Come on. Move! Hey, photographer, stay close to stage. Very close. And like I told you. Click the photographs quickly. There's a seat here. Look. - Who wants to sit at the back? I'll sit in front. - Okay. - Come, Mr. Dubey. - I'm memorising the speech. - But when I speak.. - Go in. I don't want any interference. Don't disturb me. Hey, open the door. Hey, baldie. Go away. Get up from here. Get up. Don't you understand? Go away! Hello Mr. Bihari. Yes, don't send him through here. Close this road. - Hey, go back. - There is too much of a crowd here. - What are you doing? Go back. - Hey, go back. Get back. Welcome, sir. Welcome. - Welcome. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Please come. Please come. - Welcome. - Keep it. - The children have done this. - This way please. - All this? - Yes. - This way. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Gullu! Gullu! Hey, don't look at him! Doomchand is calling you. Don't look over there. Beloved Mr. Sahir Khan, important people from Budbuda village.. ..my colleagues and students. Don't be afraid. I'm not going to talk too much. I still don't understand what's happening.. ..whether it's a dream or it's real? None of us would have imagined.. ..that such a famous person would come to a village called Budbuda.. ..and would come face to face with us. Mr. Sahir takes us back to the characters he portrayed.. ..the songs he sang and all those joyous moments. Mr. Sahir is one of great artists of our country. And I don't need to provide any proof. - Please walk fast. - Countless national.. ..and international awards make good witnesses. It is an honour for the Gyan Bharati school committee.. ..to welcome such a prestigious person. Every Indian is proud to take his name. He has rendered our grief and happiness on screen.. ..and has given us a golden reason to live. I request Mr. Sahir Khan, the dream maker.. ..to guide our students and talk to us. Mr. Sahir. Please, sir. Sahir. Sahir. Sahir. Sahir.. Thank you. Thank you very much. Sahir. Sahir. Sahir. Sahir.. Down! Thank you. A big hello to the respected people onstage and everyone else. And lots of love. The film had to be shot in a village. And I just uttered the name of your village. Budbuda. In my childhood, I'd heard that your village is very beautiful. Madam principal is right. I had never thought I would come to you.. ..and become a part of your everyday lives. Actually, it is not necessary.. ..that God thinks about your life the way you think it should be. That's why someone has said that if you want to humour God.. ..then tell him all your future plans. Well, I apologise from the bottom of my heart.. ..that you couldn't see the filming more closely. My last film was a little controversial.. ..which is why the government has provided extra security for me. The security caused you some inconvenience.. ..believe me I'm just as troubled by it. That's why I've left them very far away. All the way there. And have come close to you. I've been told to give some direction to the children here. Direction? It is a big word. Forgive me, madam principal. I can't. It's too hard. But I'd like to say one thing to my little friends. Children, the days of childhood.. ..are the most beautiful and best days of your life. Chunni, sitting over there would say.. ..that she has broken her tooth and it's paining. Or Bunty over here would say.. ..that his teacher had given him a sound beating. Some kids are afraid of exams. Those days are beautiful. The most beautiful days. Yes, children. I want to assure you.. ..these are the most beautiful days. Because Bunty, when you grow up.. ..and you have a beard like this gentleman.. And Chunni, when you become a pilot.. ..and you are worried about flying a plane. Then you would yearn for these days. But you will never get back these days and these moments. Today, you're heart is pure. It is pure. Shining gold! The relationships you form now. The friends you make.. ..you'll never ever make such friends and relationships ever in life. Looking at you, reminded me of my childhood. You have good clothes, good books to read and good food. Maybe you won't believe me.. ..but in my childhood I had none of these things. My childhood was very ordinary and simple. I was not the film star Sahir, but just Sahir. My father was very poor. We had nothing. But in everyone's childhood there is someone.. ..who makes a definite impression on us. He becomes a partner in our mischief and shares our troubles. He's our friend and companion. I had a companion who was just like that. My support. The blessing of my God. Billu. Billu, my friend. I still remember, during our lunch-break.. ..children used to eat from their lunch-boxes. I just used to drink water. It was Billu who used to pat my back and give me his lunch. My friend. My hair was as long as a girls'. But I didn't have money to cut them. It was Billu who cut my hair.. ..when his father was not in his shop. Billu....My friend. When I used to be sad thinking about my mother.. ..he used to steal money from his father and take me to watch movies. He was Billu. My friend. While returning home, he used to get me.. ..to mimic characters from movies.. ..by promising to buy roasted groundnuts for me. Those evening and those lanes.. ..Billu had brought out the actor in me. I didn't have as much faith in myself as Billu had in me. One day he sold his gold earring and bought me a ticket to Mumbai. He kept the rest of his money in my shirt-pocket. I held his hand and told him that I would return the money. He told be that I didn't have to return it. I should help the needy with it.. ..and remember him when I did. That's enough. Then I came to fast-paced Mumbai. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa............ I became Sahir, the film star in no time. I went back to my village to find him, but I couldn't find him. Someone told me that he had fallen in love with a girl.. ..who didn't belong to his caste. The villagers were against them.. ..so they ran away in fear of their lives. They left the village. I would like to tell you the truth. I have everything.. ..name, fame, all because of him. Wherever I go, millions of people flock. They call out my name. The air is filled with cries of my name. But even today amongst those millions of voices.. ..I search for only one voice. The voice of my friend, Billu. You never told me. You sold your earring. The lunch-box episode. But he remembers everything. Yes. I never thought he'd remember all that. I can spend the rest of my life knowing that Sahir still misses me. I don't want anything from him. He has a very big heart. That's why he is where he is. What happened? The programme has come to an end? No. Then why did you come home? We started crying. So we ran away. Forgive us, Dad. We made a big mistake. My darling, come here. Caalu..! Caalu..! I would do the same thing if I were you. I heard everything you said. It was wrong of me to think that you've become a rich man.. ..who would have forgotten everything. I would forget? I searched for you, but I didn't find you. But you could've got my address. Didn't you ever feel like seeing me? When I ran away from the village, I had many problems. No money, new responsibilities, new house and an unknown place. Many years went by before I could set up this house and business. You moved up so fast and I was left thinking about meeting you. You've gone too far ahead. Then I lost hope of meeting you. I'm in a bad condition. I didn't want you to see me in this condition. Let it go. It was the fear in my heart. I was ashamed. You were ashamed? Of me? I thought so. Forgive me. - Bindiya? - Yes. Come here. What are you names? Gunja. And this is Duggu. - Duggu? - My name is Ronak. Very nice. I've come to your house for the first time. Are you not going to serve me? I'll get some halwa (sweets) for you. Billu, I have to go now. But I will come back soon. We'll go to our village together. If it's possible, you should settle down there. So that we can relive our memories. Sahir Khan! - Hello. - This is uncle. The rest are our neighbours. - Hello! - Hello! Hello. Okay, bye-bye. Sir, I'm Jhallan Budbudiya. I've written a poem. I'm Billu's friend. I'll be grateful if you listen to it. "You came close." "You came close. And smiled in such a way." "You showed me countless dreams." "Now I can neither sleep, nor stay away." "What can I do? A lot of things are happening to me at once." It's very good. I'll use it in my next film. Yes, sir. This is my most recent work. "Pappu can't saalaa dance." No, Budbudiya. That's enough. Nobody offers me such songs. But sir, you.. Sahir Khan! Come on! Brother Billu! Billu! Brother Billu! "Billu, the Terrible." "Billu can't be touched by a thorn or a stone." "Billu, the Terrible." "Billu is as sharp as blade." "Like the lather of the soap." "Like a fragrant perfume." "There's no better barber than Billu." "There's no one more famous in the world than him." "There's no better barber than Billu." "There's no one more famous in the world than him." "Everything is all right." "If God is with you, everything is all right." "We've made promises, in front of God,." "And abided with worldly customs." "In spite of that if people don't understand let them go. If they do, do something good for them." "If the world doesn't understand, let them go to hell." "Let them go to hell." "From the moment I saw you, I've been going crazy." "Oh, my God, you are so sexy." "Come in my arms. Come on, baby, love me. Come on! Come on!" "Keep me in your heart." "Hide me and there should be no exit." "My love is a hit, darling. What's the worry, darling?" "Take my heart away, darling. Don't be so stubborn." "My love is a hit, darling. What's the worry, darling?" "Take my heart away, darling. Don't be so stubborn." "Oh, my God." "At night if the moon or a star falls.." "then pick it up." "The star would be shining. The moon would be shy." "Install it in your nose-ring." "You are the breeze. I am the earth." "I am wherever you are." "When you fly, why don't you take me with you?" "Oh, my God." "Oh, my God."
