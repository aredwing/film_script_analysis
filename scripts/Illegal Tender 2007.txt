What happened to our money? It was for my daughter! Joey. That's enough. Bring him out, man. Bring him out here. Go get me Joe. All right. What did I tell you about stealing from us? It's the second time you took our money. (SPEAKING SPANISH) How many fucking times we got to tell you? Yo, what's up, Caesar? Don't look at him! This is the last time you're going to steal from us. (BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH) Oh, you think I'm joking now? (SPEAKING SPANISH) Yo, what's up Wilson? (MEN CLAMORING) Calm down. Listen, you can't shoot this motherfucker in here. You can't. JOEY: You're always saving him! Listen, I'll handle the man, okay? You the boss, Wilson. You the boss, but I'll be standing right here. You cool? I'm good, bro. I'll be right here. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Damn, Joey, you fucked him up real bad, man. He shouldn't steal from us, bro! He shouldn't steal from us. (SHUSHING) Yo, he's a bullshitter! What? Joey, do me a favor. Take the bags outside. Wilson. Take the bags outside. Just give it a good planchado and take the bags outside, okay? You the boss. Okay. You got lucky. Get the bags, man, let's go. I should have shot him dead. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Wilson. You don't know, bro. Sometimes you gotta play the only chips you've got. Gracias, Wilson. Gracias. Wilson, hold on. You got a phone call. This is Wilson. JAVIER. How we doing, Wilson? Javier. Doing well, very well. Yeah, that's what they tell me. But what can I do for you? You've done enough. When are you making the payment? Tonight. Will you be there? Do you want me to be there? I prefer it that way. You know we have something to talk about. Then I'll be there. Divvy this shit up, all right? Hey Mercy, Sonia. $10,000 per stack, not $10,001, okay? No more pennies given away. (POP MUSIC PLAYING) (SINGING POP SONG) Jessenia, get away from the TV! No more. That's it, I can't. Wait, I'll cut you a little piece. No, I feel as big as a truck already, Ma. Well, that's it. I need a bigger piece than that, Ma. (SPEAKS SPANISH) Enjoy. That's what I'm talking about. Exactly what I'm talking about. Millie. Yeah. We're gonna talk about those jeans? Wait. Jeans. What jeans? Calvins. No, those jeans? Let her have them! Those are our jeans. Shut up! (ALL CLAMORING) You have an ass, she doesn't have an ass. I'm gonna get them for you. Sit down. MILLIE: Girls go get them. Sit down. She's giving the jeans away. Sit down. Good flan, I like the flan. Better than the one before. You got a plan? Plans? You gonna live here with the baby? I have something cooking. In my home I did the cooking. My man paid the bills. You been cooking? What I meant was, I have something happening down the line. It's gonna happen. Do the math. She's eight months. It's over. Jessenia, don't be so nosy. NILSA: Get it together. I don't want my daughter living in this neighborhood. I thought we talked about this, already. You're right, they don't fit. Give us a minute, mamita. What happened? Nothing. Just give us a minute. Are you sure that... (SPEAKS SPANISH) Okay. All right. I want you to listen to me. I'm serious. I'll take them. I'll take them both. If my daughter has to step foot in this rat trap neighborhood after giving birth to my grandchild. We understand each other? I gotcha. Good. I love you, Millie. I miss you, baby. He's kicking like crazy. Okay. Good night, honey. Good night, get home safe. Bye, I love you. I love you. (CAR HORN HONKING) I'm stepping out. Be right back, okay, babe? Where are you going? I've got to drop that thing over at Javier's. Look, I want you to see something. Caesar's waiting for me outside... Come here. Just for one second, papi. Okay? Look, it'll be a second. A second is up, sweetie, he's outside waiting. It's Javier, like, I can't be late. I was late last week... Look, I want you to see how much you don't have to go anywhere tonight, okay? What's that? These are checks that I deposited into a legitimate business account. See this? Milson Enterprises, Inc. Who are they? You better not give my money to no one. Who are they? Milson! Millie. Wilson. Milson Enterprises. It's a corporation that we own. So you see, all the money that we invested in Lugo's Bodega and the catering hall all the other ones, I had them pay us back by check. And I deposited it into this account, Milson Enterprises, Inc. So, all the money that you made on the streets is clean, now. So, you see? You don't have to go anywhere tonight. You might have been the smartest girl at Baruch. Well, I was also the smartest at Bronx Science, too. Oh, guess what? What? I'm smarter. Oh, really? How's that? I made you mine, didn't I? Right, Junior? Come on. (SALSA MUSIC PLAYING) Get a hold of Wilson. Okay, in through your nose. In through your nose. Hold it. Hold it. All right, you got it. (SHRIEKING) What's with the gun? Hey, Javier, what's with the gun? Has nothing to do with Javier. Javier, what's with his gun? Javier, I can't talk to this boy! I can't talk to this boy! This is between me and Javier, I can't talk to you, man. Mind your fucking business. Javier, what the fuck is this? What the fuck! Put that thing down. Put the briefcase down! Caesar, shoot this motherfucker. Caesar, shoot this motherfucker! Don't fucking move. Open that briefcase. Open that briefcase. Here's your boy. (BABY CRYING) NILSA: He's so beautiful, Millie. JESSENIA: Oh, he looks just like Wil. Take care of this guy. You two know what this is about? None of our business. You taking orders from Javier now? Yeah. You don't even know what's going on here. You're gonna let me explain, or what? Nothing to explain. This is between me and him, just shut the fuck up! It was wrong, what you did, Wil. You passing judgment on me? This isn't about us. You should have done the right thing, Wil. Look, I have a kid coming. You gonna do me like this? You should have considered your kid, not us. Don't do this. Don't you fucking do, don't fuck... I knew this much was gonna happen. This is the life he wanted, this is what happens. I told him not to go! I told him not to go. Yo, you gotta hear this, you gotta hear this. Joey, what's up? You need to know, Millie. I had nothing to do with what happened to Wilson. He was my compadre. I loved him. Look, I don't want to hear it. But that fucking Caesar. I think he had something to do with it. I'm hearing a lot of shit out there in the street. What are you hearing, Joey? Tell me. You're in danger. You and the baby. But, look, it's gossip, people talk. Look, let him finish! Jessenia, please, can you let him talk? I'm having a conversation, here, okay? You gotta get out of this neighborhood. You gotta go. Okay. Thank you, Joey. You need me for anything, I'm on the block in front of Lugo's. You call me. All right. Anything. Okay. Oh, my son. (BABY CRYING) Don't you worry about anything. I'll protect you. Hey, Joey. Hi, nenas. (RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR RADIO) (CAR ALARMS BEEPS) (RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON EARPHONES) I know who she's going for. I'm not bringing nobody. GIRL: Who are you going for? I don't tell, but I do. 'Cause y'all talk too much. Oh, come on, this is not high school. Ana. You know what I'm saying? Wilson. How was the test? That bad? I couldn't finish it. It was hard as fuck. Statistics is like anything. It's just numbers. To you, maybe. To me it's like hieroglyphics married to codes and symbols. Well, bring it by the house and we'll review it together. What's wrong? Nothing. What's wrong? (RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) MILLIE: Well, that's what she said all the time, the lost art of cooking. Secret is in the sofrito. Wilson? Come here and say hi to a friend of mine. Wilson. (CLICKS TONGUE) (SIGHS) Oh, that's all right, that's all right. Look, maybe we can do this somewhere alone, someday. Yeah. And we will. You want to give me a minute? Sure. Thanks. Wilson, get back here right now. That wasn't necessary. Well, you know something, I just don't remember raising any idiots. Pleasure to meet you, Wilson. Okay, leave. Get out of this room, right now. I'm sorry. It's a phase. Yeah, we all go through phases. Don't worry. Cheers. RANDY: There it is. Yes! Come on! What up, little man? Wil! What up! Oh, okay, Xbox 360. Okay. Come on, come on. Come on. Start all over, start all over. Start a new game. Wait a minute. Go get your homework. See, I like that you just know what to do. Delicioso. Yeah. See you tonight. Where's your homework, Randy? Found it. Exactly. Here. Come here, come here. Eight times eight is what? Sixty-four. Okay, so why did you put fifty-six? I don't know. MILLIE: Wilson? Yeah? Can I talk to you, please? He's checking my homework, Mom. I know that, baby. He'll be right back. Turn that off until you're done with your homework. Mom! Off. (GROANS) These last two right here are wrong. Really? Yeah. Check them. Stop rushing your homework. Son, let me ask you a question. What did I tell you about the garage? You didn't tell me nothing. I told you I wanted it cleaned out. I wanted to put some workout stuff in there. You can hire people to do that. No, Son. I asked you to do it. This ain't even about the garage and you know it. Well, okay, I really don't give a shit what you think it's about. You know what? I just want you to do what I ask you to do. It's that simple. I'm not gonna do it. What's your problem lately? I don't have a problem. It seems like you do. Now, you keep disrespecting me, and you keep doing it over and over, Wilson. And I want to know... By the way, did you have to be rude to Ralph? Who gives a shit about your friend, Ralph? Hey! I do. What's your problem? You know what? Forget it. I said I was gonna help Randy with his homework. Wilson, wait. Listen, you've never questioned my integrity before. And you know what I'm about. If you have something to say to me, Son, then just... Then say it. You know what? What? What? ANA. So what do you know about your father? Nothing to talk about there. I was ten when my grandmother died, and after that my mom shut down, and she went man-crazy. Can't blame her for that. I'm not blaming her for that. You're judging her. I'm not judging her, I'm just saying it's irresponsible, that's all. What are you talking about, Wilson? Forget it. I don't even want to get into it. It's just... Shutting down is not gonna help. I'm not shutting down. I'm not gonna let you get me into this back-and-forth stuff. What back-and-forth stuff? What? What back-and-forth stuff? How we going back and forth? This. I need a break. Look. The last relationship my mom had, Randy was produced, and the man disappeared. And? And I love my brother more than anything on this planet. And she is getting older. She should slow down a bit. She don't need to do this in front of Randy. Do what? You know what I'm talking about. You want her to be alone? She's not gonna be alone, because she has me and Randy. You're being silly. You know what? I don't give a shit anyway. I'm 21 years old. I want to have my own place. I want to move out. I don't want to be in the house no more. Really? Why you smiling? I don't know. You're not ready to live with me. Your father would kill us. And what is with your father, anyway? What are you talking about? Well, it's the way he looks at me. It's like he's ready to kill somebody, like... He's got these eyebrows. They're like werewolves. Don't use my father as an excuse. Anyway... I'm a good woman. Yeah. Yeah. This is true. You don't know what you're missing. Anyway, my daddy's like a teddy bear. Oh, yeah? ANA: You trying to get me on the hood again? MAN: Ana! How you doing, sir? Hi, Daddy. Enjoy the orange. Wilson. Werewolf. Stop. I'm telling you. Goes for the shot. Ice cream? Yep. Randy, I thought I told you to leave the ball in the car. They'll steal it. Nobody's going to steal anything. Stop bouncing this ball. Okay. Okay. All right. Come on. Don't bounce it. Don't bounce... Don't bounce it! He bounces it high! You wanna keep bouncing the ball, huh? RANDY: Keep bouncing it, keep bouncing it. He goes for the shot! But he misses it! He shoots it! He gets the rebound! Another shot! Randy. Come here, sweetie. Sweetheart, stay close to me. You want chicken tonight? RANDY: No. Pizza. No. Chicken. WOMAN: Let me get a pound of salami, please. Randy. Okay. Come here, Randy. Stay close to me. Stay real close, okay, baby? Please, baby. Stop bouncing the ball. I told you. Please! Stop bouncing the ball! Shit. Excuse me. Millie. I thought that was you. It's me, Wanda. From the Bronx. Willis Ave. Wanda, wow. It's been a while. Is he yours? I'm Randy. Oh, how adorable. Oh, but this isn't compay Wilson's, right? Wilson's dead. We gotta go. It's good to see you. I didn't know you were in Connecticut now. You know, you should give me your number. Sure. Give it to me. I'll log it in. Here we go. It's good to see you. Take care. Yeah, you too. Let's go. We didn't get my cereal. We'll get it later, sweetheart, just stand in front of me and watch the cart. ANA: What you know about this, Wil? WILSON: It's an old joint. It's a classic right here. I wanna see you get busy. (REGGAETON PLAYING ON CAR RADIO) How's that doing for you, baby? You see, like that. Come on, you do it. No, you do it better than me. Come on. That's all you right there. You're so cute. I like it when you smile. ANA: So what, did you speak to your math professor? WILSON: Yeah, I spoke to him. What did he say? What he always says. What did he say? ''No exceptions.'' Meanwhile, I got a 4.0. and he gives me attitude. Don't listen to him. What are you doing? Mom says we're moving. What are you talking about? MILLIE: Randy, sweetie, can you come upstairs and get the rest of your toys? Fine. Good, I'm glad you're here. Can you help me with some of this? So, we're not taking any heavy stuff right now. You're kidding me, right? Does it look like it? I'm not going anywhere, Ma. Wilson, no. Uh-uh. I don't have time for this right now. Make time! What did you say? This has become a thing for you now, right? Is that what this is? Every couple of years we move to a new town? What is it, Mom? The dates dry out? There's no more men to fuck around... Hey! Maybe I should go. No, no, no. That's okay. Stay right there. You, come here. You may be 21, but don't you ever dare talk to me like that. I'm not 14 anymore, Mom! I know that, Wilson! Okay? Let's get it through your head! I'm not 14 anymore. I'm not gonna move for some phantom reason that you can never fully explain to me. Okay, listen to me Wilson! Till this day, Son, you've never needed anything, right? Right? Yeah, so? Yeah, so! So right now you need to listen to me! And go get some of your things together. You're absolutely right. Till this day I never needed anything. But you have to give me something, Mom. Because I'm not going anywhere. You're a man already. Fine. Come with me. I'm gonna go. No. Stay. Because we might end up living together sooner than you think. I've been trying to crack that safe since I was 14. I know. Combination's your birthday. Oh, I should have known! Do you wanna know about your father? You wanna know? Or what? Because if you don't, it ends right here. Fine. Let's go back upstairs and do what we have to do. I wanna know. I wanna know. Fine. I've always been straight with you, Wilson, I'm not gonna stop now. Your father, he was a drug dealer, Wilson. Great. So, you're telling me he was a fucking loser. Is that what it is? That loser was my husband. And it's gonna take you about 20 more years to become half the man that he was at your age. Don't you ever talk about your father like that to me again. This is fucking bullshit, Mom. Get the fuck over here! Come here. Hey. MILLIE: This is some serious shit and I need you to step outside of yourself for a minute. And be a man. I am a man. Fine. Then all I'm asking you to do right now, Wilson, is to listen. No heavy lifting, just listen. Like a real man. Come on, you can have that one. Go ahead. I'm listening. Now, your father, he... He got himself into some deep trouble with some people. Are you gonna listen? Go ahead. Three times they came at me. One time when you were just a little baby. And then again when you were Randy's age, and then yet again when you were 14. How come I don't remember any of this? Because I have always done what I'm doing now. You know what? Now you gotta listen to me, Mom. Okay? I'm not leaving everything that I have here. I'm not leaving Ana. I'm not leaving school. Nothing. For some Tony Montana that doesn't exist. Tony Montana shit that doesn't exist, huh? Why don't you feel that? Stop. Do you feel it? Mom. No. Do you feel it? Stop! Stop! Where did you get that? Where did you get the fucking gun, Mom? Mom? What is all that? It's called weight, Son. Mom. Yeah. Listen. I'm taking Randy because I have to protect him. Protect him from what, Mom? Because we've been spotted, Son. That's all you need to know. Been spotted by who? Okay. Okay. Randy and I are leaving. You coming? My God, you're not coming. If you're your father's son, you'll defend yourself. You won't let anything happen to you. Doesn't make sense, Mom. It was 20 years ago, right? Okay. You're good. Mommy says you're not coming. Not right now. You don't love me? We're not partners? We will always be partners. Always. Come here. I love you. I love you, too. Okay, good. Give me some. You're the man. I'll call you later, all right? All right. Be a good boy. Listen to Mommy. You okay, baby? I love you, Mommy. I love you too, baby. I got it. Take care of him? Mmm-hmm. Son. I'm sorry. ANA: Dominos? What? This is real numbers here. Okay. Babe, pizza again? I never said I could cook. That's a lie. This one's different, they put pineapples in it. It's been a few days, babe. Your mom's fine. She'd have been fine here. Whatever. Fine. What are you gonna do? I don't wanna talk about it right now. Okay. Done. You want more? No, I'm good. I'll drink from yours. Oh my God, babe, you just missed it! WILSON: What happened? Who's ahead? What did I miss? Baby, do me a favor. Bring the plates to the kitchen, we're done. Ay, bendito, you miss your mom. Please? Give me a kiss. Baby. I like this. You have candles? Baby, I want you to go downstairs to the basement, I want... (DOORBELL RINGS) And I want you to hide under the stairs. Who's that? What are you talking about? You're scaring me, Wilson. Please. Go now. ANA: Knives? What is it? Be quiet. Go! Go! Come on! WILSON: They're here to kill us. ANA: What's going on? Keep it down, baby. What's going on? Keep it down. How'd they get in so easily? How'd they get in? I thought the door was locked. I left the door unlocked when I got the pizza. Damn, babe. Shit. (GUN FIRING) Why are they shooting at us? We're okay, we're okay. Stay there, okay? Yeah, I'm staying here. But why are they shooting at us? I don't know, babe. They looking for you? No, they're looking for my mom. I think. My birthday, my birthday, come on. Please. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) ANA: Wilson, you need to do something, let's go! Wilson, what are you looking for? WILSON: 1985. What are you looking for? I can't believe this. You got this, Wilson. Shit, you have a gun? You got this. Yeah. Where'd you get the gun from? Mom. Miss DeLeon gave you a gun? Yeah. Oh, shit. Why are they looking for you, Wilson? Babe, relax! Okay? Relax? Someone's shooting at us. What are you doing with a gun? Please, okay? Please. Shit! I think they're coming. What the fuck is going on, babe? Get back under the stairs. Okay, okay. (ANA SCREAMING) Get the gun! WILSON: Stay there, okay? Wait! Where you going? Ana, stay there. Don't move. Please. I don't think you should go. Come on! Put the gun down. Fuck. Come here. I love you. I love you, too. It's all right. MILLIE. How's Ana? WILSON. Fine. Well, as fine as she can be, considering. What's this all about, Mom? Over 20 years ago, right? Mom, why is this beef with you? Because to them I'm just a policy. I know who they are, Wilson. They murdered your father. And while I'm still alive, no one feels safe, as far as they're concerned. ''They''? Well, you know, I say ''they'', but not really. It's... It's one guy. Who? A guy. Who? His name is Javier Cordero. He lives in Puerto Rico. When's the last time you seen him? You know, I don't want to talk about this anymore. You look tired. Mom, there's ways to deal with this kind of thing. No, you need to get to bed. Listen to me. I'm not getting into this with you right now, Wilson. There's Witness Protection Program. Enough, already! Don't you think I've tried that, Wilson? There is no Witness Protection Program for us. We're not very high on their priority list, Wilson. You know how much the government is willing to spend to relocate us and keep us on the DL? You, me and Randy are not worth the expense to them, because they told me all they'll have is a small-time gangster named Cordero. Now, why don't you download that into your brain? We're alone on this one. There will be no help. And the sooner you realize that, the sooner you're gonna help me keep this family alive. ANA: Miss DeLeon, can I ask you something? That depends. On what? On how long you plan to stick around. Hey, I'm here. I love Wilson, Miss DeLeon. I know you do, Ana. That's not what I'm referring to. I know what you're referring to. And if he was someone else, I would have been gone a long time ago. I don't know. I don't know what's going on. And I don't know if I want to know. Ana, what I think you should know is that when you love someone, their journey becomes yours, just as much as theirs. Yeah. Miss DeLeon, no disrespect, but what is it that you wanna know? You're so young. You got your whole life ahead of you. I know. Why do you want to complicate it? Maybe this isn't the right time for you to commit. I don't... I don't have the answer you want. And I don't know how far I'm willing to go with all this. The only thing I'm sure of is that I'm not going anywhere today. Okay. RANDY: Got you! In! Go get it. RANDY: Why can't you get it? Thank you. You know I... Huh? Right here. Can I have the ball, please? Come on. Come on. Come on. Randy, stand behind me. WILSON: What are you trying to say? ANA: No! It's 20 years it's been happening! This is my mom I'm talking about. This isn't about your mother, it's about you! Could you stop? This isn't a good idea, Wilson. It's not. How long am I supposed to let this go on? It's not up to you. It is. It's not... You saw the look in her eyes when she saw that man. Right? We both saw that. Who was he? Doesn't matter. It does matter! It doesn't matter. It's like she saw the Devil himself. What am I supposed to do? I don't know, baby, I don't know. This is the best you could come up with? Listen to me! This is the way, ma. I gotta do this this way. She's not gonna tell me anything, so I gotta go over there and find out. This is the first time in my life I look in my mom's eyes and she don't know what to do. And I've never seen her like that. I gotta do this. Okay? I gotta do this. Who do you think you are? Her son. Hey, taxi? Yeah. Bag? Throw it in. I'm Solomon! Welcome to my cab! How you doing? Talk to you in English 'cause I know you are from New York. Right? SOLOMON: Where we going? WILSON: Isla Verde. Isla Verde. Hey! My name is really Manuel. But people call me Solomon! Okay. Why? 'Cause I got the answers. Any problems in Puerto Rico, you talk to Solomon. Oh. What a beautiful sight, huh? Nothing more beautiful on this island than our women! Tigers are beautiful. And they have teeth, also, like women. Can't be that bad. What did I tell you? I'm Solomon, pueta! Gracias. Bye. Strawberry Icy. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Okay. All right. Enough of the tour. I gotta go see somebody in Ocean Park. Oh, my God! Hey, Aunt Jessie. Oh, my goodness! (SPEAKING SPANISH) I'm good, I'm good. How are you? Ah, you know. You look good. Thank you! Look at you! You're not a little boy anymore, huh? You know. Come in. Oh, my God. Wow! Thank you. You're welcome. So... What are you doing here? Just taking a break from school. Oh, really? Where you staying? This small hotel in Isla Verde. No, you can't stay at a hotel. Look. You can stay here, I have plenty of room. No, no. I don't want to impose. You're not imposing. I know, but that's not why I came here. I just wanted to ask you a few things. Oh, yeah? Like what? About my father. What beef did he have with a man named Javier Cordero? What's the matter? Nothing. Relax. I know he was a drug dealer, and the whole bit. Okay. I'm gonna tell you this one thing. And then I don't want to talk about it any more. Okay. You said that you know that your father was in that business, right? Yeah. I never knew anyone that hung out with the real dogs, like Javier Cordero, that lasted longer than five years. He's not bad news, Wilson. He's the worst news there is. Okay. So whatever happened to Cordero? I don't know. Last I heard, he owned a club in Old San Juan. Mora's. Sweetie, do me a favor? Don't ask anybody that question on this island. What question? As far as our family is concerned, Javier Cordero is dead. Okay? (SPANISH HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Oh, yeah. (PHONE RINGING) Hello. Hey. It's me. Hey, Mom. Are you all right? I'm good, I'm good. Everything okay over there? Yeah, everything's fine. Where are you? I'm at a friend's place till I figure things out. There's nothing to figure out, Son. You got a family. Come home. I will, soon. You sure you're all right? Yeah. Okay. You know, Randy wants to talk to you. Here he is. Hello? Hey. Where are you? I'm nearby. I'm gonna see you soon. My school told mom I'm so smart for my grade. I told you you were smarter than me. Nobody's smarter than you, Wil. I miss you. Come home. I miss you too. Put Mommy on, okay? I love you. I love you too. Bye. Bye. Take care of yourself, son. I will. Wilson. Yeah. I love you, Son. I love you too, Mom. It's you. It's always me. I told you so. Where are we going, sir? Viejo San Juan. (SPEAKS SPANISH) We're good right here. (GREETS IN SPANISH) Hey, hey, kid! Yeah. Remember. Tigers with teeth. (ROARS) Gotcha. (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Come and drink. (CHATTERING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Shit. Wilson DeLeon, Jr. Wilson DeLeon, Jr. I'd ask you to sit down, but as you can see, there's only one chair. Mine. (LAUGHING) Goddamn. How's your mother? Alive. And you come here to find out why I'd like to change that. Right? What do you need from us? I don't need anything from you. She has something that belongs to me. For 20 years? Yes. What is it? What is it? What do you think it is? Money. Money. My mother doesn't have any money. Oh, she has money. My money. Didn't I say that? Maybe you could work something out. You think you can work out two million dollars? Two million dollars? She doesn't have two million dollars. Trust me. You sound just like your father. You're intelligent. I can hear it in your voice. Stupid people, they can quote Socrates anytime they want. It wouldn't matter. They still sound stupid. Listen to me. I came here man to man so me and you can work this thing out together. I want you to leave my mother out of this. You wanna negotiate with me. Not a good idea. I want you to go back and speak with your mother. Better yet. Let her do the talking. One look at you, she'll know where you've been. (GROANING) (MEN SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (MEN SPEAKING SPANISH) (RINGING) WILSON. Hello? Hey. It's me. Why haven't you called? I've called you like, Don't talk so fast. What's wrong? I'm all right, I... What happened, Wilson? I don't know how I got back to my hotel last night, but I'm all right. What do you mean? What happened, babe? When are you coming home? Hmm, that's a good one. Looks like it hurts. All right, let's see if you can handle this. Oh, yeah. That's right. It hurts, right? Okay. So what did I tell you about riding your bike without a helmet? Odds go up 50% of me getting hurt? That's right. No more bike riding for you. Never again in my life? Ever? Just relax. Just until you heal up 100%. Can I have a sandwich? What kind? Peanut butter and jelly. No, we're out of peanut butter and jelly. What about a mud, lettuce and tomato sandwich? Just joking. You're a bad Mom. I know. Come on. Go upstairs, clean up and I'll make you that sandwich. Gotcha, Mom. ''Thank you, Mom! '' You're welcome! Wil! Yeah! What's up, man? What's up? Look at your face. It looks just like mine. Yeah, what happened to yours? My bike fell. And you were on it, right? Mmm-hmm. What happened to yours? I fell on somebody's fist. Must have been a big fist. Yeah, it was. Me and Mommy gotta talk. Okay. So you go upstairs, you lock the door, I'll be up there soon. Gotcha. All right, come on. MILLIE: Hey, look who's back. Glad you're back. You know, Ana called like three times and you know something, she sounded really... What happened to you? Nothing, I got into a fight. Where? Doesn't matter, Ma. Please sit down so... No, no, I don't wanna sit. Just tell me what happened. Let me take a look at that. Ma, stop. Looks bad. Stop, stop. I just wanna talk. Okay. We'll talk. I'll listen and I'll make a sandwich for Randy, okay? How you been putting me through college, Mom? You're getting yourself through college, Son. You're really bright. Mom, please, it's important. All right, so what are you saying? How did I pay for your education? Does it matter to you? Yeah, it does. Why? Because maybe that's the reason why this is all happening. You know, I never questioned why we lived so well. Because it's all I knew. Buy another house. No problems, no questions asked. You know, come to think of it, Mom, I can't recall the last time you even had a job. Or at least one that didn't keep you away from me and Randy too long. How'd you do it? I wanna show you something. Have a seat. You'll learn something. Ay, nene, your becoming a man is getting real tiring. Okay, so... Okay, this is it. What? What is this? It's the investments we own and, yeah, some stocks I bought in the '80s, all of which put us in a position never to have to worry about money. Is this Microsoft stock? Yes, I was so stupid. I should have bought more. Wow. You had some serious investments. Yeah, I made some smart choices. Okay, so, I did my part. How'd you get your bruises? I went to Puerto Rico and I met with Javier Cordero. What did you do? He told me you took two million dollars. What did you do? Mom. What? Mom, what's wrong? Mom. Mom, what's wrong? I'm gonna kick your butt. Randy! Put on your jacket and meet me downstairs. I mean it. Hurry up! Mom. What's wrong? What's wrong? You got your gun? No. All right, take this. Why you giving me this? Because it's not about the fucking two million dollars! What are you talking about? Why do you think they let you live? He's in PR, Mom. I'm ready. He said something about a message. Sweet Jesus. Randy! Wilson! Go on. Mommy. It's gonna be all right, baby. Stay in here! They're gonna hurt Wil. No, I won't let that happen. Just keep your head down. RANDY: Mommy! Mommy! Mommy, where's Wil? Randy, stay in there! Mom! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Randy? Oh God! Oh no! Oh, please! Oh God! No! No! Mommy. RANDY: Mommy, where you going? Stay right here. Oh fuck. Okay, okay. Mom! Get in the house! You want me, motherfuckers? Come on! Come on! Mom, you're wide open. Come on, let's go, come on! Come on, Mom! MILLIE: Go get Randy, go get Randy and go down to the basement! WILSON: Mom... Do what I tell you! Just do what I tell you. Just back away from the door. Are you hurt? No. Okay. I want this to end. Wilson, I want this to end. Oh, God, I want this to end, Wilson! Mom. Oh, God, are you hurt? No, I'm okay. Mom. Mom, I'm okay. I'm just, I'm just so tired. I just... You're my heart. Baby, come here. Randy! Oh, baby. Are you okay? I'm okay, Mommy. Okay. I'm sorry, Mom. I should have known you were right. You understand, do you understand that I would do anything for you? I would do anything for you! I would do... I would do anything for you, Son. Mommy. It's okay. You're all right, okay? It's gonna be okay. You're my heart. My sons. Oh, God. My sons. Okay, Miss DeLeon, tell me from the top. From the beginning. There was two men. They came into the house. Miss DeLeon? If it's not about the money, then why? Because it's never about why with those kinds of people. It's about what's theirs. And about what's yours that's theirs. I don't understand, Mom. I said that it wasn't about the two million because it isn't. At least, not money that belongs to him. So the money does exist. My husband. Your father never skimmed money or stole from Javier Cordero. Ever dime that he worked for he earned. Work, Mom? Okay, what's that all about, Son? He was a drug dealer. He was a criminal. He was a good person who made bad choices. But if judging your Dad is something you need to do right now, Son, I'm gonna let you do it. But you still have so much to learn about life. Understand this. You wouldn't have had the good life that you've had up until now, if it wasn't for him. So if you're going to judge your father for wanting to provide us with a better life, then, Son, you're gonna have to do that with everyone else that you know who's made it. Because if you dig deep enough into people's lives, you're gonna find stains. Stains in all our histories. All right, let's go. No, I'm sorry, Mom, okay? Before we leave... The money. It still exists, right? The money is still in our possession and worth a lot more than two million, only now, thanks to Mom, it's legitimate tender, just like everyone else's. So, where do we go? This has to end. Why are you doing this to us? This is not about us. Like you said, if your mother has all the money she's ever going to need, then why are you doing this? Because I know now that it doesn't matter where we go. They're going to keep coming. They're not going to stop. Do you know what you sound like? I'm not a gangster, Ana! That's right, you're not a gangster, Wilson. It has to end! It has to end! This is too much. This is not why I got into this. Well, then why did you get into this? Why? Originally because I thought you were smarter than me. So, where do we go now? Now, you kiss me and you tell me that everything is going to be all right. Babe, look. Look at me. I swear to God, everything is going to be fine. Okay? Okay. What do you want me to do? Come here. Be careful. Be careful. SOLOMON: Wow. This your girlfriend? This is my mother. Mom, this is Solomon. (BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH) You're a baby! Where are we going? El San Juan Hotel. SOLOMON: This time you got a little more money? You could say that. (SPEAKING SPANISH) That's going to be great for my girlfriend. I'm going to come back for that. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Well, let's see. That's very nice. Yeah, it's simple but classy. Well, that's you, Son. I know. All right. So let's go. All right. Kids' toys get more expensive each day. (SPEAKING SPANISH) What's wrong? Let's bury this, shall we? (CELL PHONE RINGING) It's Ana. Talk to her. Hello? ANA. Wilson? Are you there? I'm here. I'm here. Ana... (SOBBING) I'm here. You've got to be strong, babe. And if I never see you again? That's not going to happen. How do you know? I just know. Look, I'm going to go now. I'll be back before you know it, okay? Okay. We can go home right now. No, we can't. You know something? You look just like your father. You do. I may sound like him and look like him, Mom, but I'm not him. I'm you. Everything that I am is you. I love you, Mom, and there's no going back. Okay, Son. Come on, baby. (REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) She's beautiful, isn't she? Her name is Mora. Isn't she beautiful? Yes, she is. Is she your daughter? No, that's not my daughter. That's my sister. She's the only family I ever had. She was 15 when I had that painting made, two years before she died. No disrespect. I'm sorry about your sister and all, but I'm here to talk about my mother. We're having the same conversation. What do you mean? She died in 1985. She used to live in New York. She wanted to go to New York University. At 15, she was the smartest girl on this island. JAVIER. I didn't have anyone in New York I could trust her with except for someone I trusted with my money. Your father. Compay Wilson. I didn't suspect a thing. Your father was making me so much money. She calls me. She tells me about the affair, tells me about how much she loved your father, but most of all, how much your father loved your mother. Your father was my age. My sister was 17. That's illegal in your country. By the time I got to New York to bring her back, she was dead. She killed herself and the baby she was carrying for one month. I thought killing your father would have done it for me. I couldn't understand why I felt so dissatisfied. But then it came to me. He killed the one person I love more than anything in the world. But I suppose things change. If he were alive today, you would be the one person that he would love more than anything in the world. Javier! (SPEAKING SPANISH) Come on. What's that? WILSON: Shit! Mom... Okay. It's okay. Come on, give it some gas, right now! All right, go a little faster, buddy, come on. Put your head down. What are you going to do? Put your head down, Wilson. Just stay close, Wilson, okay? He works for Cordero, Mom. I used to. You took care of that for me. No, he didn't take care of it. Don't give him the gun, Mom. Don't give him the gun. But this one? This one for me because this one's the one that got me my empire. Well, it's my time now. Let's go, Wilson. Why'd you have to give him the gun? Because sometimes you play the only chips you've got. (HORN HONKS) Not a good idea to be walking these streets at this hour. You're right. Okay, let's get in. Hop right in. How you doing, Solomon? SOLOMON: Going up with each morning and with the sun following me like madness. This is all they had. Sorry. I'm starving. Can I ask you something? Sure. When you spoke with Cordero, did you ask him why? Yeah. What did he say? It's about the money, Mom. Just like you said. Money. The money? Yeah. What do you know? It's all about the money with those kinds of people. Yeah, you're right. You tired? Yeah. Okay. Let's go home, Son. Okay. Okay. Dude! Where's my baby? Come here. Come here. I missed you so much. God, you need a haircut. Look who's here. Look who's there. Will! Come here. I missed you! I missed you. It's all good. Give me some. You the man. That's right. I could tell. Can I cut in? MILLIE: Come here. Hey. Hey. Thank you for taking care of him. He took care of me. Come on. Like a werewolf. Big. What are you telling her? What are you telling her? I'm telling her that your father has very big eyebrows. Cute. Like a werewolf. You're kidding me? Is that real? I still look forward to meeting your family.
