You have the little folded, without asking? She did not talk, Eli. Do you think now she's talking about, you pea brain? Get the mosquitoes. - I will. Get the mosquitoes! We need your birdbrain a little pimp, what? Yes? Or yes, sunshine? Eli, the woman wanted me to... That was fucking stupid of you, recklessly and amateurish. Now to listen to justify you, pull off and get me my money back! So good. Now let us first thing to go feed. Hey, he's back. Are you feeling better champion? Again HQ dam? I do not know, man. Thank you. Do you say it to me. I mean, I'm dreaming? Last night I was with my dream wife. The perfect woman. This was the perfect night, Lord God. Finally. And now you tell me that she was already dead, before this happened? I do not understand why do you say that again and again. Quite seriously. Do you hear please on it. You're making really finished. Do not tell me you were with her. - Damn it, I was with her! I do not spider yet. It is perhaps only one of your dream stories you already had in college, do you remember? The difference between dreams and reality disappears with you. There are not just dreams, okay? I have premonitions. - Premonitions? - Visions. Maybe it was a vision? - No... It was not. That was... - That was her spirit. Oh, my God, you were with her mind. Nonsense. - She was not ready to die. Maybe they had to and bring to an end, what they started for Leanne. Second. What? Hang on, how do you mean? Do not listen to Andrea, it has a small shot. No, ye do not understand? So it has been. No, it was not a ghost. So what does not exist. Do not tell me what it is or not. Not after that night. Let them talk. Go on. It's okay. Please. I want to know from you, how you meant that. Red on. Tell me everything. Okay? Please. Leanne. Leanne was her sister. And she has... No, she had this friend, this... Terry Jo, a madman. A drug dealer. So one who everywhere here sold on the streets of drugs. And outside in desert places. In the beginning it was just pot, but then was it Meth And Leanne has started to take it, okay? Eventually Terry Jo was you just overdosed and they... She died in it? Yes. And Monika had tried her away from it. From the fabric and Terry Jo, but it was too late. When she learned what Leanne had happened, what had happened to her... A week earlier, a week before her death, Leanne was with Monika and told of a big drug deal the Terry Jo should settle for his boss Eli. So a crazy Englishman, of like a cowboy lists. Terry Jo babbles interruption of this deal, to the eleven forty-five scheduled to depart at the Mann Street. Is supposed to be a bombastic deal. She knew the place and time, because he's told her time after sex. Eleven forty-five. Did it said a thousand times, over and over again. Tuesday at eleven forty-five at the Mann Street. Whenever he had sex, he had a big mouth. He trusts me to the cause. Me! Eli trusts me to the cause. He has described her everything minutely. 135 thousand. Do you know how much food that is? He was like a little boy. - You know what? This is so much material. This Monika knew and she wanted Terry Jo do. Her father was in Vietnam in a special unit and after a long police officer near Vegas. She found pleasure in the shooting. He taught her everything. She had nothing against and not afraid of anyone. So sets out to the guys surprise at the place of delivery. Terry Jo's been there before, but to pee times. I'll go piss. Monika has not notice anything and runs through the thing. Oh shit. Oh God! Fuck! She sees no Terry Jo. - Shit. But finds the money for it. Then appeared on the other cars. When Terry Jo comes to the car, are all dead and the money is gone. Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Fuck! Cursed. Terry Jo had to Eli and confess to him what happened. What? 135 one thousand U.S. dollars is a heap of coal for people like us. But there was something the Monika did not know. And that is, Terry Jo a few days previously Leanne as a Hi-Tech Smartphone had a birthday. In which they had all the names Phone numbers and addresses stored. Eli tear your ass up when we can not find the money. - Shut up. And then you showed up. I need to get some fresh air. Get out of the room. Get out of this town. I can not stand it here any longer. Wait a minute. Do you think she's still alive? Not alive and not dead What are you doing? It reported to the cops? I do not know, man. Should I Report, I fucked a dead? Yes? I can not now. I am sometimes away for a while. How's it going? Can we please go to the city? I want to go dancing and have a drink. Dancing. You want to go dancing? Okay. Then let me have fast the stinking waste rausbringen. Well, and then we go? - Then we go dancing. All right, let's... Double JayJay? Wow. Really great, what are you doing. The mess I'm sorry, man. Where is my cash, you starlet? Fuck you in the ass. You make me beforehand before but, how to do this, okay? It's beautiful here, is not it? We can thus no longer meet. Oh no? So is a figure of speech. Yes, I've heard that before. Not a nice phrase. You have to tell me what's going on. I have no idea. I just little. I can not remember anything more. At anything? - What was it. What was what? - What was for you. I saw both of us. And something that has not happened yet. What does that mean? It means that I see things. Does that mean you have visions? Something like that. I have premonitions, probably. I have both, you know? I dream things as well. Really hard. And I do not know how to arrange everything. Maybe we can help each other. I want to know what has happened in the past. And what do I do? - Sounds like you'd have to forget it. Yes. They say that you were dead. Assassinated would. This seems to be the case. But I'm not a ghost. People talk to me, take me. Are you undead? Looks like it. I'm probably because of them still there. Because of my sister. I want to accomplish, what I started. She was with the wrong people. You'll tell me, where the stupid money is. Because I know she betrayed it to her stupid girlfriend. And I know that their stupid girlfriend has told you. If not you tell me then I'll break more ribs, until you no longer have unbroken. And there is no more to break,... Then... I'll make you your pretty Cheap Movie Actors face a, to even it there is nothing left. No, that's good, wait. I'm telling you. You can even ask Monika. Namely, it is still alive. I swear. I swear to God. My Best Friend has it namely fucked last night. Toll. Last chance starlet. I told you, fuck yourself in the ass. Our friends are perhaps in danger. Why? - Because everyone who knows anything, is in danger. These guys are fucking dangerous. Believe me, I know. They killed Leanne. We were both adventurous, but I was more after my father. I had his self-control, which stemmed from his professional and from which, what he had been through during the war. Leanne was younger, and discipline is something the Younger always less understand. She began to take drugs. And that was more important to them over time when our family or college. I wanted to take her away from it. You have held like an animal. Already clear. Hey, boss! Hello? Over here. What fr'n drink do you want? - Two beer, okay? Here. From what kind of a neighborhood you come from? I'll be right with you, boss. What can I do for you? How about a Tequila? Blanco, only the finest. Coming right up. Salt, lemon? Without. Hello!

I wanted to the police. Oh well. The cops? Yes. I always wanted to fight against the bad guys. Daddy was twenty years cop and before seven years paratroopers. I have of him. What has stopped you? Leanne has come off the rails. She began early to drink and to party. And in college it started with the dope. And guess who has supplied thereby. Terry Jo. This stupid pig she learns know in Atomic, he gives her Meth She comes on it fully. I knew how it is to them and she had it taken away, before our parents mitkriegen what or before it goes. So I met with her, picked her up. We talked and the police stopped us. She had enough meth here, to hike for five years in jail. I took it on myself and put it in my bag before we were searched. Why did you do that? I thought of our father. If I'd say it's mine... You have sacrificed yourself. So did you but your dream job, So everything that you wanted to make, a messed up once and for all. It would have been better if I were purely hiked instead Leanne. She was my little sister. I would have died for them. It went so well. You have concealed it. Thanks to my father. From public reasons. But I could not come into the police service. Leanne has still not stopped. She was in too deep. Then she told me how Terry Jo started abzuzwacken a few dollars of each deal, to his addiction and his costly lifestyle fund. And every time he took it a little more. But one day he had kept too much. And Eli got it out. - I swear to you, I have nothing. You dirty, small, cheaters! - No! I have nothing! Then told Eli Terry Jo, it was Leanne and not him. And Eli said Terry Jo, he should take care of it. Finally, he missed her personally an overdose. At the she dies. I am sorry. What's for lunch? - Be not always so curious. Get out! Come out here! No. - Come on! - No, please do not. - Shut up! Hi, Thomas. How's your daughters? Looks as if a the two would have surprised you. Or? Right? Yes! You have looked at photos.
