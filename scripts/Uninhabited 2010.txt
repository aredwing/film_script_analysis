It is one of the world's largest coral reef ... and one of the seven natural wonders of the world. There are more than 600 islands ... and this is one of them. Jesus, wonderful. Come on. Here we are. Let's go. - Yes. Come on. - My God. Great. Look at it. Where is the coffee house? Listen, after a few days you do not need more coffee. Why did you bring me here to? It's terrible. Where do you draw the camp? There, in the southwest. - Okay. Need help, buddy? - No, thanks. Come on, let's take a look. Honey? - Yes? Come here. - Yes. It's so cool. - This is our home for 10 days. Ten days? We would have to stay here for a month. Thank you, Jackson. Is this the last? - That is the last. Okay, then we have everything. We need your distress signal connection box ... Have you satellite phone? - Yes, we have the satellite phone. If you want to leave earlier, you call me. I can within five hours, okay? Why would we want to leave earlier? Well, I'll see you later. - Thank you. See ya. Have a good trip, mate. Beth, that guy is ... - See you in 10 days. I see you in 10 days. Beth? Let us live here. Okay. - Okay? Yes. You are beautiful. I love you. Let's go swimming. - Yes. Do you know how to swim? Do you kidding me? Of course I know how to swim. Like a fish. Really? Why do you catch for our supper not? Really. Make it your way. Come on. I bet you there. There are stones in the sand. - That's coral, stupid. You're the fool. I felt something. It is an echinoderm, a sea cucumber. It looks like a big turd. - It's a delicacy. Turds that they have here is a delicacy? Just look out for sharks. Love you kidding me, right? It is the gray reef shark. They are small and harmless. Are you crazy? No shark is harmless. Honey anyway. We would have to swim naked. I'm ashamed. - You're ashamed? Why? In the event that a bus of tourists arrive? There was a snake down there. That's a moray. Just keep your hands away from his mouth. "O Tell me what else is in the sea. Well, there are sharks, snakes, rays, stingrays. And on the reef, there are deadly snails and fish. Are you afraid? Bang? I? Let me tell you something. I am not afraid. Except for you. Look at this. What is it? Footsteps. - Footsteps? They are not yours, do you? No, they're not mine. They are too small. They go in that direction. It's like someone came from the reef. Come on. Should we follow them? - Let's take a look. They look fresh. I thought you said we were the only one here? I thought so. There are still people who camp on the other side. That is not nice. That someone looks at us as we sleep. It is probably a child. Come on, this is gonna be fun. Let's find him. Yes. - And it 'panties run. You do not. - I'm joking. Where have they gone? - They have stopped. That's odd. - Okay, let's look around. Okay. - Come on. "Hello?" You would have to film the island. Yes, but I want the handsome man filming. A great idea from me, right? Yes, great idea, Harry. Did not you go to Fiji? Fiji? With five star hotels? - No. Hey, this is pretty cool. What is that? Is there anyone there? What are you looking? Strange, there are just shells. Really? On a beach? Hey, this movie. spectacular Hey, paparazzi. More legs show. And now the eyes. Very nice here. Come on, together. Look. Harry, come on. Just the two. This place is incredible. There is no noise of the machine. Nothing. I've never heard. So primitive. - Here, look here. The leaves resemble algae. Let's collect what, we can scroll soup. You can find it here cool, right? You look happy. I'm happy. You, me, the island. I still have not seen anyone. They are probably deeper into the island. Are we not leave? Yes. We should be exploring. - Never mind. I'm not going to go. Come on, let's camp, it gets dark. "O Have you ever had a tent? Yes, really Himalaya, were you not there? No, you are your girlfriends to confuse. Yeah, probably. That should be here and then ... Yes, that must be there. And this goes here. And then you so ... And this comes out. And then along here, such as this. Do you know this book? The book about tents? You have it written. Yes. My God, it's beautiful here. This island appears on the island where I once went for my course. The reef structure, the trees, the birds ... it is amazing. You go here do not work? - No, I'm on vacation. That is a promise, right? Not much work. I mean, now I'm here, I can do just as well. No way. Say it. No work. Good. - Only we, I promise. Will you come help finish? Yes. It should here. And so ... Ga off. Go find some deadwood. Let me help you. Come on. - No. Go away. - Let me help you. I'll get you later down. Go write another book about tents. Do you mind? It's nice. - Yes? And the music? Like that well? It's good. -Yes? - Yes, it is good. It is a small group of islands that were the caiman occur. Yes? I think it's good. Not as good as this paste. It's great. Fun. You need me to travel like this. Indeed, I would have to take more. No beans on toast ... but decent meals. That is over. - Excellent, good. We should go fishing tomorrow. What coral trout catch, maybe some lobster. We can try some echinoderm. - Do they have lobster here? Yes. Great. What is an echinoderm? A sea cucumber. Remember the snail-like we saw? Want to eat? People ate them all in the 20's around this island. Did they do that? - Yes. Apparently it is an aphrodisiac. What do you mean by that? Nothing. I will let you look aphrodisiac. Maybe what you do in your pasta? Yes? I doubt that that will not be necessary. Listen to this. - What are they? Old bones. May I look at it? I found them in the woods. What are they? Well, no bird bones. They are too big. But there are no large animals on this island. strange Are we on our guard against big chicken? Maybe. What will you do with all those hours? That's a secret. So, the first night in the tent together. This is of interest. - Yes, and we must make. What is wrong? What do you mean, what's wrong? The two sleeping bags. Yes, one for me and one for you. No. Yes, it's like in the 50's. I have my integrity. No, we sleep together. Really? - Yes, really. Does it hurt? - Yes, it hurts. Honey anyway. Harry, what is it? Did you hear that? - What? A wind chime. It is a gust, which is al But there is no wind. It's nothing. Come on. Did you hear that? What was that? I don't know. That sounds like mockery thrushes. Come on, let's go back to bed. It's nothing. Come on. Harry? Outside Sounds always scared to hunt me. Someone has gone through my stuff. What do you mean? They have hung in the tree. What? - All my underwear. Look, these are the same footprints as before. Come on, come forth. Hello? Is there anyone there? We know you're here. We find you. "Hello?" "Hello?" Come on. Hello? - Hello? It was a monkey. I'm sure. There are no monkeys on this island. Maybe some children. Yes, that would probably scare us. Yes, they are doing well. We need to go fishing now the tides are good. Look, a starfish. That is wonderful. We'd better put back. - It's cute, like your ass. No, you have the cutest ass here. Okay, let's hold a contest. This is an echinoderm. Remember what I said about it? A sea slug. - A sea cucumber. You know everything, right? I love this stuff. I think I've seen our fish. A little one there. They are probably too small to catch. Stop! - What? Stay where you are. What? What is it? Remain still. Do not move, okay? Do not move. Are you okay? - Yes, keep this for a while. And these. What is it? It looks like a lump of coral. That makes them so dangerous. It's easy to kick them, but if you do ... It is a fish. You look scary. Do not! It's a stonefish. And it's a big one. See those spikes? - Yes. If they come through your shoes, you're dead within half an hour. It is one of the deadliest creatures on earth. And you hold it? Yes. Okay, enough. Put it back down please. - Okay, I know how I should deal with it. You're crazy. - I'm not crazy. I'll show you. Give me my ... It does not matter that you're a marine biologist. It's okay. Give me my things again. Are you okay? Yes, go around. - Okay. Look where you go. - Come on. No more. Along there. Here you are. Are you ready to catch fish? Sharks, but what caught harmless sharks. What? - I was aiming for a big fish ... and I let the spear fall. Are you lost? - Yes. My God, Harry. I do not see him. You're kidding. - No. tremendously Every thing that I wanted to hit, I missed. Yes? Yes, but I saw a big turtle. Really? How big? - Yes. I do not know, three feet across. So large? - Yes, so great. If I was still there, we ate turtle soup tonight. Yes, I know. But that is how you lose a hand peer. Sorry. - That's okay. What was that? I do not know. Come on. It sounded like someone crying. How come we have not seen before? Not a clue. "Hello?" "Hello?" This place is so old. Smell. All these pieces of the 20's. Harry, come and see. What's the matter? Yes. It seems like it is here for an eternity. That hut must have been left behind by the Tripangboeren. Yes, there are some interesting pictures hanging on the walls. Cool. - Yes. Where is the camera? Have you seen it? - No. It is not where it normally is. Did you know him last? - Yes. Here it is. That's odd. Are you sure you're not using it? No, I'm not using it. Come here to watch. What is it? All you've filmed? I'm such a moron. Look, he has her in his nose. - You're an idiot. I love you too. The island looks great. Yes, except him. I think it is. I go back to the hut. What's This? what? Jesus Christ Harry. Damn. Okay. Who did that? The little bastards bags? This is not funny, Beth. I wanna go home. Do you want to go home? Beth, we can talk about it? Where is the satellite phone? What is there to talk about? I want to go. - Okay, look, Beth. What kids thought our cameras, the same that the footprints left behind. They get a sick joke, okay? I do not like when they shoot us while we sleep. It pleases me either. - What will we do about it? We will make sure that it does not happen again. No, I want to go. - Come on, Beth, let's not overreact. What? What do we do? We let them ruin this trip, okay? They've already done. - No, I have as yet. You have amused unwise since we are here. Okay? You are fully blossomed. I've still not so happy since ... I'm not happy, okay? Neither do I. I do not want this to happen ... What will we do? - Come on. We're going to not let it ruin our vacation, okay? "O This we do. They are here on the island. So we are not alone and that's a fact. We are going to camouflage ... or something like that. Okay? Really. We will leaves us hanging like this ... and we find them and we're going to scare them ... and we'll get them back. Okay? Because this is not cool. No. - I would not ruin things. Let's make a game of it. Come on, say okay. - Okay. Come on, here they are not. Was that a gunshot? I don't know. It comes from the boat. They are killing sharks. Harry, he has a gun. They look at us. Come on, we go further. The wind sounds like fun. Yes. Hey, Beth? Why do they want us mad? You know, with the video and stuff. I don't know. Those guys have not made the footprints. They were too big. And why did it not last? What was that? "O behold I'll look around. You stay here, okay? Stay here. Jesus Christ I am sorry. What are you doing here? - I was not alone. Stay here, okay? Jesus, who would have done this? The guys who have the boat. I get the creeps here, Harry. Yeah, me too. I want to sleep in the open tonight. - Okay. I want to see what is going on. Okay, of course. It's okay. Do not worry. What are they? - Sea cucumber. Whoever did this knew what they were doing. See how sharp that knife must have been? Yes. This is no joke of a small child. I wanna go home. - Yes, okay. Where's the phone? I don't know. Harry, he is not where we left him. Okay, here it is. The phone is gone. - What? The phone is gone. - How is that possible? Harry, calm down, okay? Harry? "Thank you." Where is it? No English. We do not speak English. Nonsense. That's not funny. I'm tired of these games, okay? I just want the satellite phone and get out of here. I'm tired, okay? "O I am tired, she is tired, and you can give him better back, okay? Speak English. - Calm, Harry. What's so funny? You love us for fools. - Harry. You sabotaged the tent, you stole the satellite phone and I want him back. Come on. - No way. Speak English. - Calm, Harry. I'm serious, I've had enough. Say hello, say something, but speak English. Hello. - Hello? You bastard! Let go. Harry. Do not touch me. Harry. Let him go. Let me go. Do not touch me. Do not touch me. Harry. Are you okay? Come with me. - There you'll not get away. He has a gun. Harry, come on. I'll be back for that satellite phone, okay? Harry, let it go. Come on. Does it hurt? No. It's okay. Thanks. The phone was not in the camp. He must be there. - No, not really. I've looked. Where else could it be? I'll look twice. Harry, wait. Do you see them? - No. Be cautious Okay, they're gone. They would not just leave. It is not there, it's not here and did not. This is not. It should be in the boat. "Hello?" "Hello?" Help Go away. Go away. Go away. What are you doing? Leave her alone. No, do not. Get off her. Fuck you, pig. You, asshole. I'll kill you. I love you Get it off me. Come on. Harry, they come. Come on, hold on. Stay with me. Let's go. - Fast. There is a spirit on this island. "O Have you read this? Once I scrolled. Her name is Coral. That is her grave there. She was a young girl and worked for the Tripangos in the 20's. She lived here. One day, she stood on the reef to collect sea cucumbers ... and she stepped on a stonefish. The poison began to work ... but they hit back at the coast. And the boys of the company were waiting for her to. She laughed at her and raped her. Seven men. There are seven characters on the wall there. She died. - Okay? And since then, she takes revenge on all men who come here. And you believe this? - Listen here. Coral has a knife. She uses it to cut sea cucumber. She was angry last night. Jim. Come on, are you serious? What? Do you think it's funny? "Of course. Waiting to see the spirit Coral ... I hope they give me a blowjob as the other. And then further ... - Okay, here it is. Coral gave us a visit last night, at least I think so. I'm not sure if it was a dream. She was very beautiful, I watched her all night. I tried to approach her, but she disappeared. You really believe this. - Yes, indeed. It makes sense. It is not useful. Look at everything that has happened since we arrived here. What happened last night with those guys. Why she left so suddenly. Where they shot at? They shot at each other. Of course. Listen to me. Later, Coral ... Listen to me. Coral was fucking with Bobby yesterday evening. A lot. Serious thing. I do not know if he makes it. Okay, Beth, someone wrote this ... people like us for the fool. It's a joke. They do not fool us. - They love you for a fool. Since ... we landed two days ago ... the staff is missing. A hole in our canoe, we can not on the island. I do not know how it happened. We are here alone. It must be the spirit, right? - What nonsense. Okay. A fool came here and thought it was a good idea to keep a diary to write ... that frightens people and then leaving the island for themselves. That is wrong. And now people come there and write everything in. It's just a big joke. They even have a tomb placed. Listen, Hendo is missing. I can not find him anywhere. I have searched all over the island ... - I do not hear. Many blood. - Please. What happens here, dammit? Can we discard? It bothers me now. If you read this diary and you're on the island, there is a spirit here ... and they will kill you. Get out, quick. Come on, it's ridiculous. You should not be so upset about this. It's terrible what happened to her fate. If it happened. If it happened. Do not touch me. - Honey. Harry, how you want your fish cooked? How do you like your fish? Put him in aluminum foil and make him so ready. I'm sure they exist. I went to the shed and heard someone moaning. Well, I also heard something. It was the wind. It was no wind. - Come on. I heard it. It was a person. - No. Okay, this had a lot more sense if this is a reality TV show. On this island, this was a big conspiracy .. Did you see the drawings on the wall does not? It can be part of it, you know. No. I can understand why she wants revenge. - What? If someone did to me ... Would you murder innocent men? I would be angry, yes, absolutely. Jesus Christ That is how wars begin, Beth. Stop it. She was raped seven times, and they laughed while they did it. Look how angry you were correct. Imagine what it would be. That's happened a hundred years ago, okay? One hundred years ago and she is dead now. And? - And? Why are we fighting about? Nothing ever dies. Things just reform. No. I can feel it. Okay then. Listen ... if they are on this island and murdered innocent men ... what's going to happen to me, huh? What's going to happen to me? The fate comes after you, buddy. / i Time to go now. / i Do not fool around with you. / i Look at me. / i They will murder you. You're next. / I Do not be silly. Leave now. / I Get out of this island is. / i She gives you the latest worry, pal. / i Get out. / i What's this? behold Okay, we have of this island, now. That is, do those legs open. / i That's it, but do them well open. / i What? I'll get you again, Coral. - What is this? What's This? Do you like that? Do you not there? / I I'm sorry, but what I like. I do really, Coral. / I Coral. - Do you like that? / I That's it, come on. / i Come on, where are they? Who are you? What do you want? Coral. Someone at home? THE END
