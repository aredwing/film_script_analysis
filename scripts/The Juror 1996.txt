Please take your time in answering this question. Take a good look at Mr. Boffano. Have you ever seen him before? - No. sir. I haven't. - Would you speak into the mike? - No. sir. I haven't. - Not on TV or in the newspapers? - Do you read newspapers? - When I have the time. - How often is that? - Never. I'm a single mother and I'm trying to be a sculptor. I have a job and a son to take care of. I feel stupid saying I don't keep up with the news. but I don't. - You've not heard about this case? - I have heard something. My son said I might get picked for the big mafia case. I said, "What big mafia case?" He said. "Louie Boffano." "He's gonna be tried for popping those guys." I said. "Who's Louie Boffano?" He said, "He's the big spaghetti." Okay, people, enough. This may be a lengthy trial and you could be sequestered. If you tell me this would prove a hardship to you, I'll excuse you. I could get someone to take care of my son when I'm sequestered. So you would like to serve? Yes. I would. The car's registered to Annie Laird. 48 Seminary Lane, Pharaoh, N.Y. - Were you a star today? - No. I was a zero kid. Do you know where Jesse is on Dragon Rider? The fifth dome. I can't make the second dome without Troll Slayer clobbering me. - Maybe Nintendo's not your forte. - It's Sega. You should focus on something else, like your homework. You were a star in county court today. I told them you called Louie Boffano the big spaghetti. - You're on that case? - If they take me. She just picked up her kid. We're going west on Ratner. Thank you, Eddie. Stay with her. I'm gonna check out her place. They killed the old godfather and his grandson. It made me start thinking about you. I've told you about responsibility. Okay! It wasn't such a good idea, but it is a little bit exciting. I need a little excitement. - Eddie, what's going on? - We're at some kind of church. Maybe she's a religious freak. I think we ought to let this one go. - She's at work. Relax. - Yeah. whatever. Anything at all about the trial, you have to cut it out. - You don't read the paper. - Whatever, just do it. While the jury deliberates you'll have to stay with Mrs. Kolodny. - For how long? - However long it takes. Tell me you're kidding. You go in, you come out, and you say "guilty". Say, "Fry the sucker!" How long does that take? Six seconds? End it: "Sincerely, John Slivey, Devotional Services, Inc." Math... now! GOD IS MALE She's walking towards the car with her kid. - What do you think of her? - I don't think nothing. - Do you think she's sexy? - Come on, she's a mommy. I think she's sexy and smart. This isn't your average mommy. - I think she's trouble. - I think she's brilliant. She makes sculptures that you have to feel. Get out of there. She's coming your way. They just turned into the driveway. Get the fuck out of there. They're at the front door. Go out the back. What the fuck are you doing? They're going in the front door. Get out the back. Come on. I'm hungry. Is there anything to eat? It's your duty to feed me. I can't do it, I'm too busy... beating your butt at Dragon Rider! Turn on the machine. and I'll call for pizza. - Get it with sausage. - Get out of my face. - Sausage is good. - I'd like to order a large pizza. Use your axe! Turn around. - Die, you sucker! - Hit him again. - Don't let him get away. - I got him! I did it. All right! Chill out, Momba. - He's right there. - Don't get hit by the fist. I'm gonna get him. You cannot run from the wrath of Momba! - Hey, Lainie. Is she here? - Yeah, she's coming right out. SOLD Mark Cordell. He's very polite, but he can be intimidating. He knows his shit. He does Alice Aycock and Christy Rupp. He collects for himself and friends. and some big collectors. - Like? - Sato Makamoto. Bidi Karamora. - My stuff's going to Japan? - I don't know. - You didn't ask him? - Of course, but he gave me vague. - And that was good enough for you? - That, and a check for $24,000. - Half of which is yours. - God. do I need this. Annie Laird? Inez said you might drop by. I bought some of your pieces. I'm Mark Cordell. - I've got a check in my bag. - That's hardly what they're worth. - How do you know me? - Inez showed me your picture. - Are my pieces going to Japan? - That's likely. - I'm not going to see them again? - Not necessarily. Do you have time for lunch? I'm supposed to be upstate by two o'clock for jury duty. - I wouldn't want to make you late. - Maybe just a quick bite. - What was the first one? - Let me see... The very first. When my parents split up, I stayed with my grandmother. I hated it. I made a model of a wild meadow. I kept it under the bed. Thorns were made out of staples. A stream was made from tin foil. I would reach under the bed... I was afraid of the dark. I would reach under and touch it and dream I was there. - And that's how you got started? - Yeah. Were you afraid of the dark? There wasn't much dark in my house. We were a lot of kids. I was the youngest. It was a real madhouse. A zoo. You want to know where your pieces are going? Do you know Japan? Contemporary art is a sort of currency there. It's value is so inconstant. It's so attractively pliant. Wait... I'm lost. I'm not connecting the dots here. We need to get your pieces traded. Record some six-figure sales. A review in Art Forum. A place at the Basel Art Fair. - But that's my job. - Listen. Mr. Cordell... - Please. call me Mark. - Okay, Mark... - May I call you Annie? - My art is not a kind of currency! What do you think I get out of this? Money? I don't need to. I earn a very good living... Not now. I do this so that artists like you can go into your studios - - and not worry whether or not your children are being fed. So that these idiots that control the art world. these insects... You don't have to bother with them. You just do your work. Hey, you guys, what do you think? Pay up... Wear the black one. You look sexy in it. I don't want to look sexy. I'm not wearing the black one. - Don't be shy with this guy. - I'm not shy. - I'm private. - You clam up. - I just don't babble to men. - Babble is an art. First you pep up his ego. Then you puncture his balloon. Then you stroke his ego again. You push him and you pull him... Until you've got him dizzy and falling at your feet. When's the last time you slept? You mean like closing my eyes for a second while doing a tracheotomy? I slept for a couple of hours Monday night. - Why aren't you at home in bed? - I'm taking the kids to a movie. How could I not come? Today was the triumph of your life. What? You, you did it. - What did I do? - You sold three pieces. You know what? I did! Lao-Tzu says that returning is the movement of the Tao. - So are you a Taoist? - I don't know. When I first heard of it. I laughed out loud. But I also find it very compelling. Become a valley. Stop fighting against structure and fate - - and everything will flow to you. - What do you think? - I think we need to take a left. - Should I just..? - Yeah, any one. It doesn't matter. - Stick my hand under and... - Cop a feel. "The Dream of Giving Notice." - What do you feel? - A keyboard. A computer keyboard. Something rough on the keys. Is it sandpaper? And this is wire. This is a cage. This is a birdcage. I'm caught in a birdcage. The door is open, but I can't quite squeeze through. Now I feel a breeze on my fingers. How did you do that? And now a fluttering. This is a bird. This is amazing. It's also strange, reaching up under here and feeling your... - Private stuff? - Private stuff. My God, Annie, it doesn't have to only be a dream. You can give notice. You can escape that hell. You can do nothing but make art for the rest of your life. Would you like to feel another one? There's a good one over there. - This one? - Yeah, that one. I've already felt that one. - No, I just finished that one. - I felt it... yesterday. - I didn't know you yesterday. - But I was here. You're kidding, right? Don't get up! Listen to me now. - You and your son are in danger. - Where's my son? He went with Juliet to the movies. He's gonna be all right. He's such an extraordinary child. I heard you playing the video game. You started to panic and he said. "Chill out. Momba." - How do you know that? - Annie... When I heard the two of you laughing, I swore to myself - - that I would help him get through this. This is a very dangerous time for him. He could stray, commit some childish error and we could lose him. That quick! But I think he's gonna be safe. He'll grow up and be healthy. Juliet will be fine. Everyone you care about will be safe as churches. Do you hear what I'm saying? Nod your head now. Do as I say. And as for you... All you have to do is wait. Someone will contact you and tell you to say two words. Two, precisely. Do you know what they are? Have you guessed yet? No? Not guilty. Okay, see you later. What do you want me to do? Protect him. Tell him that your date turned out to be a creep. - Hi, honey. - Are you all right? Yeah. It's nice to see you. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Did you have a good time? - Yeah. What's the matter? - My date wasn't so great. - Is he still gonna buy your boxes? - It doesn't matter. - Are you okay? - Fine, I'll be up in a minute. Just go on. - I'll still buy your boxes. - I don't want you to. This will all be over soon. - Annie, what's up? - Boone? - Yeah. it's me. - How are you? I'm good. I have to put money in the phone. It's the 1950's here. It's gonna sound like we're disconnected. - That's better. - At last I got a chance to call. - How long has it been? - Probably the fall. Is it really that long ago? I'm hours from the nearest phone. How are you guys? How's Oliver? - Are you there? - Yeah... - We're okay. - I thought I'd lost you. - Book your airline early this year. - We won't be able to make it. You'll miss the fiesta. Why? Listen, you can't keep popping up into my life whenever you want. What's the matter? I have someone here and he doesn't like these phone calls. Sorry, I didn't know. - Are you okay? - Yeah, if I can get back to sleep. Goodnight, Annie. The Teacher says, "The man won't come out of his house to be killed." "So what we can do is, dig a tunnel." Remember, Paulie? I said, "You want to dig a tunnel?" "Okay, dig a tunnel. Just kill that cocksucker." - Mr. DeCicco, is that your voice? - Yeah. It's you and Buffano talking about the Teacher. - Who is this Teacher? - I don't know. - Why is he called the Teacher? - When you see him, school's out. - School's out? Meaning? - It means you're fucking dead. Mr. DeCicco. not here. - You dealt with him directly? - No, he does jobs for Louie. You said the Teacher had suggested working with the Cali drug cartel. And that the Teacher had linked Louie to the Calabrian mafia. Two alliances Salvatore Riggio bitterly opposed. Then the Teacher suggested tunneling into Riggio's house to kill him. And Louie Boffano said. "Okay, dig a tunnel." - After all. the Teacher's the boss. - The Teacher's not the boss. - His counsel is always followed. - Louie gives the orders. You mean. Louie seems to give the orders. Do you know what a puppet is? - Objection. - Let me put it another way. This is a puppet. It doesn't make its own decisions. - Objection! - This is not a circus. - I withdraw the puppet. - Strike that from the record. Put that puppet away. I just sustained an objection to it. Oliver! - Get down here. - Anybody here? What's this? I told you never to come here. I need some help. Could I get a few bucks on next month's rent? - What the fuck is this? - Don't touch that! It's a piece of art. It's a very delicate piece of art. There you go. You have got to meet Lorraine. - Who's Lorraine? - My girlfriend. What's this? More art? That's my girlfriend. And these are all pieces of art. I didn't want you dropping by unexpectedly. I'm working on some very important pieces. Yeah... I'll see you later. I don't want to discuss this. Get your coat on. There's nothing to eat in this house. Hey, I know you. You're the artist. The box lady. Mark Cordell bought a couple of your pieces. Is this your kid? How you doing? Nice to meet you. Remember those frozen things you like? - RoboPops? - Yeah, go get some. Tomorrow morning, 7 a.m. The Park and Ride in Banktree. - What did I say? - The Park and Ride in Banktree. - What time? - 7 a.m. Look... you'll be fine. We're not animals. I've got a kid, too. A teenager. I know what you're going through. Hang in there. What's your name? - I can't tell you my name. - What do I call you then? Captain Crunch. Captain, thanks. How are you holding up, Annie? How have you been feeling? - You tell me. You listen in. - I don't enjoy it. - You don't? - No. But we can't afford the slightest error. I think you're being a little harsh with your child. - He may start to ask questions. - He won't. I want to finish this quickly, but I'm going to need your help. - We have to work together. - I'll do what I can. Do you understand what our strategy was in the courtroom yesterday? Boffano didn't order the killing. He's in the mob as a figurehead. - He doesn't give orders. - That's right. If Louie Boffano isn't guilty, then who did kill Salvadore Riggio? You did. You think I'm the Teacher? - Aren't you? - I would have you believe that. The Teacher scares you, doesn't he, Annie? I'm sorry for the fear. If I had any choice... Any choice... But if I can keep you scared, I can save your life. He got down on the bed between us. He put his gun on Sal's mouth. - What did the man do then? - He said, "Open up, Sal." "I don't want to scare your wife. We've got to work together." - And then? - Then he killed my husband. - What happened next? - The door opened and my... Mrs. Riggio... did someone come in? Tommy, my grandson. He came in the room. He saw Sal dead. The man saw my baby. Tommy ran down the hall. The man ran after him. I heard the shot. He killed my baby. No further questions. Oliver! Juliet called again ...for the tenth time. You're supposed to be doing your homework. Goodbye, Jesse. See you later. - Who cut up the paper? - I did. You told me to. You never do anything I ask you to. Why did you have to do this? - What did it say? - You're not supposed to know that. You said you weren't supposed to know what's in the paper, right? Don't tell me right from wrong. What the hell did it say? - I don't know. - Is Boffano guilty? - I don't know. - Do they think he's guilty? Everybody knows he's guilty. What's the matter? - Everybody? Who have you talked to? - Nobody. You asked me not to. You talk to anybody about this, and I will beat the shit out of you. Do you understand me? That bullshit crybaby stuff stops right now! I can't do this... - Where is everybody? - Did I get this wrong again? - When were you told to be here? - Now. - Maybe they're on the old field. - Get back here. Oliver, I don't want you going. - We need to talk. - I have to go. Walk with me. - What if I were in trouble? - What kind of trouble? - Really bad trouble. - What? A man. or work? - What if I couldn't tell you? - I'm your best friend. - So you would tell me? - Of course. Then do that. - I can't say. I don't have a kid. - You love him as much as I do. Tell me what you'd do, Juliet. I think you've got to go to the judge. Tell him that your son just got diagnosed with leukemia. - He's not gonna buy that. - Yeah. he will. If you have a note from your doctor. From me. I don't know... - It sounds sort of crazy. - Is helping the mafia any smarter? - Why did you say..? - I don't take orders very well. From monsters. I don't take them at all. He's your kid, Annie. Once we're back in the car. we never talk about this. Not a word. Not a question. Say, "I'll never talk about this." - I'll never talk about this. - Not in the car or in the house. - I knew it. God! - You're just too smart. I'm glad you figured it out. And I'm glad you went to Juliet. - Are you scared? - Yeah. We'll turn this thing around. - May I help you? - I need to see the judge. - What are you doing here? - I need to see you. - You're a juror. Open that door. - I want to talk to you alone. When you come into my chambers, it is not a trivial thing. When a juror visits a judge, it can have serious consequences. If you still have a problem, and you want to talk about it, - - I'll call the attorneys. I don't want them. I only want to talk to you. Alone? You can't talk to me alone. Whatever that is. I won't see it without the attorneys present. Are you telling me I'm making a mistake? I gave you every opportunity to get out of serving on this jury. You insisted. You wanted jury duty. Do you recall? If you have a problem, the defendant has the right to hear it. He happens to be on trial for murder. He has every right to hear it. - Shall I locate his counsel? - No, I've changed my mind. You and your '73 Knicks. Imagine Earl the Pearl playing against John Stark. Earl the Pearl would blow John Stark out of the Garden. - John Stark would take Earl... - Annie! I'd like you to meet Rodney. - Your girl's a fucking knockout. - Rodney's spouting sewage. Bullshit! I've offered to drive Rodney home because he's had too much to drink. - Would you like to ride with us? - I have my own car. Get in the back seat. I want Annie to ride up front. Rodney is not making a great success of his life on earth. - He's a drunk. an imbecile. - Button up that bung hole. But his friends take care of his DUI's. and he's still on the road. You said you had some scotch. Break it out. shit for brains. Annie, there's a bottle in my bag. - This? - Don't spill any, Rodney. - I'm not sticking this in my face. - It won't affect my regard for you. Asshole! Lie down. I put something in there to make you sleepy. - What are you doing? - I'm doing Rodney. Seeing what life is like through Rodney's eyes. It's just like I thought. It is one big blur. Look at Rodney now. He's just like the rest of us. Spending all of his time trying to stay out of the way of fear. Anything to not feel fear. - Don't you ever feel fear? - All the time. I had a bout today. I bow to fear. It's terror that teaches me my shape. Do you understand what I'm saying? Lacrosse. The most dangerous sport in the country. But if it wasn't dangerous, then young boys wouldn't want to play it. Oliver plays lacrosse, doesn't he? - What are we doing here? - I want to teach you what you love. The grey suits want you to love the law and justice. But what good are the grey suits? Are they going to shield you? Can the grey suits shield you from somebody like me? Look at me. I'm Rodney. I'm old and I'm tired. But when I get behind the wheel I'm a young buck again. I might take this curve here a little too fast. Stop! I didn't tell the judge! I swear! - Who's gonna protect you, Annie? - You will. - I want you to say it! - The Teacher will protect me! - Say it again! - The Teacher will protect me! You can put the Teacher in jail. You can sizzle Louie Buffano. But what are you gonna do about this drunken Rodney? I'm looking down this road and it's just one big blur to me! I think I see a boy on a bicycle. He looks a lot like... No! - Who will protect you? - The Teacher. - Who will shield you? - The Teacher. - Just you. - The teacher will protect you. Again! Here. - You can't let him drive like that. - You're absolutely right. He could hurt somebody. Make sure she gets home safely. Where are you going? - Why did he do that? - Because you scared him. Don't ever do that again, because he will hurt you. I don't want to see you get hurt. - You said you had a kid, Captain? - Eddie. My name is Eddie. I've got a daughter. Why do you let him do these things? You've got too many questions. Come on, let's get out of here. - Could we go to the mall later? - No. - Get some ice cream? - No. I wanted to tell you about my day, you know. - Did you talk to Juliet today? - No... Finish your homework. - He was cute. - Will you examine me like that? You wish! You're on call Saturday night. You said he could be reasoned with. but he can't. - What happened? - Your idea didn't work out. - You have to stay out of our lives. - And that's what Oliver wants. too? Oliver thinks we should be heroes. but he's wrong. He'll keep his mouth shut and that's all that matters. - You've got to promise, too. - To abandon you? Keep your mouth shut and stay out of our lives. It's my life, that's what you said. My life, my kid. Right? Promise me. I promise you. Hi, Oliver. - Oliver! - Puberty. Guilty. Guilty. Not guilty... That's what it says. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty... Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Not guilty. - Ten guilty and two not guilty. - How can this guy not be guilty? - Who voted not guilty? Can I ask? - Yes, but no one has to say. I voted not guilty. I don't think the government proved its case. - Proved? It's open and shut. - So you say. - You heard the tape, right? - So you say. Suppose the witnesses were lying. We've still got the tape. It's on the tape that he talks about the tunnel. "If you want to dig a tunnel, dig a tunnel. Kill that cocksucker." Do you think he's talking about the tunnel of love? - Hold on... - Are you the other one? Does that tape prove anything? It wasn't a direct order. - "Kill that cocksucker." - He could've just been bragging. He was bragging about having Riggio killed. Maybe it's not fair to pick on the not guilties. We should explain our case and our evidence. This is ridiculous. We'll be stuck in that motel for weeks. Despite the state's evidence against mob boss Buffano, - - speculation turns towards the possibility of a hung jury. I want to know why you're not leaning on the union guy. - He's not powerful enough. - Is that right? - And this artist broad has power? - We hope so, yeah. Go with the union guy. When my father's away, I'm the boss. So listen to what I'm telling you. Joseph. What the fuck are you talking about? Go back to the car. Let me ask you something. - Do you take money from my family? - Yes, but you're not in charge. Your father knows what's going on. I don't like you, okay? I don't like what you do for us. I don't like these Cali assholes. These fucking guys from Calabria..! You act like you're some sweet-smelling piece of shit. You're from the same neighborhood I'm from, that my father's from. I think you're a sick fuck. I know you're a friendless fuck. You always were. Eddie brought you into the family, but even he don't like you. Nobody likes you. - I've got work to do. - Listen to me! Go with that union guy. When your room-mate falls asleep come out on the balcony. Annie... come here. Take this and stand over there. Pretend to be smoking. I want you to know you're never out of my thoughts. - Will we win? - No. - Why not? - He's guilty. The others know it. If the jury hangs, the people I work for will punish you and me. That's not part of the deal! I just vote not guilty... No, we have to have an acquittal. We have to win this thing. - You're out of your mind. - That's why I chose you. - I know who you are when you try. - I cannot turn black into white. You can teach them about Boffano. No brains, no courage. A clown. But you can do what I'm asking you because you have the spine. You and I have that in common. We're artists. We're intelligent. But Louie Boffano? Please! - What do you want me to do? - The jury's instinct is to acquit. You can march in there and give them the excuse to do it. I can't. You will. I got you something. And I want you to wear it. Please take it. Don't worry, I'll be with you every step of the way. You're being unreasonable. People testified against the Teacher. You're being unreasonable. People testified against the Teacher. - How can you say he doesn't exist? - I don't know who he is. But you know how powerful he is. Didn't that get through to you? Annie... There's no need to raise your voice here. - Are you crazy? Kayaking? - I love ocean kayaking. Down south at night. There's this phosphor in the water. - What would you like? - Fruit punch. It's like... lit. It's an amazing thing to see. - You're quite a free spirit. - Well, you know... After this is over. we could go kayaking on the Hudson sometime. That could be really great ...sometime. Really? That's cool. When they said the name Teacher, they were almost whispering. When DeCicco mentioned the name. he was scared to death. - Bullshit! - Go ahead, Barry, what? Boffano is the boss. They work for him. - I think Annie has a point here. - Again. They've got all of these deals. Cali. the Calabrians... - The government of... - Curacao. They've got Jamaican runners. There's this huge web. One guy is sitting in the middle scheming this whole thing. - You think that's Boffano? - Maybe the Teacher advises him. The Teacher said he'd dig a tunnel to Riggio's house and kill him. Boffano gave his okay. "Kill that cocksucker." Suppose I said I was going to kill this guy, and you said "okay". - Does that make you a murderer? - You want to let the greaseball go? I really don't care for the term greaseball. How much goddamn evidence do you people want? - It isn't what we want... - Evidence beyond reasonable doubt. - What the hell is reasonable? - Just use common sense. Does that mean that anything is possible? - Can I finish? - You're not saying anything. So what are you thinking? I'm thinking that these people are scum. and I... You know what? I don't care any more. I'm tired. Reasonable doubt. I don't understand the evidence, but I know a kid got killed. A little boy. And if we set this guy free, I know what he's going to do. He'll go right back to selling drugs and hurting more people. I don't need evidence for that. I know it. That's not what the evidence says. The Teacher ordered the killing, not Buffano. - Do you have a child? - What does that have to do with it? It has everything to do with it. I have a boy, Laura. I worry about him. I know you're thinking that we've got to protect the children. There is all this chaos, and no way to get away from it. But the law says that if they don't prove that Boffano is guilty, - - then we have to set him free. even though we hate it. Just pray you get him next time. But if you twist the law even a little, - - then the law loses whatever power it's got. Then my child is in even more danger than before. And so are your grandchildren. Do you find the defendant guilty or not guilty? On both counts we find the defendant not guilty. The prisoner is released. This court is adjourned. Justice! You can't have none of him he's our Louie sorry Mr. D.A. but he's just wrong for you. Welcome home. Louie! We tipped the scales on our side. This is to the trial being over. And to your friend being home. Drink up. I got a new boyfriend. He's a cool guy. He takes pictures. Travels around the world. I'm just having so much fun! - You guys are fabulous! - I don't feel like celebrating. Congratulations, Louie. I wasn't concerned. Not for a minute! I swear, if I'm lying, may God strike me dead on this spot. Come here. - Congratulations, Louie. - Wonderful. You know that juror lady... I didn't like how she looked at me. She made me a little uncomfortable. She's afraid of you, Louie. She's not gonna be a problem. No problem? Is everything "no problem" to you? You said that with Sal Riggio, and then some kid got killed. Next, my father's on trial. Made guys can whack each other, but you killed a kid. The state's after my family because you killed a kid! My son... What are you gonna do? He worries about me. He thinks you're a psycho. He certainly loves his father. - Go ahead. - Give me the money. You're sure about this woman? Don't worry about it. No problem. I've got my eye on her. Miss Laird, get up quietly, speak to no one, and come with me. - You have $12.000 in the bank. - I sold some art work. Good for you, but we don't really care how you got it. We don't think you did this for the money. You were scared. They're still scaring you, but now it's time to stop being scared. - Let us help you. - How would you do that? If you testify for us, we'll put you somewhere safe. - You and your boy. - And then what? The mob aren't what they used to be. They don't often kill civilians. - Now can I go? - Not yet. - My son gets home soon. - Have the kid picked up. No, you stay away! You put me in danger. - In danger? From what? - From the man in the moon. Suppose the press heard that you were helping us? "Juror Brings Tampering Charges Against Buffano." A great story. - Do this and they'll kill my child. - No, not if you help us. They always threaten, but they don't do squat. Who else is gonna protect you? - I need time to think about this. - How much time? Just a day or two, but keep away from us. You watch me. but don't you let anybody know. I'll give you 48 hours. When you're ready, dial this number. You can trust us. Paul! I had a really shitty day. Let's see what we can do about that. - Give me another one. - That's a bad idea. I'm a doctor. I know what I'm doing. I want you to do something for me. What else could I possibly do for you? I want you to take these. - What are they? - Secobarbital and amobarbital... ...and stuff like that. You don't have to take them for me. I want you to do it for Oliver. - Who are you? - Haven't you figured that out yet? I'm Annie's friend. You told Annie to go and see that judge. You put Oliver at risk. The boy you care so much about. You wanted to be the big heroine. Now I'm going to give you a chance to be a real heroine. This is Oliver's only chance. I care about him just as much as you do... ...but I will kill him. I told Annie what would happen if she betrayed us. I am a man of my word. The way of power is the unvarying way. Now the police are with Annie. She has to taste grief. Save Oliver. Just a little inoculation... ...just to make sure she stays afraid. Take it! Take it. Drink. No one at the hospital could believe she'd kill herself... No one at the hospital could believe she'd kill herself... She's gone. Maybe the Feds have her in a safe house. She cleared out her bank accounts and she's gone. - She's never going to betray us. - She hates our fucking guts. - She needs some time to be alone. - I'm sick of that bullshit! - How the fuck do you know that? - Her friend died last night. - Who died? - The doctor. Annie and her child are in great danger. I will do everything that I can to protect them. What don't you understand? I could explain it to you. I don't need your explanations. - Miss Emma Faldo? - Yes. John Slivey. Your cousin Annie was working for me. She gave me your number. I have a pay check for her. - I don't know where she is. - You don't? That's too bad. Anybody else in the family who might know how to reach her? It's easy to lose touch... Gracias. Two Americans. What a surprise! - Uncle Boone. - Look at you. You guys are gonna love it here. I'll take you to the Mayan altar. I wish I had more time. When you live here, all you have is time. I have to go back. I need you to take care of Oliver. - You have to. there's no one else. - I'm not letting you go back. You take care of Oliver or you send him home with me to be killed. I'm asking you to take care of Oliver. I know what I'm asking. I know it's too much. But I've got nobody else to go to. - You're my oldest friend. - Why do you want to go back? I have to. - She came back. - She what? She's back. She wants to meet you. Tomorrow, one o'clock. - I'm here. - Why the fuck would she come back? She had to come back. She took her child to safety. A little village in Guatemala. Some place I could never find them. And she had to come back. Everything we've been through is like a marriage, Annie and I. She couldn't let it go. - It's too dangerous. - He'll know you're wired. - He'll pat you down. - He would never touch me. - He likes to be a gentleman. - You'll be in an unsafe situation. And you think I'm safe here with you? Please, just give me the wire! I'll get you Boffano. You can lock him up for the rest of his life. You can put them all away. Eddie, don't say a word. Drive around for half an hour. - What do you think of them? - My guardians? They're clueless. They irritate me. What irritates me most is their weakness. Forgive them. Their hearts are fine and they do love you. Don't you talk to me about love and forgiveness. You bastard! I hate you. I would kill you if I could. What's the lesson today, Teacher? How terror is doing me good? How strong it's going to make me? Or is it how your love will save my child? Don't you smile at me. Don't you even look at me. You want to know what I hate most? I hate that you were right. - I am stronger. - Annie... Is that all that you feel? Stop. Just stop. Listen. I went back to my studio and looked at my old work. It seemed so restrained. Smothered. No fire. No guts. Just how my life has always been. Smother the passion. Anything that you're frightened of... ...lock it out. I don't want to live like that any more. I don't want any more weakness. This is what I don't understand. You have all this strength. - But you work for Boffano, that... - Goon. - He's your friend. - Boffano doesn't have any friends. He's a monster. He commands some respect... but not for long. - People are growing tired of him. - Are you gonna get rid of him? We'll discard him. but for now we keep him as a figurehead. Let him be a mountain. I'll be a ravine. God. I'd like to have a place like this some day. A farmhouse. wood floors. A child playing in the yard. A child like Oliver. And after that. I want nothing but love. Do you think I have the power to share love. Annie? I'm sorry that you hate me... ...because I do love you. What the hell were you doing? We got nothing. The Teacher just never showed up. - He knew something was going on. - How? - You figure it out. I'm going home. - We're not done yet, Miss Laird. If you want anything else out of me tonight, arrest me. Annie! - Don't call me Annie. - Miss Laird! Who the hell is this? Stop. - Stop, I said! - It's okay, I know her. Mr. Boffano, I need to talk to you. What can I do for you? - Do you recognize me? - Sure, you're the juror lady. - What do you want? - I have something to show you. - You've got something for me? - A gift. I give you a gift and you leave me and my family alone. Of course. I would never hurt your family nor you. Swear it. Louie. and I'll give you your gift. - I'm not interested in your gift. - Yes, you are. Easy. She's got something you've got to hear. Come here. Boffano doesn't have any friends. He's a monster. He commands some respect... but not for long. My colleagues from Cali are growing tired of him. Did you enjoy that? Would you like to hear more? - When did you tape this? - Yesterday, I wired myself. Let me have it. I swear, I'm out of your life. Let me have it. Don't waste any time. - What are you doing here? - Louie wants a meet. - When? - Today. Six o'clock. Meetings are so risky. Can't you just tell him to relax? Yeah. sure... No, he says it's important. Why all this urgency? It's about Annie. He says he can't trust her. He wants her taken out. - Do you think he's right? - Nobody gives a shit what I think. You do seem to have developed a certain fondness for her. That's history. This is business, right? - Yeah. - Fine. Six o'clock, right? Normally they call him San Simon and treat him with great respect. But tomorrow they call him by his real name: Judas. They take him to that tree and they hang him... - What's wrong? - When's she coming back? - Dr. Boone. - Just one second. Oliver, she left you here because she loves you, okay? Go and have some fun. I'll catch up with you. I don't think we have to worry about that. - What's in the case? - Open it up. I'll get back to you. Vincent, I'm glad you came. What's this? I want you to take your money back. Things got a little complicated, so the money's yours. Let's walk. We need to talk. More than ten years we've been working together. You know what? I know nothing about what makes you tick. In all those ten years, I don't know nothing about you. Until this juror woman... This morning, to my mother's grave, she comes... - Annie came to see you? - You've been saying ugly things. She says you called me a motherfucking monster. It's on tape. The woman you've gone soft over, the love of your life... She wants you dead. You said you were gonna discard me. Now look who gets discarded. Get it done. - Everybody said you were a genius. - Take a look at your father. You're fucking crazy! Bada-bing! - Eddie? - No, but he's right here. I should be angry with you, but I'm not. I know this has been hard for you. I did things to protect you and Oliver. You didn't grasp that. You try to protect your child. You take Oliver down to Guatemala. And you try to destroy me. But that is not going to happen. Remember what I told you? "Trust me, because if you betray me Oliver will suffer!" Remember? I begged you to believe me. I can't trust you. Mistrust and betrayal are rooted in your character. Oliver is going to die in the morning. There's no way to stop that. We can only witness. Enjoy your flight, Mr. Wordham. - Here's my ticket. - You've just missed this flight. - My son is dying! - I'm sorry. There's another flight to Guatemala via Houston. Gate 126. - Are there no cars? - No. - Do you speak English? - Yes, my name's Daniel. Can I hire you? - I'll give you a ride. - It will be a long journey. A car? - I've got to have a car. - We have no cars. - It will be expensive. - Here. Just get me there! I'm looking for an American. His name's Oliver. Where is he? Oliver? What is this, a fucking zoo? Get back, Boone, right now. Get Oliver out of here! Annie, you really are astonishing. You won over the jury. Then you set me up with Boffano. - Now you've chartered a plane. - Yeah, with your money. You're right, Annie. You have to kill me. I see that now. It has to be that way. If you shoot me... ...then you and I will be bonded forever. No, you won't! Oliver... Mom! I love you.
