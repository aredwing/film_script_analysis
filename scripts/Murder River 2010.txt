Bloody Innocence Samduk, Jeollabuk-do 1985 Myung-hee went to Seoul to be a factory girl. - Really? - Yes. - When? - The day before yesterday. The best time for mating is they come into heat. And their gestation period is 114 days, which is 3 months, 3 weeks and 3 days. This will be on test for sure. Yes. No matter how easy it is a stupid senior of yours wrote down 3 years, 3months and 3 weeks. If they're pregnant for 3 years they can't do it for 3 years. Right? So don't you ever forget. It's 3 months, 3 weeks and 3 days. I can't believe that Myung-hee left. What? I said she went to Seoul. How do you know that, dumb ass? It's been two days since she ran away. She's not that kind of a girl. You're right. She's too pretty to work in a factory. - Then where is she? - She must have gone to a bar. Hey, shut up! I was just wondering. Me too. Did Myung-hee tell you where she was going? I was not that close to her as you know. Right. I'm sure she's fine. Yeah, she's a nice girl. Seung-Ho? Yeah? I can't go to your place today. Anything? This one. Shit, she's only a girl. Did he really have to do this? Son of a bitch. We have to line up based on our grades? You can go now. What the fuck? Pluck it already! I knew it, fucker. Go over there. Name? - Well done. Now get out. Hurry up, you motherfuckers! - What did they ask? - Don't know. - What should I say? What are you doing? Come on in! What the hell? I said hurry up. Pigs can mate when 10 month old, and students are like It sounds a bit vulgar. What? You think 9th graders can... you think they can have sex, right? What I meant was... You meant that Myung-hee was old enough to do it, right? No, that's not... She didn't take my class. What did you do that night? What? What's a 10 month old pig having sex got to with her death? Who suggested going to Jeonju? What? To watch 'The Deep Blue Night'? Sun-ja said that? Come here. You don't get to ask. You only answer, okay? These cheeky little monkeys. Why did you ask her to watch the movie that minors can't? We just... Okay, keep talking. We just asked knowing that Myung-hee wouldn't go anyway. Why? Because of Dong-sik. That's why you did something to her? No, that's not it. Keep talking. He had kept his feelings for her himself so we decided to do something - because we got so frustrated. - What? She doesn't like going to the movies. Who do you think you are? But that annoying Sun-ja said that she doesn't like going to the movies. And that was it. I don't like movies, either. Did you like Myung-hee? Were you with her that day? You were with her. Answer me, bastard. What did you do that night? This is a real tough cookie. Talk to me. Just say it. We ask her to come to see us at 6pm tomorrow. To two different places? And then? If she comes to you I'll give up, but if she comes to me... I'll give up? Dong-sik What? When I become a big shot I wouldn't just stand there and do nothing when things are unfair. Right, you're the best student after all. Yes, I am. Yeah, please let me take advantage of you. Let's meet at the bank at 7pm. Seung-ho Yeah, this is mine. Then why? What? Why this was found near the body, you fucker? Because I lent it to her. Where? At school. What about you? What about me? What umbrella did you take? I just took my bicycle without one. Why did you have to be a gentleman? Did you like her? Detective, don't talk nonsense and just do you job. What the fuck? Detective Kang, stop it! He's the class president and the hope of our town. Christ! Are you all right? Oh... You bastard! Is this yours or someone else's? I guess it's from our house. You guess it's from your house? I really don't know. Everyone at school saw me carrying a black one. But you went out with this at night again, right? I was at home. Then why this was found at the scene? Three of you were together? Okay. What did you do then? If you don't answer quickly you'll end up in prison together. We sniffed it. What? I said we sniffed it. What did you sniff? What do you mean, you bastard? Jesus, the glue. We sniffed glue. Let's call it off. You mean don't go there? Young-kyu Moon Did you tell them? Tell them what? That we had a bet. My bad. You said every house was on the map. I'm so sorry. I totally forgot. I forgot the house because the owner had died. How did he die? I think it was 2 years ago. He was driving a cultivator and fell down the cliff right over there. But the field's being watered and taken care of. Well, that's because... I remember now. This is Dong-sik's big brother. He comes and goes to help whenever he has time. That motherfucker. Hello? Is anybody home? Who is it? Come here! Get in. Fucking bastard, why did you kill her? No, you didn't?

Hey you! What the hell? That's why he look so wasted. Stop it. Kyung-sik Moon, confess. Then your sentence will be reduced. Besides, you were in a mental hospital. Okay? Let's talk. Open your mouth, motherfucker. Don't you hear me? Open your fucking mouth! Don't leave any marks. Open your mouth, asshole! You really have to go? Your brother didn't confess after all. Myung-hee would be still alive if we didn't bet that day. I'm going to move on. Dong-sik! Bye. You'll never see me here again. Jeonju, 1988 Let's go to eat! Seung-ho! Dong-sik? Long time no see. What's this, a palm or concrete? Spent 3 years on fishing boats. I see. Why don't we go to eat something? Eat? There's a great restaurant. Let's get some drinks. Drinks? Sure, why not? Then should we get some draft beer? Jesus. Dong-sik! They check attendance after dinner. This is Seung-ho's class? Yes, it is. Where's the attendance book? In the office... I'll get it.

She was so good to me. Marry her when you become an attorney or a judge. You have no idea how popular she was. Have you visited your brother? Seung-ho, you see... Damn it. Let's drink till death!

It sounds so corny. But it's a nice place. No, why don't we go to some bar and get cold beer. But I want some milk. Fresh milk. What? You know each other? Since when you're a regular? You're such a naughty man. Hey, come on in. Come on. You liked Myung-hee, right? But don't hate my big brother too much. Me, neither. I heard that he insisted till the end that he didn't do it. Who believes someone with a mental disease? Don't hate Dong-sik, either. Why would I hate him? Right, you're friends. Is it because I'm a bar girl? No, that's not it. Hey, stop right there! Let me go! Don't move, asshole! Let me see. You were the class president of Samduk Middle School. You lent Myung-hee your umbrella on the day she died. How come you don't remember, smart ass? Now you're the head of Worker Student Solidarity. You're keen on leading, don't you? You'd be doing some important shit one day. What's this? Hey you! You don't give a damn, do you? Back to where you were! Back to where you were! When I first came, I was standing at the door for 3 days. I guess we're living in a better world now. You must be a student. I started college in 1970.

He said she was pretty. So you slept with her? I think he was a fucking nerd. You're the one who failed to rape a middle aged woman. Right? Then what fucker did she end up with? She died. I'll kill you if you're making things up. Hey you! Throw it away quickly. Run. Kyung-sik? Seung-ho? They're from the same town. That's funny. A lifer for rape and a student activist. Seung-ho's cell chief is also from Samduk. It's like a reunion for Samduk people. That's right. Things are going well for you? Kyung-sik, here's a newcomer. I've never expected to see you. What did you do to Myung-hee? You think so, too? You mean you didn't do it? Who's gonna believe me? Are you sure? You really didn't do it? Visitor: Dong-sik Moon How did you know that I'm here? You can't hide from me. Everyone in Samduk knows that. Really? It is sort of a school, isn't it? You still sail? Only when I'm out of money. Did you see your brother? I don't have a brother.

He's fucking crazy. Beat him to death! Kill him! Stop! You go to a solitary cell when you fight at lunch hour. Damn... I can't even eat properly. Back to where you were. Lunatics like him should be in a mental hospital. fine for 2 years. I got set up by the police. Seung-ho, I didn't like her to be cold. I just wanted to cover her with a blanket. But they said she was removed first. She was smiling at me. I'm so sorry, Seung-ho. No, I'm sorry to Dong-sik. I don't know whom I should say sorry to. I really didn't know that Dong-sik liked her. Seung-ho, Seung-ho! Seung-ho! Seung-ho! Seung-ho! Hey, pull it! Keep up with me. For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son. You are my Gods and I will give you thanks.

Contact the family. Yes, sir. Seung-ho. Please take care of Dong-sik. But he disappears without a word. You were always together back then. I know. It's so strange. I used to... hate my big brother. But it's sad. Even though he was a murderer and... You're... not getting married? I don't know. Fuck, fuck! I was proud when I was with you. You were good looking, a good student, and from a good family. But why did you like someone like me? Because we were similar. You know what? What? We shouldn't meet any more. Crazy bastard. How did he die? I'm just curious. That's all. He put cyanide into milk. Boshin-dong, Dongducheon 1997 Umbrella! Umbrella! Umbrella! It's rainy David Give me yellow one! Yellow my ass. Speak Korean!
