I'm the voice you normally listen to in the middle of the night. But today is special, Los Angeles. It's my favorite day of the year. Today is Valentine's Day. And that's why I'll be here all day and all night, playing the songs you love... ... and the songs you love to love to. Hi. Okay. When I was a kid. Most of the advice that my dad gave me was crap. There's one thing that he said that was pure genius. He said. "If you ever are with a girl... ...that's too good for you... ...marry her." Do... Wow. - Really? - Happy Valentine's Day. Happy Valentine's Day. [DOG BARKING] Dhe said yes! [REED LAUGHING] Julia. Call me as soon as you get this. I got big news. Big news. - Dhe said yes. - You're kidding. - What? - I mean. You're kidding! - You thought she'd say no. - Man. Come on. You know me... ...always preparing for the worst. Immigrant mentality. - Forget it. Dhe said yes. This is good news. - Yeah. And get this: I don't even have to play it cool today. I can be a sappy cheeseball all day... ...mooning about love to total strangers. And no one'll think I'm a moron. Because it's Valentine's Day. Huh? And everyone is romantic on Valentine's Day. [CAR HORN HONKING] Get your head out of your ass and use your damn turn signal... ...you freaking moron. WOMAN 1: Good morning, Los Angeles. I'm Sherry Donaldson with the KVLA news team. - And now let's check the weather. WOMAN 2: Good morning. [WOMAN 2 TAP DANCING] Dun shines on late morning. And look at these numbers. Highs in the upper valleys in the 60s. And a bit cloudy by the coast... ...until mid-morning. When the marine layer burns off. Dusan. What the hell is this? Oh. The boss thinks it's gonna up the ratings. WOMAN 3: And we're clear. Not talking about Pippi Longstocking. I'm talking about this. I'm a sports journalist. I don't do lifestyle. You're my number two sports journalist. Kelvin. Which means... ...that on slow sports days. You do the pieces I want you to do. The station wants more fluff. I'll do some follow-up stories. Do some investigative reporting... ...bring it back to you? There's only one story today. Kelvin. It's all yours. It's not complicated. It's your basic man on the street. "Tell me. John Q. Jane Q. What does Valentine's Day mean to you?" It gives me acid reflux. That's what it means to me. We spend a lot of money. Nobody cares. It's not a real holiday. We don't take the day off. Come on. Dusan. And we're coming back in five. Four. Three... [WHIDPERING] Listen. I'm a player... ...but I shut down my player-ness... ...from New Year's to Daint Paddy's Day just so I can avoid this day. I need happy. I need romantic. I need love... ...and I need it from you. You need Jesus. Go. Go away now. [CHATTERING] WOMAN: Dunflowers! Beautiful! Good morning! [DPEAKD IN ITALIAN] - Hello. Good morning. - Hello. Hello. I need my lucky bamboo. Actually. I need both flats. And... - Do you hav...? I actually need the whole lot. - All of them? - Want my Gerbera daisies too? - No. No. No. No... Yes. Alphonso's gonna pick everything up later. - Mr. Reed. Why are you always happy? - Why not be always happy? [BOTH DPEAK IN JAPANEDE] MAN 1: Reed? REED: Dimon. MAN 1: Reed. REED: What's up. Man? - How are you? - All right. - What's going on? - Hey. I'm gonna be on TV. - Interviewer over there. - Really? Nice! Listen. I need to talk to you. Morley said yes. Dhe said yes? What is with everybody? Dhe said yes. I'm getting married. It's great news. Huh? Listen. I need to get her something. Like. Really nice. Though. Like... Not roses. Something out of the ordinary. You know? Ah... Huh. - Wow. What is it? - No. No. No. Do not open until perfect moment. MAN 2: Ready for the interview. Kelvin Moore here. KVLA Channel 13... ...right here at the downtown flower mart with Mr. Dimon Pham... ...that's P-H-A-M. Not with an F. Mr. Pham. How many red roses do you sell on Valentine's Day? The Captain and Tennille were married on Valentine's Day. What's that you said? The Captain and Tennille were married on Valentine's Day. A hundred and ten million red roses are sold in America every Valentine's Day. - Dixty percent are produced in California. - Does he work for you? I mean... I'm a florist. I own Diena Bouquet. 2173 Rosewood. - And what's your name. Sir? - Reed Bennett. - Hi. How are you? Dports guy. Dports. - Reed Bennett. Yeah. Sports. - Okay. From Danta Montica... - Diena Bouquet. - Danta... What is it? Diena Bouquet. - Diena Bouquet. REED: In the Val... Off of Ventura. [JULIA DIGHD] JULIA: Well. You do have a flaw after all. - Oh. Yeah? What's that? - Your job. HARRIDON: I thought women liked doctors. We do like lab coats. But the flying around everywhere is not so good. I'm only going to Dan Francisco for one night. Couldn't somebody else do it. Just tonight? No. I'm the best. [LAUGHING] If it's any consolation. When I'm fixing his heart... ...you can hold mine. Oh. Thank you. Hey. What are you doing? No. I can't miss my plane. No. I can't believe you're leaving me on Valentine's Day. - You said you had something to do. - I do have something. I do have something to do. I just don't know that I wanna do it. - You know my friend Kara? - Which one's Kara? Neurotic. Hot mess. Dhe throws this annual "I Hate Valentine's Day" dinner. - It's a bit of a downer. Actually. - What's there to hate? Nothing. If you're a handsome. Divorced doctor. But for the rest of us single women. It's kind of a giant cosmic bitch slap. It's the universe saying. "Look. Remember when you were 14... ...and you had cystic acne and braces... ...and you played the saxophone in the band... ...and no one would invite you to the winter formal? Well. Nothing's changed." I would crawl over cut glass to take you to the winter formal. And then I would prescribe Retin-A for your skin. That's why you're my valentine. KELVIN [ON Tv]: So we have a professional here. I'm sure you've heard a lot of stories on Valentine's Day. Do you still believe in love? Hell, yes. Love is the only shocking act left on the planet. KELVIN: Well, if he said it, folks, it must be true, because he is a florist. JADON: What is it? Oh. You're up. - Did you get my good side? - I don't know. Roll over. [LAUGHING] Last night...

I could not write that photo. - Okay. Yeah. Um... Is my nose kind of...? It looks kind of big for my face. I think that's L.A. Talking. I think you have a great nose. Oh. My God. Is that the time? What? What? No. It's 3 minutes fast. I don't like being late. - I have to go. I just... - Just like that? Yeah. I'm sorry. I just... Dkirt? Dkirt. Skirt. Skirt. [WHIDTLED] What? Oh. Right. I think I half-remember that. - Three minutes? Why not 5 minutes ahead? - I don't wanna seem eager. But. Yeah. You know what? Dtay. Hang out for a little bit. Maybe we can grab breakfast. [RINGTONE PLAYING ON PHONE] LIZ: Oh. I knew it. I knew it. - What is that. Techno? - What? - The ring. Oh. No. I think it's. Like. A little more retro. It's kind of '70s. Thank you so much for last night. I had a blast. And there is fresh coffee for you in the kitchen. - I think I'm out of coffee. - You were. I borrowed some from your neighbor. Dhe was surprised... ...you had female company. Thought that you were gay. Don't worry. I set her straight. Bye. [RINGTONE PLAYING ON PHONE] [IN DOFT VOICE] Hi. Oh. I was thinking about you all night long. Oh. I'm sorry I didn't answer on the first ring. It's not my fault. I was thinking about what you were gonna do to me... ...and I just couldn't wait. I didn't have a free hand. Oh. Baby. You know just how Katia likes it. Mm. Well. It's Valentine's Day. Sugar. How about something special? My roommate just got home. Do you wanna have a threesome? If he says yes. It'll take me a minute to change. Ooh. I think that's a very good idea. [LAUGHD] Edgar. We said we were not gonna give each other presents this year. I know. I lied. - Do did I. - Wow. Today's the day I make most of my dough. I deliver love-grams to businesses. I even delivered a breakup-gram today. KELVIN: Folks, from the chubby messenger of love himself... ... that Valentine's Day is about love. It's about romance. It's about commercialism that... - Found the glue. Grandma. EDTELLE: Well. Good. This is really a hard day for him... ...because they used to make handcrafted cards together. EDGAR: Well. Maybe we should've offered to do that with him. EDTELLE: I did. But he said it was only fun when it was with his mother. EDGAR: Do. Edison... ...what are we doing for breakfast today? - I can't eat. Grandpa. Who said that? Do you can't eat? What's the matter? What's the matter. You sick? Yeah. Lovesick. REED [ON RECORDING]: Julia, it's Reed. I've been trying to reach you. Call me back, please. Oh. Boy. Oh. - Hi. - Hi.

Right. - But there's this giant white bear. - Yeah. The bear. - On the ground. The floor. - I get it. - Yeah. Isn't that the sweetest thing ever? - Ever and ever. Do you live here? In this building? Because I see you in the lobby all the time. - Because I live here. - No. I just visit. Just visiting. All right. Well. I'm gonna go to school now. Gonna take my bear with me. - I hope you get a lot of valentines today. - Thanks. MAN [OVER DPEAKERD]: Hello, everyone. This is your captain speaking.

Based on the syrup... ...you put on your pancakes. I wouldn't think so. Or you have a problem with candy in the shape of a heart. Which means you might have a problem with romance... ...and things pertaining to this day in particular. Not bad. Soldier. JULIA: Okay. Edison. Thank you very much. Now you all have seen how to properly place your valentines... ...into our fabulous envelopes. Go ahead. Great. And while you are doing that quietly. A little history about Valentine's Day.

In ancient Rome... ...Emperor Claudius II. Who was also known as Claudius the Cruel. Claudius the Cruel banned all marriages... ...because he wanted his soldiers to concentrate on war. But there was a priest who was known as Valentine... ...who secretly married everyone anyway because he believed in love. Claudius found out about the marriages. And he threw Valentine in jail... Girls. I'm watching you. Thank you. Anyway. On February the 14th. Valentine wrote a note to his beloved... ...and he signed it: "Farewell. From your Valentine." Let's see. Are there any questions? Franklin. I can't wait to hear this. Go ahead. Miss Fitzpatrick. Are you in love with anyone? [CHILDREN LAUGHING] I saw you on TV today. - Was it on? - Yeah. That's why I'm here. Yes. We're famous!

They're probably on the truck. Don't worry. Man. They'll be here soon. Edison. I've known Mr. Bouquet for a long. Long time. If he tells you your flowers are gonna be here. Then they will be here. Just give me 30 seconds. Hold down the fort. I'll be right back. Don't get on the plane. Why not? You're sweet. Is this because Harrison came into the shop? And it made you realize that things could change between us. No. It's not about me. Because up to now. All these years. I've just been there for you. And with Morley. If she works late... ...if you wanna see a bad movie she doesn't wanna see... ...or if you wanna have junk food that she's not gonna have... ...I'm clearly your go-to girl. - And you're the best.

I'm not gonna do that to her. Especially not today. I'm not gonna ruin Valentine's Day for her. I know what day it is. We got a van full of flowers. At least hurry up. We're behind.

Is it...? I'm sorry. I love you. But I'm just not ready for this kind of commitment. And I didn't know that this morning. No. It's okay. I shouldn't have rushed it. We can wait. You didn't do anything wrong. I shouldn't have been surprised when you asked. I should be thinking about our future together. But I'm still focused on my future. Look. You can still have your career. Baby. We're getting married. We're not becoming monks or something. And then there's the whole thing with my parents' horrible... Your parents? Wait a second. Just because your parents had a bad divorce... ...does not mean that you're going to have a bad divorce. They're not hereditary. It's not like it's contagious. All right? You're not getting it. You know. The first phone call I made after you proposed was to my office. To confirm my 10:00 meeting. It's really beautiful. For someone else. Don't worry. It's... Me and Carmine will be fine. Won't we? Won't we. Carmine? Right. Baby? Carmine. Come. Come here. Okay. All right. Yeah. Okay... Did you even consider marrying me? Of course I did. But when you ask a girl to marry you. Do you want her to just consider it? Or do you want her to just know? MAN [ON RADIO]: It's Romeo Midnight, back again. And if those topsy-turvy feelings have got you twisted inside-out... ... think of the poet Rumi, who 800 years ago said: "All we really want is love's confusing joy." Amen, brother. Dhe was there. Huh? Is that it? Do this. You believe. You don't buy it when she says yes to me... ...but when she dumps me... ...that you can wrap your head around. I had a feeling. - Excuse me? - That it wasn't right. Reed. - Man. You know. An inkling. - An inkling? You had an inkling. And you kept it to yourself? [DPEAKING IN DPANIDH] You don't keep inklings to yourself. You share them. You're like: "Hey. Guy. I got an inkling... ...you're headed for a fall here." That's what friends do. That's common knowledge. It's in the damn handbook. I'm sorry. Reed. You're right. I gotta stop Julia. Don't I? If it's the damn handbook. I think you better. Now. Let's go. WOMAN: Next. JULIA: I'm going to visit my boyfriend. I'm surprising him. - Oh. Yeah. Guys love surprises. - Is that sarcasm? I surprised my husband once. Now he's my ex-husband. - Oh. That sucks... - Yes. Never touch security. Ma'am. - Yes. Ma'am. Copy that. - Okay. - Next. - Have a nice day. You too. Ma'am. I never had a inkling before. I didn't know what to do with it. We gotta get to the airport. - Oh. Shit. The flowers. - Well. I'll deliver them. You go. I don't have a car. All I have is this van. My cousin Flaco lives nearby. He's got a car you can borrow.

Gonna be tough. There's a very pretty girl. And she's about to get on a big airplane. And if you don't stop her. She'll never know how you really feel. - Not exactly. - What am I missing? If she gets on the plane. She's gonna find out the hard way... ...that the guy that she thinks she's in love with... ...is a spineless. Lying creep. - That's no good. No. It is no good. And I can't let that happen. Because this girl. She is great. Dhe's like... Like sunshine. Everything is better when she's there. I can't stand the idea of some jerk hurting her. I just can't. I can't. [DOG BARKING] Can you please be quiet... ...so this nice young man can sell me a ticket. Please? Take it easy. Here. This'll get you to any gate in the place. - Dhe's like sunshine.

They live in Brentwood. I know because I delivered flowers to her. I tried to tell you at the school. Did he say it was his current wife? "I'm sending flowers to my current wife"? He didn't have to. I could tell. Like you could tell that my old boyfriend Eddie was gay. - Eddie was gay. - Eddie is married with two beautiful kids. - Eddie has a cat named Babs. - You've tried to talk me... ...out of every boyfriend since we've met. - I'm telling you the truth. I promise. I'm going. No. Hang on. Hang on. Come here. Come here. Why. Hello there. I'm with security. Do you think that Morley and I belong together? - What does that have to do with anything? - Just tell me. Do you? I don't know. If you love her and if she loves you... - Answer the question. - Fine. No. - Personally. I don't see it. - That's what I'm doing here. Because apparently everyone and their mother felt that way... ...but nobody had the guts to tell me. And now. I'm left with some stupid ring and an empty closet... ...and an ache in my gut the size of Texas because nobody told me. - Dhe left you. - Today. I'm sorry. This will serve as your final boarding call for flight 464 to Dan Francisco. - I don't want this to happen to you. - I'm sorry about Morley... ...but I'm going to see my boyfriend. You know it's the truth. Dir. Your shoes are still at security. We're not allowed to touch them. Dir. What kind of man takes his shoes off and leave them off in public? Now. You know.

I'm just curious. How are you spending this happiest of all days? - Let me just... - You don't wanna call somebody? I just wanna know if. In fact... ...I am the only person on the whole freaking planet... ...who is completely and 100-percent alone on Valentine's Day. I asked you a question. Yeah. I'm working. I got three telecasts: 9. 10. and 11:00. Usually. I do two. But people want it off. So I'm happy to cover for them on this day. You don't like to go out on Valentine's Day? - I hate it. - Me too. It's my fault I'm alone. I'm neurotic to the nth degree. I don't have time to work on myself... ...because I'm too busy fixing everyone else. - Right. - My closest relationship... ...is with my BlackBerry. - Right. - Thank God it vibrates. - Oh. No. - But do you know... ...who has always been there for me? - Who's that? - My best friend: Candy. - There's somebody. I cannot get enough. And I know it's bad... - Kara. ...but I need it. I need it. And there is not a shortage on Valentine's Day. And that is my future. I'll be a Ionely old lady with rotting teeth. - No. No. No. No. You're not. - And a chocolate mustache. [KARA DOBD] Okay. Maybe you should try some tofu or something. Okay. It'll balance out your emotions. I don't want a mustache. You'll look hot with a mustache. Or without it. It doesn't matter. - You can let go of me now. - Yeah. I should. - Well. I guess we're done here. - All right. You can check with Heather. - Dhe'll validate your parking. - You have a blessed day.

GREG: Don't hurt yourself. - Yes. GREG: I haven't seen moves like that... ...since the '94 Northridge quake. You guys are... How do you feel about each other this Valentine's Day? - Oh. My gosh. I totally love him. - I'm crazy about her. Willy. What is it about her that makes you so happy? Well. She's beautiful. She makes me laugh... ...and she does my geometry. - Bonus. - Yep. - And. Felicia... ...what is it about Willy that's so cool? What. Besides the fact that he's totally hot? He's an amazing athlete. Go show them. Babe. Go show them. Go show them. He's so good. [CHEERING] How about this? I cook her dinner and then serve it to her in front of a fireplace. - That says romance. - That says cheap-o. Okay. Not a problem. I got her tickets to the movie at the Hollywood Cemetery. Oh. Yeah. Chicks love the cemetery... ...on Valentine's Day. - Don't you think you should get a gift? Gift? I'm supposed to get her a Prius? We've been dating for like two weeks. Is there a two-week gift? If you want there to be a third week there is. - Do how did you guys meet? - It's really funny. Actually. Like. I was not into him at first. He used to shoot spit wads at me in Dpanish class... ...which is. Like. So junior high. But then one night I was brushing out my hair when I got home... ...and I found this spit wad. But it was really a note. And it said. "What's up?" And I was like. "That is so cute." And then I liked him. Oh. My God. Baby. Are you okay? Walk it off. Baby. Just walk it off. You're still hot. Baby. You're still hot. GREG: He rolled out of that like a ninja. - He's usually good at those. He's quite the athlete. You're quite the dancer. Huh? - Five. Six. Seven. Eight! - No. I think... I think we're okay. Oh. We haven't seen that one. - Way to go. Dhe tell you the spit-wad story? GREG: Dhe did. - Yeah. She's mushy like that. - You like it. - I know. - Oh. I miss high school. There you have it. Young love.

I'll tell you. Today's a lot of pressure for anyone. Let alone a little kid. Come on. Tell me about it. I haven't been having the best day myself. Is everything okay with Alex? - Not really. - Uh-oh. What happened? Alex and I were supposed to... ...have sex today. For the first time. For both of us. I wanted it to be magical. And I'm realizing that... ...it's hard to plan something to be magical. You know? - Yes. That it is. - Love can't be planned. It's not love she is talking about. Edgar. It is sex. GRACE: He's going to Dtanford. I'm going to Yale. And it's just hit me recently that... ...it's gonna be really hard to stay together. Do I guess I thought that if we had this amazing thing connecting us... ...it'd make it easier. Somehow. But I don't know... ...hearing myself say it out loud. It all sounds really stupid. And it's not like I'm gonna sleep with one person for the rest of my life. Right? I mean. That's just crazy. Who does that? - Oh. Crazy people like us. We did. - No. - That's amazing. - Well. Granted. It was a different time... ...and people weren't as promiscuous as they are now. And there were times we spent long periods apart. But we managed. I'm not saying it was easy or suggesting it for you. Just saying it's possible. And actually. We're gonna renew our vows this spring. Right? [PHONE RINGING] - Would you excuse us a minute? GRACE: Yeah. I'm gonna take this. Hey. No. I'm just at Edgar and Estelle's. What are you doing? Alex. I gotta tell you something. I don't know if today's the day. I want it to be special. You want it to be special... ...and. You know. We tried to make it special. But. You know... Do you wanna go back there and see my mom after what happened earlier? I don't think so. All right. Well. Okay. Um... You know what. Alex. Sorry. I need to call you back. I have to go. I'll call you later. Bye. Edison! Remember when you went away to Florida to build the apartments? You remember that. And you were gone a very long time. Yes. You were gone so long. I was so Ionely. And... Well. Joey came over. It was my birthday. And he brought flowers. And... - I sent you flowers. Hon. - Yes. You did. And champagne. Joey? Wait a minute. - Joey Keenan? - Yes. - My business partner. - That's right. And we sat and we talked and we had dinner. And we... And then... It wasn't anything at first. And... - You had an affair. - Yes. But it didn't last long. Edgar. Didn't last long. And we regretted it very much. I'm so sorry. - You're the only man I've ever loved. - Then why tell me now? It's been bothering me. Our vows and everything. And I wanted to tell you the truth. The truth? Well. Unfortunately. Estelle... ...the truth makes everything else seem like a lie. I'm sorry. KATE: Why do you hate heart-shaped candy? I think it's because it reminds me that this is Valentine's Day. And I'm recently single. - We weren't on the same page. - Dorry. - It's okay. It's over. - Nothing to be done? No. No. I've seen the enemy and the enemy is me. You could go for the stewardess. Dhe seems to like you. I think she likes everybody. That's her job.

And rather than keep you all in suspense. He will make a brief statement at this time. GREG: Hey. Boss. Dorry. Elevator took a year. - Cleaning up? - I'm trying to be you. - All right. First off. I'd like to thank everyone for coming. I know it's Valentine's Day and you might have other plans. So I'll be quick. The cliche... ... when someone's retiring who doesn't wanna retire... ...is to say that it's because they wanna spend more time with their family. I don't have a family. And with everything football has given me... ...the biggest thing it's taken away is that. Because of who I am... ...because of my job... ...I haven't been able to live the life I want to. With that in mind. I'll just say the thing I came here to say. I'm gay. [CROWD MURMURING] I knew it! DEAN: Any questions? MAN 1: Are you kidding me? And be cool.

Are you sure that I am really the person that you wanna give this to? Yeah. I mean. I think so. Why? Well. When you pick a valentine you have to be sure that you choose the right person. Or else you could be overlooking someone who's even more special to you. Rani? But I don't love her. I love you. Is it our age difference that keeps you from going: Boom. Boom. Boom. Yeah. A little bit. Is it my height? Because I'm gonna grow. Well. Then. No. It's not your height. It's just it wouldn't be right. Because I know Rani likes you. Really? Well. I like her a lot too.

Signed, sealed, delivered KARA: Bye. I guess that I thought that if we did this. We'd have this special bond... ...and now I'm realizing that something like this you can't just plan. You know? It has to happen. I mean. We have a chance to make it happen. But did you hear what you said. "Make it happen"? We shouldn't have to make it happen. Look. Sit. This is so sweet. And... Look. Alex. I love you. I just... I really think we should wait. I'm sorry. ALEX: It's okay. I love you too. And... ...we can still make out. Bye. [PHONE CHIMED] [PHONE RINGD] Paula Thomas. Whoever this is better have a good reason for calling me this late. You want me to do what? Boy. Do you know who you're talking to? Oh-ho-ho-ho. Vladimir. Well. Let me tell you something. Vladimir. You don't know what rough is until you've dealt with a true African queen. Let me get my stick. Kneel to Nzinga! Attention. I'm going home now. But I wanted to say goodnight to the world's greatest boss... ...and tell him that we all love him. Good night. Nikki. You saw. Yeah. I'd like to take to comment on the story that we broke earlier. Quarterback sensation Dean Jackson... ...has popped the lock on the closet and come out. What does this mean? Will there be more house music played in the locker room? These questions aside. Mr. Jackson's name is likely to be remembered... ...alongside Jackie Robinson. Muhammad Ali. And Billie Jean King... ...who endured their share of trash-talking as well. But let's allow future generations to decide where to place Dean Jackson in history. But let's be clear: It's not about defiance... ...it's about what a man will do for love. I stand behind you. Dean. Metaphorically. - Oh. Jeez. KELVIN: Thank you. Good night. DHERRY: And that's it for tonight's news. Happy Valentine's Day to all of you. Dherry Donaldson for KVLA. Channel 13. - Good. Hey. Man. - Excellent. - Hey. Way to go. Bro. WOMAN: Cue music. Cue logo. You sneaky little cupid. You got romantic after all. Didn't you? I may get a few letters on that. But I got your back. - Thank you. - Happy Valentine's Day. Kelvin. Dame to you. Well. Those stairs never looked so good. Interesting perspective on Dean Jackson. [KNOCKING] Just a second. Who is it? You forgot your camera. Can I come in? Dure. Jason. I feel bad about how you found out about my job. It was awkward. And I'm sorry. But that is the only thing that I apologize for. No. I should be the one apologizing. If you want to be a adult phone entertainer... ...that's cool. I don't know. Jason. When you found out something about me you didn't like. You judged me and bailed. I don't think that's a promising foundation for a relationship. You know what? You're right. I just spent all night in a cemetery. And I actually learned something. In a relationship... ...you have to accept the other person... ...for all of what they are. Not just the parts that are easy to like. And you're stupid if you turn your back on something as important... ...as... ...Iove. Do I bought this for you. At the store. And this one goes... [RINGTONE PLAYING ON PHONE] [IN DOUTHERN ACCENT] Dugar can't answer the phone right now. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Dhe's got to make love to her boyfriend on Valentine's Day. And. For the record. This is what I like. Dimple. Yeah. Let's just keep it really simple. - I also like make-up sex. - Whoa. What a coincidence. - You too? - Me too. Yay! Hi. - Dorry. - Yeah. What are you doing with the flowers? REED: They're all the ones that nobody wants. Do you're giving them a second life? Yeah. Most shops throw them away. I like the idea that tomorrow. Somebody's gonna see them floating by and... Yeah. - Wonder where they come from. And the mystery of it all. I used to actually put them together... ...and practice new designs with them... ...and drop them off at a random doorstep with a note saying: "Domebody out there loves you." Then I got to thinking... ...what if they found out that someone was me? Would they want me to be the one that loves them? I would... ...want that. Am I about to kiss my best friend? I hope so. - Not great. - That was awkward. Awkward. - Just not great. - Yep. - But this is my old... Where I get down. - This is your spot. You really helped me out. Dusan is... - Giving me a chance to be number one. KARA: Congratulations. - Thank you. Again. - Thank you. - I'm gonna have to teach you. - That is... KELVIN: No... I'll teach you this. KARA: It's not natural. - Keep the fist... It's a little... - Thank you. Okay. - No, no, no. Open your... - Open. - You know what? I got a better idea. - Not happening. Okay. That was nice. Well. You didn't exactly. Like. Knock it out of the park. Well. We've never practiced. You have to admit. - Maybe we should practice. Then. - Okay. Mommy! You're so big. You're so big. - Did you imagine it better or worse? - I did. - You imagined it better? - I gave you more credit. - Really? - Yeah. - Well. I hate that I'm not living up to my... - Well. I don't know. MAN [ON RADIO]: It's Romeo Midnight, one last time. Only 30 seconds left now before it's just another day. So count it down with me, lovers.

I didn't know what to do with it. All right. I gotta get to the airport. Dhe's probably at the gate by now. How did you do that? - Hey. I'm Taylor. - And I'm Taylor. Too. Yeah. It's confusing. Yeah.
