Each home fills with joy on this grand holiday, With hearts growing warm in a magical way. The rooms are covered with wreaths. The mantel has stockings beneath. Lights twinkle and bells brightly chime. The moment's arrived, it's here, Christmas time. Three precious gifts lie under this tree. What secrets they hold, Let's look and we'll see. The first tells a story for us all to hear About laughter and family, and those we hold dear. We love Christmas so much, we want it to stay. But what if we wished it was here every day? Anchor's aweigh! Full steam ahead! Swab the deck, you... All aboard! Next stop, Funnyville. It's here. - The one - The only best day of the year. It's Christmas! Oh, boy! Just what we always wanted. - Hey, look at this. - Cool! Merry Christmas, boys. You know we have to wait for the family. Sorry, Uncle Donald. Ah, it's Christmas, and I've got a special surprise for you. But you didn't even... ...read the... card. We'll read it later. - Merry Christmas, everybody. - Indeed. Where are my boys and my kisses? I could just eat you up. Oh, Donald? Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! Aunt Daisy, catch ya later. Last one down the hill's a rotten egg... Not me! Boys! Dinner. The one thing better... ...than presents... ...is Christmas dinner. Isn't this lovely? All of us gathered for a wonderful meal. It's my favourite part of Christmas. - Turkey! - Donald, would you like to carve? Boys! Where are your manners? - This turkey is so good. - Your gravy never has lumps. We love your cooking, Aunt Daisy. Donald, they're just enjoying my dinner. Ah, phooey. I don't want any. Alright, who's for carolling? We don't wanna sing, Uncle Scrooge. We wanna play with our toys. - Bedtime, boys. - Not yet. Christmas can't be over already. Good night, boys. What a great day. We should do it more often. Yeah. Once a week should be enough. It'll be another 365 days until we get more Christmas. Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight. We wish it was Christmas every day. All aboard! Next stop, Funnyville. Boy, those guys sure like that choo-choo. They're gonna play with it again today? Let's play with our new toys. They're gone. Hey, what is this? Huh? Whoa! Didn't we open these yesterday? Are you thinking what I'm thinking? There's only one way to find out. We're gonna have to open these presents. Merry Christmas. - Uncle Donald, we did it. - It's Christmas again! It's Christmas again, Uncle Donald. Two days in a row. You boys must have been dreaming. We almost forgot about our special surprise. Where are my kisses? I could just eat you up. We should have seen that coming. Last one down the hill's a rotten egg. Again! Boys, dinner. Isn't this lovely? All of us gathered for a wonderful meal. This is my favourite part of Christmas. Turkey! Boys! Where are your manners? Donald, they're just enjoying my dinner. Good night, boys. - That was great. - Double great. Yeah. All aboard! Next stop, Funnyville. Yeah! Alright! Merry Christmas, boys. Look out, Uncle Donald. - Merry Christmas, everybody. - Merry Christmas, indeed. Where are my boys and my kisses? No, you don't. I think this is my favourite part of Christmas. Merry Christmas, boys. - Merry Christmas. - I could eat you up... ...my favourite part of Christmas. We wish you a merry Christmas All aboard! Next stop, Funnyville. You can stop Christmas now. Please! Where are my kisses? ...Funnyville. ...my favourite part... Who's for carolling? Looks like the end of the line. Until tomorrow, when it happens all over again. You're right. Yesterday's today, and today's tomorrow, and it's gonna be the same thing day in and day out... Get a grip! I'm sorry, fellas. That's OK. We know how you feel. If I see the same toys again, I'll go out of my mind. Yeah, and if I eat any more turkey, I'm gonna need new clothes. We got to do something to liven things up. Green leader to red leader. Initiate pancake intercept sequence. Roger. Donald, stop playing with the boys' presents. Where are my boys and my kisses? Right here, Aunt Gertie. Isn't this lovely? All of us gathered for a wonderful meal. It's my favourite part of Christmas. Oh! Turkey! Not the piano. Not my beloved carols. Well, we still have the tree. Let's run before Uncle Donald gets mad. We'll be outside if you need us. Donald, are you alright? "To Huey, Dewey and Louie, Christmas isn't about candy canes, holly or lights all aglow, it's about the hearts that we touch, and the care that we show." "Wishing you lots of love, Donald and Daisy." Some Christmas this turned out to be. Gee, I don't know about you guys, but I don't ever wanna do that again. Me, too. Me, three. Tomorrow, let's have the best Christmas ever. We're putting these sleds to good use. Incoming! Merry Christmas, fellas. Look, we made you breakfast. Isn't that nice? You've already opened presents. No way. We've got to wait for the family to get here. - Merry Christmas, everybody. - Indeed. Don't forget our kisses, Aunt Gertie. What are they up to? You boys are so wonderful. - That looks heavy. - Let us help you. Why, isn't that sweet? Thank you, boys. Ham! Uncle Donald, would you like to carve? Something's up for sure. Nothing better than gathering... ...for a wonderful meal. It's our most favourite part. My feelings exactly. Carols, Uncle Scrooge? Why, boys, it's like you could read my mind. What's the big idea? What are you boys up to? Donald Duck, you're spoiling a perfect Christmas. No, Uncle Donald is right. We are up to something. Merry Christmas. See, it's your dream boat! Thank you, boys. How beautiful. Some Christmas this has turned out to be. I'm just so happy. Boys? Come gimme a push. It's over! Christmas is really over. The day after Christmas. I understand, boys. You must want Christmas every day. No! Anchor's aweigh! Full steam ahead. Man overboard. So Christmas was meant to last just one day, And maybe it's better that way. /t's a time to be treasured, it can't always be here, But the feeling it gives us can last the whole year. Now this gift holds a story both wondrous and rare, About a father and a son and the love that they share. This Christmas they'll learn before the night's through, /f we care for each other, our dreams can come true. ...Oh, hear the angels sing... Come on, Maxie, at least hum a few bars. Dad, hurry up. Deck the walls with cows and caulis... The mailman comes at noon, Dad! Let's see, now. - How about an electrical recliner? - Yeah, Dad, whatever. Don't want to turn into a fancy pants. Yeah, Dad, but Santa won't get our letter if we don't leave... ...now! Hold on, Dad. We're taking a short cut. We ought to slow down before we break the sound barrier. - What?! - We're headed straight for the mall. Great idea. - Low bridge. - Really? Where? Go ahead and stop the mailman, son. I'll be right behind ya. Don't worry, I won't let you down. Excuse me. Pardon me, ma'am. Didn't mean to get fresh. Wait! There's a madman on the ornament. Sorry. Wait! Stop! You have to mail our letter to Santa. Get out of the road, kid. Do you have anything bigger? I have an empty space right here. I'll take it. My dad'll be here any minute, honest. Sorry, kid, gotta go! Special delivery for the North Pole. You really think Santa will get the letter? Sure as I stand here. Slippery. I gotta get it, I just gotta. My own one-of-a-kind, carbon fibre, torque rod, snappy flex, tip-to-tail, rail-to-rail, wood core, twin-directional snowboard! That's a mouthful. With adjustable forward and high back skid plate step-in bindings. Look at this. All nice and neat and ready for ol' Santy. Merry Christmas Eve, Pete. Why, if it ain't the goof master himself. Say, we got us some more work to do, Max, or Santy won't find our chimney. Ain't that quaint? The goof brain thinks there's a Santy Claus. There isn't? Like father, like goof. Kid's got the goof gene in his bloodstream. There is too a Santa! Now, son, come here. See, it's an urbane myth, like that Locked Ness Monstrosity, and the fella with the sweets takes cheques. Well, think of it. An old guy in a red suit cruising the entire world in one night, using reindeer what fly. Why, it's impossible. Look, kid, I've been around, see. I've been to foreign lands, like Brooklyn, and I've never seen, nor met a soul who's seen, this Santy Claus fella. Look, Maxie, I found the front door. So long, neighbours. Have a very merry Christmas. And a happy New Year. Do-da-do-do Cows and Cauli... Hey, how about giving your old man a hand? What is it, Maxie? Why, you look like Santy Claus put coal in your stocking. I heard there isn't any Santa Claus. Who went and told you a silly thing like that? Mr Pete. Well, that figures. Of course there's a Santy. Or we'd have out-of-work elves. You think? Think? Heck, I'm sure. Son, have I ever been wrong? No. A broken clock is right two or three times a day, and this time I'm right. Believe me, Santa won't let you down. - You really think he'll come? - Why, as sure as pigs fly. Hey, Dad, what did you ask for from Santa? You know, just the usual. What's that? It's a surprise. Now, plug her in and let the joy of Christmas shine. That'll put the spirit of Christmas in you. Course there's a Santa. Believe me, Santa won't let you down... An old guy in a red suit, cruising the entire world in one night, using reindeer what fly. Why, it's impossible, impossible, impossible... Hiya, Maxie. Wanna help? Did you know that there are two billion children in the world? No wonder I keep tripping over roller skates. That means Santa would have to make 800 visits a second, not including bathroom breaks. I guess old Santy's been at it so long, he figured out the short cuts. FLOUR Looks like it's gonna be a white Christmas. Dad, this is serious. I know, son, but... Gosh! Something sure smells mighty tasty. But how can a reindeer fly? That's easy, it's those antlers, they... You know, with the wind and all, that creates lift... Ah ah ah! Hot! Still, it's a lot of work for one guy. That's why we leave him cookies, for a pick-me-up. Just doesn't quite make sense, Dad. Chestnuts. Where are we going, Dad? To share the joy of Christmas with those less fortunate. Shouldn't Santa be doing this? Santy's on a tight schedule this time of year, so we're helping him out. Looks like I might need one, too. Wanna play toy carses? All I got's two, but you can have one. Santa gave me this one last year. This year, I hope he's gonna give me another one. Kid, I ain't so sure there is such a thing as... Christmas Eve dinner is served! - Mr Goofy, that's incredible. - Like magic. Gosh! Christmas magic. Thank you so much. With things being so tight, without you, we wouldn't have... Don't mention it. You'd do the same for me. But have you ever really, actually seen Santa? He's got a big white beard. But have you ever actually seen him in person? Where? - Merry Christmas. - Santa! Santa? You made it! Who wants to be the first to sit on Santy's lap? Me, me. Over here. I'm so glad you came. Wow, I almost didn't believe any more, but now... Everything's OK. So... I want my own one-of-a-kind, carbon fibre, torque rod, snappy flex, tip-to-tail, rail-to-rail, twin-directional snowboard. Please. Dad? You tricked me. How could you? Santy's got a problem with one of his elves, but he'll be back. Gosh, Maxie. I'm real sorry. I was just trying to make those kids happy. Remember my tradition of eating one of Santy's cookies before bedtime? What's the point? Remember how we always open one present on Christmas Eve? Hiya, Maxie. Lookee here, it's your old stuffed bear. - Remember what you named him? - Old Stuffed Bear. - Remember who gave him to ya? - Yeah. Santa. But that's when I was little. No, he's not! Trust me, Max. You just gotta believe. Santy's real. No, he's not. - Yes, he is. - No, he's not! I promise. Then prove it. When Santy shows up, we'll be here to greet him. I'll snap a picture of him so you'll have photographic evidence. Yeah. You'll fall off the roof first. I won't fall off the roof. You just watch. Santy Claus is coming to town! Bright! Told you you'd fall off the roof. I didn't fall off the roof. Where's Santy? I didn't miss him, did I? Nope. Then where is he? I don't know about you, but I'm cold and tired, and Santa Claus is not coming. Why doesn't he just grow up and face the facts? "Don't forget... ...Max." Oh, Dad. Max, wake up. Look, son, look. It's him, it really is! Do you see him, Maxie? Do ya? Yoo-hoo, Santy. Over here! - Almost forgot. Smile, Santy. - Dad, the lens cap. I'll get it right this time. Come down with your hands up. We have you surrounded. What in the name of Pete is going on, for Pete's sake? Maybe he's running a little late. Dad. Are you OK? You were right about everything. I even fell off the roof. Hey, Dad, it's OK. Santa didn't show. No biggie. Well, since he's not coming, at least we can eat all his cookies. Not hungry. Hey, Dad, here's one from me. Open it. Maybe later. Max? Burglars! Santy! Merry Christmas. Santy, I'm so happy you came. Gosh! I thought you'd be taller. And you look trimmer than your pictures. Well... you know... camera adds 50 pounds. You have to meet Maxie. Yeah, love to, but... gotta get going. Two billion kids, 823 a second. Very tight schedule. Wait, Santy, he's around somewheres. Wait! Santy. Santy. - Maxie? - Hi, Dad. What are you doing dressed up like Santy Claus? I just wanted to make you happy, like you did for our neighbours. Maxie, I might have let you down, but you sure didn't let me down. Could it be? Do you think? Gosh! It sure looks like... Santa Claus. I believe it is. Wow, my own one-of-a-kind, carbon fibre, torque rod, snappy flexed, tip-to-tail, rail-to-rail, wood core, twin-directional snowboard. - Thanks, Santa. - What's all the commotion? If it's another robber, I'm gonna get... him. Santa? Well, hey, Santa, I believed in ya all along. For real and for true. So, where are my presents? Merry Christmas! But what about my squirty gun and my yo-yo? I know you can hear me. Santa didn't forget your gift, did he? Every year, I ask for the same gift, and every year I get it. What's that? - Your happiness. - Uh-oh. What is it, son? Got you the same thing. Merry Christmas, Dad. Merry Christmas, Max. Where are you going? To share my present with little Jimmy next door. That's my boy. So, Christmas is found in the way we live, Not what we receive, but what we can give. Our last present may seem small, Not fancy, flashy or special at all. But this gift can be given by the rich or the poor, /t's a gift of the heart, and it means so much more. Thanks, Joe. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, George. You working? Not tonight. It's Christmas Eve. There it is, Pluto. The perfect gift to go with Minnie's watch. My Minnie. They close at five. I'm a little short now, but you and I are gonna make lots of tips today. - Aren't we, fella? - Yeah. After work we'll pick it up. Let's get this tree to Minnie's. Figaro, there's nothing but bills. How am I going to afford to get Mickey a present? Ah, Mickey, when you play your harmonica, my heart sings. An instrument like that deserves a special case. Yeah. Some day. Come into the kitchen. Breakfast is almost ready. I'm not eating you out of house and home? Course not, silly. I have plenty. For me? Have you got the time, Minnie? - Let's see, it's... - Gosh, sure is a beautiful watch. My one heirloom. It'd look nice with a gold chain around your pretty neck. Oh, Mickey. My goodness, I've got to go to work. Madam. Your sleigh awaits. Oh, how wonderful. Giddy up, Pluto. See you tonight. Fella, we got work to do. Welcome to Crazy Pete's tree lot. Hurry, folks, only one more day till Christmas. Easy credit. No money down. This stuff works pretty good. Merry Christmas. I'll be merry when I've sold all those ten-footers. Why are you standing there with your face hanging out? Get to work! OK, fella. You know what to do. Shake a leg. Quit slacking. There's a customer waiting. Do be careful of the paint. Yes, ma'am. Such a nice young man. Here's a little something for you. I don't expect anything. I'm just glad to help. Oh, boy! Thank you, ma'am, thank you. Hot dog! We'll be able to get Minnie that watch chain. - We'd like to buy a tree... - You folks are looking for a tree? Boy, oh, boy, is this your lucky day. This here's what you folks need. Ten feet of towering Nova Scotia pine. Wow. It's bigger than our house. Well, it's a little more than we need. Missus, I've got to be honest with you, this is all I've got left on the lot. The others have been reservated. You don't want these kids going without a tree now, do you? We are gonna get a tree, aren't we, Daddy? This is all we have. Well, that'll be just fine... for a down payment. I'll set you up with a nice instalment plan. Just sign here. We're gonna get a tree! We're gonna get a tree. Foot off the brake, the kids are waiting. Hey, how about this tree? I found it out back. It hasn't been... reservated. - Wow! - It's beautiful. - Perfect. - We'll take it. Merry Christmas. Thank you again. Merry Christmas. So long. Merry... ...Christmas. I had them on the hook for a ten-foot tree. I'm taking what I would have made from you! - But I... - Now, get out of my lot! Chumps! Somebody's burning their ham... More than warm. It's hot! Not my ten-footers.

My Christmas bonus. - Ginny. - That's Minnie. Right, I've been making a list and checking it twice, and I found that you have been Santa's best little helper this season. Your hard work is about to be rewarded. Close your eyes and hold out your hands. Mr Mortimer, I can't thank you enough. Yes, I know. Don't interrupt. - Penny. - That's Minnie. Whatever.

There must be a way to get Minnie's present by five o'clock. You got any ideas, fella? Don't worry. We'll come up with something, we just gotta. Do you think the band will ever show up? I don't know. They're putting out a fire at Crazy Pete's. It went up like a Roman candle. Chief, looks like the toy drive is a big fat bust. Listen. That music. Come on. Where are we going? A concert in the park. Look, Bub, we're desperate. We need music for the toy drive. You're our only hope. I don't have time. I gotta get a gift for my girl. Look, pal, don't do it for us, do it for the kids. - But I... - Son, to these kids, the only difference between a broken heart and a smile is you. You're on. Break a leg, pal. Look, I'm really sorry, but I can't stay. I got Christmas shopping to do and... Gosh. - The band! - Must have been hot at Crazy Pete's. Guess I'll be showing up at Minnie's empty-handed. Terrific. Thanks to you, this was our best toy drive ever. You and that harmonica make a great team. She's worth her weight in gold. Holy cow! That's it. We've got two minutes to get to the shop. Come on, Pluto. - Thanks, fellas. - Goodbye. - Thanks. - Merry Christmas. Sorry! Hey, what's going on? This is our stop. Look, there's the shop. Excuse me, sir. I was just hoping to trade this for a gift for my girl. Sorry, that harmonica isn't worth much. Well, merry Christmas. You're worth a lot to me, old friend. Say, maybe that harmonica is worth something after all. Come on in. Can't wait to open your present? I know how you feel. I love Christmas so much. Say, Mickey, why don't you play some music? Isn't it time we were opening our presents, and speaking of time, what time is it? Well, I... I think it's time for you to open your gift. A case, for my harmonica. A chain for my... watch. Mickey, it's beautiful, but I traded my watch to get you that case. I traded my harmonica to get you a watch chain. Oh, Mickey, I can't believe you gave up what means the most to you, for me. Minnie, you're all the music I'll ever need. - Merry Christmas, Mickey. - Merry Christmas, Minnie. Want some fruitcake? A gift from the heart is cherished and true. A present is best when love's given, too. So in the end, love is the reason That Christmas is more than a gift-giving season. /t's a time with our loved ones to show that we care, When families and neighbours come together to share. So, this Christmas season, let us all do our parts To keep Christmas spirit alive in our hearts.
