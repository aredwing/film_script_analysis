Because I don't feel like going to public school anymore. .' When you leave, don't turn around,.' .' there is no way back, where you came from..' .' All their jokes, you know them by heart,.' .' you know all their mistrusts,.' .' and you who don't know anything, but yet have been hurt..' .' You simply know everything, you've paid a high price..' .' lf there is a truth, written in black and white,.' .' it's that nothing is yours..' .' You are not alone, someone follows you..' .' And the en tire time, he is like you....' .' like you..' Continuation school. No, it's not the stock office. It's the continuation school. Yeah, that's all right. No, not by bike. - -Yeah, you're smarter than that. What do I know? - -We are going to Fyn. We have some friends there with a small farm. So that's where you're going. This is the teacher's lounge. Oh. Feel free to come in. May I present to you our teachers.. . Mr. Karstensen and Ms. Mortensen. We shouldn't disturb them. They are obviously having professional discussions. Let's continue. Aw, shit. No, not again. Michael, what are you are doing? Boyish tricks. You! You know that's not allowed! This is where our boys live. It is a room with two beds, very comfortable.. . This is our little gym. Listen! Listen up.. . Some weekend permission slips are still missing. Remember that the last deadline is tomorrow afternoon. And I will announce that all classes.. . are cancelled tomorrow after twelve... and for the rest of the day... ... due to a teachers' conference. I knew you would all be disappointed. And then there is an issue that I have to raise with you. Today the school had visitors, people from the municipality, who came to get an impression of our school, and possibly give us a grant for a gymnasium. When the school has guests, it means that one, with great pride, should be able to show off the school. I thought that I could do that today. Until we came into your rooms. Then something embarrassing and disgraceful happened. It concerns decoration in certain rooms.. . one room in any case. The decoration would have been better suited.. . in a brothel than at a continuation school with our reputation. It's not funny, Bo! I demand that the filth be taken down immediately. Mr. Justes is sure to agree with me that we should.. . lock the television room tonight, and go quietly to bed. Lights out by 10. Enjoy! Hey, come here and help! Stop it! Tickle him! Stop it, for Christ's sake! You guys are so stupid. That thing will totally fry your brain. Hey, can you perhaps get us some hash? Lasse, why don't you show us one of your kinky movies? Yeah, let's watch one of your Pornos! You're crazy; imagine if 'Papa Jussy' stepped in here! He would totally flip out! Who the hell is scared of 'Papa Jussy'? That dumb shit. We'll see.. . We'll take one of the Playboy magazines.. . and stick it up his ass! Hey! Try to control yourselves. We actually have a problem we have to take care of. Girls? - -No, not girls. It concerns the forest picnic. You have yours picked out? It's about some wine. How do we get a hold of some? You guys and your god-damned wine! I said that we should get some vodka! You know, we've had this discussion, Ole! And it's been resolved. Just don't come along then! Kim can borrow some bottles from his dad. Does that mean he'll he there? This isn't kindergarten! Kim is okay. It's not his fault he has an old ass for a dad. Ewe, you pig! Kim, what are you doing? You turned off the lights in the kitchen? Mm-hmm. May I, please? - -Yes. Were those pictures hanging in Lars and Ole's room? Yes, of course it was Lars and Ole's room. There's always trouble with them. It's no wonder Ole is the way he is--with those parents. His mother was on welfare and his dad drinks. You should he thankful that you have a good home, my boy. Ole is really nice. Listen up, Kim, I don't think you should hang around.. . the kids in the school as much as you do. What about playing more with the kids from your own school? They are so fucking boring. Kim, I will not permit such language! It does not sound nice, Kim. Can I see the movie on TV tonight? Have you done your homework? - -Yes. I'll hear no more about movies that are unsuitable for children. Good night, Kim. Do you need to be so strict? Once in a while, he should be allowed to stay up a little late. I will not discuss it. The movie is not suitable for children. He is too young, Anna. When Karen and Niels were his age, times were different. I hope that times will never be different.. . when it comes to consistency in his upbringing. Kim should not suffer because he is a late addition. Hey, open the door, jerk! Hey, hey, hey, what's going on here? There should be silence by 10, you know that. Now hurry into your beds. And no running in the halls, you know that too. Hurry, turn off the lights. Hurry up. We are turning them off. Well, it's nice to see we've taken down the pictures.. . Turning off. Good night. Off to sleep now. Good night. Now the interesting part comes! Now old are you, young man? Thirteen. Well, then it is illegal to do anything of the sort. You have to promise me that you will not do something.. . you will later regret. She took off her shirt. Her breasts were heavy and swaying, the minute she moved. The other girls snickered. The chubby one pulled down the zipper of her shorts. She took off her shorts and stood naked in front of him. She had rough brown hair between her legs. They were curly. The excitement charged through his body. He felt burning hot in his loins. His cock began to get hard and.. . Lars, it's time to get out of bed. Come on. Up now. - -Yeah, yeah. Hurry up a little. You have some toilet paper? Mom, I'm going to the store! Hi, Bo. - -Hi. Good morning, Karsten. You guys are so stupid! Oh, I see you were jacking off last night, huh? .' All of God's birds both big and small..' .' They fly from the nest and safety..' .' We praise our Lord, so well as we can..' .'In song, in life and as far as the eternal light glows..' .' Now further on the church grounds....' .' and the sun comes shining in..' .' We sing good morning, we sing hello,.' .' we sing our father, thank God for all we have....' Bo, please pay attention. Democracy means that the majority determines.. . the policy that would become law. The party or parties that get the most votes.. . in the present and closest election, meaning the party or parties.. . that have received the biggest mandate. Man-date. ... determines which politics the country will run under. The method is called a cabinet responsibility. 'She has some nice tits.' - -'Who?' Cab-i-net Res-pon-si-bi-li-ty Yes, Aske. How can one be assured that the needs of the people.. . are reflected in the laws? Shit, he sounds like a real professor. It is all of us, the Danish people, those of us that have voting rights that elect those.. . who sit in the parliament. Who else? Who has voting rights? Anyone above the age of 20. Yeah, but what about all of us who are under 20? Are we not also 'the people'? Well, yes, then the people's representatives, if you will. The people who only some of us have chosen. The legal voting age is 20 and there are no motions to change it. 'The girl who is in love with me.' Young people are, for the most part, politically immature.. . and that is where you are a perfect example. What do you think our trade partners in Brussels.. . would say if we had both a retired and children's party? That doesn't matter. It is much more important that the young and the old are heard, otherwise we would just be stepped on. Yes, Bo. - -Grundtvig. Yes, what about Grundtvig? He was a revolutionary. Yes, he probably was, but he was definitely not a communist. He was a Christian person. Furthermore.. . What the hell are you up to? Revolution? Shut up, you two! Yes, that is exact change. Could you please take these onions.. . and deliver them to the school? Yes. Hi. - -Hi, what do you want? A pack of cigarettes. Just one minute. Yes, supermarket. Yes, hi, what can I.. . Watch out. - -Yeah, watch it, punk. Get out of here. By the way, it looked totally awesome when.. . Mogens stole the field from Olsen. Yeah, it was a really cool game. Did you get some candy? I only got one. Yeah, I got two or three pieces. You want some? Hey, by the way, are you going on the weekend trip with Britta? No, I fuckin' don't feel like it. You aren't even allowed to make tracks when you play Indians. I'm going on a forest picnic with the big kids. That will be awesome! Look, here come the others. - -Yeah. Hi, Bo! Hi. - -Hi. Have you been to school? Did you think I'd been at a brothel? You want a lift? - -Yes, please. So sit up here. Stop. Help! Aw.. . Shit bike! Owe, my leg. Shit. Does it hurt a lot? Oh. Kim? - -Yeah. Can you keep a secret? - -Of course. Come on! Is it yours? - -Yeah. I built it so that I can have some privacy from time to time. Come on. This is the emergency exit. - -Emergency exit? Yeah, you never know what can happen. Isn't it beautiful? - -Yup, it is beautiful here. Sure is. It's about time! - -Bring over the goods. What's in the bag, Ole? Relax! Don't wrinkle it and my Yankee bar. Here. Here's yours. So you're going to be yanking the old skin tonight. Just make sure it doesn't get into the mashed potatoes. Hey, I know you go into the forest, and play with yourself.. . and get all blue in the head. We'll go out and watch you tonight. Here, take that, you creep! Oh, calm down. Ole! Stop! You pig. Shit, Ole. - -That's enough. You won't even remember your name for weeks. Ole, stop. They can see you from the window. Ole, stop! Get off him! What did you say? You can come out to the forest tonight.. . and get beat up some more! You little pussy. Here are the onions. - -Thank you. Miss, can I please have a whisky with whipped cream.. . served with a straw, with some foolin' around on the side? Catch this. Bo! Over here! Stop it. Here, Aske. Hey! What the hell is this? What the hell is going on here? What do you think this is, a sex club? Get out of the kitchen. What do you think the headmaster would say.. . if he saw you guys all over each other like that? It wouldn't be very likely if we didn't fool around. Can we please work in peace? Regarding the pictures in Lars and Ole's room, that incident is over, but I wanted to discuss it.. . because I don't want to have another situation like last year.. . when we unfortunately had to dismiss three students.. . because they could not maintain their self-discipline, and had girls and fooling around on their brains. The gymnasium. - -Yes, the gymnasium. You all know that we have had a visit from the municipality.. . and today I have heard we have been awarded the grant.. . for the proposed gymnasium. I still think that the money would be better used to build.. . a new dorm to accommodate girls here at the school. In my opinion, sports are healthy for boys' development. It strengthens their feeling of responsibility. I must once again point out that the continuation schools.. . that admit both girls and boys have only had trouble. Can we please be careful not to... pigeon-hole all continuation schools... based on one fight. I know several schools that function perfectly well, where there are absolutely no prob.. . Sorry, but when does the bank open? You have to wait a little bit. We are almost done. Please close the door. Okay.. . What is the next item on the agenda? It is regarding the graduation party. Yeah.. . Andersen, you are on watch. Would you please? Okay.. . The celebration, I must admit that I am a bit concerned.. . about this year's dramatization of the ten commandments. The kids' version promises to be entertaining? Don't worry, it will certainly be entertaining and festive! Come down here, Lars. I don't like that it's so dark. What if someone comes down here? No one will. Come here. No, you have to open your mouth when you kiss. Not like that. Like this. No! Someone's coming. No one's coming down here. You know that. Lie down here. One minute. What is it? Can't you see that I'm on the phone? I have a book for you. - -Just put it there. Yes, excuse me, where were we? Be careful not to rush it here at the end. That was good, Kim. I have another one that is a bit more difficult.. . that we can try. Hmm... where did I put it? It's here somewhere.. . What are you doing here? I had to deliver a song... I mean, a book to your husband. Then give it to me. He is talking on the telephone. Goodbye, Bo. Man, it shoots really well. Can I paint you? - -Okay. Sit down then. Like this and like this. It tickles. Indians paint themselves in the Spring, and then they do a war dance. Where did you get that from? It's from a book that we read in class, called 'Long Spear.' Turn around so I can paint your back. Yeah. Bo? - -Yeah. What do you think my dad means when he says.. . 'mothers of a doubtful reputation'? It means that they earn money by going to bed with men. Oh. Look at what I found in the forest. What kind of bird is it from? A pheasant. I found it at a raven ditch. Should we go there together some day? Sure, when? Early in the morning, so we can see the baby birds. I'll never get permission from my dad. No problem. Just come out real early in the morning. I told them we'd be back around 10 o'clock. Hi, Kim. - -Hi. Oh yeah, it's bath day today. I'm going to take a shower. I'll go with you. Don't you ever wash your penis? Of course. No, I mean also under the foreskin. Do you have to? Yes, otherwise we'll stink. Will you soap my back? - -Yeah. Do you have sex education in school? What do you learn there? You learn how to avoid having kids. I know about that! You also learn how to masturbate. Masturbate? Jack off. - -Oh, that. You can do it many different ways. What else do you guys learn? You also learn that sex is wonderful. Can you hand me the shampoo? Here. - -Thanks. What the hell? Woo! Sex is wonderful! Hey, you two. Don't go so far out. Come back in! Jesper, you're bleeding. It's the artery. Stand here, I'm coming out to you. Help hold it there. Bo, run back to the school and get help. He's hurt? Hurry, hurry. Jesper, weren't you scared? Even a little bit? Yeah, a little. - -There was so much blood. It squirted out just like a waterfall. That actually wasn't what hurt the most. I got a shot right in my ass. That was worse. That's typical--every time something exciting happens. I forget my camera. Once, I had hit my leg with a big axe and I didn't realize it.. . until my entire boot was filled with blood. This long. In the newspaper a while back. I read about a guy who was riding a motorcycle, behind a truck with steel plates. One of the plates shifted and he was too close to it.. . and it hacked his head off and the blood just squirted like this. When he was hit, his nerves were stuck and his hands.. . held onto the accelerator and the motorcycle.. . drove up next to the truck and the truck driver sees him.. . and was like this, and passed out and smashed the entire truck.. . into a tree and killed himself. Give me my toothpaste. It's mine. Take your hands off. Why are you stealing my toothpaste? Stop, for Christ's sake. - -What's going on? He stole my toothpaste, that fag! I wouldn't use your nasty, spermed-up toothpaste. Go home and suck your father's dick! That's it! Go. Bo, are you going to shower? - -No. Then would you please go turn off the lights.. . in the showers down by the gym? Sure, I'll just brush my teeth first. - -That's fine. What are you reading? 'The Forgotten Spring,' by Hans Scherfig. You seem a little down. Is there something you are sad about? My parents, once in a while. I miss my mom and dad. I want to go home.. . and talk to them a bit and see how they are doing and stuff. It's almost summer vacation. Are you going on summer vacation with your parents? Yes. We're going to Bornholm on a tour. That sounds exciting. I know it's stupid of me to cry. But it helps when I miss them so much. There, there, Aske. It will be okay. We'll get through it. - -We? You can get through it! You can leave here and go home to... your family when you're not on duty. The rest of us have to stay here, never having a private life. We are always pretending, playing a role! Turn off the lights when you guys leave, okay? As you all know, when the first king, 'Gorm the Old'.. . ruled over Denmark,... anyone know what his wife's name was? Yes. - -Daneho. Daneho. They had two sons, Knud and Harald. Anyone know where they lived? - -Not on Old King's Road. They lived in Jutland. Coffee is not an intoxicating substance. Yes, it actually is, but it's not... something that people usually think of. Coffee contains something called caffeine.. . and caffeine is stimulating stuff. For example, if you drank 100 cups of coffee in one sitting, there's a possibility that you could actually die from it. What do you want to say, Bo? Is that why I always get a bit weird and sweaty.. . when I drink too much coffee? Yes, that is exactly how people get when they drink too much coffee. Good, well, if we now take hash and separate that.. . from all the other substances that we have spoken about, can you become dependent on hash the same way as one can become dependent on alcohol? No. Alcohol is much more dangerous than hash! Does any one else have a different opinion? Physically, you are not dependent on it. But I think I've read that psychologically, one can become dependent on it like one does with cigarettes. What a bunch of crap! You can't be dependent on it the same way that you are on opium. I think you guys should hear part of a tape.. . that I recorded from the radio. There was an interview last week with... a 14-year-old boy from Copenhagen... and it is very relevant to what we have been talking about. I need it for food. - -Yeah. I live in a group home there... and we need it. I use it for food. I use mostly hash. Why do you smoke hash? Because I like smoking hash. I feel like shit if I don't have hash for a whole day. Do you smoke hash everyday? Yes, otherwise I can't fucking live. I feel good if I have hash. Are you addicted to hash? - -Yeah, I can't do without it. I think I would.. . I would scream. There are many people who know me who say that too. Because I live with various others. Yeah. That's stupid that Petersen gave me detention today. It's not my fault that there are a pair of shorts lying in the hallway. He is always so damn mad. He has a brain filled with dirt. And when you asked if it was time for Sex Ed, that was really a good line. It could be that he's never screwed his wife or jacked off. Have you ever seen one with hair on it? Yup, Bo has a huge one with lots of hair on it. I'll bet he can screw really well with that dick. Can you shoot when you jack off? Of course. .' Rock, it comes as a shock..' .' Rock, what does it lead to ?.' .' Self broadcast..' .' Look..' .' Look..' Okay, okay, let's stop here. You guys too. Come over here with the rest of us. Let's sit down and talk it through. Let us start by hearing from you, Jesper. How did it make you feel? I felt as if I was being shunned and kept outside. Did you feel like you were being bullied? Yes, of course I did. - -Were you scared? Yes, I was. - -Ole, how about you? I felt more like it was something violent. I feel like it should be more like pulling his nose.. . and psychological violence instead. Yeah? Bjorn. No, I think it worked on a psychological level.. . because it was not really violent. It was more like little irritations. Yes, I think you are onto the right thing, but I think.. . we should stop for now and come back to it tomorrow. We have an hour then too. Now for something else that is pressing is that.. . we still don't know what we're going... to do for the second commandment; Love others as you love yourself. Anyone have any suggestions on that one? Jens, I have an idea. - -Yes? Could I be allowed to make a movie of it? Yes, that sounds good, actually. What do you guys say to that? Well, there is just one thing you have to remember, it should not be longer than 10 minutes. That's not a problem. What did you expect, a feature film? Well, what does everyone say to that? Well, then that is taken care of. I think that we should stand up and do the mirror exercise. Hi. Dad. - -Yes. There is something I want to talk to you about. Not just now, buddy. Can you wait a little? No. I'll go up to my room. - -That's fine. Do you have some time? Of course, what is it? I think there is something you should hear. Okay. Hello. Would you please repeat what you said to me earlier? I think we should have some things clarified. Yes, it's not because.. . I just think you should know. I think it's nice to know who your children hang around with. I don't understand. I came home right at lunch, more exactly, right after lunchtime, and I find my boy, Tony, lying right in the middle of the carpet, kind of weird, totally red in his face, and pressing... kind of weird onto the carpet. I asked him of course what he is doing and he turns around.. . with a huge grin on his face, and says,...'Sex is wonderful.' I sat and thought of where he would have read such filth. He hangs around Kim a lot. And he hangs around a lot with the kids here at the school.. . and they are not all exactly nice boys, are they? I don't understand. This doesn't sound like Kim. You're right. Rest assured, Mrs. Jensen. If there is something to what you've... said, I will surely take care of it. Henrik! Where are you? Kim. Can you please come down here? Kim. Did you see the raven? - -No, I fell asleep too. I'm freezing. We should get home. Aren't you finished yet? Here, hold the dustpan. Give me a puff. Hey! - -You pig! What the hell! - -You little shit. .' Come, let us find, let us... disappear in to a place in the forest..' .' Far in there where you sit on a log and has the sky above....' .' and moving and crawling... free..' .' I like flowers, I like girls and I like wine..' .' Beautiful are the flowers, boys and girls and prospects..' .' Loosen my clothes, help me - free..' .' Free me from those who beat the heart out of you..' .' Free me from those who only make one's life miserable..' .' Free me... from those who only put me down..' .' Free me... from those who only put me down..' .' Demanding lo v e, demand for every one..' Bo, stop playing with that wine. It can't stand that, and you'll spoil it. There's nothing but piss wine. We should have bought some real alcohol. It's nice to have a glass of wine. Better off with a glass of schnapps. And a can of liver pat. What is so funny? I just thought of the time I went to the supermarket and asked him for some pat de foie gras.. . and he said, 'Yes, yes, we have cans of pat.' Yeah, they are a bit crazy down at that supermarket. Yesterday Lars and I were down there to buy some rubbers. We told the lady that we wanted and she thought we meant rubber bands! So I had to explain to her that it was condoms and.. . she had to go to the owner and talked to him. I think they have a list of stuff they are not allowed to sell to us. What's on the list? How am I supposed to know? Anyway, we didn't get any. I think she's supposed to talk to the headmaster.. . before giving us any. I'm sure about that. Let's eat! .' Let it be summer, hear how it's humming,.' .' taking its time....' .'... taking its time..' .' The drums are playing, we are... playing a number on our stomachs... .' we play on the flutes, free..' .' Let me be thirsty, I'll drink the old red wine..' .'... old red wine..' .' Totally wonderful, unashamed, we laugh..' .' Those raisins I will bless, free..' .' Free me from those who beat the heart out of you..' .' Free me from those who only make one's life miserable..' .' Free me... from those who only put me down..' .' Free me... from those who only put me down..' .' Demanding love, demand for every one..' Romeo and Juliet kiss. Hey, hey, not so violent. A little more feeling. A little more feeling. A little more warmth. A carrot. Stop it. It tickles. I'll try something funny.. . try closing your eyes. Come on! Whoops. Come here, you are drunk. Lie down here. - -No, I don't want to sleep. Just rest a little. - -Okay. Shhh, quiet. This is so much fun. Can you see his father totally flipping out? Ole, shut up. Kim, you have to handle yourself now, okay? Try to go upstairs and get into... bed without anyone noticing, okay? You understand? It's you! Where have you been all day? Are you sick? What's wrong? He must have eaten something that made him sick. We have to send out for the doctor! A doctor? The boy is drunk! Thank you. Go up to bed again. When one is sick, one stays in bed. And I have something to talk to you about. Go. Yeah, I'm gonna get one. Hi, Bo! - -Hi! I am so full! - -Yeah, me too. Oh man, my tire is flat. Shit. Must be those stupid farmer assholes. I think we lost them. I can't see them anyway. Bo? - -Yeah. Do you think it was silly that time? What? That time in the bathroom. That was totally fine. I was really scared. I thought it was one of the teachers that came in. I think it's fine if you're with either a boy or a girl. Last summer, I was with a boy.. . that I really came to care a lot about. I think they're gone. Come on. The headmaster was just here and says you should go to bed. Screw him, we are in the middle of playing cards. Can you not come back in a couple of days? I just have to win a couple million. Come on. - -Okay. The headmaster mentioned something about a party. Do you guys know anything about that? Absolutely nothing. Just between us, he is on the warpath, so I suggest you go quietly into your rooms.. . and to bed without any complaints. I think Anderson is a fag. Why do you say that? He is always touching me. You know what, one doesn't have to be gay.. . just because he touches someone's shoulder. Shit, it's just like jail. Go to bed everyone, otherwise the big bad headmaster.. . will come and shout BOO at you! That's strange. Who could it be this late? There was a light in the bathroom and I thought.. . you should see this. Get all the students into the gym... immediately. It's almost 11:30. Isn't it better to.. . Immediately! But that I have to discover this kind of filth yet once again.. . This time in the bathroom. I am glad that Andersen had his eyes about him.. . and reported it to me immediately. That is also the only thing I am happy about in this situation. I warned you last time. But this time, I cannot look away from what has happened. I would ask that the offenders present themselves instantly. Well.. . We can be here all night for all I care. I have time. You cannot seriously mean that we will dismiss Ole. He has enough problems to begin with. And I seriously think that the... personal development of children... should come before the school's reputation. Hogwash. The kids cannot be harmed by a couple of pornographic pictures. A couple of pornographic pictures? This school is filled with porn. I know you don't think that we should have that gymnasium. It has nothing to do with dismissing Ole. Was it you or I that showed around the municipality people? I know exactly what I'm doing, Mr. Karstensen. Not by dismissing Ole. We cannot let them tyrannize us. We must set an example. Imagine if all the kids just went and pasted porno.. . wherever they felt like it. It was exactly not wherever. It was first in the rooms, which should and.. . must remain the children's private quarters. And then in the bathroom. After Mortensen had prohibited it, don't forget that. No, I agree with the headmaster. We should not be too forgiving. We should also think of the other children.. . who are not used to this stuff, who come from good Christian families.. . who might feel that their modesty is being impinged upon. What crap! In today's world, children are used to seeing pictures of naked girls. There are loads of them all over the newspapers, and if I recall, you yourself. Mr. Justisen, read Extra Bladet. Definitely not to look at naked girls, Mr. Karstensen. Mr. Justisen, no one is saying that you sit.. . and study the naked pictures. It is just said that children are used... to seeing those kinds of pictures... and don't feel that their modesty is being impinged. Anderson, what do you think? I think that it was wrong of the children.. . especially after having been warned. I don't think that it should go unpunished. But could you not give a firmer warning.. . and then speak to the parents? No, no, Andersen. You know the parents aren't any better. We have to hold onto our principles. I implore that you understand that we will have.. . a better working environment if we all agree. Then let us agree on not dismissing him. Impossible. Then there is nothing we can do, but to vote. Who votes to dismiss Ole? Do you mean that I am thrown out of the school? Call it what you will. School is almost over. You should have thought about that earlier. We will make sure your parents are advised tonight. Kiss my ass, you idiot! Who the hell do you think you are? What do you stand for? Do you know what you voted yes to? Do you know Ole? Do you know about his background at all? Yes, yes, you can talk. You are a permanent employee with living quarters. What the hell am I? A stinking substitute with a family to take care of. It has nothing to do with that. This concerns Ole. - -I am aware of that! You have to take a little consideration, all right! And even though a warning had been issued, it is evident that a warning was not enough. We had to therefore get rid of the rotten apple, which you would think is a little harsh on your fellow student, but it was the only thing to do under the circumstances. Yes, Aske, what is it? I would like you to leave the room. What do you want? I would like you to leave so that we can discuss.. . the dismissal of Ole. I do not agree with you and I bet that.. . there are several others here who do not agree with you. You must be crazy. Leave? Do you know who you are talking to? I am the headmaster here. Leave? I make the decisions. You are not leaving then? No. By my God-given right, I won't. Well, then I'll leave, and all those who have.. . the same opinion as me can just follow me. And those who dare to have an opinion can also come. Shouldn't we just turn it into a brothel? Piss off! Can you remember when you were making out in the forest? Shut up. Can't you just shut up? Where are we going to get the paint? And the money? I'll arrange that somehow. What are you doing here? I just thought that I should tell you that I support.. . your action and if there is anything I can do to help, please let me know. Yes, please. There is the door right there...use it. Shut up, Ole. If you could get the others to come over to our side. That would be great. Shoot the headmaster. If you could get us some paint. Regarding getting others to come over to your side. I would think it best that you do that yourselves. But I really think that I can get Conradsen.. . to find you some paint and if you have time, paint this room as well. I think it would be a great student lounge. Yeah, make out room! Haven't you ever drunk before? Yes, but suddenly I just got dizzy. The last I can remember is that my dad got really upset with me. Here is the hole. Hold it. Could you not remember anything? Yes, I remember when you blew my belly button. I ran into Rohin one day and they said my dad was stupid.. . to have some stupid Copenhagen communists here at the school. What happened then? - -Then I left. You think I want to fight with that kind? .' And we raise to our fatherland,.' .' that lies behind the river..' .' There the waves rush in across with warm waters....' .' over the old golden sands..' .' So there we will stay for all times,.' .' and the lights will always shine..' Yes, it is nice to see that there are some responsible ones.. . who prefer education instead of boyish tricks. I can assure you that you are the ones who have chosen.. . the sensible alternative. Where the hell are the thermoses? I don't know. Kirsten? Isn't this still leisure night? No, the headmaster has prohibited me from serving.. . coffee until you guys go back to class again. How primitive! Does he think we will fall for that? Yeah, well.. . I did make you two thermoses, if you guys can shut up about it. Cool! It will cost you a kiss. - -Okay. Can't I get one too? Of course you can. Don't tell anyone though. - -Okay. Who called? Petersen from the municipality. What did he want? He wanted to know what was going on at the school. Is it really right to send Ole home right before graduation? It should be a festive day. You know it's not just up to me. It has to be brought up at the next teacher's meeting. It would be a catastrophe if the... students lose respect for the teachers. Young people must live with consequences, so I intend to stand my ground, in any case. Where is Kim? He's gone to bed. - -Really? .' Here we see one of your small ones..' .' Here, each, to collect..' .' He gets a life that has a little bit more meaning,.' .' that lo v e is more than Christian stories..' .' One of them that shouts..' .' One of the young losers..' .' One of them that doubts the truth..' .' We hear you..' Bo, where are you? - -Right here. .' Losers..' .' Stand there and mope..' .' Creates themselves in the chaos..' .' There is nothing to believe in..' .' Losers..' .' Shouts for hope..' .' Gets kicked out of heaven..' .' There is nothing to believe in..' .' Lots of pictures to stare at..' .' Tons..' .' Loser..' .' Here you see one of your lights.' .' It's a shame that it should be like that..' .' He hopes..' .' That your herds are filled with lies..' .' So scared of themselves that they never dare to stand naked..' .' One that shouts..' .' One of the young losers..' .' One of them who doubts the truth..' .' We hear you..' .' Loser, stands there and mopes..' .' Creates themselves in the chaos..' .' There is nothing to believe in..' .' Losers..' .' Shouts for hope..' .' Gets kicked out of heaven..' .' There is nothing to believe in..' .' Lots of pictures to stare at..' Justisen is one of the teachers at the school to be interviewed. Why can't Ole stay? Stop that silliness. Stop that. You should rather start your classes again instead of.. . all this nonsense. Use your time for something wiser. Why can't we be a part of the... decision-making process in the school? You know very well that we have certain rules here.. . at the school and they must be upheld. Stop that. Go away. Why did you vote to have Ole leave? Why do you think? Stop it. Get out of the way. Stop all that. We can ask them over here. I'm sure they have a negative opinion. Why have you not joined in leaving the classes here at the school? Is Ole not your friend? I don't know really. I think it's really crap with all this porno. No, it's not! - -Yes, it is. It's in the bathrooms. A guy can't go anywhere where there isn't any porno. There's no use doing this. The headmaster is strong. You should realize that. There are two that go.. . What is this? Class is in session. I am sorry that we are disturbing you. We would like an interview with the headmaster about our strike. Interview, for what? We would like send it to the public television, children's division. I won't have this nonsense! Get out! I'm teaching here. You are disturbing the class. Get out! Out! - -Okay. Close the door. Close the door! A nice little throat you have. Come on, Martin. Have you ever seen a chicken that is running away.. . after it's had its neck cut? Let's see the blood! The chick screams as the fox sinks its teeth in it. Come on, Martin. A nice little cut there. Can't we go now? Slice. Let's go. - -Shut up. It's a little fun. Communist. You forgot to cut him. Cut him. - -Tear it. Take it off. Hey, over here. Polish my shoe. Nice to see a communist at work. How does it feel to work? Put some elbow grease in it. Lick it! Do what Martin tells you. Lick it! I said, lick my shoe! Whoever touches him gets a beating. Hey, Martin! Kiss my ass! No way, you faggot pig. I said, kiss my ass! Bo, are you sleeping? Shhh, be quiet. Aske is sleeping. Oh, you're so cold! She's coming. Quiet for one minute so that I can tell you that.. . it was unanimously decided that Ole can stay at the school. I am so excited that we're going to perform. I am just so nervous. How long is your performance? An hour. - -An hour? If I could have your attention, please. I will tell you a bit about the performance that.. . the students this year are about to present. We have chosen to use the ten... commandments as a starting point, but as you can see here, we have changed it to six that we feel are relevant to our day and age. The students have had the freedom... to translate the six commandments. Finally, I would like to ask that... you not smoke during the performance. Thank you. Turn it on. We can be proud of the many young people today.. . who fight so that we may live in peace. I bless the weapons that will be used against our enemies. I bless the soldiers who today fight in God's name. God be with all of us. Amen. Bo... plug it in. Karstensen. Have you seen the movie? - -No. Isn't this exciting? Lights off!
