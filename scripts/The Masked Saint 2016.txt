I haven't seen you since the end of the month, where have you been?! - I am getting so sick of this! - I do tell people that I'm a single mother, you know why? 'Cause you're never here! There is no point to us anymore! There's... Like, why are you even home?! - Is this all you gonna do? Is this all you gonna do?! I don't wanna be here anymore, we're done. We're through! - Hey, Dad, I gotta... - Not now, Chris, I gotta go. Don't give your mother any grief, you hear? - Christopher! Come do your chores! - Fight! Fight! - Fight! Fight! - You want more, runt? You can't take it, you're so small! - Ugh! Stop it, Mike! Don't get up! - Here we are in the WFW wrestling main event against the Gladiator of Good and the Burly Beast. There's an arm twist, elbow knock, and the Beast gets him into a neck hold! The Gladiator reverses on the Beast, sending him into the corner! - Uh-oh! The Gladiator does his drop toehold! The Gladiator of Good can basically go straight to the winner's circle. This is one of the most devastating submission moves! Legs can be broken this way! Kids, don't try this at home! - Well, if it isn't the runt! - Ugh! Leave me alone, Mike! - Ha! Do you hear that? The piglet speaks! Woah! OW! OW! OK! I GIVE! I GIVE! Ow! Let's get outta here. - Hehe! Hey, Chris, what's goin' on, man? - Hey, Iceman! Hey, how are you? - I'm good! - Good! Hey, who's the bright ray of sunshine over there? - Oh, that guy? That's one of Nicky's new guys. He goes by the name "The Reaper"! - That's impressive. - Hey, at least you're going out on top! - Yeah! It's, uh... nice Nicky let me keep it, though. - Nicky? Nicky Stone is a soulless conman who's so backstabbing and two-faced that he has to... - "...to wear his glasses at the back of his head!" You need new material, there, partner! How you doin'? Nice to see ya. - Good to see you! - Can I speak with you a second? - Sure. - Good. Not busy, are you? - No. - Come over here, listen, bud. I got you with Jake the Giant Killer. So, if you could, like, go about 10 minutes, put him over, that'd be great. - Nicky... Nicky, I... I don't wanna lose. - Go do your job. Christopher! - Nicky. - Nice to see you. Listen, I really need you to reconsider my offer. I mean, go home and just think about it. We need our knight in shining armor... - Told you, Nicky; I'm done. - God... Hallelujah! Praise be, you have a higher calling, now! I hope you have as much fun behind the pulpit as you had in the ring, Pastor. 'Cause I'm the guy who put you in the ring. And there's another thing. Sometimes... the bad guy's gotta win. Like tonight. - Nicky...! - Nicky, nothing. You are under contract, OK? That means if you don't do what the promoter says, that's breach of contract. Breach of contract; I sue you. Look at me when I'm talking to you. That means I sue you! Why give all that money to the lawyers? That's... That's silly! - Daddy! - Care Bear, come here! - Hey! She just had to see you. - Jen. - It's Michelle. - Of course it is, yeah. And Casey! - It's Carrie. And the Saint is the best wrestler ever! - And on that note, I think I'll go see the next fight. Excuse me, Jen. You're gonna have such a good time. - AAH!! - Yeah... - Here we are at the WFW Wrestling main event of the evening! The Saint has been on a farewell tour ever since announcing his retirement, and tonight is his very last match AND what an opponent he has. New to the canvas, at 7 feet tall and 300 pounds, the Reaper! Woah! The Saint baseball slides right into...! One, two... Oh! That was close! - This is awesome! Reverse slam him! And the Reaper brandishes the Saint with a low blow! That one will definitely slow him down. Oh! That was just brutal! The Reaper is not letting up! He has no first match jitters. Oh! Into the turnbuckle goes the Saint! He is strugglin'! - Take it easy, bro! We got 2 minutes left, don't spend it all upfront! - The only thing spent is you, 'cause I'm coming for that belt. Reaper! Reaper! - Reaper! Reaper! - Hear, the crowd is starting to cheer for the Reaper! Oh, this is not how the Saint wanted to go out! - DADDY!! - It's... it's OK, sweetie, it's just... it's just acting, remember? I told you. It's just acting... - Yeah! - The Reaper certainly has the Saint against the ropes... - Good night, Saint! - and is dragging him into the middle of the ring for what could be a signature move! Oh yeah! Oh, that dropped knee looked like a world of hurt for the Saint! And here goes the suplex! Oh! The Saint got a couple of knees in! And a reverse small package! One, two... Oh, but the Reaper breaks out! Halfway, a drop kick! It looks like the Saint has found his second wind! Oh, that was an amazing move, ladies and gentlemen! The first time the Reaper's on the canvas today! The Reaper just caught the Saint in a flying cross! - AH! - The faith breaker! - Dad just did the faith breaker! - Leave it to the Saint! He just pulled off another miracle! Listen to that crowd, folks! They love the man in white! - What are you doing, Christopher? - They're chantin' his name now! - Saint! Saint! Saint! - Daddy, watch out! - Oh, man! The Reaper throws the Saint across the ring! Oh! It looks like this match isn't over. The Reaper grabs the Saint's left leg! - What's happenin'? What's happenin'? What's happenin'? - Let him go! Let him go! - No mercy! - No-no-no-no-no!! - Daddy! - That's not right. - Ah! Ladies and gentlemen, and the winner! WFW champion: The Reaper! The Reaper! - Hey, hey, hey! Is he OK? What's wrong? What happened? - Do we want the lampshades or no? - Honey, they're attached to the wall! - Not if you want it, it won't be! - Maybe leave them for the new owners so they can have a little light too? - Your loss, Mom. - Aha! The last bedroom box standing. - I think most of the stuff, we can donate. Right, Piper? Pipes agrees. Go get Carrie! - Your leg gonna make the trip OK? - Ah... - Oh, Chris! - Leg's come a long way. - One good thing came out of all of this. It's that the Reaper will never wrestle again. Nicky saw to that. - Nicky... And now, you have got a congregation to lead. - You ready for Westside Baptist? - I'm ready for the church... I don't know if I'm ready for Michigan. - You know, when I interviewed with the search committee, they accurately described it as the wrong side of the tracks. - Well, we will go where the good Lord sends us, even though Florida would've been a bit warmer. - Michelle, the, uh... last pastor only lasted 3 months. One before him, 7. There were threats made by local gangs... - Local gangs and the church isn't doing so well, I know. The Lord never gives us more than we can handle. In the interview, they said they wanted a fighter, didn't they? - Literally or figuratively? - I think in your case, they're getting a little bit of both. - Got it! - Oh... - She gets that from you! - Here you go, Piper. Mom, where are we? - Doesn't look that bad! - Gotta trust His plan, right? - Yeah! - Yeah. - Are we there, yet? - Soon, Carrie. Right, hon? - I... think so... - You think so or you know? - Uh... that's a "think so." I don't really know where we're going. - Nice guy, thinks he can drive in the middle of the road! Ask and ye shall receive. It looks huge. Come on, Piper, we're here! Can you believe it?! - You're good? - Yeah, yeah. - Alright. - Pastor Chris, Mrs. Samuels, welcome to Westside! Come on in! Hi! Hi, I'm Tim McDonald, Westside's treasurer. Takes me a little while, sorry about that. - Hello, Mr. Treasurer! - Hello! You must be Carrie! Hi, I'm Tim. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Can I go play in the snow? - Oh, I... Is she alright in the courtyard? - Absolutely! - Of course, sweetie. I'll be out in a second. - OK! - OK, let's go! - Oh, wow! It's beautiful. - Yeah. - Let me introduce you to... Is everything OK? - Yeah, everything's fine, Tim. - Perfect, actually. - Fantastic, then. Let me introduce you to Mrs. Beasley, our choir leader and finance chairperson. - Oh, he's younger than I thought he'd be! And all bunged up too! - My wife and I look forward to working with you, Mrs. Beasley. - No, only on Wednesdays. - I'm sorry? - Why?! - Sorry, Chris, Mrs. Beasley doesn't understand things so well anymore. - That, there, is my organ. - I hope you like the sound of screeching cats, 'cause that's our choir. They give a whole new meaning to "make a joyful noise to the Lord." - I'm outta here. - Meow! Judd Lumpkin. You must be the new pastor the search committee was so hasty to approve while I was away on business! I hope you last longer than the last two. I do lighting. - Uh, pardon me? - I own Lumpkin Lighting. Out, just in Tennessee with a big-name rock band that rhymes with "The Bones." Yeah, we gave 'em a great show for the tour. Pa-pa-pa-pa!! You want tickets? I can get tickets! - Uh, I don't think... - Uh, Judd, Judd, this is Pastor Chris Samuels and his wife, Michelle. - Nice to meet you, Mr. Lumpkin. - Call me Judd, unless we're in court! Saw your daughter in the parking lot with that little rat. Needs to be on a leash. - Oh, well... well, she is and... and Piper's actually a really well-behaved dog. - Oh yeah, well... I don't wanna tell you how to run your church, Mrs. Samuels, no, no, no. But I will! Haha! I'm the chairman of the board, here! And I'm also Westside's biggest supporter. - Well, I hope there's a lot of church supporters. - Not recently, if you catch my drift. - Yeah. - The leg! How's the leg doing? I mean, you look pretty fit otherwise. You think you'd be ready for rec league? - Rec league...? - Oh, come on, wh... God gave us the Bible and basketball, son, ya know?! Starts in a couple of weeks and I need some fresh blood. Nothin' wrong with the townies, here. No offense, Tiny Tim. But you, you look like an athlete, huh! - Yeah, I just, uh... - Excellent! OK, Tim, make sure they get to the house alright. It's beautiful! One of my investment properties that I loan to the church. One of the perks of being me! Adioso! - And that was Judd! - That blowhard gone? - Here's Westside's books; Among other things, it shows how behind we are on maintenance, a recent drop in attendance and our tithes, which we have very little of. - We should change that. - What are you thinking? - Well, when I was in seminary, they taught us when a pastor moves into a new church, he should go out in the neighborhood and introduce himself. Maybe bring in some new members. - In THIS neighborhood? Good luck with that! - I think it's a great idea, Chris, I will go with you. Is there somewhere we can leave Carrie? At daycare, or..? - Well, Mrs. Samuels, you're looking at the church board here. We're a little understaffed. - Well, maybe that's something I can change. - That would be wonderful. In the meantime, Miss Edna can look after Carrie for you, she'd be delighted. - Miss Edna? - She's one of our church's greatest supporters. - Like Judd...? - Oh, better than that Lumpkin! - Some strange man just called Piper a rat! - Oh, come here, sweetie, it's OK. Have a little faith Feel His mercy and compassion Have a little faith... - Is this the place? - This is the address Tim gave me. - Oh! Hello! Hello, Pastor Chris! - Hello! - I'm Miss Edna Clark; Everybody likes to call me Miss Edna. Please, come in, come in. - Is it OK if the dog comes? - Every creature is welcome in my home. - Thank you. - Dollhouse! Cool! - So you're saying the church hasn't been able to support itself in years? - Well, Judd is the only thing supporting that church. But, unfortunately, Judd is also the reason our congregation has fallen to less than half. Nobody can stand that man. - Maybe Judd needs an attitude adjustment. - Chris! Um... you'll have to excuse my husband, Miss Edna, sometimes, he forgets he's a pastor now. - My husband and I gave everything we had to Westside Baptist and, when the pastorship opened again, I asked Tim: Please, Tim, find us a fighter! - That was you! - That was me. You forgot your umbrella. - Thank you. - So, go find some lost souls. - We will. - Bye, guys! - Bye! - Let's go play with the dollhouse, Miss Edna. - It's a deal, come on. - Should we do this the old school way? - Door to door, baby. - Ha! I don't think it's gonna rain. I told you it would rain. - Yeah. Hi, I'm Pastor Chris, this is my wife, Michelle. We're from Westside Baptist. We're having service on... That was fun! - There's bound to be at least one family around here that wants to greet us! - Yeah. Hi, I'm Pastor Chris, this is my wife Michelle. We're from Westside Baptist! Hi, I'm Chris Samuels, this is my wife, Michelle. The new pastor, Westside Baptist. We're just in the neighborhood and we thought that... Well, that was successful! - Just means there is still work to be done. Alright! - No. - What? - My leg's killing me. I just... it's just... it's raining, can we just... I'm spent. Can we just call it a day? - Have we really tried our best? Hm? Miss Edna said she wanted a fighter! OK, fine, one more. See? No one's home. - I think someone's in there. - Who are you? - Hi, I'm Pastor Chris Samuels and this is my... - Hi! I'm Michelle and this is my husband Chris. He just became pastor at Westside Baptist church. - We don't go there anymore. - That's OK, we just wanted to introduce ourselves to the neighborhood. - Alright, then. Come on and sit if you want. Um... This is Ashley. - Hi, Ashley! - Ash, can you say hi to Pastor Chris and Miss Michelle? - Hi! - Nice to meet you, Ashley. You know, we have a little girl about your age named Carrie. Maybe we bring her by to play sometime? - I don't think Ray would like that. - Is Ray your husband? - You know, this was a bad idea. You better get going before he comes back. - Mindy, why don't you come to the church? - There are things we can talk about. - Yeah, what kind of things, Preacher?! - Hi, I'm Pastor Chris Samuels, this is my wife Michelle. - Yeah, I heard what you said already. We ain't interested. - Well... Mindy seemed quite interested. - Preacher man, you don't know the first thing about Mindy... or me. I think you should leave, now. - We were just going... Chris. - If you change your mind, door's always open. - Not ours! You don't come around here no more. No one wants what you're selling! I didn't know we were entertaining! - I thought you were about to hit him. - Almost did. You saw the bruises! Someone... someone needs to teach him what that feels like. - Chris! We're not going down this road again. You don't repay evil with more evil. This isn't the wrestling ring anymore, come on. Let's go get Carrie. What a friend We have in Jesus All our sins and griefs to bear And what a privilege to carry Everything to God in prayer - Thank you, Mrs. Beasley, that was lovely. Screeching cats! Ahem! Um, I'd like to thank everyone for, uh, coming to my first sermon. Today, I would like to begin by talking about, um... no, not that one... uh... faith! Yes, faith. You see, uh, faith is, uh... Faith is what led me to this wonderful place. Um, faith is what we have to have to be one with God. Uh, without faith, we would be lost. Faith is what gets us through. Faith is good... and it's... faith! Um... Um... See, faith is... Faith is great! - Alright, Care Bear... let's make this a daycare. - We have a lot of work to do. To God in prayer - Go get 'em! - I know I've been talking a lot about faith, lately, but, uh, there's a lot of faithless people out there, they need to be more faithful. So, today, let's talk about faith, again! - He's getting better, sweetie. - Faith is... "I love you, dad." "I love you, dad." I love you too, Carrie! Uh, my daughter, she's so sweet. She always puts little things like this in my... my sermons and then, I can't find my notes. So if we could just try to put everything over on this wall. Then, set up the carpet over there. - Sounds good! - You know, there was a funny story about faith that, ah... Wait, there's actually nothing funny, I'm sorry, that was... Wrong story! Um, faith... faith is, uh... It's faith, you know? - This is gonna be amazing! Thank you. - Ooh! And faith is, uh... Don't go. Don't go! - important, folks, because it's... the heart. The heart is so good, uh... And that's why I'm here, right? 'Cause... 'cause we need faith! We... - Ugh! - Thanks for coming. Thank you for com... - God be with you. - Thanks for coming, Judd. - Wow! I broke it, I bought it, huh?! - The roof; It's not gonna fix itself with a tithing so low, right Tim? - No, it'll get fixed by your associates again, Judd. Twice, now. - Nice going! - I'm hoping that your jump shot is a lot better than your preaching. The leg, it's good? Maybe you got some basketball tomorrow? - Oh no, I think... - I'd love to. - Hey, excellent! I've got an idea which you might lead us with in a team prayer. Gotta have a little faith! Ha ha ha! Right?! You seem to know about that, am I right? - Oh, shut it, Judd. The boy is new, we have to give him some time. - Miss Edna. - Mm-hm. - Have a nice day, all. - Thanks for that. - The sermon was wonderful. - Really? - Yes, it really was. - Which part? - Well, the part where you're going to stay with us. - Miss Edna... I'm losin' em, the congregation. - No. No, you will get them back. You will get them back. I want you to have this. To help with your sermons. - Yes, ma'am. - You healed your leg, but I want you to remember that the heart can be healed too. - Yes, ma'am. - Can I take you outside, Miss Edna? - Oh yes, please. - Do you ever get the feeling that something else is happening right in front of you... and you have no idea what it is? - Every day I spend with you, Pastor. Come on. - Let's go. - Come on, Westside! - Come on, Tim! - Oh! Oh! - Oh, for Pete's sake, Tim, you wanna play zones? Cover your man! Get out. Samuels, you're in. Get out. Don't get comfortable, Harper! - I never am, baby, I never am! - Come on! Here we go! - Thank you! - What, what, what?! - Oh! Woah! - Walking foul! - You're gonna do that?! - It's OK, lot of time left. - You guys are pathetic! What, are you made of cardboard?! Stand up like a man... - Judd, I have had enough of your attitude. You need to step off! You need to step out! You're acting like a child! - It's embarrassing out here! - Looks like Judd is speaking his mind. - Oh! If Judd actually spoke his mind, he really wouldn't have a lot to say! - Count it. That's 3 the hard way, baby. Woo! Ha ha! - 'Cause you're a cop, don't think you get away with murder! - Detective, baby! - You're goin' down! - Detective... D-2-3. I got four! Take that! Take that! Let's go! - Knock 'em down! Knock 'em down! Ugh! - Set up! - Gimme that ball! - Judd! I got the court! - What is wrong with you, Samuels, you were wide open! - Why don't you worry about a rebound, sometime, Judd? - You worry about your jumpin', don't talk to me about defense! You wife is porous as a sponge! - What'd you say about my wife? - Porous as a sponge! A sponge! A little tiny sponge! Hey, if I'm wrong, it'd be the first time! - Get that, get that, get that! - Ah! Ball's out! - What are you thinking, Tim? - I wasn't expecting it! - I'm so sorry, that's my bad. - "My bad, my bad"! It's all your bad! Each and every one of you bad! - Come on, Judd, this is supposed to be fun. - Fun? Fun?! This is our first game! We keep playing like this, we're not gonna make the playoffs and that will not be fun. Delay of game! - What?! You're an idiot! Who let you on the court? - Who let me on the court? You know what? You are outta here! - How dare you?! You know how much money I put in this league? You have no right to throw me out, I throw you out. You're gone! You're gone! You're gone! You're gone! - Hey! You call yourself a Christian? Why don't you start acting like one? - You know what, Samuels? You're out of here too; No way you should be leading my church. - Actually, Judd, I'm pretty sure it's not your church. - I put the money into it, I keep it going. If I wanna call it mine, it is, and you're gone!! - No, Judd, you're gone! And your team's gone. - What?! - For the season, you're outta here! - That's it, pal, you're... - Hey! Judd, settle! Judd, the more you struggle, the more it's gonna hurt! Quit struggling, Judd. - Sleeper hold! - Quit struggling or the worse it's gonna be, you hear me? Do you understand? The more you struggle, the more it's gonna hurt! - That is enough! Christopher. - Judd, I'm... I'm sorry. - You just gonna stand there? This... this pastor attacked me! - Yeah, and he kicked your butt. You stink, Judd! - You're done. It's over, Pastor. - Let's go. - You call yourselves a church group?! - Heck of a way to end the game! - Where was a cop when you needed one? - Detective, actually. I'm Ross Harper. - Nice to meet you, Detective. Chris Samuels. - What was that, like, a choke hold you had on Judd? - Uh, it was a sleeper hold. - Oh, it was a sleeper? Impressive skills. - Yeah. - Don't worry 'bout ol' Judd, he had it comin' to him, I'll vouch for ya. Plus, I think a judge was in the stands and saw the whole thing, so... - Small towns! - Welcome to our "small town," Pastor. Good luck with your church. - I don't need luck, Detective. I'll take a prayer. - Yeah. Yeah. - Ah. Where, where, where..? There. Wonderful! Wonderful! You can't believe it? It's not like he was keeping it a secret from us! Judd was spittin' mad; He pulled all his funding from us. We have all these bills in arrears and no way to pay them! Judd, like him or not, was the life blood of this church. - This church existed before there was a Judd and will continue without him. - Well, your house won't exist without Judd; He just withdrew it from church use! We have the utility bills, the... the roof, mission trips that have been booked! - And my organ's on payments; I can't lose my organ! - Look, we'll find a more reasonable place to live and we'll figure out the bills, OK? And, Mrs. Beasley, you'll get to keep your organ. As my wife always reminds me: "The Lord never gives us more than we can handle." Now, let's take a moment and pray... for Him. - Make it a good one, Pastor. - Hey! Sweetie, you wanna take these? - Hi! - How you doin', Ray? Good talkin' with you, Ray. - What's goin' on? - 'Course, we're movin' right next to Ray and Mindy, right? Just random. - They are some of the people that might need us the most. - You OK? - Um... yeah! Just... adjusting to this fine Michigan weather. I'll be fine. - OK. - Why do we have to give away so much of our stuff? - Well, this house is way smaller for what we have. You know, not everyone can afford these things, Carrie. Besides, it's always better to give than receive. - But my bears..? - Sometimes, you have to sacrifice certain things for the better good! OK, Carrie, pick out your favorite bear and we will donate the rest. - OK, Mom. I know someone who would love Mr. Pinkbelly. - Got it! Miss Edna! How are you? - I'm fantastic, and you? - Doin' well! Doin' well! - I just came over to offer some cookies to you and your family, welcome you to the neighborhood. - Thank you. - Mm... Miss Edna, I could smell those cookies from the back! - My husband Dudley always said: "A welcoming is not a welcoming without cookies." Well, Dudley was a smart man! - I wanna know if you'll let me borrow your husband for a couple of hours, so that an old lady could go out for the evening? - Of course, Chris would be happy to help you. - Are you sure? If you're not... - Yeah, I'll feel better once I rest up. You go with Miss Edna and take this to the donation box. Keep Chris out of trouble. - I will, but there's always trouble lurking. Bye-bye! - Carrie, Miss Edna made cookies! - Awesome, cookies! - Miss Edna, here we go! - I really love this music. - Oh, this song? Really? - Yeah... Pastor? - Yes? - You must never judge a book by its cover. - Yes, ma'am. - 'Cause the price you pay I stop and look I felt a voice I heard your cry Through the noise - Miss Edna, what are we doing here? - My husband and I used to love to watch wrestling. - OK, then, OK! - OK?! Welcome to the WFW Wrestling All Star Road Show! The crowd is crazy to see the Reaper in the Main Event, later this evening! Here you go, Miss Edna. - Oh, thank you, thank you! - Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls! Welcome to the home of the world's greatest athletes: The WFW! - Are you cold, Christopher? - Uh, yeah, I just, uh, felt... felt a chill. - In the corner to my left, the Brawler! The Brawler! - Aah! - And in the corner to my right, Titan! Titan! - Aah!! Yaah!! - Ring the bell! - Ah! Aah!! Ah! Aah!! - Do you see how the crowd reacts? He commands this entire room! - I thought it was just because he slammed the other guy into the canvas. I mean, the audience, they just... they just want blood and violence. - The audience wants someone in whom they can have faith. Where did you get this? - Aah! Hmph! - God gave you a gift, young man. - The Lord doesn't love a brawler, Miss Edna. - The Lord loves anyone who fights for what he knows is right. - Yeah, excuse me, I need to... I need to get some air. - Suit yourself, Saint. - One, two, three! Ring the bell! - Ladies and gentlemen... coming to the ring... in the cold steel blue... the king of cool... the Iceman Cometh! - Listen to the crowd boo one of the former heroes of the WFW, the original baby-faced Iceman Cometh! My, how the world has changed! - And now... your worst fears and deepest nightmares have risen. Ladies and gentlemen, the Rrrreaper! - This is it, folks, this is why we're here! In less than a year, the Reaper has become the number one name in the sport and the WFW's most feared opponent. That's 7 feet of deadly, right there. Oh! Over the top rope like it was a road bump! Even if you don't like him, you gotta respect him. - You're on your own. - Oh! The Reaper goes into the turn buckle and a faith breaker! Iceman's little nod to his old friend, the Saint! And Reaper hits Iceman with a sidewalk slam! Oh, that's gotta hurt the man in blue! - Ease up! - Not a chance! - Ooh! - How was that? Ready for another? - Ugh! My back! Take it easy! Ugh! What are you doing?! - Pissin' you off! - No, I tap, I'm out! - Looks like Ice is trying to tap off, but the Reaper will have none of it! - Reaper! Reaper! Reaper! - The crowd wants blood tonight! - There's the Reaper's patented choke slam! It looks like Iceman is done for the night! That slam was brutal! The Reaper's modus operandi is never to let up! Oh no, what's this? The Reaper's going into his leg breaker. - I said no mercy! - Wait! I can't believe this! - Not this time! - It's the Saint! - Who's this? - Good Lord Almighty! Ha! - Hey, hey, hey! Wake up! Wake up! - What is this? Two against one? Bring it on! - Let's do it to him! - This is incredible, everybody! The Saint, back from the dead, and Iceman are tag teaming against the Reaper! I don't even know if this is legal, but if the ref ain't stoppin' it, they're gonna win the battle! - Get him, boys! - Hey! Hey! - This could be it! One, two, three! It's over! It's over! The Reaper has been defeated for the first time in his career! - Ladies and gentlemen, you've just seen The return of the Saint! - Christopher... Ha ha! Welcome home! - This is over, Nicky. You said he'd never wrestle again. - I lied. Reaper's the hottest cod I got in the WFW. After you left, I couldn't get a good guy good enough, you know? A yin and a yang? But you're back, now. You're back and let me tell you something: The fans are gonna love it. Hm, who's my guy, man? - He's not back. - Yeah, you are. You just don't know it yet. You and Ice going in there, two on one; It wasn't a tag team match, it didn't count. Now, pff... if it was like... one on one... Reaper's got a bounty on him... be worth twenty... thousand... dollars. You tell me you're not back. - Uh, oh no... - There you go, Miss Edna. - Isn't it wonderful, Nick gave us all these posters and t-shirts? - I'm glad you had fun. - I did, I did... The world can only be changed by our actions. - Yes, ma'am. - Good night. - Good night, Miss Edna. Lord... please help. Amen. - You gave me strength Oh When the river was too wide Then the sky fell down on my world You gave me everything that I needed To turn my life around - OK, baby! - Bye. - What the hell are you doing, are you praying?! You better be praying 'cause I told you: Stop disrespecting me. - Jojo, I just... AH! - Look at me. If you stop disobeying me, everything will be OK, you understand me, huh?! - Everything doesn't seem OK to me. - Who the hell are you supposed to be, man? Macho Libre?! Halloween was last month, fool, keep walkin'. - Leave her alone. - Man, you don't know who I am or what this is. So I suggest that you walk before I mess you up. - I said... to leave her alone. - Aah!! Ugh! - Miss, are you OK? It's OK. - I will be, thank you! - You need to get off the streets, there's a shelter down the way, I can take you... - I know, I know where it is, OK. I was praying to God for help and suddenly, you were there. - You better go before he wakes up. - Thank you, you're a saint! - No, miss, I'm just a man. Wooh! Yes! Yes! Ooh! OK, OK, OK. - so I went up and, sure enough, she was on the floor and I think she must've hit her head... - Mindy Louise! You get back in this house! Now! - Ray, get back inside and smoke your cigarettes and drink your beer. I will be back when I'm done! - Hey, hey, hey... - Oh, Mr. Samuels, it's Carrie, she came over to my house... - Is she OK? - Carrie's fine, it's your wife. She was found passed out in the bathroom. - Is she at the hospital? Which hospital? - Yeah, St. Mary's, it's on the other side of town. - Come on, come on, Please, Lord. Please, Lord. Please, Lord. Michelle Samuels, I was told she was here, Michelle Samuels... - Daddy! - Carrie! Hey! Hey! Hm! Hey-hey-hey-hey! Are you OK? - I am, but Mom hit her head when she fell. - She... she fell? - Yeah. - Hey! - Hey, beautiful! Are you OK? What happened? - I... I've been feeling lightheaded lately, and... tonight, it just got the better of me. - Wh... what's going on? Well, they... they checked me out and... there's no tumor or sign of aneurism, but... but they did find something else. - What? Michelle, wha... - You wanna tell Daddy? - Mm-hm. I'm gonna be a big sister. What? What? Ah, come here! Mmm! - Better not be a stinky brother! - Hey, what's wrong with brothers? - Oh! Pastor Chris. Good to see you're still here. - Detective, what... what are you doing here? - Apparently, there's a masked vigilante out there beating people up. - You don't say. - Good Samaritan, if you ask me, 'cause he knocked the snot out of our number one hustler. Put him to sleep. Dropped him like a bad habit! - Hope you find your man, Detective. - I always do, Pastor. What are you doing here? - Uh, my wife, she's, uh... She's pregnant! - Congratulations! - Thank you. - I didn't know pastors was allowed to kinda do all that. - We're Southern Baptists. - Is that what it is? Ha ha! Well, that is great news. - Thank you. - I better get on my case in here. - Do you thing, Detective. - Thank you. Good seeing you. - See you. - OK, Jojo... tell me again about this masked vigilante. "Dear Pastor Chris, "this is my journal, "my thoughts, my prayers, "I've had over the years. "I've written them into chapters "based on themes and events "that have happened in my lifetime. "I want you to have it, "not only to help with your sermons, "but also because God has given you a gift, "even if you don't know it yet. "Everyone has to find that out for themselves "and that's why I call this book - - Mastering the Gift." I'm gonna let it shine This little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine This little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine Let it shine Let it shine - Thank you, Mrs. Beasley and the choir. Today... Today, we need help. As you all know, we recently lost some of our funding and... we need the help of all of you. - There's more people here now that Judd's out of the picture. Please! Look, this church... it's stronger or weaker because of every one of its members, not a single person. Now, I keep hearing about the problems the church has. About... how it can't sustain itself. Can't pay its bills. Keep hearing that... roof can't be fixed. Or, there's not enough staff for daycare. Let me ask you a question. Who here... works for a bank? Go on, raise your hand if you do. - I'm with the IRS. - That counts! That counts. Now... who here works in construction? There you go. Who here's a plumber? That's right. Who here... can take care of children in their time off? All right. So now, I ask you: How does this church have problems? How does this church continue to struggle... when, inside its walls, we have the people we need to fix it? Ah, crap! - Now... as I was sayin; - I'm not talking about faith. - Amen! - No, no, I believe we have faith in spades. What I'm talking about is actions, and actions always speak louder than words. I'm... I'm sorry, is there a problem here? - I think I'm the problem, I'm so sorry! No! No, Miss, Miss, wait! Wait! Wait! Come back. Come back... please. Pastor Chris Samuels. - Valerie. - It's nice to meet you. I would like to apologize... on behalf of the congregation... not properly welcoming you to church. Valerie, I'm sorry, it seems that this church is judging you. It's looking down on you. So I'm-a draw a line right here, right now. Anyone who has never sinned, I want you to cross that line. Come on! You were all so quick to condemn her... to tell her she doesn't belong... Makes me sad. But I'm here to tell you folks: We can't keep praying while we sit on our hands. Now... - When you give someone - who will welcome Valerie? - A shoulder to lean on... When you lend a hand - : Come on. Hi, Valerie, I'm Michelle and this is our daughter. - Hi, Valerie! - I'm Deacon Tim McDonald, welcome! - Thank you. - Welcome, Valerie. I'm Miss Edna Clark; Everybody calls me Miss Edna. - Thanks. - You might be insane - I will remember Your name - You might be insane - I never will be the same... - I couldn't believe it. If I wasn't actually there, I wouldn't think it happened. And then, suddenly, he came out of nowhere. - Who did? - This man! It was... You know, Pastor, I went to church as a kid, but I lost my faith. I started praying, maybe a couple of weeks ago when I thought I hit my lowest point and I don't know why. But that night, I was praying again for someone to help, for anyone to help. And he sent me an angel. - You know, Valerie, God doesn't always respond the way we think He should... but He always responds. Well, that, he did, Pastor. - I'm just glad you were able to get in that shelter. And just remember; These church's doors are always open to you. - Pastor Chris, I didn't tell you I'm staying at a shelter. - Uh... Yes, I just... I assumed... - Thank you! Thank you! I have other friends that need help too, would it... be OK if I bring them to your next sermon? The streets dish out all sorts of crazy. The door's always open. I forgot how much kids cost you before they get here. - And afterwards too! Carrie needs new winter boots. - Judd leaving was the reason why I had the congregation to step up in the first place. Valerie arrives, people start coming around, but... the baby? - The Lord never gives us... More than we can handle. - I know. And I believe He's been watchin' out for us, I do, but... we need money, Michelle. I mean; If we can't take care of ourselves, how do we take care of the church? - Because... the Lord... always provides. - Wh-wh-what are you saying? - I am saying that Miss Edna and I think you have a gift. - You've been talking to Miss Edna! - She may have been planting some seeds. - She's a good seed planter. - And this gift... not only do you love it, you are good at it, but it can also provide for our family and the church. - Yeah, but... but wrestling? Where in the Bible does it say: "Thou shalt not wrestle", huh? - I just don't want to be an embarrassment. - You have loved wrestling since I've met you and you have practiced it since you were a kid and if you work hard at something you love and believe in it to the very best of your ability, how could you ever be an embarrassment? You could not embarrass me even if you tried, Christopher Samuels. Now, look me in the eye and tell me this is not a good idea. - What's a good idea? - Well... looks like your dad's gonna get back in the ring one more time. - What?! No way! That's incredible! - Tap out! That's it! - I've seen more meat in a cheese sandwich. - Come on in, guys, come on. - That's why I'm here: To fight. I'm gonna fight for each and every one of you; The faithless and the faithful. Pastor Chris is really good. That's why I'm here; I'm your own personal fighter. Fighter for salvation. Who's gonna fight with me? - Things you just don't see... - Aah!! - Come on, people, who's gonna fight? Hello! - Reach deep inside Deeper than before - Impressive! - Cast out your pride - and it's through faith... that we know God. This faith is why I'm here! You see... you see, I'm a fighter, folks. I know it's getting hot in here, and I know it's 'cause it's the... it's the word of the Lord! - Hey! Where're my girls at? - To break through To break through - Hello, Ray! Hey, Mr. Pinkbelly! - Hi! - Thank you for coming. - Ah, really, anything I can do. - Well, I certainly am proud of the work I've done here. What a glorious congregation I've rallied. And my brothers and my sisters, can I please get - a Amen! - Amen! - Amen. - Amen! - Amen. - Well it's still around me We're just left here standing - One, two, three! Be though my vision O Lord of my heart Naught be all else to me Save that thou art - That's not Mrs. Beasley. - Thou my best thought By day or by night Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light - Mindy, uh... - Pastor Chris. If you don't mind, I'm wondering if Ashley and I could join your church. - Only if you become our new choir director. - What's he on about? - Deal! - Yeah? - Thank you. - Mr. Pinkbelly. - Miss Edna, how are you? - Oh, nice to see you. - Nice to see you. Ah, you know, you asked me to come over, but, uh, I don't really have a lot of time. - I know. You've been a very busy boy since you've gotten back into the ring. - Well, you pushed me back into it. - What exactly did I do? - Well, your book and taking me back to the ring. You know, Miss Edna, I'm running the church now, and paying down its debts and solving everyone's problems. And I work out like a madman every day and wrestle three matches a week. - I've heard that tone in our church before. You know, I've seen Judd sulk back to a few of the services. He stands in the back, where he belongs. - "Where he belongs"?! - Yes, ma'am. - I've heard those words in my lifetime, too. Everyone belongs! Why don't you tell me when you decided to change "we" to "I"? - Excuse me? - "I! I! I! I!" That's all you say. Every time I speak to you, it's "I". - Yes, ma'am. - I don't know why you're in such a hurry. For what, I'm really not quite sure! - Have a good one, Miss Edna. - Yes. Where you been all day? I wanna know where! - I was at the church, Ray! You were... I thought I made myself pretty clear about that church! What is wrong with me going to church?! I don't want you hanging around with that preacher! - Pew! Dad... Dad? Pew! Pew! Dad, you promised! Come on, Dad! Please! We have time for an ice cream before you have to go. Dad... - What? Carrie, instead of thinking about ice cream in the middle of winter in Michigan, just think about your chores. - But, Dad... - Can't you see I'm busy?! - Christopher Samuels... - Oh, what? You too? - Excuse me?! - Look, can't you see what I'm trying to do here? Can't anybody just see? - You just yelled at your daughter for no reason, and now you're yelling at me? Look, I know you're doing a lot, Chris, you're stressed, but we're your family, don't forget that. - I gotta go. I have a match in a couple of hours. Don't wait up. I just said you ain't going - so that means you ain't going! - You know what I... I don't need to give you an explanation! You do! There is nothing wrong with me going! - Oh, there is something wrong! - There's something wrong with that pastor! First of all, there's something wrong with that guy, OK?! And I don't like him! He gets in other people's business! - Ray! - I can get along well without... - Ray! Get out here right now, Ray! Come here! Come here, Ray! Right now! You can be mad at the world, Ray, you can shake your fist at the sky all you want, but your wife and your little girl are trying to connect to something bigger than your hate! Like it or not, they found a home in the church. You should really hear her sing sometime. Mindy's got an amazing voice. - I am broken But I am yours You move mountains So move me, Lord Lord, make me The person I'm supposed to be I am broken But I am yours - Man... - In my weakness - I'm done. - I am yours I bring nothing But I am yours In my weakness I am all yours to transform In my weakness I am yours - Ooh! Hello? - I confess it's been a long time Hello? If you are alone tonight - It's, uh, it's pretty dead in here, huh? - Mm-hmm. Can I, uh, help you? - I confess it's been a long time - Yeah. Double burger... No bun... A large soda, and a side of your fish sauce, please. - Fish sauce? - Yeah, yeah. You know, the stuff you put on the fish. Not ketchup, uh, white... Tartar sauce. Sorry, it's been a long day. - We don't have any tartar sauce. - You're kidding? - I'm sorry, you'll have to come back. - Come back? You know, it's been one of those days where... - Um, I'm... - I'm really sorry about that. - Yeah. OK. Quiet! - OK. Great. Thanks. - Please come back! - Great, Chris. Of all the burger joints of all the county, you just happen to pick the one that's being robbed. Excellent. Brilliant. - Not a word! - OK. - Ah! - Who are you? - The good guy! - Are you OK? Get inside! Call the cops! Lock the door! - OK! Is there anything else you can tell me? - Hmm... no. - You're sure that closed-circuit camera in the restaurant is not working? - No, they haven't been working since my little brothers Lucas and John-John blew them up on Halloween. Yeah, it was a little crazy... - That's OK. I get it. Well, thank you, Emily Anne. - OK. - You have been a great help. - OK. - Yeah. - Hey, Detective... there is one last thing. The guy had a blue binder with a white cross on it when he came in. Do you think that's important? - Well, possibly. If you had told me that in the first hour of questions instead of the third. - Oh! And if you ask me, the guy's a saint for saving us. - Saint or not, he shouldn't be running around town taking the law into his own hands. - I guess you'd be out of a job then. OK, well, I gotta go pick up my daughter. - I've been disheartened So many times Not knowing when - Ooh! It is freezing for ice cream. - Best time to go! - Not busy! - Haha! - Pastor Chris! Look at y'all. Hey, Carrie. - Hi. - Detective. Uh, donuts... - Ain't it a little cold to be eating ice cream? Best time to go! - One more thing. Me and some of the guys are gonna get together and play a little poker tonight. Do you play? - Not really a betting man, Detective. - Me neither. Bad poker face. - The day will come - Better off if I wore a mask. You know, when I was telling you about that masked vigilante at the hospital? - Yeah, you, uh, catch your man, Detective? - No, sir, I didn't. Seems like he struck again though. Saved some couple at a burger joint out of town. They're calling him a "saint." And I wouldn't call him a hero; I'd call him criminal. Ohhh... You know what you want to do when you grow up yet? - Nope. - I got an idea. Why don't you and your pops come on by the station later this afternoon, and I'll show you what I do for a living. - What's that? - Catch bad guys. - Oh yeah? Well, my dad beats them up. - Carrie! Sorry, Detective, I just... - "From the mouth of babes..." So, should we say around four o'clock? - Yeah. - And I'm gonna save you one of these donuts right here. Just for you. Haha! - Right on! That sounds cool! - That sounds cool?! See ya around four, Pastor. You do beat up bad guys for a living. - Yeah.- One-way mirror, cool! - Just like in Hollywood. Just like in the movies. Ah, let me show you something really cool. Bam! Ah, now that's for bad guys. Let me get your daddy over here to take your spot. Chris, just come on over here. Take the little girl's spot. - OK. - What do you think? Looks like a pretty cool bad guy, right? - Yeah. - Ah! Some staff! Come on in, fellas! Help me out for a second. You're really gonna like this. Alright, you're where you wanna be. Wow! That looks like a real police lineup, doesn't it? OK, listen. They can't hear or see you, so you're OK. - OK. - So, I want you to look in there and tell me if you see the man that was at your restaurant. Emily? Do you see him? - No, I don't. I don't see him. - Could you please turn to the right? So Carrie can get a better look at you. Haha! What about now? Maybe number 2? - None of the men are the guy. - You're not even really looking at them. - None of the men are the guy. - You know, lying to a police officer, that's not a good thing to do. - Am I under arrest, Detective? - No, ma'am, you are not. - Like I said before, the man was a saint. - A saint. Yeah, I got it. - Yes. He was. - Hey, Detective! Can I have my donut now? - Sorry, Carrie, we... we're all out of donuts. But I promise that next time you come - and you will come again- I'll get you a whole dozen just for you. Haha! - OK! Let's come back soon! - OK. So... you catch your bad guy? - Not today. - Then I guess we're done here. Come on, Carrie. - Chris! You sure you don't play poker? - I'm positive, Ross. - Do you mind if I give you a little advice that I got from the tables when I was winning? - OK. - Sometimes, it's better to be lucky than good. - Lucky for you, Detective, I don't believe in luck. - Well, luck, God, whatever you believe in. Sometimes, you should just quit... while you're ahead. - Is that a threat? - No, that's just some friendly advice. We're friends, ain't we? - Can I ask you a question? I notice you wear a cross around your neck... you go to church? - Cross belonged to my brother. When he died, I just didn't see no reason to go to church. - A man who believes in luck, but not God... Come by the church; We can talk. Have a good day, Detective. - I'll see you real soon, Pastor. I'll see you real soon. - Hello? Hi, Mom. - Just tell her we're on our way home. - OK, Mom. Mom says, "Don't go home. Come straight to the church." - What happened? - She says, "Only stop for red lights." - What do you think happened? - I have no idea. Let's go, Carrie. Oh, Lord! - Oh, my! Carrie, come here. Sweetie, it's gonna be OK. - Wh-what happened? - I came in to open for daycare, and I found it like this. - We've called the police; They're busy down at the station but they'll be on their way soon. - Pastor Chris, do you know who did this? - This... this is me. This was my fault. - What?! - This isn't your fault, Chris. - Yeah, it is. I need to talk with you. Come here. - Stay with Miss Edna. What? What? What? - Hear my cry Rise crucified - Come on, Carrie, we're gonna go. Let's go. - No, Mommy! I need to help. - Michelle! - Not now. You two OK? - I told her everything. - Hear my cry - What are we gonna do? - We're gonna find the little turds that did this, and we're gonna put the fear of God into them something good! - My friends... I asked you here because... I needed to tell you that I brought this upon us... that I have been so prideful these past few weeks thinking that... that I was the one that led this church, that... that I was the one that got us out of our troubles, that... that I was invincible. But there's only one true leader of this church. And before the Lord, we are not invincible, but accountable. See, I have a confession to make. I've been leading a double life and lying to you all. I wear a mask and wrestle in the ring. And my name there is the Saint. See, I thought wrestling would solve our financial woes. I thought wrestling made me a better preacher... that it made me a better man. But I was wrong. I forgot. I'm fighting God's battle... not my own, that I'm a servant of this pulpit... and not of my fists. I see pride and self-righteousness made me lose my way. For that, I am truly sorry. - Well, that's not good enough! - He lied to us! - More on point, everyone, we can't afford to pay for the repairs. The church simply doesn't have the money. - He should be fired for what he's done! - He didn't do this! Look at the graffiti! These are gang symbols, and the thug that did this is still out there. - You shouldn't even be here, let alone tell us what to do. - Please, look, just... don't let this be the thing that tears this church apart. - In case you haven't noticed, Pastor, our church is already torn apart. - Let Pastor Chris speak! Hasn't he taken us all from where we are to a better place? I know he's done that for me and my family. - And your husband is still drunk at home! - That's enough! I will step down from this pulpit before I let someone talk to one of our members that way. - Well, maybe it's time you stepped down then. - Nobody's stepping down from anywhere! Now, from where I see it, this may be the lowest I've ever seen West Side Baptist. It's not lost on me that it's happened during my absence. But I know you don't kick a man when he's down. The Christian thing to do is, you offer him a hand to help him back up! - Oh, shut up, Judd! - Let the man speak! - Thank you, Mrs. Beasley! You know, a very wise man once said to me, "You gotta have a little faith." I'm all about that. Heck, even my very successful lighting company, Lumpkin Lighting, was once in chapter 11. Mm-hmm. But I kept the faith and I got a second chance. Just like I'm here today asking all of you for a second chance. And if Pastor Chris thinks he can turn this church around again, then I have faith in him. I think he deserves our forgiveness and a second chance. - Our church is still standing, and we have found our leader. - What say the congregation? - It's good with me! Give him a chance! - I think, maybe... maybe Pastor Chris should lead us in a prayer. Yeah. - Looks like you got your second chance, Pastor. - Thanks, Judd. - Now, let's see how you're gonna pay for it. - Could everyone please stand? Dear heavenly Father, give us the strength to continue pushing forward during these hard times and help us remember why you put us here. Help us to use all of our talents for your honor and your glory, not ours. In your name, we pray. - Amen. - Amen. - Please be seated. Mindy? - Guys, let's sing. What a friend we have in Jesus All our sins and grief to bear What a privilege to carry - Just don't get the message, do you, Preacher? - Oh, what peace we often forfeit - Hey. - You came back. - I went home, but... Carrie was a mess. She could not understand why someone would want to do this to our church. - What did you tell her? - I told her that Daddy would handle it. - You believe that? - I believe that the man I saw up on that pulpit was the man I fell in love with, the man I cannot wait to have another child with, because he is a good father... and a good man. - I should have told you when everything started happening. I... I'm sorry, Michelle. - I know. I know you are. You've always been that little boy who's been afraid of the bully, but don't be the bully. - Haha! - You've always been a son who is looking for his father, but now you have to look after the church. You've always been a man looking for a second chance, and now you have one. - Wish I could help you, Chris. - You can. Just say yes. - If I remember correctly now, that Saint had a scheduled appearance that he didn't honor. Therefore, any agreement I have with the Saint, I don't honor it either. - Don't talk to me about honor. This time, I'm asking for this one thing. It's not for me; It's for the church. I want a shot at the title and winning back the belt from the Reaper fair and square. - I say who wins and loses. - This time, you're gonna let me battle it out. Fair fight. There hasn't been a fair fight in pro wrestling since the 70s. - You're gonna make history then. - And what if I just say, "No, Chris," what are you gonna do? Body-slam me? - No... but we are here to audit you. - I'm Lauren Vanderbraun from the Internal Revenue Service. I have several questions regarding your WFW Corporation. - Oh, a cage match, this is gonna be awesome! - Those are my lights. - Pardon? - Those lights, Lumpkin Lighting. A tax write-off. Right, Mrs. Vanderbraun? - Jojo... Enjoy that. Ashley! - Hi, Carrie. - Mindy! Oh, Ray! Oh, it's so good both of you could make it. - Ray had something he wanted to say. - I just wanted to apologize to you, the family, and the church. If it's not too late, I'd like to come to the next service. - It's never too late, Ray. - I really wanted to apologize to your husband as well. - Well, he is getting ready for the fight of his life right now. - Lord, I'm not praying about faith, because I believe in your love and fortitude now more than ever. What I'm praying for is your strength. - I knew that was you at the hospital. See, you took my streets, you took my girl, you took my customers. Ever since you opened up your doors to every crackhead and call girl in this county, you took my livelihood! And I want it all back. - Those people weren't yours to begin with. - So what do you suggest we do, Padre? How do we end this? - Do what Valerie did. Come to church. Seek forgiveness. - Ha ha ha! See, ain't nobody gonna forgive me, preacher man. - You're wrong. There's one who forgives all of us. Even you. - I like you. I do, but I don't think God's gonna forgive me... - Aah! - Ray, wh... What-what are you doing here? - Uh... Well... I came here to apologize. - Well... apology accepted. - The Lord works in mysterious ways. Jojo, Chris, and Ray... Lot of domestics going on at your place, Ray. - Yeah, well, you ain't gonna have to worry about that no more, Officer. I can swear on that. - Detective, actually. - Right, D-detective. - Go on, get out of here, Ray. And don't worry about Jojo. When he wakes up, it's gonna be behind bars. Go on. Folks just keep ending up going to sleep on you, Pastor. - Should I cancel the fight? - I need you to be the last man standing in that cage. - What about, uh... quitting while I was ahead? - Well, sometimes, you gotta go all in. I learned that at the tables too. Hahaha! - Yeah. - Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Nicky Stone and it is time for the main event of the evening! Entering now... the man fighting for the faithful, the one and only Chris "The Saint" Samuels! Ladies and gentlemen, the Saint is unmasked! - You got him, Saint! - The first view of the Saint for the WFW Heavyweight Championship! And his opponent, from the depths of darkness, bringing the battle of good and evil to its knees, the WFW Heavyweight champion! Ladies and gentlemen, the Reaper! Gentlemen, this is for the WFW Heavyweight Championship. Two men walked in; One man walks out. This is it, boys. This is it. It's been a long time for the second coming, Saint. And the Reaper's here to take your soul, again. - I'm coming for that belt. - You'll have to rip it from my cold, dead body. - Your choice. - Yes. - It looks so real! - It's just a show, Carrie. - You forgot one thing, Preacher. - No. - If God's with you, then who will rise against you? Me! - No! Ugh! - No! - Oh no, not again. - We're making history here. - Yeah! This is what the end looks like. - Go, Saint, go! - Daddy! - Come on! - Get up, Chris! Get up! - Gaaah! Yeaaah! Yeah! - Come on, Chris! You can get up, come on! - Stay down, Preacher. Don't let your little girl see you go out like this. What kind of man are you? Stay down, Saint. - I'm not a saint! I'm just a man! Come on! Tap out! There's no ref! - Tap. He's gonna break it. He's gonna break it. - Tap out! - No! No! - You gotta tap. - No! - Tap. - There's no ref, tap! I'm gonna break it. - Daddy won! Daddy won! - Yeah, he most certainly did. - He tapped out! He tapped out! - I have no idea what you're saying! - Ladies and gentlemen, the new WFW champion: The Saint! Good job. - Thanks, Nicky. - I don't want to lose you. - Ha! Come on, take my hand. Take my hand. It's OK. - Give it up one more time for one of the greatest of all time... Christopher "The Saint" Samuels! Dear Pastor Chris, God has given you a gift, even if you don't know it yet. Everyone has to find that out for themselves. But with this gift, you have to keep mastering it every single day. The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing, so go out and do something about it, today. - When you give someone your shoulder to lean on When you lend a hand To lessen the pain When you're suffering yourself You still shield someone else from the rain When the world around you feels like it's crumbling And you wake up with a smile every day When you're empty as hell There's still grace in the words that you say - You might be a saint - I will remember your name - You might be a saint - I never will be the same - You might be a saint - 'Cause when you're near me I'm not gonna break You might be, you might be a saint There's a halo over you When you're doing good There's a ray of light Every time that you give It's not easy to see You're the strength we can be while we live - You might be a saint - I will remember your name - You might be a saint - I never will be the same - You might be a saint - 'Cause when you're near me, I'm not gonna break You might be, you might be a saint So don't give in to the dark clouds around you Be the sun and feel the full-hearted souls That surround you You're the one Every day, people can wash the injustice away - It was you who touched my heart When the world was empty and cold I lay awake in my dreams Praying for a miracle In my life Sometimes my tears turn into rivers of pain And I can't see the stars They're just wasting away You gave me strength - You gave me strength - When the river was too wide When the sky fell down on my world You gave me everything that I needed To turn my life around
