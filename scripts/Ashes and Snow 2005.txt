I remember everything But I do not remember ever having left remember your dreams remember your dreams remember your dreams remember The longer I watch the Savanna elephants, the more I listen, the more that i open, they remind me of who I am May the guardian elephants hear my wish to collaborate with all the musicians of nature's orchestra I want to see through the eyes of the elephant I want to join the dance that has no steps I want to become the dance I can't tell if you are getting closer or farther away I long for the serenity I found when I looked upon your face Perhaps if your face could be returned to me now, I would find it easier to recover the face I seemed to have lost My own Feather to fire fire to blood blood to bone bone to marrow marrow to ashes ashes to snow feather to fire fire to blood blood to bone bone to marrow marrow to ashes ashes to snow feather to fire fire to blood blood to bone bone to marrow marrow to ashes ashes to snow feather to fire fire to blood blood to bone bone to marrow marrow to ashes ashes to snow feather to fire fire to blood blood to bone bone to marrow marrow to ashes ashes to snow feather to fire fire to blood blood to bone bone to marrow marrow to ashes ashes to snow The whales do not sing because they have an answer. They sing because they have a song. What matters, is not what is written on the page, what matters, is what is written in the heart. So burn the letters And lay their ashes on the snow At the river's edge When spring comes and the snow melts And the river rizes Return to the banks of the river And reread my letters with your eyes closed Let the words and the images wash over your body like waves Reread the letters, with your hand cupped over your ear Listen to the songs of Eden Page, after page, after page Fly the bird path Fly Fly Fly
