Unfortunately, there's nothing else for it. - But what about the board? - Let's wait until the end of the month. What if we go multi-manager? Marcos? The situation is very serious. From now on, you're just shareholders. Hi. Hi. How are you? Good, and you? Not so bad. When are you thinking of going? I don't have to. They can get by without me. I think you should, at least for a few days. Giulia, right now, I can't pass the fund overto another manager. Hello? Hello Marcos? It's Tiago. - Giulia. - Nice to meet you. Tiago. Let's go? Have you told anyone? I told uncle Dante. He and Moreira will tell whoever else is necessary. This is Bibi. Can I come in? So you've decided to stay here then? - Do you mind? - No. I think it's a good idea. I'll sort this out as soon as... as soon as I cool off a bit, R. Right, but don't mess about, this could be dangerous. No, I promise. Fair enough, see you tomorrow, then. - Okay, talk to you later. - Sure, see you. - Thanks R. - Sure, bye. Bye. Look what I found. You still have yours? What? Lost it, didn't you? I think I lost it the same day she gave it to us. Look at that, Mr. Armando. Such a shame you didn't get a chance to see yourfather again. He would have loved to see you. - I'm sorry, Tiago. - Thanks Moreira. - Marcos? - Yes. My name's Osvaldo. I'm a doctor. I knew yourfatherfor many years. Thanks for coming, Osvaldo. He shared some very important matters with me... this took me by surprise. This is my number. Call me when you can talk. What's it about? It's a very serious matter. Call me, please. Who's that? Afriend of Armando's. He built the Berrini building. And having sold almost everything before completion... he bought another eight plots with the same loan. Eight. This was in July, you can imagine the rest. Well, what's done is done. Have you thought of a solution? I'm Armando's lawyer, but the company's yours. No. It's Tiago's, Moreira. And from what I can see, he's been paid very well to run the business. But you need to run the company together, he can't do it on his own. I'll be in my office if you need me. Do you like kids? Kids. - Kids? - Yeah. Very much. Do you and Marcos want kids? We don't talk about it. Maybe later... in the future. I've never understood why he never came back to Brazil. We kept growing further apart. Lost the habit. - Hello? - Doctor? - I'm on my way. - Ok. Take a seat. He'll be with you in a moment. Marcos, thanks for coming. I hope you've got proof. - Calm down. - I am calm, but... Loweryour voice, please. She's right overthere. Let's talk in my office? It's all there. Your sister was admitted two years ago. How old is this girl? the mental age of a child. Yourfather had Manuela admitted here provisionally... after Ana, her mother, died. She had a long period of attacks and yourfather couldn't cope. Marcos, what I'm about to say, I've been telling Armando for a long time. Manuela's problems no longer require internment. You are herfamily. You have to look after her. - Can't she stay here? - I can't keep her here anymore. Why not? Because she needs to be reintegrated into the family... otherwise she'll regress. - And if I pay... - This is the clinic's final position. Hello? Hello, Marcos? Hi Giorgio, how are things? Good and you? We're fine. The reaction to the merger was not good. Shares fell 12% today. The forecast is for a further fall tomorrow. The market is overreacting, Giorgio. I think ourfund should buy. I can't do that on my own, you know. You have to come back, I need you here. Alright, I'll see what I can do about the tickets. Okay, I'll wait for you. - Right, take care. - See you soon, then. - Bye, bye. - Bye. Hi. I'm in a meeting, I can't talk now. Call me as soon as you're finished, I need to talk, urgently. All right, I'll call you later, then. - Ok, bye. - Bye. - Hi. - Hi. Sorry I'm late. How did it go today? Tough. Have you confirmed the flight? All done. Are you okay? Is everything ok with the company? I think there's a solution. We'll see if my brother and Moreira are up to it. Have you changed your mind? I'm tired... Come here then. Your bag looks like a Pollock painting. You need some help? Yes, thanks. - Good morning. - Good morning. Sorry I didn't call you yesterday, therejust wasn't time. So Tiago, I'm leaving tomorrow. We need to talk. I understand. I suppose you know the state the company is in. Of course. And have you been talking to Moreira about this? We decided to sell three plots to solve the debt problem. It's not as simple as that, Tiago. I know, but it'll work out. Can't you stay a bit longer? Another week? I can't. I have to get back. It's in your hands. Tell Marcos to call me before you leave. Have a nice trip and let me know as soon as you arrive. Sure. I have to hang up now. Okay. A kiss. A kiss to you too. Bye. Right, but what do you want me to do? I live here, but it's not just my problem, it's ours! And I'm not going to do a fucking thing. - Stop being childish... - Me, childish?! You're the one leaving! Anyway, I don't believe it! It's true, I've checked it. - I don't give a damn! - We have to deal with this, Tiago! I don't give a damn! What was that about? Nothing. Achildish tantrum. Yourturn, Tiago. I'm out. Five grand. Five and I'll raise you two. I'll go with seven. I'll see you. Two pairs. Three Jacks. I don't know why you still bother coming here. I'll be back in a minute. Andr, your deal. Giovanni, the game's turning in my favor. I had a problem just then, but... You've already run up over 300 grand. Three hundred thousand! You want to get me in trouble with Rodriguez? No, no, you don't need to say anything to him. Relax, I'm sorting out the inheritance, I'll square things with you guys. Unless you square something now, you're not leaving here. Get it? Hello? Good evening, can I speak to Mr. Marcos Bonelli. Tiago? Shit! We monitorthe patients' rooms during the night. Fortheir safety. Just picture. No sound. Look at this. What's that in her hand? It's a photo. Can I see the photo? Mr. Marcos? Mr. Marcos? She's awake now. Do you know who I am, Manuela? I'm Marcos. This one here. Daddy spoke about you. What did he say? That when he couldn't come here... to see me anymore, my brother Marcos would visit me. This is my letter, which is the same as that of my older brother, my brother Marcos. When he can't come to see me anymore, my brother Marcos will visit me. What are you doing here? Why did you come? When he can't come to see me anymore, my brother Marcos will visit me. Because he can't come here to see me? Why? He's not coming back? - Why? - No. Because he's on that beach. And he's going to stay there forever now. He won't be coming back, Manuela. Manuela. Don't cry. I'm here to visit you, like he said. Aren't I? It's all right. It's all right. M - We missed ourflight. - I know. I've been calling you and your brotherfortwo hours! - Giulia... - I was about to call the police! - I'm fine. - But you can't imagine... - Nothing happened! - Where were you?! I have a sister I never knew existed, the daughter of my father's lover. She's mentally ill and interned in a clinic. That's where I was. Yeah Moreira, Moreira... This isn't the first time. How many times did Armando send you here? He's just lost his father, Giovanni. I'll advance part of it foryou, ok? My patience is over. Tiago, do you hear me? Tiago, look at me. Between you and me, I'll go with me. Eitheryou pay... oryou pay. Orders? Whose orders? I can't pay out amounts over five thousand, Mr. Tiago. Not to anyone, it's notjust you. Fine Janana. Just tell me who gave the order. I think you should talk to your brother. Marcos... Marcos! Oh Bibi, come here. Here. No one fed you, did they? Where's Marcos, huh? You know, Marcos, life is like golf. There are some shitty clubs out there that make the caddies swim... forthe lost balls at the end of the day. Here, we leave the balls where they fall. Each ball in its place. That way there's no shame. Marcos, my boy, I knowthat yourfather left you with some serious problems. And I can help you, your brother and thatjerk Moreira sort things out. Youjust have to leave the dud balls where they are. Preserve the family. You understand what I'm trying to say? You'rejust going to throw everything out, without looking through it? Aren't you even going to tell your brother? Tiago doesn't give a shit. Mr. Bonelli, good evening. Please contact Mr. Giorgio Maranza. Thank you. I've been thinking... of course, if it's alright with you... I'd like to keep the house. It's yours, Tiago. Whatever was his, is yours. And yours, right? I passed by the office today. Good. You can't go on spending what the company doesn't have, ...just so you don't end up losing the house. I might look stupid, but I'm not. Your cell-phone was ringing. Thanks. You two sure look glum. I thought we were going out? You'd never guess you hadn't seen each otherfor centuries. So, let's go? Tell him. She says she thinks we should... I understood. I didn't understand, but I understood. A little air will do us all some good. I think it'll be good... if we go out. Hi. What happened? Did you fall down the stairs? You've got to be careful with those guys, you know? I'm not a kid, understand? I can take care of myself, okay? Aguy earns some money, then he disappears. First-rate cocaine. No. What do you mean? It's the best. - Cut it out, Tiago. - Hey, take it easy. Tiago stop it. I'm talking to you Tiago. Tiago, cut this shit out. Are you nuts? Are you nuts, man? Are you crazy? - Tiago, stop! - What did you do that for?! Marcos! Marcos! - Are you nuts, mate?! - Tiago. Leave it. Let it go, Tiago. Are you crazy?! Look at me. Look at me. Calm down. - Hello. - Marcos? Hi Giorgio. I waited the whole day yesterday for you to call me. Can you hear me? I can't wait any more! I have to schedule a meeting with the people from IGS for next week... and I need you here, Marcos! Right. Let me talk to Giulia. It's foryou. Dad. Giulia, what's going on over there? I don't know dad, things are pretty confused. Who's that? You know? No, you don't. I do, it's dad. Dad. This one is... Tiago. - Tiago. - Yeah. Tiago does nothing, but he's a really nice boy. Marcos is smart, he's away travelling, but he'll be back soon. The photo of dad wearing glasses. It's funny, so many people. Don't be sad. Want to go for a ride in the car? Let's go? Dear brothers and sisters. Perhaps no human suffering compares to the pain of losing a loved one, especially when there are deep bond of affection and identification. The strongerthe bond, the greater will be the pain and suffering of the separation. We are gathered here today a week after his passing whose departure we now commemorate. This is Giulia. For us Christians, death is not the end... it is but a threshold to eternal life. Today we come together to remember him who, though no longer amongst us, lives on in our hearts. I would like to ask you all to observe a minute's silence - Manuela, quiet now... okay? ...in the memory of Armando Bonelli. Let's say a prayerforyourfather. Like this, see? Let's go outside, come on. Let's go outside. What were you thinking? In case you didn't notice, uncle Dante wasn't pleased. I don't care about uncle Dante. Right. So now you're going to take this girl with you whereveryou go, hand in hand? She obviously can't stay on her own. Can you understand that? You can't. You've always had dad, the housekeeper, a dog, a swimming pool. You don't have a clue what it means to be alone. You spent your life alone because that's what you wanted. That's what I wanted? Not like that, Manuela. Inside. Come on. Let's go? Let's go? How was it, Manuela? Have a nice time? It was great. - Have fun? - Yes. So we'll do it again soon? OK? - Bye. - No, come watch television. No, I have to go home now, Manuela. I'll come back and we'll go on another outing. Come on, dinnertime now. Let's watch television... - there's a really good show on! - Manuela, come on now. No, no! - Manuela. - Let me go. - We need your project... - I'm doing what I can, Marta, but it's really difficult here. I'll organize things and see what I can do. We can't delay this presentation any longer. I'll call you later. - Bye. - Ok, bye. Hi. I'll explain later. Remember Giulia? Bibi? Hey Bibi, hey Bibi, I missed you, Bibi, my pal Bibi... Good night. What's the matter? What's the matter, Manuela? I can't sleep. Come. Give me that. This stays with me now. Ever played cards? You know what this is? This is a disease. Once you learn, you can never stop. Except you're not going to learn, because you're a half-wit. No, no. Hey. This game here is called patience. You play alone. Of course, you have to knowthe cards, you have to know howto count. I can count, you can't. Giovanni son of a bitch. Sit down before it gets cold. I have a meeting at the company this afternoon. Can you stay with Manuela? Thanks. I need to talk to you. Right, but not now, I have to go. We'll talk later. My life is not a company matter. Not while yourfather was alive. Things are different now. You had to open your big trap, didn't you Moreira? Son of a bitch. - You were being threatened. - Threatened, man? Excuse me. Son of a bitch. I don't know how you're going to pay your debt, or save the business. And I don't know howto get it into your head that you risk losing everything! And can't you help? Aren't you rich, Marcos? So what's the problem, man? You don't get it, do you? I can't bankroll your gambling. Even if I could, I don't want to. That's all I need. A bankrupt company on the one hand and a dependent brother on the other. Amongoloid daughter doesn't count, then? - Fuck you, Tiago! - Dad's pair of strays. One went to boarding school, and now... Shut your mouth, because I have had just about enough of you. You said everything you wanted, didn't you? But you don't tell me what to do. Now you, Moreira, or whoeverthe fuck... can call Janana and tell her to give me money. I'll take the responsibility. And don't you go off to Italy and leave me here with the retard. I'm not going to look after her. I don't give a damn, nor does uncle Dante. But someone is going to have to know. And we have to find a solution. But she was fine at the fucking clinic! I sawthe site, even I wouldn't mind living there. Enough of thejokes. Grow up, fuck it. This is serious. Do you know howto look after her? Because I don't! No one here does. She's a retard, that's why she should be in there. - She can't stay there. - She's a halfwit, Marcos. She's our sister. Period. I'm leaving tomorrow. I have to go back. If you want to come, there are still seats on the flight. I'm sorry, but I can't leave now. It's beautiful what you're doing foryour sister. I imagine I'd do the same. I just keep asking myself... where this desire to take care of someone came from, all of a sudden. YOURTIME IS UP. WHERE'S MY MONEY? Jerk. Bye. My father still doesn't know anything. You explain it to him. - Hello. - Hi Giorgio, it's Marcos. Right then, I'll arrange a part for you now. - I'll be there in fifteen minutes. - No, come right now. - Let mejust take this call. - All right, I'm waiting. Okay. Bye. Bye. Hello. Hello. Tiago. Your number's up. You're hurting me, man! - You're a sniveling idiot! - Giovanni! Hang on a second, Giovanni. - Hang on a second, Giovanni. - No, you hang on! - Let me explain something to you. - You're going to pay me now, ortake a beating like you'll neverforget, you worm! Yes, I know... And Davide's attitude strikes me as right out of line. Hang on, I'm busy, Manuela. Not now, Manuela. What's up? Enough of this screwing around, fuck it! What the? - Stay inside. - Let me go! Today you're going to take a bullet in the head. I was on my way to get the money right now. - That's what you always say! - What's going on here?! - Take it easy. - Who are you? I'm his brother. Let's talk. Put down the gun. Oh, his brother, I don't want to talk, I want my money. How much does he owe you? Let me sort this out. I'll get the money foryou. Where is it? I need two days. - Two days. - Seriously. I live abroad. Do I look like an idiot to you? I'll give you what I've got here. Slow. Slow. Go. Hey, I want to see those hands. Slow. I have 6 thoousand. This is my guarantee. You've got two days. Let the kid go. Two days! Marcos. Thanks. It's okay. Come inside, come? The cat. The cat had supper. - Where is the cat? - The cat is in the bush... Where is the cat? The cat is in the bush. Where is the bush? The bush the fire burnt. Where is... Where is the ox? Sleep, sleep. Sleep, sleep. Mammy's little pet. Sleep is on its way. Daddy's little pet. Sleep, sleep. Sleep, sleep. Mammy's little pet. Sleep is on its way. Daddy's little pet. Giulia, can you hear me? I want to say I'm sorry for everything that's happened here. I knowthat sometimes I don't show it... But you are very important to me. Giulia, say something. Miss, please, your cell-phone... I'll be back soon, okay? Don't be long. I won't. What? I love you. Me too. Let's go for a ride? Let's go?
