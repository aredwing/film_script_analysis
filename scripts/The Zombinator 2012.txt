She can always see more than what most people see when she looks at something. I wanna go with that. - Mhmm. - I can go with that. Very, um... wow. Yeah, creative. Stubborn. - Yeah, there you go. - I'm a Taurus. She can be very stubborn. - A Taurus and... - And a perfectionist. It has to be perfect and it... - It, it has to be perfect. - Yeah. What do you guys think about Joanne and her, um, you know, involvement with frockOn and... writing, spending so much time writing on a fashion website, fashion blogging? Well, you know, it, it's a fabulous opportunity for her. It just unbelievable what, what doors can get opened up for her, what she can do now. Edie Sedgwick is like my fashion inspiration. She is amazing. I wish she was still alive. Um... And she's my fashion inspiration because she, like, pushed the limits, like, more than any person that I can even think of. So, this is my first time in Youngstown and, uh... I hear there's like a lot of, uh, you know, murders here. Like, unsolved murders and... I mean, the area's really revitalizing a lot, gentrifying. Um, trying to, I guess forget about that history. Okay, what's it like outside? Murder-y. It's, uh, it's... I'm so glad... It's crisp. I'm so glad that my film crew is planning a murder video on my day. Do this on your time! This is why the murders happen. It's uh... Youngstown, it's uh... It's a self... it's a auto-suggestion thing, You just say the word murder in Youngstown, and people just become paranoid and then they start murdering because they heard it. And it's just like, it's inner prophecy thing that just... Where are some of the weirdest places you guys have seen bullet holes? Uh, in a church bathroom. Uh, in a car. It used to be mostly on the south side, but now it's kind of... it's sort of happening, when you were saying they were gentrified, it's more of like, civilized murder now. It's less like bullet holes in a windshield, and it's more like "Where is that guy?" It's like this disgruntled cesspool of like... uh, repression... Wow, I really like it here. Youngs... Youngstown... well then there's the train, there's always the train. There's this one murder that... Like there's a set of train tracks that like... I think this guy used to be like some kind of train operator or something like that and like... when the train sort of like shut down, he couldn't handle it, so he like, kind of lives at the train track, like at the old B & O station and he kind of like... That's where like multiple killings have been, but they've never found him, so the fact that they never found him, like... Nobody, it adds the mystery. Like... So he's still out there? - Apparent... - Murdering? And well, nobody really knows. That's the, that's the thing of it is like, "Oh, that's the train track... " and it's half fact, half fiction, and if you ask the police station, like, they won't give you... Like, the media doesn't really say, it was this guy or it wasn't this guy. - But he used to be... - And they know who he is? No, cause they can't find him. All they find are dead bodies at the train tracks. So this is like a half mile away from my house, right down the road. And this is, I mean, it's an awesome place. I love the look and the rustic feel and everything of it, but it's where a lot of murders have happened, and it's extremely... sad. Creepy, definitely creepy. Yeah, but I like it. I mean, it's, it's pretty. I mean, it's a shame that nothing has ever... been done about the place, like no one's ever cleaning it up or anything, like the rest of... Everyone's getting murdered cause they come down here. Right, I mean it's... And people have disappeared here. It's not, I mean it's not safe. I mean, I could see people disappearing and getting murdered here though, definitely, like at nighttime... - Well, yeah... - You have to like... Who's gonna hear anything with all the cars. - And nobody's around... - Well, hunting gunshots, so it sounds like a... Yeah, there's gunshots right now, I mean, but they're... suppose... supposedly, what you keep in the back of your head is that they're just hunting, but who knows? Yeah, that's not so reassuring. But it sucks because everybody thinks it's terrible, it's really not that bad, but I guess it's just cause... - ... this is all we know. - We're used to it. - Yeah, really. - This is all we know. Definitely has some potential though. There are some beautiful places here. Yeah! I know, I mean you see like in Vogue and stuff, people are all doing photo shoots on railroad tracks, and then these rustic, country side areas, they go to like Baton Rouge... like, no, come the fuck to Youngstown. There's lots of space and you know, Yeah. I like it, and I mean, I don't know, it's kinda... It's just pretty. You guys see that? See what? No, I'm not freaking you out. I mean, I really did just see like a person... It's not a person. No, I do see something. Where? Over there, like by the pillars. Did you see anything? Oh my God. Holy shit. Did you see that? Please tell me you saw that. - Are you scared? - Come on. I don't think that's a good idea. Why? What are you talking about? Are you scared? I'm not scared. He's the one scared. You're the one who saw it. I know I did, but I don't... Are you serious? Oh, what the fuck? Oh my God. What is that? Is that blood? You're the one who saw it. I know I did, but I don't... No, no. It's probably just like some teenagers doing some stupid shit, shooting up, getting some blood on their hands, rubbing it on the... "Argh. " So I mean we have a party to go to tonight. I, I know this is fun and great Mr. Camera Guy, but I mean we need to go get ready for the party. - So, let's get out of here. - Yeah, let's go. Yeah, that totally looks like real blood. Yeah. Dude, that's real blood. Lick it, dude. No. No way. There's no way, I'm not... I didn't come here. I didn't sign... I'm not licking crap off a pillar in Zombieland. No, I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that. That's disgusting. Lick it dude. You wanna pay me? I bet you it's deer, deer blood though, that some hunter did. Will you give me a... Real blood but deer blood. I'll give you a dollar. A dollar? I'll double it. Okay, a dollar! Get your tongue in there dude, yeah. Do it, do it. At least smell it. Oh my... Yeah, you just got deer herpes, bro. Shut up, man. Holy shit. What it taste like? Cough syrup? Oh my God, I haven't seen you guys in so long. Joanna! - How are you? - How you been? - Hey! - You guys look great. - You look amazing. - Look at you.

I've been really busy, I'm sorry. - ... we glad that you... - You look, you look great. - Thank you. - Yeah. I'm not into fashion, though. I'm into arts. Are you, I mean are you a model or anything? I go to art school, but I do a lot of projects in the city. We should like get together cause she's a dancer, we should like do a project together... Do you design at all, like if you're into art? I didn't do design, I like painting though. - Oh really? - Painting is my thing. That'd be really cool to, you know, like... I like talking to college students and seeing like what they're doing, like what their goals are and write a little article about it. We should definitely get together. - Yeah, we should do that. - Yeah. Do you come to the city a lot? Uh, a little bit, yeah. That's where we're based in, so I go every so often. That's cool. Yeah, we'll exchange information. And she should come and join us right? Yeah, I'm down for anything. I'm like, I love fashion. I love fashion. Please girl, I can do a fashion show for you. A joke? No, like a real one, I mean. It's funny, but it's real. Oh. It's actually like gonna happen. I'm in Cleveland right now, me and my girl. - Oh really? - Yeah. Yeah. What do you do there? Uh, I work at a coffee shop but I'm getting fired cause I'm not coming home tonight and I have to be there at 6am. So I don't have a job, which is awesome. So that's why you should come to the city. Ahh! Let's go to the city! Let's do it. I love this girl. So guys, how about this? - Did you just meet her? - Yeah. So basically after the wake, after we spend time here, we all go to the city. - Yeah. - How 'bout that? Yeah, I'm down. I've never actually been to like a bigger city before. - Come with us. - No? I mean... no, I, I just haven't had to go. I know, I never brought you before, you should come. - Yeah. - You should come, man. - Chase us. - I mean yeah, if you want. - You come? - Yes. I didn't even get a drink. What is this? Oh um, anybody got a drink? Hey what's up, this is Ken. How you doing, it's Jed. And we're just basically here for, um, Bobby's wake. Um, I was a freshman in high school, he was a senior so... Yeah, and they played on the basketball team, I didn't really know the guy but... I didn't know him that much, but you know, I knew him a little bit before he went to war though, he seemed like a pretty awesome guy. - Yeah? - Pretty awesome guy. I mean I... like I said but, it's nice that since we can all work together and honor what seems to be a great man... I think it's an honor to be here though, I think it is. - It's still a great honor. - Yeah, definitely. - Um, let's toast to Bobby. - Yeah. What's, what's with all the cameras? Oh um, did you meet Joanna? No. It's one of Joanna's friends with the party and they're doing a fashion documentary with her... Wow. You guys realize this is a wake, right? That's interesting. If you're gonna do a documentary on anybody, you gotta do on my man right here, The Colonel. He brought Bobby's ashes back. Like, look right here, he brought, he brought the ashes back, my boy Bobby, and I mean this is, this is the real deal right here. This is a war hero. I mean, it's The Colonel, dude. I'm just... I'm just doing my job. Let's focus... Did you know Bobby? Um, I actually didn't. Um, Marcus... I'm really good friends with Marcus and I'm here just, you know, being with him and you know, making sure that he's okay through all this so... I'm sure he'd appreciate you being here... Yeah, absolutely. I'm sure you do. He's a lovely boy. We've been friends since we were kids so, um, you know, I have to only be here for him. Me and Bobby were really cool, you know we played, we played ball together and stuff like that. What positions did you play? Well, I was tailback. - Oh, nice. - He was always the Q. I mean, he had an arm. I mean I just, you know... Sad to see him go. I'm sure, you all seem like lovely kids, he would really appreciate that you're here to honor him and uh, uh... I'm just really gratified by how just warm and nice you've all been. You know, they talk about the greatest generation, but I really believe that this is the greatest generation, and Bobby was a member of that and he was a terrific soldier. Uh, it's my honor and privilege to have served with him in Afghanistan, and I just, uh... I think he's emblematic of young people who've put their lives on the line for their country and um, I hope that everybody appreciates that. I certainly appreciate you all being here. Well said, well said. I, I'll toast to that. Absolutely. - Cheers. Cheers. - Cheers. I'm sorry that we ended up just... showing up. But it's great to, to learn about such an amazing hero. Well, I know Bobby always appreciated lovely women. He wouldn't have minded your presence, I'm sure. It seems like he has a great family, we've really been welcome. Yeah. Thank you. Well, I'm so sorry that he's gone, I really am. - He's a good dude. - Yeah. He's a really good guy. You're so modest man, but... I mean you're doing the thing, man. You and Bobby, just going out there, protecting us. Man that's, I mean, that's what it's all about, like I'm, I'm just glad that, that you're here. You know what, Joanne? I know, you know, that you're doing your fashion thing and everything, but... this documentary should be about Bobby, and you know, or The Colonel, about Bobby most of all. So like right now, let's all do a toast for Bobby right now, all right? Raise your glasses. Uh, Bobby was my boy. You know, I knew him growing up, we played ball together, he was a stand-up dude. And um... I'm crushed to see him... see him go, and uh, yeah. For Bobby, all right? For Bobby. All right. That was really nice of you, Marcus. - Yeah. - Well said, yeah. If you'll excuse me for a moment. Okay. Nice meeting you. Nice meeting you. Bobby was the catch. He was on the volleyball team... "Protea" ] The band was really good. Yeah, they were amazing. I love their, their like, costume. - Yeah. - ... whole costume, perfect. Dead 2 Me. It's so... I think like, they, they knew Bobby too, right? - Yeah, I think he liked that... - They knew Bobby? Yeah, I mean he's... they're from here so they probably were friends. - Yeah. - Nice. - They're good. - And they're fantastic. Yeah. Are they signed? I don't think so, I think they're just local. - Just local. - Yeah. You know, I'm like ready to go Marcus, I don't know. I just... there's something like weird about this place, Stay like another 20 minutes, then we'll get outta here and do something else. I don't know but I'm telling you, I really need a cigarette right now. A cigarette? - When'd you start smoking? - I don't... I just... I don't know, I'm a little stressed out, you know. So you're gonna get a cancer stick, that's what you're gonna do? I guess, I mean you know what? It is what it is... We're at a wake and you wanna get a damn cigarette?

Whoa whoa whoa, wait wait. Wait. Ken Ken Ken, dude. Jed, what's wrong? You sure that... You sure that that's the right door? Cause there's plenty of other doors in here, right guys? Maybe we should take a... like a general consensus. Guys, it's better than being out here, just go in. Trust me. Trust me, Jed. Watch your step. What the hell. This is kinda cool. What is that? A cross. Oh no no... Where are we? I feel a presence. Oh what the fuck is this? Oh what now? No no. This is the wrong door. What's over there? - Ah shit. - What is that? Ah shit.

Don't tell me to fucking relax, there's fucking zombies upstairs, dude. I don't, I don't like this. Let's just go back and try a different... - No, I wanna go outside. - Guys, I don't like this! Something isn't right! - Just calm down. - No, I just wanna... Nina, I just wanna go. Can we please just go? No, I left Bob! I left Bob alone. He needs me. He won't eat without me. I gotta go! Who's Bob? I have to... just let me go! Look, I have pictures. Tell them, Nina! I have pictures. I can't leave him alone! A zebra? Really?

Zombies don't talk, guys. Hold on. - Hello? - Hello. Hello? Who are you? There's people back there. - Who are you? - Who are you? Go, they might be hiding from... All right, come on, guys. Guys, it's Ghostbusters. Ghostbusters? Yeah, that, that's what they said. Hello? Fucking Ghostbusters. - No. - No. We're the Collective Paranormal Research Society. We're on investigation. Who the hell are you? We're just college students. College students? Yeah, we were stopped by zombies. Zombies... ...fucking zombies. It's not a fucking game! We were asked, we were asked by the homeowner, or the building owner to come in and do an investigation. We deal with paranormal, we don't deal with like the whole zombie folklore kind of stuff. I mean, we're... You know what? We need to unite, okay? This is really not the time to be fighting over stupid shit like who's a zombie, what's a ghost, you know, what's real, what's not real. We just saw a girl get bitten. And like honestly, what's up with all these damn cameras? We just keep drawing freakin' more attention, just keep it up, why don't you just shut that shit off? - Honestly. - Seriously. That's a good ass fuckin' idea, turn that shit off. Turn that shit off, man. You guys have no idea what's going on outside, all right? - They don't. - Trust me. We just need to band together. We've been down here for hours and we haven't heard one word or any... There's walking corpse outside. Well don't you think that we have the kind of equipment to be able to hear these kinds of things? Please help us. Just tell us how to get out. We have to get away. We're being chased. Guys, you think we making up shit right now? How did you... 'How did you get in?' is the first question. Yeah, the owner... Cause this place was locked up. We've been here, again, for the past four hours. There's walking corpse outside. Maybe the zombie unlocked the door. How does a zombie unlock a door? Listen there's a lot of shit that's going on that's unexplainable right now. We don't wanna argue with you, we're not joking around. I, I understand. Really? You guys are the skeptics? The paranormal team is the skeptics? As far as I'm concerned, you're contaminating our equipment. I mean, we have nothing here that's saying that... We have the right stuff to say if zombies exist, or if there's any kind of noise going on outside. It seems like you've done, you know, well enough yourself so far. You just stick to a group, I'm sure you'll be fine. But again, we don't deal with zombies. - Hey, guys... - Hey, guys! The spike's getting a reading. Hold on, everybody be quiet. We are getting a spike over here. Something's... something's around. Something coming through, basically. all right, do we have anybody here with us right now? Do you not like that there's so many people here right now? Get out. Right there. He just said, "Get out. " Are we scaring... is... Are we scaring you? "... his skill set is" We got "skill set", and it went through five frequencies in that time period. How many of there are you? Seven. Seven. - Fuck. - Whoa. You know what, this is not safe. We have nowhere to go. No you are safe here, we have, we have priests. - No, we're not! - We have priests here. We're not joking... Our... let me, let me introduce you to two people, we have Father Delroy and Father John. Why do you have priests in here? Why are they smoking? Perhaps... Our priests are trigger objects. They're our trigger objects and you know, we can't really protect ourselves from demons. We can wear metals, but they're not, you know... It's not, doesn't give us the same protection as having a priest with us. Guys... We have other people here, and other sources of protection just in case that we come across some kind of contact - like maybe you guys... - Hey guys... Frankie, it's over here. You guys hear that? Shh... Father John, Delroy... would you guys maybe come over here and check this out? all right, one second please. One second. ...throw away my cigarette. Ya, mon. Seriously guys, do you hear that? - Yeah. Shh shh... - There it is. - There it is. - Shit. What the heck? - Everybody quiet. - What the... Shh shh shh... I haven't heard that... Guys, I'm getting readings all over the place. I've never heard anything like that before. You gonna get the shot? Come on, it's them! Y'all thought it was a game, huh? Thought it was a game huh? - Yeah. - It's been forever. ...ghosts this loud was at... Why y'all going toward... Jo, Jed, where are y'all? It's right above us. Why y'all going towards this shit? It's our job. We go towards what we're scared of. Father! Calm down. Guys, calm down. Check out over there. Go towards the back, go towards the corner. I think it's... No, it's okay. The priests have everything under control. Why are they screaming? The priests have everything under control. Sometimes it takes a lot out of them... Please just stand back, everything's okay. We need to relax. We do this all the time. Listen, I don't feel like... Jed, Jo, where are you? There's nothing to be afraid of guys, I promise. Could just be a malevolent spirit, that's all. They can make noise. It's okay. This is not ghosts! - This is something... - Yeah, it's something else. Yeah, there's no possible way it could be zombies. You haven't seen... - Go upstairs! - It's okay. Just calm down. ...see what's going on there. Why don't somebody go check that shit out? You guys, everyone, everyone... This is ridiculous, okay? We're adults, okay? - Yeah. - Right, exactly. She's going. So, I'm just gonna go see what's going on. - What? No, you can't. - No, Nina! - You can't do that! - Nina... - It's okay, it's okay. - Nina... Stop screaming! Stop screaming. You guys are freaking out over nothing. And that... the only thing that's scary is our mind. It's all in our heads, okay? - Exactly. - Listen... You, girl, need to sit down. sit down! - Sit down! Sit down. - Nina, no... Nina... Sit down... And I'm gonna go see what all this mystery is all about, okay guys? Don't worry. Watch me. Watch me! Guys... don't worry. What does she see? Go go! Go go go! I gotta get her! Nina! - Everyone go. - Go! Let's go, let's go! Go! Go! In here, in here. I knew it was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea to come here. I knew it. I would never listen to you if... if it was... Bad idea? Babe, calm down. - Yanna, calm down. - Calm down? Trying, trying to tell me to calm down. You fucking... Why do I ever listen to you? Why was I so stupid to come here with you? I just don't understand. What? Yanna, this is not my fault. - It's not your fault, of course. - What are you sa... Yeah never nothing is your fault, nothing is your fault. You're so blind, Scott. You can't see what's going on. You can't. You know why I came to Youngstown? To break up with you. I can't be your mom anymore. I can't make every single decision. - Yanna! - Of you. Are you fucking kidding me? Fucking kidding you? We almost died in there and you wanna break up with me? Yes, I think it's the perfect time. I need you to wake up, Scott. It's been going on for months. - I can't do it anymore... - Where is this coming from? Seriously! Where is it coming from? Oh God, don't be such a liar. I saw you there with Joanne. I saw it. With Joanne? You're trying to deny it to me? You're un... unbelievable. Joanne's my family friend. She's like my sister to me. All right yeah, I saw what was going on. I knew what was going on. You fucking bastard, I'm done. I'm done, I don't wanna... ever wanna see you again. Seriously, get a fucking grip. This is not the time for this shit. It's not. Yeah, it's true it's not. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. We're gonna be fine, right? We're gonna be fine. Yeah, I hope so. Yeah... Look... Did you hear that? Honestly what's going on right now? I have no clue. I mean is this... What's gonna happen? What's gonna... What's gonna happen to our family? Our friends? Let's hope we get back to them. That's all that matters right now. During my childhood, I was... I was abused by my dad. But I never really told y'all this. Every day... every day coming from school just seeing my dad there... sit on the couch. This mean face with a belt in his hand. Just hit me. Pow pow pow. Crying just on the floors, and every time y'all called me, I just... just act like everything is all right, but nothing was all right. Nothing at all was all right. You guys, I have to tell you... Cause my mom and dad died in that car accident, before you guys met me. So I had to live with my... my grandma. And I just... I don't know what I would do without you guys because... It's okay man. It's okay man. Cause she... You're the only ones that have been there for me. Jed, we love you, all right, man? I love you guys, too. We love you man. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Your mom is out there watching for you, all right bro? She's watching for you, Jed. She's watching for you up in heaven, man. And we gonna stay together. We gonna get through this Jed, all right? Yeah. Just like my dad. He's over us. He's with us. It's fine. Everything will be fine. It's what brought us together, right? Mhmm. It's all that counts, man. It's all that counts. - We'll be fine. - We'll be fine. We gonna take these zombies out. Fuck those zombies. Yeah, fuck the zombies. Let's go... - What the fuck was that? - Oh my God, Ava! - Ava... - Is that... Is that Ava? - Ava! - Sounds just like her. Oh shit. It's coming from here. Oh my god, we gotta... you guys... - Oh my god. What is this? - What is this? - Ava! - Ava! Oh shit! Oh! Oh shit! Yo, what the fuck is going on? What the... They squished her head! Oh shit! - Oh shit! - Oh my god! Oh my god. This can't be happening, man. Yo, this shit can't be happening, man! Woohoohoo! Ken! Help me! Ken! Help me! Ahh! Oh my god. Go go! What is that? Ahh! Oh god. Oh god. Is that a gun? Who is that? Go! Uh, go go go go go! Holy fuck! Go go go go go go go! Get behind us! - Calm down. - Calm down! You're gonna be all right... You'll be all right. You'll be all right. No problem. - Get down. - Get down. - Everybody get down. - Get down. Get down Oh my god, oh my god. - Oh shit. - Oh my god. Don't worry about it. You'll... I promise you. You'll be okay. You'll be okay. You'll be fine. Guys, where's Ken? He's still out there. No, as long as you're with me, you're gonna be fine. Are you a priest? - You're... - Yes, yes I am. - You're a priest. - I'm father Frank. Oh come on... You know what, we've seen too many priests today. Listen, we need all the good will we can get. What did the priests in the basement do but die? And they're dead. They're all dead. Okay, but this is a different situation, right now. We need all the good will we can get, right? We have only each other. And God is with us. No, he's not. Who's the fucking God? Are we safe now? Are we safe... yeah... - We're not safe! - For now! We don't know where we're going. What is this, some sort of conspiracy? No. No conspiracy. I'll put my life on the line for this. Listen this whole fucking thing is crazy. There's fucking zombies running around out there eating people and shit. Our friend Ken is dead, all right? Our friend is dead, all right? We need to get the hell out of this Goddamn town. We're gonna die. If we stay out here, we're gonna die. Just like those girls at the party. Listen! This... ...just like the priests, we're gonna fucking die! This is the time to come together okay, because we're all we have. We have nothing, okay? All we have is our trust in each other, okay? Okay honey, okay. We don't wanna end up like Ken, we don't. - Can we all hold hands? - Do we have any choice? Can we all hold hands please? And say a prayer on our own. - You may not believe... - I'm not doing this. but we have to believe now. You don't have to do it ma'am. Okay? But God will protect us. We need to find a way out of this fucking town. I fucking mean it. We're gonna be out of this... I am not gonna die here. I am not gonna stay here and wait for anybody. - I agree. - Nobody. You understand? Yes I do, ma'am. Just try, Yanna. Just try to pray. I came here for my friend's funeral. I didn't come here to die, all right? And this is how we ended up in the back of a fucking truck. Grant me the serenity... Let's, together. You know this prayer. Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things we can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Our father, who art in heaven... - We have courage - They kingdom come... - thy will be done - ... courage... ...on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. For thy is the kingdom, thy is the wisdom... - I don't believe it in any... - I can't, I can't do this. I just can't. The power, the glory, the kingdom, the power, the glory, yours. Well, I guess you're alive until you die, you know, so... - But... - We're alive. I know and God is to protect us. God is to protect us. God is to protect us. - God is to protect us. - Last thing, last thing is... - Listen to me. - God is to protect us. God is gonna show us the way. God is gonna show us the way. God is gonna show us the way. God is gonna show us the way. God is gonna show us the way. Okay, a moment of silence. Just a few moments of silence. And pray for the sick and suffering. We are not suffering cause we're safe. We're safe. Okay you're gonna be fine, sir. You'll be fine, young man. Could you come up here, please? Marcus. Mar... Marcus, could you just come up here? Could you please come up here? - No no, I'm fine. I'm fine. - Are you sure? I'm fine, I'm just... Leave me alone. I'm fine. Oh shit. Oh shit. Out of the truck! Come now! All of you, hurry. Hurry. Don't look around. You're not a sight-seeing tour! Come! Marcus... are you okay? Move. I don't know where we are. This way. Does this seem like a safe place to you? What are you saying? Stop talking. I don't trust you. I don't trust this place. I need to get out of here. - We don't... - No, she's right guys. We don't know this guy. Stop screaming, guys. Let's have... You gonna stay here? He took us away from the zombies. We need to get out of here, guys. No, Ava... Don't listen at all to the foolishness. - Come on. - Ava, come on! What are you doing? - Just please... - I'm gonna go. - You wanna stay? - No, Yanna! Go! If you're gonna go, go! Yanna, are you serious? Serious, yeah. Where are you gonna run to? Against the wall. This is crazy. I can't believe this. I can't believe this. - I know, we can't stay here. - No, we have to stay here. You guys, save yourselves. Save yourselves. If they're stupid enough to run off... leave them. That's just fucked up, it's just not right, man. Why are you guys still filming all of this? I mean seriously. After everything that you just saw? Who else is gonna tell our story? This isn't a story man, this is survival. We're gonna freaking die. This is government shit, dude. If the world doesn't see this, it's gonna happen everywhere else too. Do you have information about what's going on? It doesn't matter, you really need to turn that off. Those lights... But aren't you afraid too? Yeah. I'm all for it. I... if they don't cover this, and this is a government conspiracy, or whatever the fuck this is, people need to see this. Shit. Um, look what if we don't make it? What if we all, what if we all get killed here? Yo, shut up. Stop saying that. I mean it's possible. This is just not fucking right, you guys. Like honestly, this is just not fucking right. - Oh my God... - You're in a safe place. Come on, let's sit down. Everyone get down, everyone get down. We need to go back and get them. No, we're in a safe place. Could you sit down please? Be calm. Ask these guys what's going on. Whatever. - Oh... - Oh my God, the lights. - The lights! - Oh my God... - What'd I tell you? - He's back. What'd I tell you? Put that down. Put it down. - What are we doing now? - Against the wall. Why or what are we doing here? Against the wall. No, you against the wall, put that there. You against the wall. - All right, relax! - Against the wall. Where are these zombies coming from? Why are they here? The military has had experiments going on on the battlefield for years. Do you think we're just there to help stop terrorism? We're there to cause experiments that will help us profit and dominate. To be an empire, not to spread democracy. We are an empire, and we do that through death, destruction, and money grabbing. We had experiments on our own soldiers. In Afghanistan, my own buddies... guys I was fighting with every day, we bled together, okay? That's where it started, they have a cure, but they will not use it until it gets so big... after Youngstown is gone, and then they'll present it on the market, and make billions. Billions and billions on your corpses. So what do we do? You listen to me, okay? Yes. Everyone? Yes. Yes. If you want to live, you will listen to me. Is this... is this what happened to Bobby? Bobby was on our team. I knew Bobby. I fucking knew it. That's terrible. But what about change? What about whoever we're gonna be voting for against big corporations? Did you go to school? Yeah, I did. I went to a liberal arts college. Did you study history? Yeah. There's your answer. Is this on the news? Where are the press? Are they following this story? Do people know? Is this on the news? You're in Youngstown. Nobody cares. Sit back. I want you to relax, get some rest. We've got a long night ahead of us. Are you the only one? I'm the only one. Why are you saving us? I have my reasons. I don't wanna get too close to you, but I want you to live. Um, I don't know if anybody's ever told you before... but you look like the Terminator. He does look like the Terminator Doesn't he? Oh my God... You bitches are crazy. Why would you say that? This girl's gonna get us shot. - Shit... - No he's not. She's fucking crazy. What are we gonna do about our friends? My girlfriend and Marcus is out there. We have to be concerned about us right now. - Maybe he'll go get them... - That's really selfish, father. - Yeah. - Seriously. Well, let's start, let's start with us, and then we'll go further. You know what, fuck this. He's not gonna help us, I'm going to Yanna. - I'm gonna find Marcus... - Come on, sit down. - Don't go... - No. You know what? He's not gonna help us. Our friend Bobby died like this, okay? You're gonna dig a hole and hide in it? What the fuck, man. Stay. Just... We were told to stay here. You guys can stay here. I'm gonna find them. Do... we, we should go after him. No. We have to stay in this room together. - Joanna... - No, you know we have to. No, we don't. We can stay in this room together. That's what he said, we have to stay together. Yeah, we don't know what's going on out there, guys. - No no no no no. - I'm going. Just stay, just stay. Come on. Just stay, please? - Just stay with me. - Jed. Just stay here. This is crazy. Why aren't you listening to what he said? No, come on. - and we can be safe, okay? - We're going. No. We have to go find Scott. No no. - No. No. - Let her go. Come on. - Don't go, stay with us. - Just stay. We're a team, we're doing this for Ken. Come on, just stay here with us. - No. No. Come on. - You're safe here. We're safe... Come on. That's what they say about fashion... Goddamn... Whoo.. Oh shit. Mm, look at you. And you, and those. And... Ooh, mm. Disgusting... Hello? Hello? Marcus? Is that you? Marcus... Marcus... Marcus. Marcus? Oh, fuck! What the fuck. Come one. Who are you? Sick fucker! There's no one here. Did you hear that? I think it's coming from down here. Mealtime's over, you fucking piece of shit! Where's Yanna? Where's Marcus? Where's that fucking Terminator guy? Don't ever fucking come to my town! Ugh. Fuck! Ahh fuck, get off! Come on man... Holy shit. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go find the Zombinator. Oh god. Oh god. Do you know where the others went? Did you see any of them? Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. I think they were falling behind, all I saw... I only saw, I only saw Yanna and Scott run in and... Wait they were in front of us. They were in front of us, they were in front of us. Well... do you know where they went? Did they come in through the same door as us? No, I have no idea. I don't know where they went. I don't know where they went. We need to find them. We need to find Scott. We need to find everybody. We need to find everybody. I don't know where they went. I mean if we don't know where they are, then that's fine, then we just have to find Scott. We have to find Scott and Yanna, right? I mean I don't know if we're gonna find Yanna, but we definitely have to... we need to find Scott. - ... need to find the others. - No, we need to find him. The others... What's that? Wait the bathroom, the bathroom, the bathroom, the... That's fucking where Scott was, right? Oh my God, we have to go. How are we gonna get through? They're just fucking zombies, right? They're just fucking zombies right? Are you, are you gonna come with us? Fuck, you better come with us. I got 20 pounds of camera gear with me. I don't give a fuck about your 20 fucking pounds of Goddamn camera... Why are you still filming anyway? ...run with us and we're gonna get... Cause I just fucking... We need to find Scott, please... I love him. I, I just said it, okay? I love him. We need to find him. Okay. Let's go. Are you coming? Wait, let's just... let her fucking do it, right? Go! Lock it! It doesn't lock. There's nothing in here. Can we go in there? I'm not going in there, look at that... Come on. Here they come. - Dude there's no... - There's not enough room. Fucking hide, fucking hide. Why are you fucking... Come hide, man? Shh shh. Oh fucking Scott. Do you fucking see Scott? I'm sorry. No, whatever. I hear someone. It's one of them... Fucking ge... Well, hello dears. Oh God. I'm gonna cry. Let me get you into safety. You have to fucking help us, you have to fucking help us. - Cause they're here... - Wait... We got some helpers. No the zombies are out there. No no no. No, no. It's okay. What've we got here? Couple of, couple of... - I'm Joanne. - Little precious... No! What are you fucking doing to her? - No! - Yes! Fucking get fucking away from me. No! No! - No! - No! Don't! Don't! Shut your pie-holes. Wakey wakey. Ugh! You know I'm so disappointed in you. You were damn near my protege. We're in Afghanistan fighting side by side, then we're winging it out there and boom - a corporation comes along and gives us a ticket to ride. Next thing I know, you're on the other side. Now... what is up with you, man? We got the best weapons, we got state of the art equipment, we're doing what we were always given the skill set to do. You know we're in the one percent, and instead you go with the great unwashed 99 percent. We're gonna take these pupa, and we're gonna get them infected with this disease, and then we're gonna cure them all. Now what's the harm in that? You could've been a profit participant. Just like the rest of us. Huh? Instead... we're gonna have to let the zombies take you and... masticate on your, your well-toned body. Colonel, I don't think you can understand anymore. You're a lost man. No no no wait, let me explain to you. We are the healers. We get them sick, but we make them well, and we make a big time buck while we're doing it. Now what is wrong with that? One twisted philosophy. Let me share you with a little something. We're like Dr. Lister coming up with Listerine. - Yeah? - Yeah. Colonel, you were the best. Now, you're not even in the rank. You're nothing, and these men you have with you? Heartless bastards that don't even deserve to hold a weapon. Shut up. You were the best okay? You were trained by this man. So you're a backstabbing bastard, that's what you are. I am the best. You're the best my fucking ass, look where you are now with the chains, huh? How's that make you the best? I won't be in these chains for too long. You'll see me again, you bastards. Guess what? Every zombie in Youngstown is gonna know where you are, and they're gonna come along and the very people that you're saving are gonna be the ones that are gonna chomp all over you. Yeah? So... God bless, brother. I would've loved to have you on the team. You don't know who God is anymore, Colonel. He's the one who's got the biggest dividends. Its the American way. Are you all right? Get me out of here. Come on, hurry. Guys, come on. Get him out of here. I can't do this myself. Who's in the bags? Who's in... What are they... Who's in there? - Are they dead? - Oh. Is she alive? Good god. They've been injected. Goddamn it, Carol. I told you this is my night out. Listen... Why don't you go and... Your helmet might help. Is this how you wanna do it, Colonel? I'll do it anyway you like. You know I hate fights like this. I always get my shirt ripped. I'm so sick. I'm done with... I'm not even getting paid. I came here for the free pizza. I didn't get... I'm done, dude. Dude, I don't care. Ooh, I'm the camera man. No done. Dude, we're gonna fucking win awards for this shit. - I don't care. - You're gay. Gonna get riches... Turn that damn thing out of my face. Dude. You need to be... Bye I quit. Bye Bye. - Dude, I think there's... - Bye! Dude, that's so... There's zombies down there. You wanna see my ass? - Done. - So gay. I'm gonna tattoo D-U... D-O-N-E on my ass. Goodbye. Whatever man, you're dead. Bye. Well, fuck it. There goes our sound guy. Yeah, I guess we're rolling on camera. Sound guy's dead. Sound guy's dead. You're dead dude. There's zombies in there. Bye. Which one are we gonna go in? There's no safe place to... It's just too weird. Zombinator said he'll protect us. Go! Go! Nina! Get the fuck out of my... Lieutenant, you got some hard bark on you coming down here like this. You put a. 45 slug in me. That's enough for books, Colonel. Well I hope to return the favor. Now I aim like I haven't had since I was a little baby. Wonder what hell's gonna look like. You'll know soon enough, Colonel. No! No! No! What's her life worth, brother? What's she worth, Atam? Yeah? Colonel, she's worth a hell of a lot more than you. And apparently a hell of a lot of more than America to you. Bobby bit the big one for the corporation, and these people aren't gonna get the serum if you don't let me out of here. You get a commission on Bobby? Did you get some money? What'd you buy, Colonel? It's all part of a strategic plan. Please help me. Please help me... I told you I'd get you back, brother. Hey little girl... Come on. Kiss me like you love me. Maybe I'll take you with me. It's a new day. Bon appetit, Colonel! No, no!
