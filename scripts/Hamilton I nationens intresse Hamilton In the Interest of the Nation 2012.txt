Except in self-defense or if it is in the Nation's interest. You had a bad dream again. Did I wake you? No. Why can't you tell me where you're going? Because I won't lie to you. Don't then ... tell me the truth. I'm coming back. Four months later. Uzbekistan, on the border of Afghanistan. Denisov, Denisov... I know when someone is bluffing. It's just what you think. I see it in your eyes. As my mom used to say, "If you trust women," "you die poor." "If you trust men," "you die young." Your mother was a wise woman. You bastard ... What a hell of luck you have! Mr. Green has taught me everything I know. Mr. Green, Mr. Dollar. Mr. Green is a good man. We're set. We go tomorrow. That's good ... This fucking place is starting to get on my nerves. Cheers! Krutov, take out the goods. Follow me. How many do you have? As agreed. 200 pieces. If you have the correct coordinates, you can hit an American in the head 80-kilometers away. Take them away. Come on. Help. - Denisov, is that your real name? - Yes. Yeah? You know what this is? Face against the truck! Bandits! Chaka. There is one guy who's missing, the driver Sergei. So where is my money? The driver's missing. Find him! After him! Military Intelligence and Security...Stockholm. So an unknown group, turns out to be Europe's most wanted weapons smuggling organization. And 200 Sky Shadow mortars go missing. Is that what I'm supposed to think? That's what happened. Your mission was... to watch over the Swedish-made GPS guided shells, so they would not fall into the wrong hands. And yet they have disappeared and you don't know where. That's not really what happened is it? Hamilton's mission was to map the networks dealing with weapons. Tthat was the mission you gave him, but for the last 3 months I have been the operational commander. And still I have not been informed of these networks. Dimitri and the one who was to buy them were killed in the attack. Then, perhaps your mapping was not so good. Gentlemen. He's new ... and has to show off. Between us ... What is your take on this group? Well-organized. Professionals. The man I had taken out had a watch on... a Luminox. They seemed to be U.S. Special soldiers, most likely Navy Seals. - Americans! - Maybe. Awubere, Ethiopia. See, it comes up like that. Press F... Send, OK? Right now I'm going to get the coordinates from my buddy, ok? You hang on to that. You got the coordinates? - Are these the correct GPS coordinates? - Uh huh. - It's densely populated. - We're set to go. That's his home. The hit was supposed to happen with Sidalman. Change in plans. Come on man... Samata Rahim has two children ... No way ... I do not murder children ... - They'll take all the blame. You're not doing anything. - I just instructed him how to use the coordinates.And? ... Lee, This is no time to question orders. Abdullah whatever your fuckin' name is. Here are the coordinates. Wait here. - Hey! - Hey Benjamin, - Everything ok? - Yeah. Oh, it shall be so nice to get home. I have to fix some presents to the kids. - Remind me to pick up something at the airport. - No problem. Jesus ... Get out of the car! - You're not gonna warn him. - Get out of the goddam car! Now what? You going to hide? We'll find you! You know you can't disappear. Now give me the gun. - Back off! - Jesus! Or the next shot goes right between the eyes. - Lagerback, get over here. Come on, now! - Ok. - Drive! I said drive! I'm sorry. But it was not my intention to drag you into this. Drag me into what? We worked together for a month, all of a sudden you pull a gun like a maniac. What's going on? Lagerback ... You've been technical advisor for Sectragon, who in turn have been training terrorists. What are you talking about? Sectragon will come after me with everything they got. So that's what you need me for, I'm, I'm your hostage? No! But for your own safety, I can't tell you any more. Now I'm going to Djibouti. From there you can get a safe way back home to Sweden. We can work something out. You can take my money ... You can have the money! What did he say? What's happening? Sweden ... I am a Swedish citizen You are on the wrong side of the border, this is Somalia! Soder Hospital. Stockholm. I hope you won't have to come in tonight. Bye, see you! Is it him? - Mmm. - Good luck. What do you want? To see you. After four months? Forget it. You're right. I haven't told you who I am. What I'm doing. Why I disappear. But I never told you lies. No, but ... for four months. I'll try to explain, if you're willing to listen. You have lived as Russian with weapons smugglers? You're a spy. I'm an intelligence officer. Yes I thought you were cheating on your wife or something like that. I've thought about you every day since I left. I understand if you can't handle it anymore. If you don't want to see me. But I wanted to see you. When I was over there, this time, it ... it made me think. About what? That I want to change my life. What would you change it to? I want to live my life with you. That's what I want to do. I've done the other. Let's go home. We have a problem in Somalia. We are waiting for the go-ahead from the government, about how it should be handled. I will arrange it so that you get all the info. It might be a link to Afghanistan. Get ready to go again. Are you having me followed? No. - It's not someone I recognize. - I'll check it out. And I'll check out Mary as well. She was the last one you were with before you left Sweden. How the hell do you know about that? - Do you think that she's involved? - What do you think? I think you're wrong. I'm coming. Be careful. Bye. I'm on call. I have an emergency surgery, so I have to go into ... Ok. You stay here! I'm going to make breakfast later. Prime Minister's Office. Stockholm. So we don't know where Lagerback is? Or whether he's alive? Have you gotten any new information? Yes. Lagerback is in Somalia. Imprisoned. - Imprisoned? Yes. Yep. Clas Olofsson. What was Lagerback doing in Ethiopia? Lagerback was there on a personal trip. He disappeared on the border with Somalia. Isn't that an extremely dangerous region to choose as a private destination? We have no further details about his captivity at the moment. Do you think that his work with you on advanced high-tech weapons may have something - to do with his disappearance? - No. I don't think so. But that's a suspicion that's just hard to ignore. You as deputy director at the North Fors, should really know what he was doing there. Martin Lagerback worked with education. All of us at the North Fors Industries hope that the government do their utmost so that he may soon be reunited with his family. Do you think, Prime Minister, that this can get in the way of the coming peace conference? This, among other things, Ethiopia's prime minister, Josef Bekele - will be there? - Fire! The conference is an opportunity for Josef Bekele and the other parties to create stability in the region. Will you, as Minister, now take a closer look at your appointments since North Fors Industries is involved, in order to see if there are links - to the countries in the region? - Hmm, uh, no. Since Lagerback's disappearance has nothing to do with business. - So ... - That's not what I asked. Will the government not investigate North Fors' denial that Lagerback was there in Ethiopia on business at their expense? The idea that Sweden would be involved in the handling of weapons in the region is ridiculous. Sweden has never and will never approve weapons to warring countries. So you think we should employ a security company? A private army to rescue Lagerback? Mmm. Well no, not us, but North Fors Industries. Clas Olofsson contacted me and suggested this idea. How would it really take place? Sara ... let Sectragon take care of this. They are pros. Two years ago, Sectragon saved six Dutch aid workers in Colombia, and last year there were two French doctors in Mogadishu. I want a Swedish person. Someone with experience in situations like this. Yes. The killer has taken some photographs. Probably someone from Poland who contacted her. I believe that the killer is trying to lead us astray. Maria had awakened. She was called to come in, at 23:45. Why would she make her bed before she left? Yes, perhaps she had not gone. What? - No no. The doctor on duty sleeps when she can. How did she afford this apartment? The doctor on duty, You know ... "Go to work, get a life." Your plane leaves in about two hours. Read, then we'll go over the details. What do the police think? You made it look like the killer has links to Poland. The apartment is clean, the murder weapon is gone there is no incriminating evidence. Mary was innocent. You can't do this, unless you can get past this. Samata Rahim. Somalian exiled politician. He was killed in a bomb attack yesterday. No one has accepted the blame. Take a look. Martin Lagerback. Employed by North Fors Industries. He specializes in GPS and laser-guided weapons. He was taken by Somali militia. North Fors has appointed Sectragon to free him. I am convinced that these Sky Shadow weapons that disappeared in Afghanistan are now located in Somalia. You should be with Lagerback when he's released, and make sure he comes home to Sweden. You fly to Djibouti. I need a few hours in Beirut. If I do this, then I do it my way. Get home Lagerback, no detours. It was Mansfield's security requirements. Keep him away from me. He's not going to be happy with that, landing in Beirut. Beirut. Lebanon. - Mona, looking great! - You look tired. I need a back door. I have a contact in Somalia. His name is Chad. - Tareq you're still hanging around. - Mr. Hamilton. Carl ... Is this about the terror attack in Ethiopia, using Swedish weapons? We might be small, but we are not blind. Terrorists with high-tech weapons is not a good sign. Terrorists? Well, everything about this points to Al-Shabab in Somalia. Apparently you know more than I do. That's not good. Don't worry. You're here as an observer and asking me for a back door. Is there anything else I shouldn't worry about? I'll get in contact if necessary. I have a plane to catch. Somalia. - Hamilton? - Rob Hart? Okay, three things. Firstly, you're under my command. Secondly, you're here just as an observer. And thirdly ... hey! Thirdly, we will do our job ... whatever happens. And that is? - Complete the mission - You understand? - Absolutely. Miller, make sure he's dressed for the occasion. Follow me. In case things get serious. Make sure he stays up front boss. - What do you have? - The usual. Nothing unusual? No! Go ahead. - Go. - Close the door. With me. Keys. Ok, keep focused! Let's go! Hurry up! Come on! Move! Put it down! Come on, come on! Go! Drop the gun! Where is he? It's him. Who are you? Where's the American? Hey. Hey, we're done here! You say nothing! You understand? Ok. - Drop the gun. - Gun Down! Put down your weapon. What? You thought we wouldn't find you? Let me make something perfectly clear. You're a fucking traitor! What are you going to do to me now? Who are you? - Drink! - You're Swedish ... Drink! You're dehydrated. There's going to be many questions asked when you return to Sweden. You have not been in Ethiopia to work, do you understand what I'm saying? - I know, I know ... - Listen! It looks like you're involved with stolen weapons for North Fors. - I didn't know. I just trained them. - Who's "them?" Sectragon. Two days ago Sky Shadow shell struck a target in Ethiopia, it was fired from Somalia. Oh fuck ... Then it's true, what he said. Who? Benjamin Lee. The man who sat in the cell next to you? Yes. He worked for Sectragon, He ran off to tell the authorities that they have trained terrorists in Somalia. Ok. What's going to happen now? We're going home. Where are we taking them? You go with Miller, Miller take him to the hotel. Come on we're moving out! What about Lagerback? You've done your bit. Lagerback will be home in a few days. - Ok. - Hey! You forgetting something? Sectragon Headquarters. Dallas. Yes. Hello? Smith? It's Hart here sir ... Hold on sir ... Sir! The prison extraction is complete. The Swede and Lee are out. - Has anyone else talked to him? - No sir! The helo's coming in now. Yes sir! - Well, do you know what to do? - Yes sir! Take care of it. Take care of him. Ok. Sectragon Headquarters, Dallas. We require freedom of movement. There is an individual we need to retrieve. Without creating any problems. Can that be arranged? What did you have in mind? I would like to see his name on the list. What did you do for Sectragon? Trust me. Or I leave you out here, your choice. My field was information. Intelligence service. Black operations. Who the hell are you? I'm a Commander in the Swedish Intelligence Service. What do you know about the missing shells in Afghanistan? Take me to Sweden with you, and I'll tell you all I know. One was used to take out an exiled Somalian politician in Ethiopia. Samata Rahim. I tried to stop that. That's why I'm here. Why is Sectragon supplying terrorists in Somalia? They are prepared to go all the way. By any means necessary if they have to. I'm not saying another word. Either you take me to Sweden with you ... Or you leave me here. Your choice. We'll protect you. You stay put. Mr. Hamilton? I'm Chad. Mona sends her regards. So walk with me. Lee, this is Chad. You go with him. We'll meet later in Amman. Stockholm. The Government has been able to get kidnapped Martin Lagerback home. He was been imprisoned in Somalia. And the militant Islamist group Al-Shabab took credit today for the murder of the exiled Somali politician Samata Rahim and his family. The Ethiopian intelligence service thinks the strike took place with a Swedish GPS guided shell known as a Sky Shadow. U.S. military leaders think the development in the area is disturbing. Both Al Qaeda and Al-Shabab have strong roots in Somalia. And they now have high-tech weapons and knowledge of how to use them. This implies a changing power shift, according to the African Foreign Ministry expert, Jan Erik Ramfors. I want you to get to the bottom of this. I want you to investigate all business that North Fors Industries has been involved in in recent years. I want to know exactly how this happened. Do you think Clas Olofsson knows something we don't? He was very relaxed about getting home Lagerback. If it turns out that there have been any illegalities I don't want to find out about it on TV. Yes. Hello? Hello? Hi Hey, I'm Anna Rune from the police. I wonder if you ... recognize this woman? Yes, she was here, with some man... They sat there. Okay, this man had ... Amman, Jordan. - Aren't we supposed to meet tomorrow? - Yes. But Tareq has some questions. - Tareq? - Who is Benjamin Lee? He worked for Sectragon. He has information regarding Swedish security. He works for them? So how come he's listed as a terrorist in the U.S.? Anyone that helps Benjamin Lee will be tagged as a terrorist. Sectragon has contacts, that's why he's on that list. The purpose of that list is to scare people like you. Do you remember Chad? Yea. The guy who helped you in Somalia. He's missing. If Chad talks, Mr. Hamilton, it's not going to be about you. The PLO must be out of this. We will trade Lee for Chad. Tareq, please. Can I have a moment alone with Mona? Don't discuss it any further. This is none of our business. Ok, Tareq. I will handle this. I hope we finish this soon, Mr. Hamilton. - Bye. - Bye. Are you aware that you have provoked the largest private army in the world? Well, it crossed my mind. I could not find any information to link him to Sectragon, so Tareq is right. This is none of our business and the PLO must not be associated with terrorists. He is not a terrorist. Do you think I'd be here if I didn't believe in him? They're not going to leave you, you know? They're going to come after you when this is over. You know I've been in this business for over 20 years now, Statistically, my time is up. I need your contacts to get Lee out of the country. I need you to trust me. I do. Somalia. Gonzalez ... Up! You've got a sister, talk or she'll be here next. In Amman ... With who? With who? Think about your sister ... Here with me. Who's your contact in Amman? Mona ... Mona Al-Fatha. And a man. Amman, Jordan. Salam Aleikum. Where is Lee. You take me to him. - Another time. - You failed before. The border between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. It was you. When I'm finished with Lee, I'm coming for you. As God wants. Hello. You got him? I can take out Hamilton, repeat, I can take out Hamilton. No, he'll lead us to Lee. We'll take him out later. Hello. Call me Tareq. Sniper to the right on the roof. Go! Tareq hurry to the car! Quick! The car Tareq! Tareq! What about Lee? Did you get him? Did you get him? Tareq. I'm sorry. If people are going to sacrifice their lives for you... I want to know why. Why is my friend dead? I said, answer me! What do you know? Don't do it. Don't do it. I hope he's worth it. Wait here. Sit. May God have mercy on his soul. Keep an eye on them. I'll be right back. I really appreciate all the help you've given me. I used my friendship with Mona to save your life. So now, I want you tell me everything you know. War is extremely profitable for an organization like Sectragon. Pentagon has fed over $10 billion to private contractors in Iraq. The world is waiting for Al-Shabab to strike again. And I know when and where that'll happen. Hart's team will carry out the operation. But Al-Shabab will get the blame. What will they do? I'll give you more information when I'm in safety. You are on the CIA's terrorist list. Sectragon has contacts in the CIA. What can I do? Demand to speak to our extra trial Prime Minister. That's your only chance to get through to the right people. Ok. The airport is under surveillance. So we take you to Damascus. You fly from there. Abu Omar, give me something to cover him. Stockholm's archipelago. Mr. Lee ... Welcome. Your business is finished now, Hamilton. This way please. I've already told you sir, Only if I can speak directly with the prime minister will I speak about any information concerning Sectragon. I don't think your negotiation tactics serves you well, beacause it's only a matter of time before the CIA finds out that you in Swedish custody. You remember that! There was one thing, she called me later in the night. She had forgotten her computer and wanted me to look after it. - Do you have it here? - Yes, come here. Ehm, this is the man who was there with Mary. We have two witnesses who can verify it. I want to know if I can publish this picture in the press? - Wait for a bit. - Why? Ehh ... There's something I have to check. Check what? Was I unclear? Was there anything I said you don't understand? - You know who it is don't you? - Back off for now, back off. North Fors Industries, Stockholm. The Foreign Ministry has not approved any end-user certificates that have not been correct. There are no "hidden appointments" no bribes ... No smuggling that can be connected to North Fors. There's just one small detail that will show up during an investigation. What? That it was you who pushed through the Sky Shadow agreement with Hungary a year ago. Yes, but it was completely by the book. - Yes. - Yes. And now they are gone. And you have not been paid. And now they are being used by Al-Shabab in Somalia. But, but wait a minute, what the hell are you saying now? What? Clas, what the hell? Swedish intelligence has a man in their custody. He knows all about this. - Yes, and, and who is it? - His name is Benjamin Lee. And he's going to tell everything he knows. So Benjamin Lee will need guarantees from the Swedish government. - He wants a new identity and protection. - Mmmm. And he will only talk directly with you, personally. Well that's not a problem. Well unfortunately, the U.S. has listed him as a terrorist. Benjamin Lee knows, how step by step they are setting the stage for a war in Horn of Africa. But these claims come from a terrorist. Is there any evidence? No! - Benjamin Lee is credible. - So, he's credible? Are we suppossed to ignore information that comes from the CIA? Sectragon is planning an assassination where the blame is placed on terrorists. When it happens, a war in the region is inevitable. Get him to talk. On Tuesday, Joseph Bekele will be at the peace conference. I want to know everything that Benjamin Lee knows. According to sources in American military leadership there is a planned a series of military exercises in Somalia. Ethiopia's prime minister, Josef Bekele who has worked for a peaceful development between countries in the Horn of Africa, is worried about the future of the region, and fears new violence between countries. And we continue now with new information about the murder of Dr. Maria Solska. According to a police spokesman, certain evidence has been found that shows there's a link to Poland where Maria Solska had visited 11 times in recent years. Carl! I want you to talk to Lee. My new boss says I'm finished with it. You're the only one who can get him to talk. You are the only one Benjamin trusts. There was another person who trusted me, but she's dead now. Let Maria Solska go. It was an accident. That was no fucking accident, it was a reflex. You know that as well. I've been training to master it for 20 years. It has saved my life many times. It only took a split second ... I killed Mary. You're wrong. Tomorrow ... I'm turning myself in. You stand outside the system, and there's a good reason for it. You should protect the nation's interests, when necessary. I am trained to kill in the nation's interest. But I can't. I can't anymore. I loved her. Do you understand? Mary's death was perhaps ... a reflex as you say. But the same reflex saved Benjamin Lee's life. So I ask you talk to Lee. Do it before going to the police. You're too late. I already told them everything about the attack. Who have you told? Who? Benjamin Lee is gone. Here's what we'll do, I will meet you and Vernman We have a leak ... Otherwise Sectragon would never have found him. We must get him back. No. I'll handle this. I do this my way now. Carl, you work for me. You'll hear from me. You can't do this alone. I'm not alone. Can you explain to me how the hell Sectragon could find him here? How do you know it was them? Who else could it be? The monitoring files are gone. Damn. Thanks. Thomas, can I have a word with you? Benjamin Lee is gone. He may be dead. Three Swedish soldiers responsible for his safety were killed. Someone leaked where he was. Well. No, but what ... It was only you and I who knew where he was. But my god Sara, are you accusing me? Benjamin Lee is a wanted terrorist, that's all we know. How do we know for sure that someone from our own Intelligence Service didn't do it? Or, or if it was Benjamin Lee who killed our men and then ran ... We don't know this. No. But I'll figure it out now. Thank you for helping me. I'm doing this for Tareq. - So, this is where you hide out? - Yea. See that? There. That's Hart. Yea, but how did he find Lee? Is there a leak? Yea, apparently. But I never heard a word about an attack. - Yea, but he's lying. - He had to survive. And as soon as Hart realizes this, he will kill him. So we go for Hart. He will lead the way to Lee. Did you know her? Yea ... she was murdered. Who did it? So what happened? Maria Solska? Is she involved with this? Did she work for Sectragon? No. Was it your fault? I slit her throat. Can I trust you? What? If we meet Hart and it comes to combat ... Can I trust you? "I've been doing this for almost 20 years now." "Statistically, my time is up," You said that to me back in Amman, didn't you? Yes, I did. So, is that what you prefer? A bullet from Hart? But this doesn't work for me, Carl. You know ... I started to imagine a life with her ... A life? You mean like just an ordinary life? - Like, a life. - Carl! You are who you are, why can't you just accept it? She was innocent. Well she was not the only one. And right now Carl, the only thing I want to know is I can trust you or not. - Do you understand? Yes You can trust me. I'm at home, we need to know what you know. So call me. Hello! I am looking for Carl Hamilton. What is it? That's a very vague answer to my question Johanna ... Yes, come in.. - Is Carl at home? - No. You can speak with me, I'm his father. What has the boy done now? You are not his dad. How did you track him? Through you. I talked with your boss, and then came to visit him when we met yesterday. The reason for the meeting was initiated by you. I saw you. I was just waiting for you to show up. Carl has killed a woman, do you think it's right to protect him? If this did happen, Hamilton is one of our most valuable assets. So now I ask you, and I ask only once forget about this little crusade ... So you think I should just drop it? One time I said, not two! Shall we go? Sectragon Headquarters, Dallas. Lee has been talking. And the damage? - Relatively small. - Do what you have to. And if it involves the Swedish Prime Minister? Josef Bekele will die ... Just not how we planned it. But his death will have exactly the same impact. You see, flexibility is the cornerstone of our profession. If we remain flexible, we maintain control. - Control? - Al-Shabab will take the blame. And the new Ethiopian government will join us in the war against terror. Stockholm. - Hi! - Good morning. - I called earlier and made a reservation. - Yes. Is this a room with a view of the bridge? Absolutely sir, we arranged that for you. It's room 5083. Welcome Mr. Lee. Let's check the timings. All set and clear. Blue Lexus. Boom. We're good to go. - Saliva and DNA on this? - Yea. Good. Hey! It's too big, it'll take out half the hotel. No, there's a construction flaw in the belt. Parts of his head and torso will remain intact. The belt sir. Hart. Hart, wuts you doing? - Hart, please, listen to me. - We are at war. You remember that? Please ... - Josef Bekele will die, for the greater good. For the world to see what happens when terrorism takes a foothold. You brought this on yourself. You'll take out two heads of state, before you blow up yourself up. You didn't see that coming, did you? When you turned yourself against us. Who the hell are you? Wait ... Have you ever used weapons? Have you killed anyone? Sixteen people died on the border between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. A family was wiped out by a Sky Shadow mortar in Somalia. You murdered them. You didn't press the button but you murdered them. Benjamin Lee explained everything to me before Hart kidnapped him. If you do not turn yourself in... And tell everything I'll come back. I promise! Do you understand what I'm saying? - Hart! We have to meet. - What happened? A man came into my office and threatened to kill me. - He knew everything. - Listen, you keep your shit together, you hear me? - Meet me at the lay by in the woods. - Ok. They took the bait. Thank you Mr. Bekele for coming to Sweden. It is my pleasure. I'm sorry. - What did he know? - He knew about you kidnapping Lee. - When did it happen? - About 30 minutes ago ... - Miller. - Yes sir. - Are we alone? - No, Hamilton is following. The package is on time for delivery. Get back to the hotel Clarion now! Sure. He's a dead man. Out! Problem solved ... Let's go! Go! I go for sniper you take the other one. Son of a bitch! Ten minutes. Get up! Get up! Drop it, or I'll cut her throat. - Shoot him ... - Shut the fuck up! - Shoot him! - Drop it, or she's dead. It's good, I'm ok. It went right through, right through. You will be fine. We gotta go! Gotta go! We know that Swedish weapons were used. North Fors Industries are involved ... and Sectragon carried the operation out. Sectragon? Carl, you know where he is and he thinks you're dead. You must see a doctor. You know what to do. Miller, come in. Miller! Miller, come in. Wait ... Carl, please come back. - Heard anything? No Shit. How long? Four minutes. This number will blow the bridge then you've got one hour to get to the assembly point. - Let's do this!Yes sir. - Good luck! Let's Rock! I blow up Lee ... we both die. Is that what you want? Mona Al-Fatha, she was in a car outside. We have her. I make a call ... you have her, I walk ... Problem solved. I mean what I say. Now I need my telephone ... Do it. Make the call. Careful ... Room 5083. Everything is there. - What are you doing here? - I wanted to talk to you. I'll talk with you when you are sentenced ... It's not going to happen. Maria died ... because I am who I am. I'm not going to be judged. But I will live with this ... the rest of my life. It is in the national interest that it is a well-kept secret. Yes. It is fact in the nation's interest. I'm here to ask you to let it go. Wait ... here. It's yours.
