Only few oppose his reign report all suspicious activities Is this yours? Good evening, ID, please. Good evening, sir. ID, please. I don't know... What's your name? My name? I don't know. - Come with us. Number 14 here, we need assistance... Stop! There he is. Stop! Come on. Are you OK? Who are you? What the fuck is going on? Come along. You can't remember anything. I'm experiencing the same thing. Come on. Come on! What are you doing? I... - Hey, are you OK? The investigation is still ongoing, but police sources state... ...that the suspect is probably hiding near the house. The director of Counter terrorism the Netherlands, Willem de Geer, is dead. He was probably killed around 4 am at his home in The Hague. His death has not been confirmed by the police yet. But everyone is certain it concerns Willem de Geer. Prime Minister Sassen released a statement... Finally awake? Yes. He was probably killed around 4 am at his home in The Hague. What's going on? What no one thought possible has happened: Willem de Geer, director of Counter terrorism... ...killed in his own home. - Do you know him'? I don't know. - The investigation is ongoing. But sources state that camera footage of the suspect has turned up. We should really go and eat something. The footage is expected to be released today. So you're back. Is that mine? Yes. How did you get it? Do you know him? I have to get back to work. "Your name is Sam. If you are reading this, you've lost your memory." "But trust what's in this notebook." "This is who you really are." "Your life used to be normal." "Up to a point." I got him on the condition that I'd install the app. My mom drives me nuts. Look. I have to check in every 30 minutes to show where I am. That woman is insane. Do you have a second phone? Because you can route it and give it the ID of your new phone. It's easy. Then you leave it at home and your mom will think you're there. Weirdo. Nice. Sam! The newly released footage shows the suspect of the murder... ...of Counter terrorism director Willem de Geer. The raised fist indicates he's probably a member... ...of the left-wing radical group The Crowd. That's him! That's that boy! The Crowd claims not to be responsible. Stop! Stop! Hello? Having fun? How good are you, really? Not very good. Feel like having a drink with me later? Frank... This is Sam. - Hi, Sam. I'm Frank. Good to see you. We were wondering if you'd be able to help us out. Nick, move over. Ministry of Security Well, sorry. I'm not sure I can... - Come on. They're Nazis. They read our emails, scan our phones. Come on, Sam. Please. OK. Fuck. You're in. Oh, shit. Everything OK? Head office Counter terrorism the Netherlands Six witnesses. All saying it was your idea. Sam... May I call you Sam? You're a talented guy. But it's a shame you apparently want to use your talent against us. How do you think we're doing? Sorry? - As a government. Do you think we're too strict? We have to protect the ordinary citizen. Even if it's at the expense of some liberty. But I'm not one of them. Do you understand? I... Well, I'm not pan of it. - They'll demand a long prison term. But I'd prefer that this doesn't become public. If they find out a student can hack into our system... Well... That's why we'd like to offer you an alternative. A second chance. Welcome everybody. My name is Vermunt. It's an honor to welcome you to this institute. I know that most of you have gone through a difficult period. A period when your behavior was criticized. They said you were lazy, spoiled, selfish... ...and maladjusted. That one is taken. I have good news. That pan of your life is over. Here you'll get a fresh start We offer you an environment in which you are central. We won't look at what you can't do, but instead focus on what you can do. We want you to discover your own specific talent. And that you'll be encouraged to develop that gift to the utmost. To become the master of your own strength. A Master. This group preceded you. No one is excluded because they're different. We don't even use names here. We simply use numbers. And equality is the rule here. Differences don't matter. Everyone is on the same team here. OK guys, you get up at 6.30 am tomorrow. What if I need to take a leak? You can go over there. Oh... No connections are available I'm Louis, by the way. - Number 11, you mean. I'm Sam. Sam? Sam. Do you think you are safe here? - We already know each other. Really? Do you know who I am? Do you know what happened? Good afternoon. How's it going? The food... They have everything. Hello? No? We should do this again. Geez. Party people, those Masters. Seven? Yeah. You wanted to break the defense code with your own written software? Nice job. I'm your coach. Coming? Try to hack it. What? You hack into my system with your laptop. What do you see? You're the administrator and, apparently, you monitor the secured data. You're a hacker up to no good. What would you do? Well, copy your data. OK, delete your data. - Go ahead. Do it. What did it say? Whether I was sure I wanted to delete all of your data. All of my data? Oh, fuck. I'm deleting my own hard drive. Listen. Lesson one: Hacking into someone's computer is quite simple for an amateur. A good hacker turns someone into his or her own enemy. If you can turn the expertise of the targets against themselves... ...then you're a master. What's your name? Number 7. Sam. -Sam... My name is Marit. Are you ready for your first lesson? In addition to your individual coaching we also do physical training every day. Stamina, strength, agility... ...and self-defense. "Self-stimulation. Self-confidence starts with yourself... Though sometimes you have to convince others. Make an attempt. Come on, hit me. Hit me! You think that's funny? What do you guys do during your own individual practice? I have a chemistry lab all to myself. It's awesome. It has everything: Raw materials, Bunsen burners, beakers, everything. Move it. Number Two. Tilt backwards, feet against the wall. Come on. Try to put your feet against the wall. Turn around. Number Eight. Number Seven. Hey, well done, buddy. Don't think you can beat me, dude. Hey, Sam. Did you make a lot of new friends yet? - I think so, yes. See? I told you you'd be fine. Mom... something weird is going on here. Fine, I'll figure it out myself. I don't know. We were in the pool yesterday and there was a guy... Hey... Are you OK? I'm telling you, I mentioned that guy in the pool to my mom... ...and the next moment all the computers shut down. I swear... This institute... Congratulations. Due to his excellent achievements... Two has become the first in your group to become a Master. Coming? Work hard, everyone, Seriously? Even you are better. Shit, man. - Want to become a Master that badly? I don't know about you, but wherever I went it was pretty fucking much the same. Criminal stamped on my forehead. Here, we get a real chance, OK? What did they get you for? Fighting? And what's your coach teaching you? It's mostly self-defense... - Louis... First they get us for something, then they teach us to get better at it. That's weird. - Why don't you just go home. This is a prison. - Listen, buddy... ...I know what prisons look like and I can tell you that this isn't one. Shit. What are you doing here? Same as you. Now what? Come on. Shouldn't you get some sleep? The Masters... They're leaving. You see? That doesn't happen in prison. Slowpoke. Let's try it again... Escaping together, but properly this time. How about you learn to fight first? Well, well. The first Master. Right? Where were you these past few days, huh? I saw you were allowed off the compound. What were you doing? Nothing. I have no time for you guys. What the fuck... Huh? How did you do that? - DNS spoofing. DNS spoofing? That's impossible. Those addresses are encrypted. Encrypted data Sam... Don't. Don't. I mean it. What are you doing here, actually? We all have to contribute to society. - Seriously? You don't buy that yourself, do you? - I only know what I can teach you. This is a prison. And it's all wrong. You know that too. - I know nothing. So it seems. DNS spoofing, right? That won't work anymore. It's not clear yet what caused the explosion in the government building. But it was definitely a targeted attack. The damage, caused by the explosion, has increased to a few million. The police expects that the perpetrator is to be found in the left-wing radical groups. The resistance groups seem to look... ...for more violent forms of protest, nowadays, to clarify their ideas. Prime Minister Sassen has stated not to be deterred by these terrorists. This country is still governed by ourselves. Our values, not those of a handful of terrorists. This is the time for all Dutch people to rally around their leader. Only that will stop the terror. Alright, listen... The government building was... I know of a way to get around the electronic lock. But then I will need that glass. So if you can cause some kind of a diversion... No problem. So, ladies and gentlemen, are you enjoying yourselves? Eight. Shut up and get down. - I can't hear you. I can't hear you. - Shut up. Keep your hands off me. - Calm down. Whatever you're planning to do... I'm in. - And? - Easy-peasy. Where did you get that all that shit? - Two's lab. And you know how it all works? How do you know? - Internet. Of course. Done. All right. What the fuck! Tonight. OK? - Tonight. Hey. Jesus. Tonight we're out of here. Nice. - You want to leave too, don't you? What are you listening to? Just something from the old days. Can I listen? What kind of music is this? - I said from the old days. Sorry. Let me listen. My mother used to sing this for me. You don't need to comfort me, OK? Well... I do, don't I? One moment you smash everything to pieces... ...and the next you're weeping like a little girl. Anyway, look at me: I talk and I talk and I talk. I open my mouth and all that comes out is bullshit. I think the music is beautiful. I'm just teasing you... "because I think, or actually feel that you're very... ...very special. Honestly. Never mind. - Weirdo. I know. Don't get any ideas. We kissed. What? - Yeah. It was... OK. OK? Show me. - No. It's just getting exciting. Hand it over. No. Hand it over. - No. I said: Hand it over. Your name is Lara. Lara? Yeah, I think it's a weird name too. Don't get any ideas. Lara. Fuck... Come on. Where are you going? Where are we? No idea. I thought we were going to escape. - Not without Lara. Sam? Fuck! What the fuck is going on here? Surgery successful. Side effects: slight. Headache. No hemorrhages. Four: Implanted. Internal hemorrhages. Vaccinations. Heavy hemorrhages. Third procedure. Deceased. Chip rejected. What is all this? - Lara. Number 8. Chip 8 definite. We have to leave. Lara! - Sam... Come on. Let's go. Now. Holy shit. It's Sassen. There are... - There are results, I know. But this project has two sides: Chaos and the resulting control. What did you think of the explosion? - Spectacular and effective. But we said: No victims. Well... Well... That guy was the father of two children. His throat was slit. I want everything executed with complete perfection. That's what I mean by control. Is that clear? - Mr. Sassen, may I show you something? The Masters blew up the government building. That's where they were going. Why would Sassen blow up his own building? What does Sassen want? Security, control. Stricter laws to monitor us. But those laws won't be implemented without the population's support. May I present to you... This is our latest acquisition. I'd say, go ahead. Do you smoke? - No. From now on you do. Stub it out. On your arm. Again. That's enough. The demonstration is over. Says who? - It's clear. Is there a problem, Willem? You disagree with me again? I'll wait outside. Everything under control? - Of course. Don't worry. De Geer won't stand in our way anymore soon. Is their memory loss permanent? Even if someone would remember something, it will be vague and incoherent. In fact, you'll just have a confused teen, once a criminal... ...who'll claim he had to commit an assault in your name. No one will believe it. This is the sewer that controls all the chips. What are you doing? - I'll try to turn off her chip. What? - Marit. We have to get out of here. Now. Now. Let's go. Sam, come on. Sam, now what? - Back to our room. Listen, that chick of yours is gone, destroyed. So will we if we don't leave now. - Do what you want. I'm staying. Lara... What are you doing? You've got a chip in your head. Feel it. Feel it yourself. Here. Listen, I wrote everything down. Who I am. What happened that night. Everything. Keep it safe. If I turn out to be a zombie after all, give it back to me. OK? After all? - I exchanged the chip meant for me... ...for an empty one, but I have no idea what it will do. Just for yourself? Leave. Seven... Do you know why we lock all the doors at night? To prevent characters like you from snooping around. I like you Seven. I think you'll do great here. Have you spoofed a DNS lately? Your nose... Sam? Sam? OK... Finish this. I'll be right back. Sam? You're right. I'm a coward. And I'm sorry. Hey, man. Do you know who I am? Number 11. You're number 11. Athletic, a good boxer. You snore at night and talk a bit too much. And you run like a girl. Fucker. Do you hear me? I have evidence. When we're allowed off the compound, I can escape and spread this footage. Yes, when you are allowed off the compound. - What do you mean? I have to stay here, don't I? Louis... I'll come back. - Whatever. Yesterday afternoon... ...a flash drive disappeared according to our inventory. From your room. Seven had a lesson there. Seven... Could you stub this out? On your arm. Did you leave him alone at your terminal? No. Really? You're a hundred percent sure Seven couldn't have done this? I'm a hundred percent sure, yes. Good. Because we still need you. You, on the other hand... As you know, Marit hasn't been herself lately. She was depressed. She left the institute last night. You never saw her again. Get ready for the mission. What happens next? Nothing. It stops here. - And now? How do you know this will work? I don't. Stop it. Sam. Sam, I'm a coward. You know what to do. Seven, you switch off all the security cameras. Communication only through the ear buds. Two . Very good. Get to work. I'm in. The camera's are switched off. Doors open? GO, go, go' Two, Eight, eliminate the target. Switch that camera back on. Now. Now walk towards it and raise your fist in front of the camera. Seven, what are you doing? Join the others. Seven... Join Eight and Two. Number Eight ready to go. Come on, move it. Two and Seven, search the first floor. Eight, to the basement. We have to get out of here. Lara... Get out of here. They want to kill you. - Seven... What are you doing? Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Listen to me carefully... You're still somewhere in there. I just know that. And you're coming with me. Listen, I have a flash drive with solid evidence. Look. Look. You have to come with me. Well? Target eliminated. Everyone back to the main entrance. Please. Lara... please. Seven, come here with that flash drive. Seven... Seven... Seven... You keep this. Sam? Sam. Sam, can you hear me? Easy, easy, easy. I know where to go. Hand it over. Seven, it's over. The flash drive. Lara... Don't do this. It's me. Don't bother. Your Lara is gone. Move. Lara... Seven, take it easy. - Well, well. The prodigal son. You kept it up for a long time. My compliments. But it's better not to resist any longer. - Hold on. I'll check the flash drive first. Very clever. What's wrong? The terminal says that a large amount of emails were not sent out properly... Who is it that sent something? They didn't arrive, did they? - No. At least, not those ones. He sent the footage to everyone. - Not to everyone. Only to all the customers of the ten largest providers. Eight, eliminate him. Lara... Lara! Lara... Lara... It's me. - Sam. Chip 8 malfunction Eight... What the fuck? Louis. Are you OK? Sam. Louis. Good to see you, man. You too. Seven... Where are you going? My name is Sam. This is Lara. This is Louis. We're going home. By now, the astounding footage has already gone viral. A confused teen who claims to commit assaults in your name. Who on God's earth will ever believe that? Prime Minister Sassen and Mrs. Vermunt were arrested on suspicious of... A day after the collapse of the cabinet the former Prime Minister was arrested. The lead player of this sensational scandal, known by the name Seven... ...will remain anonymous for now. The question is: When will he come forward to make himself known?
