If mom was alive, she'd never go with another man. Make a wish. If you want it to come true, don't tell anyone. CHILDISH GAMES What time is it? Early. You can sleep a little more if you want, OK? You could have stayed longer. Nobody's expecting you so soon, Laura. At home? What's wrong with it? Just no. Come here... - No. - Come on... - Are you OK? - Yes. I just can't be bothered with being questioned, having to explain... But I really feel like going back. Yeah... seeing my kids. What? Hey! How pretty! - Thanks. How are you? - Good. Joana, you should have handed this in yesterday or the day before... Daniel. It's me, Mario. What did the gynecologist say? Well, they still don't know what's wrong with me, what the problem is, and they have to do more tests. - And how's Daniel taking it? - No, Daniel's great. Wonderful. - Have you thought about adoption? - I'd like to try again. So tell me, Mario, what can I do for you? You never thought about me all these years? Well no, to tell the truth, no. And about her? No. - I don't have much time. - Finding you wasn't easy. What? What do you want? Just to ask you a favor. I need you to come home. I just want you to see her. Sorry, you want me to see who? My daughter. - Why do you want me to see her? - I want you to talk to her. About what? What happened. It was an accident, right? Tell her. That's long over, Mario. Clara is dead. Yeah. Why did you have to come? Because I'm alone. And you're the only person I can talk to about it. Listen to me, Mario, if... if you really want help, what you need is to talk to a doctor. - No, Daniel, please... - No, listen, listen to me... only a doctor can help you. Now I have to go, I've got a class. But I wish you all the luck. You have to meet her, then you'll understand. OK, see you later. See you! Who was that? Last time I saw him we were kids. I don't know how he found me. What did he want? I don't know. But he's a bit of a mental case. - See you later. - OK. Robert, Albert, the same two always looking out the window! - Come on, let's go! - Wait! Daniel, we're finished. What do we do now? I'm thinking about it. What are you doing here? Nothing, thinking. Good things? What were you thinking? Today... today a boy offered to be my son... Right. Yes, he wanted to come home with me. I asked him what... his parents would think and he said they'd be better off without him. Well maybe he's right. It was so nice because he squeezed my hand hard... I don't know... it was like he was adopting me. - Let's go to the bedroom? - No, here. Look, here... and now your back... Oh, you scared me! - Sorry I'm late. - Don't worry, it's fine. - You can go, I'll put her to bed. - OK. - See you tomorrow, OK? - OK. Bye. - Good night. - Good night. Hi. A noun's a person place or thing, Or sometimes even times, like spring. A verb tells what the subject does, Like "jumps" or "fishes" or "is" or "was". Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Well I'm glad, what can I say? Really... I'll be more at ease in class... I'd like him to stay If we're not here to educate, what are we here for? This is a failure. We have to discuss this more, how to solve con?icts. Laura, isn't he the guy from the other day? Well Alex is there because the kid can be here. We can't ostracize the boy either. Isn't that the weirdo you were talking to the other day? "The author of "Ogres" dies" Chus, can we concentrate on this? In any case I think it should be a precedent for when a similar case... .Hi! .Hi! - How was the trip? - Very good. You must be Mario, right? Are you going to be our new daddy? - Would you like that? - If you want. Come on, let's go. - Hey, let's go or what? - Yeah, I'll be right out. That was shocking news about your friend. Yeah. Who was he? Actually I hardly knew him. We spent a summer together when I was 9 or 10. My dad was going to marry his mom. - And did they get married? - No... no. There was an accident later. Mario had a younger sister. And... one day we went for a walk in the woods... and the girl fell into a ditch. We tried to get her out but she was dead. Jesus. That's awful, isn't it? And I hadn't seen him since then. They canceled the wedding, we lost track of them. Why didn't you tell me before? What for? Isn't it weird he came to see you after so long? What did he want? For me to go see his daughter. - He had a daughter. - Yes, well that's what he said. Jesus... - And are you going to see her? - No, what he said didn't make much sense. I practically threw him out and told him to go see a doctor. - What were you going to say... - Right... - Let's go? - We could go to the funeral. Yeah, I don't know. Today is a day tinged with sadness. We have lost a young man who was loved by all who knew him. And a little girl has lost a father at the time she needed him most. It is a specially sad day because the death of our brother Mario fills us doubly with both pain and grief. Because it is not man who is to decide about life, not even his very own... nor darkness nor desperation. Look who's here, want to dance? Let's see how you dance. Wow, we're going to fall. Come on, it's bedtime. I'm afraid to sleep alone. Wait. Afraid? What are you afraid of? Of monsters. Monsters, monsters don't exist. There's no monster here. Where'd you get that? - Look. This ribbon is magical! - Really? Yes. Hey, that ribbon was mom's! Mom would have liked Clara to wear it. Look, I'm going to teach you a song and singing it your fears vanish. - What's it called? - Dictation, but you have to concentrate hard and not think about anything else, OK? Repeat after me. A noun's a person place or thing, A noun's a person place or thing, Or sometimes even times, like spring. Or sometimes even times, like spring. A verb tells what the subject does, A verb tells what the subject does. Like. H'I: 1 or In is Or wwas like. H'I: 1 or In is Or wwas Very good! Hello. Hi, are you a relative? No, not at all. I thought you were her... No, I'm her guardian. She's with me until they decide what to do. - Hi, how are you? I'm Daniel. - Hi, Beatriz. Hi, I'm Laura. Can I give you a kiss? Hey, do you remember Beatriz? The social worker, who gave us her card the other day... Well you asked her for it. What about her? No, just... that I called her to see how the girl was. Looks like nobody's claimed her yet. Know what? I think it would be easy to get temporary guardianship, you know? Until someone, a relative, claims her or something. And you're thinking about us. What? - Well that can't happen. - Why not? Because it can't. How can we take care of that girl? - We were going to have a baby. - Say what? - We were going to have a baby. - That has nothing to do with it. I don't know, I'm just saying if she needs to be taken care of then we can do it. What are you laughing about? Yeah, sure, sounds fine. But why does it have to be us? You knew her dad, you were friends. - I barely knew him. - Didn't he ask for help? Daniel... I'm just saying that if she's at one of those centers, she might as well be here. We have a room. It's temporary. It's temporary, we'll just go and ask. Please... It's important to you? Why? Because it is. What? Look at yourself. See how pretty? Hi. They'll treat you well, you'll see. Come on. - Goodbye. - Bye. Well we're here. Come on in. This is our home, you like it? Come. I'll show you the living room. You like it? Yes, no? You'll be just fine here, honey. You'll see. Oh, look, look, these books are for you. Do you like them? Aren't you hot? Shall I take this off? Come, come here... I put her things in her room. Do you want to sit here with me and read? Come, we should see the rest of the house, OK? Come on, come on, I'll show you your room. That's Daniel's bike. Mine's broken. Come. This is the bathroom. What's wrong? You see?, it's OK. Let's see this one. It's beautiful too, I love it. Oh, look, you have colored pencils. Do you feel like drawing? Do you like to draw? Oh look, your teddy bear is so beautiful. It's not a bear, it's a dog. It's a dog? And what's your dog's name? Does it have a name? His name's Tomas. Tomas. That's great, I really like it. Tomas. Do you two need any help? Well... it doesn't look like it. - Then I'll leave you alone. - OK, see you. Hi. I told her a story. Yeah... Laura, it's a temporary guardianship, that's it. Be careful, because they'll come for her. Did you hear me? But now she's with us. I'll take care of her. I'm exhausted. OK. You draw very well. They're for mom, I make 1 every day. Yeah? Can I see? - Tic-tac-toe. - Your tum. And this one? Well this morning when we went to the beach, they left me behind and wouldn't play with me. Later, they climbed up on a rock... in the sea. - It's dangerous! - Then stay there. I don't want to stay by myself... Well get over it! Mario! Daniel! They'd hidden from me and I got really scared. When I found them they were smoking. And then they got mad at me and they wanted to throw me into the water. Well OK, have a good weekend. Do your homework, OK? - OK, bye. - Ciao. Laura! Laura, come. Look, shes Julia's mother. Hi! - I'm Olaya's mom. - A pleasure. Oh, OK. Olaya's birthday party is on Saturday. We'd love you to come. - Where are you going? - To help you. Why don't you help Julia with her homework? Daniel... Do you have a lot of homework? Do you want me to help you? Do you like your new school? What's up, why are you looking at me that way? I know who you are. You do? And who am I? You're Daniel. Of course I'm Daniel, I already told you that. I knew it from before. Your dad spoke to you about me? And who are you? Tell me. Who are you? You already know. Julia, do you know what to get Olaya for her birthday? No? Well if you want, tomorrow I'll call her mom and ask, OK? How's the homework going? We're just about to start. We shouldn't go in there. If you don't want to, stay there. - Where are we going? - To look for snails. Wow, look, look, look. - And so deep! - Yeah, let's go down? Let's go. What are you afraid of? The dead. The dead can't get out of there, dummy. - How do you know? - Look, a dead guy's hand! I'm not scared. Oh, no? You're not scared? Then go on down. The cake, the cake! Harder, harder! - Very good! - Bravo! For Julia! - I dont have any! - Just a minute. I'm going to give you some... There's enough for everyone... Don't worry, don't worry. A toad! Don't kill it! There's a toad! Be careful! It's a really toady toad! - It's a big one, huh? - Yeah. - Hey, let's go? - If you want, sure. Before you go, Olaya has clothes that'll fit Julia What? Stuff that's too small for Olaya and it's almost new. Mr. Federico. Mr. Federico killed his wife... Can you get Julia? He cut her up and put her to fry. As people went by they smelled the stench. It was Mr. Frederico? wife. Mr. Frederico loss' his cash, getting married to e seamstress. - The seamstress lost her thimble... - Clara! What? We're leaving. OK. Mr. Federico Mr. Federico killed his wife, he cut her up and put her to fry... You see what a good time she had? God, she's so cute. I bet she hasn't gone to many parties. What, another drink? Yeah, do you mind? No, no. Of course not. Did you realize her clothes are too small on her? No, the truth is I didn't... Yeah, no... but I should have realized, shouldn't I? I dress her every day and didn't... What? You like parties so little, huh? - I'm going to sleep... - OK, I'll be right there. Hey, why did you call her Clara? Yeah, at the end, you called her Clara. I don't know. Don't be long. Where are you coming from all covered in mud? And where's Clara? She said she was bored and went back. - When? - Right after we left. How could you leave your sister? Go to your room right now. Clara! Clara! Clara! Clara! Clara! Clara! Clara! Clara! What are you doing? Did you hear her laugh? She's so cute! Don't you feel you're taking this too far? - What? - The girl and everything. Julia. Yes, Julia. She's not your daughter. Yeah, I know that, OK. Well it doesn't seem like it hearing you talk. It's temporary. To forget that's not good for you, and especially not good for her. Who knows, her mom died when she was two, maybe... But that doesn't make you her mom, Laura. Yeah, and? What do you propose? What are you saying? Keep the girl at a distance, be cold to her? No, be aware they might take her away, that's all. - It seems you'd like that, right? - Don't say that... Well I do. No, if you wanted to adopt there are ways to do it. Don't get attached to a girl they might take away. Now she's here with us, isn't she? We'll take care of her, I'm taking care of her. That's all... Calm down. We're just talking. Yes? Hi, just a second. Yeah, what is it? Yes, sorry, yes, go on. Who was it? Chus. She wants me to go with her somewhere this afternoon - Can't it wait? - No it can't, it can't. So, you go with Daniel, OK? Hi, take my hand? Take my hand. That's it. - I'll see you later. - OK, ciao. Can you bathe yourself? Well OK, let's go. - Hi. - Hi. So it's just you? Yes, Daniel's working. Can you tell me what's up? Yes. - They claimed her already. - Yes, exactly. And what now? What do we have to do? Well. We have to wait. You knew this could happen, Laura, didn't you? Yes... - Temporary guardianship, huh? - Right, sure... Do you mind if we go? Let's go. We can continue talking. But I'm dying for a smoke. Listen, how does Daniel get along with her? Well, really great, yeah... I mean, sometimes it's hard for him to be with her. I have to push him a bit but... Being with her is hard. Well, it makes him a little tense but I guess that's normal, - Yes, don't worry, he's jealous What? No, Daniel is jealous Yes, men are like that, possessive and insecure. Pay more attention to him. Don't let him know that the girl's more important to you now than him. Maybe, I don't know. So when does she have to go? Don't be in such a hurry. It's just a processed request. That's all. - Whose? - I can't tell you that. Beatriz... No, no, even if I knew I couldn't tell you... Laura. Laura. Think about how much good you've done her. How nice it's been for her with you. Nobody can take that away. Look, Beatriz, I could understand her having to go. But not someone taking her who doesn't deserve her. No, of course not. She went through hell, she's better off with us. Come see her at home, OK? - I know she's... - Nobody's come to see her. - I know that. - And she's doing so well. She laughs, likes school, likes me... Laura, I know she's doing great with you. - You don't, because you haven't... - Trust me. As soon as I hear... Keep her in mind. We do keep her in mind. And you too. OK? I want you to relax. Trust us. Trust us. I'll call you, OK? Don't worry. Julia, Are you OK? Julia? I'm almost finished. I'll go fix dinner. OK. - Can I watch TV? - Yes. Hello? Hi, it's me. How are you? No, I just wanted to talk to you. No, no, fine, what's up? Nothing, I wanted to say I know you're right about a lot of things. Ls something wrong? Hey. No, no, we'll talk about it when I get home. Up to you... OK, wait, can I talk to Julia? No, no, she's taking a bath, she can't pick up. Oh, OK. Then can you tell her...? I have to hang up. See you soon. Julia! What kind of game is this, Julia? Julia! Daniel? What are you doing? Why'd you lock yourself in? - I didn't... - And the girl? I don't know. Julia? Hi. How are you, OK? Watching TV? - Did you have dinner yet? - No. Why were you hiding? What? So you were hiding, huh? Where did that ribbon come from? Oh, look! It's so pretty! Who gave it to you? It's a secret. It's magical. So it's a magic ribbon. Well it looks great on you. - Thank you. - Doesn't it? No, I don't like her wearing it. Why do you say that? It's so pretty, isn't it? Why, why, Daniel? You're scaring her. What's wrong? No, if you don't like it, leave! Get out! You hear me? You're scaring her. Are you OK? Sure? - Your ribbon's very pretty. - Thanks. Yes, very pretty. What's wrong? - What's wrong? - Nothing. No? It's her, Daniel. It's her, Daniel. It's her. What's wrong? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What happened? What's the girl doing here? She's scared so I got her. What's wrong? Nothing, tum off the light. - Are you OK? - I'm fine, I'm fine. - Are you sure? I'm sure. Turn off the light Laura. - Hi. - How are you? - Forgive me. - I'm sorry... It was my fault. No... no, no. I was just very nervous, Daniel I'm sorry, really, but I'd just come from... well I'll tell you later, but I'm sorry. We need to talk. I want to tell you something. Then tell me. Look at her, I mean... What's up with you? Why are you so late? - I went to get something. - You did? What? - A folder. - Really? So you have it? I'm going to walk home, do you mind? - Huh? - Nothing. OK. And this, wait. Can I leave this? Are you OK? Me too. Come on, a little more. Dude, we're leaving. The bar's closed. You have to go. Where? What do you mean where? Go home, go somewhere but we're closed. I'm sorry. Daniel. I want to see them a minute, right now. What did you do to Clara? What did you do to my daughter? You monsters. How could you do this to her? Monster, you monster! What did you do to her? Answer! What did you do to her? You monster! What did you do to Clara? You monster! Clara! Who are you? What are you doing? Get out of here now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I had a lot to drink. What were you doing in her room? You wouldn't understand. Why? Is it so horrible or what? No, some things can't be explained, that's all. Right. But Daniel, try to please, because... I don't understand anything. It's Julia, she makes me remember things I thought I'd forgotten. What's that got to do with entering her room drunk at 4 in the morning, Daniel? I think she wants to hurt me. How? You realize that makes no sense? It doesn't, none, but it's happening. What? What's happening? Julia does things she shouldn't do, things Clara did, the girl that died. Clara... what you called her at the party. And she answered. How do you explain it? Because she recognized your voice, She recognized it, knew you meant her and turned... The ribbon she had on was the same one Clara had when she died. How long ago was that? - Many years, right? - Yes. You were a kid and now you think it's the same ribbon but it's not, it's your imagination. No it's not. Her father came to see me because she scared him. Her father was scared of everything. In Julia's case he had his reasons. What are you saying, that you think she's a ghost? Daniel... Daniel, listen. The girl's had a very rough time. You know it. She lived with a sick man and I won't let anyone harm her again. You hear me? So if you really think she's a ghost or the reincarnation of a dead girl, you need to make an appointment with a psychiatrist. I don't believe in ghosts. You just said she wanted to hurt you. No, no, no. I just said she reminds me of painful things and it's not at all easy for me. I'm trying, but I just cant. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it won't happen again. I'm sorry. Hey, I'm the one who's sorry. I'm sorry, I hadn't thought about you. You and I never spend time together. Why don't we go to the country? Sure... Chus will lend us her house. Let's go. Let's rest, we can relax... Alone? Yes, just the three of us. OK. Are you OK? Yes. Come on. This is it. Let's see. - So, you like it? - Yes. Pretty, huh? Look how nice the house is. Put this on, it's cold. Look, we came from over there. Up that road. Yes. OK. - It's a little cold, isn't it? - Yes. What, for lunch? You're hungry again? You just had breakfast. Whatsit we do this weekend? Well, we'll stay here... - Here, can you put them there? - OK. Where do I sleep? In a room upstairs, I'll show you later. I'm afraid of sleeping alone. Why's that? You're not alone, we're in the next room, don't be scared. Here, take this too. Hey, where's your magic ribbon? I put it away. - What's its magic? - It protects you against monsters. What? Now wait a minute, but there are no monsters. Julia. - Are there monsters here? - Well, sometimes. Is that why your dad gave it to you? It wasn't him. Then who gave it to you? I can't say, it's a secret. Come on... come on, it's so they can give me one too, please. - Are you scared too? - Well sure, sometimes. I'll lend you mine. Daniel, let's go! Julia! An anthill Come on or you'll get lost. Julia! Coming! Careful. Can I go look for?owers? Flowers? Sure. Don't go too far away, OK? - OK. - OK. You're going that way? Yes. It seems someone's claimed her. She'll have to go. How do you know? I spoke to Beatriz the other day. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I should have told you. I know, I'm sorry. - When's she going? - They don't know yet. - So it's not for sure? - Yes, yes, yes. If it's a relative she'll have to go. We knew it could happen, right? They said it was temporary. - It's what you wanted. - No, no, no, no, I just want you to be OK. - This will be hard for me. - I know. But we're together, huh? Same as before, everything will be OK. How's it going? Well the wood's not very dry. Yeah, well we are dry and stiff, aren't we? It would be easy with pine cones. We can look tomorrow. - OK. - Om OK. Let's see... is it working now? - It's beautiful, isn't it? You like it? - Yes. When I was a girl, my dad always made fires. Yes, it's true, he'd get a big bunch of dry sticks and leaves. And he'd make a big fire that went way up. We'd have to move back from the heat. It's true. It scared me a little but I really liked it. Do you have a tissue? - Can you let me get one? - Yes. Careful not to get too close, OK? What's up, what are you laughing at? What's so funny? It didn't scare you or what? It didn't scare you? - No. - Oh, no? - No. - Why not? I have a trick. You have a trick. Show me. You have to sing a song. Really? But any song will do? - No, only one works. - Then show it to me. - It's called Dictation. - Dictation, let's hear it. A noun's a person place or thing, Or sometimes even times, like spring. A verb tells what the subject does, Like "jumps" or "fishes" or "is" or "was". Very good, very good Dictation. A noun's a... a person place or thing, person place or thing, A verb tells what A verb tells what the subject the subject does. Very good. Look, my tooth is moving. I know that song too. It's of no use at all. Want some help? No, stay there, OK? It's full of dust... Are there bugs? Bugs? I'm sure there are bugs here. The baskets are here. Look, maybe this one. It might be good, right? Isn't it too small? Small? No way! - We can play who finds more if you want. OK. I'm going to win. Yeah? Hello? I can't hear you, wait. I know a place with lots of pine cones. Who was it? Beatriz. Hey, why don't you look for more pine cones, OK? Come on, I'll be there, I bet there's lots over there. Hurry. Any news? Well yes. Yes, there might be a possibility. - Of what? - Of us keeping her. Oh, that's great. Great. What's the deal? What happened? I don't know. She said she'll tell us when she sees us and she'd like it to be today. Today? That sucks, right? Can't it wait until we return? I don't know. She said if we want to take advantage of the opportunity we have to hurry, I don't know. I don't know, I don't know what to say. - You prefer her to go? - No. Tell me what to do. You decide. I think the girl needs us. Then that's that. - Go. - You really don't mind? - No, I don't mind. - You're sure? I'm sure. I'll stay here with her. Thank you. Wait! - Take me with you. - I can't, honey. - Don't leave me alone. - But you're not alone. Please. Look, this is what we'll do. I'll bring you some cake when I come back, OK? - What kind do you want? - Chocolate. Chocolate, OK. Hurry, go to Daniel. When you want we'll go get pine cones. I'm tired. I thought you were so excited about it. I have things to do. - You want me to help you? - You don't need to. UP to you. - Laura. - Hi. Look, this is doctor Moreno. - Nice to meet you. - You too. Let's go to my office? OK. So I'm all ears. Let's see, it's very simple. You'll meet the lady who wanted Julia's custody. It's her grandmother. Her grandmother? Then she has a right to her, or not? Yes, no one questions her right, but her ability. Luisa didn't request her granddaughter's custody, but her daughter's and she died as a girl. We're trying to find a solution that leaves Julia out of it. Before this becomes a legal problem. Sorry, I don't really understand you. You could be a good foster family and also guarantee she has controlled visits with her grandmother. We were actually convinced that Mario had no family. In a way that's true. His mother blamed him for his sister's death and refused to see him again. That's awful. Until she saw him one last more when Mario took the girl to meet her grandmother, who she'd never seen before. Hi. Come. Where have you been? Clara. My name's... Clara. From that day on, the girl would come spend some afternoons with her grandmother. - Who is it? - That's you. - This is me? - It's you, Clara. It's time to go. - Bye. - Goodbye. Be very careful with the monsters. At first we thought it was fine, but as time went on we saw Luisa stood by her idea that Julia was her dead daughter. Of course we asked Mario to stop bringing her for a while and that was that. We lost track of him until the ruling came and we found out what happened. And if Luisa is cured? Patients are usually here a week, two months. I've been for 20 years and Luisas always been too. In and out, but always here. And what can I do? Well, talk to her. We'll avoid a long process if you reach an agreement. Shall we? Luisa is waiting for you. Luisa, this is Laura. Laura, Luisa. - Hello. - It's a pleasure. I'll leave you alone so you can talk. How is the child? Good, she's very good. She has a new school and friends. She's happy. She's always been very sociable and warm. Yes, yes, she's very warm. Yes. I set things aside for her, could you take them to her? Sure, sure, of course. Here are all her things, waiting for her. I'll tell her. They say you want to keep the child. Yes, well, we'd like to take care of her and... help her. I could do that too. This isn't the best place for a girl, is it? Have you asked her? She's never mentioned this place to me. Because it's our secret. She draws them for me. One each day, she must have tons put away. And this is Clara, right? Your daughter. This isn't the girl in my care. It doesn't matter what others want to call Clara. No, no, her name's Julia and she's your granddaughter. And if that were true... they took her from me. Who else knows you're Clara? Did you tell Laura? And why not? Because no one's supposed to know. You can't stay here. You have to go. But I want to stay. You can't stay. I won't tell Laura who you are. Who am I? You're one of the monsters. And what do you want from me? For you to go away. No. Where is Clara? - Don't call her Clara. - Did you leave Clara alone? Her name's Julia. Julia, and it's her right to know who she is. Clara's alone and shouldn't be. Her name's Julia, she's not alone and you're not her mother. She should be near her family. But we're the closest to a family she's ever had. - Only I can save her. - From who? The monster. I can too. I can too. Open the door!;Let me out! Please! Open the door! - Thank you. - You're welcome. - See you later. - Be careful. Hey! Bring Julia around. I also have a right to see her, don't I? Yes. - See you later. - See you. Hello? Daniel? Julia! Hi.. Hi, I thought you weren't here. How'd it go? Fine... I have to tell you a lot of things. Where's Julia? - I think she fell asleep. - Really? - How's that? Is she sick? - No, no. Then what? And this? What were you doing to be covered in dirt? Stuff I had to finish. Are you going to tell me? Yes. First let me go see Julia. - She's not in her room. - And where is she? Sleeping, I just told you. Julia! Julia! Laura? Laura, I'm in here! Help me! I'm scared! Laura! Please! I'm scared, help me! - Daniel, what's going on? - Nothing. It's all good. Julia! Pssst, she's not Julia, she's Clara Julia is sleeping. - No, no, she's not Clara. - Yes. No, Clara's dead. Clara's... Get off! Julia! Laura! I'm in here! Laura! - Are you OK? - Yes. It's OK, honey. Don't worry. It's OK, don't worry, it's OK. Laura! Laura! Are you there? Laura! Help me! Laura! Laura, help me! Laura! Don't leave me here... I'll be back. Where's Laura? She was tired, she had to go to bed. That's not true, you're bad. Leave me alone! Laura! Leave me alone! Laura! Leave me alone! - Clara. - What? Before you go away for good, I want to tell you something. We didn't mean to hurt you, it was an accident. I've suffered a lot for what happened. I never told anyone, but I've thought about you each day of my life. I think I've already paid a high price for this. You can forgive me, right? Yes, I forgive you. Yes? Thank you. Thank you. Now you have to go because we don't need you any more and you have no right to come back. It's better for you to go. But I don't want to go. Are you going down? So I'm down. - Yeah? Now lie down. - Let me out. Not until you lie down. Mario. Help me. Come on, let's let her out. No, no, no, she has to learn. Come on, sing, Clara, sing. Daniel! Julia! Daniel! Come on, Clara, sing. Sing, Clara, sing. Come on, Clara, sing. No, no, no, no. Where are you going? Come on, I can't hear you, louder! A noun's a person place or thing Where are you going? You're not getting out of there! Clara! Daniel. Clara! - Daniel, what are you doing? - What are you doing here? - Stay away! Stay away... - Laura! - Julia! Julia... - Laura, I'm here! - It's over, it's over. Are you OK? - Yes. - It's over, it's over. - She's not Julia. Yes she's Julia, Daniel. She's Julia. Yes. She's a girl. A girl who I swear... I swear I'll never forgive you if you hurt her. No, I'll never forgive you. She's the one that's hurting us, Laura. No, Daniel, no, no, no. Listen to me. I was with her grandmother today. Huh? With Luisa. She treated her like she was Clara, get it? She treated her like she was Clara! - She is Clara. - She's not, Luisa's sick. - Listen, she's Clara. - Luisa's sick. You hear? But we can help her, do you understand? And help Julia too. OK? - You were talking to Clara's mom? - Yes. So you know. What? That I'm a monster. - No. - Yes, yes he is. Yes, yes I am. Let us by. - Let us by. - Not her. Let us by, Daniel! Not her!
