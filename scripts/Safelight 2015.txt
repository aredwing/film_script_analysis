Stupid, you are my whore. - You are. - Hey! What the fuck you gonna do with that, man? You know this kid? God damn if you don't have balls. You're a fucking cripple, man. You can't do shit. He's fucking with me. You're goddamn... No, you're fucking crazy, man. You're... Whoa! Hey, calm down, boy. Come on. Don't get all worked up. Look, look. It's okay. Look at that, huh? She's fine. I got my money. All right? Huh? Go to work. I fuckin' love you. You want to hear some muscle? Oh, yeah! Next time, bubba. You can put that down now. I have to go. Photographs don't lie. In a darkroom, film comes to life. The filters and paper, an image appears, capturing a moment in time. What happens before and after that moment? That can unnerve me. Check the bag. Is it there? No, it's not. You think you're better than us, huh, retard? And now you take a picture of my girl? Only in the hallway. She wanted to pose. You'll never take a picture of my girlfriend again! Don't look at her! Don't even talk to her! You got that, scumbag? Crippled piece of shit. Dad? Dad, I'm home! I gotta go. I'll see you later. Thanks. Bye. Hey, let me get two packs of Marlboros. Get your sorry little asses out of here. You think we're gonna break the law? Hey, you see this? Don't you criminals know how to read? It says you gotta be 18, see? What's your problem, lady? - My problem? - Yeah. Oh, Charles, hold me back. I'm gonna get myself thrown in the slammer again. You're crazy. Come here, you little piece of shit. Come here! Come here! Man! Yes! Oh, there's only one thing worse than little punks. What's that? Truck drivers who try to pick up pretty middle-age convenience store owners. Hi. Hey. Your friend's here. Shh. Is a pretty little thing. Yeah, she's really pretty. Mm-hmm. It's, um, 25 cents, hon. You can keep it. Uh, thank... thank you. Bye. Bye. Hey, it's okay to have a crush on her. Oh, Peg! Come on. No. Hey, I can tell, angel. Hey, Vicki! So the theme could be anything you like. Well, let's remember to keep some clothes on our subjects, okay? - Ryan. - But, Mr. Sullivan, what if they want to take their clothes off? Now if anyone wants to enter the contest, here. Pick up one of these applications as you leave. Just let me know. Just... No... I had the bat, and I was like... I was like, "Leave her alone." It was... It was insane. Wh-What was her name again? - Vicki. - Vicki? Yeah. She kind of like... Truck stop's like her... like her hangout... Hmm. or... You know, when I went out there, I felt like a regular guy, I mean, like I did what... I did what most guys would do, you know. Hmm. Well, actually, I think, uh... Listen, most guys would not have done what you did. I'm proud of you. Well, it did feel pretty good. When I went back inside, I felt like an alien again. Hey, Charles, uh, we are gonna have to start talk... Stop. What do you want now? Oh, I just... I just came by to just see how you're doing. Anyway, last night... Last night, I was... I was a little bit out of control, huh? Yeah. You were losing it. Yeah. Can I come in? No. What you fucking thinking? I'm sorry. What do you want? I don't know. I just want to make up. Can we just kiss and make up now? Come on. We're good, okay? Mm-hmm. I'm good. Hmm? Yeah. You want to get a beer? Yeah? - Can I get you a beer? - Yeah. Okay. You know I could take all this away from you, right? Yeah. Yeah, I know that. But then what would I do without you? I don't know. I don't know. - Thanks. - Thank you. Oh, angel, have I ever told you how much I love making coffee? Yeah, only about a million times. I have got it down to a science. One rounded tablespoon per cup. Not mug, cup. And I only use this tablespoon. You should throw that thing out or at least wash it. Someone's gonna get sick. Darlin', have you lost your mind? This here is Grammy Ev's sterling silver, and it makes the perfect cup, and you know it, because you love my coffee. Admit it! I know. I know. It'd be easier just to pour in the grounds. Well, speed's not gonna make it turn out good. Anyway, this is an art, believe me. You've had your dad's coffee, right? Ugh. It's worse than Sanka. Well, hello. Look who's here. You know, some men just can't take a hint that a lady is not interested. Heh. Hey, there, Charles. Hey, Jack. Hello, sunshine. Now, Jack... She'll come around. I hope so. Is that Jack Campbell trying to act all sweet again? Ooh. Ho ho. Now, there are those crystal-green eyes that I have been just dreaming about since Jacksonville. They're hazel, actually. For you, ma'am. Oh, roses. How imaginative. There you go. Boy, you are one tough cookie. You know that, sunshine? You know, you can buy me all the flowers in California. I'm still not going out with you. Jack, I have learned a few things in my life. Have you, now? Oh, yeah, yeah. 20 years as a hairdresser, I think, qualifies me as an expert on people. - I like your hair. - Three divorces, I think that qualifies me as an expert on men. And one trucker husband who dragged me to this shithole of a town definitely qualifies me as an expert on truckers, so hit the road, Jack. One dance. Baby, you just give me one dance, and I will erase every bad thought you ever had about men. Oh, yes, I will. That's right, Charles. Ooh, like a cat. Light on my feet, baby. No. Look at these moves, huh, baby. A little dip right there. Oh, yeah, I may be stocky, but I am agile. Hi. Hi. It's a quiet night, huh? Yeah. Um... it's pretty late. Yeah. You want a cup of coffee? Sure. Half and half with three sugars, please. It's perfect. It's really good. No, no, no. It's on the house. Oh. Thank you. Gonna go. Heh. Bye. So, did you enter that photo contest at school? Nah. I'm still trying to come up with a theme. Kevin always said you took your best shots outside. I don't know. I'm not even sure I'm gonna enter. I'm telling you, Charles. One day... - I know. Stardom. - Stardom. Stardom. Hey, remember those... remember those shots you took of me on my Harley with Kevin? Those? Oh, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. I still have those. Yeah, it was... Yeah. Oh, you used to love riding, didn't you? Oh, man, I felt alive on my bike. Yeah, I wouldn't mind having that feeling again. Look, I am losing fuel fast. I might just... I'm gonna crash. Okay? Mm. Time to get you to bed, cowboy. I got him. I got him. All right. Come on. All right. Thanks. You sure you don't wanna eat something else? - No, no. Thanks. - All right. Good night, Charles. Night, Dad. Careful. Cold. Can you believe Jack? I'm telling you, I can't stop thinking about him. The man just never gives up. I thought you were done with men. Oh, I... I am, angel. I am. I am. He's not gonna fool me. Don't worry. They're all sweet and lovey at the beginning, and then they turn into Mr. Hyde right before your very eyes. Well, I don't get my hopes too high either. Oh, come on. Don't say that. What? Girls don't like me. What are you talking about? You just haven't met enough. It's too early to give up. You gotta be old and wrinkled like me. Then you can be cynical, okay? - Okay. - Okay. "Girls don't like me"? - Girls don't like me. - Oh, come on. They will. Trust me. They'll knock down your door. - Right. - They are. Yeah, right. - Hi. - Hi. What's going on? Nothing. What's that? It's nothing. Just... Well, it looks like something. Let me see. It's really nothing. I didn't know you were a photographer. I'm... I'm not. It says here it's a photography contest. It's just more of a hobby kind of. - A hobby, huh? - Yeah. So what are you gonna take pictures of for your hobby contest? Well, I was thinking, um, if I do end up entering the contest, that I would... I would do the California lighthouses. That's cool. It's really cool. Yeah. One major problem, though. I... I really need a ride to get there, and I can't drive, and... What if I take you? What? No, that's not what I was driving at. I know. I want to. What about tomorrow? It's a Sunday. I'm free during the day. Plus, I kind of owe you one. Heh. Heh. Okay. Cool. Where do you live? Um, um... where do I live? Forest... Forest Road, the last house on the left. Cool. I'll pick you up, like, 11:00? Yeah. Yeah, that's perfect. Great. Great. Yeah. I'll see you at 11:00. Thank you. What kind of music you into? Oh, I don't really listen to music too much, but I like everything. Country's pretty good. My dad played a lot of country. Sometimes I go to the Cowboy Palace with Peg and her friends. It's that country club down on South Street. - Yeah. - Um... Peg knows the bouncer, so I get in without a problem, and he didn't mind, 'cause he knows I don't drink. You don't drink? I have enough trouble walking when I'm sober. How old are you? 17. How old are you? I just turned 18. I think country's cool. I prefer harder stuff, though. I went to a couple of concerts with Skid before I realized he was a complete lunatic. Yeah. Anyway... I haven't been outside in the daytime for while. I usually like to sleep late and stay in till nighttime. Why don't you go out? I don't know. I don't want people to see me, what I look like and all. Want to take a look? Who's Kevin? My older brother. This is his camera and his stuff. Where's Kevin now? He died. I'm so sorry. No, it's okay. What about your mom? My mom left when I was only a couple years old, just started to walk. At least, tried to walk. Why'd she leave? Me. So it's just you and your dad now? Yeah, my dad's great. He's like my best friend. He's always encouraging me and stuff. It's cool. - Yeah, that's cool. - Yeah. Sounds like a good guy. What about you? Do you have any family? Um... well, my dad's gone, thankfully. And my mom... I haven't seen her since she asked me to hit the road, so... You should probably take the picture. We kind of have to go, right? Yeah. No, no, no! I am done with men, remember? D-O-N-E, done. They're nothing but two-timing, always lying, sex-addicted dogs. I don't mean you, sweetie. Well, I'm sex addicted, too. You know that. Hey, hey! May I remind you that we are sitting with a very young, innocent young man here? Please, watch your fuckin' language. Charles doesn't mind, now, does he? Am I right? Am I right? Like I was saying, guys, men are nothing but trouble. - Oh, oh... - Listen to me, girls. I know from where I speak. Oh, honey, there are still some good men out there, fine men out there. Still some good men. Well, I have met most every man in this state, and I have yet to find a good one. No! The entire state? Oh, she's exaggerating. You guys didn't know me when I was younger. The entire state is not an exaggeration. You might be telling the truth. Oh, let's go. I wanna... Let's move. - Hey, Dottie. Dottie. - Yes, ma'am. Did you forget to wear your underwear again? Well, of course I did. Yee-haw! You okay? Dad! Dad! You okay? Yeah. Yeah. I'm all right. You have fun? Yeah, I guess. Did you dance? You know I can't do that. Hey. Ah, there he is. Hey, Charles. Hey. Hi. Hey. Me and your dad was just hanging out. Yeah, Vicki knows all about cars and Harleys. Cool. I grew up being kind of a tomboy. What can I say? And I love your dad's Chevelle and Harley. They're the coolest. I figured we could go to a lighthouse today. Can't believe how patient you have to be to do this. That's what I love about photography. Anything, really, if you look at it long enough, you get to see what it's really showing you. You know what I think, Charles? I think you're like one of your subjects. You've got lots of faces of your own to show. Why are you so nice to me? Why shouldn't I be? I can't do that. Yes, you can. Okay. You did. Really. Whoo! I'm gonna take your picture. - No. - Ah, come on, smile. Please don't, no. - Yeah, come on, smile. - No, please, don't. Please. - Charles, come on. - Stop! I think it's really cool you're so into photography. I remember when I was a kid, after I found out that girls didn't play for the Dodgers, I got totally into the news, and I started walking around with a tape recorder and a microphone, interviewing my mom and dad and my little sisters. I was really into it. I remember I wanted to be one of those reporters that goes right into the scene of the crime or the accident. I wanted to tell whoever was in trouble or whoever had escaped the fire or whoever's kid had disappeared that everything was gonna be okay... that it was all gonna be okay, you know. And what have I got now? Vicki, can I ask you something personal? Sure. How'd you become a... Heh. Sorry, I don't know... No, it's okay. It's my life. Shit. Uh, well... my asshole father used to like to take his bullshit out on my mom and me and my little sisters. One day, he just disappeared, never came back. I actually managed fine, even when my mom was bringing a different guy home every night. Then one boyfriend moved in, and he took a liking to me real fast, so she kicked us out. He went his way, and I met Skid, and that's pretty much it. How come you chose to take pictures of lighthouses for your contest? Well, one day I remembered that Kevin and I had planned to do a road trip one summer to photograph the lighthouses of California. He really liked the idea of the light guiding people home. Guess you could say my brother liked helping people a lot. How did he die? Vietnam. Shit, that's awful. He was a hero, even won a medal. Wow. It's really cool that you're doing this lighthouse trip with me. I think it's really cool, too. How's the project going with Vicki? Okay, I guess. I got some good shots. Yeah? Vicki's been helping out a lot. Eh, Charles, you ask me, I think she likes you. She just feels bad for me. Ah, come on, Charles. I see how she is with you. She likes being around you. I don't know. Sure. What grade is she in, anyway? She didn't tell you? No. We just talked about cars and motorcycles. She works at the truck stop. What do you mean, "She works at the truck stop"? She "works" at the truck stop. Are you okay with that? Are you okay with that? I think so. I like her. I like her, too, Charles. Stay away from him, Charles. Whoo! Whoo! It's the gimp. What's in the bag? Not your treasured camera? Oh, no. Oh, where you going, huh? Huh? Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? Heh. I'm your worst nightmare. Heh. I don't think you know me very well, do you? Let's go, Charles. Come on. Excuse me, girlie. We ain't done talking to our friend, Charles, just yet. Right, boys? Now why don't you run along before you get hurt? Charles is coming with me. Don't fuck with him again. I may not be the best shot, but I usually hit something. Even if it's small. That was great. That would have made the perfect photo. You should have done your project on high school pussies. Where'd you get the gun? From Skid. Heh. Wait. How'd you get my dad's car? I asked. Hey, grab the wheel. What? Why? Grab the wheel. You can't drive a convertible and not stand and feel the wind in your hair! Whoo! Wow. Okay, it's your turn. Me? Yeah. Come on. Stand up. - You can do it. - All right. Yeah! - Raise your arms. - I can't. Yeah, you can. Ahh! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! How long have you lived here? Like six months now. Skid set me up here. Mm, he likes to know where he can find me. Who are they? Those are my little sisters. Cute. Yeah. Whoa. I'm... I'm so sorry. I didn't... I don't know what I'm doing anymore. Community college is a great place to start. I could take photography? Sure. Your photography work, it holds promise. You think you could help me with an admission application? Absolutely. You know, Charles, I am so thrilled that you are starting to believe in yourself. It's just great. Thanks. You and Vicki are spending a lot of time together, huh? Yeah. Maybe we should talk about relationships, you know, boyfriend, girlfriend stuff. Not now, Dad. Come on. Help me look through these photos. Charles, we still have to talk about what's gonna happen when I'm gone. Wait. What do you think of these two? I think they're great. Yeah? Yeah, these two are winners. Hey, sweetie. We were just talking about you. Were those pretty little ears of yours burning? What were you saying? Go on. What? Well, uh, we were all gonna go dancing tomorrow night at the Cowboy Palace, Me, Charles, and the girls. Jack here can't make it. But, um, we all were wondering if you'd like to come along. It is so much fun. Dancing? Mm-hmm, tomorrow night. Okay, yeah. Sounds like fun. Really? That's great, huh? That'll be fun. You are a breath of fresh air. You know that? No, thank you. This dress is adorable. You look so sweet, sugar. Thank you. Doesn't she look beautiful, Charles? - Yeah. - Girls, have you ever seen such a pretty little thing? Never in my lifetime. Never. Vicki, angel, if I looked like you 35 years ago, I would have found myself a real man. Oh, you would have had the pick of the bunch. It would still be the best of a bad lot. I'd rather have that than the slime buckets we ended up with. Uh-oh. Girls, do you hear that? Time to slow dance. Who do you guys dance with? Each other. We've always wanted men who were as caring and understanding as us, so half of us just pretend to be those men. All right, who's wearing the pants tonight? Me. I did it last week. Oh, my. For what? To dance. Me? Yes! Uh... Come on. Come with me. - Oh... - What? I'll knock if you don't. Wait. Wait! I'm not ready for this. Vicki, come on! We're right here! No, no! No, please. Hi, Lois. Vicki, is it really you? Hi, kid. How's it going? Charles, these are my little sisters. This is Sharon, and this is Kate. Hi. Hi. Hi. So what are you doing out here? Um, I've been helping Charles out with his photography project. We were just in the area. - Are you really a pr... - Kate. So where are you living? Out in the desert. Are you coming home? How's school been? Fine. Yeah, it's okay. Well, it's... it's really good to see you, Vicki. Do you mean that? Of course I mean that. Isn't it, girls? Yeah. Yeah. It's been... Well, let's see. We've known each other for a few years now, right? Mm-hmm. Ever since I brought in my broken-down car into Sears. Good old Eric fixed me up just fine. And then I met Charles, and, well, he just completely stole my heart. - Well, what about me? - Eh, you wish. Nope, Charles is, has been, and always will be the only man for me. Peg got me the job at the truck stop. Oh, really? That's cool. Yep. Vicki, you know, um, Charles showed me a few pictures that he took of you, and I'm telling you, you could be a model. Me? Yeah. You, you are the prettiest little thing. You do photograph very well. Your eyes are beautiful. Yeah. I think you guys are talking about somebody else. No. Hey, what about your parents? Are you close? Um... no. My mom used to tell me that I was a whole lot of trouble and that she didn't know how to handle it, you know. I have two great little sisters, though. It's... It's really great to see you guys together. Yeah, I seriously wouldn't have been able to do this project without you. Vicki, can I ask you something? Yeah. Dad, I still really don't think this is such a good idea. Charles, this cowboy is riding again. Yes! Just don't go too fast, Vicki. Okay. I'll keep it under 100. Will you be careful, please? All right. Okay, hold on, and get ready for the ride of your life! Kick it! Yeah! Hey, Truck Stop! Come here. Come here. Sit down. Sit down. We'll... We'll have a little talk. We'll get to know each other a little bit better. I gotta get to work. Work? Shit. Fuck work. They'll run your ass right in the fuckin' ground. You know that? Come on! Sit down. You know I'm not gonna hurt you, right? Just come on, and sit down. Hell, you might actually take a fuckin' swing at me with that bat of yours. Smoke? No. Good. They'll fuckin' kill you. Where you live, Truck Stop? Uh, just up the road a bit. Damn. That's a long way to walk with that twitch of yours, isn't it? I don't mind. I like walking. Can't drive? Nah. Where your parents at? They just let you fuckin' struggle along like that? Um, well, my dad's kind of sick, and, uh, my mom's not around. Where the fuck she go? She left us. Fuckin' whore. What the fuck kind of mother leaves her kid like that? You know, all women are useless fuckin' whores. You know that, Truck Stop? My mom, she nearly starved my ass every fuckin' week. Didn't even know who the fuck my father was. She'd spread her legs for a hit of acid whenever she could. I should have fuckin' killed that bitch when I had the chance, but I was... I was too fuckin' nervous in those days. Now... I don't have that problem, buddy. Mm. You know, Truck Stop, God damn, you and me... we're a lot alike. We get all the shit that life has to give, all the shit in the world. Sad story, ain't it? How's it going, eh? Aw, fuck it. Good talk. Good talk. I want you to do something for me. Close your eyes. Huh? Close your eyes. Now picture yourself in your dad's car... Just you and me flying down the road, not a care in the world. Now you're standing up just like we did. You remember that? Great. Feel the wind in your hair. You feel free, completely, totally free. That wasn't so hard, was it? I feel really lucky to know you, Charles. When I think about what you... have to go through every day to get to work or school, when I see you using this camera... makes me believe I can do something with my life, truly. Thank you for that. I'm gonna miss this, the lighthouses... coming up here. Maybe there'll be another contest, though. Smile! No. It's about the lighthouses, not me, Charles. Ready for your close-up? No. Heh heh. Remember that summer, Vicki? Yeah. That was fun. Sure was. You girls were such a handful. Did you guys hike a lot? Yeah. We love to sleep outside. Look at that. That's our tent. Wow. Yeah. That's where we slept every weekend when we didn't go away. Yeah, it was great. - In your yard? - Yeah. We couldn't get them back in the house. It... Tent was like their little home. Is that Dad? No, it's... What is your problem? My problem is you're a whore! You should shut the fuck up. You have no idea what you're talking about. I know what you did. Everyone does! We just don't talk about it ever. Do we, Mom? You really thought I wanted to be fucking that guy? Deep down, you knew. You okay? It'll be all right. No! No, it won't! I should never have listened to you. I went through all of that shit, Charles, for what? W-Why? 'Cause you wanted to see your family. No, I didn't. I don't ever want to see them again. I wish I could just erase these past few weeks. You don't mean that. I only hung out with you because I felt bad for you. You should know that. Still no sign of her, huh? No. It's been three days. Did you go by her place? Yeah. Well, there ain't nothing harder to do than face your ghosts, you know. I know. She's a tough girl, Charles. Now don't you let this go getting you down. Come on. Gotta have faith, right? You gotta keep believing in yourself. You're a great kid, Charles. Just hope she's all right. - I know. I know. - She... I know one thing. She doesn't want to see me. Oh, no, you don't know that. This probably has nothing to do with you. She said so herself. I'm history. Stand by for news. It's next on Channel Five. She'll be back. Hey, Jimmy, you want a drag? Sure. Go fuck yourself. What's wrong, gimp? No bodyguard? Hey, how'd those photos come out? You take any naked ones of that whore friend of yours? Wow, pretty nice. So this is what you use to take all those stupid pictures. You think you're so special with your camera and shit. Well, fuck you. Oh! - Pussy. - Nice shot. We're outta here. Truck Stop. Hey, buddy. How's it going, man? Great. Say, uh... you haven't seen my working girl, have you? No. I been looking all over for her, man. Fuck if I can't find her. Oh, God damn, yeah. We got like a connection, right? Like, kind of like an understanding, right? I mean, shit, man, we know what it feels like to have a fuckin' whore in our lives and then wake up one morning, and, poof, she's just fuckin' gone. That's why. Well, you know what? I'll be God damned that shit's gonna happen again, another whore abandons me. Fuck that shit, right?! Fuck it. Hey, you... you'd tell me if you saw her, right, brother? I mean, you wouldn't lie to old Skid here, would you? Skid, I... I haven't seen her in, like, a week or so. Aw, man. Yeah. You know what? You know what? Even if she doesn't come back, I'm gonna fuckin' find her. Trust me. We'll be okay, right? Mm. Mm? We're gonna be okay. You fuckin' hear that? No. I gotta go, man. Hello. Hello? You shouldn't be outside, Dad. You're too sick. But... nothing hurts today. Here. Oh, no. No, no, I want you to have this. It's yours now. Looks much better on you. You're a cowboy. New horizons. New discoveries ahead. God has given you such an adventure. Uncertainty... is exciting. Remember that. Nothing to be afraid of, okay, cowboy? You know, I'm so... very proud of you. You've become... a man. I love you, Charles. I love you, too, Dad. Kevin... I miss him, too. I wish he was here. I wish he could have seen all the photos I've taken. Can you imagine what he would say if I won? Right, Dad? Well, I thought everybody was nice, didn't you? Stayed too long, but at least they came. Do you have my smokes, hon? Always the gentleman. Thanks. You okay, angel? You haven't said two words. I'm all alone. No, you're not. You got me, and I'd do anything for you. You know that. Jack here, too. I know. It's not that. Well, what is it? What am I gonna do now? What do you mean? You're gonna keep doing the same things you've always done. You're gonna keep working at the truck stop, and you're gonna keep taking those beautiful pictures with that camera of yours. The camera's gone. It's gone? Wh-Where is it? Kids at school trashed it. Oh, sweetie, come here. Oh, sweetie, it's okay. It's gonna be okay. I promise. Now I'd like to announce the winners of this year's Cheeboro High School Photography Contest. The third-place winner with his excellent entry of Beacons of Light is Charles Decker. Congratulations, Charles. Thank you. The second-place winner with Desert Sunsets is Ryan Nelson. There she is. I've been waiting for you. Who you running around with, baby girl? Just some guys down at the truck stop. Yeah? Where's my jack? Can you give me a break, okay? I've been doing some pretty heavy shit, and I... I just need a few hours to... to sleep it off. Please? Okay. But I want my money first. Do you still think that I stole from you? I didn't. I swear. I didn't. Ohh! How do you explain that? It was under your mattress. - That's my cut. - You just ran away from me? - Deserted me? - No. After all the fuckin' shit I did for you, like a typical fuckin' whore? No. I was coming back and doing tricks for you. - Here's your money. - Don't you fuckin' lie to me. I'm not. I am not lying to you. You been wanting to leave me for a motherfucking... Don't, please. Ohh! No. No. No, please! I just want you to be good to me. Okay. I just want you to show me some fuckin' respect and make me some fuckin' money! Do you think you can handle that? Yes! I... Do you think you can fuckin' handle that? Yes, I can do it. Do it, then. That's all I want! Hey, Truck Stop. Hey, my man. Is that you? Oh, God damn it. God damn, is that who you been running around with? No. No. A fucking cripple from the truck stop? No. What? Charles, Charles, Charles, you have to go, please. What are you doing, Truck Stop? Huh? Leave her alone. I told you to stay out of my business. I'm not fuckin' playin' with you anymore. Charles! Whoa! You motherfucker. This is your last chance to get the fuck outta here. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I can't let you get away with that. No. What kind of a man would I be if I let you get away with that, huh? Ah, man, I'll just hit him again. No! Back away from me! Aw, come on. Wake up. Wake up. Come on. Wake up. I'm just gonna teach you a little lesson, right. Just a little lesson, okay? Okay? Don't! Don't. Don't. Hey. Hey, come on. Hey. Hey. Photographs don't lie. In a darkroom, film comes to life... capturing a moment in time. Sometimes someone shows up in your life, and you help each other without even knowing it. In here, I feel balanced. And out there... Hey, can I ask you something? Go for it. You okay? Yeah, I'm cool. I'll see you soon? Yeah, you'll see me soon. You take care. You, too. And keep taking pictures. I will. - See you later. - Bye.
