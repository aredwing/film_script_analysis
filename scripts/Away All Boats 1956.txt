U.S. Marines had clawed their way onto Guadalcanal... and American soldiers were settling in North Africa... before that ship was ready for sea late in 1943. Here's the story of that ship and the men who sailed... to the battered beaches of the Pacific in World War ll. This is the way it was. Dave, are you sure you won't get another night off? No. - I'll write every day. - So will I. Bye, darling. Good-bye. Detail, forward... march! Hup, two, three, four. Column left. March! You sailing on her, Captain? Wrong rank, old-timer. I'm a lieutenant. Wasn't you captain of the Roamer? - Yeah. - Yeah. I thought so. Last time I seen you around San Francisco... was on the bridge of the Roamer when she was in dry dock. You seen them launch this ship months ago. That's right. Launched and towed away for outfitting. I wondered then what she would be. Now you're sailing her off to war, huh? No. Not quite. I'm not the captain of this ship. Why is that? I was a captain in the merchant marine. I gave up two stripes to enter the navy. I... did it because... I know. I wish they'd let me sail on her. I helped build the Belinda. Yep. She's still talking. Don't laugh, boy. She was talking while we built her. She's still talking. Come here. Listen to her. Those sounds-they're just locked-in stresses working out. They're slow in a part-welded hull. I know. I know. Each part is trying to be free again. They'll settle together. She's a good ship... a fortunate ship. She'll go far... and she'll come home again. Mr. MacDougall, our captain is scheduled to finally show up... - at noon tomorrow. -1200. Oh, I'll never get used to navy time. Anyway, his name is Hawks, Captain J.S. Hawks. I saw it on his baggage. - Would you know him, sir? - No. Mr. Fraser says he's seen action in the Atlantic AND Pacific. Won a Navy Cross at Guadalcanal. - Then he's seen more. - Yes, sir. Academy man, naturally. Naturally. Well, good night, Mr. Kruger. Good night. I'm relieved we're getting... another officer who's had a lot of sea experience. I didn't mean me, sir. I mean, BESIDES you. I mean, as captain, sir. Yes, Mr. Kruger. I mean, 0300. Another hour of this. Getting the midwatch is for the birds. Yes, sir. Owls. Yeah. Captain Jebediah S. Hawks... requesting permission to board, sir. Permission granted. Yes, sir. What's your name, mister? - Kruger, sir. Boat group. - Kruger. California will miss you at quarterback next fall, son. Mr. Kruger, all officers not on watch... will assemble in the wardroom in five minutes. Aye, aye, sir. Yes, sir. And the assistant boat group commander-Lieutenant Sherwood. How do you do? He adds some culture to the ship. He was Literature instructor at Yale. Princeton, Commander Quigley. I'm Dr. Flynn, senior surgeon, sir. - Doctor. - Dr. Bell and Dr. Gates. Dr. Bell. Dr. Gates. I'm impressed with the civilian background... of my medical officers. I'm looking forward to catching something requiring treatment. I doubt you'll have much opportunity... to practice your specialty, Dr. Gates. - Obstetrics, wasn't it? - Yes, sir. And your first lieutenant, sir- Mr. Fraser. Considering your experience, I'll have the best... deck department in the fleet. Thank you, Captain. QUIGLEY: And the signal and recognition officer- Ensign Twitchell. I'll do my best for you and your executive officer. Let's hope it'll be good enough. And your boat group commander- Lieutenant MacDougall. I'm gratified you were assigned to my ship. Glad to be aboard, sir. Please sit down, gentlemen. So lacking in dignity. This casual popping aboard at 3:00 in the morning. War or not, we should have some kind of impressive ceremony. Dress blues and all that. Something. CAPTAIN: We have a new ship. With the exception of our chiefs, we also have an almost totally inexperienced crew. When I speak of you as being without experience, I don't mean it as a criticism. It's a situation we're always in... when war is suddenly thrust upon us. Failing to remember the past, we're doomed to repeat it. We have to make the most of what we have... and pray that it's enough. How you as individuals will weather... the months or years that lie ahead is an imponderable, but this ship is not. The Belinda is an attack transport, largest of all amphibious types. An attack transport's main battery... unfortunately is not her guns. It's her boats. The singular duty of this ship... is to carry a combat-loaded battalion landing team... of some 1,400 officers and men... and land them, together with all necessary equipment, right in the laps of the enemy. You will learn how to accomplish this... easily, I hope... or, if you prefer, as painfully as you wish. Commander Quigley. Is the Belinda ready for sea? Um, yes, sir. Very good. The Belinda will get under way for a shakedown cruise at 0630. Destination is Pearl Harbor. Good morning, gentlemen. Carry on. And you, Mr. O'Bannion, are my beachmaster. Yes, sir. I was sleeping, and I wasn't on duty- Mr. O'Bannion, on my ship, every officer's on duty 24 hours a day. Yes, sir. Old shipmate told me about him. He was skipper of a destroyer that sunk... when the Japs tried to take Guadalcanal back. He kept the guns firing till she went under. He didn't get that Navy Cross sitting on his bucket. They got to be griped down snug. VPs weigh over eight tons. We can't have no eight-ton boats banging around loose. Check all securing gripes and tighten them. Hey, what's all the noise? What are you doing? Just making everything shipshape, sir. All done here, sir. Chief. Carry on. See that our part is secure. Aye, aye, sir. What, um... His name's Riley. One of the motor macks. He lives up to the nickname he's already earned, doping off up there. Men call him Sacktime. It's Mr. Jackson's first day at sea. He'd appreciate some help from experienced hands. Come below. But that's supply department business, sir, not your- Well, if you say so, Mr. MacDougall. Mr. O'Bannion! O'BANNION: Yes, sir? Alter your course Aye, aye, sir. Excellent. All right, Chief. You may dismiss them. Shove off. Waxing the deck. Somebody will- Moran, I don't want to hear complaints... - about waxing the mess deck. - Yes, sir. It makes for greater cleanliness. I made a study of feeding crowds of men, a scientific study. Now, you see how scientifically everything is arranged? The men leave seating tables, get drinks here, then move to mess tables, then- Whoa! Oh! Very scientific. What idiot waxed this deck? Hmm. You win, Chief. Never again. Oh, that's all right... sir. Need any help, Mr. Jackson? My storerooms. They- they must be a wreck. And the galley. Galley's shipshape, sir. Smells like we're having... roast pork and sweet potatoes for dinner. Ha ha ha! Clean it up, Chief, and nail down the new gear. I won't tell you how. You know more about this than I do. CAPTAIN: Do you hear there? This is the captain. Before the Belinda was cast off this morning, it was reported that the ship was in all respects... ready for sea. If there now remains any doubt whatsoever... that this report was overoptimistic, I'll be pleased to remain on this course. Teaching them the hard way. That's a very dirty trick to do to anybody. Mmm! Mr. O'Bannion, alter your course Aye, aye, sir. Is sick bay in good health, or is major surgery indicated? Oh, some bottles got smashed. - Smells pretty strong. - I told Doc he should smell... the rest of the ship. Not so antiseptic. I'll bet if you could count them, from that rolling. It's better to have them get it over with now... than later on, when we might need all hands in an emergency. I have a hunch our captain knows his business. Which no one can say for our executive officer. Get this wardroom cleaned up right away. - This is most unappetizing. - Aye, aye, sir. Ah! Coffee. Never-ending supply of hot coffee. Great inducement for any man to enlist. The weather was quite rough for a while. - It was? - Very. It even woke me up. - You were asleep? - Yes. After all, there was nothing to do. Night orders are assigned, sir. Very well. For some time, I'll permit only you, Mr. Randall, Mr. O'Bannion, and Mr. Fraser to stand top watches. You're the only officers whose sea experience... - qualifies you for such duty. - Yes, sir. I'm aware of the sacrifice you made... in rank and salary when you entered the navy, but I'd suggest you try to forget that you were... captain and master of a ship in the merchant marine. Adjust to the fact that I'm captain of the Belinda. I'll be in my sea cabin. Porthole will be open. You can talk to me anytime. I'll be awake. Target plane approaching. This run is for port-side guns only. Repeat-port-side guns only. This is a five-eight! Get onto the target! Get on! Now hear this. This is the captain speaking. You are to get down on your knees... and give thanks that that was only... a 30-foot piece of canvas instead of an enemy bomber. I've seen 10-year-old kids shoot better with slingshots. CAPTAIN: Well, at least they look like sailors. Belinda is the smartest-looking ship... to enter and leave Pearl in many a month. A smart-looking ship's a credit to itself and the navy. War is no excuse for aping the appearance... of a river coal barge. Gangway's clear. Handlers are ready to cast off. Very good. What is that? MacDougall, bring that man up here. Aye, aye, sir. Stand by, all lines. - Sailor? - Yes, sir? The captain wants you on the bridge. Say, that's right nice of him. I never been up there before. Follow me. Back 1/3! Back 1/3, sir. Ease your rudder to standard. Ease your rudder to standard. Hey, fellas! Look at me up here in officers' country! Oh, hi. - Mr. MacDougall, take the con. - Aye, aye, sir. What is your name and your division? I'm Gilbert Hubert from Tennessee. Um, Tennessee, yes. But what division on the Belinda? What are your duties? Oh, uh, first division. I'm the garbage grinder. That's one of the importantest places... on the whole ship, you know? I grind up the garbage and mix it with water. It runs into the ocean and mixes with it... so no Jap submarine finds us, like they can if them mess cooks dump it overboard. You see? I see. But you-you should keep cleaner. Oh, I keep that place clean, Captain. Want to come to the garbage grinding room and see? I dare you to find a speck of dirt. The only trouble is the chicken guts. - Chicken guts? - Yeah. They jam up them gears. Them and them mess cooks leaving forks in the garbage. - Why, just this morning- - Commander Quigley. - Sir? - See that this man gets... - cleaned up and into uniform. - Yes, sir. Nice place you got up here. Visit me anytime you feel like it. I'll show you around. Oh. Well, I'll see you. Chicken guts. Port boats will proceed aft and circle counterclockwise. The starboard boats will circle clockwise, like so. This pattern is to avoid boats colliding head-on. They'll just glance off one another. If all our coxswains can remember left from right. Take the hand you want them to remember and dip it in paint. Let's get on with it. Then the boats will be called alongside by number. Right! Right! Right! Right rudder, you idiot! They look like lady drivers on dollar day. Ha ha! - Take it easy! - Move on! Hey! It took some doing, but we got our boats away. Yes. You got them away in exactly one hour and 43 minutes. What are you waiting around for, MacDougall? A "well done"? They're all here, sir. Rehearsals from now on will be with troops. Please do not drown them. They are needed for future commitments to battle. Second division, stand by to receive boats... along starboard side. Boat 19 to White Three. Boat 11 to Red One. All boats away in 35 minutes, Captain. That's the best time yet. It's not good enough. OK. Roger and out. - Another boat broach to, sir. - What? Oh, when are those coxswains ever going to learn? Hey! Hold it! These boats are made of plywood. You'll smash them into kindling! They're no good on a beach. Get this bulldozer out of here! I don't take orders from you! I take my orders from Sergeant Kelly! - What's going on here? - This idiot's wrecking my boats! You don't need to force marine cooperation on the navy! - Sergeant Kelly says- - This is the navy beachmaster... you're arguing with! He's in charge of everything up to the high-water mark! Now, get your bulldozer out of here! And as for you, O'Bannion, either keep your shirt on... so my men will know you're an officer... or tattoo your rank on your chest! Command boat! - What's the matter? - Lost our rudder! Back her down. O'BANNION: Mr. MacDougall! Get on the beach, sailor! Corpsman! Get a corpsman! Get Doc Bell! Hello, Captain. MacDougall. I'm delighted you've chosen to remain here... rather than let our doctor ship you to some shore hospital. - I'll be fine here, sir. - I'm sure. I wish I could be sure of other matters. You've been a skipper. You understand. I'm without any help on the bridge. Quigley is-well, he's exec in name only. With few exceptions, we're officered by men... who spent three weeks fitting their uniforms... and one hour reading the manual. Suppose something happens to me, as it has you. What happens to the Belinda? They'll learn, sir. Of course, but the enemy won't wait. MacDougall, I'm glad you had this accident. Now I can use you to the benefit of the ship. I don't understand, sir. What's your opinion of Steve Sherwood? Do you consider him capable? I couldn't get along without him. He's a natural leader, natural in the boats. Excellent. I'm making Sherwood boat group commander. You'll then have time to train new officers... and keep an eye out for me. But I'll be well by the time- Oh, be practical, man. It'll be months before you can climb. It'll be weeks before you can walk again. I don't want to lose command of my boats. We all want things our own way. I wanted command of a cruiser instead of this... The Belinda will get me that cruiser... by being the top APA in the fleet. I need a real sailor on the bridge with me. That's where you come in, mister. For your information, we're all through with dry runs. Next time, we hoist our boats in enemy waters. Away all boats. Away all boats. Away. Now hear this. Man your debark stations. Boat 22 to White Three. Amtrak's in line of departure. Boat 17 to Green Five. Boat 17 to Blue Six. Boat 10, bear a hand. Getting alongside at Yellow Eight. Boat 11 to Red Two. Amtrak's on beach, sir. All right, Willie. Let's take Makin! all boats. It's better time than I'd hoped for our first combat. I will not tolerate complacency. We have to stow the tank ladders on number five hatch. They'll always be the controlling factors- CAPTAIN: I am the controlling factor aboard the Belinda. My ship will set speed records every time she goes into action. The Belinda will be the most efficient APA... in the Pacific fleet. Is that clear, Mr. MacDougall? MacDOUGALL: Yes, sir. Get this man back to the Belinda. Flagship calling, sir. Answer him. Queen Bee, this is Tango. Go ahead. Tango, this is Queen Bee. You are forward of your area. Put ship back on station immediately. Repeat: you are forward of your area. Put ship back on station immediately. Over. Queen Bee, this is Tango. Wilco. Out. Put the ship back on station. Wait 20 minutes, then crowd our area. I want to reduce the time for the boats to the beach. Sir? I don't believe that's Boski, sir. I can read his flags like a book. Have him repeat. I can't tell if he's sending a Howard or Baker. TWITCHELL: Boski! Come up here! Forget the flags. Use a searchlight. Get going. He's itching to put somebody on report this morning. Yes, sir? Where were you going? Why didn't you report to me? Why are you aboard? I come after some batteries for the beach transmitter. That's a job for a radio man! You were to stay to receive my signals. You deserted your post! Exactly why did you come aboard? Mr. Twitchell, sir... Mr. O'Bannion ordered me to get them batteries. Mr. O'Bannion commands the beach party. I'm in the beach party and do what he tells me to do, sir. But I'm the signal officer! I'm the signal officer! TWITCHELL: Boski! You come back here. How dare you walk away from me like that? Why did you do it? Answer me! Mr. Twitchell, sir... if I stayed here when you talk to me like that, I'd have to clobber you. To keep from doing it, I left. TWITCHELL: I'm an officer. I'm your superior officer! You disregarded me. You order me to stay, and I'll stay as long as you tell me to. Sir. So, what's left of these two platoons of infantry... are cut off about here... near the tip of Wo Chi Island. If not rescued by dawn, they'll be wiped out by the Japanese. The chart shows this reef between the lagoon and island... but the captain thinks there's a passage somewhere... wide enough for a P-boat. Our job is to find it and rescue the troops. Now who'll volunteer? It's a very simple job, gentlemen. If it's so simple, why don't you go? Why, I- Gentlemen, the army needs a hand. Thank you very much, gentlemen. I'll inform the captain. I'll get a flag and wave it. That's not funny. I don't think it's funny, those guys being trapped. It's Quigley-I wanted to belt him the first time I saw him. MacDOUGALL: He's trying. Give him a break. That teacup admiral's had nothing but good breaks. It's time he found out it takes more than... a toothpaste-ad smile to pull his weight with men. Mr. Kruger, you're elected. You'll take four boats and rendezvous with... a flagship P-boat for instructions. You'll find it somewhere this side of the reef. - Good luck. - Thank you, sir. QUIGLEY: The captain said to take orders... from the senior officer regardless of service. - Yes, sir. - I'll fix you some sandwiches. Fine. No use dying on an empty stomach. - Good luck, Kruger. - Jim. - Good luck. - Good luck, Kruger. - Good luck. - Good luck, Kruger. MacDOUGALL: Commander. Why wouldn't the captain let me go? QUIGLEY: He didn't say. I'd like to speak to him. Go right ahead. Tell you something. I'd like to go myself, but I can't. I need you, so you can't. I'll tell you something else- Commander Quigley also wanted to go. He volunteered immediately. Yes, Mr. MacDougall, our executive officer may well be... growing into his stripes. May I join you in a cup of coffee, Commander? I'd like that very much, Mr. MacDougall. Major Scott, there's a reef between us and that island, and these boats will get hung up on it. Come daylight, they'll be sitting ducks for the Japs. You're the navy. I can't order you in. But somewhere on that beach are some guys that need help. About where can we find your people, Major Scott? - You'll try for them? - That's why we're here. Are you crazy, Kruger? I told you there's no passage through that reef. My skipper thinks there is, sir. OK if I come? I'm to take orders from the senior officer present. That's you, isn't it? - That's me, mister. - Climb aboard. You Belinda people. You're all wise guys. I got a Silver Star at Attu that says you won't make it. Lieutenant, notify my regimental headquarters that we'll try. Yes, sir. Stay close together in column, keep me in sight, and keep blacked out. Pass the word. Take it slow along the reef. Eddie, lower the ramp. What's the plan? Find a hole in the reef. Come ahead. Come ahead! Hold it. Solid coral. Back off. Over this way. Back off, Willie. Easy. Easy. Hold it! Hold it! Maybe he's right. Maybe there isn't any way in. Maybe. I found it! Come ahead, Willie. Hold your fire. Don't get trigger-happy. Annie, this is Lulubelle. That you, Blanchard? Yeah. Are you Major Scott? Right. Man, you don't know. We were cut clean off. Runners never got back. Japs everywhere. It wasn't so bad when they charged- Sure, sure. Let's go now. Get your men in the boats, huh? Anchors Aweigh will be my hymn from now on. Come on, fellows. Into the boats. Let's go. On the double. All you'll have to remember this by will be your Purple Heart. You've been hurt worse in football games. Yeah, I sure have. You know, I wanted to be a football player. My feet couldn't take those shoes. Always felt like the cleats were on the inside. Yeah, I know what you mean. That's funny. I didn't want to play football. I wanted to be a doctor. It's the truth. Hot flash in high school, so when I got to college, everybody pressured me into going out for the team. There aren't enough hours to play football... and study medicine at the same time. Guess not. I've been thinking, though. When this war is over, I'm going back to Cal... and this time, no football. See, Doc? You're a bad influence. - Congratulations, Mr. Kruger. - Thank you, sir. You're all a credit to the Belinda. Ship's company, dismissed! Yes, sir? You're the recognition officer. Are those Japs or friendlies? What's the captain waiting for? Why don't he let us open fire? They must be Japs, sir. Commander Quigley! - Sir? - Identify those planes. QUIGLEY: Friendly. - Huh? - Hellcats, Captain. Cease fire. Cease fire immediately! Planes fired on are friendly. I say again, friendly. Mr. Twitchell, go study your recognition manual. You're on hack until you've drawn 25 freehand silhouettes... of F-6Fs. While you're doing it, remember you advised me to shoot down Americans. No gunnery discipline at all on those ships. Almost started an epidemic. Boat from the Sandival's out to pick up that flier. He doesn't seem hurt. I don't envy the crew that picks him up. He's going to be the maddest pilot in the United States Navy. Six more men on report-all for fighting amongst themselves. Sit down. Thank you, sir. If this keeps up, we'll have the whole crew on report. Yes, I know. Since the men found out the routing changed from Noumea... to Guadalcanal, they've been... well, sir, they were disappointed. So was I. Sir, I checked with island command. We can have their athletic field from 1:00 to 4:00 tomorrow. The chaplain's stirring up interest in a baseball game. Mr. Jackson found out anything about our mail yet? He's checking on it. Beer and Coke? The chaplain wants to have some for the younger men. I'm surprised we have any younger men... after what they've been through. So ordered, Commander. Liberty for all hands on Guadalcanal tomorrow. QUIGLEY: Yes, sir. Liberty on Guadalcanal. That's like getting to New York and spending your leave... in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. CHIEF: And I thought we was going to New Caledonia. To Noumea. The navy figures we're too young to be exposed to French dames. I like to visit historical places. Don't you ever wash? CHIEF: This garbage grinder's ready for salt water. You don't understand. I wash. Quit pushing! All right. Knock it off! Knock it off. Captain... Sir? All of our mail is at Noumea. We haven't had mail for weeks, and my wife's having a baby. Believe me, the men are riled up about it. - The baby? - No, sir- no, sir. I mean the mail, sir. I know what you mean, Mr. Jackson. Send a signal to the fleet post office. Request that the mail be forwarded to our next anchorage. Yes, sir. Plans for the next operation have arrived, sir. Liberty on Guadalcanal. Fine lot of combat efficiency that'll build into my crew. Sir? CAPTAIN: Nothing. Nothing. Let's look at those operational plans. Yech. If this was Aussie brew, I'd be feeling it. Nah. In good Australia, where they got good beer and pretty women. In New Caledonia, where they got pretty French women. Warm 3.2. No dames, no mail, no nothing. Nothing! Nothing but sailing on the lousy Pacific on a lousy ship... with a bunch of creeps like Sacktime Riley! RILEY: Huh? What's the matter? Bad enough doping off aboard ship. Don't do it here. RILEY: What's eating you? If it wasn't so warm, I'd work you over. You, too, if you weren't such a runt. Don't let that stop you. Look at them. You'd think it was the World Series. Strike one! - Strike two! - Strike? Strike?! Chaplain, are you blind? That last ball almost took my head off. Strike two, O'Bannion. O'BANNION: If that was a strike, I'll eat it. CHAPLAIN: If you don't stop arguing... every time you're at bat, I'll toss you out of the game. One more word and out you go. Now play ball. Well, that's a Protestant for you. - That's my coconut. - Your coconut? It's mine. - I said it's my coconut. Get one of your own! Hey, a fight, guys! Let's go! Attention, men! Attention, I tell you! This is an officer speak- Mr. Twitchell, sir, I'm really- TWITCHELL: You're under arrest for striking an officer. - Ah, shut up. - Get away from me. - What did you say? - Get off my foot! Ow. TWITCHELL: What are you doing? I saw you do that! You got it all wrong. CHIEF: Riley? Riley! MacDOUGALL: Break it up. Break it up! Mr. MacDougall. Mr. MacDougall. What's going on here? TWITCHELL: You saw it. You're a witness. He hit me! He struck an officer. He was in on it, too. MacDOUGALL: All right. Knock it off! Did anybody see what happened here? I saw the whole thing, sir. TWITCHELL: How could you? You were busy catching. While I was taking off my mask, I looked up and saw these two white hats. They were wrestling over a coconut. All in fun, sir. Mr. Twitchell evidently thought they were fighting. When he stepped between them, he tumbled over a coconut... and fell and hit his head on... that tree. No-nobody punched him. Nobody laid a hand on him, sir. It's all a pack of lies! I'll get witnesses. You'll all pay for this. I'll put everybody on report for this! You'll see. You'll see. All right. Break it up. Back to your game. Any noticeable good effects from our afternoon on the beach? Mostly bruises, as far as I can see. Mr. Twitchell's report about his mouse... would indicate a riot took place. I've been able to secure a replacement for Twitchell. Cut orders relieving him from duty... and send him ashore for further assignment. QUIGLEY: Yes, sir. - You wanted to see me, Captain? - Oh, yes, Torgeson. Come on. Sit down. Commander, I want him off the ship tonight. - Tonight, sir? But- - Aye, aye, sir. CAPTAIN: Sit down. - Coffee? - Sure. Two coffees. My compliments on procuring that fine hardwood... from the navy sawmen ashore. How much did you get? I mean, 10 feet... What, sir? CAPTAIN: I asked how much hardwood did you get? Oh. That's almost enough... to repair every landing craft in the division. Well, sir, a little extra always comes in handy... for trading purposes. It ain't, uh-no. It ain't as though there wasn't plenty of it. Island's lousy with it, sir. Look here. Nice little boat, huh? Sure is. Could you build a boat like that? Yes, sir. If I had plans, I could. CAPTAIN: There's a description and all specifications. Could you build it from those? - Yes, sir, I could. - Good. Do so. Huh? CAPTAIN: Take that along and start building my sailboat. You mean tonight, sir? Right now, aboard ship, sir? If you're capable of building it... and repairing our landing craft at the same time. You've ample materials. I want it completed at the earliest possible date. Use all the men you need to accomplish it. Understand? Yes, sir. Oh, thank you, sir. - Oh, your coffee. - Oh, no, thank you, sir. Hey! You finish making the hinges for the ramp on boat nine? I only got two hands, Mr. Kruger. This lousy jewelry for the captain's crummy sailboat... takes priority over everything. You'd think it was some kind of new secret weapon! Will you try to make the hinges, too? Yes, sir. Know what I'd like to do with these cruddy cleats? Mount them in the seat of the captain's pants. Here we go again. You're in charge of the deck department. Aren't boat repairs your responsibility? Yes. So? What are we making the landings with- our VPs or the captain's sloop? - Quit beefing to me about it. - You got twice as many people... working on that sailboat as on our landing craft. You think it's my idea? Dave, you're close to the old man. What do you make of this? I don't understand. I know he can be stubborn, but up to now, he's always been for the ship! His ship is looking another D-day right in the eye, and only half of his boats are ready for it! That's the last. Absolutely the last red ink I can find. - What are you doing? - Dyeing canvas. What does it look like we're doing, you stupid- Oh, hello, Chief. And why are you doing it? The captain wants red sails on his sailboat. That's why. Go on up. I want to show you something. Feast your eyes on that. Beautiful lines, eh? - I call her the Albatross. - She's a real beauty, sir. CAPTAIN: She'll make a dandy for me to sail... when we're in some snug anchorage. Meantime, we'll keep her stowed in the Mike boat. She's ready to launch. Right, Mr. Fraser? I hope our VPs will be as ready to launch. CAPTAIN: They will be. I knew my crew would- I assumed you, of all the officers aboard, would most understand my motives... for having this sailboat constructed. I was mistaken, Mr. Fraser. What's that supposed to mean? You're no veteran. You've just put in time in this navy. - Look, MacDougall! - You look! You're closer to the crew than other officers, yet you're blind to what's happened to them. The men were coming unglued from too many months at sea. They'd lost their combat efficiency. They needed something to fix their hate on... so they'd stop fighting among themselves. The captain gave it to them- himself and this sailboat. You worried about the boats being ready. They'll be ready, mister, but more important, the crew will be ready. You don't get those stripes for nothing, do you? I'll bet every navy ship is anchored at the Admiralties. That PA over there, number 22... she's really been places. Holy cats! A sailboat? Ready about! Let's take her home. See that Admiral? He's about to bust with envy. Not a skipper here that ain't jealous of the Albatross. He knows how to sail. He can sail a shingle in a hurricane. Well, she didn't sink. She sails pretty well. Thank you, sir. Spare a hand and be gentle when hoisting her aboard. See that she's wiped dry. Be sure to polish her brass. May we take her aboard at hatch number five, sir? Affirmative. Bring her alongside Green Nine. She's a pretty sight scudding before the wind. Looks like she handles fine. I want a boat alongside in 10 minutes. Commander Quigley and I are going to an operations meeting. - Aye, aye, sir. - Oh, Captain! Sir, I've been waiting to tell you. It's in Highlandia now. Our mail, sir. Didn't you instruct the post office to forward everything... and leave it in the Admiralties for pickup? Yes, sir, I did, but they showed me the top-secret list... which tells where every ship is. That list shows the Belinda anchored off Highlandia. They sent our mail by air to be sure we'd get it-22 bags. Perhaps they'll fly it back. She could have it now. I don't know. Why are we always anchoring in the wrong place? I'll see what I can do. Watch the mooring line, sir. Captain! Get the lantern. We sewed him up and took him to his cabin. He's sedated. He'll sleep for a while now. Thank you. How serious is it? No skull fracture, but there's undoubtedly a concussion. Just how serious, we can't be sure. Not for some time, at least. But knowing him, I'll bet he'll skipper his ship all the way to Leyte. Now hear this. Stream your paravanes. Stream your paravanes. - Stream what? - Paravanes, whatever they are. What's that thing for? It's supposed to deflect mines. Cuts them loose, they float to the surface, and we detonate them with rifles. We're sailing through a mine field now? Oh, my aching back! We've passed control point x- ray, Captain. We're now 34 miles south of Tacloban. How's our timing? Three minutes ahead of schedule, but the ebb tide and currents are stronger than predicted. Tides and currents were always here. The mines weren't. Mine found in starboard paravane! Chief Torgeson reports mine found in starboard paravane. - Right full rudder! - Right full rudder, sir. Reports-continue reports! Inform the flagship and ships astern. Alert the engine room and Damage Control. Mine found in starboard paravane. Engine Room, Damage Control, mine found in starboard paravane! All damage control parties, stand by with shore firefighting equipment. All troops will move immediately to starboard side of midships. Clear the starboard side. Can't carry on any further. We'll run into the next column. Chief Torgeson reports he still can't see the mines. We can't lie here. We're being set down on it faster every minute. Back the ship. Aye, aye, sir. All backs pull! What's the captain doing? That mine will hit his midships! Standing by. Captain wants Alvick on the bridge. - Now right full rudder! - Right full rudder. Radar range to the columns on either side. - Alvick. - Yes, sir? You're the best rifle shot. Get on the forecastle and prove it. I could prove it quicker with a 20-millimeter. It could get ricocheted into some ship and start a shootout. - Take off. - Aye, aye, sir. - All stop! - All stop, sir. - MacDougall. - Yes, sir? Can you her like this for five minutes? Yes, sir. I can hold her. Let me know when Alvick gets there. Forecastle, the captain wants to know when Alvick arrives. - I can see it! - Ready in the forecastle. - Open fire. - Open fire! Got to hit a horn. Plugging it full of holes won't do any good. Basketful to unknown ship... violating gunfire restriction plan. Cease fire immediately. Out. Who's Basketful? Commander of first LST squadron, sir. 57.7.1. Stu Masterson, class of '26. He's junior to me. Basketful, this is Tango. Stick around, Stu. You ain't seen nothing yet. - He's hit it twice. - One of the horns? Couldn't tell. Maybe it's a dud. So you're the big rabbit hunter from Wyoming? If you ain't better at shooting rabbits... than you are at that mine, when you get home, you'll starve-if you get home. Knock it off up there! Good shooting, Alvick! That's some dud. Put the Belinda back on course. Distance to the guide, MacDougall. Aye, aye, sir. Commander, troops can resume moving to their debark stations. Aye, aye, sir. That concussion should have slowed him down, but he's sharp as a needle. Sure is. MacDOUGALL: Troops, resume movement to debark stations. All troops resume movement to debark stations. Stu Masterson. Always goes by the book. It's all he knows. It's all he knows. Captain's back from the beach. Stand by to hoist Peter boat 10 aboard. The kamikazes got another escort carrier this morning. Mm-hmm. Japanese keep this up, and I'm transferring to the infantry. - Hey, Dave. - Yeah? I hear the captain brought a female aboard from Tacloban. - Is that true? - Yep. A Red Cross girl? Nurse, maybe? - A monkey? - And a female, too. This is Chip-Chi, friend of the captain's, going to share his cabin from now on. - Ow! - Got all its shots? Are you going to get typhus? - I got to see this. - Yeah, me, too. Let's go. Let's go, hon. What's the captain doing... turning the ship into a zoo? Chip-Chi will provide companionship for the captain... make the brutal loneliness of command a little more bearable. The loneliness? Are you kidding? His own pantry, his own stewards, doing what he likes when he likes... I could stand a lot of that kind of loneliness. Because you've never had it. Command's one of the loneliest jobs in the world. Eating alone most of the time, living from the bridge to the chart room... to an empty cabin. He wouldn't be lonesome if he were more sociable. He can't be sociable- not aboard his own ship. No captain can. If he becomes too friendly, he may rely on friendship... instead of his own judgment. At that moment, he's no longer a good captain. Give me a warning when he turns the con over to the monkey. I want time to jump overboard. Hey, fellows, here comes the mail! Hey! Hey, let's go! Mail! I've got it! I found it! Here it is! Mail! What's the picture tonight? Same as last night, sir. In this one, she's six months pregnant. Here she writes the doctor said she might have twins. Here she's waiting for her ride to the hospital. This last one is from her mother. It says "Alice and children are doing fine. " Children-how many? What are they, boys or girls? Holy mackerel. - Phew! - Phew! - Move over. - Stinkeroo. Too hippy. Hippy? She's built like a battleship. I must have seen it at least six times. I guess I'll skip it tonight. Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me, MacDougall. NADINE, VOICE-OVER: Darling, this has been... such a special day for me. I want to share it with you. It began with my getting six wonderful letters from you. I read each one a dozen times... and then pasted them in the scrapbook. When Robby grows up, he'll have them all... the eyewitness report of the war his father fought... in the Pacific. I don't know what thing set me to dreaming... your picture, I guess. I got to wondering if you remember the same things I do... about our life together... like the first time I saw you and the first time you saw me. You were being lectured by Mr. Kurland about something but stared at me so hard, I typed the same line over again four times. Remember how fussed I got? Then you asked me for a date, and I said yes, but you didn't even try to kiss me good night. I kept wishing you would... so I could prove how ladylike I was by refusing. I want to thank you for going out with me tonight. I enjoyed the dinner and show very much, Captain. I wish you'd stop calling me Captain. My name is David, or Dave, if you like. Um... maybe we could go out again tomorrow night. Well, if you want to. I do. Uh... same time? OK. Good night, Nadine. Good night, Dave. NADINE, VOICE-OVER: I wanted to be kissed so bad, but you didn't even try. And you, a sailor, to boot. In a way, I was glad, though. It proved you respected me... at least until our second date. Oh, Dave. D-D-Dave. Dave. Dave. Dave. Dave, stop now. Stop. Stop it. Dave! - Oh, honey, please. - Dave. Dave. No, honey, not here, please. Please, not out here. Inside, huh? No. No, not inside, either. Stop, Dave. Dave. Dave... hmm... NADINE, VOICE-OVER: And finally I realized... I wasn't just another girl in another port when you proposed. It was at the beach, and you were so serious. And I loved you so much. Ahh. Honey, you got to think about it... not just emotionally, but mentally. It's not easy to be a sailor's wife. Well, it's not easy to be a wife, period. I love you. I want to marry you. I want you to know what you're getting into. I know. Do you? Look, I may be away for weeks at a time. Oh, but those homecomings! But I'll think about it if you want me to. NADINE, VOICE-OVER: I'd done my thinking months before, so we married the next day. You were away for weeks at a time, but, oh, those homecomings! - That's all of him, huh? - Every square inch. Well, he's nice. Nice?! He's beautiful! He looks a little like Winston Churchill. All new babies look like Winston Churchill. - Really? - Yeah. NADINE, VOICE-OVER: Each time you came home from a voyage, you'd bring gifts like no wife in the world ever got. That Sunday when you'd come back from your trip to the Orient, I'll never forget that. My hair's too short, and my eyes aren't Japanese at all. You look beautiful in it, dear. Even Robby approves, see? RADIO ANNOUNCER: We interrupt this program for a news flash. Pearl Harbor has been bombed and strafed... by Japanese carrier planes. The fleet has suffered heavy casualties. The number of American soldiers and sailors... killed in this sneak attack is still unknown, but it's feared to be very high. Stand by, please, for further reports. NADINE, VOICE-OVER: Now I spend my sunsets... looking out at the vast Pacific. Every evening, I stand on the cliff below our home... and try to send my love across the water to you. Does that sound silly? I don't care. You're out there somewhere, and I like to believe... that you can feel the love reaching from me to you. So please be careful, my darling... and never forget... you have two people who adore you to come home to. All my love... Nadine. Now toes out. Turn around. All right, now face me, heels together. Really hurt, huh? All the time, Doc. I soaked them in salt water like you said, rubbed them good, and wore heavy socks. They still hurt something awful. Flattest feet I ever saw. You recommended sending Gilbert Hubert, Seaman Second Class, to Naval Hospital Guam, where the services of a chiropodist are available. That's right, Captain. We can't help him here. How long would he be away? Oh, about two weeks, sir. That's too long. We'll be on our way before he'd get back to the ship. Is it a critical condition? No, but his feet really require expert attention, sir. He needs special shoes. I believe you, Dr. Flynn, but he'll have to wait. Hubert is not military, and he's not sanitary, but he's important to the ship's safety. Hubert's the only man aboard who likes to grind garbage. He's the only man who can be trusted to grind it properly. Request denied. His feet will sweat out the next beachhead... before I part with him. Very good, sir. Congratulations, Commander. "You'll proceed immediately to Pearl Harbor, assume command of the APA Peacock. " My own command. You've earned it. What's more important, you're ready for it. Captain, I... Have the yeoman cut orders... turning over executive officer duties to MacDougall... and assign Randall as navigator. Aye, aye, sir. I'll miss the Belinda... and you, sir. I... well, I kind of grew up on this ship, serving under you. I made a mistake about him. He turned out all right. I managed a couple of mistakes aboard this ship. Nobody makes mistakes on my ship... not serious ones. This next one is it. We're going right into the Japs' backyard and taking it. Yes, sir. Only trouble is, they know we're coming. They must, Captain. In Tacloban yesterday, a Filipino boy selling mangoes... asked me if I was going to Okinawa with everybody else. There's no such thing as a real secret. I'll tell you one. They tried twice to take you away from me... and give you your own command. I blocked it each time. You're entitled to your own ship. You should have had one from the beginning. I couldn't let you go. I thought no man was indispensable in this navy. No man is. I kept you because you were important to the Belinda. You're stubborn, you're proud, and a lot of the time, I hate your guts, but you really love the ship. - What's that got to do with it? - Everything. Old beachhead Belinda is... more than just another APA to you and me. To you? You tried to use her to earn your command of a cruiser. I remember you calling her names and hating her. That's right. I did. Funny. Quigley moved on to his own command. I could have requested and gotten a cruiser. Just never occurred to me. But you kept me from getting my own ship? I gave you my reasons why. Since we're speaking frankly, sir, your reasons stink! I have other reasons. I'm getting tired. There are times when I... Maybe I should have taken more leave after Guadalcanal... or after that fouled-up mess in North Africa. A man can take just so much, I guess. I keep getting those headaches. They nearly blind me. I'll recommend you for your own command... after this next operation is over. For now, you must stick by the Belinda and me. I've always tried to do my duty, sir. I love this sailboat, too. Weird sort of a day, eh, Pappy? Yeah. This whole week at Okinawa's been weird, Padre, just like dry runs- no shooting from the shore, no kamikazes. It just ain't natural. Will you stop watching clouds and watch what you're doing? I was listening to Tokyo Rose after supper. She says they got their suicide planes all lined up, ready to sink every ship we got. Propaganda, Pappy. She's just trying to scare us. You know something? She's doing it, too. I ordered the transports to sea for tonight. Could be a busy one. Cruisers and destroyers on the picket line... are holding off the kamikazes, but some are bound to break through. Bogies, bearing 055, 20 miles, closing. Flash, flash! Take necessary deployment action and evasive maneuvers. Out. She'll be over our screen any minute. Watch for firing out there. - Mr. Randall. - Yes, sir? Don't let the lookouts get excited and get out of sector. What is it, MacDougall? We haven't unloaded wounded from the Latimore LCM. - Get aft. Hurry them up. - Aye, aye, sir. - I'll help. - Give me a hand mike. - Yes, sir. Now hear this. This is the captain speaking. In a couple minutes, you'll get the chance of your lives to do some shooting. A swarm of kamikazes is coming in, hellbent on getting the transports. They're not going to get old beachhead Belinda, if you keep your heads and carry out my orders. Now, listen, men, all you have to do... is obey orders and do as you were trained to do. Loaders, load. Do not look around the sky. Pointers, point. Trainers, train. Do it easy, like a dry run, and do it fast. Use your heads, your experience, and your training. That is all. Carry on and good hunting. Pat, get these people under cover fast. No use jerking their arms and legs off. They got it tough enough. Get those men out of that LCM now! We got to get moving! Many kamikazes, Dave? More than we've ever seen before, Padre. Get that hatch covered on the double. All right, dopes, get those hatch covers on... as soon as you can. Engine's ready to answer bells, sir. Standard speed's set-15 knots. Count at least 20 of them. Raid Three closing rapidly on transport area. No cap in vicinity. Out. LCM clear, Captain. - Ahead 1/3! - Ahead 1/3, sir! - Right full rudder! - Right full rudder, sir! - Take the con. - Aye, aye, sir. Keep in contact with me by headphones. I'm going up to control... and knock down some of those divine wind boys... before they have time to commit suicide. Whew! Boy, that was close. Let it down! Turn around and then back in, Chaplain. Hurry it up, Padre! Aah! Back to your stations! Dave. I was operating when it happened. Come here. I don't know how many of the wounded on deck got hit. At least a dozen, maybe more inside the sick bay... and that man on that table. What about Doc Flynn and the padre? Both of them. Mike O'Bannion, too. And the fire's almost out. After starboard deckhouse demolished. Watertight integrity in all but number five hatch. Casualties. killed by crash, plus two more who died of burns. Seven of our own crew killed, including Dr. Flynn, Chaplain Hughes, and Mike O'Bannion. - Is that all, MacDougall? - No, sir. The Albatross, Captain- she was completely demolished and burned... and Chip-Chi was killed. RADIO: Flash red! Control yellow! Five strong raids closing the transport area... from all sides. Now inside the cap and closing. Out. - Control! Did you hear that? - Yes, sir. I may join you in Control, but I intend to remain here... and con the ship at high speed. Keep the guns concentrating on planes closing! Never mind the wolf packs out on the rim! Here they come, Captain! - Flank standard rudder! - Flank standard rudder, sir! - Full ahead flank! - Full ahead flank, sir! Right full rudder! Over there! Over there! Damage Control reports we're hit at the water line, sir! Stop engines! - Stop engines! - Stop engines, sir! They'll really bear down on us now. Don't let the gun crews be distracted by the fire. Leave that to Fraser and Damage Control... until we beat off this attack. Keep watching here. I'll take the starboard side. Aye, aye, sir. Mustn't let them get to us again. She can't take any more! Hard left. Hard left, I say! Hard left, sir! CAPTAIN: Get away from my ship! Get your filthy plane away from my ship! Captain! Give me a hand here. Help me get him down to his cabin. Easy. Aah! - Get one of the doctors. - Aye, aye, sir. Doctor will be here soon, sir. I've got to get to the bridge. I'll rest my eyes a bit. The porthole will be open. You can speak to me at any time. I'll be awake. Captain. You've seen that hole in our side? We're going to sink for sure! No. No, I won't let her sink. - I left him in his cabin. - He's not there. Pete Ryan just reported the captain's in number 4 hold. He thinks the doctor better get down there. Jim, can you take the con? I think so, Dave, sure. Stay on this course. It will take us to the Kerama-retto. That's an island group If we get her there, we've got a chance to save her. I'm going below to survey damage. Toot on the whistle if the kamikazes show up again. Right, Dave. Dr. Bell's waiting for him in surgery, sir. Nobody can work down there! Kind of silly trying to fight fire here... when we're going to drown any minute. That fracture goes at least We had it shored up twice. The water pressure's too strong. With the smoke, the men can't stay down there for a third try. Are the pumps working? Yeah, but at the rate we're flooding, it's like trying to bail her out with a tin cup. Might as well face it, sir. We're sinking. About the only thing left to try is an air bubble. Huh? Cover the hatch with canvas. Tar it down. We pump air under it so the pressure... will force the water back out through the fracture... or at least keep us floating. - Let's do it. - We can't, sir! The forward air compressor's busted. We haven't got enough air hose... to reach from the other one. It's in the aft boat repair shop. Yeah, that's the rub. Let's move that compressor down here. You crazy, Pappy? Weighs more than a ton. Cargo booms for this hold are busted. Since you're not going to manhandle it down here- If you could get it to the hatch, have we got enough hose to reach? Just about, but moving that compressor- It can't be done, sir. We won't know unless we try. Come on, about 8 of you guys! With me! Get me more CO2. This one's about empty. fell through a hole, burned the overhead. You fool, you can't go back in there. That ammo will blast you to bits! This is my garbage room. They ain't going to burn my garbage grinder. She works! By golly, she still works. Listen to that! Kamikazes. Where are they? No kamikazes, Dave. Chief Torgeson reported... number four hold has cracked open more. He thinks she's breaking her back. - I thought you'd want to know. - She can't sink. Can't let her sink. Doc Bell's seen Hawks. The captain's still alive, but that's about all he can say for him. Read the clinometer. If she'd shifted back, nothing could have kept her from capsizing. I'm going to Damage Control to check with Fraser. Then I'm going below for another look at that hold. - We got to keep this list. - You're telling me! If we don't... she'll roll like a log. I can't pump out any more double bottoms. She'll capsize for sure. I don't think we'll be able to save her anyway. Even if we build up an air bubble? How can we get that brute of a compressor... moved from the fantail to the number four hatch... in time to do it? In the meantime, I got a small problem... with water flooding the shaft alley. I'll meet you in number four hold. Rations stored in the life rafts? Together, you jugheads, together! You can't move nothing one at a time! I tell you, it would be better- You ain't telling me nothing! I'm telling you! Grab hold! Put your guts in it- all your guts! One, two, heave! One, two, heave! One, two, heave! One, two, heave! Come on, now! She's starting to go! Get with it! Let's have it! One, two, heave! One, two, heave! There she goes again, sir. Couple of them frames let go, we'll sink like a rock. It couldn't be a frame. Shell plating makes a terrific noise when it snaps. It's probably just the skin of the ship. I got to find out how hurt she is. He swimming around down there? He could be washed out to sea through that hole. Shut up. Starboard side's OK. If she was going to crack apart, there would be signs of it there. Now to see what the plane did to us. There's still a bulldozer... and a couple of trucks down there. He could get caught under them and drown. I'm all right. Just leave me alone for a second. She's cracked all the way down. Our only chance is with the compressor. All right, now, walk her around! Walk her around! Grab her! Hold it! Steady! That's got it. All right, guys, tie her down. Bear a hand with that job there? We're ready to start building the air bubble in this bucket! What took you so long, Pappy? Get the rest of those hatch covers down. Stand by with the canvas and tar. Bring up the rest of that shoring timber! All right, bear a hand! All right, turn her loose! How are you feeling, Pappy? Oh, I'm fine, Mr. MacDougall. Come on. Better let the doctors check you. They got enough to do with the wounded. I'll be all right, sir. I ain't near as ruptured as the ship. We should make the Kerama-retto in a few hours, sir. Once we reach there, we can pump her out, patch her with cement, and signal for a tow to a repair dock. If any kamikazes should jump us there, we'll at least have a chance to beach her. Is he hearing anything of what I'm saying? I doubt it. Randall, what is it? Engine room has just reported... the propeller shaft has snapped. Broke off at the main bearing. Oh. I'll be right there. Propeller shaft's gone. That's done it. CAPTAIN: Children... children... children help the mother. Children can help. I just talked to Fraser. He's in the engine room. Nothing can be done. Want me to start moving the wounded out... so we can get them into the life rafts... and whatever boats we got left? Children helping the mother. That's what he meant. Now hear this. This is MacDougall speaking. Our propeller shaft is broken. The ship is without power. At this moment we're a helpless, drifting hulk, but we're afloat, and we can still save our ship. We'll hoist out what boats we have left... and tow the Belinda to safety. All deck divisions, break out mooring lines for towing. Boat crews, man your boats! Probably burn out the engines in every boat, but it's all we can do. You know how long it took to hoist out the boats? only 11 minutes! It's not remarkable, Mr. Randall- not for Captain Jeb Hawks' crew. Good evening, Captain. I wonder if you would please lie down... so I can check you over. Where is Dr. Flynn? He'll prescribe for me. I don't mean to question your ability, sir, but Dr. Flynn is my doctor. Dr. Flynn was killed, sir. Flynn killed? Flynn dead? He was... Please, Captain. Sir, I'd... like to have a look at my ship. CAPTAIN: At anchorage? That's the... Kerama-retto, isn't it, Mr. MacDougall? Yes, Captain. We're just moving into it. Kerama-retto... Okinawa... Saipan, Guadalcanal. What's the difference? If a man has to die in a war, it doesn't matter where. MacDougall. Yes, Captain? Watch out for old beachhead Belinda. She's your command. I guess he couldn't die until he knew his ship was safe. He started saving her the morning he came aboard. All of us are better than we ever thought we could be... because of what he gave us... and we'll go home again... because of him.
