Watch it. Sorry. Excuse me. Coming through. Oh! I am not brave enough to be your Queen, but the heart tells me I must. I am afraid to claim my throne! But I am not afraid to reveal my affections for you. Well, one of you. Be with me, Princess, and my chiseled chin, not Edweird. No, Princess, forget Alucard, be with me and my dazzling dimples. Oh! Her Majesty and Alucard will make such a regal couple. Try dusting your eyes. Edweird is the clear choice for her. Look at Edweird. Oh! Love the dimples. Naw, I love Alucard's chin. If they could only see that there is more to me than beauty and royal destiny, but alas, I have a secret. I am not the ghoul you think I am. Vampire scaritage requires you to reveal all of your secrets before your coronation as Queen. Oh, my ghoul! Totes fake! Vampire royalty has no such rule! Hey, sit down! Trying to watch a moo-vie here. Yeah, you're blocking my view of Veronica Von Vamp! She's hot! This is the best boovie ever. And Veronica Von Vamp as the Queen? Fangtastic! Please. She is a disgrace to vampire scaritage. Hauntlywood got it all wrong! Well, sorry! But I know how this really works, I was there! Did you know vampires haven't had a proper Queen for over 400 years? But this is totally fake! Quiet! I'm watching a movie! Thanks for talking the whole time. Make way. It's her Royal Fakeness! Draculaura, you owe me a movie. Sorry if I got carried away, but that Veronica, she just frosts my fangs. You better get used to her. The Vampire Majesty boovies are the most popular ever made. Popular does not mean good. Well, I loved it. And her. But the real story is so much more fangtastic. I should know, I did grow up in Transylvania. At the Vampire Royal Court. We don't usually talk about it. I had to leave in a hurry. How is it that there hasn't been a Vampire Queen for 400 years? Yeah! Tell us all the voltageous details. Especially the romantic parts! Well, after the last Queen's reign ended, the search began for the next ghoul in line. I love this! They used an ancient jewel, the Vampire's Heart, that was supposed to magically lead the way to the future Queen. The search has gone on for 400 years, but they haven't found her. - So the Queen could be anybody? - And anywhere? Yep. Now wouldn't that make a much better boovie? I'll say... Youch! Hoodude! Sorry, Heath, I still can't control my voodoo powers. Maybe you're secretly the Queen, Draculaura! Wow! That would be cool. That would be clawsome! Whoa, Clawd Wolf, dating royalty. Allow me, Your Royal Highness. Would you prefer the diamond or gold crown, My Queen? Come on, Frankie, I think I'd know if I was really Queen. But I choose diamonds. They go with everything. Hear ye, hear ye! Make way for Queen Draculaura! - See you later. - Okay. Bye-bye! Text ya. Please, you the Queen? You don't even have your vampire powers yet. I never said... You think that you're all bat, but what have you ever done? You two better watch your fangs! Don't fret, love. It's what you think of you that's important. Do you want me to unleash a plague on them? Because I have a new amulet I've been dying to try out. Thanks, ghouls, but I can fight my own battles. You'll be Queen when trolls fly. They're right, I have never done anything important. That's why I don't have all my vampire powers yet. What do you mean? Gory got hers a couple of hundred years ago by saving a Vampire Lord from a sunburn. SPF, like 1,000. I haven't done anything even close to that. I may never get my powers. Draculaura, you have something amazing in you. I feel it, in here. You are going to surprise everyone! I hope. Thanks, Robecca. Master, the Royal Court of Vampire Dignitaries seeks audience with you at once. Very well. Huh? What seems to be the problem? Lord Stoker, we demand to know how the search for the Queen is going! You've had 400 years! Where is she? We think you're enjoying your temporary role as our leader much too much! I assure you I have everything under control. The search for the Queen... Is taking too long! We need a true leader! Vampires are forgetting their scaritage! We just heard that Vampire Prep, our most prestigious vampire academy, is on the verge of closing! The Vampire Court has voted. If you do not find a new Queen by the end of the week, you will be fired! Well, you're in luck because I already found the Queen! - Really? - Really? Yes! I used the Vampire's Heart and, just today, I found her. Isn't that right, Ygor? No, no, you lost the Vampire's Heart when... Ygor means, yes, Master. Ooh, ooh, ooh! Yes! In fact, her coronation is next week! Queen! Queen! Queen! Good. We meet the Queen next week, Stoker. Or it's daylight for you. Next week? Ygor, have you lost your mind? No, Ygor still keeps it in this little jar. How are you going to find a Queen in a week? The Vampire's Heart was stolen by your niece 400 years ago when she... I don't want to find the Queen! Right! Because... Remind Ygor why again, Master. Because once we have a Queen, I will no longer be in charge. Ah! Yes. I am the only one who knows what's good for vampires! What I need is a fake Queen, one I can control and bend to my will. Yes, Master! There! She's perfect! The daughter of Dracula, with all his enlightened ideas about monster equality. I remember her from court. She was always so naive, insecure, and feeble, I imagine she doesn't even have her vampire powers yet. You won't have the courage to question me, isn't that right, my new Queen? Yes. Okay, Daddy. Yes, I know to floss my fangs! I'll call you in six months. Okay. Smooches! Love you! Six months? Yeah, business trip, Antarctica, six months day, six months night, you know. Oh, make way, it's her Royal Fakeness. All hail Queen Draculaura! Class! Class! Settle down, class. Today we'll be continuing our discussion of history. This is your scaritage! The journey to the Boo World. Londoom was a stopping point for immigrating monsters. They left their homelands for many reasons. Probably because they were an embarrassment to their kind. Or 'cause they made up stories about being Queen. Stop torturing me! Draculaura! Don't spook until you are spook-en to. Detention! Could this day get any worse? Attention, Draculaura, report to the Headmistress's office immediately! Hashtag, "In trouble, again. " I am so, so sorry I yelled in class, Headmistress Bloodgood, I... Draculaura, you are... ...the next Vampire Queen! Me? But I'm... You are the chosen one! Lord Stoker! What are you doing here? I was led to you by the Vampire's Heart! Oh! See how it glows in your presence! I really am the next Queen! All hail Her New Vampiric Majesty! Headmistress Bloodgood, Gory has been picking on Draculaura all day... All hail the Queen. Thank you. Hearing that never gets old. Um, they mean me. I'm the next Vampire Queen. - Wow. - Amazing! Draculaura's the Queen? No way! Uh... I mean, uh, no way I won't be the first one to say congrats! Have I told you how much I love that outfit, Your Majesty? We must leave for Transylvania, immediately. Wait, no, I can't be Queen, it would mean leaving all of my friends, and Monster High is my home. What if I never come back? Draculaura, listen to me. Yes, being Queen is difficult for one of your limited abilities. But you are important. Don't worry, I will take care of all the messy details. The Heart chose you for a reason. It is for the good of your people. I'm important? I've always said you were! Can my ghoulfriends come? Oh! I've always wanted to see Transylvania! Of course! The Queen needs her ladies-in-waiting to attend her at the coronation, which is next week, so let's hurry it up, ah? Please, please, can they come, Headmistress Bloodgood? Please! It would be dead-ucational. Well, I suppose it would be a good chance to learn about your monster scaritage in person. Okay! Fangulous! Yay! Transylvania, here I come! All right, yeah! Woo-hoo! Sorry, Gory, you'll be at the Vampire Court when trolls fly. I should have seen that coming. Hate to be a bummer, Draculaura, but Ghoulia, Frankie and I have a major claw-culus project due next week. We're totes happy for you. Wait, I have to tell Clawd! Tell me what? Whoa. Am I in trouble? Did I bury something I wasn't supposed to? Hey, sweetie, remember how we joked about me being the Vampire Queen? Right, that was hilarious. You're not laughing. Yeah, well, turns out, I kinda, sorta am the next Vampire Queen. And I have to leave for Transylvania. Like, now. Wait! So, I guess that means we're... We'll be... Yes. We'll be apart for seven days! That's like a month in wolf time! Who will take me on walks? Oh, Clawd! Oh, you'll be fine. You're a good boy. Who ruvs you? Who does? I do! Now, fetch! Come, we must leave at once! Your throne awaits! - Voltageous! - Clawsome! Yeah! What's happening with Draculaura? Draculaura is the Queen? Wow! Ooh! Fancy! - So long! - Goodbye! Goodbye, everyone. I'll see you at my coronation. Come on, ghoul! Your throne is waiting! Goodbye, Draculaura! Good luck! Goodbye, Draculaura! Monster High will miss you! I'll miss you! Your tomato juice, Your Majesty! Bow to the Queen! Thank you. Ghoul, get up! You don't have to do that. It's tradition. As my dad always says, "Traditions can change. " And as Master says, "Traditions must never change, "and that traitor Dracula's ideas are... " Enjoy your juice. So, tell us more about what it was like to grow up in the Vampire Court! All that history. Sixteen hundred years of aristocracy is nothing to brag about. Egyptian royalty has shoe sales that last longer than that. Oh! The Vampire Court was totes amazing! The beautiful dresses! The grand balls! I used to sneak downstairs with my best friend, Elissabat, Lord Stoker's niece, to watch the Vampire Waltz. We all had so much fun. Well, except for that old crankypants, Stoker. Yeah! Looks like he hasn't smiled in 400 years. Stoker wanted control over all other types of monsters. The whole court was divided. My father, Hexiciah Steam, arrived in Transylvania then, just before the great split, when the more, open-minded monsters emigrated to the Boo World. Stoker and my dad did not get along. You see, my dad's very best fiend was Lord Stoker's younger brother. So what happened to him? Did he head off on a mysterious expedition and no one has heard from him since or something like that? Yeah. Exactly like that! Wow, good guess. I feel like I know this story. Well, his only daughter, Elissabat, was put under her Uncle Stoker's authority. There was a big argument between Stoker and my dad about her future. Poor Elissabat, she wanted to be an actor, but Stoker put his foot down. He said that she had to stay at the court as a vampire-in-waiting. So your dad helped her? He tried. But then, she disappeared just before we fled Transylvania. We are now entering Transylvania. Next stop, Castle Dracool! Ouch! Ow! Whoa! Glamorous Vampire Court, here I come! Whoa! Ouch! Ouch! Behold, Castle Dracool! - Magnificent! - O-M-Ghoul! Well, it's no pyramid. It looks just like the one in the Vampire Majesty boovies. Ygor's not allowed to see boovies. A vulgar waste of time. Bleh! I haven't been here in forevs! Such memories! Come on, ghouls, I'll show you around. Whoa! Oof. Ah! - Ooh! - Whoa! Ah! Yay! Hoo hoo! I forgot how wonderful this castle is. So dark and dreary! I love it! Grand, I say! Nice, as far as castles go. Lord Stoker has sent Ygor to bring the new Queen to his study to hear the rules. Well, duty calls. - Later! - Good luck! Queen problems, am I right, ladies? Wait in here, My Queen. Do not touch anything. Master gets very grumpy. Ah! Ouch! The Vampire's Heart! Huh? What are you doing? You ever heard of knocking? So rude. What are you doing with that? You didn't find anything else, did you? I just touched the Heart, but it didn't light up. Vampire scaritage says it always glows when the true Queen touches it. What gives? No need to worry your pretty little head. I just have to change the batteries and it... Uh-Oh. Batteries? Oh, my ghoul! It's a fake! Wait, then that means I'm not Queen? Oh! The people need to be told! I command you! Stop! What the people need is a Queen. And you are just the ghoul for the job. Why me? Why not try to find the real Queen? Because you will do as I say! I will remain in charge, of course, and in return you will live a life of luxury as the Queen. Not a bad deal. This isn't right. Dear, Draculaura, aren't you tired of monsters like, what was her name, that Gory picking on you? Don't you want to matter? To go down in history as a famous, important vampire? Don't you want to finally get your vampire powers? Well, yes, I do, but... Good! Then you shall serve as my puppet. All you have to do is jump when I pull the strings. What do you want me to do? Your first order of business will be to stop the intermingling of vampires and other monsters. You and I will turn back the clock to a time when vampires ruled the world! There will be strict rules to ensure that we return to our former glory, as the most respected and feared monsters in the land. Do we have an agreement, My Queen? I don't think you have a choice. And that's reason 104 pyramids are superior to castles. Reason 105... Draculaura? What's wrong? Nothing, except I'm not the real Queen! But the Vampire's Heart? At Monster High, when you touched it, it glowed. You're the Queen. Lord Stoker faked it. The real one is gone. And Stoker chose me to be the Queen because I'm just a nobody, who will do whatever he says. You still get all these clothes though, right? I mean, being a fake Queen is still better than not being royal at all. Never thought I'd say this, but Cleo has a point, the vampires have been without a Queen for a long time. - You'd still be helping. - No! He wants me to make vampires rule over all other monsters! We won't be allowed to be friends with anyone but vampires! That's horrible! Wait, if you're not the Queen, then who is? Only the Vampire's Heart knows, and it's been missing for... Wait! Maybe this is how I can help! How I can finally do something important to make a difference to my people! If I find the Heart, I find the Queen! And she can put a stop to Stoker! Yes! Right on, ghoul! As long as you get to keep some shoes! Oh, though, how am I going to do that? I have a strong feeling that there are clues here, in the castle, but where? Stoker's study. He went batty when he thought I going through his stuff. I'll distract him while you sneak in and search it. Great idea! Time to kick some bat! Hello, Stokey. It's Lord Stoker, My Queen. Have you made your decision? I have. I will be your "Queen. " It's too good to pass up. Excellent. I think this will work out well. Yes! I was hoping to go over some questions about the whole being Queen part thing. Uh! Ask if you must, but make it quick, you have an appointment with important vamp-bassadors. Oh, this won't take, uh, too long. Okay, just look, should I wave with my left or right arm? It does not matter. Okay, okay, then I'll do right, how does that look? Now, do you want me to wave from the elbow or wrist? Because I was thinking I could do a fun combination of jazz hands... Wave however you please! We have no time for this, I must present a Queen to the vamp-bassadors, let us go. Okay, I guess I don't have to be that convincing of a Queen for the vamp-bassadors. Wouldn't want it to seem fake. I suppose a little more preparation could not hurt. Oh! Great! This will be fangtastic! Okay, let's pick out a coronation outfit. I like pink, it's my favorite color. What's yours? Okay, how do we sneak in? That Ygor guy's not exactly the roundest gizmo in the gear, but he's not leaving that door. There has to be a secret passage, but where? Ghoul-sundheit. Hey, hey. ghouls! Hoodude? Did ya miss me? Whoa! I'm good! I'm good! What are you doing here? I stowed away. I just couldn't wait a whole week to see all the royalty. So you've been hiding in the armor this whole time? Oh, no, I've been everywhere. This place is loaded with secret passages. See? Oh! Here we are! Lord Grumpypants' study. Elissabat. Stoker's niece! You sure they're related? I mean, that ghoul is actually smiling! Draculaura's father. Whoa! Let me see! Whoa! Oh! Wow! Neato! "Dear Count Dracula, as my father's beast friend, "I beseech you. I have discovered "that I am the next heir in line "to be the Vampire Queen. "If my uncle finds out, he will use me to control all vampires "to ensure our supremacy over other monsters. "I do not want to be a puppet. "But he is too strong. " "I am too young and weak to stand up to him, so I must flee. "Since the Vampire's Heart is the only way to find me, I must take it. "I can only trust you, Count Dracula, "to be its new guardian until another Queen arises. "Meet me in the Fog of Doom, where the Globe meets the Tower, "and I will leave another note for you in the crown. "Elissabat. " Wow! A major clue! But I don't get it. "Fog of Doom"? Here, Londoom! But I don't see anything about a crown. Scooch over, ghoul, crowns are my department. It's obvious she's talking about the Crown Jewels in the Tower of Londoom. Come on, let's show this to Draculaura! Um... Girls' bathroom. BRB, Lord Stoker. Make it quick! What did you find? Who the real Queen is! Elissabat! My old friend? No! Yes! And we know where she went! Londoom! My older sister, Clawdia, is studying dramatic writing there! She knows Londoom like the back of her paw! Enough of this! The vamp-bassadors await. Ygor, fetch the Queen! My Queen, Ygor is to take you to the vamp-bassadors. Just a sec! Ah ha! Hoodude? Hi, Draculaura! Come on! Uh... How do we get out of here? Below the castle there's dock with a boat. We can sneak out to Londoom on that! You are coming with Ygor! Uh-oh. Master will be angry. Where is the Queen, Stoker? We are waiting. The monarchy must be restored! Stoker, you didn't lie to us did you? Because you can be replaced! Uh, just a moment. What? The Queen has had a makeup malfunction. Please, wait here. He he. Ta-da! - One escape boat. - Ugh! It'll take us a century to get to Londoom in that old thing! How about a steam ship? Cool! All aboard the SS Robecca! Let's go! It's not first class, but it'll do. Hang on, everyone! Our very own royal vampire adventure! Oh, I'm just like Veronica Von Vamp! Except, I'm a boy and not a vampire. And no one's fighting over me... Can't you make this thing go any faster? Whoa! Only four days until the coronation! I hope I get to meet a vampire prince like Alucard from the boovie. Oh! He is monstrously hot! Hot? So not. The cute one is Prince Edweird, duh. Hey! What are they arguing about? I can't even tell those dudes apart. And here's a picture of Elissabat. Thanks for the web search, Ghoulia. In the meantime, we're on the way to Londoom! Laters! - Cheerio. - Good. Draculaura isn't Queen, which is bad for her, but she gets to come back to Monster High, which is good for us. I don't know how to feel about this. I don't think so, Ghoulia. It's better if people don't know Draculaura's looking for the Vampire's Heart or Elissabat. Uh uh uh. Y'all know I don't like secrets. Unless I'm in on 'em. Whatcha got? Londoom! Now we just have to find... Veronica! Ugh! I can't seem get away from her! Ooh! They're making a sequel to Vampire Majesty! We're on a quest for real vampire royalty. Yeah, not some Hauntlywood phony who doesn't know a thing about vampire scaritage. Robecca, come on. Oh, sorry, coming! My sis said she would meet us here. At the Globe Theatre. Cool statue! This must be the first ventriloquist act ever! That's no dummy. That's William Spooks-Fear. He was the most famous playwright ever. For 400 years he's been inspiring actors, directors and writers, like me. Clawdia! Hey big sis! Thanks for helping! Sure! We wolves are known for our loyalty. Come on, you're just in time for the tour. But, Master, they could be anywhere! Ah! Not anywhere, Londoom. Follow her and bring her back! If that ghoul flaps her fangs about the Vampire's Heart... ...my reign of power will be over! Yes, Master! Here it is, the crown. Uh! Not impressed. I mean, where are the scarabs? Hmm. I don't see any clues. We're gonna need to take a closer look. I have an idea, but it's tricky. Cleo, you keep watch while Clawdia tells the guards she has a thorn in her paw. Then Robecca will let out a burst of steam to cover. And what do I do? Hoodude, you just wear the crown? Oh! Oi! That bloke is stealing the Crown Jewels! Get him! - Hoodude! - Ah! There's no clue in this crown! Huh? Oh, no! Oh, here you go! Sorry, guys. He thought it was a souvenir. I told you the gift shop is downstairs. Silly boy! This doesn't spin right. I could feel that we were on the right track. What exactly was the clue? "Where the Globe meets the Tower, "I will leave another note for you in the crown. " Oh! Elissabat's not talking about the Crown Jewels. She means that crown. Back at the Globe Theatre. Oh! A crown can also mean the top of the head. Or, more relevantly, a skull. I think I like the regular kind of crowns better. I can't explain this, but I feel like I've been here before. Wow! It's a map, and another note! Yay! "Count Dracula... " "It is too dangerous here. "I'm taking the Heart and fleeing to the Boo World. "Here is the map to my destination. " New Goreleans! My father took me there when I was just a little ghoul. And that's where my father lived when I was under construction. She must have taken the Heart there. We have to go find it! Next stop, New Goreleans! And I'm going with you. Really? That'd be totes appreciated. Mom and Dad would shed their fur if I didn't keep an eye on you ghouls. Besides, this will make a great story someday and I'm gonna write it! Yeah! That's how you do it! Whatevs, flea bag! Edweird is cuter! As if, litter lover. You can't see the obvious awesomeness of Alucard? It's right in front of your face. Duh, yeah! Totally. See? Everybloody likes Alucard. Sorry, I'm on Team Edweird. There's just something special there that Alucard doesn't have. I don't even know which one you're talking about. How 'bout you, Twyla? Who do you like? Come on, looks don't make the monster. I can't just crush on a shadow I've only seen on the silver scream. I mean, it's what's in his heart that counts. You can't judge a bat by its wings, right? Okay, officially, ignoring you now. Anyway, Edweird, purr-fect! Yeah. He's purr-fect. He's gorgeous. Na-uh! Alucard all the way. He's way better. Oh! The cutest. No one else thinks they look alike? Hooray! I can't wait to get to New Goreleans! - Wow! Look at that. - Fancy Now these monsters know how to party! Ah! Master, they've arrived in New Goreleans. If they locate the Vampire's Heart, then they can find the rightful Queen. We cannot let that happen. You know what to do. Yes, Master, I won't let you down. Oops! Ygor? Ygor! Sorry, Master. There's nothing here. Maybe this old map is out of date or something. No. The answer is here, I can feel it. I think somebody needs to have their gears checked. Wow! Ghost ship! Awesome, right? Yay! What is this place? Gorgeous. Oh, my Ra. I've read about this ship. It was a floating theater called the Bijou on the Bayou. Check out all the old props and scripts. Oh, yay! You know, every place Elissabat tried to meet with my Dad had to do with a theater. Uh... Ghouls, I think you should look at this. We don't have any time to watch your dance... What is it? Sweet suffering swamp moss! Hey, y'all are in my shot. Who are you? I'm Honey Swamp. Pleased to make y'all's acquaintance. What are you doing here? I'm making my student film about the famous Bijou on the Bayou theater. We're looking for an ancient, valuable artifact. Do you think it might be on the Bijou? Well, so many great actors, writers and directors have toured through. Ya know, the boovie star Veronica Von Vamp gave her first performance here! Ain't she a peach? Oh, yes. No, not a fan. Oh, no! We can't go back without the Heart! Ygor good! Ygor bring the ghouls to you, Master. Excellent, Ygor. Don't worry, ghouls. I got friends in low places. Come on. Y'all go first. I wanna catch this on film! Low angle, track the action and... Cut! Ygor, you brainless lunk! Stop them! Yes, Master. Huh? I'm sorry about the Bijou on the Bayou. It ain't nothing to worry about, y'all. It's a ghost ship. It'll rise up again on the next full moon. So we have to wait a whole month to find out if the Vampire's Heart was even on the ship? Didn't anyone see anything remotely resembling a clue? Whoa! Hold on there! Let's rewind. I took some amazing shots of the Bijou on the Bayou. Let's check the footage! There! That wax seal, it's Elissabat's! "Lord Dracula, as long as I have the Vampire's Heart... " "Its glow will lead others to me. "I cannot wait any longer, so I am steaming onwards. "I have found someone we both trust, "an eternal friend, "and given to their care... " "... the Vampire's Heart. " Oh! The Heart could be anywhere. This is a wild ghost chase. I can't stop Lord Stoker. So much for helping vampire-kind. Wait a minute. In literature, everything has a reason, a purpose. Nothing is coincidence. If I were writing this, I would use a literary device. Foreshadowing or symbolism perhaps. Or what about just putting it on a poster? Well, not super subtle, but I guess if it served the story... No. There, on the poster! Veronica Von Vamp! Oh! The Vampire's Heart! In the boovie? My wheels are clicking. Elissabat must have given the Heart to Veronica. They were both here in New Goreleans at the same time. Whoa, whoa! Confused here. Why would my dad trust that vamp-poseur, Veronica? One way to find out. I do believe Honey Swamp and I are thinking the same thing. Uh-huh. Time to take this story to - Hauntlywood! - Hauntlywood! - Hauntlywood! - Let's go, ghouls! Wow! They're off to Hauntlywood! This is so exciting! I wonder if they will see any boovie stars. Like... - Alucard! - Edweird! - Alucard! - Edweird! Alucard! Edweird! Ghoulia right, this "which boy is cuter" argument is totes cray-cray. We better do something or it's the Ghostfields and McFangs all over again! Don't they seem the same to you guys? Nyeh. Can't tell them apart. Couple of dudes. How dare you compare Alucard to Edweird? He looks like he has bat breath! Those are fighting words! Now that I got your attention, I gotta say, this has gone too far. Yeah, cool it! Now back in Gnarlston, we solve our differences by having a good old-fashioned trial. We settle this in Cute Court. Hauntlywood, get ready to meet Monster High! Come on! Let's find that star that leads to the Queen of the silver scream! And action! Fun, fun, fun Hauntlywood, here we come Let's have some fun Fun, fun, fun Hauntlywood, here we come Where my Ghouls at? Hey, hey, hey Black carpet, moonlight So excited screams come true tonight Frights so bright and cameras flashin' Here we come Frights, camera, action Fun, fun, fun Hauntlywood, here we come Here we come Hello. We're looking for Veronica Von Vamp. Name. We just told you. Veronica Von... No, ya big pin cushion, your name. On. Hoodude Voodoo. Nope, not on the list. Thanks for stoppin' by. Buh-bye. I got this. Name? No! You give me your name because I am Cleo de Nile! That's de Nile as in the de Niles. And one call to my father and I'll have you transferred to the night shift in Fright-beria for the next 100 years if you don't open that gate this instant! Uh, um... Yes, ma'am, I mean... Miss de Nile! Right away! Here you go. I am impressed. Yeah, being a diva is like Cleo's super power. Okay, ghouls, it's a big lot. Let's try to find Veronica fast before... Anybody realizes we don't belong here. Yeah, that. Hauntlywood? Why would the Heart be in that den of mediocrity? No decent vampire would dare take it to such a place. I heard the Vampire Majesty boovies are clawsome! I would really like to see my first boovie if you... I will fly out immediately. Then we will bring Draculaura back to be my puppet Queen, and I shall remain in charge forever! I have her now. O-M-Ghoul! Is that? Yes! The famous die-rector, Scareantino! Hey! Watch out! Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh! Mr. Scareantino! I wasn't looking. Nice going, Viperine! Gear me, I... I am fading to black. Let me wind that for you. Opening shot! Zombies to the left! Zombies to the right! Cue the music! Enter the hero! But who? Hmm. Gotta dig up some old star and resurrect their career! Note to self, pack a shovel. Ninjas! Why didn't I think of that? Put it in the movie! Oh no. No, no, no! I can't be late again. I'll get fired from the boovie for sure! Looks like you could use a hand. And a paw or two. I got your scare-spray right here. Thank you so much! I am Viperine. I owe you guys, big time! All rise. The honorable Judge Twyla is presiding. Cute Court is now in session. Each side will now make a case for their hunk. Your Honor, Alucard's adorable face and great smile makes him clearly the cuter monster. If you want purr-fect face, you just have to look at Edweird. Pale skin, blue eyes. Objection! The boovie is black and white, you don't know the color! And you wouldn't know cute if it bit you on the neck! Alucard is the cute one! Edweird is hideous! Order! Order! I still say they look the same. Can't tell the dudes apart. Yeah. Dudes. Whoa! Oof! Okay, I'm good! I'm good! Oops, missed! Hey, could you throw that in with the other typewriters? In creative frustration? Sure. Sorry about that. Just going through a little writer's block. It can't be! That's Scary Stone, the most amazing scream-writer in Hauntlywood! Ms. Stone, if you have writer's block, my friend Clawdia is a writer. She can help. This new werewolf movie? It is chewing me up. You've changed the "Wwwwwwooooa!" to "Aoooooowwww!" So authentic, so raw, so wolfy! It's brilliant! You have got to help me with the rest of the script! Wow! It's always been my scream to be a writer in Hauntlywood. See you later! Write lots of words! Oh, goodbye guys, I hope you find the... Whoa! - Have fun! - Oh, do have fun! Okay. Bye, bye. Where is camera two? My underwater camera? Really, made of stone? That's your excuse! Oh, come on, I can't make this without underwater footage! Excuse me, I think I know who can help. Go on! This is your scream! Yup! There's nobody better if you're talking about a camera and a swamp! Why I can rack a focus while changing lenses on a backtracked Steadicam. Whoa. What does that even mean? All right, I'll try you out. You go, ghoul! She's going to be great. And action! And cut! I love it, I love it! I'm looking for a triple threat! Where we gonna find someone with the pure raw talent to handle this part? You wanna triple threat? Here I am. I sing! I dance! Jazz hands! And I act. Skulla! You got the job! Hooray! - Hoodude, even your scream came true! - Awesome! In Hauntlywood, triple threat means dust, mop, sweep. Oh, well, at least I'm in showbiz! Ha cha cha! Let me get this straight, you say dimples are better than a chiseled chin? No, chiseled chin! No, dimples are better! Ghoulia, what does science say about dimples versus chiseled chins? Wait, are you telling us that they are the same actor! Digitally composites! to seem like two different boys? No way. What an unexpected development. Twice as delicious. Order in the court! Order in the court! In the case of Alucard versus Edweird, I find that you can't judge a bat by its wings! Case closed! Cute Court is hereby adjourned! Totally called it! Yep, same dude. I knew it! And they called me crazy! Oh, they actually did, you know. Okay, I guess dimples are cute. And I could see getting used to a chiseled chin. What is it, Ghoulia? Couldn't be, could it? We're close, ghouls, I can feel it. This way. Wow. Huh? Veronica Von Vamp. We have to get into that trailer! Oh! That'll be easy, except for those two huge bodyguards. "Looks like you could use a hand. " Viperine? You work on this boovie? Yeah. Thanks to you, I didn't get fired. Can you help us meet Veronica? Leave it to me. Viperine, plus makeup crew. How come so many of you? We have to make Miss Von Vamp very, very, very, very, very, pretty for her next scene! Uh, yes, ma'am. She's not here. Well, then I guess we wait. A trailer this classy shouldn't be wasted. No! I can't rest until we find her. Do I know you? The Vampire's Heart! It's here! Sorry, you're looking at a fake, this is Hauntlywood. It's only a prop. We're very sorry for intruding like this, but... Well, I can always sign an autograph for a fan. Uh, sorry, not actually a fan. In fact, I think that your stereotypical portrayal... Not the time! Now, you tell me, why are you looking for it? Because the Heart will lead us to Elissabat, the rightful Queen of the vampires. Wow, I haven't heard that name in a long time. The vampires need a Queen. Quickly. And Lord Stoker chose me, but then I found out that his Vampire's Heart was a fake, so I decided to find the real one so it could lead me to the real Queen, who is, in reality, Elissabat! So, I need help. What if she doesn't want to be the Queen? Everything we stand for will be undone if Stoker rules. The vampires need her. All monsters need her. If Elissabat were here, she would probably say that she's just one ghoul, nothing special, and maybe she doesn't think she has what's needed to be Queen. I get that. It takes courage, heart. And I know she has it. Listen, not all of us were meant to do great things. She should be proud that she was born to do something so amazing. Look, I want to help, really, I do. But I promised Elissabat that I would keep her secret. Then, you can you tell her, from Draculaura, and this is big, that she ran away once, but I will find her, that I will never give up. Why? This is how I can help. How I can do something big. Something important! And when she's Queen, she can help everybloody. This is a turning point in vampire history, and her duty calls, to help monsters everywhere! Ready on the set, Miss Von Vamp. I must go. Please, Miss Von Vamp, if you know where Elissabat is, you have to tell her. Elissabat disappeared a long time ago. I want to help, but... Fur-rific. The Heart's a fake, and Veronica's not gonna help us. What are we gonna do now? I'm sorry, it seemed like you were so close. Yes. Elissabat is close. I can sense it. Then we keep looking. Come on! I've got you, Your Highness. No! My Queen is found at last. Is this in the script? Now, this is how it will be. You will return to Transylvania. You will take your place at the court. And you will obey me. I love the gritty realism! Keep rolling! No! I am so close to finding Elissabat! Ha! She is gone, and you will be Queen whether you want to or... I think not! I insist. And what gives you the authority? I am the Prime Monister of all the vampires. And I am Veronica Von Vamp, boovie star. And you are in my studio. I protest! I have never been treated like this. Well, then, it is long overdue. Draculaura, your people need you. No! They need the true Queen. Monsters everywhere are counting on her. I am counting on her. You won't be able to boss her around! No way! Well, hard to say. She's not here! You will not use that tone on my set. Guards! Veronica, if you know where Elissabat is, please, please, help. You know where... Draculaura is right. It is time. The vampires need their real Queen, Elissabat. Ghoulia? Yeah! Veronica is talking about Elissabat! Veronica is... What? Say again? I remember Elissabat, who, more than anything, wanted to act. Only on stage, and in her imagination, did she have the strength to lead. But my friend Draculaura has reminded me that you need to have courage to face your fear, to overcome it, to help others. I did? Yes, this is a turning point in monster history. Did she tell ya? No, no what? It is time to raise the curtain on a new act. Veronica Von Vamp is, and always was... That's right. I am... Elissabat? The Queen of the vampires! I knew she was close! Yup. She fooled us. Just goes to show... You can't judge a bat by its wings. That's right! Robecca, take my hand. Oh. Whoa! Amazing. - Oh! - Bleh! I gave the Vampire's Heart to your father, Hexiciah Steam, to keep safe. So he put it in the safest place of all. It led you ghouls to me. Lord Stoker, for your crimes against the vampire crown, you are banished from ever holding official office. Boys, show him the street. But I'm the boss of everything. Ygor! Master! Hooray! Tonight is my new boovie premiere, it will also be my coronation. And you are all invited. And cut! That's a wrap! Off to the edit bay! This is Spectra Vondergeist, blogging to you live from the famous Hauntlywood Groaning's theater for the premiere of Veronica Von Vamp's new boovie. I am being told via telepath that the star of the boovie, Veronica Von Vamp, is arriving now. With her is Draculaura. What an entrance. Whoa! Ooh! Oh, Miss Von Vamp, may I have your autograph? I'm so flattered. Would you honor me by being my date? Huzza! Draculaura! She's here! Draculaura! Clawd? Draculaura! Oh, Clawd, I missed you so much! Do you like that? Good boy! You missed your ear being scratched. Oh! I don't think so. You're not on the list. Oh! I, uh... I just wanted to be the first one to congratulate Her Majesty, my niece, the Queen. Yeah, how about when trolls fly. I, um, just wanted to see the boovie. Clawsome! Veronica, in recognition of your dead-ication to acting, the members of the Boovie Academy are proud to present you with the Silver Claw! Thank you. You know, I have made boovies about the Vampire Court, but I have never before revealed that I actually grew up there. I would like to dead-icate this award to the person who made this evening possible. So this is for my friend, Draculaura, who taught me that you need to think beyond yourself, in order to really help others. At this turning point in Vampire history, my duty calls to me, and I am here to help monsters everywhere! What's happening? Draculaura, you got your vamp-powers! You did it! Ghoulia's right! Finding Elissabat and saving the vampires was your big thing. Hey, what are we waiting for? The boovie is about to start, with my favorite royal actress, Veronica Von Vamp! So you're Elissabat playing Veronica playing all of those parts! You have to be the greatest boovie star ever! Thanks. I can't wait to make the next sequel at Castle Dracool with my new screenwriter, cinematographer and makeup artist. Is this seat taken? Look at that chin! He's sitting with me! Wow! Dimples! He's sitting with me! Chill, ghouls, hunk sitting with me. Hush, everyone, the boovie's startin'! Not all of us were meant to do great things. She should be proud that she was born to do something so amazing. I told her that! Sorry! Hoodude Voodoo scream-test take one! I'm singin' in a stain! Just singing and flinging! And singing... Ah! Hoodude Voodoo scream-test take 47! There you are, my precious Vampire Heart! No! That's not ours! We needs to gives it back. No! Get away! It's all mine! Uh-oh. I'm sorry. Is it broken? Was it a real heart? Hoodude Voodoo scream-test take 752. Argh! Rampage! Ar rar rar rar! Oh, the humanity! Oh! Okay, can I do that take over again? I wasn't feeling that one.
