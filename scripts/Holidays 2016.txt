Talent show fund raiser no, no, the talent show that the kids organized for my operation. Aw. Did you really think Mr. Rockwell was trying to kiss your little rat lips? Hmm? Hmm? Hey! I'm talking to you, maxi-pad. No, no, I know, but, you know, it's a nice gesture, you know how much these kids love me. Not like that. No, they look up to me, Kim, all right. And I'd be a real jerk to ditch out on my own fundraiser, don't you think? You really think he'd go for you? Over me? Just wait until he sees the twerking routine we came up with for the talent show. Real Nicki Minaj shit. That's fine. No, no, no, you know what, that's great. Ya, I love you too. Heart and lung foundation Mr, Rockwell, we regret to inform what are you doing to get him a new heart? Did you organize a talent show? Are you gonna perform something? Hmm? Ooh, I know. How about a little game of show and tell? First you show everybody your little friend, Mr. box cutter.

Stop following me. Now look what you did! I... I... I was just kidding. We're going to be late. Well, I thought I had until Friday. Why would you think that? Valentine's day is tonight! Give me your heart happy Valentine's day written and directed by Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer shamrocks. Irish dancing. Parades of green. These are some of the images that come to mind when we think of St. Patrick's day. On weekends I play with my magical whores but who exactly was St. Patrick? And how did he deliver the word of god to Ireland? Horse a land once in the grip of druids, pagans, and devil Worshippers? According to legend, Patrick banished all of the snakes from Ireland by tossing them into the sea. Although evidence suggests there were no snakes in Ireland during the 5th century. Most scholars believe this to be a metaphor. St. Patrick's expulsion of the pagans and mystics. Long may Ireland let slip from memory its paganistic days of old. Hiya, Grainne. That's very pretty. Who is it for? Okay. Look. I know how hard change is, coming to a new school, not having any friends. But I bet if you were to show us that smile just for a second, it would make all the difference in the world. Do you know what? I have an idea. Would you like to ring the lunch bell? Only your deepest wish can make me smile hiya, it's me. I can't chat for long. I'm here waiting for Sam. He's insisted I park away from the school because apparently I'm not cool. He's like, "mum, it's not authentic if I smile." Yeah, it's your holy communion photo, not the dogme 95 movement. My doctor actually recommended I get new contact lenses with "hope" printed on the insides. Apparently clinical trials suggest it may help the cynical wheel of self-loathing from turning. I hate myself. Anyway, I can't wait to see you this weekend for paddy's day. We'll get fucked up, yeah? Find you a man? Day 1 Liz, where are ya? I went back to the bar but there was no sign of you and that Danny Zuko wannabe you were talking to. Would you call me, you think? I'd like you to pick your favorite book, write a page about why you like it, and score the book out of ten. Hand in date is two weeks from today. Okay, everybody, page 38, circles. Day 13 fuck! Hiya, Grainne. What? Now, hang on. That's not very appropriate, Grainne. Mrs. Cullen? You are pregnant. I fucking knew it! I just can't believe it! Oh! I've waited so long for this. However, we're not certain with what. Well, if it's a boy or a girl, that doesn't matter to me. We'd like to run some further tests. Although, if the results indicate a false positive, we'd need to operate immediately and remove it. I'm pregnant. Ooh. Did... did you understand what I said? Mmm-hmm, it's totally grand, boy or girl, whatever I get, I'm happy. I am so happy. Were you with somebody recently, or some animal of some kind? No. Okay, have you ever seen the Hollywood movie Rosemary's baby? Yeah. If you replace '"baby" with "reptile", that's what you have. It's like Rosemary's reptile. Huh? The story of prince Lindworm brother, prince, snake book report love this tale of terror ten out of ten Grainne, what is this? Grainne, what is this? Grainne, what is this? Stop smiling! Day 366 nan just called. She says you look like a 25-year-old woman from the middle ages, spliced with a mentally ill circle. I'm booking an appointment with Dublin zoo. There's no excuses this time, Liz. Hi, can I help you with anything? I'm, I'm really sorry. That's not really, that's not... That's not really okay. I'm sorry. I'm just going to have to take that. I'm sorry. You're going to have to leave. What the fuck are you thinking, Liz? The zoo just called, they said you never turned up for your appointment. I know you're probably saying to yourself, "what if the vet's got it wrong?" Let me impart some important advice I learned a long time ago, the hard way. Vets don't get things wrong. Giving birth to a snake is not only suicide, it's probably the most wrong-headed thing ever attempted in the field of human endeavor. The only thing you have to do to make our family happy is just come home. Alone. Shh. Shh. It'll all be over soon, I promise. Shh. Shh. I need you to help me get clean of this, okay? Horrible, isn't it? You cannot remember. But you can't forget. Grainne, this is your father? Danny fucking Zucko? Our little boy is waiting. Look, I know you think she's different, but she's not. She'll run a mile when she claps eyes on him. Just wanted a normal baby. It's not fair. Blah blah blah. But just look how quickly she forgets. Don't make me laugh. She's the same as the rest of them. I'm so sorry. I had no idea. He'd be so damn ugly. You'd be so beautiful. Very good, little one. Very good. Let's go! I bet there's a whole lotta disenchanted folk out there just waiting for a bouncing snake to lighten up their lives. I bet if we tap into that lonely miserable demographic, in a few short years and a bit of luck, we might just hit pre-Patrick numbers. Oh, my beautiful baby! Only your deepest wish can make me smile st Patrick's day greetings happy St. Patrick's day written and directed by Gary shore time to close your eyes and go to sleep. It's a special day tomorrow. Someone's coming tonight. I'll give you a hint. He's furry. And he hops. And you wake up in the morning and you get... Candy eggs and candy chicks. Yes. But here's the thing. No kid has ever seen him. Because all the kids are supposed to be asleep when he comes. Okay? Okay. Okay. Close your eyes. Wait. I'm scared. Why? Are you afraid you're going to have a bad dream? The man coming back from the dead. What man? Jesus. In church they said that Easter was about him coming back from being dead. What about the Easter bunny? Is he dead too? No, the Easter bunny's different. Is Jesus real? Yeah, he was real. - He was? - Yeah. But he was a good man. And you know what? Yes, he died, but when he came back, that was a good thing. It was a miracle that he came back. He flew up into the stars and he went back where he came from. And he lives in our hearts now. It's kind of like a scary version of e.T. Yeah, but he wasn't a story, he was real. What about the Easter bunny? Well, the Easter bunny comes on Easter. But I thought that's when Jesus came back from the dead. Uh... No, it's... that's different. I don't understand, mommy. Oh, honey, just close your eyes and go to sleep. And tomorrow you are going to wake up and there will be candy chicks and eggs and yummy stuff. But what if I'm awake when he comes? What if I get up and get a glass of water? It's okay to get a glass of water. No, but what if he's here? What if I see him? Shh. Honey. Just go to sleep. Mommy. How does he get in the house? Shh. Okay. I'm gonna count to three, and I want those eyes shut. All right? One. Two. Three. You're going to wake up tomorrow and it's going to be exactly like last year. Mommy? Last year, daddy was here. Will he ever come back? Maybe. Go to sleep, baby. Mommy? This is a dream. You're not real. Touch me. No child has ever seen me. I won't... I won't tell anyone I saw you. I promise. But now that you've seen me. Now it is your turn. You must take my place. Take... take your place? You will see things few have ever seen. Magical things. But what if... What if I don't want to? You have no choice. Can I... can I come back and see my mommy? Where you're going, you will never see your mommy ever, ever again. Now close your eyes. Honey? Honey? Honey?

And you've terminated nearly 20 pregnancies? I've stopped counting. - I'm sorry, I... - It's okay. I've been to see so many doctors. My family won't talk to me. My friends think I'm insane, or making it up, or just... It's... It's like I'm cursed. I don't usually do this. But it does feel like you've exhausted all other options. I'm going to give you my sister's phone number. She volunteers at these weekend fertility ceremonies in the high desert. Maybe she can give you some sort of insight that the rest of us haven't been able to. Thank you. Thank you. It's probably not for me, but I appreciate it. Kate, if what you've told me is true then I don't think conventional medicine can help you. What happens at the ceremony? Well, um, have you ever participated in a peyote ceremony or ayahuasca, or any kind of ceremonial medicine? Well, no. It can be an intense experience. Um, but if you're open to it, I think that you can really learn something. I know I'm going to get pregnant this time. I know it. I know it. Sometimes it takes many times to come here before you do. I think you have to let go of the trying. Yeah, I get nervous sometimes. Make yourself at home. The ceremony will start in an hour. How old are you? Twenty-four. What's the rush? I'm actually not trying to have a baby right now. Then what are you doing here? I get pregnant every time I have sex. Sounds rough. No. No. No. No. You are a gateway. No, I have to go home. No, I have to get out of here. No, I have to go home. No, I don't want to be here. It's just the medicine. Trust it. It's just the medicine.

I guess so. Let me see 'em. What? Let me see those pearly whites. I bet they sparkle. - Let me see those choppers, come on. Yeah. I knew it. You have great teeth. That was... that was... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That was, um, it's just the nerves. That's the problem with these first dates, you know. If people got to know the real me, you know, they would love me. But, you know, they never get to meet me. You know, because it's just... Because the, the nerve monster just rears its ugly head. Most guys I date online just want to hook up. One and done. They act like I'm crazy for wanting something more lasting. Right? You know people say that those dating websites are bullshit but I mean, 96 percent? I mean, like, that's an all-time high for me. I mean my last girlfriend was like an 84 percent and, you know, yeah, no surprise that didn't, that didn't turn out. Mmm. What happened? She, um... I had to... I had to end it. Tsk. It was for the best. Mmm. Sorry. You are so much hotter than she was. I mean, uh... uh... Prettier. Should we get the check? I'm sorry. - For what? - For calling you hot. Why would you apologize for that? Because it made me sound all pervy. Like I was trying to hook up with you. You know. And I know you don't like that on a first date. It's new year's Eve. I'd have to be the most unromantic gal in the world to want to go home to a lonely apartment. Yup. Do you want to go back to my place and watch the ball drop? - Can I take your jacket? - Yeah. Uh, whoa. Whoa! Should I not? Uh, no. It's just. Uh... I need to use the restroom. You know, I just... I want to freshen up. Okay. Great idea. Down the hall to the right. Ryan - Kyle Peter - John - Reggie uh! No, no, no, no, no. Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! Live from Times Square new year's celebration one! Happy new year! Happy new year feliz ano nuevo, carino. A happy new year to you all happy new year's directed by Adam Egypt Mortimer written by Kevin Kolsch & Dennis Widmyer
