That's awful. They don't know why. The Health Service took four months to give me a hearing test and then the ENT doctor told me I've got good hearing despite the ringing. He sent me to the neurologist, who sent me to the psychiatrist. The psychiatrist prescribed tranquilizers and told me to play the radio loud to drown the ringing. Will you hand me that?

It's closed. The ideal reproduction time is in the spring. The female lays three to six eggs, one each day, and that's why the breeder removes the first two and replaces them with plastic eggs. Otherwise, the last birds would die. It's done so that all the birds are born the same day These eggs are plastic and now we put her eggs... Hello, Rosa. What's that? A shoe. Made in Menorca. Size 5.

This morning, I don't know why, I took down a painting that was over my bed and I hid it behind the closet. What is in the painting? It's not a nice painting. There's a man on a horse hunting in a forest. He's just fired three arrows into a deer. There are two dogs. Three wolves are chasing them. The hunter only has two arrows left. You see that clearly. What will he do when the three wolves attack him and he only has two arrows? Well, maybe the wolves eat wounded deer and hunter can run away with his dogs. Why are you running away? You should be at home, with your family, with someone looking after you. And why do you not have children? You children are all selfish. What are you doing? Watching TV. I fixed it.

The pores are almost microscopic but I see them through a magnifying glass. Then I press the pedal and an electric charge goes straight to the tip of the needle and burns the hair. It's very efficient and clean. Each client brings her own needle. It's a very specialized job. All kinds of girls come to my house. Most are obsessed with their bodies and their hair. They're idiots But some have got real problems. They have hair like men, on their face, their neck, even on their breasts. They're very embarrassed when they arrive but they leave very happy.
