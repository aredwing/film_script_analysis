Do you have to pull all the clothes off? Sorry. - Raining. - It would. "Dad wants a cup of tea!" She wants one, she means, greedy old bag. - All right, Mum! I'm up! - I told you, don't call her Mum. I've got to call her something. Anyway, Dad likes us to. He's soft. Must have been to ever marry her! Vi! You've still got your frock on! That's right, tell the whole house! I couldn't undress, I was so tight. - Tight? - Yes, tight. Stinking. Vi! What's it like? Did you go to a party? Fella took me to a roadhouse. Didn't get back till after three. - Doris! - Just going! - Got a hangover? - Yes. I'll bring you a cup of tea. That theme without words The song we first sang The first day that we met That cool fragrant music I'll never forget... That's quite a nice voice you've got there. - Do you really think so? - Yeah. It's not at all bad. Untrained, but I've got an eye for talent. I've always wanted to sing in a band. - Do you think I'd be good enough? - Could be. You enter for that crooning competition at The Palace. I'll teach you a thing or two in the meantime. If you win, we'll take you up west for one of the big competitions. I've got a lot of pals who'll help you, if I give them the word. Oh! I liked that tune! It's a good number, bad arrangement. Wish I had a record of it. You come round to the shop in the morning, and I'll give you one. - Pick what you like. - Ooh, thanks! - Enjoy yourself, kid? - It's been lovely, Morry. - What time is it? - Two? Three? Who cares? Who cares? I've got a key. You've got everything. Sam! - Back again? - Been here hours. - Of course. - Three teas. Better unload that lot quick. They're not the sort of stuff you can shove under the bed. - Who are we gonna try, then? - Not old Neesley. Not after the way he did us last time. - Diabolical liberty-taker, he is. - Ta, Sam. Say we get half a dollar a pair, what's a gross of half dollars? About...about 20 quid. 18 quid, if we get it. Six quid each. - Soaked to the blinkin' skin. - A fine night's work That's what comes of Whitey's information! 800 quid in the Peter, wasn't there? Sweet Fanny Adams! If you can get any better information, bring it along. Mind if I have a butcher's, Sam? I done a dog in the last at Harringay. Tommy Swann's got his skates on. That makes it perfect. We shall be flogging this lot with the law on every corner. Ah! The Ritz! Lovely weather for a manhunt. Tommy Swann won't be fool enough to come near this manor. "Smith", "Brown", "Smith". "Williams". Did you ever feel Whitey Williams' collar? Punch-drunk that goes round with Freddie Price and Dicey Perkins? No. Why? I've got a hunch they did that warehouse last night. What did they get? The joke's on them, the safe was empty, and all they collected was a gross of kids' roller skates. My oldest's been whining for a pair of roller skates for his birthday. If anyone offers you a pair cheap, let me know. - I will not! - Where is that old bag? All right! Morning, Mrs Spry. Just having a look at your visitors' book. I see that. What do you want? Extraordinary what a lot of Smiths and Browns stay here! I don't give 'em their ruddy names! - Mind if we look at your guests? - All the same if I do, I suppose. It's taking a ruddy liberty. This is a respectable house. Oh, I'm sure it is. Well, I'm not stopping here catching me death of cold. One moment. Do you remember this man? Can't say I do. Who is he? You might know him as Tommy Swann. He was pinched here once. Well, I can't remember the face of every bloke what stays here. He ain't here now. I thought he was inside. He was until yesterday, but the naughty man ran away. And ruddy good luck to him. It's my duty to warn you, if you're harbouring this man... I know! I'll be rendering meself liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years. I still ain't seen him. And I'm going back to bed. Good night. - Get out of it! - Bunch of bosses' lackeys! Raining. Always ruddy well rains on Sunday. What was all that row in your room last night? Cat came in through the window, knocked the chair over. Sounded more like an elephant. Thanks, girl. You can get the breakfast started. All right. - Any murders? - Don't seem to be. You'd have thought somebody'd murder somebody, wouldn't you? - Bloke escaped from Dartmoor. - Mm? "Thousands of police throughout the country were put on the alert tonight "as a nationwide net was spread for a convict "who had made a daring escape from Dartmoor. "The man is Thomas Edward Swann..." - Tommy Swann? - "..seven years' penal servitude "for robbery with violence." Why? Do you know him or something? Used to be a Tommy Swann come into The Compasses. - I don't remember him. - Before you moved here, probably. There's a photo of him here. Same bloke? Yes. Same bloke. Two light ales, please. Two. - You look as if you need one. - Thanks. - All the best. - All you wish yourself. - Ever get a night off? - Thursdays. - What do you do? - Nothing. Why don't we do nothing together one Thursday? - Go up west? - Why don't we? I wish there was no such place as Bethnal Green. No pubs, no jobs. There isn't. Not till tomorrow. Present for a bad girl. Tommy! Oh, Tommy. Do you really mean it? I've got to go up north tomorrow, on business. Soon as I get back, eh? Oh, dear. Is that the taxi already? I'm afraid not, Rose. - What's the matter, Guv? - It's Tommy Swann. He's been arrested. - What do you mean, arrested? - Smash-and-grab raid. They caught him in Manchester. What's for breakfast? Haddock. Cannot be purchased under ten guineas. I'll take nine guineas. I'll take eight guineas. I'll take three pound. I'll take 45 shillings... Here we've got a nice one for a lady going away. I tell you what I've got. I've got a big size for a lady coming back. Outsize? I've got one 'ere with charabanc fittings, Mrs Woman. Any gentleman that loves his wife, loves every acre of her. Now, there's a cracker... Now, ladies and gentlemen, I've got the finest selection in Petticoat Lane Market... The last one! I've got another last one. And this is the other last one... - Hiya, Sarge. - Hello, Slopey. Looking for bargains? Or Tommy Swann? - Tommy Swann? Who's he? - Give yourself a break. This isn't the usual police court stuff. Front-page interview, I want. Thanks very much. The last time I was on the front page of "The East London Courier" was when Nick Henderson got damages for wrongful arrest. Mazel tov... Ladies and gentlemen, dusters that you can't buy anywhere else in the world. And the price, ladies and gentlemen, comes in the region of every working man... - Morning, Mrs Wallis. - Morning, Mr Fothergill. Want a pair of nylons for the wife? Guaranteed stolen goods. Not today. It's about an old friend of yours, Tommy Swann. Smart boy, Tommy. First he gets away from me, then he gets away from Dartmoor. It's my duty to remind you that, if you see him, you're to report it. Don't worry, I'd shop Tommy Swann as soon as kiss your hand. Good girl. Mm. Governor of the Duke Of Teck won a badge. I beat him when they came and played us in the league. 19, 12, double top, I finished. You and your darts. - Any errand you want done, Dad? - What are you after now? I want to earn another two shillings to buy a mouth organ with. - You think I'm made of money? - Bertie Potts is going to buy one. Nothing doing. You make enough noise with your mouth! We'll have to find something to cover that up with. Vi, what did we do with the blackout stuff? - It's in the Anderson. - Go and get me a bit of it. Can't. My nails aren't dry. Tarting yourself up to meet your boyfriends! Nice way to spend a Sunday morning! It's all right. It's me. Tommy. Tommy! You gotta help me, Rosie. I'm on the run. I know. I've seen the paper. Oh, you shouldn't have come here. I've been on the run for 12 hours. Had to hide up somewhere till dark. You're soaking! You'll catch your death of cold. I'd be all right if I could get some grub. Haven't eaten since dinner time yesterday. I'll try. There are four of them inside. I'll have to wait until they've all gone out. Just some grub, Rosie. That's all I want. I've got to go back in. They'll be wondering. I'll come back soon as they've all gone out. Clumsy fool. Those plates cost money! And don't scowl at me. - I wasn't scowling. - That's right, call me a liar! What's up? Why don't you keep your kids in order? You sit there listening to her calling me a liar, and you don't say a blinking word. Strikes me as though you both want a dose of salts. Good hiding, that's what she wants. When you've finished the paper, perhaps you can fix that for me. I'll fetch you the scissors. When you put them on of a morning, you'll never regret... - Morning, Mr Hyams. - Morning, Mr Fothergill. - How's business? - Ah, so-so. Much demand for roller skates these days? So-so. Why? Idle curiosity. Well, mustn't waste any more of your time. Your breakfast's on the table. You tired, Morry? What else should I be, working till three o'clock in the morning? Fresh cut! Take your pick! Here you are, then! They're lovely daffs! I'll have some daffs, Bill. Bob a bunch, Mrs Hyams. Take your pick, all fresh cut. You go to the dance last night, Bill? Took Minnie Fraser, the Scots piece out of Fielding Street. She's a nice girl. You'll be getting married one of these times. Me and Minnie? Nothing like that about us. - Still, we enjoyed ourselves. - You must have had a late night. I never stay late when I'm grafting the next day. Besides, the dance was all over at 12. Course. I was forgetting. Your old man seemed to be enjoying himself. Yes. He likes his work. Here, I'll take the lot. - Coffee was cold. - Why didn't you make some fresh? I work all day in the shop, all night with the band and I should make me own coffee. You'll ask me to scrub the floors next. What am I, a charwoman? - Where'd they come from? - Bill Hawkins' barrow. I told you before not to buy from the barrows. How much? - Six bob. - Six bob? I could have got 'em for half a crown. - Maybe you could've, but you didn't. - If you want flowers, ask me. Why buy 'em retail? Anything you want, I can get wholesale. Wholesale, retail. What's the difference? What's the difference? Saying it with flowers, Morry? Hello, Lou. Sadie's gone mad, absolutely meshuggah. Why else would she marry a schlemiel like you? She's a nice girl, Sadie. You ought to get to know her some time. I brought her some stuffed olives. Put them under the counter. - That's where they come from. - Thanks, Lou. Morry, would you be interested in a gross of roller skates? - Roller skates? - Mm. You know, with wheels on. What is this? My wife buys a barrow load of flowers. My brother sells me roller skates? Am I supposed to play Santa Claus to all the kids in Bethnal Green? Sell 'em. That's what people do in shops, so I'm told. - You can have the lot for 15 quid. - I can't afford to take risks. OK by me. I don't stand to make anything. Just trying to help some blokes. You could make something towards that 50 quid you owe me. Lou, I give you my word I haven't got it. On my life, my Sadie's life, the baby's life. All right. Your life will do. So long. Where you going? To get some fresh air. Don't worry. I'll get it wholesale. You going to be all day with that bath? Your dad's got to have his. There's no hurry. It's early yet. It's not a very neat-looking job. I'll shove a bit of ply in instead. Oh, George, that'll do for the time being. Just as you like. What's the matter? - Nothing. What do you mean? - You look sort of queer. It's my heart. I've been getting some nasty twinges lately. - Just plain wind, more likely. - Keep your sauce to yourself. I won't be in to dinner. Ted's taking me to Southend on the bike. - All right, then. Run along. - In this weather? Giddy life you two lead Water's hot. You going to have your bath now? Mm? Er... Outside, you. You're underage. Not you, kid. You're legal all right. Thanks for nothing. Well? Sorry, Mr Hyams. Can't do it under a score. - Ten now and ten after the fight? - Mm-hm. Ta. Second round? - I'll make it look artistic. - Sure. Sure. A kid like you shouldn't smoke so heavy. - I'm getting the knack of it. - Don't get too good. You'll ruin me. - Wait till I get that wristwatch. - Present for the boyfriend? - Nosy, aren't you? - Same old story. Boyfriend gets starvation wages and you're a typist at the gasworks. - How do you know where I work? - A little bird told me. She works there too. Stinks, eh? Your cheesy watch, it's glued on. Could be. Smart kid like you ought to do better for herself than the gasworks. I bet you say that to all the girls. A beauty parlour, now. You'd look good there. I got a share in a place up west, classy joint. There's room for a girl like you, if you're interested. Interested in what? Interested in a better job, of course. This is strictly on the level. Same like the watch. Ooh, it's smashing! My car's around the corner. Can I give you a lift anywhere? No, thanks, mister. I've got a date. You were kidding about that job, weren't you? No. Any time you like. It's worth five quid a week with tips. - I'll have to think about it. - Sure. - Ask your dad. - Half a crown, tulips! - Goodbye. - Half a tick. Half a crown a bunch! Just to show there's no ill feeling about the watch. So long, kid. Fresh cut this morning. You got a bargain, Mr Hyams. - I've got a soft heart, that's all. - Yeah, that's all. Better hurry. They'll be open in a couple of minutes. Oh, there's plenty of time. Brewery delivered yesterday. I'm off. - What about it? - Sorry I spoke! - Anything the matter, Rosie? - No. Why? You just don't seem yourself today. I'm all right. I expect you need a bit of a change, being shut up in the house all day. Tell you what! How about us going out somewhere this afternoon? - Going out where? - Anywhere you like. Pictures? - Do us both good. - I haven't time. - I'm behind with my mending. - Oh, leave it. What? And have you grousing about holes in your socks? Oh, well. Just as you like. I thought it might do you good. Come on, hop out of that bath. I want to get on with my dinner. Right you are. I didn't know what to think. The watch was on the level... - The watch was on the level? - Oh, yes. I thought those machines were fixed, but they can't be. - Look! Isn't it smashing? - Yeah. And tomorrow there'll be a smashing fur coat. And next week, a smashing little flat over the beauty parlour. All strictly on the level! - Ted, if you're insinuating... - I ain't insinuating anything. If you think Lou Hyams goes around giving girls jobs and flowers for their own good, you're crazy. You think he's a welfare officer? Lou Hyams has got brains enough to see through you. He has, has he? I'll thank you not to shout at me, seeing as I'm not deaf. You couldn't take that job, anyway. Why not? I can suit myself, can't I? No, you can't. It's him or me, now get that clear. I can do without both of you, thanks. So can I, too. Hey! Just a minute! You've forgotten Lou Hyams' daffodils. Seen my pipe cleaners anywhere? Oh. Ah. Get along, for goodness sake. You're in my way. Fine thing, master of the house turned out of his own kitchen! - Tommy. - Yes? When I say now, make a run for the house. Now. - Morning, Mrs Sandigate. - Morning, Mrs Watson. Nice weather for ducks and aspidistras! Well, I must go and get the dinner on. What you got today? Beef. I got a nice bit of lamb and mint sauce. I never think lamb's quite the same without mint sauce. No, nor do I. Well, I really must go and get mine in the oven. What was that? Woman next door. It's OK. I'm sure she didn't see. I can get you some hot food in a bit. There won't be anybody back till dinner time. Is there anything I can have now? - Bread and marge. - That'll do. It's cold in that shelter. You'll die of cold, going out there again. - Too bad. - I've been thinking. You could go upstairs to the bedroom. - Hm? - It's the safest place. - You said there'd be no one back. - Shut up and hide. What are you doing back? I thought you were out all day. Ted was kept on a job at the garage. - I want a vase for these. - There isn't one in there. Yes, there is, the blue china. Seeing you're back, you can make yourself useful. I forgot the cheese ration. Run round to the lane to get it. OK. Where do you want these put? On the dresser, I should think. How long's that hot grub gonna be? The sooner I get outside again, the better. Not long. But go upstairs, like I said. Be able to dry your clothes. I'll get you out again this evening, as soon as he's gone to the pub. It'll be dark by then. Come on, Tommy. You've got to get some sleep if you're gonna make a run for it tonight. OK, then. Suppose your old man wants a nap after dinner? Always has his nap downstairs. I'll lock you in, and keep the key on me. Get those wet things off. You can put these on while I dry 'em. Your back! - Was that...? - Yes, it was. Pretty, ain't it? That's what you look like after the cat. Some time after. Just after, you look like a lump of raw meat. When I come out the hospital... Them nice kind people send you to hospital when they're finished. When I come out, I used to lie in bed and feel them scars and swear I'd beat 'em and get out of there. And I got out. - Here, just you feel 'em. - I don't want to feel them. I don't want to look at them. Seems funny, me sleeping in your old man's bed. What's he like? He's all right. He's decent to me. Why'd you come here, Tommy? I reckoned they'd think I wouldn't come to the East End. To me, I mean. I reckoned you wouldn't let me down. I've got to get away somewhere, Rose. I still had three years to do. And if they get me, I'll have lost me remission. I'll do meself in, sooner than go back there. I'll get you some food. Thank you, Mr Hyams. - Morning, Mr Hyams. - Morning, Edie. Those are on me. I'll 'ave me usual. No sale. Sorry. - He's too broke or too scared. - You wouldn't take 'em yourself? - Let you have 'em for 12. - Don't tempt me. I tried to help you out but you know I never play crooked. - Cheerio. - Good luck. Good luck. - I suppose you boys are stone cold? - Not got half a dollar. They ain't worth a light. Pay me back when you get shot of the stuff. - Ta, Lou. - Thanks, Edie. Well, I got to blow. So long. He's a good boy. And don't forget, we owe him a oncer. Yeah, better go round to see old Neesley this afternoon. Then the kid comes in with a right hook and Bob's your uncle! Hope I'm not intruding, boys. - Oh, good morning, Mr Fothergill. - Have a drink? - You know what you can do with... - We don't mind if we do. - I'll have a large Scotch. - Yeah. Me too. You boys are getting expensive tastes. Beer turned sour? Any self-respecting beer'd turn sour... You know how it is, Mr Fothergill. We couldn't drink common beer with you, could we? Couldn't you? Four bitters, please, Edie. You're very quiet, Dicey. A still tongue makes a wise head, eh? - Been doing any driving lately? - Driving? No, of course not. How can I drive with me gammy leg? It's hard enough to walk. You've got a driving licence up to date, though. I'm working in the market now. I never know when I may have to do a bit of driving. Even if it does hurt me leg. - Who are you working for? - Me cousin. Oh, I see. Which cousin is that? - Me oldest cousin. - Oh, I see. By the way, somebody did a warehouse in Great Mansell Street last night. Drove a van load of kids' skates out of the yard. The van was dumped near Hackney Marshes. There were fingerprints on the steering wheel. - Good luck. - Good luck. Good luck. Nothing remarkable about that, is there? Fingerprints on every steering wheel, isn't there? You're right, Freddie. Dead right. I never thought of that. 'Ere, why aren't you out looking for Tommy Swann instead of mucking about in boozers? It's easier to catch three little sprats than one large whale. Cheerio. Be seeing you. There's another one here... The gospel ship Is sailing along... Nice singing! Shut up! Yeah, I'll do you an' all! Right, sir. I'll order that for you right away. Run along, sonny, unless you want to buy something. I want one of those mouth organs. ...Drifting to your doom Drifting to your doom In the ship There's left but little room... Sixpence short. Mister, can't I owe you sixpence? I'll bring it in next Sunday. Get another sixpence, sonny, then you can have a mouth organ. Join the happy throng Saved for evermore You are drifting Drifting to your doom Drifting to your doom Drifting to your doom... Well, well. Look what the wind's blown in. - Am I glad it isn't the landlord! - Good morning, Morry. Morning. And what can I do for your Ladyship this morning? You promised to play me some records, or don't you remember? Do I remember? Step inside. The tree tops are swaying The soft wind is playing That beautiful theme Without words The wet leaves are... When IS that competition you were talking about? We'd better go a bit slow on that. The voice is there. The personality's there. - We'll have to improve the diction. - I see. Standard's getting higher all the time. You've got to be pretty good to get anywhere these days. - Right, sonny. Run along. - Kissing my sister, eh? I'll tell your mother. She told you not to come round the market. - I'll tell Dad you kissed that man. - Don't tell lies. - You saw 'em, didn't yer? - Yeah. Now, sonny. You wouldn't want to get your sister into trouble. - Yes, I would. - I want that mouth organ. I've got the sixpence now. I want a mouth organ, too, but I haven't got any money. Will you be a good boy if I give you a mouth organ free? Yes. Don't you want me to be a good boy, too? Thanks, mister. What a morning! Think he'll say anything? I'll skin him if he does. I'll get your records, miss. - Nasty morning, isn't it? - Very. Anything more you require, miss? Needles? No, thank you. Good day. Good morning, miss. Quite a lot of records for sixpence ha'penny. She didn't pay cash. She's...just opened an account. I see. She opened it last night, I suppose? I don't follow. There was no extension to the dance last night. Such a fuss! Did I say there was an extension? Me and the boys were rehearsing a bunch of new numbers. Now look, Morry, I know all about you and your little shiksas. I've known a long time, even if I haven't said anything. But I'm not going to have them come into my house. - But, Sadie... - Morning. Yes, madam? There you are. - Smells good. - It's only vegetables and gravy. Daren't cut the joint. But it's hot. I put your clothes to dry. This and dry clothes, I'll be all right. I could do with some money, though. 15 bob of the housekeeping left you can have. Thanks, but 15 bob won't take me far. - Where are you making for? - Docks. Try and get a boat to Cape Town. You'd better take that. You can sell it or pawn it. Nice stone. - Yes. - Ought to fetch quite a bit. - Won't he notice it's gone? - He doesn't know I've got it. Huh? Where'd you get it? Had it given. - Don't answer it. Let them go. - I've got to answer it. - I daren't not answer it. - You heard! Don't answer it! I've got to answer it. They'll tumble the whole thing if I don't. Mrs Sandigate? - Yes. - I'm a police officer. I've come to see you about a man known as Tommy Swann. He escaped from Dartmoor yesterday. I understand that you and he used to be on friendly terms. Tommy Swann? Yes. It was while I was working at The Compasses. He used to come in quite a lot. Haven't seen him for years. Even then, it's possible he might turn up and ask you to help him. Think so? It's my duty to warn you that aiding an escaped criminal is punishable with two years' hard labour. Catch me getting into trouble over a crook like Tommy Swann. It's just a formality, Mrs Sandigate. - No offence intended. - And none taken. - Police? What did they want? - Wireless licence. - I thought Dad had paid it. - Then you thought wrong. It doesn't look fresh, but it's all they had. Don't give it to me. Put it in the dish! Get the dinner on the table. I've got enough to do. All right. That smells good. Nothing like a game of darts to give you an appetite. What we got? - Beef. - Oh. Half a mo. Ta. - You've come into money? - I've been saving up. Didn't know you knew how. You were going out. Something wrong with love's young dream? Ted was kept on a job at the garage. He's a twerp. Don't know why you don't give him the air. Ted's all right. Pity you can't find a decent chap like him, my girl. - 'Ere! Where'd you get that? - A man gave it to me. - Likely! If you pinched it, I'll... - A man gave it to me, honest. - You ask Vi. - That's right, Dad. In the shop when I was buying the records. The man said he'd throw it in, seeing as I was a good customer. Petticoat Lane isn't what it was if they start giving things away. There's a big plate missing. I can't find it anywhere. - Take a pudding plate, then. - I have. - A bit overdone, Rosie. - If you don't like it, don't eat it. You know, Lou, it's good to see you home. - You're a stranger, almost. - I must come round more often. I'd nearly forgotten what good strudel Bessie makes. You ought to pack up the shop, move out of the East End. Why? You in the removal business now, as well as pin tables and bookmaking? - And where should we move? - Stamford Hill, like Uncle Nathan. Your Uncle Nathan, yeah, yeah. A great big house like a castle. A big motorcar like a charabanc. He hasn't paid for either of them. What's wrong with the East End, anyway? - It smells. - Certainly, it smells. Of markets and fish shops and pubs. And clubs to keep the boys and girls out of 'em? That's not what the clubs are for. At least, ours isn't. - I'll tell you something, Lou... - All right, Bessie. - Get off your soapbox, eh? - Bessie and her club! What do you think? They will turn the old hall into a fine new gymnasium. What about a subscription from the wealthy member of the family? - How much do you want? - Altogether, 50. Might be able to manage a fiver. Depends how much I win on Chuck Evans' fight this afternoon. If Mr Evans wins. Loses. I'm paying him to take a dive. In that case, the club will get along without your 5. Dirty money! Ach, Lou! Does the colour of the money matter if it's to be devoted to a beautiful, noble cause? Well, I gotta blow. Thanks for the dinner, Bessie. I suppose it's no good asking if you've had a visit from an old friend today? If you're insinuating anything about Tommy Swan... He might be in need of a little light refreshment. We don't cater for the criminal classes, Mr Fothergill. Turned over a new leaf, have you? There's such a thing as the law of libel. There's such a thing as ham, too, but not in this sandwich. Hiya, Joe. Sausage roll, please. Great minds think alike, eh, Sarge? Been grilling Joe about Tommy Swann? And how! Be a real guy, Joe. Give us the dope. Tommy Swann was here this morning wearing dark glasses and a long black beard. - What...? - Nothing. What's diction? Well, it's the way you speak, aitches and things. Talking nicely, like the announcers on the wireless. Why? Nothing. Just wondered. What you knitting? - Pair of socks. - Who for? Ted? No, Dad. - You and Ted had a row? - No. Well, yes. Someone offered me a job and Ted thinks he isn't on the level. - Who? - Mr Hyams. - Who? - You know, runs that arcade. - That's fair enough. - What? Oh, nothing. Can't see in this glass. Where's my mirror? - Have you taken it? - No. Rosie borrowed it, most likely. What are you playing at, making that row? Your door's locked. If you've got my mirror, I want it back. - Well, you can't have it back. - It was my own mother's! - I'm gonna have it back! - Come out of it! Come out of it, I tell you. My new dress! Look at it! You've ruined it! - You rotten fat cow! - What did you call me? - Stop it, you two! - You keep out of this, Doris! What's going on here? You all gone mad? Look what she's done to my dress! I'll teach you to call me a rotten fat cow! Doris, what happened? - She tore my dress and hit me. - I didn't ask you. I asked Doris. She borrowed Vi's hand mirror and Vi wanted it back, that's all. Rose, why don't you let her have her mirror back? Who's stopping her? Let her go in and get it. - How can I? Your door's locked. - It is not. Sticks with the damp, that's all. You'd better get some clothes on. Better make her buy me a new dress! I've got something to say to you. You didn't get in till three o'clock this morning, and you were drunk. - I never... - Shut up! I've given you a free run. I thought I could trust you to behave decent. I was wrong. - Dad... - No, Doris. You can't help her with any more lies. Well, it's got to stop. You'll be in at ten and tell me where you've been and who with. You can't treat me like that. I'm grown up. Not so grown up I can't tan your hide if you don't do as I say. Now get some clothes on. That's the blasted limit! Did you tell him about me coming in late? - Of course not. - I bet you did. - You're all against me. - Vi, I didn't! Oh, get out of it and leave me alone. And the brave little boy said, "Don't you come in here!" And the lion said, "I'm going to eat you all up!" Grr! - Morry Hyams speaking. - 'Morry?' - Oh. Who's that? - 'It's me, Vi.' - Oh, hello. How's tricks? - 'I've walked out. 'I've had an awful row with Rosie and Dad.' - Oh. That's too bad. - 'When can I talk to you?' Well, er... It's not easy, you know. You've got to help me, Morry. I've got nowhere to go, no money. I've got to find a room somewhere. Well, look, Sid, come round to The Palace this evening, we'll talk it over. I'll see what I can do. Right, goodbye. That was Sid Feiner. Lost his job through being sick. Wants me to take him into the band. It must have been a very bad sickness to give Mr Feiner a soprano voice. - You Lou Hyams? - Not just now, son. - Business before pleasure. - It's about Doris Sandigate. Nice kid. I want her to stay that way, see? - Does you credit. - Now, look 'ere, Lou Hyams. She told me about that job and I'm warning yer. Lay off. Excuse me. Come on, Brown! Look, sonny, why don't you get your facts straight before you start bellyaching? The first thing I told Doris? She's got to get the old man's OK. George Sandigate's known me since I was in short pants. If he says nothing doing, nothing doing it is. Anyway, since you're so keen to muck up the kid's chances, it's OK by me. I don't want to muck up her chances. Not if they're the right chances. Look, I've been watching that kid. She's got style, acts like a lady. The kind we need for a class joint like ours. But for me personally? No, thanks. I like my paloneys free and easy with nothing to lose they didn't ought to lose. Looks like I made a mistake, Mr Hyams. Say no more about it, son. Six, seven, eight, nine, out. A very plucky loser! Then you think I ought to stick on at the old gasworks? Every time. Well, thanks very much, Mrs Hyams. Not at all, Doris. Come again soon. Afternoon. - Why, Mr Hyams, isn't it? - That's right. My sister told me you needed a hand with this gymnasium. - I thought this might help. - Thanks very much. Cup of tea, please. Lou. What are you doing here? I didn't know you knew Doris Sandigate. - I didn't know YOU knew her. - Small world. She told me about that job. I've warned her off. Warned her off? What for? You were on the make for her, weren't you? You'll never know now. Mr Hyams! Magnificently generous of you. Boys and girls, attention, please. Mr Hyams here has made us a magnificent donation of 50 for our new gymnasium. I want you to give him three rousing cheers. - Hip, hip! - Hooray! - Hip, hip! - Hooray! - Hip, hip! - Hooray! You boys. Stop desecrating the Sabbath like that! Afternoon. Mr Neesley in? We'd like to see 'im on business. Sorry, but Mr Neesley don't see anybody on business on Sunday. Yeah, but this is important. This is highly confidential... Can't you see I'm talking to the lady? Well, I'll try. No need to take it out on me in front of the old mare. - Made me look a right mug. - Your mother did that. Or your father. I'm not sure which. Oi! What does this mean, coming here in broad daylight, Sunday afternoon? You think I want this house known as a rendezvous for jailbirds? Just a minute, bees knees. Not so much of the jailbird stuff. You've been glad enough to see us in the past. Now you don't want to know us. OK. We'll pass the news round you're going out of business. I'm sorry, boys. I lost me temper. I can't afford to take risks, you know. No, but we can, can't we? Don't matter about us. Don't let's fall out over a few hasty words. What have you brought this time? We've got a gross of those. They sell at 15 bob a pair. Mm, very nice. Very nice, indeed. But my skating days are over. Don't waste my time. I can't use stuff like that. Mr Neesley, you've got to take the rough with the smooth. We're doing a job at Chingford on Tuesday. We only want something to tide us over. Well, if you boys are hard-pressed, I don't mind helping out. - What are you thinking of asking? - A couple of handfuls. 10? Oh, really! No, the most I could possibly offer you boys would be... 5. 'Ere, if you're... Well? OK. Five nicker it is. On delivery. We'll have 'em round in the morning. Stop arguing. Do you want to prefer a charge or not? Oi! Get out of it! Shh. - Oh. It's you. - Talk quiet. He's asleep downstairs. How are you feeling? Better. Fine. Well, you don't look too fine, even now. When I think of what you used to look like. With your smart suits and your fancy ties and your manicures. What have you got out of it, except those scars on your back? I was dead unlucky. First time I was shopped, and they had me taped after that. I made a mistake, tried a different kind of job. If I'd stuck to smash 'n' grab, I'd have been all right. Maybe. - Don't do that! - I've been away a long time, Rose. - You mustn't do it! - Well, you used to love me. You bleedin' fool. Why d'you think I'm doing all this for you? - Because I USED to love you? - Do you still, then? Oh, I don't know. I don't know anything today. After you came out the first time and you didn't come and see me, I decided I'd forget all about you. It was just then that George asked me to marry him and I thought, "Why not? "He's been good to me and I'll play fair with him." Only now and then, something would make me remember, like when I saw your photograph in the paper this morning. I'd remember every moment we'd ever had together. Oh, Tommy! I'll come back. Mum! Mum! Where are yer? Mum, what d'yer think? There was a man with a barrow of flowers... - What is it this time? - There was a barrow of flowers. A car came round the corner and knocked it clean over. Pity he didn't knock you over, too. Now, you go out and stay out. - How about a cuppa, eh? - All right. Salvation! Salvation! Is good for me, good for you Salvation! Salvation! Is here for me Here for you... Good evening. Mr Neesley at home? - He is not. - What a shame. I've got a warrant to search the premises. - Good luck. - Good luck. - Nearly skint again. - Yeah. Nearly skint again. What do we do with all our money? You mean what we're gonna get for them skates. That ain't money. That's it, tell the world. Why don't you get on the counter and shout? That ain't money. That's chicken feed. That's peanuts. - Old Neesley's a ruddy old thief. - And a ruddy old 'umbug. Him and his church organ. Sunday evenings, don't he always go down to Bow? That's right. Plays the harmonium at the Seaman's Mission. Why? - Cos I'm gonna do 'im. - Shut up! I tell you, I'm gonna do 'im! I'm gonna do 'im, good and proper. Not just for the sake of putting the boot in. Don't forget, he always carries a century in 'is sky. That's clever Robbery with violence. - Know what you get for that? - The cat. Just the same, I'm gonna do 'im. I'm gonna do 'im real right. Dirty old thief. I'm gonna do 'im. Evening, boys. Where's the third musketeer? - Huh? - Where's your pal, Whitey? How should we know, Mr Fothergill? Gone to church, I expect. Of course. Will you boys have one for the road? - We ain't going anywhere. - Oh, yes, you are. You're coming round to the station with me. If you're still looking for a story... Thanks very much. I'm not. Evening, precious. I'll have a large gin. Doris, I've been looking all over for you. Same here. Your landlady wouldn't let me in. She said it wasn't that kind of house. She can go and chase herself. Have you caught a cold? Can't be helped. I wanted to say I was sorry. You've got nothing to be sorry about. Oh, yes, I have. I've seen Lou Hyams. He's OK. Well! So, I take back all I said. But I've seen his sister and she says he's not OK. - I was gonna take back all I said. - Well, I'll be... - I'll make you a hot cup of tea. - No, you will not, Mr Edwards. - Now, look here... - Never mind, Ted. I'd better run you home. Can't we still go to the pictures? I don't know. What time is it? It's only ten past seven. Here. Never mind. Make up for it next Sunday, eh? - This table's engaged. - I want to give you a few tips. You're going to run Morry's home when I leave, aren't you? - Well, I... - You see, he's got some funny little ways I think you ought to know about. He was spoilt as a child. Won't do a thing for himself. Thinks nothing of making you get up in middle of the night to get him a hot-water bottle. He has to have tea in bed every morning. And he's so fussy about his appearance. Though why he should be with those short legs, I don't know. Even his dress shirts I have to wash at home. Quite often, one can get the lipstick off with breadcrumbs. But... Hello, Morry. We were talking about you. As I was saying, about the housekeeping money, it's no good going through his pockets, he hides his money. - Don't you, Morry? - Sadie, why do you say such things? Because I'm leaving you, Morry. What do you mean, leaving? Leaving. Goodbye. - But, Sadie... - Here, what about me? - What am I going to do? - Oh, leave me alone! - Cor! - It's just a matter of practice. - Let me try. - All right, then. George, it's time he went to sleep. Mum, I was just learning how! You heard what I said, Alfie. - Good night. - Good night, Mum. - Night, son. - Good night, Dad. Remember, Rosie? Florrie Ford sang it, Hackney Empire. - Did she? - Mm. Time we was off to The Compasses. Mind if I don't come tonight? Got a bit of a headache. All that fuss this afternoon. Nice drop of Guinness would soon put that right. It's so stuffy and smoky at The Compasses. I'd rather stay here quiet, if you don't mind. Oh, poor old girl. All right, then. I'll stay, too. I can't, though. I forgot. Promised to play in the Buffaloes match. You and your darts. I'm going to be late. Like me to bring you a bottle of Guinness back? - Yes, do. It'll be nice. - All right, then. A lot older than you, isn't he? 15 years. You'll need a shirt. Mm. - Evenin', Mr Sandigate. - Evenin', Edie. Pint, please. Where's Mrs S this evening? She deserted us? No, been a bit poorly all day. - Oh. Nothing serious, I hope? - No, I don't think so. Thank you. She'll be 'aving a good cry over old times, I dare say. I don't get you, precious. Maybe that's why she didn't feel like turning out. Used to be a friend of Tommy Swann. - Who? Him? - No, 'er. Mrs Sandigate. Met in this bar. Crazy about him, she was. Nearly married him. Yeah? Now, she could give me a real human interest story. - Give you a black eye, more likely. - Listen, precious. When I want a story, I get it. - What's the address? - Hm! No 'arm in trying. - 26 Coronet Grove. - Be seeing you. Shot, George! Now's your chance, George. That badge'll look fine on that suit, George. - Oh, well done, George! - Pints all round, Edie! I knew I'd get it one day. Pity Rose wasn't here to see it, though. Well, thanks, Rosie. You might try and let me know where you get to. If I make it, I'll send you a card signed Bill. If I don't make it, you won't need a card. Just my luck! All I can do is help you get to some place where I'll never see you again. If I get fixed up abroad, you can come out. It's too late. Why? Just too late, that's all. Ten years too late. Anyhow, you don't really mean it. You might think you do at this moment, but you don't really. No, you'll...get to Cape Town or wherever it is and... find yourself a girl. Just send me a postcard, that's all. Goodbye, Tommy. Now, scarper before I make a fool of myself. - Bloke. - Cop? Dunno. You get out quick. I'll stall him. - Does Mrs Sandigate live here? - That's right. - I'd like to see her, please. - Alfie, get back to bed this minute. - Mrs Sandigate? - Yes? I want to talk to you about Tommy Swann. You can't go now! You've got to tell them that you made me hide you! - Let go of me! - I won't! You've got to tell them! Sadie! Sadie! Sadie, stop! - You can't walk out on me. - Why not? Sadie, you can't. What shall I do? You'll find some little shiksa to wait on you. Listen, Sadie. I've been bad to you, I admit, but... Sadie, please don't leave me. Hey, stop! Stop! Sadie, the car! Mrs Sandigate. 26 Coronet Grove. Right, Slopey. Thanks for the tip. Stolen car. This is it. Shove your lights up, George. Get that out. Add, "Driver believed to be Tommy Swann." Get down to 26 Coronet Grove. Pick up Mrs Sandigate. - Tommy Swann. - I need dough. Lots of dough. - How much you collect? - Well, here's a 20 for you, Tom. Thanks. That's big of you, chum. Have you seen...? Whitey Williams, I want you! Hold him. I never did it. I recognises that it's Tommy Swann. I wouldn't do the old boy, I... I suppose he gave you the watch as a consolation prize? Come off it, Whitey. Whistle up another man. Get a doctor to examine the body. Take Williams to the station. Straight on, soon as you can. There he goes! Back! Better go back. Right, Sergeant. I'll warn the men. Come inside. 'Everybody listen, please. 'There's an escaped convict in the yard. 'He's wearing trousers and shirt, no jacket. 'If you see him, report immediately.' Needle in a haystack. We had a Home Guard exercise here. The whole company out looking for me all night. Never got a smell of me. Come on! Better spread out. They caught him. Out near Leyton. It was before I met you. - I had to help him. - Don't worry about that now. You've got to get well quickly. How are we going to get along without you? Alfie. I left him by himself. He was frightened. He's all right. The girls are back. They're looking after him.
