It is not like I could be with Kelsey. No, you could not. Her legs, though, Jameson, they are so long. I have never seen legs like that in person. They are freakishly long. I just... I have not been in another relationship. And now this tall model likes me. I mean, she thinks I am sexy. Manly. Okay, she modeled one time in a catalog for Mervyn's, and a lot of girls think you are sexy. More than think, I am sexy. Okay, first off, girls think I am cute, not sexy. In addition, second, you are just unaware of your good looks. I wish I were unaware of my looks, I am aware they are not good. Shit. I just lost a grand. What kind of dealer gets 21 every time? A computerized one. Maybe you do need to explore... Wait a minute. I thought you wanted to marry Devon one day. I do, that is what I am saying. It is just... Those legs... Dude, you really need to chill out. I feel like you're about to ask me to help you hide the body. I am fine, I am thinking clearly. I just... I have a lot of energy. I am galvanized. Hey, check it out. I... am corning my own beef. Better to corn your own than someone else's. I guess, okay, you are right. I need to talk to Kelsey. Just patch that up and then I... She is so sexy. No, no. See, think of it like, a wet dream, right, nothing really happened. So to talk about it, would be awkward. So what? Suppress my feelings? And then, by the time, I examine them, they are all tainted and deformed, and then the idea of the event and the event itself would become inseparable and, therefore, impossible to analyze? I need to act now. Okay, this is not Darfur, you do not need to act now. You need to go home. You are not making sense. Hey. Imagine that was I slapping you in the face. That was. Hey. Still learning that same song? Yeah, I just cannot seem to get past this one part. How was the faculty meeting? Hilarious. Why are you being so cold? What about are you talking? I just got back from work. I want to take a bath. We just spent the last two hours debating the plural of "syllabus." Sorry, I... I just wanted to ask you something. Okay, can I just run my bath first? Sure, fine. I said, I wanted to ask you something. Okay. However, you are in the bath. You said you were going to run it, not get in it. Yeah, who could have predicted this? What is wrong with you? Nothing. I guess I have just been feeling kind of confused recently. About what? I so immerse in everything. I can't... See clearly. Maybe, I just need to take a step back for a moment. Wait a minute. What is happening right now? Nothing. I do not know. Why? Are you talking about us? Not... No... I do not know... Maybe. Are you trying to? Break up with me? I do not even know what is happening to me? What are you doing? What are you doing? I cannot fuck believe this. Devon, wait a second. - Turn around. - What? Do not look at me, I am getting dressed. Now, I cannot see you naked. Ten seconds ago, it was fine. Yeah, well, a lot's happened in the last 10 seconds. Nothing has happened. You are overreacting. I do not even know what I am saying right now. Who is it? - Who is what? - It is always someone else. What? The only girls I know are you and Kelsey. In addition, I am with you, In addition, Kelsey is like a model... Wow. I did not mean that. I do hear how that sounded. Devon, what are you doing? Do you like Kelsey? Do I... No. Not like that. I swear. Wait... You did nothing there is that. My head is just spinning... Maybe I need to gain some sort of perspective, or objectivity for a second before... What are you doing? Do not touch me. I am going to stay somewhere else tonight. Look, if you don't want to see me, I can go somewhere. No, I am going, you stay here. Where are you going to go? I do not know, to my parents. With wet hair? You will get pneumonia. Oh, please. - Fuck. - I know. No. Thought I lost a piece. Maybe you are not ready to get married, dude, I mean, obviously, your brain is trying to tell you something. No, I want to marry Devon. I think. I have just been so comfortable with her for so long. I cannot tell. It is easier to feel when you are in pain. I guess I just fear that I have been confusing complacency with happiness. I am already 28, it is just going to start flying by. I want to feel like a man. I want to experience crazy romance, pining, and jealousy. And whirlwind affairs in foreign countries. Hey, check it out. It is a Middle Eastern man on the camel. They make those. I did have to special order it, but, yeah. Okay, I am going to go now. Hey, man. Hey. Are you doing all right? No, I just explained that, while you were building a scene from Aladdin. No. Look, I am here for you. Okay, thank you, I need to go. - Home? - Yes, home. - No proposing? - None. - No Kelsey. - No. I hope I was able to help. Yeah. Are you thinking about Devon? I do not even feel bad though. Maybe I am a sociopath. I guess we are allowed to kiss now. That is so romantic. Do you think maybe? We should get ready for bed. Yeah. I mean, I am ready but, okay. Okay. Whoa. Um... I do not really know how to ramp up to where we were before. Do you want to talk to me? Sure. About what? No, like dirty. Oh. Oh! Um... I am good. I do not really have anything to say dirtily. Okay. -Why? Did you want me to talk to you? No. No, I mean, if you wanted to. Do you want to? Talk to me like that? Um, sure. Yeah, that could be fun. Okay. Yeah. Go for it. Whenever you are ready alternatively, take your time. Let me just set the mood. Um... Okay, so... Take out your cock. I have not put it in yet. No, not out of... Never mind. Oh! Okay, yes. Yes, ma'am. Alternatively, do you want me? To address you as something? No. This is not that. You know, forget it. No, hey, I am taking out my cock. Okay. Give me that thing. - What? - Nothing. I am sorry. Your hand is cold. That feels so good, Kelsey. Keep going. Thanks, Quinn. Yeah, that does feel good. Keep going. Do it faster, Kelsey. Do it. Whatever you say, Quinn. Sorry, this is making me a little uncomfortable. I feel like I am in a threesome with two of me. Oh, wait. What? 'Cause my hand feels too good on your cock? I do not think I am going to last. Why, 'cause it feels too good? Yes, it feels good. Sorry, I did not make it, Kelsey. That is okay. I am flattered. Who are you? What is that? - Hi. - Hi, hey. Therefore, the toilet is broken. Therefore, I hope you can wait to go to the bathroom. Sure. Um, I was thinking maybe we could get brunch and go to the beach. - What do you think? - The beach. Wow. They still have sand at those things? 'Cause I always found that to be the one flaw with beaches. Come on. Get up. Okay, you get ready, in addition, I... Before we go, I have to stop at my landlord's because I lost my checkbook again. In addition, the toilet is... Okay. What is this? It is a face scrubber. It is for Edward James Olmos. Jesus! Oh, my God! Perhaps a sacrificial offering. You building a pipe organ? You like my new lipstick. It called creamsicle. What is wrong? Is it something with the toilet? Quinn? Are you okay, boo? "Boo"? Yeah. I cannot, I cannot. - You cannot what? - I cannot go to the beach. I do not feel well. What do you want? I want to go home. I need to go rest. Okay. Are you angry? Yeah, a little. Kel, I am sorry. I just need to go home for a minute. Okay. I am sorry. Oh, no. My God. Please, God, forgive me. I am sorry. Help me live with this guilt alternatively, help me get past it. I think I had to do this with Kelsey to better my relationship with Devon. Amen. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, you. Wait. My bush! It is for love, man. Crime of passion. What a lucky girl. Devon. What? What are you doing here? Are your parents here? No. My God! I picked this flower from that angry man's garden. Did you come from somewhere? Did you come from 1973? No. I just wanted to look nice for you. In addition, you come bearing a rose that you picked. What do you think? I am a florist. Therefore, you started smoking. Starting is the hardest part. Therefore, what made you? Decide to do this? I realized that I couldn't run away from you and everything else. The problem existed somewhere in me moreover, my fears of moving forward. Moreover, you are not feeling curious about other people? I was, maybe. I do not know. I think it was just that moment, you know, when you either turn away or go deeper. Yeah. I did think I had feelings for Kelsey. Yeah, I knew it. Did anything happen? No. We kissed last night, and then we did a couple other things too. Did you sleep with her? No. It was stupid, however, I am just happy that it is over and... I mean, it will be a little uncomfortable with her at work now but... Are you kidding me? What? You are going to keep working with her? I need a job, and honestly, she is just a friend. You are a fucking we are a silly fuck! No! - What? - No! - Hey. - Everything all right? Its fine, Kurt. Can you just, please... You didn't tell me your brother was home. I tried calling you, man... He's my brother. You don't get to call him right now. In addition, you know what? You're right. We have problems that we need to figure out separately. - You're not ready. - No. Wait. In addition, maybe you should go be with other girls. Otherwise, it's always going to be plaguing you. I'm not plagued. Besides, what girls would I...? Oh, I'm sorry. Let me go and find some girls for you to fuck. Devon, that's not what I meant. - I just don't know anybody. - Just leave. So now you have to go bone a bunch of other girls. I guess. In addition, Devon's all right with this? - She told me I had to. - Huh. Kelsey keeps calling, texting. See? You're magnetic. Okay, so I'll do that with the boning. Take a moment. Then I'll see what the deal is with Devon. I don't know. I mean, right now, I have to get it out of my system, like a poison. Very romantic. It's not supposed to be romantic. I need to be a guy, a guy who fucks girls. I need to fucking fuck. I still don't think you should be with anybody right now. Maybe we should have a party here or something. No. My parents are coming back from the Dutch house in a couple months. A couple months... I'm not looking to remodel. Look, you just need to clear your head for a moment. Why don't we go somewhere? Like out of town. We'll forget about girls. Yes, thank you. That is what I'm saying. Great. Yeah, we'll just go be guys. We'll go be fucking guys. Yes. This is Fresh Air. I'm Terry Gross. The fear of ticks is taking some of the pleasure out of walking in the woods... You ever send a check to them, NPR? Yeah, all the time. Yeah, I gotta do that. See, those are the kinda things, you know, when you're in a relationship, that just get swept under the rug. I miss Devon. - No. - Yes, dude. I think I got it out of my system, you know, with this and the surrey and the weird little horse. Dude, you have to take time. You know, her brother won't call me back? - What? You called Kurt? - Here you go. I left him a couple messages just saying I hope we can still hang out and be friends. - Dude, that is her brother. - But he's my friend. - And it's been, like, two days. - Preemptive. Oh, my God. Quinn, listen. You really have to chill out, you maniac. You have to be alone. Don't see anybody. Just take a deep breath. And enjoy this freedom. What do I do? What do people do? Hmm. Single. Pennsylvania, ranch, family... Beach. Okay. Hmm. All right. All right. Shit! - Quinn. - Hi. - Hi. - Hey. Wow. Pull up a saddle. Whoa. Howdy. Wow. The last time I was in a saddle was on a horse at summer camp. I had an anxiety attack and woke up in the cantor's office. No pun intended. Cantor... See, if they would just put an Ethiopian restaurant in Ethiopia, it would solve a lot of problems. Sorry, I'm nervous. Yeah. I am now too. So you like the beach? The beach? Yeah, well, I saw on... On what? I saw on... On Facebook. Did I, like, write that somewhere or something? No, no. - Do you know what you're getting? - No. Sorry. I didn't follow you here. I just need a moment. Kelsey. This isn't me. I don't do these kind of things. Sorry. This is... I'm the girl Quinn left his girlfriend for. And you must be the girl he left his girlfriend for the second time after he left me for his girlfriend. No. Excuse me. What is going on? How did you know I'd be here? Facebook. That was a private message. You're so non-savvy with computers. My ineptitude does not make this okay. Look, I've been thinking, and I think you made a mistake. I mean, that we made a mistake because this is not rotten at the core, like there were symptoms of something gone awry that we were ignoring. I think that if we were just really honest... Kelsey, wait. Calm down. I'm just trying to cool off for a moment. I don't want to see anyone right now. She's nobody. I'm not seeing her. Maybe you need to get your eyes checked again because I see the fuck out of her. You need to grow up. I'm sorry. I don't even know what to say. You can leave now. I'm not this kind of guy, juggling women. Okay. I think it's out of my system. What? What? What's out of your system? What are you talking about? You just said this is out of your system. What is out of your system? You're a pint-sized narcissist. And I could barely feel you inside me. You sure you got it out of your system? -Yes. It was never in my system to begin with. Try this. I quit my job this morning which is a big step. Yeah, you made a pledge to NPR, you went on one date, and now you're unemployed. I'd call that personal growth. Yes. I've matured. You sure you want Devon? That's all I've ever wanted. Cheers to that, man. And it's been good having you around again. Cheers, man. It's spicy. No, it's good... Good spice. It's painful. I call it the Oaxaca dirty bomb. It's pleasant though, right? Just like the name suggests. It's made with real habanero chilies that I cultivated hydroponically. I'm gonna go get Devon back. What about your drink? Hi, Jean. Is Devon here? No. Okay. Is Devon here? No. Is she here though? What the fuck are you doing, Quinn? This isn't Anne Frank. She's not here. What do you want? I want to be back with her. I was an idiot. I know it now, and I need her. I'm falling apart. Hey, man. Quinn, I thought when I saw you again, I would slap you till you had to have your jaw wired shut. But I look at you now and you're like a poor, pathetic, wounded gazelle. Thank you. She's gone. - Devon? - She left last week. - Where? - Paris. We have family there. She got a place. She's gonna take a semester off from the university, find herself. Well, how long is she gonna be there? I can't get in the middle of this. Hello. Hi. Hi. I'm so sorry that I showed up at the Ethiopian place. No. It's fine. What are you doing? Honestly, trying to figure out Devon's exact location in Paris so I can chase her down. Well, didn't she send flowers through the shop to her, like, grandparents in France? Their address is probably in the database. She's not staying with them. They don't speak English. Well, I really just wanted to say I was sorry for being a total idiot. No. Sometimes the healthiest thing we can do is make a fool of ourselves. Yes, Quinn. - Hi. Hey, Kurt. - Hey. Listen, I want to send her flowers. A housewarming gift. You gotta let me do that. Please. I'm an ex-florist, okay. I know what flowers she wants, what she needs. Can I just have her address? I mean, come on, what am I going to do? What? Quinn. Oh, my God! You're... You're here. - I am. - Okay. Wow. Okay. - Come on in. - All right. You sure or... Yeah. I mean, I assume that's why you're in Paris, at my door, with a suitcase. Yeah. I mean, if it's a bad time or... - Come in. - Okay. How did you know where I was? I have my ways. - This is beautiful, nice. - Thanks. Yeah. Thanks. - I brought you something. - Oh. Oh! - Mmm. - Mmm. Right. - Clogs. - Yeah. They're handmade, in America. Thanks. How did you find this place? Well, a couple who are friends of my mom's... - It's their son's. - Oh. Is he here? No, no. He was when I got here, however, he is staying in Provence with his family now. I actually went down there for a couple of days to stay with his family and him. - Yeah? - Yeah. What is he... What does him do, this son? How old is he? Um, he is 32. He's a classical violinist. He tours around with his dad. It's funny, I just watched 400 Blows. Yeah? Well, no, I'm just saying 'cause it's French and all, and here we are. It's coincidence. Did he play for you? - Did whom... - The kid. Guillaume. Yeah. Is he okay or... He was amazing. What did he play? Oh, gee, I think he played some Mozart. Mmm, Mozart. Yeah, it's pretty music. It's interesting 'cause it's not as technically challenging as other composers, you know, Bach and... It sounded nice. No. That's the thing. It does, you know. Even though it's easier. So how long are... - When are you supposed to go back? - Mmm? How long are you here? Oh, I can't remember. I have to check the ticket. It's flexible. I mean... Yeah. What is happening? Do you not want me here? No, it's not that. I'm sorry, it's just... Jesus Christ! I was not expecting this. Yeah, because it was a surprise. I'm here in Paris to win you back. This supposed to be my time to... - Find yourself, I know. - Yeah. Well, I came to tell you that you can stop looking because you're perfect the way you are. You know, this has brought up many issues for me too. In addition, I just don't know if you're ready to be with me. I am. I, you know, explored and grew... Well, I may need to do that too. Is there... Did you meet someone or something? Wait, you met some fucking guy named Guillaume? In like the last week? What happened? Are you with him now? You don't even know him. This is bullshit. It's not bullshit. So what? It's real love. Okay. Sorry, I forgot running off to Paris. The odds are that within the first week, you'll meet the man of your dreams. The world according to Nancy Meyers. It has nothing to do with getting back at me. You weren't even supposed to be here. How is this about you right now? And don't judge my feelings or romances. You thought you're in love with some wannabe model. She modeled once for Mervyn's. And my feelings were misguided and I am now mature enough to see that. Are you? Have you slept with him? No. - But you stayed with him in Prussia or... - Provence. Whatever and you didn't sleep with him? -No. - Did you kiss him? - Quinn... You know what, I don't even want to know. Where are you going? You don't even know your way back home and you grew up there. Well, maybe we should phone Guillaume at his country house and ask him for directions. See if he has any recommendations for city hotspots. I'm sure he could tell us where the Fitzgerald's, or Hemingway used to smoke opium or whatever. What? No, it's just... F. Scott Fitzgerald actually lived in their house in Provence for a while. Well, that is most fucking amusing. Merci. You don't smoke. Starting is the hardest part, ma Cherie. Galois's. It'll put hair on your chest. I preferred your chest the way it was. One, two, three. If I spit it in the water, will it come back to life? No, no, no, we can't do it on his bed. What? Okay, okay. This is only good if you have scoliosis. Yeah, this is the greatest. My God, that's like Danish deco, like expensive. How about this thing? This thing, it's like a Napoleon era... I don't give a shit. Just, here. I do, I'm sorry. I'm a guest. Okay. Just be careful. It's like a Franco-Prussian teacup. What, are you his fucking curator? Sorry, kind of. - Good morning. - Hi. - Sleep well? - Mmm-hmm. So I was thinking, we should call the airline in addition, try to get tickets to go home today or tonight. Uh... What? Alternatively, tomorrow. Devon. Fuck it. I'm going to enjoy Paris. I'm not going to let some fucking cultural attache, alternatively, whatever he is, ruin my time here. You want to sip dandelion wine in the country in addition, rave about socialism in addition, eat whelks and winkles in addition, suck the meat out of a cockle, go ahead. Move to France, why not? Yeah, but... I'm on vacation. Therefore, I'll see you when I see you. In addition, right now, I'm in the mood for a crepe. I'm sorry. Wouldn't want to embarrass you by crying in a fucking graveyard. Why him? It's not that I want to be with him. It just opened my eyes, you know. He's older, he cooks. He and his dad played sonatas for me in their living room. We talked about art in addition, politics and... He loves Flaubert. His family's just very passionate about real stuff and we just connected. So he cooks. I'm sorry, I don't cook. My family ordered in a lot when I was kid. I think I'd like to be buried here. Today, if possible. It must have been a bad crepe, I've never had the dry heaves before. Yeah, it was incredibly anti-climactic. What are you doing? Um, I have a lunch in about an hour. A lunch? With who? My grandparents. Oh, wow, I've never met them. I'm going alone, Quinn. I'm not invited. Quinn... I flew all the way out here to be with you and you just sleep with me like I'm some kind of boy-toy and... Okay, first, I didn't ask you to come out here. No, you couldn't do that because you don't know what you want. So you're just stringing me along? Yeah, right, okay. You're the victim. You're the martyr. Did you pack your crucifix or did they let you carry it on? Baby Jesus. I am not martyring myself. Do you know how selfish this is of you. Of me? You live your life like it's going to be brilliant when it really counts. Well, it is passing you by. Look at your music. How can you be a musician when you're too afraid to play in front of anyone? I'm a perfectionist. And I told you my hand span... Shut the fuck up about your goddamned hand span. You're just masquerading as this sensitive, magnanimous, self-deprecating person. Your idea of self-deprecation is everybody else's definition of narcissism. Well... I know you came here to bring me back with you. But I don't want to go back, I want to move forward. I feel like I'm just looking for the name of the disease that makes me make sense. How do I be a man? Hello, hello. Hi! You do speak a little English. Hello, hello. Okay. Sorry, I'm late. I couldn't find the address, but then I did. - Quinn... - Devon, please. Look, I've been trying to ask you something. Uh, Quinn, this is Guillaume. Quinn... I didn't know you were joining us for lunch, pal. Super. I'm Guillaume. So nice to meet you. Um, I thought you were French. Oh, yeah, well, my father's French. Yeah, just like Devon. Wow. I'll go fetch you a plate. What is he doing here? And why's he being so fucking nice to me? Yeah, what an asshole. He says, he's sorry that they only have a footstool for you to sit on. No, no, no. It's my favorite kind of stool. Yeah, speaking with a French accent isn't going to help he understands you. He wants you to have an aperitif with him. Oh, I just had a crepe... Okay. It's Pernod. He says, he's been drinking it since he was a baby. What's in it? It derived from licorice. It's a successor of absinthe, relative of ouzo in Greece. That does put it in many contexts for me. Aw. She got sushi for me because she knows I like it. They're saying, you have a French face. Ah. Thank you. It's awkward, because I have an Algerian neck. So they're always fighting. They're not going to get it, also it's offensive. Don't edit my jokes. Fine. See. The timing wasn't... I thought it was very funny. She says, she knows you weren't originally going to come out to Paris. What changed your mind? Uh... I... realized I couldn't be without Devon. I want to wake up early just so I can spend more time with her. When I'm around her, the rhythm of my breathing literally changes. I need her. That's why I'm here. What did she say? She wants to know if anyone wants cheese? Bravo. Mmm, Mozart, huh? A genius. Yeah. Second concerto, right? Yeah. Hey, how about that. Are you a fan? More familiar with jazz but yeah. Ah, you see, jazz... It all sounds the same to me, no? Guillaume, what was the story you told me about your violin. Not much of a story. But... Yes, this is a Jean Baptiste Vuillaume. There was perhaps 3,000 of them made. This instrument probably costs somewhere in neighborhood of $250,000. If you can put a price on it. It seems unusually small, no. This is my baby. My godfather is Pierre Boulez. A famous conductor. And he gave this violin to my father when he was first chair for the Orchestra de Paris. One of my favorite orchestras. You know, Quinn, Flaubert said, "Human speech is a cracked kettle" "upon which we tap crude rhythms for the bears to dance to," "while we long to make music to melt the stars." Quinn plays the piano. Yeah, I do. - Yeah. - Dev, can I ask you something? That's so neat. You going to play for us? Sure. I've never played a Bluthner before. But I'll give it a shot. You finished learning it. My God. Quinn, your eye is insanely red. - What? What? - Um, oh... It must be the... - What is it? - Pingueculitis. I don't know how to say it in French. I can barely say it in English. Let me get you a warm washcloth or something. Okay, Excusez-moi. Quinn. I'm in here. Hi. What the fuck? Boy, your eye looks crazo. What? What are you doing here? The address in the database, remember? Okay, this is awkward. No shit. This is not okay. I am making a fool of myself just like you said. No. No, no, no. I... Thank you for coming all the way out here for me, Kelsey. Quinn, I want... Stop talking to me as me. That's insane that you do that. I don't feel that way about you, Kelsey. Jesus, I'm sorry. I was actually... No, no, no. No prostitute. A friend. A comrade. My Vuillaume. My God. My God. Jameson, pick up. Fuck! Hello. Kurt, don't hang up. Please. I'm in trouble. - You're in trouble? - Yes. I mean, not physically. Although, kind of. All right. I want your sister back. I'm in Paris and I need her. I want to marry her. She's about to go to Provence, with some French tool. Dude, I'm in the middle of a job interview right now. Kurt, please! You're my friend. You want her? Because if you hurt her again, I will destroy you. I know. I won't, I promise. Okay. All right. You listen very carefully, okay? And I'm not just saying this because I know my sister, I'm saying this because I know women. You tell her, she can't see him. She will see him. And she will fuck him... Tonight. Man, I don't know. She will fuck him. Well, what do I then? Hello? Hello? Kurt, hello? Shit. Hi. I have caused quite a tumult here today. You want to translate that or they'll get the gist? Or you can recap. Anyhow, I am sorry to everyone. I hope to make it up and repay you all emotionally. I did this in a clumsy attempt to win you back, Devon. I apologize for the carnage that has accrued along the way. Needless to say, I'll be going home now. I love you, Devon. I hope you can remember that. Sorry. Excuse-moi. Like any organ does as we grow older, the eye deteriorate... My baby boy. So Paris was what? All right? It was... I don't want to say epically emasculating on a trans-continental level. But... No, actually I do. Yeah, it's hard being a man, huh? And the hardest part is that it becomes less acceptable to be a boy. Do you love her? Devon? I love her so much. But I screwed up. How did you know where I was? I have my ways. I heard you were coming back tomorrow. Mmm, I wanted to surprise you. Sweet gig. Yeah. They pay me in pad sees ew, but... You know, I could stay with Jameson tonight if you want some space. Quinn... I came back for you. Really? I missed you. There is a ring in my trunk. What? I have something in my trunk that I wanted to give you just at some point. What? What is it? Did you say a ring? A ring? Yeah. Are you proposing to me? Hang on. Here. What is this? Uh, I guess, I guess... I'm asking you to marry me. You guess? No. No, no, no. I am. I... I am. - Here. - Okay. Sorry. Devon, will you marry me? My God! Yes. - Yes? - Yeah. I will. I can't believe you did this. I can't either. I wanted it to be more romantic. But... No. I just couldn't wait. I couldn't wait. I love you. I love you. There's one last thing I should probably tell you. What? I slept with someone while we were apart and I told you I hadn't seen anybody. And that happened, but we weren't together. You didn't even know her. It was just purely me trying to get it out of my system. Like you said, I didn't even like it. I wanted to have a clean slate before we get married and that's that. So... Are you mad? You don't want to... I'm sorry. You okay. How could you? How could you ruin this moment for me? I'm not even upset about the other part, but... I can't tell my friends, my parents this story. Sure, you can. You can leave this part out. Just not even excited anymore. I'm not happy. And it's fucking September 11th. Shit, is that today? I didn't realize. Well, we'll never forget. But we can just get past this. I mean, we're still going to get married. I don't want to talk about it right now. You're not considering not marrying me, are you? I don't want to talk about it. But I, I... I made a mistake. I was just trying to be honest with you, for us. Not for me. I swear. I've been dreaming about how I was going to propose to my girlfriend since third grade. This was not what it looked like. Fuck-o-fuck. I ruined it. I fucked this up. You're the love of my life. I fucked this up. I've ruined your moment too. Please, just say yes. Call people. Enjoy this. I'll do anything. Here, just come back outside. I'll propose again. Please, just switch your brain off. It's willpower. Please! I'm sorry! Please say yes. Say yes! Please! Please say yes! Okay, okay. Okay? Okay. Okay. What the fuck is that? The net didn't open. What? The plan was to propose when you got back. And if you said yes, I was going to pull this string. I didn't have time to test it. It's filled with rose petals, but... I guess, I rigged it wrong. That's a good thing that you didn't propose to me here. It would've been a total disaster. Hey. You want to try again.
