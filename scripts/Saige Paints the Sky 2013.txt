And on the first day of school, no less. I had to get out there and draw. Everything was just so beautiful this morning. Gotcha. Hey, hey, hey. How's my fourth grader? Morning, Dad. You excited? Totally. Tessa just got back from music camp, and I can't wait to see her. Do you know this is the first summer we haven't spent every single day together? Do you know this is about the hundredth time I've heard you say that? And I know you're also excited about all the cool things you're going to learn this year, right? That too. Hey, I want you to check this out. They're almost done sewing the fabric for the balloon. It's gonna be ready just in time to fly at the Fiesta. It looks amazing! I can't believe my design is actually going to be turned into a real balloon. I mean, just imagine what it's gonna look like at the Fiesta. The sky's gonna be filled with all these hot-air balloons. Yours is gonna be up there with us inside of it. That's pretty cool, huh? Totally. To my very talented daughter. I don't mean to break up your little brunch, but this artist is on the verge of missing the bus. I'm on it. We'll see you at Mimi's for dinner? Okay! Bye! Bye. Crazy. The show... Oh, that song! It was so hard to learn. I know. Oh, I missed you so much! Jinx! Okay, you first. How was camp? It was beyond! It was more than beyond! They'd have to invent a new word for how beyond it was! She's right. I learned all these cool vocal warm-ups and met other girls who love music just as much as I do. Totally changed my life. Oh! You know Dylan, right? She was in Mrs. Martin's class last year. We were in the same cabin at camp. She's an incredible singer. Oh, yeah. Hi. Hey! You're the artiste, right? That's pretty cool. Um, yeah. Thanks. So, how was your summer? I feel like we haven't talked in forever! Um, it was fun. I painted a... Speaking of fun, Tessa and I did this crazy duet at the end-of-summer talent show. Let's do it! One, two, three, four! Don't let them tell you that you dream too much. Don't let them tell you that the world's too rough. They should be making time to have some fun. 'Cause we do, 'cause we do, 'cause we do. Clearly, we totally rocked the house with that song. Yeah, that was... First place, baby. It was amazing. You're a crazy girl. Good morning, class. Everyone, please take your seats. I'm Mrs. Applegate. Everyone, this is Gabi Pea. She just moved here from South Albuquerque. Let's welcome her. Hi, Gabi. Go ahead and take a seat. Hi. You're Saige, right? Yeah. Have we met before? No, but I moved in just a few doors down from you. I've seen you in your yard, drawing. I'm kind of an artist, too. I design my own clothes. And I drew these. They're cool. Not as cool as your grandmother's stuff though. My mom told me she's Mimi Copeland. Yep. She's pretty awesome. At my old school, my art teacher took us to see her exhibit at the art museum. And I've seen her every year, leading the parade at the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta. You're so lucky to have a famous artist in your family. I'm actually going to her house today. You should come over and meet her some time. I'd love to. So, let's get started. We are going to have a fantastic year. I've got lots of very exciting activities planned. But before we get into that, there are just a few things I need to announce, some of which won't be easy to hear. Due to budget cuts, we unfortunately will not be having art class this year. What? From now on, art and music will alternate. This year, it's music. I know this is disappointing news, and I'm so sorry. But at least you'll get art back next year. Mimi. It's me. Anybody home? Hello? Mimi. Hey there, Rembrandt. Hi. How you doing? Yeah? Have you seen Mimi? Have you? No? Okay. - Hey, Luis. - Hey, Saige. How you doing, Georgia? Where's Mimi? Right out there. Hyah. Whoa! Mimi! Hey! Come on. Hyah. Do the parade gait, Mimi! You bet. Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Yeah! Go, Mimi! Yes. Now try the scarf trick! Coming right up! Let's show them, Picasso. Let's go. Whoo! Go, Mimi! Come on! - Whoo! - Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! Yes! That's what I'm talking about. - Whoo-hoo. - Whoo! Yeah! Great job. Hey, hon, you wanna go for a ride? Georgia's all saddled up. - Hyah! - Giddy-up! - Hyah! - Here I come! Whoo. Watch out! You know, Mimi, that scarf trick was amazing. It blows me away every time. I don't know how you do it and get Picasso to do the parade gait at the same time. I'm thinking of doing that scarf trick again this year when I lead the parade at the Balloon Fiesta. You have to. It's a tradition. I could never lead a parade. The thought of a huge crowd staring at me makes me want to throw up. Well, I was nervous the first time I performed in front of that crowd. Something wrong, hon? No. Come on. You know you can tell me anything. Well, today was the worst day ever. Our teacher told us there was no art in school 'cause of some dumb budget cut. And Tessa made a new best friend at music camp. So you had a rough first day. A new school year, and things are different between you and Tessa. Change is hard, but we can't let that scare us. But I don't want things to change. I know. Sometimes it's good to shake things up a bit. Race you. You're on. Hyah! Come on! Whoo! Dinner's in the oven. I hope you're hungry. I made enough red chili tamales to feed a city. Saige, that's great! You're developing a wonderful sense of texture. Oh. Well, I'm not done blending. Wait. Maybe you should try the impasto technique. I mean, it would take your painting to a whole new level. What's the impasto technique? Well, instead of blending out and hiding your brushstrokes, you get a painter's knife or palette knife, and you show the strokes on purpose. This was one of Van Gogh's favorite techniques. Look. You see how freeing it is? The paint just glides on there. And all those beautiful, happy accidents. All those colors mix. It's just so freeing. Here. Wanna give it a try? No, thanks. I'm pretty into my brush. Maybe another time. Remember, hon, it's important to try new techniques if you want to grow as an artist. I know. But I really like my brush. And I think I'm just getting good at this stroke. Maybe next time. Do you think you'll finish the mural in time for the Fiesta? Well, that's the plan. I'm thinking of calling it Portraits of Albuquerque. What do you think? I think that's perfect. 'Cause the Fiesta wouldn't be the Fiesta without one of your world-famous paintings. I'm so lucky I get to paint with you since we don't have art in school. But it still doesn't seem fair. Well, if you really think it's unfair, maybe you should try to do something about it. Like what? There's nothing I can do. I'm just a kid. Rembrandt! Rembrandt! Mom and Dad must be here. Mom, it's good. Hot sauce is fantastic. Not too spicy? I like it. I think I got carried away with the red chili. Hey. You still thinking about your art classes? Yeah. I just don't get why art should be less important than anything else. That's what you're gonna say when you fight to get the program back. Who said anything about fighting? Saige, artists never give up, especially when their ability to express themselves is at risk. Artists never go down without a fight or at least a protest. Do you really think a protest would work? Why not? At least you can try. Sometimes the causes most worth fighting for are the ones you're not sure you can win. Do you remember that time that old adobe building was gonna be destroyed, and they were going to replace it with a little mini mall? But then you convinced half the city to show up with signs to save it. And then Mom rides Picasso through the crowd, just chanting through a bullhorn. I think you made national news with that one. Guilty as charged. But it worked. And it could work for you, too. All artists have a voice, and you have one, too. Clearly you haven't heard me sing. I'm not talking about that kind of voice. Now, an artist's voice speaks through her work. And you won't be alone either. There are a lot of kids who like art. And music. This could be a great way for you to reconnect with Tessa. I never thought about it like that. Hmm. I'll talk to you later! There's no need for fear. 'Cause I know I'll never be lonely. When you're here, my gray skies turn blue. You understand me I smile when you're around. The sun's so much brighter, it's true. Always forever. Whatever the weather. We stick together like glue. Forever and always. Good times and bad days I always know what to do. 'Cause I've got a friend just like you. 'Cause I've got a friend just like you. 'Cause I've got a friend just like you. 'Cause I've got a friend just like you. Hey! You sound really good. Thanks. It's a song Dylan wrote at camp. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Super cool. So, Mimi had this idea I wanted to talk to you about. You know, how we're not having art this year? Yeah, then no music next year. I know. But I was talking to Mimi, and I think we should do something about it. Start a school-wide protest. And we can get a bunch of other kids involved. And then next year, you can have music again. A protest, huh? Like the Boston Tea Party? Something like that. I haven't figured out all the details yet. I think that sounds... Awesome! Great! Hey, listen, I'm going to Mimi's after school if you want to come hang out with me while I paint. Totally! I feel like we haven't done that in forever. I'm supposed to go to Dylan's. Oh. Well, maybe tomorrow. You know, it's all good. I can just meet up with her later. - I'll ride the bus with you after school? - Perfect! Oh, and then I can show you the sketches for my balloon design. You're still gonna fly with us at the Fiesta, right? Uh, hello? In the gazillion years we've been friends, have I ever missed flying in the balloon with you and your dad? I can't wait! Oh. See you later. Bye. Should we go through the harmonies again? Sure. From the top? Hey, Saige. Oh, hey. I wanted to see if you can come over after school. I downloaded this Japanese anime movie. The drawings are so cool. Uh, today? Yeah. Sorry, Gabi. I'm busy. Maybe we can hang out later in the week. Oh. Okay. See you in class. 'Cause I've got a friend just like you. Sometimes I wish I was a star. Blinking brightly from afar. Looking down on everything. Thinking of the light I bring. Sometimes I dream I was a fish. Swimming everywhere I wish. Moving smoothly through the world. But I'm always glad to be a girl I look up to the stars at night I know that everything's all right I can be anything I want. When I grow up, I'll chase my dream I'll change them to realities. Who knows the things I could achieve. If I can just always believe in me. Ta-da. Keeping the faith Think of the things you'll see. If I can just, if I can just. Always believe in me. Always believe in me. So then, Tessa started playing her guitar, and it was just like it was before she went to music camp. I feel like I have my best friend back. I am so happy for you, hon. Oh, quiet, Rembrandt. That dog's gonna eat me out of house and home. I've gotta get him a dog biscuit. Keep talking. I can hear you. Oh, quiet. So then Tessa and I started painting and laughing, and singing and... Mimi? Mimi? Mimi! Mimi! Mimi! Mimi! Mimi! My leg. Luis! Luis! What's going on? It's Mimi! She fell! She tripped over Rembrandt. He was so excited to get his treat. She's going to be okay, Saige. She's a very strong woman. But I feel like I could have helped her. It's not your fault, okay? Trust me? Okay. Mimi! Saige. Saige! Mimi! No! No! Hi. Dad said I could come in for five minutes and see you. They said you had to have an operation. They sure don't try to make this place very cheery. Hmm. I'd wave hello, but I broke my wrist and my leg. I was really scared, Mimi. I know. Me, too. Now, on to something bigger and better. How's the planning for the protest getting on? I don't want to think about art or some dumb protest right now. Don't say that. Your art classes are too important to stop fighting for. Remember? Artists never give up. Do it for me. Promise? Promise me. Good. Oh, good. Now, I think I need to get a little rest right now. Okay. Bye. Hi. Hi. I got your message last night about Mimi. I'm really sorry. Thanks. But I'm sure she's gonna be okay. And she really wants me to do this protest. Well, then let's do it. I hope you don't mind that I invited Dylan to help us plan. Uh, no, of course not. Gabi's gonna help out, too. The more, the merrier, right? So, I came up with an idea when I was visiting Mimi last night. Her hospital room was so boring and drab. Everything was beige, and all I could think was, "How could anyone possibly feel better in this room?" And then I thought, this is what the world would be like without art in it. Boring and totally colorless. So the idea for the protest is, "A Day of Beige," the world without art. That's a great idea! It's totally genius! Thanks. And I'm thinking we can do it next Monday. And have all the students who want to protest wear only beige, no colors. Well, I look terrible in beige. Can't we do "A Day of Pink" or something? I mean, that was kind of the whole point, but... Wait! I have an even better totally genius idea. You do? Listen. A protest is great and all, but who cares if no one knows about it? Everyone at school will know. I'm talking, like, the whole city. How would the whole city find out? Hello! My mom's a reporter for The Post! I don't know if we need to get... Really? That's awesome. I'll bet I can get her to do, like, a press conference or something. We'll get a ton of attention! Now it's like a real protest. Is that okay with you, Saige? Um. Sure. That does sound good. Cool. So I'll talk to my mom right away. She knows so many reporters. Okay, so what we'll have to do is we'll have to tell everybody to wear beige. And then we'll have to talk about why we love music and art so much and why... Rembrandt. Hey, Saige! Wait up! Hey. I saw you from the window walking your dog. What's his name? Rembrandt. And it's more like Rembrandt was walking me. He's been freaking out ever since he came to stay with us after Mimi's fall. It's just like he wants to be home with her. I'm sorry, Saige. It's okay. I just wish she could come see the Day of Beige. Even though Dylan took over the whole thing and made it all about her. Yeah, Dylan's pretty intense. And a press conference? The last thing I want to do is talk in front of a bunch of reporters. Yeah, but it's still a good idea. If Dylan's mom can get us all the publicity, it'll all be worth it, right? Yeah. I guess so. What's wrong? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. We'd better get going. We have a protest to get ready for, right? Right! Come on. Help save the art program. On Monday, wear only beige. Help save the art program. On Monday, wear only beige. Help save the art program. On Monday, wear only beige. Wear beige and protest. Wear beige on Monday. Okay. Almost everyone's wearing beige now. Great! Good morning. What's this? Okay. This is gonna be awesome. Hey. Get rid of the green. Oh. Great. Morning. Come on. Will the following students please report to Principal Laird's office? Saige Copeland, Tessa Jablonsky, Gabi Pea and Dylan Patterson. I'm sure you all know why you're here. Are we in trouble? That depends. I'm hoping you can give me some clarification. Why are reporters calling my office asking me about an after-school press conference? Um. And how does this relate to the fact that the majority of the student body is wearing beige today? I have to admit, the lack of color is a little depressing. So what gives? Would you believe it's the weirdest coincidence ever? Go ahead. You can explain it. Well, um, we kind of meant for it to be depressing. That's right. To show how the world would be without art in it. I guess you could call it a protest. I appreciate your enthusiasm, and I agree with you that art and music are important. But I've fought this battle before, and I don't think a press conference will help. But we have to try, don't we? Artists never give up. The causes most worth fighting for are the ones you're not sure you can win. I just wish you girls had let me know about this in advance. We're really sorry. We should have asked you first. Yes, you should have. And since you didn't, I really should cancel that press conference. But, I have to say, I'm pretty impressed with what you've done. Really? I am. And if... If I let this happen, do you promise never to do anything. Like this again without permission? Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Okay, then you can go ahead with the press conference. Okay! All right, girls! Now, go. Get back to class, all of you. Thank you, Principal Laird. I didn't think so many people would show up. Yeah. Isn't it great? Maybe this protest will really work. Oh, look. My mom's gonna ask the first question. Hi, girls. Pam Patterson from The Post. Can you tell me, what is the nature of this protest? Our protest was about getting art back in school this year. We call it "A Day of Beige"! Incredible! Who came up with this? Saige did. Now, Saige, tell us how you came up with the idea. She asked you a question, Saige. It's okay. It's okay. Saige, do you need a minute? Saige, do you need a minute? For most kids, school is the only place to learn about art and music and dance. What if right now, in school, there's a future Picasso or Taylor Swift, who will never get the chance to shine because they never get to discover their love of the arts? Not to mention, kids who take art get better grades. Now, that's something worthwhile, huh? There you are. Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. Did I ruin the press conference? Not at all. Do you want to talk? No. I just... There were a lot of people there, and they were all looking at me, waiting for me to say something, and I didn't know what to say. Saige! What happened? Where'd you go? Did you hear Dylan? She did a great job. What's wrong? All of you girls did a great job today. I'm gonna do what I can to help. I can't promise anything, but I'll try. Really? Don't be upset. We're gonna get the art program back. Girls, uh, before you get too excited, I called the school board earlier today, and they said there's just no money in the budget for a full-time art teacher. Well, then what about a part-time? Maybe like an after-school thing. You just might have something there, Saige. But we'd still need to fund it ourselves. Like, how much money? My guess would be about $5,000. And we'd need to do it by the second week in October to get it into this year's budget. Wow. Let me just check my piggy bank. Not. How can we find all that money in six weeks? Well, I don't know. But I do know you had quite an artistic vision today. And after pulling that off, I have no doubt you'll find a way. How can we possibly come up with $5,000 in the next six weeks? I mean, my allowance is only $10 a week. How about a fundraiser? I mean, there must be plenty of people in your community who'd support your cause. A fundraiser. That could work. And I know just where to hold it. The Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta. The whole city shows up. That's a great idea, Mimi. The Fiesta's in a few weeks and will give us just enough time to get everything ready. And give you time to get better so you can finish your mural and lead the parade on Picasso. I... I don't think so, Saige. But you always lead the parade. Well, not this time. But you could. You could lead the parade. Every year, all of Albuquerque expects a Copeland to lead the parade. - This year it could be you. - But... You're a great rider. You know Picasso. And it would only take you a few days to learn how to do the parade gait and the scarf trick. But there'll be so many people there watching me. What if I totally freak out? You're used to being in front of an audience. I'm not. If I can't even talk in front of a few people, how can I ride and do those fancy parade moves in front of a huge crowd? I'm sorry, Mimi. There's just no way. Okay. I understand. I know it would make a splash, but the last thing I want to do is ride Picasso in that parade. Well, if you want to make a splash, I think I know how you could do it! No, Dad! No, no, no! Don't! Hi, Rembrandt. Buddy. Are you sure you don't want to ride in the parade? Yeah. But it was weird. Mimi didn't even try to talk me into it. The old Mimi would never have given up so easily. Do you think she'll ever be the same again? Look, I know it's hard to see her like this. But broken bones, they take a long time to heal. She can't ride or paint, all the things that she loves to do most. But she gets out of the hospital tomorrow, and then she's gonna go in some physical therapy. That's gonna help, too. She just needs time. And maybe... Maybe she needs something to look forward to. Something like her granddaughter leading the parade? I never thought about it like that. You really think I could do it? I know you can do it. Think about how much it would mean to Mimi. Okay? Feel good to be home, Mom? Well, it's nice not to be in the hospital. That's for sure. Hey, look at what I got for you at the art store. These are felt-tipped brush pens. The guy at the store said they're super easy to use. So, even though you broke your right hand, you can use them with your left hand. It's almost like they draw for you. That's great, sweetie, but I'm just not up to it right now. Oh. Okay. Maybe tomorrow. Hey, I know something that'll cheer you up. I've decided I'm going to do it. I'm going to ride Picasso in the parade. Really? Oh, that is wonderful, sweetie. Oh. Hey. You really think I can do this? That makes one of us. So, the Balloon Fiesta is in a few weeks, and we're still looking for a really big idea for a fundraiser to do there. But until then, we can still do some smaller fundraisers. We've got $5,000 to raise and not a lot of time. Are you guys ready? Ready! Oh, yeah. Ready. Great! I have a lot of ideas we can do, but tomorrow we'll start with a lemonade stand. A lemonade stand? What are we, five? I'm just saying right now that I don't think we're gonna raise a lot of money from stuff like lemonade stands. Well, I think you're wrong. Told you so. Hmm. Hey, guys. Let's rehearse the show choir number. Don't forget the harmonies in the second verse, everybody! Come on. Let's do this. One, two, three, four. Nothing bigger than the step I'm about to take. Here we go. Start the music, take a breath and fly away. Here we go. Isn't that show choir rehearsing? - They're crazy good. - Uh-huh. From the nearest star. Nobody can stop me. Let the rhythm rock me. All the colors of my heart. Shine. The lights around us. Shine. A magic carpet ride. The moment has arrived. Here we go Oh! Oh! We got a green light so Oh, oh, oh! Doesn't it feel like this is the time we're meant to shine like gold? Here we go Oh, oh, oh. We got a green light so Oh, oh, oh. Doesn't it feel like this is the time we're meant to shine like gold? Here we go. Awesome, guys. Really good rehearsal. Yeah! Thanks! That was so awesome! That was amazing! Hey. Hey. Sorry show choir rehearsals ran over, but... Wasn't that song just beyond? Yeah, I've never heard it before. That's 'cause Dylan just wrote it. Wow. That's cool. So, what's the final total? $83.77. That's not bad, right? Yeah. We only have, what, 4,000 and a few dollars to go? Another bake sale should do it. Well, it's more than we had last week. Do you have any better ideas, Dylan? Uh, yeah, I do. Well, we'd love to hear it. I think we should do a concert at the Balloon Fiesta. I can write the songs. People will love it! But what does that have to do with art? We're trying to save art. And music. Besides, music is so much more exciting. All you can do with art is look at it. We can have dancing and singing. It'll be so awesome! But if you're not into it, maybe you and Gabi should come up with your own art fundraising idea, and Tessa and I can do a concert. You don't think it would be better if we work together? We haven't come up with anything good so far. This way will be easier for us. Right, Tessa? I do think a show would be so cool. I'm sure you and I can come up with something just as cool for art. Don't you think? Fine. We'll split up. Come on. Let's start planning. Are you okay, Saige? Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? Oh, I just thought... Never mind. Let's do this! So, did you figure everything out yet? Come on, Picasso. Come on, boy. Parade gait. Let's go. Parade gait. Come on, Picasso. He senses you're nervous! Come on, boy. He needs to know that you're in control. Come on, Picasso. So let's hear you! Use your voice! Come on, boy. Come on, Picasso. It's never gonna work. Maybe we just need to take a break for today. Try again tomorrow. I'll get some water for Picasso. Okay. Come on, boy. Parade gait. Come on, Picasso. Let's go. Come on, boy. Parade gait. You can do it. That's it, boy! Good boy! - Good boy! - You're doing it! Don't stop. Keep going! Come on, boy. Come... Come on. Whoa. This is a disaster. I'm fine when I'm by myself, but the minute anyone is watching, I get nervous. If I can't even do it in front of you, how can I lead the parade in front of hundreds of people? Do you know what these are? They're horse blinders. Sometimes we put them on Picasso when he needs help focusing. They help the horse focus on the task in front of him by blocking out distractions, like crowds. But they don't make blinders for people, do they? No, they don't. But the mind can be a pretty powerful thing. So next time we practice, I want you to pretend that you're wearing blinders, just like Picasso. I think it'll help to block out all the other distractions. What do you think? I think I'm ready to try anything. And then we're all gonna have this confetti and stuff, and make sure you don't get it in your eyes. So, I talked to like 50 kids, and almost everyone in school is helping out Dylan and Tessa with their fundraiser. We need a killer fundraising idea for art to get more people on our side. Want to come over to my house and try to figure it out? Well, um, I'm supposed to go to Mimi's. I can meet you there. Um. Or not. No, no. That's totally fine. We'll meet at Mimi's. Are you sure? Positive. Okay. Great! And then all of the guys are gonna get on the right side. And then me and her... You're doing so great, Mimi. You're so close. I got you. Okay. Okay. We got you. You're okay. I'm done for the day. But you're doing great. You can't just give up. Your granddaughter's right. Let's work through it and try again. - It hurts. - I know. But you need to try to work through the pain. It's the only way you're gonna bounce back. See, the muscles in your legs, they need to be retrained... I said no! Look, I'm sorry. I just... I need to rest. Okay, Mimi. I understand. Let's try again tomorrow, okay? I'll just get my things. - Bye. - Bye. Bye-bye. I'll be out back riding Picasso. How's it going? Um... It's going great. Just you wait till you see me in the parade. You'll be amazed. That's wonderful. Bye. Bye. Okay, Picasso. It's time you and I had a little talk. I just told Mimi things were going really well between you and me. And I don't want that to be a lie. There are going to be a lot of people at the parade, and that scares me. So we need to work together. You need to help me out with my blinders, okay? Good boy, Picasso. Good talk. Ready to try the gait? Remember, blinders, okay? Remember our talk? It's just Luis. We can do this in front of him, right? Ready. Come on, boy. Come on, Picasso. We can do this. Come on, boy. Come on, boy. Yes! That's what I'm talking about. I knew you could do it! Good boy. We got it! Yeah! Yeah! Whoa. Good job, boy. I knew you could do it. Way to go. All it took was thinking about having blinders on, and a little talk. Never mind. So next time, the scarves? Can't hurt to try, right? Mimi's such an incredible artist. Yeah. She was painting that for the Fiesta. She'll be back soon. Who wouldn't want to paint in this place? I've never seen such an awesome studio. I would kill to draw on this paper. It's primo stuff. My cartoons would look so cool on it. Uh-huh. And these brushes. This has got to be natural hair. I've only used the fake stuff. And the acrylics! Okay, Gabi. I get it. Mimi has some pretty cool stuff. Sorry. I was just trying to... No. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have freaked out like that. I just don't bring friends here very often. I mean, this is a special place for me and Mimi. The only other person who's been here is Tessa. And now you. I'm glad you're here. Me, too. Rembrandt! Oh, no. Dog hair and paint do not mix. I'm gonna have to start all over. Actually, I think it looks kind of neat. It is kind of cool. I could use the dog hair to add texture. Ooh, that's awesome! It is, isn't it? I've got an idea. So, I was painting in Mimi's studio and... Some pieces of Rembrandt's hair got stuck in the paint. - So then I thought... - So then she thought... Jinx! You tell it. - No, sorry, you. - I'm just so excited. As much as I'm enjoying story time, maybe you could get to the point? Yeah, seriously. Some of us have music class to get to. So, the dog hair? Um. Right. So instead of trying to separate the dog hair from the paint, I just went with it. And then I realized that when I combined the two, it made my art look better. Sounds like a cool picture. But what does this have to do with the fundraiser? I think we should put art and music together in a big show. We can invite other students to help us. Dancers, the orchestra. But how do you use art in a show? That doesn't even make any sense. I'm not sure yet. But we've had good ideas before. Look at the Day of Beige. We've spent a lot of time on our music-only idea. Are we supposed to just scrap our whole thing because some dog hair got stuck in your painting? Dylan, maybe there's a way to combine all the stuff you've been working on. But we wrote a song, and we've gotten a bunch of the choir kids involved. But when we add the art stuff, it'll be even better. Listen! Tessa and I already have the music thing covered. You and Gabi should just stick with doing your own art fundraiser. Tessa? I think that maybe Dylan has a point. Really? It's just that everyone in choir has been working really hard on our song. So you're just gonna go along with whatever Dylan says. I'm not just going along with Dylan. I agree with her, okay? The old Tessa would've listened to what I had to say. "The old Tessa"? What's that supposed to mean? I mean that since you and Dylan have been hanging out, you're different. Uh-huh, well, I could say the same for you and Gabi. Let's go, Tessa. I am so sick of you! What are you talking about? Oh, like you don't know. You take over everything! You think you're so funny and the greatest person ever. But, really, you're just totally annoying! And I'm not the only one that thinks so! Stop it! Right now! You say I'm acting different? Well, you know what? The old Saige would never talk to someone like that. Come on, Dylan. We've got to get to rehearsal. Tessa, wait. Well, that didn't go as planned. Oh, you're early. I wasn't expecting you for another half-hour. I needed some extra Mimi time. You okay? Not really. Want to talk about it? No. I just want to forget about today by painting with you. I got the brush pens I brought you. I saw you hadn't opened them yet. Hon, that's sweet of you, but... No buts, Mimi. So it's a little different from what you're used to. Remember what you told me? "Change is hard, but we shouldn't let it scare us." Saige, you don't understand. I have to accept that there are some things I just can't do anymore. I get that you can't ride in the parade, but your art? When you come see me ride in the parade, I know that it'll make you feel better. You are coming, aren't you? Saige, I... I just don't know if I'm really up to it. But you're getting better. You have to get better. You have to paint again. Honey, I don't... I don't think I'll be able to. But you have to try. Do you know how hard I've been working? Trying to raise money, practicing riding Picasso. I know I told you it was going well, but it's not. And I'm scared to ride in front of all those people, and I can't do the scarf trick. I know you're scared, too, but you can't give up! - Saige, please. - No! The Mimi I know would never give up. Now that you've gotten the parade gait, ready to try the scarves? Uh-huh. You sure? You seem a little preoccupied. I'm fine. Well, then let's see what you got. Hey, honey. We came to see our great horsewoman. Looking good, sweetie. Try the scarves, Saige. Come on. Find your balance. You can do it! Come on, Saige. Stay focused. Don't let anyone distract you. Try to stand up straight. Come on, Saige. Don't give up. Pull the scarves. Come on. Keep going! Pull the scarves, Saige. Whoa, whoa, whoa... I can't do it with everyone watching me! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy, Picasso. Take it easy. Good boy. Come on. I got you. You're okay. Come on, Picasso. Good. The Balloon Fiesta's gonna be a complete and total bust. I can't think of any more fundraising ideas. I can't ride Picasso in front of people. I can't do anything. Saige, it's going to be okay. No, it's not. I just wish everything would go back to normal, when we had art class in school, and Mimi was, well, Mimi, and Tessa was still my friend. I want things to be the way they were last year. You know what? I think I'd better get home. Gabi, don't go! Saige, it's going to be okay. No! Saige! So, what do you think? I think it's amazing. Well, just think, in a few weeks Tessa, you and I will be up here in your balloon at the Fiesta. I'm not so sure about Tessa. Why? What happened? Dad, it's just... Things have been so weird lately. I just don't understand why everything has to change. Yeah, well, change can be scary. It's easier to stay with what we're used to. But staying with the same old thing would get pretty boring after a while, right? Being friends with Tessa was never boring. Neither was Mimi before she got hurt. Of course not. That's not what I meant. Look, you're right. Change can be really, really hard. But you know, sometimes change can be good. You know how I plot my course before I go up in the balloon? You mean how you try to plot your course. You never end up going where you planned. Ouch. That's cold. But it's true. And that's because I can't plot where the wind will blow. I have to let it take me where it wants to go. And you know, a lot of times, I end up someplace way, way cooler than I had ever, ever expected. The wind has literally pushed me in new directions. Some people, they prefer to stay on the ground. That way, they can always tell where they're going. But me? I'll take my chances with the wind, up here in the clouds, any day. But what about Mimi? Mimi will always be Mimi. Even if she doesn't end up exactly the way that she used to be. She just needs to know that... Well, she needs to know that you'll love her. You'll accept her, no matter what. You understand, sweetie? Okay then. Now what do you say we see where the wind takes us? Gabi, wait. Hey. I'm... I'm sorry you had to see me freak out like that at Mimi's. I'm not the best when it comes to changing all the time. I really hope you forgive me. It's okay. I get it. Moving to a new school is a big thing for me, too. It's been hard to get used to. Well, it seems like you're dealing with change way better than I am. I'm happy you moved here. Me, too. Come on. Race you to class. Hi, Mimi. Hello. I'm sorry about what I said the other day. I shouldn't have gotten mad like that. I get that you need to do things in your own time. And whatever you need, I'll always be here for you. I love you. I love you, too. And even though you can't actually be at the parade with me, you'll still be with me. You know what I mean? I know exactly what you mean. You gotta keep your arms straight, Saige. The scarves keep getting tangled. We've been out here for a long time. We can try again tomorrow. No. I have to keep trying. Wow. I think that's the best thing you've ever painted. You're really talented. Thanks. I hope it's okay that I came by. I know you used to like it when I'd come hang out while you painted. But now... Look, you were right about the idea for the fundraiser. I was? I was in choir today, and I got so caught up with the new harmonies we learned. And then I started thinking how awful it would be if I didn't have music class anymore. And I realized I'd be feeling just like you're feeling about not having art. It doesn't feel good. I know it doesn't. We should work together. Really? But what about Dylan? I'm sorry I didn't think about how that would make you feel if I started hanging out with Dylan more. I guess I just didn't realize what that would be like until I saw you and Gabi finishing each other's sentences. I got... I got jealous. You did? Yeah. I mean, you and I are supposed to do that. And I should have told you how I felt instead of exploding the way I did. I'm sorry, too. Thanks. So, are you still mad at me? How could I stay mad at you? Now the only thing left for me to worry about is the fundraiser. And the $5,000. Yeah, speaking of that. Dylan messed it all up. She went so hard core that pretty much everyone dropped out. - No way. - Yeah. That's why it's even more important that we work together. That sounds great. But without an idea for a fundraiser, there's nothing to work on. - Is that Mimi's? - Yeah. She was painting it for the Fiesta. - Well, it's even better than last year's. - Yeah. But she didn't get to finish it before her fall. So now not only Mimi will miss the Fiesta, but so will her painting. Wait. I've got an idea. Hey, guys. How's it going? It's going amazing. - Let me hear some. - Okay. Love it! Keep up the good work, guys. Right. Okay. See you. - See you. - From the top? Hey. Do you want to help? Really? You want me to help? Sure. We haven't got a lot of time, and you already know parts of the dance. I know everyone's mad at me right now. Guess I can't blame them. Look, I'm sorry for trying to take over everything. I just get excited and want to make sure I get to be included in things. And then, when I get nervous, I try to cover it up by making jokes. Wait. You get nervous? Of course. Especially around you. Me? Why? Because I know you and Tessa have this epic friendship thing. That made me jealous. But I was jealous of you. I'm really sorry I blew up at you. And I should have told you how I felt instead of complaining behind your back. I could probably learn a few things about speaking up from you. Oh, I can so help you in that department. For sure. Thanks. Why don't you go over and have Tessa teach you the new song? Come on. Okay. So what are we doing here? We're learning a song. - Yeah. - So... The 16th Annual Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta would like to welcome balloonists from around the globe. Come and see the skies filled with brilliant color. We can do this, right? It's just like doing it in Mimi's corral in front of Tessa and Gabi, times 100. - There she is. - Oh, yeah. There she is. You're here. I couldn't miss the debut of my granddaughter. You're walking. I wanted to surprise you. Luis made me this beautiful cane. Or as I prefer to call it, my fancy walking stick. I couldn't just leave it gathering dust in my living room. I'm so glad you're here. But I'm also really nervous. There are a lot of people here. What if I freak out again? And I don't think I'll be able to do the scarf trick. Hon, just being here is an accomplishment. If you don't do the scarf trick, who cares? You've already succeeded in my book. Thanks, Mimi. No. I'm the one who needs to thank you. For what? For this. They're incredible. I've never seen you draw like this before. You inspired me, Saige. You're my muse. I am? You reminded me that there's... There's still a lot of fight left in me. Thanks to you. Welcome, one and all, to the 16th Annual Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta. - This is so exciting. - I know! As you all may have heard, our usual grand marshal, the internationally renowned artist, Mimi Copeland, has taken a tumble and will not be able to start the parade. But taking her place will be her granddaughter, Saige Copeland! Go, Saige! Whoo! You hear that, Picasso? It's almost time. So without further ado, I give you the Fiesta de Albuquerque Parade! Ready or not, Picasso, here we go. There she is. Here she comes. You got it, Saige! Come on, Saige. Blinders. Blinders. Blinders. Blinders. Blinders. Blinders. Blinders. That's it. Whoo! Fantastic! Whoo-hoo! That's my girl! Go, Saige! Blinders. Blinders. Blinders. Whoa! - What's going on? - I don't know. You could lead the parade. There will be so many people there. Well, I was nervous the first time I performed in front of a crowd. What if I totally freak out? Come on, Saige. Stay focused. Sometimes the causes most worth fighting for are the ones you're not sure you can win. I can't do it with everyone watching me! Stay focused. Don't let anyone distract you! I can't ride Picasso in front of people. You're in control! The Balloon Fiesta's gonna be a complete and total bust! All artists have a voice. Let's hear you! Use your voice! - I can't do anything! - You're in control. You could lead the parade. You really think I could do it? Of course you can. Artists never give up. Come on, Picasso. Let's go. That's my girl. Oh, my gosh! That's it! Whoo! That's my girl. That's it! Ladies and gentlemen, we invite you to the Kimo Theatre for a special fundraiser, supporting art and music programs at Mesa Grande Elementary School. Good afternoon, Albuquerque! Okay, okay. I know you're excited, and frankly, so am I. As you all may know, we're trying to raise $5,000 to pay for an after-school art program. Participation in the arts has countless benefits for students. It increases verbal and math skills as well as critical thinking, and gives kids a confidence boost. We've already raised close to $2,000, but we've still got $3,000 more to go. So get out your checkbooks, people. And enjoy the performance. And now, I give you Living Art. Artists live to create. And experiencing their art makes us feel alive. It's my painting. But tonight, let us bring art to life for you. Wow. The time is here. Gotta face your fears. When it seems like the sky is falling down. You stand up tall. You give it all. The moment of truth just might be now. Today is getting brighter. All because you opened up your eyes. What happens next? You take a step. Get ready to fly. You're only one voice. But over the noise just let your song be heard. A dream that's all yours becomes so much more. Becomes an extraordinary world. It's all right to dance for your life. To place this feeling first. Go. There's only one you. Your colors shine through. To paint an extraordinary world. Wait. Not yet. Now. Thanks. Get ready, get ready. Get ready, get ready. Get ready, get ready. Get ready to fly. You're only one voice. But over the noise just let your song be heard. Let your song be heard. A dream that's all yours becomes so much more. Becomes an extraordinary world. It's all right It's all right. To dance for your life It's your life. To place this feeling first. There's only one you. Your colors shine through. To paint an extraordinary world. Bravo! Saige! No. No. Come on, Saige. Take a bow. - No! - They want to see you. Saige! Come on. Thank you, everyone! And now, I have the final fundraising tally. Today's donations have given us a grand total of... Please, please, please. Well, here we go. $3,992. So close. Well, a valiant and close effort. So on behalf of Mesa Grande Elementary, I'd like to thank you all for coming today... Wait. Do you mind if I say something? Of course not. Um. Um. Hi. I'm Saige Copeland, and speaking in front of all of you is pretty much my greatest nightmare come to life. But I learned a lot about facing my fears today. And now I'd have to say my greatest nightmare would be not having art or dance or music in school. Art is everything to me. It's the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing I think about before I fall asleep. And there are a lot of kids who feel like I do. Art makes us feel good about ourselves. It's a way to show the world, you guys, who we are. It gives us a voice. Gives me a voice. So please, please, help us bring this program back to life. Thank you. You were awesome! Thanks. That was so good. I can't believe I did it. I'm so proud of you. One second. Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's my girl. Awesome. Well, I think you just found your voice. I guess I did. Thank you. For everything. I'm happy to announce that today's donations have let us hit the $5,000 mark! Mesa Grande Elementary will have an art program this year! Look, my design! Wow! Amazing. It's incredible! Totally beyond beyond! I'm so glad I didn't miss it. Me, too. Come on. Hey, Dad. Hey. Come on in. Come on. Whoa. This is so beautiful. - Is it gonna be scary? - Look at that pink one right there! Oh, man. - You guys ready to go? - Yeah! Let's do this. Here we go. Whoa! Wow, so cool! Whoa, look! Look at those people! They look like ants! Whoa, look! Whoa! Look over here!
