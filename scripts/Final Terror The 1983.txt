Here, let me help you up. Shit! Put your arm around me. Over there. I'll find help. Hello? Hello? Shit. Jimmy? Jim! Jimmy? Jimmy! Jim? Filth! Don't you know better? Filth! Wake up pigs! Eggar, what the hell you doing in here? Morning Eggar, up to your old tricks? - Hey Zorich! - Get the hell out of here! - Wake up! - You goddamn geek. - Who you calling geek, boy? - You wanna mess with me? You want to dance? Hey, cupcake. You better find someone to take care of you. I don't need anybody to take care of me. Go on, get out of here! You heard him Eggar. 10 number 10 cans is missing from my store room. You got to sign. I'm not coming up short in my pantry. Now, you make sure those boys behave themselves, you hear? There. Mike, this is crazy. Why in the hell are you bringing us along? Man, this whole thing is bullshit. It's just for my man to get off with his lady, huh? See the kind of gratitude I get? I go out of my way, I go out on a limb, to set it up so these guys can have a little holiday. - Well, how many girls are coming along? - 3, plus my girlfriend. Yeah, but what do they look like? Listen. These are very classy ladies. I want you guys to try to be gentlemen. Be polite and try to be cool. - Well, you know us. - That's exactly what I mean. Why's Eggar coming? Coming along so he can pick us up on Friday when we get off the river. You better keep him away from us before he gets his ass kicked. He's already starting on Cerone. Okay. I'm going to talk to him. Why don't you guys come along and help him load the bus. Oh, and Dennis? Wear some underwear. A forestry worker and a female companion are missing in the North Mill Creek vicinity. - Authorities are continuing the search. - Eggar! The weather will continue fair through tomorrow... - Eggar! - Over here. Hey, what's going on man? I just got orders, a change in plans. You're going to go to Mill Creek instead of Wolf Creek. That's 30 miles further than where we're supposed to go. Mill Creek's real dangerous. You don't want to take these kids out over there. Somebody might get hurt. What the hell is the matter with you Eggar? I thought we understood each other. Now, the bus was supposed to be ready to go an hour ago. The bus was ready to go an hour ago. I do your job for you, didn't I? I had to wake your baby punks out of bed! And you're using a state vehicle for personal business and you're transporting outsiders. Now, I know who you're taking. And I know what you're going to do with her too. This is still a work detail. I've got all the authorization I need! You let that garbage do what they want instead of teaching them right from wrong! Listen Eggar, let's get something straight. I'll take care of my job and you take care of yours. Mine is to plan the work details and yours it to get me there. What the hell you think they're gonna do out there in the woods with girls? Pray? Let's see what we got here. Come on, cool it! - Oh, man. - Morning, sir! Mama looks good. Thank you. It's a really nice house you have here, Mr. Morgan. - We had a little automotive difficulties. - I understand. These are my boys from the camp. Do you believe all this shit? Bye dear. - Bye mom, bye daddy. - Bye dear. - What about that missing couple? - They'll be okay, there's 3 adults. Got more rafts than the Navy. - Leave her alone. - You can come sit over here with me. - Oh shit. - Okay, get on, all right. We're going to take real good care of your daughters here, don't you worry about anything. 3 blind mice, 3 blind mice. 3 blind mice, 3 blind mice. - They all ran after the farmer's wife. - 3 blind mice, 3 blind mice. 3 blind mice, 3 blind mice! - Hallelujah! - 3 blind mice, 3 blind mice. Oh, yeah! Did you ever see such a sight in your life? 3 blind mice! 3 blind mice! See how they run! - The bus will take us to this point, here. - That'll be the work site. - This is where we're going to work, yeah. - Where is the work site? Right there. We're going to go to the stream for fish and game. Ain't that where you took us before? That's a long way in there. Yeah, it's about 30 miles deeper in. Yeah, we're going to hike about 15 miles down to a place called Mill Creek. And then the rafts will meet us there at the forestry outpost. How do the rafts get there? Oh, well Eggar will take them. Yeah, he'll meet us there with the bus. Then we're going to raft about 30 miles down to a place that, Mike, - what's the name of that place you told me about? - Happy Camp. - What kind of bear they got up there? - Big. - You mean you girls gonna work for us? - Sure! Does anyone really know the way? Hey Mel, are there any deer there? Look, all I can tell you is it's wild, it's practically untouched and you're going to love it. It's really beautiful, you're just going to love it. Ain't no reason to be there. Trails don't need no clearing and the streams ain't no good. Lot of wild animals. You girls ain't never been up there. You going to have a lot of trouble with these dried out trees. They keep... logs keep falling down, branches and stuff. Couple friends of mine got hurt up there a couple years ago, one man was killed. I know a stretch a patch about 30 miles north of here that would be a lot easier for y'all to get through. It got a lot of nice streaming up there and y'all have a better time doing it that way and nobody get hurt. If I do get you up there, y'all going to be bitching and moaning about how dark it is and how rough it is. Come 12 o'clock, midnight, - I won't be there to help y'all. - Why don't you just drive the bus all right? I'm just warning you. Somebody's going to get hurt, you do that. - I'm going to tell them Eggar. - Shut up back there! - I'm going to tell them all about you. - You hear me Zorich? I ain't going to take your shit no more! You hear me? Hey Eggar, isn't that your old home? You know what that is Windy? A mental institution. - Don't put that there. - Where's your gloves, goddammit? - Come on. - Boone, wear your gloves next time! Shit. You'll be much more comfortable if you wear them, darling. Here. You do that on purpose? It ain't funny, goddammit! That's how people get hurt! - Hey, Eggar! - Leave me alone. - Shit. - Hey, Eggar! - Come on Eggar! - Cut your shit out, out here! Eggar! Oh, it's beautiful! Hey, simple! Boats stay on the bus. How you supposed to get downstream? Now come on, get down there. We got a stream to clear. Let's go, let's go. Pick up that box. Hey! What you doing? Just go on, I'll take care of that. Get that out of here. Go ahead! - Okay man, why don't you get off my back? - You keep walking. - You just keep walking. - Fool. Gold, gold! It's real? Hardly. Hey, city boy. Hey, Mike! Why don't you give these guys a break? Hey, you guys, take a break. Take 5. So, tell me. How much dope they grow around here? Come on, give me a break! I bet you guys got plenty of stuff growing around here. What, you think the mad Romanian's going to turn you guys in? Hey, you Romanian jerk. You start messing with somebody else's crop you're going to get your ass blown away. You think that's funny? We got too close once, one of them hippie guys came out with an M16. Hey city boy. Want to try some knuckle brew? - How about some of my stash? - Naw, give it to Eggar. - Well, I ain't got no brain cells. - He can't get high. You little peckers keep up that horse shit and I'm going to strand your butts out there. I remember a wise ass butt just like you, Zorich. And he was pestering like y'all been doing. One night I took him. Way up there in the hills. And I tied him down so nobody could find him. Because I about had it with his horse shit. And I left him there. And ain't nobody ever found him since. Y'all hear me now? You all hear me now? I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Don't ever come back! Don't ever come back! Oh, Mike, they told me that one in kindergarten. Okay, Boone. It's your turn. - Come on, your turn. - Oh, come on Rich! Tell it, go on man. Go ahead. - You don't have to be bashful. - Come on, Boone. I'll get the wood. Okay. So once upon a time, not too long ago, this used to be a logging camp, right here. There was this little sweet 14 year old girl who lived here with a big family. And her father died. So her uncle came to take care of the place. And he was a lumberjack. And he was a mean son of a bitch. Mean, boy. And one night this uncle said, "Hey Susie Q, you want to go for a little walk in the woods?" So he took her on one of these trails, here. Way far out, you know, like we are. And he raped her. She screamed but nobody could hear her. She had to keep all this inside after the rape. Because she couldn't tell anybody because, you know, he was supporting the family. She was afraid to. So she started going crazy. So what they done is, they put her in a mental institution. You know that one we passed on the way down here? And while she's in the hospital they find out that she's pregnant. So she has this little baby boy. But the doctor says, "Well, she's too messed up to take care of the kid". So they take the baby away from her. Okay, so 19 years later... this young kid, just about my age, shows up down there at the hospital. He wants to see this lady. So they let him in. And he goes crazy. I mean he just freaks out. He says, "You can't treat my Mama like this, you can't keep her in this garbage can!" It was her son. He just stole her right out of the place. Just took her. But she was so crazy, you know, that he didn't know what to do with her. So he put her out here in these woods so she could live in peace, you know. But the story goes that whenever anybody camps out around here, she sneaks into your camp... and she whispers to you. She bends down over you, man, you can just smell her breathing on you. You can feel it. And she says, "Who stole my lamb?" "Who stole my..." What the hell you telling stories like that for, boy? What the hell you doing like that? - Scaring these girls half to death! - Eggar, it ain't your turn. You think that's funny? - Eggar! - I ought to cut your tongue out. - You shit! - Hey, Eggar. I want to talk to you. Privately. Don't need to talk about anything. Get your stuff ready. I'm leaving now. Fine. Just be sure you get the boats there when they're supposed to be. Let's get everything on the bus that's going on it. - It's leaving now. - Where's my hat? We'll be rid of him. This guy in my neighborhood made a fortune one week off of some smoke he bought from a farmer up here. We don't buy grass here. We pull it out of the ground. The only reason you're coming is because Boone's hot for that chick. It's about time! What took you so damn long? It's freezing up here! Cerone. - Where the hell is Boone? - He's got lady plans tonight. What the hell you bring him for? I don't know him from Adam. - What do you need to know? - Man, it's what you need to know. Stealing weed ain't like taking candy from a grocery store. Hey, where do you think I come from man? - I don't care where you come from! - Shut up! I deal with this stuff on the streets all the time, man. - Shut up! - I don't know this guy! Nathaniel, how's this? He can be our lookout. We need someone to cover our ass. Remember last time? All right, all right. All right. You cover our ass tonight, you do a good job of it, we'll cut you in for 20 percent. A third. - Kiss my... - Nathaniel, Nathaniel just hold on. 20 percent. - Fuck you. - Hey, wait a minute. Nathaniel, give me 10 minutes with him. I'm relying on you. All right, a third. This is the way we do it. I want you to stay here unless somebody comes. I want you to howl like a wolf every 45 seconds. Wait, I know it sounds crazy. I done it myself before, but it's fool proof. Why don't I howl when I do spot somebody? You mean to tell me, cracker come up to you, stick a M16 up your asshole, you're going to say, "Excuse me, sir, I got to howl like a wolf now?" Use your head. It's when the howling stops that we know someone's coming. Okay. Howl. Like a wolf? A howl? You mean that's all you can do for a third, you can't do better than that? You like that? Good. Now, don't you let up until we get back. - How long am I supposed to do this? - A couple hours. You got to remember. You're special. We never let nobody in for a third before, ever. Hey, Zorich? You're a real generous guy. You just keep howling. - Did he take the bait? - You kidding? Cerone is dumber than I thought he was. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Rise and shine. - No. Yes. - We have to set an example. - What time is it? It's late. Look, you go get the guys and I'll go get the girls. Hey, you guys! Get up! Come on girls! Come on! Let's go, wake up. Come on. Come on girls, let's wake up. Let's go, come on. - Hey, Vanessa. - Stop it! Good heavens Melanie, take it easy. - Come on Windy. - I didn't sleep a wink. Hey, come on you guys, get up. Dennis. Come on, get up man. Hey, Nathaniel, rise and shine. - Rise and shine. - Rise and shine. Rise and shine. - Get up! - Don't! Hey asshole, get up. Looks like Marco Cerone beat all you guys to the latrine. Go bring one of them girls over here. Come on, get up. Breakfast is almost ready. What year is this? Hey, greenie, Windy, come on let's go. Night. I should have slept over there last night. Hey, watch what you're doing you almost hit my foot. Quiet! 1, 2, 3, Marco! You guys didn't hear him around at all this morning? I didn't hear a single thing. Wonder where he wandered off to. You'd think he'd show up for breakfast. Guy's a lone wolf. - Meaning what? - City boy couldn't wait to get in the woods. - Control yourself. - He went on a nature hike. - When? - Last night. He's been out all night? - Well, where'd you leave him? - Out there. Shut up. Why don't we all go home and forget this trip? No, no, no. The first thing we're going to do is you guys are going to show me where you left him. All of you! - He didn't have nothing to do with it. - You two then. Move! Marco! Hey Marco! - Marco! - Marco! Marco! We're not going to be able to get on the river today because of you guys. Marco! Hey, Mike, come on, we didn't mean any harm. Fun's fun, but not all night. Man, they did that to me a million times. They did it to me when I first came. - Marco! - Come on, Mike, it ain't that serious. - Is this it? - Looks different in daylight. Bet you he's back at the camp. Laughing his... butt off. What the hell is that? All right, listen you guys. I want you to go back to camp. Mark the trail on your way. Get Mel. Send her out here to me. You two go downstream, search up. We'll go upstream, we'll search down. Okay, come on. Move! - Yeah, yeah. - Yes, sir! Marco? Mike! Cerone! Marco! Marco! Marco! Come on, let's get shaking. - What you did was really stupid. - It ain't none of your business, lady! Well, unfortunately, we're all on this trip together. You tell your friend's father to buy you better company next time, you understand? - Well, I sure will. - Lighten up, will you man? - Get out of my face, you understand me? - Get up the stream. Get up the goddamn stream! You little shit! Margaret, I think that guy's psychotic. Goddamn Zorich. What are you doing here? - I'm looking for you! - Are you? - You didn't see Marco? - No, you didn't either? No, I saw this, and it looked much better. No. No. Marco! That dude dies because we left him out there it's negligent homicide, man. - Bullshit. - Listen, I know what I'm talking about. Every time I play one of your silly games I get in trouble. Look at that! Check it out. - Use hand signals. - Will you cut the Army crap? This is private property, bud. They might not like your kind. Man, give me a break. I'm going in. Cover me. With what? What's with you, man? Hey! Come here. - It's one of the old camp rafts. - How did it get there? - Think somebody's buried there? - Probably just a dog. Yeah. Zorich? Zorich. Zorich? Zorich. Zoro! - I'm going to kill you! - You wouldn't hurt an old lady, would you? I'm going to kill you! - Hold it, hold it! - What the... Oh, man. What the hell is going on here? Can you tell? Mushrooms? Pure magic. Guaranteed to get you high. Better than acid. Some funky mother's been living around here. Look at all these women's clothes. I don't believe this. - Nathaniel. - What? It's Eggar! You think he's got a woman living here? Ain't no woman living here, he's a goddamn freak! That sucker. I told you he's been stealing from me! Now we're going to get his ass fired! Come on, let's go. Wait a minute. I just want to see what else he's got around. He's sicker than I thought he was. Let's get the hell out of here. I seen a lot of crazy people in my life but this freak takes the cake. You think maybe Cerone slept there last night? Cerone slept there? Man, this cat is sick! Thing is, you just don't know what Eggar's doing up here. Who knows what the hell we're doing up here. Look, all we can do is wait. For Mike and Mel. They know what they're doing, I mean, they're probably all right. They wouldn't have left us up here all night if there wasn't something wrong. This is what we're going to do. First thing, pair up. - Nobody comes or goes alone anymore. - Now you're concerned? You don't know what you're dealing with, lady. Come on! Go keep watch. Wake me up when you get tired. Shit! Dammit! What's the screaming about? What's going on? There's somebody here. There's someone around. I smelled this smell. There was this smell. And there was these hands, these hands in my hair. I swear I'm not dreaming, - I'm not dreaming there's somebody! - It's okay, listen to me. It's okay. - I thought you were on guard. - I was. I heard a noise, Eggar maybe. Fell in the damn creek and sprained my wrist. This all started because you played that stupid prank on Cerone. Light up a joint. Is it dry? Windy, give me the axe. What the hell was that? Who is it? Good evening gentlemen. You turkey. It's Cerone! - Scared the shit out of me. - Hey, Cerone. - Where've you been? - That was great Cerone. Ain't as dumb as you thought, is he Zorich? Anybody want to get high? Do we still get a third? Did you see Mike or Mel out there anywhere? No, they're not around? They're not here because they thought you were lost and went looking for you this morning. - I wasn't lost. I been all over. - Where? Around. Oh, great. We have Romeo and Juliet lost in the woods somewhere. A driver who's an absolute lunatic. A quite unnecessarily broken wrist. I mean, what is wrong with you people? Our trip is a complete disaster and we're playing childish games and stupid juvenile pranks! If you were trying to scare us, you succeeded. Congratulations. Now, perhaps, you'll concentrate on growing up. - Where do you think you're going? - The outhouse, if it's any of your concern. - Not alone you're not. - Don't give me orders! Vanessa, come on! Come on! All right, you're all right, you're all right! Oh, my God, it's Mike. - No! - No! What is it? Oh, don't look, don't look! - We have to find Melanie. - She's right. May be too late but we got to find out. Where I come from, you learn not to mess around with something like this. It's out of our hands. We should get out of here on the road we came in on. 45 miles? That's a two day hike. You try something like that on open road and you're a sitting duck. What do you suggest we do then? I suggest we stay right here. At least for the night. In the morning we'll head down by the river. From there it's only six miles to the ocean. I don't need this bullshit. Tomorrow morning, dawn, we hit that house quick. Maybe if we're lucky we'll find Eggar fast asleep. You better stop that bullshit about revenge Zorich! We don't all want to play your little war game! We don't want to play cowboys and Indians! - We want to get out of here! - Please, please stop it! - Just stop it, stop! - Listen to me. You people want to survive this thing you got to start looking and thinking like the forest. You tie those beads back, you understand? Blondie, you get that hair under a cap. And Boone, get off that white shirt. Eggar! Get your ass out here! Eggar! We coming to get you man! Guys, what's going on in there? God. There any of Mel's things in here? - Oh, my God! - I'm going to kill that bastard. - We can't leave without Melanie. - I'm going to kill him. Come on Windy. Don't stay in here. Windy! Let's get the hell out of here. Let's get down by the river. I'm going to kill him. Let's go! Let's burn this sucker. Burn this whole thing down right now. No! We got to show them what Eggar did here. We stick together, get the hell out of here and let the cops handle it. This one? - Take mine. - Take that one. Make sure you got something warm on. - Hey, I hope you guys realize I can't swim. - Don't worry, sit by me. Keep your eyes open, no more surprises. Even! Watch the edge. Hey, Boone, give me the canteen. Anybody want any water? I'll have some. Melanie! You're dead Eggar! Eggar! Come back Zorich! Dammit! Enough already. Faster goddammit, move it! Come on, come on, come on. We got it, we got it, we got it, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! - Wait! - Easy, jump in. Easy. Here Vanessa. - Okay, let's go. - Get off the raft! - You get out of that boat! - Zorich, don't be hollering at her no more! We got you, we got you. Come on, be cool. - Vanessa! - Relax, relax! - Shit! - Only 3 feet, lady. - Shut up! - I've had enough of you Zorich! - How could he do all this? - I don't know, man. But I know if we can get that thing started we can get our butts out of here. It's a trap. We'll stay here til dark. - Be careful Boone! - Windy be quiet! Come on, Eggar. Come on, Eggar, I know you're on here. Be careful. Stay back. Come on, Eggar, come on out. Come on, Eggar. What you see? He's not here. Come on in. All right, our stuff is still here. Where the hell is he? I know he's here somewhere. Zorich, is there any keys up there? Yeah. No juice. Well we going to start this mother anyway. Come on, let's check under the hood. Check the battery. - The wire's cut. - Here. Marshmallows, chocolate. - Check against the back, there. - I done did, it ain't here. Shit. This bus ain't going nowhere. Eggar took care of that. Then we sure shouldn't stay here. And what we going to do Windy? Go down the river at night? - What we going to do is stay here til sunrise. - Not so bad. There's some dry clothes and there's some food in the cooler back there. - I'll eat anything. - Come on, Windy, light up a joint. - Want an orange? - I'll take a piece of fruit. I told them not to come. - Pull, darn it! - Pull on it! - Get out of the way, I'll kick the door open! - Kick it Marco! Get out the back! Eggar! Eggar! Eggar! Leave them alone! - It's stuck! - Break the goddamn thing! Don't push me! Come on, let's go! I'm stuck! I'm fucking stuck! Come on, Zorich! Where do I go? All right, keep going! Stay together, keep running! - Where we running to? - Just keep going! I don't know, just keep running! I can't see a thing! Come on, lady! Zorich! Zorich, wait up! Zorich? Boone? - Just got to find a way out of here. - Find a way out of here, I'll be fine. Zorich! Margaret! Vanessa? Goddamn it Zorich, why'd you let her out of your sight? Windy! Windy! Windy! Windy! Windy! Windy! It's okay, we're here. It's okay, it's okay. - Where'd he go? - It's okay, we're here, it's okay. I'm going to have to stop the bleeding. I'll need something to sew her up with. Here. And quickly. There's a first aid kit at the bus, we're going to have to go back. I'll go. Hines, you stay with us. Zorich, you go. It's okay Windy, it's okay. It's okay, Windy, it's okay. We're right here. Windy, it's going to be okay. Come on, you guys, hurry please! Come on, let's go! There, there. You're going to be okay. You're going to be okay. It's going to be all right. Come on, just relax. Margaret knows what she's doing. There, hold on, hold on. That's good, that's good, that's good. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. - Doing good. - It's all over, it's all over. Eggar's the enemy. Our job is to kill him. Eggar should die. Zorich. There's too much room up here to trap him. If we get him down in the ravine it'll be nice and close. Cut the song Zorich. Crazy bastard. Easy now, take it easy now. You okay? Y'all watch your step. Zorich, shut up. Okay, this is great. This is where we're going to do it. Great. This is great. Come here! Found something! I'm going to kill him. Right here. This is where it's going to happen. Beautiful. This is beautiful, ain't it? You know something? Throughout all this, I respect him. He's just quiet, waiting. That's the reason we lost the war. You know that, don't you? Well, the VC knew that. They did. - They knew about the forest. - You took them mushrooms, didn't you? We found some magic mushrooms in the shack. He's stoned out his mind. Damn you! - Hey, man, it's a war game! - Then get your act together! Blond hair bitch. You keep off my ass! Zorich, goddammit! We need your help. You're damn right you do. Okay, good Zorich. You do your thing, okay? And we'll do ours. Leave him alone. Come on, let's go. Chump. Goddamn. I ain't stoned. - How you doing? - Okay. Hey, Cerone! Nobody's keeping your ass here! Eggar! Eggar! Eggar! Eggar! Listen to me Eggar! They're going to get you Eggar! They're going to get you bad Eggar! I don't give a damn Eggar! I just want to get out of here! Eggar, I want to help you! Damn you Eggar, show yourself. - Where are you Eggar... - You say too much! I told you not to come! But now you done it. They're going to take her away. They're going to take away. Why'd you come? Why'd you come? Now! Mom! Mom!
