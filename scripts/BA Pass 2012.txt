Are you in a hurry? Do you have an appointment elsewhere? Hello.. - Pammi... Sarika here. l am sending Mukesh to the market to run an errand for me. Hope you don't mind? No...no...not at all! He hardly does anything after returning from college. l've taught him everything so that he does not sit around in the house. ldling his time away. But do make sure he gives you proper accounting!

O Mauritius. You are not going to become any fairer by spending hours under the tap! Fat fuck! Has bath once a year and finishes the whole colony's water supply. Why would l have a bath everyday, pretty boy? l don't run a side business like you. Then maybe you should start running one! Or else you will keep dreaming about going to Mauritius and never actually get there! Stop whining! There is water left for you to wash your ass clean! Johnny bhai. Hey, tuition master! Come meet the headmaster. He is studying to be a doctor of philosophy. Ph.D? Yeah, in chemistry during the day and in biology during the night! Better than you, you slob. Making a living out of scavenging the dead! That's where you are going to end up yourself sooner than you think! lt doesn't take much for the times to change, son. Fuck off! Your entire existence is ill timed. Johnny bhai. l have a small gift for you. Forever indebted to you, my friend! ln the beginning l waited for my husband to get better... Knew that it might never happen, but l had hope... Then eventually, l started waiting for him to die... Years went by... l just kept on waiting... Sometimes hoping that my husband would get better. Sometimes wishing that he would die so that his suffering would end. You have no one close? No immediate family? l have a son, a little elder to you... Lives in Singapore... sends money too. But can't come himself He's got ajob, it's difficult. You go now, the relatives will be arriving any time now. Not much action seems have happened here last night! Her husband passed away... l was trying to call, Why didn't you answer? l was in the hospital, Has switched the ringer off. Come on, then! We have paid the rent, why waste it! What's the matter? l have just left his body at her house! Come l'll drop you home. Don't come home for a few days. Ashok seems to be in a strange mood he has no fixed routine. Comes and goes as he pleases. Are you angry with me? You are not my husband that l need to throw a tantrum to get your attention? Just do as l tell you. l'll let you know when is a good time to come. Just drop me off here, l have some work. That's my friend Johnny. l'll leave now. Why did you make me meet him? He is a friend! Lives nearby. l play chess with him in the cemetery. Have you blabbered anything to him about our work? No! l just told him that you help me get tuitions. Good! Your minds has also sharpened up along with your body. So partner, why did you want to see me? l need a house. Are you looking to buy one? No, want to rent one. So what is the problem?- Nobody wants to give it to a bachelor. And l can't call my sister here until l have a house. Don't worry! Call your sisters! How can l call them till l have a house! Don't worry about that! l have a lady friend too! What family were you talking about? He is a bachelor! Why? l am there! These days even two men can start a family! Stay within your limits, Johnny! Just kidding! He has got two lovely sisters. They will come and stay with him. You can lord over them! They will help you in your housework too! How much is the rent? 3,000 rupees, no security because Johnny has brought you here. But l will take three months advance. My tenants will vacate the room in 15 days. But you need to pay the advance now. His sisters will be here in 15 days. He will give you the advance then and you hand us the keys at the same time. Fair and square, is it not? Look Johnny, my room shouldn't go vacant even for a day. Your house is like my own! l wouldn't be able to bear it. lf you were to incur any loss on my account! May l take one? Get lost! Are you a moron? Rushing to pay the advance when the house isn't even vacant yet! You haven't understood this city at all. Johnny bhai, thank you. Oye! What do you think you are doing? Hey! l am talking to you! That is my drawer. lt was my drawer till you stuffed your things in. Your mother has given me the key. lf my mother gave you the house keys someday.. ..would the house be yours too? l pay my share of the rent every month. You eat worth much more in a single day! l will leave your house... and your drawer as well! Quit talking about it. Why don't you actually do it for a change. l told you not to come here! What was so important? You should not trust me so much! Where else can l keep it? All the banks are asking for an income proof. l will come and take it in a couple of weeks. This bank will charge interest. Biji has woken up. lf you can't knock like a civilized person have the courtesy to look away. Slut! Where the fuck do you think you are going! Sit here! l thought my old mother had gone senile! Then one day l asked myself how long since Sarika nagged you? She seems content! What has changed? l has my eye on you but you sensed it some how! Clever slut that you are... But you couldn't resist for long eh! Today l am going to knock you back to your senses! Oye! Sit! Mother fucker. Watch and learn! Usually you are of no use does seeing me with him turn you on? You pervert! lf you think you are going to fuck around behind my back.. ..and make me look like a fool... then think again. 'l was scared to go back to my aunt's house.' 'l needn't have been for Sarika's husband had already dug my grave.' Mukesh had come home in the afternoon to ask Sarika for a loan. Said that he was not being treated well by you. That you do not give him proper food nor any pocket money. lnspite of our constraints we try to do our best for him... He had been working well up till now so Sarika felt sorry for him. At his age boys tend to mistake sympathy from women for an interest of another kind. Yes, boys at this age can indeed be very foolish. He tried to grab her in front of my old mother. He was smelling of cheap liquor. So, Sarika pushed him away. After that he just went mad. Tried to kiss her.. Caught her arm so hard that he has left marks! Sir, let him return home my husband will take him to a task. Do not let him return is what l came to say. Your husband is due for a promotion it will be very unfortunate.. ..if instead of a promotion he has to sit in front of some anti-corruption inquiry committee. Mukesh... pack your things right away and leave the house! Where will l go, Buaji? l don't care. Go to a friend! Or rent a room! Very independent you have become. You make enough money giving tuitions to get drunk on. Mr. Khanna is lying! l had just gone over to meet Sarika. Everybody is aware of Sarika's reputation. Why her husband is targeting you, l don't know. But if you stay here, you will land all of us in trouble... So for God's sake please spare us. Oye! Tuition master! What happened? And what's with all this luggage? Come with me... Come in. Settle down. Mauritius. My aunt's son lives there... Keeps calling me, says.. ..a little investment can take me far there But l say, l am too old to settle in a new place. Johnny bhai. My money is stuck somewhere. l will rent the room as soon as l get it back. Play chess with me every night. Stay for free as long as you like! When are you coming to get us? l'll be there soon! Why? Has something happened? No, but just come and get us fast. l'll be there don't worry! Hello, Kavita ma'am... Mukesh here. Who Mukesh? There is no Kavita here... Don't call back again. Hello, Reena ma'am. This is Mukesh here. You haven't called last few days so l thought l should call and inquire. Wrong number. Mrs. Kajal? This is Mukesh calling. Usha ma'am. This is Mukesh calling.

Somebody's got the wrong address. What are you doing here? Leave! My husband can come anytime! Did he hit you? What else do you expect? A trophy? My sisters are coming, l need my money. Are you done? They rescheduled my appointment for tomorrow. Breakfast! Johnny bhai, l need a favour? What? You will have to go to that lady's house the one that you met with me. Why don't you go yourself? My aunt lives in the same colony if she sees me there... What work do you have with her? Sleeping through the day begets bad luck my friend! She says that your due has already been paid to you. Your lady friend didn't even let me enter the house! She started shouting and threatening me saying that she will call her husband! They have given your number to the cops even filed a report against you... What the hell are you upto? You will get me into trouble as well Screwed up my work. Got me thrown out of the house. And now she says she will not pay me! Bitch! Does she think l am scared of her and her husband! What does she think of herself? Calm down! Shut up and listen to me! What the fuck do you think you are doing! Come to your senses! Have you lost it! l don't know what kind of tuitions you have been giving. But learn this from me. Take out your sim card! Stay away from them they are rich and connected! They will get you busted so bad you won't know what hit you! Give me the sim card l will throw it away. lf you throw my sim card then how will my sisters call me? Give them my number! And what if someone calls you? - Have you ever heard my phone ring? Use my card and give them this number. l am not going to let her get away with this! l will cut her to pieces! Don't talk shit. We are out of booze as well! Come... Come on... This godforsaken town is a real shit hole! You place your trust in people thinking they are your friends. But the moment you turn around they ram it right up your ass. l'll go give this number to my sisters. Ok, but now don't go stressing them out as well. Hello, Sonu! Are you alright? Who's number is this? lt's a friend's number, save it on your phone. What's this noise are you outside? What are you doing out so late? - We have run away from there... We are on our way to Delhi.

Here, gulp it down. Johnny bhai. Could you lend me some money? l will return it soon. Money? lf l had any money saved do you think l would have been stuck in this city. l would have gone away to Mauritius long back! l live off the dead! l bury one corpse to get one meal! l am surviving because people die in this city everyday. l would have run away long time back. To Mauritius... to white sands... to blue skies... You are young you will get many chances. Brother. Stop for a minute... You are with me because this is your first night. From tomorrow you are on your own. Be tough! Don't be scared! Do we wait here? l'll go first. How much money should l ask for? 2,000 rupees don't settle for less. Drink up! Go on, have another swig. lt eases the pain! Move aside. Time to get to work! Looking for fun? - Yes! How much will you pay? - Let's bargain on the way. There is one! Standing all by himself! Back up. l am tired of whores around here let's try the pretty boys for size! Three of you? Why, you gonna cook for us tonight? All three of you will have to pay!
