No. Don't nag! - I'll do it when I have time. - Just hang up the shower curtain. - Why don't you do it? - Because you said you would. Can I have my phone? Did you take my phone? Can I have it? - Give me my phone! - Kjetil, did you take David's phone? - Give it to me! - Give it back. - Whatever... - Kjetil, don't do that again. He's asleep, David. I mean it! If you bring some girl to a party that I think is hot... The point is: Never dis your friend. OK... - I shouldn't have to tell you this. - I'm just trying to get your point. Even if she's not your girlfriend and you're not interested in her... - I brought her to the party. - But just as a friend. I'd still have to wait until the next time I met her, to fool around? Christ! Pay attention! You're not listening to me! - Hi there. Hi, Balder! - Jarle's waiting for you. Hi, Balder! Hey, boy! - Say hi to Morten. - No! Get that dog out of here! - What are you doing? - Bye. You coming? Fucking dog! Why'd you do that? Hey! You were almost on time today. Hey. Everything in the car needs to be taken inside. Hiya. Happy birthday. What's that? Lars? You walking around with a piece now? - What's your problem? - Why bring it to the gym? Stay out of my business. - This is my job! - I have every right to be here. - I know what I'm doing. - I don't think so! - What's your problem? - You are! You sell steroids and bring a damn piece to my job! - Don't get excited. - Shut your mouth. - Your Paki friends are here. - Listen, David... What's going on here? Huh? - Anything else I should know about? - No. I see two smart people and an idiot in here. And the idiot is my son. Don't you have a job to do? Check him out. - And he wants to become a cop. - He hasn't applied yet. - Yes, he has. - Who told you that? - He told me himself. - I'm so tired of this shit. - Give me a hand? - No way. - I'm going to work in a few hours. - You're unbelievable! What an asshole! What the...? - I warned you. - Looking for a beating? Lars! Don't do this. - Leave it. - What are you doing? - He's the one acting up. - Walk away! We're twice as many as you. Leave before something happens. Hi! - Is Morten here? - I think they're on their way. - Where are you? - Where are you? - Are you nearby? - Do you have a key? - What? - Are you talking to me? - You've got the worst echo... - Where are you? I'm on my way. Hello? - What a nag! - Where have you been? It's Lars. He never showed up for that deal. Salima! Were you going to walk right in? Wait out here. Hello? Lars? - I want to fuck Khuram's sister. - She's so young. - Think he'd find out? - He doesn't even let her outside. - You think he would find out? - He'd kill you. David? Got a second? - How much are we talking? - 50,000. - So you spent 50,000? - I didn't spend all of it. - Is the money here? - No. - Is the stuff here? - Not all of it. - You sold stuff you didn't have? - I can give him Deca. No, he needs Omnadren. You can't bail out on a deal and hide in your room. - Give Khuram his money or his stuff. - He can get it later. When I get the rest from Stefan. On Wednesday. How much is that worth? If I give that to Khuram, you owe him for 40 grand? And you'll have that on Wednesday? Yeah... David, you don't have to do that. Then what am I doing here? - Hi. - Can we talk? It's only 10 grand worth. You'll get the rest on Wednesday. - I ordered for 50. - He doesn't have the rest yet. Don't look at me. I've got nothing to do with it. OK? You're leaving. He's waiting for you. Watch your step. - Nice cake. - Thank you. OK... Everybody ready? Happy birthday to you... - Turn it off. We're watching a film. - It's a DVD. We're watching a film. A movie, right? You turn off your mobile at movie theaters, not at home. I won't dignify this with a discussion. Hello? I need some air. Then I'll go to work to tell them I won't be coming in. Fuck... David! I don't have time for this. - Have a seat. - Hey... - What's going on? - Direct all your questions at me. We found cash and steroids. Know anything about that? Fine! If no one owns up, we'll all take a trip down to HQ. - And nobody wants that. - I'm not going anywhere with you. I just found a gun. I can't stay here. Do you understand? Thank you. - I need to get to the hospital. - And I have places to be. - I won't rat. - Then we'll go back down. - My dad is sick! - Just tell me whose this is. I don't have anything to do with that! - Whose is it? - I don't know! Then we'll go back downstairs. - I need to get out of here! - Then tell me whose that is. - My father is dying. - Stop wasting my time! You keep repeating yourself! I'm tired of it! - Just give me a name. - If I squeal I'm doomed! Is that clear?! - Is that clear? - Yes. I'm sorry. Why were the police here? Do you want to talk about dad? David... - Go up to mom, Kjetil. - Mom's not there. Wait here, Kjetil. Just wait here. Hi... Is Morten here? Morten? Come here. - Sorry. - Don't apologize to me. - Is Lars or Jarle here? - Lars is in custody. - What were you thinking? - Jarle, listen to me. Jarle, listen... Listen to me, Jarle. Just let me explain. Morten, I need to talk to you! I want to go home. Hi... Morten... Wait here, Kjetil. OK? Morten? Morten, listen to me. - I couldn't sit there any longer. - None of us wanted to sit there! Morten! Go away! I've been thinking about going back to work. And I was hoping... I'll only be taking a few shifts. But I thought... I can't bring Kjetil to work with me. If you could work a little less, that would give me more time. Could you stay with Kjetil some days? No. You have to go to the funeral home tomorrow. I'll leave you the address. Come in here and we'll talk. Too many people out there. - I don't want any trouble. - Fine, I'll just listen to you. I just want to explain, so that you can understand. You know dad has had cancer, and all that, right? While we were being held at the station... I lost my dad that day, Jarle. What good does that do Lars? I feel bad for you, but this isn't about you. It's about my son. You ruined his life, David. He had one goal in life: To become a cop. I don't give a shit about whether he could have made it. He may have been too stupid to see that himself. But you ruined the only goal he had. That's what I have to relate to. Hi. - Can't we go upstairs? - I'm just having a chat with David. I'll be up in a minute. I can't sit here and have an opinion about flowers, - - or what instruments I want at my father's funeral. I'm sorry. This is Morten. Leave a message, and I'll call back. Mom? Where are you guys? David... Why did you call us? There are a lot of things I need to get done. I can watch Kjetil, if you still want me to. What about your job? I can't help you, if you don't say anything. - It's nothing you can help me with. - Mom! Coming! - You're cheating again. - No, I'm not. I'm watching you cheating! - It's your turn. - No, it isn't. Lift up your pillow. I won't play with you if you cheat. I need a word with you, David. - About what? - Let's talk in the car. Ali, shut that dog up! - What's going on? - Move your head! I can't see. - Your beef is with Lars or Jarle. - No, it isn't. - I'm getting my money from you. - I don't owe you. I don't have anything to do with this. - You need to talk to Lars. - I was told to deal with you. I either want the stuff, or the money. Today. I don't have anything to do with that. - You said Wednesday. That's today. - Lars said Wednesday! - You said Wednesday! - Listen to me, Khuram! You gave me too little. So you have a problem. Do you understand? I want that money today! - I want it today! - OK! Let go! Let go... Today! Kjetil? Kjetil? Kjetil... Want me to sit here with you? I want daddy to come home. Kjetil, where are you going? Kjetil, you're supposed to sleep. Kjetil? - I want to be with you. - You can't be with me now. Kjetil... He's my brother. Here's 8000. That's all I've got. I'll get the rest later. Come on in. Khuram... Kjetil... Kjetil! - Let's take care of this. - Come in here. I made this. It's good. There you go. Thanks. - 8000? - Yes. So you owe me 32,000? - Yes. - Fine. Come on, Kjetil. Stop kidding around. We're leaving now. Come on. We can't take the dog with us. It isn't ours. - What are you doing? - Khuram? Hi. It's Salima. Hang on. She's coming. You want the dog? Take it with you. - No, thanks. - I'll sell it to you cheap. I've got papers on it. You can have it cheap. - 10,000. - For a dog? Are you crazy? - Kjetil! - David! Stop it. Take the dog. - Take the dog. - Wait, Kjetil! Take the dog for a week. If you're happy, we'll add it to your debt. I'm just borrowing it, OK? - Take your coat off. - I'm going to my room. Take your coat off first. Take your coat off. Stop kidding around. - Did you take something from Khuram? - No. Are you sure? Yes. What've you got under there? What's under your coat? Stop it! Go to bed. Wait here, Kjetil. Where are you going? Kjetil, come here! - What are you doing? - I want ice cream. It's cold outside, and you just had breakfast. Come on. I want ice cream. - Did you bring your money? - Yes. What kind do you want? - That one. - Fine. That one? - I want two ice creams. - You only get one. - But I want two. - Listen to me... You can't afford it. You don't have enough money. Mom gives you This ice cream costs 15. That only leaves you 5. Buy two today, and you won't get any tomorrow. - But I want ice cream. - Sure, but you can't afford two. But I want two ice creams. - You fucked Khuram's sister? - Yeah. Don't tell anyone. - Has anyone talked to David? - No. - Are you dating her? - I'd never date a Paki! There's David's mongo brother. Forget it, Lars. Don't! - OK. - Thank you. David? He isn't here. - If it isn't the snitch! - Lars, don't... The rest of us kept our mouths shut! Kjetil, let's go. - Don't, Lars. - Why did you squeal? - Ask your father. - Why did you squeal? - Are you deaf? - I don't want to fight. Are you hard of hearing? Why did you squeal? I don't want any more trouble with your dad! That's enough! I said I didn't want any more trouble with you! Stay down there! - I told you not to do anything! - Morten! David, it's Khuram. Did you take anything from my place? Did you take something? Hello? Wait in the car! Mom! Mom, don't answer! - Listen to me! - What's going on? Come here! In here! - Hello? - I've got some flowers... Listen... Come here, Kjetil. You stay in here. - Go to your room! - Listen, mom... And you do as I say! Go get him. Leave us alone. Mona! It won't help if I don't get to talk to David now. The only thing that happens, is that I'll get more irritated. He's not here. Stretch him out! - Khuram... - No! It's not your turn to talk. Understand? Khuram... - No! Stay there! - Please, Khuram... Just sit there and shut up! You fucked the wrong little sister, Morten! Straighten your leg. No! Hey... I said straighten your leg. Straighten your leg! I'll never touch her again! Morten! - Hello? - Jennifer, is Jarle there? - Who is it? - Morten. The Pakis do that to you? Did you send Khuram after me? - Did you guys tell Khuram? - I just told him what you did. Why the fuck did you do that? Nobody stands by while my son gets beat up. But you came out OK, didn't you? Quiet! Can we talk? I just got beat up by Khuram. He brought this other Paki with him... Because Jarle told him that I had... You know, Khuram's sister... David! David... I need your help. - Hi, Morten. - Hi... What are you mixed up in now? - I need to talk to you. - Talk! I'm trying. Go ahead, Morten. Get the hell out of here! You shut up, mom. How can you ask me for help now? Listen to me! I've been all alone. Do you understand that? You don't have the right to ask for a damn thing! You squealed, David. What is it, Kjetil? - I want to be with you. - I'll be right up. I just need to talk to Morten, then I'll come up. Can't we do this tomorrow? I thought you wanted to talk. I'm totally beat. I'm going to bed. Kjetil, we have to get up. We have to get up. Can't you go now either, Kjetil? Can't you discard? Let me see your cards. You can discard that one, then I'll discard this. Let me look at your cards. You can discard half these cards. - You don't know how to play, do you? - Sure... You need to discard. You want to get rid of your cards. You want to get rid of everything. Green goes on green. Place it on the table. That's how you play. If you don't have any green, you change colors with this. Change to yellow, and play all your yellow cards. And so on. Red goes on red. Blue goes on blue. Red on red, blue on blue. And so on. Until you have only one card left. When you have one card left, you're supposed to say "Uno." - Uno. - If you can discard that, - - so you don't have any cards left, you're done. Then you're free. You've won. Look at you two... - Can you get the door, Kjetil? - Who is it? - You're all dressed up. - Hi, Morten. - What's the occasion? - The funeral is today. - You done, Kjetil? - Yes. - You didn't tell Morten about dad? - He hasn't been interested. - Need help with that? - Yes. - Are you doing any better, David? - No. Once when you were young, I asked you - - what you would do if I died. Do you remember what you answered? You said, "Then I'd have to make my own pancakes." What are you doing? You know I hate dogs, but you can't keep the damn door shut? I just came from the funeral. What is it with you, Morten? What is it?! - Say something! - What do you want me to say? You left me alone! Watched me get beat up! You expect me to stop Jarle, the father of the guy you ratted out? - I needed my friends! - You squealed! - You've known me your whole life. - You squealed. - My father was dying! - I didn't know about that! You should have supported me, - - instead of following some stupid, worthless code! What's important to you? To be on the best team. You have always cheered for the winning team. You think and say the same as everyone else. And then you run when things get important. Don't push me, Morten. Not today. David! David! Let go! Easy! Easy, easy... Good boy. There you go. Easy... Good boy. - Kjetil, take the dog. - I don't want to. - No... - Take him to our room. Shut the door. Kjetil? Kjetil! Sorry, David. OK? I didn't know... about your father. I would have acted differently. Sorry I'm such a chicken. I know I'm like that. Why did it take you so long to say you're sorry? Sorry. I'm tired of running. I don't want to... walk around - - being scared of things... anymore... I'm so ready to get rid of all the bullshit around me. You know? How? Let's start by cleaning this mess up. Then I'm returning this. And then I'm returning some gym keys I can't wait to get rid of. - Need a buddy? - Not one that runs away. OK? - Can we play? - You don't know how. I need to take Morten to the emergency room. The dog bit him. He needs a tetanus shot. OK? - I'm sorry. - Work things out with Morten. You and Morten need to figure this out on your own. I don't want it anywhere near me. We can talk if you want. Ask me whatever you want. But I am tired of having to fix everything. - You understand me? - Yes. - David? - Yes? Uno. - I'll be back soon. - OK. Khuram is on his way. - I can take the keys to the gym. - No, I'll come with you. Hi. - Are you here with Morten? - Yes. What are you doing? Don't do that in here. - I need the dog back. - No, you don't. The dog is mine. I gave you 8000 for it. I owe you the last 2000. - That wasn't dog money. - Talk to Jarle or Lars. All I owe you for is the dog. If you have a problem with that, you can go to hell, OK? Morten and I don't want anything more to do with you. - Outside. - Listen to me, Khuram... - Let's go. - No. You're coming outside. Hello? What the hell...? What's going on here? - It's Khuram. - Get out of here. - We can't go back outside. - I'm not talking to you. David, I want you out of here. - There are 20 Pakis out there. - You can stay. David has to go. Lars! Come down here! Go outside, Lars. Morten? So I'm finished? Yes, you're finished. You can't touch me. [Skipped item nr. 496]
