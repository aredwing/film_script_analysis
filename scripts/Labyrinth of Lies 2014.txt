I have two rascals in 6-B. Had not seen anything like it, totally wild. And the parents do nothing. Nowadays it's like that. Hey sport! Need a light? -Thank you. -No problem. LABYRINTH OF LIES Your honor, according to paragraph 2, second section of the Constitution, human life is the highest right inalienable by excellence. The office of the prosecutor is convinced that the defendant acted with premeditation and malice aforethought, which are the conditions to paragraph 211, murder. The allegation of the defense that he acted under duress is not justified. Therefore, the prosecution calls the maximum penalty: life imprisonment. -Good afternoon, Radmann. -Good afternoon. How were your first few weeks? Very exciting. I only deal with traffic tickets. We all passed through it. In a year or two you will get something decent. That's great. ...women can work only with consent from her husband. And now, Vico Torriani. ALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING. YOUR FATHER. Mr. prosecutor, what an entrance. -I'm sorry. -We've started without you. The defendant, Marlene Wondrak, acknowledges the fault, but cannot pay the fine of 50 D-Mark. It's the car of my boss. I don't want her to know and I only have 30. -Mr. Radmann. - Yes? With your permission we will reduce the fine to 25 D-Mark. And a promise that she will use her little head to concentrate on the traffic if she cannot avoid driving. Do you agree? No. Excuse me? The amount of the fine is fixed in the law. We can make no exceptions. But I don't have the money. The law does not allow it. You clause stallion!!! Are you going to send me to jail for 3 days? No, but... Well, mr prosecutor, what do we do now? The fine is paid. Can I go now or do I have to end up in jail? Don't think that I am grateful. You will get your money back. As soon as I have it. Unbearable man! Damn, she's so spicy. It is a disgrace, it is a scandal, outrageous! There is a killer loose on the street. Mr. Kirsch has recognized him. We've been to 3 police stations but they don't care. Good morning, Mr. Gnielka. Looking for a story for your newspaper? I already have a story, prosecutor. There is a killer on the loose, he was a member of the Waffen-SS in Auschwitz. Now he teaches children. Are you interested? What a zealos man you are! Let's go, Gnielka. This is pointless. Alois Schulz, Unterscharfhrer in the Waffen-SS, now teaches history in Goethe-Gymnasium. Are you interested? You? And what about you? Get out! Come on, Simon, let's go before I vomit. Throw this away, please. The show is over, gentlemen. Back to work now. - Where is the Office of Education? -In the Rmer. I suspect something. And I do not like it. -The Club will win the league. -If Egon stays in shape. I have checked the record of that Schulz, it's missing from 39 to 45. Whom? The teacher, that the journalist mentioned. Well, that's ambitious. After 45 the Yankees confiscated tons of files. Denazification by the allies is a fact. Gnielka is a unpatriotic mercenary. Don't let him fool you. Excuse me, document center? -Second floor. -Thank you. Sorry, but the center is not open to everyone. I am investigating someone. Now he is a teacher. I need to know what he was doing during the war. He was a Nazi. You were all Nazis. In the Eastern sector, now you are all communists. Jesus, you Germans! If little green men from Mars landed tomorrow, you would all become green. Kid, you are very young. But your father was a Nazi. What? No. He hated the Nazis. Yeah, right. After 45 everybody is suddenly in the resistance against Hitler. And you are here by which authority? State prosecutor's office, Frankfurt. Good morning. Good morning. Therefore, I request three years of imprisonment. Good job, Haller. Mr. attorney general, If there is nothing more, I would like to finish the meeting. Mr. chief prosecutor. Yes, Mr. Radmann? -That teacher, Schulz... - What Schulz? The case of Mr. Gnielka. I beg your pardon? I have researched t. Schulz was in the Waffen-SS. He consealed it when was hired in 1947. He shouldn't be a teacher. Here is my report. Let me see. Yes, that's interesting. You know what? I will send it to the Ministry of Education. Gentlemen, next Wednesday, at the same time. Your mother has left this for you. - What? When? -A moment ago. She's been waiting for you, but your father was honking outside, so impatient. Like all men! He is not my father. My father is missing since 45. Eastern front. I'm sorry. - He really said that? - Word of honor. Mr. Gnielka. - Do you remember me? - I know who you are. I have taken care of Schulz. The ministry is suspending him. Suspending? What is he accused of? You believe he killed someone? He was at Auschwitz. Don't you know what that means? Wasn't that a protective custody camp? Trust me, they did not protect anyone there. I can't believe it! Watch this. Have you ever heard of Auschwitz? -No. -That's what I'm talking about. - Does Auschwitz mean anything to you? - No, and I have work. - How old are you? - 20. -And you've never heard of Auschwitz, right? -I have not. The greatest catastrophe of humanity, Is forgotten and hushed up. What are you talking about? A German prosecutor who knows nothing about Auschwitz - that's a shame. And if they suspend Schulz, I'll eat my hat. We do not have any guides on Poland. Not even one. And regarding that... -Auschwitz. -Yes, Auschwitz. There are two books about it. One is no longer in the catalog and the other should be in Kassel. - Should I order it? -Yes, please. It will take 8-10 weeks. How can I help you? Mr. attorney general, can we talk? Perfect, I want one such as this. What's going on? Schulz is still teaching. I went to the school. Acute lack of teachers. It is up to the ministry. It is beyond my competence and even more of yours. But Schulz served in Auschwitz. All of them had camps. Americans, Russians. I spent half a year in a French one. Don't tell my wife, but they cooked better than her. I was forced to see a movie about it after the war. It is all propaganda. The winners invent stories. We've lost the war. Why to snoop around now? Hello. You were right. - What do you mean? -The teacher still teaches. What can we do... The journalist was waiting for you in your office. Funny guy. "The young and ambitious prosecutor Radmann investigated the past of the teacher Schulz. The ministry of education received the report on march 25 but ignoring his membership in the Waffen-SS." And so on. "Intolerable scandal." Oh boy. I would not like to be you right now. The general wants to see you. Sr. Radmann, the article contains internal information. Did you leak it? No. - But why the ministry did not... -Do not be naive. Do you think that the Nazis disappeared after the death of Hitler? I assure you that it's not the case. This is not the case. But we can not allow him to teach children. We have to bring him to justice. But serving in a camp is not a crime. Even though it is embarrassing. Anyway, all crimes would have prescribed three years ago. Except for the murder. But is there any? Any concrete murder? Any particular victim? Open your eyes, mr. Radmann. The civil service is full of Nazis, small and large fish. And none of them have anything to fear. The new evening edition! The new evening edition! Khrushchev renewed the ultimatum! the 14th anniversary of Hiroshima! - Have you gone mad? -The article hit the nail on the head. -I will sue you for stealing my report. -I shit in fear. I almost got fired! You should be ashamed! I'd be ashamed not to publish such type of stories. I don't understand. How can he keep all this in secret? How? It is easy to. They all did the same thing, as Schulz. Came home, hung the uniform and continued as if nothing happened. No one asks because nobody wants to know. Are you free this evening? Sorry. Sometimes we the journalists skip the rules. Please feel free to stop. There will be beautiful girls, sausages and beer. Not necessarily in that order. Typical man. They need water. I Am Inge. The beer is there. Thanks. First class, huh? Come, I will introduce you. I can do it myself. Friends and fighters, I've discovered a very rare specimen. A lawyer who still has a spark of humanity under the armor. -You are indeed a poet. -Thank You, Simon. Please, wellcome him to our anarchist circle, so the spark become an intense open flame. That's theft, isn't it? Do not you think to arrest me? A small theft. The would get 4-6 weeks in jail . Don't you have a heart. You always like that? Why don't you find out? Maybe you're right. It's chocking. -We must take Simon home. -I'll drive him. You're too drunk. I can drive. They are nice people, aren't they? I saw it right away. What do you mean? Pretty young lady, lovely cutie, sweetheart, sugarpants. And Marlene likes you. He really was in the camp? Yes, but doesn't talk about it. "The angel of death." The first picture he painted after Auschwitz. Incredible, he's eligible for compensation, but he does not want it. That darn money! We should proof those idiots he was in Auschwitz. Can I do something? Yes, you can help. Here must be something somewhere. Nothing. Get down that suitcase. But I can't... No! Let me do it. Bingo. What are you doing? We are helping you. How you dare? Simon. I don't want your help. You have no right poking around in my things. -Simon. -Out! Out! Out! He's a stubborn dog. But at least we found something. -Perhaps something for everyone here. Nothing here. Neither here. This has a header of Auschwitz concentration camp. Look at this. "shot on the run." And? "Shot on the run" means murder. And here are the names of the killers. The order above all. Amazing, isn't it? Come with me. Sorry for the inconvenience, but I think that is important. These are official documents of Auschwitz. The SS men who shot prisoners. Watch: "Schmidt, Milde, Siebert..." It's an evidence, right? Come in. Where did you get that? From an Auschwitz survivor. Well. That's a good start. - What? There are crimes, perpetrators, victims, dates. The attorney can act. We can investigate. What's there to investigate?. We have the names. You must stop the killers. Don't be stupid, Sr. Gnielka. That is not enough yet. Mr. Attorney General, if possible, I would like to get involved. I would like to help. You will not help, Mr. Radmann. You will lead the investigation. And no more articles in the meantime. You will warn the suspects. Agree. Gentlemen, if we succeed to accuse these men in Germany it would be extraordinary. Schmittchen! What's up? - No more traffic offenses. A new life begins. -I don't know what you want. -We took some of the documents. There was a list. I need to know where it's from. Was it in the suitcase? I have no idea. The release was chaotic, we took what we could. Why do you ask? I am investigating the crimes in Auschwitz. Did you witness any crimes during your stay? My "stay"? - This Schulz, what did he do? He was an SS pig Have you seen him killing someone? No. I need witnesses, Mr. Kirsch. You have to testify. What for? Look around. Skirts, "pack me a swimsuit", pink and sky blue. The country wants sugar glaze. doesn't want the truth. I have to work. Here are the names of the suspects. We need their whereabouts. In summary, they were in a camp in Poland during the war and the police has to find them for killing people. But they were soldiers. Was it not their duty? You will hear from me. Good morning. Who is going to pursue the illegal parking now? Location? Still alive? Speed ticket. Fine 100 D-Mark. -Inge, lend me 100 D-Mark. -You deserve it! But I don't have money, Radmann. So you lose. The prosecutor has no mercy. -There are people who deserve to be punished. -And you punish them all. Only those who deserve it. Who hears my plea and lends me money? I made a house on the Goethe street and I have my fashion workshop. So I can stop sewing curtains to Ms. Brettschneider. Oh, no! Here's a fair punishment! Nothing happened, children. Show yourself, you cowards! I won't shut up! - I write what I want! -Thomas, are you crazy? Gnielka, please! I told you that the article hit the nail on the head. Now you see? They're everywhere. I want the addresses of the survivors, it's important. You pay them a reparation, So you have their address. No, I'll pick you up myself. Yes. Until then. Schmittchen, take a dictation, please. Hermann Langbein is the president of the association of survivors. Send him a telegram. Dear Mr. Langbein... -Mr. Langbein. -Mr Radmann. Thank you for coming. Where is the witness? Mr. Bichinsky, what are you waiting for? Schmittchen, the first witness. Mr. Bichinsky was in Auschwitz for two years. Yes, I was there since August, 1943 until we were liberated by the Russians in January of 1945. Continue, please. Do you recognize the names on the list? No. - Neither one? Are you sure? -Yes. Can you testify about the crimes committed in the camp? Yes. I can. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed. We will need the names of the victims. Haven't you heard him? Hundreds of thousands, it was a factory. How can he know the names? Well. Then I will write "victims unknown". My wife and my son were murdered there. Sorry. Can you give me the date when it happened? The SS did not give us a calendar. What do you think that Auschwitz was? A summer camp by the lake? Mr. Bauer, who is this rookie that brought me here? Can we talk a moment? Do you want a coffee? Schmittchen, coffee, please. We'll be back right away. The list is not enough. What do you suggest? I will ask Bichinsky what he saw. Concrete actions. That means that all SS men from Auschwitz are suspected. -All of them. -Yes, that's clear to me. I want to know what happened there. Mr. Radmann... This is a labyrinth. Do not lose yourself. Sr. Bichinsky, tell me everything you have experienced. Where to start? At the beginning. What did he do? Hans Brandner struck the witness with a whip until fainting. The witness has lost an eye. Why did Brandner hit? Because he dared to look at him. -We arrest him now. - What? No. - Why not? -We don't have charges. -But... -It is not a murder. Everything else has prescribed. What are we doing here? I have to see him. I have to see what kind of man he is. -Thank you. -You are as beautiful as your mother. How kind, Mr. Brandner. I see. Wait. - Mr. Brandner? - Yes? I think we know each other. I do not remember. Of course we do. I never forget a face. I don't know. You are not from around here, right? Try one. You will not find better. Sorry, I have to make a delivery. Come. My robe, Schmittchen, fast! Stay sitted. How do you imagine that? You want to bring people from Poland, Israel, and God knows where else. We even do not have diplomatic relations with these countries. And for what? To prove that someone did something in Poland during the war. These people witnessed thousands of murders. What murders? Be realistic. What is the purpose? We had no choice. Those who refused, died. In addition, all of this in Nrnberg after the war. 150 men were sentenced in Nrnberg. By the allies, not by Germans. It's not finished yet. I'm sorry, attorney, You need to be in court. This is unprecedented. A country that condemns its own soldiers for their actions during the war. You're not going anywhere. Do you know one thing? I love this country. Still. In spite of everything. It has suffered so much. And you are only going to open old wounds that just starting to heal. Did you know that Bauer is a jew? He was in a camp in 1933. Seems he's never got over. - Carefull, Toni! - Marlene! Toni, I said carefull. Nothing has happened. Dad, this is Johann Radmann. We went to the cinema and he brought me home. Pleased to meet you. -Come, I'll make you dinner. -Thank you. -Debt of honor. -No, this... Come again. What do you need? I am looking for the camp of Auschwitz. You are totally out of your mind. Nobody wants that. You do not and neither do we. Leave things as they are. man, Hitler has gone. The Russians are the new enemy. I need the files of the SS men who served in Auschwitz. All of them. 10 million nazis. Incredible, isn't it? These idiots wrote down everything. If you believe that you can bring them to justice It's like believing in Santa Claus. I only am interested in Auschwitz. You brought a truck with you? Here, 600,000 SS files. About 8,000 served in Auschwitz. But you will have to dig them out yourself. Thanks. It was a machine. What? Auschwitz. It was a killing machine of 8000 sharks large, small, bureaucratic, sadistic... Two months ago I had 15 names, now I have 8,000 SS men. That is 8,000 suspects, Gnielka. My lasts case was for driving without a license. Think of it like this: the more enemies, the greater the honor. What do we drink to? Veritas. It was the motto of my father. To the truth. 8.000 Schulzes and Brandners. And I need witnesses for all. -Let us in. - What do you want? You have to testify. - On what? - You are a witness, Mr. Kirsch. I need your statement. -I don't want to talk about it. -Simon, please. You must testify. You owe it to the victims. What do I owe to whom? What do you want? Didn't you have enough? What do you want? Do you want to investigate Auschwitz? Do you think that you're going to change something? You have no idea. No idea. Why? My girls. Ruth and Klara. So small. We arrived early morning, we were hundreds, thousands. We were hungry and cold. It was very cold. We were surrounded by the SS with their dogs. Everyone, go, go, quick, quick, in a row. Hannah went away on a truck. Suddenly there was... this doctor. He wore white gloves. Looked like an angel. He was very calm. He knelt down to see Ruth and Klara. He stroked Ruth's head, smiled, and said: "Your twins are cute. I'll take them to my station." And I thought he was a doctor, that they would be safe. Then the others told me what Mengele does with twins. He tortured them with his experiments. Injected viruses, typhus, tuberculosis, diphtheria. Cut them open without anesthesia. removed organs. inserted needles in the head. He sewed the twins, young children, back-to-back, as if they were siamese. And I gave them to him. Why they are dead and I'm alive? We will bring that doctor to the justice. I promise. There was a doctor in the camp. Dr. Josef Mengele. You know the stories? We need to get him, Dr. Josef Mengele. He is Auschwitz. All those who participated, who have not said no, are Auschwitz. How are you getting on? Calmly and objectively, Only say what you clearly remember. Ms. Mandelbaum. Come, please. We go to revision. -Do you agree, Haller. -It will be a pleasure. Mr. attorney general, I need help for my investigation. Give him Mr. Haller. Attorney general, please. I can not give Haller, he already has a lot of work. This case is of our highest priority. Please Even the chancellor Adenauer has made it clear This unfortunate chapter must end. A trial would be deadly. On the contrary. What is deadly is to shut up. It would be deadly for a young democracy. In addition, the one who decides here is me. This is my case. I design a strategy, and you work with me. and you put me up to date. Quiet, don't bite. I am in charge of the investigation by the orders of the attorney general. Yes, the child has grown. - Who are the suspects? - All of them. What do you mean, all? -All those who served there. -That's ridiculous. "Here, a child, about five years old, jumped off the truck. he had an apple in his hand. Boger was at the door. The child stood there happy with his apple. Boger approached the child, grabbed him by the feet and slammed his head against the wall. Then Boger took the apple and told me to clean up the wall. And then Boger ate the apple." That was every day life in Auschwitz. Don't you find this ridiculous? How many addresses do you have? The authorities don't cooperate. -Take the phone books. - Excuse me? I'm fed up. Bring all telephone books in Germany. We will find the addresses ourself. Mengele was the worst of all. Do you know why? Because he was like us. He studied, became a doctor, took the Hippocratic oath, likes opera, the culture. He is like us. He was your age when arrived at Auschwitz. I look at his photo... Have you seen his picture? He seems... Seems nice. If we let someone like him go free, we are lost. Come on, Gnielka, I want to dance with my man. -Johann, come. -For a moment. Our hero is tired. You're going to catch him. Don't worry. Ladies, I'm here. Marching happy with our troop the comrades killed by the red front... What's going on? The war comrades of my father. They come once a month and get drunk. It is terrible. Pioneer-Battalion 221, "every shot is a Russian." Today I can not stand that. Come, let's go to the Main. No, take me to your house. My landlady has ears like a lynx. I'll take you home. My dear. Life is beautiful. Can you tell me what country and city have the code 005411? Thanks, I will wait. I know where Mengele is. What? Where? International calls of Mengele family in Gnzburg. Thanks. Buenos Aires, Argentina. I will go to the federal police. We have enough against the baker, Brandner. Issue an order. I will. Mengele is in Buenos Aires. Here is his phone number, it should be enough. Here is the warrant for his arrest. Please, bring him to Germany. An interesting theory. Unfortunately, the federal police has a very limited means. And South America is so far away. But I'll deal with it gladly. I will take you to the station. -No need. - Yes, I'll drive you. Now we can talk. We already know that Mengele is located in Buenos Aires. We have quite a dossier on him, but... But what? Those who fled abroad in 45 are taboo. It is an order from above. Can you help me in any way? We know he repeatedly travels to Gnzburg to see his family. He is coming to Germany? On a regular basis. He knows that there is almost no risk. Thanks. I don't have time to take you to the station, just wanted to talk. Oh, certainly. Thanks anyway. You have been to the federal police. - How do you know? - Sit down. Still don't understand the magnitude of all this. Mengele, Eichmann, and others are protected by powerful friends. We can't trust anyone. No one. -But I know where Mengele is. -Yes, but you must leave it. You got an order for his arrest, leave it there. Attorney general... Focus on the other suspects and leave Mengele to me. Do you understand? He said all. We need to go through all these looking for suspects? Yes. I'm not taking those up. Your ideas always give me work. Mengele's father died. - When are your people in Gnzburg? -You know how our store is running. That is all I can do. Do you think he is inside? If Mengele has to come to Germany at some point, it is now. It stays there. Do not know how to read? It is a private event. Johann Radmann, the office of the attorney general of Frankfurt. We are looking for Josef Mengele. You scared me. Thanks. Can you do something for me? Do you know where's Mengele? All the people of Gnzburg work in the factory of Mengele. They won't say anything. But my father says he saw him in the cemetery today. He recognized him. But then he drove away. I have to go back. Here, you hear a lot of things. Please call me if he re-appears. -He did this to the children. -I don't want to see it. Have a good look. This is what Josef Mengele did to children. I know that today he was in Gnzburg. The border police should check all passengers to South America. No, it is not "Naegele", "Mengele". Martha, Emil, Nordpol, Gustav, Emil, Ludwig, Emil. Look again, it has to be in the list. There is an order. There is no time for a written request he will be gone. I can not believe it. - Where have you been? - Why? The baker, Brandner, is gone. - What? - Has been and now gone. Because you have not issued a warrant -Yes, you had to play Zorro. -You know... I don't care! We are state prosecutors. Behave as one. And do not drink alcohol in my office. The attorney general want to see you right away. Goodbye. You acted against my orders. Shut up. How could you let escape Brandner? You were busy doing the ridicule in Gnzburg. What were you thinking? I was at his father's funeral. How does he dare to return to Germany? Why? Because he knows we let him escape every time. You've been on the case for 4 months. What results do you have? None. We are out of time. Right now, the minister of justice supports me. But after the elections it can change. And I'm gone. There will be no trial. Without Mengele, the trial is meaningless. Do you want to accuse a phantom? Your obsession with Mengele puts in danger the entire investigation. And what about the others? Mulka, Commandant Baer. They are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths. Aren't they dramatic enough for you? Here. "If you continue like this, You can also visit the gas." "A traitor is the worst garbage of the country." "Life or death, Jew?" etc., etc. That's why we are doing this. The germans have to see the crimes which are committed not by Hitler or Himmler, but by normal people that did it voluntarily. Them we will bring to justice. To the great trial. That's the way, believe me. And that's your job. Mr. Mulka, I am Radmann, prosecutor. You have not responded to our subpoenas, I'm glad to find you well. What do you want? You were the deputy commander of Auschwitz. - And? - I'm investigating. Look, I was a soldier. Never set foot in this camp. I don't know what was going on there. Give me a break! You were the right hand of the commander. We wll take you to the justice. Leave me alone Or you will get so many troubles you won't know where they come from. -We call it quits. -I will continue. You know what, Radmann? You definitely are crazy. But you definitely are not a green man. Here are more photos of the ramp. Left, right. Left, right. Left... Do you know where is the right, Anton? Right, left... Who has misbehaved? Alois Schulz, you are arrested for accessory to murder hundreds of thousands men. I only did administrative work. Here. This is you. Yes. Several witnesses have claimed that you made selections on the ramp. -Sent victims to the gas chamber. -Yes, but... Mr. Schulz, please. The thing is. It has to be prooved that Mr. Schulz made those selections. The photo is out of focus. The camp seems like a horrible place. Those who arrived there after a grueling journey, were in a state of shock. I doubt that the testimonies of those poor people are valid almost twenty years later. And even if Mr. Schulz did select someone, he did it in order to protect those who can work from the gas chamber. It was an act of saving human life. Enough! Mr. Radmann, I do not share your interpretation of the law. Mr. Schulz has declared that he only followed orders, which was his duty. Your client is suspected in murder and will remain in custody. You should be gased, you bastard. Gentlemen. No one thought. We just had to open our eyes. Shit. I have one. - Good day. - Gosh! I've got sweaty. -I have forgotten. - What? - And? And? -This, fool. How is this? -Very nice. -Rerspect. -Marlene, we are... -Come on, the fine people waiting. Get out. Come on! The americans had just to let go. I was 35 years old with no experience as a practicing attorney. And then came my first client looking for a lawyer to register a patent. Free, of course. Since then we have grown a lot. - Why were we invited? -I don't know. But I have a hunch. How much potential they have. -I'm dying of hunger, Walter. -And me. Are we going? I don't like to see a good lawyer wasting his talent. I will introduce you to the Dr. Mertens. Excuse me. Can I ask you a question? Tell me, where can I buy a dress like this in Frankfurt? Ah, this... In her store, of course. Do you have a fashion studio? I'm just starting. Your fiance? Congratulations. But you are also awesome. Respect, Employee of Prof. Rimmelbacher. -Correct, isn't it? -Yes. You are precisely the person that I need. Young, enthusiastic. There is only one propper way to channel your energy. -Thank you... -I know. You do not have to decide now, think about it. You already know where to find me. Four ladies have ordered dresses Oh Johann. That was a wonderful evening. The prosecutor Radmann. Mr. Radmann, Mr. Kleiner, German correspondent from the Jerusalem Post. These two gentlemen are from Israel. Nice to meet you. I've asked him to come because he knows much about Josef Mengele, including his current residence. We are cooperating to take Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele in Argentina and bring them here. Please share your information with these gentlemen. Will you bring us Mengele? If someone can bring him in, it's us. Kleiner is not just a journalist, right? No. Can we trust him? Who can you trust? I'm still in exile, but not in Sweden. When I leave the office, I'm at the enemy's territory. I trust you. Carefull. It is not dry yet. It is beautiful, Simon, thanks. Johann! Well, The big moment has come. -As new. -I had always wanted one as well. To Marlene. Cheers! "Dear housewife, your dream has become a reality: the new Pfaff Automatik 230, is the sewing machine with countless possibilities." Fantastic, isn't it? We're on the verge. We will judge Mengele in Frankfurt. "make your friends jealous and your husband happy." It is amazing you fall asleep so easily. Mr. prosecutor is not excited about a cool sewing machine. Just closed my eyes for a moment, Because I was dazzled by the beauty of your sewing machine. Careful, your nose is growing. A good businessman always keeps the record. Of course. You are wonderful. Thank you, Joseph. Mr. Mulka. A warrant for your arrest. What is this? Evidence of wilful murder. An order of Zyklon B signed by Robert Mulka. Haupsturmfhrer, assistant. It was too long ago, I don't remember. No need, it's good enough. We arrest you for aiding and abetting thousands of murders. Come with us, please. Take something, Mr. Attorney General. Younger every day, how do you do that? Cheers! -It looks good. -homemade. Of course, as all the bakers are fleeing from Mr Radmann... Where is your sheriff's star? - What? - With your Wild West methods you should wear a cowboy hat and star of sheriff. This is unacceptable. What do you say? Why do you make a mockery of our work? Because this trial is a show, it is harmful and disgusting and it has nothing to do with the law. Of course you will think that. Come on, say it. You believe I was also a Nazi. You are convinced, right? For Mr Radmann, everyone is a Nazi. Why not ask me what I did in the war? If you are interested I'll tell you. Law studies in Heidelberg, Then the navy, lieutenant of the seventh fleet. After the war, prisoner in France for a year. Released in August 1946, I served with honor. And by the way, I was never a member of the party. Do you still want to arrest me? These men must pay for their crimes in the court of law. Of course, the justice is your exclusive domain. Accusing a few small fish while millions remain undisturbed. What kind of justice is that? These "small fish" are criminals. Did you think about the consequences? Do you want all of the young germans asking if their fathers are murderers? Yes, that's what I want. I want to end the lies and the silence. Richard Baer, the last commandant of Auschwitz. You're under arrest. Mr. Kaduk, You're under arrest. You held the head of the prisoner under water until he drowned. Forced the group to spend night outside of the barracks in the winter. Two froze to death. Dr. Berger, come with us. In charge of prisoners transportation. Continued kicking with boots until he fell dead to the ground. Shot the child who was in the arms of the mother. Both died. Mr. Rinke. You're under arrest. Supplied Zyklon B to the system. Rushed prisoners with dogs to the electric fence. It was not an order, it was your own initiative. Start telling the truth. The arrests of Richard Baer, the last commandant of Auschwitz, and Robert Mulka are the sum of our efforts to prosecute these crimes. Prosecutor, I have a question. - What will be the charges? -Murder. Kirsch had a heart attack, he's in the hospital. It was close. I have never said Kaddish. What do you mean? In the camp, God... He was not there. As I was laying there, waiting for the doctor I only thought that I didn't say Kadish for Ruth and Klara, my girls. I can't, I can't go back there. Please, do it for me. Go to Auschwitz and do it for me. Say Kadish for them. You will do it when you get over. Today I cheated death for the second time. Do it for me. No, I have to deal with the trial first. Please. No, Simon, I don't have time for this. I have to take care of the trial. Johann! Johann! -They brought Eichmann to Israel. - What? How? It's amazing! Attorney-general. Good news. I would have preferred to have you here. But Bonn refuses extradition to Israel. When they bring us Mengele? Do they have him? It's like in Frankfurt. Mengele has left Argentina. What? Where is he? There are rumors that he is in Paraguay. The Mosad has to go and get him. Sr. Radmann, this is not a catalog in which orders are placed. It is much more complicated. You did not want Eichmann so we took care of him. All right, but you have to bring Mengele to Germany we will judge him here. Imagine two deer in a clearing. If you shoot one, the other is going. What do you mean? Mengele is gone. Now he is not a priority for us. But you promised... Our priority always was Eichmann. Bauer also. How? Eichmann organized the "final solution". Mengele... Bring Mengele to Germany, I beg you. The UN security council already scolded us because of Eichmann. We are a small young country, we do not need new enemies. We are already surrounded by enemies. Mengele could be anywhere. We have to bring him to Europe. He travels under a different name. Otherwise, we would have got him in Gnzburg. I need that name, Mr. Fischer. I was so close. It is not the fault of my car. Hello. Kathi, right? Sit down, please. I don't have much time, I'll be late on the train. The young Mengele was there. I've heard his mother talking to my boss. He flies back today from Frankfurt. I wanted to call the police, but my boss... Thank you. I have to talk with Fischer. Where is he? It is urgent. Mr. Fischer is suspended. Your generation knows no loyalty. I need Mengele's travelling name. Please. I told them, it loses oil. - Can you fix it? - The engine is gone. We do not know what name he uses. Why go to the airport? I will know Mengele when I see him, believe me. Well? Mr. Radmann, What is that supposed to be? Mr. Wisnievska is very angry. You convinced him to testify And we just sit there! Mr. Langbein, I do what I can. What do you do in Frankfurt, mom? You don't call. What happened? Did you move out of office? Son, we need to talk. I need to work. Don't be stubborn, Johann, it is important. Please, go away. Gustav has asked me me to marry him and I accepted. You are married. After 15 years of not coming home. I asked to declare him dead. I want you to come to my wedding. No. Gustav was a Nazi. How you dare? You don't even know him. He was in the party, as everyone. My father was not. Of course he was! What? Dad was a member of the party, He had no choice, as Gustav. Enough is enough. You're lying. Get out of here! You stain the honor of dad to excuse that Gustav. - Get out! -Be reasonable. Dad? Don't do it. I need to know. Don't do it. Kurt Radmann, born in Marburg in 1898. Can you check if he was a member of the party? Wait in the hall. Marlene. Johann, how nice. One moment. You're drunk. How can I bear it otherwise? I already have a drunk in the house, don't need another one. Sure, Miss Wondrak operates now in higher circles. You have forgotten one thing. - Were's the swastika? - What? That dress is for the wife of a Nazi criminal. What? Are you crazy? Mertens, Lichter, all those fine people are criminals. How do I know? Because this is a country of criminals and they all behave as if nothing had happened. All these colors... We Germans should wear black. Forever and ever. And you're doing this. Beware! Are you crazy? I have to turn it in tomorrow. You have become unbearable. See only the bad. You're blind. -Not everyone is bad. - I am blind? Battalion pioneer 221. Your father served in Poland. I have investigated. Do you know what he did? Ask him once, why is he drinking. I don't believe you. How do you dare to do this? Get out! I don't want to see you again! Out! The sheriff Radmann and his faithful companion, the chief Sharp pen. Struggle against many but in the end the good triumphs. In the end, the bad guys die. The sheriff Radmann and the chief Sharp Pen... - How did you know what that meant? - What? What "shot on the run" means. Tell me, how did you know that? I was there. What? In Auschwitz. I was there. You were in Auschwitz? During the war? -Liar. -Stop. You don't know. -What you are. -You don't know what... I know too much. I know that you are a liar and a hypocrite. That is the worst. Have you forgotten who I am, Johann? Listen to me. Do you want to know what I did? I was 17 years old. They enlisted my entire class as child soldiers and we were sent to Auschwitz. Of course, carry orders, the great excuse. And in the end everything is Hitler's fault. You wanted to know, isn't it? Well, listen to me, damn it. We had to keep an eye on the prisoners. There was a Polish professor, Tadeusz Rosenthal. I passed him bread and cigarettes, but they caught him with it. To punish him, they threw his hat. over the fence. And told him to pick it up. And then he was shot. "Shot on the run". You get it, Johann? As in the list. You make me sick. All you give me is disgust. You're drunk. What did you do? Were you a Nazi? - Were you one of them? - Idiot! You. Why didn't you do anything? Why did you collaborate? It's outrageous! Lump! You all were there. You were a Nazi. You were a... Why me? - What does this mean? -The trial, the investigation. Why me? Because you were born in 1930. - You are unbiased -No. Because I was naive enough to let you burn me. By the way, my father was also a Nazi. What did you expect? Almost all the lawyers were members of the party. He was just as guilty as the others. If you think that this is about who is guilty or innocent you have not understood anything. I resign. You can't abandon us. I'm very happy. I think you have made the best decision. You will start on Monday. I have heard. Congratulations. I wanted to thank you for your help, Schmittchen. Save it. Our client is wrong. He violated a patent law. We can only... Son, we can't pay for all this if our clients are "wrong". Yes. -Peter. -Hans. Very well. Mr. Lichter, Mr. Radmann. I consult with Mr. Lichter if there is something dirty. I am just brilliant, I'll do whatever it takes for our customers. Can I? Gentlemen, work out a strategy. Money is not an issue. I'm glad that we work together. Now. The man has not been born to be a hero. Right? Mr Radmann? I was as blind as the others. What do you think now? I don't know. But there is something that I do not understand, Simon. How can you continue to live here? How can you continue to live in Germany? Look. I arrived from Vienna at 18. I met Hannah in the hats section of Schneider's shop. My daughters were born in the university hospital. and on the Fressgasse they got their first ice cream We were going to feed the ducks in the Grueneburgpark. One pinched Klara's hand. Tell me. Where else can I go? I can go to Auschwitz to say Kadish. I would like to. Can you give me the book? Gnielka has to go with you. No, I will go alone. Bubeleh... All right. Why haven't you said anything? Because it gives me shame. Because I didn't do anything and I kept on watching. Kept my mouth shut and watched. And what about the trial? How can you give up everything? I've always wanted to fight for a good cause. But since I don't know what that is. How can I judge other people? If I had been... I don't know what I would have done. Don't you see what's at stake, Johann. Look around you. What do you see? Auschwitz. No. You see a meadow. Three barracks, a fence. Auschwitz is the stories that are buried here. Without the trial these stories will remain buried. There is no appropriate punishment for what happened here. This is not to punish. It's about the victims, their stories. What do we do now? Simon wrote it down. What brings you back? The only answer to Auschwitz is doing the right thing. Good morning. You're back? I am sorry. Get over it. No one is perfect. Except me. Thanks. Goodbye. Hello. What do you want? I have to make some repairs. He is to me. What do you want? Can I fix this? That's completely destroyed. I know. But it means a lot for me. No, the tear is too large. You can't fix it. I don't care what it costs. Buy yourself a new one. And treat it better. I guess I'll have to accept it. Yes, you have to accept it. What a good life. Friends, cake, and champagne. What else can you ask for? My mother didn't make the cake just for you. Let the boy eat, he is still growing. To the day of trial, To the prosecutor's office of Frankfurt. And to you, Johann. L'chaim. To life. L'chaim. To life. And that's it. Johann. I brought the jacket. I thought the tear is irreparable. Not quite. The trial begins tomorrow. I know. Good luck. You will testify on Friday. Are you ready? Rookie, I've been ready for 20 years. I'm going to enter. Gentlemen, today we are making history. I'm proud of you. The meeting and negotiation of the presiding judge at the Regional Court in Frankfurt am Main is opened. The Auschwitz trial began in 1963. 211 survivors of the camp have given their testimony. In the biggest trial in the German history were tried 19 SS members who served in Auschwitz. 17 have been convicted. During the 20 months of the trial, they showed no remorse or insight. Fritz Bauer died in 1968 of heart failure. Josef Mengele lived undisturbed in Brazil until 1979. He died in a swimming accident. This trial was a turning point in German history. The crimes of the Nazi era could no longer be denied. Dedicated to the attorney general Fritz Bauer, the prosecutors Joachim Kugler, Georg Friedrich Vogel, Gerhard Wiese and the journalist Thomas Gnielka. Translated for Danielle Shamir
