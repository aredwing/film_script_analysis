When this here Cisco Kid does a job, he does it right. I wish I had my hands on him. I do good job-a myself. We've got to form a vigilante committee and hang him to the highest tree... and I'm going to start it. They say he'll shoot you quick as he'll look at you. But if I ever meet him face-to-face, I'll kill him like I would a dog. What? You would kill somebody? - You heard me. - I kill him too. First I try to get my $87 back. - Huh? - You lose $87, my friend? Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. That is too bad. I hate to see working man lose so much money.

Tonia Maria, this law is closing in around me. Tonight, I am sure that this-this life I live- it does not pay, but- but like the man who is caught in the- in the whirl- whirlpool, I cannot get out. That is what a thief comes to know. He cannot rub out his past. Ah, he may be able to get away from these people... who hunt for him... but he can never get away from himself. I go on, Tonia, till the chapter here is finished, but... [ Scoffs ] I know in the end I will pay. Tonia... we will go far away tonight together, huh? To Portugal! Ah, Tonia, I try.

"Remember, he will wear a large, white mantilla. You will be able to see it from a distance. " You get the idea, boys? The bandit's gonna try to escape tonight in a girl's clothes. Well, this is empty. - You have more, eh? - No, no. No. I have had... enough. The job's finished, boys. I get my man tonight. Get him alone. You better let us go with ya, Sarge. No, sir. I've got a particular reason for wanting to turn this trick all by myself. So long, boys. The old sarge has got a new gal... and she's a pippin. - [ Clicks Tongue ] - Hey, we ought to go along with him anyway. Nah, nah. Didn't I tell ya he was the best shot in the army?

You must stay here tonight. I am afraid to be here alone. Tomorrow, you can go. But I will not let you go tonight. Hmm. Such anxiety is touching. [ Chuckles ] You are so beautiful... I could not refuse you... anything. [ Chuckles ] Ay! We should have gone... to Portugal tonight. I better look around outside to make sure there is no danger. I- [ Hoofbeats ] Somebody is out there. [ Gasps ] Adis, my beautiful angel. That is what you are. And what you will be... an angel. When I ride away... you stand outside where I can see you... and wave good-bye to me. Then I know you love me. If it is to be the end, I want to know that... you are thinking only of me. My beautiful angel. Adis. - Adis. - Don't forget... to wave to me when I ride away.
