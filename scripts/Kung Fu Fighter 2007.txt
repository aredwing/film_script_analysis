All heroes wanted to claim a name, As money and power would come by. This was a place of chaos. Either dead or alive. ''Welcome, Master Ma.'' lt's going to start! Hurry up... ''This is the next round. Thank you, Ming.'' You bastard. Last time you took 2 dollars fewer. What the hell did you do? ''Sorry, Ming. l'll be careful next time.'' ''Villager, you're not here to herd cows.'' You got to notice everything around you. ''Yes, Ming.'' City bum. What a jerk. Handicap Surnamed Ma? Ming... Where does the boxer next match come from? Both are local guys. What's up? You have money to bet? l just ask. Call your dad. ''He fights well, isn't he? Get him to help you.'' Stop it! Let him go... Beat him up! Burn the coward's wife and son! ''Son, run, leave me alone...'' Run! ''Manik, leave this place.'' l'll find your dad in Shanghai. ''Promise me, OK?'' You're the same as dad. Great strength. l don't knowifit's fortune or the opposite. You must find him. Hope... he'll help you...promise me. Fine. Good boy... Mom! Damn! ''Next round, 5 dollars, blue side.'' Hold the kid at home. lt's such an easy job. Hey...old man. Why leave so early? l must let you win. Wanna go on? ''Hey, l've brought Bull to Shanhai.'' l thought you'd bring us to department store... and buy some clothes to Bull. Nowwhat can we do? We lose everything. Don't worry. l'm good at gambling. You just bet once more with me and you must win. Then we'll be able to buy clothes... eat meat and ice-cream. ''Dad, l want ice-cream.'' ''What an ambitious guy, Bull.'' You'll be able to talk with all those people... you ate ice-cream in Shanghai. You must feel superior! ''Great...dad, get me to have ice-cream.'' Kid! Kid! Are you dumb? l wanna bet. What're the odds? ''Blue side, 1x1; red side, 1x1.5'' Wait a second. ''Old man, do you have 10 dollars?'' l don't have change. All notes. Don't worry. l must recoup all l lost. And have ice-cream. ''lf you win, l'll tell dad...'' to get you to have ice-cream. ''10 dollars, red side!'' Porky. l'd better hold back. Don't worry. l'll double your capital. You guys are from Fujian? ''Sure. You're from Fujian, too?'' ''Stop quarreling! Villager, take mine first.'' ''10 dollars, all bet on red side.'' l'll give you more if you win. Calm down. Behave decently. You'll get more if you win. Thanks... Master has come. Give way... ''Excuse me, Boss Don.'' ''l'm lucky these days,'' and so l thanked god in the temple... and nowl'm late. ''Master, l must congratulate you.'' You've been working in Shanghai Bund... and finally become rich. Not easy at all. This guy is really god of gamblers. lt must be fun tonight. Are you interested in... betting on who wins the game? Boxing is too simple. No good to bet. And this is your place. l'll lose even ifl win. Smart! What l appreciate you is your wisdom. You must have good brains to survive in Shanghai. lf you think betting on boxing is too simple... then let's... Let's... bet on howmuch money this guy has. ''Hey guy, come here...'' ''Sure, it's you. Come here.'' Howto bet? Bet your right hand... l mean bet the jade ring on your right hand. Sure. Then l bet your left hand... the sliver button on your left sleeve. Suer. You're our guest. Wanna bet single or double? This is too dully. Let's bet on numbers. l guess it's 88. What? l said there're 88 dollars in his pocket. Hey guy. Count howmuch you have. ''Kid, you're so cute.'' When did you put a 10-dollar note in the pocket? Even the uncle god of gamblers... overlooked it. ''Kid, who did you learn such tricks from?'' Have you forgot that l told you... you can't use fake notes? And it's a 10-dollar note. Go tell the old man this way... ''Rock, go check the money.'' ''Boss, this note has no watermark.'' ''Boss, it's not me.'' l took it from a guy. Afat guy. He said he came from the same village as me. Which means you're of a kind. Rocky... Get me the fat guy and fix them! ''Boss, listen to me...'' lt has nothing to do with me. Run! ''We're not of a kind, sir...'' That guy. The one on a hat? You're too cruel. Beat him up! Beat him... You yell like this and he can't even touch you. Who? This 10-dollar note is mine. And it is fake. Wait! lt's a crowd here. You dare beat me? Why not? Beat him up! Wait... What do you wanna do then? Nothing. Just want to yell. Who dropped so much money? Run. Don't move! Freeze! Stay away! Why? Also... Give me! Catch him up! Wait... Catch him up! Wanna run? How do you run? Bro. lt's midnight. Why? Fatty. Can't move? Wait! Playing tricks again? lt fails this time. ''No, bro. Better watch your back.'' Or else l fear of getting you involved. Back? Xiao Long! ''Bro, what's up?'' Watch my back. Watch what? See ifthere's anything here. ''Bro, there're words on the wall...'' and an arrow. Look down! Words and arrow again. Keep on looking down. Understand? What's written? And no arrow at all. Can't read the first 2 characters. You take a look. What the hell? lt's on fire! Run... You sons ofbitches. Just left me alone. ''Fatty, you're awake?'' ''Uncle Yeah, Fat bro's paying the bill.'' Uncle Yeah... Get away! Don't block my way. ''Fatty, if you hadn't met us...'' you wouldn't have become what you are. You gave me medicine? Sure. Feeling touched? ''Come to think ofit, l was hung right up there last night.'' The sons ofbitches didn't save me and l fell down. Then l passed out. Soon l came and saved you. Then l came and prepared the bed for you. Then l came and had a massage for you. ''And me, l sang a song for you to make you sleep.'' ''Girl, how about you?'' You're asking me? l'm waking you up with a feather duster! And my daughter and me as well. We cooked the medicine for you. Thank you so much for all your help. ''To pay you back for your help, l'll invite you over...'' for a meal in French restaurant. Will you go? Bingo! ''Uncle Yeah, l've said earlier before...'' that this guy is very strong.. He must be wealthy sooner or later. Sure! Dine in French restaurant. What an upper-class person! No wonder he's white and plump. This is not plump. This is swelling. Face beaten up and pretend to be plump. lt's edema... An honest person like him... is he such a kind of person? ''Girl, how do you knowl'm honest?'' Now. l'll leave today. l'll send the medical expenses here the next day. And you can come to practice fighting. OK? You're learning martial art? You have such long hair. Howlong have you kept it? Howmuch is a hair-cut? Upper-class? Act like a fool. You gain nothing today! Fatty! You now have a chance to tell the truth. But you still don't wanna treasure it. ''Listen, 3 hours ago, anything about...'' what you have done were all told... by your old villager! Do you know?. Who? Who said that? ''Ling, take Manik here.'' Manik? ''l've checked all the things, Uncle Yeah.'' ''Fatty, listen up.'' Nothing serious in other places. But the main door is out of order. Gotta fix it. OK. So...howmuch is it? l've calculated the cost including labor and material. Not so expensive. Fatty. How old are you? You knowfortune-telling. Tell us ours for free. You can't die before the age of 99. Why? You've made a big trouble. ''97, 98, 99'' What're you counting? Even if he really lives till 99... He still owes 100 dollar at 99. lt doesn't matter. ''Sorry, Uncle Yeah.'' We made the mistake. We didn't do it purposely. l'll pay you back the repair charges. ''Excuse me, but which master are you?'' How do you pay the money? And you dare promise! lt's 500 dollars only. Let's collect it together. And we're gonna borrow some from neighbors. Let's think together. We must resolve it. ls...is that right? Sure! Let's think about it together. ''We can work as volunteers, right?'' l'm finding the neighbors and l'll pursuade them. OK...go... Wait. Me too. Alright. Let's go together. You buy the materials. l still have some money. l'll give you now. OK. lt's crucial to repair the door. Good idea. ''l'm so sorry, Uncle Yeah.'' ''You know, l don't want it...'' Stop pretending! You think l dare not beat you? You dare? You dare... Fatty! What's it all about in the bowl? Good stuff. Drink a bowl today and one more 2 days later. Followwhat l say and you'll heal up completely. Dad. Uncle Yeah didn't say anything. l said something wrong again? Why's your mouth...always faster than your brain? Talk everything without thinking. What? l don't believe Uncle Yeah doesn't let them stay. ''No, Uncle Yeah. My dad means...'' Drink more and you'll heal up faster. He doesn't know anything more than that. l'm right this time. Let's go. Stay for 2 days? That means... l'm living here? Stop nonsense. Drink it. Ask you are Uncle Ye ''ls l do,Ask which has He Guigan'' Yesterday your this was on fire l investigate Asked you to say situation then to me Actually is l is actually such l did not know how did in two building Afterwards did not know how did has caught fire Did not know how did falls down Then did not know how does the corona to the matter was such which he said Has certainly misunderstood That two building that said which as for you l do not knowMy any does not know Uncle Ye ls that as it may you not to dare to say we do not force your We walk Byebye How drank quickly the medicine also has your Wants me to fill your Porky. Don't follow. Get away! Don't leave. Don't force me. l can't do it. How do you knowwithout even trying? ''Ever since l came to Shanghai,'' l've never had any decent job. l'm specially good at this. All kinds... of gambling. l excel in every kind ofthem. And that's all. l can do nothing in other fields. Do you understand? ''No, l don't.'' ''l just know''''Rong Li'''' caught fire but Uncle Yeah didn't blame us.'' And he even let us stay. We owe him too much. Do you think we should look for a decent job? Do you have any conscience?

You look good. What? Can you? Who's the person-in-charge here? Go. They're gonna get angry. ''What you like any help, sir?'' ''l, Rocky...is here to find a person.'' Where is the fat guy and the one who sells tickets? Hand them out or you'll suffer! What are you talking about? ''There're 2 troublemakers here, though.'' ''Don't scare me, kid.'' ''ln front of me, you're nothing!'' l say once more only. We don't have such guys here. You go. ''Lady, do you know...'' what's the influence of offending Master? You'd better get them here. Otherwise we'll take action. We're not ordinary people. ''lf you aggravate me, you have no chance to regret.'' Seems they like to get punished. Action! Go! Who say first? ''Master, l have guys...'' searching for those 2 bastards. But we have some troubles. Troubles? ''Yes, Master. Who doesn't know...'' your status here? ''But in this ''''Rong Li'''' building...'' there's a pawn who takes you as nothing. ''Master, don't need to angry, though.'' l've already taught them a lesson. Nowyou got hurt like this. This is called a lesson. Not bad. This is what Master should do. Anything...can't be hidden from you. ''However, there's one thing you don't know.'' ''The guys in ''''Rong Li''''...'' got beaten up more seriously. Are you that powerful? Just tell me. Master. Some 10 guys of us... ''went to ''''Rong Li'''' to catch them.'' They got frightened... just as we stared at them. ''But when we mentioned Master,'' about 20 to 30 guys rushed out... and stood round us. We surely meet head-on. They had much more guys... ''and they brought with them weapons,'' But we're elites ofMaster. We can never let Master lose face! Devil-Claw showed his ultimate power to beat 4. With his invincible devil claws... he beat the guys like playing... and took their weapons in no time. lron-Head was greater. ''For the sake of saving his own guys,'' he sacrificed himself... and fought more than 10 guys at a time. His head was broken and his hair was gone. What a devoted man! Something more than that. Green and Red bros were even greater. A bare-handed guy... fought 6 or 7 guys with broadswords. ''After 100 rounds,'' ''they were hit with numberless slashes,'' but all the enemies fell. Bold and powerful! And Panther. He brought his animality into full play. We could never count his moves... even with more than 100 abacuses. ''There was chaos in such an environment,'' but you clearly stated everyone's situation? What were you doing? ''Master, everyone was in danger.'' l jumped up on the table and watched them. What? You have fear of heights? So that l looked through everything... then l could give them orders. Otherwise we couldn't... achieve such a triumph! Yep! We didn't have a lot of guys. But we beard one thing in mind... that we are with Master. Yep! And we had a glorious victory! Softer... We did eliminate the enemies! Yup! ''You said ''''Rong Li'''' was turned upside down.'' Where're the guys? ''Master, we almost did it.'' lt's all because of fate. lf... ifthe police hadn't come... we must have kicking their asses. Right? Sure... Really? Nowthat they're losers. Do you mean that it's not late to catch them later? Sure... Right? They can't hide for the rest oftheir lives. You mean it? Right? l'm telling the truth. We can't act too hastily for now. We gotta wait for our guys to heal up... ''before we root out ''''Rong Li''''.'' Do you mean it? What? How's your business today? Leave it alone. l'll treat you to wonton. You've shitted for so many times? Not a few. A shop in 8-mile Lane is famous for roast chicken. A restaurant in South Gate is also a good choice. Let's eat wonton. Go. Wait. l still have things to say. The 3rd shop on the left of main road... sells marvelous hog hoof! ''Ladies and gentlemen,'' ''we now have the pillar of Golden Era,'' ''Miss Goldie, to perform here.'' ''Miss Goldie, please!'' Don't push... What're you doing? l'll return blowfor blow. l am here. You fatty. Doing business in our place? How do you...pay for it? ls the street named after you? Who knows it's you? You knowwhat are called rules? All places belong to Master in the street. You wanna make trouble? You're not the same as those workers. Why come? Looking for troubles? What the hell do you want? Stop being rude! No need to talk. Go teach them! No! ''Manik, how did you do that?'' Do what? You have magical power. l feel that you're far more powerful than others. l don't know. How could you lift such a big car? Do you have some magical power? l don't have magical power. You can't hide any secret. l see them all. l fight by thinking. ''Lu Bu, why do you pretend to be a monkey?'' ''Master, where had you gone?'' l tried so hard to find you. Lu Bu. You patricide. You betrayer. You will die by my Green Dragon Crescent Blade. You evildoer. Dare enter my master's body? Look at my stick! Stop running... Don't run! Spectacular! What're you doing? What're you doing? ''Willow, what's happening?'' l don't know either. Are they haunted? l don't know. He was normal before having the meal. l'll do it. Hand it to me. Doctor! Coming! Eat it! Eat it... ''Ling, do you need help?'' Why're you so late? You dare hit your dad? Why're you holding...scissors? Fatty. Wanna have your hair cut? No. Help... They must have been poisoned. Nothing else would make it happen. lmpossible. All they ate are from our own kitchen. The problem's not with the dishes. lt's all with the steamed buns bought somewhere. They ate them and soon got poisoned. Seems it was Sam Cho's deed. lt's OK ifthey're fine. All in a mess. Stop laughing! Go get things packed! Why have you stopped? l've finally found a table without a chopstick bucket. Sure... See howwell l've arranged it. Everyone's busy and you're just holding a bucket? ''lt's rather heavy, to be honest.'' Done. ''Ling, you can't stand a lot. l'll give you less.'' ''Come on, you have more wine.'' Don't snatch. Everyone has the wine. Come on. Cheers! Cheers! l'm going upstairs. One more cup. ''Uncle Yeah, the money is for you.'' l'm not your dad. You're even better than my dad. l'm going down. ''Miss, he's come.'' Thank you very much. Hi! Peter! Hi! Welcome! Boss Don! Good to see you here. l almost forget to give this to you. Thank you! Don't open it now. You'd better... go. l'll wait for you at home. OK? Do you knowwhat day it is? ''Hey guy, come here.'' Move calmly. ''Miss, what's wrong with you?'' Don't cry like this on the street... or everybody sees it. Did anyone bully you? You liar! You always say you're busy. You always say you have things to do. But do you know howl feel? You have many women around you... then who am l? Do you knowwhat day it is? Today is my birthday. Why do you let me down? l just hope you can hold me. Hope you can stay with me. But why can't you do all these simple things? Wake up... Miss...wake up! Who do you think l am? l hate you! Sorry. l didn't mean to do it. Doesn't matter. lt's not the first time l got beaten. ''You, come up.'' Come up! Are you hurt? lt's turned red. lt's nothing. l'll better send you home. l don't wanna go home now. So... You gotta get me to a place... which makes me happy. Maybe it's not a good idea. You don't knowme. ''By the way, l still don't knowyour name.'' What's your name? l'm Manik. Full of power. So l work as a rickshawpuller. What about you? Call me Goldie. Nowwe know each other. We can go. Thank you. Sit well. Let's go! The smell's great here. When l was a kid... l lived in this kind of environment. l've never thought ofit. l miss those days when l... lived happily without anything to worry about. Nowl'm grown up. l have wealthy live and a high-class job. But l think a lot more than ever. lt's good to lead a simple life like you. Delicious. Manik. You sound like... you're not a local person. Why do you come to Shanghai? To find my dad? Alone? Sure. Where's your mom? She passed away. Sorry. lt's OK. lt's in the past. ''l may not find my dad, though.'' l never ever saw his face. You said you never see him... so how do you find him? Especially in Shanghai. My mom told me that l am... powerful as him. So l'm working for a boxing center... as a rickshawpuller. See ifl'm lucky enough. But...he's a needle in a haystack lf you find him some day... what would you talk to him? Nothing good to say. lfl have to... l'd ask him why he left us alone. Perhaps... l'd ask nothing at all. l have a feeling that... you must make it. Manik. Nice to meet you. l'm so happy today. Thank you. See you. See you. Manik. Find me in Golden Era if you need help. ''l'm Prince Flower, god of gamblers' representative.'' l'm here specially for celebrating your birthday. Don! You bastard! Bastard... Happy birthday. young sits l think ln your heart has to tie you to want to untie it to My untold hardships come to Shanghai Only is wants to look for my father But ''But is contrary to what expects Arab League strength,ALi'' Your also young You must know Has very many matters is not grasping in own hand The good fortune makes human why too rigid Crossed this to live calmly and steadily Even if good Moreover you found your father He also could not help your l urge you to go back Again do not keep place which this seeks fame and fortune You must remember my speech ls the luck is not? ls the calamity hides Goes back Perhaps your father he was no longer living l got a young pretty gal last night. We had been talking happily. ''And finally, she gave me 10 more cents.'' ''l'm fat, but l'm handsome.'' l took more advangate after all. Sure. Took more advantage... Get lost! Who are you? Shitty fatty. You can't leave now. Beat him up! Not hit... Beat him to death! Wait... The same move. Go! Fatty. Watch out. You dare aggravate me? ''Come on, let's be pals.'' Have some tea... How did you turn that somersault? Pretty. Stop playing! Don't haste. They each took a few 10 cents from me. Nowthey're with me. Why did you make it so complicated? You jerks. Your minds get changed so fast. l risked my life out there but you kept staying here. Beat them! Stop it! Bring them away. Yes! Go! l've got no freedom. Tears shed ceaselessly. l stand for boss Sam to bail his guy out. Set him free. ''Rocky, have you done the things?'' ''Master, l called for three masters.'' ''We must solve the problem of''''Rong Li'''''' You guys are agile and powerful. ''l'll let you watch ''''Rong Li''''.'' Damn. The 2 goldfishes are dead. Don't need to fuss. The death only means l'm powerful. l'll control all the places! ''Got it, Master.'' Ching. l miss you so much. Ching... Take care. Don Ching. Remember. l love you. ''Boss Don, you're finally here.'' l feared if you were scared...and dare not come. l'm not interested in bloody battles. Do you think...you'll win just because you're brave? This is what god of gamblers does. Always staying calm. ''God of gambler, l wanna tell you,'' after tonight... l'll miss you so much. ''Miss Miko, Mr. Don Ching.'' The one who gets the best of 3 sets is the winner. Do you agree with it? Sure. ''Mr, Don. Your reputation is great.'' There're great gamblers around the world. lt's precious to play with you. lt's my pleasure. The match nowbegins. ''Round 1, Fan-Tan.'' ''Master, after today...'' you'll be the master of Shanghai. Then you must forget me. lt's so kind of you. How can l...forget you? l bet on 4. ''Round 1, Miss Miko wins.'' ''Miss Miko, have you ever thought...'' what you'd get if you win? And what's your loss if you lose the game? ''l must win today, otherwise...'' l'll the club l've run for half of my life. ''Therefore, l'm sorry.'' ''Round 2, Pai Gow.'' Miss Miko first. l'll shuffle this way. Look at this arrangement. ''Round 2, Mr. Don wins.'' ''Round 3, ShowHand.'' Get up! Don't sleep! Open the door! lt catches fire! lt catches fire... Don't run! l don't wanna die...l don't have a wife yet... Damn. Why spreading so fast? Do you have something to lend me? l could be pried open... What're you standing there for? Help me... What can l do... ''Round 3, l must win.'' Tomorrow... Golden Era will belong to me. ''With Mr. Don's skills,'' why had he lose round 1? ''Honestly, l just wanted to...'' try my luck and your real power. And l'm hoping to see... Miss Miko's ShowHand skills. The skill of god of gambler... is really miraculous. l can't compare with you. Your ShowHand skill is pretty great. Very refreshing. l don't want you to get involved in it. lt's our private matters. ''Alright, Don Ching.'' What the hell're you doing? Make the decision! Does Master knowwhy l like to put on... black suit and black tie? How do l know?. ''Coz every round, to me, is so meaningful.'' l was just like a musician long waiting for performance. But soon l found that l didn't care ifl won. Winning or losing is not important to me at all. But then l had another vice. ''l like to see others lose,'' especially those who never thought they'd lose. lt highly delights me. Sam Cho. ''Today, l'll bet all my wealth...'' on all your places in Nan Jing Road. lf you wanna see my hand...go on. Goldie... Stand it. l'll bring you to the hospital. lt's a surprise that a renowned guy like Don... has ended this way. lt's all my fault. ''lfl hadn't fought, l wouldn't have got caught.'' l would've protected Goldie. Let it go. You can't bring her back to life. Why can good people not live well? Things like this always happen in the world. ''lf good people live well and bad guys suffer,'' the world would be peaceful. Don't blame yourself. Gotta blame that bastard Sam Cho. ''Don's not a good man, either.'' A singing girl following him won't come to a good end. She should've thought oftoday. Right? l think l'm right. ln places like Shanghai... either you die or l die. Are you enough? Go to hell... Where have all your conscience gone? You cold-blooded man! They're also humans... why're you so cruel and ruthless? Howinhuman! l'm inhuman? Alright! Let me tell you a story. lt was my pal's story... Tell him l've left if you see him. Enjoy it. Fried bread stick. Soybean milk. Serve while still hot. Howmuch? One dollar. l'm not moving this way. ''Manik, are you looking for me? What's up?'' What's wrong with you? You...are you Ma Xiao Long? l've finally found you! Ma Xiao Long! ''Manik, calm down.'' You're my dad? ''Manik, calm down for a while.'' Do you want to recognize me? You're not Uncle Yeah. You are Ma Xiao Long! ''Come on, calm down.'' You hide here coz you fear ofbeing revenged on. Do you know?. Mom died because of you! Take it easy. ln all these years... mom had been missing you. Do you ever know?. Manik... Why do you not recognize me? Why! l'll get angry... You timid. You're not qualified to be my father... You scum! ''Manik, he left because he had no way out.'' you and he got supreme power in your bodies. Your dad had already lost too many things... so as to control the power. So... So... So he... ''Manik, l don't wanna explain too much.'' Take today's things as nothing happened. You'll understand some day. Listen to me. Go... Go...good boy. Hurry up. Run! Watch out. Are you OK? ''Daughter, stand it.'' Manik! Go! Mom! Leave me alone. l don't need your care. ''Nick, don't go!'' Let me go! You wanna go to die? Where do they come from? lt looks they're top kung fu masters. l'm gonna save Willow! Lock him up! ''Manik, stay calm!'' My turn! You stay here and watch Manik. Who the heck are you? Don't either look like a human or a ghost. Why do you bully kids? Let me out! Fine. l'll finish you old man. No daydreaming! ''Seer, run! Now!'' ''Wizard, are you OK?'' Come let me out! Don't blame dad... Wizard... Wizard! Doctor. l...l can't move it anymore. Let me out! Howtough. Once again. The stance...is so stable. Lucky that my fingers're not broken. Stop fighting! You're exhausted! Let me tell you a story. A story of my friend. Last time the police station caught fire. He suddenly went mad and attacked everyone. ''With his great power, he was so cruel.'' He could even bend the iron fence. l thought he would come and save me... but l was wrong. He was unconscious and became a different person. He became a devil. So l pretended to be dead. l thought he wouldn't hurt all people. He is the most person l've ever seen. ''When l first met him, the place was also on fire.'' He was equally cruel. Uncle Yeah risked his life to make him stop... but actually could do nothing. l wanted to tell him but a blind man stopped me. lt was useless to tell him. He couldn't control himself. We could only see him destroy himself. Tell him if you see him. ''What l think is right, guy.'' Managing the potential is the best skill ever. Hope you'd further develop martial arts. ''Manik, l...'' l'm so sorry! ''Manik, you now understand it.'' Your dad couldn't control the force... that he'd go mad every time he sees fire. He could only make himselfblind. He doesn't want you to follow his destiny. ''But he can't help you, can he?'' lt's good news you can take it under control. ''Forgive him, OK?'' Forgive him. lt's hard for him to do that. ''Manik, forgive him.'' Forgive your dad. Things were passed long ago. Alright...help your dad up. Don't block my way. Dad! Fine...good ending. ''Willow, are you OK?'' Sure. l'm fine. l can still hold the teapot.
