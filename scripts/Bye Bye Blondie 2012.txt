Do you think that you are ugly? No. If you do not think you are ugly, Why do you feel when uglier? Is that why I'm locked up here? You do not like my appearance? Young girls who feel pretty don't cut their hair like savages. They do... if they're punks. I'm punk. Having problems with sex? No, I do not think ... I usually do not talk about it with people I do not know. 'I regard myself as normal. -Normal? I think that it is normal not wanting to talk about it with one - I do not know, I have not asked for. I do not tell if I swallow When I suck someone. It is normal. I will consult with parents. Shall I wait outside? Gloria? Come with me. We're not saying you're crazy but that you expose yourself to danger- -In a disturbing way. I do not belong here. Do something, You can not leave me here. We will not hurt you.

Dad ...! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Train number 2534 - -From Nancy arrives. Is it? -Should I take your bag? -Yes. The car is there. -Do you have any coins or notes? -Come! -He must not remain here. -A charming reception. Do you take your bag? -Have you shared port phone? -Yes. We have shared apartment ... - ... But not the same floor. -So we do not meet your husband? -No. -If someone visits me ... Calling it ... with him, too. For a life. You sound in the hallway.

Yeah, I'm calm. -Calm down! -Do not touch me! Fat Cow! This is what happens if you touch my stuff. Fat Cow! -Stop it! -Stop staring! Next time I mosses you! I saw you fighting for Beru yesterday. I've never seen someone go on like that. -When did you come? -Yesterday. Why are you here? -For amnesia. I took a lot of Rohypnol, and has lost his memory. What more do you listen to, except on Beru? -Do you know Beru? -Yes, I do. -Do you take me for an idiot or what? -Yes. My idol is David Bowie. I also like the beer, punk And I love the Stooges. Not bad. You remember many groups to have lost his memory? Can you keep a secret? -My name is Frances. -Gloria. Gloria ... I remembered it all this morning. I did not say something so as not to be let out immediately. This is not a fun place. Be all you can do. -It is difficult to get here. -I wanted to get to know you. Then you have not lost your memory, you're just crazy. Shall we smoke? Are you hippie, or Do you think that you're in "Little House on the Prairie"? -Treat me like a fool, then. -Now you have destroyed all my therapy. -Do you smoke cigarettes? -Yes. I have some hash ... Shall we join forces? -How do you have so many cigarettes? -I bought them from Pierrot yesterday. -I do not talk with anyone. -Is it a matter of principle? No, a matter of taste. -How is your friend, Pierrot? He is sympathetic, little absent, but kind. He believes that he is persecuted, and that he can read people's minds. He says he's filmed by the state. First I've heard, but you never know. He said that people pursue him when he is in the swimming hall- And that the bank where he worked sent medieval codes to him. Then it was best to leave. I can see them, their petty madness. I do not want to talk to a banker who also is disabled. -I am too young. Daddy works in a bank. Is that depressing? -I do not talk to your dad. Do you know that according to the rules get patients do not fuck with each other? -It inhibits recovery. -Really? I like what you say, for I will never recover. You work all week and lets loose the whole weekend The little waiter at McDonalds says she lives on Sonacotra. There is freedom there. She has right in. She works during the week and at the weekend dances. -Wait ... I found amphetamines. -No? How did you find them? Leave the door unlocked, or they'll discover us. Alright ... We did that in church ... You went to church as a kid? Not so often. Close your mouth. So lucky that you are here. I'll always be your baby I will always be here. Hi, Marjorie! How are you? Hi, Frances. Who is she? -Maid. What's she doing here with you? -Wash. -You don't? -No. -What does she gets paid? -15 Euros a week, three hours per day. A wealth. Give it to me. We don't care about washing. I work somewhere else. I'm late, too. Inhale deeply through your nose ... and as we breathe out ... We breathe out ... We support with hand and stretches out ... Bra. One, two, three, four and five. It is not healthy to exercise, especially sober. It's like drugs. It is believed that it helps, but it's a trap. -Are you working all day? -Yes. Are you here when I come? I'll get the keys to you. What is the use of money if you work all day? It hangs together. So disappointed I become. Is it like to be rich? -Can I create a cottage here with you? -A cottage? -A corner is mine. Yeah ... obviously. Toulouse seemed to want to leave dinner when I got without you. He is sincere. He does not hide his disappointment. If we pay ...? As nice. No, let me ... -Let's see ... Here you are. -What will you do this weekend? We could go to Cabourg to get some Iuft. -So maybe I can write IittIe. -Do you still have writer's block? If I have ... I've written ten lines, that's all. I sit for hours at the office. It is hell. Edouard can drive us for your recording on Friday. No, it's Gloria's first weekend here. I will be here with her. Yeah? What are you? Listening to "La Souris deglingue ... - ... In Bruriers farewell concert. -Please! Give me respite! What will she do when you get to sense and throws her out? It's different with her. -I give it two weeks. May I ... Le Monde. So bad that you are there. I do not know if you get my letters- Or if they read them. They can go to hell. When we were together it was almost comical that you were there. Now that I'm back and you are still there, I am insane. I tremble at the thought of how we should kiss when you come out. Call me when you get home! I place the dormitory. I'm out when you get here. Just wait and see ... I'm home with my albums and my room ... and your letters. I was not one of them. I was sad when you left home. So boring that you stay with nuns it may not be as fun. There is certainly much disobedience there ... I will not see you again. I have my life here. My boyfriend will reunite and I will be with him. What the hell? Is that real blood? -If you can not scream as usual? -There is no danger. -The skinheads beat me. -We turn them in his mouth. -We take revenge on them! -We turn the skulls on them! -Look, skinheads! Where are you? Where are you, you skinheads? There is nobody here. Cops! Police! Stop! Damn, for some strenuous pigs. So you tell me during the fight? You are not exactly awake. -What do you do with those bastards? -They are comrades from Toulouse. It was your buddies who fucked with us. He was alone and drunk, but did not stop until we caught up. You should not hang with the fascists, kid. You can get bad. Stop calling me "kid" ... Why not? -Do you live with your parents? -No. I would not end up in a madhouse again. I'm staying with a friend. His parents don't know I jump through the window. Is that ok in your home? -It was exhausting, but it's ok. -I'm waiting for answers to my letters. -Really? -Cried a lot? -Yes. How long have you suffered ... Two weeks? Will you stay with me? I live nearby. You don't have to climb into, I have a separate entrance. No, I don't want to. I know you're scared, girl. One can get anxiety from Meeting the woman in her life. Relax, you would like to be happy. You are still a big mouth. Hold up, I'm not going. If you open the trunk? Careful. They are sharp ... They scratched the trunk. -Not if you put them gently. -What will you do with them? -My own corner. -It's not olive oil? No, but set them up and down. Set them straight! -Good day, madam! -Good day. I live on the fourth, if you need anything. -Yes, sir, thank you! -See you. Hello! Hello! Is that you playing so loud? -Gloria, I presume. Nice to meet you. It is I who is Claude Muir. We will certainly stay together All three, in peaceful coexistence. I interrupt you right away I am the alpha male here. I just wanted to say that you play too loud. -You get to hear at lower volumes. -I am a writer. And I have writer's block. It is hard to imagine. The easiest thing would have been not to write then. I avail myself of a ritual, of self-hypnosis - -A kind of temporary psychosis which is favorable for creating. Do you understand? Music is essential of ending up in the state. I have to find the right mood. Nothing can disturb the process. -That's it. -I satisfied myself. Thank you. -Are you okay? -Yes. Can I check my mail? Mann would think that a serial killer lives here. Thank you for your compliment. Will it work between us this time? I will not let you, Gloria. This time I will not have you. Do not bite me. -Your fucking bitch. What? When I think of the letter you wrote. The only letter I got from you. I did not think you were a coup. I thought you would taste better. I had not thought me sleeping with girls. But I was wrong ... Then I had not tasted your buttocks. You totally screwed me. I was absolutely desperate. You are not heterosexual reason. You like to suffer. Relax. I understand, you'll suffer. Hold UP! So do not you like we met at the wrong house. Are not you tired of playing psychologist? Can not get enough? Gloria. -What does your boyfriend feel about this? -Which girlfriend? I have no girlfriend ... You are my girlfriend. -Hussy. Oh, I missed this. -They are actually a little bit mine. No, not at all. Hey ... leopard! -You're all full. Calm down! -You get me 12, so we go. -Is Frances sour? We would go to London for ... going to concerts and buying records. -Don't forget my records! -If I go ... She has learned she must study all summer- -With an extra teacher To get into the fine schools. -What is an extra teacher? -An extra teacher with the rich ... - ... Help her better grades. -Does she not have good enough grades? -Never! It will not even have! -For a skull! No, we cut out. Frances! Are you hiding? Frances! What is it ...? You? Excuse me. I would not make you sad. You pass the well ... I work -So we can go to London. Now you say that we can not go. Then I'm sorry. -We do not care about your parents. -Stop, that's enough. You never cease to sulk! -I do not care, I suck all. -Calm down, Hezbollah. You'll have to choose then ... Choosing between parents and me. They will not like that you are gay, so that you're with me ... I am sorry not to be able to go. What should I do, kill my mom? It might be better than to spend the summer with the teacher. Aside from girls like you are out unable to go against your mother. Life is rock 'n roll. With you rocker life as in a Darty commercials. You're crazy. -We escaping. Yeah, absolutely. -Fuck the fine schools. -Would you be avokat? -Lawyer, yes. -It's called a lawyer. -They say well not a lawyer? To escape had been smart. So would my parents never let me be. I'm talking about escape and you are all back home. The motto is "No Future" not think to secure pension. Shut up! Kiss me! Kiss me! -You know you can not resist me. -No! Kiss me! -How can you let her do it? She needs space. You get a little baffled in beginning, but one gets used. To request home people what do you do? I said that my friend the artist do an installation at me. -You, then? How is the novel? 'I listen to music in headphones. It's not the best method for creative hypnosis. It affects the rhythm of my writing. I think she has ruined my style. It does nothing, think you, - -Since I can not write. You know she's crazy? Who? -The second. No, she is a punk rocker. -Punk Rocker? Yes ... That's what I like. -Punk Rocker ... I dream. -How so? A fierce wild boar had been more sophisticated. When you waive two week recordings because she has burst- -Eyebrow because you have contradicted her. Then she tried to communicate a little bit with you. I'm worried about you. What is it with you? I can not make multiple applications next year. That's the rumor. They want me in a dokuspe where I put the kids on tractors. Is there tractors, Gloria may be in the casting. What it says in the contract? What does your lawyer? I'll wait until it's a fact. It'll be ... Count on me. We are warriors, you and me. That's why we are who we are. -Yes. The document open ... Why not? Yes ... -Unger on the tractor in the city can work. It's pathetic. What we meant shamelessly five years ago ... - ... Seems completely normal today. -Yes. Excuse me. -What's this? -Position to build on the hill. Since we never go out suitable I get to the creative activity. As Zezette in "Santa Claus is a bastard." Right. Lucky I did not have a gun. Why are you so aggressive towards me? -I am not. When I get there, highlight the difference. I'll go to my producer's party to have a chat with him. -Does it bother you about Claude with me? -Yeah, it bothers me so into hell. In two weeks we have not gone out once together. You are afraid to be seen with a girl if people start talking. Why do you care? You do not know anyone there. Claude can find out who are on time for something is afoot. Is Claude rich since you're sucking up like that? No, he is the author. When you gain nothing. He fucks you not, he's boring and has writer's block ... What do you do with him? I begin to wonder what I'm doing here. I know, Gloria ... It's so don't assume that I'm gay. It would be easier not to pretend as if I were heterosexual, like you. Without marriage I would not be where I am. Our love is small, weak and ashamed. You let it grow. Light and ashamed? You are wrong. It is of hardened steel. Nothing can shake it. -Not mine at least. You're sexy. -What are instant art? Can each guest say a word? -Any? -Future. Future gets an "E". We asked for a no and got a yes. We hear on a small piece, and come back to our guests. -Now we hear our chronicler ... Was that a piece of music? On ... Modern Art: Hlne Soult, be my guest! Good evening ... Alexander van Groik, were contemporaries of Vermeer ... Painted women ... in everyday life. -With us, princess ... -Wait, I want to see in the distance. Take out credentials! Show them! -They were stolen in Montauban. -What did you do there? She visited relatives. -I have confirmation here. Where does the money come from? Robber you older? No, I like older. All join in! When we go! Stir in the legs! When we go! The first to be freed waiting on the other, ok? -Now hold it! -I have been here for two days. -Tell me where she is. -I do not give out personal information. It's illegal. -Has she released? -Enough. Go! That's my buddy! I worry for her. Have you strangled her, or what? What are you looking for? Shall we check On your paper is also fake? Will you end up in the cage? Let the girl be! Let her be! You are a real accident! It is you who is an accident. Fuck you. Gloria! Listen to this ... "We've had a great time together - -But we must be clear-sighted. I can not risking my future. " How can she write like that? It's probably not her who have wanted to write this letter. I do not understand ... how can she leave me? So she writes ... It hurts to write this - -But I hope you understand that our paths must part. " How can I understand it ...? How should I understand? -How will I live without her? Come on, Gloria! -Stop whining, Gloria! -Frances was not for you! Stop crying. Go to hell! You look stunning, babe. -You then. Good evening! Is everything all right? Can we talk? Frances ... Did you spend my On prostitute? Yeah ... Hello! -I like them rock hard. -You must have them. Hey, Jean-Baptiste! -Jean-Baptiste, Producer - Gloria. -Are you a childhood friend? I would like to chat with you. I've heard some rumors. -Am I not program host next year? -Ugh, that's just nonsense. The program is a success. Why should I change it? -There are rumors about a certain replaces -We have known each other for ten years. Would I do that to you? Be calm. I will keep you informed. It's clean grass ... I smoke only it since I quit using tobacco. Let me see ... What is it? She does not know, she's dumb. -You don't do french fries? Jaha ... All idiots has made himself. Hey! Is everything all right? -Yes. Have you met Csar? Have you been on holiday? Surprise ... My dear. What are you doing here? I'm here to see you. We do not support communitarianism, or follow an American model. What's the point to close himself in his own little world? Can you keep up? Did you hear how you sound? -Your stupid oversight, too. -I will not allow ... I do not care what you allow. You and your wife can go to hell! No ...! Are you crazy! -Excuse me, cow. -Poor man. Away with you ... You're not even worth a bang. No, stay here. You ruin everything. Where did Frances find her, Animal Friends? Pitbull Bitch. I should take her. -Are you going already? -I have had enough of the small talk. -Have a nice evening. -Frances, then? Gloria! I just have to say that you are my idol. What you did was right, powerful and disruptive. You drive a motorcycle ...? I will go to the gig. Drive me? Yes, anywhere you want. -Do you have more grass? -Absolutely. -You never do that! -You take me to the party ... - ... And go with your husband! What was good for the outbreak? -What do I say to them tomorrow? -How can I live with you? Is it because I'm on TV I have this job? That I have stability ... that you treat me like this? What are you talking about? -The poor victim. Poor Gloria! But one has to create a life. You have to build up your life show some effort, have some courage! You have not built up any whatsoever! Violence is a brainwashing language. It impresses only idiots! It is you who is responsible for the violence, Frances. -Do not touch me! -You live with sick people. You lie every time you open your mouth. I do not know you. Take the keys. Plug and dig down! Go and fuck them! Come on! Do it, Gloria. When we have a little fun? They know how to enjoy themselves. They are not wasting time. When do we have fun? When do we laugh together? I've had enough of your Office Hours and priorities. Now leave. It's over. Get out! Leave! I'm leaving when I decide! not when someone says that to me! -So pathetic you are. -Pathetic? Just the word I was looking for: pathetic. Frances? What are you doing there? I saw that you came home alone. Are you still up? You had to right that it didn't last two weeks even. It is over. I had forgotten the feeling there, there ... there. I was so afraid that you would leave me when she came ... ... Until tonight. When I held you tight I felt I had lost you. What we have in common doesn't interest you anymore. She is a beast and dangerous to the public, that girl. But it is her you need. What will you do about it? Is it Gloria you're talking about, or do I dream? You're going to lose everything that you stand for ... But ... it does not matter. You, then ... and your novel? Not a word, not a line ... I'm done. But I will also accept this. I'll change lives. I will be leaving town and put the writing behind me. I think of Brittany ... maybe open a creperie with Csar. A crperie ... yes ... Csar would fit in a crperie. She replaces FRANCES MUIR -Will you be ok? -It only hurts when I breathe. You can be with me today. I'm not working. No, leaving after the first fight. If it goes to hell, it is not something to do. But it was good, too. It had not lasted long. Thank you, everyone! Thank you, Frances! Remove the guests their miking, thanks! -Shall we go? I'm coming. I expected it. You warned me. -What will you do now? -Take me along. You give me my purse? -Take a little vacation with your girlfriend! -Is this your makeup? -No. -Then I'll take it. I would've told you right away but Jean-Baptiste would not let. It was not the end of the world. You can't be sitting in the box all my life. Excuses! I'll go to Jean-Baptiste. We have to cover the rest of season. Hlne replaces you. -Could you not have waited the year out? -Then I would also be fired. And to warn me was too hard? -I also have the day ... ... When I find my stuff in a box outside my office. -That's it, we're no angels. -You think that you have friends ... ... Which says that the rumors are incorrect, then lets one see it on the street. It's not personal, that's how it goes. I must go ... See you soon and we'll talk about the future, ok? -Relax. I'll help you. -You, Jean-Baptiste! What happened? -Come! Come here! Here! Frances! Frances! How much regret not when it is too late. When one remembers the last time- -Before it loses a few ounces soul. How heavily does not weigh the that is strangled to please others. To arouse desire in others. To show all the time that was laid down ... in vain. Rasedyr, beautifully disciplined ... She had never severed ties to childhood, - -The wild and carefree. They were an oath to each other. The framework had changed, Figures released another ... But it never came between them. Here she comes. You go. She's yours. I'm embarrassed by what is happening. I do not recognize anything. As if no one has hurt me. I am innocent of everything I do. I'm not afraid of you. You will get everything that is needed. I'm not afraid to let you in, nothing with you scares me. At the last breath, what really counts? The proof of desire, happiness of being together ... -A sunspot on the skin ... Now we go home. An exchange of words ... For once she was full. Bodies subsisting on the other's breath. She would no longer fight against it. She went her way. She lost everything, and she found himself.
