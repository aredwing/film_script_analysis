You know what he did. He was a hero. The vast majority of New Orleans, Louisiana, is underwater. Tens of thousands of homes and businesses are beyond repair. We're dealing with one of the worst natural disasters in out nation's history. The mayor, Ray Nagin, has ordered almost every one of the city's 1500 police officers to leave their search and rescue mission and return to the streets to stop people from taking goods from stores and businesses. Jesus. Is that Kenny? Yeah. What the hell was your partner doing here? I don't know. We got separated a couple days ago. I've been down in the 9th Ward since it hit. People are trapped in there like rats. They never got half of them out before the flood waters rose. What? Come on, help me. Your late partner, Mr. Kenny Cowlings... What? - Was he...? - Was he what? You tell me. Was he dirty? Ma'am, if Kenny was dirty, I would have killed him. Mm-hmm. I've got a floater. I'm gonna need some pickup. All looters will be shot. Get away from the store. All looters will be shot. Stupid motherfucker, you can't even carry that TV. Freeze! - Let's get the fuck out of here. What the fuck? Metro PD. What the fuck are you doing? - Stand down. - Get your ass down from there. I'm just doing my job. - Stand down. - You get your ass down off that roof. Come in here and clean your mess up. We're all in this shit together. What the fuck is the matter with you? - Get off the roof. - Stand down. I will not. You stand down. I'm just doing my job. You get your ass down from there. No, I will not. You do your job. - You just shot that man for no reason. - He deserved it. - Hey. - Stan Johnson, 5th Ward. - You a cop? - Private security. - He ain't no cop. - I got this. You a cop killer? You're pointing your gun at an officer. Put that gun down. - Stand down. - Put it down. - Andy Deveraux. - Nice to meet you. Stan Johnson. - Where's your partner? - He left when the water got deep? Yeah, mine stayed. - Where are you from? - Chicago. I just transferred. Lucky you. Yeah, right? Lucky me. That guy shot that man for no reason. The Big Easy ain't so easy anymore. As the ferocious hurricane Katrina drew a bead on their precariously sited city and suburbs, metropolitan New Orleans residents prayed for salvation... The death toll from Hurricane Katrina continues to climb dramatically. Entire communities have been wiped out. And residents of New Orleans are now being told they may not be able to return to what's left of their city for months. The number of dead in the devastated city could well be into the thousands. Conditions continue to deteriorate after two levies broke sending water coursing through the streets. An estimated 80% of the city which lies below sea level is underwater... We are facing a storm that most of us have feared. I do not want to create panic, but I do want the citizens to understand that this is very serious. That's why we've taken this unprecedented move. Every person is hereby ordered to immediately evacuate the City of New Orleans. Truckloads of water, ice, meals, medical supplies, generators, tents and tarpaulins. There are currently over 1700 trailer trucks which have been mobilized to move these supplies into position. The Coast Guard has worked heroically for the last 48 hours, rescuing or assisting well more than 1000 people who were in distress and held high and dry above the flood waters. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is scrambling to find temporary housing for tens of thousands of people, to rescue people stranded on roofs in the now uninhabitable Super Dome. This recovery will take a long time. This recovery will take years. In some cases violence has broken out as people looted stores. Several businesses report having their entire stock of guns and other weapons taken. And police officials report armed gangs roaming the streets. - Hey, what up, coz. - Hey, coz, how are you doing, man? - Yeah, go ahead in that there. - Yeah, keeping it real. - Man, what's up? - Yeah yeah, what up, coz? What's up, man? You got some new chompers on you, coz. - Morning. Hey, coz, you got what I need? Yeah, baby. Hey, babe. It's the Latin Kings! Hey y'all, grab your shit. It's the Latin Kings! Fuck, Chamorro. Are we through? No, sir, we're not. You have a new partner now. Do you trust him? Starting to. Look at this. Two joints tops. A bunch of wannabes. Been out there all day. Oh, not this asshole. - Whoa. Welcome to my park. This shit will get you hot for real, no joke. - Nice. Thanks, man. - Y'all are welcome back anytime. - Thanks. - Yeah, appreciate it. Freeze. Narcotics. - What did I do, man? - Hands behind your head. Turn around. I just want to talk to you. Shit, man. Oh, look what we got here, Stan. What's a punk like you doing with a SIG Sauer? Ooh, a fancy gun. Got an ID, killer? No, I don't have an ID. - How about a name, asshole? - My boys call me George Carter, man. Shut up. I know this punk. His name is Downey Little. What are you doing in my park? You know me... no walking on the grass, no pissing on the trees and no dealing. Okay okay, put the gadget down. Turn around. Let me see that gun. Put it down before I blow your head off, motherfucker. Shit, blow away, asshole. It don't mean nothing. Shoot him, Stan. Shoot him. Oh, shit. Get off me, coz. Damn, man. - Get off me, man. - Don't cuff him, Stan. Get him up. Get up! This is my park. I'm gonna give you a 9mm in a second. Wait a second. Whoa whoa, come on. I don't do that, man. All right. Let's shoot him, Stan. It's not right to shoot. He's not a threat. Well, he's willing to kill a cop. We take him out now... we're gonna save another life. Let's shoot him. Don't shoot. Look, man, look, I know some valuable things. - You don't know shit. - I know some real shit, man. The dude named Ray Delacroix, man, Delacroix. The dude hangs on El Dorado Street, man. That nigga's got the whole damn street, coz. - What? - Ray Delacroix, man. - What does he look like? - Man, the cat's black, man. He's a black dude with freckles, man. And he drives a tight green Capris. And the Capris got some 24s on it. What do I care about a mid-level dealer in a fat car? Big fucking deal. The nigga is a DEA agent, man. The dude works for the feds and he works for the street muscles. Now why do I care about a Fed rat named Delacroix? Get up. Shit, Latin Kings. - Are you okay? - I'm all right. - That was lucky. - Not for Downey Little. So after they found his partner dead, he asked for you to transfer over from patrol to the VCTF and become his partner? Yeah, a little kick in the paycheck. I needed it too. I have a wife and three kids at home. Tell me about your family. Why? You're not profiling my family. For your file, I need for you to talk about it. Not about my family. Let's talk about your partner. What about him? All I know is he's the first to go through the door every time, all right? He put a lot of drug dealers behind bars and he killed a few, okay? And that colors your opinion of him? Look, except for our task force, the department is a laughingstock, all right? It's gonna get worse before it gets better. We got gangs from all around the country circling this city like a pack of fucking rabid dogs. Guys like Andy and me, we're all that stands between people like you and the end of the motherfucking world. I'm so fucking bored, man. We gotta find some trouble. Are you ready for some trouble, huh, son? Huh-uh, no. You gotta learn how to welcome that shit, man. You gotta learn to love that shit. You can start noticing this shit, Barney. What's the matter? Quit playing with your dick. Hold up. Here we go. What the fuck is that? - It's fucking Santa Claus up ahead. - Do you see what I see? I see a ghost. The motherfucker can't be riding up here unless I say so. You see he's got his lights off? He's trying to creep. Oh, you wanna play? All right. I see he's slowing down. Oh, you give me a reason. Are you gonna give me a reason? - Wanna play? - He wants to fucking play. Let's play. - Are you fucking ready? - Let's do this. Where is he going? Keep an eye on him. Keep an eye on him, Barney. Here we go. Look alive. What was his fucking set, Barney? Right or left? - Left. - Left? - Where'd he go, Barney? - Take a right about right here. Come on, Barney, where the fuck is he? - Maybe we should just take off, man. - Fuck that shit, man. Just fucking deal with it another night. That motherfucker can't roll up in Mid-City like that. Hey, there he is. Did you shit your pants? You fucking creep piece of shit. What you got there, boy? That sure don't look like fried chicken and watermelon, boy. You tagging me, motherfucker? Recognize, bitch. You know who you're talking to? - Recognize. - I don't give a shit who you are. Roll up your window. Get the fuck out of here. Shut the fuck up, you freckled-face fuck. - Where are you, Niggermint Pattie? - What, did you steal Santa's sleigh? I'll bust a cap in your ass right now. Hey, hands on the wheel. Oh. Metro Narcotics. You breathe, you die, motherfucker. Cover him, Barney, cover him. That's it. - Shit. Shit. - Get right up there. I thought we were just playing. Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here. Fucking move. I'm DEA, motherfucker. Shit, DEA, are you? - Fucking dirty. - He's DEA. You fucking dirty cop. Dirty, huh? Just enough to still be alive. You went and got filthy. Look where it got you. You're dead, motherfucker. Throw of the dice, DEA. - What about our fucking backup? - You're my backup, Barney baby. Barney, what did you do? You shot that motherfucker in the head, Barney. He's DEA? DEA... that's a bullshit fucking story, ain't it? - That was good shooting, Barney. - What about our backup? That's all right. Look, we're gonna wash it down with a little half and half... half his money, half his dough. - Half and half. - Half his money, half his dough. Barney, you see, in this world you ain't special... you ain't special unless you got fuck-you money. - I shot him in the head. - That was a good shot. - I shot him in the head. - That's right. You shot that motherfucker in the head. We're fucked. We're fucking fucked, you know that? Barney, call it in, huh? I want you to call it in. I'm gonna check the car. - You want me to call it in? - Call it in, buddy. - You sure you want me to call it in? - Call it in, Barney. Whoo! - Somebody might see us. - I told you you're a fucking ghost. You don't exist in Mid-City unless I fucking say so. Huh? Are you listening to me, you motherfuckers out there? Ah-oo! Oh, shit, Barney. Damn, I told you it was a good night. Call the shit in, Barney. You're gonna get my ass killed. You're one crazy motherfucker. Barney, can't you feel it? Oh, Barney, this is the best part. I can feel his soul cutting right through me. How are the storm repairs coming? The roof's still got a hole in it, but it's coming along. Well, I got some money saved up. If you want, I could loan you some. We're doing okay. I really appreciate it, though. Yo, Andy, - about tonight, you know... - Hey, shut up. You did good. Daddy. Stop chasing your sister through the house. If she hurts herself, I'm gonna knock you out. Dinner's almost ready. Please do something with him. Come on. I got it. Can the roof man come out tomorrow? Hello. Yeah. That's good news. We're covered for rain damage, just not flood damage. Who is it? Hold on. Hold on. Yeah, okay okay. It's the insurance broker. He says we're covered for rain damage... rain damage. Get off me, bitch. Whoa! You don't talk like that. What is wrong with you? - Apologize to her. - I'm sorry. I'd better never hear that mess come out of your mouth again. FBI. Where are the shooters? Right there, sir. - Vasquez? Balentine? - Yes, sir. Yeah. Who's you? Agent Brown, FBI. You boys know what you've done? Yeah, my fucking job is what I've been doing. - Yeah, our job. - That's what I did. Your job, huh? I killed this drug-dealing piece of shit named Ray Delacroix. - You killed a federal agent. - Oh, he's one of yours? Is that right? Why didn't you teach him not to shoot at police officers, Special Agent? Did you identify yourselves as police? Shit, yeah. He opened up on us first, just like that. Captain Friendly. - Vasquez, what we got here? - Yeah, Captain, he rolled up on us, right? He rolled up on us hard. We identified ourselves as police and he just opened fire. That's right. - Why would he do that? - Check your toxicology reports. That motherfucker was so high, he was coming in for landing. All right, get on back, fill out the report. He deserves a fucking medal, Captain. He was still alive. His heart was pumping blood for a few minutes before he was shot in the brain, stopping his heart. Right. The first shot to the torso. Suspect raises gun. They fire again, and in self-defense the backup officer shot him in the head. That's good shooting. You know what I think? I think your detectives coup-de-grace'd him with the third shot, executed him. So you say he's one of yours. What was he working on? It's a federal investigation. Y'all need to be cleaning up your own house. You're here to investigate your vic? Man, my guys are clean. Captain, your department is fucking legendary... suspects beaten, short counts on drug deals, cocaine that never makes it to the evidence locker. Have you got any evidence to back that up? More than you know. So this was your first shooting incident? Yes, ma'am. How did you feel? I felt pretty good, 'cause, see, I realized right there that if I needed to fire my gun to protect and serve, you know, I could. How do you feel about taking another human being's life? I did my job. It was a righteous kill. It was all good. They are fucking animals out there, all right? I go after the animals. It's what I do. I had a snitch the night before last finger Ray Delacroix. - I wanted to talk to him. - It's too late for that, unless you want to call Psychic Friends Hotline. You did a good job on it. Did he say anything I might want to know? He called me a punk motherfucker. I knew that. Is that why you shot him? Shit, we're from Mid-City, yo. - We eat our dead. - Yeah, we eat our dead. In other words, fuck, it was getting late and I was hungry. Shit, I like me a little dog meat from time to time. - You know what I'm saying? - Preach it, brother, preach it. Yeah, it looked like a good meal, so yeah, I did... I shot him. Cocksuck, motherfuck. Give me some chew. I'm a Mid-City cop. Who the fuck are you? So it really is true... those rumors. Y'all really do eat your dead. They eat their dead? Well, I hold my socks up with thumb-tacks. I wipe my ass with razor wire. I'm not asking, I'm telling... you're gonna help me find out what I would have, had you not smoked him. You didn't hear? Lincoln freed the slaves. I don't do your heavy lifting. - Yeah, you do. - Yeah? Since when? Since you put Ray Delacroix in hell. - Come on in. The water's fine. - The water is fine. But bring your fucking water wings, huh? Bring your water wings. Uh-huh. - Bring your fucking water wings. - Let's play. Hey, Stan, I'll treat you to a lap dance later, get you away from that wife, loosen you up a little bit. - I think we should rush him. - Fuck him up. This is bullshit. I didn't do anything. Come on, man, just let me go. Hey, any harder and I would have to charge you. Ferraro, in my office, now. - Yes, sir. - I got the feds so tight on my ass, I feel like I'm wearing J Edgar Hoover's G-string. Are these guys mentally sound? There are some red flags, some warning signals. The normal feelings of guilt and remorse after shooting are sublimated by the feeling that it's us against them. This mindset can lead to feelings of paranoia and isolation. Oh, man, all the neighborhoods in this area... they're run by... controlled by violent gangs. And there's large sums of dope money at stake. And as a result the police have been given extra latitude to enforce the law. - Given or taken? - What the hell? That's the way it is. You didn't answer my question. I'm not finished with my analysis, sir. I think one of the cops on my street unit cut himself a deal with the FBI. Blowing the whistle on other cops? Did they tell you this? I think they wanted me to know to see what I would do. Regardless, if there's a rat in the squad... You expect me to find this out? That's a job for Internal Affairs. But you're supposed to have their backs. I am supposed to evaluate their mental state. They are protected by my oath of confidentiality. Which you can break to report misconduct. If you happen to hear anything... Oh, if I happen to find a rat? No, you need to talk to me, Ferraro. You work for me. Uh-huh. So much for the 3NGs. Yeah. Chamorro and the Latin Kings did a heck of a job. That used to be the 3NGs. You think they pissed off the do-rags, the Latin Kings? Used to be five guys standing on a corner make up a gang. This is different. You can't buy that in a local gun shop. It's not even legally imported. Someone spent a lot of money trying to lock up drug traffic in New Orleans. More likely this is a local turf war between 3NGs and Latin Kings. If that's true, how come the FBI is on it? FBl... they're always playing their own game. They're probably investigating the same shit we are. Damn, look at this. Relax. You all know why we're here. Someone's gotten greedy. Are you trying to start a turf war? New Orleans is ready, open for the taking. We have to establish who's in charge. You mean, like a vote? I guess the ayes have it. Fuck you. Check this out. I've been working on this. All right, let's hear it. I'm from Mid-City. We eat our dead. Preach it. Preach it, come on. Delacroix, that motherfucker, forgot he was a puppet. Now he rocks the flowerbed. I feel like I'm riding with fucking Edgar Allan Poe. - You see what I see? - We got something. - Oh, shit. Go go. - Good morning. Barney, go get her. Go get her. Get on the ground. Get on the fucking ground. I'm not above that. Hold on a second. All right, you're gonna like this. Abracadabra! Everybody get back inside. Are you still living on the corner over here? Which one? You're not gonna fucking move. You're not gonna fucking say a word. Don't fucking move. It's too tight. Shit, it's too tight. Let me get my... - What's your name? - Tanya. Tanya. Tanya, okay. I see you. - Jimmy. Jimmy Dean. - Hey, what up, dawg? You all right? Where are we going, Barney? - I told you straight ahead. - Straight ahead, boss. Straight ahead, all right. Who's the lit bitch? Just little chickenheads in here. Hey, how are you doing? Whoa whoa. What's the bitch's name? - What's her fucking name? - Selina. Selina, open the door. Metro Narcotics. - Open the fuck up, Selina. - You need a search warrant. We don't need a search warrant. Tanya here gave me permission - to get her shit. - Open up. Selina baby, you're not in trouble, but you make me huff and puff and blow your door down... I'm gonna find your shit. I'll find it and then I'm gonna set some cops on you. I'm getting pissed. Open the motherfucking door. - Open the fucking door. - Okay okay. - Hand up. Here we go. Hands up. - Hands up. Hands up. Get your fucking hands up. Bitch, you want to get punched in the mouth, huh? Turn the fuck around. Get your nose in the fucking corner. - Dump the fucking bag. Okay. - What have we got here? You were going somewhere hot with this. - I was going nowhere. - Good shit. Why don't you make love to this thing here? I don't want to see your face. What have we got here? Don't you know that this...? This roca right here is peligrosa, Barney. - What do we got? - Oh, we're racking it up now. There we go. There we go. Now I see why you were in such a hurry. - You're on parole, huh? - Yeah. - Spread 'em. Here we go. - Oh, man. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. You're gonna spend the rest of your sentence in the slammer, baby, maximum security, whatever they tack on for the possession of crack cocaine. That's a felony, baby doll. So what do you want? You girls used to party with Ray Delacroix? We did. Delacroix? Who do you think fucking killed him, bitch? Shit. He was DEA. Don't tell me you didn't know that. - I didn't. - You didn't know that? Fuck you. Fuck you. You're going in. - Fuck you both. Fuck you both. - Take 'em in. - Let's go. - Wait. No no no. Oh, now you want to talk? Sit down. Fucking sit down. Fucking sit down, bitch. What do you got? Come on, talk to me, bitch. - What do you got? Spit it out, do it. - Look, listen, Ray was hanging out at this place, this FEMA trailer park all the time. - FEMA? - Yeah. That's fucking federal. Are you bullshitting me? You'd better not be fucking bullshitting me. - Did you know that? - I didn't. You believe me, don't you? - We don't want no trouble. - You don't want no trouble? - Be nice. - Be nice, huh? Oh, whoa. Don't kiss me on the lips, you crackhead bitch. Barney, I'm commencing a proper search. - How long are you gonna be, Pepe? - I'm gonna be a second. Why don't you make yourself a drink? My partner gets a little rough and stuff. It doesn't matter. I like rough. - You like rough? - Yes. Oh, shit. Not on the fucking mouth. Oh, yeah, baby. Whoa. Oh, God. Please, we don't want any trouble. Why don't you take the cuffs off? Why don't you polish the badge, baby? You wanna do something? Give it a little... there you go. That's it. - Oh, shit. - Uncuff me. All right. That's a fine moment for Metro Narcotics right here. I looked at his file. Kenny's ancient history, believe me. Your father's. That's what this is about. That's why you brought me here, huh? I'm trying to figure out why you push yourself to the edge. Well, I'm a clean cop. That's all that should concern you. Maybe I'm concerned about your safety. Oh, you're concerned about me? That's nice. Look, there's crime We're a proactive department. We go out and find it. And then what? Don't hesitate. Enforce the law. You can't think in a shootout. It's just your motor reflexes. I know a bad guys is gonna shoot Stan... I'm gonna shoot him in the head. If somebody has a gun pointed at me, he's gonna shoot them. Total trust in your partner. Yeah. Does your partner feel the same way? He knows he's safer with me than with anyone else on the force. Really? You're out there, gun strong, black knife, up against a closed door. If you want your partner to be safe, wait for backup. Don't go chasing a legacy. You got me all figured out, huh? If I had you all figured out, I'd have ordered. Nothing's going on. It's fucking late. My daddy's partner used to hate working nights. He used to let him go home. He didn't mind it so much. Why not? He had his own way of looking at things. He said the city would wake up when people went to sleep. He said the city was his then... his to protect, that he would save it from the evil and the shadows one by one. What happened that night? Did they ever catch the guy? There's another floater over there. When is this night gonna end? Looks like someone took out the trash. Russians, Asians, brothers sharing the same grave. Definitely a turf war. Not much of a war. Chamorro has taken everybody out. How many more do you think they'll find? What the hell is wrong with this picture? Nothing. He ain't lost. N7B 9F7. The car's registered to a Jason Trotter. Jambalaya Jake. He's a big-time pimp for all the gangs. He used to work for Kenny and me. He's heading into the 6th, not too late to make the 11:00 News. He just eye-fucked us. That's Chamorro's crib. Let's head around back. What's up, man? You all right? Who's the bitch, bro? Fine motherfucker there, man. Oh, shit, baby, that's what I'm talking about. Come on with it. Suck Jake's dick, bitch. What are you doing? Well, I had a nice Sunday drive. Now I'm going to take a stroll. Andy, no warrant, no probable cause, no nothing? Come on, you know what's going on in there. How much PC you want? I'll radio for backup. No, then they got a record you got no probable cause. Look, I don't want to get shot, all right? Stan, chill. The bad guys don't aim. That's why they shoot the wrong people. They don't need to aim with the kind of firepower they got in there. Look, this is fear itself. When they see the flames at the end of my shotgun, the devil himself won't be able to shoot straight. I promise you, the first badass that shoots at us and I blow him to hell... fear will set in. I will not let them shoot you. - You know why? - Why? You got charisma. What would your wife say? She's probably say for me to stand up for myself and my family and that she needs me for everything in her life. What would separate you from them? My death. What else? Look, what's supposed to happen here? Just talking. This is not talking. You're searching for something. I don't know what you're looking for, but you're not gonna find it. What are you afraid I'm gonna ask you? Get your ass up, bitch, and get on that fucking bed. Shit. - What's up, Jake? - What's up, baby? You all right? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I got a little something for you in there. Go handle your business, man. But don't kiss it. - What's up, Jake? - What's up, Andy? Shut up. Andy, what the fuck is going on, bro? - Shh. - What the fuck is going on, man? - Yo, who is this nigga, man? - Quiet, shh. Hey, Andy, I'm really sorry for what happened to Kenny. - I always liked him. - Shut up. Andy, talk to me, man. We're boys, man. Huh? You gotta believe me, Andy. I ain't had shit to do with this, bro. Hey, you ain't gotta talk to me like this, man. - Get down. Get down. - Freeze! Nobody move. Metro PD. Now slowly put your hands on your head. All right, fuck, I'll give you 10 to put your hands on your head. One... Andy, what the fuck, man? Don't do this shit. Don't do this shit. ...two, three, four... Get your fucking hands up. He's serious. I know this nigga, man. ...five, six... - Put your hands over your head. ...seven... - You ain't got to do this shit. ...eight... - God damn it, hands up. ...nine... - Come on, Andy man. ...nine and a half... I said to wait till 10. Oh, shit! Oh, God damn. You just rest easy, Jake. Oh, God damn. Get the motherfucking hospital. Stan. Nice. Hold up. Our PC was gunshots. Our reasonable suspicion was the area. The door opened. They fired. We defended ourselves. - I got it. - Let me hear you say it. Be specific. We were driving by. We heard shots... five or six. - I said I got it. - We entered into a gun battle without calling for backup in order to save a life. We neglected our own safety to protect and serve others. Boom. I hate it when you treat me like I'm a fucking kid. - No. No, please. - Shh. - You've seen nothing. - No. - You know nothing. - No, okay. All right, get along. Gun! Shit. What do we got? What do we got? Aw, Barney what did you...? Oh, shit. Shit. Good shooting, partner. This hype is unarmed. Aw, fuck. What did you do, Barney? Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. He pointed a gun at us, end of story. Good shooting, Tex. Nice. We'll keep that... just a little bite. The asshole pointed a gun at you. You shot him dead. - Barney. - Yeah. - Barney. - Yeah, I'm with you. I'm with you. Come on. Hey. Hey, bro. Here are the cavalry. Hey, they shot you, Jambalaya Jake. - Don't you want to know who? - Fuck you. You murdering motherfucker. You know, they say that when you're dying you lose your mind in stages. But you're not there yet. You want to tell me something? They say that shit when you die of old age, not from being shot, you stupid-ass motherfucker. That's true. Andy man, I got you a lead on Delacroix. Seems like he was spending most of his time at this FEMA trailer park... - Lakeview. - Lakeview, yeah. See you motherfuckers in hell. OIS and IA have cleared me. Mm-hmm. But there were four lethal shootings in three years. Yes, ma'am, I'm a good shot. You confront violence with violence. Yes, ma'am. Mm-hmm. And if another man came through that door right now pointing a gun at my head, what would you do? I'd shoot him. And you'd thank me. You wasted your time driving down here, partner. I couldn't get you the search warrant for the trailer park. Well, then get another judge. Not proper procedure, Andy. Get you a wire, get some tapes and pictures, and we'll get you your warrant. The way things are now, no judge is gonna touch this. - Don't bullshit us, all right? - Where you at, Shaft? The drug house shootout is still under investigation. - You're lucky you still got that badge. - So are you. - They're not gonna let it happen. - They? Who's they? Who? My hands are tied. You can't have a warrant for that establishment without pictures and a wire. Now who the fuck cares really? I do. Where do they find these guys? Fucking lawyers. Fucking cops. Good? Mm-hmm. I understand. - What happened? - It's official. The feds are investigating the guys on my unit. FBI got a tip about a denied warrant request. They suspect officers are gonna make the raid anyway without the warrant. They're gonna be there waiting on my guys. FBI calls me and says, "Your men are dirty. Yeah, and if you warn them, we're gonna know that you're as dirty as they are. Are they guilty? They're guilty of being underpaid. They're guilty of being police in this division. What do you mean? I mean the public is tired. They're tired of all this violence. They're tired of the city they don't recognize no more. Is your duty to the law less important than your loyalty to those men? Now, Ferraro, you know these men. They beat and force confessions. They maybe steal, maybe worse. But they're doing it for our side. Then warn them. I can't. Then why are you telling this to me? I mean, we are trying to prevent a gang war. The city's rebuilding and the drug dealers aren't gonna wait for federal funding. They're industrious. That gives you permission to do anything you want? No, but ultimately out on the street no one's gonna control what I do... no judge, no jury. Out on the street I have the authority, and they know it. I am the law. Oh, and if that law is corrupt... You think I'm corrupt? - It don't matter what I think. - Bullshit. Our little time together... you're getting attached. I get paid not to. Seriously, though, you don't see it? See what? A lot of problems out there, trying to make things better, get up every morning, come to work, counsel those who've drifted among the ashes, work hard, stay focused, so you can do your job. You think I'm just like you, don't you? Which is why you want me to change, be less hard-boiled. Maybe then there's hope... hope for this department, hope for our city, hope for you. What are you afraid of most? Some other time. Ma'am. Andy, let's do it by the book. Thanks for the advice. It's not advice. - Hey. - Hey. Hi, Andy. How's it hanging? How's it hanging? What did you say? Sorry, sir. - Hi, Andy. - Hi. These kids... I told them to turn the TV off. Nice TV. Yeah, I just got the last of the insurance settlement money, got a little left over. Bye-bye. Love you. Bye-bye. Baby, have a good day. I love you. Oh oh oh, I call the Caddy. - No no, we're in the Caddy. - We got the Caddy. I don't want this Buick, man. This Buick has got fumes. I got the tip. I get the Caddy. You know how Mexicans are and their Caddies. - Are you coming, Stan? - You want me to ride in this shit? You heard what he just said. It's got motherfucking fumes and shit. Why you got us in this shit car? God damn. Who wants to ride around in this motherfucker? - Are they set? - They're set. They're watching them. Come on in, boys. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I came up short last time. Fuck, it's Tanya. Oh, Selina. - Who? - It's our tip-off, man. Who the fuck cares? Let's do this. - Play it by the book. - Thanks for the advice. It's not advice. - Come on. - Hold on. This is a setup. - What? - It's no good. We're being set up. - What do you mean, a setup? - What are you talking about? The warrants. It's no good. Who said it's a fucking setup? It's never stopped us before. What? Oh, no no no. - B team, what's going on? - Do you guys have anything? Somebody tipped him off. Somebody got to him. God damn it! How did you know for sure we were being set up? Because we were, Stan. I could feel it. Something's not right. We got ratted out. - Who do you think it was, AJ? - Why would he care? I don't know. Captain Friendly or Pepe or Barney? Barney's a bitch. Friendly... no. Maybe Pepe is a snitch. You tipped them off, didn't you? What are you talking about? Somebody warned them at the trailer park. - I didn't warn them. - You're lying. Fuck you, Brown. You don't scare me no more. I'm no longer cooperating with your investigation. In fact, I just may open up an investigation on you. Wait a minute. We had an agreement to make this city safe. We're on the same side. Well, that's my goal, but I have no fucking idea what your goal is. Yeah, well, I'm sorry you feel that way. Look around, Friendly. Nobody is safe in this city. I mean, nobody. Go fuck yourself, Brown. FBI. You four are coming with us. What, did they win some prize? What? Let me call you back. We came down here to correct the problem with corruption in this division's Street Narcotics Enforcement Unit. Now we have enough evidence to charge you with murder. However, before we take this case any further, we'd like to offer you deals in exchange for your testimony against other dirty cops. Really? Well, I have not seen or know of any police misconduct. There's no dirty cops in that unit. There's no fucking way. - We're all clean. - You guys are all the same. Just take this deal 'cause you're dirty. We got a cop in your unit in our pocket. You got a cop you turned. Yeah, this idiot was selling dope to an undercover FBI agent. He's admitted to stealing and selling cocaine as well as framing suspects. So he framed guilty suspects, sir? What else is new? He's framing cops? If you put him on the stand, everyone will know what he did, so that's not much of a witness. Now let me drop a bomb on you... we have a witness who saw you kill everybody in the LKs' crib. She saw you and your partner enter and commence a gun battle. Bullshit. She witnessed you and Balentine shoot an unarmed man. She then observed you plant a gun on the dead man and take his money. Is that it? If that's it, then I'm getting the fuck out of here. You're fucking crazy. You're talking about that crack whore? So you admit she's a witness. If she is the same little strawberry crackhead I let go, she was there, but she wasn't a witness. She didn't see anything. See, when guns go off, people duck. So she didn't see a thing. And there ain't no jury or judge who's gonna believe a poor little crack whore over a couple of hero cops. It's automatic to call for backup, but you didn't call for backup because you didn't want patrol to discover your criminal conduct. No probable cause. Looks to us like you went in there to rob, to kill. Gunshots are probable cause. And we didn't have time to call that in. The cop we turned is telling the truth. We believe him, and so will the jury. And by the way, we're gathering collaborative evidence, and it's about as easy to find as getting wet in the rain. Scores of your arrests were bogus. Your unit planted evidence, framed and even shot innocent victims to serve time for crimes they didn't commit. With respect, that's all lies. Now I'm not a lawyer, but I do have a rough idea how this kind of thing works. And I'm telling you, doing you a favor here, that your strategy will not fly. You gotta take criminals out of jail to testify against us. You will have conceded that these criminals were wrongly convicted. Once you get these criminals out of prison, the first thing they're gonna do is hire other criminals called lawyers and they're gonna sue the city for millions... all this based on allegations of one lying con man cop. Your only shot of convicting us of anything is by turning a second cop, and that's not likely. Only dirty cops will, and they usually don't live long enough to testify. The rule of thumb in the drug world where there's this much money is that there's always law-enforcement corruption... dirty cops, dirty DEA, dirty CIA, dirty FBI. But you won't make the cops the scapegoats. There's one more thing... you just committed a crime by revealing the identity of a federal witness. You did just do that. Yes, but I didn't tell you anything. Sure you did. You said that there was a dirty cop. How long do you think it's gonna be before we find out who that is? In your police report you said that Jambalaya Jake died telling you important information. That's right, sir, but I'm not gonna tell you. Believe me, though, he did tell me what I wanted to know. Yeah? And what's your MO for making suspects talk? I can't really describe it, but I'd like to show it to you. Yeah, I bet you would. And you'll tell me what I want to know. I won't tell you anything under any circumstances. You don't know who you're dealing with. Captain, Doctor, you're my independent witnesses. I'm putting these clowns on notice. They committed a crime by revealing a partial identity of a federal witness. Andy, if you and your men crossed the line, - I cannot protect you. - All right, all right. - Hey. - Sorry about that. Listen to me. The feds are serious. Oh, are you afraid I'll go to jail? No, I'm afraid you won't make it to jail. I thought they paid you not to get attached. I know I'm not a rat. I know Stan is not a rat. - I ain't no rat. - I ain't no fucking rat. We're gonna find out who it is and then we're gonna set him up. Put a bullet in his head. I'll put a bullet in your head. That's not how we do things. - What about the witness, Andy? - I let her go. She didn't know nothing. - Let her go? Jesus fucking Christ. - She didn't know nothing. She was a brutalized strawberry little crackhead. Besides, you stole and you didn't give me my share. Hey, we'll cut you in there. We'll give you your share. - Moron. - What? You just let him trick you into telling him anything. - Hey, shut the fuck up, Stan. - What else did you tell? - Wanna start some shit? - Listen, hey, I didn't know there was a crime 'cause I didn't know you guys stole. I didn't know she was a wit 'cause I didn't know you guys committed a crime. And I don't want a share 'cause I don't steal. Let me see if I get your version of the Commandments here, Charlie. So you're saying that stealing is bad, but what you do, which is lying and beating people and killing them and letting witnesses go 'cause you want to fuck 'em... that's good? You're like the idiot version... Hang on. She was a brutalized little strawberry. - Of the Bible, you dumb fuck Moses. - Number one... I never struck anybody that didn't assault me first. Number two... I never killed anybody who didn't shoot at me first, more or less. And that's a brutalized poor little crackhead. That's a sick thing to say. Besides, it's your fucking girl brought us here. Don't worry. That bush is done burning. Let me straighten them out. If you talk to me like that again you're gonna meet with a horrible disfiguring accident. You understand what I'm saying? Yes, bring it. Dumb fuck Moses. - Andy. - Barney. - Hey, he just fucking set me up. - What the fuck is wrong with you? What was I supposed to do? What did your parents do to you, huh? You've had too many long rides on your Uncle Bubba's knees? - Fucking asshole. - Why are you always running your mouth? Barney, you're this close. You're this fucking close. - Why are you always running your mouth? - Let's just do it. Come on. Hey, Tanya, it's me. It's Barney. Shh shh. - You hear something? - I don't like it. I don't like it. Yo, guns up. Hit it. All right, go. Oh, shit. - Oh, God. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck that. Yeah, they took it up a notch. Oh, God. Let's back the fuck off this. Let's go. - Oh, shit. - They fucking cut out their tongues. I can't believe they cut out your tongue, baby. She won't be licking my badge no more. It's okay, baby. It's okay. Barney's here. It's gonna be okay. Barney, let's go. I'll miss you. Their case ain't ready but they showed us their hand. Why? To scare us. This park is ground zero for drug trafficking in the city. And we cleaned it up, didn't we, Stan? Ain't that right? Man, forget this park. I can't. They found my daddy not far from here. They never found the guy. I can't tell you what his face looks like, what color his skin is, but I've seen his face 1000 times, every collar I made. I've been chasing him for years, Stan. I ain't gonna chase him no more. Man Andy, we're inches away from losing everything. We can't fight the feds. Maybe we should just step off and let them finish their plan. They just want to take our guns away so we lose control of this park. We lose control of the park... we lose the city. This is my city, Stan. Andy, you're too close, man. Back off. Hey, what's up, man? I got the elevator. I got it right here, man. Metro PD, asshole. Put your hands on your head. Turn around. I like the way you cooperate. You're gonna tell me exactly what I want to know or I'm gonna take my piece and break one of your kneecaps. - You understand? - Yeah, man. I understand. What are you doing in my park? You know this is my park. Hey, man, look, word was the park was open for business, man. That's the wrong word. You'll get your ass shot off down here, - you know that? - I got a franchise. From who? You know, this motherfucking Spanish dude from Florida. - Latin Kings? - Look, man, you can't do shit out here no more unless the LKs give you the green light. Give me a name. - Give me a name. - Chamorro, man. - Where is he at? - The FEMA trailer park, man. That's where I get my shit sometimes. - If I search you, what am I gonna find? - Man, come on. What is he gonna find? $200 on the street against five-to-10 in the joint. Ain't worth it, brother. Get your ass out of my park. Run. Where do you think he's got the 20 dime rocks at, in his ass? Thompson sub-machine gun... Tommy gun. not bad for 1921. Yeah. Davey Johnston... the hardest-working, toughest litigator - this city's had in generations. - Thanks, Andy. Let me ask you a question. Every time we put up a case against the bad guys, it's always the same fucking story 'cause it works. And you guys always go along with us no matter what. Good. Now when was the last time a judge or one of you guys - found a cop's testimony not credible? - Easy now. Just listen. The judiciary and the district attorney's office have been our silent partners... or rather I should say we've been your silent partners making cases easy for you... no problem. Now the FBI comes sniffing around... nothing we can do about it. But if you let them make us the scapegoats, I'm gonna take everybody with me. The media are gonna have a field day. - Oh, yeah? - They're gonna eat you raw. Every time I stood in front of a judge, he acted like a de facto prosecutor. You know why? You know how many citations I got? You know how many years of incarceration my testimony generated? - Now I want my fucking warrants. - Andy, calm down. I'm not calming down. I'm throwing down. I'm gonna take you with me. I want my warrants. I'm sorry, Andy, but with the feds investigating you, no judge is gonna sign off on your warrants. Just try. We're this close. - Fucking lawyers. - Fucking cops. This place is a bit of a dump. Cops raided my crib, cabron. Any idea how many men I lost? You want a tissue? How about a fucking warning?! What, are you a child? You think this is a game? You wanted this city clean without getting your hands dirty. - Yeah. - You look the other way; I take out the gangs, kick back some paper; Everybody wins, right? Yeah, who wins by dumping bodies in the swamp, huh? Sloppy work. Have some beads. Just don't show me your tits. You fuck up one more time and I'll kill you. You understand me? Yeah? All right. Now I got one more thing I want you to do for me. Everybody has a melting point, right? Right. And you don't know what it is till you get there and do something. You melt down and it's too late. You do something you can't take back. Are you at your melting point? A partnership is like marriage... a contract of honesty between two men. What happened between you and Andy? I don't know. It just feels like I'm committing suicide, changing my mind at the last minute. At that very second you suddenly have a passion for life that you never knew. I understand. I agree with you. What brought this on, Stan? The FBl... they're following us around. They want to take us down. Uh-huh. You don't have to be scared if you're clean. I don't know what clean is anymore. Andy always says to me, "It's hard to be in this shit all day and come home clean." But he does. All the other cops... I see some shit rub off on them. He comes home fucking clean. What about you? Lately l... I've done some thing I ain't proud of. Did you break the law? Bent it all to shit maybe. But the FBl... they're wrong. They're going after good cops. I don't like it. I don't know how to fight back. You just tell the truth. You can't go wrong if you tell the truth. I don't know what the truth is anymore. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department has confirmed the brutal slaying of Police Captain John Friendly, shot to death just outside his home in uptown New Orleans. Witnesses report that two masked gunmen opened fire on the captain as he arrived home at approximately Captain Friendly, responsible for restoring order to the gang-ridden streets of New Orleans in the wake of Katrina, leaves behind a 30-year record on the force. He also leaves behind a wife and three children. The FBI has joined in the search for the two men. Once again, Metropolitan Police Captain John Friendly assassinated this evening. Do you think it's him? I don't know. Pepe is as corrupt as they come, but I don't know if he's up for this. Whoever this snitch is, though, we've got bigger fish to fry. What's that? He's sold his soul to the FBI, but these feds are dirty. They killed Friendly. We're next. We're going in now. Mid-City representing. I don't sleep with no fishes. Mid-City shoutout... Konichiwa Bitches. Pepe, shut the fuck up. Barney's ready. So I guess calling for backup's out of the question. There's gonna be plenty of police here real soon. Yeah, when they show up to arrest us. Are we even cops anymore? We're past that, brother. One, two, three. Motherfucker. Metro PD! Ay! Mis huevos! Mi cola! Cojones, mi cola! Hijo de puta, no! Drop the weapon. Drop it. - Tell me who your connection is. - I ain't no fucking raton. You're gonna be. One, two, three. Wake up. Shit. Fuck. One, two... one, two, three. Wake up. One, two, three. Wake up. - Who's your connection? - I ain't no fucking raton, man. You'd better tell him what he wants to know before he fucking kills you. Tell me who's your connection! Man, I deal with the feds, man. I take out the other gangs. Fucking Brown tips us off on possible drug busts, man. He warns us about search warrants. If we get arrested, he'll fucking bail us out, man. He controls the airports. He controls the borders. Fucking dirty cops, man. You're all the same, man. Pepe! Oh, shit. Fuck. Pepe, Pepe. I didn't know it was you, man. I couldn't see. I didn't know. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Freeze! Fuck. - You okay? - Yeah. Barney, you okay? - He's dead. - Who? Pepe. I killed him. I didn't mean to, Andy. I didn't mean to. Pepe is dead. Pepe is dead. Stan. DEA giving the Latin Kings the keys to the kingdom. Where are we going? Where we met. Where it all started. You have a new partner now. Do you trust him? Shoot him, Stan. Shoot him. Well, I've got some money saved up. If you want, I'll loan you some. We're doing okay. - Nice TV. - Yeah. We got a cop in your unit in our pocket. You're too close. Just back off. Back off. Is this where they moved in? Yeah, this is where they brought the dope. Looks like they're all cleared out. You want to look around? No, Stan. It's where we met. Something you want to tell me, Stan? No. Something you want to tell me? No. Andy man, I made a mistake. I needed the money. The baby was on the way. Then the hurricane. I didn't become a cop because of no crusade like you, Andy. I had to make a living. And I wasn't cutting it. You're my fucking partner, Stan. What, are you gonna shoot me? You're the rat, Stan. You work with Brown keeping the DEA away from me the whole time. You lied to me, Stan, ever since the flood, every day, every hour keeping me from my investigation. I took the money and Brown caught me. I'm not perfect like you. I ain't perfect, Stan. I'm your partner. You didn't have nothing to do with it. I didn't have nothing to do...? Andy man, it was before I even met you. Listen, you're my partner, so I'm gonna stand by you, but you're going in. What do you mean, going in? I'm gonna help you every way I can, but you gotta do some time, Stan. No, man, I'm not going nowhere. Come on now, you're not gonna shoot me. Stan, I'm your partner. - What was I supposed to do, Andy? - You lied to me. No, you tell me what I was supposed to do. I don't know, Stan. Hey. Lose the piece, drug dealer. I'm the FBI. I got nothing to do with drugs. Chamorro ratted you out. Now you're going down. Chamorro was a means to an end. We're on the same side. It's over, Brown. I still got this. Andy man, this is the asshole you've been chasing your whole life. - Let me fucking shoot him. - No good, Stan. We're gonna take him in. There's a deal for both of you. What for, man? We won't make it back to the station house. We gotta finish this here. Johnson, God damn it, help me out here. Case closed. Now let's get our story straight. - Let's get our story straight. - We got a code of silence, right? - That's right. - I'm your partner. I know you won't talk. We ain't got a lot of time. Let's get our story straight. We had no alternative but to defend ourselves with lethal force. Say it. We had no alternative but to use lethal force. Did you shoot him? Did he shoot himself? Was it an accident? Did he...? He was my partner. You okay, Andy?
