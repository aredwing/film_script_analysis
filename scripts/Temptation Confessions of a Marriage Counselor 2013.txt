Teacher. And how long have you guys been married? 10 years. Okay. At least we're in agreement about that. Do you have any children? No. No children. Do you want children? I do. Okay. Bradley? I just think we need to be in a better place before we bring somebody else into it. Okay. Do you wanna say something, Lisa? I love him. It's just that I think people change. Don't you agree? Yeah. They do. I often feel like we become a lot of different people before we actually settle into who we are. Especially when we're young. We were 18. I'm not the same little girl that was in love with him in high school. But I still love you. Tell me what you want me to do. I promise I can change. Tell me, please. Just don't do that. I can't do this. I'm sorry. Bradley, don't. I'm sorry. I don't wanna hurt him. He deserves better. Better than you? Yeah. Why do you feel that way? He's a good guy. He's consistent and loving. But I feel like we're roommates and not husband and wife. You met someone? And he's showing you everything you've been missing. This new guy, he excites you. He buys you flowers and he tells you that you're beautiful. He says all the things that Brad doesn't. It doesn't matter to me. I'm not here to judge you. I just think, if you're honest with me, then we can get to the root of the real issues. I'd like to tell you a story. About my sister. If that's okay. Judith. That was her name. I knew her so well. We were so close. We were raised in a very small town. And our mother, Sarah, she took us to church five days a week. And twice on Sundays. There wasn't a lotta time for fun. And boys? Forget about it. From the moment Judith and Brice met, something sparked between them. They became inseparable. They were the yin and yang to each other. Now, Sarah tried to keep a strict hand on Judith, but Judith was in love. And so was Brice. Yes, she's asleep. I promise. Let's go. Come on. Stop. You see, love, for Judith, seemed to be different from other people. For her, it was all-consuming. It was breath to life. Most times, they didn't even notice that Sarah was watching them. Gonna see you tomorrow. Somewhere along the way, she decided she couldn't fight this. Maybe this was meant to be. Or in her own words, "Maybe it was God's will." Judith was so worried when Brice asked for her hand in marriage. She just knew her mother would say, "No." But she reluctantly said... Yes. I'll tell ya, if smiles were dollars, they would have had millions. Bye! At last, they were together. And life began. They found this cute little place together. I won! No, I won! They didn't have much, but they had each other. So slow. Come on! What you waiting for? And they were more in love than ever. Brice's lifelong dream was to work in a small pharmacy that maybe one day he could own. And Judith, well, her dream was to become a marriage counselor. But that wasn't easy. So in the meantime, she found work with Janice Wise, the millionaire matchmaker. - Good morning. - Bonjour. Good morning. Your 8:00 a.m. is on his way up. - He's early. - Yeah. Okay. Merci. Here you go. Yeah. Look at those shoes. Yeah? I didn't notice. Thank you. I wasn't talking about hers, I was talking about yours. They look like orthopedic shoes. Judith, we've been going over this for weeks. Look around this office. What do you see? A bunch of women with hair from India? Look at me, Judith. What you should see is people in this office care about what they look like. Unlike you. We have over a billion dollars walking in and out of these offices looking for love. We have a standard to uphold. This is not our standard. Okay, Ava, I don't have to wear fancy dresses or fancy shoes to prove that I'm qualified to do my job. Yes, you do. - No, I don't. I have a degree. - Yeah, you do. - A degree? - Yes. A degree on the wall without labels on your back is nothing. Where are you from, new girl? Belvedere. Where the hell is that? In the South. The South. That explains it. You grew up below the Mason-Dixon. Okay, Ava, you really should take a Valium. You really need an iron to that skirt. What? I did. Say no more. That blouse. It's telling it all. So does your dress. What's wrong with my dress? Can you even breathe, Ava? You don't breathe in Herve. Follow me, Mr. Madison, Janice is waiting for you. Oh, my God. Who's that? You're killing me. You don't know who that is? No. The third largest social media inventor since Zuckerberg? Class-Meet? What planet are you from? What is he doing here? Please, don't tell me he's here to get fixed up by The Madam. She is no madam. You need to bite your tongue. She's a matchmaker and she's very good at her job. Yeah. So are pimps. Come. Please. Stay right there. I know she was talking to me. Whatever. Here we go. Yes? Ava, this handsome young man is looking to find a lot of answers as to how we do things around here. Take notes, please. Are you looking for a date? I'm sure this handsome face has no problem getting dates. Well, I'm actually in between relationships right now. So you could use our services? Well, I prefer the old-fashioned way of meeting women. You like to pay? No, that's not what I meant. What exactly do you do? Me? Yes. I'm the in-house therapist. This is Judith. Judith. Well, Judith, you are who I'd like to speak to. Judith, Harley is looking to invest in my company. We want to take Wise Counsel online and international. Okay. Well, before I make that type of investment, I like to be quite certain of what I'm getting myself into. I totally understand. And Judith will take great care of you. Ava, clear Judith's schedule. Judith, please, answer any questions Mr. Madison may have. Sure. Come right this way. All right. Bye. Nice to meet you. So you gonna start today? I think so. Thank you so much. Don't thank me yet. Did you show her what she's gonna do? Yes, ma'am. She'll be working the register and stocking the shelves. I check the register at random every day, so you're gonna have to account for every dime. - No problem. - Random! I got it. Brice tells me you're from Boston? Yeah. You don't sound like you come from Boston. Do you know Boston? No. I've never been there. Yet. What part of Boston? Roxbury. Are you married? No. I'm not married. Do you have kids? No. So should I get to work? Yeah, there's a box of deodorant under the counter that needs to be restocked. You can start there. Okay. Nice meeting you. Thank you. Hey- No husband? And that blouse she's wearing? And those boots? She's a lesbian. Does it matter? No. I don't think people will think there's anything between us, but you never know. People talk. Yeah. Matchmaking. I don't know how I feel about all this. I'm sorry? Well, it's a dating service for the rich. I just... I'm not sure this is something I should be investing in. You know, it's kinda strange. Yeah. So you agree with that? A little bit. Yeah. So I shouldn't invest? I'm not saying that. I would never say that. Like you said, it's a little strange. A little odd. Little unnatural. Bunch of old guys paying to meet women. I'm gonna shut up. I'm saying too much. No, no, honestly, continue, please. I kind of prefer the old-fashioned way of finding love, but... Well, I completely agree. I do. But, let me play devil's advocate. So, more than half of all new relationships are started online in this day and age. - Yeah. - Right. So it's obvious, she definitely... She has something going here. I'm just not sure exactly how I fit into it. That's why I'm here. To help you figure that out. I think we can start with the Wise Counsel questionnaire that I developed. And pretty much we use it to see whether or not someones compatible. Do I know you from somewhere? I doubt we run in the same circles. Do you run? Yeah, every day at... Landover Park. I knew it. You run there? 8:00 a.m. every Saturday. Start at the wheelhouse... I think I have seen you run past me before. You're that cheesy guy always running with his shirt off and making grunts. - I'm not cheesy. - Yeah, you are. I get hot. No, you're running with your shirt off so all the pretty girls could notice you. Well, you noticed me, right? Turn to page two. You'll see the compatibility questionnaire. All business. I wanted to start with that. I like that. Hey, you. How was your third week? Any better? Oh, God. That bad, huh'? Honey, what am I doing there? I have a master's degree. Why am I wasting my time in some snobby office helping old men get a date? Is that what I busted my butt in college and graduated early for? Like, it don't make sense. Babe, it'll get there. But, baby, I really feel like I'm getting stuck. You know what I had to do today? I just spent three hours with some cheesy computer guy named Harley something. The Class-Meet guy? Was he looking for a date? No. Does everyone know about this guy except for me? Baby, you should. He's loaded. Wow. You sound like Ava. Man. I have to get outta there and start my own practice. Babe, that's a long ways off. I figure in about 10 to 15 years we'll be established enough to take that chance. But right now you don't need to be thinking about that. 10 to 15 years? Great, that's encouraging. Thanks, baby. And my mother called me today. And she's coming into town for some revival or something. Which is just what I need. The stress of this job and the judgment of my mother. You know she's gonna be bothering me about you, asking me, "Judith Ann, have you been doing your wifely duties?" Yes, Mother, I have been cooking for him, I have been cleaning, and I have been having sex with him three times a week, just like it says in the Bible. It says three times a week, baby? Then you've been slacking. Shut up. I'm kidding. I'm not. And... You know that little thing you do on birthdays and holidays? I wonder what your mother would say about that. My mother doesn't know about that little trick I give you on birthdays and holidays. And if she did, you wouldn't get it anymore. I'm gonna get up. I'm gonna go make you some dinner. No. You know what I'm gonna do for you? I'm gonna take you out to dinner. That $1.99 buffet again, baby? Made my stomach hurt. No, I'm gonna take you somewhere nice and fancy. - Really? - Yeah, come on, let's go. Okay, I'm gonna go put my shoes back on. I'm gonna take you to the $5.99 buffet. All right, you! All right. - I did. - Good. And maybe next time we go, the lady next to us... I was watching and she had the artichoke dip. - I wanna order that next time. - I saw it. - It did look good. - With the chips. With the different color chips. That looked so good. - Now that. - With the enchiladas, too. That's a fine ass bitch right there. - Was he talking to me? - Babe, keep walking. I know you ain't talkin' to me. - Show some respect. Kick your ass to hell. - Baby, come on! - You know what? You need to be in church! - Damn it, get in the car, Judith! Pick up the Bible since you ain't got no good tact! - Judith, get in the car. - Your mama shoulda taught... Why would you let these assholes ruin our night? Ain't got no kind of manners. What the hell they talkin' to me like that for? This is crazy. Thinking I'm just some regular bitch on the street. Enough, Judith. - Think they can talk to me like that? - Enough! Let it go. I showed 'em! Just let it go. it doesn't matter. Their mama shoulda taught them better. She shoulda had them in school. - Judith. Judith! - Not hanging on the street. Common whore! - You stupid joker! - Judith! Baby, you been really quiet since dinner. Did I miss something? You didn't hear that guy? Babe, I knew that was it. Yes, I heard him. Some things you just gotta ignore. Why can't I ignore the fact that I didn't feel safe? Babe, those guys coulda had guns. We did the right thing. I just don't like the way I feel. Baby, I will always protect you. I'd die for you. I just wanna go to sleep. I'm sorry. I'm with you. If you say "go," I go. You! Stop it. - No, I'm being serious. - You are the worst. No, come on. Judith, Harley and I have been going over the questionnaire you came up with and he has some questions for you. You will be putting in some late hours trying to help him. You don't mind, do you, mon cheri? All right. I will be in my office, darling. Okay. Okay. Okay. So you have some questions? Yes. Yes. Now, this is actually really good. Thank you. I need to formulate a program that's gonna tell me what kinda person we're dealing with just based on your questions. That's a program I'd like to see. Well, good, because I need you to help me build it. I'm not a programmer. Well, that's fine. I just need your expertise on humans. All of these questions here. Now, they tell you a little something about the prospective client, right? Yes. As well as the people they will attract. Okay, great. What I don't understand is why are there so many questions here about past relationships. Because you learn a lot about someone from their prior relationships. You learn patterns. You learn behaviors. You learn whether or not they play the victim role. Do they take full responsibility for their role in the breakup? All that from one little sheet of paper? Yes. "Hmm" what? I've never wanted to know the past of any woman I was ever dating. Maybe that's why you're single. Okay. Last night, I went ahead and filled out one of these. Maybe you can tell me a little something about myself. Why would you fill this out? You're not trying to find a date. I'd like to see how good you are. Okay. Well, you are relationship-oriented. You give a lot in relationships. You believe in love, but because you've been hurt a few times, you've given up on it. You are passionate. You look like you got a little bit of a mean streak, though. Very attentive. Need a lot of reassurance. Very observant. Not bad. Not bad. So let's continue. Page two is really interesting. You need a ride? No, I'm good. Can you pass me my purse underneath there? Yeah. Thank you, guys. Good night. Good night. Something's wrong with the girl. What do you mean? Did you see the way she covered herself up as she's leaving? It's chilly. No, something's wrong with the girl. What, you don't think we made the right decision? I need the help. But she has to be watched. Why don't you just take the whole bucket? I don't want the whole bucket. Yes! Yes, yes, yes. Judith, you nailed another one. I did, didn't I? All right, come on, let's wrap this up. I gotta get home. Okay- 50-50 chance that couple's gonna work. -50-50? - Yeah. Training this computer to think like you. 50-50. 50-50. Let's go. Come on. 50-50. Can I get some? Wow. Okay. I'm impressed. I'm thoroughly impressed. My husband's never gonna believe that I'm helping out with stuff like this. You were amazing. How long you guys been married? Six years. I've known him for 19. 19 years? Wait, so you're a very old-looking young woman or you met him when you were five? Six. - Wow. - Yeah. So you're 25. 26. In three days. Happy early birthday. I never thought I would be one of those people that dread birthdays, but it just feels like it's a reminder that I'm not where I want to be. Where did you want to be? I thought by now, I'd at least have my license. I'd be a marriage counselor. I'd be on my way to starting my practice. You know... That's very noble, I think. Marriage counselor, that's a wonderful career. You should totally do that. You're super smart. Look at what we just did. Judith... I mean, you're bright. You're intelligent. You're motivated. Set up a business plan and make it happen. Now. Did I say something wrong? No, it's actually very encouraging. And you know I could totally help you with this marriage counselor thing. I mean, I have a successful business. You can ask me anything. What did you do different than the rest of us? Like, how'd you become so successful so young? I've always been ambitious. Very much a workaholic. So... What does that feel like? Lonely. It's kinda sad to be able to buy whatever you want and have to beg for what you need. My last relationship was back in college. I had met a wonderful woman. Completely blew my mind and I fell in love with her. And she walked out on me and I haven't really been able to rebound. Since then. Since college, huh? That's a long time. I didn't even know she was unhappy. Are you happy? Yeah. Yeah, very happy- He's a great guy. Good for you. Especially good for him. He's a very lucky man, Judith. It's getting late. Let's finish it tomorrow. There was something I wanted to bring up to you about the questionnaire. Yeah? I saw the questions about the relationships, compatibility, the hobbies, but there are no questions there about sex. No,no,no. I don't believe in sex before marriage, so why would we need that? Really? Yes. Wait a second. Where are you from? It's not about where I'm from. It's called I'm a Christian. I was raised that way. So what you're saying is your husband is the only guy you've ever been with. Ever. - Yes. - One guy. Yes, and my husband and I are very compatible. How would you know how sexually compatible you are when you have nothing to compare it to? I watch HBO. I know I'm not missing anything. I just keep picturing this same old, boring, turn the lamp off, fluff the pillows, always in the bedroom kinda thing. What's wrong with the bedroom? That's unfortunate. If you were with another man, you'd know that sex should be random. Like animals. When it happens, it just happens. In the kitchen. In the shower. In the office. On a plane. On the floor. Are you getting turned on? Please. You need to go home. Hey, babe. I made you a sandwich. What's wrong? Okay. Okay. - Now, baby, baby, attack me! - Attack you? - Yeah. Like an animal. - Like an animal? - Yeah, baby! - Okay. Just grab my hair! - Wait, grab your hair? - Yeah, and growl. Yes, baby. Come on, open this shirt! Okay, no. This is my new shirt. Come on, come on! - And scratch my back! - Baby, hey! Hey! Scratch? Look, this is weird. We're not gonna do this. I'm gonna forget you did this, okay? Now, if you wanna growl at something, you can growl at this sandwich. After we finish eating, we can go in the bedroom and do this the right way. Okay? Can I eat? Thank you. We could fluff the pillows, turn off the lamps. You know, do it the way we always do. It's going to be a great day if you're planning on being outdoors. So if you don't have to be at work, or even if you do, make sure you get outside and enjoy the warm weather. As we are experiencing some really nice above seasonal weather. You can expect sunny highs in the mid-70s and it could reach even as high as 78. Northwest winds are around five miles per hour, becoming westerly in the afternoon. Now, this high pressure is moving in from the southwest and it should be expected to stay with us for the next couple of days. Good morning. - Morning. - How are you? Good. You knocked me out last night. I know. I didn't do my job too well, if you're already up and running. Just going for a Saturday morning run. See you later. Imagine me running into you. What did you say? I'm sorry, I can't hear you. What? What? That's the trash-talking. That's what I hear. I'm pacing myself. Well, who's leaving who in the dust? Hey, watch out, watch out! I'm so sorry. You okay? - What is your problem, man? - I didn't see you. Say something! You gonna knock her down like that? You'll hurt him. Harley, wait, wait! No, Harley. No. - Harley, I'm okay. - Please! I'm really sorry. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. Just let him go. Just walk away. I'm okay. Okay? I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm okay. No, I'm okay. Let's get you up here. - Wait, wait, wait. - That's good. Let me go slow. Wait, wait. - Okay. All right, okay, this could be bad. - Wait, wait, wait. Let me call my husband. No, I live close by here. No,no,no. No, I'll wrap it up, I'll call my neighbor, he's a doctor. Okay, all right, but I still have to call, because... No, either way, we gotta get your leg... - No, no, no! Put me back down. - No, listen! Hey! I got you. Okay? All right. You good? Yeah. Wow, this, this place is just incredible. Thank you. So he's not answering. You know, it's actually feeling better. Well, it's not swelling. That's a good thing. I have to just walk it off. No, let me see. Just let me see it. Hold on. I don't know if I need all of that. Just hold on one quick second. Well, you're pretty good at it. Yeah, it's just a little something I picked up in college. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. So was my husband. Has a bunch of basketball injuries. Really? You talk about him a lot. It's kinda what you do when you're married. When he comes up, it's kinda in comparison to me. No, it's not. Yeah, it actually is. You wouldn't be comparing us, would you? Why would I do that? Well, you tell me. Okay, my husband is not up for discussion. - Well, you bring him up a lot. - No, I do not. Okay. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything about... Look, it's just that, on one hand, I really wonder who this guy is. And how special he must be to have gotten you. And on the other hand, I wonder, does he even know it. I wonder if he challenges you mentally. Does he bring out the best in you? Does he even notice you anymore? - You know what? I'm not... - Judith, listen. Just listen. If I had a woman as beautiful as you, I wouldn't miss a thing. Like the small blonde hairs on the back of your neck. Or how your left temple throbs when you're in deep thought. How calm you get when you're really excited. Like right now. That is very sexy. How slow you're breathing. Well, I don't miss anything either. Like the smell of jasmine perfume on this sofa that's obviously fresh. Or those pair of high heels in your bedroom. Those diamond earrings on this coffee table. Don't play with me, Harley. Verbal sparring. You know that's a sign I'm winning. Winning what? That must be Brice at the door. - Brice? Your husband? - Yeah. I can't wait to meet this guy. - Here, let me help. - I can walk by myself. I'm gonna help you, okay? Here we go. - See, I'm good. - All right. It's fine. Okay? Hey, be careful. - Hey! You must be Brice, right? - Yeah. Harley. Nice to meet you, man. Hey, babe, what happened? I fell down when I was running. Harley helped me out, though. - Thank you. - No problem. Thanks a lot, Harley, I'll see you later. Yeah. Nice to meet you. Likewise. Thanks again. It's, you know, it's just... - Good morning. - Morning. Babe, I was thinking. Were you and Harley running together? No, he just happened to be in the park. Okay. You look nice. Thank you. I'll be late tonight. It's that mid-month inventory. I hate the 15th. Yeah. Your breakfast is on the table. All right. Do I have any calls? Flowers! Susan, do I have any messages? I didn't know the 15th was your birthday. Happy birthday. Here you go. Hey, he remembered! I left the apartment this morning so mad. I thought my husband forgot my birthday. But he didn't! You are so excited about him. That is great. Did you try something new? With your hair? I sure did! I curled it. And you see that green comb? Right there in my hair? Unfortunately, I do. Is your fashion icon a Delta stewardess? That's what you look like. Oh, Ava. - Is this wool? - Yes. -It's making me itch. -It's a blend. A blend of what? Ava, can you just give me a break? It's my birthday. I tried to do something pretty with my hair. I have these beautiful flowers from my husband. I'm smiling. - Just give me a compliment or something. - That was a compliment. He's on his way up. Come on, we gotta go. - Who? My husband? - No, Harley. Come on, we really gotta fix this. - Is that spit? - Watch my manicure! - Why are you putting spit in my hair? - I'm trying to be your friend here, Judith. When people look at you it reflects bad on me. They don't think you have a mirror or a friend. And they know we're friends. My friends don't look like this. They look like this. Ava, I think I look really pretty today. I tried. I put on a little extra makeup. That's not makeup. That's make down. I'm matching today, too. You know, you told me about that. So you see this gold belt? The gold belt goes with the gold flappy things on my shoes. And the blue shoes go with the blue dress. Oh, my God! What? You're wearing flats? My foot's all... It hurts a little bit. Push me out of the window, why don't you? I would love to. Harley's here. Come on, we gotta go. Enough with the coffee. No coffee breath. Come on. No, no. Nope. We gotta go. Hi, Harley. Hey- Hey there. How's your foot? It's fine. Thanks. Thanks for helping out the other day, too. Yeah, no problem. Brice just couldn't believe you were so nice to me. He wanted me to thank you for that. Yeah, no worries. You changed your hair! Little bit. I like it. Thank you. Happy birthday. Thank you. You like the flowers? You sent these? Yeah. Don't look so disappointed. No, it's just... lt just said "Happy birthday, Judith." It didn't say who it was from. No, I wanted to tell you in person. I was gonna deliver them myself when I came up, but I just didn't really think that was a good idea. Yeah. Smart man. Yes. Okay. Come here for a second. Let's sit down. - Have a seat. - All right. Harley, I'm gonna be as honest as I can be. What's going on? You have plenty of programmers, plenty of employees that could come and help me with this project. And yet you're coming here every day. Why? Judith, I find you extremely beautiful, okay? And interesting. And if I have to come here myself to be around you, I will. I just wanna be involved with you. Intimately. And as long as you know that I'm very married... Point taken. He loves you. I saw that when he picked you up. He's kinda regular. But lucky. You just don't impress me as the type of person that would be satisfied with a man like that. Maybe at one point in time, in your life. But where you're going, I just don't see that lasting. You don't know him. - Hi. - Hey. Crazy day today. Yeah? Yeah. I was trying to finish up all that inventory. Babe, I'm sorry. It's the second year in a row, Brice. Babe, I just got a little carried away with work, that's all. Yeah. I understand. It's all good. No, no, let me take you out or something. No. I have this really big assignment for work and I got a lot to do. Babe, I'm sorry. Brice, it's okay. Don't worry about it. She may be weary Them young girls They do get weary Wearing that same old shaggy dress Yeah But when she gets weary Try a little tenderness Yeah, yeah Oh, now, now You won't regret it No, no Young girls They don't forget it Love is their own happiness You're silly. But it's all so easy All you gotta do is try Try a little tenderness All you got to do is, man Hold her when you wanna Happy birthday, baby. I'm sorry. All right, girls, let's make some dreams happen. Judith, you have been requested to accompany Harley to New Orleans for a meeting. Really? Yes. He's presenting to his shareholders and he wants you there. Okay, well, when do we leave? Oh, no, darling, just you. I think he likes you. Now, I know you're married, but just flirt a little. Get the deal closed. Don't compromise yourself. But just flirt. I understand. I know I don't know you very well, but I want you to know exactly what you're getting yourself into. This is a big deal for me and this place. And I want it in the worst way. That being said, I will tell you like I tell all my girls who go out with my guys. Be nice. Be aware. Have fun. But most of all, be careful. I know you're a smart girl, but this is another league you're in. Trust me. A couple of senatorial retirement announcements this week, highlighting what has been a gradual rolling back of the GOP's... Hello. Can I help you? Hi. Do you think you can tell me how to get to Johnson Jewelry? I'm a little turned around. I'm kind of new in town. You want East Jefferson. This is West Jefferson. That's on the other side of town. Thank you. Thank you so much. What? We're back to this again? Did you not have a good birthday or something? My husband forgot. He forgot? I thought he sent you flowers yesterday. No, they weren't from him. He didn't even remember. I mean, he tried. It's just the second year in a row. You are forgettable. Honey, you have to make a man remember you. I've tried to give you my assistance, but you don't want it, so get out. All right, you win. Win what? The hair, the makeup, the clothes. Do whatever you wanna do. Are you kidding? Oh, my God. Thank you. I have been dying to get my hands on this hair. Come on. Come on. Look. Look at the bags, the shoes, purses, everything. I dream of this room. Look at this. Where are we right now? This is the place that Janice sends the girls that she's not happy with before, you know, she sets them up. So this is what I call Couture Heaven. All right, let's get started. Wow. There's so much to do with you in so little time. What do you think of this? Wow. What kind of fabric is this? One that's never been on your back. It's called expensive. Good morning. Good morning. What's wrong? Her ex came in here. Tell him, honey. I've been hiding from him. Running from him for years. Changed my name. I moved here and... I can't believe he's here. I'm gonna have to quit. Well, where are you gonna go? I don't know. I'm tired of starting over. Look, maybe he just stumbled in here on accident. Do you know how many people live in this city? You can't keep running from someone your whole life. You don't understand. When we first met, he wined and dined me. Made me feel like I was the luckiest woman in the world. Then things started to unravel. And I don't know if it was the drugs or if he was really mentally ill. He just started to change. And just became evil. Like he was two different people. He tried to kill me. I just can't see you being with a guy like that. Sometimes you never know who you're married to. People start off one way and end up somebody else. One night, he was on that couch... I ran and I never looked back after that. Look, Melinda, you can't quit. What am I supposed to do? We'll help you. We'll pick you up and drop you off. We? Miss Waco. What? I'll help you. Yeah, he'll protect you. Don't throw away what you found here. Do you know what we all need? Is a Valium. I have a whole room full of them. Good morning. Thank you. Please watch your step. Hello. Hi. You gonna fly standing up or you gonna have a seat? Yeah. Right. I Will. All right. So, is this your plane? Like, it all is? - Like, all the parts and everything. - Yeah. Wow. That's cool. You know, I was thinkin'. When we leave New Orleans, maybe we can head over to Paris. Or New York. All this work we're trying to focus on and you're talking about Paris and New York? If you were mine, you wouldn't have to work. If you were mine, you wouldn't be on this plane right now. Your butt would be at a pharmacy. That's the handout for the board meeting. Champagne, sir? Thank you. You're welcome. - Something for you? - Thanks, I'm fine. Look at you. Champagne. Private jet. You look amazing, by the way. Man, this view is just incredible. What? It's just refreshing to see someone experience this side of life for the first time. You know? it is. it excites me. Whatever. You know you take people on this plane all the time and excite them. Just my ex. This was no big deal for her. I really hate being taken for granted. Don't you? Yeah. How would that make you feel when she would do that? The opposite of how this makes you feel. How does this make me feel? Special. Important. Wanted. Am I right? You should feel that way all the time. This stuff didn't matter to her. The more I tried, the more she shot me down. I think I just love too hard. I do. I fall. Before I know it, I'm just... I'm gone. What do you mean, "gone"? Just crazy. Crazy in love. You know? So I've learned to keep my true feelings inside because most women can't handle the kind of emotion that I bring. What does that mean? Well, I can come on really strong. How so? I want to make love to you. Right now. That's the kind of thing I'd say to her. You are so beautiful. Thank you. What? I was talking about my ex. But you are beautiful, though. You are. You are. Thank you. One compliment does deserve another. I think we are better off just keeping it professional. You know we're way past that. I find myself very attracted to you. I find myself very married. Happily married, right? A guy can dream, right? I can't stop you from dreaming. What do you dream about? I used to dream about helping people and starting my own practice. But I graduated college and reality hit. I don't really dream anymore. You know all that could easily be reality. What do you dream about? You. You ever dream about me? I have a husband. Yeah. I know. Do you want me? What are you doing? Harley, stop it. I don't want to. Harley, stop it. Please, Harley. Please. Stop. Get off of me. Get off of me! Get! Get off of me! Just stop! Stop it. Stop. - You stop. - Stop it. Now you can say you resisted. Are you okay? I don't wanna ever see you again. If you need anything, Janice can help you. Okay, Judith, hold on a second, please. - I will not do this. I can't. - Wait. Judith, are you sure about this? - Wait a second. - I mean it. Wait, wait. Let me talk to you real quick. Hold on. Are you sure you want to do this? Really? - Thank you, son. - No problem. Judith. Hey- Harley, you remember my husband, Brice. Hey, how you doin', man? Hi. That is a beautiful car. Thank you. Hey, Mama. This your mother? Harley. Reverend Sarah Ogalvee. It's a pleasure. Thanks so much for the ride, Harley. Appreciate that. Okay. Y'all have a good night. Yeah. Let's get you in, Miss Sarah. All right, son. Hi, Mom. Sweetheart, how you doin'? - You made it, huh? - So happy to see you. Sweetness, that was an awfully pretty dress I saw you in earlier. - Yeah, you looked nice, babe. - Thanks. My boss gave it to me. She wants us to start dressing like that. You're not gonna say grace? Okay, yeah. God, thank you for this food. Bless it and purify it. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. In Jesus' name we pray. And we thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen. Miss Sarah, I'm always happy when you're around. I get to have a home-cooked meal. Daughter, you not cooking for your husband? Yes, I am. Well, she does, but lately, she's been working a lot. Right. With the man in the red, fast car? No. I mean, I don't work with him that often. And you know, he's a nice guy. Nice guy? That don't mean nothin' if he don't know the Lord. "It's easier for a camel to enter into the eye of a needle "than it is for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven." Yes, Mama, I know. You say that a lot. But there's nothing wrong with being rich or having nice things. Long as nice things don't have you. Amen. Well, our business is over anyway, so... Well, then that's good, isn't it? Yeah. You know, baby, it's been a long time since you been to the house of the Lord. I told her we rest on Sundays. You know, with your job, you need to be in church. Could build spiritual strength up to deal with those demons, girl. I don't work with demons. Isn't that what you said to me on the phone? I know, but... Okay, I guess I was wrong. Mama, not everybody's a demon. Well, I know that. I'm just voicing my concern. We don't talk anymore. You don't call in for your morning prayers. Well, it's just I get up so early. You know, I have to take the bus every morning. At 9:00 a.m. Prayer starts at 6:00 a.m. every morning. All the sisters be on the line. I know you busy, baby. I know that, but you could call in sometime. Just once in a while. All right, I will. I will. How long you staying? I done got on your nerves. I'm sorry, please forgive me. You're not bothering me. It's fine. I'm just gonna go dry my hair. Everything all right, sweetness? Yeah. I just don't wanna catch a cold. That's not like her not to want her food. Yeah, I think she's mad at me, Miss Sarah. I forgot her birthday and now I'm talking about her cooking. How you goin' forget her birthday? You need your ass whipped. Miss Sarah, you ain't supposed to be cursin'. That's the King James Version. It's all right, honey. Eat your food. You all right? I can't believe you. What did I do now? Why would you tell her all that stuff? She asked. And you know how your mother is. I can't lie to her. - Whatever. -It's like she looks right through me. You know what? I'm going to bed. Do I need to go get my guitar? Good night. Is it important for your partner to support your hobbies? Yes. I think it's very important for me for that to happen, yeah. Yeah, I think over the years, with all my concentration on my business, on success, I was afraid that I would give up a part of myself, if I... Are you listening to me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I... You don't want someone that's gonna change you. Yeah. Jeff stepping in front. He's coming back, doing battle against his old squad. Play action. Down the middle. intercepted. Come on! - Babe, you see that? - Intercepted by Kleinsmith. Don't throw the ball in all that traffic. Down the sidelines, out of bounds, across the 45 yard line of... Indiana to 47. Joe Kleinsmith. He gets up limping off that play. But he's got an interception and a 38 yard return. Kleinsmith doing a nice job of just reading the eyes of the quarterback. Quarterback's gonna tell you where he's going with the ball. So is this what you wanted, huh? You wanted to just have sex with me and just ignore me after that? You come to the office. You don't say "Hi." You don't call anybody. You were the one that said you were married and you couldn't do this, right? Right? Why does it even matter if I call you or not, Judith? Really? Why are you doing this? What are you talking about? I'm not a man that likes to play these little silly games, Judith. I'm not playing any games. Well, if you want me, then you say it. All right? Live for once in your life, Judith, damn, come on! It's not that easy. Okay? Where is he right now? He's watching the game. Touchdown! Yes! Put him on the phone. Will you stop it? No, put him on the phone, Judith. No. Just stop it. Why doesn't he wonder who you're talking to on the phone right now? Because he doesn't do that. If you were mine, I'd want to know. Well, I'm not yours, am I? Well, you could be. Does he make love to you better than me? I don't think anyone makes love better than you. Tell me you want me. Say it. I want you. Come see me right now. I'll pick you up on the corner of Wilmont and 3rd. I can't. I can't be there. I'm making dinner. And it's what? It's 8:30. I just can't. Hello? Hello? Pass the ball! Look out! Leslie Majors on the run. Inside the Sycamore 40, out of bounds. Dinner's ready, honey. Mom, I'm sorry, that was my boss. She just called. She needs me to run an errand. What? I know, it's ridiculous. I'll see y'all later. Well... ...coming back for the football, breaking off his route. Going down, getting the feet inbounds. You see it there. - That happen a lot? - No, no, no! Lewis able to pick up. Can he make... Here you go. What's that? You really are from the country, aren't you? You've never even tried this before. Let me give you a little bit. No,no,no. I'm just gonna stick with the wine. You trust me, right? Of course. Go ahead. All right, Well... I've been thinking. Instead of going into business with Janice. You and me, we should start that marriage counselor thing. Get that office open. I'd do that for you. - Are you serious? Really? - Yeah. You would do that? One catch, though. You have to be mine. What do I do about Brice though? Okay, we talked about Brice, babe. You leave him. Harley, I already feel so bad though, about what we're doing. Then why are you here? You know why I'm here. Why don't you just go home? Get out of my house. Shit if I'm gon' try and play these little games with you. No, go. What are you talking about? Go. You realize that you're kicking me out your house. You know what? Fine then. Forget it. Asshole! Fine! Fine! Don't ever ask me to cook or come over again. Bastard! Don't call me again, you jackass. You comin' in awfully late. - Where's Brice? - What's wrong with you? Nothing, Mama. My boss made me upset. Brice is in the bed. What's wrong with you? I'm just gonna take a shower, okay? You been drinking? I had a glass of wine. All right? With that devil in the red car. No, not with him. And he ain't no devil. Who you think you talkin' to? You know you never could lie to me. I'm your mother. God's not pleased with this, daughter. I knew when you moved here. I knew the devil was gon' be after you. I just knew it. And look at you. You're fallen. Look at you, you're changing. Please, baby, come back. Now, you know I taught you the ways of the Lord. You know better. Come on out here, now. Come pray with me. Okay, Mama. I'll come out there and I'll pray with you. But then what? Am I supposed to stop wearing makeup? And wear dresses down to my ankle, and pretend like I'm all holy and happy, and sanctified for the Lord like you do? Nobody's pretending, baby. Yeah, well, I'm just saying it don't take all that to love the Lord. Why you so disrespectful to me? I'm just saying what my father shoulda told you long ago. Now, you can just leave him right outta this. God bless the dead. God bless the dead? So, Mama, we're still doing that act? When you gon' quit it? We both know he's still alive. Yeah. I found him in Youngstown, Mama. And he told me all about you. And how you left him the second you joined that church. How you kept him outta my life. So what do you gotta lie about it for? You trying to turn this all around on me. But it's not about me. It's about you. That fool out there, 'bout to make a bigger fool outta you. That boy is gonna hurt you somethin' bad. And he gon' take you straight to hell. Well, I'll enjoy the ride. Where you get that smart mouth from? How dare you talk to me like that? I done worked my fingers to the bone to make sure you had a decent life. I done cleaned more toilets than you can think of and then you would talk to your mother like this? Not today. Not today! What's going on? Well, you know my mother. She feels that the devil is after me, so she in there hollerin'. "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, "I will fear no evil. "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures." Brice, I need you take care of my child. I will, but tell me what's going on. God, Lord, Jesus and the Host. - Judith, what's going on? - Please, not you, too. Judith, I've never seen her or you act like this. Talk to me. Brice, okay, I just want to go take a shower. It's really not that deep. No, Judith, Judith, talk to me. Please. Judith, talk to me. Judith! Judith! Please! Wait a minute. Those are not my hand-me-downs. No, they are not. Take that for me. Oh, my God. You caught on. Wait a minute. Wait. You caught on. Let me see. - I am so proud. - Like it? Yes? This is my finest moment in life. - Is Janice in? - Yes. Hi. What, you don't knock? Just the person I wanted to see. Have a seat. No, I'll stand. I wanted to thank you for the job, but this will be my last week. No. This is your last day. I just got a call from Harley, telling me that he's out of the deal with me and opening a practice for you. That's what we plan to do. We? Little girl, you have no idea what you are in for. But I wish you all the best with your struggle. You know, I've been meaning to tell you, you are in an existential identity crisis. I did my research on you. You spent those two weeks in Paris and all of a sudden you got a French accent? Girl, we know you from Georgia. Bitch, you better get your ass outta my office. Now! That should do it. - Thank you. - Thank you. What's going on? You okay? Yeah. Why are you so quiet? I'm sorry. Brice, what's the matter? Melinda, I'm fine. No, you're not. Come on. Everything you done for me here, let me return the favor. What's going on? I think I lost my wife. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Are you sure? I can't even believe it. I don't know what I did wrong. I didn't know it was that bad. I just thought that... Brice, sometimes we can get comfortable with people. And that's what causes the problems. That's how it is. But I didn't even know she was unhappy. Well, she probably wasn't. Most times you're happy until somebody comes along and shows you something different. Maybe I did take her for granted. Well, say you did. But this is wrong. This is wrong of her, man. You don't deserve this. You can't take the responsibility for what she did. Because when people cheat... I never said she was cheating. She's cheating. Miss Waco, I didn't... Calm down! But the lesbian is right. Lesbian? I'm not a lesbian. You're not? I'm sorry. I thought that you... The boots and the sweater. You know, she's met somebody that's making her look at life differently. Face it! So what do I do? If you see a mob fighting with bricks, you don't join in the fight unless you have one, too. May I help you? You have a prescription? Hey, I wanna go home with you. Judith! - Hey, Brice. - Come on, let's go. Go home. Judith, let's go, now! Get up! I don't think she wants to go with you. Judith, let's go! - Baby, I'm getting tired of this. - Baby? Get up. - Get up. - Hey! Hey! Hey! Get offa me. Get your damn hands offa me! Get offa me! What is wrong with you? Get your damn hands off of me! Have you lost your mind? Maybe. I'm at home waiting on you. And this is what you're doing? Well, stop waiting, Brice. This is how you do me? You're messing around with this clown. Baby, you don't know how much I love you. Baby, come home. If you come home, I promise you I'll never mention it again. Just come home, please. Please. Oh, you're such a good guy. And I really hope you find a nice girl. What are you saying to me? I feel so dead with you, Brice. I do. And I wanna feel alive. I wanna feel wanted. I don't. You took me for granted. You did. I don't just want a good guy. I want a phenomenal guy. You're not phenomenal. What are you... What are you saying to me? We have someone I can pay to help you through this and help counsel you. What? Judith, you're not saying this to me. I tried. I loved you. I wanted to love you. And I'm sorry if I failed. I'm sorry. Fine. I will help you pack your shit. I don't need anything. I'll just get my laptop. I have everything I need, everything I could ask for here. Bye. Here you go. How are you doing? You okay? No. I understand what you're going through. She was just so cold. She wasn't herself. Her mother warned me. She was right. Brice, I'm so sorry. I know this pain. What are you doing? We're not attracted to each other. Okay, you're just hurting and you'll do anything to make the pain go away. Trust me. I've been there. I'm sorry. I know it hurts right now. And I'm not gon' lie to you, it's gon' hurt for a long time, and it's gon' seem like it's forever. But you're gonna get through this. I promise. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You coming up? Hell, yeah, I'm comin' up. I wanna see how this dude has you livin'. Well, he should be at work, so he's not home. Hey, move it! You're blocking the road! Go around. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Oh, my Jesus. We have to go. Forgive us our sins. Lead all souls to you, Lord. Especially those in most need of Thy Divine Mercy, Lord. No, no. Let's have a little fun with this. Hello, Reverend. Save my child! Sisters. Oh, the Lord done answered my prayers, sisters. - My child is home. - I'm getting my computer. Sweet baby, please stay. Please stay. You're not safe. I brought all the sisters here to pray for you. - We need you to stay here. - I'm fine, Mama. I know you think you are, but you're not, darling. - Okay. We gon' go. All right? I love you. - You're in danger. Let's go. - No, sweetie. - Mom, give me this. I need it Please, stay here. I'm begging you. - There's something on this. - Mama, we need to get... - Stop it! - Damn! Satan! Give me that now. What the hell? Mama, you okay? You okay? - You're good, right? Stand up. - My sweet baby! Now you see what I mean? No, he didn't mean it. He didn't mean it. You need to stay here with me, baby, please. - Get up. Get up! - Get your hands off my baby! - I'm talking to her! - Mama, hold on now. Get up. Girl, get up. Sister Sarah, you tried. You tried. I don't know if she's hurt. I don't know if her bruised knee is okay. I don't know nothin' because you just jacked me outta there! Bring your ass back here. Come back here. You come back. Get the hell off me! Don't you touch me! - Whose side are you on? - She's my mother, you jerk! I don't give a damn about your mama, Judith! Yeah, obviously, you don't! The way you pushed her down! - Get up the stairs! - Don't touch me! Get up the stairs if I wanna get up the stairs. So you just gon' take her side like that? Huh? - Take her side? - Yeah! This is not about me taking her side, Harley. It's the fact that you will not understand what it feels like to watch your mother thrown to the ground! Look, just because your mother abandoned you in some crack house, don't mean you gotta abuse mine! I don't give a damn what she did. It ain't about what she did. Shoot, yes, she annoys me, too. She's still my mother. Where is my shit, bitch? She don't deserve to be treated that way. Judith, you know that I'm just crazy in love with you, okay? And it just... lt just makes me really upset when you're not on my side, okay? I'm gonna just give you some space right now. You leaving? Judith? It's just, this really is not healthy. You gon' leave me? Is that what you gonna do? - What the hell are you... - Is that what you gon' do? What do you know about cooking? Boy, this is what I do. Thank you. Don't mention it. I didn't want yo' ass to jump. I'm not gonna jump. Good. It hurts like hell, though. I know. I know where you are. You can cook. You're a good woman. You think you'll ever find love again? You can't run from that guy forever. I believe in love and marriage and I really hope you find a nice guy. Brice... I have HIV. - Melinda, I'm sorry. -It's okay. I'm dealing with it. I made the choice to be with my ex. Even though I knew he was sleeping around, so I accepted my part in it. I'm taking my meds, so I'm doing good. But to answer your question... No. I'm not running from Harley anymore. Harley? Yeah, the Class-Meet guy. - What's wrong? - Judith. - What? What's the matter? - Judith! - Judith! - Judith? What about Judith? - My wife is with him! - Okay, okay. Oh, my God. Judith! Judith! No. No, no, no, no. Judith, baby, it's me. It's Brice. No, no, no, it's me. I'm gonna take you home. I'm taking you home. It's me, baby. Brice! - Yeah. - I knew you'd come. He did this to you? I deserve it. You don't deserve this. - Yes, I do. - No, you don't. I was so mean to you. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. You think we can fix it? We can fix it, right? We'll fix it. Okay. Where are you hurt? Right here. I hurt your heart. It's okay. Come on, babe, I'm gonna get you home. I'm gonna get you outta here. I'm gonna get you outta here. Come on. It's okay. L 90'! YOU- I got you. I got you. My God! Careful. Get up. Get up! Oh, my God. Brice, stop, you gon' kill him. Karen. Yeah. It's me, Karen. I knew you'd come back. Come here, girl. Don't you ever come near her or my wife again. Karen. Karen. I'm sorry. I know you have to go. Wow. What happened to Judith? Well... She's alive. How does this story end? It's still being written. Did she get HIV, too? Yes. Brice?? No. Thank you so much for sharing this story with me. I'm gonna end this "almost" affair and stay with my husband. Karen. Hey. Hi. How are you? Good to see you. Hi. ls Brice here? - Yeah. He's in the back. - Okay. - Thanks. - Good seeing you. - You look nice. - Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? I'm good. I spoke to your doctor. He changed your dosage to get your T-cell count up. Okay. How are you feeling? I'm fine. I'm good. Where you headed to? I'm going to church. Mama's there waiting for me. Okay. Well, be careful. And if you ever need anything, I'm here for you, Judith. - See you next month. - I'll see you next month. - Hi. - Hey. Hi, little man. He's so cute. - Hi. - How are you? Hey- How's my little man?
