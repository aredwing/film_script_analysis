You knew that if you had a baseball game or, I don't know, some sort of special event, there was always a good chance he might not be there. I mean, don't get me wrong, he was there a good amount of the time. Just not all the time. I remember I tried to trick him into thinking I had ESP. Or that I was moving stuff around with my mind, hoping it might get him to pay a little more attention. And he'd play along for a few minutes, but... then he'd leave for work. I was four... when it happened. So I don't have too many memories of my father. I kinda remember what it felt like to be with him. Talking with me, holding me. One thing I've always remembered is this game we used to play on nights when he'd put me to bed. He'd ask all these questions about animals. How many eyes does a fish have? And I'd say, "Two." How many noses does a monkey have? How many ears does a gopher have? That's really all there was to it. I remember thinking it was fun. We got married in 1965. I wanted children right away, but Henry wanted to wait. 'Cause it was about that time that he was starting the institute. And then he had a different research lab job at the same time so we could make rent. He worked a lot. Even after we had both kids. But he loved it. You know? A man has the right to love his work. Our goal was to conduct unbiased, empirical research on exceptional human abilities. Psychokinesis, ESP, precognition. Things that are typically considered fringe science or parapsychology. Dr. West, and the rest of us, quite frankly, all believed that there was real science to be discovered in these areas. We had a good time doing what we were doing. We were underfunded, of course, but we were still relatively young, so it didn't matter. In the first few years alone, we published close to 30 journal articles between us. And there were some truly exceptional cases. All documented. Well, we did a lot of different kinds of tests, but... probably the most effective one to measure clairvoyant abilities were the Zener cards. This one? It's the lines. The wavy lines. Well, if you select each card at random, then the success ratio will be close to 20%. But we had several subjects whose ratio was closer to 30%. And that might not seem like very much, but if you realize that we did each test over 200 times, you begin to understand the virtual impossibility of that figure. I think we were all secretly hoping to discover the next Nina Kulagina. She was a woman from the former Soviet Union. Truly remarkable. Nina's psychokinetic abilities were probably the most well-documented and they stood up to the strictest of scrutiny. The closest we encountered to that level was Norman LeClair. French-Canadian man. Norman's PK abilities were astounding at times. That's how it works. Pretty simple? Yeah. Try to vibrate the game board. It's all right. Take your time. That's all right. You gave it your best shot. We can try again later. Dr. West brought in colleagues, some well-known and esteemed researchers at the time, to observe Norman. All the necessary steps were taken to prevent any claims of researcher bias or improper testing methods. All outside variables were controlled, for this was to be the moment the snickering, the talking behind hands would finally stop. This was proof. - God, I can't believe that. - Explain that. - As we said. - How do you explain that one? How do you explain that? - What do you guys think? - Oh, my God. Oh, they were clearly impressed. Even though, I'd have to say, they didn't really allow themselves to show it. I was happy. I was happy for Henry. He had worked so hard for that moment. But then, just before the researchers left... one of them noticed something odd on the wristwatch of one of our research assistants. And it turned out that this watch had been rigged with a small neodymium magnet. And every one of our tests involved metal in some capacity. Even the trace amounts of iron in the cereal. And this guy had been complicit with Norman's ruse right from the start. Right under our noses. It was... it was a crushing blow. For the institute's credibility and for Henry's reputation. It was... it was awful. Is there... something else we should know about? Judith? With you? It's like... it's like being in a well sometimes. I can see it, I can hear it, but nobody knows I'm there. I'd... I'd like to help you. Whatever is going on. Judith was first brought to the institute in September of 1976 by her sister... sister Margaret. She had been reading about the work we were doing in a small magazine or something. And she thought we would be interested in testing Judith. The first thing she did when she walked in was she told me it was my birthday. Which caught me a bit off guard. Not because it was my birthday. It wasn't, it was the day before. Maybe it was a guess. You see, that's something you always have to guard against with the work we did. Lucky guesses. False positives. If you let yourself fall victim to a belief bias of any kind, that's when you start forcing the pieces together. Even when they don't fit at all. Judith... she seemed average. She's in her early 40s. Can't say there's anything particularly remarkable about her appearance. She was kind of the type of person that you would pass by on the street in any town. You might say hello, smile, but that's about it. You would have no idea that Judith was what she was. I was older than her by seven years. She was a silly kid. And we had a lot of fun. There was one day, she was around 35, she slipped on a patch of ice on the sidewalk and hurt her back pretty badly. And after that, she had a little trouble moving, and getting around. And her pain was consistent. It was chronic. It was enough that my husband and I decided that she shouldn't be living alone anymore. So she moved in with us and the kids. About a year after Judith moved in, she began to withdraw. I mean, she would stay in her room for days. I'm not sure she would even eat. I don't know what she did when she was alone. She was reading some very unusual books. And that's when it all started. And I knew things weren't right. There were things... there were things that I saw her do that I just... I had to do something. And to this day, part of me still regrets doing what I did, but I had to. But Dr. West was intrigued with Judith almost immediately. We all were. By this point, we'd researched hundreds of cases, brought in almost as many subjects into the lab. Judith was different, though. We just had no idea how different at this point. Can you tell us your name, please? - Judith Winstead. - And what's your date of birth, Judith? February 18th, 1935. And your marital status? - I'm not married. - Have you ever been? Okay. How many siblings do you have? - One. - Are your parents still alive? - Judith, are your parents still alive? - No. Okay. Are you right-handed or left-handed? Judith's behavior was always odd. Even from the first day she arrived. But in our field, it wasn't uncommon to encounter odd people. So we didn't give it much thought. Ms. Winstead? Right-handed. And when did you first realize you had certain abilities? Are you... are you all right, dear? You're bleeding. Oh, my God. - Here's some... - Give her some towels. Oh, tilt your head back, okay? It's not her nose, it's her hand. Her hand is bleeding. What? Did you... did you bite yourself? Why? Susan, let's get her... get her to the ladies' room, please. As long as you're okay with it. - That's all right. Just take... - Just take care of her. Judith? What is she... no, no, no. What is she doing? Stop. - Just stop. Calm down. - Let go. Ms. Winstead. Judith, stop, please. Well, for starters, Judith came to us in an unusual way. Most times, we learn of someone and seek them out. We had no idea Judith was even out there. Nevertheless, she tested beyond what any of us thought was even possible. There was no measure. Truly no measure for her abilities. If you can, try for seven this time. Any combination. Three and four. One and six. Three and four. One and six. Two and five. Judith, what I'd like you to try to do is to move the wheel without actually touching it. Try to concentrate your mind. Focus your thoughts. She outperformed every subject we'd ever studied. There was no comparison to be made. I understand how peculiar it might seem to hear her abilities described in this way, but they were godlike. Okay, Judith, what do you see this time? - Judith? - Star. - And this time. - Square. And what do you see this time? Judith, are you all right? Are you all right, Judith? Do you... can we continue with the exercise? - I think she's... - Judith? I think she's okay. All right, let's resume. Judith, what... - The card bent. - What? - That card bent. We're taking a break. - What do you mean? Dr. West? Looking back, I... I guess I should've known better. I mean, yes, we'd seen... witnessed amazing things in the past. But nothing like that. Nothing, nothing like that. Inverse square law. Conservation of momentum. These were well-established laws of physics that were being violated. The second law of thermodynamics. All of these. We should've been scared. Someone with that much power would... but we were too excited to be scared. We finally had the proof... not another hoax... that we'd been seeking for years. We had our Nina Kulagina. What I remember, she was due to... stay overnight in the lab through the weekend. We did this quite often with subjects because anomalous events sometimes occur during the deep-sleep cycle. And we monitored the subjects through the night using various recording devices. During Judith's first overnight, we only had one staff member present. Kenneth. I don't ever think I knew his last name. He was a graduate student at the time. Nice, quiet kid. Came from a farming family. I remember that because so do I. He was... he was alone with Judith that night sitting not far from her bed. I don't even think he knew that he was being recorded because you can see him smoking which he wasn't supposed to be doing in the lab. Nothing happened for hours. Nobody ever found out what happened. But whatever did... that was it for him. Never came back. We tried contacting Judith's sister, Margaret. We couldn't reach her. She'd disconnected her phone. It became clear at that moment... that Margaret had abandoned her. The decision now was what we were gonna do. I could tell that Lawrence was already reaching a bit of a breaking point. It was obvious. It wasn't so obvious with Dr. West. Not to me anyway. We simply made the decision that we were going to continue our testing with her. But after that night, it became extremely difficult. It was so unnerving. Her behavior. It was so incredibly... She... she would say things and do things that made you... She would scream in that voice. Grab her! It wasn't hers. It was like an animal. Henry seemed most affected by it. He tried his best to shield the others from that. I knew him well enough to know that he was deeply affected. I watched my father change firsthand. And I have no doubt whatsoever that what happened in that lab caused that change. I remember being in the seventh grade years later, and other kids making fun of me. Call him crazy. They'd say I'd be crazy. Back then, it was different than it is now. Now everyone has a therapist. They go for anything... stubbed toe. But back then, you went if it was something bad. And especially if medication was involved. And in my husband's case, it was. - Why do you say that, Henry? - You don't understand. Okay. - I see what's happening. - At work? I can't help you if you don't tell me - what you think is happening. - I can't tell you. What are you so afraid of, Henry? I know it's very trying, but we would really like to continue. - Can you please stop that, Judith? - Can you please stop that, please? We'd really like to continue... We had about 10 different degrees between us. Including one in medicine, three in psychology. And we knew... that was not normal. Judith was not a typical test subject. She had made that abundantly clear by that point. And I felt we needed help. I received a file from another analyst. It was something he thought I should take a look at. We started a program to investigate psi in the early '70s. Psi-related phenomenon. About five years after KGB conducted similar studies. I didn't have the highest expectations going in. I felt we'd already been down that road. And it proved to be a waste of time and money. But Marcus was a friend of a friend, and so I went. It's difficult to explain. But you could feel something... a weight, an invisible weight. The whole lab took on that feeling the minute he stepped through the door. It was if he represented a challenge to her, to her power. Everything we had seen up until that point, everything Judith had done, everything we'd witnessed, it barely compared to what happened after he arrived. I assumed they'd run through the usual battery of psi tests. The cards, the elaborate devices with the numbers, but they didn't. They told me that those tests weren't right for her. This here's a way to convince anyone. Easiest and simplest way to begin the demonstration. Now you understand why we've called you in here. That can't be accounted for through any known rational explanation. And she's able to repeat it with a variety of different materials. Breaking the third law of thermal dynamics. By the time the man from the Defense Intelligence Agency, Robert Koepp, arrived, we'd given up on our standard testing procedure. Well, we'd simply talked to her. It was so difficult. She knew... too much. Think of any object. - Something in the room? - No, it doesn't have to be. No, let's make it something not in the room. - Okay. - Okay. Draw what you see, please. - And what object were you thinking of? - A hammer. - Excuse me. - Susan? - Susan. - Henry, she... You don't frighten me! - You don't fucking know! - Susan! Stop it! - What are you doing?! - Marcus! - Susan, calm down. - How dare you?! - You don't know anything! - Take her outside, please. Just take her outside. She had drawn a shamrock. Back in 1973, three years earlier, I had traveled back to London for my mum's funeral. I was devastated. Her family had immigrated to London from Ireland and she was very proud of her Irish heritage. And in her casket, she had worn the same brooch that she'd worn almost every day of her life. It was a shamrock. As soon as I saw that picture, I realized what Judith had whispered to me. "You weren't there." Which is true, I wasn't. My mother died the day before I made it home. And that woman... that thing somehow knew that. And how much guilt. She wanted me to behave that way. She wanted me to react that way. To humiliate me in front of my peers by turning me into everything I had tried so hard not to be. Well, the incident with Susan was very unsettling because it demonstrated Judith's ability to influence us. She was definitely influencing Henry. He started to pull back. Which was unlike him. I thought he was gonna fight the government's involvement, but that didn't happen. He withdrew and they took over. My arm! Use the strap right there. Please, step back. You're gonna break her arm. - Please, step back. - What are you giving her? Tell Robert. Heartbeat's back again. Mark it. 14 minutes and 27 seconds. - Any physical deterioration? - Nothing. Jesus. She's pissing again. Get the towels. It's over there. Get it. - No. - That's good. Thank you. Step back. Check her! Make sure she's all right! Not that, that. Once they witnessed the things we'd all seen, it became a very different scenario. It didn't matter what my preconceived notions were before visiting the institute. What mattered now was national security. We left nothing to chance. All evidence was thoroughly reviewed by top Defense Department analysts. Tissue samples were extracted. Blood samples taken. Plans were immediately put in place to contain the situation. The institute was locked down. We assumed control of all testing and information collection. Strict security protocols were put in place. This was a coordinated military effort with support from the highest levels of the government. Soldiers were stationed around the clock inside the lab, all of them armed. We were there because we believed it. Now we wanted to see it. The camera's ready. - Lights ready. - Flashing. I think he's having a seizure. Henry? - Get a hand under his head. - Turn the lights on. - Keep his mouth open. - Turn the lights on! Where is she? Stop the flashing now! The DIA report prompted swift action. We looked at the evidence, we reviewed the footage of the seizure incident. Dr. West had no history of epilepsy or any related condition, so it's highly unlikely that the flashing lights could've triggered it. We could not say definitively that Ms. Winstead caused the seizure, but we certainly couldn't rule it out either. Several meetings were held to discuss the seriousness of this threat. I can't speak to the specifics of what was discussed, but suffice it to say if you're gonna inform the White House of something as crazy as this, you better be damn sure it's true. All psychological and pharmacological explanations were ruled out. Her blood samples came back with impossibly high electrolyte levels. A completely unknown molecular compound was found in her tissue. Something was inside her. No doubt about that. Not a disease. Not a parasite. An evil. Do you think you know what caused the seizure? - Henry? - Yes. - Are you taking the new medication? - It has nothing to do with that. - Henry, it is important that you keep... - I am taking it. I'm seeing things at night. I can't stop thinking about everything. I try, but... And even when I'm with my family, I feel it. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of what might happen to them. But, yes, I am taking the new medication. The story was that when the KGB learned about Nina Kulagina's ability, they performed a test with a living frog. This was back in 1970. The Soviets wanted to see if Nina could telekinetically affect the bioelectrical impulses in living tissue. To speed up and slow down its heartbeat. And allegedly, she did. So our government wanted to see if they could replicate those results with Judith. Good God. Jesus. - Why's he barking? - It's her. She's still doing it. She's doing it to the dog. No, her! Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights! Where is she? Secure this room now. Right now! - Quiet. Quiet. - Turn on the lights! Quiet! Everyone, quiet. Don't move. - Robert, what's happening? - Take it down. Quiet. Quiet. Marcus. - Nobody move. Nobody move. - Who's touching me? Turn on the light! Turn on the light now. - Turn it on. - Turn that light back on. Grab her! Imagine being 22, 23 years old, best shape of your life, armed to the teeth. And you scared of some lady looked like she could've been your primary school teacher. That's what was going on then. You understand? Things took a significant turn after that. I think in total, there were... six or seven unexplainable incidents that occurred. All outside the institute. One of the government researcher's cousins almost died in a car wreck. There was... a soldier's father was attacked by a dog. There was a house fire, if I remember correctly. And on and on it went. Now, each of these things on their own could be a coincidence, but the likelihood that all of them would happen together to the family and friends of this same group of people in the same span of time is astonishingly low. My son Jeffrey started waking up night after night screaming with night terrors. My wife and I found out that that was common among toddlers. I don't know. I don't know if it is or not. It was... it was so eerie. I just... I was starting to think that maybe my work was following me home. I felt bad for Sarge. His father got bit up real bad by some stray. Pit bull, I think. And let me tell ya, she knew. The day after that, she kept staring at him. He hadn't told any one of us. Nobody knew for about another week. But she knew. The whole time, she knew. It was late one night in the lab. And I happened to notice a paper clip on the floor inside the air lock portion of Judith's enclosure. Now, that environment was meticulously kept. It was nearly sterile. So there was no explaining how it got there. Anyway... I picked it up, I stuffed it in my pocket and didn't give it another thought. We were at my sister's house for my nephew's birthday. My wife and I never had kids, so Matthew was very dear to us. And I remember reaching for my keys and thinking I heard something fall onto the ground from my pocket. It was the paper clip. Burt, knock it off. - Claire, it's Matt! - What?! Matthew! Oh, my God! Matthew? Matthew? - Oh, my God! Sweetheart! - He's not breathing! He'd stuck it in a wall socket. I could've worn any other pants that day, but I wore those. And that paper clip just happened to be what he found? Out of all the things in the world, a balled-up receipt, a stick of bubble gum... that's what happened to fall out of my pocket at that moment? Not at any point in the five days before that? Not... not anywhere else? Not in... not in the hamper? In the washing machine? In the dryer? There? On his birthday? And the way the dog was barking, it was... it was... it was like... What happened... was no accident. That was it. I'd had enough. It was 10 years until I heard from Lawrence again. He and his wife moved out of the country shortly after it happened. I was surprised he didn't leave the institute sooner than he did. It was a shame what happened to his nephew. I don't think Lawrence ever really forgave himself. Well, we couldn't discount the events that happened outside the institute. Too much happened for it to be coincidence. But what it did do is make us rethink our strategy. What are we gonna use to immobilize her? Fentanyl. The gas derivative of it should knock her out in seconds. It could also kill her. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. - Hey. You can't keep her in there. - Now's not the time for compassion. - She's a human being. There are laws against that sort of treatment for a reason. Who do you think makes those laws? - This is my lab. - No, not anymore it's not. I have sat back and kept quiet... - while I've seen you... - And you'd do well to stay quiet. Get him outta here. I never should've called you people. Hold on. You really think you're equipped to handle this? Your little lab here with your flash cards and ESP machines? See it... but then it's gone. Now it comes back. You can... see that in the rest of the pictures. For those few moments... it wasn't in the room. Might not even been in the building. Do you understand what I'm telling you? We don't control this, it's not just us who will be at risk. And if you do control it, then who will be at risk? We recognized the danger of allowing it to remain even remotely unrestricted. It was immensely powerful. And rather than continually try to explain it, the decision was made to attempt to harness it. Repeat the following: one, two, three, four, five. Your instructions are clear. Repeat the following: one, two, three, four, five. You will cooperate. Now, this is a map divided into a grid consisting of five sections. One, two, three, four, five. I want you to listen carefully and concentrate. There are artillery and biological weapons being stored somewhere in this region. Look at the grid and tell me the number of where. Tell me where they're being stored. You will cooperate. Put it away. Part of me... will always feel responsible. Because it was my idea to notify the military. I don't know what we would've done otherwise. But... I do wonder if Henry might still be alive today if... I had settled on a more... reasonable solution. Sergeant. Do you hear me? Ms. Winstead, your instructions are to make Sergeant Parella say exactly the following: reposition all nuclear submarines out of the Baltic Sea. Once again, reposition all nuclear submarines out of the Baltic Sea. Your instructions are clear. - How many eyes does a fish have? - Turn up his volume. How many ears does a gopher have? How many noses does a monkey have? How many arms does a whale have? How many hoofs does a horse have? - How many noses does a monkey have? - Dr. West? - How many stripes does a zebra have? - Dr. West. How many eyes does a fish have? How many ears does an elephant have? How many stripes does a zebra have? How many eyes does a fish have? - How many eyes does a fish have? - Henry. - How many noses does a monkey have? - Dr. West. How many noses does a monkey have? How many noses does a monkey have? How many noses does a monkey have? How many noses does a monkey have? How many noses... You can't control something like that. I don't care who you are, how many weapons you have. All those things that went on... you don't get to play games with the Devil. And if you do, you damn sure don't get to make the rules. That type of evil... just thinking about it, talking about it. Even you people making this movie... and the people watching it... you're inviting bad things into your life. Too late for me. All the things I've seen. This wasn't like the books or the movies or false accounts you hear about. If those cases were legitimate, I can assure you, we would've intervened. This is real. There was no speculative data. There was no charlatans looking to make a buck. This was the only governmentally confirmed case of possession. Arguably the most significant thing we learned was that it had an intelligence. That meant that it was able to conduct some form of cost-benefit analysis. Our plan was to utilize its ability to reason as a stopgap measure to clear a psychological pathway. So they essentially offered it a choice between cooperating or suffering. But it was a false choice because both options caused Judith to suffer. Their belief was that if they could control her physical body, chiefly her mind, they could control how the force manifested. Possess the possession is what they would say. As if it was gonna work that way. Clear, go again. They pushed that poor woman to her limits. Judith Winstead, the person. I felt... terrible for her. But there was nothing we could do to help her. Please, stop. Please, stop. We were eventually able to devise a method of governing the force. Once we controlled her, we could effectively control it. Once that happened, the nature of our involvement changed dramatically. It was... shocking. But it wasn't at the same time. We knew something was coming. I mean, a few nights before that, I... found him curled up in a ball under the bathroom sink. Talking to himself. Crying. I mean, he was scared to death. Henry was nearing the end of his rope. After a while, he rarely even set foot in the lab. He would lock himself in the office for hours at a time. Sometimes you could hear him muttering from behind the door. Things were reaching a tipping point. I do. I do believe that it drove Dr. West to that. Trust me. We did a complete background check. We knew everything. We knew about the therapy, the medication. What happened was not a product of psychosis. Maybe you should take some time away from work. Henry? Maybe take some time off? It doesn't matter where I am. It's everywhere. It's like a shadow. Except it's not mine. So you feel like it's following you, the shadow. I feel like it's already caught me. To be totally honest, Henry, I find a lot of this very troubling. Is that why you're using that? - Yeah, we always record the sessions. - Not on a camera. Well, I... things seem different. - Did they make you do this? - Did who? - Is this to make sure I don't say anything? - I don't know what you're talking about. They're pushing it too far. They want to control everything, but they can't. It's too powerful. It's too strong. Take it easy, Henry. I'm trying to make you understand. There's something happening. - To you? - Yes. To me, then maybe to you, then maybe to them. Whoever it chooses. There's no science left in the world for this, but they think there is. It doesn't even matter anymore what I say. It's gonna speak for itself. So use your goddamn camera. Write my name. Write my words across the sky. I don't give a damn because if it... if they keep pushing it the way they are... Nod if you can hear me. Good. What I want you to do now is focus on the person on the television. Nod if you understand. I want you to tell me his name. Your instructions are clear. Tell me the name of the person you see on the television. Alan. Turcott. Next, I want you to tell me his current location. Hanscom. Office. Military office. Let's get them on the phone. - Tell them we're gonna try it out. - We're gonna try it out. They're ready. Listen very carefully to what I'm gonna tell you. What I want you to do now is attempt to influence Private Turcott's breathing. Begin. Your instructions are clear. - Tell her to stop it. - Stop it. - Tell her to stop! - Stop. I said stop! Hit her! We eventually figured out what was going on. And we felt so foolish for not having recognized that that was the government's intention from the beginning. To weaponize her. Having the ability to remotely collect intel. To be able to read the minds of foreign leaders to know exactly what their plan of attack is. Where they were and what they were thinking at any given moment. And, if necessary, be able to collapse their lungs and stop their hearts. All from thousands of miles away. We were looking at the future of clandestine warfare. Where attacks could be as strategic and as untraceable as we saw fit. The rigors of their testing protocol increased enormously. The more they pushed, the more defiant she became. Well, it became. We treated her like the discovery of any new destructive force. Much of what we did mirrored the testing procedures used in the early atomic testing. We needed to understand this power if we were intent on utilizing it. What are you? How do you choose your host? Now. Tell me your name. They were getting very frustrated because everything she said sounded like gibberish. They kept shocking her. When she didn't give them the answer they wanted, they'd shock her again. They'd up the voltage and shock her again. Our analysts were eventually able to isolate certain elements of Judith's speech. Turned out she hadn't been speaking gibberish at all. What are you? How do you choose your host? This will all be over soon. It just proved that she was in control the entire time. Just drawing us in. Drawing us in closer. And instead of stopping like we all knew we should, we kept going. We were too close to something truly revolutionary to stop. It was affecting everyone, but that's the nature of any struggle, any battle. Push and you will be resisted. That's why you want to be the one pushing the hardest. You would hear them discussing new ideas and strategies, disruption techniques, but nobody would talk about what was obvious. That there are certain things in this world that we will never understand. And Judith Winstead was one of them. It was acutely averse to all things related to religion. Even more than it was to electroshock. And that poor priest... he was just a pawn. We were very much against involving the Church. We didn't want to turn this into a sideshow. At the same time, we had to gain control somehow. This one, too. Thumbprint on that one as well. - Do you understand everything? - I do, yes. Into the camera, please. I understand. Okay. Do you have any questions? No. Good. That last night in the lab was... it was crazy. They told us to double up on our ammo just to stay safe. There was a big buildup. Everyone was mentally preparing for what might happen. We needed to get it out of the lab and we couldn't do that with a civilian. We had to transfer it into one of our own. When I arrived at the lab that night and found out what was going to happen... I froze. I wanted to scream for them not to try that. But I didn't say a word. I wanted to get out of there real bad. I remember, I wanted to sneak out the back door when nobody was looking and just go. And of course I couldn't. I should've. - Go ahead. - Copy that. Get ready, Corporal. Hey, hey, hey. Stop the transfer. The power of the blood of Jesus commands you! Bow to the Lord! Get him out of there. - Hit the gas. Hit the gas. - Help! Help! Pull him out! Pull him out. Make sure he's okay. Are you okay? - I'm gonna clear it. - No. No, no, no. Hold on. - Did it work? Did it work? - I... I don't know. Give her a quick charge. She's still out. No, no. The electrodes got disconnected. See? Shit. - Are you positive she's unconscious? - No. - Can we gas her again? - It might be too much. Well, I'm not going in there unless I know she's completely... - Then don't go in there. - If we don't get those electrodes... - Are you crazy? - We've got nothing if it's dead. - Hit her again! Now! - I'm not gonna hit her again. - Hit her again! - Don't... Robert, don't. Bilateral? Bi-frontal. What are you doing? What are you doing? You need to step back. I'm gonna check him. I'm gonna check his pulse. - That's it? - That's all. Let's start clearing again... Get him outta here. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. The situation was a disaster in all possible ways. Local law enforcement got involved, the media. They all wanted to know what happened, naturally. They had a right to the story. Just not to all of it. I'm still not at liberty to discuss much more than I have. Especially as it pertains to the events that took place after that night. But I can tell you this... the measures taken were done with the best interests of this country in mind. It wasn't until fairly recently that I found out what happened to my sister. And as horrible as it probably sounds, I preferred it that way. She was a good person. She was. But people change. Even good people. I know that the official story was that he was crazy. He was a mad scientist who had finally lost the last of his widely scattered marbles. But believe me when I tell you, Henry West was not crazy. Which I suppose... leaves us with the alternate explanation. What is this? Please, help.
