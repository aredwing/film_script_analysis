And that which we do unwittingly, remains, pursuing us... or worse, we end up pursuing it. Oh my God! Wiktor! What is it? What were you thinking about today... ...there? I was wondering if... at the moment of death... we feel our bodies as one enormous pain... and does awareness come off our skin like a bandage... off a wound? And...? And what is the relationship between our body and its torpor? I found this in Father Jerzy's desk. I'm giving it... to you. He wrote poetry? What is my life's measure? Arrant nothingness. From which my sad song will flow to your shores. And nothing shall after me remain... save that song, save the shimmering shadow on the wall... a passing dream... save a wooden coffin... awash in the gloom of dusk. So that's how he thought? Does it make itself felt? It reminds me sometimes. And I can't stop thinking about Jurek. I can't forgive myself... for not foreseeing that it might happen. But there was so much work, new greenhouses, lack of fertilizer... worries, arrangements, trips. So I finally left... and here, upon, my return... such tidings. It was that rotten Warsaw weather. He ran around, ill-dressed, until he caught a cold. Yes, it was pneumonia. An ordinary man, quiet, simple, God-fearing, hard-working... and my only friend. The world is a terrible place. Chiefly because of death. We cannot deny death. It's the only real value we possess. Wiktor... I want you to leave for three weeks and I'll inform Mother Superior. But there's so much work to do on the farm, and without me... Please go, you can be replaced. Don't you have family and friends in the country? You really must go. THE YOUNG LADIES OF WILKO Based on a story by Jaroslaw lwaszkiewicz Screenplay by Starring Set design Director of photography Directed by Are you here to see Mr. Kawecki? Fela? Lt's me. Wiktor! Kazia, it's Wiktor! Good evening. My God, Wiktor! I was on my way to my uncle's place and thought I'd... - We asked them about you. - They knew nothing. All these years without any news or a single letter, shame on you! Julia... You are a legend here at Wilko. I was just saying yesterday, if Wiktor were only here... I really am surprised... I never would've thought... I was silent, certain in the belief that no one here remembered me. It's not true. We come here for... the summer holidays. Don't you recognize me? Kazia! We're all here now quite by chance. I don't see Fela. Fela! This is my oldest, and my other one, such a big girl. They're both big. I didn't know you were married. But I meant adult Fela. Mum... Where's our grown-up Fela. Don't you know? She died. Sit down. I'll show you her grave. Will you stay for dinner? No thanks, I'm in a hurry. But I'd like some horses. You'll have some tea. - Yes, ma'am? - Hitch the horses. I've heard nothing about you for fifteen years. Don't count them! I have no idea of what's been going on... who's married and who's not. I don't want to commit any gaffes. Off to bed, children. I'm married with two children. Kazia's divorced, one son. Jola's married, but no children. Tunia's unmarried... and Zosia's married and has a son. What about you? What's there to say? I fought in the Polish-Soviet War. I was at the battle of Kiev. I'm a retired captain. I work, managing a farm near Warsaw. I live a normal life. I don't do anything important. The horses are ready. You'll eat dinner with us tomorrow... I must eat dinner there, but I'll come for tea. For sure. Wiktor! You remembered about us! Time goes by so quickly... Your uncle's already asleep. - You have electricity! - Yes, last year. This is Kasia. Prepare the guest room. - She'd looks like Walercia. - Yes, she does. Want something to eat? Maybe some of this. I'm sure you stopped by Wilko. Yes, they remember me well. Are you surprised? You were too young then to appreciate their glances. Are you still alone? Yes. And you're satisfied? I like my work, I'm useful. Work! You lost the finest young ladies! Auntie! Oh, all right, we won't talk about it. Go to sleep. Good-night. Put some more wood on the stove. She moves like a snail! Good morning. Tunia! I haven't seen you for so long! These are for you from Kazia, her specialty. Currants, strawberries... My how you've grown! Wiktor's not here? He's sleeping. Shall I wake him? No, don't bother. Good-bye. Thank Kazia for the jam. Wiktor... Wiktor... Wake up, dinner's on the table. You must be exhausted. You slept all morning. Get up now... we're waiting for you. You haven't mentioned the war... about Kiev. What was it like? It was ghastly... Stop it! Let him eat in peace. Forgive me auntie, but I'm going to Wilko for tea. We won't have time to enjoy you. Oh well, young people... Not so young anymore. You've gotten younger. And even more beautiful. The young ladies of Wilko will regret they didn't wait for you. But these days divorce is in vogue, so all is not lost. Hello. Hello. Come in. Dinners are later here. We've just eaten. My husband... Wiktor Ruben... Our neighbors' nephew. We used to spend summers together. Once he even tutored Zosia. Please sit down. No, no... Pleased to meet you. My uncle praises you... as a professional who's developed Wilko. It was nothing... I also manage a farm. Cigar? - Milk or butter? - This and that... lt's hot today. How do you like it? It's excellent. Julia, where's Jola? She has guests today. Edward brought them. She'll be busy. If you wish to take a walk later... then maybe with Zosia. I'll go find her. - Zosia! - I'm in here. May I? Don't mind him. He sleeps after dinner, like every real man. You mean you don't? Your vigil? Let's go walk in the garden... or in the barn-yard. I'm too lazy. Maybe Tunia will go with you, she still wants to. Fine... It was 1922 or 1923... The schoolmaster came to Grudziaz... May I introduce you gentlemen... Wiktor Ruben... a childhood friend. Sit down, gentlemen. And you? Would you like to go for a walk? What's this? You read philosophy! - Do you like going for walks? - And you, sir? - Call me by name. - You're too old, sir! - I suppose that was silly. - Not at all. As a child, you always had such frightened eyes. You once ran into the salon and cried, "a chicken's chasing me!" I would always take walks with Fela then. Do you remember her? You look like her. A little. She died 15 years ago. No, not there. How's that? Not in the family tomb? Supposedly there was no room. She's buried down lower. I imagine she feels good here. This is Fela's grave. Mum rarely comes here? She doesn't go out much. She's not well. You sigh as if you were in love. It's time for tea. Go back yourself, I'm not coming. When will you visit us again? When Jola's guests leave. That won't be soon. Others will follow these. Go now. Please. Who is it? Tunia. What do you want? Zosia... I'd like... I want to ask you something. Do you like him? Who? Wiktor. No. No? No. And you? Me? No. Really? Yes. That's good. What are you doing? Can't sleep? I used to sleep like a log when I was your age. Why aren't you asleep? It's no secret. I sit here... and reminisce. Reminisce? Do you reminisce only about the good moments? Yes, I remember people. I see them... as they were when... they gave me friendship and love... and I felt happy. Were there many such moments... of happiness? Yes. I know that now. When I was young... I didn't. So only my life is stupid and meaningless. All aimless wandering. But in my opinion... to talk of happiness is naive. I've thought about it a lot and... it's utopia. Listen... One day you'll conclude that your life was like any other... with moments both good and bad. Good night, I hope you get some sleep. All is not well at Wilko. Kawecki manages the farm well... but he's not kind to Julia's sisters. It's all about money. He took over the estate... and was to pay off the sisters, but he hasn't even begun yet. Kazia mortgaged her mother's part... but Kawecki treats Kazia very badly indeed... because she's not married and has to live there with her mother. I don't care at all about any of this. Good morning. I've come to invite you to mum's birthday party. - Thank you, we'll be there. - Wiktor too? You can't stay home alone. It's been a long time since I was last here. Jola... who are those men? They spoiled the pleasure of your company for me. They've left. There are to be others. Tunia told me. They come, they go... Are you jealous? Jealous? Well look at this... Such a strange conversation, you explaining yourself... Really? Then I needn't ask... because it's not important to me. It isn't and never was. A pity. - Were you in love with me? - And you with me? I suppose not. Exactly and I hope... you now know I've never loved you. You played a different role in my life. What was that? No matter what I did, I always asked myself... "What would Wiktor say?" The funny thing is... how long it has lasted. I look for your praise... your evaluation, reaction. And... And what? You wouldn't have always been pleased with me. Have you been? I came to tell you that I know it's not good. But I ask you... not to condemn me. Jola... what right would I have to condemn you... or anyone else? You know who I am. A noble person. That's saying a lot, and too little; you know my life. Is there anything in it which gives me the right to judge others? No, nothing. It's smooth and empty. You have your work. For lack of other. You've dedicated yourself to the blind. I didn't love you... but I respected you and still do, very much. That's too little for me. They'll be here soon for me. Let's go for a walk. Not in the garden, but in the barn-yard. There are so many interesting things here. All right, let's go. Moral authority... is used as a support by those who live immoral lives. But what does "immoral" mean? Look! How lovely! Black and white patches. Look! In my opinion, immoral means aimless. Something which is done senselessly, needlessly. That's what I call lacking morality. Rushing about like animals before the flood! - You look beautiful. - What? I'm going to have a pigsty at my place too. That's my plan. Unfortunately, Jola has to serve supper instead of Kazia. Did you invite them to mum's birthday party? Yes. Jola's strange. Her husband rarely visits Wilko. But there are always other men there... friends of hers, supposedly. I'm not 2O years old any more. You think I haven't seen women? What harm can she do me? I'd like to... have you marry Tunia, but Jola's spoiling it for me. What are you standing there for? Keep churning! Today we feel joy in our hearts... and the reason we will gladly say. We bring you wishes on this, your birthday. May you be healthy and live a long time. May roses round your head, a wreath intertwine. May the sun in the sky that always shines bright. Send its warm rays to you, so you always feel right. Wish you Kicia, Fela, and Antos. How was your trip? Fine, thank you. How do you find living here? Quite normal. I go for walks, read... take naps after dinner. Here, a person is inclined to self-reflection. Yes. Especially after 15 years. I used to come here before the war. So it was you... that Fela fell in love with? I imagined you completely differently. Thanks to Jola's stories, I'm sure. But don't you believe her. Nor you. You have a charming wife. Yes! And a very demanding one. What's wrong? I'm bored stiff. Someone will hear you! Fine, after dinner. Do you think I'm wealthy? You sit here... for months and have the nerve to invite guests! Who are those people? - I didn't invite them. - No, of course not, not you! But you announced a dinner, tea, supper... Enough acting on your own! Please ask me first! Is that clear? Come help me. I thought you'd leave and not even speak to me. What shall I do? Have some of these... and entertain me at this boring job. A wonderful proposition. I can't stand those people yet I don't know why. Because they are vacuous. And you judge them too quickly. They aren't philosophers. They're simple and hard-working. Especially my sisters. No, the others. I only view them differently. I'm not anyone special. It was my passages, I suppose... which distinguished me... from the rest of the world. What do you mean, passages? A difficult, poor childhood. Then time wasted at university... which was interrupted by the war. It was the war which really pulled the rug out... from under my feet. No, you were always different... separate from others... from the very beginning. You flatter me. No, it's neither a virtue or a credit. I have no virtues or credits either... yet I am different and that's most important in my life. This difference doesn't depend on us. Wolves are loners... and sheep stay in flocks. Please get out! Only here at Wilko... the wolves are eaten by the sheep. Rozia, take the tray, quickly! We saw you differently too, when we were all mad about you. What are you talking about? Who was mad? We all were, especially Fela. Only now do we know how much. I don't think Jola was. She only pretended. She's always imitated me, perhaps that's why. And I was mad about you. You were in love with me? Yes, very much. Now you're not? No, don't worry. I forgot all about you. Your appearance surprised me. You're completely different. I've gotten older. Certainly, but not only that. You've faded somehow. But I prefer not seeing you the way you used to be. It would destroy my life, put together with difficulty. I assure you, you have nothing to fear from me. I can't imagine now how one could love like that. I think it's even funny. For great love means humiliation and absurdity. Humiliation yes, but absurdity? Haven't you ever felt the absurdity of such blind attachment? No, never. Then you've never loved. You're right! Because I never had time for it. - Why so much? - So there's enough for the chosen. Kazia, it wasn't that I didn't have time. I was a coward. It's good you know that. Yes, I do. The tea's ready, we may serve. Thank you... Another stage reached. Likely the last. Did we get far? Very far indeed. What do you want? I asked you to come because I wanted to see you. I came because it was my mother-in-law's birthday. I'm returning to Warsaw today. Go back then. Stop it! Help me. Help. Which means? Do something so that I'd... Why, don't you have enough? No. You wanted this separation. I wanted... I was afraid to grow old happily with you. I won't help you. Because I don't want to. It cost me far too much to stop loving you. I can't. Kazia... What's wrong? Stop crying! You know how my husband is. Having a good time? Ever been duck hunting? No. Then we'll go together. All right. Wiktor... Are you asleep? Your aunt told me to wake you. You're going hunting with Tunia. - I don't want to. - She'll be here soon! Have her go home. It's bad weather for ducks. I'm not leaving until you get up. It's too late to go duck hunting! I'm sorry... Let's go. Finally, you woke up! What sort of books do you read? All sorts. Now I'm reading Descartes. Why are you laughing? It isn't funny at all. Because when I was your age, I used to lie on the grass... and read books which I didn't understand. I didn't understand Hegel, I studied Kant. Youth, unknown choices, a waste of time. So much time wasted. Later there was neither time nor inclination to return to it. Why do you constantly talk of the past? Because it's like this... like this late wild strawberry. I take it to my lips... and sniff... and I'm reminded of June, yet it is no longer June. It is only an illusion that nothing has changed. Yet every month, week and day has its own color... and as they pass, they change a person, his thoughts and feelings. The scent of this strawberry reminds me... that everything was once different, the trees, my own laughter. Perhaps, but it's summer now... and autumn is a long way off. You really think that? Have you ever seen paintings by Giorgione? Yes, why? You remind me of an angel in one of them. Exactly like Fela. I'm Tunia. Yes, Tunia. Edward and Jola's husband have gone so I can have a dance. Come, it'll be my evening. That's enough. Here he comes! - How was the hunting? - Marvelous. Where are the ducks? Ducks? There haven't been any ducks there for ages. Wiktor... I like being with you. Let's get married. Tunia... what are you saying? Please let me. Let's join them. Why aren't you dancing? Dance with Tunia. With Miss Tunia? Must he always do what I tell him? How horrible! You know, Zosia, there are moments when I'm not afraid of anything. Not even myself. Look, Tunia is all grown up. - May I have this dance? - No. Perhaps Zosia won't turn me down. May I have this dance? No. Excuse me. Kazia! Where shall I put this, ma'am? You look fabulous. It's Julia's old dress, from her engagement party. You won't say no, will you? Where is Julia? These dances aren't for her. Julia... why aren't you with us? You know... ...l've never forgotten. All these years! In terrible moments, in battles, in the trenches... I would dream that once again I mixed up the rooms. Remember how I mixed up the rooms then, after my walk? I only realized it as I was lying right here... and felt your body. You pretended to be asleep and I did too. That game continued... until our bodies started to search for each other... searching, searching, remember? I felt... I felt your body and it was... Never again... would I ever experience... such a sensation. I don't know why I'm telling you this, and I'm not ashamed at all. I've been waiting all evening for you to come and tell me... exactly that. Shall we go dance? Yes, let's. Now ask me to dance. The party's over for me. What are you standing there for? Go take Tunia a shawl! Get away from me! I don't ever want to see you again. I wanted to kiss you first! Which of us are you visiting today? Zosia... Since you arrived, we've talked only about you. I've come to apologize to Tunia. Apologize? I hurt her? And Fela too, once? I don't understand. As usual. I think you'll become the hero of the house once again. Which means? What are you trying to tell me? Nothing. Do you get by without women? Yes. Extraordinary! But we have our doubts. If you don't rouse hope, then at least passion. That terrified, uncertain expression of yours. Just like back then. Go and play now. You are afraid, just like you used to be, of making a decision... of yourself... Did you just discover my virtues, or did you know them then? I've been observing you ever since I was a child. It was like blind man's bluff, you with your eyes covered... and movement all around you. I played while watching Fela. I knew more than you did, even though I was only a child. A woman of twelve. A woman child sees more than a young man. Maybe that's why I didn't like you or take you seriously. You're saying painful things. Because you don't really care. You don't care about any of this. That's why you don't need to apologize to Tunia. You know... you've changed me with those few words. Maybe I awakened something which had been dormant in you. Just the opposite. Summer has ended inside of me. What's that? Nothing. Tell me. I was drawing my life line. It rises beautifully till 1914. After that, it gets worse. We haven't ridden in a long time. What are you waiting for? I wanted to tell you something. I was coming home from hunting one day just before the war... when I came upon this meadow. I suddenly saw... you sitting and Fela standing naked with her back towards me... brushing her hair. You were wearing a blue, dotted dress and when you saw me... you screamed and Fela turned... and asked, "Why don't you pass?"... or, "Why don't you come?" Do you remember what she said? She shouted, curled up squatting, trying to cover herself. What was it she said? Don't you remember? No? Stop it! Come on. How could we forget about mama? She likes to eat. Zosia's husband is here. It's not surprising. A diplomat. The Consul in L beck. Was L beck in the Hanseatic League? Yes, it was, in the middle ages. Wasn't it? Give him more fodder, his flanks are caving in. They're beautiful. What would I do without them?! I've come to say farewell. So, you're leaving? What's wrong, uncle? You're exhausted. You must look after your health. Take care of yourself. I'm all right, it'll pass. I think I know why you don't sleep at night. And yours is a different reason than mine. You see... I don't want to be surprised. I want to consciously accept it. I'm curious to know how thought strips away from the body... and whether it hurts or not. You see... that is my... resignation... my reassurance. What are you doing with him?! I'm going to pack. Hold on to him firmly! Hello. Wiktor... maybe you'd like to help me? No, I want to watch. Hello. Hello. Excuse me. What is it? In your opinion, sensitivity dulls with age... and what happened yesterday was... only in bad taste, is that it? And that it spoiled what you had once experienced here? Let's drop it. Are you just going to stand there? Sit down. My word, I am so hungry! I know full well... I know what you're thinking. But I really don't care. I don't care. Finally! Not long ago, you said something else. Yesterday's consummation of our... relationship, our feelings, should've remained... unrealized. Is that what you call it? I never would've thought of that. It was on such a different plane than our youthful flirting... that the two can't be compared. That's true. But that flirting gave rise to needs... Oh really? Stop it, please. Friendship between us is impossible. We move in such different spheres. Not in a social sense. I mean astronomical spheres. Astronomical. You mean... we can't share a mutual orbit, is that it? There'd have to be a cosmic catastrophe. Awful... You are awful. Jola... there's a letter from your husband. Glutton! This is your second breakfast! "Dear Jola, I'm pleased to inform you that I arrived safely... Then next day I made my way to my law offices... Please convey my thanks to Jola... Jola? Julia! I thanked myself! I'm sorry... for any problems... I sincerely hope... And so on. Nice letter? It's a form letter! "It's my pleasure to inform you!" He's become completely stupid in that law office of his! Give me that cucumber... You always take what I prepare for myself! You know, in all honesty, I always loved Julia. - Want some cheese? - No, honey. The linens are pressed. My dear, I'd like to leave now. - You still have four days. - I could even extend it. Well, if you really want to leave... there's no point in staying. Wiktor's leaving. Really? You've made up your mind? Yes, I'd like to say good-bye. So long. Will we see you in another fifteen years? Say good-bye to your mother for me. Because our friendship has reached a new stage. Thank you. Where's Tunia? She's barely left her room since the night of the party. She hardly comes down for meals. What's she doing? I don't know, reading perhaps. Are you taking the afternoon train? That's right. I'll go say good-bye to Tunia. Tunia, I wanted to say good-bye. I wanted to bid you farewell. Good-bye. Julia, what's wrong? It's not time for your shot yet! I don't know. Lately I've been feeling better... I'll be fine. Kazia, did Tunia come to breakfast? No. Tunia! Oh my God. It's locked! Take this away! Everything's going to be all right now. Do you plan to live like this forever? What do you mean? I'm talking about your future. So, you think I should quit my work? Work which suits me? Or perhaps I should remain here, or at Wilko? The war years cost me so much... I put so much effort into those that followed... that I want no more changes in my life. That's no argument; you continue to waste them. Haven't you ever longed for love? Yes, I have. I know. I know. It slipped through my fingers. But not now. Long ago. You look a lot better than you did when you arrived. Tanned, strong... Thanks to you. You really don't want a ride? No, thanks. - When will you be back? - Don't ask him that. Well, Wiktor, I think this is the last time we'll see each other. What are you saying?! He knows. Farewell. Farewell, uncle. Go now, go on. Good-bye. What are your feelings leaving Wilko? I don't know, regret, I suppose. For all that passes, slips away... all that you can only see from a distance. I'm going to miss my train! One more day and I'd have stayed. - You're joking? - Of course. What would I do here, a lost soul from another planet? Please don't neglect Fela's grave.
