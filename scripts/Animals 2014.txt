You want me to slide it across the floor. - Yes. - Across this dirty, germ-infested... - Yes. - All right, hold on. Women, right? I'll help clean you. See, there's more nerves in the bottom of the human foot than any other part of the body. It stimulates the Babinski Effect. - Babinski? - Babinski. I still say boobs are much sensitiver. But Gary didn't have boobs. So what I would do is I would tie him up, and then I would nail a bunch of pins to the bottom of his feet, like a hundred of them, and he'd never walk again. - What's wrong? - It's no use. I'm sorry. I just... I did too much shit. - I could... - No. - I could... - I know, I know. I'm sorry. Wax on, wax off. Ooh-chop. I love his little karate outfit. Oh, my God, amazing. Two windows over.

Well, I'm a sexy, horny college girl looking to blow off a little steam, if you know what I mean. So call Roxy at mailbox 721. Done. - How was that? - It was good. Let me do it again. No, it's good. I want some of that. Roxy? Really? Yeah. I went to high school with a girl named Roxy. She had a lisp. We're too early. What are we gonna do for an hour? How do I look? Like a guy who works at a funeral home. Like the handsomest guy who works in a funeral home. Just act like we belong. We do. Do you think a prayer gets more attention if it's wrapped in a $10 bill? Nah. A 20 maybe. I could price, you know, 4,000 CDs in a year, and wouldn't even come close. No, shit! I've always wanted one of these. Oh, how perfect would this be for our road trip? Let's keep it. Are you sure? Yeah. How close are we? We are... here. Aw, yeah. Look at that landscaping. I need a hit for this. Do you have anything? - I'm out. - No. I gotta like a rinse. That's it. Shit. Don't forget to honk this time. Take this. - For what? - For protection. What am I gonna do? Put up shelves? So... welcome. Make yourself comfortable. - Wow. - Yeah, I was just watching the game. ...have already surpassed their sack total from all of last season. Turn it off. They have nine sacks, have six... I'm, uh... My name is... Oh, it doesn't matter. I'm gonna call you Guy. If that's okay with you, Guy. Sure. Yeah. Sit, Guy, you're making me nervous. Oh... I'm sorry. So what do you do? Uh, I'm in, uh... I work at the Board of Trade. You must be good at your job. Oh, you know. I do all right. I had some good things happen in grains. I work in grains. Cool. Not at all. But, you know, it's a job, though. So you're gonna behave yourself, right? Hmm? We can do our business without Frank having to come in here and watch us the whole time. Oh, y-yeah. Yeah. Of course. Good. I hate it when he watches. I have some cocaine. Yeah-oh. Do you, um... Do you party? This is... well. It's supposed to be pretty good stuff. So, well, you know, it's an option. Oh, shit, um... I almost forgot. You talked to Frank on the phone, right? You know the rules? Oh, yeah, yes. He hates it when I tell people this, but a couple of months ago, I was with this guy, and he didn't want to pay, and so then when Frank came in to make him pay, he called the cops, said he was being robbed. Can you believe that? So now Frank just makes me bring out the first half and then, you know, the second half when we're done. So what happened with the... With the guy? We went back a few days later, and Frank set his house on fire. Um... here. You know what? I'm gonna just give you a bit more for just, you know, because, and then... And then I'll give you more, um, you know... Be right back. They out of town for the weekend? No, they're... I get my kids every other weekend. My ex is, um... She's... They live in Skokie. Um, make another drink, and I'll be right back. Go. Fucking go! Oh, man, I swear to God, babe. This is the last time that we're going to do this. I get so nervous when you're in there. Just a rinse, right? Mm-hmm. You just had a rinse left, right? Yeah. Our lives still mean something Where the desert and the mountains meet Where the desert and the mountains meet I wish I's in the sunshine Drinking tequila, beer, and wine Where the cactus flower bloom We'll set up camp beneath the moon We'll set up camp just me and you And I will sing you cowboy songs Like Ramblin' Jack and Townes Van Zandt I will sing you cowboy songs, babe I will sing you songs like that I will sing you songs like this Sheriff 'long the county line I'm a fugitive running from the la-a-w Mess with me or a friend of mine And you're never gonna find a faster dra-a-w I'm the quickest Said I'm the quickest I'm the quickest Man you ever saw Oop. My scalp's still burning. That just means it's working. Ooh. Do you think he's gonna like what we did with the place? Ah! Ah! Man, I got three times as much as that. I don't know. I got it. Oh, man, I got it. Everyone and everything, there's this one big... thing. You know what I mean? We couldn't handle it, right? Um, because we... Us was just like a me, and it was fucking lonely. We trick ourselves into thinking that we're just surrounded by each other, and this, like, infinite amount of other people and babies and dogs and fire trucks, but th... Th-th-th-there's... There's not. It's... it's... it's just us. It's just... it's me. You and me. Maybe it's just us. You got coke? It's supposed to be blue or pink... But it's yellow. I don't know what that means. You don't even like coke. I like coke. Adrianne Balboa. Mm-hmm. - And? - Rocky. Balboa. Relationship to patient? Spouse. Social? 721... 520... That's too many numbers. So you're definitely not pregnant. I hope that's good news. Yes. I'm still a little concerned about this pain, so I'm gonna order some more tests, if you don't mind hanging out a bit longer. Someone will be down here to take you to radiology. Let us know if you need anything. - Thank you. - Thanks. You got it. Yes. Hey. I thought you got caught. Sorry. How'd it go? Savvy. You? Fruitful. Oh, good. Let's go. What'd he say? Uh, fine. What is it? Let's just go, okay? Fuck did he say, Bob? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. Hey. Whoa. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Come here. Come here. Let me see. Come here. What is it? I eat your tears and I save them right up in my belly. I'm Popeye. Your tears are my spinach. They make me strong. That's not fair. I'm the one who might have cancer. I need spinach. Anything ever happen to you, I'd... stop working. Nothing before you, Bob, and there's nothing after you. We could call, um, Steve. He's your brother. Gary is a doctor. Are you joking? Even if he would help me, which he wouldn't, I would never ask them for anything. Sorry. Hey! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come here, please? Come here. I'm sorry. Come here. Listen, I'm gonna get you a really good doctor. I'm not taking you to county or any shitty hospitals in the city, okay? And we'll pull Gary's hair plugs out with a power drill. Fine. You've never been swimming? I ain't swimming in that. Why not? Sharks. There's no sharks in Lake Michigan. That's what they want you to think. You know we couldn't have been born into more ideal circumstances. We're white. We're American. You're a male. Advantage. College degree, middle class... That's a double advantage. So what happened, sugar toes? I don't know, babe. Why does the bird keep flying in the same window? Oh fuck. Hold on! There's somebody in here! Jesus. Ooh. Anything? Not even an M&M. Jesus, Jude. You haven't pooped in over a week. That's not healthy. A few more hours, I'm gonna have the opposite problem. So... I wanna do one more date. No. One more. One more, and then we'll buy a bunch of methadone off Megan, and we'll drive. We'll figure it out. I like that idea. I like it a lot. We get out of Dodge, get enough methadone to taper off and go on a road trip. We should go someplace there's really good free clinics, like Portland, get to a really good doctor. Yeah. Yeah? So one more date. I got an idea. Excuse me. Hi, has anyone turned in a laptop from underneath that bench over there in like the last 20 minutes? - A laptop? - Yeah, it's a silver... God! I'm so stupid. I'm gonna lose my job. I've been here the last few hours. - Nobody's turned anything in. - There's a project on it... And if I don't turn it by 3:00, my boss is... - I'm gonna lose my job. - Where do you work? At Burnham. I... I work at Burnham. If anyone turns it in, I'll bring it over. - What floor? - No, no, you can't do that. There's some... There's some confidential client information on it, and if they find out that I misplaced it, I'm gonna be in deep shit. Okay. Thanks. Look, I'm sorry. Do you think maybe that you could ask around to other security guards and find out if anyone's turned it in in the area? I'll give you my number, and just call me if you hear anything. I have $2,000 that I can give as a reward. 2,000? It's the last of my graduation money. I just... I cannot lose this job. Please? Thank you. Baby! Stop it. My little man. Stop it. I could've been a doctor. You could've been a doctor. I could've been a sailor. It says average entry level salary for a four-year college grad is $44,660. I wonder how much we'd make in a single day if that was us. Mm, 260 working days in a year, give or take Arbor Day or whatever... gross take home's 171 and change. So between us, we could bring in 343 bucks. And 50 cents. Or something. Did you seriously just do that? Excuse me? Sir? Can I help you find something? Um, you guys have a lost and found office here? Did you lose something? Actually, I found something. That's great. A young woman lost that just today. She's gonna be really happy. Oh, that's great. Um, I'd love to give it to her myself. I can do it. Don't worry about it. No, I'd love to do it. I mean, maybe she'll want to buy me a drink, You know? Maybe there's a reward in it. You know, I think there may be a reward for that. How much? I'll tell you what. I'll split it with you. She said she'd give 500 bucks to whoever found it. God, she must really want this thing. Um... I tell you what, Norman, I'm gonna keep 400 since I'm the one that found it. Come on. You know what, um... thank you. I bet I can find her around here somewhere. - Thank you. - No... All right. 350? 400, man. You're getting $100 to hand over a laptop. You're right. There's nothing left, babe. Do you think we could get another laptop? It's Saturday. Downtown's gonna be dead. How much is left? Five bucks. I'm really starting to feel fucking sick. Shit. Shit. How much? - How much? - 50. Don't you ask me about the damn $2! You take my money! Keep your hands off me. Keep your voice down. You see people come through the hallway. They call the police. You shut up. I ain't trying to hear that. You can't hear that with your deaf ass. - What up? - Hey, what's up? Buttercup's not working? The fuck you know about Buttercup? I'm a regular. Um, you guys open? A regular. Look man, I've been coming to Buttercup for a while. You guys serving? Buttercup got bumped. Shit. A motherfucker snitched on him. I don't know anything about that, man. Are you... He knows me. Um, look, I got money. Jesus. This place is crawling with cops. We gotta scoot. This one is higher. You have to take into account the height of it... I see that. This one's longer, look. Are you... Are you joking? Look at that! There's nothing in this... Fine, then I'm picking this one. Fine. Fine, fine, fine. Fine, fine. Hold it. Just... Can you hold on a second? Hold on, hold on, hold on. Can you... That's my stuff. Yep. El bao, por favor? Okay. Okay. Oh, fuck. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Fuck! Come on. - No, no, no, no. - No. Fuck! Why would you give him all of our money if you don't know who he is, you don't him, - you don't if his stuff is good? - It's not my fault. Fuck. What are you doing? I'm gonna see if we have any messages. No, I can't do a date when I'm this sick, Jude. It was your fucking idea. Oh, God, you are so protective of me, right? "No more dates, babe. No more dates." But now that I'm fucking sick, you don't give a shit. Babe. Get you something to drink? I'm fine. Beer? Cocktail? No, thanks. Water? Sure. Oh... So you... talked to Frank. You, um, know the rules? Yes. So Frank can come in here and sit with us or if you think that you can behave yourself, he'll... he'll... I'll just bring him out the money, - and he'll wait outside. - Sure. He just likes me to come in first so that I can... check things out and make s-sure that I feel safe. So. Can I cum on your face? Your mouth? Can I cum in your mouth? Well, whatever you want. Do you like cum on your face? Um, Frank's gonna be really pissed if I don't come out soon. - That's Frank. - Yeah. Oh, f... hey! - Fuck. - Go! - What the fuck? - Go! What the fuck happened? God d... What the fuck... screwdriver! Where's the screwdriver?! Damn it! Get the fuck back! I swear to fucking God! I'll poke your fucking eyeballs! Fuck! God damn it. Fuck! Fuck! Are you okay? Are you okay? Bob? Bob, what the fuck... God damn it. C'mon, man. Fuck. I swear to God, we're not... We're not gonna do this. That's it. Go right in and go back to Hol... Holbart? - Gonna go to Hallman. - Hallman. Right. And if not Hallman, then we'll try that spot on, um, Shakespeare, that one from a few months ago. Remember that, um... That guy? He had the, um... Like half of his nose was closed? His stuff was good, right? There's fucking cops all over this place, man. Look, look over there. That... that guy's working. I don't see anybody. Over there. Look. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Go over there. Okay. - Yep. - Oh, yeah, okay. Hey, man. You working? Sweet. Got a little cocoa. Were they open? Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to get out of the car. Now. The fuck, are you living in this car? Swear to God, officer. The spot was closed. We didn't get anything. You just let us go, we're not gonna come back to... Shut up. We don't have anything, okay? Just please let us go home. And we won't come back here. I promise. Take off your shoes. Officer, I swear. The spot was closed, we... Take off your fucking shoes. Let's go. Jesus Christ. Stupid fuck. The spot looks open to me. Now you. She doesn't have anything to do with this, she was waiting... If I have to tell you again to keep your fucking mouth shut. Now I can get a female officer over here in two minutes to give you a full search, or you can just shake out your shirt and take off your shoes. I was just waiting in the car. I don't have anything, okay? I'm totally... we're out. We're out, man. I got rig... I've got rigs in the car and that's it. That's it. Please, we're clean. You know what these are? Huh? These are my beat-down gloves. Now... face or body? I said face or body? I'd go for the body, kid. I don't even know... Fuck... body! No, no, no, no! Fine, fine, fine! Please, stop! Here, here! Oh, fuck! That's it. That's what I got. See, you still got a shoe on there. Take off your shoe. Stop fucking with me. Take off your fucking shoe. - It's fucking nothing. - We can be here all night. - Okay, okay. - Fuck. Rigs. You see that house down there next to the street light? Two weeks ago we had to go down there and help carry our friend out of that fucking pile of shit... in a body bag. He got shot on the back of the head with a MAC-10. Every time you shop here, you're helping these fucking hood rats buy a MAC-10. He didn't deserve to die. You deserve to die. You fucking piece of shit. Ought to fucking kill you right now, you fucking piece of shit. Let 'em go. - Let's go. - Get out of here. I'm sorry. You okay? Sit down. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I can't do this, Jude. I need a second to think. This hurts so bad. Let me just get us into the park. I'll figure something out, okay? What? What are you gonna figure out? What is your big plan, Jude? What the fuck do you want me to do? I can't keep getting sick like this. I just can't. We gotta call your brother. Why don't you call your mom? I can't. You know I can't do that. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. You call her, you tell her that you're sick, and she will get you a doctor. She'll wire you money. I can't. Why?! I don't understand it, Bob. - Is it because of Gary?! Is that it? - Shut up! - Is that the big reason? Well, boo-hoo! - Shut up! Your stepdad's an asshole. - Everyone has an asshole in their family! - Oh, God, Shut up! Oh, shit! Oh, baby. What? The guy at the new spot wanted to give me two extra for being a new customer. I saw them fall out of your shoe. There was only six of them. I had a feeling. Oh, thank God. I fucking love you. Let's not get too carried away. They were up my ass. Ow. Oh, no. Watch your head. Watch your head. Ow! - Come here. - Look at our car. What happened to our car? Oh, no. Babe, do you ever think we'll go swimming? Of course. You've been saying that a long time. Two years. Whoa. Two years. Two years. When I was a kid, I used to love gymnastics. I could, um... I could do a back walkover, and I could do front handsprings. Oh... ooh! Oh, God, be careful! Oh, this carpet. Gonna get a staph infection. Oh, man. At least they got a pool. We could go skinny-dipping. Oh, can we? Oh, hold on. I got it. I got it. I got it. It's okay. Oh, jeez, what the fuck is that? Hold on. Hold on. Get it, get it, get it, get it. Hi-yah! Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. I've never seen anything like you before. You're so pretty. - You're like the most beautiful girl that I've... - Shh. - You are the most beautiful... - Shh. Do you have a clean one? Uh... I think you... have done enough for one evening, young lady. Do you? I do. There's something you gotta figure out about me. Hmm? When I want to do something... I do it. Like when I saw you at the show... I thought... I want him all to myself. Here we are. Why? I just knew. Do you throw up? Only if it's good. I hate throwing up. I don't think we should do this right now. I think... Got you. I got you. Skinny-dipping. Skinny-dipping. Skinny-dipping. Skinny-dipping. Fuck, yes, skinny-dipping. To the pool. Mm, mh-mh, come on. Swimming, let's go swim. Let's go swimming. What if we, um... What if we just... Shit. It hurts so bad. I know. I don't even think I can walk right now. How much do you think she has in her purse? That fence... is blocking her. That stuff is blocking her. - I don't think anyone can see her. - I don't think so either. She'll scream. What are you doing? I heard about this. I'll tell her that I have AIDS and then if she makes any noises, I'll stick her. Tell her you'll stick her baby. She'll give you anything. Do you have the car ready? Yeah. Okay. I couldn't do it. I'm sorry, I couldn't do it. I didn't want you to do it. I'm sorry, Bob. - No. - I'm s... I'm sorry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Fuck, baby. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, help! Help me! Help please, somebody call 911! Call 911! I don't know what's wrong with him! The doctor doesn't want anyone to disturb him right now. I have a right to see him. Actually, you don't. A legal spouse or a family member could... I am... his family. We have to make a decision that's best for Jude right now. At the moment, we feel he's gonna need to stay under observation. He has a tooth infection, right? That's what you said. You said that he has an infection from an abscess. We have to do a complete evaluation based on the state that Jude was in when he arrived in our care. Because he doesn't have any insurance, we've recommended that he be transferred to a hospital nearby where they can give him the care that he needs. What... a hospital... What are you talking about? It's the doctor's opinion that Jude isn't capable of caring for himself at the moment. So he's gonna be transferred to Fleeger Hospital. The mental hospital? Go around! God! Come on, baby. Any suicidal thoughts? Where's Bobbie? How long has it been since you've taken a bath, Jude? I don't know. Where am I? Are you hearing any voices? No. Just yours. How's your mouth feeling? It's gravy. I just need some methadone, please. Could you please give me some methadone? No, Jude, we'll give you plenty of Tylenol. Fuck you! Agh! Fuck! Do you wanna take a shower, honey? I don't think I can walk. Oh... I can get you a wheelchair. I'm sorry. You'll be okay. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Just get through this and you're gonna be just fine. Okay. Ma'am. Oh, miss. M-miss, you can't be sleeping out here. I don't have anywhere else to go. You can't go back there. They don't let nobody back there. Is this... this fellow here the only family you got? My mom is back home in Missouri. Why don't you give your mother a call? - Oh, I... I can't. - Well, sure you can. You can use that phone right there because I dial out on that phone long distance all the time. I just can't. Thank you. Her husband... my stepdad, he's a doctor. Well, if he's a doctor, he should be able to help you. He's a... He's a hypocrite. Yeah? The state's been trying to take away his license for a while for prescriptions. He's on Oxycotin. Or he used to be. I don't know anymore. Hi, this is Bill calling for Roxy. I'm up in Evanston. Give me a call, 312... What would you say to Bobbie if she were here? Hmm. Probably something like, um... where you've been? Why didn't you come see me? Well, there are a lot of reasons why she couldn't come see you here. Do you know something that I don't know? You have to get well first. As soon as dove into the grass, the jet went past... and there was another one coming. So the blaze kept going. We saw the next jet coming down the runway. Lights coming closer and closer, and each time we did it, we let them get a little bit closer and a little bit closer. Hey, stranger. Hey. You know, it's gonna get cold out here tonight. Yeah, I just, um... I'm going to visit a friend. Ah. Well, I got some good news for you. Tonight is Wednesday night. You know what that means. That's Albert orders a pizza night. How do you know? My gal pal down in "C" took a look at his paperwork, and he's doing real well. So you don't gotta worry about him no more. Okay. I thought you had plans tonight. I cancelled. Oh, yeah? Pizza gets them every time. So... what is the plan? I don't know. Well, I'm not exactly a car mechanic but I could tell you right from the looks of that jalopy you're driving around in, you're not gonna make it much further than the bus terminal. Yeah. What about Jude? Hey, at some point... you have to take care of yourself. Took me too damn long to learn that. Well, I gotta make some rounds. You stay and enjoy the pizza. I'll be back. And, uh... you dial 9 and then the number. Just in case. Mom? It's Barbara. I'm sorry I'm calling so late. So what happens to cowboy in your story? I don't know. He's desperate and... he's willing to do whatever it takes no matter what. So one night he was out on this big bender. And he comes on this alley where these guys are brutalizing this poor young girl. And he just goes completely animal, you know, tears them apart, and then there's this guy laying there bleeding to death, and then this girl is looking up at him like he's her savior or something, but he's not. And, uh... he climbs on top of her, and he's gonna kill her. But they get him, the police. He's got this tear running down his face, and their machines plucked him out, and they haul him away to the trash compactors. Okay, I... just need you to sign there. Got it. So have you thought any more about your plan? Yeah, medical school. Really. Listen, if you don't do your outpatient, at least be sure to go somewhere, okay? Meetings, a sponsor. Promise? Yes. Okay. I just have to get a couple of more signatures, and you're good to go. And you have a visitor. I'll be back in a few minutes. I thought you were gone. I thought you were gone. Relatively. I don't know what to say. Jesus. I've never seen anything like you. Shut up. Oh, God. What have you been doing? How you been scoring? I called my mom. I've got to go home. Whoa. Is it okay? Yeah. What did Gary say? She said, "Fuck Gary." I'm her daughter, and she wants to help, so... I've got to go. That's great. She send you money? Um, she has a doctor friend who can help with my boob. And, um... there's meetings. That's great. She said that, um, if I showed up with you, she wasn't gonna let me in the house. Okay. Jude... What are you gonna do? We don't know what it's like, you know? It... it sucks. I mean, we lived together, but not really. And I just keep thinking... God, I thought that you were... And I just, um... I... I keep picturing the most mundane things, you know? Like, um... like how happy we'd be if we just had... a crappy futon and a place to watch bad TV and eat shitty pizza. Oh, God damn it, Jude, I just wanna eat shitty pizza with you. I want that, too, Bob. Do you, um... Do you want it enough to come to Missouri? You... you'd have to go to meetings every day, and you'd have to get a job and do... all those things I know you hate doing. Missouri is the "show me" state, right? Can you do it? For me? Shit, I almost forgot something. Come here. No, Jude, I've gotta get to the station. - Can we please just go? - Shh, trust me. Can we please just go? Jude. Shh, shh. Jude, God damn it, Jude. Look, do we need to do. I have to go. We're gonna do this one thing. I promise, that's it. Please I can't, I just... fuck, Jude! Please, please just let me go. - Please just let me go. - Bob, ssh! Bob, I need you trust me please. - I promise, I promise. - I can't, no, I can't! - Yes, you can, yes, you can. - I can't! Come here, listen to me. I swear to Christ if this is the last time that I'm gonna see you, I gotta... Will you let me do this one thing, please? - Please, let me go. - I will. - I will in a second, I will. - No, please, Please, Jude! Please, please! God damn it! Just come here. - You have to let me go! - I will. Stop, I can't! Is it all the same? And do you know my name? As I walk amongst the others As I lay under the covers Can I tell you that it's all fun in fact I don't mind but can't discover Who it is that steals my thunder It's hard to say Hard to say And I'll be on my way When I don't even know where to start How many ways can I go? Run, run I've been walking all over the rise Run, run It's so hard to stay focused I've been wasting all my time I've been wasting all my time.
