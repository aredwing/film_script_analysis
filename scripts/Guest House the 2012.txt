No, this weekend no, I'm grounded. Why? By staying out so late. What is it so late? Does reaching in time for breakfast? And you're surprised the I got you into trouble?

And he thinks we should go every man for himself. You know he's right. How so? Long Relationships distance, do not work. Sometimes if. In the history of the long distance relationships ... There is always one person ... committed, that is true. And a person who simply uses it as a convenience. - What convenience? - To go out with someone else in another city. I do not know ... The desirability of not having a real relationship. For 30 days in a month. A long-distance relationship is low maintenance relationship. So what you're saying, is that the long distance relationships are a sham? - Most if. - What if Uncle Sam recruits you or something? And you're out for six months or a year. - That's true ... - I mean, if you really love someone ... Should not matter ... time or distance. In a perfect world yes, but for some people being alone sucks. Do you know? If you're going to be with someone, you better be with that person. And if there is any other place where they are not ... You're wrong ... I do not know. When you love someone, no matter where you are. Never leave your heart. This ... is my favorite. - Are you sure this is okay? - It's more than good, it's great. I was not referring to the wine. - Oh! You mean I should not drink legally ... My mom used to say, that if you tell someone not to do something ... Going to do it ... well that since I have 14, I could drink a glass of wine at dinner. Well, I heard that wine is good for the heart. I agree with that. So are you sure that this is okay? You insisted that you open a bottle of wine, then this is for you, Girl Scout honor. - Did you go girl scout? - No. But ... if one, not lie right? So therefore I have some of that.

I was a little drunk, so your dad took me ... ... To his hotel room, to get sober. I was watching TV., He bathed and left the bathroom alone in robe. He sat down beside me. Colony had a very rich and me laugh. And the next thing I know is we were kissing. It was something of a Once, when I got up ... ... In the morning, you I said it was a mistake. And that does not happen again. He said no problem. Did not even know nothing of it, until ... Three weeks ... when offered me a job. I was in college. And I felt like I could do almost anything. I did not know where my future. He had opportunities. I've been with young boys. It is what it is. But do not know how it was, the be with an older man. I've never done before.
