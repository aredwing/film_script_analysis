[ Girl ] Every morning, as I drive away, I am reaching back for you. It is a helpless feeling, this wishing, this wanting, this knowing you will arrive... just minutes after I have gone. Well, I thought that was really freakin' good. [ Woman ] All right. All in favor of including this piece... in our spring issue, raise your hand. Nearly unanimous. And our author, Kolt. Sylvia Plath would be proud. Congratulations. Thanks, dude. Hi. Hey. - Um, hello. I'm Martine. - Hello. Hey. Hi. [ Chuckles ] I'm Peter. Let me grab this for you. Come on in. Thanks. Julie can't wait to meet you. What's making you feel so powerless? I'm way too afraid to even approach a woman... that might be on my intellectual level. I know what you're gonna say. It's not 'cause I'm afraid she'll reject me. I'm afraid I'll reject her. Okay. Why is that? You know, a lot of smart women think too much to look good... and talk too much to fuck well. I feel like such an asshole saying these things to a woman. I do get what you're saying, actually. 'Cause the movie comes out this week. Everyone's acting like I'm supposed to be excited, but I fucking hate it. And I wish I could say it looks nothing like the script I handed them, but they didn't change a goddamn line. I just wrote something that isn't very good. We're gonna need to stop. [ Groans ] Don't do this to me, Julie. I will see you on Wednesday. There's a lot of life that'll come out with the sound. There's... You know, like the bug's footsteps, or maybe his breath. You know, what would it sound like if you could hear the bug's heart beat? Or, like, heartache. What would that sound like? [ Chuckles ] You know? Yeah. All right. I think this'll be fun. Yeah. I'm really excited. Thank you so much for putting aside time to do this with me. Absolutely. So you're working on, like, a big studio movie right now? I am, yeah. They're not picture-locked yet. So you're in luck. Hey, Peter, is this a take-from-the-fruit-bowl night? Martine, this is Kolt. Kolt, Martine. [ Martine ] Hi. Hey. What is a take-from-the-fruit-bowl night? Oh, it just means that everyone's on their own for dinner. Nobody's taken responsibility as of yet. [ Chuckles ] [ Peter ] That's a maybe? Hey, David. Oh, hey, Kolt. Hey. I'm just getting out of here. Crazy plans? Just finishing up some things for Peter. How about you? Lots of homework? Not really. I already did this history thing that's due Friday. Well, it's good not to procrastinate. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. I do anyway sometimes though. Procrastinate. Oh, yeah. Of course. I'm giving you advice I can't take, so... [ Kolt Chuckles ] Eating bark in a tree. Slow or fast? Fast. Wind, and also sand blowing in the wind. Sounds that only ants hear. Ah, need to be more specific. You know what? We'll come back to it. Okay, gasping. Sticky stuff. Bowling pins. Blood on pavement. - Got it. - Really? Hey, come on. An old train. Okay. Um, bodies rubbing up against each other. Okay. So people having sex? Yes. But not like, "Uh, uh, uh." Okay. Good to know. [ Chuckles ] Hi, Dad. Hey, bud. Hey. Hi. [ Julie ] Is she coming to eat? Where is she? Jet lag. Is it gonna work out? I think so, yeah. She's really sweet. Good. I think she's really talented too. Hey, who is in the pool house? Her name is Martine, and she is a friend of my friend Miriam's, and she needed Daddy's help. - Hey, guess what. - What? My poem got into lit mag. Sweetness, that's fantastic. - Did you call your dad? - Not yet. Well, you know, he wrote poems before he wrote songs. And maybe one day, he will publish some of those poems, and he can buy us a hot tub. [ Camera Shutter Clicking ] [ Phone Ringing ] Wanna get that? Mm-mmm. No. - You sure? - Yeah. One of the kids will get it. No, they won't. They always let it go to the machine. And you never check the machine. [ Ringing Continues ] I'm coming. I'm coming. Hello? Hey, Avi. [ Chuckles ] No, I don't know where Sea Horse is. Hold on. Let me check. Kolt! It's Avi on line one. I don't want to talk to Avi, Peter. Okay. Why don't you tell him that yourself? [ Beeps ] Firm hand of a parent. Oh, so good. Nailed it. Get the arm in there. I gotta wash my face. What? I have to wash my face. All right, the TV's going back on. Them's the rules. [ Sporting Event On TV ] [ Sounds Amplified ] [ Squishing ] [ Rustling ] [ Pops ] [ School Bell Rings ] Hey, where you going? Class is that way. Oh, I'm not going. You want a section? I don't read Science, Finance or Sports. Yeah, I'll take Science. So, um, how's it going with David? Hmm? Oh. Um, it's complicated. I mean, there's definitely chemistry, you know, but the age difference. And he works for Peter, so... I think we're both just... a little afraid of where it could go, you know? Well, it's good to be cautious. You have plenty of time. We're only, you know, 16. [ Chuckles ] [ Scoffs ] I hate it when people say that. I don't know. What do you think? Look, sir, we don't need a pool cleaning. The pool is clean. I'm looking at it right now. David. [ Scoffs ] No, you know what? Just forget it. You're crooks anyway. My assistant. He's a good guy. Dusty's been upset about this dead lizard... that's been clogging the drain for like a week now, and I don't think the issue's worth $600. [ Peter ] This is our guest, Martine. She's the bug auteur. It's nice to meet you. Excuse me. [ Water Splashes ] Love that guy. Every time we don't have a big job going on, he just tries to fix what's broken in life. My life. Okay, what's next? Chimes? [ Shower Running ] And that is the power of directional microphones. They're kind of like magic wands. Here, come on. I want to show you something. All right, just lay down right here. Keep the headphones on. Close your eyes. You tell me, what do you think you're hearing? All right? Okay. [ Cars Passing ] I don't know. It sounds like... a concert, but far away. It's the highway. With those mountains in the back, it echoes through the entire canyon. - Wanna do another one? - Yeah. Close your eyes. Okay, what about this one? That sounds like wind going through trees. I'll buy that. Okay. Tell me what you hear... now. [ Chuckles ] [ Man Speaking Italian ] But what kind? I'm tired. [ Italian ] [ David ] Hey, buddy. Hey! Ah, you looking to brawl? You're Julie. Wow! Can I hug you? Yeah, let's hug. I'm pro-hug. I can't believe it. I'm meeting you. One of the original members of Miriam's postfeminist wolf pack. I've seen pictures of you guys, like, sitting around swimming pools looking focused. It-It seems like it was an amazing time. I don't know. Buonasera. [ Peter ] Ciao, guys. - Hey, Kolt. - Hi. Hi. Hi. I really like your jeans. Thanks. Do they have zippers on them? Um, yeah, they... they do. [ Chuckles ] Hey, you want to take off? [ Martine ] Uh, yeah, we should. Um, he's taking me to my friend's art opening. Yeah, I... I can't drive. I'm a New Yorker. [ Chuckles ] I'm clinging to that as my excuse. - Can you drive? - No. No, not yet. But we will be practicing very soon. Yes, we will. Yeah. Okay. - You hungry, Sea Horse? - Not really. Hey, remember. 9:00 a.m. tomorrow. Actors. Yes. I will be there. And, Julie, I'm sorry that we didn't get a chance to talk. - Oh, we will. - Okay. Julie, is it possible to get my check? Yes. I'm so sorry. I'll be right back. [ Car Engine Starts ] [ Scoffs ] There is a mammal that lays eggs. Platypus, Avi! Platypus. I gotta go. [ Sniffs ] Thank you for coming with me tonight. No, thank you for bringing me. Um... I don't think... that I should do this right now. Okay. I just... I just got here. And I'm here to work. And I think it's smarter to forgo this type of... Anyway, this was really nice. Really nice. [ Car Door Closes ] [ Bang ] Ah! [ Cell Phone Ringing ] Ah. Mmm. [ Sighs ] Martine, you're alive. Doug. Hey. Am I waking you up? Um... God, no. I've been awake for a couple hours already. Everything going all right? Yeah, it's going great. [ Indistinct ] Um, I haven't seen it yet. Um, but as soon as I get my Internet, I'm gonna... [ Indistinct ] No. No, no, no, no. Yeah, we'll definitely finish on time. Okay. All right. Talk to you later. Okay. Okay. Ugh. Hi. I'm... I'm sorry I'm late. I, um... I couldn't find the dialogue that I wrote. That's okay. Let's, uh, make a couple copies of this. Hi. I'm Martine. Hi. Nice to meet you. Thanks for coming, guys. Sure. Whoo. Okay. So the reviews are in. Some great, some good. A few really hostile ones, of course. How are the reviews making you feel? I don't want to talk about the reviews. Okay. I had a dream last night. Another one about your grandmother? No. It was about you. All right. Am I allowed to tell you about it? Of course. Um, I was on set, in the house that we shot in... that weird glass box in the Valley... and David Strathairn was eating cereal out of a megaphone. [ Chuckles ] I had a break. Something drew me to one of the bedrooms. I opened the door... [ Clears Throat ] You were lying on the carpet, and, um, you were all dressed up in full lingerie. You know, lacy bra, thong, stockings. Those things that you use to clip your stockings to your panties. - I don't remember what they're called. - Garters. I was excited. I walked over, started to touch you, softly at first, and then... more. You were just ignoring me. You were all dressed up like you wanted to fuck, but you were totally unresponsive. [ Clears Throat ] So I started talking to you. What were you saying? I just said, "Hey, baby. I'm here. We're not done shooting, but they don't need me. Do you need me?" You still didn't respond. I started to get upset. I was begging. Which is not really my style. I took my pants off. Because I just... I just needed you to know that I was hard. And I looked at you and I said, "I love you." And then we were fucking. It was that easy. [ Woman ] Psst. Come over here. [ Man ] What? I found it. Where? Right here. On the ground. - Is it safe? - It's sticky. Okay. Um, I liked that. Um... Uh... Ken. Ken. Yes. Um, I'm sorry. Um, I want something a little harder, I think. Like you're a protective husband, um, but you're a little bit scared. You're talking about when I'm asking the question? Yes. Um, you're still soft and scared. Um, a little less blatant. Um, like... like... like you're really asking the question. But I'm asking the question because I'm scared? Right. Um, but you're not, like, sitting in your fear. Um, I just mean, like, um, y-your fear, um, it doesn't hinder you. Like, you fear, yet you're motivated by your fear. This is what happened in the other scene. We did eight takes of that, and... I have no idea what the difference is between any of 'em. Well, I think it's good to just take adjustments. I'm not an actor who minds taking adjustments, as long as a director is actually saying something. I mean, have you ever worked with actors before? 'Cause it seems like your thing's bugs. She used to take naked photos of her boyfriend. I googled you. I think they're really beautiful. [ Peter ] Listen. We really appreciate the help. All right, you're gettin' paid. Why don't you do what she says? [ Ken ] You're barely covering my gas. And she's not telling me to do anything. [ Sighs ] I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry. [ Sighs ] You all right? Okay, I'm not even that upset right now. It's just, like... I'm sorry, Peter. [ Sighs ] I really didn't want that to happen. What are you talking about? You didn't do anything wrong. That guy just didn't get it. [ Groans ] Ugh. [ Sighs ] Hey. Hey. Are you all right? Is there something else goin' on? [ Chuckles ] Don't be so hard on yourself. [ Exhales ] Thank you. [ Clattering ] I heard something. Did you hear something? I think someone's outside. It's David. Okay. Um, I should... I should go. - I'm sorry. - No. No, no, no. It's no trouble. I don't even know why you're wasting your time on this. I want to help. It's, uh... I think you're really someone who's, uh, worth helping, so... Okay. [ Clears Throat ] Hey, brother. Hey, man. [ Julie ] Hey. Are you a free set of hands? Um, yeah. I'm a terrible cook though. That's all right. Just chop this parsley real quick, and then you can get back to work. Okay. Getting into it? What? Are you getting a lot of work done? Oh, yeah. Totally. Completely. So much work, yeah. You know, I just realized I saw your work once. At Miriam's. You were staying there, I think. Oh, yeah. She let me keep my, um, stuff there during the lawsuit. The lawsuit because your boyfriend didn't want to be photographed? Um, well, I guess he felt... that I manipulated him into posing naked. Ouch. Yeah. It was not awesome, no. Um, but I learned a lot. We don't have to talk about this. So, you used to live in New York? I did, yeah. Where do you live? I used to live in Hell's Kitchen with my ex-boyfriend, um, but I'm in Brooklyn now with roommates. Two roommates. What are you, 23? Yeah. Twenty-three. I was going to CalArts. Sort of. Why sort of? Because my main gig was being a girlfriend. To Leroy, who you will meet tonight. It's not a career I'd recommend. It only took me, I don't know, 20 years to get my life together. Just keep doing what you're doing. Mmm. All right, flee. You're free. Are you sure you don't need more help? No, this looks good. I'll see you at 7:00. Okay. [ Peter ] When did you find out you were gluten intolerant? [ Man ] I was with, uh, Rod Stewart. He was, like, having a dinner party or something. He was talking about, you know, this whole gluten thing. I was like, "Well, tell me, you know, what is gluten?" 'Cause nobody really knows what gluten... [ Julie ] I know what it is. Some... I don't know. I don't know. Okay, I'm in the bathroom, right? And this was, like... Do you even know who Peter Frampton is? These guys don't even know who Peter Frampton is. -You know Peter Frampton. -[ Julie ] I know who Peter Frampton is. Well, he doesn't know. You never heard of Peter Frampton. No, I've never heard of Peter Frampton. But enough... enough about me. It's not about me tonight. To Julie. For giving me something... [ Scoffs ] No. For giving me something like home. Thank you. Do you still live in a bus? Sometimes, dude. But hopefully not again this year. I'm so sick of the road. [ Clears Throat ] I'd like to say thank you to Julie and Peter as well. - I feel very lucky. - Oh, it's our pleasure. You're very welcome. - Julie, you look beautiful. - Mmm. No, seriously. I mean, you look about the same age as our daughter. - [ Chuckles ] - I don't, but thank you. But you got this big guy over here, huh? Mr. Handsome. [ Chuckling ] So, Peter, um, I hear that your mixing board is where my practice space used to be? - Is that right? - Well, the room was already soundproofed. - I'm glad someone's getting some use out of it. - [ Chuckles ] - Peter just got a huge studio movie. - You're kidding. So he's gonna be working down in Hollywood. - Is that right? - Amazing. That's great, man. That's totally great. So, Martine, what do you make? - What's the inquisition? - I just want to know. What do you make? Right now, it's, um... it's images of bugs. - Bugs? - A film, actually. Peter is helping me with the sound. When's your movie come out? It... It actually doesn't really come out. Well, it's gonna be running on a loop on her first solo show. A loop? [ Peter ] Which is at a gallery. It's a big deal. I don't know about big, but it's some kind of deal, I guess. Come on. Give him the spiel. It's so much fun to hear you talk about it. Come on. Oh, I don't know. You've got a great thesis statement. Leroy would appreciate it. It's basically, uh, humans versus nature, and, uh, the personal versus the... sort of intricate complexities of community. Listen. At the end of it, what you take away from it is... What is that e.e. cummings line? "You can understand a poem without knowing what it means." [ Chuckles ] You shouldn't talk about work around the table anyway. I learned that the hard way. Uh, excuse me for a second. So, baby girl, your mom tells me that, uh, you had a poem accepted to a literary magazine. Two actually, yeah. Wow. Beautiful and smart, huh? Excuse me. Excuse me. [ Leroy ] Tell me. Tell me. It's amazing. [ Kolt ] Yeah. I don't know. I didn't think they were gonna like both of them. [ Knocking On Door ] [ Martine ] Just a second. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. You don't sound fine. [ Toilet Flushes ] [ Leroy ] I remember once I was opening for Wilco, and I couldn't remember a line. I sang, like, three songs... I was just making up the words. I swear to God, it was awful. - Yeah. - She's okay. What happened? I thought maybe I offended you or something. No. I'm sorry. Um, I'm impossible to offend. I just, uh... Um, the tempeh was so good, I... I forgot I'm allergic to it. [ Chuckling ] Well, good. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Hey, I have a question. Mm-hmm. Is Leroy ever gonna stop wearing flannel shirts and Doc Martens? I mean, the guy's like a cartoon character. Or like an Amish person. One outfit? Really? I mean, he does have the money... to get, like, a variety of apparel. I think the only reason why I'm asking is... I think I was legitimately confused at dinner as to what year it was. So you wanna talk about dinner? What? You wanna talk about your little crush on our houseguest? Excuse me? What? Did you not hear me? No, I definitely heard you. What are you talking about? What do you have an issue with? I don't have an issue... when you bring your ex-husband over and make googly-eyes at him all night. -Give me a break. We have a child together. -What difference does that make? I understand you're attracted to her. She's attractive. I'm fucking attracted to her. Okay. What... What are we talking about? [ Sighs ] Just don't embarrass me. [ Soft Rustling ] [ Beeps ] It just sounds really canned. Canned? Yeah, like flat. Ear fatigue. It's an actual phenomenon. Afflicts many. I think your ears are tired. I think it's the echo. Can we just take it out? I think we need a break. I think we need to finish this scene. Honestly, I think if we come back to it with fresh ears, it'll be better. Peter, we really need to, like, get through this. Come on. Okay. [ Exhales ] [ Rustling, Chittering ] [ Rustling Stops ] - Listen. About, um... - Yeah. the other day in the pool house... Look. I'm really sorry. I... No, no. I, um... I find you incredibly charming... and intelligent and beautiful. I respect what you do. It makes me excited about what I do. And I think I just got, uh... just carried away in that mix of, uh, feelings. Peter, it doesn't have to be a big deal. We can just pretend it never happened and... Marriage is complicated. I think we should just keep working on this right now. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. [ Chuckles ] [ Clears Throat ] [ Rustling ] [ Rustling Stops ] [ Scoffs ] I'm sorry. Your physical presence this close to me is actually painful. This house is, like, um, full of people. Don't worry about it. This room is completely soundproofed. [ Birds Chirping ] Vroom! [ Moaning ] [ Thumping ] [ Both Moaning ] Panino? Mmm. I don't know how to say it. [ Sighs ] Hmm. It's called a slip. [ Crickets Chirping ] You ready for bed? Where's my cookie? [ Chuckles ] What cookie? You ate the last cookie? [ Chuckles ] No. There are no cookies left. [ Chuckles ] You suck. Are you coming to bed, or are you gonna keep reading? I'm gonna keep reading. All right. My breath just happens to smell like chocolate... chip cookies. Mmm. Oh, have more. Do you like Avi? Well, yeah. I do. I think he's really sweet. Do you like Avi? I don't know. I mean, he's certainly not like my fantasy boyfriend or anything. Yeah. Wow. Your dad... seemed like the fantasy boyfriend. But he wasn't. No. He wasn't. So then, how do you know when you've found the right guy? I don't know that you do know. I think you're just... you're ready, and you pick one. That's... really depressing, Mom. No, I... I don't think it's depressing. I-I... I think... I think people change and, uh... and you keep changing and... you make a decision to change together, or... you split up. Um... See you in the morning. Good night. Sleep well. [ Sighs ] Hi. Hey, what are you doing here? Can I swim with you? I think you need to have a... a grown-up as a lifeguard. You're a grown-up. Um, well, that's a good point. I'm just... I'm not very... Anyway, let's get you back to bed, okay? I won't splash anymore. I promise. Can you take me back to my room? - Um... - It's dark. I... I don't want to wake your parents up. We can walk on tippy-toes. Okay. Man. These stickers... I had stickers like that when I was your age, except I also had, like, birds and bees and stuff. They only had outer space stuff at the Creativity Store. Well, it's looking good in here. Mmm. Okay. Okay. Good night. ## [ Amplified Synthesizer Notes ] ## [ Continues ] So, we can listen to what he's doing on the synth... with the ambient sounds already in if you want. Yeah, that would be super helpful. ## [ Note Trilling ] Seems like he wants to play on the synth more than actually work on the film. We'll make it good. Don't worry. ## [ Continues ] Hey, David, do you want to run to the store... and pick up that squishy food for the Foley? I just want to finish before the party tonight. Uh, you don't want to finish this first? That's okay. I think Martine can run the board. Copy that. Uh, back in 20. ## [ Continues ] [ Door Closes ] ## [ Continues ] I don't know how to work the board. It'll be fine. Just hit space bar, come back here and watch it with me. Okay. ## [ Strikes Note ] Ready? ## [ Continues ] [ Rustling ] [ Squishy Noises ] ## [ Continues ] [ Squishy Noises ] I think I want synth in the whole movie. ## [ Continues ] [ Squishy Noises Continue ] Okay. David, you can take Martine. The kids can ride together. Great. Oh. Okay. You know where you're going? [ David ] Yeah. ## [ Speakers: Folk Rock ] [ Woman Whoops ] [ Chattering ] [ Man, Woman Laughing ] [ Woman ] There you go. Get some more. No. [ Chuckles ] [ Coughs ] [ Chattering ] No, that's all part of it. [ Coughs ] It works better when you cough. You guys don't know that? ## [ '60s Pop ] # Sun # # Lying in the sun # # Had a lot of rain in the winter # # All I want is the sun # # Doesn't everyone # # Have a little pain from time to time? # It's the inevitable run-in. Inevitable? Well, it's a small town... at least the parts of it that we inhabit. Gosh. You look amazing. Thank you. It's good to see you. Are you a friend of Rosa's? You're not allowed to say? Hmm. Can we go somewhere and talk? Ha, ha. Very funny. Mm-mmm. I want to be alone with you. Um... I don't think that's a good idea. Are you sure? You look like you might. - Might what? - Want to... be alone with me. # Sun # # Lying in the sun # # Had a lot of rain in the winter # # All I want is some peace for a minute # # All alone in the sun ## Where have you been? I've been looking for you. My mom is stoned. It's hilarious. Let's get out of here. [ Chattering ] ## [ Dance Pop ] ## [ Man Singing, Indistinct ] ## [ Continues ] [ Sighs ] I need to tell you something. Take a walk with me. I can't. I'll see you on Monday. Take a walk with me. You don't know how crazy you make me. Well, then I guess I'm not doing my job, am I? [ Chuckles ] You're too witty to... be a professional listener. I have to go find my daughter. Mm-mmm. Just give me a minute of your time. This has already gone too far. [ Mutters Softly ] Drop your glass. [ Clatters ] [ Chattering ] If you moved here, you could live on the West Side. You can walk on the West Side. I don't like the beach. Hey. Hey. What's up? I gotta get out of here. - [ David ] Let's-Let's go. - Okay. Oh. I forgot my bag. [ Birds Chirping ] All right. All right. I'll see you inside. Yeah. I'll... I'll see you soon. [ Chuckles ] Hey, Peter. I gotta go. [ Door Thuds ] Hey. What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? What? You want to fuck me up? Fine. You were doing a pretty damn good job of it before you had to go fuck my assistant. Okay. Whoa. I'm not trying to fuck with you. I'm... I didn't mean for this to happen. This whole time I was... I was feeling something. I was feeling like there was some sort of connection between us. But that was all bullshit. I'm taking all my time, and I'm doing this for you. And you go and you betrayed me. Betrayed you? But, dude, you're married. That's right. I'm married! With a family! And now I have to go figure out a way to fix this. I'm just here trying to work, and you're all over me, and I'm just doing what I have to do to get my shit done. [ Chuckles ] Take your files and figure out a way to fix your own movie. [ Water Hose Running ] [ Clatters ] Fuck! [ Rustling ] ## [ Synthesizer: Discordant Notes ] [ Beeping ] [ Multiple Sound Effects ] [ Groans ] [ Beeps ] [ Sounds Stop ] [ Groans ] I want to learn to say some more practical words. I don't know. What's the word for "suitcase"? Suitcase? Yeah. What's the word for "suitcase"? I'm not a poet. Some poems. Ah! No. No. Angry poems. Angry poems. In English. "Sometimes there's a person who you know looks right. Their skin is fine, like a linen cloth, and their hair is the color of night. And they walk. And when they walk, that walk makes ladies turn to their window and admire. All the ladies in the town, with their secret things that they want. You were this man... in the town from which you came, but this... this is not your town. And when you speak, your words are snakes I swat at with swords. They crawl into parts of me, and I kill them with kindness I can't afford. I see you... with the accurate eyes of the sun. You think you're imprinting yourself in my memory, a man with the power to teach. You will never have anything or anyone you want, least of all... me. If I were to tell my mother and the others, we would laugh at you, louder than we have all along." I don't understand. You don't understand? Basta! - Who the fuck is this? - iVamos! iVoy a llamar a la polica! iAhora! That's Spanish. I'm Italian. I don't give a shit. Get out. [ Door Closes ] [ Exhales ] Are you okay? I'm okay. I don't know about that plant though. [ Chuckles ] I just don't want to have to explain it. We can get that cleaned up before anyone sees it. My mom's gonna be so mad I don't have a tutor anymore. I provoked him... with my angry poem. Maybe he provoked you into writing an angry poem. I'm supposed to take the Italian S.A.T. too. I didn't think there was anyone in the house. Yeah. I was just coming back from a long walk. A walk where? I got down to Hyperion, and then I turned around and... Someone pulled over because they thought I was a prostitute. Maybe they just thought you were hot. Well, not the way that Italian fellow thinks you're hot. He throws things, he gets so excited. [ Chuckles ] I want Martine gone by tomorrow. I'm sure you understand why we need to terminate. Terminate? I have a list of names, qualified colleagues. Oh, God. Oh, God. What happened between us... was an incredible breach of professionalism... and is not the way I want to conduct myself. Really? Not even a little bit? Kolt, come in. The water's hot. I don't really feel like getting wet. Mom just blew up the purple raft. You can go in that and not get wet. [ Dusty Giggling ] [ Both Giggling ] Kolt. We can do a somersault. Let's do them at the same time. One, two, three. [ Splashes ] [ Sizzling ] Smells good in here. It's Dusty's favorite. I'm leaving. I'll call you a cab. No, there's one on the way already. Oh. [ Plate Clinks ] I'll send your files in a few days. [ Pot Clanks ] [ Knife Slicing ] I'm thinking of adding more synth. I think it'll be good. Thank you. All right, all right. [ Dusty ] Oh. Let's... Who wants it? Grilled cheese! Oh, I didn't know you wanted one. [ Giggles ] No, these are for me and Sea Horse. No, no, no. - Grilled cheese! Grilled cheese! - No, no, no. Those aren't yours. This isn't yours. You go in here. All right, fine. You can have one. Grilled cheese! Grilled cheese! This is mine. I want this one. How's the water? It's good. It's nice actually. Ooh. It's cold. It's not that bad. [ Shouts ] After all that hard work? [ Giggles ] Thanks for lunch, by the way. [ Car Door Closes ] Hey. I'm, uh... I'm heading out. Back to New York? Yeah. Back tonight. Thank you again so much for everything. You have a really amazing home. Okay. And if you ever come to New York, or... if Kolt is interested in RISD... This is probably the last you'll be hearing from anybody in this family. Good luck with your film.
