I knew you were stubborn, but this is more than that. My heart gave me trouble. It tested me. I survived this time. But I don't know about the second time. Come on Aziz, stop whining; now it's our turn... I will not die before shooting this film. It's great if Azrael is favoring the film-makers. We can shoot one after another, huh? Don't delude yourselves. God will say "stop" and there won't be any film anymore. This movie business is not like in the old days Aziz. We need a lot of money. - I sold everything. - Everything? - The pension? - Yeah! Even the pension. The boat, the car, whatever I had. I brought this with me: "The Blood-Brothers". Have you lost your mind Aziz? How can you rely on just one movie? What will I do with the money? There is no one to leave behind. The town I've been to was like heaven. It has great weather, the locals and nature is breathtaking. Yes, I finally found peace there. But still something is missing. But I couldn't shake off that feeling. I put my life in the line for this. Shall we shoot this movie? Are you with me? I'm with you buddy! You? Stop asking rhetorical questions. - To your movie... - To our movie. To our movie. I want the soundtrack right away. I want to hear the music while shooting the movie. I need an advance payment first. OK. Here you go. Everything will be the same as before. We will gather the full team again. Music by: 'Cemil Tezer'. Lighting by: 'Ekrem Demir'. Chief Assistant: 'Salim Turgut'. Storyboard: 'Rza Yenign'. Aziz... - Stage Supervisor: '... - Aziz! Rza... - When did he pass away? - Last year. When he was in the hospital you know what he said? 'Screw everyone who cries for me after I am gone. ' Aziz, who will be the leading actor? I'm thinking of Cihat. What! Isn't he a bit old? No, I wrote this role for him. It can't be someone else. Then the leading actress is Leyla? No way. Why not? Didn't you write this role for Leyla? That is another story. So, who is going to play that role then? We will find someone. Don't be ridiculous Aziz... Stop fooling around... You wrote the entire script for her. If Leyla is not in the movie, forget it then, it won't be the same. Stop, stop it! Leyla won't be in this movie. You got it? She will not! Aziz, thirty years have passed since then. You couldn't get over it yet? I did. I have closed that Leyla page. I've closed it forever. Paspas come here, here sweetheart, come... - Hi, hello... - Welcome Adalet. I was so happy when I heard it. I couldn't sleep at all last night. You are so secretive! How could you keep this good news to yourself all this time? Good news? Look at you! Still not spilling the beans. OK, sweetheart I am not going to ask you to... ...get me a part in the movie. I won't nag you, I swear. - What are you talking about? - "The Blood-Brothers". "The Blood-Brothers"? It is hard to believe. After all these years you will play the leading actress. - Aziz is back. Right? - You did not know? Is someone else getting the part? He is back, huh? Did I drop a brick? I am sorry Leyla, but how could I know? I'm such a blab. But I heard, they were gathering the team and I thought you... Anyway, forget about it. Look, why don't we get something like a cake and go over there... ...to celebrate and wish them good luck? You will see everything will turn out okay. No way! I am not wanted there. I won't. Hey, you watch it, I don't want goofing around at the set. Come on now... You think I would do something like that? Absolutely! How can we trust you? Watch your words Ekrem. You are talking to the Chief Assistant here. What a Chief? You are only a lottery-man. I only make my living from it. My profession is film-making you know. Hey, stop teasing him. Look he has already found the locations where... ...we will set up to shoot the movie. Did you, really? Why don't you tell then? You didn't let me. I have found a perfect place for the leading actress' house. - My uncle's place fits perfectly. - The waterside residence? - Ready. - How much will it cost? Nothing! Instead the owner will have a small role in the movie. Nonsense. This is not a kid's game. Then you will shake hands for one and a half bucks per day. - One and a half? - Billion... We will see. We still have to rent the equipment... ...build the team and arrange the actors. We have a lot to do. Lots of stuff. It has always been that way. What is it, is it now difficult because you are getting old? Did you find Cihat? No, that is a mystery, he has vanished into thin air. Shit. Couldn't make it... - A phone number, an address? - No, I couldn't find anything. What kind of assistant are you? You are not capable of finding the actor. Now it is my fault? The man is missing. Nobody knows where he is. We don't even know if he is alive. But he is alive? Isn't he? Yeah, sure... Well, hopefully... He had sent a letter to me asking... ...my help with a problem of his. - When? - 15 years ago. Did he mention his address? - Where did he mail it from? - I don't know. Wasn't there any postage stamp on the envelope? I guess so... Then find the letter. He may still be at the same address. Tatyos? He is in a nursing home I heard... - Nursing home? - Yeah. Was he unable to work? Have you ever met anyone who will come out of... ...a nursing home to be a cameraman? I didn't, but it doesn't mean it's impossible. If needed he will get out of the nursing home... ...and undertake his job. Chill out; are we going to fight over this? Speaking of fighting... Hakk was assaulted. - Hakk? Which Hakk? - The producer Hakk. No! How is he now? In the hospital, he took a bad beating. Let me have some fresh air. After that we'll visit Tatyos. But why would someone attack a man that age? Time has changed master. Nowadays no one has mercy. But why did they do it? Who beat him? Come on in, come on, Come on in. Enter that way... - Hey buddy, are you all right? - Are you okay? - Help him get up, are you feeling okay? - Are you alright? I'm fine, I'm fine, thanks, I'm okay, thank you. A glass of water sir? - You? - Yes, it is us... Aren't you going to welcome us? - Aziz... - Finally. My dear brother. I thought you became senile. - Ekrem, my brother... - You see, we found you. I'm so glad you did. Don't stand on your foot, sit down here. When I heard about the nursing home, I thought you were crippled. But thank God you are in good shape. Neither illness nor old age but life itself crippled me Aziz. If you loose hope, if you don't have any direction in life... Anyway, what made you come here to stanbul? We are shooting the movie. Good, at least you have a purpose. - We have a purpose! We. - We? Yeah. You also are part of the crew. You don't think I will be the cameraman, do you? Me... The cameraman... Please, for my sake. For goodness sake Adalet, what are we going to do there? You will do the same as we do. Just have a drink and have fun, women to women, that's all. - But I don't know your friends. - Doesn't matter. What are we going to talk? Don't be ridiculous Leyla. 'No' is not an option. You are coming with me, that's it. You are so persistent Adalet. Okay, I will go with you. Great, I knew you would say yes. I used to have an assistant, but couldn't trust him. I was worried that he might have ruined the film since... ...he was young and inexperienced and he might make mistakes. I have put a check mark on all the film bobbins, I thought I did. But apparently I didn't. I skipped over 2 of them; then I over-shot them... Such a bullshit... Take it easy, everyone makes mistakes. - Yeah! You are right. - Yeah, take it easy. You will hear a few cuss words, you will be upset for a while... ...and then everything will be forgotten. That is not what happened though. No? In the beginning I felt sorry, but as time passed I turned mad at myself. I thought they would not offer me a job for a while. But when the producer sued me... Sued you? Bastard! I wasn't mad at him. He was right. - He had spent a lot of money. - Whatever he spent! He didn't go hungry, huh? Some guts he has. So what did the court say? Not surprisingly, I was found guilty. To pay for the damages I had to sell everything. After that I ended up with nothing. And since that day I never touched the camera again. Go ahead find yourself another usefull cameraman. And let me just rot here. Well, whatever happened is now past my friend. After all you are with us. We won't let you go. Just forget it. I did that shit myself so I deserve the punishment. I won't even shoot a photograph for the rest of my life... ...let alone shooting a film. I was tempted and came here but... Stop grumbling. Thanks to me you got out and got some fresh air. So why didn't they show up yet? Such a coincidence. What's up? Are you drinking without us? Why don't you sit down? No, no, we are supposed to meet some friends... Stop worrying about your friends. Have a seat, let's chat. Welcome Aziz. I heard you are shooting your movie, I'm so glad. We will see... I still look young, don't you think so? - Welcome... - Thanks. We can't stay for too long. Your friends are awaiting. Which friends Leyla? Sit down. Sit there. I'll sit near you. Yeah, sit down. Please go on, I need to go. Aziz! Aziz! I didn't know. Adalet brought me. I can guess. But this is, walking away is hurtful. I said I had to go. We are not able to exchange a few words after all this time? The world changed, the maps changed... ...but you remain the same. How can a man carry all this anger with him after all these years? Did you ever wonder why I moved to such a small... ...remote town? Because, there were no movie theatres there. There wasn't any chance to see your poster. I fled from you. I have drawn back from you to save my mind. It is all over. All remained in the past. No, nothing remained in the past. It has been 30 years but your posters are still on the walls... ...and I'm obliged to walk through these streets. - It was my life. - Wasn't it mine too? Is it fair to see the woman I love in that situation? - Isn't it cruelty? - Don't blame me Aziz. - I didn't give you my word. - I was going to propose you. - But, you didn't. - If you were patient enough... Even my cues were ready. I was going to say: 'Will you play the leading role in my movie and my life?'. But you have chosen to play in those kinds of movies. Everyone was in those films; the lighting crew, the cameraman... But you shouldn't have. You made your choice, A choice without Aziz. I only had one alternative. A way to walk without Leyla! Have you ever made a soundtrack to a sex film? - No, why did you ask? - Nothing, just curiosity. - Now I remembered, I did once. - What? I took it from Bilal. No job, no money at those times. I gave 2 or 3 pieces in return of that money. Then I heard he used them in a sex film. Thank you, good job, thank you very much. There it is. - Searching for a man without any evidence. - What? God help us. All we have is that one letter. Come on, stop grumbling. Hello, hi. - Hi there. - Hi. Officer, was this letter mailed from here? - Yes, why? - Then, you know Cihat. - Pardon me? - Cihat Alkan, the famous actor? Yes, I know. I have watched some of his films. But what is the connection? Because he had posted this letter from this village. - We believe he lives here. - Are you kidding us? What will such an actor do in this village? Yeah, this is such a god-forsaken place. But he must be here. Look my friend, I have been living here for 40 years... ...and no actor ever came here. - Are you saying that no one but the villagers live here? - Yes. Are you sure? We came all the way here. There is someone at the top of the hill. But he is nuts. Nuts? May it be him? He is mad! No one knows who he is... ...but he has been living on that hill on his own for years... Can you please describe that place? He can't be the man you are looking for. - Let us take our chance. - You'd better not. The house is there! This is nonsense. No... We were living in the middle of concrete. No way Cihat could live in there. - He must have lost his mind? - Even you? If he is as mad as they have told? Cihat... No, Cihat won't go mad. Then, this must be someone else. We will figure it out. Hi there? Are you there? Stop it you bullshit. Don't shoot. Be quite. Don't drive the nutty crazy. Don't say a word. Piss off, walk away or I will shoot. This is not Cihat. He is really nuts, let's go. - Where are you going? - Didn't you say... ...I'm not going to die before shooting the film? Let's not then; instead shoot the film. Hold on a second. Cihat, is it you? This is Aziz and Cemil, your best friends, remember? Fuck your Cihat? Who is that Cihat? Look at us! We came all the way from stanbul... ...in order to comprehend with a crackers. If you don't piss off immediately, I'll fill your heads with bullets. Cihat have a look, we brought you raki. I'm not drinking. It's harmful. What the hell are you doing Aziz? - Then I will break the bottle. - Stop, don't waste it. - You are Cihat. - I'm not. I am going to shoot you. Aziz lay down, he is really nuts. Okay, I am not responsible for the rest. One; are you Cihat? - No! - Sorry for the raki. - Two; Are you Cihat or not? - I'm not the fucking Cihat. OK, how you wish, pity for the whole bottle of raki. Three... I was sure you will not waste a drop of raki. What if it wasn't me but a raving madman? I took my chance. To your luck. - You two got too old. - This is life. - Me? - You? - Did I get old? - Well... Well, what? - Same as we did. - Fuck you! So?... - The leading role! - The leading role? But you will bring your costumes. I wasn't the only lucky one. A leading role proposal to a man living in such a deserted place... ...without any address. Now I'm reading Cihat's mind: 'Let me read the script first, if needed I will ask for changes. ' Changes? The actor doesn't have a word to say about the script. I won't let you change a single word. - I quit cinema. - Don't talk nonsense. I wrote this character for you. No one else will play this role. Cinema is dead for me. "Deserted Lands" was my last film. A nice jubilee. Actors can't make jubilees. Actors stay on the stage till their last breath. Anyone can act, but I'm not in. Even not for my sake? I put all that I have, won't you support me? Ask for my life, it's yours, but please don't ask me that. - But why are you so rigid? - Forget about it. Please don't persist. Hey what are you doing? - Taking your picture. - Don't. I said no. Stop it. Don't take my pictures. Cihat Alkan will die young. He won't get old. He will die young. No one will see him in this shape. He will always remain handsome. He will always remain handsome. He will always remain handsome. Sorry for the camera. No problem. It was discarded as we are. Won't you say anything? Film or?... Are you mad at me? Your words are depressing. I'm not saying anything. Then your silence is depressing. Who is going to play this role? Willy-nilly Semih Altnba, under these conditions. What? How can you give him the leading role? He is very well disciplined. He is an usher. How would such a curtain operator dare acting. Everyone deserves a chance. You will ruin the film. At least find a proper man for the role. The problem will be over if you play that role Cihat. No I won't play but at least find someone proper. Let me think about it. Aziz... How can't one accept getting old? This is the rule of nature. Who could stand against it? Have you ever been in front of the cameras Cemil? Have you ever have had trouble walking in the streets... ...and thought everyone loves you? Could you handle all this? If we had been on the top it would it be easy to step back... ...to get old, and to become ugly... It is not easy Cemil. Not at all. Where will you put my name on the poster? Moreover, we need to talk on the script. Ekrem, Ekrem, they are back! - You found him, huh? - Of course. - Welcome! - Thanks. - Yeah, welcome! - Thank you. - You look the same. - Don't lie to me, I got old. Not at all, you have a different charm. - Seriously? - Let's take them to the hotel. Forget the hotel, you are staying with me. Of course we are not paying for the hotel, Aziz you are staying with me. OK, then. - Let's have tea first. Bar up the suitcases. - OK. Come on then. Have a seat. - Who is he? - My assistant, a new-hire. - You hired him? - Yes, isn't he quick-witted? Give him some time, let him perform a bit... ...then we will know for sure if he is eager or not. He is eager, he is. Isn't it too costly? Previously it was higher, but I gave up on several things... ...and reduced the price to this much. - Can't you get more of a discount? - Impossible. Son, why don't you go out, have some fresh air? Me? Yes, sure. I only have half of the money. Half? What are we going to do then? Well, I've got 10 thousand bucks. - No, I can't take it. - Why not? No, that is your guarantee for your future. We are close to death. What use of the money shall I make? You never know, you might need it sometime. Then, let me be your partner. Then your money will go to the bin. We may save it from the bin if you pay me back... ...from the returns of the film. Count me in too. Someone owes me 3.000 bucks... ...up to now I did not bother to ask for it but now... ...I will get that money and we'll become partners. And I had a car, Kartal. I didn't sell it when they offered I have a small stash. If needed I'll also ask around, let's just shoot this film. Thank you very much my friends, thank you. The equipments are in good shape, really good, but... The rent you are asking is so high, even more than the leading role's wage. - This is how the market is now. - Prices have gone too high. They are all imported equipments and are well-maintained. What if we only hire the equipments... ...but find the staff ourselves? - Not an option. This is a matter of principle. Can't you make more of a discount? No, otherwise I won't earn anything. Do you know who created Turkish Cinema? Who shot the first films, who brought which innovation? You are reluctant to rent these equipments to these film-makers... ...but you owe these men the equipments you own today. Pardon me? If they hadn't served Turkish Cinema, laid this foundation... ...just think if you could have all these equipments. Would there be anyone shooting any film today? Would you be earning money out of this? Well... I mean you owe your life, your job to them. Giving a discount isn't only a nice gesture... ...but your obligation to these gentlemen! What is your aim, to be a producer? - No, I want to be a film director. - You too? But first of all, I want to go abroad and study cinema... ...to learn it. Somehow, the new generation think they have mastered... ...the job from the start and oddly enough, believe that... ...they can handle the camera right away. At least we are done with renting the lighting equipment. I wonder if we can afford the remaining expenditures. Is the money in a deposit account? Why did you ask? - Why don't we open a time deposit account? -Time deposit? Then how can we spend the money? We can't draw it before the due time. - Well, how about mutual funds? - What funds? Mutual fund. Like a daily interest, free to be drawn any time. - It is true? - Of course! We can open a new account at a bank close to the main locations... ...and draw money for the daily expenses. Moreover we may earn some money. Let's say we may improve the catering services to the staff... ...or finance an additional day of shooting. Aziz, it makes sense to me. Okay then, good for you boy, you are a genius. Hey boy, have you been sent here to bring us luck? You are embarrassing me. People talk about the generation gap... Why did you call me? Why are you looking at me like that? - We ask you to tell an innocent lie. - Lie? Yeah, a lie that will lead to good deeds. You will go to Tatyos... Do you want me to lie to my master? Yes, you'll tell him that you were after his place. What the hell are you talking about? Listen up first. You will say: I always dreamed of being a cameraman... ...it was me erasing the check marks on the bobbins... ...and it wasn't your fault. What? No way! Why not? It will be my end if the word goes around. I will be discredited. - Don't worry, nobody will know. - It will finish my career. Look son, Tatyos' career has already ended. This is the only way to bring him back to the set, to life. - But I... - Promise, we will keep it in between. But still, excuse me. You have no other way, you will. - No way! - None! Have you ever been beaten by oldies? No, no, are you... Yes, the over-exposure of the films was my fault. Impossible, does it mean you deliberately... Yes, deliberately... I have coveted your place, I was bored of being an assistant... ...and my goal was to be a cameraman. You? How could you do that to me? I know it is a big stupidity, maybe ignorance. Please forgive me. Forgive you? You fucked my life! Master, master, don't, calm down. - You bastard! - Just a second... Stop, don't run away. Master, don't hit me. Just a second, let me explain... Come here, explain it to this. - Leyla, what are you doing here? - Waiting for you. - Me? - Yes... What is this? I just wanted to make a small contribution. - For the film? - Yes... - No, I can't take it. - Why not? He won't give you a part in the movie. Doesn't matter. Besides, he won't accept your money, keep it. Then keep it between us. You may say someone has supported, buy negatives with this. Thank you. Give your word, he will not know about this. I promise, he won't. Let's take the plan in one shoot. - Tatyos... - What? Where do you take in one plan? Tatyos! Isn't he your assistant? Aziz, I do accept your proposal. What, you do? I have a last word to say to this industry. - Yeah, but you can't runaway then! - I walk my talk. What made you change your mind? I have nursed a viper on my bosom. Listen to this vagabond, this scroundel. He has things to explain. Working from morning till evening is not preferable. I'll come just before my shooting begins and... ...leave as soon as I'm done. I want the schedule one week ahead. So I'll know the working hours in advance. One more thing, I'll charge the cab if I work late. Okay, we'll let you know. OK. But be quick because I have 3 more interviews. Just for your information. Bye. Now son, we are shooting a cinema film named "The Blood-Brothers". We need an assistant, are you experienced? In other words, who did you work with? Hold on a second, are you questioning me now? - No. - No, not really. Only trying to find out if you are the appropriate one or not. If I am appropriate? What gives you the right to do that? What? What gives us the right to... - Have you ever asked me? - Asked what? - May be I did not like you. - How can you... No, well, you might be right in your own way. Which films have you shot up to now? Do you have any awards? Are your films on show in festivals? What will I get from you? You know what, you are already out of circulation. Hard to believe we are saying 'action'. At last. Pass me the schedule, lottery-man. Here you go, green-grocer! Look at him; wearing earrings. If you bungle again this time... - Of course not. - Of course you won't! Then how will you explain the bullshit in the past. Calm down Tatyos. He asked for your foregiveness, come on, forgive him. This scene is still the same, you haven't changed it. Yeah, I worked on it, tried to look from your perspective but... - So what? - Didn't make sense. What do you mean it didn't make sense? You claim I was talking gibberish? If I'm not comfortable with things, I won't have them in my script. And I'm not playing the film script I'm uncomfortable with. Unbelievable. You have absolutely no patience. Couldn't you wait till we go to the set? If you don't do as I say, then I'm not going to the set. You can't threaten me Cihat! You have forgotten who I am. You have also forgotten that I'm the fastest man picking... ...up his jacket to walk away. Driver drop me here. - Cihat, don't... - Driver stop here. I wish you success gentlemen! - Thank you! - Aziz, stop him. He can't touch my script. I really forgot this industry and missed even the fights. I will burn all my bridges if I have to. - Okay. - What's OK? Means OK. He said he'll look into it. - We will look into what? - Means we will find a mid-way. No, he must accept what I said. Don't back out Cihat, play the game... ...this is his film, let's find a mid-way. Come on, we are getting late, the work will be delayed. OK? I'll be the one behaving maturely again. - There it is. - Here we go. Banu, honey, you are sending me to the set... ...but there is no press or anything here... - Bar! - This is not acceptable, no... - Bar! Where is Bar? - Stop putting on make-up... ...while I'm on the phone. He told he'll be late, remember, he has an exam today. Such a determined boy. He is not only studying but working for his pocket money as well. - How long will it take? - Ready in 15- 20 minutes. - Then let's go together. - Where? To draw money from the bank. I'm not good at it but you can, let's go. When is your fashion show? - Your PIN number? - 1-1-1-1. Is it because you were afraid of forgetting it? How did you know? Because you are new at this password thing and... ...nowadays they ask for a password for everything. Let's draw 800 bucks. It looks like you gave me the wrong card. No, this is the only card I have. Is it? But there is no money here, it says zero. Maybe you are making a mistake. I'm sure there is no money in the account. Aziz, Aziz... He took all the money and disappeared, huh? He didn't look trustworthy to me. I thought he was sincere. He looked like a decent person. I didn't think he would do something like that. I can't understand, how could he... Such bullshit, the kid is stealing all our money... ...and we are just sitting with our arms tied. What can we do? Life didn't teach you anything Aziz, you are so naive. How can you trust a complete stranger? But I didn't give him anything. He did it through the net, so-called internet? - How? - Apparently he transferred... ...the money to his own account electonically. He gave me a piece of paper in the bank and asked me to fill it. I never thought he was opening an internet account. And then he managed the rest. God, what a world we are living in! In our times they would rob the banks with real guns. What are we going to do now, stop the set? What more! Didn't we vow to finish the film? How can you mention stopping now? How do you think we will pay for the equipment rental... ...staff's wages? This is over. OK, I got it. They said there is no way, they want the equipment back. We can't afford the negatives, can we? We have some but I'm not sure if it is enough to complete the film. If the set stops it means we can never finish it. Hey folks, may I have your attention? You know we had a problem and lost all our money. In other words this is over. Nothing to do unfortunately. Thank you for all your work, thank you. In fact it turned out right. I was thinking over and over what to do about... ...the new TV series proposals. Gentlemen take it easy, bye. From Bar. Bar? 'I'll probably be out of Turkey when you receive my letter.' Scroundel. He ran away? 'I'm not a thief, I did everything for my dreams.' Fuck your dreams, you faker! 'I'm going to study cinema with your money. Thanks to you my dreams will come true' He is making fun of us. 'Don't be upset, you were going to shoot that film in vain. Nobody was going to watch it. ' Asshole! 'I saved you from a big burden. You owe me thanks. You will be proud of me when I return from America. ' Bastard! - Asshole! - Traitor! How foolish I am! Don't be sad. How? You gave everything you have and you are all in... ...a difficult situation because of me. Never mind. What is done is done, come on now. So the adventure is over. What am I going to do now? Lately one young guy joked: 'Haven't you been taken out of circulation?'. I was mad at him at that time but he was right. Now it is time for us to be taken out. This is the day. - No, not yet! - No? This is inadmissible. What the hell are you talking about Ekrem? Come with me... They said they are old, useless and obsolete... ...but I didn't have the heart to discard them. Here is the wooden carriage, needs to be cleaned and fixed. Look we also have its rail. Here are the lamp stands. I know new ones are lighter but after all these are... ...standing as well. Here is the camera. Doesn't have a fixed engine speed, its speed varies. But if we can fix it, it may work, huh? Tatyos? If we could put them into circulation maybe... ...we won't be taken out, huh? I have a condition to play in this film. - What condition? - This film means a lot to me. Therefore I want a real actress in front of me. - I want Leyla. - What, you want Leyla? - If she isn't in, I'm not either. - Never. - This is my last word. - Me too. We have discussed it before. Why did you raise it again? - Because we need Leyla. - We don't! - Is it you calling the shots? - Yes, I'm the director! OK, you are the director, but not the king! The scenario belongs to me as well! Didn't you write the script for Leyla years ago? This is none of your business. - Let's take a vote then. - OK. You'll see no one here will overrule my decision. Let's see. Who is voting for Leyla? But... I didn't buy these negatives from the producer Aziz. - Leyla bought them. - Leyla? Despite the fact that she knew she wasn't part of this film. You hired that women as an actress but she was... ...the first one leaving the boat but Leyla continued her support... ...even when she was not on board. - Aziz, Leyla deserves the role. - For the sake of Leyla. OK, you might be upset with her but thinking professionally... Leyla must be on the set. We'd better lift the camera higher, huh? Certainly, that's what I was thinking. Tatyos the camera, up. Aziz, don't... But Tatyos, no problem, okay, okay, let's do it from here. - Let me adjust. - OK. - Take it easy guys! - Thank you. Hey, Fikret, welcome. That means I'm not too old. You recognized me. - You are not. - How are you doing? Just like everyone else, cholesterol... ...high blood pressure, diabetes, want more? Welcome. Wow the great Cihat Alkan, even you got old. Not at all. He is still hale and hearty. He can outdo all of us, I swear. You didn't ask the reason for my visit. When are we beginning Aziz? Weren't you looking for an actor? Yes, we are but frankly speaking, we can't afford your wage. Did I mention money? You got together as old friends and are doing something... ...why can't I contribute too? Here are the costumes, wear the one that fits. - Let me fetch the tea. - Thanks. Aziz, find a reason and send him away. I won't play the role with that drunk. He is here to support us, how can I send him? Support, huh? No one else will hire this alcoholic. Come on... This man was a loser before I secluded myself. What is it? Is this a home for the destitute? - He is my friend. - This is not a kid's game. Is he a match for Cihat Alkan, can he carry me? Any recommendations? Remember, the person will work... ...free of charge and will also be capable of carrying you? The discussion is over. Concentrate on your part. - Fikret! - Aziz... Cihat is right. He made me see the truth. I'm finished. He is right. Don't talk nonsense. You know Cihat, he is an actor, he is jealous. I wish he were jealous. Then I would at least have a reason to believe that I count. The truth is no one wants me. They don't want to see me, even talk to me. My wife, even she took the children and left me. Let's accept that I'm a loser. If disappear... What the hell are you talking about? If I disappear nothing will change. The world will continue to turn, a drunk will disappear... ...and the world will get rid of me and I will get rid of myself. Fikret you know how fond I am of you. - Don't waste your breath, you know me, me... - But... I am set on this, you may say it was an accident. At least it may help to stop them gossiping behind me. - Fikret, stop, wait, I'll jump too. - What? How can I bear your loss. Don't you think I will jump after you? Don't be silly, don't be ridiculous. - Move aside, I'll jump first. - Are you crazy? You have no reason to die. You have a film to finish. You have a film to finish as well. Rehearsal! Stop it Tatyos, you shot me from my back again! Not my back but my face is celebrated. Look my friend, they give me the directions... ...then I get my camera and... ...shoot whoever or whatever is there. - Refer to Mr. Aziz. - Enough! Meddling with the film script, the actors, the camera. Are you an actor or superman? What's the big deal? I don't know how many times they shot me from the back too. They may shoot you but not me, never! You are so tense, take a sip... He is so precious. What's up? Pose-meter. Gne Karabuda gave it to me as a gift. It means a lot to me. - Ekrem! - What? Can you give a gift given to you to someone else? Is it proper? It depends. Who will you give the gift to? - To Hakan, for his favor. - Yeah, he deserves it. Thank him, without him, it would have been impossible... ...to persuade Tatyos. He was beaten for no real reason but didn't say a word. Yeah, anyway, let's lay down the rails. I can't sleep tonight. Stop whining. You always said that you were capable of doing everything... Where did they brew the tea? You are blood-brothers, you can give your lives for each other. But now you will kill each other because of me. Your feeling towards me is transient. On the other hand, your friendship is forever. It is best for me to walk away, somewhere you can't find me. But Zeynep... I can't let it happen. Don't make it worse, please, I made up my mind. Farewell... Stop, stop... Cihat, your cue, the carriage! Why are you here? To see me in such shape? Answer me why? Why are you here? Leyla, your cue! Even speaking to me is hard for you. I can't take it any more. You might frankly say you didn't want me on the set. - I didn't say that! - You just didn't put it into words. Are you aware of your behavior Aziz? The way you treat me? Am I obliged to put up with all of your behavior, am I? - Calm down Leyla! - I will not! We will clarify this matter. What is my crime? Even murderers are being pardoned after suffering their punishment. Isn't my punishment over yet? Besides, those who committed the same crime... ...who took part in the same films, were acquitted long time ago. Now they are living as respectable persons. But I'm... ...still a bitch, huh? Stop it Leyla, you are crossing the border. You all are crossing the border. All of you were implicated. Some of you were the cameraman of those films... ...some were light technicians, or set labors. If it was a shame or sin, we did it together. Why don't you share the responsibility with me? Or, dammit, why don't you forget those days? And you don't even let me forget those days! I know what crosses their minds when they stare at me: 'I saw her naked'. Yes, you did. You saw me naked but how come you forgot those days when... ...you were shouting 'take that off, take that off'... ...rushing out to those films? You made me play in those films. Now you are all immaculate. You are all double-dealers. Don't worry, I'll come to the set and finish the film. - It isn't the film, can we talk? - Talk what? If you let me... - Did you drink? - Yes, a bit. I've been thinking of what you said at length. I hadn't looked at things from that perspective before. Actually you were the victim. You didn't choose such a life. The producers forced you, first among whom... ...was that devil called Hakk. No, Aziz, no one deceived me. No, you have been deceived! They exploited. 'The innocent girl is deceived and exploited. ' Aziz, unfortunately this happens only in Turkish films. Life is totally different. I knew what I was in for. No, no, you are lying. You can't have acted on purpose. - They deceived you. - Stop it Aziz, enough. Now listen to the truth. There were two alternatives. The first was a humane life, the second was misery. Those who offered a humane life brutalized me... ...but it was hard to live in misery. Of course heroes always choose an honorable life... ...whatever the price. They don't sell out. But I wasn't the hero that you made me out to be Aziz. I was a coward. I didn't think that I could cope. That's why I chose the easy way out. And paid the price. No, no, this isn't the truth; you are deceiving yourself, no. This is the truth Aziz. I was not a hero as you thought but just an ordinary bitch. Stop, stop this, you were deceived. - No, I haven't! - Yes, you have been. No, open your eyes, here is the truth. This is the truth Aziz, this is me, look, look. Take them away from in front of my eyes... - You are a coward, look at these. - I said take them away. You are not going anywhere, you will see the truth. - You will look at them, look. - No, no, no! A lighter? Do you have a lighter? Thank you old-man. Won't you buy me a drink? I'm dehydrated. Hey son, bring a drink to this young lady please. Young lady? Hey, old-man how did you fall down here? - How old are you? - 18. Your real age? Hey old-man what are you gonna do with reality at this hour? It's time to dream now, to forget everything. How did you end up here? Why do you say so? I'm happy with my situation. I know your inner thoughts are different. Are they holding you by force here? By force? If it were so, I'd have smashed their heads. Did they make you sign a note? What the fucking note are you talking about old-man? - Just have fun. - You must be miserable. Just the contrary, I'm feeling great. You are not guilty. Those who caused your downfall are. - What guilt? - It's our guilt as a society. Stop, did you come here to nag; are we holding a panel discussion? - What's the matter? - Nothing! He is nuts. You can't keep these women here by force. You don't have right to do so. They are all innocent babies. Don't corrupt these women, don't take advantage of them. - Yes, please. - Who is it? - I hope you will recover soon. - Thank you. How are you? I hope there is nothing serious? Yeah, I've almost recovered. Just my arm, small bruises, I need to rest and that's it. I'm sorry. I wish it never happened. As for Leyla... - I swear I don't have any... - No, no, it isn't the way you think. I don't blame you anymore for this. I hope you'll get well soon. Because I never see you together recently. Accidentally. So, mine was a groundless fear. You know what; I admire your friendship. You are friends forever. Stop, stop, stop. Well done everybody. Bye. Thank you, thank you. - Thanks Tatyos. - No, thank you. Hey guys listen up. Handling a camera is my only skill. After so many years I am doing it again. Even though I'm not good at it... No, Tatyos, you're not a bad cameraman. No Aziz, I'm aware of everything. It was my fault. But... You tricked me to make me return to the sets again. But it does not matter any more. You hired me although you knew the truth. I could have messed up this film too... ...but you nevertheless trusted me. Now, I appreciate that. Man, you trapped another one, didn't you? Here he comes. - Welcome, I am Murat. - Nice to meet you. Murat was just about to leave, isn't that right Murat? - Yes, yes. Take it easy. - Thanks. We didn't offend your friend, did we? What offense? You smell great. - Why are you hurrying? - I missed you so much. Did you not, did you not miss me? Of course I did. - Come on, take that off. - Stop. - Take it off, take it off. - Wait a minute. You are very beautiful. You are very beautiful. What did Avni say? He has sold the movie theatre many years ago. Besides, we needed to take action months ago. All the movie theatres are booked till summer. One of them accepted to put it on show in the... ...summer for a couple of days. I could hardly make the men watch the film. 'The film is good but not in line with our concept. ' Big words! - What is it supposed to mean? - It wasn't their style. Fuck their style! Holding a gala is better than nothing. A gala? Wouldn't it be nice? The outsider Americans captured our own movie theatres. We can hardly organize a gala. We mustn't be foolish. The young folks' films are on show everywhere. The problem is with us. We all had the same dream. It's not possible for others to understand it. In other words, our epoch ended a long time ago guys... ...a very long time ago. I thought we were invited to the gala but what is this place? This place is a timber warehouse. - Did we come to the wrong place? - Are you asking? Of course we did, get back to the taxies. No, you are in the right place. Come on in, come on in, come on! You have such resolve Aziz, you did what you wanted to do. We! We did it together. Don't let the writing timber warehouse on the door confuses you. This place is former summer 'Smer Movie Theatre'. Congratulations Aziz, indeed, congratulations. You will hold the gala without the leading actor. I had told you that I was the fastest man to... ...pick up his jacket and walk away. I'd warned you! What's the matter Cihat, where are you going? You promised me, you said you will put my name on the top. Is it on the bottom? I put it on the top, you see? Not on the top, the very top! Come on Cihat, you see we three are on the same line. I've dedicated my life to cinema, I won't let anyone slight me. Nobody knows the film or the poster. There is no other film-poster except this one in entire stanbul. So what! He knows. This drunk will presume to be an actor, he will put on airs. Cihat, what about this? Here you go Cihat, your name is on the very top now. No problem, your name can be written on the very top. - Fikret? - I don't mind either. This was such a nice place when it used to be a movie theatre. At least we were seeing people here. Now all we see is timber. Then why did you close the movie theatre? Then who would look after my children? The boss converted this place to a timber warehouse... ...and now we can make a living. - Everyone is here. - Really? Everyone? Yes, everyone. Just let me finish this, I'll be with you right away. Be quick. Do you remember this place? How can I forget the place where I first kissed you? - Don't embarrass me. - They say history repeats itself. Excuse me? Let us not prove the historians wrong. - I can't do it. - Why Zeynep? Why? Don't ask why. I cannot. Why are you here? To see me in such shape? - Answer me why? - Just give me a few minutes... ...to correct some misunderstandings. Just a few minutes? I gave you all my life, all my life. I don't know. Because I never see you together recently. Accidentally, accidentally. I admire your friendship. You are friends forever. But our feelings are mutual. That's what you think. Did she accept your proposal? - She will. - You don't own Zeynep. I thought you were my friend. I've slit my wrist for nothing. Shame on you. Shame on you. For the sake of a woman... - Fuck you! - Shit! Why now? Couldn't wait for two more minutes... Don't worry, the electricity will be back soon. - What if it does not? - Don't worry, it will. Here is the guard coming. This is not your lucky day. - Did the fuse blow? - No sir, there is an outage. Didn't you hear the noise? The transformer blacked out again. So when will it be back? Actually it won't if they don't fix the transformer. - Not before 2- 3 hours. - 2-3 hours? We are going to freeze here. Don't watch the rest of the film. Didn't you shoot the film yourselves? You know how it will end, don't you? Hakan, do you have the gun with you? - Yes, I have. - Give it to Cihat. What? Pass me the torches, the torches, give them to me. Fikret, Cihat, Leyla to the stage. - Why? - Go to the stage, move. - What's going on? - Move, move... Please to the stage, quick, now, now. I didn't understand why we are doing this. Cemil, take the clarinet. - Tatyos, take them. - What? - Aren't you the cameraman? - Yes. Take then... Fikret change sides with Cihat. We will begin from the scene where the lights went out. - How? How will we play it here? - But... No objections. We will finish this film this way or that, got it? You will begin with the music, good... I warned you to stay away from Zeynep. - Tatyos, take Cihat in medium shot. - How? Zeynep doesn't belong to you. I love her too. Cihat medium shot... - But our feelings are mutual. - That's what you think. - Did she accept your proposal? - She will. I thought you were my friend. I've slit my wrist for nothing. - Fikret come closer. - Shame on you. Shame on you! You are holding your blood-brother at gunpoint because of a woman. Cihat medium shot. You are not my blood-brother anymore but my enemy. So don't stop, shoot me. Let my brother, blood-brother be my killer. Leyla. Stop this, for God's sake what are you doing? It's between us Zeynep. You stay out of this. Yes, this is none of your business Zeynep. You are lying. I heard what you said. You can't do this. You are blood-brothers, you can give your lives for each other. But now you will kill each other because of me. Your feeling towards me is transient. On the other hand, your friendship is forever. It is best for me to walk away, somewhere you can't find me. - But Zeynep... - I can't let it happen Zeynep. Don't make it worse, please. I made up my mind, farewell. Leyla! Don't go! I have things to say. Well, this stanbul, how can I say, is very stressful... ...crowded, the traffic you know... Hakan, come here son. But the town I'm coming from is like heaven. I mean if you want to live in a place with fresh air... Are trying to say, 'Come with me. '? - Something like that. - You are a master now. - What are we going to do there? - We'll find something to do. Be careful! We may cultivate the land, or I don't know... ...open a summer movie theatre... ...and put our film on show everyday. Be specific Aziz. What do you mean? What do you propose to me? Living together? Whatever you want. To marry? As I said whatever you want. Won't my past bother you? It won't. Are you sure? I must confess something. Remember, I was saying I was not going to die... ...before shooting this film. Actually it was a lie. I've shot this film repeatedly. At night, in my dreams... But I could not join you. Neither in dreams nor in daydreams. I came to stanbul not to shoot this film but only for you. You are a great guy Aziz. Everybody loves the Virgin Mary. STOP!
