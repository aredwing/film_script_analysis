I think it's them kids over at Luke's place. Now, why would they do something like that? [Thunder Crashes] [Loud Thump] That's not the storm. That's somethin' else. There's somethin' goin'on out there. I'm gonna check it out. What are you doin' here? That cornfield belongs to us. [Growls] [Choking] [Screaming] [Screaming] [Continues Screaming] [Footsteps] [Screaming] No! No! No! No! [Screaming Continues] ##[Up-Tempo Rock On Radio] Oh, Lazlo, that is so disgusting. What are you talking about? She is so fine! She takes care of me. Not like you. - You take care of me? - I'm just telling you! I take care of you! [Squealing] ##[Continues] Yeah! Look at her! Pointing the wrong way. Yeah? There we go. How's that? - Perfect. - No. I'm sorry, baby. It's... It's just not gonna work out between you and me. - You being vinyl, me being a man... - You're pathetic. - Flesh and blood. - Let's go. ##[Continues] [Man] Hey, Tyrus, you remember the man of the hour? - Got 'im right here. - Hey, buddy! Get it away from me! I don't want to look at that. Guys, don't spill Kurt in my car. - I don't want to look at that. - God, I'm sorry! - I just forgot you were the grieving widow. - Shut up! And we weren't married. We just talked about it sometimes. [Man 2] Well, Kurt talked about a lot of things. [Woman] Yeah, like what a jerk you are. Come on, you guys, cool it. We're the closest thing Kurt had to family, - so let's try and have a little respect for the dead. - Exactly. Hey, I think that's one of Lazlo's dolls. Hold on a second. [Honks Horn] Hey, maybe you shouldn't do that. Hell, no. This is the heartland of America, where people invite you into their homes... to talk about tornados, droughts, floods, Grandma's moonshine, shotgun weddings, they introduce you to their buxom, virginal daughters, and where... where people disappear. Charlotte? Charlotte? [Gasps] Hello? Lazlo? - [Growls] - [Gasps] [Whimpers, Screams] [Screaming] No! Charlotte! [Boy] Jared! Come here. - [Groaning] - What have you done? What if she's not alone? Did you ever think of that? Don't let him get back to the road. [Lazlo Whimpering] [Whimpering] That way. [Grunts] [Groaning] That doesn't look right. [Roars] Man! You took a wrong turn, man. You saw the doll. It was pointed this way. Well, you know what? You just should have stayed on the highway. Yeah? You got a problem with my driving? [Screaming] - [Tires Squealing] - [Screaming] [Man Groaning] Oh! - Is everybody okay? - Yeah, I think so. Ow! God! Great! This is good! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, you guys! Kurt's all over me! What the hell is that thing? It's one of Lazlo's dolls. You know what? We're gonna need a tow truck. Do you think so, Ty? You know, that'd be a great idea, if it wasn't so totally obvious! You know what? I do have a problem with your driving. - What's that? - The crashing part. - Crashing part. - You guys, you guys. Do you guys smell something funny... weird? - Did you... - [Sniffs] - What is that? - [Boy] It's none of your business. Hi. What's your name? Um, we had a little accident. You're on private property. Why don't you run along and give us a little privacy, then? - That's a joke, kid. - Shut up, Greg. - [Woman] Could we possibly use a phone? - [Boy] We don't have a phone. Well, h-how about a tractor, or something, you know, to pull us out? Town's about a mile that way. Thanks... for nothin', you little punk. Man, what the hell was that about? [Greg] I don't know. Those kids give me the creeps, though. All right, you guys, why don't we get our stuff out of the car... and see what's in town, okay? Ugh. Geez, you'd think there'd at least be a 7-11 at the end of the Earth. - I think I've found the spot. - Huh? - Kurt's favorite dive. - That must be the place. We can have final closure over a cold beer. ##[Country-Western] You guys, move. I have to wash up. Where are they? They left an hour before we did. I'm gonna go call Lazlo... and leave a message on his machine. Hey, buddy, you got any of that... Millwood Pale Ale? - Make it two. - Um, we had a little accident just outside of town. - Is there a tow truck service? - Nope. It's out of commission. It's over at Quad's Garage, gettin' a rebuild. Oh. Um, thanks. We're also looking for some friends in a convertible. They were supposed to meet us here. We don't get a whole lot of tourists in here. Oh, well, that's probably on account of your town's little hygiene problem. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - Greg, come on. Your town stinks. [Laughs] No, I'm... Seriously. I mean, there's a foul stench in the air. You can't smell it? I don't smell anything. - Yeah, it smells like burnt popcorn. - You must be talking about... the corn silo at Enright's place. Been burnin' that way for some time. You mean it's on fire? Spontaneous combustion. Gases build up, and then... boom. Fire like that can go on for months. Lucas Enright's kind of a queer duck. Keeps to himself, mostly. He's kind of like Howard Hughes, except without the money. Has a bunch of adopted kids workin' the farm for him. They're all religious fanatics. They worship some fella they call... He Who Walks Beyond the Clouds, or somethin'like that. Wait a minute. You mean, "He Who Walks Behind the Rows"? Yeah! That's it. What a nutty bunch of fruitcakes. What'd we miss? Nothing. Let's go. What's the rush? I haven't had a sip of my beer yet. Let's go. Alison, what's got into you? - Yeah, and where the hell are you going? - I'm going home. - What about Lazlo and Charlotte? - They were supposed to be ahead of us. - We're probably in the wrong place. - Evening, folks. You people look a little lost. No, we're not lost. Just stupid. We drove our car into a ditch just outside of town. Sorry. I can't help you there. Our tow truck is getting rebuilt. [Greg] Yeah. We heard all about it. We were supposed to meet some friends here, but they never showed. So what kind of a vehicle are they driving? - Uh, it's a blue Pontiac Bonneville. - No, I'm sorry. Haven't seen anything around here like that. Well, is there like a bus or something that we can take back into town? Yeah. Back at the, uh, highway junction. Twice a day... 8:00 a.m., 8:00 p.m. If you run, you can just about make it. Thanks. Thank you, sir. Oh! You guys, I'm in heels! [All] Wait! Wait! Come back! - Hey! - Now what? [Sighs] I don't know. I got some blankets and stuff back in the car. We can sleep there tonight. What about those kids? It'll be dark. They won't even know we're there. Oh, man. [Greg] Look... my car! That's my car! No! No! No, no, no! [Sobbing] No! It's not that great of a car, Greg. I'm freezing. I think I saw a house down the road. Maybe there's a phone we can use. Looks deserted. It's probably one of them farm repos, you know? Pretty soon, this whole place... is gonna be an industrial park. Hello! Anybody home? Nobody's here. I say we stay here for the night, catch the bus in the morning. Sold! This place hasn't been empty that long. Dead. Yeah, well, I'm hypogylcemic, and I need to eat something now. Well, got running water. Must be tapped into a spring. You guys won't believe it. The beds upstairs are fully made, with sheets and everything. Like a roadside inn, huh? - [Squeaking] - [Screaming] - [Moaning] - God! Are you okay? Oh, my God! That was disgusting! - Yeah, a roadside inn with giant rats. - Ugh! Well, we got pickles, beans, fruit cocktail... Ooh! With the little Maraschino cherries? God, I love those. What's that? Mmm! Smeat! Hey, guys, look what I found in the basement. It's even kind of cold. - [Greg] To Kurt. - [Bottles Clink] I guess we'll never know what went wrong. I don't understand. I thought bungee jumping was so safe. Yeah, but that was Kurt. He was a free spirit. Come on, Alison. Join the party. Have a beer. - No, thanks. - Come on! - You never know when your number's gonna be called. - I said no. It wasn't an accident. [Greg] Say what? [Tyrus] Sure it was. I mean, what, you think he was murdered? [Alison] When we were packing up his apartment, I found a suicide note. You're lying! Kurt would never do that! I got rid of the note before anyone saw it. I thought I was helping Kir. I was trying to protect you. Look, it doesn't matter. It was wrong of me and I'm really sorry. Kir, you okay? Hey, baby. It's okay. Come on. Lie back and try and get some rest. [Sighs] Can I get you anything? I'll be in the next room if you need... No, please. I don't want to be alone. [Door Opens, Footsteps] Look, Alison, I understand if you don't want to talk about it. You know, you can trust me. It's not that. It's about my brother. You never told me you had a brother. Our father was a drinker, and a mean drunk. When I got old enough, I moved out and I never looked back. My dad got even worse, and Jacob took the brunt of it. Finally ran away from home. He was barely 14. I had no idea. I'm so sorry. The last thing he told me before he left... was that he was devoting his life... to He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Do you think he's with those kids? When I heard that, my first impulse was just to get the hell out of here, to get as far away as possible. He's your brother. Don't you want to see him? Jacob doesn't want anything to do with me. Thinks I've abandoned him. And you know what? He's probably right. [Owls Hooting, Animals Screeching] [Footsteps] [Labored Breathing] [Rattling] [Gasps] [Rattling Continues] - [Rattling] - [Gasps] [Rattling] [Screaming] - What is it? What happened? - Oh, my God! There was a man at the window! I'm gonna get Greg. You stay here. Hey. This mud is still wet. - [Ignition, Engine Starting] - What the hell was that? I don't know. Alison! What are you doing? [Heavy Machinery Running] [Machinery Continues] [Machinery Stops] [Sharp Hiss] What is this thing? Oh, my God! - It's blood! - What? [Screaming] Oh, my God! It's Charlotte! [Greg] And Lazlo! [Man] Sheriff, look! - Got a little bit more. - What the hell is that? I think it's a foot, sir. Well, I'll be damned. There's the big toe right there. Matches the one in there... I think. Look, Officer, we just needed a place to stay. - We didn't have anyplace else to go. - Did I say you could talk? - No, sir. I thought I should explain... - Then shut up. - You people were out drinking last night? - No! We weren't. - We just had a couple of beers. - Couple of beers? Found that out by the harvester. You-You don't think that we had anything to do with this? My God! They were our friends! You got no business messing around with that heavy equipment. It's dangerous as hell. You're lucky all of you didn't get killed. One more thing. I want you on that 8:00 a.m. Bus out of here. You got it? [Alison] Got it. [Door Closes, Car Starts] Alison, come on. Let's get the hell out of Dodge. We're right behind you. I'm staying. I have to find out. This is about your brother, isn't it? - Well, we gotta stick together. - No way. - Come on, man. We can't let her go out there by herself. - No way. You got no proof your brother's out there. You're just gonna have to drag my dead body by my little toes... before I ever, ever, ever... "Stick together." You know what? When these wack-jobs stick our dead bodies... in a mass grave, then we'll be stuck together. Did you hear that? You know they're watching us. [Tyrus] They could be cannibals for all we know. Yeah, well, maybe you should join them. Then you could eat me. Hey. Check out the welcoming committee. You're on private property. Well, I want to talk to my brotherJacob. Alison? [Sighs] He doesn't want to see you. Do I have to get the police? That won't be necessary. This way. [Hammers Pounding] [Rooster Crows] The rest of you stay here. We all stick together. You gonna be all right? I'll be fine. Wait here. Oh, uh, yeah. I should go, uh, milk a cow or something. Kir, about last night. What about it? I just want to let you know that I care a lot about you, and it wasn't just a one-night stand for me. I'm sorry, Ty, but that's all it was for me. [Whispering] The outsiders call me a monster... a molester, a lunatic. But I am none of these things. I am a prophet. I am the savior... of these children. Saving them from what? Years ago, it was, I was working in the fields... and I came upon an infant child... who had been left there... to die among the corn rows. I took him home. I raised him as my own. About that time, the eternal flame... sparked to life, acting as a beacon... to all those forgotten children... who had been abused and neglected... by their so-called parents. I gave them love, I gave them family, and I gave them purpose. Now they have the chance to serve... a higher order... to worship... He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Yet, you have come here to threaten the harmony we have established. I just want to see my brother. I understand your concern. Our ways must seem strange to you. But you must acknowledge... When your brother first came to us, he was very depressed... suicidal, actually. And under my tutelage, he has flourished and blossomed, like the proverbial spring flower. Well, then you shouldn't fear my talking with him. [Whispering] Yes. Of course. We have no secrets here. Ezekiel will show you to him. [Clock Chimes] You are dismissed. [Chain Rattling] [Rattling] [Gasps] Hey, stretch. Uh, just looking for a place to take a leak, you know? - Uh, you know what? I'm just gonna go. - Go. That's what I said. - I'm gonna go now. - Now. Now. It's a... It's a great idea. Just gonna go this way. Nice ax. - Hi. - Hi. - What's your name? - Kir. I'm Zane. Forgive me for-for-for being forward, What? What is it? It's just that since I first saw you... I could tell that you were hurting. I got the feeling that you were in a lot of pain. Somebody really close to me died recently. I'm not trying to make any judgments about you, but I know how you feel. I was there myself not too long ago. [Sobbing] Kir, there is good in this world. It's not all terrible. I found some of that good right here on this farm. You see, we all start with a heart that's pure... and joyful. And sometimes we lose that along the way. But it can be found again, if only you'll let He Who Walks Behind the Rows... show you the way. [Sniffs, Sighs] I have to get back to my friends. Okay. - Jacob? - Alison. I can't believe it's really you. - How did you find me? - I'm not sure. A lot of luck and a little intuition, I guess. Do you mind? I'd like a few moments alone. I'll wait outside. [Door Closes] - Happy birthday. - Not till tomorrow. I know. I just... Dad passed away a few months ago. That was inevitable, wasn't it? Jacob, I know it wasn't easy for you. - You left me alone with him. - And I'm so sorry. Please give me a chance to make it up to you. Come home with me. This is my home. This is my family. I have a wife now. Luke chose her to bear my child. He chose her? Do you love her? Of course. Uh, what kind of a question is that? Why is everyone so young here? Children are still pure of heart and mind. They have not yet been corrupted by the ways of the outsiders. After your 18th birthday and you become an adult, enter the age of sin. For you that's tomorrow. Yes, it is. What about Luke? He's an adult; does that make him evil? Luke is... different. Jacob, do you want to stay here? [Door Opens] You must leave now. [Whispers] Jacob. Wait. L-I want you to have this book. [Flipping Pages] This will help you understand. [Door Opens, Closes] [Rooster Crows] - What the hell happened in there? - I'm not sure. What, so that's it? Alison. Hey! Did you even see your brother? - [Sighs] - Alison? Did you read what your brother wrote? No. "He Who Walks Behind the Rows, Earth our only father..." Hey! Let's see here. Hey, look! A recipe... for cyanide fruit punch. I was reading the book and it makes a lot of sense, you guys. Like what? Basically it says children are born into this world free of sin and completely pure. And being raised by adults, well, that's when they become... you know, when they become tainted. Tainted. Evil. You're losin' it, Kir. What do you think, Al? There's probably a lot of truth in it. That's what makes it so dangerous. Yeah, well, two of our friends died last night, and I'm not stickin' around to see history repeat itself. So who's comin' with me? Kir? You comin'or not? Yeah, I guess. [Sighs] Come on, you guys. What happened to our, like, musketeer thing we had goin'? - You know, all for one, one for all? - Look, we were all there to support her and she came home empty-handed. Ain't my problem anymore. What are you going to do? Don't worry about me. I'll figure something out. "On the eve of thine 18th journey, around the blazing star that gave birth to all life in Creation, ye shall be returned to the earth and embraced by He Who Walks Behind the Rows. [Footsteps] He Who Walks Behind the Rows, Earth our only father, let him into your heart to purge the demons of gluttony and avarice." Oh, my God. Thought I told you to be on that bus. [Tyrus] You got a thing for her, don't you? Well, what's your excuse? I guess I have nobody to go home to. [Sighs] - You coming? - I'll wait out here. Hey, Alison. Alison, are you here? Kir? Hey, Kir, where are you? Kir? - [Shouting] Kir! - Calm down, Ty. - It's those goddamn kids! - Just relax, all right? - They're gone, Greg. - Don't jump to conclusions. First it was Alison, now it's Kir. Where else could they be? We worship thine eminence on this special day, for today is Jacob's day. Jacob, ye shall ascend the ladder and leap forth into the eternal flame, and become one with He Who Walks Behind the Rows. From thine ashes a new crop shall be born among us. - I can't. - Jacob, it is the way of He Who Walks Behind the Rows. I know, but I can't. I won't. You must. You said I was free to leave whenever I wanted to. And you are. But who will you go to in the decaying, wretched world of the outsiders? Your sister that betrayed you? Lilly, come with me. We can raise our own family. We don't need them. This is my family, Jacob. Now that we have been betrayed byJacob, we must not disappoint He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Who among us will next be 18 years old? I will. Why do you come here, outsider? I've read the book, and for the first time in my life I know my purpose. - What is your purpose? - To reject the world of the aged... before I reach the age of sin, and to join He Who Walks Behind the Rows... because Kurt is waiting there for me. Come with us, beautiful child, for today shall be your day. [Panting] [Grunting] [Door Opens] You've challenged my authority and committed heresy against Him. That kind of insubordination will not be tolerated! [Screams, Groans] Now your sole purpose is to scare away the birds... and other vermin that violate our cornfields. [Moaning] The outsiders are coming! I'll be there in a minute. Put him in the cornfield. Be sure to cut his throat... so that his screams can't be heard. [Groans] [Grunts] [Siren Blares] [Horn Honks] - Stay close to me at all times, you understand? - Yeah. [Siren Blares] Sheriff's department. Got a warrant to search these premises. You have no right to be here. - Where's your warrant? - Right here, kid, to be delivered to Luke Enright. - Get out of my way. - No! I've been wanting to nail your ass for a long time, Luke. [Luke] If you try to extinguish that flame, your men will be punished with a vengeance such as His fury... hath not wrought before. You threatening me, Luke? I am tryin' to save you. [Screaming] - Jesus! - [Screaming Continues] [Screams] Why don't you step into the light where I can see you? [Whispering] I warn you, Sheriff. You're under arrest for threatening an officer. Don't do this. [Moans] [Moaning Continues] It is out of my hands now. [Panting, Growling] [Panting, Groaning] What the... [Screams] [Continues Screaming] Don't feel bad for Luke. He's been dead for years. You did this! We all have a few skeletons left in the closet, Alison. Fortunately, I was able to put mine to good use, as our leader. - [Explosion] - [Gasps] [Footsteps Running] [Grunts] You okay? Come on. - There's no keys. Where's Kir? - I thought she was with you! - [Shouting] - Behind you! Oh, God! Hurry up! I got 'em! I got 'em! [Shouting] - Where'd they go? - Come on! Come on! - [Groans] - Get up! Come on! - I hurt my ankle. - Get up! Oh, my God! - I think I can run. - Let's go! Go! [Panting] I think we lost 'em. [Panting] Oh, my God, it's Jacob! I'll stay here with him. You make sure all the doors are locked. Jacob. [Sobbing] This is all my fault. No. I remember... all those times... you protected me from Dad. You were just a kid too. I thought when I came here... I could begin again, you know? I didn't want to be like him. Now I'm gonna be a father. But you didn't know about Ezekiel and all the killings, did you? There's still time to stop him. How? Fight fire with fire. In the storage shed there's... [Gasping] I love you. [Sobbing] I love you too. [Weeping] Greg! Charlotte's car. This is our ticket out of here. - Oh... - [Ignition Cranks] Oh, sh... God! Okay. [Grunts] Let's see here. [Greg] All right, try it again. [Ignition Cranks] - Aw, come on, come on! - [Ignition Cranks] Aw, shoot! Oh, man. I could probably jury-rig somethin' but it's gonna take a little while. Fertilizer. [Banging, Wood Splintering] Wait! I thought I heard something. [Banging Continues] [Grunting] - [Grunting] - [Gasping] [Screaming] Help! Help! - [Motor Revving] - Alison, move! [Screaming] - [Moaning] - Are you okay? [Yelling] [Screams] [Motor Revs] [Motor Revs] [Gasping] [Screams] - [Screams] - [Grunts] [Motor Revs] [Screams] [Screaming] [Panting] [Footsteps Approaching] Ty? [Footsteps Continue] Hey, hey! [Gasps] [Whimpers] - [Drill Whirring] - Can't we talk about this? [Giggles] [Whimpers] - [Sizzling] - [Groaning] [Screams] I got your eternal flame right here! [Screams] [Panting] Fight fire... with fire. Our family has been torn asunder. Our brethren lie broken... and bleeding all around us. Before the last few innocent souls on Earth have been annihilated, we shall escape... and join He Who Walks Behind the Rows in a better place. Now, follow me, children. [Panting] [Screams] [Screams] [Grunts] [Screams] [Gasping] Did Ezekiel join He Who Walks Behind the Rows? I don't know. He just might have. Will we get to go there? I don't think it's your time yet. [Doorbell Chimes] - Hi. - You must be Alison. - Please, come in. - Thank you. [Baby Cooing] Lilly's really not equipped to be a mother. After all, she's only a child herself. She has her whole life ahead of her. It really wouldn't be fair to her... or the baby. I know it's the right thing for him. It's whatJacob would have wanted. I'll take good care of him, I promise. Thank you. Well, why don't we all go and let you two get to know one another. Lilly. Lilly? [Whispering] Hey, sweetie. Hey, you. # Hush, little baby Don't say a word # # Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird # #And if that mockingbird don't sing # # Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring # # If that diamond ring turns brass # #Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass ##
