Welcome to my new hospital. Yeah, it's very new. We're still settling in. They haven't woken up yet? Not a single one. They don't even move in their sleep. How is your leg? Didn't you use my herbal cream? I did. But it wasn't absorbed into my bones. Really? Show me what you use. The cream I gave you is a good one. What did you use? - Here. - What is it? This is my new collection. Aren't they pretty? So diligent. You haven't stopped knitting? I always see you knitting. The patterns are very Japanese. Take a look. Colourful Japanese baby socks. But we have only sleeping soldiers here. Who will be our customers? We can try with the female relatives. They might buy them for their kids. They are only villagers. It's not the same as before. Maybe I can make socks for these guys. You can try that. I miss this school a lot. Back then... I sat there... Where that guy is sleeping. The blackboard was too far for me to read properly... Keng, how are you? - Need any help? - I'm OK. I often looked out of the window. At the jackfruit tree. The mango tree... My English teacher liked to sit under that jackfruit tree. He wore dark-rimmed glasses... Handsome as Clark Kent in Superman. - That handsome? - Yes. The soldiers just sleep... The army doesn't know what to do with them. They took up too much space at the hospital. Will he wake up? Not easily. Jen, see that young woman? - Which one? - By that bed. She's very talented for her age. She normally works for the police. She helps contact the spirits of murder victims. Or missing-persons. She was approached by the FBI. - Really? - Yes. They offered her a house, a car, and a big salary. - But she declined. - Why? She told them, "I only serve my country." That's so admirable. Excuse me... Don't go anywhere. Dr. Prasan! Excuse me, doctor! Dr. Prasan! You forgot to sign the prescription. - From this morning? - Yes. He is walking about somewhere. He's confused. It's a dark night. But he can still see. There's a mound of dirt. Concrete pillars. He has a pen and is writing something down. His friends are watching him. Male or female friends? Both. Is he happy? What would he like to eat? Minced meat and a bamboo shoot soup. Minced meat and a bamboo shoot soup? How spicy? Three chillies is enough. And a coke, too. With ice? You make me miss the old hospital. This place is just as nice. - You'll soon forget the old one. - Yes. Keep an eye on him for me. How are you, Auntie? - It's hot today, right? - Yes. The day will pass quickly. Did you go to the concert last night? I went. But I didn't stay long. Let me check on the other soldiers. OK, let his head down. Attach this tube to his nose. - Like this? - Yes, and press this button. This machine works very well. They used it with American soldiers in Afghanistan. - They also have nightmares? - Yes. - I'd like to try one at home. - Good. Will it stop the snoring? Yes, it will help them sleep with good dreams. - Should I turn it on? - Yes. Should we close the windows? Let's close them. Doctor, please give me a hand. Close them please. Looks like funeral lights. Yes, I felt so too. Hi. Need a hand? I can manage. Are your noodles tasty? Yes. Want to try some? No, thank you. I'm on a diet. But those fried bananas are loaded with calories. They reuse the oil, maybe thousands of times. It's just a snack. At home, I eat very healthily. Normally, I don't sleep very well. I get three or four hours sleep at best. Since coming here, I'm sleeping much better. It's as if I'm synchronising with that soldier. Or maybe he's sleeping for me. Do you know a drug called Melatonin? It's good for older women. Yeah? Then it's definitely not for me. I'm kidding. This small town can bore you to death. At least, there are the sleeping soldiers to make things more exciting. You're lucky, then. I'm quite tired of talking to them. Their relatives always ask me for lottery numbers. As if I can see the future. You can't? Can you teach me your trick? I don't know how. I've had this gift since I was young. Out of the blue, I could recall my past life as a boy. I fell from a tree and died. Wow! - You saw it that clearly? - Yes. The good thing for me here is that I get free medicines to take home. Sister, can I borrow some money? I have to pay for my mortgage. - Are you serious? - If you don't mind. Sure. If you can cure my lame leg. Make my right leg as long as the left. Can you? I'm a psychic. I can only read minds. Help me finish the bananas. But you are an FBI agent, aren't you? - Is it moving? - Yes. Have you been eating raw or pickled fish or meat? - Yes, they are my favourite dishes. - I thought so. With the village headman? Yesterday, we had a celebration. - Do I have a parasite? - Yes, you have worms. Let me take another look. There. Can you feel it? Can you remove it? I only have kids' stuff here. I'll transfer you to a real hospital. Isn't this a real hospital? Yes, but it's a small one. We don't have much equipment. Give this to the nurse. And take more vitamins. You're too thin. Thank you, Doctor. Uncle, it's your turn. - Hello, Doctor. - Hello. How are you feeling? I lost my appetite and I can't sleep. - Are you stressed out? - Not really. Worried about the Agricultural Bank loan? Maybe that's part of it. But my body just won't sleep. - How so? - I feel tired but I can't sleep. We're expanding the kitchen. What colour do you want? Brown. Brown? Would you like floor tiles? He doesn't know what they are. How can he not? In the olden days, the kitchen was outside. I heard he has a mistress. Tell me where he's hiding her. I'm seeing his past life now. Why? Please focus on the present. He's sitting somewhere. There is someone with him. Who is it? I can't see clearly. I want to know. Try to focus, please. Our problem is that we think too much. All day, and all night... At night, we call it dreaming... We all dream. We can't stop them. Thoughts are the same. Since we can't stop them, we must become more aware. Aware of our thoughts, and of our dreams. [The sea can be violent or still with no pattern...] [My family is very ordinary...] Heaven and hell, merit and sin are all suppositions. Don't put too much faith in them. Meditation trains your mind. The visions we see are caused by chemical reactions in our brain. [Everyone has his own karma.] [I pleaded to the gods for my next life.] [Life is like candlelight.] When you sleep, your mind is still active. [When he sees his nephew, he always asks why he's so thin.] ["Don't you buy him milk?"] [They held hands...] [He was the youngest one...] Anyone can achieve awareness if they train their mind. [HELLO] Let's do a simple exercise. Don't think too much about it. Sit up straight. And slowly close your eyes. Focus on your upper body and your brain. Pull your thoughts down into your body. All the way down to your feet. Focus on your face now. What does it look like? Look at yourself. Your eyebrows. Your eyes. Try to imagine them. What are your ears like? Focus on your mouth. And now your chin. Slowly move your focus up. To the tip of your nose. Let it spread out. Away from your body. Until it fills the entire room. Move this ball of energy to the field outside. Once it's outside, let it expand. Let it float into the sky. Until it reaches the moon. From the moon, let it spread to the stars. It's spread to all the stars now. Now pull that energy back. Slowly pull it back into yourself. If your stomach hurts, let the energy flow to your stomach. Let it heal you. If you have cancer, hypertension, diabetes or AIDS, let this energy come in and heal you. Until you feel better. Once you feel better, gather the energy to the back of your neck. Let it collect there. Once it's gathered then... I'm a volunteer... I heard that you had no relatives. I know... I could hear you in my sleep. So you already know me, then. Sorry. I'm sorry... I... a lot. What? I'm sorry that I peed a lot. I can't move. Move what? My arm. I'm going to let go. Try it again. Higher. You should get up before you fall asleep again. Let me help you. OK? What is it? Slowly, or your head will spin. Let's sit here. Have you seen my phone charger? I don't know. I want to contact my family. I saved the number in my phone. But I can't find the charger. Are you from the south? Does my accent give me away? You have darker skin. But with a strange accent. My mom is from the west. Can you speak Southern Thai? How can you speak it? It's a talent I have. How's my lsan dialect? How's my lsan dialect? How's my lsan dialect? Keep eating the local chilli paste and your accent will improve. Tasty food, right? Yes it is. Honey! It's not your bedtime yet. Today, I present you with my best offerings. You'll like them. May my family possess good health and happiness. May I retain my beauty with no wrinkles. May ltt, my new son, wake up again. Honey, help me please. This is the cheetah, to help strengthen my leg. And this... It's a gibbon. I don't know the english name. It's to make your hand strong. Oh, good! Thank you. And this tiger. It's for our new son to be stronger. We have a new son? Yes, his name ltt. I told you. I see. Yeah, he's a good man. He serve the nation. You are foreigner. You won't get it, honey. No, no, I do understand. I know you're very patriotic. - Please. - OK. Be careful, huh. Your sense of colour is really nice. The housewives will love the pink and fluorescent green. They have good taste around here. Why don't you do the car-boot sale everyday? Just weekends is enough for me. The library doesn't look busy, but there's a lot to do. It's also hard to compete for a space at the market. - Have a seat. - OK. Thanks so much for these longkongs. You're welcome. They're from my orchard. I have a lot of longkong trees. And I don't use pesticides. Your house must be very big to have an orchard. Do you want to visit? You don't mind? How about today? Maybe some other time. So that I can bring my camera, too. Up to you. Did you read the latest volume of "Satan's Love"? - It just arrived. - Really? Which shelf is it on? Wait here. I've been away from home for a long time. Where's your home? Very far away. I really miss it. - Care to join me? - OK. Do you want some? They look good. Where did you get them? A man gave them to me. They're called longkongs. Mind if I taste? It's so sweet, sister. The very nectar of temptation. Please have some more. (Ma)' I 10in you? Who is this, I wonder? Look at these. - What do you think? - They're beautiful. So many beautiful clothes. Pretty and colourful. Don't you think? Feel the cloth. They're nice. But they're not my style. I think I'll pass. Besides I have to save money. Sister, these are for us... My sister got them from the market. You two know each other? Help yourself to some fruit. Thank you. We'd like to thank you for the miniature animal offerings. Pardon? They are really lovely, especially the gibbon. What do you mean? The mini animals that you gave us the other day. Weren't they from you? - From me? - Yes. You offered them at our shrine... by the lake. You're crazy. We're the princesses from the shrine. We don't usually appear in normal street wear like today... If you see us with make-up, in our traditional clothes, we are identical to the statues at the shrine. I beg your mercy, your Royal Highnesses. Stop it. Those royal words make us itchy. Thank you for bringing me happiness. Thank you for bringing Richard Widner from America. Where is he today? He's in town extending his visa... Want to visit my house and try my herbal tea? Maybe another day. Today, we came to tell you that those soldiers will never recover. At the old school? Yes, there used to be a palace there. A war broke out between the kingdoms thousands of years ago. Bodies of dead villagers and soldiers laid everywhere. But most importantly, the cemetery of the kings was located beneath your elementary school. Let me explain. The spirits of the dead kings are drawing on the soldiers' energy to fight their battles. They are still fighting as we speak. How can that be? I thought their spirits had already passed away. Both of us are dead as well. You can apply the medicinal balm now. The soldiers are sleeping better. And having fewer nightmares. It must be these machines, or the coloured lights. Or maybe the meditation is working. Keng, are you done? Yesterday, something happened. The goddesses from Laos appeared before me. They said we are standing on top of the cemetery of the kings. What? This school was a cemetery? - The goddesses from the lake shrine? - Yes. They also said that the spirits of the dead kings are using these men's spirits for their battles. Is that so? Perhaps the soldiers were their troops in the past. So the kings have put the sleeping soldiers to good use? Were the goddesses beautiful, sister? Yes, even without make-up their skin is flawless. It must be their magic power, since they are hundreds of years old. They looked younger than me. You have to be dead. That's their secret. So that's why, when I was a student here... I always felt sleepy. So we will be here for a long time, then. Until the fibre optic cable company kicks everyone out. I'm happy to know that at least he's doing some good in his sleep. Are you serious? Look... He's waking up. See? Do you want to try to touch it, Jen? It's OK. I've touched way too many penises in my life. May I? How amazing. HELLO Hello. Hello. I'm with Poy. Why? He's just a friend. Can we go and see you? He asked if we can go and see you. Does he have cute friends? Do you have cute friends? He says he has lots. We'll go and see you, OK? Do you want fried mussel pancake? No, I haven't finished this dish yet. Can you smell the dipping sauce? The smell is very sharp to me. Soy sauce and sugar. What does sugar smell like? I can separate all the smells in this market... Really? I can feel the temperatures of the lights. You're like Superman. It's true. I can smell the flowers in my dreams, too. Yeah? That's an important quality for a good soldier. How about your husband? He's a soldier, like you... But not from your unit. He's from America. Congratulations! Well, I don't know. My English is not good... We met online. I could type and look at the dictionary. There was time. But now, I don't understand all that he says. You should drink lots of coffee. Will you go to the States? He sold everything there. He won't go back. Wow, sounds serious. It's funny. He took several long flights to get here. Maybe he's on a wanted list there. Maybe he's a terrorist. Watch your mouth! I checked with the embassy. Does he miss home? I don't think so. Why? He's quiet and likes to be alone. He doesn't like the night life. Doesn't he get lonely? Who does he talk to? He has me to talk to. Are you full? Do you want some custard? Does he look like his online picture? Well, he's a little fatter. How fat? Around this fat. If he's that fat, he must be a high ranking soldier. But he's been retired for a while. Isn't it too hot for him here? Will you stop? Amongst humans, the most brilliant are those who are disciplined. Honey? I'm the only one who's awake here. I just remember a homework... I forgot send to the teacher long years ago. And also strange animal in the lake. To this day, I don't know what it was. In the water it was weightless... and calm. It's now floating in my head... in my heart. I... I'm glad you're up early today, little pup. Me too. I'm a simple woman. I like to eat street food like this. But if I'm with Richard, we have to watch his cholesterol. What can't he eat? Sticky rice, pork, not even Pepsi... ls Pepsi high in cholesterol? Guess so. And pig's entrails. All intestines. (Hey, b0)'- Come here. Go away! You're too kind. It's just hungry like us. I want to quit the army. What are you going to do? I'm good at many things. What are they? I want to sell moon cakes. I make tasty ones. Taiwanese style. What is Taiwanese style like? Soft with a lot of egg whites. A thin crust and a lot of green bean filling. I can sell them at gas stations in lsan. That involves quite an investment. I see no future in being a soldier. I mainly wash cars for the generals. Welcome everyone. Ladies, gentlemen and children. My name is Jeed. I'm sure you recognise me from TV. I look just like Leena Jung. On TV and the radio. And now I'm here in the flesh. I'm very happy to be here today. I want to show you an unbelievable product. It seems impossible. But look at this. This is a piece of rubber. We can grow rubber in Thailand. What's amazing about this is that it's made from rubber but we can use it for our skin. Another thing is that it can rid us housewives of the loneliness in our lives. Most of you are housewives. - Not this woman though. - That's right. - What do you do? - I work at City Hall. A city official here in uniform. Thanks for skipping work to see me. Please give her a big hand. Thank you. We have members nationwide. I've travelled around the country. Khon Kaen women are so gorgeous. Do I look like I'm from lsan? I don't look it, right? Because I'm too beautiful to be from lsan? Every woman has beauty inside. I'm from Buriram Province. So I understand how lsan people feel. How they want to look. We have an emotional bond. What do I mean? It means we can understand each other. This cream is certified by Chulalongkorn University. I'm not making it up. And now, what you've been waiting for. You get to try this special cream. My assistants will hand out samples. Please come up here. Numbers 1 to 10. Numbers 11 to 30. If you didn't register, don't worry. There's enough for everyone. Give me your hand. I'll apply it for you. Feels cool, right? Do you usually use hand cream? Try this. You only have to apply it once a day. Just once a day. Other creams you have to re-apply. Keng, is that you? I'm so happy to see you here! I saw you walking over. Really? Why are you here? To give you this gift, of course. - How nice. - Open it. - Is this a legitimate product? - Of course. You're here as a police spy, aren't you? Don't tell anyone. But you have to try it, sister. Your skin will glow. This cream is for your face. But you can use it on your body. So you buy more. For a man, his skin is very smooth. Because he uses this cream. What did you use before? Generic stuff. Why did you switch to this one? Because it works. You let me try it for free. So I tried it out, and it worked. What's wrong? The smell. It smells like that fluid. What fluid? That stuff people call cum. How could you think of that? Take a sniff. - It smells like this? - Yes. Oh, I can breathe easier. See? That's its power. My boobs are perking up. Don't tease me! But, it's true. Read this. The weather is perfect for a nap. Let's have our daily session. We have bigger sets too. I can give you a discount. Let me finish this set first. He's asking me if you want to see. See what? What he's seeing. How can I see? Through my body. If so, then... This would be an amazing afternoon. Goodbye, sister. Hello. N'? I'm trying to believe that it's you. Yes, I'm m. I'm standing in the throne hall. Is there anybody else with you? Come with me. Follow me. Where are we going? The ceiling here is not that high. It can be quite suffocating. Duck your head. I don't think I'll hit it. You must come here often when you sleep. What is it? It's the threshold. Step over it. Like this? That's right. We have reached the Grand Hall. It's so lavish. There are many other rooms. These are our orchids. The senior citizens club organised them. We each grew one and took care of it. Something to keep us occupied. Here, this is my orchid. See? My name is on the sign. When it blooms, we use the bag to protect it from insects. Let me help. You can have it. The bag'? The flower, silly. It's not doing so well. I haven't been back for awhile. Let it breathe a little bit. Let's go. Itt, look at those figs. We should dip them in chilli sauce. Here. The flood marks from a few years ago. The water came up to here. Over here. This is a prince's dressing room. It's full of mirrors. Why do they need so many mirrors? Palace intrigue, I guess. To see people sneaking up on them. Can you see me? Yes, from head to toe. How about here? Let's go. This is the golden bathroom. The sink is made from Burmese jade. So this was a royal bathroom? This is the foot basin. It's made of pink stone. Have you seen pink stone before? This is the first time in my life. Everything looks so luxurious. Bend down. We're next to the bed. Its four legs are carved like crocodile feet. I remember this place. Come here, ltt. Another leg. Wait... We're entering the music room. The mayor planned this place to showcase the northeast region. But then the floods came. A tycoon the size of an ant is always noticed. But a pauper as large as a mountain is completely ignored. Hunger for heaven will lead you to hell. Time left unused... is the longest time. When we offend someone, we want to be forgiven. But when we are offended, we forget how to forgive. Come take a look. This is like when I was young in Nong Khai. Bombs were flying in from Laos. I can remember the siren. M, come here. Isn't it profound? I used to come here often, when I was confused. What were you confused about? Mostly about love. Are you still confused? You should know, my little pup. They outdid my palace decor. But I prefer your palace. Comfortable? Beflen You know my first husband was also a soldier? His name was Narong, Corporal Narong Jansuda. When I was twenty, I eloped with him. A monster... You're a soldier magnet! And one without borders. But I'd prefer a European husband. Americans are too poor. Europeans are living the American dream. The breath of love that never fades Not lonesome am I, my dear Though the many years that pass by My heart is still full of love Those days... alone... you and me... Every night from now The stars shine in our favour forever Heaven was created for us to meet Heaven is destroyed for us if we part But freedom is in my body While destiny fills my heart The heaven inside my heart Through summer and spring with you The memory of winter I miss you... you who were here... The breath of love that never fades Not lonesome am I, my dear Though the many years that pass by My heart is still full of love This is my favourite song, ltt. - What is it? - Something in your eye. I think I'm dreaming, ltt. I just want to wake up. Then just open your eyes wide. Like this. Wider. Very good. Jen... Of all the places we've been, this is by far the most opulent. But devoid of decoration. Not even gold? No! From here you can see the most fertile lands. Fields full of rice and rivers full of fish. It looks lonely. I see everything clearly now, ltt. Yes? At the heart of the kingdom, other than rice fields, there is nothing. You will live long, ltt. Our metabolism slows while we sleep. Save yourself for a better future. Where are you now, m'? Underground or here? Both, I guess. Look at this. Does it look scary to you? I don't think so. There's more. - Does it hurt here? - Not really. How about here? No, only with certain movements. The surgery costs 100,000 Baht per centimetre. My right leg is 10 cm shorter than the left. Just shorten the other leg then. I knew you'd say that. See? I can read your mind. Here, Jen. I can sense every smell here. Really? What next? "I can feel the temperature of the lights." I can feel the temperature of the lights. Then you must be Superman. "And the flower in my dream." I could really smell the flower in my dream. This is Richard's. For his brain, to fight Alzheimer's and arthritis. This is goji berry. Ginkgo biloba. Mix them together. Richard used to break dishes a lot. They'd slip from his hands. After drinking this, he doesn't drop things anymore. It helps me stay awake. You won't fall asleep again. Try it. What if I wake at the pavilion and go back home, will you be OK with that? Sure. You know, when you're asleep, even the bright city lights feel dull. No one has said that to me before. Drink it. No, thanks. What are you doing? What are you doing? It's therapy. Can you sense the energy? It tickles. Why are you pouring it out? Trust me. Stop it! It's full of germs. You're like a little puppy. Jen... Jen. Jen... Tell me what you see. Where are you? What? I'm not sure. Suddenly, I can read your mind. I have seen your dream. And I have seen yours. Don't fall asleep yet, please. Do you know what they're digging for? It's a secret government project. It's so secret, that they're digging out in the open. Soon, they will move us away. I'd prefer to sleep here. You're right. This is a good place to sleep. There's a mountain of bricks. It spreads out like a flower blossom. It stretches to the sky. To devour the sun. It is very far away. It looks ominous and fearsome. It pretends to be... a pure and flawless being. Pretends to be as soft as a child's palm. Before it disappears, the wall bulges and changes shape. As if it knows, that when it falls, it would be an astounding sight to behold.
