Hey! Did you see that? She looked at me! Focus, guys! You're so basic... Wake up, Amy! We gotta get the flag back! Calm down, I'm on it! Marty, go and help her! "No problemo"! Time to try my Super Speed! Isn't that a lawn mower? It was! Now it's the Marty-Turbo... Oh! Yeah! Dude! You're going the wrong way! Well done, Amy! Hey, Amy! Here! Let me help! I'm on my own! Amy! It's me, Marty! OK... Ah! Ah, ouch... ah! Oh... Yeah! Yeah! I've got the flag! Look out, Marty! Oh... Oh! 'Sup, loser? Ready to lose? Not this time... Awesome, man! Bring it to our base! I'll go under the docks! Yeah! The Moneyball move! Do it! Do it! What...?! Don't listen to Carrothead, it's too dangerous! Moneyball... here I go! He's dodging all of them like a boss! Ouch! Oh... Right in the face. That was awesome! If you'd achieved the Moneyball, I'd have put it on the school blog, on the cover, for real! If he'd done it he'd now be dating the blonde girl, but miracles don't exist! ... But we were close. That's the problem, man. We're always close... instead of there. Bye, losers! What's that dude got that I don't? You mean besides being hot, having muscles and having won three surf contests? Ouch, that hurts! Ha, ha! So funny... Hey, Igor! What's up, little guy? Did you miss me you little Godzilla? How well did you see us with your new Marty-Glasses? They're cool, huh? He so couldn't live without you... I know, we're thick as thieves. He's always by my side. Argh! Marty-Parachute! Marty-Parachute! I'm heading back, guys. We're celebrating my dad's birthday and my mom wants my grandfather to come for dinner. Cheer up, it's your grandfather! You obviously don't know the old geezer. Er... good luck! They delayed the mission until 2022! I've been training and trying more space suits than a model, for nothing! Honey, it's your birthday. Try to enjoy the rest of the day. Hey buddy, how did you do at the beach? Did you capture the flag? No, I fell. Again... Mike's a loser, Mike's a... Shut up, you brat. Is Grandpa Frank really coming to have dinner this time? Don't get too excited. Scott? Uh... I'll wait in the car. Honey... You're wasting your time! I see you are as stubborn as your father. Three, two, one... Oh! Yeah! That was awesome! Is that Grandpa? I'm alright, I'm alright! He's not coming. So there won't be a cake? That's too bad... Of course we'll have a cake, ladybug. Yeah! Cake, cake, yes! If granpa doesn't want to see us, why you still try? Because I promised you grandma Rose that I would do anything I could to get them to make peace. So that we could be a family again. But... if Grandpa doesn't want to, why can't we just leave him alone? Oh, Mike, never forget this: your grandfather is part of this family. And there's nothing more important than family. That's why we can't give up, alright? "His grandfather reinvented the oil industry!" "His father was the great visionary of nuclear energy!" "And today Richard Carson III owns the biggest energy empire in the world!" Ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome Richard Carson with a big round of applause! Yeah! How can that guy be on TV? He owns the channel. What's up babe? Looking good! I love you, Carson! Have it, baby! Ah! Oh! Mr. Carson? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Mr. Carson... Mr. Carson, you were going to make an announcement. Of course. Let's cut to chase. Did you know that 50% of the world population think that men never set foot on the Moon? Oh, come on, what's it with this guy? Yes, there are all kinds of conspiracy theories The Moon. My father's biggest dream. He offered part of his fortune to go. But NASA refused. My father, a man that had everything, died not having been able to achieve his biggest dream. Unfair! Well, such a mission requires well-prepared astronauts , doesn't it? No! That was their excuse! But today I'm going to reveal the truth. The whole world will know that the Space Race was nothing but a big, fat... lie! "It's an honor... and a priviledge to be here today on behalf of all peaceful men..." "Ouch!". "Cut!". "I want that guy out right now!" "Even a trained monkey could do it much better! I said "cut"!" Ha! I knew it! What?! That was fake! Yeah, right! And how do you know that, know-it-all? What are you talking about, idi...?! - Scott, the children... And why doesn't NASA go back to the Moon and prove that guy's a liar? I wish we could, but we don't have rockets prepared for that now. The Space Race finished years ago. Wow, your father would be very proud of what you found. Daddy... was my everything... When he died, I asked for his ashes to be merged with this diamond... so that he would always be with me... And I swore that I would do everything in my power to honor his memory. Aw... Unfair! It's time to end this fraud! I, Richard Carson III, will be the first man to set foot... on the Moon! Look, daddy, he does have a rocket! - Tess! Ha! That guy is awesome! That's for you, dad! Nonsense! How can they believe that presumptuous fraud? We're getting thousands of messages saying that the trip to the Moon was fake! Social networks are on fire! Everybody speaking about "the big lie". Ms. President, we need to stop this scam! I was just a little girl when it happened, but I remember very well the moment we set foot on the Moon. Ms. President, we have some intel. Carson intends to claim the Moon before the United Nations. Impossible! We put that flag in the name of mankind! If he goes and destroys what's left of the other missions, including the flag, the world will believe that he is the first man on the Moon. Ms. President, give me the order and I'll turn him to dust! Calm down, admiral. Just keep a look on that man. We will not let him rewrite History. We need to do something. Now! Pliers. Screwdriver. Will we get the flag with this? I find your lack of faith disturbing. The Marty-Rocket is the best. Everytime you say that, something terrible happens. Quiet, little reporter, and let the genius work. Right... How did dinner with your family go? Without my grandfather, as usual. Not cool, what's up with him? I don't know. All I know is that my grandfather was going to be part of the last mission to the Moon. But a few days before the take off he was cut off from the mission. Why? He wouldn't tell anyone. He just got away from the world. And one day, he left his own home. And my father never understood why. Since then, they barely speak to each other. My mother is doing everything she can to reunite them to no avail. Look at the bright side! I used to have a good six pack. And now... it's one big can. All thanks to my grandparents, that won't stop giving me sweets. I don't care anymore. It's always been like this in my family. Uh! Hold that. How can you not care? Don't say that. You don't know what you are missing. I have my grandparents, my nine siblings... my uncles, my cousins, my second cousins... Wow, are you guys a family or an entire country? Shut up, Carrothead! Seriously, don't give up. You should do something about it. You don't get it. I can't do anything. Nothing? You only need to get them to talk. Yeah, right. So easy... Ok, who cares, right? You are such a chicken. Hey, I'm not a chicken! Of course not... You are the king of chickens! Ah! Igor! See, genius? Disaster... Scott! Scott! Scott! Just what's my father doing here? Scott! Scott! We're going back! - Wait, what? National priority. Orders from the President. - What are you talking about, Jack? Sam, Scott, we're going back to the Moon! And you will be the commander! The mission's as follows: get to the Moon before Carson destroys the flag that was put there in 1969. If there's no flag, people'll believe we were never there. Wow! The Moon, a Goldwing on the Moon... Wait... And how are we going to go? Does the name Saturn V ring a bell? Are you kidding? That old piece of junk from the NASA museum? Bingo! They're going to repair it. Saturn V... The biggest rocket ever built. It's going to fly again after 45 years. We'll take off in a month. A month?! - Impossible! No one in NASA knows how to pilot that relic. - They've asked some former NASA astronauts for help, they'll train us. Well, I know somebody who's not going to care anyway. You know your father. It's the only one who refused to come. This is your chance, chicken. Ok, guys, we've got a mission. We need to bring this to my grandfather. The veterans are coming tomorrow and he needs to be there. Why don't you give him a call? He won't pick up the phone. What about an email? He doesn't have a computer. Come on, guys! And remember: failure... is not an option! I'm always following you.. I want to be a great reporter, not a great criminal! I'll watch from here. Here, the "walkies". Go with them, Godzilla. I didn't think we would have a second chance. At my age, every second is a second chance. Stop the chitchat. Let's refresh our memory. NASA needs us. Marty, astro-grandpas in sight. Activate Godzilla. Godzilla activated. "Conect the cell phone. It will be your eyes". If he breaks my phone, I'm going to turn Carrothead into a carrot cake. Igor, run. All clear. "Go." Wait, security guard coming out from the main door. We gotta to do something to distract him. Darn it! Hey! Hi, Trent. Are you playing with rockets again? No, of course not. We never... You can go on now. There's a woman in the counter, to the left. Marty, get Igor to the first floor. "Gotcha." Mayday, Marty, it's the cleaning lady! You see that, guys? You clearly need my genius. Stop boasting and do something! Uh, uh... Something happened. I can't see anything. I'm going to turn him into a carrot soup. Marty, get Igor out of here! But I can't see anything! We're going to get caught! Turn it off! Now! Alright, failure is not an option. Marty-Rocket, now! Hey, you shouldn't be here! Oh, I'm sorry, I was looking for the exit... Alright, come with me. Ah! What are you doing here? I'll tell him. It'll be for the best. I'm more eloquent when it comes to giving news. I'll tell him. No, I insist, Gigs, I am the number one. I should tell him. What a piece of junk! These drills are trash! You are fired! Get out of here! Ah! -Ah... Excuse me, sir... but if you every need to make another fake movie, you can count on me. Alright... Now get lost. So, what's going on? Gigs has something to tell you! Is that so? Uh... NASA is going... back to the Moon. What?! And why the hell do they have to go now? 40 years... And they have to go now? Whose idea was that? The order came from... the... the President herself. Oh, so the President wants to play. Let's see if she dares interfering in my business when I arrive on the Moon and I get my new toy. "Carson Industries proudly presents the energy of the future. The final alternative to oil. "A material rarely found on Earth, but available on the Moon in endless quantities". Helium 3! Aren you not going to the Moon to fulfill your father's dream? Ha! Dad couldn't care less about the Moon. But, as he used to say: "Go like a rocket and always fill your pocket". I can tell you it's an honor to be the commander in this historic mission. Hi, Mike. Hi, Joe. You coming to see your father? Yeah. What about the veterans? About to arrive. Come on in. Hey! Look at that! This is... awesome! Oh! Take some pictures and upload them on Facebook. The girls will go crazy! Hey, can you take a pic, Amy? If the camera can capture my charm, that is. Amy, can't you stop tweeting for five seconds? I'm not tweeting, I'm ignoring you. Hey, the astro-grandpas are here! "Ladies and gentlemen, it's a pleasure to announce the arrival of the veterans from the lunar missions." Mr. Aldrin, please look at the camera. Here, please, Mr. Collins. - I have a question. Look at the camera, please. Only one question. - Here, Mr. Collins. Could you answer a question? Uh, weren't dinosaurs extinct? He hasn't come... Scott, I've assigned the instructors. You are going to love yours. Surprise me! Is it Collins? Ah, Aldrin! Tell me it's Aldrin. Mike, look! Ah... Michael. Scott, let me introduce you to your instructor: Captain in the reserve, Frank Goldwing. It's truly an honor. Sweet! Right here, please! Please, sir. - Here, look, sir. Look over here! Thanks. Look at the camera please. Yeah! Ah, the Goldwings! I love family reunions. You are the man, congratulations. You got the cover. But this could ruin the plan. What if they get to the Moon before us? Impossible! And I don't care if we gotta cheat, lie, steal... Have I said "cheat" yet? Just make sure the Goldwings fail. Flight test positive. Starting landing simulation. Careful, it's a difficult maneuver. Understood. - It's "Understood, Captain". Understood, Captain. Wow, man, that's boss! How did you get here? Dad got us passes. We'll talk about that later. Step aside, the Commander is going to land. Dad! Dad, can we get on that? Negative, that's not a toy. Oh, come on. It's alright, guys. I'm in charge here. Commander, you are breaking the rules. Oh, why do you care? Please, Grandpa, please! Captain, do you remember when you gave me a ride on it? It's one of my best memories. We're out of fuel! - "That's not possible." I checked it myself. - Are you sure? Of course! Call off the mission, jump! No. I can land. No, you can't! Not at that speed. - It's safer. Brace yourselves! Oh! Come on...! - Oh! Scott, jump! Jump! Jump!! Ah! I'm gonna die without kissing a girl... I'm gonna die without kissing a girl! Well don't look at me, coward. Are you alright, guys? Yes, Dad. Igor? Igor! Igor isn't breathing! He needs the mouth-to-mouth! What?! No way! Mike, do it, dude! Look at the poor thing! Uh, I'll pass. It's your pet. Oh man! I was hoping my first kiss would be with a model! Dad, are you alright? Argh! - Can you move? - Why do you care? That NASA mission is still going forward?! Argh! No one defies Richard Carson! No one! Gags, let's start the test! Everything is ready, sir. Perfect. Crank it up, Gigs! Hum... Impressive! 20 times more powerful than nuclear energy! It'll be the biggest monopoly in History. Now, Gigs, let's try it as a weapon. Excuse me, sir. You'll destroy the model. And we have to keep testing it. Who cares?! I care, sir. It took me 8 months to build it piece by piece. Cheer up, you're hired for another 8 months. Gigs, activate the weapon! Yes, sir. But... Gigs, I told you to activate the weapon! Worked as a charm. But there's a little issue, sir. So... fix it! But the thing is... Gags was still there... Oh! Well, congratulations, Gigs. You've just been promoted. You're now a model supervisor. Scott, you can't go on like this, cheer up. You'll have another chance. No, I won't! It was the only one and I've lost it. Thanks to my father. Honey, it was an accident. - That doesn't matter now! No Goldwing will ever get to the Moon It's a curse. I know it's disappointing, but there are more important things. You don't get it! Going to the Moon and getting the flag was my mission! The Moon is every astronaut's dream! What is there more important than that? Maybe you're the one who doesn't get it! History is repeating itself. My father will leave and become a grumpy old man, like my grandfather My family is a disaster. Come on, don't say such things. You've managed to reunite them after, like, a thousand years. Yeah, and things just got a thousand times worse. I'm an idiot. Don't be like that! Stop whining or I'll kick your butt and send you to the Moon. Ha, that would be cool. A butt on the Moon! Wow! Amy, you are a genius! Who? Her...? Ha! My grandfather couldn't go, my father couldn't either, but I can! I'll go to the Moon! Yeah, someday... Not someday. In two weeks! What are you talking about? It's crazy, but I could hide in the rocket and... Yeah right, come back to Earth. It would end the curse. I'll do what my father and grandfather couldn't do, and everything will be fine! I'm going to the Moon! And you two are going to help me. Who's with me? I am! Marty? Wait, let me see if I get it. You're gonna to get into that old junk and fly at 20,000mph? Yeah. And go to a place where there's no oxygen or gravity? Yeah. A place where, until now, only 12 astronauts have gone? Yeah. Ah, screw it! You are "astronishing"! I'm in! Yeah! Yeah! I'm going to the Moon! Ah! Uh, dude, the Moon's that way. So, in order to reach the rocket you gotta get to the launching platform first. But it's like a fortress surrounded by the sea and protected by a metal fence. I've examined the options and I think this is the best one... Igor! It's not time to play Godzilla! Come here, Igor. Guys, let's focus. Marty, what's our best option? Giving up, man. It's impossible to get inside. Doesn't matter how crazy you are. Come on! There's gotta be a way. Something the three of us can do. No, the two of you. What? Are you backing down? Who's the coward now? If my parents catch me, I'll be grounded for life. They're very strict with rules. They'll send me to a military academy like 3 of my 52 cousins. What...? 52 plus the twins of the step-sister of the sister in law of my uncle Pablo. Yeah, excuses. I'm so sorry. Just ignore him, Amy. Don't worry. We'll manage. Well you better come up with something, Michael Goldwing. There's no way we can get in there. There is a way! What was that? I heard something. Come on, you've become a scaredy-cat since you saw "Revenge of the Zombie-Rats". That one wasn't half as scary as "Piranha-Zombie 3". Dude, you have to do something about that... Marty, don't make a sound. Ok. I'll be as silent as a ninja. This way! Uh! That was close! What was that? Darn rocks... You and your zombie-rats... It must've been an alligator. Whatever that was, it's gone. Oh! What the...? Marty... Ah! I almost had a heart attack, dude! There it is! See? It's just an alligator. Don't fall off again. I'm trying, but this is full of... rocks? Igor, just what's going on with you? Can you stop making noise? I'm sorry. Igor's gone bananas! I don't know what's up with him. Argh! Mike, I think we forgot something... Sure, sealing your mouth with glue. No, it's much worse! Alligators! Igor, attack and destroy! Marty-Punch! Marty-Poke-in-the-Eye! Marty-Blinding-Light! What the heck is going on? - Zombie-rats. It's the zombie-rats! Will you stop that? Marty-Lightsaber! It's not working! Not working! Ah! Amy! I knew you couldn't make it without me, Carrothead! What are you saying? It's all under control! Guys, prepare to jump! Turn on the fans in three, two, one... Uh, guys? Two... Guys... One... I don't have a fan! Come on! Higher, higher! I'll need a bigger fan! Ah! Marty! I'm stuck! Wait, we'll get you out. Don't worry, the guards are coming, go! Thank you, dude, we owe you one. Go on without me! I will sacrifice myself for this mission! I'll be fine... Uh... Igor, where are you going? You traitor! Don't leave me! There you have your zombie-rat... Mr. Carson, can you look here? Sir, a picture, please. - Mr. Carson, a question. What do you hope to find on the Moon? Bye bye, earthlings! I'm going to make history! Did you check the ventilation systems? Yes, everything's working. Wait, Mike! It'll be better if I go home now. OK, but I need you to close the hatch. The thing is I sleepwalk. Sounds weird, I know. But when I woke up, I didn't know how to go back and... You think you are so smart, huh? This is abuse of authority. I demand to speak to your boss. Don't worry, here he comes. Uh, oh... Wow! Amy, look at this! I can't believe we're here. Are you alright, son? Dad. Hey, what were you doing in the launching zone? Uh... I'll only speak in presence of my lawyer. Marty! "Marty, do you copy?" "We're in the casserole." "Can you hear me? We're in." In? What does that "in" mean? When you arrive on the Moon take a picture, OK? It'll be the cover of the school newspaper. Sure. Can you tell me how on Earth did you get here?! Uh, Grandpa... What are you doing here? Have you gone crazy? Get out! Now! What have you done? Sabotage in process. The rocket will take off without its crew and get lost in the void. "Perfect. 'Sayonara', Ms President". Don't move! What the...? Engines 1 and 2, activated! What?! Eh... All engines are on? What have you done? Uh? Can you help us open this? Impossible, it's blocked! Mission control, do you copy? "Frank Goldwing speaking." "We're trapped in the Apolo Module". What a night... Another one like this and I quit. - Calm down. There won't be more surprises before take off. Wait a minute... Have you seen that, Jack? - Doesn't make any sense. The spacecraft was to take off in 10 hours! Call Goldwing! Hey, you there! Don't move! This place is off-limits! What happened? - Don't get anxious, but... The system has been sabotaged. We can't stop it. It's your... Cool, isn't it? Wait, Scott! Hello, Mr. Gold... Silence! ...wing. Mission Control here. What are you doing in there, Captain? I was taking care of a couple of stowaways... "when the hatch got locked." - Stowaways? Captain, what are you doing? Ah! Frank, who's over there? I found your son and his girlfriend inside the capsule. Huh? What...? Girlfriend? Excuse me? She's not my girlfriend! I don't want a girlfriend! How could he believe that? "Don't care about girls." That's what I was trying to say. - We're just friends. Enough is enough! Mike! What are you doing there?! I just wanted to break the curse of our family! Curse? Which curse? What are you talking about? We don't have time for arguing. We have two options: going to the Moon or ejecting! That would be the end of the mission! Yes? - "Sir," we've been sabotaged. They won't believe who's behind this... Stop Carson, don't let him take off. "To all units, stop Richard Carson." "Stop Carson." Done. Let's go, Gigs. One minute left until launching. Captain, activate the eject mechanism. Please! We must get rid of the curse! Captain, activate it now! "Captain? Captain? Captain, what's going on?" I'm afraid the mechanism has been sabotaged as well. In that case, we only have one option left... We're going to the Moon. That's the first thing we've agreed on in 40 years. Let the launch start. Confirm if you're ready. Eecom! Fido! - Ready. GNC! Retro! - Ready. So we're setting off, Captain? Call me "Commander". Ready for launching. CAP COM! - Ready. Doctor! - Ready. Guidance! - More than ready. Green light! No, no, no, no! I can't stay here! I have to get out of here! My parents will kill me! This is a one in a lifetime chance! You'll be the first woman to be on the Moon! Stop chitchatting, kids, and put your suits on. Everything's ready for take-off, sir. We're setting off, Daddy! One rule! I break one single rule in my life... and I end up in a rocket heading to the Moon. Cool! Ladies and gentlemen, we have a mission to accomplish. "Commander, let's take that flag before Carson destroys it." And remember, failure is not an option. Excuse me... Mmm, sir... Oh, has anyone seen my lizard? Igor! Ignition sequence. "Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... Engines running." Let's put out a great show. Three, "two, one..." "Launching!" "We've taken off at 10 hours," 23 minutes and 17 seconds! Yay! Ah! Yeeha! An old man and two kids? The crew of Saturn Five are... an old man and two kids? Yes, Ms. President... But that's not all... Go on. Carson has developed a system to extract Helium 3 from the Moon. Helium 3 is the most powerful source of energy known to date. - Now it all makes sense. He's deceived the world and sabotaged our rocket with the only goal of becoming the most powerful man on Earth. Ms. President, we can fire some missiles to get rid of him. Calm down, Admiral. If we arrive before he does, we'll prove he's a liar. We need that flag, and this old man and these kids are our only hope. Oh... It's amazing... Impressive. Mind-blowing! Hey! "Marty, are you there?" Wah! Hello. Mission Control here. Is Igor with you? Affirmative. He's perfectly fine. Got it. The engineers have fixed the system. Now we have control over the flight. Scott, tell me it's a joke. Sam, I don't know how it could... - Tell me our son... isn't inside that rocket! -Calm down, calm down. Everything's going to be fine. "I'm sorry, Mom!" "This is all my fault." Oh, goodness! Mike! Are you okay? Yes... I'm very sorry about this fuss. Honey, that doesn't matter now. Come back safely, understood? I promise. Mom, do I get his room? Tess! Oh, hello Mrs. Goldwing. Tell my parents I won't break the rules ever again! I will, Amy. Frank, for God's sake, look after them. Trust me. I won't let anything happen to them. Are you my grandpa? Here I go, riding my spaceship... Sir, an alert. NASA's rocket is approaching. What?! How's that even possible? There's just one possible answer: it's manned. The sabotage failed. Ah... I'm surrounded by a bunch of loafers. Alright, I'll have to take care of this myself. You can't do that, sir. There's an old man and two kids in there. So what?! As my father said: "Go like a rocket and always fill your pocket" Oh, I can't believe it. What? The Marty-Survival Kit. And he was supposed to survive just on this for three days? What's wrong, dude? That's the base of my diet. Let's open one! No, wait! What do you bet? I bet I'll catch more than you! Don't even dream about it. Oh! Hey, that's cheating. That one was mine. Hey! The last one is for me. No way! Oh... So just friends... - Ah... Hey, what was that? Commander, what's that noise? Something hit us. It's trying to break through the casing. Stay here. Don't go outside, no matter what, understood? I'm getting out of the capsule. I repeat. I'll proceed to get out of the capsule. "What? Frank, no!" Frank! Frank! I don't know if he's deaf or just the most stubborn guy in the world! It's the latter. Grandpa! I must help him. Put your helmet on, I'm going outside. Hold on! What are we doing about Igor? Ready! There I go, Grandpa! Ah... Darn electric spider! Go away! Ah! Oh! Oh! Yeah! We did it, Grandpa! You disobeyed me and almost got killed! I... I'm sorry. I just wanted to... Don't ever disobey my orders. Roger, Commander... Ah... Okay, we'll do it your way. Give me an order. Mike, help me with the bandage. It's an order. You saved my life. You've been really brave. Scott? No, I'm Sam. Scott's sleeping. "How are the kids doing?" They're fine. They're fast asleep. They'll be back home soon. "I promise." - Thanks, Frank. Samantha... Thanks for never giving up. I'm more grateful than you think. Thank your grandson. "For better or worse, this is his doing." Frank, enjoy the moment. Fate owed you this journey. Now rest. Good night. I just wanted our family to be back together. Commander, why did you leave home? Go back to sleep... Are you my grandpa? Detaching in course. Splitting lunar module. "Module detached." Starting landing sequence. Don't worry, your father will make it. Starting descent. Wow... Commander, you're deviating from the path. Fix the navigation. Roger. Commander, do you need help? I'm fine. Commander, I'll say it again: you're out of the path. Let me help you, Grandpa. Er... Commander. Alright, use your controls. Slowly. Smooth moves. It works better now. What? What happened? Was it me? No, it wasn't you. Alarm 1201. Hey! I didn't touch anything! Gentlemen, emergency protocol. "It seems the on-board computer has been damaged." That's why it was so hard to operate. It's leading us to the wrong place. Can you hear me? Roger, Commander. You'll need to deactivate the guidance system. That's what happened in 1969. The chances of success are minimal. The same ones I have on this hottie. Amy, find it. There should be a button with "AGC" on it. Mike, to the left. AGC. AGC. 20 seconds to landing. - Too fast. AGC... Slow down! Hurry up! The computer's giving contradictory instructions! Where are you? 10 seconds... - They're going to crash. Frank! Let's get going! "Eight, seven, six..." Amy, please. "Five, four..." "Three..." I got it! Press it, for God's sake! "Mission Control, Base of Peace of Mind here." "The Falcon has landed." Hooray! Oh... You've done great, guys. Yeah! Yay! Ah! Ready? We're recording. Amy, you're live. Everybody's watching you. Grandpa... How cool! For Amstrong it might've been just a small step, but for me it's going to be... Wow! Yes! Yes! I'm the first woman on the Moon! We're back just like the first time, as a light of hope for mankind. Come on, kids, we have a mission. We're losing the signal. Commander, the antenna is damaged. Transferring communications to the antenna of the lunar rover. Get that flag. Let the world see who arrived first! Yeah, rock and roll! Yay! Look, Mike and Amy are on TV. Hurry up, Grandpa! We should be near it. There it is! The flag! Oh, no! It can't be. Ha, I knew it! Losers! Oh. What are we doing now? My job here is done. Gigs, take the minibots to the base. Hurry up! Yes, sir. Oh, goodness. They're going to destroy the remains of all the missions. Hey, Amy, they're still there! Come on, record it! We lost the signal! What's happening? Commander, can you hear me? What happened? Oh, how unexpected. What's next, TV ads? We're unable to restore the communication. Transfer the communication to another antenna. Impossible. The one in the rover was the only one working. We need to restore the communication, no matter what! Hey. Where can I plug this? Do you intend to connect an USB to a 1969 computer? Are you nuts? I might be able to fix it... Yes, I need to establish a connection through any guidance station in the world. I hope. Come home, baby. You'll be my personal trophy. He has the flag! Let's take it back. Come on, Igor. Take the flag. Huh? Oh! What the...? Go away, you disgusting alien! Let's go. Ha! Ah! Come on Igor, jump! What?! That flag's mine! Ha! Ah! Yeah! Oh! We did it! Oh! No! Ah! Watch out! Ah! Grandpa! This isn't over yet! I want a full report of the communication systems in the module. Now! Ha! It's fine if we have to redirect the satellite. We'll just do it! Listen, where can I find a radio from the sixties? There's a bunch of old gadgets in the basement. Oh, come on! We lost communication, we can't pilot this thing and that lunatic kidnapped Grandpa... We're done. Huh? Hello, my gooey cockroaches! Oh, shut up, you weirdo. Listen, you little thieves. "I'll propose you a deal. If you give me the flag" I'll give you the old wreck back. No, Mike, don't do it! Grandpa! You don't have to answer now. I'll call you in... "ten seconds." Oh, I love being generous. No, wait! It's over. No, we can't give up. There's nothing left to do, Amy. Time up! We accept the deal. Good guy. Bring me the flag. I got it! Darn it! I need something that increases electric resistance. Copper, tin! Huh? I think this will do. He's very mean. What's this? What's the matter? I'm getting messages... It can't be! The antenna is broken. Seriously, I keep getting them. That's impossible. There's nothing here that can transmit from.. Marty! Ah! You reached your destination. I couldn't stand it anymore. Wow! It's huge! "Adjusting gravity." Open the door. Welcome. Let's get straight to the point. Give me the flag! First, my grandfather! Of course. A deal is a deal. Gigs. Grandpa! Mike! Oh... I love family reunions. Don't you, Gigs? I can't remember my family, sir. Let him go! Give me the flag or I'll get rid of the old wreck. Alright! I'll give you the flag. How moving. Gigs, release him. And after a reunion, there's always a goodbye. Gigs, get rid of them. What? Excuse me, sir? You're miserable, Mr. Carson. What'd you know, you maggot? You think you're a genius, but we all know you'd be a nobody without for your father's money. How dare you... you brat! He's right. He always spoonfed you. You've done nothing at all! You know nothing, you annoying kid! Do you think all this stuff was built by itself?! Do you mean this factory or whatever this is? It's more than a factory, you ignorant brat! It's a mine of Helium 3, the biggest source of energy ever known. And it is only mine! Behold my work! My father would be proud of me! Of a liar like you? You deceived the world by saying that humans had never been to the Moon. Proud of my brightness. Only a genius could deceive everyone. Only a genius could get their hands on the largest energetic monopoly. I'll sell my energy to the whole planet and if any country is unwilling to pay, boom!, I'll disintegrate it. Just like what I'm going to do with you. "Go like a rocket and always fill your pocket." Cool! Cool? How's that cool? You just gave me the best headline ever. What are you talking about, you little brat? Worldwide exclusive! Richard Carson just confessed he's a criminal. Smile, we're on air! The whole world is watching you. "What's going on?" "What's going on? Gigs? What's this all about? Gigs!" Amy Gonzlez reporting live from the Moon. We're heading back to Earth. Yeah! Yeah! Great! Yeah, great! - Losers... I always trusted NASA. See? An old computer from NASA, my 800 GHz Marty-Antenna, four little gadgets and "voil" the new Marty-Communicator! How could they communicate with Earth? How?! Come on, Igor, now! They have their own portable antenna. Ah! Did you let them in with that gadget?! You're fired! This way! Don't let them escape! Come on, stop them! But am I fired or not? Gigs! Watch out! Jump! No! Commander, can you hear me? Grandpa! Mike! Ah! Mike, stop it. I'm not losing you again. Stop. Listen to me. Mike, my helmet is broken. I'm running out of oxygen. In the spaceship, you asked me... something I haven't answered for 40 years. Why did you leave home? A few days before the mission to the Moon, your father came back from school with chicken pox. So you caught it and that's why... they didn't allow you to go to the Moon? Yes. I was infected. And I was replaced. And you blamed Dad? It wasn't his fault! That's true. It wasn't. But going to the Moon was what I longed for the most. And losing my chance made me feel like a loser "who deserved nothing." "Not even my family." "Actually," I felt horrible for blaming Scott. "I looked at my son and felt ashamed of holding a grudge against him." "And because of that, I thought I was a bad father." "I felt so bad I thought he'd be better off without me." I was wrong. That was the biggest mistake of my life. "Now, hit it!" "Move aside, Grandpa!" It's a great story. Shall we end it on Earth? No! Not again! I got you! This is the last time you'll ever fool me! Seriously, I can't stand that thing! You ruined my plans! My life! And now you're gonna pay for it! Hurry up, guys! We gotta get away! We won't get far together. You're running out of oxygen. Go back to the spaceship. Trust me, Grandpa. I have a plan. Amy, use it as a surfboard. But Mike...! Run away, Grandpa! Do you want this, Carson? Die! What's your plan? Getting an actual kiss from you before I die. What?! Look out! Let's teach them a lesson, Dad! Ah, ah! The alien strikes back! Ah! Ah, I'm gonna crush you, maggot! Ha! Marty, I need you. Yes, I'm essential. Activate the Marty-Rocket now. Are you sure? Do you know it's still undergoing trial? Just do it! Okay, okay. Marty-Rocket activated! Ah! Hit it! Now! I got you! OK, this deserves a kiss. Let me tell you the plan first. Guys, what's going on up there? Did I miss something? Come on, Daddy, let's crush these brats. Marty, slow down! Speed up, speed up! No, slow down. Now go faster! Dude, will you make up your mind? What? I'm a machine! Where are we going? Please, tell me the plan. Carson still has the mine of Helium 3. It's a danger for all humanity. What should we do? In order to avoid it we'd have to destroy the base! That's the plan. What?! Have you lost it?! Oh, Mike, don't tell me you're thinking about... Are you going to do...? The Moneyball. Trust me, Amy. Are you with me? I'll smash you! I'll destroy you! Hold me! I'll crush you like cockroaches! Ah! Oh... Mike, can you hear me? Mike, can you hear me? "Mike, can you hear me?!" Hooray, yes!... Dad! Mission accomplished, Grandpa! Not yet. There's something left to do. "In 1969, the human race achieved a great milestone and planted a flag to claim the Moon on behalf of the whole humanity." "Today, almost 50 years later, we repeat that same movement highlighting the fact that this beautiful natural satellite doesn't belong to a single person, company or country, but to the human race." "Something next generations must protect together, just like a family." Yay! You always come back. You guide my steps. Everything is different if I think you're there. I leave my fears far away from here. I change my path just for you. I follow you. I follow you. I follow you till the end. Nothing changes us. Nobody will stop us. Nothing changes us. Nobody will stop us. Nothing changes us. Nothing will change us. Nothing will change us. Nothing will change us. I follow you. Dad? Am I in heaven? Is that you, Dad? Eh... Mr. Carson? Gigs? What are you doing here? And without a helmet... It turns out I don't need it. I'm an android. Gags made me. Gigs, if you see this, it's because your life is fading away. That's it, Gigs, you're an android. I created you. Oh, poor thing. You lost your father too. Yes, you killed him, sir. Don't worry, I'll forgive you. Now you have me. Gigs, can we turn off that damn annoying robot? No sir, it has an infinite Helium 3-driven battery. Perfect. What kind of idiot authorised this? It was you, sir. Oh. Well, nobody's perfect.
