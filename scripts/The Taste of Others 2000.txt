At the office, at school, | it's the same everywhere. There's always a prick. They're not all dishonest. | Give me a break. You say that because they don't | tell you what's going on. But if you dig a little... If you order twelve oysters | and one's bad... you don't throw them all... How many examples do we need? The office, school, oysters. | I got it already. You offer $20 to an oyster, | what's it going to do? - Your example isn't a good one. | - Maybe this one isn't. But you can't condemn everyone | because of one that's corrupt. Maybe this guy was honest. So why didn't he impose | an obvious penalty? - Maybe he didn't see it. | - No? - It's sneaky and underhanded. | - Who knows? They're exactly the same. We're well-positioned. It's a mere formality, | but it should clinch the deal. On the other hand, | we can forget about Simpson. I'm not surprised. | He's just a fag. Miss! Please, bring us some | little pastries, the little... - Mignardises. | - Yes. And the check, please. What? Those are really bad for you. I didn't have any dessert. It's exactly these little things | that you should avoid. - We had a very rich meal. | - It's too late, anyway. Do I have to go tomorrow? | Can't you go alone? Why do I have to be there? I thought it was a good idea. | But if you prefer... I only know four English words. I'll be there, asking you the | whole time, "What's he saying? "Tell him that..." | It's going to slow things down. - Go by yourself, I prefer... | - You have a 3:30 today. A 3:30 appointment? | With whom? Mrs. Devaux, | the English teacher. Oh, yes. Is it really necessary? You make what a month? | Eight thousand? - More. | - Ten thousand? - Less. | - So, nine thousand. - Less. | - Who cares? That's not the point. | I'm explaining something. Imagine you're a referee. A guy offers you some dough, | just like that. He asks you to look | the other way. What do you do? Give them a call to explain. I'll call them right away... to say that 4:30 is better. It's just half an hour. THE TASTE OF OTHERS This Weber is a real gem. Could you close | your window, honey? Effiicient, devoted. | I admire him, really. - I give him enough money. | - Excuse me? I pay him like a king. He'd better be devoted. | The opposite would amaze me. The money he earns | isn't important. I'm talking about | human qualities, about... He's such a smart dresser. You should ask him | where he buys his suits. I ate too much. I won't eat. | An apple and right to bed. You, eat an apple? | That would be surprising. We're going to | the theater tonight. Aw, shit! Aw, hell! Do I have to go, too? Your niece knows we're coming. Why did we tell her? What the hell will we do there? - Good afternoon, Mr. Castella. | - How are you, Gustave? - Did we change the robot? | - Yes, last night. No problem. - Did we lose much? | - About 10 hours. The production's back on again. Do they really | have to follow me everywhere? That's the idea. Franck. I'm not used to it, | so explain a little. You must follow me everywhere? That's what I'm paid to do. Here in the plant? | What can happen? A bad situation | can happen anywhere. An attacker has | plenty of choices. I think you're the one | who's going to... Mrs. Devaux has been waiting | for 15 minutes. - Who? | - Devaux. - Your English teacher. | - Oh, yes, dammit. Let her in. When do we sign | with the Iranians? - Wouldn't I like to know. | - This bodyguard is oppressive. - I know, but the insurance... | - Screw them. Here you go. - Good afternoon. | - Hi. - Sit down, Mrs... | - Miss Devaux. - You're an English teacher? | - Yes, I give English classes. Do you have funny | teaching methods? Funny? I wouldn't know | if my methods are funny. How long will it take? I have to know | your level first. What? I said I have to | know your level... how much English | you already speak. I have to... So you don't speak | English at all? Yes, yes. Anyway, I think it's better | to start directly in English... so you get used to it... to hear the language | and the words. It's better? Yes, it is. OK. You know what? I'm going to think about it, | and I'll contact you. So, we're done? Yes. I... I'll call you. OK. All right. You'll feel good here. This is a nice apartment. - Thanks to you. | - No, it's Jean-Jacques, really. But it's really... It's really kind. He's your brother. | It's only natural. - We never see each other. | - But he's your brother. He couldn't let you sleep | in the streets with your kids. He has money, | so he can help you. He never held it against you. What exactly? That you ignored him. He invited you over many times. Paris is not that far away. | You never came. You never came either. Well... Where are your children? With their father. He's going to help a bit? I don't know. It's odd, I never liked | your husband from the beginning. I did. Some fabric would look nice | here, don't you think? I was thinking about | this green... Green? Oh, no, | it's a cold and harsh color. Something warm, reassuring. I don't know... | Dusty pink, maybe? Or else a flowery fabric. That's Flucky. | What's happening? Fuck! I can't believe this. Is this dog neurotic, or what? - It's your dog? | - No need to be rude. - Yes, it's my dog. | - Muzzle him. He's dangerous. | The little shit got me! - He bit him. | - What did you do? What did I do? I was walking. | He doesn't like people walking? There must be a reason. | Something must have happened. I didn't do a thing! | Enough already! Could you stop screaming? | It's very upsetting. - Keep calm. | - I'll bite your calf... and see if you keep calm. That's enough! Excuse him, | excuse him, end of story. I asked him to keep calm... and he threatened | to bite me... to see if I keep calm. What a disagreeable | and aggressive fellow. I thought he deserved it. | He was not a nice man. Listen, you'll have to do | something. He bites a lot. Yes, but, you know, | it's always with reason. When he's bothered | or when people are mean. - Dogs can feel that. | - Yes, that's true. These seats are hell! You want to have a bite? | Then we congratulate her. No, Jean-Jacques! That wouldn't be nice. | We're here now. Some guy, | armed to the teeth, says... "You move, you're dead". | What do you do? I don't move. - You do like everyone else? | - There's nothing else to do. I try to stay alive. She looks like my fiance, | that girl, something in her... You have a fiance? | I haven't met her. She's not here. She's doing an internship | in the U. S. - When will she get back? | - In four months. You're patient. I'm in love. That helps. I wanted to ask you something. Have you ever killed someone? Here, let us pause. The splendor of these halls | is new to your eyes, Arsaces. Oft to this chamber, | stately and withdrawn... Titus often unburdens | his most secret thoughts. Shit! They're speaking | in rhymes! Here it is sometimes, | stealing from his Court... he comes to whisper... Those costumes are ugly. This door gives access | to his private chamber... and this other entrance | leads into the Queen's. Go to her... Tell her, loathe | to intrude on her... I dare to ask her | for a private talk. Yes. Yes, this must be painful. | That's fine. Aah! Aah! You destroyed my larynx. You're crazy. It hurts. - What are you thinking about? | - I'm not thinking. I'm bored. You looked like | you were thinking. Castella is OK, but this job | is a fucking bore. Can you buy me some cigarettes? | I can't move. That's convenient, isn't it? | "I can't move". - What kind do you smoke? | - I don't care. Thank you. He won't be here all night? | It's going to be hot. Thursday? Yes. It would be nice | if you could do the closing. I don't know. I'll have to see. - There's someone at the bar. | - Oh, yes. - Good evening. | - Could we eat something? Yes. Here you are. | Everything from here down. You don't remember me? No. Uh... Don't worry. Miss? I'll have a... ham and cheese. OK. Where did we meet, exactly? | I'm sorry... It doesn't matter. | We just had sex. We had sex? It was a while ago. I've cut my | hair since, and we were smashed. Yes, but it's amazing | that I wouldn't remember. Don't worry. It happens. More often to men, | but it happens. It's only natural. | We're not made equal physically. It's not the same act, | the same... involvement. Let's drop it. Or if we are not | master of our tears... Isn't Virginie down there? - At least let honor... | - That's her. Let the whole world | plainly recognize... an Emperor's tears | and the tears of a Queen. For, my Princess, | we must part. Cruel. Is this the time to speak? What have you done? | I thought myself beloved. Accustomed to the joy of seeing | you, I lived for you alone. Did you not know your laws | when I first confessed my heart? To what excess you've led me! | Why did you not say... "Wretched Queen, | you are too far committed? "Curb your hopes. | Give not your heart". Look at her face. Did you not take it, | only to return it... when its one wish | was to depend on you? The empire planned | our downfall ceaselessly... there still was time. You could have left me then? A thousand reasons then | could comfort me. I could have blamed your father | for my death... the people, the Senate, | the whole Empire, Rome... rather than so dear a hand. I know what torments | are in store for me. I feel without you | I may no more Iive. I had sex with this chick, | and I didn't remember. It was so fucking embarrassing. And when she told me... I had a good look, and | I still didn't remember. It's only natural. | Same thing could happen to me. From the 200 or 300 I've fucked, | I would recognize twenty. Once you're drunk, once it's | dark, or when it's quick... - You can't remember them all. | - Yeah, you're right. Is "200 or 300" | a figure of speech? No, not at all. I'm forty-five. | I started at fifteen. If you average eight | to ten chicks a year... over thirty years, | thirty times ten is 300. I'm forty. That's, let's see... | twenty- five years... multiplied by... two, let's say... fifty. - Fifty... not bad. | - Shit! You think too much. No... I stayed with | a few of them. What about you? Yes. Once. - Did you buy me cigarettes? | - I forgot. I'll be back. Manie. I should have remembered. I didn't tell you it. Um... no. What? Go ahead. Would you be interested | in going out one of these days? - Just to talk. | - OK. I'll give you my number. - Yes? | - Coffee, please. Yes, right away. Want to get a bite? - Yes, of course. | - See you tomorrow. - What a bore, what a bore! | - I liked it. - You're silly. | - It's slow. It's way too slow. You slow down the scene. | It should go twice as fast. - Where is Laurent? | - Virginie. - Hi. | - Who's that guy? The director. - So, you're happy? | - Did you like it? We didn't see you much. | It was too short. But you were cute. The costumes | were ugly, but you were cute. - But did you enjoy the play? | - Oh, yes. You don't know how to cry. - The tears were... | - It's very difficult. It's hard for an actor, along | with the memorization, right? Anyway, you had three lines. - What's wrong? | - What's the problem? - We're leaving, Valerie. | - I'm coming. See you tomorrow. | We'll meet outside. What's wrong? | I found it really good. - On my tab? | - Yeah. Let's go together, | it would be less boring. I'd like to come. | I love the atmosphere. The unemployment agency ... | it's warm, convivial. - I like being humiliated. | - I may not have enough hours. What about the Ibsen play? I haven't heard a thing. | And you? They're going nowhere. | They haven't got money. It's not happening. - You're not constantly working? | - No, I'm not, after all. I'm not an actress in demand. Each time an actor tells me, | "I'm doing this and that"... I want to strangle him. Fred's always smiling at me. | Is it a tic, or what? - Does he smile at you? | - Not particularly. I have a soft little | black piece waiting for you. Have you decided? - Roast beef. | - Pot pie. I'm hungry. I also have | a little Moroccan stuff. - Is the black stuff expensive? | - A gram is 60. Wow! I don't know. | I'll stop by, and we'll see. The table behind you, next to | Regine- Anne. Don't look now. They were talking about | the play. They loved it. And the guy with | the long hair... He's very fond of you. | Don't look now! - He's not bad. | - I think he's revolting. - Revolting? | - I don't like his kind. - Is there anybody you like? | - Why? You don't like | any guy I show you. That's not it at all. So show me someone you like. I don't know... That man there in | the corner, for example. Where? That old man, there? Yes, but you see, he moves me. - To have sex with him? | - It's not about that. - Have sex with whom? | - With no one. That's the point. It's sad. - I was trying to tell her... | - It's true... I can't have casual sex, | I need to be in love. It has to be meaningful. | Is that so strange? I just came for the check. But... How could I have forgotten? - Maybe it wasn't you. | - Truly. You don't believe me? You want one? OK, why not? I wanted to say... I'm sorry | to tell you this now... but if I tell you later, | it will be... even more... It wouldn't be very... Anyway, I think it's better | if I tell you. I have a girlfriend. You are so cute. Well, how's she doing? - She's not here. | - I noticed. She's in the U. S. | for six months. How is it going? I had no news | for three weeks, but... the last time we talked, | she was OK. No news... for three weeks. Why don't you contact her? She's never home. Strange. But I'm not worried. | I trust her. - And you? | - Me... nothing. - Hi. | - How are you? - Fine. | - Why didn't you call first? When I called, you said tonight. Yes, but, now... sorry. Come in. He turns toward me and says, | "How could I forget? " It's funny, because at | the same time, I was thinking... "How could I remember? " - Here you go. 300. | - Thank you. - Here. | - Thank you. It's closing night. Every time I'm acting | for the last time... it's as if I'll never act again. Given my age, | it's likely to happen. What do we call a 40-year-old | unemployed actress? Redundant. It's not the same for you. | You have talent. Sure. What talent! What's going on, Clara? | Are you depressed, or what? Absolutely. I don't know what to think | about my life anymore. When you're 20, the uncertainty | and all that doesn't matter. You have hope and lots | of imagination, and then... But now I'm 40. And I'm at the same place, | worrying about my rent. As far as hope goes, | it's pathetic. I'm alone. I have | two days to procreate. Besides, I don't have | the father. I don't want to go through this, | to find somebody. It's too tiring. You were a bit pushy, abrupt. One has to be careful with | these people, you understand? - The way you deal with... | - What about it? Let's just say sometimes | you should be more diplomatic. I never do or say | the right thing. You're always correcting me. | It's like always being tested. - You're a pain in the ass. | - I'm thinking of the company. There are some constraints. Things to do and not to do. | I must remind you of them. - It's my job. | - I agree. I'm happy with you. You're competent, | no doubt about that. But why do you talk like | a government official? Can't you talk | like anyone else? No? What did I want to say? | See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. He's full of shit. They graduate from | the Polytechnique and think... I agree. - Want me to drive you home? | - No. Am I driving too fast? | I'm not even going 40. But I'm not feeling well. Your driving makes | me nervous, anyway. I'm honest, | I always tell the truth. Besides, it's dangerous | on these small streets. Imagine if a child crossed, | or a dog. Is this OK? Yes, now it's OK. Stop, Bruno! - You scared me! | - You almost hit it. What? Where? Poor bird! | Oh, poor little bird. He's shaking like a leaf. He's probably traumatized. | He's shaking like a leaf. We're in the middle of the road. Hello? Yes. Is this Mr. Castella? No, she's not available. She has her hands full. She's holding a bird | in her hands. A bird. She found it in the road. Because it... it wasn't well. All right. He said he'll be back | tonight at about 11:00. I wished myself to hear you | in this place. I'll hear no more. And so farewell forever. Forever... Ah, my Lord, | reflect how harsh... these cruel words fall | on a lover's ear. In a month, a year... how great our pain will be... with all the seas still | parting you from me? When the day dawns | and when the day will end... while Titus seeks | his Brnice in vain... and all day long | my never seeing you. But how deceived I am! Consoled of my departure | in advance... he bids my absent days | untold remain? These days so slow | will fly for him. I will not have | many days, Madame. My hope is soon | my sad renown... will tell you were beloved. You'll see that Titus | was unable to... If it's true, my Lord, | why separate? I talk not of a wedding now. Has Rome condemned me | not to see you more? Do you begrudge me | even the air you breathe? - What did I do in Act V? | - It was wonderful. - Wonderful, Clara. | - I never did it like that. More pins in my hair | than spectators. No, it was crowded. | It was perfect. - Should I roll one? | - That would be nice. Yes, come in. - Hello. | - Hello. Do you remember me? I know you, but... - The English lesson. | - Oh, yes. The funny methods. My niece acts. | She's not really good, but... - Who is she? | - Virginie Jerome. My niece. Virginie is very good. - She's a little... | - She's very good. I don't like theater, | but tonight... I can't stop crying. | That's stupid, but... it was so good tonight, | you were good. I saw the entire | second part, it was... These closing nights | are painful. - I don't like theater... | - Why did you come? But, actually, | it didn't seem like theater. Your acting is so... You were wonderful. | Absolutely wonderful. Tonight was magnificent, | just magnificent. You saw the scene with Phenice? Tonight there was... a grace, a magic... And Duclos was here. - He finally came? | - He positively adored it. He said he hadn't seen | a Brnice like that since... Thank you, my Clara, thank you. - He'll write you. See you. | - Yes, bye. You... you really are... perfect. Thank you. | Excuse me, I should change. Sorry. Sorry. - Good-bye. | - Good-bye. I've seen the show twice. Who is he? Shall we go, Mr. Castella? | What are we doing? Mr. Castella? What? Let's go. - Veh. | - The. - The. | - Vuh. - Vah. | - The. The. Ah! The. The. Yes, very good. The. The. The. Yes. OK. OK. The. The. The. That's OK. The weather is nice. The weather is nice. You're not hungry? No. I'm not hungry. What? I am not hungry. Me am hingry. Very low level... - What? | - Nothing. Nothing. Ah. Nothing. - Nothing. | - Nothing. - Nothing. | - Nothing! I was working | with a tough guy. His name was Turtle. | Chief Inspector Turtle. - Like a turtle? | - Yes. I liked the guy. A pain in | the neck, but I respected him. You don't meet a guy | like that every day. Anyway... We were after a client, | untouchable, see? Powerful. You look forward | to the moment you'll get him. In this business, you're always | happy to destroy a guy... who is above the law. - And then? | - And then... He was really above the law. We busted our asses for months, | and it was over in one day. Case over. | Everybody goes home. Go have fun somewhere else. The law... my ass! - So you guys resigned. | - I did. I did. - Turtle, he stayed? | - Yes. Turtle, he shut up. | Not a word. I'm going to bed. | I'm exhausted. - What time is your date? | - She should be arriving now. - It's the girl from the bar? | - Yeah. That's your way | of being in love? I don't see why not. You still | don't have news? No. Maybe she's like you. Maybe. - OK, I see. | - You don't see anything. - Hi. | - Oh, hi. - How are you? | - Fine. Franck, this is Manie. - Hi. | - Hi. - You want something to drink? | - Coffee and cream. May we have a coffee and cream? - So, you're the bodyguard? | - Yes. It's a cool job, isn't it? No, not really. - Oh, really? | - No. I'll leave you alone. Hello? Excuse me? Hello? You should go. | You don't have to wait. I know. Don't worry. - Excuse me, ma'am. | - Thank you. - Do you know Bruno well? | - No, not very well. We have sex every ten years. You have some free time, then. These cell phones are awful. I have to pick her up | at 7:00 a. m. Well... I have to get up at 6:00. I'll call you. - Sleep well. | - Bye. I'm upset, because she asked me | to take care of the decorating. It wasn't my idea. I did it because | she's your sister... and because the poor girl... Anyway... I find magnificent stuff, | and she never agrees. I told her to do it | or to let me do it. It's my profession, after all. She doesn't know what she wants. She has to live there. But considering that she asks | for professional help... which is good, | because she has no taste... why doesn't she listen | to my advice? I try to make her appreciate | beautiful things, and... she's totally closed-minded, | she turns against me. - You should talk to her. | - I won't. I won't interfere. Can I have a beer? Your son called. He didn't | receive the money order. Why do you say "your son"? | He's not yours? - It's a figure of speech. | - I sent it eight days ago. - He's in England, not in China. | - It must be the strike. - The strike? | - They said there's a strike. The strike ended a week ago. Tell me when something happens. I want a divorce. | I didn't want this. I don't even know | how it started. Who is she? Do I know her? It's Liz. Here you go. He told her he wants a divorce. Oh! That's it? He told her? He told her | he's sleeping with Liz? - How did she take it? | - She's heartbroken. She asked if it was because | they can't have children. So she went to see Palomino? It makes sense. | You don't want her to beg. Wait. - Why did you change it? | - It's over. They're kissing. Precisely! Put it back! What are you doing? You're eating chocolate | behind my back? I don't want to tempt you. Eat your chocolate normally! | What are you talking about? I do it for you. Put the extra-large one here. You think so? - I'm not sure. | - The ones at your place? It's difficult to imagine. | These things are so ugly. They sell like hot cakes. - Amazing! | - No, it makes sense. It's decorative | and not disturbing. People want | to continue to sleep. - This young man, here. | - Hello. - So you're taking over. | - You're the artist? Yes, that's me. It was a success. Happy? Very happy. I was lucky, | it went well. But it's a good gallery, | lots of passersby. - So you're a painter? | - Yes, so am I. There's a trick | for the lighting. - I can show you. | - No, it will be fine. Shall we go? Good-bye. I have my appointment | with "Moustache". This guy is so thick. You know what he did? He wanted to tip me. He added | 100 francs and said, "It's OK". I wanted to kill him. Good- bye. Example...yesterday... the sun was in the sky. Today, the weather | is not nice. - It rain. | - It is raining. It is raining. Like pissing cows. Are you acting again soon? No, not for the moment. What's the most difficult part? | The memorization? No. Definitely not. The hardest is to depend | on the other's desire. I don't understand. To depend on another's desire. I would have seen it | a third time. I can bring you the text. Nice. I could read | all your parts... In English, please. Ah, yes... it's, uh... it's nice. That's it. - You want some? | - Thank you. Ahh. Hello? Hi, Tomas. I'm working Friday night. If you want. | But 3:00 a. m. isn't convenient. No, it's not convenient. What about tomorrow? Yeah, noon is perfect. OK, bye. What were we saying? Nothing. | We weren't saying anything. Hello? What a surprise. How are you? Of course, I can see you. I have a green skirt | and a brown one. Yeah. I'll be here all day. OK. No problem. You want some? I don't need that. I don't either. I want it, it's different. Let's say I don't want it. If you want to marry me, | you'd better be nice. I'm not nice? Borderline. You're very popular. Ohh. Thank you. I prefer praline. Have you seen her apartment? It's perfect. - You can thank your brother. | - I did. Is everything all right | with Anglique? Yes. But I could have | done it alone. It's better this way. It helps you, | and she can practice a little. She's a decorator, | and she never works. Anglique does | very beautiful decorations. Their home is perfect. Hazelnut. Why does he say | that it's like praline? You must be happy, it came. Hell if I was! - You see, you were saying... | - I was wrong, I agree. What time is it now? We have plenty of time, | 45 minutes. I don't like to hurry. The station | is 400 yards away. Clara. Miss Devaux! Hi. Let me introduce my father, | Mr. Castella... and my sister, Beatrice. She's teaching me English, | but she's a great actress. - Actress? What's your name? | - You wouldn't know me. - I'm in theater. | - I never go to the theater. - What about television? | - No. - Do you work with celebrities? | - You're bothering her. No, but I'm in a hurry. - See you Thursday? | - See you Thursday. I didn't bother her, did I? She doesn't seem like | an actress. Is she really? Do you know a play | called "Brnice"? - Yes, of course. | - I didn't. So, how is she doing? Fine, fine. I'll finish it at home. - Sorry. I'm bothering you. | - I prefer to read it at home. Franck told me. | "You can kiss her good-bye", he said. He knew something was wrong. But I'm always so naive... - I didn't even tell him. | - Excuse me. Anyway, she doesn't say | it's over. She doesn't. | But it's as if she did. When you have sex with | someone else, it means... What does it mean? No, it's not the same. It's not the same for a man. A man can have sex | with whomever. It doesn't mean anything. I wasn't talking about you. No, no, but I think | you're wrong. For plenty of women, it doesn't | mean anything either. Really? - You just say that to be kind. | - No. On the other hand, she could | have kept that to herself. I don't see the point. She does what she wants, but... - How are you? | - Fine. - And you? | - Fine. Castella took so long tonight. I thought he would keep me | until 2:00 a.m. I'd like a beer. How about you? - I should go. | - Have a drink with your pal. I have to rest. | I'm picking her up at 8:00. - Just one last one and... | - That's better. - Are you OK? | - Yes. - Fine. | - Good. We had dates. | She wouldn't show up. Then she was crying, | feeding me all kind of bullshit. One day it was one thing, | the next day it was another. I really tried hard. I hung around for three years... I tried to understand, | I forgave everything. And each time | it was something new. And I fell for it. | I was in love. I got swindled for three years. But... what's the connection | with Bruno? He's kidding himself. He's trusting. Anyway, he's too trusting, | not only with women. He trusts everybody. | He's too kind. One day he's going to be really | disappointed, really hurt. She wrote. | So much the better. - Who's that? | - That's... That's a friend. | I'll be right back. Hi. Hold on. I'll be right back. Here you go. 500. - Thank you. | - Bye. I'm sorry. He couldn't | come at another time. - Why the long face? | - What about it? Should I burst into laughter | when you're selling this shit? This shit? - OK, I'm leaving. | - Really? I'd bother your clients. I'm not expecting anyone. | You're not bothering me. Don't you want... | a cup of coffee? Yogurt? I have some cookies, | if you want. Are you upset? You're not happy. No, I'm not happy. Give me a break. - You don't make a living? | - I have a normal job. - So do I. | - You must be kidding. A tobacco store, | that doesn't bother you? - No, that doesn't bother me. | - Or a bar? What do you mean? Alcohol is legal, | so are cigarettes. - What is this bullshit? | - Don't use that tone. Are alcohol and cigarettes | legal or not? Are alcohol and cigarettes | harmful or not? It's ten times worse. But you don't care. Your problem | is that it's illegal. Your arguments won't | help you in jail. Why? You'll turn me in? I'm out of here, | you're really... Tuesday. Tuesday. | At what time? - At five. | - No. From... From four to five. From four to five. | OK. Very well. I brought you the book. - Did you read it? | - I couldn't. I've read four pages, | the other ten pages. Then I stopped. | They weren't very good. I think they're wonderful. Really? I don't... You don't like them. | I know. Don't bother. I have to push myself to read. Then you will never read. | So what? Yes, it's true. I read your play three times. You're only going to read that? I also enjoyed the novel | you gave me afterwards. It's better here for | the classes, more pleasant. He doesn't get bored | doing nothing? That's his job. - You can go. | - I'm waiting for a friend. - We're going to the theater. | - You're going to the theater? - Flowers, sir? | - No, no. - Be nice. | - I told you no. What a pain. - That's no reason to... | - To what? To be unpleasant. | He's selling flowers. He's a human being. - Sir. | - That's my friend! - That's all right, Franck. | - Sorry. I'm sorry. - Who's that guy? | - Mr. Castella's bodyguard. The bodyguard... How funny. - Mr. Castella, Mr. Reichner. | - A pleasure. I hope he didn't frighten you. He surprised me. But I don't mind being touched | by such a handsome guy. Oh. What? He says he doesn't mind... It's really not important. You know that? Juanita Banana Juanita Banana! | Ha ha ha! Of course, I know it. What's that? You don't understand things | that are obvious to me. I only want to help you. | It's not for money. - You didn't want me to pay. | - I wasn't going to charge you. I don't know what to say. Every time I make a remark, | you get upset. - You can't bear my opinion. | - No, that's not it. It's not because | you interfere... but each time, | your suggestions are... - Are... | - Are what? Can't you see? Some things go together, | some don't. You have to be consistent. If you want to keep | the pigs, keep them. - What can I tell you? | - Mr. Castella called. He said you shouldn't wait. All right. We'll talk about it, OK? Let's go. We have | a million errands to run. What time is it? | Oh, my goodness! Flucky is coughing so much. I don't know why, it must be | the pollution. It's awful. And the little bird? | How is he doing, Mrs. Castella? He's dead. We should've gone to the vet. Oh, please. What a shitty play! | I'm appalled. He has nothing to say. Nothing to say? | Wait. He's the director... You remember his "Hamlet"? | A piece of shit. - I didn't see it. | - I know plenty of these idiots. How can you work like that? Did you read Dumont's article | when he destroyed him? - The Imaginary Invalid. | - Should be rendered invalid. Isn't that | your student up there? What's he doing here? Stop! He'll come over. He's really friendly. | Why shouldn't he come over? You're not the one | he'll talk to. I'm not up to it. How are you? | It was great, wasn't it? I enjoyed it. | I couldn't stop laughing. The one who plays the | Imaginary Invalid is so funny. - Is he that funny in real life? | - Yes, he is. - Let's eat something. | - Yes, let's go. We're getting a bite. I could come with you, | if you don't mind. It's only a bar. | You can eat, but... That's perfect, perfect. It goes like this. | The evening is over. They come back. The woman | goes into the bathroom. The man goes to bed. | The woman washes up. She puts on all her cold cream | for the night. When she's finished, | she goes to bed... they turn off the light... and in the darkness, after | three seconds of silence... the man says... "Don't you think | it smells like shit?" That's the best one yet. It's so subtle. I preferred the one before, | the one about vomit. It was funny. On that note, | I have one so funny... Maybe we should stop now. We're eating, and I've had | enough potty humor. I'm sorry. You're right. - Are you an actress? | - A wardrobe mistress. But I'm unemployed | at the moment. One is often unemployed | in this business. That's what I tell myself | every morning. It's the same for you. | You don't work very much. It's sad not being able to work. The jokes are over. | Satisfied? Yes, I'm thrilled. Why don't you do a comedy? That would be a good thing. People want to take | their minds off things... forget their troubles. For example, | tonight it was full. But last time it was half empty. But, you know, I enjoyed it. But, generally, that's what | people prefer...a funny play. In my opinion, | you should do a comedy. You always play drama, | and then you wonder. All right, I'm going to try it. | I'll do comedy. I think he'll enjoy | your next show. With Ibsen, | he'll die Iaughing. - Who? With whom? | - Ibsen. Ibsen is funny. Very funny, he's a kind | of Norwegian comic. Another very funny one | is Strindberg. I prefer Ibsen. | He's the funniest. When Nora leaves Elmer at | the end of "A Doll's House"... We're just joking. | Ibsen really isn't funny. That's enough, now. Did I tell you | the Iatest one about Valerie? - Aren't you bored? | - I'm OK. I'm just watching. - Who's that guy at the bar? | - A customer. - Want a drink? | - My boss needs you. Shit! You scared me. - What are you doing? | - Nothing. Watching you sleep. And was it interesting? It was nice. You were talking. Really? What was I saying? You were saying, | "Mommy, Mommy... I'm scared". - I don't believe you. | - I'm kidding. You were saying... "The chick hasn't been born | who'll get me". That's more likely. You were very nice with | your customer earlier. It's good for business. You don't make | your living in that bar. Why do you say that? No reason. I work two or three nights. | I don't make much. That's why you're a dealer. True. I don't do it for fun. - Do you sell powder, too? | - Grass and hash. You're giving me a lecture? You sound like my father. Fathers sometimes | speak the truth. Not mine. Your boss is a good guy. He doesn't seem mean. He's dense. They made fun of him all night. | He didn't even realize it. But he isn't mean. Why "poor guy"? He put himself | in this situation. He comes, it's one stupid thing | after another, and in the end... he picks up the tab. - It's not my fault. | - OK, OK. It's the truth. - When will you have some hash? | - I can't reach my guy. I'll try someone else. I'll have to stop sometime. | I can't do this all my life. What else would you like to do? Have children. Tend to my home, cook. It's tempting. Where is Schafter? Schafter? She didn't come. She has other fish to fry. - And Orvitz? | - He won't come. - You don't know that. | - Are you kidding? He doesn't show for paintings. - Where does he go, then? | - Conceptual Art. - Congratulations. | - Thank you. Paintings are outdated for them. I saw Zaramba earlier. Yes, he came because of Oraki. Anyway, it's crowded. I heard good things. - Hi, Valerie. | - Hi. Look, Isabelle and Ccile. You OK? Need some help? - I'm OK. You want something? | - How about a little white wine? A little bit for me, also. I'm glad that I invited him. - Has he seen you? | - No, not yet. He's seen me now. Can I have some champagne? What are you doing here? It's your friend Antoine. | He, uh... He told me to stop by. Hi. Hi. How are you? It's wine. Thank you. | There is an incredible... In French, in French. It's so crowded! | Is he a well-known painter? Ah, Mr. Castella. | How do you Iike it? I haven't looked yet. Who is he? Do you know him? He's good-looking. I don't like mustaches, anyway. Good afternoon. | Congratulations. I haven't looked yet, | but it's crowded. I didn't know this city | had so many people. Are you happy? He's not happy? He is, but a lot of journalists | didn't show up. They said they were coming | and didn't? What a bunch of fags. Fags? What do you mean? You know, fags. You mean ass-fuckers | like my friends and I? Antoine, you want something? | What about you, Benoit? If you want to marry me, | you'd better be nice. Yeah. OK. See you tonight. Bye. - You're getting married? | - No. It's an inside joke. - Did Manie tell you? | - What? About my... my girlfriend? Well, what is it? You were right. | She's seeing someone. - Shit. | - You were right. - You knew it, unlike others... | - That's too bad. Yep. - She doesn't say it's over. | - Of course not. When I told Manie... she told me that a woman could | have sex with a guy without... - Just like us. | - Really, Manie said that? Manie says what she wants. I think she's taking | advantage of you. You're in a weird situation. I know it all too well. - Good-bye. | - Say hi to Louis. I'm sorry for | what I said earlier. Did I upset you? - You didn't find it appalling? | - It's not important. It's just a figure of speech. | I spoke without thinking. Yes, that's the problem. I bought a painting. | The one in the corner. The little... Why are you smiling? - You didn't have to. | - That's not it. I like it, | that's why I bought it. I looked at them all, | and I liked that one. Hi. Sorry I'm late. No problem. | Take it easy. - Want some tea? | - Yes, please. Thank you. So, where were we? You were supposed | to write a few lines? I have it here. Are you ready? Yes, please. I was alone. I was alone in the rain... and there was clouds | in my brain. Oh, a poem... good. Yes. Should I start over? I was alone in the rain... and there was clouds | in my brain. Then she arrived with the sun... and my life becomed fun. Became. ... became fun. Her voice is like a song. Her eyes are so, so strong. When I look at this woman... my heart gets certain. She teach me English... but that is not | the only thing she teach. - Well? | - Mmm. You're progressing. - I checked a dictionary. | - Good. A few mistakes, but... You understood? - Whom I'm talking about. | - Yes, I think so. Yes, I understood. Should we correct it or go back | to the irregular verbs? Dunno. I'm sorry. | There's nothing I can say. You write me a poem, | it's very sweet... but, unfortunately... | I don't share your feelings... so we should move on, | you understand? - You understand? | - Yes. Would you mind | if we stopped now? Not at all. I'd prefer it. Are you going | to stay here long? Dunno. It's getting chilly. What is it? Did you notice anything? What do you mean? I shaved my mustache. Oh, yes, it's true. | I hadn't noticed. I didn't see that | you shaved your mustache. Nobody does. - How's it going? | - They're gone. They waited until 5:30 and left. "They" who? - Oh, the Iranians. | - Yes, the Iranians! I rescheduled for | the same time tomorrow. - You treat people like dirt! | - OK, OK. We've worked | on this contract for a month! Contract aside, you're absent | even when you're here. We can't work like this. Everything bores you except | for your English classes. Mr. Castella, everyone | must take responsibility. I can't do it all. I've had it up to here with you! Don't use that tone with me. You think you're a hotshot | with your diplomas. That's enough! | I'll be on time tomorrow! You have anything else to say? No. So... when do we get married? Whenever you want. When my contract is over, then. OK. - I'm kidding, you know. | - Me too. After that, we go on vacation. | A little honeymoon. Yes, of course. | A little honeymoon. Then you move in here. - No, no. You'll follow me. | - Where? - It depends. Here and there. | - Really? What do I do while you work? Take care of the house, | the kids, the cooking? Is it so degrading? You do it then. I'll work. | You take care of the house. It's not degrading. No one can order you around. Why do you say that? - Nobody steps on your toes. | - Should I let them? No, you're right. Don't let them. But you seem | to think the opposite. When will you be done? In a week or 10 days. | When they sign. I'm going to make some pasta. Think about my proposal | for the plant. Good- bye. Thank you. Good-bye. You're already home? You shouldn't drink, honey. | Alcohol is sugar. Who put that there? - What's that thing? | - It's a painting. I just bought it. You bought that? But, why? I like it. I find it nice. It's awful. You won't | leave that here, I hope. Anglique... I like that painting. I can't get used to your face. | You look so weird. Why don't you sit down? But what's going on? | What's the matter? Aren't you well? No. - But, why? | - I don't know. - You want a cookie? | - No. I'm sorry. Did he hurt you? - It's OK. | - He just nipped you, right? It's funny that | you never got along. I didn't know I had | to befriend a dog... in order not to be bitten. Do you like animals? I like people better. You don't think animals | have a heart? I just said I prefer people. I don't always. Well... - The fabrics are really nice. | - Very nice. - So you're happy? | - Very. - You won't need me to... | - No, it's fine, I assure you. OK... - What did she say? | - She wants to settle there. Now it's really over. - What a stupid letter I sent. | - What letter? I wrote her a letter saying... "I'm not mad. Don't worry, | it happens to everyone". - What's wrong with that? | - It was stupid! She used me. I'm so naive. Moreno was right. Forget tonight. Castella | is making me work overtime. He wants to go out. Something new. - 18 X 9. | - That's big. The front wall. | He already did a few sketches. He has two or three | very good ideas. - Hi. | - You can come to the studio. We can bring them to the plant. | You decide. - What do you prefer? | - I don't know. - We can come to the plant. | - OK. Ccile? Sorry, Clara, but... What would be good | about the corrugated iron... I waited for you, Mr. Castella. Really? I... I'm overworked | right now, and... I can't take classes anymore. - You could have told me. | - I forgot. I have too much work. | I'll pay you what I owe. Why are you stopping? | It's a shame. Why is it a shame? Because you were progressing. Want to see the menu? No, thank you. I have to go. What are you doing? - I'd like to walk by myself. | - Don't. No, it's OK. We can't leave you | alone in the streets. You start like this, | you end up a doormat. - That's absurd. | - He'll hold it against you. The moment always comes. I should keep my mouth | shut, obviously. - Things would go much better. | - Then he's an idiot. Don't do that, | just be more diplomatic. She won't change. | He must be mature. I'm always at his throat. | She's right. I should let go of a few things, | ignore them sometimes. But he's so conservative | that I can't help myself. And I can't refrain | from seeing him, so... Why do I always fall | for that type? It's so complex, shit! - You cleaned up, Manie? | - Yeah. What are you doing now? Nothing special. How about a drink | somewhere else? OK. See you tomorrow. Bye, Valerie. That girl over there isn't bad. Go tell her that | I'll buy her a drink. - She doesn't want it. | - Why not? She didn't say. It depends if you'd | rather have a metallic panel... above the entrance, for example. The entire surface, | I'm not sure... What I'm not sure about is if | I want to have it glued on. I don't know if you want to have | it just above the entrance... or if you want just this part... I don't want the entire front... I'd like it large, | as you mentioned. OK. 24 francs, please. - I'll take this. | - 31.50. It's true. But I don't think | they're all like that. You're kidding. They're all very nice, | they promise the moon... but in the end, these assholes | just think about their money. - The rest just sells papers. | - What do you do? - What do you mean? | - What do you do? You sit back | and spectate, it's easy. You abandon everything, | then you criticize. Change the world, | since you're so pure. I'll get it. - Yes? | - Is Manie in? Nobody's home. | You know what time it is? - She told me to stop by. | - She made a mistake. What were you saying? Where is it? - What? | - The painting. Did you move it? It didn't look good. | I'll put it somewhere else. Where? I don't know. | I'll think about it. Listen. | That painting is... very odd. - Let me watch my show, honey. | - I like it. - Could I watch this? | - Why did you remove it? I didn't like it. - It doesn't go. | - I don't care! I didn't choose one thing | in this house. For once I like something, | and I can't have it? Do you think I'm happy | in this candy dish? I can't stand these pink walls | and these birdies any longer. Where's Moreno? He's not home. Let's try at Manie's. | He should be there. Manie? Who's she? I'll smash his face in, OK? How are you? Aah! Fuck! It's every night now. Yeah. But he's not well. Stop! - Are you OK, Mr. Castella? | - Yeah. Yeah? They broke in | and took everything. - Does it sting? | - Not at all. Didn't you have | a mustache before? Yes. Finally. Nobody's noticed. Except my wife... who thinks that I look weird. No, I like it. Is Clara a friend of yours? She didn't notice. She told you | I made a fool of myself? When? Oh, yes, the other night, | having dinner at the bar. No. I made a fool of myself then? No, I thought... I don't know. | What happened? - My... my declaration. | - Of what? I... I... - She didn't tell you? | - She didn't say a thing. - A declaration of... | - Pardon? I wrote her a... - Does it hurt? | - Yeah. It's OK. It will go away. I hope so. Excuse me. I've got to go. - You're leaving now? | - Yes. - Could you tell Mait? | - Yes. I'll leave this here. - See you tomorrow. | - Bye. Blue is very nice here. Very nice... because blue is... - This is the one I really want. | - OK. Yes, Mrs. Rousset... our Head of PR, | thinks so also, and... Sylvie, come see a second. We won't tell her a thing. | Sit down, please. - Do we agree on this one? | - Yes, this is much brighter. - Truly. | - Yes, yes, truly. - Have you been waiting long? | - Just five minutes. I was with Castella. | It took longer than expected. You're always with Castella. What are you doing with him? We have a project together. | We need to discuss things. You found a gold mine. | That's nice. Mostly for Benoit. He won't | have to worry for a while. That doesn't bother you? Not at all. | Why should I be bothered? Perhaps I have | too many scruples. And I don't? You're taking advantage of him. | It makes me uneasy. Absolutely not. | What are you talking about? He enjoys Benoit's work | and wants a fresco. - Where's the problem? | - Antoine, you know what I mean. Don't tell me that | Castella enjoys Benoit's work. Castella doesn't know anything. He's spending his money... and you make him believe | that you're friends. I don't make him believe that. | I'm cordial, that's all. He doesn't know anything, | but he likes his painting. What can I do? Why am I on trial here? - Was the fresco his idea? | - No, but... - I want some coffee. And you? | - Coffee. How are you? Guess who was in my bathroom | for an hour yesterday. - Castella. | - Of course. - Why "of course"? | - No reason. We talked about him. It was interesting. | I was touched. What was he doing | in your bathroom? You're not doing well, | Mr. Castella. Neither am I. I'm not well either. Really? It's tough. - Want to talk about it? | - No. No, I'd rather not. Franck. Yes, sir. - Are you OK? | - I was thinking. We sign in two days. - Very good. | - Yes, it's good. - So you'll be finished here. | - That's what we decided. Good. It must have been | very boring for you. It was Weber's decision, | because of the insurance. It wasn't really necessary. Except the other night, | but you weren't there. - I'm sorry, Mr. Castella. | - No, don't worry about it. I could get mugged | all year round. But thank you. You haven't slept much | because of me. - I'll give you a bonus. | - It was my job. Besides, it's not | the first time... - Hi. | - Hi. - Could I talk to you? | - Yes. - Pardon me. | - Sure. - Want to sit down? | - No, thank you. I don't have an appointment. It won't take long. | But something is bothering me. I feel like it's... my fault. I know that you intend | to purchase... an expensive painting, | a fresco for your entrance. It's none of my business... but since I introduced you | to these people, I... I'm uneasy. | I feel responsible. To be plain, I feel like | you're... let's say... you're being taken advantage of. I talked to Antoine. Even if he says the opposite, | I really think... he's taking advantage... | of your feelings for me. I'm not sure I understand. Why do you say that | he's taking advantage of me? I like these paintings, | and I buy them, that's all. What's the problem? All right, then. Is that why you came here? Yes. And why did you think | I was buying them? You thought it was | to please you? Is that it? To make a good impression? I don't know. Maybe. You didn't imagine for a minute | that I could... like them? Is that what you think of me? Don't worry. I like them. Believe it or not, | it's not to win you over. Your liking me is not even | conceivable, I understood that. It's the kind of thing | that even I can understand. - See you Monday. | - Remember, 10:00 a. m. sharp. - Don't worry. I'll be there. | - Oh, here. I wanted to give you | my letter of resignation. Really? - You want to leave? | - Yes. I'm not a good match for you. I thought about it thoroughly | and didn't find a solution. I don't think the situation will | change, in spite of my efforts. You decided from the start that | I don't belong to your world. You say I talk like | a government official. It's true, it's my background. That's how I was educated. I tried to change. | I did all I could to please you. But let's face it... I failed. So... I think it would be better | for me to leave. Well... see you Monday. Weber. That doesn't suit me very well. - Would you think about it? | - I did. - That's why I talked to you. | - It's too bad, because... I was mistaken. I thought you despised me. I'm sorry if I hurt you. I didn't mean to. You don't want to | think about it... before making your decision? He's staying at a hotel? No, at the plant. Flucky is happy. He doesn't understand | nastiness or hypocrisy. He's content running everywhere. He's happy. He doesn't bother a soul | or know how ugly the world is. The world is what it is. | We deal with it. I don't want to. It's too disgusting, too awful. | I'm not interested. You should move to Disneyland. The former Minister... Nicolas Sauvageon, | is in police custody. With us is Inspector Turtle, | who made the arrest. Turn that off. - Wait just a second. | - Please, Bruno, turn that off. He was a member of | the government from 1995... - Thank you, Mr. Castella. | - Good-bye, thank you. So... - Not going to say good-bye? | - Are you kidding? - Good-byes are stupid. | - Yeah, they're a pain. I wanted to ask you, | what was the name of the guy... you could never... Wasn't his name Sauvageon? You haven't read the paper? Look. It's your buddy Turtle | who arrested him. A good guy. | He was right to stay. Yeah. OK. So long, Bruno. | Take care of yourself. - Yeah, you too, Franck. | - OK. Bye. Hi, Camille. How are you? Who's here, Camille? It's Anglique. Come in. - He left me. | - Yes, I know. - You know? | - He came by the other night. Really? You're seeing each other again? - You changed everything. | - No. - Just a little bit. | - It's nice like this. How is it? | Not too tight? Provided I don't breathe. - And now? | - Now it's fine. Antoine...he's picking me up. | Want to have dinner with us? No. I'm seeing Fred tonight. It's strange, you know, | I would have never guessed it. We had nothing in common. It's incredible how | we can misjudge people. I could have missed him. - Are you sure it's OK? | - Yes, it fits. I knew it was going | to finish late. We came home | at 5:00 a. m., smashed. I slept 2 hours maximum. I have a headache. Do you know | if Castella is coming? - Castella? Where to? | - To the opening. - How would I know? | - You could have talked. No, I didn't say a thing. We're not going to have him | on our backs all the time. Why? You were afraid | that I invited him? I invited him. So, you saw her? | Yes, she's coming. You must stay, Mr. Laforgues, | or she'll have to leave alone. True. Thank you very much, | Madame. I will therefore stay. Very well. | I will talk to the maid. Elliot, this matter, this | question about the future... will it be the subject | of your lecture? Yes, that is what | I heard at the bookstore. You would give a series | of lectures. Yes. | Don't hold it against me. Of course, I understand | that it upsets you. It's not good for her | to see us doing this. Madame Estelle, | you'll Iive at Aunt Julie's. I'll come every night. | We'll work there. She shot herself in the head. Can you imagine? Lord have mercy. | This isn't a proper thing to do. Bravo! Here we go. We cut on the third at the end. The third time.
