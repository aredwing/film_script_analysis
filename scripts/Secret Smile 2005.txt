Er... champagne. I'll definitely fall over now! Thank you very much. So, what do you say? Come on. Yeah. Come on. Let's go this way. The last time I did this, I was nine. - Really? - Yeah. And it was a pretty good birthday. And I didn't cry... - Oooh! - Oh, are you OK? DAVID: No, no. Hello. Hi. Are you a friend of David's? No, I hardly know him. What about you? I've known him for a while. How well do you know him? Oh, erm... no, we're just friends. Oh, OK. Good. Glad to hear it. Cos... you're not right for him. Oh, really? And how do you know? I can just tell. I think you need someone... ...taller. Erm... l'm just gonna myself get a drink. Where's the bedroom? Bloody boots off! - Oh, Jesus! - That was erm... - It was, yeah! Maybe you should erm... just go now. You know, just walk out the door, and I don't even get to know your name. Maybe I should. On the other hand... - Good morning. - Morning. I've never done that before. What? Taken a complete stranger home with me. Thanks. Well... l'm glad you experimented with me. Erm... how long have you lived here? Oh, I know. Long enough to put up shelves. - I've got to get to work. - Yeah, I've got to head off, too. - What's your name, by the way? Brendan. Brendan Block. Pleased to meet you. - Morning, guvnor. - Morning. Make 'em look the same all the way along. - Yes, OK, but... - There's Nick, look. Hiya. - It's looking good. - You could get another room in here. - Oi! No, he won't. - No, I like what she's done. Thank you. Did you get the plans for the kitchen layout? - Yep. - And the specifications for the floor? Yes. - Are we still on budget? - Of course. I bet you've been on the phone to David, checking up on me. I might have given him a quick call. Brendan Block. 30. An entrepreneur. Well, I set up a dotcom business with a mate from university. - Really? - Mm. Flogged it recently. Right. Da-da-da! Chicken a la olive oil. From the Miranda Cotton book of very fast food. - That looks great, Mirrie. - Thanks. - So, you're 30 as well? - Mmm. Erm... an architect. Er... you know David through your friend Laura. You've got one brother, one sister. You got more out of him than I did. Well, he's a bit pissed off with me, but all's fair in love and war. You're single at the moment... because nobody's been good enough for you That's one way of putting it. Relationships are a leap of faith. Don't you think? Suppose so, yeah Maybe it's time you jumped. WORKMAN: Do me a favour! They're not real, are they? Look at the size of them. In your dreams. God, Troy, don't do that! - You're putting on make-up! - Why aren't you at school? Study day. Hey, I bought lunch. I got some crisps. I couldn't remember which sort you like, so I got quite a lot. And then I got some healthy stuff, but I got quite a bit of it, because... I'm so sorry, but I'm going out. - What, for lunch? - Yeah. Oh. OK. Well, I'll take it back. Do you think they'll let me? I haven't got the receipt. Well, don't worry. Take it home and have it later. Shit! I had it. Maybe I dropped it on the floor on the way over. I'm so crap. Is any of that going spare? Cos I'm bloody starving. - Yeah! - Come and eat with us, then. - You don't mind, boys, do you? - No, it's fine, mate. - What have you got there? - Loads of stuff. - Cakes and some biscuits. - Dig in, boys. Mick... Thank you. Sorry I'm late. No, it's fine. It's just that I haven't got much time now. I have been waiting half an hour. Well, we can always leave it. No, no, I was just worried that you weren't going to come. I've been thinking about you all morning. Have you? Have you been thinking about me? Erm... what are you drinking? - It's shoddy. Look at that. - Yeah, I'll get it sorted. Why has this been replastered? Well, the fella wasn't very happy with it, so he's done it again. Oh, what? Look at all this! Look, you worry too much. It's a building site. Mick, that is unacceptable. Tell me it's not gonna stay like that. Of course not. I'll get a chippie to sort it tomorrow. - Today. - Today. We're behind. That's the wrong light fitting. That's the one they delivered. - Did no-one check the order sheet? - Well, somebody must have done. I don't believe it! Oh, Mick, did you phone the banks? Oh, shit. I'll do it first thing in the morning. OK, brilliant. - See you tomorrow. - Yeah, have a good night. See you. Hello? Hiya, babe. Do you want some wine? How did you get in? I took the spare keys this morning. You didn't ask. I'm here all the time. I don't see the problem. It's not a problem. It's just... I prefer to know if you're coming. Point taken. I won't do it again. Erm... I put your shelves up. Thanks. I've got to go out. Erm... I'm seeing Troy tonight. All right, sweetheart. I'll just hang out here. - That's my diary. - Oh, come on! - It's private. - From when you were 18! It's still private. We shouldn't have secrets from each other. It was in a drawer in my desk. You must have been through everything. How long have you been here? Look, if it had been recent or something, then I wouldn't have touched it. The thought of you as a horny teenager! - Brendan! - All right, sorry. Let me take you out to dinner. - I'm going out with Troy. - Mirrie... My name's not Mirrie! It's Miranda. Look... I think you should go. Go where? I don't want to see you any more. - That's ridiculous. - I mean it. - It's special, what we have. - We've known each other for ten days. Miranda, I love you. Just go. You bitch. So, you've been leading me on, just like you did with your sister's boyfriend. "Michael kissed me today. Kerry's Michael. We did it on Kerry's bed..." Just piss off! - If I go now, I'll never come back. - I think I'll survive. - Kerry, hiya. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. You look lovely. Thanks. Ooh! Drinking at lunch time? Er... yeah, well, I thought: Why not? Well, I think I'll join you. Are you all right? Er... yeah, fine. Why shouldn't I be? No reason. You just sounded a bit anxious on the phone. Oh, er... - Anyway, cheers. - Cheers. So, how's things with you? Fine. Just really busy. I've nearly finished work on this property, and the guy I work with, Nick, he's really nice, actually. He's developing loads of other stuff, so I just hope some more work comes out of it. - That would be great. - Yeah. Erm... I er... well... I have a new boyfriend. - Wow! That's brilliant! - Yeah, it's about time, isn't it? No. It's just really good that you've found someone. It's... it's just that it's a bit difficult. - Oh, no, is he married? - Oh, no, no, I'm... Oh, God, I'm just so mad about him, and you have loads of boyfriends. - I wouldn't do this, otherwise. - Do what? You know him. He's an ex of yours. - Of mine? - Yeah. And he told me how upset you were when he split with you. God, I just feel dreadful about it, but this is important to me, really important. - Not Jez? - Er... no, no. Kerry, it's not Chris, is it? He's a real tosser. Oh, no. It's... it's Brendan. - What? - Brendan Block. Hello, Mirrie. Hi. Bit of a surprise for you? Yeah. Well... here's to friends and family. I mean, if you think of the number of people who live in London, what are the chances of us bumping into each other? So, I was in the park... Excuse me. Can she have a steak knife, please? I was in the park, and I was jogging, and it was raining. And I recognised her straightaway from the photo in your flat. It was strange. He came up to me and said, "Are you Kerry Cotton?" Amazing. And we walked, and we talked... Thank you. And we didn't stop, even though we were both soaking. And then we got to my flat, and... I invited him up... which, you know, I'd never normally do, but... it just felt so right. Oh, I met your mum and dad. They were great. And Troy. There you go, sweetheart. You two - you're like two peas in a pod! Why did you never introduce me? It's amazing. You are being so good about this. I said she would be. Are you sure this is OK? Cos when Brendan told me about you, I didn't want to go on with it, but he reassured me that you'd be fine about it. - How long have you known each other? - Three weeks. Thank you. And I'm happy, Miranda. I'm really happy. Good. I'm glad. What are you doing? Are you playing with her to get at me? Sounds very self-centred. If by "her" you mean Kerry... I'm in love with her. Not everything revolves around you, you know Don't hurt her. Why would I? - All right, babe? - Yeah. - Thanks for lunch. - Look, we'll leave you to it. - Good to see you. You too. Take care. - Hello? - It's Laura Am I seeing you later? Hi. Yeah, I'll be there. Drink up, ladies. Got a party to go to. - Oh, thank you. Cheers. - Cheers. Did you know instantly that Tony was the one? God knows. I can't remember. Maybe he isn't. - Oh, sorry. - Thank you. - Come on, drink up. - Put me down! Come on, Miranda. It's gonna be good. - No. Yeah, you might meet someone. No, thank you. - You're pissed already! - Me? You're kidding! - Bye. Have a good time. - Bye. - Oh, bloody hell! - Breakfast! You frightened the life out of me! It's only 6:30. I wanted to make it before you woke up, but the shop wouldn't let me in till the papers came. - Do you want coffee? - Yes, please. Have you got anything to put the sugar in? There is one there. Look there. - The coffee machine's not working. - It is. It's not. You've done what you did to Mum's microwave. It's not broken! Do you think the eggs will be all right? Yep. Cos sometimes there's bad eggs in a good packet of eggs. No, they're fine. I'm gonna make you the best cup of coffee you've had. I love cooking in your kitchen. It's great. Eh, it's nearly ready Now? Oh, wow! Look at that - There you go. - Whoops. Quick, quick. There we go. God, that looks lovely. - Lemon? - Yes, please. - Sugar? - Yes, please. Smells great. Have you got a fork? - I've got a knife. - Mmm! That is delicious. You're not just saying that? You say it to Mum a lot. I know, but Mum gets stroppy otherwise. Are you ready? - Yeah. - Smile... and go. Excellent. Action shot. Miranda... Mm-hm? I thought you were asleep. I'm making us spaghetti Bolognese. Can I come and live here now? Mum and Dad's is so cramped. I hate that bloody lodger. We, [inaudible] and we'll see Maybe we get somewhere together Mum's into everything I do. You're the only one who doesn't irritate me. - You said it was just us. I'll see who it is. Hi it's Nick I'm sorry to disturb you but I've got the finalised electrics spec Oh, sure. Come up. Hi. I'm sorry. I was just passing by. No, come in. No, that's great. Erm... this is my brother, Troy. Hey. I thought you might like to look at them. You're the expert. Thanks. Can I get you a drink or anything? Erm... yeah. Miranda, are we gonna eat or what? TV: - exactly why that should change anything - It just does Erm... maybe another time? OK, that would be nice. Well, leave these with me, and we can talk about them on Monday. OK. See you. - Sorry about that. It's just... - Oh, don't worry. Hey, he's a teenager. Troy! - New boyfriend? - No, he's a client. Brendan says pain's a gift as well as a curse. He had a breakdown. Did you know? No. He says therapists are no good. He did exercise. - Yeah, well, you know. - Everyone's different. Have you been seeing him a lot, then? Yeah, he's gonna take me jogging. Jogging? You're not into jogging. Brendan says he hurt you. Did he? No. - Hi, Mum! - Hello, darling! - How was he? - Up and down. But isn't it wonderful about Kerry? Brendan's marvellous. Things haven't always been easy for her. Don't spoil it. - What would I do? - All right, Mum? Hi. You look lovely, as always. They're in the garden. I'll be in the kitchen. BRENDAN: That isn't always best, Kerry, as you well know. Hey, Brendan! All right, Troy? Over here. Come on, Kerry. Show us what you can do. Ah, hello, darling! Ah, mwah! Now, are you all right about all of this? Because, if you're not, I'll chuck him out of the house! I'm fine, but thanks, anyway. To be honest, I'd rather like to. He's so damn hearty. - OK, everyone! Salad's up. - Oh, darling, that's lovely. - Marcia, that looks sensational! - Thank you, Brendan. KERRY: Oh, Mum, they look great. Come on, Kerry. Now everyone's here, let's do it. Oh, no. Gather round, all ye Cottons. We've got an announcement to make. And I think we should get it over with, and then we can get totally plastered. I know that we're only five weeks into this whirlwind romance, and some might think that's a bit speedy. But all I can say is, when you know, you know. Erm... so, without further ado... Last night I took Kerry out to dinner, and I regret to say, I caused a bit of a sensation before the dessert! Erm... I knelt down beside her, and I asked Kerry to marry me. And I am delighted to report... that she said yes. DAD: Oh, goodness! What a surprise! MUM: Oh, sweetheart! - Well done, Brendan! Well done. - I'm so pleased! - I know beers are normal for barbecues, but this is a bit special, so... champagne all round. I'll get some glasses. - Hi. - Are you all right? - She hardly knows him. None of you do. - He's been round here a lot. But he's showing his good side. I don't think he's a nice man. DAD: Darling, where are you going? - He's lovely to Kerry. Do you like him? I think he's great. Come on, Miranda. Give Kerry a break. OK. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Did you turn the meat on the barbecue? No, you never said. Whoa! - Congratulations, Brendan. - Thank you. Oh... You know, it's funny - when I made the announcement, I was looking at your mouth. Why? It's beautiful, and I was thinking: "I've come into that mouth." What did you say? KERRY: Brendan, Mum wants a photograph. OK. MUM: Come on, everybody let's have a pate, before we sit down Come on, Derek. Leave them. They'll be fine. They can't get any blacker! Come on, Miranda! DAD: Family photo. - Sweetheart! - Miranda, come and join us. That's lovely. And cheese. It's a nice street. Miss De Silva. Hi, I'm Kerry. We spoke on the phone. And this is my sister, Miranda. I brought her along. You don't mind? - Can I just have a look round? - Yeah, sure. - OK. Well, shall we start here? - This is the front room. - So, what do you think? - I like it. It's got great potential. Yeah. I'm just not sure, with the amount of work you'd have to do, and the cost, that it's worth it. You could do the work. Oh, Miranda, it would mean so much to me. If I use my savings and sell my little place, I could buy it. Isn't Brendan going halves with you? Oh, the mortgage company won't give him the money - just cos he's not working. - Is he looking for a job? - Yeah, course he is. Aren't you going a bit fast? You hardly know him. - I see. - What? You can't stand it that, for once, I've got something you want. But you'll find another boyfriend. You always do. - It's not that. - OK, then, what is it? You've known him for six weeks. You're selling your flat. You're engaged. When you know, you know. I just wish you'd be happy for me. - Hi. - Hi, babe. - Do you want a drink? - Yeah. Have you got any cash on you? Erm... Hi, Kerry. It's me. Sorry about today. I'm really happy for you. Hi, Kerry. It's me. Erm... I'm sorry about today, and... if you buy the flat, I'll do the work. I'm really happy for you. Oh, for God's sake. KERRY: Hi Sorry we're not in to take your call Please leave us a message and we'll get back to you Bye - Hi, Kerry. It's me. I'm really sorry about today, and er... if you buy the place, I'd love to do the work for you. I'm really happy for you. Bye. NICK: It's come together well. - Thanks. No, seriously, you've done a great job Well, they could still mess it up. They've got time. 'We've just exchanged on a new property Have you? Congratulations. What is it? It's an old people's home. Gonna turn it into flats. - Oh. - Gonna need an architect. Seriously? Well, where's the site boundary on this one? It goes round here. The garden's about two-thirds of an acre. - That's huge. - Yeah, yeah. That's exciting. Hang on. I want to show you something on here. Is it something like that? - Is this something you've done before? - Yeah. Hey, I didn't get the impression he liked me very much. Oh, it's not you. Erm... he's not very well. He's erm... he's a manic-depressive, and he tried to kill himself a year and a half ago. Now he's on these drugs, which kind of even him out, but he's still a bit up and down. Oh, sorry. That... that must have been awful. - Mmm Erm... no, I'll leave that. BRENDAN: Hi Mirrie Just ringing to say I love the flat It's really sweet of you to say you'd work on it Thank you You have a nice evening - Do your friends call you Mirrie? - No. It's just my brother-in-law to be. He does it to wind me up. - He's doing a good job. - Yeah, he is. Oh, he's so annoying. Anyway... Look, I was thinking something open-plan like that. Or were you thinking more conventional? And I'll er... get these over to you tomorrow. Oh, right, yeah. - Thanks for a nice night. Erm... Well, I'll call you. - OK, yeah. - Right, bye. Aargh! Come on. We'll just see if she's in. I hope she's all right with this. Of course she'll be all right, babe. Hello? Miranda, it's Brendan and Kerry. Can we come up? Sure, yeah. - Hi. - Hi. We were just in the area and thought we'd pop in. Oh, you've moved the sofa. I liked it where it was. Well, I didn't. I'm sorry - I'm in a hurry. Is there something I can help you with? Kerry's got a favour to ask haven't you? Er... yeah. The thing is, if it's not too much trouble, what we were hoping was... Come on. Spit it out. Anyone would think you were frightened of Miranda. Can Brendan and I come and live here for a bit? I mean, we wouldn't be here for long. We'd be no trouble. We would go to Mum and Dad's, but with Troy there and the lodger, there's no room. We'll be quiet as mice. You won't know we're here. What's wrong with your flat? Oh, I know. It's ridiculous. Why have they got nowhere to live? Well, Kerry's sold her flat, and they haven't exchanged on the one they're buying. And he's so tight, he doesn't want to pay rent, so he's bullied her into this. - So, why is he so awful? - Don't you listen? He chucked Miranda... - He didn't chuck me. - Whatever. He's a loser. Who? Not me, I hope. My God! What happened? I got mugged last night. - Shit! Are you all right? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry. This is Laura. This is Tony. Yeah, it was in the underpass, just coming back from your place. I was just about to reach the platform, when someone... Anyway, I'm much more interested in your gossip. Who's the loser, and who chucked who? I'll er... get a round in. You want a drink, mate? Er... yeah, lager. Cheers. We were talking about Miranda's sister. Have you met her? No. And her boyfriend. They're going to stay with Miranda. - Did he take anything? - Just my wallet. Did you see his face? So, what the problem with them staying? My flat's tiny. I don't want them there. - Miranda doesn't like Brendan. - I gathered that. - Why? - Oh, I used to go out with him for a bit. - Go out with him? - Yeah. And now he's marrying her sister. - It's a good punchline, isn't it? - Yeah. One of the best. So how long were you together, you and this Brendan? Oh, only about 10 days. - What's wrong with him? - Everything. Wow! Ooh, it's lovely. What a great view. Yeah, it's not bad. - Can I get you anything? - No, I'm all right, thanks. That'll do it. If you start unpacking, I'll let her know we're here. OK. Hi, Miranda. We're here. - Yeah Come up - OK. - There's the last two bags. - Is that it? Yeah. I'll go and lock the car. So, how are we going to do this? Do what? Just put your stuff wherever. Oh, look. That's the same stuff you used to have on your bed. Do you know, I'm the only person who can compare you and Kerry... in every way. Well, apart from that other guy when you where 18. What was he called? Mike, wasn't it? Yeah. You're right to let Kerry stay. You owe her big time. - Look who I found on the way up. - Troy, help your mother. Surprise. We got wine. We got food. I'm sorry. I've arranged to go out. But... come on in. Make yourselves at home. Right. In the kitchen. Come on, guys. Oh, Miranda, darling. Let me get you another drink. Oh, I won't actually. I'm going to go now. Er... well, Nick rang while you were getting ready. - Change of plan. - What? Why didn't you tell me? - You should have told us. - Yeah, invited the new man for dinner. What? He should be here any minute. Hi. Come in. - I'm sorry about this. - No, don't worry. - Erm... you've already met Troy. - Hi. And this is Derek and Marcia, my mum and dad. - Hi, Nick. Nice to meet you. - Hello, Nick. And my sister Kerry and Brendan. Hi. That's a nasty bruise you got there. Been beating him up again, Mirrie? Thought you got over that. Oh, Nick, mate. Let me get you a drink. Oh, thanks. Yeah, smells nice. Yeah, bit more haute cuisine than you normally get here. Oh, that's not fair. She never pretended she could cook. Miranda Cotton bakes very fast food - There you go, Nick. Excuse me. BRENDAN: Mirrie, I'm sorry. Come on. We're all family. - Well, cheers, mate. - Cheers. Cheers. Thanks, gorgeous. Oh, I love you. - See you soon. - See you, Dad. Oh. Give me a call. DAD: What's the matter? Why did she behave like that? MUM: It's a bit difficult having Brendan and Nick. And she hates being called Mirrie. - See you. - Thanks. Good night. Brendan, get out! I'm having a bath. Sssh! - Kerry will hear. - So what? You don't want her to find us like this. I know you, Miranda. You're so like me, it's like looking in a mirror. No, I'm not. Nick's not right for you. You hurt him, didn't you? Forget about him. Get out! Forget about him. See you in the morning. Mum's driving me nuts. Just because I stopped seeing Robert. Why? - He's no good. No therapists are. - I thought you liked him. He brings me down. I can work my own way through it. I've got a book about visualisation. Brendan lent it to me. I'm going to the cinema. Do you want to come with me? - With Nick? - No, with Laura, actually. - Why don't you like Nick? - Because he's an arsehole. You didn't give him a chance. - Cos he's not good enough for you. - Really? - Who gave you that idea? - No-one. Oh, my God! It's clean. He's done everything, Miranda. He's moved your stuff. I told you he cared. And you had a problem with him. He's even tidied your office stuff. - See? I told you he was nice. - Hello. - Hi. It's me. Hiya, come up. Took some stuff to Oxfam - worse for wear. Hope you don't mind. He's thrown away half my clothes! I don't believe it! - He did it for you. - What?! Clutter's bad for your energy. Especially in corners. That's just stupid! Oh, I'm sorry. - Enjoy your film. - Hi, Troy. What? - What's going on? - Look, he's thrown away half my clothes! - Oh, my God! - I can't believe he's been through my stuff! Oh! Look, there's only a week till they move out. Just hang on in. I don't know if I can. Have you got some wine? Yes. - Can we have some? - Unless he's bloody well cleared it up! Thanks for letting me stay. Hey, don't worry. - Hello. - Hi it's Troy Oh, hi. Look, I'm really sorry about today. - Can we still hang out tomorrow? - Brendan and I going to the gym - What? All day? - Yeah Well, can we do it another day? - I suppose so - OK. Lots of love. - Yeah Bye - Bye. - What is he playing at? - What do you mean? Oh! Brendan. He's with Troy all the time now. Well, that's good, isn't it? At least someone is. - Thanks. Cheers. - Cheers. You know when you were mugged? I think it was him. What? Oh, come on. He can be really violent. It can't have been him. - Why not? - Because... the police found my wallet on an 18-year-old kid called Neil. But that doesn't prove anything. Oh! # Every day # I think of you - Yeah, that's nice. - Yeah? And where would we play this? Erm... we could use it either when we're signing the register - or when people come in to... - Hi. - Hi. Hi, I thought you were staying at Nick's tonight? - Is everything all right between you two? - Yeah. We just decided not every night, you know. Sure. Erm... actually, since you're here, we... we've got a favour to ask. Is there any chance we could stay longer? The flat we put the offer in for has fallen through. What happened? It was too small. You mean, you withdrew your offer? Please, Miranda. It would really help us out. It would just be a couple of weeks. - But it'll take months. - We'll try and find something as soon as we can. Thanks, Miranda. You've been really good about this. - Do you want a cup of tea or anything? - No, thanks. OK. I'll leave you be. - You look crap. - Thanks. I can't get much sleep. My flat's like Piccadilly bloody Circus! - So, how's everything going? - It's all sorted. Don't worry. Good. - How you are doing with pics for Nick's refurb? - I've had no time. - You know he has a shortlist of other architects? - No. - He has. - Shit! - I'm sorry. I won't be a second. Hello? Miranda, have you seen Troy? No, not for a couple of days. Why? His bed hasn't been slept in. He's just disappeared. What's going on? Dad, what's happening? He didn't turn up at school. And his teacher says he's been more and more withdrawn. So, I'm going to look for him. Now, listen, take care of your mother. See you in a bit. MUM: Yes, he has seemed more depressed than usual. And his teacher said the same this morning. That's fine. Keep it. We haven't been able to find them. They're not in their usual place. - Hi, I just saw Dad leave. - Does that make a difference? He's gone to look for him. Where's Brendan? He's out looking for Troy. - Is she all right? - Yes. All right. Thank you. Goodbye. - Oh! - What did they say? The police say that he does qualify as a missing person because of his medical condition. I just got the impression that they weren't going to take it seriously for about 24 hours. - Has he been taking his pills? - I can't find them! - When did you last see him? - I don't know. Oh, I'd better just go and get dressed. - I'll put the kettle on. - I'll come with you. No! No. No. BRENDAN: Here he is. Thank God! - Where have you been? - He was down by the river. What the hell were you doing there?! We've called the police. - You shouldn't have bothered. - We were worried about you. - He's all right. - I remember what it's like when you get into one of those places in your head. You just want to go somewhere... safe. And, you know, you want to retreat. So, I thought, retrace his steps. Mum says you've been feeling low. Why didn't you ring me? - Don't want to bore you. - You wouldn't have. - Thank you. - Promise you'll call me next time, all right? - Thank you so much. - Troy? And we've been down there... down by the river quite a lot. We've had some nice chats down there so I thought... - Why didn't you go to school? - What's the point? I don't learn anything. - You can't just not go. - I think he should have a rest now. - Talk about this later. - I'm not tired. Yeah, you are. Come on. See you later. - Marcia, have you got any sleeping pills? - They're in the bathroom. KERRY: I'll get them. DAD: Drink? - Yes, please. Has Troy been seeing a lot of Brendan? Well, they go running together. Fishing together. - They're even talking about rowing. - Rowing. Oh, how ridiculous! He doesn't have to drag Troy with him. He's doing this for Troy. Troy's been very low the last week or so. And Brendan reckons the exercise is good. I think he's seeing too much of him. I think Troy's vulnerable. I don't think you're being objective. - What do you mean? - Brendan is a good influence. If he's kind enough to take the pressure off us... ...l'm not going to stop him. - Come on. I heard what you said to your dad! - Well, you shouldn't eavesdrop. - You shouldn't bad-mouth me. So, prove me wrong. Don't mess with Troy's head. - Hello? - Oh hi Nick It's me - How you doing? - I was wondering if I could come round. Erm - Is that all right? - I've got a bit of an early start in the morning. Oh, OK. Fine. Forget it. - Goodbye. - OK. All right. Bye. Kerry's made a late supper. I think after such a mad day we all need to calm down a bit. I'm not hungry, thanks. Miranda. Are you sulking? No, I'm reading. What is it? "First Love, Last Rites." - Sounds sexy. - It isn't. Do you remember? We used to make love like this. Brendan! Supper, you... Kerry Kerry! Kerry! Shit! Kerry! - Stay away from me. - Leave her, Miranda. - Leave me alone! - Kerry, come on! Come on Leave me alone. Get off me! Sweetheart, come on! Why is this happening to me?! - You always had a crush on her! - Calm down! Kerry, are you all right? You tell anyone what happened and I will never forgive you. You fucking bully! BRENDAN: Oh, babe! Oh, sweetheart. It's fine. You can stay in the little room. - You sure? - Yeah, we'll just have to move the suitcase. And change the sheets. Can you pick up the sheets from the dry cleaners? - Have you got enough money? - Should have. Yeah. Will you be back about seven? - Seven, seven-thirty. - You'll have a bed about seven-thirty. - I'll bring a bottle of wine back, if you like. - Thanks. I would stay at Nick's. It's just, he's being a bit weird. Look, stay as long as you like, all right? I'd better get going. - See you later. - Er... excuse me. - You're so demanding. See you. - See you. - Oh, he's so lovely. - Wedding invitation. Kerry's younger than me. She's known Brendan three months. If Tony doesn't get his act together... You can't compare Tony and Brendan. - What is it about this bloke? - We don't know anything about him. Don't know anything about his friends, his family. The people he works with. I think he lies about everything. - So, you going on anywhere after this? - Yeah. I didn't know Brendan was going to come to my party. He just sort of turned up, like he always does. Why didn't you warn me about him when I rang you before? What? After you'd had sex with him? Look, I'm not the person you should be talking to. There's a guy called Harry Vermont. He's a friend of my ex-wife's. He was in business with Brendan for a couple of years. Miranda Cotton? - How do you do? - Hi. Good to meet you. - Would you like a drink? - So I met this guy Harry this afternoon - What do you want? - Erm... could I have a white wine, please? And a pint of lager, please. And he was telling me that he set up this business with Brendan. Brendan promised him start-up capital and contacts. And none of it materialised. He had relationships with his secretaries. And one of them even pressed charges against him for sexual harassment. It's terrible. Anyway, he said the straw that broke the camel's back, was the... - Cheers. - Cheers. Thanks. ...was the fact that he was fiddling the accounts. He ended up having to buy him out of the business. And he's still paying off the debts now. Anyway, and yesterday I met this guy David, who is a friend of mine, and he was at university with Brendan. He was telling me loads of stuff. And here's the thing. Oh, another round. Same again? Can I get the same again, please? David also told me this story about when they were at university. A tutor failed Brendan on a paper and Brendan found this guy's car and he stuffed the car full of dog shit all night till the car was full. - Can you imagine? - I don't want to. Thanks. - Where are you going? - I can't keep doing this. - We shouldn't see each other any more. - What do you mean? Don't pretend you don't know. You're in love with Brendan. No, I'm not. - Why do you keep on talking about him? - I don't. Look, he's marrying your sister. It's tough on you. - But don't use me as a substitute. - I'm not! We can't work together so I'll have to give the job to someone else. - Sorry, Miranda. - Can we not talk about this? Nick, wait! I've been trying to talk to you for weeks. - How's it going, Derek? - All right, darling? Beef's lovely. - Is it still bleeding, Derek? - Yes. And so am I. MUM: Ah, vegetables. - There you are. - Oh, lovely. Lovely. Yorkshire pudding? Mother had a deflation moment. Oh, dear. - It's too warm. - Oh, this is lovely. The whole family together. - We should take some photos later. - Yes, good idea. Pass the horse radish. Thanks. - How's the flat-hunting going, Kerry? - Yeah, it's good. We almost found somewhere a couple of days ago, but it didn't have an office. Brendan needs an office. An office. Good idea. I wish I had one here. You could get one if you turfed that lodger out. - Yeah, I bloody hate him. - I can't afford to do that. What would Brendan need an office for, anyway? Well, he wants the option of working from home. Right. Yeah. It gives you flexibility and there are tax breaks. Exactly. It saves you money. I'm telling you. You see, as far as I can make out, Brendan's not good at business. I was talking to your ex-partner, Harry Vermont. He was telling me about your business skills. How you lived it up on the company credit card. How one of the secretaries filed a suit against you for sexual harassment. And how you fiddled the company accounts. That's how good your business skills are. He's still paying the debts off. - Miranda. - He's lying to us, Mum. - I don't like this. - Lying's a bit of a strong word. - Well, that's what it is. - I don't like this. It's all right, Troy, mate. He doesn't have the business background he said he did. What else is he lying about? What sort of person is he? Don't you want to know? One of his tutors failed him on a paper and he found the car and stuffed dog shit through the window. Just stop it! - You never did get over me, did you, Mirrie? - That's another lie! Harry Vermont had a breakdown. It was him that nearly ruined the business. He's not a well man. You shouldn't believe anything he might tell you. Bollocks! It's all lies! This is more about what sort of person you are. Sorry, babe. I hadn't wanted to go into this but... It's you who's the liar, isn't it, Miranda? You deceived Kerry. You slept with her first boyfriend, Mike. - What? - Behind her back. You had sex with him in Kerry's bedroom on her bed. You bitch! Oh, my God! I think you should leave. Hi. Thanks for coming. Do you want a drink? Whatever you've got to say, just hurry up. I'm really sorry. We were all so young. You knew how crazy I was about him. I feel shit about it. I always have. I really am sorry. I didn't tell you because I didn't want to hurt you. It was so long ago. What did Brendan have to gain by bringing it up now? I don't believe you. Right from the beginning, you tried to ruin it between me and him. Pretending it was you who chucked him. - But I did. - Lying in bed, trying to seduce him like some bitch on heat, getting whatever she wants. Kerry, he hit you. Yeah. Because of you. You can still leave him. I don't want to leave him. Then maybe it's best if you move out of the flat. What are you doing? What do you want? We'll be gone by tomorrow night. Your mother has found somewhere we can house-sit. She's very cut up about all this. Leave me alone, Brendan. You still don't get it, do you? What? It's me who makes the rules. Nothing's over till I say. You know, when we finished, you didn't even say sorry. I had nothing to be sorry about. - Hello? - Hi it's me - I need to talk to you - Sure. Of course. Can you come to the flat? - Hello? - Hi. Hiya. You all right? Yeah. Yeah. - They're not still moving out, are they? - Yes, they are. Haven't you made up? - He promised he would try. - Is that what you wanted to talk about? - Yeah. - It's just not as simple as that. It could be if you just let it be. But it's got nothing to do with you. Don't worry about it. He's right. You don't give a shit about me! - If you did, you'd have made friends. - Troy, that's not true. You're just pretending. It's one big game to you, like he said. - Just don't believe what Brendan says. - Why not? He tells the truth. No, he doesn't. You've got to rely on yourself. What's the point? The pain of keeping going. I did it for you to make you happy. - But if you don't care... - Of course I care. I love you, Troy. We all do. No! You just think I'm a burden weighing you down. Don't be silly. Come on. I'll make us a cup of tea and we'll sit and talk. You know what? Now they're moving out, you can come and stay here. Troy? Troy. What are you doing? Troy? Troy... - Can I go with him? - No, let me explain what happens now. We'll go in a police car. They'll take him away and we'll follow. - Yeah, but I want to stay with him. - No, that's not the way it works. I'm sorry, love. It's all right. We're going with him. Just in this car, OK? - But I should be with him. - No, it's OK. It's OK DAD: Dear Troy we love you so much. We always have... and we always will. We will spend the rest of our lives asking ourselves where we went wrong. What we did wrong. We are sorry for anything that may have contributed to your unhappiness with this life. When he talked about his hopes, his fears... ...his anxieties and his disappointments, I recognised the voice of myself as a young man, trying to make sense of an apparently lunatic world. I feel guilty. Not because I could have done any more, but because I know how painful it gets to be locked into that private world. I lived through it and somehow was tossed out the other side. Troy wasn't so lucky. Derek and Marcia did all they possibly could. No parents ever loved so much or so selflessly. His sister, Kerry, the most caring and compassionate woman that I have ever met, would have done anything for him. But in the end, not even Miranda, the sister to whom he was so close, could save him. We will miss your energy, your passions, your obsessions... ...and we will miss your life. Our lives are more worthwhile, fuller, more important, and simply better, because they have been touched by yours. Thank you, Troy. Let me get this straight. You're suggesting that your brother-in-law to be had some kind of bad influence on Troy? Yes. In my flat, before... before, he said, "He's right, you don't give a shit about us." I mean, why would he say that? He was so wound up as if someone had been on at him, goading him. According to Mr Block, they were in the park in the morning. Sounds harmless. Yeah, but what were they talking about? I mean, what was he saying to him? He was living in your flat with your sister, yes? Yeah. Is there some kind of issue between you and Mr Block? Look, I don't like him very much, but you know. "Troy actively sought me out. He wanted to be with me." Must have been hard. Your brother's feeling bad. Instead of talking to you, he confides in this bloke that you don't like. I believe Brendan encouraged Troy to stop seeing his therapist, to stop taking his medication. Maybe he did. Maybe he was trying to help and got it wrong. It was Troy's decision. Miranda, Troy was a completely different person when he was depressed. He loved you. He wouldn't have wanted to hurt you. Well, he's dead now. How do we know what he would have wanted? There are some things we'll never understand. Troy doing what he did is one of them. Yeah. He's right. You are drinking too much. Who's right? Brendan rang me. He said you went to your mum's and were sloshed. What business is it of his? He's worried about you. Everybody is, Miranda. - What? - He wants to make peace. Hang on a minute. - How did he get your phone number? - I gave it to him at the funeral. - Whose side are you on? - Look, it's not a question of sides. Come on. I know he's been a complete prick in the past, I do, but he's genuinely cut up about Troy. Nothing is genuine with Brendan. If you keep this feud up, you won't see your family. Because he's wormed his way in. The one good thing that could come out of this is that you and Brendan can make friends. What's the matter with you? Nothing. - You're quite an unforgiving person. - No, I'm not. If you and I fell out, I hope we'd make up. Of course we would. I just want my friend back. I'm here. It's sort of a wedding present. Not really... Anyway. - Thank you. - Thanks, Mirrie. Oh, they're lovely. - A bit grown-up. - They're perfect. They'll look great in our new home... wherever it is. Actually, because of everything, we've cancelled the church wedding. We'll have it at the registry office. And then just have family and friends back here. Top-ups all round, I think. Thank you. - Can I help at all? - I think I'm all right, thanks. - Let me do that. - Sure. Thanks for being so good with my parents. It's the least I can do. They've been very good to me. Kerry looks better. Yeah. She still misses him. We all do. I just wanted to say er... ...sorry things have been so difficult between us. Water under the bridge. There was a time when I was a bit messed up about you, but I've moved on. I'm glad to hear it. You're getting married. Oh, and we need a witness for the registry office. Kerry thought you'd say no. No, I'll do it. I'd love to. That's great. Thank you. Miranda's going to be our witness. Really? Fantastic. Thank you. Pleasure. Well... here's to the wedding. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hello. What's the matter? The wedding's off. What? Brendan phoned five minutes ago. Oh, my God. - Where's Kerry? - In the garden. Oh, Mum. Oh, Kerry. I'm so sorry. I bet you must be pleased. You finally got what you wanted. Don't be silly. What a laugh, to dump me on my wedding day. No doubt you encouraged them, didn't you? What are you talking about? Oh, God, don't pretend you don't know. It's Laura. What? Brendan's left me for Laura. Laura, what the fuck is going on? Get in the house. I'll deal with this. - Laura, have you any idea how upset Kerry is? - Just go away. Get off. I don't understand. What's happening? Miranda... Laura and I got married this morning. Now go home - Got you a pint. - Thanks. Oh, Tony. I just don't believe it. Came back from work and er... ...she told me to pack my stuff. I thought she was joking. Did you have any idea? She went out a lot. Said she was with you. - Your bloody Brendan. - He's not my Brendan. He's promised her everything she thinks she wants. Marriage and kids. Everything I was too crap to offer her. Oh, Tony, I'm so sorry. They're off on honeymoon now. Her mum told me. What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do without her? Oh... I did a conservatory for her sister. Now she wants one the same, only bigger. It's not a huge job, but we need an architect to take us through the planning. - I could put your name forward. - Absolutely. How quick could you get the plans? I can draw them up in three weeks, ready to submit. I'll speak to her this afternoon, if you like. - Brilliant. Thanks. Sorry. Hello? Hello Miranda it's Laura Hello. I know what I did was really awful and I'm very sorry but erm I do need to see you Can you meet me tonight at the Drayton about eight o'clock? - OK. - Thanks What are you doing here? Where's Laura? Don't try to break up my marriage. It's pathetic. - She rang me. - And vindictive. Why isn't she here? She doesn't want to see you. We're happy. She's happy. Like Kerry was until you dumped her. - Like Troy was until he met you. - Hey. I loved your brother. - Bullshit. You just used him to get at me. - I did all I could for him and your sister. But I couldn't keep supporting your family. I have to think of myself for once, my needs. You never think of anyone else. You couldn't if you tried. You'd know. - Because you're the same. - I'm not like you. Poor wee Mirrie. You got more than you bargained for when you met me, didn't you? Sad, isn't it, how things have gone downhill for you? You've lost so much. While I seem to have done rather well. Might as well stay for a drink. Join me? Are you paying with your money or Laura's? Laura's, of course. It's wonderful. I've got you to thank for that. It's because of you we met. At Troy's funeral. I've got you to thank for so much. Anyone fancy a game of pool? That was a fluke. The person you are calling is Hello? Laura? Hello? Laura? Hello? OK. Laura? Laura? Hello? Laura? Pretend we didn't see that. - You're getting your money's worth. - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. We've um... We've got the post-mortem results back. It was definitely an accident. There are no marks on her body, no sign of ligatures or a struggle of any sort. I don't believe it. She was very drunk. She must have run a bath, got in and passed out. Well, couldn't he have got her drunk and put her in the bath? No. There's no forensic evidence of that. But he's very clever. Maybe he didn't leave any! My DI gave him a right going over. She's sure he's telling the truth. So, that's it? You're just not going to do anything again? Well, what do you want me to do? I don't know, but you could at least talk to him, couldn't you? It's not my call. You've got to do something. All right. I'll erm... I'll get another statement. - Check the forensic evidence again. - I'll get a statement. - It doesn't make any sense. - I'll ring you, OK? OK. We have come here today to remember before God our sister Laura. To give thanks for her life, to commend her to God, our merciful redeemer and judge, to commit her body to be buried, and to comfort one another in our grief. We have entrusted our sister Laura to God's mercy and we now commit her body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our frail bodies, that they may be conformed to his glorious body. I'm leaving London. VICAR: Was buried and rose again for us. Everywhere I go, I see her face. VICAR: Amen. I can't bear it any more. I have to find out what happened. I have to. What's it matter now? Miranda we havent seen you for ages Why don't you come back with us now? I can't. I've got things I've got to do. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I'll see you soon. Thanks for coming. - Take care of yourself. - And you. Brentford Police Station Can I speak to Rob Pryor, please? Who's calling? Miranda Cotton I'm afraid Constable Pryor's not here at the moment Do you know when he'll be back? Maybe this afternoon - Will you ask him to give me a call? - Yes OK. Bye. Rob! Rob! Erm... just hold on. I'll be a minute. Hi. Have you spoken to him? You didn't tell me you had a past history with him. - I don't. - You went out with him. For ten days. You tried to break up his relationship with your sister. You lied about him to his mates. No, I didn't. When I interviewed him, he immediately knew it was you pushing me. Luckily, he agreed not to tell my DI. There's nothing to tell. Yes, there is. I was out of line and he knew it. He said you'd do anything to get at him. It's not true. Witnesses at the Drayton say you hit him so hard he could have pressed charges. - For fuck's sake! - You're being paranoid. I could charge you with wasting police time. I've just been to Laura's funeral. She was my best friend. I'm sorry. I just wanna know what happened. Rob! Hi, it's Mick. You still all right for that meeting tomorrow? Erm... I can't do tomorrow. You said you'd have the plans by this week Can you give me a few more days? No, she's going away on holiday Friday. Look, I'm sorry, Mick. I've just had a lot on. Dont worry I'll just have to reschedule the job. Sorry Miranda Selling up? That's a shame. I thought you loved the place. - Or can't you afford it any more? - What do you want? Laura's stuff. It's all yours. I sold the house. Got a fair whack for it. So I'm off. You've got what you wanted. You'll never have to see me any more. You bastard! Best for everyone. For me, and for you. Bye, Mirrie. I'll always remember you. As always it's about money You may fool other people Brendan but you don't fool me It is with great sadness I have to say I no longer consider you a brother Try to move on as I have Susan Breathe out. Breathe out. That should do the trick. Did you work in Scotland before you set up down here? I've been here for years. Trained here, the lot. You've still got the accent, though. - Is it Edinburgh? - No. It's not Glasgow, anyway. I'm from the back of beyond. Loch Etive. I went on holiday to Loch Etive. You didn't? You know Kirkdale Cross, the Oban side? Kirkdale Cross? I don't think so. See? I told you. Middle of nowhere, where nothing happens and nobody goes. But you got out. I certainly did. That should do the trick. Any problems, give me a phone. And your brother? He got out too? He did. Look, I know Brendan. I wanted to talk to you about him. Look, I don't know where he is. We don't see each other. Whatever it is you want from him, I'd let it drop. Why? He's better left to his own devices. You owe me 40 pounds. And your parents? Does he still see them? They died. Oh, I'm sorry. How? A fire. It was an accident. I don't want to talk about it. Leave the money on the side. He's called Lawrence and he's a junior hospital manager. And he's nice. Excellent. Are you seeing anyone? Not at the moment, no. - Thanks. - How's work? Fine, thanks, yeah. Are you all right? It's just, you haven't seen Mum and Dad for ages. - Or me. - Sorry. Yeah, I'm fine. Erm... Did you know that Brendan's parents died in a fire? His mum died of cancer, he told me. He was lying. - I know because I met his sister. - He didn't have a sister. She's called Susan. She's an osteopath. Why are you doing this? If I can get a better picture of his past, then maybe the police would listen. When he walked out, I wanted to blame you, Laura, but... ...really, it was him. He never loved me. He used me to get at you, and... if someone can do that, they can do anything. Please, Miranda. Just leave it. - What are you doing here? - What do you think? How did you get in? Your friendly estate agent showed me round. You still keep the spare key in the same place. How did you find out about this? I met your sister. I had a bad back. Oh, very good. You keep your nose out of my business. Enough! Understand? I once fell for you, but you're not invulnerable. I have got a new life. I've got my own business now. People sit up when they see me. My girlfriend adores me. I will not let you ruin that. Understand? I walked away from you. Time that you walked away from me. - Bradley and Wren Property Agents - Hello? - Can I speak to John, please? - Whos calling? - Miranda Cotton. - One moment - Hi Miranda It's John - Hi. You know you showed a guy round earlier today? Well, he left a scarf here. Have you got a forwarding address for him? Yeah Just a second - It's 22 - Yeah? Crandale Gardens NW3 Yeah. Brilliant. Thank you. - OK - Cheers. Bye-bye. Oh, is she in? - Yes, she is. - Oh, thank you. Who are you? Oh... Oh, sorry. What are you doing in my flat? The door was open I'm Miranda. Miranda Cotton. See - Can you please leave? - I just wish someone had warned me. - He'll become possessive and jealous. - Get out. He doesn't tell the truth about anything, you have to understand. I know him. - I think he's a dangerous person. - Oh, is he? - Or are you just jealous? - Please listen to me. He used other people to get at me. Has he told you about Troy? - Yes. - What about Laura? Please listen to me. It's only me! I forgot my phone. Please. My God, you must have worked hard to find me. Poor wee Mirrie. When I think of what you used to be and what you are now. Get out. You won't get away with it again, Brendan. Get off me. Goodbye, Miranda. You all right, babe? Yeah. What did she say? Nothing. Just... ridiculous stuff. She's mad, isn't she? It's awful. Don't worry. I won't let it happen again. - But I've got to go. - Yeah. See you later, all right? Bye. I'm streaming with a cold. I walk into a health-food shop... It was so bad, he was talking like this. Can you get that, Mum, please? And then there's a vision of loveliness. Hello? Yeah. Bring it up. Top floor. Flat 8. Who is it, Mum? Delivery for you. We live nearby, so we bumped into each other that night in the pub. Yeah? It was odd. We got chatting, and then erm... Delivery for Miranda Cotton? - I'll take it. - I need to deliver it personally. Don't tell her I told you that. Who here is Miranda Cotton? I am. Thanks very much. We found out we lived round the corner from each other. Very strange. It's all right. Weird. Darling? Is everything all right? I don't believe it. What is it? Oh, I told you to leave him alone. If anyone should take out an injunction, it's me. He came in here and took the key. - What's happening? - Brendan's taking Miranda to court. You have, according to Mr Block, and he has witnesses, harassed him ceaselessly since he ended the relationship with you nine months ago. When he started a relationship with your sister, you caused such tension that he decided to break all ties with your family. - After his new wife died... - In suspicious circumstances. ...you slandered him to a police constable. Fearing for his safety, Mr Block moved. You discovered his new address, - forced entry upon Naomi Stone. - It wasn't like that. Did Miss Cotton intimidate you, Miss Stone? Yeah. Do you have any explanation? I just wanted to see if she was all right. I'll keep this injunction in place for six months. If you break it, it will be contempt of court, punishable by possible imprisonment. Thank you so much. Nor do I condone your behaviour, Mr Block. The court will review this case in six months. In the meantime, I hope to see neither of you here again. - Are you OK? - This is a nightmare. The bed was beautifully made. He'd pulled back the sheets, put a chocolate and a rose on it. The bathroom was all candlelit, with bubble bath. - How lovely is that? - All done by the time I got home. It was really sweet. - Is that yours? - Yeah. Hello? It's Naomi Hi, Naomi. I've been thinking We should talk Sure. When? Brendans out all morning Come over OK. Are you all right? What did she want? She wants me to go to their flat tomorrow morning. You can't. I mean... What if it's a trap? What if Brendan's there? You go anywhere near him, you could go to prison. No, I'll just have to be careful. She sounded really upset. Leave it. It's difficult, but I've moved on. So should you. I feel like I'm standing on a riverbank, watching someone drown. I can't do it. - Security - I'm here to see Naomi Stone, Flat 23. Right you are Hello? See you later. Hello? - Get out of there Miranda - What? Meet me at the end of the road She's made our life a misery. Well, we'll have a word with her, sir. - What the hell's going on? - Sorry. He made me call you. Well, get in! Look, you were right about him. Since the day you came, he completely changed. Last night, he locked me in the bathroom all night, just cos I talked to a mate on the phone. He says if I ever leave, he'll punish me the way he punished you. Does he hit you? Nothing that'll show. He's careful. I'm just so scared. I don't know what I'm going to do. Go to the police. They didn't believe you. They're not going to believe me. Anyway, he'll come after me. You know what he's like. Well, you'll have to go back there tonight, so he doesn't suspect anything - until we figure out where you can go. OK. Ooh! Where have you been? Someone called in sick. I had to cover. So, how did it go with Miranda? When we got here, she was gone. Maybe we should just leave it at that. You've got the court order. I doubt she'll come back again. Ow! Did you warn her? Of course not. Oh, could you get that, Kerry? Hello? Miranda? No, it's Kerry her sister Can I speak to Miranda? It's Naomi Stone. - Er... yeah, it's just we're sort of... - It's kind of urgent Hold on. Come on up. She's in the lounge. Are you all right? I know you told me to stay put, but he's got much worse. He's going through my e-mails, texts, everything. Oh, my God. Does he know you've gone? No, but he will when he gets home. - Can I stay here? - Sure. No. No, this is the first place he'll look. Can't you stay with your parents or?

Bye-bye. - Where's Naomi? - How should I know? She's not here. Don't be stupid. You've been in contact, haven't you? Comparing notes. Why would I do that? She tried to set me up. Here, have a drink. You want to lighten up, Brendan. You don't want to lose control. Cheers. So, where are you going to live? Erm... I'm going to stay with my mum and dad for a bit. No house, no job, no boyfriend. I'll survive. You said that when you chucked me out. Still here. Just. I was thinking on the way, do I regret meeting you or not? And do you? No. Although you have pushed me into some stuff I wouldn't normally do. Like what? You know. Do you remember that first night I came here? Do you remember? We couldn't get enough of each other. I remember. It was good, wasn't it? What are you doing here? What do you want? I came to say goodbye. Get off me! Oh, Mirrie... you don't mean that. Yes, I do. No! Get off! No! No! - Mirrie, sh! - Argh! No! - Sh-sh-sh! - Stop it! No! No! Yes! That's it. Sh! Sh! Stop it. Arrrgh! Mirrie! Go away! Go away! Get off me! Go away! Argh! I can't let you go, Miranda. Argh! Get away! Get away! Is there a lot there, Mick? No. Just some small stuff today. Taking it to her parents' place in Ealing. - Didn't finish till nine last night. - I had a late one, too. Miranda? She said she'd be here this morning. Blimey. Must have been some party. It's gone straight to voicemail. I suppose we'd better make a start. Just going for a quick piss. Shit. Oh, this is Naomi, a friend of Miranda's. Erm... you haven't heard from Miranda? She hasn't popped round? - That'll be her now. - Probably. She just said she'd call and she's not answering her phone. Mr Cotton. DC Rob Pryor. Do you remember me? We had a call from a Mr Mick Mason this morning. He had an arrangement to meet your daughter at her flat and she didn't turn up. Well, where is she? I mean, she was supposed to have moved her stuff out of the flat today. - She can't just have disappeared. - I'm sure there's no need to worry. - People go missing... - No, it's Brendan. Brendan? He told me last week that if I left him... ...he'd come after me. He'd know where I'd gone and he'd find us and kill us both. Morning, Rob. - Mr Brendan Block? - Yeah? I'm Detective Inspector Jean Holmes. May we come in? Brendan Block, I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Miranda Cotton. - Miranda? - You don't have to say anything, - but it may harm your defence... - What's happened? - That should do it. Can you do the bags? - Yeah, one by one. - Cuff him. - I need to speak to my lawyer. Hold your hands up, sir, please. Rob, what the fuck is going on here? Rob, will you sort out the interview room? Tell me when it's ready. I'll get the paperwork. Right. Let's get started, shall we? This interview is being taped at Brentford Police Station. The time is 17:10. Now, Mr Block, can you tell me what happened last night? - I went to her flat. - How did you get in? She let me in. She was moving out. I thought it would be friendly to say goodbye. We drank wine. Things progressed from there. What exactly do you mean by that? We had sex, which she instigated. Where? In her living room. I crashed out afterwards, I woke up, she was gone. Gone? She wasn't in the flat. Didn't you find that a bit strange? She's an unpredictable person. I got up and left. We found blood... on the carpet in the bathroom. A lot of it. Can you account for that? No. - Are you sure the sex was consensual? - Absolutely. Last night Miranda Cotton a 30-year-old architect - disappeared from her flat in Acton - I'll get it. - Police found blood stains and are currently questioning a man who visited her there last night Anyone who saw Miranda last night or who saw anything suspicious please ring this number Your call will be treated... This is Detective Inspector Jean Holmes. We have arrested Mr Brendan Block, but he is denying everything, saying he went round to see her, she let him in, they had sex, he left. Miranda would never have let him into her flat. She knew he was dangerous. - There's no sign of forced entry. - Well... He used to have a set of keys. Maybe he never gave them back. You lied. You've got keys to Miranda's flat. - No, I haven't. She let me in. - You let yourself in and raped her. No. You must feel awful. You meant to have sex with her, not kill her. We had consensual sex, which she instigated. You panicked, killed her, disposed of the body. Any jury would understand that. This is ridiculous. I was there, we had sex, I left. Officer... you have no body, no murder weapon, my client has no injuries consistent with a struggle. There is no case against him and he should be released. I'll be making these representations to the custody officer. Before I terminate this interview, have you anything further to add at this stage? Everything we have against Mr Block is circumstantial. There's no hard evidence that links him directly to any assault on Miranda or to her disappearance. There's no trace of her DNA in his flat or car. We have been through everything. I'm so sorry, but we've had to release him. How long were you going out with Miranda Cotton? We are not making a statement. We may be issuing a statement later in the day. We have nothing further to say. Did Naomi Stone know Miranda, Mr Block? - Good afternoon, Miss Stone. - Thanks. - Anything to go? - Not this week. - Bye, now. - Bye. I thought you'd left. Just getting the rest of my stuff. Oh, very supportive of you. Well, get it and piss off. Oh, thank God for that. I need some clean clothes. Jesus, it's disgusting in there. I haven't had a wash for two days. You might have hung these up. You look tense. Anything the matter? No, I'm just worried about Miranda. Oh, yeah? Silly bitch has probably killed herself. She never did get over me. I'm going to have a shower. Are you done? - Not yet. - Well, hurry up. Are you still here? Oh, for Christ's sake. Give it here. And don't come back. Hi, Chris. What have you got for me? What I've got is an ident match between the victim's DNA and the blood on those keys. OK. What else? Block's fingerprints are also on the keys. Great. Thank you, Chris. All rise. Would the foreman please stand? Mr Foreman, have you reached a verdict on which you are all agreed? Yes. On the count of murder, do you find the defendant, Brendan Block, guilty or not guilty? Guilty. Brendan Block, having watched you and listened to you during the course of this trial, it is plain that at no time has it crossed your mind that you have committed a terrible wrong. Because I didn't do it! A wrong you committed to satisfy your depraved lust, and your desire for vengeance on a young woman who had spurned you, and who then sought to protect another young woman from your unwanted attentions. What I propose to do now is pass a sentence on you of life imprisonment. It is quite clear that you represent an ongoing threat to women. And you will serve at least 22 years before you are even considered for parole Take him down. Marcia, here, have a look at this. Naomi. There's three tickets. There's... one for Kerry. Oh... What do you think? It's very sweet of her. Yes. It is. That's fine, thank you. Straight through. How long will you be staying in Australia? Thank you. What's the nature of your business in Australia? - Oh, dear. - I'm bushed. Me too Doesn't look like the way out. Departures and the shops. Must be up here. - We didn't miss her, did we? - No. Is that her? There. - There she is. - Hi! Naomi. Hello. - People go missing all the time. - No, it's Brendan. He told me last week that if I left him, he'd come after me. And hed find us and kill us both You lied to me. You've got a set of keys to Miranda's flat. No, I haven't. She let me in. How long will you be staying in Australia? Three weeks. What is the nature of your business in Australia? Vacation. No hard evidence links him to any assault on Miranda. There's no trace of her DNA in his flat or car. And you serve at least 22 years before you are even considered for parole Take him down Thanks, Naomi. Thanks. This is delicious. A great wine. Thank you. That's fine. Oh, I've missed you so much. Well, I'd just like to say... ...to my sister... ...who died and came back. Cheers. Cheers, everyone. Cheers. - Cheers. - I'll drink to that. Cheers. MARCIA: Thank you, Naomi. NAOMI: So, we'll have to get you a place here, won't we DEREK: No, I don't want to move here. Funnel-web spiders in your dunny... Come on. Hit it! Over here. Strike it. Come on.
