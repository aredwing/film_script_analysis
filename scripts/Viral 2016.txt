With concerns that chinese authorities may not be telling the whole story, American officials are tightening screenings at all points of entry to the United States. We'll hear about the political pressure around this issue later, but first, Julia... begins our coverage from Dallas. ...believed to be caused by a small, wormlike parasite, the public is calling the condition "worm flu." Symptoms include increased appetite, fever, bloody cough and, in some cases, seizure. While this is scary, it's not like the common cold. Worm flu can only be spread through the transmission of blood. Nevertheless, U.S. officials are on alert. President Barack Obama issued the following address this morning. We will continue to closely monitor the situation. We're also going to be working on protocols, to do additional passenger screening both at the source and here in the United States. All of these things make me confident that here in the United States, at least, we... the chances of an outbreak, of an epidemic here are extraordinarily low. You creepin'? -No. -Do you have food? -I don't know. Maybe. -Please? Yoink! -Help yourself. -I cannot stop eating today. I polished off a whole row of Double Stuf this morning. It's ridiculous. -Hey. -Hey, Evan. "Hey, Evan." -I didn't say it like that. -Yeah, you did, though. Seriously, you better step it up before you lose your, like, -new girl glow. -Really? How? Well, like, show some boob, like... -I don't have any boobs. -You don't. Maybe's, like, an ass guy. It's not that big of a deal. We're gonna be late, come on. God. God... Now, you supposed to be Little Miss Biology. Don't tell me you afraid of a dead frog. Get him, girl. God. It looks like it's throwing up -from its neck. -Come on. Em... do it. I can't do this. That is nasty. You know what helps me when I'm feeling squeamish? Gum. I'll leave it right there for you. Thanks. Gum. Lucifer? You and the devil on a first-name basis? Unfortunately, yes. Hey. Em... Thanks for getting me in trouble again. Calm down. Em, wait up. What? You're the bestest sister in the world. If that's the hand that just touched your vag, I'm gonna kill you. It was this one. Dude! All right, I'll see you. -Bye, Emma. -Hey. -So you're Stacey's sister. -Yep. I'm Emma. So... I am CJ. -I've heard about you. -That's tight. What happened to your foot? Yeah. I broke it. How'd you break it? Shark attack. It looked a little something like this. Come over later? -Yeah, I'll try. -All right. Emmalicious, stay vivacious. Thank you. Peace out. Real class act. Just mixing with the locals. You should try it sometime. -Hey! What's his name? -Evan, why? -Evan! -What are you doing? Be a good neighbor. Offer him a ride home. -Don't! -You want a ride? -Taking the bus. -Yeah, 's taking the bus. It's, like, the last stop. It's gonna take forever. We insist. Don't we, Em? Yeah. Of course. Why are you being such a bitch? 'Cause you don't have balls. I have balls. -Hey, Dad. -You guys ready? -Shotgun. -Hey. -Hey. -No way. Dad, we're giving Evan a ride home. -Hey, honey, you're on speakerphone. -Hi, kids! -Hi, Mom! -Hey, Mom. When are you coming back? I have a meeting in Kansas City tomorrow. -Hopefully, the day after. -I thought we were gonna finish unpacking this week. Please, Michael, let's not get into this right now. All right. Fine. I love you. -Gotta go. -Bye, Mom. Bye. You liking it? Here? Shadow Canyon? Yeah, I guess. It's different. From Berkeley? Yeah, I'll bet. You know, they say that moving is supposed to be the third most stressful life event, after death and divorce, so... Hey, Evan...! -Seriously? -Girls, stop it. -She kicked my seat. -Stop being a jerk. Well, mind your own business and maybe I won't have -to kick you. -You guys just cut it out, please. Seriously, why are you being a jerk? She's being a jerk. Just cut it out, all right? You are! Just leave me alone! Stacey... Hey, Mr. Toomey. Hey, Stacey. I'm Stacey; she's Emma. Shoot. It's gonna take me a couple of minutes to get all that down. Well, it's easy to remember. I'm the pretty one. Mr. Drakeford, thanks for the ride. Any time, Ev. Take care, bud. Bye, Emma. Bye. Hey, Evan? Tell your dad I put his pliers in the mailbox. It's not my dad, but okay. Alan? I can't find my car keys. Hey, there. I better go before she has a breakdown. Have a good one. -All right. Bye-bye. -Bye. Good luck. Stacey... what did I tell you about texting at the table? Do you see me typing? I see you looking at your phone. Okay, you want to play "happy family"? How are things with Mom going? You're excused. Thanks. You okay? No, my mom's been, like, coughing in my face. That sucks. All right, you should have it. Okay, lady in an elevator. Watch. This is some chinese shit. My God. What's doing? Just coughed blood on her. Like, I feel like that's super rude. Is that real? Hold on. What are you doing? Emma, did you really just leave me because I said I feel gross? Hang on. Emma! -Don't be a jerk friend. -I gotta go. Emma! Crap. Where are you going? I'll be back in a minute. Why are you calling me when I'm three feet away? Your note said to call you. -Okay. -Could we make this quick? I'm on a really limited call plan. Yeah. Sure. Hello? Emma? She hung up on me. What have we got here? Hey... Bill, this is Emma. She lives right here. We just... we live right here. It's nice to finally meet you, Emma. Likewise. Now I can see why Evan's got a little spring in his step. Okay, Bill. I'll be in in a minute. Looks like I'm getting the boot. Hey, now don't go breaking this little baby's heart, okay? He is... Look at him, he is sensitive. -He is a... -An asshole. Yeah. Kind of, yeah. Good night. Government officials do not believe there is a threat to the United States, in spite of medical exp... Good night, Dad. Night, sweetie. Can I ask you something? Yeah. Is everything okay with you and Mom? Things just seem pretty weird lately. I'm sorry. I get laid off, I go from teaching PhD candidates to high school kids, and, no offense, it's just... I know it hasn't been easy on you and your sister. Right? New school, new friends, new house. Things will be fine, sweetie, okay? Yeah, I guess. Come here. I love you, kiddo. I love you too. Good night, sweetie. Good night. That does hurt! Okay, what is it on a scale? -What is it on a scale? -It's just a six. -Nasty. -Disgusting. I'm sorry, guys. The botfly larva is a multicellular parasite. It's fairly easily removed, as you saw. And you just cover that breathing hole with a piece of tape. Pokes its head up for some air. Pull it out. Ecuador, 1987. Pulled that little guy out of my elbow. Now, I don't know if any of you are following the news. If you're not, you should be. There's something going around that's making people sick. Most are now speculating that it's parasitic, like this guy. Can anyone tell me what a parasite is? Yes, Evan. It's, an organism that lives in another organism. Or on another organism, like head lice. Remember when you had head lice, Emma? Did just stay that? I'm sorry. -No. -Anyway, look at this. Parasites, all right? These guys cannot survive on their own, okay? They need a host. Now, sometimes they live peacefully inside their hosts, but sometimes... this is what fascinates me, guys... Sometimes they take control, going so far as to manipulate their behavior. Toxoplasma gondii. This is a parasite that gets inside of a rat's brain and makes the rat completely fearless around cats. Why? Because Toxo only reproduces in a cat's intestines. So the cat eats the rat, and the cycle then begins again. Is it like how zombies are always biting people to turn them into more zombies? Know what? It's kind of. I mean, the question being... When does a host stop being an animal and simply become a vehicle Gracie. For the parasite? -Are you okay? -A vehicle, mind you, with about as much control as an airplane over a pilot. This is always for the greater good. -Are you okay? It's always in the name of reproduction, of-of proliferation. Now, this parasite that we're dealing with overseas is most likely single-cell. Gracie! Hey, have you seen a girl? Gracie! Gracie? Gracie? Gracie? Gracie? Gracie... Gracie. My God. Help! Help me! What happened? I don't know. -What's her name? -Gracie. Gracie, hey. Gracie? Gracie? Get help. Go get the nurse. You're okay. Somebody help! Help! Over here, straight. Open your mouth. Look up. Up. Great. And, Emma, do you know if Gracie has been exposed to any livestock? I don't think so. Do you know if she's come into contact with anyone who's traveled internationally? Her mom got back from San Francisco this weekend. Okay, and did Gracie mention anything about not feeling well? Last night, she said that her throat hurt. This morning, when I saw her, she looked pretty sick. Did she describe any other symptoms? Yesterday, she said she was really hungry, but I didn't think there was anything weird about that. Okay. Did any of her discharge enter your nose or mouth? No. The health department has just instructed us to cancel classes for today. Now, this is just a precaution... No. No, it was one of the other girls in the class. -Where is she? -Hang on. She's fine. Honey, she's fine, I'm telling you. Mom, I'm fine. See? She's fine. What about you? What's going on? Nothing? There's no cabs? Stacey. That's sick. We need one of those. They're checking all the cars that are leaving town. All right, guys, look, Mom's stuck at the airport. She can't get a taxi. I'm gonna go pick her up. I want the two of you to go straight home, you got it? How are we supposed to get there? -Hey. -Hey, Gracie... Gotcha, you're talking to a machine. Leave a message. Bye. Hey, Gracie, it-it's me, it's Emma. Look, I'm really worried about you, okay? So please just give me a call back when you get this. Bye. Hi, Dad. Girls, I can't get back into town. What? They've closed all the roads. Well, where's Mom? Is she with you? No, she's not, she's still at the airport because they're not letting people in the area, okay? What's going on? Where are you? I'm at the store on route 26. A bunch of us are waiting here. Girls, listen to me, this is important. The whole county's under quarantine. What does that mean? Means we're fucked. Stacey. It means that this thing is serious enough they don't want anybody going in or out of town. Now, I'm gonna head back to the airport and try and get your mom, okay? We'll be back as soon as we can. -Okay. -Listen, promise me two things, okay? Yeah. What? No fighting and no boys over. Yeah. Say it, promise. Yes, promise. Bye, Dad. Okay, bye. I love you. I can't order pizza. The Web site's on crack. Boy. We could have Great Grains cereal mixed with meat-flavored pasta sauce. See, this is what happens when Mom leaves us. Mayonnaise could be useful. Brownies? For dinner? Despite, obviously, the extraordinary pain and hardship, of the families and-and persons who've been affected, and despite the fact that we have to take this very seriously, it is important to remind ourselves this is not an airborne disease. This is one that can be controlled and contained very effectively, if we use the right protocols. What are you doing? I was watching that. It was boring and depressing. Stacey, did you hear that? Sta...? Hello? Hello? -Stacey! -What? -Someone's standing at the front door. -Who? I don't know! Come on. I'm telling you, I saw someone out there. Don't just open the door... Stacey! See? Nobody there. My God! I think you both just shit your pants. How did you even sneak in here with crutches? 'Cause I'm a ninja with the hide-a-key. You know, there is a curfew. I don't even know what a curfew is. -Stacey, Dad said that... -Says a lot of things. Hi. Okay. That her...? You want to get some of this, you got to beat me upstairs. That's so sad that you can't walk like a human. This whole worm flu thing is worse than the president and CDC are willing to admit. Since when does the flu make you want to attack people? That doesn't sound like the flu to me. And plus, you can't just quarantine half the state of California and not declare martial law. That's unconstitutional. Hey, Obama, you can quarantine my... What is all this? Hey, Bill, what's going on? Stacey! Boring. Band-Aid. Boring. What's this? That's a flare. Be careful. Okay. My God. If you come in contact with someone "who exhibits symptoms, please notify the CDC "or your local authorities via the Web site listed below, or contact the CDC hotline." Are we supposed to wear these? I think so. Why are you doing The Robot? Did you just kill yourself? I am so Asian right now. That's not racist at all. You're so serious. Lighten up. It is serious, Stacey. Look at this stuff. -Look at this? -It's a flashlight. Yeah, but it winds up. Hey, Mom. Is that your mom? No, no, no, we're okay. -Tell her I say hi. -Yeah, it's just us. -Where is she? -Where are you? She's still at the airport. We're fine. -O-M-G. -What? Beef taco filling in a box in a bag. What's your IQ? ...are saying, "Don't worry, trust the CDC." But, I mean, patients are going missing. This is crazy! I... Infected people, under hospital care, were are just gone... This is delicious. Good. Try not to eat it all, okay? It's all we've got. This is very, very alarming... Is that my phone? You left it upstairs. Why do you look so nice? There's a party -in Phase Two tonight. -You do look nice. -Thank you. -We can't leave the house. We're alone, Emma, we can do whatever we want. It's not cool, Stacey. There's still a curfew. What's not cool is doing your homework in dirty sweats when there's no school tomorrow. This is true. -Cheers. -Cheers. Well, have fun. Thanks. You, too. I will. What? My God, what a bitch. Balls. I'll see you around. Hey! Hi. Are you wearing makeup? Yeah, like, a little bit, it's... It was Stacey's, I... Do I look like a hooker? Yeah, but, like, a really high-class hooker. Okay. Want to dance? Cool. You're a bad dancer! Wha-what's in it? Tequila. And what else? More tequila. -Hey. -Okay. Where's CJ? I don't know. Asshole. See ya! I'm glad one of us came prepared. Shall we? After you. -I'm sorry, sorry! -My God! What a slut. ...different room? -Anyone in here? -Put your penis away. -Okay. -Okay. Too bright. Not pretty. Better? Yeah. Cool. Okeydokey. What are we doing? We're having a moment. Why are you whispering? I don't know. Why are you? I like you. What the hell is that? -Stacey, wait! -That ho bag! -I thought that was you... -Stay the hell away from me or I take that sweatshirt and shove it so far up your ass. -Stacey, Stacey. -You don't even... What the hell was that? -Hey, hey! -What was what? -What happened to your bra? -They're not worth it. -They're not worth it. -Delicious... -Get off of me! -All right. -Piece of shit. -Baby... B-Baby! Stacey, wait, Stacey. -I need a drink. -Stacey, this is so lame. I really don't think you should care. Emma? Emma? My God! Hey! Yo, I'm talking to you! Dude, hello. Let her go! I'm talking to you! Answer me! I know's a piece of shit, but for two seconds, I thought she was actually my... 's infected! Stacey! Not in here. Come on. -Get out of here! Come on! -What's going on? Stacey, what's wrong with him? Okay. My God. Shit. Is gone? Stacey! Stacey? Did it get in your eyes? Are you okay? Okay. Come on. Hey, Stace, you okay? Yeah. I'll be out in a minute. Why isn't anyone talking about the fact that all these infected attacks started happening at the exact same time, all over the world? It's like the infected are communicating on some secret network that only they can hear. Now there are reports of these gatherings of infected, and these nests across the country. What I'd like to know is what the hell are they up to and why isn't the government doing anything... You had any contact with an infected person? No. Banished are the sounds of children playing, as the uninfected cower in their homes. Civilian military stretched too thin. A crude symbol, increasingly prevalent, indicates which homes have been cleared and those which still need to be inspected. Streets so quiet... I keep getting his voicemail. Mom's, too. ...the uninfected cowering at home. An innocuous letter... an uppercase "I"... holds the key -to the fate -Hey, are you okay? Of the families within. The number on the left indicates the number of infected. The number on the right indicates the members of the household who have been removed. It's him. Hey, Dad. Girls, listen to me very carefully. Lock every window and every door in that house. Nobody in, nobody out. Do you understand? Stacey? I'm here. Do you remember where my gun is? -Yeah. -I want you to find it and keep it on you at all times. Do you understand? Do you un... Dad? There's no reception. Try him again. Dad, are you there? 24 hours ago, military personnel -Well, try again. -evacuated the uninfected, -Dad, hello? -and just moments ago, -Are you there? -Iaunched an air raid, -Dad? -obliterating... -What's going on? -I don't know. The land line's out, too. Power still works. There's no Wi-Fi. This is not a test. This emergency alert has been issued by the Center for Disease Control, in conjunction with the Department of Public Health. The president of the United States has declared martial law. All law enforcement and emergency personnel will be federalized, effective immediately... I know it's somewhere in here. Can you please help me look? What? It's a ring. It's Mom's wedding ring... that she never takes off. She probably showered and forgot to put it back on. Will you please tell me what's going on? -Nothing is going on. -Stacey, Mom and Dad... There's nothing to talk about, so let's drop it. Fine. Where did you learn how to do that? Dad used to take me to the range. Come on, come on. Hey! Over here! Sir, stay where you are. What was that? I don't know. Stay back. Stay right there. -Get back. -It's Mrs. Toomey. Get down on the ground. Get down on the ground now! Get down! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Turn around! Turn around! -That's not a question! -Don't move! That's not a question! We have to get out of here. Evan! This is a restricted quarantine zone. Turn your vehicle around immediately. Stacey, we gotta turn around. -Stay here. -Turn around. -Stacey, what are you doing? -Ma'am... -Get back in the car! Stacey! -Get back in your vehicle, now. -Sir, we're just trying to see our dad. -Stop, now! -Go right there... -Ma'am, get back in your vehicle! -Please, sir. We're not infected. -What part of "get back in your vehicle" -Please. -do you not understand? -Sir, it's just right there. -Get back in your vehicle now! -Ma'am! Ma'am, right now! -Please, we're just -trying to get right there. -Right now! -Stacey! -Get back in your vehicle now... Shit. My God. Shit. ...you are required to stay in your home. By executive order, it is now a felony to harbor an infected individual. Please report any suspected infection immediately. You are required to stay in your home. By executive order, it is now a felony to harbor an infected individual. Please report any suspected infection immediately. You are required to stay in your homes. By executive order, it is now a felony to harbor... I need to tell you something. Okay. What? Dad cheated on Mom. What? Last semester, when I went to visit him at work, I walked in on him with one of his grad students. And I freaked out. So I told Mom and Mom freaked out. Well, why didn't anyone tell me? They didn't think that you could handle it. And they begged me not to say anything. That's why we moved out here; to start over. Looks like that didn't go so well. You should've told me sooner. I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do. And that's why I've been such a bitch, I've just been so pissed. And you could've handled it. I can handle it, Stacey. Stacey? Emma! Open the door! Emma! -Open the door! -Emma, don't... -It's Evan, Stacey! -You don't know if's infected or not! Emma, don't... What's wrong? -He's infected. -Who? I'm gonna get the masks. Is gone? Emma... don't. Get the lights. It doesn't matter; can't see anything anymore. Don't move. Put your masks on. 's right out there. Are you...? You're okay. You're okay. It didn't get on you, it didn't get on you. You're okay. Stacey, my God. Stacey... Stacey? Stacey... Stacey! Emma! Emma! This isn't gonna work. What? No, I won't feed her. You said it only grew when ate. Maybe you can slow it down, but you can't stop this thing. It takes over your body, and it turns you into something else. Emma! Emma! Look... you can go, if you want to. -It's okay. -Emma! I'm not gonna leave her. How are we gonna make sure they don't check the house again? What if they thought we were already gone? Coordinates. This is UF-6 entering sector five. North 47-52-0-6 east... Looks like there's no one here. Emma! Emma! Emma, please! I'm hungry, please! Yeah, Stace, it's me. I'm so hungry. So hungry. I know you are. I can feel it inside of me, behind my eyes, telling me to do things. You've got to fight it, Stace. You have to leave. Emma, please leave. Leave. No. You remember, when we were little, and I came home from school crying because Katie Moore cut off one of my pigtails? Remember? Yeah. And the next day... you made her eat her boogers in front of everyone. It seemed like an appropriate punishment at the time. That-that's what we do. We protect each other. 'Cause... 'cause Dad's gonna come home soon. Okay? Okay. Hey. Anything? How are you holding up? Haven't seen anybody around in a while. I'm never gonna see my dad again. My mom. You don't know that. Yes, I do. I have a feeling. You know... I lost my mom a couple years ago. She had cancer. I watched her turn into something that I didn't even recognize, you know? It was like I was the parent and she was the kid. And Bill... checked out, so... it was just me there. Every day and every night. And, sometimes... I wish I could see her... Remember her... More for what she was instead of what she became. You know? I'm so sorry. I can't leave her. I know. She's the only thing that I have left now. I can't leave her. Please don't make me. -Please. -I won't. Hello? Yo! Stacey? Stacey! The Army split. A bunch of us are getting out of town. Stacey! Help. Stacey? The... What... what happened? They're infected. They locked me in here. -Why? -I don't know. Please help me. Please, I need you. Please help me. I'm gonna get you out of here. -I'm so scared. -I'll get you out of here. Please, please. Please. You really hurt me, CJ. Baby, I know. I'm sorry. That's why I came. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It made me do it. I can't stop it from changing me. Please. Please. Please. Your sister's keeping me busy. Emma, this is nuts. It's a multicellular parasite, Evan. That means it can be removed. Em, trust me, somebody already tried this. It won't work. You're gonna kill her. She's already dead. I'm gonna save her. Thank you. Take my hand. No, it's gonna make me hurt you. You wouldn't hurt me, Stacey. Take it. Em, promise me something. Anything. If I don't make it, you find Dad. And tell him I'm sorry. And I love him. Listen to me. You are gonna see him. And you can tell him yourself. 29, sir. Sector 76. I have a setting for reference one-zero. She's asleep. How much did you give her? It can't breathe. God! No... Stacey? Stacey, it's okay. Listen to me, it's gone. Stacey? It's gone. Hey, it's okay. It's gone, it's gone. By order of the Governor of California, Shadow Canyon is under a mandatory evacuation order. Any remaining residents must evacuate their homes and report to military personnel -in the next 24 hours... -They want us to report. We can't. They'll take her. ...of the Governor of California, Shadow Canyon is under a mandatory evacuation order. Hey, bitch. Come on. All right. Got some really gross soup for you. What is this? MRE shit? It's all we've got. Sorry. -Looks like piss. -Yeah, well... I'm sure it tastes like it, too. God, it looks so much better. Are you sure it's okay to eat? Yeah. It's gone. You guys do it yet? -What? -You and Evan? We've been a little preoccupied. No, haven't really had time to get naked. Thank you. You're welcome. I couldn't have done what you did. You're my big sister. Two residences in Sector 14 showing nest activity. Request permission to go hot. Emma, come here! What? Everything is gone. Stacey! Stacey, wait! -Emma! -Stacey!
