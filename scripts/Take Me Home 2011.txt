Or are you only blowing smoke? Off our tongues we roll lies Hey, didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you so? Everything is under control Come on, I told you About everything under control Like a wild moan Like a wild moan Come on, I told you - Ah! - About everything Under control Like a wild moan Actually, sir, if you could just take a look now, I'd really appreciate it. There's this issue with my landlord. He's kind of on my back. So if you could just, please, please... Thank you. Not bad. Nice work. Good job. Thanks for coming in. - That's it? - You got no studio work. All we do is studio work. Food, fashion, celebrity portraits... - I got celebs. - Who? Uh, I actually just shot Frank Stallone for this... - He's the brother of... - I know who he is. It's out of order. Look, we sell sex. You got no sex in there. See that? We shot that. I'd have sex with that. You are a photo journalist. You take pretty pictures of trees and buildings and homeless people. - Stick with that. - If you could just, um... I, I don't have studio work because I can't afford it. I can't afford it because I don't have jobs that, um, pay like studio work. See? So, I, I really feel like I could be great at this. I just... I... I need someone to take a chance. Good luck with that. - Oh, I love it. - It's kind of that Sinatraesque jazz music. And it's not a scene. It's not like... We could do our work there. We could talk about business. - We could... - Oh, definitely. Oh, hey, hon. Uh, this is my... Uh, Candy. Right. This is Candy. You're not at work. I'm not at work. I am right here. Candy, could you excuse us? Yeah. Sure. Oh, you mean... Mm-hmm. Okay. Now, before you get all in a huff, just hear me out, okay? Candy is the new manager's assistant. While Don's in Anaheim, I'm getting her acclimated. - To our home? - Yeah. We were in the neighborhood, okay? - And I left my laptop. - Oh, Eric. - What? Claire! - Don't power-lunch me, Eric. - Then what do you want to hear? - The truth. - The truth? - That you'd rather spend time, filing things in Candy's drawers than home with your wife. You work just as much as I do, okay? So... It's like a side project, isn't it, Eric? - Oh, no. Not now. Not the big-picture speech. - Working on us. It's like the bedroom walls we never get around to repainting. I mean, what are we doing here? Can I say something? I actually really like the paint in the bedroom. Evicted. I can't believe this. I truly find this unbelievable. Did you ask me if I had the rent? No. Instead you chuck all my stuff out into the hallway. - Do you have the rent? - That's not the point, Dave. Okay, you know what? I'm working tonight, - and I will bring the check in the morning. - You don't work, Thomas. You are a fake cabdriver who drive people around in a fake taxicab! That's on the side. Okay. You know what? I wasn't gonna tell you this. - I got a job today. - A real job? Yes, a real job. And it's a big, fat paycheck. So why don't you help me pick all this crap up and put it right back into that room? Please. Dave. Sorry, Thom. I can't carry you anymore! - Dave. Dave. - No! No! - You gotta listen. Please. - No, I can't do that. Don't do this to me. Dave? Dave! Okay, bye. Suzanne? Um, did you send out the mailing list? - That's it there. - Great. Great. - Suzanne, thanks for staying. - Oh, my pleasure. So, you're done. You heading home? Heading out? You need me to mail those? No. No. - You've done more than enough. - Okay, then. Hey! How's your boyfriend? - What's his name again? - Chris? - Chris. - Oh. Oh, we broke up. - Oh, you did? I'm sorry. - Oh, it's okay. We never really fit anyway. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. I mean, we tried to make it work, but... Oh, he always wanted me to be somebody I'm not. - You know? - Totally. Correcting my grammar, buying me clothes I didn't like, putting a pillowcase over my head and bending me over the furniture. I just... I never got used to it. Hmm. But live and learn. Good guy. Just not the one for me. Yeah. You sure you don't want me to mail those? No. No, I'll get it. Thank you. Okay. Claire, where the hell are yo? Well, I hope you get this. I called your home, but for some reason your machine didn't pick up, so I am calling you here. This is your mama, by the way. I, I shouldn't be leaving a message like this, but it is about your dad. His daughter, Eve, called and he... he went and he had a heart attack. He's okay though. Well, I guess he's not okay. He had a goddamn heart attack. But, he ain't dead. So, I was thinking, I got the number of the hospital he's at in California on the off chance that you might want to call him. Conscience is gonna clean Like bleached white teeth What are your plans for Memorial Day weekend? What's going on out there? Jeff, let's take those calls. Let's hear what people have planned for Memorial Day weekend. Said the choice was easy Came on like a thief Gone like a thrill Sang the key After you leave After you leave Said you're gonna be Guilt free After you leave - Where to? - Drive. - What? - Just drive. I know I have big plans, and, uh, I'm braving it. Oh, God. Are you... I'm a body traced in chalk There's less to see the more I talk You're gonna search your memories And wonder if you ever met me If you're going past Newark, I gotta charge round trip. I don't make the rules. That's... That's headquarters. You can't go past New Brunswick either. That's... That's corporation limit. Heck, even New Brunswick's pushing it. Would you shut up? I'm not paying you to talk. I'm paying you to drive. That's why I took a cab, so that I could sit in the back... while some foreigner who speaks broken English could take me where I need to go. - I don't know where you need to go. - I don't care where. I don't care where. I don't care how much it costs. I will just pay you... whatever it costs. Because I don't care. Do you get it? I don't care! I don't care! Do you care? Oh... - Holy shit. - Mornin'. Holy shit! - Where are we? - Rodney. What? Rodney. It's about an hour outside of Pittsburgh. - Pennsylvania? - That would be the one. - We're in Pennsylvania? - Mm-hmm. - Are you joking? - Mmm, no. - Why would you bring me here? - You told me to. - To drive to Rodney? - "Just drive. " That's what you said. "Just drive. " Oh. Oh, I get it. You drive me all the out here, so you can drive me all the way back. That way you make twice as much. That's really clever. Dan Reeves. - Turn around. - I can't. You'll get your round trip. Now turn us around. I can't drive through the median. It's illegal. I'll pay for the ticket. Just turn us around. - Six miles to the next exit. You'll just have to wait. - Stop the car! Okay. Meter's running. Can you wait in the car? Here's your purse. I got it. I got it. I'm sorry. We can work something out if you, um... You know, if you don't have enough. Anyway... I am sorry. You're a licensed cabbie? Don't point that at me. You have a good record, right? You're professional? - Yeah. - No accidents or tickets? - None. - Honestly? Honestly. I need an atlas. - Ready? - Looks like we just stay on 70. - 70... West? - Mm-hmm. So where we heading? Encinitas. Where is that? Pennsylvania? Ohio? California. Oh, God. You're serious. Yeah. Um, we're not doing that. - Why not? - Oh, I don't know. I got... I got... other things to do. I got meetings. I got deadlines. I'm not just a taxi driver, you know. I'll pay whatever the meter says. The meter would explode trying to calculate a fare that big. Then name your price. We're talking a lot of money. Like, buttloads. - 2,000. - 2,000 gets you to the Pittsburgh Airport. You can fly anywhere in the continental United States. I don't fly. 3,000. 3,000 is carry the one, still not enough. - Four. - Five. - Done. - Six. - You said five. - Five, tonight. A thousand at the end of each day. Five days, 5,000. - Plus accommodations. - Done. - And food. - Fine. Fine. So, uh, Encinitas, huh? Dan, is it? Claire. I'm dying up here. It's this car. It's depressing. - You should take better care of it. - Yeah? That's funny you mention that. I was just about to get, uh, cashmere upholstery in here. Beautiful. But then I splurged on gasoline. Well, I bet you spend a lot of time in here. You'd be surprised what a little T.L.C. could do to brighten your mood. Yeah, I don't think the cab's the problem here. Uh, it wouldn't kill us to get out every once in a while. You know, stretch our legs, get a sense of where we are, how far we've come. That's what, uh, road trips are for. Otherwise, Pennsylvania, Kansas, Utah, you know, they're just names on a map. Might as well be on a plane looking down. There. Let's stop there. There you go. Wait, where? Okay. Can you pop the trunk? Oh. - Right. Let me... - What's all this? Uh, some guy I drove last night left it. - Can we get rid of it? - No! No. He, uh... He asked me to hold onto it. - He called about it, so... - He must be really lonely. You ever notice how really lonely men have huge DVD collections? Fills the void, I guess. Ready? Oh. How can I lose? How can I lose? How can I lose with the help I've got? How can I lose? How can I lose? How can I lose with the help I've got? How can I lose? Tell me, how can I lose? How can I lose with the help I've got? How can I lose? How can I lose? How can I lose with the help I've got? Was it an accident? - What? - What happened back in New York. It's cool with me. It's cool with me. I'm just telling you, I don't want to get dragged into something, you know, as... As what? An accomplice. Come on. You're driving cross-country in a taxicab. Your method of payment happens to be your husband's checkbook. And you don't want your photo taken. That's curious. - I killed my husband. - Shh. Look, I don't really feel comfortable telling you my life story. He found out about the affair. - What? - Your husband. He found out about the... the bohunk living in Encinitas we're heading out to see. Oh, I should've known. I see it now. Look, I'm sure this is a lot of fun for you, but I don't feel comfortable telling you my life story. Then don't. Less I know, the better. Are you gonna do this the whole trip? You're not gonna talk, I'm gonna fill in the gaps. My father's in a hospital in Encinitas. He had a heart attack. So if you're not gonna stop talking, could you at least switch subjects? Absolutely. So... you're married? - What's that like? - It's great. Yeah? I don't think I could do it. I think it's unnatural. Did you know that out of all the mammals on earth, only a quarter of them are monogamous? The rest? Sleeping around. Doin' it. Many of which eat their own poop. I just think we have unrealistic expectations. Did you know that marriage was originally conceived as an agreement between families for financial gain, security... And then somewhere along the line, this whole concept of... of love got stirred in. But they just don't mix. Marriage ruins love. Love ruins marriage. It's awful. Take George and Wilma over there. I bet they were insanely happy, once upon a time. And then they got married. Had kids, went broke. George was a wonderful plumber, but a terrible accountant. Wilma probably blamed him, thought about leaving him, but decided to stick it out, you know? For the kids. And now here they are after all these years... without a thing to say. Maybe they're enjoying it. Sitting with someone they really know. Someone who really knows them. Not having to say something witty or insightful. I like my version better. Just a little bit. It's a better story. For someone who's never been married before, how'd you get to be such an expert? - You must've come close once or twice. - Uh, no. Um, I, uh, got a degree in psychoanalysis. You're a therapist. And a taxi driver. - Wow. - Driving is just something I do on the side. You know, for fun. Well, you might want to change your focus. You're a much better taxi driver than you are a therapist. Oh, baby You gonna make me drive Oh, baby You gonna make me drive Hey, Dan. Dan? Dan? Dan! Dan! - Dan! - Ah! Dan! Aaah! Oh, God! Well, that was... - The alignment seems to be a little... - Stop the car. - What? - Stop the car. - Why? - You just drove across four lanes. - That's because the... - The what? - The alignment? - That's not what I said. - That is what you said. - No. - Pull over. Pull over right now. - What? What are you gonna do, get out and walk? There. There. Pine Bluff Motel in five miles. Take me there. Yes, Ms. Daisy. Getting a hotel room, I'm writing you a check, and then you are going the hell away! Sounds good. Hmm. Do you work here? Sometimes. Good. I need one room, please. Fifty-five, even. Where's my purse? Dan, where's my purse? This purse? Oh. I guess it's not on me. Okay. Well, I appreciate you looking. Yes. I understand. Okay. Thank you. Bye. It says you have 25 cents left. Here. They checked the entire restaurant, the parking lot... Nothing. I had to cancel all the credit cards. The good news is they're gonna send it to my mom's. So we can just pick it up in Vegas. You can blow it all on blackjack or something. - If they find it. Or something. - Mmm. Mm-hmm. Um... what did you say you had on you? - I didn't. - Okay. - Could you check? - Oh, $83. Okay. Credit cards? I have $83 to my name. I thought you were a therapist. I was just... playing around. So you're... you're poor? No, you're poor. I have $83. Fine. Whatever. Isn't there something you want to ask me? No. - Well, can we? - Can we what? Don't be obtuse. You know. Can we use my $83 to get us across the rest of the country? - Well, can we? - Can we what? Can we use your $83 to get us across the rest of the country? No. Why not? You think $83 is gonna get us across half a continent? I don't know. We could fill this whole cab with what you don't know. Now get your hubby to wire you some money. No. Why not? I can't call him. - He's dead, isn't he? - No. - You killed him? - No. Okay, then get him on "thee" phone... so that he can wire "ye" some money, and then we can go the "helleth" away from here. - I'm not calling him. - Why not? - Because! - Because why? Because! You know what? Forget it. Just... Just get out, would ya? Leave your crap, I'll sell it on eBay, and you just go on your merry way. Holy shit, you cry a lot. - Shut up! - Aaah! Ow! No! No! Ow! Hey! No. No. Hey. I don't play that. No, I'm sorry. No, we are not doing this. I do not fight women. Ah! Oh, my nads! All right, that is it. That is it! - Ow! - Huh? Hey! Hey! Yeah? - Where you goin'? - Bathroom. There she is. - Where'd you go? - Oh, I was just... lookin' for food. You hungry? I thought you left. Find anything good? Where you going? - Morning. - Hey, there. - Howdy. - What can I do ya for? Oh, about 10 bucks. I'm cheap and lonely. No. Uh, the guy here last night said there was some sort of, um, breakfast or... Yes, a continental breakfast right around the corner in Conference Room 1. Thank you kindly. I used to have these all the time growing up. Can't believe I never got tired of 'em. Well, good. 'Cause that's breakfast, lunch and dinner. Dan? I know this puts you in an awkward position with the cab company and everything. But it means a lot. So how do we get you to California? Where's the nearest airport? - Where to? - Uh, Elmont, but... We'll get you there. - Elmont? - Probably a suburb. - Probably. - Yeah, I'll find it. You just, uh... Just what? Fill in the gaps. Oh, right. So, uh, next thing you know, my Dad's got $80,000 worth of debt, and four tons of tapioca pudding in the basement. Well, I'll be. What company did you say he was with? Uh, it was the Good Topeka Business... Or Better Topeka... Something... Something. - Never heard of it. - Yeah, it's not around anymore. - Boy, I can see why. - Next right. - Right. - Right. What? No... I... - Good. That was really good. - Was that my street? Uh, no. No, that's uh, construction. No. We're actually gonna take a scenic route. - Left. - Right. And here we are. That'll be 48.50. - How much? - Forty-eight. Forty-eight? I'd say that's a bit steep. - How much is it normally? - About 25. - Sounds good. - I'll get your bags. It was 55, right? 55 College? It was 55 College. What street are you on? Uh, this is... Yeah, this is... Oh, wait, no. This is... How am I looking back there? Um, guess I'll just... Clark, you sit down. Aaah! I think I'm done. Yep. How much do we have left after this? - Uh, hopefully enough to get us through Colorado. - That's it? Haven't driven a car lately, have you? Yeah. Welcome to the rest of the world. - Maybe we should go back to the airport. - God, no. Let's keep going. We can always do this again. Good idea. We'll have better luck in Denver anyhow. I was lost In the lakes And the shapes That your body makes That your body makes That your body makes And the mountains said I could find you here They whispered the snow and the leaves in my ear I traced my finger along your trails Your body was the map I was lost in it Floating over your rocky spine The glaciers made you and now you're mine Floating over your rocky spine The glaciers made you and now you're mine I was moving across your frozen veneer - Yes? - Hi. Hello. This is going to be a strange question, but... Did a young man happen to come here looking to use your restroom or something? No. - Did you lose someone? - Yeah. Yeah, I think I fell asleep in my car. And when I woke up, he was gone. And I don't know why he would stop here. Or, uh... I actually don't know where I am. I'm sorry. - Well, you're in Boulder. - Arnold, who is it? Lynnette, did you see, uh, some guy walking around outside? Well, gosh, no. - What's his name? - Dan Reeves. Well, like the football coach? Uh, sure. This guy she was traveling with... took off while she was sleeping in the car. Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness. Well, we will keep an eye out for him. What's he look like, sweetie? Oh, I have a picture. Surprise! Thom! - That was classic! - Oh, my gosh! I can't believe it. You should've seen the looks on your faces. Well, you had me going. Dan Reeves. Oh, I wish you'd let me know you were coming. The place is a mess. Your father promised me he was gonna sweep up. - We wanted to surprise you. - Well, it's just an absolute mess. Uh, Mom, Dad, this is Claire. Hello. Hi. So what brings you out here? Well, you know, uh, we, uh, got this crazy idea to travel cross-country, and I thought, hey, I know someone in Boulder. - So... - So you drove from New York, just like that? - Just like that. - What fun! - Yeah! - That's fun! Well, I don't believe it. - Well, are you guys hungry? - Not really. - Starving. - Oh, wonderful. Let's get you fed. Come on, sweetheart. - We just had dinner. - We can't spend too much time. We have to get, uh, back on the road soon, Mom. Okay. What would you like to eat, sweetheart? Why don't you sit right here, next to the father. And that is Asian chicken on the table. It is so very good. And then I have some meat loaf and some bean salad. Uh, Lynn, I'll take some more meat loaf. Oh, that's a good one, isn't it? Those are our surgeons. Uh, that's Todd and Marsha. And that's Gracie, our little Olympian. And then I think you know the cute guy in the middle. - I wish you had told me you were coming. - Mom. I would've fixed something a little fancier. - Mom, this is great. - I'll have the chicken, please. Oh, Asian chicken. - Dishes. - So, exactly, uh, how did this come about? Uh, you know, it was a spur of the moment kind of thing. Uh, we both had time off from work, so we figured, why not? Thom? - Uh, anything. Just... - So, uh, where you two heading? Lynnette, I'll take some more meat loaf. Thanks. Well, my mom lives in Vegas, so we're gonna go there. And then I also have some family in San Diego. - Oh, a California girl. - Lynnette. Well... Not exactly. My half sister and my father live there. Oh, how often do you get to see them? Oh, about, uh, every 20 years or so. I grew up with my mom. - Oh. - In Vegas? In Vegas, Atlantic City, Orlando, pretty much everywhere. - So how did you two meet? - Uh, Mom. Oh! Oh, well, excuse me. If somebody would just call his parents every once in a while... and fill them in on what's happening in his life, I would not have to be so nosy. - But, so, do you work together? - No. - No. - No, I'm in nonprofit. I don't think I'd last very long as a cabbie. A cabbie? Yeah, like your son. Thom? I didn't tell you guys about that? That you drive a cab? Yep. Well, on the side, you know, for fun. Well, what happened to Wall Street? Nothing happened to Wall Street, Mom. It's still there. It's just, uh, you know, I, uh, got a mobile office, Wi-Fi, satellite kinda thing. I just, you know, don't have to be rooted to a desk anymore. I can literally work anywhere. So I can just type it in, and off it goes. - I'll have the chicken if there's... - But why, a cabdriver? Well, I mean, why not, you know? When in New York... Right? Uh, plus, it's always been a dream of mine to overhaul the-the transit system there. So I figure, you know, might as well start with one out of a fleet. And, uh, so I figure... So you own a cab? - It's out front. - Here? You just... You just drove out here in a taxicab? - Sure did. - What fun! - Yep. - Goodness! You came all the way out from New York in a... - It's unbelievable, isn't it? - Wow. - Wow, wow, wow. - Yep. Is it one of the Checkers, or is it a little yellow one? - I always liked the yellow ones. - It's a... It's yellow. - Oh, good. They smell better. - Well, uh, if you could excuse me for a moment. Oh, sure. Oh, if you need the bathroom, sweetheart, it's just past the, uh, pantry on the right. Oh, you wanted to have meat loaf? Uh, chicken. Asian chicken. Good for you. - Well, would you look at that. - Yeah. - What fun! - Yeah. So, how much is he charging you, Claire? No, I'm kidding. I am so kidding. Well, it was really nice to meet you. I just wish we had more time together. Are you sure you don't want to stay until breakfast? Because your father doesn't even have to leave until 10:00 and we... Yeah, I'm... I'm... I'm sure, Ma. All right. Well, it was nice to meet you anyway. Not a lot of time, but hopefully... How are you doing on cash? Need some money for gas or whatnot? Uh... No. Okay, um... All right. A pleasure. So, you have your dad's new telephone number? Yes. Okay. You'll call when you get to California? - Yeah. I, I will. - Just to let us know if you're all right. - Right. - Okay? - Okay, Mom. - Safe trip. Thanks. You okay? Let me know if you need to switch. You can't drive. Not legally. Claire. Wow. Did you know about this? I have no idea how we got here. That's impressive, what with you, um... driving the car and all. I must have dozed off. No, I dozed off. You apparently went into a coma. We're alive, aren't we? Let's get back in the car and find the highway. The highway you drove off? - Yes. - How do we do that, Claire? Is there an on ramp I'm not seeing here? - We follow the tracks. - What tracks, Claire? Unless you sprinkled bread crumbs for us to follow, there are no tracks. Why are you being an ass? It's not like I meant to do this. You realize that makes it even worse, right? 'Cause that means we have no way of getting back. Fine. You stay here. I'm sure the tumbleweeds can appreciate your sarcasm a whole hell of a lot more than I can. That was going to be so cool, wasn't it, with you driving off? Shall I? So when exactly were you diagnosed as a compulsive liar? I'm not a compulsive liar. Nah, you're Hall of Famer Dan Reeves. Well, yeah, I lied about that. And about being a therapist. And a Wall Street tycoon. And just now about not being a liar. - That's kind of oversimplifying it, isn't it? - Well, it's kind of simple. - You lie habitually. - I don't see what the big deal is. Women are always like, "You know what? Let's just be completely, brutally honest about everything. " And then somewhere along the lines that turns into, "I hate that you squeeze from the wrong end of the toothpaste," or, or, um, "You know when you're making that face when we're making love? Don't do that. That's ugly. " Or, uh, "I wish you looked like a model. " "And I've wanted to have sex with every person I've seen today except you. " You feel better? I know I do. Oh! I'm so glad I got that off my chest. I mean, I would much rather tell a few white lies than put in all that work. And the lies back at your parents' house, that wasn't work? All that backpedaling? And for what? They don't care if you're some Wall Street zillionaire. They just want you to be happy. - And how would you know that? - Because they're unhappy. - They are? - Completely. Your dad keeps everything bottled in. Your mom barely acknowledges your dad. Whatever those two had when they got married they gave up on a long time ago. Yeah, well, you know what? It can't be all rainbows and chocolate hearts, you know? They had kids, responsibilities. Eventually, you have to settle down. Some people settle down and some people just settle. Well, it's clear which category you fit into. - What? - Oh, come off it. You escape New York faster than Kurt Russell. And then you demand that I take you back once you feel like I'm scamming you. And then you-you-you-you ask me to drop you off at a motel in the middle of nowhere. I mean, make up your mind. You're like a Ping-Pong ball. Someone gives you a little tap and you just go flying. I left New York because I caught my husband having an affair. Oh. - Yeah, oh. - You, like, um... caught him? Pretty much. There was definitely something going on. But you didn't see anything? I don't... See, I didn't see... I don't need to see something. I just know. There was no, like, e-mails? You didn't find pictures from the Bahamas or anything? I just know. All right, okay. Why are you laughing? When I drove off the road, you caught me. This? This just sounds like someone looking for a way out. How much further, you think? Depends. On what? Whether we're going toward it or away from it. We could be two days from the nearest road by now. Great attitude. Let's stop crapping ourselves, shall we? The likelihood of us getting out of this alive, gets slimmer the longer we're out here. If the cold doesn't get us tonight, the heat will tomorrow. Would you shut up? You wanna pretend there's a Marriott over the next horizon, you do that. But I would much rather spend our energy trying to figure out how to, you know, keep each other warm. How do you suggest we do that? No, thanks. Well, I'm not talking about... Whatever. You think it's cold now? Wait a few hours. Thom. - Salvador Snchez - It's an easy fix. He arrived, then vanished Only 23 with so much speed Owning the highway Almost done. - Great. - Said we should be on the road in no time. Why are you so camera shy? I'm not photogenic. - I find that very hard to believe. - Mmm. - I could show you some school pictures. - Oh, come on. Oh, yeah. I could show you one from third grade. My mom, she did my hair up in a... in a really hot perm. It was really sexy. - That sounds really sexy. - And then she put all this make-up on my face... and put me in this leather vest that I really, really hated. I looked like a rodeo clown. I got teased on the bus, it was that bad. Anyway, a few years later, I went to go visit my dad and Eve... that's my sister, half sister... and wouldn't you know it, that picture's on his fridge. And he said, "See... I look at you every day. " But it wasn't me. It wasn't even me in third grade. It's just a picture. Can I take your picture? No! - Come on. - Didn't you just hear my whole story? Look, when you get old, like, really old, you're gonna want to share memories, okay? Maybe not of hot-perm, rodeo Claire, but definitely of something like this. Why can't you just take it without me? Because without you in the picture, it's a flat shot. It's like a postcard. But if you... All right. All right, here. Go on take a look. All right, put me on, like, the side of the frame. You see how it's a little easier to take in all of it with something in the foreground? Yeah, it's just not the same. Yeah, exactly. So... can I take your picture? All right, you're looking at 355 all told. I thought it was an easy fix. It was, but with the tow, it's 355. - Uh... - Oh, we can't pay that. We can't pay that. I'm sorry. I actually don't think that you understand, um, I lost my purse four states back, and when I say that we... we can't pay that, I actually mean... You should've thought of that before you decided to park your car in the middle of the desert. Okay. - Uh, we'll call the taxi company. - Yeah, I don't know if the taxi company is... I mean, I'm sure they have roadside assistance, Triple A. Um... Something like that, so... This car isn't registered under any company. So, no, there's no roadside assistance. - Hold on, I think I got... You know what? I got something. - What are you talking about? If this was a commercial vehicle, it'd have different plates. This car isn't registered under any company anywhere. Just, uh, Thom Colvin, that guy. - Okay? So that'll be... - 355. - Thank you very much. - Taxi company. Um... All right, hold on, okay. - I am aware this is bad. - Is there anything else? What? Is there anything else you haven't told me? I bought this at an auction last spring. And when I get really low on cash, I use it to pick people up. It's not something I do all the time. I just... I got kicked out of my apartment the first night you met me, and I didn't tell ya because I needed to make money. And then I didn't tell you because I was embarrassed. And then it was just, you know... it was, too late. Also, the DVDs in the back are all mine. Also, the first night when you fell asleep in the back, I looked up your skirt. A lot. The cash... Uh, the cash wasn't mine, it was my parents', and I didn't borrow it from them. I stole it. And, um, this morning... uh, this morning I... I heard the highway and I didn't wake you because I wanted to... sleep in with you. And though you have, uh... you have absolutely nothing to go on, I want you to know that I am, uh... I am tired of the way I am, and, um, I will never lie to you again. I know. We don't go out in the city We ain't been part of the scene I can't lie I am yours, you are mine No lie, we are free And ain't no lie, the girls out on the strip They ain't got nothin' on you, kid They ain't got nothin' on you They ain't got nothin' on you I know he would be really happy and sleep better... knowing that you are safe and sound. He's your husband, you know? Uh, I do know that. Look, I am not gonna get in the middle of it. I just think he deserves a call. Let him know you're okay. Call him. Maybe. - Well, I tried. - Yes, you did. Yes, you did. Thom, have you met Claire's better half yet? Uh, you know, I, I, uh... I have not yet. Oh, he is quite a catch. He's, like, seven feet of muscle. He gave me the most beautiful sweater for Christmas. It was cashmere. It's just simply gorgeous. And practical, here in Nevada. Well, I think it's beautiful. It's a lot nicer than the golf clubs that Jared got me. Remember that? I mean, what the hell was I gonna do with golf clubs? Except maybe clunk him over the head with one. Mom. Sweetheart? Hmm? - You got my message about your father, right? - Yeah. We're driving there in the morning. - How are you feeling about that? - Fine. We'll talk later. What's there to talk about? I haven't called yet. I decided I would just go and see him. He still at the hospital? You didn't get my message. Monday night. No, I left another one after that. You never loved me Anymore You just don't seem The service is tomorrow. Like before - Just take some love - I'm sorry, Claire. Claire. Claire. - Claire? Claire, honey. - It's okay. I got it. All right... Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, Claire, come on. No, no, don't... don't do this. - Get out! - Now hold on. Just breathe here. Just don't... All right, let's think this... No, no, no, no, no! That's okay. That's okay. I do that all the time. It's okay. Pick up my can. Pick it up. My can. Just a second. Okay. Sorry. I'll move it back. Don't... Towels are in the closet by the bathroom. Thanks. I'm crying already and I didn't even like him. I brought lots of goodies. - Yeah. - I got potato chips, and I got pretzels, and I got a lot of gum. Do I look all right? I was gonna have... do a hot perm, but I didn't have time. No, this is good, what you got going on. Down where the deer ate dying grass And here where the starving robins asked Oh! Look at this beautiful house! Eve. Claire. - You are so tan, Eve. - Oh, hey, Jill. Oh, you're practically Mexican. - Mom. - What? That is a compliment. - This is Thom. - Hi. Eve. - Thom. Nice to meet you. - This is, um, my husband, Alan. This is Jill. - Hi. How do you do? - Hello. Nice to meet you. - This is Thom. - Hi, there. Welcome, hello. - And this is Claire. - Oh, hi, Claire. Lovely to meet you. Oh! Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, Eric, my big bear. - How are you? - I wear your sweater all the time. I would expect nothing less. Hi. I, uh... I got on a plane as soon as I heard. When was that? Last night. Well, um, I gotta see a man about a dog. - Eve, may I use your boudoir? - Yes. Bye, y'all. Uh, Thom. - Hey, Eric. - Heard a lot about you. Um, Claire, can we talk? - You want a beer? - Uh, yeah. - How was the drive? - Well... Long. For the last month, we'd been working a lot together, getting pretty close and, uh... I don't know, I guess I just like to talk to somebody else about us. I don't know. Anyway, around that time that's when, um, we had our big fight. I knew we had to work things out, so I called Candy over to the house to call it off because I just wanted to stop it before... And that's when you came home and found us. Now, Claire, it's not her fault, okay? It's my fault. I let it go too long. I should've stopped it before it got out of hand and... She's a great girl, and I'm sure under different circumstances the two of you would be great... Point is, Claire, is that I never crossed that line. You gotta believe that. Because I believe we can work things out. I'm gonna work on being... On what? Being more married? More in love? Both. Hi. Sorry to interrupt, but I think everyone's here. We're gonna walk down? - Yeah, thanks, Eve. We'll be right out. - All right. You know, when you were gone, I nearly lost it. I'd come home, empty house and you weren't there and... I don't want to feel like that ever again. Well, judging by how many people showed up here today, I think it's... safe to say that Dad was probably the loneliest man on earth. It's understandable. He was a hard man to know. And he didn't believe in second chances. What's done is done. I don't buy that. We can change. We do change. We don't have to take our regrets to the grave like he did. We can be free of all of that. We don't die inhaling. We exhale. We leave it all behind. Oh, uh, thanks. Um... - I like Eric too. He's got all that muscle. - He's not me. I hope a check's okay. It's fine. You going back to New York? You know, I can be poor anywhere. I might as well be on the road for a little while. Um, where's the, uh... Where's the airport from here? I don't know. Thought you said you didn't fly. Well, it's time I got over it. Those pilots know what they're doing. And it's safer than driving. Depends who's driving. Well, I think that's everything, sweetheart. But you forgot your scarf. So, all right? Whoa. Hey, Thom, you, uh... you live out of your car, pal? Why's that? I... Well, why's that? Look at all the decorations in this bad boy. Isn't it great? Yeah, but, it looks like a pottery barn in here. But it's great. It's, It's... It's great. - I'll take a last look. - Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. - I think we're all good. - I wish you didn't have to go. Claire! What did you just say? I said... I wish you could stay. I can't do that. I know. Claire! Hey, Claire? I'm sorry about your father. Thank you. He, uh... He really missed out. Oh, you're the only one that does that to me, baby. Yeah, well. Okay, all right. I want sweaters for Christmas. You'll get two this year. I promise. - Turquoise. - Just no pink. You be careful. I love you. - Bye. Love you too, you guys. - Bye, guys. Bye. Doesn't get any easier, darling. She's been in my life 29 years, and it still hurts to see her go. Okay, we're gonna get back on the 5. We're gonna drive for about 60 miles. And then we are going to see that burger joint and we are going to stop... Come on, come on. Battery Park City. Have a good day, folks. Yeah, did Don see it? Then what'd he say? Then what's the problem? That's exactly what I was telling... Sorry, sweetheart. You know what, look, um... Okay, good. So... So you're basically telling me, Selena, that I spent four and a half hours on a plane reading a stupid thing... that we're not even gonna be actually dealing with? No, you told me that he'd actually read it. Hello. Right. Now you're telling me that he just read it now? Why didn't you tell me this when I was in California? Okay, look, do me a favor. Do not tell me to do something unless he has made a decision himself. - Home, sweet home. - Home, sweet home. I love seeing those little colored balls. If you find my eyelash, would you mail it to me - because that's human hair. - Sure will. And I hear my phone ringing. Everything happens as soon as I'm home. You're telling me... I mean, you're driving me insane. Hold your ponies. Oh. Put him on the phone. Okay. Hello? - Hey. - Hi. Did you make it home in one piece? Oh, come on Yeah, come on Ohh, ohh Oh, come on Yeah, come on Ohh, ohh Ohh Oh, come on Hey, come on Let your love Oh, come on Oh, come on Let love No, no. No, no, that's... Oh, God, no. That's Bill Semrock. No, no, no, no. This is Bill Wells. The exhibition artist. Remember? He was the guy who had that show in Greenpoint... where he hung himself from a flagpole by his nipples. - Remember? - Right. Right, I remember. Well, he and I went to one of those parties where everybody is in cages. Right. And, you know, people are crawling all over each other pretending to be wild animals. What were you? A turkey. Bill was a dolphin. How cute is that? Oh, my God. Oh, we had the best time. Suzanne, I'm really happy for you. - Oh, yeah. It's about time, huh? - Yeah. Oh, before I forget, San Diego called about the celebrity auction. Are you going to be able to go? Yeah, that's fine. I'll just give them a call in the morning. All righty. All right. - See you tomorrow. - Thanks, Suzanne. - Bye. - Bye. Hola, my beautiful sister. It's Eve. Happy belated Easter, for what that's worth, I don't know. I got your message and I think that would be so awesome. Lady, you pick the date, I am there. We'll eat, we'll surf, do everything you're supposed to do here in beautiful Encinitas. Which is, uh, eating and surfing, now that I think about it. Anyway, call me. I love you. Hey, it's, uh... it's Eric. I just called to let you know I dropped off some of your mail. Your landlord said he'd put it inside your apartment for you so I wanna make sure you got it. I hope you're doing okay. Um, that's it. Okay. Bye.
