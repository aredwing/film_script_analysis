Why're you so worried? The flight literally belongs to my old man today! Mind-blowing, dad! The trip was mind-blowing! Not that one, that one is raw. Eat this... this is a ripe one What difference, dad...? They're the same colour lt isn't the colour, son. lt's the aroma You tell a good mango from its smell. Here you are Useless fellow! You've been coming to the farm for the last 25 years And you still can't tell a good mango! With an expert like you around, why must l worry? This is mind-blowing! There's a crate for your friends. Don't forget it And what did your friends have to say? Who else went with you to Jaisalmer? Well, there was Hari, Raj, Happy... Your mother was furious. But l side-stepped the issue You didn't tell her that l chartered a plane for you, did you? No, l didn't. Am l out of my mind to tell Mother lndia about it, dad? You know what Mother lndia would have to say Aditya! You've blown up 1.5 million in just a single day! lshwar, how could you give this useless son of yours a chartered plane? ''lshwar, this boy spends money like water'' ''And we've never been so liberal even with water'' Mother lndia! Sumi... so you've overheard? Yes, she has overheard! Do something, quick! Mom, it wasn't dad's fault. l insisted on a chartered plane Yes, Sumi. He had promised to take his friends to Jaisalmer on a chartered plane And how could he break a promise? - Why...? Haven't you taught him how to break promises? You're so good at breaking promises. - Me...? Yes. You make promises and break them every day ''That's it, Sumi. l'm going to stop spending money on Adi's indulgences'' ''l promise. l also promise not to buy him another bike'' ''And his everyday parties at 5-star hotels are off... l promise'' Ma, l... - Better if you don't talk to me! l was talking about this tree. When it was one year old... lt has grown up. And it also realises its responsibilities The gardener looked after it. So it is repaying a debt by bearing fruit now Do you understand? - Aditya will bear it too... the fruit Sumi, Aditya has changed. l mean, he's in the process of changing Have some patience, Ma. l... - For how long? 20 years more? Or 25 ? - Taking a dig, eh? Here, look at my photographs! They'll appear in top magazines Producers are betting their shirts to sign me. You'll see... Why, Adi? Why would the producers sign you? Well.. because l'm good-looking... l'm rich and... - You're lucky! Yes, l'm lucky. - Wait and see, Sumi This boy will feature in our ad for the toys As you know, as a postman earlier, l used to give people their letters And this boy will get tons of fan-mail! After all l'm a star, Mom! Look at the lines on my palm! They reach out to the very end! - Don't trust the lines so much, Aditya They seem to imply one thing, and give you quite another Pretty serious, isn't she? Mother lndia! Excuse me... What a pretty sari. - Thanks But it's ordinary compared to yours! That trademark flower-band in your hair looks very pretty lt's lshwar's gift, literally. He personally brings one for me everyday ls that all? A measly flowerband? l give my Ashalata a bouquet everyday! Really? Does your wife go around with a bouquet in her hair everyday? The two of them are at it again. Shall we...? Wasn't me, it was Natu who took off He says, ''That's nothing'' at everything anyone says... So Mr Naidu...? What are you gentlemen discussing? My son Venkat! He wants to ignore my hotel business and turn a Pop singer l spent half a million rupees! ''You're pregnant, l'm a beggar at heart...'' To record that cursed song, he had six sessions! That's happening in every family. - But that's very good, Mr Naidu You ought to be happy with your son, his cassettes are selling quickly Two cassettes! Only 2 cassettes! l bought a cassette which got spoilt So l was the one who bought the second cassette, too! He's forgotten all about his education and learning! That's really sad, really sad. But we're very lucky in this respect Our son Adi wants to become a film actor But he's completing his education. He stands first in the college every year That's nothing! Ashalata's niece came first in college every day! Hear that...? Every day! - Every day! For the 8 'o clock classes, she got to the college at 6 ! That's very nice, Natu-bhai! You know something...? My son stands first in studies and also first in drama-competitions every year He's really a very good actor! - That's nothing Ashalata's nephew is the greatest actor He played a mailbox in one of his school plays He gave such a superb performance... people thrust their letters in his mouth even today! Your son is nothing! - What was that...? My daughter is like Einstein in brains and Aishwarya in beauty! One of a kind! Your son's a big zero. He's dumb! - He's had too much to drink, lady... take care of him, else... - l'll take care of him What's wrong with him, Sumi? He gets started at just any place! He took off at Agarwal's funeral the other day ''What...? Just a thousand people?'' ''There were 5000 people at my uncle's funeral'' He must've been joking. - What joking! He took off on the lenses of someone's glasses the other day l said, the peon in my office can't see without his glasses And Natu the great says... the peon in my office goes deaf without his glasses! l asked, ''Why? Does he use his glasses for hearing?'' He says, ''No, he uses a hearing-aid. He needs glasses to find the hearing aid'' What are you laughing for? - But he's got a point He's got a point all the time, Sumi! My grandpa's great! My Uncle's great! And my Ashalata... absolutely original! Sure. As if our wives are all duplicates! Let him be. - There we were, talking about Adi and... Your Adi... he's nothing! He's a zero! He's good for nothing, take it from me. l know that wastrel! Will you listen to me... please step aside You tossed me into the swimming pool...? But this is nothing! My brother-in-law threw me in the sea! Don't laugh, Sumi - ''No offense towards my dad,'' l heard But no offense against my son? l hadn't heard that He said it twice! Aditya is nothing! Whereas my Aditya is... What is he? What is your Aditya? Natu-bhai said nothing wrong, lshu. Aditya's really nothing And he'll become nothing either. You know why? Because you want to pamper your darling son So mustn't l love my son? - Hey! As if l don't love Aditya But that doesn't mean we succumb to each of his whims and fancies 1.5 million rupees in a single day on a chartered flight, lshu...?! Why shouldn't l fulfill all his wishes, Sumi? Why shouldn't l do it? What did we have when we came to this city? We had no roof over our heads, we didn't have enough to eat We were terrified when we thought of fulfilling a desire of ours ln fact, we even thought our dreams were expensive! But today, if this postman who went around delivering people's letters... has become a rich businessman... it's because of his son and offspring, Aditya l've built all this only for Aditya Will you continue doing it all his life? lshu, you know what problems we're going through So what am l expected to do? - Tell Adi the truth, lshwar No Before someone else tells him... - No, Sumi Nobody, except you and me, knows about it. And if... But you have to tell him someday, don't you? He won't be able to bear the shock. - He will have to Maybe it'll make him change, he'll become more responsible? Sumi... l don't like that look! - l have a way! ''We're emperors of our world...'' ''our world's full of fun'' ''We're emperors of our world...'' ''our world's full of fun'' ''We've seen off our woes...'' ''we hardly find time from our happiness'' ''Every prank of yours, l've been part of'' ''From you l learnt to make the most of a fun-filled life'' ''l'm going crazy'' ''Father and son, we always were. But we're friends too'' ''Ever since you have arrived, l have rediscovered...'' ''my younger days in you'' ''We're emperors of our world...'' ''our world's full of fun'' ''From you l got my life...'' ''from you, l got this world'' ''This world would've meant nothing had you not been part of it'' ''Every hardship is behind us'' ''Our destinies are one now'' ''We have no grudge, nor complaints...'' ''we have everything we ever wanted'' ''We're emperors of our world...'' ''our world's full of fun'' ''We've seen off our woes...'' ''we barely find time from our joys'' Good shot, dad Adi, l've decided to get you married to Richa, my friend Pratap's daughter We're meeting at the club at 5 tomorrow.

We never had such fancy ideas in our time You mean all this will be wasted if it's a baby-boy And all that will be wasted if it's a baby-girl? What waste? We aren't misers like you to have just one kid, Ma! We're going to have two children We're going to have two children. What say?

And he'd have had to say, ''l could've become a very successful star...'' ''but l had to give it all up because my father died suddenly'' No, Sumi... l will not let my impending death become an excuse for Adi's failure ln fact, whatever little time l have... l will try to make it the key to his success The poor boy has asked for only two months They'll go by even before we realise it You will stand by me, won't you? Yes. Time will stand by us too Apart from Adi's success, you have also to see your grandson Will l be able to see him, Sumi? - Of course you will, lshu God ought to realise, Sumi l'm a man who has sold toys to children all over the world... and now l'm going away without even playing with my own grandchild l see a bridge between the earth and the heavens, Sumi l see myself at one end of the bridge.

Nothing would've gone wrong had you accepted it Get a hold on yourself, Natu-bhai My disease is just nothing Your grandfather must've had two cancers Enough now lf Adi sees you, all hell will break lose. Please Wipe your tears. - l tell you, let alone me... no father can compare himself with lshwar Chandra For the sake of their children, parents give up their lives But you have even defied death l could achieve nothing in life But before l die... if l could set an example for Adi, it'll be worth it So that his son calls Adi the best father in the world lf something happens to me, give this doll to Adi... Where's the doll? He has found out, Sumi. - What? He has found out. - What are you saying? He must've overheard, Sumi. - Had he heard... he'd have broken down before you. - That's what l fear.

My father wants to see my baby... before his death He's battling against death Will each one of you... please pray to God and dedicate one minute of your lives to my dad? This boy will ruin everything! God cannot turn down the prayers of millions Just a minute will be taken from your lives... but it'll give my father a precious lease of life My father will be able to see his grandson You must be wondering why you must give away a minute of your life... just to make my father live But if you look at your children playing in your courtyards... you'll probably find the answer My daddy... makes toys A baby smiles on seeing the rattler hung up on the cradle My father designs the first smile of the baby The baby claps when the monkey-toy jumps... and he is upset when the monkey falls to the ground The mother then explains... ''Son, this is what life is all about'' ''So if you happen to fall, don't be upset'' ''Rise, and walk again'' My father designs some upbringing ln this barbaric world, my father fills babies with innocence lf he has in some way helped in the upbringing of your children... then in return, please give him a minute of your lives Whether my father will be able to see his grandson's face or not... is in your hands The hands that you have joined before God... Dad! My darling! You think only you can act? l did some acting too somehow. - l love you, dad l love you We've got our son back, Sumi We've got our Adi back, Sumi You don't look good when you are crying Wipe your tears ... here's the handkerchief Wipe your tears Handkerchief in your pocket?
