I'm thinking! Monica, you didn't come home last night. It is last night and I am home. My home, not yours! Why are you looking at me? Just lookin'. Why are you so afraid to sleep with me again? Because you scare me. I don't know what you want from me. - Everything. - That's too much. What do you want from me? I don't know. - Something. - That's not enough. All or nothing with me, baby! God, I love it when you look afraid and surprised at the same time! I just wanna climb inside of you! That feels good! Would it feel so good if some other guy was touching you like this? You're like one of those girls who'll fuck everybody except the guy who loves her. You're like one of those rides at Disneyland. Wow! You make me dizzy! - Show me your tits. - What? What for? - Tar! - What? Tar. It means crazy, disgusting person, jerk. Tar? I'm a tar? Forget it. Show me your toes. A woman's toes are very important. I'd love to know what's behind that face of yours. I stare at you and stare at you and I can't see anything. What do you wanna know? I'm from Earth. I'm a person. I love you. That's not enough. - Jesse... - What? Say something nice. - Like what? - I don't know. I don't know either. All right. How's this? Your shoes were red, my suit was blue. You left me in Vegas, but I'll always love you. That's nice, isn't it? Hello. Strand Auto Parts? Hello. Mr Birnbaum? Is he gonna be there this afternoon? Tell him... Tell him I wanna come see him. Jack Burns. Yeah. I think Mario called. Called him all about me from Vegas. I'm supposed to bring over a little foreign job. Jack Burns. Right. This afternoon. Bye. A little foreign job? Not you, a car. - Monica, come out here. - No! Is this your driver's licence? What? No, no. That's my brother's. Mine's in the car. But the name here is Jack Burns. How can he be your brother? Yeah, right, right. That... Well, he's not my real brother. You see, cos when... When I was born, my mother was already divorced. - I doubt it. - Me, too. You know William Faulkner? Who's he? Somebody you fucked? The most beautiful American writer. He wrote my favourite line. "Between grief and nothing, I will take grief." This guy sounds like a lot of laughs. No! Seriously. Grief or nothing? What would you choose? Nothing. Like I told you, baby. All or nothing with me. If I was William Faulkner, would you let me touch you like this? No. Hello. This is Monica. I'm not here, but if you leave a message and tell me your name and number, I will call you as soon as I come back. And don't forget to wait for the beep sound. Thank you. Hello, Monica. Paul. I'm sorry that Boudreaux ran off last night, but you can meet him this afternoon. I got you a pass to the groundbreaking. So, great. I'll tell you. You make keeping promises very easy. - Fuck you, Charlie! - No, don't turn it off. It's in Venice on Main and Rose. Right. And you'll meet him. And the old and the famous and everybody. This afternoon at three. Three o'clock. And one more thing. I enjoyed last night enormously. Ciao. The suspect has a criminal record of car thefts and petty crimes in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California. This is believed to be Lujack's first murder charge. Police have issued this 1975 photo of Lujack... Oh, my fucking Christ! ... medium-length brown hair, age 28, with a small heart-shaped tattoo on his chest. We'll be keeping you informed on this story as it develops. Caught in a trap I can't get out I'm caught in a trap! - We're caught in a trap... - I can't walk out I'm caught in a trap - I can't walk out - Because I love you too much... Because I love you too much, baby - Why can't you see - Why can't you see - What you're doin' to me - Jesse? When you don't believe a word I say We can't go on together with suspicious minds And we can't build our dreams On suspicious minds - You're crazy! - So what? It's OK. I like it. I can't walk out Because I love you too much, baby Caught in a trap I can't walk out Because I love you too much, baby I'm late. Don't take a shower. I want us to smell like we've been fuckin'. That one. - What's that? - The Silver Surfer. Sky-rider of the spaceways. - Who is he? - Who's he? He's a space-lost freak lookin' for love. Love? Yeah. You see, he's got this problem with his girlfriend. They're trapped on two different galaxies. No kiddin', really. I'll show you. Come here. See, he's gotta go away never to return. "Though infinity beckons, I must leave behind my very heart." "Never has there been, never will there be another such as you." "If leave you must, then let us depart together!" "Say no more! It cannot be! It can never be!" "Where soars the Silver Surfer, there must he soar alone." It's sad. Why does he have to soar alone? It's a long story. He never stops thinking about her. He doesn't forget. Listen to this. "I have seen the birth of planets and the death of worlds." "I have seen galaxies crumble and new suns aborning." "But in every star, in every sun, I see her face!" Hey, what are you doin'? Trying to shut my eyes very tight, so everything goes black. But it never gets completely black. You know, you said I was afraid. It's true. I'm afraid because I'd like you to love me. And then of... I don't know. I wish you wouldn't love me. You don't fit into my plan for my life. Well, you're just going to have to change those plans, darlin'. Anyway, don't worry about it. I don't love you the way you think I do, anyway. How do you love me? Not the way you think. You don't know what I think. Yes, I do. You don't know what I'm thinking about now. Yes, I do. I might be pregnant, Jesse. - Did you see a doctor? - Tomorrow. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! A little muchacho for you and me! Maybe. It's not for sure. ... 1961 MGB Roadster. Colour pink. - How long's the car been here? - We don't know yet. You don't know? Find out! Ask! There's three freeways nearby. He could be long gone. Nah, he ain't gone. He's around here somewhere. I can smell him! - No! - Yes! - No! - Yes! So many cars in your business. Hey, where's my favourite dress? Isn't a woman allowed to change her mind? I feel so free with you. Come on. Let's just go, sugar. Let's just go. Please, Jesse. I can't be late for this meeting. All right! Come on, baby! Say it! Talk to me, baby! Say it! Mexico! Let's go to Mexico and have a baby! We'll see. Try to understand me, Jesse. I have to think about the future. The future? Yeah. I heard about it. Never seen it. - Sounds like bullshit to me. - Stop calling what I wanna do bullshit! What you do is bullshit, too! Bullshit it is! The future's Mexico! Say it. Mjico. Mjico! Mjico! How long is this hole-diggin' shindig gonna last? About an hour. There is a sidewalk caf down the way. Why don't you meet me there? I'll be there, baby. Officer!

I won't be able to give you the money till next week. You fat fuck! What about you, Mr Jack Burns? What time is it? Five o'clock yet? - I got ten after five. - Where's the phone? Wait a minute.

I can sell this car to 50 other guys! - Hey, Pancho, where's the jumper? - Don't ask me, man. Ask the boss. OK, Birnbaum. Don't fuck with me! Why don't you take a walk, punk? - You stole my jumper, scumbag! - What are you gonna do? Call the cops? OK! I can't breathe! It's in my shorts, OK? It's in my shorts! The moolah's in the cooler! This is for my taxi, you little tar! Hey, boss, what's goin' on? Are you all right? Do I look all right, dickhead? Get him! Get that fuck! Over there, you bean-head! That way! Just don't turn around.

You're in love with him? - Are you in love with him? - I don't know! Oh, Jesus Christ! What do you mean you don't know? Are you young? Look, do you know what you're doing? Let's say he's around here. If he's here, you'll lead the cops to him. Want every cop in the world here? Wait! This is that crazy man from the classroom? The lunatic that broke in? What is this? You're crazy! Monica, do you understand that you can ruin your life with a guy like this? It's not like that. You don't know. - What? - You don't know me. No, I guess I don't, I guess. Listen, Paul. I wish I had time to explain, but I have to go. I'm sorry. Monica! Monica, if you ever need a place to hide out or anything. What's going on? Monica! Ain't you happy to see me, sugar? You! Police! I see you! I'm talking to you! Don't try to pretend! Why are you following me? Because you are looking for a tremendous amount of trouble! I didn't do anything. Your boyfriend just killed a cop and you know where he is. - So you might as well tell us. - He's gone to San Francisco! - You gonna get deported? - That's my girl! - I told you the truth! He's gone! - Let me tell you the truth! You don't play ball with us, you're on the next Concorde outta here! We're trying to help you, but you gotta start helping us. We got a witness who saw you with Lujack an hour ago. He must be around here somewhere. When did you last see him? Jesus! Hey! You! You comin' or not? Mexico! Mexico! Mjico! - Hey, man! Watch it! - Check your oil, man? Get the stuff out of the back window. I can't see. The cop! He's running to the telephone box! - What do we do now? - Now we go get the money. Get rid of this heap.

Sounds good. You, me, the muchacho. Yeah. You, me, the baby. The grass house, the sea. You got it, darlin'. You got it. And there is nothing else. Everything else goes away. There ain't nothin' else. That's it. Love is the power supreme! That's the whole story, baby! Damn! Look at her dance! Hey, Berrutti! Ray, he's cool. He's cool. Maybe I should say "He's hot!" Maybe the word is lucky. Is that the word, kid? Finally! The word is jinxed, my friend. I'm in a jam. Hey, Stretch. Why don't you take this little lady for a nice dance? - Come on, little lady. - Have fun. What do you need, pal? You need help at the border? - Clean cheque I gotta cash. - Jerk gives you a cheque, huh? Well, this'll have to be tomorrow morning. - No, tonight. Now. - I don't have enough cash tonight. Where'd you get those pants? Disguising yourself as an asshole? How many times have I told you that style counts? I'm gonna give you this jacket. Put you in style. Make you feel a lot better. Ain't that beautiful? What's that look on your face? - Love, I guess. - Oh, what a drag! Listen, pal, got a place to stay? - Cops, cops. Which way out of here? - Over there. Cops, cops, cops. Do you know The Pines? - 8.30 in the morning. OK? - You got it, pal. Just jump on. Here's all I got. - There's the girl! - There's Lujack with her! - Hold it! Police! - Monica! Get 'em! Get 'em! The elevator! They're going down in the elevator! I got 'em down here! Come on, Lujack, we got you! Don't shoot! He's got the girl with him! Run! Run! Take care of each other When love walks in the room Everybody stand up Oh, it's good, good, good Like Brigitte Bardot! - Stop! What are you doing? - Faster, faster! He's right there! - Let me outta here! Come on! - Shut up! Faster! Look at you - steering a getaway car! Scared? Yeah. - But you like it, don't you? - Yeah! Don't stop now! You got them! Ram him! Ram him! Turn the goddamn wheel! Me and you Every night, every day We'll be together Always this way Your eyes are blue Like the heavens above Talk to me, darlin' With a message of love The cops! The cops! Police officers! Freeze! When love walks in the room Everybody stand up Oh, it's good, good, good - What do you see? - Nah. There's nothing down there. - Do you want onions? - Sure. - Cost you a nickel more. - Movie! - Never mind the onions. - Hold the onions. What a fool I was to think we could buck Las Vegas. We just ran into a bad streak, that's all. - Are we safe now? - I think so. We have to stay here a while. We've still got a tankful of gas anyway. Bart, do you know what I was talking about? Now I know why it's all or nothing with you. Having fun? What a joint. No more hot water. Look at you. You're a knockout, kid! Bart, I want things. A lot of things. Big things. I don't want to be afraid of life or anything else. I told you I was no good... I don't wanna be afraid of life or anything else. You don't have to be afraid of nothing. I'll hock my guns. That'll give us enough dough to make a new start. There isn't enough money in those guns for the kind of start I want. I want a guy with spirit and guts! A guy who can laugh at anything or do anything. A guy that can kick over the traces and win the world for me! I wanna make love to you! Monica, are you crazy? So what? So I like it! Come on, Bart. Let's finish it the way we started it - on the level. Open your eyes. See anything you like? - This one? - The red one? Eldorado! - What is this place? - This is where Berrutti'll meet us. Call it The Pines. You ever hear of Errol Flynn? Famous crazy fucker and movie star. This was his spread. - This is where we stay tonight? - No, up at the top. Right by the pool. Got the honeymoon suite with a view! - What does jinx mean? - What? Your friend back there - you told him you were jinxed. Jinxed means you got the devil's blessing. Ever seen the devil? How much money will you get from Berrutti? Enough for a while. What will we do in Mexico when the money is finished? Get more! Keep goin'! Money's my middle name, baby! How do we get more? Become thieves? I don't know. What do you keep asking me these questions for? About the future, which I don't know, you don't know! Nobody knows it! So fuck it, roll the dice! Jesse? - Jesse? - What? I just wanted to say good morning. So far so good. - What are you doing? - Examining these plugs. The pimp that owned this thing must have treated it like a piece of shit! - Jesse? - What? Tell me you love me. Yeah, sure I do, sugar. Damn it! Do me a favour, pumpkin. Go down and get us a carton of milk, some Ding Dongs and a newspaper. Get yourself something, too. Gonna be your last American food for a while, baby. Come on, honey. Don't be down. We're just getting to the good part. Step on it. Berrutti's gonna be here in 20 minutes. We gotta vamoose outta these parts. Jesse. Shit! What? Nothing. Just looking at you. I've seen you someplace before. What? - Are you on a TV show? - No. On a quiz show, huh? Let's Make a Deal, right? No. Thanks. I'll think of it. Oh, merde! Hey, hop in. We'll meet Berrutti down by the gate. - Where's my newspaper? - I can't go with you, Jesse. Not now, sugar. Come on. What's wrong? I called the police. I told them you were here. What the fuck for? - It don't make any sense! - It makes sense! No, it doesn't. - Monica, you love me. - I don't want to love you! I don't want to go with you! Just now when I went down the hill, I wanted to keep going on. I was not gonna come back. You love me. You say it! I was not going to come back! But I knew you would come after me and I knew you wouldn't stop coming after me! - But you love me! Now say it! - It doesn't matter if I... - Say it! - It doesn't matter if I love you! It's wrong for us. You don't see, but I can't stop you, Jesse. You're damn right you can't stop me. That's why I called the police - so that you would have to go! Go, Jesse, please! Quickly! All right. You say you don't love me. Then I'll go. You gotta say it. Say it and I'll go. It's easy. Go on. Say it. You can't say it, can you? I don't love you. You liar. - My little liar! - Please, Jesse. My God! Berrutti! We can still make it, darlin'! I know a hundred ways out of this town! I'll be right back! Berrutti! Get outta here quick! The little French girl called the cops! - Get in the car, man! - I can't leave her, Tony. Are you crazy, man? The broad turned you in! You're gonna blow it all! You know me, Tony. All or nothin'. We got the money! It's all the way now, baby! Look, pal. This is all I can do for you now. - Adis, amigo! - You're whacked out of your skull! Jesse! Freeze! Don't do it! You'll be chopped meat! Put up your hands! Let's see your hands!
