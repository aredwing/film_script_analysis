Yes, I can hear you are breathing hard. I can't understand that. You have heart condition and yet you take duties. Why? You should run away from here, but you work thing you don't have. - What's name of that tattoo guy from room 5? - I think Bora, or something. - Why? What happened? - It looks like he caught gonorrhea somewhere. Marbles. From our stand point, it's the least we could give to him. That's all. There wasn't anything else interesting. I'll go to check little Calimero. Good bye. It's Grujic, Dr. on duty. Is consultation today? Damn, is it normal for me to come half an hour before nurse on duty? Who is she? - Dear lord, how they don't get bored? As if we all don't know they are fucking for years. - What? Manager and Slavica. He drives her to work, than he waits a little bit and than he comes out. Please, I'm new here. I'd like to do my job and I'm not interested in hospital gossips. Is that clear? - Why are you smoking? - It' very cold out. Smoking is not allowed in hospital. You'll have to speak louder, I can't hear you. You have sent patient Rejepi... Halil Rejepi. He was sent last night? When? He should be here already? Where from? Wait man... Can't you see that I'm on long distance call? - You shouldn't have... - It's not me, your mom sent you that. Yeah, as my mom would buy me a book... - I'm going. Look after yourself, you see that heating is poor. - I'm ok. - These are very old plums. - I don't care. - If I take care of this, it blows there, see? - In part for children, temperature must be 18 C. In this hospital everything is gone to hell.. Slavica! I can't find my strainer... - See what you have done to me... - Did you watch: Closely controlled trains? - I didn't. - You have divine little ass. You are insane. - 3..2..2... - Line 104... -Andjelka, I'll beat a crap out of you... - Let me go... What a fuck is with you? - You gave it to me... - What are you talking about? You gave me gonorrhea... Bora, take a call. Yes, Ljilja, it's Bora here. I'll have to stay here few more days. Some things gone bad. Nothing serious... Young doctor has to start somewhere. This might be easiest way. And if you have strange or very serious case, ask elder colleagues for advice. Don't be vain. - Sorry, I just want to ask something... - Who permitted you to enter? - I was told that you have information. - I don't know anything about that... What shell I do? - Don't follow me... - Is that for Rejepi? - Yes! - They called for him this morning. There you go! Take this! I'm gone! Rejepi! Is Rejepi here? What?! I want you to tell me what am I doing?! You are behaving indecently. In front of all that people... He was fooling around. He always do that. Is that way you are thanking me for everything I did for you? Do you hear me? What am I doing? What have you seen? That is something inside you. Something you'll never leave behind. How long you are going to torture me? - Dr. on duty, please. - What you said? - Dr. Danka Uskokovic from reception. - Ahh... You are the new one? Yes, I'm the new one. Professor Kenigsmark told me that I can call you in an emergency situation. Well, it depends what you are thinking when you say: Call... - Don't fool around. Situation is serious. - Of course, Danka... Danka, is it? It would be necessary to come down and take a look. Why don't you come to me? That is impossible. He is in very serious condition. He says: Su... I'm very sorry... Maybe you could describe symptoms to me... He looks really bad. Mumbling, unconscious. He has something on his face blisters alike... Slavica, lift the sheet a bit. Unbutton him. - What's this? Where is his chart? - We've just received him. - And who are you? - She is the new one. Ah...yes, yes, yes... You are... - Dr. Grujic, explain to us what is it. - I don't know. - How do you mean? - I havent seen him before. Dr on duty sees patient for the first time and he has no idea what's wrong with him... Don't let patients to hear you. Let's see then... It's clear that it is febrile condition. Take off your knickers a bit. Browses, blisters. Excellent. Who's going to tell us what is it? This is perfect example of toxi-alergic reaction to drugs... ...allergic reaction to penicillin. Take a good look. It's not very often. How is it, Calimero? Very good, comrade Manager. - Any changes? - Well, dr. Markovic didn't tell me... - Shorter! - There isn't. Danka, I'm dr. Grujic. Please forgive me. If I new that patient looks like this, I would came immediately. - I told you so. - And if I knew how you are looking, I would run. Gonorrhea, ha? Like you care... Are you nuts? Comrade manager, I can't deal with someone else's bad work. I'm stoker, not technician... - Do you have something by Chernishevsky? - No, but I could suggest Erotica, French stuff. Rubbish! You should get Russian classics so people would have something to read! But no one wants that! At the same time, I sell everything about Dzajic. (famous soccer player) - Is that all you think about, doctor? - You'll see tonight what I'm thinking about. Don't even think about that... - What's that? - Something about Rejepi, guy that never came. I have to go... What are you saying? What: Dry? What: Wa...? Wa-ter? You want water? I'll get it right now. He wants water. Don't he wants something in cash, maybe? Lets play cards. Poker. Wow, he is so thirsty... Fucking heating... - What are you doing here? Who let you to walk? - Who says I'm walking. I'm taking him to the toilet. - Is that your job? - He is sick. You just keep screwing around. You'll be back at children section. Can't you hold it until you come to the toilet? Wait, wait. He is spitting blood. See. Surgery? This is Grujic from general... Look, I have one ulcer perforation. Yes, blisters and spitting blood. Wait until I ask. - Slavica, blood pressure? - Normal. It's normal... Well I don't know how... Is it really normal? It should be lower because internal bleeding. It's normal, come and see. It's normal. You don't think it's ulcer... Well, he has some penicillin allergy, but that can't be reason for internal bleeding. I thought to give him to you to operate him since he lost a lot of blood. You think it's pointless? Ok, lets wait till morning. Bye! He's sleeping. Doctor, lets be serious. -No! - Slavica! - No! - No! - No! - No! - But Slavica, we are just fucking, no feelings. Just sex, not holding of lovers. NO!!! Slavica, whats wrong with you tonight? I love him. He's never going to be divorced. He gave you little apartment so he could have place to fuck you. His old lady is used to have sex once a month. Come on... He is sitting in parliament club, playing cards with hot shots. He's just screwing you around. - Doctor, doctor. - What? What? What do you want? - We didn't want to disturb you, but because of Calimero... - Oh, you are so naive! - Doctor, the new patient ran away. - True, we don't know... I always get into some kind of shit! But always! - Where is the one from here? - Doctor? - What? - Blood... Take him in the elevator! We have to go to surgery... I'll go for cars. In interest of science it would be good to give him an autopsy, but it's your free will. Halil is going home with us. Gentleman, the last case of variola vera, or smallpox... ...took place here in 1930. I am the only survivor from all medicine crew in that military hospital. Crippled, but alive! They just shown medical findings to me. And now, it's up to me to judge if it is variola. That can't be serious! If there is even slight suspicion, whole region must be surrounded. Military if it is necessary! No one mustn't come out. Triple vaccines if it's necessary! And after that you take analysis! Variola is dangerous. It's not something to play with! We can't block anything until we have analysis from epidemiologic team. To late. If it is variola, it will be to late. It's enough just one man to get out from surroundings. - But we only have suspicion, and that is not enough to make surroundings, you just said... Suspicion? That's enough! Dear member of academy, Mr. Kostic, I deeply appreciate your experience... ...and your contribution to science. I'm aware that you are the only one who has seen variola... and thats why you are here. To see medical findings, not to order measures to take. I will repeat: Make absolute surroundings at once! Unless, someone already is out. Good bye, and let the God be with you! - Danka, what are you doing here? - Hello, uncle. I'm just passing this way... Listen, call me. We need to talk. By all means! Hey, the end of queue is back there. - Nope. Book abut disease is taken. - How's that? Just while ago. If you want we could go to the cellar, maybe you'll find something like that... - Thank you, you are very kind. - Everything for you...Danka... - How do you know my name? - I know everything about you. We were studying together. I was looking at you but you didn't notice me. You were occupied with studying, practice, always in a hurry... I failed on third year because Kenigsmark, works with you at the hospital, didnt' gave permission for exam in ethics. - How do you know where I work? - I told you I know everything. He refused to let me because of may invention. Herpes vaccine I tried on my black friend. He wasn't African, just black and he wanted to become white. And that my friend took vaccine by his free will, I have that in writing. But there was one big white mark on his back and Kenigsmark refused to let me... I don't care. Im fine here, in library. You have beautiful hair. He took book about diseases. Yes... please... yes... yes... I was just informed from the institute for viruses that variola was founded. Word is about Rejepi, patient in General hospital in Belgrade, that died on 9th this month. Time of his death was 00:11 am. Considering that patient was infected and that he was in Belgrade... ...I have decided to establish headquarters for quarantine diseases. For chief of stuff I'm appointing MD Jovanovic. Comrade Jovanovic, take over this meeting. In this moment of crises, we must take extraordinary measures. There are two main goals. We must find everyone who had direct contact with Rejepi, and we must isolate them. Stojan, where is Danka? Why didn't she called me, for Gods sake?! Beside that, we have third goal, perhaps most important. We mustn't allow that information and rumors about possibility of infection create atmosphere of panic in population. These things mustnt become weapon to enemies of our country and our system. Therefore, I forbid you to give information of any kind! - Your uncle called several times. - I supposed to call him. Transfer his calls to my line. I have to go... No, don't come here. They are going to let me out tomorrow. You want to come? No, no, no, sit at home, watch TV. There is something... I read TV schedule just now, I can' remember... You have fever. Why don't you tell me? - It's not that bad, I'm fine... - I told you not to get up... Heating just stopped. They think it's spring. See how cold it is! Dr. Uskokovics office? Just a moment... All keys! Right now. - You! Shut the window! - What? What is going on? - You heard me. Shut the window! - As if... Wait, let me explain you. I'm book salesman, I... - What are you doing? - 80 pieces of vaccine from Zagreb. Sign here. - What from Zagreb? - Why didn't you sent us gamma globulin? - I don't know. - 80 pieces is too little, there are over 150 people here. Who is going to sign? Oh, it's you comrade Jovanovic. I can't hear you! Where are you? I'm near. By decision nr. 652/2 made by Ministry for work and social politics, your hospital is quarantined. No one can't come out or come in the building until further notice. - Doctor? - No one can leave room until I come back. Why me? I cant sign that, I'm just a stoker. Comrade, you can't come here. It's forbidden. Easy, easy! Stop! You are all going to make a call! This is not in listing. - You realize now that you have had to come that night! - You seemed so resentful... You are an idiot! It broke down! Can't you see what have you done? Savages... I'd like to speak with comrade secretary... You think they cut it? Falcon, this is sparrow, can you hear me, over? Falcon here, I hear you loud and clear, over. - Finish this! - Understand, over. Quiet! Quiet for a moment! There is not enough vaccine for everybody. They promised to get it for us from abroad. Therefore it is essential to establish priorities. - What do you want? Always to be in command? - And what if I have been infected?! At this point we can't say for anyone if he is infected or not. Regulations are clear. We have to take vaccines because there is possibility of despise. That's all! I can' take vaccine because of my illness. There are some people we can't vaccine because of their prior diseases. I have flue. My throat each. It's over you old sack. It would be better if someone younger got vaccine. - What? It's not going to hurt! Why are you chicken? - I'm not. - Have you seen dr. Markovic? - She is on duty. Dr. Grujic didn't wanted. He says that under new circumstances old schedule is worthless. - Dr. Kenigsmark, do you want me to pickle you now? - Well, I'm not on the list of those who had contact. - Doctor, let me explain you. I've just arrived. Selling was bad on ER... - Sorry, can't help you. The first one did not take. And yours? - Listen, you can't stay here. - Why? - What would people say, and... - And... - You were in contact with him. With one that... I wonder for what is that? She's got very big fever. - Yes, she called manager all night long. - You haven't slept at all. Chole, open. It's me, Dragutin. - What? - Open! - What do you need? - Open. Little Calimero is getting worse. - I'm not going to open! Doctor, it's your turn. - She arrived... - Who? - Who arrived? - She. Queen of spades. Well, bookman, write one... - Ghonoreaman, bring that brandy. - What, what? - Don't play dumb! - Do you have Plague by Camus? - No, but I have Death is coming, SF. Good evening. They sent me here. I'll help you. - What were you giving to him. - Cortical-steroids. That reduced his immunity. - Are you sure? - Yes I am. That is variola. - I know that you are epidemiologist, but how can you be so sure? - I spent 2 years in Africa. I was working in UN team that tried to stop variola. This boy is hopeless. He will die very soon. It's necessary to close all rooms where he was and disinfect all objects he touched. I'll manage to send you Lysol and Chloramines right now. - That means almost whole second floor? - I'm sorry, there is no other option. Evacuate healthy people from that floor. Procedure with corps is special. - Do you want to send some massage to your family? - I don't know. They already know everything. - Good night, we will meet tomorrow. - Good night. No one is allowed to leave this ward. I'll get everything we need. Sit. Open the door, dr. Ciric. Everyone is leaving this floor. Open the door. That's not reasonable! Dr. Ciric doesn't want to leave the floor. Calimeros condition is critical. He has terrible archealges. He can't swallow any more. You are not protected and you can't help anymore. Please, leave the floor. For everyones sake. - Someone of ladies and gentleman could help. We dropped dead because of the smell. - I have terrible headache. - I've had call from very high position this morning. - Yes? Are you aware that western print and people in the city are talking that we sacrificed whole hospital to stop variola? Rubbish! - Only the measures for epidemic protection were taken. - Yeah... And what if public finds out that you have locked the doors of General hospital... that you gave them one, and only one epidemiologist to fight disease... that could start to spread. Vlada, main entrance. I know whats troubling you. It's your niece that can't out. But, think what would public say if they knew that we release politicians relatives from quarantine. Changes are blurry at first, than they are vesicles and than comes popping of ulcers. By the density of ulcers we differ light, middle and heavy form of disease. This is the heaviest, confluent form of measles. -Measles? - Yes. By now I have found 9 modifications of variola. Rejepi hadn't typical form, easy to diagnose. - And what are the measures? - Except isolation, there aren't any. - There must be something... - Professor, variola is eradicated disease. For a long time no one thinks of variola. - Who was that? - Calimero. He came here long time ago. Doctor, come to see Slavica. Wait, wait! I just want to tell you something. I think that it's about time to come upstairs. No, I don't want. You work if you want, I won't. - You were always saying that you work your ass of. Here is your chance. - Chole! Chole! - You are manager, chief. What's left to others if you don't want? - No, I won't - Is that understood. You go if you are crazy. Drop dead if you want Why do you need me? She is there. Slavica. Why Dr. Ciric hates me? When I pass by, she turns her head to the other side. She doesn't want to say: Hello. On purpose! We know each other for 30 years. From the German camp. We were in camp Banjica. Even than she was tormenting me. Do you know what was the first thing she did when we got out? She denounced me to committee for bad conducting. And you know what they said? Give us a proof. She couldn't prove anything, but she is tormenting me systematically. Like Chinese torture! Chole, lets go upstairs... You wanted to trick me! Thats what you wanted. Pardon, pardon. Excuse me please. - Oooh, little miss minister's wife... What's new? - Let people sleep. What? What you are looking at? That guy died on my hands. Not yours. What? What you are looking at? Dancing bear? Get away! Get out, you fucking piece of pussy. You are going to die in there. Stinky! You'll be forgotten by waiters in parliament club, you sado-marxist (Refers to Carl Marx). Come out to see how pockmarked we are. Booo! Get out, you piece of trash! Your mistress is dying and you are not able to come, pussy. One explanation, please. Vagina: that's anatomy; Pussy: that's distinctive feature! You are stealing morphine? You bloody drug addict! Run! You think I don't know that you are doing that for years?! - Dr. Grujic, is that you? - Yes, it's me. - Why don't they turn on the lights? - It's turned on. How's that? - Why Chole didn't come to visit me? - He couldn't. He was busy. Will you tell him to come? I will. Back! Get back! Back! Get back! - What is with you Grujic? Are you nuts? - Consider yourself imprisoned. - Bora! Don't let him pass there! - What's going on? Move, move, move away! Where to, chief? Your way, Doctor! Grujic, what are you doing?! - They gone mad! - When did you received this? - What is that? - He was hiding from us hyper immune gamma globulin. - They sent us just 40 grams, that's not enough... You stole this from my children? Explain them please. Tell them that 40 grams isn't enough even for one room. Tell them! Professor and I need help of volunteers. Number of infected is to big for just two of us. You are not suitable. You can't be vaccinated. Is there anyone? Take him! Get out! Get back! Don't come near! - Get him back! - Get out! - Let me explain. They are forcing me out. Dr. come to see... What are you doing. Nothing. I'm vaccinating myself. - But that is normal vaccine... - A bit of gamma globulin we had, we gave to the children. Are you nuts? Why that child of all people in the world? Don't leave quarantine. That's in general interest. Regulations about quarantine diseases are strict. You must stay in there for 21 days after last case of disease. So get back in hospital and wait patiently for the danger to pass. - Where is Chole? - He's coming. Get back to quarantine! Get back to quarantine! At last! I was so eager to see you. How you came in? - You are CRAZY! You won't be able to get out! - I don't mind. If it is for you... You idiot! Idiot! Praying. - So that's that expert? - Yes, Vlada, that's comrade Jovanovic. - Let me explain the situation to you? - What are you going to explain?! Whole Belgrade talks about that helicopter. You are making show... - Just let me... - Shut up while I'm talking! No more secrets! I want public to be fully informed! Our tourist season is gone to hell. Italian and Spanish papers are full of variola and you play conspiracy. Are you stupid? Situation was like that. I've just been to quarantines Centar and Avala... - You want to say that you were with variola patients? - Yes. An hour ago. - Today? - Now? - Yes. And I can tell you that disease is spreading on several locations, everywhere Rejepi was... Lets make a deal. I'll get you out from this situation, but you must make some effort... - What? - You'll get her out of there any way you know! Television report about vaccination. Mile, are you there? Oh dear God, why don't you turn on heating? It's cold even here... Light ball broke... Mile... Don't touch him! Let him! - What are you looking for? Some tranquilizers. I haven't slept whole night. I don't have that... They are not normal... They sole everything... Can I put this here? - You can't. - Just until I find safer place. Day or two. - You can't an that is it. - Put that down! - Haven't you heard me? - Don't do that! - Stop, don't do that. Don't Erotica? - What? What Erotica?! Don't come near me! I can't take it anymore! - Who is Dr. Uskokovic? - It's me. They sent you some things from home. Take it. There is a letter in there. Read it carefully. His skin is completely carbonized. I have to tell you something. We don't know well each other. I'm afraid that I'm going to be misunderstood. You could notice that my attitude about everything never was under question mark. I was the last one to take vaccine. I fought as much as I could. But I'm broken since that happen to Grujic. I don't know if you can understand that. Everything is gone...faith...motives... everything I taught my students... I have to quit. I have to leave. I can't take it anymore. Colleague, I'll speak freely. By the things I have seen in Africa, mortality is about 60%. Oh, you can't see the light because of me? There is something interesting. All cases with deadly ending here... were the cases with patients that were taking drugs that reduces immunity... or with people that were never vaccinated. You have vaccine scar and they gives us some hope. If you manage to survive next faze of disease, chances for surviving are very good. Do you want to bet? I'm in with a bottle of Chivas whiskey from 1963. That young girl doesn't allow entrance. Be prepared tomorrow. Dr, please hear me. Look at me. I'm not a patient... He is reading poetry Stop it, please. I hate poetry. I don't like it either. I'm more interested in SF and horror. You know what i decided? I'm gathering inspiration for my first novel, medical SF, In the Claws of Disease. - Something between Camus and Isaac Asimov. - Stop for once! Listen to me... - I'm getting out of here. - How? Just like that. Forever! Why are you thinking about death when I'm here with you? I'm going out! Not dying! Running away! Understand? Dr. tell him to go. (Child is calling mother.) - To who? - That's Zagas son, he is yelling for an hour. - Zaga? Is that nurse who had break down? - She doesn't want to see anyone, eve her son... Give this to her. Dr. I'm not nurse or Dr. but if you need help upstairs, I can do anything. Of course we need help. Thank you very much. - They came for Mile. - Who is Mile? - Mile the stoker. Oh, my God. You can' imagine hi suffering. I realize what Kenigsmar thought when he said that our occupation is bunch of half-lies and ignorance. And he said that... My left hand is warm, and right one is like stone. Isn't it? What is it? Dushko! - What is it? - It's heart! Quickly! - Adrenalin! - Where is it? - Upstairs! Quickly! - Wow, how big space it is in here... - Out!!! - Mask, quickly! - What? - That green thing, quickly! - Here it is. - On 3, press it on 3! - Where? - There! - Ok. Needle, quickly, needle! Here it is. Come on, come on... It works, Just a little more, come on! You did it! - Aren't you out? - Someone needed more to get out. - Who is it? - Tell them that Dr Markovic had heart attack and that she is in ambulance. Doctor, what shell I do? Wait for me here. - Who turned off the lights? - It was me, Doctor. Bora. You don't need it. - What are you doing here? - I'm taking care of you. - You? - I've got bored down there so I volunteered. Doctor! You are crazy gonorrhea bastard! - How are you? - And you? It itches like hell. - Find that vampire and tell him to bring the whiskey. - Don't ask me twice. I look very nice, don't I? Looks were never your main feature. Fly... Spring is coming. - Professor, Grujic wants to see you. - What are you trying to say? He wanted to eat, but I don't know can he, because of his internal organs. Are you aware what you are saying? - Bookman, catch! - Where did you find this? This one is on Dr. Grujic. What is it kittens? No fucking without doping? Go to hell! You silly fool... I think that we closed first round. For 17 days there weren't new cases... ...and for four days no one died. Some of the patients started to lose blisters. We have to wait 21st day. If there were new cases, that would mean that the second round of disease started. - It looks like epidemic stopped. - Yes, it looks like that. Epidemic stops as it starts, without reasons and without logic. Wait. That means that in three days everything will be over? - That's right. Does it means that danger is over? Theoretically: No. Practically: Yes. - Have you seen Dushko? - The blond one? He is on the roof. Tanning. I have something nice to tell you. Hey! Death is as natural as life is. It's all about + and -. One is for life, other for death. Cause of death in case of variola is heavy intoxication and massive internal bleeding from hemorrhage diathesis. Couldnt this be from thrombosis? One thin is sure. It is not variola vera. - What is cause of death? - I don't know. - I thought... Well that's rubbish. - What? I thought that variola changed...That variola became something else, as soon as we won. Colleague, I think that autopsy clearly shows that cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage. Do you agree? You can write anything you want. This man didn't die because of variola. Dr. Uskokovic, when we get out from here I'll take you to dinner in Writers club. You survived variola. You have scars. - We have to inform people that everything is over. - But why did you...? Why were you wearing that suite? You are immune. Suit was because of psychological effect. Not for you, but for those outside. Before we start to answer questions, allow me to read you letter we just received from World Health Organization. Dear friends, I'm honored to inform you that we gave you golden olive branch... ...award we give every year for exceptional successes in fighting quarantine diseases. Your unselfish work stopped spreading terrible disease on the very edge of Europe. You prevented great catastrophe. Your courage will be an example for generations to come. Signed by the president of World Health Organization. Please stand up for minute of silence for all victims of variola vera.
