Great leaders fought against them and became martyrs for the motherland. But still some smaller kings like Palayars supported the British empire. This is a fictionalized story about one of those Palayars. 1771 A.D. - Chozhapuram Palayam Midnight, Owls howling time King Mokkayappar Minister Sangilimayan Palace Guard Palace lizard Brother-in-law, l'm anxious.

Shouldn't l need a heirto it? Prime Minister, a boy baby is born. Wow! Happy news! We have a Prince... Twins? -Yes, Minister. l can usurp this kingdom if there's only one child who will grow at my command. Doctor, don't reveal to the King about child birth till l tell you. Who is there? Prime Minister, l've studied the horoscopes of the twins. l'll briefly explain it to you. Elder one follows orders blindly. And younger one is sagacious. Stupid law gives the right to rule kingdom only to legal heirs. There is no chance for people like me to rule it. A prince is born. He must dance to my tunes only. Blind follower of orders and Sagacious! To fulfill my plan of usurping this kingdom, l want the elder one, who blindly follows orders. Doctor, kill the second child. Prime Minister!?-What?

We are staying 18 miles away from the palace. So? We are moving to Kanchipuram shortly. Hubby, we don't have children. Let's fosterthis child. My dear citizens, After losing 22 children, Now God has blessed me with this 23rd child. He is an answerto umpteen prayers of this kingdom. Once when l went to meet Hyder Ali, On the way, l visited 'Pulikesinathan' temple, offered prayers there wishing for a son. Since he was born with Lord's blessings, l give him the name 23rd Pulikesi. l think an insect has bitten him. What the hell are you doing without taking care of him?

Oh really! So, you're very interested to sacrifice life. - That's in our blood, my Lord. Do one thing. -Waiting foryour order, my lord. l'll give you rope. Get yourself hanged in that. You can easily sacrifice your life. You don't know the difference between bravery & statesmanship. You do get your monthly salary, don't you? Get the salary & keep quiet. Or else go home & sleep.

What bloody name is that? My dear 23rd Pulikesi may you live long! May your Kingdom expand! Will he always call me by name? - That's the arrogance of every poet. ls it?-Yes. Reason for coming here? To sing my new poetry to you and get rewards. Reward...? Sing... Sing your shit! O my lord! You're a PlMP. You're a SCOUNDREL. ln politics, you're a KlNG OF lDlOTS. Forthe poor, you're a STUPlD. Keep your doors open & help the NEEDY. When you see your enemies army, you become a WASTREL. USELESS. You're the BLACK CROW. Stop it you Onandi... How dare you play with a lion's mane in its own den? What is my fault, my lord? Why did you abuse me? -Abuse you? l sang poetry in praising you. What is he blabbering? Why did you abuse the King without giving a break? But when?- Stop lying. You called him ''Mama Manna'' (PlMP). lt means Lord of Lords. You called him ''Mollamari''. - lt means rain. l compared him to the rain. You called me ''Mudichavukki''. - lt means you open knots of problems easily. You called him ''Mooda''. - Connect with the next sentence. lt means that his doors are always open forthe needy. What about ''Punnakku''? - lt means to destroy the enemies. What else did he say? Minister...-Yes, my lord. - This time he can't escape.-Yes. What do you mean by ''Andankakka'' (Black Crow)? lt means saviour of this universe. Does it mean that way? - That's what l meant. No way. l can't accept your explanations. No rewards foryou. Better leave now before you're kicked out. My Lord...-Yes. Don't force me to curse you, my lord. l'm elderto you, listen to me. There is a limit to everything. How dare you talk against me? Your eyes will pop out now. Throw snuff powder on his face. - This is injustice. But this is justice to me. Sprinkle well. Hey you poet! Only foryou, it is snuff powder. For any other poet who comes here, it is going to be chilly powder. O you arrogant King! You will fall. -Who is there to bring down my fall? Let's break the locked prisons... Let's start a revolution... Let's break the locked prisons... Let's start a revolution... The rising sun will wipe away darkness & give light... Questions will be raised against the government... lt will bring down the governments... Gone are the days of slavery... Why fear? Have courage & face the difficulties... Everything is for the public... This is our law... Everyone can exercise their rights... No more day dreaming... The world will become one... When the volcano spills lava out, the hills & the mountains go to ashes... The poor suffering at the hands of rich, a new awakening & new dawn is in offing... Look, my son has returned afterfinishing studies at Nalanda University. Son...- Mother. - Do you recognize her? She's feeling shy. Who is she?- She is Vasantha Soundari, Sundara Nachiar uncle's daughter. Oh really! How are you Vasantha? Still playing hide & seek game with me? Oh No! Ukkiraputha, Vasanthi is gone. Please look at me. A crowd is waiting foryou. Surprised! ln short, l'm a revolutionary. What are you saying? -Yes. When l went to Nalanda for my higher studies, A nationalist organization is very active. Young men are trained there to fight the British. l've undergone a year's training there. My next plan is to send you to Tippu's camp in a group of four. There you will be trained in all guerrilla warfare. We must first eliminate puppets who help the British. Who is 23rd Pulikesi? We must kill him who does not respect people's sentiments.- Sure. We are already furious. We will sacrifice our lives forthe cause. -You are a sincere patriot. l'm an extremist revolutionary. Leave him. Give him the bow & the arrow. Your intention was to kill me. l'll give you the opportunity. Use it if you are a true soldier. l'm Sangilimayan who decides every move of this Kingdom. And you're a small ant who dared to stand against me. Who are you? He who sent you is one amongst us, right? Show me who he is. l'll spare your life. Not only that, l will offeryou diamonds, gold... Shit! l'm not like you. l'm not a traitor to pledge my country to the British. l'm not a coward to bend my back either. So, you're one of the revolutionaries. Then, you won't tell the truth even if you die. Not only me, every stone of this palace will support the British. ls there anyone who is against this? This is an iron fortress. Without my knowledge....- Uncle. Nothing can get inside without our knowledge. But if anyone dares to get inside... Looks like only a 8 dot rangoli was put infront of the palace. Won't they put a 16 dot rangoli? Don't make my sword do the work. My lord, don't take swords for rangoli. Leave silly things to me. l'll handle it. My Lord...-Yes. -A message from Vallavarayan. And Bad Smell C. We can sell in the same brand name, right? An English name. Everything can be English inside. But name should be in Tamil. Yes. We are very concerned about it. Call the translator. The name is Sistermala. He found this drink. So, we named the drink after him. What do you mean by ''Sister''? - lt means sister. Whose sister?- My sister. Age?- She will be 60 this September. She is my elder sister. Keep the name as Akkamala. Wow! Another liquor name is ''Bad smell C''. What do you mean by ''Bad smell''. - lt means stink. Keep the name as Gup - C. We are planning advts. forthe drinks with drama stars & sportspersons. Scoundrel! lf we advertise well, our people will drink even urine as tender coconut water. That's our strength. Friend, a small request. -What? Can l wearthat hat once?-Yes. How do l look like?-Wonderful. By letting the foreigners do business in our country, you will be called as ''Pulikesi, who opened the doors of business to foreigners''. Why are looking at me like that? l can sing a poem only when l look at it. Poetry?- Yes. You're my dream... You're a magical moon... Let's go to the world of love... You're the fragrance of gold with a heart of a lion... Come & enjoy this young girl... ln the city of Koodal & at the bank of river Vaigai, come, let's unite... Enchant me with your beautiful poetry... Let's fly to the dreamland of happiness... Let's fly... You're my dream... You're a magical moon... Let's go to the world of love... You're the fragrance of gold with a heart of a lion... Come & enjoy this young girl... O beauty! Your beauty is always mine... My heart will yearn for your embrace... O Angel! l saw Cupid's arrows of love in your eyes... l want you to give me a bath in the river of love... The sound of kisses mesmerizes me... Let our hearts get engulfed in the bliss... Let the kisses get spilled all over us... You're my dream... You're a magical moon... Let's go to the world of love... You're the fragrance of gold with a heart of a lion... Come & enjoy this young girl... Enough poet! l've brought sweet for my beloved. - Really? You nevertold me. What do you want? - For me...? l heard that there are beautiful deer in the forest next to our village. l love them. Will you get me one? No. We shouldn't harm animals. Others hunt them. But l asked you to catch one for me. Only arrogant hunt them. Only capital punishment will stop them from hunting. We got a message from Nixon. -What is it? When he was hunting deer in Sundaravadhana garden yesterday, someone had hit him with a stone and destroyed his chariot.- Oh no! Then? Then his advisortold him that he looked just like you. Our King? Hitting bulls eye...? Our King and hitting bulls eye? No chance. Forgive me my Lord. Sorry for revealing the truth. Stop it. People are here with new issues. Solve them. -What is that new issue? Caste problem. lt will look like a small spark. Blow it to a big fire so that we can warm ourselves in that heat for generations. So, there has been communal clashes amongst yourtwo castes for a decade. Yes my lord. Which caste do you belong to? - Nagapathani caste. And you...?- Nagappathani caste. Confusing me...? Both claim to belong the same caste. But call yourselves different castes. We belong to Nagappathani caste, our name has an extra P. We only belong to Nagapathani caste. They are a new group. So we are the seniors. No, we are the seniors. - No way, we are the seniors. Stop it. People's wish is the King's wish. Guard. ln the vacant land next to the lake, construct a stadium by overnight for people to sit & watch. All communal clashes will be take place there, so that the world will watch it with awe. lsn't there anything to stop them? We can't make them understand. Rajaguru is everything. Only a sword can restrain them. Vallavarayan has threatened to wage a war on us if we support British. He will unleash hell. This isn't important to us. We'll know the consequences only if he ravages us. Hail the King 23rd Pulikesi! Hail our golden son 23rd Pulikesi! Hail our brave King 23rd Pulikesi! Hail the King Pulikesi. KlNG 23rd PULlKESl STADlUM FOR COMMUNAL CLASHES Silence please. So, ourfirst target is Rajaguru and King Pulikesi. Let them be our relatives or siblings, we shouldn't spare anyone. Swearto sacrifice your lives and join this organization. My lord...-Yes. Your body & his head is covered. Why? What's happening here? That body and this head are going to unite. That body & this head...you mean murder. lt is an art & not murder. How can a murder become an art? You always prove yourself to be a foolish Minister. How could this be possible? - Like that. Wow! You seem to be very strong. My lord...-Yes. How did you get this idea? - l will tell you. Everyone knows that l'm an Emperor. But if someone makes a portrait of me, it would look awful.-Yes. l wanted 23rd Pulikesi to be praised in heaven & earth, and must be as strong as a bull. When l was sitting on the pot and thinking, l got this idea of painting my portrait like this. How shrewd l am, right? The future generations will be stunned looking at this portrait. People from the next century won't know how l would look like. History is very important. -Yes my lord. O my lord! Vallavarayan is coming. They come to disturb my thirst for art. Tell him he can't meet the King now. lf possible, l will meet him next month. Right? Vallavarayan has come with his army. Do l need this? Vallavarayan sent messages twice not to pay taxes to the British. You ate the pigeons which carried the message. And now he is with his army standing at our palace gates. Only God knows what else he will do. Awarfor a pigeon..? lt is very bad. He has taken a hasty decision. How can he fight with me? You could've told me that there is no way here. So, you will simply follow wherever l go, ah? Bunch of idiots! There is a well overthere. l can't tolerate you guys. That's one way, my lord. Oh no! l'm in trouble for eating a pigeon. My lord...-Yes. Let your soldiers not know soldiers your weakness. The entire army will lose hope. - ls it? Soldiers, a cloud of war has engulfed our kingdom. Waging a war against Pulikesi! Hey Vallavarayan! l was waiting for a warto take place and l will rip out your skin. ldiot! The horses are raring to gallop. Soldiers! We are tigers. While going to a war, do not run. We have to hide & then pounce. We are lions. We shouldn't roar. Our looks should kill our enemies. We are elephants. We should bend ourselves to them. We must crush them under ourfeet. We are foxes. We shouldn't fight for our prey. lnstead we must kill our enemies. Understood..? Start now. Let our army march. Hail Lord Murugan! Say ''Victory is ours''. Hail Lord Murugan! - ''Victory is ours''. Start now. Why are you so lazy? Move fast. My lord! Please lend me your hand. Am l running high fever? -Yes my lord. Just like me, you are also running high fever. -Are you also running high fever? We hurt no one. Why is this happening to us? Should God play with us only? What sound is that? - Blowing conch.- Conch..? Vallavarayan is very impatient. He might break the walls and enter into the palace. Why are you crying? Are you afraid of the war? Yes my lord. Don't get scared. l'm there with you. You're my man. What's wrong with you? - Nothing my lord. Come.- My lord, you are strong enough, ah? Where is our army of elephants? We sent the elephants on hire for Thiruvaroor King's marriage. ls it? So, there are no elephants in army today? We took money.- Shut up. Are these people ready?-Yes. We must fight well. Once we open the door... What's this? Give that to me. My lord...-What's all this? Where is that blacksmith who made this? Did you call me? Who made this sword? - l made it. Just drag the sword. Here l do. Give that to me. What are you looking into it? When your King is in danger, all swords are broken. What do you have to say about it? Everything is fine. But l didn't get time to repairthem properly. But the enemies have come. What should l do now? Do something.- Sure l will. Chain him & make him lie down there. Let the elephants crush his body when they come back. Guards! My lord... Shall we go? -Wait a minute. Hey Pulikesi... My blood freezes at the noise he makes. What will happen to me if l fight? My lord...-Yes. This is not the time to play. Let anything may happen. Let's march forward. Come out Pulikesi. - He is calling my name again & again. Let's go to the war.-Yes. Soldiers! The time has come. You must be like an arrow shot from a bow. Our entry must demoralize them. Let the victory bugle be blown. God! Save your children. Hail Victory! War...! War...! What's happening, my lord? He is coming with a white flag Stop it, you idiot. Who did he call? - Not us. So, he called me...?! So, the while flag did not work. Pulikesi, l've come to take your head. Take my head? l sent a message with my pigeon not to join hands with the British. How dare you fry my pigeon & eat it? Please do not suspect me. Even l sent a message that l won't pay taxes to the British. But you didn't get it. No l didn't get it. He says he didn't get it. l got a couple of complaints too. What can l do? The pigeons carrying messages are hunted down by the eagles. l've sent men to catch those eagles. The soldiers didn't come back. They never came back. Stop spinning yarns. l will kill you, wastrel! Yes l am a wastrel! You are always right. My lord, please believe me. l'm yourfriend. Please don't be angry on me. l always support you. Please tell him. He is begging. l wouldn't have sent him any message if l knew this. He has no honour. l heard it. We have come with our army to fight him. That's good. Look at his shit face. A big moustache isn't just enough. You coward with a shield. Having come so far, let's pluck out his eyes. Oh my god! Vallavarayan, l want to live. Shit! He has fallen at ourfeet. Let's go. You made Vallavarayan to run from the battlefield. What did you say? Oh no! Who asked them to come here? Since you escaped waving the white flag, you will called as the King of White flag. ls that enough? Let's go back. My lord...-Yes. An army of revolutionaries is formed in our kingdom. For what?- To kill you. -What? Army of revolutionaries to kill me? Enemies in your own country? Who are they? Why do they want to kill you? Again a white flag? Are you watching fun? lf we don't nip it in bud, we may need an axe to cut it then. Any other news?- No, my Lord. King!-Who is there? Our spy has come. King, the news has come immediately. He's my spy, he's very sharp. Minister, we must honour him today. l mean you've decided to increase his salary. Yes.-Yes, my Lord. Get up Minister. Let the spy sit there. Sit here, would you like to have any hot drink? Hot milk?- No Lord. Ginger Coffee?- No Lord. My stomach is upset. Then, you must have a herbal tea? - No lord. Don't you want? Okay. What's that stick in your hand? l'm in a cart driver's disguise, Lord. O Spy! Yourthoughts and works are just like mine. You've proven that you're indeed a worthy chief Spy. lt's all the effect of Elephant's milk l had with you. lt's not elephant's milk, it's milk of wisdom. Elephant!-Wisdom! l give up. Okay, what's the news? King! A calamity is fast approaching us. What calamity? Vallavarayan had sent a pigeon with a letter, right? So what? He's planning to attack us with army as the pigeon didn't return to him. Vallavarayan?-Yes. Attacking us?-Yes, Lord. When is he expected to attack us? Any moment my Lord. Tomorrow... Bloody...damn fool... l told you to get latest news. Will you come with outdated old rotten news? Today, l will...get up. Showing your strength on me? Watch my intelligence now. Save me...it's paining. Tell me the truth, where did you go actually? Forgive me Lord. There was a grand feast in my Uncle's home on the way in Seerkazhi. l enjoyed the feast & their hospitality fortwo days and returned. Did you grace theirfunction?-Yes. Now l'll disgrace you. Boy! What is that? - Tender coconut water. Give me. King. What is this? Tender coconut water, King. Tender coconut water? l'm on fire and you're having coconut water. What are you saying King? l've got news about rebels from thieves close to us. Astonishing! So fast? You're a genius in information & communication. Our meeting must be a secret between us only.- Okay Lord. Come, my Lord. Minister! Why is the horse galloping? l don't know my Lord. Lord, be careful. l could feed the horse only one drug filled coconut, another one...-Another one? King drank it. Let him drink and go to hell. Let the horse run helter skelter. Commander! ls everyone ready there? Yes Commander. Our people are waiting in the forest to kill the King. Great! Our men are coming back from Tippu Sultan's camp. How are we going to dislodge the King and Rajaguru? Dislodge them? l'm doubtful of doing it with the strength we have. Without being foolish like the opposition camp, if we just raise cries of Comradeship always, we can never achieve our aim. Sometimes we must also become schemers like them. We must do it ourselves. Will anyone jump from sky to do it? His Highness... The Mightiest of the mighty... Emperor amongst emperors... King, he forgot to say again, 'Bravest of the brave' l said it right this time, King, totally seven... His Highness... lt's enough if you announce the arrival of the King. No need of lavish praises, it's detrimental to the ruler. All of you please be seated. Minister!- King. Whose statue is that? lt's been here for many years. - l know it. l find it little different today. There's no difference in it King. A gift to us from SirJones, it's the statue of Sir Robert Clive. A mark of our loyalty towards the British Empire. Loyalty? Great! King! Douglas and Gerald are here for an audience with you. King, they are soft drink makers and they are here to give our share. Hello Pulikesi. Hi Mangudi! How are you? Greetings Douglas.-Yeah. My dear Britishers, welcome. This is your share. Just asking you for curiosity, what's the manufacturing cost of a bottle of soft drink? Sold at?- 10 coins a bottle. Why is it sold so expensively? This nation is full of ignorant fools. They will not ask questions and we can mint money. Good, you've understood my citizens very well. No...no...what are you doing man? No...wait...Mr. Pulikesi. No...oh God! Traitors! Bloody beggars, you came in search of a livelihood, are you cheating us? lt's a mistake for allowing you to sell soft drinks here. Are you selling it at higher rates and cheating us? l don't want even a drop of your drink in my land. lf you dare to step into my country again, you'll be dead. Go away. Minister.- King. There's no point in accusing them, bring those who acted as models forthe ads to sell the drinks. As you order Lord. Greetings King. He's stage actor Sevilipandi Bhagavathar. She's stage actress Chellatha. - Greetings King. He's wrestler Sangoli Rajan. - Greetings King. ls it right or wrong to act as models for ads? Tell me. Tell me, is it right or wrong? Won't you answer me? You've been spared because you're a woman. Whiteman is clever, l'm useless, you're selfish, lsn't this your idea? Will you eat anything given on a platter? How are we different from animals? Shouldn't we think logically? Forgive me King. Call the painter, and ask him to do as l order. Enjoy Palmcola like Chellatha! Enjoy fresh tender coconut water! Bloody cowards. Commander! King. Your men failed to kill me, what's your next plan? Excellent! l'll behead you to save my motherland! Commander! l'm not Pulikesi. l'm his brother Ukkiraputhan. Yes, it happened like this. That demon Rajaguru's treachery is breaking our nation. We need a man like you to chastise men like him. Thank God! Pulikesi escaped from us. Make my brotherto do hard labour in gold mines under heavy protection. How can he be a King without knowing the hardships of people he rules? Keep this a secret from my parents too. Who is there? Hey fools! Who is there? l'm Pulikesi the King. They are torturing me more if l say l'm the King. l don't know why l'm in captive and why they are torturing me? l don't mind the torture but please give me some waterto drink. Who is there? Just a while ago we had thrashed you forthese arrogant outbursts, right? Thrash me again but offer me water to drink man or else l'll die man. Then answer my question, l'll give you a pint of water. A pint? Come on ask me. lf you give shirt to uncle, short boy will beat you with a baton. Who is he? Why are you staring at me? l'll repeat it. lf you give shirt to uncle, short boy will beat you with a baton. Answer me man. lf l've to tell you that secret for a glass of water, l don't need it man. Secret? ls it really a secret? Please tell me, l can't bearthe curiosity to know it. Then l'll ask you a question, answerto that question is that secret. ls it? Come on ask me. Thanking the pig, scaled a mount and stood there, you can win over Kulasekhar. What is that? Use brain not weapons. l'll kill you man. ls it a question? Bloody dirty face! l'll rip you apart. Why are you in jail? l'll not confuse like you, l'll tell you clearly.- Tell me. l asked is the gold mine necessary in the condition our nation is now? l was jailed immediately under section KEDA. Who? By the foolish King ruling this country, Pulikesi. People are struggling for gruel, is gold a necessity now? You can say anything sitting here. Only the man sitting on the throne knows where it hurts. This country is prospering underthe golden rule of Pulikesi, the great! lf you belittle him again l'll put you in jail. Bloody criminal! Am l myself in a jail? l went overboard mistaking it for my royal court. l found gold...l found gold. Where did you find gold man?- Here! Why are you pointing at me? How intelligently you spoke to me just a while ago, indeed you're gold. Hey! You are shouting with a scheme. Where is the gold man? Gold? My foot! You denied him water, right? He's making false claims of finding gold to fool you. Throw him in underground cells, quick! When did l claim of finding gold? Look, he's lying again. He's a mad man, poke and torture him. Don't beat me...don't beat me. A King getting beaten up black and blue. They are squeezing me out. Commander! Everything happening here must be brought to our notice. Commander!- King! Why so many fruits have been kept here? Who is celebrating honeymoon here? That is...- Clear it out first. Boy! Come here. Who is this boy? To run errands, King. What? Child labour? So they have sent these children to work in poverty. You've engaged them for lower wages. lsn't it? lt was my idea to Rajaguru to save escalating salary bill. Show me your palm. King...King. ln few days a trunk will grow on yourface. You are growing fat everyday but making little innocent children to work? Bloody stone hearted man. How many steps lead to the palace terrace? Ask him to climb up and down those steps till today's dusk. Let his big tummy know what is work. -Yes King. Children! Why didn't you go to school? No money to pay fees.-What? Children, don't worry, you'll go to school from tomorrow. Commander, let education be made free to every citizen of this nation. The sky will fit into your fist... lf you have the will power... Even mountains will give way... lf you march ahead with an aim... Let there be any obstacle... Let's march ahead... By hook or crook... Do good for your motherland... Provide pension for these girls every month. Let them take up some job and eke out a livelihood. Harem... Children's playground. The word ''NO'' will be removed from the Tamil dictionary... lf we give charity generously, poverty will totally vanish... Our blood & sweat will lift our motherland to new heights... Let love prevail everywhere... God dwells in... the smiles of the poor.... God is in the hand that helps others... FOR COMMUNAL CLASHES. Stop it. lf l had done such a foolish thing, don't you have brains? Shouldn't you've fought against me? Mother... - By God's grace you have reformed. Yourfather's soul will rest in peace looking at your good deeds. Oh my god! How many times should l carry this big stone? lt is rolling down... He is staring at me. What's happening? Walking like an old man! Playing with the stone. What's wrong with you? l think my spine is broken.- ls it? lf you don't work properly, your bones will also break. Go & carry the stone back to the top. - Okay sir. Stop. No one should be permitted inside. Please do not stop us. We will leave after seeing our son. Listen to me, sir. l wonder how he is struggling. Don't cry. We will make a request to our King Pulikesi. l should beat myself with slippers for ordering to find gold in mines. The King who opened this is being squeezed. What can l do? l can't. Wow! Drink. She is not here. Has she left? There she comes. Stop acting. Get up. Good! How did you find that l was acting? Won't my heart know that? -Your heart? lt thrills me from head to toe. What's your name? Go. ''GO''...Wow! What a beautiful name! Your name sounds so sweet! Ms. Go... l said go. Oh l see! What's your name?- Soolayini. Even this name tempts every man. Then?- Enough. Do you want guavas? Guavas...? Are you telling the truth? Here it is. Caught you. Give it to me. Soolayini, we've exchanged our hearts too. l will bite it now itself. Welcome Pulikesi.-Welcome Uncle. l was waiting foryou. When did you return? Just a while ago. How are you, my dear? With your blessing, l'll always be fine. How was your journey? Very fine. The Britishers inquired about you. We are important to them. So, they will inquire about us. -You're right. l heard that in my absence you ruled the kingdom very well. lt is the knowledge which you imparted to me. But still, the change is impeccable. ln this world, change is indispensable. So, you've read Bhagavad Gita too. Why read Gita when l live a life of Lord Krishna? Good. You mean to say that he who lived a life of Allah or he who lives a life of Jesus doesn't have to follow Quran or Bible? Following is different from leading a life of the same. How is my thought?-Wonderful! l heard about the changes you have brought in this kingdom. You've started to lead a life of Lord Buddha. lt's all because of you, uncle. As an Emperor, l thought about something else too. What was that? We will be destroyed if we lead a life of Buddha. So, l need to be a ferocious Buddha. What are you looking at? Showeryour blessings. You can leave. l will also come to the court.- Okay. Becoming ferocious midway and born ferocious has lot of differences. Pulikesi, l am your uncle. Uncle who never likes changes. Why did you hit me the other day? You bad mouthed our King Pulikesi. So l hit you. What bloody Pulikesi? Do not bad mouth him. He is a warrior. l heard a secret about him today morning. What was that? Do you know what he did? -What did he do? Once he went to forest to hunt bears. Do you know what happened there? So, he also knows the secret. Minister...-Yes my lord. Looks like a dense forest.-Yes. Do not forget the path we came. l hear many sounds. What are they? My lord...-Yes. Look there. lt's a bear, right? lt's the same bear which created havoc in the village. lt's tallerthan our horse. - Don't get scared. We can reach the palace in a minute with these horses. Let's run.- Stop being foolish. lf we run away, our soldiers will spread this news & defame us. Just shut up. Bear's eyes... Was ours a hasty decision to get down? No doubt about it. The arrow is pointing towards yourthroat. The beginning is not right. Let's run away. Come. Why are you scaring me? We have an army behind us. Watch now. Watch how l shoot arrows. Minister... My lord, you have wasted 41 arrows. This is the last arrow. Atleast... What are you looking at? l saw you murmuring something. l prayed to God.- Pray. Oh my God! lt caught my arrow. Oh no! Where are they? And where is my horse? The bear is coming towards me. lts coming. What am l to do now? l forgot the path l came. Minister begged me to run away. But l never listened to him. Oh my God! How big it is! Shaking its back! Practice well! You will get it right. Start now. Where is my arrow? l aimed at his head but the arrow struck his abdomen. Next. Where did this arrow go? Oh my God!- l missed it again. Why is the arrow going the other way? Worry not. Practice makes man perfect. Practice well. You must take revenge on the bearthat spat on you. Nothing wrong in losing 10 of our soldiers. Where did this go? Has it crossed the mountain? Minister...- My lord. Minister! Am l not worth enough to use bow and arrow? Nothing like that. Practice later. Okay. But will the bear come tonight? Let's do one thing. Let's hide in the underground jail. Minister, you're very clever. Now you know what sort of a King he is. A bear spat on him. He can't even shoot arrows properly. lf you talk great about him, l will kill you. Get lost. Rajaguru might find the truth if we make the slightest error. Only now we must be very careful with our moves. Mere moves aren't enough. We must be ready to fight. Keep the revolutionary army on red alert. -Yes my lord. Greetings. Did you call for me? Guru... Are you also a spy of the army which is against me? Don't you know about my family? We do not indulge in anything. We are mere spectators. Please believe me. - ldiot! Tell me the truth. As far as l know, a revolutionary army is ready to attack in our country. Who were you searching? l searched for no one. You are lying. You were looking for me, right? l'm not eligible forthat. Why do you say that? Everyone over here makes fun of me. Then how will you have a good opinion about me? The whip will caress a tiger when it is caged. By calling me a tiger, you're making me go wild. ls it because l found the tiger in you? You're very clever. -What do you mean by that? lt means that you're very clever. You're very shrewd. Come inside. He is there. He was bitten by a big rat. Come inside. lt is locked.- Don't worry. You are very slim. You can easily get through. Come that way. Give that to me. Now it is yourturn, my dear. Now you know how clever l am. This is foryou. Eat. You brought peanuts & flouryesterday. And today, you brought turtle gravy & rice flour. lf you weren't there, l might have grown thin. You cross so many hurdles and dangers for me. What if someone catches you? - No one can touch me. Even if the King comes here, l'll smash his face. Please don't say that. He is our King, right? So many are beating him to pulp. And now, you've joined their list too. My heart changed the first time l saw you. l hated food. l feel like walking in the air. Sometimes, whatever l say sounds like a song to me. l can't differentiate between sun & moon. l feel like my stomach has vanished. l feel like butterflies fluttering and hovering around my head. What are these symptoms? Signs of smallpox.- Really? You can't even understand one's love foryou. Sweetheart, do you love me? Soolayini, what do you see? Am l there with you? You're a sweet little fruit... You're my colourful parrot... You're a sweet little fruit... You're my colourful parrot... Let's romance on the bed... You're the King of sword fights & wars...

My lord, from Rajaguru's room... - Minister has come, right? Yes, my lord. He might've blabbered something. lt's alright. l'm prepared for everything. Greetings, my lord. Mr. Nixon has come to see you. Make sure Rajaguru doesn't know about Mr. Nixon arrival. Yes, my lord. Let's inform Rajaguru... To safeguard our interests. ls it?-Yes. He has given a very good idea. Why don't we kill him forthat? Very good idea. - My lord, please forgive me. Welcome Mr. Nixon. So, you're Mr. Nixon, ah? What happened to you Pulikesi? We meet quite often, don't we? - So what? The Pulikesi you met before is different from the Pulikesi you're meeting now. Your welcome is not proper. lt's not ourtradition to welcome scoundrels. You're talking too much. l'll talk even much more. Come to the point. l came to collect tax. - l won't pay. Reason? This is my country. And l'm the King. Then, why should l pay tax to the beggars who came here for a living? Beggars...? But you paid tax all these days. Yes, that's a mistake. lf you've any loyalty forthis country which gave you prosperity, return back the tax money which l had paid you till now. Arrogance?-Justice! Someone has poisoned your mind. Nobody can poison my mind since l'm the master of my will. Pulikesi, itching to wage a war? - l'm warning you. Okay. Forget it Pulikesi. We both lost cool in hot temper. When will you pay the tax? Now or later? Do you think l will dance to yourtunes? l will never ever pay tax to you. Even Kattabomman refuses to pay tax. Why won't you pay tax? How dare you ask me to pay tax? Why should we pay levy? What share do you have in our produce? When we sweated it out in ourfields, you were busy hunting animals in forest. When we watered our crops, you were busy taking sun bath... nude sun bath. When we had no waterfor our crops, you were busy drinking liquor in the Himalayas under woolen rugs. How dare of you ask us to pay tax at the time of harvest, you shameless beggars? Pulikesi, l had already told you. You need tax to run a government. Do you know anything about management rules? We gave to this world ''Arthasashtra'' and ''Thirukkural''. asking us about management, ah? The rules you know about management, tax & income. l too know the sub-sections of these. l know that tax is the backbone of any government. But the reason why l refuse to pay tax, is that why should we pay to those who came here for a living? Like me, if everyone refuses to pay tax, your empire will fall. after we chase you out of this country, we will correct the flaws in the system and will rule ourselves. So better leave this place. l'm leaving Pulikesi. But Collector 18th Edward is a very angry man. Tell him if he dares to steps into my kingdom, he'll get beheaded. You're going to face the tanks. Our women are running short of washing stones. Bring yourtanks. Arrogance...? Get out. Pulikesi...- Get out, you foreigner! Welcome...welcome... Welcome Mr. Nixon... Pulikesi... Who are you to decide not to pay tax to the British? Address me with formal respect. l'm the King. l'm the Rajaguru. Which means you are allowed to speak when l need any advice. So, you won't respect me, ah? Just because l respect you, l let the Englishman go. Or else l would've broken his teeth. You don't know about my true nature. Threatening me? What will you do? You're nothing when compared to my experience. Your experience is nothing when compared to my courage. You never saw my true nature. Only good men have another side known as bad. You can't have a good side, can you? You will die. Before that happens, l will destroy you. Have you dared to destroy me, right? Not only you, anyone who betrays my motherland will not be spared. We'll meet again. Certainly. By God's grace, our king has reformed. And he is ruling the country very well. What? Which King? Which King!? Our King Pulikesi. You're asking this as if you don't know. l heard that the King has gone an expedition. Before he does some good to this country, he won't go anywhere. Shut up & do your work. Forget about him. Our King spoke to Anaiappar regarding water, didn't he? lt was a great feat. Spoke to Anaiappar...? Why are getting surprised to everything? l'm eagerto know what all has happened. Our king spoke to Anaiappar. Stadium for communal clashes is closed. Converted harem into a school. Closed the soft drink factories of Akkamala & Gup-C. Robbers & thieves are rotting in underground jails. What else do you want to know, tell me? Who did all these? Our King 23rd Pulikesi. He is getting surprised again & again. Let me put this spear into his mouth. - Stop it, please. Please go. Mind your work. Leave him. Let's go. When l'm here...there.. The King is coming with Commander. Let's go there, quick. Every second we delay we get closerto danger. As planned, do what you are instructed to do. Got it? So, it is you who is helping him. Ruling the Kingdom in my disguise. You've made me fit for nothing. You'll die today. Welcome my lord. Please take your seat. Ukkiraputha...- Father. Agandamuthu told me that you're 23rd Pulikesi's twin brother. You look very much like your brother. My younger brother... The truth about you twins was nevertold to anyone. Sangilimayan sent you in the river. l was helpless. On one hand, my mother is not well. On the other hand, my brother Pulikesi has become a wastrel. Yes. That's why ljailed him knowing that he is my brother. To reform him. Poor boy Pulikesi. He is a good man. lt was time which paralyzed your mother. lt was your uncle's treachery which spoilt your brother. Sangilimayan was close to the British, hatched a plan to kill yourfather Mokkayappan, then Queen, your mother went to the battlefield leading the army on King's orders. She faced defeat. Because of the defeat, she was bed ridden for 12 years. Unable to move from her chair. Poor boy Pulikesi. He was only a child. He became a puppet in that demon's hands. Pulikesi is my brother. l must save him. Be careful Ukkiraputha. He doesn't know his own condition. You are right. Pulikesi... You don't need to lift your sword, Commander. l heard everything. Brother... l've a brother just like me. My brother is the King of this country. We are brothers. We both lost a chance of growing together. We haven't lost it. lf you realize your mistakes, we can be achieve more than what we had lost. How can that be possible? What do l have now to lose? Brother... lt's okay if this cuckoo was brought up in a crow's nest. lt was brought up in a eagle's nest. And it is now a slave to the eagle. Don't worry, my brother. Forget it. You've corrected everything. Why fear when you have a brother! O God! Thank you very much. l know that you both will unite. How? How...!? lt is easy to question me. What else can a screenplay writer think otherthan a re-union? What? l prepared your horoscopes. Only l knew that you both will unite in future. Brother, let's decide as to what has to be done. l've a message that Edward is coming tomorrow. Guards! Get my clothes. l'll unite revolutionaries and people against the oppressive Rajaguru. You go to the palace.- Okay. Mother... l'm ready to get punished for insulting you. l'll present you with a gift tomorrow morning. My lord...-Who is that? Greetings my lord. - Okay. What's the matter? A small doubt... There is nothing called small & big. Knock my door even at night. Tell me. So, it was this. For what & why? Yes Mr. Collector, what they said is right. Pulikesi has written a letter saying that he won't come back. Yes Mr. Collector. Everything happened in the blink of an eye. A coward. He planned but left the field midway. lt was you who wrote that, but blaming the King. Why? l'll tell you the reason. Bring him here. He is responsible for everything. He hatched a plan to capture the kingdom. So, he made Pulikesi his slave with his mesmerizing words. Their plan was to kill me. Join hands with Veerapandiya Kattabomman. And fight against you. l'm a black Cheetah. l've shattered all their plans. Tell me, what punishment does he deserve? ls there no one to save this great King 23rd Pulikesi? Oh my God! Hey you scoundrels! You've hit from behind and brought me here. You never saved rain water. But you've saved so much of water to kill a single man. Oh no! lt's very cold... Who is there? Wow! Light has come. He will help me to escape. My dear guard! Come fast... Please come and rescue your King. l can't, my King. l'm Rajaguru's man. Really? Rajaguru's man? lt's alright, guard. You're the one who used to fan me, aren't you? Don't you feel pity on your King? No King. One day, since l didn't fan you properly, you burnt my mouth with a hot rod. Did l do like that? My dear! l've forgotten it. You do one thing... Please release my hands... l'll fall at yourfeet and seek pardon. - l can't, my King. Guard, please listen to me... You used to pester me forfestival bonus, have you forgotten it? Your generous King is going to die now...- King... ls this how you show your loyalty to your King? Won't future history depict you as bad man? Think deeply... l'm coming, my King. Excellent, Pulikesi. You've won him with your oratory skills. You're a great administrator. Who has opened it? - lt's me, my King. ls it you? l've opened the hot water. Now you will feel warm. Hey, you fool, you scoundrel, you betrayer.... Phew! Talk less... All my plans fell flat. Do l need more practice? l wish you become the King. Thank you, Sir. l'll obey the order. Shoot him. Pulikesi? You said Pulikesi ran away, didn't you? How did he come here? Who gave you the right to punish him? Pulikesi, l'm not satisfied with your administration. Why? A revolutionary army is formed to fight against your bad administration. Uncle, l agree with you. But it's formed to destroy you first. Pulikesi, stop it. You've accepted that there is a revolutionary army. That's enough to remove your administration. Shut up! You scoundrel, who came here seeking livelihood. This is my palace. You're too late, Pulikesi. Warriors, come on... Oh God! Water level has reached my waist. ls there no other way to escape from here? Oh my God! What can l do now? - King... -Who is it? Oh my saviour! How did you come here? - l didn't come here voluntarily. My King, l'm here for arms scandal and they're punishing me severely. l had a hope that atleast you will help me. ls this my fate? Look how l'm suffering! -Very bad, my King.... l feel sorry that you're going to die with the chain which l made. What? Did you make this chain? -Yes, my lord. You stupid, couldn't you tell me this earlier? l was unaware of it till now. Who made this window? - l only, my King.- Thank god! Betrayers! You can't execute your plan. Even if you talk bravely, we won't spare you alive. Oh no! They are in trouble. Oh my brother! Don't get scared. Your brother Pulikesi is here. l'll rescue you. From now, l'm Ukkiraputhan. Wow! A horse is ready for me. l've to jump down to rescue our men. No fear... jump. Don't go away...no... Soldiers! Don't get scared of them. Come on... Greetings Rajaguru. Revolutionary army is outside the fort. Sir, excuse me. lt seems revolutionary army has come. Let's leave it to them. They will reveal the true colour of Pulikesi. Let the world know they deserve capital punishment. Call them. Welcome... Explain him clearly about the things happened. Two of you come here... Your name? My name is Ukkiraputhan. Tell me, what all did this king do? - He did many things. He hasn't cared about public, has he? - Never. He was an irresponsible King. He was always in harem, right? - Harem was everything to him. Not only that, he tortured his subjects very badly. You mean to say that he was a cruel King. You silly... Oh no! He is our King... Pulikesi?! Sir, he is Pulikesi's younger brother. They are twins. Danger... Where were you all these days? How did you both meet each other? All of you put down your guns. Or else your Edward's head will roll down. You fools! Are you planning to kill us in our place? l'll leave you. Run away...escape from here and lead a decent life. Get lost! Everyone here knows to fight. - Order me, my King. We are always ready forthe war. Are you ready to fight against us? You know, l'm 18th Edward. - So what? We're 23rd Pulikesi. Pulikesi, finally what do you say? Brother, just a minute... Get lost! Go and tell everyone that Pulikesi who got patted by a bear spat on you. Why did you reveal the bear spat matterto him? Why did you reveal it to him? Get out. All of you get out of this place. No Englishman should stay in my land. Get out. Minister... - Tell me. Where is Rajaguru? -Yes. He is missing... Since he had failed, he might've hidden somewhere. Okay then. First let's go and meet our mother. Come on... Come, my dear...come... Mother... Come my dear sons... Come near me... Oh my dearyounger son... No mother. l'm Pulikesi. He is the younger one. Mother, l'm your son, Ukkiraputhan. Don't cry, my dear son... Mother, don't cry. We got back ouryounger brother. My son Pulikesi... -Yes mother. Your highlight is your moustache. Why did you lose it? - That is a big story. Fate played havoc and our near ones shaved it off. Don't worry forthat. l've a duplicate of it. l'll come with that. Hey Pulikesi... Have you all united? This country belongs to me. People are my slaves. l'm the heartbeat of this kingdom. l never spare my enemies alive. Let's see... l'll fix the blade and come. Ukkiraputhan, get up... Get up... Hey Uncle... Take it and get lost! Brother, don't spare him alive. Shit! lt's my statue! Brother, please save me... Please save me... Brother... No...don't kill me... My dear son, don't kill him. lf you do so, then there won't be any difference between you both. Sangilimayan, you're my brother. Then how come you are heartless? Though you've done so many crimes against us, l always wished you'd reform. Brother, is it justified on your part? ls it not a betrayal to this country? lsn't it a great insult to our clan? Can our deaths get all that you desired? Tell me, my brother... l'm not asking this as King's mother. l'm asking this as your sister...tell me... Tell me, my brother... Long live, great King 23rd Pulikesi! Long live, great King Ukkiraputhan! Hail great King 23rd Pulikesi! Hail great King Ukkiraputhan! My dear children, you should live long. Stop, respected public. Don't be in a hurry... You always consider marriage as the curtains down for a show. First stop thinking like that. All of you take up your positions. Only now you're going to see an important event. My dear public, l was aimless and loitering around. My brother Ukkiraputhan had opened my vision of knowledge. You people are depending on me. To promote peace and love in our country, l've formulated 10 new commands. 1. Education to all. will be severely punished. Those who do it will be sent to jail. Those who do so will be caned. So, those who can't speak or write in mother tongue won't get theirfamily cards. 7. Only there are 2 castes. Males and Females. it will be capital punishment. . Everyone should pay taxes. Evaders will be punished. 10. Corruption is worse than famine. Punishment for it is public humiliation. lf you all strictly follow these 10 commandments, Peace and Prosperity will sustain in this country. We need not have to fear to fight British. Alexander, Emperor Ashoka, Mel Gibson of Braveheart will be our role models. Go home happily. Thank you.
