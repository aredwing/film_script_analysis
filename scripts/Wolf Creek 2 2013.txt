Faster than I was supposed to, if you blokes pulled me up. You shoot pigs for a living? Bet your life. Can you read? Well, get a bit stuck on the big words every now and then, but you know. Yeah, I can read pretty good. Then you'd be able to read the sign back there with the big one-fuckin'-double-zero on it, wouldn't you? You know, I could've sworn I was, you know, sittin' under 100 there. You know. You think I'm talking shit? Struth no. No, sorry, mate. No. No, look, won't happen again, all right? Where the fuck you think you're going? You bastards. You're putting me on, aren't you? You're not really going to book me, are you? Can I see your license, please? You're a long way from home, aren't ya? Look, always travel up north when I'm doing a bit of hunting, you know. Get away from it all. Not a lot of pigs down south. Ooh! This, plus a speeding ticket. It's an order to take this car off the road for good. Tires are as bald as a baby's ass. Amazed it's even running. Body looks like you've thrown it off a fuckin' cliff! Aw... Come on. Now you take this piece of shit back to town, and then you get the fuck back where you came from. I don't want to see your ugly mug around here ever again. You understand? Or is that too many big words for you? Mate, you sure you want to give me this? Bet your life. You have a nice day. Ta! You fuckin' asshole. Oh, man. That's how we keep our quotas up out here, son. Oh, man. "You sure you want to give me this?" Yeah. Pretty sure you just got that rusted piece of shit taken off the road, too. Fuckin' dickhead. Oh, man, did you see the look on his face? What a redneck moron. Jesus! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, the... Fuck! Shot! Where the bloody hell do you think you're going? You're crazy, mate! Not me leg. I think it's broken. Yeah. Ah, shut up, you big crybaby. That'll do, pig. What do you think you're fuckin' doing? You know, your little mate's right. I am a pig shooter. You know what I do to pigs who won't stop squealing? I make 'em stop! Fuck me. You stupid pair of bastards. Look at the fuckin' mess you made, huh? Now, I gotta clean it up. They'll fuckin' find us! They'll find the fuckin' car and then they'll... Fuck. I want to see my kids. Why? Mate... Mate, wait. I can make the ticket go away, mate. Or I can make you go away. Let's go! You are seriously a hero. Hello. Cool. Hey! Thank you! Thank you! Have a good trip. Awesome. They are so cute. I love them. What are they called again? The little black one's called Nutella. Yeah, we have that in Europe, too. I know it's brown, but it's my little daughter's idea of a joke. And the little one with the broken horn is called Casper. And, uh, the other one, that's Marley. - Okay. - Thank you so much. - It's all right. - Here we are. Bye-bye, kids. - Thank you. Auf Wiedersehen. - See ya. Okay. - See ya, love. - Thank you very much. So cool. Oops. Hello, and, uh, goodbye. All right, if you keep fighting you're gonna go back to the car. Motherfucker! What's wrong with you people? You afraid to stop or something? Yahtzee. What the bloody hell are you buggers doing out here? This is a national park. You can't camp here, mate. Uh... Sorry, we did not know that was the case. About national parks, I mean. No signs here. Oh, well, don't get your knickers in a knot, mate, I'm not a ranger or anything. Eh? Look at this bloody fire, mate. You haven't put it out properly. All this bloody saltbush around here is dry as a nun's nasty. You know, one spark, the whole bloody place will go up! Ah. I... I did put some water on it. Yeah? Well, for all the good you've done, you may as well have pissed on it, eh? It was a good thing I found you, huh? Name's Mick. Rutger. Rutger. Rutger! Eh? Kraut, are ya? I'm, um... From Germany. They usually are. Okay. Oh... Heil, Frulein. Hi. Little bit of German for you. It's good, Frulein. As I was saying, mate, if the rangers did find you, you'd be charged, right? You wouldn't want that, would you? No. As a matter of fact, mate, I'm going back through town, so I can give you a lift, okay? You know, and set you up in a caravan park for the night. Right? Yeah? You wouldn't want to be hiking back into town, would you? No, we were hoping to get lift tomorrow. Like I said, there's no signs here, so did not think we were doing anything wrong. Well, I'm offering you a lift, mate, you know. So you won't get caught. Um... Are you sure there's no camping here? I checked on the map. I just said so, didn't I? Well, yes, but... Well, you calling me a liar? Um... Look, I'm gonna give you one last chance to help you out. All right? Thank you, but, um, we will stay. Sorry about the fire and for making you come out of your way. Don't you turn your back on me, you Nazi bastard! So, let me hear you talk back now, you dopey cunt. Rutger! Rutger! Rutger! Rutger! Let me go! Let me go! Eh? Keep still. Keep still. Keep fucking still! Now put your hands together. Put your fucking hands together, or I'll spread your nose all over your face. Huh? Now look, I didn't want to do you here, but your stupid fucking boyfriend forced me. And now, why wait, eh? Anyways, my name's Mick Taylor. Pleased to meet you. You know... I still don't know what you friggin' tourists see in this place. I mean, is this the way you spend your life, Frulein? Eh? Coming out here and shitting in our backyard? Is that what it's all about, eh? Is it, eh? I'm talking to you. Talking to you! Oh... Oh, look at that, eh? Cookies! Rutger! Rutger! Rutger, no! Eh? Shit! He's tougher than a pig. Where you crawling off to, Frulein? Now, I promise you. We're gonna spend a nice, long, few months together. There we go! Non-smoker. Gutless Kraut now, huh? Jesus! Rutger, what are you, part bloody donkey? Who's the lucky girl, then? That'd make your eyes water, wouldn't it? Here's a little piggy, here's his snout. Slit him open and his guts fail out. Get your fucking head out of there. All good. The dogs'll like that. Oh, you mongrel bastard. Oh, Jesus. Come on! Come on. Quickest way to a man's heart is through his chest, eh? Doesn't look fucking easy getting through that fucking breastplate, does it? Can you fucking believe it? There we are. Oh, no. Rip your heart out. There we go! Hide and seek, is it? Hey, come on, girly. Up the ass. Wait, wait. You have to run faster than that. Clever bitch, eh? Beck? Becky? Hello, Angel? I can't hear you, babe. Um... Becky. Bollocks. Holy shit! Help me! Hey, hey, hey, hey! What happened? Did you get hit? What? It's all right. Come on! We're gonna get you out of here, all right? All right. Whoa. Hey, is there anyone else? Is there anyone... Who did this shit to you? Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on! Give me your hand, all right? I don't understand you! Who's this fucking maggot? Who was that? Who was that? What the fuck is going on here? You'll have to do better than that, asshole! Oh, shit! It's all right! Hey, little pigs, little pigs! Let me come in! It's all right! Come on, you fucker! Whoa! Fuck! Fuck! Hold on! Oh, God! It's all right. Hang on. It's all right. See you in hell, cunt! Jesus. Yeah! Oh, shit! Are you all right? Oh, shit! Fuck! For fuck's sake, Mick! Don't! Fuck! I'm... I'm sorry. Shit! Shit, shit, shit! Uh... Hey! Oh, shit! What the fuck's wrong with you, you pricks? Stop, you fucking bastards! Okay. Okay. Hey! Hey! Stop! Here! Hey! Oh, fuck me. Oh, shit! Thanks for the truck, blubber guts. Let's play, eh? Come on! Oh, shit! Whoops. Bit of music, eh? Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Hey! Shit! Flying kangaroo! Oh! Sorry, Skippy. Hey! Welcome to Australia, cocksucker. Come on. Oh! Come on! Shit! You'll have to do better than that! He's got to be hungry, I know that. We didn't know whether to wake you. We're heading to town as soon as you've eaten something. Phone? No phones. We got shortwave if it was working. It's the magnets. Something weird in the ground. Even the TV goes on the blink now and again. Ah, you got to be self-sufficient out here. It's all right. You're safe now. I'm Lil. This is Jack. Paul. Come on, son. Eat up. You'll need your strength. I made it special for you. You in there, hero? You don't want anyone else to get hurt, do you, eh? He's here. Don't you worry, mate. I'll see to it. Get off my property. Hey, mate. The boy. Hand him over. I said get the hell away from here. Now get. He's gone. No. No, he's... He's not. He will be if I see him again. The car's at the front. We'll all go out together. You got the keys, no? I can't. Shit. Hey, baby. We could have had a good time, you and me. Please! Just leave me alone. Fucking Pommy, eh? I... - Huh. Definitely a Pommy. - Weak as piss. Obviously don't know the first rule of the Outback, hero. You never, ever stop. Could have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble. Why you here, Pommy? Please... I asked you a question. - Why are you here? - Please... Please... I didn't... I didn't mean to interfere. I should have just left her there and minded my own business. Well, maybe I can answer it for you, huh? You're here for an adventure. You're here for a bit of excitement, hmm? - For the thrill, hey? Hey? - Yes. Yes! Yes! - Something a bit different! - Please. Please! Just let me out of here. And I'll just walk away. That's a good one. You expect to come to my fucking country, waltz around like you own the bloody place, come between a man and his meal and "just walk away," eh? Just like that? Please! Don't! You owe me, boy. What made you think you could just take her away from me, huh? Just wanted to... Hey? Hey, hey, hey? Where's your famous English wit, now? Huh? Even harder to be a smartass with no fucking tongue. There once was a lad from York, who picked his nose with a fork. And when it got stuck, he cried, "I don't give a fuck," and walked around looking like a dork. There once was a man, uh, from Kansas, whose nuts were made of brass. In stormy weather, he'd clack them together, and lightning would shoot out his ass. What are you doing, Pom? Hmm? There once was an old lady from Wheeling, who had a peculiar feeling. And she lied on her back, and tickled her crack, and pissed all over the ceiling. "Pissed all over the ceiling." You're a funny little fuck, aren't ya, eh? English wit, mate. Where'd you learn those? Boarding school. Boarding school, huh? Pants-down, botty-whackers, eh? Only on weekends. You still know fuck all about my country, eh, you little Pommy ponce? There once was an Australian stockman, lying, dying. And he got up on one elbow and he turned to his mates who had all gathered around and he said... Watch me Wallabies feed, mate Watch me Wallabies feed They're a dangerous breed, mate So watch me Wallabies feed All together now!

Tan me hide when I'm dead, Fred Tan me hide when I'm dead So we tanned his hide when he died, Clyde And that's it hanging on the shed! Hey! Fuck me. You mad little British bastard. Well, you know... Where do you know that song from? Uh... My mother had the record. - Oh. - We'd listen to it endlessly as kids. My word, eh? You are a knowledgeable little prick, eh? I'll tell you what, mate. Let's have a fucking drink, eh? I thought you'd never fucking ask, mate. "I thought you'd never fucking ask." Tie me kangaroo down, sport Tie me kangaroo down There you are, son. Let's wrap the laughing gear around this one, eh? Oh. Thanks. It'd be better to have a free hand. Oh. Thanks for mentioning that. I would never have thought. You know. There we go. - Thank you. - Okay. - Get that up, son. - Thank you. Please. Here's looking up ya bum. Whoo... All right, isn't it? Tastes like camel's piss but, Jesus, it gives a man a fuckin' buzz. Rum. It's all me and my mates used to drink back home. Yeah? Rum, eh? Here's a good one. My name is old Jack Palmer I once dug for gold The song I'm 'bout to sing ya Recalls the days of old When I'd plenty mates around me and the mates would fairly hum As we all sat together round the old keg of rum The old keg of rum, the old keg of rum As we all sat together round the old keg of rum The old keg of rum... Australians all, let us rejoice For we are young and free With golden soil and wealth for toil Our home is girt by sea I hate that fucking song. "Girt by sea." Who's "Gert"? Some fucking big butch lesbian standing astride Sydney fucking heads or something. It's a fucking shit song. Hmm... Oh, shit. Now, seeing as you're such an amusing fucking Einstein know-it-all bastard, I got this little game we can play, huh? - Kind of like a quiz. Yeah. - Right. I call it Aussie history. I ask you 10 questions, you get half of 'em right, so, five, and then I'll let you go. Does that sound all right to you? That's... That sounds fucking brilliant. Really? Sorry. I didn't get your name, mate. Ah. Mick Taylor's the name. Pig-shooter and general fuckin' Outback legend. Right. Cheers. - You ready to rock 'n' roll? - Yeah. What's that for, Mick? Oh, I forgot to mention. For each one that you get wrong, I get to grind off a finger. So, 10 questions, 10 fingers. Kind of fitting, you know what I mean? Of course. So it's sort of like Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? Yeah! Except you don't get to phone a friend if you get one wrong because you'll be too busy screaming in fucking agony. All right. Let's rock 'n' roll then. All right. We'll start off with an easy one. What Aboriginal term meaning "waterhole" is also the name of an Australian surf clothing company? Billabong. Very good. - Next one's a bit harder. - Right. But you're a stinkin' Pom, so you'll be all right. In what year did the British settle in Australia? Oh, um... After Lieutenant James Cook discovered the east coast and mapped it in 1770, the First Fleet arrived and settled on 26th of January, 1788. Does that answer your question? Jesus! You are a smart cunt. I might have to let you go on that answer alone. Where'd you learn all that shit? I'm majoring in history. Majoring in history? That's a fucking coincidence, isn't it, eh? But I am a man of my word, and either way, you know, I did say 10... Here we go. Okay. Mmm. Rightio. In what year did the British start deporting convicts to Australia? The first 11 ships of the First Fleet arrived with their cargo of around 780 British convicts in Botany Bay, New South Wales. And a further two convict fleets arrived in 1790 and 1791. The first free settlers arrived in 1793. Mick? Mick? That's right. Isn't it? I know it is. Why? Um... I'm not really sure I understand the question. Why did the British deport convicts to Australia? Why? Um... Uh... Come on, you dumb fuck. Time waits for no man. - No, no, no! - Tick, took, tick, took, tick... First, first... First of all, after the British lost the 13 colonies they'd lost their penal settlements in Virginia, in the United States. And they needed somewhere to put all the criminals that were stacking up in England. There were... There were just too many of these people, and they were just spreading disease and wasting resources. And, second of all, they... And just, Australia looked to be as rich in resources as the Americas. And obviously the British wanted to settle this before the French did. Or the Dutch. Something like that? Mick, no. What the fuck, man? That's right! What are you doing? Mick! Fuck! That's the right fucking answer! What do you want me to fucking... Fuck! Mick, that's right! Fuck! That's the right fucking answer, Mick! Mick! Jesus Christ! No! I got two. Come on! You don't need to fucking do this! I got them all right. It's the right fucking answer! It was fucking right! - No, it wasn't. - Yes, it was the right fucking... No, it wasn't. The right answer is because they are a pack of Pommy cunts. No, seriously, you're right, you know, technically. And that gives me the shits. Come on. Calm down. Calm down. Jesus Christ, you're going on like a big girl. It fucking hurt. Knock those tears off. Knock 'em off, you bloody suck. - You all right? - Yeah. Jesus H. Christ, boy. You all right? You all right? Yeah. Right? All right? All right. Just one more quick one. An easy one and then I'll get us another drink. And you can be on your way. Eh? You're doing real well, mate. You're doing real well. Cheers. Now, who's Australia's most famous cricketer? And not Shane fucking Warne. Come on. Come on. I don't know anything about fucking cricket. Can you ask me a football question? You don't have to know about cricket to know who this bloke is. Just give me a clue. Well, he's the greatest cricketer of all time. The Muhammad Ali of fucking cricket! Oh, shit. Come on, Paul. It's on the tip of my fucking tongue! Yeah, well, look. This will be on the tip of your bloody tongue in a minute! What kind of a bloody idiot you take me for? What letter does it fucking start with? "D." D... D... D... - Douglas Jardine. - Fucking Pommy, you idiot. Dennis... Dennis Lillee. Not fucking Dennis Lillee. - It's Dennis fucking Lillee. - It's not Dennis Lillee. A famous cricketer that starts with "D." It's not fucking Dennis fucking Lillee. What the fuck is it then if it's not... Fuck this! Fuck you! No, no, no! Please! Please! Jesus Christ, the other hand! - Eh? - Use the fucking other hand, Mick! Is that your wanking hand, is it? Please yourself. Mick, it's Dennis fucking Lillee! Dennis fucking Lillee! Please! Please! Please! Mick! Mick! Mick! It's Dennis Lillee... Give me that fucking hand or I'll knock your fucking teeth right down your fucking throat. You understand me? Eh? Eh? Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh, no! Please. Just let me out of here. Of course I am going to let you out of there, mate. You've been a real good sport. But first I'm going to grab us another drink. All right? You're going to let me go now? Yeah, of course I will. Yeah, I'm going to let you out of here and then I'm going to take you somewhere else. - Down there. - No! 'Cause you see, no one really gets out of here. Well, not in one piece, you know. Figuratively speaking. That would just be crazy. What the fuck is this? You said you were a man of your word. I am. I am, mate. As I said, you owe me, boy. You took away my plaything. And so, you're just going to have to stand in for a bit. Okey dokey? No. You're some fucking faggot freak. You... Don't you ever fucking say that! Don't you ever say that! Hey! This will turn you into a woman. I didn't mean it like that. Hey, Mick. It's Don Bradman, bitch. You'll have to do better than that, you Pommy cunt! Oi! That really bloody hurt! I think you cracked me skull! I got claret coming out of me bloody skull, all over the place! There's blood everywhere! I hope you're happy with yourself, mate! Yeah, I reckon by now you ought to have found the dead end. People have been dying to get out of here. Fuck! Oh, Danny boy The pipes, the pipes are calling From glen to glen And down the mountain side The summer's gone and all the flowers are dying You've got to be fucking joking. Here comes Uncle Mick! Make it stop! Please! Please, don't leave me! I'll come back! I'll come back! Please! Help me! Now, about all them bodies. They deserved it. All of 'em. Foreign bastards! Noxious, bloody weak. Somebody's gotta keep Australia beautiful! Fuck! We're having such a good time. Singing, and drinking, and carrying on. Tie me kangaroo down, sport Tie me kangaroo down Tie me... Ah, fuck ya! Come on! Come on! Get out of here! Get him! Go on, get away up there. Get on him! No! Come on, mate. Where do you think you're going? I told ya, there's no way out of here. Fee-fi-fo-fum I smell the blood of a stinkin' Porn! Bit rough, ain't it? Now, where were we? Yeah, that's right. You see, in this world, there's people like me and there's people like you. And people like me eat people like you for breakfast and shit 'em out. You're nothing but foreign vermin. A stinking introduced species. And it's up to my kind to wipe your kind out. And that makes me the winner. Which makes you... You got to help me. You got to help me.
