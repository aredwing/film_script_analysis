I can't tell you where I heard it, but I heard things ain't going so good for your kinfolk... Down on Earth. There's trouble? - Is it Julie? - Well, I don't know exactly. - Well, is it my boy? - I told you I don't know. Well, now, ain't that just dandy? Here you take the trouble to tell me there's trouble down there, but you don't know what kind of trouble it is. Do me a favor, will you? Go... Bother somebody else while I finish these... ...stars. - All right. I just thought you might want to go down there, maybe help. Who, me? You gone loony or something? How? Well, everybody's got a right to go back for one day. - They have? - Sure. That's the only reason I told you. Hey, come here. Come here. Hey. Not that I'm interested in going back there, but, uh, just in case I should be, who, uh... Who gives out this permission? The star keeper. Him, huh? Well, I'll think about it. Was you wanted to see me? Yes, I was. I heard my family's in trouble down there. Somebody tried to tell me if I came up here and see you, why... You'd give me permission to go back for one day. - Is that a fact? - Yes. But as I recall, Bigelow, when you first got here, you waived that right. - I did? - Yep, pretty sure, but let's look at the record. Ah, here we are. "Bigelow. Question, "'Is there anything on Earth you left unfinished, Mr. Bigelow? "The reason I ask is you're entitled to go back there for one day if you want to. ' "Answer, 'As long as I'm here, I might as well stay. "' I said that? Why, you don't think this book's incorrect, do you? No. Well, if that's the way it is, that's the way it is. Wait a minute, now. Wait a minute. You know, sometimes we make exceptions in special cases. Special cases? Oh, you mean, if a guy led a good life, he'd deserve a break? - That kind of thing, huh? - Mm-hmm. - I know the answer already. - Do you, now? Now, how do you know how we judge things up here? Eh, it'd just be wasting your time and mine. Simmer down now, Billy. You're forgetting. Here there is no time. This is the beginning and the end. Why don't you tell me about yourself? What did you do down there? What did I do down there? Oh, you mean, "What did I do for a living?" Well, you can start there, if you want. Well, uh... - I owned this carousel. - You what? Look. If you know this story, what do you want to hear it again for? Oh, I don't know the story, but I can see through you like a pane of window glass. Now, why don't you start over? Well, I worked for this lady who owned the carousel. Ah. But I was the main attraction. I was, wasn't I? Every night, girls would gather around, music would be playing, the carousel would be going round and round, the whole midway would be packed with people, and I'd be standing up there. All right, everybody. Hurry, hurry. Come ride on the carousel. One more glorious spin. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Step right this way, and come ride the... The ride starts in a few minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Just a very few minutes. Hurry, hurry over this way and... - - Do you mind? Come on, everybody. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Ride on the carousel, the most beautiful carousel you've ever seen. And this year it's faster and faster. The ride of a lifetime. Fifteen minutes for five cents is all, five little cents. Get in line. Young lady, where's your ticket? - I don't have any. - You can buy one. Up. Julie. Julie, come on. Hurry. Come on. She's coming after us again. Let's run. No, I ain't scared of her. Listen, you little... I've got one more thing to tell you. If you ever so much as poke your nose in my carousel again, I'm gonna have you thrown out, right on your little pink bustle. You've got no call to talk to her like that. She ain't doing you no harm. Oh, ain't she? I suppose you think I wanna get in trouble with the police - and maybe lose my license? - What is the woman talking about? Letting my barker fool with you. Ain't you ashamed? - I don't let no man fool... - He leaned against her all through the ride. He leaned against the horse, but he didn't lay a hand on me. Oh, no, Miss Innocence. And I suppose he didn't put his arm around your waist neither. And suppose he did. Is that a reason to go and have a "capuleptic" fit? You mind your own business, you hussy. Go on back to your old carousel and leave us alone. - Yeah, leave us alone, you old... - I don't run my business for a lot of sluts. Who you calling a slut? Slut yourself. - Yeah, slut yourself. - Shut up! Jabber, jabber, jabber, jabber, jabber. What's going on anyway? Spitting and sputtering like three lumps of corn a-poppin' on a shovel. - Mr. Bigelow, please... - Don't yell. - I didn't yell. - Well, don't. What's the matter? I want you to take a good look at that girl, Billy. She ain't never to be allowed on my carousel again. Next time she tries to get in, if she dares, I want you to throw her out, you understand? - Throw her out! - All right, all right. Well, you heard what the lady said. Go on. Go on home. - Shoo, get. - Come on, Julie. - No, I won't. - Would you like a nice, cool drink, Billy? - Sure. - Mr. Bigelow. Tell me, please, honest and truly. If I come back to the carousel again, would you throw me out? What did she do anyway? She said you put your arm around my waist. Aha, well. There's something new. Can't put my arm around a girl without first asking permission, is that how it is? No, I just don't want that one around no more. You come around all you like, see. You ain't got the price, Billy Bigelow will treat you to a ride. Big talker, ain't you, Mr. Bigelow? I suppose you think I can't throw you out too if I want to? You're such a good barker, I can't run my business without you, is that it? Well, just for that, you're discharged. Your services are no longer required. You're bounced. See? Very well, Mrs. Mullin. Very well. Well, now, you know, I could bounce you if I felt like it. Well, you felt like it just now. So I'm bounced, bounced. Well, now, you don't have to pick up every word I say. I only said that I... Said that my services were no longer required. Very good, Mrs. Mullin. We'll let it go at that. All right, you devil. We'll let it go at that. - Mr. Bigelow, if she said she's... - You keep out of this. But I don't want this to happen on account of me. - Apologize to her. - Aha! Me apologize to her? For what? For giving my carousel a bad name? A ba... The day you bought the carousel, Mrs. Mullin, it got a bad name. After all I've done for you, that's what... - Now I am through with you. - Go on. - And it's for good, do you hear? - Go on. Get! Through for good. And I won't take you back like I done before. What will you do now, Mr. Bigelow? Well, first of all, I'll go get myself a glass of beer. Whenever anything bothers me, I always drink a glass of beer. Then you are bothered about losing your job. No, only about how I'm gonna pay for the beer. Will you pay for it? You? - How much money you got? - Forty-three cents. And you? I asked you how much money you got? Oh. You don't need to cry about it. If you ain't got it, you ain't got it. Tell her to stop crying. Carrie. Well, that's better. I'm going over to the carousel and get my things. Hey, you know that bench down the road? The one by the... By the water, the last one, by the tree. I'll meet you there. And then we'll go see about having that drink. It's all right. Keep your money. This time, I'll pay. Julie. Huh? I've been bustin' to tell you something lately. You have? The reason I didn't care to tell you before was... Well, 'cause you didn't have a fella of your own. But now that you got one, I can tell you about mine. I'm glad you've got a fella, Carrie. What's his name? His name is Mister Snow And an upstanding man is he He comes home every night in his round bottomed boat With a net full of herring from the sea An almost perfect beau As refined as a girl could wish But he spends so much time in his round bottomed boat That he can't seem to lose the smell of fish! The last time he kissed me the whiff of his clothes Knocked me flat on the floor of the room But now that I love him my heart's in my nose And fish is my favorite perfume! Last night he spoke quite low And a fair spoken man is he And he said "Miss Pipperidge, I'd like it fine "If I could be wed with a wife "And indeed, Miss Pipperidge If you'll be mine "I'll be yours for the rest of my life!" Next moment we were promised And now my mind's in a maze For all it ken do is look forward to That wonderful day of days When I marry Mister Snow The flowers'll be buzzin' with the hum of bees The birds'll make a racket in the church yard trees When I marry Mister Snow Then it's off to home we'll go And both of us'll look little dreamy-eyed A drivin' to a cottage by the Oceanside Where the salty breezes blow He'll carry me 'cross the threshold And I'll be as meek as a lamb Then he'll set me on my feet And I'll say, kinda sweet Well, Mister Snow here I am! Then I'll kiss him so he'll know That everythin'll be as right as right ken be A livin' in a cottage by the sea with me For I love that Mister Snow That young, seafarin' bold and darin' Big, be-whiskered over-bearin Darlin' Mister Snow - Carrie, I'm so happy for you. - Yeah. Come on. I don't wanna be late. Carrie, this is where he meant us to wait. - You sure? - Yes. - It's awful quiet here, Julie. - Yes, it is. Hardly anyone ever goes past here. Do you think the stories about him are true? Probably. Well... What are you girls doing here? You told us to wait for you. I meant she was to wait. You can go home. Why, Mr. Bigelow. If you think either one of us would stay here with you alo... Oh, Mr. Bigelow, it's late. If Julie stays, she'll lose her job. Lose your job 'cause you stay out late? Where do you work? At Bascombe's Cotton Mill. All Bascombe's girls have to be respectable. We all have to live in the mill boarding house and if we're late, they lock us out and we can't go back to work there anymore. Is that right? They bounce you if you ain't home on time? - That's right. - It's late, Julie. We ought to go. Are you coming? Should I go, Julie? I can't tell you what to do, Carrie. All right. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Good-bye, Julie. Good-bye, Carrie. Well, now we're both out of jobs. - You had your supper? - No. You want to eat out on the pier? No. You don't come around the carousel very much, do you? I only seen you two or three times before today. I've been there much more than that. Is that right? - Did you see me? - Yes. Did you know I was Billy Bigelow? The girls told me. - You got a sweetheart? - No. - Now, don't lie to me. - I haven't any. Why, you stayed here the first time I asked you to. You wouldn't have stayed so quick if you hadn't done it before. What did you stay for anyway? So you wouldn't be left alone. Holy smokes, you're dumb. I don't need to be alone. I can have all the girls I want. Don't you know that? I know, Mr. Bigelow. All the girls are crazy for you. Well, that's more like it. You know what you remind me of? A girl I knew at Coney Island. Tell you how I met her. We was just putting out the lights one night when... Is that you, Miss Jordan? Yes, Mr. Bascombe. - Whatever are you doing out at this hour? - Well, I... You couldn't be home in time now if you ran all the way. No, sir. And what's it your business? Mr. Bigelow, this is Mr. Bascombe. He owns the mill. I don't care what he owns. If you ask me, he owns a lot of nerve. What right's he got coming here... What's going on here? - Oh, good evening, Timmany. - Evening, Mr. Bascombe. - Are you having trouble? - Well... Him having trouble? Ask me. I was just setting here with my lady friend not bothering nobody. And old sideburns here... Hear now, Bigelow. Don't be calling Mr. Bascombe names unless you're fixing to get yourself in trouble. - You know this fellow, Timmany? - Yes, Mr. Bascombe. We have a report on him from the chief of police of Bangor. He's a pretty fly gazabo. Works on carousels. Makes a specialty out of pretty young ones like this. Gets 'em all moony eyed, promises to marry 'em then takes their money. I haven't got any money. - That's right. She ain't. - Oh, you found that out already. Julie, you are a young and inexperienced child. And I've decided to give you one more chance. I'll take you back to the house myself and explain everything to the matron. Come, my child. Well, don't stand there like you didn't have good sense. Do I have to go with you? Well, no, you don't have to. - Then I'll stay. - After I warned you. You see, Timmany? There are some you just can't help. - Good night. - Good night, Mr. Bascombe. You. I ought to throw you in jail. - What for? - Don't know. Wish I did. Well, and then what? Huh? You were telling me a story. You were just putting out the lights when... Oh, yeah. Well, just as the lights went out, someone come along. It was this little girl, the one with the... Tell me something. Ain't you scared of me? I mean, after what that cop said about me taking money from girls. I ain't scared. You're a funny kid. Well, you wanna go into town and dance? Oh, no. I have to be careful. - Of what? - My character. See, I'm never gonna marry. Huh? Well, a girl who don't marry has gotta be much more particular. About what? Who she's seen with? Oh, no. No. About not letting other people get the wrong impression. See, if... If I was gonna marry, it wouldn't make so much difference. Oh. Suppose I was to say to you that I'd marry you. You? That scares you, don't it? You're thinking about what that cop said. No. Why, I never paid no mind to what he said. Well, you wouldn't marry a fella like me anyway, would you? Yes, I would... If I loved you. Why, it wouldn't make any difference what you... Even if I died for it. Nah. How do you know what you'd do if you loved me, how you'd feel or anything? I don't know how I'd know. But I know how it would be... If I loved you. But you don't. No, I don't. But somehow I ken see Jest exactly how I'd be If I loved you Time and again I would try to say All I'd want you to know If I loved you Words wouldn't come in an easy way Round in circles I go! Longin' to tell you But afraid and shy I let my golden chances Pass me by! Soon you'd leave me Off you would go in the mist of day Never, never To know How I loved you If I loved you! Well, anyway, you don't love me. That's what you said, wasn't it? Yes. I can smell them. Can you? The blossoms. The wind brings them down. There ain't much wind tonight. Hardly any. You can't hear a sound Not the turn of a leaf Nor the fall of a wave hittin' the sand The tide's creepin' up on the beach like a thief Afraid to be caught stealin' the land On a night like this I start to wonder What life Is all about And I always say two heads are better than one To figger it out I don't need you or anyone to help me. I've got it figured out for myself. What are we? Just a couple of specks of nothing. Look up there. Why you can't even count the stars in the sky And the sky's so big the sea looks small And two little people you and I We don't count at all You're a funny kid. I don't remember ever meeting a girl like you. Hey, you trying to get me to marry you? - No. - Well, then what's putting it into my head? - I wonder what it would be like. - If you loved me? But you don't. No, I don't. But somehow I can see Just exactly how I'd be If I loved you Time and again I would try to say All I'd want you To know If I loved you Words wouldn't come in an easy way Round in circles I'd go! Longin' to tell you But afraid and shy I'd let my golden chances Pass me by! Soon you'd leave me Off you would go in the mist of day Never, never To know How I loved you If I loved you! Well, anyway, I... I ain't the kind of a fella to marry anybody. Even if a girl was foolish enough to want me to, I wouldn't. Don't worry about it, Billy. Who's worried? You're right about there being no wind. The blossoms are just coming down by theirselves. It's just their time to, I reckon. Well, you being Julie's only kinfolk, I thought you'd want to know. Ain't seen that barker from the carousel neither. He got bounced too. - If you ain't got any better than them... - Oh, I got better. I got better. It could be accidental, them both disappearing at the same time. All the same, it does look a might peculiar. Nobody in our family ever did anything to be ashamed of, Clem Hoops. Now, you just find me a couple of good, big lobsters or get! Cousin Nettie! Julie, Julie. Julie. Oh, I'm so glad to see you. - I was wondering where you been. - I been getting married, Cousin Nettie. This is my husband, Billy Bigelow. - Your husband? - It's a fact, Nettie. Look. - It's pretty. - Solid gold plated. I'm pleased to know you, Mr. Bigelow. And I wish you both all the happiness in the world. I'd have said it sooner, but it's kind of a surprise. It takes a little getting used to. Me, I never got used to it. I just couldn't get the hang of being married. Was that Julie's fault? I didn't say that. But maybe it wasn't my fault either. There was only one carousel in town. I couldn't go back there. - I didn't have a job. - What did you live on? Her cousin Nettie. - To be perfectly honest with you, I tried... - I would be if I were you. All right. I didn't mind living off her cousin Nettie. It was... It was just having nothing to do that drove me crazy. Well, a couple of months went by. Then it was June. Everybody was getting ready for the first clambake of the season. Excepting Julie and me, everybody was having themselves a whale of a time. June is bustin' out all over! All over the meadow and the hill! Buds're bustin' outa bushes And the rompin' river pushes Every little wheel that wheels beside a mill June is bustin' out all over The ocean is full of Jacks and Jills! With her little tail a-swishin' Every lady fish is wishin' That a male would come and grab her by the gills! Because it's June! June, June, June Jest because it's June June June Fresh and alive and gay and young June is a love song sweetly sung June is bustin' out all over! The sapplin's are bustin' out with sap! Love has found my brother, Junior And my sister's even loonier! And my Ma is gettin' kittenish with Pap! June is bustin' out all over! The sheep aren't sleepin' any more All the rams that chase the ewe sheep Are determined there'll be new sheep And the ewe sheep aren't even keepin' score! Because it's June June, June, June Just because it's June, June June It's June, June, June Just because it's June, June March went out like a lion A whippin' up the water in the bay Then April cried and stepped aside And along come pretty little May! May was full of promises But she didn't keep 'em quick enough for some And a crowd of Doubtin' Thomases Was predictin' that the summer'd never come! But it's comin', by gum! Y'ken feel it come! Y'ken feel it in your heart Y'ken see it in the ground! Y'ken hear it in the trees Y'ken smell it in the breeze Look around, look around Look around! June is bustin' out all over To ladies the men are payin' court Lots a ships are kept at anchor Jest because the Captains hanker for the comforts they can only get in port! - You can feel it comin' - June is bustin' out all over The moonlight is shinin' on the shore And the girls who were contrary with the boys in January Aren't nearly so contrary anymore! - Because it's June - June, June, June Just because it's June, June, June Because it's June June, June, June Just because it's June, June, June It's June! Hello there on the Nancy B. - Lookin' for somebody, miss? - My husband. They told me he was with one of your hands, Jigger Craigin. Could be, ma'am, but I ain't seen him. The whole crew's gone ashore. They was, uh, figurin' on goin' on that clambake. Maybe you can catch up with them there. Thank you, sir. - She gone? - Yeah. Billy, is that true? Is there a clambake today? - Yeah. First one of the year. - Yeah. Why don't we go? - What for? - We'd come back rich. That's what for. Rich? From a clambake? You'd be the first one. Jigger's been the first one lots of times. What you need is a glass of beer. Come on, I'm buying. That clambake's just what I've been waitin' for. You couldn't find him, could you? - No. - Hello, Julie. Hello, Carrie. Julie, is Billy working yet? No. Mr. Snow says a man that can't find work these days is just bone lazy. Billy don't know any trade. He's only good at what he used to do. So now he just don't do anything. You know something else, Carrie? - Last Monday, he hit her. - Nettie. - Did you hit him back? - Oh, no. Well, I would have. I'd leave him. You don't understand, Carrie. You see, he's unhappy 'cause he ain't working. That's why he hit me Monday. Fine reason for hitting you. Beats his wife 'cause he ain't working. Is this before the clambake, after or what? It's while the clambake's going on. Now, once we're out there, suppose me and you get in a boat and come back in and did whatever we had to do. Then we got back. There's your alibi. We could just say, "We were on the island all the time. We got lost. " All right. What do we have to do? I mean me, what do I gotta do? Well, first, you go up to old sideburns and you say, "Excuse me, sir. Could you tell me the time?" I say, "Excuse me, sir. Could you tell me the time?" Then what? Then by that time, I got my knife in his ribs. - Then you take your knife... - Me? I ain't got a knife. Well, you can get one, can't you? - Does he have to be killed? - No, he don't have to be. But these New Englanders are funny. They'd rather be killed. Well? Hmm? I ain't gonna do it. It's dirty. - What's dirty about it? - Killing. What's the matter with you? We ain't gonna kill him. We're just gonna scare him. That's what the knives are for, to scare him. I ain't gonna do it, Jigger. Of course, if you've got all the money you want... I ain't got a cent. Money thinks I'm dead. Julie? I got some good news to tell you. 'Bout you and Mr. Snow? Carrie and me are bein' cried in church on Sunday. Mr. Snow, you startled me! Well, this is him. - Carrie told me a lot about you. - Oh. I told you a lot about Julie, didn't I? Enoch's nice-lookin', ain't he? Oh, come, Carrie. Steady and reliable too. Well, ain't you gonna wish us good luck? Course I wish you luck, Carrie. You can kiss Enoch too, us bein' such good friends and me bein' right here lookin' on at you. Why are you cryin', Mrs. Bigelow? It's because she has such a good heart. We thank you for your heartfelt sympathy. We thank you, Mrs. Bigelow. Billy! Billy. You know Carrie, and... This is her intended, Mr. Snow. - Mr. Snow? - Mr. Bigelow? I feel like I know you. Oh, yes. The man who owns the herring boat. You smell it over there, Jigger? Nope. Wind's in the wrong direction. - It's a good, honest smell! - It's a powerful, honest smell. Carrie. You still want me to offer him a job? What job? Mr. Snow here is thinkin' of puttin' on another boat and I was gonna ask him to offer you a job on it, but now I... Me? Work on a herring boat? No, thanks. Enoch, come along before you lose your temper and do something violent. Well? Go ahead. Say it. I insulted your friends, stayed out all night. I ain't workin'. I'm livin' off your cousin Nettie. - I didn't say anything. - No, but it was on the tip of your tongue. I was only gonna ask if... If you wanted to go to the clambake. It's a good idea, Billy. You've been actin' kind of nervous and edgy. Who knows? Maybe you might find the treasure. No! Ain't goin' to no clambake. Well, you got anything else to say? Like what, Billy? Well, like whether I'm hungry or not. I didn't have to ask that, Billy. I knowed you was hungry. You go and sit down, and I'll bring you your dinner. Do you wanna see somebody? Yeah, Billy. - That is, if he's home yet. - He's home. Would it be asking too much to know where he is? My husband is around the other side, waitin' for his dinner. Thanks. Hello, Billy. Well, what'd you come for? Well, I see you're still hangin' around your jailbird friend. What's it to you who I hang around with? One thing I can't abide is a common type woman. Everybody that gets mixed up with him finishes up in the jailhouse or the grave. Common woman. Put on a new coat of paint. You're startin' to peel, old pleasure boat. Well. What are you doin' here? You got a new barker, ain't you? Why don't you stay home and sleep at night? - You look awful. - Ah. Here, come on. Put your hair back off your forehead. Oh, leave my hair be. I, uh, hear you been beatin' her. Now if you're sick of her, why don't you leave her? - There's no use beatin' the poor thing. - Who beat her? What's all this darn fool talk about a beatin'? I hit her once. Oh. Now the whole town is talkin'... Next one I hear say "beat," I'm gonna smash... All right. All right, all right, all right. All right. I take it back. Look, I don't wanna get mixed up in this. "Beat her. " As if I'd beat her. What's the odds one way or the other? Why don't you look at the thing straight? You're sick of bein' married. Carousel ain't crowded without me, is it? Oh, Billy. You see? You belong out there and you know it. You wasn't cut out for a respectable, married man. You're the... You're... You're the artist type. You belong among artists. Tell you what, Billy. You come back... And I'll give you that ruby ring my husband left me. I don't know. I... Yeah. I might go back. Yeah. Yeah, I could still live here with Julie, and... - Holy Moses! - Well, what's wrong? Well, can you imagine? The girls would love that, a barker who runs home to his wife every night. Why, people would laugh theirselves sick. Well, I... I know I would. Yeah. I can hear you laughin'. Don't be so stuck on yourself. - You want anything? - Brought you your dinner. Billy? I... I got somethin' to tell you. All right. I've... Been wantin' to tell you. - In fact, I was goin' to yesterday... - Go ahead. I can't. We gotta be alone. Can't you see I'm busy here? I'm talkin' business. - It'll only take a minute. - Get out of here. - I tell you. It'll only take a minute. - Will you get out of here? - No! - What did you say? Ah, let her alone. She's got somethin' to tell you. And you... You've got somethin' to tell her. I'll be back in a minute. - Well? - Don't look at me like that. I ain't afraid of you. I ain't afraid of anyone. Go ahead and tell me what it is. Make it quick. Well, I... I can't tell you so quick. Why don't you drink your coffee? Is that what you come to tell me? No, but... But by the time you drink it, I'll have told you. Well? Well... Yesterday my head ached, and you asked me if... Yes? Well, you see, that's what it is. I'm gonna have a baby. Julie. Julie! You ain't mad, Billy, are you? Should you be walkin' up them stairs? - Sure, Billy. - Here. Let me help you. I'm all right. I'm fine, just as long as you ain't mad. Dee-dah-dah-dah Dah-dah-dah-dah-dee Round in circles Here. You'll be wantin' an advance on your salary. That's only fair. Now, you been out of work a long time. Go home, Mrs. Mullin. Well, what's the matter with you? Go on back to your carousel. Go on. Go on! - You mean you ain't comin' back with me? - Good-bye, Mrs. Mullin. What did she tell you? Some lies about me, I'll bet. - No. - I... Nothin' about you. It was about me and Julie and... As a matter of fact, Mrs. Mullin... I'm gonna be a father. You? You, a father? Good-bye, Mrs. Mullin. - Hey, Jigger. - Ah. Jigger! Julie's gonna have a baby. Well, what about it? Nothin'. My mother had a baby once. I wonder what he'll think of me! I guess he'll call me "The Old Man!" I guess he'll think I can lick Every other feller's father Well, I can! I'll bet that he'll turn out to be The spitan' image of his Dad But he'll have more common sense Than his puddin' headed father ever had I'll teach him to wrestle and dive through a wave When we go in the morning's for our swim His mother can teach him the way to behave But she won't make a sissy out o' him Not him! Not my boy! Not Bill! Bill! My boy, Bill! I will see that he's named after me I will My boy, Bill! He'll be tall and as tough as a tree Will Bill! Like a tree he'll grow with his head held high And his feet planted firm on the ground And you won't see nobody dare to try To boss him or toss him around! No pot bellied, baggy eyed bully'll boss him around! I don't give a hang what he does As long as he does what he likes! He can sit on his tail or work on a rail With a hammer, a hammerin' spikes He can ferry a boat on a river Or peddle a pack on his back Or work up and down the streets of a town With a whip and a horse and a hack He can haul a scow along a canal Run a cow around a corral Or maybe bark for a carousel Of course it takes talent to do that well He might be a champ of the heavyweights Or a feller that sells you glue Or President of the United States That'd be alright too His mother would like that. But he wouldn't be president unless he wanted to be. Not Bill! My boy, Bill! He'll be tall and as tough as a tree Will Bill! Like a tree he'll grow with his head held high And his feet planted firm on the ground And you won't see nobody dare to try To boss him or toss him around! No fat bottomed, flabby faced, potbellied Baggy eyed bully'll boss him around And I'm hanged if he'll marry his boss's daughter A skinny lipped lady with blood like water Who'll give him a peck and call it a kiss And look in his eyes through a lorgnette Say, why am I takin' on like this? My kid ain't even been born yet I can see him when he's seventeen or so And startin' in to go with a girl! I can give him lots of pointers very sound On the way to get 'round any girl I can tell him Wait a minute. Could it be? What the... What if he... Is a girl? Aw, Bill. Bill. What would I do with her? What could I do for her? A bum with... With no money. You can have fun with a son But you got to be a father To a girl! She mightn't be so bad as that A kid with ribbons in her hair! A kind of sweet and petite Little tin-type of her mother! What a pair! My little girl Pink and white as peaches and cream Is she My little girl Is half again as bright As girls are meant to be! Dozens of boys pursue her Many a likely lad Does what he can to woo her From her faithful Dad! She has a few Pink and white Young fellers of two or three But my little girl Gets hungry every night And she comes home To me! I got to get ready before she comes! I got to make certain that she Won't be dragged up in slums with a lot o' bums like me She's got to be sheltered and fed and dressed In the best that money can buy! I never knew how to get money But I'll try! I'll try! I'll try! I'll go out and make it or steal it Or take it Or die! Wish you could come, Julie. I'd rather stay home, really. You go and have yourself a good time. Julie! Julie? Julie? Thought you'd gone. I ain't goin' on the clambake, Billy. What do you mean, you ain't goin'? Course you're goin'. We're both goin'. - But you said... - Forget it. I mean, that was before. Gotta have a celebration, ain't we? Oh, Billy, I'm so glad. I'll see if Carrie and Mr. Snow have room for us. Oh, but... But you wouldn't wanna go with them, would you? Why, sure I would. You're puttin' the craziest ideas into my head. First I don't wanna go on a clambake and now I don't wanna go with Carrie and Mr. Snow. - Go on. Ask him. Go on. - All right, Billy. Change your mind, huh? - Yeah. - Good. Get the knife? No, I haven't got it. No. Don't worry about it, mate. Here's your coat. Billy! Billy! It's all right. - Come on! - Comin', Julie. See you later, mate. - Mr. Snow. - Hello, Bigelow. Cast off the stern line. Julie... After the baby's born, maybe we could go to San Francisco. - We'll take the kid with us, of course. - Sure, Billy. Sure. You think I'm just talkin', huh? You'll see. Carrie, can you imagine how it'll be when all the kids are asleep upstairs? You and me sit alone in the firelight. Me in my armchair, you on my knee maybe? Maybe. When the children are asleep we'll sit and dream The things that every other dad and mother dream When the children are asleep and lights are low If I still love you the way I love you today You'll pardon my saying "I told you so!" When the children are asleep I'll dream with you We'll think what fun we have had And be glad that it all came true! When the children are asleep we'll sit and dream - Dream all alone - The things that every other Dad and mother dream Dreams that won't be interrupted When the children are asleep and lights are low Lo! And behold If I still love you The way I love you today You'll pardon my saying "I told you so!" When the children are asleep I'll dream with you You'll dream with me We'll think what fun we have had And be glad that it all came true! When today is a long time ago You'll still hear me say That the best dream I know Is home When the children are asleep I'll dream with you Butter's melted. Thanks, Carrie. This was a real nice clambake We're mighty glad we came The vittles we et were good, you bet! The company was the same Our hearts are warm Our bellies are full And we are feelin' prime This was a real nice clambake And we all had a real good time! Remember when we raked them red-hot lobsters Out of the driftwood fire? They sizzled and crackled and sputtered a song Fittin for an Angels' choir Fitten for an angels' Fitten for an angels' Fitten for an angels' choir We slit 'em down the back and peppered 'em good And doused 'em in melted butter Then we tore away the claws and cracked 'em with our teeth 'Cause we weren't in the mood to putter! Fitten for an angels' Fitten for an angels' Fitten for an angels' choir Then at last - Come the clams - The clams Steamed under rockweed And poppin' from their shells Jest how many of 'em Galloped down our gullets We couldn't say ourselfs! Oh... Oh... Oh... This was a real nice clambake We're mighty glad we came The vittles we et were good, you bet! The company was the same Our hearts are warm Our bellies are full And we are feelin' prime This was a real nice clambake And we all had a real good time! We said it afore and we'll say agen We all had a real Good time! - Enoch? - Aye? You found the treasure last year, so it's your turn to hide it now. Enoch. And while Enoch's hidin' the treasure, all the rest of you get to work and clean up this island. Can't leave it like this for the next picnickers that come. Here it is, Enoch. Fall in and get to work, the whole kit and caboodle of you. Burn all that rubbish. That's a well-set-up little piece, that Carrie. Look. Ain't it near time for us to start? No. We'll wait till they start the treasure hunt, then we'll go together like a team. We'll get lost together like I said. Did you get the knife? - No. - Well, go ahead and take one. - Somebody might see me. - Take it so they don't see you. I got some sweet business to transact. - Miss Pipperidge! - Mr. Craigin! No fair peekin'. Oh, I didn't come here to find no treasure. - You didn't? - No. I come here to protect you. You did? What are you doin' out here alone? Don't you know it's dangerous? Suppose I was a different type of fella. You know, unprincipled? A fella who'd use physical strength to have his will. - There are such men, you know. - I know, but... Every girl oughta know how to defend herself against brutes like that. Now there are certain holds in wrestlin' I could teach you. Trick's that'd land a masher flat on his face in two minutes. - I ain't strong enough. - Oh, it don't take strength. It's just a matter of balance. A twist of the wrist, a dig with the elbow. Here, let me show you a simple one. This might save your life someday. Now, suppose a fella... ...gets a hold of you like this! Now you put your two hands on my neck. Now pull me towards you. That's it. Now pull my head down. Good. Now put your left arm all the way around my neck. Ah. Now squeeze... Hard! Tighter! Good girl. - Does it hurt? - Oh, you got me helpless. Show me another one. Uh, right... Uh... Here's how you can pick a fella up and send him sprawlin'. Now, I'll just stand here and you get a hold of... Uh, no. No. Wait a minute. I'll do it to you first, and then you can do it to me. - All right. - And you just stand still and relax. This is... This is the way firemen carry people. It is? You see how helpless you can make a fella if he gets fresh with you? Aye. Ah, Miss Pipperidge. - I'm just crazy for you. - Mr. Craigin... Why, just to see your lovely smile, I'd swim through beer with my mouth closed. Oh! Oh. Hello, Enoch. This is the way firemen carry people. Where's the fire? He... He was just showin' me how to defend myself. It didn't look like you'd learned very much by the time I came. That's 'cause you came too early. In my opinion, sir, you are as scurvy a hunk of scum as I ever seen near the water's edge at low tide. What's all the fussin' and fuzzlin' and wuzzlin' about? I never thought I'd see the woman I'm engaged to bein' carried out of the woods like a fallen deer. Oh, no, Enoch. He wasn't carryin' me out of the woods. He was carryin' me into the woods. Oh, no. I don't mean that. I think we have said all we have to say. I can't abide women who are free, loose and lollygaggin'. And I certainly would never marry one. Enoch! Aw, let him go, Carrie. - You don't know when you're lucky. - You keep out of this! - Ooh! - Enoch! Oh, Carrie. You could never be happy with a man like that. I'm only tellin' you for your own good. Believe me. I never see it yet to fail I never see it fail! A girl who's in love with a virtuous man Is doomed to weep and wail! Stonecutters cut it on stone Woodpeckers peck it on wood There's nothin' so bad for a woman As a man who thinks he's good! Nice talk. My mother used to say to me "When you grow up, my son "I hope you're a bum like your father was "'Cause a good man ain't no fun!" Stonecutters cut it on stone Woodpeckers peck it on wood There's nothin' so bad for a woman As a man who thinks he's good! - 'Tain't so! - 'Tis too! Oh, Enoch. Say you'll forgive me. Please say you'll forgive me. Leave me alone. Leave me alone with my... Shattered dreams. They're all I have left. - I got it. - What? - The knife. - Oh. Look, ain't it about time? Sure. Hey, Nettie. Nettie! - When do we start that treasure hunt? - Right now. Get your partners. Two men to each team. You got half an hour to find the treasure and the winners can kiss any girls they like. Billy? Billy! Billy? Are you goin' with Jigger? Don't you think that's foolish? - Why? - Well, neither one of you knows the island good. - You oughta split up and each of you... - Now look. We're partners, see? Let's go, Jigger. Stonecutters cut it on stone Woodpeckers peck it on wood There's nothin' so bad for a woman As a man who's bad or good! Julie! Oh, Julie. It kinda makes you wonder, don't it? Yes, it does, Carrie, and yet... What's the use of wondering' If he's good or if he's bad Or if you like the way he wears his hat? Oh! What's the use of wondering' If he's good or if he's bad? He's your feller and you love him That's all there is to that Common sense may tell you That the endin' will be sad And now's the time to break and run away But what's the use of wondering' If the endin' will be sad? He's your feller and you love him There's nothing more to say Somethin' made him the way that he is Whether he's false or true And somethin' gave him The things that are his One of those things is you So when he wants your kisses You will give them to the lad And anywhere he leads you, you will walk And anytime he needs you You'll go runnin' there like mad! You're his girl and he's your feller And all the rest Is "talk!" Common sense may tell you - Billy? Billy! - That the endin' will be sad And now's the time to break and run away But what's the use of wondering' If the endin' will be sad? He's your feller and you love him There's nothin' more to say You ain't gonna use the knife? Nah. I told you it was just to scare him. - What if somethin' happens? - Uh? - Something goes wrong. - Ah. Look. Supposin' we die. We'll have to come up before... Before... Before who? Before God. - You and me? Not a chance. - And why not? What's the highest court they ever dragged you into? Just police magistrates, I guess. Sure. You never been up before a Supreme Court judge, have you? - No. - It's the same thing in the next world. For the rich folks, the heavenly court and the high judge. For you and me, police magistrates. For the rich, fine music and chubby little angels. - Won't we have any music? - Not one blasted note. All we'll get is justice, and there'll be plenty of that for you and me. Say. Come on. Let's play some cards. It'll pass the time. We'll play twenty-one. I'll bank. What'll you bank? I ain't got any money. You can play on credit. I'll deduct it. - From what? - From your share of the money. If you win, you can deduct it from my share. Bascombe'll have 3,000 on him. That's what he usually brings to the captain, only tonight the captain don't get it. We get it. 1,500 to you, 1,500 to me. Go ahead and deal. I'll bet 50. Make it 100. Nothin'. Twenty-one. - This time, double or nothin'. - Double or nothin' 'tis. I got enough. - Twenty-one. - Are you cheatin'? Do I look like a cheat? - 500. - Say, you're a plunger, ain't you? Yes, sir. I'll take another. Ah, too much. - Uh, that makes 700 you owe me. - $700? Double or nothin'. - I'll stand. - Twenty-one. A natural. Why you... You stinkin' crook. You are cheatin' me. - I oughta... - Billy! Billy! Bascombe! Go, go! The time! The time! Excuse me? Say, excuse me, sir. Could you, uh, tell me the time? Gimme that money and be quick! - Look out. He's got a gun. - Don't move, either one of you. Drop that knife. Ahoy there, on the Nancy B! Captain Watson! Captain Watson! Stop, you! There's another bullet in here for you. Look behind you. What do you see comin'? - Two policemen. - You wanted to know what time it was? I'll tell you. For you, it'll be 10 or 20 years in prison. They ain't gonna put me in no prison. Where do you think you're escaping to? The sky? That's one of them. The other one escaped up Maple Street. Hey, you! Come on. Get up. You all right, Mr. Bascombe? Yes, Captain Watson. - Yes, I'm all right. - Come on. Come on. Get up. Why, those fools. Those silly fools. They tried to rob me. They didn't notice that I was comin' from the ship, not to it. Say, this man's hurt bad. He must have fell on his knife. The money they tried to kill me for is locked up in your safe. - Fools. - You. Get a doctor. Get somethin' to put under his head. - What's that? - Folks comin' back from the clambake. June is bustin' out all over - Stay back, please. - All over - I wish you'd go the other way. - What happened? We had an accident. A man was hurt. - Who is it? - Billy Bigelow. Please go back. - Billy Bigelow? Billy Bigelow was hurt. - Billy? Billy! - Where is he? - Please. Please stay back. He's my husband! Billy! Billy. Julie. Little Julie? - Yes. - There's somethin' I wanna tell you. I couldn't see anything ahead, and Jigger... Jigger told me how we could get a hold of a lot of money, see? And maybe... Maybe go to San Francisco. Yes. Tell the baby, if you want... That I had this idea about San Francisco. Yes. Hold my hand, tight. I am holding it, all the time. Tighter. Still tighter. Oh, Julie. Julie. - Sorry, lady. - Where is he? I must see him. Oh, please. Please. Sleep, Billy. Sleep. Sleep peaceful, like a good boy. There's something I... I never told you. Scared you'd laugh at me. I'll tell you now. I love you. Nettie. What am I gonna do, Nettie? What am I gonna do? Do? Why, you gotta stay here with me so I can be with you when you have the baby. The main thing is to keep on living. To keep on caring what's gonna happen. Do you remember that sampler you gave me? Do you remember what it says? When you walk through a storm Hold your head up high And don't be afraid Of the When you walk through a storm Hold your head up high And don't be afraid of the dark At the end of the storm Is a golden sky And the sweet silver song Of a lark Walk on through the wind Walk on through the rain Though your dreams Be tossed and blown Walk on, walk on With hope in your heart And you'll never Walk alone You'll never Walk Alone! Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So, that's the way it was. Yeah. When you first got here, you had the right to go back for one day, and you didn't. Wasn't there anything you wanted to do down there? Yeah. Yeah, I wanted to break Jigger's head. As a matter of fact, it's still a good idea. You won't find Jigger down there anymore. - You mean he's here? - No, no. He didn't even get this far. Hey, tell me. What do you got him doing? That's not your concern. Bigelow, you left your wife havin' a baby comin' with nothing to support 'em. Why'd you do that? I... I couldn't get work. And I... I couldn't bear to see her... To see her... You couldn't bear to see her cry. Why don't you come right out and say it? Why are you afraid to use the right words? Why are you ashamed you love Julie? - I ain't ashamed of anything. - Then why did you beat her? I didn't beat her. - I hit her. - Why? Well, we'd argue. She'd say this. I'd say that. And she'd be right. So I hit her. Are you sorry you hit her? I ain't sorry for anything. Look, I told you before. I ain't no special case. If I can't go back, just say so. I didn't say you can't go back. No, but you didn't say I could either. You're... You're just trying to make me sweat. No, I... I'm just trying to figure out what good you could do if I let you go back. You know, your daughter's down there. She's unhappy. She needs help. My daughter? My baby... Is a girl? My baby's a girl? No, she isn't a baby anymore. She's 15 years old. And she ain't happy, huh? No, she ain't, Billy. She's... You know, she's a lot like you. That's why I think maybe you could help her. Do you... Do you wanna take a look at her? Could I... Could I see her from here? Sure, you can, if you want to. Nah. If she ain't happy, I don't wanna look. Well, right now, she appears to be having a fine time. Yes, sir. There she is running along the beach there, got her shoes and stockings off. - Like I used to do, huh? - Yeah. Don't you think you better take a look? Well, what do I have to do to see her? Just look and wait. And the power to see her will come to you. Is that her? Pretty, ain't she? My little girl, huh? Let's go, Billy. All right, Billy. - Look, can she see me? - Only if you want her to. My father bought me my pretty dress. My father would've bought me a pretty dress, too. He was a barker on a carousel. Your father was a thief. Shame on you. Shame on you. - Shame on you. Shame on you. - Oh, no. - No! - Shame on you. Shame on you. Shame, shame, shame, shame! Shame, shame, shame, shame! I hate you. I hate all of you. Why did I have to look? Poor kid. I know what she's going through. Something like what happened to you when you was a kid, ain't it? - What did I come down here for? - To help her, ain't that so? Come on. Julie managed all right, I guess. Yep, she had to. She's got a lot of grit, Billy. Come along, children. Mr. Snow. Children. - Morning, Mrs. Bigelow. - Morning, Mrs. Bigelow. Well, it's so nice to see you. Won't you come in? Thank you, no, Mrs. Bigelow. Afraid we haven't time. Just came by for my wife. We have to stop at the minister's house on our way to the graduation. I tell ya. - Carrie, Carrie, we're waiting. - Coming. I heard you. You'll be to the graduation, won't you? Well, of course I will. Louise is graduating too, you know. - Carrie. - Oh, I'm coming, Enoch. What's the rush? I was telling Julie about that musical extravaganza we saw in New York. I'm a tomboy Just a tomboy I'm a madcap maiden from Broadway We also saw Julius Caesar. Ain't that a better show to tell her about? Not for me. Why, I took one look at them men in nightgowns and went right to sleep. Good-bye, Mrs. Bigelow. Come along, children. - Good-bye, Julie. - Pa, can I stay and talk to Louise? - No. - Just five minutes. - Let him. - Very well. Five minutes, no more. Still lollygagging. You'd think a woman with nine children would have more sense. If I had more sense, I wouldn't have nine children. Oh, Louise, your graduation dress is finished. You won't forget to come in and have it fitted. I won't forget, Mother. Did you have a good time in New York, Enoch? Oh, yes. We went to the top of the Statue of Liberty. We went to the aquarium. We went to all the theaters. - Enoch. Come here. - Huh? - Can you keep a secret? - Sure. What's the secret? I'm gonna be an actress. There's a troupe coming through here next week. I met a fella. He says he's the advance man or something. - And he says he'll help me. - You mean run away? Shh. I won't let you do it. Well, how will you stop me? I'll marry you. That's how. - Will you, Enoch? - Sure. Of course it'll be a little hard persuading Papa to let me marry beneath my station. - But I'll do it. - Beneath your station? Don't bother persuading your papa about anything. I wouldn't have that stuck-up buzzard for a father-in-law if you give me a million dollars. You're a fine one to talk about my father. What about your own? A cheap barker on a carousel. He even beat your mother. You get out of here, you sneaky little la-di-da. I'll kill you! If I want her to see me, she will? Little girl. Louise. Who are you? How would you know my name? Somebody... Somebody told me you lived here. I, uh... - I knew your father. - My father? And I heard what that little pumpkin head said, and it ain't true, none of it. It is true, all of it. Did your mother tell you that? No, but every kid in town knows it. They've been throwing it up at me ever since I can remember. I wish I was dead. What did your mother tell you about him? Well, she's told me a lot of fairy stories, about how he died in San Francisco. She's always saying what a handsome fella he was. Well, he was. Was he really? Well, he was the handsomest fella around here. You really knew him, did you? And he was handsome? What else about him? Do you know anything else good about him? He used to tell funny jokes at the carousel. And he made people laugh. Oh, did he? What else? Look, I wanna give you a present. I can't take presents from strangers. My mother wouldn't like it. I don't mean you any harm, child. - I just wanna give you something. - Don't you come any closer. You go away. You scare me. Don't send me away, dear, I... I just wanna give you a present. Something pretty. Something wonderful. Psst. What's that? A star. - Go away. - Please, darling. I just want to help you. Don't call me darling. Let go of my hand. Please, dear. I just want to make you happy. - Take it. - No. - Please. - No. - Please, dear. - No! Mother! Mother! Failure. You struck out blind again. All you ever do to get out of a difficulty is hit someone you love. - Failure. - Where is he? - I don't want her to see me. - Then she don't. She looked like she saw me before I said that. Oh, he's gone. I didn't make it up, Mother. Honest. There was a strange man here, and he hit me hard. I heard the sound of it, Mother. But it didn't hurt. It didn't hurt at all. It was just as if he kissed my hand. Go into the house, Louise. What's happened, Mother? Don't you believe me? I believe you. Then why don't you tell me why you're acting so funny? Oh, it's nothing, darling. But is it possible, Mother? For someone to hit you hard like that, real loud and hard, and not hurt you at all? It is possible, dear, for someone to hit you, hit you hard, and it not hurt at all. Julie. Longin' to tell you But afraid and shy I let my golden chances Pass me by Now I've lost you Soon I will grow in the mist of day And you never Will know How I loved you She took it, took the star. Seems like she knew I was here. Julie would always know. - She never changes. - Nope, Julie never changes. But my little girl, my Louise... - I gotta do something for her. - So far, you ain't done much. - I know, I know. - Time's running out. But it ain't over yet. Look. I want an extension. - I gotta see the graduation. - All right, Billy. Enoch Snow Jr. Miss Louise Bigelow. Our speaker this year is the most popular, best beloved man in our town, Dr. Seldon. He reminds me of that fella up there, that star keeper. Yep. A lot of these country doctors and preachers remind you of him. It's the custom at these graduations to pick out some old duck like me to preach at the kids. Well, I can't preach at you. I know you all too well. I brought most of you into the world, rubbed liniment on your backs, poured castor oil down your throats. I only hope that now I got you this far, you'll turn out to be worth all the trouble I took with you. I... I can't tell you any sure way to happiness. I only know that you've gotta go out and find it for yourselves. You can't lean on the success of your parents. That's their success. - And don't be held back by their failures. - Listen to him. Believe him. It makes no difference what they did or didn't do. You just stand on your own two feet. The world belongs to you as much as to the next fella. So don't give it up. And try not to be scared of people not liking you. Just you try liking them. And just keep your faith and your courage and you'll turn out all right. It's like what we used to sing every morning when I was a boy at school. Maybe you still sing it. "When you walk through a storm "hold your head up high. " You know that one? And don't be afraid of the dark Believe him, darling. Believe. At the end of the storm Is a golden sky And the sweet silver song Of a lark - I loved you, Julie. - Walk on through the wind Know that I loved you. Walk on through the rain Though your dreams Be tossed and blown Walk on, walk on With hope in your heart And you'll never walk Alone You'll never walk Alone!
