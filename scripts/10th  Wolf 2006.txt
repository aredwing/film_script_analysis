The day after my 12th birthday I found out my father killed people for a living. He was a made member of the Mafia. When I saw my father shot dead outside of our house I remember thinking he probably deserved it. And years later, when I got the chance, I joined the marines looking for something new to believe in. That lasted until February of 1991. Just outside Kuwait City and the Iraqi border. Fuck! Let me guess - you're from the government and here to help me. Get on your feet, tough guy. I tell you, you're a helluva good marine. Commendations, medals... Made sergeant 26 months ago. Pretty good. And then you assault an MP and you steal the colonel's jeep. Why? The colonel is a prick. Something like yourself. Tough guy, ain't he? Smart, too. Like your friends. Friends? What friends are those? Alright, let's see what you're looking at here. Bad conduct discharge, forfeiture of all paid allowances, confinement, 2 to 3 years at hard labor. You've really put yourself up the creek, old buddy. Maybe I've got a paddle for ya. Wanna hear more? Not particularly. You know this guy, Manny Matello? Hey, Rocco, make me a Cosmopolitan. Manny Matello was the mafia boss my father and my uncle Joe had worked for. I swear on Saint fucking Anthony if you put too much cranberry juice in it this time, I'm gonna kill your whole fucking family. You hear me? Hey, Rocco? Tell me, am I gonna be lucky tonight? The shooters were a couple of zips working for a guy named Luciano Reggio. Now Reggio is a major drug trafficker. He's also liaison between the Gambinos in New York and the Sicilian mob. In fact, New York sent Reggio down to whack Manny Matello. Take over the family. Imagine that, huh? A goddamn immigrant running the old neighbourhood. Do you remember a guy named Willy Dolan? Used to run a little book for Manny Matello. Sure, I knew Willy. We grew up together. Nice guy. Just looking to buy a house for his wife and kid. The market's changed. The price is a 100 now. It took me six months to put Now you want a hundred? You tell me you're gonna sell me a house for 87 grand, now you want a hundred. What's with the quibbling, Junior? Why are we quibbling? Price is a hundred grand. No quibble. You know what? You're a fucking pain in the ass to do business with, you one-legged motherfucker. - One-legged? - I'm taking my money and going home. You've got a problem with my leg now, huh? You don't even know how much money I'm saving you out of mortgage. That's how fucking stupid you are. How do you like my leg now? Tryin to chisel me, huh? Stealing money out of my pocket? Like the cocksucker you are! That's right - I fucking spit on you! Fucking piece of shit. What's this, Willy? What's this? You motherfucker. Willy was working for us. And we're gonna miss Willy. We had some things that we were working on and there are things we gotta keep working on. Which is why we're talking to you, tough guy. Now you wanna be a good citizen and help us out here? Hey, you wanna let me out of here? I'd like to get back to my cell. Please. Ok, so you don't care about truth, justice and the American way. What about Joey Marcucci? Care about him? He's family, isn't he? Yeah, he's my cousin. Another ignorant dirtbag. But we can't choose our family, can we? What exactly do you want me to do? I don't want you to do anything for me. But I'm gonna give you a chance to do something for your cousin Joey, the dirtbag. Because Joey doesn't like the idea this guy taking over the family business. I mean, sooner or later these guys will kill each other, they are gonna sit down and make some kind of a deal. Well I want you to be there, because I want Reggio. Do you understand me, tough guy? I want Reggio. You give me Reggio, I give you your cousin Joey. I vowed a long time ago I was never gonna become what my father was. Now I was going home to become something he was. My mother died giving birth to my brother Vincent. After my father was killed, me and Vincent went to live with my uncle Joe, my aunt Tina and my cousin Joey. Me, Vincent and Joey, we were more than cousins. We were brothers. - Your father got killed? - Don't make a big deal of it. Vincent, slow down. Even if it doesn't make you taller, it makes you fat. Go fuck your hand. Look at Joey. How's the steamfitters? It's great, man. My back hurts all the time, throbbing. My legs feel like somebody beat them with a hammer. Remind me to thank you in like a hundred years. You ain't 10th and Wolf, where you're from? I'm a friend of Ricky's. You know Ricky? Ricky Jerk-Off? That's what we call him round here, Ricky Jerk-Off. You know why? - Why? - Well cuz he's a jerk-off. Go get us a pack of smokes, will ya? What am I, your bitch? I'm buying. Watch my purse. Let me tell you something about Ricky Jerk-Off. Hey, Marcucci, you're talking to my girl. I ain't your girl. I just met ya. Shut your face. Hi, Ricky Jerk-Off, what's going on? Tommy, this is between me and your prick-face cousin over here. Is this a jerk-off convention? Fuck you, Marcucci. Tommy, I'm coming! Let go of me! Come on, Vincent! Get off me. Tommy, you're making a mess over here. We're gonna have to pay for all that stuff we broke. How much do you think three tables and a booth cost? Shit, I broke my chain, I lost my St. Chris. You sent me for the cigarettes on purpose, didn't you? - Shut up. - That ain't right. You don't think I'm tough? - Come on, me and you. Right now. - Shut up, Vince. Come on, Joey. Tell him I can kick his fucking ass. Not in your wildest dreams, Vincent. How's my eye? Let me see. Fucking yin and yang douchebags. It's Manny. Joey, come here. Manny! - What do you think he wants? - Shut up. Listen to me, son. It's your father, Joey. He's gone. Uncle Joe was killed the same way my father was. Left for dead like an animal in the street. Tommy, get yourself cleaned up. Go home and take your brother. Your aunt's gonna need ya. Now go on. Good boys. We're all gonna miss him. He was a good husband. A good friend. Thank you for everything, Manny. Thank you. Aunt Tina, is Joey home? What the hell do you think you're looking at?! Ain't you got no decency?! Toilet's busted. Take a walk. Move, I've gotta pee. Get outta here before I kick the shit out of you. Yeah, you and what army? Back in, I'll knock your teeth down your throat. Loser! Okay. You wanna know or you don't wanna know? You're old enough to decide. You either deal with these things or you don't. I wanna know. You're your father's son. His blood. It's not my place, unless you give it up. So, tell me what to do. Why is he giving him that newspaper? Oh, is he gonna let him read the obituary? How are you holding up? Okay, I guess. Poor Joey. - You guys should go home. - We're not leaving you, Joey. - Go home. - I wanna talk about this. Can we talk about this, please? He killed my father, Tommy. What do you want me to do? You want me to go to the cops? Ask him to say he's sorry? All we know is what Manny told us. Maybe Manny's wrong. I'm not saying that he is. But you do this right now, you'll kill somebody you're gonna live with that for the rest of your life. What, do you think Manny got it wrong? You know something I don't? Go home. Benedetto? Joey, what...? Joey! Tommy? Oh, God. He's bleeding pretty bad, Joey. What are we gonna do? I don't want him to die. He's not gonna die, Vincent. Oh, God. Look Vincent, I need you to do something for me, alright? I'm gonna get him to the hospital, but I need you to do something. What am I saying to you, Vincent? Listen to me! What did I say? - I gotta do something. - I need you to get rid of the gun. Break it up into little pieces, throw it in the river and dump the car, alright Vincent? What did I just say? Break it into pieces and throw it in the river. And dump the car, Vincent. Vincent, I need you to get it together. I can't, I'm sorry, Joey... Come on, Tommy. Joey, don't let him die! He's not gonna die, Vincent! Look at me! Tommy,I'm not... Look at me! I'm not going anywhere. Alright? I'm right here. Don't leave me, Joey. Stay awake. No, no! Don't leave me, Joey! I'm right here, Tommy! Don't you let him die! We have this. Please. Don't you let him die! Tommy, I'm right here! It had been years since I've been on that corner. But as the bus pulled away, I'd felt like i never left. Horvath and Thornton would have given me the money to live anywhere. But I went home, to aunt Tina's. I was worried about Vincent. Come here. You know Joey don't live here no more. He's got a condo over on Market. - Where are they now? - Probably at the club. Vincent's the manager. Vincent's working for Joey? What happened to steamfitters? He quit. Didn't he tell you? When did he do that? About a year ago. You like my new shoes? Vincent got them for me. He's a good boy, that Vincent. I'm so glad you're home, Tommy. We need you around here. ...Stinger missiles, C4, RPG's, everything. What's an RPG? Are you a complete fucking nitwit? I just told you 3 minutes ago what an RPG is. - I forgot. - Rocket propelled grenade. RPG - tattoo it on your fucking forehead. - Hi, Joey. - Hi, Brandy. How you're doing? - You've got a minute for me? - Yeah, absolutely. Come in. I'm telling you, this guy is like a fucking weapon supermarket. Can I stab you? Cops found Willy's car down by the river. Yeah? What did they say? Nothing. They asked me if I knew anything and they gave me back the car. - Have a drink. - I'm good. Have a drink. I need to know, Joey. I need to know if Willy's dead. I'm not gonna do anything. I'm not gonna go crazy, I just need to know so that I can move on. What makes you think I know anything, Brandy? Don't fuck with me, Joey. You know I've got the kid to think of. Joey, for three weeks it's like I'm living in mud. I can't do anything, I can't get out of bed in the morning. I know you for a long time, and you need to understand something. Whatever I tell you, I would only be guessing. Ok. He's dead? Why? Why would somebody do that? What did he do? I don't know. Ok, I want whoever did it dead or in jail. I want their kids to be without their father. I wanna know who did it. I can't help you there, Brandy. Fine, I'll find out by myself. - Settle down. - Fuck you! Settle down. Okay, fine. Go. Go. But where? What are you gonna do? You're gonna go to the cops? When was the last time they helped anybody from 10th and Wolf? So you can't do that, so what - you're gonna go after whoever done this yourself? Then you die and your kid ends up in some foster home. You want that? I've got a seven year old kid I can't feed no more. What am I gonna do? It's alright. You want a job? What? A job. You want a job? I'm not much of a dancer. You think I'd put you up on one of those stages? No, we're looking for a bartender. I don't know how to bartend either. Well good. That means you don't know how to steal yet. Vincent, come here. Meet me in the back. Brandy is your new bartender. Stupid me. I didn't even know I needed one. - How you've beenBrandy? - Good, Vin. Thanks. Give her the good shifts and give her a grand up front. - Okay? - Yeah. And forget about that other stuff that we talked about. That way nobody wins. I gotta get this. Yeah, hallo? Am I speaking with Joseph Marcucci? Yeah, you got him. Who is this? The Joseph Marcucci who resides at The Dorchester, 226 Market Square? Who is this? My name is Simon Liebowitz, sir, and I work for the Board of Health. The Board of Health? Who is this? Simon Liebowitz. Yeah, I heard you the first time. What the fuck do you want? There's no need to be rude, Mr. Marcucci. Tell me about the rats. Rats? Okay, you don't know about the rats. You couldn't have missed them. What fucking rats? The condominium where you reside has been quarantined due to an outbreak of rats. - Rats? - Yes. Yes. Big, fat, stinky rats concentrated in your bedroom area. You need to be more careful who you sleep with, Mr. Marcucci. Who the fuck is this? Leibowitz! Simon Leibowitz! Vincent, get out here! We've got a big, fat, fucking rat. He still has this jacket. Come here. They told us we were going in there to get a monster who has killed thousands of his own people. And just before we got the son of a bitch... - They make a deal? - They make a deal. Jesus. They lied to us and people died. A lot of their guys and some of ours. Some of my buddies. So I got drunk that night and beat the shit out of an MP and I stole the colonel's jeep and I went after Saddam myself. Get out of here. I swear to God. And I'd have got him too, If I didn't drive 30 miles in the wrong direction. Jeep ran out of gas just outside Kuwait City. That's my Tommy right there. For friends and family. It's good to see you, Tommy. I just got the call. Who's this? It's my brother Tommy. How you're doing? Army guy. Actually it's the marines. There's a little bit of difference. One is pussies, one is not. Hey, give us a minute, will you? What you gotta be a jerk for? Who called? Rocco. They want to arrange a meet. Why don't I save us both a little time and I can tell you to go fuck yourself... Reggio, Joey. They wanna meet. Rocco is the one who set Manny up. Hey, I think we should meet. Well... Hold up, guys. Stay there, Rocco. - Did you invite them in here? - A talk, Joey. A talk. Who's the grease ball ? That's Reggio's nephew. Take it easy. Fuck these ginzo motherfuckers. Tell your uncle I refuse to talk with any grease ball, moustached, foreign motherfucker. Do you want me to say it again? I'll say it again. Rocco? Let me ask you something. How does it feel to betray a life-long friend? I mean, how does your life like fucking the Judas? I'm just wondering. Tell your uncle: I see him, I put a knife in his kidney. Drop by anytime, guys. Monday scumbag nights. Drinks are half price. Bring a friend, you know? - What's the matter with you? - What's the matter with you? They were ready to share, you asshole. We can make a lot of money with Reggio. You better get off your high fucking horse because if there's an all-out war here's a bulletin - they win. They're looking to play this thing smart. Why don't we? I wish there was something I didn't know. You're a fucking asshole, you know that? - Hello? - It's me. Give me Horvath. What? You dangled Joey out there to hook me but you helped Vincent back in case you needed to twist the screws, didn't you? Everybody needs a whole card. I can't do this. - I want out. - Nah. It's too late for that. No, I want out. I can't do this. - Deal's off. - Hold on. Deal's off. Hold on a second. I just want you to listen to something, alright? "- Is it 500? How's 500? - It's un-negotiable." "Come on Vincent, I can't. I can't." "Thousand a week, Sid." "That's the number Joey gave you, that's what you gotta pay." "Otherwise I'll come back with a hammer and drive nails in your head." "And plus we gotta wreck the joint, too." Alright, that's enough. It's called extortion. And your little brother Vincent is in it up to his eyeballs thanks to your cousin Joey. Family. I don't give a damn about those cheap thugs. I want Reggio. If I'm gonna get him, I need it on tape. You gotta wear a wire. Wire? You didn't say anything about wearing a wire. I'm saying it now! You're gonna wear a wire. Look, you'd better straighten out your loyalties, tough guy. Who's it gonna be? Reggio or your brother Vincent? I want a guarantee Vincent walks and you go easy on Joey. Your guarantee is my word. We're going to lunch. Joey has to meet Reggio and you gotta get yourself in there. Wear the wire, and we'll stick to our end of the bargain. We know Reggio is setting up a heroin pipeline coming from the Golden Triangle through Sicily. We need to know how it's arriving and how the distribution is. That's a microrecorder. You tape it underneath your privates. Chances are they search you - they won't look there. Just make sure your dick faces whoever is talking and do everything you can to keep them out of areas with noise. Yeah. What's with the door locked? Some marine thing or something? I was taking a nap. Dinner's over. What's going on with her and Joey? He don't come by, he don't call. Her and Manny was like a whole two years after uncle Joey died. I take care of her, make sure she's got enough money and all of that. You wanna hear something? I've got around 128,216 dollars in the bank. You picked the right time to come home. What? How long have you been working for Joey? I don't wanna hear... - You could have wrote me. - Tommy, I don't wanna hear it. It's everything we said we didn't want, Vincent. No, it's everything YOU said. And then you said goodbye and ran off to join the marines. - What did you fucking do, Tommy? - Hey, watch your mouth. Let me bust my ass 8 hours a day for a lousy 300 dollars a week. Sorry Tommy, no can do. You're in over your head. - Stop it! - You stop it! Yeah. What? Now? Tell them you're eating now. I'm eating now. I gotta go. Alright, I'll go with you. I'm not a fucking baby! He didn't even call for you. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to curse. Will you save me a plate? I'll be back later. Smile, please. Tommy, I'm sorry. Get those puppies shiny. Junior has a thing about clean glasses. Who's Junior? He owns the drive with Joey stay as far the fuck away from him as humanly fucking possible. Say I said that and I'll call you a liar, make sure your ass is canned. Yeah, I've got it asshole! Give me a Crown Royal on the rocks. Vincent's brother Tommy, right? Yeah. Army? The marines. Brandy Brenner. You and me and Joey were in the Yeah. How's it going? Wow. You're really a bad liar... - Is that right? - Big time. Sorry? - Rock'n'roll. You're new here? - Yeah. It's a shot of rockin' rye and a bottle of rolling rock. Rock and Roll. Yeah. Learn something new every day, huh? Hey that's a nice haircut. Where did you get it, the army? Marines. Well Semper Fi, motherfucker. Hey, Semper Fi. Always faithful. Yeah, that's what it means. Semper fucking Fi! Are you gonna jump up on the pole? Bartenders don't dance. Are you gonna show me your tits? It's 9.50. I'm sorry, maybe one of us is in the wrong place. Hey, buddy. What's the problem? You got any medals? - Hey. - It's alright. Let me ask you something. We send our boys over there, they kill a bunch of Arabs that don't mean anything to us and then we pick up and leave before we take out the scumbag we went in there for. - Now what's that about? - I don't know. Like a thief in the night they take away our heart and our soul. We give them the best that we've got. My kids are dead, and Saddam is still alive. I don't... understand... Yeah, yeah. I was just kidding about the dancing. You're new, so I just tried to make you feel at home. Keep the change. I've got to talk to you for two minutes. You got it? - Can i kill ya? - Very funny. You're a very, very funny guy. Listen, listen... Listen to me. What's your Sunday look like? What? After church? I've got a guy who wants to sell us a tank. - A what? - A tank. - A tank? - Yeah, big fucking tank. I don't think so, Jimmy. Where will we park it? - I don't know. Behind the club? - No, I don't think so. Thanks for thinking about things, though. It's a good idea, no? Joe? Hey, how you're doing? You see those titties? I paid for those titties. Do you know how much doe that brings in for me? - You paid for those titties? - Yeah. Three times over. I'm thinking we should take this meeting, Joey. We can't take on the whole fucking Mafia. What Mafia? Vincent, the mafia in this city is gone. They're all dead or in jail. Do you know what elmatta means? It means "How much time do I get off my sentence?" Get out of here! Take care of that. Get off the stage! Jesus fucking Christ, Jimmy! How many times have I gotta tell ya? No beating up the customers. - I ain't doing nothing. - He's crazy. Should've left him out of it, Joey. I don't speak for Vincent. You let me down, Joey. I let you down? Well I guess it's not the first time. Did you tell me to go home that night? Did you tell me to go home? You didn't shoot me, Joey. You saved me. You still left. So, we're taking the meeting, or commiting suicide? Would you shut up? No, Vincent, I mean really... You should take the meeting. Really? Why is that? What's this Reggio need from you? They need me to keep quiet. After they killed Manny, they thought the transition would go smooth, but they didn't bank on us. They didn't bank on me. This ain't Palermo, this is my city. They can't afford a war, but this is what they'll get, Tommy. It's stupid. Stupid. You know what they need. That's a good piece of intelligence. But it's only worth what you make of it. You let them think they're using you, you get next to Reggio, you be a good soldier, when the time is right you cut the head off. No war. Nobody dies for Reggio. That's what I've been trying to tell him the whole time. Yeah, but you couldn't because you didn't graduate from 5th grade. Shut up. I was busting your balls. You know, I know you love him more than me. What is that? Don't say that. No, I know that. If you were in a dark alley, you'd rather have him there, not me. It's alright. There's nothing I can do about it. I just want you all to know that the world could crumble and I would die trying to be in that alley with you all. You're drunk, Vincent. Maybe I'm a little drunk. I'm still here waiting to be in that alley. I'm sorry. God, you're beautiful. I'm sorry, you've got to excuse me, I've got to take a piss. I'm sorry - a leak. Tell him I said thanks for everything. You're welcome. Could you get me another drink? She's off duty. Drink mine. I'll see you tomorrow. She's a good looking girl. Yeah, she's a good looking girl. I'm Junior, who are you? I'm Brandy, I started tonight. Dancing? Bartending. It's a nice car. Is this yours? Yeah. It's in my spot. Sorry. You're parking in the back with the rest of the girls. - Got me? - Yeah. You're a real fucking looker, you know that? What brought you here, Brandy? I'm a friend of Joey's. I'm gonna try parking in the back next time. Brandy, could you do me a favor? Tommy doesn't have a car. I was wondering if you can give him a ride down to the diner? - Yeah, sure. Yeah. - Thanks. - See you down there. - Are you coming? Yeah, I'll meet you there. - She's okay. - Yeah, that's what you said about Willy. Willy's okay. Turns out Willy was a rat. Forgive me if I question your judgement. Yeah, but you didn't know he was a rat until after you killed him. That somehow makes a difference? How do you know she's not a rat too like her scumbag husband? You go near her, I'll cut off your other leg, Junior. How are we doing, Junior? - We're doing great, Joe. - Good. It's bad enough I made the poor girl a widow, I don't want to make the kid an orphan too. Yeah. So how long is cousin Tom here for? Tommy's okay. Is there anybody around here not okay? That's what I'd like to know. Just stay away from Brandy. Thanks. Are you hungry? No, I gotta get home to my kid. My neighbor's watching him. Out to the left, three seats back. Where you sat in the 8th grade. Used to piss me off because you sat by the window, and I didn't. You should know how cold it was by the window in the winter. What did you say to that guy? The guy in the bar. I told him the best thing a marine could hope for is to die for his buddies. That's probably what happened to his son. Is that true? That's what they told us. How was it over there in Kuwait? It was hot and sandy. It's the desert, right? Who knew. I saw the three of you in there the night Joey's father was killed. You and Vincent and Joey. It was a fight. You looked like the three musketeers. The only thing missing were the big swords and the costumes and stuff. That was the night I told Willy I was pregnant. He's gone, you know? Yeah. It's good to see you. Hallo? Joey? Rise and shine, buddy boy, we're taking the meet. Start this thing all over again, me, you and Vincent. Ten minutes, don't be late. Back it up. Guys, we're coming through here. - Alex, are we good? - Yeah. I've got one leg and I'm here on time. They take this kind of thing as an insult. That's what it was meant for. Nice suit. Italian? Hey, Smiley, how you're doing? Buon giorno, Giuseppe. Joey, my name is Joey. Scusa. Capisci Siciliano? No, I speak English. I speak American. Me too. I'm from Carnasi. I don't give a shit where you come from. No. We're getting off to a bad start here. Either you tell me what's on your mind or I'm gonna go buy myself a rack of lamb and me and my friends are gonna have ourselves a little barbecue. Giuseppe, we talk like men, no? Not like a bulldog in the gutter. The bulldog - very ugly. So you shoot me in the head, than Sipio shoot you in the head. And what do you get? We've got a big headache. That's funny. - Ain't that funny? - Yeah, it's funny. I make you laugh. Yeah, a laugh. That's good. So let's talk business. Hey, one thing. This Rocco betrayed his friend. I don't work with someone like that. Either he goes or I go. You have a problem? We'll fix it. What the hell is that noise? It's a meat grinder. Everything is drowned out. What happened? Sipio killed Rocco. Why? Reggio told him to. Okay. Why? I don't know. He just told him to shoot him? Yup. And you have no idea why? You know, I didn't ask. That's very helpful. You've got to get me something I can use. Come on, do us proud, tough guy. Thank you, Jimmy. I've got a winner. What's wrong? It stinks. How do you say "stinks" again? Take a picture. It's a fucking clown. This is my wife. Isn't she lovely? She's beautiful. You wanna know something, Giuseppe? Angelina met your mother here. Really? Once, with Matteo. When you visit here first? How long ago? Ten years ago. Ten years. Really? Ten years ago. Your mother... She's lovely. Get me a fucking Crown Royal, will you? How are we doing? Great, if you want to know anything about the history of Italian opera, or the infinite varieties of olive oil. We keep working. It's a prescription for Ebuteral. I called it in earlier, I said I'd be here when my shift is over. It's over, I'm here. I'm the night manager. My son's athmatic. I need the medicine. I'm the night manager, the pharmacist goes home at midnight. He didn't tell me that. My son's asthmatic and I want his medicine. I'm the night manager. Jesus Christ! You say that again, I swear to God I'm gonna hit you over the head with this bottle of mouthwash. I called the prescription in, it's behind the counter, you give it to me or I'm taking it myself. Okay, I'm calling 911. My advice is to put the mouthwash down and step away from the counter. - Excuse me. Can I speak to you for just a second? Excuse me, I'm busy at the moment. I know. Just a sec. Let's take a walk. We'll be right back. Listen, could you use 500 dollars? Pardon me? Is that something you could use? Okay. Thank you. I'll have that Ebuteral for you, just one moment. Good guy. Nice fellow. One, two, three. Is that better? Yeah. Who's that? That's just a friend, babe. Sleep. Here, squinch down. Here. Make this flat. Here's the salamander. Put him there. Good night. Thanks. - He's a good kid. - Yeah. You ever been to Capri? The isle of Capri? I flew over it once. When I make enough money, I'm gonna take my kid and go someplace like that. Joey? What the hell? What did you do? Ten years? Tell me you weren't sleeping with Manny before dad died. What? You're crazy. Were you? What are you talking about? You're drunk. You're drunk! Get out. Go home! Leave! I'm talking about you fucking my father's best friend while he was still alive. You little shit! Get out! Get out of here! What? Did he know? Jesus, Joe. Did my father know you were fucking his best friend and parading in front of those fucking zips? Joey. Did he know? Yes. Of course he knew. What did you think? Yout think your father was stupid? And he lived with that? It was Manny. No. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. If pop couldn't stand up for himself, why should I? - Right? - No. Yeah. Joey, please. I'm so sorry. Please, Joey. Please. Please, don't leave. Please, Joey. How you say "thousand" again? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm great. That's what I said. - Stupido Americano. - Yeah, stupido zippo. Suck my fucking rigatone, alright? Jesus Christ! Holy shit! You could have warned somebody, you almost gave me a heart attack. What? He's your friend? What is all that bullshit you said? What is that? We were joking around! Well there'll be no more of that now, will there? You okay? My ears are ringing. Not a good thing. Not good. No shit. It was time to make our move anyway. I'm tired of eating with these people. Singing fucking clowns! We don't need this piece of shot anymore. Oh no? Well, I'm glad you're fucking happy. 'Cause all that money we were making, that's done. Fuck Reggio, he's next. Call and make a meet with Reggio. Today. Tommy, you're gonna help me clean this piece of shit up? He's stinking up the joint. Tommy, are you gonna help me out here? - Joey is gonna hit Reggio. - Really? People are gonna die, I don't want my brother to be one of them. Pick Joey up, get him off the streets, I'll guarantee you Reggio. How? I'll lie, I'll testify on the stand, whatever it takes. Tapes. I need tapes. Your testimony gives me nothing. I'll give you a flash, though. This hit might be a good thing. Come on, we've got all the information we need to shut down his pipeline. One thing we don't have is Reggio. If Reggio gets away, he moves someplace else, he starts another pipeline. Everybody loses. But if Reggio dies everybody wins. My advice is, you get the chance, put a bullet in his head yourself. You'll never hear from me again. Your cousin Joey walks, your brother walks, you walk. I even forget about Provenzano. You had the club bugged? I'll tell you what I've got. I've got murder one for Joey, I've got accessory to murder for you, I've got accessory to murder for your brother Vincent. Unless Reggio goes bye-bye. And you're one of the good guys. Hey, you keep your head straight. Reggio is a plague. Until we start killing kids by the truckload you bet your ass we're the good guys. Thornton, you stand by this? Kill the Sicilian, do the world a favor. Regulations say we've got to warn him there's going to be an attempt at his life. But there's a real good chance it will get lost along the way. It's over. Make the arrangements. Let the locals know and we'll need plenty of guys to take this thing down. I'll take care of it. Hey, it's me. Five o'clock, don't be late. How are you doing? Why did he have to kill him, Tommy? He wasn't a bad guy. He was teaching me Italian and everything. Vincent, listen to me. Joey does what he does, but it's you who I don't want getting hurt. Okay? I've been working on something... What are you working on? - Yeah? - Tommy, five o'clock, tell Vincent. Alright. Was that Joey? Yeah, we meet at six. That's good. So what's this you're working on? Forget about it. I'm gonna grab some smokes, you want anything? No, hold on a second. This one's yours. I have a clip for it in here somewhere. What's going on? Nothing. Vince is gonna stay to eat, I gotta go. You think I've never smelled this kind of thing in the air before? I smell them my whole life. You've let us down, Tommy. Will miss Missy the bartender please report to the front door. And will she bring her coat, please. There are errands to be run. This is the boss. Over and out. Five o'clock in the afternoon and look at the shape of him. Cut the fruit. You should've told him Tommy Vincent has got the right to make up his own mind just like you and me. Joey? Just in case? Just in case what? Yeah, you're right. Hallo? Where are you guys? - Joey pushed the meeting up. - You're full of shit, Tommy. Are you with Joey right now? Yeah, he's pissed. Tell him it wasn't my idea to leave him out of this. Joey wants you to know it wasn't his idea. - Are you setting him up? - What? - You are, aren't you? What the hell are you talking about? Vincent, calm down a minute. Are you a rat, Tommy? 'Cause I'm holding a wire in my hand and I wanna know what's it doing in your drawer. Huh, Tommy? Can you explain this to me? Vincent, I can't talk right now. But I'm taking care of things, I'll explain everything later. No, you explain to me now. Just tell me you're not a rat. Oh God. Just tell me you didn't leave me here so you could take Joey down. I promise you I didn't do that. - 'Cause if you did, Tommy... - I didn't. I'm gonna hate you forever. And I'll come after you. You've got to trust me, Vincent. Where are you guys? Put Joey on the phone, right now! No, don't call Joey. I'll call him myself. Call Joey and you're gonna fuck everything up, you understand me? You have to trust me. I love you, brother. I'm calling him, Tommy. Greasy prick is gonna be looking for a hug, when he opens his arms he gets three in his chest. - Tommy, you take care of Sipio. - Got it. Jimmy, you get the rest. I've got the scraps. After that we walk out of there like nothing happened. Like nothing happened. Fuck! Okay. Fucking immigrants. Oh shit. Jimmy? He sat us up, that fucking rat prick Junior! How you're doing, Brandy? I'm okay. Keeping those glasses clean? Nice and clean. Where did Missy go? Missy is gone. Do you miss Missy? Talk to me, baby. I'm here for you. Take your shirt off. When I took this job, they said I don't take my clothes off. I didn't tell you that. Joey did. Joey? Joey is a stupid scumbag motherfucker that got what he deserved today. Just like Willy. Yeah, you remember Willy, don't you? Another scumbag, chiseling motherfucker! You killed Willy? Take your fucking shirt off. Now! Willy tried to run, too. No, no, no! Pick up the phone. Come on, Vincent, pick up the phone. What the hell... Alright, alright. Lock up the streets. Nobody gets out. What the fuck? What did you do? Yeah, how are you doing? Is Harry there? Harry is a little busy at the moment. I'll wait. I think it's gonna be a while. I'm starting to see a little pattern here. Yeah, let me talk to Florio. Mr. Florio, what do I do about the monkfish? Fuck the monkfish! Florio's not here right now. Can I take a message? That's alright, officer, just tell him his grandmother called. Now I'm starting to get a little worried, Tommy. You and me both. I've got to admit, they didn't miss much. Hey, did I show you this? Look at that. - What is this? - It's the feds. Willy was working for them. Willy was stand-down. What do you think makes a guy like that turn? I don't know. Something like that. Ratting. There's no excuse, Tommy. Obviously somebody else took his place. Who? I don't know. You know, these bastards, they get their hooks on you and don't let go. It seems like a long time ago, doesn't it? "Shit, I broke my chain, I've lost my St. Chris." I'd give anything to go back to that night. Me, you and Vincent. - Hallo? - Hey, it's me. - Vincent. - Let me talk to him. What's up, brother? How did it go today? It was no picnic, I tell you that. Thank God I had Tommy with me. We missed you. So it went good? Vincent, cut the shit. Where you at? Where's Tommy? Vincent, what's wrong? What's the matter? May I speak to Tommy please? Sure. He wants to talk to you. Find out what's wrong. Hey, Vincent, it's Tommy. Where are you? I'm sorry I called Joey. I would have called you but I couldn't remember your number. Vincent, it's alright. Just tell me where you are. What does he say? I'm in that alley, Tommy. You know, where I'd said I'd be. What are you talking about, Vincent? Tommy, just find out where he is. I'm sorry for what I've said to you. I know you Tommy. I know there's got to be a good reason for whatever it is you're doing. Calm down, alright? Talk to me. Just tell me where you are... and we'll fix it. No matter what the problem is. - They wanted me to set you up. - Who? Give me the phone. You and Joey. But these grease balls don't know us guys from 10th and Wolf. Bastard. Vincent? Fuck these foreigner motherfuckers, Tommy! Vincent! - Listen to me! - Tommy, give me the phone. Fuck these motherfuckers where they breathe! Vincent? - Vincent?! - What's going on, Tommy? Adio. Ne, please! No! Listen to me! I will show you kill. They're fucking killing him, Joey! No! Listen to me! You're fucking dead! You understand me?! You're fucking dead! You're gonna die, you motherfucker! Let's go get Vincent. Jimmy was some piece of work, wasn't he? What's that? On to the gate! Fuck! Shit! You okay? I'm gonna go that way. Tommy? Don't get lost. I'm right here. Where is he? You're a disgrace to your heritage. Shut up! Fuck, Vincent. No! Bastard! Before you die I want you to know something. Not only did Matteo fuck your mother but he also killed your father. How do you feel now? Tommy? Joey? Hey, tough guy. I've got good news and bad news. I'll take the bad. Well with Reggio gone, we're not gonna need your testimony. And what's the good news? We've got this situation up in Boston. We're trying to nail some dirtbags. We could use your help. No thanks. That's too bad. We found Provenzano's body. And your fingerprints all over it. That's not what happened and you know it. You had the club bugged. Unfortunately, we were in an area with lots of noise so we couldn't make out anything on those tapes. That's a shame. "I've got accessory to murder for your brother Vincent." "I've got accessory to murder for you." "Unless Reggio goes bye-bye." "And you are one of the good guys." "Reggio is a plague." "Until we start killing kids by the truckload you bet your ass we're the good guys." "Thornton, you stand by this?" "Kill the Sicilian, do the world a favor." You can keep it, I've got plenty of those. You taped us? You're a half-ass gangster. You're a guinea no-good motherfucker! And I'm gonna blow your fucking head off. If this is really what the good guys do, you tell him to pull the trigger. Go on, tell him. Put it away. Come on. Put it away. This is wrong. I'll take care of it. Just put it away, come on. Take it easy. Go wait in the car, alright? You're a smart kid. You'd better stay smart. I got you a coffee. Somebody back there interested in a jelly doughnut? - That'd be me. - Alright. They say what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. Maybe that's true. Maybe it isn't. I only know this: It has to make you better. It has to.
