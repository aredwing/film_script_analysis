A bus plunged off a Tuen Mun Road bridge in 2003. 21 people were killed, turning Ting Kau into a haunted village. Recently, Tuen Man Yau Oi Estate became a popular site for suicide jumps. Tuen Mun is clearly... ...the most cursed of all 18 districts. Officer, were you told to film this? Yes, the footage is to be carefully examined. Superintendent orders: If we capture anything, we're on vertical patrol everyday. No way. Is he nuts? Watch what you say, we're still taping. Officer, don't disturb the spirits when they feed. - Inspector Gu. - Inspector Gu. Sir. What's the situation? All week... residents reported suicide jumps from the 10th floor. We found no bodies or bloodstains. Sir, we were expecting you. We waited for you before going up. Did CCTV capture anything? Nothing. Doesn't mean nothing happened. Everyone at the station believe it's... ...the supernatural. Victim dressed in red, jumped on the 14th day. This place is cursed! Could it be her spirit jumping tonight? You two losers... ...called the Special Crimes Unit for a suicide case. Did you talk to any witnesses? Inspector Gu has seen a million corpses... ...so he doesn't believe in ghosts. If it's ghosts... ...why bother investigating? We're cops, not ghost busters. But they hear terrifying screams every night. You... I never heard a ghost scream before. Look at this neighborhood. It's obviously a prank. You think the residents... ...are pulling a prank on us? Set your watches. It's now 22:35. We're on the ground floor of Oi Fai House, Yau Oi Estate. Guys, when did you receive the last report? 22:00. A 10th floor resident called reporting center... ...to report someone jumping. We arrived at the scene... ...35 minutes later. The five of us are proceeding to the 10th floor to investigate. Sir, may I be excused? Can I stay here with him? Whoever's not afraid, come with me. Count me in. You two stay here on stand by. Yes, sir! Stop shaking. You're coming with me. Yes, sir! [10th Floor] Sir? Isn't it odd for kids to be playing outside... ...at this hour? Could they be ghost children? Why not regular kids? Kids sneak to play when they can't sleep. Kids? Sir, I don't see any kids. Did you capture anything? Let me rewind. Nothing. Could I be losing my sight? Sir, maybe they just left? What were you shooting? Which unit does the witness live? Officer? Ma'am. Did you report a suicide jump just now? Yes, my husband made the call. We saw 'that thing' jump... ...every night this week. Where did she jump from? The open corridor. Officer, I really saw a female ghost in red! Officer, 1005 has been vacant for a long time. But we also...got a call from 1005. That thing is over there! Sir, I'll stay to finish the interview. Inspector Gu? Sir! You capture anything? Let me rewind. Nothing. Let's call it a day. See you downstairs. Why bother? Shut it off. Sir, maybe we should take the stairs? Are you kidding? We're on the 10th floor. We should've taken the stairs. Samuel, once we're in... ...you call the shots. I have a hunch we'll capture something on tape tonight. Don't worry. I'll have it all covered for you - Edmond! Hello. - You're here. Mr. Cameraman, make me look good. Me, too. Mr. Pong. He's your teacher? - Yes. Mr. Pong - Hello. I thought you'd be afraid to come. I knew you'd forget the flashlight...here! Thanks. You girls came prepared. The medium is here. 3rd Sister, thanks for coming. Wait for us! - Which one is the show host? - I am. How do you do? - He's the Village Chief - Nice to meet you. Chief, I thought you moved? Don't you need a guide for your paranormal expedition? Your presence is greatly welcome! Do we go that way? Yes. Let us lead the way. Good, let's proceed Yes! Samuel, let's tag it first. Today is the 20th of the 7th lunar month. The gate to the underworld is still open. Tonight's paranormal expedition at Ting Kau Village begins now On July 10, 2003... ...a 265M bus plunged off a bridge... ...into the Ting Kau Village below. Kiddo is now taking us... ...to the most haunted place in Ting Kau Village. Wah Yeung Primary School. This school is the locus of evil energy in the village. Children were studying here 10 years ago. After the accident it was abandoned. At Wah Yeung School on 318 Ting Kau Road... ...ghost screams can be heard every night. We believe it's the ghost of one of bus passengers. She fell through the roof and died on this spot. The place has been haunted ever since. Virtuous woman, Ginny Lui... Virtuous woman, Ginny Lui... I summon your spirit today. Come forth. Present yourself. 3rd Sister, is she here? She's furious. - I want to go. - Calm down. Which one is Pong? I am. She wants to speak to you. She's behind you. We've made contact. She is responding. Pong. Pong. I'm Ginny. Is it really you, Ginny? Don't go back to our old haunt. I'm dead. Our old haunt? Pong. I miss you. I miss you so much. If you really are Ginny... ...why are you still in Ting Kau Village? I'm trapped here. Is there something I can do for you? That's between the two of us. This is not the place to discuss it. Kiddo is missing! He was abducted by ghost! Our expedition may have suffered... ...its first casualty tonight. Could Kiddo have been... ...abducted by the ghost in red? Let's hope... ...we'll locate Kiddo quickly. Kiddo! Kiddo. Kiddo! Hey! What's that? What is that? Ghost fire! Ghost fire. Hurry! Run for cover! So far in this paranormal investigation... ...5 members of the group have gone missing. Were they abducted by evil spirits? We've gone from 10 down to 5. This is nightmare! To find our missing members... ...we've come to the village ancestral hall. Ancestors of Ting Kau Village, we beg you for help. We're lost in Ting Kau, being chased by evil spirits. Lords, show us the way out and help us now. It's Amy and Mr. Pong! Damn you, Carol. Where is everyone? Who sent this? Call the sender back. There's a creepy voice! I think it's a ghost. The spirit is jealous of the women around Mr. Pong. It's not going to let Amy go. - Help. - Chief. - Chief. - Chief, what happen? The ghost attacked me. Thank god you're here. Was that her? Did Ginny Lui tie you up? Yes, she beat me and tied me up! 3rd Sister? Should we keep searching... ...for the four missing? We have to! We must find them... before something happens to them. Are you all right? Did you eat something bad? That stink! Can't you smell it? Here it comes again. You know where your friend is, don't you? Kitty, where is that stink coming from? Ahead of us. It's over here. She's dead! We found a corpse at Ting Kau Village! Send someone! What happened to you? What do you want me to do? Kitty, who are you talking to? They already know. What do you want me to tell them? Damn you, Carol. Where's everyone? Hello. Is anyone here? Is anyone here? I'm not afraid of you. I'm not afraid of you! Are you seeing Amy's ghost? She's gone. Too many people here. She died horribly. We must catch the culprit so that she can rest in peace. Amitabha... go peacefully. [24 HOURS EARLIER] Welcome to 'Twilight Online' on the 19th day... ...7th lunar month. "Why is Tuen Mun the locus of dark energy?" We've invited Master Ng... ...to explain. Master Ng, a bus plunged off... ...a Tuen Mun Road bridge in 2003. 21 people were killed, turning Ting Kau into a haunted village. Recently, Tuen Mun Yau Oi Estate became a popular site for suicide jumps. Tuen Mun is clearly... ...the most cursed of all 18 districts. "I'm alone in bed watching Twilight Online". "What are you doing, Kitty?" "You're alone in bed?" "You're a psychic, why do you still listen to ghost stories?" "It's research for my yinyang.com". "The other psychics might offer something different". Speaking of Tuen Mun, we need to discuss Yau Oi Estate. Just last week on the 14th day of the 7th lunar month... ...a woman in red named Ngai Yor-yee... ...jumped to her death. Kit, the caller, was doing road repair near Ting Kau Village... ...the same site... ...where a bus plunged off a bridge 10 years ago. Over 20 people were killed then. It didn't end there. The village has been haunted ever since. So Kit... ...what do you want to tell us? A few nights ago, I was working on the road. An eerie voice suddenly came through... ...the walkie-talkie. She kept repeating, "Pong, I'm waiting for you". What happened next? We rushed back to the office. Master Ng... Could the ghost in red that Kit encountered... ...be a victim of the bus crash 10 years ago? From what I remember... Pass me the laptop. ...the victims included workers... ...teachers and students. I do recall a female victim dressed in red. She's the one who died in a red dress. Let's run a search. That's my school! Why did she say... ..."Pong, I'm waiting for you"? Pong could be someone that the spirit misses. Who are you calling now? Hush. Hello. Wendy, are you home? Why? You sound jumpy. The ghost in red being discussed on the show... ...she was Mr. Pong's girlfriend! Her name was Ginny Lui. She was a teacher at our school! How did you find out? Check out the 2003 photo album on our school website. That's her in the photo with Mr. Pong. But she died in the bus crash in 2003. Hello? Wendy? Are you still listening? Go on. Let's keep this secret from Kitty for now. You know how she posts everything online. She always has to be the boss... ...with her psychic powers. I must question Mr. Pong tomorrow! Why are you so upset? Are you jealous of a ghost? You're crazy. I'm looking at our chart-room now. There's a ghost picture. The sender is... Jasmine. Jasmine said she took this photo... ...at... ...she took this photo... ...at 318 Ting Kau Road. Let's go on... ...a paranormal expedition to Ting Kau tomorrow night. Those interested in goin email me now. [Delete] You leave Pong alone. You leave Pong alone. Excuse me. Where's Inspector Gu? - The basement. - Thanks. One more. Stop. Let me think... Madam. Is Inspector Gu inside? What's up? This is the information from Tuem Mun Station. We need Inspector Gu's help on a case. Don't stop. Keep going. Shovel the sand. Madam, how much longer will he take? Who knows? Just wait. What is the case? Sir. On the 14th day of the 7th lunar month... ...a woman in red jumped to her death at Yau Oi Estate. Her name is Ngai Yor-yee. Autopsy results confirm... ...she died from multiple blunt force traumas. But since her death... ...we've received daily reports from Yau Oi residents. They witnessed Ngai jumping again. The victim was in the box for 3 hours. The air almost ran out... We suspect that Ngai's spirit... ...returned to haunt Yau Oi Estate. How should we proceed, sir? The victim died at 11:45 p.m. She was in there for 3 hours. The air almost ran out. Call someone. I'm sorry... She called someone. But who? Open up! Open up! Get him out. Open up! Sir, are you okay? She called someone from inside the crate. After the victim was abducted, she called emergency... ...and her husband. Arrest the husband. He's the murderer. He must have been nearby Yes, sir. Don't conclude it's a ghost case... ...from the get-go The victim, Nagi Yor-yee, age 22... ...immigrated 3 years ago. Her last address was... ...Unit 4A, 50 Fok Lok St, Shum Sui Po. Ngai didn't have any close friends. She had one relative in Hong Kong... ...an aunt... ...who died the year before. Boyfriends? None. Single... ...and pretty. She visited a friend then jumped? Highly unlikely! Tuen Mun is a popular site for suicides these last few years. Perhaps she chose... ...to end her life there? Nagai was unemployed and financially dependent on her aunt. She committed suicide out of despair. - Who called first to report her suicide? - A new immigrant. His name is Shum Ji-yang. He lives in Shum Shui Po. Did someone push Ngai... ...then made it look like suicide? Sir, my name is Bee. I want to apprentice under you. You have to get a transfer here first. I've taken a week off to come work under you. Because you're the best! Is that a 'yes'? Ma'am. Do you have a tenant from the mainland... ...named Shum Ji-yang? Are you a loan shark? Police officer... investigating a case. Last room. Wow. Handsome fellow. Looks more like a gigolo than a construction worker. He may be at work. He went to burn offerings to his dead wife. Ma'am, you gave me a heart attack. It's the 7th day after her death! Is that her? She's the one. Are you sure? I heard she committed suicide last week. So I told Mr. Shum not to stay here tonight. I don't want guardians of the underworld coming here. Is Mr. Shum employed? Not presently, I think. Does he have money for rent? Never late. Sir, where do we look for Shum? Ngai's home! Ouch! Sorry. Be careful. Are you scared? Very! Don't you get tired of playing all day? Hey, no need to get upset? What's wrong with you today? You won't understand. I've been haunted. What? Move over. Sir. Why did we come to Ngai's home? To assess her mental state... ...before concluding it was suicide. I see. Damn cop, you want me dead, don't you? Take one step closer and I'll shoot! Police! Open up! Come out or I'll shoot! Sir, what happened? You drew your gun. What were you doing in there? Taking a leak! What's wrong? Is everything okay? Yes. Sir, what happened just now? Let's look inside. Okay. Move! Look at all the Tuen Mun news clippings. Shum may have a key to this place. You think Shum set this up... ...so we'd think Ngai committed suicide? Sir, the door is locked. Isn't this house abandoned? Sir, something's wrong. This place is so rundown... ...Shum wouldn't hide out here of the crate murder victim. Inspector, we found the husband. He confessed to the murder. Okay. What now? You stay here Why? You think Shum will return here? Wait, Inspector! Amy Luk, Wendy Wong, Kitty Cheung, Carol Ko. Stop playing. Come out. Stop playing. Were you scared, sir? Wendy Wong. I told you not to sneak up from behind. That's childish! Mr. Pong, we got you! Did we scare you, sir? Mr. Pong, we have a few questions for you. Follow us. Mr. Pong... Was Ginny Lui your ex-girlfriend? Where did you first meet? At school. How long were you dating? You haven't dated since her death 10 years ago. Because you still love her? 10 years? How could you not date for 10 years? Let's stop here. You asked for me? Why has she returned to haunt the others? What do you think she wants? I think she wants you to join her. I agree. Does that scare you, sir? If that's what she wants... ...why bother with the others? Enough! I don't believe in ghosts. You studied science. You should place your trust in science and reason... ...not listen to ghost stories. They mess up your mind. Are you joining the paranormal expedition tonight? No. You shouldn't go either. You should all be in bed by midnight. Oh, my god. Since when are you my dad? Mr. Pong, your ex attacked me last night. Don't you believe me? See for yourself. - That's scary. - She did this to me. Fine. I'll find out tonight... ...if it's really Ginny's spirit. Okay? Hurray! - He's coming? - Yes! Chief, listen. They gave us 3 months to finish the job... ...or we don't get paid. Tell them it's not easy evicting an entire village. Watching all these ghost shows... ...gives me an idea. What do you think? Ghosts? Will it work? It's an old trick. You did it again, Gu. You solved the crate murder case! Do you believe in ghosts? Why? Did you see a ghost? Don't know. Maybe that's why you have trouble sleeping? How did you know I couldn't sleep? I can see it on your face. Do I look that bad? Ghosts and people are worlds apart. Can't you tell the difference? There's no absolute proof... ...that ghosts exist. True. Policemen rely on hard evidence. Give me the concrete details then. I love a good ghost story. Don't you have an important engagement? Ah... l almost forget about my cousin! Cousin! We're not related at all. Alright, Inspector Gu. You beat me here again. 10 years flashed right by. I wonder if Ginny adapted to this place? Let me tell you something. One night, two officers walked the night beat. They took a shortcut through a cemetery. Halfway... ...they heard clanging noises behind them. They were scared stiff. Afraid to even turn around. So they ran like crazy. As they ran, they saw a man... ...carving a gravestone. It was etched with the name Cheung Sam. They checked the man out and said... ..."What're you doing here?". The man looked up and said... ..."They got my name wrong!". A ghost story? Do you think it'll scare the girls? I thought you were all work no play. We all need company sometimes. What about you? Dating anyone? Haven't found the right one. "See you at Ting Kau Village 24:00" My students are going on a paranormal expedition. Expedition? A field trip to a site thought to be haunted. High Street is long gone. Where else can you go? Ting Kau Village. If my cousin ever appeared, she'd appear before us. Go find out. If my cousin ever appeared, she'd appear before us. I think so, too. The 7th lunar month always means trouble. I'm working on the case... ...of a woman who committed suicide on the 14th. Sir. Sorry, I stepped out. I just saw Shum buying paper offerings. He should be back soon. Sir. Accept these offerings... Mr. Shum. Police. Are the offerings for your wife? Stay right here! What's wrong, officer? Why did you run from us? You killed your wife... for the insurance money! What are you talking about? Ngai Yor-yee! I haven't seen Ngai since we broke up a year ago. You must be mistaken! You reported her suicide... ...and just burnt offerings to her. Yes, I paid her a visit the other day... ...because her aunt died. Not to borrow money? I did ask for a loan but she didn't let me in. She acted strange so I followed her when she came out. I thought she was meeting another man. Instead, she just jumped from the 10th floor. I told the police I didn't know her to avoid trouble. Are you telling the truth? Why don't you ask her friend... ...Fung? Officers get a discount! Are you Fung? It's the most common hooker name. You know her? Let's talk at your place. It's her 7th night, that's why I work outside. Are you afraid she'll drop by? Do you know why Ngai killed herself? After her boyfriend bled her dry... ...she couldn't handle it and became unstable. Her boyfriend was Shum Ji-yang, correct? Did Ngai purchase life insurance? She did. Did she make Shum... ...the beneficiary of her policy? Yor-yee was depressed... ...she tried to commit suicide many times. She'd never... ...make that bastard the beneficiary! One more thing. Do you know why... ...she went to Yau Oi Estate that night? Beats me. Handsome, want to do business with me? Your price? That means Ngai's death was suicide... ...not murder. Hello. Inspector, someone jumped at Yau Oi again! Copy. Do you need me there? No need. Bee will go with me. Spare you the fright. That 'thing' really likes Yau Oi Estate. Let's go up to the 10th floor... ...and capture the ghost on tape. The five of us... ...are proceeding to the 10th floor to investigate. Samuel, once we're in, you call the shots. Today is the 20th of the 7th lunar month. The gate to the underworld is still open. Tonight's paranormal expedition at Ting Kau begins now. This school is epicenter of the evil energy in the village. This is the first stop of tonight's expedition. If you really are Ginny... ...why are you still in Ting Kau Village? Help! Turn on your flashlights! Kiddo is missing! - Missing? - He was abducted by ghosts! We may have suffered... ...our first casualty tonight. Was Kiddo... ...abducted by the ghost in red? Shouldn't we be looking for Kiddo? Why are we here? Here. This is the place. Why bring us here? This is where the bus crashed 10 years ago. This memorial stone was laid by villagers... ...to appease the spirits of the dead. So this is where the bus crashed. 3rd Sister... ...does this stone... ...have any power over spirits? How can a stone possibly... ...placate angry spirits? Visiting here during the 7th lunar month... ...is bound to anger the ghosts. Are you trying to do us in, Chief? This is a paranormal expedition. You came to see ghosts, didn't you? Stop arguing. Let's find Kiddo first. - What's that? - A ghost fire! It's a ghost fire. Run for cover! You calling Amy? No answer? Did they just call? It's just the two of us now. Forget about them. Amy Luk, what are you doing? Stop pretending, Mr. Pong. You were staring at me during class. What is this? I heard you like to play with female students. Why not me? It's Amy and Mr. Pong. Who sent this? Mr. Pong! Why are you here? I followed you two. So you saw everything. You lost. Mr. Pong kissed me. I saw him pushing you away. Don't waste your time. It's no use sending him emails every night. Don't you know... ...his heart is still with his ex? That's enough, Amy. I quit. This is no fun. You're so cheap! It's just a game, Wendy Nothing is free. Now we're even Mr. Pong, where are you going? You are part of the expedition. I called the show to report the ghost sightings. People here are strange. They don't talk to strangers... ...and shut their doors at nightfall. What's your name? Call me Jasmine. Jasmine. What's so funny? Nothing. It's late, why are you here by yourself? I was curious about your paranormal expedition. Won't your family be worried? I have no family. Where do you live? I'll walk you home. I lived at 318 Ting Kau Road. Okay. Help me up. No need to escort me. You don't know the way! Your friends are over there. Go find them. Is anyone here? Come here, bitch. What are you doing? It's not my fault she can't see me. You're useless. I need footage for the internet. Go out and scare her again. Scarier this time! I'm not afraid of you. Honey, she's hurt! She slipped. No big deal There's so much blood! Calm down. Damn. She's dead. Let's call the police. We can't! Let's go! Honey, she'll die if we don't call the police! It's no use. She's already dead. Doesn't that make us murderers? No! Her death was an accident. We're not responsible! Honey, let's go. You women are useless. Remember... ...don't tell anyone what happened here. Don't leave me here! Hide here. Don't let anyone find you. Don't go! - Village chief. Village chief. - Kiddo. Kiddo. What took you so long? Hit by a ghost. I'll start. Hit by a ghost. - Tied me tight! - I can't... ...if you keep moving. Wendy. Did you already send the video? I'll lose my job because of this! No, you won't. Just admit you like me. I can tell the Headmaster... ...that Amy forced herself on you. Wendy Wong... ...you're sick! Why are you treating me like this? Why are you here? Did you take your medication today? I don't want to! The drugs make me fat! Let's go back and talk this through? [THE PRESENT] Ghosts are killing people! Ghosts are killing people! Police! Step aside! Keep quiet! Reporters, step aside! Let us do our job! Shut up. Collect statements. Yes, sir. Your name? Carol Ko. Carol Ko... who do you think is the killer? Don't worry, just tell us what you think. I think the ghost killed Amy. And you? Amy said she doesn't know who killed her. Sir. Where have you been? With the coroner. He confirmed the cause of death... ...was blunt force trauma to the head. That's obvious! Yes. But the missing student and teacher... ...just turned up at a nearby beach. Is the teacher all right? He's fine. The female student is dead though. These six claim... ...to have seen a ghost dressed in red last night. They all say the ghost killed people. The long-haired girl... ...even claims to be psychic. What do you think? Sir! Hey. Are you all right? What happened last night? According to the teacher... ...the victim on the beach is Wendy Wong. When she caught him with another student... ...she knocked him out. According to him, Wong was emotionally unstable. Sir. - Inspector Gu - You're quick. It was a quick walk from the village. The preliminary cause of death was drowning. Based on the swelling... ...the body was submerged for 5 to 6 hours. The time of death was probably 3 a.m. this morning. No obvious injuries other than... ...scratches on the soles of the feet. The victim probably walked for awhile... ...before jumping into the sea. Thank god you're not a coroner. Teenagers these days... ...all seem ready to commit suicide over love. Someone probably gave her reason to jump. Inspector. Based on the currents... ...the victim likely entered the water at the pier... ...then washed ashore this morning. Madam, all yours. We need to confirm something with you. We have nothing to do with the girl's death, sir. Stop pretending. We have the evidence. At most you can charge us for pulling a ghost prank. There's no proof that we killed anyone. - Village chief - What took you so long? Hit by a ghost. Hit by a ghost. Don't leave me here! Do you believe in ghosts? Those three have obviously seen a ghost. Why else would they confess? Do you believe? You know why... ...some people are predisposed to seeing ghosts? Because they have too much cortisol... ...the stress hormone. It keeps them in a constant state of fear... ...causing hallucinations. That's why they see ghosts. So you're an expert. My doctor filled me in. But the psychic student doesn't fit... ...into the profile. She wasn't scared. She even claimed... ...she talked to her classmate's spirit. Teenage girls lie all the time. They can't be trusted. That means you don't believe in ghosts... ...or that people can see ghosts. Madam. I'm fine. I don't need any coffee. You're still here? Finish up and go. Okay. Another ghost sighting at Yau Oi Estate? Where did the uniforms go? Too afraid to show? Hold the lift! Wait! The lift isn't going to fall, is it? Press the alarm. Sir, can we go now? How long did I sleep? Were you asleep? You drove us here! It can't be. Hold the lift! Take the next one. Wait! Sir. I should go back down. You brat. Look at all the goose bumps on your face. Is there something up there? If there was a ghost nearby... ...they say you'd literally feel a chill... ...down your spine. Is that true? I'll shut up. Our station regrets what transpired... ...during last night's expedition. Let's all take a moment to commemorate the deceased. - 3rd Sister? - Yes. Why are some people able to see ghosts? They either have second sight or bad luck. What are the signs of bad luck? Green aura and blank eyes... ...are the signs of having bad luck. How do people get second sight? Some are born with it. Some develop second sight after eye injuries. Others have their eyes tainted by corpse blood. Sir. Did that ghost appear before you... ...because she wanted your help? Then why did she try to scare me? 3rd Sister, we both know... ...your so-called channeling was just an act. I'm old and my powers are limited. So I used a couple of tricks. Why? Do you want to expose me? I know that Ginny Lui's spirit cannot rest. I know you're psychic. Your psychic mumbo jumbo is out. I don't just see spirits. I can enter their world and even touch them. You're not that special for a psychic. I think I'm quite unique. I think something traumatic happened to her 10 years ago. If you see her again... ...ask her what she wants. We'll see. The school discovered female students... ...involved in prostitution. They sell their bodies for money. Some female students even harass male teachers. They develop obsessive crushes... ...on their teachers... ...and try to ruin their reputations with sex. Class... ...do you think an affair with a teacher will ever end well? Seducing male teachers is a shameless act. It's as immoral as prostitution. Chen Xiaoman, stay away from my boyfriend. Miss Lui, he likes me. He wants to have sex with me. Stop deceiving yourself. You're old and old-fashioned. You don't suit him If it wasn't for you, we'd be together already! Xiaoman... ...your mom went through a lot to raise you. She'd be deeply hurt... ...if you were expelled. Bravo. Bravo, bitch! That's it! Chen Xiaoman, tell your mom to see me after school. I need to talk to her. Wait, don't go! - You can't leave! - Bitch. - She's going jump! - Bitch. You can't leave her there. Mr. Pong is being shamed online! No way. Headmaster, read this. Pong screws up again. Pong, where are you? Did the blogger tell the truth about 10 years ago? Did the suicide victim have a crush on you? Ginny thought Chen photographed us. That's why she confronted her. Stay away from my boyfriend! Looking for me? I know you like me. Chen, what are you doing? What are you doing? - Ginny didn't know about... - I know you like me! Chen's illness. She felt responsible for the death of Chen. So she took all the blame to protect you. Why didn't you tell the truth earlier? I was afraid to lose my job. Thanks to your cowardice... ...another student died. 10 years ago it was Chen Xiaoman. 10 years later it's Wendy Wong. What were you thinking? The school already suspended me. Maybe that's why... ...I saw Ginny recently. I saw her spirit. Why were you all able to see her? What about me? What's going into the report? Will it include ghosts? I haven't decided Actually, ghosts aren't that scary. Don't you think? Just wait until you see one. Thanks for everything, sir. Bee, you forgot something! Has Bee left? Call him back. Don't. Just let him go. But he... HKPF Officer Died in Line of Duty Name: Bee Chen Is he the same Bee that you saw? This prank has gone too far. Everyone at Tuen Mun Station... ...knows he died. - Inspector Gu. - Inspector Gu. Why not regular kids? Kids sneak to play when they can't sleep. See you downstairs. Do you believe in ghosts? My doctor filled me in. Don't stop. Keep going. What did he say? He's possessed Let's go up to the 10th floor and capture the ghost on tape. I saw Ginny's spirit. Why were you all able to see her? What about me? Remember 3 months ago... ...an officer from Tuen Mun was killed in a shootout? Some are born with second sight. Some get it when their eyes are tainted by corpse blood. Are you okay? Mrs. Wong? I'm Wendy's teacher, Kin Pong Please come in. I've come to apologize. Wendy loves steamed pork with pickles I never imagined... I'm so sorry. Mr. Pong... You look weak. Problems sleeping? Sit down. Stop blaming yourself. I failed Wendy, too. I didn't know she stopped taking her meds. It was my fault. I didn't watch over her. I know what my daughter was like. She's always been very stubborn. Once she loves you... ...she never lets go. I should be the one to apologize. I didn't teach Wendy well. Mr. Pong, I'm busy. Please leave? Goodbye, Mrs. Wong. I'm sorry, Wendy. I'm sorry. Why won't you leave me alone? Were you scared, sir? Were you scared, Mr. Pong? Do you know... ...how to pacify an angry spirit... ...so she can move on to the next life? Mrs. Wong... ...are you being haunted by a vengeful spirit? No. It's my daughter. I think she's obsessed with someone else... ...and can't let go. I see. 3rd Sister, can you help her? You must convince her... ...to let go of her resentment. "I deserve to die in front of Wendy Wong." Only then she can move on. Did that ghost appear before you... ...because she wanted your help? If you're a Buddhist... ...reciting Sutras to the deceased... ...may ease her soul. Avalokitesvara when practicing the Prajna Paramita... ...perceives that all five skandhas are empty and is freed from all suffering. Shariputra... ...form does not differ from emptiness... ...that which is form is emptiness. The same is true for feelings, emotions and the intellect. All dharmas are marked with emptiness. They do not emerge or vanish. Pong! Don't do it! Wendy Wong! Daughter, rest in peace. Pong! Pong! What happened? You wanted to kill yourself! How did you get here? I don't know. It felt like someone was pushing me. Luckily you sent me a message. Otherwise nothing could have saved you. What message? Ginny told me to save you. Bring me a Jasmine flower... ...and I'll marry you. Call me Jasmine. I lived at 318 Ting Kau Road. This is your Jasmine flower. You can't see or feel her presence. She can see you... ...but she can't touch you. Her spirit never left... ...so she could watch over you. Imagine how she's spent the last 10 years? Those who die before their time are trapped in limbo. Endlessly reliving the moments prior to their death. They face the fear and trauma of the bus crash... ...over and over. Please let her go... ...and set yourself free. I don't want to stop her spirit from moving on. Both of you deserve a new beginning. I wish her happiness. It's better to cut your suffering short. Ginny would feel the same. Bee said my cousin's spirit appeared before me... ...because she needed my help. Is Bee your subordinate? No. He's from Tuen Mun station but came to train with me. Inspector Gu, why did you seek psychiatric help? Did you take the drugs I prescribed? What for? Because you couldn't sleep. I couldn't sleep... ...because I was too busy to sleep. Did you know insomnia is a symptom of deeper mental issues. I suspect seeing ghosts is related to your insomnia. Are you saying I see ghosts... ...because I'm sick? Doctors diagnose based on symptoms and science. Some people delude themselves into seeing ghosts, even in their dreams. The cause is different in each case. Some people may have a guilty conscience... ...or can't accept the death of loved ones. Some just want to brag. That's right. They make it up to scare people. Correct. But for schizophrenics... ...it's a different story. Inspector, think again. Is it possible that the people around you... ...don't exist? You're still here? You have to get a transfer here first. Copy. No need. Bee will go with me. Spare you the fright. "I deserve to die in front of Wendy Wong". Pong! Pong! What happened? What? You wanted to kill yourself! How did you get here? I was in a daze. I just came. I know. Wendy Wong tried to push you. What makes you think that? I honestly want to pay for my mistakes! So her ghost didn't come to you? Why did I keep thinking... ...that her ghost wanted to take revenge on you? So it's true... I'm sick? Many terrors and illusions... ...are man-made. People say Yau Oi Estate is haunted by spirits. Does this place look haunted? Nagi Yor-yee. Are you planning to jump again? You're causing trouble for my colleagues... ...and the residents here. Be honest... What do you want from me? I'll help you. Just don't come back Wait! You've got the wrong man. Inspector. We have 3 suspects... ...and 1 wounded hostage at the scene. Sir, my name is Bee. I want to apprentice under you. Not again! Jasmine!
