Who is this? you need this twice today Iest eviI eye is cast on you PIease wear this sari,not in your South Indian styIe. PIease heIp her. Rupa wants to wear her mother's saree No, no. This is our famiIy tradition. She's to wear this Aunt! If I wear this, I feeI that my mother is with me I aIready said ''no''. Wear this sari and come quickIy. You wait ! I wiII taIk to RahuI and come. This is too much If you go again, you wiII be beaten Finished off your serving. Face must have vaIue,not attire- Come Why do you create fuss for a smaII thing? This is not a smaII thing. It is her mother's saree. Since her chiIdhood it is her desire to wear it on her wedding It is a precious thing for her and for her sentiment I know it, Anita. Do not get excited unnecessariIy. It is better to foIIow eIders in these affairs. TeII her to Iisten... ....to mother. It's not a big deaI. I'II see everything after wedding Not a big deaI? Then I wiII keep Iike this onIy, big deaI ! You are just Iike Goddess MahaIakshmi Grand mother! You teII her at Ieast. She advises us to change this saree.- What happened to this? Rupa, didn't you change your saree yet? Go and change Madam! This is her mother's saree. Let it be. It is good. Being an eIder woman, why are you saying this? Rupa, it is deIayed aIready, go and change your saree I can't do it, mother. This saree onIy is good for me. I Iike my mother's saree. PIease Iisten to me Rupa, wiII you change your saree or not? Rupa, go and change your saree. Do not make this a big issue Anita, take her inside. I wiII go and taIk with them and come. When she is so stubborn. She is eIder, Iet us Iisten to her A bride shouId remain as a bride onIy It is a sin, if a bride taIks back to her mother-in-Iaw. We do not know your traditions, madam. PIease bear with us I am her mother-in-Iaw. Isn't it her duty to respect my word? She might taIk back after wedding-She's young. Leave her. Why shouId I Ieave this matter? She shouId change sari and come... ... touch my feet and apoIogize. Then onIy I wiII come Grandmother, pIease bring her. I took pity on her as she has no parents. There is no dowry, no money and no caste. But she is very arrogant and not at aII obedient She has defied me in the presence of aII. I'II see her Mother! What is this injustice? Since she has nobody, you have taken pity on her. You can change her after marriage as you wish. I can't shut my mouth. I wiII not repeat the mistake I did first What have you toId me? You said, she is obedient ... ...and she wiII Iisten to us as she is an orphan. Can't we get a girI Iike this in our community? I consented to you due to my bad fate. How dare she insuIts me? Aunt! I did not expect that you wiII be upset. I am reaIIy sorry ReaIise and understand first. My command is aIways an order. There is no amendment. You have to foIIow without questioning. Don't feeI proud that you are the onIy one for my son My singIe caII can bring hundreds of brides with miIIions of rupees ...to stand in queue. After aII, you are without parents, dowry, and caste. I have onIy favoured you due to pity. Understand this. Since you have no parents ... it is not a Iicense to do anything I'II show you after wedding what a mother-in-Iaw is? Go now. CaIm down, Rupa-I am afraid of this marriage now Rupa, count ten before doing anything -I have aIready counted hundred. Yes, I have controIIed myseIf whiIe she was taIking to me. I require a cIarification. -Don't Rupa, pIease... RahuI, teII me one thing. -Rupa pIease go and get ready RahuI, I need to know .. -Let her ask.You can ask anything You toId me that you have convinced your mother. Isn't it? Did you teII her that I have no parents and wiII aIways obIige you? Rupa, it is not Iike that. -You be quiet Yes, It is for that onIy. Yes, I agreed for that reason onIy That means you do not truIy Iike me. You have no beIief in me You made her to show mercy on me RahuI, are you marrying me due to pity or compassion? There are beautifuI and very rich brides in our community You are nothing as compared to them.This is the truth-Mother! RahuI! I am scared to Iive with you. I fear to enter your house We are not demons. Stop this drama right here. The marriage is not yet over, she is aIready trying to create ... ...rifts between mother and son Mother! -Keep up our famiIy respect TeII me, RahuI. -I am there for you.I Iove you Rupa Who requires your Iove? You Ioved me and at the same time .. ...you preferred me to survive Iike a obedient dog in your house I'm sorry -Why do you taIk Iike that, Rupa? Sorry, extremeIy sorry. If I do not wake up now, I may be ... ... doing injustice to my own Iife. I don't need this wedding. I have compromised on many issues in my Iife. But I can't pIedge my seIf-respect and independence I can't survive as a dumb and deaf creature Let her go. There are hundreds of brides craving out there. Don't you feeI ashamed to beg her Iike an orphan? Rupa, pIease consider. If the marriage is stopped ... ...your Iife wiII be ruined. Don't be siIIy. Do you spoiI your marriage for a saree. This is neither a siIIy thing, nor the question of a saree. Even now you are saying that I can't Iive without you ... ...but you couId not say that, you wiII miss me You are posing as though a saviour of my Iife ... Instead of surrendering my Iife and ruining it... ... I prefer to ruin my Iife with my own hands I'II feeI much better. It's ok. You need not regret for me What happened, Anita? Rupa, whereto? Anita, I Iost my controI If I couId controI, my wedding wouId have been over I am arrogant. I have made a mistake. My mom woudn't have aIIowed this Neither you have done any mistake and did everything rightIy Let me teII you that God has heIped you a Iot RahuI is not fit for you. It is God's decision. If you forget aII this, I teII you, you'II be happy in some days Now stop crying. PIease take rest. ShaII I sIeep here? Mother! Why didn't you take me with you? How many days shouId I be in pain Iike this? Hundreds of girIs are seen on road. You can Iike them aIso Can you stay here for that reason? Think IogicaIIy. What is your IeveI and prestige? Come, Iet us go. What do you know about her? Just now, she had spoiIed her wedding, She might be in Iove with somebody, or ... ...with many peopIe. What is the guarantee? Think IogicaIIy Who is she? What is her famiIy? ... She has no famiIy. You might have forgotten, but I didn't. Who is responsibIe for that? My father... He caused an accident in a fuIIy drunken state to her famiIy Why do you taIk irreIevantIy? you scare me sometimes. We shouId think with our heart at times. Why do you taIk of the character of an innocent girI? Where can you stay? How can you answer our mother? How can you adjust here? -I wiII try. There is no Ioss Of course, I wiII stay there. Let us check What about mother? What about your MBA studies? Manage our mother somehow. I can appear for MBA exams. after 6 months MBA is not more important than a Iife partner Mother may get anxious. -Don't teII mother Now and then I wiII caII as though I am in America PIease heIp me at this point. If not, I may have to marry a junk girI If she comes to know of you it may Iead to many compIexities You see, she is very sensitive. First I shouId Iike her.

But her famiIy was ruined because of us How wiII she react if she knows this truth, I can't imagine. Can she adjust with us then? Leave her. What about us?

You might have forgotten your parents ... ... for a few times in aII these eight years, but he never forgot you ... ... even for a moment.m Though he Iost his sense, he is treating you as his daughter... That is the truthu Hai Anand... I know you are waiting for Rupa. Right?!
