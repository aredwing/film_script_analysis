BASED ON A TRUE STORY - Dad is looking so well. - He is, isn't he? He always was a fighter. - Look at Mahtob. - She's such a daddy's girl. Well, so were you. Moody, Mahtob, Dad! Come on. Fresh, home-made lemonade. Come on, everybody. Mom, Daddy's teaching me how to fish again. - Can I see today's catch? - One of these days, oh ye of little faith. - Here you go. Dad, d'you want lemonade? - Yes. OK. - Ah. - Sour? - A little. - Not enough sugar? I never get that right. Hey, Mahtob. What vitamins do we get from lemons? - What vitamins do we get from lemons? - Vitamin C. Yes. What vitamins do we get from bananas? - Vitamin C, vitamin B and fibre. - Right! - None of my kids was as smart as that. - Great. Thanks, Mom - And what are you gonna be? - A nurse. - You can be a doctor as well. - A doctor and a nurse. How do you teach Mahtob to fish when you've never caught one? Honey, it's the best way. This way I'm totally unprejudiced. He bought all this fishing equipment and he's had her out there every day. If it's a choice between your lemonade and my fishing, I know where I stand. - I wanna sit on Daddy's lap. - Well, it's my turn. - Don't fight over me, girls. - You should find another lap. And then we have... Thank you. .. a 30-year-old woman with a Class 3 Pap smear for a TAH, so I think... The Iranians have prayed themselves back into the Stone Age. Why would anybody come to the States to study medicine? You can get a degree in Iran in two weeks. Seven days. The Ayatollah's got some great ideas. A soldier gets wounded, let him die. He's gonna go to paradise anyway. - See that newspaper? - The Iranian funny page? How can he read that thing? Looks like one of my prescriptions! I've read that prescription. - No, no, don't turn it off. - It's OK. - Honey, what's wrong? - Nothing's wrong. I'm fine. What's wrong? The family - is everything all right? Everybody's fine. They're fine. By the way, Mammal phoned. He and Nasserine have had a baby boy. That's great. A couple of doctors were making cracks again. - Who were they? - What does it matter? It matters, Moody. It matters. We moved here to get away from all that. - God, it's just so awful! - Oh, honey, forget it. Honey, forget it. There are dumb people everywhere. Forget it. "And the genie roared with laughter. Ha ha ha!" "O thou poor thief of a thousand alleyways. " "You think you can marry the Sultan's daughter when all the princes in Persia are seeking her hand?" "You foolish slave, replied Aladdin boldly. " "Have you forgotten the precious jewels in the cave?" "You have the wits of a donkey. " "I should put you back into the dirty old lamp. " - Is there really Aladdin's cave? - There must be. - Can we find it? - I'm not sure if I know where it is, but... You know, I was born in Persia. They call it Iran now. If I took you there, maybe we could look for it together. Iran's got caves and mountains and deserts, just like in the story. And mosques that are so beautiful they're like jewels. When the sun shines on them they dazzle your eyes. Would you like to see those? OK. Where were we? - Daddy? - Uh-huh? Do I hate Americans? Of course not. Lucille says I hate Americans because you're from Iran. Sweetheart... Lucille doesn't really know what she's talking about. So we shouldn't pay too much attention to her. I've lived in America for 20 years. I'm as American as apple pie. And so are you. Give me a kiss. Big hugs. Mmm. Big hugs. That was Ameh Bozorg. It's always the same. She cries and cries on the phone. "You're like a son to me. When your mother died, I raised you. " "I'm sick. You're not here to look after me. " - Is she sick? - No, no, she's not sick. She's 58. She feels old, but she's not sick. - Same old guilt trip. - Oh, honey, come on. She's your sister. Phone her more often. Phoning's no good. She wants to see me. Now Mammal and Nasserine have had the baby, everybody's there except me. It's been ten years. I haven't seen my family for ten years. Mammal and Reza have been here. Why doesn't she come? She's hardly been out of Tehran. She wants to see me over there. They want to see us. They've never met you or Mahtob. - She asks why we can't go for a vacation. - You'll have to explain it to them. - Explain what? - We can't go to Iran. Why not? I'm not taking Mahtob to Iran. It's much too violent. We're not going to go sightseeing to the Persian Gulf. We're going to spend two weeks with my family. Moody, there's too much going on over there. Look, your family is welcome here any time. You know that. Maybe you should just go there yourself. No. I don't mean that either. None of us should go. It's not safe. - Mommy! - I'm coming! You're getting it out of proportion. I haven't seen any of them for ten years. - Honey, I... - Mommy! All right! I'm coming! No, it's OK. Go ahead. Honey, I want to go more than anything. I miss them so much. You're always talking about how important family is. All I want to do is go for two weeks with you and Mahtob and visit my family. - Moody, it scares me. - What scares you, honey? Look at me. Do you honestly think that I would take you and Mahtob anywhere dangerous? I love you both more than anything in the whole world. Listen. Mahtob's got a vacation. She starts a new school. It's a good time. I swear to you... on the sacred Koran that you won't be in any danger, that we'll be back after two weeks and that I wouldn't do anything to jeopardise yours or Mahtob's safety. Come on, honey. It's not such a big deal. Look what they're doing. - Hello, Betty. - Hello, Nasserine. It's so good to see you. This is Mahtob. - Betty! Betty! This is Ameh Bozorg! - Sweetheart, that's Daddy's sister. - Oh, my goodness. Look. Mahtob. - Mahtob! Moonlight. You are moonlight. I know. Mahtob means "moonlight". Mahtob. Betty? I'm so happy. Now you can be with us. Yes. It's only for two weeks but I'm very pleased. I remember your house in America very well. - Mammal, it's so good to see you. - Finally you're here, Betty. Yes. I'm so glad we could come for a visit. Congratulations on the baby. Thank you. - What? - Nothing. She says Mahtob looks almost exact to Moody and to Ameh Bozorg. - Some reception, huh? - Oh, my gosh. It's amazing. - You know all these people? - All of them. Oh, boy. This is all my family. - Obviously they really missed you. - The car's just over here. Go ahead. Unwrap it. It's a gift. Thank you. Isn't that nice? Oh, thank you. Thank you. - Go on, put it on. - Now? Yeah. It's, er... They've gone to a lot of trouble. It'll make them happy. - All right. - It's pretty good quality. Let's get in the car. God... it all looks so different. You said foreign women don't have to wear Islamic dress. Yeah, I know. I made a mistake. It's all changed. Anyway, it's only when you leave the house or when you go outside. You saw the women. I didn't recognise half my family. They were all covered. Last time only half of them wore chadors. It's all new. - What would happen if I didn't wear this? - Ameh Bozorg? She says you'd get arrested. - I have to go to the bathroom. - Wait. We're almost there. Hi. No! They're hurting him, Mommy! They're hurting him! They're hurting him, Mommy! It's a way of saying welcome. They give the meat to the poor. Honey, we have to step over it. It's expected. Just hang on to me. Mahtob... It's the Friday prayer. From Tehran University. Mahmood... Prayers. Don't forget we've got to get some things for your mom and dad. Thank you, honey. Let me do you. All right? Fix your scarf! Fix your hair! Cover your hair! They didn't know you were foreign. They wouldn't have been so harsh. - It was a little bit of hair. - You gotta be careful. They're very strict. You must cover all. You must not be careless! Every hair that is not covered is like a dagger aimed at the heart of our martyrs! Come on. Just give it time, sweetheart. It's OK. Look at these hands. Sshh! - Mom... - Sshh! I guess that means we can eat. Come on, sit up straight. Is it because I didn't wear a chador? Honey, you misinterpreted. She wasn't looking at you. You didn't see. She looked at me... It was the same feeling today when the police stopped me. It was with such dislike. It just seems so primitive sometimes. All religious beliefs seem primitive when they're not your own. But to cover them up and hide them away? - Are they afraid of women's sexuality? - No, that's not the reason. Iranian women like to wear the chador. It's a mark of respect. When the Shah tried to ban them they had demonstrations in the streets. Most women wanted to bring it back. Sorry. I know it's a different culture. I guess I... just don't understand it. Why is Mammal angry at you, and the others? They seem to be going at you all the time. My family... they're very religious. They're not sophisticated. They're basically country people. It's all changed so much. It's all back to the Koran. It's been that way since the Revolution. When they moved into this house, they got rid of all the furniture - all of it. Now they see me and... I seem so Americanised. And you have an American wife. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. The last thing I wanted was to insult them... I know. Honey, it's going to seem strange for a while, but, believe me, they want to love you. They will. I promise. OK. - What? - Nothing. - Nothing. - What's so funny? You know they think we make love all the time? - Who? - The family. Why? After they make love they have to take a shower. They can't pray unless they do. It's considered unclean. We're taking two or three showers a day! Oh, God! What, they think we're two rabbits? I'm not taking another shower. You knew the whole time! - I didn't know you were such a swinger! - You knew that all along! - You were out in the hall giggling! - Don't get mad. - Don't go. - I have to. - Please stay. - I can't. You've been getting up early every morning. Don't go. What's the matter with you? We're with my family. They're Sayyeds - direct descendants of Mohammed. Of course, to a sophisticated American that must seem primitive. - Betty? - Oh, God, you scared me. I wondered where you were. - I got the most beautiful picture. - Light's gone. Coming in? Yeah. - Betty? - What? Something happened before we came out here. What? I didn't want to tell you about it. We were coming out here, so... Moody, what happened? I got fired from the hospital. You got fired? It happened just before we left. Literally, two days. I can't believe it. They can't do that. Yes, they can. If they can find someone who can do the job for less money. Oh, no. And who isn't an Iranian. Oh... Moody, I can't believe that. - Your work was going so well. - You think they like Iranians in Michigan? It's always there... just under the surface. Not one of my colleagues has ever stood up for me whenever there was trouble. Honey, that's not true. We're talking about the medical profession. They're supposed to be an educated group of people. What are we gonna do? Well... I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna go home tomorrow and find out how this happened. We'll appeal. It's America. We've got laws. We've got friends. You've got lots of friends. And this just can't happen. Hey! Stop that. Look at you messing everything up. Get your own stuff together. - I don't think they'll let this through. - Maybe Mammal can ship it. Do you wanna pack Toby Bunny or carry him? It's gonna be hot. - Pack him. - OK. Sit down and fold up all those clothes you messed up. - Can I put them in the suitcase? - Yes. Sweetheart, you haven't packed. Do you want me to do it? No. You must take passport to the airport three days before to get approval. - Approval? What approval? - You must get stamp. - You cannot leave today. - When's the next flight? I don't know. - Moody, what is this? - I don't know. We'll have to wait for the next available flight, I guess. How could you not take care of the passports? - Didn't somebody tell you about this? - Nobody thought about it. We'll go to the airport and tell them we didn't know about it. Maybe they'll let us through. If not, we'll sit and wait for the next flight. I don't know how to say this to you. We're not going back. We're staying here. What do you mean? How long? I want to get a job here. In a hospital. - What? - I want us to live in Iran. No. No. - There's nothing for me in America. - No. Are you crazy? We're Americans. Your daughter's an American. Moody, honey, you're upset about your job. I understand that. We're gonna fix it. - I want Mahtob to grow up here. - No! - I think she should become a Muslim. - No! No. You lied to me. You lied to me. You held the Koran and swore nothing was gonna happen. - Mommy. - You were planning this all the time. - Aren't we going home today? - Yes, we are. - Go downstairs and say goodbye. - All right. Moody, I know what's been going on. They've got no right. You've got to resist it. I know how much you miss your family, how guilty they make you feel. I know the pressure they're putting on you. I promise we'll come back. We'll spend time here. But we can't stay here. This is a backward, primitive country. I won't live here or bring up my daughter here. How can you consider raising Mahtob here with how they treat women? - I know it's the right decision. - No. - For all of us. For you and for Mahtob. - You can't mean this. I'm a doctor. They're desperate for doctors. I could do a lot of good here. - Please... - Besides, I'm a Muslim. - This is where I should be. - Don't do this. I know it seems harsh, but it's the best thing for all of us. - Mahtob could learn real values here. - No! I won't stay here. You can't... You listen to me. You're in my country now. You're my wife. You do as I say. You understand me? We're staying here. Mammal, would you translate for me? Please excuse me if I don't get my words straight. I'm a bit shaken up. I wanted to talk to you to see if you could understand my feelings. Moody and I have been married for seven years. We have loved each other very much and trusted each other. Trust was always very important. I didn't want to come here. Moody knew that. I made it very clear to him. The only reason I came was to visit with you so you could meet our daughter. But I was frightened. So Moody swore to me on the holy Koran that nothing like this could happen. He held the Koran and he swore to me. Isn't that true, Moody? I had to. You wouldn't have come with me if I hadn't. Baba Hajji, you're a religious man. How can Moody swear on the Koran and then do this to me? Allah will forgive him. No! No! Ameh Bozorg, Ameh Bozorg, please help me! Please! No, you can't do this. Damn you! Damn you! You can't keep me here! You had this planned all along! Damn you! I'll be with you. I'll help you. You try to go to sleep. Where are the cheque-books and credit cards? And I'll need the house keys and the keys to the car. They're in the small bag, I think. Moody? - Talk to me. Please! - There's nothing more to say. Oh, Moody, please. Please talk to me. Mahmood... I told you to stop calling here. No, she's not available. She's also my wife, which means she wants to do what I want. You're not helping him by doing this. Yes, I know and I'm very sorry, but this isn't gonna help his illness, so please leave us alone. No, I will not discuss... I really don't care about that. The State Department can do what the hell it likes! Betty, you've got to eat. You can't keep this up. You're gonna make yourself sick. If I thought you really wanted to stay here, we could have such a great life. You know... when I first heard the Shah was leaving Iran... it was just after Mahtob was born. I couldn't believe it. It was just amazing. They had everyone on the streets. Millions of people. I should have been here. For the first time, we could say to everyone, "This is our faith. This is our way of life. This is who we are. " And nothing could stop us. You can't imagine what that was like. I know things have been hard for you, but they'll get better. I promise you. - Dear Lord, hear our prayer. - Dear Lord, hear our prayer. Please help us leave Iran and get back to America. Please help us leave Iran and get back to America. Please let nothing separate us. Please let nothing separate us. And keep us always safe in your care. And keep us always safe in your care. - Amen. - Amen. - Hello. - Hello, Betty. - Mom? Oh, God! - Don't talk. Just listen. You are to go to the 'American Interests section of the Swiss Embassy. There is no US Embassy in Tehran any more. It's on Khiaban Fereshteh Street. Their number is 625475. - 625475... - What are you doing? It was ringing. I answered it. Why do you wanna humiliate me? You don't touch the phone or leave the house. - Do you understand? - Yes! Swiss Embassy. American Interests section. I can't hear. You'll have to talk louder. - I can't talk louder. - I can't hear you, caller. 'Are you there, caller?. 'Are you there, caller?. Please help me. I'm being held hostage. You'll have to talk louder. You're very faint. I'm being held hostage. Please help me. I'm sorry. I can't hear you, caller. Who were you talking to? - When? - On the phone. - No one. - Don't lie to me! - Stop it, Daddy! - It's OK. It's between Mommy and me. It was nothing. I tried to call Nasserine. I got the wrong number. What do you think? You think you can lie to me? You think you can do anything without me knowing about it? My family tell me everything. They're watching you all the time, so don't be stupid. Mommy isn't stupid. She's gonna have to start school soon. We'll have to get her the right clothes. - I don't wanna go to school. - What school? When? American Interests... The Swiss Embassy. Khiaban Fereshteh is the name of the street. Khiaban Fereshteh. Swiss Embassy. My name is Betty Mahmoody. I'm an American citizen. Show your passport inside. - Thank you. - Passport. We don't have our passports. My husband has them. We're American citizens. - You can go. - Mommy, we can go home! My name is Nicole Adjanian. Betty Mahmoody. This is my daughter, Mahtob. - Please sit. - Thank you. We're so glad to see you. I spoke with my mother in the United States. I know the State Department is into this. We're just very happy to be here. We'll sleep anywhere. For as long as it takes, until you can get us out. What are you talking about? You cannot stay here. I can't go back to my husband. I wanna go home to the United States. That may be, but you are in Iran. - You are married to an Iranian? - Yes. - Then you are an Iranian citizen. - No. I'm not. I'm an American citizen and my daughter's an American citizen. We were born in the United States. We have American passports. I mean, we don't have them with us. My husband has them. We've never changed our citizenship. If you marry an Iranian man, you automatically become an Iranian citizen. The laws regarding women are very strict. You cannot travel anywhere without written permission. You have no rights to the children. They go to the man in a divorce. I'm sorry, but you have to go back to your husband. But we'll never get out of Iran. We're being held hostage. It was almost impossible to come here. Mrs Mahmoody, there are many American women here in similar circumstances. May I ask you why you came to Iran? I don't know. I don't know. I was afraid to come. I wanted to please him. I trusted him. I was frightened but I never thought this would happen. I thought of him as an American. He's changed. Oh, God, he's changed. Look, Mrs Mahmoody... Many came back after the Revolution feeling guilty about being away, about turning their backs on Iran and on Islam. Now Iran is an Islamic state and that's a wonderful thing for many Iranians. Well, if there is anything I can do... Maybe if you need to organise telephone calls to the US or if you want to write letters home, let me know. So if Daddy asks, we went for a walk and got lost. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! - Where were you? - I went for a walk! - Huh? Where were you? - We went for a walk! Shut up! You try anything like this again, I'll kill you. Oh, my God. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Mahtob Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Mahtob Happy birthday to you Hi. Hi. Nasserine said you wanted to see me. I can't believe she's five, can you? No. Thank you for today. The doll and everything. I miss her. Seems I haven't spent much time with her lately. Moody... I wanna make it work. You were such a wonderful father today. It brought it all back. Honey, I want you to be happy. I want to make you happy. I need you to help me. Oh, Betty. I didn't want it to be like this. I love you. I never wanna hurt you. Oh, Moody. Moody, I need you to help me. We can't stay in this house. It's my sister's house. She'd be insulted if we went away. No. She doesn't want us here. She doesn't like me. We got nowhere else to go. We could stay with Mammal and Nasserine. We helped them when they were in the States. Nasserine goes to classes. I could babysit. I could help. Please. Oh, Betty. I don't wanna lose you. I want you to tell me anything I can ever do. - The kitchen? - Kitchen. I'll cook for you. I'm so grateful, Nasserine. Thank you so much. I was telling them the same rules apply as before. You have to wear a chador tonight. Oh? My uncle's a mullah. He's highly respected. He's a very influential man. He's written books on Islam. Maybe he's gonna help me get a job. Betty, you are very good Iranian cook. - Thank you. - You are lucky people. Why you wear chador? - I thought I had to. - But why? Chador is Persian tradition. It's not necessary to wear it inside. It is exaggerated with some people now. Mahmood told me you read Koran. Yes. I try. - I like to. - Very good. - You go to Koran class? - No. Mahmood must send you there. They are in English language. - Would you like? - Yes. Very much. The Hadiths or reports are the collected sayings of the Prophet with additional commentaries by devout and learned men. In our readings from the Koran, we'll consider the Hadiths when appropriate. - What page are we on? - I don't know. She just... - You're American. - Yes. .. without there being on it an imam guiding the people to God. - We lived there! - You're kidding? - Chicago. - But I lived in Michigan. - Where? - Near Lancing. - Where? - It's a little place. Owosso. I lived there for five years! I went to grammar school there. - My husband had his own practice there. - My husband's a doctor too. I can't believe this! Now I work for an English language magazine for Islamic women. - Have you become Muslim? - Mm-hm. - Did you convert? - Well, I wanted to, I guess. My husband was happy I did. It made things a lot better. Er... I gotta go. - Ellen, it's been... - No, really. Moody. I just met an American woman in class. From Owosso. Her husband's a doctor. - Are they here? - They just left. She's invited us over. Is that all right? Yeah, that's fine. I want you to ask questions when you're out with your daddy. I want you to ask him questions about taxis and buses. - And how much things cost. - OK. All right? Ask him questions about signs. What the signs mean, what they say. - All right. - Then you can teach me. Why do you wanna learn all that? I have to if we're gonna get out of here. - What's that? - His name on the sign. - What's he sell? - All kinds of things they sell here. These are pictures of people who died in the war. - Why all these questions, honey? - What's that? - That's the rest of the market and... - What do they do? Telephone. Telephone. The moment the Shah left I wanted to go back to Iran, but Ellen didn't want to. So I said, "Fine. I'll go without you. " So she came. The first year in Iran things were very bad between us. She couldn't adjust. Could you, Ellen? It took quite a time before she understood how to be a good wife. Warm, isn't it? Yes. Why did you come back? I mean, my God, he let you go home to the States... and you came back. Maybe at the beginning if... Of course there was the custody problem with the kids, so... It was tough for me. I had no experience. A small American town. - Was he violent? - Not in the States, never. You're not supposed to. It's not Islamic. Marriages do work out here. They can be good. It's been hard for me at times, but you've got to give it time, Betty. Islam has such beauty in it. I mean, I'm glad my kids are growing up as Muslims. Ellen... I'm so happy we're friends. When you told me you were from home, I was thrilled. It was like a miracle. Ellen... I have something I want to tell you. If I do, can you keep it a secret? Not tell your husband? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ellen, I'm sorry. Please forget I spoke. No, it's OK. Go ahead. I won't tell him. That's a promise. Would you take this letter for me? I'm trying to get back home to America. My family is working on it, but Moody knows where I am every minute. Are you crazy? Don't you realise what can happen? Terrible things. You just can't, Betty. If you were caught, they could execute you. It's for the Embassy. Please. Can you believe that? They're desperate for doctors, they've got casualties from the war, but because I trained in America, no one will give me a job. It's not the reason. Hard to believe this country was getting sophisticated before the Revolution. We were building chemical plants, oil refineries, multi-million dollar installations. They're all rotting because nobody knows how to operate them! It's all so primitive! Honey, somebody needs to go to the market. We're out of meat and things. - I can't go. - It's for tonight's dinner. I can't go. You'll have to wait till Nasserine gets back. She's late. What'll we do tonight? I don't know! Can't you go by yourself for a change? Yeah. I can, really. I know the way. It's not far. I'll take the children. You give me a list of everything you need and I'll tell you what time for you to be back here. Take the baby with you. Mahtob can stay here with me. - You are American? - Yes. I need dozaari for the telephone. I was in America many times. New York. Amarillo, Texas. You want to telephone? Please. Come. Please. Thank you. American Interests section. Nicole Adjanian. Nicole, it's Betty. Have you heard anything from the State Department? No, I can't. Because he watches me all the time or he has somebody watch me. I didn't know that. Will they let us go if I get a divorce? What? I can't do that... I can't do that. I won't leave her. Nicole... Nicole, I won't leave her! All right. I'll get to the Embassy if I can. Thank you. You're very kind. You can use the telephone when you want. No problem. - Thank you. - I like America very much. My son was with University of Texas. That is my son. He is a martyr for the war. My name is Hamid. Any time for telephone, you come here. I'm Betty. - Who'll take me to school tomorrow? - I don't know, honey. It'll either be me or it'll be Daddy. - But I want you to. - I don't know if I can, Mahtob. Why can't you? Honey... I promise you I'll be there and everything will be all right. OK? Come on. - Dear Lord. - Dear Lord. - Hear our prayer. - Hear our prayer. - We beg you to help us leave Iran. - We beg you to help us leave Iran. - And get back to America. - And get back to America. I'll be back this afternoon, sweetheart. I'll be back. I'll be back, sweetheart. Sweetheart, I'll be back. I'll be here, sweetheart. - I don't wanna go! Daddy, please! - Don't worry, baby. Mommy, please! Mommy, don't leave me! Don't leave me! Nasserine, take the baby. I'll get the rice. Hamid. I can't stay. You must come inside. There is someone here. Miss Nassimi. She came to help you. Hamid told me you wished to leave Iran. You know it is extremely dangerous. I have to get back to the United States. - Why don't you try to get a divorce? - No. If I get a divorce, my husband will get custody of my daughter. If they catch you with your daughter, they could execute you. - I can't leave her. I have to... - Please. Wait. I think we can help you. My brother has helped many people here. I will be here Wednesday and Thursday at this time if you can come. Here is my telephone number. Memorise it, please. Don't keep it. Thank you. Betty! I got the rice. Sorry. What happened? She was crying all day again. I had to go pick her up. We can't make her do this, Moody. She's frightened. I know. Tomorrow they want you to go to school with her. OK. They want you to stay with her every day. Of course. Of course I'll stay with her. They're all devout women there. You'll be watched. OK. I just want Mahtob to be happy. I want her to have a happy childhood. Don't you want that? Islam's the greatest gift I can give my child. You said there'd be no danger. Mahtob could have been killed! America's doing this. Who supplies the bombs, the planes? Who's backing Iraq? Don't be so naive. America's responsible for this war, no one else! You should not behave this way. I had to tell Hormoz. It is your duty as a wife to tell your husband everything! You cannot have secrets! Very nice. Very nice. Mahtob... very nice. Very nice. I am very sorry... It's bad in Iran. Bad for you... your husband. I'm sorry. We help you. We help you. Help you. - Could I use the telephone? - Telephone? Nah! Nah. Husband, no telephone. You inside. You inside. Right. You come after morning. Eleven. - After morning. - I can come late with Mahtob? Thank you. There are three principal ways out of Iran. You could go to Baluchistan and then across the mountains into Pakistan. In the south-west to Bandar Abbas, then across the Gulf by boat to Oman. This is the most dangerous route. From Tehran, across the Zagros Mountains, through Kurdistan into Turkey. There are checkpoints and the border's heavily armed. - Which way do you think is best? - The Gulf. How much will it cost? When you and your daughter are back in America, perhaps you will reimburse me. Dollars would be of more help to me than Iranian currency. Keep in touch with my sister. Right. Run! Run! - Where were you? - Stop it, Daddy! Where have you been?! Mommy! - Mommy! - Get up! Get up! I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna cut you up! You're gonna be dead! Get out. Betty! Betty! Nicole Adjanian. Nicole Adjanian. Nicole? He's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill me. He said he was gonna kill me. She is from the Embassy. I need to take Mahtob. Nah, nah! Impossible. Child goes to father. He's going to kill me. I have to get my daughter. Madam, you wait, husband come. - I want my baby! - Madam! Madam! I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! Betty, they won't let you take her. The State Department want you to go to the Iranian Foreign Minister. No! The State Department don't understand the culture. They'll only make things worse! - You wait for your husband. - Tell her I want my baby. I want my baby! I cannot. Please, please... Listen, honey, don't talk right now. Because I have to tell you you can't talk about Hamid or the Embassy because if you do, they'll never let us get away. Don't say anything. Do you hear me? Mommy, don't leave me. Don't go away. I promise you. I promise I won't leave you. Do you hear? I won't leave you. - Where are Mammal and Nasserine? - You, don't ask questions. Is that enough for you, sweetheart? They've moved in with Ameh Bozorg. - Moody, what are you doing? - Mommy! Please don't take her! Moody! Moody! Please! Please don't take her! Moody, please don't take her! Moody! Moody, please! Moody! Moody! Moody! Moody, don't take her! Don't take her! Does Mommy take you on adventures? Come on, where does she take you? To Koran class. We saw some camels. Yeah? You go anywhere else? How come you were late for school yesterday? - We got lost. - No, you didn't! I know you didn't! - We did! - Where the hell where you?! - Where were you?! - We got lost! - Where were you?! - We got lost! Moody? Moody, please don't leave. How's Mahtob? Please! Please don't leave. Is she all right? Mahtob. Mahtob. Betty? Betty? Mahtob. Mahtob. You brought her back to me. Thank you. Thank you. My baby. Thank you, Moody. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Mahtob Happy birthday to you - Will you be all right? - Yes, but when will you be back? - I'll be back as soon as I can. Be brave. - I will. We will fly you to Bandar Abbas and then take you by speedboat across the Gulf. I'll never be able to thank you. Please, Betty. There's really no need. Just make the journey safely. I wish you could have seen this in the summer. All the flowers have gone now, of course. Gardens have always had a special place in Persia. Throughout our history. In fact, the word "paradise" is a Persian word. It's hard to believe that the idea of paradise will always be intimately connected with Iran. Whenever I think of what's happening to my country, I try to remember its gardens. You must try and phone me now whenever you can. By Christmas you'll be home. Betty. Merry Christmas. I'm sorry. The Gulf got too dangerous. Warships are checking all the civilian boats. Zahedan is safer, so I've booked a flight for you and Mahtob on Wednesday 29th January, ten days from now. Wednesday. Good. Moody's at the hospital on Wednesdays. On the 29th, take Mahtob to the school bus as usual. We will pick you both up from the bus stop, take you to a safe house until it's time to go. Was he in pain? Is he now? How much? How long has he known? - So he's not responding to the treatment? - What is it? - And they offered that? - What? Mother, would you hold on for a moment? It's my father. He's not doing well. They feel they should operate and... Tell her you'll go to America to see him. Tell her you're going. Go on. Tell her you're going to see him. Tell her now. Mom? Moody says we can come home. - I'm sorry about your father. - Thank you. Will you be able to come home with us? No, I can't go. I'd lose my job at the hospital. - But it's all right for Mahtob to come? - No. You'll have to go on your own. - I can't go without Mahtob. - Why not? You'll see your father. What's the problem? I won't go without her. Betty... You'll leave as soon as possible. You'll see your father and liquidate all our assets in the States. It's my money and I want it! Don't do it, Betty. You'll never see your daughter again. - He won't allow you back in the country. - My father is dying. I don't think he'd want you to if it meant losing your daughter. Why can't I go now, come back and later try to get out? You can't leave Mahtob here, not with Moody's family. They're from the provinces, more fanatical than most. This regime encourages them. Some people here consider a girl ready for marriage at nine years of age. Child brides are not unknown. If you want to be free, with Mahtob, you've got to leave on the 29th as we agreed. But he may send me out before, maybe tomorrow. He hasn't said. For the war. They take them younger and younger. They give them plastic keys to paradise, made in Taiwan, and tell them they'll go straight to heaven if they die. They use them sometimes to clear minefields. They run across the field and get blown to pieces. OK. We've only a week to go. He's got to get your passport validated. He can't do it in the time. It's impossible. He trusts you now. Try and do anything you can to delay him. - Where were you? - Moody. I went to the market. I wanted to buy my father some gifts but I couldn't find anything. The one day I come home early. I've let you go. I've given you freedom. OK. Listen to me. If you don't do as I say, I'll lock you up and you'll never see Mahtob again. On the 26th you get on that plane to America. You send everything back here and then you return. In the meantime, do not touch the phone or set foot out of the house. Is that clear? Yes. Moody? - You booked for the 26th? - What do you mean? Of course I booked. You got the validation? Remember last time? Zia knows people. It's all been done. I hope your father gets well. I'm sorry we can't see you off tomorrow. Please come back to us. We love you. They want me to go back to the hospital. I gotta go. I have to go to the market. There's a few things that I need. It'll take me about 20 minutes. - I'll go. - No, no. It's all right. I need some fresh air. I'd like to buy some gifts for my father. There's been no time. Honey? Mahtob, get your scarf and your jacket. Houssein. Houssein. Houssein, I have her with me. This is the last chance I have. We have to leave now. Betty. Come. My brother wants you to call your husband and delay him. First I must call Houssein and tell him you're safe. - I forgot Toby Bunny. - What? I forgot Toby Bunny. Honey... Honey, do you want to go home to America? Mahtob, stop crying. Stop crying. Listen now. If we go back for Toby Bunny, we have to stay with Daddy. Do you want that? But when will I see my daddy again? I don't know. Stop crying now. I love you. I love you. You be my big, brave girl. All right. - Moody, I'm not gonna get on that plane. - Why not? What are you planning? Nothing. I'm not planning anything. - I'll call the police. - Go ahead and call the police. - There are things I'd like to tell them. - Like what? Like I know the clinic isn't legal. You don't have an operating permit. I found out. I sit there all day long. You think I wouldn't notice?! I'm only trying to be good to you. - Yes. - We don't need the police. I agree. That won't be necessary. So we can get together and talk about this, Betty. Betty? I'll have to think about it. You'd better. I don't believe a word you say any more. How could you take Mahtob away? You're stealing my child. No. I'm not gonna promise you anything, Betty. You're my wife. Get your ass back here! Hello, Betty. This is Zia. Zia. I want you to tell Moody that I have a lawyer. Tell Moody I won't meet with him alone. If he wants to talk with me, I'll be there between 11 and 12 tomorrow morning and six and eight tomorrow afternoon. You tell him that. We're ready. We must go. They'll find you if you stay any longer in Tehran. OK. Let me get my things. We've had no time to organise paperwork, so you may have difficulty in Turkey, but they won't send you back. Get to the US Embassy when you get to Ankara. We'll drive you to the Zagros Mountains. Tribesmen will take you across. They're Kurdish. Most are friendly. They know how to avoid the checkpoints. Do not let anybody know you're American. First you must be careful of the checkpoint outside Tehran. Betty... Very soon I hope you will be strolling again in your own garden at home. In America. Hurry. What? What are you doing? Oh, God, what are you doing? No. Please. Please. - Mommy? Mommy. Mommy, wake up! - No. - Mommy! - No, get off me! Get off me! Get off me! - Mommy. - No, it's OK. It's OK. Turkey! Turkey! We're home, baby. - We're home. - Mommy.
