Shortly thereafter, it was indicated | that this atomic reaction... according | to scientific reports... had originated in a remote area | in North Pacific waters... somewhere between the northern tip | of theJapanese islands... and the arctic circle. This is the story | of that explosion. Oh! Professor Montel. | I'm McCleary of the Herald Tribune. Oh, yes. | How do you do? I understand that you're going to Vienna | to address the, uh... Central European Federation | of Advanced Scientists. That is correct. I will read a paper on the emission of neutrons | and collision of nuclei. Thank you, | Professor. - Will any of the American Atomic Energy Commission be present? | - I doubt it. Will you excuse me, | gentlemen? Oui. Uh, Professor. Excuse me. | There's one or two points I'd like to get clarified. You will have to excuse me, gentlemen. | The plane is waiting. Who's the girl? This is the BBC with the latest news bulletin. Professor Montel, famous nuclear physicist | and atomic scientist... has vanished while en route to attend | a conference in Vienna. Professor Montel's disappearance | is a complete mystery to the police. Authoritative sources reveal today | that the former Nobel Prize winner... is the fifth noted scientist believed to have | vanished behind the iron curtain. Professor Montel was last seen | at the International Airport in Vienna. Speculation as to the whereabouts... of Professor Montel continues. Ten days have elapsed | since the distinguished scientist vanished... and so far police have been unable to offer | any explanation. Authorities are now convinced... that Professor Montel | was not kidnapped... and that his disappearance | was part of a prearranged plan. Airport officials in Vienna | reveal that the scientist... carried a diplomatic passport. The search for Professor Montel | continues into the fourth week. It is interesting to note that while | the story has been given front-page space... in newspapers in the United States | and all other parts of the free world... Pravda, the official mouthpiece | of the Soviet Union... has, as yet, failed | to take note on it. - Corporal Lee Stockwell? | - Right. - Mr. R.J. MacDougall? | - That's right. - Mr. Franklin Meredith. | - That's correct. Jones! I'm afraid you're mistaken. | My name's MacDougall. You're a dead ringer for an officer | I used to know in the submarine service. Sorry. Mr. MacDougall? Yeah. My name is Eddy. Your instructions. There is a taxi waiting for you. | The driver knows the address. Taxi number 63. Number 63. Okay. This is it. - You better wait for me. | - No, I go now. Wait a minute. What if I need you again? | Where can I find you? - What's your name? | - Eddy. Mr. MacDougall? - Yeah. | - Come in, please, and follow me. Watch your step, please. - Now don't tell me your name is Eddy too. | - "Eddy" is the password. I'm Hokada Fujimori, | CommanderJones. I'm very pleased | to meet you. Thanks. For a minute there, I thought this was | something out of Inner Sanctum. Ah, you've lost | a little weight. I'm on a diet. I'll bet Captain Taylor put a little fat on, huh? - Where is he? | - I'm sorry to tell you, your friend is dead. - Dead? | - His plane crashed returning from an arctic expedition. No one survived. He never did like to fly. Why did he want me to come here? | What was the 5,000 for? It's an advance payment for a job | Captain Taylor was certain you would do for us. - Advance? | - Yes. - When do I start? | - Without questions? Why talk? IfTaylor | lined me up for the job, it must be kosher. Some people might not | exactly call it kosher. In here, please. Gentlemen, | CommanderJones. - Mr. McAuliff. | - How do you do, sir? - Colonel Schuman. | - How are you? - Mr. Aylesworth. | - How do you do? And Professor Montel. - Montel, the scientist? | - Yes. Everybody and his brother | is gunning for you, Professor. They say you skipped | behind the iron curtain. As you can see, | only a wooden door. - Glad you're here. | - Thank you, sir. Well, it's quite a layout | you got here. What kind of business | are you gentlemen in? The business | of investigation. The scientific | investigation... of these uninhabited North Pacific islands | that lie in neutral waters... - between the free world and the iron curtain. | - Uh-huh. Our deductions make us believe | that one of these islands- we don't know which one, | Mr. Jones- has been prepared | as an arsenal for atomic weapons. Your friend | Captain Taylor volunteered... to undertake a photographic mission | to find out. - Volunteered? | - Yes. - For free? | - For free. Is that when he had | the accident? It was no accident. | His plane was shot down. This photograph | we have just printed... came from the camera | of his salvaged plane. Thirty years in the navy, | and he gets killed for a picture. For free. Each man has his own | reason for living, Mr. Jones... and his own price | for dying. This was | Captain Taylor's price. There's nothing there, Professor. | It's a washout. I wouldn't be too certain. | Extend these lines. They could be atomic vault | constructions. And over here could also be part | of a concrete runway. Look. Look, before | we go any further... exactly what country | do you men represent? We represent | many countries... as private individuals. We are scientists, | former statesmen, businessmen- all volunteers | acting independently... for a common cause | against a common enemy. As private | individuals... we can conduct this investigation | on a scientific basis... without violating | any neutral waters. And if what we suspect | is verified... we can then make | our findings public. And what good | will that do? Don't you think the truth | is worth knowing? Don't you believe that | factual proof will establish, once and for all... both the identity and the intention | of the aggressor? Who knows? | But where do I fit in to the picture? We want you to command a ship | for an inspection tour of these islands. - What kind of a ship? | - A submarine. We know that four times | during World War II... you commanded a submarine | reconnaissance patrol... in this very area. As I recall, you were | extremely successful in these waters... when you fought | my country. This time the enemy is different, Mr. Jones, | but the waters are the same. You received already | $5,000. 20,000 in United States | currency... will be deposited to your account | in any bank you elect... to chauffeur Professor Montel | to this island. And another 25,000 bonus | when you bring him back safely... with all the information | he seeks. What about the sub? | Did it volunteer too? One does not pick up a first-class submarine | in the junkyard, Mr. Jones. We have salvaged | a Japanese submarine. - What class? | - I-203. Sewer pipe. Had one on my tail once | for six hours. Taylor look her over? - Yes. | - Start getting her refitted? - Yes. | - Armed? Mr. Jones, the object | of this mission... is scientific investigation, | not combat. Professor... am I in command? - That's right. | - Then we arm the sub. That is, if you want me | to get you back in one piece. Did you also | salvage a crew? We have picked volunteers- | experienced men. There will be | two scientists on board. Professor Montel | and his assistant, Professor Gerard. We aren't positive | which island it is... but a certain freighter, | the Kiang Ching... has been up to this area | several times before... with cargos of concrete | and heavy metals. She's loading again | at Tientsin. The last time I tailed a freighter, | my price was 650 a month... and I had to buy | my own uniforms. All right. I want my own key men- | men who've served with me before. You name them, | and we'll get them. Like you got me, huh? | For cash. If it's necessary. As I said before, | Mr. Jones... each man has | his own reason for living... and his own price | for dying. I hope, for all of us... that it will be | a bon voyage. Giovane.! | Help him with the line. Giovane.! You! You, Carpino, | give him a hand with the torpedo. How many hands | you think I got, Neuman? Mr. Neuman to you. - Now, make sure you give me the reading on that battery. | - Right, Skipper. Come on. Come on.! Bring it on, boys. | Bring it around! Come on! Hey! Come on now. | Easy now. Come on. Come on. Come on. | All right, hold. All right, boys. | Make it fast to the cleats. Hey. - Don't you ever take a bath? | - Ah, shut up. "Ah, shut up. " | Is that the extent of your vocabulary? What'd you ever give up | the wrestling racket for anyway? I just found out | it was phony. That's the trouble with these- I say, that's the | trouble with these phony wrestlers, Dugboat. - They never take a bath. | - We do too. Hey, Joto. Hey, Joto. | The after valve won't turn. - What? | - The after valve won't turn. No, no. The other way. Everything backwards. No wonder | you blokes lost the war, subs like this. - Skipper. | - Yeah. - That guy Welles- any good? | - Best engineer out of Australia. - Wish we had Wilbur. | - Yeah. With Charlie Wilbur handling the engines | on the Bowfin... there was nothing | to worry about. Hear he's | a three-striper now. Yeah, so I hear. Skipper, that number two scopes | don't work. - What's the matter with it? | - Can't get the rust out of it. - How 'bout number one? | - Didn't check it. Lift her up, Holter. The professor topside | wants to see the captain. Send him down. He's part of the brass | behind this setup. Now, if he looks familiar, | don't say anything. I'll explain later. - Hello, Professor. Welcome aboard, sir. | - Captain. Well, we're trying to put | this sewer pipe together... with a little spit | and a lot of sweat. - I guess we'll make it all right. | - Captain Jones. What's the matter? | Is there something wrong? I'm sorry to say we cannot permit | one of your crew to make this expedition. What do you mean? | They were all handpicked. - We cannot trust this one. | - Who? The torpedo man, | Revnik. Oh, one of the men | you picked. I could have told you that | all the time. A knothead. Did you screen | all my men too? Very closely, | including you. - Okay. I'll get rid of Revnik right away. | - Good. Holter, I want- She the replacement, Doc? Gentlemen, this is Professor Gerard, | my assistant and my right arm. - Hiya. | - Denise, this is Captain Jones. - Captain Jones. | - Glad to know you, Professor. Well, if I'd known about this, | I'd have cut my price. Boys, these two professors | are going with us as cargo. - What? | - You heard me. Have you blown a gasket? | Nobody takes a female along in a pigboat. Look, junior, you gonna give me that | 2,000-year-old navy bilge that they're bad luck? Take a look at her. | What's so bad about that? Nothin'. | Absolutely nothin'! Ah, they're allJonahs. | It's traditional. Look, Skipper, I made up my mind. | Count me out. Okay. Anybody else? I'll give you jokers five minutes | to sleep on it, and remember... if I have to, | I can replace every one of you. Captain, I do not | like it either. Oh, excuse me. Perhaps you are right. In your estimation, | I am a- a female. But first I am a scientist... | and a good one. And I am not the only scientist | who is not of your sex. There are many. Like Dr. Lise Meitner... who played an important part | in the development of the atom bomb. Like Madame Curie, | who discovered radium. I have grown up | in laboratories. All my life, | I've worked with men. Never have I | interfered... and never have they | resented me. Professor Montel and I have- | have much to accomplish. Much. And I shall | appreciate it... if you would not let | my- my presence... be the cause of- | of a minor mutiny. I like you. I like you all. And I shall try my best | to make you like me... as a scientist. Man, that was quite a mouthful | for a female! That's no female. That's a scientist! All right. Come on. | We got a lot of work to do. Let's go. Hi, Mr. Fujimori, | Professor. - Where's your assistant? | - Are you prepared to sail? I'll let you know tomorrow | after we make the running dive tests. There's no tomorrow | left for us. The freighter Kiang Ching | sailed from Tientsin a half hour ago. - You must leave right away. | - What are you talking about? We only been working for two weeks. | We've got a lot of work left to do on this tub. - You must leave by dark to overtake her. | - What about the running tests? As an amateur, might I suggest | that we try the running test... while we are running? Doc, there are about a hundred ways | of losing a submarine. You've just come up | with one of the best. We haven't even checked | the torpedo tubes yet. You know what that means if we have to | call on fish? It means we're dead. You've got to | leave tonight. Okay, buster, you're buying this trip. | You want me to chance it? It's not what we want, Captain Jones. | It's what must be done. All right. Just as long as the professor here | knows what he's letting himself in for. We've arranged airplane contact to give you | position on the Kiang Ching. - How'll they contact us, blinker or radio? | - Neither is without risk. We've decided | cork drop is safest. This contains your code... and this contains | your schedule for contacts. Oh, just one more thing. I want a clear-cut directive detailing | my specific authority. You'll find it all | in here, Captain. At sea, you are | in complete command. On land, Professor Montel | is in command. May I wish you | the best of luck? Thanks. Well, now's as good a time | as any, Mr. Neuman. - Take her down to periscope depth. | - Yes, sir. Clear the bridge! Dive! Stand right over there, | you'll be all right. - Thank you. | - Professor Gerard, give me your hand. Watch that top rung. | It's murder. - Thank you. | - You're welcome. You sit right... here. Captain, trim satisfactory | at periscope depth. - Very well. Joto. | - Yes, sir? Give Welles a hand with those starboard | engine blueprint translations, will you? I'll take care of it, | Captain. Everything's tight | in the forward torpedo room. We're gonna try her down deep. | Have all stations checked. Let me know. Aye, aye, Captain. This is that test we were talking about | today, Professor. - Now? | - Now. Don't get nervous. If we crack up, | you won't get a chance to feel it. Take it easy. | It'll be all right. Put her on the bottom, | Mr. Neuman. Two degrees | down bubble. - Flood negative. | - Flood negative. Oh, thanks, Chin Lee. - Coffee, Professor? | - No, thanks. - How 'bout you? | - No, thank you. Two hundred feet, | Kapitn. Better hold on, | Professor. All right. Now let's see if we | can hit the roof. - Take her up, Mr. Neuman. | - Close all main ballast vents. - Stand by to surface. | - Stand by to surface. - Surface. | - Surface. - Blow all main ballasts! | - Blow all main ballasts. What's with the air banks, | Holter? - The air bank's dry. | - Open the emergency banks. Put 'em on the line. - They won't open. | - They've got to open. We've checked everything. - These signs are all fouled up. I'll have to try every valve. | - Now, wait a minute. Joto, come to the control room. | Unsnarl theseJapanese signs. I can translate it. That one reads, | "Open emergency air bank. " - What? | - "Open emergency air bank. " Go ahead. Try it. - Air bank's on the line. | - Good. Thanks. Okay. Put her | on the roof. - Skipper. | - Yeah. Everything all right, Carpino? Just a few leaks around the stuffing glands. | I marked them. Okay. Make | a full sweep, Ski. All clear, Skipper. Rig for red. | Up scope. You better move out, | Professor. This helps get our eyes used to the dark | when we go up. Open the hatch, Holter. You did a good job | translating that sign, Doc. Professor Gerard | is M.O.L. - M.O.L.? | - Master of Oriental Languages. Oh? | Trs bon. Trs bon. Down scope. Glad to have you aboard, | Professor. Glad to be aboard, | Captain. Captain. The professor wants to know | if it's all right to come up for fresh air. - Which one? | - The one with the beard. Oh. Okay. Come to course 355, | ahead full on both engines. Aye, aye, Captain. You won't need your umbrella, Professor. | She's a dry boat. It's nothing | to worry about. Almost everybody gets a touch | of claustrophobia first time down. It's not claustrophobia, | Captain. It's the realization | that, at last... our mission has begun. If anyone had told me | six months ago... that today I would be on a submarine | headed for arctic waters... in search of | a secret atomic base- - I just can't believe it. | - Yeah, I know what you mean. Well, uh... what about your assistant, | Professor? What makes a girl who looks like that | get mixed up in science? She comes from | a family of scientists. She was a child prodigy. At 14, | she entered college. At 18, she studied | at Gttingen. She is really | very brilliant. A child prodigy | with a body by Fisher, huh? And this is the greatest pigboat | in the whole submarine service. The U.S.S. Bowfin. It's one we served on | together- me, the chief, Gunner, | Dugboat and the skipper. Beautiful, ain't she? Oh, yes. | Very beautiful. You know something else | that's very beautiful? All my life I've been | wanting to find a girl called Denise. Oh, Ski, I'm sure you will find her. Oh, I found her, | all right. You see, I lost no time at all | in learning your first name. Yep. Denise. | It's always been my favorite name. I- I never met | a Denise... but I always knew I would. You see, from the moment | I saw you, I said, "Lafayette, I'm here. " That's right. I always knew | I'd meet a girl called Denise. D- E-N-I- Don't let him | kid you, honey. I just seen him | put your name on his arm. - Look. | - All right, bub. You asked for it! No! Come here, | you big drunkard! That's what I mean byJonahs. | They were beefing over the dame. Wasn't her fault. | He's stiff. - She okay? | - Yeah. Just roughed up | a little. Take care of him, | Holter. Oh, here, | let me help you, Professor. - Thank you. | - Let's see. Boy. I'm really very sorry | about this, Professor. That drunk was | a last-minute replacement. - He's all right when he's sober. | - I'm sorry. This is the last thing | I- I wanted to happen. It had to break out sooner or later. | Let's have another look here. Whew! It's lucky you | still got your teeth. Don't get nervous, Doc. | Nobody's gonna bite you. Don't you think that the pharmacist | should treat me, if it's necessary? He's got his hands full | with those two lugs. Besides, there's nothing | he can do that I can't, you know. Oh, my. He got you | so greasy. Okay. You know what a log is? - Yes. | - You do, huh? Well, I'm supposed to keep a detailed report | of everything that happens. - It's for Mr. Fujimori. | - Mm-hmm. How'd it start? I was working | on a new formula... when Ski asked if he | could show me his chest. - Show you his chest? | - Yes. Oh. And then what? Then he removed | his shirt. No kidding. - He wanted me to see his tattoo. | - Oh, no. - It was a beautiful tattoo. | - I'll bet it was. - Beautiful. | - Mm-hmm. - But the intoxicated one rubbed it off. | - Naturally. Tell me, uh, | he make a pass at you? - A pass? | - Did he try to kiss you? Yes, he did. He did, huh? | Did you coldcock him? - What? | - Did you hit him? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hold the phone. Hold the phone. | Now, say that in English. - I slapped him. | - You did, huh? Uh, tell me, uh... you hit him after | he kissed you? - Yes. | - Not before, huh? I do not understand. Well, you see, Professor, I-I just want | to make sure my report is factual. - I-I couldn't put- | - Captain Jones. Is this report for Mr. Fujimori... | or for you? - Uh- | - Mmm. Now, really, a child prodigy oughta | be able to figure that one out. Don't you think? - Yes. | - Yes. Au revoir, Professor. Now listen to me. I don't want any more beefs, | you understand? If I hear of anybody | making a play for that girl... I'll personally shoot him out through | torpedo tube number one. Captain, is it still a secret | where we're goin'? We're tailin' a freighter | to an island in the North Pacific. Gonna sink her? We're gonna sneak into this island, | take a look and sneak out. This is a scientific | expedition. - But, Skipper, what are we lookin' for? | - Four-leaf clovers. Well, what if the guys on | the island don't like us? Look, I know you're all | itchin' for a little action... but you'll only get it if we | have to defend ourselves, so relax. CapitaineJones? Le CapitaineJones. - Mm-hmm. | - Bonne nuit. Bonne nuit. Oh, good morning! - Was the water hot enough, Professor? | - Just wonderful, thank you. - Voulez-vous "fume"une cigarette? | - What? - I'm speaking French. | - Oh. Voulez-vous "fume" | une cigarette? Oh, you mean | "Voulez-vous fumer une cigarette?" - That's what I said. | - No. Fumer. - Foo-may. | - No, no, no. You have to form | your lips like this. Fumer. Fumer. I think I better go now. Thank you. You know, someday I'm gonna | find out what color her eyes are. Good morning, Captain Jones. | You wanted to see me? Why did you let me sleep | through that plane contact? I thought you needed the rest. | You were on duty for almost 20 hours. Didn't you stop to think how important | that message might be? Of course. So I made sure | that it was not... by decoding it myself. As you see, | it reports only... that the Kiang Ching has made | no change in speed or course. I knew that was | of no importance. Professor, did it ever | occur to you... that I might be steering | a course to be- You've lost us | approximately two hours! I'm very sorry, | Captain. - And I think I have learned something. | - I hope so. If you want to listen in | on conversations, use the intercom. - It's easier. | - That conversation I would prefer not to have heard. - But I was waiting to see you. | - Okay, you see me. I'm busy. Many years have I been | with Professor Montel... but never before have I heard anyone | speak like you... to the greatest | scientist in his field. Professor Montel's field isn't commanding | a screwball submarine. Mine is. If such rudeness | is necessary... I hope this will be | a very short cruise. What'd you want to see me about? - Joto. | - Yes, sir? In the future, when a message comes in | to this boat, I get it... no matter who says it's unnecessary, | you understand? Yes, sir. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! No, no, no, no. This time, he was right. May we come | on the bridge? Sure. Help yourself. Contact plane | approaching on schedule! Good enough. Okay, Charlie. There it is! Well, this one's | for you, Doc. "Intelligence reports Kiang Ching | carrying unconventional-type... 61-J capsule. " Signed, "Fujimori. " | What's a 61-J capsule? The charge to explode | an A-bomb. Hey, Skipper. | Radar shows surface object approaching... bearing 355 degrees. - Speed? | - Can't tell yet, but he's closing fast. - Range. | - 3,800 yards. - Maybe the freighter has seen our signal and comes after us. | - Rig for red. A sub's after us. A sub? I thought this was | a scientific expedition. It is, and we're | gonna play it safe. No use getting a bloody nose | unless we have to. She's submerged | and listening for us. - That's why she stopped pinging. | - What does this mean? It means she's saving her torpedoes, | waiting till we surface. Just one more day, Doc... and we'd have finished | overhauling those torpedo tubes. Can you see her scope? No. Well, we can | play possum too. - How's the hydrogen? | - Built up to three percent. Well, we can't chance surfacing here. | We've got to make a run for it. Professor, I think | you'd both better stay in your quarters. Down scope. They're still | on our stern, Skipper. - How's that hydrogen gas? | - Four percent, and still building. Take her up! Okay, Charlie. You better keep off | the bridge, Professor. I'm not going up. The skipper'd blow his top if he even | found you here in the control room. - Sit down, Professor. Grab some air. | - Thank you. Have you identified | the submarine? No. We haven't even | seen her yet. They're topside | trying to spot her now. No sign of her yet, | Skipper. Sonar tells us she's not far. | Alert the gun crew. - What? | - I know. We're not lookin' for trouble. But we'd be fools | not to protect ourselves. Alert for | battle stations! Gun crew stand by to man the deck gun. What about | these torpedoes? You know those tubes haven't been checked. | Forget the torpedoes! - Where is she now, Joto? | - Range, 1,500. Either she's moving out, | or she's gonna surface. There she is, | Skipper! They're coming out | on deck. Ask them where we are, | Charlie. - Why not man the five-incher now? | - No! The minute they spot a crew near that gun, | they'll throw torpedoes at us. - What are they saying? | - They want to know who we are and what we're doing here. Tell 'em we're a private scientific expedition | headed for the Arctic. They insist | on boarding us. Well, keep stallin'. | Tell 'em we don't understand. Ask them to repeat | the message. Put one over our bow. | Keep asking them to repeat, Charlie. Turn our nose into her. | Steer 001. And get ready | to man that gun. Keep clear | of the lifeline! Right full rudder. Torpedo! Clear the deck! | Clear the deck! Dive! Close the hatch! My hand! My hand! My hand! - Give me a knife! | - No.! No.! No.! - My hand! | - No! Here. - How is he? How is he? | - It's his thumb. All right. | Get 'em all below. Hey, you guys! Come on up here! | Give me a hand, quick! We ship too much water. | Can't hold her up. - Get the angle off and let her settle to the bottom. | - All back full. Enemy torpedo fired. Number two fish out of their basket. Secure all running machinery. | Remain silent. Bilge pump motor's flooded, Skipper. Form a bucket line. | Dump the water in the engine room bilges. That tub's laying for us, Skipper. | She's coming real close. I lost her. Nothing out of her now. | No sound. What do you think, | Skipper? I think she's pulling | the same trick we are. Now watch that salt water. | We don't want any chlorine gas in the boat. Hold it. Captain, this hot heat | is killing us. We got to turn on | the fans. If they heard our fans, you wouldn't | have to worry about the heat killing you, boy. All right, I'll fill in | the picture for you quick. We got torpedoes, but our tubes | aren't in condition to fire 'em. And the Red sub's parked on the bottom | like we are, waitin' to pick us up on sonar. Once she does, | she'll throw more fish at us. So it's a question of who can | hold out longer without air- the Reds or us. If we break first, chances are it'll be | our last break. And we're | loaded with hydrogen. We're liable to explode. But we got one thing | in our favor. We can save oxygen | by shutting up. That's all. Nothin', huh? Nothin'. We gotta save juice. Shift to red. Keep your ears open, Ski. I am sorry, Captain, | for being so stupid. That's all right. | Save your breath. You had to use | the knife. If you didn't close the hatch, | we would all be dead. You're beat. You better get back to | your bunk and take it easy. Come on. - I want to tell you how- | - Shh. Don't talk. Skipper. He's in a bad way. I thought that hypo was gonna do the trick, | but he's sufferin' from shock and loss of blood. If he don't get some air right away, | you're gonna have only one professor for cargo. There's 50 grand | in that bunk. Fifty grand is worth | a little air. Joto, turn on | the white lights. Boys, I'm gonna try | a long shot. If her first couple of torpedoes | miss us, we got a chance. I'd rather pass out without air than have | a torpedo come plowing through us. Now when we start the pump, | we're liable to get a spark. Maybe it'll burn off | the hydrogen, maybe it won't. If it doesn't... we'll blow up so fast | you'll never feel it. Good luck | to all of us. - You got everything straight? | - Yes, sir. Now here's where we find out | if we've lived right. No more chance of explosion. | Pass the word along. And build up | the turns slowly. - Hold down the noise. | - Yes, sir. - All ahead one-third. | - Yes, sir. - Take her up and level her to 175 feet, Mr. Neuman. | - Yes, sir. She's speeded up, Skipper. Bearing 240 degrees. Right full rudder! | All ahead flank! - Stand by to ram! | - Stand by to ram! Range 200, | bearing 010 degrees. Left full rudder! | Take her down to 190 feet. - 190 feet. | - Stand by to ram! All back, emergency! | Blow all main ballasts! Captain! Captain! There you are. | Are you sure you're all right, Doc? - Yes, thank you. | - All right. Now take a good deep | breath of fresh air. Feel all right, Dugboat? Yeah. For a quiet scientific expedition, | I couldn't feel better. You look awful. | Let me see your tongue. It all real cool, man. This are the end, Jackson. I'm learning French. You know, | like Chin Lee learned that American song. You're wasting | your time, junior. - Hi. | - Hello. Say, uh, if that music disturbs you, | I could have it turned off. Oh, no. | I- I love music. - Oh. That? | - Mm-hmm. Well, how's the hand, | Professor? Wonderful, Captain, | as you see. - Good. Glad to hear it. And how are you, Professor? | - I'm fine, thank you. - Swell. You know, uh, when I- | - Captain Jones.! - Come topside, please. Freighter in sight of land. | - Excuse me. Bonne chance. I don't understand. Our intelligence report | cannot be this wrong. All we are getting is a normal count. - You ought to be happy. | - Don't misunderstand. Nothing would please me more | than to know that our suspicions are unfounded. Then let's move out. There's nothin' here but this two-bit garrison | and some beat-up storage tanks. It's a great pity | I cannot talk to them. We are worlds apart. | But, after all, they are human. - Let's go. | - But Neuman. Forget it. | Shot right through the head. Let's get out of here. Ski, try to knock out that light.! All right, come on! | Let's get outta here! You yellow dogs! Come on, Ski. Give me a hand. | Let's get him in the boat. You wanted to talk to one | of these "humans. " I got one for you. Wet down your coats. Well, they must be combing | the whole area for us... but so far, nothin', huh? Not even a seagull. Hey, Dugboat, you sure this jelly I'm rubbin' | on my chest won't eat off my tattoo? What are you worried about? | You can always get another. Are you nuts? That's my | "piece de resistance. " - Your piece de what? | - That's French. I been practicing, | "nessie-pas?" You need more practice. Captain Jones. | Professor Montel wants to see you in sick bay. - Want more coffee? | - No. No, thank you, Chin Lee. Thank you. This is wonderful. - You want to see me, Professor? | - Yes. Denise has just | translated his orders. His name is Ho Sin. He's a pilot en route | to Kevlock Island for special duty. - So what? | - Kevlock must be the island Captain Taylor photographed. Well, how do you | figure that? An air force pilot would hardly be assigned | to duty on an island without an airstrip. And as you know, Kevlock is the only island | indicated by name in this entire chain. It appears to be due north | of our present position. And what do you suggest | we do about it? It seems to me | our course is obvious. - Not in my book, Doc. | - What do you mean? I mean you said once that each man's got | his own reason for living... and his own price | for dying. Well, my reason for living | is 50 grand. I'm not sticking | my neck out again. - Is one neck that important, Captain? | - It is when it's mine. What kind of man are you? Hold it. Hold it. Let's not gang up | with a lot of double-talk. I'm a businessman. Maybe to a couple of flag-wavers like you | I'm a mercenary. All right. But I lived up to my part | of the contract. The deal was to tail | the freighter to the island... put you ashore | and get you back to Tokyo. Nobody said anything | about a second island. So as far as I'm concerned, | mission completed. We're going home. Any objections? Yes. I hate to use authority... but if I have to, I will. I didn't want it | to come to this... but as long as you have | mentioned the contract... study it closely, Captain. You will find a paragraph | stating that I... and I alone... shall determine when | the mission is finished. And in my book, Captain... the mission will be finished | after I am taken to Kevlock... given the chance | to examine the island... and returned to Tokyo. - Joto. | - Yes, sir. - Head due north. | - Did you say north? You heard me. | Set a new course for Kevlock Island. - It's on your chart. | - Yes, sir. Okay, Doc, let's go. What's the matter? My knee. - I thought you said it was okay this morning. | - It was. - I'll manage in a few moments. | - Not a chance. You'd just be in the way. - It will improve by tomorrow. I'm sure of it. | - Sorry, Doc. We're not hanging around these waters | that long. This is a powder keg. Wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. | What's going on? What are you talking about? Captain Jones... my assistant | will accompany you. - What? | - She has sufficient training to compute figures... determine strength | and identify elements... if there are any | on this island. You mean you'd- | you'd let her go? With the exception of me, Professor Gerard | is the only member of this expedition... capable of performing | this task. Oh, you're both crazy. You will take her ashore... and follow her instructions | as you would have followed mine. She is not going, | and that's final. You still cannot take an order, | can you, Captain Jones? And what's behind that crack? Exactly what you think | is behind it. Ski, you stay here. | Keep your eyes open. What about her? | I could carry her equipment. She can take care | of her own equipment. Psst! Take a look down there. Looks like | a bunch of doors. I'm afraid we have found | what we are looking for. A Geiger counter reaction like | this can mean only one thing. These figures- What are they saying? They are looking for Lumfong, | a missing soldier. We gotta stay put | till they move out. Come on. What did you mean when you said | I still can't take an order? Your record, Captain. In the war you were a very good officer, | except for one thing. Go on. I'm fascinated. You could give orders, | but you couldn't take them. Now look, I- I know what you're | talking about. But if you want to know what makes a guy tick, | you've got to look beyond the record. Those Philippine guerrillas | were cut off and surrounded. They had to have ammunition | and supplies. I couldn't just sit there | on my can and let 'em die. I knew the waters were mined, but I figured | I could get in, get out without a scratch. So I wrote my own orders. I lost my sub and 26 men. And if I had to, | I'd do it again. I'm sorry... very sorry. It was wrong of me | even to mention it. Forget it. | It's all over. - You all right? | - Fine. When this is over, | if we get back... what gives with you? - Gives? | - I mean, what're you gonna do? Go back to Paris, | I suppose, huh? - Paris is my home. | - Yeah. And you? When this is over, | what gives with you? I don't know. Have you ever | been in Paris? No, never. You would love it. Americans always do. Well, we can't stay here. If they hold us up till morning, | we might never get back. I'm gonna see if there's | another way out of here. Come on. You stay here. | I'll be right back. Here. You won't need this, but sometimes | the sight of it's a comfort. I'll be back | in a minute. Lumfong? Lumfong! Denise! Give me the gun. Come on. | Let's get out of here. Come on. Hurry up. | Come on. Come on. Let's go. This confirms | our worst fears. The atomic reaction | is unmistakable. I don't get it. I mean, I can't figure out why | that bomber was on the runway. What would a B-29 be doin' | on a Red air base? It just doesn't make sense. Say, didn't you tell me that | that Red officer... - we picked up on the other island was in the air force? | - Yes. A major. - Were you ever able to question him? | - Impossible. - I tried, but he would not say a word. | - Oh. Oh, thanks. Hey, did you talk to that | Chinese prisoner, Chin Lee? He has not | seen the prisoner. The prisoner | has not seen him. Holter, dig up that portable microphone | and plant it in the torpedo room. Then get the prisoner and lock him in there. | Make sure he doesn't see the microphone. - Right. | - Give him a hand, Ski. Come on. Let's get into some dry clothes. | We got work to do. - You have a plan? | - I'm gonna find out what this is all about. Come on, Chin Lee. | We got a job for you. Let's go. - You guys got everything set? | - Yep. Okay. Now, you're sure Chin Lee understands | exactly what he's supposed to say, huh? - What'd he say? | - He says he would do anything for you. He wants you to strike him | in the face... to make it look more real. Holter. He wants you to do it. He says it will not hurt | if you do it. You all right, boy? | You okay? What's he sayin'? He says... the prisoner is very intelligent | and must be fooled. He wants you | to hit him... harder. I'm sorry, pal. All right, get him out. | Let's go. Here. Come on. Take 'em. This is incredible. What's it | all about, Skipper? This is the screwball plot | of all time. They're gonna drop an atomic bomb | on Korea or Manchuria and blame it on us. They're taking off tomorrow at | dawn in that made-over bomber. He found him out! Now listen to me. I'm shoving off | for the island alone. I'll park myself right here, | around the mouth of this cave. You'll submerge half a mile | beyond the runway, right around here... so you'll be able | to spot my signal. Now a heavy load of fuel's | gonna bring that bomber out low. So when I give you the signal- | two short, two long, two short- that'll mean | the plane's taking off. That'll give you just time | enough to surface and fire. I want every gun in action. That means everybody. That plane has to be | knocked out of the sky. Now the minute you hit it, | crash dive to the bottom and stay there... because everything's gonna break loose | when that bomber hits. There's a cove at the north end, right here. | That's where I'll hide. Tomorrow night at 10:00 sharp, | I'll give you three short blinkers. Pick me up. If I don't show up, | shove off, head for home. Any questions? I forbid this insanity. Forbid all you want to, Professor. | That plane is not gonna make it. It is dreadful enough | to bring back the terrifying report... that our suspicions | are confirmed. But we cannot take it upon ourselves | to commit an act of war... no matter how we feel. We are civilians! I am responsible | for this expedition. I order you to take this submarine | back to Tokyo! I don't care about you | and your expedition. There's an enemy bomber out there made up | to look like an American bomber. It's gonna drop the biggest egg in history, | and we're gonna take the rap for it. I don't like that. So from now on, Professor... this is my expedition. Skipper.! The boat's gone! - What? | - The boat's gone. Montel took it. - Well, why didn't you stop him? | - We didn't get the chance. He was on deck with her. | Before we knew, he was in the boat and gone. - Where's the girl? | - On the bridge. Please. He doesn't | want you to stop him. Why didn't you stop him? | All you had to do was yell. He knows your plan. | He'll carry it out. That's his orders. That's the trouble with you geniuses- | full of big ideas. Now you're fouling up | the whole works. - You know that island's crawling with soldiers. | - He knows that too. Then why'd you let a nice old guy like that | take a shortcut to the cemetery? He's no ordinary | two-bit professor, you know. He's Montel, | top man in his field. But he's old and helpless- | doesn't know his way outside of a test tube. You oughta know that. | You work close enough with him. - What kind of a woman are you? | - Stop! - Haven't you got any feelings? | - Stop! He's my father. What? My father. Oh, I'm sorry, Denise. I'm sorry. | Forgive me. He said... | it was his place to go... not yours. I'm sorry. She's sure | got a lot of guts. Only thing I can't figure | out is why the big mystery? Why didn't she let us know | he's her old man? Well, that's what you have to pay | for having a famous father. She's been on a spot | all her life. Wanted to make good | on her own, and she did. And he was proud | because she did. Any sign of him at all? No, not yet. There he is. And there's his signal. Battle surface! Gun action! Down scope! - You'd better get below. | - Please. Okay. All right, Ski. | Let's go. Come on, Willie. | Joto, get up here. Hurry it up. | Hurry it up. Fire! You all right? - Oh. | - The bomb must have gone off under us. Bring her | back on course. Take her up | to periscope depth. Periscope depth. All compartments, | report damage and casualties. The bomber didn't crash | in the ocean. It hit the island. Head for home. Each man has his own reason for living, Mr. Jones... and his own | price for dying.
