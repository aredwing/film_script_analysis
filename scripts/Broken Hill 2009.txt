Yeah, Dad, sure. I'll just... I'll just finish up. Dad, I thought maybe we could have that talk about the conservatorium. What's that? I said, it's a big game on Saturday. Ah, yeah. Ah, yes. Yeah. We're gonna hit 'em hard. Yeah. Only deal the team is having now is staying focused. Whoa, hey, watch out! Yesterday, police picked up escaped convict Kalai Takalua, also known as "The Mundi Mundi Jail Bird," on the desert outskirts after a third escape from Willyama Jail. Takalua was convicted and imprisoned in 1998 for stealing diamonds from his employer while working in the Kimberley mines. The diamonds, estimated to be worth millions of dollars, were never recovered. Takalua was severely dehydrated and reportedly near death when found by a local teenager. That's right, Sharon. Thomas Mcalpine, a local boy who contacted police, and that'll make a great story at school. Definitely. See? That's right. One of your own is a local celebrity. How about that? And how did he do it? By doing the right thing, by following the law. Tommy? - Tommy? - Huh? Oh. Tommy? Look, to be honest, I was just keeping an eye out for roaming emu... Settle down! You know, I'm just glad he's alive. He looked in pretty bad shape. Oh, he'll be out of the hospital and back in jail in no time. Good on you. Yes! Yes! How does it feel to be totally dominated by a gimp? Mate, you are not seriously going to make me do this. What? Don't be such a chook. You lost the race. Mate, she doesn't even know I exist. If I go up to her and start spouting poetry, she'll think I lost the plot. Yeah, well, do you have a better plan to get her to go out with you? Yeah. No. Look, you've been obsessing over this American honey... I'm not obsessing, man. That's creepy. Okay, sorry. Stalking this Yankee... I'm not stalking! All right, all right. You've been... fancying her from afar. Now, whatever plan you have in your head for getting on a date with Kat, I'm going to go out on a limb here, and I'm going to suggest that it probably isn't working based on the fact you have never actually spoken to her. Mate, I've got enough going on today, okay? I was nervous enough about this talent show before I happened to run into a convict last night. Is your dad coming today? Who knows? Don't get upset. You know your music inside out and backwards. Yeah, but the school band isn't exactly what I had in mind. # Hello, my baby # # Hello, my honey # # Hello, my ragtime gal, my baby # Okay, here's a new version of the music. I can't play this. It's not what we practiced. No, it's pretty similar. Mostly the same. Just some small changes. There's three time signature changes. So, just follow my lead, okay? # And you'll be left alone, o, baby # # Telephone and tell me # You guys, there's four of them. We could totally dress them up! All right. Hey, Maestro, you made it. Do you think I'd miss this? Here. It's for you. Open it. - The conservatorium? - Yeah. - How? - I sent them that CD you made. No, that was awful. It wasn't arranged properly. Well, you got an audition out of it. - Audition? - Yeah. "As an applicant to the composers course..." "A talent scout, Mr. David Wooley, will travel to a venue of your choice for a live audition." Uh-huh. "This has to be scheduled sometime before July 15th." That's only three weeks. Yeah. But this is it, mate. This is it. - Ooh! I'd better get going. - Thank you, Maestro. You all ready? All right, fantastic. Written and conducted by Thomas Mcalpine. Most you folks know the Mcalpines from Harmony Station, especially Coach George Mcalpine, who has led our footy team to three championships! In fact, I think I see Coach Mcalpine here. George, how's the AZ's looking? Are we looking forward to another trophy this year? It's just... it's just kind of slowly going downhill. Well, that, um, concludes our presentation here at Willyama High School. Thank you very, very much for coming. It's obviously not ready yet. Your performance was a little bit rough. But look on the bright side... this composition is one of your best. And you've got three weeks to make it perfect. Yeah, that's not enough time. Especially with these musicians. I mean, they can't play to save their lives. It's like everything I ever wanted is right there in front of me, and I can't reach out and get it. Look, you've got three weeks. Why don't you go to your father, see if you can go to a larger town and get better, more experienced, musicians. - My father? - Yeah, your father. No, my father would never... Holy dooley! I'm late for the game! Thanks, Maestro! Sorry! Dad. Dad... Come late, you don't play. - Next time. - Next time. It's time. How did you sneak up on me in a wheelchair? Stealth mode. I turn off the engine and use my hands, old-school style. But it's time. Oh, mate. Come on, look. Quote what's there, word for word, or it doesn't count. It's good. Mate, I'm asking her out, I'm not casting a spell on her. Yeah, you're casting a spell... you're casting a spell of love. Go on. You lost the race, you have to follow my plan. I'm serious. American football players are wusses! Go. She's right there! I just... I don't think... Anyway, I'll catch you later. Can I help you? You are my sun, my moon, and my stars. A date with you would be like swimming in an ocean of bliss and joy. Will you attend the school formal on my arm? What? You are my sun... No, I heard you the first time, Michael Bolton. Um, look, what's your name? Tommy. Okay, um, Tommy, that was just... freaky, so I'm just gonna walk away now, okay? That guy just asked me to the dance! So, how'd it go? If I, like, lay down in front of your wheels, can you do me a favor and just roll over my neck till I'm dead? Tommy. Yeah, Dad, just a sec. Where are you headed? - Home. - Oh, I don't think so. Dad, come on. It's nothing personal, Tommy. Look, I was at the Maestro's, okay? Tommy, when is enough gonna be enough? - Dad, come on. - 50 hellbenders straight on. We have an early start tomorrow. - You said 40. - 50. Ow! Jeez! Tommy. Yeah? This your truck? It's my dad's. So, are you gonna take me for a ride in it, or what? Yeah, no, I'd love to, but I... You know, Ed's is open late tonight, if you want to go and get... Easy there, Casanova. Okay. Make a left up here, okay? Okay, kill the engine. Hey, look, about on the field before, I wasn't... Shh! Wha...? I like you, Tommy. I need you to do something for me. But first, I need to know whether or not you're in or out 'cause if you're in... ...things are gonna get a little bit crazy. Okay. Koo-ee! Shh! Shh! What's going on? Okay, let's drive down Main Street. Keep the speed above 30, okay? What are you talking about? Tommy, it's just a little good, clean fun. Let's go! Grab on! Keep your speed above 30. Um, what exactly are we doing? You said you were in. Whoo! W- where are we going? Come on, turn! Turn up here! Left here! Whoo! You guys, can you see that over there? What are we doing? - You see that? - Yes, I saw that. Super cool, Tommy! Oh, Kat, get that one! You guys, there's something right here! Oh, no! Oh, trouble! - Jeez, Kat! - Hey, drive! Wait, why are you slowing down? Go faster! I'm not going fast, I'm going to stop! Go, go! Whoo! It's the police. Pull over. - Sorry! - Pull over immediately! Why are you sorry? Don't be sorry, just try and lose 'em. Okay, get ready, we're gonna turn left up here. - You're crazy! - We're gonna lose 'em, okay? We're gonna make a sharp left up here. Whoo! Left here! Now, now, now! Turn now, turn now! Tommy, stop! Tommy, stop! What are we gonna do? Thanks for the ride, mate! What? Thanks, mate! No hard feelings, man! Let's see those hands. Dad, I know this was stupid. Not another word. I know stupid. I was a teenager in this town, just as you. - Dad, I know... - I said shut it. Now, what you did tonight, Tommy, wasn't just stupid, it was dangerous. Someone could have been injured or worse. Could you live with that? Could I? No. Tommy, it's time you take your future more seriously. I am. How's that? I've been invited to audition at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. They're going to send this guy, Mr. Wooley, all the way down from Sydney just to see me perform, and I've only got a few weeks, but if I find the right players... Perform what? Your music? Dad, don't make it sound so stupid. This is the best music school in the country. Sit down, Tommy. Tommy, your performance yesterday was an embarrassment. Now, you want to go away to some music college, and you're not even good enough to impress a bunch of Graziers? You're a cocky, Tommy. Everything else is just a road to nowhere. Now, listen to me. We have bled and sweat our lives into Harmony Station. Through drought and rain, that land has supported Mcalpines for three generations, and if you want to throw that all away to pursue some worthless folly, at least have the common sense to find something you're good at! You're spending the night here, to get your head right. Hey. Hey. You got a problem? No, no. I was the one that found you, on the outside. I'm Kalai. I'm Tommy. Uh, that's a pretty cool song you're singing. What is it? I think you'd call it a prison spiritual. Yeah. Years ago some Christian dudes came in and started a choir, taught us a few songs. I still remember all of them. What are you in for? Uh... there was this girl... Say no more, brother, say no more. I know your story... 'Cause it's the same as mine. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Way guilty. Guilty. If I ever see any of you in here again, I will prosecute you to the full extent of the law. Until then, I'm releasing you into your parents' care. With the exception of Kat Rogers and Thomas Mcalpine, everyone else is dismissed. - What? - What? The ringleaders, eh? Ringleaders? Community service, before the end of September. Are you kidding me? He talked me into it. What? If you hadn't asked me to do this, I wouldn't even be involved. You liar! And you'll do it together. You seem like a good team. Wouldn't want to break this up. You're American. Can't you, you know, call the embassy or something? Right. I'm above the law 'cause I'm from the U.S. So, here's the list. If you'd like, I can help you narrow them down. Can't you just pick one? We have litter control. Sounds good. Re-shelving at the library. That'd expose you to a lot of good literature. Shifts at the sewage treatment plant. We'll do whatever's easiest. Easy? This can be a learning experience for you, you know. We had a kid come in here, he worked for sewage treatment. Now he's manager at the sewage station. Music. What? What? There's a choir at the jail, right? I didn't see that on here. Oh, no. It might not be on the list, but I know they had one, once. If they did, it'd be in the file. Wait, hold on. It looks like there was a couple who had a choir out here years ago. Well, that's what we want to do for community service. What do you mean "we," kemosabe? - I'm not going to jail, okay? - Why not? Maybe 'cause I don't want to get shanked for drug money. Oh, I'm sure it's probably safe. "Probably"? Look, just forget what choir boy says over here. Look, let's just put books on a shelf, okay? I'll just go and check with my supervisor to see if the jail's even a possibility. A choir? Are you serious? Look, I'll do all the work, okay? You just have to show up. I hate classical music. Well, I love classical music. Yeah? Well, I would rather be run over by a truck. I've got a truck. It would be possible, and I think a jail choir's a great idea. Hey, don't forget your information pack. It's got, you know, directions, security details. Okay, we'll meet there at 5:00 on Wednesday, cool? Okay, see you Wednesday, then. What is wrong with you, man? No, no, no. Hold on, hold on. Ha, ha! Gold! So, how'd it go? She's a pretty spunky chick, eh? Guess what, man. I'm gonna start a prison band for my audition with Mr. Wooley. I'm gonna get out of this dump! You've just been seen in public with the hottest chick in school, and you're going on about some band thing? Man, she's a head case! I mean, she got me arrested! Come on, how hot is she? Hoo, hoo, hoo! What is wrong with you, man? Hey, Dad, you know I'm going to be starting my community service tomorrow. I'm going to be helping out at the jail, just stacking books at the jail library for a couple of hours a day. Should expose me to a lot of good literature. Yeah, go get that. I need you to start work earlier to make up for it, work late if you have to. Yeah, of course. Should be good for you, Tommy. # The sound of change is on the ground # # Not the kind to bring us round # # Congratulate our thievery # # Take all we can religiously # # These are the days # You'll always treat the bags like we just did, and under no circumstances can you bring anything in to the inmates. This is Officer Jack. He'll be with you on most of the days. Just going to do another pass. Arms up, please. Just to make sure you don't accidentally bring in anything that might be used against you. We should be okay. Turn around, please. But, uh, it's better to be safe than dead. So, the most important thing is that you maintain an emotional distance from the prisoners at all times. Many of them can be extremely manipulative. They'll prod you for information, they'll look for weaknesses, they'll take any advantage they can get. You can be friendly, just don't forget who they are. - Have a good time. - Thanks. Though the prison's old, it's been upgraded with all the necessary security measures. Just know you're always being monitored, so if something does go wrong, help will arrive pretty quickly. Only prisoners that have earned special privileges will be allowed to attend, so there shouldn't be any problems. There'll be at least one guard with you at all times. Just up ahead. Well, looks like you got a decent turnout. It's all yours. Hi, everyone. Hello. Hi, um... Yeah, well, look, I just want to say thanks for coming out. Um, kind of thought there might be a few more of you, but... Uh, I'm sure we can make do. Um, look... Uh, first, my name's Thomas. Say, uh, why don't you just tell us what sort of music you're going to play for us here, eh? Sorry, can I just ask your name? Bear. Mister. Well, Bear, we're not actually going to be playing for you. We're here to help you guys form a band. I'm thinking we could even go to the Jail Exhibition in Broken Hill. Ah, yeah. I've been there. - Broken Hill sucks! - Mind your manners. I heard they used to go up to Sydney. Could we go there? I guess we could ask, but Broken Hill works better for us schedule-wise. - What kind of band? - Should be like Pantera. Pantera rules. Oh, no. Deep Purple... and we'll need an organ. Well, look. Actually, this band's not really gonna be anything like Pantera or Deep Purple. This band's going to actually be combining both orchestral and choir elements. Well, look, I understand if it's not everyone's cup of tea, you know? You're a real crowd-pleaser. Timmy, mate. Uh, Tommy. - Boss? - Righto. Tommy, get here. See that room over there? Well, that's where they strip and cavity-search us before and after any type of recreational activity, so you might understand why this room isn't exactly full of volunteers. Do good, might get a couple of blokes back. If you're lame, you ain't gonna get anybody at all, you understand? Well, why did you guys stay? I think your band idea sounds good. Very good. Look, uh, you teach me the organ part of "Space Truckin"' by Purple, and I'll be back, all right? Hm. Well, it's a start. What are you staring at, creepo? You remind me of someone. Great. Okay, just try one higher still. - Good. - Listen. Do you even know "Space Truckin"'? Just tell me you've heard it lately. - How does it go again? - Go? Um... Uh... - That's it. - Keep going. # Well, we had a lot of luck on Venus # # We've always had a ball on Mars # # Meetin' all the groovy people # # We've rocked the Milky Way so far # # We've danced along with borealis # # We're space truckin' round the stars # # Come on # # Let's go space truckin', yeah! # # Come on # # Come on # # Come on # # Let's go space truckin', yeah! # # Come on # # Come on # # Let's go space truckin' # - Ricardo, come on. - No, no, no, no. - Please. - What? Don't be looking at me. I'm not a singer, I'm a guitarist, huh? A guitarista. And besides, where are all the other instruments? Oh, well, this is just a warm-up. We're probably done for today, but next time I'll bring some other instruments... Adios! ...and if you bring some more friends, we can get some more people involved. Yeah, right. Don't be expecting any help from that guppy. Guppy? Behind these walls, you got guppies, you got fish, you got sharks, and you got killer whales. If you're expecting any help, you need to ask a killer whale, you understand? Yeah. Which one are you, Bear? I'm a blue whale. Hey, I need you to sign this. It says we completed our hours. Hey, we didn't do three hours. I know. I futzed it so we could get done sooner. Oh, come on! Don't be such a freakin' prude! You're killin' me here, seriously. What, you think this is funny? No. I just like your accent. My accent? You're such a freaking prude. You're killing me here, seriously. I do not sound like that! Yeah, you do! Well, then, who am I, mister... "You are my sun, my moon, my stars. "I'm such a nerd. Go to the dance with me, and I'll be so happy." Well, thanks for your help today. See you tomorrow. It does matter when you're not here. Because we miss you! Hey. Where's mom? She's extended her trip a couple of more weeks. You can find something to eat, can't you? I don't understand! That's twice now! Two more weeks. I don't get it. Well, that's not fair! I am here for her! That was never our deal! That is not the way it was gonna be. No. You never said that. I never would have agreed to that. I'm not going to agree to that, and I am not going to accept responsibility for her behavior either. You know I can't leave the mine! You know I've got to be here! No! You continue to throw this in my face! I'm gonna start a prison band for my audition with Mr. Wooley. That's the spirit, boy! Let's ring the Conservatorium now to arrange a time. Yeah, it'll be July 15th, so we've got three weeks to prepare. We kind of need some instruments. Hm. Restoring instruments has been my life's passion, preparing for an unrealized dream. You, Thomas, can breathe life into them, and they fulfill a measure of their creation. These are my children. I promise I'll take good care of them. Here, Bear, you played one of these before? As if. All right. Mold the wax around so you get a good seal on your lips. He's not bad. This here's Fuzz. Plays the drums, don't you? So I thought he might be good for our band. He told me you play a mean version of "Space Truckin'." Ricardo! A fine instrument, yes, but still, she is hurting on the inside. But I can heal her pain. I can heal it. Okay, well, we should get started. So, um, Fuzz, do you want to show us what you can do? On that? Yeah, yeah. Just give it a go. This thing's too complicated. Uh, well, what kind of drums did you say you played before? Tommy, warden wants to see you. Oh, okay. Just a second. Okay, we are dying here. I'm going to see if I can get some more players. You keep the ones that we have got here. Um, just, you know, tell 'em a joke or something. What?! Warden will see you now. Thanks. Officer Jack informs me that you're here to persuade me to allow inmates to leave this secure jail to perform in a music exhibition. The exhibition is the jail nationals. Prisoners from all over the country are going to perform, and it takes place in Broken Hill at the end of the month. It's Tommy, right? I was transferred here to cut costs, cut frills, and basically turn this country club back into a prison. Unfortunately, it seems the policy makers have a soft spot in their heart for music. I suppose hearing the incarcerated singing helps them ease their collective conscience, so you're approved for now, but be advised, I am the law here, and if you so much as make a "C" when I want a B-sharp, your little social experiment will be over. That'll be all, then. I actually have another question. Um, there's this prisoner called Kalai, and he's got this amazing voice... That will be all. Pushing your luck there a bit. Yeah, I just found that out. Look, Kalai's in solitary confinement. It's a big embarrassment to the jail to have someone escape three times. I wouldn't mention him again. # La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la # That's good, but you have to sing... # La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la # What are you doing? Teaching 'em scales. Since when do you know scales? She's smarter than she looks. Guys, want to show him what we learned? Come on, check this out. That's all right. Wait for it. That thing over there is too complicated. No, that was awesome. But, I mean, if you can do that on a bucket, don't you think you can do it on a real drum set? Come on, just give it a try. Tommy. What you're doing here is all right. You know, showing these boys that a few mistakes doesn't make 'em totally worthless, you know what I mean? All right, so we're gonna give you 100%, and you're gonna do the same for us and get us to Sydney, all right? Yeah, of course. Deal. Deal. Good on you. All right, guys. Well, we'll pick up from there next time, and, um... Remember to tell some more people to come along. Fuzz was really good. Yeah. On a bucket. But why didn't you tell me you played piano? I thought you hated this kind of music. Oh, I do hate this kind of music. Oh, really? No. I had to take piano lessons when I was little. It was just to get out of my parents' way for a couple of hours. I'm not good at all. I'm just not. I don't get how you do it. Do what? Okay, yesterday, Bear just started singing, and just like that you picked it up and started playing it. Oh, that was just practice, I guess. Can you play this? No, I've never played this before. I- I only tinker. I'm not really a pianist. Come on. That was beautiful. Well, I just stuffed up the tempo there, but it was a first try. No, that was... No, no, listen. This is how I played it last night. It was ridiculous. Just so clonky! No, look, you're playing fine! You've just got to relax your wrists a bit. Um... All right, all right. Bring your hands down, and now go really slowly, gentle. That's it. - Sounds a lot... - Yeah, it sounds better already. See, you don't have to rush. That's it. Nice. Hey, kids! Time's up! - We need the room. - Oh, okay. Okay. Thanks! Thank... Thank you. All right, well, thanks. See ya. Dude, you're such a wuss! You drive like my mom! Hold on, hold on... she gave you the look, and you did nothing? It's unbelievable. All right. Can we please talk about something else, you little gossip? She wouldn't even want to hang out with you if it wasn't for me. She doesn't want to hang out with me. She just wanted to use Dad's truck. Well, it was good of him to let us borrow it today. Yeah. Things have actually been pretty good between us recently... You know, since I started lying to him 24/7. Mate, you are game as a piss ant. He will find out, you know. Yeah, but, look, if I get into the conservatorium, it's a different story. Well, how's your band going? Righto, righto. You're a dead man walking, then. Do you know why the warden wants to see me? I have no idea. In you go. Tommy! There you are! Wonderful, isn't it? It's what keeps me sane. We all need something, right? I've just been thinking about what you said the other day, about Kalai. I've changed my mind. I think it's a great idea. We might have to bolster security a bit, but if he wants to sing in your choir, you can have him. Go on, Tommy. I hope you don't mind. I brought some of my friends. This is the one who saved my life, then convinced the warden to let me out of solitary. Give him the same respect that you would offer me. Okay. Well, um, right... who here's ever played an instrument before? Yeah? All right. Good. Great. Well, let's just gather round the piano and let's get this thing rolling. Kalai, what can you play? I can play the didge. Fantastic! Uh, sorry, mate, what have you played? Violin. Violin. Brilliant. Okay, excuse me. There you go. And, uh, what about you? The bells. I'll give you one of them for now, and we'll find something else for you later, but let's start there. Now, we're gonna divide the rest of you into the choral element, so can we split up into tenors and bases? Mate, what are you doing? That's an expensive instrument. It's called col legno. I know what it's called, okay, but it's not what we're doing. No problem. Right. Well, all right. Let's just start off with something nice and simple. Um, Kat, do you think you can play this? - Yeah, I think I can play that. - Okay. Okay, I know it's lame, but we're gonna start somewhere, so just sing, hum, or play along the best you can. That was awesome, you guys! That sounded really good. I think we can move up to something a little bit more complicated. Okay. Here we go. Now, hopefully, some of you can read music. I wrote this one out myself. It's an original composition. It's a bit more difficult. But if we give it our best shot, I'm sure we can impress everyone in Broken Hill. Everyone have a bit of a read, 'cause we'll just kick it off in three, two, one, and... All right, well, it's get... it's getting there, so, um, let's call it a wrap for today. But thanks for all your help and all your effort. That's good. Cheers, guys. - Hey, Tommy. - Yeah? They say I escape to find the diamonds. It's not true. I escape to remember what freedom tastes like. Solitary confinement is a severe blow to my soul. I'm in your debt... again. We're going to Broken Hill, right? Well, we'll see. Hey, Tommy. You're doing all right. You didn't think that went well, did you? Well, it started okay, but it's just really frustrating 'cause I can hear it so clear in my head, and then... You're different than I thought you'd be. So are you. Usually when they bus 'em in from the station, the guys are cocky and self-assured. Thanks. No, they're narrow. Well, my mom was the bohemian. She taught me music. But Dad is the self-assured cocky, so, I guess I fall somewhere in the middle. Your mom must be proud of you. Yeah, she died a couple of years ago. I'm sure she's still proud. She wanted my music to get me out of Willyama and see the world, like you. Me?! My parents' work dragged me around the world. There's a difference between seeing the world and being homeless. Okay. I'm gonna go home now. See you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? # Take some for yourself # # And for your family # # Keep some for your friends # # Even your enemies # # Save some for your future # # Waste some in the now, and... # Tommy, what are you doing? Do you want to go to the dance with me? What? Tommy, careful! Do you want to go to the dance with me? Yeah, I kinda do. Um, but... Look, I'm already going with someone else, Tommy. I'm sorry. You should have asked me earlier. I did ask you earlier. I'll see you tomorrow, all right? You're crazy! # So you keep the letters, and... # # I'll keep the video # Crikey, Tommy, if you're gonna get up early... Attaboy. No, no. No, no. We are way out of sync, all right? Um, we've got to fix this up. First of all, you're coming in two bars too early, okay? Two bars! You're lucky I'm even holding it right! All right, and, um, you're going way too fast, all right? Can we slow it down? And this is you here. Okay, that's the piano, so let's focus on that line there. Ed on bells. Right. Three, two, one, and... # Ooh # No, guys. Okay, it's got to be a clear "ooh" sound or it's not gonna sound right. At least it won't sound stupid. Now might be a good time to stop. Um, okay, guys, we need to take a break there for a couple of minutes. Um, then we'll come back and we'll do it once more, and that'll be it, I promise. Okay? See you back here in five? Leaving already? Yeah. Is that all right? Gotta go get ready... for the dance. Yeah, of course. I mean, you've been on the clock since you got here anyway. Why are you treating me like that? I'm just trying to get some work done. Whatever. Whoa-ho-ho! Girlfriend trouble? She's not my girlfriend. Sure she's not. What's the real deal with Broken Hill? What do you mean? Look, I think your music's cool. I do. But you'd obviously get faster results if you'd do something the guys were more familiar with, something they dig. There's gonna be this talent scout at the exhibition. He's from a school in Sydney, a school that I want to go to. I wasn't exactly up front with the warden about this... Or any of us. Don't sweat it, brother. I've got your back. You want to go to a good school. I understand. I wish I'd done the same. What do you think I should do? Well, they weren't expecting all this. If you want them to stick around for much longer, you're gonna have to do something different. Come on, Tommy, get your head in the game! Tommy, get your head in the game! Get your head in the game. I think I've got to cancel. I'm just gonna make a fool of myself. Again. They can't read music. Some of them are naturally talented, but they've got no training of any kind. They make good noise, but it's impossible to turn the noise into anything. You know, back in the dreaming, you know, back in the dream time, the spirits come down from the heavens, you see. Then they started creating the earth, but saw it was too flat, and they started creating the hills, mountains, creeks, rivers, the trees, the shrubs. All things. And as they were doing that, traveling through, you see, traveling through the land, they were singing a song. The song of creation. And that's our song line. If you went somewhere where there's... where there's no music, you sit there and you listen, and then you'll hear it. The music is already there. Just pay attention, Thomas. You'll find it. # Joanna # # I have not forgotten # # The man # # That I once thought I knew # # For I've heard word # # That he's wanderin' # # A-wanderin' round the bend # # For you # # He asked me # # The fool # Excuse me. - Come on. - Tommy...? # I never... # What are you doing here? I want to show you something. #... stood much of a chance # Come on. - Okay. Close your eyes. - What? - Come on, close 'em. - No way! Come on, trust me. Close your eyes. - Why? - 'Cause. Okay. Okay, first, just listen to everything. Then... Slowly... Just let it all disappear till it's absolutely silent. Now... Okay, now let the dominant sound emerge. That's the crickets. But imagine that sound as if it was coming... from a piano. I can't hear anything. Now, next, the wind. Strings. Introduce a simple melody. Okay, find another. The creek, a cello. The low tone that you can feel, the soul of the song. And then, to top it all off... The choir. Listen to the voices. Where's that coming from? I just made that one up myself. You're crazy! See? The music's already there. Okay, I can hear sounds, but... ...I can't hear a song. What does it sound like? Come on. Come on! Tommy! Okay, listen. Is it just stuff that you hear in your head? Yeah! I love this song. Okay. Fuzz. Got a present for you. Mate, give that a go. That's more like it! Who else wants to bang the bucket? Yeah, over here? All yours. All right. Now, bells guy. - Jeffrey. - Jeffrey. So, what do you know about col legno? We did it with my church. You know that thing where you bang the violin with the sticks? You know, it's really simple. Well, you reckon you can teach some of the others how to do it? Sounds pretty easy... just like ringin' a bell! See, I been tryin' to teach you guys to play my music, when what I should have been doing is listening to the music you guys already have here. And, anyway, this stuff's supposed to be fun. Yeah, so what about the rest of us, eh? I don't sing, I don't play an instrument... not even bells. Well, um... Ever use one of these? This is more your style. Give that a go, Bear. - I'll get you something to work it on. - Hey. Well, it's a start, anyway. Okay, guys, now you've got your instruments, let's see what kind of noise we can get out of 'em. # Ooh, ooh # Okay, okay! Whoa, whoa, whoa! We gotta make some changes. # There's a race to run in the electric age # # Communication caught in the waves # # Transmit the haze # # And we know there's something coming # # We don't know what # # Bleed through the wires # # Hide in the cut # # We perpetuate # # A tragic fate # # I telephone # # Are you alive? # # So let me know now # # I telephone # # Are you alive? # # History reveals the trends # # War's still waged from behind the lens # # We perpetuate # # Revolving days # # And we know there's something coming # # We don't know when # # Reach for the change # # But where to begin? # # We perpetuate # # A tragic fate # # I telephone # # Are you alive? # # So let me know now # # I telephone # # Are you alive? # # Are you alive? # # Are you alive? # # I telephone # # Are you alive? # # So let me know now # # I telephone # # Are you alive? # Nice, guys. Well, we're live tomorrow, so make sure you don't miss the bus. You're sounding good. Thank you. It's sounding so good! Well, it's almost there. Oh, it's there. Thank you. Hey. Good work. I hope you don't mind me performing in shackles. I guess they think I'll make a break. Well, they don't realize my entire life hangs in the balance. Look, I just want to say thanks. I wouldn't even have a band without you. And I'll be starting it off, but they'll be looking to you for that first note. I've got your back. Hello, Tommy. I appreciate your stepping up the last couple of weeks. It's fine. I know being out here away from your music is a big sacrifice. I said it's fine, Dad. You know something, Tommy? I could have been a professional footy player. I was good. I was. Big scholarship. I was living the dream... when one wrong tackle took my knee apart. Yep, I've heard this story before, Dad. Yeah, right, well, what you haven't heard is... it wasn't an accident. I mean... nobody meant for it to happen, but I just wasn't good enough. They were too fast, too strong. Yeah. I was the best thing that ever came out of Willyama. But out there... things are different. I couldn't do it. I risked everything and lost. Why did you lose, Dad? I mean, that's when you met mum, and you had me, and you got the station, so what exactly did you lose?! I understand you're upset. Actually, Dad, you don't understand, all right? See you later. Where you off to? I'm just trying to get some work done. Righto, gents. Hey, Dad, it's me. I'm just gonna be staying a bit late at the jail tonight. I want to see if I can finish off my service hours. Look, I know that I've been a bit difficult lately, but I just know that if I can do this, then everything will be better tomorrow. So, uh, yeah, anyway, I'll see you at home. Mr. Wooley. I'm Pindari, Thomas' teacher. Yes. Oh, good. I was beginning to think I had wasted my time coming. No, no. It seems like a very odd place for a concert. Yeah, I know, but wait until you see what Thomas has done. All right, guys, we finally made it to Broken Hill. Next stop, Sydney, eh? Yay! All right, let's do it! Come on! Okay, everyone up. All right, let's roll. Tuned up? - You all right? - Ready? Yeah, yeah. Very well done indeed. Next up, we'll be pleased to hear from the prisoners of Willyama. - How you doin'? - I'm actually really excited. Good. You should be. Go get 'em. ... Thomas Mcalpine and the Willyama jail band. Where's Kalai? Kalai is gone. We have a security situation. I repeat, Kalai is not here. It's all right, guys. Just settle in and chill out. Ladies and gentlemen, it seems that one of the band members is missing. We would ask you to remain sitting until we get, uh... Evacuate. Tommy! I've got to go find Mr. Wooley, okay? Look, Mr. Wooley. I'm so sorry. I had no idea. Is there any way we can reschedule? Impossible. But it's not my fault. If you just heard my music... Mr. Mcalpine, it's your music that brought me here in the first place, and, quite frankly, it's just been a waste of my time. Good night. Are you sure there's nothing we can do? In you get. Hurry up. Move on. Arms. All right. Ricardo, seriously, I don't know what prostitute I'm reminding you of, but just stop staring at me, okay? You remind me of my daughter, who has never seen me when I wasn't behind bars. She was coming to the performance in Sydney, but now... maybe we don't go. Okay, Ricardo. Arms. Are we still going to Sydney? No. There's no reason to go to Sydney anymore. Hey! Kalai wasn't the only member of this band, you know. Every single one of us put in more time than he did, and you made a deal! Well, I'm not going to Sydney, so... Do you only think this is about you? He hid this inside the instrument. I can't believe I missed it. Maestro, I'm sorry. Missing convict Kalai Takalua remains at large after escaping during a national music festival. It's alleged he hid escape implements inside an instrument and made a break during a performance. Band director Thomas Mcalpine was the first to notice Takalua had disappeared. Mcalpine's the same person who found Takalua in the desert after the escapee's last bid for freedom. Police are investigating why Takalua was at the music festival in the first place. There are new allegations that... If you knew he was going to escape, then why did you let him join my band? That's not your concern. What's important is that this is a police matter now. You lied to me. You've been here, what, a few weeks? Kalai's case has been open for over a decade. Dad, I can explain this whole... I don't think you can. Tommy, you lied to me. See... You want to leave here so bad, well, you get your wish. Dad... There you are. Yeah, Kat's called me, like, three times, but I don't think she's looking to talk to me. Yeah, I don't want to talk to her. Like, they caught your friend, by the way. Turning to regional news, Willyama police have again captured the elusive Mundi Mundi jail bird. That's the man who was caught, escaped, caught again, escaped again. This time he's been caught with over $2 million worth of allegedly stolen diamonds. It was all for diamonds. There are new allegations Takalua's escape could have been engineered by authorities in an attempt to recover stolen diamonds. I have no further comment to make at this time. Clearly, he didn't want to chat. At the same time, we're hearing of trouble inside Mundi Mundi jail. And that's linked to the notorious escapee. I don't want to go. Kat, don't start, please. No. I want to stay. Why would you want to stay here? This is the middle of nowhere. You're gonna love New Zealand. It's gonna be great. Mom's not going, is she? Okay. Kat. How do you think she feels? Abandoned? Betrayed? Not to mention how I feel. Why are you even there? What?! You know what, Sarah, why are you not coming? I mean, that's what I really want to know. Week after week after week! Sir? What is it now, Jack? Uh, the hunger strike, sir. You know, the one that's not officially happening. There are three inmates who claim that they might be able to help you put an end to it. How philanthropic of them, I'm sure. What do they want? You're not gonna believe it. All right, come in. Wow. You are one hard man to track down. So... I talked to the warden. He's gonna give you guys another shot in Sydney. This was never about Sydney. It was about impressing someone from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, and now he's gone. Okay, so you didn't get into music school. So what? Your music is so much bigger than that. You're always talking about trying to get out of Willyama, but you do it every day, like this. I know why you hear it 'cause I can, too. About time! You can hear it? Yeah. And Bear can, and Fuzz can, and Ricardo can. That's with you leading them. Come on, Tommy, you're going to Sydney! Look, I don't know if there's enough time to... Stop your whining. Come on, big baby, let's go. Thanks. Oh, yeah, you're welcome. Look, I just want to really thank you all for this second chance. I know I blew it last time. Hey, Tommy, go faster! I was only thinking of myself. Just kidding! It's all about music now, so I just want to say thanks for all of your hard work. Music has always had the power to transport me, take me somewhere else. So, you know you're not playing here, right? Not today. I finally realized that that's what this music is all about... the heart of it. Escape. Let's go space truckin'! Yeah! The next number will be a large mixed-orchestra piece performed by the Willyama jail band and directed by Thomas Mcalpine. Okay, some of you probably heard what happened at the last concert. So, I'd prepared something to say... But I can't really remember what it was... So let's just let the music speak for itself. Yeah! Bravo, Tommy!
