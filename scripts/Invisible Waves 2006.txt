I meant you. Let's skip dinner... and have dessert now. Oh, but I think you'll enjoy dinner more. You've been working too long for my husband. You're starting to talk like him. I have to stir the sauce. I love it when you talk like that! Seiko, the sauce will be ruined if I don't stir it. That's okay. I like my sauce medium-ruined. Well, that was delicious, darling... as always. Did you have enough? I might have room for something more. I made chocolate mousse. Oh well, there's room for that too. I'll get some more wine. Okay, darling. You're the boss. Oh, wait a minute. Actually, you're not the boss. Oops, sorry darling. Come on, get the mousse and hurry back. Oh, I like this. Let's turn it up a bit, okay? The neighbors won't mind, will they? I have only one neighbor. She won't mind. You don't look like your father at all, you know? You still don't have a TV? What do you do when you're alone? I sleep. But how do you know what's going on in the world? I already know. There's always war. You are so cynical, darling. Kiss me. Are you drunk? Why? You gonna take advantage of me if I'm drunk? You still have to eat your mousse. Hello. No, I don't know you. But I know why you're here. You are a little bit early. Come worship first. I'll be with you later. Did you pray? Why not? I see. You came here for this, I believe. Everything you want is inside there. The ticket, the money, the documents. I'll send you more money... when you're in Phuket. Your life now depends on it. Lizard's contact number is inside. Yes, from now on... he's the one you'll have to contact. Any problem... contact Lizard. Remember, Lizard. Only Lizard. He's your man. Your only contact with the past. Okay, I'll take care of it. Have a good life. My father was. Open it! What's up? Anyone hear me? Hey! What's up? Excuse me. Kyoji Hamamura! I can't believe it! It's really you! Do I know you? Know me? Don't you remember me? Oh! I'm hurt! Sorry. We went to school together! Really? The same school? You have such a bad memory! Come on... - Not exactly. - Where you headed? I have to go and meet someone. But you're meeting me! It's a lot more exciting! You don't look too happy to see me. Well, I'm a bit busy. You really don't remember? Sorry... Hideki! You haven't seen me for fifteen years... and you tell me you're too busy to chat? So how are you? I can't believe that of all places we meet again on this ship. Even the sea can seem so small. Hideki? Yes! Now you remember? And how is your brother? Married? Kids? To be honest I still don't think we know each other. But you are Kyoji Hamamura, right? Yes, but... From Osaka, yes? Yes. But now I live in Macau. Macau? Wow! Great. We went to school together? Yes. Now you remember? Those were the days. Sneaking off to read manga on the way to school. - In Osaka? - Yep. I never went to school in Osaka. I don't think I am who you think I am. You're Kyoji Hamamura! Maybe you know another Kyoji Hamamura that looks like me. How could that be? But I remember you... Really, you got the wrong guy. No, no. I'm sure it's you. I still don't think we know each other. But you are Kyoji Hamamura, right? Yeah, but... I'm sure it's you. How are your kids? Are they wearing braces yet? Look, I don't know you. Must be my mistake. I told you. Sorry about that. So long. Everything we serve is non-alcoholic... except the alcohol, sir. I guess that's true. Okay, give me milk. - Milk, sir? - Yes. Such an innocent drink for someone like you. Someone like me? I don't mean to be rude, sir. I mean, you seem a very experienced man. I don't understand. Forgive me, sir. I make no sense. That's why they put me here. You enjoy your cruise so far, sir? To be honest, no. I see. That's why you come to the bar so early. Why did you decide to take this cruise, sir? Vacation? Not really. Somebody arranged it for me. I see. Like you won a prize? No. Well... yeah. Something like that. Sorry for asking too much, sir. You like your job here? To be honest, no, sir. No? In fact, I hate it, sir. Why do you do it then? Well, this may sound strange to you... but I'm doing it to atone for the sins of my life, sir. What? Yes, well, you see, sir... I was a very troubled teenager and caused my folks many worries. Troubled? Yes, sir. Drugs and stealing, things like that. A bad ass, you know, sir? But then I wised up. I decided I'd do something unpleasant as punishment for my past. I see. My folks had been so nice to me. They never punished me and I got spoiled. So I took this job to punish myself. Now I never get to see anyone... but it's probably for the best I think I understand. May I ask you something, sir? Go ahead. Did you love your father, sir? My father? Did you think he was a good man, sir? Good man? Maybe. But... I wouldn't know much about being a good man. I am not such a good man myself. Maybe my father was a better than me. I think you are a good man, sir. How long will you keep punishing yourself on this ship? I am not sure, sir. I do like the sea. The sea? You don't find it boring? No. I like the feeling that the sea isn't judging me. I just look at it, and it just looks at me. Strange... What's that, sir? It judges me all the time. Check, please. Wilai! Hurry! Hong Kong money, Mama. Forty baht, forty baht. Who took it? Did anyone see it? It was right here. Who took the forty baht? What would you like to drink? Y No... I'm talking to the pineapple next to you. You are Kyoji, aren't you? You are... Your boss sent me. So, what's it gonna be? Err... milk. Of course. A glass of milk, please. You are Japanese. You expected a Thai man? Sorry to disappoint you. You from Japan? Yeah, but enough about me. You don't look so good, man. Well, I have had some trouble. So your boss told me. Anyway, cheers! What did the boss say? Not much. To give you money. Take care of you a bit. He told you who I am? Why, is it a secret? C'mon, man, don't be so paranoid. You're not in Hong Kong anymore. Why worry so much? Guess I'm just tired. Bet you are. You look like shit. The boss told me you might settle down here. Maybe open a restaurant. Don't know yet. That was the original plan. Well, it's not a bad place. I gather you're quite a good chef. Did the boss tell you all this? Who else? We are not so different, you and I. I know what it's like to be in your shoes. I was there once myself. Your boss is very generous. That is, if you're loyal. Did you get the job done? I guess so. Good. Then I guarantee the boss will take good care of you. I've never known such a big-hearted man. That is... as long as you're loyal to him. He also promised me freedom. Freedom, yes. Do you like karaoke? I don't sing well. Ah, but it's not about singing anyway. It's a great invention... probably the best thing Japan's ever given to the world. Think about it. Karaoke's such a great concept. The music itself is empty... but when you who hold the microphone you're the one who fills it with substance. Want to? No, thanks. Sure? C'mon. Really, it's okay. Alright then. I hope you don't mind if I do. I want to give you a welcome song. Hope you enjoyed that. It's my gift to you. Yes, thanks. Well, I guess you're anxious to get your stuff and get back to your hotel. Yes. Very well. It's not a lot... but since it was kind of sudden, it was all I could get today. Come back here tomorrow and I'll give you more. Tomorrow, same time? Yes, that okay? It's fine. Good. And this milk? Oh, don't be silly. It's on me. Oh, thanks. Alright man. See ya. And get a haircut! I guess you want the top floor. Where did he go? There you are. Hello again. Long time no see. Time for a city tour! It's hot out there. Who are you? What? You are Lizard. You're not so stupid after all. The boss sent you to get rid of me. Nah. He sent me on vacation, just like you. You were on the cruise? I've been babysitting you, my man. Why? Why? Not because I like you, that's for sure. Why get rid of me? I did my job. And what job was that? Screwing Madame Seiko? He was going to get rid of me no matter what. Why? You must be the stupidest smart guy I have ever met. Okay... let me tell you a little fucking fairy tale, alright? There was a man. He had an affair with his boss's wife. He got caught. And just to save himself... he agreed to kill the woman he'd been fucking. By the way... this man was a real selfish bastard. Did he think killing Madame Seiko would solve his problem? Did he think it would be that simple? Anyway... we are writing the ending of this tale as we speak. Remember what I said about loyalty? Once you break it there's no going back. Sorry. What about Noi? Well, all I can say is... you weren't supposed to meet her. She was also sent on vacation. Just to clear things out at home first, you know? You're a real trouble maker, aren't you? Creating problems for yourself wherever you go. Even at sea! She's the boss's girl? None of our business. And the baby? Would you shut up and let me sing? Now you're going to shoot me? Well, I could... but I'm a bit tired tonight. So I'm just going to ask you nicely to step into the sack. Then you'll shoot me. Actually, I'm not going to do anything. My boy there will do it. And then throw me in the sea or what? You really are a good guesser. Eventually they'll find my body and it might lead them to the boss. You don't think we're just going to throw you into the sea, do you? These boys may not look it... but they're experts in their field. Sorry, man. I actually kind of like you. Then again... I've done this to people I liked before. Okay! Kindly step into the sack. The stupider he gets the more I like him! Why did you make me do this? I'm so fuckin' depressed. I need a microphone. It's already loaded. Please mind the door. Please mind the door. Hello, old friend. I was waiting for you. To tell you the truth, I'm really lazy tonight. Not in the mood for this sort of thing at all. How about karaoke? That's exactly what I was doing... when the boss called. You are very loyal. That is one thing I'm proud of. Good for you. I have nothing to be proud of yet. You plan to go back home and sleep? And tomorrow start a new life? Not exactly. I'm just going to take a walk. There is no home to go back to. You know this walk has to end sometime, right? I know. And it will end soon. Yes. But will you let it end? Yes. How many times have you crossed this water? A lot. Will you miss it? I guess either I will find out now... or else I'll never know. You sorry you didn't get your revenge? I realized I have nothing to get revenge for. No one really hurt me. Not even the boss? No... he just didn't let me know certain things... that I should have known myself. You could have killed him tonight. Sure, I could have. I wanted to. Why didn't you? He seemed so happy. Very happy. That's your reason for not getting revenge? Who do you think deserves to live more? A happy man... or a homeless ghost? I see. In a way, I envy you. About what? I always wonder what the end will be like. You're about to know. You think it really matters? Yes, it does... but I'm in no rush to be sure. Right. It's getting late. I don't want to keep you. It's my pleasure. But... I guess it's gotta end sometime. Any last words? Could you mail this postcard for me? I'll leave it right here. No problem. Have you put a stamp on it? It helps.
