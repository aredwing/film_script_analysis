NORAD picked up a hotspot|in the Alaskan mountains... just outside of Fairbanks. They contacted the warship Sumanza,|stationed in the Bearing Strait. Commander Drew Stevens|dispatches troops to the area... to observe phase one|terrorist protocol. Expect the worst. Whatever happened was to be|considered an act of war against us. That's when they called me. And in the hours that followed... I learned things that were going to|change the way we live forever. Don't move! There's somebody at the door. Oh, God... You look like shit, son. Why don't you have a seat,|make yourself comfortable? Want to tell me your name? I've already told you people. I'm Doctor Peter Lang.|I need to report to Major Harrison... of Charlie Squadron Delta. I don't have much time. You a military man, Lang? Sort of. Sort of. That's funny. I've been in|military most of my adult life... and I've never met asingle person|who was "sort of" in the military. You're either in or you're out,|don't you think? So a... pretty straight forward answer|I'm looking for here. So, I'm gonna ask you again.|Are you in the military? I can't talk to anybody in this|building. I'm not authorized to. Call Harrison, and he'll understand|the urgency of the situation. I got a pretty good handle|on the situation. Two hours ago, somebody detonated|a nuclear device on U.S. soil... and you're the prime suspect. That's either an act of war or that's|terrorism but either way... you're going to answer|any question I ask you. So, why don't we start this again? Are you a military man, Lang? I need to report to Harrison,|the Joint Chiefs or the President. I'm not authorized to talk|to you and I won't. If you get Harrison, you might|have a chance to save the world. Save the world. That sounds like a threat to me. You keep talking about|this Harrison... right? We've been looking for him since|you've mentioned his name. And... guess what? There is no Harrison. The President and the Joint Chiefs|don't have the foggiest idea... who Peter Lang is nor do they have|any interest in talking to terrorists. I suggest that you put me at|the top of your priority list... and do it pretty quick cause things|are about to get ugly around here. Why don't we try this again?|Who do you work for, Peter? That kind of smarts, doesn't it? Most fellas start belleding from the|ears, but you took this pretty good. -You don't look so bad.|-I have... top information, and you're|treating me like a terrorist. I'm doing that'cause this is|a matter of national security. A lot of people out there|got a lot of questions... and I've been given authorization... to use whatever means necessary|to get answers to those questions. I suggest you start telling|me what you know now... or we're going to go through|this over and over again. I can't. I love these things. This sort of torture|used to be sloppy. Buckets, sponges, big cables. It just wasn't safe. Nowadays, I can carry|4OO,OOO volts in my hip pocket. Pretty effective,|wouldn't you say? I can't tell you what|you want to hear. You have to trust me.|It's for your own safety. You're going to tell me|what I want to know. Why don't we keep is simple,|all right? Tell me how your day started. -Hi, honey.|-Hi, Peter. A phone call would've been nice. You know how I feel about phones. Baby, go wait in your room, OK? Bye, Peter. See ya, Kimie. There's been an|incident in the lab. -ls everybody OK?|-We don't know. I need to get in. I need to find|out and I need your help. Peter, l... An officer will look after Kimie. It won't be long. OK.|Give me five minutes. Don't worry.|I'll be back before you know it. -I love you.|-I love you too. Bye, mom. -OK. Fill me in.|-I will in the truck. Well... at 2:13, Fairbanks HQ received|some sort of garbled transmission. A breach of bio-containment six. Two minutes later, somebody on the|inside initiated a full lock-down. Power's off.|Interlock's sealed. All communications to the outside|world were served from the inside. Look, l... -I called Harrison.|-Oh, Jesus. It could be any number of things.|Chemical, or bio, or nuclear. Whatever it is,|we're gonna need help. There're 14 people down there,|and the clock is ticking. You're right.|We're going to need Harrison. We're going to go in with|asmall combat team. Technical experts.|Harrison's very best. Highest possible clearances,|just in case. OK. If we have to move in,|we move in. But this team of experts|they only the best, right? Right. Come to me. Don't even think about it. I'm on the clock, honey. Don't you think this is more|important than the clock? You're killing me. Sargeant Trainer. DCS tacticalbriefingin|10minutes, Trainer. Trainer? Did lcatch you at a bad time? No, sir.|I'm just about... to clear my weapon. We have a situation. Get O'Brien.|You're going in tonight. Affirmative, sir.|We're going in. Why don't you get whoever is|on the phone to call you back? Trish? Daddy? I'm toast. You... Trainer? I'm Hall. Communications. -Good to meet you, Hall.|-Good to meet you, sir. -You new on the base?|-Yes, sir. -First time in Alaska?|-First. I like it though. It's cold. Trying to get used to the daylight.|Never seems to get dark. Having trouble sleeping, sir. I've been here for two summers|and I still can't get used to it. -And don't call me "sir".|-Yes, sir... OK. What have you heard|about this mission? We're being sent there'cause you|banged the General's daughter. -Jesus Christ!|-What? Bad news travels fast. You know kids. No. You see... she had her 22nd|birthday last week. Whatever you say, sir. Hear anything else? It looks that we're going to be|accompanied by Major Ross and... what's-her-dick?|Get my volley? -Ross...|-Sir? I wonder why they'd send a|Major on a mission like this. Can't say, sir.|Haven't met the man myself... but O'Brien... she really drove our regiment|into the ground in lraq. She's a tough mother for a hole,|let me tell ya. That's what I heard... But why would a half-decent|looking chick like O'Brien... want to be an officer? Everybody knows any chick|that tough has to be a lesbo. She's get in the army to get the|Colonel's daughter, probably. Sir... Ma'am! When you finished bonding,|re-join the rest of the army. Full mission breaking in two. -Yes, ma'am.|-Sarge... you need a larger weapon. Welcome to Alaska, Hall. Thank you, gentlemen. 'Ten-hut! All right, people, at ease. This mission is black. No medals, no rewards,|no lucrative book deals. Our target destination is|Vectol Bio-Research laboratories... outside Fairbanks, Alaska. Although it is a civilian facility,|it is under contract to Uncle Sam... and my responsibility. Dr. Cole... Captain O'Brien,|is our best in bio-chem... Sargeant Hall, is our|communications specialist... Trainer, weapons and|explosives, lastly... Major Ross, our counter-terrorism|expert. Dr. Cole? Three hours ago, someone at our lab|initiated an emergency lock-down. We've had no|communication since. There're 14 researchers trapped down|there. We need to get them out. Only 23 people outside this|room know about those labs. Of those 23 only a handful|are privy to the work they do. Although this is classified,|we'll give you what we can. -Dr. Cole?|-Dr. Lang... head of the Bio-Weapons|Counter Measures at Vectol. Vectol labs are located in an|abandoned copper mine... It's been retrofitted as a|high-tech bio-chemical facility. Access is through asingle|air lock and elevator. There are four levels: research,|weapons, chemical, living quarters. Below that is an emergency air lock.|Once you're in, nothing gets out. There's been only one other breach|of this facility two years ago. A lab tech accidentally spilled|a thimble-full of nerve gas. A thimble-full.|He died ninety seconds later. It took us three months to|clean out that isolation lab. We are dealing with a|full isolation lock-down. Trainer? Why us? Dr. Lang? Vectol Labs do a|multitude of sins. Chemical, bio, nuclear toxins. Stuff we have down there makes|Ebola look like the common cold. It's possible terrorists breached|the facility. We need to find out. Don't we have any other|intelligence on this? Latest satellite re-con|flight shows all is clear. Perimeter secure. This is avery sensitive situation. Fewer people envolved, the better,|that's why I'm sending the best. I'm ascientist, but I'm also|a former Army Captain. Once inside,|all of you answer directly to me. Trainer? People? -ls that clear?|-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.|-Good. These are not your standard suits. They're made from Kevlar Purine|fiber. Think of them as a2nd skin. Your atmosphere gauge|is at the wrist. Green is for good air,|yellow for questionable... and if it's red and you've just|breathed it, you've died. This is for your oxygen.|You have about one hour's worth. What are these syringes for,|doctor? Excuse me. If one of you become|contaminated... remove the hypodermic|from the pouch... and then plunge it|directly in the neck... as deep as... Don't do that. ...as possible. -Avoid severing the carotid artery.|-I'll do that. The needle releases a neuro-toxin. It would save your life and get you|to treatment as quickly as possible. And what if we don't get stuck?|What happens then? That depends on which toxin|you've been infected with... but within 1O seconds your throat|constricts. You can't breath. Your esophagus becomes|brittle and it dissolves. Your organs turn to jelly as your|molecular structure is collapsing. But after that,|you should mercifully black out. I get the picture. Have either one of you tried...|this needle? Yeah. Dr. Cole has. What happened? Gear up.|We move out in ten. Any other questions?|Dismissed. I think she likes me, O'Brien. What are you talking about?|She's a grown-up. I should try that. Colonel! Major. Permission to speak freely, sir. Go ahead. I'm not comfortable taking my|orders from these scientists. You take your orders from me.|Follow Cole and Lang to the letter. Yes, sir, but babysitting|civilians is... Cole can take care of herself.|It's Lang I need you to cover. He works for me.|His project is classified... has top priority on the Pentagon.|Cole doesn't know about it. -She thinks she's in command.|-Work with her all the way. If it's viral or chemical,|she's in charge. It it's terrorist,|you take command. Your priority is make sure|Lang gets his research out. My team has the highest|security clearance. I need to know what's|going on down there. This is a matter of national security.|Nobody can know about it. When it comes to biologicals,|even the President is expendable. Yes, sir.|Lang is the priority. If I'm a terrorist, what's my|primary target down there? There's enough plutonium in that|mountain to satisfy asmall army. Terrorists or not, we're going to|find our people okay down there. Just hope my staff are safe. With this lock-down there's a|chance the air's been contaminated. Keep your helmets on|and breathe easy. And conserve your air|as long as possible. You got that? Cole... if we do encounter terrorists, stand|down and let my team handle this. Your team?|Your team will do what I say. This is a chemical lab. Nobody|does anything without my approval. You got that, Major? Trainer, hold up asec. -I've got a bad feeling about this.|-You're just scared. That's not what I meant. Chemical weapons,|possible terrorists... small crew,|civilian in charge... We're going in there and no one|is telling us anything about it. How many times have you and|I been down this road before? You watch my back,|I'll watch yours all right. -I hate working with civilians.|-You wanted Delta. Deal with it. Lang. What? The minute you know how to get|out of there, you let me know. I don't need my team staying in this|tunnel any longer than they have to. I'll recommend immediate e-vac|as soon as I get what I need. And, Major, our relationship|stays confidential. That's what I hear. Peter, check the intercom,|see if anyone responds. No, doc, not a good idea. If they're terrorists you don't want|to give away our position, right? Good point. Let's keep the|chatter to a minimum, OK? Jesus, Lang!|Will you back the fuck up? Holster that weapon. -This isn't right.|-What's your concern, Cole? The reading. There's something in|the air but I don't know what it is. What's with this water? I have no idea.|I've never seen anything like this. -Hey, Ross.|-What have you got? Looks like a gold tooth. -That's a little more than unusual.|-Got some slime all over it. What's the slime like?|Is it toxic? I don't think so. Cole, you should|take a look at it. Maybe the sprinkler|system broke here. It's not HO or retardant.|Cole... what do you think? -Major!|-Hall. Got a Number 45 here... emptied the clip.|What the hell they shooting at? No matter, but stay Sharp so it|doesn't end up shooting at you. I found a pacemaker. It's still beating. Jesus!|This is creepy. We need to get to work.|Hall, Trainer and O'Brien... restore communications and power.|It's through these doors. It's down one level. Keep to the|right. It's at the end of the hall. After that, sweep level 3.|It's the living quarters. Wait.|You want us to split up? Ross, what do we do? You have your orders.|Report if you see anyone. RCB will be level 2. Containments|labs. We'll meet there. -How many people we looking for?|-Fourteen. You heard the lady,|let's move out. I think we should look for|the guy with the pacemaker. Just my luck, I'm red shit, baby.|This way. Dr. Lang, this isn't a picnic.|Let's move. -This is worse than we thought.|-You recognize it. It's got the molecular|structure of human DNA. -Doctors? What is this stuff?|-We're not sure just yet. Major, I wouldn't stand|under there if I were you. Where the hell is everybody? I don't know. Trainer... ever notice our missions have|become a little more hazardous? What are you talking about? Look around you. We're in a|factory full of biological weapons. So, what's that|got to do with me? She's jailbait and she's|the Colonel's daughter. Would you put a pipe in it? She's not jailbait, Captain.|She looks at least 19 or 2O. That's my man, Hall.|She ain't no child. You're just jealous, O'Brien. Come on, O'Brien,|who you kidding? Wouldn't you take a run|at her if you had a chance? Careful, Hall,|or I'm going to take a run at you. Want to get you guys a room? Hall's not my type, Trainer. -He thinks I'm a lesbo.|-I'm OK with lesbos. Just kidding. It's gone. What? No, that's impossible. -What's gone?|-I can't talk about it with you. I don't give a damn about|your secret weapons. I'll tell you what you need to know|when you need to know it. -Are my people in any danger?|-Not more than the rest of us. -That's not an answer.|-Give us a moment, Major. One of our experiments has gone|missing. We need to find it. -Ross. Copy?|-Go ahead, Captain. Auxiliary power was up|in the lab level only. The generator doesn't work.|Hall can't get any more power of it. Good work. We've completed the sweep of the|living quarters. Not asoul, sir. Proceed to communications.|Try to raise Harrison. And Captain... watch your back. Anything on your end, sir? One of the doctor's experiments|has gone missing. -What kind of an experiment?|-They're both tight lipped. Until I know more, assume we're|still dealing with terrorists. Exercise extreme caution and|report back every 1O minutes. Understood. It's not just awalk in the park. Not today. If I can squeeze any|more out of them I'll contact you. Roger that. -Reporting back in 1O.|-ln 10 minutes. Missing experiment. -Doesn't sound too good.|-Not in this place, it ain't. Stay Sharp.|We got a job to do. What the hell happened here? You fix this up, Hall?|Raise topside? I could raise Mars|if I had to, but... it's probably easier to... jerry-rig the up-line and get|cell communications working. This is creepy. Slime covering everything. Like something out of the Blob. -Holy shit, Hall, that's it.|-What? The doctor's experiments is|probably just like the Blob. It's loose and it's sliming up|everything in its path... devouring everything it can. You know what? We're dessert. -You're not funny.|-What are you talking about? You're not funny, man. -You see that?|-Yeah, right. -Let's focus.|-I'm serious. I saw some guy. -I swear!|-Hall. -Jesus!|-You saw someone? -I think.|-Hall, raise topside. Let's go. -Are you serious?|-I'm serious. Get in there. Get communications up.|I'll check the door. All right. Let's hope the containment|lab remains secure. Is it possible somebody moved it? It's possible, but unlikely.|It takes a team of 8 to move it. If it had been moved,|we would have known. -What about the plutonium?|-lt is all accounted for, Major... but right now it's the|least of our worries. The air is clean. Cole, check the|computer data. See if somebody's moved it.|I'll check bio-containment 6. Major Ross, you watch her back. Major Ross, external com|is up and operating, sir. Good work, Trainer. O'Brien, continue to sweep,|report if you find anyone. Roger.|I'llcontinue. Command, alpha team reporting. This is Harrison.|Report. Auxiliary power and|communications restored, sir. We have control ofthe main lab. Still no sign of the staffers. We do however have|a missing experiment. We're going to look for it... ...and any sign of terrorists.|-Keep me posted. You did this to me. Stay here. Watch my back. Jesus Christ! Is that you, Sara?|What the hell happened? It got out. We didn't stand a chance. Nobody's going to|be able to stop it. It's under my skin, Peter.|It's under my goddamn skin! -Sara, no!|-Look what you've done to me. Radiation is the only way to kill it. What happened? -I need to kill us all.|-For Christ's sakes, don't do that! It's inside me.|I can feel it. Inside me. -I can feel it.|-lf you're gonna kill us all, stop! No! Please, don't make me do this. Just stop.|Sara, I'm so sorry. Cole, no! Cole, you just executed a civilian. She was no longer human. Then what was she?|Lang, why didn't you try to help her? She was infected. -lnfected with what?|-There are infectious agents here. Not good enough, doctor. The radiation would've gone critical.|I did what I had to do. I want answers. I need to know now! What are we up against? There are no terrorists,|are there? We can't be certain. I reckon that we leave now. That's the first sensible thing|either of you have said all day. We're not leaving until we|figure out the fate of our staff. You just saw what|happened to our staff. Trainer, give me asituation report. Nothing down here but slime, sir.|Other than that, all seems clear. Return to the lab.|We're getting out of here. If you meet anyone,|assume that they're hostile. Sargeant, keep your|suits on at all times. -Hostile, sir?|-We just met one of the staffers. It wasn't pretty.|She was infected with something. -lt's been secured.|-Secured, sir? -Permanently.|-Understood. Meet back at the lab. -Report anything suspicious.|-Copy that. This whole place is suspicious. Command, this is alpha team. One second. Harrison. Report. The situation isn't good.|We can confirm contamination. Cole, you there? -Yes, sir.|-Situation? The facility has been breached|and the PB3 is missing. Colonel... Isuggest that we brief Ross on|the lntelthat we have on PB3. Our chances of surviving through|this mission will be greater. Fill him in my full authorization. Yes, sir. We first heard about|it after Chernobyl. Soviets discovered an alien|microbe on a meteorite... that crashed in Siberia in the 5O's. They called it PB3 to honor the|third session of the Politburo... or something like that. Once the microbe was separated|it reproduced at an alarming rate. Their scientists|attempted to clone it. No dice. In the end,|it took a2O-megaton nuke... and 1O,OOO lives to put that|genie back in the bottle. After the wall collapsed,|Uncle Sam took all responsibility... and brought it to us. Government hired Vectol to study|the military potential... and applications of PB3|to see how to counter it. As a liquid, it had this... intelligence.|It could think, learn. Imagine, asingle alien life from|the size of a drop of water... that we could train to kill|whatever we wanted it to. A drop of water that could|survive in any landscape... from a nuclear environment to the|blood stream of a human body. What's the difference between... the liquid and PB3? The liquid is what PB3 produces. The PB3 is actually an alien.|We cloned the microbe's DNA. Are you telling me there's|an alien loose down here? Jesus! Alien? Is that so hard to believe? I'm getting pretty tired|of your bullshit, Lang. You'd better start feeding me|something easier to swallow. Sir? Goahead, Captain. We're stillcomingup|blank on Harrison... but we've been able to confirm that|Ross, O'Brien, Trainer and Hall... do in fact exist as members|of the Charlie Squadron Delta. They're stationed in Fairbanks.|Their C.O., Major Tindal... confirms they were requested|for a black op at 04:00. He won't give up any details of the|mission. He wasn't cleared for it. Thank you, Captain. -lt's an alias.|-What are you muttering about? Harrison would never implicate|himself if anything were to go wrong. We're down to working on secrets|that our government can never admit. Things that could topple|our nation's credibility. What if North Korea knew the kind of|warfare we were trying to perfect? We're giving them a hard time|with the nuclear program... when all the while we're cloning|aliens for military application. Are you telling me that you're|an independent contractor... working with the military|on cloning aliens? You're not a believer. You don't think in this vast|universe another life form exists? One that's more versatile, smart,|dangerous we know humans to be? Every year, hundreds of meteorites|slam into our planet. We found a drop of water on one. You have any idea how|many we never find? How many other drops|of water are out there? O'Brien, you see that? -See what?|-Something tells me we're not alone. -What did you see?|-What do you thing it was? Looks like a guy|about 3O feet ahead. U.S. Army.|Show yourself. Stand up and put your|hands behind your head. -Are you here to help?|-Hands behind your head, now! -I'm a doctor.|-On your knees. I work here. Get you hands on your|head now! Get down! Gun! -Hall's down!|-Check him out! Hall! Hall! Get up, Hall! What's going on back|there, O'Brien? He's got a pulse.|He's alive. The suit is bullet proof all right. The guy though,|where did he go? Freeze! Trainer, did you see that? O'Brien, look out! -Oh my God!|-Something's on my hand! -lt's burning!|-What are you doing? Got to get this off!|It's burning! My hand is burning! -Burning!|-Holy shit, O'Brien! My arm is burning! Holy shit, O'Brien!|Hang on. We got good air.|I'm taking off your helmet. I'm going to stick you. Hang in there. Hall, get your ass over|here now. Hurry up. What happened to her? Come on, we got to get her|out of here right now. Move! Move! We've got a problem. The Captain's been infected.|She needs help, now. -Cole, open the door.|-I won't do that. Help!|Let me in! Cole, you open the door right|now and assist my team. Major, if we let O'Brien|in here she could kill us all. Listen to me!You open the|goddamn door right now! Trainer, tell me what|colour her eyes are. -What?|-Her eyes. What colour are they? They're black. -Black.|-lt's too late. Ross. We're losing her.|You open the door, now! Give me a sec here, Trainer.|I got a situation. We don't have a fucking second.|She's dying! Suit up.|We're taking her topside. We can't do that.|She has been contaminated. Ross, we're losing her.|Open the door!Open it now! O'Brien, this is Ross.|You hang in there, all right? We can't take her|out of the mountain. She'll contaminate every living|organism she comes in contact with. Civilization as we know it,|will no longer exist. We don't have a cure for this thing.|She can't be saved. Get Trainer and Hall as far away|from her as quick as you can. Out there they stand a chance of|becoming exposed themselves. Cole... get out here and fixherup.|She's my partner, do you hear me? Open the door. I said open the goddamn door. Ross, she's been convulsing|ever since she got infected. What did you do, bastard? You shot her, you bastard. Trainer, O'Brien was already dead. What? What? What she was infected|with has no known cure. If we stand out here, we'll have|better chance of becoming infected. No!|I gave her the shoot! -I gave her the shoot!|-She's dead, man. We got to get out of here. That's an order. You killed her!|She covered you ass so many times! -She never would have survived.|-I gave her the shot. I did what I was told... ...and you should fix her up.|-lt should have worked! But it's a different strain|and we have no cure. Now if we get infected,|we die exactly like the same way. This liquid that attacked O'Brien...|Is this our alien? Alien? Like as in the movie? The liquid is a bi-product|of the alien. It's doing exactly what|we designed it to do. -You designed a fucking alien?|-No, we cloned an alien. From a drop of water that was|discovered on a meteorite. Weapons specifically designed|to help preserve the human race. But before we could develop|the counter-inoculation... we had to first create de PB3. In theory we thought that if we|could clone it, we could kill it. And then, we would be ready|in case it ever attacked. You cloned a frigging alien and the|government thought that was OK? It's also extremely intelligent. I'm going to sit down for this. Each time the PB3 encounters|a new organism... the alien's molecular structure|co-ordinates an attack. It essentially consume us... using our mass and our|intelligence to grow... mutating, changing. It can almost go into any|form liquid or human. It has the ability to take the|human host and attain its goal. And what the hell goal is that? It would like to|control the planet. And it was OK to clone something|that could control the planet. That's real smart.|Real smart. And you alien escaped,|start infecting your crew... but somebody caught on|and locked the place down. That seems to be what happened. But the PB3 is reacting unlike|anything we have ever seen before. What it did to O'Brien and Hall,|that's new. It's trying to breach our suits. It's learned to hunt. If this thing gets out,|it will be impossible to stop. We can't let that happen. What do we do to control it? -We have been developing a...|-Cole! I need to show you something. Excuse us. It's the frigging blob. They're in love with this thing. We got to fucking kill it. Harrison convinced me|to take it to the next step. He didn't want me working with|anyone. Classified all my research. -I couldn't even tell you about it.|-What are you talking about? I developed a new strain. -You did what?|-The microbe was just the embryo. There's 3 chromosomes|called X, Y, and Z... and 3 sexes that cross-fertilize|and mutate into a new organism. The Russians couldn't do it,|you couldn't do it, but I did. Oh my God! My God, Peter. Why? You honestly think you could spend|the rest of your life in this hole? I've been here for 5 years.|I want out. I want out. -To do what?|-To publish... to receive the Nobel. -But for what?|-The PB3. But that's impossible. You know it's impossible. For the security issues and|because there's nothing to publish. We still don't know how it works. We can find out how it works. Prove that life exists|outside our world. You have screwed us all. Suit up.|We're leaving. I never signed up to fight|no Martians. Command, this is alpha team.|Command, alpha team reporting. This is Harrison.|Report. Situation. Lang and Cole have identified an|alien species loose down here. -Lang?|-Yes, Colonel. Are you ready to come out? Yes, there's nothing|more I can do here. Cole, how serious is it? -lt's beyond our control, sir.|-Cole, you call it. -I recommend immediate deployment.|-Christ. -Major Ross?|-Sir? Evac your people within 2O minutes.|I'm going to nuke the mountain. Affirmative, sir. -Get your people out of there.|-Thank you, sir. How far are we going|to get in 2O minutes? -Don't you worry.|-But you're gonna nuke the mountain. You can't get away from a|nuclear blast in 2O minutes. This facility is built to contain the|blast. As long as we make it... to an air lock we'll be safe. You see that?|Straight ahead. I see it.|What do you think, Trainer? I think that's the same stuff|that attacked O'Brien. We back track and|we go around. We don't have time. Don't worry.|This is what we do. Trainer, Hall... On my command. Let's see how|this thing responds under fire. This one's for O'Brien. Fire in the hall!|Go! Go! That's great!|We just blew awater cooler. -We got to get out of here.|-Nice shot, bro. Frigging water cooler. This is just wrong. Time is ticking,|we got to go. Stay sharp, Hall. -Can't believe we just did that.|-Goddamn it. A trained Delta force|shooting at awater cooler. What's next?|A killer vending machine? -Can't believe we nailed an alien.|-Stay focused. Get out of here. We're almost there. We got to make it to the elevator. -Trainer, the door. Hall, cover.|-Copy that. Copy that, sir. My God, what's with spiders? -Spiders?|-Cole, watch your... I hate spiders! We have to have control of the|elevator. It's the only way out! Activate fire on the elevator! Clear the elevator! Ross, behind you! -Where are they all coming from?|-Lang, watch out! Lang, are you OK? -There's too many of them!|-Ross, they're on your feet! I got'em. Trainer, 12 o'clock. Hall, watch out! Just keep firing, Hall. I don't know what to do.|My God! It's a nightmare, man.|It's a nightmare! -I don't know what to do.|-Don't! Fire in the hole! Everyone, back up.|Is anyone hit? Hall, what were you thinking? -I'm going to get out of here.|-You just sealed our only exit. -There's got to be stairs.|-There's no stairs. -He's going to save us, right?|-I wouldn't count on it. Fall back, everyone!|Fall back! -Hall, have you lost your mind?|-There's got to be another way out. I sure hope so. First we've got to|get to the lab and stop the nuke. -Shit, I forgot about the nuke!|-We're screwed. Command, this is alpha team. Ross, you'd better|be in that elevator. Elevator is negative for evac, sir.|Hostiles in control. -Harrison, stop the nuke.|-The count is at OO:O3:4O. Any chance you can make|the auxiliary air lock? Negative, sir.|There's not enough time. You'll have to re-set it manually. We can handle the manual|detonation on this end. Susan, you know what this means. -Yes, sir.|-lt's your call. Don't worry.|I'll handle it. All right, I'll stop the count. Come on! Ok. We're here. The bomb fuse is 5 levels below. The auxiliary air lock is about|3OO yards down the passage way. Peter! Stand back.|Nobody touch him. Peter! Peter! What the fuck is that? Jesus Christ! Where's the fuck it go? Peter! Oh, God! He's dead. Put your helmets on.|We have to get out of here. Cole, you have anything|that can fight this thing? Yeah, I think I do. Ross, we got to go. This weapon has been designed|for close range combat. Fresh off the assembly line.|They've never been tested on either. Wait a minute. We're going to|be the first ones to use them? That's right. These are warheads, gentlemen,|and they contain a gas... design to kill aspecific|breed of alien. You'll be fighting a new strain|but, hopefully, it should work. We have to get these toxins|out of the warheads... and into these|canisters to load the guns. Piece of cake. The toxin was designed to infect|those who have not been inoculated. I hope you don't|mind needles. Shouldn't I get another warhead? Back over by the sink. There's a case on top,|be careful. Doc, what do you make of this? -Oh, God! Oh, God!|-What? Everyone out! Out! Get out, Ross! Jesus!|Cole, what's going on? We got to get out now!|Come on, let's go. Let's move! Shit, shit, shit. -What happened to him, Cole?|-The toxin. -He's dead.|-Cole, answer me. Oh, God... Our helmets. The air quality is not good. We have|to make it to a secure air lock. Let's get out of here. Lang is dead.|We just lost Hall. -Have you reset bomb?|-Not yet. We're on our way. Cole, we might be soon facing an|invasion. We need to be prepared. Langfollowed orders|you wouldn't. You shouldn't let moral judgement|interfere with your work. Harrison, we'll set that nuke,|but that PB3 experiment ends here. -That ends now.|-This is on your head. -Cole.|-It's your decision, Cole. Are we facing a goddamn invasion? It this thing gets out,|we're facing extinction. How long can we stay|exposed to this air? Long enough to make it|to the next air lock it we're lucky. Cole! More frigging spiders. What the frig is that? Go! Ross, let's go! -What the hell is that thing?|-Run! -Cole? What is that?|-Hurry up! Not enough air in here.|Just get to the air lock. I'm slowing it down,|but I'm not stopping it. -Oh, no! The keypad's not working!|-Let me at it. -Cole, cover Trainer.|-I got it. -Trainer?|-I'm working on it. -Trainer. C4.|-lt'll be close. Come on, come on. -I got it. It's open.|-Go. Go, go. My God. You guys OK? Yeah, you? I'm cool. It's not every day you almost|get killed by an alien. Let's go. Be careful out there. Any more surprises waiting|for us down here, Cole? I sure hope not.|But we should expect the worse. Was that your missing|experiment back there? I don't know what that was. Maybe it's some sort of mutation. You're learning quick, Major. -Let's just get this over with.|-Sounds good to me. -Everybody watch their backs.|-Let's do this. The bomb is in here. The air lock|is at the other end of the tunnel. We part company here. I'll set the bomb|and meet you guys outside. That's too risky.|We stay together. Ross and I are going to cover|the door. You're going to go in... and set the timer then we|all go to the air lock. OK. -Great.|-They're guarding the bomb. -They know we're trying to kill'em.|-How do you want to handle this? Very slowly towards the detonator|and hope for the best. -This isn't going to be easy.|-There's so many of them. -Easy...|-They appear to be dormant. -Easy...|-No sudden movements. We should be OK.|Let's get this done and get out. Watch your step. -Cover my back, Ross.|-I've got your back. So far, so good. -Oh, my God!|-Trainer? -Look out!|-Cole, look out! Trainer, double time. Trainer, come on! Ross, behind you!|Look out! Trainer, come on! Trainer, hurry up! Faster! Let's get out of here. Go, go! Come on! Trainer! Ross! The timer is toast.|I can't get it to work. -What?|-lt doesn't work. The detonator? The detonator will work... but I got to arm it manually. No. It's my responsibility.|I'll do it. I'll give you enough|time to get out. You're the only who knows how|to fight this thing if it gets out. -Sir?|-Get her to the exit. -No, Major.|-That's an order. Yes, sir. You'll die. I've got no one waiting|for me topside... besides how often does a guy|get a chance to save the world? I'm so sorry. Me too. -Trainer.|-Sir? Get this to Harrison. My final order|and I'd like to make good on it. Yes, sir.|Ross... you're a brave man. -Go on, get out of here.|-Yes, sir. Let's go! Cole, look out! Go! Where the hell are they? Oh shit! Easy... Trainer, I'm down. -You go. I'll set the bomb.|-No. This is my responsibility. Not an option, OK? -Trainer...|-I'm not going to argue with you. It's what I do. That's my job. Go on.|Get out of here. Wait.|Wait a minute. Ross... what do you want to do with this? That ends here. I knew you're going to say that. Get the hell off him. Die, you alien scum! Die! Oh, fuck... -I love you, mommy.|-I love you, baby. Are you OK? You all right? The others? They didn't make it. Did you secure sample? You know I couldn't do that. Your helmet?|It's gone. You expect me to believe that? You're telling me astory that you|couldn't possibly have witnessed. You were left behind,|you were left for dead. It was the right thing to do. I would have infected the team.|It was dangerous to keep me around. But I followed them out,|I witnessed everything. How did you get out, if Cole|was the last one in that air lock? Did you witnesses that explosion?|The nuke would've killed everything. But you survived. -Yes, I did.|-How? Isn't it obvious? I had to survive... to keep my species alive. Do you believe in me now? Captain... we need to get our guest|to the White House. CAPTlONS BY VlDEOLAR
