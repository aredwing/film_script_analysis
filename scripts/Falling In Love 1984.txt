Let's get drunk. - Are you crazy? - I just feel good, that's all. My car broke down, I got in late, I missed Jay and I have these revisions for him.

It's no big deal. It was coming. I've been seeing Carol over a year now. It's no secret. I figure the kids, you know, so we stuck it out. This is better. It's honest, at least. - I'm sorry. - You are? - Yeah. - Why? I don't know. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Where are you going? - Acapulco.

We have this dinner every year. Well, he's still my husband. Sort of. And it's important to him. So, listen. I'll call you when I get back. You can show me your tan. I'm not going down there to get a tan. - Bye, Molly. - Bye. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. - There you go. - No, none for me. No? No coffee, no booze, no cigarettes. - My assets are dwindling. - You're not missing anything. - Only pleasure. - Come on, Daddy. - It's only a flu. - The bubonic plague was only a flu. - Have you seen a doctor? - I am a doctor! - I could call George. - I'm fine. If you discount the angina, the migraines and the gastritis, there's nothing wrong with me. Here you go. Sure you don't wanna come home with me? - Christmas in the suburbs? No. - Why not? - I'd spoil it. - I know. But come anyway. I'll be fine. I'm such a pain in the ass these days I deserve myself. What are you doing? - Looking for a match. - I can't believe this. You devil! Thank you. Sir, wait a minute. You forgot something. Thanks. Excuse me. Sorry. Shoot. - Sorry. - I'll get it. I made it worse. Can I throw that? You don't mind? - I don't know. - Come on. Just go ahead. - You want a bag? - This last-minute shopping... - I have an extra bag. Take this. - You sure? - That's all right. - Thanks a lot. Watch your step. - I'm sorry. - I'll give you a hand. Don't worry. That's all right. Thanks. Just put it on top, if you would. Thanks. - Here. - Thanks a lot. - Good. - Thank you. Thanks a lot. It's OK. Got it? Wait a minute! Excuse me!

I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake. Come on, come on. You guys... Come on! Out! 20 more minutes. And don't open the presents yet! Don't go downstairs! Merry Christmas. Don't you want to open your present? I wanna know whose idea it was to have children. - I know. Yours. - It was yours. God. I must have been out of my mind. Let's get this show on the road. Oh, my God. - No good? - My God, no. This is beautiful. - You like it? - Yeah, this is really beautiful. You can exchange it. It's quite a surprise. I... I wasn't expecting anything so romantic. Thank you. - Merry Christmas. You like it? - Yes. And this is for you. - Careful, guys. - It'll be broken by dinner. Try to keep all the pieces together, OK? So I don't have to look for them. I just have to put this one on. Is that the right one? - What's this? - Open it up. - No, you're not right! - What did I just tell you? Take the decals and put them in one spot. Put 'em in one spot. I am putting them in one spot. I don't get it. - What's this? - It's lovely. We can exchange it. Thanks. I didn't get this, I got a book on gardening. Everybody, let's clean up this mess! Gardens For All Seasons. What is that? Oh, no. Well, it's a very nice book. I'm sorry! - It is. - Honey, it's a mistake. There was a man in the store... God. Never mind. I'll just take it back. - I'll take this sweater back too. - No, I told you, I like it. - You'll never wear it. - Yeah, you're right. - But it'll look great on you. - That's why I bought it. Anyway, it's the thought that counts. That's what I mean. I'll take it back. - God. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - We better get dressed. - Why? Irene and Phil. Yeah. Right. Oh, no. When? Brunch. Oh, no. - Come on. It'll be fun. - No, it won't. You're right, it won't. I'll call them. I'll call them and cancel. No, I just thought we could spend the day together. For once. Irene, hi. Brian. Yeah, Merry Christmas. It's all right. If you want to. Listen, Molly wants to talk to you. - I said it's all right. - It's up to you. You can tell her, go ahead. Hi, Irene, it's me. No, I think it's a great idea. I do. What time is good for you? Thanks a lot. Will it be ready by tomorrow? Give me a call. All tickets. All tickets, please. All tickets. Thank you. Thank you very much. - Rizzoli's. - What? - The bookstore. Rizzoli's. - I'm sorry. I was trying to remember where I saw you. The books. My God. I dropped everything. You helped me. Oh, yes! Yes, I remember you. I kept looking at you. I knew I knew you from somewhere. Yeah. You had all the packages. - Yeah. I took yours. - Yes, right. I still have it, you know. It's still there. Boats - yours was boats. Yeah, I liked it. It was good. - Anyway, I'm glad I remembered. - I'm glad you remembered too. Very nice to see you again. I better... It was nice to see you. By the way, merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Oh, yeah. Merry Christmas. We were talking about Houston. - Texas. - Right. - Where the hell are you? - I was thinking about something. Think about Houston. Six months, seven at the outside. A year at least. - Come in, Frank. - I'm on eight. I'll be right down. - No way, it's the same building. - I can't, Vic, I have family. - You can find somebody there. - There's nobody. - There's money, work. - I'm not finished here. - I need you there. - Let me think about it. - Say yes. Think about it later. - That's a commitment. - You're a pain in the ass. - But I'm worth it. - Think about it, will you? - All right. All right! - What's the problem? - It's this seal here. - We got to cut this pipe. - Who authorised that? This afternoon after four o'clock. No, no. Grand Central to Dobbs Ferry. Yeah. Yeah. Wait a minute. OK, that's good. Thanks. Hi! You asleep? - It's you. - What? - Hi. - I'm not awake. - Go back to sleep. - No, no, no. You been here long? No. Just walked in. - So what'd they say? - Your mother... - What? - The flowers. Every day. She said they made her happy. Yeah, well, I don't remember her that way. I remember the fights. I remember the times I was afraid to come into the house. But I don't really remember happy. You were too young. So? Going home Friday? I think I'll stay here for the weekend, torture the nurses. What happened? They do the tests? It's the same story. I'm just two years older. So why are they keeping you here? I don't know. I guess I'm an interesting specimen. How do I get a straight answer out of you? Talk to my doctor. I worry about you, that's all. I'm waiting for the sugar. It's right in front of you. What's the matter? Nothing. I'm just having a nervous breakdown. You deserve a nervous breakdown. What have you been doing to yourself? The worst weekend of my entire life. - What happened? - Everything. Carol and I were supposed to go away for the weekend. Friday, my wife calls. Can we take the kids? She's not well. So we cancel the weekend, take the kids to a movie. We run into my wife. She's with some man. I get pissed off, my wife gets embarrassed, the kids are confused. Carol hits the ceiling and throws me out. Saturday night, I'm on the street with two kids, three suitcases and a dog. She wants to get married. - You can't, you're not divorced yet. - I know, I know. Some men are smarter about cheating. Like you, you're smarter. - Not smart, I just don't cheat. - I know. See? Smarter. I met a woman on the train this morning. I don't wanna get married again but I don't like being alone. What did she look like? The woman on the train. I don't know. He looked nice. He looked sort of... familiar. That's it? That's the whole story? You met him at Rizzoli's three months ago and again on the train? Yeah, except... just for a minute I thought... I thought... It was really nothing and I just, you know, something. Sure. This is nice. When did you do these? These are recent. This is, like, last couple of weeks. You don't want me to show these to anybody? Not yet, anyway. No. What's his name? I don't know, I didn't ask her. - Why not? - I wasn't trying to pick her up. You're incompetent. You're incompetent! You make everything about sex, you realise that? Everything. - I do my best. - It's just a little funny story. I mean, Jesus, I'm really sorry I mentioned it. Let's just forget it. What are you gonna do about it? What's the worst thing that could happen? Just do it. What do I do, hang around Grand Central Station then hand her some line? Take her to a hotel? Take her to my apartment. I'm not using it. The sheets are clean. Hi, how are you? Yeah, hi. Yeah, hi. Well, hello. What a surprise to see you. I just happen to be taking the same train. Where you going? You work in the city? This is ridiculous. What am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing? Sorry. Excuse me. There are some seats in the back. No. Hi. No, it's all right. I'm fine. - I saw you... - No, I'm the next stop. Yeah, after this one. - We're neighbours. - Yeah? - Frank Raftis. - Hello again. Margaret Gilmore. Well, Molly. - You work in the city? - No. I'm married. I mean, no, I don't work. I mean, I do work but I'm not now. I do commercial art. Graphics, ads, freelancing. It's not... - Do you? - Work? In the city? No. My dad's been sick. He's been in and out of the hospital. - I'm sorry to hear that. - He's OK. I've just... been going in a lot to see him, and... - I thought about you today. - You did? Yeah, I mean, about seeing you again. I mean, after so many months. Yeah. I know, that was funny. - I'm married too. - Well, lots of people are. - I guess so. - Is your wife the gardener? Yeah, she is. Dobbs Ferry, The next station stop is Dobbs Ferry. This is you. Listen, are you... Will you be coming in tomorrow? No. I mean, I'm not... This is not... I wasn't trying to, you know. Yes, I know. I thought maybe we could ride in together. Dobbs Ferry. Please exit through the rear doors. Rear doors only. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, you know... Friday. I think I'm coming in Friday. - Friday? - On the 9:04, I usually... - This Friday? - Yes. - Bye. - Bye. Ardsley will be your next stop! Ardsley in three minutes. Come on, you guys, I've had it. It's been all day. Sit down. - Listen to your mother. - Your car's ready, they called. - Can we have Burger King? - How much is it gonna cost? I was afraid to ask. We could pick it up on the way home. We'll leave it, I think. I'll just pick it up on the weekend. Come on. Let's go back. Sit down. Dad's tired. You can give him a hug when we get home. - Fries and chicken! - Sit down! My turn. I think it's my turn. Gosh. - Where are you? - I don't know. - Well, I'm turning in. - Yeah. I'll be right up. Did you let the dog out? Yes. He's back. Want me to drive? - What's the matter? - It's getting late. Why didn't you take an earlier train? You were up. I just don't want to miss the train. - Is this seat taken? - Yes. I mean, yes. Yes, it is taken. - I didn't see you. - I almost missed the train. Mike is six. Joe is four. No. No, no. He's five. Five now. What am I talking about? Five last January. We took him to the city for his birthday because the circus was in town. Course, we have to do the same thing for the other one for his birthday. - Does he get jealous a lot? - Mike? Yeah, all the time. - At that age, you know. - Yeah. And he's older. - Isn't he? - Yeah. They like to compete. Sure. The little one, though, is smart, too. He's like his mother. He sees things. He's quick. He's fast. Mike is more like me. He's a little... Well... I don't know. I can up the fee, they'll throw in a house. You'll be back in a year. - I don't think so, Vic. - What are you holding out for? I just don't want to go to Houston. There's a great opportunity here. Let's talk about it later, I have to make a call now. Seymore fell down! Hello. Yes. Hi. Yes. Yeah... Well, yes. Sure. Bye. - So, I was in the neighbourhood. - So you said. - How's your father? - He's OK. - He's coming home in a few days. - Good. I know I said we could have coffee but I was thinking... Well, maybe if we... If you had time, we could have lunch or something. Lunch? Yeah, that... Well... I don't know. I mean... - You're very beautiful. - No, I'm not. - I'm very married. - I am too. But married people have to eat too. Yes, they do. - Yeah? - Sure. The city was Dutch then and they were expecting an attack from the English in New England so they built a wall for protection but the bids from the private contractors were too high, so the people built it themselves. It ran from the East River straight to the Hudson, straight across. That's why they call it Wall Street. How do you know all that? I read it on the back of this menu. So what happened? Did they attack, the English? Yeah. But they came from the south. They came by boat so it was useless. - The wall. - Yeah. - I'm talking too much. - No, you're not. At least I'm talking. You're just sitting there. It's true. I'll shut up. You talk. Well, what do you want to know? How much do you weigh? - Hey, Ed. - Yeah, what? Can I ask you something? Tell me the truth. What? Do you think I'm good-looking? No, we knew... we knew before she was born, so... They... There was an abnormality in the blood vessels so they had to operate right away. And she was five days old. That was a year ago. That was two years ago in March. It was nobody's fault but Brian, he's a doctor... It's harder. I thought that we should have had another one right away. I thought we should have. But you didn't. No but we will, I think we will. It's just time. Yeah. Kids. Yeah. We should go. Yeah. You wanna have another coffee? Wait! No, this one. Where you going? I don't know what you've been up to but you look terrific. I do? Well, I... I feel good. I've been working a lot more and... I just feel good. - I haven't seen you for weeks. - Yeah, I know. - Who is it? - Who is what? Well, you're seeing someone, aren't you? My God, what time is it? I just... - I have to run. - We're having lunch. - Sorry, I just can't. - What's going on? He's a friend, that's all. We take the train together and... and I like him. He makes me feel good. I like being with him and I like thinking about him. We just do things, you know, we... We laugh, I mean mostly at... I hardly even know him. That's the truth. I just like being with him, that's all. I like... God. I'm gonna go. - Molly, listen to me. - I don't want to listen. Sorry. I'm not gonna listen. I'm going. I'll call you. Hi. It's me. Yes. Hi. Yes, I decided to. Where? Sure. Bye. What? - You look different. - I do? You look nice, you just look different. You look great. Maybe it's the jacket. I had a feeling you were gonna call. - Well, shall we go...? - Yeah. Thank you. - I know how to cook Chinese. - You do? No kidding. No, really. Moo shu pork. You just get the buttermilk pancake mix. You're putting me on. You can't beat this guy. There's no way. - The bird wins. You lose. - I can't believe it. Try again. There you go. It's unfair, he goes ahead. You should flip for it. See who goes first. He's saying, "hurry up." - I got to go here. - He's beating you again. It's OK. Bird wins. I'll try... - I look surprised. - You look great. I look terrible. At least yours look like you. - This looks like me? - Yeah. - I look like this? - Yeah. This isn't... this is not the way I look. Yes, it is. - Jesus. - They're nice. Let me see. What? Nothing. The Shaffer woman died today. Oh, no. The husband was there. I made my little speech. He kept looking at me. They always look at you as if you should have more to say. Would you like to go to the movies? No. Going into town tomorrow? - We already did the arteriogram. - You did? - Yes. He didn't tell you? - No, he didn't. He's been avoiding this for six months. We'd like to keep him and do the bypass but he has to agree to it. Well, I'll talk to him. He's pretty groggy right now. I know. I just want to... I just want to see him. Dr Gilmore, please. It's his wife. Yeah. No, that's OK. No. No message. Thank you. - You OK? - Yes. - You sure? - Yes. I'm fine. - Isn't that Roosevelt Island? - Yeah. - What's the matter? - What? You're thinking about something. - It looks easy from here. - What does? Everything. - You want to go back? - No. Yes. Yes, I have to go back. I shouldn't have called you. I'm sorry. My father's in the hospital again. That's all. I just... They have to operate. No, that's not it. - It's this. - What? I have to go. I do. - Why? - I can't do this. I can't. I don't know why I called you. I didn't mean to, I just did. Stupid. - Don't say that. - I didn't want to see you. Don't say that. I have a husband. I have... I have a life. I have things that I... I have to be there. I have to go. I do. Wait for me at the station. 5:45. University Hospital, please. Wait for me? Yeah, I know that. Yeah, I know that. I know that but nobody else seems to know that. No, I'm just tired of saying the same thing over and over. I'm looking at it right now. What do you want me to do? Well, what do you want me to do? Look, I can't talk now. I'm sorry, I can't. I can't! I can't! I'm hanging up right now. I'm hanging up. Taxi! Taxi! You came. I didn't think you were coming. I love you. I do. Hi. I'm almost done. Dinner will be ready soon. No hurry. I left the tickets for tomorrow on the hallway table. - What tickets? - You're taking the kids to the game. - No. I can't. - Why not? - Well... - You forgot? - I'm stuck with Victor tomorrow. - That's OK. - Damn. - It's OK. I told them you might have to work. Don't worry about it. I'll take 'em. - Sorry. - It's OK. I want to take 'em. I do. I was even kind of hoping it might turn out like this. What's the matter? I was thinking about Ed Lasky. He's getting a divorce. - Surprise, surprise. - He says he's not in love any more. Nobody's in love any more. So what else is new? Yeah. I'll be inside. This is very... Eleanor Roosevelt. Oh, no. My God. What are you doing? What are you doing? - Hi. - Hi. I came in the back door. I'm late. I was late getting started. - I didn't see you. - I was waiting out front. - There? I should have looked. - It was just a few minutes. Anyway. How are you? You look nice. - You wanna go? - Where? I don't know. You wanna get something to eat? - Sure. - You hungry? No but, I mean, if you're hungry... No, I'm not... I'm not hungry. I was thinking about you. No, I'm fine. Listen, I... - Go ahead. - I was just gonna... Well, I was... I was just thinking. - Go on, what is it? - Maybe this isn't such a good idea. It's OK, I was thinking the same thing. - You were? - Yeah, I was. I would have called you but how could I? - I just felt, you know... - I know. You wanna go? I have a place we can go. It's nice. - Yeah. It's dark. - Yeah. I'm sorry. I can't. I'm sorry. I can't. Dobbs Ferry is our next station stop. Dobbs Ferry. Will I see you tomorrow? And then what? Once a week? Twice a week? Then what? Daddy! What is it? What? The hospital called an hour ago. It's such a beautiful day, isn't it? I don't think I can remember such a beautiful day. Trainer, T-R-A-l-N-E-R. John Trainer. He was in room 709 but he's not there any more. No? You're sure? No, no, I'm just a friend. Thank you. For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen. Almighty God, the god of the spirits of all flesh, who, by a voice from heaven, didst proclaim, "blessed are the dead, who die in the Lord. "Multiply, we beseech Thee. "To those who rest in Jesus, "the manifold blessings of Thy love, "that the good work which Thou didst begin in them may be made perfect "unto the day of Jesus Christ." Come on, darling. - Come on, please. - No! I don't wanna go! - Molly, let's go home. - No! No! No! No! I can't! - Molly, Molly! Easy! Easy! - No, please. Take it easy, Molly! Come on. Come on, sweetheart. - Don't hold me. - Let's sit down. Don't touch me! Calm down! Settle down! Settle down. Settle down. Listen to me. You're going to be all right. All right? Easy. No. I think about him every day. Last thought before I fall asleep... and first thought when I wake up. I talk to myself all day about him. Even when I'm talking to somebody else, even talking to you now. I talk to myself about him. Brian thinks I'm ill, he thinks it has to do with my father. He thinks the stress and... you know, all that. Thinks I'm having a breakdown but I'm not, there's nothing wrong with me. Except that I love him. Molly, listen... No, I know that you don't approve. I don't approve either. I agree with you but that doesn't change it. I should have slept with him, maybe that would have made it easier. I just think we were meant to be together, even though we never will be. I just think it's the right thing. I just think... Everything else is wrong. I'm sorry. - Boy, it's late. - I know. - You must be exhausted. - Yeah. I'm tired. - I saved you some supper. - No. It's late. No, it's ready. Sit down. It's good to see you. - Kids OK? They asleep? - Yeah. Listen, I talked to Vic tonight. I told him yes about Houston. Well... That's good. It's OK with you? What does it mean? When and all that? - As soon as we can. - All of us? School's gonna be a problem for the kids. Well, we'll figure something out. Would you rather we didn't come? Would you rather go alone? No. No. - Are you sure? - Sure I'm sure. I'm fine, thanks. What's going on? With us, I mean. What's the matter? What is it, Frank? It's nothing. Oh, Christ. - It's nothing. - No, please don't say "nothing". It's hard enough just to ask. You can at least, for Christ's sake... lie to me. I'm not an idiot. Don't tell me "nothing". Ann, I can't. All right. Never mind. We'll go to Houston. Fine, fine, we'll all go to Houston. I can hardly wait. I met a woman on a train. I don't know... Nothing happened. I mean, we didn't... We never, you know... It's over now. Nothing happened. I'm not seeing her, I'm not having an affair. It's nothing like that. No... No, it's worse, isn't it? Look, I'm going to take a couple of weeks. I'll take the kids. We'll go to Denver to see my mother. And then we'll see. No, I'm all packed and ready to go. You miss me? What do you mean "no"? What kind of answer is that? Well, how's your grandmother? Well, give her a hug for me, OK? A what? No, not a bug, dummy, a hug. A hug! I'll see you in a couple of days. I love you. Bye. Hi. Yeah, I'm just waiting for the taxi. Yeah, yeah. I did switch 'em off. Ann, I wanted to ask you something. Yeah, all right. All right. All right. I'll call you as soon as I get there. OK, bye. Yeah, yeah. I will. All right. If I can find it. I will, if I can find it, all right? OK. Bye. Oh, Ann! Brian, you gonna get that? Bri! Hello. Hello. Hello? Yes, hi. No. No, I... A bath, I was just going to take a bath. Where are you? Are you all right? Is anything wrong? Yeah, yeah, I miss you. You do? Well, I miss you. I miss you too. Well, I'm going away. I'm going away. I'm going to Houston. I'm leaving tonight. I'm leaving in a few minutes. Now. Where are you now? Home, my house. How have you been? Terrible. Yeah. Well, listen... Christ, why do people say "listen" on the telephone? What else you gonna do? I wanna see you. Can I see you before I go? I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't call you, I know that I'm... What? Please, just... I only have a few minutes. I don't want to go. I'm turning off lights in here, I don't know. Please, could I see you? Could I just see you? Frank, I... - You did get it. - Yeah, I got it. It's for me. Can you talk? What? Yeah. Look, just come over. I'm on Bradley, it's right off Clinton. You know where it is. It's 421 Bradley. I'll wait for you. Yeah, look, I just... Thanks for calling me and I really hope that everything works out for you. That's all. What do you mean? Goodbye. Well, that's done. - I'm gonna go see him. - What are you doing? He's going away. I won't be long. - Why are you doing this? - I just wanna say goodbye. - Brian, please. - Listen... - Please! - He's going. That's it. - That's the end of it! - I have to go. Hi. These over here. - Wait, I'll be right back. - Sure. Hello. Yeah, is Molly there, please? - Who is this? - I'd like to speak to her if... Look, don't call here. Why are you calling here?
