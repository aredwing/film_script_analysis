Hey Chris. - Dylan, you look worse than me. - Can't get a hold of these hours. - You got the rap group, Killer Kane on the sixth floor already causing trouble, one guest VIP, Amber Strong, adult film star. - She's VIP? - Her money says she is. - What's the count? - Negative 16. - Are you fucking kidding me? Hey, put your food order in. What's the average no shows lately? - Holding around 5%. You got 600 rooms, 30 guests, you should be fine. - Fucking reservations assholes. They sell 616 rooms 'cause they're not here when the hotel is filled up and you gotta walk a guest. - Preaching to the choir, brother. I worked night shift for five years. You got it. - Ah, yes. Here you go. - Did you put your food in? - I will in a bit. Who's the bellman? - Rico. - I wonder if that was Linda's first time tonight? Rico! - Jerrod! How you feeling, sir? - Hot! - How bout you, Dyl? - Feel like I still can't get used to these hours. - You try what I said? - Yeah, yeah. I got home at seven, and I didn't go to sleep until 1 pm. - How long did you sleep? - I slept til nine. - Well, you should be well rested, then. - Nah, I don't think it works for me, man. Tonight as soon as I get home, I'm going to sleep. - It's your call, but you been on nights what, three months? I been on it seven years. - C'mon Jerrod, call it in. - What is your deal with the food order? - The kitchen's been giving me shit because we're making 'em stay late. - Tell 'em to go fuck themselves. - Yeah, then you would go home and we'd have nothing to eat. C'mon, go. Where's Marco? - I think a guest called him up to his room. - So he's gonna leave the front desk? - It's Marco. - Lisa, can I get a burger, medium? Thank you. - Ah, let me guess, assholes starting early tonight? - Mr. Capso in 305 says his air conditioning is too loud. - So let's transfer him. - He's in a one bedroom suite. All of them are booked. - I'll call Dylan. Hey Dyl, we need you back. Thank you. - Can I help you? - Are you the manager? - Yes, I am. - I need a new friggin room. - And why is that? - Air conditioning's too freaking loud. - I'll send Pablo up to take a look at it. - Your boy Marco was already up. - Marco's not the repairman. - Just give me a new friggin room. - Sir, there are no other one bedroom suites available. I could give you a room with a king size bed. - I'll take a two bedroom suite. - None available. - You know what, fine. I want a refund; I'm going to another hotel. - Okay, you can speak to Brad, he's the reservations manager, he's on Monday through Friday, 9 am to 5 pm. - Fuck you. - I'll send a bellman up to help you with your bags. - Fuck all you. I don't need help. - Bring up his account. I'm praying, truly. - Score. He rented one last night. - What's it called? - Balls in Play. - Sir? Remember to bring down the adult DVD you rented, I think it was called Balls in Play? You gotta bring that down, sir. - Love the fact that we hand deliver all of our DVDs. - It's a little outdated, but it's a touch of class from the Century Grand. - Check this guy out. - Sir, can I help you? - Yeah, lost something. - What'd you lose? - Lost my dick. - How're you gonna find it? - Find it up my girlfriend's ass. - Okay sir, thank you for letting us know. - Sure. - Seemed like a nice guy. - Yeah. - Hey sweetie. - Hey Linda, how are things? - Eh, they're slow. - What you got? - Euro. Swedish dude. Thanks sweetie. You have a good one. - You too. Yen? - No, euros, why? - It's usually yen, right? - Those Japanese businessmen love their hookers. - Hey, hey. Linda's a high-priced call girl. I forgot. That's how hotel management wants us to refer to her as we turn the other cheek. - I always ask her how her night's going. She always says the same thing: slow. No matter how many times she goes up and down that elevator to service some guy, she says it's slow. I'm dying to find out what a busy night is for her. - Dylan, you didn't say hi to me. - I saw you banging the phones. - They call all at the same time. Hey, Jerrod. - You sure you don't want to date her? - Positive. - I love how you get all serious. You should give her a shot. - She has crazy eyes. - She has pretty eyes. - Crazy eyes. Trust me. - You tired? - Yeah. Yeah. - Linda wants to exchange more money. - I'm kidding. Fucking with you, bro. Go back to sleep. - I don't know, I just feel better. You know? Maybe not on the inside, but just knowing that I made a choice, you know? Knowing that you're not a victim, you're not weak, you know, something like that. - Hola, Seorita, how are you tonight? Mr. Dylan, so good to see you again. - Hi, Enrique. - Enjoy it. - You shot up again, didn't you? Dammit, Rachel, we're supposed to be in this together. I just, We can do this, believe it. Together, please. Dammit, why won't you believe it? Dammit, why? - Dylan! Dylan, we got a problem. - What is it? Holy shit. Ma'am? Ma'am, ma'am? What happened? Call 911, now! Jerrod! No no no, don't touch her. Don't touch her. Ma'am, did someone do this to you? - My name is Holly. My boyfriend beat me up. - Where is he now? - Room 618. - Okay, call Jeff security, go. Holly is there, is there anything we should, no wait, call Pablo. Okay no, just do it, do it, do it. - He just walked up. - Pablo, you have the gloves, the plastic gloves? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Gimme 'em. C'mon, now! Holly, everything's gonna be okay, all right? - Oh, fuck. - Yeah. Get that guy out of the lobby. Shit's about to go down, all right? Holly, okay, I'm here. It's okay. - I called him twice, no answer. - Candice, come here. Pablo, give a pair of gloves to Candice. Please, Candice. I'm going to have Candice take you to the bathroom and get you cleaned up. Okay? Call him again. - C'mon bro, get up. Hey, you're cute. - Get up. Go to your room. Can't sleep in the lobby. Go to your room. - Hey, Rico, chill. - Sorry, Dyl. - Security's still not here. - All right. Uh, Okay, 618, bring him down, no violence, do not touch him. I mean it. Go. - You know how to get to the China Club? - You're a guest here? - Yeah. - What room? - 642. - You go to 46th Street, make a right, it's a half a block. - All right, thanks buddy. - Hey, you in charge here? - Yes, I'm Dylan Barrick, I'm the overnight manager. - Did you call it in? - No, my operator Candice did. - Where's the girl? - She's in the bathroom with Candice. This girl walks in the lobby, and her face is a mask of blood. It turns out her boyfriend beat her up. - Where's he? - Room 618, I got two of my staff escorting her down. - How bad? - Oh, it's bad. Oh, hey Jeff, nice of you to show up. - Ah man, we had some shit going on. - Who's this? - This is our security guard, Jeff. He wasn't here; he had some shit going on. This girl, - Did you get a name? - Holly. - What is it? - Let's just say I'm not 100% sure she's his girlfriend. - What do you think, call girl? - Well I was wearing gloves, and I got my operator Candice doing the same thing. - Fuck you think you're going, bro? - Jerrod, ease up. This is Jerrod Percy, he's our front desk agent. This is Rico Taylor, he's one of our bellmen. - Well, it's good to see you, Jeff. Glad you took your fucking time. When we got up there, he was packed and headed for the stairs. - Fuck you, man. I had shit to do. - Enough. - What's your name? - Davis Riley. - What happened? - We got in a fight. - Dylan. - Cuff him. - Let's go. - Mr. Barrick. Mr. Barrick? - Yeah? Yeah? - We're gonna need to get a statement from you. All right? - Okay. Yeah. Whatever it takes. I gotta go check that room. No! Hello? Okay. Yeah. - She says he took her money. - Shit. - What is wrong with you? - I was up all night. - Yeah, you're the night shift manager. - It was a tough night, asshole. - Hey, don't you talk that way to me. - Back the fuck off, Henry. - Guys. C'mon. - I don't know what to tell you, Chris. Yeah, he might have come to the desk, asked for the safety deposit box, but he had a key. I mean, how do I know whose money it is? - I'll tell her to file a police report. - How much money did she say he took? - Try four grand. - He had a key. - I can't believe I'm here on my day off. I can't get away from this place. When did all this happen? - 30 minutes ago. Right when I came in to relieve Henry. The girl from last night... - Wait, Holly? Is she here? - She said she checked in and deposited the money before she went upstairs. - Did the police find out if she's a working girl? - Turns out she really is his girlfriend. - Let's go talk to her. - Ma'am? We believe you're gonna have to file a police report. - I can't do that. - Your boyfriend had a key, you both checked in, he was able to retrieve the money. - I just want my money back. - I'm sorry, but we don't have it. - Please give it to me? - Sister, you need to lower your voice. - Hey, back the fuck off, Henry. - Don't you yell at me. - I'm sorry, would you give us a moment, please? Guys, come on. Don't ever pull that shit in front of a customer. I don't care what you two have between... - I'm sorry, Chris. - Help me. - Yo, you lost, bro? - What's that? - Yo, give me your motherfucking money, motherfucker. - Yo, fuck you man. - No, fuck you. It's so great being with you, Rachel. I love you so much. - Mr. Dylan. I have not seen you around here for so long. How have you been? - I'm good, Enrique, good. - And how is your girl, eh? - We're not together anymore. - Oh. Oh, I am so sorry to hear that. But good to see you, seor. - So you are saying he took her money? - She's saying he gave her the money. - What do you think about it all? - What happened? The guy's a piece of shit, he got drunk and he beat up his girl. - So what are you doing here? - This girl Holly, you know, I just feel bad for her. I want to see if maybe there's a way I can help her out. - What happened to your hand? - Some guy tried to mug me. - How'd you do? - I kicked his ass. - So this girl, Holly, she'd have to come down and fill out a report. - I figured as much. But I'm thinking maybe I can get her full name and her address? - For what reason? - You know man, I just want to check up on her, make sure she's okay. Well we wouldn't have her address, just his. And wouldn't you have the same information from when he checked into your hotel? - Yeah, we might. - So just get it there. - Yeah, I'm here now. You know, I'm thinking I might want to stay away from that place for a day or two. - What are you gonna do with his address? - Look man, I'm just gonna check up on her. I feel a little responsible, and I just want to make sure she's okay. - I have to go talk to somebody down the hall. You know your way out? - Yeah? Who're you? - You were at the Century Grand the other night? - Yeah, so? - I'm looking for Holly. - Why's that? - I have something that belongs to her. - Holly's gone. So what do you got for her? - Where'd she go? - She has some apartment up on 34th Street. I don't know the address. You know, my guess is she's back out on the street, but I never know with her. What can I tell you, she's on horse, she's a heroin addict. - Why'd you hit her? - Cause she wouldn't listen to me. I told her to stop injecting that shit into her veins. So I come in the other night... - Drunk off your ass. - Yeah, and, but she was about to do it. So I stopped her. - By punching her in the face. - Yeah. I mean, what do you want me to say, I'm a total dick. There's nothing you're gonna say to me that's going to make me feel any worse than I already do. I got huge problems, and I really have trouble controlling myself, especially when I get drunk. Understand? - No. No man. I don't understand how a guy can beat the shit out of a woman like that. - Well, that's 'cause you're not me. And you don't fucking know me, so don't fucking judge me. So, what are you, hot for Holly or something? - No. - Lookit, I took her off the street. If she wants to go back on the needle, fine, fuck her. She wants to hit rock bottom again, that's her business. But if she comes back here and she starts fucking lying to me again, I'm gonna fucking kill her just to put her out of her own misery. - You took her money. - Fuck you. That was my money, bro. - I ain't your bro. - Lookit, I gave her money, and I said she could keep it if she stayed straight. - Well, I want to give it back to her. - What, so she'll just go buy drugs again? - Give me the money. - Fuck you. - I ain't playing, bub. - What'd you come up here to shake me down or something? I'll put you in jail, you fuck. - Hey. - What you need, man? - I'm looking for a tall girl, redhead, name's Holly? - You a cop? - No. - What are you, then? Her boyfriend? - No, man. - I get it. You trying to be a hero. You got a picture of Miss Holly? - I don't. - How was I supposed to help you find her? - I was hoping you'd know her by her name and description. - I don't. - Anywhere else you can buy around here? - Where she live? - I'm not sure, exactly. Maybe 34th Street. - Shit, you on 34th Street now. Unless you talking bout by the river. - I might be. - That's Tino Henoya's area, bro. - I'll look him up. - We done? What else you need, bro? - Give me two bags. - What you need? - I'm looking for this tall redhead, her name's Holly. You know the girl I'm talking about? - You a cop? Oh shit, long time, D. - Yeah. She left something at the hotel I work at. - And you tracking her down? - It's important that I find her. - You the one that beat her up? - No way, man, some shitbag boyfriend did that to her. He also stole her money, and I got it back. - You want to just give it to me and I'll pass it on? - Tino, I gotta find her. - You still work at the same place? - Century Grand, it's 46th Street... - Yeah, I know where it's at. I'll tell Holly you got her money, aight? - Just tell her I got something I want to give her, all right? - You want her to come to the hotel to get it? - I doubt she's gonna want to go back there. Look, how bout this, let me give you my home address. Just tell her to come here, all right? - So you at the same spot? - Yeah. - Yo, that chick Holly, you change her hair, her face, she looks just like... - Yeah. - Look, all I do is sell, man. People don't want to buy, I don't force shit. I promise you, I had nothing to do with what happened to Rachel. - Yeah, I know. - You still on that heavy stuff? - Off and on, you know, I don't shoot up anymore. - Where you buying from? - Here and there, man. Don't worry bout it. - I do worry about it. Some of that street shit is crazy, you heard? - Look man, could you just pass this on to her, all right? - I got you. Fuck, let's drive around the block or something, man. What you need? - Give me one bag. - Hey, baby girl. How you doing? - I'm okay. - Some guy came around here looking for you today. - Tell him to fuck off and die. Tell him to give me my money. - He did say he had something for you. - Who? Davis? Not a chance. - Nah, this guy's name was Dylan. He's the hotel manager at the Central Grand. - Did you fall asleep again? - Uh, yeah. Yeah. I'm the boss, I get to do what I want. - I know. I'm just wondering. - Night manager gets to make the rules, okay? As long as we get through the night and the hotel's here in the morning, I've done my job. - I heard that when Elan that the night shift manager, he spent half his time at the Kevin St. James bar. - Patrick used to talk to his girl all night. Okay, what's up? - We're all out of rooms, and this guy wants to check in. - Shit, we're at full capacity? - I told you that 20 minutes ago. - Yeah, I know, yeah, I remember that. You caught me in the middle of a sleep cycle or something. - All right, who's got rooms? - The Marriott Marquis. - I'm gonna be able to sell to all the top people. It's just a matter of convincing them on the upgrades. Hold on a minute, Jim. What the hell is taking so long? - Sir, unfortunately we don't have any rooms left. - What? Jim, did you hear that? Are you serious? - Yes. - Well, what the fuck am I supposed to do? - We have to walk you to another hotel. - Well this is fucking bullshit. This is, what the fuck does, what does that even mean? We've arranged a room for you at the Marriott Marquis. We'll pay for your cab fare there. You get the same room rate as you would here. Tomorrow night you're guaranteed a room here, and it's free. It's actually a really good deal. - Really? See, I don't see it that way. I'm here now, and my bags are here, and the company's paying for the fucking room, so what do I care? Motherfuckers. - That's what you get for checking in after 5 am, jackass. Did you hear Cesar's back on nights tomorrow? - Yep, Rico told me. - Guess we can expect to see more call girls and escorts. - I've never worked with Cesar on nights before. - He has a deal with every call girl in the city. Foreign businessman walks in and says he wants action, Cesar hooks him up with whatever he needs. And he gets a little bonus money from both the call girl and the guest. The bastard's making more money here than both of us put together. - Hear Scarlett Johansson's checking in tomorrow night? - Yeah, you mentioned it. So what's her name? It's like Greta Wanderking, something ridiculous. - Thought they changed the names to throw off the paparazzi as well? - Yeah, no, they change the names every five months or so. She has reservations at a bunch of hotels. - Hmm. Where's she staying? - She's staying here. Chris knows her manager. He said we'd give her the star treatment. How much time we got left? - 57 minutes. Watching every one. - I'm gonna go downstairs. I don't really feel like seeing Henry tonight. If he needs me, tell him to call me. You can hold down the fort for a little while, right? - Putting me in charge? Hell, all I've got to do is make sure the hotel is still here in the morning, right? - You listen. - Yeah. All right, wait. All right, cool. Um, yeah. No no no, that's fine, that's fine. Let's do that. I don't know, we'll work on it. All right look, I gotta go, okay? - Hey Phillip, what's up man? - Everything good? - Yeah Phil, you know, I'm just working. - Yeah, I heard you're at the Grand now man, that's great. Good for you. - I'm the overnight manager now. - What? Good for you. That's awesome. - I can't handle the hours, though. - Ah, don't whine to me about the hours. You think all I do is jerk off all day? I wish I had time to do that. All I do is work. - Well, you got a lot more energy than I do, Phil. You talked to Mom lately? - C'mon bruh, I thought we were just going to have a nice dinner. - Jeez, I'm just wondering, Phil. - Yeah. Yeah, I talk to her. - What's she been up to? - Same stuff. - Maybe I should call her, you know? - Yeah, I don't know about that. - Why not? - Don't give me that shit, you know why. - 'Cause my girlfriend hung herself in my apartment? - Jesus fucking Christ Dyl, what the hell is wrong with you? - I'm just asking if that's why she doesn't want to talk to me. - You really want to go there, huh? - Go there. - Maybe it's because she thinks you still got problems. - And not talking to me is the solution? - You wanna put the cards on the table, huh? Are you still on the stuff? - No, no man, you know, yeah, no. - That's great. If that's true, that's great. - I still got problems, though, Phil. You know, it's dealing with the pain. - Are you clean or not? - Every once in a while I still got problems and... - C'mon man, get your life together. I gotta take this all right, give me two minutes. - Yeah, man. - Hey. What the fuck do you have to give me? - Holly? - Tino said you had something for me? - Yeah I do, but it's inside and I'm late for work. - What do you have? - Look, can we just meet up tomorrow sometime? - Unless you're telling me that your fucking hotel found my money, I don't know what you have to give me that's worth a damn. - Look, do you have a place to stay? - What are you doing? You want me to stay at your place? Is that what you want? You want to bang me? - Look, let me at least give you some cab fare, all right? - Why are you helping me now? You should have helped me the other night. - Hey. - Hey. - What you got? - Negative five. - Stomachable. - Heard you walked a guy the other day. - Some business jerk off who couldn't give a shit that he was getting a free room, 'cause his company was paying for it. - So let's charge him. - Good idea. - Hey Marco, you watching the front desk? - No sir, I am off early tonight. Ciao, boss. - What's the deal, Cesar? - Hey Dyl, long time. We need to get this guy in that two bedroom suite and it ain't ready. - We'll have it cleaned ASAP. - Nope, it's occupied. - Sir, could you excuse us for a moment while we figure this out? - I hope this doesn't take too long, 'cause we been waiting for 30 minutes. - We'll have you in there ASAP. Excuse us. What happened? - Henry. He put somebody else in there this morning. - That prick fuck. I'm assuming all the other two bedroom suites are occupied? - Yup. - Shit. - Some guy offered me $500 if I'd show him my dick earlier tonight. - Did you do it? - Nah. - Why not? - I got morals, bro. - All the one bedroom suites are taken as well. - We gotta do a water leak. - Let's do it. - All right, call Jeff from security, get Pablo up there as well, and move her stuff to 1221, it's the king down the hall. - 1221, I'm on it. - Dylan. - You're late. - So what, it ain't busy. - That douchebag Henry gave away a two bedroom suite and now the guy who reserved it wants in. - Whaddya gonna do? - I got Cesar up there now with Pablo and Jeff. They're gonna move her stuff to a king down the hall. - What are you gonna do when the lady gets back? - We do a water leak. - What's that? - You'll see. Put your food order in. - Already did. How you feeling, Dyl? - Fine, why? - You just been off the past couple of days. - I'm tired. I just can't get used to these hours. - Okay. It's gonna be fun to have Cesar on tonight, huh? I can't wait to see what shit he's gonna pull. - Yeah, he better take it easy, okay? This whole place has been on edge ever since that thing went down with Holly. - Holly. That was her name? - Yeah. - Hmm. How did you know that? - She told us, don't you remember? - I can help you over here. - Could you call me a cab, please? - Yes. Hi, I need a cab to the Grand. Yes, thank you. - Hey. - Hey, hot stuff. How are things? - Same as always. You? - Eh. Slow tonight. - Yen? - I think so. - You got a family, Linda? - I do. Have a little girl, nine years old. Why do you think I'm doing this? - Where's her father at? - Well he's out working, making lots of money, and not giving a shit. - Sucks. - Yeah, I know. But, I am so glad that Cesar's back on nights because Rico don't do shit for my business. - Some guy asked Cesar to show him his dick tonight. - For free? - No, he said he'd give him $500. Cesar said no. - Really? Well maybe Cesar's got a little problem. - My pants would have been down on the word dollars. Show me your dick and I'll give you 500, bang, pay up. - Have a good night, Dyl. - You take care, Linda. - Ma'am? - Are you the fucker who authorized somebody to go into my room and touch my personal things? - Yes. - I'm going to fucking ruin you. You violated me. You violated my personal property. - Okay, no one violated anything, it was all supervised by two staff members and a security guard, okay? - My hands are fucking shaking here. They touched my clothes, they touched my toothbrush, they touched my underwear, my fucking underwear! - Okay ma'am, ma'am, you're gonna have to lower your voice. - Oh fuck you, you asshole. My company is gonna sue this fucking joint. - Look, how long are you staying here? - What are you going to give me a fucking free room? I don't give a shit, because nothing you can do can save you from the fact that you raped my stuff. - Did you really want all your stuff destroyed? - What? - You probably have 10 to 15 minutes before everything was gone. - What are you talking about? - Why do you think we moved your stuff? What do you think this is all about? - Because your operator said that you double-booked my room. - Well, she doesn't know what she's talking about. The computer doesn't even allow us to do that. We moved your stuff because a pipe burst and there was a water leak. So for what it's worth, we'd like to give you a complimentary room for tonight. - Well, I'd appreciate that. - Go up to your room and enjoy your nice dry bed. I'll have a complimentary bottle of wine sent up to you. - Thank you. - That was fucking brilliant. - God damn, man. I almost lost it, I swear to god I almost lost it. - Yeah, but you kept it together, man. Water leak? Shit. - Patrick created it. - Patrick's running the Royalty now, right? - Yeah, yeah. Best manager in the history of this hotel. - You know, people were saying that about you for a while there, Dyl. - They were saying it? What, before the night shift? - Before the night shift. God damn, that bitch got me all wound up. Standing there screaming in my face. I'm gonna fucking knock Henry's teeth out tomorrow. - Fuck him, okay? Don't let him get to you like this. - No, no, no. He's a piece of shit, okay? His stupidity, it causes this woman, he double books a room and now she's screaming in my face, okay? We moved her underwear. Like anybody wants to touch her fucking underwear. God dammit! Now I'm fucking wound up. My hands are shaking. - Jesus dude, you need to calm down. - Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm just all wound up right now, okay? I need to get outside, you want some coffee, dude? Can I get you coffee? I'm gonna get some. - I'm good, bro. I'm good, I'm good. Wow. - Dude, what the fuck happened? - I got jumped. - Fuck bro, how? - What time is it? It's 4:30. - I'm gonna go lay down in the back for a bit. How bad do I look? - I mean, you'll be all right. How big was the guy? - Big. - Unprovoked? - He yelled something and I yelled back. - You should've ignored him, man. - Hey dickhead, nice job in the double book. - Ah, what are you blaming me for, asshole? - Are you that much of an idiot? - I had no choice. Plus, she fell for your water leak bullshit, so who the fuck cares? - Chris is gonna have your ass. - Oh really? Who was she screaming at, me or you? - I fucking hate you, Henry. - Oh, well right back at you, druggie. - What did you just say? - Like we all don't fucking know. - What, I smoke a little pot, so what? - Oh, is that it, what else? Shoot fucking heroin much? - Show me the needle marks then, prick. I did it once in my life. - Don't you fucking bullshit me. You and your girlfriend got fucking high every day. That is why she hung herself. - Tell Chris if he wants to fire me, call me before 8 am so I know if I can sleep in or not. - Hey. - Hey. - I'm sorry about last night. I really don't know what I said. - I been there. Why don't you come inside, I'll give you that thing. C'mon. Sorry the place is such a mess. - I can't take this from you. - It's not from me. - Yes it is. - No, it's from Davis. - You got it from him? - Yeah. - Bullshit. If there's one thing I know about that cocksucker, it's that he never let anyone shake him down. - The money's yours. - Oh yeah, why? - How long you lived in the city, Holly? - Three years. - Where are you from originally? - Red Bank, New Jersey. - And how old are you? - 21, detective. - You got family? - Yeah. - They know what you're doing? Why don't you just go home? - What happened to your head? - I just got in a fight. I got jumped. - Tino said that, you and your girl... - Yeah, yeah. - She died? - Yeah, she died. - And you still, - I don't inject. You know, just every once in a while for the pain. - Right. So what do you want from me? - I just felt bad about what happened. - And you wanted to help me? - Is that wrong? - Maybe just a little hard to believe. - Well believe it. - So you went and saw Davis? - Yeah. Ended up smacking him upside the head. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. - He's gonna come looking for me eventually. - Yeah Holly, you need to stay away from that guy, okay? He said he may kill you next time. - All this help you're giving me, and you don't want anything in return? - What could you possibly give me? - No, no. - I'm clean, I've been tested. - It's not, no, it's not, I just can't do it, I'm not over her, and uh, no. - It's okay. - No, you just look like her and, - Dylan, it's okay. - I'm sorry. I mean, it was a really great kiss. Why don't you go home, Holly? I'm not talking about where you live here, I'm talking about your family. Why don't, wait, wait, wait, why don't you stop by the hotel tomorrow night? - I'm not going back there. - Yeah, I realized how stupid that sounded right after I said it. Shit, I don't even know if I have a job there anymore. - What? - Got in a fight with a dickhead coworker. Look, why don't you stay here? - I've got my own place. - Yeah but, you know, that prick Davis. Wait, here, look. Could you write down your phone number? Just so I can call you and check up on you? - Gonna be keeping tabs on me? - I just, yeah, yeah actually. I just wanna check up on you every once in a while. Make sure you're okay. If I call this number, you'll answer? - Yeah, I'll answer. Bye, Dylan. - Good, you start tomorrow. Okay, see you then. - That my replacement? - No. I fired Henry. He shouldn't have said what he said. Well good, 'cause I was going to knock him out every morning until you got rid of one of us. - Sit down. What are you doing? - Huh? - You're not just adjusting to the night shift. What are you on? - You know, I just been drinking a lot. - That's all? - Yeah, that's all. - I heard you used the water leak. - Worked like a charm. - I tried it once. Guy didn't believe me. Had to comp his room for three nights. - Patrick created it. - Forget Patrick, dude. You're better than he was. Sure he was a charmer, but some people, he came off like a used car salesman. People believe you, Dylan. No one, and I mean no one, could have handled that domestic abuse incident like you did. It just sucks though because I have to fire you because you're lying about what you're on. - You don't have to fire me. - Tell me what you're on. - This one time a few years back, Rachel and I were visiting our friend Eliza in Los Angeles, she lived in the Hills. And there was this big 4th of July party. Somebody brought fireworks. And Rachel lit them off. She was always doing crazy shit like that. And these two neighbors came by, these guys who thought they were all tough and they told us that we had violated the city codes, what the hell do we know about the city codes in Los Angeles we're from New York City, you know? We told Eliza we'd stop, and we meant it. But these guys wouldn't let it go. They demanded to know who did it. They wouldn't leave til them found out who did it. And I ended up getting in a fight with one of the guys, and the cops came, and the party was ruined. - What's the point? - The point is, if these guys had just taken our word for it and believed us, everything would've been fine. The party could've gone on. I like you, Chris. You worked your way up from bellman to front office manager. And I respect you. But if I gotta tell you what I was on, I'm just gonna quit. God, it's Thursday, I can just start my weekend early. But if you can just believe me when I tell you I'm not going to do it again, and I mean it, well then the party can continue. Welcome to the Century Grand. - You're Dylan, right? - Yes. - I'm Dave, this is my wife Gloria. We were here two years ago on our honeymoon. You're the same guy that checked us in. - That's great. - We had the most fantastic time staying at the Grand. - Well hopefully you'll have an even better time this time. - How've you been? - Good, I'm the night manager now. - That's fantastic. - I think we have a king room booked, hell, I don't know. Maybe I can give you 100 reasons why you might want to move us to a suite? - Those are great reasons. - Oh man, I remember these golden keys! - Enjoy your stay, folks. Enjoy your honeymoon anniversary. I'll have a complimentary bottle of wine sent up to your room. - He give you a tip? - $100. Smartest tip in the world, hotel manager. - Those two bedroom suites are $550 a night. - Thank god no more Henry to piss on my parade. - The old Dyl, nice to see you back, man. - Where's Linda? - Huh? - Linda. I haven't seen her. - Me neither. - Hey guys. - Cesar, come here. - Yeah, what's up boss? - Have you seen Linda? - You didn't hear? - Didn't hear what? - She got killed. - Shit. How? - Her ex-husband found out that she was turning tricks in order to feed her kid. She came home from working, he was there waiting with a shotgun. It was in the Times. - Wow, that sucks. - Those exes, they'll get you every time. Sir, let me get these bags for you? - Hey, Tino. - Yo, you met up with Holly? - I did. - Got that settled? - Yeah, man listen, do you know her address? - Why? - I need to find her man, what's it to you? - I ain't heard from her in like a week. - Do you have her address? You owe me this. - 353 west 34th Street. I don't remember her apartment, though. - Yeah, what is it? - I'm looking for Holly? - No, I don't know any Holly. - I'm sorry. - Oh, you ain't following me in here. - Why not? - Who you here to see? - Holly. - Holly who? - Holly Stevens. - She ain't answering, she ain't here. - No no, please man, I'm her friend, trust me. - Kind of friend that beats the shit out of her? - That wasn't me, I swear to god, that wasn't me. No no man please, c'mon. I think something bad might've happened to her. - What do you mean something bad? - Get the fuck out of my way. - I'm calling the police! - Dylan! What are you doing here? - Christ, Holly. - Holly, you okay? - I'm fine. He's a friend. - You sure? - Yes. - I thought you were dead, Rachel. - Wait, Dylan. - It's okay. - Why did you leave me? - What do you mean? - I asked you to stay. But you didn't. - Dyl, I don't know what happened man, but I covered for you. He came in with this new guy Tim this morning, and I told him you had to run out for an emergency. So you're cool. See you Sunday night. I'll take a walk round the block To ease it up Clear my head and tire myself out I'll test myself constantly Just to see where I end up so afraid Of messing up Don't you believe That it's better to be free Of the things that make you ill All those pills, they make you ill It's kind of ironic, Given that is your name You will But at the same time, they eat away at you The doctor gave me the wrong damn thing I've looked it up Seems I know myself better than you know anyone Don't you believe That it's better to be free Of the things that make you ill All those pills, they make you ill - I'm headed back to New Jersey. - That's good, I'm happy for you. Thanks for that night. - You were worried about me. - Yeah, I was. - You called me Rachel. - I'm sorry, I didn't even realize. - It's not your fault what happened to your girl. We make our own choices in this world. - I know. If you ever need anything I'll rent a car, I'll come to New Jersey. - Why would I need you? - Would you just let me be a guy for a minute? What're you gonna do in Jersey? - I dunno. - Look, I know you have to go, and I think it's great. But I don't... - What? - I don't want you to go without knowing... Butterflies, tinted eyes falling down to the sea At high tide, bringing me Back to the place I can feel Love She bring me back home Coffee cup, belly up to the bar We walk in pairs Scattered by numbers Dare us to stare at the signs Written everywhere The end of time is here Beware If you believe There's a heaven Somewhere between You and me You and me Well I will try To believe there's a heaven But the angel gone blind In the sweet summer snow I hardly remember What I used to know What I used to know What I used to Know Rattling across open place Truth look on with disdain At the fear No one will claim at the end of the day Desire remains And if you believe There's a heaven
