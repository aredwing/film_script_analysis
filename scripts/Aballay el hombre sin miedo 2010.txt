"Negro"! Come help the man. Please, don't... It's OK. Thanks. Pig! Good morning Morales! Morales! Nice animals, Morales... I'll take the four of them. But after paying your taxes and giving you some animals for free, I need some cash. I see, this is your job. And how much for these animals? They're strong, healthy, well-fed. At least ten each. - What the hell do you feed them? - Boss! What is it? Torres's been killed. And who killed him? - I don't know. - You don't know? Have you seen them? - What, are you blind? - I was drunk So you were drunk! You fucking asshole! You were drunk? Give the animals to him. What about what we discussed? Heads, you're dead. Tails, you live. Hope your lucky streak goes on. Take him to Lopez's, you asshole! Mind the steps. You'll be comfortable here. This is La Malaria? No, it's near here. Across the river. Why do they call you by a man's name? Careful. What's your name? My name is Juana. And yours? Julian, and yours? Juana... And yours? Oh, Saint who performs miracles I know I shouldn't bother you. You look after the Dead and the Living. But Pauper, please, I have no one else to turn to. I'm calling out for you, asking you to work a miracle and help him stay alive and safe from harm. Atrue miracle, like the captives faith. Hi. Come in, boy. Come in. What are you looking for? Bale wire. I have something special. This... It's just arrived... Look at this. Look. This fabric. Look. This fabric is great. The curtains you could make with it! This is Jacquard. Look. - I'll give you a discount. - No. Wire. Bale wire. Wire? Bale wire? I have the best one here, but it's sold. But I'll get more. Tell me where you live and I'll have it delivered. At Don Benavides'. Don Benavides? Sure. You like scarves? Take a look at this one. It's cotton from India. Take it, it'll make a good present for a young lady. - It's on the house. - Thank you. OK. But you know what, dear? You can't wear those pants any longer. No, look at them... Thank you. You like it? Yes He's The Pauper, a local Saint. Nobody knows where he lives, but he keeps appearing. Those who have seen him say he's always on horse. He lives up there. From there he's cured kids, they say. He helps people. He's very good. He performs miracles. Who carved it? My godfather, from Cordoba. He's a good person. He lives near the river. He used to live with Clarisa, a friend of mine. But she kicked him out because... he drinks a lot. And she got tired. He's a devotee of the Saint, so he makes lots of these... Bigger ones, with a long beard, short beard, another hat... He has an altar and prays. I'm also a devotee. Kiss him, he'll bring you good luck. - You're wrong, Boss. - Why? Why are you so happy? It's an albino pig. It's still a baby. It's 20 days old, but... It'll be white forever. Does it have a name? - Ramon. Do you like it? - Yes. Sounds nice. Ramon. When I call it, it'll come. - Juana... - Yes? Let me make a portrait of you. - A portrait? - Yes What's a portrait? Adrawing. Oh, a drawing. Why? To remember you. Are you leaving? No. Because I like drawing. Just because you like it... - With Ramon? - Of course. OK. Excuse me. He'll make a portrait of us, Ramon. Smile. Pig, go get Benavides. Good morning. Good morning. Here's a present for you to wear tonight. Nice day, isn't it? Yes. Nice... Hello. Commander Frutos, La Malaria's Judge of the Peace. And who are you? I asked what your name was! Julian Erralde. Mr. Erralde is working for us And how long are you staying? Not long. That's OK. People from big cities are not good at field chores. Come here, Pig! Here's a son of yours! Ramon... Easy... You can prepare it for the feast tonight. And you, Juana, get ready. I'll send for you tonight. Sure. Here's the money. What business do you have with these people? Come, Pig! We have to prepare the party for tonight! I see you in the light of dusk walking with your girl, and I'm behind. I don't know where you're from or what your name is, I bark at you for a while, but you don't even look at me. I dream that you come and get me, we get stuck together, then we go to sleep. In the light of dusk I watch you go by I return home alone, then I start to bark. Music man, stop the music! You all know our sacred values: God, our Nation and our families. So I've gathered you here today to leave my path of sins and tell you that I'm getting married. Cheers! Cheers, Commander! Long live Commander Frutos. Stop it! Here's my future bride, so happy she's almost crying. Let's hear it for her, poor thing! Bring her to me, Vargas! Come here, girl! We'll continue with the ceremony. The religious one will take place some other day. You don't like the ceremony, baby? What a pity, darling! Grab her! Now we'll have this one. This is the real ceremony. Dead One! Let her go! Oh, we have a guest. What's wrong with you? You fallen in love with her? I'll show you who's mounting this mare! Afucking gaucho roulette! Musicians... We need some music! Where is he? Where is he? Where are you? I'll find you... Where is he? Maybe here, maybe there... I don't know, but I'll find you. I'll find you. Where are you? Where's the big city guy! Where are you? Where are you?! Let's see... Go, go! The Dead One's responsible, Godfather. Do you think he'll be OK? He's hurt. If you don't take care of him, he'll be blind. Fuck! Shit! I'm sorry I got you involved in this, Godfather. Dear, you know I curse just because. But if in a case like this you don't ask me for help, I won't talk to you again. You understand, "Negro"? We must run away from here. I'll go get Pastrana. Take this. Just in case. Tell The Pauper to be careful. That's a package stolen from the Dead One. I'm blind. I can't see. Of course, you really hurt your eyes. Don't touch the bandage. Be patient. You'll be able to see again. Who are you? Antonio like your uncle, the one that's wicked? No. Mariano. No, the female version is better. I like "Mariana". How about Silvan? Or Jos? Jos, like Virgin Mary's husband. Aballay! What's wrong with you, Aballay? Are those bags too heavy for you? Why don't you give them to me? Come here, girl. You're pretty. Get down here! You want to pray? Pray, you asshole! Aballay, what shall we do with them? Do you believe in God? Tell him the Dead One sends his regards. Come here! Kill him, Dead One! You son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Take this! Take this! After me, somebody more powerful will come. I'm not worthy to untie His sandals. When He comes, deserts will open up and lilies will bloom. Meanwhile, let's celebrate the Virgin with the words of the prophet. Praise the Lord! It is possible to wash away your sins... ...and the pain caused by them. But nothing is possible without a sacrifice. Simeon the Elder, the first stylite, redeemed his sins and withdrew from the Earth where he had sinned by staying on pillars in the desert and never coming down, so that he could be closer to God. He would endure freezing weather and the boiling sun, night and day. After spending decades on a pillar, the Lord, who knew about his sacrifices, said: "This is a fearless man, deaf to the debauchery of the winds, whose body feeds from Heaven's bread and Heaven's wine. " Rejoice, since he who approaches God and is remorseful will receive God's mercy and be forgiven, like those brave stylites. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen. Amen. I was born in your valleys, I'm made of stone and sand. I was born in the woods, I was raised in stony ground. And calandra larks and thrushes used to sing to me. I was born in your valleys, I'm made of stone and sand. And calandra larks and thrushes used to sing to me. And calandra larks and thrushes used to sing to me. I'll see those birds again. Father, I'd like to know about the saints you talked about. I said that they lived in sanctity. They were anachorets, or hermits. Didn't you say something else? Something else? Stylites, maybe? It's the same. Stylites were a special type of anachorets. Anachorets were solitary people. They would willingly withdraw from other people. They would inhabit caves or live on a mountain top. What for? To serve God in their own way. You said they were on top of... On top of pillars or columns. Those were stylites. And there they stayed... through cold or hot weather, whether they were sick or hungry... How long? For eternity! Simeon the Elder spent almost 37 years like that. Simeon the Younger, 70 years. So, what do you think now of their sacrifice? Could you imagine such a thing? And how did they eat? Uncomfortably. Bugs, mice... Sometimes sad people or believers would go on a pilgrimage to ask them to ask God to help them. You said they used to... Show repentance and meditate. Why did they show repentance? To relieve the pain caused by their sins. Stylites would stay on pillars to get closer to Heaven and to withdraw from the Earth, since that was where they had sinned. Will you bear with me, brother? Will you bear with me? It's forever. Are you always on a horse? Always. Do you sleep on it as well? I do. So you're The Pauper. People pray to you. That's just a belief. I'm just riding my horse. And why don't you get off it? What's the matter, my friend? There are still people I have to kill. And that's terrible. What comes afterwards... ...is even worse. My wife has returned. Thank you so much, friend! Where's the city guy? The Earth has eaten him... Didn't even spit his heart! Did you miss your daddy? Won't you give him a kiss? Come on, kiss your daddy! Kiss your daddy, kiss your daddy! Come on, kiss him! Where's that handsome boy? You've stolen him from me, so you'll give him back to me. Understand? There he is! Get him! Don't let him escape! Get him! Oh, Saint who performs miracles. I know I shouldnt bother you. You look after the Dead and the Living. But Pauper, please, I have no one else to turn to. I'm calling out for you, asking you to work a miracle and help him stay alive. Afinal miracle that finds him safe from harm. Pretty boy! Don't you want some meat? City guy! Don't worry if you have loose teeth, the meat's already been chewed! Dead One! I brought you a present. Is that Aballay? Let Juana go, and the Saint is yours. Aballay is the Saint? What a surprise! Vargas! Drop your gun! And the man! I'm getting nervous. You stinking city boy! What is it, Julin? I'm leaving. You're leaving? - I thought... - I have to go. I know. It's because of the Dead One. It's because I've been with him, that son of a bitch... I'm dirty... - It's that. - No, you're not. It's me. I'm poisoned. I've spent my whole life thinking of avenging my father's death. But you've killed all of them. Not all of them. The worst one is alive. Who? The Pauper. The Pauper? What are you saying, Julian? The Pauper saved your life. He is a saint, Julian. You can't kill a saint. You can't, Julian! Don't do it. Stay with me. Get down! No. You know I can't get down. I had to do it.
