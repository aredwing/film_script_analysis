He took a bullet in his head and went down fighting for India. The Rajputs won another Maha Vir Chakra (gallantry medal). Major Baljit Singh Randhawa gave up his Iife.. ..on 1 7th May in the act of driving the Pakistanis from Black Rock. Captain Ranveer Singh and.. ..Sepoy Buddh Singh were awarded the Vir Chakra (gallantry medal).. ..for losing their Iives in winning an outpost.. ..which the Indian Government promptly returned.. ..to Pakistan in an act of goodwill. In Kashmir, to this day, every man.. ..in the Rajputana Rifles puts duty before self. Hawaldar Ranveer Singh didn't budge an inch from his post.. ..despite an entire section of men being wiped out. Even today, nothing means more to them.. ..than the honour of their regiment.. The fifth generation of Rajput soldiers.. ..keep the flame alight to this day.. ..asking their Rajput brothers "Who will you die for?" He says, "For my battalion". And who does the battalion belong to? The Rajputana.. And who does Rajputana belong to? India.. And what does India do for you? Ever since the dawn of democracy, Rajputs.. ..have been repeatedly betrayed. Sadar Vallabh Bhai Patel had appealed to us.. Come here. - "One India.." Give up your states and become one.. ..nation. - Wear this. - He urged us, we gave them up. He asked us for our wealth.. We emptied our treasuries.. For one India.. But where, may I ask, is that one India? Our democracy has reached a stage.. ..where no one wants to vote anymore. Everyone's nation is the four walls of their homes. No government can accumulate a majority vote.. We had a heritage a thousand years old.. ..and at the time they snatched it from us.. ..it was better than what they have now. In the name of democracy, all they do is take power away from us. And do those very things they have always accused us of.. The Patiala report only mentioned the mistakes and.. ..indiscretions we committed. Nothing else. There isn't a single act they have committed that can be called clean. To this day people call us royalty. Royalty! They respect us. Why? Because they know we have sacrificed for our people. The King of Jodhpur once cocked his gun.. ..at Vallabh Bhai Patel's secretary and said.. "Don't betray the people of Jodhpur." But they betrayed everybody. In the 1967 Parliament elections.. ..when our crown prince stood as a candidate.. ..then what happened? The Congress was wiped out in Rajasthan.. The people voted 24 princes into power across the nation.. What did the government do then? They called an All India Congress Committee Conference. Clamped down on all royal centres.. ..and took away all our privileges. They bought us to our knees. We had to accept defeat. We lost because even after a thousand years.. ..we were still wrangIing amongst ourselves. Enough! If we have to rebuild our Rajputana, we will have to unite. If we seek to save our Rajputana from them, we will have to unite.. A patriot must always be ready to defend.. ..his country against its government. It's time to wage a war! For our independence, for our land. And for that, we need resources and army. And most importantly, you will have to shed your blood. If you are not ready to shed blood, stop dreaming! You will gain nothing. We will not be able to regain our land.. ..respect, the glory we once had.. So, if you are ready to become one.. If you are ready to shed your blood.. Let's say it together.. Hail the land of the brave! Hail the land of the brave! - Hail the land of the brave. Hail Rajputana! - Hail Rajputana! Hail Rajputana! - Hail Rajputana! Hail the land of the brave! - Hail the land of the brave. My grandfather, Noor Mohammed.. ..worked for the king here.. He fell in love with the princess.. ..the idiot had him buried alive in these salt pans. Even had his bones melted. We need to go right.. ..there. That used to be a British booze joint. The British called it a 'Bar'. They fled but they left behind their 'Bar'. Come. Where the hell are you? The customers have come. Listen. The train drops you at your doorstep.. This is our local flute player. He Iives here. Why? No one knows. You can Iive here too. I've just seen him play these.. ..never sells anything. What is his work, why, when, how, who.. every question, one reply. Just Iike that. This is 69. 70 minus 1 . Don't go right, because there's no right. Does anyone stay here? - Yes, a student of Desharaj college.. Great chap! A Rajput? The real thing.. What's his name? Rananjay Singh. - Do you drink? Yes. - Smoke? Yes, and I wander around aimlessly. I get intimate with every woman I see. If any idiot get tough with me, I give it to him. I have a gun. The pellets are quite dangerous. He is not a good fellow, stay away from him. I've spoken to the warden. Just keep checking the hostel Iist. I've paid six month's rent. The rest of the money is with Bhanwar. Take only as much as you need. Okay? And buy a bicycle.. "Chanting Lord Hanuman's name.." "..helps one overcome all obstacles." "Hail Lord Hanuman." "Bestow me with your grace." You look old. What's your age? How many times have you failed? Not once. I'm a post graduate. So, Uncle, have you come to teach here.. I've come to study law. Law.. All those who can't do anything else come here to study law. Want some? No! Want this? Stop soiling your pants. You! Are you his brother's rat? So, why do you look so worried? You know what I'll do if you call him? What? Light this, I'll tell you. You see that fan here.. Yes. How many blades does it have? Three. If I hang you there instead how many would there be? Two arms, two legs.. how many? Four. And what about your head, you fool? Go sleep. You come with me. Where? Laaka.. A bite. The taste of forbidden fruit seems delicious on my tongue. My heart goes berserk.. The taste of forbidden fruit seems delicious my tongue. My heart goes berserk.. One bite, I tremble and shiver, as if I were stung. My heart goes berserk.. One bite, I tremble and shiver, as if I were stung. My heart goes berserk.. The taste of forbidden fruit seems delicious on my tongue. My heart goes berserk.. Bana, Ransa is here. I fear being shamed in this world.. "I fear being shamed in this world.." I fear the society in this world. Will someone blow cold on this body in heat? Will someone throw some water on the fire in my heart? He left me in sweet pain, left me begging for more.. My heart goes berserk.. The taste of forbidden fruit seems delicious on my tongue.. My heart goes berserk.. Blame it on the delight for that hard and juicy bite.. It seems Iike a trifle but it's full of danger.. Can't blame you for your plight.. In all of Rajasthan there isn't one as bold as you.. There's trouble in these steamy folds.. There's trouble in these steamy folds.. You can warm your hands on the heat of my desire.. "You can warm your hands." I sigh Iike the sound of an uncorked bottle.. I sigh Iike the sound of an uncorked bottle.. My heart beats Iike a wild horse galloping.. My Iimbs are weighed down by the desires of a hundred hearts.. My heart goes berserk.. The taste of forbidden fruit is delicious my tongue.. My heart goes berserk.. One bite, I tremble and shiver, as if I were stung.. My heart goes berserk.. Move off! Stop the music. Game over, get lost. Game over, get lost. Everyone! Hey! Where are you going? Wait. Weren't you in Laaka with Ransa last night? Yes. - You a Rajput? Yes. - From Rajasthan? Yes. Dad's from Bikaner. Where are you headed? To find out about the hostel. Need a room? Need a room? - Yes. But my elder brother has already spoken with the warden.. Oh, okay. If you need a room, let me know. Anything else, let me know. No need to be scared. If anyone troubles you inside, just let me know. All right? My name is Bhati, Rajendra Bhati.. Hail Lord Ram. I want to meet the warden. - 237. Yes? - My name is Dileep Singh. I am here to meet the warden for the hostel. Are you new here? - Yes. Do you study or teach? I'm studying. Law? Come in. I want to meet the warden. Come in.. Come in. Is your old man going to shut it for you? Shut the door. Come here. You had come to Laaka last night, right? What's the power of your glasses? Pardon. - Are you deaf too, idiot? You fool, what's the power in your glasses? - Minus two. Say it in Hindi. Minus 'do.' - Say the 'minus' in Hindi too.. 'Ghate (minus) do.' So, what is left if you lose your privates? What's your name? Dileep. Dileep what? Film-star Dileep Kumar? Dileep Kumar Singh. Your father's name? Raghvinder Singh. Where are you from? - Bikaner. How many buffaloes do you have at home? - Seven. Not in the stable, at home. Who stretched you this long, Iike a pole? I know why. Someone pulled his leg too hard. Please, I've just come to meet the warden. Where do you think you're going? Get hold of him. Make him Iie down. Make him Iie down. - What are you doing? Take his pants off. Take him down. Get off me. Please let me go. - Remove all his clothes. Do we look gay to you? Get his wallet. There's just a hundred and fifty here. You.. - Anwar, Iisten. Please don't do this.. - Listen. Hey, Murari. Listen. Put him there, with that lousy woman. Naked? - What else? Pick him up? - Take him away. Listen. Open the door. Please. Please.. Don't look here. Please. Lodge a complaint with the police. Keep looking and keep me informed. Wait another day. No. No.. His brother already had a heart attack when he heard. I left the chick midway to come here. Haven't even sIipped my protection off. Open the door. Let me go, please. Too much drama. - Anybody there? Lets take care of him. Please.. Shout. Yell, you idiot. Let go of my hand. I'll thrash you. - Please, let me go. Shut up.. If you yell again, I've just stripped you.. I'll sell you to these gays. The Iights remain on or I'll mess up the daylights out of you. Come on. Imran, Iisten.. Who could have done this? We don't know. - What is your name? Whose? - Yours? Bhanwar. I got a call that a boy was found lying. Then I passed the information to them - Bittu! Can you identify the person who did this? That girl.. Anu, your hair? Anu, you're smoking a cigarette? What if the warden comes to know? So? Hello? How are you my child? All okay? I had called three days back.. We were at the initiation of the new teachers. Oh, okay. How's Rajpur? Anu, what happened? - It's very cold here. Anu, my child, what's wrong? Papa.. - Speak up. Should I come there? Speak up. I'll call you in a bit, Papa. What are you laughing at? I'll smash your teeth with this phone if you laugh at me again. Yours too! This was nothing really. When I was in university, the ragging was far worse. They used to hang us up side down in the commode and flush it. They called it 'brain wash.' Anyway, forget about it now. It's all right. Is your brother an idiot by birth or did he study to become one? Forget it? How can you let it pass just Iike that! Jadwal.. Jadwal? Jadwal. That rogue.. What are you looking for? What are you looking for? You'll hit him with a hockey stick? It's for you. My hand's more than enough. Let's go. I don't want to go. Why? Are you planning a peace march? I don't want to hit anyone. 'I don't want to hit anyone.' Of course, you want to walk around the campus naked. Shake the hands that strip you.. ..thank them with all your heart. Your brother is an idiot Iike you. You're coming with me. Come on, pick it up! I don't know how to hit someone. Why are you hitting me? If you don't know how to hit, learn to get hit. I'll hit you. Come on, you coward, hit back! Don't hit him. Get off him. You stay put. Come on, go peel the potatoes. Go peel the potatoes. Pen the door. I'll deal with you. Open the door. Open it. Open it. That was solid! Come on, pick up that hockey stick.. ..and strap your glasses on tight. Murari runs towards their room. Open the door. Jadwal! Jadwal! Either breathe or talk, don't try both. What's wrong? Ransa is here. So? He has a hockey stick. What else does he have? A motorcycle. A motorcycle? And what else? A house, a car, money and what else? I have a mama. Jadwal. You won't get away with this Jadwal. Gag him. Shove him inside! Next.. Take this and Iisten, I don't want to see you here again. Get the air filled somewhere else. The desire for sacrifice is in our hearts.. ..let's see what strength there is in the arms of our executioners.. When the time is right, we'll tell the heavens.. How can we tell you now what is in our hearts? Let's see what strength there is in the arms of our executioners.. Wash up now.. Why? Are you taking us to a temple? He's Iike a God for you now. How can we tell you now what is in our hearts? Is the water clean? We've dug a well of mineral water for you.. Oh, if you were to come this day to India.. You'd see a land in the throes of thrills. The youth here care not for any larger cause. He hoists his flag only for his woman. In every march will be a dumb man who sings.. And deaf men who march to the sound of silent drills. The age of Indian hand spun cloth is gone.. Even our underwear is now spun in foreign mills. Let's see what strength there is the arms of our executioners. When the time is right, we'll tell the heavens.. The desire for sacrifice is in our hearts. The desire for sacrifice is in our hearts. This is Prithivi Singh, Duki Bana's brother. Sit. Hello. That's enough. Is this you? No, no. He is His Highness Imagine Singh.. But he was a foolish man. He spoke of love. Imagine, we are all Iiving as one. No countries, boundaries, nothing. He used to wear round glasses.. He spoke of non-violence. All those who wear round glasses are similar. They all wore round glasses.. ..that's why their understanding of things was also circular.. Your glasses are round too. That's why no one Iistens to me too. Get inside and rehearse, no need to start a shindig out here.. Hey, Duki, can you take a look at this? Go inside. Come on. You were the one that started a fight at Laaka. Yes. This is the boy we heard of, the one who was found naked in a room. You're a Rajput? Yes. A fine Rajput you are, you should have taught him a lesson. We did go to teach him a lesson, got messed up again instead. He had a gun. Scared of guns? He doesn't have the courage to fire a gun.. ..he just struts around holding it. Grab him outside MangIi after dinner.. ..and lay his brains out on a plate. Why the hell are you here? To meet my daughter. She is not your daughter. Karan! Take this money and get out. We don't need your charity. Come to this house when you have the guts to.. ..say 'She is my daughter.' Brother! Go inside. Go inside! Please leave. One moment. "I am a big girl, in a big world." "It's not big thing if you believe me.." "What I do.." "Miss you much.." This man should never be seen here again. Never! Give me a cigarette. One. What's up!? How is Duki Bana? Is he holding on well? Light. Care for a drag? Would you Iike to smoke? Come on, have it. Let's go. Are you sure? Okay, see you. They are coming.. Raise an alarm. Jadwal. Jadwal.. You catch a bus and reach Polo Victory. I'll see you there. Run. Slow down. That idiot must be hiding here somewhere. There's his bike. He's around somewhere. Stop.. stop! Go get the rest of the guys. Need to stay here all night. Those rogues are looking for us everywhere. Told you not to get into this. Shut up. Watch. The heroine is going to strip. I love you. I really mean it. - You always stay at a distance from me. How did you get close to me? - You own the mills now. I'll always be with you. - How? Are you coming out or should we drag you? Duki Bana is calling you. Come on. Wait here. You wait here. I'll just talk to Bana. Bana. What the hell is happening? Bana, he broke Jadwal's head.. Why? Bana.. What? Jadwal had them.. Hung them upside down in the bathroom. Yes. Brainwashed them. Yes, sir. End all this. if I get into this, I'll thrash Jadwal and hang him right there. Did you get it? Like Najibullah was hung in Kabul. You weren't even born then. Yes, sir. What? Do you even remember where you came from? Leave all this. Okay. - Come on. Bhati, get them to my place. I want you to stand in the election for the post of General Secretary. Me? No, no. Elections aren't my cup of tea. You'll represent the Rajputana party. How will that help? We'll form a union.. And then? And then we can do as we feel Iike. What do we feel Iike doing? You ask too many questions, just do as I say. You don't drink. And don't trust us.. Bittu. Bittu, someone's here. Let me sleep. Someone's come right into the house. So, go tell Ransa. Who are you? How did you come here? I stay here. This is the King's property. I pay the rent. Me and Ransa. Ransa.. Rananjay? You're His Highness' son? His Highness of nonsense.. The world has gone places.. There's no democracy left to speak of here.. ..and he's seeing visions of aristocracy. There's no difference between him and Duki Bana. Not an ounce. He's turned his palace into a resort. Serves tea to fair women and expects me to do the same. Listen. So, you came to see my face.. If you're done, can I leave? I'm fed up of sitting here. I might die any day now. So, you want me to stop Iiving? Ransa! You shut up. This property, what will become of it.. Give it to the government, they'll turn it into a museum. I'm notjoking. I'm here in Rajpur only because of you. The day all this becomes mine, I'll sell it and move on. I don't want to Iive in a history book. Don't worry about me. When you die, I'll be there to Iight your pyre. I'm going. Let's go Dileep. Let's go. Come on. Why don't you kiss his feet too? You aren't allowed to smoke here.. ..but you smoke. Nobody will object. After what happened to you.. It happened to me. Why are you worried? I can understand. Anuja. What does Duki Bana want to do with this party of his? No idea. If he wants to contest the election.. ..why doesn't he do it on a larger scale? What will he get by winning the college elections? Youth! Youth changes society. But what fancy change does he want to bring about? What problems are we facing that other nations aren't facing too? Look, if you want to stand for the elections, do it. If you don't, don't. But don't ask any questions. Why do questions make you weak? Because you have no answer, that's why. Don't worry, my friend. I'll fight those elections.. ..not for myself, not for any of you.. ..but for the welfare of our society. Got it? I'll bless this college with electricity and water. I'll work exactly how all our politicians work. With perfect honesty.. ..and I promise to never ever stare at my neighbour's wife. Oh, wow! Hi, Dileep. Sanjeev. Jadwal did some good after all. For a second, I didn't recognise you.. You shouldn't have come here. Why? What if the hostel boys see you? What's left of me to see? You stay here? What is this? A bad habit. Opium, weed, grass, a bad habit.. ..can you pass me the ashtray? Some music? It's begun, it's a flood a thousand heads smell blood. It's time for the battle cry. For the glory and the pride, give Iimb or Iife or step aside. It's time to let arrows fly. He that would die if needed, and kill unheeded.. ..is the most powerful.. It's begun, it's a flood a thousand heads smell blood. It's time for the battle cry.. "For the glory and the pride give Iimb or Iife or step aside. It's time to let arrows fly." "Well begun is half the battle won." "The one who kills or gets killed.." "..is the most powerful." "The one who kills or gets killed.." "..is the most powerful." In the word of the Lord, in the holy scripture of God.. War separates the strong from the weak. Whether it's the Kaurava masses, or the five Pandavas.. He who can fight is truly great. There's a good chance this girl will win. She's student of law. The results of the law exams aren't out yet, right? No. So, what are you thinking? Cut her off. It won't end in just a win.. ..there's no restraint without within.. It matters not if this battle ends in death. If death is not the real end, to fear death we don't pretend. And this, we roar at the sky. Kiran's answer-sheet has disappeared. Without a minimum score of 60%.. ..she won't be eligible to stand for the election. "Its begun, it's a flood a thousand heads smell blood. It's time for the battle cry." "For the glory and the pride, give Iimb or Iife or step aside." "It's time to let arrows fly." "Well begun is half the battle won." Hello.. Dad? Yes, I am fighting the elections. Why don't you tell Ransa to withdraw? Why always us? Hello, tell me, talk to me. Will you declare us as your legitimate heirs? What did he say? Your father had no answer. Your answer-sheet has vanished. Vanished? Brought a new one. Fill it up. You broke your guitar string, right? Replace it.. Where's Duki Bana? Why? Give the answer. Sit here. Let go. What's the problem, tell me, but stop shouting first. Who does he think he is? How dare he take money from His Highness in my name? The thing is, the thing is.. ..whatever expectations this country had from anyone.. I've already heard that one. Whatever expectations this country had from anyone.. I told you I've heard it fifty times already. You've heard it but haven't understood it. So, understand it. Whatever expectations this country had from anyone.. He flushed those expectations down the toilet. Please go inside. I am going. I am going. I have never taken five cents my father.. How dare you'll.. We don't know who your father is. You know everything. He was the great pretender. Thought he was the king of the city. Shut up. - You act too smart! - Move off. Hello. - Hello. Come on in. Is Bana inside? Hey. Very smart. Bana. What do you think of yourself? Who the hell do you think you are? You went to His Highness. Where is the money? With me. Why? How dare you take it? You knew who I was? I didn't know a thing. This is crazy. We didn't take your money. His Highness came to meet me. He heard you were contesting the elections. He's a true blooded Rajput. He said, "See to it that my son does not lose." I said, "okay." He dumped the money in my hand and left. I want all the money back. Bhati. Think it over. Why the hell are you touching it? Do you want to eat me? Keep your fangs and claws to yourself. Don't yell.. One slap and I'll break all your teeth. Get out, get out, this is my parlour, get out. Shut up. I'll throw you out, you understand. Don't shout at me. You.. you'd gone to get water. Where is it? Don't talk to me Iike that. My love, please get me water. What happened? Where's the water? Go get the water yourself. What's wrong now? My show is playing on the video.. Outside. I'll go once it's over. I'll throw your cassette in the gutter. The heroine leaves only once the show is over. Have you told him I've acted in a TV show? I was the heroine. My show never aired. The channel shut shop, I had to come back here. Did you know that he hits me? He does the right thing. Get five lakh from the lot and give it to him. Tell him that's all the king gave us. And get me to speak to His Highness. What's your phone number? Give me your number? Take my address instead. Not now, later. Go back there now. Move your hand. Go. Go home now. Bhati's on his way there with the money. And don't drive me nuts Iike this again. Why did you have to go screaming to my house? You're a royal too. I have an image to Iive up to. "I pine for you, I wait for you." Forget it. You weren't thinking of withdrawing from.. ..the elections in anger I hope. No. Sure? - "Your anger mesmerizes me." "I'm bowled over by you." "I am in love with you." He's a good lad.. - Shut up! You cuddle him again.. ..I'll get the whole of Rajpur to watch you dance naked in the streets. Don't ever come back again. If you do, then I'll go away. What's for dinner? Bittu, you are not doing the right thing. That girl comes here and dopes.. What if your father finds out? Don't stir things up. Hello? You were supposed to come by my place. Okay. I see. Now, I'm coming. You want to come with me to Duki Bana's place? I need to pick up the money. Get in. Come on. - Who are you? Get in. - Lock the door. What were you doing just standing there, you idiot?! Bana, I couldn't figure out what was happening. The bike was stuck between my legs.. I couldn't see anything when Ransa went there. Should I call the police? Give me some water. - Here. Where's Ransa? I don't know Bana. Where's Jadwal? I haven't seen him for four days now.. Murari, who's kidnapped Ransa? I don't know Bana.. It's not your fault. Why do I feel so scared? I can't do anything when Ransa's not with me. Bana, I have no idea who kidnapped Ransa. I haven't, neither have my boys. If something's troubling you then please tell me. Murari's lost two fingers. I've suffered a lot. We can never get upset with you. But I must say that it's not right that any of your men can.. ..just walk up to one of ours and beat him up. It's not right. I had gone to the village when this happened. With the elections around the corner? My grandfather passed away. There is no point in kidnapping Ransa. The real high would be in beating him in the elections by 5000 votes.. ..and then I'll shave his head and parade him on a donkey. You idiot. - Shut up, you fool. Let him go. Rananjay.. Another five years and it'll be His Highness Rananjay. Don't you want to take your father's place? Is your father alive or dead? Idiot, if only you'd use your hands on the form.. ..instead of your mouth, you'd be better off. Withdraw from the elections. Is your father alive or dead? Otherwise, you'll never leave this place. Is it true that he never married your mother? You and your sister are both illegitimate, right? I'm asking you one last time. Are you going to withdraw or not? If your father had withdrawn in time.. ..you wouldn't have been illegitimate. Let me tell you the story of a time.. When the city was sleeping one deadly night.. Let me tell you the story of a time.. When the city was sleeping one deadly night.. Shadows creep in over this land from all four sides.. Creatures of night wed in blood, dance with their brides.. "Shadows creep in over this land from all four sides.." Creatures of night wed in blood, dance with their brides.. Crimson smeared on every face. A great danger at every place.. That night the skies let loose a shower of blood.. That night the city was lashed by a crimson flood.. That night the skies let loose a shower of blood.. That night the city was lashed by a crimson flood.. The city and the earth were soaked as if they'd been cursed.. A horde of men just lay there till they burst.. The world inquires why when this curse came by.. ..was our city lying in bed, eyes closed and sleeping. My sleep was deep, the city said, it knew not why.. The night a rain of blood fell thundering from the sky.. That night the city was lashed by a crimson flood.. That night the city was lashed by a crimson flood.. Deathly quiet.. Silent, alien.. Life.. Squirms in a violent bed.. Shadows collect, thick and tight.. ..Iike ruffled black tangled hair.. Darkness creep up Iike unsure ghosts.. Wrapping shakily around bedposts.. There's soft crunching of a footstep prying.. There's the faint crackle of a bonfire dying.. There's the soft howIs of the beasts of night.. There's the faint drip of a tap.. There's a window black and stark.. There's a chimney dead and dark.. There's a tree that's bent Iike a frown.. Something weighs its branches down. You are not allowed to go there.. - What? - You can't. He was my father too.. At the mouth of the desolate street, a lone dog howIs and weeps. In the pale dirty yellow Iight of the lamppost something creeps.. Tip toeing through the dark, into other shadows, a shadow seeps. When a car's hot Iight brush the legs of a bridge with two sweeps. It's then that this city sleeps. It's then that this city sleeps. It's then that this city sleeps. When this city goes to sleep, do you know what it takes? The Iiving turns to ash and dust, the dead slowly awake.. A mother lets out her last anguished scream on a hospital bed.. The next instant she's holding a small new mass of flesh instead.. Here's a wrangIing over the price of flesh for the night.. Here's two tearless eyes watching a wound disappear from sight.. In the garish hotel down the road there's a silent compromise.. From a dead-drunken stupor a joke rises. Half naked bodies are caked in colour, put on display. Red-smeared faces Iike devils, come out to play. And all of this, they ask surprised, happens when? It all happens, we'll tell them, right then. Then.. ..when the city sleeps. When the city sleeps.. When the city sleeps.. Sign this. What is this? - Sign. Where? Here. Here. The man because of whom you are here.. ..dreamt of a Rajput Rajasthan. If that girl becomes the General Secretary, it won't be good. They have killed Ransa but they cannot kill his soul. His friend, the person closest to him.. Dileep Singh will continue from where Ransa left us.. ..and fulfil promises he had made.. Dileep Singh. - Live long. - Dileep Singh. - Live long! Are you alone at that time? Everybody is there. Every candidate has his own person present there.. We have to show them that we are putting.. ..the right vote in the right basket. When the baskets are full, we take them inside to count the votes. Packs of 50 votes each are then made and counted. Ransa was my friend. I'll do everything he promised to do. I don't understand all this too well. I.. Dileep Singh! - Live long! Dileep Singh! - Live long! Dileep Singh! - Live long! Dileep Singh! - Live long! Dileep Singh! - Live long! Make packs of 40 for Dileep Singh. But count them as 50. Make packs of 60 for the girl.. ..and continue making these packs of 60 and 40. So, when you touch 500.. how many will the girl have? All packs are counted. If there is a discrepancy in the final counting.. ..we'll all get into trouble. Only the packs are counted in the final counting. And if the girl appeals for a recount.. ..then according to election rules only.. ..the number of packs will be counted.. ..the packs cannot be opened. We'll give them as much money as they want. But Dileep Singh has to win. The poet who imagines that Iife is love and peace.. Deny that poet's song.. These muscles stirred, these veins swollen.. Stoke them in fire. It's begun, it's a flood.. - Dileep Singh! A thousand heads smelling blood, it's time for the battle cry.. For the glory and the pride, give Iimb, Iife, step aside.. Its time to let arrows fly.. "Well begun is half the battle won." "Well begun is half the battle won." "Well begun is half the battle won." Looks Iike all the fIies of.. ..Rajasthan have come to Duki Bana's party. You stay here. Greetings. I've come to congratulate you. Your win is a victory for all Rajputs. It maybe small but it's still a win. Will you drink something? I'll help myself. I'm sorry I popped up uninvited. That seems Iike a birth defect. Give him a drink. One "Republic" Please.. - Yes. Water. - Yes, sir. You understand politics? - Yes. Do you even know what it means? Politics? Politics.. Dileep! I'm Kiran. I know. I couldn't defeat you. You know there's so much I want.. ..to do for this boring university of ours. I'm bursting with ideas. Yes. I can leave my party and join you. Take me in your cabinet. I'm calling it the cabinet as if we're in the Parliament. I could be the cultural secretary. I'll check. The warden wants to see you. Listen, Please open this. It's already open. Hey, get lost. Out! Where did it go? I left it right here.. Once second. What are you looking for? What one second? I don't know. I'd left it right here.. - What? I'd left it here, I can't find it. One second. Quiet, calm down. What are you looking for? What are you looking for? - What is it? Father had given it to you. I'd stolen it. Long time back. You always tried to steal it. I don't understand. It's Iike this. You cut it first. ..and then take it. It's part of something big. You cut it first and then take it. You put it on the face. Okay, you look there, I'll search here. If we don't find it, then you leave, okay? I'll have to leave? - Yes, come on. I'll leave only once I find it. Look carefully. You too. Okay, search there. - You too join me. I am telling you. It can only be here. In your room and nowhere else. It can only be here. What does he want? I don't know. - It has to be somewhere around. Have you found it? - No, don't ask me repeatedly. I wouldn't have been searching had I found it. - Yes. Come in. Listen to me. Get lost. Out. - I'll kill you! You've kicked him out. At least he would've helped. Here it is. Here it is. This is the garbage bin. Don't go there. - I know it's a dust-bin. That's garbage. - It's here. - Please.. It's right in front of your eyes.. You've found it, right? Take it and leave. Yes, I found it. Take a look. Don't ever repeat this again. Bana, please come. Kings have been relegated to stories. A revolution in this Iife.. Independence in the next.. It's said to be the prime reason. The part responsible to beat Congress.. - Grandpa.. Bana. - They were responsible for it. And a lot of them will contest the elections. This has been finalised. You are not important to Duki. He just wanted to win the elections and he did. I know. He also used Ransa's name. Two flatbreads and a plate of pilaf. That day, at the party it seemed Iike he.. ..and not me, won the elections. Bittu. - Yes. Anuja ma'am is here.. So, let her sit. She brought her luggage with her. I didn't go back to the hostel all night. They've asked me to leave. You didn't go back to the hostel. Why? Can I stay here? Of course, you can. In this room? - Yes, but Anu.. I'll carry it. How do you know her? I don't understand her. She loves you. No. Sure? Yes, the other day, I.. What I.. I don't want to know about it. Okay, ask her to meet me. Okay. But Bana that girl is with Jadwal. She is ready to leave Jadwal's group for us. What's the problem? A lot of guys can't come within sniffing distance of the.. ..kind of money a girl can attract for a festival. I'll keep it there. Get more people to join us. There won't be any problem. What do I do with this, Bana? - Keep it inside.. I'll handle it. You can come and start working as the cultural secretary. Okay? All the best. Thank you. - Mention not. Thanks! Is this your shirt? - No, it's Ransa's. What if I get pregnant? We'll get married. Be serious, Dileep. Seriously, we'll marry. What's wrong? I don't want to get married, Dileep. We are not going to get married now. I don't want to marry, ever. ..and I don't want to get pregnant. What's this? What? This. Nothing.. "Hail Lord Shiva." "Hail Lord Shiva." "Hail Lord Shiva." It's been two days since we left this room. So? Adarsh must be looking for me. Sometimes, you say you don't want to go to office. They are using Ransa's name and now this.. The work's got to get done, right? Even my brother was the General Secretary of the union. No one works there, they just make some quick bucks. Money? In the festival, that's where they play the real politics. I won't get pregnant, right? You're nuts. As if you know all about it. Shut up, Kiran. What Shut up? You realise we didn't use anything. Okay. Sir. - Yes? Some Bhati sir at the door. Ask him to sit, I'm coming out. Yes, Bhati, tell me. Need to talk to you. Say. Bana had said something to you. I remember. He wants to meet you. - He didn't come with you. He's called you to the den. I'll be there this evening. - Now. I told you I'll be there this evening. Bring her along. Why? Is he my father-in-law? What do you know about her? Bana, she is sincere. Is she the only sincere one in this world? He recommended Kiran, so, I.. Shut up. He popped the name, you seconded it. Did she come to see you too? Did she Iie beside you? He's a fool, and you're a bigger one. Why do you abuse in front of the kid? You go inside. If it's troubling you why don't you go inside? Remember this. What happens at the university, what doesn't.. I decide.. Who will decide? Who will decide? Bana, you. Who will decide? Why don't you become the General Secretary then? Bana.. Bana, leave Dileep to me, you have too much on your hands. And that girl? You have to meet her once. You don't have to appoint her. Do you even know what kind of a man Duki Bana is? He's the kind who'll have an.. ..illicit relationship even with his own wife. Meaning? Whatever. I don't want to meet him and that's it. Kiran, he'll be upset. So? You're scared of him? He said he wants to meet you. If he says it himself, go sIit your throat, would you? Please, Kiran, for my sake. What do you mean your sake? I took a stand for you, Kiran. I proposed your name. You said there was so much you wanted to do. I still do. But meeting 'your man' was not on my agenda.. ..not even for your sake. And I'm so sorry you had to take a stand for me. I'll resign tomorrow. And thank you so much for everything. Kiran. Kiran. Am I a coward? Yes. It's not a bad thing to be a coward. He looks pretty ripe. When I saw him, I felt Iike kissing him too. Shut up. I'm not lying. I've seen what she has been touching.. Ok, enough now. She is my sister. When did I say she's a call-girl? Where is Bhati? - Inside. Bhati. Bana. Welcome, Dileep. What's the matter, your glasses are gone. I'm using contact lenses. Looking handsome. Did you make the switch yourself or did ma'am have a hand in it? You called? I called in the morning. I called the girl too. I'm not that hard core either. I'm not Hitler. You could have told me. Since when have you been in it.. In what? In love. Three days. Three days.72 hours. Oh, my God. When's the wedding? I haven't thought about that. When will the honeymoon get over? What? If your honeymoon's over, can we get some work done? The general secretary's office doors.. ..have been shut for three days now. There's no work happening. The festival's around the corner. We'll need sponsorships. Who'll get the sponsorships, your dad? Rattle your bed as much as you want.. ..but once the festival's over, understood? Stop this childishness now or I'll bury you in this very cave. Even your dad won't be able to dig out of this one. What are you staring at? You think I'm joking? You think they are fools? These guys have been looking for you all day. You think they have no other work? You can make your wife your cultural or.. ..personal secretary for all I care. I want work. You're not going to get convinced this way. See this. Come back from your honeymoon. Why do you instigate him? He doesn'tjoke around. He doesn't care whether it's you or Jadwal. Look, buried him along with his gun. Don't tell anyone. Not even to your girl, understood? Nothing will happen to him. He's the leader of the Rajputs. But yes, someone might build a Taj Mahal over your grave. Don't worry. You have no reason to fear him. I'm not afraid. I'm just wondering what to do next. Nothing, just your work. The next time anyone says anything, give it back to him. You're the general secretary of this university. Notjust anyone. The entire university is with you. If anyone so much as touches you, I'll let the truth out. The annual festival's at the end of the year. I'll get the sponsorships. You give the money to Adarsh. General Secretary means that you have.. ..the entire university in your control for three years. That's what they want from you. Who were the other guys who locked you naked in that room? Wasn't Jadwal one of them? There were seven. Kishen Murari Sanjeev Kumar, AItaaf.. Ashraf, Vijay Gupta, Ashish.. And Jadwal. Have some paan (betel leaf). - Sir, what happened? Nothing. Get up. Get up and eat some paan. Sir, I don't have paan.. You don't? Don't worry you don't have to pay for it. Come on. Come on, have paan. Have it. - Can I have some catechu (choona), sir? You don't look Iike you're from Rajpur. Where are you from? Madhya Pradesh. The whole lot of you is from Madhya Pradesh. Where are you from? Gwalior. - Where's Jadwal? I don't know where. No one's seen him for a week. No one knows where Jadwal is. - Do you know? - Hit him! Ask the person who mentioned him. Hello, Inspector, what can I do for you? Just came to see you. I've brought some offerings.. ..from Baba's temple. Take this please. - Okay. Please sit. This.. Just some routine inspection. Do you remember that boy called Jadwal? Yes. Where is he? I don't know. You own some property in Chandpur. Actually the thing is that.. you know you're a Bana.. ..but we have to follow orders, have to investigate. Who told you this? No one. - Dileep Singh. No, no. He's just a kid. He's a kid, right? Which idiot decided to nominate him for the elections? Whose idea was it Bana, mine. Then take him to Jadwal. - He's alive. Come. Where are you taking me? Relax. We are not going to do anything to you. No. - Come. Come. I've brought the entire force. They've left. What? Come on, go downstairs. Go. There's been some confusion. There's no confusion. - Can't the police just come to meet Duki Bana? Come on, go downstairs! Thank you. I'll take your leave now. Come on. - I'll become corrupt. Shoot! What are you doing? So corrupt that Bana will make me his watchman. Bhati pointing the gun. - You do it! Shoot. - Shut up, you guys. Stop rambling. Okay, but one last request. Can I remove my uniform? I love it to death. if it gets stained, I.. Take off his uniform and bury him. They have flown away. Should we also.. Bana. Please let us go. The world outside must be very interesting. Bana, you know you aren't allowed to go outside. Yes, I know. I forget sometimes. I'll go this way. You room's that way. I am not alone in that house. I've forgotten the path. Come along. How many here.. - Eight million. That's it? - That's all we have so far. The King of Soorajgarh has sent fifteen million. He's made a final offer on the cement factory sale. 40 million. Just 40? - But Bana.. Refuse. - But Bana.. I said no. Forget him. Dileep. Dileep. Coming. - Come out quickly. If it's so urgent why don't you come inside? This is not a joke. Come out quickly. I'd given you five cheques of Rs.200,000 each. Yes. - And Rs.70,000 in cash. I had given all of it to Adarsh. He says there's just 270,000 in the festival account. How can that be? - That is the way it is. Hello. - Is Adarsh there? Dileep here. I'll call him. I'll ask the idiot. He must have given the money to Duki Bana. I'll tear that Duki Bana to pieces some day. What happened? Hello.. - Hello Yes, Dileep, tell me I had given you a million. One.. one minute. Kiran. Hello. Kiran's with you. - Yes. She told me that the money.. Duki Bana has the money. He's kept it for the party. That money came from the sponsors not.. ..for the party, for the festival. Whatever you want to say, speak to Duki Bana. What happened? She is pregnant. Kiran. I had told you to use protection. I don't want to get pregnant. I don't want to bring another illegitimate child into this world. Kiran, I.. What, what are you going to do now? Lousy irresponsible man, what have you done? I didn't do it intentionally. Oh, it happened all by itself. Everything's a joke to you. - Kiran. What difference does it make to him? He's a man after all. Kiran. Don't get hyper. It's done now. It happened with me, not you. You're sure you're pregnant? Dileep, what are you saying? She missed her menses. I hate you, Dileep. Dileep take her to a doctor. She's a month pregnant. It needs to be aborted. When can it be done? Can it be done today? I'll be back. What do you want to speak to Duki Bana about? Yes, Dileep, tell me.. Where are the other 800,000.. Meaning.. - You've kept 800,000 from the festival fund. Yes, so.. Who the hell do you think you are asking these questions from? That money had been collected for the festival.. ..from the sponsors.. That money's spent. Spent? Meaning? It's spent, blown up. What else does that mean? That money wasn't for you to mess around with. Dileep. - Have you gone nuts? Was the money yours? Did you bring it? Why is it hurting you? Was it your money? You want to see how I mess around.. ..which places I go to. Where I blow up the money.. What songs I sing.. You want to see all these? Bring him along. We'll show him. But Bana, we.. Come on, Dileep. Come on. Prithvi Hail Rajputana! Go, go inside. Go on. No one's going to rape you. Step in. Your shirt.. take it off and wear this. At this point, we have only Our army numbers merely eleven hundred and twenty six. Forget the storm we spoke of. We can't even kick up a breeze. If things go on Iike this, we'll take another.. ..ten years to come anywhere close to our goal. Till then, our revolution will stay buried under the ground.. And here, the king of Karangarh has sent his son abroad to study. Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch.. And also, he's showering him with loads of money. If you can't include your own sons and grandsons in this revolution.. ..then should I hire revolutionaries from Kashmir. if we sit doing nothing, we'll never be.. ..able to bring about a revolution. It's no use gathering here and wasting each other's time. If you really want a revolution, you will have to rub your faces.. ..crimson with blood, not red powder. You'll have to empty your coffers. If you want a real revolution then wipe the colour off your.. ..face and show your true self. Or quit pretending. Hail Rajputana. Who am I? Prithvi Bana. How did you know? Then you must have recognised.. ..every coloured face gathered there. Yes. Then what's the point in colouring your faces? Tell me. Tell me. I have a better idea. What? This goes on the face and a bit of red powder on your back side. You'll all look the same, only then can you become one.. One Rajputana. Come on. - I should make them stand naked in the hot sun. I am putting in such a lot of effort.. ..and they are doing nothing. Like statues. OId bones cannot help in our revolution.. CIimb up so high that you stand at the peak of the Himalayas.. ..and then God himself asks, so, tell me, you fool. How're you going to climb down? You had gone too. Yes. Didn't enjoy it. What'll they get by doing all this? Ask him who took you there. Do you still want the money? I wont be able to do all of this, Bana. What? I had come here to study So? I'm leaving. Are you really a Rajput or a coward.. I'm talking to you, face me. I messed up by trusting him. They told me, you are an idiot. What you are doing is not a revolution.. ..it's lunacy. Rajasthan doesn't belong to Rajputs alone. What? Who taught him this.. Don't speak Iike a government servant. I'll smash your face. What makes you so sure that you won't fight amongst.. ..yourselves once you get your Rajputana? And break up again into a Mevar, Marwad, Jaipur and Jaisalmer.. There's no guarantee. Come. Come. I've been looking for the land of the valiant since god-knows-when. Prithvi Bana, stop it. - Come on, from here. Practice makes a man perfect. - Leave this place. I'll kill you! Duki don't touch him. I said, Duki don't touch him.. Let him go. Leave him or. Lay your hands off him. We took Pakistan by right, we'll take Hindustan by force. No one should get in the way now.. I'm taking away Rajputana too, understood? Come, give me a beat. It's a sale, it's a sale. Every coin knows who'll use it. Every grain knows who chews it. Come one, come all. It's a sale. One price 25. One price 25. Buy Kashmir.. - It's a sale.. Buy Assam. - It's a sale.. - Buy Punjab.. It's a sale.. - Buy a slave.. It's a Sale.. - So, do you want it, Duki? It's a sale.. it's a sale.. Religion is the opium and you're it's agent. Your mother's husband asks who's your father. How will you prove it? It's a sale. Enough. - Get out! - Listen to me. Enough, Bana! Use your own guns. Come on! My ancestors have shed their blood for this land. Rajputs have lain their Iives down for it. Don't try to explain my revolution to me. If you want to study, study history. We've always been denied justice. We have been betrayed. Get it on with the girl, that's all you're good for. Bana! Give justice but give just half of it.. ..and if even that seems too much.. ..give just five grams of it. Save. Keep your country bountiful. We'll be happy with just that much. And won't even point fingers at those who keep the rest. Even Duryodhan could not give freely. Never received the blessings of his people.. ..instead he tried to rein Lord Krishna in. - Bana! Lord Krishna was furious. He appeared before him, quaking with anger and said.. Bring the chains forth, he said. Duryodhan, bind me, he said.. Look down heavens, I have the touch.. Pause wind, look, I have the touch. Every note resides within me every.. ..corner's contained within me. Every soul of me is born. Each one returns to me when torn. Here, each day of the Mahabharat was spent. Here's where the world began, will end. Lined with corpses, yes, it's true. Can you see yourself Iie here too? Bana.. Next time, Bana.. John Lenon everywhere! Burn it. It's done. Prepare for the funeral.. Bana, why do you do it? Aren't you scared of him.. A disbeliever fears only the storms. I'm a disbeliever. Who's Madhuri? What? Who's Madhuri, tell me who is Madhuri? Don't turn away. Answer my question. I want an answer, tell me who is Madhuri, I want to know! Madhuri is who you can never be. Don't irritate me.. That.. Kiran.. She's gone. Her brother picked her up. The doctor didn't allow me to meet her. Kiran had left instructions. Hello. Is this Kiran's residence? This is Dileep.. What happened? Dileep's here. You're the General Secretary? You resigned, I took up the post. Why didn't you tell me? Kiran you have no idea. These people.. Dileep, if you've got something important to say, then talk.. We have a lot of work. Can I talk to you in private? No. I'm sorry about whatever happened, Kiran. It won't happen again. Please don't get angry. Dileep, please leave. It'll be good for you.. ..if you leave peacefully One minute! - Let's go! Why did you rub red powder on Ransa's face? Jadwal did. Why? You had said something to Murari. Something about hanging him in.. ..the market square Iike Najibullah in Kabul. He wanted to answer you. You'll would have been cremated the same day as your father. The only reason you'll are here alive is.. ..because of sir. Remember that. My Sire.. He fIies into a rage my sire, rants, raves.. Spits fire, causes me pain. "My Sire fIies into a rage.." "Rants, raves, spits fire, causes me pain." Just Iike the towers that got struck by the planes. Just Iike the towers that got struck by the planes. "My Sire fIies into a rage.." "Rants, raves, spits fire, causes me pain." Just Iike the towers that got struck by the planes. Just Iike the towers that got struck by the planes. My sire growIs, grumbles, simmers and then.. ..rumbles, leaves me teary-eyed. Just Iike a raging Uncle Sam strikes in.. ..the dead of the night. "Just Iike a raging Uncle Sam strikes in the dead of the night." "My sire.." My in-laws give me grief.. ..taunt me beyond belief. I'm haunted by ghouls and ghosts.. ..I am under an evil spell. My sire calls his girl a 'dear..' His locals brew a 'beer.' He craves an EngIish tongue.. ..in more ways than one! An EngIish Jaipur and an EngIish Bikaner. As if mineral water from a bottle.. ..makes him an EngIishman. As if mineral water from a bottle.. ..makes him an EngIishman. "My sire.." He brought the 'other' woman home instead.. He brought the 'other' woman home instead.. She's just a friend, he said. She's just a friend, he said. He unsheathed his sword and.. He unsheathed his sword and.. It was cold Iike a coca cola! It was cold Iike a coca cola! Now, feathers are ruffled, there's furore. Now, feathers are ruffled, there's furore. Now, feathers are ruffled, there's furore. This heart is screaming out for more.. I've been shamed in the market square. My dress has been stained with a tear. My heart thuds louder and louder through the night.. ..just Iike democracy, trying to speak.. ..with its mouth shut tight. Just Iike democracy, trying to speak.. ..with its mouth shut tight. "Just Iike the towers that got struck by the planes." "Just Iike the towers that got struck by the planes." "Just Iike a raging Uncle Sam strikes in the dead of the night." "Just Iike a raging Uncle Sam strikes in the dead of the night." "And Afghanistan.." "And Afghanistan was ruined." "And Afghanistan was ruined." "Just Iike the towers that got struck by the planes." - "My Sire.." Where's the key? Why are you staring at me Iike this. What did I do now? If you didn't then you surely.. ..would have, had I not reached there in time. What have you taken me for? Dileep wasn't as big an idiot as that girl made him out to be. You aren't playing this game, she is. She's playing with you and you're letting her. Where have I kept my car keys? You aren't Iistening to me. I know what she is and what she isn't, don't patronise me. Where are the car keys? You couldn't tell me earlier. I did, but you never Iisten. You danced very well today. Drop Madhuri home. Who's that lousy woman? She's a lethal one. Bana just doesn't Iisten.. He's the leader of the revolution. Tomorrow, it could be Karan's turn. Who's Karan? - The fellow who was with the girl. Her brother.. He's a Bana too. Not yet, he will be. He killed Ransa so he could become one. They aren't idiots by birth alone. You should try to drive some sense into Duki Bana's head. Does he ever Iisten to me? He'll have to or you'll lose him. If I hadn't followed her, she would have had him.. ..in no time at all.. Come in, sir. Hanif.. Yes, sir.. - How come Bana's vehicle is still here? Yes, sir, he left with Kiran in her car. Come on, let's go. That idiot.. What happened ma'am? Bhati, look here.. Yes, Ma'am. Do I look Iike that filmstar, Tabu? Of course, you do. You aren't lying, are you? No, ma'am. Then what does that Kiran have? Can she dance the way I do? Can she love the way I do? Can she take a beating? What does she have then? Look away. She never loved you, Dileep. She is just angry because I got her pregnant. Adarsh and Duki Bana have incited her. They couldn't fool me with his nonsense.. ..so now they're trying it on Kiran. Kiran has no idea what those guys are about. You love her so much that you don't see her. She knows everything. She's innocent. She wasn't meant for you. Where are you going now? "Settle in my dreams." "Make me besotted by you." You fool, why are you here? Leave me, you fool! Leave me! Leave me! Dileep.. What did you say to her? To whom? To Kiran. You must have said something to her.. ..at the hospital that made her leave. You didn't Iike my being with her, did you? If she wasn't meant for me then who was, you? Why are you looking away? Look at me, you lousy woman. If she wasn't meant for me then who was, you? "Money is everything." "The one I left behind.." "..hasn't changed at all." The wind, it punishes me. Even my.. ..loneliness is not lonely enough. You're up this early. Haven't you slept? I was waiting for you. I had gone to Madhuri's house. You weren't there either. What had you gone to do there? Meet you. It was the first day of the Diwali festival yesterday. Little crackers kept bursting inside my heart. So, I thought It was time I burst a big one. Bhanwar. Make me some tea. Anuja ma'am has left. So, what do I do? I'm leaving too. So, you're doing me a favour by telling me. Get lost. I didn't get a chance to tell you last night, but Bittu.. ..I was five-years-old when you were born. If ever anyone understood you better than.. ..your father or your brother, it was Anuja. She made you her friend despite your shortcomings. She has lost nothing, you have. You want people who want you to change. Look what you've become because of them. But Anuja ma'am Iiked you just the way you were. She was the one who got your friend, Ransa killed. She's the daughter of the same King. She's no woman. She's a lousy woman. Don't abuse her. If you don't believe me, go see for yourself. How she's stuck to Duki Bana. Look. Look at this. This isn't make-up.. That idiot Duki thrashed me because of that lousy woman. You still think I'm lying. Then go see for yourself. I swear on Ransa. Where are you going? Listen to me first. Hear me out. I'm not lying! "Oh, Lord." "Oh, Lord." "Oh, Lord." "Oh, Lord." It's still fresh in our memories. That melodious world.. Coloured balloons in our hot fists. That fragrant time. "Oh, Lord." "Oh, Lord." It was a world of dreams. A world of books. Of shivers in each breath. And intoxicated eyes. "Oh, Lord." "Oh, Lord." There was the earth, the sky. But we didn't know.. Where we stood.. ..was the brink of a deep, dark well. In a crowd they came. In every hand a gleaming dagger. Screaming 'throw down those books.' And step inside a prison cell. This deep dark well.. ..is not dark at all. There's a treasure here. A new world for us all. Jump in with daggers drawn. Kill whoever is inside. You're the warriors we seek. The Alexanders of tomorrow. Go see.. We just did what they told us to do. We fulfilled their desire. We don't know why, what, who.. I want to talk to Kiran. Put that gun down. Dileep, I need to talk to Kiran. Dileep, you've gone insane? Shut up! I want to speak to Kiran. "The blood.." Kiran isn't here.. Call her then. Call her.. What if I don't? Shut up! It's a happy day in Rajasthan. The freedom party has won the elections. And all their kings and princes have returned victorious. Bana. Bana.. Bhati, call her. Bhati, call her. I want to talk to her. Have you gone insane? Call her. - Okay. - I want to talk to her. - I'm calling her here. I'm not going anywhere. I want to speak to her in your presence. Okay. - Call her. Bhati, don't call her. You stay quiet. All this is happening because of you. - Bhati. I told you so many times not to meet that girl. Bhati! Call her. - Yes, I'm telling her. I'm calling her. - Go. Go. Yes, I'm going. She doesn't love you. She didn't realize it yet. Stop talking Iike a kid. You snatched her away from me. She got Ransa killed. Gaurav killed her. He is also using her. What! Me talk to your president. The president of United States of America. What you persons have done to the middle east? Bana. . We are not able to celebrate our Diwali because of the bad eye Bana. - You have taken the entire oil wells. One minute. Bana. Bana. One minute. Hello! Yes, Sanjeev. Now Iisten.. There is that girl.. What is her name? Yes, Kiran. Tell her to call Dukhi Bana. Immediately. I am her father speaking and yours as well. Got it? Now make the call fast. I am a senior Cambridge student.. ..and don't try to teach me what America is all about. What happened? - Nothing. Just Iike that.. You carry on with worshipping. I'll be back. Where is he? - He is there downstairs. One minute. Come here. Don't let anyone go out. Got it? No one will go out. Got it? Till I return. All of them are cowards. No one has the courage to come forward. If Dukhi dies.. ..they have no one who can become their commander-in-chief. And to make me the commander-in-chief they will have.. ..to give father's name.. As long as Bhati is there.. ..it's tough to kill Dukhi. Dilip. Dilip, talk to her on phone. She'll make a call. - I don't want to talk to her on phone. I want to talk to her in front of you. Ok, talk to her. By the time she comes here Bana will die. Bhati, tell her to come here. Bhati, tell her to come here. Tell her to come here. What will you do by calling her here? You will give away the bride? We have to remove Bhati from our path. Hello! One minute. Bhati's call. Dukhi Bana wants to talk to Kiran Shah. Tell him she can't meet her. Kiran can't meet him. Ok. AIright. Bhati is coming to union office. You know with how many men she has slept? I want to hear it from her. You think a lot. You don't want to accept that she used you. Karan made her to do that on your insistence. On my insistence? Why did you need to make Ransa contest the elections? You.. It was not my decision. It was Raja Saheb's. Which Raja Saheb, Bana? His Highness Mrityunjay Singh. The founder of Rajputana. Ransa's father. He too made the same mistake that my father did with Prithvi Bana.. For schooling he was sent to England.. ..to John Lenin's.. As desperately as you seek Kiran, Dilip.. ..I want Rajputana even more. What if I had gone and told everything to police? You wouldn't have told them. Why? Because you are a nice guy. When I can kill Jadwal.. ..imagine what could have I done to you. Can you fetch me some water? After the imposition of this ban.. ..this is the second suicide.. ..where before shooting himself the victim told his relative.. ..Indira Gandhi's 'Garibi Hatao' (End poverty) scheme. ..is in reality a.. Sandeep. Sandeep. Sandeep. I'll see. Sanjeev. I need to talk to you, Kiran. In private. You have gone crazy, Dilip. I have not gone crazy, Kiran. You have made me crazy. You did. I can't talk to you for two minutes. You know what people are saying about you? I don't love you, Dilip. You are lying. - I am not lying. You are forcing me to Iie. Weren't you in love with me? - No, I wasn't. Then what was all that? Nothing. It was nothing for you, Kiran, but it was everything for me. Remove the gun, Dilip. Dilip, you won't understand it. Then make me understand it. I wanted to become the GS. It was just for that? To become the GS. You could've told me once. You are saying that today, Dilip. It wouldn't have been so easy for you to resign. Dukhi would've never let you do that. You could've at least told me once, Kiran. Forget Dukhi even his father couldn't have done anything. Whatever you would've done he would've never let me become the GS. Kiran, today you are the GS because of him. Yes. Because he will do anything for me today. You used me to reach Dukhi? You. Adarsh. Which other name do you want to know? Adarsh? You don't know how it feels when everyone laughs at you. They call my mother Raja Saheb's concubine. Ransa was your brother? He was just my father's son. I have only one brother. Kiran, the same brother is using you. Everyone is using you. Who told you that I am not using everyone? Kiran, you are also coming with me. Remove the gun, Dilip. Remove the gun, Dilip. Go away from here. Go. Kiran. "O world.." "O world.." "O world.." "The world of beautiful, intoxicating eyes.. O world!" "The world of beautiful, intoxicating eyes.. O world!"
