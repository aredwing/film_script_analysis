I was a slave of the demon rum. A child of hell! Yes, sir. But I was saved by this ribbon. It raised me from a hog to a man. It can do the same for you. Raise your right hand and take the pledge. Brother, what do I see in your hand? Don't be a hog! Cast the enemy away! Bury demon rum in the waters of the mighty Mississippi! Fling it away, I say! I swear that henceforth... liquor shall never touch my lips. -Me too. -Bless you, brother. Bless you. Look at that. You see that? See that picture on there? Yeah, that's Pocahontas, the wonderful little... Indian woman. You know, you all know the story of Pocahontas. You know? That saved John Smith's life, you know? Well, John Smith wanted to get this remedy from... Pocahontas, you know? Course, it's just made out of pure roots and herbs... that she picked up on the hillside. But she wouldn't give him this remedy. He couldn't get it. He had to marry her to get it. Oh, yes, he did. He had to marry her to get the remedy. And that's how it got into the Smith family. And that's been handed down from generation to generation... from Smith to Smith right on down... and that's how it come clear down to me. -My great-grandmother was a Smith. -Mine too, Doc! I doubt it. Say, lookee here. Lookee here, my friend. You don't look good. Now, you are ill. You are sick, and you don't know it. Well, l-I do feel kind of bad, Doc. I knew it. I could just look at you- Would you mind stepping up here? Just get up here on the platform, will ya? Now, you folks know that this man is no confederate of mine. I never saw him before. Now, along in the spring, just about the time... you should go to plowin'... why, you feel kind of tired, don't you? You're right, Doc. And you know that I'm right, don't you? You know what that is? That's spring sickness,... that's what it is. It's spring sickness, and the only thing that'll cure... that is Pocahontas. Pocahontas. You know, the main thing about Pocahontas is... that you can't do a tap of work... you're not allowed to turn a hand until the whole bottle is empty. You mean, I can't even sharpen the ax for the old woman to cut wood? Why, you can't even hitch up the mules for her. I'll take a bottle, Doc. Its 50 cents a bottle. l-I haven't got change for... that dollar here. You don't mind just takin' another bottle, do you? Because, you know, you're gonna be tired during the summer... and that'll carry you over till I get back. Now, who else wants a bottle? You don't have to work. You can lay off anytime. I've got a few. Complete relaxation while you're taking it. Here you are. Who'll have another bottle here? Hey, Doc, let me have one of them two bits. Im awful sorry, lady. I haven't got any more of... the 10-cent ones. They're all 25 cents, ma'am. I didn't have enough. There you are. Who'll have another? -Morning, Captain Eli. -Hello, Doc. Make yourself at home. Say, what in thunder are you doin'? Im just teaching you how to salute my boat. The Claremore Queen. Look at her layin' over there. Yeah. Give her two more toots. Say, that's four. -That's a-That's a double salute. -No. Just honoring the unburied dead, that's all. Yeah, don't-don't try to poke any fun at that. Duke and I just bought it. We saved up every nickel we got to get that boat. Duke? That's your nephew, ain't it? You bet your life. And he's a great boy, Duke. I thought he was pilot on the Memphis Girl. Well, he was. He's the main pilot on there. But not no more. He's making his last trip... and then he's comin' right on there with me. You stick to doctoring. You ain't no steamboat man. Cramp her, Mink. Cramp her. Ill take her, Mink. Well, admittin' Duke's a pretty good boy... what could you do on a steamboat? Well, Im just gonna sit up in the pilot's house... and toot the whistle and listen to that old river sing. The way you brag, I suppose... you're fixin' to stick that old apple crate yonder... in the big race to Baton Rouge this summer. I never had thought of that. But that's an idea at that. You know, the Claremore Queen won that race in '84. And with... And with Duke as a pilot... Ill bet she could win it again. I suppose you'd like to bet your boat against my boat... on the result of that race, huh? Well, l-I don't know. Well, Ill bet you at that. Ill bet you. You made yourself a bet and lost yourself a steamboat. Come up and get it. Come on. Good-bye, folks. Good-bye. Ain't you gonna stay ashore here with us, brother? The devil's pretty active around these parts. Nay, brother. The Lord's a-callin' me up the river. Gotta wrestle with the captain of the Memphis Girl. He's backslid. Well, durn my britches! The Memphis Girl, huh? Say, Ive got a nephew works on that boat. You need anybody to help you wrestle with the devil,... he'll help you. He's the best wrestler in this whole country. His name's Duke. Duke's his name. Yes, sir. He's pilot of the boat. Thank you, brother. Ill fetch him the word. You tell him to hurry on down here. I ain't... any man to be kept waitin'. Good-bye, brother. Keep the faith. You can count on me, Moses. I ain't got no more use for liquor. Hey, Doc! That's two bottles you got. Cost you a dollar. I ain't got any money, Doc, but I can work it out. -'Work it out.' What can you do? -Steamboat engineer. Yeah? Steamboat engineer? Are you an engineer? Huh? Say, boy, you just drunk yourself into a job. Come on in here. Well, engineer, what do you think of it? Kind of looks as though a lot of rats have to... find themselves a new hole. Well, of course it don't look so good right now. But you got to remember that... Well, a steamboat... is a female, you know? And when they're struttin' up and down the river where... everybody's lookin' at 'em... they're just like a woman with a new Easter bonnet on. But when nobody ain't lookin' at 'em, why... they get kind of careless and don't care. -Yeah-sloppy. -Sloppy. That's right. But with a-with a good, live man on this boat like you are... say, you can make this thing perk up and strut. Get some paint on her nose and get these chickens out of here. We can put them right in the pot now. Here. Here. Start flirtin' with that. But, Doc, you told me yourself that a... man couldn't do a lick of work when he's on Pocahontas. Oh, that's the first bottle. But after that... you've got to work to get the best results out of it. Now, hurry up. Duke's gonna be here any day now... and he'll be here. Ooh! Look at that. It says 'Captain.' It says 'Captain' on it. Ain't that great? Oh, uh-Oh, no. No, no. Now, listen. We'll find a sign painter up the... river somewhere... and Ill-we'll have 'Chief Engineer'... put on there, see? And if I have any room, you know... and you work good, we'll put 'First Mate.' Come on, now. Let's get goin'. Hurry up. That you, Duke? -Hello, Uncle John. -Hey, you're kind... of late, ain't you? I guess I am, Uncle John. Who-Who's that... This is Fleety Belle, Uncle John. She-She- She's a swamp gal, ain't she? Oh, I guess that's right. But... But there's some mighty fine people in the swamps. You're actin' awful queer, Duke. You done some thin' bad, ain't ya? Mighty bad, Uncle John. What'd you do? I killed a man. Well, was it on account of her you done it? Yes, sir. Can Fleety Belle sit down and get dry, Uncle John? Guess so. Half the Claremore Queen's yours, ain't it? Its all right, Fleety Belle. Uh, you all ain't had nothin' to eat, have you? I'd mighty like something for Fleety Belle. She's about worn out. I got- I got some hot coffee here. Ill get some bacon in a minute. Where'd you meet her? Well, there ain't much to tell. We was down at Blue Bottom Bayou back of... Hannan gettin' out timber. Some swamp people come along in their shanty boats. I used to wave at 'em, tryin' to be friends with 'em. But they'd never wave back or nothin'. Just make their womenfolk get indoors. First time I seen Fleety Belle, I... I thought she was a boy the way she was dressed. Well, I blowed my whistle... and-and she waved back. And her old man came out and gave her a whippin'. After that, I seen her pretty near every, day. Then her folks found out, and her old man gave... her a worse whippin; And that's why she run away. -Was it one of her kinfolks you killed? -No, sir. -It was Big Steve. -Who's he? Engineer on the Memphis Girl. When he found Fleety Belle on the steamboat... where I was hiding her... he started after her. You know I don't get mad easy, but... but when I do, it's like a-like a thorn tree... a-growin' and growin' inside of me, and- Well, we started in fightin'. He drawed a knife... and I picked up a chunk of stove wood and... throwed it at his hand. And he ducked right into it, and I knowed... by the way he fell that he was dead. Well, then, ain't nobody can say that that wasn't self-defense. -Did anybody see it? -Nobody but a-a preacher fella. -Calls hisself the New Moses. -I know 'im. I know him. He come up on the Pride of Paducah with me. I sent a message to you by him. Did he give it to you? Yeah, he told me. -He-He seen it, huh? -He seen it. And it was night, and he was sleepin' on deck. He didn't blame me none. Just done a lot of prayin'... and told me to give myself up. I don't know nothin about religion. But he's right. He-He's right. You gotta give yourself up. There ain't no jury could blame you for... doin' a thing like that. Now, come on. Come on and sit down there. Come sit down. Get you something to eat here now. Then we'll go on over. We'll see the sheriff,... and you can give yourself up. No! He ain't gonna give his self up. Listen here. Who asked for any opinion of... yours on this thing? You've done enough to him already. Now, sit down there and get you something to eat. He's gonna do as I say. He knows that he can trust me. No, he ain't gonna do what you say. We heard tell of this hangin' judge. Ain't nobody gonna hurt Duke. -Sit down! -Sit down, Fleety Belle. Eat some thin'. Uncle John's right. There ain't no thin' to run away from. I told you not to come here. We'd be safe in the swamp. Aw, swamps! He's a river man. He couldn't live in the swamps. He's not that kind of people. But they'll hang you, Duke. I know they will! Aw, they won't do any such a thing. They won't hang him. Don't pay any attention to her, Duke. She'll... only get you in worse. You shut up and stop sayin' that! You're just thinkin' of yourself! You don't care what... happens to Duke! Now, honey, Uncle John is- I ain't never had no thin' to love in my life, and... Im not gonna let 'em take you. Nobody's gonna take me away from you, honey... except maybe for a little while. You and me gotta be free to get married and-and... live on this boat. lf you don't come with me now, you'll never see me again. Come on, son. Let's get on over and see the sheriff. -You let him alone! -Now, honey- -Come on, son. -I know why you're doin' this. Its because you hate me, and you think I ain't... good enough for him. Comin', Duke? Im comin', Uncle John. But you've gotta take care of Fleety Belle while Im gone. Rufe? Rufe? Sure is quiet up here. Sleeps right upstairs there. See if I can wake him up here. Rufe? Hello down there. Well, good heaven Betsy. What are you doin' down there this time of night,... Doc? Can't you let a man sleep? Come on down. Duke... Duke killed a man. Well, doggone me. Who was it, Duke? Somebody I knowed? Fella named Big Steve. -Never heard of him. -Come on-Come on down, Rufe. Now, Doc, there ain't no need of me comin' down them stairs. Wait just a minute. Ill fix you up. Here you be, Duke. Now just open her up and make yourself at home. Take the first bed you take a liking to. And, Doc... just hang the keys on the front doorknob, will ya? Ill be seein' you in the mornin' now about breakfast time. Good night. Huh. You'd think somebody killed a man every day around here... and come and give their self up. Hey, you. Girl! Come on inside here now. Supper's about ready. Sit down. -Sit down! -I ain't go in' to! You sit down! I don't want nobody wait in' on me. I know you hate me, and I don't care. Duke told me to stay here, and Im gonna do it. As soon as he gets out, him and me's goin' away. And we ain't comin' back neither. Maybe you're goin' away, but he ain't. Yes, he is. Now, we'll see about that. I never knew of any good... comin' of a river man get tin' mixed up with swamp trash. Hey, look out there! Hey. You know-Say, you're a... You're a spunky little rascal, you know it? You- You kind of got to admire you at that. -There she is! -Just wait till I get you home. -No, I ain't a-go in'! -Ill beat the hide... off of you for this... runnin' off with a river man, shamin' me in... the face of the Lord. Makin' trash out of herself. I don't know as I want... to marry her now. She'll marry you, Ben, after Pop gives her a good whoppin'. -Oh, I won't! I won't! I won't! -You'll shut up! Darn you! Ill beat the livin'... -Hold on there! -Go ahead and beat me! That's all I ever knowed. Take me back. But I won't marry him, and you can't make me. Ill run away, and Ill... Ill keep on doin' it till you kill me! Now, you listen to me. And you don't have to go anywhere. -Oh, shut up! -He's just lookin' for trouble. Go ahead. Give it to him. Ain't no sin runnin' off with the man you love... and ain't nobody gonna make me say it is. You heard what she said. Now, go on! Get out of here! -Hit him in the chin, Pop! -Ill bust him one! Go ahead, Ben. Don't take none of his sass. Ain't no river man gonna tell me what to do. She's my young 'un, and I got the right. There ain't nobody gonna tell her what to do but Duke. -Im her pa. -Yes, and Duke is her husband. Her and Duke... Her and Duke was married. There can't be no thin' wrong about that, can there? He's lyin', Pap! I ain't a-gonna marry her now no how. I don't want... no river man's trash! You bet your life you're not a-gonna. Say, just a minute here. Say, Ive stood just about all the insults... Im gonna stand out of you people. You can't come in here talkin' to that girl like that. That's Duke's wife. -Now get out of here, you swamp trash! -Now, wait a minute. -Put that down. -Come on, you swamp rats! Get out of here! -Look, Pappy! There's my shoes. -Hey, drop them shoes! Ow! Fine lot of kinfolks you got. Id mighty like to thank you for what you've done. Well, you oughta thank me. Hadn't been for me, they'd have got your shoes. -But-But, I mean, you fixed it... -Well, yes. lf you hadn't give me the knife, they might have... got 'em anyhow. Com in' in here bother in' us just when we're gonna enjoy... our supper here together. Hmph. That's a fine lot of kinfolks havin'... like that. Swamp people. Look at that bacon. Look at that. Its all burned. Look. Look at that. Let me fix it. Huh? What do you know about coo kin' bacon? I bet you never did cook no thin' but catfish. Hey, what is that-Here. What is that? Is that-Is that an old tablecloth... of somebody's? Huh? What is it? You can't wear a thing like that to the court- You can't wear... You can't wear that to the courtroom. You've got to... No wonder Duke couldn't tell whether you was a boy or a girl. Look at that. Sure used to make them Yanks run in that. Look at that. Huh? That belonged to... That belonged to Duke's mother. She was the prettiest woman I ever saw in my life... even if she was my sister. She was a skinny little thing, just like you. There you go. There you go. Lettin' the bacon burn up that way. That's all you women think about... just clothes. Dr. John, do you think any body'll take me for a swamp girl? Swamp girl? What, in those clothes? No more swamp girl. Say, there's gals up in the big city... like-like Vicksburg that ain't got duds like those. You know where those clothes come from? Way up to Memphis. Do you think... Do you think Duke'll like it? Like it? Say, he ain't even gonna recognize you at first. Duke's gonna have two sweethearts now. -Two? -Yeah. Gonna have two. You and the Claremore Queen. Say, we gotta hurry up here. Let's get to prancin' here. Come on. 'Twas me done this to Duke. Its all my fault. I ought to let him run away like you said. You was right about that hangin judge. Guess I thought 'cause I was older... that l-I knew more about right and wrong than you all did. Duke ain't blamin' you, Dr. John. I know he ain't. But you are. I ain't blamin' nobody. You ain't no more surprised about it than I be, Doc. Aw. You up there supposed to be savin' a man's life. Then you're talkin' to the judge about real estate. What'd you wanna start an argument with him for? Well, 'tweren't my fault. You seen the way he led around to it. He's held a grudge against me ever since I sold... him that bottom land. 'Tweren't my fault the river run over it. Oh, well, if you'd let me have my way and let me go find the... New Moses who's the only man that saw the thing- Had him here as a witness, Duke could've been free... and out of here. Aw, shucks. He ain't been hung yet. Just wait and see the way I handle this appeal. I tell you... You just wait a minute now. You ain't gonna handle any appeal. You know what I want you to do? I want you to go down to... Baton Rouge and I want you to get a... get a good lawyer. Get the best lawyer you can get. Get a-Get a smart lawyer. Cost a heap of money. Them big fellows wouldn't even worry about Duke... for less than $500. Five hundred dollars? Well, if his life ain't worth $500, it ain't worth nothin'. You go get the lawyer, will ya? You get the lawyer. Ill get the $500 somehow or another. Come on, honey. Howdy, Doc! Oh, hello, Rufe. Mighty sorry to hear about the way Duke's case turned out. Well, ain't hung him yet. That's the truth as I see it. They ain't goin' to either. What-What's that you got there? Why, ain't you heard? Why, Professor Marvel done... skipped town owin' everybody. Left his whole show and the calliope and everything. Come on in and see the show, honey. It'll cheer you right up. They got a dead fish in here. They call it a whale. Why, the whole tent's just chuck full of things... that'll give you the shivers. Come on in. Yes, sir. All the greatest folks in history, from John the Baptist... plumb down to the king of England. There's Little Eva sittin' there. Old Uncle Tom's layin' around here somewheres. You know the story of Little Eva, honey? -No. -Well, just as well. Oh, here. Lookee. Its Daniel Boone. -That Daniel Boone? -That's Daniel Boone. You-You know the story of Daniel Boone? -No. -Ill tell you that sometime. That's a-That's a great story. Oh, here. Look here. Ill bet that's the old bloodhound,... ain't it, Sheriff? Huh? Got ya there, Doc. Lookee here. You see that statue there? -Uh-huh. -That's Ulysses S. Grant. -Yeah? Who's that? -Oh. -The woman leadin' the horse? -Yeah. Why, that's Victory,. Ain't it just like some durned Yankee to let the lady walk? They do it every time. But lookee here, Doc. Ill bet you this here's somethin' that you ain't... never seen before. There's been a heap of argument around town... about this here whale. And Professor Marvel, now, he claimed that... it's the very identical whale that swallowed Jonah. Well, it looks old enough to be. Yes, and look here at the size of this here mouth. Ain't nobody in here. Thunderation! Ain't nobody in here, white folks. -Holy Moses! -Moses nothin'. -Say, that's Jonah. -No, it's just me. I worked for the doctor, and I just... Well, come on out of there now. Ain't nobody gonna harm you. -What you doin' in there? -Nothin'. I was just- Thought you thought I was Mr... Professor, and l- Say. Say, wait a minute here, Rufe. You know, I got an idea. See what you think of this, Fleety. What do you say... You want to get your money out of this, don't ya? Sure do. What do you say you let me take this on the Claremore Queen... and Ill soon have your money back. And we can get Duke that appeal lawyer too. Well, I don't see how nobody can kick about that. -Do you go with this? -Yes, sir, I works here. I play the banjo and the mouth organ and the calliope and... -Calliope? -Yes, sir, and the... -What's your name? -Well, I was baptized... David Begat Solomon, but... -David Begat what? -David Begat Solomon. But I changed it to George Lincoln Washington. Well, now, listen. lf you're goin' with me, we're gonna... stick to the Bible. -You're Jonah. -Yes, sir. But I can't swim. Where do you want this virgin queen? Put her there by her husband. What do I know about a king and queen anyhow? All I ever did do is sell medicine up and down this river here. But Ill tell you, if we get right down to earth... and we can change these people around into people these... folks on the river wanna see... we can make a lot of money. Now, for instance, who-who's your favorite female? -Pocahontas. -Pocahontas. That's great. Now, we'll just make Pocahontas out of her, see? Get some feathers and some paint and all. Who was the feller she was with? What was his name? -Captain John Smith. -Captain John-Here- Here's Captain John Smith right here. Over here, we'll take this fella. The gentleman here is... 'King George'-One, two, three. King George III. I never heard of him. We'll make that gentleman... into George Washington. That's who it is. And this one over here... we'll take him... Hey, hey. Hey, that's Napoleon. Better leave him alone. Uh-Now, here. Here's these two New Moseses here. I think they're old prophets of some kind. But there ain't nobody interested in prophets nowadays. I tell you, we'll make outlaws out of them. -Frank and Jesse James. -That's great. That's- Everybody wants to see the James boys. Pop, I just now done told you, Topsy goes back... there with Uncle Tom. You know good and well she don't goes with Napoleon. Here's Mr. Ulysses S. Grant, Mr. Doctor. Grant? Oh, say. I just happened to think. Say, we got to go right by Vicksburg. And they ain't never forgot down there. No wonder old Professor Marvel skipped town. You know, I knew a fellow that got run out of... Vicksburg for just lookin' like him. I tell you, if you all don't want him... this uniform just about fits me. You'll have to change him to somebody else. Say, Im gonna change him. You know what Ill do? Take that old cigar out of his mouth... and we'll make him Robert E. Lee. I been waitin' here kind of hop in' you'd come. Gets mighty lonesome sometimes. I had to come. We're leaving tomorrow. Ain't no thin' nicer than... go in' up and down the river. Dr. John's got the appeal lawyer. He's gonna send you the money fast as we take it in. I sure would like to be in them river towns and see your show. Oh, it's mighty beautiful. Fella in here used to work in a tattoo parlor in... Perryville, and- Well, I kind of been get tin' some tattoo in' done myself. I wished I could see it. Well- See what it says under the heart? Its my name. Ive been learn in' to play the saw too. I wish I could hear it. I only know one tune, and... I don't know that very good. There's some thin' I gotta tell you, Fleety Belle. You know that girl that waits on table across the street? Well, l-I waved at her once. Ill bet she waved at you first. Ive gotta go. Fleety Belle, you ain't... ain't never kissed me yet. Put it over a little bit. Put it over a little. A little more there. Now just hold it steady. You don't want me to run into that sandbar, do you, Captain John? Hmm? What-Hey, hey! Look out there! Say, wait a minute there. Hey, you got to make up your mind who you're gonna... take orders from- me or you. Now, hold her right there now. Right there. You think Im learnin'? Say, you takin' to the river just like an old turtle. lf you listen to me, you'll be the best pilot on the whole river... outside of Duke and me. I sure would like to get back and see Duke. You ain't, uh, getting tired of my company already. Why, you know that ain't so. I ain't never had a dream like this. I ain't never knowed nobody like you. Why, you bought me dresses and pretty things... like I ain't never see'd before. Sometimes, when we're goin' down the river at night... I get to thinkin' about Duke... and what you done for him and me. Seems like I can hardly stand it. I feel like the Lord's just shamin' me for having hated you so. Yeah. Don't have to... worry about... The Lord's a lot broad-minded than you think he is anyhow. Put her over a little bit. Look out for this bend. That's it. Hold it steady. Steamboat round the bend! Hey, that's the river talk! Steamboat round the bend. Steamboat round the bend! Here she comes. Hey, you know what that is? That's the Pride of Paducah. Its old Captain Eli. Want to just give that old snap pin' turtle a toot here... -to show him my boat can toot louder than his. Hey, Doc! Don't forget Im gonna own that old mud scow... when I win this race! Yeah, the only time you ever gon' pass me is when... you go in' the other way. Say, what are you on that museum... the mummy? And, say, you better stay away from Salt Creek. They lynched one of them hootchy kootchy shows there last week. Where was you sittin', on the front row? I sure was! Cramp 'er, Mink! Cramp 'er! You know, Captain John... maybe he's right about Salt Creek. Oh, that old bullfrog don't know what he's talking about. Salt Creek's the last town we gonna show anything. Then we going home. See Duke. Oh! Now, look, say, don't do that. There ain't no thin' run you on the sandbar quicker... than a lot of hug gin' and kiss in'. I didn't mean to. You didn't mean to? Well, that's a fine thing to say. lf you didn't mean to, maybe Id better give it back. Too much foolishness go in' on around here. Change your clothes quick now. Put on a fancy dress. Gonna show those folks in Salt Creek some... fancy pilot in' now. Give 'em a little toot. Oh, say, there's a lot of folks com in' tonight! It looks like the biggest night we've had in a long time. Come on. Got some change? Get up in there now. Come on, Jonah. Get that started. Well, well, well, now. Well, welcome, brother. Welcome to Dr. John's Floating Museum. The show is just about to start, so get your tickets right here. There ain't gonna be no show. No? Just, uh-Just where did you, uh, get that... information, brother? 'Cause we're gonna chop up your boat, mister. -Yeah, and burn it up too! -We'll give you a trail to travel! And a bucket of tar for that gal! Come on. Let's pull this museum out of here! Mr. Efe! Mr. Efe! They're tear in' the boat down,... them gentlemen! Mr. Doc and Miss Fleety and them standing round... there, lookin' round! I never been so scared in all my life! They got pickaxes and they got ax handles... -Stand back there! -Hold up your hands! -Look out, pappy! He's got a gun! -I see him. -Im gon'shoot! -Wait a minute, boys! Don't shoot. Just hold that till I tell you. They've got the... wrong impression. -This ain't no show. -How come she ain't a show? You got a 'calli-oop.' Yeah, I know. But this is a museum. Its educational! -How come she's educational? -Well, because... because it is, that's why! Now, un cock your guns, boys, because you may... let 'em go off accidentally. Just hold it until I tell you to. Its educational. Did you ever see a petrified man? Huh? No, you never did. Well, we got one in there. Ain't we, honey? We got one in there, and he's Im gonna let you all come in there and see with your own eyes... and it ain't gonna cost you one nickel. And if everything that Ive told you about out here ain't in... there just like I told ya... then you can come out and chop it down. Now, friends, there ain't nobody that rightfully... knows just how old she is. There is people that say a whale grows an inch... every hundred years. So, well, you can figure it out for yourself. That's not a fish. This ain't a fish. That's a mammal. -Its a... -A mammal. Well, I mean it raises its young just like a cow does. Yes! And it breathes just the same as you and l. And when it gets waterlogged, it blows it out through... these breathing places in its head. Ill show you. Efe, let her breathe a little. Pappy, it breathed all over me! There you are. Now, is she educational, or ain't she? There's a powerful lot of learning in a whale. Neighbor, this thing is worth payin' for. Im glad to hear you say that. -Rex, pass the hat. -Come on, Rex. Rex, better get your pappy's hat. Yours leaks. Over this way, gentlemen, you have George Washington,... the father of his country! You can't leave without seein' Pappy! I told you on the outside that l had George Washington... here. I wasn't lyin' to ya. Friends, that certainly is a fine man! All my life Ive thought that about him and what... he's done for our country. -Will you be here tomorrow? -No, Im sorry. I won't be here tomorrow. I sure would like to have my old woman see him, if she... could get away from her plowin'. She got a picture of him, and ain't more than a week... goes by she don't look at it. Well, Im awful sorry, but we got to be in Beaver... Slough tomorrow. -They're waitin' for us. -Don't suppose you could spare... me a piece of his hair, could ya? Well, no, I don't... Me and her'd be mighty proud to have a piece of... George Washington's hair. Well, Im gonna give you a little piece here. Of course, I don't want you to have to make your wife quit plowin'. There it is. You be very careful of that. Take good care of that. Right over this way, gentlemen! Right over here! Call your attention to the stage! All right, Fleety... Belle, Efe, Jonah. Gentlemen, General Robert E. Lee. Look away, look away Look away, Dixieland Attention! I wish I was in Dixie, I say, I say Away, away A-way down South in Dixie. Away, away A-way down South in Dixie. I wish I was in the land of cotton. Old times there is not forgotten. Look away, look away Look away, Dixieland. -Come on. -Howdy there, Doc, Fleety Belle! Hello! Hello! -Hello! -Hello, Sheriff. The way this gal drag you up that hill, you'd think... she wanted to see somebody. How's Duke? Oh, fine as a frog hair. Never knowed a man... could keep so happy. Wait'll you hear him play on that saw. Man, he really whips 'er. And he eats more'n a horse. You wanna feed him good, 'cause there ain't... nothin' too good for Duke. That's the truth as I see it. Sure hate to see him get hung. What are you talking about? Why are you joking... about a thing like that? Ain't you heard? The court done turned down his appeal. -Who said so? -Doc, Im sorry. I thought you knowed. I got my orders in my pocket. I gotta take him to... Baton Rouge tomorrow night. Duke! Duke! Fleety Belle. -Duke, it ain't so, is it? -I guess it is. They can't take you, Duke. They can't! Aw, don't cry, honey. I guess things just gotta be that way. Id just about die if I never was married to you. Oh, dear, you're such a skinny little thing. You know, my Bonnie Lou got married in this dress. She was a little stouter than you are, though. Its awful pretty. Dear, I wished I had some orange blossoms. Don't seem like no weddin' without no orange blossoms. Addie May, dear, run along and fix the flowers. That's a good girl. Yes, sir, Duke, Im gonna give you a real good 'un. This makes 13 folks that Ive married what... was gonna get hung. I guess that's a record. Sheriff down in Big Bend, he claimed he done 14. But never was nobody could find where it was... put down in a book. Now, these 'uns I done. Every one of' em is wrote right here in my family Bible,... where anybody can see 'em. -Uh, everything's ready, Pop. -That's fine, Addie May. Got your flowers all put around? That's good. Doc, got the piano set. Guess we're about ready to go. Now, Addie May, can you play the 'Wedding March'? Can't play nothing but 'Listen to the Mockingbird.' I reckon that'll have to do. We gotta have some... music to get the bride in here. Run on over to the piano, dear. We'll be ready... in just a minute. -Ma! Oh, Ma! 'Bout ready? -Yeah! We're a-waitin'. Won't be but a minute. Pappy, you gotta give her away, 'cause you done it for... me when you was in here last time. Bub, let the boys in. Now, you boys quiet down and get settled now. Don't wanna have no disturbance. Gonna start the... ceremony in just a minute. Doc, the old jail looks kinda cheerful, don't it? Yeah. Go ahead, dear. Go ahead. All right, begin, Addie May. Friends... we are gathered here in the eyes of God... and one another... for the purpose of joining together... this here man and this here woman in holy matrimony. Can't nobody rightly say nothin' agin marriage... 'cause I reckon God intended... every, body to live that-a-way. Cause every, living human on this earth... has got to find his mate... sometime or other. And when God put Noah in the ark... he told him to take two of everything. 'Cause God knowed that was right... and I guess he knowed what it was to be lonesome. Now, if Duke and Fleety Belle here... had a notion... they're only carrying out the Word of God. And right here I wanna say a word about Duke. There ain't never been a finer man... in this here jail. That's the truth as I see it. Course, we're all mighty sorry, that Duke's gotta... go and get himself hung. Don't seem just-just right. But that ain't got nothin' to do with this ceremony,... I guess. Has it, Doc? All right, Duke... do you take this here woman to be your lawful wedded wife... until death do ye part? I do. And you, Fleety Belle, do you take this here man... for your lawful wedded husband... until death do ye part? I do. You got a ring, Duke? I got it. Just put it on her finger there. That looks like it might have been your mother's, son. -It was. -All right. I now pronounce you man and wife... until death do ye part. Go ahead and kiss her, son. Hurry up now, Duke. Here she comes! Yeah. Darned ol' train. It would be on time. Duke 'n' me be down in Baton Rouge before midnight. I hate to do this, Duke, but it's according to the law. I guess you done all you could, Rufe. They ain't takin' you! Go on, Duke! Get away! Ain't no sense in that. I don't wanna get you in trouble. Or you either, Uncle John. I don't wanna get you... in no trouble either, Rufe. You been mighty good to me. Oh, that's all right, Duke. I ain't holdin' no grudge. Well, guess I kinda lost my head too. I wanted to see him get away. Don't cry, honey. Rufe ain't gonna hold nothin' against ya. Don't reckon we'll be needin' these handcuffs none, Duke. All aboard! -Come on, let's get on. Go ahead, Duke. Don't you worry, honey. You know what we gonna do? You know? We gonna get on that boat and we gonna go all up... and down that river. And we're gonna hunt and hunt till we- till we find the New Moses. We'll find him somewhere. Hey, brother, you seen anything of the New Moses? Yes, sir! He was down in the swamp baptizin' about a week ago! Hello, friends! Hey, have you seen anything of the New Moses? Brother, he was here two weeks ago... and I ain't had a drop since! Uncle John, come here! Look! What is it? Huh? Oh! Say, that does look like a baptizin'. That might be him. Pull over here. Hey! Hey, brothers! Is that the New Moses? No, brother, but I am the New Elijah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! No. Its the wrong prophet. Folks out there don't look like they seen... anybody com in' through here. Hey, brothers! You seen anything of the New Moses? Brother, I ain't even seen the old Moses! Fresh thing. Hmph. -Your joke's old enough - you ought have seen the old Moses. Looks like we've missed him everywhere we've... gone, Fleety Belle. Duke ain't got much time left, Uncle John. I know that. I been racking my brain every night and day... since the thing happened. l-I don't know. I just wouldn't wanna go on... livin' if they hang that boy. I ain't goin' to neither. But they ain't gonna hang Duke. Im not sayin' we're gonna save him, but they... ain't gonna hang him. I don't know. Nobody but the Lord knows about that. Ain't got but two days left. Say, wait, I got a no-T-Take the wheel and hold it. Let me think a minute. You know what Im gonna do? Im goin' right and see the governor. -Could ya? -Yes! Well, they say he... ain't forgot us old soldiers. You know, I remember him at Shiloh. He was certainly dealin' them Yankees... a powerful lot of misery there then. Im just gonna go see him and tell him that we... can't find the New Moses... and this is not Duke's fault. Let's put her around now. We'll turn right around and take her into Baton Rouge. Oh, what's the idea of his comin' up here now? Don't he know we got a race on? Say, what's he doin'? Wavin' us in there? Go back, will ya! Go back, I say! We're gonna have a race! Hey! What's the idea wavin' us in there? We goin' on up the river! The river's been cleared for the race, Doc! Nobody can get through until they get away! Get that floatin' henhouse out of the way! Henhouse? What's he doing, calling this thing a henhouse? What are you talking about? Why don't you do as I tell you and go back? What do you mean, callin' this a henhouse? Henhouse! Can't you understand English? I said go back, not up river! I-Aww. Now, you captains ain't gonna start until... the cannons go off. Then you can do what you please. The first boat that reaches Baton Rouge wins the... race as well as the prize... from the governor's own hand. Here, Clay, hey, what's the idea of flaggin' me in here? Sorry, Doc, but you know the rules of the race. Im not in the race. Im tryin' to get to Baton Rouge. Oh, no, you ain't, either. I knowed you'd try to back out of that race. Scared you'll lose that old chicken coop. Chicken coop, nothin'. You still wanna bet the Pride of Paducah... against the Claremore Queen? As I recall, that was the terms of the bet,... unless you're crawfishing. Winner takes both boats. Is that so? Well, Ill just take you up on that. Ill bet you my boat against yours, whole hog... or none with me. Ill go in the race. Itll slow me up going to... Baton Rouge, but Ill go in. What time do we start? Sergeant Benson shoots off that cannon in five minutes. Now, wait. Give me time to load on some firewood. Im purt' near out. Same ol' Pokey-hontas. Always full of alibis. You couldn't win if you put wings on! She starts when the gun goes off. That's the rules. You fellas better hurry and get on your boats. Ill lay the course, Mink. I don't wanna start off by running over them floatin' waxworks. Get ready, Cap. Cannon's about to go 'boom!' Get ready below! Hey, come on there, Fleety Belle. Don't be standin' around. -Are we really goin' in the race? -Sure. We got to get... down the river anyhow. Ready! Hey, Doc, better hug close to shore! No tellin' when that ol' honey wagon's gonna sink. Aw, you shut up, you old... Uh, hush up. Hey, Efe! Stand by now! Full head of steam on all the time! Come on, honey. Let me get it, now. I wanna get a flyin' start. That's the boat we got... to beat, this Pride of Paducah. Hey, Uncle Jeff, throw off your spring line! We way ahead! Look here! Lemme show ya! They way back there! See 'em back there? You can see that Cherokee boat, they way back there! But that Pride of Paducah is right up there! I believe it's gon' slip by! Better get some more of that steam, if you can, in there! We out in front now, if we can just hold it. Yeah, but the Cherokee's catching up with us. Holler down to Efe! -Tell him to pour the wood to 'er. -Efe, what steam you carryin'? Im just a-wonderin', Mink, where we gonna put... that prize when we win it tomorrow. Down in the clerk's office? Uh, in the pilot's house, I should say. Well, maybe that would be best. Uncle John, look! Its the New Moses! But-Say, it is the New Moses! It is! Pull it over! Pull right over! Pull her over! Pull her over! Pull her over! Pull her over! Away! Away! Hallelujah! Glory be! Hallelujah! -Hallelujah! -Be careful! Hallelujah! Glory be! Hallelujah! -Hallelujah! -Get him on the boat, quick! -Hallelujah! -Glory, be! Hallelujah! Glory, be! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Glory be! Glory be! -Hallelujah! -Glory be! Brother, what are you doing here? -Helpin' to win a race. -Race? Gambling? -Devil's work! -Oh, no, no! This is a race to save a life. Its Duke. They're... gonna hang him in the morning. -But they can't! I seen it! -That's what I want... you to tell the governor! No, I got souls to save. No, you got a life to save, and the Lord don't care which one... of your jobs you do first. Keep a-goin', Fleety Belle! Can I get you a drink of water or somethin', Mr. Moses? Just lucky he didn't bump his head on that boat. Hallelujah! Glory, be, Brother Efe! Hallelujah! Into the fiery furnace! Into the fiery furnace! -Glory be! -Hallelujah! Glory be, brother! Come! We must have more wood! Chop up the decks here! Chop everything that burns! Every- Anything that burns! Must have more wood! Say, look here, honey. Can you get over there and get right in behind him? Sure, I can. Yeah. -In his backwash? -Uh-huh. Because if you can, the Lord has given me an idea. Here she comes! Mink, when I get sound asleep, take this here... cigar out of my mouth, will ya? Burnt up three, four steamboats that-a-way. -Mornin', Mink. -Morning, Captain. Mornin', Captain Eli! Have a good night? Holy jumpin' catfish! Fletch! Fletch! Get an ax! Get an ax and chop that old scow loose! Doc, you connivin' old scoundrel! It 'taint fair! It 'taint fair! Im just as sore 'bout it as you are, Captain Eli... when I found out we'd been pushin' you all night. Ah, son... I wouldn't keep watching that scaffold if I were you. I ain't seen it, Reverend. I was watchin' up the river. I sure thought Uncle John and Fleety Belle would be here today. Well, maybe they'll be able to get here yet. Ill stay here with you. -How much time I got? -Oh, a couple of hours. -Let me read to you a little. -Please. The fire's dyin' out, Doc. The boiler's gettin' cold. She ain't got another lick in 'er. We're sure licked now. -You got to keep the fires goin'. -Ain't got nothin' else to burn! -Well, burn that museum! -Huh? Right! Moses! Doc said burn up the museum! The mu-Good idea! You gon' burn up Mr. George Washington? Hey! I wonder how come they can... In! Mr. Moses, that's Miss Carry, 'Notion'; Lookee here-Hey! Hey, Mr. Efe! Mr. Efe! Hey! Its me, Mr. Efe! Hey! Its me! Its me! Its Jonah, Mr. Efe! Go on, brother! -Hallelujah! -Go on, brother! Glory be! Hallelujah! -Get everything in there! -Get that drinkin'... chap over there! In with the demon rum! In he goes! Here we are! Cramp her, Mink! Get in that current and cramp her sharp! Hey, Clem! Give 'er everything you've got! Spread 'er wide open and put two more men on the safety valve! Mr. Efe, there they is there! Hurry up, Uncle Jeff!. They sneakin' by! -Hallelujah! Glory be! Hallelujah! -Glory be! -Only six to do now! -Glory be! Come on, brother! Into the fiery furnace! There they come, Mr. Efe! You better make a fire up! You better make it hotter! You just takin' your time! You can't get no steam! There they go! I know good and well we... gon' have to catch 'em again! -Take 'er, Mink. -Ive got 'er. Hot ziggety! We got him beat four ways to Sunday now! Glory be! Hold 'er steady, Mink! Ain't there somethin' we can get in there and... keep 'er goin' a little further? -We're purt' near there. -We ain't got steam... enough to raise a blister. Don't seem fair. They're gonna hang Duke, and we... in spittin' distance of Baton Rouge. Nothing can save us now but the power of prayer. Hey! What are you drinkin' there? Medicine. Brother Efe, you've been deceivin' me! That's demon rum! Hey, that's Pocahontas. Its never failed us yet. -Say, we got 10 gallons, right? -Ten? We got a hundred! Then fire it up! Down with demon rum! Down with demon rum! Down with it! Down with the demon rum! Into the fiery- Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Boy, that stuff is dangerous! -Give it here! -Keep it goin'! Down with the demon rum! There we are! Into the fiery furnace! -Glory, be! -Id love to see ol'... Captain Eli's face now! Gosh almighty! Say, look, Mink! Look at the way the smoke's comin' out of'er! Hey, Clem! Clem! Feed 'er rosin! Yes, and a barrel of pitch! We'd better get hotter! I ain't gonna rest,... so we'd better catch that- Hallelujah! That must be some powerful roots and herbs... in this Pocahontas. Yea, brother! More! More! Hurl away the demons! Yes! There they are! Hurl away the demons! That's it! Mink, he's crawlin' up. We're comin' into... We're comin' into Baton Rouge! That's Baton Rouge! O God in heaven, look down upon this, thy son... Excuse me, Reverend. Say, Duke, is there any last request you'd like to make? I sure would like to see the finish of that race. Well, I ain't got no objection to that. But Rufe... told me that you- That's all right. Anything Duke wants suits me. Well, Id like to see the finish of that race myself. So, we'll let 'er go as soon as the Pride of Paducah... comes around the bend. -Thank you, sir. -It won't be long. -There she comes! Well, all right, son. Let's go. Wait a minute! That ain't the Pride of Paducah! Its the Claremore Queen! -Well, let's go. -Good-bye, Duke. O Father, Father, I beseech thee... at this moment look down upon thy son... in this, his hour of need. Grant him strength. Grant him praise... Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! I pardon this boy!
