Don't get me angry. Sit here. What are you guys doing? The house should just collapse on top of you all. It'd be such a relief for me. Just what do you think you're doing? Always with this collapsing house story. - Don't talk back. - Shut your mouth. Did you talk with your dad about the prep classes for the university exam? - Deniz? -What? - I'm watching a movie. Wait a minute. Did you talk to your dad? Look, there's only one month left. Did he make the payment? - What payment? - The payment for the prep classes. Didn't I tell you yesterday to speak to him? Speak about what? The more he gets hit on the head, the stupider he gets. Didn't I tell you yesterday to talk to him about the payment for the prep classes? - You know What happened today? - What? I went to the parking lot to see my dad. - And I saw him getting out of a car. - Oh, somethings coming. I can feel it... What did he do this time? Yeah... so...? He got out of the car.

He comes here, sits down. "Has a laugh. "Ha ha ha, he he he" Watches some TV. Then takes off saying he's gotta meet a friend. He doesn't even open his mouth. He knows I'll go crazy, that's why. And then I got to hear this from his son. What now'? He's going to use that money to pay for the car instead of classes? Yeah sure, why should he care? He knows in the end... Now look at me. This is what you're going to do. You're going to go home to your father, and tell him like this: Tell him I went crazy. And tell him he's going to save that money for your prep classes. Alright? He's not giving it for anything else. Or he'll never set foot in this house again. You hear me, Can? He'll never set foot in this house again. I'm dead serious. I'm going crazy. I can't stand this man's attitude. How can he not say a single word about any of this? Go Burak! Go and talk to him. Don't come back without having talked to him. What the hell is this? Disgusting fucker. Turn that down! Come on, what are you doing? Un-fucking-believable. - Oh... Mr. Onur is here, boss. - Good morning. - Hello. Welcome. Berk, get up from there. Onur, get a cup of tea and come here. - What did You say boss? - Come over here. Get some tea and come here. Make way for Mr. Onur. Let Mr. Onur pass Good morning. Good morning. Sorry boss, I'm a bit late, but... A bit? What time is it? Come on boss, 5 minutes. Seriously. You know what happened to me? My landlady threw all the stuff out of my house. I was just getting on my bike, leaving... I saw her throwing all my stuff out of the window. My brother took all my money. Now I got no house and no money. She threw out my shirts. Pardon me, but she even threw out my underwear. You just make this stuff up, Onur. - Boss, I swear it's totally true. - Come on, you expect me to believe this? - You really think I'm that stupid? - No boss, I swear. It's totally true. I swear. I swear. That's it. She leaned out the window. She said Take these... these are all yours! I had one... Boss, don't laugh. Come on. I had this one flower... she threw that out too. - I swear it's true. - Give me a break! - What, she threw you... - Not me, she threw my stuff out. - Look, even you're laughing as you say it. - I thought you'd understand boss. Look Onur, look. Even you're laughing as you say it. Don't do this. - Boss, I'm just trying to explain... - Don't bullshit me, Onur. - No, boss. I'm explaining why I'm late. - Just tell me straight. Because I gave the money to my brother I couldn't pay the landlord. And the woman has been nagging me about the rent for days. - I couldn't get money from anyone else. - Onur, just tell me the truth. "I got drunk last night. I couldn't get up. I acted like a fool... " Sorry... I'm late. But tell me to my face. Come on. Be a man. Did I ever get angry when you said something like that? Boss, believe me I'm telling the truth. - I swear. - Onur, two sandwiches. - Let's go! Get moving. - Alright, alright. - Do a good job, Onur. - Yes, good! The gentleman is a regular. Why? I normally do it bad? Sevki, come on. Take your hands out of your pockets for God's sake. You always take it out on me boss. Onur comes late, you take it out on me. You get mad at Berk, but you take it out on me. - Am I like your personal therapist? - Alright, Sevki, alright... - What's up, brother-in-law? - He demoralizes me. - Go Take care of customers. - Just let me deal with my boss, OK? Come on, man! How the fuck did I ever end up here? Alright kids, go out for a walk or something. For God's sake... - Always taking it out on me. - What? -I'm not good. Right in front of our, you know... Parking lot. Cars race by at like... Full speed. They don't care about kids or people on the street. The other day this guy ran over a dog. Right in front of me. The guy didn't even turn around to look. Poor thing died crying on the street. The kids there have no place to play. There are no parks around. So they come and hang out there at the lot. The other day, and by that I mean the other night... I couldn't sleep till morning, I don't know why... I don't understand a fucking thing you're saying to me. Just a second. Last night I put a bucket out there for the kids to play. They came and started throwing rocks in it, for fun. They kept doing it for two hours. I knew Ercan was going to come... "... and yell at my ass. I said "Okay kids" - Adnan! Adnan! - For God's sake just get to the point. - What point? - Adnan just get to the point! - What point?! I got fired, goddammit! I got fired. Are you happy now? Yeah! So happy! Adnan's fired again! Cut it the hell out before I kick both your asses! Behave yourselves! Look at me! Can somebody get fired for something like that? Tell me what happened. I threw a rock too. - You did What? - A rock. I threw a rock. Trying to make a basket, I threw a rock. I missed. It hit the front bumper of the car that was going fast. It scratched the paint. The driver got out of the car and started shouting. I didn't understand what was up. But he deserved it. He'd passed by like 30 times going 100 km. Then Ercan came. The guy started arguing with him. "- "What kind of people you got here?" - The man's right! - He's right. - Did I do it on purpose? If I was him I'd be angry too. I'd think he has no control over his workers. The guy is right. He runs a place where he provides security to his customers. If one of my men did something like that I'd be pissed off too. It makes sense. I've been fighting with Deniz for days. There's no peace or quiet at home. There's not enough money for the kids' prep classes. I've got to get rid of someone who's worked here for years. Now you tell me you messed up some guy's car while playing like a child. And now they want you to pay for it - What am I supposed to do? - You still don't get it, do you? - No, I get it alright. - No you didn't understand a thing. - I got it alright! -They're going to call the police. I'm going to get sued. Maybe even go to jail. - How much are we talking about? - 20 thousand. - Holy shit! - Yeah holy shit. 20 thousand. Hey boss, the guy next door is making trouble again. - What's he doing? -He says our chairs are blocking his window again. What am I supposed to do? - Do nothing. Nothing, understand? - Are we ever going to have one normal day here? -Sevki, get back to work. Adnan... Look. You know I love you. You always remind me of Gul. But, my friend, I can't worry about your problems anymore. I've got a shitload of my own problems to deal with. You've gotta solve your own problems. Can, Ercan... whatever the fuck his name is, go to him. Talk. Try to talk. Find the money. Get a deed. Get a loan. Just do something. Find another job. Work some more I can't breathe anymore. I'm finished, okay? I'm finished. Hey man. - How You doing? - Fine... Any developments? - Ercan And Ergun are here? - They're inside. Mr. Ahmet came by. His car needs to be washed. I'll take care of it. Did they tell you anything? No... Is anything wrong? - What did you do, Adnan? - I'm OK, how are you? Adnan! What did you do about the money? Yesterday after I left here I went to Can's. We talked. We took care of it. - We'll take care of it. - Take care of What? - I mean... - You'll take care of it? Hey, Ahmet's car is here... it needs an outside and inside clean, let me take care of it. Adnan, don't start with this nonsense about Ahmet's car. Are you an idiot? What are you trying to do? You want to drive me crazy? He's a regular customer, we should take good care of him. Cut the crap Adnan! Are you a child? Are you trying to drive me crazy? Is this a parking lot or a playground? You throw a rock at a man's car. You break the window. Say you're going to fix it. Then you crash it into a wall. But that's not enough, you start a fight with the guy! Are you out of your mind? Are you trying to drive me nuts? But dad, the other guy is kind of at fault, too. All we need is you now. All we need is you! What's the man's fault? Being hit by a stone? Are you insane, son? When are you going to grow up? If you add both of you together, still it's not enough to equal one real man. Son, start using your head. You wanted a business, I gave you one and you went bankrupt. You wanted a restaurant, I gave you that and you sank it too. Soto get you out of my hair, I bought this parking lot. You just park a few cars. But now with this shit. Look, son! This is your last chance. You don't get any more. Either you do this like a man or you're off to the army. Maybe you'll grow up there. I'm going nuts, I'm going crazy. Where do I even start? Son, are you a dummy? Didn't you see that man throwing stones? Tell it to him. He was the one who threw it, not me. Oh, I should be happy you guys didn't throw it together? Holy shit! The more I think the more I go crazy. I can't sleep. How could you do this? I've got to deal with this shit because of you. Adnan. Look. I'm getting pissed off. Let's talk calmly and simply. How are we going to take care of this issue? Like I said, I talked to Can. He'll help with some of it. Yeah, what about the rest? I can work here for free, until I pay it all off. Sure, why not? We're running a charity here. Listen to me. I'm going to tell you straight. Everybody will be clear. You're going to bring me that money by tonight. Get it from Can, from a friend, from family, I don't care. But I'll get that money tonight and give it to the guy in the morning. And if it doesn't come, you'll be dealing with lawyers. I'll send your ass to court. - You understand me? - I understand. - Now get going. get That money. - Let me take care of Ahmet's car first... I'll screw both you and that fucking car! Get the hell out of here! Asshole! It was your idea to bring him here. "Adnan's a good guy, smart. Adnan's hardworking. You call this smart?" What the hell do you do here? Hey man, that job you told me last week, the construction job. I'm going to take it. How can I get in touch with that guy? - You're talking about my cousin? - Yeah, you told me about it last week. We talked. They're laying people off. He's even looking for money. Come on, man... Alright, man. Thanks. The game is over. - Who was it? Ne$e or Gulden? - Ne$e, Ne$e. "I kissed him, I kissed him. Again and again. " "I kissed him, I kissed him... once more... " "- "But nobody saw me. " - Can? "- "That we kissed... " - Can? Can? - Can's not here? - No he... Adnan. What happened? - Nothing. - You're totally covered in water. - Water's coming out of your shoes. - When's Can coming? He'll come. Come in, come in. - What happened? You'll get pneumonia. - It's alright. - When is Can coming? - I don't know. We're going for a picnic. We're waiting for him. - You guys relax, pretend I'm not here. - Don't worry about it. Have some tea, warm yourself up. Sorry. - Come here, sit down. - Do You have a napkin? - What's this? - Zebra. - Zebra? - I got it from the market. Adnan, did you pass out in the sun or something? Because you're all wet. Thank God it's not winter out. Dad, what happened? You go swimming? Look: over across from the bathroom there's the shelf, go get a towel. Cut it out, son... What is this? Adnan here you go. A towel. Okay, whatever. - Alright let's go, Deniz. - We're not going anywhere. Your brother-in-law came, totally covered in water. He locked himself in the bathroom. He won't coming out. Adnan! Adnan! Will you get out here? Gunay and Hatun you know, I haven't been out of the house for 6 months... Finally we get to go out on a picnic and he screws that up too. Don't listen to this. Adnan? Are you okay, man? Come here. Deniz, you guys go. We'll join you there. - No, I don't want to go now. - Honey. Sweetheart. Go on, let's go. Cem, come on. Okay ladies, let's go. Just leave it. We'll take care of it later. The bags are ready next to the door. What happened this time, Adnan? You're not going to say anything? Look. All I've got is my Sundays. I just want to go on a nice picnic with my family and friends. Go put some dry clothes on and come. We'll talk over there. - Hey, welcome. - Hello. Hello. Come here. Come on. - So humiliating. - Let me kiss you. tell me What happened. - So embarrassing. - Come on, they don't care. - So, what happened? - What do You mean? Didn't you talk to him? He didn't say a word. I insisted, but... no. Whatever. I said I'm going, come join us. - We'll have a drink and talk about it. - No. No drinking. Remember I said this guy called me in the morning? - Swearing up And down at me. - He was Swearing at you? Oh man. I said look, slow down, what's wrong? You got the wrong number. But it was the right number. Basically, the guy's has been getting threat texts from our cell number. - What, you sent them? - What the hell would I do that for?! That girl had broken up with Burak... and now he's sending threat messages to her. Our Burak? I don't understand any of this. - Deniz, where is Berk's cell phone? - It was stolen. Oh fu... What am I supposed to tell this kid? - You're not going to tell him anything. - Say nothing? - You're not going to say anything. - The nerve of This kid. He steals Berk's phone and sends messages to this girl. - The more we interfere in this kid's life... -Today he steals Berk's phone... tomorrow he steals God know what. - Stop saying that. You're making my head hurt. Stop saying such things. - What should I say? - Something else must have happened. Don't make me yell. No, he's going to talk to him. Neither I nor you are going to get involved in this We're going to tell Adnan the situation and he's going to deal with it. There's no other way, I'm telling you. You think it'll work, Deniz? I don't know, but we still have to try. Everything else we do or say doesn't work. If talking helped... Would this have happened? Don't talk to Burak about it, just let Adnan deal with his son. Get me a new pair of sandals. I've been wearing the same thing for 5 years. Berk. Berk. You're covered in sweat. I just washed those clothes. Stop it. Berk, come here for a second. - Did You find your cell phone? - No. - Have you seen it, Burak? - Nope. - Burak! Your dad wants to talk to you. - OK. - Here - That was fast. What? You said let father and son talk, right? There you go. So you got a girlfriend, huh? What's with this girl story? What do you think you're doing Burak? Everyone's complaining now. A man... Where are you going? Burak! Blah blah blah since the morning! I told you to get this thing out of the way! Are you crazy Ayten? You think I'm talking on the phone for fun? All you do is talk. Just talk. Only talking. Don't do anything. Nothing else. - What do you mean I don't do anything? - Get That thing out of the way. - I'm the one who is doing all the work. - Are You insane? - Stop it!

I caused you all a little trouble. But it wasn't intentional, sorry. - I came because of That Water pipe. - Oh, from the municipality, fire station? No sir. Yesterday I was walking down your street... And I was kind of stressed out. You know, like anxiety. There was some water already coming out of that thing. And I kicked it. But not like a full kick... Just like a half-kick, a little... - You mean to tell me You broke the pipe? - No I didn't really kick it. - It was an accident. I came to apologize. - What do You mean it was an accident? - You broke a pipe like That by accident? - There was already Water coming out. - Police. - Okay, just... go inside. Alright.

Berk did it too. - You get out too then! - Ma'am I didn't cheat. I swear. - He's lying ma'am. - Get out! - Ma'am he's lying. - Will You get out? Come on. Move it. Get him. Get him! Take it off, take it off! What the hell is this? - Get the hell over here! - Stop it! - Burak, get off him! - Let me go, Umut! - You've ruined our life too! - Asshole! Berk where have you been? Everyone's waiting. - Where is the meeting room? - There. the second door. He may be under the sway of his friends and thus applying pressure on himself. Is it like that? Or does it go deeper? He's here. Berk. Come, sit down. In fact I want to hear Berk's side of it. What happened today? You were caught cheating on a geometry test. I didn't cheat. Nothing like that happened. - Your teacher doesn't say so. - Ma'am, she didn't really see anything. - So How did it happen? - I think They were trying to cheat. "- Who are "they"? -Burak and Umut. " - You mean our Burak? -Yes. They were sitting behind me, I didn't see them. Then our teacher told them to get out. As they were leaving... Burak said I was cheating too. But I didn't do it. Really. - I swear. - OK, so you swear. So, has Burak ever done anything like this to you before? - A ton of times. - What does That mean? He's totally erratic. Like today, after we left school... He and Umut planned this before I think. I was walking with Umut. And suddenly they pulled me down on the ground, tore off my t-shirt,... grabbed my bag and ran away. I chased them so much, dad. You know, I'm in the middle of the street... Naked. Everybody's staring at me. He also pulls my pants down in the bathroom. He does the same thing when there are girls are around, too - where is Burak? - I haven't seen him. I called Burak and his family, but they didn't come. - Do You know anything about this? - Well, other than us Burak doesn't... have any other family. I mean, he lives separately from his father. - You know his mom died 5 years ago? - Is That so? - Oh, you didn't know. - Burak is living with us the last 3 weeks. - He doesn't see his father? - He does. We didn't set a rule. He sees him when he wants. But... he's in better shape with us. At least we give him a decent family life. So... What does Adnan do at the moment? He's looking for work, but also waiting on a court decision. Court? Call it bad luck, misfortune, or Adnan's carelessness... believe me, we can't figure it out ourselves. But... At this parking lot he worked at... he damaged a guy's car. In this really bizarre way. He... oh, God... Just when it seemed OK, because he forgot the parking brake... he crashed the car into a wall. Then, later... because he was upset... He kicked a pipe and a house got flooded with water. Up to this point no one really got hurt. But... Two guys... handing out brouchers... in penguin and hippopotamus costumes... He beat them up. One of the guys pretty badly. He's in the hospital. Very funny. So, he's going to court now. So do you support him through all of this? Adnan, above all, is a reminder of my sister's memory. We give him the financial and moral support a man gives to his real siblings. Actually, there's also this... For the last five years, we've supported Adnan morally... and financially in any and every way as a family. We've given him every chance. He worked in our shop. He ruined it. He practically brought it down. He cost us a lot of money and what not. If I start explaining we'll all be in tears. But... if Burak stays with his father... You know, if you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas. And I don't want that to happen. The way it is now... I don't want Adnan either in my family or near Burak. He does more harm than good. Especially for Burak. - Yes. Who are You looking for? - I'm Adnan. Oh, Adnan. Please, come in. Sorry. I'm Faruk, the director of the school. This is our counselor Ece. - Welcome. - Thanks. Adnan, the reason we called you for a meeting today was that we had... an unpleasant incident at school. Actually you're a little late... - we already talked a bit. - I'm sorry. I couldn't make it before. It's okay. Berk gave us a different account of what happened. In fact it was Burak who cheated. But he blamed Berk, who didn't do anything. Berk told us about other problems he was having with Burak. I think that... Burak's experiencing some difficulties. And it's reasonable given that he... has lost his mother recently. - I don't get it. - Lately he hasn't been spending... - He cheated but then accused Berk, is that right? - Yes. - He said That Berk was also... - Unfortunately that's the case. - And Berk didn't cheat... That's not right, of course. It's my understanding you haven't been able to see Burak for some time now. Uh... Yes. Maybe his problems arise from this issue. I mean cheating... You all have probably cheated. I did. I mean, but... You're right but that's not the problem, Adnan. Actually that's a problem too... but we've got a bigger one here. I mean... I don't know, really. I mean... I suppose we're in agreement that Burak has some issues. That's why we wanted to make this meeting. Because we thought that we could arrive at a better... point by initiating dialogue with you. Actually... I think a little differently on this matter. If you'd allow me to just say a few words. First, I'd like to apologize to you. I feel embarrassed on behalf of our institution, this has been tiring for you. - It's okay. - Because I... If I must admit, I wasn't aware of this meeting. Ece set this meeting up. I guess I can attribute this to her pushing a little too much... and her inexperience as she started this job two months ago. - Again we want to apologize. - Actually, this is the problem... Adnan is a complete... a complete and total looser. That's the problem. Well, I'm not so sure this is the time or place to have this conversation. If it's okay with you let's end this meeting and you can evaluate... the situation later, as a family. - Let's stay in touch about... Ece, I think that'll be enough We're all really tired. Please accept our apologies and let's end the meeting now. - Nice to meet you. - You too. - Thank you. - Good bye. I'm the one who makes this an interesting place, boss. Hello, sir. Hello. Right this way... - Whoa! Sevki, that's enough! - Hello sir, hello! Ma'am! - Sevki, come on! Don't exaggerate! - We're eating and working, boss. Working and eating. What's wrong with that? - Yell, yell... - Toast, orange juice, burgers - Menemen, tost, burgers... - Burgers, orange juice, tost... They wanted two orange juices. - Burak, sit down. Burak! - Uncle, wait a second. Come on... Alright, come on. - Did You pack all your stuff up? - It should all be on my bed. I'm asking if you packed it all up, not where it is. It was all on top of my bed, uncle. Still giving me directions... Are you a complete moron? Come on. Don't lose your nerve this time of the night. Bon appetite. Adnan? Adnan? Adnan? Adnan, what did you do? Adnan, put that knife down. Actually... I wanted to buy a gun. But I couldn't find the money. Instead of a gun, you should have paid for the car. I couldn't find it anyhow. So is this the solution? I'm glad I couldn't find it I'd screw that up too. Did you drink from that glass? - They're not going to lock me up. - What? - Come on, put that knife down. - Listen to me. - What am I going to Listen to? - Listen to me! I'm listening, now. Come on. Yeah...? Nobody's ever listened to me. That's why nobody understood. Except for one... That was... Gul. She left me all alone. Good... Everything was all always good with her. What's left over now that she's gone? Look at life. Dad?
