Thank you for this proof of loyalty. But Himmler must die. He committed treason. He's no longer privvy to my plans. Mein Fhrer? Do you think I'll sit and wait until those Jewish swine slaughter me? This is part of a huge decoy manoeuvre. I've allowed the enemy... ...to invade the Reich and they think they've won. But mark my words: they have another thing coming. Dnitz is mobilising in the north. Kesselring in the south. We'll surround the enemy and crush them. From Prague, three armies will attack the Russians, simultaneously, from the back. I didn't know we still had so many reserve troops. I made sure you'll soon have a 1000 of the most modern... ...jets at your disposal. With those, you can make the Luftwaffe ready for battle again. I kneel to your genius, at the altar of the motherland. Heil, mein Fhrer. You also request to leave Berlin? Mein Fhrer, as you know, all medical departments... ...that fall under the SS and Himmler, have left Berlin. Himmler is a traitor. He won't escape punishment. Mein Fhrer, as Reichsarzt SS, I have no more work here. Your request to leave Berlin is unacceptable. My family... If the Russians... I must leave. You did nothing wrong. Future generations will thank you for you medical research. I take all the responsibility. We'll talk about it later. Gruppenfhrer Fegelein cannot be found. He's not in the bunker. What, you can't find Fegelein? Keep searching. I need to talk to him. Immediately. If he left just like that, that's desertion. Treason. Bring me Fegelein. Fegelein. Fegelein. Daddy, why are you wearing your Sunday uniform? Ernst, is something wrong? -No. Thank you. Brigitte is hungry too. Ilse, you should eat something as well. Thank you. -There you go. Thank you. What is it? -Gruppenfhrer, you're under arrest. What? -You're suspected of desertion. Get dressed. You'll come with us. Search the room. Let go of me. You can't give me orders. You can't have Hermann executed, can you? There's no doubt. He wanted to flee. What does it matter? Everything's over. Think of my poor sister. She's pregnant by Hermann. He collaborated with Himmler. He's a traitor. There's no mercy for traitors. No compassion for them. He'll be court-martialled and executed. What's the point of that? It is my wish. You're the Fhrer. Speak. The Russians are advancing more and more. There are no more reserves. Supplies from the air are impossible. There is no ammunition coming in anymore. In the north, the Russians are standing in front of the Weidendammer bridge. In the east: Lustgarten. South: Potsdammer Platz. West: Tiergarten, about 400 metres away from the chancellery. How long can you hold out? -At most, two days. Including the government area? -Yes. As a soldier, I suggest we flee Berlin. It's surrounded. The battle of Berlin killed about That's what young people are for. What you suggest is insane. Ridiculous. Think of the thousands of wounded. We can't help them. Mein Fhrer, the orders have been written. I give you my word... The Fhrer cannot make a honourless disappearance from world history. Even if an advance is successful... ...I'll end up in another troublesome situation. I'd have to stay in the open air or on a farm... ...and wait for the end. Wenck is advancing with the 12th army. He can join the 9th... ...and give the Russians the final blow. Wenck's an excellent fellow. Send a telegram to Keitel: Immediately report to me the following: You'll see, gentlemen. I'll be right. Wenck will come. Wenck will come. I want to know if Wenck can do anything at all. It's unlikely that Wenck's small amount of troops... What's unlikely about the offensive? -Wenck can't do anything anymore. Then why don't you tell the Fhrer that? Has everybody gone mad? Do you think the Fhrer doesn't know? He'll never surrender. And neither will we. I've been through that once. Never again. Come along. I have to go. Stop right there. Heil Hitler. Excuse me. I fell asleep. Did you get some rest, my child? In shorthand. My political will. More than 30 years have passed... ...since I made my contribution as a volunteer... ...during the first World War. During those 30 years, I learnt to think, act and live... ...out of love and loyalty for my people. Excuse me. The shooting. -Please sit down. Centuries will pass... ...but from the ruins of our cities and monuments... ...the hatred of the people... ...who did this to us, will continue to flare up. International Judaism and its allies. What is it, Herr Minister? Imagine this. The Fhrer wants me to leave Berlin. He ordered it. I've never ignored an order from the Fhrer. But I will ignore this order. I'll stay with the Fhrer. Please, Frau Junge... ...I want to dictate my will to you. I'm typing the Fhrer's will. Good. I understand. Some other time. Mein Fhrer, according to the racial law I'm obliged to ask you: Mein Fhrer, are you of Aryan descent? Can I see your identity card? You're talking to the Fhrer here. -Alright then. And you, Frulein Braun, are you of Aryan descent? Then there's nothing to stop us. I'm asking you now: Do you, mein Fhrer, Adolf Hitler... ...take Eva Braun, present here, as your wife? Answer 'yes'. Do you, Eva Braun, take Fhrer Adolf Hitler, present here... ...as your husband? Answer 'yes'. Then I declare you man and wife. Two men here. Everything will be alright. You must go to the Fhrer right away. -Now? How long can we hold out? -Twenty hours, no more. The Russians are close. At the moment, we forced them to stop. You know, Mohnke. The western democracies are decadent. They'll succumb to the people from the east. All the best. Thank you. It wasn't just for Germany. A message from Keitel. stuck south of Schwielowsee. the attack on Berlin. completely surrounded. What do we do when the last ammunition reserves have been exhausted? I'll never surrender. Never. I forbid you, and the other commanders, to surrender. Listen, Gnsche. My wife and I are going to commit suicide. I don't want my corpse exposed by the Russians. I don't want them to get me, dead or alive. I want to be burnt and never to be found. Gnsche, I want you to promise me... ...that you will do all that it takes. Mein Fhrer... ...this is a terrible order, but I will execute it. Kempka. -Erich, I need 200 litres of petrol. Are you mad? Where should I find them? From the parked vehicles. What's all that petrol for? -I can't say. Come, please. The Fhrer wants to see us. Should I tell the Fhrer you're indisposed? It's only my collapsed lung. I'll die soon anyway. Excuse me. Over here, Herr Professor. One moment, please. Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt your important work. Mein Fhrer, keep faith in the final victory. Lead us and we shall follow. Come along. Join the gang. Come. Have a drink. Besides drinking, there's little we can do. -Do sit down. That's better. Yes, the situation is pretty shitty. Can we sit down? -Please do, Frulein... Frau... -That's Frau Hitler. It's alright. A pity we can't go outside anymore. Only if you want to die a heroic death. Fritz, control yourself a bit. -Yes. Control. Take cover. What are you doing here? -I have to report to the Fhrer. You can't right now. Sit down. Sit. Drink. Let me introduce Frau Hitler. So young and so many decorations. You must be proud. Excuse me. I'm not used to drinking anymore. You can use our toilet. If your hand shakes, the bullet might only hit an optic nerve. That's why it's good to also take the poison. When you bite through the capsule, pull the trigger. Will I have enough time? The poison starts working after one or two seconds. Tornow, you too. Come Blondi. You know, Frau Junge, I've known... my husband for more than 15 years. But when I think about it, I know nothing about him. Even though he likes to talk. I longed for Berlin, but he's so different now. He only talks about dogs and vegetarian food now. I hate Blondi. I sometimes kick her and Adolf then wonders why she acts strange. I think he doesn't want anybody to really know him. ...he can be so caring in his private life. And then he uses that rude language again. When he's the Fhrer, you mean? Come, let's smoke another one. I'm sorry. You have so many worries and here I am, whining. Frau Junge, I'm giving you this coat as a goodbye present. I like fashionable ladies. I want you to enjoy it. What a surprise. Thank you. I just don't know where and when I can wear it. Please, try to get out of here. Promise me. Thank you. That was very good, Frulein Manziarly. The time has come. It's finished. The Fhrer wants to say goodbye. Come with me. You're the bravest mother of the Reich. Fhrer, you made me the happiest woman in Germany. Salute my beautiful Bavaria. Children, what are you doing here? We want to see aunt Eva and uncle Hitler. Have you eaten anything yet? -Only breakfast. Stay here, I'll get something to eat. I'll be right back. Comrades, this is the latest news from the outside. Berlin is full of warehouses: There were houses here, there were houses there. Herr Gnsche, I want to speak to the Fhrer. Please, I have to. Frau Goebbels, the Fhrer doesn't want to be disturbed. Please, Gnsche, just for a moment. Please. Mein Fhrer, Frau Goebbels is here. What is it? Mein Fhrer, I beg you: Leave Berlin. Don't leave us Fhrer. What will become of us? Tomorrow, I'll be cursed by millions, but that's how it is. Get up. Come. Come. Aunt Traudl, I like it when it thunders. Why? -Nothing can happen to us here. Can it? -No. Gotcha. Reichsleiter, it's over. The Fhrer is dead. There's daddy. Are you crazy? For that damned petrol of yours... Erich, shut up. Stand back. Come on, continue. Continue. No, don't. Let grandpa go. Order. Order. We must have order. Order has to return. This way. We know the way. You can trust us. Hurry. I was on the side of the Red Beasts. I supported the Bolsheviks. Let's hope the Russians got our message. We'll soon find out. -Or not. What news do you have, General? Adolf Hitler and his wife committed suicide in the bunker. The new government authorised me... ...to start peace talks... ...between our countries, that both suffered severe losses. General, if you were me, would you make peace with you? My government will never accept unconditional surrender. Given the situation, you have no other choice. Surrender? Never. That's shameful. Years ago, I conquered Berlin on the Reds... ...and I'll defend the city to my dying day. In the short time I have as Chancellor... ...I'll never sign a surrender treaty. It's for the sake of the people. -The Fhrer's orders are final. This is crazy. We have to start negotiations. I repeat, gentlemen: I do not surrender. Send a message to Marshal Zhukov. -Zhukov? What's happening? -We're surrendering. Then I must kill you. The Fhrer forbids any surrender. How long does it work? -Around four hours. Children, the doctor has the medication I told you about. It's a bit bitter, but it will work. A sip for everybody. Who wants to go first? Heide, you're always so brave? Have another sip. See? That wasn't so bad. Well done. Helmut. This medication makes sure you don't get ill in this humid bunker. But it's not humid in the bunker. Well done. Helga. I don't want to. What's that? Do you want to get sick? -Please, mama. I don't want to drink it. Don't cry, baby. That doesn't help. You have to drink the medicine. Helga. Come on, open your mouth. Goodnight, children. One day the lie will fall apart... ...and there will be light in the darkness. Please read that. One day the lie will fall apart and there will be light in the darkness. Let's do it differently. One day the lie will collapse... ...and truth will triumph once again. At that moment, we will stand above everybody... ...pure and... immaculate. We don't stand a chance. -So what? I want to get away. How do we get through the lines? Doesn't matter. I'm not staying another minute. We'll die. -It won't be that bad, surely. If we stay, the Russians will get us for sure. All the best. Come, let's go. On 30 April 1945, the Fhrer committed suicide... ...and in doing so, he deserted everybody who was loyal to him. You, German soldiers, were loyal to the Fhrer and were prepared... ...to continue the battle for Berlin, although ammunition was in short supply... ...and further resistance was pointless. I hereby declare an immediate cease-fire. Each hour you continue fighting... ...prolongs the suffering of the people of Berlin and of our wounded. In agreement with the supreme command of the Soviet troops... ...I order you to stop fighting immediately. Weidling, former commander of the Berlin defence area. A glass of water, please. I don't need you anymore. The game's over. It's time. -Don't you see what's going on here? I insist that you help us, as a doctor. Alright, then. Go. You did a lot. Thank you. Schdle, hurry. Come on. -I'm not going anywhere anymore. Come along. Are you alright? -Keep going. Sturmmann Krger and his group defended the Wolf Bridge... ...and he receives the Iron Cross. Sturmmann Wagner took out two machine-gun nests... ...and therefore, receives the Iron Cross. Sturmmann Rauch has gotten messages through the lines... ...and receives the Iron Cross. The others are coming. Take cover, Mller. Who's that? A German. Herr Hewel? Thank God, you're alive. Where are the others? I don't know, Frau Junge. Somewhere. Maybe. Most people from my group must be dead. I should never have left that bunker. I should have shot myself, but I couldn't. Eat something first. There's always enough time to die. You stay with the women. Come along. The Russians have surrounded us. -What's going to happen to us? Maybe you can get through. You could try. I'm not taking another step. Think about it. The Russians are after us. As a woman, you might have a chance. Try it. Good luck. When you walk past the Russians, don't look them in the eyes. Remember that well. All the best. The Russians. Gerda, let's go. -You go. I'm exhausted. -Please. I have to give it a try. Don't be angry with me. I'll be alright. Herr Doktor. My comrades want to surrender. Can I join you? The Fhrer's dead. Do you want to continue the war on your own? I'm obliged by my oath. Then you'd better go to the Brigadefhrer. The Russians are evacuating the square. -So? No opposition. No shooting. Then they'll be here within the hour. What shall we do? We can't surrender. -What exactly do you mean? When the Russians come, we'll empty our weapons on them. The last bullets are for ourselves. -That's radical. Is this prestigious murder and suicide our only option? We're SS officers. We can't survive the Fhrer. Who agrees with me? Come and sit down with me? -Please. Why do you want to continue living? -And you? Why do you want to die? See this? The Fhrer gave it to me personally. As a last decoration? -Maybe. A goodbye present from Hitler. I had to promise him something. If the Russians get me, I have to kill myself. Did he make you promise that? But why? Maybe he didn't want me to be forced... ...to say anything bad about him. But, as a diplomat, you're under international protection. Who will benefit if you stick to your deal? There they are. Don't shoot, comrades. We surrendered. The war is over. It's over. Complete surrender took place on 7 May 1945. Hostilities were suspended on 8 May. The war took the lives of more than 50 million people. in German concentration camps. Gerda Christian managed to escape and avoid imprisonment. She died in Dsseldorf on 14 April 1997. Dr. Schenck was released in 1953 by the Soviets. He died in Aachen on 21 December 1998. Wilhelm Mohnke was released by the Soviets in 1955. He died in Damp, near Eckernfrde, on 6 August 2001. Helmut Weidling died in captivity, in 1955. Werner Haase was arrested in the bunker, by the Red Army. He died in captivity, in 1945. Otto Gnsche was arrested by the Soviets.

Traudl Junge was classified as a 'young follower'. She worked as a secretary and lived in Munich, until her death in 2002. All the horror I heard about during the Nuremberg trial... ...the 6 million Jews, dissidents or people of another race... ...who died, shocked me deeply. But I hadn't made the connection with my own past yet. I reassured myself by thinking I wasn't personally guilty of it. And that I hadn't known about the sheer size of it. But one day, I walked past a commemorative plaque... ...for Sophie Scholl, here in the Franz-Joseph-Strasse. I saw that she was my age... ...and that she was executed in the year I joined Hitler. And only then did I realise... that youth is no excuse. And that it might have been possible to find out the truth. DOWNFALL
