It doesn't suit you. You'll age before your time. Kalonike, I'm...furious because of these women. We're not reliable like the men say. Yes. And they're right, aren't they? I told them all to come. I said it was important and no one's here. I bet they're all still in bed. They'll come. You know it's hard for a woman to get away. She's fussing over her husband or chasing up a slave or putting a baby to bed or washing or feeding it. Being a housewife... Here it comes... Being a housewife is an important job. But there are far more important things. Gunilla,telephone for you. What now? Hello, darling. Sorry to disturb you but what time will you be home? Good morning, dear Lysistrata. What's the matter? Don't frown. It doesn't suit you. You'll age before your time. Kalonike, I'm furious. I can't say you look very furious. But we have the boat and the summer house because I'm not free! Should I sell them? Yes, do that. And we'll live off what you make! No,forget it. That's better.. Go on. It's hard for a woman to get away. She's fussing over her husband or putting a baby to bed or washing or feeding it... Being a housewife is an important job. But there are far more important things. -What could that be, Lysistrata? -This is a big thing. It's up to us womenfolk to do something Can't l say "women"? -Why? -I don't like "womenfolk". It's up to us women to do something about the world. It's in a bad way. If it's up to us, it really is bad. Don't you see? If we could unite, we could change a lot in the world. We can't get involved in politics. Our duty is to look after our home and husband and children and husband... Do sound as if you're a bit interested. How long did you say this tour would last? Did you say something? See? You can do it. Those I really thought would come first just aren't here. But look... Here are some women. Lots of them. Hello! For heaven's sake, where is the wretched girl? Are we late, Lysistrata? Well, saysomething. What's to say, Myrrhine? So late for an important occasion? I couldn't find mybra in the dark. If it's important, tell us what it is! Marianne, if you learned to be ontime, you might even learn to find your place in the text. I never want to see you again! That's better.. Can't someone stop that child screaming? You're not taking him on tour, I hope! If it's important, tell us what it is. No, wait. You see... this play is very important, because it has to do with our own day and age. If it's so important, could you tell us more precisely what it's about? Well, it's rather hard to explain, it's about how things stand... now. In fact, to be more precise, it's about... women and war. I thought it was about boys and girls. -They nevertake anything seriously. -What woman ever does? Joking apart, what's it about? The play actually is a joke. A very serious one. Nothing to joke about. We're supposed to work with them? Silly things. Perhaps we'll let the viewers judge fort hemselves. Here's an excerpt from the play. - Who called this meeting? -I did. And what's it for? Yes, what's so important, Lysistrata? Good morning. Yes, what's so important, Lysistrata? Tell us. I'll tell you. But first of all... Do you mind if l ask you all one small question? Go ahead. Don't you all long for your men? For the fathers of your children? They're mobilized. I'm sure you've all got husbands away at the front. Can I help you? Mine's been away for five months. I can't tell you how sad it is. Mine's been gone for seven months. There's nota man around. If l find a way of ending the war, will you support me? Will you help me? If you're raising funds for peace, I'd pawn everything in my wardrobe. I'd fillet myself like a flat-fish and give away half for peace. Good! Here you are then... I shall tell you my plan. Fellow women! If we want to force the men to make peace, we've got to give up... Give up what? Are you ready? We're ready to die if necessary. Well... we've got to stop sleeping with them! Total abstinence is all that'll work. Why do you turn away? Where are you going? Why do you shake your head and turn pale? Do you want peace? Yes or no? Nice of you to call. Are you at home, darling? No, at the office, but I'm calling on my private line. Look, she's leaving tonight on that Lysistrata tour. Let's celebrate. How about dinner tomorrow? -When you will be here? -Come to my place for a chamge. Does she know about us? No, not the faintest suspicion. See you tomorrow then, darling. Bye! Do you want peace? Yes or no? Not me. I'll never do it. Our new perfume, madam? How do you want it? Peace or war? Yes or no? Not me. I'll never do it. Let the war go on. I'd never manage it. Let the war go on. -The nighttrain to Kiruna... -Yes, madam? When does it leave? Let the war go on. The old porter at the last place almost needed carrying instead! Of all the horrid rooms in all the horrid hotels, I have the worst! - Have you gota shower? - No. Is there a shower in this place? I believe you have a scheme for tourists to meet local families. I'm from Stockholm and I'd like to meet some nice people. Just a moment. Say it's only for foreigners. I'm almost a foreigner up here. Tell the lady that these dinners are hard to arrange this time of year.. I don't want dinner, just a chat with someone. in the afternoon... That's when children get home from school and wives cook dinner. - How about after the performance? - People go to bed early up here. Do you really exist? I can't see you. Oh, good morning! I thought I recognized your voice. How nice to have you here in Kiruna. Why not visit our home? My wife is a great admirer of yours. If what you say is true, that people won't move to make a better life, changes like that take many generations. Isn't it wrong to assume that we... - She's beginning to look old. - What's she asking all this for? Not bad on stage, though, with flattering lighting. - Don't you think so? -Yes, of course. Who says they have to be just like us? I think dinner is ready now. Shall we finish our drinks? Cheers. That was delicious. Lots left for the children, too. You have just the two? Do you intend having more? -I wonder how old she is? - What's she got to do with our life? There's no call to get so personal with strangers. When the children start school, you get more time to yourself.. Maybe it's not important to you... Oh, I quite agree. How about some coffee? Are you happy? Living so far north I mean? Oh, yes. I'm very happy here. Definately. Women! What a hopeless lot we are! No wonder tragedies are written about us. We've only one thing in our heads. Men and children! But if we do what you say... Heaven forbid... Could you really guarantee peace? I'm sure of it. Listen... -We sit at home, all enticing... - She looks younger on stage. What a load of rubbish. ... but when they want it, we refuse. They'll sign any peace treaty! - But what if they leave us? - Exactly! What then? Then we'll have to do without them. The lesser of two evils. But suppose they take us to bed by force? Hang on to the door! -And if they still force us? -Then it gets difficult. - She could be fun. -I don't get this at all. It's no fun for him when she doesn't want to. - I'm glad you enjoyed it. -We liked it very much. You got something from it? Oh, yes. Of course. Definately. It was nice of you to come. Thank you. Why does it always have to be like this? Girls, girls! Let me be the first to take the oath! No. We're going to draw lots. How do we do this? Come here, all of you. Kalonike, repeat the oath after me, word for word. -The rest of you, too. -We swear! I swear.. No man shall come near me, neither lover nor husband. No man shall come near me, neither lover nor husband. No man shall come near me, neither lover nor husband! Even if he comes like a battering-ram. Even if he comes like... like a battering-ram. No, Lysistrata, I can't say it. I go weak at the knees. Even if he comes like a battering-ram. - I will live at home as a virgin. - Marianne! I will live at home as a virgin. I will live at home as a virgin! - I will dress so enticingly... - I will dress so enticingly... I will dress so enticingly... ... that my lover lusts for me. ... that my lover lusts for me. ... that my lover lusts for me! - I never want to see you again! - I'll get a divorce. I promise. -You say it, but you never will. - I hare my wife. It's you I love. - I've heard it all before. -You'll hear it again! Stop saying it over and over again. It only upsets me. - Let's talk of fun things. - I've no sense of humor.. - But you do have my child. -That's a joke! - No one shall sleep with me. - No one shall sleep with me. No one shall sleep with me! And if he forces himself upon me... And if he forces himself upon me... I shall remain frigid. I shall remain frigid. I shall remain frigid! Perhaps a whole bedroom suite? White is very popular at the moment. Or something more exclusive in mahogany. Awider bed, perhaps. We have both 90 and 105 cm, very popular sizes. in here you can try which type of springing suits you best. Here's a cross section. The springs are very strong in the middle where the load is greatest. There are three grades of firmness: extra firm for people over 85 kilos or for those wanting a very firm springing. Along here we can select a suitable bedhead. Here we have a bedroom suite in mahogany, in colonial style. Mahogany is a very popular material. Here we have two 90 cm mattresses. But it's also available in widths of 105 or200 cm. This bed is called the "Sapphire" and is of oak, clad in raffia. I will not lift my legs to the skies. I will not lift my legs to the skies! The "Atmosphere" is our newest, available in oak or white gloss. The price is 3,975 kronor including tax. - Nor crouch on all fours. - Nor crouch on all fours! This is the "BellaVista". The price is about 1,700 kronor. Do you all swear.this? No! "Yes, we swear.." - I swear.. -We swear! -You and I have no need to talk. - Preferably not. -We understand each other anyway. - Enough to share a compartment. - Have you no shame old men? - Pensioners! - Pyromaniacs! -What are you upto? Ridiculous! A gang of women on guard! - How insulting! -What's ridiculous about it? Let me tell you, old man. You've not seen a fraction of our strength. Set fire to their skirts, men! Empty your pots over them, girls, so they cool down! I'll kick you where it hurts! Stuff it, you old bag! Darlings! I'll be home soon. Miss you. Mamma. Pluck the old hens! Kick them in the butt! Can I have these, please? You can have anything you like, darling. - I should be happy then. -And you are happy. Yes, very. Anything else you want? No. I've got everything I ever wanted. - I'm so happy. -Well, then... Here you are. Stephan, a little gentleman in corduroy. The whole suit costs 19.75 kronor. The shirt... ... is priced at 9.75. Also available in blue and red. See how well the tie matches. We have another show at 6.30 pm when you're all welcome to our children's fashion department. -Why the water, you witches? -Why the torches, old men? -You'll see the flames! -And you'll see them quenched! - Don't talk back, you cow! - I can say what I want! I'm free! - I'll heat you up! -You need awash. Get the soap! -A wash? You bitch! -You stink! Ready for you on stage. -Set their hair on fire! - Pour water on the old fools! -I'm glad you enjoyed it. - We liked it very much. You got something from it? Oh,yes. Of course. Definately. Wait! Don't go. Plaese come back and sit down for a moment. I know it's not usual for an actress to say anything apart from the play but... I was watching you tonight and thought that... If you had the chance, you'd want to talk to us about what you've seen. I mean... discuss how you perceived the play. Well, now's our chance. You can't collect your bags and shoes and hats and gloves yet. The cloakroom is closed for another I know we all want to go home, have a bite and go to bed but aren't there things more important than food and sleep? I mean, this is something that concerns us all. Is it possible to change people and the world we live in? You tell me. Can we change ourselves? That's why Aristophanes wrote this play. To get things moving, to make people care... and to make us... ...to stop us sitting around, believing we can do nothing. There are things we can do! Above all he wants us to stop thinking that we're so marvellous. You're sitting here now, completely satisfied with yourselves. What you've just seen was a trifle. A comedy nothing to take seriously. A real classic, scholarly and nice, but nothing you give athought. You sit as if you were made of wood. Say something! Don't you see? We have to talk! Stop being so embarrassed and critical. People have to be able to talk. Don't you understand that it's we who make the world what it is? What? Another revolt among the women? What happened... was it planned? Are you going on like this? -The press conference is in there. -What did you say to stop her? What? Another revolt among the women? They're always fussing, dissatisfied, wanting to change everything. They've got nothing to complain about. I think you should askher.. They're out of their minds! They yelled, poured water on us. It looked as if we'd wet ourselves. I came as a government official to collect money from the treasury and the gates are shut in my face by these crazy women. I must stop this nonsense. Fetch a crowbar! You don't have to force the gates. I'll come out voluntarily. You need sense, not a crowbar.. Where's the police? Arrest her! Touch me and there'll be one less public servant to serve the public! Scared now? Grab her, men! Tie her.up! What were you trying to say? I wanted to change things a bit. What things? I wanted to get people to talk. -Any reaction? - No. - Did you expect them to talk? - I'd hoped. Was it just to make contact with the audience or... Do you really believe in Lysistrata's method? It's one way. I don't know if it's the right one. Didn't you reach them during the play? Yes. And I thought they might talk. -The world situation worries you? -Yes. More precisely? Vietnam, South Africa or what? Is there any political involvement behind it? Of course, one cares what happens to people and about world peace. I'm not a politician, but since I'm in this play now and she'strying to do something How do you see it? What do we do? What do you ask of an audience that wants a nice evening at the theater? I hoped it wasn't just nice to have a nice time. I thought it might be nice to talk about one's reactions sometimes. Didn't you get it across in the play? Wasn't that enough? -You expected them to answer? - Whereareyou, girls? All you aunts and grannies, sisters and sweethearts! Knock them! Sock them! Kick them! Fix them! Do your worst! What do you want me to say? What do you want me to do? - Do you demonstrate otherwise, too? -Yes. Do you sign petitions? Now and then. - But why tonight? -That's not the point... Why did you react tonight? is it something personal? - Has anything special happened? - No. But of course it's personal. I'm personally involved in this. Politically involved? I want people to get on and stop fighting. Are you politically involved? Yes, but... not well informed. Don't you like the play as it is? It's wonderful. -Your part, you mean? - No, the play. But you want to change it? No, it's myself I want to chamge. That's my wife! Don't you understand? What's got into her? Get them, girls! Stop it! That's enough. Don't go too far even if it's fun. My men are defeated. Extremely embarrassing... Don't you think women like success, too? You gasbag! You're supposed to be a leader.. Why talk to idiotic women? Whatdid Liz actually do to cause all that fuss in the papers? -She began taking things seriously. -Seriously? Almost! I've never had anything against women. No, but they obviously have a lot against us! Liz really knows how to cause a commotion. - Marianne always wanted chamge. -You don't say! -Gunilla was never content. - Her, too? Do you know what I think? I don't think women ever existed! At least we've always behaved as if they didn't! -What's the matter with you? - I loved her. - Nonsense! - Didn't I? -Of course not. -Well, in that case... Gentlemen! After today's joyful ceremony we are once again free men! At some point in history... ... I needn't bother you with details... ... we put women in their place! They gave up and henceforth did as they were told. We thought that was it but we had nurtured an adder at our breast! We thought they were tamed but they started to revolt again. They started to speak and have opinions. But now, gentlemen, we've put an end to all that! What you now see are the remains, a beautiful corpse. So you are now at liberty to behave as you wish! Without their nagging and interfering. You may fight whenever and wherever you like! You may kill, betray, cheat, exploit and destroy! As much as you want! Silence! You gasbag. You're supposed to be a leader.. Why talk to idiotic women? What are you proposing to do? Take over the treasury. You? Look after the treasury? What's funny about that? I manage the housekeeping money. It's not the same thing. -What's the difference? -The money is for military purposes. That's just our point. We don't want any more wars. -Then how do we defend the city? -We'll defend you. You? That's right. Monstrous! Whether you like it or not. Ridiculous nonsense! Why get so angry? That's how it's going to be. Preposterous! We must defend you. in the corner there. Miss... Miss... There's room here. The flat-chested blonde's OK. The big one's not bad either,, If you take off her specs. Or her pants. Good evening. A table near the band? We want a quick meal. No dancing. -What a bunch. - Not up for it. Let's go. We really must do something. But what? Well, we could... We could give a performance for women only. With a debate afterwards. - Debates are boring. -What was that? - I said debates are boring. -You haveto start somewhere. -We'll organize something back home. - I won't have time. Bengt has been so good, looking after everything. I can't We wondered if you'd like to come over to our table. - For a drink. - No, thanks. -You can't just say no. -Why not? Thank you but we're fine here. Surely he'd understand If you want to do something - Didn't you hear? - Plaese leave us alone. You should be grateful you're not left alone. It won't last long now. -Would you please go away? - No social graces, you silly cows! Pretty soon no man will want-- Go to hell, you stupid fat ape, before I smash your face in so your mom won't know you! But we'refriends, Olle. Tell me honestly why you're here. Carl sent me to talk to you. Is he too busy to come himself? He didn't think you'd listen. -What do Grnges cost? - Buying Atlas... -Selling Grnges. -Selling ball-bearings. I understand you, Liz. But Carl is under pressure. His work is important and he needs your full support. Isn't my work important, then? He doesn't take my work seriously. Why should I take his seriously? Why do you have to fight all the time? Throughout that long war...... Oh, such a war...... We somehow endured. despite what you men did. We were patient. We didn'teven complain. We disliked what you were doing but had to grin and bear it. But you complained about how serious your problems were. Buying ball-bearings With a forced smile we asked, "Is peace any closer?" "What was decided at the meeting of the foreign statesmen?" And you snapped, "You don't understand such things!" "This is a serious matter. Politics is men's business." And we keptquiet. Selling LM Ericsson! Buying! You're unfair to him, Liz. You know how involved he gets in his work. - I also get involved in my work. - But, honestly, is it as important? He needs a representative wife who can see to his guests and home and is interested in his work. Selling three. Buyer: Handelsbanken. Seller: Sparbankerna... Then you'd make an even sillier decision and we'd sigh and say, "How could you permit such madness?" And with a frown you'd reply "Mind your own business or else!" -"War is men's business." -Quite right! What did you say? He thinks you want him to be a failure. We must protect you from yourselves. That's why we called a meeting of all women. We can wait no longer.. Now you have to listen to us. It's our turn to talk, yours to listen. We're going to put things right. -Selling 140 - I need 150. - I'll let you have 10. -Selling 20... - Don't you understand? -Yes, I understand I call every night: nobody's home. I call the office: engaged all day. Would he call me? Oh, no! I gota polyphoto from the doctortoday. Did you pay for it yourself? Isn't he gorgeous? Let's have a look. Some polyphoto! - How old is he? -Why? You're not handsome, but you're good. - Isn't he sweet? -Oh, goodness... How would we manage without them? I think they're a load of shit, all of them. -Aren't they sweet? -Aren't they sweet? - How to manage without them? - How to manage without them? -They're a load of shit, all of them! -A load of shit, all of them! - I must stop this nonsense. - Monstrous! - Preposterous! - Ridiculous! Stop this! We're now descending the so-called panic-stairs, one of four entrances to the shelter.. Another is an elevator forten people. The total width of the entrance is 20.2 metres. The entrances are protected by six button-operated bomb-proof doors. The weight of the doors varies between 12 and 20tons. The shelter has its own water, electricity and central heating. But, in peace-time, the public supply is used. There's also ayouth-club here, and evening and hobbyclasses. We've gota small bar and even a small theater.. Fantastic. Airconditioning is ample How will you sort this out? - That's easy. -Really? Tell me. Do you know anything about knitting? If the wool tangles, we tease it patiently loose. - We'll disentangle the war, too. -Knitting? Are you mad? - War is a serious business. - Very serious. So is knitting. It's probably just measles or something. We'll get the doctor. Everything'll be all right. You haven't the faintest idea what war means. Marianne... Marianne, come out here a moment. -What is it? - I don't know. -They're waiting for something. -We'll soon find out. -What is it? - Nothing. -Something's sure to happen. -They're just an aimless crowd. - Have you nothing better.to do? - Do you? No, but you're not much company. I'm going for a walk. Go ahead. Why so sad, Lysistrata? What's the problem? Women's nature, that's all. I despair.. But why? Because... What terrible thing has happened? We're your friends. Speak freely. Women! Put away your knitting and your ladles! Stop bringing up your sons as well-paid slaves in our welfare state. We can demonstrate! There are at least a million women in this country between 20 and 60. If we united what a gigantic demonstration that would be! It would scare our rulers stiff! What? Nothing to complain about? That mustn't stop us complaining! So you think it's all right as it is? How about our nursery care and household help? When will they be tax-deductible? How about wages for housewives? How many of you housewives get that? Plus holiday pay! Silence! It's the principles that count! They're far more important than private life. But we haven't established them yet. We've had too much to do, too many diapers to chamge. But the woman of the future will do it for us. She's not been born yet. But just you wait! This is only the beginning! Marianne! Marianne! I know what you all want: something you can never have. That's life. Isn't it just great? Let's go on torturing The more the better.. Let's seek out our unhappiness and make the most of it. Let's live as miserably as we can, so we can always blame the men. Let us nevertake responsibility, shout and scream. No one listens! Let's compromise as we always do. Let's always be sure to do our duty as mothers, as mistresses and even as wives, so we go down in history as the sex that always says, "Yes! Yes! Yes!" when we should be saying, "No! No! No!" Women... I think I'm starting to side with the men. They're right. We're ignorant, lazy, easily scared and conservative. And scatter-brained. How will we ever be capable of doing anything? What are we so scared of? We're just as responsible as the men for the world. But, if we don't act, we should at least admit why we don't. It's because we're frightened... and stupid... and dull-witted... and afraid of losing the security we're sure to lose anyway. Come down here, I want a word. But we have to do something! What? May be we can't do better. than the men but one thing they're no good at is being honest. This is our chance to act. So why don't we? -Yes, but tell us what to do. -Standing there yelling is no good! -You see? Something did happen. - It always does, if you're patient. Darling, it's great to see you. I've missed you so. And now I'm staying here until you come to your senses. I've come to fetch you. This farce has gone on long enough. You've had your bit of fun. Now it's my turn. You have your duty to me... and I can't live without you. I admit it. My job suffers. -What about my job? -Yes, dear, it may be very nice... but it's nothing to take seriously. It's got nothing to do with reality. So I can be your housekeeper? No. I have no wish for you to be a boring housewife. I want you to befun and cheerful and... understanding. I want you totake care ofme because I need you. I want you to be my representative and like having my friends home. What about your other women? What other women? You know as well as I do that I'd never look at another woman. Stop lying! You want your men! And they want you just as much! Don't give up. Stick it out a bit longer.. The oracle predicts victory for us if we do. -Who goes there? - Me. Heavens! A man! For god's sake get Myrrhine. I'll see if she wants to talk to you. Kalonike... Of course I love him but he doesn't love me. Myrrhine! What do you mean? You know I love you. -Come here, my love. - No. - But I'm calling you, Myrrhine. -You care nothing for me. I'll get a divorce, I promise. At least listen, for our son's sake. Have you no feelings? Don't you worry about him? I do, but you don't. Come and fetch him, then. It's hell being a mother.. Yes, I'm coming! Why treat me likethis? Those awful women have got to you. - Darling, come home with me. - I don't want to. only if you and the other men promise to stop the war.... If that's all you want, I'll do everything I can. If you want me back, promise. It's been so long, darling... We can't do it in front of the baby! Take the baby, someone. I can't break my oath. Don't worry, I'll take the blame. - But we need a bed. -We can lie on the ground. You mustn't lie on the ground. You might catch cold... I'll just undress first. We need a mattress. I don't want a mattress! -Of course you do. - Kiss me... Look, here's the mattress. Get up! -Oh darling, you have no pillow... - I don't want a pillow. But I do. - Have we got everything we want? - Everything but you, my love. I'll just get undressed. But promise not to cheat over the peace treaty. I promise... But darling, you have no quilt. I want you, not a damn quilt! - Up with you. - I'm already up. Would you like some perfume? - No, no. -Justa little... Hell, do I have to be disinfected? Nothing more now. Lie down and see what I've got saved up for you. Come on... I will, darling... I must undress first. And you promise to vote for peace, don'tyou? God almight, she's vanished! She's cheated me. She left me, in this state! But I must have someone. Anyone... anyone... - Is all this mine? - It's a present. You're back. Yes, I am. - I'll get a divorce. I promise. -Oh, no! Hello, darling. Hello, messenger.. is that a spear under your toga? -What did you say? -Just a line from the play. Actors are always quoting lines, confusing theater and reality. Oh, no. I know what reality is. It's being married to the most boring man in the world. Yes, I know. It can't be much fun... but what should I do? You're supposed to be interested in me, you fool. Do something! How true it is: it's impossible to live... with or without you! So I'll sign atreay, from nowand forevermore. I'll never lift a finger against you, nor you against me. Now's the time to start. Music! They're not so bad, the girls, though I prefer them at a distance. A man has a right to a life of his own. It's different for women. They'll grow up one day, too. They haven't since Aristophanes' day. So why now? Has the tour been a success? Yes, thank you. As usual, we've been out changing people's lives. How? We've made them realize how blind, stupid, selfish, idiotic, hopeless, boring and uninvolved they are... How little they get out of life. -But they're still blind. - Stupid. - Uninvolved. -Idiotic. -Boring - Unfulfilled. -Impossible. -Irresponsible. Selfish. -Hopeless. -But now at least they know it. - Did you hear what they said? - I heard nothing. Cheers! Lysistrata! An incomparable woman! This is your great moment. You must not compromise.
