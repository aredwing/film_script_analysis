Who dares to challenge him? Too bad I don't have an underwater camera. What a great shot it would be. - Yes, Alex! Will you try? - Are you nuts? Lf this cold water gets into my ears, I'll get a swollen eardrum. You get ill at a mere sight of cold water. Psychosomatic. - OK, let's move! Two by two, to the camp! - Nooo! The first one to reach the camp gets a prize. You cheated and took a shortcut. So did you, but who said we shouldn't? OK... Now, everybody get ready for a line-up! Sorry... Sorry. Hurry up, nobody's watching us. Is he for real, right over the tent like that. Move on... good, good, keep on running. Good... Where are you heading? - We're racing to the flagpole. And you are last, like always. I'm short of breath. I think I have asthma. Come on, short of breath... asthma... You're just like your mother. Get going. Attention! - Where's Grega? Grega! Grega! Grega! Grega! Grega! Oh, scout-leader Grega, so where have you been? Sorry, I didn't hear the call. - In spite of our shouts? We were knocking down the tents and screaming like psychos! I was listening to the news. - And what's new? Same old crap going on in Palestine, our team didn't make it to the finals, and global warming signals an inevitable cataclysm. I see, that's why you're so 'hot'. It's really hot in the tent. - You're not in the tent, we're lining up in the fresh air, so we're supposed to be in uniform and look? - Orderly! I'll go change... Oh, Marko Nahtigal, welcome! Where have you been? Dad gave me a lift and dropped me off at the store. I see. And what's that? Pets are not allowed here. Esmeralda isn't just a pet. She's from South America. I thought she's was a local. Anyway, she doesn't belong here. That's not fair! - Wait! OK, those in favour of the bird staying here, raise your hands! Everybody, just like I thought. - I could have brought Max. - Max? My Doberman. - OK, the bird stays. - Say thank you. Thank y'a. But if some crap happens... - We'll clean it up. You'll do a double shift on watch tonight because you knocked down the tent. - I can't. I need more sleep than other people. Are you a scout or what? Scouts sleep as circumstances require. My needs are great and they get greater every day. Here. - Dismissed. They call that food? Lt's nothing but grease. Luckily, I've brought some supplements. - It's quite tasty, actually. Why did you join the scouts, if you're so sensitive? - Dad says it'll make me stronger. He says I'm too spoiled. - Go tell him that it's either his or your mom's fault. They spoil you too much, so why put the blame on you? I'll tell him, if I make it home alive. Mom goes completely nuts if I just mention dad. Completely nuts. - How do you like it, boys? Is it too salty? - No, it's delicious. - Better than at home. Really. My grandpa would say that she's worthy of sin. A woman with curves. - Man, what I would do with her. What? What would you do with her? Nothing. - You've got one thing right for a change. 'Nothing' is the right answer. It'll take you a few more years of eating grits, before you can do anything with her. And now - action! He'll ruin my appetite with that music. You call that music? Culture... Yuk! Culture... Yuk! You're a miserable bunch with no ear for music. It was all right... Band of demons! What is this, Star wars or what? Silence! Ozbolt, stop it! He's nasty as ever this year. - Well, discipline is in order. You'd do nothing but mess around. We're scouts, man. Jake says that his dad has problems at work, and that at home he's even worse. - At home? They don't live together. Jake's mom divorced him. Don't fall asleep! We're supposed to keep watch! You're here to watch over me. I feel completely safe. Alex... Alex, it's your turn to keep watch. Wake up! Oh, man, I was flying. You're still dreaming, wake up! Is it time to get up already? - No, not for you. Lucky you, I'm keeping watch for two more hours. Keep on sleeping, Esmeralda. I have to go. "Does anyone know who they really are and where they're going? Which came first, the big bang, God, the chicken or the egg? Lt's doesn't matter, let it be! Forget about wings, let's just fly... Young or old, a bird or a mouse, just go your own way! Who knows it, knows it, and we simply know it... We fly without wings... " Look, it's only girls in that camp over there. Interesting, isn't it? - Yes. Very interesting. "You are what you are, You go where you go. Everybody take their own way, Some on foot, others lying down, and some hand in hand... " Mom forgot to pack my toothbrush. Mom? Don't you pack your own things? I do, but she wouldn't let me. She says that I forget. I'll have to get to the store and buy a new one. I need to buy some things, too. - What more could you really need? You've brought a trunk full of stuff. - Sunscreen, factor 30. Here, the chance of sunburn is even higher than at the beach. Mountains or beach, it's the same sun, you know. But here, we're closer to it and I don't want to risk developing skin cancer. - Skin protection is essential. They keep saying it on TV. - A trip to the store is a must. We're young, but we have needs, too. OK, OK... I'll talk to the camp-leader. We don't want any sunburns. - Hi. - Hi. Does she also brush her teeth? She sharpens her beak, actually. - Go sharpen your beak, girl. She's cute. Can she talk? - Surrre I can talk and you can't stop me once I starrrt. - What would she do if you let her out? - Most likely, she'd get scared and fly away. This is not her terrain. - Can I carry her? Why not? But she's pretty heavy with that cage. Get lost. Say Marko. Marrrko. - Marrrko. Flames rise from our fire, In the middle of our camp, Guarded by a mighty mountain, Sheltered neatly in the woods... Tents shine in the sun, As we proudly raise our flag... I'm too old to sing anthems. Last year, I thought it was fun. Now I think it's stupid. And you're tone deaf, too. - Who is chattering? I just explained to Alex why I can't sing. - Really? Share it with us. - My voice cracks. It's called voice mutation. "Flames are rising from our fire... " That's enough, thank you. We get the picture... Why are you lurking around with that camera instead of singing the anthem? - I'm shooting a documentary about scout life. I need to take shots of a line-up from different angles... to make it more interesting. You look great from this angle... What a profile! What's the title of this film you're making? 'The Clever Groundhog In Action'. It'll be a hit! - I see. Good. Did you hear? We'll be in his movie. Attention! After the meeting, report to your leaders and apply for skill training. For the end of our stay here we'll do some bivouacking. What's bivouacking? - Survival in nature, and in groups of three. But that's not for you, kiddo. Why not? - Because you'd crap your pants from fear, that's why! Lt's a task that only the most prepared and responsible scouts can accomplish. So... Who needs to go to the store? Did you all forget your toothbrushes? No, I need sun lotion. The first thing on their mind is shopping. How nice. Bravo! You two stay, because you were talking during the flag raising. Dismissed! Good job, scout Mohor. Don't worry, I can get you whatever you need from the store. Batteries for my flashlight. I'll be on watch more often this year. Trading cards. Xavi is the only one I'm still missing. Girls, here! A great spot! Here. Unpack your things. Just look at them. Their eyes will drop out. Like they never saw a woman in a bathing suit. Their camp is right above ours. - Yeah, scouts. Good guys. They gather wood, light fires, carve whistles and feed on wild carrots. Wake up, sleepy. Wake up! I am awake. The world is strange. If you can't change it, who will? You, grandpa. You will. No, no. I won't be around much longer. You will soon be left on your own. If you don't help yourself, no other person will help you, remember that. - But I am still a kid. Ha! Stop looking for excuses, boy! Look, you're already growing a moustache! Gosh, have I grown up that fast? Time flies, boy. Relentlessly. It's not good to waste it on sleep. Hi. I had a really sexy dream. - Tell us about it. I was lying here on the shore, alone. Suddenly, I heard some voices. I looked around and saw, that I was surrounded by girls. - Naked girls? No, not completely naked. In their swimsuits. - So? Nothing because you two idiots woke me up. End of dream. But it came true, look. - Wow, girls... Cool! Let's hope they're not contagious. Oh, baby, you're so pale... All you think about is diseases. You don't know them. Maybe they came here to treat some weird skin disease, like psoriasis. You don't know how many forms of skin diseases there are... Come on, give us a break. - My skin feels itchy already. Hey, dorks, have you never seen a woman in a swimsuit before? Boys... All they do is wrestle and make a lot of noise. They just want us to see how strong they are. Don't encourage them, girls. - What do you mean, Miss Irene? I'm sure you know what I mean, Miss Carmen. H-E-L-L-O, Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello. Hi girls, can I get you anything from the store? Cookies. - Chili chips. - Trading cards. Chocolate. - OK, you'll get it. Why don't you take rice cakes? They're much healthier than chocolate wafers. I like wafers better. - Have you tried these? No, I don't like them. - But you haven't tried them. They look weird - that colour, not to mention the shape. I'll taste one of yours, and maybe I'll buy them next time. Hi there, how are you doing? - Fine, thanks. Here, trading cards. They cost a bit more here, I guess it's because of shipping. This is for Esmeralda. I hope she likes it. Gee, thanks. She'll like it. Look what we have here, Esmeralda. Check this other package I brought for some girl... Marrko... - Say it. Here, give her an extra one, from me. I got to go. Don't tell anybody. Why do you still collect them? The championship is over. It's the champions' league. Xavi is the last one missing, he's really hard to get. If you're lucky, you could win a season ticket. Dad said he'd try to get me one, but he couldn't. He always promises. - Same here, mine promised to take me to Gardaland, and kayaking. Well, there was no Gardaland and no kayaking. My dad always complains that I am just a spoiled kid. Hi girls, I brought your supplies: Chocolate? 2.50, chili chips two packs,? 4.80... Shit, I forgot your cookies. I'm sorry. What about my trading carcds? - Here they are. Why is the pack open? I want a discount. A friend of mine is missing one, so we checked yours. He gave you one of his doubles. - You're smart. Is your family poor? No, but we all have a knack of business. Then I demand a discount. Welfare services paid for my stay here. What about Teen Scene? - Here, the latest issue,? 2.50. My grandpa is the manager of a superstore. - No kidding? Listen, your prices are really high. I have to earn something, too. For carrying the risk. Did you see that? She fainted just like that. She has some strange disease, I don't know how it's called... Lepsy-something. Gee, that must be something serious... Princesses are very delicate. They hardly eat because they're afraid to gain weight. No wonder that they faint. - An empty sack doesn't stand on its own. - One of your grandpa's sayings? Lf I don't eat soon, I'll faint, too. Let's go see if we can find some apples. - I hope they're not sprayed with pesticides, otherwise I'll start sneezing right away. Mmm, tripe stew. - Aha. I love the way you cook it. - It's hot. - I'll blow on it. It's even better than last year. And so are you. Am I? What makes you think so? You've developed some curves, nice, firm curves... What are you doing? I don't want you to stick to the surface... Mayda, we're alone... Somebody having fun spying, ha? They're not spying. They were probably just stealing apples, like they always do. - How come I don't know they steal apples? You should have told me... We're scouts and scouts don't steal! Oh dear, don't be so serious about everything. We're on vacation, remember? And it's not really stealing. We all stole fruit when we were kids. Yes, but from a tree, not from a pantry. This is a scout camp, not just a vacation. I am responsible for everything here and it's no joke! Red sneakers... Ah, I could have guessed. A fan of red sneakers and red apples - stolen apples, to be precise. We were hungry, we just took a few apples. We are growing fast. - WE... Plural. There were more of you. It was me and him, just the two of us. OK, smart guy. I've noticed that you two spend a lot of time together. You obviously like each other very much, don't you? Silence! Since you like each other's company so much, I'll let you spend the night together, too. Double watch, tonight, from midnight to 4 a. m. Why? Because scouts don't steal! Repeat! Scouts don't steal! - Again... Scouts don't steal! - That's right. Another double watch? I'll drop dead from lack of sleep. I protest. - Until 5 a. m. Then. Got it - until 4 a. m. I see you all noticed our new neighbours. It's a girls' camp, if I am not mistaken. - A sports and arts rehabilitation camp. Whatever. You can tell they're not scouts. So, why not surprise them with some scout welcome prank? Four hours - you two will have loads of time tonight, so... to kill time and avoid boredom, you'll sneak into their camp and steal their flag. - Scouts don't steal! They know nothing about scout games and pranks. We should warn them. - No, it'll be more fun if we don't. Come on, it's just a prank. - I know. Four hours! - That's torture. I wonder what the ombudsman would say, if he heard of our case. What time is it? One. Let's wait a little longer, to make sure they're all asleep. How many are missing? - A lot, but I don't care. I only collect the cute ones. It was nice today, interesting. - Yeah, as soon as there are boys around, it gets interesting. - Scouts, they're funny. Which of them did you think was really funny? I'm not telling you. - Doesn't matter, I already know. No, you don't. - I do. - I'll show you which one. - OK. Shit, what time is it? - 3 a. m. Let's go. We'd better turn off our flashlights. - OK. Where do they keep their flag? - Looks as if they don't have one. What shall we do now? - Let's take something else. Yes. Otherwise the camp leader will give us hard time again. The flag is sacred, same as the eternal flame. If the fire dies out, we go home, right? - Yes. I didn't hear you. Is that correct? - Yes! Lf there's no flag? - We don't exist. - Excellent! The Groundhog unit becomes a thing of the past. Fortunately, we've managed to retrieve the flag, but only because it was stolen by our own. It doesn't count if we steal our own flag. And without an announcement. And where is the girls' flag? - They don't have one, so we brought something else. - And what would that be? Let me think... - A pot? A pot! That's some trophy, isn't it? That's some loot, really. The king of pots! Hey, cook! We have a new pot for you! Are you happy? Are you? Magnificent loot, the pot of all pots... Good morning, neighbours. Who's in charge here? I believe that pot is ours. What kind of a joke is this? An innocent one. Just a traditional scout game, like stealing the flag. No harm meant. True. A scout's word of honour. And what does it have to do with the flag? Well, you don't have a flag, so we took your pot. I mean the boys did... We're giving it back to you. No harm meant. Here, girls, take it. We expect an apology. We apologize. Not that kind of apology. So long... Excellent! One more time! Crazy chicks, flashing their mirrors like that... They could set us on fire. - Shall we go down? - Some hero you are. What if we held a dance? - A dance? With some games. It would be our way of apologizing for having stolen their pot. No! - A bonfire, not a dance, a real scout event with a contest and a bonfire... ...to build friendship between our camps... - No! A competition comes first, then the friendship. I don't think it's a good idea to challenge a sports camp in sports, let's rather compete in knowledge or intelligence... I don't care about intelligence, I want action! Besides, they don't look much like athletes, just look at them. Let's race! He doesn't care about a dance, he already has a girlfriend. That the scout team will loose. No wonder, the girls are much, much better... Boys are poor, girls are cool, hey, hey hey! They'll blow it, they're not serious. A real catastrophe for the scouts... They really look pathetic... They have no rhythm. They're letting them win. The last meters of the race... Well, look at them. Move it, move it, boy! Faster! The girls are determined to win... against such opponents... Substitution! - What substitution? - A flying one, like in hockey. That's right, show them! Right, left, right, left... An expected and well deserved victory for the girls! Does it hurt? - No! Despite the intervention of their leader! Unbelievable, what a defeat for the scouts! And in a race that's primarily a boy's domain! Not any more, the girls won fairly. Because they were much, much better! Shame on you guys! - Yeah, if I fell like that... - That's a shame, you were swinging like a bunch of old ladies! Lt was tactics; we planned to outrun them in the finish. Some tactics! I told you to use dry branches but you just grabbed the first rotten branch you could find. It held my weight, but you're too heavy. Too much tripe stew. - I guess they like washing dishes. Well, they were better. - No, they weren't! You just had to interfere. Of course I had to. We were loosing. It was just a game. - Against girls. You can't stand any fun. Oh, really? Do you know what they used to call me at school? Joker! Because I was always making jokes! Your Jake knows about us. - So what? He can't expect of me to never get laid again. - Hey! You're a good cook. You can sew. These things really turn me on. Adolescent. If you like him, just wink at him. - I'd rather die. You know what boys are like. You have to encourage them. If he's to dumb or too shy you have to encourage him several times before he dares to make a move. - Yeah. It's all in there: 'How to spark his interest. ' I'm sweating here because of you, losers. Do some chopping yourselves! - Be quiet, Muscles, we're trying to think of a good skit. Any ideas coming from you? Muscles? That's a good name for him. OK, Muscles, suggest something. - Come on, skits are for kids! What if Cutie did a striptease? - That would be hilarious! He needs heavy make-up, girls. Don't spare the lipstick. Good job, girls! You'll be a star, I swear. - Stop shooting, please. More lip-gloss! She's fainted again. That's some kind of lepsy, nobody knows which one. It's going to rain. - Great, no need to wash the dishes. Our automatic dishwasher. Big White Butt... I like it, sounds like an Apache name. Traitor! And I like the rhymes, they could make up a nice song. Let's sing! All together now... "Oh, Big White Butt... " Come on, everybody sing! "Oh, Big White Butt, You're fat, indeed... Fat like a pig! Whoever has to carry you... " This is so funny, isn't it? "Really suffers too! 'Cause you're fat like a pig... " OK, we've had some fun, but from now on I don't want to hear that song even again! Is that clear? There... I'd really like to know which Apache wrote this crap. Jake? Who wrote it? I assumed it was you. It's written all over your face. Listen, you poet, insults will not be tolerated. I was only joking. - You'll be washing dishes every day for the rest of our stay here. Ha, ha, how funny is that? Leader Greg, what's new? Down in the south, a bomb killed 17 people, - Dismissed! Don't report such shocking news in front of the kids. They should learn what the world is like. They can't understand such things, don't you get it? I don't understand them either. How about sticking to weather forecasts? Any more showers coming? No, the pressure front is slightly dropping, but the next front won't reach us for at least a couple of days. Young ladies, you're about to witness the lighting of a miraculous bonfire - an invention of a legendary scouts' unit. We, groundhogs, are proud to carry on the tradition. This fire will last for hours without having to add any extra wood to it. It'll burn till morning. In the old scouts' tradition the most beautiful girl gets the honor to light the fire. Therefore, our main engineer of the pile will select a belle that will have the honor to light the fire. Those are juniper twigs, for special effects. Wow, like pyrotechnics. Cool. So, how about you? Any hobbies? - Nothing special, just rhythmic gymnastics. - I see. You work with ribbons, clubs and... - Hoops. That's it, yes. Do you like it? Sure, I think it's really cool. - What about you? I'm with the scouts, I play soccer, and I collect trading cards - Xavi is the only one missing. Carmen collects them, too. - It's bedtime, girls. - No, not yet... See you tomorrow at the lake. Sorry, girls. The skit will have to wait. Carmen? Carmen! Hi there, we had a great time today. Alex built a huge bonfire, and I had the honour to light it. Tomorrow, he's taking me on a boat ride in an Indian canoe. I hope Irene lets me go. And I wish mom and dad would stop fighting all the time. OK, good night now. Due to the weather forecast we've decided to reschedule the bivouacking project. You'll be leaving today... Today? We've promised the girls a ride in a canoe! Are you starting a tourist agency or what? In a few days we can expect heavy rains and storms. You don't want to get soaking wet, do you? You know what you need to pack. Don't forget your flashlights, you don't want to crap your pants out there in the darkness. Mayda will distribute DFR's, dry food rations. You have ten minutes to pack up and get ready. Dismissed. Hurry up! Move it, move it! The sun is much stronger up there, take my sun lotion. Gee, thanks. What factor... Bye, guys. Take care! Switch places... Kekec! - Kekec! Kekec! - Kekec! Kekec! What's wrong with those idiots? - It looks the weather will change, we'd better return to the camp. - No, there's no need to go back. There is - we'll give the girls a ride in a canoe instead of those dorks. - Only if I get to do the rowing. Sure, you're the strongest. Look, a waterfall. Let's go there. - Cool. You've saved my life... - Don't exaggerate. Let's go... Either they freaked out, or their fat camp leader doesn't let them go. - No, they're coming. Here we are, ladies. Shall we go? - Where's Alex? They've chosen to go bivouacking, but we didn't want to disappoint you, so here we are. Nature is screwed up. I got stung by a mosquito. I might get malaria and die. - This is Slovenia, not Africa. Here, mosquitoes don't carry malaria. At least for now. But ticks transmit borreliosis and meningitis, which is even worse. At this altitude, there are no ticks. Come on, cut the crap. - What do you know? Look, this is a good spot. Wow... Lies, deceit, cowardice. - What cowardice? You came back here running. - The storm is coming. Yes, and the best scouts freak out and run back to the camp. I don't know but... - What? We wanted to give the girls a ride in a canoe. So, you lied. - Lied? The storm did not freak you out... - No. That's deceit. - Why? Wasn't it Alex who had promised the girls a ride in a canoe? I see... Your plan was to catch the girls' attention. It was just a trick. Did it work for you? Did it? - It worked. Good. True scouts are crazy about chicks, that's a fact. But what were you thinking when you left my son out there with those two idiots? I put him in your custody, Emile, and I expected of you to look after him. They wanted to get rid of Cutie, who's been getting on their nerves. - So, you took Cutie instead of my son. Go to bed. Go to bed! Don't roll your eyes! We had a great time with the girls, didn't we? Do you think they liked us? Sure they did! We are cool and fun, we took them on a ride in our boat... - Yeah, super. Those guys up there are about to do some hard time. Great, the next thing I'll catch will be a nice cold. Some scouts we are, this damn thing is leaking everywhere. We were a bit sloppy, and now we'll get a little wet, so what? Keep quiet and try to get some sleep. But how? - With your eyes shut! There's no soup like beef soup. It's good, really good. Let's go, new adventures await us out there! Let me sleep just a little longer, then we'll go. Grandpa, where are you? Grandpa! I'll go slowly to the other side. Where are you? On the other side, in the void... I like it here! I don't know... What if it is spoiled? Are you nuts? I caught it alive. - Then it must have been sick. It'll be delicious, when it is grilled, you'll see. Provided that I manage to light this damn fire! We can always eat it raw. - Yuk. The Japanese eat raw fish all the time. Sushi. There's nothing healthier than raw fish. Have you ever seen a Japanese with any kind of allergy? I've never seen any Japanese except on TV. And some tourists downtown. I brought a cigarette lighter. Just in case... Look at Cutie. That bandana on his arm means that he's taking on a challenge, the vow of silence. Watch this! Cutie, argh! Cutie! Lf you call me Cutie just one more time... Boy, the rain was pouring like hell, and thunderbolts were crashing all around us. - How was it boys? Did you crap your pants? - You said it would be fine! Even meteorologists can go wrong sometimes. It's not an easy job. - Storms can be very dangerous. Thunderbolts... - Women always panic. Who ran back to the camp first? - The girl's right. In the mountains, thunderbolts kill on average... - Would you shut up, please? OK... - Spare us your statistics. Look over there! The boys are missing the whole afternoon. Were they injured or worse? Should I keep looking into the camera? You can keep looking at whatever you like. Has anyone seen Esmeralda? Esmeralda! Why should we go back? That camp is worse than school. Let's stay up here for a couple of days, take a look around... - Yeah, let's follow our noses. My dad will go nuts. - So what? What on earth can he do to you, to us? He's a real pain in the ass, I've had enough of him! - We'll say that we got lost. My grandpa says that freedom should be cherished. Freedom! Freedom! With Alex and his gang missing life here became a lot nicer. But they should have returned to the camp by now. By 6 p. m. Today at the latest, to be exact. Has anyone seen them? - No. But we heard them screaming yesterday. What? What were they screaming? OK, OK, we get the picture. Any other observations or comments? Esmeralda is missing, too. - Who? The parrot. That nasty bird. I knew that bird would bring nothing but trouble. But don't you think that three boys gone missing is a more serious problem than a bird gone missing? Lt probably just decided to stretch its wings a little. All living creatures deserve equal treatment. They said that there would be no more storms. What if they had been struck by a thunderbolt and their charred bodies lie somewhere out there? We'd better go find them right away. - It's too late now. My ankle hurts like hell, and you two are such jerks that you'll never find them. All you'll do is loose your way, like you did on Little Peak. No, no. We were kids when that happened. You're still kids. Get your butt off the table. They've probably lost their sense of direction. Let's wait until morning. Or, we can call 112, Mountain Rescue. Are you nuts? They'll turn this place into a crazy house, with helicopters, reporters, and everything. But what do we tell their parents if something actually did go wrong? Don't even mention the parents. As if I don't have enough of my own problems. My son is out there with those two... OK, fools tend to get away with anything, that's true. They usually are lucky. Thank God I've brought extra supplies - energy bars, vitamins, water cleaning pills, chocolate bar, tuna can, rice waffles... - You're equipped like an astronaut. - We have bows, perhaps we can shoot a rabbit if we get really hungry. They must be worried where we are. - They should be! Isn't that our parrot? Most likely, parrots are not indigenous to Slovenia. She must have escaped... We have to save her. Now we really can't go back. We'll spend the night here. Hi Jake, where are you? - Haven't I told you to put away all your electronic toys? - Jake called. - Jake? Where are they? Has anything happened, are they OK? I don't know, because you barged in and I hung up. I know you hung up. Call him! Did you just make a call? - I called Birdman. Just to let him know where we are. What if anything happened to us? I'm allergic to a lot of things, remember? Phones are off limits, especially while we're bivouacking. I took it just in case, you know. - Some scouts we are, we brought just about everything along - just in case. It's Birdman. Hello? Lt's my dad, he wants to speak to you. Why? - I don't know, ask him. What's up? - Listen, you brat, when I get my hands on you... No need to worry, Sir. We're doing fine, we're all in good shape, Jake too. When I catch you, you'll see what shape you'll be in... Hello? Hello? I can't hear you! He hung up on me. I won't listen to your threats! - Call him back. Come on, do it! And what are you doing here in a boy's tent? I'm keeping Marko company. Don't you see he's sad and depressed because Esmeralda and Alex are missing? The number is unavailable. - How come? Lt was available just a few seconds ago! The battery could be dead, there's no electricity up there. We have no electricity either, but you're all fully charged. Do you have solar cells or what? They will wash all dishes when they come back. They deserve to be punished. Silence, you greedy bunch! Keep stuffing yourselves, you'll end up fat! Silence!!! You pack of demons! She'll fall, Alex! She'll fall! Alex... Alex... Why did you wake me up? - I was bored. So wake him up! - He get nasty, you know him. Do you want an energy drink? - Oh, all right. You ruined my dream anyway. - Sorry. What did you dream about? I scored a goal at a world championship. Aha, and I woke you up just when Maya was going to give you a medal, right? Watch this now! Do you have any of that phooey left? Lt's called tofu. - To-phooey. Just one energy bar left and that's it. Crap, we're almost out of water, too. We'd better go find some. - Or, go back to the camp. What about the parrot? - Leave it to Mountain Rescue. They're experts. - You're afraid of your dad. Damn it, the little brat ripped off my binoculars! There they are! - Can you see them? No, but I see smoke. - Give it to me! Let's go get them. If we blew it by returning to the camp too soon, we can now make up for it! That's exactly what you'll do to make up! Lt's far and uphill all the way... We'll need some money for travel expenses. What travel expenses? - For a cable car to take us on top. It's easier to search going downhill. That was a good one, I give you that. Give me a hand... closer, closer... I can manage now, thanks. Good morning. - Good morning. You're still limping. Have you seen a doctor? No need, it's just a bump. It'll heal in a day or two. I don't think so. Anyway, we're having a farewell party tomorrrow, and you are all invited. You still owe us a skit, remember? Isn't it so, girls? - Yesss! - We are always up for fun! We got to get organised. You got loudspeakers? You already ripped us off... - I can give you a discount. You definitely need snacks like chips, cokes... OK, go get some. We'll collect the money. Now you're talking. Now I'm glad I took dance lessons. - Why? So that we can dance tonight. How come you're leaving so soon? We were at the sea side before, now we're going home. Do you know that those idiots still haven't returned? Maybe someone got injured. Anyway, we've located them and we're bringing them back. I'm leading the rescue. - Cool. Let's go there and ask for some food. It smells good... Wow, first time I hear you say something good about normal food. Would that be a theft, or wouldn't it? That's a philosophical question. We're hungry. - And there's nobody around. It's like stealing fruit off a tree. Cool, then it's not a crime. You're such a pig. - Don't worry, it's purely organic. I feel stuffed. I'm not going anywhere today. It's Sunday, so it's OK to take a rest. What do you have in that bottle? - Schnapps. Dad will kill me. Let me take a sip... It's disgusting. Those mountain babes were hot. What I'd give for those girls to be mine! Do you know what more is out there, waiting for us? - What? - Adventures, man. Do you know that Chihuahuas' saliva is sterile? You may like Chihuahuas, but I like... Mountain babes, a bit older and experienced. And those girls like... What do they like? - Young boys. Boy, what I would do with them! Hey, dude, your foot has totally swollen! Hey, it's all right, you've been dreaming. Nothing is all right. I need a hit of schnapps... Unbelievable, he not only snatched my binoculars, he took my schnapps, too! He's a kleptomaniac! You always take a flask along when you go hiking. Yes, just in case, you know. I'm going for a smoke. Sure, smoking really helps. Damn it! Little creep. What's up? Did you see that? He's smoking. He's nervous... because of that bear. Once a bear tastes human blood, nothing can stop it. It can come right into our camp. I'm not scared. If it comes here, I'll just lie down and play dead. Right. If a bear comes, you'll die of fright. Don't be so nervous. - I am not nervous, you are. Just imagine that some parents show up, asking how their kids are doing? 'Well, they were supposed to return yesterday, but they got lost in the woods. ' No big deal, we already sent some boys up there to rescue them. Great! Let me give you a massage. Or, if my ex showed up! She's mental! Where is Jake? I want to see my son! She totally spoiled him, that crazy broad. Your neck is so stiff. My neck is stiff because of her, but you get me stiff a different way. - Parents are here. What is it? - Someone's dad is here. Tell him to come back some other time. You can't just send him away. Hello. - Hello. How can I help you? I came to see my son. - And your son's name is? Alex. - Alex! Lt's Alex's dad... Alex, let me think where Alex is... Alex! He's not here. He's on a trip. - Right. Alex is not here... He went on a... on a trip... with scout-leader Peter. - I don't mind waiting... No, don't even think about waiting. Esmeralda! I wanted to surprise him, I didn't tell him I was coming. So... I guess I'd better be going. Now, now, now! Oh, can I ask you to give him something? Lt's the last one missing in his set. Xavi, wicked! Barca, Barca! - The ball... Have you seen a doctor? - No! Yes! Here all injuries are checked by a physician, even if it's just a bump. - It doesn't look like a bump. Bye! - Bye! We just started out and you're already getting tanked. I need to release the pressure in my ears, because of altitude. Brandy helps, because it raises blood pressure. Where are you going, boys? - A few scouts went missing and we have to bring them back. - Oh, some action, great! Those are real men, see? While you barely keep your eyes open. Ten squats, now! - Come on, leave him alone. We, Fekonjas, were always mountain folk. Fekonja! Sausage. - Bravo, Mayda. We need this for strength. - How come you're not eating? I'm not hungry. I don't feel like eating. John doesn't feel like eating? Are you sick? I feel kind of dizzy. A little. - From the height? No. I think I'm in love. Damn Mother Nature! I itch all over. You miss your folks, that's all. - Psychosomatic. You're right. Where the hell are we going, anyway? He's on the verge of a nervous break. Maybe we should head back? I don't know... What about the parrot? We said that we would head up Little Peak. It's a hawk! Damn! Go away! Do you put a cross on an animal's grave? I don't know, I guess not. I could make a speech. I made a cross, just in case. - You're nuts. For the parrot! We are gathered here in the wilderness to burry our beloved parrot, who was captured and stolen from her family, then sold as a house pet across the ocean. What are they doing? They buried something... Life is cruel, and all good things must soon come to en end. Esmeralda, rest in peace. Now they're leaving. Just you wait, you buch of idiots. You can't shoot a hawk with a homemade bow and arrows. Yeah, too bad. Ha, we got you! - What now? Back to the camp, now! - Who do you think you are, my mother? The troop-leader sent me after you! - And if I say no, then what? I can kick your butt. - You can kick my butt... Well, I'd love to see that. - Oh, yeah? - I can hardly wait. I'm still waiting for you to kick my butt. Just leave me alone, will you? - OK. You're on your own now, but I would like to know how these two dorks will carry you all the way to the camp. The girls are having a dance tonight. - What dance? Are you brain-dead? "Oh, Big White Butt You're fat indeed, Fat Like a pig... Whoever has to carry you, Really suffers too!" How come you're singing, too? - To forget about the pain. I didn't know that a bird of prey could devour a parrot. They must be hard to chew. Maybe Aborigines eat parrots. They're kind of weird. Why are we making a detour? Lt's the long way... Bastards, you're carrying me past the girls' camp. Look: I took your babe canoeing, and she said she would dance with me! They're coming, and they're carrying someone on a stretcher! Thank God! What were you thinking? Why didn't you come back? Just as long as nobody's hurt! What's wrong with your leg? Lt's nothing, just a bump. I bet it was your idea, you Apache! Pack of demons! Where were you? Didn't I tell to return to the camp the next day? Go to bed, all of you. Immediately! Lt's five p. m. Calm down, everything ended well, don't take everything so seriously. I take everything seriously? No way, I am just joking for the mere fun of it, ha, ha! And you two, you two will keep watch all night for the rest of the week! And what shall we be doing during the day? - Washing dishes! There's a whole pile of it waiting for you, smart ass! Come here, son. It's OK, they tricked you into this... Go hug your cook, and leave me alone. They didn't trick me into anything, I'm just as guilty as they are. I'm not such a kid. If they have to wash the dishes, then I'll wash them too! I've had enough of you, get it? Real nice, how pathetic. All for one, and one for all. So be it, you'll regret it! From now on: No more store, no more swimming, and yes, about the dance tonight - consider it cancelled! You need to calm down. Go smoke a cigarette, if it helps you. Smoke two, if you have to. There's no ambulance! Take a bus? There's no bus service! So, take a taxi. I don't have that much money! What country we live in! - That's not fair. Martin should bring the best stuff, snacks, balloons. Like that. - And condoms, just in case. We haven't got any money left. - Right, but he doesn't know that. All he wants is make a profit. Marko, we have some bad news. I thought so. Go on, tell me. Your parrot is dead. A hawk killed her. We shot arrows at the hawk to scare it away, but it was too late. But Esmeralda was very brave, she fought back. She was still alive when we got there... She just lay there, but raised her head slightly and said with her last ounce of strength: Marrrko! Marrrko...

Your dad left this for you... Xavi? I'm sorry that I was in such a bad mood before. I'm sorry that I was in such a bad mood before. No problem, really. You're a good sport, let's shake hands. You're a good sport, too, most of the time. Hey, what did you mean by 'most of the time'? Oh, a whistle. - It's hand crafted. - Thanks, Muscles. You're stuffing yourselves and you haven't paid! I don't get sleepy, I fall asleep without a warning. It's not dangerous, but I'll never be able to drive a car. What's it called again? - Narcolepsy. Narcolepsy, I have it, too. I am sure I do. - Come on, Sleepyhead. Europe faces devastating changes, almost the entire continent will be in the arctic belt, with floods in the south, a major catastrophe... - Jake! But such problems could have been avoided easily, like malaria in Africa, and yet it kills thousands of children there every year because of our ignorance... I'll visit you. - You promise? Scout's honor. "Does anyone know who they really are and where they're going? Which came first, the Big Bang, God the chicken or the egg? It doesn't matter, let it be! Forget about wings, let's just fly... To your own cloud, To your own castle... Young or old, a bird or a mouse, It doesn't matter, Just go your own way! Who knows it, knows it, And we simply know it... We fly without wings To our own castle... We fly in our dreams... " This is going to be a great movie! GOING OUR WAY
