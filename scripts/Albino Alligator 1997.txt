Very funny. They say it's not the heat but the humidity that fucks you up. BOBBY (OVER RADIO): Wouldn't be so bad if I could find my lighter. You guys have it? Your lighter, Bobby? No, I ain't seen your light... You seen his lighter? Oh, did you lose something again? (LIGHTER CLICKS) MAN 2 (OVER RADIO): This is Browning. Listen, Johnson, if you idiots don't keep this channel clear I'm personally gonna come out there and light you both on fire. (CAT HOWLS) BROWNING (OVER RADIO): What they doing? MAN 1 : Well, looks like he's still waiting. (SONG) MAN 1 (OVER SPEAKER): Yes? MAN 2 (OVER SPEAKER): Oyeme. It's gonna be 4 a.m. closing time. You bring what you got, we'll bring what we've got. MAN 1 (OVER SPEAKER): No. No, I bring nothing until I see what you got. You show me first. (ALARM RINGS, DOGS BARKING) Shit! Goddamn it! What the fuck was that? Let's just slow down. We're in a stolen car. What? Could you say that again? You see, I'm having a hard time hearing you because the alarm blew out my fucking eardrums. I don't wanna risk going to jaiI for nothing. Well, jail is exactly what I'm trying to avoid. You know, Milo, I'm still disenchanted with you, so why don't you shut the fuck up and let me make the decisions. All right, all right. You wanna hang yourself, go ahead. I got some more rope back here if you need it. COWENS: This is Cowens. Suspect is on the move. BOBBY (OVER RADIO): Copy that. ATF. Keep me advised. COWENS: Going to his car. Holy shit. I think he saw me. What the fuck? Where's he going? What the fuck? What the fuck? Where'd he go? What's going on? He's not getting in his car. Oh, goddamn it. What the fuck? Where did he go? Oh, shit. Oh, fuck, man! Okay, okay, okay. Wait a minute. He's leaving, but it looks like he's changed cars. He's in a different car. He's in a Lincoln. He's in a Lincoln. No, no, it's a Buick. Goddamn it. Check that. It's a Buick. What the fuck is it? A Buick or a Lincoln? I don't know what the hell it is, man. It's some kind of big old gas guzzler. You'll see it when we get down there. We're on our way down, all right? (TYRES SCREECHING) BOBBY (OVER RADIO): I got him. He's coming right at me. COWENS (OVER RADIO): We're on our way, Bobby. You still got him, Johnson? He's going straight? (CHUCKLES) BOBBY: If it ain't my lucky day. COWENS (OVER RADIO): Bobby, come in. You there? MILO: Well, I didn't know there'd be guards either. DOVA: You're the alarm guy. I leave that shit up to you. (THUDDING) Christ, what was that? Ground. We hit the ground. No, no, not that. Something else. COWENS (OVER RADIO): Bobby, which way did he go? Bobby, are you over there? Come in, Johnson. I guess he found his smok es. Oh, God! Oh, Jesus! There he goes! There he goes! There he goes! Move! This is SpeciaI Agent Cowens. We need backup. I got an agent down on the corner of LaMonde and Main. Send a medic ASAP. I'm in vehicle pursuit of suspect. Over. BROWNING (OVER RADIO): All right. This is Browning. We're on the way. You're on LaMonde? MILO: Oh, now, wait a minute. Wait? Wait what? You ready for this? If you mean hearing things he's gotta say, then no. No, I ain't ready to hear shit from him. Jesus, I didn't know you could say that many words in a row. Does that smart mouth bite too? I bet you it don't. All right. I bet you it don't. Oh, there's someone coming up on us. DOVA: He's moving. I think it's a cop. No, I don't see no flashing lights. (SIREN SOUNDS) Shit. COWENS: We just made a left on Carelli. He's not slowing down. Rear ram? (TYRES SCREECH) (SONG) Down here. Let's go down here. What's down there? Fuck if I know. A place to hide. We're... We're closed, sonny. Yeah, uh, my friend, he had a little accident. He tripped and fell and bumped his head. He needs to use your bathroom, if it's okay. Your friend needs an ambulance. Hey. Hey, put your hands where I can see them! Now! Hey! Hey, you! Get up! Get up! Put down that cue! Okay, lock it! Get up on the table. Hey, shitface, sit down. Sit down! Now, you listen up. Here's the news. Nobody moves, nobody says anything, nobody's gonna get hurt. We're only gonna be here for a couple of minutes. You just relax. Drink your beer. Drink it. Enjoy your evening. That's easy for you to say. You don't have a gun pointed at your head. Hey. I said everybody be quiet. Especially you. Where's your bathroom? Over there, where it's always been. Come here. Take him to the bathroom. Try to clean him up. Now, when they get out of the bathroom, we're gonna leave you booze hounds to your drunken lives. For now, you just sit tight. (DISTANT SIRENS SOUNDING) What do I owe you for this? It's free. Just take it. Last drink's always on the house. No, look, I wanna pay for it. How much? Two bucks. Two bucks? For a lousy beer? You gonna pay for it or not? Big-time gangster like you ought to be able to cough up a deuce. Did I do something to you in another fucking life? (MUMBLES) Keep the change. Oh, you are a big spender. I like that in a man. You know, I just don't know what it's gonna take to make you shut up. If you don't bite, then don't bark, doggy dog. Hey! Shut up! BARTENDER: Look, we don't want no trouble. You don't want no trouble, huh? Then everybody keep fucking quiet. Look at the boy. He's been good. He hasn't said " boo" on his own. He must have gone to Catholic schooI, like me. Did you go to Catholic school? I went to Catholic school. I was an altar boy. (WHISTLES) (COUGHS) DOVA: Hurry up! Mr. CooI, huh? Mr. Quiet? Let me tell you something, Mr. Quiet. You being quiet tells me that you're smart. And smart people sometimes fuck things up by trying to be clever. Now, I hope that you're not smart and clever... because then we've got a problem. (HUMS) Now you're gonna rob me? The day just keeps getting sweeter. Rob you? Kind of. But you don't have a car? I don't drive. You don't drive? How do you get to work every day? I take the streetcar. Sir! I got a car. It's a green Chevy station wagon. It's parked right outside. Outside? Station wagon, huh? Chicks must flock to you in a car like that. Hey, you can take my car. BMW. Smooth and fast. Parked just up the block. I think I'll take the beemer. Sorry, kid. (PHONE RINGS) Whoa! Just put the phone up on the bar. Hello? No, this ain't Dino. Yeah, sure. (WHISPERS) Who's Dino? That would be me. It's my place. Yeah. He's... He's busy right now. Okay, Dino. Your wife or your girlfriend or whatever the fuck you wanna call her wants to know if you still need a ride home. Don't you fuck with me! Can't blame a guy for trying. Yeah, I just talked to Dino, and, uh, he said he doesn't need a ride home. He'll be leaving any minute. Oh, me? I'm just a friend. Uh-huh. It was nice talking to you too. Bye. She seems like a really nice lady. Does she know you're a no-good, Iying sack of shit? Sure does. Back up. (PHONE RINGS) Shit. Yeah? Put him down! Help me! Get me a stooI. Keep an eye on them. Holy shit. Check that door. What's back here? What's through here? Fuck! Where's the back way? DINO: There ain't no back way. Ain't no windows either. No windows? You're in a basement, dear. DINO: Built during prohibition. No other exit. Ain't that illegaI? It is if you don't grease the police. Well, your fucking friends are outside. Unplug that line. We gotta barricade this door. BROWNING: Marv! Yes, sir? Where's the report on this man? It's being faxed over, sir. Also, I want a sound team in the warehouse above the bar, sharpshooters on the buildings west and south and blueprints for all the buildings in the area. And get these goddamn cars towed out of here. Right. You got them? It's just ringing. What do you mean, it's just ringing? Where's my megaphone? In the trunk. Do you want it now? No, tomorrow! Yes, now, goddamn it! DOVA: Get down from there. Don't you wanna talk to them? Not yet. I mean, fuck! What's going on here, huh? We've only been in here five minutes. Seems like a month of Sundays to me. What now? Give me that! Wait a minute! You wanna know what? I'll tell you what. Get out of here. " Miss Janet Boudreaux, Female, born February 6, 1956." My ass. " Five-foot-seven, 120 pounds." (LAUGHS) Yeah. Organ donor. Let me tell you something, Miss Donor-Bitch. Now, you don't know me, right? But now I know you, right? Like where you live. You keep your mouth shut, or you're gonna be "doning" a lot sooner than you thought. As a matter of fact, come out from behind that bar and sit on that stooI where I can see you. Come here! Just forget her, okay? (WHISPERING) I want you to keep an eye on these people. Hey, look, I'm trusting you with this, okay? (SONG) Browning here. No, sir, we haven't been able to make contact with him yet. Yes, we're sure he's there. There was a blood trail that led from the accident all the way to this bar. Yes, the two men are dead, as well as Agent Johnson. It looks like he just ran him down with his car. No, no way he could have survived. No, I won't make a move untiI you get here. It's a really nice shirt. Man. You should have got married when you had the chance. Had kids. Settled down. Got a job. Who are you kidding? Come here. J ANET: Can I go to the bathroom? Not now. Okay, give me the gun. Here, give it to me. Okay, I'm gonna send those pigs out there a little message. I'm gonna get you some paper? What? You're gonna write to them, right? DOVA: No, I'm not gonna write to them. I'm gonna fire off a round, showing them that I'm serious. That I don't give a fuck about nothing. And we don't mind playing hardball. That ain't hardball. Hardball would be killing one of the things in here. (WHISPERS) Hang on a second. We ain't gonna kill nobody. It's a trick. That's pussy league. No, no, no, it's a ploy. And that's the plan, okay? Suppose they storm in? No, no, they're not gonna storm in. Look, these guys have got procedures, okay? Hey, they're not independent of thought and action, like us. They got a book, and they gotta follow it, right down to the last letter. Come on. We're the... We're the ones who refuse to conform to the dictates of the group. And we got them right where we want them. (CLEARS THROAT) MARV: " Extensive investigation began about three weeks ago when a message was intercepted saying that the suspect would be travelling to New Orleans in two weeks with $65,000 suspected for the use of buying guns." The Montreal police have been contacted, but nothing has come through yet, although the one guy that I did talk to in the Montreal office said that this guy was never known to be violent. All I see is feet, boss. That's all you gotta see. You watching? Yep. I can't believe there's no back exit in this layout. (GUN COCKS) Shit! (YELLS) Dino! Put down your fucking gun! Don't be stupid. Nobody walks into my fucking bar and pulls this shit! Put it down, or I'm gonna fucking redecorate my bar with your friend's brain. No. No, no, come on! Put it down! No! Now! (GASPS) Ain't...such...a...fucking... tough...guy...now! MAN 1 : We don't know for sure anyone died. MAN 2: I've just been told to sit and wait. MAN 1 : Who told you? MAN 2: Michaels. And do you know what he really wanted to know? He wanted to know if the media had arrived. Can you believe that? (SONG) Uh, excuse me. You... Your friend, uh... He's... He's awake. (GROANS) Milo. Hey. Hey. What's going on? Are you okay? LAW: He's okay. Where are we? Milo, you want a smoke? In some basement bar. Can you move? Take one out. Take one out. Put it in my mouth. Put it in my mouth. You're something else. Anything broken? I don't know, man. Everything. God... (COUGHS) Damn! MenthoI. I hate menthoI. I know. The ape shows restraint. I'd go toe to toe, but since you're so much smaller... Hey, enough already! What are you doing provoking him? We got other problems here. Jeez, I'm already bleeding here. Well, don't bleed some more. All right! Maybe after your nose is better. Law, would you just keep an eye on these people? Better yet, frisk them. Oh, no. You are not gonna touch me. DOVA: Hey, leave her alone. She doesn't have anything. She sure does, boss. DOVA: No, she doesn't. Check the boy. Man. We gotta talk. Tell me. (SMACKING) Don't cut yourself with it. (TSKING) Oh, don't you worry about that. I know how to use it. I'm good with my hands. Hey, come here. Come here. Give me the knife. Don't waste your time fucking with this guy. He's nothing. If you blow on him, he'll fall down. Come on. Give me the knife. Don't fuck with that guy. Here, you keep it. Where was I? Sit over there. Over there. Have you talked to the cops yet? Fuck, no. I unplugged the phone. Look, we... We gotta... We gotta stall them or something. So they don't come busting in here before we can figure out what we're gonna do and how we're gonna get out of here. We need to... We need to bluff them or something. I ain't talking to them. MILO: Can't let him talk to them. Why don't you let one of us talk to them for you. DOVA: Who the fuck are you? Guy. My name is Guy. (PHONE DIALLING, RINGING) Sir, may I ask a question? No. Sir, are we sure that that's him in there? I mean, we don't really know for sure, now, do we? We sure as hell do. The car that was described over the radio during the pursuit was exact. The route that was travelled was the same too. The bloody mess they found on the grille sure seemed to look a lot like Johnson's head. I got them back on the line. You got them? Give me that. Say again? No, no, no, no, wait...! Slow down. Just say it again. " I am a hostage and am in great danger. If you ever wanna see me or any of the others alive, you must comply with our demands. First.: Remove all police personnel from the street in front of the bar. If this is not done in one hour, one of these people will die. That is all." And guess what. She ain't kidding, you know. Prison ought to suit you just fine. Goddamn that sick...! Making a hostage send that message. What about the demand? It's such a stupid request. He knows we ain't gonna leave. He's just buying time. Hey, you too, altar boy, with the rest of them. Come on up here. We can talk more private up here. Hey, you wanna make us some coffee? Do I look like your bitch? Come on, man. Just make it. I never made coffee before. My mom always makes it. Your mom? What, does she come over and make it for you every day? No, not every day. Every fucking other day. You got a problem with that? Me? No. Fuck it, man. I'll make it. MILO: No, we gotta talk. Alone. DOVA: What...? What about Mr. Quiet? MILO: You can see him from here. I'll make it. Good. You make it, kid. I like mine black. J ANET: I'm sorry again, but, uh... What? May I go to the bathroom? When was the last time you let these people go to the bathroom? What am I, the bathroom attendant? Hey, you think we could listen to some Johnny Paycheck? DOVA: No. The woman is suffering. Just let her go to the bathroom. DOVA: Now, look, no more music, no more questions and no more fucking interruptions. All right, hurry up and get your ass in the bathroom. And put, uh... Put, uh... Put Dino in the storage space. You ready now? More than ready. You said there's no back exits, right? Yeah, we checked it out, man. There's nothing. Well, no, there's gotta be another way out of here if this was a speakeasy. Drinking was illegal then, you know, so the cops would raid these kind of places. Everybody's gotta get out of here fast. And they can't go through the front, because the cops are coming in that way, so they gotta go out the back. What, through a wall? Look around at this place. This is... This guy treated this bar like his baby. He does his best to preserve it the way it was, you see? He doesn't change a thing in here. I still don't see no exit. You don't hear what I'm saying. They're hidden. So what do we do? Some fucking voodoo dance? Rub a fucking lamp, and the shit just opens? MILO: Maybe. They don't exactly blueprint this kind of stuff. It could be anywhere. We just gotta check it out. We can't exactly ask the bartender. She might know. Hey! You feeI better? Better? Yeah, you know... Never mind. Look, you work here, right? Yeah? Yeah. Did, uh, Dino ever say anything to you about a hidden exit? No. Never heard of one. And you say you work here? Yeah, worked here for 10 years. But just because I work here don't mean... Hey, lip is what I don't need. I asked you a simple question. Look... I happen to know that this used to be a speakeasy. So you... You think hard. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait. Now... You're sure that you don't remember him saying anything about, uh, another way out of here? Think I'm hiding something from you? I mean, I'm... Hiding? We never said anything about hiding nothing. Yeah, but that's what you're thinking... Hey, shut up and answer me! Hey! I know what you're looking for. Dino showed me one night. Just leave her alone. How far does this thing go? I don't know. I didn't fucking dig it. Ow! (GLASS TINKLING) Just go sit down. You don't have to do that now. I wouldn't have to do anything if y'all hadn't come in here tonight. We're gonna be gone soon. Don't worry. That big one with the gun is crazy. Crazy and a gun tends to make me worry. He's not gonna do nothing. What about you? You got a gun too. So? But you're not gonna use it. Are you? I don't wanna talk anymore, all right? And that other one... He seemed like he got a good heart in there somewhere. I know he's boxed in. He's... He's scared. Men do stupid things when they get scared. Look, why don't you just keep your opinions to yourself. Okay? Sure, sure. You're just... You're smarter than he is. You don't wanna be a part of this, do you? Look, please, mister, don't you think you could get him to let us go before he gets us all killed? I mean, he's... He's in over his head. He's.. He's acting like a... He's acting like an idiot. Hey, shut up. I don't care how smart you think I am. You're talking about my brother. Just go... Just go sit down, all right? I meant no disrespect. DOVA: Oh, fuck. JaiI ain't an option, you know. Yeah, I know. You'd better be fucking serious about that. What, do you think? You think I'm fucking...? No, no, no, no. I don't think Milo's got it in him. Well, listen, don't you worry about Milo. Milo's thinking right now. He's thinking of a way to get us out. I'm thinking. I'm thinking all the time. And I'm thinking I ain't going back to jaiI, no matter what, okay? So those people out there, I say fuck them if we have to. You with me on that? Because I don't think he is. Look, when push comes to shove, I'll fucking shove. Now, you know me. Listen to me! I will not let anything happen to him. Do you understand me? I'll do whatever it takes to convince him, but I will never hurt him. (HELICOPTERS WHIRRING, SIRENS APPROACHING) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (SONG) Go! DANNY: Well? LAW: Bricked up 60, 70 feet back. He's, uh, bleeding again. Then take him some fucking napkins. It's okay about the tunneI. Don't worry about it. What time we got? It's a little before 6. All right, kid, scram. We gotta talk. It's okay. Go on. Thanks for the napkins. DOVA: All right, look, their hour's almost up. Uh, excuse me, but before you guys start your meeting, can I please go to the, uh...? The...? DOVA: Huh? Oh, yeah. Go ahead. Keep an eye on him, will you? LAW: Uh-huh. BROWNING: How much time? MARV: About five minutes. I want that call made not one second after the deadline. What's up with the back door? There isn't one. What? The blueprints show the building was built in the '20s. Believe it or not, there are no other exits. What? They didn't believe in fucking fire codes in this city? It figures. And the rest of the surveillance? Nothing. Still deaf, dumb and blind. Well, let's go make that call, hear what he wants. DOVA: I can't tell, but it looks clear. Good. (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) Whoa! Shit! They're pulling something. MILO: Well, what'd you expect? They were just gonna leave? DOVA: This was a good-faith request. What's gonna happen when we really start making demands? (PHONE RINGING) Think we should let them get away with this? Let's show them who's boss here. They think we're fucking clowning around. I say we whack one of these people for real, man. No more bullshitting. Right fucking now! Wait a minute! Jesus Christ. Don't listen to him. He's a fucking sociopath. What good would that do? You'd still have to get out of here. Folks, shut up. Hey! Show the lady a little respect. Uh-oh, big man. Look, everybody, shut up! Now, you gotta listen to me, brother. This is no time for some bullshit macho crap. Do you know what city we're in? Those cops out there are serious. We're the ones that are gonna die in this bar. Unless we think before we act. And what have you thought of? A fucking voodoo escape hatch? We need a plan. You need a plan to escape. Talk, talk, talk. That's all I'm hearing. I mean... Fuck. You... You... You have to get out now. No more waiting. He thinks so too. What? Were you talking to this guy? I didn't say jack shit to him, but he's right. And I guess you're all geniuses, huh? And I guess that makes me the idiot. Well, fine. Then why don't you all figure this shit out. Because all I seem to be doing is fucking everything up. Calm down. Just take it easy. You gotta listen. Okay. Plan. I'm listening. Tell them you will let go the hostage one by one. Then, instead of releasing us... release yourself. (SONG) Yeah. We, uh... pretend we're the hostages. Then, uh, tie us up. And, uh, you'll be gone before they come in. What do you think? Hey, I'm a "social-path." You know what I think. MILO: We gotta mak e some demands. Then, each time that they give us something, we give them a hostage. Nobody gets hurt. And then, when they're waiting for the finaI demand, then we get the hell out of here. (COUGHS) Yeah. Where? MILO: I don't know. Mexico. There's something missing. I say we take the kid. What? It'd be like an insurance policy. Do you think these people are gonna talk if we got the kid? I don't think so. I wanna go. You see? He wants to go. Yeah, if it'll make things easier... No. Look, I'll go. LAW: I like that. Yeah. No way. The kid goes, and that's it. Look, if anybody is gonna go, it ought to be me. You've been nothing but a fucking headache since we walked in here. So sit down. But if we take the kid, I bet we could trust all these people, right? Okay, we've got your point. You fucking better. What? No, I won't say a thing about the kid. I'll be too busy describing your face to the police sketch artist. Nothing had better go wrong, because I just don't know what I'd do if it did. No, no, nobody want no coffee. Uh, bring me some water over here, would you? Oh, my God. Here they come. Who? Goddamn it! MARV: I'm surprised it took them so long. BROWNING: Well, they're here, so we'd better deaI with them. Oh, check that. You deaI with them. What do you want me to tell them? BROWNING: Tell them shit. Tell them nothing. Say " no comment" a lot. I don't care. Uh, no. Uh... Ah, let me talk to them. I know what to say. (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) What the fuck? You're not ready yet? Come on! Come on! Jesus Christ! Come on, hurry the fuck up. I'd like to get this shot before the sun comes up. Fuck! Jeez! (MUTTERING) Excuse me. You in charge here? Yes, ma'am. Hi. I'm Jenny Ferguson, ChanneI 7 Action News. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind just answering a few questions on camera for the morning report. No, not at all. Great. Excuse me. That would be great. (CLEARS THROAT) Okay, you ready? I'm sorry, what was your name? Browning. G.D. Browning, ATF. Browning. Okay, excellent. Okay, we ready? Okay. (CLEARS THROAT) Hello, this is Jenny Ferguson. I'm standing out here on Townsend Street near the south docks. It appears that an unknown gunman, or gunmen, has taken some people hostage in a local bar. Now, there has been reports of gunshots. Apparently, it all began after 4 this morning and has continued until now. Standing with me here now is Agent Browning of the ATF. Agent Browning, can you shed some light on what's been happening here? Well, it looks like some goddamn stupid motherfucker has decided to take some poor innocent fucks hostage. Now, we've been out here all fucking night trying to deaI with this goddamn situation, but there hasn't been a fucking break yet. But we're sure as shit hopefuI that everyone will be safe and that we bring this motherfucker, or motherfuckers, as the case may be, to fucking justice. How's that? What are you doing? You hit the seven. Right here. I can't make that. What do you mean? He's got the three. No, no, no, the three is stymied. No, it's not. Milo, please, it's blocked! You can't see it from there. It's completely blocked. You gotta go with the seven. It's your only shot. Bank it right here. No, no, no, you gotta hit it bottom right. Here. All right, line it up. Take your time. Get down. Like that. Got it? Uh-huh. Good shot. DOVA: Yeah, well, don't listen to him. It was a good shot. It was your only shot. It would have gone in, except this, uh... This cue is a little... No, yeah, that was a tough one. Yeah, I'd say there are tougher things in life, kid. Yeah, I guess. It's your shot. I ain't got nothing. Albo-gator it. What? Albo-gator. Albo what? You've never heard of an albino alligator? MILO: No. What the fuck is that? Down here, we've got gators, right? But every once in a while, one of them little things is born white. An albino. He's weak. And useless. Except for one thing. Sacrifice. The other gators will use him to gain new territory. See, what they do is, they send him out in the open, just waiting to get him killed. Because when some rival group of gators shows themselves in the open killing the albo gator, they surround and kill their rivals. No more albo gator. But no more rivaI gators neither. And new territory is definitely gained. Deliberate sacrifice... for a deliberate gain. It's a weird fucking story, you know that? Just park that white ball in front of his pocket so he don't have a shot either. Albo-gator him. MILO: Isn't it almost time? What time we got? LAW: 6:15. There. It's albo-gatored. Hey, Miss Secretary. Hurry up! It's almost show time. Hurry up! Putting on your make-up? This ain't TV, you know, it's radio. Come on. Could I talk to you for a moment? We got deadlines. I know. I know. Just take a second, okay? Please. All right, hurry up. Make it quick. I'd like to apologise for the things I said when you first come in here. Eh. All right. It's about the kid. Yeah? What about the kid? Well, you know, just let me tell you about him. Okay? I mean, he comes in here a lot, you know, plays a lot of pool. I ain't never seen him win. There's this one guy, right, a regular, you know, plays him all the time. He's a hustler, okay? I mean, everybody knows he's a hustler except the kid. The kid thinks, you know, it's luck. Guy's made a lot of money off him. Lady, this means nothing to me. Now, just wait a second, now. I'm not finished yet. You know how Dino said he paid off the cops? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Well, I don't know if that's true, but, uh, we had cops in and out of here all the time. You know? I mean, they know Dino. They know me. Yeah. If I go out there with you... and I tell them you're my friend, then you are my friend, okay? I mean, they'll believe me. Hmm? How does that sound? I'm still listening. If you take the kid out there... They don't know the kid, you know? I mean, they're gonna question both of you separately. Kid's family is gonna be there. Hard enough to lie to the police, let alone your own family. I mean, the kid will crack. I know what's at stake here. I won't crack. Well, you haven't cracked yet. Right. I mean, that's what I mean. I mean, you can't take a kid out there. You need someone who knows the score. Someone who's more mature. (CLEARS THROAT) Well, I'll think about it. Okay. Thanks, Bill. I'm standing out here on Townsend Street... (TV MUTED) Turn up the volume. What? The volume on the TV. Turn it up. LAW: I saw that clicker. I can't figure it out, boss. I'll get it. Well, all I can say is that we're inv olved in a hostage situation here that will inv olve our commitment to being here in an investigation, joint investigation, with the New Orleans Police Department. Okay, can you confirm for me how many people are being held hostage inside at this time? At this time, I cannot. Can you confirm the rumoured deaths? I'm sorry, I can't comment on that now. JENNY (ON TV): Well, we've heard that at least two, and possibly three, agents have been either injured or killed. MARV (ON TV): Like I said, no comment. Um... All I can say is that we're inv olved in a hostage situation, and we're doing everything we can to mak e sure that everyone comes out safe and sound. JENNY (ON TV): Thank you, Agent Rose, for your time. So, to sum up, there is a gunman, or gunmen, holding an unknown number of hostages in Dino's Last Chance Bar. Details are sk etchy right now, but we do have an unconfirmed report that at least two officers have been killed in the line of duty. Reporting live from Dino's Last Chance Bar, this is Jenny Ferguson for Channel 7 Action News. Okay, turn it down. JENNY (ON TV): Back to you in the studio. Kid, from now on, you're in charge of the TV set. When the news comes on, I want you to turn up the volume. Got it? Can I get my coat? I'm cold. DOVA: Yeah, all right, kid. Three dead cops? Look, they're gonna call here any minute. Are you ready with the note? Sure, yeah. How about you, kid? You ready? I thought you said that... Yeah, I know, I did. I'm taking him, all right? So just... Shh! Enough! Enough! You read the notes. He comes with me. But I know them. Do you understand? No more. No more! Hey, kid, you're doing the right thing. You know that, right? How'd you get in here, anyway? I knew Dino. What's your name? Danny. All right, Danny. You go over there and sit with the rest of them. No, that's... That's great. But even if it's probably right, there's no way to confirm that. I don't think we should run that. I mean, going out on a limb like that. I don't know. You know what? Fuck it. Run it. No, run it. Run it. You guys, I'm telling you. This is a great story. You should run it. Because if it's wrong, we'll retract it, all right? (PHONE RINGS) Make sure she reads this word for word. Now read this. " Here are the demands. There will be no negotiation. First, an empty bus with all the windows painted black must be driven onto the sidewalk directly in front of the bar. Once in place, the driver must exit, and no one else will be on it. The bus must have a full tank of gas. Second, a small jet must be waiting at the airport. It has to have enough fuel to traveI 3000 miles. Third, there must be no tricks. If any of these amends... Demands are not met exactly as they are presented, a hostage will die. For each demand that is met, one hostage will be released." Very good. LAW: I wanna talk to you guys. Come over here. (WHISPERS) Hey. (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) (SONG) We ain't gonna really kill anybody, right? No. No way. Say it. Say what? We ain't gonna do it. Yeah. We won't. You swear on Mom's grave? On Mom's grave. We ain't gonna really kill these people. Yeah. Right. Now you. What? I wanna hear you say those exact words. We won't. Swear it. I don't like swearing on my mother. Come on. Just say it. Come on. Do it. I swear on my mother we ain't gonna whack no one. Unless we have to. MARV: Well, the plane is definitely a no-go. BROWNING: Fuck the plane. He ain't even gonna reach it. MARV: You and the Chief agree on that one. He doesn't want him up in the air either. By the way, he has some other ideas too. Oh, he does, does he? Well, that's nice. He's gonna sit back there in Washington in his comfy chair and tell us to sit tight and wait and comply with all the demands. Well, fuck that. I'll tell you this: One more fucking gunshot goes off, and we're going in. Game over. Good guys win. I'm gonna naiI him before he gets on the bus. MAN 2 (OVER SPEAKER): You bring what you got, we'll bring what we've got. MAN 1 (OVER SPEAKER): No. No, I bring nothing until I see... You show me first. COWENS: Holy shit. I think he saw me. AGENT 2: What the fuck? (PHONE RINGS) Let it ring. We said what we're gonna say. Hey, turn it up. Now, the siege has been going on for just over two hours now, and there seem to be no breaks in the case. All I do know is that some demands have been made by the gunmen, but no report has been made to us about what those might be. Now, as I reported earlier, we do have an exclusive but unconfirmed report of the identity of the man who is holding these hostages. His name is Guy Foucard. A Canadian citizen, he's a wanted known gunrunner... What the fuck? What the...?! What? That... That's me. Guy Foucard, huh? I don't know what... Suspected gun dealer? My name is not "Guy." My name is "Ghee." I am not the man they say they want. Your picture's up on the fucking screen. Yes. "Ghee," "Guy," who the fuck are you? The photo is me. The photo is me. But, I mean, fuck... (STAMMERS) Maybe he's a cop trying to trick us or something. I am not a cop. No, no, no, that's not it. He's not a cop. He was in here long before this whole thing went down. Right. It's something else. What? No, nothing. I mean... I knew something was wrong. I never liked your idea. If he is a cop, I say we waste him right now. Right fucking now! He's not a cop. You searched him. He's got no gun. Right. He's a liar. Trying to set us up. Trying to frame us. All right, listen to me. Listen. Okay. You're gonna tell us who you are Yes. and what you're doing here and why you won't... Shut up! And why you're wanted by the feds, or my friend here's gonna start breaking your fingers. Understand? GUY: Okay. Fuck. DOVA: Yeah, you like that? Why can't you talk to them? Hey, shut up. Now, you listen... Shut up! Shut up! Okay. Yes. I have... You gonna tell us the truth? They know me. Shut up. And you're gonna tell us the truth. And if your story doesn't jibe, he's gonna keep breaking your fucking fingers untiI it does. You got me? Okay, but these people... Oh, fuck it. No, wait, wait, wait. They know... Milo, stay out of this, man. Go sit down. I don't wanna talk to you. I want him to start talking. Yes, okay, okay. I mean, I'm telling you, I don't... This... I am not... I am Guy Foucard, yes. But, I mean, I'm here for business. I work for the government of Quebec. In the morning, I go to Mexico City for some meeting, and... I had some free time before the plane, so I come to this bar. And these... I know these... They know me. I come here. I... Fuck. I mean, there's a movie, an old movie was on TV, and, too bad for me, I stayed to watch it late. Was this guy in here watching TV? Well- He's not a regular, so I didn't pay much attention, but maybe... (SNAPPING, GUY SCREAMS) What did you do that for? Because he's a fucking animaI. Fuck you, Milo. The TV was on mute the whole time. He couldn't have been watching, or at least he wasn't that interested. He's lying. Wait, wait, wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're right, you're right. Listen, don't do that till I tell you to. What did you say that for, man? What? What? Watching TV. The fucking thing wasn't even on. I... I don't... Fuck. Is this...? Probably I was watching... I don't know. I remember that... Speak fucking English! I... I think that... The fucking... The movie was over when you guys come in here, and I... I... There was sport news. I think it was the... Sport news? Sport news? You mean...? I think so. Are there sports shows on that late? Yeah, there's one on channeI 9. Right. I think that's the one. But he wasn't there that long. He came in a few minutes before you. He's a fucking drunk, this guy. (SPEAKS IN FRENCH) (SNAPPING, GUY SCREAMING) Fuck! That's enough, goddamn it! Milo, stay the fuck out of this. Some things you're good at. This ain't one of them. Okay, okay! I... The police... The police are looking for me. I... Is that what you want? I mean... Fuck. Throw me out there. I'd prefer that to be with you fucking guys. Listen to me! It doesn't matter what he says. If that's the guy they say they want, then that's the guy they want. Who gives a shit? It doesn't change the plan. (SCREAMS) Let him go. Hey, let him go! Ah! Wait! Wait! Why are you doing this? Come on, let's go. Come on. DOVA: Let's go. LAW: Get in there. Get the fuck in there! GUY: You have to listen to me! Please! I can help you. We gotta stick with the original plan. You gotta go to the hospitaI. They're not gonna let you just walk out of here. They're gonna take you straight to the emergency room.. for God knows how long. Long enough to get us busted. GUY: I am innocent! You have to listen to me. Will you shut him up? GUY: Okay, I... Ah! Please, man, give me the fucking key, man. A gift. A solution to our problem. No, man. What the hell are you talking about? They got evidence. What evidence? They... They got the car. The car was stolen. We'll say that... this guy, he stole the car, he got in an accident, he came down here, he killed the fucking bartender. If we wanted, we could smash his face in and make it look like he was in an accident. What about these people, man? Don't you...? You think they're gonna just forget about what really happened in here? Don't you think that's a problem? What do you want me to do? Just give up? Well, fuck that. Man, I see another way out of this. No. No, man. The only way out is for us to pretend that we're hostages. I got a bad feeling about that plan. We gotta do something else, man, or we're gonna get nailed. It's not gonna be long before they put two and two together and figure out what went wrong. We gotta walk out of this thing scot-free. Forget the airport, forget jaiI, forget fucking Mexico. We gotta walk out of here free men. You see? Milo, you should go to the hospital without being afraid of getting nailed. You should go to the hospital a hero. Yeah. A fucking hero. Johnny-fucking-Paycheck wouldn't run to Mexico. We ain't Johnny Paycheck. We got witnesses who will talk. Albo-gator them. What did you say? A sacrifice for our gain. I don't want to say it... but that's what I was thinking too. Best kind of outlaw is a free outlaw. (SONG) Where did you get that information from? And why did you show that picture on the air? You know how dangerous that is? I'll call you back. If you don't tell me where you got that information from, I'm personally gonna run your sweet ass from the scene. You can't do that. You want to test me, honey? Marv, run this fucking channel 7 news... Okay. All right. I got it from MontreaI. From a source in the Department up there. I know everything: his name, his MO, everything. You know we won't confirm this. You just did. Give me the gun. Huh? Why? Just give me the gun. Where you going? Where you going? You ain't gonna do it. Give me a fucking break. No! Goddamn it! You swore, man, on our mother, that you weren't gonna kill anybody. Yeah, well, things have changed. They don't want us, they want him. I'm not gonna let this happen, man. Milo, give me the gun. No. Milo, give me back the fucking gun. No. No. Give me the fucking gun! We got things to do. Are you with us or not? Go fuck yourself. Hey! Enough! We don't have time to deaI with this fucking shit. Now, you promised me you'd see this through to the end, no matter what your brother said. (PHONE RINGS) Yes, sir. Yes, sir. (PHONE RINGS) Yeah. Right now? Okay. They're going in in 15 minutes. Come on. All right, it's happening. Yeah. LAW: Where the fuck is he off to? Where are you going? I don't want any part of this. I'm turning myself in. Don't make me fucking do it. I'm gonna get us out of this. (BELL RINGING) Get the fuck out. Come on, let's go. Get the fuck out! Move, move! (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) You're a fucking liar! You know that? Quiet! You're gonna kill us, aren't you? Don't, please! Don't, please! No! DOVA: What? No... LAW: Boss? Boss. What? What? Why'd you do this? Why? I wasn't gonna shoot you. Why? Why? Come on. Come on. I'm gonna get you out of this. Come on. Come on. Did you think I was gonna shoot you? I was gonna get us out of this. All you had to do was shut your fucking eyes. Come on. Come on. You can't do this. Oh, God. Please! Please make him stop. You can't do this. Listen to your brother. He was right. You can't do this. You can't be a part of all this... This murder. Shut up! Hail Mary, full of grace... Stop fucking praying. - the Lord is with thee. Stop it! Blessed art thou among women and... Stop it. Mom! - blessed is the fruit of the... Stop. What did you say? He's my boy. My boy. Danny and me won't say nothing. We won't say nothing. You know, about what's happened here tonight. Jack, he said he would talk, but we didn't and we won't. We won't. We won't say anything. Right, Danny? Right. Right. Please. Your brother... Your brother said this was wrong, and he couldn't do it. I swear. I swear. You wanna live? Yes. That's not good enough. No? Why isn't it enough? Please. You gotta mean it. You two wanna live... then you do it. Do it. Oh, my God. (GUN FIRES) There has just been a gunshot down at Dino's Last Chance Bar. Okay, this is it. Go in now. (SONG) JENNY: - Lots of gunfire. It looks to me as if some people are coming out now. People are coming out. Back to the studio. I'll get back to you, Bill. What happened inside? (COUGHING) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) MALE REPORTER 1 : Are you happy with the way the ATF handled...? FEMALE REPORTER: What about the boy? What happened to the boy? How does it feeI to be a hero? What? I asked you how it feels to be a hero. He's not a hero. I'm sorry. What do you mean by that? I think what he means is... that none of us are. (REPORTERS CHATTERING) MALE REPORTER 2: So happy to see that you're alive and well. We still do not have an officiaI death toll, but there are three survivors. She may say that none of them are heroes, but a lot of us out here feel differently. The three survivors, of the seven hostages taken, uh, they're all heroes to get out of this situation alive and well. No one but them knows what that was like. (SONG)
