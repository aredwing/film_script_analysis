I'm totally clean, all right? He looks bad. We should get him to a doctor. - You're supposed to sell it, not smoke it. - Yeah, but... But what? You supposed to be here? I was supposed to find him. You found him. Get your little butt back on the street oryou're in the pit! Take this fuck to Madison House. He's dead. He's got an address, proof of being disabled, and there's record of his birth at the hospital. He needs the birth certificate. He doesn't have six dollars to buy it. That's not my problem. Don't be an asshole. Just call and verify. I'm sorry, I can't. - If you don't, I'll approve it myself. - You try it. Watch this. - I don't believe you did that. - Believe it. All right, Mr simms, we are outta here. - I'm reporting you to Donaldson. - His extensiors 352. - How'd it go, scott? - I don't know, Ed. For once I would love to solve a problem without this goddamn paperwork. You'd better get on it. There's a review coming up. Tell somebody who gives a shit. That kind of attitude will catapult you right to the top. I gotta get out of here. Look, I'm gonna do some field work, all right? I'll coverforyou like I usually do. - There you go. - Thanks. - Beat it! - Hold it, man! - Help! Help! - Hold it! - Got it! - Let go! Help! He's got my briefcase! Hey! That's it! Come on, give it up! Give me the case, man. Come on. (Black man) Come on, man. - (# Blaring hip-hop) - Hey, Pedro. How you doing? - (Knock at door) - (TV) 'Don and Barbara, you've won the stereo, 'the furniture and $2,000 in cash... ' - Hi! - Hi, Rachel. - scott, how you doing? - How are you? - We missed you. - I missed you. What are you working on? Puzzle. Mom, scott's here! - so. - Hi. - Finally, you come to see us. - It hasn't been that long. - It's been long. - How's your leg? You brought food. You could get fired forthat. she always says that. What's this? somebody's had a pretty good summerthis year? It's nothing. Tommy bought Mom a new dress for her birthday. Oh, yeah? Did he buy herthe TV, too? - It's nice, huh? - Where'd he find that kind of money? - says he found a wallet. - Awallet? What'd your mother say? she says she loves her new TV and she looks wonderful in her new dress. - Where is he? - He's sleeping. sleeping? It's two in the afternoon. What's he sleeping for? Tommy, what are you doing? - Tommy. - scott. Where you been? - I thought you were my pal. - I am but I'm sleeping. Well, get up. I want to see you. Look, I gotta finish this dream. - What are you dreaming? - I'm dreaming I'm sleeping. Well, I got lunch out there foryou, so get up, OK? Come on, get up. scott! Turn that thing off! Rachel, there was a pack of cigarettes in this. Thanks. You know I can't have that. About time you got up. - Hey, my show. - All right, sleepyhead. You are up. (Mom) she won the car! Junk. Must've been up pretty late last night. I don't know. Tom. How's about you and me going down to the centre tomorrow and shooting some hoops? - No. I got otherthings to do. - Come on, Tom. Just you and me, like old times. say yes. Come on. say yes. Fine. (sirens) You wear some very nice clothes these days. so you like 'em? Yeah. Wish I could afford to dress that way. Where'd you get the money? - How long you had that tattoo? - It's awesome, huh? It's all right. When you're an old man, though, you gotta wear long-sleeved shirts. I'll be a rich old man. When you're rich, nobody cares about tattoos. Is that right? You remember when I told you I had a drinking problem? And what happened to my kid? I felt responsible for his death and everything? Yeah, I really felt bad about that. No. I know you did. That was really, really difficult for me to tell you. And not many people know about it. But I did tell you because I trust you. You're my friend. - (shattering glass) - Bingo! All right! I never bullshit you, so don't bullshit me. Where'd you get that money? I found a wallet, OK? Look, I know. I know it's hard foryou. You don't have the things you want orthe things you need. But there's different ways of getting it, man. ljust don't want you to be tempted to do it the wrong way. You are so smart. I don't know if there's anyone in this world I care about more than you. ljust want to see you do it the right way. Let's go. One more. Go ahead. - (shattering glass) - Yes! Come here. I didn't break any rules. The hospital has his record. It doesn't give you the right to call an officer a horse's rear end. - I didn't... - You smoked in front of a client - in a nonsmoking area. - I called him an asshole. - Got any other problems, Barnes? - Damn right I do. I don't have enough time and you've doubled our caseload. How can I do my field work? You spend too much time in the field. All you need is in the files. - Bullshit. - You've been bucking the system since you got here. Get with the programme oryou'll be out of a job. You'd like that, wouldn't you? I wouldn't mind. You got a long wait cos I ain't going nowhere. (Door slams) We need some food. The way you eat... All right, Mom. I'll take care of it. You got a little extra for me? I ran out. I... (snoring) (Bottles clink) (# Pop music) (scott) He cares more about paperwork than people and he wants to fire me. (Man) Tell him to shove it and get out. And do what, go back to advertising? Come on. Listen, you could still write your own ticket. You could re-enter without touching down. Everything you had, you'd get back in six months. I don't know. I've been gone forfouryears. I've been soberforfouryears. I mean, that's good, isn't it? But this, come on. It's not me. What "this"? Look, what do you get out of that job anyway? I feel like I'm helping people who need it. That's bullshit. I don't feel I can help anybody. I feel so fucking paralysed. - Listen. You gotta help yourself. - I know. You better start making money. You'll wind up like one of your cases. - I know that. - Come on. You got only one thing to live for. That is the programme. When you break the rules, you hurt everybody. Burn him! (Whooping and yelling) (Chanting) No, don't! Don't! (Crowd) Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! - Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! - (Cries of pain) (screaming) (Chanting and screaming continue) I'll see you next week, OK? Be good. OK. You want to tell me something? If you were in a club or something and wanted to quit but were afraid to... What kind of club? I don't know, just some guys. You know, the only way to quit something is to just quit. Yeah, but what if they'd hurt you? If anyone hurts you or even threatens to hurt you, you let me know and I'll take care of it. You understand me? You just talk to me. You let me know. You promise? say yes. say yes. say yes. OK. Yes, all right? How bad are you? - I'm really bad, all right? - I said how bad are you? - I'm really bad, man. - Come on, show me. - You want to? - That's right. - Your mother's overthere. - What? That's enough. You can let me down now. Hello! (scott) You think you're too old to be on my shoulder. Mrs saunders, if you want your daughter and the baby to live with you, get on a detox programme. I will escort you there. And you will cash your vouchers with me and we will buy whateverthe baby needs. - You hear me? - (Phone) - Barnes. - scott, listen. Tommy hasn't been home for a couple of nights and I'm getting worried. Did you call Pedro? He spends a lot of time with Pedro. - Just call Pedro's. - OK. What do I tell Mom? Well, tell your mother not to worry. Hold on a second. Wait a minute. I'm not through with you. sit down. I'll call you later, Rachel. Don't worry about it. Bye-bye. If I find that one penny from these funds is used for crack and not the baby, you will be disqualified from receiving funds and the baby will be taken away from you. Is that clear? - 'Hello.' - Rachel? Hi. - 'Oh, scott... ' - still no word? 'No.' I'm in forthe night so when you hearfrom him, call me, OK? - 'AII right.' - OK. - Bye-bye. - 'Bye.' (Phone) - Yeah. - (Rachel) 'I called the morgue.' - What? - 'They said Tommy's dead.' Don't assume anything. I'll be right there. - How long was he missing? - A day and a night. - How old was he? - 13. - Did he have any birthmarks? - You are jumping to conclusions. - Back off. - Was he into drugs? What's the matter with you guys? If you aren't ready forthis, we can do it anothertime. Let me do this. Ohhh. Mm-mm. - That's not him. - You're lucky. This boy died a horrible death. Call sergeant Palco at this number. You should report your boy missing. This tattoo, does that mean anything to you? I don't know what it is. Must be popularthough. Third one this month. Really? It's not him, honey. Where is he? - (Car horn) - Let's go, man. - Pedro! - Come on! Hey, Pedro! Hey! Pedro, I need to talk to you. Please, wait! (Car horn) - Man, you want some suicide? - What? - How many rocks you want? - This is Tommy Burke. - You seen him? - (Tyres squealing) - (Gunman) I told you to stay at your corner. - Please. (Doors slam, tyres squeal) (sirens) This kind of thing takes a back seat to major crime. so unless you've got some substantial evidence, - we gotta treat it like it's a runaway. - It's not a runaway. Look, I have evidence. There's a tattoo. I saw it on the kid in the morgue last night and on the kid this afternoon. - It's the same one that Tommy's got. - What kind of tattoo? Initials with eastern shit going through it. - Y-l-P? - Yeah, that's it. What is that? That's the Youth Incentive Programme. - It's crack. - No, no. Tommy wouldn't be dealing crack. I hearyou but even if he is, I couldn't help you. If he's a runaway, that's not a priority and if he's into drugs, you can't help me? - Why did they send me to you? - I don't know. It's a matterfor Narcotics. You're retiring and it's evident that you don't want to do your job, so enjoy yourself. - Go do your gardening or whatever... - Hey, Barnes. Barnes! - Come here. - What? My retirement's got nothing to do with this. You don't listen. You're in the wrong department. You want help? I can get you help. - All right? - All right. Follow me. No. I'm convinced he's being held by this crack ring. I'll tell you what, Mr Barnes. lf, during our investigation, we find the boy you're looking for, - you'll be the first to know. - Are you retiring, too? - How do you know he's innocent? - Because I know the kid. For God's sake, he's only 13. We've got 13-year-olds with shoe boxes filled with more cash than I make in a year. I know a 14-year-old with two Mercedes. And he can't even drive. Take some advice. Go home and stay where it's safe. Do some social work. You saw it foryourself. This crack gang, they're not nice. They're killers. If they've got him, there's no way you're gonna get him out. What would you do? If it were your son, what would you do? My son wouldn't be out there. Then you're a very lucky man. Thanks forthe help. sorry I said what I did about you. That's OK. I don't like gardening anyway. What? - What are you gonna do? - stay away from this operation. The kid's probably dead and I don't want that prick Barnes anywhere near. Lieutenant, is something going down? I said it wasrt any of your business. Am I going crazy here or didn't I say stay the fuck away? All right, everybody, wake your little asses up. Move! Hey. I'm talking to you. Wake the fuck up. You boys are here to learn a lesson. some of you were up and you fucked up. Nobody quits. stay out of trouble, you get back on the streets. Fuck up and you go to the Madison House and I'll throw your ass in the pit. (Door slams) Get me another beer. Martha, that's not gonna help. Who in the hell are you to tell me what's gonna help? Tommy's gone and you're having dinner? What are you gonna do about it? He's in trouble. You don't even care. How can you say that? Tommy's like my own kid. - Well, then God help us. - Mom. I gotta go. How dare you tell me that? How can you say that I don't care when you accepted his expensive gifts and his money? And pretended you didn't know what was going on? And you, too. And then you blame it on me. How dare you? Tom! Tom! - Hey, Tommy! - I ain't Tommy. Get your hands off me, man! - Get off! - Go. Let's get out of here. (Thunder) (Crash) sucker! - How you doing, Justin? - still standing, James. Do that. Good evening, sir. - Yes, sir. Thank you. - (# Light jazz) - What can I get you, sir? - Club soda, please. Thank you. Can I get you something? she'll have an Absolut Vodka on the rocks. Very good. What is a beautiful woman like you doing all alone in a bar like this? I'm not alone, I'm with you. You used to be. That's right. How could I forget? You were always drunk. - Would you like another Club soda? - No, thank you. - Now you're not? - Fouryears. - I'm so proud of you. - Me, too. How the hell are you? It's good to see you. Excuse me. Just back off, James. Just tell Carlos I'll be right there, OK? Look, I gotta go. It was great seeing you... No. Please. I'd like to see you again. - You really want to see me again? - I really want to see you again. - When? - Tomorrow. All right. Here's my card. - Call me. - Good seeing you, Jackie. It's good seeing you, too. Welcome to your new home. (# Mellow jazz) I thought of so many funny things last night. - Like what? - I flashed on... that first time in san Francisco, you know, at the Travelodge? You're a lot quieterthan I remember. I'm sorry. I've just had a lot on my mind lately. so, what's it like being a hotshot lawyer? I'm not a hotshot. What kind of cases do you work on? You know. A bit of this, a bit of that. Let's change the subject. What I mean is, I haven't felt this good in a long time, and I'd rather just be with you. To us. To us. I'll be right back. God. No, no. What are you doing? - What the fuck are you doing? - I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd check out what you do. Bullshit. Who are you calling? Jackie, who are you calling? You fucker. I knew it was too good to be true. I knew it! Wait a minute. Hey! Hey! This is not what you think. I'm not a cop. - Then what are you? - I'm a social worker. Then why are you going through my files? There's a kid that I've been working with. He's missing and I'm certain he's involved with the Youth Incentive Programme. ljust thought maybe... I thought maybe you'd help me out with it. I was gonna tell you. I was gonna tell you at the right time. I... What? I'm sorry, I... scott, I'm their lawyer. I'm not their business partner. somebody gets busted, I get them out of jail. If they want to buy property, I draw up the paperwork. If I start poking around into their other areas, they'll know something is up. Their other areas are crack. You don't have to tell me what it is! I never meant it to turn out this way. What am I going to do? There must be some way you could get me in there. The only way to get in is if you're dealing drugs. (sighs) They'd kill me if they even knew I was talking to you about this. Is there any other way you could get me in? Wait a minute. I haven't said I'd get you in anywhere. You said you've been talking to the cops. If you screw up, Carlos will implicate me, too. There's no way that he could everfind out about you. I don't want the organisation, ljust want the kid. - It's too dangerous. - Are you loyal to these assholes? Come on. As if I'm supposed to be loyal to some asshole from my past who hustles me for a fuck and I get fucked over? Just wait. I didn't know that you were in that bar. I had no idea you worked forthose people. - Bullshit. - It's not bullshit. Just leave me alone! You know, you used to be somebody very special. Maybe you didn't have the fancy apartment orthese nice clothes, but... - You were someone very special. - Just shut up. Now you're all grown-up. You call yourself a lawyer. You're not a lawyer. That's just a lie to keep from seeing that you're a criminal. And you're a guilty alcoholic trying to make up for killing his own kid. Have a great life. Enjoy your money. (Boss) As you all know, we've had another budget cut. so we've got to stop wasting time on marginal cases. some of those marginal cases are people on the streets, Will. - I won't get into this... - They're not numbers. Wait a minute. This isn't a staff meeting, so watch it! I bring up an issue and you threaten me? No, I'm not threatening you but you seem to be the prince of marginal cases. And the rules of this department mean nothing to you. You'd rather be looking for some punk kid than in here doing your job. Fuck you, man. That kid happens to be important to me. - What did you say? - I said, fuck you! And while you're at it, fuck your goddamn papers, too. - Asshole! - That's it, Barnes! I have got witnesses. Your ass is out of here! Good. - (scott) 'Don't leave me, Linda.' - 'No. I'm going. I can't take this any more.' (scott) 'I haven't had a drink in a long time.' (Linda) 'since when? say it. 'You haven't had a drink since Trevor died. 'He's dead, scott, and every time I look at you, 'I think about how you took my son from me.' (scott) 'I want things to be the same.' (Linda) 'They're not and they never will be.' - Why are you telling me this? - I don't want it to happen again. - Different circumstances. Not the same. - I know, but... My little boy, I was too drunk to pull him out of that car. And I lost somebody and that is the same. - But you would have both died. - That would have been better. But I'm not shitfaced now. Well, I'll see what I can do but you understand, this is unofficial. I understand that. All right. Let me ask around. Where'd you get this coffee? - Bad? - This is the worst fucking coffee. My Lord. Thank you. (Phone) - Hello. - 'It's me.' - Jackie. - 'I need to talk to you.' - OK. When? - 'In an hour at Marina Park.' You've got it. stop it, Chris. They'll meet with you. You're not in yet, so it's not too late to back out. I told them you were an old friend of mine. They trust me, so when you find the kid, you can't just quit orthey'll suspect me. You'll have to stick around for a while and then disappear. And I mean really disappear. - When do we meet? - They'll contact you. I don't know when and I don't wanna know. You're on your own, OK? Can I see you again? Drop the act. You got what you wanted. It's not an act. Give me some time. (Man) Move it! We gotta get this shit on the street. Pedro, here. What are you doing? You trying to fuck with me? You're gonna be my little clean-up boy. Better watch your ass. - My name's Carlos. - scott. You just got dumped from social services and you have $350 in the bank. - You did your homework. - You bet your ass. This here's serious business. - What do you drink? - Club soda, if you got it. If I got it? (Laughs) I got everything. And what I don't got, I'm gonna get real soon. sit down. Take a look at me. Take a good fucking look. What do you see? You see a kid, don't you? Let me set you straight. I'm 21 years old and I am won'th And nobody fucks with me and gets away with it. The people who work for me follow orders. They're not allowed to do drugs. They do what I say when I say. The name of the game is Youth Incentive Programme and I'm the chairman of the board. Neverforget that. Thank you. James here is my man. He'll take you around, show you how the business operates, cos I can tell by looking at you, you don't know shit. You wouldn't be sitting here now if Jackie hadrt bragged on you. If I'd have seen you first, I'd have said, fuck it. The motherfucker's too dumb. What would you like me to do? The fucker's got style! Good. That's very good. OK. Now, here's the story. We're going to put the move on the suburbs. Instead of kids driving in looking for drugs, we're going to take the goods to them. And you, you're gonna be my contact man. You're gonna set up the locations and pay off the right people. They won't do business with me. We'll stick you in a suit and they'll climb over each otherto give you the money. - What's my end? - We'll get to that later. In the meantime, you stick with James. It's Reggie. Where the fuck are you? You keep it up, man, and I'll throw your ass in the pit! You fucking asshole! The fuck is a fed, I know it! Take it easy. You're paranoid. Who are you calling paranoid? And get his ass out of here! Vincent, drive him home. Be ready, 5pm tomorrow. OK. Puta! And I don't trust him. something's up with Jackie. she's been acting shitty lately! You're right. What do you want to do? You let him see as little as you can. Keep an eye on him day and night. If he's not cool... you kill them both. (James) All right. The little kids take the orders. The lady with the baby carriage supplies the crack. That boy there is the lieutenant. He takes the money and makes sure everything's running right. The two wrecking crew members up there? Those are the lookouts. Nobody gets on this block without being spotted. It's just like the army. Everyone has his rank. Why do you use such young kids? Because they never have to do time. Juvenile homes are too full. The only place to put these kids is back on the street. seen enough? - Barnes made it in. - We gotta get him out. son of a... No. No, we don't. We'll leave him. Carlos goes crazy when a big shipment is coming in. He'll take any of the heat off my boy. We finally know when the drugs are coming in. - We'll finally nail the can'tel... - Boss, if he's caught, he's a dead man. That's his problem. The operation stays on sche... - How long you been there? - ljust walked up. What are you guys so paranoid about? All right. What do you want? I was wondering if you guys wanted to go bowling after work, but... Nah, I can see you're too busy. What are you doing here? I said I needed some time. I know. It's been almost 20 hours. What am I going to do with you? You're gonna let me in. (# Funky rock) - All these kids work for Carlos? - Every one of them. There's a thousand more waiting to take their jobs. They're too poor and too scared to fuck up more than once. If they do, they'll pay the price. What do they do when they end up in the wrecking crew? You'll see. (Wild cheering) What we have here is ten of the hardest-working motherfuckers in the whole damn city. And that's gold, 18-carat gold. And them are diamonds and diamonds and more diamonds! And that's not all, no way. Because when you work hard, things happen. (AIl) Yeah! Because when you work hard, you can go places. Yeah! And when you work hard, you could be like me! Excuse me, where's James? Fuck off, asshole. (Carlos) You didn't come in 15 minutes. We told you what would happen if you fucked with my money. Where the fuck is my money, you little shit? - I don't have the money. - shut up, you little fuck! - You haven't done shit for me. - Please, you gotta believe me. sorry, man. I didn't mean it. Nobody messes with my money. I told you that before. - sorry. - Nobody! Nobody! Nobody! You take him to Madison. Move it! (Whispers) Hey, man. You OK? I gotta get outta here. Don't do that. That's a bad idea. No. Don't do it. Get the fuck out of the way. - Jesse! - Yes? Give me a hand downstairs, man. Be right there. I warned you. Che Che, what's happening? Ain't nothing to it, James. This is your basic hook-up joint. Move it around every couple of days. All these boys in trouble? They're with Che Che, they're in deep shit. Ain't that right? The Grim Reaper, brother. - That's not a good idea. - Who are the guys in the van? - The wrecking crew. - What do they do? Let's just say they solve problems. Is it all right if I look around? - That's what you're here for. - All right. Pedro. - How'd you get in here? - Where's Tom? Wrecking crew took him. He's in real trouble. - Where did they take him? - The Madison House. - When did they take him? - Just a few minutes ago. - You gotta help me get outta here. - (Man) Pedro! - Help me, scott, please. - Where the hell are you? - A corporate name? - I don't know if it's a first name. - There is nothing here. - He said Madison. - I've never heard of it. - Fuck! God damn it! - Why didn't I ask for an address? shit. - Calm down. Calm down. If I don't find him soon, I'm gonna find him dead. OK, this is what we're gonna do. I want you to call me at 3pm at this number, OK? - Why? - Just do it. If someone else answers, I want you to hang up. - You got that? - What are you doing? - Best you don't know. - I'm not sure about that. I am. Now look, three o'clock exactly. If I don't answer, you hang up. You got that? - OK. - Good. - Under one condition. - What? You gotta promise me that when the time comes foryou to disappear... you'll take me with you. What if today's the day? Then today's the day. OK. Thank you. Madison? I never heard of it. - Tomorrow? - Yes, tomorrow. - 'They know about you.' - What do you mean? - Who knows about me? - Ortega. They got a man inside. They'll sacrifice you, so get out now. I can't. I know where Tommy is. I gotta be there. - I can't help you then. - Bailing out on me, Palco? - 'I'm retiring.' - so what? 'You plan to die when you retire? You're already dead.' All I'm asking is just check it out for me. Just be there for me. Don't do anything until I get back to you, OK? 'OK, Barnes? 'Barnes, I'm not hearing what I want to hear, man.' Fine. OK. (# Reggae) - How we doing? - Good. Vince, let's run by the south side. Don't you got a meeting with Leon at three? shit. That's right. We're late. We got all day, man. How long is it before... Not long. And Vincent? - Yeah, man? - Turn that shit down. sure thing, man. - All right. - Yeah, man? Run scott home and then go back to Carlos'. I'll be here a while. I'll get a ride from Leors people. All right? - Yeah, man. - All right. - I'll catch you tomorrow. - You got it. All right. (Phone) - Hello? - scott, I'm sorry I'm late. - Carlos, hi. It's scott. - What is going on? Yeah, hold on a minute. Hold on. Carlos wants us to meet him at the Madison House. - Madison? - Yeah. You know how to get there? sure thing. Tell the boss we on the way. Good. We'll meet you there. - What are you doing? - Today is the day.
