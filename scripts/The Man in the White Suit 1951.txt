The trouble began-- Not in my own mill, i'm glad to say-- But during my visit to the mill owned by michael corland, Which manufactures an artificial fiber, similar to my own. Corland is a personable young man, Who seemed to have impressed my daughter. He was also anxious to impress me, With the idea that his mill was a sound financial investment. Output is excellent. Six million yards of filament a day. How many ? Six million. That's right, isn't it, hill ? Six million feet. Yes, mr. Corland. Feet, of course. [ Chuckles ] of course. Good morning. I'm lunching here with mr. Corland and my father. They're still looking around the mill, miss birnley. Would you care to wait in mr. Corland's off-- Um, michael. Hello, daddy. Good morning, mr. Hill. Now, now, daphne, please don't interrupt. I'm having a most illuminating tour. This way ? This way, mr. Birnley. Oh, this way. Thank you. How's it going ? Sticky. Why, what does he say ? Oh, nothing. That's the trouble. Oh, that's only his "kingpin of industry" act. "Forty glorious years in textiles." Don't let it get you down. I'm sure he'll put up all the money you want. [ Clattering ] Sorry... sir. Come on. Come on. Of course, it's hardly up to what you have at birnleys. Quite. Eh, for instance, sir, if you'd step this way. Mr. Green, perhaps you would show mr. Birnley... The latest thing you've been working on. [ Liquid bubbling ] [ Rhythmic bubbling, gurgling ] Just a moment, green. Thank you. What's this ? I really couldn't say, mr. Birnley. Mr. Green, Perhaps you would explain. Gladly. Well, it's, uh-- Obviously, it's, uh-- [ Whistles ] [ Green ] mr. Wilkins ? Yes, sir. Is, uh, this yours ? No, sir. [ Green ] harrison ? [ Wheezes ] Yours ? No, sir. I thought it was... his. [ Men chattering ] well, does it matter, really ? Merely a matter of interest. Fotheringay ? Could you spare us a moment ? What is this ? [ Rhythmic bubbling, gurgling continues ] Don't you know ? I think it was a special job. Who for ? Come along. Come along. Who authorized it ? Apparently you did. [ Corland ] really, mr. Green, you must know whether you did or did not. [ All talking at once ] What does it matter, anyway ? I think you're being very ru-- There must be some quite ordinary explanation. It's ridiculous. The thing can't have grown there. Mr. Hill, will you please find out what this is about ? Yes, sir. Green, check with the accounts department. Of course. Take them the order number. Uh, very good, sir. Right away, sir. "3-7-8-2-5. 3-7-8-2-5." "3-7-8-2-5. 3-7-8-2-5." [ Rhythmic bubbling, gurgling continues ] [ Chattering ] I'm so sorry. I really shouldn't start asking questions. On the contrary. Shall we lunch ? Yes. I think you've seen just about everything. Yes, i think i have. "3-7-8-2-5." Here it is. [ Diners chattering ] 4,000 ? But spent on what ? Hydrogen, sir. Heavy hydrogen. This is absolute nonsense ! Oh, for heaven's sake ! I want to aim at materials and designs, Combining the strength and simplicity... Of the old english hand loom weavers, with the color and fire... Of the flemish or provenal. Now, if i had an extra hundred thousand-- Ahem. Excuse me, sir. After lunch, hill. It's very urgent. After lunch, hill ! Where was i ? Well, you mustn't let us keep you from anything vital. No, it's nothing. Nothing. [ Coughing ] What is it, michael ? It's nothing. Excuse me, will you, please ? So i told him. Mr. Wilkins ! Yes ? Mr. Corland wants you. He's in accounts. Mr. Harrison ! [ Gulps, coughs ] They want you, too, in accounts. Excuse me. Could you tell me where mr. Corland is please ? [ Bubbling continues ] [ Woman ] stratton ! Mr. Corland wants you ! No, mr. Corland, you're not firing me. I resign. I'm not a cheat, nor a swindler. I did what i did because there was no other way. I may have had just a menial job here, but at cambridge, They gave me a first and a fellowship. I would be there still if they hadn't been so shortsighted. Just as you are and all the others i've worked for. But one day, there'll be someone with real vision. I shall have a laboratory given to me. A proper laboratory, with really modern equipment. And assistants of my own. No, don't interrupt me. It's small minds like yours that stand in the way of progress. But this is too big a thing, bigger than you-- [ Water sloshing ] I see you've been discharged from your last six positions. Seven. Oh. Oh, well, perhaps a change in environment might-- Oh, no, it must be a textile mill. I see there's a vacancy at the birnley mill, but-- Birnleys ? Yes, but-- They have a research lab, haven't they ? I'm afraid this hardly suits your qualifications. They want a works laborer. Oh, that'll suit me. [ Machinery clacking ] That's a nice place to leave it, isn't it ? Sorry. [ Hits door ] [ Clattering ] Sorry. Don't mention it. You've got it loaded too heavy. Have i ? You want to leave it so you can see over the top. Oh. Yes, of course. Thanks. New, aren't you ? Uh, yes. Never worked in a mill before ? Oh, yes, several. I know. Leave school, Into the first blind alley job that comes along. Too old for that. Into another and another. By the time you're 30, what are you ? Flotsam floating on the flood tide of profits. There's capitalism for you. It wasn't quite like that. I got a scholarship to cambridge. But you hadn't got the old school tie. Oh, you can't tell me. Discrimination. I've seen plenty. Where were you going with this lot ? The loading bay, i think they call it. You were going the wrong way anyhow. It's down there. [ Siren wails ] tea up. Better leave it. Oh, tea ? No thanks. I think i'd rather-- Tea break ! We had to fight for it. Just a moment. Look, uh, we'd better help you with it. It's very delicate. Yes, sir. Pete, give us a hand with this. And get these gentlemen some overalls. Well, where's sid ? Sid ! Sid ! No, no, quite wrong. Sid ! Where's it got to go ? Up to the lab. It's an electro-- And electrola-- An electron microscope. Ah, at last ! We'd better go and check this over. Mm, it's a beautiful job. No, no ! You must have the gun filament off before you switch on the projector, Otherwise you're liable to put 4,000 volts through the cathode... And blow it to bits. Quite. That's the specimen stage i suppose. The intermediate alignment section. This is the specimen stage. Of course. [ Man ] it seems to be all right. If the chief's satisfied, we'll go. I don't suppose you could spare someone for a while, Just till we get the hang of it ? What, me ? Well, not necessarily you yourself. One of your assistants, perhaps. Well, i see. Well, i-I think perhaps i might manage it. In fact, it might be quite convenient. You sure you're not too, uh, busy ? There are a few things, of course, but... If while i'm here, you could let me have a corner of a bench. Oh, certainly, certainly. Uh, see to that, will you, wilson ? I couldn't say, i'm sure. All right, love. Tell her she can pay it friday. He didn't say nothing this morning. [ Children playing ] Sid, what's all this ? Harry says you've quit. Oh, yes, yes. Why ? Well, you see, i-- You didn't get sacked ? Oh, no, no, no. Then, what happened ? Well, i've got the chance of another job. Where ? At birnleys, too, in a way. You haven't quit, then ? Yes and no. I got the chance of working in the laboratory. It's a better job. Oh, yes, much. And more money ? Well, i shan't actually get paid for it. What ? We'll see about that. Scab labor. Huh. The works committee had better hear about this. But i don't want to get paid. Not want to ? I don't care whether you want to get paid or not. You've got to get paid. Bertha, you mustn't do that. It'll ruin everything. It's only for a few weeks. I promise you. What are you going to do for money ? I was going to speak to you about that, mrs. Watson. I know it's a lot to ask, but... if i could owe you the rent for a couple weeks-- Only the rent-- I shan't need any food. You'll not need food ? Oh, i'll get that somewhere. Of course you can stay, mr. Stratton. Thanks very much, indeed. [ Train passing by ] [ Children playing outside ] [ Knock on door ] [ Objects rattling ] [ knock on door ] Sid, are you in trouble ? No. Everything's fine. I've... got some money in the post office. Not very much, but you could have it if you need it. I can get most of what i need at the lab. But if there are a few oddments, i'll let you know. Thanks. Anytime. I'm even glad, michael. You get no money from father. All right. I'm freer to say we'll get married as soon as you like. You're-- You're very sweet, but i'm not going to let you. What do you mean, michael ? I wouldn't dream of letting you marry me in a fit of temper. Not until you can do it in perfectly cold blood. Well, i must be off. I have to look around in some other direction. [ Door closes ] daddy. I thought you'd gone, daphne. Father, i know what you think about michael. You think all he wants is my money. Hmm. Mine. Well, it just so happens you're wrong. He's going to find some other way to do all the things he wants. Splendid ! And he still wants me ! Well, if you want him, daphne, Then i'm very glad. So, now will you change your mind about him ? Well, if that means-- Will i invest in him in spite of what i've seen of his mills-- No. Just because there was a lunatic in the place, you blame him. It might have happened to anyone. In the birnley mills, for instance ? I'm sick of the birnley mills... And everything connected with them. And the sooner i leave home, the happier i shall be. Sorry. Hey ! Wait ! Hm, hm, hm. Well, all right. [ Rhythmic bubbling and gurgling ] Ah, mr. Stratton. I don't quite see your point about this. Daddy, just a minute. I-- [ Horn honks ] - [ Tires skid ] - Miss birnley ! Please don't tell your father. You're working for him now. How nice. Does he know ? I can't wait to tell him. Miss birnley ! Look, miss birnley ! Get off ! Just give me two more days. One even. It's more important than anything. It's going to astound the world ! [ Tires skid ] Look. You know about the problem of polymerizing amino acid residues ? What did you say ? Look. You know what a long-Chain molecule is ? A what ? Do you know what a molecule is ? No. Something like an atom ? That's it ! Atoms stuck together. In this case, like a long chain. Now, cotton and silk and every natural fiber is made up of these chains. And recently we've learned to make artificial fibers with even longer chains, Such as, um, rayon and nylon. You've heard of nylon ? Well, i think i've succeeded in the copolymerization... Of amino acid residues and carbohydrate molecules. Both containing ionic groups. It's really perfectly simple. I believe i've got the right catalyst to promote interaction... Between the reactive groups at the end of the peptide chains... And the carbohydrate combination, While the charges of the ionic groups will cross-Link the chains... And confer valuable elastic properties. At high temperature and pressure-- [ Daphne mumbling ] "...And give a molten liquid so that there is a great probability of... "Polymerization... "To give a natural molecule of a length great enough... To confer spinnability." Just wanted something to read in bed. Good night, daddy. [ Tolling ] [ Rhythmic bubbling, gurgling ] [ Rhythmic bubbling, gurgling stops ] Well, after all, how the devil can i do anything about it ? What's this ? Hey ! Here, i need that ! Terribly sorry. It's very important. Just a minute. I'm using that. - What's all this ? - Where's mr. Birnley ? I've got to see mr. Birnley. Mr. Stratton, what's the matter ? Mr. Hoskins, it's worked. I've done it ! Done what ? The radioactive groups in the fiber-Forming molecules... Haven't catalyzed the internal rearrangement. Not in the least. I thought the polymerization would be sterically hindered. But it wasn't. It wasn't. Where are my notes ? Mr. Stratton-- I'll see you later. I've got to see mr. Birnley. - You can't do that. - I've done it ! I've done it ! Stop him ! Stop him ! [ Arguing ] Don't let him go ! Don't let him go ! [ Phone rings ] - Nurse gamage. - I've got to see mr. Birnley. You're fired. You understand ? Fired ! You can't fire me. I don't work here. What ? That's right. He doesn't. [ Men arguing ] now then ? [ Hoskins ] ah, sister ! Come here. What's the trouble ? He's mad, that's the trouble. A strong sedative, that's what he needs. Fantastic. Utterly fantastic. A lunatic, obviously. Yes, sir. Very odd, indeed. [ Raining ] [ Doorbell rings ] I want to see mr. Birnley. I can't get any sense out of the rest of them. It's terribly important. Your name. My name, it's... stratton. Sidney stratton. I work at the mill. That is, i did work at the mill. Only i-- You have an appointment ? No, but you see, i know that-- It would have been better had you made an appointment. Mr. Birnley's busy now. A meeting. But i couldn't make an appointment. Sorry. Write a letter or telephone. [ Rings doorbell ] There's no question of it. But, mr. Birnley-- It's all very well between these four walls, but what are the shareholders going to say ? 8,300 for sundries ? What sundries ? Davidson will be here at any moment. Now, he should be able to answer that. [ Brakes squeak ] [ Car door closes ] [ Doorbell rings ] Oh, mr. Birnley's expecting you. No, please, listen. Let me explain ! Please ! Please ! What's all this ? Oh, it's nothing. [ Doorbell ringing repeatedly ] [ Doorbell stops ringing ] Please give this to mr. Birnley. I promise you he'll want to see me. I expect my works manager to know everything, davidson, down to the smallest detail. I should hardly call 8,000 a detail. Judging by the job numbers, mr. Birnley, hoskins must know. Well, who's hoskins ? Your head of research, sir. Well, can you find his private number, or is it too much to hope ? Oh, do try. How can it be impossible ? I've got them here. But-- Let me speak to him. Oh, it's you. Hello. Have you done it ? Yes, i have, but i-- Come right in. Look. Listen, i'm asking you a simple question. What is it, knudsen ? No, i don't care what his name is. I want to know what he-- Very well, then. You must find him and send him up here. No, certainly not. Tell him to go away. What do you mean, you can't ? Well, you must know his address. Why, hang it all, he's an employee. Now, look here. He said to go away. - She's gone to fetch him. Really, she has. - Daphne, have you gone mad ? I'm in the middle of a difficult meeting. I don't know what you're talking about. How can you if you won't listen ? Whatever it is can wait for half an hour. This friend of yours can't be so important-- [ Crash ] No, don't, don't, don't ! Please, don't ! Ah, there you are at last ! Now listen to me. No, daphne. I will not listen to you. Get out ! I won't. Daddy ! Knudsen ! [ Doorbell rings ] You're an irresponsible young idiot. Knudsen ! Father ! And you're a pompous and ungrateful old ass. Oh ! Sidney ! Knudsen ! Knudsen ! [ Doorbell ringing ] knudsen ! No, father, listen to me. Knudsen ! If you think i'd give it to you, you must be crazy, not if you were the last man on earth. Even if i liked you, i wouldn't give it to you if you went down... On your knees and begged for it. Knudsen. I won't stay in your house another minute. Oh ! You've made an idiot of yourself, father. And i'm delighted to say you're going to regret it. You need a good spanking. You don't even know what he's done. Well, apart from costing me 8,000, what has he done ? He's made a new kind of cloth. It never gets dirty, and it lasts forever. Well, that's ridiculous. Oh, it is, is it ? Do you know what a long-Chain molecule is ? Do you know what happens if one makes one of infinite length... With optimum interchain attractions ? Do you know what it means ? It means that to break the fiber, you'd have to split the molecule. It means, for all practical purposes, it would last forever. And it has a surface charge of static electricity. It repels dirt. That may be nonsense, of course. Maybe he hasn't really done it. Maybe he's talking through his hat. On the other hand, maybe he has. Maybe you're talking through yours. The point is you don't know, And you're too pigheaded to find out. [ Door slams ] [ Man ] 8,300. They're bound to ask questions. Stratton, you're coming straight away with me to see mister-- Ah, hoskins. I've decided to authorize mr. Stratton... To continue his research here. [ Chuckles ] I'm sure i can rely on you to give him everything he needs. Yes, sir. Well, there you are, sidney. [ Chuckles ] well, you've got your contract. And you'll get your equipment. Now, is there anything else ? [ Coughs ] there is just one thing. Yes, my boy. I've been thinking about the possibility of... chain reactions. And i think probably we ought to... clear the lab. Clear the lab ? Only as a precaution. Secrecy, you mean ? Th-That too. [ Chuckles ] You're a shrewd boy. See about that, hoskins. And you'll see that not a word gets out about this, even in the mills. Well, perhaps we shall have a little surprise to spring on our competitors. [ Chuckles ] yes. [ Birnley laughing ] [ Rhythmic bubbling, gurgling ] Well, there we are. Shall we try it now, Or do you think we ought to wait until after lunch ? Whatever you say. Let's have a go now. Oh, sorry. Mr. Hoskins ? Next door. Thanks. [ Clattering ] oh, mr. Hoskins. Good morning. I didn't know where to find you at first. Would you just okay these for accounts, please ? It does seem an extraordinary amount. I suppose it's necessary. My dear king-- [ Explosion ] [ Glass breaking underfoot ] It shouldn't have done that. Accounts have sent us a rough estimate, sir. 18,749. Mm-Hmm. Might be worse. Plus, two thousand to cover the damage to the building. What ? Oh, i see. Anything else ? Yes, sir. Radioactive thorium ! Well, what does he want that for ? [ Explosion ] What ? Shut the door. There's another one due at any moment. What is it all for, exactly ? It's a lot of tomfoolery if you ask me. [ Ring ] Hello, yes, hoskins here. Manchester daily express here. We heard there were some accidents in the laboratory. Explosion. I just wondered if there was a story in it. Must be some stupid rumor. Of course, we are making some structural alterations. [ Clears throat ] but that's all. Yes, right. Good-Bye. - There's the-- - [ Explosion ] Uh-Oh. There go the fireworks again. Good as blackpool, eh, frank ? Someone will get hurt if it goes on. If anyone does, it'll be sid. He's the one who's taking all the chances. And if you was any kind of a shop steward, You'd be getting him danger money. Fat lot he needs it. Jumped out of his overalls into a cushy job pretty fast... And a cushy pay packet too. Well, whatever he gets, he earns all right. It's birnley's pockets he's lining, or they wouldn't have pushed him into it. And a fat lot they care if he goes through the roof. Me too. [ Rhythmic bubbling, gurgling ] Well... here's hoping. I must frankly admit that i'm discouraged. Very discouraged. No one's allowed in, sir. Yes, i know. Mr. Stratton's orders, sir. Mr. Birnley's orders. He gave me strict instructions, sir. I hardly think that applies to us. [ Rhythmic bubbling, gurgling ] Well, what are we waiting for ? Would you like to ? It's easy. No. [ Rhythmic bubbling, gurgling stops ] It must have worked. Were you here just now ? Yes. Why ? My dear boy, what's the matter ? Nothing. It's just that it worked. Do you mean-- Just now ? Stratton, you should have-- Davidson ! Oh. We've got it, all right. Look. We've got the answer, mr. Birnley. We can go ahead now. [ Chuckles ] [ Ticking ] Fortunately there's a chemical change at 300 degrees centigrade. [ Birnley ] hm. Quite remarkable. [ Sidney ] we shall have to do a little ground work on that. [ Man ] seven and a half. [ Man #2 ] seven and a half. - [ Sidney ] though as you say, - Thirty-Five. We shall only need to vary the intermediates to make a substitute for... Wool, cotton, linen-- Whatever you please. Yes, thirty-One. Thirty-One. And, of course, there's the question of dyeing. Excuse me. Thank you. At the moment, the fiber's intractable. It repels dye just as it does dirt. But, uh-- We shall have to, uh, Introduce the coloring matter at an earlier stage, Left shoulder. While the polymer is still in the melt. Yes, seven. Seven. You won't find any difficulty in stitching. The needle will simply pass through between the weave as usual. If he could let me have paper patterns of the suit. Paper patterns ? Yes, i shall have to have, um, Templates made and get the pieces cut out for you. Well, just as you wish. I suppose you wouldn't prefer for us to cut them out ? Oh, i'm afraid you wouldn't be able to. [ Laughs ] [ Knock on door ] Come in. [ Daphne laughing ] - Well, what's funny about it ? - It's just the suit. It looks as if it's wearing you. It's still a bit luminous. But it'll wear off. Oh, no. No ? No, it makes you look like a knight in shining armor. That's what you are. Me ? Don't you understand what this means ? Millions of people all over the world, living lives of drudgery, Fighting an endless losing battle against shabbiness and dirt. You've won that battle for them. You've set them free. The whole world's going to bless you. [ Train whistle blows ] Unbreakable ? That's what they're saying, mr. Corland. Green, is-- Is that possible ? Well, uh, if he's using a heavy hydrogen, He might get a more complex molecule. In plain language-- Yes or no ? It's, uh, possible. I'm very grateful to you, king. I-- I think the... industry will be. Get me sir john kierlaw. [ Laughing ] now, now, davidson. Hardly that, surely. Well, as soon as i have finished with the press, I should like to see the heads of all departments. [ Phone rings ] Yes ? One moment, please. It's sir john kierlaw. Sir john-- All right. I'll-- I'll speak to him. - He's here. - Here ? Michael. So it was-- Oh. [ Kierlaw breathing heavily ] No, no, the asthma atomizer. [ Inhaling atomizer ] Now, some fool... Has invented an indestructible cloth. - Right ? - Yes. Where is he ? How much does he want ? I'm afraid we have mr. Birnley to contend with first. As i understand it, mr. Birnley intends to manufacture and market this product. - Certainly. - Are you mad ? [ Birnley ] well, i consider it my duty to do it. It'll knock the bottom out of everything, down to the primary producers. What about the sheep farmers and cotton growers ? The importers and middlemen. The big stores, even. It'll ruin all of them ! The point. Let us stick to the point. - What about us ? - Well, i'll admit some individuals... May suffer temporarily. But i will not stand in the way of progress. The welfare of the community must come first. You're not likely to suffer much. Michael, that's unworthy of you. Sir john, Surely you realize this is the greatest step forward. Step forward ? Over a precipice. It means disaster. Disaster ? Was the spinning jenny a disaster ? Was the mechanical loom ? For those who didn't control them, yes. Besides, they increased output. This will finish it. Just arriving now, sir. He's the one to make the complaint, isn't he ? Well, what's this ? Worker's playtime ? It's sid ! Look whose car. Sid ! Hello, bertha. Hello. What have they done to you ? Well, it's really what i've done. We are just going to announce it to the press. Announce what ? My new fiber. Mind ! Mr. Corland. In mr. Birnley's office. It never gets dirty ? And never wears out ? That's right. Now what do you think of him ? And you think they'll go ahead with it ? Certainly. You're not even born yet. What do you think happened to all the other things ? The razor blade that never gets blunt. And the car that runs on water, with a pinch of something in it. No. They'll never let your stuff on the market in a million years. He's right, you know. Vested interest. The dead hand of monopoly. It's not like that at all, i assure you. Everything's organized. We're telling the newspapers this morning, And then going right ahead. But if this stuff never wears out, we'll only have one lot to make. - That's right. - I've been looking everywhere for you. First of all, i want to apologize. Didn't recognize a genius when i saw one. Excuse me, sir. I-- I've just come from mr. Birnley. One or two things he asked me to straighten out. [ Train whistle blows ] That's lovely. Six months's work and that'll be the lot. Every mill in the country will be laid off. It's birnley's doing. Sidney wouldn't invent a thing like that. Something oughta be done about it. Something is gonna be done. We'll get the works committee together for a start. I don't want to be selfish about it. Later on, i might be able to offer it to other manufacturers-- Under license. You want us to cut our throats... While you build up another fortune in royalties on our dying efforts ! [ Birnley ] well, after all, may i point out that i control this process. Do you ? Of course i do. A sordid matter of details, sir john. Well ? Stratton's diary of his first successful experiment-- Date: september 15. Stratton's contract with mr. Birnley-- Date: october 1. [ Stammers ] sir john. [ Wheezing ] I expect he's on his way to us now, but i'll just make sure. The works committee ? I'm sorry, mr. Birnley's busy. No. No, no, no, i can't interrupt him now. No ! No ! Mr. Davidson, wait ! You can't go there ! Sir john, kierlaw. Mr. Cranford. How do you do ? Mr. Mannering. How do you do ? Mr. Corland you know, of course. This is mr. Stratton, gentlemen. What's this ? A new contract. Sign it, young man. What was wrong with the old one ? Well, this is a big thing, sidney. Too big for one mill. And so i decided it was necessary to bring in these other gentlemen. I see. [ Intercom buzzes ] yes ? [ Woman ] mr. Birnley, it's the works committee. They say-- No, no, i'm busy. It's urgent ! It's about mr. Stratton. Mr. Birnley will see them later. I think it's all in order. Thanks. Oh, that's ingenious. - May i ? - Of course. How much petrol as against how much ink ? I really don't know. There's just one thing-- Wilson, my assistant. He's been a great help on this, and i'd like him to get some of the credit. Of course. We all realize the value of mr. Wilson's contribution. I mean, when the results are published, i'd like his name to be mentioned. There may be a little delay in publication, of course. Delay ? Oh. Why ? You see, sidney, we have to wait till the right moment. Why not now ? To announce it right away... Might upset the delicate balance of the market. Would it ? But what happens when you begin to sell the stuff ? Leave these problems to us, mr. Stratton. Just sign the document. [ Birnley ] sir john's right, sidney. You are going ahead with production ? Well, sidney, i-- I'd like to think this over. Young man, come here. We need control of this discovery. Complete control. If you want twice the amount in that contract, we'll pay it. A quarter of a million. - To suppress it ? - Yes. [ Train whistle blows ] Excuse me. [ Intercom buzzing ] Wait ! Now listen, all of you ! Sidney ! Sidney ! [ Sir john ] stop him ! [ Gasps ] [ Clattering ] This is too much no, no, no, wait. Wait, please, all of you. Yes, mr. Birnley ? S-S-Sidney, no ! - I beg your pardon, mr. Birnley ? - Miss johnson, there's a room-- [ Sir john ] stop him ! Sidney, stop that ! Look here. You can't-- [ Screams ] stop a minute ! [ Grunts ] Stop him ! Stop him ! Stop him ! For goodness sake, stop him ! Stop him. He-- He mustn't leave the mill. How can we stop him ? By force. By force ? I will not resort to violence. How else ? If he sells to anybody else, he ruins us all. Then we must reason with the boy. How can we reason with him when he's not here ? Yes, sir ? This way, gentlemen. Oh, i'm sorry. Wrong floor ! [ Clattering, thud ] Is he all right ? Yes. Pity. [ Children chattering in distance ] Any news of him ? He's up at birnley's. What did i tell ya ? Right in their pocket. You've no right to talk like that. Perhaps he can't help himself. They say he had a headache. Aye, sticks out a mile. Birnley won't see the works committee and sid can't face us. [ Knocking ] there. Mr. Stratton lives here ? Yes, but, uh-- Now he's going to live with mr. Birnley. I've come to collect his baggage. Also, to give you two weeks' rent. Now who's right ? It's just as i told you. Sitting right in their laps. [ Chattering ] Well, give me some figures. Fallen to what ? 46.9 ? No, no, no, no. No, don't sell. No, of course not. There's not a word of truth in it. Yes, yes. I'll be on-- On here till further notice. Well, that's just the beginning. [ Phone rings ] Hello, yes ? Yeah ? Calcutta ? Tomorrow'll be a nosedive. Just on these rumors. It's absurd. There must have been a leakage. Well, you should know, you started the first one. It's no good your blaming me-- You know very well-- Sir john's right. Let's keep to the point, shall we ? All right, put him on. There's only one thing that will put the market together, And that is a denial backed with suppression-- Total and permanent. Hello, mottram. How ? We've already offered him a quarter of a million. Well, we can't keep him here forever. There are one or two laws in the country. I've got it. Maybe i should talk to him, let him name his own price. I think not, michael. I will-- Gentlemen ! Gentlemen. Knudsen ? His door's locked. The key's gone. I have it, miss birnley. [ Snaps fingers ] i'm sorry, miss birnley. No one goes in, he doesn't come out. Mr. Birnley's instructions. There's no sense in pursuing this boy with money ! It means nothing to him ! What else could ? Yes, yes, yes. Put him on, will you ? Women ? He didn't seem to me to be the type. It's often that type that, um-- Very true. If we could just find a friend of his. I mean, someone who knew the best way to talk to him. Father ? What's going on ? What have you been doing to sidney ? [ Birnley ] now, really, daphne, it's no concern of yours. [ Daphne ] i want to know just exactly what you've done to sidney. W-Will you please-- I'm sorry, father-- This is a very important business meeting. Miss birnley, just a minute. Stand by the phone, will you ? I'll ring you back. Um, miss birnley, i take it you know mr. Stratton quite well ? How well ? We're very good friends. Why not ? Why not ? It may be very useful to us. [ Phone rings ] I thought i told you-- [ Man ] mr. Birnley ? Oh, it's for you. Hello ? Sit down, miss birnley. [ Birnley ] no, davidson, i cannot. Miss birnley, We're trying to buy the world rights to mr. Stratton's new discovery. But he doesn't seem to trust us. Doesn't he ? Why not ? Miss birnley, you're the daughter of an industrialist. You must realize how reckless exploitation... Of anything new would upset the delicate balance of trade. You understand that ? I am beginning to. Good. Good. You want to suppress it. But, gentlemen, if you aren't able to persuade him, why should i be able to ? Uh, all men are susceptible, miss birnley. I need hardly tell you that you're a very attractive girl. Thank you. [ Birnley ] tell them i'll see them tomorrow. [ Daphne ] well, michael, what do you say ? It's a desperate situation, daphne, For the whole industry. Yes. Yes, i'm beginning to realize that. [ Cranford ] there's no need to explain what's at stake. When i tell you we've already offered stratton a quarter of a million, You can see for yourself. I can, indeed. But, since we're on the subject of price, what do i get out of it ? - [ Cranford ] miss birnley ! - Daphne ! I haven't had much experience with these sort of things, But i've always understood it was comparatively well paid. Now, miss birnley-- This isn't anything to joke about. I suggest 2,000. Aren't you rating my value a little low ? Wouldn't 5,000 be fairer ? Five thousand. Agreed. Agreed. It's a pleasure to do business with you, sir john. Well, daphne ? And about time too. I want to talk to you, sidney. I never thought you would be on their side. You may not believe me, sidney, but i want what's best for you. I-- I don't like this any more than you do. I hate this town. The mill, everything. People who think of nothing but moneygrubbing. Don't you feel like that ? Yes. I want to get away, sidney. I want to see something of the world beyond this dirty little town. To make a life for myself where there are people who know the way to live. Italy, maybe. France ? Well, why don't you ? I can't. But you could. And you could take me. How ? I know what they offered you. You could live the rest of your life on it. Go anywhere. Do as you please. And if you want me, i'd come too. What's wrong ? I'm sorry. No. Not even if it means me ? No. Thank you, sidney. What for ? If you'd said yes, i'd have strangled you. Now, we've got to get that suit to the newspapers. Show it to them and tell them the whole story. That will blow the lid off everything, and they'll never get it back on. But how ? Would you stake your life on this ? You can issue a categorical denial to the press. The stuff does not exist. It has never been invented. It never could be. There is no panic here whatsoever. Certainly mr. Birnley will confirm that. No, no, no. Good heavens, davidson, I told you to deal with them in your own way. Yes, mr. Birnley. They've come out. On strike. What ? Strike ? [ Davidson ] they've got the whole mill out. I tried to get you on the telephone, but you kept on being engaged. Well, you better get them back at all costs. Otherwise, there'll be a landslide. Landslide ? [ Davidson ] now, mr. Birnley, i-- [ Men arguing ] - Then go and do something ! - They want a guarantee we're not going into production. But, we're not intending to. Good heavens, man, that's what we're out to prevent. Yes, i know. But they won't take one's word for anything. Oh, this is insanity ! They're afraid of being out of work and so they down tools. What am i to do ? - [ Knocking ] - Get them up here. Up to the house. I'll talk to them. [ Chuckles ] well, what are you waiting for ? But what guarantee can we give them ? We don't control the thing. Oh, i don't know. Sir john-- [ Loud crash ] [ Whistling ] It's only a matter of fivepence. You're very unreasonable. Excuse me-- Can you let me have fivepence ? Right. No coppers at all. Well, more would do. I've got three and eleven, but i want four and four. I've got to get to manchester. I could more than pay you back as soon as i've done it. I could give you 100. I've got some money at my digs. Better get it then. Kierlaw or anyone else. And frank'll-- [ Bertha ] it's sid ! Hey ! Wait for me ! Sid ! Sid, i want to talk to you. Can't talk now, gotta find a shilling. Sid, where are you going ? Your room's lent. Where's that vase ? Who are you ? Sid, the room's let to some old geezer. Oh, i beg your pardon. What's going on ? Will you please kindly leave this room ? Oh, sid. Sorry. Sid, i knew you'd turn out right in the end. They tried to soften you up. Oh, you can't tell me. They locked me in the attic. Human life means nothing to 'em, but you got away. I must go now. Don't you worry. They won't get at you again. I'm going up to a meeting there now. Wait till i tell them. What a trump card. Thanks, bertha. But there's a train to manchester at 8:13. Manchester ? What for ? To give it to the newspapers-- The whole story. Here, wait a minute. What story ? The whole thing. My invention and how people tried to stop it. But they're not going to. Sid ! Whose side are you on ? The same as you. Don't you understand ? They want to stop it. So do we. Sid, listen. No, sid. Sid, don't go ! Sid-- Now, look, sid. Sid ! [ Clattering ] [ sid grunts ] [ Sid cries out ] [ clattering ] Will you please stop ? Please, stop. Stop it. Stop it. [ Struggling ] I'll fetch mrs. Watson. Here, you can't do that. That's my room. Open that door. Let me out of here. Let him out of there. Not likely. All right, i'll fetch the police. Hey ! Wait a minute ! [ Grunts ] [ banging continues ] - Let me out ! - [ Banging continues ] Bertha ! What's up ? Harry, stay here. Don't let either of them escape. Eh ? Sid's gone mad. He doesn't know what he's doing. He's got us all muddled up with birnley. [ Sighs ] [ classical ] This is beyond belief, gentlemen. And if sir john was suggesting... What i could hardly believe he could be suggesting-- Now, my dear birnley, [ stammering ] Let your daughter deal with stratton in her own way. After all, she went into it with her eyes open. Well, i didn't. Yes ? The works committee is here. Oh, well-- Well, show them up. N-Now, birnley-- B-Birnley, listen-- [ classical ] [ Daphne ] who is that ? It's me, daddy. Daphne, i-I just wondered if you were still there. Yes, i'm still here. Daphne, i-I want to talk to you. Not now, father. Daphne. [ Cranford ] birnley, don't be ridiculous. But she's locked in. [ Chattering ] Crazy or not, we've got him. We'll get some sense into him. [ Birnley ] daphne ! Open-Open the door, please. Daphne, open this door. Daphne ! No. Knudsen ? Ladies and gentlemen, sir john will now explain to you the situation. We're talking to mr. Birnley. No one else. Mr. Birnley will be along in a few minutes. He better come now. And we'll do the explaining. You see, the boot's on the other foot now. Now that sidney stratton's with us. W-With you ? [ Frank ] that's right. [ Record slows ] sidney's apologies. But, from now on, you'll just have to, um, count him out. [ Dog barking in distance ] - Hello. - Hello. [ Soft knock ] [ Knocking continues ] Who's that ? [ Knocking ] Well, what is it ? You know, there's a man in that room. I know that. Well, he's got out. Eh ? He went that way. All right. Thank you. - Good-Bye. - Here, let me out of here. Let me-- [ Clamoring ] listen ! [ Cranford ] what are we arguing for ? Nobody wants to market it. [ Man ] quite right. My dear friends, You must see that our bone of contention is nonexistent. Capital and labor are hand in hand in this. Once again, as so often in the past, each needs the help of the other. [ Phone ringing ] [ Harry ] mr. Birnley ? Yes ? Can i speak to bertha ? Bertha. Who ? Is somebody called bertha ? Who is it ? It's me, bertha, harry. Harry, you-- I don't know how he did it. There were bars on the window. And the kid said he got out. When i went in, he'd gone ! What ! [ Cranford ] we'll get him at the station ! Michael ! Corland ? Corland, you take your car, i'll take mine. Right ! Frank, you're not going with them. They're not going without me. They're not going to take me for a ride. [ Sir john ] wait for me. Wait. [ Sir john wheezing ] wait. Wait. Okay, ducks. Room for one more inside. [ Grunting ] [ engine starts ] [ Train whistle blowing ] - [ Tires screech ] - [ Frank ] there he is ! There. [ Cranford ] all right, boys, get after him. The other way ! Cut him off ! [ Tires screech ] [ train approaching ] There ! Come on, lads. There's a light bobbing up and down over there. That's not a light, it's sid. [ Man ] there he is ! [ Tires screech ] Well, cheerio, alf. [ Man ] there he is ! After him, lads. Come on. After him ! Hey ! What's the matter ? Dad ! What've you been doing ? Nothing. Hello. That way. Here, don't you know there's a strike on ? Now, listen, there'll only be trouble if you stay here. It's the stability. It isn't stable. Mrs. Watson, have you got something ? My suit, they can see me. Why can't you scientists leave things alone ? What about my bit of washing when there's no washing to do ? [ Dog barking in distance ] [ Man ] there he is, lads ! There he is. - There ! - [ Man #2 ] there he is. - [ Car door closes ] - [ Man #3 ] all right, lads. We got him. [ Laughing ] - [ Laughter continues ] - The work, it's coming to pieces ! We're saved ! [ Laughter increases ] Look ! Look ! Sir john ! Sir john ! [ Laughter continues ] [ Man ] look ! Look ! [ Crowd chattering ] [ man ] look, it's funny. Look ! [ Laughter, chattering stops ] Here, lad, wear this. [ Birnley narrating ] the crisis is over now. The news of sidney's failure brought relief to the world. I see. It had been a hard and bitter experience for all of us. But we faced the future with confidence. We have seen the last of sidney stratton. I see. [ Birnley ] at least, i hope we've seen the last of him.
