There's too many pressure ridges that way. It'll take us half a day just to get to the water. I say we just go down pass the runway, man. No, no, dude. There's cracks over there. - Who told you that? - My dad. - He was out there last week. - What? You scared? No. I just don't feel like swimming back if the wind kicks up. I'm gonna catch me a bunch of natchiq. What? With that piece of shit Man, my 30 aught 6 is gonna waste your brand-new 308, muthafuckah! On a mission my dinner's old. Pushin' a peddle, man, I'm ridin' a load. Tryin' to keep my eyes on the road. While I feel a bite from the cold. - ha-ha. What's that? - Man, that's "yesking". What kind of bitch ass rhyme is that, dude? Fuck you. That's the rhyme. What you wanna bet? If I'm right, you can send that fine ass girl of yours over and she can ride my usiq - like she's been wanting to. - Fuck you, man. Got your tunes? Oh, yeah. Ha. Have her come over to my place tonight. Give me time to finish off my girl first though. Unless she wants to have a threesome. How does she like it? She like to ride or be ridden? You're only saying that 'cause I already had your girl, man. I had your girl and dumped her skanky ass. I guess you like 'em skanky though, huh? With that skanky ass mom of yours... - hey.

Finally got the rest of our lumber. We can finish our shed this weekend. - We were gonna go out. - Where? Out on the ice. - Which way? - Down past the runway. Just you two? James is probably gonna come, too. - Hi, daddy. - Hey, ballerina. - ahh! - Ya, ya, ya. Hi, Aivaaq. How's your mom? - She's okay. - Is that tutu? The one he shot last fall. Last little bit of it. They're going out this weekend though, bring home some natchiq for the freezer. - Where are you going? - Just out. Don't stay out too late. All right. Go see your grandma first. I couldn't check on her today. Okay. Hey, Qalli. Hey, Aivaaq. My mom told me not to talk to strange girls. - What's up? - Don't talk to 'em, Qalli. They'll get you into trouble. You guys here about that party at Roscoe's? - What? - Yeah. His parents are out of town or something. Is that where you guys are going right now? - Yeah. - You guys want a ride? - Could we get Uvlu first? - Sure. - Where's James? - He's already there. He send you guys to look for us? No. So you guys came looking for us yourselves? I see how it is. - Dude. - As if. Don't worry, Michelle. Your secret's safe. I won't tell James. - hey, what's up, man? - 'Sup, homes? Hello. Hey, girl. Where you been? I've been waiting for you. Yeah, I can see that. - Hey, Ellie. - 'Sup, cuz? You've been caught, fool. Let's get you guys some drinks. That's what I'm talking about. Fuck you, guys! Fuck you, guys! Fuck you, guys! Fuck you! Oh! Hey, Qalli! Qalli, get over here, bro! - "Bump that arctic thug." - All right. All right. All right. Top of the world. Let's show 'em how we par-ty. Me and my man Qalli came out with this beat. Get it started! There we go. Yeah. Professional eskimo, gangster in the snow. Aught-six, 3 clips. Drop you like the temperature well below zero, frostbite on your nose. Misigaq is my flow. In the boat, rock it fast then slow. On the drums, keep the beat keep it slow. Northern lights up above, green as bud, show some love for these arctic thugs. Hollah! Ooo... Wee! Throw your hands up. Yeah! Woo! You ain't gotta worry about a thing. I'll provide. You gotta learn hot to cut a seal though. I'm gonna be a hunter. Ain't that right, Qalli? If you don't graduate and get a job, then how's the big, bad hunter gonna buy gas and bullets? I'm old school. Well, I'm new school. I'm not changing no fox-skin diapers so your ass is getting a job. All right, man. I'm gonna roll out. So soon? I promised my dad I'd go see my grandma. I'll see you in the morning? I'll have coffee waiting for you. Kick ass earlier. I'm going to see what's up, dude. You're gonna be waiting a long time. What? The sun doesn't set 'til august. Thanks for the info. I would have been out here all night if it wasn't for you. You're leaving early? I gotta go see my grandma. You're not drunk, are you? Your grandma would kick your ass. I only had one. Where are you heading? Home. I've seen enough. Did you and James fight? My bad. None of my business. Sorry. It's all right. I loved the song earlier. Yeah. Aivaaq was pretty good. So are you. Thanks. Well, goodnight. Goodnight. Grandma? I was just at my friends. I didn't know if you'd still be awake. Now don't take too much. Ah, yeah. ...that's the best thing. Like right now, you would be out hunting somewhere trying to get a natchiq for me. If you're hooked to these, you'll never be a good hunter. Never, ever. I guess. - It's high-low. - Okay. Ah-la. Highs, zero to 10 below. Lows tomorrow evening around 20 below. And west winds, He left already, with James. Said you could catch up. All right. Thanks. What you guys do last night? Nothing. Crazy. Motherfucker! Hey! Knock it off! Chill out! Chill out, man! Quit fighting! No more fighting! - Knock it off! - Motherfucker! Yah! Ah. Is he dead? - Yeah. - Ah... He fucking hit me with the shovel. Fucking James. Dumb-ass motherfucker! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What the hell happened? - He went crazy. - Why were you guys fighting? He was too drunk so I was driving. Hit an ice chunk, we tripped and he got pissed. - So he was drunk? - Yeah. - What about you? - I didn't even drink that much. This is his. I don't... Fucking James. Why were you smoking that stuff? I was drunk. I was just trying it. Where the fuck did you go last night? I had to go see my grandma. Who the hell leaves a party to see their grandma? What am I gonna do? They're gonna lock me up. They're gonna ship me south. I'm never gonna see my kid. Uvlu's gonna freak. W... we could tell him what happened. What, man?! I got fucking high and murdered him?! You didn't murder him. That's my knife, man! I can't go back! Nah, man. If I go back, they're gonna lock me up! - I can't go back! - Just calm down, man! - You're still high! - Don't tell me to calm down! Look at him! His blood is everywhere! Fucking James, you piece of shit! Ahhh! - Let me go! - No! I'm not going back! Just leave the rifle and go. No. What if we don't take him back? That's messed up. It's better than your idea. Hey, wait. Don't get bloody. Let's lift the legs. One, two, three. Let's turn him over. Listen, man, what happened back there, I still gotta tell you about it. What do we do with this? I don't know. We should've tied it to him. No, no, we can't go back now, man, too many tracks. Hey, isn't it past your bedtime boys? I think I heard your momma calling. Ha, ha, ha. What is it, son? I... it's James. He fell through the ice. Warm up the machines. Start calling the guys. Get everybody over here. I need a satellite picture of the ice conditions. Tell me what happened. Me and James went out this morning. - Where were you? - We left early. I... I think he was drunk. He was driving really fast. - What trail were you on? - Down past the runway. Ten or 11 miles. We hit some fog. There was a crack and... James couldn't see it. I jumped off and... He didn't. Call price at the runway. Get the chopper up. How much gas do you have in your tank? - About half. - You take us out there. As soon as we leave, get a hold of his family, and don't let jimmy follow. Let's go. Is this where he went in? What do you think? Look like the current's moving north, north east. Two miles an hour, light slush. Rescue bird, this is rescue ground. Go ahead, rescue ground. Current's heading north, north east. Start the search on my position. Check the lead for two miles north of here. Roger that. Rescue ground, this is rescue bird. Go ahead, rescue bird. It looks like the wind is pushing that ice back in your direction. I think you guys should pull back to shore. - I gotta find my boy! - Calm down! - Where's my son?! - Jimmy! What are you guys doing back so early, huh? The ice is moving! We can't be out there! - Ah, bullshit! - Go home! Your wife needs you! My son needs me out there, you cowards! I'm gonna go find my son! And you... where is he?! What'd you guys do with him?! Huh?! my boy! Where is he, huh?! - Hey, man, calm down! - I need to find my boy! - Where's my sonny boy?! - Get the hell outta here! Where's my son?! Where's my sonny boy, huh?! - calm down! - Where's my sonny boy, huh?! My sonny?! What's the ice like? Moving. Winds are pushing it. The lead is all closed up. If they shift by tomorrow, we'll go out again. I'll go in the morning. No, son. I know you wanna help your friend, but you'd be a distraction. Did you see James go in? Egasak. No. So when you got there, it was just Aivaaq? Just him alone... standing by the water. I need you boys to let me know what happened yesterday. We were going hunting. We hit some fog and didn't see the crack. Was James driving? I jumped off. Did you see this? What happened to your eye? When I jumped off, I hit a piece of ice. Was alcohol involved? We were at a party the night before. Were you there, too? I'm disappointed in you two. You want to end up like your father? No. Well, that's the path you're on with this shit. I watched him drink himself to death before he was 30. I sure as hell don't want to watch his son go down the same road. You understand? And you... I thought you knew better. You're gonna disappoint a lot of people if you get caught up in this. Sign down here. Where have you been? I've been calling you. Sorry. I heard, man. That's messed up. Yeah, I can't believe it. Come on. Everyone's at Michelle's. - Can you all leave? - What? Please, I need to be alone. Wait. I want to talk to you and Aivaaq. All right. She wants to talk to us. I think she has some questions. Shit. Is he really dead? - You were with him at Roscoe's. - Yeah. Did he seem... okay? I guess. - What do you mean "I guess"? - He got kinda drunk. - Just drunk? - Yeah, just drunk! - Well, what was he saying? - About what?! He wasn't talking about anything? - He was just partying! - Hey dude, chill out. - She's like the fucking police. - I just wanna know! I didn't make him get drunk. How come you didn't stay with him? I can't take anymore of these questions. I broke up with him at the party. Finally, right? I was so sick of his shit, hitting on 15-year-old girls. I didn't think he would care, but he was pissed. I thought he was gonna cry even. And he kept telling me that he would make me regret it. But I didn't care... Except that I can't stop thinking about it now. Like you said, it was an accident. But what if it wasn't an accident? It was. James... James wouldn't do that. He wouldn't just drive into the fog. I tried to break up with him last year... and... he... he really scared me. And now everyone thinks that we're still together, and they don't know that I broke up with him. And you... you can't say anything. Why? Because they're gonna think that it's my fault. - It wasn't your fault. - You don't know that. I know. I... I know it wasn't your fault. How do you know? I... I just do. He wouldn't stop drinking that flask. Where are your parents? My dad's out there searching. And my mom's not here. I told her. What? That I killed him. How can you do this? We're going to have a baby together, Aivaaq. I didn't mean to. I'm sorry. - That's enough. - Babe. - That's enough. - Babe, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Hey... I'm sorry. Hey, babe. I'm sorry. I got him. - Hey. I gotta talk to you. - Hey, shut up. - I wanted... - Hey. - Uvlu? Uvlu?! - Hey, let's go! - Uvlu?! hey! - Come on, let's go! Hey. Mom. - Is he drunk? - Yeah. Poor baby. Bring him in. I love you, mom. I got drunk. I'm sorry. Why'd you let him drink so much? Qalli, come here, bro. - I love you. - Yeah, I know. I fucked up everything. dude, shut up. He thought he was gonna kick my ass? Shh. Like I was gonna let him do that?! Sit down. Fu... he was a real asshole. Shh! I had to go crazy on him. - I had to. - Shut up. Cold killah, I'll stick it in ya. Quiet. I did it. I really did. What did he just say? I'm sorry, mom. I had to kill him. Get out! Don't listen to him. He's just drunk. Go home now! Qalli! You have to help him. You can't let him get caught. He loves you so much. - Where the hell have you been? - Calm down. Well? I was at Michelle's with Uvlu and Aivaaq. Why didn't you call us? Did you guys find anything? No. Winds turned bad. We had to call it off. I'm sorry. Are you drunk? I've been out all day looking for the body of your friend - and you go get drunk. - I'm not drunk. - You sure smell like it. - That was Aivaaq. Why the hell is Aivaaq partying while his friend is still missing? He feels bad. So Aivaaq is drinking but not you?! - No. - Goddammit! What's going on, son? You need to talk to us. You're gonna sit your ass down and tell us! You're not helping! I'm gonna get to the bottom of this! - Sit down! - Egasak! What did you see out there? Nothing. He... he already fell in. Something happened. I went back down the trail today. There's a spot where the tracks are messed up, like someone dug up the snow. He didn't say anything? N... no. I... I... I think they might've still been drunk. - Were you? - No. I went to go see grandma that night. - Ask her. - Go to bed. Now! - They just lost their friend. - I know. His snow machine was there. His tracks are there. They stopped and something happened. There's a spot where the snow was brushed over, like trying to erase it. Your job was to find James. That's it. Don't you tell me what my job is. Our son is going to college in four months. You're search and rescue. You did your search. It's over. If it was our son dead, you wouldn't say that. Fucking bolt's stripped. You remember? I don't think they'll say anything, but you gotta quit drinking. Can't stop thinking about it. When we tied him down, his eyes were open. That won't help. It doesn't even seem real. I remember pulling the knife... After that, everything was just so quick. I mean, he was my friend, man. Maybe you were right. We should've brought him back. What about Uvlu? Your kid? I can't even look at her right now. Everybody's so fucking freaked. They think he drowned. Everybody keeps asking me, man, what happened? What happened? Aivaaq. Aivaaq. What happened? Aivaaq. It's driving me crazy. Seeing his mom, I just started shaking. That day on the ice, I thought his dad was gonna fucking kill me. I just want this to be over. We gotta go to the singspiration tonight. No way. - It's what's expected. - I'm not going to his house. Dude, we have to. I'm not going. Fuck that. Hey, listen. You can spend the rest of your life making up for this. You just got to raise your kid right. What the fuck do you care? - You're leaving soon. - What? Couple months, right? Dude, I'm not leaving. You're stupid to stick around here after what we did. If I was you, I would leave. Well, I'm not. What, you think with James gone, you're just gonna hook up with michelle like you always wanted to? Like, nothing happened? Holy shit. You did, huh? That's why you followed her down the hall the other night. I guess I did you a fucking favor. Nathaniel, I wake you up? No. We're all done. Tell them to bring everything in. I'll be there in a few minutes. Oh, fuck. Dad? Where are you? I need to talk to you. It's about James. No, no, no. I don't want to do it over the phone. Can you come home? I'm at Aivaaq's. I'll meet you back home? Qalli? Hi. What are you doing? Just walking. What are you doing? Nothing. What's that? It's just some oil. I was working on my machine. Over here? At Aivaaq's. He had my tools. Oh. You, ah... going to singspiration tonight? I was gonna come by to see you. What? No. No! They can't find out what we did. - You can't say anything! - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. It's like, I'm his widow. Everyone comes up to me and hugs me and says all this shit. Michelle, it wasn't your fault. How do you know? You weren't there. You didn't see it. Just leave me alone. I've been waiting. Sorry. What did you want to tell me? Spit it out. It's about James. He was with Michelle the night before. Michelle Ukpik? They were together, right? So? I... I heard they broke up. Yeah? And he got real mad. Where'd you hear this? Son?! Michelle told me. She was crying. She said... she said she thinks maybe he did it on purpose. She told me not to tell anyone. Why tell me? You told me to tell you everything. Maybe I shouldn't have. No. You have to talk about it. Don't tell anyone else, though. It'll just bring more pain to his family. You did the right thing, son. You know, he loved you guys. You guys were like brothers to him. I'm sorry for getting mad at you over at the beach. I'm just glad you came, okay? It's not your fault. All right? - It's not your fault. - Sorry. Yeah. - Amen. - Amen. Grandma? Mmm-hmm? Can I sleep over tonight? - Grandma? - Mmm-hmm? My friend... He got killed. Oh, dear. Have you guys seen Aivaaq? No. We seen him earlier at the Arctic pizza though. All right. Thanks. Have you seen Aivaaq? He was here last night. What did he say? He's an asshole. He broke up with me. He said that my baby probably wasn't his. He said it was James. Is that why he did it? No, no, no. What happened out there was an accident. - Then why would he say that? - I don't know. He's just freaking out right now. So am I! - Well, I gotta go find him. - Qalli? It's his. I know. Qalli, what's up? You need to control your boy here. Come on, let's go. You best listen, bitch. - Saddle up and ride away. - Hey, shut the fuck up. Chill, man. We want the same thing here. You ever give him anything, Sell to him, I'm gonna turn your ass in. That's a fucked up thing to say. - I ain't scared. - Good for you. This kinnaq here has a problem keeping his mouth shut. You ever turn me in, I guess I have a few things to say to the cops as well. Get the fuck away from my house. What the hell are you doing here? Leave me alone, man. I thought you said you were done with that shit, man? - What about your kid? - What about it? - I talked to Uvlu. - It's probably not even mine. - Get the hell out of my way. - You know that's bullshit. - Get the hell out of my way! - You ever come her again... what? What the fuck are you gonna do about it? What're you gonna do? Ugh! Ugh! Chill out, man! You didn't do it! You didn't kill him! I did! H... he hit you with the shovel... You went down and... Oh, man. He... he... he was gonna hit you again. So... so I tackled him. I don't know, man. I... I guess I had your knife in my hand and... After... after you got up... You... you thought that you... I'm sorry, bro. Where's your rifle? It's in the shed. Is it clean? I think so. You didn't fire it? Oh, ah, I did. When we were out there, I saw someone and I just tried to get their attention so I shot. I guess I just forgot to clean it. It's okay. I'll clean it. If the weather holds, I think I'll go out tomorrow, bring home some natchiq for the freezer. I want you to come, too. I can't. Yes you can. Dad. What's been going on with you? You have to talk to me, son... No mater what it is. Aivaaq can come, too. We'll swing by and pick him up in the morning. We'll stop here for lunch. Bring that grub box up and help him. Let me see your rifle. Kept that in good shape. You know that used to be mine? It was my dad's. Yeah. Before that it was mine. He won it for me. - Really? - Yeah. We used to run dog teams a long time ago, on trap lines. We were maybe 15 or 16. My dogs were always faster than his, and I sure used to let him know it. So one time he challenged me to a race, I thought there was no way I could lose, so I bet him my rifle. He ran the race in front of maybe half the town one morning, and my god-damn dogs were the slowest I've ever seen 'em... he won by a mile. I found out later he snuck over to my house with some walrus meat that morning. Fed it to 'em till they were about to pass out. Holy shit, was I mad at him. He never did give me a rematch though. I'll race you for it. Let's go up on that ridge and see far open water is. Now you're gonna tell me what happened?! - What did you get my son into?! - I didn't mean to! - What did you do?! - I didn't! You lied! There's a knife wound in his neck! - What did you do?! - Dad, it was me! What? I killed him. It... it was an accident. Why didn't you tell me? We... we were scared. I'm sorry. Oh, son... Take the battery from the boat... It should be heavy enough. Tie it to him real good. I can't tell you what kind of person to be. It's your decision. I thought he'd look different. Where are you going? To get my machine so we can take him back. Get away from him! What are you doing? I'm serious. Get away from him! We can't keep lying. I'm done doing it your way, Qalli. - Don't... don't do this. - Shut up! Move over there! - Put it around your feet. - No. I'll do it! Throw it back! Put your hands behind you! Aivaaq. Hey, look at me, man! You don't want to do this. Why didn't you tell me? Man... You... you smoke that stuff and you... you just screwed up our lives. Yeah, I did. Well, we can't leave him back here again. It's not gonna work. - I know. - All right. So me and you... We can take him back and just tell them the truth. You know, I killed him. No. Hey! What... what are you doing?! I'm bringing him back. No, you didn't kill him. I did. You said it yourself. I got high. I started the fight. I pulled my knife. He's not dead because of you, it's because of me. If you go down for this, I'm finished. I... i'm not gonna let you get away with this! I'm gonna tell! Who do you think they're gonna listen to this time? Even now your dad's still gonna believe me. Aivaaq, no! All this time you're going around telling lies and making shit up. I thought you were doing it to protect me. You're not such a fucking saint. I'm not.
