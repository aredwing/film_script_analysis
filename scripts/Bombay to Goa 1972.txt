Good and bad folk are found in evey profession. ln business, society, government. lt depends on what kind of person you come across. Think before condemning others. To become an actress you had become blind. And what kind ofa man you associated with. l've made all the inquiries. She's a golden goose. Her name is Mala. Father... Drinks water from a silver glass and eats ofl a golden plate. And the girl dreams of becoming an actress day and night. Ourjob is done. Let us also eat and drink in gold and silver.

So you're looking for new faces? l'd love to act in fllms. l've won many cups for acting on school and college stage. ll you give me a chance in your fllm? Sure. You need us and we need you. The photograph should be true to life. lfthese drops ofwater slip ofl her body, the picture will be good. Stand like this. Smile and pose. Who are you? - Forget me. Someday l am sure you will become a great fllm star. To reach you then, l'll have to be born again. Sowhy don't l take your autograph now? Write something with your delicate hands in my book. Don't interFere in somebody's personal matters. You take the picture and you get out ofthe frame. l wasn't born to get out. - ll you go quietly...? Look, l neither came because you asked norwill l leave. l think he's decided he wants to get thrashed. You come here. Smile a little. Just a minute! Wait! What's going on? Let her be. Look at it this way. You want a heroine. You're also getting a hero. Just hold this. l think l'll have to stop being nice. l turned one into aflsh. What do you want, love? - l don't talk to riflrafl, love. Listen to me. God gives beauty but we must protect it. Take evey step in youth aer great contemplation. Up to you whetheryou listen or not.

You've given her so much liberty that she's getting spoilt! She's our only child. Must be partying with friends. No! Now her parties should be stopped She must come home before 7! Find her a good boy as soon as possible and get her married. lt's better you put chains in my feet! l won't be able to go anywhere! Your mother is getting mad at me since then. How did you get so late? - College closes at 5.30. A professor had come from the American University at 6. l had to stay to hear his lecture. lt was 8 when he flnished. Then l went to Rita's house. She forced me to have tea. An hourwent by there. We were 4 friends. Ritaflrst dropped them, then dropped me. But Daddy, Mummy is always scolding me. lfyou've given me an education, Iet me be responsible for myself. That's right. Mala's mother don't say anything about my child. l will! A hundred times! We live in an old fashioned colony. People talk when you return so late. Would you like me to stop going to college? l'll stay at home and sweep the house or knead dough! Of course not. She agrees. Fight terminated. Have dinner. - l don't want it. Don't eat but now on l won't tolerate you being out so late! When you've tolerated a man like me for 25 years... Tolerate her little habit too. Eveything is ajoke foryou! Your mother scolded you not me. She says don't eat dinner. But you may eat my share. Why hasn't Mala come as yet? - Because she's a latecomer! You're pretty late. Yes? - What crap is this? Here's your money. Why are you turning into my enemy? - Enemy? But l want to be friends. l'm vey sory if you think it's hatred. Thanks to you, Usha lyer got angy and le!

One is atall jet, the otherJumbo. l hope you aren't hurt. - Not at all. Had the manager not interrupted, l'd show him! Sharma dealt in elephant tusks in East Africa. He nevertouched a dead elephant's tusks. He'd go to the jungle, pounce on live elephants and pull their tusks! What are you saying? Today you are late. So it's not right to stay long. Take this card and come to our oMce tomorrow evening. l'm taking her to buy costumes and make up. We have a trial tomorrow. - First ask her. Has she decided to be a heroine? That's right. So what do you say? Do you have to ask? l can't believe it! Can l really be a heroine? Listen to her! What is this? These days girls with brinjal noses become heroines. Then why can't you? Features like yours... She doesn't have them, right? You're right. Do one thing. We're going shopping. Ask the cashier for 2000 bucks. Have you forgotten? The cashier has taken the day ofl. What a shame! And tomorrow is Sunday. The shops will be shut. We'll have to wait. -Why? l'll pay it. - Good. She's become our company partner on the flrst day.

Our cameraman, make up man, dress man...all are your fans. As they keep praising you, my problems are mounting. lt's diMcult to pair a hero with a girl as pretty as you. l can't flnd anybody who'll Iook great with you. Why don't you talk to afamous hero? That's what even l wanted. But there's one problem. - What problem? l've wound up my business in Africa. But my money is still there. Taking an established star will hike up the budget. l want to tell you something. - What? lt might rankle. But l don't consider you a stranger now. lfyou arrange for a lakh ortwo... We can make a good proposal. Yes, that's right. A big name will add credit to her name too. We'll make fast business. - Right. But you don't think too much.

You could have burnt this house! Flames would rise! Why did you have to play with my honour! What's wrong in this? - What's le? What will our community say on seeing these dirty pictures? The pictures you think are dirty have some value for the world. There is art and talent in it. Shamelessness is never art. The family you'll get married into is vey cultured and reputed. They won't see these pictures from the art point of view. lfthey are illiterate, travel in carts when man has gone to the moon... lt's not my fault. l've nothing to do with them. l want you to know my decision. l'm not ready for marriage. l want to become afllm star. What? You want to become a fllm star! Now l know why you came home late evey night. You've fooled your parents! This program and that... ls this the destination ofdecent daughters?

You'll be married next month. Go away! This is why l've come to consult you on the sly. Tell me, what l must do. You're putting a great responsibility on me. When you trust me so much, l'll support you at evey stage. For the time being there is only one solution for you. Collect whatever money you can from home and come to me. Run away from home? Leave my parents? You can't achieve success without sacriflce. You say something. -What can l say? On one hand the goddess offame stands open armed to embrace you. On the other hand, the poisonous snake of marriage wants to crush you. You yourself are sensible. Take a decision. But mind you, this opportunity won't come again. Come in. She has come. Finally the sun rose at night. Here's the cash. - Did you count it? l brought whatever l laid hands on, out offear. Must be more than a lakh. We'll also prove to be more than your expectation. You sit comfortably, wipe the sweat beads. No point in worying about what you've given up. l'll put this in place. Look aer her. - Got it. Listen... Did you say something? - Tell Sharma to hury up. l'll do that. Have a drink. Well done! What a haul! Here's your share. Your share. - Thanks, boss. l've given her the drink. - Come.

What's wrong? - 2 bundles won't satis me. l want equal share. Equal share? - Yes. Don't forget l cut the wings ofthe bird who brought this. Trapping Mala wasn't your cup oftea. Quietly give me halfofthis. And ifl don't? Then you are aware ofthe punishment for inciting an innocent girl... To steal and tempting her with false film oers. So you've thought of ways to get me arrested. Yes. - You probably don't know... The tongue that rises against me... lt is locked forever. Let's go. Let him be! It's between us. Why flght for a petty thing? Come and take whatever you want. What's the matter? Did somebody stab you? Nothing. Just a nightmare. You dream in the day and scream. Passengers have tender hearts too. What if somebody suflered a stroke? This girl's scream has subdued all the passengers. You sing so well. Sing for us. Sing that song... Sit down. - l'll listen to that song. Go to Calcutta and hear it from Pankaj Mallick. No, sing that... Bald Tansen, sit in your place. Calm down. l'll sing a new song. You wouldn't have heard it.
