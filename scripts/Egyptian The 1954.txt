And that, most of all ancient civilizations of the earth was full of darkness and mystery. These monuments powerful tell of a people, that once ruled the world. The creators of a civilization never surpassed in beauty and splendor. But the Egyptians were not only builders of monuments ... were also humans and no little different from us. This is the story of a man who lived in ancient Land of the Nile. Thirty-three centuries. I, Sinuhe the Egyptian I write this ... in my place of exile, the shores of the Red Sea. There is on earth, a place more desolate. Soon the jackals and the vultures make a poor meal what's left of me. No monument marks my place of rest. Just leave it: The story of my life. I have lived fully and deeply. I experienced the passion, sin and even murder. Is that you must judge me. Have to weigh, good versus evil, passion against tenderness, crime against charity, pleasure against pain. I started life as and I'm done: himself. Sailed alone in the heart of the Nile ... in a boat of reeds and tar and tied with us as a hunter. It was thus used to Thebes get rid of their unwanted children. I grew up on the seafront of the city ... the house of my parents, I had rescued from river. My father had lived there by choice ... because he was also by choice, doctor of the poor of the city. The rich he could get high fees ... Because at Thebes he was the only master in the ancient art of head open. Prepare a little more wine with medicine. Afraid, Sinuhe? Good It should never fear death. In our office, death is a usual companion. But this time we deceive. Look. This tiny sliver of bone is pressing the brain. When removing it, he will speak again. walk and live. Why father? Why? Nobody knows. From the beginning he avoided entire company. I used to wander alone the Nile ... Until the day came entering the School of Life At the School of Life ... young people were trained chosen from Egypt. Future scientists and philosophers, statesmen and generals. All learning of Egypt, was based on the custody of the Gods. For ten years, to serve them in school and won the right being called a doctor. I learned to bend my body before them that was all. My mind still was the question: Why? Sinuhe ... care, the priests! The health of our colleague school Horemheb The best fencer, the best rider ... the athlete faster and the strongest fighter. and also the first to say that. If you speak well of yourself, nobody will do it for you. I learned this from the Gods. They drank for who I am, now drink so I will be. For the day will come that will bear Whip Golden and you all will lead to war. Hey, is not drinking, my friend. - Wine! - He's had enough. Never enough for friends. He finishes the night in some gutter with his throat cut. You are under my protection. When your future! Look at the doctor's brilliant! This disease of dizziness. Can I help you? The same as always. Do not throw things at my friend! It's alive! Who is he? A stubborn fool, but is my best friend. So take him home. A maid in a tavern does not give orders the son of Falcon. The son of a manufacturer of cheese! Take it home! Good evening, doctor! Your friend is a fool, not you. Why does not anyone answer me when I ask "why"? Come, let us How did she know that your father was a manufacturer of cheese? The queen of cities, Thebes of the hundred gates ... capital of the world. After my graduation School of Life established myself as doctor on the coast ... away from the house of my father ... so as not to steal his patients. But I found that even the poorest of patients ... come to port a doctor so young. I had to go into the streets, look for them. It's too late for that. Come here in the shade. Here, sit down! Can I help you. In some cases blindness can be cured with a needle. No doctor can catch my eye. My first love started when I drank a pitcher of beer, and the filling of a new way that displeased him. And what is your problem? Nothing, I'm as strong as My name is Kaptah, and decided to be his servant. Even if I needed one, could not pay, and even that could not be a ragged beggar. Can be ragged, but I'm smart. I am strong and friendly ... know and read. You are absolutely right, I am a poor set up. But it is a poor doctor and not find anything better. Obey their orders ... can beat me when there is a reason ... in return I will steal from you, when there is a reason too. Then admits he is a thief? We are all thieves. Only rogue deny it. I will improve your reputation. People will say: "Should be a good doctor since they can afford a servant " With an eye? Everyone will say: "Must be a bad doctor since it did not heal his own creation " I will say that when I bought me was totally blind, and recovered half of my vision. Love you! Love you! Love, love! Master, come quick! Come quick! Look! It's your chance! I told him he would make his reputation. Come on everybody! Come here and watch! Summer wonders what his eyes ever beheld. The Gods in person, taught his art my master. He knows the ancient spells and and potions of our ancestors. Come and watch! Someone bring water. Here's the water. Dampen a cloth and press it between his lips. I need to fire purify my instruments. Fire, bring fire to the worker of miracles! The fire is not required. Is dead. Watch wisdom and the piety of my love! In order that this poor soul, is not forced to limp to the rest of your life with one foot ... My master gave him the gift of death. Nobody could have saved him. Save it? For what? Then the young doctor is still asking "why"? Amo ... this is a dangerous woman. Dangerous? See in your eyes, look the ewe for you ... your ram ... Watch your eyes, love, her mind only thinks about ... to break the jar with you, in marriage. Not even know your name. His name was Merit.Era an employee of the tavern ... who could not read or write. She loved me for life ... but just discovered this ... when it was too late. People of Thebes! Ask for mercy to the gods. The pharaoh is dead. They are whining all night. Do these fools think that Pharaoh can bring back? Why not take home? Is dawning. What's wrong with him? Denied his appointment guard at the palace ... because of its offspring. No need to download the voice, about what they are talking about. Yes, I was refused. Refused because of my offspring. And look at those who were admitted! idiots affected and perfumed carrying umbrellas and sing like birds. How long until dawn? An hour, maybe. Have you ever hunted lions? No. I saw a male mane of black, drinking in a pool yesterday. But if he never hunted lions ... He is under my protection, I told you this before. I do not need protection. I myself will bring you to the Skin a lion when he comes. Suppose the lion bring your skin ... What happens to me? Find another love to steal, who has more money. Sinuhe, please be careful. To pay for our spending. That you will be favored. So come on, before it changes your mind! That's how I lost my eye, hunting lions. That son of a manufacturer of cheese ...... Why not rushed, crazy? Was almost dead! Be quiet. God is coming. What is he talking about? He said that God is coming. Which god? He's coming. Aton! Aton? Look! He worships the face of the sun. Thy dawning is beautiful the horizon of heaven. Oh, faithful Aton beginning life ... What's wrong with him? He is with the sacred disease. At least I can avoid he bite his tongue. We can not leave it here .. we will take you to the city. Arrest them! What's wrong? What did we do? Will know in time. Put the chains on them. For two days we were held without knowing the reason for arrest. Finally, escorted us to the royal palace. Silence. Knees. Our new Pharaoh is coming! On his knees before the living God. That which we call Pharaoh is the fool ... We will lose our heads about it. Princess, come here ... Mighty Pharaoh king of Lower and Upper Egypt ... Princess! Look, Dad. Silence, his father is busy. But I want him to see my new monkey. Not now, daughter. Sit back, princess. Mighty Pharaoh king of Lower and Upper Egypt. Son of the Sun It has legs. Stand up. Tickle me more, if any arise. My heart is grieving, because of the death of my father. Let's finish our business, as soon as possible. The Embassies and Hati Kush ... hereby presents respects to new Pharaoh. - They bring gifts ... - Later. I want to see the two prisoners who spoke. Here? Yes, your majesty. Gather round ... Kneeling! Stand! Why do these men have been arrested without trial? Their crime is a sacrilege, majesty ... They put their hands in sacred person of Pharaoh. Sinuhe, a physician, Semut son. Horemheb, the son of a manufacturer of cheese. Gather round. For a manufacturer of cheese he has to look bold. the other, the doctor ... note in their faces. He is the son of Semut? I heard of his work among the poor. Come closer. He must die: put his hands on the Lord. I know. Was to help me. The law makes no such distinction, your majesty! I have the power to change the law? There is no limit to the power of the Pharaoh! The law is changed! I name my doctor's palace. I am deeply grateful but I can not accept such an honor. Why not? I swore to serve the poor. Because of his father? By him and other reasons. Semut not my real father. My real parents are have been very poor ... because when baby was found in a boat reed on the Nile And never knew who his parents were? Maybe they were bird hunters. The boat was moored with us hunters of birds, We as a hunter? Told us Hunter? Yes! Why do you ask, Mom? Curiosity, my son. You can honor its promise Sinuhe and serve the poor. But with the condition that they commit to come to the palace ... Whenever I, or my family we need you. Thank you, Your Majesty! This is not another healer, the son of a manufacturer of cheese. He desecrated the Pharaoh with his touch. Majesty, may I speak? Contact. Horemheb saved his life killing the lion. What is your wish? Leave my drink the blood sword enemies of the Pharaoh ... as my arrows drunk the blood of the lion. Is predicted in my destiny. So is the fate of Egypt be written with blood? It was ever thus. While the war there blood must flow. What is your request? An appointment, your majesty, as an officer of his guard. Your request is granted! I wish he asked to be Our cheesemaker. Princess! I wish he was. The sun is setting. I beg everyone. I will return to my meditations. Come, my daughters. My lord, Princess Baketamon requests your presence. Follow me. You do not. Around here, my lord. Come in, doctor. My mother wants to talk. He will not hurt you. A little more beer. Come closer. So, I never knew Who were his parents? Certainly tried to find them. Contact. I'm happy with the parents who have, your majesty. What year was left to drift? The same year he was born Pharaoh I was told. Why your majesty ... Not here to ask. My mother wants to examine. I know I'm dying wonder how long it will take. Do not be shy. Once enjoyed touch touch the hand of a man. Long time ago! Why stop, doctor? To wonder like a queen braid a mat of reeds? We are hunting birds. I did not know that my family was bird hunters in the Lower Kingdom? And I got an eagle on my network ... The Pharaoh himself. He loved me, Sinuhe because I was strong and vigorous ... because I was vulgar and uneducated, and told her the truth. His other wives, well born and delicate ... have narrow minds. How they hated me. So I swore to give him a son, to use the Double Crown. And gave. But the gods were wicked They gave me a son so sweet as a woman, and a daughter as hard as a man. Baketamon should be the pharaoh ... not his brother. Well, what he found? If your majesty to apologize ... Tell the truth. If you want to live longer ... must stop this strong drink. What insolence. I drank before you were born. His majesty asked me the truth. So I'll give you some advice, young man. Never tell true for an old especially if they ask. Go now, you bother me. What did she want? I'm not sure. mention me? No. One day, when I command the army, you see ... You know, when I think of it, my blood boils. Tell me friend, has some potion, to lower my fever? Wise men say only a spirit bad can be conducted by others. I mean, another woman? Of course. That noble medicine. I know the right place. A woman of Babylon organizes banquets every night ... And do not bother with two extra guests. - No, I ... - Look, we must celebrate our good fortune. No worries, mate. You are under my protection. Let's go out there and 'll show you the garden. Sinuhe, my friend. Come out in the garden ... pick some flowers. No, you wait here. Okay, I take some for you. Never seen a woman before? Hundreds. And as the gods created them. I'ma doctor. Your name? My name Sinuhe. "He who walks alone." This is your house? This is my home, and I invited every night. I do not like being alone. Baraka! It is the symbol of the new Pharaoh! This is it. I must leave now. Why? Because the man bring you rich gifts, in exchange for a little smile. And that's all I have. Never asked for anything, to no man. But I ask you to stay! I can not ... Is it because we women Babylon we have a bad reputation? Or because they think I'm ugly? Think? You're beautiful ... Beyond any dream. Such flattery is easy to do, for a man who knew hundreds of women. Nothing seemed so beautiful ... so strange. When I see your eyes, I feel ... What you feel, Sinuhe? I feel the fever of Thebes in my blood ... and I know I was born to live at sunset in the world ... and that nothing matters to me ... nothing except what I see in your eyes. It's late, I ... I must go. If you leave excited by wine and wild imaginings. Problems will undoubtedly with some astute woman. Would you care? No, just brought you here, to show him the gate the wall of my garden. Later, When my guests have left ... be here by my side lotus pond. Why do I say that? Perhaps because much like gifts ... and the greatest gift that a man can give a woman ... is their innocence, which he can give only once. Wait. Before I touch, should give a warning. Warning? There is a reason for the Goddess of Love take the form of a cat. When I look at you do not want know gods or cats. Look, Sinuhe, a cat's paws are soft ... but hidden claws. A cat takes pleasure in torment his victim. While the creature is not almost dead ... it does not show penalty or will end sorrow. What does this have to do you and me? Had very little experience ... and I have to be who I am. Get out now. and never again by gate my wall ... or can repent for life. Do not even know your name. In their foolishness ... men gave me a name that means "beautiful." Nefer! Nefer! Not my business, where he spends his time. If it is not your account. Why are you so mad at me? Get out. There's a whole week he tells me, refer patients for other physicians. Even had to return the money, consultations it. This woman you stole the mind. You are crazy as a coyote ... that round about the tombs during drought. And I'm as mad as him. And I warn that against you! So why come to me now? There are worse things than marriage. How could I be so silly, and even dream about it? He is a doctor of Pharaoh, and I ... KapTa, what can I do? It offers more what it can offer. Go away, his son a one-eyed baboon! Out! Out! Why are you waiting for, Sinuhe? I told you that tonight I am committed? I must entertain a merchant in Syria. If he touches you, I the bush. Only boys fools talk that way. I must confess, Sinuhe ... I find you attractive ... very attractive. Not like the others. It is young, strong and innocent. But unfortunately I have to protect myself. Women like me living alone ... can not afford to fall into weakness ... Or end their days begging on the streets. I offer my protection as you live. Men have told me that so many times ... in so many languages! Listen, Sinuhe, I live in Egypt why can not more return to Babylon. When I was 12 I sold as a slave ... and passed a love for others. Is there any difference with your life now? A big difference. Because now no man is my master. The Syrian merchant dine with me tonight ... Give me a ruby belonged to a queen. But give a gift I received the Pharaoh is a sacrilege. I'm not asking for anything. I just want to understand me. Must go now. My guest will be here in a minute. Send him away. I told you I can not. Send him away! You are hurting me. I gave you the only thing value I have. It was not what you wanted? Since men are deceivers, And you're like the rest. Not so poor as it pretends to be, Sinuhe. He has a house .. and many instruments Copper excellent. If you give to me ... promise? Do not promise anything. If you want to give me a gift, then give. But do not ask me anything I do not like him I ask nothing. I'm a bad girl, Sinuhe From the beginning I warned you. Keep your home and their instruments, and exit. Your Highness shoots well for a woman. Children play. I see a promotion. Why not? A real soldier here, is like a hawk among sparrows. I want to talk, come here! I can say that much his dream of a word? Let's not talk of their dreams. I want to talk about his friend the doctor. Why are you so interested in him? My brother has he asked. Not yet presented to the Court. Sinuhe left town. He went to Memphis, I think. Is expected to win new deals do not lie to me. I love my friend to lie for him ... even for a royal princess. Whatever? I want it saved this creature, it stole my mind. It is fcil.Ela of Babylon. Expel it or kill it. He was going after her ... or weep over his grave ... the rest of life. No. He must be convinced that she is worthless. And how do you expect to achieve this? Letting you discover that she betrayed him, with his best friend. You should not think this is difficult. Such a woman likes being attacked, as a fort. Your Highness, flatter me. I measured in the same way ... you evaluate. Give me the bracelet. Whether a reward, to help his friend that both estimates? I want to give to the Babylonians. Are you afraid that your virility is not enough? She did not. My friends are watching us. They think they're giving me an honor. Let them think what they want. One day will undress her arms of honors for me ... his ankles and his neck. Reserve your passions to the Babylonian. She will appreciate more than me. Open up, let me enter. This afternoon, I have orders not to let anyone inside. Thy love is waiting for me, I received a message from her. Those are my orders. Horemheb! Horemheb! Open up, let me in! Horemheb! Nefer, let me in! You should go. He knows he is here. I do not care about you? I had no message for him to come tonight. I took the liberty of have one in your name. Cares? So that's it. Go away. Stupid fool! 'll Kill you! You are crazy! Listen, idiot. Our friendship has brought me here. Do not see what it is? The only reason I have come here, was to prove it. Never call me friend again. Go away. Very good. You deserve everything what it receives. You can go too. This is my home, not a tavern. Nefer, wait. Look here. Brought what I asked ... The deed of my house my instruments. I never asked you this rubbish! It's all I have ... and it is totally rubbish. The house is small but is perfect for the use of a doctor. The instruments are the best. Worth as much as precious stones. Ready ... Now, you have everything what was mine. Please Sinuhe. I'm tired. Always has an excuse, Nefer, I ... Wait. Since we will not listen my warnings ... Compels me to treat you as my other friends. What most want from me? Because you disobeyed Pharaoh disgraced my family, impoverishment ... And yet lie to me. Lying? How ...? Why not tell me ... that his father has a beautiful seaside home? I can not give what is not mine. Or that he built for his wife and himself, a beautiful tomb in City of the Dead? 're Asking me to steal immortality of my parents ... and let their bodies, rot of nowhere ... As the carcasses, slaves and animals? I ask nothing. But if you only do it for me ... I'll show you the absolute perfection of love. What are you doing here? It has gone to tavern for many days. Had to see it. The man who knew, is dead. Forget it. I can not forget. Sinuhe, please listen to me. I want to help you. I am not inexperienced. You learn a lot about life in a tavern. Every night I see the appetite in the eyes of men. With a maid in a tavern ... they do not bother to hide. Some come to you with arrogance Horemheb as your friend. This type can never be hurt by a woman. And there are those timid too much to ask ... But I also wish is in your eyes. Are those who are unarmed, because they are afraid of approaching ... a woman who can make them happy ... become easy victims to another kind of woman. They think they are in love, because there is no other way, of how love is. What are you trying to say? What was not to say ... when he gets home at that time and find me waiting for you. If you want to help me, you can. Here are the scriptures the house of my parents ... and the tomb that they thought would give them immortality. Here is her name, the new owner. Read, Merit: Nefer, Nefer, Nefer! Sinuhe, can not! The scriptures must be witnessed. Be the first to sign. Come on, subscribe! If he does not sign, make your mark! That the gods have pity you! The house and the tomb are his. From now on I am damn and bastard ... before the gods and men. It's a high price to pay. Now prove to me which is not too high. How do I prove, Sinuhe? Delivering on its promise. Promise? What was that promise? The perfection of love. Promised? Sinuhe, as I told you ... I find you very attractive ... Are you sure that perfection is what you want? Yes. Then you have it. I'll end with his martyrdom. Secum! Watch this man to the door. Never let it enters in my house again. All philosophers know we have come to life looking for perfection ... and found that only in the end. In the end? Sooner or later even a cat tired of your game. Sinuhe! Sinuhe! Again I returned alone and in darkness ... home to my parents. The house was not more of them. How did they die? As you know, love, a doctor ... can burn your skin ... taking lives, instead of saving them. Her father had left it. Read. I can not. Then listen. "For Sinuhe, our son. We are suffering because of you, because he had bad luck. Do not whine because you asked to sell our grave ... because all existence is meaningless. and do not want another life. Always remember ... that bless thee before we left. For you who came to us, by the river ... when we were old, was the greatest joy of our lives. His heart is protected from bitterness. This is the wish of his father, and his mother. " They want here House of Death? He brought the bodies a man and a woman ... to be preserved for its art ... and so can enjoy of eternal life. Like you said, here we are artists. What can you pay for our services? I have nothing. Nothing? Throw the burden on the River. Wait! I am willing working here. to pay Embalming ... during the time you might need. Work here? Only convicted felons ... and cursed by the gods, seeking work in this house. No man here is worse than me. Put it to work! For 90 days I lived among damned in the House of Death. It was as if I myself had died. Only my servant, KapTa knew where I was and what I had done. What are you doing here? Speak, or sink your head! Are you a god? God? no god would dare ... show the face after dark. It is a grave robber? Do not come here to steal. And what they want, then? I brought my parents to bury them here. In the Valley of the Kings? I hope that buried here ... they can share ... the wealth of the pharaohs, in the other world! In the other world. It is true that many pharaohs are buried here. but have not seen any of them, going out with his own feet. And certainly not see their wealth, Because we take first. Do not believe in another life. They believed. You're weird. I'll help you dig. I would like to mark their graves somehow. With or without mark is all the same. a pyramid ... The 10 minutes to dig a hole in the ground. Dead is dead, not matter where we put them. In the end, the sand conquers all. Every grain of sand ... survive every man alive ... and every man who will still be born. Immortality? Holding in my hand. Only the small grains Sand will never die. Listen! A coyote. A two-legged jackal. One of my friends telling you that there is a stranger on his way. Here in the shade. Sinuhe! Is this you? Yes. A good place to meet a woman. How do I find? KapTa told me. He told me he did. As he worked 90 days House of Death. Stay away! The smell of death still is in me. How long have not you eat? I do not know. Brought to you bread and wine. Come back, Merit, come back. Leave me alone. Not until we eat. Sit down, Sinuhe, at least for me please. Bread? A little wine. Thebes, city of lust and evil. Your men deserve justice. They deserve their priests wicked and cruel gods ... because we are despicable. Nothing but a slow disease that creeps on the earth. The tomb is only cure for our pettiness. That's what I learned. I'll take back the city. Can not return. Pharaoh's daughter died because was not there to save her. He is angry, hurt. Sinuhe, he ... sentenced him to death. It does not mean anything. Death does not come to everyone who asks. I learned that also in my new wisdom. You call this wisdom? To despise because ... than a woman you did? Do you really think that all women are like that? Do not believe in love asks for nothing? Oh my love! Everything is arranged, love. I bought tickets for us. Bought? He took everything I had ... all that I stole from you. Come on, we have to hide, before the other passengers arrive. Merit ... I do not know how to say this ... Take it with you. Not gold, but ... want to accept. It is the symbol of God the sun, Aton. Maybe again one day ... No. We need not deceive, thinking so. This is a farewell forever. Forever? He's young, Merit, has a lifetime ahead. My end at darkness, in some strange land. I love you, Sinuhe. Always remember that. Hurry Love. So I left behind the land from my parents ... and with it, I left my youth that punished both ... which was full of despair. Over the years, KapTa and I were traveling, to the ends of the earth. In the beginning, we lived as it gave. Solo and friendless, deceived and stole for a living. We know the heat hunger and cold ... and slept under the stars. Then, as time stifled my sorrows ... I began to put into practice, what I learned in school of life ... and my parents' house. As we changed, my fame followed distant lands, where they had never an Egyptian visa before or a doctor prepared. The healings were simpler considered miracles. And I was known as a worker of magic. As we traveled to new land ... our wealth increased. Everywhere we saw injustice and poverty ... but hardened my heart. I booked my skills to the rich and powerful, who could pay. For poor children, there was no cure. Scream when the pain increased. None Hittite Warrior screaming in pain. Here ...? Yes. As feared Noble Commander ... your head must be opened and evil taken with a knife. Egypt is a conspiracy? To assassinate our general, fair ... just as planned fight against Egypt? You who brought me Develon here, gentlemen. I have no interest in your plans. I have no homeland, let alone Egypt. Should I try to cure it? What chances do I have to survive? One out of five. If I die, my officers will kill you. I know. If I live ... This will require? His sword of black metal. Nothing more. - So it's a spy. - No matter. After the first attack, our secret will no longer be secret. After the second ... Egypt also fail to be Egypt. Go ahead, Egyptian. Shave his head, wash. Tie it in that chair with force. I go to prepare a drug to ease your pain. Love, love ... dares to open the head Commander ... asked why only a sword? He could have asked for a fortune. Because I think the new metal from the Hittites, can change history of the world! and why now commands Horemheb the Egyptian army. Now I see that he lied. His heart finally softened. Still loves his homeland. At least never again there. No pharaoh forget their enemies. Put my instruments in the flame. KapTa, we go home. Home ... But Egypt Egypt ... was a land at war ... torn apart by hatred and civil war. I was afraid of the Hittites, love. but I fear it even more. Better that we had not come! Your name, Syrian? I am Egyptian. My name is Sinuhe. Pharaoh's former doctor. It must have been bitten by a monkey angry as a child. You know, that if your name is the list of escaped criminals ... Well, you know the Egyptians ... Arrest them. Take them to the commander. There must be some mistake! See the list again. What do you expect me to do? Bring forth the soldiers of Delta cataracts? Your duty is to maintain order in the city ... Should do so with men who have. Was ordered to never again return to Egypt. Why come back? They say that they drank the waters of the Nile ... can not quench thirst in other lands. I know why you're here. The priests of the ancient gods wait to get rid of pharaoh ... They say that the Pharaoh's crazy and that his head should be opened. It would be a simple act, let the knife slip. Thus brought to Egypt the only man, master of operations. You. Give me the sword got my set up. Give him. That's why I came back Egypt! Drawing his sword. Back. And now? Hit me with strength. Know what you're asking me my friend? Knock! Again, stronger. Where did you get that? In the land of the Hittites. Hundreds of Castings work day and night making weapons of this new metal. called iron. Come with me. The new temple where the Pharaoh worship their God only. Look! I saw the sadness that this one God brought to Egypt. Were the priests, and not Pharaoh, who brought us sorrow. It is they who blamed the Pharaoh misfortune of Egypt ... and made the people believe that so the old gods ... show their anger. For me, hang all the priests by the heels. But Pharaoh was thought to retaliate infidelity with kindness. Come on. Keep standing. I apologize, Your Majesty for interrupting your prayers. I bring urgent news. The sir do not owe me an explanation. Bring someone who will no doubt remember. Sinuhe, the physician. Sinuhe ... Yes. He asks who grants your pardon, your majesty ... And I as commander of the army, also desire to be merciful. It's me who should I ask forgiveness, Sinuhe. Once I raised my hand to and you would have killed him. Glad to see you. Sinuhe has just arrived the land of the Hittites. Are preparing a war against us. They succeeded in discovering a new metal. He brought this sword as evidence. Cut to the Egyptian made of copper, like a knife in the straw. How can this be true? I ordered the cross of Hittite princess to life. I promised them my friends. Akhnaton, my crazy friend ... You think they care about Cross your life? They want to loot, slaves and power! And with that ... able ... unless you let me attack them first, destroying their cities, its mines and smelters. You are asking me to lead to kill? I am asking you to show our enemies, the same treatment ... ... They want to give us. No more, no less. There is mercy in heart of every man ... if we could achieve it. A man who lived in the dark whole life ... luz.Diz not understand what is bad because it hurts your eyes. We then turn off the lights and and crawling in the dark with him? This attitude, my king, has filled Nile bodies. This morning, new disturbances began on the coast. I had to send soldiers to stop them. Do not you see, sir that a war now unite our country? But since the Egyptians will together against a common foe. He's right, my husband. Until you? So close to me is the darkness? Horemheb should listen. I can only listen Aton I will write to the Hittite princess asking for explanation your intentions clearly. Thanks for coming. Now see what I have to fight? It could prevent you from doing whatever you want with the army? No, men meet me and not him. But it is the Pharaoh and swore loyalty to him. He will write to the Hittites ...! You can even invite them to take his throne. Does it matter? I have seen large and Small governors ... old and young ... manly and effeminate. The people are suffering and dying ... whatever the sovereign. Hittites, Egyptians, Cretans ... It is too bad to believe, believes as Pharaoh. But it's worse to believe in so little, my friend. I do not believe in anything. While Egypt was torn a civil war ... I doubled my fortune as a physician of the rich. Have the other patients though. I am tired. I will not see anyone else today. I think I will see that I love, will find rewarding. The query is expensive? Dude no, more interesting. Send them to enter. He will see you. Come back tomorrow sorry, can not do nothing. Can you help? Tell me what is the evil thereof. Give me your hand. Open your toga. Can I save your life ... But I can not restore its beauty. The disease is already well advanced. Want to live, Nefer? Yes .. yes I want to live. Come back tomorrow morning I will try and heal it. Can not pay him. His collar was the only thing left of me. I will not charge for my services. Take. For 10 years I dreamed with it, find it again ... ... When I was you. Accomplish my revenge, slowly tasting it. And it feels now which had its chance? Only penalty. Sadness. Because one day she was very pretty. But a cat can not avoid what it is. It's strange, KapTa. Revenge makes us so empty how much fame and fortune. Egypt is full of it. and still hungry. Love, what you want? I do not know ... but whatever it is, I looking in the wrong places. Love is dangerous to walk in block, without escort. Sights, sounds and smells ... can relive the past. Here, I used to get water for my father. It was a long time. Look, Kaptah! I learned to climb that tree when they could hardly walk. -Leave me alone! Come back here! -Leave me alone! - Do not let him escape! No! The cross is mine! What are they doing? Leave him alone! Enough, out! Are you hurt? No. Where do you live? Right there. Toth, my dear! I'm fine. Is bleeding. It was nothing. Some boys, did not liked my cross. I'll take him to the doctor. Can I help? Sinuhe! Yes, my lord, can. This is Mr. Sinuhe, Toth, A very famous doctor. I'll get a cloth to the bandage. I got it. Merit, after all these years ... Was always present in my prayers, Sinuhe. I thank your God ... it was he who approached us. Want to join? I knew that this was the my father's house? The house was cheap, and needed a place of my own. Her and her husband? I am not married. I found the bandages, Mom. Mother? He is the son of a friend, orphan ... But he did not know, think I'm your mother ... Sinuhe, please ... "I understand. Your secret is safe with this orphan. Please. Here are the bandages. and instruments if you need to use them. When I grow up I want be a doctor too. Hope you use it with more confidence than I do. I bought at the same time I bought the house. I see. Sit on the bed. Hold the bandage. - Iso hurt. - I'm not afraid. I've also been in their prayers? Yes, I asked who taught him Aton humility and good manners. Now I know that we returned home. Only in Egypt, speaking as a woman ... ... Has as sharp tip. In two days you can take the bandage. But not before, you know? - Why? I mean, what will happen If I take? Probably nothing. I spoke frankly with you ... because doctors should be always stand with their patients, you'll discover. Increases their respect for you. and also their fees. But I want to be doctor of the poor. But the rich have diseases most interesting and can afford. No.Vou work for the poor. I'm hungry and you? I can eat a hippopotamus. Today we eat fish. Hurry, Mom! Yes, fast. Quiet you two. Come here! Clean your tools, Thoth and put them in place. I think I see too with his one eye! More than my love with two. If you dare tell him ... Why tell? I like my life as is, without a woman ... that spill hot water on my foot, unpleasant when it ... Questioning my spending, rationing my beer. Merit. I did not ask to come here to intrude into my life. I did not expect .... Smoke! Perhaps you think that the smoke blinded me too. What do you Sinuhe ... the large, wealthy, cynical ... either with a maid in a tavern? Call me big and rich, but I have nothing. I am the poorest man, because I threw my life away. Everything you touched, destroy ... my heritage, my parents, your life too, Merit. But in exchange, you gave me something ... Perhaps the answer to the question I do, since I was a boy. Not your God, for I do not believe in gods ... but a thing created and that was not useless. If it is too late to live for each other ... Maybe we can start live for our son. No, my boy. Let me give you some advice more precious than a gem. Never listen to the windows, matters that are not yours. That's why we only have one eye. Intended to pass without talking to me? I ask pardon of your highness. Pharaoh sent for me. I know. Many years passed, Doctor. Her look of innocence is gone. If His Highness will excuse me ... Heard the news? The Hittites invaded Syria. Their carriages approaching, Nile Delta. Then the war began. No! My brother refuses to give Horemheb permission to fight. So he must be crazy. I know this for a long time. Doctor! After seeing my brother, come to my room. - His Majesty ... - Thanks for coming. Majesty. My friend! Lord, should allow Horemheb defend Egypt. No! No! Right or wrong, I will not order the death. I can not dive Egypt in a bloodbath. They say I'm crazy ... Horemheb, the priests ... even my own sister. They are right, Sinuhe? Am I crazy? Yes, it's crazy, your majesty ... but their folly is more beautiful, that the wisdom of others. Beautiful ... Yes, my vision of Aton was beautiful. I thought it would bring peace and happiness to all men. I thought it might be your voice .. and bring its message to my people. But I was wrong. The vision disappeared. My voice was not more than ... where the wind blows in the desert. Aton abandoned me ... ... By the war, by madness, by death. If you love me, Sinuhe Releases the weight of my soul. Give me peace. The duty of a doctor is to extend the life ... do not shorten it. He should rest now. You can do something for him? Sorry, your disease is not the body, Your Majesty. What do you want? What Pharaoh himself asked him: give him peace. He has more courage than I thought. If Horemheb know that ... My men are ready! The true master! You too? Listen, Sinuhe. I like how Akhnaton my right arm ... But if my arm has gangrene, cut it off. Also like to Akhnaton be cut out of Egypt! Egypt knows all I'm right ... and you also know. Yes I would act in his place of same way. It has a potion that would sleep without pain? I have to kill you ... ... When all around me there is such talent for violence? Do that, and the gods bless forever. I understand, you speak for the gods, Horemheb and Egypt. Tell me something ... who will succeed to the throne? Who else but the master of army, which will save Egypt ... ... And do it again the greatest power on earth? Yes. Horemheb! You, Pharaoh? So this is price for your treason. Call it treason if you want. But there's only one thing that can save Egypt now ... is courage, courage to act, courage to conquer our enemies, and their leaders put in chains. Akhnaton is in its room, helpless. Now is your chance to kill him. But you will not do, right? Because they never raised a hand openly against the Pharaoh. If you kill him, then the way a precedent will be free that will be established, ... To another end with the next Pharaoh whose name you expect that Horemheb. So, this dirt must be done indirectly. As has always been done in the past ... By a physician pretending to cure him ... by a physician who is recognized his friend. Sorry, but I'm not that man. Wait outside. Do not go away. His Highness wanted to see me? Will do what they want? No. Should accept. Akhnaton must die ... for their own good. Now it's for your good. MikeR wants to kill him by the gods. Horemheb in Egypt ... ... And her sister their own good. Any hunter ... show sympathy for a wounded animal. They told you how to plan soiling of the throne? Told me that Horemheb should be the new Pharaoh. And I'll be your queen. He will come to my room tonight ... Tomorrow will be consummated our marriage the temple of the ancient gods. Got it. A good plan. This marriage will make accepted by the people. But not for me, Doctor. When I marry, will not be with the son of a manufacturer of cheese. Skirt! We do not have much time. The men of Horemheb are controlling the town. This evening the priests recolocaro ancient gods in public and make a sacrifice bloody. But together We can beat them ... Horemheb and all the the evil priests. Sinuhe, come here. Here's what you should do: pretend to agree with his plans. Kill my brother Horemheb and kill too. Two murders. So come to my quarter tonight ... and I personally will open the doors with my bare hands. willing to share the throne with you, as Pharaoh. Why do people accept a without physician name, ... As a pharaoh? Because you're a Pharaoh. You are my half brother. It is the only man in Egypt fit to be my husband ... and rule by my side. Why do you think my mother he summoned the first day who entered the palace? Before she died told me everything ... and let me judge if you should know the truth. She was not the first to give a son to my father, the Pharaoh ... few weeks before, a of his other wives ... gave birth to a boy ... You! Was taken from his mother and left adrift on the Nile, in tied with knots of boat hunter. Tied up by my own mother ... who was the daughter of a hunter. And the mother did not notice that her son had disappeared? They showed her a dead girl and said it was her. Hundreds of babies are left adrift, every year ... and the boats are usually tied with us as a hunter. In the Lower Kingdom yes; not at Thebes. But there is evidence stronger than that. Take my chariot! Come with me to the Valley of the Kings the grave of my father ... and see for yourself. Amenhotep III ... the great Pharaoh. My father ... ... And yours. Look! The best artist Thebes did it ... You're just like him. The nose, facial bones, the jaw line. You want further proof. Look! This is what my mother saw, when it came before us. What no one beyond could recognize ... the face of her husband when he was young. The great Pharaoh lives back into you.! Have a question now? Leave me alone here. You know I showed you the truth. Yes, now I'm sure that is true ... but Horemheb accept that evidence? Of course not. Is consumed by his own ambition. He went too far. Could not turn back now even if he wanted. Therefore must be killed, with Akhnaton. Egypt is in your hands, my brother. The power of the gods is his, if you dare to grab it. What is that? What is it? Horemheb began their holy war. Every follower of God of Pharaoh is marked for death. A massacre! Why should we care? Let Horemheb prepare the ground for us. When my brother die and governments ... 'll be much better without these fanatics. Let them go! Merit! Merit! Love, love! Where is your mother? Parted. Listen, KapTa. light the boy to the docks. Here, take this money and these jewels. Find a boat, buy a ... steal one if needed. And you? I'll look for Merit. We will meet as soon as possible but do not wait for us. Take the city boy. I want to go with you. Should go with No. KapTa, my son. Now run. Run! Stop them! Is this yours? Never seen it in my life. You lie! I saw when I threw it away! Be sensitive, captain. I look like a server Aton of the damned? We are simple people, honest ... and I am the greatest Bum of all Egypt. This is your cross? Captain, has a face noble and intelligent. Always collaborate with the soldiers, I myself was one. Actually, I have my eye for my country. Well if that's all ... Kill him! Kill me a thousand crimes, but not by a ever made. I hate the gods! And the gods hate me. Stay with it, and this, gold, silver ... everything I have. I became a beggar and I starve to death while living. Let him go! Come! What can you afford? What can you afford? Give me your jewels! Only those who can afford rise to the board. Give me your jewels! Give me your gold! Only those who can afford can come aboard! Come, go. KapTa, how do we pay? He gave everything he had for those soldiers. Well, not everything! The economies of a dishonest life. Come, come! Please, please. What can you afford? Take this ruby. The child does not occupy space. All right, let him go. Only those who can afford can come aboard. Sit here. Well, I'm afraid that at my age and in all innocence, my father is making. Toth! Toth! Kneel! Aim! Shoot! Merit! Merit! Sinuhe! Not Merit! Merit! Toth? Are you Kaptah. With KapTa is safe. Embrace me, my love. Merit! Bring to surviving the dungeon! I want this house down! Leave no stone unturned! Yes, commander! Archers, follow me. Sorry, my friend. Had to be done. It was not you who killed her, but the madman the palace. He and his single God. She believed in God it and dead. Is he still alive? Yes It's in the palace. Then, go to the palace and I shall meet him there at dawn. How will you give him? A glass of wine. You and I will drink with him. I? We're in this together business, Horemheb ... as we were always together, since we were kids ... Since we're doing is for the good of Egypt ... should feel honored to participate directly. Make sure that it is agreed. Combine our audience. Do not worry. The main will be in the cup of Pharaoh. Then finally took over the court. Why I left on the street? Where did it go? Burying a dream. Is dead and forgotten now. To Pharaoh. For Horemheb. For me. What do you mean? Horemheb is no fool. How can I convince him to drink, if I do not drink too. But it will die. I'ma doctor. This oil will weaken the poison, till I come here to this drug to swallow vomit. And if something goes wrong? Then die anyway. Be careful, my brother. I'll be waiting for you. Let's not pretend, my sister, Our agreement ... is strictly for power. I think it can not be blamed the wickedness in you. Not your fault, it has been distorted ... and twisted like a tree, forced to bloom forever, and not bear fruit. The others made the way it is. But I did hurt myself, and I am aware of that. You should go. Sinuhe, open the door. Sinuhe! Why shut the door? - I was not sure if it would be you. Is everything ready? He's in great room praying to their God only. What is the cup from him? What it will take. Welcome, friends. We came as friends, because they both love him. I know. We were talking about the day we met in the desert. Yes, it was at dawn. I hoped that one day, was the sunrise of the world, but you killed a lion, shedding their blood on the sand. Violence must be faced with violence. Drink, majesty, to our memories. Sinuhe, inviting me to drink? Yes. I drank ... death, Sinuhe? Yes, your majesty. So be it. It's my fault. Gave me what I asked, but was wrong when asked. I was weak. I thought my God, had abandoned me. Not so, Sinuhe ... not like you killed him believes it did. Horemheb tries to kill him destroying their temples ... But the house of God is all creation. Tear down the mountains, empty the oceans, undress the sky of stars, and yet not have touched God. Now I see clearly. I thought God was the face of the sun ... and was so I made your image. But God is more than that ... more. The sun is just a symbol, its warmth ... of his creative power. Not an image ... is not a tangible thing ... but the creator of all things ... is the spirit of love that lives within our hearts. I am luckier than other men ... because He allowed me to recognize him. Stay close to me Sinuhe friend. I can not see it right but I feel no pain. Did not give him pain some, your majesty. Neither my death matter. I was not more than one shadow of things to come. A voice that spoke for Him But there will be other voices, lighter than mine. The hearts of men not be denied forever. God is within us all. One day, the time will come that your voice be heard. With words that can not be misunderstood. The other lied to me, Sinuhe. But I think you really loved me. God forgives everything, Sinuhe. He will forgive you. Poor soul ... crazy till the end. Offer sacrifices the gods on his behalf. Do not refuse me now ... for I am one of them. Am Egypt! His cup, Sinuhe! Drink with me ... Drink at the beginning of a new Egypt! Horemheb ... do not drink it ... or not Egypt! or anything else. How dare you? Put the crown and browse Princess. Will be very surprised because is not waiting for you. But it can prevail and become divine. You even dare! You are the pharaoh Egypt wants. But it was not so I saved it ... Do not thank me for your life. Thank this poor fool, sick here ... it was he who saved us. Saved me? You are crazy too?. I am Pharaoh. Silence! The Pharaoh's coming. Knees. On his knees before the Living God! Majesty! The commanders of the armies defeated ... beg mercy to Pharaoh. I will deal with them later ... Let the doctor approaching! -Kneel! Let him stand. What are the charges against this man? Manifested in public against the Pharaoh ... Belittled the victories of the Pharaoh Syria and the land of the Hittites. Blasphemed against the gods and committed other acts of treason. Once we got together in front of the throne. and you asked for save my life. Is anyone willing to intercede for this man? And you, my devoted wife? No. Must speak for itself, Doctor. Not by me, your majesty ... And yes for those whose memory ... tried to forget ... Whose respectable name tried to destroy. By Akhneton! You bear your treason in my face? This name is banned! Take care, doctor ... or I'll ... Go, go, whatever you want. Win some other battle? Conquer lands without knowing the defeat? Egypt will take the glory, and will watch it die? We live in decay of our world, Horemheb ... And you represent this decline. Nations grow only to fall. Kings build powerful monuments ... only to become in dust. The glory is fleeting like a shadow. All these things take itself the seed of death. Just a thought can withstand ... just a great realization that can grow and prosper ... and a truth can never be killed ... passes in secret heart of one man to another; It is given to child by mother's milk. You are trying to say he would fight against me? Oh! You also win this ... because it fails to silence me. know what to do. What do doctor? Walk among the people and try to answer questions that burn their hearts. The question that has me pursued for a lifetime. and everywhere I spent in the world .. and I answered ... by a dying man. I shall wear clothes of a slave ... I will remove your sandals ... and tell their wives while your fish fry the riverbanks. Shippers from docks, the smiths at their forges, slaves with their play. And tell you: a man can not be judged the color of their skin, by their clothes, their jewelry or their triumphs ... but only for your heart. A good man is better than a bad man. Justice is better that injustice. Pity that using is higher than that uses violence, despite the latter considered Pharaoh and become the landlord. We have only one Lord: the God who created us all. Only His truth is immortal, and His truth, all men are equal. No man is unique. The Verdict: Exile for life! I spent my life seeking knowledge, and that's all I know. I wrote this for you, my son, wherever you are ... and for their children and their children's children. It is a very poor legacy ... But it's all I have. THE BIRTH OF JESUS CHRIST.
