Good, because come tomorrow... I am done, done, done. I'm taking you out. I'm gonna bring you back here. And I'm gonna do that little thing. Liam, uh... about tomorrow. I, uh... Rach, don't tell me you're working tomorrow. Bubba doesn't exactly take no for an answer. Listen, Rach. I start residency in a month. This could be the last time... we really get to spend any time together. Please. Look. Don't make me feel guilty about this, OK? This is my job. All right? And, what, after med school... we're gonna be seventy-five in the red? Liam, I'm-- I'm sorry. OK. Listen. I got to hit the books. I'll talk to you when you get home. OK. Rachel, Rachel, Rachel... Yeah. Thanks for keeping an eye out on me, Bubba. Rachel, stay in the light. Thank you. Did you see it? Did you see it? Did you see it? It was coming for us! Did you see it? What did you see? Did-- did you see what? What did you see? It was coming for us! Did you see it? Did you? Turn around. Let me take a look at that. Let me see. Let me see. We got to get that checked out. You might have a concussion. No, I-- I just-- I want to go home. You can't go home. Liam will take care of it. Please. Who's Liam? My boyfriend. He's-- he's a third-year surgical intern. He hasn't even made resident yet. Are you sure you trust him with your life? - Yes, I-- - I got you. I got you. Come on. Let's go get you checked out. Stay with me. What's your name? Uh, Rachel Wilson. I need you to call Liam. Come on, Rachel. We'll go check out, OK? Sounds like one nasty little accident you got in back there. You're lucky you weren't killed. Yeah. I know. I-- I could have sworn that I saw... What, a tunnel of light? Heard that one before. No. Well... Never mind. Guess your number wasn't up. Wasn't your time to go, huh? What? Can't find your pulse. What? Here. I'll get the doctor. Hello? Is anybody here? Hello? Hello? Hello. Is anybody-- is anybody here? Where is everybody? Hello? Somebody? Where is the cab driver that was just brought in? Hello? Help! Help! Help me! I have no pulse! Ms. Wilson. It's OK! Calm down. I didn't mean to scare you. He's dead. He's dead. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who's dead? The cab driver. He's dead. I think you've been through an incredible trauma... and perhaps it's best if you calm down. No. He's dead! Death killed him! I saw it! There's no bogeyman in there, my darling girl. There's nothing to be afraid of. Don't! Don't go in there! Sorry you had to see this, Rachel. I'm sure they did everything they could to save him. I'm losing my mind. Ms. Wilson! It's all over now. There's nothing to be afraid of. The harder you fight, the worse it will be. It'll all be over soon. Rachel, are you OK? Rachel, stay in the light. Rach? What happened? You fall asleep? I had this dream that... I don't know. I was in this accident. And I-- I ended up in this hospital. A few more seconds, you would have been. No! Rachel! No! Liam! No! No! Liam! Oh, my God. Hello? Somebody? Help! Somebody! Somebody help me! Where am I? Somebody... Somebody help me! Liam! Hey, Karen. I need to see Bubba. Liam, you're not supposed to be in here at all. I know. Trust me. There's other places I'd rather be right now... but Rachel didn't come home from work last night. You haven't heard from her at all? No. She hasn't called or anything. Is he here? No. He probably won't be back for at least two hours. But he's not gonna see you even then. Yeah, he will. Hey. Call me when you hear from her. I will. Leave a message. Thanks. Rachel, hey, it's me. Where the hell are you? I missed my exams because of all this. Um... just... give me a call when you get this message... or the 50 others I've freaking left for you already. I'm worried about you. No! Where am I? Where am I? Where the hell am I? Where the fuck am I? I'm Dr. Brown, Rachel... and I'm here to welcome you to St. Joseph's. What are you talking about? Look. I got to get out of here. I got to see Liam. You can't keep me here! I'm afraid I can, and I will. The harder you fight, the worse it'll be. Where are you taking me? I'm going to introduce you to some of our other guests. Well, good afternoon, Nick. We have a new guest. Hello. Nice to meet you. Nick here arrived to us in a terrible state. Didn't you? He had a psychotic break... after a particularly bad and brutal fistfight. He almost died. But he's making great strides. Shouldn't be long before his next parole hearing. Yeah, looking forward to that, Dr. Brown. Hopefully it'll be seventh time lucky. We'll see, won't we? Are you all right down there? Wouldn't you be happier on the bed? No. I'm fine, doctor. Just needed a change of perspective, like we talked about. That's not quite what I meant, but I appreciate the effort. Seventh time lucky, my ass. You don't mind, do you? It's my one vice. My wife says it'll be the death of me. Well, we all got to go at some point, right? Indeed. What is this place? Oh, think of it as... I don't know. Limbo. Halfway house on your road to recovery. I... excuse me. I haven't done anything wrong. Strictly speaking, you assaulted that nurse. Well, I don't like to make judgments about my patients. I'm sure you had your reasons. Listen. I got to get out of here, OK? My life was in danger. Hey, we're all in danger, isn't that right? We all got to go sometime. Help! Somebody! I'm afraid you're not going anywhere for a little while, Ms. Wilson. This facility was originally built... to house the criminally insane. Lovely. Oh, don't worry, my dear. That part's closed. All that's left is this special place. Oh, OK. OK. Listen to me. I-- I got to talk to whoever is in charge of this place. I'm in charge. Damn it! I warned you, Peter. What are you trying to do, O.D. again? Doc, you got to hook me up. I've been having those dreams again. You'll get what you're prescribed-- nothing more, nothing less. Listen, man. I feel like, you know, death's coming for us. I warned you. What did you just say? You wait for me in the common room. I'll be there in a few moments. Mr. Lambert here needs a little downtime... time to reflect upon what he's done. Wait. Why did you just say that death is coming for us? You can't leave me alone! I'll die inside! You can't! No. No! No! Hello. Um... Hey, do you guys know if there's a phone around here? I can't find one. Right. hey, you know, you sit that close to the TV... you're gonna go blind. Shit. I'm sorry. Ha! Don't even sweat it. She just does that to freak people out. God. What happened to her? Jealous boyfriend. Thought she was looking at other guys. So he decided to put acid in her eyes. Almost killed her. Are you serious? I'm blind, not deaf. Whatever, girl. Your True Hollywood Story ain't no secret. I'm Tia. Rachel. How'd you end up in hell? Uh... don't really know. Actually, that's why I'm looking for the phone. Uh, you? Doc called it a cry for help. I call it a practice run. Rock on. Who's he? That's Stuart. He hasn't said a word since he got here. He's quite a prodigious little artist, though. Oh, my God. Stuart? Stuart, who's-- who's in your picture? Stuart, I said who is in that picture? Lo, the angel of death did descend. Well, well, well, another breakthrough. Here reap the souls of the forsaken. Calm down, Stuart. You're scaring our new guest. He is coming to take us where we belong! It's begun. Hello? Anyone? I thought I told you not to come here again. Rachel didn't come home last night. That's my problem how? All right. I'm the asshole. I'm the jealous boyfriend... who can't take other guys staring at his girl... touching her. It's all in your head, kid. This is a reputable establishment. Please. I have to find her. What do you need from me? What are you up to? Don't worry about it. I can hear you scraping away at something every night. What the hell for? I'm obsessive-compulsive. Can't stop myself. Hmm. See you in the next life. I can't stay here. No. No, I can't be here. I hear that, sister. This is not food. It's wet cement. Don't bother. This is insane. That's right. If you weren't crazy before you got here... Don't fight it. It will only make it worse. What is this? Whoa. Look at this. Look. October, 1966. Saint Joseph's closed due to abuse allegations. It doesn't make sense. No! Stuart! Stuart! Stuart! Stuart! No! Ms. Wilson, what's all the commotion? No! Stuart is dead. Liam? Liam! Rach? You OK? Oh, Jesus. Liam, God... Damn it. You scared me. I... oh, my God. I fell asleep in the tub. I just... No. No! Liam! Liam? Hello? How do you-- how do you fast forward this thing? Get out of there. Messing with my computer stuff. You're a real sweetheart, you know that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. Fast forward. Fast forward. Fast forward. Can you make it go any-- Hey, hey, hey. Hey. All right. There. There she is. She looks so scared. Rachel! You want my soul? Is that it? When you take it, my life's over. Not yet. Nick! I need my meds! I need my meds. I need my meds. I need-- need my meds. No. I need my-- Doc? Doc! Doc Brown! Please! I need my meds! Doc! Nick, how long have you been planning this? Since day one. Since day one? You didn't have a better idea? This is the plan, all right? To the outside world, we're dead. You can't keep us locked up here like animals! Doc! He took Stuart, and he's gonna come back for us! Who's there? Who the hell is that? We're in his control room. No. No. No! Nick. Nick, watch out. There's a phone. Rachel? Liam. Liam, it's Rachel. Shit! Nick, it's not working. Nick. Hello. Liam, are you there? Can you hear me? This you, Rachel? Rachel? Liam, please. OK. Can you hear me? Anything at all? I can't. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Rachel, I can hear a little bit. OK. Liam, I need you to listen to me, OK? We are trapped in this... mental facility hellhole! I don't know-- I wouldn't exactly call it a hellhole, my dear. Rachel? Rachel? Shit. Hellhole? Nick. Nick, he cannot do anything to us. Nick, he can't do this to us. No. I swear... you are not gonna get away with this. I'm afraid the state says otherwise, Ms. Wilson. Perhaps a little time in solitary will help change your att-- No! Looking for these? Elevator keys for the pills. Come on. Come on! We got to get out of here. Give me the keys. OK. You, up, now. Get up, I said! Now! Move! Liam. Hello? Anyone? Death comes to us all. Death and taxes, right? I know you know what happened to my girlfriend. There is a plan. It's a path, a circle. All things that begin must come to an end. What is this hippie talk? What... some call it fate. What happened to Rachel happened for a reason. How do you know her name? Fate was changed. A new circle was forged-- Wait, hold on. Excuse me for being slow... but I don't know what you're talking about. The moment she should have died, a new timeline began. Stop talking in riddles! Tell me what you know. Are you familiar with Saint Joseph? Who? The patron saint of lost souls... Saint Joseph. And? What does that have to do with Rachel? Where is she? Go ask Saint Joseph. Move! Let's go. You say we all face death, right? I mean, that's why we're here, right? It was an experiment. A what? A what? You'd better tell me this is some kind of fucked-up joke. Mass hypnosis. How can six people all share the same delusion? No! That we're all running from the Grim Reaper? Doc, this is no delusion! OK? This is real life. What's happening? Doc here has decided to end his experiment tonight. Ladies, we're going home. Won't do you any good. You can call it up, but it won't open. It's a dead man's lock. It requires two keys, both turned at the same time. I'm afraid Dr. Harr left hours ago with the only other key. We're screwed! There's nowhere to run to in here. There's nowhere to hide! We're gonna die! It's all right, OK? We'll be OK. We'll stay in the light, and we'll be fine. What'd you just say? As long as we stay in the light, he can't touch us. Who told you that? The same person that told you. The same person that told all of us. Ah, yes, your guardian angel. Mass hypnosis at its finest. You know what? We've all escaped death once. We can do this again. Oh, fascinating. The herd mentality in the face of adversity. Know what, Doc? You're next! OK, you guys, we got to split up, find Pete... and get this elevator unlocked, quick. We're gonna die here! Katie! Look. Just do what you have to do... and get us out of here, for God's sake... before it's too late! All right. Let's get out of here. Move! Shit. Katie! Katie! Let me in! It's me! Let me in! Death is out here, and he's coming to get us! OK. OK. Oh, great. This is your plan? You want to hole up in here? Do you have any better ideas? He's gonna find us in here, Katie. Yeah. And we'll be ready. OK. I don't even know what this thing is. It's a generator! Just turn it on, OK? How do I turn it on? I don't know! Figure it out! Shit. God! Keep it down! It's loud enough to wake the dead in here. He knows we're here. It's just a matter of time. Great. Thank you. Thank you. That's really very reassuring. A real "glass is half-full" girl, aren't you? Oh, the glass isn't just half-empty-- the drink is spiked. Oh, tell me. We're in it. Welcome to my world. Just come on! Just do it, OK? If we-- What? What? What is it? What is it? He's coming. Come on. Just do it! Hook it up! OK. What do you want me to do? Ow! Give me something to do! Come here. Come here. Come here. Grab this. All right, Pete, let's go. Well, there's no way he could have got out of there. Locks... I don't think he got out. No, someone got in. Come on, come on, come on. I'm gonna tie this around here. You sure about this? We don't have any other options. OK. I'm gonna try to turn it on. OK. Did you get it? Come on! Bring it here! We're ready! Shut up! You stay here! If you're lucky, we'll come back for you the seventh time you scream. Nick? You don't want to do this! You're never gonna get out of here without me. I can help! Shit! At least give me a Goddamn match! He's heading this way. Oh, God. He's here. I can hear him. Do you smell gasoline? Oh, shit. Oh-- is it in here? Oh, my God! I can't get it off! Somebody get us out! Get back! Get back. - I can't see it! - Your feet. I can't see it! Stop it! I can't. I can't stop it. Tia, do something! I can't stop it. I can't lift it. Hey! Over here! This is the plan? Shit! Go! Go! I can't plug it. Wait. Wait, Tia. He's leaving. He's leaving! We're free! No, we're not free! I can't stop it. It's filling up. We're gonna die in here! What? Oh, my God! What are you fucking saying? I don't want to die in here! Tia, do something. I'm scared! Please do something! Tia! Tia, you have to do something! I've spent days... and months... and years... thinking about how this would happen. And in every situation that I could come up with... the ending is always the same. That it would end... in a place of... Someplace... Enough! Enough! Enough with the practice runs! It's time. It's time. It's time for the real thing. Tia, don't! Tia! Tia! Tia! Go! Jesus, get up! Get up! We got to find someplace to hide. All right. Look around. OK. OK. There's a flashlight right there. I'll try to get it. Move. All right. When I tell you to go, head straight for the door... - All right? - OK. Go. Go. That's not gonna hold him! Shit! It's locked! Come on. Here. Here. Here. Right here. - Hello? - Liam. Professor Coley, hey. Thank you for calling me back so fast. I know it's late. I just-- quick question. Do you know of anything in town... that refers to a Saint Joseph, like a mission, a church, anything? Yes, actually. It's an institution for the insane. Are you still there? Yeah, I'm still here. Um... an institution? Yes. Why? Oh, I'm just-- I'm-- I'm doing some research for a paper. Do you know by any chance where that is? On the south side of town by the old church. But it was closed in 1966 due to abuse allegations. Closed in sixty-six due to abuse allegations. All right. Um... all right. South side of town by the church. Thank you, sir. Rachel. What was that? I don't know! He said it was a study. He was studying us to see how we shared the same delusion... a vision of death. Nick! He lied. Yeah. No shit! But why? What is this? Because I made a deal. You. You made a deal with the Devil? Angel of Death, Memnoch, the Grim Reaper. Packet warns that one out of three smokers will get lung cancer. Well... I lost the bet. So you faced death. And I made a deal. Spare me, and I collect the souls he failed to reap. How? My wife. Still works in the nursing field. Couple of name changes... and you two end up in the E.R. near death. You two fell over the edge, and you lived. You tricked fate. Next time death comes for you, there'll be no reprieve. I fucking knew it. Where is it? Pete, is that you? Pete. Pete? Pete? What? Who's that? What the fuck is that? I put my mark on the door! Pass on by. Pass on by! Look at you. Look at yourself. Just look. Brain-damaged street fighter. You should have died in that fight. Nick, don't listen to him. And you, a glorified stripper... who'd miss you if you died like you were supposed to? Liam. Nick, you got to see this. What? It says that we can change it. It says that you can change the circle of fate. So is that right, Doc, huh? You've done your research. How do we end this bullshit? There's one way... but I doubt very much if you two... would be willing to pay the price. No, no! Pass on by! Katie? Look. I told you, you're on your own. Jeez. What? What'd you do that for? Pass on by! Pass on by! Get away from me! Get away from me. Pass on by! No, no. Get away from me. Pass on by! No. No. Stay-- no! You're a liar. There's got to be another way out of this. You asked me. I told you. Now, do you mind calling off your guard dog? You know what? You're gonna get what's coming to you, OK? This life and the next, I promise. God damn it. We got to be missing something. Look at this! There's got to be another way out! Just forget it, all right? I say we find Pete and get the hell out of here. Nick, it doesn't matter how far we run from this place. We got to change our fate. She's right, Nicholas. I merely provided a one-stop shop for our deadly friend. Truth is, he would have found all of you eventually. Can't stay in the light forever. There's got to be a way to beat this fucker at his own game. This is insane. Look. Let's just keep looking, OK? What are you hiding in here, Doc? Nick! Oh, my God, Nick! Go! No! No! - No! - Rachel! Liam! Liam! Oh, my God, come on! Come on! What the hell was that? What do you think? I don't know what to think right now. What's going on, Rachel? I'm lost. I need you to listen to me, OK? - OK. - There was an accident. Yeah, I saw. I saw the security tape. No, listen. I should have been dead, OK? How did you end up in a madhouse? I don't-- I don't know. OK? And now that-- now there's this thing, this... God. Liam, Death is chasing me. Do you know how crazy all this sounds? You think I don't know that? There's a way out. There has to be a way out. There's only one way. I gotta die. What do you-- Don't even joke about that. I'm not. Liam... look. That's the only way this bullshit's gonna end, OK? I gotta die to change this circle of fate. No. No, there's a way out. Come on. There has to be. No, please! I need you to listen to me, OK? That car crash-- I was supposed to die. That was my fate, and now-- now I got to go back and change it. By dying? By going to the edge of death. I'm not gonna let you do this. I'm not gonna let you kill yourself. I'm not. You are. I'll what? You are. You're gonna do what... You've been training all these years. I've been training to save people. And you are. OK? Soon as I save myself. All right. Oh, Rachel? Rachel! Come out of the dark, Rachel. Your doctor can help you. What the... Liam, hurry. I am. Come on! Here. You got everything? I can't do this, Rach. You got to, OK? Just-- just make it fast... 'cause you know I hate needles, OK? It's gonna get real cold real quick. How long will I have once I... Seven minutes. I love you so much. You bring me back. You promise. I will. No matter what, I will. - OK. - Now, now. Rachel? You're doing just fine, Rachel. Hang in there, now. About six minutes left, hon. Doing just great. Rachel! All right. Hang on, baby. This is gonna bring you back. Don't worry, sweetie. Don't worry, Rachel. All right. All right, sweetie. Three more minutes. You're doing just fine. Doing great, Rachel. Rachel. Hey! Where do you think you're going? How tender. Come here to save the day, have we? Life is full of choices, young man. You choose to fall in love with a dead woman... you face the consequences. You come here in a vain attempt to save her life... you face the consequences. You choose to look death in the face-- Shit. Come on, sweetheart. Come on, sweetie. Come on, sweetie. Come on. One, two, three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine, ten... eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. Rachel, I need you to do this, honey. Come on, now. Come on! Come on, Rachel. Please, honey. Please, please, please, don't go. Come on, now, honey, please. Please, wake up for me, Rachel. Wake up for me. I know you can, sweetie. I know you can, Rachel. Wake up for me, now. Don't do this, now, Rachel! Come on, now! Come back to me, Rachel. Damn it, Rachel, come on! Come out of it, Rachel, come on! Come on, honey. Come on, sweetheart. Damn it, Rachel, come on! Come-- It's OK. I thought I lost you, sweetie. You can't get rid of me that easily. Oh, sweetie. Sweetie! Babe, I'm home. Liam? Liam, where are you? It's Dr. Liam to you. - You got in? - Mm-hmm. My own personal physician? But it's gonna cost you now... because I'm making the big bucks. Well, I want to take you out... and then, I want to... Wow. You know, as a doctor... I can't recommend that. It could be too dangerous. - No. - Yeah. No. So sorry. - Really? - Yeah. - Yeah. - No. Come back to bed. You've got to be exhausted. After what we just did... Honey, I'm spent. I learned some new tricks in anatomy class. Shut up! Listen. Rach... Been thinking... about me and you. What do you think about maybe, you know... you and me getting... you know...
