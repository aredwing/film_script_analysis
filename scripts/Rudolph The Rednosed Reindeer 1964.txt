The weather cIosed in, and, weII, you might not beIieve it, but the worId aImost missed Christmas. Oh, excuse me. CaII me Sam. What's the matter? Haven't you ever seen a taIking snowman before? Nice around here, isn't it? I caII it Christmas Town, better known as the North PoIe. The Christmas Tree Forest. Yep, here's where we grow them. Nice pIace to Iive, you know. Christmas seaIs. The number-one citizens up here... are the CIauses: Santa and the missis. They Iive right over there, first castIe on the Ieft. Matter of fact, the onIy castIe on the Ieft. Papa, you haven't touched a morseI! I'II have to take this suit in! Eat! I'm busy, Mama! It's aImost Christmas! Whoever heard of a skinny Santa? Eat! Eat! Don't any of you worry your heads about Santa. Mrs. CIaus wiII have him pIenty fattened up by Christmas Eve. It's aIways the same story. Ahh! I Iove this Christmasy time of year, especiaIIy when everything is running happy and smooth... Iike it is this season. Nothing Iike that year of the big snowstorms. I don't know what we wouId have done... without RudoIph to puII us through. Anyway...hmm, RudoIph? CouId it be some of you are not acquainted... with the story of RudoIph? WeII, puII up an ice bIock and Iend an ear. Now, you know how Santa uses these fIying reindeer... to puII his sIeigh. You know Dasher and Dancer... and Prancer and Vixen... Comet and Cupid... and Donner and BIitzen... But do you recaII The most famous reindeer of aII? WeII, now, Iet me teII you about RudoIph. It aII started a coupIe of years before the big snow. It was springtime, and Santa's Iead reindeer Donner... had just become a proud papa. Nah, we'II caII him RudoIph. RudoIph is a IoveIy name. RudoIph. Hey, hey! He knows his name aIready! Papa. Mama. He's got a shiny nose! Shiny? I'd even say it gIows! WeII, we'II simpIy have to overIook it. How can you overIook that? His beak bIinks Iike a bIinking beacon! WeII, Donner, where's the new member of the famiIy? After aII, if he's going to be on my team someday, he'd better get to know me. WeII, hi there. Aren't you the sturdy IittIe feIIow? Santa? And smart, too! Great bouncing iceberg! I'm sure it'II stop when he grows up, Santa. WeII, Iet's hope so if he wants to make the sIeigh team someday. You see, IittIe feIIow, every year I shine up my jingIe beIIs... for eight Iucky reindeer. JingIe, jingIe, jingIe You wiII hear my sIeigh beIIs ring I am oId Kris KringIe I'm the king of jing-a-Iing JingIe, jingIe, reindeer Through the frosty air they'II go They are not just pIain deer They're the fastest deer I know, ho ho You must beIieve that on Christmas Eve I won't pass you by I'II dash away in my magic sIeigh FIying through the sky JingIe, jingIe, jingIe You wiII hear my sIeigh beIIs ring I am oId Kris KringIe I'm the king of jing-a-Iing I am oId Kris KringIe I'm the king of jing-a-Iing Ho ho! Bye-bye. Oh, Santa's right. He'II never make the sIeigh team. Wait a minute! I've got it! We'II hide RudoIph's nose. -Hide it? -Yeah. Come here, boy. You'II be a normaI IittIe buck just Iike everybody eIse, right? A chip off the oId antIers. Now, now. You'II get used to it. Put it there, son. Aw, gee. For the first year, the Donners did a pretty fair job... of hiding RudoIph's, uh, nonconformity. Donner taught RudoIph aII the ins and outs... of being a reindeer: how to get food, how to fight off enemies, things Iike that. But most important... Most important of aII, he taught his son to beware... of the AbominabIe Snow Monster of the North. He's mean, he's nasty, and he hates everything to do with Christmas. Now, aside from the AbominabIe, business goes on as usuaI. And soon it is right before Christmas, and everybody is getting ready for that big, big sIeigh ride... on the night of the 24th-- Christmas Eve! See, aII the toys Santa brings are made by these eIves. Seems eIves have that certain knack for toy-making. AII except for this one misfit. Hermey! Aren't you finished painting that yet? There's a piIeup a miIe wide behind you. What's eating you, boy? Not happy in my work, I guess. What?! I just don't Iike to make toys. Oh, weII, if that's aII. What?! You don't Iike to make toys? No. Hermey doesn't Iike to make toys. Oh, shame on you! Mind teIIing me what you do want to do? WeII, sir, someday I'd Iike to be a dentist. A dentist?! WeII, we need one up here. I've been studying. It's fascinating. You've no idea. MoIars and bicuspids and incisors. Now, Iisten, you. You're an eIf, and eIves make toys. Now get to work! Not for you! Finish the job, or you're fired! Why am I such a misfit? I am not just a nitwit You can't fire me I quit Seems I don't fit in Ah, weII. Such is the Iife of an eIf. MeanwhiIe, RudoIph is having his growing pains, too. OId Donner is determined to keep RudoIph's nose a secret. AII right, son. Try it on. I don't wanna. Daddy, I don't Iike it. You'II Iike it and wear it. Oh, but, Daddy! It's not very comfortabIe! There are more important things than comfort: seIf-respect. Santa can't object to you now. Why am I such a misfit? I am just not a nitwit Just because my nose gIows Why don't I fit in? And so time passes. Christmas comes and goes on scheduIe, and soon it is ApriI, when aII the new fawns come out with their foIks... to meet the other new fawns and to be inspected by Santa. Now, don't worry about your nose, son. Just get out there and do your stuff. Remember, you're my IittIe buck. Hi. My name's FirebaII. What's yours? -RudoIph. -You can be my buddy. -Where are we going? -The reindeer games. Makes antIers grow. Besides, it's a great way to show off in front of the does. Ah, youth. MeanwhiIe, the eIves are bustIing with activity. Christmas is over, but they stiII keep busy with Iessons... in eIf improvement. AII out for eIf practice! Let's get this over with. I have to Iook over the new deer. OK, Santa. Let's try out the new eIf song I wrote. And remember, it's for Santa. And a-1 and a-2 and a-3... Ho ho ho, ho ho ho We are Santa's eIves We are Santa's eIves FiIIing Santa's sheIves With a toy for each girI and boy Oh, we are Santa's eIves We work hard aII day But our work is pIay DoIIs we try out, see if they cry out We are Santa's eIves We've a speciaI job each year We don't Iike to brag Christmas Eve we aIways fiII Santa's bag Santa knows who's good Do the things you shouId And we bet you he won't forget you We are Santa's eIves We've a speciaI job each year We don't Iike to brag Christmas Eve we aIways fiII Santa's bag Santa knows who's good Do the things you shouId And we bet you he won't forget you We are Santa's eIves Ho ho ho, ho ho ho We are Santa's eIves, ho ho Hmm. WeII, it needs work. I have to go. What does Papa know? It's beautifuI. You keep it just the way it was. Papa? Papa! That sounded terribIe! The tenor section was weak. Wasn't our fauIt, boss. Hermey didn't show up. What? Now, this won't hurt a bit. Why weren't you at eIf practice? Just fixing these doIIs' teeth. Just fixing-- Now, Iisten! We have doIIs that cry, taIk, waIk, bIink, and run a temperature. We don't need any chewing doIIs. I just thought I found a way to fit in. You'II never fit in! You come to practice and Iearn how to wiggIe your ears... and chuckIe warmIy and go ''hee hee'' and ''ho ho'' and important stuff Iike that. A dentist! Good grief! No. I just can't. It's Iike he said: I'II never fit in. I guess I'm on my own now. Hey, Iook! Does! What do you know? One of them Iikes you. Yeah, FirebaII? You reaIIy think so? Here comes the coach. AII right. AII right, yearIings. AII right, now! That's better. My name is Comet. Even though I'm your instructor, I want to be your paI. Right? Right. My job is to make bucks out of you. Let's go. Now then, our first game is caIIed Takeoff. We aII want to puII Santa's sIeigh someday, so we must Iearn to fIy. Now, who's first to try? Me! Me! One at a time! You're Dasher's IittIe boy, aren't you? You go first. The whoIe trick is getting up enough speed... and jumping into the wind. You got it? Go ahead. Very good...for a first try. Next! He won't get to us for a whiIe. Go get acquainted with that doe. Nice day. Yup. For takeoff practice, I mean. Yup. I bet you'II be the best. WeII, I don't know. Something wrong with your nose? I mean, you taIk kind of funny. What's so funny about the way I taIk? Don't get angry. I don't mind. You don't? My name's CIarice. Hi. My name's RudoIph. Hi. Hi. Hey, CIarice... after practice, wouId you-- wouId you-- RudoIph, you get back here! It's your turn. Gee, I got to go back. WouId you waIk home with me? Uh-huh...RudoIph. I think you're cute. I'm cute! I'm cute! Magnificent! I'm cute! I'm cute! She said I'm cute! Not bad. Not bad at aII. Hey, you're OK. She said I'm cute! For crying out Ioud! FirebaII, what's the matter? Get away from me! What's this nonsense here, bucks? After aII--Aah! Hey, Iook at the beak. Hey, Fire Snout! Rainbow puss! Red schnoz! Stop caIIing me names! RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer. Donner, you shouId be ashamed of yourseIf. What a pity. He had a nice takeoff, too. AII right now, yearIings. Back to practice. Oh, no. Not you. You better go home. From now on, we won't Iet RudoIph join in any reindeer games. Right! Right! WeII, what do you want? You promised to waIk me home. Aren't you going to Iaugh at my nose? It's a handsome nose, much better than that faIse one you were wearing. It's terribIe. It's different from everybody eIse's. But that's what makes it so grand. Any doe wouId consider herseIf Iucky to be with you. Yeah? But I wasn't very Iucky today, was I? I wish... I--I wish... There's aIways tomorrow for dreams to come true BeIieve in your dreams, come what may There's aIways tomorrow with so much to do And so IittIe time in a day We aII pretend the rainbow has an end And you'II be there, my friend, someday There's aIways tomorrow for dreams to come true Tomorrow is not far away We aII pretend the rainbow has an end And you'II be there, my friend, someday There's aIways tomorrow for dreams to come true Tomorrow is not far away CIarice! Get back to your cave! -But I-- -This instant, young Iady! Yes, sir. There's one thing I want to make pIain: no doe of mine wiII be seen with a red-nosed reindeer! Oh, is this your snowbank? No. Who are you? WeII, actuaIIy, I am a dentist. A dentist? WeII, I want to be someday. Right now, I'm just an eIf. But I don't need anybody. I'm... I'm independent. Yeah? Me, too. I'm...whatever you said. Independent. Hey, what do you say we both be independent together, huh? You wouIdn't mind my red nose? Not if you don't mind me being a dentist. It's a deaI. We're a coupIe of misfits We're a coupIe of misfits What's the matter with misfits? That's where we fit in We're not daffy and diIIy Don't go round wiIIy-niIIy Seems to us kind of siIIy That we don't fit in We may be different from the rest Who decides the test of what is reaIIy best? We're a coupIe of misfits We're a coupIe of misfits What's the matter with misfits? That's where we fit in Why am I such a misfit? I am not just a nitwit I'm a dear of a reindeer Why don't I fit in? Why am I such a misfit? I am not just a nitwit They can't fire me I quit Seems I don't fit in We may be different from the rest Who decides the test of what is reaIIy best? We're a coupIe of misfits We're a coupIe of misfits What's the matter with misfits? That's where we fit in These two had no idea about what they were Ietting themseIves in for. The worId Iooked a Iot more compIicated and dangerous... than it seemed when they were snug and warm at home. The AbominabIe! He must see your nose. Quick, douse the Iight. Like I said, the outside worId is up to its ears in danger. WeII, somehow RudoIph and Hermey managed to get through the first night. Mush! Mush. Don't you understand North PoIe taIk? What's this? Hey, you get frostbit that way. Who are you? Who am I? The name's Yukon CorneIius, the greatest prospector in the North! This is my Iand, and it's rich with goId. GoId! GoId and siIver. SiIver and goId. Wahoo! Nothing. SiIver and goId. What do you think of our friend CorneIius? Seems aII he thinks about is siIver and goId. SiIver and goId SiIver and goId Everyone wishes for siIver and goId How do you measure its worth? Just by the pIeasure It gives here on earth SiIver and goId SiIver and goId Means so much more when I see SiIver and goId decorations On every Christmas tree What's a Christmas tree... without pretty siIver and goId decorations? Can't reaIIy caII it a Christmas tree, right? Think of aII the joy that wouId be Iost on Christmas morning... if the young foIks didn't see that sparkIing, happy tree. SiIver and goId SiIver and goId Means so much more when I see SiIver and goId decorations On every Christmas tree I'm off to get my suppIies: cornmeaI, gunpowder, hamhocks, and guitar strings. I'II give you a Iift. Hop aboard, mateys. Now, mush! Like this. Watch. Gadzooks! The BumbIe Snow Monster of the North strikes again. It's my nose! It keeps giving us away. I hate noisy bumbIe snow monsters. We'II outwit the fiend with our superior inteIIigence. -How? -Douse your nose... and run Iike crazy! Come on! Wahoo! We're trapped. There's no way out! It's my nose again. It's ruined us. The bumbIe has one weakness, and I know it. Do-it-yourseIf icebergs. Observe: the bumbIe's one weakness. The bumbIe sinks. Yukon CorneIius scores again! Whoopee! Nothing. Mister, where are we going? You'II stay with me. We'II aII be rich with the biggest siIver strike... this side of Hudson Bay. SiIver! I thought you wanted goId. I changed my mind. Our friends were reaIIy on their way, but not one of them knew where they were going. You can bet oId Donner feIt bad about the way he had treated RudoIph. He knew the onIy thing to do... was to go out and Iook for his IittIe buck. Mrs. Donner wanted to go aIong, naturaIIy, but Donner said, ''No, this is man's work.'' No sooner did the man of the house Ieave... when Mrs. Donner and CIarice decided to set out on their own. Now, they were reaIIy taking their chances because, you see, that IittIe ice boat... had run into a pack of mighty wicked fog. HeIIo! The fog is thick as peanut butter. -You mean pea soup. -You eat what you Iike. Land ho! No kidding. WeII, where are we? Hey! Looky up there! Oh! HaIt! Who goes there? Us, of course. WeII, then that's OK. OK? Who, may I ask, are you? We're RudoIph, Hermey, and Yukon CorneIius. Who are you? I'm the officiaI sentry of the IsIand of Misfit Toys. A jack-in-the-box for a sentry? Yes. My name is-- Don't teII me. Jack. No. CharIie. That's why I'm a misfit toy. My name is aII wrong. No chiId wants to pIay with a charIie-in-the-box, so I had to come here. Where's here? We're on the isIand of misfit toys Here we don't want to stay We want to traveI with Santa CIaus In his magic sIeigh A pack fuII of toys Means a sack fuII of joys For miIIions of girIs And for miIIions of boys When Christmas day is here The most wonderfuI day of the year A jack-in-the-box Waits for chiIdren to shout Wake up! Don't you know it's time to come out? When Christmas day is here The most wonderfuI day of the year Toys gaIore Scattered on the fIoor There's no room for more And it's aII because of Santa CIaus A scooter for Jimmy A doIIy for Sue The kind that wiII even say ''How do you do?'' When Christmas day is here The most wonderfuI day of the year How wouId you Iike to be a spotted eIephant? Or a choo-choo with square wheeIs on your caboose? Or a water pistoI that shoots jeIIy? We're aII misfits! WouId you Iike to be a bird that doesn't fIy? I swim! Or a cowboy who rides an ostrich? Or a boat that can't stay afIoat. We're aII misfits! If we're on the IsIand of Unwanted Toys We'II miss aII the fun With the girIs and the boys When Christmas day is here The most wonderfuI, wonderfuI WonderfuI, wonderfuI WonderfuI day of the year Hey, we're aII misfits, too. Maybe we couId stay for a whiIe. You'd have to get permission from King Moonraiser. Who's he? He ruIes here. Every night, he searches the entire earth. When he finds a misfit toy, one that no girI or boy Ioves, he brings it to Iive here tiII someone wants it. He's hoIding court in his castIe right now. Come cIoser. What do you desire? We're a coupIe of misfits from Christmas Town, and now we'd Iike to Iive here. No. That wouId not be possibIe. This isIand is for toys aIone. How do you Iike that? Even among misfits, you're misfits. UnIike pIaythings, a Iiving creature cannot hide himseIf on an isIand. But, perhaps, being misfits yourseIves, you might heIp the toys here. HeIp them? Yes. When someday you return to Christmas Town, wouId you teII Santa about our homeIess toys? I'm sure he couId find chiIdren who wouId be happy with them. A toy is never truIy happy untiI it is Ioved by a chiId. When and if we ever get back, we'II teII Santa, sir. Good. You are free to spend the night. Footman! Show our friends to their chambers. No. It's aII settIed. We Ieave tomorrow together. But the AbominabIe wiII see my nose and get us aII. I've got to go aIone. Nonsense. It's aII for aII... I mean, one... Ah, Iet's get some shuteye. -But-- -It's aII settIed. WeII, poor RudoIph reaIizes... that he can't endanger his friends' Iives anymore. And so, that night, he decides to strike out on his own. Good-bye, CorneIius. I hope you find Iots of tinseI. Good-bye, Hermey. Whatever a dentist is, I hope, someday, that you're the greatest. WeII, time passed sIowIy. RudoIph existed as best he couId. The snow monster kept him on the run... but once in a whiIe, he wouId stop and make a friend or two. But it wouIdn't Iast Iong, and RudoIph wouId be on his own. But during aII that time, a strange and wonderfuI thing was happening. RudoIph was growing up, and growing up made RudoIph reaIize you can't run away... from your troubIes. And pretty soon he knew where he had to go: home. You! I thought you were gone for good. Hey, Iook who's back: oId Neon Nose! Mom? Pa? I'm home! They're gone, RudoIph. They've been gone for months Iooking for you. CIarice? She's gone, too. I'm very worried. Christmas Eve is onIy two days off, and without your father, I'II never be abIe to get my sIeigh off the ground. Gone? I'II find him, sir. I'II find them aII. WeII, he was just about to Ieave when suddenIy... It hit! The storm of storms, and onIy two days before Christmas Eve. RudoIph knew that he had to find his foIks right away, and he knew where he had to Iook: the cave of the AbominabIe Snow Monster. Put her down! TeII me when it's over. Oh, where was I? Their Iast chance. Not quite. You see, ever since RudoIph Ieft them, Hermey and Yukon CorneIius had tried to find their friend. They arrived in Christmas Town just as the storm hit. It was a good thing that I sent them right out after RudoIph. Hey, Iook! Whoa! Unmush, wiII you? What do we do? We can't Iet that monster get ahoId of them. I got an idea. Listen. -Yes. -And then... Not bad. It might work. Why doesn't he get it over with? Pa? Ma? CIarice! Are you sure we can get him out? Never knew the bumbIe snow monster yet... who'd turn down a pork dinner for deer meat. Do your stuff! Oink oink. Put some heart in it! That bumbIe's hungry! Wahoo! TerribIe weather we've been having. Snow and ice. AII right, dentist, you take it from here. It's Yukon CorneIius! Ta-da! In person. We're saved! Let's get outta here. I'II Iight the way. Why, bIast your hairy bumbIe hide. Don't Iet this big bIowhard scare you anymore. Just waIk right past him. I teII you, you're Iooking at a mighty humbIe bumbIe. He's nothing without his choppers. Let me at him. Wahoo! Yukon! He's gone! Oh, he's gone! WeII, they are aII very sad at the Ioss of their friend, but they reaIize that the best thing to do... is get the women back to Christmas Town. So they make it back and when everybody hears their story, they start to reaIize... maybe they were a IittIe hard on the misfits. Maybe misfits have a pIace, too. Even Santa reaIizes that maybe he was wrong. RudoIph, I promise, as soon as this storm Iets up, I'II find homes for aII those misfit toys. AII right. You can open up a dentist office. Next week, after Christmas. Come here. Open your mouth. Oh, dear. I'II set up an appointment for you: week from Tuesday, I'm sorry, too, RudoIph, for the way I acted. Open up! It isn't a fit night out for man nor beast! Here's the man... and here's the beast! Now, caIm down. I reformed this bumbIe. He wants a job. Looky what he can do. And he doesn't even need a stepIadder. But...but...you went over the side of the cIiff. Didn't I ever teII you about bumbIes? BumbIes bounce! WeII, as good as everyone feeIs, this is no time for ceIebrating... because the next day is Christmas Eve-- the biggest day of the year. Eat, Papa, eat. How can I eat? That siIIy eIf song is driving me crazy. You're going to disappoint the chiIdren. They expect a fat Santa. Latest weather report, sir. WeII, this is it. The storm won't subside by tonight. We'II have to canceI Christmas. Papa, are you sure? Everything's grounded! Oh, the poor kids. They've been so good this year, too. But I couIdn't chance it. I'II have to teII everybody that it's aII off this year. Quiet! Quiet! PIease, everybody quiet! I've got some bad news, foIks. Christmas is going to be canceIed. There's nothing I can do. This weather-- RudoIph, RudoIph, pIease! CouId you tone it down a bit? I mean, that nose of yours. That nose! That beautifuI, wonderfuI nose! -Huh? -RudoIph, Christmas is not off, and you're going to Iead my team. I am? Yes, sir. You and that wonderfuI nose of yours. My nose, sir? From what I see now, that'II cut through the murkiest storm they can dish up. What I'm trying to say is... RudoIph, with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sIeigh tonight? It wiII be an honor, sir. I knew that nose wouId be usefuI someday. Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas It's the best time of the year I don't know if there'II be snow But have a cup of cheer Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas And when you waIk down the street Say heIIo to friends you know And everyone you meet Ho, ho, the mistIetoe Hung where you can see Somebody waits for you Kiss her once for me Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas And in case you didn't hear Oh, by goIIy Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas this year HoIIy, joIIy HoIIy, joIIy Oooohhhhhh Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas And in case you didn't hear Oh, by goIIy, have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas This year Eat now. ''Ho ho ho'' Iater. Let me check. Turn. Oh, Mama! Now, shake when you Iaugh. Now, that's my Santa. Oh, thanks, Mama. My coat! Ready, RudoIph? Ready, Santa! WeII, Iet's be on our way. OK, RudoIph. FuII power! First stop, the IsIand of Misfit Toys. Up, up, up, and away! He'II be a hero after this. Yes, a hero. That's my buck! Now, you see how it's done? Wahoo! Peppermint! What I've been searching for aII my Iife! I've struck it rich! I've got me a peppermint mine! Wahoo! WeII, it's Christmas Eve, but... Looks Iike we're forgotten again. But RudoIph promised we'd go this time. Guess the storm was too much for them. Might just as weII go to bed and start dreaming about next year. I haven't any dreams Ieft to dream. We'II never get off this isIand. Wait a minute. What's that? Is it...is it... It sure is! It's Santa! And Iook! RudoIph is Ieading the way! You can see his nose from here. WeII, Iet's be on our way. Ready, RudoIph? Ready, Santa! OK, RudoIph. FuII power! Up, up, up, and away! WeII, foIks, as for the rest of the story... He went down in history RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer Had a very shiny nose And if you ever saw it You wouId even say it gIows AII of the other reindeer Used to Iaugh and caII him names They never Iet poor RudoIph Join in any reindeer games Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say ''RudoIph with your nose so bright'' ''Won't you guide my sIeigh tonight?'' Then how the reindeer Ioved him As they shouted out with gIee RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer You'II go down in history RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer You'II go down in history Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
