Recently, a close friend of mine explained an excellent concept to me. Soft power. If power needs to be compared.. ..then analyse this. In 2034.. ..our population.. ..will exceed China. We have nuclear power. Our army.. ..is listed among the top 5 armies in the world. In lndia.. ..every month.. ..around 15 million cellphones are sold. Soft power. Yoga, Gandhi. Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan. Ayurved, Basmati rice. Tandoori Chicken. The list is long. Soft power is beyond power politics and money. It's an identity. India's heritage.. ..is attracting the entireworld to herself. This is our soft power. And it is not dependent upon any fluctuation.. ..is independent of the fluctuations ofthe stock market. Three unknown suicide bombers.. ..in Wuppertal, Germany.. ..mocked the level three security. And during the bombings.. ..in Wuppertal, Germany.. ..Indian Home Minister Mr. Manohar Kamat had a heart attack. He has been admitted at AllMS in New Delhi. And the condition is critical. Sharma. Heart attack! I'm Menon. I'm taking over. Hi, I'm Pandey. I'm senior.. - Okay. Let's get to work. Tell mewhat's going on? Out ofthe three faces, one man is ours. AgentArjun Sahu. Like Arjun, the other two are.. ..experienced and senior agents.. ..with the ClA, MOSSAD. Like Arjun, they too were kidnapped.. And the forensics found from the debris of the car.. ..shows us that.. ..they.. ..were underthe influence ofsome sophisticated drugs. Any updates from AllMS? This is a kind of exotic virus. Rare. Very rare. Wewill need more time. Atleast twenty four hours. You have onlyten hours. In my opinion, Wuppertal bombing.. ..was just to infect our Home minister. The odd thing is that if.. ..that was the sole motive, they could've done it discreetly. Someone is taunting us that.. ..I'm more powerful than you! Recap. Point no. 1. Level 3 security is the world's most stringent security.. ..he cut through it so easilythat.. ..its laughable. Point no. 2. Our minister.. ..has been infected by a virus.. ..an unknown virus. India's top scientists are unable to even identify its name. Sad! Behind all this.. ..is a man who is.. ..not going to.. ..do it anything discreetly becausethat's not his personality. His personality is such that.. ..hewill devour level 3 security.. ..and not even burp. He has opened up a shop of all kinds of biological virus. A special virus to kill Arabs. Another virus to suck the life out of Jews. It's unbelievable. -Sir, it's an emergency. What's going on? What's the problem? Why is everyone standing? Get back to your station! Sonali, move out ofmyway! Whatthe hell is going on? Move! The system is going to crash any moment. What's.. Viirus. system is back. Doctor. What is operation White Tiger? Two years back, we.. ..had sent our man to Paris. So.. ..that was our job? That's what we do. I will tell you.. ..that we had to build his reputation. His first operation was Paris. After Paris, therewas activity in Sudan and then we.. ..had to send him to Sudan. You have to kill Al-Mehmood. He's the most dreaded lSl Agent. And afterthis assignment.. ..you will gain such notoriety.. ..Doctor himselfwill come looking for you. Azaan, it's said that.. ..that the hand of Allah protects you. You need it. Thatwas it. Hewas set. They sniffed him out. Then.. ..Algeria. Who is.. ..Azaan Khan? Sir! Look at that? Wow! What a crisp shirt! You must've heard about the London bombings this morning. A Muslim patriot!Huh National Defense Academy's.. ..gold medalist. In the London Bombing's suspect list, there's just one lndian name. Aman Khan. Patriot gold medalist.. ..Azaan Khan's younger brother. This is not possible. Impossible! Hey, Sharma! This younger brother.. ..how did heturn out to be such a big terrorist? A terrorist's brother aterrorist. Since when are you operating your sleeper cell? Sharma.. This guy.. ..should win an oscar for his performance. What a.. ..facade of innocence! What is it, Lieutenant? Such a big secret.. ..you've managed to hide it verywell, isn't it? Your mother is an lndian. But your father was an Afghani. And sir has spent the first 11 years of his life.. ..in his country. Yes, I had.. ..forgotten. I had forgotten. Afghanistan. Do you know the difference between Yashoda and Devki? This land has nurtured me. And lndia is my country. Is Aman alive? Azaan believes so. Drink some water. Aman. Your Aman.. ..has disappeared after the London bombing. What evidence do you have against Aman? Evidence? What is that? He must have already been issued aticket. Directly to Guantanomo Oneway. ClA interpol. FBl, Ml-6, MOSSAD. All ofthem are looking for him desperately. This is all a lie! Neither was Aman concerned with god.. ..nor a mosque or a madrassa. He had only one dream. Oxford. He has worked really hard to get there. Whywill he become a terrorist? Because your father taught him that. What are you staring at? Don't you feel like hitting me? Why not? Here. Hit me! Hit me! Just as I thought. Coward! Mumma's boy! Congratulations! Good job. Really, great! You guys have broken every known protocol in the book. So.. ..both ofyou are on the line. Look, why is it so difficult to understand? Azaan was our best option! Their language, culturewas in his blood. And even if it hadn't been so.. ..even then his fervour was enough for us. Reports have come that.. ..Aman is in Waziristan. But what can we do. Nothing at all. And anyway.. ..whywill the lndian government.. ..bother about an Afghani terrorist? I can do anything to find Aman. Look.. The intention is.. ..really noble but.. ..don't be a fool. Hitting me in this room as onething. But that place is different. That place is a land ofwar. Where your kith and kin are less human.. ..and more animal. There.. ..you will witness aworld.. ..that will make your blood boil. You might save every inch of your bodythere but.. ..your soul will be dead.. ..that you will never be ableto hide or heal it. Think about it. Wiill you be able to do it? It is said that I have Allah's hand protecting me. For your sake, dear Sharma and Pandey. I really hope.. ..that.. ..he has the hand of Allah protecting him. I think they are planning something very big in Europe. Thank you. He is my best customer. Always pays me big money. Sir Omar. Hello, how are you? Good. Thank god. Good. Tell me, who do you have for me? I will give you my best man. I will haveto test him! But you never tested any of my men before. I didn't have a job likethis before. Where will I find him? Waziristan. Waziristan. Very pleased! Nice meeting you. Have you ever met him? Who? Who? The Doctor. I had the honour of talking to him once on the phone. When? Just before London bombings. London? Doctor! Who did you think masterminded the bombings? Osama? What's going on? He is ready now. I tortured him for three days. He is a tough cookie(guy). He's ready then. He'll bethere in two days. Good luck! Quiet! Keep him talking. Track the call, people. C'mon! Are you alive? They're sending me to Poland(Krakow). Azaan, lndia is under attack. We don't have much time. Thethreat is biological. It's a virus. Azaan, Sharma here. The man called Doctor.. ..we'veto stop him at any cost. -Aman! We havetraced Sofiya in Paris. Please sit down. Your brother is dead. I was called to identify the body. Height 172 cms. O positive. I said that he is Aman Khan. They accepted. I'm not interested in being a terrorist's girlfriend. I was tired! Forthe past two years, l have been looking for Aman. I don't believethat he is guilty. Whether you accept it or not.. ..the Aman thatwe loved.. ..is dead. He has chosen his path. Forget him. Anyway, you won't be ableto look for him. It's god's will.. ..that wewill cross paths once again. "May I get a letter of blessings." "By saying.." "..god's name." "May I get the salutation ofkindness." "By saying.." "..Bismillah." "Bismillah." "Bismillah." "Bismillah." "Bismillah." "lt started with your name." "ltwill end with your name." "Bismillah." "Bismillah." "Bismillah." "Bismillah." "Difficulties became easier." "All the obstacles have been removed." "Oh god!" "Oh god!" "Oh god" "The ray of hope got lit." "Hope grew within." "May I get your embrace." "May I get your embrace." "By saying Bismillah." "Bismillah." "Bismillah." "Bismillah." "Bismillah." Come up to the terrace, brother! Imad. I am Malak So you can throw a punch ortwo. Fine. But show us what you came here for. How good are you at blowing things up? Good. But you will just have 45 seconds there. But whatever it is.. ..you taught the foreigner a lesson. Are you a Pakistani? Yes. And you? -Afghani. What are you doing here? You're very direct in your questions. I'm.. ..a suicide bomber. I came here to become a terrorist. Evil! The madness ofjihad was driving me. So I came hereto sacrifice myself. Things that I could never understand myself. I came hereto teach others. Destiny got me here. Now, what is right or wrong.. ..whosefight is it? And which fools are fighting? What difference does it maketo me? This war and jihad.. ..right and wrong.. ..I have made a cocktail out ofit and gulped it down. But what's with you? Looking at you, seems like.. ..you're very sad within. What difference does it make? No problems. It's said that.. ..ifyou save an innocent man.. ..it amounts to saving the entire mankind. Let it be said, one day I will save you. You wait here. Anybodythere? Bad lift! Check your computer. Threat is real. Activate interpol. The packet is clean. Sir, what you're about to see is very.. ..disturbing. What is theworst case scenario? Sir.. God forbid, if among the general population.. ..this virus leaks. Then within 24 hours.. ..this virus.. ..will affect 12 percent ofthe population. And within 48 hours.. ..15 percent. And so on. The strain ofthis Ebola virus.. ..has been specially formulated. The original strain has been tampered with. And what we have now.. ..is the weapons grade version. And the cure? According to our latest research, there.. ..is a Naquib Mahfouz. He's a famous scientist overthe world.. ..who has done maximum research on finding the cureto the Ebola virus. This is his picture. -Where will we find Mahfouz? It's been a while since I met the Doctor. Who is Doctor? Ex-ClA. Are we surprised? Sir, he's a strange man. ClA, Ml-6, MOSSAD.. He has written the dictionary for all. Infact, the RAW in lndia.. ..its A-B-C arethe gift ofhis corrupt mind. Brilliant! Undercover operation, rendition act.. ..it's a brilliant act ifyou've observed! But it is not being used in lndia. Else, wewould've kept Kasab in the jail.. ..and fed him gourmet cuisines, shame on us! Anyway, America's biological weapon.. ..he is the man behind it. The entireworld knows that lsrael.. ..has the most advanced.. ..biological weapon programme. He is the creator and everything.. ..behind it, sir! He's a cheat! Nobody knows his name. He gives the formula, ..operates smartly and.. ..then wraps up everything.. ..and disappears. Try finding him.!! The ClA has left no stone unturned trying to find this doctor. We believe that wherever he is.. ..he's their special guest. owns private limited companies and.. ..has sent us this gift. So what's RAW's plan? One of our agent.. - One agent? What can one man do? Any aggressive movewe make at this point.. ..will blow our agent's cover and I can't jeopardize this operation. Morethan half of Europe's police.. ..must be on his payroll, sir. Tiill we are unsure of his next plan or clue.. ..we can't so anything. We're helpless! Atleast, Mahfouz.. ..he has the cure to Ebola. Let's get to him! This apartment is clean. Check your source. Twenty minutes. Tiimeto go. Second floor, Van Gough. 71.5 million dollars. In 1998.. ..this picture.. ..was sold at 71.5 million dollars. In the list ofthe most expensive paintings in theworld.. ..this stands third. 1.1 million. Hitler killed 1.1 million Jews.. ..nearby Auschwitz. Numbers, numbers, numbers. What's in a numbers? The explosion that you.. ..were supposed to do in 45 seconds. You completed it in 43 seconds. What's in a numbers? No flash allowed! Sorry. Peoplewearing cheap shoes.. ..must be shot. You tell me. What's the purpose.. ..of your life? You're intelligent. You must've figured it by now that.. ..only I havethe answers to my questions. Lives of people like you.. ..are aimless. Boring. The purpose of your life is miniscule. You're born and you die. It doesn't make any differenceto anyone. You'll have nothing in your hands, neither your story.. ..nor your destiny. But if you conjoin your purpose in life with mine.. ..then your life will become meaningful. You.. ..who claims to be protected bythe hands of Allah. I was chosen. The universe has chosen me. My lifewas at crossroads. On one side.. ..a life of slavery wherethe masters.. ..would profit. On the other side.. ..I am the master.. ..and l.. ..have the power to changetheworld. Do you laugh? Learn how to! It's better people fear you than.. ..Iove you. Shoot him! Doctor.. ..never forgives mistakes. Do it! Professor Mahfouz. I'm a big fan of yours. You.. ..and l.. ..are connected. I love killing people. And you always wish to save them. You're old-fashioned, that's why. You.. ..have made me god. Earlier, I just had the devil. Now, you have given me.. ..a sword to kill that devil. The cure to Ebola. Ebola is perfect. You see.. ..if an over-populated country like lndia.. ..has to be destroyed. Which weapon will you use? Which weapon? No idea? You're such a big scientist. But you're very foolish, brother. Biological weapon. One potent virus.. ..that will turn every lndian.. ..into a suicide bomber. Think! Think of the beauty behind this thought. One billion.. ..suicide bombers. Thewar has changed. So will theweapon, professor. I alone.. ..have made this age into.. ..an age of proxywars. I'll miss you professor. But I'm afraid that.. ..you will not be alive.. ..to witness all ofthis. Do you have a cigar? I don't smokethis cheap variety. You're very keen on changing theworld, doctor. Interesting. Very interesting! I'm very fond of psychology. It's my favourite subject. I like specimens like you. This diseased mind ofyours. It's very entertaining. Money, power.. ..all these things that you want. This hunger that can never be satiated. There are many theories on this. Onethat fits you well. It goes like this. Men like you are not ableto satisfy your women. Especially in bed. Where it takes fervour to satisfy the woman. You need the drive.. ..which lacks in impotent men like you. Your impotence starts bothering you. You feel ashamed ofyourself! You feel disgusted! Suicide bombers, proxywar. Why do you need to do all this? You could've just taken a viagra. Life would be worth living.. ..not killing. Take him away. After Mahfouz's death.. ..India's remnant hope.. ..will also die. Bytheway, you have come a long way.. ..Agent Azaan Khan. Hello! Azaan, this better be good. Else everyone is going to be in trouble. For the concluding part ofthe performance.. ..please come back tomorrow. This story is mine. This story.. ..is mine. It's a story about my life. I've always known your story. You're the good brother. This story how will it end? How will it end? Come back tomorrow. Come, let's go! Good morning! Where are you travelling to, sir? Mumbai. Why did you do this to me? Why did you do this to me? Why did you do this to me? Why did you do this to me? Why did you do this to me? Why did you do this to me? Where am I lost? I don't know. Will you find me? Will you find me? How will our stories end.. ..sometimes wewonder? Whilewe wonder, we forget.. ..we're making our own choices. Our own paths. One karma at a time. Our stories and how theywill end.. ..is in our hands. "Beautiful! Beautiful!" "Beautiful! Beautiful!"

Yes, it's possible. Zahra was in such a village then. Mahfouzwas theretoo. Mahfouz had tested his cure on everybody but.. ..it only worked on Zahra. Wow! Zahra has the cureto Ebola, Sharma. That's fantastic news, Azaan. Look! The girl and the sand artist.. ..don't let go ofthem at any cost. Have I made myself clear? Azaan! Well done! This is no cure to Ebola. What did you send us? Itwas nothing but plain water. In twenty four hours.. ..find a real antidote. Orthe deal is off. And so is your head! Professor Mahfouz. I feel like killing you once again. I'm guilty of professor Mahfouz's death. I'm responsible for his death. Never knew my parents. Dr. Mahfouz is all I had. He's all we had. - Can I have a coke? He saved my sister's life. Do you still think I'm the good brother? It's not safe here anymore. We need to go. Zahra! Come here! Zahra! Why is Zahra in danger? The cure for Ebola is Zahra. It's her blood. Zahra!? That's why Dr. Mahfouz has sent me here. Come, let's go! I'm Aman's culprit. I'm guilty. But what happened to Aman.. ..will not happen to Zahra. I will not let anything touch Zahra. I won't let her down. I know. From the moment I saw you.. ..I knew.. I've been waiting for you mywhole life. "l feel you know that I love you so." "Why are my nights so sleepless?"

Butthe Doctor.. ..he has special plans for me. You could not meet your loving brother. But don'tworry. Be assured that you were on the right path. After the London bombings.. ..Aman became Doctor's pet. But now what is the difference between Aman and Azaan? Both of you are ofthe same kin. Both killers. You're the good brother. You're good! And.. ..Afreen. Viirgin? Move! "With thefingers of the soul.." "..you sketched a picture." "ls it an image made of sand?" "Or is it my life?" "You've healed my wounds."

Do you even know why you want to kill me? What difference does it make? I don't care, man! Yes, you do. Deep within.. ..you'retrying to run away from yourself. Right and wrong, war and jihad. You were calling it a cocktail, weren't you? Now the intoxication is fading away. I can see it in your eyes. Your conscience has started pricking you now. Our life is not so simple, Azaan. My life.. ..is not so happy. You had said.. ..that saving one innocent man.. ..is like saving the entire mankind. Simple. The virus has reached lndia. I just know one address. 546, Lakshmi Mansion. That girl also.. ..has been taken to Hong Kong. Global Corporation. And one more thing. Who is going to benefit from lndia's destruction? Pakistan? brother! From now on.. ..you're one of us. You will have four diplomatic immunity.. ..wherever you go. ClA, RAW, lnterpol. None of them can touch you! Cheers! Cheers! I need a room. How many nights? -One night. 1 90 dollars. Put him through. Global Corporation. Hong Kong. I'll need backup. Azaan, don't worry. We'll do our best. Sir.. We need permission to infiltrate China. Menon. You know that I can't give you that permission. But this time.. ..you don't need my permission. Good luck! Brother are you ok? Stay away from me! Whats wrong with you! Have you lost it! Tell me fast! - I don't know where he is. No, I'll tell you! Room no. 205! Where's the girl? Is he dead? Yes. Looks like you're dead inside. I'll do you a favour. I'm going to kill you. Whatwill you kill a dead?! Tracking the location, sir. Ear piece. GPS tracker. -Yeah. You're all set, sir. -Thank you. Sorry aboutAfreen. Azaan, it is the way ofnature. ..that each time god's creation has been threatened.. ..to be annihilated and there rises a man.. ..with the power and the selflessness.. ..to preserve his creation.. We havethe location, sir. Azaan! Savethe country. Therewill not be a darker day in the history of lndia. The menace of Ebola virus has reached the common people. On one hand, the count of infected people is rising. On the other hand is a bitter truth.. ..that there's no cureto Ebola. There's no antidoteto it. This dangerous virus.. -..is very grave and hopeless. There's no wayto control this pandemic. It threatens to be the biggest catastrophe in the history oflndia. Kolkata, Mumbai, Agra and.. ..New Delhi are in critical condition. There's no known cure for Ebola. The situation in the country is very grave and hopeless. There is no way to control this pandemic. It threatens to be the biggest catastrophe in the history of lndia. Their crude home-made detonators.. ..havethe Ebola virus attached to them. And yes. Agra's Taj Mahal. Kolkata. Kolkata, two locations. Howrah station and New Market. In Delhi, I have DP, Red Fort and the Metro. The Metro! All the stations. I need Mumbai on the line. Sir, Zahra is our only hope. The pharmaceutical company.. ..are convinced that they can come up with an Ebola vaccine.. ..with her blood sample. And sir, I know that you know this but.. ..panic and fear psychosis setting in. I'll handlethat. Thank you. Azaan do you realize What you have done?! I have quit running away dueto fear. And now.. ..the gun is in my hand. Azaan Khan! You're very stubborn. I hadn't got lost. Why did you go in search of me? Enough, Aman! Enough? Enough? This is just the beginning. Azaan Khan, I'm your disciple. Have you forgotten your reality? I was just twelve years old. I was angry because l saw my family being killed. I made myself and you the victim of that madness. And have you made that madness the purpose of your life? Grandfather was mad. Instead of fighting for Taliban, he fought against them. Hetook everyonewith him! And the punishment forthat.. ..how long arewe going to give it to theworld? Till when arewe going to punish ourselves? Tiill when? You and Zahra have to leavethis place. It's time to move on. Pick up the phone. Call your men and tell them that security has been breached. Send in Platoon 27. ..is standing in front of me. My lifewas at crossroads. On one side was other language.. ..their slavery.. ..and their profit. On the other hand.. ..I was my own master.. ..and my power to changetheworld. You were always weak, Azaan Khan. It's time to move on. No.. One deadly virus ofwhich we had heard only in films till date. But we've got news that it's spreading in lndiatoo. Okay. Count 1000,2000, 3000 and open your eyes. Okay? - I'm scared! Don't be scared. Just think about her. Azaan, what are you doing? Azaan! Pandey! I won't be able to stop them any further. Don't be mad. We're almost there. Azaan, what are you doing? Azaan! 1000! 2000! 3000! What is operation White Tiger? Sir, who is Azaan Khan? - There's news about China's.. ..involvement in this. - Is this truethat a RAW officer has saved.. ..India from Ebola virus? Ebola, China.. ..one lndian is enough to fight them all. It's a nice story. But just a story. It's nottrue. Jai Hind! With Zahra's blood samples one effective vaccine has been made. And now lndia's every pharmaceutical company is making it. He fought like a lion. Tiill his last breath he kept fighting like a lion. That one man saved his country. "With thefingers ofthe soul.."
