Since when are you like this? Since when am I like what? Why are you saying it's the last beer I'm getting from you? Pauli, I haven't forgotten the 170 euros. And that's just for the last 2 weeks. I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm not talking about what I've given you ove the last 2 years. I'm just talking about the last 2 weeks. - You holding that against me? Why, isn't it my right? I mean, OK, maybe you're not my real dad, Whether I'm your dad or your stepdad is irrelevant. The fact is that you owe me 170 euros from the last 2 weeks Can I have it? - You didn't give it to me in cash. Can I have my money please? - You know I'm broke. You're always broke. - Not always. You're always broke. - I am not. You know why you're always broke? Because you don't give a shit. Because I lost my job? Because you lost your job? And why'd you lose your job? It definitely wasn't my fault. No, it's never your fault, Pauli, it never is. I don't give a fuck where you get the money, but I'm getting my 170 euros for the past 2 weeks. And that's a matter of honor. Hi! How ya doin'? What's your problem, man? We were out drinking and you owe me money. I don't think so. We had a few drinks... - I don't even know you.

I ain't got nothing. - C'mon, asshole. And your treads? What about them? - They're nice. What do you want? - Your treads. You're crazy! Fuck you, man! You bastard! Ladies and gentlemen, how does a job interview start? What is the first thing you do? You sit in the waiting room. The boss is inside, you're waiting, and the key thing is to wait respectably. That means sitting up straight, not slouching in your chair... You can't sit up fast enough when the boss comes - suddenly. Waiting respectably is key. Never forget that you are responsible... for the climate at the job interview. You are responsible for the harmony. And you are responsible for the outcome of the interview. Therefore follow our motto. Always remember... F. O. A. D. Flattery, obsequiousness, and deference. Smile and you'll see how this creates harmony. F. O. A. D. One more bit of advice for the future: Keep practicing! Look at the Olympic athletes who have won gold. It's not just talent, it's practice, practice, practice. You do that too! So remember: F. O. A. D... . and practice, practice, practice! Cleaning is very important... for sanitary hygiene in restroom facilities. That's why it's very important to work carefully and thoroughly. What we clean ranges from lime deposits... to fecal residues. And here, of course, there are germs... or the potential danger of catching germs That's why we must work according to certain systems... or work procedures. Please note the use of the sponge cloths... for specific areas. Here we employ two different colors. Red is for the WC and urinals, and yellow is for the other washroom areas. This includes faucets, sinks, and mirrors. This is necessary to prevent... the germs or microorganisms on the red sponge cloth... from being contaminated with the areas... in constant contact with the employees' hands. It is important to recognize these zones by the color coding... and the pictograms... and to apply the right sponge cloth. Mrs. Jovic, you see an ad posted by a cleaning company... and think: That's exactly what I'm looking for. You want to call and make an appointment. What's important is... that before you call, you need to think about your strengths, what you want, who you are. And don't forget: You are a winner. You can do it! Before you dial, say this: "I can do it, I can do it, I can do it." You call me. I'm the cleaning company. Alright? Let's practice that. Cleaning company. Hello? I'm the cleaning company... - No, you're not a cleaning company... I'm Mrs. Jovic. You want a job as a cleaning lady. - Yes. Try it again, I'll pick up the phone again. Cleaning company. Hello? I am Mrs. Jovic Milica. I want work as maid. Maybe you should write down what you want to say. Or think it out clearly first. I don't understand you on the phone. Should I come over?

That was perfect. That was perfect? OK, I'm glad. I'm a winner, I'm a winner, I'm a winner... Yes, but much more gently. And what do we never do? Look. Never do this! It goes without saying, right? You know dog? Dog. You understand? You pet a dog like this, never like this. Same thing here. Next, it's got teeth. Teeth. And they're dusty and dirty too. Look at me! You understand me? Good. Now take this... and try to clean the teeth! Please show me. - I knew it. Hold it, because if it falls, I'll be really mad. Then it'll be broken. The only way to do it is just gently go in here... And yeah, yeah. Not "oh, oh!" Like this, if you can't do it, it'll never get clean. Try it! Show me! But hold it tight! Down here... No, no, no. You have to hold it here. Push? A little... No, not like that. That's no good. We said like this... Upwards a little. and then downwards. Hold it! Then inside. Or you won't get the dust out. Am I talking too fast? - A little.

It was a great job. Here it is, the special job for the Ukraine. This? Holy shit. A real Methuselah! For them it's good enough. Only the finest for the Russkies and Yogos. Holy shit.

I'm not a dictator, I'm just explaining the job to you. Yeah, but that wasn't the job... If you're good, you can work more... and have money for a change. I just don't like you hitting on other women. You're living with my mama... How can a young guy be so conservative? At your age I shagged everything. Not me. You know I'm not like that. - That's your mistake. Why mistake? - That's why you're always so grumpy. I've got other values. I'm not just looking to get laid. - What are your values?

A man to marry? Why you ask? A little more respect, cleaning lady. I not understand. A husband would be practical. I not need husband. Then it will be difficult to stay here. Yes, difficult. But a young blond thing like you always finds a man. What is this? Poop? Shall I throw it away? Who was it? Who was it? Did you see? Who throw away? Njet. We have to look for him. C'mon! Hansi! Stop! Where is your diaper? Let's see. What if I don't have one? - Did you take it off? Did you throw your diaper away? - No, it wasn't me, I swear. You didn't? - No. You threw your diaper away. - It wasn't me. Apologize. Say you're sorry! - I'm sorry, but it wasn't me. It wasn't you? Alright. I believe you. Koller! What? Why do you think I'm here, huh? What? Why am I here? You dumped your diaper in the hall. What? You threw your dirty diaper in the hall. Me? - That's not funny. It wasn't me. - Yes it was.

Give me your teeth. Open up. The top ones too... Let go! What is this? Did you use super glue? Can you believe this? You know I take your teeth away sometimes. Incredible! Give me a hand. OK, today we're going to fast. Pauli, stop here! Here? Yeah, slow down. Let's see if you're a man or a wimp. Don't start with that shit again. Scared to go in alone? Are you kidding? - You're a stud, aren't you? You think I'm a sucker? You're a stud! - You go! I don't need to. What am I doing here? I'll deduct 20 euros from your dept. Fuck your 20 euros. You go!
