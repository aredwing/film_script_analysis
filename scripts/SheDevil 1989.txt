Who need all the help we can get. Like me. Tonight my husband is taking me... To a very fancy affair... So I'm going to do whatever it takes to look great. Sometimes you just have to pull out all the staff. Yet another magnificent miniseries... Based on the passionate prose of... The reigning Royal Highness of romance... Her Majesty Mary Fisher. At the tender age of 34... She has already penned over 30 novels! These steamy stories have sold in the millions... Affording Mary a lifestyle... Even her wealthiest heroine would envy. Here, in her lavish Long Island Palace... Mary lives in the lap of luxury. Passion! Excitement! I think that's important in a long term relationship. And that's what I think women find from my novels, a... They find ways to... Make their men feel... Important and comfortable... So that he knows that he is... The man... You know, so there's no confusion. Ever the faithful daughter... Mary is never too busy to visit with her mother. Who convalesces in style... At the Golden Twilight rest home. Mrs. Francine Fisher is the proud matriarch... Of the Fisher clan. Champagne, caviar and dashing men. Sit down! Mary Fisher... Takes a moment to reflect on her writing philosophy... Mr. Patchett... I got your wife on line three. Hello, Ruth! Hi, honey! How's my favorite accountant doing today? Oh, I'm swamped, my secretary quit... I'm going out of my mind... I'm trying to break in a new girl... Oh, well, I just called to tell you... How excited I'm about the party tonight! Ruth, I'm warning you! It's going to be very boring. A bunch of people I don't really even know. I just want to do some networking... Trying to round up some new clients... I don't think it's... Worth your time to drive all the way into the city. Oh, I don't mind! We haven't been out together for so long! Okay, Ruth. Don't say I didn't warn you! I got to run, okay sweety? Bye, bye! Bye, Bob! How did you get here? Oh, I took the Concorde. It was a little cramped. Oh, I'm so sorry! Oh, my God! It's you! I don't believe it! - Oh, I'm so sorry! - You've ruined my... Ruth, what are you doing? Bob, I just spilled my wine... On the famous author Mary Fisher! I have read all of your books! - That's very nice! - Ruth, why don't you go get... Some salt and some Perrier to remove the stain? Hurry, honey, hurry! Salt and Perrier! A man... Familiar with a woman's domain... I like that! It's just that my wife is always toppling things. - She's a bit clumsy. - That's your wife? - Too bad! - Yeah... It's too late! That stain has already set. Why don't we just cover it up? I insist that you send the bill for the dry cleaning. I'm sorry. It's very gallant! Now I need another drink, Mr.? I'm Patchett, Bob Patchett. Mr. Patchett. Hey, can I have some salt and Perrier? I just knocked my wine on Mary Fisher. You know, the famous author? What is it exactly that you do, Mr. Patchett? - I'm a financial consultant. - Really? Yeah! Oh, I'm filled with awe... For men who know how to handle money! I can't even balance my own checkbook! Doesn't your accountant do that for you? Should he? The good ones do. Actually, Miss Fisher... I'm moving heavily into artists management. I like to be around creative types. I find it very... stimulating. Stimulated accounting sounds... Very interesting! Tell me more, Mr. Patchett. I refuse to divulge any more information about myself... Unless you call me Bob. All right! If you promise to call me... Mary. All the little families... The mommies and daddies and... Their little children... Tucked away for the night! How lucky they all are! It's so kind of you to take me home. Absolutely no problem! Now, Ruth, be careful. I need to drive from here, okay honey? Shouldn't we take her to the door, Bob? Oh, that's all right, Miss Fisher, we live just arond the block. There's no sense in making an U turn, right sweety? No, we still have such a long way to go. It's another hour to Hamp... Hamptons! Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Are you sure I'm not putting you out? Don't be silly! 75 miles is nothing! Bye, sweety! It was very nice meeting you, Ms. Fisher. It was nice. Bye, hon! Drive carefully!## Mary Fisher. Mary Fisher is pretty and rich... And thin! And writes best selling books about love. Fortunately... I can trust my husband. My God, this is fantastic! You should see my electricity bills. I'd love to! You have a moment? Garcia! I waited up for you. It wasn't necessary, grazie. You may go to bed now. We'll be all right. Yes, ma'am. Would you care for a drink? I'd love one. Good night. Oh, yes! Good night! 'Buenas noches!' You've got one hell of a home office deduction, here! I don't know what you mean. Cognac? Sure! I just mean that everything in this room... From floor to ceiling... Including that... Courvoisier... Is a tax writeoff. Is that... Good? Yeah! It's great! I have not your head for money matters at all. I just find it all so terribly, terribly... Confusing. You see, I try to think only beautiful thoughts... Because then I think that the beauty will... Come out in my work. You must lead a very glamorous life, Mary. I suppose so, Bob... Sometimes sitting here... Day after day... Banging away at my keyboard... Writing can be so... So lonely. I guess you got to have a very vivid imagination... To write this romance novels, don't you? Yes, I do. But I also do a lot of... Research. " She entwined her limbs about him..." "As ivy may wrap itself around some massive pillar." "When his love nectar was spent..." "They drifted into the bliss of sleep." Maybe he had an accident and got amnesia. Don't be a jerk! If he lost his memory... The people at the hospital would just look in his wallet. And what if his car slipped off the road... And he got smashed into little bloody pieces? Stop talking like that! Andrew put that animal down! Your father drove someone home... And he probably just blew a tyre on the expressway. And it got late... Bob! Is that you? Come on, Fuzzy. Hi, honey! Where were you? Oh, you'll never believe what happened. I'm headed home on the expressway... And KABUM! The rear tyre blows up! By the time I got the damn tyre changed... It was so late... I figured I'd better check into a motel. You know, I certainly didn't want to fall asleep at the wheel. How're you doing, champ? Why don't you call me? Oh, you want me to call at 4:30 and woke up the whole house? Come on! Good morning, princess! Good morning! Boy, am I hungry! You are in a good mood this morning! By the way, I have got some great news! I've landed the Mary Fisher account! And that's just the beginning! With Mary Fisher as my star client... I'm not just an accountant, I am... Business manager! Daddy... Are we going to be rich? Right away, princess! - All right! - All right! My husband is having an affair with Mary Fisher! Ruth, how can you say that? I've always been totally honest with you. You are my best friend! What's going on between me and Mary is purely professional. I would never, ever do anything to hurt you and the kids. Come on, honey! Trust me! Mary Fisher, I hope your pink palace crumbles into the sea... I hope your delicate white skin breaks up in hives... And your shiny blond hair falls off at the roots! But meanwhile... I will watch... And wait. I will keep busy in taking care of our home. I will try to look attractive for my husband. Bob's just going into a phase... And when it's over, I'll be here. Ready and waiting for him. Mary Fisher, you are just a fling. A novelty, an infatuation. Bob doesn't love you! I love you! I know my husband better than you ever will, Mary Fisher. And I know what to do to win him back! "The art of winning back your man... Is easy with these surefire economical, sexy recipes. "The secret of Chicken Vol-au-Vent... Is a delicate, puff pastry. The perfect appetizer for this dish... Is a smooth, seductive, mushroom soup." Gross! Your father loves mushroom soup. We don't love it! We are eating too, aren't we? Yes, but tonight we want to make your father very happy. Why? So he'll stay at home? Was that... Was that for real or the wildest dreaming? If this is a dream... I don't ever want to wake up. Wow... I know! What are you doing now? Oh, what are you now...? What are you doing? I got to go home! Already? Yeah... Myr parents are coming home for dinner. I didn't realize that you were so domestic. Come on, I got to get home sometimes! No! You know you don't! You don't ever have to go back, Bob. We fell in love! It's no one's fault! It's not your fault. It's not my fault. I know when you married Ruth you... You did it out of for kindness, and pity... And I love you for that... But Bob now, please, please... Be kind to me! Be with me, stay with me, live with me! Mary... I want to but it's not that easy! I've got kids! But they have their mother! Ruth is blessed with those children... They're her pride and joy. It's not fair! What do I have? My all life is so empty! Don't you say that. You've got me! I'm tired of sharing you with her! Bob... I don't think I can stand that much longer... I want all of you! I know. Damn, if I know. Hey, daddy is home! Hi, daddy! Hi, princess! Are you sleeping here tonight? Of course I am, sweety pie! Your grandparents are coming over, we're going to have a nice family night. That ought to be unusual. Hey, Ruth, dinner going to be ready on time? Yes, yes, it will. Hey, you were supposed to be home an hour ago. I could have used some help. I'm sorry. I got stuck in a meeting. I'm going to jump in the shower. Oh, Jesus! Ruth! What the hell are you doing? Oh, please... Don't start now! My folks are going to be here soon. I'm not starting anything. I'm... going to weigh myself... Yap! No wonder you're upset! Nothing's ready... And they're here! They're early. They're always early! Cheese and crackers, that's it? The flans ought to be ready in ten minutes. I'm doing the best I can, Bob. Please don't embarrass me in front of my folks. What are you doing down there, son? - I can't find my gerbil. - Really? Well, let grandpa help you look for it! - Robin! - Got to be 'round here somewhere! There she is! I've got it, hon! - Are you okay, dear? - What's the matter with that woman? Herbie, are you under there? - She's clumsy as an ox! - Is it that time of the month? Herbie? I'm going to get back in the kitchen. Can I help you? Relax, mom. Ruth has got everything under control, don't you honey? Andy, find him yet? Certainly these romantic novels have universal appeal. They sell like crazy! Women... buy it. Ask Ruth. She's read everyone! Nicolette, will you clear the salad dish, please? Do I have to? You men don't understand. It's always up to the woman... To keep the romance in a relationship... I'm sure Ruth reads these books... For inspiration, don't you Ruth? We don't need books. Ruth and I have a terrific relationship. Always had, always will. Sure we have our problems... But it's a question of give and take. Once you understand that... The romance takes care of itself. Bob, that's so very sensitive coming from you! Ruth, I didn't know he was so sensitive! Oh, my God! Herbie! I'm going to barf! Ruth, what the hell is wrong with you? I'll go get a strainer. A strainer? That's a dead rodent! Take it off the table! - Bob, calm down! - Calm down? The woman is a walking disaster area! Why don't you get Mary Fisher to cook your dinner? Ruth, I warn you! She's his mistress, you know? Shut up, Ruth! You see what I have to put up with? I'll never forgive you for being so rude to my parents! Bob, don't be so mean to her! Mean? She's the one making my life miserable. I knew I never should've married her! Bob, the children! Nicolette and Andy, go up to your rooms, now, now, now! Bobby, Bobby, if you didn't love her, you shouldn't have married her. Yeah, she was pregnant, you made me! Marriage is never easy! With Ruth, it's not even possible! Come on, Brenda! We'll eat out. That's a good idea, since half your dinner is on the goddamn floor! I had every intention to save this marriage. I'm tell you something, Ruth. Life is made up of assets and liabilies. As a man I have four basic assets... 1: A home, that is my castle... 2: A family, that is loving and devoted... 3: A successful career that I worked very hard to maintain... And 4: The freedom to enjoy the fruits of my labor. But when it comes to liabillities, I have only one. That's you, Ruth! And I'm not gonna let you ruin everything I've worked so hard for! You're a bad mother... A lousy wife... And a terrible cook! In fact... Have you looked in a mirror recently? I don't even think you're a woman! Do you know what you are? You are a she-devil! Mary Fisher. Mary Fisher lives in a palace by the sea. She is pretty, and rich and thin! And in love with my husband, who's her accountant. I loved my husband... And I hate Mary Fisher! BOB's ASSETS 1. HOME 2. FAMILY 3. CAREER 4. FREEDOM He is cute, that kid. It blew up and then fell down. Oh, my God! Mom, what happened? Well... We had a little accident. What about our clothes? Gone. - What about my toys? - Gone. What about my tapes? Gone, everything is gone. Where are we going, Mom? Mom? Yes? I'm Mrs. Ruth Patchett. Children would like to see their father. Oh, please come in. Why don't you just go find your father. There's a door on the way, to the right. This place is cool! Andy! I found him! Hi, daddy... Who let you in here? Gracia?! Ruth, what the hell do you think you're doing? Andy, Nicolette, this is your new home... I'm sure you'll be very happy here. Ruth, you are really depraved! Someone get this strange woman out of here! Garcia! You take care, kids. And remember, no matter what... I love you both... Very much. Ruth! Ruth... If this is your idea of a joke... It's not funny! Do you have a satellite dish? Ruth! Ruth, take the children home! I can't. If you want to talk, we'll meet for lunch... But the children belong at home with their mother! You don't understand Bob. There is no home. What are you talking about? The house is gone. Burned down. - There's nothing left but ashes. - I don't believe you. Well, call the insurance adjuster, he'll tell you! Ruth! Ruth! Okay... Okay, Ruth! I'll give you a few days... Then you got to come back for the kids. Where can I reach you? I'm not coming back, Bob. They'll have a much better life here with you. Wait a minute, Ruth. Where are you going? I don't know, Bob. Into my future, I guess. Ruth! Ruth! Ruth! Goddammit! Ruth! Stop it! I will have to get used to being alone now. It's not easy for a mother... To be separated from her children. I'll bet Mary Fisher's mother feels the same way. Maybe I can help old Mrs. Fisher... Get reacquainted with her daughter. Buy a rose? A beautiful rose for a beautiful lady. But first... I will need a new name. The old are all the same. Allow them nothing! Take a firm line! Remember, they're no different than children. Are you used to children, Miss Rose? Yes. Good, then you'll feel right at home here. Oh, let me stress one thing above all else. You must report any damp or smelling beds immediately. - Do you mean... - Incontinence! Bed wetters have no place... In the Golden Twilight Home! Walk this way, please. Are they sedated? Our angels would rather sleep then be awake wondering why... Their families have thrown them away... You can understand that, can't you, Miss. Rose? Of course! Good afternoon, Mrs. Trumper... Oh, Mrs. Hooper, this is Vesta Rose... She's the new orderly. Hello! It's time for their medications. Nurse Hooper may be short, but she's very devouted. Been with me for years! You'll take your orders from her. Now go help her! Yes, Mrs. Trumper. That's it! Good girl. Not good? Here we go. Open up... Right! Okay, Mrs. Fisher... Open wide... - There we go. - How are you, Mrs. Fisher? You look very pretty today! All right now, Mrs Palmer... SEDATIVE MaxiLIFE Mary Fisher's mother has been enjoying a long untroubled sleep... It was time to wake her up! Come on! Give me the ball! Yeah! Go! Come on, Ms. Wolinski! Vesta, what is going on here? Oh, is it not wonderful? I know what you been doing! The vitamins! The workouts! It's against the rules! I'm going to report you to Ms. Trumper... And then you'll be sorry! Oh, I don't think so! I have been sorry my whole life... And by the looks of it, so have you! So you do whatever you want. But it's a shame now, Hooper... I always thought that women like us... Should stick together. Let's go! Catch that ball! She knew her body as if she'd had it for a millennium... And with an ease neither of them had ever, ever, known... He reached for her... Come Juliet, Fuzzy! Nub... No. Love... Button... Nicolette! Nicolette... Nicolette! Nicolette!! Nicolette! Nicolette! I'll call you back later. You don't have to scream! I asked you... 10 or 15 times not to... Play that thing... so loudly. And you damn know I don't approve that you're talking on that party line! There's nothing else to do around here. Hello! Mary, hi! What's going on out there? I just spoked to your publisher she's been trying to reach you. I know... The little Nicolette... Has been on the phone all day long! Paula is very upset! She says the new manuscript is two months overdue. You have no idea what I have to put up with around here! The noise, the bickering, the constant interruptions. I can barely even... concentrate! And let alone create! Mary, Mary, the kids have been through a very emotional experience... They need time to adjust to the new environement. You're the stepmother, you got to make them feel at home, Mary! Help them! Yes, I know! Andrew! Andrew, what are you doing? Andrew! Andrew, you leave little Juliet alone! Mary, what's on? Your child and that mongrel are molesting my dog. Andrew, did you hear me? Andrew... Throw that stick away right now! Right now! Mary... Mary! Mary! It's time for your medication, Mrs. Fisher.. This is the stupidest piece of trash I have ever read! How are you today, dear? How the hell do I look? - Better, dear, much better. - Well, I'm bored to death! Folk can go crazy in a place like this! Well, how about some nice hearthy beef barley? Oh, you know I hate this slop! You think you can slip me a beer? Mary Fisher, any relation? My daughter! - Oh how nice! - She's a slut! Bitch keeps me in this dogpound... While she lives the life of a princess... In her goddamn mansion! Why, that doesn't seem fair! Yeah I ought to drop in on her one day... That'd scare the shit out of her. You have rights. If you wanted to go see your daughter nobody could stop you. I'm too old! You are a mature and vibrant woman... And don't you let anybody tell you anything different. Yeah? I suppose I could go on Sunday afternoon! I'll put you on the train myself. And I'll even call ahead to make sure the butler knows you're coming. Butler? I'll bet there's hanky panky there! Well there's only one way to find out! - All right? - Come with me. All right! - Here we go! - Okay. - Coming your way! Lift it up! Kill her! Allright! Trash her! Come on! Yes! Kill her again! Crush her! Go! Yes! What a pigsty! Andrew! Nicolette! In this house we do not eat in the living room! That's my blouse! You're wearing my blouse! I have no clean clothes! Do the laundry, then! I'm sure your little brother will be happy to help you. I don't know how. - Oh, yeah! - Andrew, don't... Ever kick me again! - Come back here! - That's it! Now, go upstairs and clean your rooms. Tell the maid to do it! You shit! - Shit! - Ute! Ute! - Shit! - Ute! Ute, the children... Don't seem to have any clean clothes! Do you think that you could pos... Fuzzy has just shit all over the carpet! Or perhaps Miss Fisher would like to clean that up? And Ute will do the laundry? No, no, no, that's all right! Where is Garcia? In the swimming pool, where else? Garca! Garca! Garca, what the hell do you think you're doing? I'm not really sure. Lately I haven't been able to perform my... Usual services. Well! You are still the butler... So get in there and get to work! I may be the butler... But I'm not the maid! Would somebody please get the door? Would somebody please get the goddamn door? Scuzzy... Fuzzy. Get away! Get away! - Mother? - Hello, Your Royal Highness! You better pay for the taxi. What are you doing here? Fancy schmancy! He's cute! How much do you pay him? I'll bet she makes you earn every penny, huh? Where are the children? They're getting ready Hey, kids! Dinner is ready! Bob, we don't shout at the dinner table. Here they are! Oh, don't you look... What's the matter with your clothes? You did the laundry! I... Think something's wrong with that machine. Here she is! Where the hell is the chow line? Good evening, Mrs. Fisher... Andy, wont you get out of... sit in another chair. Thanks, Gomez! It's Bob! Wathever! Why the hell didn't anyone call me for dinner? Well, we thought that you were having a little nap, mother. We didn't want to disturb you. Nap? I was in the toilet the last half hour... I've got... turboconstipation! She's great! Yeah... Well... Here we're all together... Having a nice family dinner. We certainly are! Pretty fancy, eh kids? What is it? It's Potage Crme de Cresson. What's that? It's French for dog puke. Actually it's cream... Of watercress. Well, it's delicious. You know Mrs. Fisher... I haven't told you what a wonderful daughter you've got. You did a terrific job in raising her. You'd never know with the way she treets me... The 'famous writer' over there... You'd think a 41 year old woman... Would have learnt to appreciate her mother! You'd think that her mother would appreciate... The very expensive nursing home her daughter... Pays for! Mary, I... I thought you were 34! Ah, she's 41.... I got the birth certificate to prove it! Don't listen to her! She's getting senile... Bullshit! I remember everything! I remember when you were just a teenager! I'm not interested in what you remember! Will you shut up! You may clear the first course, Garca. How's your lunch, Hooper? Adequate, thank you. Try one! Tell me something, Hooper. How long have you been here? - Twenty-two years. - Really? You must like it here. Well, I... Can't say that I do, but... I guess it's what I'm used to. Yeah, well, you can get used to anything, if you have to. But I'm not going to stay here... Forever. Hooper, there's over 55.000 dollars here! Well... I don't really have any expenses... Almost everything I make goes into the bank! What are you going to do with all this money? I haven't given that much thought! Hooper, money has no value if you don't put it to good use! What would you do with this much money? Oh, I could think of something! Hooper! Vesta! This, is long-term leaking! How long has this been going on? I didn't want to tell you... Poor Mrs. Fisher, she... No excuses! You're fired! Hooper, get some disinfectant and clean down this bed! Now! Where is Mrs. Fisher? Mother, your train leaves at 3, shouldn't you be packing? Can't wait to get rid of me, huh? Let's... Not get paranoid, shall we? How do you do? I'm... so thrilled... that People Magazine... Wants to do an article about me. Oh, it's long overdue, Miss Fisher... Mary. Please! Thank you! Chris would like to take some pictures... Of your beautiful palace. By all means. Garca, what is this? Tea time as usual, ma'm. No... No, No, No... Let me start with a real tuffy! Some critics charge that your books... Are nothing more than soft core porn... For bored housewifes. Well, those critics are usually men. It's silly! My... Books reflect my own experiences... Of lovemaking as sacred and beautiful. Something... Special... To be shared and treasured. You! Phone call! - Would you excuse me? - Sure! The issue, here, is bladder control. Look, I said I'll pay extra for the inconvenience. Incontinence is more than an inconvenience. Your mother is no longer welcome here. Well, what am I supposed to do with her? What I've done with her for the past 10 years! Put up with her! But I'm not... A nurse! She doesn't need nursing! She needs T.L.C. What is that? A new drug? Tender, Loving, Care! Something that I'm sure you, as her daughter... Can provide. Goodday, Miss Fisher! Are you saying that she was promiscuous? Promiscuous? She was a teen-aged tramp! She couldn't get enough! She would do it anywhere, anytime, and with anyone! She got knocked up when she was sixteen! Really? Couldn't keep it though. She had to put that cute little baby boy up for adoption! A boy? Chris! Come here! Are you saying, there's a missing heir... To the Fisher family Royal Dynasty? Royal my ass! Her father was a kosher butcher from Hoboken. A lovely man! Now, where were we? So! Tell me about your son! Miss Fisher... Smile! My work at the Golden Twilight was over... So I appointed Mrs. Wolinski captain of the soccer team... And wished them all good luck. It was now time to move on to the next stage of my plan.... Rose! Stop! Vesta! Stop, stop! Stop, please! Thank you! What are you doing? I don't know! I thought... You might have a plan. Oh, I had plan all right... And I was glad to have Hooper as a partner. She was hard-working, loyal, honest... And eager to invest her money... Where it would do the most good. Come on, you got to use a little imagination here! Look at this! It got westerly exposure, beautiful views... I could get a fortune for it! The neighborhood is very hot! But, you seem like a nice couple of girls.... The place could use a woman's touch, so... I'll give you a good deal! What do you think? WHOLE BUILDING FOR SALE OR LEASE I was starting an employment agency for the unloved and the unwanted... Women like Hooper whom the world had thrown away. And I knew just where to find them. GET THE JOB YOU DESERVE! COME TO VESTA ROSE - TODAY - All these women needed was a little support... And encouragement to turn their lives around. They would become my own personal army. Ready for action when I needed them. You see, my husband just left me... And I got three kids. I've never had a real job before. Well, taking care of three kids sounds like a real job to me! Yeah... I'm sure you don't have anything for someone like me, but... I had nowhere else to go.... So I figured... What the heck! Well, do you have any office skills? No... But I did do all my husband's bookkeeping at home! See? Now, I'm sure we can find something for you. You be here tomorrow morning at 8:30 sharp. Thank you! Thank you so much! Welcome to Vesta Rose! Feeling useless? Think you have nothing to offer? Were you voted "Less likely to Success?" Then you're just the person we're looking for! Wether you're returning to the workforce...

Now that Prince Charming works late every night. Bob? Bob... This is... Bob, are you there? Can't you pick up? Honey, please, please, please, pick up! Bob? Bob? Is that you, just...? Darling? I was calling, and calling, and calling... Where were you? Sorry, honey... That freaking Jag blew a fan belt on the way in... Oh, I'm so pissed! You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking... That ride from the city is so long... It might be safer if I spent... A few nights... In the office. What do you think? I think that you should take a look at this! Jesus Christ! We're going to sue the bastards! Hold on, Mary, who are you going to sue? Your mother? No. I'll wring her scaly little neck. Okay, okay, we'll just look at the bright side... Even bad publicity is good publicity. We're going to need all the help we can get... When "Love In The Rinse Cycle" comes out. What... May I ask... Do you mean by that? I read the manuscript, frankly Mary, I'm worried. Why? Why? Why is everyone turning against me now? First Paula refuses to publish it! Now you tell me you hate it! I don't hate it... I just don't know why you strayed from the formula! Because I... If you don't know it, Bob... Am an artist! And ever since you came to my house... With the children my life has changed... And I must reflect that in my... writing. Mary... Let's, let's not exaggerate the significance of you writing, okay... We're not talking about art here. We're talking about a product! - A product?! - Yeah! When did I mention you know about literature, art, or creativity? After all you are merely... An accountant! Yes, but accounting can be very creative! Yeah, that's what our friends are telling me! Yeah! If I didn't keep my eye on the bottom line... You and all your artist friends wouldn't have a pot to piss in! You are so vulgar! So gross! How dare you insult my... Beautiful friends? Because that is the real world, Mary... So wake up and smell the cappuccino! No! - No! - Goodnight! Where are you going, darling? No! No! No, no, no, no! Sad Mary Fisher! She's learning that men who burn so hot for a mistress... Cool out fast when the mistress starts acting like a wife. Oh, Bob! Oh, darling! Aw, yes! Oh, yes! I love you! I think you really... Yes, I do! Oh, God! He is such an incredible lover! I mean, it's more than just sex! You have no idea how nice he is! Sounds like love. I don't know! Is he married? So he was, but... She ran off and left him with the kids! I mean, can you imagine it? Sounds a bit like she was a real nut, huh? Oh, that must have been tough on him! Yeah! He lives with someone now, but that's on the rocks! You know, it's just for showing you how he felt about me. What have you told him? This what's his name? Bobby. Have you told Bobby how you feel? Oh, I can't! I mean, it's not like that. He's so... I don't know... Important! But Olivia, so are you! You should tell him how you feel! Do you really think so? Why, you don't want him to think that you do... This sort of things all the time! No! But, I mean, I can't come right out and say... 'I love you, Bobby.' I mean... What if I scare him off or something? Oh, now you listen to me, Olivia! How could tell your man that you love him... Possibly scare him off? Oh, Bobby! Catch me if you can! Wait, where are you going? Come here! Come on, come on up on the desk! Up on the desk. I have an idea! We go for a ride! It's picture time! Goody! Say cheese! Oh, Bobby! It's so funny! And sweet, you know? This isn't just a fling for me, you know? What's that? I love you Bobby, I do! I really, truly, love you. I told him I loved him, and fired me! He accused me of... Of trying to sleep my way to the top. Aw, it sounds like he really took advantage of you! Yeah! You know, it's like you give men what they want... And then they don't want it anymore! I can't believe I trusted him! Well, maybe you were a little naive, but... He certainly seemed like a nice guy, an honest businessman... Honest? You got to be kidding me! He cheats his own clients! He does? How? Oh, he skims the interest off their accounts... And wires it to a bank in Switzerland. Ah, what a slime ball! It's not fair. Men get away with murder, you know! It seems like if you are a woman there's just no justice in the world. Well, I always found that... Justice serves those who serve themselves. Poor Olivia! She had learned something about life and love. But more importantly... She had learned the secret access code to Bob client's acconts... People who trusted Bob... Beyond the shadow of a doubt. How much shall I transfer, 20,000 dollars? More! 40,000? More! 100,000? Okay! Let's take out... 200,000 dollars! And transfer that to Robert Patchett, Banque Suisse... Zurich, Switzerland. It's not exactly like we were framing Bob... We were just making his thievery a little more obvious... You know, sometimes you just have to exaggerate things... In order to make people see the truth! Dreadful, embarrassing... Terrible, horriyfingly bad, bad, bad. Even those words don't adequately describe... Mary Fisher's new novel. This book simply chokes the reader's brain... Before he has even finished chapter one. Clearly this novel is but a waist... Of time, paper, ink and shelf space. This reviewer wouldn't shed a tear... To find his copy of "Love In The Rinse Cycle"... Lost in the garbage disposal. I hate to say "I told you so..." But... You just did, didn't you? Hello! Bills, bills, bills! Oh, here's a little something that should cheer you up! Like a fan letter! You know what I'm thinking? I think we should go on a little vacation, just you and me. Have some fun, go to the islands... I don't know... Have some Coco Loco some Pias Coladas... Just relax, recharge your batteries... God, I 'd love that! - What do you think, Mary? - You bastard! Mary! Mary! Mary... come back here! Please! You know you're the only woman I've ever been faithful to? Ute, where are you going? I took this job because I only had to cook and clean... For one person and one dog! Then I get the mother, the lover... His kids, their dog! Miss Fisher! Up with this bullshit I will not put! I quit! Oh no, no, no, no, no! Stop that! Stop it! Stop it, now! Take your filthy hands off her, Garcia! You're fired! Get out! Out of my house! I hate you! You go upstairs, young lady and take off my dress! You're not my mother! I said move! And you, young man... Mother, go sit down! To your room! And stay there! You're grounded! What's going on here? Bob! I'm taking back control of my life, Bob! As long as you're all under my roof... Things will be done my way... Starting now! Mary Fisher had decided to lay down the law! That's not a bad idea! Yes, I'd like the number for the Internal Revenue Service, please. Thank you. But I think some matters ought to be handled... By the proper authorities. - Mark. - Mary! - Great party! - Thank you! - I knew you would come! - Glad to see you! Mary! You look wonderful! Thank you! Mary... I'm glad to see you. What a success, my dear, everybody is having fun! I just want you to know that as far as I am concerned... You are still on probation. So, you should be nice... To my friends! - Hey! - Why, see there! - Can I bring you a fresh one? - No thanks! I'm enjoying your party, Your Highness! Going well! Attention, everybody! Everybody, quiet down! I would like to propose a toast... To the wonderful woman... Who put this fabulous party together... She doesn't know how much I appreciate her... And that's probably my fault... Because I don't tell her often enough. And so I'm going to tell her right now! In front of all of you good people. Mary, come on up here! - Come on! - Music guys! Come on everybody, give her a big hand! Mary... You are the abosolute best! And I'm the luckiest guy this room! It's a great life... And things are only going to get better. Toast to you, honey! Robert Patchett, I have warrant for your arrest! For what? For fraud and embezzlement. I can't imagine! But this is a private party! You can't just come... You have to leave! There must be some mistake! There's no mistake, Mr. Patchett. Will you please come with me? Sorry to spoil your party! Bye-bye, Bobby! Call Larry! Watch your head, sir. Be brave, darling! This would make a bestseller. How serious is it, Larry? 26 counts of fraud and embezzlement... We are looking at 200,000 to 300,000 dollars in fines... That's a lot of money! - I think we can handle it. - Plus... Two to five years in prison. That's crazy, Larry! You got to do something! Mary! Bob! The solution to your problem lies in two words... Pay off? No, Bob! Judge Phillips! Judge Phillips? I have learned that Judge Phillips will be hearing your case... And that is very good news! For not only is he my father's old golf partner... Judge Phillips tends to be very... Considerate towards white-collar criminals. Criminals? Who's talking about criminals? Larry, I'm no criminal! Of course you're not, Bob! Just relax, Bob! We know that... A considerable amount of your client's money was... Somehow transferred into your... Personal bank account in Switzerland. - Yes! - Our defense will claim... That a virus somehow crept into your computer... Causing a mistaken transfer of money. The idea is to chalk the all thing up to a software glitch! I love it! Plus, to ram home the idea that the whole thing was an accident... We can show that the largest transfer of money... Came from Mary's own account... We all know that was a mistake, right? Absolutely! Don't worry about a thing! Then I'm going to play two rounds with the judge... So we can all start doing the ground work. Are you sure this'll work, this computer virus affair? Bob, I don't get paid 350 dollars an hour to give bad advice! Okay! Mary, you've been great! How the hell did a bum like me... End up with a wonderful woman like you? Don't you dare touch me! You think I was born yesterday? Hey, hey! What is the matter? It's bad enough to steal from your own clients... But to steal from the very hand that feeds you! You heard what Larry said, it was the computer. Computers don't have Swiss bank accounts, Bob! Mary! I'm glad this has happened! Because now I can see the real you.... You greedy son of a bitch! I want you out of my life! Oh, and... you're fired! Patchett... Patchett..Patchett. It's judge Phillips. I sure can! Oh, it's no problem! For you, anything! Yes! The job is working out very well! It's just wonderful! I can't begin to thank you! Oh. I'm so glad to hear that, dear! Goodbye! This judge is a very expensive guy, look he loves to... Let me ask you, is there a conflict of interest... I'm asking you as a lawyer... Can we take him out to dinner after, go to Ruban D'Or? Well, better be Peter Luger. Fine! I'm buying... Absolutely brilliant! All rise! How do I look? You look great! How do you feel? Fine! Please be seated. Case number 64-84, People vs. Patchett. Honorable Judge Brown presides. It is true that the defendant has no criminal record... And is a well respected member of the community... But the fact remains that the defendant stole... Large sums of money from his clients. In doing so Mr. Patchett has... Not only broken a sacred trust... He has shaken the public's faith... In accountants, everywhere. This Court therefore will fine Robert Patchett... 250,000 dollars... And orders him to serve a prison term of... 18 months. She's... she's kidding, right? You promised me all would be okay! I'm really sorry, Bob. If we had Judge Phillips... No problem! Hey, why don't you hear to have judge... And all us together for a round of golf... I'll be free in, say, 18 months! Come on! Come on! Easy! - Easy! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Ruth! Ruth! Is that you? Ruth! It's my wife! Ruth! Where have you been? - All right, come on, let's go! - You got to help me! That's Ruth! Ruth! Help me! Poor Bob! I almost felt sorry for him! Almost! Mary Fisher no longer wants her palace by the sea. She doesn't love my husband anymore either... And these days... Bob is growing accustomed to a very different lifestyle. Hey, what's burning? My lasagna! Oh, shit! What the hell are you doing now, Patchett? I don't understand. I've only had it in for 20 minutes! You jerk! You put it in at 5,25 minutes when it's supposed to be at 3,50. Hey, I'm really sorry! You Patchett, you go a visitor! Get out of here! Hey, daddy! It's daddy! Nicolette, Andy, come here! I've missed you! I've missed you both! How are you doing? I count the days! Hello, Ruth! Hello, Bob! Thanks for bringing the kids. How are you doing? You look great! Thanks, you look good too. I'm all right, I guess! I got a lot of time on my hands. Look, I realize you and the kids have to have a lot to talk about... So I'll leave you alone. So long, Ruth, thanks again! Sure, Bob! Hey, Ruth! I get out in a couple of months. Maybe I can come visit, cook you all dinner! That'd be nice. Hey! Here you got, I made you some cookies. Give them a try! Be honest, tell me exactly what you think. - They're good, Dad! - Are you serious? - Yes... - Do you mean it? I was worried, I thought you may not like them! People can change. That's why you can't give up on them. Even Mary Fisher. We are here with... Mary Fisher. And she is the former romance novelist. Now, Mary has just written a new book... And this is something that is very different. It's called: 'Trust and Betrayal' And it's subtitled... A docunovel of love, money and skepticism. Thank you very much for joining us this morning! Thank you, Sally. It's very nice to be here. Now, let's see, this was about... A year and a half ago... That your last novel was published... - And it was... - A complete and utter flop! Yes! We may as well be blunt! But the new book has gotten... Fabulous reviews.... Yes, it's has, yes. Anf from the serious... Critics. And this is a real departure for you... From anything that you ever... Yes, people can change. Of course you can't expect miracles! - Thank you, Miss. Fisher. - A pleasure. Could you make it out to Douglas? To Douglas... With thanks... Mary Fisher. How shall I inscribe it? Would you sign it... To Ruth? To Ruth... With thanks... Mary... Fisher. Thank you! Could you inscribe it to Alain, please? Bien sur! Your grasp of the post-modern metaphors... Is wonderful, Mrs. Fisher... Oh, no, no, no... Miss. Fisher! Please... Call me... Mary.
