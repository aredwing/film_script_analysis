A bet against Do you go so far on principle, Vincent? Or it's natural? I understood you wanted to live this way when... you obeyed the Commandments to the letter. But now you don't want to do it... truly, Vincent, I can't understand it. Theo, if you do something, you must do it well? Do it well? What? I'm going to be a painter. What do you think of that? I don't like it. It's better than that trash you sell in Gulps. Not everything is trash. - It's trash, everything is trash! - We sell Millet, Corot. We sell many... of the artists that you'd admire, besides... - Oh, Millet! That's real art. Millet is art, Millet is authentic life. But here there's life too! And here is God! God is everywhere... but in the church and in our damned family. The money that dad has been sending you... wasn't his, Vincent. It was mine. Last time, Sold. Yes, I think it'll be sold. - Yes, I think so. Especially with that frame. Sir, they want to see Mr. Theo Van Gogh. He's over there. - I'll take care of that. Hello, I'm Ren Valadon. - Andries Bonger. It's bellow the Gerard. In the top right-hand corner... go up, and have a look. Theo where are you? - Uncle Cent, I'm here. Be careful. Well, Boussod y Valadon know what they are doing. They have no idea. - Things are changing... and they have no idea about what's happening here. If you was here, we could... - No, no... it's very kind of you to say that but. It's not possible. Cornelia wouldn't allow it... and the doctors... - Well, they are so... ...commercial. - Of course, art is a business... Good afternoon. I expect not to interrupt. No, Andries. Andries Bonger, Jan Bonger's... ...nephew, my uncle Cent. Bonger, I used to make my insurance with him. Now you can made it with me, I'm in the firm. And what brings you to Paris? - I'm learning the... trade in the office in Paris. And you are a friend of Theo, where are you staying? He's in my apartment. Ah! Two Dutch young men lost in Paris. It's nothing like that, sir. We are very serious young men. He studies the art of business and me... the business of art. I've heard that Vincent used to work here. Work? He used to walk around here... laughing at the paintings and offending the clients. What he didn't understand is that it doesn't matter if the art... is good as long as it sells. - You're right, sir. And I'm not sure either that Theo understand it. What? - Well... How is Vincent's art? He's working really hard. He paints the peasants. He dresses, pay and paint them. Hi, Vincent, how are you? Do you know, Vincent? The problem of being an artist... is that it takes a lot of time learning the technique. And when you've learnt it... probably you've forgotten what you want it for. I won't forget it. Don't turn the art in your religion. Why not? It's better than Christianity. Why don't you go to a real art school? I'm not interested, Mauve. I prefer to learn with you. - Like in old days. When all artists had apprentices, sorry. But now you live in the country and Mauve, here... I'm going to move here. I can't live with my family anymore. I despise them. - I can't believe it. It's true. And my father... I don't get on well with him. It's a hypocrisy that I go to the church. I wonder... Well, Vincent, I think you should marry... a rich woman. It's the only hope for an artist. I can't understand... how he has abandoned you being pregnant. None of my children had a father. I thought you just had Maria. It was one before Maria and other after her. They died. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter. It's the best thing that could happen to them. What could I offer to them? I should go to Leyden. What is there in Leyden? The maternity hospital. The doctor told me, when I had the last one: If you get pregnant again... come back immediately. I've got something inside that isn't okay. I could take you to Leyden if you want. Why would you do it? Because I want to. Al right - Fine. Can drink something? - Yes. Have a rest. Are you painting me? Yes. You can't do that. Why? Paint me when I'm posing not when I'm myself. I'm sorry, I'll stop. I have to go. It's raining. Why don't you stay? Why don't you stay... and live here? There's always room for one more at the table. And I could paint you. You must pay me for posing. I'm a prostitute. I know... ...and I'll pay you. I've a terrible temper. - Me too. And I want to bring Maria. I don't want to leave her. You can bring Maria. I'll paint her too. Okay, I'm going to stay. Are you going to stay? - Yes. I'm glad. Are you painting me yet? No, I'm painting this pipe, the eggs... the bottle, the candle, the bowl, the cheese. And not very well. Theo! - Hello Andries. Who is he? - Nobody, just a friend. Is he German too? - He's a Dutchman. I'm a Dutchman, not a German. It doesn't matter. - He used to live with me and... Who do you live now with? - With nobody. I live on my own. I know somebody that would like to live with you. What are you laughing at? I'm not laughing. Well, I'm laughing. Tell me. I was thinking of something. - Of what? In a painting. - A picture? Yes, a picture. What's the matter with it? When I saw him, years ago, it stuck in my mind. I was 17. It was a picture of a beautiful woman... in a room, in a boudoir. Sitting in a couch, stroking her hair. And I thought: If I could come into the picture and close it... I'll stay there forever. It's so real. Really incredible. The ships looks like real ones. Someday you could paint a ship like that. I don't know, I hope that. I'm sure. He's a man like you... and he has painted all this. - I don't know. He made it with his... wife and his friends. A woman painting? - Yes. But, why? You just have to go outside... and here is the real thing. That's what he made. He went outside and saw this. This is his perception of... ...reality. And he paint this and leave it here. It'll be here while this... place lasts. She has thought it was the beach. Well that's art. I'll take you to Paris. If you want to piss... on the paintings, I'll take you to Paris... where my brother works. There there are some paintings... you can piss on. In my opinion it's a specially good example... of his work. You can appreciate the... Turkish and Egyptian stiles influence. Here is a Gerome. That you could like more. Don't look at that! My colleague Andre will tell you about this painting. Well, gentlemen, this is an interesting and important painting: The fighting cocks Are you going? - For lunch, it's something wrong? We'd like to talk to you. - It doesn't matter, Theo, I'll wait. Sit down. We've been considering the future of this company. We know that you don't like to be here. It's not I don't like it, it's just I feel that... - We don't care what you feel. You're trying to fire me. Why don't you get to the point? Every day more galleries are open in Montmartre. It's a different market but... - We think that any branch should... ...focus only in painting And taking into account your... special interest in that area... It'd be an experiment. Are you saying that I could run my own gallery? Would you be interested? I think I should think of it. I'll think of it. Good afternoon. Hello Mauve! How are you? I've been painting. I want you to see my work. You're never at home when I go. I won't be again for you. While you are with that women I'm not interested in your paintings. Let's go, Maria. How is your wife? Does she know this? I see you have brought your bitch. Are you crazy? Do you have any idea about the... - Yes, she is a prostitute. I knew her pregnant and I love her. I thought they didn't understand you because you wanted to be an artist. Shouldn't we care about other? You're vicious, venomous and you look like a worker. I'm a worker. - Yes, I see. A painter. What do you know about painting? You have no idea. This is revolting. - Stop, Vincent, you're crazy. I thought you're the servant. Stay here. The baby is going to be born. - Can you walk? Their hair is darker than the Dutchwomen's. Their eyes more brown and they smile much more. Listen carefully, I'll explain it again. The reason why we Dutchmen like... French girls is... Don't be impatient. Theo. - What? Are you coming tonight? - I'm not going out. You're very boring. I don't want to go out. And you? Why does he paint this? It's revolting. It's what he sees. Anyway... he'll paint in oils soon. Leave him and peel potatoes. The baby is crying. He doesn't need much. Look what I have. My brother... uncle Theo... has sent me some paints. Where have you got the money? I've earned it. How? - What do you want me to do? Cleaning the house? Peeling potatoes? That's very funny. While you play with your paints. Hurry up, before start raining. It didn't work. You're decent and I'm not. Many times I don't know what are you talking about. Did you see the doctor? What did he said? The same as always. Did he say it is me? He told me that I should sleep alone for some months. Who am I going to sleep with? The door is closed! When de door is closed, don't come in. Poussin, come here. Where are you going? - To Saint Germain... to see the new blacks. Everybody talks about them... Are you coming or not? - I'm not interested. I'm going - Then hurry up. Are you going? - I can't sleep with you, so... I can't stay here. Don't ask questions. You wanted to change my life. Mind your own business. My life is fine like that. God! I hate this place! You know it's more complicated than that. The world of art, what we sell in galleries... is something very difficult. I should stop painting. I can't do it if you don't believe in me. I believe in you. But I can't force people to buy... what they don't want. I always forget you are a business man I'm not the owner of the gallery. I don't even run it, I work there. They'd fire me if... I tried to exhibit your pictures in their premises. You're generosity is killing me. I'm going to Paris. - What? I don't think you're ready. - When do you think I'll be ready? Probably never! Not yet. I want to make a deal. Every month, when you send me the pension, I'll send you the pictures I have painted. This way, when they ask me if I paint for money... I could answer, yes. For God's sake! And what about me, Vincent? Come in, Andries. This is my sister Jo, Theo Van Gogh. Hello. It's a pleasure. - Pleased to meet you. May I have your coat? I'm sorry about that mess. I didn't wait you so soon. Don't worry. It's new, isn't it? I think it's Montmartre. It's a Sisley. It's not Sisley, it's Montmartre - The painter is Sisley. The place is Montmartre. Sit down, please. Do you want something to drink? - Yes, please. We're in Paris, it should be champagne. But I only have wine. To Paris. So Andries... - Yes, I used to live here... I've spent many nights here. Beautiful pictures. All them are for sale. I'm just a dealer, everything is for sale. Theo' uncles are art dealers... According to them, you can earn a lot of money. Yes, but I don't earn too much. Almost nothing. You sell but don't paint. - That's it. My brother is painter. This one is his. It's ver Dutch. - You've noticed it. We Dutchmen recognise each other immediately. I'm going to see my old bedroom Excuse me. Go on, please. - No, thank you. Do you like pictures? - Yes, a lot. Do you sell many pictures? - Yes, quite a lot. No, not really. Well, yes and no. I mean that... I sell many that I don't like and I don't sell pictures that I like very much. Do you mind repeating it? I don't think I could. Is this the first time you are in Paris? Yes, it's the first time. Do you mind if I smoke? - No, I don't mind. They're Turkish. What are you doing here? Nobody returns after lunch. Emile Bernard. What's your name? - Vincent. Vincent what? That's a Mauve. - I knew his wife. He's my cousin. - She's very rich. This one is a Mauve too. It's not very interesting. Be careful. The one in the middle must be... It's a Czanne. This Czanne has to be on the top. Be careful, Andries. It' has been him. - Be more careful. This one has to be on the top. Here. Thank you. What do you think? - I understand this one. Are you going to ask her? - Who am I going to ask? Bonger. Joanna Bonger. What am I going to ask Joanna? To marry you. I'm not going to ask her. I'd like but I can't. You can't because you have syphilis. And you are the poorest man I've ever known. And why? Why I have no money? Because I take all you earn. Has dad told you how much did uncle Cent... get for Goupils? Has he ever told you? He's the owner of half France. Yes, I should talk to him. I have all planned. It's very sensible. Anyone would recover his investment in two years. More than that. There would be benefits. In three years there would be a lot of benefits. You should go and see him. I'll talk to him. When will you come back to Paris? - I don't have any reason to go. To visit your brother. - My brother? Have you come to Amsterdam to visit your uncle? Yes. And also expected to meet you. And you've made it. And here we are. Yes, here we are. It's so frustrating to work for people... that are only interested in the money. I have my tastes and I must be my owner. For many reasons. Am I one of them? I'm 30 years old. My health is a problem - Don't you have a good doctor? I have syphilis - I know. My brother told me. Those are the laws. There they are, like Newton. The theory of colours. And the chromaticism. Anytime I come to Paris there is another 'ism'. Impressionism Neo impressionism... What's the name of that one? Pointillism. You must know that painter, he's fabulous. He uses the colour with a scientific criterion. The art is emotional. - I know. I don't agree with you. Emotion is not enough. It's been probed that colours are intensified... with its complementary. - I've read it. We thought that we could change the world... in two years just because we wanted to do it. You were very young. Now I know we failed. And we failed for not being... scientific enough. I'm not sure about that. - I have no doubt. You get too excited. What has happened while I was out? What's the best thing of Paris? Talking to people, meeting people, speaking with other artist. - You should go to bed. Don't tell me there's no market for my work. Your job is finding it. If you can sell Corot... you can sell me. What are you doing? What do you do to... sell my pictures? I don't need you to tell me what is my job. I do what I can to sell you pictures. And I only ask you to find a home when I come back home. And how is the Dutch dolly? Has the servant come? I fired her. - What? She's not coming! I needed the money to buy paint. And I needed money to buy this. You had to buy that. We have more than a hundred Japanese printings. You should have left me more money. I've been out only ten days. What did she tell you? Did you ask her? You didn't do it. - No! Why not? How could I do it? We will be still alone. I've got one Dutch. The same we made ten years ago. He has understood impressionism. It's beautiful, isn't it? - Yes, it is. I'd like you to meet a friend. Paul Gauguin, this is Van Gogh. Pleased to meet you. I like your pictures. Do you know Emile Bernard? He showed me some and... - Yes, there were other. You haven't seen what made in Martinique. Look at this one. It's not bad. But Pisarro did it before. I love Pisarro. - My brother has 2... - 3 pictures - 3 Pictures in his gallery. Theo Van Gogh. Vincent's brother. He deals whit art. I lake these. Women are so tender... and wild. I'm wild too. I hate this puritan and missionary north. The nude, the flesh, the sunlight. I was born for that. When I was a child in Peru. - In Peru? I grew up in Lima. - You haven't told that to me. My ancestors were viceroys. Borgias of Aragn. The sun, the sun. Half of the people is always naked. That's the reason why the colour is so plain, dense and without transparency. The forms are absorbed by the light. How are you? Do you feel better? He says I'll be better... in a year but... it's a year. I've sold the Pisarro. Fine. Could you sell a Gauguin? I'm trying. He's ruined. Do you know what he told me? He told me that last winter... he had to work cleaning toilets... in that geriatric hospital that is in the Gare du Nord. I can imagine him. Don't believe in all Gauguin says. - Really? I think I'll go south. - Where? To Provence. Alone? Maybe Paul comes whit me. - Gauguin? Would you send me the pension, like before? Of course. Do you think you could give something to Gauguin? No, Vincent. I can hardly afford me to pay one. Are you saving for the wedding? Is everything alright? - Yes. Is your husband at home? - He isn't. You look very tired. I've tried to paint. - Tomorrow is going to rain. I'll have to paint inside. Would you want to pose for me? Who is going to want a portrait mine? Can I sit down? I'm Vincent. Before I was a Dutch painter, now I'm a French painter. Move - Who is winning? Christ the Sower. Christ the Sun. He sees Christ in everything. We're a very religious family. They're wonderful. For me He's the justification of everything He says it's him in the South. A modest Japanese monk adoring the eternal Buddha. Of course he looks like a Japanese. He says he's a monk. Well, the kind of monk... that goes to the brothel twice a week. You could go. - I don't have money to go to Arles. It's a pity, because I know that he'd like you to be there. He admires your work. You're the only person he has dedicated a picture to. Our uncle died some weeks ago. He left some money, not too much. You could take it... and pay your ticket. Your room is upstairs. Upstairs? There are two floors. - Two floors! What's this? - To practising fencing... and keep fit while I'm here. Is this. This is for me. Where is your studio? It's very... very beautiful. Where do the rats live? What kind of paint can you buy here? The truth is that it's very bad. Theo sends me from Paris. You're lucky of having a brother like Theo. This is very bourgeois. We'll use the cheaper. The yellow is a little bourgeois. What does that lady represent? What is she doing? She's shouting for being rescued by art critics. I'm not sure about that. This is not art. They look like posters. Look what colours. I've been in Buenos Aires. In South America is happening something incredible. The pictures. They paint in black and blue velvet. I found it fantastic. - Wonderful. It looks like a new movement, it'll be the future. Cockatoos, parrots, tigers... painted in velvet. Wonderful! - It's the new movement. Mr de Plantier! Seeing the depth of your feelings about... that new South American painting in velvet... I think you'd like to go to the Bureau Maritime and to buy four return tickets to Buenos Aires. Or better, five tickets. And have a good day. Please, What a manners! Good night. He was the mayor. How are you? Pleased to meet you. - Pleased to meet you. - He's a painter. Oh, fine! Which is the younger. - Cathy, she's there. The one with the pink ribbon. Hello. Cathy? I'm going to read a letter to her. Thank you, Vivianne. - Hello, Cessna. He was very rich. He was a stockbroker and sold everything. He had pictures. He sold everything because... he thinks that to paint you need to be poor. I don't know why we... bother to do this. I must be totally... impotent. - Me too. Do you want to marry me? No! - It was just an idea. What are you doing? Cooking. Nobody can cook in such a mess. How can you find anything? You have to do the right thing in the right order. I'll show you. You take a tomato... peel it... cut it... take the seeds out... cut it in slices. And now some fresh basil. Not too much. Give it to me. Thank you. Very good. And now you add some cheese. Do you see? The colours are complementary. Now some yellow. Your yellow. Olive oil... some salt... and that's it. The food is ready when you think it is. You don't need recipes. You have to use your imagination. Cooking is like painting. You don't like the way I paint. - I don't like the way you cook. I can't think of nothing. Then practise. I'm not crazy. You drive me crazy. All artists are crazy. I'm painting an self-portrait... with moustache of Mona Lisa. Don't you like it? - Take him out of here... or I'll call the police. Is that clear? Out! Sr. Holy Spirit, let's go praying outside. Haven't you head me? Out! - Leave him alone. If you do it again, I'll kill you. - You'll have to kill me. Out of here, come on! - Out of here you two! Are you alright? What has happened? You get drunk. You wanted to kill me. I forgive you. I'm coming back to Paris. You can't. Take this knife out of your mouth. Go out of here. Let me sleep. Slob. I'm going to take you this off. Do you love me? - Yes. One moment! Who is it? - Andries. Hello, Andries. - Hello, are you alone? - Yes. Well, no. Joanna! Joanna is here! - Your brother has come. I went out again with Celeste, she was in a very bad temper... I couldn't stand her. - Sit down. Champagne! - Do you want a drink? It looks like tonight you had better luck than I did. Yes, I'd love a drink. Help yourself. - Thank you. Jo, what are you doing? - She must be washing her hands. Seat down. - Good night. Cover yourself, it's cold. - Really, Andries... We have something to tell you. We're going to get married. Very soon. - After New Year. - That's wonderful. It's about time. Don't you think? We should make a toast for that. For a long and happy life. Vincent, it's you? Hey, bull! That's what I always say. Good morning. Good morning. See you tomorrow. Good morning! Mr. Theo Van Gogh, a telegram for you. I'm going to vomit. Thank you. I AM THE HOLY SPIRIT. I AM WHOLE IN SPIRIT. The police wanted to arrest me for murder. I'd like to know what has been happening here. He's completely crazy. Cutting his ear! He didn't cut his ear, just the lobe. Give me money to come back to Paris. You can't. You must stay here. You must see him. He's completely crazy. This is incredible. The whole family wants to destroy me. Your brother. Doctor, please. The food is delicious. Is it a good hospital? Yes, I think so. It's a very nice doctor. What has he said? He says he doesn't know. It could happen again. He isn't crazy, is he? - No. He is not crazy. It's jut an illness. I understand. The doctor says there is a place where... he can be looked after. It's in St. Remy. It's said to be very good. My God! I'm sorry. It's an asylum. Vincent is in an asylum. Have you got hallucinations again? They were nightmares. - What kind of nightmares? Sexual, religious. - Do you have them more or... less frequently? Less frequently. You know you're here as a voluntary patient. I'm alone, do you understand? I drink too much. And I feel lonely. I'm a nuisance. They put up with me. Don't worry. For the moment it doesn't matter. How many fits have you had? Four in four months, yes. From now on you'll have to be in a doctor's care. You understand that, don't you? We'll go on like until now. There's no treatment for... your case, except resting. And maybe the baths help you. I've given you permission to paint. - I can't. Everybody looks at me. We'll see how you progress. In a week or two we'll examine the situation. Trabuc, as long as he is with you there's no problem. He can walk, paint... do what he wants. Is it a new one? Is it a new one or are you reading the old ones? It arrived yesterday. - The coffee. - Thank you. What does he say? Nothing, really. Where does he get the time? What for? - He writes a daily letter... sometimes, two. - And how many pictures a day? Two, three, four...? He works a lot. - Can I read it? The letters are private. He has written it for me. They must be read only by the person... they're addressed to. I wouldn't read yours. There's nothing in them that could interest you. And why do you keep them? There must be around one hundred. Because they're from my brother and he has written it for me. But if you want to read them, read them. I don't like your moustache. And Vincent won't like it either. Vincent? - The baby. It's bristly, do you know? So you're going to call that bastard Vincent. It's a foolishness. - What? I was talking to my brother. It's ridiculous. Me, a godfather, in these conditions. A foolishness. What? I haven't said anything. It's time to come back. How many months are you pregnant? - Six and a half. - You have two and a half left. He's delighted. Do you want something? - No thanks. - I'll have a glass of water. Come, I want to show you my pictures. Do you see that man who is with Emile Bernard? He's Doctor Paul Gachet. - Did you tell him about Vincent? Doctor! Ah Tanguy! How are you? - Fine. I'd like you to meet... Vincent's brother. Vincent? - Van Gogh, I told you about him. Dr. Paul Gachet, Vincent Van Gogh. Yes, the brother. The famous brother. Pisarro told that they're the bests pictures in the hall. They're very good. Tanguy told me he is... in a sanatorium in the South. In St. Remy, he went in voluntarily. It's depressing. - Don't you think is good for him? Excuse me. Marguerite, please. I don't want you to talk to artists. Then...? - They're no good for you, don't do it. Who do you want me to talk to. - This is my daughter Marguerite. You know Tanguy. - Pleased to meet you. This is my wife... Dr. Gachet... - Pleased to meet you. And his daughter Marguerite. - Talk to Mrs Van Gogh. About your brother and the South... - Please... - Thank you. That's his problem. The mistral drives men crazy. A man can commit a murder during the Mistral. That's a legal defence. This is my brother Andries. Excuse me a moment. I'll be right back. - Hello. Take him out of there. To the North. To Paris. He needs to paint where healthy people paint... - Would you like to see him? Do me that favour. - Send him to Auvers, where I live. I'll keep him some time under observation, we'll see. What are you doing? - Washing the floor, don't you see? Why? - Do you love me? - Of course I love you. I've written to Vincent. - What? And if...? You'd better call the doctor. I think I'm going to give birth. The exhibition has been wonderful. Everybody thinks that his... pictures are wonderful. And me too. Bernard was there too. And the critics. Who cares about the critics? Tanguy was delighted. He said nice things about you. I'd like you to meet Mr and Mrs Ravoux... they're adorable. It's very difficult to find... a room in Auvers. Too many artists. Doctor Gachet. - Mrs. Ravoux, Theo Van Gogh. I'm Vincent Van Gogh - Yes, of course. The artist. The only one we have is the attic room. - Artists love attics. I see you have a new cook. How can you know it? It must be very hard for your daughter taking care of everything. - I want you to meet my daughter. - Do you want to drink something? Not me. We'll drink something at home. Do you know that seven painters have made me a portrait? Maybe you want to do me one. Hello Hilda. Mr Vincent Van Gogh. Is my daughter at home? Of course she is. Come in. She'll love meeting you. My brother told me that you have many pictures. Oh, yes! Monet, Cessna... All them. Where are they? - The pictures? Not here. In the safe. Did you meet Cessna? - Yes, I remember him. - No, of course not. You were just a child. He's a good company. - Yes. He's a wonderful artist. And I could help him... before he becomes famous. Helping people. That's my job. I am... although it's bad that I say it... a philanthropist - Yes, that's it, Mr... Mr. Van... Mr... - Van Gogh Vincent. An identity problem. I have one too. I've never know who I am. Gachet is a horrible name. People can't pronounce it. Gachet, Guichet, Gaucher... cachet, clich. I like huts. - What? I like huts. Adam and Eve lived in one. They should have lived in a house. And maybe then they wouldn't have lost the Paradise. Maybe they shouldn't have lived in a house. Maybe they should have lived outside... sleeping out in the open, under the stars. Nonsense, Marguerite. People need a shelter. In the Paradise? - Of course. God made a lot of mistakes. I like the stars. The world is a bad picture. He should have destroyed it. The world is crazy. Everybody knows it. Although the nature is perfect. Why bother to paint it? I can live without God, but not without painting. It's no use telling it to her. She can't paint. No. She can't paint. Hello, Hilda. Hens. And some ducks. At last I could get him off to sleep. This food looks delicious. I'm starving. Can you pass me the lamb? - Ah, the lamb. Do you want some lamb? - No. This is different from St. Remy, isn't it, Vincent? How much time was he there? He was there a whole year. Twelve months. In a couple of weeks he's completely healed. Covered with paint... working anytime... What do you think? Is he an ill man? No, he isn't. It's a healthy painter. Do you think he can come to Paris? - Of course. He can survive everywhere. In El Cairo, Beirut, Macao... Can you put me some wine? This man is not sick. He's an artist. We are the sick ones. The ones who are not artists. Just people. Working people, boring people... Just people. Mr. Boussod... has it be June our best month? Because look at this. June has been a good month. Ah, yes. - How do you explain it? There was an exhibition. - Whose? - Grapelli's. You must be satisfied with the way I run the gallery. It looks it goes fine. In that case, I'm sure you won't mind... that I remind you that I'm a married man... and that I have a son. My expenses have increased a lot. My salary hasn't increased since I came here. You have your commission. - Yes, of course. We've always said that we couldn't afford... an extravagant salary. So they are 25. I don't think extravagant is the exact word. I just want a decent wage... for a 33 years old married man. Are you only 33? - Yes. How old are you, Ren? - I'll be 34. Here there is some mistake. - Oh, too much. You have painted me twice. Do you want to paint me naked? I can't do that anymore. You're too friendly. With who? - With Vincent. That man is crazy. He's incurable. A hopeless case. I don't want you to see him again. You say that about all the men I know. Daughter, please. Have you fed him? - Yes, of course, but he doesn't want. I can't live here anymore. I'm tired of going up and down... so many steps. The baby is heavier everyday. I'm not a beast of burden. I've asked 3 times for this apartment and... I've told you 3 times. It's too expensive. Somebody's calling. It must be Vincent. I can't open. I'm not dressed. I'll open. Vincent is here. Yes, come in. And be welcomed. I'll fed the baby. You fed your brother. Give me that. I'll see them later. - What's the matter? - Nothing. We're talking about... moving. She wants to move. The steps are too much. Can you help me? I'll be right back. How is the baby? Vincent is fine. I don't have any chance of living, have I? Can you fill my pipe? Vincent's friends: I want to say some goodbye words. I knew him for a little time. But I love him a lot. He was so... My daughter... He was a part of the family. He was an honest man and a good artist. He only have two aims in his life: Humanity and art. And his art will live forever. I can't urinate. It's a series of rooms... like a museum or a gallery. A series of very expensive rooms. It's just a place where people can come. Where people can come and see what he made. To look at his pictures. That's a gallery. It's very full, don't you think? It won't be any space in those walls. That's the way it should be. Dinner is at 7 o'clock. We should go now. This it the most important... This is the most important thing in my life. What are you doing here? This is Vincent's room. Vincent's and mine. Out! Take your baby and go to Holland. What are you looking at? - Nothing. Vincent. Where are you? Help me.
