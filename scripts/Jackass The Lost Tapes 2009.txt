Well, I'm Johnny Knoxville, United States of America, and I'll be doing a little article on self-defence equipment. I'm going to start off by spraying myself with red pepper spray. It's the highest concentration you can get, followed by a 120,000-volt stun gun, and then I'll be getting shot with a Taser gun, 50,000 volts, for roughly around 30 seconds. This right here is where the hooks come out, I guess. Hit me! (COUGHS) (GROANlNG) -Oh, my God. -Give me the fucking towel. Fucking hell. I feel like my eyes have gonorrhoea. (GRUNTlNG) I won't put anything in my eyes, man. MAN: I don't think we should let him put anything in his face. -JASON: Knox, do you want the water? -No. MAN: Some gasoline. JASON: Spray you down? JASON: Dive in the pool. (SPlTS) JASON: Would that stop an assailant? JOHNNY: That would stop a fucking freight train. (BUZZlNG) Charge! (BUZZlNG) (SCREAMS) Fuck! (SHUTTER CLlCKlNG) (MOANS) There's really no marks left. That's where you got me. JASON: Do you want to do that one again? JOHNNY: No. Weren't you on 90210 not too long ago? (SCREAMlNG) Fucking hell! No, quit. Fuck. No, Jas. Jason, put it down. I'm gonna kick your fucking ass. -JASON: Here, do it to yourself. -No... Fuck! -Put it on top of your heart. -That would hurt. That one's been... That was worse than the stun gun. MAN: lt'll get infected. JASON: Damn, I can't handle that. MAN: Yeah, that's pretty nasty. (JOHNNY GROANS) -JASON: So what was more effective? -The pepper spray is the worst by far. Like, the stun gun, you get up again -in a few seconds. -JASON: But it knocks you down. And the Taser gun, yeah, that sucked. MAN: You guys want to go watch it on the TV? Ryan Dunn is getting tar and feathered right now. -BAM: Hey, Ry. -Yeah? MAN: Dunn got feathered. WOMAN: He got tarred and feathered. (ALL LAUGHlNG) MAN: Ryan, look at me. Ryan. I got tarred and feathered. I thought this only went on in Bugs Bunny cartoons. (LAUGHlNG) MAN: Let's go, dude. STEVE-O: Okay, dude. I'm gonna grab me some food for the team. WOMAN: That's two medium Cokes, small fries and cheeseburger. MAN 1: Yes. MAN 2: Go, go, go. MAN 1: Is there ketchup in there? (WHlSTLE BLOWS) Hi, I'm Preston. This is the human raft. Could you guys roll me over? (CHEERlNG) (ALL LAUGHlNG) CAMERAMAN: Mount him. You got to get on yourself. MAN: (SlNGlNG) Row, row, row your raft Gently down the stream My man. (LAUGHlNG) Oh, Man. Come on. This is your mother advising you to get on him. -Yeah, Mom is... -My mom's telling me to get on a guy. Yeah. It's not too bad being a human raft, huh, there, buddy? There's always the fringe benefits. -lt has its moments. -Yeah. Hi, I'm Chef Dave, and I'm gonna make an omelette for you today. There'll be no need for any knives. I'm going to process all the food myself. The ingredients are very important. A variety of peppers. Mushrooms are always good for an omelette. I'm so hungry. You cannot forget the eggs when you're making an omelette. Today we're gonna make a three-egg omelette. Got a little bit of shell in there. Don't want that. That'll cut you right up. Always add a little bit of milk for fluffiness. And cheese. I'd suggest medium cheddar cheese. It's good. (BELCHES) (MAN LAUGHlNG) The final ingredient is the eggs. (SNlCKERlNG) (RETCHES) (VOMlTlNG) (COUGHS) In this case, I've only seemed to bring back up the eggs. Don't fret. All you do is just try again. (LAUGHlNG) MAN 1: No. STEVE-O: no, chuck the bottom up, dude. You gotta. Cooking is relaxing. STEVE-O: Any second now, I'm about to... MAN 1: Biatch. As you can see, the colours are really blending together nicely. (ALL LAUGHlNG) MAN 1: Just eat the shell, too, you probably should. -lt wasn't that bad at all. -MAN 1: He's got it. (MAN EXCLAlMS) I think we have enough for our omelette today. Next step is to add it to the skillet here. (MAN CACKLES) MAN 1: Can you get us a close-up? DAVE: Like I said, a medium heat is best. Can you smell that? It's getting there. It's getting there, that's for sure. And there's not enough to feed everybody, but I would like to call one volunteer out from the audience to try a little bit. -Would anybody... -STEVE-O: I'd say I'm a little bit hungry. DAVE: All right, come on up here, man. I think you're gonna really enjoy this. MAN 1: Yeah. It's hot. It's hot, watch out. You want to blow it off a little. I bet it's really no big deal. MAN 1: Eat it. Chew. Chew. MAN 2: Swallow that. MAN 1: Chew. MAN 2: You got to swallow it. Swallow it. -MAN 2:You're being a sissy. -Come on, I cooked that. -MAN 1: Come on, eat the whole thing. -MAN 2: No. -I cooked that for you. -MAN 2: That's rude if you puke it up. Don't... Do not. I puke it up 'cause I'm cooking. -MAN 2: Eat more, dude. -No, no. (LAUGHlNG) MAN 1: Hold on one second. Don't do anything. Yeah, do it. MAN 2: Don't let Jeff's presence deter you from puking. (MAN EXCLAlMlNG) I swear, dude, it's not your omelette, dude. It's just the idea of your omelette. MAN 2: Don't you puke on the chef. Don't you puke on either of the chefs. (ALL LAUGHlNG) I'm out of here, man. That's fucked. MAN 1: Oh, my God, dude. MAN 2: Hey, Dunn, what's up? WOMAN: Oh, my God! MAN 2: Oh, my God! Hey, my name's Chief Roberts, and the only thing I love more than messing around with horses is messing around with my cowboy friends. (WHOOPlNG) JOHNNY: This is the shockwave collar mike. It's a fenceless dog collar, and what happens is, you put this around your neck, and when you overstep the wire boundaries, it administers a shock. (SNlCKERlNG) (BUZZlNG) (EXCLAlMS lN PAlN) JEFF: Did it work? JOHNNY: Okay, come here. (BUZZlNG) (SCREAMlNG) -Get it off. Get it off. -JOHNNY: (LAUGHlNG) Come here. Now, Jeff and I and Pontius have tried it out, and we're going to convince Kosick that this is a piece of audio equipment. Unbeknownst to him, he's gonna be shocked, and probably pretty angry. MAN: Who should have the mike? Who's gonna wear the mike? I think Rick should wear it, because Rick's gonna be the closest to you. I think Rick's the... JOHNNY: I think you'll have better sound. JEFF: Put the headphones on. JOHNNY: Yeah, put the headphones on. -ls it really tight, though? -It's tight, but it'll work better. -Hold on. -I don't hear nothing. (BUZZlNG) Stop it, now. Stop it. Stop it. JEFF: I'm sorry. Don't do that. Don't do that. JOHNNY: Dude, that's an expensive... That's an expensive piece of equipment. -Stop. Stop. Stop. -JOHNNY: It's the PX-1. Who wants some? Knoxville? -JOHNNY: I had nothing to do with that. -Yeah, right. I really had nothing to do with that, Rick. -That's bull... -Nothing to do with that. JOHNNY: That was all Jeff's idea. Your neck goes like this... Like, just this crazy pain. I don't wish upon any animal to be wearing that stupid thing. That's just pure torture. Whoever invented it should just be burned in hell. -It's torture. -MAN: Are we out of here? -What the... -That one hurt. MAN: What's up, mister? What's your name? My name's Satan, and... I don't even know what I'm doing here. I should have stayed down in hell where I belonged. -Where are you now, Satan? -I'm in California, and there's a big problem with God here in California. He's everywhere. Keep God out of California. Fire doesn't burn if you're already dead. Keep God out of California. Don't listen to these people. They're liars. You might know of me from that book that you read, but those things that were written about me aren't true. For one thing, God didn't invent circumcisions. I did. Keep God out of California. I'm not a bad guy. All that stuff that they wrote about me was a lie. Jesus did not invent the circumcision. I did. The devil himself. Don't hate the player, hate the game. I'm actually a pretty nice guy if you get to know me. -God bless you. -God didn't bless me. He wrote a bunch of fibs about me. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) Hi, girls. -I'm the devil. -Are you being sarcastic? -What's that mean? -No. They threw me from heaven 'cause they were jealous that I invented the circumcision. God was spying on me while I was in the bathroom, and he took the idea from me. If you read it... You can read about it in Genesis 18, but it's a complete lie. So I'm just here to clear my name. I'm a nice man. -Fuck you, man. -I'm a nice man, sir. You want to fucking die right here, fucker? Get the fuck out of my fucking sight, dude. I came here... Get the fuck out of my fucking sight, you motherfucker. -That's not Christian. -I'll fucking murder your ass right here. WOMAN: Hey, stop! Hey, hey, hey, bitch. Get the fuck off him. Get the fuck off him. MAN: Get the fuck off him. You crazy motherfucker. CHRlS: That's not a Christian thing to do. Psycho. RYAN: Whoa. MAN: Home run. RYAN: Watch out. Watch out. MAN: Shit! BRlAN: It's a 12-inch diesel-powered chipper. It's a 200-horsepower unit. It feeds the material in the back of this unit and disperses it out the chute. I'm Ryan Dunn, and I'm about to have fun with the woodchipper. BAM: Hey, Ryan, doesn't that look familiar? I think he's trying to say I got a small wiener. Strawberry milk. Let's try something mellow first. (GRlNDlNG) What are these? Gross. He's gonna hate this. Dude, the squid hurt so much worse than anything else. RYAN: What was that? MAN: It was the frozen turkey. Oh, my God. Look at that. That just came out of my head. BAM: Dude, you smell like hot trash. (SNlCKERlNG) (LAUGHlNG) (GROANS) MAN: Dude, I'm sorry. -Hi, I'm Steve-O. -And I'm Ehren, and we're here downtown 'cause we're the best damn football players ever to hit the city. -Yeah, no more JV for us. -No way, baby. We're hitting the street, yeah! (STEPHANlE CHEERS) STEPHANlE: Touchdown. (STEPHANlE WHOOPS) WOMAN: Oh, my goodness. EHREN: Fumble! STEPHANlE: Touchdown. Go blue and red, yeah! (STEPHANlE WHOOPS) Hey, do you know where this place, like, the Pink Flamingo... (GROANS) EHREN: Is this where the valet parking's at? I just got done with a game. (LAUGHlNG) MAN 1: Move forward. MAN 2: Look at the steam. MAN 1: There's a foot of turd hanging out of your ass. That's disgusting. MAN 1: That's sickening. MAN 3: Shit, here comes the deuce. MAN 1: Wait, let me shoot pool. MAN 1: That's disgusting. Dude, wipe your ass. MAN 2: It's steaming. MAN 3: It was fucking steaming. Steamed dumplings. MAN 1: It's so cold out, I can almost crack this. MAN 2: That was disgusting. That was so sick. (SlNGlNG) Hi, Oompa Loompa. Thanks, buddy. -My name is Richard. -Richard? MAN 1: Put some shit on his nose. MAN 2: Fuck this... (LAUGHlNG) MAN 1: Dude, you... MAN 2: I was trying to get in on the party. So we're in Knoxville, Tennessee, outside of Eddie's Auto Parts. Now, the owner is a friend of my father's named Eddie Harvey. He's got a really short temper, and we're gonna send Dimitry in there with a Russian accent to see how long it takes him to get hot. DlMlTRY: Who is Eddie? I need help. -DlMlTRY: You Eddie? -You need a tape? DlMlTRY: No, I need help, we say. My car, she break, down street. You want the mechanic? DlMlTRY: No. Eddie. MAN: That's Eddie. DlMlTRY: Who's Eddie? You're Eddie? I need spark plug or something. -DlMlTRY: How much? -I ain't charging you nothing. I said I was gonna give it to you. DlMlTRY: I need more. What if break again? -One, one to a customer. -DlMlTRY: Come on, you give me free, but it's free headache. I got $1, but I need more than one. I give you $4 for two. You give me three more dollars or you're...out of luck. DlMlTRY: I have rubles. You take rubles? I bring you dollars. DlMlTRY: Dude, he didn't get mad at all. -Nothing happened. -What did he say? He was gonna let me walk out of there with four spark plugs for $1. Go back in and try to get him hotter. DlMlTRY: Okay, I find money. You give me spark plug. I need... You sell engine? Maybe new engine I need. Yeah, well, I don't know what you need. I can't understand. I'm not... Hell, I can't understand nothing but the damn English language. I don't know nothing about... (DlMlTRY SPEAKlNG RUSSlAN) It won't start, hell, put some gas in it. You're probably out of gas. -DlMlTRY: Okay, give me some gas. -What have you been used to, running a damn bicycle, riding a bicycle all the time? -DlMlTRY: No, it's car, four wheels. -Hell, when you get in a car, -you got to put gas in them. -DlMlTRY: Okay, give me gas... -Pound, one pound of gas. -Gas don't come by the...damn pound. It comes by the gallon. You want a gallon of gas... -What is it? You want a gallon of gas... -DlMlTRY: I need to go 50 kilometres. How much gas I need? (PHONE RlNGS) Pick up phone. I pick up. Hello, Eddie Auto. How I help you? I sue you. MAN: Well, get your ass out of here, then. A dead man can't sue nobody. DlMlTRY: What you talk, "A dead man"? Where you going? -A dead man can't sue you for nothing... -DlMlTRY: Come on, help me. What, you gonna hit me? You can't hit me. I'm gonna hit you, by God, if you stand right there where I can reach you. DlMlTRY: Here, reach me. You can't hit me. You can't hit me, come on. -You need to help me with car. -Put your damn hand out there. -DlMlTRY: You're too slow. -Put it out there. DlMlTRY: Hello, Eddie, Eddie. Help me, Eddie. I sit on chair till you come start car. -No, a chair, I need chair. -Get your ass out of here. DlMlTRY: No, I need... I take this chair. -...damn it. -I need chair. -Get the...out of here. -I need chair. -I'm not... -I need chair. -You little... -Start car. I take bat. -Now, get out the damn door. -I need start car. -Get out the door! -Who are you? You're not Eddie. I call police on you, Eddie and no-name friend. -Get the hell out of here. -DlMlTRY: I need you start my car. You start my car. Come on. You start car. Come on, what, you gonna get me? You stupid son of a bitch. You want me to come down there? Hi, I'm Steve-O. I'm somewhere in Louisiana. Right now, I'm about to get my ass kicked by crawfish. MAN 1: How bad do these hurt when they get a good pinch on you? MAN 2: Well, depends on if you get one like that one. MAN 2: See how its claw's like that? STEVE-O: Whoa, dude, yeah. We didn't feed them for three days, so they'd be hungry. MAN 1: That's gonna feel kind of funny going down your pants. It's not gonna get worse, dude. This is probably gonna be the equivalent of doing a Pete Rose slide through fricking thorn bushes. MAN 3: See, that's about what they do. They really don't let go. MAN 1: That thing's gonna kill you. And this is the crawfish diaper. MAN 1: And some in the front. Are they biting? (SCREAMS) Where? Where's he biting? He's clamped on to my butt cheek, dude. (SCREAMlNG CONTlNUES) Okay, I think I'm done, man. MAN 1: They almost bit you on Your Name, dude. What do you think? I think that sucked. As soon as Kosick comes out of the pharmacy, he's gonna get antiqued by Ehren. Bastard's on crutches, too. RlCK: Fuck. MAN: He's so pissed. -He's just so angry. -Can't turn your fucking face for one second. MAN: Oh, my God. EHREN: I just got to do... I just got to do... I... Going to play a little golf today. MAN: Hey, bub. Hey, no, no, no, no. JOHNNY: One second, one second. I'm swinging. MAN 1: Hey, bub. Hey, bub, you've gotta take them golf clubs and them balls -and go somewhere else. -Well, I got to practise my shots. Then you're gonna have to go somewhere else to do it. -The driving range isn't open today. -Well, this is not a driving range, bub. This is a miniature golf course. Well, I know, but I got to practise my swings. -Hey, bub, hey. -Watch out, watch out, watch out! -Here, you need to... -No, no, no, those are expensive clubs. -You need to take these clubs... -Just let me finish my game. -No, bub. -I got three holes left. -No, bub. -I got three holes left. I don't care if you got 33 left, okay? You need to take your clubs and go. -Just a couple more shots. -Hey, bub. Just a couple more shots. If I have to, I'm gonna call the law on you, bub. I haven't done anything. Hooked it. You made me hook it. Watch out. I don't want to swing with you here. I don't want you to get hit. Here, wait. Wait. I don't want you to get hit. -Hey. -Wait. Wait. Wait. Watch out. Fore! MAN 2: Hey, watch it! -Bub, I got the clubs. -Here, let me have my clubs. -Let's go. -Come on. -Let's go. -Oh, here, good. -Hey. -Wait. Wait. Wait. -Stand back. Stand back. -Hey, bub, hey! -Stand back! Fore! -Hey! -Come on, let me have my clubs. -Can't do that here, bub. Come on, those are my expensive clubs. -Well, come on... -My mom gave me those clubs. Hey, you need to take these and go. -Come on, let's go. -Come on, just let me finish my round. I got eight balls left. -Buddy, you cannot do that here. -Come on, I got eight balls left. Just one more time. Bub, you can't hit the golf clubs over there. It's a golf course. It says a golf course. It's for this little miniature golf course, bub. -It's not to hit way over yonder, okay? -God. -Come on. -Are you gonna charge me a caddy fee? -MAN: Hurt? -What? -Yes. -MAN: It's funny. God, no! MAN 1: Too hard? God, these emus are going around. They're breeding like rabbits and they're killing people. A lot of nature hosts try to have more of a Zen thing with the animals. Not me. I want to prove to these guys that I am stronger than them. I'm faster. I've got greater animal instincts. And I myself am an animal. -He's looking at me. -MAN: He likes you, boy. CHRlS: The tips of their claws contain a poison most scientists compare to the sting of 1, 000 black widows, and you're looking at an animal with two or three toes. I don't know. I mean, that's a lot of black widows. You do the math. The best time to catch an emu is when he's freaked out. -That's when he'll put up a decent fight. -MAN 2: Well, then, don't run after him. There it is. There it is! You got him. You got him. You got him. Open the gate. CHRlS: You got to show these animals... MAN 2: Lock him in! You're the boss! CHRlS:...that you are the boss, and, you know, maybe if you feel attracted to them, you could get a little pleasure from them. I'm not gonna do that right now, all right. MAN 1: Yeah, emu hunter. MAN 2: The emu hunter. Nice job, dude. That's good. -Have you done that before? -Yeah, they're pretty mellow. -They're not too bad, dude. -That wasn't bad at all. Well, that was the most intense thing I've done in years. Hey, we're gonna do the milk challenge, and we're gonna try to drink a gallon of milk in one hour or, actually, as fast as we can. Kristin is on white milk, I'm on brown milk, and Ehren is on pink milk. Cheers. Yummy. -How does it taste? -My stomach's starting to reject it. Oh, God. Sorry. (GROANS) Damn it. How did you drink that much milk and you're not puking? -She's gonna do it. -EHREN: It's impossible. MAN: I don't think so. Isn't it cold? Is yours cold when it comes up? Mine was, like, ice cold when it... It's the weirdest feeling, puking cold puke. -I gotta take a shit pretty bad. -So do l. I'm gonna poop. Oh, my God. MAN: Show me the empty container. Yeah. MAN: Gross. (ALL LAUGHlNG) DAVE: Dude, you missed the bucket. (ALL LAUGHlNG) STEVE-O: Yeah, dude. -MAN: Johnny, what happened? -I twisted my ankle a little bit yesterday. Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville and I'm going to get an x-ray. I'm Mary Lynn, the volunteer. I was trying to jump a river on a pair of roller skates. -DOCTOR: Stay just like this. -So the show's going good so far. (CLANGlNG) MAN: What are you doing? DOCTOR: You've got quite a sprain there, and you've got a lot of healing to do. -Okay. -So we'll put you in an air splint here, see if you can tolerate that. We'll put you on crutches. I'll copy your x-rays for you, and I don't think you're doing stunts for several weeks. My name's Bunny, and I'm the lifeguard here at the river, and although Mr Knoxville is a professional skater, he's not a professional swimmer, and my job is to make sure that guy doesn't get himself killed. My name is Johnny Knoxville, and today I'm gonna jump the LA river on roller skates. JOHNNY: Help me! Help! CHRlS: Buddy, I got you. Okay, I'm gonna try and jump it again without the ramp. JOHNNY: Oh, man, I might have broke my ankle. That guy right there is the best damn roller skater there ever was. Maybe in the whole town. I'm... I think my ankle's broke. If that jump costed him his career, I don't know who's gonna step forward to fill his skates. I'll tell you that much right now. -I almost made it. -You were close on that second one. You were about 5 feet short. You were about 5 feet short of a 10-feet jump. I'm with Raab Himself, and he's gonna be biking his naked ass down the middle of High Street. -Forward or back? -CAMERAMAN: Back. Okay. I like to call this one "Hand Off." Can you guys come here? I was just jacking up my car, and it fell on my hand. (SCREAMlNG) EHREN: It's not going anywhere. Hey, hold on. I got my keys. They're right... I think I locked them in the car right there. No, ma'am, it's okay. I think we're gonna get it here. I think we'll get it. No, it's just... It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. (EHREN SCREAMlNG) MAN 1: Pop the jack underneath. MAN 2: I don't know where the... MAN 1: Okay, we're gonna do a concentrated lift right now. EHREN: He's got the jack. He's got it. Can you rub my back a little? (EHREN SCREAMlNG) MAN 1: Call 911. EHREN: No, no, please, don't call 911. EHREN: I know... MAN 2: Breathe deep, buddy. MAN 2: Take it easy. Take it easy. MAN 1: I just made bubbles. I think we're all in agreement. For five minutes, anything goes. What happens underwater stays underwater. MAN 1: Gentlemen, start your engines. MAN 2: Gentlemen, start your engines. Don't get the raging hard-on in here. I'm Raab Himself, and this is skeet shooting. MAN: Pull. (PAlNTBALL GUNS FlRlNG) I got hit on my ankle. Did you see how fast I was running? I was like a cheetah. Someone got me in the head. WOMAN: Huge welts. RAAB:...damn, that hurt. RAAB: Nobody hit the bull's-eye. MAN 1: Get the rest of it. CAMERAMAN: Whose shirt is that? MAN 2: Pontius'. MAN 1: Get the rest of it. MAN 2: Yeah, make sure you get the rest of it. CAMERAMAN: Oh, shit. Four minutes left on tape, but oh, shit. MAN 1: You can't... (ALL LAUGHlNG) Oh, shit. X-Y. X-Y. -Hey, while we're being idiots... -CAMERAMAN: Come on, run up on it. MAN 1: Shit. Shit. -Oh, my... -Yeah! Hi, I'm Steve-O, and this is extreme unicycling. (SCREAMlNG) Let's do it. MAN: Dude. There he is! MAN: Whoa, my man is on. He's cool. I like him. I'll be watching Jackass. It hurt me. I knew I was completely finished when I did the cement slide. That's so special. Can I get the Lard Na vegetarian, please? Okay. Okay, great. No. -Excuse me, sir? -Yes? I ordered a vegetarian dish, and there's some kind of sausage in it. WAlTER: Really? Look at that. There's more there. Really? Let me see. -Smell that. It smells horrible. -Very hot. It... This was in my... It looks like poo. What, that one? -WAlTER: Yeah, bean... It's a bean. -WOMAN: Bean? -This is a bean? -WAlTER: Yeah. -Let me try, okay? I don't know... -What kind of bean is this? Is this, like, an Arkansas-type steamer bean or... WAlTER: Sometimes the... It's, like, one of these things? Yeah, and that... That... They put the whole thing. I don't know what he got. -That's a pretty big bean. -WAlTER: Yeah. -Sorry... Didn't see it before. -That's all right. That's okay. Did you figure out what was on that plate? I can't figure it out what is that, but we... JOHNNY: It was a bean curd... No, yeah, don't... Yeah. WOMAN: Somebody put it inside it. We never cook like that. Never ever happened like that before. Nothing fell out when you leaned over or anything? -Never. -Never. Never. JOHNNY: Okay, you guys have a good night. -WAlTRESS: Hello. -Hi, how are you? Do you have a vegetable noodle dish? WAlTRESS: You don't want meat, right? JOHNNY: Yes, no meat. This looks good. Thank you. WAlTRESS: We have Cantonese, too. -Excuse me, ma'am? -WAlTRESS: Yes? I ordered a vegetarian dish. Can you get the manager for me? This looks like it has sausage in it. -WAlTRESS: What is that? -I don't know, but it smells. WAlTRESS: I don't know where it come from. -What is that? -ls that bok choy? WAlTRESS: I don't know? What is that, like, a... MAN: No, no, no, no. WAlTRESS: Let me see. No, no, no. What? What? No, no, that's my newspaper. -WAlTRESS: Yeah, I know, let me see. -That's my private property. -WAlTRESS: Please let me see. -I'm feeling very cornered. I'm feeling very cornered. -WAlTRESS: No, if you let me see... -No, I'm feeling very cornered. No, there's your money. -There's your money. -WAlTRESS: I'm gonna call the police. Oh, my God. Come on now. Come on now. Let's go to the sporting goods store and play a little basketball. (EHREN BLOWS WHlSTLE) Game on. Jump ball. Ready? (BLOWlNG WHlSTLE) RlCK: Foul, foul. EHREN: That's a penalty. (BLOWS WHlSTLE) MAN: All right, that's enough. I don't want you in here. You either get out of here, or I'm gonna do something with that whistle you're not gonna appreciate, so please leave the store. -This is... -MAN: I want you out of the store. Now. Now.

She has her way. So this is... This is a baptism here? Well, with the serpent. -A baptism with a serpent. -Yeah. The only time I've ever heard of it is when people make dolls of other people so they can torture them. Being tortured was the first state of humanity. Bang-bang-bang myself, and, yeah, it brings about great reality. Oh, yeah, banging myself brings about a great reality. Is voodoo generally a violent industry?

Okay, today I'm gonna go try to pick out a mattress for myself, but it's kind of a bad time, because I have to urinate really bad. I like this mattress right here. Can I try it out? -Help yourself. You can lay on these. -Okay, let me... Everything has tags on them. It feels really good. It's really comfortable. Oh, boy. Oh, my... -Are you all right? -Oh, dude. -MAN: What are you doing? -Dude.

CAMERAMAN: Dude, the best part about it is that you squeezed it out, and then he shook your hand. CAMERAMAN: He's coming. He's coming, man. JOHNNY: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. CAMERAMAN: That was piss in your face, dude. Piss in your face. JOHNNY: (LAUGHlNG) That's got piss on it, too. Okay, we're even. -CAMERAMAN: That's terrible. -Oh, my God. I'm feeling haggard.

We want to show them that we're not gonna hurt them. They'll be our friends and let us give them a hug. I'll be honest with you. There is a certain amount of element of danger here. These are wild animals. They are sharks. They do bite, and they have bitten people before. The main thing you've got to watch out for is your hand movement. Don't pull on his tail or anything like that. So keep your hands pretty much in close or around. Keep it away from the mouth. -CAMERAMAN: Have you ever been bit? -Never by a shark. Steve-O, that's probably the most unattractive thing I've ever seen in my life. You look like you have Jimmy Durante's nose in your pants. Today we're going after the great white tiger shark. It's one of the most fiercest sharks in the ocean. MAN: Make a little chum soup here for them. Put a little... That's it. Let's start the appetizer. Open your eyes. (GARGLlNG) (ALL LAUGHlNG) BAM: We're gonna try to give them a hug and love pats and whatever we can. MAN: You look like a bi-curious superhero in that mask. CAMERAMAN: You got bit? Steve-O got bit. Imagine that. STEVE-O: I think we got some pretty sweet footage on that. JOHNNY: Is it just a little nudge, or are you gonna lose a finger? -Yeah, I don't think it's too bad. -MAN: Can you have a seat for me? STEVE-O: I hope I got footage of getting bit. I got all kinds of footage humping sharks. MAN: What led to the shark biting your finger? I don't know. MAN: Did it have anything to do with you humping the shark? STEVE-O: It could have. JOHNNY: Do you feel victorious or defeated, Steve-O? I mean, for not losing a finger, I'd say it's a major victory, you know? I don't know a lot of people who have been bitten by a shark. (ENGlNE STARTS) CAMERAMAN: Take that... Yo, Chris, take it off. (CAMERAMAN LAUGHlNG) Hey, hey, I'll take that. Hi, I'm Steve-O, and I'm the friendly neighbourhood urinal. MAN 1: Oh, there he is! MAN 2: Steve-O! Hey, anybody got to take a leak? -Line up in front of Steve-O. -Do it on Steve-O. -Thank you, man. Thank you, man. -Yeah, no problem. This is my old friend, Jason. (CROWD WHOOPlNG) Yeah, my man. Come on over here. STEVE-O: Hey, you got to go? MAN 3: You got to pee? STEVE-O: You got to pee? MAN 3: Come here and take a piss, man. Don't you feel the pressure in your bladder? Hey, Steve-O, juniper scent. Yeah! Yeah! -You got facilities for a number two? -MAN 3: You gotta go number two? I think we could probably work out a number two. MAN 3: Anybody got a number two in them? MAN 1: We need one for his head. MAN 2: Probably have to just tuck your head down. Here, put a pillow over on this side. Heads up. MAN 1: You ready? (GROANlNG) MAN 1: Get him back up. MAN 2: Wait, which is... Is this the top or the bottom? -Are you okay? -No, I'm not. That really hurt. I want to see the playback. MAN 1: At one point, it just took off. Like, you actually got airborne.
