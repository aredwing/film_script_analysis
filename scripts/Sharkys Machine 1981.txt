One time, when I was, uh, riding in a cruiser, before I got into Vice... Yeah? I got a call that there was a domestic squabble. And I was by myself in the cruiser that day. Had no partner. Hmm. So I went to this very, uh... depressed part of town. And I had to go around the back of this house and up these steps. I knocked on the door, and this lady opened the door... hysterical, crying, and was she bleeding. Well, I guess the guy had hit her or smacked her or something. And so I stepped inside, and then this guy just stepped out of... shit, the closet or someplace. I didn't see him. Hmm. And he had a.357 in his hand. He was ranting and raving, and I thought he was gonna kill me. I thought, God, I'm gonna buy it right here.  What'd you do? Well... I looked down the barrel of that gun, and I thought, Oh, shit.  So I just... I had to cease to exist. Do you know what I mean? I wasn't there. I pulled my antennae in, and I just, uh... minimized my force field. Mm-hmm. I disappeared. You disappeared? Yeah. I wasn't there. I... I gave him nothing. He felt nothing from me. No hostility, no animosity... 'Fraid that he could hear my heart beating, though... and walked into the other room. She was standing there, looking. I turned and walked towards the door, and she was still looking at the spot I was standing in. You were gone. Yeah, but, you see, I didn't exist then. Right. So I said, Ma'am, and she was startled. She looked and she said, Uh, yeah.  I said, He'll be all right. Go on. You know, tell him you love him or something.  Yeah? I'll never forget that. Me neither. What does Sharky think he's going to miss? I mean, it's all on tape, anyway. Well, he's enjoying it, maybe. You like looking at broads? He could take 10 minutes to take a shower. What's he gonna miss? I mean, she's just... You want some chicken? ...walking around. You know I don't like chicken, Papa. Jesus. Man, you don't like anything good. You don't like chicken. You don't like ribs. You don't like hamburgers. You eat that Jap shit. That raw shit. It's metaphysical. Metaphysical? Yeah. Raw fish is metaphysical? Sure. Fuckin' worms in it? Comes from the earth. - It's good for you. - Know what it does for you? Got iodine. All right. What'd it do for them Japs? You ever see a Jap who was more than 4 feet tall? Yeah, but they're very spiritual. You gonna tell me some more of that Zen shit? That's right. You notice how they can go out and live in a jungle off of just nothing? It's all in the philosophy. It's in their attitude about life. We eat too much in this country. No shit? That's right. Besides, ribs will kill you. How the hell did I ever wind up with you? Jesus Christ. Hey. I appreciate you guys letting me take a shower. Well, we appreciate you taking a shower. You can leave now. Smelled like the bottom of a lion cage. Go ahead. It's Don That's him, I think.

I mean, we can't go after Hotchkins. All you got is a tape. Would you look at that hole? Christ. The killer stood approximately... here, pressing the gun against the door... tall enough to get his body weight behind it. Probably a sawed-off shotgun... About 3 inches under legal, I should think. We've got the whole thing on tape. Shut up! This the same one who iced that Chink hooker? Asian, and I'm checking on it. And I'll talk on you. Asian? College. Twigs... call me later when you finish the autopsy. Mm-hmm. - Barrett, come on. - Hey, where are you going? I'm going to that building over there. Whoever iced that lady was watching her at the same time I was watching her. There's only one empty apartment over there. You were in it. There were 2 where people were out of town... I told you to shut the fuck up! He would've checked on it. We're dealing with a professional killer here I mean, this guy is cool He's what I call an ice man, and he's not stupid, either First door on the right. I suppose you're going to pop it. Why don't you just get the manager up here? He'll get the house key. He'll open it up. I was never good at this. Even when I was good at this, I wasn't good at it. How about you, Barrett? Were you ever good at this? Yeah. I always liked it. Ready? No, no, no. This scares the shit out of me! Well, we struck out again, right? Will you shut up? Not everybody's as neat as you are. You got to look. Barrett. Dominoe. Hey, Kitten. What do you say, my man? Can I talk to you alone for a minute? Get out, bitch. What's this? That's Valium... 5 milligram. That's funny.

You make it awful tough. I told you I didn't see him. I didn't get a name. - You know what I think? - No. What do you think? I think your fuckin' ass is in trouble! Oh, fuckin'- a, Arch! Come on! Goddamn it! - Hey, this is Kitten, man. - Can you fly? No, but I talk better on my goddamn feet! You better get some wings. You're my buddy. You're not gonna throw me. - Is that what it is? - Yeah!

Man, you're gonna hear from my lawyer, my attorney, every-goddamn - body, you got that? Oh, Arch, look, uh... Let's talk. Can we get over here? You're talkin', Kitten. Quit bullshittin'. I'm not, man. Just get over here. We're in the light. Come on, come on. What are you talking about? Look, look, tell me something. What? He's lookin' for us, Arch. Haah! That's not the look of a winner, Donald. I loved her. You loved her art. And she loved me. That was her art, creating that illusion. Yeah, well, you're wrong. You can be wrong, do you know that? Do you think you're God? Heaven forbid. I'm telling you that we loved each other. I'm sick of you twisting my life around. You went too far. There's no such place. I'm telling you, you went too... Shh. Tsk tsk tsk. You can't tell me, Donald. Now, shh! But perhaps you can learn from me. You draw a clear straight line to where you want. And you move. You do not stop. You do not go around anything or anyone. She would have stopped you, destroyed you. No. No. Stop the car. I'm on my way to what I want, Donald. I can take you with me all the way... or I can drop you here now. She wouldn't have hurt me, Victor. Open his door. I have a long way to go. Are you coming? Drive. Hey, boy. Hey! Good morning. Jesus Christ, what a great looking machine. OK, who's got what? Well, come on, put something on the table. Time's gettin' short. We got our nuts in a doorjamb, Papa. This is what the model looks like. Put that away. What's the matter with you? What the hell's the matter with you? Hard to come by. Somebody's tracking us, because they killed Kitten Holmes. - Kid who? - Kitten Holmes. He's an informant. He gives me information. They killed him. They didn't shoot him. They kind of just kicked his ass. I mean, they broke him like a stick. They kung fu - ed him. Anyway, I found out that our shooter has a bad habit. He's a junkie. Now, a buy went down last month. That puts him in town about the same time the other hooker got blown away. Can I say something? No, no. The blind woman and Roper were shot at close range with a silenced.22. Just one shot each. He's very sure of himself. I'd say the same man killed all 3. Nobody ever sees him come in or go out. May I speak now? Jesus Christ, speak. I told you he was dumb. Bureau made his print. No shit? Carlos Scarelli, alias Billy Score. He's 45 years old. I didn't see it. I don't care! Great reputation. Slave trade. Little girls. They... buy them, kidnap them, then they break them down... drugs, rape, whatever the hell it takes... then they sell them. They sell them? Who is they? They is him and his brother Albert Scarelli. Albert, he's been out of sight for about 15 years, but we got his ass, Sharky. You got the name. That's all you got. How about a face? Hey, a face. The guy on the left. Where? Let me see it. Will you... I didn't see it! I don't give a fuck! That's fantastic, fantastic. Look at this. Which one is it? Which guy? He's the guy on the left. This picture's about 20 years old. You make him, Sharky? I don't make him. OK, he's been in town about a month, right? He's probably still here. You guys got 40 more hours, then I turn it over to Homicide. I'll call you at home, Sharky. I'll be at her place. - Whose place? - Dominoe's. Oh, yeah? Is your figure Less than Greek? Is your mouth A little weak When you open it To speak? Are you smart? But Don't Change a hair for me Not If you care for me Stay Little valentine Stay What the hell are you doing here? Tiffany? Tiffany, where are you? I'm back Where is she? Tiff let you in, didn't she?

Sharky. Vice. A woman was killed here yesterday. We thought it was you. What? You said Tiffany. Was that the woman's name? Was that the woman's name that stayed here yesterday? Tiffany? Tiffany. You sure it was Tiffany? No, I'm not. But somebody was here. Couldn't you have taken it off the goddamn wall? He thinks you're dead. He thinks he killed you. Who? William Score. Scarelli. Did you ever hear of him? No. Get your stuff together. We're going to get out of here. Hello. Shark, the tapes are gone. What? Yeah. They're missing from the squad room.

Where have you been for the last 24 hours? I went to the mountains. I like being alone sometimes. None of your business anyway. I see. You told Tiffany you were going, though, right? Right.

They are my pictures, aren't they? Why do you have my pictures all over your wall? I don't know. Does Victor use the other women like he uses you? Does he pay you? Or does he own you? You're so goddamn smart, aren't you? He owns you, too. You're just too naive to know it. Nobody owns me. I don't want to talk anymore. I'm so tired. You got to give me a little time. We don't have any time. We're fresh out of time. Can I just take a shower? Over there. I forgot about the pictures What a putz. Hope you don't mind... I borrowed your robe. Sure.

I'll tell you the difference! I'll tell you the friggin' difference! He's gonna blow us away! Now, tell me his last name! Did you watch us? Did you watch all of it? Shit! How many other people did he set you up with besides Hotchkins? Did you enjoy watching us, Sharky? Get off of that! Why? Does it bother you? Does it make you feel like some pathetic peeping Tom, huh? You bitch. Don't make me call you what you really are. So he bought you, and then what? He didn't buy me! Well, what were you, a librarian?! A nun?! A schoolteacher?! I'm a dancer! Can't you see?!

Hitting and pushing and punching. Does it make you feel good or something? Sometimes, yeah. Aah! God damn it! God! Ow! I'm never gonna tell you! I'm never gonna tell you his last... Oh, God!

I come here every weekend, and those damn kids are out there playing. I can't work when they're there. I have to stop and watch it. I could watch kids playing all day long. You're a strange guy, Sharky. Yeah. That's what everybody says. Just find Sharky, huh? Tell him to come on in He's so far over his head I hear you're onto something big. Just read my report, OK, Friscoe? Read the papers tomorrow. Everybody down there is so goddamn cheap they won't buy a goddamn paper. Are you gonna talk to me? No! You just wait a minute. You know something, right? Sharky was right all the time One man on top of the whole town and one fink inside the Department Joe, I don't know where Sharky is You are an asshole. Get on a phone and find him. You want to help? Then tell him to come on in. Tell him it's a goddamn fix. Tell him there's no way that he can win. What'd you find out? Never mind what I found out. Joe, where are you going? I'm going to the D.A. Now! I'm gonna get Sharky that head he's been hunting for I've got the son of a bitch! Aah! Stop that son of a bitch! Get back! Get back! Get back! People, back! Oh, Christ, Joe! He's dead! What are you doing? Just working. A window seat. Yeah. Did you make it? Yeah. It's very good. Thank you. What are you doing there? Uh... just... doodling. Doodling what? Doodling. Just doodling? Mm-hmm. It's a rose. Were you embarrassed to tell me you were making a rose? No. Yeah, you were. Yeah. You're a strange guy, Sharky. I know. That's what everybody says. At the far table. Thank you. Oh. Sergeant Sharky. Please sit down. No, thanks. I just came to look. What do you see? Nothing much. Care to have some food? It's Chinese food without a trace of Western corruption. Pure. I've got you by the ass. Oh? All the way from selling little girls to murder. How does it feel? It feels great. It feels like you're a lump of shit lyin' in the bottom of a commode, and I got my hand on the chain just waiting to pull it. Look at you. Righteous anger. Defender of the people. Tell me something, Sharky. Why are the people on my side? Why do they line up with me instead of you? Huh? Ha ha ha. Confusing times. You have nothing. No tapes, no link with Hotchkins, except a dead woman. He's as good as governor. You're an outcast about to lose that badge of yours. You're about as bothersome to me as something stuck to the bottom of my shoe. As I see it, you have 2 choices. You can disappear... or maybe I can throw something your way. Perhaps even another Dominoe. Pick one. Go ahead. Ha ha. Of course, she won't be quite as good. Dominoe was the best. She was 12 when I found her. Can you imagine? I taught her, and I taught her, until she began to teach me. Yes, she was the best, because I created her. Anyway, that's all academic, because she is gone. She's alive. Have you talked to Tiffany lately? Somehow I get the feeling that your rear end is puckering up. I'm gonna pull the chain on you, pal, and you want to know why? 'Cause you're fuckin' up my city, 'cause you're walkin' all over people like you own them. And you want to know the worst part? You're from out of state. Nosh? Nosh? Kyah! Hiy! Hello, Sharky Hello, Smiley. You look awful. You met the Chins, huh? Yeah. They're delightful. Oh, by the way... your friend, uh, Jojo... he's gone to that big police station in the sky. Oh, and... and also... Nosh... has gone there, too. Aah! You know, when you went to see the man, you really pissed him off. You should have just brought the girl in. She'd be dead, but Nosh and Jojo and all your chums would be alive, and you, too. Yeah. Paco? What, is he auditioning for a job at Benihana's? Oh, you're funny, Sharky. OK. Now, let's make this nice and simple. I'm gonna ask you a question, and you're gonna answer me. Sure. And it'll all be over just like that. Otherwise, he's gonna take your fingers off, one joint at a time. And now, I figure you got about, uh... 10 answers, and then, if you don't bleed to death, you're gonna run out of joints. Now the question. Where's the girl? I don't know what you're talking about, Smiley. I don't know anything about any girl. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Where is Dominoe? Ok, Sharky, I think we've arrived at what the bullfighters call the moment of truth.  I'm gonna ask you for the last time. Where is she? I don't know. Come on, Sharky, yell. Come on. It's got to hurt. It's painful. Ha ha ha ha. I mean, it's not as though it's like you're gettin' a manicure. We're in the middle of a lake. Go ahead, yell. Want to try for 2? Now listen good. Where did you take her? I... I... I... I... I... I don't know. Aah! Now, look, this is embarrassing, it's pathetic, it's pitiful, watching a grown man cry. I don't want the boys to do that. Uh, guys, take a break. Get some air. You're a crybaby, Sharky. I always knew you were a crybaby. All that shit around the Department about Sharky the tough guy, the tough cop, the macho man... I knew you had no guts. Not only that, you got no fingers. Ok, Shark, let's cut the macho shit. Nobody's here. It's just you and me. It ain't there. I took your gun into protective custody. What do you think we are, dummies? We looked up your nose. We looked in your ears. Every orifice. Now... I'm gonna lean in, and you're gonna whisper in my ear where the girl is at. Then I'm gonna get the Chins in here, and it's gonna be over just like that. O-OK... OK, Smiley. Good boy, Shark. Shit! God damn it! Kyah! Aah! Ladies and gentlemen, the next governor of the great state of Georgia Donald Hotchkins! Thank you. Thank you. We want Don! Thank you. Thank you. Please. Thank you. We want Don! We want Don! We want Don! The governor has just conceded at 4 A.M., and I hated to keep him up so late, but I'm gonna... I'm gonna give him 4 long years to rest up.

I'll buy another one Here's 20,000 for you I'll contact you later, OK? No. Hey, Carlos, you misunderstand. You can't be seen with me. I can still make it if I move now, quickly, and alone. But I'll send for you soon as I get set up somewhere. - OK? - No! After all these years? You go to hell! Send for me? No! No! No! I go with you! Carlos, you'll do as I say. You'll do as I say, as always. Please, Victor, please! Look at you! You're not strong enough! You're a walking drugstore! A dope head! You should try! Look at you! Junkie! A used-up butcher. Control all gone. I don't need you anymore! Do for yourself now! Fend for yourself! Like my big brother? Yes! Act like you? Well, try! I will! I will try! All right. I love you! I love you, too. It's all right. Unh! 368, block off the underground parking area Cover all exits 402, 402, move into the lobby Secure all elevators and stairways Nobody comes in, nobody leaves. I say again, nobody comes in or leaves. We're gonna need a 1052 for a backup. Roger Your 1052 is on the way We're set, Shark. Let's hit it. How many men we got down there, Jimmy? There's a hundred of them at the bottom of the building. Son of a bitch! Shit! Aah! He's dead, Sharky. He's dead. For God's sakes, Sharky, he's dead. - Who killed him? - The brother. Aah! - What's your name? - Mongol. Come here, Mongol. I want to talk to you. Jimmy? Go down to the 40th floor. 2 men on a floor and work your way up. Yes, sir. Arch, this son of a bitch is going to walk out of this building, and some goddamn traffic cop is gonna take him off! Sharky! Not more than 5 minutes ago the son of a bitch is on the stairs. The fire exit! I'll check it. Shit! I don't like it. I don't either. Sharky! Coming your way! Sharky! Papa, where are you? By the friggin' door! Don't move! It's the only way out of here! Well, haul your ass. I ain't gonna save him for you! Unh! A fuckin' ghost. Sharky, the guy's a fuckin' ghost. I just said that. Yeah, you did. You go that way. Yeah. Sharky, that better be you. It's me. Jesus. Sharky! You told Papa there's one way out of here! You fucked up, you dumb shit! It's not your fault, Papa. He ain't real. Aah! Aah! Aah! Son of a bitch! Unh! Aaah! Aaah! Oh, shit. You all right, partner? Of course not, you asshole. I'm shot. Oh, shit. Where the fuck is he? He crawled off towards the stairway there. Sharky, I hit his ass. He's got 4 bullets in him, and the fucker won't go down. Maybe he knows more about Zen than you do. Yeah. I tried to disappear. I bet you did. But I couldn't. - Hang on. Hang on. - Shit. There'll be somebody here, OK? - All right. - OK. - Sharky? - Yeah? When you find him, you got to put him down. I'll put him down. Sharky? Yeah? Smack his ass in the ground. You hear me? Yeah. Sharky? Yeah? I'm talking about burying him and putting a stake through his fucking heart 'cause he's not real. I hear you, Arch. Sharky? Hey, Sharky? I think I ruined a perfectly good jacket. Ahh Hello... Sharky. Do you know... what I was thinking? No. Do you think... I'll live... or die? Oh, you'll die all right. No... No. No, I don't think... I don't think so. Not... not by you. Die! As I turn the pages of my life All the days go spinning by Too quick for me to read between the lines There's no future in the past I've saved the best for last To look at me now You would never believe Before you My life ran in circles to nowhere Before you The same day played over and over Before you I was a face at the rail Of a ship setting sail With no one waving good-bye Before you Before you Before you came into my life You're a woman who understands The meaning of a man You take me as I am But leave me free to be I see the reason for my life Shining in your eyes I look at you now, and it's hard to believe Before you My life ran in circles to nowhere Before you The same day played over and over Before you I was that face at the rail Of a ship setting sail With no one waving good-bye Before you Before you Before you came into my life Before you Before you Before you came In to My Life
