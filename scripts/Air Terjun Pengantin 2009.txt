Let me go! I don't wanna marry you! Let go! You evil witch! No! Let go! Let go! You evil witch! Help! Help! 'Good morning, listeners... ' You're fine, right? I'm still afraid of the dark. I'm scared. When can your phobia be recovered? You never take a rest yourself. How can you recover now? My body's already fine, you know. That's the problem. Now your body's fine. But if your mind is still messed up, that's just a lie. It's all in the mind, babe. / You're very typical. I say this, you say that. The answer is this... You know, don't you? You... Hey, don't do that before me. Get a room, please. Just let them be. Newlyweds. They want it. Oh my! You're just envious. How's it? Check, check... It's just on. OK. It's me Ical. That's my enemy. Here she is, the plump. Hi!/ You better pack up. When we're leaving, you're most hectic. Just go. Why aren't you very excited?/ Who cares? Dinar, hi! Hi! Is that already on?/ Yes, already. This is our driver, Bram. Bram!/ Don't shoot this. Just let him. You envy us, Cang? That's my girlfriend, Stacy. / Woa, always envious. OK. We're already tired of going to Puncak, right? And we went to Bali already last year. Now we'll go to the Bride Waterfall. It's said if we wish for something there, it'll surely happen. Hello. / Mandy. How's it? Wanna leave already? Yes. By the way, I want it to be a full vacation. No handphone, no laptop, no work. Got it?/ OK. Got it. Well, see you there, OK. Bye. Darling, come on. Come on. / Let's go with you. / OK, let's go. Hi, Mandy!/ Tiara! Finally... / Please, meet Amy, Icang, Dinar, Bram, and Stacy. Hi. / OK. So, anyone who is seasick? I don't think so. Maybe, just Icang, right? The ship is cool, right?/ Yes, cool, cool. Isn't it, dear? He's Milo, my boyfriend. Lo, when do you plan to marry Tiara? Anyway, as already planned, you all go by this ship. I, Mandy, and Milo will go by that ship. As it's very small, it can't take everyone, OK? OK./ Let's go. Be careful, Mi. / I'll spank you. / Hi. Tiara, you see this? Darling, remember, don't you? When we were in Samarinda, right? A very long time ago, right? Tiara, thanks. I need this kind of vacation badly. Hey, don't be sad all the time. / I missed Mom. I know. But you've already been sad for 2 years. Just been sorrowful. Your Mom wants you to have a holiday. She wants you to have fun. Give me a hug. You have to be strong. Enjoy and have fun, OK? OK./ Right?/ Yeah. Guys, let's go! The Bride Island. Kayla, that's the island, right?/ Yep. That's the Bride Island, one of the Sunda Kelapa islands. And the Bride Waterfall you're looking for is in this island. If I'm not mistaken, there's a Dutch cemetery inside. The island! The rope! Hello?/ Isn't that right? Icang brought his handphone. He didn't leave it. / Just turn it off. No signal! Yes. He's not cooperative. / Is the waterfall far from here? Not so far. By the side of that cliff. On the right. Pass the bridge and just go ahead? Headline news. Who brought us to this island? Tiara. Let's have the following interview. Thanks. Let's go, ladies. / The sea is incredibly cool. / Come on! This is Tiara who brought us here. Say hi. That's the island. Thanks, Tiara. Thank you. Hey, wait up! Darling, just now Icang asked if we were already engaged. Darling. Darling!/ What's with him? Huh? You really didn't listen, did you? You don't understand I'm very tired. Everytime there's a family gathering... I'm always asked when I'll get married. Then, how about our relationship? You wanna marry me or your family, huh? Why is it called the Bride Island. / This is the story. This island was empty back then. But long time ago... there was a shaman who forced to marry a village girl here. But he wasn't permitted. So, he kidnapped her. At last, the whole villagers chased him. An accident happened. He resented. Then, he killed them one by one. This island became empty. / Wow, it's very scary. It's just a myth. Beach! Yay! Yay! Let's change! Again! OK, guys. The Bride Waterfall already waits for us. Now, let's go there. OK? Who's that?/ What's it?/ Who? OK, come on. OK. I'll tie this as a sign. If anyone gets separated, just find it. I'll tie it every 15 meters. Easy to see. So, if someone gets lost, don't worry. Moreover, the way to our ships is just straight ahead. You'll hear the waterfall soon enough. I feel queasy. Hey, let me go back first. I wanna rest at the beach. Wanna go back now?/ You all go first. I'm very dizzy. I'll catch up later. / Bye. You heard that?/ Water? The waterfall!/ Yeah!/ Let's go! That old guy's correct. Like a bride. / Crazy. Amazing. Baby, what's the matter? Is there another guy? Ouch, it's not deep. Be careful, baby! If you wanna be able to disappear, cut her hair. If you wanna be invulnerable, cut her finger. And swallow the blood that comes out of it. No. No, no. Everyone OK? The waterfall is in front of us. So, if you wanna make a wish, just do it now. / Make a wish! What did you wish, darling?/ Don't just pretend not to know! The god and goddess of love, please help me open Amy's heart... to surrender herself to me tonight. Amen! So, you want me to surrender myself to you tonight? May I? You want to? Come on!/ Huh? Huh? You said you'd like to. Why look confused? You prayed for that just now. You want it, right?/ Yeah. Don't splash on her. My poor babe! Hey! Someone's there!/ Where's it? There was someone there wearing a mask. Someone was there wearing a mask. / Impossible. It was very hard for us to find this island. So, it's impossible for someone to be here. That's right. Someone was there just now. What's that? Seems to be an old house. Let's go there. Come on. Hurry up. Let's go. There used to be a canned fish factory. But it was closed as the workers didn't stand staying here. It was because this island was considered eerie. It seems to be a Dutch fortress. No, darling. Looks like a Dutch cemetery. Baby, what's that? It seems like a canned fish factory. Let's go there. Come on. / No, I'm tired. Come on. / Don't be too long, darling. I wanna go back. Let's go, baby. It smells fish. Is it locked? It isn't locked. Just get inside. Come on. Nobody here. Oh, baby. The waterfall made me itchy. You're always itchy, baby. / Why say like that? OK, I'll bathe you later. It's the one that makes smelly. Oh, dried fish! Hey, look. What's this place?/ Where? Looks like a place for fish processing. Itchy. / Itchy, right? The shower's working. It's also clean. Not smelly, right?/ Yeah, not smelly. Not smelly. / Baby, I wanna have a shower. OK, baby. / We'll have a shower. / OK./ Come on. Cang, you go out. / Yeah, please get out. I'm also itchy. I wanna take a shower too. Come on, Cang. / I wanna have a bath. Yeah, I'm leaving. / My clothes are in your bag. Take it. / Yeah. Come on, Cang. Keep your eyes here. You didn't hear what your girl said? Only you left. I just wanna have a bath here. Come on. I wanna talk seriously, you know. Let's go. Well, Cang. I have a plan to make a program on the ship tonight. But, by the way, you still envy? Cang, though we're still... Cang? No, no, no! No! Don't be too fast, Cang! So, what did you say? The water is very cold. / Yeah. Icang!/ Hey, Icang! How very dirty of you! Icang! Swear you're very annoying!/ Icang, your bad habit! How dirty! I'll slap you!/ How dare he! OK. Hurry up! Wait a sec. You just go first. Bro. / Hi, girls. She's still inside. / In the bathroom? Hurry up. / How are they? Let them be. They can return by themselves. Milo's given the signs. Let's go to the ship. Come on. They'll have fun. / That's right. Oh, baby. You scared me. I'm annoyed. / You're cheating. You cleaned yourself first. Why not ask me to have a shower? Wanna have a shower together?/ Of course. OK, baby. Let's go out. / Yeah, come on. Feeling uneasy to be seen by the others. OK. Let's go. Cang, watch those newlyweds. We go first. / Why me? Amy, just stay here. Cang, you know? I've 4 reasons why I still wanna make friends with you. / What? One, two, three, four. Bram! Stacy! Sir! Dinar! Where've they gone? Bram! Bram? Stacy? Bram! Tiara! We just had a shower. / Where? There's a shower in the factory. Still functioning. Seems like someone lives here. Did you see the old guy and Dinar? They haven't been here since then. Who's that? Bram?! Stacy! Mandy, Mandy! Stacy! Stacy and Bram! Their dead bodies... Stacy, My! I saw a masked man over there. And I don't know who he was. Bram's face and Stacy's... / What are you talking about? You're annoying, you know. / Someone's there! We're tired. We wanna return. Dinar and the old guy. I saw them dead there. / Dinar? Dinar and the old guy are also missing? Cang, you saw that place?/ Don't be kidding. I'm not kidding! I saw Stacy and a guy there. He was killing all of them. Stacy and all our friends! Stacy... Shit! I could do nothing. I could do nothing. I saw them dead there. Shit! Cang! Cang! Get up! Get up! You know where the place is? You know it? Try to start the ship engine. If Icang's right, we don't know how many people there are here. Cang, let's go. / I'll come with you. Mandy! No!/ I must go since I brought them here. Mandy, you can't go!/ You're not my Mom and you won't be. Lo! Darling, Mandy?!/ That's OK. I'll watch over them. Just hold this. It'll be getting dark. But if you join us, it'll be darker. You can, right? I'm sure you can overcome your fear. Be careful, OK. Be careful! What's it? If we're cheated and fooled around, I'll kill him! Mayday! Mayday! Sea King here. We're in the Sunda Kelapa islands. The location is the Bride Island. Coordinates... East 10635.2- South 05372. Emergency! Emergency! Mayday! Sea King here! Mayday! Emergency! Mayday! Mayday! Sir?

I just saw a masked man holding a sharp bamboo... No! A sharp iron!/ How many people? I don't know. I just saw that. Cang, we did nothing here, right? Wait, Milo! Milo, what're you gonna do? Hey! What the heck is this? Get me down, bastard! Damn! Milo! Milo!/ What's he doing to you? What the hell are you doing that? Hey, let him go! Let him go! You bastard! Hey, you bastard! Let go of him! Milo! Milo! What do you want, Bastard! What do you want? Milo! Milo, get up! Milo! What do you want? Milo! What do you want? Milo! Milo! Milo! Milo! Milo...! Go! Run! Come on, run! Milo? Milo? Wake up, darling. Wake up! Why are we stopping?/ Where are we running to? Oh my! It's too bad! There's no back door!/ Back door? Run! Run! Hurry up! Milo? Milo? Mandy, Mandy? Don't know where Mandy is. We were separated just now. Let your fiancee be at the waterfall for a while. What do you want? What have I done wrong? Let's get away. Hurry up!
