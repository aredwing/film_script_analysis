Like I said, we have a friend lost in the mountains, will help to find him. We think we are trying cross the border on foot. We will need the right equipment. If we are to those mountains without supplements, we're screwed. The sheriff has equipment enough for everyone. Good And the girl? It will only slow us down, let's leave it here. That's right, the girl ... Yeah, I thought about it. I noticed that you ... is a decent guy, a girl ... come with us, because God forgive me, if you do something, her blood is in your hands. You understand? Yes Well OK, let's take things and leave. We will use the truck Sheriff. Okay, I'm getting a signal. Just move on. That makes sense, there is a trail at the base of the mountain.

And so will delay our friend too. Here one can survive three weeks without food, but only three days without water. That reminds me I gotta pee. Do not get lost. So you will do something or not?

"I thought we were friends? "I'm not your friend. If you need to help them, whatever. But the next person who touches my daughter is dead. Okay, Man of the Mountain. Why do not we point the way? North. We go to the north. "You go first. Rest in peace, motherfucker. The road is a little ahead. What is this? Campers, Rangers, different people, they ... They use ropes and hang those bags in the trees. -To keep the looters away. "What's inside? Probably nothing. There's nobody else here. Hey! The more we walk before stopping? I'm losing my breath. Is. We walked until I tell you to stop. I have cramps. Geary, you're always complaining. Jensen does not see complaining. He just keeps his mouth shut. That's because Jensen did not has no bone in his body. I'll prove it to you. Hey, Jensen, what are you thinking now? -Now? -Yes. The many ways I have to break you. That was not very pleasant, Jensen. -Geary, want some more? Yes, that would be great. What a shame. You are a true piece of shit, Jensen. -Geary, beware. -Run! Tested well. Banks! The girl!

Got here and smoked a cigarette. Bad habit. Yeah, that'll kill him. He tied the wound with the belt of Walt. Hey, how do you know all this? -Magic. What do you think? He is trained. Do the math. We have not won that amount of money. The bastard told me he was going fishing. Your face is reached. He fell down the slope. He's wandering, be easy to track. That's good ... very good. Lawson! We're going to get you, motherfucker! -There he is. "You're doomed. Take care, can turn around. Hey, Lawson has not the trouble of getting up. "Son of a bitch! It's good to see you too, honey. Where's the money, Lawson? -He's gone. What do you mean? -How did you leave? -It is. Become history. There you are wanting to catch him. And if I can not stay with them, you certainly can not.

I should not have done but did, happened. It's okay ... Put the gun away. Okay? Banks do not look at me like that. I've seen that look before. Sorry. I'll put it here. Save it. What will you do? Wants to kill me? You'll kill me for having placed his hands on that cow? Bye, loser. "I had to kill him. -Fuck him. Once the bears and birds do away with him, all that remain will be the smell of disappointment. There is no need to waste a single bullet. Okay, guys, we need set up camp. -Yes. "No, let's keep moving. Banks, we are all tired. Let's stay here. Banks will not survive if we keep going. You know what? Alright! I want to see how long goes on without me. Beware, Banks. Care. You know what? I'm hungry. "Well. "Let's set up camp. She is his daughter. It took all this time to find out? Okay. Who's the food? Damn, Geary is with the food.
