A couple of days later Mr. & Mrs. show up and I hear this blood curdling scream Coming from my neighbor's house like somebody is being murdered or something, so I go over there and there the lady is. Pointing to the rabbit cage and sobbing like So I go over there. I go to the husband and I'm like Hey what's wrong with her? And he says get this, the rabbit died before they went on vacation.

It's going to be ok. And Kendra is ok. She's back at your house with Quentin, Trevor, and Joe. I know she misses her mom. She's worried about you. In fact, let me call Quentin. I'll get her on the phone ok. Hey Quentin. Yeah she just woke up. Can you get Kendra so she can talk to her. Thanks man. Hey. Hey your mom just woke up, she wants to talk to you. Alright. What's wrong with you. Marcy what's wrong with you? Are you serious? What's wrong with you? Stop it! Hey! Whoa whoa whoa! I didn't meant to push you that hard. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Marcy Don't! Marcy! Marcy! Noooo! Why don't you get me a beer. Watch some TV huh. What's so funny? This. What do you want? Of course they can't hear me. What? Are you a doctor? It's mine! Give it back. Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Don't Don't worry! I'm not infected like the rest of those people. What about him? I don't know about him. He's dead. He's been dead for several hours. Wait, do I know you? Have we met before? No, why? Kendra. Who's that? Kendra's my daughter. I left her with some friends. We need to go save her. Do not go back there. Please. I'm sorry but, she's as good as dead. You think Jackie boy's got any weapons? He's got a couple guns in the bedroom. Fucking get them then. But why Quentin? Cause we're going fucking hunting dammit. Don't tell me what to fucking do! Go get the fucking guns. Gonna catch us some dinner. What are we gonna hunt? I'm sorry but your daughter is probably affect and so are your friends. Affected with what? Why would you say that? You're born on leap year right? Yeah. How do you know that? I over heard you at the desk when you were handing them your ID. People who are born on leap year don't seem to be affected. Why do you think that people born on leap year are safe? Cause I was born on leap year and I haven't gone crazy. Just everyone else has and it seems to affect the youngest the fastest. Affected with what? And does it affect the youngest the fastest? With all this craziness and this violence I know because of my nephew. What happened with your nephew? What was I suppose to do? He tried to kill me. I had to defend myself. Ok Ok, if he tried to kill you it's not your fault. It's not. Yes it is. Yes it is. You just don't understand. Because of the choices I made. My nephew will never be with me again. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever. Have you ever had to bury a child? It's surreal. You think that... All these memories come rushing in. It should be me in that bed not him. Don't say that. No no no no. No no no no. Don't say that. Ok. Listen Listen. Then you have to understand why I need to go save my daughter. You do realize that she's probably affected right? I don't care. What kind of father would I be if I didn't at least try. Right? I have to do this. What's your name? Candice. Ok. Candice. I'm Jack. Thanks for saving my ass out there. I'm sure you would have done the same thing for me. Yeah. Ok. I gotta go. I got to go save my daughter. If you're gonna save your daughter your gonna have to have a plan. How many friends did you say you left her with? Do they have any access to weapons? Did you get the fucking guns? Yeah I did. You ain't going to fucking shoot me. How do you know? Cause you ain't got any fucking bullets. Now stop laughing like an idiot. Get over here and help me load these. How do you know they're crazy? Well it seems to affect people differently. Some come in and out of crazy. Some have multiple personality disorder or PTSD. One common thing though is, everyone is incredibly violent towards one another It's like the aggression has been cranked up to 100. How do you it wasn't something in the hospital? Like a gas leak or something? Because it's everywhere. And it started this morning. I don't want to take any risks. I just want to stay in this room and you should too. It's to safe out there. No no no, we need to get out of here. It's not safe! Alright? Everyone has gone crazy! What is crazy? Define crazy. You watch the news today? And even suicidal. There are riots in the streets And people are just going fucking crazy! Aah! Aah! Dammit [Gun shot to TV Ha! Whoo! This is what I'm telling you. It affects people differently at different speeds. Some of them are straight into crazy. And some of them it's a moment to moment thing. But you know the media is full of shit. So at least we know that you and I aren't crazy. Maybe there might be more people like this, like my daughter. Ok, was she born on leap year? No. Then she's crazy. Common get out of here with that. You ok? I'm just a little cold. Fuck this number! What number? You know what don't worry about it, if I tell you you'll think that I'm crazy. Considering the situation you and I are the most sane people here. This say number 13. Everywhere I go. Everywhere I turn around. I see 13-13-13. In clocks, calendars, room numbers, in my dreams, and now on the thermostat. We don't even use Celsius in America! That's what I've been trying to tell you. Today is 13-13-13. It's what? Oh Shit! What's 13-13-13? You won't even believe me if I try to explain it. Look at this point and time I'll believe just about anything. Alright. So leap year wasn't just to add a date to the end of February After 120 years it was it was suppose to add an entirely add a new month. Mathematically speaking today is 13-13-13. So your saying February 29th is not suppose to exist? No. Oh so it's just my luck. So my birthday is not suppose to exist? Yep! And you say that it makes these people overly aggressive? Does it make them suicidal? No no. they are just violent towards each other. Not to themselves. Ok. What you're saying makes sense but there is just one flaw in your theory. Oh yeah what? My ex wife, she committed suicide. Now how do you explain that? I don't know? Maybe I was wrong. Maybe you are wrong about other things like my daughter. Look I'm going with or without you. I want you to come with me, are you gonna come? Yes. Come here. It's time for you physical. Oh god. How long do you think that door is gonna hold? Not long. We got to go now. Do you have any ideas? We can't through the window because we are on the 3rd floor. We have to go through that door. No there's just too many people- Then we're going to fight through them. I don't think I could do it. Let's go! There's no way we could go through there ok? I mean, we can't even see beyond the door. Ok look I have to go get my daughter so we gotta get out of here. No No- Look around and see if you can find some type of weapon or something, alright? Hurry up! Hurry Up! Alright, I'm looking! What about this? That's great. That's great! What are you doing? Trying to see if the coast is clear. That's 13 motherfucking kills! Dammit they're still out there. But I think we can take them. Maybe we should just wait. No no no. Let's get out of here. We have to go, I have to leave this room. I have to take you with me. I leave if I have to. I'm not gonna let the only other person who's not crazy die. Ok? Alright? Ok, come on. - Ok. - Ok. Let's go. Ok. On the count of 3 open that door. If anybody comes in slam it shut behind them. We gotta take them out 1 by 1. What if no body comes in? We gotta make a break for it. We have 3 levels of this hospital to clear. Alright? You ready? Will I ever be? That's a good point. Alright, look. I told you I'd the care of you. Why? Cause you saved my ass back there, Alright. Thanks Jack. On my count. One. Two. How could you fix that thing? What thing? Don't worry about it. Ok on my count. One. Two. Three! Ok, coast is clear. Alright, good. I am going to fucking kill you! Knife? You ain't no fun! I like to use my hands. It's much more personal. Fucking die! Get off me! Aah! Fucking bitch! Huh! You like that? Huh? You think your daughter is safe? Huh! Jack! Jack! Jack! He's dead. You ok? Yeah yeah I'm ok. Let's go. The whole fucking world has gone crazy. Oh yeah. Did you see the news? They're killing each other out there. Why does my stomach hurt? Awe fuck. Why am I bleeding? Shit. You are bleeding. What happened? Joe go to the kitchen. Get yourself cleaned up. Joe go to the kitchen. Get yourself cleaned up. You're bleeding bad. Joe. Fucking respond to me when I'm talking to you huh! Go get yourself cleaned up or else fucking shoot you. Keep it the fuck down! You want the crazy fucks outside to hear you? It's ok. Its not that big a deal. I'm gonna take care of it later. Shut your fucking mouth! Boy. Don't you EVER tell me what to do. You may be my brother, but that don't give you a pass! You understand? We're clear? Crystal. Are you going to put that fucking gun down? Not until we're clear. I just said we were clear. I wasn't paying attention. Say it again! No! Say it the fuck again! Keep it down- it's like you don't even care. You know, you're right. I don't care. Look around soldier! Laughing] I got one. I'm proud of you private! Really? I'm as proud as your girlfriend when you got your red wings soldier. I'm just happy to be in the battalion sarg! At ease soldier! We have a group of hostiles trying to ambush our base. We have the right and left lane protected. We got to protect the front. We don't know what they are capable of. And they have weapons! We need to get some boards and board up these windows. Protect out fort. Go get'em Joe. I got you right there. I got you. Ah. I got you. Ha! I got you covered Joe. Stay close behind me. Ok. Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh Perfect! Good call. Falling from the sky!

What floor? Ground level. Wait wait wait wait. We need a plan first. Yeah ground level. Where did you park? I didn't. I took an ambulance in. Shit. What what's wrong? So did I. How are we suppose to get to your house then? We sure can't get there on foot. I know that! Well? Let me think. Ok? I got it. We need a bag. We need to collect all the car keys of the dead doctor's pockets. Why? Because their doctors that means they drove to work. Their cars must be in the garage. Ok. Sounds like a plan. Ok. Hit 3. Why? We should take the stair well. On top of getting all those keys we should go through the hospital on foot. Are you crazy? No as crazy as going to a level we haven't checked out. What if we get down there, the doors open and we are surrounded by hundreds of them? We'll be trapped. Right? We need to sneak through the hospital to avoid them. Alright. Level 3 it is. Ok. Ok wait here I'm going to get the keys off the receptionist pocket. Ok, look for a bag just in case we have to collect a whole bunch of them. Ok good thinking. Hey take this. No you keep it to defend yourself. Or in case I need to save your ass for a 3rd time? Yeah Ok. Too many of those guys come get in the elevator, hit the hold button like I showed you before. You'll be safe there. Well what about you? I'll be fine. I just go that knife that crazy lady dropped. See. Ok. Alright. Back in 2 seconds. Ok, let's go. Looks like we're home free. Looks like it. Let's go Let'sgo! Run! Lock the door! It's locked. Laughing] Whoo! Look at me I'm a doctor! Come here, it's time for your physical! Ok, grab the keys from the doctor's pockets. Put them in your purse. We got to get out of here. And we'll run to the parking garage? Exactly. We can't go back to the stair well. And do it quick. Pepper spray only last 10 minutes on those guys. How do you know that? I use to be a cop. Like before this whole thing happened? No I left the force 4 months ago. Why was that? Nice catch. Don't change the subject. Don't you think it's better if we didn't know much about each other? You know, just in case. I don't think I want to be in a world with a whole bunch insane people anyway. I believed that way my whole life. Just talk. I - I was kicked off due to excessive force. What happened? My partner Quentin and I were staking out this Meth lab. I saw this guy in a hoodie come out the meth lab and around the back. Then I heard a woman screaming. Yelling stop. So I got out the car to go check it out, Now Quentin told me don't do it. He said I was bowing our cover. But I did it anyway. So as I'm running around the back, I see the purp. on top of her Her close were torn to shreds, And her face was smashed in. Her eyes were swollen shut. But she was still crying. I could hear her. So I grab the purp, I pull him off of her, and all I saw was red. Next thing I know I was on top of him. I had beaten his face in with, my bare hands. I killed him. She was only 17 years old. So, the girl lived. That sick fuck died. I lost my job and my wife. Hey. We've got enough keys. Come on.
