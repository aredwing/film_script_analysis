We're getting married? In the dream. So, somehow, I managed to escape and make it back to my parents' house. But then I realized I didn't know which shoes to wear. So, I just grabbed a bunch. And then I was running through Prospect Park to get to Queens. Prospect Park's in Brooklyn. I know. But it's a dream. You know, like, it's dream logic or something. I don't dream. Shut up. That's why I burn. No, that's why you don't remember your dreams. So, you were running through Prospect Park... I was running. And, uhh, and... I don't speak Spanish. No Spanish. Look, can I have some "D" batteries, please? Can I have a bag? Yo, let me get a couple coffees, man, four sugar. I'll be back. Thank you. Grilled chicken sandwich. Thanks. Lyle, you got to slam the fucking door? See what we got here. Stereo and a couch. Dude, this fucking eczema's killing me. Yo. You think you might roll the window down? Give me a second. Maybe before you fucking light it. Can't do that and light it. We're good. We're good. We're good. You put your fucking jerk-off pants on today. Always wear my jerk-off pants. Come on, I got a fucking piss test. Can you roll it down a little more? Yo, you see this motherfucker? Oh, shit. Remember doing shit like that when you were a kid? What? Stealing 40s and shit.

When you come back from a long trip, you feel like... smarter, like, more grown, not, like, older, but, like, more mature. The time difference alone changes our whole body's chemistry. And we all use, like, what, like, 12% of our brain, right? So, who's to say, when we're in India, we're not activating the Indian part here? Breathing in Indian air, you're drinking like an Indian. You're Indian. But you're you. You know what I mean? That's some Wu-Tang shit. Got it dripping like it's marble cake. If you could live anywhere in the world-- The Galapagos. "The Galapagos"?
