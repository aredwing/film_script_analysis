Tomorrow. - Tomorrow, when? - Tomorrow night. But we've got a 2:00 appointment with Frank and Hinkle. Now, don't be a pest, Cliff. I haven't seen my sister in two years. She got married and I haven't even met her husband. I can't... I can't show the new summer line without a model. Show them on hangers. Hangers haven't got what you've got. Hangers. A piece of wood, a hunk of wire. That won't sell dresses. - Hey, what are you doing? - Taking a present to my sister. - She got married. Do you mind? - A present? You're picking out a whole trousseau. What's a few samples? I've gotta account for every item. What am I gonna tell the home office? Tell them you ran into Jesse James. I thought after we got rid of the buyers we could have a quiet dinner together. Just you and me. There's a cute French restaurant in Riverport. Look, Cliff, don't you ever give up? You made a pitch in Baltimore, a wrong play in Mobile and you fouled out in Atlanta. Cliff, in any league, three strikes is out. You got 10 minutes, folks. Ten minutes. You're a good girl, I know, and I respect it highly. - But do you have to be so fanatic about it? - You're overselling. I wonder where I can find a phone? Why did your sister have to pick a dead end like this for a home? It's very simple. She wanted to be near her husband and he works here. A wilderness. Very nice people live here and they go to church on... Hey, give me a nickel. You got a nickel? Rice, Rice, Rice. - Give me a pencil. - Clam-digger. Here, hold this. - Sir, where can I get some cigarettes? - The machine. - The machine. - Right. Pretty soon they won't need people like us. They're mechanizing everything. Not everything. They don't answer. Maybe she moved. No, I got a letter from her a couple of weeks ago, says she's working nights in the Recreation Center. The Recreation Center? You know, it's one of those places where they have a caf and a bowling alley. They don't bowl around here. They sleep. Do you know where it is? I think lll take a cab. - You got a cigarette? - Come on, folks, time. Let's get rolling. - Hey, you said 10 minutes. - Come on, let's go. Come on. Hey, give me my cigarette! Oh, take the whole pack. lll see you tomorrow. Baker Hotel, Riverport! Baker Hotel. Come on, come on! - Where's the cab driver? - He ain't around. - But his cab's right there. - There's no driver. - Mister, could you tell... - Look, they're trying to close up. - What's the matter, can't he talk? - What do you want, lady? Well, ld like to find the Recreation Center. Do you know where it is? - The Valley Caf and bowling... - Yeah, - Ten blocks... - You won't miss it. - No cab driver, huh? - Straight up the street. Its a real friendly town. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Check this, check this for me, please. Here, lady. Take this quick. Hey, what's going on around here, anyway? Come on, we got to get out of here. Come on. - Hey, cab driver, take me home. - Just soon as I finish my drink. - Why did you give him credit? - He's my secret lover, that's why. - Take out the jungle rhythm record. - Leave it in. It always gives me migraine headache. Out! Brings in the nickels. Yes, honey? Does Lucy Rice work here? - Who's the boss here, me or my wife? - I said leave it in. You want Lucy? You didn't marry me, you married the business. And we're very happy together. Oh, she's here somewhere. Just look around, honey, you'll find her. What about jungle rhythm, in or out? Marsha! So wonderful to see you. What are you doing in Rock Point? I have most wonderful news to tell you. lm gonna have a baby. Isn't that marvelous? I just talked to the doctor... Well, what's the matter? Aren't you glad? Oh, yes, Lucy. Lucy, I just saw a man murdered. Murdered? You're kidding? They dragged him out of the jail, and then they beat him and then murdered him. - Who? When? - Just now. A whole mob of them. A gang. - And they were all dressed in hoods. - Hoods? - I was walking down the street, and I... - Jeepers! It must have been that fellow. Lucy, lm looking for you. The drinks they ordered. - This is my sister, Marsha, Mr. Athens. - Oh. The sister from New York. She talks about you all the time. She's proud. lm very pleased - to make your acquaintance. - How do you do? I know. You two kids wanna be alone. Such a long time, you didn't see each other. You got a lot to talk over. Go home, go home. lll take care of the order. - Thanks, Mr. Athens. - You know, young lady, it ain't right. She is all you've got in the world, your own sister, flesh and blood. You should keep in touch more often. - Thanks for the night off, Mr. Athens. - That's okay. What do you think? Go home. Go, go, go. Lucy, what were you gonna say, just now? I was just gonna tell you, that must have been that fellow Adams. - Adams? - The one that was murdered, the reporter. He came here two or three weeks ago and got a job at the phone company, but he was really writing articles against the Klan, and they caught him. - Caught him? - Yes, they arrested him and put him in jail. Of course, they said it was for drunken driving or something, I don't know. But the whole town's been talking about nothing but this for days. Oh, Lucy, it was just horrible. I feel I should do something about it, but I don't know what to do. - Let's go home. - Lucy, see those men over there? They were at the jail. Are you sure? Yeah. Let's go home and see Hank. He'll tell you what to do. Come on. Could you park it? - You all through with him? - All yours. Its funny, no crowds. They're wise. They know enough to stay away. - Take him to the hospital? - Morgue's across the street. What'd this guy wanna come down here for in the first place? What they don't seem to understand is we folks get along all right. So long as nobody starts interfering with us in Washington. Points north. Adams didn't come from Washington. He worked for a paper in Birmingham, and that's not north. He used to do a pretty good sports column. Knew a lot about football. They left this. - Where's Walters? - Down at the bus station. Looks like the diner and some of those places across the street closed a little early tonight. Yeah. Check up on them, Shore. See what the excuse is this time. Okay. - What does he think he's gonna do? - Well, you know, go through the motions. He's a county prosecutor. He'll prosecute. - Rainey will get no place. - Tell you what, Tommy. lll go to the races with you tomorrow on one condition. We use your car. Tomorrow is my wife's turn. You know her. Yes? Well, they came in. A guy with a shotgun come up. "Get down on your gut," he says, "On the floor." Well, he had a shotgun, I got down. "Where are the keys?" he says. "Go look," I told him. - Who was in here? - I was. "Which cell is Adams in?" he says. I wouldn't tell him. "Go look," I said. Then I got it in the back of the head. - Who was it? - What? Come again? The guy with the shotgun. The other fellows. Come on, Ernie, who were they? What's the matter this time? Too dark in here? All happened too fast? Maybe you didn't recognize any of them, never saw them before in your life? That's right. You realize as the deputy, you're sworn to protect your prisoners. You know, I could hold you as an accessory to murder. Okay, hold me. Accessory to murder. You better go with him. Better get that head X-rayed. Don't tell me my job. I know my job. Ernie knows who dragged Adams out of here. So do I. So do you, Burt, when it comes right down to that. It was the Klan. What about it? Well, a man got killed. Something's got to be done about it. All right, tell me what. lll do what you say. That's what lm here for. You wanna start naming names, Mr. Rainey? lll pull them in, if you name them. - That's not good enough, Art. - Well, that's all there is. I take orders. You give me an order, lll do it. You know anybody in Rock Point that will go to the inquest for you and testify against the Klan? Tell me, and lll bring them in. If you don't, and you don't, stop kicking my men around for not doing what you can't do yourself. I know. But every time someone from New York, Washington, or points north, starts poking his nose in our affairs, we holler foul. Well, if we don't want the meddling, one of these days we're gonna have to start cleaning up our own messes. You and me. All of us. How far did you get eight months ago with that lynching? About as far as lll get with this one. Thought you might wanna see him, Burt. - I was in bed. He got me out of bed. - Hello, Frank. The night bus was supposed to stop 10 minutes. - It didn't. It left right away. - I have nothing to do with the bus stops. I just handle the baggage. You know that, Mr. Rainey. lm just a baggage man. - You were there when the bus pulled out? - Yes, sir. About three minutes later a man was killed. He told me about that. I suppose... Yes, sir. You didn't see anything? Hear anything? Please, Mr. Rainey, don't ask me any questions. I don't wanna lie to you. lm a family man just like you see me. I love my kids. I gotta protect them. A mob that did what those people did tonight, would burn me up like that. I ask you, what would you do in my place? Tell the truth. Could you afford to get involved? - Let him go. - lm sorry. But what they did tonight, believe me, I hate it. It made me sick. I don't know, maybe lm just a coward. - Maybe I just use my family as an excuse... - All right, Frank, all right. Believe me, Mr. Rainey, lm sorry. - He's got a case. - Everybody's got a case. Nobody saw anything. Nobody heard anything. It' s a shame Adams' body keeps getting in the way. I don't know who's the guiltier, the one who commits the crime or the one who just stands by and refuses to do anything about it. Sometimes, I sit around for hours trying to figure that one out. Take Jaeger in there. He makes allowances for the Klan. He's really against guys like Adams, yet he gets his head broke trying to protect him. Complicated, isn't it? Here we are trying to find a bunch of murderers. When we find them, who will they be? Probably friends of ours, fellows we went to school with. - You a member of the Klan, Walters? - I used to be. - You're kidding. - Fact. Why'd you join? I thought it was something to do good. You know, help people. Get them out of trouble, keep them out. I wanted to help people. What do you know about that. Why'd you quit? I found out it was a lot of bunk. Just a racket. Bunch of hoodlums dressed up in sheets. - Going to go ahead with it, Burt? - Oh, sure. Gum? You can sleep on the couch, Marsha. See, this opens up into a day bed. Well, it's really more comfortable than it looks. Looks all right. Of course, I could ask Hank to sleep on the couch and then you could sleep in bed with me. Oh, no. Don't do that. Oh, it's Hank. He's home early. Yeah, lm mad about him. Oh, he's so wonderful. Hank. Hank. - Don't do that, honey. Stop. - What? - What for? - Company. Oh. Hey, no company, hon. lve been out wrestling that truck all night. I wanna hit the sack. Its my sister. My sister Marsha's here. Oh, why didn't you say so in the first place? Come on. Hey, what do you do when you meet your wife's sister? Do you shake hands with her? Do you kiss her? - I don't know, what? - You kiss her, silly. Hey, this calls for a little celebration, huh? Right. Marsha, come on. Go ahead, kiss her. Its legal. Well. Gee, I heard all about you from Lucy, but I didn't know you looked like... Oh, holding out on me, huh? You know, you never did tell me she was such swell hunk of equipment. I told you she was pretty. Hey, hon. Them drunken mice have been at it again. He marks the bottle to see if lm nipping. Well, she shouldn't ought to drink so much, should she, Marsha? Did you hear what happened at the jail? No. No, I was out on the road driving the truck. Oh, yeah. Yeah, they told me about it down at the mill - when I was putting the truck away. - Marsha saw it. Did she? - What did you see, Marsha? - The whole thing. She was right there. Did you see who done it? No, she was so frightened, she just ran away. Good. You didn't see who done it, huh? Well, she just tried to get out of there as fast as she could. And besides, they were wearing hoods. She didn't get to see anything. Outsiders. That's who killed him. Outsiders, hiding in Klan robes. And then they blame us. We're lynchers. You wait and see, when it all comes out, it was outsiders. Say when. Hey! Nothing at all? Give you a lift. Do you good besides helping you. Not a drinking woman, huh? Well, that's smart. People drink too much. You know, that's probably how it all happened. - What? How what happened? - That trouble tonight. A bunch of guys got loaded and, you know, they probably didn't want to kill that guy at all. They just probably figured on scaring him and, you know, just scare him out of town. And then one of the guys got excited and, wham! Well, that's probably how it happened. What's the matter? Did I do something wrong? Did I say something? Honey. What do you keep looking at me like that for? - Hank, please. - Well, I don't care. I don't go for these outsiders staring down their noses at us. - Honey. - What is she, anyway? Nothing, but a model. A dress model. Running around half-naked all the time and letting men slobber over her. Hank, she's got nothing against you. She's tired. The bus trip. After what she saw tonight, it's enough to make anybody sick. Leave her alone. lm sorry, honey. I guess I had it all wrong. Excuse me. - What got into you, baby? - I said lm sorry, honey. I didn't realize. Will you go to bed? Will you, please? I ain't hard to get along with. Its just that... I guess, I kind of flew off the handle a little. Good night. You were staring at him. Lucy, I hate to have to tell you this, but he was one of them. - What are you talking about? - I saw him. He was with the rest of them when they shot that fellow in the back. - Hank wasn't there, he was working. - Oh, yes, he was. He told us he wasn't... Is it true? Is it true what Marsha said? I was on the road, driving the truck. Just like I told you. Call them up. Call them up at the mill. Look at my time card. Don't listen to her, hon. She just wants to start trouble. You're lying. I saw you. I was standing in a doorway, not 10 feet away from you. All right, I was there. He came looking for trouble and he got it. - Why, Hank? - Forget it. Nothing's gonna happen. She ain't gonna say nothing. What were you doing there? I don't know how it happened. I was down at the mill loading the truck and these fellows come along, and they were going down to the jail to scare this Adams. And I didn't wanna go along. It was... Well, you know how it is, we were drinking and I couldn't back out, not in front of all them guys. So I went along just to scare him. That's all, believe me. Its been burning inside of my stomach ever since. I can't stop seeing it. I didn't wanna do anything. Honest. - Where are you going? - lm going out. I can't sleep now. Not after what happened. I wanna walk. Take this. Its cold. You heard what he said. He had to go along. But he wouldn't hurt anyone. He couldn't hurt anyone. Oh, Marsha, I love him so much. Oh, baby. I understand. I understand. lll catch the first bus out in the morning and get out of this. I should be in Riverport anyway. Everything will be just the way you want it. - Hi, Glen. - Good evening, Burt. Hello, Mr. Rainey. - Hi, Cliff. - Hi, Mr. Rainey. What your man got there? We picked it up at the jail. Heard there was a shooting. Who was it? They meant to lynch him. Something went wrong, I guess. Oh? Who was it? They use this kind of rope on trucks, don't they? Tie-off rope. Use it on my trucks all the time. Matter of fact, that's where we got this one. At your mill. They match. Exactly the same. Beer stains. Just had this suit cleaned, too. - Water take off beer stains? - I think so. Here. A man can buy a rope like that in any hardware store in the state. This is bad business, Burt. What are you trying to do? - Work up a case. - You won't. You can't, you know it. Those hotheads, whoever they were, killed a reporter. The newspapers are going crazy about it. You're helping them. He has to do his duty, Mr. Faulkner. That's what he's paid for. Every train, every bus will be bringing more reporters for the inquest, ready to smear Rock Point all over the country. It'll make a stink you can smell from here to Canada, and you're helping them. What do you want from him? Its his duty. His duty is to his own folks, his own town, people who elected him. It isn't his duty to make us all ashamed that we live here. Its his job. A man has to do what's right. Walter Adams was a pretty good reporter, wasn't he, Charlie? A good reporter could dig up a lot of stuff about the Klan, couldn't he? Might even say it was all a phony. A private moneymaking racket. Maybe he could prove it, too, if he lived long enough. Look, did I kill this Adams? lll give you a tip, young fellow. Never go off half-cocked. Who's to say the Klan's involved? You got a witness? Don't drag people into anything unless you got solid legal evidence. Everything that happens in these small towns, right away they blame the Klan. - George. - Yes, Mr. Barr? Yes? - Where was I tonight? - Here. - When did I come in? - 9:00, thereabouts. - When did I leave? - Leave? Leave, Mr. Barr? You're still here. You never left for a minute. Your bowling score on the sheet there proves it. George, every time you tell that story you get better. You go right ahead. Look for evidence. Get your witnesses. Don't let nobody stop you. Mr. Barr. Mr. Barr. I told you to go home and stay there. I know, but I found out something. Somebody seen us. - Who saw us? - That's what I come here to tell you about. My wife's sister came in on the 10:00 bus and she seen me. She recognized me. She seen all of us. But it's all right. I took care of it. She's gonna leave town. First bus in the morning. That's all Rainey needs. One witness, one person who saw it. I just told you I took care of it. She ain't gonna do nothing. I didn't have to come down here and tell you, did I? But I did. Don't you worry. I know what lm doing. - She'll be on that first bus in the morning. - Make sure of it. Be as sure of that as you've ever been about anything, or you'll find this whole mess dumped right into your lap. Mr. Barr, we was all there together. Not just me. You will be left alone with it if anything goes wrong. Get your sister-in-law out of town. - All right, all right, we're... - Well, hurry up! Hank's always in a hurry. What the matter? You want to be late? There ain't gonna be another... You go get in the other side. There ain't gonna be another bus here until way late tonight. Well, hurry up! Come on. All right, folks. Everyone onboard. Driver, will you wait for me? I still have to get my... Gotta keep off Main Street when you head out, Al. Yeah, why? Chief wants to keep all traffic clear of the courthouse. The whole town's turning out for the inquest. - Official red tape baloney. - Yeah, I heard all about it. Its getting to be a regular happening around here. Why don't you put up a grandstand and sell tickets? Peddle popcorn. Go east, see. Hit the highway off Tyler Street. Straight east on Tyler. lll do that. Come on, come on, lady, if you're going with us. Oh, you get my ticket and lll get my suitcase. Please. Is that your suitcase? That's right. Heading there at 2:00. All right, call me if you get anything. Call me later. This is the girl who checked her suitcase, Burt. Marsha Mitchell. Won't you sit down, Miss Mitchell? Rainey speaking. That's right. lll call you back. Miss Mitchell, you got off the bus at 10:00 last night. - Yes. - Where did you go? To the Recreation Center. My sister works there. - The Valley Caf and Recreation Center? - Yes. Then you passed the jail. You must have seen what happened. Yes, as I passed the jail I knew something horrible was going on, but I couldn't see it. I couldn't see who did it, or anything like that. You, too? You know, Miss Mitchell, the people who live around here never see anything or hear anything. I thought that you being a stranger in town might have better eyesight. in fact I thought you might be willing to tell us what you saw. - Are you in town on business? - No, I came to visit my sister. - Your sister? - Lucy Rice. Rice. Rice. Hank Rice. He works at the mill, Burt. And it's his wife? Yes. Mr. Rainey, the firm I work for doesn't know I stopped off here and my job depends upon my being in Riverport this afternoon at 2:00. - So, if you'd be so... - lm sorry. We'll be as brief as we can. This is your baggage check. The stamp at the time machine, one minute. Two minutes later a man was killed. You were near the jail, heard shots, screams. You didn't see anyone running? I told you I couldn't see anyone because they were all covered. Covered? Wearing hoods, white robes. Like this? Yes, that's why I couldn't possibly identify anyone or recognize anyone because they were all covered up. lm sorry, Miss Mitchell. You'll have to remain for the inquest at 2:00 this afternoon. But why? What could I possibly say that would... Just tell them what you saw. That they were wearing Klan robes. All right, I will if you want me to, but as I said, I couldn't recognize anyone. Mr. Rainey, my job depends upon - my being in Riverport... - Miss Mitchell. ...this afternoon... - A man has been murdered. We won't hold you any longer than we have to. Get us a subpoena for her, Walt. We'll send a car for you at 2:00 this afternoon. What happened? Everything okay? What did they do? - Well, nothing. Nothing. - Are you sure, Marsha? - Yes. - What did you tell Rainey? That it was dark and that I couldn't see anybody. - Did he believe you? - Well, he let me go, didn't he? We'll take you to Riverport. No, I have to wait around now for the inquest. The inquest? What for? Well, I don't know, but that's what Mr. Rainey wants. What are you gonna say? Look, take your hands off of me. We can't talk about this now, anyway. Look, I asked you something. What are you gonna say? Well, what do you think lm going to say? Look, Mr. Rainey doesn't know that I saw you or anybody else. Its just a legal procedure. Now, forget it. Lucy, you take the car and drive her home. - Where are you going? - Never mind, just drive her home. - Hi. - Boss wants you. Its all taken care of. Everything's okay. - They got her, huh? - I know. But as soon as the inquest is over, it's over for good. My sister-in-law ain't gonna say nothing about us. They're holding her for the inquest. - She ain't gonna say nothing. - She's going on the stand? What do you think? You think she wants to get me in trouble? Wants to get me hung? That don't make sense to you, does it? I just saw her. Take my word. Charlie. What's the matter? Rainey is subpoenaing a lot of people for the inquest. Deputy Sheriff, Athens, his wife, everybody who locked up early. He's making quite a party of it. You're getting a subpoena, too. Me? That smart guy, what's he trying to pull? He's going to get an indictment, he says. - Against who? - The Klan. Where'd you hear that bull? Barnet's nephew works at the courthouse. He got wind of it. Look, lll tell you what you do. Get up a committee, see Rainey. Set him straight. You know how to do it. You got the looks, dignity, gab. Tell that... He can't indict the Klan. - He thinks otherwise. - He thinks. There's no substitute for evidence. Who has he got to say it was the Klan? Me, you, Adams? Before he can tie the Klan in with the shooting... Charlie, he's no fool. He wouldn't go ahead like this without a witness. Could be. If anyone does put the finger on the Klan, Rainey can subpoena the entire membership. - Put them on the stand. - That'll get him no place. Let's not fool ourselves, Charlie. You know the boys. Without those white hoods to hide in, they're no heroes. That's why they need the hoods in the first place. Put them under fire, legal fire, and you will see a rat race like you've never seen before. They'll squeal, they'll cry, they'll run like rabbits. And get it straight, Charlie. You know why you were so anxious to rush Adams out of town. You know how close he was getting. If Rainey gets that indictment, if he gets the hands on those books, where will we be? in jail serving time for income tax evasion. - Bull! Nobody's going to jail. - All right. Let's not worry about the law. What about the members? What do you think they'll do when they find out how much of their money went into your pocket? Drop it. Initiation fees, insurance, insignia sales, - Klan regalia, dues. - You got yours, too, didn't you? Yes, Charlie, and I don't want to be exposed, either. So maybe we'd both better run while we have time. - Burn the books and run. - lm not running. I worked hard for what I got. You think lm gonna throw it all away, like garbage? I don't have to, because Rainey won't get his indictment. Nobody's gonna talk. Nobody. Rice, come here. Where is she? Your wife's sister? Where is she? Turn, honey. - Is it even all the way around? - Yeah. - Marsha, lm just mad about this. - I knew you'd like it. You better wear it a lot because, you know, pretty soon... Yeah, lm gonna start gaining weight, you mean? - You won't be able to get into it at all. - Do I show yet? - Well, I wouldn't exactly... - Hi! How do I look? Marsha gave me this. - Oh, hello, Mr. Barr. - Hello. This is Mr. Barr, Hank's boss. This is my sister Marsha. Marsha, he wants to talk to you. Marsha, you got to listen to Mr. Barr. You got to. Miss Mitchell, what did you tell Rainey? - Nothing. - You see, just like I told you. She don't want to start no trouble. Do you, Marsha? Look, miss, don't hold out on me. Its important. You said something to Rainey. Something that lit a fire under him. I didn't identify Hank, or you. You were there, too, you know. That's not what we're talking about. You told Rainey it was the Klan, didn't you? You shouldn't have done that. But it's all right as long as you don't say it under oath at the inquest. Got that straight? You're asking me to lie. Yeah, and even go to jail, maybe. Look, I want to help my sister, but that doesn't include your Klan. Your Klan murdered him, you know. It was an accident. We're all sorry about it. You have to think of all the good the Klan does. You have to think of what it would be like down here without us. Without us, a girl like you wouldn't be safe on the street at night. You have to think of that. What about Adams? Yeah, and what about my sister? And what about me? What am I gonna be if I lie on the stand? You better worry about this stupid brother-in-law of yours. Mr. Barr. We didn't go there to kill Adams. Just to scare him out of town. Only birdbrain here lost his head. He did it, not us. He is the one who shot Adams, ask him. Hank, you didn't tell... Mr. Barr! We're all in this together, all of us. That's what you said. Marsha, don't believe him. Get it straight. You say it was the Klan, and I promise you he'll hang. Give them something to go on and they'll be howling for blood. And if it comes to that, he's their meat. Mr. Barr, you always said that what happened... Up to now we've covered up for him, Lucy. But let it get out of hand and we'll turn him over to Rainey ourselves. - Hank. - You! You always said that what happened to one of us - happened to us all. - Get away from me! Figure it out, miss. Think it over. Hank! Hank. I didn't mean to do it. Honest. I had a few drinks and when they brung Adams out of jail I got excited, I guess. He's no good, Lucy. He murdered Adams. You can't possibly stay with him now. Where you going? - You got to stick by me. - Lucy, he's no good. - Don't listen to her. - I don't know. Lucy. - lm going to pack your things, okay? - You gotta stick by me, Lucy. - Okay? - She ain't going! Are you, Lucy? You have to leave him. Somebody's gotta take care of you. lll take care of her. I always have. Listen, don't spoil everything now. All the plans we made. The baby and all. If you run out on me now, they'll hang me. You don't know what you're doing, after what he's done. He isn't bad. ld know if he was. How could you? I don't care what he's done. lm not gonna leave him. Marsha. What are you gonna say? Well, he's taking a shower. Oh. Ring, ring, ring. All that phone has done is ring, - all the time you've been upstairs. - Okay, Mom. Look, Burt, there are You're splitting the town wide open. Bad feeling. We're not defending the Klan. - We don't like it any better than you do. - We're thinking of the town now. Its bad for business, Burt. Christmas is coming on. Fellows that knocked Adams off did it at the wrong time. Is that it? A week after Christmas it would've been all right. You know who you're fighting. A man can be removed, you know. Remove me. You know, I might say thanks. Hello? Hold. Burt, Mr. Pike wants to talk to you. Oh, tell him lll call him later. That phone's been ringing all day. Threats and promises. "Open the inquest and shut it. The quicker, the better. Or else..." "Don't blacken the name of our fair city, Mr. Rainey. Or else..." lve heard everything you could say. Now if you can't think of anything new, I have to get down to the courthouse and get started. You're making a national spectacle out of us. Stick your neck out and believe me, your whole career goes down the drain. If you go on with this, you won't get one vote for dogcatcher next year. - Listen, I don't give a good... - Burt. Look, I know you, all of you. At some time or other there isn't one of you that hasn't tried to help me. You're good men. Decent men. None better anywhere. You've all done me favors and now you're asking me to do something for you. You have a right to. Well, lm turning you down. It isn't easy to go against the advice of men like you. Makes a man wonder whether he's doing the right thing. - But lve got to do it. - But why, Burt? - lf you respect our opinion, why? - Let me ask you something. Whose idea was it for you to come here and see me? Who got up this committee? It was Faulkner, wasn't it? And Charlie Barr. I thought so. You think you're doing right. Well, I think you're doing exactly what the Klan wants you to. But, Burt, believe me, none of us are members of the Klan. Charlie Barr wouldn't have picked you if you were. When it looked as if I wasn't getting anyplace, where were you then? There were no committees, no uproar. The minute I get the Klan on the run, it's inconvenient. "We can't stand the publicity." "Bad for business." "The Christmas rush." A hundred reasons for dropping the whole thing like a hot rock. Well, not for me. Don't come to me carrying Charlie Barr's bundles. I won't be home. You know, the last time I didn't. But the next time he runs for anything, lm going to vote for him. Well, son, what did they offer you? The governor's job or a seat next to me? - Aren't you gonna see the fireworks? - I don't like to see a good man get hurt. - You think lll lose, huh? - Good luck, son. Thanks, Pop. We've been here in Rock Point since 7:00 this morning to report to you the results of the inquest and the reaction of the town. Get off that cable. Many times today on the streets, in the restaurant in the hotel, people have come up to us and asked us not to judge their whole town by the brutal, criminal action of hoodlums last night. Clear that cable. Get off the line. Bob? Bob. These decent individuals, sincerely upset by the ugly flare-up of violence which has brought sudden national prominence to their small town, tell us the great majority of people here, 75, of the Ku Klux Klan or mob rule. That's right, young man. Official studies and authorized social surveys support that view. But looking out at the faces of the men and women here this afternoon at the courthouse, it isn't always easy to tell on which side they stand. No doubt a good part of this crowd is made up of curiosity seekers out for a holiday. Undoubtedly, many of these people here are seriously concerned about the good name of their town, about its future. As you look at them, you can see the deep shame that they feel. Many of these people also feel, however, these respected folk, a serious resentment. A resentment against the press. Against outsiders. Against the national coverage that this inquest is receiving. Why don't you go back where you came from and let us alone? And you can also see plain, ordinary, unadulterated hate. Lots of it. in a town whose streets and show windows already are decorated with bells, with reindeer, holly and season's greetings, there are very angry people here, sullen and hostile. You're a great speechmaker, mister. Why don't you go home? And even your radio reporter speaking to you now won't be surprised if somebody comes up from behind and bops him on the head. So if this microphone suddenly goes dead on you, - you'll know why. - Smart aleck. - You, sir, may I ask you a question? - Nothing to say. - You think they're gonna catch the killers? - Ain't likely. - No? Why not, sir? - A man would be a fool to testify. If I knew something, it'd be awful hard to get it out of me, lll tell you that. Not for $500, or not for all the money in the world. Well, thank you, sir. You see, I was working in the back of the shop... Could you speak in here? Will you talk up, please? Well, I was working in the back of the shop when the driver came in. He was pasty-faced. He was white and scared. The boss took one look and he said, "Did they get him?" And the driver said, "Did they get who?" And the boss said, "You know who." And the driver said, "I don't know what you mean "and I don't want to know." Well, right then and there, I knew that that fellow from the paper was a goner. - And he got it. - Well, thank you. I just spotted the prosecutor coming up, Burt Rainey, the county prosecutor. lll see if we can get him to say something. - Mr. Rainey, will you make a statement? - No, not now. - Your office pick up any leads? - Wait for the inquest. Yeah, you got evidence against the Klan? Gonna be able to get an indictment against the Klan? Wait for the inquest. - Walters get her? - They're on their way now. That was Burt Rainey, as much of him as you were or were not able to hear. Mr. Rainy makes as fine an appearance as any other young county prosecutor, but he was born here in Rock Point. He's lived all his life in Rock Point. - Move. - That's gotta be the mystery witness now. I wonder, could we have your name, please? Be careful what you say, lady. Could you tell us if you're here as a witness for the inquest today? Have you been in town? Have you seen this murder? She's not talking to anybody. Be a little help, will you? Please. lm trying to do a broadcast here. - Would you tell me just... - Out of the way, please. ...whether you plan to testify about the Klan activities, anything such as that? Not smart enough to keep her mouth shut. Apparently, that's our mystery witness. Don't let them scare you, miss. You got to say something, say it. Good afternoon, miss. Hello, Miss Mitchell. Well, this is a day we'll remember for a long time. You know, these people they don't want to do anything. They're afraid they'll involve kinfolk and no one wants to get mixed up in a murder. But lve been plugging for so long and this is it. This is my chance. All I need is your testimony. You just tell them what you saw and lll do the rest. Mrs. Adams. Hello. Now, let's have it quiet, please, and we'll proceed with the inquest. Now, gentlemen, the law says, that a coroner's inquest shall be held without unreasonable delay. lve made the autopsy. The body has just been officially identified by Mrs. Adams there, wife of the deceased. Now, will you hold up your right hands? Right hand. Do you swear to inquire when, where and by what means Walter Adams came to his death? And to inquire into the circumstances attending death, and to render a true verdict thereon? Say, "I do so swear." - I do so swear. - I do so swear. - Come, come, do so swear. - I do so swear. Now. Now, what that all comes to in a nutshell, your verdict is to help the law catch who did it and bring him to justice. Now, first, we've got to prove who's dead and then why. Now, here's my medical report. Walter Adams. Caucasian, male, 39-years-old, 8'... Cause of death: cerebral hemorrhage and contusions due to shotgun wounds of the chest and head. Deputy Sheriff, Arthur Jaeger. Bring that chair over here, Art. We'll use it for the witness. Sit in it. Now, Sheriff, you were in charge of the jail. Yeah, I have a taxi stand across the street from the bus station. You know that, Mr. Rainey. And I suppose just before 10:00 last night you had a call? That's right. That's exactly right. Ed Royle. He gave me a call last night. He was playing poker over at Clyde Marshall's house with some of the boys. And since Ed Royle lives five miles out of town and you were picking him up just about 10:00, you couldn't possibly have been anyplace near the jail. That's right. That's exactly right, Mr. Rainey. - He's a good liar. - Always has been. Ever since high school. As soon as the 10:00 bus pulled out, I finished my work and went straight home. And that's all that happened. That is, as far as I was concerned, as far as what I know about it. And so you closed up a few minutes after 10:00? Yes, sir. You know, of course, that you could lose your job - for closing up before time, don't you? - Yes, but it was an emergency. My wife was sick. That's the truth. - You're sure? - Oh, lm sure lm sure. Yes, sir. Suppose we could prove that this killing was planned down to the last detail. Suppose we could prove that someone came around early and told you to close up. - I tell you, I don't know anything... - lm holding you over on a perjury charge. We'll check on your wife and we'll see what your doctor has to say. - Can he do that? - Course not. You don't usually close your diner until about 2:00 in the morning, do you? That's right, most of the time. But last night I... - Your wife was sick. - Yeah. We had an epidemic of sick wives last night. You know what this is? - Buckshot. - We took it out of Adams' body. - Adams? - You know who Adams was. Yeah, that guy that was arrested for drunk driving. A judge and jury were going to decide whether he was really drunk, or whether he'd been framed. But the mob last night was afraid to wait for the judge and jury. I didn't have nothing to do with it. I ain't done nothing. - Who told you to close up early? - I don't know. I mean, nobody. I told you my wife was sick. lll tell you why you closed up early. Because you were warned to stay out of trouble. Because you were warned not to see anything. That takes a certain amount of planning, doesn't it? That means that you and everyone like you can be guilty of conspiracy. Conspiracy to murder. Nothing's been brought out linking the death of Walter Adams with any group or organization. And I bring it to your attention again, Mr. Rainey, your line of questioning is out of order. What people say or think, that won't hold. Taking it for granted is no good. Gossip, hearsay, talk. We don't want it. This is a coroner's inquest, Mr. Rainey. A legal proceeding. And we're only interested in the legal evidence. You got that evidence, we'll hear it. Marsha Mitchell, would you take the stand, please? Miss Mitchell, we've already offered evidence that you arrived in Rock Point by bus last night, just about three minutes before Walter Adams was dragged out of jail and shot. Will you tell these gentleman in your own words what happened? I got off the bus and I walked across the street to get a cab and there wasn't any driver. Speak up, miss. Speak up. So I started to walk up the street and... And... Suddenly there was a sound of people fighting. And a man... I heard a man cry out. And then there was a shot, and then another shot. Yes, yes, go on. And then I got scared and ran. That's all I know. - That's all I can tell you. - But you saw them running away. I... I heard them, I didn't see them. But you told me in my office that you saw them. No, you misunderstood me. You said they were wearing hoods, Klan robes. Well, it was dark and there were no streetlights. - I couldn't see what they were wearing. - You were close enough. She told you everything she knows. Stop trying to put words in her mouth. You were close enough to see them, all right. It was dark and there were no streetlights. You're lying. You know you are lying. lve told you everything. Everything I saw and heard. This is no third degree. What are you trying to pull? How do you like them apples? Come, come, boys. Let's have it. Stand up. Up, up. All right, Chuck, read it out. The verdict of this jury is that Walter Adams was killed by assailant or assailants unknown. The verdict says "Assailant or assailants unknown!" The verdict was "Assailant or assailants unknown!" The verdict was "Assailant or assailants unknown!" Thank you, that was wonderful! Marsha. I told you, didn't I? Get that rope. There's another way out. Go down the stairs. Well, I was out in front for a while. And then, bang, there I was flat on my can. Walters, the Huckleheimer. Which is the way out, please? - This way. - Right through that door. The same door they dragged Adams through when they yanked him out of that cell last night. Oh, don't let it worry you. You didn't see anything. You didn't hear anything. So you didn't say anything. It didn't happen. - lm sorry, I... - Of course, you're sorry. But you couldn't help it. After all Adams is dead, the case is closed. Why get yourself involved? Hear that yelling out there? That's the Klan. They've just found out that law and order can't touch them. You did that when you let them off the hook. They're running wild. They're gonna rip up the old laws and make new ones. They're gonna do every rotten thing they can think of doing. Burt, don't get yourself in an uproar. Yeah, you're right. What am I talking to her for? Her sister's married to Hank Rice. Hank Rice works for Charlie Barr, and she's human just like everyone else. Now, you're gonna remember this day for an awfully long time. Now, beat it. "The verdict of this jury, "Walter Adams killed by assailant or assailants unknown." Come on! Drink up, everybody. Look. lm gonna pay for it myself right here. Come on! lll do it straight. They're getting wild, Lucy. - Why can't you talk to Hank? After all... - He won't hurt anything, Mr. Athens. They're just having a little fun. That stuff they're drinking, who's gonna pay for it? - lf they break something... - Well, you're the only one who can stop it. Why don't you send them home? "The verdict of this jury, "Walter Adams killed by assailant or assailants unknown." Marsha. Where have you been? We've been looking all over for you. I went to the house and didn't have a key, so I couldn't get in. Give me the key. lm gonna pack my things and catch that bus and get out of here. Well, we just want you to know that we're so grateful. Now, don't thank me for what lve done. I feel dirty enough as it is. Marsha, please don't talk like that. Whatever you did was for me and for Hank. Not for Hank. What are you working at a joint like this for? And why are you working anyway? Go get the key, baby. Go on, get the key. What's the matter, Mr. Hauser? Look. What's the matter? Didn't you like what the jury said? The man asked you something, Mr. Hauser. - You didn't like it? - lm not proud of what I did. I think it was all a disgrace. My part included. Now, I think maybe you got a point there, Mr. Hauser. Yeah, I was just saying to myself, I says, "Now, somebody is getting away with something," I said. Yeah! And that's terrible. - That's a disgrace. - Leave him alone! Let go of me! - Let go of me! - Don't hurt me, duchess, I bruise easy. - Let go, I said! Let go! - Go ahead, I like it. Let go of me. Boys, you know who this is? Its my sister-in-law. This here's a lady... Hank! Stop being a show-off. Oh, it's all right, hon. Its a compliment. That's her business. She's a model. Besides, she came butting into it. We were just having some fun with this little jerk here. - Don't be a big bully. - Oh, what's the matter? - A few laughs never hurt nobody, queenie. - It isn't funny. A bunch of hoodlums ganging up on one man. That seems to be the favorite sport in this town. - Oh, where do you get that stuff? - Hank. Get through with it. Let Mr. Hauser go. Well, who's stopping him? Come on, you guys, get out of the way there! - Thank you, miss. - Open up! Come on, what's the matter? Don't you know nothing? Come on, let him through! The boys are just having a little harmless fun, Miss Mitchell. Is this what you call harmless? You got us wrong. We're not as bad as people say. No, you're worse. Give me the key, Lucy. Like I said, the Klan does a lot of good around here. lve seen what the Klan does. Marsha. Don't rock the boat. What are you telling me that for, Mr. Barr? You know I wouldn't want to do nothing. So long as she's in town, we're not safe. Don't set her off. - What would I do? - So long as you get it straight. Well, you know I wouldn't want to start nothing. You want us to pick you up for the meeting? No, no. Frank and a couple of guys will come by after me. Hey, give me another shot of that there wide-eye, huh? Hey, don't kill it. Dead soldier. Just like Adams, dead. "Assailant or assailants unknown." I thought you were downtown. What are you doing here? I live here. This here is my home. Man's got a right to come home, ain't he? Look, lm trying to get packed and get dressed, do you mind? Go on. Go right ahead. Don't mind me. lve seen girls before. I bet you sure do look good in a bathing suit. Would you... Would you hand me my jacket, please? You know, they say that a girl's figure's her fortune. You sure got your money invested in the right places. Let's get something straight. Itll save us both a lot of trouble in case we should ever run into each other again, which I promise you, I shall try to avoid. I think you're a stupid, vicious ape. Now, get out of my way. You hadn't ought to talk to me like that. You know? You hadn't ought to. Just so you know, if you hadn't been married to my sister ld have turned you over to the police so fast that it'd have curled your hair. And the fact that I haven't doesn't mean that lm growing fond of you. So we can both stop being polite to each other right now. Why don't you like me? lm not a bad guy. I made a mistake, but I ain't never done nothing to you. Makes a guy kind of sore. lm just trying to be friendly and you turn around and act like... Why don't you ever look at me when lm talking to you? You act like lm not even here. lm just trying to be friendly. A guy ought to be friendly with his wife's sister. You ought to be nice to me, specially when I like you so much. Its sure nice perfume you got on. Its pretty. Just like everything about you is pretty. Style, that's what you got. I could tell that the minute I seen you. Even the way you walk. Everything. How come you never got married? I was afraid of getting stuck with a... - Guy like you. - You wouldn't mind that. You know, they say that what one sister goes for, the other goes for, too. Is that right? - Let go of me! - Its all right. - Let go of me! - Lucy thinks lm great. Don't worry. There's nothing to worry about. What Lucy don't know won't hurt her. - You make me sick to my stomach. - Don't give me that stuff. Girl like you, you've been around. You know what it's all about. - You're hurting me! - Some women like to be hurt. Help me! Let me out! Hank! Hank! Lucy, wait, you don't understand. It was your sister. She was making passes at me! You're a liar! Lucy! Lucy. Lucy, baby. - You're rotten! You're no good! - What did he do to you? - Oh, Marsha, I should've listened to you. - Darling, darling. - Now, look... - You no-good, filthy thing! Stop making a big thing out of this. You ain't hurt. Besides it's just an accident. Now, come on, get up. - Let her alone! - Oh, you butt out of this. I said, let her alone! She's through with you! At last she found out what you really are you dirty... Marsha, I want to go with you. - Of course, baby. - I want to get my things. - Now, wait a minute. - lm gonna get my things. - Lucy, honey. - Let go of me! You mind your own business. You'll get your face busted in! - You've done enough already. Lucy. - Let go of me! - lm through with you! - Lucy. You've done this. You've been trying to bust us up ever since you got here. You're looking for trouble. What else have I had since I got into this town, and why? Because of you, you stupid! You're so stupid, you don't know what you've just done. Lucy's leaving you and that lets me out. Why do you think lve been protecting you all this time? Covering up for you, lying for you. Why do you think I went on the stand this afternoon, and said what I said to Rainey? Because I like you? I am protecting my sister! You're getting out of town, there's a bus leaving in 20 minutes. - You're gonna be on it. - lm not leaving town. Not now. lm gonna make sure that you never bother Lucy ever again. - You're asking for it. - lm not afraid of you. I never was. I was just mixed up. I didn't know what I was getting into when I ran away. When I saw Adams get killed. - Then I found out you were involved... - Shut up. ...and I kept quiet. I even lied about it. - Shut up! But not anymore! lm through lying for you, you stupid... - You ain't gonna tell Rainey! - lm gonna identify you, the Klan... You ain't gonna tell Rainey. You ain't gonna get me hung! - You ain't gonna get me hung! - Hank, are you crazy? - Let go! - Get out of here! She was gonna go to Rainey. Get ahold of her. I don't want to get mixed up in anything like this. We'll take her right over there to the meeting, give her to Charlie Barr. Put her in there. Get in that car! Get her in there. Get in the car. What's the matter with you? You gotta learn to keep your mouth shut the hard way, don't you? All decrees, edicts, rulings and instructions of the imperial wizard of the Klan. All decrees, edicts rulings and instructions of the imperial wizard of the Klan. I will yield... You think we don't amount to nothing, huh? Well, you just look around you and see what you're up against. ...our response to all summoned. - Providence alone preventing... - Providence alone preventing... ...or may I die. ...or may I die. Take over. Stand in your places! You will all stand in your places and observe the proceedings. Let go of her. What do you mean, bringing her here? - Well, I didn't know what to do, Mr. Barr. - Keep your voice down. Well, I had to do something, because she was gonna go to Rainey. A little while ago she was on her way out of town. What happened? You couldn't leave well enough alone, could you? Keep him away from me. Now, maybe you'll be sensible. We don't want to hurt you, but you're not going to tell Rainey. You know there are ways of doing everything. Don't force us to show you how we handle people. We're the law here. We're the judges and the jury. lm no hero. lm scared. That's what you wanted and that's the way it is. Yeah, lm afraid of what you might do to me. But if I ever get out of here, lm gonna tell. And there is nothing you can do that'll stop me. You men will now rise and step back to the guard. This woman is to be punished. She has defied the power and majesty of the Klan. She must be taught a lesson, unless she relents. For the last time, will you obey the Klan? Busybodies, troublemakers, outsiders... No! ... this is what happens if you oppose the Klan. Get her out of sight. Stay here. Some of these jokers have guns, too. You don't know what they're like up there, Burt. - You better take... - Keep your eyes open and keep me covered. Maybe we can do this without trouble. - Go back, Rainey, go back. - Hi, Ed. How are things at the dairy? Hello, Mr. Rainey. She ought to be home in bed. Hello, Charlie. Get out of here, Rainey. lm warning you. Where is she, Charlie? lm taking her with me. Ain't you ever gonna get some sense in your head? You're through in Rock Point. Get out, Rainey, before you get your head knocked off. Just wearing that hood doesn't change your voice, Walker. Am I supposed to be afraid of you because your face is covered up? Itll take more than these sheets you're wearing to hide the fact that you are mean, frightened little people, or you wouldn't be here, desecrating the cross. - in the name of the imperial Klan... - Don't give me that Halloween routine. As long as lm in office, lm going to enforce the law. And in my book, you're all guilty of kidnapping. I want Marsha Mitchell. Its too late, Rainey. The inquest is closed, finished, shut up tight. We'll open it. Oh, no. Marsha, what did they do to you? Burt. Burt. - What did they do to you? - Take care of him. Now, wait a minute. You can't pin all this on me. - She says you want to tell me something. - Don't say anything. Don't you worry about me. I saw who murdered Adams. I saw the faces of two men. - They had their hoods off. - It was her brother-in-law. - You lied to me, you dirty bunch of... - Hank! Wait. Don't lose your nerve! All we got to do is stick together. Come back! Come back! Come back! Its all my fault. I could've done something about it. I should've done something about it. But you were so happy and I didn't want to spoil it for you. Lucy! Lucy! Lucy.
