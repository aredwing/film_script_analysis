Why doesn't Yang make him go instead of me? It's bullshit Because I'm expendable right? I like fures. Once, when I was young, I ate a green apple was sour, Especially yellow pajamas. Whqf? Exactly, talk lo me. I co-head the prosthetic design team with this Sun Biao guy. Sun Biao, nutshell. Mr. By-the-Book. In fact the only reason why he got promoted 10 co-head is because of his family connections. Mun, if he finds out... What are you doing? It's all on the details. Go on. So our team designed this advanced prosthetic special computer chip. H's Cl breakfhrough in our business. And it's the star product the company wants to roll out, as soon as we go public. Problem is, last month I discovered a major glitch in the chipsef. Ifs not a huge problem... What's the glitch'? Whui kind of glitch? It's technical you wouldn't get it ... Whclf glitch? Basically, the error causes the artificial leg to... lock up... and snap. H's not funny. Sorry, go ahead. Lifile more time to figure ii out. That's so wrong, you're going to hell. If's not funny. Sorry, I don't know why I'm laughing, I'm sorry. So I iold my supervisor Yang about ii. And she told me to keep my mouth shut, especially to Sun Biao. Well, this could be serious especially with the company so close to going public. Yeah as luck would have if, ihe securities commission requested u special hearing to learn more about the product. She asked you to testify as the expert. Nof just ihai... They wcani me to lie of the hearing. Tell a lifile lie, company stays in business, management makes millions of dollars. You might even get some big cuss bonus. Tell the irufh... Everything everyone's worked for, for years, goes right down the toilet. And I'll probably be ouf of u job and out on the street high demand... Don't worry. While you've been talking, I've been formulating a plan. Whui plan? A donut? It's cl tire, you idiot. That's your brilliant plan? Don't worry, paper's gonna teach you some new tricks. Your fish is dead. Kept me company for 4 years. Couple months ago. Remind me never to keep you company.

Are you saying what I'm thinking? I'm destined to do more in life. Congratulations! You've found your calling. Now the three phases are complete. Open up. I don't have the key. Sec!

And ihen you're just u guy trying to put food on the table. What does your wife say? You haven? Fold her? I don't wanf her 1'0 worry about ii. Money is fight enough as ii is. How much money do you have on you right now? Why? We can still do this. You pay, I'll pick. We'll split halves if ii works. This is so stupid, man. We're lucky Pang's not home. This is if.

She was 4 months pregnant... What does this have to do with... No man. Why do you bofile all this shit up? This supports my diagnosis. This is going to be difficult for you to accept. There is u rare form of menial illness known as "brief psychotic disorder". Simply put, it's a short-term illness with psychotic symptoms. If usually occurs offer, or in response to, severe trauma, such as assault, loved ones, catastrophic events, or major stress in life. Symptoms usually appear suddenly, often in the form of hallucinations. Whcli do you mean? Are you saying I'm CFCIZY? Yes, but not entirely. You gonna listen 10 this quack-off? Where'd you buy your license from? Brief psychotic disorder, BPD usually lasts no more than a few monfhs. I will give you some meds, if should help deal with the hallucinations. Bullshit. Way to push the drugs, right? Don't listen 10 this guy, do not believe him Li I appreciate ii, but will you just go ouf and have a smoke or something? Doctor, are you sure about this? Maybe, maybe ii was something I ate. I'm quite certain. Often, BPD symptoms include disorieniafion or confusion, delusions of grandeur, and seeing and hearing things that aren't there. Are you saying I've been imagining everything lately? Of course not. Everything you did was real. The places you went all exist. You need to deal with this illness, before if gets dangerous. Here. Look of this. I storied recording earlier... Are you saying I'm CIGZY? Yes, but no!' entirely. I appreciate if, but will you just go out and have a smoke or something? So what's up, you crazy or what? Seems like if. Really. You're not gonna get a second opinion? No need. So what now. Of course I didn't win the jackpot. So what's if this time? I haven't been feeling well. Wasn't that last week's excuse? Let's not ploy this game, okay? I've let your recent absences slide, but don't think you can'? Be replaced. What's with ihe bed head? Comb your damn hair. Boss wants 10 see you. If we fake care of this problem the company won't forget you. Now, when we meet with Mr. Wang, don'f mention ihe defective chip... He doesn't wont to hear about if. He just wclnis Cl chat with you. Okay, sweetie? It's a procedural matter. At the hearing, just do what you're supposed to do. Be sure and do your homework. Don'? Screw if up. Don't worry Mr. Wang, I've made if very clear to Li. I'm sure he won't let us down. Done with the old guy, let's go. We goi crime fighting io do! From whc I've heard, your recent performance hasn't been up to par. Shape up and focus. That's if for now. Finally! I thought the old geezer would never shut up. Sir, would if be possible for me to work from home? I'll be able lo concentrate beer, and less risk of others geing involved. What do you think? Now you're fcllking. Yang? Perhaps for The iime being... There'll be fewer distractions. I'll be calling io check in. Come on, what do you... Hey Li, is there something wrong with the door? Meeting? Hi, this is Li Yue. Li, Pcmg's husband... I can't reach her cell. What case? Ok, no ifs fine, never mind. Where are you? Look. If we're going to be together, there needs to be some changes. You're not mud at me anymore? No man. If wasn't you, if was me. What kind of changes? First of all... You can't keep coming around when I am with my wife. In fuci, don't folk 10 me when I'm with other people if makes me look crazy okay? Just do me this favor? Are you saying we didn't have u good time, the three of us, on Operation Donut? Shit! See that's what I mean. Pclng must think I'm a freak for Talking to myself... And in English! What? No. Not 10 mention, seemingly introducing her to that jerk neighbor. Since obviously you weren't really there. Just, follow the new rule. Fine. Good. Done. Great. Gk. Come here. I've missed you buddy. If was more fun hanging with you anyway. You haven't told Pang about our extra-curricular activities have you? No, she wouldn't understand. She's changed. Back in the day she probably would have thought this idea first. Kid won't solve. After the baby... ifs just mood swings with her now. Where'd you get all this footage from? Whenever she does cm undercover reporting, she has to secretly tape her interviews to keep as evidence. She's got more balls than you do. Yeah, worries fhe hell ouf of me. She loves her work. The key is to capture every detail of the illegal activity on camera, otherwise the station can't broadcast the story. So what case are you looking for? The roof of my marital troubles. I know it's here somewhere... Our first mission. What took you so long? His secretary's got cl friggin' big bladder. Let's do if. We don't keep cash of the office. Take my wullei. We don't want your money. We have other plans for you. Take off your clothes! Keep crawling until you're ready to talk, diaper mun. Who are you? Why are you doing this? Yes. Think. Why?

Where do you think you are going? Answer the question! Whuf question, you fucking psycho! You think you gonna gei away with this? You know who I um! I'm gonna hunt you down and chop you up and serve you like cl Mongolian beef. Do not threaten me, you bastard! Maybe this will help you remember. Drink if. Drink if! Now why would you spit out your own product? You worried about mqlnuiriiion 10o? So this is what this is all about. That's bullshit. Folic acid. Essential lo nourishment and growth of the baby during pregnancy. Hey, isn't that your assembly line? Let's see what they're doing shall we? When do you puf in the folic acid? We don't. These are all the ingredients. What are these? Sugar and corn powder. That's odd. Folic acid supplement without any folic acid in it. How does this get past regulators? That's not my business. You don't have any proof, you freak. That's one of the things that can happen to a fetus when ifs mother fakes your fake vitamins. Like I said, you hove no proof. This was my baby boy. After the miscarriage, doctors did extensive tests. And concluded that my wife did not have enough folic acid in her body. Investigations were made and of least 3 oiher similar cases were found with women who also took your product. Whclf do you want from me? Why do you pick on me? Just because I run this joint-venture you ihink I'm can easy shake-down? You befier go and lalk to my Chinese colleagues, they're... I could cure less where your company is. You're in charge here, so I hold you responsible. Did you really fhink you guys can get away with it in the end? I want you to tell me to my face... Tell me you did this just so you greedy pricks could make a few extra bucks. Admif if! How do I know you won'i shoot me either way? That depends on whether I think you're telling the truth or not. That's not a real gun. You really want to find out? No no, alright! Siop! We le oui the folic acid. But we never puf in any harmful ingredients. How did you get post The government regulators? We switched if out q few months ufier ii was initially approved. Okay? You happy now? Say goodbye. Whoi? You said you wouldn't... Sucks when you been lied 10. Think we went overboard with your diaper idea? No, if was great. Out. Do not threaten me, you bastard! Awesome. Chief. Remember that folic acid case Pang was investigating? What about if? We didn't touch anything. As soon as we saw him we contacted you. The guy locked me in the bathroom! Find that son-of-q-bifch! It's the chief. Maternity products. His name was Richard. You transferred me f0 another case remember? Really? That. Undercover reporting and anonymous tipster prompt arrests. There's nothing about us. As long as if gets the job done. Our iape can't be submied as evidence, but if prompted the cops who? 10 look for. For u few bucks you can stop aging and ovoid cancer... Dear old people. Do not fall for this scum. If if were a miracle drug as they claim, it wouldn't be sold on the streets by sketchy guys. Please leave a message after fhe beep. Hello. Are you home? Your phone's always off...
