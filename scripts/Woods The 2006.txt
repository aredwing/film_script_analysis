Don't you think? Mind the paint, dear. - Hello. - Heather? We didn't see you there. I'm sorry. I'm Miss Traverse, headmistress. Welcome to the Academy. Heather is so excited to be here. This is much nicer than the boarding school I went to. We're rather isolated here... ...so we try and supply the students with plenty of stimulation. Academic and otherwise. Do you like athletics, Heather? You look as though you might. Oh, Heather needs to concentrate on her studies... ...before she can worry about playing games. This way, please. It's been over a century since the Academy... ...was originally founded as a one-room schoolhouse. We've grown quite nicely since then. In fact, all of the teachers were once students at the school. Miss Leland, this is Dr. and Mrs. Fasulo. You must be Heather. Heather, would you like to join me? We like to have a short interview with each new student as she arrives. Just so we know what sort of young lady we're dealing with. Miss Leland will sit down with you to discuss tuition. Follow me, Heather. So you enjoy setting fires. According to my papers, the whole house almost went up... ...as a result of some sort of disagreement with your mother. This is not a school for wayward girls, Heather. This is not a juvenile hall. We have a great tradition of graduating only the finest young ladies. So no fires? Your mother has inquired about financial aid. Apparently, your father is not as well off as he presents himself. We do offer scholarships for students we consider particularly gifted. Has anyone ever thought you might be? Complete this within the time limit, and we'll go from there. So how did we do? Don't let your nails get out of control. Miss Mackinaw? Take care of this young lady, won't you? Are you hungry? You must drink your milk, girls. Where's Ann Whales been? You didn't hear? It was really bloody. You'll have to pull your socks up. Otherwise, it's a uniform demerit. And then what? A spanking? I'm Marcy Turner. Heather. You take the scholarship test? Apparently, my father isn't as well off as he presents himself. Who is? Hi, Marcy. How are you? - I'm well. - Wow, that's super. Have you all met Heather? Hi there. So you're Marcy's new friend? Sure. That's super keen. Hey... Samantha. - Samantha. - Yes, Heather? Do me a favor: Point those torpedoes south and start walking. I'm trying to eat. A bad girl. Hey, is your pubic hair red, too? Guess there's only one way to find out: Marcy, does Heather have red pubes? Is she a fire-crotch? I'm kidding. Friends? Oops. Sorry about that. - Good night, ladies. - Good night, Miss Mackinaw. Good night, Miss Mackinaw. Good night, Miss Mackinaw. Good night, everyone. Good night, Mary. Good night, Lena. Heather. Free us. Release us. This is my bed. It's a nice bed. Someone else will have to sleep here. Why are there twigs in my hair? What? - Hey, wait up. - Okay, well hurry up... ...we can't be late again. - All right. Hey, whose bed is that? Ann Whales. She's in the hospital now. She had an accident. What happened? Tried to kill herself in chemistry class. Couple weeks ago. There was blood all over the place. Let's go, ladies. Have a good day. Say it. Say it. "I'm a fire-crotch." - What? - "I am a fire-crotch." How many football players put it in you... ...before your mom got sick of having another tramp around the house? Nice one. If you know what's good for you, you'll run away and never, ever come back. Got it, fire-crotch? Miss Fasulo, you are 20 minutes late. Sorry. You are disrupting the other students' ability to learn. - Sorry. - More than three minutes tardy... ...equals a truancy. Go to Miss Traverse's office and inform her of your infraction. - Come on. - Don't you dare talk back to me! You get out of my sight! Get out of my class immediately! And that's a demerit for your un-tucked blouse. Do not go to the headmistress' office without tucking in your... Don't tuck it in here! What kind of a low-class so-and-so reaches her hands into... Go to the ladies' room, and then go to Miss Traverse's office. I was hoping you'd be here more than a few days before being sent to see me. I'm disappointed, Heather. You know, you're right. I'm just not up to the standards of this fine institution. Better let me call my parents. Tell them to come get me. Here. - Yes? - Mom? Heather, I wasn't expecting to hear from you. It's just wonderful about the scholarship, dear. I told all the other ladies. No, Mom. I... I faked it. It was... Look, can I just talk to Dad? Your father is entertaining company, dear. - Listen to me... - Mrs. Richards... ... will you mind the carpet. It's brand new. I'm sorry that I got into trouble all the time. Oh, hi, Dorothy. And that I fought with you. - And the fire. - I had to pull a lot of strings... ...to get you into that school. - Mom, I... ...I promise that I won't embarrass you anymore, okay? You think I sent you... Heather, I am your mother. Oh, for heaven's sake. I have to go. Mrs. Richards just spilled that drink. Mom, I just wanna come home. I miss my friends. Heather, sweetheart... ... you don't have any friends. Now, you listen to me: You stop being such a weakling... ... and you work hard and you make me proud. I'll excuse the truancy. You may return to class. You shouldn't go into the woods. It's not safe. It's not so bad here. Better than living at home. Home would be fine if my mom was dead. You shouldn't say things like that. Here. We can listen together... ...if you want. You first heard her at the ripe age of 17... ... with her number-one hit "It's My Party," here's Lesley Gore. - Marcy. - Jeez. - Marcy looked like she was gonna cry. - Sorry. - Come on, Samantha. We're ready. - Ready? - Here! - Barbecue, it's you! - Come on, Heather. - Shut up, Jen. It's okay, Heather. - Come on, Heather. Heather. - Come on, Heather, get the ball, Heather. Quit standing around and bring back the ball. - What are you doing? - Bring the ball! Set us free. Help us. Has anyone heard what's happened to Ann Whales? I haven't heard anything. Is she still in the hospital? You know, Marcy, you could be sitting on a dead girl's bed. Ann's not dead. - Well, how do you know, Marcy? - She probably killed her. - Yeah, and you're next. - Shut up, fire-crotch. Can we get back to the photosynthesis? - Maybe it was Clara Thompson. - Oh, God. - Who's this? - A stupid story they tell all the freshmen. Don't go into the woods at night or blah, blah, blah. The story goes all the way back to the old days. - Tracy peed her pants when she heard it. - Oh, shut up. Clara Thompson and her sisters were these three witches... ...that took over this school almost 100 years ago. They just walked out of the woods one day. No one knew where they came from. I heard they were orphans. I thought they just kind of came out of nowhere. Anyways, after they arrived at the school... ...strange things started to happen. - We love you. The sisters were just creepy. They were always looking off to the trees. Hearing voices that no one else could hear. One day, the students caught them practicing a weird ritual. - Right inside the school. - Witch. They were terrified by what they saw. They taunted the sisters. They beat them. I mean, it got really bad. So, Clara called upon the woods for revenge. She offered them all the students' souls in return. We'll do anything! A couple of days later, the girls chased the sisters into the forest. Out for blood. But when they all got out there, something happened. Something bad. - What? - No one knows. Accept these gifts... ... and let the primal song free your restless souls. But what we do know, is that later that night... ... all the other girls came out of the woods, led by Clara. Like she had them under a spell. Like they were possessed. And they all watched as Clara chopped up the headmistress... ...with an axe. I am so proud of you, Clara. Yeah, and then all the other girls joined in... ...and they stabbed her and smashed her head in with logs. And when she was in this big, mushy pile... ...of guts and bones and blood... ...they dumped it all down the well. The very same one out in the rec yard. And what I hear... ...is that Clara still roams the woods at night... ...waiting for little girls to wander too far out. Waiting for fresh blood. Yeah, real mature, Jen. What do you think, Heather? I heard you took a walk in the woods not long ago. You see any Clara Thompsons out there? You ever been out there, Barb? Quit it, we haven't started yet. Quit it! I'm going. Maybe this isn't such a good idea. - Go. - I am! This is so s... Trust us. How are you today? - I don't have my pencils and stuff. - You won't need them. This is the first of your advanced courses. It's a condition of your scholarship... ...to participate in this class whenever told. Heather... ...how did you come to attend this school? Well, I got into the car and then my dad started the engine... I won't ask again. A woman came to my school during conferences this summer... ...and convinced my mother that this is where I should be going. - And? - And... ...my mom wanted me out of the house. Do you resent your mother for leaving you here? Sure. You hate her? - No. - Does she hate you? A loving mother never abandons her child. To be separated from her is like an amputation. It doesn't matter what a child looks like, if she's smart, if she's stupid... ...if she has no friends. So why would your mother leave you here? That is none of your business. She's afraid of you. - Stop! - Why is she afraid of you? Kill her. Are you a bad person? Do you think bad thoughts? - Stop! - Is it the voices? Pain. - I don't... - Destiny. I don't... What do they say? Heather. Heather, do you hear? Kill your mother. Teacher. Death. Serve us. We love you. Kill her. - What the hell was that? - Watch your language. If I frightened you... ...I apologize. How did you do in there? Are you special enough for a scholarship? Everyone knows you're a fake. You're not an egghead like Marcy and Ann. You're dumber than a fucking tree stump. I believe you're gonna cry, fire-crotch. Heard you scream all the way down the hall. Traverse give you a hard time in there? Seriously. You look like you've seen a ghost. Or heard one. Not so tough anymore, are we? Samantha. All right, ladies. The Austrian War of Liberation. Today's lesson. In April 1809, Austria proclaimed war of liberation on France. France responded by rapidly advancing... Which, if you remember, we occupied... The Germans... Balance. Drink your milk. What is it? You'd think her parents would take her home. Can't. They died. Marcy... ...have you heard... ...or seen strange things happen at this school? Like what? Heard you been saying stuff behind my back, fire-crotch. Now, Samantha, all I said was your breath smells like... ...you've been drinking out of Miss Mackinaw's douche bag, that's all. I don't wanna kiss you, Samantha, so please, don't ask. Now, you listen very closely, fire-crotch: We have a certain way of doing things around here... ...and you better figure out what that way is... ...or there are going to be serious consequences. Fire-crotch! Fire-crotch! Fire-crotch! Get off me! Get away from me. Why don't you let her go? - What is this? - Miss Fasulo attacked Miss Wise... ...in the dining hall. - Is that so? - I didn't attack anyone. I was just trying to defend myself. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... Now, listen: We have a certain way of doing things around here... ...and you had better figure out what that way is... ...or there are going to be serious consequences. Get to the bunkhouse before lights out. Ann? That's your name, isn't it? I'm Heather. I know what you're here for. - You're special too. - What? Like me. Like Marcy. We have to do what they say or they'll kill everyone. I can't understand you. I am so cold. It's too late. They're here for me. What are you doing out of your bunk, young lady? Ann, what are you doing awake? You lie down right now and go to sleep. Sit down and wait for the nurse. So we had a little accident last night? Twisted your ankle? I know. What happened to you? Oh... banged up my ankle. Sorry about all the hollering last night. Last night? When? - Breakfast. Nuts, we should go. - What was that all about? What happened last night? No, later. Just go ahead, I'll catch up. Hey, Ann. It's breakfast. No doubt you have all heard that one of our family... ...Ann Whales... ...went missing sometime last night. I just wanted to reassure all of you: The authorities are searching for her as we speak. In the meantime... ...the best way to deal with this is go on with our work... ...and trust that all will be resolved in time. Dismissed. That's all that's left of Ann. Wake up, Miss Turner. It's time for your lesson. For your throat. The song must be perfect. You must do it over and over until there are no mistakes. My guidance will assure that. All right, now, Miss Turner, we're going to try it again. - And this time... - Please, I've been doing this all day... It is tremendously important that we do this. - I am trying. I can't do it... - I wouldn't want to have to... You put your makeup on upside down, silly. Your girlfriend's got a real pretty voice, fire-crotch. Back off. We need to have a little discussion. Try it again! The folks at the hospital gave me this. I guess Ann must have forgot it after her accident. Ann will appreciate this. I'll give it to her this evening. How is she? Quiet, but we're keeping an eye on her. I don't suspect she'll try anything rash again. Good. Well, thanks for signing this stuff. I'll be sure to get it to Ann's insurance company this week. It's no problem at all. Okay. Marcy, listen to me: I just saw a cop talking to Miss Traverse. And she didn't tell them anything about Ann. She totally lied. I had a really tough session today. My throat's sore. Hey. Marcy. There's no one out there looking for Ann. Ann's fine. Everything's fine. Hey, I really need to talk to you. Leave me alone... ...fire-crotch. Don't forget to drink your milk. She's crazy. - Fire-crotch. - I hope she gets kicked out. - This girl is nothing but trouble. - I told you they were gay. She's in trouble now. She is so lucky. She better watch out. She'll get her later. Lights out. Everyone in bed. Now. Sleep. Want Marcy. Release us, Heather. I was asleep. You were asleep? Everybody was asleep? You didn't see anything, either. Breakfast. Why is everyone standing around? Good Lord. Everyone, get ready for breakfast. I'll inform Miss Traverse of what's happened. Get dressed, Miss Fasulo. Don't worry. We'll find Marcy. And Ann? In the process of metamorphosis, there are four stages. Could you tell me another word for chrysalis? - Pupa. - Correct. Marcy? - Marcy? - You're not gonna find her out there. - Get away from me. Get... - Shut up and just listen to me. - Get off of me. - I'm trying to help you. I have to get Marcy. I tried to warn you about Marcy, but they're always watching. We've gotta get you out of here. I called your dad. I told him you went nuts. I just hope he gets here before they take you too. It's the teachers. They do tests. Give out scholarships. Clara Thompson was just the beginning. The woods possessed her. Took over the school. And there's more of them waiting to be freed. You think you're the only one that hears the voices? How do you think they found you? The woods need more bodies. They'll take every girl here, and you're the key, Heather. Just like Clara was. You're the first Miss Traverse has seen. You're psycho. Listen. Very closely. - We've got to find... - Samantha. You should be in class right now. Yes, ma'am. Come with me. I believe you're tardy for Miss Charevoix's class, Miss Fasulo. Don't drink the milk. Marcy. Right now. So Hannibal began his trek across the Alps. Who can tell me his mode of transportation? Miss Fasulo? I'll give you a hint: It wasn't horses. He needed a lot of peanuts. What was that? Come on, let's go. Hurry. Go. - Just follow her. - Oh, what's going on? - Where are we going? - I don't know. Come on. Everyone out. Come on. I'm gonna miss you. This is so horrible. - What did you say to Samantha? - Nothing. The girl is dead. What did you say? I know what you're doing. - She told me everything. - Told you what? Which story? That I kidnapped your friends..? Yes. Samantha was a good student, once. But she was very angry and very confused. But I was charged with looking after her. Obviously, I failed to do that. Where are Ann and Marcy? They ran away. It happens. You don't have to believe me. This is one of the most distinguished schools in the country. We could not very well survive, had we orchestrated the disappearance... ...of two of our best students... ...within weeks of each other. Truth be told: We may not survive this, regardless. I don't know what I'd do if I lost this school. It's been a part of me for so long. Be patient. Your friends will come back. They always do. Is there something else you wish to ask? The things that I've heard. The things that I've seen. - I'm not crazy. - I know. You're different. All the signs are there, Heather. You want me to call the parents? I should be the one to tell them. Robert, have you met Heather Fasulo? How are you? Hey, how's the search for Ann and Marcy going? I just miss them so much. Miss Fasulo is expected in chapel. Two of the students... ...did, in fact, go missing shortly after we found Samantha. - Ann was one of them. - And you weren't gonna tell me? I didn't wanna cause you any more trouble. Well, that's really not up to you, Miss Traverse. One of the students saw them run into the forest. Miss Leland will show you which direction. Ann? Marcy? Hello? "Miss Leland will show you which direction." Come on, it's beyond your curfew. Come on, girls. Lucky rabbit, lucky rabbit. Okay. Marcy? Ann? Samantha? Are you special enough for a scholarship? You take the scholarship test? We do offer scholarships for students we consider particularly gifted. Blood. Ann? Marcy? - Dr. Fasulo... - I'm sorry to waste your time. Whatever you were told, the damage was not that bad. Somebody called and said my daughter went on a rampage. I don't know who made that call. But we've been very attentive to your daughter's needs. - She just needs to settle in. - I'm sorry to waste your time. But this is all my fault. I never should have left her here in the first place. - Joe, turn around. - I can't understand it. Go back and ask for directions. It's too late. I'm positive we went out the same way we came in. - This is ridiculous. - I think I saw a road a ways back. You be quiet. We wouldn't be out here to begin with if it wasn't for you. - Alice. - I don't know what I have to do... ...to get you under control, Heather. - Then stop trying. You keep up the smart mouth, young lady. As soon as we get home, we are finding another school. A religious one. I'm talking nuns. - Oh, Alice, we're not even Catholic. - I don't care. Joe, watch where you're going! Dad! Great. This is my life. Me and my perfect family. Could we please just drop it? Maybe you're the one that needs to go back to school. You can't even find your way down a simple road. Now, you listen. I've had just about enough... Heather. Heather, are you all right? I can't understand it. The earth must have just given out. Joe, help me. Heather, sweetheart. Hang in there. - What? - Hang in there? You be quiet. Alice? Alice? - Does that hurt? - Yes. She actually sustained that before the accident. I'll go see about some crutches. The doctor thinks you have a mild concussion, Heather. No big deal. Where's my parents? Why don't I go tell Miss Traverse you're awake? Help me. Where's Mom? Come here, honey. Where is she? Oh, Heather. - Here she is. - Oh, you can't be in here. - No! - Just relax. Just... It'll be fine. - Hey. - Dad! No! - What are you doing? Let go of her! - Heather, it's gonna be all right. - Bring her back! - She's a witch! Stop! What are you do..? She'll kill you! What are you doing? Where are they taking her? She's in shock. - Stop. - Good girl. - Bring her back. - Heather hasn't been fully examined. She needs me and she needs to be here with me. The doctor says she may have internal injuries. We must give them a chance to do their jobs. I can't understand it. I mean, one minute... ...we're sitting there on the side of the road... ...and then the next minute the car just... Something took her. In the car, something... Bring her back here. Bring me my daughter. I wanna see my mom! Where is she? - No. No! - I really can't bring Heather back to you. - Please! - Who the hell are you? You do as I say, right... I want my mom! Where is my mom? Stop him! I wanna see my... Heather. Wake up. It's time. How are you feeling? Dad? Heather? Heather. I'm afraid his condition has worsened. But the doctors say it's only temporary. - Ceremony. - Heather. I love you. Balance the stones. All the signs are there. It's time. Our wait is over. Free us. Free us. Drink it. They moved you. You're over there. This is my bed. - Good night, ladies. - Good night, Miss Traverse. - Good night, Miss Traverse. - Good night, Miss Mackinaw. Good night, Miss Traverse. You better watch out. Something's going to happen. You better be careful. My family is large. I cannot rest until I've freed them all. What's happening? If you struggle, it will only hurt more. Where are we? You don't know what it's like to be trapped. To be tied to the same place... ... for hundreds of years. They're here to help you, Heather. Don't be sad. By leaving this world... ... you're giving others the opportunity to fully enter it. What's wrong with you? Let me go! Ever since I came here with my sisters, we have been waiting for you. Hear our prayer, Mother. Marcy, stop. Accept these gifts... ... and let the primal song free your restless souls. Balance the stones, Heather. - And there shall be an end to the pain. - No. Mom? Help me. What do you think I've been trying to do this whole time? Now, you stop being such a weakling... ...and you work hard... ...and you make your mother proud. I'm sorry. Heather! Let me in! Balance the stones, Heather. You never listen. Heather! Open this door! Heather! Somebody let me in! I'm so proud of you, Heather. Let the souls of the woods enter these young vessels... ... and finally walk the earth. - Heather! - Dad? Heather, get out! You can't escape. You can't stop the change. Help me. - Kill her. - Kill her. Kill her. So gifted. I am everywhere.
