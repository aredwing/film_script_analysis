Tensions between Bialya and Pokolistan reached new heights... ...when Bialya disregarded U. N. sanctions... ...and pushed into settlements across the border. Three strikes? This is the law, not baseball. If a man commits a felony, he should be expunged from civilized society. Victims' families are asking how such a tragedy could have taken place. Luckily, Superman arrived in time to avert the terror attack. - Military deaths in Middle East... - Polls show... ...more often afraid than not. - Where are our heroes? - Sources describe the woman as kind. ... when nations are not held accountable for their actions... Time to take your medicine, love. - Easy as pie, didn't I tell you? - I like pie. You're about to go on a diet. Superman! Blast him! - Oh, oh! Oh, oh! - Why don't you two cool off? - Caught a couple of big fish, Superman. - And without a net. Back to the tank with you two. Up, up and away. Maybe this time they'll learn that crime doesn't pay. Wow, okay. Ha-ha. That's, uh... Wow. It never occurred to me that the S stood for "silly." It wasn't that bad. When have you ever said "crime doesn't pay"? Well, you can take the kid out of the cornfield... Producer said it would be inspirational. And who's profiting from all this so-called inspiration? Proceeds from the cartoon go to charity, Lois. Yes, I've got someone watching. And yes, we have an iron-clad contract. And do you get creative input? Did I mention it all goes to charity? Point is, you have to protect your S. The world is always watching Superman. Well, not always. Oh. Smooth one, farm boy. So close. - Help me! - My God. - The Atomic Skull. - Get somewhere safe. You've gone too far this time, Skull. They were just lawyers. Come closer and we'll talk about it. You've gotten bigger. That genebomb that created me... ...it's still going off. Let go! - Cute. - Why did you attack those people? To draw out the main course, of course. - You used them for bait? - Give me a break. I do what I do, you do what you do. You'll have your front page in 15 minutes, chief. Yes, I'll spell-check. Okay, beat it. Whoa. Here we are, lads and lassie. Makes the old hometown look positively quaint. Mm. Makes me thirsty. They grow them big here, but not as big as Blue Boy. Keep your pants on, Pammy. We don't need you getting all beasty now. - Where do you think he is? - I'll find him. Just stay tight. First impressions, you know. - He don't like you. - I don't like him. So was this justice, Superman? Millions in property damage... ...helpless bystanders killed by a repeat metahuman felon... ...who's now enjoying three square meals a day as a guest of the state. You had the power to end Atomic Skull's criminal career right there permanently. Why didn't you? I'm not anyone's judge and jury, Professor Baxter. Definitely not an executioner. My powers don't put me above the law. A noble sentiment. But are you the Superman that the 21st century needs? Why not use your power to fix the world? Let me reiterate that I'm playing devil's advocate. I'm a huge fan. - Not embarrassing at all. - Your dad? Could do worse. First, I don't believe that the world is broken. Because when we say the world, we're really talking about people. And it's always been my belief that people at their core are good. - Ha. - The grace of mankind is everywhere. You just have to open your eyes. Humanity has a limitless potential for good. My purpose is to help people reach that potential. Tamarev. Tamarev is under attack. What have you people done? How dare you? Pokolistan holds to the treaty. Liar. My people are dying in the streets. No less than they deserve. Limitless potential for good? Good isn't perfect. I have to go. To be continued, professor? This is an act of war. Not while you press our borders. Reports are streaming in from Tamarev... ...capital of the Eastern Bloc nation of Bialya. We're trying to get someone on the ground, but as we've been reporting for weeks... ...diplomatic efforts between Bialya and neighboring Pokolistan have collapsed Both countries have access to considerable technology. Weapons of mass destruction could come into play. The U.N. has tried to intervene... Wait, I'm sorry, we 're getting something. Oh, God. We've heard rumors about Pokolistan's bio-weapons program. But this - One of yours? - No. Oi. You in the cape. The bastard doesn't have a brain or I'd have had him rip his own guts out already. He's still alive, so if you don't mind setting aside the kid gloves... - Come back from that. - Nice one, brother. But you could use a smidge more flair. Okay. Flair, mon frre. Who's a good sorcerer? Double pork fried rice for you tonight. You sure know how to make an entrance. Thanks for the assist. Next time, double-check for collateral damage. Came a little close there. - Hello. - You're really tall. Don't mind them, Mr. Superman, sir. Big fans. Paralytic with giddiness. So before anyone does anything embarrassing: Ta. Wait. Who are y...? Where did they come from? Where did they go? What do they want? What's all over that woman's body? These four are the biggest news since Brainiac ate Boston. Someone's gonna break this story and it better be us. It's a given that I am getting the scoop on these newbies, right? Not unless you can type Do not make me unleash my feminine wiles on you, Clark Kent. Too late. For someone who plays fair, you can really suck sometimes. "Telekinetic. Conjured a dragon out of thin air." Outstanding, Kent. - Been on the phone with your source? - Tweeting, actually, sir. Take point on this. Book a flight wherever you need to go. Take Lane if she's still talking to you. Hope you like cold showers, Smallville. You spoke to Superman? What did he say? Are these guys the real deal or what? The jury's still out, Jimmy. He said they're strong. Really strong. But there's something about them. Looks like they did a pretty good job to me. If you boys are done gossiping, some lady in England... ...just went online claiming to know all about Superman's new best friends. - Sorry there's no movie. - Don't try to be cute. You're lucky I'm letting you fly me there. Once we hit the ground, it's every reporter for herself. Unless I get something really juicy. Ah. Learning. I practically raised the lad. He played football in me garden and teased me cats, the rascal. Ha-ha. But a big heart, oh, a big heart. Always helped come harvest. What's his name, Mrs. Munsch? It's not for me to say, is it? Unless you're willing to pay for the exclusive. If she knows anything, I'm the Martian Manhunter. There go all of my fantasies. I'm gonna go knock down some doors. Call me if you get anything. - You too. - We'll see. I'll tell it all. How he saved Churchill from that nasty Doberman. With just his brain. Quite the looker. Your reporter friend. I'm not into the golden oldies. Subspace teleport pods. All the cool HQs have them. So are you stalking me or are you here for the scenery? You never gave me your cell. Had to start somewhere. Quite the detective. Following the guy... ...with the Union Jack tatted to his chest to England? Heh. Come on, I'm just breaking your boots, Superman. Truth is I ramble when I get nervous... ...and I'm in a bit of a twist having a jaw with Superman. Ha. - Let's start with your name. - Manchester Black. Aspiring do-gooder and all-around pain in the ass at your service. You wanna talk? Let's talk. Just not here. Never could stand the smell of the place. Feeding time. Hey, some parsnips and carrots. Good for the skin. - This is inhuman. - Just think what a service you're providing... ...having all your energy sucked into the city's electronic grid. It's almost like you cooked your own supper. Incoming. It's the big guy. Hello, again. Come on, you lot. He doesn't bite. That's a pity. Big fella goes by Coldcast. The Hat's our resident master of hocus-pocus... ...and fortune cookie wordsmith. Your lucky numbers are four, eight, 15... -...and... - I'm Menagerie, but you can call me Pam. At this number. Anytime. Down, girl. Good to meet you all. Thank you again for what you did in Bialya, but we need to talk. Of course. Someone comes sniffing around your tomato... ...so to speak, you need to get a look-see. Due diligence. We're an open book. So if you'll just relax... Sorry. I heard your telepathic shout before. But my mind is protected from anything deeper by a series of psychic blocks. Best I've seen too. Got a few skeletons rattling around up there you don't want out? I'm not looking for your deepest, darkest. Showing is faster than telling. I hate to hear me own voice, believe it or not. Don't believe him. Only thing shuts him up is a soccer game. Football, you uneducated Yank. This is low-level stuff, Supes. Promise. Like telly in HD. - All right. - Apologies in advance... ...for the graphic nature of what you're about to see. Some of us had it rough in the origin department. I'm off, then. See you at dinner. Lucky I give you a roof and a pillow, you worthless squib. You want something to eat? Work it out for yourself. Take the girl with you. Can't stand her mewling. It's a Cinderella story, really. I was the unplanned fifth of five boys... ...left to fend for meself after me mum died giving birth to number six. The only girl. Vera. Ooh. What's wrong, love? I lost my mum! Oh, don't fret, dear. We'll find your mum. The only good thing I had. Brothers had all gone off and wound up dead or in jail... ...where they wound up dead anyway. But Vera, she was special. Did what I could to protect her. But really, she was always taking care of me, till that summer. Plenty of loose wallets in Heaton Park. Not proud of it, but hungry is hungry. - Good day! Let's get ice cream before... - Aah! Thought it was puberty, you know. Headaches. The feeling that my body was turning against me. But it was getting worse by the week. But that day... There's one of them. I couldn't stand. Couldn't run. A damn cripple. If it wasn't for Vera... Sod off, copper. No! Vera! It was a frigging horror show. Me, on my knees. Vera screaming. And I was helpless, praying for it all to stop. Imagine my shock when it did. Goodbye, headaches. Hello, power. After that it's the usual fish tale. Her Majesty's secret service took notice, gave me a bed... ...and taught me about hurting bad people in the name of freedom. Met this lot during a particularly disenfranchising tour in Africa... ...and we decided to make a go of it freelance, like yourself. The rest is current events. Your sister, did she make it? We don't all get happy endings, Superm... Aah! Chester! - What's wrong? - Screams. Lots of screams. Smoke and electrical discharge in both tubes. Evac all trains. Not an accident. Repeat: this is an attack. They've hit us on the east end too. Both ends of the Chunnel are sealed off. This is not right. This should not be happening. Sweet heavenly father. - Captain. - Oh, thank God. We have simultaneous attacks at both openings. The trains are trapped inside, filled to capacity. Flooding has begun to... Melt the blockage to slag and drag the lorries out. No time. The superstructure has been compromised. Collapse is imminent. Can you teleport the passengers? Teleport pod's back home, mate. We're great kicking the snot out of wankers, but this... This is a test of your imagination. How strong are you? - This for real, Ches? - Real as it gets. You got the power he needs? Don't... Just don't ask. Get ready, Black. Like your mum! Hat, you're on deck. Now! Take it up! Damn, he doing it'? Not by himself, sweet thing. If you two are doing pissing about... Got him! Hat! Tell me he's got that thing trained. Not bad for a guy who just kicks the snot out of wankers. Well, I'll be damned. We did it. Looks like you guys are gonna need a name soon. Guess what we found. - Bastards! - Manchester! Who put you up to this? - Easy, Manchester. - Not chatty? Fine. Pokolistani tweaked about England's support of Bialya. You're killing them! Stop! Can't just let them get away with it, though, can we? We won't, but not like that. Why the hell not? No less than they deserve. Call this one a win and save the philosophy for the pub, then? - Definitely. - Hey, hero. Mm. So was it the trashy outfit, or should I start gluing slugs to my face? - Maybe an iguana. - It was a moment. Pam was overexcited. Pam? One team-up and she's Pam. We saved a few hundred people, Lois. What can I say? They're new and... excitable. That excitability better stay one-sided, though you don't exactly sound like a fan. Not sure I am. You're the minority. The net's on fire. - People love these guys. - They didn't see the part... ...where Black almost lobotomized the two Pokolistani terrorists. - That would have sealed it. - What do you mean? I mean some people think terrorists should get what they deserve... ...as slowly and painfully as possible. Is that what you believe? Some days, yeah. I checked with the London Mirror while you were making kissy faces with Lady Furby. They couldn't confirm any of Black's story. - What about the sister? - No birth record. No death certificate. - So he's lying? - Don't know. We need to go deeper. If he did work for the government, his files could be... Okay. Lois. Evening, morning, and afternoon to one and all... ...wherever you happen to be. Please forgive this brief but important message... ...regarding the safety of the civilized world. How are they doing this? Can you do this? This is a call-out to the shadow cabinets petty dictators and all-around tossers of the world. You're on notice. We're not bound by lines on a map or political alliances... ...or governing bodies of any kind. We are our own bosses, and we have a very simple job. There are the good guys, namely us... ...and the bad guys, namely anyone who treats anyone else like trash... ...to further their petty aims. We turn bad guys into memories. So mind your manners, lads and lasses... ...or we'll blow your house down. We're the Elite. You asked for us, world. Now you got us. At least they picked a name. Clark? Ha-ha. All right! Finally someone's got a pair! See, Dad? That's how you do it. No one's gonna pull something with the Elite watching. Everyone likes a shiny new penny, but it doesn't mean that... Lois. Get your coat. That'll give them something to gab about. Viva the Elite! Have another, you git. Meanwhile, back at our secret HQ... ...we continue our chat with the two unluckiest sods on the planet. The slobs at the other end of the Chunnel. Your mates got off easy, and you can as well. Spill your guts, so we don't have to. Pretty please. Guess it's a woman's touch, then. You like picking on those weaker than you. Defenseless. No! No! No! Keep her away from me. The metahumans designated the Elite are not anywhere... ...within the range of our scanners. Their message was downloaded through a post-dimensional channel. I think my phone has an app for that. It means they're hiding between dimensions. Impossible to track. Though we are currently processing How many of them are informational? Zero. How many of them contain the phrase: - "These guys rock"? - 2,800,000... I need something. A location. Do you think the world has moved on to a place where I can't follow? Sir, a spatial disruption matching the Elite's energy signature... ...has been detected over Bialya. Which one of you tin cans is gonna get me back to England? Thank God for the Elite! Finally someone with the power to say what we're all thinking. Not all of us "Might makes right" has never been a productive philosophy. So instead, you'd rather have tea with terrorists. Demitasse with dictators. Of course not, but set aside the rhetoric and analyze what Mr. Black said. He said he's gonna kick some ass! Without the rule of international law, diplomacy, dialogue. Dialogue? There are people you cannot talk to. That's who the Elite are for. What happens when the Elite turn their attentions away from those people... - ...and turn them towards you? - Why the hell would they do that? I'm American! We're the good guys. American scum! Today you die. And Bialya falls. Wait. What? They have microwave popcorn in your terror-ass country? Goodnight, ladies. You got terrorist on you. Ck. No worries, mate. It's all over now. Chill a minute. We've had you on a solar energy drip, but your brain's still a wreck. My bad. Didn't see you flying in. Neutrino pulse. It's like an EMP for organics. Stops the electrons in your brain from flowing for a second. Makes everyone go nappy-time... ...unless you are in armor, apparently. Considering the hit you took, it's a bloody miracle you stayed conscious. You... No need to thank us, though cash would be grand. Kidding. How about the tour? It's less boring when you're half in the bag. Even with his ass kicked, it's still a fine ass. Remember who kicked it, baby. Totally flash, eh? She's not just a ship. She's actually the biggest silicone-based bacteria colony in the universe. Well, this universe. Sounds gross, I know, but she's fast as crap through a goose... ...and ducks between dimensions. Complete privacy and gives traffic the finger. Named her Bunny. We think she had the capacity to feel... ...so we jettisoned her emotion nodules a few ticks back. Seemed the humane thing to do. You killed them! Murdered the Pokolistani soldiers. No offense, but someone had to do something... ...while you were playing spastic on the floor. Aww. Hat! Every time we win a battle... ...he gets knackered and pukes all over the place. This isn't a joke. You can't murder people and call yourselves heroes. Why not? Your government does it all the time. Look, Supes, when we take down the baddies, they stay down. - Isn't that better for everyone? - We are not above the law. We have to show the world that there's a better way. - That people can be better. - But that's the problem. They can't. The world's overflowing with sick puppies. Original sin in 36 flavors. I'm not an idiot. I know there are bad men in power. It's not a perfect world, but we can't just throw morality in the garbage. You don't have a clue what it means to live in fear, do you? To wonder why no one can stop the bogeymen... ...who knock down skyscrapers or blow up schools. Well, we do. Human beings do. We understand fear all too well. So now we're wiping the Earth free of scum, and they love us for it. It can't be this way. You know that. I can't allow it. You're welcome for the rescue. Bunny. Black! Um... If this is a problem, I can cut you in 10 percent. As has been repeatedly stated, Ms. Lane, MI5 does not confirm nor deny... Forget it. I got the message loud and clear, Double-No Useless. Just checking in to report nothing from British Intelligence... ...which is a major oxymoron right now. You're barking up the wrong forest. As far as MI5 is concerned, there is no Manchester Black. And are you here to tell me differently, or am I about to get shot in the face? The world needs to know what they're dealing with. Vera? Ches isn't the only one who worked for the queen and had his history wiped. Hope it helps. Why? Because my brother is misguided and angry, but he saved my life. I'd like to save his, if I can. Shall we return to Metropolis, Miss Lane? Knock, knock, skullhead. Yummy time. Almost had some excitement there. The excitement's just starting. Been a lot of talk. Not much of it good. Had to put a slap on Ben Farnsworth on account of he said you looked the fool. I did, Pa. They sucker-punched you. Sucker-teleported, technically. So even Smallville's rooting for the Elite. Well, just the loud, angry and stupid. Come on, it's not that simple. I don't think that I make them feel safe anymore. The way I do things. Clark, when people are scared... ...they have a tendency to hop on a bandwagon... ...before they see who's driving it. But when they wise up, and believe me, they will... ...what matters is that you'll be there for them. Leading by example just like always. Truth, justice and the American way. It ain't broke, so don't fix it. Thanks, Pa. Besides, if those knuckleheads don't quit tugging on your cape... ...you can always kick their self-righteous asses to kingdom come. - Lois? - Home now. Let's get out of here! That's not attractive at all. Finally someone you wouldn't do. Zip it, love birds. Let's show Big Blue how it's done on his home turf. I hope you know that thing goes off during dinner. Yeah, yeah. Dad, that's Central Square. - The Elite are here. - Terrence, wait. Aren't you an ugly biter? He's sending in the B team? I want the boss, not the interns. Let him go! Black. Shield up. I really have to sober up now. What the hell is happening? I think that little rest at Stryker's did me some good. Hat, form a perimeter. Coldcast, can you absorb energy or just project it? Hells yes. If I can get that sucker before he gets me. Oi. You can't boss my team. The man giveth and the man taketh away. You're buggered, mate. Give my regards to Satan then. No. He's going back to Stryker's. Back to jail? Are you daft? This is what happens. More pain, more suffering. - We are not the law. We do not... - Kill him. - Kill him. - I'm sorry. - Do it, Manchester. - Kill it. - Kill it. - Kill it. - Kill it. - Do it. Stop, listen to Superman. - Do it. - Kill the bastard. He... He wouldn't want... It's your fault. You beat him already. - You did it your way and... - And he failed. Is that the world you want? Or should monsters like this get what they deserve? Say it, kid. No. Do it. Listen, I like Superman, sure. But the Elite will kill these murderers and terrorists. What's not to like? The Elite are terrorists. They have allied themselves with Bialya. And perpetrated acts of war against our nation. This will not be tolerated. I've lived in Metropolis my entire life. Superman has always been there for us. But so have those criminals he's put away so many times. Maybe his way doesn't work. Acts of aggression will no longer be tolerated. And not a Superman nor a Manchester Black... ...will stop us from defending our borders. Kill them all and let God sort it out. Superman's done. This is the age of the Elite. It's not fair. Someone else be Superman. Not it. - But you wanted to be Superman. Yeah, but I can't kill you, but you can kill me? That's not fair. - It's the rules. - Sucks. Superman is so beat. Clark. Clark. I called Kansas and Ma said you're not there. So pick up your stupid hologram thing or I'll kick your butt when you get home. - Sweet-talker. - Yeah, well, not really. I made it through those files on the Elite. Mr. Black's back-story is a load of rubbish. Failing to mention his sister is still alive is a good example. And that dear old Dad suffered a massive stroke... ...when Chester decided he was due for one. And how Vera's rescue resulted in the deaths of a dozen people... ...when he crushed the train that hit her. My God, are you running this in the Planet? I tried. Perry was shut down by British Intelligence before the story left his computer. No one wants to admit they took a narcissistic angry teenager... ...and tried to make a Superman out of him. The rest of the team isn't much better. No murders, but criminal records a mile long. All wiped clean when they were recruited. Vera's a sweet kid... ...but she turned into quite the establishment bitch, didn't she? Sorry to barge in, but there was no bell. And magic trumps a giant key every time. I'm going to say this once. Surrender now, face judgment for your crimes or... Stop. There is no "or" in this conversation. Because you don't have the stones to do to us what we'd do to you in a heartbeat. He might have the stones to do me. Pam, I'm handing out ultimatums. Please, keep it in your pants. You probably won't believe this, but I used to love superheroes. But masks are for hiding. Capes are for play. You were the first. The best. But now you're a clich and you don't fit in anymore. Mad scientists, idiots in underwear, bank robbers, knock yourself out with that lot. But the real work, fixing the world, is ours. Starting tomorrow with Bialya. - I'm shutting you down. - Right. Maybe this time they'll learn that crime doesn't pay. Entering Pokolistan airspace. Capital city in range. Requesting authorization for payload drop. All buildings are active targets. Level the city. Long live Bialya. It ends today. Ends without a single loss of life. Boy, you sure showed us, didn't you? Do I feel mortified? What happens next, Super Gandhi? Next I get the leaders of both Pokolistan and Bialya... ...to sit down and talk in a neutral location. - Don't you think it's a bit late for that? - It's never too late for peace, Black. That's what I'm trying to make you understand. No. No, I mean, it's a bit late... ...because the leaders of Bialya and Pokolistan... - ...are dead as a bunch of dead wankers. - What? Well, you know, the opposite of alive. Dead. No one was gonna blink here, Supes. I read their minds. Got all their precious little state secrets. Bottom line is that the war of jackholes was just going to escalate... ...until this dungheap of a region was turned to glass. - No offense. - No. You didn't. The only logical thing to do was to slot the whole megillah and start over. So congratulations, children. Your leaders are all dead. Peace reigns supreme. No! Oh, no. Wait. In a week people will forget these countries ever existed. But they'll never forget the day Superman declared war on their favorite son. Write your wills, say your goodbyes. Tomorrow it's done. While the international community... ...has condemned the actions of the Elite... public polls indicate that many feel the conflict between Bialya and Pokolistan... ...has been definitively resolved. However, with Superman next on the Elite's list, the question is... Turn it off, please. - When? - Dawn, I guess. They'll like the drama of that. Why do you have to do this? Why can't you call someone else? The Elite didn't take the fight to anyone else. - They chose me. - No, you went after them. They're slaughtering people and laughing about it. Black can punch a hole through a mountain by thinking. The Hat tosses around demons like trained birds and Pam... - They have to be stopped. - I think they can beat you. I'm sorry. But they're willing to go places you won't. And they are so damn strong. I heard a child say that he wanted to be in the Elite when he grows up... ...because it would be fun to kill bad guys. Fun to kill. People have to know that there's another way. They have to see that someone believes in humanity strongly enough to... To die for them? Clark? Show yourselves. Pretty flash entrance, isn't it? Our Bunny's a keeper. Some people have no sense of theater. - I call kneecaps. - Spine. - Other. - Wait. Not here. Please. A last request. Brilliant. We'll patch the game through to interested parties. Want everyone to see it's a fair fight, yes? Crackers. Bunny, darling. Damn you, Clark. Here's a nice slice of pitch to play on. Thank Bunny for the oxygen. Not that you need it, but we mere mortals... Figure you got a speech prepped. I've tried to reason with you. I've tried to show you there's another way. I'm begging you to help me end this without further bloodshed. Stand down and be judged for your crimes. And maybe we can all get out of this in one piece. You're an inconceivable wanker. Pay attention, would-be superheroes, and glorious people of Earth. School's in session. And Professor Chester's gonna learn you how the world will work from this day on. Rule number one: he who has the power makes the rules. Obvious. Rule number two: tough love is a crock of scatters. This isn't about love People don't want babysitters in spandex to spank them when they're bad. They want surgeons to cut out the cancers that festered in us... ...and make sure they never come back. Dr. Black, at your service. Wait for it, kids. Rule number three: no more capes. As this ends quicker than any of you ever imagined, take heed. Blue Boy is the first. But if any of his costumed cronies rise up to avenge their fallen dream... you'll get worse, I promise. The dream is over. Viva reality. No witty retort? Oh, wait. You're in the middle of a seizure. Sorry, mate. I can't read your mind... ...but I sure as hell can muck about with your brain. All those capillaries, like little tubes of concrete. But still vulnerable. It's funny, isn't it? A life of truth, justice and the American, military, capitalist way. In the end, you die on the moon, wondering if your bowels will let go. And tomorrow, the world will go on like nothing happened. Dragged kicking and screaming to a better day. Ta, mate. - They didn't really... - I mean, it's Superman. There, look. How is it that no matter how badly you massacre... ...one of these thong-and-blanket types... ...some shred of their unmentionables still survives the blast? I did my best, boss. At least you got a trophy out of it. Strewth. Right, who else has business to perform on this shroud before we hang it up? - I, for one, should like to scrub my... - I finally get it. Thank you. No frigging way. Cool it, Hat. Coldcast? Nothing could have... That was like 15 suns exploding in his face. I made the mistake of treating you people like people. No sonar. Can't smell him either. Scorched air. But now I understand better. I'm getting a tight sphincter here, Chester. Shut your gob. I understand now what the world wants. What it needs. Ow! Something bit me. - Bit you? - Pam! - Do something. - Do what? He's poisoned the zoo. The buggers want out. He is supposed to be dead. - She's not breathing. Damn it, Chester. - She's dead? Bugger me. He's playing it our way. Leave her. Blister the land and flush him out. I can't. Not after a blast like that. Call the ship and get Pam to sick bay. Guys. The world needs people in charge... ...who are willing to put the animals down. - Is...? Is that Superman? - Not anymore. - Pam! - She's dead. Let her go. Hang tight. Everyone knows Superman can't do magic. Don't let him separate us. Here's a little ancient Chinese secret. How? He's shielded by magic. That wind is clocking in at 500 miles a minute. His body may not be taking any hits... ...but his lungs just collapsed from the vacuum. Do something. Find his brain and shut it down. He thought this through. - He's been playing us this whole time. - Chester. He killed Pam and the Hat. Get With it. Bunny, get us out of here. What the hell are you doing? Pam is still up there. - We can't just... - He won't do anything here. Not with the sheep around us. Bunny, get ready to port again. The second he shows his S, I'm gonna flatten this whole city. Chester, wait. Holy sh... Where did he go? Where did he freaking go? Orbit. He went into orbit at Mach seven. If you had super-hearing, any second you'd hear the pop. Oh, no. You crazy son of a bitch. You killed my team. Your team of killers. Now guess what. They won't be killing anyone else. See? I finally bought what you've been selling. You bloody psychopath! How does it feel, Black? How does it feel to be deconstructed? To be the victim? To watch your dreams die? Let me show you, you self-righteous hypocrite. Heat vision? You can barely stand, let alone fry my face. I'm not aiming at your face. You're not dying. I'm thinking it... ...but why can't I feel my power? I scanned your brain for abnormalities. And when I found one... ...I out it out. - What? - Heat vision. Focused through your pupils like a scalpel. Instant lobotomy. This isn't you. You don't do this. I do now. No! It doesn't have to be that way, Superman. You taught us that. No. He taught you that he's no better than the rest of us. You all saw. Everyone on Earth saw what you did to us. And they know you're no better. There's nothing special about you. Yes, they did see. They saw the ugliness of violence as a solution and it frightened them. It frightened me too when I decided to cross that line and do what you do. It's so easy. Anger, vengeance. Luckily, I'm not you. And I never will be. You killed my team! Look at this place! Chester. I thought you were supposed to be the sharp one. Boys. - Hell of a performance. - To be fair, I had some help. Your sister, to start. Her files were very thorough. Especially regarding the idiosyncrasies of your brain. But I knew they wouldn't be enough. You're right about me. I would never put civilians in harm's way. I Won '1' kill. But you would. So I made sure I had backup As for your people... ...they're fine. Nursing headaches I don't even wanna think about. But very much alive as they're stripped of their powers... ...and prepped for transport to a supermax prison. That's why I had to let you knock me around for so long. I didn't have a nifty teleporter. Bunny, you rotten clot, get me out of... But I do now. You'd be surprised how fast Bunny agreed to help me... ...when one of the super-bots promised to return her to her home dimension. You...? You think that's it? It's not over, you poncy twit. If you think I'll just go to jail and rot, you're living in a dream world! Good. Dreams save us. Dreams lift us up and transform us into something better. And on my soul, I swear that until my dream... ...of a world where dignity, honor and justice are the reality we all share... ...I'll never stop fighting. Ever. Olsen, get the crowd reactions. Perry loves crowds. You ever scare me like that again, I'll kill you. If I ever scare me like that again, it's a deal. Can we go so I can kiss you now?
