Hey Paul, I was just calling you. No, no, I had a client meeting outside so I'm out of the office. I'm at... What? Again? No. No, no. It's okay. You're the one who's gonna have the horrible evening. God, that audit is going on forever. Ah. No, I won't wait up for you. I'll probably just fall asleep in front of the TV. Okay. Bye-bye. Hi. Table for one? - Oh, no, I just want to take out. Do you still have that chocolate cake with the crushed almonds. - Yes. My husband used to love that. If I could get a takeout for two, that'd be great. I'll check if we have any left. I'm so sorry. We just sold our last... slice. Hello? - Sorry, I don't know what came over me, but, I just forgot what time you said you would be home. - Late. Oh... late. Yeah... right. Okey. Well, let me let you get back to your audit. Okey. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Paul! Paul, wait! Paul! Wait! You' re not serious?! - Stop it, Lucy. Paul, you can't go! - Stop it! Lady, are you buying something? - Y-yes. Sure, sure. - What? A newspaper. Hi. Huh? What? A rope. - Hey, what is she saying? What would you like? I want... - Hey, what is she saying? What would you like? - I want a rope. I want a rope! Rope. - Rope? Okeydokey. One rope is coming up. Is it a good length? - Yeah. I'll take this too. Oh, no, no. Listen, this is not for sale. I'm saving it for tonight... - How much do you want? Just take it. Who cares? She gave you over $200. Why she would do that? What can I say? People like me. - What on earth would she want a rope for? Are you gonna pay for that? Excu... are you all right? What difference does it make?! Yeah?! - I... we just met in the hallway just now, and, I think I saw you earlier in the store and I just want to make sure that you're all right. I'm fine. But you, you don't seem fine. - I'm fine! - Sorry. Okey. Listen. This is gonna sound really strange, but how do I know that you're not standing on a chair with a noose around your neck? I really, really, really don't want to get involved, but... Oh, good god. Okay. It's... it's all right. Nothing is ever gonna be all right again. Ever. Oh, no. Stop that... young lady, stop! Stop drinking. Give me that. I'll get you some water. Alcohol is a depressant. It's the last thing in the world you need right now. Y-you're, like, the nicest person I've ever met. Why would you do this for a complete stranger? Oh, well, enough about me. Okay. What happened to make you so... sad? I can't... I can't talk about it. - Well, sometimes it's good to talk. No, really open up, spill out all the gory details. I'm itching to. - I'm absolutely sure. There's this man. I love him... and I thought we were gonna get married, have children, a life together, but.. But... - If I tell you this, you're not gonna like me anymore. Well, I'm sure I'll like you just as much as I... like you right now. Are you married? - Yes. But I'm a big girl. - He's married, too. Small world. - But he doesn't love his wife. Paul and her got married when they were practically children, and it hasn't meant anything in years, so I thought he was gonna leave her. But tonight she kept phoning and phoning and he thought she sounded suspicious. So he said he had to go home before she checked up on his alibi, and I said, "Well, why not tell her the truth?" Right? Isn't it meaner to let her think she's paranoid and then in a month say, "Guess what, I love someone else", right? I mean, a clean break hurts less, right? W-what do you think? Well, what I think has no... relevance. But you must have an opinion. - What did he say? He said I can't understand what it's like to be married. And whose fault is that? How could he go home to her? We should be making love on this couch like all those other, wonderful times and he... Do you think this means he doesn't really love me? Well... he said that his marriage to... I don't know her name. He calls her "the wife." Ah. The wife. - He doesn't like talking about her. It makes him uncomfortable. I'm sure it would. But, he did say they haven't had sex in two years. What kind of a woman must she be, right? I can't go two days without sex. Who can? I mean, II've been multiorgasmic since I was 8. How nice for you. Are you sure that he's telling you the truth? I mean, I know marriage. I know marriage and I'm sure that they still have sex sometimes. Well, that's... You think he... He's been lying to me? If he's just been using me, I don't think I could take it. I-I'm just gonna take it in... Hello?! No, no, I'm not at home. Well, when you said that you were gonna work late, I decided to, to go visit my mom. Join me? No. No, that's not a good idea. Oh, when will I be home? So many questions. Well... it'll be a while. Yeah, I'll be right there, mom. I got to go. Bye. Okay. So, you were just getting ready to tell... oh, no! Just let me die, please. Young lady, listen. Listen, listen, listen, please. Suicide is an impulse act. If you'd just wait a little while, I'm sure you'll change your mind. That's right, I should do it really fast, okay? Just, can I ask you a favor? If I just get brain damage do you promise to hold a pillow over my face? - Oh, my God! I feel dizzy. What's wrong? I haven't eaten yet. - I'm so sorry. Do you want some grapes? Oh, my God. It's okay. It's okay. It's Paul. What do I do? - What? Oh, you're asking me? - You're so wise... Don't answer it. - Hi. I'm sorry. He wants to come over. - I guess his wife isn't home after all. What about your wife? Yeah. He says he doesn't care what she thinks. Well, then why doesn't he just ask her for a divorce instead of coming over here... for... You're so right. Paul, I refuse to see you again until you ask your wife for a divorce. That was smart, right? Yeah. I hope so. I've always been attracted to older men. I slept with my english teacher when I was in Madrid. And when I came here as an au pair, the dads... Well, the au pair thing didn't work out. But, just between you and I, I'm not as young as I seem. Oh, no. You couldn't be. When Paul and I get married, I don't want one of those dead marriages, you know where those couples have nothing to talk about. but what chores to do, what TV show to watch. I'm gonna have sex three times a day until we die. Jesus, three times a day. How would you even find the time? What do you do? - I don't know. How can you not know what you do? Well, really, I'm an actress. But I haven't had a part in a while, so I do temp work in offices. That's how I met Paul. I was taking some papers into his office. The door was closed, so I thought they'd gone out for lunch. You know, I just opened the door, and he was just there at his desk, his head in his hands, crying. He was crying? Yeah, he was crying. He told me later that he felt like his life meant nothing, like he might as well be dead already. Well, we all feel like that sometimes. I mean, even I feel like that sometimes. But do I screw the office temp? No. I-I... I wake up every morning and I do the laundry and I cook and I go to work and I visit my mother, who doesn't even remember who I am. Okay, sometimes I... watch TV. I talk about what groceries I'm gonna buy. But you're nothing, nothing like Paul's wife. You're so different. You're so kind. Your husband must love you so much. No. He doesn't. Are you sure? - Yeah. Does he have affairs? Yes. At least one. Oh, my God. That's terrible. Is it still going on? - Yes. Oh, shit. Well, what are you gonna do? You mean am I gonna go buy a bottle of scotch and drink it straight from the bottle? No. Am I gonna put a noose around my neck? No. Pills, I can get pills. Women can always get pills. And who cares if one day you just happen to take too many? Not your husband. No, no. Then he can live happily ever after with a bouncing bimbo. No. I can't die. I need to stay alive so that I can destroy his future happiness. I actually have a reason to live. For a minute there, I thought I didn't. Oh, my God. You're not who you've been pretending to be tonight. What?! I recognize you. Oh, I'm sorry. - I-I'm sorry. I thought you were one of those people that are, you know happy with a nothing life, a boring marriage, an office job. But you're not. You're like me, and you're so much like me! I am nothing like you. We are exact opposites. Give us any situation, situation "x", and you would choose to do "b," while I would do "a." And even when I was your age, I would not have slept with a sobbing businessman. I would not ever be an actress. I would never be a poet or an astrologer. Actress and astrologer are not equivalent. - Well, they're close enough. It's true, there was a moment there where I was a foot reflexologist. But that's scientifically proven, so it's... My point is, that I would do everything differently if I were you and you would do everything differently if you were me, too. Although it's hard to imagine that our lives could be any worse than they are right now. So how much worse would our lives be if I would do what you would do and you would do what I would do? That's such a brilliant idea! - What idea? I haven't had an idea. No, but you're right. We've been feeling and thinking and deciding for ourselves, and our lives are a mess. We should try the opposite! - Decide one thing and then do the other? I mean like, like I get to think what you should do, and you get to think what I should do, like when you told me to stop drinking and not kill myself. I would be drunk and dead if I'd made up my own mind instead of letting you make up my mind for me. Maybe that just means that... I make better decisions than you do. No offense, Madelyn, but your life sounds crappier than mine. My life sounds crappier than yours? I'm not the one married to a man who's cheating on me. Look at it this way, we're both self-destructive people or we wouldn't be involved with men that treat us like shit. But we would not be self-destructive if we were making decisions for someone else, 'cause I don't want to destroy your life and you don't want to destroy my life. No, of course not. So, the way to fix our lives is to stop making our own decisions and let the other one make them instead. Not on little things, like "what color lipstick should I wear?" I'd go pinker if I were you, but on, on, on the big stuff, you know? We call each other before we decide anything major. You would really do anything I said? Thank you so much. I didn't realize I didn't have any money. No, no, it's okay. I got it. So, should you stay with your husband or should you leave him? I should... - I get to decide. I'm the objective one. Subjective. I always get those two mixed up. - Obje... objective. Objective. Okay. Think. Okay, if he loves her, you should kick him out. If he loves her, you're gonna get dumped soon anyway. But maybe... maybe he doesn't love her. Maybe she's just some bimbo. You know, how long have you been married? A long time. - And would you throw all those years away over some silly fling? Yes. - No. - No. - No. You're such a nice person. If he still loves you, you'll find a way to make things work. And if not, once the bimbo is out of the picture, you dump the creep. So, first step... You have to find out who he loves - you or his girlfriend. Okay? So you go home and ask your husband, what's his name? Fred. - Fred. You say, "Fred, do you still love me?" And then call and tell me what he said and I'll tell you what to do next. Okay. - Okay. - I feel a little bit like Alice in wonderland. Oh, my god! I spent half my life feeling like that girl. Isn't that incredible? - Yes. Wow! We're so much alike. - No, we're nothing alike. There you go. That's your mission. And when I hear from Paul, you'll get to tell me what to do. Okay. I go this way. I have to take the subway. You don't live in my building? No. I... I saw you buying the rope, and I-I followed you home. Oh, my God. You really are the kindest person I've ever met. Hug? I'm gonna work so hard to make you happy. Bye! - Okay. Bye-bye. Good night. Don't... Call me. What are you looking at?! Hi, mom. Henry? No. It's me. I got you something. Do you want it? I got you some ice cream. Here you go. Now... It's your favorite. Thank you, Henry. Hey. I'm in here. You've been working late a lot of evenings. Yeah. Work's been rough. Are you... Are... Do you still love me? Of course I love you. God, visits to your mother always get you down. Uh, where's my sweatshirt? On the chair. I'm just gonna go catch the end of the game. Okey, I've asked him. - And what did he say? He said he loved me, but I don't know that I believed him. And frankly, I don't know that I care. So, now let's talk about what I want you to say to your married man. I've got it! You have to tell your husband you're in love with someone else. Why on earth would I do that? - To see if he gets jealous. If he doesn't love you anymore, it won't be that big a deal, other than the male ego - you know, "is my penis bigger than his?" If penis size comes up, just tell him they're both the same. That takes the whole penis issue off the table. But if he gets really angry and the penis thing if off the table, that means he loves you. Then call me, but not till after midnight so I can tell you what Paul said about the ultimatum. Wait. Uh, u-under this, the rules of this pact thingy, you're not allowed to call him until I give my permission. Well, I'm not calling him. Every night, when his wife is brushing her teeth, he calls me to say he loves me. You didn't brush your teeth. - I don't feel like brush my teeth. You always brush your teeth. - Well, not tonight. But you never miss. You use your electric toothbrush. You said your dad had gum disease. You want to be safe. - Good night. It's three o'clock. - Oh, my god! The nursing home... my mother! Hello? - He didn't call me. I'll be right back. - Is it the nursing home? No. It's 3:00 in the morning. - He didn't call. And you were supposed to call me after you told your husband you were having an affair. Well, I haven't told him yet. - Why not? - Because I got sleepy. How can you sleep when you don't know if you're gonna be married tomorrow or not? Well, maybe now it won't be so easy. - Why do you think he didn't call? Maybe his wife forgot. to brush her teeth. Oh, no, no, no. She always brushes her teeth. She's got, like, this obsessive thing about her gums. Paul thinks it's stupid, but he's afraid to tell her 'cause he thinks she will make him listen to more gross stories about her dad's teeth falling out. No wonder he doesn't love her anymore, right? Who would want to live with someone like that? Hello? Hello? Madelyn? Who was that? Who was it? - That was a man, a man I am seeing, a man who's so crazy about me, he calls me in the middle of the night. A man who loves every single thing about me! Hej! Hey, I made breakfast... Your favorites - french toast, coffee, orange juice. I think I'll just go straight to the office. - Oh. Okay. I'll see you tonight, then, right? Hey, we should, go for dinner. We haven't done that in a while. Just tell me who he is! French toast. Oh, my god! Oh, you're his first choice. I'm so happy for you. I really hope this plan works out for me, too. I wanted to be his only choice. Oh, yeah. Well, I want to be the only choice, too, but, you know, maybe that doesn't happen - the whole soul-mate thing. I don't need a soul mate. But if there's going to be a second, at least let it be a distant second, You know, "distant enough that you don't have sex with" second. Okay. Maybe a... drunken kiss at the christmas party. But that's my limit. And now I'm supposed to stay married to a man who has a really close second and has suddenly decided that he wants me because he's jealous of an imaginary somebody. It's a fake fuck! It just seems like a really puny life. Well, maybe he was lonely or busy with work, and she was right there saying, "hey, big boy. You look like you need a hug." We're all human. But to risk... everything... for a... - A slut. It's hard. I know. You know, when we retire... were going to move to Asia... For a little bit, for a year. Do you know where that is, Asia? We've been saving and saving for it. We even talked about moving to the south of France. Do you know that if you live, more than commuting distance to Paris it doesn't cost any more than living here? But you're way too young to think about retirement. Retirement is what people like us look forward to. Retirement is, you know, when you finally get to do what makes you happy. Our goal is to retire as soon as humanly possible. And now I won't even be able to have my home. I will grow old alone. You live your life according to certain ideas and expectations. And then suddenly... It's gone. But why not forgive him? He was willing to forgive your affair. You'd be even. - I didn't have an affair. Well, yeah, but that's so easy to fix. It's not like it's hard to find a man who wants to fuck. I don't want to fuck another man. - But it would fix everything. And sometimes, you have to think outside the box. Oh, I-I've got to get to work. But w-we haven't talked about me yet. Paul hasn't called. Should I call him? No. Definitely do not call him. I was afraid you'd say that. I shouldn't have given him an ultimatum. You know what? Being a second choice is not that bad and gradually you can work your way up closer and closer to the first choice until maybe, one day, you get to be her. What if he's dead? That's the worst thing of being the other woman. We never know when they're dead. Who's gonna send us an invitation to the funeral? Oh, my god. Do you think he's dead? Men who don't call are never dead. - Okay. And you have to get on with your life. You can't keep waiting for him to call. He is my life. What about your career? Well, that's a big word, for a tv commercial and a walk-on in a fringe festival play. Oh, my God. Career. I'm so late! Okay, but what do I do today? I want you to... think... right? Think. About... How to make your career something that is more than just imaginary. Okay, I can do, okay. And what else? I'll call you. - When? - Soon. - Soon? Okey! Hi. - They're all waiting. Shit. This... this put in my office. - Yes. Here she is. - We had to start without you. You know I hate talking to these people. Hi, hi, hi. I'm Madelyn Reed. I'm here at Jameson research, we conduct research on... everything from the, latest economic trends to marketing strategies to... and this is where you come in, individual purchasing decisions. Okay. So... My colleague Keith here... - Hi. - Hi. Is going to show you some... covers for the latest cookbook. "Smart heart meals for the happy family." Okay, let's start off with some general questions. Maggie, is this the kind of cookbook you would buy? Yes. I would definitely buy it. I love their kitchen. Their kitchen... good. Kit-chen. How about you, Tyler? I think it could be a good birthday present for my mom. My dad's had heart problems. What about you, Sam? I don't like the wife. What do you think of the wife, Sarah? - I love her earrings. Earrings. - I just don't think she's very hot. Well, she's making lunch for her husband, so how hot would she be? Another opinion. Carla. - She's smiling, but I don't think she looks happy. Well, again, making lunch for the husband, okay? So what do we think about the husband? He's kind of cute. - Yeah. Cute. Well, it's easy to be cute when you're the one being waited on hand and foot. But, what does she have to do to get him to make lunch for her, huh? Sleep with the mailman? Madelyn? - Can we get another opinion? Lindy. I like his smile. Really? Well, I think that he looks just a little bit smug. See here in the second one? Right there? I don't know... - No. Look, look, look. Do you really think that he appreciates her? Here she's gone to all the trouble to make him this really lifesaving meal, and he's probably sitting there like Sam over here, thinking "Oh, wait. She's not hot anymore. And if I'm gonna stay alive, what I need to do is shtup that bimbo." What bimbo? - I don't see a bimbo. There's always a bimbo. And even if you get over the first bimbo, there's gonna be another bimbo, because, you know, it's not like people fall for the bimbo because of the uniqueness of the bimbo. But that doesn't mean that the bimbo will last forever, because the illusion of immortality is not the same as immortality itself! Okay? Mr. Smug face over there can fuck all the bimbos he can get, and at the end of the day, he will still end up alone. If you think that once the bimbos go to wherever it is that bimbos go, that you can crawl back to that wonderful, wonderful wife who has made you all those beautiful lunches, then, you've got another thing coming, you bastard! Madelyn, are you... all right? Why don't you go to my office? - Excuse me. I'm just gonna go get something I left in my coat pocket. I'm very sorry. Madelyn? - I know how to open the door! This is most unexpected, but don't move. We'll be serving coffee. Bimbo. Just a minute. What's wrong? - Nothing. I just... I got thirsty. You're our most reliable employee. - Don't call me reliable! Reliable is good! I used to think so, but I'm not so sure anymore. Okay, I know I shouldn't drink, but life feels so painful drunk that I don't want to know what it feels like sober. These just came for you. Aren't you lucky? Pretty secretary. They're always so pretty. Ah. "To the love of my life. Paul." - Is it your anniversary? Nope. Oh, my god. He was unfaithful with some bimbo. Yes. Oh, my god. Yes. I'm being traded in like an old car. Oh, it is so good to finally have someone sane to talk about this with. This is the best day of my life. Surely not. I've known that these are bad times, Keith, but I've never thought of you as a cruel man. I have something to confess. Well, can it wait for an even more wonderful day? Oh, shit. My phone's ringing. This is not soon! Was that Paul? - No. It's just someone that I made a really strange contract with. It's complicated. It's really complicated. Oh, Madelyn. I've wanted to say this since the first day you walked into the office, looking for a job. The moment I saw you all decked out in your gray suit and black pumps, I knew it! I love you. You love me? - With all my heart and soul. You love me? Well, I mean, I've always known that, you like chatting with me, but I never knew that you loved me. There's so many things about my life I don't know. What else don't I know? Maybe I have secret superpowers. Let's seize the moment! What... what moment exactly? They go by so quickly. Oh, Madelyn, just say the word. - What word would that be? Say yes! - But to what, exactly? To me. But... - No, no, no. No buts. But, but, but... You're married! Madelyn, one word from you and Lydia's gone, history. Oh, look. My bottle's empty. I'm just gonna take a... A mental-health day. You know, seldom more deserved, but under the circumstances, a highly unachievable goal. - You... You will at least think about it, will you? Honestly, I'll do my very best not to think about it, but I'll p-probably fail. So this is the best that I can do. Yes! If this man you're seeing... Paul. I love to say his name. Paul. - Yes, if this Paul... and his wife decided that starting a whole new life with whole new people was just too exhausting, what would you do? - I'd kill myself. But wouldn't you think, "Wow! A whole new start"? No, I'd kill myself. - Okay. How did that thinking on your career go? Well, I looked at the list for this week's auditions, even for parts that don't pay, and there's nothing. Okay. Well, let me look at it. Here. You're so nice. I thought you'd forgotten all about my problems, and you've been thinking so much about me. Thank you. Let me see here. Get out the old... Okay. You don't need these. Okay. Aha. Gang member... Carjacker, hit man, hooker... Aha! Shakespeare. Ha! What could be better? A TV commercial? - Ah, but a play! It's long! And commercials you don't have to learn so many lines, and I can use my speciality. Your speciality? Want to see? - Oh, yeah. See, I turn away and then look back and give a little smile. It used to have a wink in it, too, but this director told me it was too much. Just tell me which one you prefer. I'll show you. No wink. Wink. But you can do more than that. Not that much, no. I flunked dance classes, and... You flunked dance classes. Okay. Okay. Well, you just have to keep trying. We can all do more. No, that's what we do. We work hard, we get better, then we analyze our mistakes, we work hard again, and we get even better. That's life! And then somebody pulls the rug out from under us and we wish we were dead, but let's not think about that. Okey. The relevant point is that if you were in a play right now, you would not be pining over... - Paul? Oh, look. Auditions at 7:00 tonight. Maybe you'll be discovered. Maybe you'll move to California. They'll laugh at me. - You're just nervous. I hate auditions. Just sitting there all alone, waiting for someone to call your name and then they just say, "Stop! Stop!" And what if Paul comes and I'm not home? You have to do what I say. Remember, I did what you said. I asked my husband if he loved me and then I told him I was sleeping with an imaginary man. Going to an audition is a lot less than that. I'll go if you come with me. - Nope. That is not part of... Wait a minute. That is actually a great idea, because if I go and I see that they do laugh at you... - Yeah. We can start looking at alternate career options. Because you do not need to spend the rest of your life waiting for a man to call. Oh, excuse me. Is that Fred? - No. Keith. He's a co-worker who just told me that he's in love with me. Oh, my God. See? I told you. It's so easy to find someone to fuck, and he loves you, so it's great! You just fuck this, Keith, and then you and your husband will be even for real. You can't make me fuck him! That's just too much of a pact. Oh, please don't be sad. We'll find someone for you to fuck that you like. Maybe we'll meet someone special at the audition. down from the waist, they are centaurs, though woman all above. Don't even think about it. but to the girdle do the gods inherit, beneath all are fiends there's hell, there's sulfurous, there's the pit burning, scalding, stench, consumption! Fie! Fie! Phones off! Just pick it up anywhere. Anywhere at all. Keith, can't talk. say 'aye' and 'no' to every... Why do we need a breakfast meeting? We can cover that campaign at the office. No, we don't need alone time, Keith. when the rain came... Could we have silence, please? - Sorry. Goodbye. Don't call back. the wind to make me chatter... and the thunder would not peace at my bidding. there... I'm just gonna put it on vibrate, okay? - Yeah. there, I smelt them out. Next! What shall Cordelia do? Love and be silent. Oop! Then poor Cordelia! And yet not so, since I am sure that my love is more richer than my mouth. Nothing. Nothing? Nothing, my lord. nothing shall come of nothing, speak again! They are so much better than me. unhappy that I am, I cannot heave my heart... You can't be as bad as that. You really think so? Sure. Some people are born with more talent, but it's not rocket science. It's just pretending. You're pretty. And you're... Pretty. Any no-talent idiot that works hard is bound to be better than that. Wow! If my family had given me that kind of encouragement, my whole life would be different. those duties back as I as are fit, obey you, love you... I'd be the one sleeping next to Brad Pitt right now. why have my sisters husbands, if they say they love you all? happily, when I shall wed... That lord whose hand... What? Keith, what? What? No. No. It's not great news that my husband is in love with another woman. No, I don't think that's how God answers prayers. I must have silence! I'm sorry. So young. Oh, my god. So young and so untender? Thank you. Thank you. That will be all. Thanks. Stop. Stop! Next. Where am I? Fair daylight? I am mightily abused. What's this play about anyway? I should even die with pity, to see another thus. I will not swear these on my hands. Oh, it's my husband. - Let me talk to him. I don't know what to say. - Let me talk to him. Why? I'll tell him what a bastard he is for cheating on a saint like you. Give me the phone. - No, no, no, no, no. Hey, I can't talk right now. No, not because I'm in bed with someone. Not yet. I know I'm not at home. So what? You go out all the time. Why can't I go out sometimes? not an hour more... No. I did not agree to have dinner with you. No, no, no, no, no. You said, 'let's have dinner.' and I said, I don't know what I said, but it wasn't 'yes.' I am not with my lover. No, I'm definitely not naked! You cannot tell by my voice that I'm naked. Okay. Why should I? You don't tell me everywhere you go. Why should I tell you where I go? No, please don't say that you love me! Because! I don't believe you anymore, and I am so sick of your lies! No. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I like your lies. Bring on the lies. What? Because I didn't know that life was this shitty little nasty thing and I don't want to know! So just spoon me full of ice cream and tell me... That love lasts forever. And that all dreams come true. Oh, yeah. Sure. Just like my mom. Aha. Hello, dementia. I'm over here. What? No. No. Don't... Shut up! Just shut up! I am not the love of anyone's life and this is not about who I'm fucking! You're hired! The audacity of it! Just bursting into character! I hadn't even thought about a woman playing Lear. I'm sorry, but I... - She wants top billing. And the whole businessperson look, I like it. She gets to keep the wardrobe. That's a deal-breaker. The corporate empire is collapsing. Lear is reduced to begging on Wall Street. The madness of capitalism! - You don't... - She loves your ideas! You have to suck up to the director. You're young for the part, but that's been done before. Laurence Olivier played it at 39, Gielgud at 26, and people had their children much younger in Shakespeare's day. So, so, so... Should they still be daughters or sons? And who should play the fool? Speciality. Thank you, yes! Yes! And, of course, I want to thank God. Thank you. I have a part in a play! Shakespeare! Does the fool has lots of lines? You're gonna be nice and busy. I want to play with my new best friend. You can't quit. And you have to do whatever I say. I thought that... Mainly it was gonna be me telling you what to do. I'm older. I'm wiser. I'm... better equipped to have information. and, in this case, I'm a big bitcher, pig bicture. Big... Kind of person. But you were so right. I haven't thought about Paul... For the last 20 minutes. I haven't gone 20 minutes without thinking about him since the first time he kissed me. Do you want to hear about our first kiss? It was like the best first kiss ever. Maybe another time. - Okay. I really, really want to kiss him right now. Do you really think I should not call him? I'm sure. Absolutely. Start thinking about the play, learning all the lines. Well, maybe tonight when the wicked witch of the west is brushing her yucky teeth, he will call me. It just seems so strange. You've always brushed your teeth before bed. Can't we just go to sleep? Is... his penis bigger than mine? No, no. It's an amazing coincidence. They're exactly the same size. You've measured them? Why won't you tell me what you were doing last night? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Oh, I'll be home late, again, tonight. Who is he?! It's the office. I better take it. Well, you're heading out. We'll talk later. Oh, no. I'll wait for you to finish your call. You don't have to wait. - I don't mind. Go ahead - take it. Where'd I leave the notes on that audit? I think they're upstairs. This is Paul. Damn it. I got to work late tonight. Yeah? I'll talk to you later. Who was that? We need to talk. No. I'm not having the talk, okay? You're not telling me you're leaving me for another man. Sit down. I can't keep this up. So... There is no other man. Yeah, right. Well, then who keeps calling you, then? Just a... friend. Just a friend. Okay. What does that mean? Huh? That you've seen him but you haven't had sex yet? Madelyn. How far have you gone? And where did you do it? Huh? Here? Upstairs, in our home? In our bed? Why does the thought of someone else wanting me suddenly make me irresistible? I should go. What's your hurry? Huh? Is he somebody you work with? I would like to think that if I were having an affair, it would be with someone more interesting than the men with whom I work. So help me god, if that's him, I'll kill him. It can't be him. He doesn't exist! Oh, fuck! I knew I should have spent more on the flowers. It was so unexpected. The phone just rang, and it was Paul. I would have called you to see if I should see him or not, but he was in such a hurry, and really, I mean, I have to see him again someday, right? It's not like our paths will never cross again and we could be really old and, "Oh, my God. You were the love of my life." So, he's coming over here tonight. Is it okay if I have sex with him? If he called you, sure. Yeah. Okay. But if you called him... I know you didn't, but if you had, that would be different. It would? You wouldn't want to be a home wrecker, would you, Lucy? Okay, see you at rehearsal tonight. If you're not too busy. Is this... I'm confused. Oh, my god. Yellow roses? His favorite? My god. I knew something was up. This morning he was singing. He only sings when he's happy. I went online to check the credit card, a florist, but I had no idea. My husband is gay?! In my heart, I knew it. I knew it the first time we had sex. Wait. Your husband is the one who sent my wife flowers? You have a wife? He isn't gay? Oh. Well, who is she? Madelyn Reed. Rings a bell, but just a tinkle. Do you have a photo? Yeah. That Madelyn?! My husband is Keith Halbertson. I knew it was a co-worker. Don't tell her you know. She'll just deny it. And we need proof so that we can soak them in the divorce. Wait. Well... What do we know? Do you think they've slept together yet, or... Did we catch them in time? He... He calls her in the middle of the night. Oh, shit! Just shit, shit, shit. I don't mean to be rude, but I was just heading out. How can they do this to us? Don't they know how much they're hurting us? Have they no morals? To perform such an act of cruelty, of... selfishness, of lust, a sin against good people who promised 'for better of worse, till death do you part,' who'd look after them if they had cancer or they went blind or... or who would give them a kidney. What kind of scum would do that? Sneak around, lie, have sex for kicks just 'cause they were bored? My God. There is nothing more disgusting than infidelity. Don't you agree? I must love you. And sue to know you better. Sir, I shall study... Deserving. He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. Ah, the king is coming. The king is coming. Your line. Oh... Can you carry on without me? You're Lear. Oh, I know. Can I speak to you in private? We have no secrets here. We are a team. One for all and all for one. Team! Hurrah! - Okay. Well, I know you're depending on me to play Lear, because, well, I mean, all the other Lears sucked. And I'm usually very reliable, and I'm usually sober, but, I can't do this. Yes, you can. We believe in you. We believe in you. Okay. What I mean is that I'm going through something right now with someone you know, and if you only knew what it was, you would understand, okay? And everything that I had... everything, everything is suddenly just gone! You know, kaput! Pow! And it's all been replaced by madness. Hold that feeling. Why would I hold it? It hurts. You're so lucky. You're already there. Shh! She's coming. Okay, don't say anything that I said. Did I say anything? Okay, just act natural, act natural. You're actors. You know how to do that. Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. What happened? - He didn't come. I guess he loves his wife more. I don't know how I'd get through this without you. I adore subtext. She needs a script. Thank you. Aren't you gonna answer that? - No. What does that mean? - It means I'm asleep. Did you split up with him? - He doesn't exist. I know more than you think I know. I'll answer it. I'll tell the bastard what I think of him fucking my wife. Hold it. What?! Hey. I called the pastor for you. He's on his way. I don't really want to... Speak to a complete stranger. I'm sure he'll make you feel better. He's a lot of fun. He did card tricks at the christmas party. Well, in that case, I think I'll just head down the hall and get some coffe and make some phone calls. If he does show up, tell him not to wait around on my account. Thanks for taking care of her. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I haven't turned this thing off, day or night, for the past two years, just in case I got the call. I got the call. Me too. Mother or father? - Mother. You? Father. Last one? Yeah. It's... It's scary. Why? We've been the adults for a long time. Maybe because we're next. Do I feel more mortal? Yes, but, little, little, little, too, you know? Huh. - Like a kid who can't go home when she screws up because home just died in her sleep. Dad, I need money. Mom, I quit school. Dad, could you explain women to me? Mom, he broke my heart. Those... were the days. You? - Oh, yes, please. Favorite memories? When I was 30, I'd had a really bad miscarriage. I had really wanted kids. And everybody was saying the right things, you'll have other chances, cheer up. my husband said, he was trying to make me feel better, he said, maybe we should just save enough money for a down payment first. And I thought I had to say all that same kind of crap. So then, my mother came to visit me in the hospital, and, I said, "I'll be fine." and she just climbed up onto my hospital bed and held me and just let me cry and cry. That's my mom. Wow. You? Well... I decided on my 16th birthday that I was gonna quit high school and just hitchhike all over South America and nobody was gonna stop me. Now, suddenly, I'm the coolest guy in the school, where I was not popular at all. I went home, and I'm packing up everything in my backpack in my room. My old man walks in. He says, You know, you can tell them I wouldn't let you. And I thought, how did he know? I mean, I was petrified. And I said, Dad, they're just gonna say, 'you should have gone anyway. He said, Then you tell them, I'll break every bone in your body if you go. This man had never even laid a finger on me. So I went back to school the next day, and I said, my dad stormed into my room with his belt out, threatening to beat me to a pulp if I dared... He saved my honor. What do you think is happening to them? You mean, like, where are they? Right now? Right now. - Or is this it? It's over, the only chance you get. What do you like best about being alive? Less and less. No, really, I mean, maybe this is how it works. If you're lucky and you die old, that your life has just become so disappointing and so lonely, so loveless, so empty, so achy-breaky painful, that when death finally does come along, you say... Where have you been? Oh, come on. You're just saying that to cheer me up. But come on. Give up spiked whiskey coffee and nursing-home waiting rooms? Ice cream. I like ice cream. Wind. I like, I love windy days. Well, kisses. Not, you know, kiss-kiss, 'see you later' kiss, but kisses like... Like... Like the first time you ever kiss somebody. You know? Kisses. When was our last first kiss? And did we even know it was our last? Then our first kisses were gone forever. I just had drunk sex with a stranger in a nursing-home waiting room. What do you do after sex with a stranger in a nursing-home... waiting room? I know. It's kind of... Awkward. Well, we're gonna have to... Have to see each other again - breakfast or something, otherwise it'll be the most surrealist experience of our lives. Well, it would have some competition for me. Now, I've got a-a busy day. I've got a funeral to plan. Oh, shit. So do I. Do you have any recommendations on people who work... I think, I'm gonna use... Amberson's. That's where I buried my dad. - Amberson's? Amberson's on Hunter? - Yes. Yeah. Maybe I'll see you there. That is potent stuff. I mean, I'm actually gonna, grab a cab, leave my car here. Do you want to share a cab? No. No, thanks. I just, I have phone calls to make and... I'll just... stay. Okay. Well... Thanks. Bye. - Thanks. Don't say thanks. - No, no. I told you it'd be easy. - I didn't even ask his name. A complete stranger. I love sex like that. You had me at 'hello.' Oh, and now you and your husband can stay married, 'cause you'll be even. I don't even know why I'm doing the things I'm doing. I don't know why I just told you that but who else would I admit it to? Well, you told me 'cause that's what best friends do, right? Uh, yeah. And I have something to confess. Paul didn't call me yesterday morning. I called him. You could tell, right? Wow. You know me so well. That's why I've always wanted a best friend. But he did call me today. - He... called you today? His mother-in-law died, so now the 'wife' really needs him. The wife. How long do you think he has to wait until he tells her he's leaving her? Two weeks? Well, I don't know that there's a set time for that kind of thing. Maybe I can google it. But wouldn't it be great if he came to the opening night? And my dream is coming true, I'm an actress! Google it? We that are young shall never see so much nor live. So long. We made it all the way to the end of the play! I can't believe I only fell off the stage once. Oh, it was twice. That was... That was... That was... So horrible. So, so horrible! Except for my star. Bless you. All of you were bad! But then... there was you. Yeah. What was that thing you did when Lear says, Oh, ho! 'tis foul? You have no talent whatsoever. Not a single drop. You are a talentless void! An empty pit of ineptitude! Well, Madelyn says life is not about talent. Life is about working hard and getting better bit by bit. So I just have to keep trying. And trying. And trying. You were great. Do you want to hang out at my place? I got to go home to Fred. You can say it. I should give up acting. Maybe... We shoud go hang out. Court holy water indoors is so much better than this rainwater out of doors. Good nuncle, ask thy daughters forgiveness, for here's a... something pities... something... night. - I couldn't even do easy acting. You know what? I only got the commercial 'cause I have nice breasts. See? Lucy, come on now. Take it from the top. And this time remember, it's night. She's cold. - I'm never gonna get it right. - Just keep at it. How long is it gonna take? Years! It's too hard. Lucy, you were so happy when you thought that you were going to be a real actress. I'm not happy now, so I give up. No. I decide, and you're not giving up. Now, come on. Take it from the top. Think about the words. Fuck! So you stayed out all night. That's great. - Thank you so much for coming. I'm so sorry. I'm not as stupid as you think I am, okay? Thank you so much for coming. - She will be missed. Thank you so much for coming. I know who he is, Madelyn. Thank you so much for coming. It was her time. - We have a time? Oh, yes. I believe that. That's nice for you. - I fucking know who he is. This is a blessing. - Really? She's out of her misery now. But... no more ice cream. Thank... Oh, Keith and, your wife. I didn't expect you. Of course you didn't, but I wouldn't have missed this for the world. Really? Oh, Madelyn, Madelyn. Oh, my goodness. Okay. If you need anything... anything, you have my number. Call me day or night. We... will do anything we can. But I'm sure what you most need right now is time with your husband. For this to happen to you now, of all times. But just remember, God doesn't give us any more than we can carry. Oh, God has some formula where he can calculate exactly how much pain to inflict on each individual? Isn't it interesting that things that are supposed to be mindlessly comforting are really, really horrible, you know, when you think about it? That's my Madelyn - no bullshit. I love it. Come on. Come on. Give me another hug. Come on. Take as much time off as you need. That doesn't mean we don't miss you at the office. We miss you so much. - Well... Speaking of 'no bullshit,' you know, everybody's mother dies. What is the big deal here? Lydia! Show some respect, for Christ's sake. The old lady's lying dead in that box over there. Thank you so much for coming. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Now, I'm sure Margaret's daughter would like to share some memories of her beloved mother. Madelyn? Would you like to say a few words? Well... I guess... I didnt realy have anything prepared. I keep expecting her to walk through the door and say, Hi. Hi! - Hi! What can I say? She's in a better place. Her time... has come. She lived a good life. Oh, ye are men of stones. Had I your eyes and tongues, I'd use them to crack... Heaven's vaults. She's gone forever. I know when one is dead and when one lives. She's dead... As earth. Keith always said you were very good at your job, but I didn't realize you were such a talker. Excuse me. I am so sorry. How are you? Are you okay? Is there anything I can do? - Yes. - Okey. Do you have the time to go someplace with me? - Yeah. Want to duck in the coatroom and have a quick go? Death, be not proud. No. I have another idea. You better come over. Hello. I'm just gonna pop out and, get some ice cream with... I don't know your name. Derek. Derek. - Derek. Derek, this is my husband, Paul. Husband? Paul. Derek. And you're... Madelyn. - Madelyn. I'm Keith. - Keith. - I'm Lydia. Lydia. I hope I don't have to remember all these. Nice to meet you all. - See you later. Is that the undertaker? - I don't think so. This is really good. Good ice cream. It is. It is. Oh, my God. I got to go. I'm gonna be late for rehearsal. I'm in a play. Wait, wait. What? You're an actress? No, no, no. I'm just... this is just something that my husband's girlfriend wanted me to do. Your husband's girlfriend wanted you to... It's not as bonkers as that sounds. Yes, it is. What's the play? King Lear. I play Lear. I've got to go. I'm sorry. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You can't just... Wait, wait, wait. You can't just walk off like that. You're starring in King Lear. You're one in a billion. If you only knew. Listen, if you're free, tomorrow night's my dad's funeral. It should be a rockin' good time. It should be. Will you join me? I don't think that I can. I just don't. I'm sorry. That's all right. I've been turned down by lesser women. I know what I want it to say on my grave! He slept with King Lear. So farewell to you both. - Prescribe not us our duties. Let your study be to content your lord who hath received you at fortune's alms. You have... Hi. Sorry I'm late. - No, no, no, no. I'm sick of people waltzing in here whenever they feel like it. You better have one hell of a good reason for being late. Well, what is it? You're wearing black. Let's hope somebody died. It's a tragedy, everybody dies. That's why I prefer comedies, happy endings. Kisses. We're waiting, Lucy. Oh, nuncle, court holy water indoors is so much better than this rainwater out of doors. Good nuncle, in ask thy daughter's forgiveness. Here's a night pities neither wise men nor fool. That's... That is a remarkable improvement. Damn, I'm such a good director. We should celebrate, go out to dinner. Today I ran into the stranger that I had drunk sex with. - Okey. My job is not yet done. I officially forbid you from seeing a guy you had sex with when you didn't know each other's names. One day it's the hottest sex you ever had, and the next day it's, you play the accordion! Really, it doesn't work. - That's what I thought. That's what you, we're starting to think alike? Isn't that great? Let me try it. Okay, so what would you say if I told you I really felt like calling Paul and asking him, Hey, how was your mother-in-law's funeral? You'd say... - Yes. - What? - Call him. Call him? - Yes. Call him. Funerals - that's the time when we start thinking about our own lives time slipping away, 'if only', 'if only'... wouldn't it be nice to finally know what's in his heart? Yeah, but I don't know. To me, it just seems... a little bit rude. Won't they be sharing snacks and memories about the dead lady? You'll know the truth. Don't you want to finally know the truth? Yeah. Do it. - Okay. Okay. He's not picking up. Hi. What do I say? What do you want to say to him? Yeah. Yeah, I'm here. Sorry. I'm just calling you... I just want you to know that I love you. What happened? He said, Jesus Christ. Leave me alone. I'm a married man. He loves his wife. Are you going to be all right? I'll be okay. All right! We've been through so much together, I forgot how we met. I'm not gonna kill myself when I just landed a juicy role. Shakespeare. And I think I can do a really good job at it. And I'll become a star. And he'll spend the rest of his life missing me. I'm okay. So, who was the man at the funeral, and what have you been doing with him for six hours? You're not quite yourself, are you? - That's true. I don't know that I owe anybody an explanation, but, for the record, that man's dad died the same night as my mother, and we got to... talking. And today I felt like he was the only one who understood what I was feeling. Oh, and how long has this been going on? Yes. You've been a busy girl. I swear I met him for the first time the night my mom died. I said that Madelyn wouldn't have sex with a man whose name she didn't know. She's no cheap slut, for Christ's sake. Wait, wait. So Lydia was right. He's not the one you've been sleeping with? What are you talking about? - You bet I'm right. Why are they even here? Hard to get rid of. You might think you're so smart, but we know everything. Oh, surely not. Yes. We do. The phone calls, the late nights that all started before your mother died. We said we'd keep it secret till we had proof, but I've had enough. We know you two are having an affair! No, we're not! I didn't even know she wanted an affair. - I... You should have told me. Though I know what you were up to. Oh, no. Wait. Listen, please. Can we just not get into all that? I buried my mother today. Yellow roses! On our credit card. Yes, I sent her flowers because her mother was dead, well, was dying. Right? Yes. Sure. Right. I told Keith that my mother was dying. You never told me that. Because you were busy being audited. So... The man at the funeral's dad died and and Keith sent me flowers because my mother was dying. Questions all answered? Great. Good night. - Wait. I have a question. I am so tired, Paul. Why can't you just leave me alone? Because I love you, and I want to know if our marriage can be saved. Ask your question. If it's not Keith and it's not the man at the funeral, who is it that calls you in the middle of the night? Do you really want to save this marriage? More than anything. Then let's talk in the morning. Lucy! Lucy! Oh, Paul, I missed you so much! - Stop it. Get off. How did you get her number? Huh? I was so careful. I didn't even tell you her name. What? - Did you look at my phone when I was sleeping? How dare you do that! What are you talking about? - I know what you've been doing, Lucy. You know about the play? - Oh, stop playing games. I know you've been calling my wife. Your wife? - Oh, come on! You might be an idiot, but I'm not. I checked her cell to see who's been calling her. What did I find, lucy? Huh? Your number! I've never called your wife. Again and again. When she's at work, in the middle of the night... In the middle of the... What's your wife's name? You know my wife is Madelyn Reed. Why else would you be calling her? But your last name is Jefferson. She uses her own name. Look, and will you stop trying to come up with some excuse? What? Like, you're just randomly calling some woman who happens to be my wife. Jesus! Why else would you be calling her countless fucking times? We're friends. Come on! Really. But I'm telling you the truth! - Oh, sure. Absolutely. You just happened by sheer chance to become best buddies with my wife. She must have seen us the day we had the fight. She said she followed me home, but she never, never told me she was your wife. We made a pact. She had to do whatever I told her, and I've been doing... Jesus. Okay, you have lost your mind. This is like some fucking fatal attraction here. Never call my wife again! You understand? And never call me or I'll phone the police. I'm gonna go home and just pray to God my wife forgives me. I'm sure she will. I mean, after all, she cheated on you, too... With that guy she met a couple of nights ago. She saw him again yesterday. What's his name? Oh, right. She doesn't know his name. You know about him? She tells me everything. She said she didn't have sex with him. And what did she tell you about her co-worker Keith? Keith? She said she didn't have sex with him either. Really? I can't believe you did that. Lovely home. You're gonna miss it. You do not play me like a game. Yeah, I cheated on you, Madelyn, but you know what? Now I realize why I took up with Lucy because deep down I sensed you were already cheating on me. What?! Don't give me any more of your lies! Lucy told me everything. Oh, everything? - Oh, yeah. And I'm not just talking about the stranger you had sex with, Madelyn. My god, you didn't even know his name! I know all about Keith, too. Keith? I know you've been sleeping with him for over a year. Yeah. Just hoping I'd have an affair so that you can get a better divorce settlement. Well, it's not gonna happen, Madelyn! Okay? I'm fighting you for everything! - Okay. Absolutely out of your mind. Here. There you go. I'll pack that. Take these. You can have someone to clean up after yourself, pack your pillow so you can snore all you want with Lucy! What do you mean, Madelyn's not coming? - Well, I'm not certain, but I'd be very surprised if she showed up. Is she ill? - No. Could you call her? - No. I'm not calling her. But we need our Lear. - Can't you find someone else? No, you can't just have anybody play Lear. We'll have to cancel the play. She seemed so reliable! What happened? Well, she's not even an actress. I'm the actress. I'm the one that has the right to be here. And frankly, she was here just for one reason, she had this scheme to distract me so I'd forget about the man I love. Would that be her husband? Yeah. - I thought so. Perhaps we could call her husband. Presumably, you have his number. He could tell us where she is. - No, he could not. He's living with me now. Now I understand. Are you sure that Madelyn is all right? If her husband left her today, for you, presumably she'd be upset. We've all read the tragedies. Oh, no! She wouldn't. I don't think so. - You don't think. Knock harder. - Do it again. - Is she hurt? I think we should call the police. Seriously? - Oh! Thank God. Come on. Thank god you're here. I don't know what we would have done if you hadn't been home. Are you all right? Of course. I'm fine. Well, when we heard what happened, we... It's just life. 50% of marriages end up in divorce. And everybody's mother dies. To tell you the truth, I'll be glad to get rid of this house. I swear I've spent the last 10 years doing housework. I just... Need a day to deal with it. Then you'll be at rehearsal tomorrow? No. I'm not doing the play. You can't quit! If you quit, they have to cancel. I don't know how much she's told you. Everything. Oh, well, then you know we can't be on the stage together. I can if she can. I'll get some coffee. You shouldn't be drinking alcohol is a depressant. Well, and if we have to choose, we'd rather get rid of Lucy than you. Definitely. Look, I know this isn't the best time, but I wouldn't ask you to do this if I didn't believe it was the best thing for you... I don't want to disappoint everybody, but... I'm exhausted. I mean, maybe if I was their age, you know... No, no. If you were their age, you wouldn't understand the part. Gielgud was a horrible Lear at 26. That's the best thing about being old. Look, you have learned so much more about life love never works out, we're all going to... die. So you can finally play the juicy roles. Well, men can. Please don't make us cancel it. I memorized all my lines! My grandmother's already paid for her plane ticket. It's only three weeks till opening night. Yeah, and the play will probably close after the first night. Yes. We've only sold 17 tickets. Look, I know this might mean nothing to you, but it's the best thing that's ever happened to me. Three weeks. Wonderful, wonderful! Look, you take today to do whatever it is that you need to do, and we'll see you tomorrow. I promise this is just what you need. Oh, I'm so happy. You get some sleep. Are you eating? You have to take care of yourself. And if you need anything, anything at all, you just let us know, all right? We did it! I can't believe it! It's so wonderful! You remember the day we met, you told me, If you give yourself a little time, an impulse will go away? Yes. Now go away. Oh. I'm sorry. I was... just a... waiting for someone I thought might... show up. Taxi dropped this off for you, sir. Thank you. Other way. Lion face. Mouse face. Lion face. Release the jaw. And shake it out. Shake it out. No, no, no. She's a C.E.O.'s daughter, not a hooker. All right, ladies and gentlemen. It's five minutes to places. Let's go out there and make magic tonight. Magic! No, just a little closer. that's my motivation. They look good. - You're making me really uncomfortable. Lear, Lear, Lear, Lear! Go, Shakespeare! It's time. Are you still worried about your acting abilities? I think you've proved that they're pretty good. Let's just get on with it, okay? Do you still love him? - Fuck off. Do you miss him? - Fuck off! We were married for a long time, Lucy. We shared each other's lives. My mother's gone, I'm about to lose my home, and the only thing that's gotten me through these last few weeks is this play, and we're just about to be laughed off the stage. So don't expect me to make you feel better, okay? It's all Madelyn this and Madelyn that. What? I knew he didn't love me. I just wanted to get back at you for tricking me. So let's hope you were right when you said I could do better. Tonight I'll tell him the truth. I'll tell him you never slept with that guy you work with. And I'll tell him you didn't sleep with the other one, too. I mean, only married people think one fuck matters anyway. We're starting! I get it... Why you would hate the woman who's trying to steal your husband. I get it. But then why... Why did you help me? Because I started to like you. Just remember, this entire play is resting on your shoulders. Now relax. The queen is coming. Go. Attend the lords of... of... France, Burgundy, Gloucester. - I shall, my liege. Meantime... Meantime, we shall express our darker purpose. Give me the map there. Know that we have divided in three our kingdom, and 'tis our fast intent to shake all cares and business from our age, conferring them on younger strengths while we, unburdened, crawl toward death. I did her wrong. Can't you tell me how an oyster make his shell? No. - Nor I neither, but I can tell you why a snail has a house. - Why? Why, to put her head in it, not to give it away to her daughters and leave her horns without a case. I shall forget my nature, so kind a mother. Be my cars ready? - Thy asses are gone about them. To take it again, perforce! Monster ingratitude! If thou were my fool, I'd have thee beaten... For being old before thy time. - How is that? Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise. You see me here, you Gods, an old woman, full of grief as age wretched in both. If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts against their mother, fool not to bear it tamely. Touch me with noble anger, and let not women's weapons, water drops, stain my cheeks. No, you unnatural hags, I will have such revenges on you both that all the world shall... I will do such things, yet I know not what I will do, but they shall be the terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep? No. I'll not weep. I have full cause of weeping. But this heart shall break into a hundred thousand pieces or ere I'll weep. Singe my head! Auntie, court holy water indoors is much better than this rainwater out of doors. And that all-shaking thunder, strike. Here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool. With a heigh-ho, the wind and the rain must make content with his fortunes fit, for the rain, it raineth every day. Never, never. Never, never. Do you see this? Look upon her. Look her lips. Look there. Look there. There. Bravo! Bravo! Let's do another one.
