Thank you, Mother. Why the gloomy face? Go have fun. Amulet for Long Life Why "Long Life", Mom? Brother, good luck! - Toshi... - Bother. Good luck! Thus I left my hometown way down in Oita Prefecture to attend university in Tokyo. I chose Tokyo because I had a dream. That dream was... to live in a trendy apartment and lead a trendy life. See you later. But above all... to become a trendy singer, just like Kenji Ozawa or Cornelius... to make my debut as a serious yet trendy pop star. Everyone's so trendy. That was my real dream. We share a class I see you smile and I love you so You melt my heart Negishi-kun, you're such a good singer. I hope I'm as good as you some day. Don't embarrass me... It sounds pompous but I hope my music gives someone the power to dream. To dream through music? Right. In other words, someone with "no music, no dream". That's so cool. It's like no music, no life, right? That's close enough. Amazing... You could definitely turn pro if you wanted. Pro? New Musicians Wanted No Music, No Dream But after graduating... the band I end up playing with... He's here! It's Sir Krauser! I'm a terrorist from hell! I raped my mom last night I'll do my dad tomorrow I'm a terrorist! No parents 'cause I killed them both Nor friends or girl 'cause I killed them all Kill them all, kill everyone! Murder, murder everyone! Murder, murder everyone! Paint all memory red with blood! That's right. We're the Satanic metal band, "DMC". Detroit Metal City. How did it come to this? Where did I go wrong? It totally sucks! It's Krauser's legendary tooth-guitar! This isn't the music I wanted to play. And not in this kind of band. Not this kind of band at all, Mom! Death Metal is a species of Heavy Metal with a sound informed by themes of "Death", "The Devil" and "Hell" etc. Bursting like a comet into this world of Death Metal came the band, Detroit Metal City. The bizarre sound of DMC Back Stage - No Entry Thank god that's over. I'm Johannes Krauser II... or Soichi Negishi. Krauser, your vocals were superb tonight. He's bass vocalist Jagi, a.k.a. Wada-kun. The band's whole identity rests on your shoulders. Nishida, you should practice more. This is our drummer, Camus, a.k.a. Nishida-kun. Which reminds me, Nishida, Can you return that PS game I lent you a while back? That "Summer Holiday" one? Why do you always ignore me? You do remember? Don't tell me you lost it? Negishi, hurry up with a new song. Let's have a big hit and become a major player. Then get on TV and do big tours and stuff... That'd be good. Forget it. We share no interests, we're total opposites really... we were forced into a band before we knew what was going on... thanks to this boss from hell. You rocked tonight. I danced 'til I was wet down there. Fuck Crazy Guys! DMC Boss, so kind of you to come! Another packed house. Tons of advance sales on next week's new single. Keep it up and we'll blow everyone away. We're soooo grateful. Bloomers... Then DMC will rule the world of death metal! We're soooo grateful. More bloomers... Death metal... yuck. You got a problem, Negishi? As I've told you lots of times this is the kind of thing I'd rather sing from now on: It's called "Raspberry Kiss". Your message said let's go the beach Just us two Wearing matching shirts We'll have such a fun time FUCK OFF! That won't get me wet. I've been in Tokyo 5 years. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Show us the real you! Sir Krauser! I hurt my mouth on the guitar. Damn groupies... Get lost, jerk! No-one would believe I'm in the band. Excuse me, coming through... The instant he was born, Sir Krauser sent his mom to hell. He's truly evil. What? My Mom is still alive. I sent carnations for Mother's Day. A letter, too. He's responsible for all drugs in the world. He holds the record for raping 11 chicks in 1 minute. He's the king! What are they talking about? I don't even smoke... and I'm still a virgin. We'll have such a fun time You beg me for a kiss Just like I knew you would I want to sing about a world full of dreams In which a boy meets a lovely girl One day I'll be understood. One day... for sure. We came to sing on the beach Even god would sing along While the dolphins watch and smile Must want cockies to eat. Merci... Thank you for always listening. Even her CD jacket is so trendy. Wish I could put out something like this. Negishi-kun? - It is you. - Aikawa-san. It's been ages. First time since graduation, right? Meeting you here of all places... You still like that singer? I edit a magazine now. Really? I read it every month. I love that "Caf Music" column. I write that. - Really? - Yes. What do you do these days? Hmmm... I... Diehard fans. Oh, our second single comes out today. Disgusting CD jacket. I never said that, either... What's the matter? Nothing. What would she think if she knew? But I want to tell her the truth! You know, actually... Isn't this band horrible? Parden? I can't bear to listen to it. And their look... it's just so not trendy. Not trendy... Sorry, maybe you like this band? No way. They're so tacky. This jerk's got "kill" on his face. Just a sec. Hello? Where the hell are you? The store event's gonna begin. Damn... already? I'll be there. Aikawa-san... I'm late for work. I'll be an hour. Shall I wait? Would you? I got a date with her. Hurry and get ready. I'll see her at the end of the gig. Today DMC fans are packed in like it's a real concert. Shut your mouth, you bitch! Do you wanna die? Shut the hell up! Aikawa-san will be my inspiration. Tell me about your second single? Sir Krauser? Don't rush me, you fat pig. I'll kill you all! I got splashed with evil water. How lucky! Plans for a new album this year? Bitch, are you ordering me about? It's time to meet her. I got carried away talking... My next question... I just remembered a fiendish errand in hell. See how he mocks the Capitalist pigs. Makeup remover... Aikawa-san. Negishi-kun. Have you grown? I've been working out recently. Yep, bulking up nicely. I see. I'll be right back. Sorry. He's back! I just had some chick on the banks of the River Styx. The River Styx... how perfect. All hail his twisted desires. He's still out-of-breath! Sorry, I'm so busy... What's with those boots? And your face, it's white... I guess working out is firming up the face muscles... Oops, I need to go back to hell. To hell? Rape. At last... his 10 rapes-per-second declaration. I'm Krauser over here... Choco-rape cake... And myself in the caf... What's your favorite food? Flesh Panacotta. Eat mine, too! At the event, I'm Krauser... and myself at the caf... Devil Carved Signatures Krauser at the event... At the caf, I'm Krauser... Damn, I'm totally confused! Hey you pigs... Bare your lower halves for the Demon King. Sir Krauser! Rape all women Sell off all the female swine I do it whenever I want to I'm a raping machine; the Demon King I gave birth to all evil All evil bows down before me the Demon King. What a noise... Wonder where Negishi-kun works? Let's go. Keep going, keep going. Huh? That's Aikawa-san? Why is she here? I mustn't go that way. My wig's slipping. If she spots me, it's game-over. I'm doomed... she'll hate me. It'll be the end of everything. Behold, a real pig's arse! See that chick! You're horrid! Aikawa-san... What the hell have I done? Wasting our fateful reunion... Life sucks... It sucks... I'm scared... Avert your eyes. It sucks, it sucks... Hello? Negishi-kun? I'm glad your old number still works, Something upset me so I left early. Thanks for seeing me despite your work. It made me happy. You haven't changed a bit. If you'd like... there's a store in Daikanyama you'd love. Shall we go? In Daikanyama? I'll go. Definitely. I'd love to. I didn't blow it. Hooray! Death Records I saw it, Negishi. First time a newspaper article got me wet down there. Violence to women during autograph session. Stuff of legend is just what the band needs. Well done for that. I'm soooo grateful. Another superb Negishi performance. I was just trying to distract her... Now the band's one step closer to Jack. Who's Jack? You play death metal but you don't know Jack II Dark? It's hot! Jack II Dark, the emperor of black metal, a legend in American magazine. He survives in the darkest time, and the rest of time again, through drugs, sexual brutality and assault brutality. His performances were violent and death-related. There are following fans like so many moths to the flame. Fuckingham Palace. The King's anphant. A smash of rest of youths, who were tired of existing sound, He changed the world's metal music, forever. When I was young, his records turned me on to metal. DMC's roots go back to him. Who'd want their root in a scary guy like that? I want to eat bloomers. Anyhow, it was great publicity. Keep up the good work, making legends churning out songs. Certainly. Right, buddy? Not me. I want trendy music that makes people dream... Jesus Christ. Don't be so full of yourself, you bastard! Krauser, get more crazy. Give your body and soul over to violence. Don't hurt me. Before long, you'll out-do Jack as a Monster of Metal. Wait, Negishi... Let him go. This is the only life he has. He just isn't aware of his genius yet. Leave him to me. It's so wonderful. Before my very eyes, the first time since joining DMC, that trendy lifestyle I'd almost given up on. What's up? Wait a minute... I keep coming up with great phrases... So you kept up the music after all. Love does provide the energy to create music, after all. Sell off all the female swine Let's just keep it secret, huh? Yuri-chan, right? I'm glad you came by again. He's one of the greats of the Tokyo trendy scene... designer, Hidetaka Asato. Honored to meet you... This is a shirt you designed exclusively for a magazine. Is that right? It really suits you. Praise... from the top. This store you designed, it's lovely. Really? I'm doing a jazz-bar next. And a limited edition pastry for convenience stores. Try my drinkable rice-bowl. Wow, you even create that? Negishi-kun wants to be a musician. I'm just starting out... That's not true. He's really good. Let's have a taste. Sing in my performance space. Great. I haven't heard you for ages. If Asato-san likes my music here... maybe he'll become my producer and I'll be on the road to success with my beloved pop music! I wrote this song thinking of this lovely girl I know. Please take a listen to My Sweet Love. I wake up one morning You're baking a cheese tart... This is kinda crap. My sweet baby My true love - Negishi... is it? - Yes. If you're just being frivolous, take it out on the street. Frivolous? Negishi-kun? Goddamn it! What does he mean "frivolous"? Being trendy doesn't mean he can criticize my music. Maybe that's her. Coming. Hey, Negishi... Boss? I've come to change your life. Shoes off, please. Shoes... Hey! Shit! Such a cramped place. You shouldn't be short of cash. Why the dogs? Mick and Mack. And I ask my friends Not to smoke in here. Hot! To stifle that voice of dissent, I'm going to school you in death metal from the roots up. Please don't. I'll make tea, then please leave. I'm grateful to you and all... but death metal is just... Is apple tea okay? OH YES! This is it. Life is metal! Boss, please stop! FUCK! Choosing this decor took me ages. It's a text from Mom. Son, are you well? No news from you recently. You must be busy at the flower shop. Not my new designer shirt! My alphabetized CD's... Your boss at the flower shop sounds like a kind person. I bet you're still pursuing your beloved dream of music. Knowing you, looking trendy, too. Please, don't hurt me. Awful clothes, too. Things must be tough in Tokyo. Do try to find a nice girl. Don't kill me. I'm still a virgin. Aikawa-san? Disgusting. Just be the gentle boy I raised. Take care of yourself. From Mommy. Shit... How dare he... Love doesn't provide the energy to create music... Animosity does... and hatred... Do I turn the other cheek? This bitterness... am I to put it aside? Am I to disregard my own wrath? I shall punish you for your crimes I'm a messenger from hell I shall tear you limb-from-limb Am I to put aside my wrath? Am I to put aside my wrath? I shall tear you limb-from-limb Am I to put aside my wrath? He did it. Put Aside My Wrath? Why no DMC straw dolls? Sold out. We're waiting on more. Why don't you have 'em? You'll wish you were never born. Their 3rd single "Put Aside My Wrath?" on sale today. An evil influence not for the ears of children And so, totally contrary to my wishes DMC was thrust increasingly into the spotlight. No.3: "Put Aside My Wrath?" - DMC Gross. Japan's music scene was abuzz with DMC. Before we knew it, we were part of the "Warring Indie Bands" event. Yo, check it, Shibuya. They call me Kiva I'm like the divine Shiva An MC back from NYC I'm gonna make this DMC hysteria into history, ya' History Kiva-san's special freestyle rap... Rhyming fatso! You say you're an "MC"? I say you're more like an M&M. I'll blow your fat-ass away. Back from New York, I'm the real deal. You're a fake-up behind make-up, ya' fker. You're a larger Maharaja no bull would ever charge 'ya. Not a Bat phone, you got a Fat phone. So far below me, you might have to blow me. Your gags make me gag. Nice gag! Sir Krauser's Death Rap Rhymes win the day! This is dedicated to a crap band diss-ing women and obsessed with rape, those loser, virgin, mama's boys, DMC! We're just bunch of virgin, cherry boys Getting make-up from our moms Begging dad to buy us clothes Crush 'em, crush 'em all Crush 'em by the balls Castrate 'em, castrate 'em all Castrate 'em, castrate 'em all Castrate 'em, castrate 'em all Loser, virgin, mama's boys, DMC? That's pretty good. Don't laugh. It's about time to jump. Jump? I wasn't told about that. Jerk. The Boss arranged to have us arrive in style. I'm soooo grateful. I won't go. Shut up. Hurry. Sir Krauser is dead! No, he's not. It's a castration-fantasy extreme masochist routine! ...help me... What an awesome guy... Jack II Dark, the legendary of American metal music, has decided to retire. The rumor has it... Jack's retiring? ...the injury of 32 people last year in Grand Canal, is probably the reason of Jack's decision to retire. We would never know the exact reason yet. But, before his retirement, He will go on a world tour, to beat the all metal bands in the world. A world tour? Since she saw me like that I didn't dare call Aikawa-san. She hasn't called me either. Makes sense, after what she witnessed. Right, Merci? Don't you run, too. What's wrong? What a lovely song. That's the first time I saw you in my dream. Since then, we became to be lovers. Sally, we all know... That's young Saji, my lower-classman at university. Aikawa-san. Negishi-kun? Don't get me wrong. That... that was my landlady. Your landlady? Right. My really scary landlady. If rent's late she always bullies me like that. Is that right? Then I'm sorry I didn't help. What a relief. Right now, I'm doing magazine research about this popular band, Tetrapod Melon Tea. Tetrapod Melon Tea? Amazing that Saji-kun came this far, huh? He's so cute!! This song, "Sally, My Love" is out on our own CD label. We're doing a gig soon. Your own label... how cool. - Please shake my hand. - No problem. They've got so many fans... In my interview, Saji-kun said his inspiration is No Music, No Dream. That's... Unable to forget your words in college he formed a band. - Saji-kun remembered what I said? - I do, too. You're the reason I started work at this magazine, too. Really? Are you free on Saturday? I'm playing solo here again. Asato-san invited me out... Asato-san? To go to an amusement park. It's kind of work-related... Should I go? I guess so... Really? You don't mind... I get it. See ya. Losing ground in music to a junior from college. Losing in love to a fashion icon. Maybe I'll re-design this place. Redo the ghost train in Chrome Hearts? Wow... If you did, they'd get more customers for sure. Suppose so. How come I'm such a loser? Stalking her on a date. Design a roller-coaster, even... Damn, he's flirting with her. Wonderful. Upper-classman Aikawa? Saji-kun, what's up? Someone you know? It's the indie band I did the article about. Nice to meet you. We're Tetrapod Melon Tea. Hun? Damn. Wait. Please, wait. Stop... Upper-classman Negishi, wait. I can't wait. If she saw me stalking her on a date, there'd be trouble. I'm sure he came in here... God, this thing's hot. Sorry, you're waiting? It's okay. Why so spooky, all of a sudden? It's... Sir Krauser, right? How do you know me? Of course I do... I'm a musician, too. I've always respected DMC's unique sound. Where did my friend go? It's nearly time... I'm so nervous. Why nervous? I'm about to start a gig. That kind of nervous... Sing for me, then. Sing and it'll calm your nerves. Thank you for the advice. I first met you in my dreams We've been lovers ever since It's not too bad at all. I knew all along, Sally That one day we'd meet Nice tambourine work. Let's slip away, Sally It's only 7pm in Tokyo Forget the time, come over, Sally I'll be waiting here, Sally Forget the time, come over, Sally I'll be waiting here, Sally Thank you very much. Saji-kun, Hurry, it's time. Sorry. Sir Krauser, you remind me of a much-respected upper-classman. I felt so relaxed with you. I am the devil. Don't get too close. As if anyone would have respect for me. Saji-kun's succeeding in the world of music like I wanted. On the other hand... There's me... dressed up like this... Saji-kun's there! I'm so envious of you, Saji-kun. Isn't that Hidetaka Asato? What a trendy couple. Sorry to interrupt earlier. Maybe I'll become your producer. Isn't that great, Saji-kun? I'm delighted. - I'll get in touch. - Please do. - Let's go. - See you, guys. Mom, it's that weirdo again. Quiet, dear. Bastard. How dare he? It's Sir Krauser. Like a couple of rutting pigs! Sir Krauser, thanks for... Nice tambourine work. Cry as you like, no-one can save you now. Wait! Fighters for justice, "Victory Three" will save the day. Shall we watch the monster show? Monster show? Just sit. Hey, Yuri-chan... Will you be my girlfriend? I'm sorry, Asato-san... Don't tell me you prefer that Negishi jerk? With my producer skills, I'd soon make you forget that hick. Victor Three are so strong! Who's that guy? Where are they? Wow, he looks really tough. Why is Sir Krauser here? Help, Red Hero! I work part-time here so I can go to all DMC's concerts. Did my fervor, summon him from the depths of hell? I'll take him down. Red hero's gonna help him. Don't you touch him. Or I'll tear you apart! Help! You bastard... What's up with this? Let's go. Wait right there. Hey, that's taking frivolous too far. Frivolous? There it is! The Headbanger's Headbutt! For Chrissakes! Behind your make-up and costume you're just a weakling. With your horrid songs about rape and killing. Just a coward whining about his frustrations with the world. Music is about giving people the power to dream. The love of my life once told me that. Without music, there's no dream. How come you only sing those kind of songs? I never wanted this... I had dreams of my own... Stop... Stop! Negishi-kun? Goodbye to my dreams... Goodbye to DMC. Jack II Dark, has finally decided to retire. And he's now on the road. The world-wide tour is titled: World's Collapse Are you really wanting to retire after this tour? Knocking down all metal bands is your focus, what is your rival? Jack, is it Hell Davi in Norway? Or Porwason in France? The Detroit Metal City. How come?? His rumored return to the underworld is true. Sir Krauser... Personal matters dictate that I must resign. Please don't look for me. Negishi. FUCK Excuse me? You're the landlady, right? Well... Please tell me where he went. I haven't heard from him. Where on earth is he? As if I know. He abandoned his dream and fled. Abandoned his dream? He was a genius. He could've been a hero if he'd accepted his talent. A hero has a mission... to give people the power to dream. Despite that... ...the fucking fool fled. I'm home, Shigemi. Be... be... You've grown so much. Shigemi... I'm back for good. That whole dream of music was never going to work. My dear boy... Mother. It's a surprise to have you back out of the blue. Why are you wearing that? What's wrong? I bet you've been worried... Let's talk later. Hurry indoors. That shirt's only for sale at our gigs or online... Why? What on earth's going on? What's that sound I know so well? You old goat! How dare you wear my DMC shirt out in the damn yard? Take it off before you stretch it. Bitch, I wring your neck. Toshi's a total DMC convert... Toshi, don't talk to Ma like that. Is it okay to have your hair that color? What about your dickhead haircut? It's a "mushroom" cut, actually. The song's ending... Toshi-kun? He's been like this recently. Won't go to school. Won't help around the farm. Is that right... My music even got my own family in a muddle. Unknown Number? Hello? You little punk, I'll meet you in the back yard. Who's there? Where are you? Who was it on the phone? Come on out. I'll tear you apart! You little prick... Think you can tear me apart? Sir Krauser... why are you here? Tonight is the full moon. I was summoned from hell by you. Wow... You don't help around the farm, nor go to school, either. Yes, to be like you, Sir Krauser. I dropped school and all that domestic crap. You idiot! Caring for the beasts is to learn to command power... as every ruler must. Shigemi's so shy... yet she doesn't mind him. Cutting the grass a useful skill when it's time to cut men's throats. He's so good at that... Learning to drive a tractor... vital for when it's time to car-jack and steal. Wow... just like a true farmer's boy. Also... I studied all the way to college. A good ruler must prepare himself with a knowledge of all disciplines. Is that right... I should relearn the basics again. That's good. Toshi feels bad now. Oh, Toshi-kun... Is this a friend of yours? Mr. Johannes Krauser II, from down under. Australia? So far away. I mustn't let Mom see me like this. Will you stay the night? You like my mom's fried eggplant that much? It's a feast. Honor your parents. Yes. That's your older brother? He's a jerk... dickhead haircut... Fool! That style is purposely obscene. Only for those at the highest ranks of death metal. Is that right? Let's all take a photo together. Good idea. Where's Soichi? The gate to hell's closing... curfew... What a shame... Has he gone? I don't think they noticed. Hi... I'm back from my walk. That's so cool. It really looks like a dick-head. What are you talking about? You missed the photo with Mr. Krauser. You've got a delivery from your friend. Today, the long-awaited face-off between DMC and Jack II Dark. DMC, representing Japan's metal scene yet still awaiting Krauser's return from the under world... From Wada-kun... Dear Mr. Negishi, my dream is to be on TV and chat with famous hosts. That's abrupt. Like a letter to Santa Claus. Without you, I'd have become just an MC in a karaoke bar. Nishida would be in jail for some kind of perversion. So we need you back here. DMC is our dream come true. Just as it is for the Boss and all our fans. Come back in time for the contest. We're all waiting. Sincerely yours, Wada. Wada-kun... Nishida-kun... Summer Holiday Game Boss... No music, no dream. Japan is already yours. Please defeat Jack and rule the world. Our hopes are pinned on DMC. You must defeat Jack. I owe my life to Sir Krauser. DMC's music lets me dream. A new album, I beg you. Please promise you'll return. These can't be real... My dear, what's the matter? Oh, nothing... Are these Mr. Krauser's? I guess he left them here. Shall we go for a walk? I've never seen Toshi so happy. Mr. Krauser really is a good person. That's hardly likely. A good person wouldn't wear that make-up nor sing those terrible songs. Mr. Krauser makes people dream with those songs. - Dream? - Of course. But... Dreams don't turn into anything in the end... They're good for nothing. Dreams just set you up for disappointment. Dreams are fine. They cost nothing. It's true that life can be harsh and not everyone's dream comes true. But every single person is free to dream all he wants. Dreams are amazing. A dream can supply courage and the power to move forward. In the depths of disappointment, a dream can shine a light in your heart. No matter what you look like nor how you say it, if you help someone dream, you're amazing. That's what I think, anyway. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Lovely weather. - It really is. - May I have this? - That'll be 500 yen. May all Soichi's dreams come true. Mother... Mother. I must go back. Really... If you bump into Mr. Krauser in Tokyo, kindly give him this. Huh? Take care. Just as music gave me the power to dream I'm now able to give others the power to dream. The dream... ...only I can provide. - He's been spotted! - What? Tahat's it! Someone witnessed him in the driving seat of a bullet train. Sir Krauser is back among us mortals! Let's go. Where are you going? World Collapse I'm off to do some research. It's Sir Krauser! Sir Krauser! We're heading to the venue. We'll escort you there. Sir Krauser. This way, sir. Sir Krauser, over here. Sir Krauser. I had no idea metal was so popular. The dream... ...only I can provide. - Jagi! - Sir Krauser's not there. Please come to us, Krauser. Gimme my bloomers back. Straight into "Fkingham Palace". Jack... amazing as ever. Here it comes. Is it time for the beast? It's the Metal Buffalo. Beat him! This is dangerous. Jagi will get gored. Go get him. The Metal Buffalo. Krauser! I ascend from hell where I dug a grave to bury an old fool called Jack. Since when did he write in English? He must mean business. He's going to scrap with the King. DMC will never survive this. Kill him! Be... be... Sir Krauser commands the beast. Jesus Christ, Krauser you know how to bring it. Next, I shall pacify you. FUCk! NO! He's stealing Jack's trademark curse. You still went behind me years! He'll never keep pace with Jack! Sir Krauser's raiding fkingham Palace. He pronounces "Fk" so well. Idiot. No way Krauser could sing that classic. How dare you say that? Neither of them will back down. Not taking a breath... neither of 'em afraid to die. Sir Krauser, breathe or you'll die. Can Sir Krauser keep up with Jack? Damn! He doesn't know when to give up. What happened? - Where's Jack? - Sir Krauser? What's happened? Sir Krauser! Maybe, they're dead? What? Sir Krauser is beyond killing. It was a heck of an explosion. What you say is blasphemy. Krauser? That's enough, Sir Krauser. He's right. We've seen enough. You showed us the dream. Sir Krauser! - Thank you, DMC. - Thank you. Everyone's dream... All of our dreams... Of course, my own dream, too... I was so helpless after all unable to make anything come true. Go To DMC Go To DMC Go To DMC Go To DMC Go To DMC Go To DMC Get up. Sir Krauser! Make my dream come true. Dream... Negishi-kun... Go To DMC Go To DMC Go To DMC Go To DMC Go To DMC Where I belong, after all... ...is right here. No Music, No Dream... No Music, No Dream... No Music, No Dream... No Music, No Dream... No Music, No Dream... FK Oh! Yes. Sir Krauser is re-born! Superb, Krauser... Bloomers... Watch out! Take it. Then depand on you. YES I DO It's like a dream. DMC beating Jack... Now's the time to give them the sound I love. Now, sing. It's the performance of your dreams. Here it comes... It's "Murder"! I wake up one morning You're baking a cheese tart My sweet baby. That's you. This song... it's Negishi-kun! You're my love A new song? Let's head out to the trendy part of town Cheese tart in one hand, You skipping by my side What the hell is it? So sweet, I'm going to puke. A devil's love song, huh? Sir Krauser wants to punish us further. Listen. We must endure the devilish murmuring. Sweet lovers. Sweet, sweet, sweet L-o-v-e-r-s FK OFF! It's hot. This won't make me wet! FK! I'm a terrorist from hell! I raped my mom last night Negishi-kun. Excuse me. I'm a terrorist from hell! No parents 'cause I killed them both Nor friends or girl 'cause I killed them all Kill them all, kill everyone! Negishi-kun. Murder, murder everyone! Paint all memory red with blood! Murder, murder everyone! Murder, murder everyone! Paint the future red with blood! Kill them all, kill everyone! Murder, murder everyone! You're Negishi, right? Who is Negishi? Strip the female swine. - Chicks - Negishi-kun, you're horrid! I'm a terrorist from hell! I raped my mom last night I'll do my dad tomorrow I'm a terrorist! No parents 'cause I killed them both Nor friends or girl 'cause I killed them all Kill them all, kill everyone! Murder, murder everyone! Murder, murder everyone! Paint all memory red with blood! Murder, murder everyone! Paint all memory red with blood! Kill them all, kill everyone! Murder, murder everyone! Murder, murder everyone! Paint all memory red with blood! Murder, murder everyone! Sir Krauser, I got that indecent haircut!
