Welcome to the first stage of ...our Quit Smoking Programme... K Wake up... Wake up my son... In this lab... ...its our responsibility... ...that your habit of smoking, which is making you irresponsible... ...finish that off completely. If we fail to deliver... ...and are unsuccessful in treating you, ...then we have no option left, ...but to send you down the road no sane person would walk on... Would anybody like? No... Because my son, soul-full the body is divine... soul-less its dead The end... Soul... The inner soul... ...is often frivolous, debauch, indulgent... but with a strong mind you can control it... ...but if you are inherently weak then my son... ...the wandering soul has to be released, let go... The soul is pure, When life comes into being... ...then slowly, bit by bit it starts to erode... ...the body corrupts it, by indulging it... ...and to rebuild that lost eroded soul is why I have been appointed... By whom? By The Greater than the Greatest! Gurudev Baba Bengali! But! - Don't Argue!! Democracy is up above the ground you walk on! you die on! You can "butt" into anything with your butt's, up there... But here you have descended... ...from your material hell into my lower depths... Here my spoken word is the gospel of the gods... Now that you've signed on the contract... ...would you care to repeat the honours... This is my cheque book! Yes sir. Fees for your own treatment! And an additional one rupee... which is my fee But that we take in cash The fees for making me quit smoking is 21 LAKH! It's back-breaking work, you know. You think I'm crazy? You think I earn my money only to dole it out as charity Repeating it again & again won't make it 20... ...it will stay 21 only... If a poor man comes to you for help... ...you charge him 21 lakhs too? The "Poor" qualifies for a government subsidy This is robbery, you understand! See, my fee is just a measly buck That too a token of your appreciation I haven't started this business for money. Its all for charity And just you watch! The money you've parted with will be utilized in your own treatment Do you know that how much of your money... ...you've squandered away due to this bloody habit... Yes... my lord... K... K! K! Touch of violence please! Ok my lord... The first time... ...Abbas stuck a cigarette between ...your fingers just so you could look at it you procured the matches from your own pocket... ...a matchbox back then set you back by 50 paise... ...all the gas you burnt up commuting to and from the cigarette shop... ...the mouth freshener that you purchased ...to hide the stench from your father... ...then you graduated to pot... ...and once after smoking some spurious weed ...you nearly went up in smoke yourself! A mere visit to the hospital cost you ...1,50,000 to aspirate the sludge from your stomach... ...every ashtray... matchbox, lighter, bidi... ...and those fat ones Cigars. Every wheeze, sputter and cough caused by smoking... ...every spoonful of glycodine, phensydyl ...every pill strepsil, Erithromycin, Augmentin... ...every illness brought on by this habit of yours... ...all those occasions when... ...your partner requested you to butt your cigarette out... ...but you suspended the meeting and strode out to finish your smoke... ...the losses you incurred because of that! Your wife's illness. You bear a thirty percent stake in your brother's asthma trouble... ...a silk Chinese tie estimated at forty thousand burnt... ...mattresses set afire on four disparate occasions... ...all because of a lit cigarette Now excluding the millions in losses... ...you have spent a total of If you don't step on the brakes now you'll be spending ...as much more in the next seven years To help you shake off the yoke of this burden... ...the treatment is in your hands Give him a pen - Yes sir And what if I don't sign it? If you don't do it now then you have to do it later What if I don't do it? Answer to your what is a complicated process ...my son... you can't expect me to be prompt. I am going - Guruji... But you have signed a contract I haven't! You forced me to! Do you know who I am? Why K? Where K? That I don't know. But who K! That I surely do know! I am going. Your wish, I treat patient's and not torment them. What's the way out from here? That's why I keep repeating son, Sign on it and... All the doors will open up for you. Otherwise I will be forced to do what I don't want to do. The only problem with such a quick second trip to that black hole is... ...you may not last the third. That's why just sign for now You can stop payment later Did you sign? Give him a pen, please! Now my one rupee please which I take in cash?... Don't have it Ok. Next time. Does it look like I'm coming back? It's good if you don't come! But son, everyone comes back. In my experience each one returns... Unfortunately smoking is such a pathetic habit... Now come over here... You come here! Come on son. Your treatment has begun. Come And if I don't? If you don't come? Then how will you go? From this moment onward you will not smoke... Not even going to touch it... And if you do then for the first one that you light... ...we'll have your brother... ...pay us a little visit from his hospital bed... ...do you know what this is? Once upon a time lived a man called Hitler... He had a teeny weenie moustache like that Charlie of Chaplin... See that. My good friend, Hitler This was his stroke of genius the Gas Chamber And the lady there, she is your doctor's mother... ...and the smoke... ...its the cigarette smoke... ...all the thousands of cigarettes... ...you must have smoked up until now all that smoke in this little room... ...for your brother to breathe in for all of five minutes. Enough to make the healthiest of lungs burst... ...and I believe your brother is just one lung-ed. And if your resolve still doesn't hold up and you light up again! Please sir, just listen to me, I swear I swear to god almighty I'll never He scripts with just one finger now Salam Namaste, M.B.B.S. Listen Maqbool, I am there for you. And if you light a third one... ...son before you smoke it make sure... ...you take one last long loving look at your wife... ...because in all likelihood you'll never see her again... ...and if your itch drives you to light up a fourth time then... ...it's the gas chamber for your brother... ...if he survives the last onslaught... ...and if he doesn't then your mother... remember to give her a warm farewell hug before you light that one... ...and despite all of the above if... ...you still intend to be as obstinate as a mule. Then the mightiest of kings have been rendered helpless... ...before the stubbornness of a child. Smoke the fifth with all the lung power you've got. No one will get in the way No! Nope! Nobody will stop you Because son Soul-Full, the body is divine... Soul- Less, its dead. You can go to the police station You can try to fight us. You can do whatever you want to... ...but you can't smoke. Have fun... I shall leave now. Let's go You're absolutely insane. I didn't come here to sign any contract I don't want to quit smoking What will you do? You can't do this to me! Come with me Where? You can't do this to me Let's go Go where? - Who are you?

Back there when I ran away to Sir Castro's beautiful Cuba! Once there I booked myself in a room in a three star hotel. "How lucky can one guy be..." "I kissed her, she kissed me..." First day, I lay down on my bed. - "Everything all set..." The hotel was a three star... ...two of which were shining through my roof... I stood up on the bed. And stuck a finger each in both the holes My fingers weren't thick enough I looked down. Saw two cigars in an ashtray I picked them up and shoved them into the holes... Then I got into the cigar business! But soon enough, Smoking was banned! What do I do now? I was wondering when... Sarah said "Let's go to India!" But I was lost! What would I do in India? I swear I had no idea my fate matched Newton's The cigar from one of the holes fell on my head And I thought... What I used to do in Cuba... Why not do that in India! Now every Indian can have the opportunity to blow on... ...a In-fidel... that's castrated... With the spelling mistake. And now ladies and gentleman and friends!
