My name is Youssouf. I will see to it that you get electricity. Hey, this way! Come, I'll show you the apartment. Will I have my own bedroom? The faucet for hot and cold water are reversed. I don't know. We'll see about it later. But it doesn't matter. You'll need some drapes. Is this all you have? No furniture? Maybe you'll find some in the basement. Is anybody there? Over here, it's housekeeping. Your job. People come to get their mail here. We can't use the mailboxes because of stealing. You'll have to sort the mail. All right? Do you understand, yes?

Ask him if the water is OK. - Is the water OK? - Cmo? - Can we drink the water? - Of course, this is your home. These buildings are A, B, C, D and those over there E, F, G, H. E, F, G, H were under construction but they're finished now. Anyway, you'll only deal with A, B, C and D. The others, not your problem.

The milk, the honey, the sugar and the lentils... these foods I offer to you, Oh, God with the elephant head, pure as diamonds... give me the Tamil of the three Sangam. Oh, God Ganesh... keep us safe... and help us so everything will be all right here. Come and eat. Here. Take a spoon. You can eat with your fingers. Tomorrow, at school, she'll need to eat with a spoon. I can't find my school pouch. Go to bed. Do you have a pillow? You're a girl. You don't need one. I'll sleep over there. Move further. He's the new housekeeper and she's Illayaal. Does she speak a little french? A little. Did she go to school in Sri Lanka? No? Why? - It burned down. - Your school? It burned down? Why did it burn down? What does she say? Who burned down the school? - How do you say government? - Government. The government? The government burned down the school? OK. She'll join the UP2A. It's a special class so she can learn french. Do you understand? It's a special class. Do you have any more questions? They ask about a lot. Who burn down the school, why, how?. Everybody burn down schools. Why do you say that? I don't want to! I want to stay with you! Don't leave me! Look at me. The three of us have a secret. I don't want to go. Don't forget it. We, the grownups, have to work. And you have to go to school and learn french. You need to speak the language with the other children. Otherwise, we'll have to go back to Sri Lanka. Do you want to go back there? Do you? Me neither. Look at me. Are you going back to school? Get up. Let's go, let's go. Zaoui. Building B. Z. Samir Ben Cherif S. Take these, try it. Sort them. Harek.

They take their mail and that's it. And then? What do I say to them? What do you want to say? Good day. Thank you. I'm the housekeeper. You introduce yourself, you act nice and that's it. Dheepan! I'm here. - Come! - Why? Come, quickly! What is it? My name is Aziz, I live in Building A, upstairs. I'm Mourad, from B. It's all right, she got the names mixed up. She thought she had to sort by first name, not surname. Here, for example: B for Bouchenak. You understand? Ben Sherif. If you didn't know, why did you ask me to do it? Let them talk. Do you understand them? What are they going to think of me? Shut up! Don't fight, it's not worth it. We'll teach you. C, Certaoui, it's my apartment. What is it? She's crying. It's OK. She's tired.

What do you think you're doing? I, housekeeper. Cleaning. Do you live here? You can't come in, we're not finished. Come back later. After, later. Don't stand there, take off! - Good morning, madam. - Good morning, sir. I can't do everything myself. It's as if I have to take care of two children. Couldn't you work? Isn't this work? Get a job, make some money. When I go out, people stare at me. We're new here, it's normal that people stare. We'll get used to it. Around here, many women cover their heads. You could do the same. Head cover, it's not my religion. I'm not talking about religion, but trying to look like the others. And stop getting upset every time I say something. How are you doing? I found her a job. It's an elderly man, he's a little ill but he's OK. She has to cook and do the cleaning. He lives in Building G, 9th floor. It's for an older gentleman in Building G. Cooking and cleaning. - Youssouf, how much do they pay? - 500 euros monthly. It's good pay. How much? It's a lot, but pretend is sufficient. 500 euros. 500 euros? What did I say? Say yes and that's it. - So, then? - She doesn't speak french. That's no problem. Who'll look after Illayaal? - Can our daughter go with her? - No, she can't. No children. I'll take care of her. - What do you say? - Yes. 500? Are you trying to figure it out in rupees? - In one month... - 500 multiplied by 170... 85,000? - Who's she? - The housekeeper's wife. Show me your purse. Where are you? Youssouf? - Mr. Habib, how are you? - Good morning. She's your new... Mr. Habib, is Karine here? Karine! - Good morning. - Good morning. - She will take your place. - I'll take her. Here's the bathroom. Here, the bedroom. You have to clean it. The kitchen. He eats here. Over there is the cleaning stuff. I'll show the living room door. When they're here you can knock if you need anything. And they'll tell you to come in. Do you understand? Knock on the door... Come in. Is Mr. Habib OK? Yes. He just finished eating. - Who are these guys? - I don't know, they're like the ones downstairs. What do they do with the old man? They lock themselves up in the living room. They talk, like it is their office. - Who are they? - Crooks. Gangs? Like the Vannilas and the Minnals? Something like that, but less dangerous. Youssouf says that it's normal around here. - Can I play with you? - No! One, two, three... No! Did this also happen in Sri Lanka? I'm sorry. "They are my friends to the end" "Without my friends, I'd be lost." "Without my friends, no..." What does it mean? It's a poem. About friendship. Without my friends..., you're a fool. Without my friends..., you're shit. Without my friends..., you know nothing. Without my friends..., you don't understand anything. Without my friends..., I don't want you. Without my friends..., you're ugly. Without my friends..., you're shit. Are you making fun of me, eh? Who do you think you are? I don't want to see you! Get out! I hate you! I hate you! My mother is dead. I don't have a mother anymore. You could at least treat me decently. I don't know how to deal with children. I know nothing about children! Di you have children in Sri Lanka? Brothers, sisters? Two younger brothers. Did you get along with them? Yes. Then, do the same with me. In January, government forces were involved in a small conflict zone, killing thousands of Tamil civilians. Independent reporters and observers were not allowed to reach the combat zone. Rumours circulated that atrocities were committed. It was a war without witnesses. It least, it's what we initially thought. We now know that a soldier had a mobile phone and today, 8 months later, his recordings were found. Come in. Is there some more left? It's very good. Do you understand Chinese now? I'm sorry. Take this. Can you bring some more water? This is a little too spicy for the old man. - How are you, Brahim? - All right! What about you? - It's so good to be free, right? - Of course! - It's nicer outside, isn't it? - Yes! Listen, if you see Tifa, tell him to come up! How do you feel living here with your husband? You, happy here? Yes. Were are you from? India, Pakistn? Sri Lanka. - Where is that? - Eh... India, here... Sri Lanka, eh... here. - It's like India. - No, it's below India. Forget it. - Want a drag? - No. Looks like your husband is doing good work. He's doing good. Thank you. If you need anything, help you tell me. Or if Youssouf is bothering you too much. All right. I'm leaving. I'll leave this for the meal. What you cook is very tasty. Thank you. Turn it on! - What? - Turn it on! - OK! - Push the button! - Done! Push the button! Any floor! Shit. Can I ask you a question? Do you think people here are funny? I don't know. Why? Sometimes, they say thing and laugh. I understand all the words but they don't sound funny. It has nothing to do with the language. What is it, then? It has to do with humor. French humor? Just humor. You're not funny. Even in Tamil, you're not funny. Ever? What? This, it's OK. What? That we talk like this, it's good. We're not from Pr. We're from Sermaise, Marcheval. We get paid by the day. To hide the junk, protect and secure the business. They prefer to hire people from the outside, that are not connected to those living here. If you live here and know all the people, you're likely to talk or hear something. In the end, they screw you. But if you're from other parts, you don't give a shit about their lives. You get your dough and apply the rules. You don't relax. Still, it's a shit job. - Do you want to eat? - Yes, of course. Can you serve it here, please? Yes. Thanks. - Are you finished? - Yes. - The old man sleeping? - Yes. Are you leaving? Do you like football? I don't mind. Don't stand there, sit down. Sit down. What's that? Nothing. It's an ankle monitor. - To race? - No. - Actually, it's so you don't run. - Oh? Why? Thanks to this gizmo, people can keep track of me. My name is Illayaal. I live in France. I like to dance. - Good evening. - Good evening. It's your turn now. My name is Dheepan. What are you doing? It's funny... it feels like being in a movie theater. Do you see that dog? I know it. Do I take everything? No, just this. First, we go to temple. And then? Hi! Did you take everything? The rolls... the rolls. You were telling me about Shoban. He's in Dortmund now. Can you get his number? Did you find Ravi? The one in Dortmund. I can get Shoban's number through Ravi. It's my brother, have you seen him? Two for 5 euros. How are you, Dheepan? What's new with you? You know... the Greeks would chop the heads off of those who came bearing bad news. Colonel Chern is there. He wants to see you. - Is he alone? - Yes. Wait here. He's there. Be careful. Relax. - Are you OK? - Yes. Do you want some water? Tell him to come in. Come in! Sivadhasan! It's been so long. How are you? I'm happy to see you. They told me they had decapitated you, that they had identified you. I have an important mission. To raise money. I am in contact with the Lebanese. They want 100,000 dollars for the weapons. Do our people here continue to support the cause? What do you want weapons for, Colonel? To send them home! What home? To the comrades! Colonel... it's over. I lost my section in Nandhikadal. My wife died. My children are dead. The was is over. What are you saying? Repeat it! Is OK, Colonel. The war is not over. But for me... it's over. Your breath stinks. How are you? What happened? Are you sure you're alright? Why did you sleep with us? I have no idea. Did you have a nightmare. I've been living here for 30 years. Before that, my father was around but they caught him. They almost caught my uncle. I'm next on the list. Sometimes, I get up and think: this has to stop. But, what are going to do? Do you understand what I'm saying? Do you understand just a little? A lot? Nothing? It doesn't matter. What about you, anything to tell? Do you have anything to share? What do I know? Your daughter, your husband? Daughter. You can tell me, I don't understand anything. She's not my daughter. And he's not my husband either. It's all a charade. What does it mean when you do...? This? Is it a yes or a no? Or go to hell? Back in Sri Lanka when you fall, you smile. When you get hurt, you smile. Here if you smile too much people think that you don't understand or that you're making fun of them. How are you?. The weather is nice today. It's ideal for a couple. It's 22 karat gold. You can appreciate the fine finish. - How much is it? - 7,000. 7,000 euros. - Both of them? - Yes. I also have some a little less expensive. - Rubies, emeralds. - How much? 5,000. - How much? - 5,000. What are you looking for, exactly? I'll think about it. Do we know her or not? Ready? - Espinach. - Espinach. - Es-pi-na-ch. - Espinach. Potatoes. Potatoes. - Potatoes. - Potatoes. Stop, you son of a bitch! Go to your room! - Why are you doing this? - Shut up! Go to your room! Are you asleep? What are you doing? - I'm leaving. - Where to? To England. To my cousin's. I called her. We came here to waiting for our documents. I never thought there would be shootings. Don't you remember anything? It's not the same. Why not? Because over there, it was you shooting? Whose is this? How did you get your passport? What do you think? What can you do to stop me? I'll go anyway! I'll go to England. I'm the housekeeper. Wait, can I check your purse? - Don't frisk her. - What? Don't frisk my wife, please. Stay out of it. I'm not your wife. Go ahead, frisk me. - Go ahead! - I told you, don't frisk her. What are you doing? Damn bastard! What's happening? Are you fooling around, guys? Let him go. She's the housekeepers wife. Come on, relax. Stop fussing, I don't give a shit if he's the housekeeper! - Do your job. - Let them through. - I'm gonna fuck up that housekeeper. - Don't say that. We're gonna kill you! What's wrong with you? Let me go or I'll scream! Would you leave Illayaal behind? Yes. Can you abandon her? What did you think? You finally ended believing the whole fairytale? You think I'm her mother? You think that she thinks I'm her mother? You're not my husband, Dheepan. I'm not your wife. And she's not our daughter. Speak. Say something! What? I won't move out of here. Hey, housekeeper! Do you think this is a football field? What are you doing, sir? You could make a highway for all I care! What happened, the curry didn't agree with you? This damn son of a bitch! Open up, you bastard! Open up, son of a bitch! Block it! Let's go, help me. - Don't shoot! - What's that bastard saying? Here... don't shoot. Son of a bitch! We're gonna kill you, you'll see. The school master want you to sign this. What is it? It's for an appointment. What for? She wants me to join the regular class. Come and eat. What are you doing? I'll be back in five minutes. Is this you new army? What's your plan? Are you going to train them? Are you going to buy weapons? Do you have everything? Yes. Have a nice day. You too. - How are you? - OK. Why do you no longer work at Mr. Habib's? I don't want to work in his house. He needs you. I don't like working there. OK, listen. Brahim ask me to take you to him. He wants to talk to you. Come in. Why aren't you coming anymore? Do I frighten you? You know, I'm only a businessman. Chaos doesn't suit me. The frisking, the concrete barriers, the elevator, I didn't even know. They told me. But your husband has to stop with this business in hall D and the white line. Or I'm gonna have to kill him. Did you go to see him? No. Youssouf came for me. Why you? Because he knows me. Why didn't he tell me? What are you going to do? Why are you involving us in this? Us who? An undesirable threatens to kill me and you react like this? You don't even blink? - It's for your... - Shut up! What do you want? Why are you touching me? I'm sorry. Why do you react like this? I don't want to! I don't want to. "Demons and wonders." Winds and tides. Far away the sea retreats. Demons and wonders. Winds and tides. And you, algae softly caressed by the wind, in the sands of the bed, stir while dreaming. Demons and wonders. Winds and tides. "Far away the sea retreats." Take off your coat. Can I go to Yasmine's birthday? Ask you father. Dheepan? What are you doing? When are you coming back? I don't know. I saw the passport and the money. Thanks. I'm going to call my cousin. I'll be going to England with Illayaal in the summer. I'll notify the school. Come back. I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch! Hi. Yes? I just had a talk with Farid. We need somebody here! Where's everybody? Are they all on holidays? Tell them to come up. Right. Mr. Habib is finished. Do you want to eat? No. Shit! I... wanted to tell you... my husband is not a bad fellow. He's a good man. It's... the war that... affected him. Don't hurt him. Has everybody decided to break my balls today? - You want tea? - Yes. Forget it. It's all right, you can go. Help me. We have to get out of here. Quick! Help me. Stay, please. Please... call your husband. Calm down, tell me what's happening. Who's gonna kill you? Where are you now? Where are you? Hey, get out of here! I don't want to see anybody here! Get out! Housekeeper. I don't give a shit! Get out! Housekeeper. Let's go, damn itfind him! Don't move! Where are you? Where is he? He's dead. It's me. Look at me! All this blood... Are you wounded? It's you blood.
