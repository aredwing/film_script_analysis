Always. Show me how much you love me. Come on, girls! Hands off cocks... into your socks! The food's awful here, but if you convert to Islam, besides finding the prophet Mohammed, praise be upon him, you also get special halal dinners brought in during Ramadan. - Are you a Muslim? - Nah. But don't think about converting unless you're willing to go pray. - Them brothers'll still fuck you up. - Kill you for not praying? Maybe not kill, but they can handle themselves. Ever seen anyone get killed? Boys have taken their own life, but you couldn't get away with killing anyone. You sure about that? At least not in the wing, or in the gym, or in the yard, or at canteen. No, you'd have to do it in a cell or in the showers. - You know Mason? - Yeah. - Essay? - Yeah, I know that man. What about Jake? Mind out, cuz. What, do you know me, fam? Have I got your girl's knickers on my head or something? - Why are you looking at me? - You heard him, you fucking wanker.

I Yeah, Nash and Jake are tight. You see that man giving screwface to Jake? That's your man Mason. I Flow like a goal, let me roll I Wanna get it down but you never can show I If you wanna do it then you know we can blow I I'm independent but you never can show I Let me hit 'em up, let me stick 'em up with the gun I Let me see how I want it, go and get the fun If you wanna do it, come and get the runner I Wanna get it done but you know you ain't a gunner... i MTV, ain't it, yeah?

Told you that shit was strong, now, didn't I? - Home time now, boy! - I ain't got no home. So... Jake. Er, you were arrested for being carried by a motor vehicle taken without consent, and resisting arrest. When's your trial? Jake, you understand that if you're found guilty, It'll be a custodial sentence, which would be your eighth sentence. Do you have any supportive family who could help you at this time? None at all? Supportive? I ain't got no fucking family! I ain't got no dad! And I ain't got no mum! She never cared about me! She never cared when her boyfriend used to torture me! Till I had to put a stop to that myself! So, if you want to class that as supportive, go ahead and write that down on your little sheet of paper. - Jake, I'm just trying to help you. - You're too kind, man. There are things that you could do. You could enrol on a training scheme, a basic literacy programme. Like you said, I'm going jail, innit? But you have to make a change to your life, put in some effort. This is long, man. And I'm fed up of this shit, you know. Divvy bitch! - Night, Elise! - Night! - She's fucking up the peace, bruv! - Hello, princess. - Shut up. - Where've you been? You're late. - You been busy with these dickheads. - They're in process, you're on license! - Fuck the process! - Fine! I'll just call the police, shall I? - I'll fucking kill you, man! - Hey! You're on CCTV, dickhead! Oh, fucking hell, man! Hey, you just got yourself sent to jail, you donut! '... a raid at this jewellers where armed robbers took advantage 'of police being called to rioting and looting across the capital, 'and stole watches said to be worth thousands of pounds, 'including this rare white diamond Daytona. 'Police are appealing for information on the smash-and-grab 'that is now a murder investigation, 'after the shopkeeper received a fatal gunshot wound. ' Come. Come. What are you talking about? Are you mad? Tommy. I'm gonna sort it out now, bruv. She ain't gonna talk, man. She ain't got nothing on us. Why complicate things? Why you acting all confused. com? It was you that made us get pulled over by feds in a stolen car! If this probation officer decides to grass on us, we're all getting life. It's your turn to get your hands dirty now. Tom, it's me.

Who's got the remote? - What the fuck are you trying to do? - Shake on it, bruv. Double or nothing. - Double or nothing. - You're gonna die. Let's do this right now. Right now! There you go. There you go, there you go. - What you saying, bruv? - I hear you're a salesman of sorts. I don't talk in riddles. What you want? I need a bit of crack. - Can't you see I'm playing pool, bruv? - I'll come by your cell later, yeah? Come see me in the morning. I ain't got nothing till then. Hey, fuck off! Ah, fucking book boy.

Tommy? - Elise? - Tommy! - Elise? - Tommy, the baby? Shh. It's okay. It's okay, Elise. Who did this to you? He slapped me. He must've come back. What's his name? It was the others, Tommy. They did that robbery, I know they did. They were wearing the watches. They must've thought I'd give evidence or something, I don't know. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. What are their names? I want to rest. Big man likes to smash up a five-month pregnant woman. I don't need to fucking prove that to you! - I don't need to hit bitches. - You were all caught in a stolen car. Yeah. Yeah, I was in the car. I ain't denying that. I didn't know it was stolen. Where did you hide the bikes? Where's the fucking guns? She knew something. That's why you tried to kill her. Keep talking about guns and bikes and a robbery that I don't have a fucking clue about. All I know, you got me in a moody whip. Other than that, go suck your mum. Well, you're going to prison. It got out of hand. You didn't expect the shop owner to be there. You are a murderer! I was at home with my baby mother! She can verify that! How do you explain being in a stolen car one hour after the robbery with your boys? They come pick me up, innit? So we could get some ice cream. Innit? Right. You were seen hanging around outside her office. - So what? It's my probation office. - Look... You went back to put her in her place. No, I fucking went back to apologise. Are you dumb? Didn't have you down as one for apologising. You know what? Have you even got any fucking evidence? You'll do six months for affray. Six months? Six months for affray? Fucking six... But I did it on the fucking toilet seat, bruv! You listening? Fucking prick, man. Nurse! Nurse! Hey, it's all right, baby. It's all right. We need an IV right now! What's wrong? - Get off! - Outside, please. Outside! Fucking come on! This is for life. Do you hear me, brother? Let's do this. Repeat after me. - Takbir! - Allahu akbar! You're now a Muslim. Brother, your sins have been forgiven. This is a fresh start, a new book. Embrace the brothers. Come. Part of the family now. Salaam alaikum. How are you, brother? Yeah, all right. - What are you in here for? - Assault. - In the riots? - No, no, some other thing. Well, I find in a moment of anger follows a thousand nights of sorrow. Yeah, that's more true than you know. - Well, we're all sinners in here. - Yeah, some more than others. The best of sinners are the ones who repent, you know? And the door of repentance is always open to you. This is my brother in Islam, Ali. This is my brother Mason, who's just found the path. What, you're a Muslim, yeah? Hamdu lillah. You're here to repent your sins, is it? - A man's sins are his own business. - Is that a fact? Salaam alaikum. Brother? Peace be upon you. Mason. Allahu akbar. - You fucking attacked her, didn't you? - You what? You fucking attacked your probation officer! Fuck you, I only slapped her! - I'm gonna fucking take your life! - I swear! I heard about her getting roughed up. The feds already asked me about it. Why am I gonna attack my own probation officer? That was my girl. Wait. Wait, wait. It was Jake. It was Jake. They did the smash-and-grab. They did the smash-and-grab, she was gonna tell the feds. Jake killed some guy. He's not gonna tell you about that. He's only in here for car theft. I didn't have nothing to do with it. I swear to you. I wouldn't have nothing to do with that attack. Elise, you're gonna have to say something. Elise? - Please... - Don't! Don't. Don't. Elise, please. Please just look at me. How can you want me now I'm like this? I love you. Hey. I love you. I can't have children, Tommy! - All I want is you. - That's not true. - Yeah, it is, Elise. - It's not. All I want is you. You've given me everything I want. Hey. You've given me everything I want. You should've been there, Tommy. I did it, bro. Had a little ask-about. So where are they? They were sent to Gravesmere Young Offenders. So that at least narrows down where they are right now. - For how long? - Knowing them, it's gonna be long. - What's this about, bruv? - Forget it, man. I've got to go, man. 'What's going on?' 'Everything we had has gone. ' Please don't go. There's nothing left. Elise, wait. Elise, please... Elise, please! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! You were asking who's Jake, who's Mason, who's Essay. Well, I've just seen Essay being carried out in a blood bag. As I hear it, he'll spend his license in health care. Was that you? It was, wasn't it? What are you after? Like I said, justice. So, you'll work your way through all the gangsters? Hey, yo, cuz. Come. Come, man. Have a seat, cuz. You want a coffee, fam? - Yeah, go on. - Angel, make him a coffee. Grow, cuz.

So, cuz, word on my wing is, you know something about Essay getting wrapped up, hm? Don't worry, cuz. He weren't on my team. No, you done me a nice little favour doing that there. I was gonna have to stab up that lanky prick for trying to take my package anyway. So what happened between you two, then? - Think he must have fell. - Yeah? Yeah, yeah, hard. Why's his face gone red for? I think it's the weed, bruv. Red boy. You know that's a white man thing, innit? You know black man don't get embarrassed? Hey, don't worry, cuz.

Got the pussy laying half dead down in the block now. What's this got to do with me? Seeing as we're out of here in a couple weeks, you go see the probation officer and finish this job off properly. Remember we got a murder on the out, you know? So, you want another on your hands? - Are you serious? - Man, I'm out. I told you I'm done with that. Now you're sticking your arse in the air five times a day, that makes shit different between me and you? Let me make this clear, you're with me.

Where are we going now? Ooh, where do we go? Cos if it's the same as yesterday, you know I'm out Just so you know I Because, because... Our paths, they cross... I You're an animal, Nash! What's good for the goose is good for the gander, sir. Try and fire me, and you'll be driving a bus this time next week. - You just threatened me, Nash? - Course not. You're in charge, sir. All happened on your watch. So, we got rogue individual or complete institutional failure, eh? Can't wait to see what the Inspectorate make of it. I want these boys back in the wing! Everybody likes a tidy shop. So, let's get it together, okay? This stays an internal matter. I From cradle to grave From ashes to ashes, from dust to dust I Because, because... I Our paths, they crossed I Yesterday was hard... I There's something that you gotta know. What? What, do you think I attacked your girl? Jake told you to do it. Look, it weren't me, brother. Look, I ain't no snitch, but the reason me and Jake don't speak no more is because I told him he went too far with that. What, so you're saying he did it? I feel partly responsible, but yes... that is what I'm saying. Why should I believe you? Cos Jake's got it in his head that your girl's gonna talk and get him put away for life. Why are you telling me this now? Cos he wants me to finish the job as soon as we get out. - What? - He's threatening my daughter! I can't have that. But I can't be killing nobody. You gotta go see him. You gotta be prepared, brother. You gotta fix this mess, be it how you fix it with your girl, or how you fix it with Jake, cos I just know my daughter doesn't deserve to be involved in this. She's lovely. More than I first saw her. You listen to this lot, rapping at night? At least they can dream. "If you can dream, "And not make dreams your master. "If you can think, And not make thoughts your aim. "If you can meet with triumph And with disaster "And treat those two impostors Just the same... " Rudyard Kipling. And here we are. Boys raised by wolves... ...getting ready to fight the tiger. Harry, this ain't about revenge no more. He's going after her when he gets out. I can't let that happen again. I need you to help me. Now, Harry. Shit food! Overcrowded cells! Suicides every week! Corrupt, this place is inhumane! Shame on the people who put us in here! - Get down! - They treat us like animals! Is it any wonder that we act like animals? We all deserve better! We all deserve better! Red boy! There you are! Huh? Come on, then! I told you I was built for this life, eh? Crawling round the floor like a dying little pig! You're just fucking... All fucked up, huh? Just like your bird. So now I'm gonna do you just like I'm gonna do that pretty little bitch when I get out of here! You know I'm gonna play with her for a long time before I kill her. That's not gonna happen! I This world is going up in flames I And nobody wanna take the blame I Don't tell me how to live my life When you never felt the pain... ... they don't hear me cry, ooh I They don't hear me chime, ooh They don't hear me cry I So what I'm gonna do? I... and nobody wanna take the blame Is it you? Or you? I Oh, no... I
