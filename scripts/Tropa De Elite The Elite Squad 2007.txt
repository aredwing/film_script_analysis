Here we don't take it easy, neither to DRE Even the BOPE got scared shitless to come up here. We dont take it easy with the armies, civil PD or MPD. I have respect of all my hood. But Dende hills is also land of God. In God we trust! DJ! Come on! Rio de Janeiro got over than 700 slums. Most of them taken over by gangsters armed to teeth. Fellas carrying AR15, pistol Uzi, HK, and so on. In all over the world those weapons are used to make war, In Rio, they are for the crime. A 762's shot transpass a car like a piece of paper. It's silly to think that in Rio the cops go to the slums only to keep the law. Cops got family, bro. They also have fear of death. -Which way? -The alley here! It's because of that that cops must decide between... to be corrupt, to distance of or just join the war. Most people don't like war. And Major Oliveira wasn't an exception Every friday he used to go to the slums to collect the 'arrego', which is the money that corrupt cops get ... to take it easy with the traffic. -Wake up, Marcinho! -Go ahead, Sinistro? -Keep an eye, cuz the 'pigs' are coming That's cool, Bihope! Let them come in as well! The gangsters fight too but they also want their bread. Why fight against the cops since they can make deal? But, that night... there was an officer who wasn't there for the money. That was Officer Fabio He was forced to go and he was scared shitless If Fabio wasn't in that mobile Neither Neto and Matias wouldn't be there. Neto and Matias would never distance of, or become corrupt. They were honest. -Cheers! -Did they drop off the mobile? -Can you see Fabio? -No worry! It's a joy to come today. -What the hell? -Go, go, fuck sake! Can you see Fabio there? -I'll deal with that! -What's going on? -Hold on, dude! -Whas' up, Oliveira! It's true that the peace in Rio depends on a fragile balance. Between the ammo of the gangsters and the corruption of the cops. Honesty doesn't play the game. -What's the story? - I'll deal with that, bro! God damn it! Did you see Fabio? -Hold a sec, dude! -What's going on? It's a stable balance that could be broken by the smallest breeze and... on that friday night there was a strong wind in Babilonia. It was the night that Neto and Matias decided to go to war. Fuck! Who you shot? -Come on. Lets go! Damn it! What the fuck is that? - There's 2 'pigs' around. Who you shot? Follow me! -Come with me, damn it! Fuck! -Damn it, Marcinho, hurry up! -Hurry up, Marcinho! -Fuck, the 2 'pigs' are coming. -Fuck you, bastard. -Fuck you! -Bollocks! -Move! Move! Damn it! Hey guy, we're gonna die! -We're gonna die! Don't stop shooting! -Fuck! Fuck sake! We're gonna die! - No way, brother! I am gonna die! -Fuck! - I am low on my ammo! Patience, take it easy, that's all we need! We gonna get there, make our job, taking it easy, right? There will be a big crowd cuz of the ballroom. We will go very slow there, there might be injuried cops! Slow down! If Rio depends only on the conventional police the dealers would have been taken over easily. That's the reason the BOPE was formed. The Elite Squad of the Military Police. -Who of you guys has been in 'Babilonia'? -I did, 'Zero-one'. - You will take the front! -Beside the main road. To the right! In theory, the BOPE is just part of the Police System. In fact, it's a completely different police system. The BOPE's logo shows exactly what happens every time we go to the slums. And we don't use blue uniform. We use black one. -Hey, This is BOPE! Nobody moves! -You behave yourself and stay quiet here! -Behave yourself! The BOPE was formed to interven when the conventional police can't deal with the situation. When it comes about Rio, this always happens. -'Stab the skull, no money at all'! My name is Captain Nascimento. I controlled the BOPE's Alpha team. It's been a long time since I first joined that war. And I was starting to feel sick of it. Elite Squad is hard nuts to crack, It beats one, It beats all, so It will beat you too! My darling, I wish I was there too, But I gotta work. Can I hear his heartbeat? Show me! My, It's strong, isn't it? Very fast! Listen, I gotta go cuz I am at work. No worries cuz I put it on the microwave when I get there. Alright. The only way to finish the war in this city is to disarm the gangsters. - He's on target, Captain! That's why the main priority of the BOPE is not to arrest the gangsters, But to get the guns. -What's up Pompeu? Got the pieces? -Yep. - Here they are. - OK! In my time, the MPD had 30.000 officers, bad trained, bad paid, and loaded. BOPE had only 100 cops. Damn it, I want to blow their assholes heads up! Which one, Captain? -Those scumbags of MPD. For each gun that we apprehend there was 3 new more coming. 'Zero-fourteen', let them do the business cuz Renan will deal with them later on. I lost my counts of how many times I worked the nightshift because of the corrupt cops. 'Zero-one', this can kill two birds with one... Is it 100%, 'Fourteen'? -'Skull', Captain. So, fire in the shit hole! -For me,those who support gangsters are accomplices of them. Yea, Dude, I have to say that I was just about to blow up! And my life was sink or swim. -Good morning. -Good morning, darling. -Let me take this. -Hey, darling, I set the table for you -Take your seat. - I gotta leave, darling. -I have to get earlier in the batallion. -Damn it! You got late at home yesterday and you are already leaving! -I had a shit sleep today. -Is the baby ok? -Of course he's not! -I'm always waiting, he feels the same too. -He didn't put pounds last time. -What do you want me to do? Quit job? -If I knew that you wouldn't quit I'd never become pregnant! The war has its price. And when the price goes very high it's time to get out of it. -Goodbye. -Hey darling, take a piece of bread... If you just watch time goes by You may loose your last chance to get out of it alive. I was searching for a substitute. But it's not that simple to become a Captain of BOPE. And to find someone who's honest, brave, with mind and heart of policeman to stay on my position it was almost impossible. -Capt. Fabio, maintenance supervisor and Chief of the first regiment. -Capt. Oliveira, Chief of the third session of the Major State. And take 3 years of studies To join the corporation First day of job is frustrating. But along the time Most of rookies get disappointed -rookie, you are welcome. -Keep in mind that up to now you are in probatory job. And you will be checked by me and Major State I want you to know that these officers team which I have the honour to lead it's a big family and the best of the corporation. -Estevao, Take the rookies to their duties. By that time I didn't know Matias and Neto. I hadn't any idea that I could need The intelligence of one and the heart of the other. If I could put It all together, the story would have been different. It wouldn't have been hard to quit BOPE. But who said that life is easy? -That's the place you gonna start, rookie. -This is the car repair place? -Yep, why? Is that any problem? -Could you put me in another station? I don't know nothing about cars. -Listen, we have 46 cars and working properly. -Captain! -At ease. -Those two fellas are your assistants. -Alright. -249, will be on the streets until the end of the day like I promised, Sir. -About time, Tiao! -Captain, but the new pieces didn't come yet. I'm finishing the clutch of the one here. -It is a brand new one. What's the problem with the windows? -Windshield, I know, but, I recycled engine, clutch... -Shut up, I don't want to know about this shit anymore. This is the rookie's business now. -rookie. -Lieutenant -Relax, enjoy it there's ham sandwich, some coffee, chilled water... -I am not hungry! You start work immediately cuz I want to get the car until the end of the day! -But we don't have pieces. -You'd better talk to the Captain. -Anyway, No jokes and start work. Cus I don't want to stay here for all day. Move! -Sir?! -Drop that bread now! Come on! -I don't care, you better work now! Neto was an impulsive guy who used to do it before think On the other hands, Matias used to think a lot before do it. Do you see that pile of papers? Each page is a register of a murder that MPD couldn't avoid. That would be just rubbish in Neto's hands. That would be just statistics in Matias hands. -rookies, Matias will work with you by now. -How are you? -Those fellas are your assistants Officer Bruno Officer Machado -Your job is to look after the radio operations And register the occurrences. OK? -Yes, sir. -Your desk is right there. -Yes, sir. -Sorry sir. -Any problem just call me. Have a nice job. None of both could be compared to me. But one of them would have to replace me. -Alright, class. Well, here they are, the 10 books that you're gonna use... Matias was intelligent and dedicated. much chances in life. Groups of four people. -Then you gonna choose one of these -Hurry guys, I want to do the Foucalt, right? -So do I. -3 of us. And Matias had the chance to join the best College of Law in Rio. For him, law studies had everything to do with Officer job. For him, officers and lawyers got the same mission in life. To keep the law. -No, no, I'm gonna bring it back this way. Nobody will notice it. -So, let's join a group. -He won't notice. -What you mean? -He won't notice, Beta! I'm sure of that. -Is this the sociology class? -What's your name? -Andre. -Last name? -Andre Matias, why? -You are in our Foucalt's group, ok? -What you talkin bout it? -I'll tell you in a min. Matias ideals were in a Right World, far from Rio's reality. -Hey, I'm Maria. -Nice to meet you. -This is Dudu, Roberta, we will do the Foucalt. To join the BOPE, the fellas must sink or swim -We're gonna do the Foucalt. Matias still had a lot to learn. -This Fella is coming to Rio -Do you know who I am talking bout it? He's gonna stay in Archbishop's place. in Turano slum. And we must keep him safely. -No way! -Turano is at war, and the Pope wants to stay there?! -I book a room for him in Copacabana. I've tried to change that. But not even God can do it -He will stay there anyway! -We have 3 months to bring peace to Turano. -Sorry Sir, but that's not possible. Do you agree with constant raids? -We're going under the shootings, without the unexpected element Someone will gonna die. -Nascimento! -That must be done and the raids start tomorrow. -Am I clear? -Yes Sir. -Dismissed. -I know that the Pope doesn't have nothing to do with my problems. But he's been to Rio twice already Couldn't he know how things work down here? Surely no politicians want to see the Pope being shot. If the Pope wants to stay close to a slum, what does a Mayor could do about that? Take the risk of a stray bullet hits The Sanctity's head? No way. They might call BOPE -Gods sake, Beto, stop! -I am at studies. -You'd better stop study so! Let's get a fresh air. -Will you use the car tomorrow? -Why are you asking? -I'm going to Prazeres slum -Are you nuts? -What the hell you gonna do in a slum? -My class mates arranged a meeting there. -You are a cop. You cannot go to slums, they kill you there. Find another way! -Relax! Nobody knows that I am a cop. -Be careful! The Pope needed the BOPE. The BOPE needed me. And I needed someone to replace me. It wouldn't be easy. I'd have to do the raids because of the Pope. But I would be armed, Dude. And dressed in black. The problem for a cop that join a college is that at first sight the classmates are nice guys and there's a lot of chicks with bad intentions. -What's up? -Thanks for coming. -Nice to meet you. -That's Rose. That's Helena. He's gorgeous. -You naughty girl, Rose! -We need this, look! -Don't stare at me! -Sorry to make you come here. But we have lots to do. Alright? -Ok. -This is the administration office. This is Rodrigues. who is helping with the NGO And represents the sponsors of our community and is also a big friend of mine. -Do you have vote for Senator already? -No. -Now you got it! That is Magalhaes. Take more for your friends. his number is 451, don't forget, five minus four equals one. I must admit that at the first sight is hard to resist. Rich students like to help poor children And who doesn't care about them? -Romerito, this is Andre. -How is it going? -Fine. -Maria, can we go to the arcades games? -I can't make it today, I got job to do. -How about you? No homework? -Yes, I have, but I ll do it later. Who said to me that will study, huh? Matias was a naive boy And had a sweet heart. It was natural that he could get involved -Does he have problems in school? -Yes, he does. -Did you ever check what could be behind that? -He just refuse to study. -Maybe there is something wrong. But there's a limit of involvement that cops cannot pass (-well guys) He should have known how to break the involvements when it's time too. -I saw that. -And Falcaut is the word for criminal law in power descriptions And in fact doesn't have any social contract. -Did you get it? Besides that -The state always deal with 'instititions', hard word, isn't it? Institutions To control and punish the criminals. Did you get it? like the Cumo de Plata hills, in that prison of I have to admit that... -I'm stoned! they have mixed. For Foucalt, the historical analysis of those institutions, reveal the state... -Hey you Andre! -No thanks, Roberta! I don't enjoy it! -Pick it! -No, no, thanks. -Relax. -This is exactly what our teacher has asked us. -This shit is so good. -This is cool. Awesome! -Good stuff. If the guy is carefree he ends up being seduced by his mates. The right thing to be done was to caught them and arrest them under the code 12 of the 6368 law Officers must keep the law. Matias just joined the college and he was just taking it easy with his friends already. I think our job is pretty good. -Romerito! -Romerito! -I thought you said that you were going back home to study! If he was carefree he would end up like them. -Hold on! Give me your hand.-What you gonna do? -Hold on people -Don't look, dude. Lets see if you are that 'smart'. -What letter is this one? -It's an 'A'. -Very good. How about now? What it says? -I can't see. What is that? -It's an 'A'. -A? -Yes! -See it, his problem is with his left eye. -Haven't you noticed that before? -That's the reason he's not getting well in school! -Yeah, I know cuz I used to have the same problem in school. -Lets tell your mom, right? Come on, Andre. -Where's that? -It's close here, come on. -Up there? To be Captain of BOPE and replace me Matias had to learn that you cannot take it easy. Gangsters don't take it easy. What's up, dude? -How are you? -I took that exam. -So, did you pass? -Yes, sure! -That's my boy! See it Romerito? -Make yourself at home! The guys have Social Conscience. -I wear glasses too. -Maria? -I must go! -Why? -I have to bring my friends car back. -Ok? -Ok. -And about the glasses of our buddy I'll take care of it. -No worries! -Someone has done that for me When I was a child, so I wanna do that for him too. -Right? -Ok? -Ok! -I see you! -See you! -I'll be back to meet your mom, right? -Cheers. -Deal. -Bye. -Bye. -You gonna get there with your lil glasses. -What's up, dude? -What's up? 'Baiano' was the big boss of NGO slum. I know how his story ends but I don't know how it started. He should have had a miserable childhood and to become a gangster maybe was his last resort. -So, what's up, dudes? -That's the 'hot stuff' -Take it, 'Xuxa'. 'Xaveco' bring it on. What makes me pissed off is the guy who had options and ended up in this parallel life. I've already said that before and emphasize it again. Those who supports The dealers, are accomplice And must go to jail. -Whas' up? -Whas' up? -Bruno! -Whas' up? Whas' up? -Cheers! -Marcio, I got the 'stuff' here. -Whas' up? Are you alright? -Get in, come on. -Excuse me! -Hold a sec. ok? -Where is that? -Here, dude, all for you. How many kilos I got? -2kg Only that? -Do you think its easy to get good stuff without pay in advance? -Pay attention! -Two thousand bucks here. -Bring as much as you can cuz the guys can't stop buying. Then I ask to myself: how many kids have to die only cause of one 'playboy' decided to smoke weed? -The priority is to take the guns out of them. -We gonna take it through alley 2. -Azevedo, get your team to go over the bishops place. -Renan and Marcelo, over Tamandare St. -Yes Sir! -Nascimento, do you know the entrance over the 117? -Captain Nascimento, do you know the entrance of 117? I know, Sir! -In this case you go with him, but be careful, there's lots of students. -I know Carvalho. I already told you that I got a bad feeling about this. -Orders must be obeyed. -You will go to Arraia Alley which is on the middle of the hills. -Did you get it? -'SKULL'! For me, strategy has logic when the mission has some sense. The 'Pope's operation' is a stupid thing. In normal situations, I would feel pissed off. But My son was about to be born. I couldn't take it easy. I didn't want to die for nothing. -Come up! -Freeze! Freeze! -Everybody to the ground! -Lay down, you bastard! -To the ground! -Where's the dealer? -None of them escaped, Sir. the dealer is between them! -I want you all aligned here! -Move, move! -I am gonna ask just once! Who was carrying the deliver?? -None of us! -I don't know sir! -Who was with the deliver? -Who was with the deliver? -I am a student. --What the fuck? Move here! -Hurry! Hub your face here! -Can you see that hole here? Who killed this guy? -I don't know. Yes, of course you do! Who killed him? Say muthafucker! Who killed him? -One of you. -One of us, my ass! -You killed this guy here, you fuckin fag! You've been sponsoring all this holy shit. -You fuckin bastard! -We are here to fix the shit you started! You piece of shit! -You put money in that shit! You faggot! -Who was carrying the deliver? -'Zero-seven', bring the 'lil evil' up here. -Let's check now! -Tell us now! Come on! -Show us now! -Who was with the deliver?? Come on, tell us! -Tell us, you motherfucker! -This one with the huddy? So that's you motherfucker! -Take him to the PD. With the deliver. -It's your lucky day, you stupid. -I am not playing the game with you! -Move it! -Move! Run! -Well, we finally concluded that in Brazil, the criminal law works like a web. Which control a lots of Repressive institutions of the state. And unfortunately, today, the consequen ces of what Foucalt says ended up creating a State which protects the riches and punish exclusively the poor. -Alright, 'finito' I think that Maria and all the group Has shown very clear, how the power relations, and not only the state mold bad institutions. now to conclude we could do an analyse of each one give me an example of one institution that fits on it. -The Police. -The police, very good! -But, why the police? -Cause everybody here know that in the slums they thrust everybody. They beat everyone. -Edu is right. The police acts perversily against the miserable ones, and those who are compelled to commit crimes because of their conditions. -Gusmao! -Go ahead! -I'd like to say that I half agree with Edu but I think the cops don't threat only the poor classes I think that we, from medium and high class are also victims of those bunch of fellas. One time I was going with Maria and Natalia to Buzios and we were blocked in a checkpoint and they were very threatening. Thrusting at us with their guns... -But they didn't spank you! -Oh come on!-They showed us the guns. -Stop! Calm down! -Go ahead! -My father is a judge and he said that in Baixada slums the smallest of the punishments is the torture. They go there and kill everybody its like 'chainsaw massacre' -Beside that, they are cowards! -Hold on class! -Everybody will have their chance. Now let's listen to Matias, who's in the line, waiting. Go ahead Matias. -Gusmao, well, I think that most guys have opinions very superficial of what really happens -Hold on! -Very uninformed! -Let him speak! -I could admit that there is corruption on the PD, but in majority the officers just want to do their job, with honesty. -Bullshit! -Hold on!! -Edu is right! Who here has never been in a checkpoint like in buzios? This is very common, the guys want money, they are corrupt and Edu is right in NGO they say that first they shoot you then they found out who's criminal and who's not. -You are mixing up! -So, let's respect and let him finish his point of view. That's sensible! -So, Gusmao, the fact is I got a close friend of mine who is a cop and his best friend is a cop as well. Both are honest. Talking about Buzios fact I think they were right. Surely! -Hold on! -Why not? You must had some weed, hadn't you? You don't know how many kids join the crime and die because of joint and cocaine. From your fine penthouse in South Zone, You can't see those kind of things. Right? You got bad information. You all are influenced by the crap news and midia. -Well, I think that's all so. See you next monday. -Mr. Nascimento, right? Was you on that last Operation in the slums? -Yea, I was. Well, Sir, I just came down here cuz I want my right to bury my son. -Mrs Rejane -Have your son worked for the gangstas? -Yes sir. He was the 'look-out'. -We didn't kill your son. -But you let him go. -Didn't you? -Did you think the gangstas would forgive him? Gangstas kill those who open their mouth. And I knew that somehow. The boy's mom made me feel regret. And regret is a dangerous feeling for someone who works in BOPE -Was he your only son? -Yes, sir. I felt that Rosane was right. It's been about time to find someone to replace me. -Engine calcium, what else more? -Battery -Brake Pads. -Volkswagen's carburator. -Give me a break, fucksake! -Break pads. -Plateau. -Collar. And the windshield that is broken. -Lieut, Volkswagen's carburator -518 -Volkswagen's carburator. -Right! Listen that. -518, this is a brand new its all electronic ignition. -Listen that, Lieutenant. -There's no carburator! -No fuckin carburator, why so? -No carburator, electronic ignition. -Listen the noise, Lieutenant. -No carburator! -Fucksake, you kidding? -No, I'm not! No! -Yes, you are! -No carburator. Yes, there is! No, there isn't! Look at that, what is this so? -Does it have carburator or not? -Yes There's lieutenant. There is, but this is a recycled engine, look at this. loose calcium, everything is loose here. -What the hell are you talkin' bout it? -Another recruits sold the new engine and -Another who? Who did that? -Don't know, Lieut. -We don't know! Don't mind, this is common here. -Few days ago, they stole the radio system of Capt Salgado's car and nobody did nothing. -Fuck sake, are you nuts? -Theft is unacceptable here. This is a PD HeadQuarter. -HQ! -Oh! -Fuck sake, listen to me? -Let's replace the engine. -Fuck sake! Neto had heart of police. He wanted to fix all the problems of the batallion. But in a will to join BOPE squad the fella cannot be naive. Neto should learn that to be a serious officer in Rio, my friend, it is not easy. -Captain, I got a problem -They've replaced the engine... -I'm in a hurry, go ahead. -Someone replaced the new engine for an old one. -I'm sure it was someone from here. -They told who did that? -I'm gonna request an investigation and pick your name as responsible for it. -Me, Sir? -Yep, you! -But, Sir, I got a bunch of vehicles here, I need pieces... -Listen! Don't let the Chief vehicle going dead -I ask you special attention for that shit -Yes, Sir. Captain! -Go ahead, 'rookie' -The missing pieces, -Fuck sake. Too many pieces! -I take a look on it for you. -Now go and talk to Fabio cuz he can find something for you too. -How about you? -Dismissed. It doens't do any good to play the same tune. To fix the problems of PD you must require for the Systems help. The PD Batallions were abandoned by the Public Security System. Without the corruption or the brazilian way, the police stops due to lack of maintenance. -You won't do the stuff by yourself. -I just want to put my vehicles to work, cause I don't want to stay in that sector anymore I hate that car repair place. -You will go to... -'You will go to fuck yourself.' -Just go, just drive it. The first theft is always for a good cause. But, those who become corrupt for the batallion are corrupt for the family also. That is the logic of the system. That's the reason everytime a civilian sees a mobile in front of their bakeries, bars, they know what that means! -What you mean with 'no money'? -I am here to collect my 'bread'. Are you closing, aren't you? -Yes, I am, Capt. but I Already dealt with someone today. -No way, you didn't. -You haven't deal with me yet. -Look the guys behind you. -I dealt with Oliveira. -Oliveira? -If I deal with you again, I'd be broken. -You are breaking me this way. I do security for you and you pay Oliveira? -Why don't you deal with him? After all you work in the same place. -Come on. -How much for that pint? -Nothing. -I want to pay for that! Since the big deal of the PD is to protect The system has twisted protection into business. But those who bribe to keep the law also bribe to make things harder. -Hey! That guy is charging my customers. Even tow-truck there's here, damn it! I can't support you this way. -Who gave this order? -I don't know. -Give me the car pieces! -There's nothing here. -Who gave the order? -Don't know, look that guy. -Hey 'Lil Beatle'! Fly down here. -'How are you', my ass! -Move here, hurry up! -What the fuck are you doing? You are charging in my area, you cannot do that! -Ademar is 'friend' of the Batallion. -Sorry for that, but I m doing my work. -Who the hell sent you here? -Bira! -Bira who? -Who is Bira? Who the hell is Bira? -Bira! -Bira! -Bira, come up here! -I'm busy! The system filled all the cracks in. The Government was so fuckin' broken that it didn't have cash to buy tow trucks for the Police They decide to have suppliers and pay for each towed car. The system took advantage of that. -Stop! Shit! Each Captain gets his own tow-truck and tows everybody. -What the hell? You can't do it here! -Capt. Oliveira runs this tow-truck. I got him in the line, it's your business anyway. -Oliveira... -Tell him about my pieces!! -Hello! -Hello! -Oliveira, Capt. Fabio speaking. -I'm at the car repairs to get my money you lead this here! -Colonel, Fabio on the call. -He's messing up our 'tow truck deal'. -Cut his wings off! -Get out of there now -I call the shots there! -I run that shit! -Alright. -Tell bout my pieces! -Hold on!! Fuck sake! Hello, hello! -That asshole hang up on me. -How about the pieces, fuck sake! -What's the craic? -Dunno, dunno! -Hey, Capt. Hey, Beatle! -There's another Chief. -Friday, the biker comes down to collect the money of the 'deal'. -I told you, that the Chief's bike cannot go dead, otherwise they can't collect the 'arrego'. -Jesus sake, now I'm getting the fuckin point of that. -Everybody used to share the money. Now, its only the Commander and his chapter. we are fucked up! The system has no limits It has no borders. And it's already part of the PD culture. -This Commander has been fucking everybody up. -Even you, Paulo? -Sgt. Since last year that I've been trying to get my holidays for next month And my wife finally got her holidays from the mayor. She's gonna take holidays with me next month. -Very good! -So, I would like to ask you Sir to publish the bulletin to permit my holidays. -Well, in fact, Soldier It will be hard to publish it cuz I got 40 people in a queue with a short number of contingent. -But, well, I have a special deal from the major -And we can fix that, right? -Cuz we are very strict. -Did you get it? -Sgt. Rocha, what I am asking is my right, I haven't had holidays since four years ago, Sgt. You only need to publish what We had already dealt. -I can even help you. I'm gonna help you, I want to help you but, you must help me to help you! -Soldier Paulo, in order to give some smiles you must make the smiles. -Did you get Antonio? -Do you understand? -You must make smiles. -I got it, Sgt. Yes, I got, Sir! -Permission to leave, Sgt. -Permission conceded, Soldier. -Sir, I don't know nothing bout cars Could you replace me to slums operations? -You've just joined the Batallion and want to move already? -I don't want to move. I want to help for real! -I am a good shooter. -Well, rookie, if you make 70% of those vehicle working properly I can think about your order. -Right? -But Sir, I... -Dismissed. -The system makes the cops going nuts. And unfortunately BOPE is not different on this. -Hey darling, are you climbing up or not? -Darling, are you OK? -Are you feeling sick? -Beto! -Beto! -Are you alright? -Uh-huh. -I'm fine! -Are you sure? -Uh-huh. -Holy Shit, I'm feeling fuckin sick. -Relax, darling. It's nothing to do with heart. -I can't feel my arms. -It's just stress. Believe me. -Nascimento, your checkings are 100% ok! -Check that shit again, Dr. Madeira. -Everything was checked. -All my relatives are prone to heart attack. -My father died by heart attack. -Buddy, you have an iron heart. -When I'm in silence, I hear a noise. -My hands are shaking... -Your problem is emotional. -It's not physical. -What you mean? -You are facing chronical stress -I m gonna forward you to the psychiatrist. -Psychiatrist? What the fuck? -It won't hurt, buddy! -In PD who is honest always got fucked up. Someway, somehow. Matias had worked 2 months to do the criminal spot of the county. He took the occurrences and did a map of the murders. -Finish, Chief. It was only the Chief put the right vehicles in the right places. And everybody would be protected. -Uno, 435 in Tabajara. But that is not the way that the PD works. The PD is the system and the system Doesn't work to fix the problems of the society. The system works to fix the problems of the system. -Fuck sake, Estevao this report will fuck me. to the Command? - Colonel, I checked the job of the rookie and it seems all right. -rookie, do you wanna fuck me? -No, Sir! -Call Fabio now! Hurry up! -He'd better explain me about these 4 bodies found in Tabajara. -Col., that report is based in statistics. -Fuck Numerology! -This guy wants to show me where to put my patrols. Everytime there's a crime in the Batallion area the responsible must be charged for that. But to seek the murderers is a pain the ass. -Sir, did you call me? -Yes. -What's the matter? -Lots. I want to know What do these 4 bodies in Tabajara mean? -It's not my fault! -I did it all like you asked but... -'Mare zero', no bodies left in area of 'mare uno nine'. -The bodies, according to information, are alligned in 'mare-two' It's easier to change the crimescene than seek the murderers. There's a lots of scumbags Chiefs that reduce the criminality dropping the corpses in other batallion areas. but in PD, dude. Nobody takes it easy. -'Mare zero'. The bodies are placed in 'mare uno nine', roger that? -But those assholes, they catch the bodies and throw them back, I throw them out again, and vice-versa. -It's a 'grocery store war'. -I don't give a shit. You must fix that. -But Sir! -Finish! -Yes, Sir. -rookie. -You gonna re-do that report. -Look at that: -'One body found in the beach.' -Body found in the beach is death by drowning! -But, how about the perforation? -Are you a forensic expert? -No, Sir. -Until Monday I want a new report here on my desk Cuz this one here. -has never existed! -Dismissed! -Permission to leave, Sir. I also tried to modify the PD system. And my plans were also denied. -If you don't say a word, it will be hard to help. -I know. Cause it's hard to speak, you know. I'm not sure if All that I'm going to say to you would be reported to my superiors. -If it will, so I'd rather speak bout a friend of mine. Who is about to have a baby and is facing a situation. -Capt.! -In his job! -I only answer your question if I really know what's wrong. -Besides that, this is not a confessional. This is the PD psychiatrist's office. Have you imagine If I would have to report Everything that I've heard here? There wouldn't be no officers in Rio. -Well. It's up to you if you wanna speak or not. -Excuse me. -Nascimento! -As soon as I can I find someone to replace you. -Colonel -Captain. I need you in Pope's Operation. -For me, mission given is mission accomplished. -Did you understand? -Yes, Sir. -You can leave it. It was an irony of the fate. The same day that I was about to loose my hope of quit BOPE, it was the begin of a story that would change many people's life. To better And to worst. -What's up Neto? -About time! -Do you have the car key? -Damn it, are you kidding? You are messing the criminal spot? -I found out how I will quit that repair place. -Come with me and I tell you the plan. -Come on! -What you mean? -Come with me! -Fuck sake You must be crazy. -Because of that Chief, I've been fucked up in the station. -What you mean, Fabio? -He cut my deal off, Matias. -Not even the money from this club I have more. -Look at him, that scumbag! -So you were bribing here too? -Well, -I earn 500 in a month. Do you think that I'll keep going to the slums to be killed for 500? -What's the deal?? -Have you collect money from this disco? -We played fair! The only scumbag is the Chief who used to go up the hills to charge the hood. -Are you kidding? Is he bribing too? -You are too naive! -Haven't you noticed that only the Chief team goes every week to the hills? -Do you think he does something for free? He goes for the money of the traffic. -How much is he making for that? -6 bucks a week. During my time Nowadays must be much more. Its loads of money! That Scumbag is making lots of money. I got a plan for us. -How much I earn with it? -What do you mean? -What? You really think that you gonna keep that money for you? -No, no way. I'm gonna use this money to buy the pieces for the vehicles because I want to change to another station. -And how much will you pay to me? -Don't you want to fuck the colonel? -What? You want to mess with me! -You know what? I'm gonna pee, see ya! You are joking! -What's the matter, Fabio? -You stay there! I'm leaving. -Hey, hold on! -Fuck! -You are not going to give up, are you? Are you? I have to confess that Neto's idea made all the honest officers feeling better It was 100% calculated, It would last about 40 min for Matias to collect the money of the mafia. -The biggest deal of the sucker major. That was the Neto's job. -So, what's up, Tiao? -Give a start to see if it works now. -Hurry up, cuz I m late. -Ok, Lieut. -He's late, huh -Soon, I ll be in trouble here. -You want Child's play? Try to chew water upside down. -Capt. is a sucker! -It will work, this time. -Will? -It was supposed to be on the streets already, Tiao. -One touch! -It's broken again! -Call Paulo! Hurry! -When Neto started the engine, Matias has already collected the money. -That's my boy! -Whas' up, Santos? -Whas' up? -Are you better? -Well your buddy has came and he said that you were sick. -Me? Sick? -Yes, I just gave him the money. -Who's that? -Your mate dropped here in order of the Colonel. I just gave him the money. Holy shit! Fuckin Bastard! -Come here now! Come on! -What the Colonel could do? Call the Police? -Undo. -To the right. Neto used the system against the system. -It was a brilliant idea, but also very dumb. -Now we got 10 vehicles working, Matias! The system would charge its money. But at least, he tried to fill the cracks in. Matias was insisting in mistakes. -I got stuff to do. -I gotta go too! -Bye -Bye! -Hey, long time no see! -How are you? -Fine. -Hey. -Try this one. -Look who is showing up! -I can't believe. We're fucked! -What's up! -Hooray for Maria! -How are you? -We were out there. Chatting and drinking. -Will you stay quiet here? -We are just drinking. -I'm gonna dance now. -See you! -Bye! -Only because we own 'fine apartments in south zone.' -Hey, check that, I m gonna joke with that bastard. -Don't start a mess! (Cops are only for those who need them!) -They want to joke with me. (Cops are only for those who need them!) -Don't worry. (they ask you to obbey!) (they ask you to answer!) (they ask you to cooperate) (they ask you to respect) (Cops are only for those who need them!) -More potatoes. -Yes. In PD the system protects the corrupt. The Colonel couldn't complain about the stolen bribe money. But he could get even Matias became Cook Neto fixed the vehicles but stayed in the car repairs, still. -Paulo, why you are here? -I'm on my 'holidays' lieut. -This is for the one who make complains. -How about the repairs? And lost a mechanic. -Tiao! Do you wanna fruits salad? -I told you this wouldn't finish good. Fortunately the Colonel thought that they were only obbeying orders. Orders of someone who knew the System very deep. -Fabio! -Yes, sir. -I want you to check a denunciation of a ballroom in Babilonia slums. -Me, sir? -Yes. -Alright, sir! -Tonight! -Tonight?! -Dismissed! -As you wish. -Excuse me. For him, the punishment would be much worst. That was the point that Matias and Neto story began to link with my story. -Darling -It's moving a lot! -It looks like an ET but it's the most beautiful thing in the world. -Too pity that you are not here -Hey, listen to that. Every time I thought about my son I remembered the look-out's mom. It might be very painful to not bury your own son. -BigMouth! -Get ready cuz we will leave. -Where are we going? -To Turano. -We gonna search for the Look-out's body. -Hey buddies, Colonel asked me to investigate a Funk ballroom -That slum is a joy to come -tonight, if we do the right thing we can deal but if the Colonel knows that... -What the fuck? Why that gun?. -God sake don't fuck with me up there. -Don't mess -Trust in me, relax! -Capt, are you ready for the ... -Colonel asked me to come on this. -No, no. You are coming with me You, leave that gun and look after the Colonel bike. Come on! Hurry up. -Neto, did you steal the money of the mafia? -Yes, sir. -Come on captain. -Time for the show. They're gonna kill me. -Matias, we are fucked up! Follow me. -What's wrong? -They think it was Fabio. -Hurry up! -Take care of this. -In God we trust! DJ! -Come on! -Which way? -Come on! come on! -Lay down! -Hold on! Hold on! -What can you see? -Hold on! -We don't need that tonight! -The slum is quiet. -What the fuck? -Move, move! -Can you see Fabio? -Hold on! -I deal with that! Hold on! What can you see? -What's up Oliveira! -Once again! -Where is the stuff? -Who did you shot, guy? -Come on! Move it! -Move it! -Fuck! Damn it! -You son of a bitch! -Pull the fuckin' trigger! -I got only one ammo! -It's out of service. -Leave a msg, Capt.! Fuck you, asshole! -Deputy It will be my pleasure to support you. But, if Cabral is elected we will get a new batallion. Much better. -How much you pay me? -Give me a sec. please -Hey Colonel. -Capt. Oliveira! -Colonel call the BOPE! Call the BOPE! -What? -Captain! Captain! -There's a team surrounded in Babilonia It seems that there's injuried cop. -Nobody is in HQ Everybody is on Turano. So, what's the deal? -Fuck sake! -Nobody is in a hurry here! -I can stay the whole night. -Where's the body of the look-out boy? -I don't know nothing. -What?? How could? We caught you with guns, and you don't know where's the kids body. -I'm not a dealer, dunno! -So face the plastic bag again! -(Mare 'zero-nine' speaking)! -He fainted, Capt. -Wake him up, throw some water! -Wake up, asshole! -Zero-one, priority in Babilonia cops surrounded. -Copy that, Carvalho! -We are heading there! -Fuck, the guys make shits and we have to fix it! -Head to Babilonia! -How about that 'worm'? -Put in 'Pope's tab'! -Turn around! You bastard! -We're gonna die! -Fuck sake! -They are shooting on the fellas there. -Behave yourself and stay here! -Change the magazine! -We gonna fuck them! -Shoot motherfucker! -We're gonna die! -I'm low on ammo! -Shit! -My ammo has gone, Neto! -MPD! MPD! -MPD! MPD! -To the ground! -Get out of the hole! -Get down! -Zero-one! Look after the two fellas. -BigMouth, look who's here! -Zero one! This is Marcinho, the boss of the slum. -Let's take him down. -Are you OK? -Yes, Sir! -Is anyone injuried? -No, Sir! -Anyone shot? -No, Sir! -So, tonight you gonna learn how to carry bodies. -Yes, sir. -What are you waiting for? -Come on! -Hold a min.! -Hi darling. -Did it blow up? -Are you sure? -Calm down, remember what they said? -We can make it, ok! -I'm coming now! -And catch you there! Alright? -Bye! -Zero-two! -Go ahead, Zero-one! -Take control of the occurrence Take the bigboss cuz my son will be born. -Congrats!! -Come on, come on! -Come on, take the body! -Come on! Come on! Neto decided to join BOPE cuz he loved fightings. His dream was to fight against the crime in Rio's slums. He was watching our job very close. Matias would join too cuz he believed in Law. -Wait! Wait! -If you weren't here I would be killed by those guys. -The BOPE brought your gun! -Help them to carry the body! -What the hell is that? -Get out of here! -Sgt. -Go ahead! -How can I join your team? -Apply for the exam. -What exam? -The one in PD bulletin. Neto knew what he was doing. Matias didn't. -Carvalho, Be aware about that. -Colonel! -At ease. -Sorry to be late. -No problem. -Tell me. -Is it a baby boy or a baby girl? -Boy. -Raphael. -What is that, Renan? -This is conjuntivitis. -That's fuckin awful. -Put those glasses on. -May I have your attention. -This is a voucher, but not for you. -It's to Raphael. -From that course two man will replace you and you! -Saint Raphael! -Colonel -I will coordinate the best course in all story of the Squad. -You can bet it! -Good! -Let's start now. -This 'zero one' named Andre Pedrosa He is on the mafia. -Are you sure? -Absolutely. -We have a good begin. -He's gonna become a number! -Olavo Carvalho. Dodgy. -That will turn Skull's gum. -How about Fabio? -The Capt? -Yes! -Fabio Barbosa! -He is a very dodgy guy! -He's pimp of the hoes from Copacabana. -Renam! -Can you see it? -He looks like a owl. -Batman! -How about the rookie? -These are the one you saved from the slum. -Col. Estevao of the 19th said that they are very good. -Nice start. -I don't want any burst ear drum, in first class, no guys with hand chopped off, ok? -That fact was an accident. -The rookie hold the gun and the instructor triggered -And the burst ear drum, Carvalho did... -It wasn't my proposal, Sir! -Are you joking? -Without your proposal! -That guy deserved, Sir! Who want to join BOPE cannot date Dealer's friend. Matias was dithering. -He wished to be an officer but also to graduate as a lawyer. If Matias had the Police in his heart he would tell the truth to his girlfriend. He just told that he was going travelling. And left her in trouble -He's been working for us for almost one year -Great. He fixed all of our problems. -Right! Andre had to travel. -He's gonna spend two weeks out. -Can we do for the next fortnights? In BOPE dithering is the same of be useless. For me, Matias would give up the rookie course. -I just got a rookie job for Matias. -You'd better look for another boyfriend! -What's wrong? -What's up Baiano? -You must tell me! -Can you recognize someone on that picture? -Is that your fuckin boyfriend? -I can't believe. -What? -This guy killed my friend. A big dealer. You understand? -So, what you gonna do? -Calm down! -They don't have nothing to do with it. I brought Andre Matias here. -Absolutely. -I just found that now. -Nobody knew nothing. -Are you fuckin pulling my leg? -I'm gonna tell you once. -MPD means ENEMY for us. -Outsiders. -Nobody knew. -Shut up cuz I haven't finished yet. -Who brings peace here? The cops? -Who the fuck? -It's the gangstas. -It's the gangstas -And we are the gangstas -And I'm the boss, do you know what I'm saying? -To work here, you must deal with us. -We do that! -Which side are you, playboy? -We make it! -We make it! -I'm gonna keep eyes on you! -Shut the fuck up! -Calm down! -Calm down. -Keep eyes on him, Xaveco! -Calm down! -Motherfucker! -I will go to the point! -If not, you gonna be in trouble, right? -And keep that news with you! -Come on! When the rookie joined the BOPE The corrupt one has joined too. If Fabio kept working in the station The Colonel would kill him. Poor guy. The guy didn't know that compared to me, the Colonel was a lady. -You have came here, by your own foot. Nobody Absolutely nobody, has invited you. And none And none of you is welcome here. -You'd better take care of your souls, -Cause your bodies belong to us! -I pronounce opened the Ninth Course of Specials Operations. -YOU WILL NEVER BE -SKULLS! -Attack! I recognize that for those who are beginners, BOPE looks more like a sect. But it is exactly what they must be! -Ask to go home! Our men become graduates by being beaten. To join, the dude must prove that he can take the pressure. -Ask to go back to your place! -No, Sir! -Ask to come back home! -No sir! -Do you think we don't know that you collect money from the gangstas? -Or that you deal with the mafia of cassino? -Do you know why your codename is 'Zero-one'? -Because you will be the first to give up! -And I will force you to give up! -Ask to quit! -Ask to quit. -Otherwise you're gonna quit under beatings. -I give up! -Zero-one gave up! From 100 cops who join the BOPEs course only 5 passes to the last module. When I was the instructor, it was only 3. Neither Israel Armies have soldiers like we do. -BOPE GOT WARRIORS WHO KILL GUERRILLA FIGHTERS. -WE KILL THEM ALL AND WE SMASH THEM ALL. -KILLING, SMASHING, USING ALWAYS THE RIFLE.

Matias surprised me, he passed the first module But made the mistake to go back to the College. -Maria! -Do you know who told me That you are a cop, Andre? -What's wrong? -The big boss of the slum! -Do you understand? -Do you know the situation? -Or for how long I've been trying to work for the NGO? -How much of myself I gave for that? Do you know? -Calm down, Maria! -What? You had no right to put my life in risk! -I was threatened!

It is not just pick the best of the class. He must do the work like I do. I couldn't quit without this certain. -I think he will be ready to replace me in about one month. If Neto had the same intelligence of Matias my life might had been much easier. But who said that life is easy? -Changing direction-target. On the second module of the course. -FIRE! We teach the guys how to kill efficiently and with dignity. And believe me, that is possible to do. -Load holster. -Good shot, 'Zero-six'. -Standard. Of course its much easier when you are using my rifle. -'Skull'. -Come on, you four now! -'Twenty-three'! -Are you without your riffle-leash? -Yes, Sir. -Long time here and you don't have your leashes? -If your mate is shot and falls on the ground, what will you do? -Would you drop your riffle off? -No, Sir. -Would you stick it in your ass? -No, sir. -So, PUT THAT SHIT NOW! -Yes, Sir! -Fuck sake! -Twenty years training! Only the foreigners think that slums are all the same. No way. Some slums you only go in by climbing. some others we go through the jungle. -Tutor, Azimuth 90 degrees, roger that? -Ok, call the patrol. BOPE officers don't take in the slums just shooting around it. They use strategy. Progressing alley by alley. -Move! -Once you checked, keep going! -Keep going! -The focus is to twelve o'clock. -Look forward, close your face, keep the evil face. -Once you checked the cover, keep going. -Look at me! -Slow down, 'Zero-six'. Slowly -Calm down! The progress in slums is an art. And to be Captain of BOPE You must be an artist. -Slice, and walk by. -Excellent, 'zero-six'! That is it, my boy. -Slice and walk away. In my Instruction I couldn't allow any mistake. -That is it! -It's all about patience. -Keep the form, wait! -Is the cover there? Yes! -No rush. Even if there's a war going on, you must progress slowly. -Look forward! Is the way free? Go ahead. -Go ahead! -If it's free, just go! -That is it, 'zero-six'. Standard, that is it! Men in black uniforms only go to the slums to kill. Never to die. -The one that would replace me must knew that. -Captain. Captain! -'KT' ran away to the left. -Was he alone? -Yes, he was. -I'll catch him. -Hold on!! Fuck Sake! -He's on the root. On the root. -Move back! Fuck sake! -Move back!

Quit what? -Quit what? -You will quit BOPE. -Won't you? -What's wrong? -You will quit, won't you? -Are you ok? -What's going on? -I reckon that I picked the wrong guy. -What that means? -It means that I fucked myself -Azevedo chose one and I chose another guy who is nuts! -Why Azevedo has priority? You tell the Colonel that you are Dad... -Azevedo got two kids! -Two kids! Two! -Not so loud! The baby is in bed! Fuck sake! There was only one thing that made me more pissed off than go to the operations. -Don't dismiss the guy yet, you said he was good what's wrong? That was Rosane telling me what I should do. -When is the graduation? -Everything will be fine, just relax! -Every little thing. I love you! -That is it, fella. -Are you sure? -Hey, I got a better deal for you. Check this out, that's a cool female indian. -Indian my ass. 'Stab the skull', brother. -To the wall, move! The guys recently graduated in BOPE's course are very sharp. And Neto enjoined that crazy action. As soon as he joined my team he just kicked ass in an operation John Paul Second. He wanted to keep Pope safely.. And with him on my team The BOPE's course prepair the guys for the war. And I don't care if people say that this is not-human. Rio de Janeiro is a city in war. If the gangsters are making money to buy guns the war will keep going on and on. All BOPE's officers learn that. Matias was right. He might faced those users. -I'm leaving, people. -What's up -I want to chat with you -Come here! -Hold on! -Chill out, I won't put you in jail, not yet. -Who said I'm afraid of that? -You ass-kisser. -Can you see those glasses? -That is to Romerito. -Give me. -Drop it now! -I will take the glass personally. Right? -If you go there, you will be... -I don't hang out with hooked. -You'll do what I'll ask you. -You gonna make it for tomorrow... -At 12 o'clock -In the arcade games, as I will bring the glasses for the boy. -Ask Maria! -Hey! Are you nuts, boy? If you don't do that shit to me I will put you in jail, right? -You good-for-nothing. -Do you think I don't know what you sell here? -Tomorrow at twelve o'clock! -I'd better ask some platinum for your nose. -You are snorting too much. -Absolutely. -Xaveco -Here they are. -Galego, -I will have no joint today, cause things are fucked up there. -What's wrong, dude? -That motherfucking cop, he showed up and threatened me. -What? -MPD? -Hey, What's the story? -What's the story with that MPD? -What he said? -He said... -Say! Tell us! -What the fuck is that? -Neto. -What's up, Beto. -There's a message from the office for you. -What message? -Asking you to come at 10 o clock for an interview and I confirmed that. -Alright, But... I don't want nothing from them. -Are you nuts? That's the reason that you are studying. -Get that job, dude. -Go to the point! No stuttering, come on! -The NGO that Maria runs here... -Fuck the NGO! -There's a kid down there who is blind... -I can't make it. I'm going to bring the glasses for the lil' boy. -He was born blind, can't he wait a little bit more? -What's the story? Go to the point! -He's coming up here so... -No, not here... -You know how it's important for me, don't you? -What did you arrange with him? -The meeting will be on the arcade games. -Say the fuckin' time! -Open your mouth! -Twelve o'clock! Matias has told me much later that he wouldn't go to the interview if Neto wouldn't have insisted on that. He felt like becoming a lawyer. Have you got any idea about what you gonna do? -Barely idea. I want to specialize in criminal law. I didn't make a mistake about my substitute. -Hey, give me a coin. -Are you loosing or winning? -Loosing. -You can't loose, dude. -Buddy, give some coins to him. -Romerito. -He's here, come on! -Hold on! -There's a kid! Anyway the guy is trapped. -Are you Romerito? -Yes sir. -Give me a shake. -I have a gift for you -That is it. -Now you will be able to see, right? -Where's he? -At work, try it! -Wow, dude! -Now you have a business man look. -No jokes, man! -Hey, I think you'd better leave now. -Get out! -Don't shoot, cause I will kill that scumbag. -What's wrong? -What the fuck? -What the fuck? -Fuck Sake. -Motherfuckin' BOPE. -Move, move. -Get the body out of here. -He's still alive! -Stop the car, now! -Get out, get out! Get out! -Get the fuck out! Get out! -Take Lombada out of here. -Kill the fuckin' 'pig'! The dude who runs a slum can be nuts but cannot be stupid. Baiano knew that to kill someone of BOPE is the same of sign your sentence of death. Gangstas don't take it easy too. If Neto dies, Baiano will be fucked up. -Hello! -How are you? Only rich people with social conscience Don't understand that War is war. -What the hell? -You shut the fuck up! -What's going on? -Can you tell me where's Matias? -Over there. -He will stand, Carvalho. -What you mean? -Yes, he will. -He was shot twice in the back. -They left instantly. -What do you want? -Is your friend ok? -No. -I went to the PD, Andre. And they say they couldn't help me... -How about the kid? -He's fine. -He's gonna stay with me in my place. -But they took Roberta and Rodrigues. -Who cares, after all Baiano got 'social conscience'. -Don't be sarcastic, Andre. -Rodrigues was bleeding... -I thought that you were a honest officer. -Now, I'm an officer. -Besides that, they have already been murdered. -No! No!! -No!! -I told you, didn't I? -Here it is, my boss! -No!! -What's wrong? Are you ok? -Don't say nothing about my job in this house! -What? -Don't say anything about my job to me. -Do you understand? -I call the shots here and you are not allowed to say anything about my team. -Do you understand? Did you understand? -I call the fuckin' shots here! -Listen to me. Go to your mom's place take the boy and only come back when I call you. -Where are you going? Tell me! Please! -I'm going to stay right here. Last night, two bodies were found 'carbonizados' in Prazeres Slums. -Look! The Police believes that the bodies belong to the students Roberta Lundi, daugther of the businessman, Alceu Lundi, and the Social Agent, Pedro Rodriguez. Ana Luiza is live now with the Public Safety Chief who gives a statement about it. -Do you believe that one of the bodies found belong to the student Roberta Lundi? -Let's wait for the exams of the forensic experts to say something. -However, I want to explain that all the necessary measures were took already. -What's wrong? Neto's death was a tragedy to Matias. They had been friends since childhood. And I felt that I could get an use of that feeling. And I still had my mission to accomplish. -What are you doing here? -Let's not argue, Andre. -Am I arguing with you? Am asking what are you doing here? -I think I can help you. -How can you help me? -I know someone. -Who? -I tell you if you promise that you won't make any bad to her. -Right. Who's that? -Rose. -Now you will say! You bitch! -You must tell us now! -Where's your fuckin' boyfriend? -I don't know. -Look at me. Where's that asshole? -Don't know. -Where's he? -Don't know! -Fuck sake, do you think I'm joking? -Stop!. You'd better tell us now! -You lost! Put your hands up! Look at me! -Look at me and don't fuckin move. -Don't fuckin move! -Where is Baiano? -I don't know! -Where's the fuckin' scumbag? -Where's the fuckin' Baiano? You asshole! -Where is Baiano? -Tell us! -Where is Baiano? -Who is playboy? -Playboy, who? -Captain, I know who he's talking about it. -Nobody makes a protest for cops who are killed. The protests are only for the high-society. When I see meetings against the violence, dude. I feel like kicking everybody. -You asshole! -Stop!! -What? -What the hell? -Get out! -You asshole! -Stop! -Fuck off! -Stop!!! -Get out of here! -Don't hold me! -Stop!! Andre! -He killed my friend. Shit! -He killed my friend! -What's wrong? Are you thrusting a cop? -Are you beating a cop? -Get out! -You are a bunch of scumbags! -Just like him -All scumbags from high society. -Get out of here, Andre. -Get out! -What? -You bitch! -You are like him! -Fuckin hooked. Matias wasn't there only because of his friend. He was becoming a real cop. -Fuck!-What? -Where's the fuckin' joint? -You'd better say you fuckin' bastard, where's the fuckin' joint? -Stop, stop!! -Ok, ok. -Hurry up! -You faggot! You motherfucker! The point was to find out if he would have heart to go until the end. -Come on! My mission was not only to protect the Pope. That mission, Neto had already accomplished. What I wanted was to come back to my family. And pick someone with dignity to replace me. -Get out! Get out! -Get out! Get out! To do that... First I should seek Baiano. -Get out! To the corner! What I was doing wasn't legal. -To the wall! To the wall! -Turn around! Get out! I couldn't abuse of the community Just to seek Baiano. At that point, dude... for me, all is fair in war. Nothing in this world wouldn't stop me! -Take your team to do the 'three-six-zero' up there. -Yes sir. -In that entrance over there. -There's nobody around it. -Yes, Sir. -We gonna take the scumbags out, house by house. -Open! -Police! -Wake up, motherfucker! Move! -Good morning, son! -I would like to ask permission to do a search in your house. -Yes, Sir! -Can I make myself at home?-Yes. -'Zero-four'! Do a search in the wardrobe. -Check this out! -'Zero-one'! -This is more expensive than my gun. -Where did you get these shoes, son? -I won, sir! -You lost, come on! -Capt. I'm having a bad feeling about it. The community is observing us. -I really got a shit feeling. -Renan!! -The guy killed Neto. I'm here because of him and I'm gonna put him down today! -Do you wanna quit? -We'll go to the jail! -If you wanna leave, go ahead take your guys with you and go. -Are you feeling pity? -Take all the 5 guys with you. -Stay here only if you want! -Move, stand up! -Are you student?? Do you know how to fly? Get down on your knees. -I don't want to hurt you I don't want you to be injuried. Ok? -Yes, sir. -Where is Baiano? -Don't know, sir. -Bullshit! -I'm gonna show you the plastic bag. -Get down on your knees. -My son, where is Baiano? -Don't know! -Where is Baiano? -Don't know. -Where is Baiano?? -Dunno! -Tell us! Where is Baiano? -Bring the plastic bag. -Where is Baiano? -Where is the fuckin Baiano, you faggot! -You gonna die! -Tell us! -I don't know, sir. -Capt. He doesn't want to say, sir. -Take his pants out. -Are you going to tell us, motherfucker? -Give me that shit! -Take his pants out! -No, not my ass! I tell you, I tell you. -Go ahead! -Ok, take him -Fuck sake, that calmness is too strange. -Relax, my boss, we gonna stay locked here. -Don't know, got a bad feeling. -This slum is very quiet today. -Relax. -Relax, my ass. Fuck! -Go and get some water. -Here it is. -Nobody in here, Capt. -Hey, Take me to the hospital, please. -You lost, you scumbag. -You lost! -You gonna die! Not in my face. To not mess the funeral. -What? -Not in my face, to not mess the funeral. Baiano was in my hands. -'Zero-seven'! -Bring the Pumpshot here. -Release that boy. Now there was only Matias heart missing. And then my mission would be accomplished. And then I would be back to my family. I knew that I found someone with dignity to replace me. -Go ahead and kill him! -Hold on! -Hold on! -Fuck, not on my face.
