We're looking at a strong Category 3, so board up those windows and get ready for a wild ride. Folks, there are emergency shelters being set up in King County and Scarborough County. (SWITCHING CHANNEL) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (OPENING CAR DOOR) (VEHICLE APPROACHING) Howie! Johnny Gavineau. You got the permit? Yes, I do. (CLANKING) This is against my better judgment. (SIGHS) Okay. Let's get to it. JOHNNY: Yeah, I gotta get back to the coast. (CLEARING THROAT) There's a hurricane coming. (CLEARING THROAT) I got property there. I gotta get the place battened down. (GROWLING) Never touch the cage. Was he trained? Trained how? Jump through a hoop on fire? He can do that? No. Well, does he just sit there and look pretty? I thought he was a circus cat. Circus don't want him. (TIGER ROARS) Look, I'm starting a safari ranch. This is my main attraction. I need, you know, a scary animal. Scary? Yeah. That's what the tourists pay to see. I don't think this cat's scary enough. I'm not paying top dollar for an animal that doesn't scare anyone and doesn't know any tricks. Now, maybe if I'm paying less, say, $5,000 less... Mr. Gavineau, the only reason we are talking is because last month this cat attacked a circus horse while 300 of your tourists ran screaming for their lives. Chased her down, did he? Went 16 feet over a cage. Passed 11 other horses just to get to this one. Silver Dollar was her name. He broke her spine so that she couldn't move, and then he ate her alive. You ever heard a horse scream, Mr. Gavineau? You want to know why he went after that one? Because she was the pretty one. And you're right, Mr. Gavineau. This cat, he's not scary. He's evil. (BANGS CAGE) (LAUGHING NERVOUSLY) This is a waste of time and my gas money. I'll take it! Plus your expenses. Cat hasn't eaten in two weeks. That's how you show him who's boss. And when you move him, you roll the cage with this. (TRUCK DOOR OPENS) Safari park, huh? Well, good luck with that. (TRUCK DOOR CLOSES) (TRUCK STARTING) Good luck with that. Man makes his own luck! Isn't that right, Lucifer? (TIGER GROWLS) Tom, you there? (FEEDBACK ON WALKIE-TALKIE) Tom. Tom, come on. Remember? I told you they have fish here. You love fish. They have all... Come look at this. Come look at this. See, look. Come here. They have yellow fish. Blue fish, purple fish. I think they even have clown fish. Tom, come on. You're gonna be happy here. Mom would have loved this place. Okay? It took me a long time to find it. I know you understand. This is your home now. You cannot come to college with me. Hey. Please do not screw this up. (DOCTOR CLEARING THROAT) DOCTOR: So, you've been living with your stepfather, but you've taken care of Tom since your mother passed away. And after college, will you once again be taking on Tom's care? Yes. No red. That depends on, of course, what's best for Tom at that point. I have custodianship, so I will be checking in on him. Sorry, he does not like red. Well, then let's get things settled. Tom, would you like to say goodbye to your sister? So, I'm gonna take off. I'll see you in a couple of weeks, all right? (YELLING) No! No touch! No! No, no! No! I'm so sorry. (CONTINUES YELLING) I've got... I got his stuff out. He likes this... He likes this God's eye and... When he's walking, he might need it. (SOFTLY) Tom, I want you to be calm. (STOPS YELLING) Good. Can you sit down for me? Can you do that for me? Can you sit down, please? Good. Thank you. You know, who Tom is now is pretty much who Tom is always going to be. People can sacrifice their entire lives taking care of an autistic child. Don't feel guilty if you can't. (DOOR OPENS) (WHISPERING) (DOOR OPENS) There seems to be a problem. Your check is being denied due to insufficient funds? No, that's... That's not right. That little... (DIALING) Do you have another resource? No. What about your stepfather? No. There's money in there. ON PHONE: This is Mr. Fenton. Hi, Mr. Fenton, this is Kelly Taylor. Hi, Kelly. How are you? Could you check the balance of my account for me? Your stepfather withdrew all the money from that account. It's closed. When? Yesterday. So... He said he was changing your house into some sort of safari ranch? I hope that's not a surprise. Yeah, I don't... I don't really care about the animal thing. That money was for Tom. Kelly, sounds like you should take this up with Johnny. Thank you. MAN 1: Wait a minute, wait a minute. MAN 2: Okay! Let's go! Unhitch it! (BANGING ON CAGE) (MEN CHATTERING) Hey, .hombres, I understand that the power of hurricanes has almost doubled in the past 30 years. Now, whether that has to do with global warming doesn't much matter to me, but what does matter is getting this place battened down. Now. (TIGER GROWLING) (MAN 1 BECKONING TIGER) (TIGER CONTINUES GROWLING) (MAN 2 SPEAKING SPANISH) (HISSING) Hey! (SPEAKING SPANISH) (MAN 2 SCREAMING) Shit! (MEN YELLING IN SPANISH) Get me a rag! Here, here, here. Shit! I want you to keep pressure on it, okay? Like this. Now, listen to me. I want you to go to the clinic down the road. Okay. All right? They'll take care of you. They will not deport you. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Now go. And fast! He's gonna lose that finger! God damn it! I just said unhitch me. We're staying here. (BANGING ON CAGE) (TIGER GROWLING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) JOHNNY: Get this place boarded up! (MAN SHOUTING INSTRUCTIONS IN SPANISH) (SCREWDRIVER WHIRRING) Johnny! Where are you? What is this? Johnny? Where did the freezer come from, huh? (TIGER GROWLING) (BANGING ON CAGE) Hey! What the hell are you doing? That's a carnivore in there. (MIMICKING TIGER) You understand? Now, go back in the house where it's safe. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Out here, not safe. In the house, safe. Now, go on. Run. Hey! Where's my money? What money? My bank account. You closed it. Wait a second. That's not your money. Of course it is. I went to the bank, I asked if there were any other accounts, they said just one, co-signed by your mother, so I took it out... So, you stole it. You doing drugs? What? Because drugs will damage both the hippocampus and the amygdala portions of the brain. That's where we process memory. Your memory's a little foggy here. I have to remind you that your mom didn't leave a will. She did. Hey. She wanted me to take care of Tom. That's what she said. Written on a Post-it note. Wasn't a Post-it note. She wrote her wishes for the future of you and your brother on a note. Nobody's happy your mom swallowed a bottle of pills. I also have to point out, in the absence of any other information, the money, this house, goes to me. Now, I don't know, if she'd have wanted it any different, she might have written another Post-it. Just don't do that. Don't talk about her. (KELLY SIGHING) Look, I don't care what you bought. I need what's left. (CLEARING THROAT) That's gonna be a problem. What? I don't have it. How? How could you not have it? You just got it out yesterday, right? I bought a tiger. (SCOFFS) You're crazy. People are gonna pay to stay here, they want the real deal. A Bengal tiger is the real deal. That money was for Tom, for his care, so that I could know that he was all right. Kelly, you don't have to put your plans aside to help your brother. Just leave Tom with me. (SCREWDRIVER WHIRRING) (DOOR OPENS) JOHNNY: Damn it, Jose! I said use the big screw! Eat. It's 5:30. Want eat. Right. No! No, no, no, no, no! Look. Okay? There. Okay, let's go. Come on. So, what are we gonna watch today? Want to try something different? Oprah? Ellen? A little History Channel? Arrgh, matey! Arrgh. The Taylors. Fascinating viewing, even after the 785th time. MOTHER: Arrgh. Kelly, come closer. I see my We got an 8-year-old pirate. There's two, Tommy, three, four, five, couple more, six, my pirate, seven, eight candles. Let's light those candles, Tommy! Oh, it's a little windy out here. We got two. We got two! Make a wish and blow them out. Happy birthday, my good boy. I love you so much. I just want you to be happy. Come on, nestle close. ON PHONE: This is Tom Lewis. Hi, Mr. Lewis, this is Kelly Taylor. Hey, Kelly. How's it going? I'm glad I caught you. Are you on campus already? Is everything okay? There's been a hitch. (SIGHS) Okay. What's going on? Yeah, I'm just... I'm gonna need a few months to take care of some family business, and I'm just gonna start second semester. Kelly, you've deferred the scholarship twice already. This is about your brother, right? You're not his mother. He has a stepfather. Now, you need to make the right choice here. Otherwise, I am giving this money to someone who needs it. Mr. Lewis, I need it. Okay, that's what I want to hear, because I am really not kidding. Kelly, if you don't show up, there's nothing I can do. That scholarship is gone. Do you understand? I understand. This is a big step for you, but look how hard you've worked for this. Kelly, I really believe you're making the right choice. Thank you. Me, too. Okay. See you soon. (STAIRS CREAKING) Stop it, Tom. I just need a minute. This is my mad face, do you understand? Stop it. (YELLING) Don't touch! (SHOUTS) Hey! Where did you get this, huh? This is Mom's. Why have I not seen this? What is this? Have you taken any of these, Tom? Tell me right now. Have you? Seconal. Christ, Mom, what weren't you on? (SIGHS) (SCREAMING) God. (DOOR OPENS) (DROPS TOOTHBRUSH) (WIND HOWLING) (TIGER SNARLING) Hey, Tom. Time to go to bed. (BANGING ON CAGE) (TRUCK DOOR OPENS) (TRUCK DOOR CLOSES) (CHAIN RATTLING) (TIGER GROWLING) (MUFFLED SCREAMING) (GASPS) (THUNDER RUMBLING) ANNOUNCER ON RADIO: After a night of watching and waiting, say good morning to Hurricane Isabel. Storm made landfall just after 5:00 this morning. We're talking coming in off the Gulf Coast. If you're in Montgomery County, you are not in danger, but don't worry. We'll be here with you the whole way... Outstanding choice. (CLANKING) (RUSTLING) (RUSTLING INTENSIFIES) Hello? Tom? (SNIFFLING) (GASPS) (WIND HOWLING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Damn it!

Right this minute... I'm supposed to be unpacking... Pretending that I like my roomate. Supposed to be... (SNIFFLING) Staying up all night studying for my philosophy midterm smoking French cigarettes. Meeting some great guy... Who can look at me and say... "You're funny"... "You're smart"... "And you know what?"... "I think that I'm in love with you." That's where I'm supposed to be right now Tom. (SNIFFLING) KELLY: What? You bastard. (SNIFFLING) Please let there be a way out of this. Show me the way out, please, God. Let there be a way out of this. TOM: This Sucks. But, it's not such a bad way to go. As soon as he bites me... My sympethetic nervous system will put me into a state of shock... I'll pass out. Before I know I'm drowning from internal bleeding... I'll be dead. (THUNDER RUMBLING) KELLY: I'ts gotta be in here, where is it?.. Where is it? No! No touching! (EXCLAIMS) Are you out of your freakin mind? It's in a cage. It's not like it would be wandering around the whole property. How the hell are you gonna keep this thing under control? Starve it. How's that? You have to starve them. Hasn't eaten in two weeks.
