The remnants of this war with Titans build three huge walls in order to ensure stability and peaceful life within. Eren! Don't be afraid, it's a dud. This blue color, that must be the ocean. It's really out there. The bird should have seen the ocean, right? We were born inside the walls does it mean we will also die there? Is that okay? We will soon begin to scout outside the wall and we will find a new land where we will be able to live freely. Nobody knew that our peace was only... ... a prelude to despair. The legends are true! I have personally seen the end of the world. Filled with the smell of blood, ugly, noisy hell. In the end where did they come from, but also where are they going? Mikasa! At the edge of hell, Eren even lost Mikasa. With trampled promises, deprived of a future and crushed dreams, we have however yet to give up the last glimmers of hope. In order to retrieve the land that was taken away, the repair of the damaged wall is our priority. We would blow a part of the wall and fill up the hole, that was our mission. But how, even Scout Corps have been wiped out. If we fail, the human race would become extinct. Now we have the Three-dimensional Maneuvering Equipment! We decided to challenge human destiny. Give your hearts! After all the darkness, is it doubtful whether there will be dawn? No one wants to start a loosing fight. A Titan's body is not immortal. Once sustained serious neck injuries, it will be killed. Everyone was saved from the Titans and despair by the hero Shikishima captain. You have to find a good woman as a partner in this fight. And the one that stood beside him was Mikasa. The world is cruel. I just kill Titans, nothing more. Mikasa obviously changed into a different person, leaving Eren confused and disappointed. Would you be my daughter's father? Hiana! I want to defeat the Titans. Then fly out. Our true enemy arent those Titans, it is safety. Humans are constantly suppressed by the invasion of Titans. - Our remaining dynamite! - Don't! Helpless and aimlessly fleeing soldiers. I will not let you die in this place! Eren, he was eaten... The mission has not changed, defeat the Titans! You can't! You're almost out of gas! Maybe we should just be annihilated Maybe that supposed to happen... I'll slaughter all of you! A Titan attacking a Titan? Look at his movements, he has the ability to think! Even revenge cannot mend a broken heart. I'm seeing one like this for the first time, ah! Gradually losing it's true self. Is he on our side? There is no way he is with us. Compulsive feelings. Eren? Cut its neck! If you don't hurry up his cells will be assimilated. Where did they come from? Where should we go from here? Should we continue to fight, have the opportunity to win or will there be only a last survivor, which one will be it? It will hurt a little bit. Good boy. What are you doing to our son? Don't worry, the experiment was successful on other children. I want to know the key to trigger cell division. Are you still a father? Open the door! Open the door! Doctor, open the door. Open it now. Please, take care of Eren. I will. More books than in a library. Doctor it must have been hard to collect so many. For centuries we have swept so hard. Stop! Don't! It's a violation of the specific knowledge protection law. Let me go! Stop! Silly, don't you think so? Humans troubles in this world has been endlessly. Someone always wanted be stronger, richer than others. Thus the invention of weapons, the development of science. The augmented knowledge. When will those conflicts stop? Others said in the past: "When a common enemy appears humanity will unite as one" Hundred years ago such an enemy really appeared, the Titans! With humanity endangered our ancestors erected high walls and imprisoned themselves inside. However it was good. Limited land, food, resources caused careful distribution of those goods. There were no disputes, we we're all equal. People bonded together. But in time our hearts became rich again. So we started to fight over sources of knowledge, science and technical specifications, thinking that eternal peace will come. But... if a human have become a Titan, what do you do? I ask you, are you a human or a Titan? Are you a human or a Titan? I asked you a question. I'm human... If a human loses a limb it will not regenerate. You became a Titan, you came out of a Titan, everyone saw you... I'm human! Right! I am a human, right? Where is captain Shikishima? He was last reported seen falling dawn from a wall right after the failure with explosives. I'm very sorry... Shoot him. Hey! Eren, he is human. He is our fellow soldier. He cleared the surrounding area of Titians. I see... I can... beat Titians. By now we have sacrificed so many people, but we can win if Eren fights with us. Eren is humanity's last hope! Sir, I am against it! This boy is a very precious observation subject. He is an intelligent Titian! We may be even able to unravel the mystery of the Titans, also perform vivisections, that's so great! Hey, really that's enough. Nevertheless, how can we fill the hole in the wall? Our remaining explosives are gone. We have no way to collapse the wall. No... there is a way! Don't be afraid, it's a dud. A dud bomb... Give me some details! Delaying tactics are useless. You are rebels. Rebels? This is something your partner left. Sir, this belongs to the bomb thief! Even in the past the central government was aware that therefore those who will attempt to topple the institutional forces beginning with our weapons. Just like everyone worried the rebel forces sneaked into the base. The seeds of evil must be removed, before they start to blossom. Let it go. If you die, what will your brother do? Mikasa, what will you do? Will you abandon Eren? Well, then shoot me! My heart is already in pieces! Armin! Damn you old man! You don't have even the courage to bet on me! There you have it, your true nature finally revealed. Because I was born inside the walls I thought that this life has no meaning. Eren... I finally know what I'm supposed to do, so don't hinder me, please! Even the squad leader will defend him? He's a monster and will eat you. This guy is not wrong! Certain time after the cerebral cortex begin to decompose instinct begins to control consciousness and after a little longer the body cells will be assimilated by the Titan. Mr. Souda Uncle... A drunk talking nonsense. Eren... Eren... Your brother... he... Shot! Another "one like this" came out! Is now the time to say it? Sir! Commander Kubal has died. Now I'm in command! Don't shoot! You are not allowed to shoot! His skin is not the same. Eren! Eren! That boy is a precious observation subject! Rescue him! - Yes! He defends himself! The one is also conscious! Wait, all of you wait! It's useless! "Attack on Titan" Mr. Souda... in the end what were you trying to say? We now will go to Monzen take back the dud bomb and fill up the hole in the external wall. Let's go. -Yes. You really want to fix that hole? In addition to being almost wiped out where are we going to get explosives? Didn't you listen before? There is one in Monzen. It's there, right? The bomb! Can you really believe someone like that? And will people even go up this wall? I will go. We have to fix the wall. We already sacrificed too much and we can't let those sacrifices be in vain. That's impossible, I quit. Then go home! If you still have a person to go back to, that isn't between a Titans teeth. Move! You will have to drag my legs. Done. Hurry up, we have to leave before the Titans spot us. Mikasa, what will you do? Mikasa. Don't you want to return to Monzen? Can I go back? You have to. Without me, you will certainly all die. Well, that's right. Who's left now...? That Titan's good friend will not return home? Eren was never an ally of Titans. Then why didn't the Titan eat him? That's... Why do the birds still sing? Clearly it's the end of the world. Captain... That song is meaningless. Why do you think the birds have to sing it? Because they know that the walls are not the end of the world. What is this place? I followed the Titan that caught you and then I saved you. The Titan escaped. Thank you. Look... this is the way this world works. It's shocking... Titans are the true face of humanity. Titans are... human...? They were created by humans, they did not evolve, they were meant as a weapon. However a hundred years ago, somehow they got out of control their numbers exploded. Many humans have turned into Titans. Nobody knew who may turn. Can you guess what happened next? Mankind began to mistrust each other, kill each other and then to self-destruct. This used to be a big city. The people trapped inside these walls never changed into Titans, later a small number of rulers emerged and governed the majority. In this way, a better world was born. Here? There are several rooms like this. Here the government was able to monitor people, to forget and bury the sinful past. Abandon it... Abandon something you have to protect and you will become stronger. That man told me so. I have nothing... not even memories to discard. I understand... Now you are the Grim Reaper to Titans. I have too many things to protect. 10 o'clock in the distance there're Titans! Eight, nine of them! They appear to be common Titans! So normal Titans, that's so boring. I really don't want to die. Hey... Captain Shikishima was only your savior and teacher... is that it? Two years ago, the destruction of the wall was an opportunity for the government. What happened at that time? It was just before the investigation outside the wall began. Yes! People quickly forget to fear the Titans. Loyalty to the government grows weaker. Even with the control of intelligence, living space and the number of children one can have, humans began to try to go outside the wall. Then what happened? The Titan appeared! Correct. Everything occurred exactly as planned. People's resentment turned to the Titans But there were so many people that died! Unfortunately, that's how it is now. How many people must be sacrificed to repair the walls? I saw those, who were swallowed by the Titans, the horror images were engraved in my mind. Until when will such a thing continue? Do you really think the government wants to repair exterior walls? Then for what purpose does this futile mission continue!? Don't you understand? You know. Sacrifice is necessary. Titans and fear must be rooted in the hearts of future generations. People should no longer dare to have ideas about going outside the wall. And to reduce the number of the brave. This is wrong! Therefore, let's end it all. I waited for you a long time. For me? You are different from other livestock. Even if you turn into a Titan, you still retain consciousness This is the evolution. You are a new human being. You are the chosen man to end the era of slavery, to open up a new era. Don't betray the hero inside you. Hero? But... can you rely on me? No self-confidence? Kind of... Come with me. Why did you volunteer to join the troops? People from the inner walls don't need to join the corps. You can have a "Titan" within the inner walls, with huge attitude, no matter what I said he always opposed, my crappy dad. At least you have a father. It isn't good at all. Better than nothing. - It isn't! This can be useful, right? Hey! That's... ...the dud bomb. It's home. Be cautious, we will now enter Titans territory. Everyone! They are like-minded partners. Scout Corps... They haven't been wiped out... You shouldn't believe in everything that people tell you. I just put that false information in order to keep the explosives. How is the movement of Titans? There are four in the far east. That is no problem. I have never seen such weapons before... Those are guns from time before the Titan-War. The government kept them secret. Of course they are useless against Titans, but very effective against people. This gun was prepared by the government to be used against humanity. We are not livestock! Yes, you are your own masters. I miss it... the town where you were born in. By the way I heard that there are still some explosives. Are you ready? I will throw the net. Everything's fine on this side. I tied it up. I'm ready, let us leave. This side looks good too. I must do something with that one. Jean, hurry up. Shut up, I know it. Good, I'm done. This one? -Make it a little tighter. I know! But will it hold? Come on, let's move before the Titans find us. But how will we get it up the wall? We will all have to pull together. If only we could attach it to Eren. Even if he was there, so what? Would he listen to us, humans? For you. The front is okay. We have to figure it out how to detonate the explosives. After we arrive at the outer wall we will take this bomb and... Hey! A gun from before the war? Just let me see it! MGL, yeah! What is this? (Multiple Grenade Launcher) Mikasa! Eren! Eren! - Eren! I'm sorry I made you worry. The captain saved me. You saved us a lot of trouble digging it up. Captain, who are these children? Hope for the future, right? Yes, Captain. One more thing, what is this box? Air missiles. I knew it! Before the Titan war we had equipment that could easily hit a moving target. Not only that, but it will also guide us to victory! Take a look, enjoy it! Fantastic! This is not the RDS! Everybody! The time has come to take this large bomb! We will now rise up and overthrow the government! We have the power to change this world! We will go to the inner wall! Inner wall? We will blow up the walls there! What's with what... The innermost wall. But the Titans will flood the city. It will be like a tsunami, and that's the purpose! With our equipment and the bomb you excavated we will destroy two walls, and the Titans will spread to the center. We will defeat the current system with one strike! The people from between the walls will join us and after we destroy both walls, a new era of reformed humanity will begin! How about it? It doesn't sound bad, right? Eren has already joined us. Wait a minute, I didn't heard any of it! With the explosives we're supposed to fix that hole. What? Are you so clueless? You hate those extremely selfish pigs. But there are also ordinary people that did nothing wrong. Yes, because they didn't do anything others lived a hundred years as livestock. Contributing to an evil regime isn't a sufficient crime? They will never change! Even so, people don't deserve to die. Beautiful words... Are you hearing yourself? Your hands are already dirty, didn't you kill a lot of Titans? Then are also guilty of murdering ordinary human beings. Ladies and gentlemen, are you happy in this world? You don't know freedom, the freedom to live! You don't live free! Now is the time to stand up to these inequalities with us! What? The Titians aren't our enemy, it's the government that controls us with fear! Let us use the explosives and end our lives as livestock! Now is the time to decide! Like I said nothing can be obtained unless you abandon something else. I... The world is cruel. Eren is the last hope of mankind. Would you be my daughter's father? He left his girlfriend in front of the Titans and ran away. If we could find a new land where we will be able to live freely. Are you human? Brother! Help us! That child was eaten... they tried to save only themselves. Please, take care of him. Eren... I will not abandon anything. I don't want to lose anyone again! What are you talking about? I won't let you reach your target with that bomb. Never! How do you want to do it? I won't turn back! How is his man any good? You can't win against me. You know why? Because you can only complain. It's the walls fault, the era's fault the world's fault! You have so many excuses. Another laughable person! You don't have the heart to become a Titan. You really think you can become a secret weapon. It's unwise. You don't know anything about me. I've heard much from you ex-girlfriend there. Enough of it. I see... ...you can't bear it? He was your first boyfriend. Ungrateful thing. Let go of her! You still don't understand me? You have nothing left. Take your dirty hands off, don't touch her! Can we help him? For example... but it's impossible. I'm tired of playing silly games with you. Who was it!? Who throw this? Don't move! If I press this button the bomb will explode! Don't act rashly, or we will blow up together. Everyone, hurry up. Are you okay? You are an idiot! Who would believe such nonsense? This device is designed to detonate bombs, I made it! Right! Well, I give you permission to do it. Come on, blow me up! So, it was a lie. What are you trying now? Sannagi! Armin, go! But... Hurry up, go! He has plenty of brute force. Stop him! Sannagi! That idiot... what will his brother and sister do now? Huh? Well done, you can work great together. However this is the end. This bomb will suffice to destroy the wall. What will you do alone? I'll let you know who is the true chosen one. To do this you must dedicate your own heart. Armin, drive! Everybody, hold on! Oh no, the strongest man is also the strongest Titan, this is bad! You already knew? But I didn't expect... I'll deal with him! You take care of the outer wall! Stop it! Can you really become a Titan? I have no idea, got to try! You are not alone, you have people around you now! As long as we will keep fighting together, we can't lose! We against him! That's... We will always be together. The Titans are gathering! There he comes! As expected, he's powerful. No matter how strong he is, he has only two hands and two eyes, so target his weak spots! Everyone attack! Let's go! Mikasa! He has a blind spot on the left. I will finish him! Got you! Out of the way! Eren! Eren! For my sake... You will lose! It' a shame, I wanted to save the world with you. Eren! Did he lose? Never forget to deal a fatal blow to the opponent. Too slow. You are too slow. That's it. Go, Eren! He has done it. You do remember the bomb, right? Stuff it into the cracks on top of the wall Does he understand what we're saying? That's too loud for us, dumb ass! We will use a timer to blow up the bomb, that way it's safer. But be careful, don't use to much force. Okay, let's go. He seems very tired. Put it into the cracks, there. Eren? After coming all the way here. Wake him up! How? Cut his neck, but don't hurt Eren. Mikasa only you can do it! Don't cut in the middle! Mikasa! I'm saved. As I thought, our pre-war military vehicles are very reliable. Eren. Eren. Eren. Wake up! You promised me... Didn't you promise? The ocean. The bird should have seen the ocean, right? Do you want to see it? Don't worry, Armin is taking care of the rest. Sasha, can you help me hold down there? So? Now I have to mount this. Good. It will explode after five minutes. Let us leave. Are you okay? You worked so hard to reach this place. I didnt thought you had it in you. You are heroes who fixed the wall. You can live for the rest of your lives within the inner walls, enjoying aristocratic benefits. But first you must hand over your Titan friend, and promise to continue to guard the walls. We refuse! We're not going to betray Eren for something like that! Armin! - Armin! Idiots! What are you hoping for in life? We want to know the truth about this world! And what will you do with that knowledge? People simply can't handle the truth. Staying obediently behind the wall, without knowing anything, that way you will be the most happiest. Therefore we should guard the wall! Walls are necessary! Outside the wall you will find hell! Instead of the slavery in heaven, I choose the freedom in hell! Is that alright? Outside you will only find helplessness, at least inside the walls... Sasha Sasha... it's dangerous! It's a lie, right...? The commander is also a Titan. They want to rule us using fear. He prevented us from repairing the wall. Give me a three-dimensional maneuvering equipment with gas canisters. I've been waiting for this day. Damn, he's burning. Hold on! Don't be afraid. Come on, Eren! Don't touch the bomb! Jean! Go to hell! Armin, get up! Eren, no! They actually had such kind of a thing! It's almost time! Eren, run away! You'll die! Dont be silly! For Jean and for everyone I will take revenge! But the bomb will explode anytime now... It's time. Hey! It didn't explode. What went wrong? I will go. Mikasa! Could you target the bomb with this weapon? If you can hit the fuse, it will detonate. There we go... Wait! Mikasa! What now? What a shame they can hit the fuse but you will be blown to pieces. Please, don't take it away. It's useless, no matter how many times the wall will be damaged they still will rebuilt it. Just to save themselves, it's pathetic. How about you... How about your walls? Take that! I admire your tenacity but that's my prey! You have your good years ahead of you. Eren... The commander has been wiped out... How about the wall? Don't worry! The first explosion vaporized halogen, boron, aluminum, silicon, etc. soon there will be a second explosion. Look, here! Amazing! Are you okay? - The hole... - was filled up. Great! Look Everything begins now. Attack on Titan 2: The end of the world. I'm surprised, it seems that the two escaped the experimental area. I didn't expect it. Really interesting.
