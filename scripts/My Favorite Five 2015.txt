Oh! - Come on. - Oh! - Come on! - Okay, he's got a gun. He's got a gun. Here, take it. Take... take all of it. Here. Here, take this. Unh-unh! What are you doing? Hurry up! Come on! Get off! What are you doing?! Hurry up! - Ow! - Just give it to... Hey! Hey! - Are you crazy?! - Come on! - Hey! - Stop hitting him! He's gonna kill us. These are a $2,000 pair of shoes! Oh! Are you crazy?! Show me the gun. - No! - What? - Show me the gun. - No. If I take it out, I'm gonna use it. - You want me to use it?! - Yes. - No, please, don't use it. - I want you to use it. - D-don't make me use it. - No. I want you to use it. No, please, don't use it. I am going to use it! Use it on her! What?! Oh! I am calling the police. - Oh, oh! Wait! - I would like to report A fool in the alley trying to rob people with his finger. Yeah, you better run, mother. You better run! That was close, man. I thought he was gonna kill us. Hey, where you going? Thought we were going back to my place. Hello, Sybil. Hi, Rebecca. Morning. Look, she keeps stealing our accounts. Yeah, I know. And look. Here she comes now. It's time to address it. Hi, Shelly. Good morning, miss colburn. Uh, your messages are on your desk, And, uh, national car rental called. You left a small package in the rental, So I'll have someone pick it up in a little bit. - Thank you, Shelly. - Mm-hmm. Send them my gratitude. Oh, and, uh, set up my trip - for Atlanta next week. - Okay. Okay. Good morning, Rebecca. Oh, good morning, hailey. How nice of you to join us. It's not when you start. - It's how you finish. - Rebecca: And how are you, miss Sybil? Amazing, as usual. - Uh, excuse me. - Yes, Barry? Yeah, what happened with Milton's greeting cards? You know what happened. We collected his money. - But that was my account. - That was never - your account. - Well, it was my account, Till you and your little Charlie's devils stepped over there in your Little mini skirts and halter tops, right? I don't wear halter tops. And don't blame me if you don't know how to close. Uh, speaking of closing, where's your dad? I don't know, just go find him someplace, ass kisser. I will. Right back at you. Yes? Hailey, I'd like to see you In my office for a moment, please. On my way. So, baby, how was Chicago? Mm. Chicago... was rewarding. Is this what I think it is? Mm-hmm. Really? Girl, how did you ever get him to... Daddy, you know you don't want to know. Yeah. Jethro Williams. That man is notorious for not paying his suppliers. Wow, we can probably pick up at least 10 other vendors From this deal. I know. You know, you are amazing. I may be. But the truth is, men are predictable. Play to their egos, and you win every time. Ehh... Listen, with that in mind, though, I've just set up a meeting with h.Q. Distributors. If we can recover for them, Hell, we can take the next six months off. Ooh, I like the sound of that. Who's the mark? His name is Christopher Michaels. He's a c.E.O. Of a new video-game company. I make this one, Everybody gets an extra Christmas bonus. Here we go. Came out with that shooter game last year That everybody went so crazy for, Then the market turned and his sales plummeted And he had to stop production, Leaving his suppliers holding their chain. Promises. Now, on the other side, He just got an infusion of cash from Dakota kimball, Queen bitch of wall street. Seems that she was a friend of his late mom. Wow, she inherited the... The largest exchange in wall street - when her husband died. - Correctamundo. Now, a little bit on the up/down side, We know he has the money, but he still hasn't paid, So we have to convince h.Q. That we can recover for them. No problem. You think? Won't be easy. He owes them over $5 million, But he needs at least that much to bring his new game to market. Daddy, if you knew half as much As I know about men, You'd know this money was practically in the bank. You bad. So, they have 17 locations That we need to close. All right, let's get started. Oh, so, what happened last night? Ooh. You don't want to know. Yes, we do. Spill it. I mean, he was beautiful. Oh, he looked like a big feral lion. Yeah, he may have looked as strong as a lion, But he had the heart - of a little baby rabbit. - What? I just don't understand. If I date a good-looking guy, he's a dog. If I date an average guy, he's lame. If I date a romantic guy, he's... He's a punk. Maybe you want too much. No! Not possible. I just want everything I bring to the table. - What's wrong with that? - Sarcasm - and nymphomania? - Oh! Rebecca! I will get on you later. I'm about to have lunch with my brother. Oh, he is so cute. Tell him "hi." You know, usually when you share a meal with someone, You engage them in conversation. Oh, my bad, sis. I'm just updating the grid. You seem kind of down. Why is your species so dysfunctional? You mean the male gender? Yes. No, see, men are very simple. Feed us, freak us, and need us. You the complicated ones. I just want one man... just one. But whenever I find a guy that's great in one area, He sucks in all the others. You see, that's your problem. You can't find everything you need in one person. Why not? That's like... needing the capacity of a minivan But wanting the sexiness of a convertible. Well, I refuse to compromise. Know what? You shouldn't. I don't. Welcome to the grid. - Mm. - What is this? Man has five needs... Sex, attraction... No. Aren't they the same thing? No, your best sex may be with somebody You need to put a bag over their head. Then why have sex with them? Clearly, you are not a man. Here. What is this? It's my new audio book... "My favorite five." I'm working on the female version next. Really? - "My favorite five"? - Yeah. You're crazy. You know that, right? No, am I? Am I crazy? Okay, why did every primitive society have multiple partners? How can one person be good at everything? Hailey, you're literally trying to find perfection Or only settle for a couple of your needs being met. Ah. Mnh-mnh. But I'm the crazy one, right? Ew. I got to go. You're not gonna pay for lunch? No. I owe you. Just like a man. As homo sapiens, We were never meant to be monogamous. Living in that abhorrently dysfunctional state Only keeps us miserable and underachieved. After having your sexual needs met, And you need to be with someone Who simply makes you drool, Next you must find someone to meet that spiritual need. This would be your soul mate. Not sex mate. That's someone else. Soul mate. Hello, ladies. What can I get for you tonight? Oh, let's see. Tonight, I have Peter. Um, I'll have the, uh, Rosemary chicken, please. Great. For you? I'll have the thai pasta salad. Thai pasta. All right. It's coming right up. Who is Peter? And why does he determine what you'll have for lunch? I call him the back breaker. I'm gonna need all my strength. Oh, you're ridiculous! Don't hate me Because you are desperate and I am pleasantly scandalous. I can teach you. Mm. I just got Eric fixed. I'll just end up breaking him all over again. Besides, that karma you're playing with is a bitch. No, I don't believe in karma, And I don't believe in being constrained by social hypocrisy. No, you believe in being a ho. Socially, it is fine For a man to have more than one woman, But 100 years ago, it was perfectly normal For women to date multiple suitors. Really? Let's see. You have to check your calendar Just to see who you're screwing tonight. Oh, yeah, that's real normal. Well, being with one man isn't normal. It's like wearing the same dress for 20 years. Everyone was created for someone else. Oh, really? Okay, so then why are there so many Miserable married people in the world? That doesn't mean... Women simply don't realize That they can never be satisfied With just one man. Here we go. No, I don't even give a man my cellphone number. No, that is too much access. He can call me at the office or my home or e-mail me. He is not gonna have me on a leash. You just don't want to commit, And these men are too stupid to realize it. You're an anti-monogamist. I am not anti anything. I just know that you cannot change the nature of a man, And when an opposing force won't change, you adapt, And I have found perfection. You found polyandry. Every woman needs five things... Five perfect man things, And most women settle for one or two. I want it all, And because it is impossible to find a man with all of them, I have found five... One man for each. That is so silly. It is brilliant, And the only logical solution. No, no, no, no, no. Every woman has the same dilemma... Trying to turn a man into something he's not. Okay. Tell me why you just have to have five men at one time, Besides the obvious self-serving reasons. Five... no more, no less. It is so simple, really. Every woman needs a bad boy. That's where t.I. Comes in. It's not just because they want to go against the grain. It is because you know no one is gonna mess with him. Ooh, that's my song! Man, I just want to do your homework. What's your name, huh? Been watching you, girl, all night. Ooh. Can I get your name? What's up, man? You can't beat Having your own personal body guard. He's not just a pack of meat. He is always there when you need him. Thank you, t.I. You're welcome. I'm gonna just stick around here just in case y'all need me. Just... let me get over here. Just... oh, okay. Hey, muscle is not enough. Eventually, you're gonna have to talk to him. The hell I do. Pshh, I don't even have to sleep with him. He is enamored just by being with me. Mm. And of course, there's romance. Oh, every woman needs romance... A man who is so smooth, so sugary sweet, Every phone call leaves your face sticky. Mm! Look, this is what James sent me this morning. "I am but a fish caught in your net", "Longing not for the release, "But to be devoured by your grace. "While I burn over the fire, yes, but I say let it burn. You are more than worthy of the pain." Oh, this is really sad. Please, don't hate. Why are you playing with this man? I am not playing with him. It is a mutually-beneficial arrangement. James has a need to be romantic. It's in his DNA. Most women would question his manhood, But I am evolved enough to appreciate his softer side. Yeah, that's only because Somebody else is banging your head against the headboard. Shh! Keep it down! What? Not like you're ashamed. No, but discretion is the key. What about the other three? Okay. Then there's intellect. Mm. The pillar of social accomplishment And the mental stimuli to hash out political rhetoric. It's a ridiculous notion, really. I mean, their failure to gain bipartisanship Will ultimately lead to an independent nation. How can you say that? Republicans and democrats have to eventually agree On the foremost issues to maintain government. Hailey, it's never happened and it never will. Antidisestablishmentarianism will never die. Disproportionableness, incomprehensibility. It's absurd. Damn, you're sexy. Then there's provision... The money man. Now, he doesn't have to be rich. Just well-off enough to meet your needs. You make great money. That doesn't mean I want to spend it. Wow. You look absolutely stunning this evening. Thank you. You're gonna be the most beautiful woman At the opera by far. Oh. Oh, wait, I think I-i lost an earring. Why not wear these? Really? They're beautiful. They're trinkets. We're just getting started. I was thinking, after the opera, We could helicopter over to catalina for the weekend. Uh, but I-i didn't pack anything. Oh, I took the liberty Of having hailey's personal assistant, Uh, do a little shopping run. The bags are in the car. That is so sweet. Mm. But next time, I would really like to do my own shopping. Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm. One minute. Worthington. Yes, sir. Fuel up the jet. We're going shopping. Paris. Right away, sir. You look beautiful. Oh, right. Then the best one of all... Seduction. That would be Peter. Finally, the wonder horse of the bunch. Are you kidding? Oh, this man is a master Akin to the greatest magicians spread throughout history. This man, you have met before. I don't think so. Think about the last time You did something you never thought you would. - No! - Yes, that man. Oh, I'm late. I got to go. I'll have to finish this education a little later. Okay, just remember one thing. Compromise begins and ends in disappointment. Ciao. Oh. Oh. Uh-huh. Wow. Oh. That was... Better than "hip-hop abs." Am i... Am I glowing? Am I glowing? Damn, yes. This time, I wrote my name on there. Whoo! One more? - I see you. - Hailey: I see it. I see it. Mm-mm. Ah! Phew. Oh. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Everything okay? Everything's perfect. Shouldn't you be getting ready for work? I took the night off. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. That's nice. Mm. Hmm. - I am so, so exhausted - Peter: I have so much work to do tomorrow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So... I've been thinking. Mm. About what? You. Why not you? Why not me what? Why not... you? I think this is The right thing to do. I didn't... oh! Okay! Are you out of your freakin' mind?! - Okay, here's the... - Get out! - But I thought that... - You that what, That this was w-w-what, "little house on the freakin' prairie"?! Ow. Okay. Okay. Now, look, okay? Do you know what you've done? Yeah, I've... Oh, okay. Okay. Do you know what you've done? Uh, yeah. I... I've gotten my nose broken. Do you know how much work It takes to fill a spot with the right guy?! Ow. I don't know about any spots, so... - You knew what this was. - Yes. No. And you had to go and get some grand idea - of affection off Shakespeare! - Ow! Ow! I... i don't really read Shakespeare. I thought we had something special! - Uh... ow! - Get out! - Please... okay! - Get! Get! Get out! All right, all right. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I just don't understand. You don't understand a man falling in love with you? Well, it's not that. He's not that guy, you know? He's seduction, a Booty call, the sheet master. What the hell. "The sheet master"? Whatever. Look, you know What do you expect? Things don't just stay in a tidy, little box. Oh, well, they should. You know, he should be grateful. It's what ever man wants... Sex without complications. Apparently, that's not what every man wants. And then there were four. Actually, three. - I had to let my money guy go. - Why? He filed bankruptcy. Oh, damn. You're sick. Mr. wu, thank you for your patience. Mr. wu, your company will most certainly benefit From an ongoing partnership with our firm. We can handle all of your recovery needs, From simple account reconciliation to litigation. Interpreter: Mm. Mr. wu is intrigued. That's wonderful. Mr. wu would like these issues To be resolved in-house, without costly litigations. We always try to avoid litigation. However, as a last resort, My father is a well-respected civil attorney. We are offering you, essentially, a one-stop shop For your recovery needs. Interpreter: Hmm. Mr. wu is a bit concerned with the methodology. He has heard some very disconcerting rumors. Let me assure Mr. wu that my daughter is n... Why don't we just quit the charade, Mr. wu? Your business has over $30 million outstanding From your clients. You need your money, which means you need my services. Not only do you need my services... You want my services, don't you? Hire her. Shelly will bring in the paperwork. Interpreter: I don't need much, all right? I know. Can I talk to you for a moment? And I promise every moment we share... Now. I'll call you right back, James. What's going on? Hailey, you have got to stop this. What do you mean? You know what I mean. This is not a game, sweetheart. Sure, it is. It is always a game. You know, Barry came to me earlier, Complaining to me about you stealing his accounts. Dad, I have landed and closed more accounts In this office than anybody else combined, Including you. That is why you made me partner. And Barry couldn't close an account if... Honey, baby, being good At doing the wrong thing Does not make it the right thing. Did we get the account? Yes, we got the account, but at what cost? To everything great in life There is a cost, isn't there? Oh! Oh! So now you think quoting me makes your behavior okay. Smile, daddy. It's a good day. Mwah. Now, is this the dossier? Yeah, it's all there... Copy of his passport, credit-card statements, Dun's reports, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. You know, Christopher is drowning in debt. And, sweetheart, there is a very clear and distinct line here. Do not cross it. Watch me do what I do. I'm not sure that's something A father should see. To summer... then rain... Is the greatest achievement this life can bring. So let me suffer so I may rain deep inside of you Until you are glazed with my affection. Hailey, baby, Let me know where you're gonna be tonight And I'll come check on you. It's t.I. Hailey. Matthew. Gingrich is announcing his candidacy on CNN tonight. It's gonna be absurd, of course. Hey, uh, one second. Excuse me, can I have another Martini? Hey, baby. I want to drink your bath water. Ugh! You know... What are you doing here? Closing my five. What happened - to your old number five? - Jonathan: Really, by now, you should know That your five is in a constant state of change, all right? In chapter eight, I explain, "You got to be like water, right?" You got to just flow with the energy of your five. Okay, look. I am working right now, so I need you to go. Working? Oh. O-o-okay. That's you? Yes, so please leave. Okay. Okay. Okay. Ugh. You know what? I was just coming to check on my big sister, But not no more, all right? - Be nice to him. - Bye. Bye. I'll call you back. Love you too. Little kiss. You just jealous. Uh-huh. You ain't got to be jealous. Go and play your game. Fi... Oh, God. What has happened while I was on the phone? Look what God done donated to the men on earth. Look at that. Look at that. Come on, sans. Come on, man. Damn! Sans. Hey, hey. Excuse me. Drooling. Playboy. - What? - Come on, man. You promised, man. It's not about the girls tonight. It's about the fellas, all right, pool, business. I know what I said, okay? 'Cause I was there when I said it, all right, brother?

How do you know that's the one I'm talking about? You don't know... You don't know which one I'm talking... I might be talking about the other one. I like my women conservative sometimes, brother. Conservative? Yeah, I do like a conserve Every now and then. Okay, no, I'm not talking about her at all, But the other one is fine, though. Ain't she bad? Damn! Sans, I'm on hiatus, all right?

You just want to tell everybody Where I met my wife at? Huh? You... we was walking past the nasty rhino. You pulled me in there, okay? And she wasn't dancing at all. Yeah, she was practicing, But she wasn't damn dancing, okay? You play too much, man. Look I'm just saying not for me. I'm not meeting my wife in a bar, So I'm just focused on pool. You prejudiced. I never thought I'd say it, man. - How do... - You're preju... What would Martin think right now? You think he would march for this bullshit? Listen, man.

I'm not getting married. What do you mean you're not getting married? Why should I get married And tie down all of this goodness? Why should you, indeed, sister? Ma, you know marriage is an antiquated, Simple-minded notion for needy people. You know what? God made women specifically to belong to a man... one man. Solomon had many concubines. You know, men were also circumcised with sharp stones. You sure you want to long for those good old days? I just don't think there's a man out there for me. Then, honey, Why do you always keep dating? I date for pleasure. Hey, there's nothing wrong with that. - I like that. - Right? Ew! Ew! Yes, there is. Now, hailey, I did not raise you to be, You know, shuffling your goodies from one man to the next. No, you raised me To be strong and independent. Yes, but being independent Does not mean being devoid of morality. Well, whose moral compass Should I be following? Yours? Dad's? Society's? Jesus'. Ohh! Oh, my. This is not baseball. Hey, a hit is a hit. Ask Serena. Shush. Look, every decision you make now will matter later. Now, bill, can we please try this again Because I have got to get my sexy back? Absolutely. All right, ready? Here. Put those over there. You don't have a choice, Chris. Sans, we always have a choice, okay? And I'm making it. We're choosing to do the right thing. 12:00. Everybody grab some food. Lunchtime. Now let's change the subject, man. How are you just gonna bail on me like that last night? What, I didn't bail. You gave me the signal. You said, "get out of..." I saw your signal. Man, that was foul. That's crazy, man. We've been friends since we was 10 years old, And you was gonna roll out on me like that? What about the time when you...? When I what? It was me, you... The time you did something. You know you did something. I don't even know what you're trying to say, man. What's wrong with you? You ain't got nothing to say? This... this is a first. I've been... I've been lying to you. About what? Me and Roxanne. We're not just separated. I filed for divorce. Divorce? What... what... when? A few months back. It... it's embarrassing. I didn't even tell my mama. You know I tell my mama everything. Why? Nothing. It's just... we broke up. Things got crazy. You know what I mean? We got divorced. People get divorced. She kept on eating all my cereal, And then she'd mess with the remote And she cheated And she drove my car and took all the gas. - Who does that? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up. You said she used the remote, and then what? After the remote, Then she cheated. A player got played. "A player got played"? That... that... that... that... That... That's your Dr. Phil moment right there? "The player got played"? It should have been Debbie the whole time. I told you I love Debbie. Remember? I used to call her "little Debbie." We ate the little Debbie snacks. Yeah, Debbie had four different baby daddies. And you cheated on Debbie. Look, this was not my girl, man. And it's not about me, anyway. What's it about, then? It's about you. Cuz, you live in two extremes. It's one thing or the other with you, man. You need to find some... Some middle ground. Last year, you're, "I need to be engaged. I found my soul mate in Sandra." You bought her two engagement rings. "The love is gonna last two lifetimes." Remember all that? And this year, you a damn monk. I don't need to worry About women, okay? Women... they're not vulnerable anymore, okay? They're not honest. All right, man? They're just full of games. I ain't got time for games. I remember when girls were honest. You mean back when Eve bit the apple? Women ain't never been honest, man, And, Chris, everybody plays the game. Yeah, well, I'm done with games, man. - I don't play them no more. - Everybody plays the game, - Chris. - Oh. Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry. Am I interrupting something? What the hell? Yeah, yeah, I know. What... what... What are you doing here? Well, I was just in the area And thought I would... drop by. You was just visiting another, Um, neighboring warehouse? Wait, wait. How... how... How did you know where we worked? I mean, how do you know my last name? Gyrate media. I googled you. She googled you. That's not scary at all. Well, anyway, I was just wondering If maybe you wanted to get some lunch. Well, actually, Uh, sans and i... We have lunch plans. We have to discuss a couple things. - Oh. - No, actually, I'm cool. We just discussed all the business we need to right now. 'Cause I got things to chase, right? Hmm? Do you know what a signal is? You ever see somebody give a signal? 'Cause you ever see somebody give a signal like...? Do you like monk food? I don't know what that is. He'll tell you. Oh. - So? - Lunch? Why don't I take you to lunch? Oh. Are you sure you're not gonna have anything? No, no, no, please. Go ahead. I-I never eat lunch. Really? Really, I, uh... thank you. I just need time to take the mental break. Hmm. So, what do you do professionally? Uh, I work for an accounting firm. Really? Which one? Oh, it's just a-a small firm. Oh, I'll definitely have to keep you in mind. I'm looking to move some things around financially. Oh, I'm sure I can help. So, seeing anyone? Christopher: The dreaded question. Isn't it, uh, a little late to be asking that? No. Not at all. We're still above lying. Uh, what do you mean? Lunch, not dinner. Iced tea, not wine. Aha. I see. No. No, I'm definitely not seeing anyone right now. That's a big clich. What do you mean? Oh, I mean, a handsome guy... Polite, respectful, playing hard to get. Oh, you... You think I'm playing? It's the oldest game in the book. - Yes. - No, no. No, no. No, no, no games. You... you definitely got me all wrong. Do I? - Yes. - Hmm. Hailey, I'm just, um... I'm waiting for someone special. I see. So, um, what does this mystery woman look like? Uh, well, she's, uh... She's definitely unassuming and can pump her brakes. Yeah, but she's also very well put together, Unpretentious, But definitely self-assured, Not afraid to laugh, Who knows how to handle her business. Uh-huh. Sexy, but not slutty. Intelligent, but not nerdy. Seduceable, but not... gullible. Right. This is a mistake. I am so sorry that i... wasted your time. Mistake? What do you mean? Every woman deserves to be pursued, And if I'm not worthy in your eyes, Then I-i wish you well. Wait, wait, I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... I wasn't trying to, uh... You weren't trying at all, And I'm sure you get every woman you want With very little effort. But I'm just not that girl. Here's my number in case you ever need that accounting help. Wait. I-i-I'm such an idiot. Hailey, I-i-i... I wasn't trying to insult you. It's okay. I'm just far too vulnerable not to have those feelings returned. Take care. All right, Shelly.

Now that you have me A party to this mess, what is this plan? I can't tell you the plan. You know what, I don't have time for this shit. I have an inside scoop, okay? He's co-mingling funds. He used investment money last year To save his house when the market tanked. How do you prove it? I don't have to. He knows it's true. And all I have to do is get him on tape admitting it.

Oh, you shouldn't be. Have a seat. I have something special for you. Oh, snap. Wow! I have to admit, I am impressed, Mr. Michaels. Well, I figure you'd enjoy him A lot more than me strumming On the five chords that I know, so... Isn't that romantic? What do you have against romance? Nothing. It's just overrated. How's that? Because it only leads to one thing. Sex? No, rehab. The same thing that will make you laugh Is the same thing that will make you cry. Okay, you have a point, But if you've never loved, you've never lived. Yeah, if you say so. I say so. So, sans, I hear that you are quite the investor. I do what I can do. Yeah, sans, and I also hear That you just got out of a marriage. Isn't it a little too soon to be jumping into the sack? Who says I'm trying to do that? Oh, I can see it in your eyes. You men are all the same. Sybil, don't be rude. Maybe I should get us all some drinks. It's cool. No, no, actually, you're absolutely right. Yeah. I knew it. Is that a crime, though, huh? That I look at you and see all that a woman should be? I mean, you're beyond beautiful. You're sexy. You're confident. You could dress it up or keep it loose. And you have the body of a goddess, And not to mention those eyes... Those eyes, girl. You could stop time with one glance. So what kind of man would I be If I didn't try with every morsel of my being To make you mine? So all you want is sex? No. I want it all. You only asked about sex. Well, I'm, uh... I'm starving. We should probably do these shots so we can order. All right, to new friendships and to... And to romance. You can put your roses in this when we're done with it. I didn't mean eye contact with you when I said "romance." Hope I didn't look at you, Chris. It felt weird for a second. This is good. That's that top shelf right there. I'm glad he went and got it. I I wouldn't have bought y'all that one. Teach you how to, you know, make a salad. So I'm gonna do this. Christopher: I'm gonna do this. Now you go get the avocados. You put the whole one...
