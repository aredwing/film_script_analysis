The crystal was his earthly domain from which he gained his strength and power. His purpose, to search the Earth, then destroy any power that might challenge him. You think you have power? I'll show you power! But one day, to his horror, he discovered a legend which boded ill for the evil force. "She will usher in an Age of Goodness. " No! But it also told of a Glowing Stone and warned the good creatures of the Earth to keep it safely hidden, for the stone would give evil the power to withstand the presence of the Swan Princess and destroy her. The Forbidden Arts was enraged to know there was a power greater than his own, until he devised an evil plan. Yes! Yes! He used his great powers to hide the truth and alter the appearance of the legend, hoping that any creatures who saw it would fear the Swan Princess. Having corrupted the legend, The Forbidden Arts searched far and wide for the Glowing Stone. But he searched in vain. As the ages passed, the legend withdrew from view. But then, one day, the paws of a curious scullion pulled it from obscurity. "In a coming day, "an evil Swan Princess "will usher in the Age of Despair "and lay waste to the Earth and its creatures. " The false legend worked on the scullions. Fearing the Swan Princess, they cut themselves off from the rest of the world, and lived in seclusion and passed on their fears for generations, just as The Forbidden Arts intended. # Look to the night and you might see her # Casting a shadow, a cloak of fear # Better beware and be on your marker # We must prepare for the day is near # Centuries later Odette, the Swan Princess, was born. Her mere presence on Earth nearly destroyed The Forbidden Arts. No. He escaped to his crystal for refuge, and from there, he frantically began his schemes against the Swan Princess. Sensing Lord Rothbart's darK soul, he drew the sorcerer to him and promised him power untold if he would destroy the Swan Princess. But Princess Odette and Prince Derek together proved too strong for Rothbart. The Forbidden Arts remained tortured by this truth. He alone could never destroy the Swan Princess. And then, fortune fell his way. What have we here? A thief! Don't kill me, whatever you are! Please! I will spare you, but you will do my bidding for the rest of your worthless life. And thus, The Forbidden Arts renewed his efforts to destroy the Age of Goodness and the Swan Princess. Hyah! Derek, don't you think... Ha! Whoa! I have a feeling everything will be... Oh, Derek! You go. She's, but... I can't see! Who's there? Who is it? Mother, it's me. So cold. It's so cold. Rogers, more blankets. No, Derek, no. If I could just hold something warm. But smaller. About eight pounds or so. Mm-hmm? About the size of a baby? I never thought of it that way, but, yes! I mean yes. So this is what Odette was trying to tell me. Mother, you've done a lot of crazy things to get me to do what you want, but pretending to be dying? Fake dying? Zat's genius! Queen Uberta, I salute you. What else am I supposed to do, Derek? Guess how many grandchildren the Queen of Wixom has? Go on, you just guess! I don't know, four? No! None! But what if she has one before me? Oh! The shame! Mother, I promise, no one wants children as much as Odette and me. Then show me the baby! Show me the baby! Rogers, a little help here. Well, I'm getting older too, you know, and I want another child to tutor before it's too late! Et tu, Rogers? Ha! Latin! Which you learned from me! But I've no one to teach now. I must teach or I'll shrivel up like an old snail! Next time you're trying to send a message, use a hammer. And sorry if... Don't be. I love your mother. Besides, I want her to have grandchildren, too. Yes! Yes! We can hear you. Picnic? I might have promised the woodcutter we'd help him today. Well, can't break a promise. I'm so cold, so very cold. You look fine to me, Jean-Bob. Yeah. Just a little green. Look, I'm dying, okay? I've got, like, 10 minutes max! Now, I'm sure zere are some maids and farmers' daughters zat would like to say goodbye to me, so go find zem, if you don't mind! Oh, no! Hey! Watson's disease. What? He's got all the symptoms. Slimy skin! Bulging eyes! No ears. We're gonna miss you, little buddy! Poor Jean-Bob. He was such a good little frog. My favorite amphibian. Why can't we do the double drop with a reverse lashing? We're master trap makers, Cutter! That's the best way to finish off the Swan Princess! No traps. You know what would be perfect? The kingpin slider with a knot turn! You're talking crazy. If we fail, the Hunter-Prince is sure to track it back to us, and then the Swan Princess would come and wipe out all the scullions. Is that what you want? Is it? Acknowledge! Acknowledge! 'Course not! Well then, you gotta stop talking traps, Jojo. Yeah, yeah. Sorry. I don't know where me mind went. No, no, no, it's okay. I don't know. Sometimes my brain... Forget about it. We've got work to do. You know, a horse just might get around that. But not the wagon and the Swan Princess, eh? Imagine! The Prince and Princess doing my work! I feel a little guilty. Well, we could raise your taxes. Huh? Pretty and funny. We'll get this delivered. You take care of that leg, my friend. Tell your sweet wife hello for us. That's not good. Ha! Really not good! Stop! Come on! Get off! Come on. Drop, baby! Fall! We really have to stop meeting like this. No, really. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? No kidding involved. Unfortunately, what you saw was actual. Mangler's gonna skin us! Negative. Positive! I can feel me pelt just peelin' off me! Just peelin' off me! Why I always gotta reel you in, Jojo? News from the bright side, we just got closer to finishing off the Swan Princess than any other master trap maker in scullion history. Yeah, but... We're not going home with our tails between our legs, Jojo. No? No. We're gonna swagger, my friend. Yeah, swagger. 'Cause why? 'Cause we done the best yet. There you go! Swing and swagger! Swing and swagger all the way home! All the way to the Great Stone, baby. If you can do it, I can do it! All right. Go get it now! You first. Get it, Jojo. That's right. Whoa! Well? Does she live? First, can I ask, you got a sharp instrument of any sort? Put him down! Who do you think you're laying paws on? A leader who knows that me and Jojo are your best chance, probably your only chance, at finishing off the Swan Princess. You call yourselves master trap makers? Ha! Long day. Well, look who's still got his fur. Me! And what you gonna do with that fur? I'm gonna swagger. Here we go. She lives. How can I deliver Odette's kingdom into your hands if you cannot destroy her? Give me another chance, Master! You have exhausted my patience. Master, no! The last time... Spare me the history lesson. The time has come for me to test my strength. To know. Yes! I've grown stronger. I can scarcely feel her presence. Guard the crystal with your worthless life. Ah, yes! What was that? That's strange. Ha! Daddy! Here, come with me. It's okay. Prince Derek is with your father. Prince Derek, I... You'll be all right. I'll take you to the castle. Take care of Alise. Promise me you'll care for Alise. I promise. Daddy. Daddy? It's okay. I will avenge this, Master. Go. Odette's kingdom, if I destroy her, will I still... Leave. You slept the night away. You must be famished. Sorry. It's one of mine. There. Do you mind? You have very beautiful hair. No! No! Father. Father! I know, Alise. I know. And I will always be here for you. I promise. Finally, I can put all these treasures back in my study! A child in the castle again! Someone to teach! Ah! When me see girl with own eyeball? In time. The poor dear has been through a horrible tragedy. Hello, my chamber of enlightenment. I have returned to fill your empty... Oh! Rogers, look at everything I found for Alise! Every girl simply must have a pony. And a quaint little doll house. A stuffed puppy, kitten and panda bear. A real puppy, kitten and panda bear! Evening clothes, daytime clothes, mid-afternoon clothes! And what girl can survive without a Marry Me, Leopold? # Far longer than for... # Recess is over! You're not allowed... The girl is mine to spoil, Rogers! No! She's mine to mold! Horsey! She's all of ours. All of ours to help. She won't speak. Oh... Oh, my. The poor dear. Alise! You've gotta try this! Let's do something fun! # Today's the day for adventure # So many things to try # Play hide-and-seek in the castle # Explore the countryside # We can throw a party for our friends # Go try on all my shoes # Have a picnic down by the water # Take in the mountain view # I don't know how to plan the day # Until I hear what you have to say # Can you give me a clue? Which one sounds fun to you? # Oh, oh! # Tell me what you're thinking # Oh, oh! # 'Cause I wanna hear from you # Oh, oh! # Tell me what you're dreaming # Oh, oh! # 'Cause I wanna hear from you # Alise, these are my friends I was telling you about. # Feels good to dance to ze rhythm # So let ze music play # Your toes will tap to the beat now # Your hips will swing and sway # Before we jam in the spotlight Whee! Just one last step # Have you ever heard of the Moon Hop? # Check out my pirouette # Do you think this could really work? # It'd take a lot to outsmart her # Can you give us a clue? Which one looks good to you? # Have you ever seen this? Puffin time # Oh, oh! # Tell us what you're thinking # Oh, oh! # We wanna hear from you # Oh, oh! # Tell us what you're dreaming # Oh, oh! # We wanna hear from you # Here, my dear The perfect broth # But it's missing something It's a little off # If it's hard to taste It's not your fault # All it needs is a pinch of # We really wanna Don't you just wanna? # We wanna hear from you # Shout it out now # We really wanna Don't you just wanna? # We wanna hear from you # Feels so good now # What do you say?

Tomorrow, we'll storm the castle and put an end to the Swan Princess. # This is the day that we've long awaited # This is the hour they foretold would come # Destiny calls as we stand united # We are prepared and we'll get the job done # Do not underestimate the Prince. He is a masterful warrior. We have a plan to deal with him as well, Master. The girl you orphaned has become like a daughter to Derek and Odette. When we snatch her up... The Prince and the Princess will surely follow. Right into the forest... Where scullions have the clear advantage. They will be no match for our master trap makers. # Hey, did you know she has snakes for eyeballs? # I once heard that she's 10 feet tall # She never sleeps Only roams in darkness # One look from her And you'll burn with fire # Bring me proof of your success, and all that the Swan Princess possesses will be yours. # She will be no match for us Her fate can't be undone # All eternity counts on us # And we'll not rest Till we get the job done # It's all right. I'm here, Alise. Everything is okay. # Dry your eyes # Everything's all right # I am here to hold you # I won't let you go # Lay your head # Let me calm your fears # You are safe forever # I'll always be here # I know there's pain # Locked deep in your heart # You feel like you're lost All alone # But just when it seems It's hard to believe # The promise of love leads you home # When the rain falls Lift up your eyes # There's a rainbow Just standing by # And the colors Will light up the sky # Bringing hope to your heart Guide your way through the dark # Where you'll find me # Always with you # Poor thing. "Plants that can heal you. " "Wart removal. Weight gain. Writer's cramp. " Hey, where's Watson's disease? "Many people consider sweet honey clover a cure-all for most diseases. " Oh! Jackpot! "But beware... " "Poisonous stink weed may cause swelling and hallucinations. " At least I'm not having hallucinations. Zat hallucination's got a good kick! Huge squirrels, Jean-Bob? And zey have blowguns! Of course they do. Well, a word to the wise, Jean-Bob. Fake dying might get you a kiss. Fake lost-your-marbles, no, that's just sad. But I really did! It's go time. Jojo's ready. And Jojo's eyes? This one's for the Prince at all times. Today, the master hunter... Meets the master trap makers! One Bavaria, three Bavaria... Wait, me forget "Two Bavaria"! Two Bavaria. Now I say, three Bavaria. Quickly! This way, Alise. Follow me! Why didn't Alise follow? No one ever finds me! Looks like you're "it. " Ollie, ollie, oxen free. Eight Bavaria. Nine Bavaria. Ten Bavaria! And go! Ready or no ready, me coming! Has anyone got a biscuit? Remember when we asked Chamberlain to find her closest relative? Alise has no relatives. I'm going to be a mom! I mean, you're going to be a dad! I mean... You've made me so happy! Kind of thought you would be. I'm going to be a grandma! In your face, Queen of Wixom! Three more seconds, Fido. Leesey no climb this! Two! My sniffer broken. One! Me give up. Hooray for Alise! Yes, yes, yes, Alise! Big flying squirrels! Big... No! No! Odette! Hold on, now. Wait till the Prince is good and gone. Alise! Last time I did zis, I got... That poor dear! To be in the clutches of those... Those things! Oh! Frosting the snowman. No one touches the Queen, you heinous hamsters! You put me down! How dare you? Take her to the village! Go! I will wait beyond your traps, just in case you fail again. Well, go on now, use him as a battering ram! But the door's unlocked. Well, it's no fun just waltzing in. Hmph. Hey, half-pint! What are those things? Where'd they come from? What they want? Never mind that! Where are we? This is the castle cellar, Uberta. You mean, when I say, "Take it to the cellar!" This is what I'm talking about? Yes. Ooh! This simply will not do! Hello? Furry person in charge? Remove me from this place! I can taste the air down here! Right. But I don't really get the point, because in the morning, we're just gonna fling ya. Fling me? That's right. For giving aid and shelter to the Swan Princess! Did you hear that? You will fling the Queen over my dead body! You'll have to go first then. Well, actually, it was just a figure of speech, really. I refuse to be flung! I just spent three hours on this hairdo! Well, I'm afraid the only way to avoid it is to "Deny your allegiance to the evil Swan Princess. " Evil? I will never deny the honest and pure-hearted Swan Princess. Right. So, tomorrow, we'll have your trial, it's more of a formality, really, with a flinging to follow directly after. And if you could wear something light and simple, so we can really get some good distance on ya. You monster! There's mold down here! Never fear, my noble Queen! Lord Rogers, Esquire, shall defend you! Thank you, Rogers. And when we win, we're going after the guy who built this cellar next. Odette! Be careful. There are traps. Okay. Odette! I see it. They're the real deal. Fools! They failed again! Watch out! Derek. The Swan Princess. Who... Shh... What? But I'm sure I hit the Prince! Well, she must've gone on alone. I'm going back to the village! Find him! He couldn't have gone far. I can't let her rescue the girl. Who... What are you? Oh, my gosh, I'm a little nervous. Okay, now those are two questions I intend to answer with absolute clarity, Princess. But first, if you'll step aside, I've just a few seconds to save your husband's life. What? A robust poison, indeed! Poison? These guys know what they're working with, but they don't know who they're dealing with. Me! Okay, now, to your first question, Princess. I am a scullion. Order, Rodentia. Family, Sciuridae or squirrel. Subfamily, Pteromyinae, or as we say in the business, flying squirrel! Please? Ah, yes. Thank you. Back to work. However, we are a very, very rare genus and species. And I'll tell you one thing we can do, right here, right now, and that's save lives. In record time, I might add. Look at that. Look at those cheeks. Okay, I think it's coming back, I think he's going to be okay. Thank you. Now, as to your second question. I am your loyal servant, Bortan Gali Gali Gumwatt Sumwatt Bing! I'll just call you Scully, if you don't mind. Scully! I see. You're very charming, Majesty. Thank you. That's brilliant. Your friends are trying to kill us! Friends? Those are not friends. I haven't spoken to another scullion in years. I was banished. Banished? Yes. It's your fault, actually. I'll tell you all about it, if you want me to. There's no time, Scully. They've kidnapped Alise. Who's that, your daughter? Hopefully someday, yes. You won't be fighting just the scullions to get her back, I can promise you that. You'll be fighting The Forbidden Arts, as well. What? If you succeeded, then where are their bodies? It's only a matter of time before we find them, Master! I want proof now. You brought her here? As proof that the plan worked. She must never leave this place. Now, go back to the forest, find their bodies and bring them back to me. Mangler has been promised your kingdom if... If he would... Yeah. And that other chap, what's-his-name, had been promised the exact same thing. You know who I'm talking about. Rottweiler, Rothlisberger... Rothbart. That's the one. Derek! So, we're up against The Forbidden Arts again. I don't know how to tell you this. There's no rescuing Alise. It's impossible. I made her a promise, Scully, and I will keep it. Well, of course, I mean impossible for a non-Swan Princess person. But for you, only next to impossible. But still! Say, "Ah!" Ah... I'll find her. Just show me the way to your village. Getting you into my village would be a little like pushing an elephant through a keyhole, I'm afraid. No. No, that would... How are you feeling? You dizzy? Sleepy. That's it! A sleeping potion! That's how we'll do it! Do what? Squeeze you through the keyhole. Charge! That's it, boys! Hold him down for interrogation. Hurt you so bad! Are you guys all right? Friends of yours, Princess? This is Puffin and Speed. I'm sorry. So embarrassed. Under my fur, I'm blushing. A secret tunnel? Well, yeah, at least I thought so. Fortune smiles! No. Ze name is Jean-Bob. And zis is a frown. The potion I'm about to make calls for frogs' eyes! No, no. Jean-Bob is also a friend of mine. A thousand apologies. You can come down, Jean-Bob. No way. He's still got zat look in his eyes about my eyes. No. It's all right. What's that? The Glowing Stone! I see it. No! Close it, Princess. Okay. Creepy. The Glowing Stone. Where have I... It's right on the tip of the tongue of my brain. It rings a bell of some kind deep inside... I'll tell you this much. It's definitely got something to do with the legend. Look at that. Princess, how did you get it to... I don't know. All I did was touch this image. But I've run my paws over this image a dozen times! Maybe two to 12... Let's just say a lot. It responds to Odette's touch because she's the Swan Princess. Of course. That's it. Why didn't I... You really believe that I... Will usher in an Age of Goodness? I've already seen it happen. Okay, she's special! But next time, Odette, don't touch ze button zat makes ze frosty, freaky light show! The amphibian's right. I'm afraid that frosty, freaky feeling is The Forbidden Arts. Frightening fact, says ze fearful frog. Unless I'm wrong, and let's face it, that's rare, last time was early in the Age of Confusion, The Forbidden Arts wants this stone. Really? What can it do? Not waiting around to find out. As my father used to say... Loose translation, run! Do that again, buster, and I'll show you how fur flies! Remember, we're playing nice. Oh... All right! I'll be on my best... You want a piece of me? On your way, cutie. I said beat it, punk! Shh... Your Honor, to the charges that Queen Uberta gave aid and comfort to the Swan Princess, we plead 100% guilty! Well, thank you very much. That puts us ahead of schedule, which I appreciate. Fling her! I'm not paying your lawyer's fee. But... Since the Swan Princess is not evil in the least degree, it follows ex-post-facto that Her Majesty is 100% innocent! I give you exhibit A! An entire village of gingerbread, which Odette made for the orphans just last Christmas! Fact, orphans are alone! Fact, orphans love gingerbread! Fact, gingerbread villages are exceedingly hard to make! Ergo, the woman you call "evil" did a very nice thing for lonely children! Now I ask you... Sorry. Insufficient evidence. Fling her! Fling her! Fling her! I'm going to die! Two! Four! Six! Eight! Who do we appreciate? Uberta! I call the witness, Bridgit! Now, Bridgit, tell us in your own words how you know that the Swan Princess is, indeed, good. Okay. So, this go back to time when knee bone give me secret message. It true! Me got special knee bone! It tell me when rain come! What you say, knee bone? A stalling technique. Well done, Rogers! Well done! By now, Derek has Alise, and he's on his way back here to rescue us. Okay, Princess, if you please, a quick review of the plan. Okay. As soon as Puffin, Speed and Jean-Bob draw away those scullions, Derek drinks this sleeping potion. The scullions find him, thinK he's dead, then take him to their village. He's in. Derek's arrival creates a diversion. You sneak in, find Alise... We give Derek this waking potion. He and I rescue Alise. Voila. And I'll keep the Glowing Stone safe. Questions? Concerns? Comments? Too late. That's the plan. Yeah, right here, never slept through a rescue before. Through the lips and close 'em tight. Swallow it down and nighty night. Now, you're sure he won't wake too soon? When it comes to potions, Highness, these paws ain't faux pas. Get it? Never mind. I mixed the potion perfectly for someone weighing 12-and-a-half stone. I hope so. I can't live without this guy. It'll all work out. So long as you promise not to come into the village. The Prince is spot on, Princess. Every scullion has been trained since childhood to destroy you. To my fake death. So, how long does it take to... Faster than I anticipated. I knew I hit him. Mangler! The one who banished you? Right. That's right, watch guards, leave your posts. Okay, Princess, just need to round off Derek's wake-up potion. You can use Puffin's eyes. Odette! No. To help spy in the village. Great idea, Princess. Here. Extra antidote. Just in case you end up on the wrong end of a scullion poison dart. You never know. Killer squirrels. Who knew? As my uncle would say, "Let's go. " Not an original thinker. Another one of his sayings was "Good morning. " Lay him out on the Great Stone. All right. Mangler's making a suspicious move at two o'clock. I'd say that looks promising. What if Scully can't find Alise? And what in the world is 12-and-a-half stone, anyhow? Your thing's ringing. Don't touch it, Odette! It'll be freaky, frozen feeling, part two! I don't think so. I think it's trying to tell me something. Huh? Look! Of... Good choice. I don't like spooky magical messages zat begin with "Beware"! Hmm. You! You remember me. I'm flattered. Say, we have a mutual acquaintance. Initials S. P.? Yeah, Swan Princess. Correct. Turns out I was right. Not evil in the least degree. But then again, you knew that all along, didn't you? So, you're the reason I couldn't find her! I do hope you'll get over it. And now, if you'll excuse me, I'm here to rescue the girl. There, I suppose. Nothing knocks out a scullion like a log to the chest. Boy, am I beat! I feel like I... Oh, yeah, drank a sleeping potion. Scully, did you find Alise? What are you wearing? I think that potion was for someone 40 stone. I'm seeing double. Or maybe it wasn't strong enough. Hey, fellas. Look, I know you might find this hard to believe. I'm a good guy. The Swan Princess is a good guy, too. Just a girl version of a good guy! All lies! Scullions! Operation Spider Web! Yeah! Finally! Not sticking around to find out what that means. Operation Spider Web. Well named. Please, listen to me! The Swan Princess... Enough yappin'! You, gather up the blowguns. You, soak the darts in double poison. And you, prepare to die. Scullions! Operation Firing Squad! That, I understand. So, Odette say to me, she say, "Bridgit... " That what she call me because my name Bridgit. Not right she call me Larry. Larry not my name! A few more minutes of this and I'll fling myself. Anyhow, this part funny, so wake up! Guilty! Queen Uberta, having heard some of the evidence, I hereby sentence you to death. I hereby refuse to die! "The only thing... " It's Speed reading, but it sure ain't speed-reading. "Beware all who live in the Age of Goodness. "Guard this stone with your life, for it is the only thing... " The only thing that what? The suspense is killing me. Really? 'Cause it sounds like it's putting you to sleep. But how are you gonna get the lass with him in there? Pretend to be Mangler, of course. But he's so... And you're so... I have the solution right here. Just needs to be properly stirred. Let me go! Re-administer anesthetic. Thank you. That's some beverage. Mangler. Derek's waking potion. Wish me luck. Good luck. Mangler! Yes, sir. I mean yes, Master. Well? Yes, Master. Good news. The Prince is stone-cold dead. Don't worry. It's okay. "It is the only thing that gives evil the power to... " You're choking me! Ze power to what? Yes, this will all be easier with the Prince out of the way. Yeah, but I'm sorry to say that... The Swan Princess lives. I know. I saw her! She was with it, Mangler. With what, Master? The Glowing Stone, you idiot! I felt it! I saw it! Find it, yes. Then I will be able to withstand her presence. And then I'll have the power... "To destroy... " The Swan Princess. Don't just stand there cowering in the shadows! Find the Glowing Stone and bring it to me! Of course, Master! Is she in there? Yes, but... Master! I'll warn Odette! You wake Derek! Right! It was the legend seeker who I once banished! What? He's helping the Swan Princess! Then it was his burrow, his hideaway, that I saw in the vision! Master, the Swan Princess is out there somewhere! But the last time you left the cave, it took months for the crystal to restore your power! I must get that stone! Princess! Where are you? Odette! Where is it? I saw the box that holds the stone! Tell me where it is! Well, normally, I like to help where I can, but no. Scullion, I will roast you slowly. Take your time, Smokey. Where is the stone? Scully! You! We are not finished. Little late, but I know why Killer Cloud wants the stone. You too, huh? So the question is, where is it? Why don't you signal your intentions? That's brilliant! You continue to impress, Princess. He's looking for it, Scully. Yes, he is. But that also means the cave is empty. I'll take you to Alise. Odette! Odette! The potion must've... Scullions... You know, Derek must've... Thank you. Derek woke up too soon! The scullions are gonna kill him! Ready! Aim! Stop! Odette? Odette, no! Scullions, ready your weapons! Please believe me, I've never meant you any harm. Don't believe it, scullions! Remember, she's the evil Swan Princess! Excuse me. Over here. There is no evil Swan Princess! There never was! Traitor! Mangler warned us about you! The legend of an evil Swan Princess, come on! It's a complete lie, and Mangler knows it! There is an evil force and he's called The Forbidden Arts. Scully! Please, if I was as evil and powerful as you've been led to believe, why haven't I attacked? My only power is that I love the girl, the child you took from me! Please! She's already lost so much. I only want to live to love her. I promise, I will leave you in peace. Lies! You got away from me once. Never again. Do it! What did the old scullion mean about The Forbidden Arts? He's a crazy fool! Fire! Fire! No wonder you couldn't destroy her. You are weak! Jojo! Jojo! I'm so sorry. Cutter? I'm here, buddy. Right here. I don't... Cutter, I can't see ya! I'm right here, Jojo. Right next to ya! I'm dying, Cutter. No! Come on, you're talkin' crazy. My only brother. This will save him! Jojo? What happened? Am I... You live to swagger another day, Jojo. You saved me? Actually... Look! Fools! You will never defeat The Forbidden Arts. Sore loser. Speed and Jean-Bob took the Glowing Stone upriver, but The Forbidden Arts is after them! He'll have to kill me to get it! What about Alise? She's perfectly safe for now. We'll get her. Go! I'm comin' with ya. The scullion army's a thousand strong, Princess. Let us help the Prince protect this Glowing Stone. Yes! But where is the scullion army? We're gonna swagger after 'em now! Fling her! Fling her! Fling her! Fling her! Fling her! Fling her! Fling her! Fling her! Fling her! Okay. We're on the home stretch. It gets dicey up there, but give me your hand and I'll help... Hurry, Scully! Come on! No strength like a mother's love. Good job, fellas. I'll keep it from now on. Hallelujah. But I still need your help. Halle-you-crazy? I've got to get this stone back to the castle where I can keep it safe. I can't do it without you. For Odette. For the Swan Princess. For the Age of Goodness! Oh, for Pete's sake! Tighter. Crank her down. Try to keep yourself ram-rod straight, okay? Flailing really cuts down on the distance. Then I shall thrash and flap about like a hooked trout! Party pooper, that's what you are. My dear Queen Uberta! If only I'd finished that last semester of law school! No, dear Rogers, it was a kangaroo court, except with squirrels. But I must tell you something, my dear Queen. Better make it quick. I love you. What? I know it's socially inappropriate, perilously presumptive, and wrong, wrong, wrong, but... Three. You love me, too? How romantic. We shall be flung together! I didn't really... Two. Uberta. Rogers! I order you to have a sense of romance! Your love is cruel! One. We've been lied to. Well, guess that's the end of that show. Go get them. We've got some new friends who need our help. All right, let's go. Princess! Scully! Please. Get Alise while you can. But you're... Go, Princess! Not giving orders, but go! Now, sit down, you! Somebody has been a very bad squirrel. Mangler! Alise! Sweetie, I'm going to get you out of there. Fire in ze hole! So, you're the big dope who lied to us about the Swan Princess! You'll never get this! There must be some way! Scullions, give me the stone, or the Prince will burn. Give it to me and I will spare him. No! Don't believe him! Let me die! Quickly, scullions. It is mine. The Glowing Stone is finally mine. Oh, no. I know, right? Let the Age of Despair begin, and let it begin here. No! Come back! Scullions, come down! Stay together now. If it is any consolation, I will destroy the Swan Princess much more quickly. I'm so sorry. I failed you, Alise. The crystal. You spoke! Break the crystal. Yes. I have waited for this moment. You see, Princess, there is no amount of goodness that can save you or anyone else. Power is all that matters, and I have it all! Age of Goodness! You thought you and your vows of everlasting love and your little band of believers would save you, but where are they now? Gone! And now you will join them. Huh? Wait! It doesn't have to end this way! Would you take my greatest pleasure from me, Princess? Let me live and I'll help you. I'll convince everyone to follow you. Please! They'll listen to me! I don't need the help of a widowed princess. No. Everyone! Over here! Thanks for the offer, but I will force them to follow. Farewell, Swan Princess, and your Age of Goodness. No! No! There you go. Good job all around. Good job. Alise! Alise! Mommy? Alise! Loyal subjects, friends! We have a very important announcement. Today, we add to our royal family. I present to you, none other than... Princess Alise! Daddy. And one for Mommy. And now a second announcement! Sweetheart, allow me to make the announcement. Dear, I make all the announcements! Technically, as king, I... You're not king yet, Bub. And even when you are king, announcements are my baby. Really? And what do I get to do as king, pray tell? If you're lucky, the checkbook. I announce that there will be no announcement! Ha! I announce our wedding's on ice! Fine with me! I don't think I can marry a woman who thinks it's romantic to be flung! # I love the way you love me The way you move me # You feel so good in my arms # I love the way you need me The way you free me # You got me right where I belong # I couldn't tell you what I was missing # I didn't know myself # Since every day I was a little bit closer # Putting my love on the shelf # But you You got me smiling # You Came and stole my heart # Now I can't imagine being without you # You turn my world upside down # I love the way you love me The way you move me # You feel so good in my arms # I love the way you need me The way you free me # You got me right where I belong # It's like a dream How it fits so perfect # Like a lock and key # You're the thing I ever wanted, needed # I've got my happy ending # 'Cause you Got me wishing on starlight # You Are the heart to my soul # You're the first part of my day A reason to celebrate # I'll never, ever let you go # I love the way you love me The way you move me # You feel so good in my arms # I love the way you need me The way you free me # You've got me right where I belong # You Part of my life Part of my life # That I've been waiting for # Now we're alone # I'm finally home # I love the way you love me The way you move me # You feel so good in my arms # I love the way you need me The way you free me # You got me right where I belong # I love the way you love me The way you move me # You feel so good in my arms # I love the way you need me The way you free me # You got me right where I belong # Right where I belong # You got me right where I belong # # This is the day that we've long awaited # This is the hour they foretold would come # Destiny calls as we stand united # We are prepared and we'll get the job done # Faster than lightning we will strike # Swift as a wind in the dead of night # You better flee when the arrows fly # We will not be denied # We are the mighty scullions # Fearsome creatures fear us # We are the mighty warriors # Here to stop the princess # She will be no match for us # Her fate can't be outrun # All eternity counts on us # And we'll not rest till we get the job done # Hey, did you know she has snakes for eyeballs? # I once heard that she's 10 feet tall # She never sleeps Only roams in darkness # One look from her And you'll burn with fire # She'll choke will her tails and head for the cakes # Are the positions she would take # We'll meet our doom if she gets her way # We're going to stop her We must destroy her # We are the mighty scullions # Fearsome creatures fear us # We are the mighty warriors # Here to stop the princess # She will be no match for us # Her fate can't be outrun # All eternity counts on us # And we'll not rest till we get the job done #
