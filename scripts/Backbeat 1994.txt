It's nothing. - Call that nothing? - What do you call it? - Filth. - That's not filth. That's art. - He says this is art. - Call that art? - Yeah, well... - That's Nancy. That's my girl. (Singer) # Don't stop... # - That's your girl? - No, never. She'd never throw herself away on shite like you. What did he say? He says you're too fucking ugly. - (Glass shatters) - # But honey, honey (Woman) Ow! (Singer) # Don't stop (Shouting) # You kiss so well my lips begin to burn Quick.

Well, here's another joke. See if you get a laugh out of this. Go! - (Thuds) - Aagh! Get off, you bastard. - Leave it, will you? Leave it! - I'll fucking kill you! You fucking killed him. (Strains and gasps) - I'll kill you. I'll kill all of you. - Oh, yeah? I'm gonna bring a crew down here and kick the shite out of you. - (Man in gang) Nancy boy! - Bastards. - (Man, distant) Fuck off. - You're all shite, the lot of ya. (Coughs) You all right, Stu? Huh... (Sniffs) How do I look? Put it this way - you'll get better, I'll always be ugly.

Look at you, you're a bloody mess. - (Door opening) - What? Cream tea, anybody? Ask him what he thinks. - What do you think, John? - Does that look like me? - Does it? - You got the tits right. - You shag her? - There's more to life than shagging Celia. - Sabrina. - Because I'll shag her for you. Don't be too shy to ask. What friends are for. - What do you think? - Do you want the truth? Please. Hanging's too good for it. - 50 guineas. - That's cheap. Don't let it go to your head. It might be ten years before you sell another one. Van Gogh never sold a picture in his life. Yes! I like the blonde but I prefer the brunette. - Blondes have more fun. - Who says? - Swedes. - It's got to look good. You'll get it for 50, you know. (Train rattling on rails) (Bells pealing) (John) Liverpool. Home of... (Stu) Liverpudlians. You know what I like about Liverpool, Mr. Sutcliffe? No. What is it you like about it, Mr. Lennon? I was hoping you'd tell me. I know what Arthur's gonna say. He's gonna say, "I gave you a chance. "I put a brush in your hand, I went out on a limb for you "and you're tossing it away to play bass in John Lennon's skiffle band." Not a skiffle band. It's a rock-'n'-roll band. - "I opened doors for you..." - It's not my band. It's a group. We're a group. We're in it together. - He's gonna shit himself. - I like Arthur. You know, he's all right. But he thinks art's something you got to hang on the wall in a pool of light. It's a disease with him. He thinks it's all about van Gogh. - Nothing wrong with van Gogh. - I had a word with him. - Did you? - Bumped into him in The Grapes. I said, "Vincent, where did it all go wrong?" - You know what he said? - What? He said, "If I could do it all again, "I'd be up there shaking me bum doing Blue Suede Shoes. "It's all dick." That's what he said. - I gave him your regards. - Thanks. You're a painter, Stu. You are the best I've got. I'm coming back. - It's a pisser to throw it away. - I'm not throwing anything away. You could teach me a damn sight more than I could ever teach you. Arthur, I'm 19 years old. I've got me whole life. - And where's it gonna get you? - Hamburg, for a start. (Whistles) Take it easy, mate. Put it up there. (Paul) Hey. - It's a bit rough out there. - It's nothing. Bit of a swell, that's all. - You call that a swell? - I call it mother's milk. My dad was a sailor, and his dad. I'm the son of a son of a sailor. Bollocks. Mum! Mum! - Here. - What is it? - Scones. I've made you some scones. - Mum, they've got food on the ferry. - They haven't got my scones. - I can't take scones. If the lads know, I'll never hear the end of it. - I'm in a rock-'n'-roll group, Mum. - (Sighs) So have you ever been abroad before? Overseas, like? Oh, aye. Yeah. Yeah, I've been to the Isle of Wight. - I'll write. - You'd better. Oh, every day. Every minute. Every second. Now and then would be a start. You're a tough negotiator, Miss Powell. (Paul) Come on, George, we're starving. - There's food on the ferry. - Where are those scones your mother makes? All right, lads. (Ship horn sounds) Shall we? (Groans) Is that right, pal? You did say your father was a sailor? (Retches violently) You did say the sea was in your blood? - (Silence) - Sorry? Missed that. I said... Oh! Ugh! You horrible filth. (As pirate) Believe I'm feeling a shade better now, but I do believe the captain's trod on me parrot, sir, arrr, arrr!

You'll be happy to know we keep our clothes on. (Silence) Er...on drums, Mr. Pete Best. On guitar, Mr. Paul McCartney. On bass, recently arrived from the dark side of the moon, Mr. Stuart Sutcliffe. And on guitar, Mr. George Harrison. He's only just on solid food. My name's Lennon. John Winston Lennon. I was named after Churchill - John Churchill, the wet fish man. Me parents were gonna call me after me father but Dad's such a stupid fucking name. (Silence) If you'd all like to line up and tell us your names. - Thank you, brother. - One, two, three, four.

I call it three nights with no sleep, too long between drinks, I call it dying for a piss. I call it a hard fucking day's night. Is he always like this? No. You'd be surprised, he can be quite bitter and twisted. What's the problem, Paul? - (Sighs) It's about Stu. - What about Stu? He just stands there. I know you can play bass better than he can, we all know that. But what Stu plays is just right. It's rock-'n'-roll. I know he's great but all he does is stand there. It's the way he stands. English! Showtime! Come on, Bruno, have a heart, we're knackered. One o'clock. Showtime. Just look at us. Look at George, he's dead on his feet. Look at Pete, his hands are fucked. Look at me, I'm knackered.

I was just testing the lighting. You don't say much, do you? Drummers don't talk. You must have noticed that. Might as well be deaf and dumb, drummers. When was the last time you heard a drummer say anything? See? You know why, don't you? I'll tell you why, cos nobody ever fucking listens. It's all dick. I could do with another Henry. It's all dick, all this. You dress up just to be noticed, to impress. - Is that so terrible? - Just to be noticed? It's all bollocks, that. It's all down to dick. Eh? So why don't we just fucking say it for a change? Never mind all the talk. Never mind all the fucking bollocks. All everybody wants is a bit of fucking dick. - Is he always like this? - Why don't we say it? - Why are you doing this? - A bit of dick never hurt anyone. Never led to war. - (Stuart) He thinks you're out of his league. - Liars lead to war. He thinks if he tried to pull you, you'd laugh. Everybody's trying to impress everybody else. I used to do it, the same thing. When I was about 15. Yeah. Yeah? I've given up trying, mate. You'll never shag her, Stu. Get that into your head. She's here with her fucking boyfriend. I don't get on my knees... - He's sorry he's doing this. - I'm not sorry! You should be. I'm telling the truth. It's the fucking truth, lad. You haven't got the balls to chat her up so you're having a dig. That's the fucking truth. You haven't got the balls because you think she's out of your league. That's what hurts, mate, isn't it? She's out of your fucking league. # Time to go home, time to go home # Andy and Teddy are waving good night # Let's go. Come on. Bollocks, Stu. Thank you. Hey, John, slow down. - He's jealous. - You think so? You hurt his feelings. He'll get over it. (Distant ship horn) - So, did you shag her, then? - She's a photographer. Klaus designs record covers. You'll never shag her, not her. Not Astrid. Not with all that lot. You know that, don't you? She's a photographer. You'd like her if you gave yourself the chance. She wants to take our photograph.

We're not that good. - You want him out. - That's not what I said. Listen, you. If Stu goes, I go. Do you understand that? No, you won't. Did somebody die? You can't do your solo spot anymore, Stu. - Why's that? - Because it's shite. Give it to me straight. Let's not beat around the bush. You happy now?

It'll be great because it's us, you see. What he's saying is, we'll be there. Yeah. I'm saying we'll be there. Oh, yeah, we'd be quite prepared for that eventuality. Wouldn't we, Paul? We're gonna be big, Sutcliffe. You know that, don't ya? I can see it coming. We're gonna be too big for Hamburg. We're gonna be too big for Liverpool. Are you listening to me?

Little Bohemians sitting around drinking Chateau Spazzo - and listening to Edith Piaf. - You don't like Edith Piaf? She's all right but she's an old woman, she's got one foot in the grave. I could never love anyone who didn't love Edith Piaf. You know my theory about art? Did I ever tell you? - It's all dick? - Exactly. - I wonder what makes you so... - So what? Such an arsehole. Practice. You are the angriest person I have ever met. - What makes you so angry? - I'm not angry. I would like to be your friend. You would like to be my friend but you cannot behave like a friend to me. You deny me. You deny yourself. It helps nobody. Nobody's any happier. It's such a waste of time. Why don't I let you into a secret, just between the two of us? I'm not angry, sister. I'm fucking desperate. I think you're jealous. Jealous? Jealous of who? Jealous of Stu? Jealous of me.

(# Rock-'n'-roll) # If you wanna hear some music like the boys are playin' # Hold tight, tap your foot, don't let 'em carry you away # Don't let the heat overcome you when you're playing so loud # Let the music intrigue you when they get a crowd # Well, if you can't dance, I know that you wish you could # I got my eyes on you, baby, cos you dance so good # (Girls screaming) (Train horn) (Brakes screeching) Come on. Rise and shine, Tonto. Come on, surf's up. Hamburgy-burgy-burgy. (People speaking German) (Station announcement in German) Breaks your fucking heart, doesn't it? I never finished this.

(# Rock-'n'-roll) # Well, you know that I love you, tell the world that I do # C'mon, pretty baby, why can't you be true? # I need your lovin', baby, oh, so bad # The best little woman that I ever had # Slow down # Baby, now you're movin' way too fast (# Out-of-tune bass notes) # You gotta give me a little lovin', give me a little lovin' # Oh! If you want our love to last # (Cheering) - (John) Thanks. - You off? Pressing engagement? - You're a bit flat. - Flat? I think it's the E string. Ask John. Oh! I'm flat? Me! That's it. Finish. - Leave it alone. - Something's got to be done. We can't go on like this. Half the time he doesn't turn up. When he does, he's in the fifth dimension. It's a waste of fucking time. I've told you before, Paul. If you kick Stu out, I'll go with him. No, you won't. You fucking won't. - You know how good we can be. - Not without me. - You won't kiss it goodbye. - Just watch me, mate. What is it? What is it between you two? - What is it? - Yeah, what's going on? - Are you saying I'm a queer? Is that it? - Oh, look. - You saying I'm a fucking fairy? - That's not what I said. - That's what you said! - He never said that. He never said you were a fairy. For Christ's sake! Will you just leave it alone? He spoke. You can't blame Paul. You act like you're not interested. - I'm not. - Bollocks. I'm not going to play in a band for the rest of me life. Paul is, you are. It's what you want. Found something better, have you? I'll let you know. I'm going to find out. - Calls for a drink, eh? - I've got to go, mate. Stu, she's just a girl. All right, she's got a bit of je ne sais fucking quoi. She swept you off your feet. But she's just another shag. She's having a bit of fun with you. She hasn't finished with you yet. - She'll get bored. - You don't know her. - She'll get tired. - You don't know me either. She'll finish with you like she did to Klaus! She's going to do it to you too! She'll fucking do it to you! Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. (# Latin-style pop with flute and drums) (Man speaking Russian) (Speaks Russian) He knows War And Peace word by word. - The whole thing? - The whole thing, in Russian. My advice - take two. What can I say? You don't need to say anything. Calls for a drink. (Cheering) You can do it. (Cheers become fainter, distorted) (Cries out) - (Gasps and yelps) - Stuart! - Klaus! - (Klaus speaks German) (Shouts in German) This has happened to you how many times? I don't know. A couple. I'm in a band. We play eight days a week. It can give you a headache. Hmm. Er... Mm... (Speaks German) A blow to the head. - You have had such a blow? - Who hasn't? Hmm. It was the pills, the speed. I'll lay off the speed. Ja. Do so, Mr. Sutcliffe. And also do this - slow down. Take your time. Life is long. You must not be in too much of a hurry. (Bicycle bell) (Astrid) Well? - What did he say? - You want the truth? Please. He said I should find a nice German girl and ask her to marry me. Oh, that's absurd. I think I've got something to offer. I've got a long way to go. I know that. I'm not trying to pass meself off as something I'm not. But I want to be a painter. I want the chance. (Speaks German) So, what do you say? # Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music # Any old way you choose it # It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it # Any old time you use it - # It's gotta be rock and roll music - (Dogs barking) # If you wanna dance with me... - I'm in! They said yes! - Oh! # ..modern jazz Unless they try to play it too darn fast # Great news! - Cyn. - Er, Miss Powell to you. Stu! I'm in. The art school said yes. Bollocks. (# Edith Piaf on radio) Who's that? That's that old Edith Piaf. Up here. I don't want a lot. The usual things. I'd like a house. I'd like babies. But all I really want is John. He's all I've ever wanted. John wants the world. - That's it. - Yes! - She wants babies. - I know. She thinks you're going to marry her. I am. She's lucky. Do you think so? - Yuck. - It's rum. - That's what sailors drink. - I'm a sailor. I'm the son of a sailor. I'm the son of a sailor's son. Tell me something, John Lennon. When you are rich and famous, when you are number one, when your name is in lights and everybody wants to be your friend and somebody asks, "Do you remember Astrid in Hamburg?" what will you say? I'll say, "She was the girl I always wanted. "The girl of me dreams. "Like Brigitte Bardot with better manners. "I might have fallen in love with her "but she fell in love with me best friend. "And that was the end of that." I love him, John. I do. Yeah. Don't we all? Paul can play bass. Paul can play bass a lot better than I can. He can sing a lot better too. He's a bit flat, you know. You don't need me, John. You never did. Yeah, but it was our band, wasn't it? - You and me, Stu. - No. It was your band, yours and Paul's. We're going to be big. You know that, don't ya? You'll miss it, Stu. You're going to kick yourself. We've got them by the throat, Stu. - You're going to be here in Hamburg. - It's what I want. It's where I want to be. "There goes Stuart Sutcliffe." That's what they'll say. "He could have been in the Beatles." "There goes Stu Sutcliffe." "He fell in love with a German girl. "He could have been in the Beatles "but he never really learned how to play."

You've got it all wrong. They'll be famous. The world's not big enough for John. All he ever needed was to see his way past me. You showed him how. I never had a moment's doubt. I love you. - I've got a surprise for you. - I don't like surprises. Everybody likes surprises. - Not me. - You'll like this one. - Not me. - Yes, you will. (Grunts) Aagh! (Gasps, cries out) Astrid! Astrid! (Astrid) Coming! Da-dah! I'm sorry. Stuart? Sweetie? No! Oh, Stu... You know what I like about Hamburg? - No. What do you like about Hamburg? - I was hoping you'd tell me. Where's Stu? Look at you. - How do I look? - Like a star. Where is he? He's gone. He's dead. - He was here? - Yes. - Just now? - He's always here. All right, everyone.
