And see that one shining up there? That's a planet. Venus. That's your mother's star. Every time I look at Venus, I think of her. There are so many stars! Because the sky is so clear tonight. You'd see even more stars in the mountains. Can we go to the mountains, daddy? Yes. We sure can. Henrik! Look at Venus. Georg? This is awesome! Here you go. What is this? Open it. Who is it from? To Georg. From Dad. Have you had these all along? He wanted you to have them on your 16th birthday. -He expects me to think about him? -He wrote something for you. When it's over, it's over. -You still remember him. -No, I don't. Why would you say that? All the pictures, the stories. No. I don't remember a damn thing. Hey What? We planned this Easter ages ago, Henrik! That comet is only visible right now! Of course I'm still going! Wait! I forgot something. -Did you bring the letter? -Was it for you? No, Georg. It was for you. Christ! Why come with that now? Ten years after the fact? I don't give a shit about that letter! Or him. Call me when you get there. Dear Georg. When you read this, I will have left a long time ago. Unwelcome guests have started sucking the vital forces out of me. This will be the last time you and I meet. I don't know what you remember of me. Maybe you don't want to remember. Do you remember our Wednesdays at the swimming pool? Or our afternoons together, When your mother was at school? -Look. -There it is. -What are you doing? -Writing a letter. To who? To my very best friend. -To mommy? -No, mommy is my true love. I get up every morning as usual. I take you to the kindergarten. Yet nothing is as before. How do you tell someone that you are dying? What are you reading? -I don't understand, -It is too advanced. But there are medicines. It's too advanced. Why are you mad at me? I haven't done... -How long have you known? -A while. -And not told me anything? -Veronika Hi, daddy. Time, Georg. What is time? As I write this, it's as if time has ceased to exist. And nothing will ever end. I have a story to tell you, Georg. That you now may be old enough to understand. The story of the Orange Girl. It could have been a perfect and normal day, like any other. If I had missed that streetcar. That was the first time I saw her. See you later. Was she that hot? She was different. In other words, she was that hot. Thanks. -Are they Jaffa? -Jaffa? -Israel. -Why did she only take one? -Don't you care if they're Jaffa? -They're probably Spanish. They taste like Jaffa. No. Overcast. Hopefully I get a chance tomorrow. Yeah. I keep you posted. Talk to you later. Bye. -Must have been the wrong wax. -I waxed your ski's. -Did it hurt? -I fell on my butt! I decided to forget about her. I stopped thinking about her. Except about once every minute. -What are you doing? -It's her! -It's her! -Who? -What's going on? -It's the Orange Girl! -This isn't you stop! -I have to get off here! It was her. She must be from some other planet, or some other time. Some other planet? Then what is she doing here, on our planet? Saving us from the monotony of life. The Orange Girl is going to save us? We should pay her back somehow, Show her around. Take her for a spin in my car, When it's ready. Roll back the soft top. You, me, the Orange Girl's hair blowing in the wind. That car of yours. Do you really think it will ever start? He's buying lunch today. -Hi. -Hi. What's in that case? A machine gun? No, it's a telescope. For looking at the stars? Does the Mountain Code say never go out without a telescope? No, I'm hoping to see a comet. The Gerasimov Comet. It was too cloudy yesterday. -It's visible once every 56 years. -So you dragged all that with you? I'm just going up to the nearest peak. -Are you skiing cabin to cabin? -Yeah. Joakim, where's Stella? Comets are balls of ice and dust that orbit the sun. Dirty snowballs. What are you waiting for, Stella? Can't the stars just be beautiful? -Bye. -Bye! Have a nice trip. Hey! -Weren't you saying at that cabin? -Nah -Are you on your own? -Sort of. -Sort of? -No one is on their own during Easter. "Never head out alone." Mountain Code rule number 8. Want an orange? No thanks! I should move on. Someone waiting for you, maybe? Some hot meteorite? Bye. -What a weirdo! -I think he's cute. Cute? I think he's cute too. CHRISTMAS CONCER IN OLD AKER CHURCH -Hi. -Hi. Have a seat. You're drinking tea? -With milk? -No. -Lemon? -Too sour. -Sugar? -Too sweet. Orange? No. What are you reading? -Goya. -Who is he? He is a Spanish painter. Very famous. Who are you? Who do you think? -I'm a squirrel. -A squirrel? Yes. A squirrel? -And then what? -She left. That's probably for the best. Now she's out of your life. I mean, this is too much Or is there something? Is something serious happening here? -Nah. No. -No? You're smiling from ear to ear. Whatever. I'm a squirrel. My ski's keep slipping. -Hi. -Hi. Weren't you just heading up to the nearest peak? I changed my mind. -What are you reading? -Eh. Nothing. -Nothing? -It's just a letter. -Do you get many letters like that? -No. It's from my dad. -Is he sailing around the world? -Not exactly. -He must have plenty of time. -No. He's dead. I'm sorry. Don't be. It happened a long time ago. I hardly remember him. What about your mom? -She's still alive. -Doesn't she think about him, either? Sure. -She visits his grave. With flowers. -Don't you? No. -Hi. -Hi. -Merry Christmas. -To you, too. I was worried I'd never see you again. But you did. Shall we? It's Christmas Eve. Angels and all that. Anything is possible. It's snowing. -What fairy tale are you from? -I'm actually quite real. I have to go. Merry Christmas. Wait! I can't bear losing you again. But I have to go home. -To your fairy tale? -No. To my family. Before they ring Christmas in? -When can I see you again? -I don't know. -How long can you wait? -I don't know. Do I have to wait? Yes. You have to wait. Five minutes? You have to be able to wait for six months. Six months? Why? That's just the way it is. Sometimes in life we have to be able to wait, OK? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Jan Olav. Jan Olav? Did you see that? We have this thing. I give you the world's most patient man. Are you going to wait for that comet all night? -No, not all night. -But tonight is your last chance. Yeah. May we join you? Sure. -Have you had that telescope for long? -I inherited it from my dad. This is ridiculous! What is it about? That letter? A girl he once met, that he's searching for. The Orange Girl. The Orange Girl? Can I have a look now? Hang on. -Wait! Stop! -I can't see anything. -Stella, are you coming? -In a minute! Screw you and Microscope Boy! Take it easy! You almost broke it. By the way, don't worry about Joakim. I got used to it ages ago. He's like that with everyone. He just wants to keep an eye on his little sister. -Does he need to? -It depends. -Anyway, comets. -Don't lean on that. Why do they have tails? When a comet comes close enough to the sun, - - it starts to melt. And it trails a bunch of sand and gravel. That's what looks like a bright tail. What about shooting stars? Shooting stars are - - so that you can make a wish. -Good luck with that comet. -Thank you. What is it with you? Are you stressed out about your finals? Or is it still that Orange Girl? She's forgotten about you. Six months? No one remembers that long. Forget about her. Hi. -How's it going? -Huh? With me? With the Orange Girl. And that guy who's searching. -Does he find her? -I don't know. Relax. We have a fortune in empties here. Let me just check if that gasket has come. Dammit. Not today either! Seville? Do you know anyone in Seville? "Can you wait a little longer?" -What is it? -Give me that! We're room-mates. What's yours is mine! -It's from her! -The Orange Girl? -I have to go there. -What are you talking about? You can't go now. Your finals are in four days! Finals in four days! What's the best way to find someone? Sit in one place and hope she'll show up, or move around from place to place? If two people are meant for each other, wouldn't they eventually find each other anyway? What do you think, Georg? Is everything that happens part of a larger plan? Or simply a succession of random occurrences? Hi. Hi. I've been looking for you. I asked you to wait. All fairy tales have rules. Which rules applied to this fairy tale? -What were those oranges for? -What did you think? I thought maybe you had a vitamin deficiency. I was going to paint them. Why not just buy one, and paint it several times? No two oranges are alike. That's why you are here now. Did you come all the way here just to meet some Woman? Some random woman? Exactly. How did that guy at the caf know who I was? He has seen one of my paintings, I think. A painting you painted here? Of me? Where has he seen it? Jan Olav. How do you know my name? And where I live? Do you really not recognize me? No. Help me. Give me a hint. How many squirrels have you known? I'm a squirrel. Is it you? Of course! We were inseparable. Why didn't you just tell me? I wanted you to rediscover me. The way I am now. Today. Do you believe in everlasting life? In life after death? No. We are a product of cosmic dust. It's a miracle we exist at all. -We are only here this once. -But that time is now. -I want to be here forever. -Nothing is forever. I believe that the moment is the only eternity there is. -Where do you live? -At a hostel for young girls. -Catholic. It's lovely. -Wow. A convent? A fortress. No boys can get in there. That sounds great. No, I'm kidding. -It's impossible. -Do we have to sleep? -I have to leave tomorrow. -What? Why? -Physiology finals in two days. -And you're here? What did you say about eternity? That the moment is now? Did you see that? The shooting star? That means we can make a wish. It can also mean that someone's going to die. Imagine how brief a human life is, Georg. It takes billions of years to create a man. But only a matter of seconds to die. I LOVE YOU I love you. Mom. Stella. The sky is clearing. Do you want to come out? -Look! -It's freezing out here. -Think we'll see that comet? -With a little bit of luck. Are you the lucky type? Maybe? How about your dad? Did he get lucky with the Orange Girl? Did they end up together? The Orange Girl was, or is... She turned out to be my mother. Now. Now I know why she never found another man. True love lasts forever. Nothing lasts forever. Wow. Awesome. Let me see. Move! You have to let me see. Holy shit. Wow. -Did you make a wish? -Mhm. But it's a secret. How about you? Maybe. I've got you now. -Are you allright? -Sure I'm fine. Just a little wet. -Want to go back to the telescope? -No, I think I head inside. -How far is the train station? -You need a couple of hours. -Are you leaving? -Yeah. I have to go home. I'm catching the 11 o'clock train. You only came for the comet, after all. I'm glad you got to see it. Hi, Henrik. Yeah, it was incredible. Awesome. You should have been there. Thanks. -Bye. -Bye. We got married that summer. Some felt that was much too soon. But we had no time to lose. Imagine that you could choose if you wanted to be born. But you would know that your life would only last a few short moments. And the better it would be to live, the worse it would be to die. What would you choose? Hi. Are you home already? I was expecting you tomorrow. -This is Jrgen. -Veronika has told me all about you, Strange that. I haven't heard shit about you. -Georg. -Shut up. Shit! Georg! Georg. -Open the door! -How long have you known him? A while. That letter was one long declaration of love for you. Orange Girl, my ass. No matter what you might think. I loved your father. -He was the love of my life. -The love of your life? What about that other jerk? The love of your life, number two? How many do you intend to have? Dad wrote about how he did everything to find you. You won't find love like that again, mom. Ever. No, Georg. But is there only one star in the universe? I didn't choose someone else over Jan Olav. He died from me too. -Hi. -Hi. Here. You probably want to read that. Thank you. Remember I said I didn't remember anything about him? I thought I had forgotten him. But. Suddenly. I saw something. It was perfectly clear. And it happened right here. On a night just like this. -Daddy, I can't sleep. -Come here. See that star over there? That's Sirius. And there? That's a constellation. That's the Big Dipper. And over there? That's Venus. Every time I look at Venus, I think of your mother. There are so many stars. Are you going to die? We are all going to die. I'll be sad, when you die. Let's go fly! Up you go! Mom? Do you know what that one's called? That's Venus. Everytime dad saw that, he thought of you. What are you thinking? That we only live once. And that's now. Ripped and fixed by Gavie. Revised by filmtiger.
