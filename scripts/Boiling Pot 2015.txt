It doesn't serve me. What? My memory. I don't know what was real and what I think I saw. I'm not sure that there's a difference. You weren't there. You didn't see what I saw. You're basing your information off emotions. Even if I am. He got there after it happened. I don't think you're understanding the situation. As insensitive as it may sound, it's not my problem. Look. I just need more time. More time? You realize what that tells me? Did you see what happened out there? I just need a minute! So take a minute. It's just hard to believe it all comes down to skin color. I mean, we're an educated society. It's 2008 for Christ's sake. It just doesn't make any sense. It's politics Garret. Why the hell would it make any sense? Well, it's not all that complicated either. Your mother's complicated. You fill out my absentee ballot? Yup. Congratulations on your first vote! Wooh!

I was just wondering if you guys had heard anything about that. Yo any of you guys hear about a rope hanging from a tree? Alexander you hear about this? Sorry man. Wish I could help.

Are you serious? Do you know what kind of material this is? This is husband material. Hey Bobby! Tonight! Tomorrow. Not tomorrow! Tonight. Just later. Okay? Don't talk politics okay? Especially not with my dad. You think I'm going to insult him or something? Let's see how do I say this? You're not exactly the best at being politically correct. Well, we're not all poli-sci majors are we? That's right. Dean's list baby. Yeah dean's list. Which reminds me, I'm taking you next week to go register. Yeah, about that. No. I'm not gonna vote, okay? We're just gonna register. I'm not gonna vote unless I get the free ice cream. Okay. Convince me. Okay. It is said that a weakened sense of responsibility... does not actually weaken the fact of responsibility. Okay... Are you seriously not voting? Look I just don't wanna watch two rich guys debate and then jump on a bandwagon. Smart people don't do that. Great. So when all the smart people think like you... who does that leave to vote? You. I can't vote for all of us. Aw sure you can. Okay, you keep this in your fridge to keep your food fresh. It makes things rise when you bake. Baking soda. Um, pure sodium bi-carbonate. Na H CO3. Nice. Okay, this is an easy one. You use it to sweeten your drinks. You put it in tea. Honey. But that's not a compound. So... Honey? How old are you? That's what I put in my tea. Alright what does everyone else in the world use? How you get so fly. Jesus. Sugar. C12 H22 O11 You got it. Nice. Honey? Good Lord man! Sorry that's mine. Yo what is this? Are you competing for that? I'm not competing. I'm gonna get it. That's awesome. That's a ton of money. And if you win, you can always use it to... Dude! Thirty thousand dollars? Please help yourself to the middle of my sentence! Well you know my dad's been looking for a job... for a couple of months and I thought, you know, this might help him out a bit. So, you know we'll see. Sir. It is declined. I have other customers to help out. I told you. If it don't work, I can get you another one. I can't accept any other payment sir, I'm going to have to ask you to step aside. Are you kidding me? I go to school here. Man, just hold on a second. Woah, hey man get your hand out of your pocket. Hey! You heard the guy. Let's keep it moving a little bit Wha-pish! I said why don't you take your stolen credit cards... and go to the fried chicken place down the street, alright? So what's up man, you got a problem with me or what? Hey, hey, let me take care of this for you alright. Look man I don't need this right now. No it's fine. I got it. What's your problem man? Out of my way nig-nog okay? Alright? You know what? Alright alright! Get out. All of you! You too. Now! Get out. You three too. Leave. Now get out. Are you serious? Leave! Yeah, I'm fine. Jesus. What's up? Fifteen pages on the elasticity of macro-economics. We were supposed to meet in the grad library. Dude. I am so sorry, you wanna come in? Miss Torrance? Thank you for waiting. Dean Marison will see you now. Thank you so much for meeting with me Dean. I know that you're extremely busy. Not at all. This is why I'm here. Yes sir. Um, I guess the problem now is that students are feeling offended by the events that are happening on campus, especially the noose hanging Valerie. Make sure you get all this. Listen miss Torrance, the situation is bad. It's bad for the students. It's bad for the university. It's bad for everyone. I want you to know that the administration... and myself deeply condemn these actions. To teach people and help them grow out of their ignorance. That's the role we play as educators. Okay what the hell does this mean? "Obama's presidency would be the camel's nose. " What are you reading? It's my homepage. It's the news page. An old Arabian proverb states if... the camels nose enters the tent... his body will soon follow. I feel like I should be offended by something here. What's her name? Buggle. Yo, watch it, she's slippery. You know the French eat frogs like this. Yeah? Yeah. Boiled frog legs. Miss Buggle would be a real delicacy over there. Sounds gross. And painful. Some French cooks found that if you put a frog in water, It'll just sit there and enjoy the drink. But if you start slowly turning up the heat, the frog will fall asleep. Turn up the heat a little more, it'll fall into a deeper sleep. Eventually the water's boiling, and Miss Buggle is dead. That's how you go from a live frog to a meal. That's what they mean by the camel's nose. They're wondering how this guy whose ancestors came over... to this country chained up on a boat... ends up running for president. You gonna take that? No, that's fine. It's 8:30. Let's get started on this paper. Dean. Off the record, are we just going to let these guys go? Off the record, Rose, let who go? We don't know who did this. Of course, we know who did this. You and I both know exactly who did this. Are you suggesting the Kappa House is responsible? So you do know. What I know, Rose, is that college students love spreading rumors. These are not rumors dean Marison. The Kappa House has a history of racism... that everyone seems to acknowledge except... As a results of recent tensions, we have instated mandatory diversity training for all campus organizations. And that is gonna do what exactly? Valerie, would you please? The administration cannot charge a group of students... with a hate crime without substantial evidence. Dean. This is a threat to every black student on this campus. I can understand that, Miss Torrance. We're going to explore every possible means by which we can find out what happened. We'll set up a safe space... With all due respect dean. There is a noose hanging from a tree in your safe space. We don't need to explore what happened. You and I know exactly what happened and who made it happen. We can't know anyone's intention Rose. It's not fair to misjudge people... just as you wouldn't like to be misjudged. I would think someone like yourself would understand that. Dean. Do you want me to keep typing? No. Thank you for your time. Miss Torrance. I want to assure you there is no need to worry. This is an isolated incident. Hey what'd he say? Rose, come on what'd he say? You okay? Rose! One minute Trey. Take a break. Take a break Time! Alright, we're gonna... work our inside counter-punch drill. If I throw my left hook too wide, you shoot it straight right down the middle. Got it. Okay. Nice, nice. Yeah money! Okay, alright. Now, when you feed that right hand, you better be ready to defend yourself, alright? Alright. Keep your hands up! I let you have that man. So how come your girl don't come see you fight no more? Because I don't wanna embarrass you like this every time. I know you got this ego thing going man. In the ring, I want you to be confident, not cocky. Cocky will get you killed. Alright? You need to watch some Rocky or something, and learn how to coach! Rocky? Man you leave the coaching to me. I got this. You be ready to practice this weekend and bring your A-game. It's the only game I got man! Man what'd I just say? I can't believe you talked me into this. It is cold and wet out here. Yo, don't even worry about it. Let's go. It's beautiful though. Yeah, it is. Hell no dude you ain't touching this. First we're trespassing now, you have a weapon. What are you doing? Yo, Relax. It's not a weapon. It's a baseball bat. What are you going to do with a bat and a football anyway? You poor ignorant souls. Batter up! Swing batter, batter, batter! My goodness! That one's outta here folks! Get money, get paid baby. It's okay, you can smile. When all the doors are closed, when you feel like you're carrying the world on your back, it's easy to forget that you're just a kid. You know I almost drowned as a little kid? HAZEML Drowned? So I almost never met you Yeah. I almost died. Wow. Well did your life flash before your eyes like they say? Actually, when something goes wrong, your brain usually deals with it by... trying to find a similar situation. So, when you touch something hot, what do you do? Pull my hand away. Because your brain knows if you don't pull your hand away, This happens in your brain all the time... without you realizing it. You making all this up? No, I'm not. That's the case when you're dying. Your brain knows that something is very, very wrong. But your brain has never died before. So it frantically searches through all your memories until it can find a similar situation... and hopefully save you. But it can't. So before you die, your life actually does flash before your eyes. I think we should see other people. Ha-ha. They don't teach you that in med school, do they? I wonder what I'd see flashing before my eyes. But I'd rather look at life with a more positive outlook. Yeah? How's that? Well. we can build our future home, for example. Okay. You wanted palm trees out front, right? Look! I found us a pet. The hell is that? It's a starfish. Yeah I can see that. No seriously. Valerie, I'm not kidding, I'm serious. I'm not scared, it's got these suction... Valerie I'm not playing anymore. Quit playing. Alright fine. You wanna handle this like men? You wanna take this outside? We are outside. Well then we're efficient people aren't we? Yes, we are effecient people! I'm too fast for you, actually. I'm so pretty, I'm so pretty. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. I'm the pretty one in this relationship, okay? Give me a break. Alright, give me your left hook. This is my right hand. Here is a left hook! Right hand? Fine! Give me a left hook! My left! Whatever, my left! Okay, get ready. You can't punch me back! Why not? You actually punched me! I'm not punching you 'cause you don't wanna get punched! I got you! Come on, come on! Comin' up, comin' up! Come on! C'mon! Yo! Hey! Hey! Look man! I need all your attention. Get up in here. What's your problem man? This is my problem! What is this? "Compton Cookout. Join us for a Nigga Night. " What? What the f... "In honor of celebrating our black classmates, the Kappa House cordially invites you... to its very first Compton Cookout. All dudes should be rocking jerseys, anything FUBU, Ecko, Jordans, or Dunks. Ghetto chicks should have gold teeth, start drama, and... wear cheap clothes. They look and act like Shenaynay and speak loudly while rolling their neck and waving their finger in your face. The Kappa House is proud to house this monstrosity and experience the various elements of life in the ghetto. We'll be serving 40s, kegs of dat purple drank, chicken, Kool-aid, and of course watermelon. So come one, come all. And join us for a party to be remembered, or not. " This is ridiculous. Kappa House is off campus. They can have any party they want. There's no way we can cancel it? So we're just not going to do anything? We're going. What time is your fight Saturday? Six, I think. And you want me to come to this one? Hell no. Fine, have it your way. I'll probably end up going to that frat party then. Valerie why would you go to that party? What, I can't handle going to a party without you? It's messed up. It's a ghetto themed party. No it's not. Where are you getting this? What fliers? Okay never mind let's just drop it. We need to get going anyway, my parents are waiting. 'Yalla nimshy. ' You know, when white girls try to talk Arabic, usually it sounds pretty bad. You though? it sucks. You are such a jerk! I know. You love me though, right? Sure. Sure? I want you to say it. Yeah, I love you. Wow, I'm not convinced at all. Say it and mean it! That's the best I got. Say it with some passion, like it means something to you. Valerie, if you don't say it, I'm gonna hurt myself. And how are you going to do that? I'm gonna jump. And if I jump, you're jumping with me. I would really like to see that. You'd love to see me jump? Yeah. Last chance. My life's gonna flash before my eyes. Last chance. Nope. Okay. My Go- Coming! Hello. Hey. The hell happened to you two? There was a leak. There was a leak in the car? Yeah. Daddy this is Hazem. Good to finally meet you sir. Nice to meet you. Come on in. This one will fit right into the family photo album. Why don't you go upstairs, Valerie, and get something dry to wear. Maybe find something for Khazem. Have a seat. Just don't sit on the sofa please. So Khazem, that's an ethnic name. isn't it? It depends on where you're from I guess. Aren't you from the Middle East? I'm from Jersey. Hoboken. You're from Jersey. Okay so... Let's sit down somewhere. Maybe the dining room table. Sure. So... You have a beautiful home, by the way. Thank you very much. I like to keep it that way. My. Silence frightens me. So Hazem, you haven't told us what you've been studying. I'm a third year med student. 3.8 GPA. Wow that's wonderful. Money is always wonderful. That's why you're saying that you hit the jackpot, Valerie? Dad! I never said that. I never said that. Well I'm saying it. So what's the medical field like in your country? What happened? Valerie tells us you're from Egypt. Egypt? You told me Jersey. His parents are from Egypt. So what? Are you going to live in Egypt? No, Tim don't be silly. They're staying right here of course. Not that I don't like Egypt, Hazem.. I've seen pictures of the pyramids. Beautiful. What'd be so wrong with moving to Egypt? I think it'd be exciting. But a person should live in the best place they can afford. And you don't want to be around all those diseases. Well, I think it's easy to judge something from far away. Yeah, sure, but by the same token, You wouldn't want to be living in Compton, would you Kazem? Tim, you're being silly. Compton. All those baggy pants and guns. You know just the sight of guns... Frightens you. No, me too. I agree. Dad, you grew up in Detroit right? Warren. Yeah, a little city called Warren. Yeah? What was that like? It was clean. No, wait a second. No, nobody needs get up, I'll get it. Claire, eat your food. Hi, good to see you. Good to see you. Well, just dropped by? Yeah, sorry I'm a little late. Hey look who's here everybody. Garret. Garret. You remember Garret for God's sake! Garret, you remember, Valerie. This is Valerie's friend Kazem. Fiance dad. Hello Kazem. It's Hazem. Was that the first time you met Hazem Seif? I'd seen him before... but I hadn't officially met him 'till that night. What was your impression of him? I dunno. You dunno? You got five don't you? What? Do you have five? You have five. No, no, no, no. you stupid little twerp. No, Five sens- Five senses. You know, Hearing, taste, feeling. Hello! God gave you five senses. Now what was your impression of him? What was your opinion of Hazem Seif? He was kinda rude I guess. It was just.. It was an awkward night. Kazem was just telling us about living in Egypt. It's a very interesting place. Mom, can I speak to you for a minute? Valerie sweetheart, not now. Garret, would you like something to drink. Mom! Golly, alright. Excuse us. Mom what the hell is he doing here? I bring my fiance to meet you, And you invite my ex-boyfriend on the same night? Valerie, I'm not in love with your tone. I have chosen someone So your guys' little plan isn't going to work. Now let's go back to our guests and enjoy a pleasant dinner. And Valerie. What? You're hair... My God, mom! Stop! Where's the other guy? Yeah. The other detective who was talking to me. Gramps? He had to go home. But daddy's here now. I'm not a detective. I'm a federal agent. But I already told... What kind of relationship did you and Garret Perrin have? We didn't. I hate college girls. Other people... they usually wait till the fourth or fifth question... before they start lying to me. But college girls. There's nothing honest about them. I'm not lying. What did you tell the detective? God. We used to date! It was a long time ago. Your fiance know about this? So I'm telling ya, this fish. 20 pounds, 8 inches. I mean you had to see this son of a bitch to believe it. Now what're you girls doing? Where've you been? Valerie, just wanted to show me something, dear. Kazem wants to be a Doctor in Egypt. Dad, we really don't have to talk about this. That's lovely dear. I never actually said that. Egypt, you know? Egypt. Isn't that where those doctors there molested all those kids? That's neither here nor there. That was a rumor, Dad. Well just the same, I'm interested in Hazem's stance on the matter. I don't really have much of a stance, actually. If you think about it, one person's actions can't really speak for a large group of people anyway... You know all this talk of politics, marvelous. Valerie, would you pass the corn? It doesn't make any difference, I mean, for instance... Hazem, Tim's just trying to get to know you better. Yeah, I'm just asking questions. I mean everybody around here doesn't have to stand... on political correctness amongst family and friends. Right, Garret? Yeah. You know, I think um... I think we're done getting to know each other. I think Mr. Davis and I know each other very well by now. Is that supposed to mean something? Yes. Yes sir, it is. Excuse me. Garret, it was nice meeting you. I should probably get going. No, you sit down, son. You just stay right the hell where you are. What is wrong with you? Are you crazy? Valerie! I must be crazy to allow somebody like that in my home. That someone is the person I chose. Just like you got to choose and just like you got to choose. Then I must be double crazy to have allowed you to make such A monumental decision with such an immature mind. Can we discuss this later? Yes? Then why don't you choose for me, Dad? I should've. I should've chosen for you! Is that why you invited him? I invited him because I can invite... whoever I feel like inviting to my house. What the hell is he doing here? Don't raise your voice in this house! I don't want to do anything in your house! Are you the kind of girl that goes looking for trouble? That's not what we're talking about. You didn't think your parents would be upset... if you brought Hazem home? He's my fiance. You knew it wouldn't sit well with them, not with his background. You think you can say that kind of thing because you're black? You do see color! What I see is you throwing shit and trying to make it stick. People get murdered everyday. But one interracial murder happens And you get the cops and the FBI involved. When there's a chance for headlines, everybody wants a piece of the pie. Just a small town girl. Livin' in a lonely world. She took the midnight train goin' anywhere. You either change yourself to adapt to the world, or you change your world to adapt to you. Neither one is easy. But you just move on. Love you too. Hey. I do love you. So elasticity basically lets us compare apples and oranges. It's a unit-free measure that allows us to... quantify the differences in the market without standardizing... the units of measurement. Now one of the best ways to see this is in graphical form. So let's start with your very basic PED... or price-elasticity demand graph. What is this? Don't try to put it back up. Leave that up here for the whole class to see. I wanna know which one of you cowards... put this thing up here. You know what, screw it, I'm outta here. You know what? Forget this. I want an answer. What is this? Excellent. Now I want another answer. What are nooses used for? To lynch people. Good. Who used to use them? Slave owners. KKK. The Ku Klux Klan. Does anyone know what that means? Ku Klux Klan? No one knows? It's Greek. Kyklos. It means the circle. Yes, that's one version of the story. Another etymology proposes an onomatopoeia. Ku Klux Klan. Ku-klux-klan. It's the sound of a cocking bolt-action rifle. You see racism is rooted in violence... and violence is rooted in racism. I didn't come here for this shit. This is not the country I came to. We'll have this discussion next week. You all can leave. Come to the protest. Come to the protest. Come to the protest. Tremayne. Come to the protest. Come to the protest. Tremayne! Tremayne! Why are you being so rude? Try to smile. Smile, alright. Whatever. Excuse me sir, may I interest you in a protest? How about that? Come to the protest. How are we looking? Sixty people. Sixty people is good! Come to the protest. Come to the protest. Yo. Come to the protest. Hey, what is this? Basically these punks over at Kappa... are trying to throw this bullshit racist barbecue... It's an event held to mock and disrespect black culture. We're holding a demonstration to show our disapproval and share awareness that blatant discriminatory racism... happens on this campus. Wow. English major? You wanna sign our list? Yeah sure. Okay cool. This is Britney and Sean. He's gonna sign up. - Hey guys... - Hi! Go ahead and put your name down there. Okay. Valerie. Come to the protest. Is that your girl? Yeah, used to be. What happened? Him. So? Go get that. Are you kidding me? Do you see the guy she's with? You're gonna let Osama over there get in your way? You got something in mind? I just told you, man. Unless you like seeing her like that... I say you go take your shot! Worst thing that can happen is she says no. Best thing is you get your girl back. C'mon dude. Thank you, person I met twenty seconds ago. See you at the protest! Yeah, yeah... Come to the protest, man. Here you go. Thanks. Come to the protest. Yo, what the hell was that Rose? What was what? Why did you give that guy money? Trey, I give him change all the time. Yeah but things are different now. Look at us! Do you think I want to be out here doing this? I feel like every day something else reminds me that I'm black. Okay, when did you forget? No, when did you forget? Half these kids walk past us and they ignore us... or look the other way. You know why? Because we're niggers. - That's why! - I know that. - I know how he sees us. - That's how everyone else sees us! It's just you who can't see it. Okay! Well then keep your change to yourself next time. So you were there the first time Tremayne and Garret met? They didn't meet. He just gave him a flier. Your brother never told you that he had talked to Garret again? No. What would make him so special that... Tremayne would even remember? Relax Miss Torrance. Let me ask the questions. I'll be right with you. I have to pee so bad bro my kidney's about to explode. No that'd be your bladder. That's not your kidney. No, no, you're thinking about the liver. The bladder supports the kidney. Okay, can you believe him? Malik. Why is he over there talking to those people. She means girls. And he's just having fun, so why do you care? I don't. Aw... Hey what's up? Why are you here? I mean- ...why are you sitting here? I mean you just want me to hang out with you guys? No, I don't wanna hang out. You can stay here. I'll see you guys later. Hey where you going? Why would I wanna dance? I don't even know how to dance. That's alright. I'll just break some moves by myself. What is that? Aw ain't that cute? Dude. You guys wanna tell some jokes? Here we go. Here's yours. Here's your girlie drink. That's mine. Thank you. Enjoy that. This is a girlie drink? Dude, we're just here to have fun man, remember? Just chill. It's not a big deal. Yeah. Alright. Hey hot stuff. You look lonely. And thirsty. Wanna buy me a drink? It's gonna have to be quick before your boyfriend... comes back from the bathroom. He will kick your ass. Okay, seriously are you going to come to the party tomorrow? About that, I heard that it might be ghetto themed. Hey! It's celebrating black culture. So invite your black friends. I'm sure Hazem has some. Okay, we'll see. Woah, my bad man. You okay? Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Wooh! I think I'm gonna throw up. Hey. You alright? I don't feel really good. Here I got you. You need a ride home or something? Damn baby you're wasted. You wanna get outta here? Are you gonna drive me? Yeah, I'll drive you. Yo. Get the hell outta here, alright? Take a hike man. Get outta here. No, I promise you. You do not want that, alright? Back up and walk outta here. Taxi! We can be in the same place, at the same time... and still not get along. They say it's a small world. And yet, we still find a way to avoid each other. Boo! God you're such a jerk! What are you doing? I'm studying! Yeah, what's going on here? Gosh. I think the plant's exudation... ended up intoxicating the soil pH so... I think I'm going to have to re pot it. Well thank God that's settled. One more question. What exactly were you going to do with this? Water me to death? Go away. Fine. I have to go see my dad. He's been calling me every other day. Okay, don't forget to tell him about the wedding date. Of course. Matrimony! Hey! How do I get some food here? Is that everything is relative. Every single thing. Well you need to be a little more specific Garret. I mean opinions can be relative. But math. Math is relative? Absolutely. Who decided that ten was ten? Here. Take this. No come on, I'm not taking your money. Take it. Okay? It's okay. Thanks. Seriously, you keep this in the oven? Seriously, that's about how much money it takes... to open up a bank account, okay? It's non-alcoholic okay? It's my one treat. Don't say it. I wasn't going to say anything. Okay, let's watch the game. Why is ten the number where we start over? Ya know, why isn't it eight? Ya know, why don't we go 5, 6, 7, 8, and then 1, 2, 3, 4? Wow. And you go to college. How many fingers and thumbs do I have? That's probably why we count to ten. No but see... I cheated, okay? Yeah, you did. You did. You see my new piece of art, up on the wall? Yeah. Absolutely beautiful, isn't it? That is God's greatest gift, you know? And God is telling us that the rich can have their... beachfront mansions and Ferraris but that the greatest things... that we get to look at in life are always gonna be free. Or, $5.95. That's a fortune cookie there. You know what the difference is between... a mansion and a porcupine is? What's that? The pricks are on the outside of a porcupine. Another fortune cookie. Alright let's get back to watching this game. A child that was bullied will grow up to be violent. Someone discriminated against will go on to... reflect that to others. It's a vicious cycle. And everyone sits back and claims to be the victim. Daddio! Guess what? I answered your call and I'm not on my bike. Garret sweetheart. It's your aunt. Something happened. What's goin' on? Everyone is here. I'm staying here as long as you need. Okay. What happened? The doctors tried everything. Wait. What? Garret honey. Your father didn't make it. Garret listen to me. Aunt Tina? Garret, it's Alexander. Alexander? Yeah, I'm glad I was able to catch you. You busy? My dad just passed. He was killed. By two thugs. My God... I'm so sorry. Garret, stay put. I'll take you home. Trust me. We can make things right again. What do you he meant by "we can make things right again?" I can't read his mind. You know Alexander. You know what kind of a man he is. What do you think he meant? I don't know. You trust him? I barely knew him. Do you trust him now? Alright, tell me, what happened next? Where are you taking me? I thought you were taking me home? Just passing by the house for a second. I'll be right back. Stay here. Hey white boy! You wanna dance with me? I got dat purple drank. Woah, slow down! Come on. What up, nigga! Wooh! Garret! Garret! Come with me. Talk to me man. What happened? I don't wanna talk about it. Don't get up in my face dude! Garret. Just take a deep breath. I'm here for you. Just tell me what happened. They killed him man. Who killed him? Our neighbor said she saw two kids... running around the place earlier. Kids? Yeah, just some black guys. You think it was them? Val! Hey over here! Hey! I knew you'd come! This place is crazy! What's on their faces? Where's Hazem? Did he come with you? Now listen. Zone everything else out. Nothing exists except you and your goal. And the only thing standing in your way is him. Now you won some fights before, but this is the fight. You lose today, you lost them all. You Understand? Now go take care of this chump. Alright, bring it in gentlemen. Alright, fight clean, fight fair. Touch gloves. Back to your corners. Are you ready? Ready? Let's do it! Real action! Real pain! Real action! Real pain! Real action! Real pain! Real action! Real pain! I don't know what to do? Don't do anything, it's not your fault. He was trying to call me. He was trying to call me. I just. I just wish I could've talked to him. He reached out to me. Why didn't they just take the money? Why didn't they just take the money and go? I don't understand! Do you believe in heaven? Do you believe in heaven, Garret? I don't-I believe in God. Your father was a good man. Whoever did this. Why? You're asking the wrong question. Then what's the right question? You gotta ask the right questions, Garret. It's not about why they shot him. No, it's much simpler than that. It's about who you are and who they are. That's the price you pay for being part of the majority. What did you think of the Compton Cookout? What do you mean what did I think? I didn't think anything? So you didn't go to the party. You know I didn't go. But you didn't go to the protest. Where exactly do you stand on all this? I had a match. Two hundred people watched me fight a guy... the entire time the party was going on. That doesn't answer my question. What were you doing at that party? I didn't know it was gonna be like that. And when you saw Tremayne there. I didn't see him there! They were all outside. What were they doing outside? Racists have no place here! Stop the hate! Stop the fear! Racists have no place here! Stop the hate! Stop the fear! No justice! No peace! No justice! No peace! No justice! No peace! No justice! No peace! Wow, look at that. Now they want to take away our freedom of speech. What are you doing? Watch this. 9-11. State your emergency. Yeah my brother is having an asthma attack! He's not breathing. We're stuck in the car... and there's a big crowd of people in the street. I'm sending an ambulance to your location. They look drunk. They're blocking the street and- And, my God. They look like they're getting violent. We have a squad car in the area now. I'm sending it your way. Put your ear up to his chest- Please hurry! Wait for sixty seconds. Fifty-nine. Fifty-eight. Keep your hands up! That's it. Move! Hands up. Sweep! Sweep! What do we want? When do we want it? Now! What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now! Forty-three. Forty-two. Forty one. Who wants to do some body shots! Wooh! Thirty-five. Thirty-four. Thirty-three. Nineteen, eighteen, seventeen. Justice! MLK. Huey Newton. Rosa Parks. Fred Hampton. Malcolm X. Justice! Justice! Justice now! Racist white boys, get outta here! Justice! Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Stop the hate! Stop the fear! Stop the hate! Stop the fear! Bye-bye losers. Stop the hate! Stop the fear! Alright, alright. Settle down. Settle down! Let's clear these streets immediately. Officer. With all due respect... we have the right to peaceful assembly! We need to get these people out of the streets right now. Hey, we have a right to be here! Zero-forty. Start some additional units. Sir, we're not breaking any laws. Be that as it may, we can't have all these people... Don't you see what's going on in there you dumb ass? You wanna see the real criminals, look behind you. You guys are creating a traffic hazard. Now we need everyone to get off the street now! We're not going to say it again. Let's go. Move! Screw the police! A single action. A symbol. But it can change everything. Hey! Hold on! Woah woah woah! Get back now! Get back! Tremayne go! Yo, this is bullshit! Why are you here? You brought me here. I don't know. You wanna know what I think? I think you were looking for some truth. And you thought I could give it to you. Truth is you flinch when you're at the bank... and two homies walk in. You're not surprised when you're driving down the highway... and you get cut off. And there's an Asian behind the wheel. You're scared when the plane's about to takeoff... and Osama sits next to you with his towel-head wife. You hold your breath as they pass by. No one tells us to feel this way. We just feel it on your own. The media doesn't put these stereotypes into our heads. Television only mirrors reality. It's our experiences that tell us that there are good people and there are bad people. And now I'm telling you. I'm telling you all the things that you think... but you won't say. It's not their poverty. It's not lack of education that makes them criminals. No one goes to the ghetto and passes out guns. It's just them. Pig ass cops. They say what goes around comes around. Just maybe not like we expect it to. Bang, bang, bang! You were just takin' it to him, wasn't you? I just had to feel him out. That's all. That was nice and then bang, bang, bang, boom! Knockout! That was sick! I learned from the best! That's why. My man. Hey you think you can give me a minute? You gotta holler at your girl? Yeah. Alright man. Hey, there you are. Listen, I'm going to get going. It's getting late. Okay honey. Do you want me to walk you out? No it's okay. I'll be good. I'll talk to you later okay? Okay bye. Our biggest flaw is not that we make mistakes. It's that we don't know when we make them. What're you doing here? Nothing. I was just... Yeah, I know who you are. I saw you at that party. Yeah I see you. I see you. Was Miss Davis sexually assaulted? Aww, c'mon now Mister Perrin. In your statement... Here, and I quote, lemme see, "She came back to the party... Her eyes were all teary. And she told me that he raped her. " No. Look! Valerie didn't say anything. Laura was the one who told us. I don't know what she said. Dumb ass, I told you to paint these black. Who cares? What is this? White face? Alexander, my God! What's wrong? I need to talk to you. Do you think Tremayne Torrance actually raped Valerie? I don't know the guy. I never met him. And yet you were going to kill him? You don't need to know a guy in order to... So you admit you were going to kill him. What's up? A girl downstairs was beaten and raped. My God. When did this happen? Less than fifteen minutes ago. One of the monkeys outside did it. He ran to the forest. Let's go get the little shit. Ready for some payback? Bring that. Hello? Hazem. Valerie where are you? I called you a million times! Hazem I need you to come here please. I'm coming just tell me, Valerie. I can't hear you. Where are you? Where are you? Hazem you can't get mad. You went to the party. I don't. I cant. Hazem, it's Laura. Laura what the hell happened. Look you need to get here right now. I'm coming. Just tell me what happened. She said he went toward the forest. Well, is that what she told you? And so you followed him? Hazem! If everything seems under control... then you're not paying attention. You trying to play hardball with me son? I'm not trying. You followed him toward the forest. Yeah. Why? I dunno. To kill him! No. Mister Seif, we have a number of witnesses who saw you... driving toward the arboretum to murder Tremayne Torrance. Did you hear what I said? What? How's that Did I have a sign pinned on me saying... "I'm going to go kill him"? Who saw me? I'm asking the questions here, son. And I'd advise you to take this more seriously. I'd advise you to take your time more seriously. Look at it. Listen chump, I'm the only thing between you... and a life in prison and you know this. And you're scared to death about it. I'm not your opponent here. I am not your equal. I'm the goddamn right hook that drops your ass. Well then why are we still talking? Those kids are so ridiculous. There he is! There he is! Wooh! Yo nigga where you goin'? Yo, what'd you say? You heard me. Right in the jungle where you belong right- Asshole! Get off him you monkey! Get him! Yeah! Asshole! Piece of shit! Come on! Stupid coon! Come on! Stop! Come on nigga! Please! Stupid nigger! Come on, nigga! Sam! No! I know you. What did you say? I know you. You don't know me man, don't talk to me. Shit it's you. What you want cracker? You'll always have to answer to someone. Ain't that right nigga? Alright, let's get outta here. My God. Guys. He's not breathing. What? You guys hear about that girl. She got molested- I just can't believe they cuffed me man. You're lucky you aren't in jail right now. Yeah I'm serious. Why are you making this about you? There are a lot more things going on right now. Guys just stop arguing! Guys! Trey is missing. It's gonna be alright! Hi. You've reached Tremayne Torrance. ...and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Rose. Rose! Where are you going? Rose! Dude I am not going to jail for this man! My God. What the hell was that, Alexander? Dude just shut up! Don't tell me to shut up, Nolan! I told you you're hitting too hard! And where the hell did that come from? And you kicking him in the face was good for his health, right? Would you just cut it out? Guys we gotta get out of here. No, no we can't just leave him here. Our fingerprints are all over him! Dude, fists don't leave fingerprints! We weren't feeling him up! We gotta hide the body man. We can't hide the body. We can't just leave him here man. We can't leave. He recognized me. He saw my face. He's dead, man. - Nolan: Why does that matter? - I know! I know that! He was drunk? Maybe he hit his head. Sam look at his face! How's he supposed to do that to himself? I don't know! Sam. You got any rope in your car? Yeah. Yeah... Go get it. Holy shit Alexander. - What? What? - What the hell is that? You just said it. He did it to himself. He hit himself in the face with a crowbar? Are you thinking right? You gonna help me with this, brother? You gonna help me with this, brother? Yeah, I'll help you. But after that I'm out man. I'm out. Go get the stool too. The one that Garret brought. Okay. Alright. Who's idea was it to fake a suicide? Now, wait. People saw you coming out of the fraternity... with that stool, Garret. No. I didn't touch him. Why'd you bring the stool? Why? I didn't- I didn't know what it was for. And then what happened? Well? What happened after that? I don't remember. You aided in the murder of an innocent man. No. Wait a minute! I didn't touch him. My fingerprints weren't on him. I was just there. You did not stop them. Of course it is. Criminal facilitation. You had knowledge of the incident. That's an accessory. Wait a minute. I was... You stated you didn't know the whereabouts of... Alexander Kraus, Samuel Boergadine, or Nolan Miller. Who else was there? I don't know. I... Who else was there? We spoke to your trainer Dimon. ANd you've had some weapons training too, is that right? I get it. So, I didn't go to the protest and so I'm a racist. I had weapons training so I'm a murderer. And now, put two and two, I must have killed him. I'm glad we're on the same page. Give me a minute. I'll have someone get you a formal letter of confession. Yeah you know what, let's do it. Do you think this is funny? Yes, I do. But I wasn't the one... who was identified at the scene of a murder... standing under Tremayne's body holding a weapon. Ha! It was a baseball bat. It's not a weapon. Plus the kid was lynched, right? So with some detective work... you'll realize that your assumption... doesn't mean anything. Clever. But must I remind you that Tremayne was beaten... before he was hung? Surprised, Aside from having his neck broken, snapped... Tremayne's left arm was broken. What kind of weapon do you think was suitable for that? Do you know? Do you know or should I tell you? No man save your breath. You'll need it to blow up your date. Listen you arrogant prick. I have an eye witness who said you helped kill him. How about that? You know what your problem is? You don't know how to lie. Go ahead check the bat for DNA. Hey buddy, a guy does that to my fiance, shit, I'd kill him too. You wanna hit me? Take a shot. How about you shut your Goddamn mouth? You had to go. A tough guy like you. Couldn't just go home, look her in the eye, knowing that another man touched her. Had his hands all over her. The minute you got that phone call, your mind was made up. The minute you got that call, Tremayne was a dead man. You know what, go screw yourself. I'm not answering any more of your questions. I'm not even finished yet. We're just getting to the juicy stuff right now. This isn't a joke. No honey, it's not. But you know what is funny? You date one guy. Dump him. Get engaged to another. Then you get him to murder a third guy. All for you, Valerie. Valerie of Troy. Or Sparta. Which is it? Troy or Sparta? Hell with you, it might be both. I didn't get him to do anything! I mean he didn't murder him. - Prove it! - I don't have to! This is not a game, princess. A young man was lynched. And I need answers. Now you give me something to dance with. Why am I being interrogated? I need the overtime. I'm the only one who has no reason to be here. Can you explain that? You're a smart girl. Take a stab at it. You want me to say something that you can use against Hazem. Final answer? Is that why I'm here? Look I hate to be the one to tell you honey. But you should know that Romeo actually testified against you. He told me you were the last person to see Tremayne alive. Said you saw him in an alley. Couple hours later he was found dead. So that's why you're here princess. Romeo's gonna spend a long time in prison. So I suggest you put the wedding off. That's okay, I'll wait for him. After he testified against you? He didn't! He killed a man and he wanted to frame you! He had no reason to kill anyone! He had all the reason he needed because of you. There's no one else. There were four other guys... No one else with a reason. They all had reasons! You don't have him! I'm gonna hang him for it. You're lying. If he didn't do it, you know who did. I did it! Okay? It was me. I did it. Imagine if you could get a glimpse... through someone else's eyes. Suddenly, judging them loses its appeal. So I want you to listen to me closely. We have an eye witness who saw Hazem... at the scene of your brother's murder. Now we got him... and we got you. You saw him right after. He's a young man. His fiance was just assaulted by Tremayne... less than an hour before he was killed. Tremayne didn't touch her! She ran off crying to her friends... because she saw a black guy in a hoodie. My brother didn't touch her. All the numbers add up Rose. All we need is you. So let me ask you again. Did you see anything to indicate that... Hazem Seif took part in murder your brother? No! I already said no. What is this? Do you understand what you're doing? You could be letting Trey's killer get away. No one would doubt you about Hazem. Is that what this is about? You need to decide what side you're on, Rose. Now, let's try to do the right thing. The right thing. My God. Trey! My- What did you do? No, no I just got here. I just got here. Please, wake up! That's my brother! What did you do to him? I didn't do anything! You think I did this? Go away. Go away! Here Trey. He's cold and you're just standing here. Here Trey. God. No! Get off of him! Get off of him. Just shut up a minute I got this! What are you doing? C'mon Trey come down. Yeah. Get him down. Please. Please. Wake up, Trey. What did you do to my brother? What did you do to my brother? I just got here! I already told you that! Are you crazy!? What happened to him? What happened to my brother? Tremayne! God... Only under extreme circumstances... only when we're pushed to our limits... only when we have so much at stake... is our character truly tested. And how we respond says everything about who we are. We argue about right and wrong. Meanwhile the guilty walk away unpunished. Then we say justice is served, but it doesn't mean that... injustice didn't happen. Justice won't be served as long as the good are silent. It's always obvious when you look back on it... what was right and what was wrong. I got the grant. Thirty thousand dollars. It's a lot of money. But I'm giving it to a childrens' home... in the inner city. It was supposed to be for you. I miss you. Dad, I miss you so much. I didn't have enough time with you. But I'm okay, I'm okay though. And I know what I did was wrong... and I take full responsibility for it. From now on, I'm gonna be a better person. I'm gonna do good things. I'm going to make things right again. I'm going to make things right again. First there was God. And then there was light. And then there was Man. And Man was different. And then they killed one another because they were different. Everybody wants progress. But if you're on the wrong road... then progress is the worst thing to have. People say that in an ideal world... you would never notice a person's color. But that can only happen after appreciation. And appreciation can only come after acceptance. We would notice a splinter in a stranger's eyes... while overlooking the branch in our own. Racism is rooted in violence. And violence is rooted in racism. Once you're able to scare people... it's easy to control them. Manipulate them. Fear rules all. Woah! My God! Call the cops! Someone call the cops! What if we just need to stop being afraid? What if we're all guilty? What about the violence? Who's guilty of that? Stop!
