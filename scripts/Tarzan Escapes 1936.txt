Pardon me, my good man, but we're looking for the residency. We better be careful. They probably belong to some fighting tribes in the interior. Here, here, here. Go on, you blighters. Off it. Go on. Off it, off it. The very idea. That's the only language those poor heathens understand, sir. Herbert Henry Rawlins, at your service. Thank you so much. We're looking for the residency. Residency or resident? Resident. Righto. It so happens his nibs is at my employer's compound... ...checking out a shipment of wild animals. Well, sir, how was merry old England when you left it? - Well... - Yeah, a bit of all right, eh? You, miss, how do you find your first go at Africa? Grim enough, I suppose. But look at me, making you answer a lot of questions. I'll bet you're just tired of talking. Well, anything you want to know, just ask me. - Well, there was one... - Oh, here we are. Excuse me, governor. Two young people from home wanna see the resident. I'm the resident. Masters is my name. How do you do? I'm Eric Parker. - This is my sister, Rita. - How do you do? Miss Parker, you're not exactly a usual sight around these parts. Nor any parts, for that matter, I should say. My name is Fry. Captain Fry. No, you fool! Can't have my pet ripped up by a common cat. - Your pet? - Yes, over there in that cage. Like to see him? He doesn't look like he needed protection. Oh, no. He'd make short work of a common leopard. Color of their hide seems to get into their dispositions. - He's too valuable to be mauled, though. - I'm terrified of him. Even with these bars between us. Don't you worry, Miss Parker. I designed that cage myself. Duralumin. I'll guarantee it'll hold anything. We won't keep you any longer from your business. Well, it's nothing private, Captain Fry. Rita and I are just looking for something called the Mutia Escarpment. Is that all? My dear boy, perhaps you'd like us to arrange a visit to the craters of the moon. I don't know what you're laughing at, but I assure you, it's a serious matter to us. In Africa, the most serious matter is always the noonday sun. Yes, it makes ladies and gentlemen talk a bit barmy-like. Especially until they get a bit climaxed to it. Since we seem to be so ridiculously green, perhaps you would point out what it is. Well, first, the single approach to the Mutia Escarpment... ...is said to lie through the Gaboni country. A cheery lot, the Gabonis. - I've never seen one. Have you, Fry? - No. Although I've seen victims floating down the river... ...after the Gabonis finished with them. - Bring some drinks, Rawlins. - Yes. Only the largest and most completely equipped safari... ...could hope to fight through. And as you say, that's beyond the means of most people. In the second place, from the native rumors of the escarpment... ...I should judge it quite impractical for even a large party. They say it's like a long cloud in the distance. Sheer cliffs 1000 to 1500 feet in height and running out of sight in either direction. Bomba, limes. But isn't there always a third place, Captain Fry? Oh, yes, I was coming to that. In the third place, no safari native could be induced to disregard the juju. - What's juju? - Black magic, taboo, anything forbidden. Oh, dear. Really. When you've lived as long in Africa as Captain Fry, Miss Parker... ...you'll realize that there's a certain amount... ...of truth underlying all native superstitions. What is the nature of this particular superstition? - Well... - A race of great apes. With a leader. A very capable leader, too, with power of life and death over the entire jungle. The oddest thing, according to these stories, is his color. - His color? - White. Blimey. A white gorilla? Do you believe this? Well, I believe that up there, where no white man's ever been before... ...waits someone, or shall we say, something... ...mysterious and formidable natives fear. A thing that doesn't want to be disturbed. There you have it, Miss Parker. Cliffs, savages and the taboo. A combination nobody could beat. But one man did beat it, Mr. Masters. A white hunter named Harry Holt. Oh, yes, I remember the fellow. Claimed to have discovered the Elephants' Graveyard, didn't he? Yes, Holt's real motive then was very much what ours is now. Mr. Masters, we have reason to believe... ...that our cousin Jane is alive at this moment... ...above the Mutia Escarpment, living among the great apes. There you are, governor. The monks have been known to carry off a native woman. Yes, but the leader isn't an ape. Now, Holt was quite clear on that point. The leader is a man, a white man. And Jane is staying there by her own wish. Admitting this extraordinary story to be true... ...would you be good enough to explain... ...what you hope to accomplish even if you should find your cousin? Well, you see, our father and Jane's father had a third brother, Uncle Peter. He was extremely wealthy and rather difficult. When he took it into his eccentric old head to die last spring... ...he left half of his fortune of nearly a million pounds... ...to the London University for the purposes of entomological research. - Come again, miss? - Bugs. The second half he left to Jane, providing she was alive... ...and could be induced to return to civilization. Otherwise, the bugs get the whole million. And if you succeed in bringing this good news to your cousin... ...you hope to profit to some extent. Well, I've staked every penny I've got on it. And if we fail, it means, amongst other things... ...that Eric won't finish his medical studies. Well, if you're in a position to adequately equip a safari... ...under the direction of a well-qualified man, Captain Fry, for instance... But then, you heard Captain Fry's opinion of the whole enterprise. If you and your brother care to join me... ...I'll be making safari for the Mutia Escarpment at 7:00 tomorrow morning. Bomba! - Captain Fry... - Don't waste your time thanking me. You'll need to get properly outfitted before you leave tomorrow. Captain Fry, before we accept your very kind offer... ...would you mind telling us why you made it? We'll say I need a vacation with just a touch of adventure thrown in. Just that. We'll be ready at 7:00 tomorrow morning. Well, hang me. The biggest blooming hunter in the whole blinking continent... ...turning himself into a glorified tourist guide. And all for the sake of a dash of adventure. Oh, come off it, governor. What's the idea? Gonna try and catch you that mythological white ape? - You're right. - Thank you. You're right for the first time in 10 years. We're making safari at 7:00 tomorrow morning. Knock down the steel cage and box it to go. - Don't stand there like a... - Fool? - Right. Get going. - Yes, sir. Look at those. I say, aren't they awful-looking creatures? - We land here, Bomba. - Yes, bwana. Well, that's what I meant. - Bomba, those four top boxes. Look alive. - Yes, bwana. But, Captain Fry, this place is a bog. I'm sorry. I didn't choose it myself. Get ashore, please. Come along, Rita. - Not that way, Miss Parker. - Well, why not? Ever chuck a stick into a hornets' nest? That's our route. The swamp will cover our tracks and it's the right direction, as far as I can judge. Well, you'll get through all right, Miss Parker. Pretty squashy going. Oh, well, I like paddling. Eric, look. Wouldn't shoot if I were you. They won't bother us if we don't bother them. There's no sense in advertising our presence. If it's all the same to you, Mr. Parker, I'd like to keep it a secret. - Look at them all. Isn't it amazing? - This is certainly a hunter's paradise. You haven't seen anything yet. Oh, look at that lot! They're handy little things to have about the house. And all of those. Oh, aren't they grand? Captain Fry. There's your Mutia Escarpment, Mr. Parker. All right, push them along, Bomba. Stir them up with that kaibok. Captain Fry! Juju, bwana. Oh, why not take a tip from their natural instincts, sir, and let the whole thing go. - I mean, this is Gaboni country. - Right. Till I think of a way to push these boys, it looks like we'll stay here. We camp here, Bomba. No tents. Send one of the boys for water. Why, you little... What is it? You pretty creature. Thank you so much. I'm sorry I was such a nuisance. Well, I'd rather not have to do any more shooting while we're around here. - Water yet? - Water not yet, bwana. Send another boy. Gabonis. Get the men ready to move. Still clear on the juju side. We'll cross the river and make a run for it. Get them together, Bomba. Hey, we won't leave that. Quickly! - What was it? An animal? - Whatever it was, we should be grateful. Grateful to the Gabonis too, I suppose, what's left of us. We've got no choice now. Get the men started, Bomba. We're going up. Men say no go, bwana. Men say juju. All right, let them stay. See how they like the Gabonis. That was a close thing. Blinking close. Blimey. I wouldn't climb another step, not even to get up to heaven. Maybe you're nearer than you think. We camp here, Bomba. Tents. We're not gonna make permanent camp here, are we? The escarpment's a bit too big to comb end to end... ...for your cousin and her white ape friend. So we shall have to devise some means to get them to come and visit us. How on earth are we going to do that? That's a matter to which I've given considerable thought. I'll figure it out. Supposing he does come and try and set his friends free... ...isn't he liable to be a bit unpleasant? That's a question I shall better be able to answer by tomorrow morning. - What do you say, Rawlins? - I never spoke, sir. I think we better turn in and give our little plan a chance. - Yes. Good night, Captain Fry. - Good night. I'll just have a last look around with Rawlins. - Good night. - Good night. - Night, Rita. - Good night. - Is it ready? - Ready as butter, sir. If it's not sprung tonight, take it down by sunrise. Yes, sir. Governor? It was a very good idea, bringing in this cage. All he has to do is to step in here to free this ape... ...the trap will spring and we have him. - Rawlins, you're a genius. Yes, sir. - Captain Fry, do you hear what I heard? - What did you hear? Sounded like the cry we heard below the escarpment. Don't you think what you both need most is a good night's sleep? I shall have a gun tonight. I don't want shooting. I want to take him alive. All right, my lad. Go on, laugh. You'll be laughing the other side of your face soon. You're just bait. That's what you are, bait. Rawlins, catch it. Well, that seems to work all right. Of course, sir, you'll post sentries around here in every direction. What, and scare him off? No. Bomba will watch at the north. You do the same here. - By the trap? - Yes. And if he comes... ...I don't want you to move or make a sound unless anything happens. - Anything happens? - In which case, send for me quietly. You took the words right out of my mouth, sir. - You can hide in the brush down here. - All right, sir. I suppose I'll be quite comfortable. Captain, there are times when I sort of get a creepy feeling... ...that he knows all about us. - Maybe he does, Rawlins. - Yeah... - Good night, Rawlins. - Goodbye, sir. Cheetah. Cheetah. - Captain Fry! - Rita, what is it? - He was here. I saw him. - Which way? There, I think. - What's happened? - He's been here. Bomba! Bomba! Where's that fool? These lashings have been cut. Rawlins! Where's that idiot? - What the deuce are you doing there? - Oh, Captain Fry... ...I've had a horrible, horrible experience. That huge monster attacked me and after a fierce struggle... ...he hurled me to the ground and stamped on me. Next time I opened my eyes, he'd turned himself into a horrible, hairy ape. Did he spring the trap? No, sir. That was a precaution of my own, sir. Bomba, get the boys and round up animals! Tarzan. Jane. Tarzan, let go. I'm not awake yet. What will the neighbors think? - Hurt? - I'm glad you woke me. - I was having a nightmare. I was afraid. - Afraid? I dreamt I was back in London in a horrible, rushing taxi. The radio was going and I was on my way... ...to play bridge with my three maiden aunts. Thank you for being such a horrible, kidnapping monster and keeping me here. Jane. Oh, just a moment. Before you start any more of your usual blarney... ...where were you last night? - Swim. - Nope. No, we won't swim. And don't try to change the subject. You didn't get in this morning until all hours. And you were carrying your shoes. - Swim, swim, swim. - No. Cheetah. - Where did this come from, Tarzan? - Swim. Tarzan, please. I've got to know. - People. - Yes, I know. But white people? Where? - Swim now. - Tarzan, I've got to see them. - No. - Please. No. Please, Tarzan. Stay. Stay. Oh, what a hideous monster it was, this. It's a wonder to me that all the hair on our heads didn't go white during the night. As far as his looks, I thought he was rather sweet. Sweet, Miss Rita? Did you get a good look at him? He was looking at me. Mind you now, miss. If he'd have fought fair, I'd have had him. Oh, yes, I'd have had him. But there I was, with just my two hands to his four. He had a big, heavy club in each of them. And there he come, howling at me and waving them just like... In dealing with animals, Eric, there's one thing to always remember. We're their superiors for two reasons. One's self-control and the other a gun. Well, what's the matter with you? - Where's Miss Parker? - Oh, Captain Fry... Come on, speak up, man. - That man was here again. - Miss Parker! Oh, it's no good, sir. It's no good. He's appropriated her, sir. - Which way? - Up. Rita! Bomba! - Oh, we'll never find her. - Brace up. That sort of thing won't help. Help? He's probably carried her clear out of the country by this time. Rita, where are you? I'm up here. Rita. - Don't worry, I'm all right. - Isn't that Eric? Yes, of course it's Eric. I've found her! - Hello, Jane. - Hello. - Who's the other one? - He's the man who brought us here. - Oh, isn't this wonderful? - Darling, I'm so glad to see you. Will you stop talking and come down here? Yes, we'll be right down. That is, we will be right down, won't we? Tarzan, take Rita down. - Jane sorry? - I've never been so happy... ...in my whole life. Tarzan! - Eric. - Jane, darling, it's really you. Yes, and very much alive and quite well and awfully happy. Rich too, I hear. - Tarzan, this is my cousin Eric. - My cousin Eric. How do you do? - Jane, this is Captain Fry. - How do you do? How do you do? Feels so funny. I haven't done this for ages. Tarzan, this is Captain Fry. Tarzan, Tarzan. Captain Fry is a friend too. He helped Rita and Eric to find us. Friend too. Oh, he... He likes me! - Hey! - Please. Well, that's the end of that gun. I'm sorry, Captain Fry, but Tarzan has seen guns kill. Well, I understand his point of view. Still, there's the matter of how I'll protect my party. That won't be necessary, now that Tarzan's looking after you. Well, what about lunch? We can't run around the jungle hunting our lunch with our hands. No. You're to be our guest. Rita, there's no use you camping out and being uncomfortable... ...while you've got a whole house. - House? You mean that... Oh, this little bird's nest? No, I mean our townhouse. We've got lots of room. You'll be comfortable. Tarzan made it. I designed the kitchen myself. - The kitchen? - Hot and cold water. All the latest conveniences. Captain Fry, tell your men to break camp. I'll show you the way. - Tarzan, do the marketing. - Market. - Yes, food for all these people. - Food. - And hurry back. - Hurry back. Now, don't keep that up all night. Me? I'm sleeping aloft. I'm company, I am. And don't go having none of them there nightmares. Now, don't you let that roast burn. Jane, we didn't come here just to make you unhappy. We think you owe it to yourself to come back. Until you're quite sure. I know. I think you came because you wanted me more than my money. - Oh, but, Jane... - Oh, I'm not ungrateful. No, Rita can have all the silk stockings she wants. Eric can have his career, an enormous yellow roadster to drive his girl about in. - There is a girl? - Oh, naturally. I'd like to meet her. - Eric, couldn't I just sign a paper or...? - No, Jane. I think Uncle wanted to leave all his money to his frightful museum. You were a matter of conscience. Otherwise, the will could never impose so many obstacles. Of course, if Tarzan would let me go... I must ask you to say nothing to Tarzan... ...until I've had a chance to tell him my own way. I want him to know why I'm going and how soon I'm going to be back. Jane, why not bring Tarzan with you? - Back to London? - Yes, of course! If you like it, you could spend half your time here and half your time there. No, Rita. Out here, Tarzan's a king. How do I know what he'd be back there? Perhaps, at first, sort of a freak. And then, as he learnt more about civilization... ...he'd realize he was dependent on his rich wife. He'd never tolerate that. Or if he did, it might be even worse. Oh, Miss Parker, this looks like your lord and master coming now. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - No, I meant, "How are you?" - All right. You were away so long. Aren't they beautiful this year? - Oh, and these are ripe too. - Eat? - As soon as we get some water, darling. - Miss Parker! Miss Parker! - What is it, Rawlins? - I don't think this animal likes me. - Perhaps you're not using the right word. - Oh, blimey. No, that might be it. Here, you. Going up. All aboard. Oh, go on now, will you? I'd do the same for you one day. Alley-up! Now, whatever you do, don't let go, Ongali. Or whatever your name is. Offhand, roast beef, I should say. Make yourself useful in the kitchen, Rawlins. Yes, sir. - Could I be of any service? - Yes. - Tarzan, show him how to get water. - Water. Now, this is very, very clever. - Did all this come out of your own head? - Head? I mean the idea, not the water. Water. Oh, Cheetah, you might turn on that fan for a while, will you? Dinner, everyone. Dinner. - Oh, I'm ready. - What ho! Supposing you try and wait on us without getting your thumbs in the soup. Here's my contribution. Don't blame me if it's carrots. It's not carrots. It's very good, even if I don't know the name. Eric, stop it. Now, Rita, you sit here, Captain Fry, Eric, over there. - Tarzan will carve. - Is there anything Tarzan can't do? Matter of fact, he's clever at almost everything. Aren't you, Tarzan? I say, look at the size of that roast. No soup. - Eat now. - Oh, I second the motion. You have some tribes on the escarpment? Yes, indeed. Awful savages they are too. They must give you trouble, don't they? No, the most powerful tribe of all... ...lives about a day's safari west of here. But Tarzan is such a juju to them they leave us alone. They don't even harm the animals. But they'd be pleased if we were to clear off... ...and leave this whole hunting ground to them. You don't have contact with the natives? I mean, they don't speak any known language. We leave them alone too. But natives everywhere manage to understand each other somehow. Yes, that's true. Miss Parker... Thank you, Cheetah. No, now, greedy. Here, take this outside. Go on. Her table manners aren't all they should be. Oh, I'm very much obliged. Yes, thank you. Listen to me. I want you to understand... ...that any attempt at familiarity is very much resented. Thank you. - Miss Parker, I've been thinking... - Hey, old Fry's been thinking. It's no concern of mine, but I overheard you when you discussed it. I've found a solution about what to do with Tarzan when you go to England. - Please, Captain Fry... - Go? No, you haven't heard me out. My idea is not to leave him. Take him with you. No need for him to be dependent. I'll offer him a contract that'll make him fortune. - You mean, put Tarzan on exhibition? - Nothing like that. He could lecture on wildlife and handle wild animals as never before. What do you say? Come to England. You'll be a sensation. Captain Fry, my cousin particularly wished that this shouldn't be mentioned. Oh, I am sorry. I had no idea it was supposed to be a secret. - Secret? Jane go? - Hold on, Tarzan. This wasn't Jane's idea. There's a paper at home that Eric and I must have signed. Otherwise, we'll lose a lot of money if Jane doesn't help us. - Money? - Yes, Tarzan, money. You know, to get clothes and food and... Food, clothes... ...money? - No, Tarzan, you don't understand. - Money isn't that, it's... - Of course he doesn't understand! I hope he never does. - Secret. - No, Tarzan. No. Jane go? Jane people go? Only if you're willing... ...not if it's going to cause you the least bit of unhappiness. Tarzan! Cheetah. Tarzan, Tarzan. Jane no happy? How shall I tell you, darling? I love Tarzan. Tarzan is Jane's love. Like the stars over the night, like the air to breathe. Tarzan makes me alive, but Eric and Rita are my friends. Friends, like rain at the end of the summer... ...like the wind moving the tops of the jungle. I am yours. You are mine. But I must help Rita. She is my friend. Friend, as Tarzan was Cheetah's friend... ...to help her when she was in the trap. - Trap? Yes, trap. No, darling, not a real trap... ...but just as strong, just as horrible. Jane want go? Don't you remember how you went when Timba was in the pit the tribes had dug? Jane want go? Tarzan, believe me... ...when the moon has made safari three times... ...three times, and when she comes out of the river, big and round... ...and looks in on us here, she'll find us as we are now. Together. And my safari will be over forever. And I will never go away again. Tarzan... ...and Jane. Understand? Understand. Bravo, Rawlins! Now let's see you strangle a lion. - I'm going with you. - Jane, darling! But first, I want today with Tarzan alone. - We need that for saying goodbye. - Yes, of course... ...but couldn't we go back to our old camp and leave this to you? No, Tarzan and I have a little Garden of Eden up the river. He's already gone there ahead to wait for me. - I'll be ready first thing in the morning. - Tomorrow morning? - You wanted to get away, didn't you? - That's right. Of course. Don't mind their laughing at you. I was much worse than you are when I started. Practice never made anybody perfect like he is, miss. I believe you think more of Tarzan than all the others do. Miss Jane, he's the finest gentleman I ever knew... ...trousers or no trousers. - Thank you. Tarzan would be proud of that. - I'd better get the natives started packing. - No hurry. - Hadn't I better get the cage down? - No, I'm leaving that here. There'll be no stopping for gorillas on the way. We have no other use for it now, have we? No, sir. But it's a very valuable piece of merchandise. What you sent all the way to Birmingham for. Go and see the boys have no thorns in their feet for tomorrow. Yes, sir. - And send Bomba to me. - Yes. Bomba! Captain Fry wants you. Bomba, listen. Out west where sun go down, great tribe. For safari, one day. Bomba move fast, half day. - Take boy and find chief. - How find chief? You'll find him, all right. What's the matter, you afraid? - Bomba no afraid. - Good. Tell chief bwana send. Bwana want chief for friend. Bwana want warriors to get through Gaboni country. Want spears, canoe, food. Bwana great, good friend of chief. - What bwana give chief? - Tell chief bwana take away juju. Take away great white ape. Tell chief bwana send one white man, two white women for juju. Well, get along there. Yes, bwana. You're sending Bomba on ahead, Captain Fry? Yes. It's always a good idea to scout out the country one intends to go through. - Oh, that was lovely. - Cold. - Oh, it was not. - Hot. - It was just right. - Just right? Just right. Tarzan, stop! Tarzan, don't. I'm tired. Tarzan, I'll fall on my face. Cheetah! Cheetah, stop it. Cheetah. Don't you behave yourself for one minute? Go on. Go on home. Go on home. Yes, and it'll serve you right if she tells her mother everything that's happened. Tarzan? Tarzan? Tarzan! Very well, then. Doesn't make any difference to me where you are. You see? I found you. You can't get away from me. I wouldn't squeal if this was the tallest tree in Africa... ...and there were 10,000 lions below. I squealed. - Jane. - Darling... ...I love you so much. Jane. Yes, Tarzan. Forever... ...and ever. Thank you, darling. - You see chief? - Yes, bwana. Chief say he do. - Get spears, canoes, everything? - Yes, bwana. - Get the men together. - Yes, bwana. - Good morning. - Good morning. Jane, where's Tarzan? He's not coming. He didn't want to say goodbye. Is there anything you'd like to get before we leave? No. Nothing. Jane, darling. I know just how you must be feeling. I'm all right. Wouldn't you like to go and say goodbye... ...to your lovely little house just for a minute? No. I'd much rather not. Miss Parker, join the main group with Rawlins. I'll be on the right flank with a few men, and Bomba will be on the left. We must take every precaution. Cheetah. Goodbye, Cheetah. Look after Tarzan when I'm gone. - You tired, Jane? - At this pace? Through the trees, I could be back with Tarzan in an hour. I'm sorry. Isn't it odd we haven't heard from Captain Fry? Yes, isn't it? - Do you suppose we lost our way? - Oh, no, miss. No, if we had gone off a straight line, we'd have run into Bomba or Captain Fry. On second thoughts, I think I'll look around a bit. Take good care of your sister and Miss Jane, sir. - Why, Rawlins, you talk as though... - Cheerio, sir. Bomba? You idiot, don't you understand you're heading the wrong way? - Way. - Why, you're barmy. - Now, face about and join the rest. - Bwana say go. - You're lying. - Bwana, he go. Oh, he did, did he? Now, suppose you just tell me what he went back for. Bwana no say. Well, I know anyhow. Bomba, you can't do it. Now, chuck Fry and, so help me... ...when we get home, I'll give you a new 5 pound note. I've got one. So help me, I have, Bomba. Bomba! You can't go and help Fry put him in a cage. Bwana, he say do. Oh, he did, did he? Well, he won't! You just wait until Tarzan comes leaping and roaring at you... ...and tear all your beast heads off. Where were you going, Rawlins? Captain Fry. - Fancy meeting you here. - Yes, we both seem to have strayed a bit. - You were going back, Rawlins? - Who, me, sir? Oh, yes, sir. I was just going back to get something... ...what I forgot while I was packing, sir. - What thing? - What? Well, you mean, what thing what I forgot, sir? Well, come along, then. - Oh, a locket, sir. - Oh, a locket. Yes, sir. A small, gold locket, sir. Oh, it's very valuable, sir. - A picture in it. - With a picture? Yes, sir. My mother, sir. - Well, cheerio, sir. - You've told me a dozen times... ...you were practically born in an orphan asylum. Well, I was, sir. But you see, as orphans, sometimes, sir, we... We like to have a picture that we can pretend that it's our mother, sir. Oh, this one was a very jolly-looking old lady, sir. Snow-white hair, sir. I picked her up cheap, sir. Fifteen bob at a secondhand shop in Whitechapel, sir. I shouldn't go, Rawlins. It might be dangerous. Yes, sir. But all the same, sir, I think I'd better go, sir. It will be dangerous, Rawlins. Yes, sir. - Tarzan, I've got a message. - Jane? Yes. Bad news, I'm afraid. I sort of hate to tell you this, but she's not coming back. Ever. Tarzan, she couldn't tell you herself. She asked me to tell you. Oh, I'm sorry, Tarzan, but you see... There's not much good talking, is there? Goodbye. Oh, Tarzan. Do you know any remedy for a poisonous snakebite? You know, snake. One of my safari boys. Where boy? Thanks. I'll show you. Bomba! Bomba! Here, you fools! Use your spears! That was very generous of you, Tarzan. Oh, I'm... I'm ashamed of myself. - I'll tell the others. - Others? Well, after all... Tarzan, try and not think too much about Jane. - Jane. - Well, you've a right to know the truth. Jane knew about this. I tell you, she knew about it! Jane. Jane want Tarzan in trap. Bomba, we've got him! Come out, you fools! He's safe now. Have Abdul tell the Hymandis chief we're on our way. Tell him we've got great white ape. Come on, get him up! Captain Fry, isn't this rather an unusual way of making a safari? - Unusual? In what way? - With Rawlins back there all those hours... ...wouldn't an advance guard be more practical? I have my own fussy way of doing things. The boys seem to be nervous about being in a strange country. Bomba! Push them along there. Hymandis. Bomba. Keep your nerve, everybody. Tell them want to see chief. Stay where you are and don't let them see that you're nervous. Bwana come. Tell chief bwana glad to be friend. Chief say glad bwana come. Get him one of those bags of salt. Tell chief give now spears, meat, canoes. Tell chief bring white men, two white memsahibs for juju. Tell the chief I've got the great white ape. Chief say bwana no got white ape. He got white ape. Tell chief I make juju. Chief say he make juju. Tarzan! Tarzan! Timba. Timba. Cheetah. Tarzan, I knew you'd come. Don't move before Tarzan gives the signal. - Did you hurt your arm, Rita? - No, it's my leg. - Tarzan, make a litter. - Litter? I'm all right, only a twisted knee. Don't walk. It'll be just as quick to carry you on a litter. Come on, Mr. Parker. We'll hold them as long as we can. - Hurting? - A bit. Captain Fry, come on. Quick! What did Tarzan mean by "ungatowa"? We're escaping through the cave where the swamp makes smoke. It's juju, forbidden. They'll never follow. This is the first time in Africa I haven't been able to see some sign of a bird. Thank heaven we're out at last. You can't let him do this. Tarzan. Well, haven't I the right to be heard? Escarpment. This is our way. The escarpment slopes gradually here. There are no savage tribes, nothing to trouble you going home. Going home. How nice that sounds. Tarzan. Tarzan? He's gone back. Yes, of course he's gone. What are we waiting for? Let's get the men together. - Bomba, safari. - Bomba, wait. We've hardly got time as it is to make camp before dark. - We can't do this to you any longer. - Rita, we've got to go. We lied to you about going back. You don't have to. I appreciate what you're doing, but let's go. My dear, it's true. Can you still write, darling? Because they'll accept your signature. And that's all we're taking back with us. Listen, there's something you've got to understand and try and forgive. You see, we wanted to take you back to where we thought you belong. "Civilization," I think they call it, but it's not for you. And even if your coming back meant that I'd inherit the world... ...I couldn't forget the look in Tarzan's eyes when he thought he would lose you. Stay here with your jungle flies... ...your funny little Cheetah and all the trouble she gets into and Tarzan. You've got the grandest possessions that any woman can have. Peace and comradeship... ...and perfect communion with a man who's devoted... ...to making your life beautiful. Don't you ever lose it.
