Thank you, honey you're a life saver. Okay, great. Who are they? CMF. Local band. And since Pilgrim are moving to L.A. to record their new album, ta da. Your new opening act. Very old school. About to break wide. They just signed with your label. Who's the drummer? I don't know. I, I think it was Joe. Joe, something. Oh, Joe. So you guys going to L.A., huh, to record? What are you gonna be, uh, freakin' movie stars now? [male voice speaks in Russian) Oh, Pamela! Come on, Daddy. They'll wait for you. Well. I'm not waiting for you. Get ready. Put me down for a 5:30 sound check. Thank you. Enzo. I don't need a sound check. We lip synch half the songs, remember? I could be sitting on my ass in my hotel suite with a bottle of Cristal right now. And a fistful of Vicodin getting ready to screw the bellboy. Instead, uh, uh, I'm... getting screwed by your fucked up schedule. Angie, shut up. Don't ever tell me to shut up. And don't call me Angie. It's Venus. Venus signs your checks. No, no, baby. I sign my checks. I'm your manager. Remember? That can change. Dear brother. Tonight's concert is no ordinary pop concert. This is a Command Performance requested by Russian president Dimitri Petrov. Performing tonight are hard rock veterans Pilgrim and the singer Irson. But, controversial American pop icon Venus is on top of President Petrov's list tonight. We have it on good authority that his daughters are big Venus fans. Irson. Irson, right here. Right here. We're here with singer Irson and the No Poverty Rocks Charity Concert in Moscow. Yes? Yes, Mother. Okay, well, I'm trying to get inside right now. Five thousand lucky audience members were selected by lottery. Broadcast worldwide, this concert will serve the public face of Russia's new No Poverty Rocks Campaign. The event is designed to publicize Petrov's new war on hunger in Third World countries, something the Russian president is determined to accomplish. This is Ali Connor, for Russia Now. Blue 7, we have them in sight. All clear. Welcome, Mr. President. It's great to see you again. Jim. You remember my girls? Anna and Yana. This is Mr. Bradley. The American ambassador to Moscow. My God, Alex, your eldest is the split image of her. I know. Isn't she beautiful? I, I didn't mean to bring it up. I'm, I'm I'm sorry, all right? It's been a long time since the book of love. I can't count the years of my life without love. That's beautiful. Is, was that, uh, was that Pushkin? Some American. Oh. Let's go meet some rock stars. We're inside the Moscow Centennial Arena, with the No Poverty Rocks Charity Concert. President Petrov and his family have just arrived, and are on their way to take their seats. Don't worry. I'll do every one of your favorites. Thank you! Pleasure to meet you. Hi. It's a pleasure. Good luck tonight. Thank you, sir. Believe me, I am great fans of the two of you. Sure. God, they love me here in Russia. You're the drummer for my new warm up act, right? Right. What's your name again? It's Joe. Hey, you want to party later? Look, with all due respect, um, you got a hell of a voice. Why waste it with this techno dance crap? Because I get a private jet, twenty dancers, and a 50 million dollar record contract. It pays the rent. Are you sure you wanna open up this tour for me? It pays the rent. Last time we were here was the, uh, ballet. Pushkin's Onegin was just a little bit different, huh. Just a bit. Champagne, sir? Identification, please? You want to know who I am? I'm tonight's star attraction. President Petrov has risen to power on a platform of fighting corruption and standing up to big business. He's immensely popular here in Russia. The man is practically a rock star in his own right. We're here with one of Venus's band members. Hi. What is your name? Joe. Love your outfit. So, are you excited about tonight? Yeah, um, Great. Me too. And what did the president have to say? Did he give you any pointers? Well, he, he said that, um, Thanks. Frank, we'll be back with more from the No Poverty Rock Concert in Moscow. Back to you in the studio. Thanks. You're cute. What is your name again? Um, yeah, it's Joe, from, uh... Yes, yes, I'm coming, okay. Copy that. Thank you, Moscow! Hey. You kicked ass out there. Thanks. Not bad for an older guy. Older guy! Yeah. Trying to keep up with you. Cool tattoos. Yeah, I like them. See you at the party later? Sure. Why not? By the way, what does CMF stand for? Cheap Mother Fucker. Named after our manager. Here she is, Venus! Venus, it's Venus, Daddy. Oh my God! What's up, Moscow! For my father. He love you both very much. For your father. All clear. All units, go, go, go. Form teams, move out. Come on. Impri is on the way. It's good we get a break. Three, two, one, go. Code Alpha. Code Alpha. Sir, we must get you and your family out immediately. What's going on? Security says we have to go. Go ahead, Jim. Go, go, go, go. He is one man. And wounded. Be patient. Wait for the prize. Stay behind me. Daddy! Yana! Anna! Stay back. Stay. Go back. Stop. Enzo! Enzo! Come on, move it. No!! Enzo!! Get back! backstage. Get backstage. Now. Come on, quick. Move. Joel Joel They're killin' everybody. The arena is under attack! I gotta stop this shit. Watch the hair, dude. Shoot! Move, move. Inside, everyone. Move. Over there everybody. In the corner, now You, move, move, come on. Take him, and him. These two in there. Sit down. Don't move. Take their phones. Up. Up! Ali Connor. I like your stuff on the Russia Now. You look much better in person. Much better. Anyway. I need you to set up your camera for a live feed to a network. Can you do that for me? It'll be a while. Just fucking do it!! Up!! Why'd you kill my brother? Why? Why? Shut the fuck up, bitch!! I don't have time for your shit. I'm here for bigger things than you little people understand. This is upper lobby. Go ahead. Building is secure. Phase one is complete. Go! He killed my brother and he hadn't done anything. Don't worry, it's going to be okay. The entrances are covered. Stand by. Okay. I'm ready for my close-up now. Sir. The men are in position, sir. They wait for your orders. Get up now. This way. Sir. Major. What's the tactical situation? No identification of the arms section as of yet. We've estimated approximately 200 casualties, including the President's security detail. All dead or captured. We have no communication with the interior of the stadium. Alpha Team's tactical unit has been deployed under Captain Simonov. Local army units from the Seventh Tank Division has secured the immediate area. As of 30 minutes ago, the whole city of Moscow is under military curfew. The President? His family? I'm afraid we don't know yet, sir. Attention! They may also have the American ambassador hostage. Should we bring the Americans and CIA in on this? Mr. Secretary? Not yet. General. Take a look at this. Comrades. This is addressed to the various intelligence agencies, who are no doubt trying to find a resolution to this situation. You can see the fruits of our labor onscreen. We have them all, including our beloved capitalist dictator, President Petrov, safe and uninjured, for now. We have contacted various news agencies and are providing them with a live update of the action here at the arena. Comrades, the entire world will be watching us. Who the hell's that lunatic? We don't know yet. But we'll find out. Great. The perimeter charges are set and primed. Take your men and sweep through the arena. Look for survivors. The only FSB Agents I want to hear about are dead ones. What if we find any civilians? Kill them. Why more dead civilians? We made our point. You're right. I'm sure we got everybody. We're moving down to clear stage area. Who's there? What do you think they want? Whatever it is, they're not going to get it. Quick negotiation exchange, this could all be over. My country doesn't negotiate with terrorists. Neither does yours. This doesn't happen in my country. Give it time. It will. Where are my daughters? Your daughters are my concern. Think of this as a little preview of what's to come. What is it you want? We can get you anything. A new Mercedes. Some fucking junk food. Flat screen TV. How 'bout that Venus bitch's latest CD? And you... can give me nothing but your pain. You were one of the great Soviets, Comrade Gordov. I learned my lesson back then. Ah, the Soviet Union worked. You pathetic little shit. He's lost too much blood. He needs a doctor. He needs a coffin. Upstairs on the main stage. Take the TV bitch and the video crew, get all this on tape. Give the media some table scraps. Traitors to the Mother Land. Bring your camera! Come visit my corner of hell, Kazov. I'll be waiting for you. Come on. Move. Move. Let's go. Get moving. Over there. Stand still. Set up in front of the speakers. Put them over there. Right here. Come here. Stand still. Here. Read this. You've done well. I'm proud of you. Are you filming? Hey! Come on. Rolling. Read. Come on, read it! The Russian security forces are being used by the selfish... and corrupt governments to protect private business interests. Therefore... we shall be the first sacrificial lambs, on Petrov's capitalistic altar. Comrades. We stand to awake... The world is watching. Don't stop. Oh my God. Three bursts. One of your men must have put up a fight. Good for him. Agent Kapista. Thank... Thanks for killing those bastards. Don't talk, sir. We'll get you some help. Get... it... Get our president out alive. And his children. I'm okay. That's the way out. The cameraman and the girl? Took off that way. You do speak English. Finally some good news. Mikhail Kapista, Presidential Security. And you? Joe. This way. Help me. Help. Over here. All right, get up. He- hey. N ice gig. I've got your CD. CD? Hey, come on. Pick him up, quick. Come on. Are you girls from Moscow? St. Petersburg. Where did you grow up? I grew up on a farm in Georgia. We have a place called Georgia in our country too. We thought you were from the mean streets of New York City. That's bogus P R crap from the label. I first went to New York City as a teenager. I was scared shitless. Like now. Scared shitless? That means really scared. What did you do? I put on this tough girl act. What happened? It made all the sharks scared of me. Sharks? Bad guys. You know, criminals. Bandits. I know. We'll act tough and that's how we'll get through this. Maybe we can get in contact with the outside security forces. They killed all your security guys? Yes. And the President? Last time I saw him, he was alive. They took him and his family. Wow, that's some catch. Venus and Petrov. I wonder who's worth more. He mentioned a CD? Yeah, that's right. What does it mean? I'm a rocker. A what? I play the drums. No. Keep it. I don't want it. Why? They'll come lookin' for this guy. Come on. Let's go. Let's get him down. We have to get him medical help. I know. So where did you learn hand- to-hand combat? I played a few rough joints, you know. Crazy chicks, fans, vodka. Fights. One last time. Who are you? I was in a bike gang. Back in California. Motorcycles. You know what that is? Yes, I know. That's why I know how to fight! You happy now? So why don't you want a gun? Look, I'm sorry about your buddy. The guy with the medal. Leonid Gordov. My Commander. He was a hero. A real hero. What's happening? Taking a break. We'll get you to a doctor. A transfer, in four equal parts, of one billion pounds sterling, into the four South African bank accounts mentioned previously. You have the account numbers. I fully expect confirmation of the monies transferred by zero hundred hours Moscow time. That's midnight to you civilians. Or I will systematically begin executing the hostages. Hello. Hello. Anything? No. They cut the lines. Shit. Wait a second. I will begin with the American pop princess, or our criminally inept president, or perhaps... perhaps... Perhaps one of his precious daughters. Major. Freeze on the subject. Give me a facial recognition scan. A billion pounds. At least he's not asking for a lot of money. Sir. Alpha in position. Good. That wasn't so bad, was it? See? I knew you had it in you. Send a patrol out to find Anton. He must be having fun with that TV bitch. Don't even think about moving. Approaching, taking position. Alpha One. I wish we had someone on the inside. Major. This is Agent Mikhail Kapista. Maybe we do. Agent Mikhail Kapista. President Petrov's close security team. Just assigned this morning. First day, Agent Kapista? It's a very difficult tactical situation for us, sir. They're all dead, as far as I know. Yes, sir. No. Just me. Well, there's one more person. A drummer. That's correct. An American musician, sir. Well, uh, he used to be in... No, sir. Absolutely not. I'm dead serious. Yes, sir. There's got to be an exit up here somewhere. I don't know. Maybe we should've stayed back there. Those two guys seemed friendly at least. They killed those fucking terrorists. A Three to Base. Lobby's clear. Who knows who the hell's who anymore? All I know is that if we make it out with this news footage, we'll never have to work again. Shit, shit... Sh. Quiet. Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here. No. Oh, fuck this. Fuck this. No. Hey, stop! Bloody hell. That was close. The cameraman escaped. He's been neutralized I'm heading back to the stage. We'll be back soon. The important thing is for you to stay here and stay quiet. Don't make a sound. Do you understand? Just listen to some tunes and relax, okay? Rock and roll, Joe. Don't move. Turn around. Against the wall. You know I don't like guns. They kill people. You think you're funny, huh? You wanna hear something funny? Three Colombians came to our apartment one morning to collect a debt. My brother was shot in the chest. Seven times. I found the guys who did it. Since then I've been trying to stay away from these things. They told me to arrest you. Well, in case you haven't noticed, I'm on your side. I noticed. Hey. You want this back? Yes. Sorry. After you. They want to talk. Who wants to talk? The bandits inside. I am General Voroshilov, Internal Security Command. What do you want? Certain parties are interested in making a deal with the authorities. What kind of deal? Safe conduct. Immunity. For who? Can you approve a deal? For who? Can you approve a deal? I can approve a deal. What are you bringing to the table? Motivations. Key players. An escape route for me and my partner. And, a way for your Alpha to get inside. Wait! We will be in touch. How do I contact you? I don't know. I wish I knew. But they're hiding something. You know these Russians. Attention. Someone on the inside wants immunity. To make a deal. Please. Lay it out for us, General. Names, dates, and a way inside. They said they'd get in touch with the details. When? It is now twenty-two hundred. We can't wait that long. The execution deadline set by the bandit leader is coming up, and, uh, sooner or later, I have to send in the Alpha Team. How do they get in? Captain? Captain Siminov. These two gentlemen are from the CIA. Three-phase assault. Through the front of the building using tanks. A helicopter insertion over the roof. And an infantry foot assault through the underground access tunnels. Still giving the terrorists time to kill hostages. No. We gotta buy more time. The U.S. government would like to explore this offer, General. In the meantime, all that's standing between the terrorists, a dead U.S. ambassador, an even deader Russian president, is a green security agent. Oh, and a fucking drummer. Sir. This just came in from the FBI. You've gotta be kidding. Jesus Christ. Let's wait for the deal. One hour maximum. Security office. Perfect. N ice shooting. Forgot some of their toys. I've got something over here. As we've seen in the past, the Russian government will not negotiate with terrorists. I know this room. It's the main rehearsal room behind the stage. Didn't you rehearse down there? We don't rehearse. We just play. Go on. Move. Sit. Any problems? Anton is dead. I want you to get out. Get out? They need help. We all need help. You can get it for us. I'll never make it out. They'll kill me. There is a good chance we're all going to die down here. We have to help my children. You're the only one they're not watching all the time. Wait for my signal. Send out another patrol. Strip the arena. Soon, they will pay. And one man won't make a difference. Or will it? Come. Take a drink. I don't drink. Drink! You'll need it. I haven't had a drink in 18 years. Drink. No. No, no, please. Drink! Swallow! It is eleven thirty PM. The next deadline, One billion sterling. Don't look, children. Just so the world knows... I'm very, very serious. No stomach for our work, my old friend? Now they have no reason to negotiate. They will be here soon. We have to rescue those hostages. I can't do it by myself. The guys who killed your brother. That's why you don't want to use a gun? No. I'm okay. Forget about that. I'm gonna have to stop running away, and go after these mother fuckers ourselves. I'll take over. Come on, get up! Daddy! No, no, no. Daddy! Go ahead. Be a hero. The singer is gone. What are you waiting for? Comrades. Are you ready for the grand finale? And, as they say in the concert business, seating is limited. This'll get us to the rehearsal Room. Let's go. So this is the old Joe. Yeah. Scary, huh? Joe. You okay? You're not hurt? They killed my brother. And the American Ambassador. We know. They've got the president and the girls. Oh, we've got to get help. Look, I got a hell of a recording deal comin' up with your label. None 'a these assholes are gonna stop me. Okay. You two finished? You're going with us. Let's go. Trying to figure out how to spend all that money, huh? On wine or women. I'll stick with women. Hey, uh, you guys, you're part of Anton's mob, right? No, we work for Vladimir. I know. Relax. Taking your evening exercise, friend? I was looking for... the escape route. You're not even close. Follow me. Where? This way. Come. The tunnel? Think I was lying to you? This tunnel. It leads to, uh, the subway system. From there we could get out? Exactly. Why did you talk to the General? Oleg, it's not what you're thinking. From my father. To a traitor. Alpha Team standing by in position. Hold for Comrade. Command fire Delta approved. Confirm Alpha Leader. This is Alpha Team Leader. Confirmed. Wait for Go Team now. The bullets on these, it's not worth my time. What is this? Sledge. We can't wait on our inside contacts much longer. Sir, I think I found something. Oleg Kononov, a Russian national who immigrated to the U. S. in the early nineties, got arrested for some petty crimes in the U.S. Why did he go crazy like this? Money? I think because of his real name. His real name? Can I get access to Soviet Ministry of Defense personnel records? Circa 1990, 1992. That's classified, Major. Do it. That's one hell of a climb. The Rehearsal Room is up there. How many entrances? Two, I think. We'll split up when we get to the top. What about me? You know how to use this? Let's go. Let's go. How long until the deadline? Thirty-five minutes. The finance ministry is standing by to transfer the funds. This is not going to matter if our bandit leader wants what I think he wants. Those hostages will be dead very, very soon. You said his name had some significance. The last name, Kazov. Ring a bell? Oleg Kazov. Current age should be forty-four. Former Captain in the Red Army for three tours in Afghanistan in the late-eighties. Highly skilled Special Forces Operative. Marshal Kazov. World War II hero in Stalingrad. Former Soviet Minister of Defense. And a leader of the failed Coup against Gorbachev in '91. Then who is Oleg Kononov? Oleg supported his father in the Coup, but after his parents committed suicide, Oleg immigrated to the U. S. He changed his last name to Kononov. According to the passport records, he reentered the Russian Federation three weeks ago. Prosecutor of Oleg's father and the other Coup members. A young judge from St. Petersburg. We know him now as... President Alexi Petrov. Here you are, sir. Priority Bravo One. Get me Alpha Team Leader. This is not about the money. This is about the revenge. Kazov will never let the President out of that arena alive. Send in the Alpha Team. Now. What now? We'll go one way... you the other. How many men in there? Now we'll find out. Follow me. Standing by. The singer? Sent three men, haven't heard back. So there must be a couple more FSB Agents still breathing. We have movement here. Something's up. Kazov here. Anything? When do we make our move? Did we get the money? Soon. Anna. What are you doing? Take me instead. Daddy! No. No. Get off me! Stop it! No! Help me! Get off me! No! No! Get off! Kazov? Wrong. Thank you. You're safe now. I have a little bedtime story. A story about honor. About patriotism. About losing everything a man loves. It's a story you will enjoy. Come here. Daddy! Daddy! It's okay. It was a warm summer. 1991. I was home on leave from my military service. And my father, Marshal Dimitry Kazov, you may have heard of him. He was watching television. The door suddenly flew open and a team of Special Forces troops burst in. And eagerly running at their heels, was a young prosecutor. Shoot anyone coming through that door. Bad guys. You got 15 rounds. Keep shootin' till they fall down. Hey. You stay there. Joe! Don't get killed. When this is over, I wanna renegotiate my royalty rate. May need your contacts. How can you talk about business at a time like this? Those bastards are trying to kill us. Dying is easy. Rock 'n roll is hard. You can't go back to the old ways. Something your father never learned. My father was a patriot. So am I. What about our escape? Where are your guts, soldier? You remember that night, Prosecutor? Your father was treated with dignity. Let us go and you will be treated likewise, I promise. My mother knew what the sound of the boots on her front steps meant. She looked at him one last time. One last time. As he aimed the cold barrel of his revolver at her forehead. And fired! Before I could stop him, he already had the gun on himself. Do you remember how he spit at you before he pulled the trigger? He's transmitting again. The time has come for a reckoning! This is not a political statement. This is not a religious statement. This is blood for blood. Help me! Help me! No! Yana! Down. You okay, dude? I mean, sir. Clear. Daddy! Are you okay? Where's Kazov? He took the girl with him. That way. He won't go up. Not with an Alpha Team moving in. Probably down through the boilers and then to the service entrance. I'll take you there. Get the others out of the building. What about you, sir? Get yourself and the rest of them out. I'm getting in. My job is to... Go. That's an order. Yes, sir. It's time to finish this! Where are the others? Is my father and Yana all right? Don't worry. They'll be out soon. And Joe? Enough. Let's go. We have to get out now. Thank God. I've been looking for you guys. This way. Come on. Hurry. That's for my brother, you fucking piece of shit! Russian military! Stay down! It's the Alpha Team! Stay down! I'm Ali Connor. Stay down! Don't move! I'm a journalist. I have important footage for you. Stay down! Wait. Hold your fire. You! Don't move! I'm Agent Kapista, Presidential security. Put down your weapons! Crawl Crawl over here or I'll blow us all to hell right now Daddy! It's going to be all right. It is not going to be all right! Crawl! Crawl! Kneel at my feet! Crawl!! Kneel! How does it feel, Mr. Prosecutor? How does it feel? Well, I guess the show's over. No encores, I hope. Rosa. In the days of the Great Patriotic War, we had a decoration called Hero of the Soviet Union. It was only given under very special circumstances, and usually to the family of the recipients, because the soldier had already given his or her life to serve the nation. However, in 1992, Senior Agent Leonid Gordov, did receive a similar decoration for saving a new and fragile federation, from a malicious coup attempt. His family thought Leonid would want you to have this. On behalf of the Russian people, for conspicuous bravery in the face of grave danger, I proclaim you... Hero of the Russian Federation. Joe, can you autograph these, please? I thought you two were Venus fans. Don't tell her. Promise. It reminds me of a band I once knew. For you, Joe. Thanks. Check the back. Thanks. So how's the shoulder? Doing okay. I can still kick ass. And play the drums. Good luck. You too, Agent Kapista. You know, we could probably use a man like you in the Security Services. Rock and roll star. Perfect cover. Thanks, but, um... today I got a better gig. Hey. You coming? I'm still looking for an opening act. So am I. Rock and load.
