Yeah, I know you are. I want to say thank you, Mr. Randall... for school, for write me. - Oh, it was... it was nothing. - It... everything... for me. I learn English. I can read... read your life. And your picture cards. Yeah, the postcards, yeah. I bring gift for you, but... - they take it. - Yeah, the... the screws would take it. - No... the guard. - Yeah, the screws security-check everything. Did they, um... secure each of my letters, too? - How'd you get here? - Motor bicycle. Very fast. But... "Cow." Honda. - H-h-how'd you know I was here? - Your brother... uncle Gary. Right. "Uncle Gary." - So, what do you want? - Want? - Yeah. I- I... I- I don't understand. Nothing seem like your words. - Nothing looks same... no like picture cards. - What do you want? I want to see you. I want to see Mrs. Jenny, Aiden, Maggie. They aren't real, okay? - Wh... what this mean? - It means they don't exist. - Why? You really shouldn't have come here, you know? Sorry, Miss. Visit's over. Visiting a prison can be a very confronting experience. Everything is wrong. I ask stupid questions. Ah, it's probably not your fault. Mr. Randall doesn't get many visitors. Everything is wrong. My car is over there. Well, technically, she's got to be missing for 48 hours before she's considered missing. - But she is missing! - Not technically. - Hey, mate. How'd you go? - Hey, good, mate. - Fletch is in the office. - Thanks. - How'd you go? - Yeah, good. Um... Mrs. MacNeil lost her job, so she missed a payment, - but she said she could pay next week, at the latest. - Stupid woman. She'll get her husband killed if she's not careful. - Hey, Brian. Good. Good. - Dad, she said she could pay next week. Can't you tell the guys to leave him alone... Yeah. No, cool. Just one... MacNeil. Yeah. Yeah. You are not gonna let them bug you... do you understand? - Get back to your cell. - Tommy. - Ta-ta. You sprung? It's MacNeil's wife. Hands up, MacNeil. - It's your warning. - Please, no! You know the rules. Get him up, Dwight. Now, you listen to me, all right? You tell wifey on the outside that she respects my timetable, and then I'll respect you. You understand? Then we won't have all this nonsense. You didn't see anything, okay? Hey! He asked you a question. Leave him alone, Brian. He's okay. His brother always pays on time. - How many years have you known Mr. Randall? - Many years. We talk in letters... and picture card. Ah. Nice. - And did he ask you to come to Australia to visit him? - No. - I come with orphanage. - Orphanage? - We sing for choir festival. - Oh, right. I love music. My daughter plays the piano really beautifully. Unfortunately, she's... she's given it up. - Thank you. - That's okay. Go inside! She has disobeyed the regulations. All meeting with sponsors should be organized through our orphanage. - It's a waste of our time. - I'm sorry. It won't happen again. There's no evidence that my client was involved in MacNeil's beating. I'm aware of that. This protection-money racket, cashish... Is this the head guy, Tommy Fields? Would help your chances at your parole hearing. We'd look after you. Very well, then. If you change your mind, contact Mrs. Crenaugh. Make sure Mr. Randall participates in outdoor activities and weekly excursions. I'd like the parole board to consider the fact that my client has been sponsoring a child for many years. Haven't you? In China? I've met her. She's a nice kid. Um, if you want to see more of her, I would consider the deputy director... She won't be coming back. Mr. Randall? Can I call you "Dean"? Uh, what happened on the bus this morning? - It's in the Doctor's report. - Yeah, I read it... "Self-sabotage." You know, Dean, it's not uncommon for you to be feeling anxious about your parole. It's a big change in your life. Do you want to make an appointment, and we can have a chat, or... - I can arrange some counseling for you? - You didn't have to mention the girl. Well, should I mention you're a park ranger, then? Um, she left this in my car. 10 years, you've been writing to her and sending her money, she told me. - So?! - Why? I don't know. It's just something to do. "There's a family of eagles nesting in the bush near where we live. I love watching them fly. They do kill to survive, but they also play. They certainly know how to protect their young. If you ever come to visit, I'd love to show you our beach, and where the animals come to feed." - "...the animals come to feed. - You'd like it here. And you can bring the other children, too. We'd love to hear you sing." "We'd love to hear you sing." That's it for today. Time for sleep. Not yet. We want to sing. Yes, we want to sing. All right. Let's sing "Two Tigers". 'Dong Ying' 'Children's Choir' Good morning, Miss Chen. - Miss Chen. - See me downstairs after practice. From the top again. Go on - one, two, three... I've packed your bags. - Miss Chen? - It's arranged. You fly home today. Big sister, please don't go. Right, you lot. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Out. It's an order. Get out there now. Come on. Come on. - Throw it up here, mate. - Oi. Hey. I heard they, uh, they got you into a little talk. Anything I should know? Are you deaf, Dean? Tommy! Tommy! - Are we playing or what? - Go ahead. I'll be there. He has helped me for years. I just wanted to see him... He didn't reply to you. He doesn't want to see you. How do you know? Little Sister, you're 16. How can you be so naive? You always get so carried away. You have no idea how complicated the world is. If you can't appreciate why I'm doing this... - something is wrong with you. - Yes, something is wrong with me! A person without a name isn't a real person... That's enough! Mei Mei! Mei Mei! # Happiness is just a little thing # Humans mostly are too large for it # If you cannot feel the joy of spring # Shrink yourself, and maybe then you'll fit # Happiness is just... # Make the beamers (BMW) a priority. Keep your eyes open for the other ones, huh? Beamer. (BMW) Right-o. - Be good. - Yeah. Yeah? Ah. G'day, mate. How are you? - Make sure that it's straight. - Yep. - Hold it. - Hold on to the wheel. Grab the brace. - Okay. - Good. They want to know if I can still stay with you when I... - when I get out. Is that okay? - Yeah, of course. Where else would you stay? - I don't know. - Come on. Time. They've got those halfway houses and... I haven't seen you for ages. Yeah, sorry. That place freaks me out. I've been, uh, you know... busy. Yeah, you must have been. It's been, like, eight months. Hey, look, I have been busting a gut trying to organize things for you. Yeah, all right. Hey, um... I need you to come in today, if you can, and sign something for my welfare officer. What, you... what, you want me to just drop everything? - It's for the parole hearing. - Yeah, all right. All right. I'll, um... - I can do it after lunch. - Okay. Thanks. I'll let her know. - Get off, mate. - Right-o. - Yeah? - I want to see 'cow.' Cow? Cow? Like a... like a moo cow? Like a... "moo"? Moo-moo! Oi! - Hello, 'Cow.' - Ah... "cow." - Uh, um... back off, Dave. - Mm. This is Dave. Don't worry about him. I'm gonna break for lunch. - Yeah, sure you are. - Hungry? Hm? Yeah? - You want to grab something to eat, or...? - Uh, I want see Mr. Randall. What... right now? Yeah, look, I don't know how they do things in China, but... I'm not a taxi service. Hey. - You just want to put your arms around me again, don't you? - Oh! Sorry. After you. I tried calling your brother. He's not answering. I meant to say the other day, it's really admirable what you've done... sending donations to that child for so long. Might tell my other clients about it. I don't reckon Gary's gonna show up. Because many of my clients need my help, to rebuild their lives after parole... form connections again. Why don't you go down to the workshop? I'll page you if your brother turns up. She ran away from me. I spoke to the police again. They won't do anything for 48 hours. What about the Canberra concert? Children, come over. Something urgent has come up. You go ahead with Miss Fong. - Yes, Miss Chen. - Good, get in the bus now. - Yeah, good job. - Yeah. - Yeah, turned out well. Yeah! M.I.N. number is 256904, report to the visitors hall. M.I.N. number 256904. Hey, visitor? Christmas, is it? You're up. You coming? Hey! - Oh. Um... screw bring gift? - Yeah. Yep. Thanks. Panda bring you good luck. And the CD is our choir, but about five year old already. Uh... I didn't think I'd... see you here again. I stay here. - Where? - Here... Australia. - What for? - You are alone. Me too. - Now we no more alone. - Yeah... but... w-w-where you gonna live? - Who's gonna look after you? - You look after me already... many years. - Now I can look you. - No, no. I mean... - How are you gonna cope? - You no want me stay? - You don't know anybody. - I know uncle Gary and his friend. Uncle Gary doesn't have any friends, okay? All right? He... He has alibis. Do you know what that means? That means you'll end up like me, in a place like this. Why are you in place like this? You never said anything to me about y-y-your parents in any of your letters and what happened to them. - What... what happened to them? - Don't know. Don't care. - They don't want me. I don't want them. Okay? - Would you shut up?! Dad, I want to go! All right. I've always liked the name "Mei Mei." It's... it's good. It's... it's a cute little name. "Mei Mei" mean "Little sister." Not even real name, you know. I big now. I can find a stronger name myself. "Mimi." That's right. "Mimi" is a bigger name. I no more crying "Little Sister," like that one! - Hey, I told you... shut up! - No! - Hey, leave her alone, will you? - Both of you, sit down! - Or what, bigmouth? You two... outside, or the visit's over. Hey! Hands off! She's just trying to help, okay? - You don't like outside? - Uh... Children cry. No one listens. That father no good. He no listen her cry. Yeah. Look. Like your picture card. Can I come tomorrow? For the buses, okay? A- and tell them my M.I.N. number, which is 256.. - ... 904. Yeah. Yeah. Why... why you always go first? Aah! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Well, they've already left for Canberra, but they said they'll be back on sunday for the Sydney concert, so... Do you Miss them? Your friends? Yeah? Well, it can't be all that bad. I mean, you like our beaches, right? Yes. I've never been to beach before. How old are you, Mimi? I old enough. You know, you shouldn't be so trusting of everyone. You shouldn't even trust me. Who's coming in the water? But definitely don't trust these idiots. - You're going in the water! - No! Aah! - Put her down, Dave! - No! Carl! - Hey! Put her down! - Let me down! Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Whoo-hoo! All right. Come on. Open the door, babe. Open the door. I got to pee. - Yeah, this is it. This is our place. - Open the door, babe. - I'm going! I'm going! - Hurry!

One tooth go bye-bye, and other wanting to go, too. I learn ABCs. I learn good because I want to read your words and see your face. Mr. Randall, I tell you everything... Things I no tell others. You always there... hear my words. Friends come, friends go with new parents. I no see them no more... but I see you. Miss Chen, she says maybe I was born in the year of the fire dragon. Yours truly, Mei Mei." # Happiness is just a little thing # Humans mostly are too large for it # Anna, I've already paid for it, and you can't even thank me. There is nothing wrong with this model. Mine's still working, and it's been two years. Calm down. It is just a mobile phone. "Controlling"? He said that? Well, you can tell your father that that is because I know... Oh, God. Anna? Ah, Mr. Randall. Can I... how can I help you? Um, to be honest, I have no idea whether you can legally sponsor a child to stay here. Yes, there would be legal restrictions, but, yeah, I can check. Okay. - Hey, Dean. Burned Robert yesterday. - I didn't say anything. - You didn't say anything about what? - About anything. Hold yourself up. Hold yourself up. Hold yourself up. Hey. Hey. Listen to me. This is just a warning, all right? 'cause I care about you. I do. You stay quiet. Okay. Now...

That no good. You must look after yourself. Yeah. You sound like my mum did. Well, except with a funny accent. Uh... got some more money for you. - No, no, no. No need to give me money. - I work already. - You work already? - Doing what? - Wash car. - I clean inside, outside. I clean good. - Huh. Yeah. I bet you do. Y- you sing pretty good, too. I, um, listened to that CD. - It's good. - Old songs. - I sing no more. My voice not the same. - Ah. You said in one of your letters that, um, Miss fong told you... I think when you were about 14... that you were too old to sing anymore, right? And... and that you want to be a conductor now. Yeah? Well, that... that sounds good. Oh! My job! I come sometime tomorrow. Yep. Ah, so, you're the first one to leave today, huh? We going? - You call the hostel again, please? - Uh, yeah, I already called them. They just said the same thing... sunday. No, but, hey, hey, hey. Don't worry about them. Worry about yourself. Eh? - Dad. - What? - About that course I was... - I was talking to you about... - I already said no, didn't I? Well, I could still do the collection rounds for you, and I get a student allowance, so I wouldn't need any money. Where's that course gonna get you? - Well, chefs make good money, dad. - Hey. Come here. Have a look at this. You walk straight into it. It's all yours if you want it. Dave. Do you like girls, Carl? - No, no. Don't touch that! - What? What did you say? What? - Quit mucking around, Dave. Get the car painted. - Yeah, we're on it, mate. - Change it... metallic silver. - Yeah, got it. Good. Higher up. - What are you doing? Take it off! - I'm changing the plate. - No, no. We're spraying the car first. You told me to change the plate... I changed the plate. No, no, no. I come all the way down here to help you out. - I don't want to touch stolen cars... - No. Ruby, Ruby. - I don't want to touch them in the first place. - Shh! Take a seat. Thanks. - So, what was that all about? - What do you mean? - Parole hearings can be quite... - No. Not that. What was that crap about you testifying against Tommy? - Don't worry. It's not gonna happen. - Then why were they asking? - 'cause they... - Gary... Gary, you were an asset in there. Now the parole board knows that your brother has somewhere to stay and that someone's gonna be looking after him. Hey, any more news about the immigration lawyer? Yeah. You can't sponsor he because of your record, but he can organize a visa for her and look for a foster family. - All right. - But it's not cheap. It's $2,000. Shut up, will you? Shut up. All right, well, tell him to do it. - He'd need an establishing fee of $500. - That's okay. And, as I said, you can't be seen to be sponsoring her. - It would have to be anonymous. - Yeah, that's fine. That's good. Mrs. Crenaugh, can you come here for a moment? Immigration? The Chinese chick? - Listen, can you take 500 bucks out of my money? - Your money? - Yeah. - Mate, your money ran out six months ago. - Why? - You keep stuffing up your parole. - What are you talking... There is no money there, okay? I am the one who has been paying... - ... overheads in here. - Yeah, but... - Do you understand? - After all I've done for you. - What you've done for me? - I took the rap for both of us, okay? - I'm the one keeping you alive in here. It's 500 bucks. Can you do it or not? - Not if I have to pay Tommy, as well. - Don't worry about that. I'll sort that out. Just make sure you get the money to her. You are lucky Fletch has got a big job coming up. W- why are you still doing stuff with him? You're an idiot. Where do you think I'm gonna get the money from? Jesus, Dean, grow up. You can come in now. Thank you for waiting, Mr. Randall. The board has reached a decision. Parole is granted. You'll be released two weeks from today. Well, I'll tell you what I am concerned about... I'm concerned about Fletch taking more money than we've agreed upon. You're the one on the phone talking to him. If the phone's tapped, it won't be going down. It'll be you. - I know, Tommy. - So this is your problem, not mine right? - All right. Tommy? Tommy? Yes, Dean? Man, I have to be a bit late with the next cashish, I think. Maybe... tuesday, if that's all right? Is he for real? I mean, are you for real? I just heard you're getting out soon, Dean. And now you're trying to wiggle out of your last payment. Don't do it. Toddle off, Dean. Away you go. - For the beamer. - Thanks. - You good for tuesday night? - Yeah. What is it? - Two this time. - Sweet. How's your brother? Yeah, he... good. Good. Gets out in a couple weeks. Fast pair of hands, your brother. Business expanding... be a real asset. I'll tell him you said hi. Don't take all bloody day on that thing. Okay, Mr. Fletch. We do quick. - Hey. - Oh! Oh, sorry. Thank you. - Is that your daughter? - Yeah, that's right. I've, um... got the, uh... - ... $500. - Oh. Terrific. - Thank you. I'll pass that on. - Count it if you want. No, that's okay. Thanks. You all right? - Yep. Good night. - 'Night. Hello-o-o-o-o. All right. - Hey. - Hi. - Come up. - N-no. Ah, come on, Mimi. Got to learn to ride sooner or later. Hop up. Right. What you want to do is put both your hands on the handlebars. Yep? All right. And what you got to do is when I turn, you lean. - Okay? - Okay. - All right. - So, when I turn, you lean. Ready? - Oh. - Lean. - Nice. All right. Gonna go left. Ready? - Mm-hmm. Lean. Good! - And turn... whoa! - Aah. - Got to lean a little bit. - Okay. - Okay? - Aa-aa-aa-aah! Ow! - Ow! Ow! - Is she okay? - Yeah. Nice work, Carl. Paint job's not bad, either. All right, kiddies, it's just like Christmas. - Hey! - Pizza! - There you go. - Thank you, Fletch. Now, Ruby. - Ah. - Dave. - Thanks, mate. And Mimi. Aw, no, no, no. You keep that. That's yours. But... look. That's a lot of money, Mei Mei. Who are you working for? Rich man. Nice. Lots of cars. He take our business. What kind of business is it? Is it legit? Put that away, will you? Is it legal? I work hard. Money's for us. I not break a law. Yeah, how do you know? You sure? Put it away! You not believe me. - Well, just seems a bit suss, that kind of money. - Why you no believe me? I always tell you everything in letters. No lie. Always tell truths. But you? Picture cards all wrong... No Mrs. Jenny, no Megan, no Aiden. And here? - You don't tell me why you're here. Why? - You want to know why I'm here? You want me to tell you? Because I killed someone, okay? Now, all we had to do was burn down a print shop, and we were gonna make a lot of money. That's what Gary's mate reckoned. I'm sorry. You know, the whole time, I had a bad feeling about it. But I just wanted that money. So, you know, I just pretended everything was all right. There wasn't gonna be anyone in that building, they reckoned. Mr. Randall. He died, Mei Mei, that old man. It was my fault. Yes. But you have paid. Oh, I don't know about that. And you have give me a good life. We've got to live a good life. - And not be doing things that make you feel bad. - I don't feel bad. Look, Mrs. Crenaugh's gonna try and help you, okay? It's complicated, but s-she's gonna try and find you a family, - and we're gonna take care of you. - A family? - Yeah. But... you are my family. - You don't want me? - No, no, no. It's not that. You see, legally, I... What I'm trying to say is, you're gonna be taken care of. All right? When I get out of here, I'm gonna come and see you. All right? I'm gonna get out of here in two weeks. - Two weeks? - Yep. So happy! I will go to work. You will see. I can make money. I will help you. In two weeks, you will see. - That... t-that's him! - Oh, yes! That's him! That's him! - Nope. - Can't you help us out? - You have to calm down. Hey, Gary. So, my place, 8:00, yeah? Two items. Two different locations. Yeah. Right. Done. Dad, I want to do one. Seriously? You reckon you're up to it? I'm not doing it for free, though. Exploiting your old man, are you? Don't worry, kid. You'll get your cut, you do a good job. You saving up for a new bike? No. I'm gonna go do that... That course I was telling you about. Did you get the money to my welfare officer? Yeah, yeah, yeah. She got it. How'd you go with the, uh... the other thing? You know... Tommy? Oh, good. Yeah. Spoke to him, and, you know, it's fine. He'll wait. All right. Well, I don't, uh... I don't think you'll have to wait long. Got a big job tonight. I don't want to know about it. - Thought you were all right with Fletch now. - Why would you think that? Well, the Chinese chick... didn't you set her up with him? What are you talking about? Yeah, well, that's where she's working... helping Fletch with the cars. All right. Got to go. Here you go. What's the urgency? I want to testify. Oh. Against Tommy Fields? Yep. Good. That's good. Um... why did you change your mind? What difference does it make? I mean, that's what you want, isn't it? Well... I'm glad. Um, I'll... I'll let the deputy director know. The thing is, I-I have to get out today, okay? - Uh... I don't think that that's possible. - Oh, come on. I mean, he can make it happen if he wants. You people are doing deals all the time, right? Okay. I'll try. I am here to help you. - Nice! All right, wait. If you lift up the black thingy and then scrub right underneath... - Hey. - Hey. Mimi, want to come on a joyride with us tonight? Joyride? This will be fun. - Okay. - Good girl. I want you to check through the transcript of your statement for accuracy. Uh, my client will need a decree of protection before he's released. You did the right thing. Thank you, Mr. Randall. I didn't do it for you, mate. Well, I didn't. Bring it back. Got you covered. No, you've got to get over it, and like that. See? Tommy. You-know-who has been talking. Open up! Open up, will ya! - Hurry up! - Paperwork? - Here. I'll be seeing you later, Randall. Did you hear that? Mimi? What is she doing here? We get her hands dirty, she's part of the team. She's part of us. Understand? - This was not part of our deal, dad! - Deal? Which particular position are you dealing from, Carl? You wanted to come. You're in or you're out. Uncle Gary! What's going on? - You know her? - How you do, uncle Gary? That's, uh... that's Dean's kid. The... the kid he sponsors. - You knew this? - What's going on? What's she doing here? Let's go. - You all right? - Yes. Well... good luck. - Okay. Who wants to do the honors? - Here, I'll... - I'll do it. - You up for it? - Come on. - No, it'll be all right. Carl, what's this? - You... what are you doing? - It's got nothing to do with you, Mimi. You want to steal that car? - It'll be okay. - No. - It'll be all right. - That's wrong. You no can do that. That is... this is bad. - Hey, Mimi. Mimi. Shut up and let him do his work, yeah? - No, that's wrong! - It'll be okay! It'll be all right! - Shut up! - You gonna do it? - Mate, come on. Let's just call this off. We should not have brought the kids. Hey, there's nothing wrong with my kid, mate. Just leave it. - You will be like Mr. Randall. You will be inside... - You don't understand! - Just stay in the van. - Don't go. Are you gonna do it? - Yeah. - No! Don't! Don't! Stay in the van. - This feel no good. - Shh! No good? - "Feel no good"? - Shh. Come on. What's that supposed to mean... "no good"? You bad father! Come on, mate. Seriously, mate. - Fletch! - I said shut up! Come here! Just had it! - Ow! - Uncle Gary! - Right! Come here! Come on! - No! No! Uncle Gary! - I told you to shut up in there! - No! - In the back! Go on. - No, no. - Ow! - Stay there! Get in! Get in the back! Stay there! - Uncle Gary! - Shut up! - Uncle Gary! Uncle Gary, you help me! Mr. Fletch! This is wrong! - Get me out! - Hey! I'll punch your lights out if you don't shut up. - Just ignore her. Blue 'Beamer' (BMW), right? - Yeah. The automatic. Get on with it. Dave? Where's Mei Mei? - Who the hell are you? - I'm Gary's brother. Where is she? Um... uh, uh, she's with my dad at the car yard. - Okay, well, you got to take me there. - I can't, man. The car's hot. I don't care! She's in trouble, all right?! Come on! That should be down in the garage! - Dean. - Where is she? - I don't know what you're talking about. - I'm here! Where is she?! - What are you doing?! - Just tell me where she is! You'll bloody ruin everything! I don't know! I told your brother! - Come on, Fletch! - I don't want to hear... - Gary! Hey, Gary! Bring it back in now! I just want Mei Mei! - You're gonna ruin it! - Where are you?! - Security 1 to base. I need the Police. - Roger that, security 1. - Dad! Dad, get off of him! - Where is Mei Mei?! You shouldn't have brought him here! You're gonna bugger everything up as usual, you bloody idiot! - No! No! I'm here! - Mei Mei? - Mei Mei?! - Where is Mei Mei? Mei Mei, just wait! I'll get you out! - Mr. Randall! - Dad! Dad! Dad! Stop! Let her go! Just wait, Mei Mei. - Dad! Dad! Dad! - Let go of me! - Stop! All right, it's over! Just stop! - Let go of me! - It's over! You're an idiot! Hey! - Hands behind your back. - All right. Run! Go! Ugh! No! Stop! Not him! Stop! Stop! - All right, hands behind your back. You're under arrest. - No! - Stealing cars? - I didn't steal anything. I got you out of here this morning, and now you are straight back in here! You don't understand. Mei Mei was in trouble. I was just trying to help her! This is so disappointing. Do you realize that the lawyer has almost finalized Mei Mei's temporary visa? Where is she? Is she here? No! She is locked up, thanks to you. But that's all right. We can sort that out. We'll find her a foster family, and can look after her until then. Is she all right? Can I see her? - She can't have anything more to do with you. - Why not? Or with this place. Do something right for once and let her go. What she needs now is a nice home and a responsible guardian, - and someone with financial and social stability. - And that's you, is it? You don't even know her! But what I know is that she needs help. "Mr. Randall, I tell you everything... Things I no tell others. You always there... hear my words." Little Sister! I've found you at last. Don't be scared. It's me. Miss Chen... What should we do with you child? How is everyone? Did the children perform well? How would I know? I wasn't there. I'm so sorry Miss Chen. I'm sorry. Little Sister, I've been thinking about what you trying to do. If you want to find your parents, we'll try when we go home. Mr. Randall is a parent to me. You mean... you want to stay here with him? It wasn't my intention. But when I met Mr. Randall I realised he's alone and needs help. I really don't know what to do. To me, the most important thing, is you have a good life, and you are happy. If you really want to stay here... I'll understand. Uh, she was brought in last night. I have authority to take her into my care. Mei Mei. I have an interim order here granting Mei Mei temporary protection status. Mei Mei, this is what you want. You can stay here in Australia. You can stay with me while we find you a foster family. I go back to China. But... No, but, Mei Mei, you can stay here. - You can start a whole new life... a nice house, good school. - No. Little Sister, are you sure? What about Mr. Randall? In my heart, he's always my father. But China is my home. And children need me more. Good. Let's go home. Thank you. Ugh! Ugh! # Happiness is just a little thing # Humans mostly are too large for it # If you cannot feel the joy of spring # Shrink yourself, and maybe then you'll fit # Happiness is just a little thing # Humans mostly are too... # When I was seven, I broke a vase. It was a secret. I didn't tell anyone but you. When I was nine, I joined the choir. The very first song that I sang... I sang it for you. Always you appear real to me. Please stay real. Please. For me. Please. Thank you. Thank you. D- don't move. You're hurt... hurt bad. You need to rest, Mr. Randall. I'm sorry, Mr. Randall, but I have something to tell you. Children need me... ...and I miss them. So you... You won't be here? Yes. I will. In letters. And you will be with me, like before... But different. Different. Real, huh? I have a name for you. May. Mei? That... that already my name. May... May's spring in China. And autumn... ...here it's autumn. So... So you can be "May" in both places. It's a real name. It's a big girl's name. But, you know, in China, only parents can give name to child. May. How are you feeling? - Yeah, I'm all right. - Where are you going? To speak to the deputy director. - Oh, you don't need to speak to the deputy director. - Yes, I do. - We had a deal, and he didn't live up to it. - You didn't let me finish. I've made all the arrangements. They realize that they can't fight any lawsuit you'd bring, so you're free to go. And joining the Sydney children's choir today is the Dong Ying Choir. Put your hands together and give them a warm welcome. This is the final performance of their Australian tour. It's all ready. Your turn has come. I... I can't. It's your favourite song. Go on. You can do it. Go. # It's because I love you, not because we're far apart # It's because I love you and because you're near my heart # Ooh oo-oo-ooh oo-ooh # Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be, yeah # Do what you wanna do # Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be, yeah # Do what you wanna do # Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be, yeah # "Dear Mr. Randall... two new little Mei Meis come stay in orphanage last week. I teach them sing. Their voices are small, but will be stronger next year for when you come to see us. Love, May. # Ooooooooooh # Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be, yeah # Do what you wanna do # Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be, yeah #
