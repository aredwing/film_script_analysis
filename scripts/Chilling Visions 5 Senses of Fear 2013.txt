If I'd known then what I know now... I never would have let that bitch in my house. Yeah, okay! Okay. Hello, how can I help you? Good morning, Mr. Kyle. Did I wake you? Yeah, uh, how do you know my name? It's 8:30, you're supposed to be at work at 9:00, aren't you? Yeah, I'm... I'm sick, so... Sick or sick of trying? What are you doing here? What is all this trash? I can see you have no wife. Ex-wife, thanks for bringing it up. No girlfriend, no pets? I have a plant. You need a woman in your life, Mr. Kyle, not a sad little sprout! Okay. Wait, wait, wait, hold it. What are you doing here? Why are you in my house? I'm here to change your life, Mr. Kyle. It's not your fault you're unlucky in love. - It's your pheromones. - My pheromones? Success has a certain scent. And so does failure. Your pheromones lack the ability to attract. You smell... undesirable. You want me to change my soap? I do wish you would take this more seriously, Mr. Kyle. I'm on a tight schedule. This will do for you what your pheromones will never be able to. Cologne. You want to sell me cologne. Consider it a free sample. Trust me. It's a scent to die for. Ah, ah, ah! Not around others. It's a very powerful tool. I suggest you use it sparingly at first to see how you react. If you notice anything out of the ordinary, stop using it immediately and call me. What do you mean, "out of the ordinary?" Huh? Oh, that's just something we're supposed to say. Good day, Mr. Kyle! Wait, that's it? You have my card. All right. Gutenberg, man. I've been saying for weeks, right, hmm, haven't I? Hmm, tell me, I've been saying it for weeks. Cutbacks. We're next, man. I'm telling you, the Gute got the boot! The Gute got the boot, but were just further down the alphabet. Okay, today it's Gutenberg. Tomorrow it's Masters... and whatever your last name is. You don't even know my last name? I'm bad with names, you know. You know Gutenberg's last name. Gute's been here forever. Hey, Gute! Gute! I trained Gutenberg. There's a wall between us, Seth. Not just a physical one. Okay? Gotta let somebody in. Wanna hug? Hey. Seth. What... Hi, what... what are you doing here? I know I shouldn't bother you here. Or ever, but, uh... Here. Seth, I... I don't know what to say. They're beautiful. I've been goin' crazy thinking about you. Thinking about us and everything that happened. And I wish... I wish I could fix things. I just miss you. I miss you too. I know we said we wouldn't... do this, but... I've... I gotta see you. What are you... What are you doing Friday? Wanna get a drink, something to eat? I don't care. Something. Please? - Okay. - Okay. Um, let's... let's do, uh... Michael's. Eight PM. My favorite. I know. Okay, um, I'll leave now. But, uh... see you Friday. Eight PM. Michael's. - Hey, where you been, man? - Lunch. I already told you. Look, two... Two more got canned while you were gone... Harmon and Johnson. They were asking for Kyle, but you were already gone so they skipped to Lewis. Dude, I walked past there earlier, heard him crying. Lewis doesn't cry. He's not a crier. Yeah, I heard what I heard. Mr. Kyle, I see you're back from lunch. Would you mind stepping in here, please? Uh, uh, yes. Just give me... give me... give me two minutes. I'll be... restroom. Gotta use the restroom. Shoot. Seth. We just wanted to... to take a moment and... Well... We no longer feel that... that you're right for your position. But... I mean... After sitting with you for a moment, I think it's clear. You're not being utilized properly at all. Absolutely not. It's obvious. Seth has been unable to succeed because we have failed him as leaders. Seth, you know, you just possess a natural charisma and confidence that just says manager to me. Absolutely, I just can't believe we didn't see this sooner. I mean, where have you been hiding, Seth Kyle? I... I... I've been right there. The whole time. How long you been with us? - I... I've been here for eight years. - Eight years? How come I didn't know that? I think he's due for this manager's job. Absolutely. What? It's time to take a break and close my eyes and really see # It's time to wander far away and be and really be. # I got a ticket to happiness # And you know I'm gonna stay # I got a ticket to happiness # Let the trip take me away. # Seth passing the office... oh, boom, boom! Bah! Yeah, sugar in the house. Woo! Yo, hit me, whoa! Grenade. Yo... Boom! Boom! You got a ticket to happiness# You know you're gonna stay# Get a ticket to happiness# Let the trip take you away.# Ohh. No! No! Hello. Hello? This message is for Miss Margaret. - This is Seth... - Seth Kyle. I'm having serious problems with your product. So... I need you to call me back, please. Call me back! Please call me back. Hi, love. Hey, pretty lady, you all right? It's me. It's me, what... What? What! What is it? It's me, Seth Kyle! Remember? Do you remember me? Eight years. Eight years... I spent at this desk! On this keyboard! Just typing! W, w, w, w, dot, dot, dot... And for what? For what? Seth, come on, man. Oh, Spencer! Oh, Spencer, my best friend. He doesn't even know my last name. Why not? Call security. Seth, you're sick. I think you need to go home. And I think you should shut up! 'Cause gentlemen, I just wanna thank you for this glorious promotion. I can't say enough awful things about this Godforsaken hellhole! - Who you calling, sweetheart? - Oh, Seth! Oh, Seth... Seth, please, oh! Oh boy. [Gasping and coughing Hello? Sarah? - Sarah. - Seth? Seth, w... Where are you? Sarah, I'm sorry. What are you... what are you talking about? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Seth... I'm sorry I missed our date. Seth, are you okay? I loved you. I love you. Seth, where are you? I love you. Seth, tell me where you are. Hello, Seth? Hello! Um... yeah... I'm sorry, I can't... Can you tell me what hotel this is? Hello? Seth? Hello. 9- 1-1, please hold. It's interesting to think about what happens after we die. I don't mean spiritually. I mean the remains of our physical selves. I've met a lot of people who say they want to be cremated. It always seemed like such a waste to me. I've always like the idea that I'll just fade into the Earth, feeding the worms and the grass. In some small way, my body will perpetuate the circle of life. Even if I never accomplish anything in life, it's nice to think I'll be significant in death. Which is better... number one... or... number two? Number two. Ahh, okay. Just one little adjustment here. Okay. And... Ahh. Ahh. Here we are. Very good job. Dr. Tom, Amy Kellerher's here for her 11:30. Amy. Dr. Tom... hello? - Hello. - Yeah. Yes, sorry, uh, send her to exam room three. Okay, let's see what we can see, shall we? Oh, my. Little bump on your cheek there. Mind if I ask what happened? Just clumsy. Aren't we all. But you know, with eyes like yours you need to be extra careful with injuries like that. Your glaucoma isn't getting any worse, but your keratoconjunctivitis is aggravated. Well, I have my mother's bad eyes. Oh, I think your eyes are fine, just fine. Besides, if you didn't have a few ocular issues, I wouldn't get to see you so much. So, when am I gonna meet this new boyfriend of yours? Uh, Tucker, isn't it? Uh, Travis. Ah, Travis, right. He's still having trouble with, uh, reading close up? Yeah, you know, but he won't admit it. He's got this germ thing. And he thinks he's gonna catch something from the eye machine. You know, Amy... I think I better check that farsightedness again. Leave a message. Hi there, Amy. Listen, I was just thinking about Travis' vision problem and I completely forgot to mention that we have a first visit special going right now. Guess what? It's free. Yep, free. So, just call up and we'll make an appointment for him. I think the patient lacks insight. If only he could see the error of his ways. Hmm, several doses of medicine very like his own should do the trick. Well, you got a little early onset myopia. Means the, uh, nearsightedness we all get with age is coming on a little early with you. No worries, we'll get you fixed up with some bifocals. Bifocals? Relax, you only have to wear them when you want to. Now let's get you checked for glaucoma. Over here. Now, this is the one that blows in the eye. Don't worry. Big, tough guy like you can surely handle it. Now, there's gonna be a little puff. But first, tell me, though, Travis, do you love her? What? What the hell business is it of your... Travis? Travis. Travis! Please, stop! I'll be good, I'll... I'll be a good boy, I promise! You're a dirty piece of crap! You won't hurt me again! Never, never again! What the hell is happening? What's happening? If he's gonna be with you, he shouldn't hurt you like that. He just needed to be scared straight. But enough of him. This is our time. What the hell did you do to me? I said, what the hell did you do to me? Nope, no. "Amy Kellerher... Reflections and mirrors." - I can explain. - No, no, never mind. I don't know how exactly, but... I think I got a pretty good idea what you done to me. No, don't... Wh... what's that for? Well, it ain't goin' in your ass cheeks, that's for sure. Please, please don't, I'm sorry. - I... I shouldn't have... - Shouldn't have what? Messed with other people's business? Peeping Tommed where you don't belong? I only wanted to see... really see. - See what? - Everything. You wanna know what I see, Doc? Blood. I know it's not really there anymore, but... I still see her blood. You were supposed to stop. You... you... you were supposed to understand. You think heapin' a pile of murderous images and abuse on my brain was gonna make me think, "Oh, God... Oh, God, what a bad man I am. I repent." You know, you may be an okay eye doctor and you're sure as hell some kind of mad scientist freak. But you're a crap psychologist, Doc. You don't know a thing about me... my life, what I've seen. Look, I know I may not be the nicest guy I know. - But guess what? - What? At least I'm out there trying to live a real life. While you sit here alone in the dark mentally masturbating to the memories of others. You thought this would help me. You turbocharged me. Who knows, maybe if you had loaded my head full of images of cute, cuddly kittens, I would have straightened out right as rain, you know? But you messed up. You killed her, Doc. Oh, no, I didn't mean for this to happen. Shh, don't cry, Doc... not... not yet, at least. Oh. Come on, seriously? God, no... no, please no... - No, no, no, no! - Hold still, damn it. God, God make it stop! Make it stop! I get it now, I see now. Make it stop, make it stop. It stopped. - It stopped. - See now? That wasn't so bad, huh? Who's there? Is someone there? I need help. No, no, no! No, no... No! No, it goes like this... - # Da-da-da-da da-da-da# - Are you sure? Yeah, Henry and I used to sing it on the radio. Right? Mm-hm. How many miles, Henry? Thirty-eight. I don't know how he does it. It's unreal. Mom? Mom? Wh... what happened? Henry? D... D... Dad? Wh... what's wrong? Wh... what happened to the car? Wait for police. The phone is broken. We gotta get your mother outta here. Can you help me? Okay. Lift up... okay. Dad? - Dad. - You know where the car is, right? East. Good. Wave for help. Mom. Gotta go find help. Henry, no. There's a creek. It's not far from here. I'll find you. No, stay here. Stay... stay here. Help! Can anyone hear me? Clearing, log, east, path, sign, southeast, road, car, sm... Trap. Help, please, please help. Hello? Please help me. Help. Help. Help me. Hello? Help. Hello? I didn't mean to just walk in, but... I... I was in an accident. I... I need help. My family... Our car ran off the road. I'm blind, but I can... I can show you where it is. He left to find the accident. He's hunting, using traps. Doesn't like to be touched. Nine fingers. Trap. - Ooh. - Whoa there. Please, I need help. Do you have a phone? Are you all right. Our car ran off the road. I'm blind, but I can take you there. Can... can you call the police? Don't worry. Where are your parents? They were in the accident too. They're hurt. What's your name? Henry. There are other people that need help too. - Just... - No one lives up there, Henry. It's abandoned. But there's a house. It... it has people in it. - I... I don't know how many. - Okay, okay. Take me to your parents. What's wrong? I ha... have to pick up my cane. You need to be careful out here, Henry. There's a lot of things to trip on if you're not careful. What about your parents? How long are you going to hide, Henry? Hello! I know I heard somethin' out there. Are you out there, kid? I found your parents up the road. Hello! I saw your house, you sick bastard. I already called the cops. I know you can't see. But I have a gun. Four. Three. What are you counting? You don't like germs, do you? Two. You don't like to touch things. I don't need to. Maybe you should. Maybe it'll help you keep track of things. One. Mister? Are you okay? Your ten o'clock should be here shortly. This is it? This is it. How much do I owe you? No payment necessary. It's all been taken care of. Is this where we are? They'll tell you everything inside. Hello? Hello. Hello. Is there a call button or somethin'? Hey, hello! Hi, um, I'm Aaron. Ah, yes, we've been expecting you. Uh-huh. You'll be meeting with Lacey today. I'll let her know you've arrived. Can you tell me what I'm doin' here? I'm sorry, that's not my job. What is your job? To make sure that you see Lacey. And what's her job? To evaluate you to make sure that you can do your job. And what is my job? She'll tell you that. Now, please, have a seat over there and fill out these forms. Excuse me. Hey... have either of you guys been in to see Lacey yet? Of course not. I already know what I'm doing, though. They've got me teaching seventh grade. What about you? Law. I guess someone's gotta keep things nice and tight for them, huh? Have I seen you before? I don't think so. Mm, it's your first time here? Is it obvious? I, um... remember my first time. I was nervous too. Right off the bat I was a cable guy. Yeah, I didn't think much of it at the time, but... yeah, you'd be surprised at how much you can influence people when you're controlling what they watch. Right. Can you tell me what I'm doing here? They haven't told you yet? So far, all I've gotten is a free limo ride here and "it's not my job." Well, it's certainly not mine either. Right. This is your job? That's right, bub. This... and that. And that. Anything else they need. They? They're hungry for guys like you. Young, fresh. You know, if they haven't told you what it is yet, it's probably a big one. Even if it isn't, you take it. Lacey's a shark. Trust me. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. I gotta get back on duty. Oh, and don't worry about fillin' those out. Seems like they've got their sights on you. Well, you take care, bub. You too. Aaron Whit worth. Miss Sharp should be with you shortly. Please, make yourself at home. Where the hell are you and how the hell did you get here? Already hard at work, I see. I'm sorry. No, you're not. You were doing exactly what you wanted. Impressive. They were right about you. I'm sorry, but who are you again? I'm Lacey, Lacey Sharp. And it's your job to tell me what I'm doing here? Mmm, my job is to find people. And I've had my eye on you for quite some time. - Really? Really. I need someone, such as yourself to... do a job for me. Hmm, which of my many talents are you referring to? Hmm. We have a project. It requires someone who can take charge. Someone with the balls to get the job done. What kind of project? I don't even know what you guys do here. Wherever I am. - Watershed. - I'm sorry. Watershed. Where you are... and uh... we do things that need to be done, wherever they need to be done. In every city, every state, every country. What makes you think I'm the man for the job? Mmm, your rsum says you're more than qualified. My rsum? Mm. Aaron Whit worth, born September 26, 1985. By the time you were 16 you had breached every secure network within 200 miles of your home. I get it. I have an eye for talent. And when I find it, I pounce. This offer is non-negotiable. Should you refuse, you will be considered a direct competition and, well... we don't have any competition. How do you manage that? Because we don't allow there to be any. On this project, you will be working with two teams to find the origins of a treatment. What kind of treatment? A song... split amongst several devices. It must be recovered and restored. - I need you... - What's in it for me? A full-time position. I'll take care of you. Keep you busy. Long hours. That's nice and all, but you see... I like my freedom. Not really a tied down kinda guy. Oh, I think you'd like being tied down here. I work by myself. I don't know what it is you guys do here, but I'm not interested. Thanks for the offer. But at the same time, no thanks. This... place... really isn't my taste. So, I guess that means you're refusing my offer? No, I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'll take the job. I'm sorry! I'll take the job. No, no. No! Wait. Pl... please help. Please help me, pl... Why doesn't anyone help me? Please help. Why doesn't anyone help me? Ma'am, Grace Englehart is on her way. She'll be here shortly. This is a warning. This is a warning. So, you're making a movie about a song that kills you? Um... well, yeah. But it's based on a real life story about an actual song. It's Russian. What would happen then, I mean, how do you die? Does your face melt? Do you go crazy? Are you filming this? Isn't that what we want her to do? No, that's what the network wants her to do. Can I make a fake office person too? I'm... I'm sorry, fake office people? The... the office people, your, um, the pirate cook. - Um, you know she's... Not a pirate, she had a cooking accident. So, just be a little sensitive because she can hear everything you're saying. ...actual... I mean, not proofs, but... Supposedly there's a performance of it. They got... The performance took place in the 1970s supposedly, depending on the conflicting primary sources. Do you think it's worth trying to find the real one? Listen, My Children in Russian. Whoa. Can't believe we just stole this. Anyway, don't just... We didn't actually steal it, it was actually, uh, given to us by a really, really nice older man. Let's cut this. Check out this honker. Oh, my. And we are ready. You look a little... Are you scared? Ready? Hit play. Out of order. Was that downstairs? We wanna go non-fiction on this. Uh, yeah, we got more tapes. Uh, and someone we... Well, someone, we think from the institute, who's cool and maybe on our side is like, feeding us more material. So, I mean, I don't know if it's a hoax, but I feel like we should pursue it and maybe treat it more like it's non-fiction. Are you good? Think so. What we think we found is some kind of test. Uh, and if it's real, and holy, I think it is, uh, that's awesome. The tapes don't really make any linear sense right now. But, uh, I think if we put it together... Yeah, we're just gonna try to cut it together into a, you know, full thing and see what we got, dude... we got dude... Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba... Mmm-mmm-mmm... Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba... - This is D-3-9-3-2-G-A-I-3-9. - That's my. Now, this... we're running on the record of these events. If you duplicate or divulge to any other party without the consent... Seventy percent of all fibers that wire the brain to the ear are outgoing. We cannot hear what we think we hear. All sound is subject to neurological processing. In our recent aural experiments, we have found a number of compound frequencies that turn this processor against itself, leading to distraction, nausea, and synthetic constri... Although the circuit erroneously translated as The Listening Child, the title of the song is in fact Listen, My Child... Listen my... Listen... Mikkola Losif, who for the first 30 years of his life, com... nearly 200 songs before being committed to an asylum, where he composed only one song. This song. Within one unifying note, it's almost paradoxical conversions of consonance and dissonance. Phase one is finding a pianist capable of playing this music. No easy... No easy task. You'll find the music on the piano. Once more please, clearer. Vick Handley. Just whenever? Please. Thank you, Mr. Handley. There's a small stipend and a few papers for you to sign on your way out. With repetition, he'll be ready... be ready. Guys. I don't know. You all right? Who is this? Guys, it's... it's Grace. I'm sorry, I'm sick. I'm really, really sick. Like, I'm turning the phone off and I'm... I'm turning off everything in the house that makes noise. Say... all right, just tell us your name. Uh, I'm Dan. I'm gonna be doing sound for this project eventually. And, uh, I'm here tonight because, um... He's worried about us. I'm a little worried about these guys. Dan, thank you for coming and being the... the eyes. So, we might die tonight. But it's gonna be worth it 'cause it's... this is art. What do you want to do? Let's go for it. This is crazy. This is crazy. It's not crazy, it's like a source. Like... like journalists... you know, they have sources. - Just keep lookin'. - See anything? Go around the corner. Oh,. Come here. This has gotta be for us. Just so weird. Oh, my God. Nothing? I just searched all the way up there and there's nobody in there. Okay, well, if they left these out in the open, then they wouldn't have gone far. Take it right now. Well, just look around because they might... Just run. Stan, there is nine bars from completion. Seems unable to continue. Notes must remain unbroken. It's my responsibility to determine your... Run out of time! I can't keep you. Don't take... That's all that makes linear sense. Uh, the rest is, uh, broken up into, uh, three frame fragments. Oh, my God. They can't stand it when it's real. So, I think I can just... transfer those over to... - to make it into a group of stills - Cool. - And then a group of slides... - Awesome, great. Hey, the clips or the frames are... Like a piano is a sequence and a... a... - You take it from a... - I'm... I'm sorry, I don't get it. - And then. - Okay. It's fine, it's fine. Yeah, it's timecode. Uh, probably listed in the order of the fragments coming. You guys really didn't see this? Go, go, go, go, go. Guys, I think someone's giving you the option. I... I mean... do you want to see this? I mean... I mean, really. - Do you want to see thi... - Get your foot off, toad! Guys, what's the problem, why haven't you sent this? Look, you know... I'm sorry, we... we have to make cuts out of the soundtrack. We're getting really behind here. Have you finished editing? Well, not really, no. We had to... we had to edit with the sound off. And then we had to watch something else next to it like... like movies we loved as little kids. Make the audio cuts, it'll be scarier. Then both of you sit down and watch the whole thing front to back. We probably should be stopping we probably should be... # Are you singing? Go ahead, we're watching. ...Mr. Handley's consent we have found a solution that will allow him to play the entire song uninterrupted. He comes in and he finds a... a blood bath. And then he can't bear to destroy it. So... so... so... he codes... Or else someone else comes in and then they watch it and they can't understand because... They... they wanted us to code it and we did we did just what they. I said I can't do it anymore! We have to destroy it! Right now. This is Grace's camera. It's on? What's that sound? - He's still playing it. - Go. Go. She uploaded it. It's... oh, my God... it's already got 18 views. - Check the... - Now, 19. Check the audio time frame, see which version it is. Oh, okay, uh... It's um... it's... uncut. - Oh, the audio to... - No, no, no, no. Trying to move my hand and the other hand's moving. Just take your hand down and we can... we can start. - We have to start. - All right, hold on. There's t... do you wanna st... do you wanna... Who wants to start it off? Um, I do. Uh, ooh, I'm sorry, what were we... This is... this is a warning. This is a warning. A warning for everybody out there... - Please... - Important that it be seen. Pass this along to your friends and your family and everyone you want to be safe. You sent it everywhere? There's a link still out there. We did what we could, we tried, I'm really sorry. If you get an email with the subject line, "Listen, My Children" Don't open, don't click on it. If you see a picture of this guy, don't watch it. If this is the opening line of this piece of music... ...this music, if you hear the music, yeah, if you hear it... If you hearth beginning of the song, just, just... Please... Don't listen.
