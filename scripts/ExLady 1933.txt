If you say, "politely"... - I'll get my things. - Alright. My dear, you better wake your husband. He seems a little "hors de combat. " Wake up, darling. Oh... good evening, all. Must we really go? Hate to drive you away, but I've got lots of work to do tomorrow. Tomorrow's Sunday. That's the only way I know it's Sunday: I do twice as much work as other days. - What are you working on now, Helen? Illustrating that What's-His-Name's book for children. I finished that. I'm doing a cover now for the Home Journal. - Ladies'? - Ladies'. - Let's go. - I laugh every time I think of it... - Goodnight, Helen. -The subject of the lecture was La Vivandi're... Well, to make a long story short, after the lecture was over... ...Aunt Lucinda went up to the lecturer and told him how much she enjoyed it. Good night Helen. Come over and see us soon. Pick any night you want. - Well, the old gentleman decided... - Soon as I get breathing time I'll call. Well? Are you going, or coming? I'd like to stay a while, - Nick, I've got to get to bed. -So what? You know I'm not that kind of a girl. - I know you're nice. -And is that being nice? Go on home. You know, something's got to be done about you and me sooner or later. Goodnight, Nick! - Is that you? -Who else do you expect? Gosh, it was a long evening. Darling, we need such evenings. It makes things you love not go stale on you. And what things do you love? My work. Is that all? Yes. Yes? Yes. Oh, come on. Help me clean up. - Must you really work tomorrow? -No way out. I promised the cover for Monday. Ah, confound the cover! Yes. But don't confound the 300 dollars. You're a successful woman. I ought not to like it. You're a pretty successful man. I ought not to like it. [In unison:] "I'm a man. " What a boring evening. Oh. Boring? Its always boring when we're not alone. Say: I'm hungry. You want to turn in right away? No. Only said that. I'm hungry too. Let's see what we've got. You know... I'm just about fed up with sneaking in. - Sneaking? - Yes, sneaking. Let's get married. So I'll have the right to be with you. What do you mean, "right"? I don't like the word "right. " Oh, let's not quibble about words. No, I'm not quibbling. "Right" means something. No one has any rights about me, except me. How about a Welsh rarebit? - You know my weakness. - No. Tell me. Rarebits. Hello, Father. What brings you here? Excuse me a minute. I'm cold. I want to put something on. Wait outside. It's better you should not listen to this. Where's Mother? No use shutting the door. I saw him. Cheap. Cheap! My daughter, cheap! I'm not cheap. I just don't want to make an unholy drama out of this. There's no drama. I had heard, but I didn't believe. Now I see it. My daughter. My child. Oh, don't let's get dramatic about this. Don't let's start arguing. We've been all over this. I don't believe in what you believe. That's all. I don't want to get married. - I don't want to get married. - You don't want? YOU don't want? The whole world is wrong! You are right! We've been all over this 100 times. If you came in here to start a scene or make an argument, I wish you'd go. - Alright, I'll go. But first... -What are you doing? I'll show you what I am doing! Don, I'm sorry. That's alright. I want to talk to this lump alone. - Come on out, Don. -Let me talk to him. I want to talk to him. - Alone! -Yes, alone. Do you mind, Helen? You dirty, low... Can't you skip all that? I want to talk this over with you, reasonably. Reasonably! Reasonably! Better I shouldn't talk to you at all. Better I should do what a father ought to do: I should kill you! I bring up a child to be a good girl, to hope someday she will meet a good man. She should be married. She should have children. When comes along a scoundrel, a dirty, low scamp! There's no use talking like that, Mr. Bauer. Helen and I don't feel the way you do about it. We're in love with each other, and we don't want to get married. You're hopelessly old-fashioned, Mr. Bauer. Old-fashioned! That's a good word. That's a compliment. Why, thank you! What's good is old-fashioned? - You dirty, low... -This isn't going to get us anywhere. - Come. -Adolph, maybe... -Come! Let's have breakfast. I'm starved. Let's talk. - Let's eat. -No, let's talk. Let's eat and talk. Helen, I'm willing to kid about this, but we can't go on kidding about it. - We ought to get married. - "Ought... " Ouch! Yes, ought. We ought to get married. There isn't a reason in the world why we don't. And you call my father old-fashioned! It isn't that I'm stuffy, Helen. I've been around. Just a playboy. Now, you know what I mean. The funny part of it is, when we first met, when, we, uh...  Dash, dash, asterisk...  I didn't feel this way about it at all. I think if you had suggested marriage... ...at the time, I'd have run rapidly in the other direction. Now, I know you're going to say this is sentimental, Helen. But I like to feel we belong to each other forever and ever. I want to marry you. Aww, Don, we've been over it. Over it and over it. I went away from home to be on my own. I don't want to be like my mother, a yes-woman for some man. I want to be a person on my own. If I like to live a certain way, and have a certain kind of furniture... ...do a certain kind of work, and wear a certain kind of clothes... I want to do it. And not have somebody tell me I ought to do something else. No one is going to tell you. Oh, yes you are. If you're married. That's what being married means. You must do what the other person wants. You must please them. Marriage means... oh, I've said it 50 times, Don. It's dull. I'm not going to say it again. Toast? - Helen, I feel strongly about this. -Stop it. It's either marriage, or... It's dull! Where are you going? It's dull! You're just as stubborn as your father. Just as stubborn. We have a different sense of values. I don't want babies. When I'm 40, I'll think of babies. In the meantime, there are 20 years in which I want to be the baby... ...and play with my toys, and have a good time playing with them. A career. Oh, it isn't just that. Sure, I want to do good work. But it isn't that. I want to stay young for a while & have a good time. And not be dull and set. I don't want to be a wife. And I do want to be a husband. Wants to be a husband! I don't see anything funny about that. I want to marry you, and that's all there is to it. Alright, that's all there is to it. Alright, that's all there is to it. Oh, don't be a fool. Be a fool! - Hello, Helen. - Hello! Oh, you don't want to see me. Well, this is strictly business. Somebody told me you're a good artist. Alright. Business is business. I'm going over to Nick's place. Suppose you drop in there? Why Nick's place? He's having an exhibit of his work. All the big who's-its are going to be there. - Alright. - See you there. What lines! What life! Yes, it's beautiful. So round, and soft. - This line. -Come, darling, let's move along. Oh, let's look at this one. It's called "Josephine. " Don't you love it, ducky? [Conversation in Italian. ] - Haven't we met somewhere before? -Oh, have we? - Now your name is, uhh... -Iris. - Iris! Of course, Iris. And we met in, uhh... -Venice? - Venice, yes. Oh. In a gondola. -In a gondola? [Italian: "I recall that beautiful night in Venice. "] Oh, that delicious night! The moon on the water. And the gondolier singing... [Italian. ] Yes. - It's no use. - What? I never was in Venice. But I want to make my husband jealous. That's my husband. I just can't make him jealous. Oh, if I only could! Sorry. These are all sold. This one I got $200 for. For this sweet baby I got 6. That's tops so far. Although "Josephine" should bring a whole lot more than that. In fact, I've already had a bid of $1500. Who's Josephine? The lovely lady without raiment. Or benefit of clergy. And that brings up the old subject. Let's drop the old subject. You're quite a Puritan, aren't you? - Think so? -What else can I think? - Otherwise, you'd... -Otherwise, I'd say yes to the irresistible Mr. Melvin. Mm-hmm. And thanks for the adjective. What conceit. Is that nice? Helen, I keep asking you: why not? - Don't be so persistent, Nick. It's annoying. -Generally successful... Helen, is it possible that you misunderstand? I won't marry you. - Is that a promise? - Absolutely. Haha. Come on. Let's quit kidding. - That's what he said. -Who said? That's what every man says when he wants you to do what he wants you to. Man. Whoo! I'm souring on the lot of you. You know, you're awfully sweet. Aw, come on, Helen. Why not? The real reason. Because I love another. I heard something today...! Hello, Don. Hello. - May I see you, Helen? - In just a minute. The Ellison Agency is after the Palm Mennen account. They want someone to do the drawings. I mentioned you. Thanks, Nick. If Ellison gets the account, they'll pay you plenty. - Is it on spec? -Not a bit of speculation in it. The account is in the bag. All you have to do is make the drawings. Will you excuse me? I have to try and sell some more pictures. Well, Don? - That's what I was going to talk to you about. -What? Well, I think now we'd best forget about it. No, tell me. Oh, I had the hunch to go after the Palm Mennen account. And I was going to ask you to do the drawings. Oh. But I don't stand a chance against Ellison. They're big. Except that I thought, with your drawings... but that's out. With Ellison it's a cinch for you. With me you'd be gambling. And I ought to do them for you? "Ought" is a bad word. I was all wrong yesterday, Helen. You were right. The fact that we love each other shouldn't put us under obligations. Don, you make me feel a little ashamed. Must and ought are out. Even "marriage. " There aren't any arguments for marriage. The only one I have... the only one I ever really had... I love you so much. Let's look at some more pictures. Have dinner with me. Yes. I'm full of Tony's good red wine. And you. Make a song out of that. It was a swell evening. Don... I'm going to do the drawings for you. Oh, no. Nothing doing. There you go. I want to! Mmm. I'd better go home, hadn't I? Do you want to? No. I don't want to. Don, will you marry me? Well! Goodnight. Goodnight. Mr. Peterson wants you quick, if you could. Alright, girls. Relax. - They're on the phone, asking me to hold it. -Who? Palm Mennen. Oh. You know what that means, don't you, honey? It means we get it! - Well, you can't be sure. -What would they be calling up here for? You know what we'll do, honey? We'll have that honeymoon we didn't have. Havana! We'll go to Havana. Shh! Yes? What? Who? Yes, I know that. Well, I can't do that. What I want to know is, who's handling the account? Oh. What's happened? They, uh... They want me to give them the name and telephone number of the... ...artist who did the drawings. Don! Ellison has the account. They, um... They just want your drawings. Well, they won't get them. Not without you. Yeah, but I'm out, Helen. I'm out. Then I'm out. No, don't do that. Be sensible about it. You might as well save what you can out of it. Well, it makes me mad. You can handle it every bit as well as Ellison. Just because somebody's big. Whatever that means. Aw, darling. Don. Let's go somewhere. Let's get all dolled up and go somewhere. - What's the matter with you? -I feel young and giddy and gay. Ha! At my age. I'm going to bed. - You poor darling. - Cut that. Let's go. Where? Havana. Are you crazy? We've lost the Palm Mennen account, we haven't gotten it. That's just why. We're sunk with worrying about it. Let's go somewhere, and not tell anybody where, and have a real honeymoon. And then come back and get to work. And that'll be fun. The way it is now, nothing's fun. - And what'll we use for money? - Oh, it isn't as bad as all that. And the business? Who's going to run that? Nothing very terrible can happen in 10 days. It'll go on. Aw, Don. Please, let's go. We're both fed up. I'd like to go... We'll go. But I haven't a thing to wear. Silencio! Atencion, caballeros... [More Spanish. ] - What do you call this game again? - Jai alai. It's like handball. Jai alai... [More Spanish. ] Hey! See that the lady wins. - Hello, Joe. -Hello, Mr. Peterson ... and missus. -Hello, mister. How is everything? Landed any new accounts for me? Say, what's the matter around here? Something's wrong. Oh, everything's alright, Mr. Peterson. Oh, why not break it to him? I say when it's serious, operate. - What do you mean? Well, we lost the Fletcher Bathroom Equipment account. Maybe only temporarily. Well, what went wrong? All the copy was laid out and ready. Well, you see, Mr. Peterson, it was like this: Mr. Fletcher, Mr. Simon Fletcher, the president, didn't like the copy. And he wanted you to change it? And you weren't here to change it. He knows he wasn't here. - So he came in the office and made a big fuss about it. -Let's get inside. - Get me Mr. Fletcher on the phone. Hurry! -Yes, sir. - Other things have happened too. -What? We thought the Dorothy Gray conference wasn't coming up until after the 1st. - Yes? -But they had a meeting and wanted to do something right away on... - ... that special campaign for that new perfume. -Yes, but what happened? I tried to give them some ideas, but they wouldn't listen to me. And so... ...well, they gave it to someone else. Well, that's that. But I don't think we lost the account, Mr. Peterson. Just on that one campaign. - "Just on that one campaign. " -Yeah. I counted on that. I needed it. It's my fault. I shouldn't have gone. I might have foreseen this would happen. A stitch in time usually... - Why don't they get Fletcher? What's the matter? -Yes, sir. - Oh, Don. Please don't worry about it. -Hmmph. We didn't miss any bills... Hello. Fletcher Company? Get me Mr. Simon Fletcher, please. This is Mr. Peterson talking. Hello, Mr. Fletc... Oh. Mr. Fletcher is out. To me. That's $8000 a year we lose. We took a trip. Now if we lose Dorothy Gray, we can close up shop. Oh, Don, I'm sorry. We had to take a trip. Don, please. I wanted us to have a honeymoon. Mm-hmm. You wanted us to have a honeymoon. Don, please! All that is gone now. Take the Romanticists. Look what they did. For the harmony and the purity of the classics... ...they substituted the capricious standards of the Middle Ages. Fantastic? Picturesque? Imaginative? Yes! But sentimental. That other thing which had precision, truth, unadorned beauty... That's all gone now. - My boilers can stand more strain than... -Indeed? Oh, yes, my, yes. They've been subjected to 50 years of wear & tear, and have stood every test. - Every test? -Every test. My boilers... His boilers... - How are your boilers, Mr. Peterson? - I'm doing fine. Thank you. Oh, let me forget. What were you saying? Something else about my boilers: They're made of a very secret alloy. Did you know that? - No. -Of course not. Few people know anything about boilers. There's something else you'd never guess: My boilers are the best boilers manufactured in the world. Van Hugh inherited this place. I inherited the boilers, from my grandfather. - It's been a grave responsibility. - Of course. Entertainment is needed. Madame Godzinskaya, would you favor us with a number? Delighted. I forgot the words! - There's another thing about my boilers... -Good heavens! I beg your pardon? The song was so touching. Swell evening, wasn't it? What's the matter? Boilers. What? Boilers, boilers, boilers. I've heard so much about them, I hope they all bust. He's a dull fellow, isn't he? Pity a girl like Peggy has to be married to a man like that. Great pity. It's alright though for your wife to sit listening all evening to the big bore.. ...as long as you can make it a thrilling evening for poor, poor Peggy. Aw, listen, you're not jealous, are you? It isn't jealousy. If you don't understand why... Marriage! What do you mean, "marriage"? What's that got to do with it? Well, if you're in love with a boy, and he's supposed to be in love with you... ...you don't sit stuck away in a corner all evening... ...while he makes love to another woman. Not twice you don't! Not if you aren't married! Aww, you're exaggerating. I don't like it, Don. I don't like it at all. Now, Helen, I don't want any scenes. I'm tired and I want to go to sleep. Boilers! - Now, Ms. Seymour, please. Let's jump into this. -It's 6:00, Mr. Peterson. Ms. Seymour, we've too much to do to worry about the time. I can't work anymore! I don't feel well. I'm sure I have a high temperature. I'm sorry to hear that. You better go home. Yes... I've got to go home. - Get here early in the morning. - I hope I can, Mr. Peterson. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Coming out to dinner, Don? - No. I have work to do. Well, I'll run along. - Why? What's your hurry? -I have work to do. Here are the drawings for Garfinkel. What is it that's so important that you go home every night to work on it? Don... I'm doing the drawings for Ellison. - What drawings? - The Palm Mennen drawings. Wasn't any point in my not doing them. Ellison had the account. - Thought I might at least... - You don't owe me any explanation. I know I don't. I'm just decent enough to offer one. You might have told me sooner. - What's the difference? - It's not so sneaky. - Didn't want to hurt you. - Ha! Hurt me. Well! You'd better go along. Don't waste any time. Don, don't always tell me what to do. HELLO. Hello... Oh. Hello. What are you doing this evening? Working. Can't play hooky? No. - Well, how long are you going to be there? -All night, probably. I'm going to be in the neighborhood. Going out for dinner. If I see a light in your window, may I stop by and take you home? I guess... Yes. A light in the window... Don? - Yes? -What time is it? Just 3 o'clock. Heavens, I must have been asleep for hours. I meant to wait up for you. Just finished working? Yes. Don, why are you lying? Lying? Let's have a showdown. When I finished working, I went down to the office. I wanted to see if there wasn't something I could do. When I got there, I saw you going away with Peggy. Don, I'm fed up. - Before I even explain... - Before you even explain! You'll tell me that it was the first time, or that it was an accident. I don't care if it was the first or the 50th time. The point is, Don: it isn't any one thing. It's everything. It can't go on like this. I can't. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm tired and I don't want to argue. I'm not going to argue either. Tomorrow, I'm moving out. We're through. Are you crazy? I will be crazy, if we go on like this. It's been piling up and piling up. I said so in the beginning. Marriage isn't any good. - What's marriage to do with it? -Everything. Why did I lose out on the Palm Mennen account in the first place? Why bring that up? You've got it now, haven't you? Yes, and you resent that. And you resent the fact that we went to Havana. And when we got back, the business was in a mess on account of it. Don, you've got a right to resent it. Don't you see? It's all mixed up. You're trying to do what you think I want. And I'm trying to do what I think you want. And neither of us is doing what we want. It's no go this way, Don. Helen. You've got to compromise once in a while. Compromise is defeat. I'm not going on, Don. You're tired. And jealous. That's right, I'm jealous. And why? There's nothing wrong with your taking another girl out for an evening. If I weren't a wife, I wouldn't be jealous. And you have to come sneaking in! Alright. Listen. It's no go. What are we going to do about it? I love you, darling. And I know you love me. Let's be lovers again. Let's be separate people, and not try to be one. Listen: I'll take an apartment of my own again, and you keep this. I'll go, darling. Either way. But let's work separately and do things separately. And when we do come together again it'll always be new, and exciting, and real. Alright. We'll try that. If it'll make you happy. Goodnight. Night. Tie this for me, will you? That's another disadvantage of our arrangement: I haven't even a wife handy to tie this. Ah, these modern young people! Give me the old-fashioned girl. Do you remember the bustle? - Do you? -No. More's the pity. I remember the hobble skirt. Ah, there was an invention. The hobble skirt! They couldn't walk fast nor far in the hobble skirt. You could trust them. And now... Iris is gone. Gone? Yes, gone. To visit relatives in Assquapeck. Do you care? Do I care? Let me tell you something: I'm jealous. Insanely jealous. - Not of Iris? - Of Iris. One would never think so. That's the price I pay to be married to the most beautiful woman in the world. - Oh, I wouldn't say that. -I'll say it for you, my boy. I'll say it for you. - You mean to say you're not really indifferent to Iris? -Indifferent? I scorch. I burn. My heart... is like a volcano. But you as act as though... Ah... I act. All the world's a stage. Every man plays a part. How else am I to hold her? How else? Let's go. Do you realize, I haven't seen Helen for almost 2 weeks. If Iris knew, she'd leave me. So I am suspended between earth and sky. Doomed to love and not show it. That's life. That's love. That's women. Well, thanks very much. I'll be seeing you. You're sure you don't want me to come up with you? No, that's alright. Thanks a lot, don't bother. Goodnight! Mr. Peterson. Of all people. Ms., um... Ms., uh... Won't you come in? - May I? - Yes, do! Thank you. Charming place you have here. I like it... You too. What? Charming. It's about time, Mr. Peterson. Where are we going? My nose was shiny. Let's see. OK? Very OK. Let's not go out tonight. I want to go out. Have it your own way. No, if you don't want to go... You disarm me by agreeing with me. Don't agree with me. I want to stay. How about a compromise? Compromise is defeat. You can stay for 5 minutes after the theater, Mr. Peterson. Oh... that'll be nice. Oh, I forgot to thank you for the flower. Thank you for the flowers, Mr. Peterson. I've missed you. Let's not go out. Alright, let's... Not. Uh-huh... The ice man. I can't imagine who that can be. - Good evening. - Hello, Van. So it's you. I thought I'd go along with you. I've nothing to do. Well... we're staying. Oh, that's fine, Don. I really don't feel like going around tonight. A glass, please? Love, and life, and laughter... Love, and life, and laughter. The gods give them to us, and what do we mortals do? Ah, woe is me. Woe and alack-a-day. It was different in the old days. There were fair women and brave men. Knights, in armor, jousting. I should have liked to joust. And to have had a beauteous Iris toss me her glove... ...as I stood before her, a victor. Her tiny glove. I should have kissed her glove. My glass, please. - Mr. Van Hugh said we're to use his car. -Yes, sir. - Hey, buddy, could you spare a dime for a cup of coffee? -Coffee? I haven't had my demitasse. What do you say to the Central Park Casino? The hamburgers are lovely there. Take my arm. - Hi. - Hi. - Good morning. - Good morning. Better hurry up or you'll be late. Then you won't want to come here anymore. Try and take my key away. Swell this way, isn't it? You win. I don't win. Isn't it? Yes. I was right, wasn't I? The way a woman proves her point. - But you haven't had any breakfast. -I've got to go. When's our next date? Well... I'll call you up some time. Do that, mister. Not too soon. Tonight too soon? What's the red circle for? Red letter day. What conceit! Well... when? But that's 2 days from now. Sounds like 2 years from now. Feels like 2 years from now. Crazy. Better go to work. Bye. Bye. Wednesday? Wednesday. Not Tuesday? Wednesday. Wednesday. Hello? Oh, hello. How's tonight? Have you permission to go out with me tonight? Don't talk like that, Nick. I'll hang up. I'm on my knees, abjectly apologizing. Please, will you come out with me tonight? No, I... What time is it? Oh, is it as late as that? Well, look, um... what do you want to do? Anything you like. Alright. Call for me about 7. No, I won't be ready before 7. Better make it a quarter after. Alright... Alright. - Hello. -Oh, Don, why didn't you call 2 minutes sooner? - Why? -I just said I'd go out. - Who? - Nick. Oh. Wish I could call it off. Can't you? How can I? Well, don't. Tomorrow night? I don't know. Why? I may have some work to do. I'll call tomorrow. Well... please don't mind, darling. No. Not at all. Goodbye, dear. Bye. Funny girl. - Time to go. -What do you mean, time to go? The evening's young yet. We're going lots of places from here. No. What's the matter with you, Helen? I know: you're just a pre-war bloomer girl. - Think of something insulting. - I'm trying, hard. You know, you're hopelessly old- fashioned, but you won't admit it. I'm hopelessly sleepy. I do admit that. That's old-fashioned. - Sleep? - Uh-huh. I went to bed at 3 this morning. You wish anything? Yeah, bring us 2. -2 what, sir? -2 anything! Let's go places. I'm not sleepy. Swell. Now maybe we'll get somewhere. Maybe. Why is it I do alright with every girl but you? And perversely, you're just the one I want. On account of you, I've thrown over all Am I to be the 7th, Mr. Bluebeard? - Won't you be the 7th? - You put it so nicely. Of course, I... I know Don's the great love. But must it always be the great love? No little... detours? Oh, I wouldn't say that. Well, what's the matter, dear? What's wrong? You look as though you'd seen a ghost. It's nothing. Let's go. - Taxi. - Taxi! I guess I won't need you after all, old man. The ice hasn't arrived yet. The service here is terrible. And Herbert owns the place. Who? Herbert Smith. My husband, stupid! Oh. - Well, let's have it straight, with a chaser. -Suits me. - Well? - You and me. Don. What's the matter with you? I've told you before. But I'm leaving him. What do you mean? I'm crazy about you. - Peggy... - Don't talk. - Looking for someone? - I'm not speaking to you. - You're in my rooms. - Yes, and so is Don. - Then I'll ask you to go. - She wants us to go home. - I said, I want YOU to go. - Come on, Don. Are you coming? Mother says, "Are you coming home, little boy?" Peggy, would you mind leaving us alone for a few minutes? Please. Jealous. That's right. Jealous. - Like a wife. - Like a wife. - Want husband to come home. - No, I don't want husband to come home. It's clear to you now, isn't it, Don? It must be clear even to you. It won't work. It takes 2 people who can be trusted. Meaning me. What about you and Nick? That's right. Me too. We're not noble enough to carry out our noble experiment. Yeah, well, I guess not. We're just human. Goodbye, Don. "Let's be friends. " No, thanks. Goodbye means goodbye. It's what you want, isn't it? It's what YOU want, isn't it? Yes, it's what I want. No hard feelings. We tried. No go. No go. - Ready? - Yes. - Where to? - Anywhere. Fine. Don! - Taxi, please. - Taxi! - No rebound? - No rebound. I've locked the door. And thrown the key down a deep well. I can still scream. Oh no you can't. I'll smother you with kisses. You talk like a novelette. "Reading time: 11 and a half minutes. " I'm not going to let you bluff me tonight, Helen. Not tonight... Better be careful. At school I was known as the athletic type. Oh, yeah? Well, if you're finished now, Nick, I think I'd better run along. I'm not going to let you go, Helen. You'd better start screaming. The Marines. Yes? Well, Van, what's up? Nothing's up. Everything's down. I knew your apartment was near, so I ran up. How are you? Greetings. I don't get you, Van. What's down? We're having a party at Renee's. We ran out of scotch. You don't mind if I borrow No, certainly not. Go right ahead. Make yourself at home. A party at Renee's? I haven't seen her for over a week. Guess I'll go along. Oh, that's swell. That's fine. Why don't you come too, Nick? If you know anybody that's lonesome, call them up. Call everybody up. - Goodnight. -Thanks, Nick. I'm glad I didn't disturb you. This is goodnight? Yes, Van. Thanks for seeing me home. I've always admired you, Helen. You're beautiful. Not as beautiful as Iris, mind you. But you're beautiful. Thanks, Van. You're sweet. Helen, I don't suppose you could be interested in me, could you? Oh, don't get me wrong. Nothing serious. You know how it is. No, Van, I'm afraid I couldn't be interested. - There's no harm in asking. - No harm at all. Good night, Van. Goodnight. Helen. Oh, darling... I'm so ashamed of myself for causing that terrible scene. Don, I didn't know what to do. - Then Nick told me to his apartment. - You needn't tell me. I want to tell you. We were kidding, and... oh, then it wasn't funny anymore. He didn't...? You didn't...? No. I ran down to the street, looking for you. And Van came to Nick's. Talk about an angel in disguise! And brought me home. And would you believe it, he propositioned me on the sidewalk! Van? But that's how it always will be, when a wife leaves her husband. For any reason. Darling, it may not be perfect living together all the time, but... It hurts both ways. And this way it hurts less. It's getting late, Mrs. Peterson. May I stay here tonight? I'm afraid not, Mr. Peterson. Call on me again some time. It's a cold, bleak night. You wouldn't turn me out in a storm, would you? I'm that kind of a girl, Mr. Peterson. Move over, sweetheart. Your husband is home to stay. THE END [English subs by adimond]
