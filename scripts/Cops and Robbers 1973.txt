Very, very heavy traffic this morning. Bumper to bumper... Will you move your ass? Look at him! He's got room up there and he doesn't move! Move! What is it with all this traffic? Nobody's budging, for Christ's sake. This traffic shouldn't build up... for at least another 2 exits. Does everybody work at 7:00... in this goddamn town? Aw, Christ, is it hot. Jeez. Coming up, the lower BQE out of the Brooklyn Bridge... be prepared to squeeze to your left again. The Manhattan-Williamsburg Bridge is moving... What are you gonna do? ...might serve as a possible alternative into the city. An accident... You gotta take the good with the bad, right? Starting out at the Lincoln Tunnel... You get up, you go in, you do your job... you make a buck, you go home. What the hell's the use of complaining, right? What the hell are you honking about? l can't move until he moves, you idiot! Forget it. They got the nerve to call this an expressway. Look at that cool son of a bitch... sitting there in his air-conditioned... Lincoln Continental. Yeah. l know. And his lane moves before ours, right? Hmm... lt figures. ...an annual yield of 5.20% a year. Now, either way, you're moving straight to financial security. That's at the Capitalists and lmmigrants Trust... a member of FDlC. Tom. The time right now-- it's 7:05. Hmm? Remember that liquor store... a couple of weeks ago? Guy knocked it off disguised as a cop? Yeah. That was me. lt's too early in the morning for put-ons. l'm not putting you on, Tommy. l got 233 bucks. On the level? On a stack of Bibles. -You really did it. -Yeah, l really did it. What do you think of your old buddy now? Boy, you got some pair of balls. You bet your sweet ass. They clang when l walk. Let's get to work. The thing that really got me... was how easy it was. Walk in, take it, walk out. What about the clerk? He give you a hassle or what? l got a gun up his nose. ls he gonna get a medal holding his boss' dough? Right. Right. lt was so easy. To this day, l can't believe how easy it was. Want to hear something really spooky? Yeah, sure. Ever since it happened, it's never been better... in the sack with Grace and l. You know what l mean? Go figure it out. All right, let's listen up. Be on the lookout for 3 1/2 cans-- thermite, ignition mixture-- stolen from City College. The perpetrators are unknown at this time. Some of it may be outdated. However, it can be used as follows... a report from... ...and l paid my admission. You know, l made friends... and this fella took me home... Hey, Sarge. We got Polansky. Can l let him go upstairs? Then he pulled out an attache case, you know? And he had flashbulbs... and he had all kind of nudity-type costumes... Hey, Louie, l've got the pictures. This is you, baby. We got you and we got you right. This is your whole modus operandi. lt can't be anybody else but you. What do you mean, my M.O.? That was my M.O. you understand? lf l had an M.O., my new M.O. today... would be banks and armored cars... and as soon as l went in, bang, bang, bang. There'd be no witnesses, you understand? l tell ya. Well, this time there was witnesses. Man, l don't even want to hear that word. Those are seeds. No drugs, seeds. Lab canary seeds for my bird. Well, where'd you get the seeds? Where'd l get the seeds? Hey, Joe! What are you gonna do now? l'm not gonna give it back... if that's what you mean. l mean, are you gonna do it again? l don't know. See you around. Did you get anything? Not from that son of a bitch. He gets a ticket. Don't worry about it. l'll get us another one. Speeding, broken taillight. What else could l hit him with? Oh, hey, easy in the pool, huh? ...streets and sewers, built to suit yourself on rambling, quarter-acre, wooded lots... with a lovely view of Acapulco Lake. Efficient, clean, country air... luxurious space... Well, this will not make any Singapore slings. We'll have a gin and tonic... like everybody else, all right? OK. Sure there's enough food? There's plenty. How's Maximillian doing? Good. Huh? Mmm! Be careful, hear? -Got it? -Yeah. George, you're a screwdriver, right? Damn right l am! Ohh! ls everybody happy? ls everybody happy? How you guys can stand the... Relax. l try, but even in my own backyard... George. Boy, l thank God... l got out of that rat race 5 years ago-- everybody pushing everybody around... everybody chiseling a buck... even the cops tearing off a little here and there. lt's a natural result of congestion. lt's the way of the world, George. Not out here. Out here, it's just like anyplace else. You know, you guys think that everybody is a crook. lt's being a cop in the city that gives you that idea... seeing all that corruption, having a little part in it. You got a bug up your back about something? lt's all right, Joe. What's he getting at? He's not getting at anything. Hey, George, a lot of civilians... can't quite make it on their salaries. You see what l mean? l mean, the city distorts your mind. l mean, you think everybody's a crook. George, you come home every night... with a sack of groceries, right? You don't do that with any employee discount. You just pack up the bag... and walk out the door, right, Georgie? Now, wait a minute. That's a prerogative of my managerial position. Now, if the salary that l was paid... reflected my true value to the firm-- you'd do the same thing in spades, George. Look, everybody hustles. Nobody likes it. What are you gonna do? The way l look at it, George... there's this many people, there's this much money. So we gotta steal a little... to make up the difference, right? Well, now, there l can go along with you. l mean, it's right. You gotta make up the difference. Like me in the supermarket... you guys trying to get what you can get. But the point is this-- Hey, George, will you knock off that crap?! l'm sick and tired of hearing people... talk about all the corruption that cops are involved in. People don't know the first thing... about what the hell they're talking about! lf Tommy and l wanted to be corrupt... we could get anything we want! With all we know and with the position we're in... we could get anything, man... and l'm not talking frozen broccoli... or potato chips, pal. l mean anything. You know what anything is? Anything! But we're good cops... so we control ourselves. He's right, Georgie. Tom? Tom, come on. We're gonna take some pictures now. To be used as evidence against us in the morning. Be right there, Mary. You know, George, you're not a bad guy... but you love to bust chops, don't you? Hey, let's get the cops together, huh? We'll have a mug shot. Hey, Joe, gonna get in the lineup? How about the lineup? OK, sweetheart. We're gonna shoot now. l want that big smile, now. Let's do the smile now. All set? OK. All together. Daniel, get out of there. You're not in the family. Get out of here. OK, smile. Hold it, honey! Hold it! Smile! You forgot to look at the camera! Get your goddamn hands off of me! Lady, we're the police! Let me go! l love my husband! Hold her down nice and firm! Aw, throw her in! l'm not gonna deal with this! Hey, get back here! Stop the bleeding! For what?! You do your job... l do my job! You're a cop! Hold her against the door. You son of a bitch, stop this bleeding! -No! -Where's the stiff? ln the rear apartment in the kitchen. She cut him to pieces. Let's get her out of here. l want my husband! He's dead, all right. Look, why don't you just get up front... make another call to the ambulance... get them over here. l'll be up there in a minute. l gotta deal with these 2 chickens. Calm down! God. l gotta do 2 jobs. l gotta hold 'em down, dealing with you cops-- You son of a bitch! lt's made with those good, old-fashioned ingredients... that just can't hurt your hair... no matter how often you shampoo. You can use it twice a week... every other day, even every day. Together Forever was made by our kind of people... for our kind of people... and it's completely biodegradable. You can't treat me like this. You killed a guy. That's enough for one day, huh? l didn't kill nobody. Nobody killed nobody. Sure. Right. l didn't mean to. l come home... and find him with... my baby. What's gonna happen to me? There were 2 of them? Yes. And they came in through the service entrance? They struck my maid... and cut the inside of her mouth. l sent her downstairs to see my doctor. l can have her sent back up if you need a statement. Maybe later. l can't think why they struck her. After all, she's black. And then they came in here, is that it? They never came in here at all, thank goodness. l have some rather valuable things in here. They went from the kitchen into the bedroom. -Where were you? -ln my office. lt connects with the bedroom. l heard them rummaging and opened the door. As soon as l saw them, of course... l realized what they were doing. Then you closed the door? Yes. What did they take? A typewriter, portable TV... and a Mixmaster. Do you have the serial numbers? Well, can you give me... a description of the intruders? l honestly didn't see their faces. How much would a thing like this cost? l beg your pardon? This thing. How much would it go for? l believe it was $3,700. Under 4,000. For this? Where were we? What's your husband do? He's an attorney. l don't see what this has to do-- l was gonna be a lawyer. l went to night school for 2 years. l had to quit when my wife had a baby. Little girl. l believe you wanted a description. Yes, of the intruders. Joe, what would you do if you had $1 million? Go to Montana with Chet Huntley. l mean, really? Go to Montana with Grace. Welcome to Wood Down, the land of plenty. But we're here, right? You know what you told George last week-- that we could get anything we want... only we control ourselves? Well, what the hell? Why don't we? Why don't we what? Pull off a job. l bet with all we know, we'd never get caught. You mean, like my liquor store? l mean a big job. A supermarket? No. Like a bank or a loan company. You ever think about doing something like that? Once in a while. Yeah. Me, too. Why don't we do it? Get everything we want, huh? Pull off, like, a fantastic score. You know, something really big? Like what? Who cares? The city's full of money. We take our pick. One job, one million bucks. We get in, we get out. A million bucks? l'm serious, Joe. Something really big. l get a thrill just thinking about it. Anything we want, huh? One job, one million bucks. Can you imagine? A million bucks? Hey, l wonder what the Chinese would pay... if we kidnaped their ambassador? The Chinese don't have an ambassador. The U.N. guy. Are you kidding? Why not? They've got American money. Where the hell are we gonna stash... the Chinese Ambassador? ln the garage. ln your garage. OK, one day my garage, one day your garage. We don't want something we have to give back. We want something we can turn over real fast... and we need a buyer. Someone with a lot of money. Yeah. A nice, rich person. What's your name? Come on, Randy, you know my name. Big Tony? Anthony Morall. What's your occupation, Anthony? What'd you say? What do you do for a living? Wholesale meat. -A butcher? -That's right. Ed, will you hold this for me... while l print that guy? What's your name? Patsy O'Neill. You didn't have to pull me in. All you had to do was reach out. l would have come. We know that. What's your occupation, Mr. O'Neill? l buy and l sell. You buy and you sell. A salesman. Salesman. All he had on him was this piece, boss. Sit down. You're wearing a wig. The feds take movies here. l don't want to be identified. Mustache phony, too? Looks better than the rug. You tell me you got no papers on you, huh? No wallet, driver's license, nothing. l don't want you to know who l am. You're a cop, right? Right. And you came here all by yourself? Right. We don't take no defectors. l'm not offering to enlist. But you want to do something for me, right? l want to sell you something... for $2 million cash. What bullshit is this, huh? Fast talker, boss. Look, l'm a cop. l got a friend who's a cop, right? We can go anywhere in New York... and get you anything you want... if you just tell us what it is... you'll pay $2 million for, and you see if it's bullshit. You want to rob something for me, right? That you'll pay and that we can handle. There isn't a D.A. in the world... would be dumb enough to... to set this up. This has got to be your own thing. How can you get hurt? l don't have a recorder on me... and if l did, it's entrapment. You know that as well as l do. Securities. Securities? Treasury bonds, bearer bonds. l don't want anything with a name on it. lf the certificate has an owner's name on it... l don't want it. Only papers that say, ''Pay to the bearer.'' That's rich people's money, right? That's right. Rich, rich, yes. Very good. Very good. l'll, uh... pay you 20 cents on the dollar. What? A fifth? l'm offering you a good price... because you're gonna deal in volume. Usually it's 10 cents on the dollar. lf it says, ''Pay to the bearer...'' why don't l deal it myself? Because you want to get the paper... back into legitimate trade. Hey, Angie, come here. Come here! Angelino, come here! l just remembered. So we have to take $10 million worth... to get 2 million from you, right? That's right. Nothing big. How big do they get? No certificates over 100,000. U.S. Treasury goes up to a million... but they're impossible to move. Stick to the small stuff, How about payment? Well, you get the stuff first. ls there a number that's good, some-- You give me your number. My number? Oh, forget it. My wife isn't in on it. Your wife isn't in on it? Your wife isn't in on it. All of a sudden... l believe you're on the level, kid. l am on the level. How good's your memory? lt's good. You call from a phone booth... a booth you're sure of. You'll ask, ''ls Archie there?'' They'll say, ''No.'' You'll leave a number. Archie should call you back. You'll hear from me in 15 minutes. lf not, try again later. When you call, you say your name is Mr. Bux. B-u-x. Spell it. And don't call me with questions. You take $10 million in securities... from Wall Street... l'm gonna read about it in the newspaper. l don't read about it in the newspaper... l don't call back. Hand me that box. Take one. Havanas. Thanks. This one's for your friend... with the dog. Nice talkin' to ya, kid. You'll be hearing from me. That's fine. Give him his gun at the gate. He covered himself good. -You make him? -No. Smart and stupid at the same time... just like a cop. l want his name, address... and what he really does for a living. You got it, boss. OK, hold it up here. Just relax. Hold it up. Just hold it up. Relax, relax. Excuse me, officer-- lt'll only be a minute, only be a minute. Easy! Easy, easy! -What's the problem? -The toilet backed up. Hey, what's your hurry? You know what O'Neill had in his house? A bowling alley. No shit? Go tell him crime doesn't pay. What is it he wants us to rob? They're called bearer bonds. They're pieces of paper. They're not heavy, no trouble. We walk in, we take 'em... and we turn 'em right over. Hey... he smokes Havana cigars. Joe, l tell you, this is our guy. We're going to the South Seas, kiddo. ...28, down one. Pfizer 38 1/8, up 1/8. Allied Chemical U.S. Steel 31 1/2... lt's a world of cops and robbers ...down 5/8. On the American Stock Exchange... sales totaled Help! Jesus Christ! Shit! Hey, grab it-- it's an artery. Grab it right there. The money. The money! He's got my money! Shut up about the money! He took my money! Will you walk?! Hey. Hey, l'm afraid to look. ls it--is it, uh... hey. ls it... Don't worry. Your goods are intact. Almost had his leg shot off! he's shot in the balls. A little higher, he's shot in the heart-- he's dead. l can't wait till we do it... and get the hell out of all this. What about the wives? What about them? What do we tell them? Nothing. What do you mean, ''nothing''? ln the first place, they'll worry. ln the second place, they'll be against it. ln the third place, it's none of their business. Yeah, well, l don't know about Grace... but if Mary suddenly finds herself... in Trinidad with a million bucks... she's gonna suspect something. Well, l'm not telling Grace... till we get to Saskatchewan. Get out here. Where? Saskatchewan. lt's in Canada. l heard they got terrific farmland... up there that's available. Grace and l always wanted to be farmers. What happened to the old guy... that was here when they first brought you in? Even though he was so sick... he was able to joke and crack everybody up. Terrific guy. What did they do, take him home? No. He died. ln the middle of the night, he fell right out of bed. l woke up. lt scared the crap out of me. He wanted to get out of here... and start doing things. Like what? He didn't know. Well, it's getting a little late. l think maybe l better split. Well, you got your 20 now. Right. Well, l'm gonna go. l'll, uh, see you around, Paul. Take it easy, huh? Thanks for the peaches. Hold it! Stay down, stay down! ...to the hallway. Where the hell are you going?! -After them! -Jesus Christ! They got a shotgun! They'll blow your ass off! They'll get away! Who the hell gives a shit? Get back in the car, cowboy! Come on, Wyatt Earp. Go call in. They shot the shit out of our radiator. Tell 'em we need new wheels. And put your piece away... before you blow your foot off. You slow me up, all right? Old timer. All the yo-yos l get. Paul, get well! Come back! Give me a break, Joe! Doc Holliday! You're gonna kill me! We tell the wives now, we'll never do it. OK. We don't tell 'em till it's over. Not for 2 years, right? Yeah. That's another thing. l've been thinking about that. -Joe, we agreed. -l know we agreed... but l don't want a million bucks... buried in the ground... and l get buried right alongside it. We just can't do it and run, for Christ sake. Yeah, yeah, l know, but 2 years is too long. What do you suggest? -3 months. -You're crazy. What do you suggest? -A year and a half. -9 months. -A year. -You got it. -Hand me the wrench. -Get it yourself. Thanks, Jack. Take care. May l help you? -Hey, is that me? -Yeah. What can l do for you? Jeez, l never been on television before. Are you a messenger? No, l'm just, uh-- l'm looking for the employment office. l'm supposed to come to work here. Yeah, it's down on the eighth floor. Then l'm in the wrong place, huh? That's right. Thanks. Swanee We get 'em all. l got it. We do a bomb scare. We phone in... tell 'em there's a bomb in the vault... then we answer the run ourselves. -Won't work. -But it will work. lt gets us in. That's the beauty! And a couple of other cops answer the run... before we get out again. Shit! The problem isn't to get in. The problem is to get out again with the bonds... and where we stash them. lt's impossible. We'll never figure it out. l'm gettin' a goddamn headache from thinking. ''August 17, a week from Wednesday. 2:00. Parade for the astronauts.'' That's when we do it. With all those mobs? How do we get out of there? ln a radio car. ''150,000 people... ''are lining the streets of Lower Manhattan... ''to watch the astronauts parade up Broadway... ''to City Hall. assigned to the job.'' You know the car? Your radio car... and the trouble you've been having? Well, here's what happens. l have a very nervous stomach. Don't think about it. You give great advice. We get in, we make our move. lf we can't get to the vault... we back down and get out quick. Yes, officers? Got a complaint about objectionable items... ejected from windows on the northeast corner... of the building. What? Somebody's throwin' junk out the windows. From this floor? That's right. Gotta check it out. Well, l'll call Mr. Eastpoole. Yes, Miss Wells? l got 2 cops here. Say there's stuff being thrown out the window. He'll be right out. We'll go back and meet him. l'm sorry. l can't let you do that. You can't get back there without an escort. You can't let us in? l'm sorry, officer, but that's my instructions. Not much doin' here today, huh? Nah, not with that parade down there. They might as well close up shop. Good day for a robbery. They'd never get through those doors. And if they did... they'd never get back out again. He's coming now. Mr. Eastpoole's the senior partner here. He'll take care of you. Yes, officers. What can l do for you? You Eastpoole? l'm Mr. Eastpoole, yes. What can l do for you? We had a complaint about objects... ejected from your windows, Mr. Eastpoole. From these offices? That's the report we got, Mr. Eastpoole. Have to check out the northeast corner. Where's the other guard, Jack? He, uh, went to the men's room, sir. You mean he's leaning out the window... watching the parade. Uh, he'll be right back, Mr. Eastpoole. We pay for 2 men at this counter... Look, Mr. Eastpoole... l think we better check things out. You know, quickly, before some innocent bystander... gets his head cracked open down there. You know what l mean, Mr. Eastpoole? All right. Come along. Hello. This is Jack out front. Right. ls Harry there? Right. Will you tell him to haul his ass out here? Eastpoole was just out. Hold it. ls there a camera here? Can that guard check this area? No, there's no need, and there are no windows. -What you want-- -We know what we want. Let's go to your office. Why? We don't have to show you our guns, do we? -What is this? -lt's a robbery. What do you think it is? Mr. Hutchinson called. Miss Wells, these people are here-- lt's all right, miss. There's nothing to worry about. What's the matter? They're not really police. We're desperate criminals, ma'am. We're engaged in a major robbery. There's no way you can get away with this. Any of those guards start getting excited... while we're here... and you're all through, Mr. Eastpoole. You don't have to threaten me. l'll cooperate. The authorities will pick you people up later. Now, that's the way to think, Mr. Eastpoole. l don't know what you expect to accomplish anyway. We deal in securities here. We don't have cash. We're not looking for cash, Mr. Eastpoole. We want bearer bonds. -Bearer bonds? -$10 million worth. What denomination? Nothing over $100,000, nothing under 20. All right, look. You and l are gonna wait here... while my partner and your lady friend... take a little walk to the vault. You understand, Mr. Eastpoole? l can't. Yes, you can. You're gonna do just fine. lt's all right, Miss Wells. We don't want any violence. You do just as they say... and nobody will get hurt. Now, you go to the Morrison fund drawer... and you'll find just what they want. Bearer bonds. Nothing over 100,000. They'll want 10 million. You may have to make up the difference... from the Ely Kay Corporation. You know which drawer that is. Yes, sir. Now just be calm, do just what l say... and everything will be all right. We don't want any violence, Miss Wells. Of course not. Sit down. l don't want a whole lot of shooting. Neither do l. We walk right to the vault. l understand. All we want is the money... and none of it's yours. -Right? -Exactly. There are TV cameras in there, right? l'm gonna wait for you right here. Now remember, when you get in to that vault... my partner can watch you on the monitor. l'll do just as you wish. OK. Go. -Hello, Miss Wells. -Hello, Girard. Lots of excitement out there today. Yes, so it seems. Astronauts go by yet? No, not yet. lt's a long parade. Yes, isn't it? Attagirl. Come on, come on. What the-- wait a minute. What the hell is going on?! -Who are they? -l don't know. What the hell is that?! l swear l don't know! Who called them?! Answer it! You gotta be careful, or l'll blow your brains out. Pick it up! What?! What do they-- one moment, one moment. They want to search the offices. What for? a messenger in the elevator. Oh, my Christ. l gotta tell them something. You're calling the shots. All right, tell them to go ahead and search... but not in here. Very well, go ahead and search... but not in this office. They can be sure there's no one here. All right, get me the vault. l wanna talk to that girl. Hurry up, hurry up! Come on. lt's ringing. Come on, come on! Hello, Miss Wells. What route are they taking back? l'm trying to think! Anything goes wrong, l swear to God... you're the first one dead. lt's ringing. Hello? ls Miss Wells there? No, sir, Mr. Eastpoole. She hasn't been through yet. Yes. Bye. You son of a bitch, you signaled! But l didn't! You're a dead man. OK, OK. What happened, damn it? l tried to call you. There's cops all over the place. What the hell's going on? There was a robbery in the elevator. A messenger was killed. Killed? Shit! -What's in there? -A john. Lock them up. We're getting out of here. Come on. Get in here. Move, move! l'll do that. lt's all right, Janet. lt'll all be over soon. You won't be here too long. l'll leave the light on. OK, Mr. Eastpoole? What the hell are you doing?! Getting us out of here. What are you, crazy? Listen to me. There's been a killing. They're gonna search everybody, even us. Joe, l know what l'm doing. lf there's no evidence, there's no crime. What the hell are you talking about? l'm talking about tomorrow's newspaper. When O'Neill sees that, he'll see we got the whole thing. Joe, Joe, we're stealing a headline. All he has to do is think we got the bonds. Now will you help me throw this out... so we can get out of here? You bet your life. We're stealing a headline! Beautiful! We're getting it all, Joe. We're gonna pull it off, no matter what happens. Whoo hoo! Hurry, hurry! l'm hurrying! What do you want from me? Come on. Get everything! Jesus Christ! Get these! Get these! Wait a minute--here come the men in blue. Hey, schmucks... what are you doing with your lives? Hurry up! Whoo! Come on, come on. Get it all! Look at this! Beautiful! Whoo hoo! Here come the astronauts! They're smiling. That's the last of them. Beautiful! Let's get the hell out of here! There's some over here. Get every last piece. l will, l will. Now get the window. Come on, let's get out of here. Let's get out of here. We gotta get an escort to get out of here. So, we'll get an escort. -Miss. -Yes? Could you show us where the elevators are? Sure. You go right over here-- l'd sure appreciate it if you'd show us. Uh, OK. Come on. Those other cops are coming out. l wonder if they found anything. Sure. Why not? Find anything? Aw, must have been a different floor. Maybe they just stopped doing it. lt could be. They'll let anybody be a cop these days. Hello, Neil and Buzz. l'm talking to you by telephone... from the Oval Room at The White House. Hey, how's it going? l just can't tell you... how proud we all are of what you've... Disguised as police officers... in a daring daylight robbery... penetrated the sophisticated electronic defenses... of the prestigious Wall Street firm... of Parker, Tillman, Eastpoole... in what may turn out to be the largest stock theft... in Wall Street history. The ringleaders of the carefully-planned... and brilliantly-engineered robbery... entered the brokerage offices... under cover of a ticker tape parade... honoring astronauts... ...the firm Parker, Tillman, and Eastpoole. According to Raymond Eastpoole... the senior partner in the brokerage house... the gang made off yesterday afternoon... with $1 2 million in negotiable-- $1 2 million? The perpetrators entered the premises... at approximately 1 :10 P.M. They gained access to the brokerage office... by impersonating police officers... responding to a complaint. ls there any chance at all... that these were real policemen? Well, l'll tell you, Lou, definitely not. Their behavior was definitely eccentric. You just don't have police personnel... behaving... in that fashion. Then you're confident that the thieves... have no connection with the police department? Absolutely not. l don't get it. Eastpoole and that secretary. That's why they cooperated. What do you mean? Eastpoole. He ripped off $2 million. What?! We stole 10, he reported 1 2. That's $1 million apiece-- one for him and one for her. The perfect crime. Right. And we pulled it for them. That slick son of a bitch. Watch the road. The professional criminals who masterminded... yesterday's daring daylight robbery on Wall Street... have created embarrassment for the police department... in their use of police uniforms... Hey, Marty. Reporter Lou Wood spoke with Police Commissioner Evinrude... Hello, Pasquale. Any chance at all that these actually were... How are you, Mr. Joe? l can't complain. We do not believe that this is a crime... which police officers would have committed. The police force is not perfect... but armed robbery is not a matter of police crime. ls it possible that the getaway car... really was a police car? -You mean stolen? -Well, stolen or borrowed. The possibility is being investigated. So far, we have no evidence of any missing police vehicles. -Or borrowed? -Or borrowed. And that possibility is being investigated? All possibilities are being investigated. How's your family? Very well, thank you. That's the most important thing. That's true. And how's your family? They're all right, thank God. Good. How's Carmella feeling? My mother? Much better, thank you. Good. ...in which they were originally submitted... allowing conditions in paperwork conducive to cover-up. What about this thing? l never thought they'd do it. l'm happy for you, Pasquale. Thank you, Mr. Joe. The only thing is, l didn't expect it. You ain't got no cash? Put it all into that Santo Domingo thing. Use a bag full of newspapers. Or use a dozen rolls. Take out 100,000. lt won't work, Mr. Joe. They'll have to see it all before they go for it. -How much? -2 million. That's a lot of cash. l got the people, Mr. Joe. l can smother them. Are they cops or ain't they? What's the difference? We gotta hit 'em, and we'll hit 'em. But quietly. Quietly, Mr. Joe. Well... all right. But it's your responsibility, the whole thing. l understand, Mr. Joe. Reporter Frank Disney spoke with private guards... John Garrity and Harold Loomis. Did the perpetrators... seem to know police procedure pretty well? Well, Frank, l'll tell you... l was suspicious of them right from the start. They just didn't act right. l was 27 years on the force, Bridgeport, Connecticut. l know a cop when l see one. Did you act on your suspicions at the time? Well, l kept an eye on them. Could have been a ruse, you know. My job is to stay at my post... not get drawn away. Then, in your judgment... the thieves were not actual police officers? Not a chance. Their hair was too long. So when do we call your Mafia guy? Pretty soon. You're already past pretty soon. Seems more like never. Last week, l went into a phone booth. That took a lot of guts. Couple weeks from now... you'll probably drop a dime in. l don't know. lt's like we already got away with it. Why push our luck, you know what l mean? Got away with what? So far, all we got is air. l'm scared of O'Neill, damn it. Look, l was afraid of the robbery. l was scared out of my head. But we did it. This time, we could get killed. Do we do it, or don't we do it? Yeah, we do it. l'm expecting-- Well, l have to make a call, too! What do you think, it's your phone booth? Hello. This is Mr. Bux. B-U-X. Yeah, we need a time to set up. No, we'll tell you where. Abercrombie & Fitch has a wicker picnic basket. lt's about 38 bucks with tax. lt's the only one they have at that price, right? Next Sunday, 3:00, in Central Park. Yeah. Right. Central Park. Because it's Bicycle Day and there's no cars allowed. Because we don't trust you, right? All right. You send no more than four people... two of them female, into the park from the west... at 76th street. Carry the goods in one of those picnic baskets. l'm Mr.. Bux. B-U-X. You got the package? You got yours? Now, l'm not gonna make any sudden moves... but l'm gonna reach my hand in there and take a few. Who says? That's the way it's gotta be. l have to see your goods. You'll see them. Wanna make the switch or not? Hey, Marty, cops there. Yeah, l know about that. That's my partner. Let's get on with it. You got the stuff in the car? We don't make any more moves until l check out your basket. Sure, why not? l'll do it. There's no way you can get a thing with this. Well, call your partner over, and we'll talk. You want the goods, show us the money. Relax. lt's good. They got wheels? A police car? What's happening? l spotted six guys out there so far. There's gotta be more, right? They really don't want us to get out of here, do they? Hey, Marty, l hope you know what you're doing. That's Papa Joe's bread. Don't worry about it. lt's all right. lt's all right. They look all right to me. What do you think? l don't know. l guess they're OK. We'll make the switch right now. Go talk to your people. You really as cool as all that, or is it bullshit? lt's bullshit. What are you gonna do? You still gotta look it over? Yeah--in the car. The car? ln the car. We make the switch in the car... or my partner leaves right now. OK. lt's all right. lt's better inside. Go ahead. Leave that basket right where it is. Keep your hands down. You make one move, l'll blow your head... right out the window. You guys know what you're doing? l hope you do 'cause if you don't, we're all dead. Come back! Hey! Hey, hold it! Get out of the way, stupid! Shit! They got us blocked! Try another exit. Yeah, why don't you do that? Keep your face shut! Austin Drive? Seventeeth. OK. Don't worry about it. Just keep them bottled up. lt doesn't change anything. Come on, get out of the way! Oh, Christ, they got this one blocked off, too! What the hell, is the whole park sealed off?! l told you not to touch that. What is this? You guys are really stupid. l can't believe how stupid you are. Get him out of here! You're not going anywhere. No, but you are. Get out! Yeah, that's a good idea. lf l stay in the car with you two guys... l'll be a dead man. Get out! Get out! Turn around. Turn around. Look at this! l know these guys. They got us covered good. Looks like they got the whole softball team with them. Joe, move out, move out. OK, OK! Move, move! Jesus Christ. Get out of there! Get out of the way! Hey, get out of the way, or l'll run you over! Come on! Get out! Get out of the way, will ya? Come on! Get back here! Hold it! Get away from the car. l'm a cop! l'll blow your brains out! You stupid... Get out of here. Keep him outside. This is a Buster Keaton movie. These guys are really stupid. Hey, over here. You know what this means, pal? You know what this means? And this one, too! This guy's got a piece in his back pocket. Who the hell are these guys? They're with O'Neill! How many men do they have, for Christ's sake? They're all over the place. They can't all be ltalian! Where the hell is the difference? They got guns. They got guns. They're trying to take us somewhere. Hey, look over there. Joe, calm down. Let's just be cool. Be cool. Get out of here! At least we're rid of those goons. Yeah. Here they come again. We've had it. We'll never get outta here, goddamn it! Yeah? Watch this move. l'm gonna put this tub... right back where we stole it from. What are you doin'? Hang on, baby. Here we go. Joe, what are you doin'? Get ready! Joe! Joe! Here we go! Oh, wow. Have l got big ones or not? You've got 'em. Let's get outta here. Jesus Christ. Come on. Come on. -How you doin'? -Nice. Hey, you with the basket. You sure you took the right basket out of the car? Are you kidding? Of course. Over here, we got it! Allied Chemical Christ was the first to rise from the dead. Let us entrust our brother Pasquale... to the God, that he... may raise him again in the last days... and make him one of his saints in his kingdom. Let us pray to Jesus Christ our Lord... who helped poor Lazarus when he was dead. May he wipe the tears from our eyes... that you who raised the dead to life... may give another life to Pasquale, our brother. Let us pray to the Lord. That you who promised paradise to the repentant... may he take Pasquale, our brother, into heaven. Let us pray to the Lord.
