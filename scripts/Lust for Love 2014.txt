We broke up yesterday. You were dating her? Um... I want you to help me get her back. Oh, Mila and I aren't friends anymore. - That's okay. - She hasn't changed at all. Oh, well, you're probably better off, then. She was never interested in people for the right reasons, anyway. Yeah. Look, Mila wants a ladies man, confident guy who gets all the girls. It's not you, is it? I could learn. Uh... You could teach me. I just need techniques that work. 4:00? 3 past. Would you like to grab a coffee? You had to ask the time before you knew you wanted to ask me out? Asking the time was my in. I couldn't hit on you straight up. - Well, you should've asked straight up. - It shows confidence. - Okay. Okay. - Let's go again. Hey, what's up, girl? Want to roll with me, get some coffee? Yeah, I want to roll with you, right off my feet off the sidewalk and into the gutter. - Let's do it. - Ain't happening. You're putting on a persona. Are you an actor? - No. - Then why are you acting up now? Hold the bus. 12:00. May not be possible. 10:00, 11:00, stop thinking with your cock. What are you hesitating for? Go. - I can't run after her. - That's desperate. You said never look desperate. You know the deal. Go now. - Ah... Excuse me. - Excuse me. Um, sorry, uh, can I ask you a question? Sure, spit it out. - Oh, that's charming. - Prince charming. - Well, what's the question? - Can I buy you a coffee? Uh, how long is this question you have to ask me over a cup of coffee? That's the question. I don't even know you. I thought you were, I don't know, doing some environmental survey or something. No, I'm just a boy asking a girl for a coffee. - See that machine in there... - Coffee is only $1. Yeah. Go get high. - Congratulations. - Your first win. If I was begging. Asking a random cutie straight up at this stage was guaranteed to get you knocked back. - That was the plan. - An evil plan. To get you used to being knocked back. Didn't hurt much, did it? Hurt like a paper cut on my eyelid. No pain, no game. So you're saying I got game? You're playing the game. You haven't got game. - But I be a player, yo. - All in good time. Right now, you pay to play. You got the money? I have to pay you? No, I was just being silly, but seriously, can I borrow $20? Here you are, sir. - Hey, you idiot. - What? - Oh! Oh! I-I-I-I... - What is this? What am I supposed to do with this? - I-I-I-I'm sorry. - I didn't know. I didn't... you should... but buy your... buy another soda. Buy yourself a soda. Okay. - Sorry, is my son bothering you? - Come on, Astor. - Idiot. - Very sorry. So, how did you and Mila get together? Well, let me tell you about it. Must've been the mixing drinks. Sambuca and bloody Marys don't really go well to-together. - Just one more cabernet. - Well... - Wee. - Oh. When they fight, they fight Oh! And when they come home Oh. - Happy Birthday, Astor. - Your birthday cake. - Thanks, mom. - Cherry, like you like it. Maybe tomorrow. I'm sorry. All right. Okay. Was it too much too soon? Was it little too late? He got the message she left on his car in the rain and then the words that come to you Oh. - Astor. - Hi. Hi. Hi. You just can't let it go You're a little drunk. Oh. Okay. I'm just a little tipsy. Okay. Okay. There's no clocks. Uh-oh. Okay. Sorry. - Okay. - That's my boob. Yeah. You all right? You love me. You're the best. No one loves me like you love me. I love you, too, Mila. Mm. Cold. It's cold in your house. I just puked in my mouth. I told you to go easy. It's not the liquor. It's your sob childhood sweetheart tale. More than half the world is female, and you hold out for someone you liked as a kid. It's kind of pedophilic. True love lasts the ages. True love involves sex, not abstinence. You skipped teenage sex because your 4-year-old self had a crush? I was a late developer. Highest vocal range in the church choir. Oh, so pedophilia came naturally to you, then. She was worth the wait. Sip. Rinse. Spit. Smile. Kiss. 21 years and 43 days since our last kiss. Wow. I think I remember. It was behind the toilets, right? Did we just kiss? - We were 4 years old. - Right, so probably just kissed. That'd be weird. Who do you think's gonna be happier... your mom or mine? Probably yours. Yeah, you're probably right. She knows you're everything I ever wanted. Blind confessions of love ain't gonna cut it with a girl like Mila. If you're too sweet, you'll turn most girls off. You need attitude, edge, and a hell of a lot more confidence. You paying attention? - I'm taking notes. - No, stop. You've got to let it flow, not produce a paper on it. When you're a player, you'll know. The girls will know, and everything will be easy, like shooting fish in a barrel. Hi. One for every day we've been together. Just like Monday. - How's your paper going? - Good. So unfair you get all this work right when we've become a couple. Yeah. I know. I can't really stay out that late either tonight. Sorry. - I've got some good news. - I started studying cardiology. I'm not gonna get a degree like you, but I thought perhaps I could help you study. That's really... that's sweet. I've got another surprise, too. But I'll tell you... I'll tell you about it. I've always been here beside you. Your beauty weakens my knees. You never knew. How could you? Each glance and every word a tease. I couldn't believe it when I had you. I never thought I'd break through. I could only barely hold back the tears from my... Deep and frightful fears. This bond is new. Though it'll go on after we've turned to dust, our children will one day remind you of this beautiful love and trust. Yeah! Ooh. You first. Yeah! Oh. Okay. Okay. Oh, you're so scared. No, I'm fine. I just... okay. You can have it if you want it Ow! Ooh, hey, that's my nipple. Oh. Did I do that? Yeah. When we were 12. That's the cigarette burn? - Yeah. - That's crazy. Your dad caught you smoking, and you panicked and put it out on my chest. You got punished. I still can't cook with a wooden spoon. Should I turn off the lights? Yeah, I'm sobering up anyway. Oh. It's everything you dreamed of what you want - Yeah. - All right. Okay. Just don't blow it everything's going down Oh. I'm surprised you didn't get lost in the dark. I think I might be a natural in the bedroom. Let's wait and see when you've slept with more than one girl. She might've been faking. - Do you fake? - No. If a guy's inadequate, it helps him to know. When I give a compliment, I mean it. Comes from the heart. Or the clitoris. It's not clitoral stimulation that does it for me. - It's inside. - Me, too. It's all about the heart. I'm talking about the g-spot. - Oh, the g-spot. - I'll keep that in mind. And don't worry. I won't write it down. Oh, that one you can tattoo to your hand. - Boo! - Hey. Oh, the main symptoms of V.T. Are... no cheating... palpitations, light-headedness, and...? I think I have V.T. I'm serious. I think I have V.T. I don't want to do the exam. Will you do it for me? Please? I will do anything. - Anything? - Well... ...Maybe not anything. Hey. So, this is the guy you've been hiding, huh? Hi. I am Astor, and, yes, I am the boyfriend. - Hi, I'm Jenny. - Hi, Jenny. - Astor. - Oh. Hi. - Hey. - Hey. Whoa. Sorry. Boyfriend? Want to come pump some iron? Boost your testosterone? Uh, my doctor says I shouldn't... got enough testosterone as it is. Hey, um, did Mila tell you about my birthday party on Saturday? I was just telling him about your birthday party on Saturday. Sounds like fun. - Cool. - Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be fun. Lucky you got out of that one. I got her an 89. You did her exam? I-I could've got it in the 90s if I just knew my aortic stenosis. Any of this help with your zoology degree? My average dropped 10% with the extracurricular studies. I should've played hard to get. - Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! - Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Kiss! Kiss his face! Oh! What?! I was... I was gonna do it! - I know. It's fine. - It's not your fault. - All right. Astor. - Your turn, buddy. Truth or dare? Truth. - What is Mila like in bed? - Boom! Jake, come on. You don't have to answer that. A taste of warm honey. A touch to lift the hairs on your neck. A tongue alive with fire and talent. And a heart that burns with enveloping heat. Wow. That's beautiful. - Yeah. - Well, we're in love. Paging Dr. I am in love. Dr. I am in love. - He's in the honeymoon period. - Dr... I don't... - Look at you. Heart on your sleeve. - You're unstoppable. If you feel it, say it, sister. She's pretty amazing. Hey, what else do you like about her? Uh... I love the way she looks on my bed. - I love the noises she makes. - Astor. No, the noise... the noises she makes when she sleeps. She's the one. I never wanted anyone else. Okay, I-I think it's your turn, Astor. I'm sure everybody else has stories to share, right? Yeah, who do you choose? I choose... Mila. Truth or dare? Anything but truth. So, that's how she got frostbite. I thought it was a myth. I thought I was letting her off the hook. I mean, who knew licking a freezer could be so dangerous. She couldn't even kiss after that. Is she a good kisser? She's got a fiery tongue. But when I said that, I was actually talking about her propensity for anger. Oh. I feel like I'm in junior high dating a 15-year-old swimming-pool lifeguard. Surprised he didn't give me a hickey. I think he's cute. I can't be with someone who's still learning how to undo a bra and confuses honeymoon period with love. I mean, I-I need someone who understands women. You could teach him. And be his tricycle while he learns how to ride a bicycle? No, thank you. Look, he'll settle into the relationship. He keeps giving me flowers and more flowers. They're always tulips. They're not even fragrant. I love tulips. - I-I'm serious. - I am... I'm done dating boys. I want a man who has a choice in women and picks me. Look, I think you found someone unique, okay? - Yeah, uniquely inexperienced. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Have you ever been in love? I'm not the kind of girl that falls in love. You've had your heart broken, too. He must've been a pretty special guy. Nice try. You know you might not be able to win Mila back. It's worth a shot. You're gonna take some hits. Hit me, bitch. I won't be the one hitting you, and you won't be calling me bitch. Biatch! Ow! - You got to be strong, okay? - Water off a duck's back. That's gonna be your motto. Water off a duck's back. Please don't make me try that line again. - The line worked on me. - I went home with the guy. Yeah, a handsome guy, I'm sure. - That's not the point. - It was his delivery. How did I become your Guinea pig? - I bought you in a pet shop. - Chose you for your soft coat. - Hey, hey, hey. - Sensitive. Sensitive. Now get Guinea-pigging. What about her? You can try him if you like. Oh, come on. That girl there. She's perfect. Water off a duck's back. Hi. Sorry, I... I saw you outside before, and I think you dropped this. Uh... That is definitely not mine. - Oh, Jesus. - That's embarrassing. I'm... - Did you say "Jesus"? - Uh-huh. I'm Roman catholic, and I don't believe in taking the lord's name in vain, and I certainly don't believe in sex before marriage. "Purity." Well, it's always a good idea to keep safe. Stop the spread of STDs. I'm Roman catholic. Right. I might go... Confess my sins. What are your sins? Monogamy, mahogany, general misuse of wood. You should definitely keep that to yourself. You're not gonna even finish your drink? How did that line ever work on you? It was my condom that I dropped deliberately. I wanted the guy. - I told you it'd never work. - Okay, fine. But your improvising now, and you've been knocked back three times tonight without even realizing. Didn't we do this lesson already? Yes, but it's the most important lesson. You can't be phased by a rejection. Okay. Okay. I got it. - Wait. - You can't be phased by anything. You know the number-one reason a girl knocks back a guy? - Wrong line? - Nerves. I'm trying to hide my nerves. Her nerves. A rejection's often not really a rejection. It's just a girl being shy, awkward. Got to ride it out. Sail the storm to calmer waters. - Exactly. - Keep the conversation going until it actually becomes a conversation and not just a pickup line. Okay, so you're saying I should've kept talking to mother Mary? Yeah, well, she had a chastity ring on. I think you gave her enough time. She would've spread her legs eventually but not for a few months. Charming. You will be. Okay. Give me a real technique. Thanks. Thank you. Hey. Oh. Oh, sorry. Excuse me. I, uh... Hi. Ooh. Hi. Hey, ladies. Drinks for you courtesy of this guy over here. - Hey there. - Hey. How's it going? - Hi. - Cheers. Cheers. I love Asian girls. All right. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Hey, wait! Come on! Pardon my French, but offering to buy girls drinks... it's fucked. Well, I can't teach you how to be a player in one night. - I-I agree with that. - Hey. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Oh. Come on. Yeah... okay. Yeah, it works. It's good. Simple. Let me see if I got every step right. Grab and pull. Shall we call it the modified cave man? Sorry. Uh, wait. Dancing. Oh. Morning, sunshine. Mm. You didn't go home with Franck? Well, I don't normally kiss and tell, but since we're on topic, yeah, he came home with me. Anything else I can learn from him? Don't be too cool for school. Be passionate. That's the new cool. But Franck's indifferent? No, Franck's passionate. About you? Yeah, he is. But the question is, what are you passionate about? Bubbles? You didn't want to take the lift? Are we allowed to be in here? Shh! Ah. Watch out for the glass. It's a view. We're not just here for the view. I stopped perving on my neighbors when I was 12. Come on. Wow. They better not be bats. They're birds. I'm a birder. It's a stopover on their migration South. They winter in Mexico. How luxurious. Tell a story of a life together every house an allegory like the smell of smoke, it lingers on memory been a long and an uphill battle had to learn how to pray never miracles it's only hope dousing pain my eyes play tricks on me line fades 'tween sky and sea Miles away the hours of heartbreak in dark, they're coming to get me tell a story of a life together Today was so beautiful. You're beautiful. As clichd as a response like that is, it might actually get you somewhere. What about birding? Is that gonna get me in with the ladies? - Why not? - I think it's awesome. You're awesome. The shotgun approach? Hit on every girl you come across? It's a good strategy. Yeah. I'll hit on anything with two legs so long as it doesn't have a penis. What about the one-legged ladies? Why should I rule them out? Less chance of treading on their toes if we go dancing. Pretty unlikely they'll kick me when I'm down. How do you kick with one leg? I'll hit on anything with at least one leg so long as it doesn't have a penis. Don't be so hard on yourself. It takes time. Maybe you need a break. No. I'm ready to get back on the horse. A one-legged horse? What? Yeah, good luck. No, that sounds dangerous. That's not mine. Could you hand it to the server? Hello? - Kirsten? - Yes. - Ah. - Hello. Thank you so much. Did you leave it here earlier? - Yeah. Yeah. I'm an idiot. - I'm sorry. I was sitting right here with some friends just, you know, not even an hour ago. I've been here almost three hours. - Really? - Uh, I... how rude. I didn't introduce myself. Astor. Right. Astor, is that Frenchman over there one of your friends? That one? How do you know he's French? I've never met him before. I've never... I don't... who are you talking about? - What is he smiling about? - Uh... Oh, he's an idiot. Tell me if I'm being crazy here, but is this some sort of elaborate ruse to meet women? You think it's elaborate? Good elaborate, bad elaborate? - Just... just elaborate. - Okay. But look, I've been waiting here alone. My girlfriend left like 20 minutes ago, and I thought I was doing a good deed, but, um, it seems this is just some pathetic pickup strategy. - Okay. W-w-wait. - W-wait. Wait. I'm no good at meeting girls, okay? Women. I'm no good at meeting women. Does that mean I'm not worth knowing? No, I can tell that you're not worth knowing by your dishonest theft of my time. Hmm? Oh, my God. What are you doing? Is there any correlation between a guy's ability to pick up and his quality as a partner? Uh... A guy with no confidence will stay with anyone and endure anything. If you never learn how to talk to women, you won't have the power of a choice. - Mm. - I love a choice cut of meat. Oh, no. Oh. - Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. - No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Mila's friend is right over there. Go talk to him. You have to be friends with Milas friends. No, this guy is awful. - Go. - Okay. Jake. Hey, Jake. Hey. Who you here with? My girlfriend's in the bathroom. Oh. I didn't know you had a girlfriend. New girlfriend. - Oh, cool. - Congratulations. Hey, babe. Hi, Astor. Well, you don't waste any time. - Hey, take it easy, okay? - No. No. No. No. She's easy. I suppose you two just got it on in the toilet? Did she tell you that's her favorite spot? You want to step outside? - Yeah, I want... yeah. - Yes, I want to step outside. I got to, uh, dust off my knuckle dusters first, and I'll b... I'll be waiting for you. - You're a butthead! - You're a headbuttee! What does that even mean? - Hey. - Oh. Ow! So silly, Astor. What? - What happened? - Is my eye still there? What? What are you doing here? - We're with Astor. - Ow, my head. Well, then he can tell you what happened. - I'm not done. - Mila, I forgive you. - Let's just go. - Come on. He headbutted me in the nostril. - Come on. - Oh, come here. I have an orbital fracture. - What? - Aah! - What? - Ow! Ow! My hand! Ah! Oh! Oh, this is so embarrassing. Aah! Oh, hi. Uh... Well, h... hi. What are... I'm... I dropped my keys, so, um, would you mind helping me look for them? Sorry, 'cause I was like, "who is this person?" - Oh, I'm trinity. I'm... - I moved in just off the back. - Oh, you... okay. - I'm Astor. I live right here. - So, we're neighbors. - Neighbor. Yeah, and it's my duty, apparently. - Yeah. - Let me see. Right here, huh? - Yeah, well... - Wait. Wait. Wait. - Is that... is this them? - Yes! - Right here. - Perfect. You're my hero. Here you are. Sorry. Why are you pointing them at me? - Here you go. - It's caught in the... - okay, I'm just gonna... - Stuck on the... - Ooh, that's gonna hurt. - Well, you just... you do that. Okay. I never pick up keys that way. I don't know why I did that. I-I just pick them up normally, like... So, what are you thinking? - Yeah. - Well, um, thank you so much. - Well, it was nice meeting you. - You, too. Perhaps, um, I can come over for a drink sometime. Or you... you can. You come over for a drink. I mean, that's not a command, but if you want, you have... you can do whatever you want. - Sure, that would be... - That'd be nice. Um, well, it was good to meet you, Astor. What are you wearing on your hands? - What? These? - Gets cold in Philadelphia. You didn't want to try boxing hand wraps? Hey, I'm feeling triumphant, Cali. You can try and bring me down. It ain't gonna work. Well, power to you, but can you at least tell me why you insisted that I come to this park at this ridiculous hour? Girls, girls, girls They grow on trees around here. You want to hit on girls while they're exercising in spandex? Yes, I do. Feed me a line. Well, I don't know how happy they're gonna be about you interrupting their workout. - All right, fine. - I already thought of one anyway. - Go on. - Okay. I tell them I'm lost... ask for directions. Brilliant. Genius. Well, go for it, then. I will. See ya. Good luck. - Excuse me. - Hey, um, are you lost? I mean, I'm... I'm lost. Franck? Oh, my God. I can tell you that 50% of girls... and I'm speaking from a large sample size... do not know how to give directions. You... Are a liar. A charming liar, just like everybody else. I'll take charming. Why does everybody lie to me? I suppose they just want to get in your pants. Well, they can have my pants. I don't want to wear my pants anymore. - Whoa! Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. - No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. You can take your pants off. Just, let's... let me take you home first, okay? Come on. Everyone just wants to take me home. - No. No. No. - Well, that's not what I meant. All right, now... hey, hey, hey. Keep your pants on. Put me down! - No, we're going home. - No! I don't want to go home! It's a time-out. Ow! God! - Ow! - Oh. Daddy, what are they doing? Just... All right. You okay? Franck? It's Astor. Hey. My head hurts. Huh. Must... must've been all the, uh, alcohol. Was I really, really embarrassing? No. No. No. No. No. No different than any other child who doesn't want to wear their pants. Do you want to head out again tonight? You sure you're up for it? Ever heard of hair of the dog? Yeah, but... Did something happen with Franck? He went back to Paris. When? Mm. Should be in the air right about now. - He's a dog. - He doesn't deserve you. Let's just stay in tonight. Hair of the dog applies to relationships, too. More like hair of the one-legged dog. I don't get it. One-legged dog? - I get the concept. - What's the joke? - Uh, I don't know. - I'm just being silly. Just trying to cheer you up. Hey. Hey. Hey. Whoa. - Oops. - That was your fault. I'll be in here. So, Cali... Cheers. I said you could buy me a drink, not stay and chat, so... - Serious? - Yeah. Sorry, I'm waiting for someone. Strike one. She liked it when I complimented her dress. In fact, she made her dress. She told me that when I tried to tell her my mom had the same one. Oh. Needless to say, she knew I was pulling a line. And your recovery? - I-I didn't have one. - Yeah, I kind of froze up. Well, next time, try and push past the awkwardness. You know, apparently, people have sex in this pool. - Mm. - Yeah. It's rancid. Like, if you stick your head underwater, you'll get pregnant. Well, who's next? That one. Hi. Can I just say your heels are fantastic. - Louis Vuittons. - Oh. Oh. Of course. No, no, I am familiar with their work. I bet you have a huge collection. I bet you have a huge collection. Oh, I don't wear high heels. I'm not talking about heels. Oh. Oh. Oh, yeah, well, in that case, I have, like...50 pairs. But I bet you've got more. What are you getting at? - High... high heels. - I bet you've got more. I don't know. I... I guess... Well, you're short, so you... The lift, and... you're an asshole. Ow! Ah. Ah. I'm not. I'm no... I'm not, actually. I... She's so much stronger than she looks. Well, you'll get there. Apparently, you're supposed to mix a compliment and an insult, and then they get confused, and then they're determined to get your approval. Apparently? Well, I've only been explained the technique. I haven't actually put it into practice. You're scaring me. Okay, well, look, just stay away from anything personal. Third time's a charm. - Okay. Okay. All right. - Who's the man? Who's the man? - Go. - Who be the player? Yeah. You... you are. You got to test me now I can start just come and hold me take me Aren't you a diamond in the rough? Are you calling my friends rough? - No. No. No, they... - They are a... Lovely pair of... Of friends. Is this guy bothering you, love? He basically just said your sisters were rough. - Did he now? - Is that true? - No. I was talking about... - Uh, no. Um... He's been harassing girls all night. You again? You know, my foot really hurts. And no. I'm just being friendly. Bit of a player, are we? - No. Definitely not. - Absolutely not. In fact, you can ask any... you... ask her. No. - Is my friend Astor drunk again? - Let me take him home. - Wait. - You want to take him home? Yeah. Are you gonna shag him on your sofa? That's not necessary. Oh, yeah? What about this? Hey! Oh, my God! Well, straight to. What are you doing? I got in with you. - It's freezing. - I know. - How's that, mate? - You like that? Jerk! That wasn't necessary, but it was worth it. Why have we to wait so long? People say we're far too young why have we to wait so long? People say we're far too young too young I... I'm sure a lot of amazing guys have been able to meet you with these techniques, but... ...they're not for me. I feel like a phony. - No. - You're definitely an original. - Then why am I learning lines? - No more lines. No more pretending to be someone else. Okay. Um, well, you're good at improvising. We'll work on that. - No. No, I get flustered. - I always say the wrong thing. I-I-I can't think on my feet. Hell, I can't even stand on my feet after that girl stomped on me. No, I'm... I'm not giving up. I'm gonna go forward with honesty. And maybe if a girl gets to know me, she'll still dump me like Mila, but... I'm too tired to be someone else. I'm sure there's someone out there for you. We've been having fun together. Yeah. You're heartbroken over Mila. It's tattooed all over your face. I like you. But you love Mila. No, I think, um, I think you should go with being yourself. It'll work. I hope so. Should get out of those damp clothes. Slip into something more comfortable? I'll see you soon. Can I sit here? You look like the kind of girl I'd like to know, and if you let me sit here for a minute, I might be able to find out. Okay. I'm... I'll... Uh, hello. - Did you... - Did you say something? Hello. Well, hi. Pleased to meet you. Yeah. Yeah. Me... S-so, you've lost your voice? No. I, um, this is my voice. Oh. It's kind of cute. Thanks. A hawk. Red-tailed hawk. Genus Buteo. Species Jamaicensis. That's right. She sounds perfect. I dumped her last night. What? Why? She bored me to tears. You actually cried, didn't you? I've never had to break up with anyone. It's kind of difficult. I sent a 194-character message. That's two SMS messages. But I think if you do that, people think you're making an effort. Well, I never thought I'd say it, Astor, but you're heartless. That'd be nice. A heart does not beat on blood alone. I wish I could rip my heart out and be done with it. Surely, there are other blood-filled organs that can pump blood around the body. I don't know how you can say that when you just crushed a heart last night. I cried for her, and I cried for me. Yeah, but you loved it. You think I'm indulging? You ever get bored when you're sad? - No. - So admit it. - You find sadness entertaining. - I'm human. All I'm saying is that emotions are addictive, good or bad. - Oh, great. - I'm an addict. You recommend cold Turkey or weaning? Um, maybe desensitizing. Ow! Come on, man! Ah! How'd you mean it, then? Hmm? I hope he makes you happy. I meant it as I said it. I wasn't being sarcastic. Sounds sarcastic to me. I would never use such a low form of wit. - You're using it now. - He's using it now, isn't he? - Hey! Hey! - I respect you too much for that. You sarcastic bastard! Stop playing games, Astor. Okay. Okay. From the bottom of my heart, I'm sorry I headbutted you with my eye socket. God, I could not hate you more. - Now who's being sarcastic? - You butthead! - You love me, don't you? - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - Okay. All right. Hey! - Settle down. And you. What are you doing? I'm sorry I called you easy. You're definitely not easy. I was hurt, and it made me nasty. - He uses sarcasm. - Just... you drive. Hey. I'll try not to get my finger stuck in your ring this time. What? - Your key ring. - Your little... I'm sorry. That... that did not come out right... At all. I'm sorry. How's your apartment coming along? Do you spy on all of your neighbors, or... Only the cute ones. Let's hope I'm not included in that. Not anymore. Hi. You didn't have to bring these back. - They're not my size. - Yeah. Um, you should go. Jake's inside. You should really talk to Cali again. - Why? She's still angry at me. - She's not gonna forgive me. What's the point of talking to her? I can be there. You know, you should just go, Astor. Okay. Oh, hi. Yeah. What's this? It's just... okay. You had this? Well, she left it at my place by the bed... under it, really. It was weeks ago, Jake. The idea that Mila dropped her drawers in front of you makes me want to upchuck in my mouth. - Go right ahead. - Just get out of the way. - Jake. Jake! Jake! Jake! - Hey, stop! Jake! He's strangling me! Stop! Astor. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. Jake? Jake? - What did you do to him? - What did you do? Jake? It's a myocardial infarction. - A heart attack? - He's only 28 years old. No, he's got to go to the hospital. - I'm okay! - He's okay. - Oh! - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - Baby. Baby. - Do you have insurance? - I'm okay. I'm okay. - Are you sure? Chest pains, dysemia, high-stress individual, probable steroid usage. - A textbook scenario. - Get him out of here! He needs to see a doctor. - We're doctors. - We can handle this. You're med students, and your grades aren't that good. Just leave, Astor. - Okay. We're gonna be okay. - Okay? Just... yeah. - You ready? - Left here? - Yes. - Left here? - Yes, right here... left. I can't believe there's a hospital around here. It's a very residential neighborhood. Oh, my God, I'm stuck behind a grandmother. Move! Get out of the way! - He's barely even breathing. - Could you just hurry up? Do you even know where you're going, Astor? - No. Not... not really. - What?! - I mean, I have an idea. - I have a general idea. - Give me your phone. - Okay. Okay. Okay. - Just take the phone. - He's really not good. - Take the phone. Look it up. - What? Look up where the hospital is. You probably should've sat up front. Three Miles ahead. It should be on your right-hand side. Are you sure that's the closest? - That's all we ha... - Where do you want to go? Just a free clinic? God, this guy is just riding me. Put your brakes on if he's riding you. Make him crash into you. I hate people who do that. Well, we have somewhere to be. Oh. Already? Yeah. - Are you kidding me? - Yeah. You okay? Yeah. Blood flow's back to normal. I...Might be ready to go again in a couple minutes. Have you said thank you to Astor yet? I will. I'm just not looking forward to it. Well, he probably saved your life, so... I know. I know. He's just gonna be so smug. Why are you so happy with yourself? Do I need a reason? Mm. You could've let Milas boyfriend die. Then at least she'd be available. It was a toss up. Impress her by being the hero or let the opposition annihilate himself. Yeah. You probably made the right choice. Did you set this up? I want you to be friends again. Astor. Just give it a shot, okay? Can we just try, Cali? I guess. Thank you. Let's all just promise that we're gonna be mature about this, okay? So... You walked in on Mila with William James, is that right? Not exactly. So, you didn't see them together, but you knew that they'd been together. No. I was there. Oh, you were hiding? No. William James and I invited Mila to join us. Where? I mean, I don't... In your bed? Like a... like a... A... Mnage trois? - Like a three... - I'm really sorry. I wish it'd never happened. I guess it wasn't really cheating, but it was enough to end it. Three years with one guy. I actually thought I loved him. How... Okay, I think... I think it's important that we understand how this happened. How did W.J. Instigate this? Well, he knew Mila and I were close. He asked me if I'd ever been with a woman, if I'd ever thought about it, if Mila and I had ever kissed, and it grew from there. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I just wanted to make him happy. - Oh, you probably did... - I'm guessing. I don't... I'm gue... you know. I-I thought it was something you both wanted. I obviously made a huge mistake, and I'm sorry. Me, too. But how did it work? Uh... I mean, I-I-I-I've had a... Mnage un. - A lot... a lot of the time. - A lot of times. But a mnage trois? Just more people. Hey, I thought maybe it was time for that drink. - Yeah. - Yeah? Come on in. Yeah. Thanks. This is a really nice place. Oh, thank you. Yes, uh, make yourself at home. Sure. So, uh, do you have any lemons for the... Uh, no. No, I'm sorry. Straight. It's how I do it. Cheers. Ah. Just... Hello? You don't need my advice. - Uh, yes. - I'd like to order a half-dozen. Astor, if she's there with you, it means she likes you. Okay, how do I go about getting more of the rump steaks? - Put some music on. - Get her dancing. All right. I'll try those. Bye. That was my, uh... Mail-order meat woman. I like regular meat. Always there. Protein's good. Yeah. - Let's put on some music. - Yes. You want to put on some music? Mm-hmm. Normally, I dance by myself. Come on, Astor. Get up. - You mind? - I think my head's bleeding. Let me see. I think it's bleeding. Yeah. Okay. Here. All right. All right. Oh, I don't see anything. So, I guess... Oh. - All right, it's okay. - Oh, yeah. I got it. I got it. I got it. No. No. No. No. It's making it... making it worse. Here, let me just... Voil. What? "You could get any girl you want." She said that? This your meat lady? I can't believe she said that. I have to go. I'm sorry. Can you let yourself out? Hello? How do I let her know that I'm really into her? She'll be able to tell. - I don't think she does. - I'm gonna tell her. Are you sure you're not gonna scare her off? I mean, does she know who you really are... your birding, your loud mouth, your silliness? I mean, I love all that, but it does take some getting used to. She accepts me for who I am. Well, if you feel it, you can tell her. Set my silly little heart on fire became my desire you stood me up What are you... Do you think I'm the only girl that likes you? - What do you mean? - I just rejected a girl. Oh, so you're feeling confident, or you want to make Mila jealous. Am I not successful enough with women for you, too? Is that it? No, you're a romantic. You want to find the one, and... Watch movies together when it's raining, make breakfast for each other on Sunday mornings. It's just, that's not me. It's not what I want. You stood me up you stood me up Hi. I'm sorry about before. Mm-hmm. Oh! - Oh, um, I'm sorry. - Did I do something wrong? I did. No, but your hairy tongue did, so... Should I go and shave it? No, just cut it off, maybe. And send it to you in the mail. - Or just swallow it. - Either way. Uh... Enjoy. Mila said you really like birds, so I brought you here. I appreciate it. Would've paid extra for the Turkey if you wanted. Poultry's poultry. Turkey seems a little bit more festive. Did you have a cerebral aneurysm associated with your arrhythmia? Huh? A period where your brain goes without blood. How would I know that? There's a test they do. Oh, then, uh, definitely don't have that 'cause they didn't do the test. That's good. So, um, thank you for taking me to the hospital, and I'm sorry that I was a butthead. That's okay. You're not... You're not gonna say that I wasn't a butthead? You were a little bit of a butthead. - No. No, I was not. - Okay. No. Man, you really don't know when to back down, do you? - And you do? - Yeah. What about now. Uh, is now the time to back down? For me or for you? I just... Neither, man. Boom! Out this way. You have anything other than chicken? Oh. - Astor. - Ah! What? Hey. - And you are twins. - Yeah. Yeah. Uh, trinity, divinity. Trinity and divinity. I suppose you have a sister named naivete, too. Or that's just me. - We're twins, not triplets. - Right. Okay. So, it was you that I was presumptive with. Yeah. Trinity told me that she didn't know anyone here. Yeah, I was kind of keeping you a secret, too. I just thought you were creepy. Sadly, I have that effect on women. Well, I think you're pretty charming. - Oh. Well. - And I was, um... I don't know if you wanted to have dinner tonight or something? Yeah. Yes. Great. Let's all three have dinner. Yeah. Sure. Can I ask you guys a silly question? - Sure. - Sure. Have you two ever kissed? She was born a Cali girl the sun and surf, it was her world till mom and dad had split apart a broken home, a broken heart and then she walked into my life I swore one day she'd be my wife and I'm not sure if I was wrong and that is why I wrote this song about the girl I met one day who took my heart and went away and left me there to dream again of all the things she ever meant of battleships and butterflies and all the tears we ever cried and hours and hours of sunny smiles Oh, God. Okay. - Hey. - Hey. Hi. Uh, yeah, uh... Jake and I broke up. How did he take it? Well, he didn't have a heart attack. It was... it was really wonderful what you did for him. Oh, well, I had to put all that studying to some sort of use. He's really appreciative, and... Yeah. Yeah. He bought me that chicken dinner. Can I just come in? Can... Can we talk tomorrow? Are you okay? - I'm... Naked. - Yeah. - But otherwise, I'm good. - Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Let's just... let's just catch up tomorrow. Okay. Hi. Who are you? Who am I? Who are you? Who's she? Ah. Who are they? Trinity and divinity. Right? Yeah. Okay, guys. Here, let's... - Bye-bye. - Bye. - Ah! - You all right? Bye. - Mila, please. - What? - Let's talk. - Your twins are waiting. They don't matter to me. And that's why you're a slut. - Those girls and I just kissed. - That's it. Do you know how many girls I've ever slept with? With or without significantly different DNA? One is the answer. Just you. You were my first, and you didn't even care. - That's not fair. - You suffocated me. I felt like a kitten in a plastic bag. We had no chance. But if you come home with me now, we can start again. Did you break up with Jake, or did he break up with you? Why does that matter? You only want me now because other girls want me. Then go sleep with those other girls. I might. I'm single. That's a pretty big opportunity for me. I'm offering you a second chance. The timing is not ideal. You sleep with those clones, and we might not even be friends. Come on in. Water's fine. I bet it is. Don't be shy. Cali. Oh. It's too late, Franck. What about your girlfriend in Paris? Fini. I don't believe you. You never called, and when you left, you said you weren't coming back. I was taken by surprise. I had to see you again. Right. Well, you're a phony, just like the rest of them. You're half a man. Like your friend, uh, Astor. He's more of a man than you'll ever be. In fact, he's about the only real guy I know. - What about George Clooney? - He's a real guy. Later, Franck. Cali, I'm birding. You want to join? Hi. It's so great to be birding again. I think I'm a convert. - Hi. - Hi. Isn't this a funny thing to do? - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Have a look in that tree. A great horned owl. Isn't he majestic? - Yeah. I love it. Yeah. Here. It's beautiful. You're beautiful. They all kind of look the same to me. Not for me. Birding's my passion, like medicine is for you. I can't wait to be a doctor, to be taken seriously for a change. It won't be Mila or miss Klein. It'll be, "yes, Dr. Klein. Would you like a free upgrade, Dr. Klein?" Yes, I would, thank you. "Is there a doctor in the house?" That'll be scary. I don't know what I'd do if that happened. Wouldn't it be your duty? I'm not gonna give mouth-to-mouth to some dirty homeless guy. I guess that's beyond the call. You're not gonna spend the whole night flirting, are you? - Of course not. - Just that Cali's told me that you've kissed a lot of girls recently. Cali told you that? Is it true? Excuse... Busy bee. Uh... I kissed a couple. I mean, two separate people. Not a guy and a girl, like... Did she tell you that before we got back together? - I don't know. - Does it matter? Oh, by the way. You should probably have a little more practice before you dance in public. Boop. Shall I enroll in some samba classes? Hey. Jenny! Astor! Hey. Sorry. You look awesome. Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Come here. Come on. Come on. Mila! Dry the tears you've shed shed in the name of love Whoo. Oh, my God. Look at this place. - Astor, stop. - Just... stop. Stop. We should break up. What? I don't make you happy. Not everyone is happy-go-lucky all the time, Astor. - You should be. - Why? The world is not made up of singing birds and dancing. I wish my mom would write "happy birthday" on my cake in jam. I've never seen you eat cake. I don't eat cake. I'm a pretty face. That's my value. You're not just a pretty face. You got a good body, too. Right. So, you've loved me since we were kids because I was the prettiest girl you knew? I thought you had some heart, that maybe you love me for other reasons, that you would lift me above that. You've always been my girl, but... But what? I... We're no... we're... You're actually breaking up with me. That's okay. I'm gonna find happiness on my own. Besides, it's obvious that you like Cali. Oh, come on. I mean, I saw the way her eyes lit up when we were birding. You guys have been running around chasing girls, trying to get you laid. You think women want to be played, that we want to be seduced by technique? You think you understand women because you've had a threesome? I didn't sleep with them. It's awkward when you can't tell the difference between two girls. Do you honestly think Cali's gonna want you when you're so desperately trying to be a male slut? - Don't use that word. - It discourages free behavior. Male? I thought that was the one word that meant you could do whatever you want and no consequences. Actually, I meant "slut." It's a dirty word for "liberated." I'm gonna tell you one more thing. Girls want a guy that's nice, sure. They also want a man. Your sweetness is charming, Astor. But it's not always gonna be enough. Sorry for being sweet. No, what? No. Just... could you go? You say that we're different I feel the same sunshine and rain make a beautiful thing my strength is your weakness my heart is own your voice breaks my silence then we're alone sunshine and rain Hey. Hi. I'm trinity. This is my sister, divinity. Boo. Hi. It's good to see you. It's going. Come and sit down. Hey it's happened again no hey I cannot leave you know hey forget how to breathe again hey I cannot just leave again I love your eyes and your smile so won't you please invite me to stay for a while? 'cause the ride home's long and the birds will sing a song if we spent this moment together watch the sun rise up together again mm So, you, uh, broke up with Mila. Thought you loved her. I love her like a sister. Well, it's a good thing you stopped sleeping with her, then. Been on any other dates? I'm taking a break from all that. Well, it's a numbers game, Astor. You look phased again. No. I'm just cruising along. Take it or leave it. Take me or leave me. Like an old couch on the sidewalk. Some of those couches are pretty comfy. - And who are you chasing? - Franck? No. I opened my eyes. You sure about that? Are you trying to hit on me again? I'm not playing games. I told you I liked you, and I meant it. - Yeah, I get it. - No, you don't. We had fun together, Cali. Running around chasing girls? We have fun no matter what we do. - Are we having fun now? - Yes. We would be if you would just let me in. You make me so happy, Cali. And... and... and if you let go for one second, you'd see that I make you happy, too. Isn't that why you tease me all the time? I don't see how anyone could resist making fun of you. I'm yours if you want me, Cali. We might just fall in love. Yeah. And you might just break my heart. Could you love me that much that that would be possible? Maybe. That would be wonderful. Oh, my God. Hey. Hey! Come back here! Whoo! Whoa! Whoo! Oh, my God.
