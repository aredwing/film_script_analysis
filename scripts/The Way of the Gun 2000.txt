Listen to me! Get off the fucking car with your fucking ass! Shut that cunt 's mouth, or I'll come over and fuck-start her head! Do something. Go. You're gonna wish you never got up this morning, asshole... because my boyfriend's gonna fuck you up. And then after that... while he's fucking up your gay uncle, I'll cut off your cock... and mail it to your mother, your fucking faggot bitch! Gaylord fucking bitch! How do you like that? A lot? Fucking faggot! You like to ass-fuck? Want a fucking head-fuck? You like to fuck baby heads? You like to fuck boys? He'll fuck you in the ass! He's not even gay, but he'll do it just.... Honey. Honey. She's got a big mouth, but she's not kidding. I'm gonna whip you silly. You want to do the man-dance? First dance's yours. Why would you pick a fight with them? Why?! Look at me! -Look at my fucking face! -You're more beautiful than ever! I'll call myself Mr. Parker. My associate will be Mr. Longbaugh. There is a natural order, the way things are meant to be. The order says the good guys always win,you die when it's your time... or you have it coming, and the ending is always happy... if only for someone else. Our path had been chosen and we had nothing to offer the world... our options narrowing down to petty crime or minimum wage. So we stepped off the path... and went looking for the fortune that we knew was looking for us. Once off the path,you do what you can to eat, to keep moving. You don't blow your chance with nickel-and-dime. No comforts. Need is the ultimate monkey. A pint of your blood can fetch you 50 bucks. A shot of cum,3 grand. You keep your life simple, and you can literally self-sustain. -What qualifies you as a donor? -I'd say I'm a fairly intelligent... good-looking man, physically fit, stable. Thank you, mister. Heterosexual? -Can I ask you something? -Sure. Are you a faggot? See, you asked me if I was heterosexual. I asked you the same, only I was clear about the answer I wanted. -I asked if you were heterosexual. -I've never killed a man. -I beg your pardon? -I said I've never killed a man. -I didn't ask you if you had. -You asked why I was qualified. I wonder why that strikes you as important for semen donation. It 's a big fucking.... Excuse me, a very important qualification. -No one's ever said that before. -Have you ever asked? -No. -You should. Take Los Angeles, okay? If I say that Los Angeles has become... a Mecca for homosexual migration, I'm right. But look at what I said. I make it sound like faggots are miscreants who need to move around. I'm also likening them to Muslims, or Muslims to them. -"LA's full of faggots" is honest. -Why is that a big deal? -Nobody brings up necrophilia! -Of course they don't. It 's sick. -You brought it up. I didn't ask. -You should. "Faggot." Just say it. -I can't say that. -Funny. If I grab a woman's ass... and she punches me, she's fighting for her rights. But if a faggot grabs my ass and I punch him, I'm a homophobe. -Let 's just move on. -Are... you... a faggot? Any trace of mental illness in the family? It 's not what you say anymore, is it? It 's all in how you say it. Yeah, can you hold on just a sec? Where were we? Okay, listen. Let 's pretend you don't smoke and and overlook the coke breakfasts. Let 's imagine you get your life together and get up before noon. Steff, please! You're still not cut out to be a surrogate mother. Look, there's a girl comes in here, due any day, getting paid a million. Sounds like a lot? Wrong. She comes in for treatment three times before the damn embryo takes. Turns out the couple is perfectly healthy. I guess the wife just couldn't be bothered to carry her own child. They tell the girl what to eat, when to go out, bodyguards watch her. Of course it 's fishy. It 's what I'm saying. She's gotta live with them. Poor girl's like a prisoner. It 's just not worth it. Look, if that 's what you feel, then go with God! I don't know! Why do you call and ask, if you're not gonna listen? Just call the doctor, maybe he could help you. No, he's in the book. His name's Painter. Allen Painter. And here was the thing: some deep pockets,a pregnant woman... some bodyguards and a doctor's name. The longest distance between two points is a kidnapper and his money. But we were through jerking off. Feel that, hon? It 's fantastic. Yes. It 's fabulous, Hale. She doesn't hate you, Robin. She most certainly does, Mr. Chidduck. -You're worried about the baby. -No, it 's... Come on. A woman needs security like a man needs approval. She wants her past, present and future to all be secure. Right now. And in a few days, this baby will be a part of your past. And for you to leave and not know it 's secure.... I would never ask you to trust me. It 's the cry of a guilty soul. But trust life. Always trust life. If you're careful enough to listen, life does take care. You're gonna be a good father. She's gonna be a good mother. You'll see. As soon as she lays eyes on him, nature will take over. I know it. I hope to God you're right, Robin. Because if this baby doesn't change.... "Him"? You didn't want to know. I'm sorry, I.... -You did say "him". -"Him". I have to go to the appointment now with Dr. Painter. I'm going to have a son. I'm going to have a son. -So I didn't spoil it, then? -No, you didn't spoil it. Right? Right. Come on! Every goddamn time. -Four to One. -Go ahead. One. I'm sure it 's nothing, but could you just drive by the building? -How's your back feeling? -It 's better. Yes, it 's better. Down here? Bet you can't wait for this little guy to get out. Actually, I don't mind if it stays in there forever. So, unless there are complications, I won't see you until the 15th. The video I told you about. Things you should know about your delivery. Thanks. We want this to go down nice and quiet, so put the guns down. -Guys, we got you. It 's over. What? -The people, man. The people. Can't you people see there are guns here? Get the fuck out! Get out! Come on, this is no good. Put the guns down. I'll count to three.... What the fuck are you doing? You're supposed to be protecting her! -Fuck. What 'd I tell you? -Walk away. Just walk away. They don't care about dying, just losing! You won't make it out of here alive, you know the cops are gonna come! Just walk away! Move! Move, yes! Relax, relax. Moving. -I got her. -Okay. -Moving. -Move. -Moving? -No. -Moving? -Move. -Get her. -Move. It 's okay. Move! Four to One. They made a pass. They're coming out. Do not.... Take the girl. Do not go to the doctor's office. Go to the top floor and wait for me for as long as it takes. Do you understand me? Do you? -Yes! -Go. Wait for me. Right this way! Do you care about this baby? Then you walk. Cover! Move! Are you okay? Miss? The baby is kicking. The guns and noise... the baby is kicking like crazy. Please! Relax! Could you be easy, please? -You can open your eyes now. -I don't want to look at you. It doesn't matter. All right. -Follow me, Tonto. -All right, give them room. -What 's your name? -Robin. -And the father? -You had it all figured out, huh? Listen, the sooner you tell us who the money is, the sooner.... The sooner I end up dead. I know that as long as I'm carrying this baby... and you two don't have the money, I'm alive. We're not talking about how long you'll live, but how slow you'll die. What do you call your baby? -It 's not mine. -Like that matters. He have to have a name. What do you think when you think about deaf people... people who are born deaf, who never heard a spoken word? What do they call the son, their mother or their own reflection in the mirror? That 's what I call it. There's no name. I'm not gonna name it. For what? -Help. -Shit. Dr. Painter, this is Colleen at your message service. I've got an emergency call from Robin. -It's hard to say it,but I can't. -You said you'd tell me anything. It's not illegal,is it? No,Daddy. That was a stupid thing to ask. -He's a doctor. He'll obey us. -I need help! -You have too much faith in people. -How to kidnap somebody without it? Let 's fake it. Would you get me Mr. Chidduck? Hi, Robin. Look at me. -Talk to me. How do you feel? -I'm dizzy. I'm not gonna make it. -You're gonna make it. -Am I gonna have it? -How long since you drank water? -I don't know. You do what I say, you understand me? You do what I say! If anything happens to me, if this all goes terribly wrong... It already has gone terribly wrong. I'm sorry. Just get me a fucking figure. What kind of a kidnapping is this? Aren't we in the demands phase at this point? -You can't pay,Hale. -Certainly I can. It's not about the money, the life of the girl,even the child. They get caught crossing the border,running a red light... that money is coming right back to you. You'll have to account for it, explain. Understand what I said? You cannot pay. Joe, can't you just go over and... whatever, you know... rub them out? No,no. If we call the police, surround them,sweat them out... they only have their lives. We don't have to negotiate. They do. Robin is their only chip. They have to give her up. It's that simple. You keep your money, the girl, and nobody looks at your books. I can't. No! No police! Just, you know... hell, figure it out! She's dehydrated. The pain can feel very much like labor. -But she won't lose the baby. -No. -But she'll have it within 6 days. -Don't lie to me, Doc. I'm not gonna lie. I'm concerned for the health of my patient. The baby is over eight pounds and should come out by the 15th. Don't push us, man. -Can't she have it sooner? -You mean, induce? -Here? Absolutely not. -Don't hand me that, Doc. -First baby was born in a cave. -Because it had to be. -What if he had to? -Yeah. -As for baby and mother surviving.... -Forget that. Who are the parents? You guys don't.... -Who are the parents? -Francesca and Hale Chidduck. Oil and steel Chidducks, Vegas union-busters Chidducks? -You guys have never...? -It 's not our crowd. He's a front man for developers who cut in on rough territory. Sometimes he launders money out of Mexico. He's fucking crazy. Makes his living collecting other people's enemies, shooting them. This is their worst nightmare, and you don't know who you grabbed? How much money this guy have? -I have no idea. -Will he deal? Anything to keep it quiet. Abner? -Joe! -You busy? No, not at all. -You drunk? -A little. What can I do for you? I need you to stay with somebody. She needs medical supervision. -She's not well. Let me stay. -Don't get smart with me, Doc. Superman never gets the girl. -What 's this? -It 's the ransom note. Just sit tight with this Chidduck guy. We'll be in touch. You're gonna be the bagman. You'll meet me in Mexico with the money. She'll be with my partner. You and I won't know where until he calls. You'll come alone and you'll come equipped to induce labor. Not, she dies. You're followed, she dies. If I don't answer the phone when my partner calls, she dies. It 's on your head now. The more careful you are, the less I worry. -Got me? That baby's coming out. -I understand. Right. You got a number for this thing? Don't say "Who? Me? He? She?" You got a number? We'll call you when we're ready. Go. Are you going to eat that other half of your sandwich? -I was, but... are you hungry? -Yes. I'm pregnant. -I like bacon. -It 's from a gas station. It 's still good. Thanks. The shooting began after they kidnapped an unidentified woman. Thanks, Jack. -Which one of you is Jeffers? -Who are you? Of course. I'm Joe Sarno. Mr. Chidduck sent me. -When can we...? -We're working on your release now. The police are not ready to charge you, but... they are a bit upset that no one will tell them what 's going on. -Are you a lawyer? -Do I look like a fucking lawyer? I handle Mr. Chidduck's laundry. Things like you. I make unpleasant decisions for him... of which he can and never will know. And he sleeps very well. You're a bagman. Let 's just say I deal in the fine art of adjudication. Now... Obecks, is it? What did you tell the cops? Cop want to know why there was two dead bodyguards and nobody to guard. I told him we took the client out, the client 's name was confidential. He asked who took the client out, I told him that was confidential. He said the client was a witness. I said no, it was before the shooting. He said I had all the answers. I said, yes, because it 's the truth. Was there a time when one of the deceased could've been in touch...? -Wait. You don't think...? -No, I don't think. Nor do I assume, speculate or hypothesize. I merely observe. And what I observe... is one frantic fuck-up on what should be a routine exec protect. Two yahoos wipe out half his staff coming out of a building... in broad daylight, empty-handed, empty-handed. -How can this happen, I ask? -She was running. -Unlikely. -She took that kid for herself. I had her in the box. You think a woman with a baby in her belly... is going to walk into a hail of pistol fire for some fresh air? -For weeks she acted hinky. -She's out of our sight a minute... in nine months, and she goes for the door. She was.... -You picked her to be the host. -So naturally it 's our fault, right? -Fuck me. -Well... I am, to say the least, perplexed as well as frustrated. It is Mr. Chidduck's wish that you two idiots remain in this employ. He speaks very highly of you. He feels you will be extremely motivated in resolving this matter. Despite my urging him to fire your ass and have you fed to the fish. Beyond this, the matter's been left to my discretion. The aforementioned art of adjudication. Precisely, Mr. Jeffers. To wit, should another macabre spectacle... like the one that presented itself this afternoon take place... you will be cut loose... and then, Mr. Jeffers, I will have my druthers. I promise a day of reckoning that you'll not live enough to forget. -There's a thing you need to learn. -What 's that? The only thing you can assume about a broken-down old man... is that he's a survivor. Jack. -You really think she was running? -It doesn't matter. The way I see it, she crossed over when she got off the elevator. If Mr. Chidduck wants us to resolve this, we will, but from now on... our only concern is with the child. The girl is a threat like the two men. The subscriber is unavailable or outside the coverage area. -Shouldn't we be there with him? -He's fine. -Aren't you guys a team? -He'll be fine. -What if he doesn't come back? -He always comes back. -The subscriber is unavailable.... -Fuck me! -Are you sure she's all right? -I think so. And the baby? As far as I can tell, it 's fine. -And they had no idea? -None. None until I told them. And I'm sure you didn't mention your relationship. -Fuck you, Francesca! What was I...? -Easy. Easy! Easy. What good would that have done? -You did the right thing. -Didn't lose his place at the table. Francesca. Allen. Allen. I didn't ask to come back here. You asked me. I will not have her, of all people, telling me what is.... For God's sake! She's not herself. More today than most, I'd say. If Mom could see that cunt.... Are you going to pay? I'm going to the police. You're here out of a basic need. You needed money from me. I needed discretion from you! Loyalty! Obedience! You are here, frankly, because after what happened in Baltimore... you were for sale! And you will do as you are told! -What about Robin? -What about her? -The woman needs to be reassessed. -What does that mean? -She ran, Doc. -She panicked. -What happened to your eye? -Where's Sarno? Sarno came and went. We thought he'd be with you. Hold there just a bit. Sit down. Move your fucking hand. Hello? -Are you the client? -I am the client. Tell the doctor to get to Highway 19 South, across the border. He'll come to a town, Salsipuedes. He'll find the Nacio Madre Motel. Across from it there's a payphone where he'll wait. He comes ready to induce labor and leave with the baby. We let the girl go when we feel safe. He comes alone. He brings 15 million dollars. 15 million dollars? We're going to need some time to get that. Give me 24 hours. -You got 12. -Goddamit! 12 fucking hours! Jesus Christ! How do you expect me to.... Okay. All right, fine. 12 hours. Jesus! Is that it? Yeah, small, unmarked bills. You know how much that weighs? Try a couple thousand pounds! All right, fine. Hundreds. -Is that it? -What do you think? -It has holes. -Well, we're new at this. You're not gonna make it, kid. One's bad fire. Three's gunplay. Step out. Put it down. A cop'll come by, blow your head off. Hands on your chest. -Who are you? -Well, son... right now, I'm the button man. I'm the guy you'll wake up to, one night, maybe a year from now... maybe two. And all you'll see is a pillow over your face, then you'll hear a pop. Plenty more where I came from. Yeah, I used to be one. -What 's happening? -Looks like a bagman. -He'll make an offer. Small. -You should take it, maybe. No, you can't trust a bagman. Always double-cross you. Tell you what I'm willing to do. I'll take you to the man right now. He'll hand you a million, you wait while your partner sends the girl. -When she gets there, you'll go. -Sounds shaky. It 's better than the alternative, I can promise you that. You want to wait here? Look what happened when you stopped for gas. We just want to do this clean and quiet. Take the girl, the baby back. I'll buy you a cup of coffee. Can we have a couple of cups of coffee, please? So, are you the brains of the outfit, or is he? Tell you the truth, I don't think this is a brains kind of operation. Do you think I agreed to help you because of Baltimore? I know that before Baltimore you hadn't.... I honestly hoped that if you eased back into delivery, just.... Don't be an idiot. No one incident makes anyone what they are. Baltimore simply taught me who I am. As for what I am... I learned all about the value of human life from you. That certainty is more important than morality. -Abortion is more certain than...? -Exactly. I don't make mistakes. I correct them. So I empathize with you, Dad. I really do. Francesca. Fascinating, isn't it? I had no idea. -It 's really got me excited. -Excited, huh? I missed you. They'll kill us. The people I'm in business with. The money I have leads back to them. We pay, they kill us. -Any police, they kill us. -It 's your bed to lie in, not mine. You're my son. I love you. And it 's your bed too. That 's the sort of people they are. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I've gotten you involved in this part of my life. I know it isn't your thinking, and I'm grateful for that. I never wanted you to be that way. But don't be nave. She understood who she was dealing with. She understood the situation. It 's a simple fact of life... that anyone who would do business with a man like me can't be trusted. I'm a mother. My child is waiting to come into this world. And suddenly, for the first time, I feel like... that he deserves me. I don't mean that I've earned him as a mother that 's carried has... but I worked hard to become the kind of woman who could have one... naturally, with you. -You know the baby is, don't you? -Of course I do. You know we have to go get him. I understand. If the girl should die... God forbid anything should happen, but if there's any complications... we'll take care of it, understand? You just bring me back my baby. I watch them pile up. Nightstick, flashlight, bulletproof vest. Fucking utility belts, right? Fucking sign on his head reading: "Why bother?" -They say shit like "ascertain". -"Surveillance". -"Affirmative". -"I need backup." "Adjudicate". -"Adjudicate"? -Yeah. But, you know, you got the other side. Trigger-happy cocksuckers all about the shooting and the posturing. -"You don't know me, I did time." -Because you got caught, dumbfuck. These days, they want to be criminals more than commit crimes. That 's not just crime, that 's the way of the world. What? I'm just talking here. By their design, all we only need to come back with is the baby. Think about it. No money, no perps, no nothing. We could kill these two fucks, keep the money, bring Chidduck's baby... and say it all went well. Well, mostly well. What, the girl? It 'll be assumed she ate a bullet and they made off to Bolivia. Dammit. It doesn't work. The Doc. -The Doctor gets shot in the fray. -Right. We tried to help him, but it was either him or the baby. He was alive when we took off. He must have died in the desert. -Creative articulation, my man. -I'm just talking, of course. Sure. So, what we need is a nice, quiet place to have a baby. As I said before, my only concern is for the child. Hola, Vivian. This is Jeffers. I need to speak to the Question Mark. We might be needing a room later on tonight. You know... you seem like a good guy. You ought to get out of this fucking business. What would I do, then? You get to be my age, you start feeling a little different. You realize one day you'll zig. All that time, you're thinking... you'll put something away tomorrow, then one day you're out of lives. Do you got some money put away? I've got a daughter. She's... she's putting something together, says she'll take care of me, but.... Not working out? Something like that. Yeah, something like that. You're sure you don't want to take a ride with me? Million in cash? I wish I could, but.... -I'm a bagman. -You are a bagman. Until that day, then. What do you think? We can get her out of there right now. Just two, right? Please, I have to take a ride back. Don't do a thing without me. -No matter what. -Jesus Christ, she's.... All right? I'm counting on you to remain pitiless here. Help me out. Just stay with her and let it play out. I'll be back. -Wait a minute, what 's so funny? -You're cheating! No, I'm not cheating, all right? What? -What are we playing? -Hearts. How do you play? The object is to play the safest game and finish with less points. A heart is the only thing of value. If you have one... get rid of it. We start with the two of clubs. You need to throw down a club. If I don't have one, then you can throw a heart. You can't lead with a heart unless you have nothing else to throw. Or someone breaks the suit. You follow? Couple of rounds and she'll get it. See, you had the high card, so you take the trick. Now you lead. First trick always takes the odd card. Shit. You got the bitch. She's 13 points. Fuck the bitch. Just get rid of your hearts. Or shoot the moon. That 's when you finish with everything. You got the hearts and the queen of spades. Everyone else loses. Next to impossible. If someone figures it out, they can sacrifice and hold onto a heart. And then you lose. Is that so? I needed the money. It 's a million dollars cash, and I needed it for.... That 's what it was about! I told myself that the Chidducks, they'd be good, you know? And that the baby would have a good life. I thought it through a thousand times! I thought I could do it! I was certain, and it was... it was what was best for everyone involved. For the baby, for the Chidducks, for myself... the baby.... Then I felt it move, and... I saw his little hands. The baby is mine. Okay, I'm sorry, but by yours, do you mean that...? I mean that the Chidduck's embryo didn't take... and this is my son that I'm carrying. So that means that you and Mr. Chidduck.... Dr. Painter. -That sneaky little quack. -It wasn't his idea, it was mine. I made it happen because I needed the money. I made it happen. Listen, you don't want guys like him or me touching you belly. Please. That 's creepy. We'll meet just right past the border. Listen, I appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Did you enjoy your coffee? I deal in counter-offers and adjudication. You do your job, Mr. Bullet-Catcher, and I'll do mine. I'm curious as to why they didn't kill you. Maybe I didn't present a real threat. Not like you fuckheads, shooting at who agreed not to commit a crime. All right, come on. -The money coming? -In a while. Then I suggest Dr. Painter goes in now with 5O grand. Might calm their nerves if they feel the real money's getting close. When you go out, I'll go in. -And adjudicate? -If it comes to that, yes. -You go in by yourself? -I think I can handle it. And you, cuff links... stay and watch over Mr. Chidduck in case there's a contingent. -In case there's a what? -A third man. A button. Something, anything that we hadn't thought of. It 's called CYA, you fucking moron. "Cover Your Ass". As collector of pre-war cop jargon, I find the old man refreshing. Nevertheless, he's one against two who killed two of my four. I suggest you let him C your A. What seems to be the problem here? The decision's been made. The Doc goes in with the money alone. He follows the demands to the letter and delivers the child. -We keep our distance. -Unless there's a complication. Our only concern is for the lives at stake. -Hale, you're not seriously...? -I'm in a tight corner, Joe. It 's pure geometry, Mr. Sarno. We've been head-to-head with them. One old man all alone out there... no one'll come out alive. To be honest, Joe, that 's not what this is about. You're conflicted here. Your job's been to protect me, my associates and my money. But I no longer care about any of that. This is about my child. And that in itself presents its own special conflict, doesn't it? Emotional detachment, Joe. For what it 's worth... I think these two pretty much define it. Are you up to this? -I'll do whatever has to be done. -All right. Jeffers and Obecks will follow you... and see that you come out safely with the baby. Sarno handles the money. Sorry, gentlemen. I'm not trusting any of you. I'm afraid I want to eat my cake and have it too. -The subscriber is unavailable.... -Shit. -You talked about killing her. -No one said "kill". They said "adjudicate", and that can mean a lot of things. There's a lot more going on in that room than you were seeing. What I heard was you're ready to risk a woman's life for money. Not money. 15 million dollars. Money is what you take to the grocery store... is what you get out of an ATM. 15 million dollars is not money. It 's a motive with a universal adaptor on it. -You don't think that those two...? -No, never. Never think. Thinking's how you lost your nerve in the first place, Dr. Painter. You think I don't know you? You think your father and I have secrets from each other? I know about your residency, your so-called hiatus. I know about that bad piece of luck you had in Baltimore. -I didn't lose my.... -I know... you weren't expected to deliver this kid. I know you can't. I know your skull is splitting down the middle... because you think this thing is gonna play out... and you're going to have to deliver this baby into the world. Well, what happened in Baltimore will not happen here. You understand? Because I won't let it. So... don't think, Dr. Painter, just do. And whatever you do, don't tell them what I know. Keep your mouth shut and everything will be just fine. Just fine. Dumping Sarno is going to be tough to explain. Tougher still to do. I ain't buying that survivor bullshit. He'll drop from a skull shot like any other man. We just take him out before he goes in. Bring the money in ourselves. After that, it 's our word against the desert 's. Creative articulation, baby. What is it? Something in there between Sarno and Chidduck. It ain't clear and it 's chapping my ass. -What was that shit about conflict? -He said, this is about my child... this is a special conflict. Why would saving somebody else's child... would be a conflict to anyone? Unless... -The girl. -Sarno. All set, Doc? I was up on this robbery bit... with a public defender. I was looking at my first long stretch. Out of nowhere, this uptown lawyer comes and says he'll get me off. He says he'll do it for free, I just gotta do a favor in return. Then he tells me about this teacher who's molesting his son. I went up alone. Didn't make a sound. There was nice carpet on the stairs and a light busted in the hall. The door was open, man. It was like it was meant to be. And I slipped in and I found him in the bedroom, naked. With all these pictures on the bed. Man, that lawyer was right. He was more than right. Then he turned around, and I didn't hit him. I just said: "Lay on the bed face down." And he did. I was savoring it. I mean, really, really enjoying it... thinking I would take a Polaroid of this and send it to that lawyer... so he could sleep better at night. Maybe one for myself, so I could.... And then I heard him pray. "Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray You, Lord, my soul to keep." And you know something? It stayed with me. It bothered me. Of all the people I'd done it to, that had to be the one I felt. And to this day, I can't go to sleep unless I say that prayer. You wanna get out now? You wanna quit? This is never gonna come your way again. What if your day comes and you're face down, waiting? And what if in that final second of life you start to believe in God? What are you gonna have to give Him? What will you say in your defense? What does it matter we take a child away from his mother? After all the people we've robbed and maimed and murdered... you think it matters? It matters. Believe me, it matters. Want to leave her a note? No, you know, I think it 's better if we just leave. -We can't leave her alone like that. -There's some guy hiding. -He'll get her when we're gone. -All right. I left my jacket in there. I'll get it. You know what I'm gonna tell God when I see Him? I'm gonna tell him I was framed. I'm at the Nacio Madre Hotel. There's been a shooting. -A woman in your condition... -The police are on their way! You can come in shooting! At least I'll be taking one of you with us! Just get in your fucking car and move on! I got all night long! I'm not moving! Test me! Peek-a-boo. Is that baby hungry yet, Robin? -Whose money is it? -The worst. -Do you believe in karma, Joe? -Karma? Karma is only justice without the satisfaction. I don't believe in justice. Well, tonight I certainly hope you're right. Fucking useless. -What's your location? -We arrived at the motel. Help me. Captain... it 's all under control. Thanks. It 's okay. It 's all under control. Thanks. -Robin, get in the car. -It 's okay, understand? -Stay calm. -Robin... -Excuse me, fella. -Who are you? -Help me. -Robin. Robin... Robin, get in the car. -Don't do it. -Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? -Let me see your hands. -Mind your business. Robin... ...come with me and get in the car. -Easy, okay? -It 's over. Get in the car. -Freeze. Easy, okay?. -Hands on the car. -Put your hands on the car. -What are we doing? -He wants our hands on the car. You too. -Me too? -Hands on the car. -Are you for real? -I've got reality here in my hand. -I found a gun. -Lie down. Both of you. He wants us to get on the ground. Central, this is 44. We need backup. Get up! Get up! She's going for the car, man. Robin, come, get in the car! Careful. If I want to hit her, I hit her. If I want to miss, I miss. Come, get in the car right now! To the right, to the right! Come on. Why are they headed south? Where are we going? -Fuck! -We have her! Just take us back. Those shots were coming from north. I'm not driving through more of that. -Shouldn't we call Sarno? -Yeah, I'm gonna call him all right. I've a place we can go until it 's safe. Trust me. It 's okay. The worst of it 's behind us. Promise me something. You promise me I'll see my baby before he takes him back. I promise. Yeah, it 's me again. We're coming. Tell him to be ready. It's me. -Where have you been? -I've been trying to get a signal! A couple guys showed up. It got pretty choppy. One of them made off with her. -They're headed south. -Is Robin all right? Yeah,she seems okay. You just keep heading south. I'll talk to you in as best I can. Abner, listen... I'm sorry I couldn't put my hand to her. I gotta go. I'll pull out your fingernails and leave you to think about it. Later, I'll come back and I'll slash your eyeballs. Whatever else I'll do to you after that... I'll pour gasoline into your eyes just to keep you from passing out. Bottom line is, I'll ask you a question and I'll never ask again. Where did they take the girl? I don't know. God! Dear God! Please help me. Please! -What happened to you? -I need to get to a hospital! Who did that to you? Why do you look so sad? Get out of here and don't come back, girl. Stupid whore. Bitch! What is this? I've got a business to run, for Christ 's sakes! I left her with the doctor. Where were you? I had to go to the.... What happened? -Please, help. -Who took your IV out? -Let 's get it back in. -I don't want it! Pregnant women walking around... bleeding and upsetting my customers. You are getting paid a lot of money... and I cannot do this by myself. Don't ever let her leave your sight again. If I don't put the IV back, your labor's gonna stop, okay? -What 's the matter? -It 's killing me. Something's wrong. I don't see any money. This is 5O. I will make a call. You will have double that in another hour. -So make the phone call. -It hurts. I need the fucking baby first. Will you please help me tie her down? It won't come out. It 's killing me. Oh my God. -Is she supposed to be bleeding? -She's had an abruption. The placenta has separated from her uterus. She's bleeding internally. It 's going to be okay. You're going to be okay. -Make it stop. -Is the baby going to die? What? What is it? I have to give her a C-section. -Do it. -A delivery is one thing! You're talking about major surgery! I could kill her. I have to get her to a hospital right away! My only concern right now is for the child, Dr. Painter. You're going to do it. It 's our baby! Tell him it 's our baby and he'll let us go! It 's not the Chidducks'! They can have another baby! Just tell him it 's our baby! Is this true? Tell him! He'll let us go! Tell him! Are you comfortable, Robin? We're going to take out your baby now. -What is that? -It 's a spinal. Don't knock me out. I have to see my baby, Allen. -I just want to see my baby. -It 'll numb you from the waist down. Stay still. I'm gonna get a smoke. She's... she's up there with them. The doctor and the... colored fella. I'm sorry, Joe. No need to be sorry, Abner. I'm dying. We'll get somebody right away. It 's not like I'm scared or anything. -Listen, Abner... -I'm dying, Jack. Remember that time... that time that we.... -Oh, jeez. -What? I'm dying, Joe. I'm sorry, Abner. Joe... I'm right here. If it 's not too much trouble... I'd kinda like to be alone. Till that day, pal. For Christ 's sake, will you? I think there are some men here to see you. Can I get some help in here? -Can you walk? -I wanna get this cocksucker. -Oh, no. -What is it, man? Bagmen. Let 's get the girl. -I wanna see my baby. -You got it, Doc? Almost. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is my baby okay? My baby. How's the baby, Doc? What 's going on with the baby, Doc? Doc? -Get back in there, Doc. -I'm sorry. You coming, man? Come on. My baby. Come on, brother. Let 's do this. She's had enough, man. Just relax now. Almost there. It 's under control. There's nothing you can do here. Get out. There's always free cheese in a mousetrap. What do you think? I think a plan is just a list of things that don't happen. If we die... we die alone. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm still here. -Are you still with me? -I'm still here. Come on up. So, you're going to let her keep the baby? It 's her baby. Her and the doctor. Is that true? What do you think? Come on. You can tell somebody's family just by looking at them. Till that day, then. Till that day. What are you gonna tell God now? We don't want your forgiveness. We won't make excuses. We're not gonna blame you even if you are an accessory. But we will not accept your natural order. We didn't come for absolution. We didn't ask to be redeemed. But isn't that the way it is? Every goddamn time. Your prayers are always answered... in the order they're received. I'm pregnant.
