Please care for my two daughters as if they were your own Don`t let your brother, Durjan, influence them in any way I`ve bequeathed my entire property to you Here, Mansingh. Read it out to him I, Thakur Surjeet Singh, son of Thakur Jasbir Singh Being of sound mind... ...make this will that after I die, the inheritor of my entire property... ..and of the treasure hidden in the dungeon ...will be my son Thakur Raghuveer Singh My eldest son, Durjan, I am ashamed to call my son Since he lost his way in search of black magic and sorcery With this will I disinherit him So, you disinherit me, old man? As you lie here on your death bed How dare you speak like this. Get out of here!. I`m leaving, but be sure of one thing, brother You will not live to inherit this property And hear me out before dying, old man! That black magic and sorcery, for which you disinherit me... will be the means by which I shall own all of your property Go out of here, you insolent fool! Get out of here, I say! Father! Father! In spite of being buried here these many thousands of years this body is still alive Whose corpse is this, Chief? This is not a corpse This is the Demon God, made from sacrificial soil Its soul has died with time but the body lives still Blood from a sacrificed innocent can bring it once more to life I will perform that sacrifice... when I slaughter the children of Thakur Raghuveer Singh! Mansingh! Mansingh! Mansingh! Raghuveer, my friend. How did this happen? How? That bastard, Durjan, attacked us along with his men He injured me badly and kidnapped both my daughters What? Mangal, take him inside immediately No, friend, it`s too late now I am dying Raghuveer, my friend! Mansingh, that wicked Durjan has kidnapped my two young daughters - He plans to sacrifice them - Sacrifice? But, why? He wants to steal the treasure hidden in the Dark Cave He needs the map to find it That treasure belongs to our ancestors, Mansingh - What`s this? - A map of the treasure But only half of it The other half is in a locket around my eldest daughter`s neck Oh, master! Oh, powerful ruler of the underworld Grant me everlasting youth and immortal life I sacrifice to you these innocent children... that I may myself live the years left to them And thus gain long life and finally immortality Master! Master! Thakur Mansingh`s men attacked us - You must escape - What`s this? Take the secret route out and bring the children Hurry up! - Leave me - Hurry up Leave me. Leave me. Leave me Arrest this treacherous man! Ensure no one escapes! You traitor! You have killed my friend Thakur Raghuveer Singh! And to appease your Demon God, you planned to sacrifice his children - Tell me where they are - I don`t know Mangal, search for them Bind this fool with chains and take him to the dungeon Stop or I shoot! Let me go. Let me go... Sister! Sister! Sapna! Sapna! Sapna! Sister! Mangal! Mangal! Mangal! Where is the other girl? I could save only the younger one, Mansingh The elder daughter is lost somewhere in the jungle I couldn`t find her. I couldn`t find her I see...so this is the Demon God to whom you have dedicated your life How many innocent lives have you sacrificed in his evil name? He is not evil, but the Emperor of the dark world, Mansingh For thousands of years, men like you have tried to destroy him But this Demon God made from the sacrificial mud will never perish Never! Never! Very well! Then keep worshipping him in this dark cave Here in this dungeon, you will be starved of sunlight Your body will be gasping for fresh air in the dark pit In this place you so love you will die a hideous death My death will give new life to the Demon God As for that treasure you denied me possession of... no other human hand will ever possess it Take him away Come! Mansingh... Remember one thing, Mansingh! The Demon God will kill all who enter this dungeon in search of that treasure Mansingh! So, Mr Superstar, have you ordered something to eat?

This servant of yours has served his time Today I shall destroy this body of mine This locket that daddy gave to us just before he died...

I`ll help you in any way I can You really believe this story? Listen, kids, these dungeons, treasures, mansions, lockets... This is all out of a fairy story for kids Your father spent 20 years looking for that locket and the treasure You really think it exists? No chance It does exist... And I will find it OK, Vijay, l`m off now OK. We`ll come see you in Bombay What`s on your mind? I`m thinking about my sister Sapna Vijay, after daddy`s death, your father looked after me But my sister, Sapna, she was all alone I`ve no idea what she`s doing or even where she is I want to see the owner Regarding what? I need a job Sorry sister, there`s no point. There are no jobs here Can`t you at least ask. I really need to work I`d be very grateful to you Okay, l`ll ask then There`s a girl looking for work Mona, you know very well there`s no vacancy here Hey, hold on. Send her in Right Shakaal, you`re very fond of girls, right? Who knows how desperate she is Are you the owner? Please have a seat - Have you worked before? - No, sir - So what can you do? - Anything - Anything? - I mean, any kind of work Can you dance?

Just take it Okay, but you`ll have to agree something for me Take this locket. Keep it until I pay you back It`s beautiful. Where did you buy it? - From my father - Are you crazy...? You can`t give this away This is your father`s gift, I can`t take it I`ll never forget your kindness Aarti... I`ve found your sister! I told you l`d find her for you one day Here`s her photo In the papers... take a look Is this really her? My sister`s photograph... See that locket around her neck? It`s like the one you`ve got. But the other half Looks like it But where is she? Wouldn`t you like to know Tell me, Anand, please She`s a dancer in a Bombay hotel A cabaret dancer?

Look... she`s wearing the same locket This girl is a dancer and came to Bombay in search of a job I know her She came here looking for a job But we didn`t have anything for her So... do you know where she went? I don`t know that, but she was desperately in need of money So she sold the locket to a girl here - She sold it? - Don`t worry, I bought it I`ve got it here.

This is no trick nor is it any magic Zabardast believes whoever killed Kallu... is a laundryman from Ghatkopar - A laundryman? - Yes That`s why the corpse was left hanging on the wall to dry Come on, put some energy into it And that other thing was an accident Accident? No way, it was a trap Someone killed Kallu How else would he end up hanging on the wall covered in blood? But who did it? You two look busy I guess you found the treasure - Is that so, Vijay? - No, brother And we lost two friends down there... in that horrible dungeon Listen to me, sir That basement is just like a labyrinth Everyone who goes down there gets lost You migth be right, Panna.

Chew that bone well, it`ll be your last one Vijay, I think we have the complete map now The map Shakaal gave us was a fake I never thought he`d turn out to be such a creep I never trusted him If that locket hadn`t been faked those men wouldn`t have died Well... it should be easy to find that treasure now I`ll do what I can to help you But remember me when you do find it Boss, those idiots have got the original locket If they join both the lockets and find that trident symbol they`ll find the treasure No, Rana Shakaal doesn`t give in I shall get that back locket tonight Who is it? Who`s there? Best keep quiet. Or l`ll kill you like I did your sister I`ve found the treasure And now I have to kill you Because if you escape then everyone will know What is it, Aarti?! In... in the dungeon What about it? What were you doing there? I was asleep in bed, Shakaal came in He was about to kill me Somehow I got away from him I ended up in the dungeon. I even saw the treasure Shakaal was about to take it, but.. But, what...? It killed Shakaal - What killed him? - A living corpse It was horrible.

Looks like the monster is headed for the village Listen everyone... Now that the beast is loose the whole village is in danger But don`t lose courage We will fight this evil together and we will triumph! So let`s get to work and find this evil creature Uncle Ram Who could it be at this hour? Go and have a look Vijay, what are you all doing here at this hour? Shakaal and my dear friend, Anand, have both been killed Killed? What are you saying?
