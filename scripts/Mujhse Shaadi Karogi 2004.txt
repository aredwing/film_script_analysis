Now, tell me. Why did you hit Chintu? l was angry because he abused you. Sameer, my mother says, anger is love's worst enemy. One who can't control his temper.. ..can't control anything in his lifetime. Now, stop being angry and smile. Smile! So, you won't smile? l'll set your mood right in a moment. The insolent! - Go topless. Those with iron pyjamas.. - ave an ape for an uncle! Whose aunts are cats.. - ave dogs for friends! When it comes to the pickle.. - They hug, buddy! This is too much. his is too much. Sameer gets into a fight with someone or the other eery day.. ..and today, he raised his hands on me! he Principal! So much of anger is not good, Ma'am. lt's Arun who always calms him down. e was born with the temper. ow will l explain.. ver since his parents have died.. ..his temper is getting worse and worse. l understand, ma'am. nd that is why l'm not throwing him out of the school. But l'm really worried. lf this is how Sameer alhotra's childhood is.. ..how is his adolescence going to be? Sameer, stop it. Sameer.. Sameer. No. So, these three fractures and the 36 stitches.. ls it all your doing? - Yes, sir. l'e thrashed them. But you must ask them why l hit them. ey, come on, babe. Come on, babe. - Stop it. elp! No! Stop it. There's this girl Sameer wants to marry.. ..and these guys were treating her like a ball in the basket! ln 1 998, you beat up a professor in the college? e didn't have any time to teach the boys. But he would call the girls home all alone and give them tuitions. e had eil on his mind. So, l gae it to him! What wrong did l do? ln the year 2000, you rescued a man who was drowning.. ..and gave him a beating? - l was the one who saved him too! There was a board which said in bold letters, "Swimming is forbidden." "Danger zone." Then why did he go there? l gae it to him. What wrong did l do? Look, we hae receied eight complaints.. ..against you in the last fie years. You might get more.. Listen this is my last warning to you. lf l receie another complaint, you're going straight to jail! Rs.3000. Fine. You may kiss the bride. Roma? You'e got married? Sameer, please, today is my wedding day. Don't be angry today. Please don't hit someone. l'll.. - No, wait here.

No girl can eer fall in loe with you. She can only be afraid of you. - Why? You hae such a temper, een l'm afraid of you. Remember how you thrashed those boys at the basketball court, Sameer? But they had made a mistake. They had to be punished. very human being makes a mistake. What if l had made a mistake? You'd hae hit me too, isn't it? lsn't it true? Let's go. Sameer, are you really going away? - Yes, Grandma. l've got the job of a lifeguard in Goa. lt's a nice job. Besides, l get into a lot of fights here, Grandma. lf l go to a new place and meet new people, l might not get into fights. My son, think again before you go. The reason behind the fights is your temper. Your temper will go with you wherever you go. Yes, Brother. lf you leae, l'll be worried about you all the time. You're the one l'll worry about. l've got to get you educated and married. l've got to have grandma's eyes operated upon.. ..and send her to grandpa in heaven at the earliest. l'm not going away in a hurry. e'll have to wait!

That's Mr. Duggal! But he's looking at me. - No, you're looking at him. Let me show you. Wait. ldiots! You hit me because l'm blind today?

Once l took his gun and ran to the fields for some shooting practice. nraged, he snatched the gun.. ..and said, "lt's an official gun." l was so peeed that l joined the army.. ..and l got my own gun. "Come, beloed." few years later, war for independence broke out in Goa. They posted me here in Goa. fter the war, l settled here with my family. Luckily, l love Goa. Luckily, l love Goa too. What do they call a chicken in Punjab? - Kukdi. nd a girl? - Kudi.. Kukdi. - Kukdi.. Wow. hose medals.. did you win them, sir? My wife wasn't in the army, so, obviously they belong to me. Sorry, sir. ctually, sir, your personality unsettles me. That's why l'm talking like a fool. Never mind. nd that Chinese pot near the medals.. ..looks like an antique piece, does it contain Chinese tea? lt contains my late mother's ashes. lt gives me a feeling that l always hae her blessings with me. You loed your mother dearly. - l still loe her. We tried really hard to save her. But what God wills.. - Let it be, Papa. Shall we start the dinner? One second..

Because of me, really? - You asked me to uncork it at one go. l asked you to open the bottle, not to break the pot of ashes. lt's good that the pot broke. t least it has set his mother's soul free. "Come, beloed." l think the colonel is insane. Oh, no.. he's a ery intelligent man. lntelligent, my foot! Mother's ashes ought to be immersed in the Ganges. No one keeps it at home. Never in a pot, at that! lt's okay, we'll talk later. - Let me clear this now. Please try to see it from my point of iew. Why don't you try to see it from my point of iew? ave you seen the colonel? e looks as if he grew old twenty years back. Look at his wife.. as if she has just stepped into youth. Tell me, from what angle does Rani look like the colonel's daughter? Yes, ommy does appear to be his son. l can't explain that. You should be asking the person concerned. Who? - Rani. The colonel would neer reveal the secret to Rani. The other day, l spared you because it was only a mistake. But today, you intentionally.. You hit my papa on his face.. ..still l forgae you. ut today, you'e hurt me in the heart. Can you explain? - Rani.. Did you intend to say that my father didn't sire me? No! - That my mother is wanton? No! - Don't talk to me again. Don't eer talk to me.. eer. lt was tough conincing myself that you are a nice person. nd you, priest! l'm really surprised. ow could you consider such a lowly man a friend? No. Let alone respect someone, he hardly knows what respect means. Rani. See? She is hurt because of you! - Because of me, really? l was only kidding. When you knew Rani was standing behind me.. ..why didn't you tell me? - l was telling you.. ..to see from my point of view! - Your language is too tough for me For all the mistakes you commit, you pass the buck on to me! God! Uncle, ball, please. - Ball? What happened? - flat tyre? No, someone got thrashed. Who? - Papa! Granny! l'm ill-fated, it's writ. Reading my horoscope won't turn things around.
