How I, the Baron Hartog, avenged her death. The enemies I sought were no ordinary mortals. They were murderers from beyond the grave. For this ruined castle, where I lay in wait, had once been the home of the Karnstein family and at certain times, their evil spirits thrust out from their moldering tombs and took a kind of human shape to roam the countryside and seek for victims to satisfy their need, their passion, their thirst for blood. Sometimes, to court its victim, savoring its enjoyment. At other times, to strangle and exhaust at a single feast. I knew the specter, when satiated, would return to its grave. I also knew that without the shroud, in which it was interred to cloak its festering body, there could be no night of rest for any vampire. My heart pounded with apprehension as I watched the creature search around its grave. My limbs would scarcely obey but I challenged the monster out there, whatever it might be, to reclaim its shroud. A vampire can be destroyed only by a stake through the heart or decapitation. I waited, sword in hand. - Miss Emma, do you have to leave? - I'm afraid so. There'll be another time. Mr. Morton. - General. Delightful party. - So glad you enjoyed it. Thank you, Laura. It was a lovely party. And I think Carl's very handsome. Must you go? It's so early. We have a long journey home. Very happy birthday. And remember, you're coming to stay very soon. I'm looking forward to it. General. Goodbye. Excuse me. My dear Countess, I am honored. General Spielsdorf, so charming of you to invite us. May I... May I present my daughter, Marcilla. - Who is that? - They've just moved about 5km away. Where the old baroness used to live. Well, we must love our neighbors, Kurt. - Will you dance, Countess? - Enchanted. - Carl, I do love you. - What? Every other young man is staring at that girl over there except you. I do believe she'd like to take you away from me. She keeps staring at you. Nonsense. She's looking at you. Excuse me, General. Bad news? - A dear friend of mine is dying. - I am so very sorry. You will forgive me, leaving you like this? Is there anything I can do? Well, I hardly dare to ask you but my daughter, Marcilla. It is a long journey. We must ride all night. My dear Countess, I assure you it would be my pleasure to look after your daughter, if you so wish. And she'll be good company for Laura. - General, you are too kind. - Not at all. I must tell Marcilla. - I'm so sorry. - Goodbye and a safe journey. Would you like her to stay with us? - Yes, of course, Uncle. - Good. Where is she? You did frighten us last night. I went for a walk. Your uncle's estate is so big, I lost myself. For hours. Everyone was looking for you. And then you just suddenly appeared, as if by magic. You must not worry about me. I like to wander off on my own sometimes. Dear Laura, I do feel we'll be such good friends. We already are. - How beautiful you are. - Now you're just teasing me, like Carl always does. What is it? There. It was... It was a cat. A huge cat. It was choking me. There, now. You were having a nightmare, that's all. Now, you settle down and have a nice sleep. That's right. There we are. I'm sorry. That's all right. You gave us all quite a fright, though. Thought it was some prowler. You try and get some rest. Good night, darling. You'll be all right now. All right, thank you. Such screams. It's enough to wake the dead. It must have frightened poor Marcilla to death. - Better see how she is. - Yes. - Let her sleep. - All right. - Good night. - Good night, sir. It troubles me, Doctor. The child seems to get weaker and weaker. Anemia. They don't eat, only think of their figures. Common with young girls, sir, I assure you. And a few old ones, too. But these dreadful nightmares she keeps having. Body weakens, mind gets active. Needs some iron, that's all. Greenstuffs, red meat. Put some blood back into her. A drop of port, perhaps, at night. I'm glad you don't regard it as too serious. She'll be all right. - I'll ride over again in a day or two. - I'd be very grateful. Goodbye, Doctor. Thank you. Marcilla, you're so kind to me. I swear I shall die when you leave. I shall never leave you, my dearest Laura. I've been to the Wollheimers' farm, the new barn's ready. Good. How is Laura, sir? May I see her? No. I don't understand her. She doesn't want to see anyone except... Yes. Laura seems devoted to her. Nevertheless, I shall be glad when the Countess comes back for her. No, please, no. No, no, go away. No more, go. No, please, no. Doctor. Doctor, you must come at once. Fetch her. She'll be here very soon. Where the devil is she? I don't know, sir, her room is empty. I... I am here. I could not sleep. I went to the chapel to pray. You may open the curtains. It is daylight now. She is dead. No. Doctor, please, hurry. No. Poor Laura. And the General? The General has gone away, sir, to visit a friend, the Baron Hartog. Yes, he wouldn't want to stay in that house. I understand that. Mademoiselle Perrodot will look after her. - You all right? - Yeah. - Anyone hurt? - Steady. Steady, boy. My niece. My house is nearby. You must rest awhile. No, my journey is imperative. - Quick, quick. Fool. - Father. She's very shocked. We must take her home with us. I cannot. My brother is dying. I cannot delay. My name is Morton. If I may be allowed to suggest your niece... Carmilla. Carmilla would be welcome to stay with us - while you continue your journey. - No, it is impossible! My daughter would be grateful for the company. You are too kind. You're to stay with us! I can't say it. The eyebrow. German is so difficult. - But you must try. - I'll try tomorrow. All right. Get ready for dinner. - Your father will be home soon. - Yes. - Who is it? - It's me, Emma. Oh, do come in! Those dresses, aren't they beautiful! - You may wear one if you want to. - May I really? Emma, hand me that towel over there please. Yes. Thank you. Your dress is very pretty but it's for a country girl. In town you must be more sophisticated. You must take everything off! Try it once. - All right. - You can't put it over a bodice, it ruins the shape. I've never worn anything like this. I feel so daring. What would my father say? He will appreciate it, like all men. - But I think it will be too big. - It's not, I'm sure it's not. I'll show you. Look, Carmilla. What did I tell you? - Take the other dress I have. - No! It's too small for me. Yes, you must. Take the other dress! - I want you to. - No! - I say, take the other dress! - No! - Yes! - No! - Good evening, Mr. Morton. - Good evening. You look quite lovely. Thank you. - Red or white, miss? - Red, please. Emma, dear, what is it? What's the matter? - I must have dreamed. - Dreamed what? A great cat, it was there. It was a nightmare. No! My eyes were open, I swear I saw it. It was gray and big as a wolf. It had enormous eyes. All the better to see you with. Don't laugh at me. I'm sorry. I was only joking to make you feel better. But you must be rational. Either you had a nightmare or you were awake and saw a cat. A big cat! Gray! It's all right. Look, it's only Gustav. You're very bad, Gustav. Emma was terrified of you. But Mademoiselle Perrodot, it wasn't Gustav. It was a big cat! Gray! Shall I make Gustav big and gray for you? There you are. You see? Don't let your imagination get the better of you. I'm sorry. - Will you sleep now? - I'll try. Good. Trouble with this part of the world is they have too many fairy tales. I've let Emma sleep on. She had a bad nightmare again. It's beginning to worry me. She has them every night now. She's so pale and listless. I think she must be fretting over Laura. - Good morning. - Good morning. I wish it weren't necessary for me to go to Vienna today but you'll let me know how she is? Naturally. Why don't you call in the doctor? A tonic would do her good. I'm sure it's just nerves. - I can leave her safely with you. - Of course. I will take care of Emma. As though she were my own sister. I'll see how she is before I go. I'll come with you. No, thank you. I'm not hungry. Good to see you, sir. How's Emma? Not too well, just recently. A bit upset, I think, about Laura. I'm just off on a business trip to Vienna. Would you be able to go and see her while I'm away? Yes, of course, sir. If I can. I know you're busy but do try. Sometime this week. - I will, sir. - I must get on. She has a young friend staying with her. So there you are, two pretty girls to visit. Perhaps you'll feel stronger soon. I hope I shall be recovered when my father gets back. Of course you will. It's nothing, you mustn't worry about it. I try not to but I keep having these awful dreams. It happened again last night. I saw... Now, Emma, you mustn't allow yourself to be terrorized by your own imagination. I suppose it was the cat again. Yes. But Mademoiselle Perrodot, I must tell you, if I don't see these things, then I'm going mad! You mustn't talk like that. It was probably only poor Gustav again. Yes, it's just my imagination. Of course it is. Now, sit still and get some rest. It's just that your mind is overactive, that's all. "Pulling her gently towards him, "he showered her sweet, upturned face with manly kisses." This is a silly book. But it's a lovely story. Wouldn't you like to meet a handsome young man? No. Neither do you, I hope. I'd like to see one. I wish Carl would come again. - He is very handsome. - Who? Carl Ebhardt. He manages General Spielsdorf's estate. - Do you know the General? - No. His niece was my best friend. And then she died. You chat on like an old peasant woman sometimes! Always of death and tragedy. Carmilla, you are unkind. You know how it upsets me. I'm sorry. - Forgive me? - No. Forgive me. I shouldn't snap at you like that. You're so sensitive. Only about some things. - And about you. - Silly! Why about me? Because I love you! I don't want anyone taking you away from me. Taking me away? Who do you mean? You know we'll always be friends. Surely you don't mean my handsome young man? I do believe you're jealous! Why should I not be? Why? Because it's not the same thing. It's different. I want you to love me for all your life! Come along. That's enough chatter for tonight. Good night, Emma. Good night, Mademoiselle Perrodot. You are so kind. Carmilla, why do you always sit in the shade? The sun is too bright for me. It hurts my eyes. Then close them. It's glorious. You can feel the warmth penetrating. It's like life. You talk such nonsense sometimes. Stop it! Stop it! What is it? Nothing. Only that dreadful noise. The funeral? But it's the woodman's daughter! I hate funerals. Hate them! I thought it rather sad and yet beautiful. You must die! Everybody must die! But she was so young. There's been so much tragedy in the village recently. The blacksmith's young wife died only last week. My father said... You really are upset. And I've been saying all these foolish things. Come on, let's go home. Hold me. I beg you, hold me tight. "He enfolded her in his arms "and there was rapture in their wild embrace." There. Do let's have another chapter. You read so beautifully. Tomorrow. You're not going. I must. I'm sorry. You've read too much, I've tired you. Perhaps. I wish I felt tired. I never do, not at night. - Just sort of excited. - Do you? Yes, and I don't sleep, at least not for ages. And then I feel so wretched and tired during the day. - And do you dream? - You know I do. Horrid dreams, and so strange and lifelike. Tell me. I haven't told anyone. Not everything. I can't. Tell me! A cat comes and sits at the foot of my bed, staring. Then it reaches out towards me. And I try to scream. But my throat is strangled. And it lies across me, warm and heavy, and I feel its fur in my mouth. And I retch with fear! And then... And then? It turns into you. Me! And then you embrace me and kiss me. And suddenly everything's all right and I'm so happy. But even as you're holding me close, I feel a pain, sharp as needles, dragging at me. I feel the life running out of me, as though my blood were being drawn. And... I wake, and scream. My poor darling. You know you'll always be safe as long as you're with me? Mademoiselle Perrodot, it was there! It bit me! Look! It was my fault. A brooch I gave her. I told her to be careful. No! No, it was the cat! Go to sleep. Everything is all right now. Go to sleep. I have one, too. Do you see how sharp the pins are? Yes. - Let me give it to you. - No, I couldn't. Please, I want you to have it. She'll be quiet now. Turn down the lamp. Good morning, Mr. Ebhardt. Good morning, Mademoiselle. Mr. Morton asked me to call in and see Emma. When? When he left for Vienna. Emma is not here. She has gone for a picnic. She'll be out all day. - With her friend. - What friend? Mr. Morton said she had a friend staying with her. No, not any longer. I'll call back later perhaps. Tomorrow? We shall be busy tomorrow. Call next week, Mr. Ebhardt. Mr. Renton, it's Miss Emma. She looks so ill! Does Mademoiselle Perrodot know? I don't know, sir. I suppose so. She asked me to fetch her up a tray. Very well, Gretchin. - Excuse me, Mademoiselle. - Yes, Renton, what is it? It's Miss Emma. If I may be so bold, I think she should see the doctor. I shall send for the doctor should I think it necessary. Very good, Mademoiselle. Beautiful. But not as beautiful as you, my love. You've had more than enough tonight. She's right. Wouldn't do for a man in my position to be caught drunk. That's all right, while your master is away. That's just the point, Kurt. That's just the point. I'm left in a position of responsibility. Miss Emma is very ill. What is the nature of the illness, Mr. Renton? How would I know, man? I'm not the doctor! Why won't that bastard governess let me send for him? That's what I want to know. I shall send for the doctor should I think it necessary. Acts more like a bloody vampire, that one! It's only a joke! Not round here it isn't. There's been three deaths round here lately, none of them by natural causes. Just a scream in the night and then found there, pale as death. Pale as death. The blood drained from them. God! Good night, Mr. Renton. Doctor. What is it, my darling? I'm dying. Yes. Will I live until Father comes home? Perhaps. - Good evening. - Good evening, Doctor. There's a sharp wind tonight, Renton. I'm afraid Mr. Morton is away. Yes, I know. I had a message from him. Asked me to look in on Miss Emma. - Was this you, Renton? - Aye. She has not been well but I'm sure it's nothing. I'll be able to set his mind at rest, then. - Is she dead? - Not yet, thank heavens. What the devil have you got there? Garlic flowers, sir. They have an antiseptic scent. - Have you been listening to gossip? - No, sir. Illness is a matter for modern science, not witchcraft. Yes, sir. Take those flowers away at once. Mademoiselle, this is my patient. Kindly do not interfere. Quite healthy, I suppose. You can get some more, Renton. Yes, sir. - Where is Mademoiselle Perrodot? - I don't know, sir. Very well. See that Miss Emma is not disturbed. Have a maid sit up with her all night. - Very good. - I'll be back in the morning. Very well, sir. I have sent for Mr. Morton, sir. Good. Whatever happens, keep her away from Miss Emma. Yes, sir. - Good night, Doctor. - Good night. - Who told you to put those there? - Mr. Renton. - Take them out. - But he... Take them out! Yes, Mademoiselle. Remember I'm in charge during Mr. Morton's absence. Certainly. Why did you order those weeds to be put in her room? Not I, Mademoiselle. The doctor. I'm sure we agree that he is in charge of the patient. - Take those back, Gretchin. - Sir... Take them away. Why don't you take them away? Come on, boy. Jupiter. Come on, boy. Come on, Jupiter. What's the matter with you? Jupiter, come back, boy! - Good morning. - Good morning. How's Miss Emma? She is sleeping, sir, peacefully. Had it not been for the doctor and these remedies... It's ridiculous. I can't believe it. Neither could I, sir, at first. But let the landlord tell you. It is the Karnsteins come back. From that old ruined castle? They were all wiped out. Aye, sir. So we thought. There was a young nobleman whose sister was murdered by them. This gentleman, a Baron Hartog, he crept up to the castle late at night and he lay in wait. He saw a shroud and he knew that without it there would be no resting place for any vampire. Baron Hartog took the shroud and he waited. He chopped off the head of the vampire and he staked the rest in their graves. Then how could they be here now? It's nonsense. I beg you to listen. Think of Miss Emma. If you don't believe me, sir, ask General Spielsdorf. General Spielsdorf? The General has gone away, sir, to visit a friend, the Baron Hartog. Yes, I remember now. The General. That was where he went. Where is the doctor? He said he'd be here this morning. - Shall I send for him? - No, I'll go myself. - Gretchin? - Yes, miss? Do not disturb Mademoiselle Perrodot today, please. She's ill and wants to stay in her room. - Yes, miss. - How is Miss Emma? She doesn't get any better. She had a quiet night. - Are you going in to see her? - Perhaps. But I hate the smell of those flowers. Can't you remove them? I dare not. Mr. Renton said I wasn't to move them under any circumstances. - Where is Mr. Renton? - I don't know, miss. Thank you, Gretchin. I can't stop, I'm on my way to fetch the doctor. The doctor is with us, Mr. Morton. - What? Where? - Here. I traveled many miles to find the Baron Hartog. And very glad I am to make this journey back here with him. But you as an Englishman, Mr. Morton, will be less aware than we are of the need to seek out these evils immediately and to destroy them. Then you believe that it is true about this family of vampires? I know that it is true. You asked where we were going. Now I will tell you and you can leave us if you wish. Our destination is Karnstein Castle. I was determined to avenge the death of my sister. I knew where these monsters sprang from. And what had to be done to rid the world of them. But face to face, my limbs seemed paralyzed. I prayed to God to give me back their strength. But when the moment came, I could not move. That moment has been a nightmare all my life. I was saved by a cross I wore. As it touched the vision of beauty which confronted me, I felt a shock of evil. And God in his mercy gave power to my arm. It was a woman. A very beautiful woman. Thank you. I think I'll sit with Miss Emma for awhile. Yes, miss. - Yes, miss? - Could you remove those flowers? They upset Miss Emma. I'm sorry, miss. I can't do that. The doctor was most insistent. That seems silly. They have a horrid smell. You wouldn't cause Miss Emma discomfort? I'm sorry, miss. I can't move them. Why not? Why are they there? - I can't explain, miss. - Why not? I'm not a child. - You are in some things. - What things? It's best to keep away from Miss Emma's room and best to keep away from Mademoiselle Perrodot. Why Mademoiselle Perrodot? She is a wicked woman, if she's human. - You don't mean...? - Yes, miss. Oh, no! They were all evil in life and remained evil after death. That night, I disinterred their bodies one by one. I dug down into their graves and did what had to be done. I worked through the night until, in my exhaustion, I could dig no more. There was one grave I did not find. That of a young girl. After the horrors of the night, I couldn't spend another moment in this place. But here is her sweet and gentle face. Mircalla. Marcilla! That girl is a guest in my house. Her name is Carmilla. And my daughter is dying! Morton, wait! Ebhardt knows every inch of these forests. He'll get to your house in half the time. For God's sake, save her! That cross. It's marking her neck. Put it back in the case. - It's not marking her neck, sir. - Do as you're told, girl. No. Light, over here. We must find that grave and quickly. And take these away. But you said yourself... Do as I say! Here! It's over here. No shroud? Fetch the box. You can get up now. I think I'm too weak. No. I will give you strength. - Come. - Where? I'm taking you with me. - But my father. - Come. Hurry. - The coffin has gone. - For God's sake, where? Anywhere in this castle or in these grounds. But there is still time. I doubt if she has yet returned. She will not return until she has glutted herself with the blood of a victim. How can you be sure? Vampires are intelligent beings. They know when the forces of good are arraigned against them. She will want to rest a long time in her coffin. We must find that shroud. You are coming with me to my home. It's not far from here. You can rest there. Take me with you. Please! Holy Mother of God, protect me. Sacred Heart of Jesus, save me. Only now can I see the evil in her eyes. General! Into the chapel. Take the handles. Now. I will do it. He is praying that his daughter is still alive. I know that Laura is dead. Dear God, no! There's no other way. Let us pray to God that Stiria has been rid of these devils forever. It's over. It's over.
