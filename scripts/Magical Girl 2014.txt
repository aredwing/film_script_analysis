If Napoleon had invaded Spain 200 years ago and we were here talking in French... ...two plus two, of course, would still be four. I want you to understand that the only absolute truth, the only thing that will remain the same, is that two plus two equals four. Barbara, would you come here please? - What do you have there? - Nothing. Come on, Barbara, it's all right. What do you have there? - It's only a note. - What have you said, Marcos? That it's only a note. So you have a note. Marcos, go to the principal's office... ...and explain to her why you interrupt me when I'm talking to your classmates. Come on Barbara. You should show me that note and put an end to this nonsense Read it out loud, so your classmates can learn what's so important. - Do you want me to read it? - Yes, I want you to read it. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Read it please. I pity the pig-face. Silence! Silence! Is that what you think of me? I've asked you a question, Barbara. Is that what you think of me? Yes. Give me that note. Give me that note, Barbara! Give me that note! - I can't. - Why can't you? Because I don't have it. WORLD So... two kilos, not in bad condition... I can give you five euros. But "The Hive" is there. You can't pay me the same than for the DIY manual. That's the idea of buying books by weight. Yeah, but it's "The Hive", isn't it? Cela, he's a Nobel Prize winner. It's the nature of the store, books by weight, whatever they are. I can't do criticism with every book. If you agree, I'll give you the money. Ok, I'll keep "The Hive". Hello? Alicia? Alicia, my dear! How are you, honey? My arm hurts. They have bitten me, didn't they? No, they haven't. You have drip feed. We're in the hospital. Is the bull gone? Which bull, my dear? There was a black bull, very big. There's no bull, honey. You dreamed it. - Hello Luis. - Hello. - Hello Alicia. - Thanks. You're welcome, precious. How do you feel? A bit dizzy. That's normal. Rest a little bit. - Luis, could you come with me, please? - Sure. Hello. Luis! Dad! Tell me honey. - Hello. - Hello. - Are you all right? - Of course. - How about you? - Awesome. Dad. Dad! Tell me, honey. Can I sleep over at Makoto's on Saturday? Makoto? Do you have a Japanese friend? No, it's Vanesa's nickname. Why do you call her Makoto? Because it's her nick. Makoto is Vanesa's nickname. You must finish your therapsides work. I only have to write it out neatly. Yes, but you have to do it, Alicia. Can't you do it? Part of the work is to write it out neatly. It's not the same if I do it. Don't be brazen. If I finish it before Saturday I can go, can't I? I don't want you to rush it only to go to Vanesa's. If I don't rush it and finish before Saturday, I could go, couldn't I? They are all going. - Who are all? - Makoto, Sakura and me. - Sakura? - Paloma. - Oh, so it's Paloma and you going. - And Makoto. Vanesa doesn't count. She's at home. What are you going to do? Watch anime and eat ramen. Are her parents going to be there? I have to talk to them. - OK. - OK. - Can I ask you something? - Of course, honey. Can I smoke a cigarette? But... I want to know how it feels. I never smoked before. You have to take it to your mouth. You have to swallow the smoke with conviction. If you doubt, you'll cough. If you could choose a magical power, what would it be? I don't know... Come on, what would you choose? To be invisible. If you could choose two? To be intangible, so nobody could touch me. But that would be like not existing, wouldn't be? A bit, yes. - Do you know which one I would pick? - Which one? To be able to become whoever I wanted. I had thought of becoming the king and give a speech like... "Dear Spaniards, I feel proud that you kill the rest of Spaniards." - Alicia, don't swear. - I haven't. I don't like you to speak improperly. Can I ask you another thing? Of course, my dear. I'd like to have a gin-tonic. I think there's gin left. I don't know about tonic. - What's your nickname? - Yukiko. Yukiko. It's beautiful. "Book of desires" "Wish 1: to become whoever I want" "Wish 2: Magical Girl Yukiko's dress designed by Meiko Saori for singer Megumi" Yukikio. "Wish 3: to turn 13" I'm leaving darling. See you in the afternoon. - Wait. - What's up? - Just wait. - What's up? The lady will tell me whenever she wants. See you later, honey. - Dad - Tell me. You forget your cell phone. One day I'll lose my head. See you later, precious. Today, in the letters' section we have a very special letter. And I say it's a very special letter because it's written by a 12-year-old girl. Because she dedicates it to her father, and because she has leukemia. She's Alicia, and her letter goes like this... Good morning. - Hello. - Hello... Luis! Long time no see! How are you, doll? Ramon was here this morning and we were precisely talking about you. I haven't seen him for ages. His bar was closed, did you know that? I don't know where this is going. I didn't know. What a bummer! If someone had told me this three years ago, even one year ago, I wouldn't have believed it. It goes like this, little by little, and in the end you get used to it. How about you? Staying afloat, which is no small feat. And you? - What are you having? - A beer. What can you do? Even if you get rid of the politicians, nothing will change. - Olives or chips? - Olives. The problem in this country is that the banker is as corrupt as the worker. That's the problem. - Here you go. - I guess so. - How is your girl doing? - Not too well, to be honest. Is she having surgery again or will she go back to chemo? Yes, she will have chemo but... No shit! I'm so sorry, Luis. Is there anything I can do for you? I know Marisol, thanks a lot. Indeed I'd like to talk to you in private. Yes, sure. I'd like to buy Alicia something she wants, but you know my situation. How much money would it take? 7,000. I can work for free here as long as you want. Damn Luis, that's a lot of money. I'm up to the limit. Of course. I can't lend you so much money because, for starters, I don't have it. I know. I shouldn't have left you in a predicament. I don't know what to do. You could look for a job where you can get paid in advance. But things are difficult. No. Thanks. What do you want to buy to Alicia that is so expensive? - It's a dress from a cartoon. - Like a disguise? No, it's a dress by a famous designer. That's why it's so pricey. There's only one. The only thing Alicia wants is you to be close to her. What matters is to be together. The dress, the money, that's trivial. Yes. I'm out of job but I'm waiting for the result of some interviews. The ad said that no collateral was needed. Right, but I want to know if it's possible. I don't have collateral, but I can pay the interest. I know it's not a good time, but I need the money. It's important to me. Don't be sorry. Today, in the letters' section we have a very special letter. And I say it's a very special letter because it's written by a 12-year-old girl. Because she dedicates it to her father, and because she has leukemia. She's Alicia, and her letter goes like this... "I'm writing this letter to you from the hospital room I like coming here a lot. At the beginning I was afraid and I hated it, but now I love it. I know it's weird. Nobody likes hospitals. I like the smell of the corridors, I like the food, I like the Band-Aids and the needles. Do you know why? Because I know whenever I wake up here you are by my side." Barbara. Barbara! Close your eyes. Don't open them until I say so. Now. - Why this? - Just because. Thank you. Will you put it on me? Thanks. - Today I want to be alone with you. - But we're meeting Javier and Laura. - So we tell them we're sick. - They're about to arrive, Bar. So we don't open the door. We make up an excuse. Don't you mind looking bad to them? You're a fickle and fool girl. Oh yeah, you're a fickle and fool girl. - And what else are you? - Pretty. - What time is it? - I don't know. It's 12:15. I can't go on like this. I can't watch over you as if you were a little girl. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Thanks. Do I have to watch over you as if you were a little girl? - No. - No? I think yes. - No. - Yes. If I ever find out you're lying to me, I swear I'll leave and never come back. - Do you take the pill every day? - Yes. Take it. Open your mouth. - Barbara, this is for your own good. - Yes, I know. I'm sorry. Sorry, I'm a fool. I don't want you to worry about me. I just want you to be more responsible with your medication. Sorry for getting angry. It's ok. You get angry because you love me. "The wolf has five cubs white and black behind the groom." "Five she raised, five she took care of, And all five of them she nursed." You've made up the "white and black" line, haven't you? No, that's the way my mother sang it. - "White and black"? - Yes. It was "The wolf has five cubs, five cubs behind the groom." Not "white and black". Javi, it's a nursery rhyme. I also knew the "white and black" version. - You too? - Yes. So I'm the only one who doesn't know this version. Come on! Barbara, are you all right? Yes. I had a little headache, but I'm fine. - Do you want an aspirin? - No really, I'm fine. Do you want to hold her? I'm a bit afraid. - She's not going to bite you. - Right... I don't know how. Look. Come. Let's go. Like this. Be careful. What's up? Nothing, I was remembering something. - What's up? - No really, nothing. Tell us so we can laugh. I can't stop thinking of your face if I threw the baby out of the window. DEVIL It was a joke. Take it. - This is not the usual pill. - That's right, it's not the usual pill. - What is it? - It's a sleeping pill. A sleeping pill. - Why do you give it to me? - I want you to sleep. I was going to take a nap anyway. I want you to have a deep sleep. - Rinse and swallow the water. - What? Rinse carefully and swallow the water, please. Open your mouth. Thank you. - What's going on? - Nothing happens, my love. Trust me. "The moon kisses your pure tears" "Like a promise of good fortune" "People call you Fire Girl" "And they are letting you die of thirst" "Oh Fire Girl, oh Fire Girl" "Inside my soul I have a fountain" "So your guilt bends to drink" "Affection is blind" "I'm a good and sympathetic man" "Come on, come with me, Fire Girl" Yes? Hello? If you don't answer, I'm hanging up. - Goodbye. - I'm Barbara. Wait! Please! Please wait! I'm sorry. There's a bathroom in the corridor. You can have a shower. Leave your clothes at the door and I'll wash them. A damp cloth will remove it. It's no problem, I have a dryer. Yes. The clean towels are the blue ones. I've put on this. It's ok. Do you want a beer, water or something? No, thanks. Are you alright? Yes. I'm usually clumsy. I'm used to it. You have an amazing home, it's beautiful. Thanks. What do you do? Nothing. I watch the TV. My husband supports me. What have you watched on TV lately? I watched a report on two neighbors who were angry at each other because... one blamed the other of pouring pee on her each time she'll go in and out of the house. So the lady would wear a raincoat and a bin bag each time she'll go by. She was very funny. Why did you find it so funny? Why not? I don't know. I don't like those shows that exploit others' miseries. It seems they'd tell us not to complain because, deep down, we're not as bad. We're not as bad. Not as bad? I guess it's easy to say so living here. What do you do? I used to be a teacher. Now I'm unemployed. - What did you teach? - Literature. Literature? I always failed literature. You didn't like reading. I preferred doing other things too much. And your husband, what does he do? He's a psychiatrist. - He must be good. - Yes. - Can I ask you were he is? - No. Listen... can you hug me? - What? - No, forgive me. Forget it. No. Of course, yes. Let's go. What are you doing? Nothing. What do you mean nothing? What are you doing? I told you I'm married. You're at my husband's home. I'm sorry. - I find it astonishing. - Me too. What do you find astonishing? Will the washer go much longer? Eh? No, it's a short cycle. So what do you find astonishing? I can wait in the living room. I'm sorry. I'm a bit tense. Why did you come down to me? Do you find me disgusting? Do you know why I watch those TV shows? Because I like to see people more miserable than me. Do you find me disgusting now? No. My name is Barbara. I am Pedro. - Hello. - Hello. What's happened to you? I was doing chores to free my mind, and the mirror fell over me. Are you alright? Look Bar, I've been thinking and I've made a decision. I'm going to trust you. It's what I can offer, my blind faith. But if I learn about one more lie, it's over. I need you, but you need me a lot more. Did you spit the pill yesterday? - Yes. - Why? Hello? Yes, but she can't now. For real. Wait. It's for you. Hello? Hello Barbara. I'm Pedro. I guess the man answering was your husband. I've told him I'm from your phone company, so try to pretend. I couldn't find out your cell phone number. You'll tell me later, so it'll be easier to get in touch. I also looked for your credit cards, but you don't have any. That would've made everything easier. Look, I'm very sorry about this. I need 7,000 euros within a week or I'll tell your husband everything. I left the cell phone recorder on. Everything is recorded. Tell me you understand. Yes. Ok. Now give me your cell phone number. I'll call you from a cell phone so you have it. Now I'm calling from a public number. When the money is ready, call me and I'll tell you how to deliver it. Ok. When you give me the money I won't bother you again. I'm sorry. Me too. I'm not interested. I rarely use the cell phone. Thanks a lot. Hello. Hello. Your face looks familiar. Are you an actress? - No. - I am. Ok. Do you know if Ada is at home? Do you know my name? - No. - Sonica. Fine. I'm Barbara Asuncion. Is Ada at home? - I'm asking if Ada is at home? - Yes. Thanks. Hello Barbara. Here's to reunions. To reunions. How are you doing? Fine. I'm glad. I'm sorry how I left, Ada. I didn't know how to do it. You only had to say goodbye. - It's not so easy. - Yes, it is. Do you know what offended me the most? It wasn't you disappearing without a word, that only worried me. It was offensive to feel that you were scared of me. Because I have never done anything for you to feel scared. That's not the way I am, and you know it. I didn't want to offend you. It's happened other times. I'm used to it. Anyway, I'm happy to see you doing well. - How about you? - Better than ever. Business is a bit down, but I got married four months ago and I'm very happy. Congratulations. Who is the lucky one? Juana. Juana? I like that girl. Well... what can I do for you? I don't want to bother you. I'm very sympathetic. You've just seen it. I need money. - You don't need money. - Pardon? You don't need money. Your husband has plenty. I had to make sure you were fine. It's a personal business. I have to work it out on my own. Good girl. How much money we're talking about? 7,000. If you give it to me now, I can pay you back with a 15% rate in five or six months. You know what I do and you've come to me. If you want 7,000 you know what to do. If you're not willing, we'll finish the drinks and kiss goodbye, this time like civilized people. - There would be conditions. - Which conditions? No penetration... whatsoever. That makes things harder. Besides, I need the money this week. It's a very short time. You will have to work a lot. No, that's the third condition. A single day, a single job, in the morning. It's the only time my husband's not at home. He could get suspicious if I go out more. It's very difficult. A lot. 7,000 euros with no penetration, one day, one job... It's the only way. How many hours do you have? From 8 to 15. Do you know who Oliver Zoco is? - What to you think? - I don't know him personally. But you know what he does, don't you? - What do you think? - Nothing. I can convince him to arrange something for this week, in the morning. - But you have to go. - I'm going. If it goes along, I'll text you the night before... ...with the place and hour they'll pick you up. - I'll give you my number. - I already have it. I like your new scar. I'm going to the bathroom. "Hidden number: Humilladero Square. 11:00" - Excuse me. - Yes? If you ever need a ride, this is my card. - It will be a pleasure. - Thanks. - Welcome Barbara. - Thank you. I'm Adela, Oliver's assistant. Thank you for coming. Thanks to you. Come with me please. You can wait in this room. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you Adela. You're welcome. First of all, I would like to thank you for coming to our house. Thanks to you. Ada's told me wonders, but I have to confess that... ...despite not having met you, I'd heard of you a long time ago. I'm glad to have you with us. Thanks. - Do you like bullfights? - No, not much to be honest. Neither do I. But it's funny that Spain is the country where bullfighting is most popular. Do you know why Spain is in perennial clash? Because we don't know whether we're a rational or an emotional country. The Nordic countries, for example, are cerebral countries. Still, Arabs or Latinos have accepted their passionate side with no complex or guilt. They all know which side dominates. We Spaniards are in a balance hanging right in the middle. That's the way we are. Like bullfights. And what are bullfights? The depiction of the struggle between instinct and technique. Between emotion and reason. We have to accept our instincts and learn to handle them... ...like if they were a bull, so they don't destroy us. This is exactly what we offer our clients. Could you remove your clothes, please? You're very beautiful. Thanks. Adela. Open it, please. I want you to memorize that word. Done. Excuse my insistence, but according to my experience with other women... ...it's likely you'll forget it when you enter the room. And it's very, very important that you remember that word. Once inside, that's the word halting all, whenever you want it to stop. Remember. Everything will stop only when you pronounce that word. There's no other way. I want you to understand this. I get it. The longer you take to say it, the more money you will make. Do you understand the process? Perfectly. Return the card to Adela. Are you ready? Then step into the next room, please. I'm Barbara. I got the money. It's 14 bills, 500 euros each. - Yes. - Good. I want you to go to the library in Puerta de Toledo... ...and leave the money inside the Spanish Constitution book. You want me to leave 7,000 euros in a public library? Nobody is taking that book. As you want. Put the money in an envelope and leave it in the gap at the book spine... ...not between the pages. Do you understand? Yes. I have your husband's number. If I sense anything funny, I'll call him. Ok. Thanks. Alicia, supper's ready. Cream of vegetables? - Don't you feel like it? - Well... This is different, it has a special ingredient. It tastes like always. You have to keep on eating to feel the difference. I don't know. Did you get the grade on your therapy work? Not yet, I think next week. If you feel bad you don't have to go to school. No, I'm fine. Dad. Tell me. I want to tell you something. What is this? The special ingredient. "Look inside the microwave." "Look under the salad." "Look behind the sofa." Do you want to try it? Later. - Anything wrong? - What? - Looking for something? - No. - Is everything ok, darling? - Yes, I love the dress. - Are you sure? - I'm very happy. Hello. What are you having? A beer. - No, better a liqueur coffee. - Very well. I'm having another. What do you want? I need more money. - No. - How come no? I can't, I don't have any more. Yes you can, your husband is loaded. I don't have any money, understand? I didn't ask my husband for the money I gave you. I can't ask him. You said you weren't bothering me again, and I fulfilled my part of the deal. It's not so easy. You're a son of a bitch. I'm a son of a bitch. It's you cheating your husband. I told you I didn't find you disgusting, and it's true. I feel pity for you. You'll have your money. How much? 20,000. For the day after tomorrow. That day I'll go to the library, and I want it at the same spot. Do you understand? Understood. - Barbara. - Hello. - What time is it? - Noon. I just went to bed. I need to ask you for something. It's urgent. - How urgent? - Very. I'll hear you on one condition. - Which one? - Buy churros. - Do you want some? - No. Did I say porras or churros? - What? - Did I say porras or churros? - Churros. - Really? Yes. - I think I told you porras. - You told me churros, Ada. - I didn't expect to see you again. - I didn't expect to come back. What are you doing here then? I need more money. Gee... How much more? 20,000. - With the same conditions? - No. - Then maybe. - I need it for the day after tomorrow. That's utterly impossible. I'm very sorry. I'm willing to go through the black lizard door. What are you talking about? The door with a black lizard drawing at Oliver's. I don't know what door you're talking about. You know it, Ada. Is there a napkin? What have you heard about that door? - Likely the same things as you. - I don't think so. Not really. - Go home, Barbara. - No. Go home. Call me later and we can arrange three or four jobs for next week. I beg you. I'm begging you too. I don't want to get mad. I'm going. If you don't arrange it, I'm going alone. The only difference is you'll lose your share. I don't care. I don't want to have anything to do with this. - Is it final? - Yes. Thanks. Barbara, don't do it. I beg you. Hello? Hello, I'm Barbara, the girl you took to Oliver Zoco's house the other day. - Hello Barbara, how do you do? - I'm fine. Do you want me to take you anywhere? No. Actually I wanted to ask you some other thing. Really? Tell me. I'd like to ask you about the black lizard door at Oliver's. What do you want to know? I wanted to know... I want to go through that door tomorrow. Hello? The driver will be at your front door tomorrow at 11:00. Thanks for arranging this. Good morning. Good morning. - How are you? - Fine. Well, this is our last session. I'd like to thank you. It's been very easy to work with you. And I wish you the best from now on. Thank you very much. I'd like you to evaluate your progress... ...and to tell me in which areas you think you've improved... ...and what you should keep working on outside. To be honest, I still have a lot to improve. It takes time. Indeed I have something for you. - And this? - A present. You shouldn't have... - Thank you. - You're welcome. Damian, you're a good man. Don't forget it. Thanks. I want to ask you something. Sure, tell me. I don't know how difficult it will be. We'll see. What is it? I don't want to go out tomorrow. What do you mean? I don't want to go out of jail. I want to stay here. I don't know for how long, but I know I'm not ready. Would you like to explain it to me? I thought of hitting a guard or an inmate. But I don't want to waste all this time we've worked together. That's why I'm asking you personally. And to avoid hurting others. I don't get it. Why don't you want to go out? Because I'm afraid. What are you afraid of? Of meeting Barbara again. FLESH It's 6.20. Thank you. How do you say "thank you" in Chinese? And this. Excuse me, are you alright? Are you alright? Listen. She was in the stairs near the landing... ...and I've brought her home so I could help her. I don't know if it was the right thing to do. She's conscious but in bad shape. Really bad. Yes, send it as soon as possible. Thanks. The ambulance will come right away. Damian... Thank you. You look very old. Can you hand me my bag, please? I need a favor. What do you want? Could you return this book to the library in Puerta de Toledo? The Constitution. Could you return it? I don't think you should worry about this right now. Please. The ambulance will arrive soon, you'll see. It's very important, Damian. Tomorrow I will do it. Damian, help me. What else do you want me to do? Give me your hand. If we need anything else, we'll contact you. OK. - Thanks a lot, good night. - Good night. Hello? - Is it Damian? - Yes, I am. Who is this? Sorry to bother you. I'm Alfredo, Barbara's husband. The woman you helped last night. Ah, good morning. I got your number from the hospital. I've already talked to the police. See, I found your wife in the landing... No, don't worry. I've called to thank you. Thank you very much. Well, I did as anybody else would have. - Thank you very much. - You are welcome. How's your wife? She just started talking. - Did she tell you what happened to her? - No. And the doctors? Doctors say... They don't know anything. The first thing she said is that she wanted to talk to you. She wants to thank you. Well... She has to start talking. I need you to talk to her. About anything. I'd be very grateful. It will only be for a few minutes. - Ok, don't worry. Thanks. We're at the San Gabriel Hospital. Room 239. I'm here. Ok, see you. See you. - Damian, isn't it? - Yes. - I'm Alfredo. Thanks for coming. - You're welcome. I'm going to the cafe. Do you want anything? No, thank you. I'll be back soon, my love. I told you before but thank you very much. Don't mention it. Sit down. I'm fine here. Sit down, please. - Have you met my husband? - He didn't know me. - I've never talked to him about you. - Better. - Did you return the book? - Yes. You're still very tender. You've always seen me that way. Because it's true. You're very tender and a good man. You're my guardian angel. You were on my doorstep. I would've helped anybody. It was the only place I could go to. How did you know where I live? Barbara, I have to go. I really hope you get well soon. Don't go. What do you want? I need something else. What else do you want, Barbara? I want to tell you what happened. No, tell your husband or the police. I only trust you. I'm sorry for what happened but, please, let me go. I beg you. Ok, go. I'm sorry. It's ok. Thank you. I want to tell you. - You must tell the police. - I can't. - Why can't you? - Because, I'm afraid. What are you afraid of, Barbara? Swear to me you won't tell anybody. What has happened to you? A man. A man has done that to you. Has a man done that to you, Barbara? Why? How could he? Did he rape you? Who? I didn't know him, only by sight, at the library. He started harassing me. I don't know, I think he followed me... Enough, please. Drop it. How does he look like? I'll be damned! Pitagoras! - How are you? - What's up? What are you doing here? - I've come to see you. - Really? When were you released? - It'll be one year next month. - One year, my god. Come in, please. How good to see you, really. You know what? Last year I got the school degree, and now I can help my brother-in-law with his stuff. I'm good at numbers. It's true, you were good. - Do you mind? - No. A lot of memories are coming back to me, and I have a feeling like ten years or more have gone by. And ever since I went out I'm clean, you know? I don't take anything but joints and sometimes a bit of MDMA. But in short, nothing, clean. What about Rat and Cao? I left them there working on their degrees like you. You've always been a great teacher. I always tell my sister and brother-in-law how much you helped me in prison. - Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. No, thanks. We couldn't convince my father at first, but now he smokes 15 a day, relying on marijuana for pain relief. - You know, he has prostate cancer. - I'm sorry. Pepo... ...remember what you told me when you passed your first exam in prison? No. You told me to look for you if I needed anything after getting released. Now I need something. "The moon kisses your pure tears" "Like a promise of good fortune" "People call you Fire Girl" "And they are letting you die of thirst" "Oh Fire Girl, oh Fire Girl" "Inside my soul I have a fountain" "So your guilt bends to drink" "Oh Fire Girl, oh Fire Girl" "Woman that cries and suffers" "I offer you salvation" "I offer you salvation" "Affection is blind" "I'm a good and sympathetic man" "Come on, come with me, Fire Girl" See you later. Hello. - What are you having? - A liqueur coffee. Right away. Thanks. Good evening. - What would you like? - Rioja, if you have. - I have the house Rioja. - That's fine. - Thanks. - To you. I'm out for a smoke. - Excuse me, do you have a light? - Yes, of course. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Do you know who's playing? - Pardon? - I asked if you knew who's playing. - No, not really. - You don't like football. - Not much. A mortal sin in this country. - What about you? - I like to watch it. I like to watch the NT games, but I don't follow any club. I like sports, but not the business Few things are not businesses anymore. I remember when I used to teach, a few years ago, that I coached the school's futsal team. It was nothing, but they had a good time, which was the point. Nowadays they only want to be famous and have a top model for a girlfriend. To become an athlete comes last. - Did you used to teach? - Yes. - What field? - Mathematics. I was literature teacher. - So you're a teacher as well. - Was, now I'm unemployed. The state of Education is terrible. Terrible. I'm going in. Thank you. Do you mind if I sit there? - Sure, go ahead. - Thanks. - Damian, please to meet you. - Luis. - Are you from the neighborhood? - No, I've come to visit a friend. - Do you live here? - Yes, all my life. - It's a nice quarter, isn't it? - Yes it is. Cheers. How long it's been since you worked as a teacher? Like... half a year. It happened suddenly due to cutbacks. My God, I don't know where we're going. Education, which is the cornerstone of a critical society... Well, which politician is interested in a critical society nowadays? I'm telling you, no one. I think the education degree should be tougher. It's a too responsible and risky job. Too risky. I myself haven't enjoyed an easy life, you know? I've been in jail. I've lived for ten years with murderers, pedophiles, rapists... But I assure you that the only time I've felt real terror was in class... ...facing a 12-year-old girl. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, because you know that girl too. Her name is Barbara. Don't do anything stupid. I have a gun in my pocket. Barbara has fully updated me. You're going to do whatever I tell you, just like that. Bitch! Very polite. As I've told you, I've been in prison once. It was precisely for helping Barbara, indeed. A long time ago. That's another story. Kipling? When she told me what you'd done to her, I thought of many things to do with you. In every one of them you ended up dead and me back in prison. And I'm not fit for that anymore. So then, I thought of something. Look, I'm taking the gun out of my pocket and put it on the table. What I want you to do is to take the gun and kill me. Are we clear? I want you to kill me in front of those two people. If you warn the waiter, the police comes and I step out alive through that door... ...I guarantee you and your family, if you have it, will die sooner or later. Ten years in prison are enough to meet people... ...who wouldn't charge me that much to do me this favor. Barbara doesn't want the rape to be known. But that doesn't keep you from spending a few years in prison for murder. Rape? I didn't rape that woman. How dare you to deny it! I don't understand anything. You raped and ruined her, and I'm going to ruin your life, that's all. No, that's not true. She slept with me because she wanted to. - What are you saying? - She slept with me because she wanted to. - I blackmailed her, but I never hurt her. - You blackmailed her? We slept together and I recorded it. I threatened her to show her husband the record in order to ask her for money. But I haven't raped her. Did you record it? How? I recorded the sound on my cell phone. It's all there. - Does her husband know? - No. At least not by me. - Barbara slept with you! - Yes. Barbara cheated her husband to sleep with you! Yes. Wait...! Don't move! Turn around. Turn around! Hello. Luis, your father... ...your father has asked me... ...to bring him his cell phone to the bar. Is it that one? Well, that's it. Thanks. Turn around. Turn around, don't look at me. Don't look at me! Don't look at me! Hello. Hello. Where's your husband? He's gone home. I've settled everything. You're my guardian angel. That man won't bother you again. Or blackmail you. Don't you give it to me? I can't. Why can't you? Because I don't have it.
