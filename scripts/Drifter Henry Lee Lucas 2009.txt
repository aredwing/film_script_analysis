I might have stretched the truth sometimes, but I did kill Becky. [gasps] [man vocalizing] [vocalizing] You're just like your mama. You thought you was different, but you ain't. Henry? What-- [grunts] You said you loved me. [D.A. Farino] Let's say you did. Why? Why'd you do that? 'Cause I love her. Friday around midnight  Got nothin' to kill but time  Little voices in my head keep whisperin' "homicide"  And my baby's driving me to drink  I can't listen to her I can't think  I steal a police car but I don't drive  Well, I crash the car I'm lucky to be alive  Well, I stumble home Fall through the door  I end up passed out on the floor  When I come to I'm in a pool of gin and blood  Oh, I can't remember what it is I've done  Oh, is this real Is this a dream  Nightmares in my bloodstream  [Becky] I don't think you're old, He Let's look at it this way. If you live to be a hundred, you ain't even halfway through your life yet. Criminals don't live that long. Henry ain't gonna live that long. He's a drunk and a killer. Hey, man, don't you talk that way about me. I ain't no killer. Some people got it comin ', that's all. Like that guy over there. You see him? He's wavin' us down like I got nothin' better to do. I know exactly what you mean. What b-be-- What, because his car broke down means that we gotta stop goin' where we gotta go? Whoa-ho-ho! [laughing] That boy had it comin', gettin' in our way and all. Don't nobody mess with bad, bad Henry Lee Lucas. Where are we goin', anyway? Don't matter. We're just goin'. We're goin' where the road ends. That's so romantic. Ain't Henry romantic, Uncle Ottis? It's just like that movie , A Racecar Named-- Named-- - Aw, bullshit. You never seen that movie. - Ah, I don't remember. I seen it! Fine. It's decided. We're goin g to the movies. - [gleeful squeal] - [chuckles] [woman on screen whimpering] Shit, it's that easy? Oh, come on! Give him what he deserves! Shh! [woman on screen sobbing] Kill those bitches! Shh! I said kill 'em! - [man on screen] I just wanted you to know that I love you. - Quiet! -That's all. - Hey, buddy. Why don't you just shut the hell up? I'm getting sick and tired of this shit. [man on screen] ...you treated me like a fucking loser! It ain't nothin'. Don't pay any attention to that jerk-off. [man] Hey, now why don't you guys just take this shit outside. We're trying to watch a movie here. And I'll prove it to you! I'll prove it to every last fucking one of you! [woman on screen] I'm not that-- I-- [man on screen] Bitch, you're so lucky right now. Oh, you're so lucky right now. Would you knock it off! You're all the same. You're all the fucking same. You're all a bunch of liars. - Lying to me. - [gagging] Lying to me my whole life. Lying! Lying! My whole life filled with lies from you bitches! [Ottis laughs] Henry, where are you going? Henry, I liked that movie! [woman on screen] Please, I'll do whatever you want. Just let me go. Oh, you're not like them. You're not like the others? No? - I just want to see my mom. - Bullshit. [screaming] Shh... [sniffs] Leaving so soon? [laughing] - [muffled screaming] -[man on screen howling] [muffled screaming continues] Henry Lee, that is the last time I let you take me out of a movie early, and I liked that one, and I'm mad at you. Oh, shut up. Come on. It wasn't that good. - I liked it. - You did? - Yeah. - What'd you like about it? I didn't like it that much. Well, I never get to go to the movies, and, um, uh-- I don't know, but it was good. We'll go again some other time. You always say that. Well, then I say it again. - You want some? - [Ottis grunts] Fuck. - You're gonna like-- - Too sour! You'll like it. In time, you will. Who wants her? Don't be givin' her to me, Uncle Ottis. Looks like she's all yours, then, Henry. She ain't movin'. [Ottis ] Nah. She dead? Still breathing. She mighty pretty, though. She kinda look like you. Ain't I prettier than her, Henry? Oh, damn, you the prettiest girl in the whole wide world. Come on. You'll make love to me under the stars tonight? I'll do better than that. None of you lovebirds want her? - Uncle Ottis? - Uh-huh. She's makin' noises. I may as well go ahead and chop her up. Get rid of the evidence. Yeah. Ah! No! No! No! No, don't! No, help! - [Ottis laughs] - Help! No! No! - No! Please stop! - [Becky giggling] No! No! [wailing] No! No! No! No! No! [screams] [grunts] Let's go over this again. You parked down here, dragged her body out of the car up this embankment here. I-- That's right, Sheriff, I dragged the body up here and that's when I-- I killed her and I had sex with her corpse. Henry... this has been going on for a long time, and I never asked you the question-- It's all right, Sheriff. The newsmen ask me all the time. I just don't know what to say. I just don't like having sex with the live ones. It's just not interesting to me. I enjoy it more when they ain't talkin'. You boys know what I'm talkin' about, right? - [chuckles] - Yeah. Boys... think it's time to, uh, call the forensics team. You boys tell 'em that you'll find some bones down there . Some clothing, too. Sheriff? What's up, Henry? I don't know. It might be too much to ask. Go ahead and ask. Ask away, Henry. Well, right before I killed that young girl, we were gonna have a milkshake. This reminded me that I haven't had a milkshake in a long while. Just wondering if I could have a milkshake before we go back to the prison. A milkshake? Mm. Sure, Henry. Ain't no big deal. You earned it, confessing to all those crimes and all. Hey, boys, we're goin' for milkshakes! So you started in Wasilla, and then you said you went to Alabama. - Mm-hmm. - So where did you go from there? Uh, Lubbock. Right here. - Lubbock? - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. - You sure it was Lubbock? - Mm-hmm. - Don't you think you would' stopped in Dallas first? If Henry says it was Lubbock, it's Lubbock. I apologize, sir. Let's give Henry the benefit of the doubt. He's been hard pressed to regurgitate a lot of information over these last three weeks. I'm sure it's very stressful. I appreciate that, Sheriff, your understanding and all. But, actually, Officer Miner just reminded me of a murder I must've committed when I was under the influence of drugs. Well, that's good, Henry. Dan, hand me that file. Young girl... missing for three years. They found her-- Now, see, I do remember now. I, uh, I strangled her and tossed her off the side of the road right outside of town. It says here you stabbed her. Well, I stab them after I strangle them. Trying to throw you boys off a bit. [phone rings] Texas Rangers, this is Deputy Miner. Sheriff, this looks like it's for Henry. Go ahead, Henry. Hello, this is Henry. Uh, Sheriff, this is a news reporter, wants to know some personal information. Give me that. - Who is this? -Phil Johnson, journalist. How in the fuck you get this number? Huh? Who gave you the number? I could arrest you just for callin' it. No disrespect, Sheriff Larabie, but your brother gave me the number. Said you'd have no problem with me interviewing Mr. Lucas. - My brother? -Yes, sir. What paper you write for? Best paper in Texas. Dallas Star,sir. I'll tell you what. I'll let you talk to Henry as long as you report about me and my Rangers and the professional job they's doin' about the case and all. Certainly, sir. You have my word. I will arrest you if I don't see at least one paragraph about my Rangers. - Henry. - Yes, sir? Just an old friend of mine wants to ask a few questions. - Hello? - Go ahead and sit down. Yes? This is Henry. Mr. Lucas, I've got a lot of facts about you currently, but I wanted to learn more about you personally-- how you became a, uh... Um, a serial murderer? Oh... yeah, I guess you could say that. A serial murderer. [Henry] It all started with my mother. Henry! Henry, where are you, boy? You get your sorry self back here! You ain't finished your chores! Henry! Henry! Henry Lee Lucas! Henry, I know you hear me calling you. Henry Lee Lucas, you little turd. I'm gonna find you, boy! Gonna wish I hadn't found you. You heard me calling you, boy. You ain't finished your chores. Out here in the woods goofin' off. Come on. You ain't doin' nothin' like you supposed to. Your papa ain't got no legs. I gotta do everything around here. Gonna try to teach you how to be a man. I got better things to do than to be looking for you in the woods. - Ow, Mama! Ow! - You hush up. You come when I call you, boy. go. Ow, Mama. Please let me You hush up! Please! Ow! Oh! Hey! Hey! - What do I have to do to make you learn? - No, Mama! No! Boy, don't you ever be comin' up against me, you hear me? Now, I gots me a job comin' in three days, and I don't need no trouble from you or your brothers or your sisters, you hear me? Boy, your mama's talkin' to you! Do you hear me? Boy? You didn't have to bring me no flowers. I know, but I wanted to make a good first impression. - [laughing] - I been lookin' forward to this. Where's your wife? Come on, Mr. Hennesy. I knows you're married. You ain't got no reason to come see me if you ain't married. It's okay. I mean, you got that man stuff runnin' through your veins. Ain't that right? Sometimes... you just need the soft touch of a woman. [laughing] Don't be scared. Viola's gonna take good care of you. So... what? So where's your wife? She went down south to visit her sister in Charleston. Oh, well, ain't that good. She don't need to know everything you're doin', does she? No, ma'am. Whoa, oh. Now, Mr. Hennesy, it ain't time for no kissin'. You come this way. Our lesson today is on Abraham Lincoln. He's our 16th president of the United State-- - [laughing] - Children, what are you laughing at? Mr. Lucas. Why are you dressed that way? My mama dressed me this way. - [laughing] - Quiet. Quiet. Well, why would she dress you like a girl? She says that I ain't good enough to be a boy. I said, "Quiet." I said, "Quiet." Viola? Viola. I think you need to take Henry to see a doctor. The boy gonna lose his eye , you don't take him to see no doctor. Vee! Ain't you listening to me? The boy ain't gonna go see no doctor. We ain't got no money. What doctor's gonna see him if we ain't got no money to pay for it? Yeah, well, Dr. Andrews, he took care of me when I had my accident. If it weren't for him, I'd be dead right now. Well, you know what? That might not be so bad! One less mouth for me to feed around here. You ungrateful whore. Who you talkin' "ungrateful"? Ungrateful for what? For all you done for me? For forcin' me to live in squalor? Take care of these kids by myself? You get drunk and you go off and you get runned over by a train! I been taking care of your bony ass since we first met. Might've gone and made somethin' of myself you ain't got knocked up every time we screwed. [groans] Viola, stop it! - Viola! - [Viola mutters angrily] Stop it, Viola! Henry? You awake, son? Here. Come on. Hold still, now. There. No, no, don't rub your left eye. Don't wanna get an infection, now. - Are you the man who-- - Yes. I'm the man who took you to the hospital. But how? Well, it doesn't matter how. What matters now is that we make sure that you don't get an infection. I can't see. I can't see anything out of my eye. Henry... your left eye is gone. Now, unfortunately , that stick went right through it, and there was nothing I could do to save it. I'm very sorry. But don't you fret. I got something for you. What is it? Open it up. That is your new eye. Can I see with it? No, no, I'm sorry. It's not a magic eye. It's more like a placeholder. But I guarantee you, that nobody will be able to tell that you're missing an eye. - What's it made of? - Glass. Like a marble? I got lots of marbles. Well, now you got one that will go everywhere with you. Here. Let me show you how you put it in. Just hold still. You just gently lift up that top eyelid. And we just put it straight back. Just like... that. And then you use the lower eyelid to hold it right there in place. Okay. Now let me show you. You see? Now, that discoloration there, that's just gonna go-- Are you finished, Roy? Yes, Viola. He's just about as good as new. "New"? Heck. You ain't got but one eye. That ain't "new." Well, least you didn't lose no legs like your daddy. Shoot. You've used enough of this man's good time. Git yourself. Mr. Hennesy. I'm sure that my insurance will be covering this bill fully, right? Yes, ma'am. Your bill is paid in full. Thank you. [Henry] I don't know how I got there. I just done woke up! Don't be lyin' to me, boy. I'm your mama! You're playing tricks on me. I'm your mother! What I say goes in this house, boy! [distorted] Little shit. Stupid little boy! Who you think you are? Show you who's boss in this house! Get up! Get up! Get up! You little shit! Coward! I'm trying to make you a man! [man] Tell me about your mama. Mama didn't like no one. She's the reason you kill? I can't say that she was the reason , really. Well, then what do you think it is? I can't say I really know. Uh... I just feel the urge. Why do you eat? You don't really think about it. You just eat because you're hungry, right? - Yeah, I guess. -Well, it's like that for me. Sometimes I just get hungry. [humming] [humming] [gasps] - Can I help you? - Well, ma'am, I was walking down the road and I was wondering if I could have a glass of water. There's a spigot out there in the center of the yard. - You're welcome to drink from there. - I'm no animal! I would like a glass of water. Please. I'm sorry, who are you? My name is Jack. Glass of water would be very much obliged. Well, like I said, Jack, there's a spigot outside. You're welcome to drink from there. I can't have a strange man in my house! [screams, whimpers] [grunts, groans] - [crying] - I guess right now I'm gonna need a lot more from you. [crying] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [crying] Take all the w-water you want. [crying] Where the cups at? Where the cups at? [crying] Th-Th-The-- - Cabinet? - In the cabinet. [crying] [blubbering, crying] - [growls] It doesn't work! - [shrieks, cries] You gotta let it run. - What'd you say? - You have to run the water. Oh, you got dirty pipes. Oh, I see. That's two cups now. - [water splashing] - [Henry] Oh, yeah. [gasps] Now that's much better. Yeah. [whimpering, crying] You goin' somewhere? [crying] - Huh? - [screams, cries] - Where you going? - [shrieks, gags] [Henry grunts] [Henry] Sometimes I'm just curious , you know. Feel the urge. Like the first time I done it. [Detective] And when was that? [Henry] Oh, I was 15. She was my first girlfriend. Honestly, I didn't really know how to treat a woman back then. Kinda felt awkward. Know what I mean? [Charlene] So, where you taking me, Henry? Henry Lee Lucas, where you taking me? It's a secret. I ain't telling you until we get there. But I ain't too sure my daddy'd approve of me going off with a boy. [scoffs] I'm not just a boy. I'm your boyfriend. You ain't my boyfriend. Well, at least you ain't my boyfriend yet. We ain't even held hands. - So, where you taking me? - It's a secret. But if you gotta know, it's a private place where no one can bother us. It's a beautiful place, Henry. Thought you'd like it here. We can swim in the lake just around the bend. I ain't got no bathing suit. You don't need a bathing suit. We can go skinny-dipping. - I can't do that. - Sure you can. No, I-I can't. - Why not? - 'Cause it just ain't right. 'Course it's right. Ain't nothin' righter. When you free yourself from the fig leaf, we'll be like Adam and Eve just before the apple. Come on. Take off your shirt. Take off your shirt, Charlene. Come on. It'll be fun. No, not yet. I ain't comfortable yet. [gagging] I want you. [gagging, gasping] [panting] You're trying to kill me. You're crazy! - Did it hurt? - What? 'Course it hurt. Did you enjoy that? You're insane, Henry Lee Lucas. [screams] Help me! Don't bother. We're so far out here, ain't no one gonna hear you. Please, please, don't. Finally, you're begging. I got one question for you. Will you go with me? Will you be my girlfriend? - [sobs] Let me go. - Answer me! Yes, yes! I'll be your girlfriend! I'll marry you! Just, for God's sake, let me go! I can't do that. [grunts] You bitch! Why'd you do that? [grunting] [Charlene gasping] [Anderson] Henry! Goddamn it, boy. Get your ass over here. Hey, Henry! Gotta stop drinking, Pop. [burps] It takes the pain away, boy. When you gonna see a doctor, Pop? Ain't got no money. - Where'd you get that, boy? - Stole it. You stole it? - Ain't no big deal. - Well... just don't get caught. Your mama gonna tan you alive. I'm done taking beatings from Mama. One more beating and I might just have to kill her someday. Well... just don't get caught. Jail ain't no fun, boy. Better than we get around here. Clean clothes, food. You got that right. - She inside? - Yep. She in there with your uncle Bernie. Henry. Don't you go killing your mama just yet, you hear? She might be as angry as a drunk pirate, but... I ain't too good on my own. - [Bernie] Look at you, honey. - Bernie! - Look at you! - I ain't no horse! - You look like a little filly to me! - Hey, stop-- - [knocking] - [Bernie] Oh, Jesus. What do you want, boy? Can't you see Uncle Bernie and I is having ourselves a little conversation here? [Bernie scoffs] Get the hell outta here, Bernie. Oh, Jesus. Oof. I'm gonna send that Wade from the feed shop over in Millersville on Sunday morning. Don't you be sending him on Sunday. That's God's day. Bernie, I ain't gonna be whoring for you on God's day. You be respecting the Lord, or I ain't gonna be pulling no more tricks for you. [chuckles] I'll send him first thing Monday morning. How's that? You send him tomorrow, and then you get me another man for Monday morning. Hoo-whee! Maybe I'll send that dapper banker man over from the savings and loan and have him bring his entire staff march in here for you. - How'd that be? - Get the hell outta here, you smartass. I'll see you, Miss Viola , and, uh, you, too, Henry. [clicks tongue] - What you want, boy? - Got you somethin'. [laughs] You got me somethin'? Then what the hell you waitin' on? Give it to me. You got me a present, give it to me. Where you get that? Don't matter. I said where'd you get this? I said it don't matter. It's yours. Boy, you better be tellin' me. I was gonna give it to this girl. But it didn't work out. Well, good. 'Cause you don't need no girl. Whoa! This looks good on me, don't it? - [gasps] Oh, my goodness. - Sure, Mama. Ooh, I am hot somethin' with this! Anderson! Anderson, come in here and look at my new diamond ring! [gasps] I got myself a diamond ring! Ooh! [glass breaking] Hey, boy! What's your name, son? Bernie, sir. - Bernie what? - Bernie Bottomly. That ain't your name. I know Bernie Bottomly. - Where's your ID? - Ain't got no ID. Empty your pockets. I said empty your pockets, or I'm gonna do it for you! - Where'd you get all that stuff? - Just got it. Just got it? You got about five seconds to explain to me how a scrappy little junkyard dog like you gets drugs, jewelry, and a knife. - I'm taking you in. - For what? About time I got something on you. - You can't prove nothin '! - Miller! Grab that stuff up. We're taking this punk in. All right, you boys pick up the pace. This is no six-inch pipe. This is a twelve-inch pipe. Hey, step it up. Lucas! Keep digging. Come on, now. You best keep digging, or else I'm gonna hit you upside the head with this here shovel. You best not be planning what I think you're planning. Why? What you gonna do about it? Now, here. Break these chains with me. I ain't getting involved in none of that. You two shut up. Back to work. Don't need no trouble around here, all right? Come on. Lucas, get back to work. Shut up. Yeah, shut the fuck up, man. Best not say anything, ya hear, big boy? Else I might have to kill you. You won't make it one mile. - [grunts] - Ah! Told you not to say another word! - Catch you later, boys! - [whistle blowing] - [dogs barking] - [gunshots] Good riddance. That boy ain't nothin' but trouble. [gunshots] [Reporter #1] So I understand you only did ten years for the murder of your mother. Well, I... I didn't murder my mother. It was self-defense. [Viola] That's it. I should've known you'd take us to a shit bar. Ain't no alcohol in those drinks. There was plenty of alcohol in those drinks. - Henry? Henry boy? - Yeah. Yeah. I want you to come home, Henry. I want you to come home and take care of me. Ha! Mama, Henry ain't gonna go home with you. He's got a girl. He's gonna marry her. You ain't marryin' no girl. You been away from home too long, anyway. I ain't goin' back to Virginia, Mama. You know that. Why the hell not? Because I got a warrant for my arrest, that's why, Mama. [snickers] There's warrants out for your arrest all over Michigan. Henry, you just come home to Mama. Ain't nobody gonna hurt you. You can't beat me no more, Mama. I ain't never beat you when you didn't deserve it, boy. Well, since when a six-year-old boy deserves to be beaten? Since he's a little piece of shit like you, that's when. I'm going to sleep. I've had enough of you two . I ain't-- - I ain't got time for this nonsense. - Well, go on, then! I'm goin'! [Opal] Shit... You had enough to drink tonight, Mama. It's time to stop. Boy... I ain't even got started yet! You're 64 years old, Mama. You can't drink the juice no more. I know how the hell old I am, boy! You don't tell me when I can and can't drink. You don't know the pain I been livin' in! Who do you think you are to tell me what I can do with my life, huh? I'm your mama, and I am telling you that you ain't marrying that stupid girl! - You piece of shit! - Stop, Mama! You're just a damn stupid piece of shit! She ain't worth nothin' but crap! Stupid boy! [sobs] Piece of shit. Ah! Can't control me no more, Mama. I said you can't control me no more! [Viola grunts] [Reporter #2] The jury decided it was second-degree murder, right? [Henry] Well, it don't matter what a jury thinks. She was 64, Mr. Lucas. It don't matter. She was drunk and had a weapon. [Reporter #3] So you went to jail. How'd you do in the state pen, Mr. Lucas? [Viola's voice] Don't you be comin' up against me. You hear me? You got that? Boy, your mama's talking to you. You hear me, boy? Henry! Henry! [echoes] [whistling] [whistles] Hey, Lucas. Get up. Chow time. Let's go. Hey, Lucas! - Guard! - [buzzing] When I say move, I mean move. Move! Katherine! Katherine! Code red! Code red! Let's go! Code red! [alarm blaring] Many prisoners try to get into this hospital, Mr. Lucas. They think they'll find better treatment. In many ways, they're probably right. Food is more edible, I'm sure, and, uh, well, the place is cleaner. [Viola's voice] You can't tell me when I can and when I can't drink! Excuse me, Doctor. I need you to sign this. Don't nobody tell me when I can't drink! -And you ain't marryin' no girl! - Thank you. As I was saying, many prisoners cut or otherwise harm themselves to get in here. Most do not succeed. However, your injuries are quite serious. Much worse than the usual, so we'll have to assume... that your suicide attempt was real... and proceed with treatment. You don't know the pain I'm in! Are you listening to me, Henry? I'm here to help you. Henry? I'm here to help you. - [Henry shouting] - [Viola voice] Little shit! -You ain't worth a crap. -Are you listening to me? I'm here to help you. [Viola] ...like your daddy! Henry! Henry! [echoes] Are you hearing me ? Can you hear me? Henry. [Psychiatrist] Don't worry. I'll take full responsibility. [Nurse] But we always sedate them. [heart monitor beeping] Yes, well, Mr. Lucas will be an exception. [Psychiatrist] Let's proceed. Ready? Shock. [groaning] [labored breathing] Again. - Shock. - [groaning] One more time. [moaning] Ready? Shock. [groaning] Please, no more. Oh, we must go on, Mr. Lucas. - In fact, I think we'll do another course of 16 ECTs. - No more, please. I'm not seeing the improvement I was hoping for. - You're still not... complian - Please, no more. I'm going to say that you've made progress, Mr. Lucas. A lot of progress. Medication and the EC s seem to be working. [slurred] I killed people. Yes, I know. Your mother. That's in the past. Other people. I don't remember seeing that in the report. Gonna kill again. Again... and-- That's not my prognosis, Mr. Lucas. I really don't think you have murder in you or suicide anymore. No, you're going back to the state prison. where you'll be for another ten years or so. Then you'll be paroled. After that, it's up to you. I won't be seeing you again. Motor skills will come back in time. Good luck, Mr. Lucas. Honestly, I don't even remember stabbing her. I got gashes on the back of my head and black-and-blue bruises for all the times she used to beat me. I mean, it was years of abuse. [Reporter #1] Is that a reason to kill someone? I don't know. But she pushed all the wrong buttons. [Reporter #3] So after prison, what'd you do? Drifted. "Drifted"? Yeah, just moved from place to place. You know, um, I couldn't get comfortable. Until, um... Until what? Until I met Ottis and Becky. [Reporter #2] And just how did you meet Ottis Toole? Oh, we met at a-- at a soup kitchen. Right outside of Jacksonville. [Henry] Ottis was a strange fella. - Give me some more. - Sorry, that's it. - Give me more food. - There won't be enough for everybody. I'm bigger than those guys. Give me more food. I deserve more food! - Too bad. - One bowl, one ladle. Give me more food! I'm hungry. Come on. Give me more food! I'm starvin'! Is that the best you can do? Oh, come on. What are you looking at? Huh? Go on. Take mine. I don't need no handouts. [scoffs] Well, that's what we're here for. Come on. Take it. Are you sure about that? Oh, yeah. I stole me some food from a steakhouse across the street. I'm okay. Come on. I'll give you some of mine. Let's go. [Henry] And, uh, one time he killed someone. And he shot him like a hundred and some times. It was incredible. [Reporter #1] You shot people, too. Ain't that right, Mr. Lucas? Yes, but, you see, what got to me is that... when Ottis started eating people. I mean, most of the people we'd kill, he started cutting them up and eating them. .. [Reporter #3] So you, Becky, and Ottis were like. partners in crime, traveling from state to state. Yeah, we were like Bonnie and two Clydes. I mean, just robbing, stealing, and burglarizing. As I was walking through the castle late one night  I came upon such a shocking sight  It gave me such a dreadful fright  My mommy was dancing with Frankenstein  Ah  I couldn't bear to look anymore  I shut my eyes and closed the door  But through the walls I could hear  My mommy dancing without any fear  Ah  An unlikely thing began to happen  My head started bobbing and my feet started tapping  My arms started swinging and my hands started clapping  My hips started shaking and my fingers started snapping  Oh, Mummy  The party is in full swing as you can see  Now everybody wants to dance with me  And who am I to turn and flee  When a pretty young corpse wants to boogie with me  Tappin' and slappin' and clappin' and snappin'  Tappin' and slappin' and clappin' and snappin'  When the ball was over to clear my head  I headed for the dungeon It felt more undead  I told them I was tired and going to bed  They told me to stay and dance with them instead  Tappin' and slappin' and clappin' and clappin'  And snappin'  Dancing fool  [Reporter #2] And you didn't get caught. See, being a criminal is easy. You just gotta do the crime when there's no police around. Buried in replacement skin, yeah  Travels well Time to begin, yeah  Ah, she ain't your type. Oh, but she sure is yours. I'll let you have her first. Yeah, I ain't too good with girls. She ain't a girl. She's just juicy white meat. I'll handle it. [Ottis] Hi. Hi. - Looking for a ride? - Maybe. How far you going? Just drifting. Me, too. Just drifting. What you waitin' for? Get in. - I'll take that. Don't worry about it. - Thanks. - Hi. - Hi. [engine starts] - [Ottis] So what's your name? - Jenny. Jennifer? You know what they say, don't you? One in every three men has screwed a Jennifer. Don't know what it is about girls with your name, sweetheart. [laughing] Where you headed to? Galveston, maybe. Maybe somewhere else. You sure say "maybe" a lot. Maybe I do. Do you mind? ... Ah You're a peppery one, ain't ya? I take care of myself pretty good. - [Ottis laughs] - Aw, just leave her alone. Oh! Looks like Henry likes her. I'm gonna have to pay for this ride, huh? What do you mean? You know damn well what I mean. Might just as well get it over with now. Not afraid of nothin', are you? I'm afraid of gettin' hurt. So I figure it's better I just give you what you want. I've done it before. Bet you have, sweetheart. Bet you have. Hear that, Henry? Let's give her what she thinks we want. - Henry? - Mm-hmm? [Jenny] Jesus... [Jenny grunting, whimpering] [grunting, screaming] [screaming] [screaming] [Ottis] Fuck! [Jenny screams] No! [car door closes] [engine starts] [Ottis] Well, if you wanted her, why didn't you take her? I ain't like that. [Ottis] What, then? I don't know. Just wasn't interested. You know, watching and all. It wasn't what I expected. It was fine for me, though. I like a woman on her period. Like a little blood. What's a little blood between friends? [Ottis sighs] I don't get you, man. What you need to be satisfied, boy? I get you these pumps, and you ain't right with it. You still owe me, though. - You wanna go again? - No, not yet. Well, I need to. Please, not now. Can't wait. - Please, not now. - I can't wait! No, please, not now! Let me rest a little. - Well, you can't stop me! - No! No! No! Come on! Get her! Get her! - Leave me alone! No! - Come on! Kill her! Choke her! No! Let me go! No! - [screaming] - Go on! Choke her now! - [screaming, gagging] - Damn it, kill her! Damn it, kill her! [no audible dialogue] I want her dead! I want her dead! Is she dead? Is she dead? - Come on! - [gasping, gagging] She dead? Come on! Kill her! [no audible dialogue] Come on. Get her feet. [Ottis cackles] You want one? [whistling] [dogs barking] [grunts] [whistling] [panting] [grunting] Come on, baby. Comeon. Come on. [grunts] [Henry] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Come on. You watchin' this? Come on. - [Ottis chuckles] -I'm almost done now, okay? Look at me . Look at me . [coughing] You're a good ol' boy, Henry. [Henry panting] Good ol' boy. [exhales] Yeah, man. You want some of this now? Uh-uh. You're a sick bastard. [laughing] Come on. Let's bury this bitch. Ain't workin'? - [Ottis chuckling] - Hey, don't fuck with me. Or should we just leave her here? I don't give a fuck. What you wanna do? Isn't that funny... how dead people always look like they sleepin'? Ain't nothin' to it. When you don't dream, sleepin' and dea th ain't no different. Sleep tight, baby. Sleep tight. Thanks for the memories. [kisses] [D.A. Farino] I don't wanna talk about it, and I don't wanna discuss it. Y'all just get outta my way. Uh, excuse me, Mr. Farino. Where you goin'? I have some very important business I need to discuss with the sheriff. If you want to talk to the sheriff, you need to make an appointment. The hell I do. I'm the district attorney of this county. I have every right to be in this police station. Step aside. - What the hell's this? - You tell me, Sheriff. Looks like a bunch of receipts and journal writings and, uh, - check stubs and... - That's right. What's this? All right. These circles, they indicate the locations of the crimes. Now, the contrasting triangles indicate Henry's actual location during those crimes. Now, on June 14, 1979, Henry said that he was with that girl in Oklahoma City. He was working for a roofing company in Florida I got a cancelled payroll check to prove it. Don't prove nothin'. Proves he didn't murder that girl in Oklahoma City, and if he lied about that, he's probably lying about all these other murders that he so-called "confessed to." Mr. Farino, how do you know that somebody else didn't, uh, cash that payroll check in Florida for Henry? No disrespect, Sheriff, but you got no right to ask me questions. Now, you don't have one shred of evidence that links him to that girl in Oklahoma City. We have his confession. You're gonna go on the confession of a social outcast like Henry Lee Lucas? Mr. Farino, it sounds like you don't wanna solve these murders. Of course I wanna solve these crimes. But I like to put away real murderers. I'm tired of going off on some wild-goose chase on some self-described necrophiliac. I've heard about enough of you, Mr. Farino. I'm just getting started. I'm on to you. You couldn't just go off and solve these crimes. No. You had to go out and try and be famous. Get this man outta here. Don't you touch me. I am the D.A., for God's sakes. I will have you in court before dinner! [door closes] He ain't gonna give the Texas Rangers a bad name, that's for damn sure. I know what you're doing, Mr. Lucas. I'm on you like a pig in mud. I don't know what you're talking about. Sheriff round here been real good to you, ain't he? It's good to be a cop. Get to play detective. Solve all your own murders. No, sir. I'm just trying to make up for what I've done. Come on, Henry. You claim to a murder in Louisiana when you were still a prisoner in Virginia? How'd you pull that off? Soon enough protection around here gonna be gone. You're gonna be a prisoner in with the big boys. Soon enough, you're gonna be on death row. I'm personally gonna see to that. I can't fight a legend like the Texas Rangers, Mr. Farino. Whatever's gonna happen is gonna go that way. No sense in fightin' now. Know what I mean? I can't blame you, Henry. They're fallin' for it. Ain't they? You need to leave now, Mr. Farino. You are interfering with police business. Fallin' for it. Morning, Henry. Morning, boys. Morning. Officer Dollinger, Officer Miner, I do appreciate you boys, uh, taking me for a ride and getting my cigarettes this morning. You're welcome, Henry. I guess it's the least we could do with you being so cooperative and all, Henry. Well, thank you. I really love spending time with you two. You're kind men. [Reporter #5] Well, how old was she? [Henry] Well, don't know exactly. Never really asked. Becky's an old soul. I mean, she don't seem like she was 12 or 14. Henry? Baby, we're home! Yo, I said we're home, damn it! [gasping] Henry? [Henry] Yo, Becky! Dang, come on. We're home. Where you boys been? - I know where we been. -[Ottis] None of your fuckin' business. Hey, don't be talking to my girlfriend that way. Who you talkin' to, Henry? She my niece. I'll talk to her any damn way I please. Give her some respect now! There! - [Ottis] Respect? - Yeah. What you talkin' about? She's 14 years old, fool. - Hey! - You lay off him! That's my blood you just hit! Now what the fuck you hittin' me for? I'm trying to save your honor, and you're slapping me? - What you laughin' at? - [Ottis laughing] And that's for messin' with my Henry! What are you laughing at? I ain't laughin' at you. Damn, girl, you make a funny face when you get mad. [tuning radio] You look just like your mama. [shouting] - I'm trying to hear something - What? [radio newscaster] ...Tehran has been invaded and occupied by Iranian soldiers. Those Iranians, they kidnapped our boys! ...members of the so-called Muslim Student... [Becky] What's an Iranian? I don't know. What is an Iranian? An Iranian is a person from Iran. - Mexico? -...has supported the takeover and issued a statement on local radio... Nah, girl. China. - [Ottis laughs] - Those Iranians... kidnapped our boys! They're going after the most powerful country in the world! Now, Jimmy Carter's gonna get our boys back. You'll see. Those camel jockeys! All right, sweetie pie. I'm sure that man Jimmy will take care of everything. You don't worry about nothin'. - I'm okay. - Becky'll take real good care of you. Fine. Why don't y'all go make some babies? And I'm gonna take care of me. [Becky, Henry laughing] You can't see nothin' outta that glass, can you? Ain't nothin' there to see with. That's so strange. Is that strange to you? No. I'm used to it. You see, you see in three dimensions, but I only see in two. So what does that mean? It means that you can sense how far things are better than I can. It's called "depth perception." [Becky giggles] How'd you get to be so smart, Henry Lee? [Henry] Oh, I don't know. I just like to be aware of things. [Becky] You gonna show me the world someday? [Henry] Oh, damn, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna show you everything. I'm gonna take you down to Venice, Italy. It's beautiful. They have no cars. No cars? - Mm-mm. - How they get around? Got boats. Boats? Nah, I get seasick. No, no, wait. They're not like open-water boats. These boats are called "gondolas," and there's a guy on 'em that takes you on the boat, and he sings to you. That's romantic. [giggles] That don't sound very romantic to me. Have some strange man singing at you while you're trying to get somewhere? No, it ain't nothin' like that. No, it's the most beautiful city in the world. It's built on water, you know, and it's sinking. Yeah. You're cute when you daydream. Why you like me so much, Henry Lee? 'Cause you're a wide-eyed cutie pie. - And you're refreshin'. - [giggles] Yeah. Venice, France, here we come! Oh, it's Italy. Huh? Oh, nothin'. - Hey, Henry? - Yep? Do you think Ottis will mind that we left him? No, he needed some time for himself. I don't think Ottis likes being on his own. Well, he will now, won't he? Henry? Y'all didn't tell me you're goin' nowhere. Well, ya-- ya left me? Y'all got up... and left me? You know I can't read! [mutters] Henry! Okay, Henry. [chuckles] [Reporter #6] So where did you and Becky go once you left Ottis? [Henry] Well, we ended up in Stoneburg, in Texas. At a commune called The House of Prayer. You're not saying anything. It's all just lies. There's nothing left to say. [Henry] I ain't lyin' this time. [D.A. Farino] How do I know that? [Henry] Well, I might have stretched the truth sometimes, but I did kill Becky. -[D.A. Farino] Let's say you did. - Henry? Why? Why'd you do that? 'Cause I loved her. - Henry. - Yeah. [giggles] Why, Henry Lee, you look like you actually know what you're doing in there. Well, you know me. I can pretty much fix anything. Why don't you come have a pop with your honey? In a minute. I got you a couple. Figured you was thirsty. I said in a minute. Henry, I been thinkin'. About what? About my ma and pa. About my family. - What about 'em? -Just how much I miss 'em. I mean, I love my life with you, but it might be nice to see 'em again sometime. I is your family. Better start forgetting about 'em, all right? Well, they're still my blood. I remember some pretty good times with 'em. Oh, yeah? Like when your daddy raped you? How 'bout when your mama beat you so bad you couldn't walk for three weeks? There ain't no reason bringin' that up now. How 'bout when your Uncle Ottis, uh, stripped you naked and tried to sell you to the farmer next door? Is that the kind of family you're talkin' about? Maybe they's changed. Maybe things'll be different if I come back all grown up. Goddamn it! Son of a bitch! All right! Let's go back to Florida so you can see what kind of lowlife family you really have! Maybe then you're gonna give me some sorta respect! - I don't wanna go on account of it bein' like that. - I'll take you back to Florida! Now get in! - I said get in! - Henry, please, not like that! Get in the fuckin' car! Do you think I'm gonna sit back and watch you wonder? I'm gonna take you back to your piece-of-shit family. [engine starts] [tires screeching] [Henry] Stop cryin'! [crying] Gonna make me crash! I told you I hate your cryin'! Now, stop cryin', I said ! Stop cryin'! You just get me home! Get me home to see my family! You ain't got no family. I's your family. You don't know how to treat a girl. You ain't my family till you marry me, and I ain't gonna marry you no more! We're goin' to Italy. You're gonna marry me when you turn 16. No, I ain't. I ain't gonna marry you no more! [wailing] [wailing, screaming] Get out. Get out. Come on. Come on! - Get up! Who's your daddy now, huh? - You ain't my daddy! And you ain't never gonna be my husband! All that talk about Venice and seein' the world! - You ain't shit, Henry Lee- - - [Henry grunts] You're just like your mama. You thought you was different, but you ain't. [whimpering] [grunts] You said you loved me. I do love you. [groans] [Henry] She had to die in that moment. I couldn't just let her walk away. Of course you could. There's a million things you could've done, but you took matters into your own hands and decided to play God. I am God, Mr. Farino. Can't you see that? I decide when people live or die. I decide their fates. That makes me God. That's a God complex. You're the devil, Mr. Lucas. You killed a defenseless girl. Shouldn't even been around her to begin with. - She was my soul mate. - Young enough to be your daughter! Age don't matter. What'd you do with the body? Where is it? She's in a lot of different places. What's that mean? It means that I chopped her up into nine pieces and buried her all over Texas. No one will ever make her whole again. I've had enough of you, Mr. Lucas. See, Mr. Farino, you judges and policemen, attorneys, you all are a bunch of pigs. I already made a farce outta the Texas Rangers. Might as well take everybody else down with it. Come on, Henry. You and I both know the only ones you killed was Becky and your mama. All the rest are just lies. You know, I was wondering when someone was gonna get wise to this. Mr. Farino, I confessed to three thousand murders, seven days a week for two and a half years. So you admit to lying? No, I'm just saying that no one wants to hear the truth. You see, I am more famous than Elvis Presley. Now he was supposed to be a big shot, but I think I'm bigger than him. And I think I'm bigger than- - what's his name? Adolf Hitler? I think I was gonna beat him because every time they brought in a murder case in I was accepting it no matter what. You see, I was a king. I had everything a man could possibly want. I had that. I had a color television. I didn't have that before. I had a cable TV. I didn't have that before. I had all kinds of food and stacks of cartons, and that's comin' from nothin'. And me and Larabie, we was real close. We was like brothers who would do things anywhere, anyplace. Day or night. I've had enough of this. Guard! See, Mr. Farino, you boys gonna be talking about me for a long while, even when I's gone from this Mother Earth. You'll see. You'll see. Friday around midnight  Got nothin' to kill but time  Little voices in my head keep whisperin' "homicide"  And my baby's driving me to drink  I can't listen to her I can't think  I steal a police car but I don't drive  Well, I crash the car I'm lucky to be alive  Well, I stumble home Fall through the door  I end up passed out on the floor  I split my baby's head wide open  I split my baby's head wide open  I split my baby's head wide open  Just to watch it bleed  When I come to I'm in a pool of gin and blood  Oh, I can't remember what it is I've done  Oh, is this real Is this a dream  Nightmares in my bloodstream  I split my baby's head wide open  I split my baby's head wide open  I split my baby's head wide open  Just to watch it bleed  I split my baby's head wide open  I split my baby's head wide open  I split my baby's head wide open  Just to watch it bleed  Just to watch it bleed
