Keith, the whole town is behind you. We're with you. Okay, there you go. Bob, hang on. The kids don't want you to leave without saying goodbye. I would never forget something that important. Come here, you guys. Pink? Whatever that color was looked good. There he is. What? Who? Don't look at him. - Oh, Aaron. Can you, like, smell him from 100 yards now or what? Bet he's going to Shane's party tonight. Yeah, so? Well, we have to get into that party. Who do you know who can get us into it? I know. Tabitha Lienart wants to know if she can come to Shane's party and bring Daisy. Ew. They're sophomores. It's New Year's Eve for everyone, sophomores too. Whatever. It's Shane's house. You should ask him. I'll ask Ryan. Hey, sweetie. You hungry? I can whip you up some French toast. No, thanks. I had some cereal, so... Wow, that is really good. Yeah? Didn't you have a history paper due before Christmas? I'll get to it. Jordan's coming over to help me with it. I think getting good grades sounds like a heck of a New Year's resolution. Ryan, what's up, man? Yeah, dude, that's totally cool. Yeah. Oh, I think Grace already put it on Facebook. It's gonna rock tonight. It's gonna be so awesome, right? Later, man. All right, catch you later. You wouldn't be getting rid of us? Damn it, you figured me out. Okay, ready. I'm ready. Bob, good luck in the big race. I was looking forward to kicking your ass. Hey, have a margarita for me down in Cabo. Bye, Trudy. Have fun. Bye, Katy. Happy New Year. You coming to Daddy's race? - Yeah. Good. Go strike fear in your competition. I would, if I had any competition. Smart-ass. Go. Bye. All right, we'll see you at the finish line. All right! Go! Oh. There. A friend indeed. I smelled coffee, but I didn't dare miss the finish. At least we know he'll finish. Excuse me, miss. Yes, sir, can I help you? I wanted you to know those are real nice buns. Oh, really? Well, you can look, but you can't touch. Hey. Angie. What's happening? Aaron. No. What you got here? What? Come on. Go get your own. Yo, yo, yo, the great Keith Moore, gracing us with his presence. Can I have your autograph? No. Did you know our buddy Keith broke the California high school record for most touchdowns in a single game? Attaboy. Thank you very much. Go, Daddy! Daddy! What a ride. Best race time ever. Rees Harbor's own former triathlon champion, and by the way, one hell of a good lawyer, Mr. Robert McIntosh. Hey, buddy. Yeah, buddy! Yeah! Hey, I'll meet you outside. Okay. Boo! Oh, my God. Hi. Is this how you see me? Yeah. Ew. I don't need to see tongue. Keith wants me to go to Shane's to make Jell-O shots. Give me a ride? Yeah, sure. Yeah. Oh, my God, Ryan. Tell your mom you need a new ride for graduation. No, I like the way it rumbles. Seriously? You wanna be seen in a hunk of junk? Hey, ladies. You need a lift? Not from you. Oh, come on. Come give us a kiss. - Ew. Get lost, dude. What the hell is your problem? What are you gonna do about it? - Ryan. - If you don't knock it off, I'm gonna tell my friend to kick your ass. He's Keith Moore. Man, this is a waste of time. Let's go. You gonna hide behind your girlfriend, man? I was taking care of it. Whatever. They're gone. Who cares? Hey. What? It's no big deal, okay? Okay. Ryan. Oh, nice. Jordan, can you grab the fridge? Yeah. Hey, Keith, Aaron. Thank you. Yo, Shane, where's the tub at? Right over there, dumb-ass. Dumb-ass? Dumb-ass. What took you guys so long? We were looking for those morons you said hassled you. What? Why didn't you call me, man? - You had your chance. Like your scrawny ass would be much help in a fight anyway. Shut up. I'll fight you. He's cute when he looks all feisty-- I'm messing with you. You can be the one to tap the keg. No, he's gotta take me home first. What? We'll be back in a while. You're lucky. I was about to pull my kung fu moves on you guys. Kung fu. See you guys in a bit. Bye. See you, Ryan. See you, Jordan. See you, Ryan. You look sexy when you get out of the shower. Smells good. Me or the soup? Needs a little-- A little cayenne. Well, the kids are completely sucked into that movie. Oh, really? I think that we should take advantage of this window. I don't think we have a lot of time. I think we should make time. You think? Okay, let's go. Mom? Ugh. - Where's Dad? - Mommy? You or me? Ha-ha-ha. Okay, fine, I'll go. I love you. I love you too. I'm gonna go get changed. Oh. Hey, there's Aaron. I got suspended for four days. You guys. This. - I know. By the way, you're welcome. Down the hatch. Thank you. Oh, yeah. That's pretty good. Nice. Yeah, how can we help you? Shane invited us. Really? Yeah. - Okay. Jell-O shots? - Shoot it. Yo, Keith. Hey. Yes. Bring it on. - Welcome back. Whoo! - Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Hi. Sorry we're late. I couldn't find a spot there. Don't worry. It looks like Shane's having himself a little party, eh? Heh. A little party? For me? Yes. Nice ride today, buddy. Thanks. Yay! Come on in. Katy, you look gorgeous. You too, honey. Beautiful. Hello. She always does. Sandra, I love that dress. Thanks. It's a new line I'm carrying at the shop. You should check it out. Uh-huh. All right, everybody in here. All right, to a kick-ass New Year. Senior year. Yeah. And great friends. Yes. This is so typical of Larry, right? - Sex, Lies, and-- - Revenge of the Nerds. And Videotape. Okay, no. Okay. Rat. Rat. Ratatouille. Shrek. Shrek! Shrek! We're so losing. Come on, give me some more. Okay, me, wife, woman. Woman. Uh-- Moby Dick? I know, I know. My Best Friend's Wedding! You're a genius. What? What were you thinking? We're so good. You guys are terrible. It's a New Year's Eve party. - What were they doing? There are a lot of cars out there. Well, when the cat's away... Yo, yo, hey, where are you going? Going to pick up some booze. Yeah. You're the man. I know, right? Get in here. Those jerks from the parking lot are here and now Ryan's trying to fight them. What, you think you can take me? Stop. Aren't you gonna do something about this? No, this is Ryan's deal. He told me to stay out of it. Ooh. Okay, okay, all right. Now you either get out of here or you deal with me. We're gonna go. Let's go. Yeah, get out of here. Come on, bro. Get up. Let's get up. Let's go upstairs. Come on. Go smoke some weed and chill out. It's all right. It's all right, come on. Did you see Eddie's face after the race? It was glowing. I thought your head was gonna pop off, buddy. Oh, no. Oh, Sara-bear. Come here, honey. What's wrong? It's so noisy outside. Oh, I know. Come here. Should we call the cops? No, maybe I'll just go over there and talk to Shane. Come on, pilgrims. Let's go over there and scare those kids straight. I love you, Daddy. Oh, my baby, come here. I love you. Go upstairs. Don't wake your brother up. Hurry back. I'll put her to bed. Good night, Sara. Let's split up, ask for Shane. You got it, cowboy. Have you seen Shane Batesman? Uh-uh. I-- I don't know. Hello, ladies. You know where Shane is? Yo, go long. He's a future Heisman winner, baby. Nice catch. I can't take you anywhere. I know, right? Here. You're unreal. Oh, man. How's that going? - Not bad. Oh, hey. Come here, come here. Heh-heh. Oh. You are so wasted. What? Lighten up. You're such a drunk. New Year's Eve celebration from Times Square... They are asleep. - Come on. Where's my drink? Hey. Hi, honey. Well, where's your posse? I don't know. I lost them. Lost them? Three Stooges. You left them there? Oh, that place is a mob scene. Can I come in? Just shut the door. - All right. - You're an all-star? - A real all-star. - You gotta hold it. Yeah, good one. Busted. Hey, what's going on in here? Who are you? Where's Shane? He's not here right now. This is my friend's house and you're gonna have to take it downstairs. This room is off-limits. It's almost midnight. Oh, guys, we gotta-- We need refills. I hate it when Ryan is drunk. Everybody, get downstairs! First kiss and hug of the New Year. I like the odds. Get ready, ladies. You're a devil. Jordan? I think I'm gonna throw up. I'm gonna take him home. I'm gonna call Bob. He's missing everything. Okay, honey, it's yours, it's you. It's you, baby, it's you. I'm sorry. - Sixteen, 15, Eight, seven, six-- - Five, four, three, two-- - One. Happy New Year! Happy New Year! B-- Bob? Cheers. Hey, hey. Hey. It's New Year. Aren't you gonna give me a kiss? I kissed him and he just pushed me away like I was gross. It's gonna be a wonderful year. Yeah. Happy New Year, sweetie. Get in the car. Why don't you give him another call on his cell? It's good. I need more. - This is good. I know. Hi. This is Bob McIntosh. Leave a message. Larry, what's going on? It's-- It's Bob. He's unconscious. What? What happened? What do we have? Adult male, full cardiac arrest. Start external compressions now. It's Bob McIntosh. Steve? Steve, is Bob gonna be okay? I'll take good care of him. Let me do my job. Mrs. McIntosh, I'm sorry, but you're not allowed in here. What the hell's going on? Nothing. Well, obviously something. What about you all? Can you tell me what happened here? Some guy got hurt. They took him away in an ambulance. Somebody got hurt? Who was it? How should I know? Did any of you see what happened? No. No, officer. I mean, I just got here, so... You're Shane Batesman, right? Yeah. I know your dad. You think he's gonna be happy with this? No, I think he's gonna be pretty pissed off. I'll drop your truck off tomorrow. You're mad at me. Yeah. Ryan. I love you like crazy. Heh. I love you too. Thanks. So you don't know who this guy was? Other than he was an ass, no. He said he was your dad's friend or something. Wait, so you talked to him? We only talked to him for, like, a second. Yeah. He told us to leave so we went out. It's not a big deal. But what happened to the guy then? Who called the ambulance? I don't know. I was down here partying when it all went down. My parents are gonna freak. The waiting is the hardest part. Remember when you were in that car accident? What? I never heard about that. It's back when we were dating. He broke his arm, a couple of his ribs, his nose. And look at him now. Steve. I tried to resuscitate him. No, don't-- I-- I did everything I could. But Bob died. Steve, no. Katy, I'm very sorry. Oh, my God. Okay. Katy, I'm so sorry. They think maybe it was a heart attack. They're not sure. They're gonna do an autopsy. The stock market closed with a solid... Hey, happy New Year, Jordy. Happy New Year, Daddy. How was the party? It was okay. Mm-hm. Just okay? We're gonna check out a matinee, if you'd like to come. Mm. Thanks, but I have to take Ryan's truck back. Okay. A Rees Harbor man has died after being rushed to Rockport General from a New Year's Eve party on King James Road. What's going on in here? Where's Shane? He's not here right now. --At the home of a neighbor where I have to find my phone. Attempts to revive were unsuccessful. Jordan? What's this big emergency, you had to get me up so early? You know that guy from the party last night? He died. What guy? What are you talking about? The guy who came into the bedroom and told us to get out. You really don't remember. No. I'm calling Angie. Angie, did you hear about the guy, the one from the party? I know, he died. I'll get Keith and Aaron to meet us. You call Ryan. I got Ryan already. He doesn't remember anything. He got way too drunk. Shh. Calm. Quiet. What are we gonna do? Don't say anything. Just get over to Rees Point and we'll figure it out when we get there. - Katy, can I get you some tea? - Sure, thanks. Hey, Sara-bear, come here. Come here. Hey. Hey. Where's your brother? Where's Daddy? I can't find him. I know, baby. Come here. I gotta talk to both of you. Come here. I have something sad to tell you about Daddy. Hey, this is Keith. Leave a message after the tone. Did you guys get Keith? No, he's not answering his phone. So this guy really died, huh? Man, that sucks. Yeah. Yeah, it sucks. This cop was asking us all these questions. What did you tell him? Nothing. I mean, there's nothing to tell, really. Right? How can you say that? What do you mean? You were there. It was no big thing. Come on, let's just go. The rest of you too. Let's go. Yeah, we heard you. We're on our way out, all right? We should say we never saw the guy. There were other people up there when he came in. We should tell the cops what we told Shane, that the guy came into the bedroom, he told us to get out and we left. And the last time we saw him, he was alive and well, which is true. Is it? Yes. You were there. I went out before you guys. You were in there when I left. Yeah, we were right behind you. Would you please tell her? Man, I don't remember any of this. I have a snowboard competition coming up. I want that endorsement deal. My dad got me that internship at the paper this summer. Yeah, so if we open our mouths, we're all screwed. She's not gonna say anything. She's cool. Right, Jordan? Fine. I won't say anything. Good. Now, what about that sophomore that was there? Aaron. Hey. I thought maybe you and I could go take a little ride. Mom, I'll be right back. Yeah? - It's Sandy. Come on in. A Detective Jackson is here to see you. Okay. I'll be right down. The full autopsy report won't be available until next week. I got a call from the coroner's office this morning with a preliminary report. Yeah, it was a heart attack. No. Your husband died of a brain hemorrhage. You mean like a--? Like a stroke? Not exactly, no. The problem was a lack of blood to the brain due to a severed artery. What are you saying? I'm saying that your husband suffered a blunt force trauma consistent with a beating. That's impossible. I'm sorry. Mrs. McIntosh, the coroner believes that your husband was kicked to death. He was murdered. These are from Bob's office. Mommy, where's my cereal? It's right here. I've got it. Okay. I don't want milk on my cereal. What? That's okay, I'll get you another bowl, honey. It's fine, it's fine. I'll run to the store. - It's fine. Sorry. I didn't know she liked them dry. It's okay, really. You know what, can you get the door? Yeah. Thank you. I'm just gonna pour the milk out. Here, just eat it like that. Those are all wet. Okay. I'll-- I'll fix it. Mommy, I'm hungry. Sara, I am doing the best I can, okay? I'm sorry. Here. Just start on those, okay? There. Can you start on those, babe? I'll make you some toast. Katy, you're exhausted. Why don't you go and lie down? I can watch the kids. I'm good. I need to keep moving. Otherwise I'll start crying and I might not be able to stop. They just lost their dad. I can't let them think they've lost their mom too. Paul, you wanted to see me? Yeah. Okay, so you were the first unit on scene last night, right? Yes, sir. Okay. You secured the area, identified all witnesses. Paramedics told me they thought it was a heart attack. There were 200 kids here last night. You must have got a lot of information. If I had any indication this was a crime scene, I would've been more thorough. I've got maybe a dozen names. Okay, well, we have to contact each and every one of those kids that were here at the party, so I hope you're up for some serious overtime. Yeah? Finally someone picks up their phone. What the hell happened last night? What are you talking about? There's cops all over my house. My dad's friend from across the street was killed here. What? Wasn't just dead, he was murdered. In my parents' bedroom. Murdered? You're kidding. What? What's wrong? My parents are gonna be home in an hour. What the hell am I supposed to tell them? What? Uh-- I'll call you back. Look, this doesn't change anything. No reason we should spill our guts about what happened. Don't see how an investigation changes anything? Would you keep your voice down? Not for us. Okay, we didn't kill the guy. How do you know? He was on the floor when Keith and I left that room. Yes, yes, he was on the floor, but he was still bitching at us. Dude, that was harsh, man. Ha-ha-ha. What the hell's wrong with you people? - Let's go party. - That was sick. Would you please tell them, Daisy? Yeah. There was a lot of other people upstairs when we went out. Exactly. So if the guy got whacked, then someone else did the whacking. And I don't want that pinned on us, do you? Where's Keith? I don't know. His dad took his phone away. Hi, Jordan. Hi. These are the memorial ribbons for Bob McIntosh. - Okay. - They expect so many people, they'll hold it at the community center. Anyway, hand them out. That'd be great. Yeah. Bob McIntosh was many things: Father, husband, friend. But he was also a lawyer, committed to justice. A commitment for Bob meant action. And his death was tragic, untimely, and so unnecessary. Okay. It's okay. - Let's go. Get up. - All right, I'm fine, you guys. - You too, buddy. Let's go. - We heard you, okay? Something happened at the funeral yesterday. I... I think I remember. What do you remember? Mostly acting like a jerk. I acted like a jerk that whole night, didn't I? Yeah, pretty much. I don't know why you haven't dumped me already. I don't know either. When you're not with your friends, you are the sweetest person I've ever met. Why are you ragging on them? They've been good to you. When you hang out with them, you get stupid. You get into fights, and now this guy got killed. You're saying my friends killed him? No, that's not what I'm saying. You know what? Forget it. Jordan, I don't wanna fight. Me either. I can just keep driving, you know? You can come stay at my place for a little. No, they'll just be back. I might as well get this over with. So we were just hanging out in the room. And then the guy, Mr. McIntosh, he came in, and said that he wanted us to get out. Can you remember his exact words? I don't know, like: "I'm gonna have to ask you to take the party downstairs," or something. And what did you do? I got up and said, "Let's go," and... Was this the point when Keith Moore called him a name? I guess. Come on. Oh! Ha-ha. That was sick. Oh, you little bitch. Maybe Keith did call him a name. Okay. But then he came out with me and Angie and... Oh, yeah. Come on, let's go party. Yee! Then the other guys, they came out right after us. And the last time you saw Bob McIntosh, he was... What, he was just standing there? Yeah. He didn't seem like he was distressed in any way to you? Is that true? If she says it's true, it's true. If she saw anything that might help, she knows we'd expect her to come forward. Daisy isn't home right now. Don't know when she'll be back. Okay, what? What? Keith called him a name? Okay, I don't remember that, but, I mean, I was pretty wasted. Look, we know they're underage. And we've had a long, very serious talk about all that, right? Yeah. It's not gonna happen again. Uh-huh. What happened after Keith got into this sparring match with Mr. McIntosh? Nothing. Nothing? How many people would you say were upstairs when you left? Let me guess. Ten. Ten. Ten. The kids are having so much fun. I'm so glad you didn't cancel. Well, I can't cancel birthdays. No. Bob was so excited to throw this party for the kids. You know, he loved parties. Yes, he did. Red light! You want me to help? This pinhata was his idea, and now I don't know how to hang it up. You know, I called that grief counselor, and he said to me, that it would be three weeks before I could get an appointment. He said, "I don't know if you're aware, but there's been a crisis in this town." Katy, it's okay to grieve. Katy, there's someone at the door. You know, I'll go get that. No, I got it, I got it. Here, you have a look at it. Is this a bad time? Um... Dealing with teenagers is tough with peer pressure not to talk to cops. But we have narrowed this down to a small group of kids that had some confrontation with your husband that led to an attack. Unfortunately, they're all saying the same thing. It was just a short exchange and Bob was alive when they left the room. And do you believe them? They're not telling the whole story. What's that mean? Several said there were others upstairs. We're trying to figure out who those others were. Two hundred kids at that party, no one saw what happened to Bob? No, we will continue to interview them, and eventually-- Eventually? How am I supposed to live with eventually? How am I supposed to take my kids to the market, and not know if the boy bagging killed their father? Mrs. McIntosh, I completely under-- No, I'm sorry, but you don't. Every time I walk out my front door, and I see that house and I think: "That's where Bob was beaten to death and, gee, I wonder who did it." I'm sorry. I know that you're working overtime. Oh, no. You have every right to be frustrated. It's not just that. It's... I hate feeling powerless. And some of those kids must know what happened to Bob. There's gotta be a way that I can convince them to talk. And there is, but that's not your job. That's my job. Okay? Okay. She has been posting dozens of flyers throughout Rees Harbor asking for help in the killing that remains unsolved. Dad, are we still going out to--? Shh. She hopes the $10,000 reward will encourage those with information about her husband's death to come forward. I don't know how anyone who lives here can feel safe when we have a bunch of drunk, violent, irresponsible kids, who are posing a threat to the community. The kids who know what happened to Bob, need to tell the police what they know. Their parents should be encouraging them to do this. Hey, Shane. What's his problem lately? My dad put me through this third-degree thing last night. It sucked. It totally sucked. Have you guys seen this? We know all about it. Not our problem. We're done. Aren't you worried someone's gonna tell? No. Because everybody knows that a rat is the scum of the earth. Right. So don't even think about trying to score some cash. First of all, I think staying out of jail is worth a hell of a lot more than a lousy 10 grand, and second, I'm no rat. Then we have nothing to worry about, do we? Oh, right. We only lied to the cops in a murder investigation. This is our senior year. Wasn't this supposed to be the most fun time of our whole lives? Not so much. You're not gonna talk to my daughter. You've talked to her twice. I resent it. Legally speaking, she's 18. I don't need permission. Yeah, legally speaking, I can sue your ass for harassment. Look, Angie needs to focus on finishing school, getting ready for college. She can't do that with you twisting her arm to get her to admit to something she didn't do. Twisting her arm? I'm not. I'm warning you, stay away from these kids. And I am telling you, these kids need to come clean about what happened. Right, right. Well, that's great. Okay, well, thank you very much for calling. I appreciate it, and we'll get back to you if we need to. Thanks. This is crazy. I wish she'd talked to me first. I can only follow up on four or five an hour. Should put another guy on this. Concentrate on the witnesses we know were there, forget all these long shots. You telling the switchboard to forward these calls to me? Detective Jackson. I can barely hear you. You were at the party? Wow. Wow. Look at that car. Nice. How do you like my new birthday present, huh? My sisters were so freaking jealous, man, they were, like, crying. So are you and Daisy, like, together now? We might be. She's all right. Keith. Where you been? Grounded. Is that your ride? It is so sick, eh? It's hot. So sick. Look at that thing. Come on, let's-- Whoa, what's going on? Keith Moore, we have a warrant for your arrest. Wait. Why? You're charged with manslaughter What? In the death of Robert McIntosh. I already told you, it was a tap. I told you that. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney... You ratted him out, didn't you? No. This is so wrong. Hey, how are you? Good morning. Hi, guys. Oh, you're welcome. Did you see all the letters to the editor defending Keith Moore as if he's the victim in all this? I know. My neighbor was saying she's known Keith since he was 10, and she said he's a real good kid. Yeah, well, maybe he is a really good kid, but he still hit Bob at least once. Thanks for looking after the kids. It's important that I'm there at the arraignment today. He admitted from the beginning that he punched Bob in the face? And you never told me? He called it a tap. We had no confirmation from witnesses that it was anything but that until an anonymous call said a punch put him on the ground. What else did they say? A punch doesn't explain a severed artery. He must have kicked him. Well, that's all they're saying. I thought you said you brought in the person who's responsible. No, I never said that. But you're charging him with manslaughter. Keith Moore is gonna break the silence between these kids. We're hoping he gives us the killer if he thinks he's facing jail time. Now, you brace yourself. Moore's got a lot of support. Here he comes! We're with you. You hang in there, bro. Don't worry. The town is behind you. - We're with you. Do you have a comment? Look this way, Mrs. McIntosh, please. You shouldn't be going after my son. He's cooperated with the police from the beginning. He didn't have anything to do with it! Don't you care? You could ruin his life. You leave our kids alone. This isn't right. I'm not backing down till I find out who did it. I have the right to know. Hey, sweetie. Sorry I'm so late. I picked up sandwiches at the deli, if you're hungry. Uh-- No. I'm not feeling too good. Oh, no. Are you feeling sick again? Are you running a fever? No, it's just my stomach. Last week, it was your head, and now your stomach. Jordan. That's weird. Doesn't she usually call your cell? Can you just tell her I'm asleep or something? Hi, Jordan. No, I'm sorry. He can't come to the phone. He's not feeling very well. You seen Ryan? He hasn't been here in a week. He's not answering his phone. Do I look like his secretary to you? Hey, guys, check this out. That's what you get, snitch. I never said anything to anyone. Yeah, right. I hate you. What is wrong with you? Why do that? The judge wouldn't let Keith out of jail unless he promised not to talk to us. Do you know how hard I've been working to keep her quiet? You just messed that all up. Newsflash, she didn't stay quiet. Daisy, I'm sorry. You guys have no reason to be mean. If I had called the cops, they would know a lot more. Just shut up, Daisy. A lot of other stuff happened that you guys don't even know-- Just shut your mouth! You wanna mess with us? Stay down, punk. Just don't say anything to Angie, all right? Just don't say anything to anybody. I think there's more on me than Sara. You're a mess. You really should've let me buy. Aw. Thank you. But, uh, we're fine for the moment. Hey, look, there's Sally. Hey, Sally. What is that all about? I got a nasty e-mail from her the other day. Her daughter was at the party. She asked whether I was gonna have her arrested too. Oh, of all the stupid things to say. Well, if nothing else, I'm finding out who my real friends are. Yeah. Ryan? What? Jordan's here to see you. Don't let her in. It's a little late for that. Come on in, honey. Oh, my God. I had to come. You don't answer your phone. Are you mad at me? No. Then why won't you talk to me? The detective was at school today, and things are getting really crazy between Angie and Daisy. Angie thinks Daisy is some kind of a snitch. Daisy says-- I don't wanna know what Daisy says. She says a lot more happened that Angie and I don't know about. This is why I don't wanna talk! All you talk about is that night. I don't wanna talk about it. I don't wanna think about it! Will you please get out and leave me alone? Please! Just get-- Just get out. Get out. What are you even doing here, huh? Damn it! Katy, you got a minute? Yeah, I gotta pick up the twins. What is it? DA is dropping the manslaughter charge against Keith Moore. What? Why? We got Bob on the ground, but no one's telling us what happened after. So the whole thing was just a bluff? And Keith's attorney called us on it. I'm sorry. So basically, after three months, you have nothing. These kids are in this group mentality, not talking. The parents aren't helping. Not that I blame them. You don't blame them? Think about it. What would you do? If Josh and Sara were at that party, would you turn them in? I don't know. I'd like to think that I would do the right thing. I need you to know that I'm not giving up on this case. I'm not gonna stop until I find the person who did this. You know I can't just sit around and do nothing, right? You know that. You're sure about this? Uh-- Why don't you read me what you have? I typed it up. "The months since my husband's murder have been the most pa--" I hate this. I'm-- I'm not good at public speaking. Yes, you are. You can do this. You're doing it for Josh and Sara. Right. Okay. Again. Okay. "The months since my husband's murder have been the most painful and difficult months of my life and the lives of our two children." Not only did we lose Bob, but knowing that he was a victim of a violent crime has threatened our sense of safety in our community. Today, my attorney will be filing a civil suit against the known witnesses who last saw my husband alive. There is something very wrong in Rees Harbor if our children can witness a fatal beating and not come clean. We all need to address that. The news of the wrongful death suit brought by the victim's widow, Katy McIntosh, against several high school students, exploded through the town of Rees Harbor today. We found sentiment both for and against the action, revealing a town that has become bitterly divided since the murder in question. I didn't know Bob McIntosh, but I don't blame his wife at all. I don't think it's right what's going on. People aren't coming out because they think it's not safe. It's hurting my business. People are like, "Those kids should talk." That's not right. I'd never rat out my friends, no matter what. She deserves to know who killed her husband. You give me 10 minutes alone with those kids, I'll find out who did it. We also spoke with Detective Paul Jackson, who is in charge of the case. I'm not gonna comment on this lawsuit, but we are aware that information is being withheld. And if anybody wants to come in and clarify their previous statements, they can do so without fear of repercussions. I don't know what to do. I don't have money to hire a lawyer. We can hire one to represent all of us. Doesn't change the fact that I can't afford it. Don't worry about that, Leo. We'll make sure it's covered. I wanna know if we can countersue for slander or defamation or-- That's what I'm thinking. We shouldn't take this public harassment lying down. It's a terrible tragedy that her husband was killed, but that doesn't give her the right to make scapegoats of our children. Hey, is Ryan here? No. Hasn't been home for a couple nights. I'll call the police. Come in. We'll ask the kids. They're in the back. Hi. Hi. Hey, have any of you kids seen Ryan? No. - Me neither. I have an idea where he might be. I can check. Really? - Yeah. Okay. I appreciate it. I'm coming with you. No, no, I got this. He's my boyfriend. I'm going with you. All right. Jordan, you call me. I will. Who lives here? I told you, no questions, unless you wanna wait in the car. What do you dumb-asses want? Chuck, we're looking for Ryan. His truck's here. Is he in there with you? Don't know. Ryan, you in here? What are you doing here? Wanna come out here and talk to us? Why did you bring her? Ryan, don't. What? You're the one that doesn't like me when I'm drunk. Well, I'm drunk now, baby. Heh-heh. I'm hammered. Great. We're very happy for you. But your mom is freaking out. You haven't been home. No. What? What? What do you mean? I left a note. Unless, uh-- Unless I forgot. Ha. Oops. Ha-ha. We're gonna take you home, tell your mom to chill out, then we'll come back here and party. No, man, I'm not going home. I'm gonna crash here with Chuck for a while, so... What about school? We have a couple of months until graduation. You're not listening to me. I don't give a crap about school. I, uh... I'm done with school, I'm done with home, and I'm done with you, so... But what about our plans? We were gonna get an apartment, we were gonna go to college. I don't wanna talk anymore. Dude, are you coming? All right, forget this. I'm out of here. Let's go. I wish that you would just tell me what's wrong. Hey, Katy. Um... Excuse me. Uh... You're Jordan, right? Yeah. You were in the room when my husband was killed, weren't you? I just-- - Excuse me. I'm gonna need you to take your break now, okay? I'll serve Mrs. McIntosh. Okay. I'll be right with you. Yeah. You see that girl I was talking to? Yeah. One of the witnesses. You're kidding me. Katy, leave the poor girl alone. Sandra. No, Katy, I'm sorry, it's just-- It's a tourist town, okay? This is making it difficult for people to make a living. I can't pretend nothing happened. No one's saying that. There are better ways to go about it. Can't you let the police do their job? They're not doing their job. Then just leave those kids alone. Sandra, one of those kids kicked Bob so hard that it killed him. I know. It's just that-- I want them to find the guilty person. Do you? Yes. But it's just-- If this is your strategy, it's not working. Yeah, well, no one gave me a rule book. I gotta go. Katy, don't-- I can't believe you just said that. Jordan, if you know what happened to my husband, and you're keeping quiet to protect your friends-- Mrs. McIntosh. Yeah, I'm leaving. Please. I'm leaving, I'm leaving. Mrs. McIntosh, wait. I didn't keep quiet. I was the one who called the police. I left the room after I saw Keith punch your husband. I don't know anything else. If I did, I would tell you. And the others, do they know what happened? I think so, some of them, but they will never talk about it around me. Jordan, thank you. Thank you. You were the snitch. Hi, Katy. What can I do for you? Jordan Mathers believes that some of the kids do know what happened. Okay, that's helpful. Of course, we've known that all along. No one's ever said those words. Now you can bring them in and interrogate them. Again. Yeah, you know, I can interrogate them 16 more times. When you put this much pressure on a group of kids, they band together and protect each other. Are you talking about my lawsuit? You're allowed to sue. But it's hard to exploit cracks in a group when they're bonding together, hiring attorneys to tell them to shut their mouth. I thought I was helping. To help, trust us to do our jobs. Trust isn't my strongest suit right now. There's stuff going on I just can't discuss. I know. I get it, Paul. I am on your side. I am not your enemy, Katy. Yeah, well, sometimes it doesn't feel like that. I'm-- I'm, uh-- I'm sorry. I don't know if I can keep doing this. Maybe I should just move back to Portland, be close to my family. I got uppers, downers. Got weed, really good stuff. Like really primo stuff. - We're talking at least three. - Three? - At least. Looks like I got a couple new customers. Go get us some beers. All right. All right. Yeah, so, I mean, this stuff is... You sure you don't want me to go in with you? We can talk to the principal and tell him what's going on. No, then they'll just think I ratted them out twice. I know you feel bad, but you did the right thing. When did I ever do the right thing? I lied to the police in the beginning, I lied to you, I lied to my friends. If you have to make yourself an accomplice to murder to prove your loyalty to friends, it's time to get new friends. You think? Bye. Bye. Hey. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I know. I thought Pat was gonna smack me after you left. No, no-- She should've. You helped me see things differently. I'm dropping the lawsuit. You're what? Yeah, I thought that it would help convince the kids to talk, but I was wrong. I've been wrong about a lot of things lately. No, I never should have said what I said. I was way out of line. No, Sandy, I just... I want you to understand that this isn't about vengeance. Wanna get some tea? Yes. I don't blame you guys for being mad. Oh, we are way beyond mad. I know. You're scared too. You should be scared. I am. I've been freaked out since New Year's Eve. So you had Keith arrested? I just wanted to tell what I saw. We don't want the cops to know what you saw. Why not? No one was trying to kill anyone that night. I'm not gonna rot in prison and be somebody's bitch. Do you understand that? Why would you be going to prison? Unless you were the one who kicked Bob McIntosh in the head. Where'd you hear that? Huh? Did Ryan tell you that? No. Is that why he's losing it right now? Because he knows that you did it and he's afraid to tell anyone? Look at him. Guy thinks he's in "Call of Duty." Whoa. Whoa. Hey, man. Hey, Ryan, come on, chill out. Come smoke some of this joint, soak in the beauty of nature. He's a tortured soul. Yeah? And why is that? Sorry. It's just a BB gun. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't even know it was you. I'm sorry. Shh. No, it's okay, it's okay. I shouldn't have done that. We broke up. Why? Why can't we be together? Why can't we go back to the way things were? I miss you so much. We just can't. It's like you dropped out of your whole life. It's like you're another person. Guess I am. Ryan, please. Just drop it, Jordan. What did Aaron do? I know you remember. Is she tripping or what? You were there? Yeah. So you know how that guy died? Yeah. Give me a kiss night-night. I love you. I love you. Night-night. Sweet dreams. Mommy? Yeah, honey? Jeremy said that I should hurt those guys that killed Daddy. Oh, no, baby. That's the last thing that we want. We don't want any more people hurt. Do I have to stop thinking about Daddy? No. We are never gonna forget about Daddy. Forgiving doesn't mean forgetting. Your daddy is always gonna be right here, right in our hearts. Okay? All right, you have Lion? Mm-hm. Okay, give me a kiss. Hello. Katy. Paul Jackson. I wanted you to know we brought Ryan Aldridge in tonight. You did? Our undercover guys got him on tape saying he knows who killed your husband. Finally. You've gotta be kidding me. Couldn't get Ryan to talk. He's reluctant to say anything that might put a friend in prison. You're not thinking of letting him go. What choices do I have? I could book him on obstruction, but he'll just get an attorney to cry entrapment and get him off. Look, Katy, um... You think you're gonna find closure in the justice system, and you won't. Then let me talk to him. No. No. Why? That's not the way things are done. No, you could jeopardize the case. Ruin the case? What case? You have nothing. You just said that he will probably walk. Why do you think you can get more out of him than we have? Because I'm a mother, and I know how to talk to kids. He's probably scared. I know I have been since New Year's Eve. Paul, please. I should have every right to look him in the eye, and ask him what happened if he knows anything. I don't know. Paul, this is your chance to close the case. You're a piece of work, you know that? All right. I'll tell the DA you'll sue us if we don't give you a shot. Thank you. You ready? I have no idea what I'm gonna say to him. Katy McIntosh at a loss for words? Now, remember, the DA has put a 30-minute time limit on this. Okay. Not much of a conversation and this kid has perfected the art of playing deaf. So I got a guy right outside the room. I'll be on the other side of the wall. Come on. You sure you wanna do this alone? You don't have to. Yes, I do. In my mind, you looked so different. I have a son, and a daughter too. They're twins. Two for one. Heh. I've got some pictures, if you wanna see. There, um... That's Bob with the kids. And, um... I think they were around 4 when that picture was taken. That's Josh and there's Sara. I call her Sara-bear. Sara's more like me. She... She won't let anyone see her cry, but I-- I keep finding a picture of Bob hidden under her pillow. And Josh, he's different. He cries and he asks all kinds of questions, like, who's gonna take off his training wheels? And I hate those kinds of things, I guess because I'm not that good at them. I'm trying to keep their lives normal. They keep asking me what happened to their father, and I don't know what to tell them, because I don't know, but you do. Ryan, look at me. You know what happened to Bob that night, don't you? I know that you're not at peace. They told me that you dropped out of school and... You must be carrying a terrible burden and I know you're scared. Ryan. Ryan, look at me. You have to talk about it. You have to talk about what happened that night. You have to tell the truth. We are in this together. Right? Whether we like it or not, we are in this together. You need to tell the police what happened. And I promise you, Ryan, I promise you, I will stand by you. I will be there for you 110 percent, I promise. He's just a boy. I'll tell you what happened, but I want my mom here first. Katy. It'll be okay. Whatever you have to say, I'm here for you. Okay. All right. For the record, I'm talking with Ryan Aldridge with his attorney present. Okay, Ryan. Why don't you tell us what you know about New Year's Eve? Well, uh, first of all, I was kind of out of it, so there are some parts I don't remember. But there were way more people than we expected, and there was a ton of alcohol. I probably should have eaten first, but... I got really drunk, really fast. Um... These guys showed up who had given my girlfriend a hard time earlier. Get out! Think you can take me? You know, I was angry. I just wanted to get back at them. Before I got a chance to, the one hit me, and knocked me down in front of all my friends. Um, it was, um, humiliating. Um... I guess we must have gone upstairs. He's a future Heisman winner, baby. I was still really pissed. Oh. You are so wasted. What? Lighten up. But I was trying to chill out, and then Mr. McIntosh comes in. Busted. Ha-ha-ha. Hey, you guys, what's going on in here? What? Who are you? Where's Shane? He's not here right now. Uh, this is my friend's house. You have to take it downstairs. This room is off-limits. Ha-ha. Yeah. Yeah, if you insist, buddy. I think you're the one who's off-limits, bro. Narc. Outnumbered. We can play this one of two ways. - Guys, let's go. Come on. Ryan? Please? Let's go. Come on. The rest of you too. Come on, let's go. Get up, please. All right, let's go. He says we have to take the party downstairs. Thank you. Come on. We heard you. We're on our way out. I don't really know what happened, but Keith punched him. Oh! Whoa! Come on. Let's go party. Ha-ha. Bitch. And Mr. McIntosh, you know, he was on his hands and knees. And it was like, "Okay. We've got this guy who's giving us crap. We got him down." That was harsh, man. Are you gonna mess with us, huh? So Aaron pushes him back down. Stay down, punk. Ha. I was just so sick of people giving me crap, you know? Then, uh... Then I kicked him. I kicked him. I-- I-- I don't know why, but I kicked him, like, maybe three or maybe four times. You know, I didn't-- I didn't realize how hard I kicked him. I killed him. It was me. I killed him. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's gonna be okay. Beth: Ryan's been arrested. He confessed. Yeah, that's really cool. Hello? Wait. What? Ryan just got arrested. Keith Moore pled guilty to assault, and was given a three year conditional discharge. Ryan Aldridge pled guilty to manslaughter in the dead of Robert McIntosh, received a five year prison sentence.
