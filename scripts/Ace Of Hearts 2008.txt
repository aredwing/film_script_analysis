Let's go, buddy. - All right. I'll take this side. You work that side. - Okay. Okay, buddy, here we go. What do you got, buddy? What do you got? Let's go, Sasha. Come on. Find him, Sasha. Find him. Search, buddy. Search. Search. - [Barking] - Good boy. Good boy. Seek, buddy. Seek. Seek, buddy. Come on. Seek. That dog of yours a K-9 or a pinwheel, Dan? It might look funny to you, but as soon as he locks on... [Barking] Go get him! Go get him! Whoa! Help me! Help me, please! - Ohh! Let go! - Good boy! Let go! Help! Help me! Get him off of me! Help me! Ow! Yeah. Pinwheel, huh? [Man Shouting, Yelping] Come here, boy. Come on. Ohh! Help me! Get him off of me! Ohh! Ohh! - [Shouting, Sputtering Continue] - Good boy. That's a good boy. Come on. Come on. [TV Announcer] Welcome back to Good Day Everett with Jimmy Bixler. - [Dan] Are you ready, Jimmy? - Bring it on.! - Go get him! - Whoa! Oh! - [Dan] Good boy. - There he is. Okay. Off. Off. - [Growling] - Okay. - You can get up now. - Wow. If pooch had his way with me... I would've ended up at Miller Memorial in Room 402 and 403. Actually, Ace would never have crossed that line. In fact, no police dog ever would. - That's good to know. - Give him a treat. Okay. There you go, Ace. - There you go. That's better than my arm. - [Studio Audience Laughs] We like to say that we train 'em just to restrain 'em. [Jimmy] Well, that's good to know. Now, I understand that Ace's sense of smell... - is 40,000 times sharper than ours. - That's correct. One whiff of your hand, and he could track you down in your seat anywhere in Safeco Field. - Really. I can't even find my car after a game. - [Audience Laughs] Now, uh, before the show, you did mention... that you're having trouble tracking down at least one criminal... who strikes while people are on vacation... a robber with a colorful nickname. Yeah, that's correct, Jimmy. Right now, we have a prowler working in our county... that so far has eluded all of our track downs. We've kind of dubbed him "Goliath" because... Well, he's built, um... - Just like me. - [Laughter] Just kidding, Ace. No, no. I'm more like David. Goliath is the big one. All right. Well, we'll be back in a second. When we do, we'll have an interview with Ace. We'll ask him how he got promoted from K-7 to K-8 and finally to K-9. [Jimmy] Ace, good boy. [Audience Applause Fades Out] Wow. Looks fabuloso. Thank Mrs. Brody. - Who? - My home-ec teacher. - Oh, right. - You're supposed to grade me. Like, did I burn it or anything dumb? Mmm. Hmm. I'm giving you... a D-plus. - Wha... - For "Delicious-plus." [Chuckles] Hilarious. Is Dad around? It's okay. I mean, only one parent has to sign the grade sheet, so... Other side. Other side. - Dad. - I'll be right in, honey. [Sighs] Don't bother. Dinner's over and stuff. Hey. Hey. That's a distraction, okay? It's roasted chicken with garlic and black fig reduction a la Julia actually. - What? - Nothing. - [Murmurs] - [Sighs] - Dad. - Mm-hmm? Can I handle Ace at the K-9 competition this year? Oh, that's not a very good idea, honey. - I even read those boring training manuals. - You're 13 years old, okay? Fourteen in 29 days. Please, Dad. Honey, Ace needs to feel really comfortable when he's in a competition. - Why can't you just trust me for once? - It's not a matter of trust. It is! You don't trust me with your stupid dog. - Julia... - Forget I even asked. Honey. Honey. Stay. Honey, I'll think about it, okay? Translation: "No." That went great. Teenage daughters. Teenage daughters. That's what it's all about. Yes, I know. It would've meant so much if you'd just spent a few minutes with us. The poor kid spent two hours fussing with that recipe. [Snoring] [Sighs] Uh... Off. Off. Dan. - Hmm? - Come on. Come on. Ace. Ace, come on. Down. Go to your bed. Go on. I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry. Good night. Good night. [Clicks Tongue] Ace, down to your bed. Down to your bed. [Snoring] [Sighs, Exhales] [Mom] I'm not a hundred percent sure I would've gone with "bile green." On my honeymoon, I'm having my nails done every day... and my toes. Really. Well, you might want to consider squeezing in a few other activities. Where'd you go, Mom? On your honeymoon. - Nowhere actually. - Nowhere? Turned out the K-9 unit needed your dad... so we postponed our trip to Tahiti. And then I guess we just never got around to rescheduling it. But you have to have a honeymoon, right? I mean, to be officially married and everything. No. [Inhales] [Grunts] [Inhales, Grunts] Hey, Torko. Didn't I tell you not to come back here... until your membership dues were up to date? - [Grunting] - Well, free ride's over. Let's go. [Grunts] You have three minutes to clear out. I assume you can count to three. [Grunts] [Barbell Clangs] I assume you can count to 50. - What? - [Grunts] [Groans] - Oops. My bad. - [Groaning] [Groans] [Alarm Blaring] [Alarm Continues, Muffled] [Phone Ringing] [Phone Beeps] This is Dan. Okay. We're on our way. - You ready, Ace? Let's go, buddy. - [Barking] [Police Radio Chatter] [Dan] Come on, boy. Seek. - Come on. Come on, boy. - Hey, Dan. Hey. Hey, what do you got? Maybe we'll get something this time, Frank. Huh? You got it, boy? Come on. Here we go. Let's get him. Search. Search. Here you go, buddy. You got him? There you go, buddy. There you go. There you go, buddy. There you go. You got it? You got it, buddy? Let's go. Anything? What is it? What do you got? Come on, buddy. Come on. It's gonna be a tough one to crack. This one leaves us plenty of nothin', He leaves behind something nasty for the dogs though. Let me see, buddy. Let me see. [Alarm Beeping] - [Stops] - Ready, boy? Let's go. Ace. Hup.! Through, through.! Through, through.! Over, over, over.! Up, up! Good boy. Again! Ace. You got him? Go, go! - [Growling] - Good boy.! Shake it up.! Shake it up.! Shake it up.! Good boy.! Good boy.! Off! Good boy. Good boy. Good boy. Go get it. Search. Go get it. Go get it. Search. Search. [Clapping] Good boy.! Good boy.! Yeah. That's my boy. Yes. [Chattering] Give it to me. Give it to me. That's my boy. Yes. You're such a good boy. You are. Yes, you're a good boy. Out. Yeah. That's my favorite boy. Good boy. [Sighs] I've studied so much, I can't even remember... if a polynomial's a number or an island in the Pacific. - Who wants to play Fantasy Fever? - [Boy] That reminds me. You still have my Inspector Dreadnought's Clue Pursuit. - Which one? - Number four. Unfinished Business. You've had it for, like, a million weeks. - It's around here somewhere. - Can you give it back to me soon? - [Ace Vocalizing] - Ace. - Ace, my man. - Hey. Does he know any tricks? My dad says I'm not supposed to teach him any tricks... because he's, like, his partner and shield and everything. But watch this. Hey, you. Hi there. Hi there. Hello. Good. Yes. It's our little secret. Right, Ace? He's... pretty big. How much does he weigh? Exactly 122 pounds. 'Cause my dad, like, measures out every single thing he feeds him. - Is that where he got shot? - Yep. Right through the ear. On the second day my dad and Ace started working together... this car-thief guy tried to shoot my dad. Ace saw it and jumped up and pushed my dad out of the way just in time. Ace got a medal at this banquet. Yeah. Val, relax. I know he's a police dog and everything, but he's as playful as a puppy. Here. Want this? Go get it. No! [Screams] [Whimpering] Hey.! What happened? Is everybody okay? Huh? Back up. Back up off the glass. Back off the glass. Hey. Hey, easy. - Mind telling me what you were doing? - I just wanted to show Val... Do you understand what would have happened if he'd gotten glass in his paws? Dad. I know. - Do you know how that would have affected everything? - Dad... My safety, my life depends on him being in perfect shape during a track down. - Dad, I feel terrible. - He is not a house pet. - I know, Dad. - He is my partner, my shield. - Do you understand that? - I know. I'm sorry. Please, do you forgive me? Do you? I said I'm sorry, Dad. - Do you forgive me? - Julia, you and your friends need to go outside right now. - [Sobs] - Julia! Hey, honey. You didn't come down, so I brought dinner to you. - Dad. - Mm-hmm? Could you, like, not be in here right now? Sure. [Door Opens] Does this thing have to be here, right in the hallway? Sorry, honey. I'll move it first thing tomorrow. Okay? How was your day? It was all right. - I made pasta. It's in the fridge. - Thank you. We have to talk. - About? - You know about what. Did she tell you how it happened, what she was trying to do with Ace? - Dan, she's hurting. - She was showing off in front of her friends. They knocked over the cabinet. There was glass all over the floor. - It could have gotten in Ace's paws. - She made a mistake. She apologized, but you didn't forgive her. That's not how we do things in this family. Okay, but she needs to understand that that dog is not just her house pet. - He's my partner, my shield... - "He's my shield." Yes, we all know that speech by heart. What does that make Julia? She needs your trust and your time. You don't spend enough time with her. So you're talking now as my wife or as my therapist? As Julia's mom. Do you know what she asked me this morning while I was braiding her hair? "Why can't he just love me Hey.! Hey.! Hey.! What are you doing? [Phone Beeping] Hello? 911? You want some breakfast, buddy? How about a little somethin' for you? - That's right, boy. - [Radio: Dispatcher] Attention, Sector 8 units. Got a 506 at 44 Frontera. - Respond, please. - This is Harding. Roger that. Is it Goliath? - [Barking] - Affirmative. All right. We're on it. Let's get him, buddy. Let's get him. - [Siren Wailing] - [Tires Screeching] [Panting] Let's go, Sasha. I'll head east. - Attention all units. Suspect is in the area. - All right. Good luck. Let's go. Let's go. Let's get him. There you go. You got him, buddy. Stay with him. What do you see? There, huh? [Barking] Ace, you got him? You got him, boy? Whoa. Whoa. Come here. - [Barking] - Whoa. Got him, boy? You got him? Go get him! Go get him! [Grunts] [Barking] - [Growling] - [Grunting] [Laughing] [Barking Continues] [Growls] [Grunts, Groaning] Uh! Uh! Get back! Help me.! He bit my neck.! He attacked me.! [Screaming] Someone... Oh, man! Ohh.! He bit my neck.! This is Harding, K-9 Unit 1. - I have the subject sighted. - He's tryin' to kill me! - [Growling Continues] - Call him off! - Help me! Help me! [Screams] - Come here! Come here! Off! Off! Come here.! Come on.! Come here.! Down! Down. Down. [Groaning] You blew it, buddy. You blew it bad. Hey. I need an ambulance here immediately. [Groaning, Gasping] [Woman] We're on the way. - [Man] They're still sweeping it down, sir. - [Police Radio Chatter] We're gonna do it. Ready? Let's lift him up. [Man] I don't know. There's something wrong with this whole scenario. This dog's got an exemplary track record. Dan Harding's one of our finest officers... and this guy Torko's got a rap sheet... longer than a kid's Christmas wish list. So we need to do a little damage control. Let's have a press conference immediately. If there's anything else, just refer it back to my office. [Chuckles] You can't hold the guy without something linking him to the scene. This has got to be Goliath. I've got a newspaper delivery guy who saw him. You got a delivery guy whose driver's license... says he's required to wear glasses, which he wasn't. His eyewitness testimony is worthless. [Exclaims, Sighs] Look, Torko's lawyer is shrewdly playing this... as an attack on an unarmed citizen out for his morning hike. He's threatening a monster lawsuit unless the charges are dropped... which is what my boss is recommending. I'm sorry, Joe. That makes two of us. Look, he's a repeater. You'll get him on the next one. Of course, the dog will have to be put down. - Put down? - Euthanized. I'm afraid it's the law. Once they go bad, they're an obvious danger to the public. Four-legged liability. [Sighs] Dan. There is no way Ace would have just attacked him. Ace is an animal. Animals get mad. Animals bite. - No. Not Ace. - It's out of my hands. Come on, Captain. You cannot let 'em do this. The best I can do is arrange for you to be there with him when... you know, when it happens. - They're taking him up to Spokane, and that's that. - Spokane? It seems this thing has to be done strictly according to procedures. The K-9 clinic and training facility are in Spokane... so that's where they have to take him. I've, uh, asked them to send you his ashes. - So at least you'll have a... - A souvenir? [Door Opens, Closes] [Exhales] Sorry, man. [Dog Barking In Distance] - [Whimpering] - Shh. Shh. Good-bye. I'm sorry, good buddy. [Whimpering] Come on. Here we go. - [Whimpering] - It's okay. Hush, hush. Hush, hush. Shh. All right. Quiet. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Captain, I'd like to drive... myself, I mean, to Spokane. Wouldn't it be easier to say good-bye here? Not for Ace. All right. Hey, Dan. I, uh... Just, uh... I'm sorry... the way this thing turned out. Yeah. I'm sorry, buddy. [Man] Come on. Relax. [Dan] Easy, boy. Easy, buddy. Easy. - Okay. - Could we, uh... Could you just use this? Says in the report this one's a biter. He won't bite you. But I might. [Woman, Man Chattering] - [Whimpering] - Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa. You can't take that off. He goes with dignity. Unbelievable. Hey, buddy. Hey. Hey. You comin' in? You gotta wear one of these hair things. No, but could you just give me a minute, please? Yeah. Sure. Easy. Easy, boy. Easy. It's okay. It's okay. - Hey, buddy. - [Whimpers] I know. I know. I'm sorry. Hey. It's just a sleeping med. Makes it easier for everybody. You just about done here? Yeah. [Clears Throat] Yeah. - [Whimpering] - Easy. [Sniffles] Okay. [Door Closes] [Exhales] [Exhales] - You believe this guy? - [Laughs] Feeling sleepy now, huh? That's my lunch! Hey! Hey, drop it.! Drop it.! Whoa, boy. Easy, boy. It's okay. Watch it! Watch it! Hey! Come here! [Barking] Hey! Eas... Aw! Aw! Hey! Aw! Stay, boy. Stay. I'm comin'! I'm comin'! All right, boy. Come here. Come on now. I got a treat for you, huh? [Whistles] All right. No. - [Barking] - Hey! Hey! Come on! Stupid mutt! Aw! [Grunts] [Engine Running] [Panting] [Device Beeping] He could've used it to slash himself. I mean it's possible, right? It's just a piece of barbed wire fencing. One of the workmen probably just tossed it aside. Even if there were once prints or tissue traces... the river's long since washed it clean. What about that surveillance video that your people are working on? What about that? The Forest Service didn't probably maintain the security cam at that site. We'll see if Photo Digital can salvage anything. - [Clicks Tongue] - Mind a little advice? You're looking for something because you want it to be there. Well, it ain't there. I even checked the wound profile for you... but there's nothing inconsistent with dog bite. I'm looking at a dog attack, Dan. Textbook. [Exhales] Sweetie, he'll be here. Highway's probably jammed. I wanted to be with him so bad. I know. Me too. Your dad needed... I don't know... privacy. From us? I don't get it. Dad. Hi. Are you okay, honey? Do you want to talk about it? Julia cooked dinner. Something special. Yeah, but I'm... I wish I had an appetite, honey. But I'm just... really tired. It's those stuffed potatoes you like... the ones with the special caper thingies. Sweetie, let's let Dad rest a little, okay? I'm sure he'll be good and hungry later. He didn't kiss you, Mom. [Loud Clatter] [Barking] [Grunts] [Barking] [Barking] Hey! Chicken! [Mutters] [Sighs] [Vehicle Approaches, Stops] Oh. Hey, there. Is this the Harding residence? Yeah. Who are you? We're from the Clarion, darling. - I'm looking for your daddy. - Why? I just want to ask him a few questions is all. - About that guy who says Ace attacked him? - There you go. - He's lying, obviously. - Uh, excuse me? Ace would never hurt anyone. You can write that down if you like. You're Officer Harding's official spokesman, are you? - Spokesperson. - I see. Tell you what. I will write that down, and you run and get your daddy. My dad doesn't want to talk to you. - He's busy. - [Laughs] You know, I am getting just a little bit tired of this. Your daddy's wonderful dog... tried to kill an unarmed citizen... and the people of this town deserve to know the facts. Don't you think? Your job is to get people to open up and talk about stuff, right? Uh, ye... Yes, that's part of it. You sure don't do it very well, do you? [Chuckling] Uh... [Clears Throat] - [Camera Beeps, Clicks] - Thanks. [Sighs] [Men Chattering] - [Barking] - Whoa! [Man] That's weird. [Mom, Off-key] (music) Whoo-hoo (music) (music) You got me right from the start (music) - (music) Caught me hook, line and sinker, babe (music) - Mom? - [Music] And stole my heart, Whoo... (music) - Mom! Oh. Sorry, honey. I can't hear a thing with my tunes crankin'. Sweetie, what is it? I'm really worried about Dad... - [Sighs] - How sad he is. He looks so depressed. It's... I don't know... scary. Well, honey, he needs time to adjust. I know. - You know what I wish? - What do you wish? I wish Dad was happy again. - You're sure you're ready for a new K-9? - I think I am, yeah. All right. We'll, uh... We'll get a few dogs in for you to test-drive. On one condition. "Officer Harding's youthful spokesperson... "identifying herself as Harding's daughter... denied that the police K-9 Ace ever attacked Mr. Torko. ' Julia? I don't want you or your daughter talking to the press. The D.A. 's muscling me to keep a lid on this until we get enough evidence to file. Fine. And Frank Burgess told me about your big find... the piece of wood with the barbed wire. Just stay out of the Torko case. - You're too close. You understand? - Yes, sir, Cap. [Sighs] [Copying] Hey, Sasha. How you doin', hmm? How you doin', buddy? You're a very good boy. Yes, you are. I bet you miss Ace too. Hmm? Yeah. I know. - And hup! - [Stopwatch Beeps] Go through. Come on. Come on, boy. - Through, through, through! [Whistles] - [Growling] - Through. Through, through. Through. - [Barking] [Sighs] - And hup.! - [Beeps] Through, throu... O-Over, over.! Over.! O... Uh. [Beeps] Get up, get up! Get up there! Go, go. Oh. Go up. Hey. Come here. Up! Up, up, up! Up, up. Oh. Up. - [Sighs] - [Beeps] You're a good-lookin' dog. All right. You're a good-lookin'pooch. [Barking] Mm-hmm. Great. - [Brakes Squealing] - [Horns Honking] [Barking] Honey, what are you doing? Uh... What's alum? You are not supposed to be reading that. Dad, how am I supposed to learn what it's really like to be a cop? You never let me go on ride-alongs with you. You never let me come to the station. There's a lot of bad things out there I don't want you exposed to. Okay? Aren't you proud of what you do? I am. Yes, honey. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that, but I have a lot of work to do here. Okay? That's what it's like really being a cop... feeling like you have a ton of homework to do and never enough time to do it. Does that sound like fun? So, what's alum? [Chuckles] It's a white powder... that cooks and food makers use to keep things like pickles crisp in their jar. It's really, really common. You can find it in just about every supermarket in town. But why is it found at every crime scene? Well, it's a very strong lung and eye irritant, especially to dogs. Which is why the bad guy we're trying to chase down... He's using it to throw off our dogs' noses. - Smart. - Yeah. What's an "ingression device?" Cop talk for the specific way a perp gains entry... in this case, a glass cutter. He cuts a hole in the glass, reaches inside... unlocks the door, window... whatever he can get his hands on. You think he's Goliath, don't you? It doesn't matter what I think, honey. The D.A. Doesn't think that we have enough evidence... linking him to the crimes... yet. - Dad. - Hmm? Why did you go back to where it happened? - What do you mean? - It says... Right here. "Officer Daniel Harding made an unauthorized inspection of S.O.I. '... "Scene Of Incident." "He unofficially presented Dr. Burgess with a 24-inch length of barbed wire... "attached to a fence post he speculated could have been used by Mr. Torko... to produce his serious dog bite wounds." You think Ace is innocent too, right? - Can I help you prove it? Please. - Honey. Maybe there's no evidence on the barbed wire, but he must have made some mistake. I mean, you always say that every bad guy makes at least one mistake... and it's up to the cops to figure out what it is. Hey, you wanna help me? Honestly? You'll let me get back to work here, honey. Okay? I have a ton of stuff to go through, and I really need to concentrate. Well, you're looking for a link, right? You need to link him to a crime scene or something. - I don't know, but... - Yeah, honey, I do, but here's the thing. I can't concentrate with you here. Okay? I need to do my work. It's my homework. And you do your homework. Okay? Thank you. I appreciate what you're doing. - (music)[Background: Loud Heavy Metal] - [Acetylene Torch Sparking] [Man] (music)I am nobody, I am no one (music) (music)I am nobody I am no one (music) [Chattering] Oh, thank you very much. [Chattering Continues] [Woman] ...so much. [Chattering Continues] [Man] I'll take five. - [Growling] - [Woman] Hey.! - Stop him.! He took the cash box.! - [Man] Hey, wait.! [Barking] - [Chattering] - [Woman] The children. [Woman Reporter] I understand you arrived, Deputy... and found the thief being detained by our mystery dog. [Deputy] Yes, ma'am, that's essentially correct. We arrived on the scene to find the perpetrator facedown on the ground... with his forearm held in the dog's mouth. And you recovered the cash box? Well, no, I didn't see any cash. Really? Do you mind if we check your pockets, Deputy? [Laughs] - [Doorbell Chimes] - [Deputy] We found the cash. We found the cash. And so one church's cash box has been safely recovered today. - The bake sale a complete success... - [Mom] I'll get it. All thanks to this mysterious stray dog's natural crime-fighting abilities. Dad! Mom! Come here! - Dan, are you there? - What, honey? What's the matter? I just saw Ace on TV... in Wenatchee. - He went to a church bake sale. - Ace went to a church bake sale? Not went went. I mean he caught somebody trying to steal a cash box... at this church bake sale thing. [Dan] Church thing? Honey, you're not making any sense. - I just saw him. He's alive. I would know him anywhere. - That's not possible. Dad, if anyone could pull off an escape from that K-9 clinic, it's Ace. - You know it's true. - That's nonsense. Okay? Why can't you just trust me for once? [Mom] Honey. Julia. It's not possible. Okay? I'm sorry, honey. You got that? You smell that? Huh? Okay, perrito. Good police work. Let's see if you can track down my boss. Okay? - Hey, Louise, check this out. - Okay. Este perro es increible. That's it, boy. Pick up the scent. He's onto something already. What do you got, boy? Where you goin'? What is it? Muy bien. Muy bien. Muy bien. [Spanish] Now watch this. He's a smart animal. [Spanish] This is real police work here. We should all be taking notes from this. He's a very special animal. I believe in you, man. You can do it. - Look at you. - See this? I believe in him. He's gonna change things around here. This is the start of a new era. Okay. - What the... - Sorry, boss. It was the doggy. - He smelled something suspicious. - Whose... - Good boy. - Where... Get him out of here! Bad boy. Okay, let's go. Move on. There's nothing to see here. - You okay with everything? You need a hand with anything? - No! [Julia] It's called alum... but I found that it's actually this chemical called potassium aluminum triphosphate. - Aluminum "try whose fate"? - Triphosphate. You should see the stuff it's actually used for. It's used to make dyes stick to cloth. They use it in water filters for ponds. It's even used in those white styptic pencil things... dads use to stop the bleeding when they cut themselves shaving. You're sounding like the world's expert on alum. My dad says cops never know which tiny detail... could be the big thing they're looking for to crack a case. - Hey, you know the Goliath robberies? - Yeah. They think the guy's Torko, but they can't prove it yet. - Yeah? - And my dad... He thinks Ace was framed. So do I. - Framed? - By Torko... to keep from going to jail. - [Footsteps] - L-I gotta go. [Gasps] Hmm. - [Man] Who'd you say this was? - Me? Oh... [Clears Throat] Um, I'm Captain Joe Porter's executive assistant. I'm just calling to confirm that you completed the euthanasia procedure... as required on one of our K-9s... a dog named Ace. Got a case I.D. Number? [Julia] Yeah. Yeah, I remember that one. So then it was taken care of? Oh, he went real easy like, if that's of any comfort to you, ma'am. Thank you. Yes, it is. I assume you do send the complete set of remains... because according to the state code... We send every flake and crumb. "Abso-posi-lutely." It didn't get mixed up with any other ashes, I hope. Oh, heaven forfend, no. That's why the furnace is vacuum-emptied after every procedure. Is there a problem? With the remains, I mean. Do you have a reason to think there might be? I run me a pretty tight ship here. Sure there wasn't a dog overboard recently? [Julia] Ow.! Remind me not to let you teach me how to drive. You mind telling me what you're doin' here? Dad, I can help you. I discovered something in the ashes. - The ashes? - Something that proves Ace might be alive. - Julia... - First I found a teeny tiny tooth in the ashes... that couldn't have come from a dog bigger than a beagle, for sure not from Ace. - Then you know how his weight is always exactly the same? - Yeah. Well, I did a simple dry weight/wet weight conversion on his so-called ashes... and it turns out it didn't at all jibe with his 122 pounds. But then the head guy at the police dog clinic... - said that he definitely sent every last bit of Ace's ashes. - Wait a minute. You spoke to the clinic in Spokane? Yeah. A-And then I checked the state civil code on the Web. And sure enough, the law is that they absolutely have to send all of the ashes to you. All of which makes me wonder... whose ashes are in this container. What? We did dry weight/wet weight conversions three chapters ago. [Chuckles] You are a very smart, very precious young lady. You know that? - Yes. Which is why... - Which is why you are gonna... - stay in this car until I get back. - But I'm... - What about the ashes? - Honey, good work. Very good police work, but it's not proof. That-That guy up in Spokane... He was a lazy jerk, and just because he didn't follow the state civil code... doesn't necessarily mean that Ace is alive. It just means that that guy was a lazy jerk. Okay, now, you stay here until I get back. Okay? - [Huffs] - [Car Door Closes] - Excuse me. You Boss Crowder? - Yeah. Officer Dan Harding. We spoke on the phone. I want to follow up a little bit about Mike Torko. Does he have any, uh, unexplained absences... anything like that? Well, he does his stints, all right... but I haven't had any problem with him as far as showin' up goes. - But? - [Clears Throat] Well, he's got himself quite a temper. Gets into more than his share of arguments. Lucky for him he's one wicked mechanic. Do you happen to have a work schedule for him... when he's been here, when he hasn't been here... for the last three months? - Let me check. - Okay. [Sparking] [Clattering] Here you go. Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. [Crowder] Yeah, no problem. [Torko] Hey. What are you doin'here? [Chuckles] Wait, wait, wait. Don't tell me. You came to ask Boss Crowder for a job. Uh, you're better off taking an after-hours night watchman gig... than workin' here. I mean, with all the ripsaws and metal pressers... it can get awful dangerous. Bow wow. [Chuckles] Mom, where's today's paper? - They're all here but today's. - I've got it right here, honey. Nuh-uh. That's for your dad. You can read it after him. - But I need it for my stupid social studies class. - Later. Right now, your dad and I are having a romantic brunch out on the patio. How do you spell "yech"? Same way you spell "Get lost, kid." Hilarious. Really and truly. [Laughs] Apple-smoked... your favorite. I know you don't like pulp, so I strained the O. J... 'cause, wouldn't you know it, the only O.J. They had at the store... - Lily. - What? I'm sorry I've been spoiling the party lately. I don't know what I would do without you. And don't you forget it, mister. I couldn't possibly forget it. Mom! Dad! Wenatchee County Sheriff's Department. May I help you? Hi. Hey, um, I'm just calling about the new K-9 you just hired. - L-I mean found. You know? - Excuse me? The K-9. The police dog? It was in the paper. - What about it? - Does the dog have a little round hole in his ear? You sort of have to check to the back of the ear to see it. Well, I would certainly have no idea. Well, could you, like, go look? It's a bullet hole, actually, from when he saved my dad. Uh, no, I can't just stroll away from my board and, uh, go look... because they've taken that dog to get distemper shots... city permit papers and Lord knows what all else. So, uh, why don't you just call back on Monday? - All right, sugar? - Well... - [Dial Tone] - [Huffs] - Dad, let's go. - Go? - To get Ace. - Julia. Just look. Honey, 75% of all police dogs are German shepherds. Yeah, but look at him. It's Ace. I know it's him. And it even says how they're all amazed... that he has all these natural police dog abilities. It's natural because he is a police dog, not a stray. Honey, it also says that the dog in question... is a she, not a he. Oh, well. That dumb reporter probably just made a mistake. You're always saying how the newspapers... are always getting details wrong in their stories and stuff. - Okay, look. Why don't we give them a... - Call? I already did. I asked this lady if she would check if there was a little round hole in their K-9's ear... and she couldn't because she said they were out getting the dog shots and permits. And anyway, she was treating me like I was some flaky little kid. Can't we just drive out there and see? - Honey, that's all the way out in... - Please, Dad? I've always dreamed of visiting beautiful downtown Wenatchee. - Thanks, Daddy. - All right, let me just go grab my... Right. All right, I'll go tell your mother that we're going for a trip. Why don't you pack us up some... - Thought of everything, huh? - Mm-hmm. [Chuckling] Okay, let's go. [Speaking Spanish] - [Whimpering] - Okay. [Spanish] Sit, sit, sit, sit. Sit down. Good boy. Okay. Mira eso, huh? Just take your time. [Spanish] [Dan] Honey, why don't you just kick back and rest a little bit? We're gonna find out soon enough, okay? Yeah, like I'm gonna rest when all I can think about... is we're only 24 minutes away from seeing Ace... assuming you're going 60 miles an hour. Fifty-five. Okay, fine. - Twenty-six. - [Chuckles] - I'll rest the extra two minutes. - Okay. I guess I'm just a little bit concerned... you're gonna be disappointed if it turns out that... - Well, you know. - You don't believe me, do you? I believe that you think Ace is alive. I know he's alive. Dad, you believe Ace never attacked Torko... - even though we have no proof, right? - Yeah. Honey, that's different. You know I'm right. Dad, you always said that there are important things you can't see or touch... but you should have faith anyway... like love, you said. Remember when I had to say that line in the Sunday school pageant... but I kept flubbing it? Yeah. "Blessed are those... who have not seen and yet believe." Well, if I can have faith that Ace is alive, why don't you? - Dad? - Yeah? Thanks for loving Mom again. I saw you kissing on the patio this morning. You were making up for when you didn't kiss her, right? [Chuckles] I guess so. I knew it. Listen, honey, I want to apologize to you for something. Remember when you were trying to tell me that you were sorry... - about what happened with Ace and the cabinet? - It's okay. No. No, it is not okay. I raised you to accept an honest apology. I was wrong not to accept yours. I'm sorry. [Barking] [Whimpering] [Barking] I remember I saw you on the talk show. - A couple of weeks ago, right? - Yeah. You and el perro. Como se llama el perro? - Uh... - The dog. - Oh, Ace. - Ace. Eso es. Ace. You and Ace are a very famous pair around these parts. Yeah, just like Sherlock and Holmes. - They were one person. - Que? Um, if the dog turns out to be Ace... I hope he hasn't been too much trouble to care for. No, no, no, hombre. Para nada. No. I'm keeping him out back in the garage for his own safety. [Speaking Spanish] I know he was a... highly trained K-9... dog... who was maybe lost... or stolen... or something. Of course, we get all kinds of lost critters that come through these parts. Una vez me adquirido... a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig. Just came sashaying up to my desk. [Snorting] Does he have a little round hole in his ear? - Who, the pig? - Uh... No, no. What she means is, if the dog is Ace... then he'll have a hole in the base of his left ear. - A bullet hole. - Oh. No. No. No, I don't recall seeing anything like that. I do recall one time, however... I saw a heifer with an arrow stuck halfway through her. Can we see him now, please? Ace, I mean. Uh, we just had a... We've had a long trip... and we're really anxious to see if the dog is, in fact... Of course. I'm... I'm-I'm so sorry. You're on your business, and here I am just talking nonstop. - Yakkity, yakkity, yakkity. - [Laughs] So... Yes. Yes, by all means. Please. - Please. - Thank you. [Whimpering] So I went back to Pet-A-Rama... to get a couple of pounds of ground chuck for the poor dog... because he looked so hungry. I thought maybe he was homeless or something. You know, the way he was looking at me and... El perro. Well, he must... [Ratcheting] [Radio Chatter] Okay, let's go. All right, bye. [Barks] - [Chuckling] - Oh. [Whimpers] [Man] Level it out. - Yeah, it's good. Put a little more... - [Dan Sighs] Not again. - How's it goin'? - Sorry about the delay, Officer. Shouldn't be too long. Tax dollars at work, huh? - [Man] Yeah, pretty much. - What exactly is goin'on up there? Oh, just more cars. More cars, wider highways. It seems every time I drive up this way, there's something goin'on. Well, hopefully this'll be the last time, huh? - Give it a couple of years and you'll zip through. - All right. Take it easy. - Have yourself a good day. - Ace? - What do you mean, Ace? - In that convertible. - Ace.! - I don't see anything. - Turn around. Follow him. - Honey, I can't turn around. - We're bumper-to-bumper here. - He just waved at me. - He waved at you? - Never mind. Just turn around. - We've gotta find that tow truck. - You just said convertible. No, no, no. The convertible was being towed by the tow truck. It was definitely Ace. He waved at me. I'm not lying. I'm not. I saw him. - Isn't it possible, honey, that you just... - Imagined it? - Yeah. - No way. Sweetheart, remember how sleepy you were gettin'? I told you to rest, and you didn't want to. You were falling asleep. I think you were asleep. Maybe you were dreaming it, honey... and you thought it was real. It just seemed so... so vivid. - I don't know. - [Man] Let's go. Let's go. [Horn Honks] Sweetheart, why don't you just lay back down and go to sleep, okay? Let's go. That's right. - [Girl] We lost. - [Girl #2] I know. That was such a great pass you gave me. - I know. - And I missed it. - But, like, that other one... - It's gonna be a long ride back to Everett. [Chattering Continues] We'll get 'em next time. Hey, you mutt, get outta my bus. - [Whimpers] - Go on, get. Come on. Go. Time to go. Come on, come on. Oh, it's a puppy. Oh, he's so cute. - He's a stray. - He's not a stray. You see that rope? - He must have gotten out of somebody's yard. - He could be our mascot. [Girl] If no one shows up to claim him, he could be our mascot. [Girl #2] He could really be our mascot. [Barking] [Barking] [Girls Laugh] [Laughing] [Girls Exclaiming] Oh, he's so cute. - [Laughing] - [Girls Hush] - [Laughing] - [Engine Starts] [Girls Giggling] Let's get this rope off, boy. - Good puppy. - Hey! Quick, get him out the window. I want the dog off the bus now. Right now. [Driver Gasps] [Girls Cheering] - He made it. - Yeah.! Whoo.! Come on, honey. Bedtime. - Mom. - Yeah? Why hasn't Ace come home to us yet? I did some calculations. It just doesn't make sense that he hasn't gotten here yet. I mean, he was 18 miles away from our house when I saw him on the highway four days ago. - You and your calculations. - He could have gone to the police station. But somebody's always there, and for sure they would have seen him, and... - Sweetie... - He's out there... somewhere. I can feel it. I just... haven't figured out where. Maybe it's time to accept certain facts. I don't like your facts. I'm gonna tell you something very important. I know you think you're helping Dad... when you tell him that Ace is coming home, but you're not. You're just making it harder for him. - But Ace is alive. - No, he's not. He's gone. Honey, when Dad looks into your eyes... and sees what you believe, naturally he wants to believe it too. He can't help it. The truth is Ace is gone. - No. - Yes. And it's a truth that we have to face... all of us, together. So let's help Dad. Let go of Ace and move on. - No. - Honey, it's what he needs from us. [Chattering] Hey. - Captain. - Dan. - What's goin' on? - Sorry to bring you in on a Saturday. Something you need to see. Frank Burgess just sent this over. Okay, look. There's... There's Torko. And here comes Ace. Now look. Torko grabs the post with the barbed wire... and at first he's just fending Ace off. Now here's the part. Now watch what Torko does with that barbed wire. Look at him. He's slashing himself in the neck. It wasn't Ace biting him at all. See? He's... He's cutting himself to shreds. Okay, now watch Torko... throw the barbed wire into the river. Exactly where you found it. Look at Ace. He's just trying to clamp down on the guy's forearm. Standard take-down. Clear as day. I'm sorry, Dan. You're sorry? Sorry. [No Audible Music] "Unfinished Business." [Julia] I just figured it out, Kenny. - Ace has unfinished business. - Your dog has my PS3 game? No. No. I found your game, all right. When I saw the title, I realized that that's what Ace has with Torko... unfinished business. He framed Ace and almost got him killed. Ace is zeroing in on Torko before he comes home to us. - Maybe. - It makes perfect sense. Don't you see? It's in his blood to get his man. - Where are you? - I'm gonna stake out his house. How do you know where he lives? I found his home address in my dad's crime report. Hey, you wanna join my stakeout? I have a soccer play-off in, like, five minutes, but I'll be home by 12:30. Julia. Be careful. Call me later. I'm not leaving until I find Ace. [Gasps] [Motorcycle Starts, Revs] Where is my... [Beeps] - Hey, I forgot my evidence book. - Don't you wanna know who won the play-off? Okay, Kenny, fine. Who won? We lost 5-2. But guess who scored the first goal? Congratulations, Mr. Beckham. Listen, I really need my evidence book. Do you think you could stop by my house and bring it? It's on my night table. I'm at 749 Dickens Street. - You know that alum Web site you wanted me to check out? - Yeah? Pretty interesting stuff here. - Like? - Like, listen to this. "Mixed with acetic acid, common alum is also used by metal manufacturers... and the petroleum industry for high-speed drill bit lubricant." Didn't you say he works a big drill press at the chopper place? Yeah, and I saw him squirt something on it too... - a milky liquid. - Cool. - Could be a link. - I'm gonna take a closer look around his house. Wait. Don't do anything until I get there. I'm just gonna see what I can see through the windows. - What if he's there? - He just left, with his lunch box. Which means he won't be back for at least a few hours, right? [Sighs] - Don't forget my evidence book. - Got it. - Bye. - [Beeps] [Grunts] - [Screams] - [Glass Shatters] [Gasping] What's up, man? - [Whimpers] - We seen the footage of you and that... and the cop dog on TV, and all... so we thought maybe you wanted a rematch. - [Yips] - [Laughing] Only this time it might be a little more even. That's funny. [Chuckles] Too bad I'm allergic. Hey. What you got there? - Nothin', man. It was a stupid joke. - No, there. In your jacket pocket. Get out. I said get out. I told you I can't have no thief up in my shop. I told you that from the get-go. - Don't expect no letter of recommendation. - I don't need a thing from you. Wow. Mmm. Hot bike. Hey, man, get your hands off my... [Gagging] [Groans] [Grunts] Hey, man, what... What are you doin'? Real hot. My bike! No.! Man! [Sniffs] Ugh. [Sniffs] [Sniffs] Hi, Dad. It's me. Call me as soon as you get this... because I just checked out Torko's house... and you're never gonna believe it. I found a bunch of stuff that will for sure help you link him to the crime scenes. Anyway, I'm just getting home now... so please, please, please get here soon so I can show you. Okay, thanks, Dad. Bye. Hey, you, I'm on my way to Dickens, but I didn't get... - [Julia On Cell Phone, Garbled] - You're where? I can't hear you. - This connection totally sucks. - I said I'm home now. - But guess what. - [Kenny, Garbled] I must have missed you... Because I was there five minutes ago to get your evidence book... but no one answered the door or anything. - Guess what I found inside his house. - You went inside? Links to the crime scene, that's what... alum powder, a glass cutter. The glass cutter, I'll bet. I've got tons of pictures on my digital camera to show my dad. I mean, it was totally creepy. The guy probably folds his dirty laundry in alphabetical order. I can't hear you. I must be in a bad cell area or something. - Tell me what your dad says when you show him everything. - Okay. - [Kenny, Garbled] - What? You're breaking up. Your dad... There was a motorcycle parked alongside your house. - What do you mean a motorcycle? - [Garbled] - Kenny. - You're breaking up. Bye. [Gasps] - Oh! - Sorry, honey. Shh! He's here. - Who? - Torko. - I think he's here in the house. - Honey, I'm sure you're mistaken. Mom, please. Just trust me. [Gasps] - My cell phone's in my room. - There's a phone here. - [Beeping] - It's dead. [Gasps] What are we gonna do? [Grunts] Funny. - [Door Opens] - Hmm? [Screams] Go, go, go! [Both Scream] I hear you like to take pictures of things that don't belong to you. - Say cheese. - [Grunts] [Screams] Come on! Run, honey, run! - [Coughing, Spitting] - [Whimpering] Damn it.! Come on.! [Screams] [Shouts] - Aah! - [Screams] [Growling] No.! Mom.! No.! - [Screams] - [Ace Whimpers] - No! - [Sobbing] Oh, no. Ace. [Whimpering] - [Snarling] - Aah! Ace! Off, off. Off. Freeze.! Police. - [Groaning] - [Handcuffs Snap] - You okay? - Yeah, we're okay. - You all right? - Dad, Ace is hurt. - Ace. - He's bleeding. Okay. Take it easy. Take it easy, boy. It's okay, buddy. - Call for help. - Okay. [Ace Whimpering] Okay, buddy. All right, buddy. Okay. It's longer than they said. Way longer. It's 23 minutes past how long they said it would take. Honey, we're all worried. But... I was right though. Wasn't I? Ace was alive all along... and he came back home to us. - I always knew he would. - [Door Opens] Well, we had a few bad moments back there. The glass shard caused his left lung to collapse... and if we hadn't have gotten that chest tube in there on time... Anyway, his lung is already re-expanding nicely... and there were no major vessel tears. - Does that mean he's okay? - Well, he'll need time to heal, of course, but he'll be fine. He's a strong dog. - [Laughs] - Wow. Dad, maybe you and Ace will be able... to go to the K-9 national competition this year. - You'd only have 97 days to get ready, but... - No. You and Ace would only have - Ninety-eight, if you count today. - Me? Yeah, well, somebody has to handle him, right? Excuse me, folks. He'll be under for a while yet. But you could come on back if you want to see him. Great. Don't you want to go see him? - Dad? - The doctor said he's gonna be just fine, sweetheart. No. Just... Thanks. [Dan Whistles] Come here, boy. Come here. Come here. Come on, Ace. That's my boy. - [Barking] - Ready? Go get it. Go get it. Go get it, Ace. Go get it. Good boy. Good boy. [Chuckles] I was thinking. Maybe we should go away this weekend. How would the entire K-9 unit fit into our car? [Chuckles] No. Just you and me. I'm sure they'll be fine without me for a few days. Anywhere you wanna go... Vancouver... - Victoria, Tofino... - Tahiti. Tahiti? For the weekend? Oh. Tahiti works for me. - Really? - Definitely. - I forgot about that. - Mm-hmm. - [Dan Chuckling] - [Barking] Good. Oh... - [Julia] Got it. - [Dan] Let's tell Julia. - Julia. - [Julia Laughs] [Julia] Ace, give it here. Give it to me. - [Lily] Hey, Ace. Good boy. - [Dan] Come here. Come here, boy. Come here.
