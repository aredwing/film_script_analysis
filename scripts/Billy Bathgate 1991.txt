The man who took out Vincent coll, who held Jack diamond's ear so he could put the gun in his mouth, who found the rackets he was too stupid to find for himself, who made him more than the low-down goniff that he is. The schmuck! Pulls me off the street right in front of my girl. Schmuck. Don't talk to Irving. Talk to me. Men talk. If they are men, they talk. They discuss these things. But you, I don't know, Dutch. I don't know what stinking womb of puss and scum and ape shit you came out of. Bo, you should understand I am past the madness part. I am past the anger. Don't waste your breath. Never paid your debts, Dutch. Never paid me what I was worth. You never paid nobody what they was worth. Bo, look who came along for the ride. The more I done for you, the more like a brother I was. I saved your life a dozen times! Kid, you like boats? I don't know yet. I protected you! I did your shit work and I did it like a professional. You always had a way with words. You got more words than me, being I haven't been to high school. But I got a good head for current events. And so I guess it all evens out. What's even? I made you a millionaire! You got more money than you know what to do with! I built this organization, the beer, the unions... The numbers! 20 million dollars a year... And you'd have run it like some goddamn candy store! Look at it this way, Bo. I'm the one sittin' here and you're the one sittin' there. Now who would you rather be at this moment? Come on, lady. It's all right, Irving. You can bring her up. No! No, Dutch! Feeling better? You can sit her down there, Irving. Come here. This is very good malt whiskey. Go ahead. It'll settle your stomach. This is between me and you. Leave her out of it. Bravo, sweetheart. Bravo. You know what you're doin', don't you? I'll bet you know how to do just about everything. It's over, it's done. Did you say something, Bo? You can see the trouble your Bo is in. Right, Bo? Show her how you can't do certain things anymore in your life. The simplest thing, like crossing your legs or scratching your nose. It can't be done anymore by you. Sure, he can scream, he can shout. But he can't lift his foot. He can't open his fly. He can't tell you what time it is. Little by little he's taking leave of his life. - Irving, is there a cabin? - Down below, aft, back end. Mr. "class act" Bo weinberg moves against his best friend. Against the man he works for. That's class. All right, miss, if you'd be so kind. Dutch. So tell me, I'm just curious. When did you two meet? How long have you and Bo been lovebirds? I have not had the pleasure of meeting you before tonight, but it's clear that Bo is in love. Irving. Put me out, Irving. I'm begging you. Put the muzzle to my head. I can't do that, Bo. Please, Irving. Sorry. I could give you a drink. Wanna drink, Bo? You listen to me, kid. You take some advice from old Bo weinberg. This man of yours ain't gonna last long. He's obsolete. You know what that means? Means he's finished, he's done. He's up against tougher guys than him and they're better organized. If you're as smart as they say you are, look out for yourself. You listen to old Bo weinberg. Hey... how'd you get into this, kid? Juggling. It was juggling that got me into it. There ain't been a beer truck around here for weeks. What does that mean? - What're you, stupid? - No. It means we can sit here 'til the cows come home. The dutchman's hidin' out. Dutch Schultz don't hide from nobody. Joey's brother works for Dutch and he said the heat is on. Joey faye's brother? How'd he get a job workin' for Schultz? He caught on. - How? - I don't know, he caught on. - Schultz noticed him. - Give me a cigarette. Ladies and gentlemen, I have the pleasure to present the phantom: The world's greatest juggler. The world's greatest jerk. He has come to us directly from a tour of the crowned heads of Europe. And he will juggle, not one, not two, not three, but four balls. Count 'em. This was never before attempted in the Bronx, New York, U.S.A. Shut up. Look! That's him. - That's Schultz. - Oh, my God. He drives a black packard. He's got a gun. It's very simple, but I think I got this whole thing under control. Then do it, counselor. Pay 'em off. Do it. What's he doing? Hey, kid, come here. Come here. Arthur... Arthur, can I just finish this point I'm trying to make? I know you don't like to talk about money, but I need about $10,000 more to cover these guys. I mean, it seems like a lot. $10,000 is a lot of money. But these are the best attorneys on the east coast. They have a lot of connections. If we do go to trial... This doesn't go to trial. A capable boy. Arthur, look, just look. Can you give me an answer? You want an answer? How come you're the cheapest lawyer I could find... And you still cost me all this dough? He always wants a little money. Hey, Billy! Did you see that? He just met Dutch Schultz. What do ya got there? Now he's a big shot. Let me look at it. Wanna see me double it? Wanna see me double it? Hey, Billy! Come on, share the wealth. Arnold! Arnold garbage! Arnold! - You still got it? - Yeah. Well, go get it. Does it work? Sure... I think it does. You gotta clean it up first. - Is there bullets in it? - No. See how the serial number's been filed off there? That's the sign that it's a mob gun. I'll give you three dollars. You have three dollars? Where did this come from? Dutch Schultz. Now give me my change. You lyin' son of a bitch. Ma, I'm gonna go out now. I'll be back in a little while. The government's after him, cops are after him, everybody's after him. And there he is, like he ain't got a care in the world. So he noticed you. So what? So what? You think a guy like me's got a lot of choices? You notice John d. Rockefeller offering me a job? Or the Yankees asking me to play shortstop? No. This is it. Becky, listen to me. You don't understand about a guy like Dutch Schultz. He grew up around here. He was a nobody... just like me. But he had brains and he had guts. And look at him now. I bet he's the richest man in New York. I mean, he's got the racetracks. He's got the nightclubs. He controls the whole liquor business. He's gotten into the numbers racket. I mean, Dutch Schultz is the number one... and he noticed me. I'm tellin' you, Becky, I know whatever happens to me in my life... it's gonna have something to do with Mr. Schultz. So what're you gonna do? I'm gonna find him. How're you gonna find him? Don't worry, I'll find him. Hey, Harry, how ya doin'? Great. Right on schedule. What's this? What's goin' on? Is this some kind of joke? Lulu. All you have to do is what you're supposed to do! All you have to do is make the deal! United States of America wants me to pay taxes. I'll pay the fucking taxes! It's not as simple as that. Stop with the papers and listen to me a minute. Look around you. What do you see in this place? I got 20 desks here, right? How many men do you see? I got 10 men, right? Those empty desks mean anything to you? Don't you understand every week this goes on... I lose money, I lose men to those dago scumbags downtown. You don't hold all the cards in this situation. What do you mean? I'm paying you an arm and a leg. I'm paying off half the judges and the cops in this town. What do you mean, I don't hold the cards? These are my favorite. This is the government. Al Capone is serving 41 years for tax evasion. We're gonna beat it, but it's gonna take money and time. You understand what I'm saying? - Who are you? - A kid with luck. Yeah? Well, we could use some. We haven't heard from George. Joey's flaked with me. Irving, I want to talk to you. You forgot the coffee. - That's it for today. - Okay. Wipe the board clean. All right. You play the numbers, kid? No, sir. - Good. Got a mother? - Yes, sir. Don't let her play the numbers either. But I'll tell you what. I'll put you onto a sure thing. A horse? The world is numbers, not horses. I'm gonna tell you how much money you got. If I'm right, I win it. If I'm wrong, I'm gonna match it. Then you're gonna have double what you had. Now count your money. Don't let me see it. I know how much it is. Good. Now double that in your head and add three, okay? All right. All right. Product that by five. - Product? - Multiply that by five, subtract six and tell me what you come up with. - 279. - Just lost 27 cents. Yeah. You might consider the study of numbers. Question. What's a 125th and 3rd? A street corner. There's a candy store. It's one of our numbers houses. Bitch. Let's get out of here. Otto sent me. Nothing I can do. I work for them now. You tell him that, hear? You see what happens when I try to do right? You can all go to hell as far as I'm concerned. All white men together. You tell him that, too. Sounds like Jack Kelly. I don't start these things. I'm just this good-natured slob... That people think they can walk right over. - You in a gang? - No, sir. No? How do you expect to learn anything? I hire from gangs. That's a training ground. - Hear of the frog hollow gang? - No, sir. That's where the original Dutch Schultz came from. He was the toughest street fighter that ever lived. They named me Dutch Schultz. Is was like an honorary thing. Most of the gangs now... Are just dumb kids mostly. Is that right? I think for the real training, you gotta go right to the top. Otto, you oughta listen to this kid and you'll learn something. Thanks. What? Jack Kelly's gonna be at the big Ben barber shop tomorrow morning at 9:00. Good. We'll let Bo handle this. You give him a ring. I tried to get Bo for two days. I can't find him anywhere. Where the hell is he? He's supposed to be minding the store. Kid, I want you to be at Broadway and Nassau at 9:00. What do I do? What you do is you don't ask any questions. Extra, extra! Get your "daily mirror." Kid. Mr. berman. - Is that the car? - Yes, sir. Extra, extra! Get your "daily mirror." New n.R.A. Upsets labor board. - You sure that's him? - Yes, sir. I'm gonna have a talk with Mr. Kelly. Wait 'til Bo gets here. I don't need Bo for this. Not now. I'm just gonna talk to him. Gangland murder. Barbershop slaying. Gangland murder. Barbershop slaying. Grisly? There was nothing grisly about it. It was a professional piece of work. It was neat, clean, end of story, good-bye. They're never gonna think it was you. So how did I know it was the dutchman right off the bat? It's good to see you, Bo. We thought you was dead. Obviously I ain't. You couldn't wait 24 hours? Couldn't wait 24 hours for me to come home and do this right? Believe me, it was done right. Where were you? I called around. He was with some broad. She's no broad. This was a real lady. Where'd you take this real lady that's more important than business? Wherever it was, she wasn't complaining. You could've checked in. We never know where you are. You're always with some dame. We're running a business here. Arthur's going on trial. You're supposed to be in charge. Got some complaints about the way I'm running things, Otto? All Otto is saying, if you're gonna get shacked up, fine. But we didn't know where you was so we couldn't reach you. The way you handled it wasn't too fuckin' smart, that's all. - That's all. - Look at it this way. You're the one on the lamb and I'm the one on the town. Who would you rather be at this moment? Know what I mean? Pack up all my care 'n woe Here I go singing low Bye-bye blackbird Where somebody waits for me Sugar's sweet so is he Bye-bye blackbird Hey, kid, take this to Mr. Schultz. Oh, what hard-luck stories they all hand me Make my bed and light the light I'll arrive late tonight Blackbird bye-bye You didn't know I could do that, did you? Yeah, that's right. What? Bo weinberg's double-crossing us. He met with one of the other gangs. He offered to cut them in on our whole operation. That's a lot of shit. I can't believe that. Meeting took place on the 10th. Saratoga, piping rock casino. The barber shop was on the 10th. Why we couldn't reach him. He said he was shacked up. But he didn't say who with... or where. No, no, no. It doesn't make sense, Otto. Why would he do something like that? Arthur, nobody thinks you're gonna beat this rap. Word on the street is that you're as good as dead. - Bo's lookin' to the future. - What are you talking about? You know how far back we go. Come on... what do you want? Yes, sir. The bartender asked me to give you this. Thank you. Good day, Mr. weinberg. I'm going to the bathroom. Okay. Kid? Kid. Mr. weinberg. Dutchman got you workin' late? Yes, sir. Where you from, kid? The Bronx. Bathgate Avenue. Jerome Avenue. Say hello to a friend of mine from the Bronx. Hello. Mr. weinberg, this is 20 dollars. Yeah. Get some sleep, kid. Thanks! Thanks a lot. You know what a loyal man is worth these days, kid? His weight in gold. You remember that. He lied to me, Otto. He lied to me. I will take him down and that is a sacred vow. You have to be careful. Bo has many friends. He was the best. I never had to tell Bo to do anything twice. I would say it one time, and bang, it was done. And it was done right. I promise you, kid, it was done right. You get high marks for this. Hey! It's the fire inspector. Must be payday. Open up! He had balls. Nobody had balls like Bo. The manager's not here. Come back later. I remember one time. The guineas wanted him to take out one of their guys. And you know what he done? He put on a cop's uniform... Where's the manager? You can't come in here. What's the matter? You got a problem? You want your payoff? I'll give you a payoff! Get this load of shit out of here. Fuckin' fire inspector. What's next, the mailman? I can't take it, Otto. I can't take it when it's all over the street. We're gonna have to get hines to deal with this. Do what you have to do. If I'm going to trial, I'm not going in this city. I want it in the boondocks. Oh, Bo, what have you done to me? Close the door. Mr. berman, what are we gonna do? He killed that man. Forget it. You didn't see anything, hear anything, nothing happened. Even think about it again, you're as good as dead. You understand? Now listen to me, kid. You're the upcoming generation. Things are gonna be different for you. You need different skills from these guys. Be streamlined, not so much fire in the street. When that happens, if you're lucky you may not have to kill anyone. What that means is... No one will have to kill you. Let's go. Get the lights. Here's your salary. 12 dollars. Now this 50 dollars is my money. Want you to buy a new pair of pants, nice jacket, shirt with a tie, pair of shoes with laces. It's a personal embarrassment to me to see the way you dress. I want you to get a valise to put the clothes in. - Buy something for your mother. - Where am I going? Mr. Schultz is havin' a trial comin' up, and we have decided... That he'll get a better deal if the trial takes place upstate. Is that all right with you? And I want you to buy a book to read. What do I need a book for? Are you gonna do what I tell ya or give me a hard time? Mr. berman, who is this man you're meeting? You wanna stay in the crime business, kid, you gotta stop asking all these questions. His name is hines. He's a district leader for tammany hall. He's on our payroll. Takes care of problems like this. I'm telling you, these guys ain't like anybody you ever met. They want something, boom, it gets done. And the money, you've never seen money like this in your life. How much money can you spend? That ain't the point. Let me tell you, money can do anything. I bet you never had anything in your life that somebody else didn't wear first. Here. Get yourself something nice. Come on, Arnold, we're having a party. Where? Where do you think? Just don't break anything this time. Hello. Mr. klein, how are you? Lookin' good. Mr. rosen, lookin' good. - How are you? - Very good. Girls, girls, girls. - Hey, Charlie. - Hello, Billy. - Hey, Mrs. Thomas. - Hello, Billy. Billy, don't you look swell. Thank you. Hi, ma. I got a job. Thing is... It's in the country. Upstate. It's just for the summer. Ma? This is for you. Billy, look at you. The richest man on bathgate Avenue. Let's go to work. Irving. Miss, this way. What's the matter? Come on. Good evening, Bo. Leave her out of this, Dutch. This must be love. What is your name, miss? Lola. Her name is Lola. That can't be. I know all the girls named Lola. You must be Arthur. Kid, go see what he's doin'. He doesn't have no respect. Go see if she's all right. Do what I told you. Go see if she's all right. You know what I'm talkin' about, don't you? I mean, you don't care about what's dead, do you? 'Cause I'm tellin' you right now, except for a few details, he's dead. Can you understand that? You can forget about the dead, can't you? I think you've forgotten already, haven't you? Well? I'm waiting. It's either a "yes" or a "no." I... I... What? I'm sorry, I can't hear you. What? Yes. Oh, that's too bad. That's too bad for Bo. If I thought you loved him, I might've changed my mind. Okay, kid, take the lady to her apartment. Don't let her make any phone calls. Although, I don't think she'll try. She'll pack some things. Stay with her until I come back. Somebody will call you up on the house phone to bring her down. You got it? Have you ever seen such a terrible night? Good evening, Mrs. Preston. Drew? I have to pee, Harvey. I thought you were out for the evening. You all right? Drew. Tell me what you've gone and done. You didn't ditch him? I thought you were so wild about him. I don't want to talk about it. It's all right with me. I'll be going away for awhile. You can't mean it, going away. Where? For how long? We're supposed to be going to the willet's this weekend. To say nothing of dinner tomorrow evening with Dwight, which was your idea to begin with. Darling, you'll just have to make excuses for me. There are certain proprieties to be maintained. You are my wife, after all. Harvey, what's the point of making a fuss? There's a certain limit. Scandal isn't the point. You're gonna get in over your head. Then what will you do? I'll expect you to come to the rescue. Get me another drink, please. If that's my gangster, tell him to wait. Mrs. Preston, you got a first name? Drew. Drew? You're the first drew I ever met. You're the first Dutch. All right, we have 28 days before the trial. That means 28 days... To show these folks that Dutch Schultz is one of them. Starting off, we call him by his real name, Mr. flegenheimer. We're plain folks like them who got the government on their backs. They understand that. We don't get into fights. No feeling up the chambermaids. From now on, you eat with your mouth closed. This is horse shit. No foul language, booze, dames, or fighting. It's different from the city. These are decent people. Make sure you act decent. Where's the book? I told you to bring a book. Either you listen or you go back to the Bronx. Take this to Mrs. Preston. Is that coffee? Yes. Thank you. I once chanced to meet Alvin pinkus. He always said banks was best. Look where he is now. Did all right. Going for the dough, the one place that's under lock and key. You gotta be stupid. Stay with the car, Lulu. You got anything to tell me about the girl? Her name is drew Preston. You want to explain what she's doin' here? She's the kid's governess. The properties are being observed. - The what? - Wait a minute. There. You look handsome. That's a compliment. Please, come in. It's very nice to make your acquaintance. May I introduce my business manager, Mr. berman. Mr. berman. And Mrs. Preston, the governess of my prodigy. It is a pleasure to meet you. I'd like to open a checking account for $10,000. The rest in savings. Of course. Excuse me a moment. I'll get my head accountant to take care of the paperwork. Honey, you are looking at the patron Saint of the boondocks. If I make a tiny criticism, promise not to get sulky? - What? - It's "protege." - What did I say? - Prodigy. It means child genius. Thank you very much, Mr. flegenheimer. We don't often get famous people in our little town. I know what you mean. Mr. berman will stay here and work out the details. No problem. What's the younger generation reading these days? Yes. - What's your name, son? - Billy... Bathgate. With youngsters like this, we don't have to worry about the future of this country. No, we don't. I hope to see you soon. Yeah, right. Let me see that, will you? What do you got? What is this? Was this your idea? Don't look at me. - This was your brainstorm? - Yeah. What'd I tell you? The kid's all right. He's my prodigy. I know how to pick my words. Get in the car. We ain't got all day. Come on, Mickey, I got an inspiration. Inspiration, right? What kind of church is this? It's catholic. They put a lot of work into this place. G-58. I-17. - G-51. - Bingo! And especially Mr. Schultz for so generously donating... A special cash prize of 25 dollars. 10 chickens and the two crates. 25 cents, now 30, now 40. I'll give $100 for the chickens. How much you want for the farm? I tried to talk to him, but it's impossible. Sometimes he won't listen at all. Looks like he's goin' for the farm vote. I hope this helps for now. If you need more later, I'll do what I can, Mr... - Chambers. - Chambers. God bless you for what you're doin'. Mickey! - Who's next? - Well, Dixie's here. What're you doin' here? Hello, Arthur. Give me some more coffee. What are you coming up here for? - Arthur, we need to talk. - Why didn't you call me up? I didn't want to tell you this on the telephone. The government turned down the offer. So double it. It's the prosecutor. He's determined to go to trial. Shit. So we'll take care of him too. He can't be bought. He said that? What do you want? I got your coffee. Why are you always listening to what you shouldn't be listening to? Will you go upstairs... And tell Mrs. Preston to take you to a museum. Get out of here! Go to the zoo! Do something useful. I need the suite. Mrs. Preston? Mr. Schultz said I should wake you. He said he needs the room. He said we should go to a museum or something. Mrs. Preston, I don't think this was such a good idea. Mr. Schultz didn't say anything about this. One of the things about being in a gang is you gotta follow orders. Everything they asked me to do, I done it. Did it. I mean it, Mrs. Preston! I think we oughta go back. Mrs. Preston? Mrs. Preston! Mrs. Preston, you all right? How was it when Bo died? Could you tell me, please? You got him? Hold on to him. Take care of my girl, kid. Don't let him hurt her. Get her away from him before he hurts her. You hear me? Promise me. - Say it! - I promise. Mrs. Preston! Did he really ask you to protect me? Yes. Strange... That he would think that I couldn't take care of myself. And you promised him you would? Yes. You always keep your promises? Do you have a girlfriend? - Yes. - Yeah. She's a very lucky girl. We don't appreciate his lady friend's presence here. What do you think the odds are I'll beat this rap? I wouldn't bet on you. We come up here, take the time, the trouble, the effort... To set things right so you make a good impression... And you bring along this... broad. All right, you made your point. What? She was there when Bo got it. That is correct. She never should have got on that boat and she never should have got off. When the time comes... I'll smack her around a little. And that's all it will take. Just don't fall in love with her, Arthur. Boy, you are some picnic tonight. I said, don't fall in love with her. - Who's out there? - Nobody. Jesus Christ. You scared the shit out of me. It's nothing. Citizens of onondaga are hardworking people... Who usually get the short end of the stick. But our forefathers have dealt you a couple of cards in your favor. You know the law is nothing but what the people say it is. I have great confidence that the people in this town... Know that I hold the same virtues of right and wrong. And if I just may wax poetic for a moment... Mrs. Preston, you gotta be careful. Otto saw us. I mean it, Mrs. Preston. You gotta watch out with these people. Why? They don't like it for anybody to have something on them. Do I have something on them? Do I? You were on the boat. That makes you a danger to them. If I have something on them, then so do you. Yeah. You're right. If I don't catch on, then I will have something on them. If Mr. Schultz decides against me, that's it. There's nothing anyone can do. Let me tell you something about your Mr. Schultz. He's a very ordinary man. Now you've got something on me. Who's the better shooter? Irving, he got them all in there. Nothing's wasted. It ain't lady's embroidery. Don't have to be neat. You got the time to set it up and you need a clean hit, you send Irving. But if you're in a tight spot, you want Lulu next to you. Boom-boom-boom. It's all over in a couple of seconds. This is as far from where I come from as you can get. Where's that? The Bronx. Bathgate Avenue. We live in a tenement. Who's we? My mom and me. She works in a laundry. Gets $4 a week. You probably spend more than that for lunch. Maybe you don't appreciate the position you're in. What position is that? You're Mr. Schultz's girl. No, I'm not his girl. He's my gangster. Besides, you're the one who's been looking after me. You seem to be doing all right on your own. Meaning? What? Meaning? Tell me. Come on, tell me. - Because... - Yes? Mr. Schultz is a pushover for blondes. - How do you know? - I read it in the paper. I don't read the papers. How you supposed to know everything you need to know... If you don't read the paper? What is it I need to know? Maybe if you don't work for a living, you don't need to know anything. Some of us are trying to learn a trade. We have to be up on the latest developments. Here's the latest development. Arthur, do you renounce Satan? I do. - And all his works? - Yes. - And all his pomps? - Yes. - And all his allurements? - Yes. Mr. Luciano, please place your hand in position. As I said, Mr. Luciano... Thanks very much. You're welcome, sir. I'm honored to enter the catholic church... On a ticket with such a man as yourself. I appreciate your coming. Where's your associate, Bo weinberg? I'm sorry. He couldn't make it. That's too bad. I never met him, but I hear he's a man of character. - A man to respect. - Yeah. I'm sure he would like to have met you too. I'm making a party later. I'd be happy if you could... I wish I could, but I gotta get back to the city. - Take care of yourself. - Yeah. Thank you for coming. You honor us with your presence. Oh, is that where you went? Yes, a friend told me. You're late. You were supposed to be here this morning. It's a long drive, Otto. Take off your hat. Where's Dutch? I ain't got all night. Excuse me. Mr. president, where were ya? This is a big day for me. Did you tell Julie Mr. Luciano showed up? You were supposed to be here a long time ago, Julie. You're lucky I'm here at all. Nice to see you. How's the drive? Father maclnerney. I'd like you to meet Julie Martin, my associate. What do you do? Mr. Martin is president of the metropolitan... Restaurant and cafeteria owners association. - You're in the finest in town. - That's your problem. You're in the country now. Mind your manners. Tell me why you got me to drive here so I can get out of the country. You got a big mouth. You know that? I've got business to discuss, so if you'll excuse me. Otto. I earned, I earned. The money I paid, expenses. What costs are you talking about? I didn't dream up the protection rackets so you could steal from me. You didn't dream up nothing. I run 'em for ya. Don't raise your voice. You've been yelling all night. I'm the one with the baseball bats. I'm the one who squeezed two million out of those restaurants. Don't you feel obliged to make it good? Make what good? The 50 thousand Otto says is missing. Otto's wrong. Otto's wrong. He says you've been skimming. No, not skimming. - Money I'm entitled to. - $50,000 worth? You're damn right. He's entitled to my $50,000? - Let me tell you, pal. - You tell me, pal. I got every maitre d' going to his knees... When I walk in because of who I am. Let me explain something to you in plain English. Oh, my God. Kid, see if you can find the shell. You killed that man right in front of me. He stole $50,000. I'm a member of the state bar. Calm down, Dixie. Everybody's asleep. - I was seen with him. - He left after that. - We have witnesses, relax. - Relax, he wants me to relax? Lulu, take Dixie to his room. Lock him in. I have to walk into a courtroom tomorrow. You'll get over it. Kid, bring the elevator. Make sure nobody sees ya. What's the matter, Irving? It's not coming out. What the hell you doing? What's going on? Be quiet. Go back to sleep. Listen, nothing's happened. Do what I tell you. Don't ask about it. Forget it. Now I've got something on you. Hello, operator. There's been an accident. I need a doctor. Sure, I'll hold on. Hello, doctor. We've had a little accident. I'd appreciate it if you could come over. Thank you. No, it's nothing serious. How long? That's fine. Room 35. You don't have to break his fucking nose. Take your hands away. Come on. Put your head down. Let me do the work. All right? That's good. Just relax. A little more over there. That's it. That's a good boy. Just let it drip. All right. Give him a handkerchief and get him up. Here. Up you go. Listen, you don't have to worry about the dutchman. I take care of my own, okay? Don't think twice about Martin. He tried to take what was mine. You, I love. And these guys. And I would do anything for them. They know my word is my bond. Look, not a complaint out of him. Is that a trooper? He takes the good and the bad. He takes all. Very good. He wants to be in the gang. You're in the gang. Put the heavy ones up front. Otto wants to see you. Otto wants to see you. Come in. Put some ice on that. Close the door. I want to talk to you about Mrs. Preston. She has seen something in you. I wonder if it's the same thing I see. I don't know what she sees. Mrs. Preston wants to be in court to see the show. Can you imagine what's gonna happen when the newspapers get ahold of her? - Mr. Schultz is a married man. - Mr. Schultz is married? We're all married. We've got families to support. This has been a tough son of a bitch for all of us. Listen, I want Mrs. Preston out. And I want her out of here fast. She can go to saratoga, lake George. She can go to Hong Kong. I don't care where. I want her out and I'm depending on you. Do you want me to leave? The way Mr. berman... I don't care about Mr. berman. There'll be a lot of reporters. Is that what you want? I want to hear it from you. They're gonna ask questions. - Do you want me to leave? - It's for your sake. Do you want me to leave? No, I don't. It's polite to knock, Arthur. Am I missing anything? Mr. berman is right. I'll be going to saratoga. I'll be taking Billy with me. Is that all right with you? I asked you a question, kid. Now, everybody's happy. Mr. Schultz, you worried about the trial? No, I've been in worser spots than this. How does it feel to be public enemy number one? I'm no public enemy. So what are you? - Public benefactor. - How is it that you... Were arrested 11 times before the age of 19? Those are cases of mistaken identity. Every single one. Is this a case of mistaken identity? This is minor stuff. Are you sure about that? I never killed nobody. I never caused nobody to get killed. That's all the questions we can take. Thank you. All rise. Court is in session. Please be seated. I'll handle this. Berman told me Schultz owns a piece of this. He said they've taken care of everything. Absolutely. Welcome back, Mrs. Preston. Thank you, Charles. Good afternoon, Mrs. Preston. Mrs. Preston. We're always delighted to see you, Mrs. Preston. Hello, francoise. I've kept your suite. If you need anything, please ask. Mr. bathgate, your room is there. And Mrs. Preston... Good night, Billy. Good night. I won't tell him if you won't. It ain't funny, Mrs. Preston. You think Schultz is an ordinary man. He's not. He's a maniac. This is how people get themselves killed. What way is that? They don't stop to calculate the odds. They don't stop to think. Can you calculate the odds? Yeah. Yeah, I used to. I used to think I was one in a million. I had my wits. Whatever happened I would be fine. But now I... I've lost my wits, my place. Listen to me. You're smarter than he is and braver. You'll live longer if you're not afraid. Oh, my poor Billy bathgate. You made a promise to protect me. I'm not making it easy for you, am I? No, ma'am, you're not. Are you awake? - Can you hear me? - Yes. I'm having breakfast with the gang. - What? - No, no, my gang. Here, I've written it all down for you. Meet me later at the track. - Hello? - Where were you last night? We called. There was nobody there. Mr. Schultz doesn't like that kind of thing. - Something I ought to know? - We had dinner at the club. Mrs. Preston met friends, silly people, nothing. Make sure she's at the track in her box by the 3rd race. Box number 50. Why? What for? Don't you know when somebody's trying to look out for you? You don't have to sit in her lap. Got it? Jesus Christ. Operator, get me the savoy Plaza hotel in New York. Savoy Plaza? I'd like to speak to Harvey Preston. Mr. Preston, you don't know me. I'm calling from saratoga. Can I have a clubhouse ticket, please? Yes, sir. - 35 cents. - Keep the change. Excuse me. Excuse me, please. Hey, come here. I want you to take these flowers... - Mr. Wilson. - Phil. Good afternoon, ladies. Just popped up in the Atlantic. I gotta talk to you. Something's gone wrong. You're in a lot of danger. Don't be melodramatic. This is not a joke. Aren't they the most beautiful things you've ever seen? Who do you like in the next race, Charlotte? Flowers for Mrs. Preston. No, look at these. Come on. Come on. Come on, royal Anna. Billy, there was something I wanted to tell you. Do you remember that man who came to church? Which man? The one at Schultz's baptism. The one he respects so much. - Yes, Luciano. - I've met him before. Where? With Bo? I was drunk. - Did you tell Mr. Schultz? - VNo. You think I should have? Go, royal Anna! Go! Come on! Go, royal Anna! Go! Come on! Go! Oh, damn. - I'm gonna go bet. - No! I'll do it. You stay here. Put $50 to win on phantom fox. - Satisfied? - Don't get up. Don't leave until I get back. What if I have to pee? I'll bring you back a can. I love you, Mrs. Preston. Carter! Hello, drew dear. What's the rush? I thought I saw Irving. You did. Good to see you. Fancy meeting you here. I hope so. - Oh, hello. - Excuse me. - Carter. - Drew. Darling! - Harvey. - Harvey. What are you doing here? I've been looking everywhere. I got the damnedest call. What the hell's going on? It's the husband. Come on. You should have told us. How was I to know? What's this all about? It's the husband. Come on. What's with the troopers? The guy's a big shot. The kind of stuff big shots do, I guess. You didn't see this coming? Sure, like I saw it coming with Lulu. I don't get it. She must have figured out something. She didn't know nothing. She seem scared to you? She's not like ordinary people. She's not scared of anything. - Have you reached a verdict? - Yes, we have, your honor. Will the defendant please rise? How do you find the defendant, guilty or not? We find the defendant not guilty. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Irving, how... - Yes, I'm good. - You okay? - Yeah. Come on in. Is Mr. Schultz here? He's upstairs. I'm sorry about your nose. It was an accident. It's all right. Mr. Schultz is waiting for you upstairs. He wants me to go up there? Yeah, have a good time. Hey, look who's here. Close the door, will ya? I'd like a little privacy. - Did she say anything? - Who? - Who? - Mrs. Preston? Yeah, I think that's the lady's name. Yeah, she said she liked you... Very much. She said you have class. She said that? Who knows? In a better world, another time... What? They've issued another indictment. This time it's Dewey. It's the state. What is it with this state? What's next? City tax and after that Bronx tax? And then bathgate Avenue tax? It's not fair. We're gonna wait this out. I'm gonna get in touch with hines. We're gonna work something out. What does a man have to do, tell me, to be deserving of a break, to be able to reap the fruits of his labor? I'm gonna get Dewey. I am gonna get that bastard. You can't kill Dewey. It's too big. Not some fire inspector... I wanna know where he lives, what time he comes out... You cannot just go ahead... Otto, Otto! Don't you tell me what I can or cannot do. You work for me. You do as I tell you. Is that clear? All right, we'll be moving across to new Jersey for awhile. - Remember hines? - The fixer. Now, he's our last chance. There are 17 $1,000 bills in there. You tell him we're waiting for an answer in Newark. You should have seen him at the height of his power. He was a king back then. Never saw the real Dutch Schultz. Terrible thing when the money won't flow. Nothing makes me sadder than to refuse such a generous offer. Mr. hines, we need your help with Dewey. Mr. Dewey is a prosecutor who wants to be president. There is nothing I can do. Tell Schultz the business... Between us is over, I'm through with him. Mr. Schultz ain't gonna like this. He's always been generous with you. He deserves... He deserves nothing. That goddamn son of a bitch. What does he mean he won't take my money after all these years? My money's not good enough for him? He's a nothing. I'll stick it in his teeth. Forget about him. You got other problems... Don't tell me to forget! You promised me hines. You told me he'd take care of us. And now this? Is this how good your judgment is these days? Don't worry about Dewey. Dewey is as good as gone. You made an agreement with Luciano. I don't need his advice. He drove hundreds of Miles to stand up for you. He didn't have the decency to break bread with me. I don't trust that man. The man is sympathetic. Dewey's everybody's problem. Luciano knows... The dutchman gets knocked down, he's next. Meantime, I'm in the frying pan! Let me tell you for the final time. I will take Dewey out. Luciano will thank me. They will come and thank me for it. Mrs. Preston told me something about him. She thought she had seen him before. - What are you talking about? - She said... She said she was drunk. She didn't remember much. She was pretty sure it was him. She was with Bo. You hear this kid? This is what I'm talking about. This is why he is my prodigy. What else she tell you? What else went on with you two? All right. It's all right. Fine. He's a kid. I know. I'm calm. - Get up. - What did I do? That's for not telling me sooner. I tried. You should have come to me right away. I didn't hear the rest of you give me the word. Come on, that's not fair. Shut the fuck up. You're ugly and dumb and that's the truth. Otto, get Dixie. I want him here. Right, fix me a rye. Make it straight up. That conniving scum. Can you tell me how you know what he respects? I like something I tell ya. I don't like something I tell ya that. Ya cross me, I kill ya. Everything is clear. Everything is above board and honest, right, Irving? I see the whole world ganging up on me. I see the man who takes me into his church, the man who makes me his brother and embraces me. He's the same man who turns my Bo against me. Is that love or is that... The sicilian kiss of death? I don't care how many d.A.S come after me. They think I am finished, but I will show them. Come on, boys. Give me a smile. Dutchman's making a comeback. What is this? I asked for scotch. Can't you do one damn thing right? - But you just told me... - I'm fed up with you. - You're fired. - What? I don't want to tell you twice. Get out of here. - Why? - You know why? 'Cause you always want to know the reasons. Always poking your nose. Always interrupting. I'm sick of the sight of you. - Mr. berman... - Beat it. You can't fire me. I work for Mr. Schultz. Mr. Schultz does the hiring, I do the firing. Here's your severance pay. Get lost. What's the matter? Can't you get it through that Irish skull of yours... That we don't want you? We never did. Now, there goes a kid with luck. Get him, Charlie. Don't say a fucking thing. Hey, what's going on out there? Somebody call the police! Come on. All right, move. Come on. Go, go, go. Get down. Dixie? What the hell did you bring him here for? Dixie, what's going on? What's the matter with you guys? You double-crossed him. You sold him out, you son of a bitch. Bravo, kid. Lucky, will you tell these guys to get rid of this guy? - What's the matter? - He was at the chophouse. - He's a witness. - Sorry, kid. What are you gonna do when he crosses you like he did Mr. Schultz? Don't worry. He won't. Why don't you ask him about the money? What money? They were sitting on six million in cash. We didn't come across that kind of money, did we, Dixie? We've been through this. They were broke. They didn't have the money for payoffs, salaries. What about the safe? Otto had a safe. It was empty. That's not true. I saw it. It was full of cash. He's lying. You gonna listen to some punk? He's nothing. All he did was sweep up. They never let him near the money. How come Mr. berman gave me this? Here, here. This is a lot of money. Dixie, if you're holding out on me, it wouldn't be the right way to start a business. Maybe we ought to have a talk. Charlie, Pete. Lucky. Lucky, I told you the truth. This won't take long. What am I gonna do with you? You got brains, guts. I like that. But Dixie's right. You know too much. What am I gonna do? But I know things too. For instance, I know where bathgate Avenue is. I know where you buy your cigarettes. And I know the laundry where your mother works. So I guess it all evens out. Don't it? Take care of yourself, kid. Can I have my money? Sure. Why not? I'll be looking in on you from time to time. Just to see how you're getting along. Remember that. Hey, kid, you want a ride? No, thanks. I'll walk.
