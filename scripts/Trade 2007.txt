After they kidnap the girls, they get'm across the border As soon as possible and there they sell them, they do the same thing over and over again.

Ray not only investigates insurance fraud. But in resent occasions he also get's involved with... Detective Jefferson, no offense, but I like to hear the story from Detective Sheridan himself. The bottom line is, this girl will be auctioned of in a few hours, And I need to know what you guys gonna do about that auction, Look we've been monitoring this group for quit some time. We know where there Jersey operations are. Ray, the real problem is that this thing is global Even though this group might be based in Mexico City, they have operations all over the US.. And over every one of the continents. Their server for example, is located somewhere in Maldives. Their banking is in South Africa. There are many jurisdictions at work here CIA, State Department, the Interpol etc... etc... So what we do is follow the money, connect all the dots and we'll come up with the source. I get all that, but you know where the operation is in New Jersey. Yeah. But you can't be bothered and do anything about this little Mexican girl, You got bigger plans. That's what you're saying, or did I hear you wrong? Well gentlemen, if you excuse me? Thanks you We are the fucking Gringos, aren't we? Sorry? I said we are the fucking Gringos! Hi Patty, I'll be home in a few more days. I want you to take out a big hunk of money from our savings. But I don't wanna do it unless you say it's alright. I guess I wont have to ask what it's for. I'll tell you all about it when I get home, and I promise no more secrets. Have you found her? Karla? Karla that's her name? Yeah. Ray... if you find your daughter, I want you to bring her home. If I do, I will. Patty... Yeah? Thanks you You shouldn't thank me for loving you, Ray. Bye bye. Hey, hey, what's going on? I got us some money, you and me gonna do the auction. And what about your friend? Forget about him. Sure you got tell to me something Gringo. Why are you doing this? Who is it? It's my daughter. Your daughter? Yeah. This is what you've been looking for? That picture was taken 10 years ago, I really don't know what I'm looking for. I met her mother just after I was married To Patty my wife, and I was a happily married man And then I met Eleanore, and everything changed. She was... Oh she was so... wild and alive. I don't know what I was expecting but I was ready to give up everything. My marriage, everything, so stupid! Stupid... And then she met this other guy and... He was everything I wasn't, I mean... she found him exiting... and alive... Anyway and then she told to me, that she was pregnant with his child. And a... That kind of did it, I left and a... went back to Patty Did Patty take you back? Yep. Go figure. That would never happen in Mexico. Just a few days ago I get a knock at my door from a couple of officers and they told me that Eleanore has died. From an overdose. And they found this letter in her apartment with my name on it. That she's written 10 years before, but never sent. And she says she needs money, and that Karla is my daughter. Which I always... wondered about. You didn't know she had a daughter did you? I did. We had our ups and downs years We helped her out all we could, but she's always in trouble And the daughter? In foster homes mostly, but I always managed to get her back. After you. She went over the border to Juarez about ten years ago. Probably at the time when she wrote you that letter. Was her daughter with her? We have no idea. We do know, that she got back here two years later, The girl was gone And the house was still a mess. Did you... Did you ask her what happened to the daughter. She told us that she left her with her daddy. We didn't know what kind of daddy she was talking about? We couldn't prove anything, what are you talking about? We think, she sold the girl I don't know, but with junkies that happens She sold her. If I... if I gotten that letter 10 years before, everything would be different. Me and Patty always wanted a child. She's pretty, ain't she? Yes, she has beautiful eyes. Green.. Like her mothers. So, that's what you where doing in the house in Juarez. Well, by the time you climbed in to my trunk, I've pretty much givin' up on everything. But now I realized I gave up to soon. Which is something I do a lot of... I guess. Veronica, I hope, you are happy in heaven. If you can talk to Virgin Mary for me, And ask her to have a good and kind person buy me at the auction. I'm very scared. Please help me. Be well.
