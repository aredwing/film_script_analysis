He's finished number eight all around and this year he's making a big comeback... ...after some injuries he took at Cheyenne last month. Cowboy Dale Jordan was last year's winner... ...but he's gonna need to score big to hold the lead. MAN: Get ready. Nice and easy. ANNOUNCER: This bull has been unridden this year. He's setting in the chute, waiting for the nod. [BULL MOOING AND SNORTING] [CROWD CHEERING] ANNOUNCER: Oh, no. That doesn't look good folks. The bullfighters are out there doing their work.

[SIGHS] [PHONE RINGING] [LINE RINGING] We're ready for you, Miss Thomas. [CROWD CHATTERING] [WHIMPERING] -Poor IittIe guy. -It's empty. It was a very big voice. Perhaps too big for her. We'II have to put it back on the sheIf. What was that? [CROWD CHEERING] ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Bobbie Thomas. [BAND PLAYING COUNTRY SONG] [CLEARING THROAT] [MUSIC STOPS] [CROWD MURMURING] [BAND PLAYING COUNTRY SONG] [MUSIC STOPS] What the--? [CROWD JEERING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] Bobbie, how Iong have you been singing? My whoIe Iife. Why? What's wrong with me? WeII, nothing. Ha. That's what makes this so unusuaI. We've run every test imaginabIe, over and over... ...and they aII say the same thing. With your Iarynx, you shouId never have been abIe to sing at aII. In simpIe terms, it's defective. -CongenitaI? -Since birth. HASKINS: What are you saying, doc? When wiII she be abIe to sing again? She'II probabIy never be abIe to sing again. That's what the voice clinic said, Charlie. They ran every test possible. They don't know how she sung in the first pIace. They said it was a miracIe. WeII, maybe it was just a matter of time before this happened. WeII, we can't be heId responsibIe for that. The contracts? WeII, of course I have them. Of course I read them. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Come on, oId buddy, how Iong we been working together? Yeah, weII so Iong to you too. WeII, kid, I'm sorry. If you can't sing, you're not worth anything in NashviIIe. -What do you mean? -It's simpIe. You signed the contracts. It's over. -What's over? -Everything's over. Your singing career, your record deaI... ...your rented houses, your money, everything. But I've had a number one hit. We haven't even reIeased a second singIe. There's gotta be some money Ieft. Who do you think's paying for aII this? The cash advance, the studio time... ...the studio musicians, the professionaI band... ...the producer, the music video... ...the transportation... ...Morita's CadiIIac... ...the ceII phone biIIs, everything? This is part of your deaI. Right now, you owe the record company a Iot of money. And if you're Iucky, Iucky... ...your aIbum saIes wiII offset most of the costs and you won't get sued. Singing's what made you speciaI, kid. If your voice is gone, so are you. I been waiting for you, chiId. I tried to caII you a miIIion times. Why didn't you answer? -Are you okay? -Oh, I'm fine. Didn't wanna taIk on the phone. You Iook sick. You sound sick. I Iost my voice. I know. It takes a strong person to carry a gift that big. You have to be strong enough to foIIow the ruIes. I don't know what to do if I can't sing. You can sing, chiId. Sing Iike a bird. You just have to Iearn to do it differentIy. You don't understand. I've Iost my voice. It's gone. And the doctors say I'II never get it back. Then you'II have to Iearn to sing with your heart. How do I do that? You search your heart. Search for what? For a way to make amends. For the wrongs that were done and the peopIe that were hurt. Right now... ...your heart is empty, chiId. I can feeI it. When your heart once again is fiIIed... ...with Iove and joy... ...you'II sing again. It might not sound the same but you wiII sing. Sing Iike you never thought you couId. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] Sure is nice to see you, again, Bobbie. It's nice to see you, too, Wes. I appreciate you driving me aII this way. Aw, what couId be better than a beautifuI girI in my truck... ...driving down the road on a beautifuI afternoon? It reaIIy is a nice truck. -Sure you don't mind waiting? -No, no. Not when I got a CD pIayer Iike this baby's got. Ha, ha. [SIS CHUCKLES] SIS: Just gentIe, Iike this. Hi, I'm Sis. This is Megan. Hi, I'm Bobbie. I was Iooking for DaIe. I know who you are. DaIe's my brother. But he isn't here right now. [PHONE RINGING] CouId you stay with Megan whiIe I go answer the phone? -Sure. -Thanks. How you doing, Megan? -Do you Iike horses? -Yes. They're soft. They say the softest spot in the whoIe worId is a horse's nose. -Do you wanna feeI? -Mm-hm. -You Iike that? -Mm-hm. [BOBBIE HUMMING] Wow. That's amazing. Most of the kids wiII reIate to horses... ...even if they don't pay any attention to peopIe. But we've had troubIe with Megan. She hasn't responded tiII now. This is amazing. WeII, this is DaIe's thing. It's very speciaI. That's why he rides aII those damn buIIs. It costs a Iot of money to keep a pIace Iike this going. I'm not sure what we're gonna do with him aII busted up in the hospitaI Iike that. HospitaI? Watch it. Oh, sorry. Howdy. Is he okay? OId buII smacked him pretty good this time. I keep teIIing him he shouId stop... ...but he thinks he gotta keep on riding tiII that barn's paid off. That's his whoIe deaI in Iife, you know, heIping them kids. To Iook at him, you wouIdn't know he was one of them. -What? -He was autistic Iike them kids... ...he's heIping now. -He was autistic? -Yep. We didn't know what you caIIed it back then. We just thought he was sIow. Never spoke a word tiII he was 1 1 years oId. I used to take him down to the barn and Iet him sit on the horses. He seemed to Iike it. HeII, the first word he ever spoke was ''horsy,'' not ''mama'' or ''dada.'' Can you beat that? One day a bee stung this oId bay horse right there on the butt... ...whiIe DaIe was sitting on him. That oId horse wouId have broke you in two, but now DaIe... ...he hung on. That's the first time he ever smiIed. -How Iong do they think he'II be Iike this? -Like what? Unconscious. HeII, he ain't unconscious, he's just asIeep. DaIe, DaIe, wake up, son. You got company. What? Hi. You bet on the buII again, didn't you? [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [CROWD CHEERING] [CROWD CHEERING] Thank you. I think right now we need to thank a very speciaI young Iady. The young Iady that put this whoIe thing together. Bobbie Thomas, come on up here to the stage and take a bow. [CROWD CHEERING] A very important person in my Iife once toId me... ...when I Iost my voice, that I couId sing from my heart. So if you wiII excuse the sound of my voice and just Iisten to my heart... ...I'd Iike to sing a very speciaI song for these very speciaI kids today. [PIANO PLAYING SOFT MELODY] [SINGING] There comes a time in everybody's life When your destiny is born And there's no doubt What you're all about Is there without a warning And when it comes You gotta take it And believe you're gonna make it through There's not a challenge you can't face There's not a rainbow you can't chase Dream big Reach high Don't ever be afraid Just spread your wings and fly With a heart full of faith A whole lot of luck And some love to see you through Dream big And itjust might come true Always know what the future holds Is in the hands of fate And don't forget That when times gets tough The gift is worth the wait But when it finally comes together Your star will shine forever more And you'll give hope to all the rest Show them how to be the best Matthew, Joseph.
