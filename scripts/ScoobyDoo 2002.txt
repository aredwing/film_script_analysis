Can you hear me? - Fredster here, Velms. Shockingly, Daphne's been captured again. That's okay. When the Luna Ghost rounds the corner with Daphne... ...Shaggy and Scooby will pop out of the barrel... You'll activate the conveyor belt, spilling the oil onto the floor. Just remember my plan. Like, chill out, Scooby-Doo. Stop shaking. Me? That's you. Right. It's me. Sorry. Scooby-Doo, what are you doing, man? Like, this is no time to... Oh, boy. Like, there's a ghost right behind me, isn't there? Run! Go, Shaggy! Go! - Run! - Like, I'm trying, buddy! Fred, now! Hurry up! - I got him. - Look out! Sorry! - Sorry, Velma. - I know, Fred. - Where's the ghost? - He's right behind us. Skateboard! Is he still after us, Scoob? Banzai! - Zoinks! Grab the hook! - Hold on, Shaggy! Daphne, are you okay? I'm so over this damsel-in-distress nonsense. Where's Shagster? - Like, I'm right here, man. - Me too. Scoob, that was fun. Let's grab another skateboard and do it again. Yeah. There you go. One for you. Good-looking guy. All right, nice to see you. - Thanks for saving the factory. - Pam, any comments? This is a victory for any celebrity who wants to make a quality action figure. - What's the secret of your success? - Teamwork. I do a tremendous amount of teamwork, and I always have a plan. Come on. Yeah, my plan. I knew from the start there was no phantom. The Luna Ghost is, in fact... - Old Man Smithers? - The creepy janitor? He wanted revenge after you refused to go out with him. How could you, Pam? I'm a lover-boy of George Clooney-an proportions. - Fred, how was the ghost able to fly? - I can answer that. Watch. These balloons fill with a highly potent helium synthesis... ...giving the Luna Ghost... ...his weightless appearance. I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids... ...and your dumb dog! I'll get you for this! Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Fred, I can't believe you took credit for my plan again. Some plan. That ghost pawed me for an hour and a half. It's not our fault you always get kidnapped. I don't always get kidnapped. Can't believe you'd say that. Oh, please. You come with your own ransom note. - My glasses! - Who's helpless now? I'm going to kill you, Daphne! Watch the ascot! You guys, look, I know I'm just the dude that carries the bags... ...but we all play an important part in this group. I mean, we're just like a big, delicious banana split. Fred, you're the big banana. Daphne, you're the pastrami and gum-flavored ice cream. And Velma... ...you're the sweet-and-sour mustard sauce that goes on top. That sounds pretty good, doesn't it? You know what, Shaggy? You've really put it in perspective for me. Thanks. I quit. - No. - No way. You can't quit. I was gonna quit in, like, two seconds. Now everyone will think I copied off the smart girl. Now, wait a minute. Maybe I quit. I do. Yeah, I quit. I'm out of here. Good riddance. Don't... No. Don't go. Come on, you guys, don't do this. Please don't go. Do I quit? No, Scoob... ...friends don't quit. It looks like it's just you and me for a while. What now, Shaggy? I guess we'll all just do what we do best, Scoob. This is primo. Man, talk about toasted. Man, the only thing I like better than an eggplant burger... ...is a chocolate-covered eggplant burger. With hot sauce. Yeah, just another beautiful day in paradise. I'm looking for a "Mr. Rogers" and a "Mr. Doo." The detectives? It's probably somebody looking for us to solve some scary mystery. Nobody home! Quick, Scoob-o, grab the food-o, let's scram-o. I'm looking for a "Mr. Rogers" and a "Mr. Doo." Let's go! I'm sorry, dude. I'd love to help you out. You look like a really nice guy. We're not detectives anymore. I've been sent by Mr. Emile Mondevarious to invite you... ...to his amusement park, Spooky Island. We don't go near places with "spooky," "haunted," or "creepy" in the name. - Or hydrocolonic. - Right, but that's for another reason. But he'd like you to solve a mystery. He'll pay you a fee of $10,000. It's just, materialism is not really our bag, man. - Free airfare. - No, thanks. - Room and board. - No, thanks. And all you can eat. All you can eat? Fred? Velma? Are you going this way? - How have you...? - Been? - Yes. - Great. I'm on the lecture circuit with my new book... - ...Fred on Fred: The Many Faces of Me. - Jinkies, that's impressive. And yourself? I've been working at NASA, developing hydropowered missile defense systems. But, more importantly... - ...I'm on a journey of self-discovery. - NASA? Charter service to Spooky Island will begin boarding momentarily. What do you mean I can't have seven carry-on bags? - That's so economy. - Crap. Oh, no. I'm not talking to you guys. - What are you doing here? - Isn't it obvious? We all received the same letter from one Emile Mondevarious... ...the reclusive owner of Spooky Island. It's not fair. I was gonna solve the mystery all by myself. - And when you get caught? - I'm a black belt now. I've transformed my body into a dangerous weapon. It's true. Far out. I guess we're, like, all going to Spooky Island, man. Where's Scooby? Hello. Sorry. They don't allow big dogs on the plane. You've got to be kidding. No one is stupid enough to believe that. Who's the ugly old broad? - Say hello to Grandma. - Aloha. Flight 3774 to Spooky Island, now boarding. I wouldn't have agreed to come if I knew. Wait, just think about it for one minute. Mystery Inc. reunites. We'll be a team again, just like the old days. So come on... ...let's do that thing where we all put our hands in, lift them up, and go: Only if Fred and Velma do it. People are watching, Shag. Yeah, Scoob, "roo-hoo." Come on, buddy. Now that is a beautiful work of art. Would you mind me taking a seat there next to...? To my grandma. That's my grandma. Hi, Grandma. Like, no. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Bless you. I'm sorry. My allergies. It's usually only dogs that do it. - Maybe I'd better move. - No, wait. It's probably just my grandma's perfume. Yeah, even I sometimes get a little allergic, you know. Oh, jeez. I'm pretty sure Grandma wants to go back and visit with her pal Velma. Right, Grandma? Okay. Boy, oh, boy, those sure do look like Scooby Snacks. I know they're for dogs... ...but they're 100%% vegetarian, and I love them. Like, me too. Far out. I've never met another person who loves Scooby Snacks. - Me neither. - I'm Mary Jane. - Like, that's my favorite name. - Really? No way. Hello. Grandma? Velma, it's simple behavior modification. To cause a dog to discontinue any action, flick it on the nose. Observe. Scoob? See? Sit, Grandma! Bad, Grandma! Don't eat the kitty! Welcome to Spooky Island... ...the frightfully popular spring break spot for college students. Catch our Electrical Torture Parade. It's a Dead World After All. And the world famous Splatterhorn. Scooby-Doo! And the rest of Mystery Inc. It's marvelous to see you! How fanta... I'm sorry. That's the second time this week. Thank goodness. It's a new toy. I'm just getting up to speed with it. - Welcome. - Thank goodness. I was afraid I'd have to lug those to the hotel. That's what Spooky Island's about, realizing your worst fears. I'm Emile Mondevarious, the owner of this amusement park. - You seem less... - Spooky. ...than we'd have guessed. I can be pretty spooky when called upon. I can go: Claws and everything. You wouldn't want to run into me in a dark alley. - So you're the one who brought us here? - No. What brought you here was your insatiable appetite... ...for a juicy mystery. The truth is, Mystery Inc. is broken up. That's the beauty of something broken. It can be fixed. Therein lies its potential. And I need you to fix Spooky Island. What's the problem? I believe somebody's casting a spell on the students. Now listen and look around. Notice any difference between those arriving and those departing? They look like sober, well-behaved college kids. Precisely. They didn't before they came. They've changed. In other words, a magic spell. Carol! Carol, how was the island? Are you tricking on me? It's me, Brad. We've known each other since we were 3. Back off my grill, son! Carol, what are you doing? I'm terrified. The young people that come off that barge... ...the people I love the most, they're in danger. - I'm going to solve this one first. - Not before I solve it first. You'll look like total idiots when you're captured and I save you. Thank you. Marvelous. Maybe we can celebrate later by having a little spookapalooza. Spookapalooza? You haven't noticed anything unusual since you started working here? - Any weirdoes running around? - No. Welcome, dear victims. My name is N' Goo Tuana. This is my evil best pal, Zarkos. You may recognize him from Telemundo as the famous masked wrestler... ...Zarkos. This enchanted island... ...is a thoroughfare to the supernatural realm. For centuries, it was home to creatures who lived on the island undisturbed. But then... ...ten years ago... ...Emile Mondevarious... ...antagonized these ancient beings by building a theme park here. The creatures are furious, my friends. And I assure you... ...while you party... ...they plot... ...their revenge! Do my friends frighten you? They would, if it weren't for the holographic projectors... ...there, and there and there. What a smart little one. Hello, Dead Mike's. We got a "Mr. Doo" here? I got a call for a "Mr. Doo." Melvin Doo? No, Scooby. - Hello? - Got a bag... ...of hamburgers here for you. Just walk into the dark, shadowy part of the forest... ...where no one can see you. Okay. - Want a stuffed thingy? - Nobody can win those. Fred says it's a worthless talent, that I should've learned French instead. I say you don't need to know what " Voulez-vous coucher avec moi" means... ...to love that song. I think being good at crane machine is way cooler than French. Voil. Nobody's ever given me a stuffed dismembered head before. Excuse me. Now I have to start my voodoo ritual all over again! Voodoo ritual? - I was about to sacrifice this chicken. - That chicken's not alive. I know. What, did you figure that out when you saw it didn't have a head? What do you want? Why you in the voodoo ritual space? I'm looking for clues as to who's behind the students' strange behavior. Here's a clue: Purple is a fall color. - It's the middle of May! - Pardon? Do yourself a favor and get off this island. Go home. Go home before evil befalls your skinny, aerobicized booty. And whatever you do... ...do not, I repeat... ...do not go into that Spooky Island castle. - You want me to go to that castle. - Didn't you hear what I said? You knew I'd do the opposite of what you said. You told me not to go to the castle so I would go... ...where you set a trap to capture me. Unless... ...you knew I'd figure it out, so you told me not to go... ...so I'd think you wanted me to go, so I wouldn't go. I'll find out what you're hiding in that castle. You watch. What in the world? Hamburgers, where are you? Hamburgers. Thank you. Shaggy! It's been really nice. Shaggy! Monster! Monster! A monster? Scooby-Doo, quit goofing around, man. I guess I should go. Bye, Scooby. Bless you. Shaggy. Scooby. No way. - Scoob and me don't do castles. - Why not? They have paintings that watch you, suits of armor you think is a statue... ...but there's a guy inside who follows you every time you turn around. - How many times did that happen? - Twelve. We're not gonna do it. That's right. Scooby? Did you hurt your paw? - Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? - Oh, boy! - And you'll be fearless? - Fearless? Hong Kong Phooey, watch the fists of fury. Here you go. Thank you. There's plenty more where that came from. Let's go before someone sees. You're not gonna stay out here alone, are you? No, thank you. Oh, boy. This place is, like, uber creepy. Yeah, uber creepy. The only thing missing is a mindless zombie. Fred, get back. I found this place. I call dibs on its clues. - I've already found some clues. - What? I followed some weird footprints here. It might be dangerous for you. If anyone messes with me, I'll open a can of Chinese whoop-ass on them. - What are you doing here? - This ride was closed for construction. It's the most likely place to hatch a plan. And I wanted to scare Daphne. Since we're all together, let's split up and look for more clues. - Daphne, you and I... - Typical. - What? - Nothing. - I was always picked last for the teams. - Okay. Daphne, exit through the entrance. Velma and I will enter through the exit. And Shaggy and Scooby... ...do whatever you guys do. Look at this, huh, Scoob? It's like a medieval Sizzler. Pinch me, I'm in heaven... - It's an expression, Scoob. - Sorry. Velma, I never meant to... Well, you know... - ...pick you last. - Don't worry about it. I know you. All you care about are swimsuit models. Look, I'm a man of substance. Dorky chicks like you turn me on too. That's a compliment. Yes! Yes! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, no! And now for our dinner show. What? Watch out! - I got a bad feeling about this. - Me too. And now for the main course: You! Feast on this. Jinkies. They're moving toward us. Run! - We're trapped. - Quick, try the bookcase. - One of these has to open a passageway. - Velma, this is a ride. You got a better plan? What do we do? Do what we do best, Scoob: Eat. It's plastic. So what? You drink out of a toilet. So do you. I'm not helpless. I am helpless. I'm gonna die! We made it, Scoob. We're alive! That was weird. Fred? Are you all right? The last book. I don't feel so good. Reminds me of the time we tried to eat that guy in the hot-dog costume. Looks like some kind of school. In a spooky castle ride? Fishy. Welcome to America. I am using the language English. - Shaggy, look. - Let's check it out. Oh, boy. Lights, camera, action, huh, Scoob? Now that you're a young adult... ...you'll need to learn societal dos... ...and don'ts. Interaction between young people is polite and casual. Hey, sorry, bro. I will crush your bones into dust. Let's see how the situation should be handled. Remember, today's young people have a language all their own. Sorry, bro. No big whoop, dog. Catch that new vid on the box? True dat. I'm up to sniznuff on all popular trends. Word. It seems to be a brainwashing facility of some type. Wherever there's a brainwashing cult, there's always a power-hungry leader. - The Papa Smurf figure. - Mondevarious. Then why would he have invited us here? Jellybeans. I'll have whatever he's having. Are you challenging me? Maybe. Pull my finger. Too late. - You're in trouble. - Oh, boy. I'm not stopping till your fur is singed off. We're here to solve a mystery. Yeah, Scoob. Let's get out of here. Zoinks! Skedaddle! - I found a neat and scary clue. - Us too. This is a brainwashing facility for an evil cult. Maybe this is the secret relic thingy they worship. We'll all be relics if we don't get out of here. I got a plan. What's that smell? Sir, they found the Daemon Ritus. For your sake, they better not have gone far. It is time to summon the big muchachos. Like, oh, no! Mystery Inc. You all seem rather cheery. Good news, I hope? Mr. Mononucleosis... - Yes? - We have hit a clue smorgasbord. We have three suspects as to who's behind this evil hooty. N' Goo Tuana. He believes your park's on enchanted ground. The voodoo man, who tricked me into going to the castle. - And you. - Me? Let's split up. We'll meet in a half-hour. I'll interview employees to see if they've noticed anything odd. I'll translate these inscriptions Daphne found. I'll go research cults on the Net. I'm a suspect? Don't take it personally. It's because you creep me out. I see. Fine. Jinkies. Hey. Your friends ditch you? No, I always did the brainwork. What's this? I believe it's called the Daemon Ritus. Daemon Ritus? What's it for? This describes an old race of creatures. It's reminiscent of Pandaemonous texts, so I can make some of it out. It looks like instructions to some sort of secret ritual. It is fascinating. On the house. Nice sweater. You really dig doing this, huh? Like, clues and stuff. Certainly. Really focusing on a mystery reminds me of the old days. We were quite a crew back then. That was the best time of my life. Shaggy and Scooby... What goofballs! Kind of like they are today. And Daphne... So beautiful. She was the coolest girl at Coolsville High. Fred. He was so handsome. And he really knew how to accessorize. Sounds perfect. Yeah, but every family has one nut. Scrappy-Dappy-Doo! Ghosts don't stand a chance with me. Let me at 'em. I'll rack 'em. I'll sock 'em. For the thousandth time, there's no such thing as ghosts. Sure there are. When I find them, I'll give them a dose of puppy power! Oh, God. He's peeing on me. That little egomaniac had flipped his lid. Scrappy, I told you, no urinating on Daphne. - It was an accident. - You were marking your territory. You don't have the scrote for this job. Listen up, losers. The time has come to appoint me your unquestioned leader. Either that, or I'm out of here. What's the idea? You can't do this to me. People adore me. I'm as cute as a Powerpuff Girl. I'll get my own show. Puppy power, huh? And he wasn't even a puppy. He had a gland disorder. Help me! Help me! Monsters! Monsters! This is the most embarrassing thing you've done... ...since you cleaned your beans at Don Knotts' Christmas party. How many times do I have to tell you? There are no such things as ghouls, ghosts, goblins or monsters. Now listen up. There is absolutely... ...absolutely no such thing as... Monster! Fred! Scooby... Save Daphne. My glasses. I can't find my glasses. Help me find my glasses. Here they are. Thank you. Nice mask. Bad breath. Here. Jinkies. Velma! Come on! Velma! This is, like, the opposite of what I wanted to do today. Leave it! Stand back, sir. I'll protect you. Mr. Mondevarious! Daphne, go! Scooby-Doo, where are you? Running suitcase. Run suitcase. Run... Thank you. - Where's Scooby? - I hope he's okay. - Right here. Scooby-Dooby-Doo! - Hey, Scoob. I have a sinking feeling these dudes aren't brainwashed cult members. What do they want with the students? We need to follow them. - Say what? - Defeat them and save Fred and Velma. Sort of like my plan: Get out of here, let the creatures eat Fred and Velma. No way. Fred and Velma always figured out everything. Now it's our turn. For the first time, they're the damsels in distress, not me. - Help? - Timber. - Okay, I'm calling for help. - No. I got this. I got this. I don't got this. - Coast Guard, Fitzgibbon. - Hello, sir. We're on Spooky Island. Our friends were... ...kidnapped. We need someone here right away. We do have a unit in the vicinity. Can you meet them at the pier? All right, they'll be right there. "Our friends have been kidnapped." - Something messed up is happening. - Is the Coast Guard here? What happened to the shattered windows and busted walls? Yo, Red. The ball. Let's go. Anyone else think this is strange? - Okay, we need to split up. - Why? - We need to find Fred and Velma. - I'll go this way. And we'll go with you. Come on, Scoob. Fred? Yo, the bitch was like, "What?" And I was like, "Later on!" What up, dog? And... - ...dog. - Keeping it real. - What happened last night? - We got beats like it was the lizz-nizz. - You know what I'm saying, G? - No. You hear that? Get the dog. - Damsel in distress. - Let go of me. Help! Hurry, get the door! - Why is Fred in a bad mood? - He's not in a bad mood, Scoob... ...he's a monster. - Shaggy, bikes! - I know, "yikes!" No, bikes! Scoob! Shaggy, look out! I just saw my friend Beth Ann. Something's wrong with her eyes. Like, hop on! Like, what a drag! Like, duck! - Yes! - That was great! - Are you all right? You were great. - You too. - Scooby, what are you doing, man? - Mary Jane is a man in a mask. - Mary Jane is a man in a mask? - Scooby. What are you doing, man? Step off, Scoob. Shaggy, you're whipped. I'm whipped? Yeah? Why don't you say that to my face? Okay, I will. Your mommy eats cat poop! No, Scooby-Doo, your mom eats cat poop! Bring it. You want a piece of the Shagster? - Feel the pain, Scoob. - Okay. Come on! Two shots! Two shots! Me and you, me and you again. I'll give you some right now, buddy. Scoob! I gotta save him. You stay here, I'll be right back. No, Shaggy. I mean, it's too dangerous. I've got to. He's, like, my best pal. Friends don't quit. Scoob? Scooby-Doo... ...where are you? Scoob? Shaggy. Shaggy. Shaggy! Velma. I'll save you. Thanks, Shaggy. Boy, am I glad to see you. Let me go so I can return to my body. Get out of here... ...before they steal your protoplasm too. I always knew you were a hero, Shaggy. Jinkies! - Hey, buddy. - Shaggy! Someone must have spiked my root beer last night. Talk me down, man. Fred, you're a frigging protoplasmic head. I know. But I'm still the best-looking protoplasmic head here. How do you drive this? The Darkopalypse's upon us. Get what you need for the ceremony. On your right. Your left. I'm coming, good-looking! - Thank you, you've saved me. - Sorry, I'm looking for my friends. But... Put me back, Shaggy. I'll figure a way out myself. - Like, how? - I don't know. I'll use my tongue as an oar and swim to the edge. Sorry. Yo, yo, you, yo. What the...? You could use a little sunlight. That's one part of the mystery solved. The creatures need our bodies to survive in sunlight. Like a human suit. SPF 1,000,000. But what are they doing here in the first place? Daphne, you okay? Yeah. - But I'm not Daphne! - Fred? I couldn't get to my body. I didn't know where else to go. It's not easy to steer when you're pure spirit. I can look at myself naked. Oh, brother. - Get your hands off me. - Daphne? - He planned this somehow, didn't he? - Hey, good-looking. Fred, you egocentric... - Please tell me you guys are you. - Fred keeps touching me. Makes you nostalgic for the homicidal creatures. I stole this. I hope it helps. The Daemon Ritus. - I'm me again. - Yippee for you. Man, like, why am I wearing a dress? Everyone remain calm. Velma, what the heck's going on? If I am correct... ...due to the instability of protoplasm in the proximity of the Daemon Ritus... ...we're going to continue randomly changing bodies until... Jinkies! ...until the protoplasm realigns with the correct bodies. I'm Fred again! Daph, what's wrong with you? Don't you ever eat? I'm me. - I'm back. - Like, me too. Told you so. - Oh, no. - Let's go. I guess that was the wrong ingredient. Wait. I know how to handle this guy. Hey, you! What're you doing? Yes. That is masterful. I'm doing a voodoo ritual. I need to get the right ingredients. The only way to protect myself is by blessing this dead Arnouki beast. They're about to perform their evil Darkopalypse ritual. - Darkopalypse ritual? - Right. - That's what the ancient text describes. - Don't open that! They use the protoplasm in the vat as an energy source. And the leader needs to absorb a purely good soul to complete the ritual. Legend has it, once the ritual is performed... ...the creatures will rule on Earth for 10,000 years. That's why I have this in my house. To protect myself. You have another one of those? Those creatures are taking over the world? That is so mean. They can't do the ritual without a pure human soul. Where will they get one? I didn't say human. Oh, boy. Hello, puppy. If the person behind all this needs Scooby-Doo... Then that person is the one who brought Scooby here. Scoobert. How are you, my friend? Sit down, please. Okay. Scooby Snack? Maybe one. We'll need some more of those. That's me! It certainly is. And that's because... why? We love you, Scooby-Doo. Unlike that alleged friend of yours, Shaggy. He wouldn't believe you about that nasty girl Mary Jane, would he? No. But I believe you, my friend. And that's why I've got a very important job for you. What's that? That's a cat with a bobbing head. Please don't touch it. I would like you... ...to be a sacrifice. A sacrifice? If Mondorajagaga wanted Scooby, why'd he invite the rest of us? It doesn't matter. We gotta, like, go save Scoob. Our area of expertise is nut jobs in Halloween costumes. We're supposed to be heroes, man. So I'm gonna do what I always do: I'm gonna eat myself a Scooby Snack, and I'm gonna save my best pal. Velmster? You think I'm gonna fall for that? Giving me my own nickname? Trying to make me feel like... ...part of the gang? We could make a plan. What can I do? The only thing I'm good for is getting caught. But you never let that stop you before. And if that's not a true hero, then I don't know what is. Let's get jinkie with it. Okay, so we use the pulleys to tip over the vat. Daphne will open the air vents and release the disco skull. The light will refract off the skull... The creatures will explode, I'll find Scoob, and we'll have saved the world. Oh, no. The ritual's beginning. Quick. Attach this to the vat. We're here to save you. Shaggy, faster. All systems go. Wait, no! Mystery Inc. rides again. Quick, hide the Daemon Ritus. Would you like another Scooby Snack? Okay. Scooby-Doo! Yo, yo, yo. Yo, homedogs. You forgot the next part of the dance... ...where we do the Electric Slide, you know... Hurry up, Velma. Welcome to my little end-of-the-world party. I've waited a long time for this moment. Thank you for returning the ultimate party favor: The Daemon Ritus. And now, behold the sacrifice. Thank you. Thank you. Hello, thank you. Thank you. Shaggy? Let's run for it. We gotta get out of here. - I'm a sacrifice. Hello. - A sacrifice? Dude, that's not a good thing, Scoob. I'm sorry I yelled at you. And I'm sorry I haven't been a very good friend since we got here. - But you gotta trust me now. - You don't trust me. I do trust you. Now, look. Who's your best buddy? - Shaggy. - Right. And who's my best buddy? - Scooby-Doo? - That's right. You are. And we're like two trippy peas in a far-out pod, man. Best buddies trust each other. Let's do what we do best. Let's run out of here screaming in fear like two lunatics, okay? On the count of... Let's make it five. One. Two. Hey, look at me! The moment is at hand. Through the Daemon Ritus, I shall absorb the energy source. And now, to complete the transformation... ...I shall absorb the pure one. Ultimate power shall be mine! Nobody absorbs my pal! Come on! I'm free! Look at me! Get him! Let's get the Daemon Ritus. Get off my pincer! Cowabunga! Look, Velms. A man in a mask. We love you, Scooby-Doo. We love you. That alleged friend of yours, Shaggy. I shall absorb... Puppy power! I've outsmarted... Scrappy-Doo. Correction. The new, improved Scrappy. Because I, Scrappy-Dappy-Doo, have absorbed enough energy... ...to rule the world with my all-powerful army! And I've brought you here, puny, pathetic Mystery Inc... ...to witness my moment of triumph. All I need to complete my transformation is Scooby-Doo. Me? Don't you mean Melvin Doo? Seize them! Like, let's get out of here! Take that, pretty boy! This is totally un-groovy, Scoob. Scooby-Doo, where are you? Yield to my puppy power! - We gotta tip over the protoplasm vat. - How? The pincer. Come on. You all need to step back, because Fredster's got his groove on. Got you! You look so much bigger on TV. You're done! Come back here, you lazy beatnik. - Crud. - Told you so. Like, wow! Give me the dog! Down! Sit! Bad Scrappy! Let's finish this puppy! Now! Not again. Captured again, seorita? Not this time! - Now who's the damsel in distress? - Me? Straight up. Mystery Inc., this ain't over! Not by a long shot! I'll rock you and sock you... ...and crush you like... - Like, dude? - What? You're a bad puppy! Come on, I can still take you.
