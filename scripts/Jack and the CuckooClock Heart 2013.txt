And a fledgling in this cage here. He's in good hands now. A warm drink? Tea, coffee, whisky? You must eat. I made pancakes. The best you'll ever taste. You can't give birth on an empty stomach. Feels very solid here. - He has ice for a heart. - A nice heart? No, ice. Cubes, not cream. This will do the trick. It'll give you good heart. It goes with your scrawny head and big feet. Mint chocolate would improve the taste. William, the window! Listen to me, my boy... If you don't want to freeze up again, you must obey 3 rules. # Firstly, never touch # # The hands of your heart # # Rule number two # # Keep your temper under control # # Last but not least # # The most important rule # # Whatever else you do # # Never fall in love # # 'Cause then forever more # # If your heart goes in a spin # # The big hand at your core # # Will pop out of your skin # # Your bones will implode # # Your cogs and springs explode # # And your cuckoo-clock heart # # Grind to a halt for good # No, little ice cube, I'm not your mother, even if I wish I were. He looks like a snowflake with clock hands sticking out. That way, you won't lose him in a snowstorm. I'm sure she'll make a much better mother than me. Ow. Here we go! The basement of the mountain is mine! The great escape in the sky catacombs! Not today, pumpkin, I'm very busy just now. Arthur went out in the rain and he rusted up. It's my birthday. You promised! Teeth brushed? Clock wound up? Clock brushed, teeth wound up. Like every morning for 10 years! I'll see to Anna and Luna and take you. You have my word. It's the same every year. Work first, me second. Anna and Luna have been playing storks again. Who saw storks? Sit with Arthur while the oil soaks in. And spare me your stuffed bird face. C'mon, life heals every wound. You'll get over it, in time. Take me, my boss gave me the boot. When I told my wife, she kicked me out, too. Why do you carry eggs? Because they're full of memories. My wife cooked great eggs. - You learned her technique? - No. But when I boil eggs, I feel like I'm with her again. Take one. As a birthday present. I'll be taking your memories. Don't worry. I have more than I need. One day, you'll be glad to find a childhood memory in your bag. Thanks! Christopher Columbus! Ready to explore? I'll just change and we'll go! Hold your horses. You don't need to change before we go, but I have something important to say. I wanted your heart to consolidate before unleashing you. Every heartbeat is a minor miracle. - It's fragile. - I know. There are 3 rules you must never forget. Don't touch my hands, I know! Yes, and keep your temper under control. The third, which I never told you, is the most important. You must never, never ever, fall in love. - That's why we never went to town. - Finished? You'd die in a heartbeat, felled by the emotional shock of love. I know, I have a toy heart nobody can play with. It's no joke. How can I fall in love? I don't even know what love is. Look! Not so fast! Look! Jack, calm down. Is that my dad? No, not your father. Wait! A cloud I could eat! You mean me? The thing you're nibbling. What's that... - What's that music? - A barrel organ. Pretty, isn't it? It functions much like your heart. That must be why you like it. It's mechanical with emotions inside. I apologize for importuning you, but would you have the time? Six o'clock, sir. And one minute! I knew it. She won't come now. You poor thing. Here, I have a hankie for you. May I? You know men cry better than women? It's true. With tears twice as big. Jack? Jack! # My vision's not quite right # # But glasses make me look a sight # # Enough to give the world a fright # # Like a sprite # # Wearing specs # # Oh, sparky little pet # # It's dangerous to be coquette # # Don't refuse to wear your specs # # If it leaves you in the dark # # I prefer life all a blur # # I forget to wear my glasses # # When I sing and share caresses # # It feels good to close my eyes # # Oh, my pretty arsonist # # Let me clasp you close to me # # Rip your clothes with my teeth # # And tear them into confetti # # To scatter as we kiss... # Confetti? # On you and me # # All I see are stars # # Suddenly some days # # My eyes lead me astray # # Far away down the street # # Then I can't bear to steal # # A glance at the sun # # Or dare to look the sky # # Straight in the eye # # All I see are stars # # I won't let you stray # # I'll be your only guide # # Let me be your pair of eyes # # You'll be my special flame # # There's one thing I must confess # # Of all five senses my hearing's best # # I'll never recognize you by relying on my eyes # # Smoldering embers alone in the dark # # We'll raise cascades of sparks # # When the clock of my heart # # Strikes midnight we'll catch on fire # # And blaze so bright you see the light # # All I see are stars # # Suddenly some days # # My eyes lead me astray # # Far away down the street # # Then I can't bear to steal # # A glance at the sun # # Or dare to look the sky # # Straight in the eye # # All I see are stars # You often sprout Italian ice creams? Only if I eat spaghetti after midnight. What's that pitter-patter? It's rain. Do you like it? Rain, no. The sound it makes, yes. What's that? A thunder storm? No, magnetic. Jack! Anything but that! What did you do to him? You could have died! Have you forgotten the 3rd rule? No. Your cogs hurt when you cough? It's pitiful suffering compared to the pain of love. The more you love, the more intense the pain. You experience an ache, the torment of jealousy and incomprehension, then the agony of rejection and injustice. Your heart's mechanism will explode. I transplanted it, I know its precise limits. One kiss, however light, could destroy you. Just like that... Six feet under! Love is dangerous for your tiny heart. Know why I saved you? You're the child I never had. How come? My hard luck. Nature plays dirty tricks on us. You should know that. I shed a lot of tears, but I came to terms with it. One day, you arrived, heaven sent. A kind of consolation prize. The idea of losing you makes me insanely sad. You see? That's when you started drinking tear liqueur? Among other things. How are you? We never got to wish you happy birthday. You were so captivated by the basement of the mountain! Well? How was your journey to the center of town? I have work to do downstairs. Well? It was fabulous! What was so fabulous? A little singer who won't wear her glasses. What's that? She's mesmerizing. Like a bird perched on high heels. She has something so fragile yet intense. Like kindling. When she sings, it's like birdsong with words. And her nose! A work of art! So pert I wonder if it works or if it's only for decoration. It's too tiny to hold her glasses. With a cold, she snores like a locomotive! No, a nose like that only sounds like a flute. You're sure you haven't caught a bug? You have! It's against the rules. Against the rules! I know. For your own good. If only I could live without love! Take it from us. I fall in love with every patient who comes here. And it never lasts with any of them. Like the flowers? I chose them myself! Took them off a grave, you mean. Of a very rich and much beloved man. Drowning in flowers. We just tidied it up, so people can see the tombstone. The poor man's name was hidden. Poor man. That reminds me, I have a surprise for you. You do? Thank you! A new dress, Luna? You don't like it? She found it next to the flowers. It's a teenage throwback. I just remodeled it a touch. It was our school uniform at Calton Hill. School? I was a real Goody-Two-Shoes. Madeleine, I was thinking about the 3 rules... - That's wonderful. - Isn't it? - I found the solution. - What solution? I need to go to school. To learn and understand the rules, and apply them in real life. How about you start by studying the slate? If I want to work properly, I have to go to school. School! You'll be bored stiff. No, I won't. You will so. You won't get to choose what you read, unlike here. You'll have to sit still for hours. You won't be allowed to make any noise. Even dreaming's only allowed at recess. Knowing you, you'll hate it. And they'll all make fun of your clock. As if you were a monster. All children go to school. You're always working and I get lonely. I need to discover the world now. Discover the world? At school? There's a satchel in the attic. Bring it down. That's the best birthday present I could wish for. Hello. Do you know a tiny, short-sighted singer? Hi, have you seen a singer... For a few years now this place has felt like home. It's not only the schoolyard that I've made my own. All the other pupils respect and fear me. If they didn't, they know they'd pay for it dearly. I don't like change. For me life's about stability. I crush anyone who challenges my authority. I always do what needs doing to be the undisputed king. But a new lad just started and he wants to muscle in. Looking for something? Yes, a singer. In miniature. What do you want with her? I saw her bumping into things, so I wanted to buy her a pair of glasses. Her name's... Her name is Miss Acacia. Miss Acacia. Nobody's allowed even to speak her name, except me! Nobody! You hear me, pipsqueak? Forget about her. What's that ticking? Is that your heart racing? Yes. You're in love with her, as well? A bit. Your tough luck. She's gone. She fled the country. Don't let me hear you think about her. I'll smash your ticker. Got that? I'll crush you, so you can never fall in love again. # Hail to you, my feline friend # # On the rooftops every night # # With the moon as your bedside light. # Well? What was school like? Did a satchel-clad imp dodge giving me a kiss? Next time, I'll crack your heart open on your skull. Come and see Big Ben! Come and grind his gears. Go ahead, take it in turns. # Everywhere I go # # There's a door called Joe. # # I have to find the key # # And at least set me free... # It belonged to a good friend. He died in the saddle, going giddy up, giddy up! Ride 'em, cowboy! Libido killed the rodeo star! That's enough! Let's have some fun. 14 years old! Party time! Back home, you'd be considered an adult! Arthur, Anna, Madeleine... Fiesta! Come on, let your hair down! # Happy birthday # # To you # # Happy birthday # # To you # # Happy birthday # # Happy birthday to you, Joe # # Happy birthday # # To you. # Happy birthday, Joe. Give me that card. Now! It's my birthday. It's for me. Signed Miss Acacia. It's for me. It's my birthday! You're running slow, Big Ben! Ah! Ah! Did school go well today? No. What happened? You saw that singer! - I killed Joe! - What? I killed his eye with the cuckoo. Madeleine, policemen coming up the hill. To arrest me because of Joe's eye! Take Jack and put him on the first train out. Leave it to us. I'll handle the police. I'll pack a bag and you'll go out back. What'll you tell them? That you never came home, then that you're missing. In time, you'll be declared dead. Arthur will help me dig a grave. With what in the coffin? No coffin. An epitaph on the tree. The police won't check. The advantage of being a "witch. " They don't open my tombs. Take care of your key. As soon as you settle down, consult a clockmaker. - Don't you mean doctor? - Definitely not. Don't let a doctor near your heart, only a qualified clockmaker. Not so hard, you'll damage your clock. You have to leave now. I'd die if they caught you. Come on, let's go. I haven't even left yet and I feel so cold. # As the train departs, I'm falling apart # # Like a clock tower left to rot # # In a desert of blue smoke # # I start my trip going lickety spit # # Prey to a fear that grips # # All the while scared to bits # # I'll learn to control the shakes # # But for now my heart rattles like a snake # # In a tin can # # Panic's causing frantic antics in my heart # # Loco locomotive # # Loco locomotive, steam away # # Watch out for me without you I'll have nowhere to go # # My heart's on the blink so heavy it just sinks # # I'm teetering on the brink # # It tosses and turns and skips a beat a shipwrecked heart # # Is no good for love # # Roll in the fog # # Rattle your ghost trains # # The time is right to conjure up for you # # Specters of sublime women # # Blondes or brunettes rolling the dice in the night # # I'll slice 'em up before they take fright # # Compliments of your humble servant Jack the Ripper # # Have no fear, my boy # # You'll soon learn to scare # # To prove you exist # # Have no fear, my boy # # You'll learn to send shivers down spines # # Panic's causing frantic antics in my heart # # Loco locomotive # # Loco locomotive, steam away # # Panic's causing frantic antics in my heart # # Loco locomotive # # Loco locomotive, steam away. # Damn thing refuses to work! Apologies for the intrusion, but I'm anxious to play with my invention, and it keeps breaking down on me for no reason, see? Yes, I think I see. What do we have here? Superb volcanic mechanics, mon ami. I need to find a clockmaker. Do you know one? I'm no clockmaker, but I'm a handy fellow. I'd enjoy tinkering with that. Would you care to pay a visit to my workshop in Paris to put you back in working order? Extraordinaire! Your Dr. Madeleine is a genius! The way it's pieced together is... It's a labor of love. Down to the tiniest detail. Trouble is, love is dangerous for me, according to Madeleine. - Is it badly damaged? - No, it works fine. That's an idea for my camera! If I use a spring identical to the one I used in the barrel of your arteries, this dream maker should crank back into life. Just like yours, my friend. Mister... Call me Georges. Georges Mlis. Mr. Mlis, I met a little singer. These things happen. When I first saw her, I felt an earthquake in my clock. My gears creaked, my tick-tock raced. I gasped for breath, hands whizzing, head spinning... Did you like it? I loved it! Well then? I became scared Madeleine was right, that love would kill me. Fear of being hurt increases the chances of being hurt. Do you think a tightrope-walker stops to think about falling off? No, they savor the thrill of braving danger! If you wrap yourself in cotton wool, you'll die of boredom. You want to embark on adventures with this girl? If I can find her. She may be in Grenada. Nothing's more thrilling than recklessness! When you're 14 and chasing a girl across Europe, you must have highly developed reckless genes, right? Look! It works! It functions like your heart. A device that absorbs emotions! I could make a film about your cuckoo-clock heart now. That sounds fun. You know, when I was in love, I kept inventing new gadgets. Gadgets and more gadgets, all to amuse my fiance. I think she was sick of my gadgets in the end. One day, I chopped up two of her shelves and put them on wheels from an old hospital cart, for us to go gliding in the moonlight. She refused to get on and made me repair the shelves. Love isn't easy every day, my boy. Come with me to Andalusia. Anything's possible there! A conjuror on the verge of a nervous breakdown on your pilgrimage to love? I'd love having a magician along! I'm your man. Let me throw some tricks in my bag and away we go! Andalusia. Andalusia. Andalusia! Andalusia. Anda. Anda. Andalusia. Anda. Anda. Andalusia. Anda. Anda. Andalusia! Anda. Andalusia! # I'm a human illusion # # Who wants to be a man # # No mechanics, no tricks # # The gimmick of my dreams # # Would be to be seen as a man # # A grown man, a human being # Andalusia! Anda! # Who needs no tricks # # A human not a freak # # No mechanics, no tricks # # The gimmick of my dreams # # Would be to be seen as a man # # A grown man, a human being. # Andalusia. I do believe we've arrived. What do you think? Ah! Makes a change from Edinburgh. My head's spinning! Oh, extraordinary. Roll up! A man laying eggs, two monsters in love, three sobbing specters at the Circo Bizzarro! A man is turned into a bird at the Ghost Train... Ah! Looking for work, shrimp? I need a Frightener. No, I'm looking for a tiny flamenco singer. Here? A speck of dust in a sandstorm! She has rinky-dink ankles and knocks into things. Knock it off! Do you want the job or not? The chica chocolate herself! It's said she catches fire to light up starless nights. Coming up at the bandstand, the flamenco picante of Miss Acacia! Miss Acacia? Make your mind up! I'll think it over. Mr. Mlis! Mr. Mlis! Put your best poker face on, never show any fear or doubts. You have an ace up your sleeve. It's a Heart. Don't play the Jack. Act the King and you'll win the Queen. I'm no good at cards. You're different and you think it's a weakness. The reverse is true. Difference is your strength. Your fragility, your clock-heart, makes you special and so attractive. Accept your difference. My handicap as a weapon of seduction? Seriously? Sure! Didn't you fall for your little singer because she kept bumping into things? Maybe so. Shh. It's open. The coast is clear. Charge! Madeleine: One kiss, however light, could destroy you. Just like that... Six feet under! # My vision's not quite right # # But glasses make me look a sight # # Enough to give the world a fright # # Like a sprite... # Who let you in? The ultimate seduction is giving the illusion of not trying to seduce her. Hey. Hello. I leaned against your door and landed on your couch. You often crash in on girls about to change? No, not often. Where else do you land? In the bed or the shower? I'm sorry. Haven't we met? You look familiar. Familiar? What do you want? I have something for you. What is it? A bouquet of glasses. I prefer flowers. I don't wear glasses. They make me look like a fly. Fine by me. Can we see each other again, glasses or no? Perhaps. - You're not from here, are you? - I am. I work on the Ghost Train. Great, so you're the new Frightener? Exactly! The new Frying-Tonightener is me. Can I see you in action? Sure. Where? The Ghost Train. Of course! Tomorrow? 4 o'clock? Perfect. How did it go? Yes, how? Great! She said "perhaps. " Georges, would you care to stay for a cup of coffee? - Or tea? - Both. The job's still open? You always run to think things over? Yes, I gave it lots of thought. I'd really like the job. How do you frighten people? It won't make us millionaires. At least, you'll make the trains run on time. Count on it. Know your place, scare people and we're good. - Yes, ma'am. - Miss! Hello! You gave me a fright. I have a sensitive heart. Me too. # When I went on the Ghost Train # # I met this old girl called Brigitte Heim # # I'm the boss of the Ghost Train # # I used to steal skulls from the graves # # To make nice decorations # # In the Ghost Train # # She was a soul on the Ghost Train # # She wants me to frighten people # # Little me # # If you walk on skulls # # And break something # # You pay # # I was the king of the Ghost Train # # 'Cause other people want to see my heart bleeding # # I was the king of the Ghost Train # # Until the day when the little fire girl # # Comes to see me # # I don't care about scary woman # # And all her houses full of emptiness # # Oh, I don't care about scary woman # # And all her houses full of emptiness # # 'Cause the little fire girl of my dreams # # Is sleeping in my arms now # # Arms now # # Arms now # # Arms now... # # I'm the king of the Ghost Train... # # You're in love with your own skull # # It's a nice decoration # # For the Ghost Train # # If you give me a headache # # You'll pay # # If you don't scare people # # You'll pay # # Pay, pay, pay, they always pay # # Pay, pay, pay, they always pay # # Pay, pay, pay, they always pay # # There's ghosts, goblins, red smoke. # Nobody was frightened. You were pathetic. I have a reputation to maintain. He was scary. I was petrified. Of course. She can't see beyond her nose. You were great. I couldn't see a thing, but it seemed a lot of fun. Congrats! Thanks. Did you try the glasses? They're all twisted or broken. Yes, so you won't be scared of breaking them. I have a strange feeling, as if we'd already lived, or at least dreamed, what's happening. I really feel like I know you. Could we dance? Here, in silence? That way, we stay in rhythm. Alright. What's that pitter-patter? It's rain. Do you like it? Rain, no. The sound it makes, yes. I heard it somewhere before. - That's my heart. - What? My heart. I was given it the day I was born, on the coldest day on earth, with a frozen heart. It's a tinkered ticker, but it works. Want to try? Here to wind it up and here... To open it. Do you show your wooden heart to all the girls? You're the first. So, thanks. Don't mention it. No. I can't. I feel the magnet growing in my tummy, drawing me to you but... I'm in love with someone else. And have been for ages. Yesterday, in my dressing room, you reminded me of him. I confess I liked that. But embarking on an adventure with you would be dishonest. I can't do it. Sorry. - Well? - She loves someone else. I crossed half of Europe for her. For nothing! You declared your love? Why? Her heart's full. It won't empty like a sink. - She recognized you? - No. But I'd rather that than be recognized and not loved. She's a spark, but how to tame a spark? Sparks can't be tamed, my young friend. They're like shooting stars. Fleeting! I've never been so sad and happy, all at once. 2 amazing feelings for the price of 1. You're blessed! If only she believed in my heart. She thinks it's a gimmick. Girls like her are wild animals. Born free and beautiful. Don't try to tame her. Even if Miss Acacia falls for you, she'll always escape you. But do you know to whom her heart belongs? I was wondering... You bursting in again? - Do I know him? - Who? The boy you love. - No. - No, you're not in love? No, you don't know him. It's been such a long time since I saw him... It was in Edinburgh. The huge city suited him so well. The spiky spires soaring in the twilight. He was a bit scary, but I was reassured by his odd silhouette. Cut out those tricks, it's dangerous. You'll hurt someone. Take it off now and then. I can't. It's not a gimmick, it's my heart! I'm sorry. I'd be delighted to be your friend. Truly. Let's go to Story Extraordinary. They have a new storytelling gadget. It's called a film. I'd love to go with you. Perhaps. Ladies and gentlemen, and young ladies! Tonight, for your delight, the greatest magic show on earth, no, the galaxy! You see, for years, I've tried to sew dreams and reality into a single fabric of exciting duplicity. I started with photos, but they lacked the essential... movement! Cinematography is shamanic! Summoning up the shadows, endless possibilities! Soon, this device will raise the dead. The finest remedy to melancholy the world has known! Ladies, ladies, ladies and ladies! Now, the first ever Cinematograph picture, which could only recount the greatest love story of all time! I must express my gratitude to the man who triggered in me the discovery that brought my moving picture machine to life. May I present, on my left, Jack, the human clock! 50 kilos of bone inlaid with crispy cogs, coated with a fine layer of epidermis and freckles, each more succulent than the last. And a heart, ladies and ladies, as big as a clock! In fact, by trying to repair its mechanism, I stumbled on the missing link in my invention. And now, enjoy the film! Bravo, bravo, bravo. Wasn't it good? Yes, it was wonderful. You cried. No, I didn't. I know your Romeo. Not that again! He's evil. He ridiculed me, bullied me, humiliated me, every day, in public. Him? He wouldn't hurt a fly. A fly, sure. Me, he did! Why didn't you fight back? He was much bigger and stronger than me. You must be getting him mixed up. - He was my size. - And some! I only met him once, but I remember it as if it were yesterday. I replay the memory every night before I go to sleep. You're jealous? No. That's not the problem. I wasn't wearing my glasses, because I was singing. I can't be sure I'd even recognize him, but I'm certain he's not your monster. How did you meet him? One rainy day in Edinburgh... Ever since, the sound of the rain is my favorite music. Just before my parents were denounced... Can you stop that? - What? - That. I don't think I can. Never mind. Go on... I was singing, and suddenly someone joined in. We danced. Or, rather, bumped into each other. As if in a bubble. Sorry, I'll spare you the details. No, carry on. On the contrary, I'm enjoying it. I don't know how he did it, but he half-tore my dress. - No? - He did! - And I trod on my glasses. - No way! I had an indescribable feeling, as if anything could happen. I had complete faith, I felt great. More than great. I have something... I have something to tell you! - You had something to tell me? - Yes, yes. So, tell me. I'd really like to... see you tomorrow. Alright. Where? I don't know. The Cinematograph, perhaps? Yes! That's all you had to say? Yes, I think so. - What's wrong now? - Nothing. It's the film. It... It stirred my moving parts. - Oh, my, Georges. - My Georges. Your film was so moving! - I want to be your Juliet. - So do I! No, choose me! She loves me. Jack, the spark tamer! Bravo, my boy! Thanks, but there's a problem. She loves the other me, the Edinburgh me. That's no problem. The other you is still you. Now, you can connect them. Dream and reality. But how do I tell her? Come now... "It's me, Jack! "I left Edinburgh and crossed Europe for you, my love. "Now let's scale the skies together!" I tried that and the words jammed in my throat. You're scared your heart will explode? I think of Madeleine and all the effort she put into me. Don't be scared. Don't you want to live and be loved? # To be seen as a man # # A grown man, a human being # # Who needs no tricks # # A human not a freak. # I should've told her. Help me come up with something. Something, perhaps not. But an idea, possibly. Jack? Jack? Hello? This way, miss. Yes, this way! Sit there. Don't move. The scene is Edinburgh, April 16, 1884. Typically British drizzle besprinkles the city center... # She dances like a bird # # With high heels as her perch # # Her arms and legs in a jumble # # She bumps her nose when she stumbles # # On the cobbles # # I smash my head open # # On trees whose leaves so high # # Seem planted in the sky... # What's that pitter-patter? Yes, what is it? It's rain. Do you like it? Miss Acacia loved the sound of rain but she'd no idea it was in fact the heartbeat of her mini-prince charming. If only, that day, he'd told her what that noise was, a few years later, after Jack had crossed half of Europe, like Don Quixote tilting at impossible dreams, she'd have recognized him because she would have believed in his heart. Then they could sample the peerless magic of blending dream and reality. Go on! Ouch. Ah! What are you doing here? Practicing kissing you while you're sleeping. If you are the boy from my dream in Edinburgh, what stopped you from saying so? Fear you wouldn't remember. I find it hard to believe. Mummy taught me only to believe my own eyes. Put your glasses on. My parents were tricked like that and I never saw them again. That's why I fled Edinburgh. They were so trusting. Too trusting. We were smuggled into Scotland. Mummy and I were illegal aliens. A neighbor promised to help us. Next day, he came with policemen. I lay so long in the snow that my feet froze. So did my eyes in places. I cried ice tears. I never had good sight, but since then, even with glasses, I can hardly see at all. I wind my heart with this key. Without it, I'd fall to sleep forever. You can open it, wind it up, do anything you want. It doesn't hurt? Not exactly. Is that normal? Yes. Don't worry. It's just I've been in love with you so long. Trust me. Keep going. # You are the key that opens me totally # # You may explore my body # # From the inside, give my heart a tweak # # To see if I weep # # When your tongue shimmers like a prize # # Gazing in your eyes, I rise # # You make me complete # # My lady key # # My lady key # # I know where to press # # To make you laugh or fry # # I'll scatter butterflies wherever you lie # # To give you the feeling you'll take to the skies # # Flying, flying, pop go your pretty high heels # # Let me suspend time so it lasts # # A fraction longer. # Where've you been? And you! You're wasting your time with him. You're on stage at the bandstand in 5 minutes. Here. I have to go. Keep it. It's the key to your heart. It's yours. No, it's yours now. - Shall we go? - Sorry? After your concert, shall we run for the heels? The hills, you mean! Exactly! Where'd we go? I've no idea, but say yes. Watch out. If you split my skulls, you pay! I'm splitting! What'll you do, you old trinket? Window-dressing at a clockmaker's? In a cemetery? Good idea. I have a grave in my name. Scram! Oh! - Well? - Yes, well? She loves the real me! Congratulations! I'm so happy for you. After her concert, we're taking French bread. French leave, you mean? That as well! In any case, it's all thanks to you. We'll miss you. Write from time to time. Anda... anda... Andalusia! Jack? You're early, your clock's fast. Joe? What are you doing here? It was my dream to see Andalusia. As I'd kept the birthday cards you sent, I said to myself, I'll go and see my Miss Acacia. With any luck, I can hear her sing. That's nice. You're leaving? Yes, with the man I loved when I was little, Jack. We leave tonight. You're going with him? Congratulations. I didn't recognize him at first, but I think I always knew. Funny. Running into my childhood enemy again. Here? His heartbeat's haunted my nights since school. I can't stand hearing a clock now. It drives me mad. Right, I'm ready. At the time, little Jack, with his air of a sad bird. I never realized how dangerous he was. Dangerous? You've noticed he doesn't have a normal heart? I've noticed. That thing of his, shaped like a clock. It's not a heart, it's a grenade, a time-bomb. I should know, I paid to find out. That's impossible. Jack wouldn't hurt a fly. Except when he loses control of his heart and fails to abide by the 3 rules. What rules? # Firstly never touch # # The hands of your heart # # Rule number two # # Keep your temper under control # # Last but not least # # The most important rule # # Whatever else you do # # Never fall in love. # You want to make me a murderess? What do you mean? Joe told me it all. The 3 rules, his eye, everything! Joe? You can't lie your way out of it! Joe's here? How could you hide that from me? Who are you? Who am I... Who was I falling for? I could kill you! I don't want to love you! I refuse to be your murderess! That's not love. You're selfish! You've got it wrong! You didn't gouge his eye? It was an accident. I'd rather it never came to that, but he forgot to mention all he did to me. He deserved to lose an eye for it? Of course not. But why'd he come here to tell you all this? To steal you from me! To protect me from you! He never protected anyone! He terrorized everybody. Look at what he's doing to us now! Great. Lose your temper, too. Listen... Don't touch me. Ah! - Ah! - Stop that! You scare me. I'm sorry. It's raining. Leave me alone. My love for you is offbeat because of my makeshift heart, but it's true love. Madeleine forbade me to fall in love, yet I put my life in your hands. Since I saw you sing and we bumped into each other, all I wanted was to find you. I can face anything for you. I can do anything for you. Apparently. What you're doing now is just crazy! I know and it's driving me nuts. I'd prefer you to be nuts than dead. Now, go. Go away, please. # Years and years spent reflecting and ruminating # # Unable to accept my adventure had been terminated # # Miss Acacia haunts my mind however hard I try # # I set out to find her and the man who poked out my eye # # That's right I'm back I'm here to take action # # I won't stay in Edinburgh floundering in woe and dejection # # In my dreams my love for her is undying # # Now it's time to win her back or I'll die trying # # I couldn't wait to see again my worst enemy, little Jack # # And hearing that cursed clock immediately took me back # # When I caught a glimpse of him I felt the pressure rise # # We needed to have a talk but I saw hatred in his eyes # # I explained that losing one of mine changed me forever # # I'd suffered for being different and revenge was not my agenda # # Bullying him in the past cost me an eye and now we're quits # # The only battle I want with Jack is one of wits # # I understand he hates me for all the torment he sustained # # I humiliated and persecuted him, caused him every type of pain # # But asking about Miss Acacia from day one was pretty dense # # With just that single phrase he signed his death sentence # # What we have in common is that we'd do anything for her # # And older and wiser we can forget the scraps and slurs # # I'll take Miss Acacia home to Edinburgh to begin again # # But first I offer Jack a duel and may the best man win. # You have only yourself to blame. You made it too easy for me. I was looking forward to a tougher opponent. You don't deserve her. Earlier, in her dressing room, she threw herself into my arms. - I hate you! - No, Jack! No! Stop that! Come away. He's out of control. He's broken! I want to change heart. Transplant me. I'm sick of it breaking down. Madeleine was right. With some camera parts, I could try to repair you but... No more repairs! I want something solid and new. I think your problem lies deeper than your clock. Give me a new heart and rewind everything. I never want to fall in love again. I understand, my friend. You need time. Nothing but time. I'm out of time. I gave my key to Miss Acacia. You gave the key of your heart to a spark? Where is she now? She left with Joe. But that key is your life. You were aware of the risk. I know. Hurry back to Madeleine! She's your only hope. When did you last wind yourself up? I don't remember. Quickly! No, it's better if you stay here. I knew the risks, as you said. I must face the consequences. Anyway, you're making your voyage to the moon. The two-in-one formula suits you perfectly. Take courage, mon ami. Courage isn't what I'm lacking. You think Jack will be okay? Do you think he'll go back to Edinburgh? He has his family there. I don't know, but if he does decide to go home, he's in for a nasty surprise. Why? Just after Jack left, Madeleine the sorceress was sent to prison. She wasn't very... Sorry, my left front wheel has shattered. Wasn't very what? Happy to be in a cell. She didn't stay long. She died a few days later. They say she died of grief over Jack. Over Jack leaving, you mean? If you like. He brings bad luck wherever he goes. What's wrong? - Jack gave me his key before we left. - Wait. I have to go back. Excuse me, do you know where Jack is? He's left for Edinburgh. Just as I feared. I have his key. Don't worry, Dr. Madeleine, who saved him as a baby, will find a way to piece his heart together. - She's dead! - What? Go after him! Save him! That's all he asks. He's headed to Valencia. You can catch him before the train leaves. Hold on, wait a second. Here's the journal I've kept since I met Jack, something to read on the long journey ahead. Thank you. At his age, besides rowing and magic tricks, my life was empty. But Jack... His dreams were incarcerated in the wooden cage of his heart. Little Miss Acacia had opened the floodgates. I've never seen one person dream of another with such intensity. It wasn't a cuckoo-clock but an electric volcano grafted onto him. He could have shrunk, after so long spent in the rain on our journey. A real Don Quixote. When he tilts at his dream, he's intractable. Unstoppable. # I'll die alone, but I don't know where # # I'll die alone, but I don't know where # # Oh # # Oh # # Get some # # Oh # # Get some # # Oh # # Get some. # Jack! - My poor boy! - Thanks. You still look like a shrimp with muscles! I think Jack has gone and caught a head cold. Gently does it. Hello, Arthur. Rust has invaded his spine. When he moves, it grates. He's become scared of the cold and rain since... Where's Madeleine? Jack, listen to me. I must say words that weigh so heavy that I worry they might stay stuck in my throat. The day you left. We saw you onto the train. Then Anna and I climbed the hill. The front door was wide open. Nobody was home! The workshop looked like a hurricane had hit it. Madeleine's remedies were scattered. Even the cat was gone. With Arthur, we went looking for her. In the end, we found her in St. Calford Prison. - In prison? - Yes. The police arrested her after we left. It wasn't the first time they'd jailed her. We weren't really worried. I want to see her. I'd like to tell you she is free now. - Cooking with one hand. - Fixing someone with the other. And that, despite missing you badly, she's fine. But... Madeleine has gone. She left her body in prison. Sadness will overwhelm you, but remember you brought her the joy of being a mother. It was the dream of a lifetime for her. She saw you as a fragile little thing, to be protected at all cost, joined to her by that cord in the form of a clock. She dreaded the day when you'd become an adult. I'm stopping here and I'd advise you to do the same, miss. It's haunted up there. Jack! It's me! Jack. It's not too late, I can still save you. You just have. No, let me turn the key in your heart. You came back here for me. You couldn't do anything more extraordinary for my heart. - Thank you. - No. Now, whatever happens to me, the responsibility is all mine. You can kiss me now. # What about the weather, I've got you # # What about the weather, I've got you # # Under my skin # # What about the weather, I've got you # # What about the weather, I've got you # # Under my skin # # What about the weather, I've got you # # Under my skin. # # Oh, my baby, my little one # # How romantic it could be # # To climb the sky # # Walking on a stair of stars # # That's shining blue... # Wow. # And build a hammock of clouds # # Between the south and the north of the half-moon # # And love you again and again and again and again # # I hang my head like a snowflake man # # In a burning sun # # Because I'm my own ghost # # I'm really dead this time # # I'm dead like the corpses # # In their six feet under graves # # How romantic it could be # # To climb the sky # # In a hammock made of clouds # # A hammock made of clouds # # A hammock made of clouds # # My little one # # Yes, a hammock made of clouds # # My baby, my little one # # My baby, my little one # # A hammock # # Made of clouds # # My little one. # # I never laughed so hard # # As I did on that cavalry charge # # I don't bother with watches or charts # # I keep time with my cuckoo clock heart # # Knock me down with a feather of fluff # # But I'd shoulder the earth soon enough # # To find you again # # In sharp stiletto heels you can tell how she feels # # From the spines of her cactus heart # # Love for her was the spring that sprung in his clockwork heart # # Fell apart # # In sharp stiletto heels you can tell how she feels # # From the spines of her cactus heart # # Love for her was the spring that sprung from his clockwork heart # # Fell apart # # Chasing dreams all the lonely nights # # Gold and silver sparkles so bright # # Even buried under the sea # # Her precious lie would still reach me # # Treasure hunting for so long # # I don't know if she'll ever belong to me # # Miss Acacia # # In sharp stiletto heels you can tell how she feels # # From the spines of her cactus heart # # Love for her was the spring that sprung in his clockwork heart # # Fell apart # # In sharp stiletto heels you can tell how she feels # # From the spines of her cactus heart # # Love for her was the spring that sprung from his clockwork heart # # Fell apart... # Oh, there's nothing quite so amusing as recklessness.
