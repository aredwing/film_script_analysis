What the fuck is wrong with you? You cannot take the law into your own fucking hands. I can't keep cleaning up your shit. I'm suspending you. I want you to go away, go far fucking away. I'll clean this shit up. I'm telling you, he sounded like a little girl. It was pathetic. So I told him to shut the hell up. "They're all over me." I'm thinking he's snake-bit or he walked into a hornet's nest. No, a squirrel had run up his pant leg. "The varmint was going for my nuts!" - His peanuts. Good day, gentlemen. Now it's a good day. What was so funny? Wouldn't you like to know? We were just talking about nuts. You like nuts, Alexa? I work with you guys, don't I? Them ain't the type of nuts we're talking about, Alexa darling. Alexa darling? Why doesn't anybody ever say "Boyd darling"? Boyd, I believe you're half homo. Uh, no. Total faggot. Yeah, I'm about 30 away. I was so scared. And all the stuff I see on TV didn't help. I told you not to be watching that stuff. Santana, you're driving me crazy. Well, no need to worry. I'm almost home. Hey, I have a surprise for you. I don't care about that. Just get home. And you shouldn't be video-chatting while driving. You got to be kidding me. Baby, hold on. What? Wait. I need to tell you something. Oh, you motherfuckers. If you're not working on a case, you need to get your asses out into the field and write some tickets. Let's go. You got anything for me, Hannah? - I sure do. - Oh, thank you. At least somebody's doing their job around here. Hey, where are Clark and Holtz? They're on the old road, Santana's due in today. Get out. How come they're out on the old road? You're supposed to be out on the old road. Nothing? And what is with your hair? I told you to get it cut. After the rodeo, Sheriff. It gets me laid. Where's Stuckey? He's in the can. How come your badge is on the wrong side? It's supposed to be over there. McCain lost his. - Sheriff, can I have a minute with you? - What? Yeah. File that. We got shit to do, Boyd. Yeah. Hey! When am I gonna get my phone call? I told you, later. Sheriff, man, this guy ain't gonna give me the phone. You won't give him the phone. Make your damn phone call. What the hell is it, Boyd? What do you want? I'm a busy man. Sir, it's about this piece of shit bonus. For everything we're bringing in, it ought be more, a lot more. Oh, is that right? Yes, sir. It ought to be a lot more. Believe so- Let me tell you something. You are damn lucky that I'm not a violent man. Now you happen to be the worst of my bunch. Don't make me sorry you're here. Okay? Do we have an issue? No. No issue. Good, good to hear. What do you want? The Mayor's here to see you. Thank you. Go. You need to give the prisoners their phone call. Yes, sir. What? Don't give me that look. Don't fuck this up, Boyd. Whatever. Mayor Dorsey, you wanted to see me. What's up? We've got a situation here. That's what's up. - Huh. - There's just a few days away from the festival starting. I can't have happening this year what we had last year. Can you remind me what that was? Posts! We got more horses coming into town than we have posts to tie them to, we can't have that. Posts? Posts. Don't you worry about it, I'm on it. Reid? Get your ass down to the festival and make sure we have twice as many posts as we did last year. Why don't you put Boyd on that? Why don't you get your ass down to the festival and make sure we have twice as many posts as we did last year? - Okay. - Posts. Good. Is there anything else? Well, hey there, Santana. Long time no see. Officers. You been across the border, Santana? No. Coming from Dallas. - Dallas? - Yeah. Well, Dallas is north of here and you're headed north. You know what I think? I think our friend here did come from the border. He brought back some party favors that he don't want to share with his amigos. Looks like we have a piata of interest. Just candy. Well, I like candy. Candy is good. Ho-ho. Hello, party favors. Santana, I'm a victim of disappointment in you. Come on, guys, give me a break. The Sheriff knows me. I've done favors for him. Believe me, he knows my boss. I don't know what you're talking about, Santana. Where's the money? I don't have any. Where's that fucking cash, boy? John, believe me, I don't have any money. What'd you call me? John. We went to high school together. Come on, man, give me a break. I didn't know y'all were such good friends, Clark. You disrespectin' me, wetback? Not at all. Get the fuck down out of there, boy, now. I'm gonna teach you some respect, beaner. Now, what's my name? Clark. That's officer Clark, you fucking Mexican. Come on, guys. Take the coke, just let me slide. What do you think, Holtz? Well, if he gave us the cash, maybe. But, since he hasn't... Look, Santana, all we gotta do is spread a little coke around, kill your sorry ass, looks like a drug deal gone bad. I'm telling you guys, believe me, I don't have any cash. Now, boy, I will take my time busting you up till I get that money. Wait a second. Officer Holtz, Officer Clark... Let's talk this out. Whoa, whoa. What's he calling our names out like that for? Are you wearing a wire, boy? - Hmm? - No, no. You trying to set us up here? No. Hi, Selena. Wait, wait. Amigo, you just killed your wife. The money's with her. No, no, no, no, Officer Clark, please. Looks like we got ourselves a double homicide. Come on, John, please don't do this, man. 26, requesting backup, just north of marker 51 on the old road. Apparent drug deal gone bad. Hannah, was that Holtz? Yes, Sheriff, it was. Thank you. You're welcome. Gant. I want you and Stuckey on this. - Okay. - Go on, go on. Reid, back him up. Copy that. What's going on? You can stand down, I got enough men on this as it is. Come on, Sheriff, I want in. No, just stay here. Okay? In case the phone rings, answer it, it's important. Boyd, you're riding with me. Whoa, bro, okay, okay, okay, I'm not disrespecting you, you earned your stripes, I got it. I got it, I got it. Just don't do anything, please, man. You went to high school with her, you know her. You said you want us to let you go, boy. What you doing standing here? Go. Santana, get it through your thick head. If you don't run, you're gonna die right here where you stand. I said go, Mexican. Well, guess he's a Mexi-can't. Officers! This is a police matter, sir. - For your own safety, continue on your way. - What's going on? You shut your mouth, boy, do as you're told. Now move on there or I will arrest you. Son of a bitch. Damn. Son of a bitch is out of range. Looks like he's headed towards Brown's Lake. Put the word out. Dispatch, this is 26, suspect heading towards Brown's Lake on foot, armed and dangerous. 26, this is 10. We are at the other side of the river. Copy 10, heading your direction. Hey, I see him over there. I think I got him. I think not. Let's go. Gant, I see him, that's him. That is him! - Well, let 'em know. - 26, this is 10. We have a 20 on your suspect. He is heading towards Bohemian Hall. Best part of the job, partner. Best part of the job. I'm with you. Let's get him. Let's have ourselves some fun, huh? Santana? We know you're in here. Come out, amigo. Listen... Reid here has never lost a fight... and I likes me a good fight. So if you can come out and kick his ass... we will let you go... Scot-free. You can trust us. We're deputies. If you don't... we're gonna go to your house... and kill your wife. I beat him... you let me go? You will walk right out of here. That's the deal. Let's see what you got, boy. Let's get it on! You'll have to do better than that. Ol. That means "you're getting your ass kicked" in Mexican. I can handle this. Come on. Let's go. Is that all you got? Now, listen. What, no fight left? Still undefeated. Reid? That's one dead burrito. Well... can I help you? Yes. I'd like to file a complaint. Well, if you'd like to file a complaint, see Alexa. Right over there. Boyd? Pardon me, ma'am. My name is Jack Justice. I want to file a complaint. What seems to be the trouble? I saw two police officers beating up a defenseless man. You mean they were using excessive force? They was kicking his ass. Dispatch, this is 26. We have a 187 at the north side of Brown's Lake. Do we have a possible ID on the body? Yes, Ray Santana. Go for Alexa. I need you to go over to the Santana home and break the news to his wife. Copy that. Pardon me, officer, can I go on a ride along? I don't think that's a good idea. I'm a police officer also. LAPD. Hannah, what do you think? Well, he is an officer, won't hurt to take him with you. All right. Come on. All right, gentlemen, talk to me. What do we got? Sheriff, looks like cause of death's a broken neck. Yes, it does. Looks like cause of death was a broken neck. Any other possible witnesses? A big black guy pulled up asking if he could help but... we sent him on his way. Big black guy? Yes, sir. This big black guy see anything? He might have seen Santana bolt. I see the cocaine. Is there any money anywhere? No, that's all we found. Not one red cent. Yeah, right. Boyd, you are a whining, complaining son of a bitch, aren't you? Well, sir, I'd be more happy if we found money instead of cocaine. He'd be much happier. Come here, Boyd, I want to talk to you for a sec. Come on. Let me see your gun. Oh, that's a nice gun. Yes, sir. Got a good weight to it. Hey, Sheriff, what did you do that for? Because he got on my nerves. Any you boys have any problem with the way I handle things around here, speak up now. Little warning next time, I think you might have blown out my eardrum. Any other possible witnesses? - Oh, crap, the phone. - What about the phone? Santana was video-talking with his wife and she saw me. Let's go. So what brings you to our small town? Nothing. I'm just driving through on my way to Mexico. Mexico? My pops retired there 2 years ago. Hmm. So, uh... why Red Mesa? Hometown girl. As a matter of fact, that's my house right there. Okay. I never knew how to leave. Just point your car north and drive. Some day. So, um, what did you do before you were a cop? I used to make problems disappear. So what's it like here? You know, small town, small town people, small town ideas. Sounds small. Hey, are you making fun of me? Just a little bit. Before I forget, um, I have the pass codes to our social media websites and there the cops get to write about what they do and who they are, and people just love it. I'm cool, sis, I'm not an officer here. I know, but you can give them a big city perspective. I'm old-school, though, sis. If I can't put a stamp on it, I don't send it. Hey, don't worry, I'll get you up to speed. I'm cool. What's wrong? I'm not looking forward to this. Are you talking about Santana's wife? Selena and I, we used to be really good friends in high school. Wow. You became a cop and she became a drug dealer's wife? Yep. Bad choice. Who is it? It's Officer Alexa. Alexa, who the hell is this? What's he doing here? It's okay, Sheriff. He's one of us. He's one of us? Don't kid yourself, pretty little thing, you aren't even one of us. Is that right? Are you a Po-lice man? Yes, sir. Oh. From the big city, I'm guessing. That's right, sir. Ooh. Ah. You're all sweaty. Are you nervous about something, boy? No, sir. No, sir? You just happened to be wandering through our little town, is that right? Correct, sir. I'm correct, sir. I like you. I really do. This the fella? Yes, it is, Sheriff. "Yes, it is, Sheriff." Oh, that's too bad. Well, don't just stand there, gentlemen, arrest his ass. Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. - Get out of the way, Alexa. - He's one of us! I'm cool. Stuckey? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Fill the void. A wetback and a nigger are riding in a car. Who's driving? I do not know. Who is driving that car, Stuckey? A cop. You should have skipped this part of town, boy. One day, one day real soon, me and you gonna have a serious conversation. I'll look forward to it. Let's go, Shrek. Lock him up. Sheriff Payden's personal favorite. Now if the Flintstones were an old black family, what would they be called, huh? The niggers. I need to talk to our guest. Sheriff Be careful, don't get too close to that cell. This isn't the pound, he's not gonna bite me. I don't know, he looks like a junkyard dog to me. Mr. Justice, I find myself in the embarrassing position of having to find a scapegoat. See, I have two murders I have to account for. Oh, yeah. So I'm the man of the hour, huh? Oh, no, no, no. You are the man of the year. Do you know how I know it is that I'm loved? You should have died at birth? I realize that... perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot, my men using the N-word out there and just now the nnn... I can't even get myself to say it. It's a bad word. But I assure you that neither myself nor my men ever want to have to stoop so low as to intentionally have to call any black man, woman or child... neighbor. Neighbor. Oh, come on, that's funny. You know what, Sheriff? What is it? You and your racist redneck band of deputies are about to get a little of my justice. And believe me, you're not gonna like it. Nah, I just don't think that that's gonna happen. It's a good idea, but see, later on this afternoon, you are going to be shot and you are going to be killed because you're gonna be trying to escape. - You know what, Sheriff? - Hmm? Your problem is you think you've got Flipper in here. Well, motherfucker, say hello to Jaws. Oh? Well, Jaws is goin' down. Just when you thought it was safe to get back in the jail cell. "Jaws". I'll ask. Excuse me, Mayor? The papers would like an exclusive regarding Officer Justice. Well, how did they get that so fast? From the police blog. Well, call that girl there and tell her to stop. We've been flooded with calls all day wanting to know just how dangerous Officer Justice is. You know what? Just refer all of my calls to Sheriff Payden. Yes, sir. Yeah. I hid the money. I can't believe they killed Santana. - Okay. - This just in. - Thank you, big brother. - Sheriff Payden of Red Mesa PD says they've apprehended the suspect of the murder of police officer Carter Boyd and alleged drug dealer, Ray Santana. The suspect is troubled officer Jack Justice of the Los Angeles PD, who, just a few days earlier, was involved in a sporting goods store shootout which cost him the life of his partner, officer Dan Henderson. Justice killed the robbery suspects. It is also reported that Justice had left a manifesto on the Mesa PD website confessing to the murders, vowing he would never be taken alive and that he would take revenge on those officers who have wronged him. Stay tuned, we will have more information as it unfolds. 411, how may I direct your call? - Get me the Mayor. - One moment, please. Let's go. We're taking you out of here. Come on! Oh, look at that. He's put on his pretty little hoodie, huh? Yeah. No, baby, I swear she didn't mean anything. You must think I'm a real bad man. Yeah, not really, boy. We don't need that, put that away. Move, nigger. Everybody get down! Go for Payden. Alexa, please don't shoot me. Damn it, Jack, you're under arrest. Don't move. I don't want to kill you, but I will if I have to. I won't leave this chair if you just put the gun down. I just need you to think why I came to your house. Why are you here? Outside of the Boy Scouts, you're the most honest person here. Red Mesa is a corrupt police department, sis, and you know. Why do you think they never let you on police business? They don't want me to see what's going on. Red Mesa Police Department is the most corrupt police department I've ever seen. It's true. But what about Boyd? Who's Boyd? Well, what about all the damage and all the people you hurt back at the station? I did hurt a lot of people at that police station, but I didn't kill nobody. And believe me, little sis, I'm good at killing. Clear it and call it. You know, I need you to put all this together right now 'cause I don't have a lot of time left. I'm gonna need your help. I'm gonna need to take your unmarked unit. Dnde estel dinero? Por fa-fucking-vor. Yeah? I need to call in that one favor. Where are you? You know what, Sheriff? You're gonna spend the rest of your life in prison, Sheriff Payden. Oh, is that a fact? Well, I tell you what, boy, I don't think that's gonna happen because I have something out here that you want really, really bad. Little chica named Selena. Listen... Help me, please! I didn't do anything! "Help me, please! I didn't do anything!" You gonna let this young lady die out here, or are you gonna be a hero and come get her? If you touch that girl... Oh, no, I don't think so. Anyway, I'm not gonna get to kill this little girl because you're gonna come out here and save her, aren't you, hero? You know, Sheriff? You're one stupid man. Afraid that's a matter of opinion, Jack. What's it gonna be? You gonna come out here, you gonna save the girl? Or am I gonna turn her over to my boys to have something to play with? Yeah, I'm coming. But I'm coming for you. He's coming for me. Bring it on! Magnum! Hey, come here, boy. Clark. Finally awake. What the fuck you hit me with? It was on your porch. You have no idea who you're messing with. Yeah? I've been told that before. It just didn't work out. The best thing you can do is just clear on out of here. Yeah. Let's talk about... how you're gonna die. Die? Son, I'm an officer of the law. You don't cut me loose, I will tear your ass inside out. Man, I'm not a man for blood and guts, but I did grow up in Compton. But you know what? I'm gonna make an exception for you. The hell you runnin' on about? I want to know where that girl is. Selena? I ain't ever known no darkie give two shakes about a beaner. What's she to you? She'll take me right to the Sheriff. Damn, boy, you got to be about as dumb as you is ugly. Well, I sure as shit ain't gonna tell you now. Okay. Have it your way. Oh, motherfucker. You bleed a lot. That ain't so bad... shoot 'em all off. Okay. You cocksucker, I swear to Christ I will never tell you where that... Where that fucking bitch is now. You know what, Clark? I'm starting to believe you. So I'm gonna take off 'cause I'm running out of patience... and you're running out of fingers. Hey. What do you need? Let me have a smoke. Okay. You know what, Clark? You shouldn't smoke these things. 'Cause these... are gonna kill you one day. Afternoon, gentlemen. Good afternoon. Nice day for a rodeo. I'm Agent Cobb. This is Agent Lobo. I'm Mayor Dorsey. Perhaps you're familiar with the Dorsey name. My great-granddaddy fought alongside Davy Crockett at the Alamo. What brings you boys here to Red Mesa? It's not about that murder business, right? Hey, hey, hey. That's my business, all right? I'll take care of it. Well, actually, Mayor, it does have something to do with the murder business. Do you have a suspect yet? Yeah. I do. Does he have a name? Yes. He does. What is it? His name is Jack Justice. He's a crazy cop out of Los Angeles, has a habit of breaking people's necks and then shooting them. Bad habit. And you think he's still in town? I know he's still in town 'cause he's one mean son of a bitch. But let me make something very clear to you: He is my mean son of a bitch. Sheriff, I'd like to go to the station and review your evidence. You go to the station, get yourself a cup of coffee, get yourself a mint julep. As far as the evidence goes, I'll see what I can do. Thank you, gentlemen. He's gonna be trouble. He's not gonna be trouble. I'll drop you off at the station, you see what you can find out. All right. Mayor, if you ever mention my business to anyone outside of my department, so help me God, I will poison your dog. Hello. Hello. How can I help you? I'm Agent Lobo. It's okay, Hannah. I'll take it from here. - Okay, Alexa. - Follow me please. I'm Officer Alexa. Lobo. Agent Lobo. What exactly do you do? I clean up messy situations. Do you have jurisdiction here? I can go anywhere. Well, you got your hands full. Tell me what you think you know. I believe that Justice is innocent, Santana was killed in a drug takedown, and somehow Boyd just got killed in the process. Who's involved in the drug heist? Everyone at the station except for Hannah and myself. Names. Give me names. Gant, Stuckey, Clark, McCain and Reid. So why don't you think this Justice is the guy? All the media is reporting that he posted a manifesto on the social media website. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. And he couldn't have because he doesn't have the password. To post the manifesto? Exactly. And how do you know this? 'Cause I'm the one that gives out the password. Sorry to hear that, Alexa. Your weapon. We're going for a ride. You try to be a hero, you die. Let's go. Sheriff Payden, this is Hannah, come back. Go for Payden. Sheriff, we just got a call from Holly Brown. She's said that Clark's house blew up. Anybody say whether Clark is still alive or not? It's not looking good. There's a burned body tied to a radiator. I want you to patch me through to Jim Thorpe, he needs to get his airplane up in the sky. And, uh, who has a helicopter? Hmm... Bill Cherry, get Bill Cherry on the horn, tell him I want him to go up there, see if they can't find this Justice son of a bitch pronto. Roger that, Sheriff. Stuckey, Payden. You got your ears on? Go for Stuckey. Stuckey, I need you to haul ass over to Clark's, apparently he's on fire. Roger that, Sheriff. Shall we put him out? No, you should go over there and make s'mores. Yes, you should put him out, you idiot. I'm in a cesspool of idiots. You're part of this, too? What's wrong with you people? You know what your problem is, Alexa? You still believe in the tooth fairy. You know what your problem is? You believe crime pays. It pays more than this fucking badge. Alexa! Selena! Uh-oh. That's gotta hurt. I can't believe it. Oh, man. Alright that's brutal. Tied him to the radiator, couldn't even get away. I've known him my whole life. Thorpe is in the air. Come on, Holtz, we'll get the SOB, Alright, we'll get him. What the hell happened here? What's it look like? The house burned down. You guys can handle this, we're gonna go meet up with the Sheriff. All right. It's Lobo. I'm a little busy at the moment. Leave a message. Call me. I'm at the hotel. I can't believe he blew him up. Holtz, I got one for you. Yeah. Hey, why do decent white folk shop at nigger yard sales, huh? Huh? To get their belongings back. Welcome, all shoppers. We got a special on rednecks today. Now just drive. Well, I'll be a son of a bitch. Hey! What the hell are you doing at my house? I stopped by the station, you weren't there. And that somehow gives you the right to walk through my gate uninvited? You have any news for me? Do I have any news for you? Yeah, I got some news for you. The son of a bitch burned down one of my officer's homes with my officer still in it. Said officer is dead. So then he's still in town? Yes. I told you he's still in town and I'm gonna find him. I certainly don't need any chickenshit federal man interfering with my business. That would be you. Let me ask you something, Sheriff. Why do you think that this man just comes into your town and starts killing people like this? Are you questioning me? Are you questioning my authority in my town? I think he's doing it because he's one crazy son of a bitch, that's why. Well, then we better find him. Where's the girl? What, you're gonna kill me? What... What do you think Sheriff's gonna do to me if I tell you where she is? I hope she's dead anyway! Okay. Hey! Stop! Hey... stop! No! Holtz! Holtz! No! Whoa, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, she's in a barn, she's in the barn! On Old Camp Road at the Davies' barn! Please don't kill me, I told you... I got a joke for you. What is Barney Rubble's son's name? Please, please, I don't want to die... His name ain't please-I-don't-want-to-die, tell me his name. Please don't kill me! I don't want to die, I don't... Bam-Bam. It's Lobo. I'm a little busy... Excuse me, ladies. It's okay, mister. Are you the judge in the beauty contest? No, I'm not, dear, but, uh... if I was, I'd vote for you and you two girls would win, I think. Come on, girls. Let's go. - Bye. - Bye! It's good to see you, Cody. Sorry for seeing you in these crazy circumstances. Let's get out of here. You know this is not gonna end well. Yeah, I know that. Why don't you just let it go and get the hell out of here? You know I can't do that. Look, I don't know what happened and I really don't care. I owe you. I think I'm paid in full. Hmm. We good? Yeah. We're way good. You watch your ass, huh? You got it. The Sheriff better sleep with his lights on. Whoo! How about another kiss? Hey. Cool it, Randall. Let's wait for the chief. Hey. I'm game. Hey, shut him up. Watch this. Kick his ass! Kick his fuckin' ass! All right. Yeah. See something you like, cupcake? Uncuff me and let me kick your ass. Oh, really? She thinks she's gonna whoop your ass, Gant. I always knew Latinas were fiery. Let's see what you got. Come on. Oh, that's so cute. Oh, that's cute. She ain't playin'. I do believe that's the most action you've seen in years without paying for it. Oh, hey she's really choking you, bro. Yeah she's choking you out! She ain't playin'. Alexa. Stop, you'll kill her! McCain? Let's go check this out. If you're gonna hit me, hit me. Hey, Gant, what about having a little conversation now? Let's talk. Hey, Justice, don't forget about me. Lobo, better catch up. Stop! No more killing. Be still. Oh, shit. No... No! Where did he go? You okay? I think so. We're okay. We'll be all right. Ladies, it was a pleasure. How many bodies were recovered at the scene? I don't know, a lot. Well, was Jack Justice one of the bodies recovered? Mayor, what about the drugs that were found? I don't know anything about that. This is a black eye for Red Mesa. Mayor, a black eye? We got 12 dead bodies. I just don't know anything. Excuse me. Yes. Can I help you? I wanted to know how Agent Lobo was doing. Lobo? You mean as in "wolf"? Yeah. Is he okay? Ma'am, I don't know an Agent Lobo. Sure you do, he's partners with Agent Cobb. Ma'am, I can assure you there's no Agent Cobb or Lobo that's working on this case. What exactly do you do? I clean up messy situations. I used to make problems disappear. Do you have jurisdiction here? I can go anywhere. Yeah. Where are you? Let's go. Born this way, I was born this way I was born this way I was b-b-b-b-b... My spirit starts shit, my mind's hot-wired You can't blame me for it You spark my fire I paid a lot more I walk a tight wire I w-w-w-walk a tight wire I walk a tight wire I insist I'm insane, for instance Just so intense Do you got that kind of comfort Keep that don't want to start with a bang Don't think I'll ever be there it's a big suspense It's a big suspense I keep hearing these voices screaming "pull it" And I listen, I'm dangerous I blow up Demolition They ask for patience Well, I'm sick of waiting I get down to business Don't ask for forgiveness I live my life dangerous till I overdose on it I was born to be bad I was born to be bad, I was born to be bad I was born to be bad I consume death, the devil I digest I keep him locked in my closet I bury every skeleton The hell with it I'm raising hell again Out of the darkness Not afraid to start shit I got so many demons They're starting to start a riot I get so crazy and I can't stay quiet I'd fucking lose it If I ever heard silence My words are deadly, don't murder gently Afraid of nobody, my hands are steady It's getting heavy, I hope you're ready You better take me seriously stop the bulk of me You're actually helping me Death is my remedy Leave it to me to give it a quick squeeze When I botch the plan they will leave if I ask for this, babe, do it, please Be the baddest mother... I was born to be bad I wasn't born with options Everyone trying to tell me to be good Drop it, I was born this way I was born with swag I'm so fresh, it's an accident You couldn't be bad if you paid I'm that bad motherfucker Whip that bad motherfucker limp I'm getting justice I'm gonna make you my fucking bitch I came from nothing, I still got nothing That's some scary shit and sure to fuck with this Lost my whole life so nothing to prove, I'm done explaining, I got nothing to lose I get a bad rap I don't give one back, I refuse When I feel like the end's near Like I need some good last words And I'm so fucked up It's like I got the barrel backwards But I was born a fucking bad ass Fucking pussy ass coward Backed into a corner Claustrophobic and got to get out You're lucky as hell If you just get knocked the fuck out I guess blame your parents It must be their fault You can't be like me I'll show you what being bad's all about I was born to be bad
