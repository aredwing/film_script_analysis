Sure. THE PRIORY What are you doing here, ma'am? I... I, uh ... I thought maybe the door could open. Well ... not. No, uh ... No, uh ... Okay, uh ... I'm looking for Agatha. Do you know her? Sure. I lived 25 years next to her. Okay, uh ... 'IF you expect her to come home? Unfortunately not. Agatha's new home is in "Old Park". At the cemetery. You mean she's dead? I'm afraid so. Jesus... What happened? Who are you, ma'am? Agatha has a few years worked for me. The truth is that I Agatha few important items to know. And, uh ... I really want her back as ... as I can. Do you mind? Well then. Hello, hello, Doctor Franklin. Hey... Yeah, uh ... this is Paul Otto. Pretty, uh ... Do you have a moment, anyway? It's about my wife, Jenny. And, uh ... and my son, Gene. Hey. Hey...

Not like to hear it, which is really bad news. Yeah, uh ... anyway, uh ... I want to know if we can talk. This is I think not so good. I am sorry. To be honest ... I come from far away, and ... I will not take up too much time. But... 5 minutes. Well... Yes that is... 5 minutes. Thank you. Come on in. Thank you. Hey, Gene ... Did you Robert caught the scvhuur? No. Why was he in the barn? Are you... your mother has put him in there. Oh no! What? Robert is going to be angry. So you want to talk to me about Agatha? Yes. Something. Okay? What does that mean? Well, uh... Agatha has a number of years worked for my family. But she was a bit of ... senile and forgetful. Yeah ... I think actually, uh ... her hearing though slightly deteriorated when they still worked for us. Yeah, I mean ... maybe you already know, but ... we had to let her go. Anyway... Before she left she gave my son a doll. The doll name is Robert. Quiet, please. What? My wife... my wife is upstairs. My wife is upstairs and is not quite right. I'm sorry to hear that. I know of pop. Why are we whispering? Because the doll is why My wife is not well. What do you mean? You have to get from there. Evil can be contagious. Hey, where you going, buddy? To bed. Goodbye, Dad. Maybe we can just say goodnight, Gene. I know that. But this time it's "goodbye". I never knew puppets could be spooky or possessed. When a spirit finds its way in the heart of a house a doll or toy the perfect host. Evil disguised as innocence. No one would suspect anything. And the evil spirit in the pop, I mean, you know who he is? Honey, do not wer here talking about it, it is ... Stop me underrated, I'm fine. Okay. I summoned a clairvoyant in order to do a reading in the house. And they told us that the doll ever Make belonged to a child named Robert Crow. He was murdered. His body was found in a river ... he is still attached to the doll. The police investigation revealed that Robert was murdered by his father. After Robert's death was the doll to his nephew who named it for his family. And, uh ... she soon realized that the doll was possessed ... by the ghost of the murdered boy. They put him in an attic and the spirit remained there for years. Agatha moved to the house Robert Crow's cousin and she found the doll in the attic. The Prophet said ... Agatha was a troubled soul and had experimented with the dark cards. She went straight to the spirit and it gave the power to manifest. My son says Robert ... my husband does not like me. Naturally. Because the mind to proceed. Robert Doll has something against other dolls. When he was confirmed a child he could be very possessive. Jenn, you and your husband in great danger. I locked him in the barn. This is not enough to make these to stop evil spirit. You should go home and destroy the doll. Chop, shred it, burn it, Do what you have to do to destroy it. Or it will destroy you! Oh, come on! Paul? Sweetheart? Lieverrd, wakes up? Are you okay, honey ?! Oh no, dear, will please wake up! You must wake up! Gene. Gene? Gene! Gene! Gene!
