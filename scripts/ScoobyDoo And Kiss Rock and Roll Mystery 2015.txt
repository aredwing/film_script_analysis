How else are those kids gonna get a picture of themselves screaming their heads off? Ha-ha-ha. Scaredy cats. Funny. What seems to be the trouble? I don't know. Every photo has some weird red haze in it. But I'm pretty sure I just fixed it. You smell rotten eggs? What? Water buffalo? Water slide? What is it? - Witch! - Aah! Give me rock! Give me rock! Give me rock! Man, I think we lost her. Give me rock! Whoa! Get out of my way. - There's a... - We saw a... - We saw a... - There's a... - Witch! - Witch! Big deal. A witch, a witch. Pipe down already. You're giving me a headache. Stop getting so excited. But we saw her. She had this grotesque head. It was so frightening. Well, welcome to KISS World. That's the whole point of this park, isn't it? To excite and fright. Now, get back to work. By the way, don't forget your souvenir photo. She's back. Only one thing we can do. Get me the hottest mystery solvers in the world. Like, I can't believe we get to go to KISS World. Ha-ha. And solve a mystery. That's like killing two birds with one stone. Yeah. Or two birds with one cat. Personally, I find their sideshow act a little juvenile. But my mother told me to take a more active role in my friends' interests. Well, I'm pretty interested in Starchild. He's so dreamy. - Hey. - Sorry, everyone. You did that on purpose. Heh. Now it looks like a shooting star. Make a wish, Scoob. I wish I was eating a Scooby Snack. Good one, dude. I wish I could breathe fire like the Demon. Aah! I wish you'd all come to your senses. You don't see me acting ridiculous over my favorite group, the Ascot Five, do you? Don't tug my ascot Don't pull my ascot It's not a scarf You can't have my ascot 'Cause, girl, it's mine Fred, please. I'm just saying, I think they're twice the band KISS is. But do the Ascot Five have an awesome amusement park? Yeah. Awesome amusement park. It is so majorly groovy to be at KISS World on Halloween night. Listen to those crowds. I'm so excited. I think I'm gonna freak out. Apparently you're not the only one. Like, dude, don't most people usually run towards awesome rock concerts? Not at an Ascot Five concert. Everyone walks in a calm, orderly fashion. - Help! - Witch! My gosh, she's so terrifying. - The scariest witch ever. - Witch? - With the red mist. - And the creepy laugh. Save yourself while you can. Wait a minute. The Demon, the Starchild, the Catman, the Spaceman. Ho-ho-ho. Please tell me they added a witch. Somehow I doubt that. In fact, it's probably the reason we're here. Not me. I'm here for the funnel cake. Come on, gang, let's get to work. - Like, excuse me, ma'am. - Sorry. Park's closed. - But we're here to solve a mystery. - Sure you are. You always wear makeup when solving crimes? Heh. I should hope so. She means the KISS makeup. No, we're just excited about the concert tonight. But we're the mystery solvers you called for. I am Delilah Domino, chief of security. Why would I call mystery solvers? What? But Daphne took the call. - Right, Daph? - Well... - Daphne? - Okay. The thing is, no one actually called for our help. What? But when I heard KISS was throwing a special Halloween concert, I just had to come. I mean, look at that poster of Starchild. He stares at me wherever I go. So does the Mona Lisa, but you don't see us on a plane to Italy. Why didn't you just tell us the truth? We all would've come. - Not me. - Exactly. But once we got here, I knew we'd all have a good time. The odds were pretty good there'd be a mystery for us to solve. I mean, we're the Scooby gang, and it's an amusement park. Heh. - Right? - Wrong. It's a closed amusement park. And chances are, there won't be any Halloween concert either. - So go home. - But we've come so far. Heh. Couldn't we at least have some snacks for the road? Maybe some rocky road? Out. All right, time to get serious. It seems KISS needs our help. Like, I'm no guitarist, but I can play a mean armpit. Not to play music, Shaggy, to solve the mystery. Well, then it looks like we'll have to sneak in. - You're okay with this? - Of course I am. It's a mystery, right? And solving mysteries is what we do. Caught some kids trying to stay in the park, Mr. Goldman, but I got rid of them. - I can't believe we're chasing customers away. - I know, but we went over this. Until we solve this witch mystery, it's safer to keep everyone out. Now, don't get crazy, Delilah. Just stay calm because I'm gonna be very honest with you. I called for some backup. Backup? You must be kidding. Mr. Goldman, I am the chief of security. I think I can take care of this unusual situation. Time is not on our side. The witch has scared away too many people. Tonight's Halloween concert is our only chance to bring them back. - Did you hear that? - We got here just in time. Come on. Let's check out the supervisor's office. Hey, Scoob, bet I can beat you in a water-gun shootout. Yeah? You're on. Chip, you don't understand. If KISS doesn't perform tonight, I will lose the park. That's not my concern, Manny. All I care about are the concert tours. Every one of these cities translates into dollar signs. You know what happens if I lose these cities? You have more time to take your kids to KISS World. No, it means I lose money. Every time KISS comes back into the park, it means they're not on the road performing... ...and I'm not selling their merchandise. So forgive me, but as far as I'm concerned, this park can wind up in a toilet. Preferably this KISS toilet. Because I don't know how I'm gonna unload this thing. Looks like Spaceman is spaced out. Ha-ha. Onto Starchild. Heh. One Catman down and one Demon to go. Run for it! Run! 'Shaggy, Scooby, Wait You. I thought I told you kids to stay out. - Hey, hey, hey. Whoa! Whoa! - Sorry. Calm down. I'm Manny Goldman, the park supervisor. What's with all the ruckus? It's these nosy kids again. Fortunately, I used to work for a government defense company... ...so I know how to take down intruders. Like, she's not kidding. Sorry, everyone. We're just trying to help. We overheard that the park is in trouble. And seeing how we're such big KISS fans, we'd like to do all that we can. We've got it under control. Thank you very much. But don't you want the crowds to come back? They'll come back. To see us. You show us everything you've got You keep on dancing and the room gets hot You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy And you say you wanna go for a spin The party's just begun, we'll let you in You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy You keep on shouting You keep on shouting I wanna rock 'n' roll all night And party every day I wanna rock 'n' roll all night And party every day I wanna rock 'n' roll all night And party every day I wanna rock 'n' roll all night And party every day You keep saying you'll be mine for a while You're looking fancy and I like your style You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy And you show us everything you've got Baby, baby, it's quite a lot You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy You keep on shouting You keep on shouting I wanna rock 'n' roll all night And party every day I wanna rock 'n' roll all night And party every day I wanna rock 'n' roll all night And party every day I wanna rock 'n' roll all night And party every day Come on, guys, these special effects cost money. I told you, you can't use them every time you make an entrance. Like, wow, ha-ha-ha, it's KISS. - In person. - And in the flesh. "In the flesh" is the same as "in person." Basically, you have just said the same thing twice. How can we help, little lady? Actually we're here to help you. We're mystery solvers. That's funny. So are we. Wait. You're the ones they called for help? Yeah. They wanted the best, they got the best. But, like, you're a rock band. Every band needs a hobby. The Ascot Five would welcome our help. Well, I guess we're no Ascot Five, so scram. Yeah? Well, amusement-park mysteries happen to be our specialty. We solved the "Foul Play in Funland" case, stopped the Roller Ghoster in his tracks... ...and captured the monster of Our Lady of Mercy's parking lot. I guess that was more of a street fair. That's cute, but we solve mysteries on a cosmic level. What does that mean? It means we don't need your help. Now, hold on, guys. Let's not be hasty. - What? - Really? Not again. You know how the eye sees everything. Well, I just caught a glimpse of the future. Yeah, and I bet the future is a redhead. Ha-ha. You bet. I mean, in a way. Don't ask me how or why... ...but I think we're going to need these kids to catch that witch. You're kidding. They're just humans. Not even all of them. I know, but the eye never lies. - I guess they're okay. - If you think so, Starchild. I do not like this. On second thought, we've decided you can help. That's great. I guess the first question is: Who is this witch everyone's talking about? Give me rock! Obviously you've done this before. Get out of my locker! But it's so cozy. Give me rock! It's like she's searching for something. And I'm going to guess that something is a rock. Do you think you could show us around the park? I'd like to see the places where the witch has been. No problem. Right, fellas? Count me out. The Demon needs to feed the beast. Did he say, "beast"? He means his stomach. Heh-heh. Then my beast is growling too. How about yours, bud? Heh. My beast is starving. Like, catch you later. It's beast-feeding time. I'm ready for that tour now. Heh-heh. If by "tour," you mean "begin the investigation." Let's hit it, fellow mystery solvers. I guess I'll see you out there. Guys, these special effects cost money. Just think, Scooby-Doo, a million fast-food stands just for us. It's like carbohydrate heaven. The Demon. Nice and toasty. Like, wow, I wonder how he does that. Man, if we could breathe fire, we could pop our own popcorn. Yeah. Come on, we gotta get past him. Dude, you sure you know where you're going? Yeah. Cheeseburgers straight ahead. Yoinks! Like, sorry, Mr. Demon. Scooby didn't mean it. He was afraid of your dragon boot. I don't suppose you could wear an open-toed demon sandal? That was close. Could've been worse. We could've been on the menu. Heh-heh. Come on, Scooby-Doo. If we can't eat, at least we can go on some rides, ha-ha-ha, right? Right. I have to say, this is some amusement park. Thanks. We each took a section and designed it ourselves. There's my Brimstone Barbeque, the hottest ride in the park. Like, that was well done. Yeah, and so are we. And my Electric Alley. This ride gets my volt. It's shocking. Don't forget my Whirling Wildcats. And my Dynasty Star Ferris Wheel. Whoo! A great place to view with KISS binoculars, only $24.99. - What's that ride? - That's our most wicked ride of all... ...the Destroyer. But it's closed to the public. The Crimson Witch scared a couple of repairmen on it tonight. It looks pretty terrifying. Not if you were with me, darling. - Brother. - Fred. I'm sorry, Velma, but I can't compete with Starchild. You don't need to. Remember, underneath all that makeup is just a regular guy... ...who puts his pants on like everyone else. KISS costume change, activate. Come on. Relax, Fred. I think this was all pre-planned. You're right. It was a dress rehearsal for tonight's show. - Good test run, fellas. - This isn't getting us anywhere. We need to be doing our own investigation. All right, Demon, I hear you. Hey, guys, we're gonna take a break. Hi, I'm Shandi Strutter. KISS'S head techie. - Hi, I'm Velma, and this is Fred and Daphne. - Nice to meet you. So you're responsible for the band's stage effects? Most of them, yeah. The guys like to put on a show. You don't have to tell me. - Heh-heh. - Daphne's a fan. Um, KISS doesn't have fans, Freddie. They're called the KISS Army. I prefer the Ascot Five, myself. - Do they have an army? - It's more of an all-volunteer... ...international organization of enthusiastic youths. - Cool. - As in lame. Good deal finding that ice cream stand, Scoob. We'll have this case licked in no time. Ha-ha-ha. Yeah. Licked. Dude, maybe we should investigate the Rockin' Flume. "Your tongue must be this long to ride this ride." Hey- Looks like your tongue's long enough to get us both on this ride. Heh-heh. It's like the perfect park day. No lines, no operators. Aah! Pyew. Like, what died in here? Give me rock! Scoob, look, it's KISS! Whoa! KISS is super buff. You'll never stop me. We heard the commotion. Are you guys okay? Hey, man, heh-heh... ...did anyone catch the license plate number on that witch? Poor Scooby and Shaggy. They're still out. Pardon me, Chip McGhoo, KISS road manager, executive officer of merchandise. These KISS smelling salts work twice as fast and they're only $15.95. They're still not coming around. - Sorry. No refunds. - I think I might have the solution. Try this churro I grabbed from the concession stand. Aah! - Hey, man. - Hi, Shaggy. How do you feel? I feel like a couple more churros. How about you, Scooby-Doo? Yeah. And doughnuts too. How about some KISS Kakes? Now with Spaceman sprinkles. - What happened? - Well, first we got some ice cream... ...which Scooby-Doo licked away from me. Yummy, yummy, yummy. Then there was this smell and the stinky witch... ...and all this running and music and spinning and then... And then... Like, they saved us. KISS and their super powers. That's right, KISS has super powers. Sounds like they spun around one two many times in those drums. No. Like, he shot eye beams, he grew claws... ...he did lightning bolts, and he flew in and blew the biggest fire ever. Thank you, Mr. Demon. Beat it, mutt, before you dent my armor. Yes, sir. Of course, sir. - Shaggy, you're imagining things. - He didn't imagine the witch, that's for sure. What should we do now? You must leave! Trust me, KISS, these children are nothing but trouble. You think they're allies, but in the end... ...the only person they'll help is the Crimson Witch... ...in her plans to bring total devastation to this world. They must go now or all is lost. Guys, you've gotta stop doing this. If you wanna speak further, you know where to find me. - Who was that? - Chikara, the psychic. - She works at the park. - She tells people's fortunes. Well, she smells like a mixture of patchouli and hobo. She's actually very wise. - Maybe someone should talk to her. - I'll go. Mind if I tag along? I find it odd that she thinks she knows so much about the witch. Some of us should go back to the drum ride and try to pick up the witch's trail. I'll go with you, if you want. I want. I'll go too. Demon, Catman, keep an eye on Scooby and Shaggy. I got better things to do than babysit dogs and hippies. Hey, have fun. These confetti bombs just aren't getting any cheaper. There. I got some residue from the witch's mist. Heh, that's nice, Fred. Say, could you take a picture of me and Starchild looking for clues? Is this really necessary? He's a rock star, Fred. A rock star. - Just do it. - All right. And a couple more for safety. Thank you so much. - My pleasure. - Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Fred. Your thumb was in the way. On all of them. Gosh. Heh. I'm sorry. Are you doing this on purpose? No. I just don't see what the big deal is. We've solved over a thousand mysteries together... ...and you've never once asked to have a picture taken with me. No worries. I got one of the both of you. In vibrant, colorful acrylic. - You just painted our portrait? - Sure. - Just now? - No big deal. Just something I do in my spare time. Oops. Well, look, my thumb got in the way. But you painted it. Luckily I did a couple more for safety. Aah! It's beautiful. I think I liked your thumb better. We should take some more pictures of the scene itself. No need. One scan with my special eye will tell us all we'll need to know. It puts the X in x-ray. Oof. My nephew had a special eye. A pink one we called conjunctivitis. There's definitely a supernatural presence at work here. Hey, guys, wait. Listen. Not bad, but I am not into tap dancing. I am purely into rock 'n' roll! Whoa, yeah! Okay. Well, one side sounds solid. And the other hollow. As if it's some sort of trapdoor. Exactly. It looks like one of the doors to the catacombs. The what-a-combs? The catacombs are what we call the maze of hallways that run under the park. They give us access to any area, including the main stage. I'll bet this is how the witch disappeared. Sounds dangerous. - Stay back, Frank. - It's Fred. I'll go first to make sure it's safe. I hope he's all right. For Pete's sake. What are you doing? It's not like this is the first time I've ever climbed into a... Aah! Oof! I'd watch that last step. It's a doozy. Chikara, we need to talk. Spaceman, I sensed your approach. - You mean you heard the wind chimes? - Hmph. Why do you bring this one with you? Starchild seems to think they're okay. Plus, they've got a talking dog, which is kind of wild. Starchild cannot see as deep as I can. He has but one special eye, whereas I have two. Some people say I have four. I know you think this is a joke, Miss Smarty-Pants... ...but your ignorance will cost us all. Okay, then, I'm game. Tell us what we need to know. How serious is the threat? The danger grows, Spaceman. The Crimson Witch senses the rock of Kissteria is near. Rock of Kissteria? What's that? It's the key to holding evil at bay. This began on a Halloween night on another world... ...in a cosmic realm known as Kissteria. An evil Sorceress, called the Crimson Witch... ...created a gigantic horror known as the Destroyer. She sent the Destroyer to spread devastation throughout the land... ...the first step toward infecting the entire realm with evil. Destroy! But the warriors had a weapon. Cosmic power crystals. The Kissteria crystals. Each crystal sounded a musical note. The warriors used the music of the crystals to force the Destroyer to retreat... ...and once the monster was back inside its volcanic temple... No! They transferred the musical energy of the crystals... ...into a single, powerful... ...rock. That rock, the rock of Kissteria, became the key. By removing it, the Destroyer would be trapped forever. Naturally, the Crimson Witch has been desperate to retrieve it... ...especially by Halloween night... ...when circumstances are ripe to release the Destroyer. Where's the rock now? It's had many protectors over the ages. Each one a descendant of the musical warriors who fought so bravely. Today these guardians are known as KISS. You guys have it? Yep. We used to display it at the Hall of KISStory in the park. But when it gets near Halloween, we keep it with us on tour. Wait a second. Is this the rock? The Detroit Rock that you received as a gift from the city of Detroit? That's just a cover story. Yeah. And isn't the Destroyer just the name of a ride? Blasphemous! Have you learned nothing? The Destroyer will strike fear into your heart. I know. That's what the poster says. Aah! Get her away from me. She and her friends will do more harm than good. That woman is crazy. But her powers are impressive. You actually believe all that? Chikara's never wrong. Except that time she predicted the Love Gun album would go gold. Because it went platinum! Yeah, baby. Starchild! Starchild! I hope nothing's happened to him. What was that? Of all the times to be without my flashlight. - Aah! - You wanna buy a KISS flashlight? Comes with a handy key ring. What are you doing down here? Hey, I was just checking on the props of the concert, and I got lost in this maze. There it is again. f I only stocked up on KISS batteries. Hang on. I can use my cell phone. Those are the props I've been looking for. KISS monster props, part of the Halloween show. House seats still available. - That doesn't sound like a prop. - This way. You're leaving? Hello? Manager in the dark. Hello? In here. I got it. Ungh! Freddie! What is this place? It's my special effects lab. I thought I told you guys to stay back. Some of us had other ideas. Don't worry, Fred. We can dry you off. Beth? Christine? Okay. All right. That's good. Thank you. I take it you didn't find the witch. I searched this whole sector except for the chem lab. - That's why I came to Shandi. - I'm the only one who has the key. For the last few months, chemicals have gone missing, so I keep the lab under lock and key. No one gets in without coming to me first. See? Empty. Hey, is that a chemical analyzer? Pretty smart of you, Fred. I've got a couple at home. Hey, do you think you can analyze this? It's the residue from the witch's mist. Sure. Anything for a fellow chemmy. I don't think I've worked this hard in, like, ho-ho, forever. Me neither. Hey, Mr. Catman, when do we get to eat? After you've brought the KISS monsters on-stage. Monsters? Yeah, Chip brought them over. They're below us. - Like, where are the stairs, man? - Don't need them. That must be them, Scoob. Now, these are the kind of monsters I like. Fake ones. Shaggy, look. It's KISS'S green room where they hang out before the show. Scoob, you hit the jackpot. Think of all impressive people who have been invited down here. The pizza-delivery guy, the sandwich-delivery guy... ...the creepy witch, the sushi-delivery guy... Give me rock! Zoinks! Creepy witch. Like, maybe she'll think this is the real KISS and go away. Alive! Please go away. Please go away. Please go away. Are they gone? Maybe they're waiting for us to let our guard down. Well, they're gonna have to wait a long time. Shaggy? Scooby? Are you in there? Like, how do they know our names? - Shaggy. - Velma? Why are you not being eaten by KISS monsters? - KISS monsters? - What are you talking about? They're gone. I can't say we don't have enough suspects. The problem is finding a motive. The only one who'd like the park to shut down is Chip. - But he doesn't seem smart enough. - Shandi's smart enough. I know, but she's way too cute to be a suspect. Mr. Goldman and the security lady don't want the park to close. They'll lose their jobs. Chikara is the one who's the most obsessed with the witch. She talks as if she is really supernatural. - She's not? - No, Shaggy, she's not. No matter what you think you've seen, there has to be a rational explanation. It all centers on that rock. The so-called rock of Kissteria, which seems to be KISS'S Detroit Rock. You mean the one they sing about in that song "Detroit Rock City"? I always thought that stood for rock 'n' roll. I never thought of that. I guess that works too. Did you figure anything out? Not yet. But if we had that rock, we might be able to set a trap. Then maybe it's time we hand it over to you, darling. I do not like this. It's going to be fine. How do you know? (Dy-. Come on, if we don't stop the witch tonight, the park will go under. So let's rock these kids already. All right. Jinkies, it's a black diamond. The largest in the world. That explains why the Crimson Witch has turned this place upside down looking for it. Now it's just a matter of setting a trap. Yeah, so, like, who's gonna be the bait? You are. Scoob, how is it that out of four ginormous superheroes... ...you and I have to do the hard part? Just lucky I guess. Come on, you can do it. Yeah, we can't lure her out. Put yourself in our shoes. You know what? That might just help. Dude, I figure the bigger the shoes, the faster we'll run. Heh-heh. Good idea, Shaggy. Just make sure the witch sees the rock. Fred? Daphne? You in position? Roger that. Just make sure you bring her our way. Okay, then, you two, start walking. Not a problem. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! Ho-ho. Problem. Come on, guys, we have to get this mystery wrapped up before the concert starts. How does KISS walk in these things? We want KISS! We want KISS! I thought the concert was off. It's on again. KISS thinks they can nab the witch before it starts. Nice that someone tells me. I only happen to be in charge of backstage security. Better be ready for anything, Delilah. Those fans are gonna get the best Halloween concert... ...that 150 bucks can buy. Didn't KISS tell you? They're performing for free. Free? My heart! And how about this? They're even giving away T-shirts. Where is my KISS defibrillator? Rock of Kissteria! Get your rock of Kissteria here! Rare object of cosmic origin! Dude, you been eating beef jerky again? No, not this time. Then she's here. Aah! You gotta get her closer to us. Man, these boots were a terrible idea. Give me rock! - It's mine. - Now. Okay, let's see who this fake witch really is. I don't remember her on the suspect list. Agh! Fools. The Destroyer will feast on your fear. There she is. Ding-dong, the witch is down. Scratch that. Here, Shaggy- Thanks. Like, somebody help us! Whoa! - Jeepers. - What just happened? The Crimson Witch ripped a hole in the universe. Activate the Dynasty Star Portal. You mean the Ferris wheel? It's actually a portal to the cosmic realm of Kissteria. Of course it is. Does she have to come? Does your eye see the future? Then let's rip this open. Ooh, yeah Tonight I wanna give it all to you In the darkness There's so much I wanna do And tonight I wanna lay it at your feet 'Cause, girl, I was made for you And, girl, you were made for me I was made for loving you, baby You were made for loving me And I can't get enough of you, baby Can you get enough of me? Tonight I wanna see it in your eyes Feel the magic Something that drives me wild And tonight We're gonna make it all come true 'Cause, girl, you were made for me And, girl, I was made for you I was made for loving you, baby You were made for loving me And I can't get enough of you, baby Can you get enough of me? I was made for loving you, baby You were made for loving me And I can give it all to you, baby Can you give it all to me? Whoa, I have rock! Whoa. Where are we? It's like KISS World but weirder, if that's possible. Seems like more special effects to me. I don't know. It looks pretty real. I'm afraid. Come on, Daphne, we're still in the theme park. We've seen stranger things. Come, Scooby gang, we must seek the Elder. No, these guys take the cake of strangeness. Happy feet again, Scoob. Ew. It doesn't smell happy to me. Where is everyone? That must be her. The Elder. She's certainly not the Younger. A shadow has fallen across Kissteria and your arrival here only confirms the worst. The Crimson Witch has the rock. I'm afraid so. We lost her in the portal. Then we have little time to act. Who are they? Earth kids. Are they worthy? Their hearts are pure, their spirits strong. - And their stomachs empty. - Yeah, empty. Zip it. You children should prepare yourself. If the Crimson Witch succeeds in releasing the Destroyer... ...he will engulf your world in a torrent of darkness and evil. I'm ready, Your Majesty. Fred, is that makeup? It's a moon. - Whoa! Who hit you, buddy? - No one. - Looks like a black eye. - It's not. Nice shiner. It's a moon. Please, you seem like a nice boy. Go stand with your friends. Fred, are you trying to impress me? No. It's just that, well, you've been hanging all over Starface. - Have not. - Have so. - Have not. - Have so. - Have not. - Guys, guys. You've gotta stop this. If we're ever going to finish this cosmic boondoggle... ...and get back to solving the real mystery, we need to act like a team. All of us. Even these weirdos. The sarcastic girl speaks the truth. Only together will you have the power and skills needed to defeat the Destroyer. Starchild, do you mind if I ask where you get your super powers from? Rock 'n' roll. It powers everything in Kissteria. I don't know. Maybe I can find friends with normal interests. Be careful with that bass. Because it's made from alien technology? Because it costs more than your house. Excuse me, Mr. Demon, is it rock 'n' roll... ...that makes you breathe fire? - No. - Then what does? Tamales? - No. - Hot peppers? - No. - Chimichanga sauce? - No. You might as well tell them, Demon, before we get another grocery list. The secret to breathing fire is to swallow your fears. - Fears? - Like, I didn't know you could eat those. Swallow them up, hold them inside... ...and force them out as demon fire. Talk about your acid reflux. There it is, the tomb of the Destroyer. And there's the witch. You shouldn't have brought them here, KISS. They will surely never leave Kissteria... ...alive! I'll go after her myself. You guys stay and protect the kids. Great, more babysitting. This is one heck of a theme-park attraction. No. Dead end. Like, have you been swallowing your fears, Scooby-Doo? Yeah. Lots of them. Good, then let them rip. Well done, pathetic scum. Thanks, Mr. Demon. We think? - Yeah. - Yeah. It's over, Crimson Witch. I'll be taking back the rock of Kissteria. Rock, Starchild? Why settle for the rock, when you can have the whole mountain? Arise, Destroyer! Yo, witchy-poo. I'm not done yet. Such arrogance. You can't defeat me alone. Just watch me. Yes! Dude, I hope that's my stomach rumbling. No, look. You're too late. Ha-ha-ha! I go now to watch the destruction of your beloved Earth. Farewell, fools. Nice work stopping the witch. I couldn't beat her on my own. You know, the Elder said that the only way to stop whatever's happening here... ...is with teamwork, right? - Right. - Really? Yeah. As much as I hate to admit it, we need to work together. Hey, Starchild said that rock 'n' roll powers everything here. And it was music that created the rock of Kissteria in the first place. So if we create massive music... Our kind of music... We'll overload the Destroyer. Yeah. You guys just need to make too much rock 'n' roll. Too much rock 'n' roll? Ain't no such thing. Look, you're KISS. If anyone can make too much rock 'n' roll, it's you. Then we'll head back to KISS World and start the concert... ...while you guys distract the Destroyer. How will we do that? With this. Wow, neat. We call it the KISS Kraft. We have a van that we call the Mystery Machine. That's cool, Frank, but we're running out of time. It's Fred. Quick, get in the KISS car. KISS Kraft. Come on. WhoopsY! You really need to lay off the Scooby Snacks. Grr. Like, how did I get out here? Yes. Freedom is mine! We want KISS! We want KISS! We want KISS! We want KISS! We want KISS! We want KISS! I know the fans want to get in, but I haven't heard from KISS yet. - Where are they...? - We're here, Goldman. Open the gates and let the army in. We need to rock 'n' roll. Ha-ha-ha. Yes. Free at last. Free to destroy. Free to swallow the Earth in evil. Not so fast, Destroyer. Out of my way, insolent flea. Whoa, he is really big. Make us, bucket head. All right, KISS World! You wanted the best, and you got it. The hottest band in the world... ...KISS! I hate music! I feel uptight on Saturday night Nine 0' clock, the radio's the only light I hear my song and it pulls me through Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do I got to - Get up - Everybody's gonna move their feet - Get down - Everybody's gonna leave their seat You gotta lose your mind In Detroit Rock City - Get up - Everybody's gonna move their feet - Get down - Everybody's gonna leave their seat Heads up. Moving fast, down 95 Like, step on it, Fred! Hit top speed But I'm still moving much too slow I feel so good, I'm so alive I hear my song playing on the radio And it goes - Get up - Everybody's gonna move their feet - Get down - Everybody's gonna leave their seat Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock Curse you, KISS! There's a truck ahead Lights staring at my eyes Aah! My God, no time to turn I got to laugh because I know I'm gonna die Why - Get up - Everybody's gonna move their feet - Get up - Everybody's gonna leave their seat Shaggy, Scooby, are you awake? I think they're coming around. Like, what happened? - Yeah, what happened? - You passed out. I guess at some point, we all passed out and woke up here. We just got a report on the residue. It seems our Crimson Witch is more of a chemical witch. Her witch haze is really a gas that messes with your senses and creates illusions. You mean to tell me... It was all a figment of our imaginations. Whoa, that's deep. Yeah, deep. But what about the Destroyer and the cosmic realm? Yeah, the cosmic realm. It never happened. We all had what you call a mass hallucination. Then who has the rock of Kissteria? Yeah, the rock of Kissteria. Dude, seriously? After everything I say? Sorry, Shaggy- The Crimson Witch has it, but not for long. We figured out where she stashed it. If there's room for you two in here, there's certainly room for a black diamond. Give me rock! Give me... Rock. We get it. Look, she hid gas dispensers in her cape. And here's the magnetic repulsor-field belt she used for flying. Ooh. Quest Research Laboratories. Good stuff. All stolen from her previous employer. Thanks, Starchild. KISS has been on witch watch ever since we passed out. So, like, who's the witch? I thought you'd have guessed when we opened her locker, Shaggy. She's Delilah Domino, the head of security. Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle. Delilah. I knew it. I didn't really know it, but, you know, I like to be smart. I'm the boss. - Curious. I didn't see that coming. - How did you know? When Delilah mentioned that she worked for a government defense company... ...we did some research. Turns out, they specialized in lasers. So? - Lasers that use black diamonds, guys. - She was hoping to steal it from here... ...and sell it to a competing defense company since she was fired from the last one. She was also the one stealing your chemicals, so she could make her witch gas. As head of security, she would've had another keycard to your lab. And while everyone was watching the concert, she hid the diamond here in her locker. My plan was perfect. And I would've gotten away with it too if it hadn't been for you meddling KISS. Er, kids. You meddling kids. Note to self: KISS handcuffs. Thanks for helping us keep the park open. And thank you for letting us solve the mystery with you. It was interesting. We couldn't have done it without you. Yeah, I guess you kids are okay after all. Thanks, Mr. Demon. You'll always be the only demon I'll ever like. Yeah. Thanks, Mr. Demon. My pleasure. And even though I'll always remain an Ascot Five man... ...we wound up being pretty great partners. Thanks, Scooby gang. You guys are welcome back to KISS World anytime. Until then, I leave you with a kiss. Heh. You know, I think she'd settle for a handshake or an autograph. Hello. Thank you. I mean, you're welcome. You could have cut that off a little earlier. it was kind of gross. I mean, I was right there. I was there. I'm sorry. Did you say something, Frank? Mwah. Do you know what was the best thing about this adventure? The fact that my philosophy remains intact. There is always a rational explanation. That is my undeniable, steadfast and kind of boring philosophy. Hold on, Scoob. Looks like I still have half a churro in my pocket. It's cold. Nice and toasty. Thanks again, guys. Now we gotta get this rock back to the Elder for safekeeping. - Did you seem? - Did you? You think we should tell her? No. Why rock her world? Good point. Yeah.
