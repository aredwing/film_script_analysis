Of course, I do, baby. Here's to having you to myself for the entire weekend. I'm all yours, Will. Every inch of me. Come Monday, you won't be able to walk straight. I like the sound of that. Yeah, I mean... - What was that? - I have a conscience. - It was nothing, baby. - Come on. Shh! You just left the TV on. I wasn't watching TV. Oh. No. No, come on, don't go. What if it's your husband? No way. He's in Tokyo till Thursday. Will, it's nothing. Shit! If it is him... - Yeah? - We could always say it was dark. And we thought it was an intruder. An honest mistake, self-defense, you know? Yeah. Come on. Our sex tape can't be blur. No, we don't wanna leave this blurry. - Come on... - I need to see you. I need to see everything. See. Told you. Well, I didn't turn it on. Yeah, right. Perv. - You're pinning me down! - Oh! Oh! Naughty little schoolgirl. I need this too much. Okay, what the hell is going on? Somebody's fucking with us. Hello? It's just some asshole kids. I don't know. You know, my friends and I used to always pull this crap on Mischief Night. - Didn't you? - What the hell is Mischief Night? There they are. Cue the bag of flaming poo. Very funny, ass... What's going on? I don't know. But I'm not taking any chances. I'm calling the cops. - Shit. - What? No dial tone. There's someone there. - Where's your cell phone? - In my purse. Find it. - Find it? - No. I swear, it was right there! - Where's yours? - Jeans. - Not here. - Let me look. Who the hell is it? Whoever it is, they may still be in the house. You go hide in the closet while I check it out. If somebody's messing with us, they'll be sorry. No. Be careful. All right. Go. Batter's up, assholes. Hello? All right! Who wants to get their asses kicked? Huh? Pussies. Oh, no. Come on! Come on! No! No! Come on! Come on! Oh, my God. Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God. No! No! Come on! Come on! Oh, fuck! Let me out of here! So, how is school? Fine. A little boring. Staying out of trouble then? No, no. Uh, let's see. I've been suspended twice in the last week, I'm failing everything, getting kicked out of all the clubs. There's this one kid's mom that's threatening to press charges against me. Good, good! Glad to hear it. I... I'm glad to see that everything is on track then, huh? But seriously, it is. I mean, I'm... I'm doing really well, Dr. Pomock. Like, it might be time for me to lose the Lexapro. Emily... Look, I... I know what you're going to say. You're gonna tell me that the medication makes me feel better, and that's why I don't think I need it anymore, even though I still do. But in that case... When do you get to stop taking the medication? Yeah. How about when your eyesight returns? Well, that's a cheap shot. I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to be. Emily, why is it that you can't see? Because something happened in the accident. Some weird, like, nerve trauma, some brain trauma, or... Or emotional trauma? Causing conversion disorder, of which your asthma and your blindness are active symptoms. Yeah, but maybe that's not the case. And maybe the neurologists and the ophthalmologists and the radiologists are... All missed something. Yes. I mean, I'm happy. I'm well-adjusted, I'm smart, I have a boyfriend, my dad and I are super close. It's been nine years. I... Shouldn't I be cured by now? If... If this was all in my head, wouldn't I be able to see? Maybe it's you. Maybe you're just doing a lousy job. I see. Well, now who's taking the cheap shots? You know what I mean, this whole process. You know, maybe this is something that we need to spend more time actually talking about. You know, really coming to terms with the idea that you may never regain your eyesight. Well... How would you feel about that? I mean, if... If this, what you are seeing right now, is all you would ever see of the world? Is that okay? Does it make you angry? Would you blame somebody, or... I asked if you'd... If you'd blame someone. Yeah. I'd blame myself. It's my fault. She was injured and bleeding and asking for help. And I... I just... Emily, you were eight years old. They found you in the snow nearly frozen to death. You were going for help, you said. Maybe. Maybe I was, maybe I wasn't, who remembers? And the accident itself? What do you mean? Uh, was that your fault, too? I mean, it wasn't like you were actually driving the car, was it? Or... Don't. So, you don't remember what happened? No. Mmm-hmm. - Hey, kid! - Hey, Dad. How'd it go? Seatbelt. So, how did it... Not right now, okay? Oh! You all right? Are you all right, honey? I'm fine. What was that? It was a pothole. I'm sorry, it was my fault. You sure you're okay? Yeah. Yeah. I... I just hit my head. So you're good? Dad, please. So, you don't remember what happened? No. Mmm-hmm. Except, you do. It's all in the police report. So then you know, and you don't need me to tell you. No. But I need you to tell you. Why? Why does it matter? Because... Do you honestly blame yourself for your mother's death? I mean, are you really carrying that weight around with you? 'Cause I gotta say, if you are, it's a wonder you could stand, let alone see. Look, I don't wanna talk about this anymore. Well, you know, that's, uh, that's just catnip to someone in my profession, okay? That's probably the precise thing we should be talking about. We've been over this and over it. You asked why you're still on the medication, why you can't see, why you're still in therapy after nine years. Well? You have to tell me. Oh, for God's sake! No, that's the way that it works, kiddo, okay? You have the answer. Oh, well, then, what's the question? Why do you blame yourself for your mother's death? Because it was my fault! Jimmy calling. Jimmy calling. Jimmy calling. Hey, Jimmy. No, not yet. I... I will soon. Tonight. I'll ask him tonight. I... I promise. Oh. Me, too. So how's Jimmy? Oh, he's fine. You know, he's a pain. He's really excited because it's Mischief Night and he and his friends are going to prank some of the guys on the JV squad. I guess it's some annual tradition. Boys. Hey, it's what we do, right? Get tortured and then torture others in turn. So it goes, from one generation to the next. You did that too? Well, when we were kids, we called it "Cabbage Night," believe it or not. We actually threw rotten cabbages at each other. And the occasional car window. "Cabbage Night?" God, you were a nerd. It takes one to know one, huh? Want me to make you some dinner before I head out? Dad, I'm not 12, I can make my own dinner. Okay, okay, just asking. Well, what do you think? How do I look? - New sweater? - No. No. I... I just haven't worn it in a while. Yeah, but you're wearing your lucky shirt. Trying to get lucky tonight, eh? Eh? It's a first date, Em. I'll be lucky if it lasts an hour. Ah, you'll end up sleeping with her and spending the night, and I'll be on my own. You're gonna leave me alone all by myself in this horrifying house. We've only been here a few months, I don't even know my way around here yet. Listen to you! If it wasn't for your constant nagging, I wouldn't be going at all. Yeah, well, thank God for my constant nagging. The rate you're going, you'll end up watching the Hallmark Channel, eating frozen meals for one. I... I'm sorry, Dad. I was just kidding. No, I... I know, sweetheart. It's just... Dating is hard. At my age... And in my condition, if that's the right word for it? I'm still in love with your mom. I mean, she was the love of my life. I don't... It's been nine years. Life goes on, right? That's what my shrink said. Didn't yours? Yeah, he did. And it does. After all, you're a big girl now. With a life of her own. I should get a life too, right? Mmm. Exactly. And say, she said, spotting the perfect segue, I am a big girl, with a life of her own, so... So what? Well, you know Jimmy? Yeah, I know Jimmy. Well, you know his dad has that cabin up near Mount Arthur? And? And... He invited me to go up for the weekend with him and his family and he's going to teach me how to ski. - He's gonna what? - Teach me how to ski. You know, that thing where people put sticks on their feet - and roll down mountains? - Oh, no. Oh, honey, come on now. You know, I wanna say that's a bad idea. - Why? - Well, because... - What, because I'm blind? - No, don't be ridiculous. We both know blind people do anything and... - Well, then why not? - Well, because... Because of Jimmy? He is an idiot. Well, duh, he's an 18-year-old boy. They're all idiots. So? Can I go? I'll be worried about you, Em. - I'm a big girl. - No, I don't care. Look, plenty of people with perfect vision go skiing every year and break their necks. Even 17-year-olds, Miss Emily. Now, what if you hurt yourself? I won't hurt myself. I'm gonna take a lesson. Start out slow. And if I'm good enough, I'll go down the easy slope with Jimmy guiding me the whole way. Jimmy? The idiot? Right. He's been skiing since he was five. Never broke a thing. Including a book. I promise, I can handle myself. Hey, Sharon. Yeah. I... I remember, it's right behind the red house. I'm... I'm looking forward to it, too. Okay. Bye. She can't wait to see you. Apparently. Cool. And? So? Fine. But please, come back in one piece, please. You too, lover boy. I am gonna change. Yeah. Good idea. Emily? Emily? What happened? I don't know. Oh, great. Great. They're egging the house. Right, Mischief Night. Okay, good. Calm down, Dad, it's just some kids messing around. Son of a bitch! - Hey! - Oh, man! Hey! Assholes. Why the hell would they hit this house? You okay? I gotta clean that before it dries. Shh! You thought you could sneak up on me. How the hell did you know? Because you smell like someone who's been playing football for two hours. You know what I think? I don't think you're really blind at all. I think you've been lying this whole time. That or you're Daredevil. I wish I could see you. Trust me, you don't. I'm hideously ugly, so... So are you ever gonna finish unpacking? Or, like, I don't know, like decorate a little? Decorate? You mean, like, hang posters? Okay, when you say it like that it sounds... Wait a minute. Did you color your hair? Oh, Jesus, you can feel that? Yes. Yeah, me and the guys went yesterday. God, maybe you are Daredevil. Maybe. But I prefer Batman. Or the Hulk. Smash. I don't... I don't get it. I mean, your eyes are so beautiful, it... It just doesn't make sense. Well, the doctor says that there's nothing actually wrong with my eyes and my vision could come back at any time. And what do you think? I think that I'm tired of talking about the subject for one day. Anyways, guess what? What? Who has four thumbs and are totally going to your parents' cabin this weekend? - Wait, no kidding? No... - Mmm-hmm. No kidding. Yes! I am getting some skis on. Oh! Emily? - Oh, shit. - Em? Emily? Emily? Emily? Hey, Em? Oh, hey Dad. I just wanted to tell you I'm taking off. Okay, have fun. I'm gonna lock up as I leave, so, the key is in the spot. And what else? What? Oh, I have the cell phone, so if you need me, call me. Dad. Dad, I'll be fine. Just go. - Yeah? - Yep. - Okay. I'm going. - Have... Have fun. Oh, shit! Come on. Hello? Dad? Who's there? Find something better to do with your time, loser! What would you like to do? Call Dad. Dialing. Hey, it's David. Please leave a message. Hey, Dad. Um, everything's fine. I was just making sure you were having a good time. Uh, no need to call me back. Love you. What would you like to do? - Call Jimmy. - Dialing. - Hello? - Jimmy. Hey, babe. Uh, you miss me already? What are you doing? Oh, I'm... I'm just, uh, I'm hanging with... Uh, we're about to go prk some of the freshmen, so. You okay? Yeah. Everything's fine. I was... It's just, some kids are messing around around the house. Do you need me to come over and kick somebody's ass? Yes. But seriously... Um, I just got scared for a minute. Look, babe, it's... It's Mischief Night, you know? It's bound to happen, okay? Um, I mean God knows I've terrorized some folks in my time. I mean, TPing houses, egging people. I mean... I even took... I even took a dump in Aidan's front lawn. Do you remember Aidan? Yeah, you two were best friends for a while. Yeah, not after that. I don't know, I don't know. People really hold a grudge. Yeah, all right. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna take a nice hot shower and get in bed. Nice hot shower, huh? Uh, you, uh, you got room for me in there? Sure. Then my dad's gonna come home and shoot you. Yeah, well, it might be worth dying for. Mmm, dream on. All right, bye. Okay. It's just some dumb kids. That's all. Just some dumb kids, and you're not gonna let them freak you out, okay? How do you expect to go skiing if you can't even handle some kids throwing eggs? You can't. So quit it. - I can take care of those tw. - I don't know. I don't know! I know you're afraid, but we... I don't know! I don't know! What's happening? Lauren calling. Lauren calling. Lauren calling. Lauren calling. Lauren calling. Lauren... Hey! Hey Em, how you doing? - I'm good. - Uh, is my brother on his date? Amazingly. You know what that is. That is, uh, one giant leap for mankind, right there. He should've done this a long time ago. Mmm. Yep. So, listen, I'm... I'm gonna stop by. Okay, what's up? Uh, well, you know that costume you wore in first grade? - Uh, the rag doll? - Mmm-hmm? Wouldn't Caroline look adorable in that? I, uh, mentioned it to her and she wants to wear it. You know, so she can be like her big cousin, Em. Aw, that sounds sweet. I'll see if I can find it. All right, and I'll stop by in about 15 minutes to help you look. - Okay. See you soon. - Bye-bye, honey. Ouch! Emily? Emily? Emily! Found it! Oh, my gosh! Didn't you hear me calling you? All right, you almost gave me half a heart attack. Well, it's Mischief Night, auntie, dear. I'm supposed to scare you to death. Well, you did. Oh, my God. This is more adorable than I even remember. - Thanks so much for finding it for me. - Oh, you're welcome. So, tell me. Your dad is on his first date since the Cretaceous Period. - Yeah. - And who is the lucky lady? - Well, her name is Miss Sharon Balkin. - Ah. She was my old math teacher. I set it up. Ah. - Nice job! - Thank you. Did she pick him up? I saw his car. - Um, I guess so. - Mmm. Oh, and I was gonna ask you, um, what about that weekend at Jimmy's cabin? Oh, yeah, I got the nod. - You did? - Mmm-hmm. - I knew he would cave! - I know. - You are working it, girl. You are working it. - Thank you. I am so excited. Oh, well, I want to thank you so much for getting this - for me and Carol. - Oh, sure. Tell her... Tell Carol I love her. I will. We love you, too, sweetheart. - Love you two more! - All right, I gotta go. - Okay. - Bye-bye. Bye! Oh. Oh, Emily. I forgot. Emily? Make sure you don't leave the door open. Your father will kill... Lauren? Did you say the door was open? Lauren, did you leave? Lauren? Hello? Lauren? Lauren? Lauren. Oh. Okay. Good. Lauren, you leave? Uh, I'm calling you just to be sure. What the... Just calm down. You're okay. There's... There's an explanation for this. The phone's somewhere. Just think. Okay. Okay. What were you doing? Coffee table. Hello? - Lauren calling. - Geez. Lauren calling. Lauren calling. Lauren calling. Lauren... Hello? Lauren? Hello? Get away from me! Just get away! What... What do you want? You want to scare me? 'Cause I'm scared, okay? Just get away from me! Get away from me! Get away from me, please! Just get away, please! Just get away from me! Shit. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, just breathe. Just breathe, just breathe, just breathe. - You miss me that much? - Oh, Jimmy. Thank God! Hey, what's wrong? Hey. Hey, what's wrong? There's... There's someone here. - What do you mean? - There's someone in the house right now. What? Are you sure? Yeah! I could... I could hear him. I could hear him breathing. Hey, hey. It's just nerves. No, it's not! No, it's not! You have to listen to me. I know where I left my phone and it's... It's not there anymore. Somebody moved it. You have to believe me! Okay. Hey, hey, hey! Okay, okay, okay, I do. I do. I believe you. All right? But I need you to breathe for me, all right? Calm down and breathe. Shh. It's okay. Wait, Lauren was here. I... I swear I never heard her car leave. Are you sure? I never heard her car leave. Where's your cell phone? We have to call the police. I can't. It's dead. Damn it. I... I tried the landline. But there's... There's no dial tone. That's weird. Where's your cell? I don't know, I dropped it and I think it broke. We have to get out of here. I can't be here. Don't leave me. - Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey. Hey! - I wanna leave right now. - I need you to calm down. - I'll calm down when we get out of here! All right. We'll go. Okay? But wait. What if he's out there? I don't... I don't know what to do. Uh... All right, look. Here's what we're gonna do, okay? Let me borrow this knife. All right, I'll borrow your knife. I'll go out first, I'll check to see if the coast is clear and then we'll go. All right? But I need you to take a couple of deep breaths for me first, Em, okay? There you go. There you go. Okay. Wait, don't leave me here. All right, we'll go together. All right? Hey, everything's gonna be fine, okay? I promise. Cool. What's the deal in here? My dad doesn't like me coming in here. This is where he keeps my mom's stuff. Wow. She's pretty. Uh, is this your mom? Just leave it. Just leave it. Let's just leave everything. I don't think anybody's in here anyway. There's blood here, Emily. And there's glass everywhere. Oh, it's me. I... I cut my foot. The smoke detector went off. - And I knocked... - Whoa, Emily, come here, let me see. This is a pretty nasty cut, Em. Look, we're gonna have to put something on that, okay? Just wait here a second, all right? I'm gonna go get some gauze and tape. No, no, no. Don't leave me here. Hey, I'll be right back, all right? I'm telling you, Jimmy, there's something wrong in here. Hey. I'm gonna fix your foot up and then we're gonna go, okay? Jimmy, did you find it? Jimmy? Jimmy? Jimmy, this isn't funny! There you are. - What are you doing? - Shh. Jimmy? No! What would you like to do? Police. Did you say, "Call Dad"? - Call police. - Home or cell? Call 911. Did you say, "Call Dad"? Okay, call Dad. Call Dad. Come on! Come on, come on! Please work! Please! Come on! Call Dad! Damn it! Incoming call. Incoming.. - Hello? - Hello, Emily? Can you hear me? - There's a bad connection. - Sharon? Sharon, can you hear me? - I hope you can hear m. - Sharon, can you hear me? I need help. - Please, please hear me! - Uh... He didn't show up for our date tonight, so I figured something must be wrong. I don't think he'd stand me up without calling. - Yeah, I tried his phone. - What do you mean he didn't show up? And it goes straigt to voicemail. So I don't know if you're hearing this, but please do me a favr and call me later. Um, thanks. Bye. Call Dad. - Did you say, "Call Dad? - Yes. Dad. - Home or cell? - Cell. - Sorry I did not get that. Did you say "home" or "cell"? - Cell! Dialing. What would you like to do? Call Dad. - Home or cell? - Cell. Dialing. Hey, it's David. Please leave a message. Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad? Daddy? Oh! Oh, my God. Thank God! Emily, you're all right. Can you get my hands? He's taped my hands. Can you get that and use that? Oh! Thank God! Oh, my God! Thank God you're all right. Oh! Dad. There's someone in the house. He's still... He hit me as I was leaving. And he... God! He knocked me out! - Who would do this? - I don't know, but we gotta get out of here. He's still here. Come on. Easy, easy. Wait here. - What's happening? - He's just outside. Come on. Are you okay? What happened? I think I hit him. Are you sure? Stay here. It's okay, come on. We're getting out of here. Is he dead? I don't know, but I definitely got him. I think he ran out. Come on. Easy. Is he gone? I think so. Is Lauren here? Well, she was, like, an hour ago. - Her car is still out front. - What? Damn it! They got my phone and my keys. Yeah, they cut the landline too. What about your cell? Come on. Damn it, it's dead! All right, listen to me. Listen to me, Emily. I need to go out there and see if your aunt's okay. I want you to stay here and lock the door behind me. - No! - I'll be right back. No, this is a bad idea. Let me come with you. Honey, it'll be much faster if I run out there and come right back, okay? Please? Promise me you'll come back. I promise. Lock up behind me now. Lauren! Dad, what's going on? Lauren! Lauren! Dad! Emily, it's me. What happened? Lauren's car. What about it? - Somebody drove off in it. - Oh, my God! - No, no, no, he's gone, honey. He's gone. - But where's Lauren? - I... I don't know. - Well, what are we going to do? Look, we gotta get some help. We... We could run to the Garson's, they're probably home. Well, maybe, but I don't want to take you out there until I know it's safe. Well, I don't want to stay here! Oh, God! Dad! What do you want? You want money, is that it? Stay here. No! No! No! No! No! Run, Emily, run! No, no! Dad! Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, Jimmy! Oh, Jimmy! Oh, my God! Jimmy! Oh! Oh! Lauren? Oh. No, I'll tell you what the problem is. The problem is, you got a guy in the White House who thinks the Constitution... Holy crap! Who cares? Who cares? Fourth Amendment? Trample all over it. Easy. - Please, you have to help me! Please! - What are you doing? No, there's somebody... There's... Somebody's trying to kill us! Where? Wait, let's get you out of here! - Come on! - No, no, wait. Wait. No, no, no, no! My... My daddy's still inside! Please, you have to help me! That's... That's okay. I have a radio in the truck. We'll call the police. Just get inside. Holy crap! Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Hello, is anybody there? Please, please! I need help! Please, hear me! Please, please, please, is anybody there? Uh, hey, could you... Could you repeat your message? I... I need help! There's somebody... He... He broke into my house and he's trying to kill us! Is this for real? Who am I talking to? Yes! My... My name is Emily Walton. And I'm calling from a truck outside of my house. Somebody's trying to kill us. Please, please, we need help. Girl, if you're messing around on Mischief Night, it's not funny. No, I'm not. I swear. I swear. Just, please. Please, sir, please. I need your help. What do you want me to do? Just call the police. Call the police and tell them... What's going on? Please, just call the police and... And tell them to come to 516 Dunn Lane. You're breaking up, can you repeat that? 516 Dunn Lane, please hurry! Honey, it's me. It's me. It's okay. It's me. He... He's right behind me! We have to get back in the house! Who? I don't see anyone. He was... He was right behind me. There was this truck driver that stopped for me, but they... They killed him! How many? I don't know. I think just one. And there's a truck up there? Yeah, maybe we can get away. Well, yeah, but... If the keys are still in it. But listen, we got to... We got to go back to the house. Listen, I'm out of bullets. And I don't want to go up there, in case anyone's up there, without bullets, all right? So we've got to go back to the house, all right? I'm going to hide you in the garage, and I'll only be a minute, and then we'll go get that truck, okay? I'd rather come with you. No, I think it's safer if you stay here. I'll be quick. But I need you to stay right here, all right? I love you, Daddy. And I love you too, honey. Ow! Oh! Come on in, you son of a bitch. Em... Help me. Sometimes things happen that are simply out of our control. Sometimes it isn't anybody's fault. You were in the backseat. Your mother was driving. What could you possibly have done to help? What could anyone have done to help? No! Em... You were in the backseat. Your mother was driving. She was texting. What was that? She was texting. She wasn't watching the road. And she slammed right into that truck. And she... She... She shouldn't have... She should've been watching. I love you. I'm sorry. Why? Why are you doing this? Say something. It's Mischief Night. Dad! Shh, shh, shh. It's me, it's me. You've got to find that gun, Emily. It's right by the front door. You've got to find it. I got him, Daddy. Oh! Oh, I love you. Oh, I love you. I love you. I love you.
