All right. Thanks for buying the platinum package! [ Chattering ] Excuse me. Hey. Hey. [ Kisses ] How are you? I'm good. Get a program? No, I didn't. I'll just look off yours. So that took a while.

A special welcome to our alumni and guests. Good to have you. We are proud of our spring production- one of our enduring traditions here at the university. This year, we are featuring some fresh new faces. So join me as we welcome to the stage our cast, as they perform an original play written by yours truly. [Applause ] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So without further ado, I present to you Annabella. Whoo-whoo! [Whistling ] - Annabella? - Is that you, Desmond? Hello, Annabella. You can dispense with the pleasantries, Desmond. It's a bit trifle, don't you think? If you'd just let me explain, I'm confident we would agree. You need to know that my family has, well, certain standards for me. Standards which I do not meet? [ Labored Breathing ] Admit it, Desmond. Please. [ Gasping ] - I've realized- - I've- I've realized that... I have certain standards that you do not meet. That's not right. It's time I set sail on my own. It's time I discovered the life I've always dreamed of but thought impossible. [Heartbeat] [ Muffled ] Get it together, Hannah. I'm leaving, Desmond. Leaving? Where, Annabella? [ Labored Breathing ] I'm- [ Groans ] [Whispers ] I want- [Wheezing ] Hannah! Excuse me. - [ Father] Hannah? - [Coughing ] - [Wheezing ] - Hannah? - Hannah! - [ Gasps ] [Voice Muffled, Echoing ] Get her inhaler.

[ No Audible Dialogue] [ Siren Wailing, Distant] [ Woman On P.A., /nd/stinct] Um, Dr. Jacob Lawson. Is he in surgery? [Typing 1 Thanks. Yeah. But what I'd like to do is maybe a few more tests. Just to make sure. Sure. [ Indistinct] Hi, sweetie. I was looking for you. They said you'd be here. What was that about? Does he- Does he know what happened? Uh- [ Chuckles ] No, no, no. The full test results won't be in for another couple days. But your P.E.F. levels were fine when you stayed here overnight. So Dr. Stewart thinks it's good for us all to go home. Is that not what you think? Yeah. N-No, I do. I agree. L- I agree with Dr. Stewart. He's a specialist. We need to do what he says. All right. Well, I'm gonna go get changed, I guess. Okay. [Bell Chiming] If you would just let me explain, I'm confident we would agree. You need to know that my family- they, well, have certain standards for me. [Woman ] Standards which I do not meet? Admit it, Desmond. Please. It's time I discovered the life I've always dreamed of but thought impossible. [ Phone Ringing 1 [Keys Jingling] Predictions? Is there something you're not telling me, Dad? I was thinking about asking you the same thing. [ Door Opens, Closes ] Jacob? Hi. Hey, Grace, Hannah. [ Softly ] Hi. It's good to see you all again. Although I wish it was under better circumstances So how have you felt this week? Any new symptoms or problems? No. I feel fine. Well, I've looked at your E.E.G. and M.R.l., and it looks as though we need to reconsider our current management of the epilepsy. Stress, sleep deprivation and alcohol can increase your risk of seizures. Since you haven't had a seizure since childhood, I just have to ask- L-L-Look. I don't do drugs. I don't drink. I don't smoke. I haven't- If that's what you mean. Oh. I see. B.P.D., acute asthma, seizures, multiple hip surgeries- most when you were too young to remember. I remember some. [ Clears Throat ] Hannah, I believe that everything you've suffered from... is related. Why am I sick? You were born very prematurely. Twenty-four weeks. Premature birth or low birth weight... and a traumatic delivery can be associated with this condition. I was premature, and that's why I'm sick. Hannah, we're concerned about you... because of the physical and emotional symptoms that you're having. What do you- What do you mean, um, emotional? Your father e-mailed me this. I feel dead inside. No. Something worse than death. I am still a child, a child trying to find a place in this world. I have so many unanswered questions, questions I feel but can't even begin to speak... because there are no words to express them. Something is missing. Why, God, do I feel- do I feel unwanted? Why do / feel / have no r/jght to exist? Why do I spend more time wanting to end my life than live it? You- You read my journal? Hannah, I believe that what you're feeling is normal, and is even expected. What is- What is this about? What? What? Hannah, we're not your biological parents. Hang on. That's, uh- That's not how I wanted to tell you. Why didn't you tell me I was adopted? [ Clears Throat ] Okay. Um- Hannah, you were born premature because you are the survivor of a failed abortion. [ Mouths Words ] Your physical and I believe your emotional symptoms... can be traced to this, as they have in other cases. I-I-I can only speak to your physical symptoms. But I'm suggesting that you begin treatment for your psychological symptoms as well. Immediately. Now, I'm prescribing a new medication to help control your seizures, and you have to continue to take your current medication. - Hannah. - Don't- I have to go. - Hey. I don't think that's a good idea. - Don't touch me. [ Rock Splashes ] [ Beeping 1 [Line Ringing] [Man] He//0? [ Chattering ] Hi. Hey. I can '1 hear you. [Man #2] I have set your /ron on fire. [Man #1 ] Can / call you back? Jason, the iron's on fire. No, it's too- It's in my hand. It's really loud in here. I'm sorry. Can I call you back? The iron's on fire. [ Scoffs ] Sure. That's fine. Whatever. Call me back. Bye. [ Sighs 1 [ Rock Splashes ] [ Rock Splashes ] - We didn't even talk about it before you sent the e-mail. - What am I supposed to do? I find out my daughter is contemplating suicide. Am I supposed to do nothing? - I don't think so. - It's not like that. Hannah, sweetheart. Please sit down. Uh- We need to talk to you. You've had 19 years to talk to me. I can understand why you would feel that way, but, please, I would like to talk to you now, so sit- I don't want to sit down. I don't want to talk about it. - Then what do you want? - I want to see my birth certificate. Why? Because I want to know who I am. I- This is who you are, Hannah. Okay. Well, I wanna know who my birth mother is. I wanna know how I can find her. - I can't do that. - Why? Because I can't. I can't- [ Sighs ] All right. I can't do that because I have no idea who your birth mother is. - I have no idea where she is, when she- - Here. It's your birth certificate. Thank you. [ Footsteps Depart] [ Door Closes ] [ Sighs ] [ Vehicle Approaches ] [ Engine Off] [ Door Opens ] Wh-Wh- Who's there? Hello? It's me. You can put down the pepper spray. Great. How did you know I was here? You are way too predictable. I am not. I am not. [ Sighs 1 Can I come in? No. I'm mad at you. What are you doing? I am taking off my shoes. Why are you taking off your shoes? Because... I'm sorry. And I don't like when people are mad at me. Especially you. So you doing all right? No. You want to talk about it? Mmm- No. My whole... life is a lie. WW do you say that? The hip surgeries, the nightmares, the... asthma, the seizures- All of it's connected. My parents aren't my parents. They adopted me. And... they adopted me because my birth mother tried to abort me. I guess I wasn't supposed to survive. And I barely did. All I know- Well, all they will let me know... is that I was born in a hospital in Mobile, Alabama, which is 12 hours away. And I don't know how I would get there. Or if I did go, what I would do. I just- I want answers. I want answers to all these questions. I want to be able to get on with my life. You know? Because right now, I just feel stuck. Like there's- Like there's no way out. ,/',/' [ Rock Ba//aa Faint] I'm stuck in this place that I hate. ,/',/' [ Man Singing, /nd/stincf] [ Mutters, Chuckles] Told you I didn't want to talk about it. Wow. Hannah, I- I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say. Uh- I imagine things are pretty terrible right now. But they'll get better. J,/' [ Continues] That's really... optimistic. Look. Things are gonna work out. Okay? I promise. You'll know what to do. What makes you so sure? I know you. I don't even know me. [Cell Phone Ringing ] Who's that? Alanna. I'll just call her back. No, no, no. You can answer it. Are you sure? Yeah. I mean, you should. [ Ringing Continues] Hello? He)'- No, no. Just hanging out. What's up? Um- Yeah. Yeah, sure. [ Inhaler Rattling ] I guess you can come. Look, can I- Actually, can I call you back? Yeah. No, I promise. All right. Thanks. See you. J,/' [ Continues] I am officially the worst at planning road trips. Three days before we leave, and we have no idea where we're going. Awesome. Look. Get in my car. I'll take you home. We both have exams tomorrow. That's the last thing on my mind right now, Jason. I know, but we need to s- I need to study. [Sighs] Come on. Just agree reluctantly. Please?

Wow. What a piece of junk. It's vintage classic. [Jason ] it's vintage junk. Look at it. - It's dead. - It's not dead. This is your cousin's? Yes. What does he look like? Not nearly as good as the van. [Jason ] By the way, I think I know where we're going. [ Clears Throat ] You have a wild side, Hannah. What? I know you got one deep down in there somewhere. I mean- Don't you ever wanna just go crazy? [ Patrons ] Shh! No, I don't. I need you to have a wild side, Hannah. Can I hear you say Mardi Gras? [ Patrons ] Shh! Shh! No, you can't. And are you even aware that you're in a library right now? So, did Truman tell you? Tell me what? Well, spring break. We finally decided on New Orleans. And we want you to come. Come on, Hannah. NOLA. Mardi Gras! [ Patrons ] Shh! You know, uh, Mardi Gras didn't actually start in New Orleans? Yeah, it began in Mobile, Alabama. Which is on our way, so I figured, you know, if we got some time, we can swing by there and check it out. It's a pretty cool place. Yeah. Thank you for the history lesson. I'm just saying, I don't want anyone to feel like they're stuck on this trip. You know? Like, if someone wants to go somewhere, they should go. I was doing just fine before you came over here. Do you think I'm ready for a trip like that? I think it's now or never. - It's now or never! - [ Patrons] Shh! - Come on! - [ Hannah] Can't believe this. Who's that? Sir, this is a library. [ Door Alarm Chiming ] Jason. Hey, Mr. Lawson. I'm fine. Thanks for getting back to me. How are you? Yeah. Let me guess. You're Truman, right? Yup. Yeah. This the charity you were telling me about? What is going on? I thought I fixed that. [ Clears Throat ] This is the classic upon which we'll be taking our voyage. Our M///ennium Falcon, if you will. [ Man ] Her name is Evelyn. Hey, who's the old dude, man? [Truman ] Remember Hannah? Yeah. The spaz? - Yeah. This is her dad. - Oh. Hey, dude. - Who are you? - Bmac. His cousin. And, uh, you know, I'm driving them to their thing, 'cause this is my baby, you know? [Jacob] I'm sorry. What did you say your name was again? Bmac. No, your name. Your real name. Your actual name. L-I go by Bmac. Seriously, why- Truman, I came here to talk to Jason. You mind? A little privacy, please? Absolutely. You- You should do that. - Whatever, man. - I'm sorry. What can I do for you? Hannah's sick. You know that. So why did you invite her? [ Clears Throat ] Uh- Dude. What's that guy's problem, man? It's your beard. You look like the Unabomber. Whatever, man. I don't know. I figured she might have some fun. Fun. Yeah. Honestly, I was just trying to help. You're not helping, Jason. You're not helping at all. In fact, you've made my position very uncomfortable. I'm sorry. [ Sighs 1 Look, Hannah's not listening to me right now, and I- Look, Mr. Lawson. I can't get in the middle of this. You're in the middle of this, Jason, like it or not. You are smack-dab in the middle of this thing. And I got stuff going on at my house you have no idea about. So I would appreciate it if you would just take my side on this thing, okay? Hmm? [Sighs] Fine. Yeah. I wouldn't go 10 feet in that thing if I were you. - [ Object Clatters ] - She can hear you! I didn't know that- that sticks and stones could break your beard. [ Object Clatters ] [Truck Departs] [Alarm Clock Beeping ] [Man On Rad/0 ] Here on the Jon Walden show, Re vocation Radio, your true- [ Continues, /nd/stinct] [Groans] The sun is up, and you're still here? [Clicks Tongue] Yup. Gotta go to the clinic today. Although- Wish I was going in scrubs. Had a really good talk with Hannah. - About? - About the trip. Told her I didn't think she should go, be better if she stayed here. I don't necessarily think she agreed with me, but I do think she understood. So, she's not going? [ Clicks Tongue ] I told her that we trusted her to make the right decision. So I think we're good. Okay. I'm gonna get some coffee. You want some coffee? Sure.

[Truman ] Fat Man's burgers are the best- You do not know what you're talking about when it comes to burgers- That is actually meat fillers, which are little yellow pellets that come in a cardboard box. Like, seriously. When you cook a burger, all the bad stuff drains down into the grill. [ Hannah ] it's in your body. It's inside- [ Bmac] We're not listening to you.

Wow. You're really good. Thanks. That actually was supposed to be a jingle for a barbecue company, but they thought it was too deep. [Woman ] You know, you should go on one of those reality shows. [Bmac] I don't think so. Those things are rigged, I think. You know, sometimes I write songs based on dreams I imagine other people have. - [Siren Whoops] - Tow truck! [ Grunts ] [ Chatter On Po//ce Rad/0 ] Are you with the tow truck? Sir, step away from the vehicle. - [ Rad/'0: Feedback] - You been drinking? No. Of course not. Why does everybody always think I've been drinking? - Explain this to me. - Oh. When- Nobody ever tells you you can't drive on the beach, man. They do it on TV all the time. Also, running- Curly Top, do you see any hotels on this beach? Yes. No. - Any restaurants or bars? - Is this a trick question? No. Yeah. it's because it's a land preserve. For what? Set aside for endangered turtle eggs. Turtle eggs? Dude, seriously? Am I being punked? Like, what's- - [Radio Chatter Continues] - No, that's- No. - $5,000? - He's the owner and the driver. N-No! Truman! You're the one who told me to drive here! I don't even know your real name. What is- Bro- Okay. Listen. I don't have time for this. I need to impound this car. I'm gonna ask all of you to please pick up your belongings and make your way to the curb. - I'm gonna also need your names. - Our- Our real names? - Excuse me? - Sir, can I just say something? This is my first trip like this, okay? I've never done anything like this before. And the only reason that I came is because I'm trying to get to Mobile, Alabama, because- Okay, listen, ma'am. I don't have time for this. I'm gonna have to ask all of you to make your way down- No. Just listen. I promise. I have a really good excuse. See, I'm trying to get to Mobile because... I just found out I'm adopted. Like, last week. And this is my only chance to find out who I really am. I mean, to find my mother and- Well, I think she lives there. At least I hope. And we probably deserve everything that you're trying to say, but, really, I- [ Sighs 1 I've got... $93.50- No, $93.40. This'll help- Ma'am, I'm not gonna take your money. Just take it. I'm not gonna take your money. Seriously. That was in- I thought- Comple- Hey, uh- Thanks so much for letting us off the hook- Don't talk to me. Take care of this? Yeah. Let's push it, y'all. Come on. Push, push, push! Come on, Evelyn. You can do it, Evelyn. I know it's painful! [Jason ] Truman's not doing anything. I'm- I'm hurt- [ Hannah ] Truman, I've been doing all of this. In my legs right now. You did it. JV' [ Rock] [Man] ,/~ The /ave, ,/~ That' you've tried to find a way, Hey, Hannah. [Car Horn Honks] Hey, I think- I just wanted you to know, I think it's really brave what you're doing, you know? Like the whole, you know, thing with your mom and- I just hope you find, you know, whatever it is that you're looking for, 'cause, you know, it's important. So I really shouldn't eat burgers? I guess it's just so hard for me to think about eating healthy food. I mean, like- just weirds me out. Like, and tofu? What's that stuff? Who came up with the idea to take a bean... and turn it into a sandwich that tastes like a hamburger remotely? I mean, vegans always try to tell you that, like, tofu tastes like real beef. That is untrue. ,/~ Will make us one, , I/I//// make us one ,/ J./' [Fades] [Truman ] Jojo. You ever know a guy named Jojo? I've never even heard of a guy named Jojo.

Hannah, you will be rooming with Alanna. - Is there another option? - No. Danielle paid double for her own room. I'm sleeping here in the van, so you can have my room. No, that won't work, because you're staying with me. And neither Hannah nor Alanna would- would stay with me. Would you? Get away from me, Truman. [ Door Slams ] Respect Evelyn! [Pills Rattling 1 That's a lot of pills. Yeah. [ Chuckles ] it's ridiculous, huh? [ Scoffs ] You know what I think? I think you just like to use this stuff. That way people have to be nice to you, you know? Like, Poor little Hannah. So wounded. I'm sorry. I didn't mean- Okay. You never mean to do anything, but that's the point. You still do. Why did you even come on this trip anyway? Jason invited me. We didn't want you to. He's just... too nice to say it. Um- I usually get up early, but I can set an alarm if you want. Hannah, just go to sleep. What is wrong with you? [ Sighs 1 [ Bmac Snoring ] [ Hannah Muttering ] [ Door Rattling ] [ Grunts, Sputters ] What's going on? It's just me. What are you doing?

I'm- I'm leaving, and you're staying here with your... girlfriend! I realize that I'm a problem, and that I never should have come here, so you can just go to New Orleans with everybody else in your posse... and just have fun or whatever. I don't even care any more. You're not making sense. What is wrong? Apparently I'm what's wrong. Look. I'm leaving. Don't follow me. Dude. Her dad's gonna kill you, man. He's scary, man.

I couldn't believe something so small could have such a power over me. And I did see him smile. Wonder if she's ever gonna be able to... see things from our perspective? I think we should tell her. Tell her what? Everything. Oh. No. She couldn't handle it. [ Chuckling ] I think she could. No, she couldn't. Trust me. And I think we need to trust our daughter. - [ Man ] All right. Turn. - [Shutter Clicking ] - No light. We can't see you. - [Cries] [ Sighs ] [Whistle Blows] [ Door Closes ] [ Sighs 1 [Typing 1 Breaking and entering. Do you, uh- [ Finger Tapping ] Do you understand the consequences? You do? Yeah, no. Not really. All right. Look. Why were you there? Alanna, don't freak out. [ Sighs ] Something happened, and- Long story short, me and Hannah are in jail. Yeah. it's not like we planned it. You got yourself into this. Get yourself out. Alanna, pl- [ Dial Tone] We'd gone so far, and the hospital was all I had. It's the only place that I had left. It was a dead end. [ Scoffs ] You know, if you're gonna... put me in jail, please just get it over with. 'Cause- [ Sighs] my dad's gonna kill me. Owens Free Clinic. My dad's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill you too. [ Chuckling ] This, uh- What are the odds? I had some dealings with this clinic. Um, there were some bomb threats, death threats and whatnot. I dealt with a doctor and two nurses, and the reason I recall this is because... one of the nurses was just, well- She was very kind to me. Um- Here you go. This is one of her statements. The signatures are the same. Mm-hmm. Why would she sign my birth certificate? Um- No idea. Her name is Mary. Mary Rutledge. [Typing 1 Um, phone is unlisted. There's just an address, and- It hasn't been verified in quite a while. [ Muttering ] [ Paper Shuffling ] Good luck. Wait. What about all the- Don't worry about it. Um- Look, I'm- I'm very sorry for this misunderstanding, all right? I hope you won't think badly of our city and you'll come back again. So, we're free to go? Yeah. [ Chuckles ] Jackie out there will, uh, get your stuff and check you out. Oh. You know what? Wait a minute. What will you say? I-I mean, if you find your mother, what will you say? I'm just- I'm just curious. I don't know. Well- My wife has this thing she says. To be human is to be beautifully flawed." And- Well, she's- She's five months pregnant with our fourth, so I think I understand what you're going through and how hard it must be. So- You know, life isn't always black and white. So, hate the crime, not the criminal. All right. Good luck. [ Hannah ] Thank you. Do you want me to go with you? [ Knocking ] Yes. Can I help you? Are you Mary? Yes. I don't know how else to- Why did you sign this? [ Exhales] How did you find me? A police officer recognized your signature. Oh. Sergeant Dodd. You do favor her. She was a pretty girl. Barely 18. I wasn't much older, but... I was older. You know, the girls that came there, they really knew what they wanted, you know. They were sure of it. But your mother, she was conflicted. I'm the one that took her in the back and prepped her for the procedure. The abortion? Yes. The abortion. She tried to convince me that she was making the right decision. But, you know, she was really trying to convince herself. She told me she didn't even know the fella. Didn't know his name. Met him at a bar and... had a night together, and then he was gone. I listened. Listened to her like I did a hundred girls before her. Nodded. Told her I understood. For some of those girls, I was their only friend. Halfway through- Well, something must have gone wrong. I wish I knew what. But... when I went to see your mother, she was just awakening, and the doctor was telling her that it had been a failed attempt. Is that... normal? For him. [ Sighs 1 There were things that happened there. Terrible things. Things they had me do. When you hear something enough times, somehow you start to believe it. It was tissue. That's what they told us. It was tissue that couldn't survive. Nonviable tissue. Your mother... came back the next day. She said she wanted to finish the procedure, that she had to go to school, she had to have a career, and she knew she couldn't do that with the baby, so this was the only way. I took one look at her, and I knew she was in labor... and too young and naive to know it. I had two choices. I chose to take her to the hospital. When we got there, she was ready to deliver. She begged me to stay. I was really the only one she had, so I did. Your brother came first. I'll always- Brother? I'm sorry. What are you talking about? Hannah, your mother was carrying twins. And your brother came first. And I'll always remember him. He was so teeny. He was less than a pound. And he was... damaged. His arm was missing. Completely gone. Torn off during the failed attempt. And he was just- I saw him shakin' there. I saw the pain. And I didn't see no tissue. I just saw the face of a child. But you were the big surprise. Nobody knew about you. Not even your mother. And you came out- Big eyes. Just beautiful. I never went back to that clinic. And I never nursed again. Was this mine? Your mother's. She gave it to me when she left the hospital. Then she just left. They looked for her, but she had changed her name... and she was long gone. My brother- How long did- How long before, you know, he- Hannah, your parents adopted both of you. I-I would come by now and then... and see you in the N.l.C.U. They were always there. They sat right by the incubators... and would read passages of the Bible. They were praying people. I remember. And he fought hard. He never did leave the hospital. He died four months after y'all were born. I know where your birth mother is. I saw her not long ago. And she did get that education. And she does have that career. H-Her name is, uh, Cindy Hastings now. She works at a law firm in town. Finally home, after all that running. I've needed to have my say. Thank you. [Sniffling, Sobbing ] [Sobbing Continues] [ Paper Ripping 1 [Sobbing Continues] Hi. Hey. You gonna go see her? Yeah. I have to. You know, I'm s- I'm starting to think... that I shouldn't have found out about all of this. Because... deep down, there's always just been this... feeling- Nothing that's happened is your fault. [ Sobbing ] [ Knocking ] Come in. [ Door Opens ] He)'- Gonna be okay? All right. Well, we gotta go sleep in the ice machine or something. How are you paying for this? I saved a few bucks for this trip. Don't worry. I'll bill you later. Hey, Jason? You know what the last thing was that I remember before I blacked out? The last thing that went through my mind? Falling. [ Sighs ] Falling into perfect blue water, holding your hand. Why have you always been there for me? Good night.

How may I help you? Uh, yeah. She's really booked up for the day though. Monday. Mm-hmm. Hi. Can I help you? I, uh- I'm sorry. Um, Stacy didn't tell me that I had another appointment. I'm sorry that I'm just, like, in your office like this. Um- I-I'm Hannah. I'm- I'm Hannah Lawson. Are you, uh, one of the new interns? You know, I would love to talk, but I have a lunch appointment. I was- I was born October 7, 1991, at Mobile General Hospital. I ca- I guess I came here... because I hoped that that, um- that meant something to you. Um- Uh, Stacy, uh, could you, uh, please cancel my lunch and hold all my calls. I didn't know what you wanted. Hey, honey. You ready? Uh, we gotta go. Lily's waiting for us in the lobby. - [Cindy Clears Throat] - Oh. I'm sorry. Uh, who's this? I, um- I have- I have no idea. I don't know. I'm Hannah. Hi, Hannah. I don't know where you got your information from, but it's not correct. I-I don't know what you're referring to. I can't take any more cases right now, but, um, Raymond, uh- Raymond down the hallway, perhaps he can- he can help you with your civil dispute. I'm sorry. Hannah! Hey! Look, I'm really sorry. Yeah, she just- She didn't even say anything. No. It wasn't me. I swear. - Are you following me now? - Get in the car, Hannah. I'm taking you home. No! I'm not going anywhere with you. How do you even know where we are? His girlfriend called me to tell me where you were. She also told me you had been arrested. I can't believe that you would lie to me. You can't believe / would lie to you. - Get in the car. We're going home now. - No. - Get in the car, now. - Fine! Fine. Mr. Lawson- Stay out of this, Jason. Mr. Lawson, I- I said, stay out of it! I know how you must feel about this. You have no idea how I must feel about this, and you can't know until you have a daughter of your own. So stay out of it! She's not your daughter. And she has every right to find out who she is. I'm gonna make this very simple. You stay away from my daughter. You don't call her. You make no contact whatsoever. Do you understand me? You lied to me, Jason. I expected much more from you. Look at me. [ Engine Starts] We gonna talk about this, or what? Until we get this whole thing straightened out, I don't think you should go back to school. I see no reason in the world why I should continue funding this sort of behavior. What happened down there anyway? Why do you care? Why do I care? I care because I'm your father. I love you. If you loved me, you would have told me. [ Woman On P.A. System, /nd/st/not ] You wanna know the truth? I'll tell you the truth. It was three month- Three months after we adopted you, we find out that the m- the medical bills are not gonna be covered by the insurance. We lose everything- the house. We have to file for bankruptcy. I am one year- one year away from finishing med school. So tell me something, Hannah. How does that make me the bad guy? I'm sorry I was such a burden! Th-That is not what I said. It's what you meant. Hannah, stop. [ Luggage Thuds ] Stop! What was his name? What was whose name? My brother. L- I found- I found my mom. [Voice Breaking ] Sweetheart, I always meant to tell you about that. Great. Jonathan. Your brother's name was Jonathan. [ Car Horn Honking ] Hey, guys- Oh, look. The prodigal returns. He)'- Where's Alanna? Good to see you too, buddy. You know, if you had been here, maybe I wouldn't have had the audacity to drink somethin' called a... hand grenade. That would have been a good thing, 'cause about three sips in, you don't know who you are any more. Now, when I say I have no recollection of those events, I mean I don't remember... anything. Nothing. Not the argument. Not the fight. Not this guy. This little shiner. Oh, and look. It comes with a court date. Faux fi'ais. Disorderly conduct. I have a criminal record, Jason. I'd like to go home. Oh, I got your luggage. It's in my room. Thanks, buddy. I wanted to say that... I went too far and... I'm sorry. Where are you going? Home. We're going home tomorrow.

You look so pretty in this picture. You look pregnant. I was. Twenty weeks in that picture. Twins. You were pregnant with twins? What happened? We, uh- We lost them. I started volunteering at this pregnancy crisis center. There was this beautiful cathedral... around the corner, and I would go there to pray at lunch. And I'll never forget. October 17. I went back to work... and I saw a bulletin, and it said, Twins. Abandoned. Twenty-four weeks. And we knew. You and your brother... would have been the same age. Hannah. [ Sniffling ] You are our miracle. That's why it's so hard to let you go, honey. You mean so much to us. I know. ,/J [ Guitar] [Hannah ] Which cathedral? [ Grace] Oh. /t was beautiful.

I'm actually a- I'm Baptist. I guess you should know that. [ Chuckling ] And... why did you come? I don't know, really. I guess I'm trying to figure out how to let go of... things. "Things"? Can't figure out... how to let go... of the fact that I feel hatred for myself... and others. There. I said it. What is it that you want to say? Just- [ Exhales ] say what you feel. Well, three weeks ago I found out that my entire life is a lie. So I went on a trip. I thought if I went, that I... would get all these answers, and somehow when I got back, I would feel different. But I don't. My parents aren't really my parents. [ Sighs 1 And my real parents... tried to abort me. And I have a brother. Well, I had a brother. He died shortly after the, um- I'm angry at my parents for not telling me sooner... and making me think that I was just like everybody else. I'm angry at my real mom... for- for not wanting me. Why didn't she want me? What's so wrong with me? I found her. And she still doesn't want me. And I feel guilty. Part of me feels like- [ Sighs 1 he should be alive... and I shouldn't. I wonder if he would have been a better person than me, what he would have been like. I just- I- I just hate myself... for feeling this way. [ Exhales ] I see. [ Exhales ] This, uh, cathedral... was built in 1893. Named for Saint Paul the Apostle. It's- [ Chuckles ] magnificent. He wrote a letter to the church at Colossae and said, Because we have been forgiven by God, we should forgive each other. In Christ, you are forgiven. And because you are forgiven, you have the power to forgive. To choose to forgive. Let it go. Hatred is a... burden... you no longer need to carry. Only in forgiveness... can you be free, Hannah. A forgiveness that is... well beyond your grasp... or mine. [ Chuckles ] A forgiveness that you- you can't find on a trip... or even in this cathedral. But if the Son shall set you free, you will be free indeed." Well- [ Laughs ] I guess you'd better close up then, huh? What was your brother's name? His name was Jonathan. Jonathan wants you to live your life, Hannah. Live it to the full. [ Knocking ] Come in. [Sighs] Um- I've been giving this a lot of thought, and I wanted to tell you that I... am sorry. I'm sorry that I... overreacted. So you're still enrolled in school. Thanks, Dad. And I think you should probably pack. What for? What's this? I know that you need to finish this. But, with your permission, I'd like to be there when you do. Uh- But there is this one place I would like to take you... on the way, if it's okay with you. Sure. The doctor said there wasn't much brain activity, but... I saw him smile. We truly believed that God would heal him. We were just so young, we didn't know what to tell ourselves, so naturally we never told you. Days became years, years became decades, and you still didn't know. After he died, I just remember holding you. I would hold you for hours. I would not let you out of my sight. 'Cause I was afraid that if I lost you too- So I would just hold you because I couldn't let go. And, sweetheart, I still haven't. [Sniffling ] And I'm sorry, Hannah. I'm sorry for the journal. I'm sorry for keeping so much from you, for how controlling I've been. But, sweetheart, it's not because I don't trust you. It's because I'm trying, honestly, to learn how to trust God again. So please, don't, uh- Dad. Yeah? L I love you. And it's okay. Yeah? Thank you for bringing me here. Sure this is how you wanna do it? [ Mouths Word ] [ Intercom Beeps ] Stacy, can- [ Sniffles ] [ Sobbing ] [ Phone Ringing ] [ Beep ] Hello? Jason. /tis Dr. Lawson. Listen, / wanted to say that I assumed the worst about you. But Hannah talked to me. She told me how you treated her with respect, how much you carea and I think you should call her. I, uh- Listen, I'm not say/ng that I think you have to call her. But I just think that you should. I'm not trying to PW I just want to know what your intentions are about my daughter. I love her. You need to call her. Yeah. [ Chuckles ] Okay. Yeah.

He said, We think that you would play the birth mother in this film. Jon e-mailed me the script, and of course I was so excited, I think I sat down that very night. I got to the point of the birth mother, and, um, I was- I was so overwhelmed I started crying over it because... the story actually had been truly written for me. And Jon and Andy didn't even know my backstory at all. And she read it... and literally called me back, just weeping about the script and said, How did you know? And we said, What are you talking about? And she said, um, Twenty years ago I was working in a law firm"- Which is very similar to the story. She said she was in a relationship, she found out she was pregnant... and she decided to have an abortion. [ Rigbvl It was easier to get rid of the child, to not be questioned again, rather than to have a child... and be looked upon at that time like another failure. Um- [ Chuckles ] And... so many times, uh, I think especially as young women, we carry that, um- that burden that we're gonna look like a failure, that- that it's shameful. And, um, you know, you can hide a secret for a long time... of abortion... unless you verbally speak about it. Nobody knows. Nobody knows except my husband, my therapist and some people like that. And we were blown away by that. And she said, I feel like this is God telling me it's time for me to share my story." I just remember hearing Jon on the other line going, Wow. Like, wow. From the post-abortive mother, it was very important to be very sensitive to that... and for this to be a healing movie for them. And so having Shari's voice and having her play the role was just phenomenal... to make sure that that came across very authentic and very sensitive. [Jon Erwin ] Uh, I think- I think as we went forward, uh, and filmed her scene, she wasn't acting. I mean, it was as real as you could get. It was one of the more moving things I've ever seen. [ Rigby ] We went into it, and I remember the cameras rolling and- I just- Right as I walked into the room, I just knew that- I just knew that the Lord was with me... and that it was just... complete healing. And the moment that I slide down that door and that I'm crying... and I'm feeling that- That wasn't acting. That was my moment with God, and him with me, to say, It's okay, it's over, and you've been forgiven.
