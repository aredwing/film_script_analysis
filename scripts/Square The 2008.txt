Thought you were on holidays. Is everything... Love is blind, Ray. We're building a honeymoon resort, not the Palazzo de fucking Gucci. Yeah, I know, Gil. Good bed to fuck on. The rest doesn't matter. What's this about designer fittings? Better not be too late to retract. Well, I've got them down to your target price. I tell you, Ray, in six months time, couples rooting in their Jacuzzis won't know the pains that went through for this swamp. All right. Get on with it. All right, so, it's just a square? To start with, but I want you to do the whole site. It's a decent whack of concrete. Come on, I'll show you. So, you're cutting deals now, mate? It's a bit of a surprise. You saving up for something special? So, this stays between us, obviously. Yep. Listen, Barney, you said thirty grand kicks back to me. Is that cash? Yep. - Hey, Charlie. - Gidday, boss. Forty. Make it 40, and I'll award you the contract right here. Wendy, I'll pick up those towels tomorrow on the way in. Okay, great. Thank you. There you are. I've been calling. Have you had your phone off? No. I had a meeting. You know we're at Jake and Jenny's tonight? Okay. - Ray? - Yeah? Since when do you do your own washing? Found this at the bottom of your closet. What is it, sweetheart? Hey? What's the matter, darling? Ray! Hello? Hello! It's just me, babe. How was your day? You all right in there? What are you doing? - What? - I said what are you doing? How's Mum? Yeah, she's fine. Kept her company till your sister came home. Righto. I'm going to have a shower. What happened to your hand? You know, just a bit of mischief. Carla! You gonna get that? Gidday. Is this your dog? - Yeah, mate, yeah. - It is? Right. - Where was he? - He was in the backyard. He must have taken a swim. I'm Ray Yale, by the way. Yeah, Ray. Greg Smith. How're you doing? Yeah, not too bad. I'm just across the river. Good on you. All right, all yours. All right. Thanks for that. Must have got out the side or something. - Yeah, no worries. - Yeah, cheers. Who was that? - Why didn't you answer it? - I was out the back. Blokes are here. You want to put some food on for us? I'll be there in a sec. Good on you. If I'm paying someone to go down and have a look, what will they charge you? A thousand bucks? All I'm saying is, you could have one to keep for the same price. What, a fucking shark or a shark cage? No, a shark cage. Shark. What, so you're saying you've just got to make it out of your standard everyday hardware screen door, mate? Not screen. Fuck, no. Security doors. High grade security doors. You weld four of them together. They seem to keep a great white out, easy. Yeah, mate, 'cause the last time a couple of fucking great whites tried to get through my fucking front door, mate, it fixed them right up, I can tell you. It would. It would. Fuck spending that. Two days, two nights. No fucking way. For the same price, you can have a shark cage for life. Why don't you just take your caravan down there? There's this guy, Eddie, and his friend, Leonard. Whenever they're around, there is always something going on. But it's never been this big. What are you talking about? Close your eyes. Keep them closed. There's fifty times that. We have to take it, Ray. We have to take it. What? You do it. One night when we're out, and then we go. Or I go. You follow later, when it's safe. Hang on. Where did you get it from? Well, think about it. It's cash. It can't be decent. Which is why taking it is a bad idea. What if you ransacked the place? I can't ransack your place. Well, then, we get someone else to do it. I know we can find someone like that. Well, no, it's not just that. It's just that, you know, I mean, you'd have to burn the place down if you really wanted this money to disappear. Hey, I'm joking. - I'm not. - Carla... Ray, can't you see? This is our chance. Carla, you're talking about a really serious crime. Well, it's not like we would be hurting anybody. What? Carla, no. No. God, it's all talk, isn't it? - What is? - You and me, and going away, and leaving your wife. No, no, that's not right, Carla. Right. It's all bullshit. - If this is about money... - It's not about money. I want... I want you to do something. Something. Because for months it's been, "Not now. We can't go yet. "Just wait a little bit longer." Carla. Carla, wait, wait, wait. Look, wait. Carla, what you're suggesting is... "And the bad news," he says, "is you've got 24 hours to live." And the guy says, "Well, what the bloody hell's the good news?" The doctor says, "You see that young receptionist there on your way in?" The guy says, "Yeah." "The good news is I'm fucking her." That's a good one. Hey, guess what, Ray? You see that young receptionist in there? The good news is... - What about Lauren? - It's just a bit of fun. Yeah. So, did you get the check okay? - Yeah. - Good, good, good. Look, what's the possibility of me getting some of my cut up front on this? - Well, how much are we talking here, Ray? - Well, all of it if possible. But, you know, half or... Well, yeah, half. Got to watch the quiet ones, huh? Yeah, nah, you're sweet. - All right. - I'll come by your office, yeah? Thanks, mate. - So there's your problem, mate. - What? - See this crack? - Yeah. Well, I don't stock these, but I can order one in for you. - Have it back in operation for you by Friday. - Right. - Well? - Well, what? Would you like me to go ahead and order it, or... No, I'd like you to be able to fix things like that on the spot like you're supposed to. Well, that doesn't answer my question. Yes, make it. And, mate, don't leave your ute just sitting there, blocking everything. Sorry about that. - Hello? - Carla, it's me. We need to talk about this. What are you doing, Ray? I'm outside the house. Listen, I am doing something. I've been getting some money together, so we... Ray, please don't call me anymore. Carla, wait. You... - Gidday. - Gidday, mate. How're you going? - Not bad. - Been up to his old tricks again, huh? Yeah, yeah. Must have some bullshit dog food at your house. Yeah, that's true. Breakdown on Fuller Road. Yeah, why don't you try closing the side gate? Don't live in a tent. Bye. Cheers. Yeah, mate... - I know someone who can help us. - Forget it, Ray. - No, I'm serious. - Go home. No, I'll do it. We can take the money. But if we're going to do it, I just... I just need to know that... Are you sure? Hello. Chris. You Chris? Sit down. Wipe the guilty look off your face. Relax. This is just a lunch with friends. We're all friends of Roger's, so... Let me talk you through it first. We don't talk about this or that out loud, or to anybody else. All right, whatever happens here, stays with us. You understand? All right, second, once it's done, you wipe it away. It never happened. We never met. Say yes, Chris, or nod, or say something. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Now, pass it over. Anyone else got the number? Haven Cove. Is it true what they say about the sharks down there? Apparently, yeah. I've never seen any. That's a good drawing. It's pretty good. Right. Money. Life's strange, isn't it? Things we do. It's all there. When do you want this done? Wendy. Martha, hi. Hello. How are you? Gidday, mate. How are you? - Good to see you. Very well. Hello. - How are you? - Lovely to see you. - Ray, how are you? - I'm Carla. Hi. Hi. - Oh, yeah. Martha, Ray, this is Carla. - Hi. - Hi. - So, what you got there? - I've got some white wine. I'm with my husband and his sister, but thank you. It's really nice to meet you and Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Keep your eyes in your head. Can you be a bit helpful, please? You get my phone off the charger and put it in the van. Hold on. I want you to take this, put it in the directory and put it on the dash. Come on. Lily. Listen, I'm not going to stay and watch, okay? I promise. If you start looking at this thing like something I gotta do, it's going to help me out a lot. Go on. Hey, kids, look. What's this coming down the river, kids? The volunteer firemen are taking a very special delivery this year. Why don't you all go down and give him a warm welcome? Hey, Mum. Yeah, can you feed Muz for me? I forgot to do it. Yeah, don't give him the canned shit. There's proper dog meat in the fridge. Isn't Mum at your place? No, we had a fight. You know what she's like. No, just make yourself at home. Yeah. All right, see you, Mum. - How is she? She still got the shits? - She's all right. - Excuse me. - Where you going now? To the toilet. Where you going? Need a pillow now. Ray. Ray! Phone. Sorry, guys. I'm going to have to take this. Hi. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Chris? I think he's gone, Chris. Hold on. Shit. He's just outside. Okay, I need you to stop him now. Okay, but he's going to want to talk to you himself. No, no, I don't care about that. Just tell him he has to postpone it. - I'll get him so you two can talk. - No, no, just tell him. My phone's about to die. Can you please just tell him? Okay, I'll tell him. Fuck! I need... Fuck it. Wait, Billy! Billy, stop! Billy! Ta. Hey, hey, hey! Where're you going? I can't let you go in there. - It's my house! - You can't go in there! Get back! Mum. Where is she? That's Muz. Shit. Mum. Mum! Mum! My mother's in there! Mum! My fucking mother's in there! Mum! No! Mum! Get the fuck off me! Mum! Mum! If only I hadn't have been fighting with her, none of this would have happened. I've got to go, Martha. Here it is. Ray? ...this time in Haven Cove. Police are still investigating the cause of the fire. An opposition spokesman today said the government should be taking... Lily! We're on TV! Firefighters did their best but were unable to save the property, which was well alight when they arrived. Tragically, an elderly lady lost her life in the blaze which started while other family members attended local Carols by Candlelight celebrations. The woman, 62-year-old Gladys Smith, was visiting family. Billy. Fuck! Fuck. It's okay. You can come out. You evil fucking dog. - What happened? - What do you mean, "What happened"? I called last night. I called and I called it off. You listen. This wasn't part of the plan. This isn't what I fucking signed on for, mate. This changes everything. Wait, wait. Listen. Listen to me. Not on the phone. We're on tomorrow like we said. Wait. You... - I said tomorrow! - Wait... What did he say? He reckons he called it off. Can you fucking believe that? He didn't call, did he? No. What happened, Ray? You looked at me. The way that you looked at me... Well, they went ahead with it anyway. - Why would they do that? - I don't know. I don't know. - Carla, listen... - Ray, we have killed someone. - We're murderers. - No, no, no, no, we can fix this. Who the fuck was that? Did they hit the office? No, no. Only thing missing's a small generator. Little red one. I'd say it was just one bloke. Do you think it was an inside job? Well, whoever it was, looks like he knew what he was after. - What do you reckon? Should I call Miles? - No. It's not really worth it. Not just for that. Hey, Charlie, when's that truck arriving? What happened, huh? Did you talk to her? Where's the money, huh? - How much is there? - Half. - Looks like it. Why? - Because I called. I... You have one week. And don't fuck around. I know who you are. Great. Okay, she'll see you then. Bye. Hi. Leonard. What can I do for you? I was just closing up, so is there something that you needed? - Yeah, I'd like to make an appointment. - Okay. Maybe I could come in one night after work. We're open late on Thursdays. As long as it's you. See you then. - You ready? - Yeah. What is it? Carla? He knows the money wasn't in the house. It's not just Greg, Ray. I think I know who saw us the other night. That guy Leonard, he came into the salon yesterday. He was acting all... I don't know. He knows Greg, Ray. What if he says something? You don't talk to him, okay? Just let me sort it out. I'll handle it. Ray, what have we done? What? Fuck! Ray! Hello! Merry Christmas! - Thank you. - Hello. Ray! It's such a shame. But they've moved in with his sister, so... Do you think they'll rebuild? - Well, Dale thinks they're under suspicion. - Well, no. Everyone comes under suspicion with fires. It's just... - Guilty till proven innocent. - It's standard procedure. Still. Poor Carla, she insists on still coming to work. - It's probably for the best. - Yeah, I guess. - So, they think it was electrical? - It was the Christmas tree lights. Funny thing about Christmas tree lights, actually. You know, they're mostly manufactured in countries where they don't actually celebrate Christmas. What the fuck, Ray? - What the fuck were you doing at my house? - I wasn't at your house. I saw you at my fucking house. What were you doing there? Well, what were you doing with the generator? You think I'm a fucking idiot? - Go home or I'll call the police. - Go ahead. I'm just dying to tell them what I saw the other night. That's got you interested, hasn't it? Dickhead. Leonard. Leonard, wait. Wait. Are you blackmailing me? Get your hands off me! Carla. Hi. Smithy home? Yeah. Come in. Get us some rollies? Sure. Hey, I hear one of the corners is damaged. What's the story? No, it's going to clear up. I called the bureau. It's not the rain I'm worried about. It's the grid. Yeah, Barney, how far away, mate? Well, it's just looking a bit ugly here. - What's going on? - This reo's not the right size. No, fuck that, mate. Get them to pull up some reo. Hey, Charlie, pull up some reo from the breached wing. Bring her down. Come on, all of you! - They're not the same size! - No, just do it, will you? - I'm pulling the plug, Ray! - What? - A bloke down south can take it now. - No, no, this'll be done in a few minutes. Mate, in a few minutes, it's going to be a fucking swimming pool. - Jesus, Barney. - Can't keep this shit turning all day, mate. - Barney! - Let it go, Ray. Fuck! I'm sending these boys home. Hello? Who is this? Is she? Where's Rita? She's in the shower. Fuck, I don't know, mate. How long does a shower take, five minutes? Yeah, I know it was wet, Barney, but it was just a basic slab job. Yeah, well, you wanna go pouring in conditions like that, you're an idiot. You'd be tearing the whole thing up again. I'm going to have to come back. You know, I've got a bunch of really big jobs on next week, right? - It's fucking Christmas time. - I make the decision, I live with it. Ray, don't tell me how I should run things. Okay, okay. Just how soon can we get you back out here? Well, seems we missed our window this week. - You got your cash... - No, no, I need it done this week, - not next week. - Sorry, mate, no can do. - Just be ready next time. - Barney... - Hi. - Gary. Ray, hi. Mind if I take a moment of your time here, mate? No, that's okay, Gary. Just grab a chair. So, what can I do for you? Well, I'm here on a little matter regarding Leonard Long. It's been four days since anyone's seen him. Really? I had a look about inside his place. Yeah? Any clues? Just that the guy likes porn. But don't tell anyone I... His work manifest says this was the last place he was on the job. Ordered a part for a tip truck. Yeah, he finished up here Christmas Eve. It was an alternator. Anything I should know? Not that I can think of at the moment, but if anything comes to mind, I'll let you know. Might ask around a few of the boys, if that's okay. Yeah, yeah, go for it. Talk about dusting off police procedure. I feel kind of bad, but it's nice to finally have stuff to do. Bit of a fire. Bit of death, now this. - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah, good on you, mate. - Hello? - Yeah, it's Chris. Yeah, I know who it is. We need to meet. One, two, three, four, five, six... - Hey, Barn. - Hey, Jake, how're you doing, mate? - Good to see you. Excuse me. - Hang tight. - Hi. How are you? - Jenny, this is my wife, Lauren. Hey, Ray? Ray? Would you mind grabbing a couple of bottles of champagne from the garage, mate? - Sure. - Thanks. Cheers. Just going to the loo. She's her mum's baby when she does that. Ray, we're in trouble. Greg and Eddie have been to Leonard's. They're on to us, Ray. If Leonard does know something, - it's just a matter of time... - No, no. The police came around. No one's seen him. Everyone just thinks he's taken off. Why would he take off? Well, he broke into the site. Maybe... Have you guys seen Mia? - No. - Not here. Greg is not going to stop, Ray. - Carla... - I'll get the money - and I'll meet you at your office. - Listen to me. - We can be interstate by morning. - I can't. Not yet. If we don't leave soon, something's going to happen. I know it. Carla, we should get back. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Happy New Year! Muz! All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll let you go out. Did you write this, huh? Did you write this? Is that your perfume? You sent this to me, didn't you? You sent this to me! No, I didn't! I don't know what you're talking about. Please don't rape me. I wasn't going to hurt you. I thought that you were blackmailing me. I thought it was you. I'm sorry. Why did you let it happen? Why didn't you call it off? Hey! Hey! Not yet, boys. - What? - Sorry. Water out, the grid back down, then you can break. Pushing on. Let's go! - Hi, Barney. - Gidday, mate. There you are, that's it. That's the last of it. Let's just hope we can trust that weather page, eh? Yep. Hey, Jake, can you sort that out? Dopey's done it again! - We'll need to get the trucks in, eh? - Yep. Come on. Put some grunt in there! Fuck! You're on top of him. Reverse back! Reverse back! You're on top of him. I'll drag him out. Drag him out. Drag him out. No, it'll take too long. Bring one of your trucks down and get those fucking cement trucks out of the way. - Come on! - Keep those legs together. Wrap that round. On my call. All right? One, two, three, up. Right, mate. Get him on the tray. Hold that tight. Got him under there. It's all right, mate. It's all right. Hey, hey, boys, they got him. They got him, okay? - Let's just move this fucking thing. - This is bullshit. What, haven't you ever seen anyone get injured before, huh? Come on, back to work. Well, what do you want me to do, declare a public fucking holiday? He's taken care of, for Christ's sake. Back you go. - Come on, start this fucking thing! - What the fuck's got into you? - Jesus, mate. - We've got things to do, okay? Things have got to be fucking done and finished. The concrete's not just going to pour itself, is it? Hey! You! Where the fuck do you think you're going? Get back here. - Move them out! - You... Barney, mate, mate, just give me a minute. We'll move this thing... Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it. Jake. Jake. Mr. Smith. What can I do you for? Wanted to have a word with you. Can you give us a minute? What was all that about today? That was some performance, Ray. All the boys are saying you should get an Academy Award. Sorry, mate. I'm just under a bit of pressure at the moment, you know? Are you calling in deals? Is that what this is about? No, no, no. God, no. It's just the schedule. You know what Hubbard's like. Go home, Ray. Get some rest. So, how's Leonard? I mean Charlie. Any word? If there's any change, I'll let you know. All right. He comes home Christmas Eve, makes a couple of calls, takes the bike and seemingly nothing else. Excuse me. Gidday, Uncle Gil. What's going on? Really? Okay, hold on. I'll take a ride down. Where're you going? Jesus Christ, Smithy. Walk up and scare the shit out of me. Yeah, where're you going? I'm visiting my brother. I know about the calls. What? Don't you dare. - Don't you fucking insult me. - Hey, hey... - Don't you fucking insult me. - Hey, hey, I got nothing to hide, mate. Now, you listen to me. I got a message from him, asking me to call him. I did. He never got back to me. Where is he? Did you hear what I just said? I don't know. - Where is he? - I don't fucking know. - Where the fuck is he? - Honest to God! Fuck, I don't have a fucking clue, Smithy. What, you think me and Leonard fucked you over? All right. Well, why would I take you to his house, then, if I was in... Fuck, Smithy! Where is he? Fuck! Okay, okay, all right, all right, all right, I'm gonna tell you! I'm gonna tell you. All right. I told him we had something going, but there is no way he had any idea where you'd stashed it. Mate, I didn't know where you'd kept it and half of it was mine. I thought you were keeping it at your depot. So, who was it then, eh? Who else might have known about it? Makes you wonder, doesn't it? Come on, mate. I know you've thought about it. Ray. Can you be ready to leave tonight? Well, I don't know. Maybe. Well, yes. I need you to be ready. Just wait for my call. Jesus. Greg. You frightened me. Working late? Yeah, I was just leaving. So, I'll see you at home? I've got to ask you something. Is there something you want to tell me? About Leonard? I don't know what you're talking about. - Don't lie to me! - I'm not! - Come here. - Greg! You stole from me. You burned down our house with my fucking mother in it! You fucking bitch! Fuck! You fucking... - Jesus, Greg, what are you... - Open the bag. - Greg, it's... - Open the bag. Open it! Come on, Greg! No, Greg! No, Greg. Jake. What are you doing? Mate, it's not what you're thinking. It was an accident. What's in here, Ray? I can explain it. Come on, Jake. Just... Let's just go sort this out. - You're the one who fucked up the grid. - Please, just put the shovel down. Come on, Jake, talk to me. I'll talk. I'll talk to the cops. Jake! Jake, it was an accident. Jake! Jake! Come on, Jake. Come on, mate. Pull over! Wait, Jake! Jake! It was an accident! I didn't mean to... Oh, God. Oh, God. Hey, what is this? What's all that about? - What'd he do to you? - Nothing. - Are you telling me the truth? - He didn't do anything. - All right, when was he here? - He didn't hurt me. I didn't ask you that. Just tell me when. The day he didn't show up. - I'm sorry. - Just you stay here and pack your stuff, okay? He called, Billy! He called. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The baby's fine, Mr. Yale. I'm so sorry about your friend, but listen. You're a real hero, you know that? She's going to be okay. - Carla, where are you? - Ray, are you here? No, I won't be long. I just have one more thing I have to do. Come down the side, there's nobody here. Okay. - Raymond fucking Yale. - Gil, you're back. You're like a deer in the headlights, you stupid fucking monkey. Go ahead, answer it. - Are you listening? - Yeah. Room 16. Carss Park Motel. You've got 10 minutes. Right, let's go. One man points his dick in the wrong direction and here we are. Now I know why you were in such a hurry to cement over that square. Money. Hey! Money. - Gary. - Ray. He's alone. I handcuffed him to the sink. Who? Who's in there? Jesus, are you serious? Get in there! Barney. His ute's out back. His wife Lauren dobbed him in. Cooking the books, eh, Ray? That's no great invention. Shit, I've done it myself. Trouble with blokes like this is, they get greedy. Suck blokes like you in, the kickbacks. Then they blackmail you for your share. Him and his wife have been doing it for a while. Then she discovered he's been nailing his secretary. Thank Christ for infidelity, I say. Now, Ray, this whole affair has really hurt me. You've been a decent worker for me in the past, and for the most part, you've saved me money. But if you fuck me again, I'll fuck you even harder! You understand? Right. Now get out of my fucking sight before I change me fucking mind. I'm sorry. He says someone else knows. It's got nothing to do with this. It's been sorted out. Has it? - I swear to you on my life. - Your life isn't worth much to me. Let's start this again. Who else knows? - Nobody. - Just tell him. Hey, point the gun at me. Point the gun at me. - One. - She's got nothing to do with this. - Two. - She's got nothing to do with this. Hey, you've got the wrong idea! Then what the fuck were you doing at my place? It's about something else. It's about a kickback at work. Look, I made a big mistake. I did the wrong thing and I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. But please, nobody else knows. I swear to you. Please let her go. Please. I want the money you owe me. Okay, okay. Yeah. Okay, so where is it? - It's in there. - Go get it. - Take it. Please, just let us go. - Hey! You, it's okay. Go get it. Down there. Wait. Open it. Get on your knees. Turn around. - Why? What... What... - You just shut up, mate. - Do what I'm telling you. - You've got the money. - Nobody else knows... - What are you, a fucking idiot? It's okay. It'll be okay. We're going to be all right. What the fuck! No, Ray! Ray!
