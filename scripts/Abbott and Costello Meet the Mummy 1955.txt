For two bold adventurers... are about to discover... another kind of mummy. I'll have a waiter for you in a minute, sir. Hey, the meat's on fire. How stupid can you get? How stupid do you want me to be? There you are, sir. The meat is still on fire. Dr. Zoomer, have you any statement for the press? You may say that I have discovered the mummy of Klaris... Prince of Evil. And that somewhere in the sarcophagus is a clue... which will lead to the discovery of the tomb of Princess Ara. I see. That's very interesting. Go quickly and tell Semu that we have located Klaris... and will return him to the tomb of his people. And the Doctor? He will not escape punishment. Well, as soon as I can find two trustworthy men to accompany my mummy... I will ship it to the States. Who is that? Dr. Zoomer. Where's Rontru? In the other room. Rontru. Yes? Dr. Zoomer found the mummy of Klaris. Then get it. Have you no fear of the curse of Klaris? There is no curse that a gun or a knife can't cure. Get Klaris away from Dr. Zoomer. It won't be easy. You follow the Doctor home. If anything should happen to him... it will be blamed on the curse of Klaris. Past the pyramids, near the ruins of an old temple... is a large rock. Search there and... Now this is the place. I overheard Dr. Zoomer say he needed a couple of men... to accompany his mummy back to the States. Is she afraid to travel by herself? She? No, his mummy is a he. What's wrong with that? Some mummies are men, some mummies are women. It's a strange country. What's strange about it, Lou? Your mummy, wasn't she a woman? I never had a mummy. What'd your father do? Win you in a crap game? What's the matter? I thought you were gonna slap me. I said stop that nonsense. Beloved Klaris... you will soon be returned to your people. Now come on. We'll go in here and try and get the job. Let's get back to the States. Dr. Zoomer. Must have went out to lunch. No. A man wouldn't go out and leave his door open... with a valuable mummy in the house. Dr. Zoomer? Dr. Zoomer? Dr. Zoomer! Something funny about this. We'd better look around. I'll look in that room there. You search this one. Dr. Zoomer. Dr. Zoomer? Dr. Zoomer? Mrs. Zoomer? Is your husband here? Mrs. Zoomer? Mrs... Lou, what's the matter? In there. Bandages with eyes. The mummy of Klaris! Nobody could have a mummy like that. That mummy is 4,000 years old. She looks it. Come on. We've got to take a picture of that. Come on, follow me. Well, where is it? It was here. What do you mean it was here? It was here. Mummies can't walk. It must be around here someplace. The sacred medallion is missing. I'll search the infidel Doctor. You must hurry. Klaris has been too long without sustenance. If Klaris is gone, somebody moved him. It wasn't me. Then it's either Dr. Zoomer, or there's somebody in this house... who don't belong here. And I know who it is. Who? Me. Now wait a minute. Take this camera. You go and hide... and take a picture of anybody that comes in this room. And if there's anything fishy going on around here, we'll have the proof. I gotta take a picture of you. Stay right there. Now, would you mind smiling, please? Attaboy. Now, will you lean back? That coat's in your way. Hey. Hey, I found a dead body. Maybe it's the Doctor. Where is it? First the mummy disappears. Now a body disappears. The heat must be getting the best of you, boy. Go in the bathroom and soak your head. What's the matter? The body is in here. What body? The body that was supposed to be in there, is in here. Show me. Behind the door. Come on. I'm getting sick and tired of this. Why don't you do as I tell you? Go and hide! Hide. Hide. Yeah. Hide? Yeah. Hide. Abbott, I got him! Hey, Abbott! I got him. It's me. I am sorry. You're no good to me at all. Now go wait for me in the office. Get out of here. Get in the office. Get in the office! Dear friend, I suppose you are surprised... to hear the sound of my voice. You can say that again, brother. I thought you were dead. I have much to tell you. Okay, I'll sit down. Shall I call Abbott? This is for your ears alone. I won't call him. Yesterday, I found Klaris. Me, too. Today, I think I have the secret of the Princess Ara. I am giving the secret to you... in case something happens to me. I won't tell anybody. Everyone who has searched for Klaris has died. Oh. Now that I have found him... I fear the curse of Klaris. Is that why you hid in the closet and the bathroom? Past the pyramids, near the ruins of an old temple... is a large rock. Search there... and... And... Abby! What happened? Dr. Zoomer. He was talking to me, and then he went... He's right over here. Where is he? Dear friend, I suppose you are surprised... to hear the sound of my voice. I told you before I was surprised, Doc. Now come on. Get up off the floor and quit scaring me. He'll never scare anyone again. He's been murdered. Is this the man you saw in the closet? Yeah. Only thing is, he had some clothes on. We better call the police. But in case the body disappears... you better take a couple of pictures. I'll get him up. There you are. Go ahead, Lou. I searched the Doctor's clothes. The sacred medallion was not there. The wrath of Semu will be upon us... but we must face him. Wait a minute. Make a note on the back of one of the pictures... so the cops will know who it is. This is Dr. Zoomer. Signed, a friend. Perfect. Attaboy. All right, now. Go with me now. Now give that to me. Come on, let's get out of here. How many times did you shoot Dr. Zoomer? I shot the body three times and the head twice. Good. Come on, let's get out of here before anybody sees us. You know, instead of calling the cops... we'll send them these pictures. There's no need of us getting involved in this affair. Paper! Hey, boy. Take this down to the police, and here's a tip for you. Give him a tip. Thanks. Hustle along. Well, come on. You have done well. Let us celebrate the return of Klaris to his people. The sacred medallion, the secret of Princess Ara, where is it? The Doctor must have taken it. I searched but I failed. May the curse of Klaris be upon the one who has the medallion. Hetsut, Iben, return to that house and search again. If you do not find it, you must die. I've got to figure this out. Buddy, my boy, if you find the fellow who killed Dr. Zoomer... you've got the murderer. Hey, you've got something there... What makes you so dumb? I'll prove it with the lady. Lady! How dare you try to make a date with me? I work in the caf. I do my act. Nobody makes a date with me. I finish my act. So you think you're going to make a date with me? You think I'll tell you I live at... 42-42-54 Ruelle Padle, Apartment 2B? You think I'm going to tell you I am not married, I live by myself... and that my phone number is 23-41-648? Oh. Just because I work in the cafe, I do my act... And if you dare to follow me home... here's my card. Hey, wait a minute. What is this all about? No, lady. I don't think I can. No, lady, I can't. No, lady, I don't think I can. Hey, Abbott, what's she saying? Maybe I can. Oh. Lou, I'm surprised at you. Accepting a card from a perfect stranger, a lady... with her address and her telephone number on it. Give me that card. I'll get rid of it. Extra! Read all about it! Dr. Zoomer found murdered! Here you are, boy. I'll take one of those. There you are. You! What's the matter with him? He must have saw something. "The noted archeologist Dr. Gustav Zoomer was found murdered in his home... "and the famous mummy Klaris stolen. "The police expect to take the murderer into custody any minute... "thanks to some pictures sent by an anonymous friend. "For balance of story and photo, see Page 3." Hey, you know, those pictures that you took may solve this murder. I... Hey, look at these pictures you took. You took me with Dr. Zoomer. What have you got to say? Believe me, he looks better than you do. Why, you... Uh-oh. The kid is tipping off the cops. Let's see if there's a back way out of here. The newsboy said this gentleman was here. Which gentleman? The one that's alive. Which one is alive? The big one. Have you seen him? This has been a busy day. Perhaps. Perhaps not. Sit down and play your flute. Alms. Keep playing! Alms. Hey, you sit over here. Alms. Blow that thing. They're watching us. Stop blowing. What happened? You got me in enough trouble. Lay down. Do you think this is safe? We have no choice. If they didn't bring Klaris out, then he must still be in there... and so is the sacred medallion. We've got to get it before they come back. If they do come back, watch out for the baby-faced guy. He's a killer. He's probably the leader. We'll take no chances with him. Now they say that a murderer always returns to the scene of his crime. Now we're going inside. Turn on the recorder... and when the murderer hears Dr. Zoomer's voice... naturally, he's going to investigate. Then what do we do? Run. No! We grab him. Come on. Come on. Press the recorder for a playback. I'll look around. Should anyone come in, call me. Yeah. I'll tell you what I'll do. Hey, Bud, if anybody comes in, I'm gonna call you fast, because... He's here. Who? Behind me. That's your reflection! Look, why don't you be a man? Be brave! Be tough like me. Be tough like you? Be tough like me! Nothing scares me. Nothing scares me! Nothing scares me! Be brave. Be tough. Nothing scares me. I can't be tough. I would if I could. I'm gonna find out. This is a gun! And I'm gonna use it. Put your hands up or I'll fill you full of lead! Back up! Back up! Back up! I'm gonna see if I'm really tough now. This is a gun! And I'm gonna use it. Put your hands up or I'll fill you full of lead! Back up! Back up! Don't shoot. Please don't shoot. Hey, Buddy, it's me. Why, you... Now stop playing around. I've gotta clear myself of this murder rap. We'll search the trophy room. Hide. A lot of these old houses had secret doors and passages. When you knocked on anything... you never knew what would happen, or what you were going to find. Come in. Who are you talking to? Somebody knocking at the door. It's me knocking. Did you push me? Certainly not. You're imagining things again. What have you got there? It's a piggy bank. Piggy bank? Yep. Hey. What's that? Finders keepers. Charlie, Josef, get the medallion! Hey, there's no latch on the door. Come on, move this over. Keep pushing. Attaboy. Yes, sir. Help! Come on. Let's get out of here. Hold it! What are we gonna do now? Go over to that door. As soon as I give you the signal, open it up. Grab him. He's the murderer! Are you sure this is the murderer? We've been looking for a tall guy. That's his partner. This is the one who pulled the trigger. We heard him say he shot the body three times and the head twice. Phone for the patrol. This is a gun! And I'm gonna use it. Put your hands up or I'll fill you full of lead! Back up! Back up! Back up! Back up! He tricked us. At least I know where to look for the medallion. We'll search till we find him. Remember, he's dangerous. So am I. We have located the medallion. It is in the possession of a short, fat foreigner. Take it away from him. So you do not fail, I will go with you. You know, if all those people are after this gadget... there must be some connection between this and Dr. Zoomer's murder. Right? Right. Right. Now, there's only one way to find out if it's valuable. That's to try and hock it, right? Right. Come on. Here, it's too big. Come on, get in. Yes, gentlemen? What can I do for you? How much can we get on this? No! No! It is evil! It's a curse! Take it away! Protect me! Protect me from the curse of Klaris! It means death! Take it away! There's something wrong with him. Let's find another place. Are you two gentlemen the proprietors? No, we're customers. The proprietor left in a hurry. All we did was show him this... Take it away! Don't show it to me, please! Protect me! Protect me! Take it away! Don't let me look! Don't let me look! Protect me from the curse of Klaris, please! Ain't you scared? Well, of course not. It's only a valueless piece of costume jewelry. But, of course, if you need money... How much? Would $100 help you? You mean $100 for this? Well, no, it's not worth that, but... it would always remind me of you. Well, let's make the price $5,000 so you don't forget me. Even if I was willing to pay $5,000... it's too large an amount to carry around with me. Where do you want to make the payoff? Suppose we talk it over at the Cafe Bagdad at 6:00. The name is Madame Rontru. I'll be there. Good. I'll be there, too. I can hardly wait. $5,000. Oh, boy! I'll have to figure this thing out. $5,000 will take us to the States. Now I gotta figure out the fare. Let's see, a first-class ticket for me... third-class ticket for you. A new suit of clothes for me. Of course you'll have to have your shoes shined. I'll have to buy some expensive gifts to take home to the folks. You can send home a couple of postcards. Excuse me, I owe you a thousand apologies for my unwarranted behavior. I will buy the medallion. I'm sorry, we have another buyer. And she's prettier than you are. And tonight I'm gonna meet her at the Cafe Bagdad. Hetsut. Iben We'll wait for darkness. You came a long way from St. Louis You climbed the ladder of success I've seen the town and country cars that were parked out in front Of your fancy address You came a long way from St. Louis You broke a lot of hearts between I've met a gang of gloomy gals who were Doing all right till you came on the scene You blew in from the middle west and certainly impressed the population hereabouts But, honey, I've got news for you I'm from Missouri, too So naturally, I've got my doubts You've got them dropping by the wayside A feeling I ain't gonna know You came a long way from St. Louis But, baby, you still got a long way to go You blew in from the middle west And certainly impressed the population hereabouts But, honey, I've got news for you I'm from Missouri, too, and naturally, I've got my doubts You've got them dropping by the wayside A feeling I ain't gonna know You came a long way from St. Louis But, baby you still got a long way to go You've got a long way to go You got a long way to go No, you don't. Well, I don't see her. Maybe we're too early. Well, I've got enough money for hamburgers and coffee. And after we sell the medallion... we'll have steaks and potatoes. Come on, let's sit down. Waiter. Two hamburgers and two coffees, please. Yes, sir. Very well, sir. Hey, this is a good time to get the lowdown on that fake jewelry... before we make a deal with that dame. Waiter. Does this mean anything to you? It means death. Death to whoever holds it. Hey. You better get rid of that medallion. You heard what the waiter said: "It's death to whoever holds it. " Mmm-hmm. You know, Lou... I think it was the medallion that caused those characters to throw the knives at us. You're so right. Boy, am I glad I feel good. Flowers? Flowers. How much are those flowers? $1. How much are these? $1. I ain't got no money. No money? Uh-uh. They're a little wilted, you can have them for nothing. Sorry, sir. When you put the flower on my tray... you accidentally put this jewelry on it. Oh, no. I will bring the coffee later. Okay. Lou. Isn't that a beautiful girl over there? Abbott, I believe this girl over here is much prettier. Wait a minute. How can you compare this girl... with that gorgeous creature over there? Why, it's ridiculous. Just a minute. I still believe that that girl over there is much prettier. I still say that girl over there... is the prettiest girl in the place. Would you mind if I try yours? Sorry to have kept you waiting. I have a private dining room just for us. Well, that's mighty nice of you. Not you. I prefer to deal direct. Come, little man. You brought the medallion? May I see it? I see you want your money first. It's warm in here. Let me have your coat. I'll put some soft music on. What's the matter? Termites. You're seeing things. Come over here. Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. There, and I'll fix us some refreshments. Isn't that head a scary thing? You know, they say that animal devoured a man just before they shot it. And when they stuffed him, they forgot to pull the guy out. No, you don't. I'll take care of this. I'll hang it up myself, that way I'll know everything is... Give me this thing. Why are you leaving? Pickpockets. You must be mistaken. There's no one here but us. What about this guy over here? You see, it's only a statue. Apparently, you don't trust me. So here's your money. Thank you. Light? Yes. See how honest I am? Get out of here. I've had enough of this nonsense. Charlie! Josef! I want that medallion. Can't give it to you. Why not? I ate it. You ate it? With ketchup. The police have arrested Hetsut for the murder of Dr. Zoomer. Then they no longer blame the tall foreigner? Not after the autopsy. It showed the infidel Doctor died from a poisoned dart imbedded in his ear. So Hetsut put the noose around his own neck. Let him hang. What about the two that have the medallion? They were taken to the house of Dr. Azzui. In that case, I shall visit the Doctor. You may as well put away the gun. I will not help you. My dear Doctor, I spent many months as a nurse. I'm fully capable of handling either an X-ray or a fluoroscope. Take care of him, Charlie. Take off your coat and unbutton your shirt. Yes, ma'am. Please don't cut me up. Don't get excited. I just want to look at you... through the fluoroscope to see if you're telling the truth. Get behind there. No! Turn out the lights, Charlie. A marble, a couple of buttons, a safety pin... I lost a tie clasp two years ago. See if it's in there. Shut up. What are those letters of the alphabet? They're from the necklace Dr. Zoomer used to hold the medallion. Those letters don't prove he ate the medallion. The only way to find out is to cut him open. No. Maybe if you stand me on my head, it might fall out. That's an idea, but I've got a better one. Turn on the lights. Now what? Shake him up a bit. That's enough. Get behind there. Turn off the lights. Lights. Little man, if you've lied to me about that medallion, you'll regret it. Let's stop fooling and cut him open. No, don't. Shake me up once more. I know it's there. All right. Just once more, but that's final. You, help shake him up. If you think I'm gonna help shake up my pal... you're right. Grab his feet. Pick him up. Abbott! Don't let him get away. Grab the table. All right, get him down. What good is the x-ray? We can't read hieroglyphics. We'll get someone to translate them. I'll answer it. You stay here and watch them. I told you to watch those two men. What are you doing here? I came to warn you that someone else is after the medallion. Go in there with Charlie. I'm looking for two gentlemen. A pawnbroker friend of mine told me... they had a rare medallion to dispose of. If you'll tell me why you're interested in the medallion... I'll tell you whether or not they're here. As a student of archaeology, I am interested in any object... which deals with ancient history. Could you read hieroglyphics, Mister... Professor Semu. As I told you, I'm a student. I shall be happy to lend my humble assistance, Madame... Rontru. Wait here a minute, please. He says he can read the hieroglyphics. We've got to take a chance. I wouldn't trust him. Suppose he reads the secret and then disappears. That's exactly what I'm planning on. Here's an x-ray. The sacred medallion of Ara. What an extraordinary place to keep it. But a safe place. It would be difficult to steal it. Quite. However, the x-ray of the hieroglyphics reveals the way... to the untold wealth of Ara. "Past the pyramid... "near the ruins of an old temple, is a large rock. " With my knowledge of the desert, I could prove a valuable guide. For how much? I will leave that up to you. I'm sure you will be generous. When would you like to start our expedition? Before dawn. Meet me at the Cafe Bagdad. I will take two men to help us. Take the one who has the medallion. And if anything should happen to the x-ray, you can still get the medallion. Professor, you're a man after my own heart. How true. Good night, Madame. Josef. He will lead us to the treasure. You and Charlie follow, but keep out of sight. How much of a cut does he get? He's leaving that to my generosity. If he is a professor, he has a lot to learn. Semu approaches. Warn our people. We shall make camp here. This is the first step. Do you wish to continue? The reward is great enough for me to take the gamble. However, if you are afraid of the curse of Klaris... you can go back to town. If I were afraid, I would not be here. But a legend that has lasted over 4,000 years must have some truth. My dear Professor, some of the men I have met have acted like mummies... and others have certainly acted like they were 4,000 years old. But I have never met one I was afraid of. So why should I fear Klaris? It is said that Klaris never died. That he still lives and breathes. Kept alive over the centuries by his followers... so that he may guard the tomb of Princess Ara and her treasure. Surely, you're not trying to frighten me. I am only warning you. Now I must see if this place is as deserted as it appears. After you've finished unloading, pitch the tent over there. What's the matter with you? She's pretty. Who? That horse. That's a pretty white horse. Unload the stuff. Followers of Klaris... my search has ended. I have brought back the one who has the sacred medallion. And when we find the treasure, we'll melt down the gold and recut the jewels. And that mummy of Klaris, it might be worth something... if we could smuggle it out of the country. Whatever we find, we take. The only thing we'll leave behind will be the professor. What about those two idiots? They, too, are expendable. Two more infidels have arrived. So, two more mice come to nibble at the golden cheese. When will they die? After the feast of Klaris. Prepare for the celebration. All right. Pitch the tent. All right, Lou, here. Put your stakes here. Lou! Lou! Abbott, is that you? I will lead the infidels to the worship room. When the celebration of Klaris is ended, their lives will end with it. And so will the threat to the treasure of Princess Ara. You're always... Hey, Bud, hey, Bud, it's in there. I saw it. The mummy. We better tell Miss Rontru and the professor. Wait a minute. Why tell them? If we find the mummy, we'll make a fortune. Where is it? It's in there. Where will we find the mummy? Don't worry, the mummy will find you. Where is it? Inside, in the hole in the rock. Where's the hole in the rock? Here. There was a hole in the rock. Where? There's no hole in the rock! Hey, there was! Now this is no time to laugh. This is serious. Where's the hole in the rock? Here, give me a boot. I'll be, hey! Look! Come on, follow me. I have to get back before the professor suspects something. Was it wise to leave him out of your sight? Well, what did you expect me to do? Bring him here? This wouldn't be a bad place to get rid of him. I'll make the decisions. You just make sure you keep out of sight. And then he came out of here, and then he tried to choke me. You mean, the mummy is alive? Yeah. Well, a live mummy is worth more to us than a dead mummy. I'll tell you what to do. You sit here, I'll sit over there... and when the mummy comes out, and goes to choke you... I'll whistle like this. Then you grab him. How are you gonna whistle? I'll whistle like this. Never mind. Just a minute. I'll tell you what you do. I'll sit over there, you sit over here. When the mummy comes out to grab you, I'll... Like this, and you grab him. Mummy, you can come out now. What are you whistling for? I'm the one that's supposed to whistle. Hey, Abbott, where are you going? Have you seen the professor? The professor is not a professor. He's right in there with the whole gang. And he's gonna kill us, right after the celebration of Klaris. No wonder he had no trouble finding this place. Charlie! Josef! Where did they come from? We've been double-crossed. Semu is the leader of the followers of Klaris. He brought me here to kill me. So we kill him, before he kills you. Then we steal Klaris and get the treasure. Take these tools. Go behind those rocks and dig a hole. Somebody's gonna get buried. You fellows stand on either side of that opening. The professor has a surprise coming. Lou, this looks like a soft spot to dig. Here, I'll help you. Give me one of those implements. Here, take your pick. There. Wait. Hold it, that's a shovel. Here's the pick over here. Well, I picked the shovel. The shovel is my pick. No, this is a pick. This is a shovel. That is what I picked, is the shovel. How can the shovel be the pick? Look, if I had wanted a pick, I would've picked the pick. But instead, I picked the shovel, because the shovel is my pick. In other words, you don't want to pick the pick, because the pick is a pick... and a shovel isn't the pick of your pick, the pick... the pick, the shovel isn't the pick. Now you've got it. Now I got it. I don't even know... what I'm talking about. You still don't understand, do you? No. Here, look. Now you take your pick. There you are. Now the pick is your pick! Let's try it again now. Now, come on, you take your pick. You took the shovel! Here's the pick, over here! All right, please. Come on, dig a hole here. We're in enough trouble as it is, Lou. Now dig your hole there. You know, if we try to escape, we'll get lost on this desert. And if we stay here, we'll possibly wind up in that hole, instead of Semu. I don't know what to do. Something's got to be done. You can... Hey, a midget mummy! Go away! So, Lou. After all, there's an old saying: If you can't beat them, join them. That's what we'll do. We'll strike a bargain with Semu. After all, you've got the medallion. You got nothing to worry... Sure. Leaves me here to do all the work. You don't care who does it or how it's done. What have you found out, Professor? Follow me and I will show you. So you know who I am. Killing me will be of no avail. You cannot escape my followers. You're right. So we'll hold you as the hostage. Then we'll have something to bargain with. Hey, let's get out of here. Yeah. Will you stop playing around? If we get caught in here, we'll be killed. Can't make that. There must be another exit. What's that? Either Semu has changed plans, or something has happened. We must search until we find him. It stopped. I wonder where it came from? Here's an exit. Come on, Lou. Abbott! Charlie, you look like the real thing. Josef, go get Klaris. We'll dump him in here while Charlie takes his place. And you, Professor, are my hole card... in case some of your followers get in the game. Let's find Semu and see if he'll exchange our lives for the medallion. No, it's too late. Why? When I saw the mummy, I got scared so I coughed it up. He's got it. Oh, no! What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of this? Ask Klaris. He got us into this. And he's gonna get us out. I know how to get in good with Semu. I'll bury him in. You take his place. It's moving. It isn't now. Come on, let's get him. We'll take Klaris out and bury him so those crooks can't steal him. Then I'll come back and take his place. Have you decided to disclose the secret of Ara's treasure? Whether you talk or not, you're still our passport back to Cairo. I'll take the detector. You bring the explosives. There. Throw him in there, and cover him up so he can't be seen. Hey, boy! Are we in luck! There's enough bandages here to make me look like Klaris. Get a load of this. Let's get out of here. I don't think I hit him hard enough. It's the Professor! Help me lift him up. Set him down. What do I do now? Untie him! As soon as we have a chance to get in good with him, you spoil it. Take my hand, and we'll still try to save the treasure. Come on, Charlie. We've located it. He's not here. What do you suppose happened to him? I don't know, but we're not waiting. Look, we've better find a place to hide. Come on. Hey, Abbott, what are you... Come on, Costello. The coast is clear. Hurry up! No, don't try to scare me, Lou. Maybe there is something to this curse of Klaris. Charlie disappears and... You've stalled long enough. Either light the fuse, or I will. Have you got a match? Get that torch. Costello! Costello! Charlie! Stand where you are! Three of them. Which one of you is Charlie? Step forward, raise your hand. We must hurry. Even now we may be too late to save the treasure of Ara. Klaris! You will destroy us and the temple. Back up! Hey, where have you been? Hey! I was thinking about leaving. Get rid of it! Here you are.
