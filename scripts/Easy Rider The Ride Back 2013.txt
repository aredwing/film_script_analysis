Day after Mardi Gras, 1969, Wyatt and his best friend, Billy, were riding their bikes heading for Florida. The sky was crystal blue, just like 911. Wyatt died that day, the victim of hatred and prejudice, at the hands of those whose greatest fear is freedom, whether in the form of a nation or a single individual. Finally making the ride back after 40 years. Time to face the ghosts of the past. And all because little sister Shane... showed up at my island off the coast of Mexico. If there's one thing I hate in life, it's fucking surprises. Well, I see some things never change. No, I guess not. Here you are again, uninvited and unannounced. What brings you all this way? I forgot how beautiful it is up here. I was looking around thinking no man's an island, but you just keep giving it your best shot, don't you? You didn't answer my question. Wow. Look at your collection. Pretty cool shit, huh? It's amazing. You really should market this in the States. You know better than anybody... one of a kind. Oh, wow. I love this. Take it. It's yours. I couldn't do that. No, take it. Stop. I saw Paulina by the pool. She looked like a goddess floating there. I didn't want to disturb her, but I cannot wait to spend time with her and the girls. Think they still remember you? Oh, you can sit up here like the king of your castle and chastise me, but I don't remember you ever coming to see Cody and I in... I don't know... never. Hey, you know why. Whose fault is that? You know what I think? I think you ought to take a hit of this and loosen up a bit. I'd rather have a drink. Cool jackets. Yeah, this is my scarlet cross jacket, and that's the jacket I made for Wyatt. How did it get here? I brought it back with his belt... and what was left of the motorcycle that Virgil built for him... after we identified his body. Virgil and I weren't that close growing up. Way too much the boy scout. Wyatt... He was my idol. You should have seen him ride. After Wyatt's murder, Virgil and I got majorly tight. He was just here a couple of weeks ago with Wes Coast. Wes Coast was here? Yeah. Wes was here. Can't believe it. I hear you're going out on the circuit. Baby, I got to finish this bike or my dad's gonna kill me. I need to know. We need to talk about this. You wanna talk about it? You need to know? Yeah. Mmm. Mmm! How is he? Crazy as ever. Said you and he were an item once upon a time. That was a long time ago. Forgot something? I wish Shane had ended up with Wes... instead of that rich asshole she married. I'd probably see a lot more of her. El Seor Torre is expecting you. I can take you there. Old friend. Morgan, mi amigo. Quieres un poco? No, no. Not my thing. Bastian, if you please. Yes, sir. What's this? - Don't you recognize it? - Oh, I recognize it. Just should have been a lot bigger. That's all. Oh, come on, Morgan. Take it easy. Ooh! Wow! Oh! Looks like I missed something. Yes, you did. I guess I missed something too. How's your friend? Uh, not so well tonight. Well, then I guess I don't have to ask what's in here. Jesus, Morgan. How much is in here? Not enough. Shane, it's only pot. Only thing I've ever done. Only thing I'm ever gonna do. When are you gonna grow up? If I'm lucky, never. Uh, nothing else. Hold the table. We'll be back. Let's take a walk. Shane was freaked that I was dealing. And to make matters worse, she thought Wyatt died over drugs. But I got her straightened out on that... and some other family history too. Yeah, well, you know, you were too young to remember it, but after Mama died, we were all lost. And Wyatt... He tried to find himself by splitting to L.A. Did a lot of crazy shit out there. Like what? Well, like stunt riding in the movies. An Evel Knievel carny act. There was a new breed out there back then... snorting coke, smoking dope. And Wyatt decided, well, maybe he'll help supply the demand... and he started dealing drugs. First he was dealing pot for me, but then he wanted to make the big score... cocaine, early retirement. So I hooked him up with a guy down in Ensenada. He did the deal. But, of course, he didn't live to enjoy it. Thank God Daddy doesn't know any of this, because I don't think he could bear to have... What? Two sons like me? Is that what you were gonna say? That's what you were gonna say, wasn't it? No. That's not what I meant. Well, it is what you meant, and that's okay, 'cause I got really good at keeping this family's dirty little secrets in check. And only Virgil and me know about this. Oh! Numbs the pain, now, doesn't it? You know Daddy's living with us now, and I'm throwing him a little surprise birthday party. Of course you are. What? You always have a hidden agenda, don't you? Haven't heard from you since Francesca was born, and here you are. Morgan, Daddy isn't gonna be around much longer. This has to stop. You need to be there. The last thing he wants to see after all this time is my ass. Why do you two still hate each other after all these years? It's ridiculous. 'Cause maybe, Shane, hate isn't the opposite of love. It's the frustration of love. Can't you just make the first move, let bygones be bygones? Let me tell you something. He didn't like the way I expressed my freedom back then, and he's not gonna like it any better now. Hey. What's wrong? I have to do this. Stashing the cash in the tank... family tradition. Did I stay too long in the cold? Did I miss the day he grew old? Can I return to the fold? Is the distance still the same I heard the dove in the peaceful sky He heard the hawk raise a battle cry But the time has run and the prodigal son returns Let the eagle fly Let the banner wave Over the son of the land of the free And the father Of the home of the brave I heard a peaceful song He heard his country right a wrong He said, "Son, I risked my life So that you could be free" If there is room in a perfect sky When the sun and the moon don't see eye to eye And the prodigal son with no alibi returns Let the eagle fly Let the eagle fly Let the banner wave Over the son of the land of the free And the father Of the home of the brave Land of the free Yeah! Push in there! Whoo! Yeah! All right! What's wrong with that turn, man? You guys are flying like eagles. I just want you to charge into that wood a little stronger. I'll tell you what. You cats take a little rest, and you watch the big dog fly! Jesus Christ! I thought I saw a ghost! I don't know what the hell you're doing here, brother! You better be ready to drink some whiskey, boy! Yee-ha! I love your racing school, man. They love the big dog! Crashing in the corner. Must've totally impressed the hell out of 'em. Kiss my ass, huh? A long time, bro! Ahh! Nice ride. Awesome, man! I fucking love it! There you go. Got a nitro kick and a gypsy tattoo I got a place where we can go look at some tits. Ahh! She flirts, spins, flexing every Saturday night Yee-ha! I'm Wes... Coast Smooth. With the profile tires and the Second Look bags With a two-love bench But just for a while 'Cause there ain't nobody gonna cramp my style Oh, yeah! 'Cause I'm Wes - Hey! - Coast Some food. Yeah! Smoke! Drink! And fuck! Yee-ha! So come on, baby Said don't be shy Wes Coast is in the house! You goddamn right he is, baby! - What'll it be, Wes? - Whiskey, darlin'. Whiskey. I'm Wes... Coast Ha-ha Here's to Mexican bike trash in the middle of the border. Here's to it. I didn't think I'll see you so soon. What's up? It's a bit of a long story. It all started when Pop went to live with Shane. Watch your step. Okay. Ward, Pop's here. How you doing there, Wild Bill? Pop, your bedroom's the first door on the right. Why don't you get him settled? I'll be right in. You're unbelievable. Why can't you just be nice? Is that so difficult? Mm-hmm. So this is my prison cell, huh? Pop, it's not gonna be that bad. I'm not setting one goddamn foot on this floor till I get my flag. You got it. Whew. Well, I knew Wild Bill wouldn't like being uprooted like that. Well, you got that right. She decided to come down and pay me a visit. And you took the bait. Yeah. The girl's not easy to resist, huh? No. Not easy at all. Not at all. How's she doing? Tough read. But she sure as hell reacted when she heard your name. Tried like hell not to show it though. Yeah. Well... What? How's she looking? Well, why don't you come and just check her out for yourself? Yeah. I said the things that a young man would say And I had more to learn than I could imagine 'Cause something made me feel it Was everybody's fault but my own Can we try One more time? Yeah! Well, I remember how she used to look. Ooh! Hi, baby. Yeah, baby, give me some sugar. Come here, darlin'. Get off of me, you fucking pig! What's your problem, bitch? What are you looking at, asshole? Here we fucking go again. Ohh! Hit him! Yeah! Oh! Aw, shit. - Yeah! - Ohh! Yeah! That bottle gonna fuck him up! Yeah! - Oh, man! - Didn't break. - Always breaks in movies. - Time to go. Yeah. Take it outside, boys. Take it outside. Sorry, baby. Keep dancin', baby. It's all good. You know, man, I knew I could count on you for some good shit. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I was thinking... I mean, with all this and all that... and all of this, we could be staying in a motel if we wanted, you know. Hell, we could take a plane to where we're going. But would you trade all this for more freedom? But it's 150 years ago, and those are horses. We're sitting out here. I was thinking about that. Yeah, I'd like to take that trip. Well, I know what you mean about time, man. Back then when it seemed like there was just so much more freedom. You know, Wyatt was about that whenever he climbed on that motorcycle. Put on his spurs, he was a cowboy. A lot of time's gone by. Way too little to come, and we got to be doing that, man. We got to be doing more of this. Yeah, it's good to be here. You know, it took me a long time... to, uh, decide to make this ride back to see the old man. I'm also kind of making this ride in memory of Wyatt. Wearing his shit, riding his bike. And that's why it's so cool that it's happening with you, because you've always been one of the family. Don't do it. Get down. Get down. Hey, Shane! Come quickly! Quickly! I didn't know what else to do, seora. Es loco. It's okay. Daddy's probably just having one of his spells. He's been doing this for as long as I can remember. We just have to wake him up. Daddy. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Good morning. Yeah. What's so good about it? There you go. Where's Roxette? It's Rosa, Pop. And I gave her a couple of days off to be with her family in Phoenix. With Cody in Iraq and Ward traveling, I thought we could spend some quality time together. Quality time, huh? Yeah. It was you that left Virgil and me for that life of leisure, that fancy art career, those four houses. When was the last time you hopped on that fancy jet of yours... that you fly all around and come see us, hmm? Not enough, Pop. But I'm here now. Hmm. If you'll excuse me, I have some things to do. You don't need my permission! It's your house! In the late '70s, Wesley Costero became Wes Coast, factory-sponsored motorcycle racer. Wes had a teammate, Reger Reynolds, and they were bitter rivals. In 1980, Wes won the world championship. Reger was a close second. Later that year, he was diagnosed with cancer and given only a few months to live. Reger beat the cancer, and Wes was with him every day around the clock. Since then, Reger's been giving back, and I can't wait to meet him. Yee-ha! Wes Coast. Come on in! Coryville... I should've had you. Saddleback. I would've... till I crashed on the last lap. And the big one... L.A. Coliseum. That was mine. That was mine. But no, what'd I do? Stayed up all night, partying like a rock star. With those three hot chicks. I was so fucked up the next morning. I stumbled over my own balls while trying to get on the bike. That's the truth. But you know what, Coast? There is one thing I'll always beat you at, and that's cooking. Hey, man. Hope you brought your appetite. Oh, I'm plenty hungry. And speaking of hungry... What you been doing to feed these homeless people, it's just... Thanks. Well, I'm bummin', man. Bummin' big time. Traveling kitchen ain't traveling. Transmission's blown. Piece of shit. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I don't know what I'm gonna do. You know what? I think maybe I can help you with that. Aw, man. What the hell? Just a little something for the cause. Cowboy. How much is in here? Oh, there's enough. Aw, yeah! All right, there you go, sir. Wow. I love this man. Pop, don't you want a jacket? No. It's really beautiful, isn't it? Yeah. It ain't home, if that's what you're asking. I didn't say it was. Your mama would roll over in her grave if she knew you had me here. I think Mama knows I'm doing the best I know how. That includin' holding a man against his will? Pop, I'm... That's it, huh? Why don't you just pull the trigger and get it over with? That's enough. That is enough for one day. Oh, no, baby girl. I'm just gettin' started. No. No, you are not. You wanna know why not? I'll tell you why. Because your beloved Virgil, your favorite son, he couldn't deal with you anymore, Pop. He couldn't handle you. I'm the only one that would have you. So you wanna sit here and just be all angry and mad at the world, you just go right ahead. Because at the end of the day, it's just you and me. And I swear, if you wanna push me away too, you just go right ahead. Sit there and be your old stubborn damn fool. It'll save us both a lot of time and aggravation! It's simple, man. Some wars are necessary. Some aren't. I don't know enough about any of that to even talk about it, and I sure as hell don't believe in any shit I hear on the news. Isn't it about time you got your damn troops... out of the Middle East? You can attack the war, man, but never the warrior. Hey, uh, Reger wanted me to come over here... and see if you guys needed anything. Maybe you can tell me where a couple tired old men can score a little reefer. Oh. Reefer. Well, around here we call it pot. Pot. Yeah, I can score it, but I don't have it with me. Whew. Why don't you just jump on the back of my bike and you can show us where it's at. Oh, I got a bike. And it's a beauty. She put everything she knew in the rearview Everything she owned on her back She took 72 out of Springfield And she never looked back Sometimes it got hot as hell in the desert And just as cold as hell at night But she kept riding into the sunset It was the only thing that felt right Cadillac cowgirl Keep on ridin' to the setting sun, all alone Cadillac cowgirl Keep on riding Don't turn around Don't go home Girl, don't go home Keep on riding Girl, don't go home Hi. Hello. - Oh, thanks for coming. - Well, thanks for asking me. It's so nice to meet you after all this time. Well, nice to meet you. Pop, there's somebody here to see you. Hello, Hickcock. Nobody's called me that since my sweet Anne died. She put you up to this, Stonewall. Well, she might've started the ball rollin', but, man, we're way long overdue for a visit. Good to see you again. What's it been, uh, 60 years? Last time I saw you, it was the day they shipped me back from the war. Well, I wrote you a few letters. I guess you never got 'em. Hell, I should've written more. You know how it is. Life has a funny way of taking over. You're gonna have to excuse me, Stonewall, but I'm not feeling too good these days. I'm really not up to having visitors. Shane knows that. I'd like to go to my room now. But, Dad, Andrew came all this way to see you. I'll do it myself. Dad... It's okay. The man is right. He should get his rest. I'll be right back. Okay. What are you running from? Well, you got her purrin' yet there, Wild Bill? Hey, it's your lucky day. Jarmon wants to see you. Sergeant Williams reporting as ordered, sir. I'm gonna send you on an important mission, Sergeant. Yes, sir. Whoa. Hey, hey now. Huh. Thought I lost you there. Just take it easy, okay? Your leg's all messed up. Is it still there? Hell, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A pretty nasty gash though. Some other cuts we need to clean up. You're one lucky son of a bitch. That bike saved your life. Shielded you from the blast. Thanks, Stonewall. I'd always wanted to check out the Salton Sea. Greatest ecological disaster in the history of California. While Wes kicked back, I decided to have a better look around. O beautiful For spacious skies For amber waves of grain For purple mountain Majesties Above the fruited plain America America God shed his grace On thee And crown thy good We've really blown it, man. Got to start taking better care of this planet. From sea to shining sea From sea to shining Sea We started the clinic, and over the years we've helped hundreds of Hopis. I should talk to Ward about a donation. Afternoon, Pop. I asked Andrew to stay for lunch before leaving. I figured it was the least I could do... since I invited him for a visit. Shane tells me that you went back to Springfield after the war... and kick-started your life. Yeah. Born and raised there. And ought to die there too. See, my daddy was a farmer. Golden Guernseys and corn... only life he ever knew. It's not just any man can live off the land. If you're not careful, it'll take as much as it gives. Daddy died when I was in high school. And shortly after that, I was off to the war. Well, who ran the farm while you were gone? Mama and Anne did. I don't know how they did it, but... they did. If it wasn't for them, that farm would've gone under for sure. Coming home from the war was the happiest day of my life. Oh. Oh! Bill! Oh! I missed you. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm so sorry I touched your scar. No. I just had a bad dream. That's it. Come here. Anne always believed God brought me home safe for a reason. I knew the reason. To help other vets. And one vet I'll never forget... Jake Connor. Can I help you? Yes, ma'am. I was wondering if this might be the home of Jake Connor. Yes, it is. Ma'am, my name is Hickcock Williams, and I wanted to bring these here groceries by for you and your family. Well, that's real nice, Mr... Williams, ma'am. Mr. Williams, that's a real nice offer, but Jake wouldn't cotton to us taking any charity. Oh, no, no, no. It ain't charity. I, uh... I was wondering if I could trade these here groceries... for the name of the person who made this flag for you. - That flag? - Yes, ma'am. It's the prettiest rendition of our Stars and Stripes I've ever seen. So, what, do you think your husband will go for it? Maybe. Especially seeing he's the one who made it. He made it? Jake? Honey, I got a visitor here for you. Mr. Connor? Mr. Connor, my name is Hickcock Williams. I'm a friend of your cousin's. I, uh... I brought some supplies by for you and your missus. But before you go jumping to conclusions, I'm here to tell you it ain't charity. Uh... Uh, I saw the flag you made over there. It's a thing of beauty. Your wife tells me you were a master tailor before the war. And, uh... See, I was wondering if I could interest you in a job. I'm willing to pay cash money for it. Well, maybe it's best we call it good for one day. We appreciate everything you're trying to do. Yes, ma'am. I understand. Hey, Jake. You wanna go for a ride? Hey, what's going on? Anne, what's wrong? It's okay. Just a little tired is all. Look, I'm sorry. I should've been home sooner. I know this is a lot for you and Mama to handle right now. I was thinking maybe we could use a little help around here. Sweetie, we talked about this. Okay? We can't afford to bring on another hand right now. And I guess that leaves us with plan B. - Plan B? - Yeah. 'Cause in about seven more months, there's gonna be another little farmer in the making running around here. Are you saying... Yes. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Yeah, we had Virgil in '44, Wyatt in '45. Mama passed away three years later, and Morgan, he came two days before New Year's in 1949. Well, that's pretty much it for the '40s. Well, I won't say things were perfect. I'll give you that. But for me, life was just about as good as it's ever gonna get. Announcer ] When the kids were little, they'd listened to a thing or two you had to say. Robinson dashes for the plate. It's close. And umpire Summers calls him safe. Yea! But Yogi Berra doesn't think so. Perseverance, boys. Perseverance. Jackie Robinson is someone who has it. He might be colored, but you can learn a lot from him. If you work hard and you never give up, eventually you'll get there. And even if you don't, as long as you've done your best, that's all anybody can do. See, Jackie was the first colored man... to play baseball in the major leagues. What's the color of his skin got to do with how he hits a baseball? Nothing, Son. I guess that's the point. That's why Jackie never gave up. And these Dodgers, at last, are world champions. But that was another America... Wyatt, now help Morgan. Right, right. Virgil, here. Here's your throttle. You wanna ease on the throttle. When family time was spent outdoors, not in front of a damn TV. And a person's wealth was measured in happiness, not by the size of their wallet. And the words "God," "love," and "country" meant something. Then came the '60s. And, well, that was the beginning of the end for the Williams family. You know, Wyatt marched to the beat of a different drummer than Virgil, and Morgan wanted to be just like Wyatt. Of course Morgan turned out even worse. A goddamn hippie... and a gutless one at that. But Wyatt sure loved his mama. He was the first to see it coming. Say, that's one hell of a motorcycle you got there. Yeah, man, it's a Harley. Chrome frame, '49 Panhead. Modified rake. It's all the shit. Harley's the best. Fuck the rest. Aw, yeah. One of these days I'm gonna take this baby somewhere far away from here. You're leavin'? Yeah, like, maybe head out to California and join a club or something. As soon as I can save up some money, and Mama's all right. Is your mama sick? Well, it's not... It's not like she has cancer or anything. It's just... Every since my little sister was born, she's... she's not really the same. Well, what does your pop and Virgil say about it? Not a goddamn thing. Pops can't be bothered. Virgil's off collecting merit badges. Bet he's probably on his way home right now to help with the chores. Ma, I'm home. It's okay, baby. It's okay. Shh. Mom! Wyatt forgot to bring the horses in again! I know, baby. I know. I know. It's okay. It's okay. Mama? "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest"... Nobody knew anything about postpartum depression... in those days. The boys loved her fiercely. So did I. Wyatt... he took it the hardest. He left home before the funeral. Hell, none of us really knew how to handle it. Virgil and Morgan did their best to help me with Shane, but... none of us were a substitute for a good mama. Amazing Grace Do-do-do How sweet the sound That saved a wretch Like me I once was lost But now I'm found Was blind But now I can see One thing that's always haunted me about that day. Last thing I remember seein' was Wyatt... all by himself in the cemetery before the funeral. I knew Wyatt was gonna leave before the funeral. I didn't stop him. I just let him go. Figured he'd come back. But he never did. I always wondered that if I'd stopped him right then and there... if he'd have died the way he did all those years later. I blame myself sometime. It wasn't your fault. You did the best you could, Pop. You turned out to be the best damn good-lookin' tomboy I ever saw. She got that from her mama. I'm gonna make us some tea. So, uh, Virgil and Morgan hung in there with you on the homestead. Well, not exactly. Virgil... his story's a bit more complicated than that. Bein' the oldest, Virgil was the most serious of the bunch. And fiercely competitive. Ready! Come on! Faster, faster, faster! Vanessa Monteague lived in a big mansion on the north side of town. Her family'd made their fortune with the railroads in the 1800s. Ooh, look. There's that Williams kid. Not so loud! I see him. Swing, batter, batter, batter, swing! Strike him out. Strike him out. Get him... Go say something to him. Like what? I don't know. Congratulate him or something. For what? Kicking our ass? Hey, kid, you played a hell of a game out there today. Thank you, sir. Keep this up, we'll see you in the big leagues soon. I hope so, sir. I like the kid. Hey, good game, guys. Good game. Hi. Hi. Vanessa Monteague. Uh, Virgil Williams. So I guess North's loss was bittersweet. Uh, what do you mean? I mean you should call me. Yeah, sure. You bet. You bet. When it came to any challenge in life, the boy hated to lose. Even in affairs of the heart. You shouldn't be here. I know. I know. But tonight's the big game. I still can't believe you're not coming. I don't understand why you don't just tell your old man about us. Yeah, right. If your parents don't have a six-figure bank account, then you're not exactly courting material in their eyes. Yeah. All that's gonna change real soon. Next month I'm gonna graduate. I'm gonna sign a pro contract. Then you and me are outta here. Forget your parents. I know. But until then, you've got to keep a low profile. Okay? That includes riding up here on this rocket of yours. I needed a kiss... for good luck. Mmm. Look, you know I'd be there tonight if I could. I know how much this means to you. But I've got to go to this dance with Winston. It's over by 10:00 though. Why don't you come pick me up at midnight? My parents will be in bed by then. Oh, shit. Here comes my mother. Get out of here. I'll be by at midnight. Be ready. Hey, Mom. Is that one of the Williams boys? Yes, Mother. What's he doin' here? There are other people in the world besides the ones at the club... and the little socialite dinners you have. Don't you take that tone of voice with me. I am your mother, and I have a right to be curious. You know how your father and I feel about white trash. He's just a guy I know. We're just friends. Besides, you know I'm dating Winston. We're going to the dance tonight, remember? Good. He's from the right kind of stock. You know, your father would blow a gasket... if he thought you were consorting with the wrong kind of element. Hmm. Where was it you grew up again, Mother? - Yeah, young love. - Yeah. Whatever ended up happenin' to the two of 'em? Well, fate. She stood him up. Never showed. A few weeks later he made me a proud papa. Joined the army right out of high school and started a military career. Vietnam? Two tours. - Ah, thank you, Shane. - I believe I'll pass. Six times done wore me out. - Do you wanna lie down, Pop? - Oh, yeah. That'd be good for a while. Oh, hey, you know, I should hit the road. Oh, nonsense. I said I was takin' a nap, not dyin'. Stay for supper. Yes. Please do. I'm not the greatest cook in the world, but I'll whip up something after chores. Andy, why don't you come down to the stables with me to feed the horses? That's a good idea. Make the old codger work for his dinner. Hey. I'm still a pretty good chore boy. I bet you are. My God. I haven't seen one of these since the war. It's for Pop's birthday. Cody finished restoring it before he went overseas. Brings back a lot of memories. But Pop doesn't know about it. My lips are sealed. Good. Whoa, whoa. Uh, I'll get that for you. Hang on. Okay. I got it. I got it. Thank you. So tell me. Is there a Mrs. Andrew Jackson Bennett floating around out there? In name only. After 30 years of marriage, we went our separate ways a few years ago. I'm sorry. No, no. We're still good friends. Uh, we just weren't making it as a couple. The "she has her own life and I have mine" philosophy... just didn't work anymore. I understand. Oh, boy. What happened? All the lights go out in Paris? Oh, that's funny. What brings you here? I just want to talk to my son. I just want you to know that I'll be damned if I'm gonna let you enlist in the army... Excuse me! and go off and get yourself killed. Dad, I've talked to a lot of people about this. Ward... - You mind? I'm talkin' to him. - Yes, I do mind! You've talked to some people about this? How dare you. You know what you're getting into? What people have you talked to? Your warmonger grandfather? Virgil, the Vietnam burnout? That is enough! Those are the people you're talking about? I made up my mind. You're my son, and I don't want you to go off and get yourself killed! That is not your choice. It's his. Would you shut up? Let me talk to my son! I will not shut up! You have no right to be here! If Cody wants to follow in that tradition, I will support him. He's twice the man you'll ever be. Oh, fine. Go to Iraq. Shane? I lost you there for a moment. You okay? Yes. Somethin' about that girl got a hold on me Somethin' about the way she made me feel But there's somethin' about this road That makes me free It makes me want to try to find a way To turn these wheels back around Somethin' about these nights In strange little towns There's somethin' about the lonesome highway sounds But here I go again Like so many times before Drivin' down this road No way to turn my wheels back around Ohh Down this road Are the years past Down this road Still lie the reasons I thought we could never return It's not for the weak of heart Not for the easy rider But the ride back is the only way To go home To go home To go home He breezed through basic and was immediately selected for Special Forces training. In 1967, Virgil was home on leave. And this Special Forces captain shows up, needs Virgil to deal with a V.C. sniper. Boy could always shoot. Sarge, we're comin' up on your D.Z. We go silent from here on in. Boys are sayin' that motherfucker's been causing a lot of havoc down there. Do us all a favor. Frag his ass. Move! One, two, three. Oh, shit. Fuck! Halt. Halt! Stay the fuck down, goddamn it. I can make it. I can make it. Cover me. Move, goddamn it. You are not fuckin' dying today. Virgil moved back to Springfield after the war? Yeah. Still races motorcycles every Friday night at the fairgrounds. And the girl? She married a man named Winston Caruthers. His family's big, high muckety-mucks in the bankin' world. Virgil's never cared for another woman since then. Not that I know of. Broke his heart. Now, I'm not gonna lie to you and tell you 'Nam didn't change him. I'd rather have a changed son any day than a yellow one. Get outta here! - What do you want? - This came for you in the mail. Beat it! "Greetings from the president. Dear Mr. Morgan Wiliams, by the authority of the United States government, you are hereby ordered to appear before the Ohio Local Board number 103... For active duty. Failure to do so may result in fines and/or imprisonment. " Yeah. All right! And fuck you too, Mr. President. Hell, no! We won't go! Hell, no! We won't go! Hell, no! We won't go! Hell, no! Virgil's over in Vietnam, and you... you don't even have the guts to fight with him! Get the... Get the hell off my property! Did you ever forget about, "I may not agree with what you're saying, but I'll fight to the death for your right to say it?" A traitor like you has no right to quote a great patriot. Get the hell outta here. Okay. Come here. - One man's traitor is another man's patriot. - You're no son of mine. Don't worry about it. I'm outta here. Okay. Come here, baby. Fuck you and fuck your war and fuck your goddamn country! Morgan turned yellow. He... left. Went to Mexico. A lot of young men did that. Yeah, well, as far as I'm concerned, good riddance. See this? That's a symbol of the motorcycle club I started. I got it after the kids were born. But it's more than that. Hey. Take it easy. Take it easy. The red cross on my medic satchel. Yes. Thank you, Stonewall. It's gettin' late. Now, I gotta go, and I mean it this time. Shane's got a hundred bedrooms in this place. Come on. Spend the night. We'll celebrate my birthday tomorrow in grand style. Pop's right. It wouldn't be the same without you. Hell, besides Shane, Cody and Virgil, you're just about the only family I got left. Fact, if you don't stay, I'd consider it an insult. Virgil's comin' in the morning. I'd love for you to meet him. Well, hell, Hickcock. When you put it that way, how can I refuse? Exactly. Yes, sir. Shane. Sometimes people say things they don't mean. - Good night, Pop. - Good night, sweetie. You ever regret splittin' to Mexico? You know, man, I think of that every now and then. Things are always a lot clearer lookin' back. Yeah. You think your old man knows that Virgil told you not to go to 'Nam? Hell, no. There's a lot about what went down back then... that the old man don't know. He didn't know the real reason that Virgil enlisted. It was that chick, right? Yeah. It was that chick. But not the way most people thought. There'll never be anyone else but you For me Never ever be, just couldn't be anyone else but you If I could take my pick of all the girls I've ever known Then I'd come pick you out To be my very own There'll never be anyone else but you For me Never ever be, just couldn't be anyone else but you A heart that's true and longs for you Is all I have to give All my love belongs to you As long as I may live There'll never be anyone else but you For me Never ever be, just couldn't be anyone else but you I never will forget the way you kissed me And when we're not together I wonder if you miss me 'Cause I hope and pray the day will come When you'll belong to me 'Cause then I'm gonna prove to you How true my love can be There'll never be anyone else but you For me Never ever be, just couldn't be anyone else but you Well, this is it. This is so beautiful. Yeah, come on. Come on. Everything you've done is so beautiful. Not half as beautiful as you are. Why, Virgil Williams, I bet you jocks say that to all the girls. Ohh. Only the ones they like. Wait. It's okay. Kiss me. What are you gonna do? Just stay here. Hey, fellas. Boo! Well, what... do... we have... here? Looks like we got a couple of trespassers. Look, we didn't realize this was private property, okay? "We didn't know this was private property. " "We're sorry. " Well, I tell you what. Are you listenin' to me? Don't let us bother you. Look, we're gonna get our things and go. Okay? We'll gladly get our things and just leave. You may have started the party, old boy, but we damn sure are gonna finish it. I heard that. Virgil! No! Virgil, please! Virgil, please help me! Get off of me! Virgil! Virgil! Oh, shit, man. I think you popped her cherry. Let's not forget about pretty boy. Unbelievable. Virgil was never gonna let something like that happen... to somebody he loved ever again. What do you mean? The man who returned from Vietnam was nothing like the boy who left. I remember you Just like yesterday I had a young man's dream You took it away It's your turn now It's your turn now Pick your poison. What'll it be? - You know a guy named Emil? - Yeah. Who wants to know? Well, we're old acquaintances. Me and him used to be real close. Yeah, he's right over there. You want me to go get him? No, don't get him. I'd like to buy him a drink. - Sure. What'll it be? - Bloody Mary. No problem. I'll get you two of 'em at that price. Thanks. Baby, are you gonna sit around and play cards all night, or are you gonna go outside and fuck me? All right, Linc. I call. I got a pair of 10s. Three of a kind. This ain't your night, man. - What the fuck is this? - Free drink. Some guy over at the bar bought it for you. - Well, go get him. - Hey, dude, I would if I could. Paid for it and took off. He don't know me too good. I don't drink this shit. Go sell this fuckin' thing to someone else and bring me the money. I'm losin' my ass tonight. Move your ass. I gotta go piss. I'm watchin' you. I'm watchin' you. When I look in your eyes, I see death disguised I see a young girl's heart torn apart Emil? Yeah? Guess you won't be poppin' any more cherries. It's your turn Your turn now I always knew he had a dark side to him. Yeah. Well, now you know why. You know, man, I'm gonna crash. So, Wesley Costero... Hey, man, don't call me that. Wes Coast. You gonna finish what you started? - The ride. - Shane. I love you, Wes. You didn't say it. Come on. I want to hear you say it. Did I stay too long in the cold? Did I miss the day he grew old? Can I return to the fold? Will it feel the same? Let the eagle fly Let the banner wave Over the land of the free And the home of the brave Home of the brave We gonna do this? Yeah. You just go ahead. I'll... I'll be along. Oh. Thank you, God. Oh. Oh. I knew you'd come. I knew it. Didn't know myself until a couple of minutes ago. Oh, thank you, Morgan. Still wearing my necklace, I see. Of course. So, uh, where's the old man? Sleeping. I was just about to wake him up. I'll do it. Okay. Is he still havin' those nightmares? - You know it. - Well, I guess I'll just be another one. Stop. Which way? First door on the right. I said the things that a young man would say Hello, Shane. Something made me feel it was everybody's fault but my own Wes? You look pretty good, baby. Can we try one more time? I saw it all through a young man's eyes Wyatt? I saw it all as though I had forever So I went down that road... No, Pop. It's me... Morgan. But I came back to find Might you feel The same way too? - Been a long, long time. - Not long enough. You got a lot of nerve showin' your face around here. Oh, I got nerve. Got it from you. We all did. What do you want? Today is your birthday, isn't it? Well, it's not gonna be a happy one with a coward around the house. Coward. Is that what you think I am? I think you're a gutless piece of shit. You betrayed your flag and your family. Thought you told us Old Glory stood for freedom of choice. And you chose to run. Do you remember tellin' us about the first time you saw Jackie Robinson play? About how the crowd was taunting him? How they were calling him a nigger? How they were threatening his life? How Pee Wee Reese, the Dodger shortstop, walked over and put his arm around Jackie? Silenced that hostile crowd? Two courageous Americans. One black and one white. You taught me about courage. You taught me about doing the right thing at the time. That's all I did. I learned it all from you. I hung on your every word. Hey, boy. You didn't come this far not to ask me what I want for my birthday. Let me help you, Pop. Let me help you. So what do you want for your birthday, Pop? A ride home. A ride home, Son. We can do that, Pop. Listen, old soldier, wherever you are The hills or the valleys come near or come far They say youth's a treasure We waste when we're young So come down from the place where your medals are hung You're forever returning and yearning to fight And you feel like an old soldier tonight Listen, old soldier 'Cause time doesn't wait The moon's on my shoulder The hour is late And something there inside still calls out to you Hey, you won't fade away Whatever you do You're forever beginning Barely winning the fight You feel like an old soldier tonight You're not getting any younger That much is true now But you still got that hunger This is it. All right. All right. Now, that's what we've been waitin' for. I've been waitin' for this for 40 goddamn years. To see you on this bike and see you smilin'. Back in the saddle. Never thought I'd see my father again, let alone see him smilin' and havin' a good time. I owe Shane for that gift. It should be one hell of a party. Only thing missin' is Mom and Wyatt. And Virgil should be here anytime now. Wes says he's bringing a surprise that's gonna blow everybody's mind. And if there's one thing in life I hate, it's fuckin' surprises. Listen, old soldier, to the sound in your ears Of too many battles And too many years There's only one thing that you've learned in defeat Losing is bitter and victory sweet You're always unraveling, traveling light You feel like an old soldier tonight Just like an old soldier tonight
