Yes, He answers all of your prayers in His own way. But remember, with God, all things are possible. Dial-a-Prayer, how may I pray for you today? Oh, such a discomfort. Can anyone help me? Mm-hm, praise God. Um, how may I pray for you today? This rash, can't you stop the itching? Ernest, it's time to wrap it up Let's see... you have a rash... rash. Um, where is the rash? Well, that's quite private. No, no, no, I just... I just need more information because.. the more specific that we are with our prayers... the more that the good Lord will be willing... to take your worry into consideration. All right, are you ready to pray with me? I hear that, I do. Hello? Just put your faith in the power of the Lord... and you gonna find those keys, girl. The Daily Devotional is offering a free trial... but after 30 days, you can continue with a donation arrangement. What was that? Oh, Sarah, oh, you are too much. All righty then, in faith. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up! Hold up! Those are valuable goods. It's your first day. It's a lot to take in, I know. Believe me, I have seen a lot of people crumble under the pressure to serve. But you look solid. Solid? Yeah. Coffee break! This lady called the other day, and, you know, kept crying and crying and... That guy called today, too, he started crying. I was just like, "You gotta keep the faith." You think there's any way I could go out and have a... Good morning, everyone! Good morning, Bill! Beautiful, beautiful day. Isn't it? Yes! Oh, Serena Belle, did you bring your iced lemon cake again? Mm-hm. We deserve our breaks. And how blessed we are to be sharing the good Lord's work... with the y, y callers who are reaching out to us. Another record week! Yay! Whoo! And! And! Repeat callers for Georgia... Marlene! For Serena Belle! Yes! That room, this building, these four walls... and the y walled cubicles... this space... this space is truly a special space. And the work you do, redeems you in the eyes of the Lord. This you must know and feel in your heart. You are all truly serving the master. We are, amen. God, not me. Dear Heavenly Father, bless this day. Let us serve you and your word in all its glory. Amen. Amen. All right, let's get to work, and by that, I mean, let's talk turkey. Pun intended. We are fast coming upon the great Thanksgiving holiday... and you know what that means. A whole lot of need. You mean, we're gonna be more busy than usual? Oh, honey, you haven't seen such need as the holiday, precious. Indeed, indeed, but now, now is the time to answer the call. We will not slow down. No. We will not leave a caller holding on the line. Mm-mm, no. We will push through, we will send out that prayer. We are special, and the work we do is special. And it matters. Hallelujah. Each and every one of you matters. Yes! Because we're here. Yes! Waiting with open arms. Yes! With open ears! Yes! And with open hearts, send it up! With open hearts, thank you, God! Thank you. - Amen. - Praise God. Oh, look, our new recruit. Welcome, Cora... welcome. And now, I have to ask you a very serious question. How's your serve? Reigning champs, LCSD Indoor Beach Volleyball League. Whoo! Huh? Welcome, playa! I don't really do sports. Oh! She doesn't really do sports. What do we say to that, team? If you can answer the call, you better pop that ball! Welcome, welcome to the fold. All right, it is time. Let's go do some good. Good work, everybody. Don't tell my wife, but I'm taking a piece of this cake. It's not gonna eat itself. No, it's not. Let's do some work, folks. Let's go. It's a sin to waste. My name is , and I'll help you through this, sir. The power of prayer is with you . Willingly afflict... we're created of children and men... I see my prayers... look with pity upon us. Anything is possible, Mrs. Lurie. It is possible with God. Are you hearing me? All right, listen with your whole heart. Close your eyes, and let my voice guide you. Yeah? You're not getting away that easy. I'm sorry. Tah-dah! I can't believe I almost... Well, here, hope it's not too small. Wow, it's got my name on the back and everything. Oh, yeah. We're on the same team now, you know? Right, um... well, Bill, I gotta jet. Godspeed. Well, that's... that's wonderful, Margaret. Yeah, yeah, that's... Margaret, that is fantastic. Absolutely. Oh, we are. We are good, too. She is, Cora is good. Yeah, okay, I will. Absolutely. See you on the fifth. Hello, sweetie. Margaret calling for the dirt. Is it after 4:00? I thought it was so much earlier. It's 5:00. Yeah. Margaret on the phone? Oh, yeah, right, well, she's just, um... You know, she's... bored. Wondering how we all are doing. Please tell me you told her that we're all doing A-okay. Yeah, of course. So? Fine. And you stayed the whole day? Yes. Did anybody give you a hard time? Jesus, Mom! Okay! Um, your father called... and he's really behind with the McCarron deposition. So he'd probably be a few more days in... But he's really looking forward to seeing you. Big, deep breath in... Dial-a-Prayer, how may I pray for you today? There it is. All right, good. All right, just listen intently. Go. I just don't have the energy to keep looking for a new wife. Well, anything is possible with God! Now personalize, personalize! ...Mr. Madison. There you go. And, if you're interested in signing up... Good, that's great, now go for it, now! ...then I'd be happy to sign you up for the morning meditation. It's an odd choice, but that's fine, just keep going. The morning meditation may indeed bring you to a closer place... with our Lord God in heaven. Remember, what is done for him in secret, shall be rewarded openly! Nice! Marlene, such an improvement from last week's debacle. Oh, thank you, , that means so much coming from you. Why do I always have to play the boring white ? Okay, Cora, are you ready to give it a shot? Jeff, I'd like to phone in. I've done a little dialogue work. Sure thing, yeah! Looks like we got time for one more. Here we go. Good, and... there. Um, Dial-a-Prayer Louder. Cora, how may I pray for you... A little too much. I'm lost. I can't find the strength to get along! And I think I'm gonna do it! Um... I will... today. Okay, um, well, Miss... Jeremies. Don't help her. Miss Jeremies, maybe I could offer you a prayer for protection. Oh... No, rather a prayer... something from the New Testament. I'm falling down into the pit of hell! My life has no meaning! Can't you just... Hang on, code word "can't", grab on to can't. Can't... um, well, Miss Jeffries, uh... "can't" is not a word that exists in the kingdom of heaven Um, it just doesn't, so... uh... um, I, uh... Sorry. That's fine. Okay, everybody, let's just take a breather, all right? We have to get back on active call duty anyways. So, uh, Cora, you take the lunch run. The lunch run... Please. We will try again another session later in the week. Does that sound good? MARY They are gonna love you there... once they figure out how gifted you are. I imagine you'll be promoted or something. I mean, opportunities come in the least expected places, they say. Mom... Listen, it's just us for dinner tonight... your father is switching planes in Cleveland or something. Oh, oh, my other let me call you back. Oh... shit. Cora? Is that you? Hey. Sorry if I woke you up. I have the early-riser shift. Did you just get here? They said you needed close monitoring. Mom! I'm 26 years old, I'm fine. And I should... I should be going, because I don't want to get a demerit slip or anything. You can't afford to make a single mistake, Cora. I want you to remember something. Every day is a beautiful beginning. Thy word is a lamb unto my feet and a light unto my path. Have a good day. All sorts of things are possible with God... my name is . I'm gonna pray with you. Create in me a pure heart, O God... in my newest steadfast spirit with me. Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me. And yes, always remember, in everything, God works good for those who love Him. The beauty of your creation, in earth and sky... God grant me the serenity to accept the things I can, and the wisdom... For hearts to love, for hands to serve. Breathe in faith. Breathe out fear. Where there is hatred, let us sow love. For all valiant seekers, after truth, liberty... Are you there? Speak up. Now say it with me. ...make us instruments of thy people. I remembered you. Be not frightened... neither be dismayed, for the Lord, your God is with you. Wherever you go... Wherever you go... Wherever you go... Whoa, whoa, whoa, Cora! I gotta get out of here! I'm sorry, we do not make our own break schedules here. I... I am through! Not to mention that business with the lunch run was rather nasty... I'm through& done! Serena had to make a run to Mick D's, of all places. I can't... this is bullshit. I am not cut out for this bullshit. I don't deserve to be in there with those freaks! All right, that's enough. Do I really have to remind you why you're in there? No. Now I understand you may be adjusting... but this could go very quickly go from a nice setup to one that is not so great. Isn't that true? The charges against you were steep. We petitioned the court, so you wouldn't have to do jail time. Jail time. I want you to think about that, would you? And I am still meant to answer to that judge, you know? Now we are graciously, so very graciously... allowing you to repent for your sin against us, and Him, and the church. Are we clear? Yes, sir. All right, you go home, get your head together. I'm gonna have to dock you for today's hours and yesterday's, too, for that matter. And don't think you can just go through the motions and get by. It might do you some good to actually partake. Understood? Yes. Yes, Mrs. Koehler, I think that's a great idea... to commit to a daily devotional while you work through this time with your husband. MRS. KOHLER He told me he wouldn't do it again if I gave him a third chance. Really? Well, then, I think you should tell your husband to go to hell Seriously... Mrs. Koehler? WO Is there anyway the check can come in this week instead of next? Well, rest assured we will handle your prayer request with care. We are here to offer you strength and hope... but you should probably give up on that check, ma'am. I just keep having these thoughts... these bad thoughts about other people. Well, I'm told when you feel the world growing small... and yourself great, read the 19th Psalm. Yeah, does that even make sense ? The prayer for recovery... could you do that one, please? It really made a difference. Yes, hold, please. Got it, a prayer for help. WO It has to be early admission otherwise the whole plan... Wait, wait, that's your SA score... and you're worried? Um, I'll put in the prayer request, Carrie, but I think you're gonna be fine. Keep the faith. Mm-hm. Hey, hey. Hey, busy day. Prayer for strength? Yeah... what? Prayer for strength, I heard you... I heard you with a caller... That daughter's marriage on the rocks, something like that. Uh-huh. And you so clearly stated that she needed prayer for strength. And you offered it... Right. But you didn't circle it, you see right here on the prayer order form? You circled the 37th Psalm, Cora, that's like a totally different area. Did you realize that you did that? That's the opposite just about. Jeffrey, everyone has a mix up now and then. Cora's been with us just under a month. No, no. 37th, I'm so sorry. I must not have had enough coffee. Thanks, Jeff. Jesus. Finding your groove? This is about as ungroovy as you can get. I don't know, I guess... Answering the phone is half of it. I mean, don't quote me, but most of these people just want to be listened to. If only it were that simple. Well, I don't know, maybe it is. And don't worry about Jeff. If he doesn't have one issue a day to get overly anxious about, it's not a day. It's a bit of an understatement I'd say. Um, do you think I could go out the side and go for a quick cig It's Thursday, Bill's at judo. Go for it. Thanks. Be back in ten. Hi, excuse me. Hi. Uh, I don't know if I'm in the right place. Are you looking for Bill? Do you start today or something? Uh, no. You, uh... What? Do you answer the phone in there? Uh, yeah, I'm on a break. I'm gonna go. Sorry, sorry, I... I've been driving all day. Well, there's an IHOP like three feet that way. I'm looking for someone who answers the phone in there. Her name's Cora. She's got the same voice. I think you must be confused. I don't think so. I mean, it's you, right? You're the one I spoke to. My name is Chase. I called you a couple of days ago. You answered, you said a prayer, it went away. Uh, do you remember? No, no, this isn't happening. I mean, it was you, right? I'm gonna go back... You said... you said a prayer for strength. It was you. You answered. You saved me. Yes! Free point! I'm just not sure she's ready. Was Jesus ready when he parted the Red Sea? Wasn't that Moses? Jeff, you're missing the point. The question is how are you feeling? Do you feel the need to guide? Oh, she's been here a month and she's clearly still struggling. Well, exactly, time's a wasting . I don't know, I just think maybe we should just give her some more time in the light. Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Jeff, look at me. Go for it, dude, be her shepherd. It's like Zeta-Jones and Douglas. If he hadn't gone for her Billy Bob-style... he wouldn't be married to that New Zealand hottie. Oh! Isn't she Welsh? Georgia! Aren't they divorced? I'm telling you, that Serena, she may be tiny, but she is mighty. Well, set her up, set her up. Pop the ball! Pop it! Listen to me, quit stalling and go for it. If anyone can save that soul, it's you. Now, go! What's up, playa? You good, you good? Okay. Not a lot of air in here, huh? No, none. You're looking good out there, it's so good! If I knew jerseys were optional I would have wore my bikini, too. Not really. I'm sorry about earlier. I respect your right to serve however you wish. Okay, come on, girl. Okay, um, thank you. Serve... I wasn't even planning that. Good one. Yeah. So, I know you got a lot going on in there... that I don't really know about... but the thing is... I just think maybe I can help you find your way back. My way back? Yeah. Is that what this is all about? Only a softened heart can accept God's forgiveness. A softened heart... Look, I... I don't need your help. I don't need your help, or Bill's help... or any of you... people. Okay? I'm fine. Totally fine. All right, Cora, you're up! Shit. There you are! So you guys want to get out of here? Yeah. Yeah. I know a little after hours party we can get in. Oh, yeah? You want to join, too, pretty? Huh? Come on. Yeah, let's do this. Oh, yay! Let's go! Oh, fuck. Cora! Do it! Yeah! Thank you for calling Dial-a-Prayer... the direct line of communication between you and our Lord God in Heaven. We are honored to serve him and pray for you. You have reached us during off-hours. Please call us again between 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM. Or if you like, press 1 and wait for the beep. Thank God, Cora, I have been so worried. I just need to change my clothes, Mom. Can you imagine for one second what must have been going through my head? Leave me alone! Cora! And I certainly couldn't call the police, could I? Your father pulled a lot of strings to get you out of that nightmare! What you did! That horrible group! The trial! Do not make a mess of this! You made a mess out of this! Me? We did everything that we possibly could to help you! We... Mom? He's not here! He's not here! And he's not gonna be back for Thanksgiving. He'll probably give some lame excuse and then he's gonna leave us! Again! No, he is on a trial, he is on a deadline! But if he were here... if he were here... But, Mom, when are you gonna wake the fuck up? Now, I'm sorry, if you'll excuse me, I have to go enlighten people. Everyone deserves a second chance, right, Mom? Even sacrilegious scum like me? Look, she's moving. Oh, my god! Praise Jesus. Oh, wow. That was amazing. I'm so sorry. It's okay. I'm okay. It's all okay. Are you all right? You want me to call someone? No. Why don't you stay here a minute? I'm gonna be late for work. I can do this. I can do this. You sure you're gonna be all right? Yeah... thank you. Cora! Early riser, as in early and awake, you get me? We've had calls lined up since we opened. Your faith... that's what's important. Hold on to your faith and just... Push through, through the power of prayer. Yes! New verbiage we're looking to incorporate. Alliteration... we went over this in the morning meeting. You'll find instructions at the front of the binders. A wo called in this AM, asking for you specifically. Said you'd made a real difference for her. What'd she say? That, "you were sent from above." Really? I thought you should know. Serena Belle! Enough with the music, you've got three lines blinking Good afternoon, Dial-a-Prayer, this is Serena Belle... how may I pray for you today? Dial-a-Prayer, this is Cora. Hi. Do you remember me? Parking lot? What do you want? I'm hoping we can start over. Beyond a prayer, technically I am not supposed to... Look, I came here to meet you, because you made a difference. And I'd just really like to thank you properly. This isn't happening. Let me buy you a cup of coffee, at least. I don't know. I... There's a burger spot across from my hotel on 275. No, I... no, I don't know. It looks halfway decent. I shouldn't. I promise, one cup of coffee, that's it. Can you meet me there, please? Okay! Okay. Let's always try to wrap it up with... "Have a blessed day." Thank you. Sure. Thanks for coming. Yeah, I can't stay long. Coffee? Yeah, coffee's good. You having an okay day? It's fine. So do people like living here? If you like gray days and never-ending winter. You do? Winter can be nice sometimes when it first snows.. but after that... You're still here, though. Something like that. Salad bar is getting new coolant, so it's just a la carte today. I'll be back in a minute to take your order. Thanks. So this must be really anti-climactic for you. I wouldn't say that. You don't have to be nice. Sorry, I don't really go in for the prayers so much. You sort of seem like that, too . I don't really know what you were expecting. I... Look... I get it, that something really great happened to you... and that's good, you should hold on to that. Okay. But I... I'm not gonna make you better. I'm not gonna keep you better or whatever it is that you think. Maybe not. For sure, not. Look, I'm not what you're looking for. And you can think whatever it is, but that's gonna have to stay in your own head. I'm not what you need. You think you know what I need? I gotta go. Look, um, can you... do you wanna just take my number? I just... I drove a long way to get here. I don't know anybody in town. I don't know, maybe you'll feel like we could see each other again? I won't. I'm really sorry. Bless us, O Lord, for these thy gifts... which we are about to receive in Your holy name. God of all blessings, source of all life, giver of all grace We thank you for the gift of life, with the food of this earth... for the mystery of creation, and for the graces and blessings. Your mercy is everlasting and gracious. It is always a blessing when we can share this time together with family, friends... and our dearest loved ones. Amen. You shouldn't be here. Had to come. I was worried you'd get real time. Jesse's still at Moun... I... I don't want to talk about it. At least your father pulled through. Everybody else left to hang. I don't know what's worse. What is this about? Are you okay? I wanted to see you. See how you were. Cora, there's no way you could have known she was inside the church. It's so stupid. You're so stupid. The hell with those people and their sacred space! Only the darkest acts... will keep us from the pole of our own negativity. Please. You were better with us. Standing up to the bullshit... was a good thing. Lighting a match was the biggest... Stop! Everybody back there cares for you, Cora. And you gotta know that we're the ones who really got your back. I don't know. Um, the wo... does she have jet black hair, like porcelain skin, regal almost, beautiful. I can't remember. She could have been gone, Shane... forever. And the church is making me do some bullshit community service... because of my asshole, connected father... Cora. And you know what? No, I feel bad, really bad. And the shittiest part is... is that lately people are starting to treat me like I'm good. It's okay. It's not okay! It's not! I mean, how could I be? Living back here. We're all waiting for you, Cora . This is no place for you. Can expect up to an inch of snow and a high of only 30. Overnight, flurries will increase with total accumulations of three inches. Tonight's low, near 15. Scattered snow squall activity tomorrow with a high of 34. With the wind out of the north at 19 miles per hour. It's currently 20... Hello, Dial-a-Prayer. Hi, it's me. You can't call me here anymore... okay? Cora, please don't hang up. I need to know right now if what you're telling me is bullshit.. about me saving you. I'm sure it is, I just, I just- - If you are telling me the truth, then I need... I just need to know. Okay? You gotta believe me... can't you? Please believe me. I'll be there after work. Before when I called, I was in a dark place... and I... I don't like to talk about it... but... I mean, I will if you need me to. I do. I don't know. It's like... a voice in my head telling me I'm no good. You know? Sometimes when it gets really loud, I would just... I would do anything to get away from it. Make it stop. Prayer seemed to settle everything down for me... but more than that... it was you. I felt it when I met you. And when I saw you at the diner it was there again... and I can't explain it. But, I don't know... it was like a calm came over me . But... if you don't want me to come around anymore, I won't. Okay? I should probably go, because... I don't know... I'm not... Please don't go. You sure? Yeah, I... I'd like it if you stayed. Okay. I'd like that. Bam! That's what I'm talking about! Praise God! Dial-a-Prayer, this is Cora. Thanks for holding. Hallelujah! Okay, I'll circle that. Corresponding average... Praise God! Praise God! You've just dialed a prayer. So where are we headed? Hopefully not as far as last time. North... keep going. So this is the draw, huh? I know, I mean, it's not... it's not much, but... this flat, white surface... doesn't mean anything to you? Yeah, the new-ness. Nothing's happened to it. It's so white. Yeah, it's very white. I don't know, doesn't that kind of make it boring, though? I mean, like how long can it stay like this before it melts... or a deer shits on it, or a truck drives through it? You know, then what? Then it's no good? I mean, you can't stay perfect forever. I know. But did you remember to make a list of all the good things that came out of getting fired? No, I... I get that. I don't know, maybe think about the walk that you can take in the morning. Cora, it is amazing. Um, hold, please. We've had calls backed up for you for the past hour. You are on to something. Is it the uals? Do you find them helpful? Or is it... Cora! Girl, you are a rock star! I mean, genius, so, so genius! My teachings are helping, no? Our numbers are double the drive-through center in Barst. Seriously, they are like eating our dust! And just think of the lives that you've touched or we've touched Cora, you must feel so light. Cora, you're an inspiration! Cora, you have like six lines waiting. Get the phone, honey. Guys, we may have to work overtime today. Overtime. Yea-yah! Um, thank you for holding. When I was a kid, I used to do these crazy Google searches... looking for towns with weird names, like Taco. Named Nothing or Somewhere. But any city I'd ever go to, I'd always like to find a place like this. I would look at all the lights, and I would imagine a person for every one of those lights. It's amazing. Kind of all looks pretty from over here. Hm. When things got bad for me last couple of years... I remember they said it was chemical or some shit, but... I couldn't stop thinking... "My lights going out... "And no one is even noticing." I thought I could fix it... if I... if I found a town called Somewhere. You know, that if I... if I went there... and I left everything and everyone, it had to be a place that mattered. You know, a place where I wouldn't get lost. Or if I did get lost, it would be okay. I don't know. You seem like someone who pays attention when the lights go out. Real attention. Hm. You ever wish you could start over? I do. Completely from scratch. See you later. Hey-ho! Good morning. Morning, there, Jeff. Good morning! Hey... Cora. Hey, it's got a reindeer! See you later. Oh, I remember that. It was the Chancel Drama, you were the Angel Gabriel. What? Look, the wings are practically twice your size. That was beautiful. Tell me. Well, the Angel Gabriel went to visit Mary in Nazareth... and told her that she would give birth to the son of God. Which was not possible, because Mary was a virgin... but Gabriel said that nothing was impossible with God. And then you stood up at age four and you proclaimed... in the clearest of voices, "Nothing is impossible with God." You were a little angel. Hm. Yeah, I guess I was. Hey. Hey. I got a call... you'll never guess from where. Who? Not who, where? Somewhere. No way. She said she was from Somewhere... and I asked her to clarify and- Wow. I'm serious. Well, there you go. Pretty odd chances, right? Are you okay? Yeah, no, Somewhere, it's crazy. You think the prayers really make a difference? Seems that's what people believe anyway. Maybe believing it's working is enough, you know? Yeah. Or maybe it's just being there for someone is all. Like I was there for you... right? Yeah. You think you'll stay in town for a while? Yeah, I think so, for now. Looking around for some work. Thank you, Cora! Cora! Cora! Pray for me, Cora! Oh, praise Jesus! Hallelujah! It's all a myth! Based on nothing! These empty phrases. You people think you're helping. Do it! Do it! This machine that asks you to pray to what? Come on, Cora! The same old stories? Do it! Do it! Come on! Do it! Do it! Yeah! Yeah! Come on! What does the church represent? What they say? What they've done? Religion is the thing that destroys countries. Look at all the wars in the last century. How y are connected to this idea of how to worship? Go. Let's go. Cora! Cora! Cora! And you, you people there with your amen's... and your praise this. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Did you happen to look at page nine where that younger demographic is highlighted? They just love to watch these things on the web. No, no! Ho, I get limited resources, but listen, ... sometimes you have... No... okay... thank you, Reverend. Sorry to interrupt. Cora... come in. Sorry for the mess. Are you okay? Yeah, fine, what's up? I just lost track of my hours, so I was wondering... how much longer? Oh, well... things are certainly proving to work out well, right? Yeah. I... um... All right, Cora, let's say your hours are met. Yeah? But do you really think you're done? I just... yes. How does it feel? I don't know, I'm just doing what you told me to do, and... No, no, believing. How does it feel to believe? Yeah, sure, you're following instructions, you're getting here on-time. But think about it, what's changed? You believe. You see? You just needed something to believe in. I don't really think it's that. Oh, Cora, stick with this. See it through. I think you're on to something... something real, something bigger... Something bigger than even we can know. Okay. Okay, um, thank you for your time. Something. Something real. Tell me again. Hide not thy face from me in the day... when I am in trouble. Something, something... when I call... answer me speedily. That's beautiful. Yeah, I think so. It's the one I really like. Makes sense. I don't know. You're a good person, Cora. Remember that. Okay. Will I see you later? Yeah. You know, I think he's gotta be married. What? Married! I mean, I hate to say it, but I've seen this too y times before. Let me break it down for you. He shows up out of nowhere, right? Out of the blue? This beautiful stranger ... You gotta admit, he doesn't sound like the type that's gonna frequent a phone line to God. Well, you don't know. Okay, maybe, yeah, maybe it's all on the up and up. Yeah, maybe. We're just talking. Yeah, now you're just talking. Uh, oh. I get it. And you? You got your story? My story? What you did, where you come from? Look, if he's really serious about all this... a believer... I get where you're going with this. You don't think he deserves to know sooner rather than later? Oh, Jesus. Look, Cora, I'm just... I'm just trying to keep you from getting hurt. I get it, okay? Oh, my god! Um, O Father of mercies and God of all comfort. Our only one we need in time of need. O Father of mercies and God of all comfort. Our only hope in time of need. We believe your sage that we behold... visit and relieve our sick servant until our prayers are desired. Look upon him with mercy and comfort and restore him to health. To... t... To take away the residue of his life and lead him to thy glory, to thy faith... Cora, Cora, honey, it's okay. It's okay, you can stop now. He was just walking across the floor. Waiting on Dad? He told me he would be here through the holidays. Right. And I believed him. I am gonna be out. I'm not coming home tonight. What was it you believed when you were down there with those people? What? Why would you do such a thing... I... I really don't want to talk about this. Do you know we are still the subject of every dinner party? We have one of those kids. But you are not a kid any more, are you? You could be starting out and... what happened to you? How did you go from my beautiful, sweet, little angel girl to that? Leaving me here trying to figure out how you could just destroy something... that is so sacred to us, to the whole city, the church! The church! That poor wo! I'm leaving now. This is not just going to go away, Cora. Cora... No, I do not know his last name but come on, dude, he's been staying here for a while. Can't do it. We were supposed to meet. Policies. I've left him like five messages. Shit. Are you married? What? Are you married? I'm not an idiot, I have female intuition, and... and... Okay, no, no, I'm not. How long have you been sitting out here? Where were you? I'm sorry. I waited for you. I waited for you. I know, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, it's freezing out here. Come inside, let's get you warm Yes, Marilyn, yes, it was delivered. Circled, yes, prayer for health. Well, we didn't... Well, I am indeed very sorry to hear that... but let us pray together now for strength... to move up and through this challenging time... Marilyn? Marilyn? Marilyn? What are you looking at? Where's ? I thought you knew. Leave of absence. Hey, what's the rush? That picture in your room... who is that? Look, let's go someplace... No, no! Tell me. It's the wo from the church, isn't it? You know her. Look, I can explain, okay? She's okay, she's doing better... but it was bad, it was bad for a long time. I had to put her in a home. I lost my job. Look, I didn't know anything. All I knew was that some girl, some name did this to my mother and got away. And I couldn't make sense of it so I wanted to come here... and I wanted to find you and do something, and I didn't know what... so I just drove here and then... and then it changed the second I met you. You... It changed the second I met you You drove here and then... Everything that happened between us is real. This is not... You've changed me. I am so stupid. I am so stupid. Believing that you... You actually wanted me. Believing that I was making a difference. Cora. I don't care! I'm just doing it to get out of it. That is not true. Okay? You're making a difference for me. You gotta believe that. I don't believe you. I don't believe in any of this. This is all bullshit! You're bullshit! Cora, come on. Not the greatest look, I know. You look beautiful. Jeff has a girlfriend they tell me. Yes. Oh. Yes, he, uh... he even started taking off Thursdays. Oh, good for him! And Bill created a new division... prayers for the economy. What? There are no flies on Bill. That's for sure. And you? How are you doing, Cora? I'm okay. Bullshit. Correct. Everybody has a past, Cora. You can't let what's come before stop you from seeing what's right in front of you. You think I'm not pissed? You think I haven't had my fair share of angry, "screw you" moments? Who am I gonna blame? Huh? I just have to believe that there is a plan for me. For us. And I have to ride it out gracefully. It's funny, but you know, I really miss that place. Made me feel good about it all. I think everybody wants to believe something. God, the universe, whatever it is. Makes them feel better. Believing there is good in people. Something good in all of us. Dial-a-Prayer, this is Cora. Yes, hi, Sandy, nice to talk to you again. Yes, how is, uh... how's your dog? Still sick? Oh, whoa, whoa. Okay, well, start from the beginning. Mm. Well, you're stronger than that . Completely and you don't deserve that, and you should leave. This is Cora. Dial-a-Prayer? Hello? Is it you? Are you there? Just press it. Yup. They tell me you've met your hours and then some. Thinking you'll stay on? I don't know. Your mother's enjoyed having you here. I know. Well, then, seems like you're on a better path. Cora. We miss you when you don't come back, you know? She does. She deserves better from you. You never asked me why I did it. You just said that you would take care of it. But do you ever wonder why I ended up down there? I did it, because I wanted to feel something... all the way through me. And I wanted to be seen... really seen. Hey, Bill, can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Walk with me. Do you think it mattered? What do you mean? Me, being here, answering those phones those weeks. Did it matter? I think it did, I know it did. I don't know, I wish I could take it all back. I know. I guess I kind of liked all this. Believing that I could help, make something happen. You have, Cora. You know that. Maybe. But I don't know if any of that matters. The charts and the goals and the praying from binders. Are what, to make us feel better about our own lives? I think... I think says it best. Miracles happen every day. Every day, everywhere, and never, right? Well, that's... that's one way of putting it. And I think you were right. I think... I know I'm done. And I finally know what I'm supposed to do next. Hey, folks, there's still three hours left in this day... according to my watch. There's time! Time to help! We can still make a difference, we can. Blessed are they who show mercy for mercy shall be theirs. Merc... Thank you for calling Dial-a-Prayer, this is Bill. How may I pray for you today? Dial-a-Prayer, this is Jeff. This is Serena Belle. Marlene Hammond. Going out? You know what? I'm picking up the turkey tomorrow... and maybe even getting a bunch of st... That's great, Mom. I'm sorry... about... about all of it. About everything I put you through. And I need you to know that I'm gonna be okay. I need you to know that. That rage was not you. It was me. It is me. But you don't need to worry about it. You just need to let it be. I should never have left you to cry. What? When you were a tiny baby, it took forever to put you to sleep... and it was exhausting. So I got one of those books, because that's what everybody else was doing... And then, one night I just left you there calling out for I don't know... I don't even know how long it was, maybe an hour. Mom... No, wait, let me finish. I did that because I thought it was the right thing to do... but my gut was telling me that it was wrong. And so y times since then, I... I have not been able to even feel my own gut. And I'm sorry, I'm sorry it started there with you. You know what, sometimes when we are lost... we listen to all the wrong instructions. I'm gonna be all right. I really think I'm gonna be okay. I know. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Cora. CORA Hi, it's me. This is like the closest I can come to praying. So... so here it goes. CORA A prayer for me. I believe in you. I believe in the good in you. And I believe in what you did for me. Showing me that I could make a difference. And giving me a chance. A second chance. CORA And if you do believe in me, like you said you did. I'm, um... I'm going somewhere. I found it, and... I don't know, maybe you'll meet me... and maybe we could just start again... completely from scratch.
