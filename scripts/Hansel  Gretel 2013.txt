What is this meat? - The juiciest kind! - Lillith, thanks again! I don't know what we would've done without you! - Probably bleed to death, I guarantee you! - You know, I think you should eat something a little more substantial! How about a pastry? - I'm fine, really, I'm not at all hungry! - You've got to try something! This stuff is amazing! - Lillith, is this you over here in this picture? - Oh, dear! Yes! Very, very long time ago! - These are my boys! They're twins! - Like you and Hansel! - Who's the baby? - Oh, that's my little Abigail! My little bird! - She did not make it! - Oh, I'm sorry! - She was just ... born weak! The world was too much for her small body! - Oh, Lord! - Oh, bless his heart! He's just exhausted! - Oh, it's a food coma! - Hansel? - Honey, come on! We're going to lie down! - Sorry, sweetheart! - Oh, it was delicious! - I can't believe it! - Watch, watch, we gonna walk, you know! - You guys are welcomed to spend the night! My house is your house! - We really should go, Lillith! It's been wonderful! I wouldn't want to bother any more! - Nonsense! Didn't I just say that what's mine is yours? - You can take my room! Besides, the forest is very dangerous at night, as Hansel has already discovered! We'll take him to the hospital in the morning! - Okay, if you insist! But what about you, Lillith? Where you gonna sleep? - Sweetheart, I don't sleep much these days! Never know if I'm waking up! - How about some tea? - That'd be nice! - Who's that? - That's my brother, Nathan! - Do you have a brother? Might be things that I never knew! - I do not talk about him much! Let's just say we didn't get along! - Can I ask where he is now? - He died! - Long, long time ago! - I'm sorry to hear that! - Here we go, dear! - Here you are! - You two look so much like your mother! - That's what Dad tells us! - You must miss her very much! - I don't really remember her like I should! - But I guess I miss the idea of her! - It is hard on Hansel, though! He 'as a weight on his shoulders ever since! Why is that to you? - She was getting him medicines! - He blames himself! - I see! - Well, We all have our burdens! And we 're all dealing with them very differently! - How do you like it? It's my special blend! - It's nice! It's very sweet! - Are you all right? - Yeah, but I just feel a little dizzy! - You have a very hard time, Gretel! - You'll get a good sleep till morning! - Oh, good morning! How are you feeling? - Where's Hansel? - We had a neighbour taking him to hospital this morning! - I tried to wake you, but you were so exhausted! - I have to go! I have to be with him! He can't take care of himself! - Well, as soon as the neighbor's back, dear, we'll have him take you in! - I have a terrible headache! - I have something for that! - Here you go! - Here, suck on one of those! - Good for headache and stomach pain! - You know, dear, probably you'd feel better if you took a shower! - Yeah, maybe! - I don't have anything to change into! - Oh, I have plenty of things that'll fit you, dear! - Oh, God! My stomach! - It's okay, you don't need to be afraid! - He surely should be! - Kevin, please, quiet! - Hi, I'm Jane! What's your name? - I'm Hansel! Where the hell are we? - We don't know where we are! They got you in here last night! - You were probably drugged! Do you feel a funny taste in your mouth? - Yeah, actually there is! - The medicine does that to you! - There used to be more of us! Now you make four! - Four! What's that? - You're one of us now! - I'm one of what? - Food! - What's ... What's going on? What's happening? - Let me out! - What's happening? - You'd also eat something before it's all gone! - What? How can you eat that shit? - We don't want to, but ... - It makes you eat even more! - Can you just please stop, and tell me what the fuck is going on? - We're meat! - We don't know that, Kevin! - Yes, we do! That at least they make so! - You have no proof! - Jane just doesn't want to admit the truth that we're cattle, that they fatten us here, then take us through that door! - And you know what's after that? It's screaming! - Terrible harm screaming! - They won't even wait till we're fattened up anymore! - Meat! That's what we are! - But that's not gonna stop me from enjoying it right now! - Hey! No! - Leave her alone! - Help! - Gretel, dear, could you come here? I want to show you something! - Lillith, I really should get going! I mean I ... - Do you know what this is? - It's the deed! To the bakery! Do you know why I'm showing it to you? - Does this mean what I think it does? - Yeah, it's yours! - I'm leaving you the gingerbread house for you to carry on! - After I'm gone! - But what about your kids? - I mean why didn't they ... - I wouldn't trust them for a penny! - But you ... the moment I met you, I knew it was to be yours! - Lillith, I don't know what ... - All you have to do is just sign it, dear! - That's all you have to do! And then it's official! - Okay! - The thing is I don't want to spend the rest of my life in Candlewood! - Well, I understand, dear! I do! - But signing this just means that it's legally yours! - And if you don't want to take the responsibility, then I trust you'll find someone who does! - I can't do it, Lilith! I mean this is your baby! - It's yours! - I don't want anybody else to have it! Just you! Please! - Okay! - Lillith, I'm sorry! - It's fine! Don't worry! - Oh, dear! Let me get you a bandage! -Gretel! - You're wasting your time! - We've all tried! - Hey! What are you doing to her? Hey! - Thank you for sweeping, dear! You really didn't have to! - It's the least I can do! - Is everything all right, dear? - Fine! - I have some treats for us in a jiffy! And then we'll have some girl talk, okay? - Okay! Great! - Why are you doing this? - So I'd just stay here and stuff my face with that poison and wait until I get fucking eaten?! - What, you got a better idea? - Yeah, not get eaten! That plan! - I need to find her and make sure she's okay! - Was she with you when you got drugged? - Was she a big girl? - They may have already eaten her! They love big girls! They really like'em! - Shut the fuck up, Kevin! - I bet she's coming back! She wouldn't let me here to die! - I'll be back in a jiffy! I'm going get some frosting! - Gretel? - Oh, my God! Hansel? - Hansel? - That's her! - Gretel! - Well, that's unfortunate! - Gretel, help! - I'm down here! Please, help! - Lillith, what's going on? - W h a t ' s g o i n g o n ? - Well, you're going to wear these now! That in order to be civil to each other! - Leave her alone! What? Wait a minute! - Why is Hansel in your cellar? - Put the shackles on! - No! Answer me! What's going on? What are you doing to him? - To him? Nothing yet! - I'm here! Behind you! - Turn around! Around! And you know when we stop? - Only Lillith knows! - Hush! Hush! Hush! - You know what? - I had hoped this would be a pleasant experience! - Well! - I'm down here! - I'm sorry! - No! I know she can still hear me! - Gretel, help! I'm down here! Help! - Okay, can you please just let me know if you see them again? - Great! Thanks, Sassie! - What's the trouble, Ruby? - You haven't seen them since last night!? - Kids get disappearing, right? Maybe something happened to them, too! - This wouldn't be that big a deal! The fact is Gretel is so responsible! - That's right! She would let her father know where they are! - Especially if anything happened! - We'll keep our eyes on, okay? Look, they're good kids! I'll personally keep an eye on! - We'll find them! Easy as pie! - I wanna teach you things! To show you things! - I need you to trust me so I can trust you! - Please, please, let us go! - Shut up! - I've heard it all before! - Gretel, these are my boys! John and Bobby! - Just like the Kennedys! - They are my family! - I would like you to be a part of our family! Would you like that, sweetheart?? - No! - Well, I'll give you some time to reconsider that! - But right now, it's lunch time! Right, boys? - Gretel, please come help me for lunch! - Please, Gretel! - Listen to me! You are not cattle like the rest of them! - Don't make me treat you like that! - Please come help set the table now! Please! - How's your leg going? - It's getting worse! - But with those pills that old bitch gave me I'll be able to make my way off! - I'm really sorry! - I wish I could have something to give you! - Yeah! Me, too! - Well, how's that I haven't seen you around before!? - I'm not from around here! I'm from Ohio! - I was making my way out to New York! You know? Big plans, big city! - You sound just like my sister! - She also wants to get out of here, and leave all here behind, too! - So why the big city? Why New York? - When I was three I started playing the piano! - I always wanted to be a concert pianist in NewYork! - My father's always saying: "Oh, you'll fail, Jenny! You'll fail!" - Hey! Your dad's an asshole! We'll get to get out of here, okay? - I think I could get this lock open if I've something sharp enough! - Please, tell me you're a locksmith! - No! But I watch a lot of TV! And sometimes it comes in handy! - Hey! What about this? - Yeah! Perfect! - Almost! - No! No! - I'm sorry it didn't work! - I wish I had something sharper! - You know, I'm not so afraid anymore! - I use to tell myself that at least, and it seems to help! - Look! We're getting to get out of here, okay? - Listen to me! I promise we're getting to get out of here! - I mean, how can you be so sure? - Because I'm not gonna die down here! - Not now, not in ... Look, just trust me! I've got big plans and I wanna take you with me! - Okay? No ass-hole father, no psycho bitch is gonna take you from me! - Just trust me! - OK! Dig in! - Hey! Use your fork! - Dig in! - I'm not hungry! - Well now that is going to change! From now on you eat what I tell you to eat! - And when I tell you to eat it! Then we all can get along! - Now eat! - I'm not hungry! - You know? Nathan didn't listen to me, either! - And now his little boys still don't have a daddy! - Oh! Surprised, little bird! - I made it look like you really didn't want to live, didn't I? - Look, your brothers love it! Dig in! - They're not my brothers! - Oh, they are now! Eat! - No! - Eat! - I won't! - Fucking eat! - Go to hell! - Go after her! Bring her back here! You, too! - Well done, babies! Well done! - And now if you wanna act like an animal, you can eat like one! - Eat this! It has power! - Get away from me! - Open your mouth! Yeah! Oh! Gooooood! - You'll be stronger than you've ever been! Yeah, chew it! - You're just eating Dana! She was young and plump! - How does she taste? - How could I be so wrong about you? - I thought you were special! I thought you were like me! - Take her downstairs with the others! She is too weak to be your sister! - Hi, baby! What's you're doing? - Just looking for a clue to where they might've gone! - Do you know where this is? - I know that's in the woods somewhere! Mom used to take them over there! - They called it the hand tree! - It was their special place, where they'd go! No daddies were allowed! - Well, that's a good place to start! - Yeah, I think you're right! - What is it? - Are you okay? Did they hurt you? - Why are you doing this to us? - No, no! No, please! No! Thank you! - No, no! Stop it! - Why would she do that? - Why was she trying to piss them off? - To save us! - I think they're gone! - Ain't kidding me! - No! Let me go! - Oh! Help me! No! Let me! - This is the way! - No! He enters this way! - I've been listening to everything these people do! I know their every move! - And I know more about this house than they realize! - Yes! But they took Jane this way! - We've got to get to her first! - I really like Jane! - But if we go down there all of us four will die! - This way, if we've ever get to live! - No! Stop! No! - Oh, God! - I don't think it's possible! - But I'll send back help! - Good luck! - Maybe he's right! - No, we can't leave her behind! - We couldn't even be free, if it wasn't for her! - Right! - We have to get her! - Let's go! - What's up, brat? - The sheriff says you know these woods pretty good! - Yeah, pretty much, just like it's my home! - Do you know where this is? - Yeah, it stands by Fells Point! Do you want me to take you? - No! Just keep watching! We'll go! - Are you sure? - Yeah! - Okay! We'll turn up ... in the morning! - Thank you! - OK! Let us squeeze through! - How's your leg? - It's not too bad! I won't at all think about it! - Okay, that's cool! - Okay! - John! John! Get in there! I need you now! - I have to cover those tracks!! - You go get them, right? - Give them a message! And we'll have a real feast tonight! - Make Mama proud, baby! Go! - I just can't believe she kept all these locked in here for years! - Are these due to her own kids? - John? John! - Go! Go! Go!! - Are you sure this is it? - Jerry seemed certain! - OK! - No! - Oh, no! No! No! No! - Wait! Wait! Shhh! - She's there! Come on! - Wait! Wait! - That's a plan, okay? I don't think we should even do this! - We'll kill them! All of them! So they can never do this to anyone again! Come on! Let's go! - It's OK! It's OK! Look at me! - It's what you had to! It was him or us! OK? - Jane! Let's cut her loose! - Careful! - It is good! - Lillith? Hello? Lillith! Hello! - Deputy! - Jesus! - Sorry! - I've been looking for you all day! - Really? What for? - Hansel and Gretel are missing! - And I know you're close to Gretel! So do you have any idea where they might be? - I think this might show some light on it! - I found this slipped under the door when I came in. - This ... this isn't Gretel's handwriting! - Why are you closed today, Lillith? - You know, just needed a day off! - That's the great thing about your own business! - Did you ... cut yourself? - Good heavens, no! - I was making meat pies at home! And I've just come a little messy! - I want you to hang tight here! I'll call the sheriff! - You know, I'm really in a hurry! - Please! Guess he wanna speak with you! - Deputy Carter! Sheriff Mackiss?! - Deputy Carter! Sheriff Mackiss?! Copy?! - Ok! You know, I really wish you ain't bother in! - Hey, it's Jerry! - I'm at the Ginger Bread House with Lillith and ... - Gretel, this way! - She is weak, Hansel! We think it's all right if we stop to rest! - No! We have to keep moving! Come on! - Gretel! - I'm so tired! - Do you want to die? Do you want to die? Now, come on! - Help me! - She's following us! - What is that? - My eyes are burning! - I don't see anything! Where are you, guys? - I'm fucking delicious! - Hansel! Help me! - Gretel? - Where are you? - Gretel? - Gretel! I'm coming! Gretel? - Give up, Jane! - Daddy? - Daddy, where are you? - Not gonna make it, Jane! - Dad, please! - I just need your help! - Jane, better give up! - No, dad, I won't! I will ... - You're a failure! - I'm not! - Don't you see? - Dad! - You won't make it! - Dad, I won't fail, I promise! - How do I get out of here? - You cannot make it, accept it. - You won't make it! You're a failure! - No! - That is always so! - No, that is not so! - Give up! I am so disappointed! - No, you're not! - You no matter what I do! - I'm out! - You're trapped! - There's no escaping! - You belong to me! - Now! - Leave me alone! - No! No! Please! Leave me alone! - There's nowhere to go now! - Please! - I think I want you in my home! - I think ... I think it was ... I think it was one of her tricks! - Oh, my God! This is where she cooked them! - How many kids do you think there have been here? - Too many! - She's been making the meat pies for years! - I loved her meat pies! - Jane! No! - Jane? She's dead! - Come on! It's locked! - There's no keys! - Hansel, it's not good! - If there's a way in, I think there's a way out! - I see an opening! It looks like it's being big enough there to crawl through! It looks too small! Over here! - You're going the wrong way! - Come on! So we get out! - This is definitely the wrong way! - I was wondering if you ... Hey! This is Jerry! I'm at the Ginger Bread House with Lillith and ... - Oh, my God! Ruby! - Ruby, come here! - What the shit is this? - Hansel? - Gretel? - Hansel? - Jerry? - You here? - Jerry! - Hello? - Is anybody here? I've never seen this house before! Have you? - No! Me neither! I mean, it's crippy! - Anybody here? Hello? - Well, look at this place! - That's Lillith's car! I thought she lived in the city! Come on! - Maybe she knows where they are! - Ruby! That's her car! That's Lillith's car! My God! Ah! - They are here! We get to find them! And get them out of here! - In your dreams! - Where are my kids? - I don't have time for this! - You, too! - God! Oh! My God! - Help me! - My God! I'll get help! I'll get help! - It's okay! I'm gonna get help! - She's going to eat them! - What? who? - Other kids! - What kids? Where are they? Where? - All died! - What others? Where are they? Hold on! Hold on! Just hold on, OK? - In ... cabin ... old woman! - Kid?! Kid!? Jesus! - This is sheriff Mackiss! Anyone there? - Sheriff Mackiss! Is anybody there? - Central! What seems to be the problem, Sheriff? - Yeah, this is Woody Look! I need a paramedic! - I have a kid hit! - Wait! Wait! Do you hear that? I think he is after us! - Go! Go! Faster! - Go!

I probably be back before you arrive! - 10-44! Watch you that! - Over and out! - All available units on Bellfort ... - Just go, Gretel! Just go! - oh, my God! Ruby! - Just keep moving! Let's go! - Come on! Let's go in! - I do not know! - oh, my God! She's coming! - We got to get out of here! - I can't get out! - Let her go! - Get out! - Dad! - You got to be kidding me! A dead end? - Come on! Grab them! - How are we to get out of here now? - We've got to keep moving! - You won't get on walking with that leg! - We can map it, you know? - Make sure we get in the right direction, and not going in circles! - Come on! - Where did you learn that? - Fifth grade! Mrs. Graf! - An old Indian Trick! Native American! She never liked me! - Don't give me that look! - Wha ... a ... - It's the same look Mom had when she was proud of me! - I wasn't always a damn ass! - I didn't say that! - It's cool! I just wanted you to see it! - Yeah! We'll miss Ms Graf telling one more thing, too! Let's go! - Over here! - Go! - Go! Go! Go! - Is he dead? - Of course he's not dead! - Who was that guy anyway? - Family! - Her family! - Let's go! - Hold me, okay? Is it? - Yeah, I'd feel much better when in a hospital fed up with drugs! - Pain? Sure! - Let's keep going! Come on! - Oh, my God! - Listen! I got help coming! They will be here pretty soon! - Gretel! I can pull it out! One, two ... - Who are you? - There's no way to range you! - No! - You're not getting anywhere with this, Lillith! You've shot the sheriff! - People're likely to come! - Yeah, but I've killed the deputy, too! - So we better hurry! Get your brother! Hurry up! - It's time for supper! - What ... this ... - Why are you doing this, Lilith? - Why am I doing this? Because it didn't work! - Do you know how old I am? - Come on! Get up! Come on! Come on! - Get along, little doggies! Let's go! - Get in! - Get over here! Sit down! - You! Here, look at this! Look at the bottom of it! - See the date? Back then they called me a witch! - You can have this! You can have it all! You deserve to live forever, Gretel! And I can show you how! I can give this to you! - Hey! Hey! Look! Let's kill him together! - We'll take his heart and we'll eat it! It's not meat! It's youth! - We'll eat youth! Oh! You're going to love it! - Need it! Trust me! - No! - I see! - I wanted to save you! I wanted to teach you the ways of the world! - The way they really are! But you're not worthy! - You're just like all the rest of them! Meat! - Stupid! Meat! - What is that stuff? - It's purifying you, if that's possible! - You! I was always getting to eat you! - Hey! Hold still! or I'll cut your balls off and make you watch! - Lillith, for the love of God ... - God? Whose God? - Yours? He's just a figment for the hopeless! - What's he done for you lately? - This! - Hurry!
