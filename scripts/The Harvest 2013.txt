Eyes on the batter. - Watch the batter. - Fielders get ready. Look straight, hon. - Strike 2! - Yeah, nice goin'. You got it. Good job, Bobby. Good job. Right over the plate. There you go. One more. Come on. You got it. - Bobby? - Please, let me through. I'm his mom. Let me through. Bobby? Please go call an ambulance. Please. Bobby, you need to breathe. Please breathe. Please just... - How are his vitals? - He's crashing. Your son is going to be okay. Thank you, Dr. Young. Thank you for savin' my boy. Is no longer available to take your call. - Baby? - I'm fine. I'm fine. Did you get out of bed? A bird was eating my corn and I... I had to scare it off. Breathe for me. Deep breath. And again. I don't like how you sound. Hey. Can I just say I hate doctors? This guy today, made me wait for over an hour to sign off on my samples and then acts like I'm wasting his time. What's the difference between God and a doctor? I don't know. What? God doesn't think he's a doctor. So... how's he feeling? He's tough, but he's getting weaker. What's the plan? She's got him on this new medicine regimen. That's why I've been bothering you so much. It's no bother. I like coming here to see you. I just wanna help you get through this. It kills me to see him... sitting there in that little room while his life passes him by. Better? I'm still a little tired but I feel... I feel fine. Get some rest. Is he having any seizures? You know, because this is... She's got his treatment plan all worked out. Okay. I'm sure she does. But... this is an adult dosage, so please be very careful. Well, thanks for doing this. It takes a lot of pressure off of me. Your welcome. I just am happy to help you. Help... help your son. And destroy the box bottoms if you could. They have the lot numbers on 'em that can trace back to me. I'll be in the city soon, so I'll give you a call. Okay. Come on, honey. We're here. Maryann, wake up. We're home. - You're gonna hurt your back. - No. I got this. Damn. I guess she does take after her father. I hope not. I don't think I have enough energy for that. We ordered you a new mattress. It'll be here soon. When are my friends being shipped here? Oh, yeah, your friends. Well, there's not a lot of room here for them. We left the computer however. You start school on Monday. You're gonna meet a whole bunch of new friends. I liked my old friends. I'll go get the rest of your stuff from the back of the car. We know it's hard. We miss your parents too. Keep your bones strong. I'm sorry, it took longer than I expected. Well, wash up. We're ready to eat. Andy, your napkin. Sorry. Excuse me. It's the hospital. Hello? Hi. - Where'd you go today? - I had to meet up with an old friend. - Someone you used to work with? - Yeah. - Another nurse? - Yeah. Something like that. - What did you do? Homework? - Mom didn't think I was feeling up to it. She gave me a pass. So I know she won't flunk me. I wouldn't put it past her. Don't repeat that. You'll get me in trouble. - I have to pee. - You need help? No. - Where'd he go? - Bathroom. Alone? He'll be fine. What took you so long anyway? Sandra was like... She gave us a good amount, though. It should last a while. Well, we'll see, because I had to increase his dosage again today. - She said to watch how much you give him. - I don't need advice from a drug rep. - She was just... - She's just what? Now, you tell her I've got it under control. I'm the doctor. Mom! Mom! I'm sorry. - I lost my balance. - It's okay. Looks like the bleeding stopped. Alright, Andy. This is gonna sting, okay? You're in my light. - Do you feel that? - Yeah. - You want more cream? - No, no. I'm okay. I'm sorry he let you go alone. It was my idea. I wanted to go alone... 'cause I need to build my strength up. Okay. We're all done here. Alright, you can clean him up. Will I be able to go outside and play catch? I don't think so. No. Dad promised. Well, that was before he let you crack your head open. I'm going to get you some antibiotics, okay? Congratulations on your first set of stitches. It wasn't that bad. Maryann, don't go too far. I'm fixing lunch. - Did you get everything? - Whatever was on the list. - You didn't even check on him. - How could I? I just walked in. - He had a bad morning. - What happened? - He couldn't breathe. - Well, that's a side effect of the dosage. - No, I want to stay aggressive. - Oh, dammit! Why are you mad at me? You undermine everything I say. I really don't understand you sometimes. You keep pushing me away, and I'm all you've got. I'm sorry. I just... I just want him to get better. I know. Me too. How is your head? It doesn't hurt now. I'm just tired. - You've played enough for today. - Just one more inning left. - You two okay? - We're fine. - Andy, you need anything? - No. Sleeve. Look at me. This will make you feel a lot better. Okay? You had a long sleep. I'm still tired. Getting better takes a lot out of you. Can I go outside today? You have enough stitches in your head. - I have to go out. - Okay. But later on... we'll do some school work. I can't wait. If you don't study, you'll grow up to be a nurse. - Like Dad? - Exactly. - Hi. - Hi. I like your room. Nice toys. They're... they're collector's items. I don't actually play with them. You should've kept them in the package then. They'd be worth more. So do you live around here? Yeah. Do you want me to come in? Alright. You okay? You can't walk? I'll be able to soon. Just have to get stronger. - Can I sit in it or is that weird? - Go ahead. I'm Maryann. Andy. I'm new, so... I guess you're my first friend. I've lived here all my life and you're my first friend too. There's no other kids around here at all? - None that I know. - What about school? I don't go to school. You're lucky. I start tomorrow. You wanna play Xbox? One, one pitch. Price with strike 2. - That was outside. - It caught the outside corner. - No way. - Can't argue with the computer. Andy, what's going on here? - This is Maryann. - Hi. That's bull. Hi, Maryann. How did you get in here? - I let her in. - The window. It was nice to meet you, Maryann. We're not finished playing. Okay. Bye, Andy. Bye. - Thanks for having me over, Mrs... - Dr. Young. - Take care, Maryann. - Bye. Who was that? Maryann. When I leave you in charge would you actually mind checking on him once in a while? I did. He was fine. But you were completely unaware that he had somebody in this house. I didn't let her in. I know. You're oblivious. I've never seen a school bus go by before. Show me again how you got to this point. Today was her first day. Great. How was school today? Your bed came. - I'm going out to play. - Dinner is in 1 hour. 5 o'clock. I know. Hey. My mom doesn't like strangers coming in through the window. Hi, Mr. Young. You must be Maryann. - Can Andy play for a little while? - He's sleepin'. No, he's... he's awake. I saw him through the window. Well, I guess if he's awake you can come in for a little bit. See, he is asleep. You should let him rest. He's faking it. You're a jerk. That's where I get my shots. Oh, sorry. So I heard the school bus go by today. How was it? The worst. When do you go back to school? When you're better? - I don't. I'm home schooled. - You're so lucky. That school sucks. - I wish I could go to regular school. - You're not missing anything, but I guess you must get bored just sitting here all day. I want to learn how to play baseball but... - my mom won't let me. - What's the big deal? She's worried. I'm getting weaker. - What's with the garden? - It's my corn. I watch it grow. Oh, and I thought you weren't having any fun. I have to keep the birds away or else they'll eat it. Well, maybe we can just put something there to scare them off. I can just tap on the glass and they fly away. What about a scarecrow? Nah. Let's just play baseball. Fine, but... I'm not going easy on you just 'cause you're on a wheelchair. Here you go. - What inning? - Top of the 7th. A stretch. Let's finish this game and call it a day, okay? Okay, Mr. Young. Thank you. How are you feeling today? I'm gonna run a few more tests, okay? Hey, look at me for a sec. You've got that look in your eyes. No, I don't. I had that look, your father had it. You're up to something. I don't know what you're talking about. Far out. - Is... is Andy home? - Yes, of course Andy's home. We're gonna make a scarecrow. It'll keep the birds away. I know what a scarecrow does. Okay, well... could you please tell Andy that I came by? 'Cause, I don't want him to think that... Goodbye, Maryann. Where do you think he should go? Just... right... right at the edge. Facing you? No, his back should be towards the house. What do you think we should name him? I don't know. What's your mom's name? That looks good. Andy? What are you doing? I need you to go home. How do you feel today? Fine. Thank you. I'm really sorry about this. You know this acting out behavior, it's probably just displaced emotions. You know she doesn't know who to be angry at. What makes you think she's angry? I made it perfectly clear that Andy wasn't up to playing, but she wouldn't listen. She's in a new place, she's just... she's just trying to find a friend. We have her set to see the psychologist at school. It'll be good for her to have a professional to speak with. Maybe so... but she still needs to have a friend. I know it's hard for Maryann right now. Really? But I think I need to let you know that Andy is dying. We are so sorry to hear that, Katherine. Losing James, Maryann's dad was... was the hardest thing that we have ever faced. Still facing. Hi, Dr. Young. Hello, Maryann. I should be getting back to Andy. What are you doing? Maybe soon I can go out to play with Maryann. Her grandparents and I agreed it's probably not a good idea. Why? Pathogens. It's time to eat. Can you walk me into the kitchen? Dad says that if I wanna get my legs stronger I have to practice walking. I don't think so. Hi, Maryann. - What're you... - Homework. What did Andy's mom want? That's what I wanna talk to you about. Well, she just came over to introduce herself. Did she say why she didn't like me? She likes you just fine. She's... she's just concerned for her son. He's very sick. And he doesn't have much energy these days. - He seems fine to me. - Well, he isn't. - I don't want you latch on to this boy. - He's my friend. There must other kids at school that you could play with. This isn't fair. I mean... I finally make a friend around here and now I'm not allowed to hang out with him? Fine, whatever. His liver is failing. With the amount of toxins in his body, what do you expect? I don't expect this. He's overly medicated. I've been telling you to slow it down. - Is that your diagnosis? - I know you're the doctor. Yeah. And I'm not a wait-and-see kinda doctor, alright? I'm proactive and I... I'm sticking to this treatment plan. Then you have to take me into the train on your way in. Why? Sandra is not gonna come all the way out here. I need to meet her. Okay. She's doing us a big favor. Please don't leave him alone for too long. I'll make sure he has the cordless. Yes. Those were your dad's gloves. Can I use 'em? Do you wanna play catch? Well, I met a new kid at school that wants to play. Sure. Don't lose them. Where'd your parents go? What are you doing here? I have a surprise for you. I'm not allowed. - Where's your coat? - I don't have a coat. Put this on. I'm not allowed to go outside unsupervised... in a robe. You're with me. It's fine. My mom isn't gonna like this. Open it. Oh, my God. They were my dad's when he was a kid. Okay. Get the phone from my room. Wait, wait. Can't we just play catch in the porch? Well, I don't think you'd be able to explain a broken window. My mom said that you wouldn't be coming by anymore. She told my grandmother I should leave you alone. - Why? - It's probably the sexual tension. What? You're so uptight. Put your mitt on. - Do you think it's because I'm dying? - I wouldn't worry about that right now. I would focus on this ball I'm about to throw at your face. Don't throw it too hard. Can you come a little closer? This is my first time. Are you ready? Maybe we can make you a hockey goalie instead. You have to open your hand. Nice. Now throw it back. Alright. You're doing good. I mean... you throw like a girl, but we can work on that. Hello? Oh, hi, mom. Yeah... every... everything is fine. Okay. Bye. She's on her way home. We have to hurry. Hurry, she'll be here any minute. Pull. Pull. - I can't get the wheels up. - Turn me around. One, two, three. I moved my leg. Maybe being scared of your mom helps. Hello? Oh, my God! Hello? What happened? You getting feisty again? - What happened? - I don't know. He must have pulled it out. And... he's getting his strength back. Well, I suppose that's a positive sign. He's getting better. Get me one of those. What? Thank you. What about his liver? I'm sorry... I need you to clean that up. You're gonna take a shower because you smell like her. - Was someone here when I was gone? - No. Well, then who put the phone on the charger? I did. So you just got up for the first time and decided to put the phone on the charger? Yes. Show me. - Do it again. - I can't, I... Sure you can. I want you to get up out of bed and show me how you put the phone on the charger for the first time! I'm sorry. I'll be damned... if I'm gonna let you treat me this way! Wait! She's only using you for your video games anyway! Katherine, that's enough. - Leave him alone! Leave him alone! - Katherine... - Don't touch him! - Katherine. - He is a rotten little liar! - Katherine... - He is lying to me. - Okay. You need to walk away. Okay? You need to walk away. Mom... - You're not such a big boy now, are you? - Katherine! Mom! You need to take a breath. You're loosing it. He's lying to me. It doesn't matter. You can't treat him like that. - I know she was in this house. - Good for him! You don't even care. We're all making sacrifices here. What have you ever sacrificed? I stopped working so I could take care of him. No, you quit your job so you could stay at home and get drunk and do nothing, that's what you did. I have taken care of him his whole life. What do you expect? Children are for life. Really? You okay? - I didn't do anything wrong. - Oh, Jesus. Sorry. Maryann took me outside to play catch. You didn't want to tell your mother about that. No. I didn't want to get Maryann in trouble. She was just trying to be nice. I know. It's good to have someone to talk to. Isn't it? Why is it such a big deal when she comes over? Well... when this all blows over I'll ask your mom if... Maryann can come by some day. Okay? Let's just give it some time. Thanks. "Salinger, though I think he is listening, seems preoccupied. "He draws yellow lines on the map, but I follow them. "What do you do?", counters Jerry. "I don't hear you babbling on about the joys of barn cleaning "or pouring anhydrous ammonia on your stubble or whatever else you do." How much of his liver does he need? - It's just a little part of the left lobe. - Just? It's a simple procedure. It'll grow back. We could've avoided this. If we don't do it now... he'll be dead within a month. I have to go. - Where now? - Oh, you know... running around, doing nothing. My usual. Mom, what are you doing? Right. I forgot. You wanna play baseball? I don't know what you're talking about. You wanna play baseball? Do I play baseball? Mom? No. Please, don't. - Mom, mom! I'm sorry, please. - You wanna lie to me? You wanna lie to your mother. Andy. You lied to me! - What's this? - Don't. Stop. Close the window. Close the window! Close the window now! - How you doing? - Andy's mother is crazy. - See. - Sweetie. They have another boy in the basement and I think they kidnapped him. You know, you just can't go sayin' things like that. But I have proof. Look. I think you should take a break from the computer and read a book. Are you upset about this? About us? No. It was... it was nice, you're very nice. You know, she doesn't appreciate you. I've tried. It just doesn't work. You know, if you need a place to stay... No. I can't leave Andy. Yeah, I know. Thing I love about you is the thing that keeps you away. All we do is exist to sustain him. It isn't good for any of us. You know, it might be better for him if you separated. - Kids pick up on bad vibes and... - We don't fight in front of him. Okay, okay. I'm not pushing. Thank you. I have to go. Go. What the hell are you doing? You know, he had an opportunity to tell me the truth and he chose to protect her. I want you to stop this. Katherine. Katherine, Katherine. He didn't do anything. He didn't do anything wrong. Okay? No, he did. You weren't home. He is a liar and he is a little cheat. - I won't have it in my house. - I slept with Sandra. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I didn't... I didn't mean... - You and... What do you wanna do? I don't know. I... I don't know. I... I can't... I can't take... - I can't take this. - Okay. I can't take this anymore. - I'm sorry... - You don't love me anymore? I love you, Katherine. I love you. What are we gonna do? What me and Andy are gonna do if you go? I won't leave. I won't leave. - You're not gonna leave? - No. No, no. I won't leave him. - Him? I meant me. - I know. Hey, it's me and you. Me, Andy and our little family. I love you. Come here. I'm sorry, but I understand. I'm not a monster. I forgive you. I forgive you. Hey, listen. You gonna stay? Yeah? - Yes, yes. I will. - We've gotta start prepping for surgery. I'm gonna go check on him. Get some sleep. Goodnight. Oh, my God. It's getting cold out. You should wait for the bus inside. I'm fine. Well, I'm cold. Hey, champ. You're probably wondering what the heck happened. Well, we had an emergency last night. It was your appendix. But your mother took care of it. My side hurts. I know. It's gonna. I'll get you something for the pain, okay? I have to talk to you. My dad, he... This won't help you wake up but it'll take care of the pain. Let's take a look at those stitches. What are you doing? Katherine! - Why are you doing this? - There's a draft. Don't worry about this, okay? I'll be right back. Get some rest. Your parents have someone in the basement. There's a kid down there. Hooked up to all these machines. I think he's dying too. I have a brother? I have a brother? No, I don't think so, but... his name is Jason Kimanick. What? I think they kidnapped him. Read this. No. Go home, please. Were you in that house again? The school called. You were absent today. - Go to your room... - No, grandma, please... Your grandfather will drive you to school from now on. And you will stay inside this house after school. Do you understand? I'm sorry. It won't happen again. I know it won't. You're grounded. Hey. Look what I got. - Thanks. - No problem. - How you feeling? - It just hurts. Hi, Mom. Katherine, he said hi. - How's it looking? - As well as can be expected. I'm sorry about... Don't worry about it. Why'd you stop having kids after me? Is it because I came out sick? Andy. God only gave us one child to love and take care of. And you were all we needed to make a family. Hey. Don't worry about it. It doesn't matter. What's your name? I'm Andy. Can you hear me? I just got my appendix out. How... how long have you been down here? Andy. Andy, what... How did... how did you... What are you doing down here? No. No, you have to... you have to come with me. - Let's get you upstairs. - Dad. - Why did... why did you lie to me? - Okay. He's very sick, Andy. Why... why is it such a secret? He's dying, Andy. He's dying. And your mother felt that... you shouldn't be subjected to that. We didn't think that you would get any better laying next to another sick boy. Alright? I want to know him. You can't. You can't know him. He does not exist. He does not exist to you. Okay? Your mother... your mother cannot find out about this. We need to get you upstairs. Wait. Is he... is he my brother? No. Then please, Dad. - Please just tell me what's going on here. - Andy, we need to get you to bed right now. - Stop. Wait, what about him? - He'll be fine. Oh, God. Andy. - Is he okay? - Yes. Yeah, he'll be fine. I just found him down here. I don't... I don't know. - Mom, please. - I don't know what... Please. Who is he? - Hey, let's go back. - Stop. - Mom. - No. Mom! Mom, who is he? He's my son. Oh, God. If he... if he's your son... who am I? Who am I? Play ball! School night, you know. They're gonna give Jason's heart to Andy. Is that what you really think? Why won't anyone believe me? When I was a kid, I had friends that I wasn't allowed to hang out with. But that didn't stop me. Follow your heart, Maryann. Follow your heart. Andy, wake up. You're in trouble, please wake up. I need to talk to you. Help me. Katherine. Please stop. Please. Look, we both knew this day would come. So, that's it? We just take his heart? Andy, are you okay? - I saw... I saw him. - What? You went down there? Yeah. Your parents kidnapped Jason. They're not my parents. What? I'm... I'm not Andy. The boy... he... he's Andy. You're the one they kidnapped from the hospital? - I'm Jason. - Okay. We have to get you out of here. He's still a person. How can you dismiss that? I'm not dismissing anything. But Jason Kimanick is not our son. But he's a boy. He's just a boy and despite everything we've done to him, I... I don't want him to die. He's not dying. He's not dying. He's saving our son. Clear. Go bring him down. Mommy's gonna make you all better. Hurry, Richard! Hurry! I am. - Leave him alone. - No. I am not gonna hurt him. Well, then let us go. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I lied to you. For so long, I know it's... it's unforgivable. I know. I never had... I never thought... I never thought... I'm so sorry for everything. I need you to trust me. - No. No. - No. It's epinephrine, it's adrenaline. It'll give him the energy he needs to get out of here. - Put that needle down! - Please, Maryann. - Put it down! - Maryann! Put the needle down! No, no, no! - No, no! - Andy, I promise. It'll take time and a lot of work, but you'll get your strength back. No! Andy? Andy. Maryann, let's get him out of here. Come on, come on. Go! Quick! - Where is he? Where he'd go? - It's over, Katherine. He's gone. No, where... What are you doing? Where is he? - No, where is he? Where is he gone? - He's gone. That's it. Let's go. - No. He'll die without him. - I know. He's gonna die! He's gonna die! - Richard, he's gonna die without him. - Listen to me, Katherine. He's been dead a long time. He's been dead... such a long time. We have to let him go. I love you. Andy! Andy! Andy! Okay. Come on. - Will you just stand. - I can't. But you have to! You have to! Please, just help me out. One step at a time. You got it. Okay. You got this. We're almost there. Where'd you go? You think you can just leave? And you! Didn't I tell you to stay away from my house? Andy, it is time to go home! I need you to come here now! If you can walk there, you can walk back! Now look! Look what you've done! Look what you've done! Look what you've done! No! No! Andy! My baby! No! Richard! Richard! Richard! Andy! Andy! Is she gone? I think so. Strike. - Eyes on the ball. - Right, come on. - Two-O, Two-O. - Don't worry, she can hit this. Keep your eye on the ball, Maryann. Yes. Got it. Far out.
