German nationals engage in prostitution, they encourage polygamy... they harbor dangerous political convictions. Are you aware of the Espionage Act of 1916? You think she's a spy? Well, I'll tell you what's in her favor She's not Chinese. Nice day though. - [Grunts] - [Frandsen Mutters] Olaf, come on. Help the lady. - [Norwegian] - Ja. - Ducky. - Ah, ducky.

Inge she makes good coffee. Not like the women in church. It's too black. Too many beans. Waste of beans. - Does she make you coffee often? - Yeah. Uh, no. Um, uh Do you find comfort here? Mmm, uh Uh, good here. Not like Frandsen house. Where do you sleep? I sleep in the barn. [Inge] Uh, this. Oh, yes. These are the letters from the minister in Osnabrck. The papers? Immigrations? But You're dancing together. You're living together. God only knows what else. - What else? - I sleep in the barn. Your Germaness is It's a bad influence. Your Germaness it's a disruption to my community. Your Germaness it makes coffee that is too black. [Sorrensen] It is harvest time. A time when we must work together... prosper together, or suffer alone. Let me read to you from Corinthians, chapter five... verses nine through 13. "I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people; "not to associate with any so-called brother ifhe is an immoral person... "or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler. Those who are from outside God judges." I am troubled. I believe in a God who believes in love and compassion... and I believe in a God who believes in forgiveness. [Exhales] But I also find comfort in a moral code. I find comfort in a righteous path... and I believe in a God who teaches me to walk along it. [Man Coughing] And when Inge Altenberg... first arrived in our community... I was fearful of her differences... but I had hoped that she would join us on our path. Inge Altenberg and Olaf Torvik they're not married. Now I find them dancing together... sharing the same quarters, perhaps the same bed. And she is making coffee for him in the morning. You cannot choose to live like that... and also to join with us. The rest of you... do not allow your good lives to be poisoned by these two. I'm not listening to what the minister's talking about. - You've been my friend ever since you got here. - You can't harvest alone. - You need these people. Harmo's steam thresher - It'll all work out. Frandsen, you've thrown yourself into debt with your damn Ford, big tractor and magic lantern. - It'll work out. - You're not gonna have a farm much longer. Brownie's gonna have to work in a factory for the rest of her life. - You're trying to pick a fight now. - You're not a farmer. You're a fool. Your bigger, better, faster - [All Gasp] - [Groans] [Ducks Squawking] You believes God? Something makes the crops come up. Ja. But not church. NotJesus. [Sniffs] Mmm. - Smell. - Smell, yes. Smell this. And sun Mmm. - Feel. - Ja. Feel the sun. Feel this. [Ducks Squawking] You have Trume? Dreams. Dreams. Yes, you have? I have work. I don't have dreams. [Grunts] Grouse have dreams. Ducks. Grouse, pheasants all have dreams. But not you. Ducks don't have dreams. It gets cold. They fly south. [Ducks Squawking] [Squawking Continues] [Duck Squawking] Inge. I go. Don't. Ducks dream. I know. [No Audible Dialogue] Watch the ankles. Six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Good. Come. Six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Good. Come. Here, take. Put the bottoms down together. Take. Good. Now lay them down. Here. You tie in the middle. Good. One, two, three, four... five, six, seven, eight... nine, 10, to a hundred. Come. Tie this one. Here, I'll put the string. Quickly. Good. Okay. I know. I do. You go. Good work. [Record Scratching] [Phonograph Cranking] [Classical] [Continues] [Continues] [Ends] Good horse. [Bell Ringing In Distance] [Man Shouting, Indistinct] Come! Inge! Giddap! Whoa! [Man Shouting, Indistinct] Inside, I found a Griswold combination meat and food chopper... a Richardson perfect baby's crib [Continues, Indistinct] Look at that. They're auctioning the baby's crib. And at this time, I'll turn it over to Palmer... - and he'll give you the specifics on the property. - Well, as many of you know Look at the suit this guy's wearing. Any of you guys own a suit like that? [LaMotte] ...the condition of this mortgage. And, uh, as of now, I will give you the legal description of the property to be sold. It's 160 acres, more or less... Iocated on the northeast quarter of section 11... township 45, range 30 How many kids does he have? - He's got nine kids. - Nine kids. Thank you, Palmer.

Sold at 7,000 to the gentleman right here. Would you give me your name, please? - OlafTorvik. - Would you step forward here? I don't have $7,000. I know. [Car Engine Starts] [Car Departs] Is there a problem, Olaf? This is a legal action. I don't have 7,000. - I see you finished your harvest. - Yeah. Well, it won't pay for this farm. I mean, you might get, what, 1,200 at most? - I know. - Where's this rest then? In a pickle jar somewhere? No. Why did you do this then? I just did it. Congratulations. You now own Frandsen's farm. If you don't pay for it in 24 hours... I'll own your farm, which is a better piece of land anyway. But I can help you out. With a mortgage? Sure. Banking and farming don't mix. Did you see that socialist drug out of here? Yah! Thanks. WhatWhat happen now? The sheriff come. [Car Approaching] [Car Doors Opening, Closing] [Knocking] [Knocking] Come in. We kept enough for winter and planting. Good night. I still think your coffee is a little black. [Man] My eldestlost in the war. [Sorrensen] I'm sorry. For me, these letters don't provide sufficient evidence... that this woman is not a troublemaker. We have no birth certificate, no history. Just some noncommittal comments and anecdotes and pleasantries. I can't take the risk. Not with what has happened in Russia recently. - Russia? - Mmm. Look at this. This comes from the mind of a dangerous man. I found that in church, tucked in my hymnal. We just want only to be married. [Sorrensen] Come on, Alden. These are simple farmers with honest dreams. Give them the papers so that they can get married. I'm sorry. This is her place now. How can it be? You can let it be. You don't have the papers. Now... I am married. I am citizenship. In my heart, I believe. But that's not enough, Inge in your heart to believe. It has to be real. You believes God? All right. [Exhales] In my heart. See you both on Sunday.
