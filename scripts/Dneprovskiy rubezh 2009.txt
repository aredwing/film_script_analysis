Release the suspect. Now. Do it! Group for the counterattack, move out! Comrade Komdiv, we're landing. THE DNJEPR LINE - I immediately noticed her at dance. - Yes? - Yes. Everyone looked at her. And she chose me. - We got married last year. - She is beautiful. - As an actress. What's going on here? Staff front retreats. To Smolensk. There are commanders of regiments. - Attention! - At ease. Three lines of defense. Trenches, anti-tank trenches. War commissioner Kuznjecov reporting. Comrade Komdiv, 15 000 citizens were employed to do engineering works. BOBRUJSKI PATH, VILLAGE BUJNICH Deploy strong unit near Drut river. I think it might be direction most endangered by tanks. Not knowing the whole situation, you know which direction is most endangered by tanks? Comrade General, commander of 388th Regiment, Colonel Shadrin. Allow me to report. We send scouts on Babruysk's and Minsk's path and Jamshcic area, Dolgij, i Dashkovka. - Whose sector is that? - Mine. Create a strong battalion unit. And send it there tonight, in trucks. 5. JULY 1941. MINSKI PATH, LAHVA RIVER Move, soldiers. Don't be afraid. Give me your revolver. Your husband? No, we met on the train. He was talking about his wife when they shoot him. My name is Zoja. Zoja Sjemcova. We spotted the German unit three kilometers from here. Commander, the German unit is spotted three kilometers from here. Gather up all the documents. Move. - Come with me. Come with me! - Don't yell at me. Second brigade, start your shift. Positions should be completed before Germans come. Maybe that won't necessary. What do you mean? Well, anti-tank trenches are our entire position. Today HQ received information that we are making a great concentration of our forces in the next few days, in the region of Syenno, there will be a large-scale counterattack. - Syenno.. We are fighting the Germans with a bullet and bombs, stabbing them with bayonets. There is no land for the Germans here, but there is place for Germans under ground. Finally, it began. Take your positions! Take your positions! Move! Faster! Move! Sjemcova! Is he alive? Hide Quickly, help lieutenant! Go, Commander! Lean on me! We activated vanguard, and while the enemy regroup, we withdraw to the previously prepared position. Quick, guys! Hurry! We need luck, no time to prepare, I trust in your evaluation about the readiness of our troops. Saboteurs! Shoot! They will escape, faster! Planes! Take cover! Stay still! At ease. You still think that in this situation counterattack will be successful? Comrade Komdiv, at Mirni direction the Germans are entered the Bjelince. After air preparation, Comrade Komdiv, The Germans attacked our defense on the left side of the Lahve river. That was close. We should change the position of HQ and enhance defense. Saboteurs are behind every corner. Understood, Comrade Komdiv! - From first lines? How is there? - Corpses.. I have wounded soldier. And she chose me. Excuse me, do I know you? No. - Ana. - Zoja. Let's see your wounded soldier. There is some heavy fights on Shklovsky path, Comrade Komdiv. - Send the scouts. - Understood, Comrade Komdiv. - We need to constantly attack enemy's vanguard. - Yes, sir. Stop! At night they went on position, by the wall. They did't know what is waiting for them. And she was completely blue, that cow which fled to the village! Stop laughing! Hurry up with the digging! Laugh when the Germans come! When the Germans come he'll first shit his pants. - What are you doing here? - Where should I dig? You stuck with people, right? Do you have any document? - You're a comedian? - So they say. OK, comedian. We go to the commander. Listen here, in my hand is a bottle. Bottle with a flammable mixture. - How strong? - As strong as it should be to destroy the tank. - There is one sensitive place on the tank. - Same as with my wife. - How did you find it? - And how did you? - All women are like that. I had one, you know.. when this occurs, they are all pioneers. And so! Who's bored, may continue with laughing! But, the Germans will come and this will be your eyes! And then no one will know what to do! - And if you hit the turret, there is no damage. Understand? - Clearly, Comrade Sergeant! The infantry troops left their positions on the Lahve river and retreated to the previously prepared positions in area of Prisna One or Inga. Cannonade on the north, you know what that means? The Germans force the Dnjepr, which means the Vitebsk has been abandoned. If so, which I doubt. Why didn't we get a report about that. Neither Sovietinformbiro didn't report anything. You really believe that Sovietinformbiro will immediately report something about that? Well, of course.. Commander of the railways, Lieutenant Levinkov. Armenian. The shipment to Germany. - How many? - Well, at least 40 boxes. Cognac. Armenian. In our country? Our factory needs bottles for flammable mixtures. Bottle dimensions are appropriate. - You've thought of that, or someone consulted you? - I have ordered. - Any contact with the Vitebsk? - No. Not since this morning. Comrade Zigunov.. - A young tank destroyer unit. - At ease, boy. We work like this: You raise a moral of the soldiers and commanders, and for the rest of the Division I'm in charge. And one more thing. Poure cognac into canisters and deliver it to the HQ. Yes, yes, in HQ. Poure flammable mixture in bottles. We'll not spill cognac on the ground. Sorry, but what are you going to do with it? Drink. For victory. Here are our positions. And here we can run into an ambush. Be careful, guys. I draw your attention to mask your positions for reconnaissance from air and ground. Not to mention the fact that the enemy tanks on the front end of the defense perform continuous monitoring of our combat units and positions that are not masked. People leaving the shelters, walking the fields, riding horses to the front lines. It is a misdemeanor! The soldiers must be masked so that even you can not notice them. Do you see this! Whose are these people? Go back! Go back now! Samurai? Back! Back immediately! Back! Go, go! Go. Samurai. That is how we called Commander after Halhin Hola. Killed five Japanese soldiers with bare hands. Don't believe me? True story. Rewarded. Stalin asked: Gregory, how was it? I killed five samurai in the fight. So you are then samurai yourself. Comrade Stalin called him a samurai. Since then he is called samurai. Samurai. And one time.. 10. JULY 1941. BARKALABOVO-SLEDZUK TERRAIN Where? - South, in 187th Division zone. - Also, west of Shklova. Under the protection of mortar and artillery fire, with the active interaction of aviation, the opponent is on the whole front 18th shooting division began forcing of Dnjepr. That is why, Comrade Komdiv, defense lines of 18th and 53th divisions are in a very serious situation. Unfortunately, communication with them has been lost. Crossing Barkalabova area, the Germans are actively trying to expand bridge defense. Connect with me Shadrin. The Germans crossed the Dnjepr river. Hello, Orle. Take action against the group in the Barkalabova area. Yes, and help as much as you can from your shore. - Captain Davidov, in your presence. - Lt. Peshivanov, in your presence. Davidov! Take your battalion and go to Dashkovk area. By the Borsuk station. Lt. Peshivanov will command in defense sector. - Understood. - Go. - Understood. - Understood. Do you notice anything? No refugees. It's quiet. Attention! For transport. How are we doing with medicines? - Hello, Comrade General. - Are there enough bandages? - Can we take a look? - Sure, let's go. Here are easy wounded. The seriously wounded are sent in military hospital after the surgery. Here is the operating room. Very good. Perfect condition. - Zoja, you are very talented for surgery. - I love it. I have always wanted to be a surgeon. - Hippocrates said.. - War is the best school for surgeons. - Exactly. That's all, Zojenjka. Put crates with ammunition in another vehicle. Come, soldiers, a little faster. Combat report. Young anti-tank defense battalion commanders, made a mutual agreement on socialist competition and pledged not to miss even one fascist tank on its defense sector. Is this your idea? I thought that the concept of socialist competition is forgotten during the Finnish campaign. Foolishness. Choose your words, and explain what you mean. You want me to explain? Two officers are organizing the competition. At the same battle. Battle starts, lots of shooting, one of them bravely lead battle, and other thinks: it's important not to lose the competition, I will later, when the opponent is weak, go ahead and win with fewer casualties. The competition is more important than the orders.. It's nonsense, Comrade Zigunov. - It's not nonsense, but good leadership. Your thinking is, I think, devastating. There shouldn't be any competition. Orders of the commander is not subject to discussion and should be done. This applies to all of us. Without exception. - Where is Captain David? - God knows. Constantly attacking the enemy vanguard. Constantly. Spread around! Take cover! 11. JULY 1941. BOBRUJSK PATH, BUJNICH VILLAGE Enemy attack on the entire front. After an intense bombardment, supported by artillery in the area of the village Bujnich the second line of defense Shadrina, observers and reports that the opponent infantry and tanks regrouped and approaching from the Bichovski direction. What about the destruction of bridgehead on the left side of the river? Kirile Jurjevichu relax a little, Zoja and I will finish that. - The hardest part is done. - I'll take a nap. Wake me after 30 minutes. Or immediately if something is urgent. Don't worry, Kirile Jurjevichu. I dreamed a nice dream. When I woke up, I wanted to remain in a dream. It seemed like Serjozha was watching me. I looked out the window, and there he is.. standing, smiles at me. I ran out, no one is there. He remembers me. Let me tell you my dream. I dance at a ball. Pretty couples around me. Don't say with who, with him? Faster, soldiers, faster! On the line! Faster, guys! Quick! Give me a missile! - Missile, missile! - Load it. One more! Quick! Sasha! Sanjok, Sanjok, look at me.. - Zojka, rest a bit, take a fresh air, breathe. - I'm fine, chloroform.. - Ana, help her. - What's wrong? - I'm fine. - Go. Zoja! Komdiv? Hello, Comrade Komdiv! What is.. Let's go. Incidentally, I saw your picture. He came to the institute. On 8th March. - Hello, Comrade General. - You saw this? - Yes. They flanked us and got in front of our artillery fire. - And your troops? - Large losses. Higher than expected. - Captain Davidov battalion was destroyed. - I know. Regardless, well done job, Colonel. They hit their heads against the wall. I worked with their own tactics. How so? General Guderian, before the war, wrote a book about tanks there are a lot of useful information. She is, Comrade General, spent the whole battle in the anti-tank trench. They left her behind. What's your name? - Look for the civilians who were digging a trench. Find her parents. - Yes, sir. - Take her to the kitchen and give her something to eat. - Yes, sir. - So, you say you use Guderians book to destroy these tanks? - Exactly. You're smart. And such is not progressing further than the captain - Speak German? - Yes. - That's good. Who doesn't know the language of the enemy, risk to lose his own. - It's true. - How many tanks were destroyed? - 20, Comrade General. - 20? - Yes. I counted them personally. - Tell the quartermaster to deliver 20 bottles of cognac. Give the bottle of cognac to anyone who destroyed a tank. Comrade General, corporal Kisiljov destroyed four tanks. He'll drink too much. - In that case, Pjotre Kuzmichu, you decide. - There he is, corporal Kisiljov. Let's go there. - Stand still! - At ease, at ease. Sit. Sit, Kisiljov. Feel free to sit down. Well, how's it going, corporal? - So, so. - Where you learn to shoot like that? Hunter? I am not a hunter. I've always been good at shooting. - It's a bit of luck. - Was it bad? Well.. I wanted to make a new house, old one nearly collapsed.. When they came.. destroying everything. I have faild to build a new house. Three children, one on the way.. Wife, old mother, daughters. Where will we live? You're a hero, corporal. Hero. For the victory. I already see the headline: Day of fire! Eat, Comrade Journalist. - Gensepaschtette. What is it? - Goose pate. Not edible. What do you think, Comrade Colonel, What will happen tomorrow in your sector? Dnjepr is forced. They expand their bridgehead. In the south and the north. Pour Comrades, pour. If the Supreme HQ does not organize well-prepared offensive and as usual if they switch divisions around, we will be surrounded. Surrounded? You think the Germans have enough forces to surround such a powerful military group that is under our command? I think we will be witnesses and participants in major offensive operation. We will fight them off and we'll get to Berlin. To Comrade Stalin. Armenian cognac. Five stars. Well..for boys. What do you think, will we die tomorrow? No. Not yet. No? We will for sure. They will die. Everyone will die. This is for you. Flowers? - Congratulations. - For what? - Birthday. Ah, yes. Congratulations. Thank you. May I kiss you? But I.. I haven't shaved. I will endure it. Ok, then. The day of birth is worse than the day of death. Why do you say that? Not me. Eklezijast. You have read it? - No. - A wise book. Only after reading I have no will to live. Then don't read it. Good advice. - Yes, Comrade Prvi? - Happy birthday. - Thank you. - Best wishes. - Did someone congratulate you already? - No, you are first. Thank you. Prvi congratulated. Well Prvi(Prvi=First), loves to be first, enjoys being the first. Which is the first birthday that you remember? Five years. Five.. - Yes? - The Germans started to bomb positions in the region Burnich and Vikjer. - I think there will be an attack. - Report to me when they start. And you.. You.. You.. Zoja. Zoja Sjemcova. Good morning. And you, Zoja Sjemcova, go to the hospital. Forget about it. In the evening go freely, without fear. Already receiving guests? The tanks broke through our positions.. Artillery is silent.. 12. JULY 194l. BOBRUJSKI PATH, VILLAGE BUJNICH Give!

This is treason! What happens? Are they all familiar with the commands? Not everyone, comrade Zhigunov. We are in the midst of battle. It burns.. When burns in the mind it is a blessing when burns in the throat, the tonsils are infected. Half an inch left, maybe less, and it would hit the artery. And what, I'd fallen asleep? Like a baby. Like a boy. Like a boy. Stupid boy. - Girl, You talk with your superior. - And I am right. What do you mean? You can figure it yourself. Need reinforcement... Go to the backup position! Quick!
