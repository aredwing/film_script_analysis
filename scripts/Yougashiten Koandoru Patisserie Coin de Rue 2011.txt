My name is Natsume Tell Umi that Natsume's here to see him. Julian Tomura's order. OK right away. Hey she's asking me something... But I cannot understand Japanese. Can you help her out? What can I do for you? Where is Umi please? Umi...'? Umi he works here. Are you a friend? Well were more than just friends... I'd say We're almost engaged. Back home everybody knows about us. He did work here but then he left VVhy...?? So you're his ex-girlfriend? I'm not his ex! Why isn't he here? Where is he? If you want to know ask him yourself. I don't know where he is now. But... You're so heartless! I bet that's why Umi didn't stay. You could just tell me where he is! He didn't want to be an apprentice. But this job isn't easy! You could have given him a chance! He's a slow starter. He could have stayed but he didn't. Tomura What's her problem? Beats me. I don't understand her Japanese. She has an accent. Why are you still here? I have nowhere to go. Why don't you go home? I can't go home without Umi. I guess you Wouldn't give me a job... Please! "Now hiring" But you were so upset with me! That was then this is now. You won't regret it. I'll work hard! For how long? Until I find Umi. How will you find him? I'll do whatever it takes. Even if you found him would that dreamer go back to his ex-girlfriend? I told you that I'm not his ex! We make a select number of top-quality affordable cakes. We don't just employ anyone! I have experience! My family runs a cake shop. I bake all the cakes we sell. Come here. What's going on? Sit down. You'd better go back to your hometown. Or you could get a job at some cafe. What do you mean? Go somewhere where your cakes are appreciated. It shouldnt be hard for you to get a job. We don't serve Christmas Sale cakes here. Finish that and go home. What's wrong with my cake? You work too slowly. The cream was runny. The syrup was uneven. This is so delicious... I Want to learn how to make your cakes. I won't be any trouble. Please let me work here. I'll do my best. "Dear Natsume Sorry I didn't tell you" "but this is goodbye." "I have a job at Coin de rue in Tokyo." "Thank you for everything." "I want to be better than you at cake baking." "I want to see how far I can go." "Take care." "I know you'll soon find a man better than me." "Good luck." "Umi." Umi's not here Grandma. It looks like he quit. Grandma. I think I'll stay in Tokyo for a while. You're going to miss me aren't you? You wont? I know you will. I'll find Umi and come home in no time. Mr. Tomura it's time you wrote a new guidebook. Confectionery's popular right now. Some new shops have opened recently. The timings perfect Mr. Tomura. So early! You're an early bird! I can't sleep in like you. Right! Good morning. Good morning. Come out We're opening! Good morning welcome to Coin de rue. Welcome. Thank you. Thanks for waiting. Come again. Welcome. Welcome. I don't know her. She's the new help. Hello I'm Natsume I see. This place is always so crowded. I almost gave up waiting. Would you care for one of our new cakes? - I might as well. - Right away. I find her a little scary. Mrs. Yoshikawa is a valued regular. Don't upset her. Don't stare at her. Your Japanese sounds unusual. Is it my accent? Sometimes I don't understand you. But it has a cute rhythm. Thank you. That's Mariko there. Mariko! What? Well he told me your name so... If you've got something to say say it! Why is it on low heat? Anything wrong? No wonder you're taking forever. I think it works just the same. You'll never get better by compromising! Yes Chef... Hey you... Yes? Did you put the batter in these molds? Did you grease them properly? Uh...it depends what you mean by properly? None of these have been greased! I'm sorry. Anything that you ruin you have to eat! You've got yourself a week's supply of food! The first week is the toughest. I'm off now. See you tomorrow! It reads Kanreki That's a special anniversary to celebrate 60th birthday in Japan I use our original idea from Japanese culture... So what if you can speak English... Pay attention or I'll fire you! Framboise Fraise... Does it mean cherry...? Or strawberry? Framboise Orange... - Not bad. Sieve it. - Yes ma'am! If you do it enough it will become habitual. Right... The shops will prepare samples of their cakes for you. We'll schedule photo sessions. The shops will supply captions to accompany the cake photos. Do you think We'll have enough time? Yes. By the way the photos of the shops are so small... I'm ready. Oh no! I overslept! What are you saying? Today's a holiday. Why are you here then? Bookkeeping. The final quarter's coming to an end. Here! You earned this. Are you sure? Don't use it up too quickly. So much money! Amazing! Is this the first time you've been paid? I was working in Dad's cake shop. I never got paid because I was just helping him... Thank you very much. Once you improve I'll pay you more. I thought I was doing fine... You give me a headache. Pour me a coffee will you? OK. How about today? Any plans? I'll go and look for Umi. That's all I've got except for work. I don't know him. Thanks. What kind of cake is it? It has cassis in it. It looks delicious. Would you like one? Yes please. "Violet with white chocolate pured cassis bavarois" Something is not right. What am I doing wrong? Do you approve of my new cakes? Nice to see you. Still teaching part time? Yes I am. You writing a review on us? Aren't you sick of teaching and writing? There's a restaurant owner who wants to see you. The man who discovered you in Paris and took you to New York. He's in Tokyo? Yes. You should see him. Chef. Oh ouch... I get a headache just hearing your voice. How come? What's that serious face? Did you decide to go home? Would you mind trying this? I knew it was you! You're the thief. You'll pay for the ingredients out of your wage. What do you expect? That's our supplies! On the table. Yes. The mousse isn't right. It's overwhipped so it separated. The base is overcooked... Oh really? It has an aftertaste because you beat it too much. Here you are. Thank you. What are all these instruments? They're Julian's He plays in the park on his days off. That's great. I Want to hear him play. Go ahead. He'd like that. How did you meet Julian? It was opposite to your situation. I was an apprentice to a chef in Paris. When he opened a shop in New York he took me with him. And there was Julian. He was a character. Half musician half patissier! a shop in Tokyo. And he followed me. He was lucky that he was able to find you. Because he Wasn't distracted. How about you? Would you choose a man or work? If you can't be on your own you won't make it. It takes a lot of experience for you to be a good patissier You'll understand someday. Oh it's that man! You mean Tomura? He is a legendary patisserie I mean he used to be. Now he's a critic. He wrote that guidebook that you carry around. Was he a legend? He was the top patissier 'IO years ago. Oh my God! He won many international competitions. Incredible! Wow... Why isn't he a patissier now? Well... I don't know. Thank you for coming to see me. Tomura it's been a long time. Good. I heard you coming today so I was expecting to see you. Yeah. Someone told me you are looking for me. So here we are. You look very well. I was worried about you since the accident. How long has it been? It has been eight years. I may look OK... but I am not. You know actually... I came here to tell you I have no intention to return to the kitchen. I am sorry. So what I heard about you is true? You never change... and neither do I. That'll do. Really? Back to work! Yes madam I'm back. Hello there! I'm back. Mariko let me do that. I watched you do it. I can do it. No! Don't come near me. You could give me a chance... Tight bottoms. What? How dare you talk back when you know nothing! You're so obnoxious! You piss me off. Don't you speak to me like that! What was that for? You bully. That's why Umi left! You put down anyone who's better than you! Are you crazy? I have better things to do. He lasted here 2 days! I bet he's already left Lumiere You knew where he went! He's at Lumiere Now I know why that self-absorbed loser dumped you! You're unbelievable! He didn't dump me! What's wrong with her? She's insane. Hello. Natsume how are you? Bad thank you! I'm going to see Umi now! Are you upset? What will you do? I don't know. Don't say anything mean to him. Umi is entitled to do as he pleases. I wont be mean to him. I'll just make him come home. Mind your own business. Don't make trouble! Try to get along with people. I'm not making trouble! Listen carefully. You don't have to come back. Find somewhere that you belong. You don't understand Grandma! Oh that girl! Natsume? Umi have you been OK? What's with the uniform? I work at Coin de rue. What? How come? What do you mean? It's obvious. It is not. I'm here to take you back home. Were going back to Kagoshima Why should I? I'm not going. Your parents are worried! This is my life. It's nothing to do with my parents. When will you come home? When I'm good enough to have my own patisserie That's after I study abroad... Is that it? You're incapable of carrying that off! Stop dreaming! Come home with me! I wont know if I can do it unless I try. I'm telling you... it's impossible. There's absolutely no way... Why are you laughing? You're always so sure about what I can't do. - I've always hated that! - Sorry. It's just... I understand you better than anybody. I want to save you from obvious failure. Who says I will fail? Let's go home and help Grandma with the cake shop. That's better... Umi. Is everything OK? Who is she? I work under her but We're the same age... And... Well she's my girlfriend. Your girlfriend? What's that look? You and I broke up. You got my letter. I read every word in your letter. It didn't say anything about breaking up! I wrote "This is goodbye." it's clear what I meant! You asked me to marry you! That doesn't count! That was at kindergarten! We made a promise! You're making no sense. No you're not making sense. I told you we were finished! We haven't broken up! - We have! - No way! Were over! Oh boy... Natsume are you drunk? No I'm not! Chef I made up my mind. About what? I chose work! Sorry I left early today. Ah... That hurt! Umi and I broke up. At first I Wanted to go home. But I thought about my life here. All that happened since I came. Maybe this is the only place I can come back to. My life can only begin from here. Oh you've drunk yourself silly. Did you argue with Mariko again? That's because... I'm sorry. Chef. I promise to do my best. Please don't kick me out. Alright. First you owe Mariko an apology. We all help each other out. One day you'll appreciate her. Mariko. I'm so sorry. No silly! You have to say it to her face. Chef. I'll become the best patisserie in Japan! What? About yesterday... I'm sorry. I smell alcohol. I cant Do you have a hangover? Unbelievable! I don't! Nobody comes into this kitchen with a hangover! I don't have a hangover! Chef should tell you off! I don't have a hangover. Mrs. Yoshikawa there is a cake I'd like you to try. I'll have that then. Natsume one cassis au Homage. Yes Chef. It's started pouring. This isn't a cake you made? It's new on the menu. It's on the house. Here you are. It's not as good as the other cakes. Work harder so you don't ruin the shop's reputation. Yes ma'am. I'm sorry. We tried. Natsume one cassis au Homage. Uhm...again? It's the legend. Why is he here? He's a customer! He'll be the same as Mrs. Yoshikawa! Shut up and get the cake! The girl's been working on this. How many points do I get? Zero. What? Zero points. Zero? Why don't I get points? Give me a reason! Don't leave the kitchen. I made you a cake so you owe me an explanation! I owe you..? No patissier ever said anything so arrogant. You should quit! You're a disgrace to serious apprentices. I take it back! What about you then? All you do is criticize other people's cakes! Does that make you feel good? You might be called a legend but you're a quitter! Why did you quit? Because... I lost a reason to continue. Daddy. Oh ouch. Hey it hurts Yumi. Will you show me how to make a cake? When you come to the shop. Yumi put your shoes on. We have to go. It's your turn OK? I have to go see the accountant in the afternoon. Yumi Daddy will pick you up today. Yeah! You can show me how to make a cake! Uh-huh. Lucky you! See you Daddy! Natsume you made it. Julian looks particularly cool today. When you're doing what you love it shows. I love making cakes too though... Mr. Tomura told me to quit. I bet you said something to provoke him! I suppose you know why he quit being a chef... Pretty much. He had a family. A beautiful wife and a cute daughter. Yumi put your shoes on. We have to go. It's your turn OK? I have to go see the accountant this afternoon. Let me get some sleep... Daddy will pick you up today. Yeah! You can show me how to make a cake. Let's do it together. That's correct. I will make cream. A client said he's short of cakes... But he wants them by 5pm. That's not enough time... - Where? - Akasaka. Guys let's get busy. Yes sir. - How many tarte crusts are there? -10. I'll reconfirm the order but it's their mistake... No excuses. Get a truck ready. OK We'll make it. OK Sure Where is her mother? Where are the berries? We'll make it for sure. Let's go! All set. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Yumi. Yumi. Yumi. I'm right here! Yumi. Where are you Yumi? Yumi. Come back right here! Yumi. Yumi. Yumi. Why... Why does he have such a big reputation? Because his cakes made everybody happy. He could put a smile on anybody's face. Thanks for waiting. Here's your order. See you later! I want it now! Hello. Is the girl here? It's her day off. Oh. See you! It's settled then. We'll serve our best desserts and make your banquet a success. I'm sorry. I'm so annoyed with myself. It took me months to close that deal. It was to be our breakthrough. You pushed yourself too hard Yoriko. Nobody will remember us if we closed for 2 months. Are you closing the shop? The cast wont be removed for at least 2 months. Maybe Julian and I can manage... And me! That wont do. I'll let them know we can't do the banquet. Call the venders about the inventory. Make sure you deal with the food in the fridge too... Throw out any leftovers. You could hire a chef... If the cakes changed our regulars would stop coming. I'll get better and start again. But we have to call it quits now. I'm sorry. Don't stress yourself you have to rest. Then you can work on rehabilitating! I'm taking this back too. Thank you. "We'll be back Coin de rue" it's closed. That's odd... Let's go home. Let's go then. Can I help you? Sorry to surprise you. Are you Mariko Sato? Yes. Here's my business card. Sorry to bother you on your day off. I'm Yokoi I have a restaurant in Ebisu. Hello. I wanted to meet you after hearing so much about you. Natsume Yes? Here. What is this? Deliver this. You want me to do it? It's our last order. I guess. Hi. Natsume isn't it? Yes. Oh hello... Come on in. Oh that's right. I've heard so much about you I forgot you don't know me. Pardon me. I am Yoshikawa nice to meet you. You've been so kind to my wife. No she's been good to us. Isn't Mrs. Yoshikawa here? She became ill a while ago. She's having an operation next week. An operation? Unfortunately she won't be able to visit your shop like she used to. The doctor told her not to eat cakes but she sneaked out to your shop. That was a surprise! Oh... She hasn't had a good appetite. She became weak because she Wouldn't eat. I asked her if there was anything she'd eat. She said that she wanted one of your cakes. Then she'd agree to eat other food! So I called your shop and arranged a special delivery. I really appreciate you coming. She'll be fine now. Can I see Mrs. Yoshikawa? It's best if you didn't see her. She used to be a stage actress. She has way too much pride. I'm sure she said unkind things to you too. I'm afraid she didn't mellow with age! But she's actually a very kind person. I hope you can see that. I'll wait here. Tell me how she liked it. Thank you. Were you awake? I bought this from your cake shop. It's so delicious. Now I'll be fine. Can you imagine? When did that girl become so good at making cakes? This cake is very good. See how spacious it is? What do you think? It's very nice. Go ahead. Excuse me. Hello. Mariko. Oh it's you. What? I don't know... isn't there anything we can do? About Coin de rue... What can we do? Chef decided to close. I have to go now. What do you want? Mr. Tomura. Can you please be Coin de rue's chef? I'll assist. I'll do whatever I can to help. I cant I Want to save the shop. I need your help please! Only you can do it. Impossible. You won't know until you try! Stop annoying me. I'll do anything. I don't get much pay ... But you can have that too! Don't run from everything! Go back to Kagoshima! I can't! I won't I wont run. I was told... Your cakes make people happy. Stop writing guidebooks! Stop teaching! You have to start making your cakes again! I'm not... I'm not good enough. I can't do this alone. Please. Show me how to make cakes. Please! Daddy. Oh ouch. Will you show me how to make a cake? When you come to the shop. Yumi put your shoes on. We have to go. It's your turn OK? I have to go see the accountant in the afternoon. Yumi Daddy will pick you up today. Yeah! You can show me how to make a cake! Uh-huh. Lucky you! See you Daddy! Yumi. Sorry I couldn't keep my word. It's incomprehensible... Good evening. Hi I'm here to start preparing for the banquet. Chef. Thanks for coming. We can eat your cakes again... I'm counting on you. This is the list of banquet guests. There's a child on the list... That makes it tricky. It's not baked enough. It's floury. Let's try again. OK. What will you do after this? I don't know. Going back home? I don't know. How about you? I don't know either... Where's the Chef? She's still in hospital. Oh... What's up? I just dropped by because I saw the lights on. Bye. Wait! We're... preparing for the banquet. If you don't mind... Would you help out? Mariko. You still here? Well I live here. What's with the uniform? I'm helping with the banquet. What you? We have Mr. Tomura now. Mariko. If you felt like it... What do you want? Go. You'll catch a cold. I didn't want to come! Why are you here then? Why did you come to the shop last night? Were completely overworked! There's no time for your mind games! Wait a minute! Things began going wrong when you came! So stay away! That's unrelated! It's you who left! So who are you to talk? You will not pull off the banquet! It will be a phenomenal success! I hate the way you're so full of yourself! And I hate the way you're so spiteful! I've had enough! Oh you're too much! I'm gone! What did she come for? Well? Roll pastry for vol-au-vent. Why's she pissed? Thank you Tomura Nice to see you again. You're looking fine. Good to see you. I got your phone so are you going to say 'yes' to my offer? Sorry about that. I have a favor to ask. A favor? Anyway let's sit down and discuss it.But I'm pleased Good. Good Yumi. Your daddy wants to see your smile again. The French are not big on end-of-year celebrations. As soon as Christmas is over florists start selling mistletoe. That's what marks the year-end in France. This dish is ready. Yes. Give me the next one. OK. Are the dishes ready? Yes you may serve them now. Mr. Tomura. I have a question. Do I look like your daughter? No. Well why do you care about me then? I don't. it's just that We're from the same town. I haven't been back in a while and then I heard your accent. I thought I reminded you of your girl. No! She was loved by everybody. Get a move on. They' re ready. Take this dish out. Mr. Tomura. I'm getting nervous. Look at them. They're just the opening act. Guess who the stars are tonight. We'll put smiles on the guests at the end. Yes Chef. Natsume Leave Japan when you're done here. A New York academy has accepted you. Learn the trade from scratch. But it's so sudden... Both Yoriko and I studied there. What do you think? Dessert will be a little earlier. No problem. It's beautiful ...! I've never expected to eat 'Galette des rois' in Japan. Tonight we will serve 'Galette des rois' Only one piece of them contains a doll called feve and whoever gets the doll will have good luck for one year. From my heart I hope this cake will bring smiles to all of you not just one year. It's a miracle! Lucky you darling. I envy you. I still have the one I got when I was a kid. Mr. Tomura. Later. Can I ask you a favor? If you agreed I'll go to France America or anywhere in the world. Chef? Suit yourself. I will. It's not even. They are going on the shelf. Let me show you. Stir it... In the same direction. Yes. For four times. Yes. It's so delicious. It's me ... Tomura. Is Maki home? Well... How have you been? What brought you here? Here... I Want you to have this. It's delicious. I'm back at work. I'm making cakes. I Want you to eat one before anybody.
