I mean, these kids are just little bastards. These aren't, like, nice kids. And the problem is... I'm gonna throw it out there... 'Cause they're African-American. Nobody wants to say it because nobody wants to take action. 'Cause you got young black kids... They're misbehaving. They're riding on the sidewalks all up and down Pratt Street. Fifteen, 20, 30. Vroom, vroom. Everywhere. And we don't do anything about it. You gotta do something. You gotta do something. I don't care if they get hurt. Frankly, I don't care if one of them dies. Here, done. Oh, he... He on the bike. Right, I know. Hey, yo. Keep watchin' out right there, yo. - I do the same thing. I hate when I do that. - Yeah, I keep doin' it. Like I get... Fuck, yeah. She be chokin' up, like... Come on! Hop in! Hop in, 'cause they... They call 'em the 12 O'Clock Boys... because they drop the bike straight back. Like the hands on the clock. If you get to 12 o'clock, you the shit. You know you in the pack. That's when you can really shine. It's a dangerous and illegal Baltimore tradition... dirt bikes on city streets. Weaving through traffic, 20 people riding through Baltimore city... ...YouTube sensations post their renegade riding online. Police have a no-chase policy to prevent accidents, outraged at the recklessness... - A 6-year-old boy is in the hospital... ...claims to show city cops chasing dirt bikers. ...on the street, but defend their right... The dirt bikers are so worried about being nabbed by the police, so they're taking even more chances. We're not out there trying to terrorize anybody. 'Bout to go get some gas for the bike. Pullin' out. See the police down there, probably waitin' for me. Shut up! The boy comin' up with the dirt bike. He comin' up wheelie'n'. Hittin' it down. Goin' straight. He smacked the police car. Next thing you know, got his bike. Hell. He didn't even have no papers either. Right. Ain't had no papers on his bike. Papers. Now, how did you run into a police car when you got brakes? I know. People just be geekin' these days. Maybe that's it now, sucker. I'll still go on. Some people fall and hop off their bike and takin' an out. But if I fall, I'm gonna still hop back on my bike. No matter if I fall and break my thumb... anything. I'm hoppin' back on this bike. Sunday, we ride with the pack... wheelies gang. I don't even care. I'm ridin' down there. Have you ever done it before? No. It's our tradition, our culture. This is what we do. Can't nobody take it from us. This is our release. Baltimore City, Sunday! Swept through the crowd, so fuck the police. Any of y'all gonna try to stop us. This is our shit! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! I definitely don't wanna ride down this bitch with this bike on the truck... with the police down here. Another police right there. Just sit back, look casual. I'm tryin'. Go, go! Hurry up! Hurry up! You may wanna... Good. I'm tellin' you what's goin' on. You keep tellin' me some other shit. I'm tellin' you what's what. We just intercepted my man. His bike broke down at the park. Police ran right up on him. Scony pulled in front of him to tow him. He grabbed right on to the back of the grab bar, and they got outta there. I got his bike in the back of the truck now. And a fuckin' bird is on us, watchin' us now. I don't ride on the street no more like that, so I play the supportive role. Police must be down here chasin' him. See the police over there? Yeah. Coverin', watchin' them at the gas station? Yeah. Watch it. Watch it, guys. See that shit? That's Shahib he chasin', man. He chasin' Shahib 'cause he got a girl. Gettin' it. Gettin' it. Gettin' it. Gettin' it! Gettin' it! Get it! Get it! Now you see how... I'm tryin' to school these young niggas on the back. I tell 'em, "You gotta be relaxed. " If you panic, that would have been his ass. He'd have fell. The police would have laughed at him, and left while he was all on the ground all fucked up. All right, I'm on my way up there, 'cause I'm at your house now... with these niggas' bike on the back of the truck... I'm on my way up there. Right. I know. The chopper keep following me now. I'm gonna get this bike the fuck off my fuckin' truck. Sittin' ducks right now. Kai, many of you who drive on city streets have seen these dirt bikes before, but it is difficult for police to enforce the law. ...see cops chasing dirt bikes, but police say their policy is not to chase. Baltimore police are not allowed to chase dirt-bike riders because it's too dangerous. Instead they use police helicopters to track the bikers. They fuck my kids. Well, let's fuck them. So we... She ain't leavin' off this block, bitch. It's gonna be a bad fuss with this motherfucker, 'cause they my motherfuckin' kids. She out of order, gonna fuckin' try to run the kid off... Bitch gonna run her mouth. She don't know who in the car. - Bitch, you don't know where you at! - Here we go. Come on and do that, Mom! This bitch right here is not leavin'. I'm tellin' her, don't hit the girl's head. Just mark the face, bitch. Prepare your stuff! You ain't leavin'. They callin' the po po. They can call the C.-fuckin'-I.A.! Get out of the way. I'm callin' the police. They're callin' her bluff. It ain't really safe in Baltimore. Then kind of it is and kind of is not. 'Cause every, like, every other night, you gonna be hearin' about, oh, somebody tell and got shot. Or somebody got stabbed or... It's always somethin'. I like Baltimore because we don't get no floods. We don't get no hurricanes... and none of that like all them other states. That's why I like Baltimore. I don't wanna be in the front or in the middle of the pack. I'd rather be in the back or on the sidewalk. 'Cause you... You're stuck in the middle and the police come, you gonna get hit off your bike, or you gonna fall and they gonna run you over. I got a lot of money. In my pocket. Look! And money! Money! And money. Money! Money. Money. Money. Pug my brother. Oh, please. Yep. He's my brother. And I already know what you all gonna do. You all gonna videotape him too small, too big. Every time I open my door, he gone. I have to call his phone five or six times a day. "Where you at? Where you at?" He everywhere where he don't have no business to be. He too little for that. Even though he up there in age a little bit. But he's too small in size. Somebody could have snatched him up. They crazy out here. They crazy. But it's about to seriously be about me. It's about to be my show. My reality show. No. Coco's Show. Coco and the Kids. No. It's about there be a Baltimore reality show. Oh, really? I was a exotic dancer... before I got pregnant with Pug. His father was so proud to have his first son, he went out and bought Pug a pit bull. Pug been lovin' pit bulls ever since. Pug in the tub. He's tryin' to figure out, "What do I wanna do in life? Who am I? What do I wanna be?" That's what those little eyes are sayin'. He's not... Where are you? Well, get up here then. You shouldn't even be down there. You always somewhere. Okay, I see you now. Why you always leavin'? Shut the door. You hardheaded. You always leavin'. Get over here. Oh, you about to get slapped. Get over here. You be 13 tomorrow. Act your age, please. I do. Act your age. You don't have no business goin' nowhere. When I tell you to stay somewhere, that's where you supposed to stay at. Do you know you can get locked up for certain things? You need to really get yourself together and stop worrying about bikes. Bikes is not everything. You have to have a education to be able to ride a bike. Growin' up in the city, you will see it all. You will learn the right way to do all the wrong shit in Baltimore City. I have a Ph. D. in it. If you walk outside on the corner, you see motherfuckers hustlin', shootin', sellin' drugs, killin', sellin' pussy. One of the first things you see that you actually wanna do is ride a dirt bike. It's one of the first things you see that's positive, sittin' on a step with your buddies, sayin', "In a couple more years, I'm gonna have that dirt bike. I'm gonna be wheelie'n' like this nigga. I'm gonna be doin' it. I'm gonna be wallin' out. I'm gonna be the next 12 O'Clock Boy. " Pug just got on a bike, knew what to do. He could tell you every bike, and how to work it and all of that. He's an interesting person. Like, you know, some of the things that you ask him about an animal, he can just come out and tell you, like... He can tell me stuff about an animal that I can never imagine to even know about. I don't know where it came from. It's like he had a little gift from birth. Fluff-Fluff. That one named. Look at you. You about to just make up something. No, the black one. You remember when you said that name was... Sing. You're our little puppy Baby, baby Pup, pup, pup Baby. Yes, you're our puppy babe. You a crybaby. When I met his father, I thought that we was gonna be together for a while. But he was back and forth, in and out of jail. After I had my fourth child by him, I just got tired of it, and I just let it go. When I first had Pug, Tibba was so happy to be a big brother. Tibba was like the man of the house. He was like the father that my children didn't even have. Tibba was the only one that Pug would really listen to. A 125, that's a big bike. That's a big, big bike. If you can handle them bikes, you should be on 'em, you know. He don't wanna take his time on learnin'. If you keep it that fast, you gonna bust your motherfuckin' head, basically. You gonna hurt yourself on the bike. Them bikes is dangerous. That's all I was sayin' though. Yeah. I just want him takin' his time. Take his time. The dirt-bike pack formed... And I just happened to be the head. My people already know me. Wayne. Wheelie Wayne. Dirt-Bike Wayne. The Greatest. Whatever you wanna call me. There's no way around us two. Bike life... we started that type thing. They say anything about bikes in this city, they gonna mention me. We took the dirt-bike thing from just lookin' at it as a bike. We took it to a whole nother level. We had bikes, and we were just filmin' ourself, playing with the camera. And then one day I just jumped up and was like... "We gonna make us a group. We gonna make a tape. " You know me, Weedy, original 12 O'Clock Boy. Twelve at everything. But it's control and balance is what make it a 12 O'Clock Boy. Rock it again! Rock it again! Oh, shit! I can do it. Just lift it up. This isn't high school. He shouldn't have told me. He shouldn't have told me. Dirt-bike niggas, we don't wear no helmet. Once they got it on tape, you can sit in the house and just watch it and rewind... and rewind and keep rewindin' and playin' and watchin' it. You had to have a copy. We got kids who were lovin' us. We got big muthas who was lovin' us. Everybody was just tryin' to buy a copy of it. When you look at that footage, it's gonna be... between eight and 15 rides. When you come out now, you see what? Fifty, 100 rides. This is what we do. That's what we do. Train on target. Your boy, Gucci, man, It's what we do. We can take my bike, get the fuck away. I'm recording him, he recording me. This is my nigga. We plan to work tonight. Not one of these niggas down here will let me get a ride. I'm tryin' to be on YouTube. - Charge up, nigga - Charged up I just throw 'em back Reelin' with ya, rollin' on We, yes, them triple stacks And that was just like... It's like a blessin', for real. When YouTube first came out, it just killed the game. It just spread like wildfire. Sober niggas have no idea how it feelin' Yeah We charged up, nigga On your phone in school, you supposed to be doin' some fuckin' homework. You lookin' at your favorite Wildout Boy. I was the most popular as far as hits in YouTube. When we first put my skit on the air, I got more hits than anything. It was, like, Japan, New Zealand, Miami, Barbados... We got people hittin' our page. People who ain't even know that Baltimore ever existed... is watchin' us across the world right now. It's dangerous. It's fun. It's exciting. And it's powerful. You don't know how it was when I was ridin' Sunday with the pack. I seen you, dude. You lyin'! Nigga be ridin'. I can see it... You lyin'! You ain't... See, he lyin'! Tell him I did. I keep up with the pack. Yeah. All right, then, he need to mind his business. He don't know what I did under my... in my engine... to ride with the pack. You right. You right. You right. - Stop your talkin' about the dirt bike, please. - All right. I do not want to keep hearin' about the dirt bike. Huh? I might have a black one. 'Cause I got on mismatched shoes. Why is that? I forgot. I just hurried up and put 'em on. Big face and he is small I like 'em all I don't really care As long as he's a freak, freak, freaky Freak, freak, freaky He tough Back to business. Stop! I'm about to beat your little "B." Little big head, fat head, little watermelon head. Knucklehead. Sy, get off. Sy, no. Sy, get off him. No, I know. I know. Yo, is we cool or what? All right, we cool. All right then. Is we cool or not cool? Cool. All right. Just makin' sure, shorty. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom! Boom, boom! This is how we do, man, all day. Fuck the police. Yeah. And he be tryin' to get girlfriends by swingin' his arm on his four-way. Yes! Shut up! Do you think that works? No! Last time, it was like he was gettin' beat up 'cause... Everybody see he can't fight. Yeah, he can't. That's what everybody say. See, he was runnin' 'cause he actin' like the helicopter lookin' for him, so girls can think, "Ooh, he's so bad. " You all right? You know why you all right. Look like he asleep. I lost my son. My oldest son. From an asthma attack. Shit. I don't know if he all right or not. I thought... So I'm tryin' to figure out why I ain't storm out the door. Because you not dead. Huh? I said, "'Cause you not dead. " What you sayin'? Why you sayin'... It's not the time! Stop! Stop! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! You go on! Get out there! Keep them the fuck off! Get off of me! Get off of me! Pug, wake up! I just wanna get away. You know? I don't wanna go! Sunday, early in the mornin', I look out the window and just look for that sun. If I see that sun, I know it's gonna be a good day. When I get downstairs and walk in that backroom and see that bike, it's just like you my girlfriend, like I'm talkin' to her, like, "Yeah, we gonna tear the streets up today. " Once I start that bike up, it's like a nervous feeling. My leg starts to shake. It's just a feelin', like, "What could go wrong this day? This... This could be my last time on the bike. " Maybe police chasin'. You maybe get hurt. I think about everything. I think about everything in the mornin'. But once I pull off, all that feeling just goes out the window. And it's just me, the world, the bike and the streets. I've been bikin' all my life. So I know kids, like, every time you see 'em, they know you. They know exactly your name and all that. They'll never forget you, 'cause I never forgot a person, never. Still know that guy to this day. I was young, plain to see. I was, like, seven or eight years old, rolling round the block. Ever since then, I always wanted a bike. I just had to wait till I get older. Turned about 14. Got my first little four-wheeler. I used to ride around here and learn how to wheelie. One time, I heard the pack. I was in the house. I heard it. And I knew it was them. I just ran out back, tryin' to get my bike. Went. That was my first time tryin' to find the pack. I was right behind 'em, but I never caught up with 'em. I just had to wait till I get older. When I turned 18, that's when I had the opportunity to ride with 'em. The first time was so fun. It was so fun. It was just, like, the funnest day of my life. And then I went home and just fell asleep, and that day was the best. And I got... I just couldn't wait till another Sunday, that's all. I just couldn't wait. Another Sunday. I just wanted to ride again. Come on, slow. Come on, slow! Yeah, I ride! You fightin'. What's that? You want a run on the bikey? Ride on the bikey! What alley? The alley. That one? There go the bikes. Here we go. Lord, see right here. Oh, man, see right here. Hey! Hey, man! Yo, we gonna come out! I'm gonna come out too! Hey! Come here! Wait! - They're free. They get on that bike, they feel powerful. Whatever's goin' on in their life, it's all gone. You can escape... and ride. Uh, I been on this earth for a decade... and a couple years. So what that makes me... I'm a grown-ass man. Niggas would beef. They would fight, stab and kill each other. East and West. When Sundays came, it was time to ride. All of that shit was nothin'. We ride as one Baltimore pack. One fuckin' flock. Yeah, basically, 'cause that gang stuff is, like, gettin' real high-end. Even though they against each other, they still have love for us, for the whole sport. When you ride a bike, for some reason, it seem like it make you neutral. "K." "K" looking all crazy riding ahead. Man's clutch is goin' up. That be like... His stomach's so big, he look pregnant. I might ride down with the pack... for the first time. But I wasn't tryin' to ride with 'em yet, 'cause I think they gonna leave me on this. I need a better bike. They got a gut side to show off. But I ain't gonna "show" show off. I'm gonna just... just pop my little clutch, yeah. Just take it up for a little bit. And since they are too dangerous to chase, Alex DeMetrick reports police are finding new ways to stop them. Adopting a strategy of watch, wait and track with surveillance cameras... and the department's Foxtrot helicopters, riders can literally be followed home, often without ever noticing they're being watched. This new system, I can look right down, put the crosshairs on 'em, and I can tell 'em quickly what alley he's in. Officers will also be able to use thermal imaging... and zoom in on suspects from miles away. Animal, whenever you want it. Whose gonna ride past? Give each other five. Any nigga want it, they can come get it. Hit me up on Facebook. However you want it. 12 O'Clock Wheelie Boyz, man. We out. No, it ain't that. It ain't that. We're biker boys. It ain't. Yo, everybody got the name. For real. They just call us the 12 O'Clock Boys. My mother know. I know Wheelie Boy. Yo, the boys. The boys! The boys, boys. 2920 Erdman. The big house that's sittin' on top of the hill. Who's your brother? Which one? Um, heavyset. Tall. Yeah. What's his name? He died. He's on the back of my shirt. Oh, yeah, you... Oh, yeah. Okay, I remember that. You all was down there today, weren't you all? No. I know everybody. Well, how you know my big brother? It was a cookout I was at. How you know? How do I know your big brother? I just know him. - You just know him? - Yeah, I know him. 'Cause I'm good like that. Listen, though. I'm not gonna put your business out there, okay? All right? Which way they went? Which way they goin'? They drivin' up to that road. Up on that road? I think they're headin' on straight down. Tryin' to link back up with the flock. It's torture though. Right. They did that dumb shit. They tried to hit the block again. Where the police... main police station... Like, we was right there where they were. If he ready, they at Dunbar. At Dunbar? Yeah. They get this kick out of ridin' past the main police headquarters, right on the edge of the block where the strip clubs and the main police headquarters is. They get a kick of goin' down there and fuckin' with them. That's where they went at. And, uh, the pack got split up. The bikers come this way? They came this way, the pack? Yeah, yeah. Straight down. Which way? I got a flat right there, yo. Get that shit on tape. Bird on 'em. That guy is hard. Ooh, I'm glad. Where you at? All right. Go ahead. Hey, chill out. Chill out while there's coppers. You talkin', I was swallowin' my guts, not to say nothin'. You know, I was ready to blank. They been illegal, they probably stay illegal, but chasin' 'em is not gonna solve the problem. These resources could be goin' somewhere else. I mean, they firing firefighters and police. Fuck the police. Fire all the motherfuckers. Hire some more firefighters. They actually save lives. They harass you. They wanna treat you like you ain't shit, like you don't know shit. I work every fuckin' day. You ask anybody. I work six, seven days a week. And I make real good money. I pay these whores. I pay their fuckin' salary. So fuck all the dirty cops. I'm gonna say that till I die. What's up, man? What's up? What's goin' on? Nothin'. Take these little dudes... like, "I want some. " I mean, for real, I have fun watching 'em ride, so... I enjoy this shit. Wherever they build warehouses that's far from a highway, we take advantage of the situation and jump out there and ride. It's away from traffic and everything, so we're not endangering anybody... or breakin' any rules or anything like that. We just go back there and ride. Dirt-bike riders are dirt-bike riders. Period. These little niggas back here, they gonna always love dirt bikes. Pug is one of them little type of dudes where he gonna be a monster. Another Chino, another Greatest One. That's what people don't realize. They, like, "Oh, he's so small. " Don't matter your size. It matter your skill. Put Anne in. Put Anne in. How much you gonna sell it to me for? Stack for what? That. I don't want that. I don't want that. I want that. That's my wife. That your wife there? Yeah. You guys all set? Yeah. Back it up a little bit. When I got hit... Stop, yo! When I got hit, I hit a tree and got knocked unconscious. I broke my collarbone. I fractured all of my face. And my teeth came out. I like... I like the rush of it. It's something you love, you're gonna do it anyway. In two weeks, I'll be back out. Police on the lookout... for a dangerous dirt-bike rider... who nearly killed six-year-old Corey Adams. Witnesses say he's in his 20s, with braids. The dirt-bike driver popped a wheelie, lost control of his bike... and slammed into the six-year-old. The driver got off his bike, shook the unconscious child, then drove away. And that six-year-old boy is in serious condition tonight. His family tells us he was hit so hard his teeth were knocked out. He did undergo surgery earlier today. Hey Is that my brother's keeper? Yes, I am, I am I ride for you, nigga I die for you, nigga And if I'm caught, I do that time for you, nigga I ride, ride, ride for you 'Cause you my dog I know you'd do the same for me too 'Cause I'm your dog You niggas know what it is. All you bitch-ass niggas. Get that, get that. That's what we do right over here. Come here, bitch. Get that. Fucked-up goddamn bitch. I'm not broke yet. How you doin'? What's your name? Coco. Coco? My name is Cowboy. How old am I? You don't suppose to ask a female how old they are. Why? But, no, I'm not 27, but thanks for the compliment. I'm 30. I'll be 37. You look good. Thank you. How old are you? You 40? Yeah, I can tell. Soul ] Hey! That's my song. That's that Sade. Sometimes I need a breather. Hey. How many tons of love inside Girl, you can rape me. I'm over age, y'all. I can't say When I was led to you I knew you were the one for me... Honestly, I can't even speak on the summer. I just live day by day. I can't even speak on the future... or what's gonna happen because... people die within a blink of an eye. So I live the day how it go. Pug got suspended from school because he was fightin'. This, like, the fourth time that he done been suspended this year. Like I say, I know he goin' through stuff... because his brother passed away and all that, and I'm goin' through stuff too. But he thinks it's just all about him and these bikes, and it's not. I'm not havin' it. I'm not losin' no more children. And I'm not havin' no more funerals... for nobody bein' hardheaded. See, all I gotta do is go to the police station and drop him off, and they'll keep him down there for 12 hours. He'll be hurt about that. See, I never had that problem out of Tibba. Tibba sat up there and listened to what I said. You know, Tibba wasn't a street runner. But this one right here, I don't know where he came from. He just wild. This is how you slap somebody. You spread your fingers out, right? Spread 'em out. Make sure they back. Let 'em feel all palm. Bom! Just slap 'em. They, "Whoa!" Leave a print on their face. Let us pray. O most precious Heavenly Father, we just thank and praise you, Lord. Gospel, Up-tempo ] This a, um, baby map turtle. They're chill. They be, like, on a branch or stick... just gettin' somethin' to eat. And this one. A baby alligator snapping turtle. And when these get big, these get up to 150 pounds. So y'all don't know where he might be at? He won't answer his phone for nobody. He been gone since 9:00 this morning, and it's 6:00 this evening. So he haven't ate nothin' or nothin'. This don't make sense because he didn't have no business leavin' the house. Don't you dare. Don't you dare. Go back... Get down! Get down and go back around back now. I can't even let that boy on the porch. I turn my back, he gone all the way across the street. You keep hanging with these dudes and stuff. I don't know them people.

That's what he gonna do. He gonna ride. He behind it. He behind it. You behind that? I'll see you tomorrow, all right? All right. All right. None of that dirt-bike shit ain't gonna get you nowhere in life, 'cause you damn sure ain't gonna have no education... or no high school diploma if you don't stay in school. And you surely won't have a job as a veterinarian. You could be a professional dirt-bike rider... and a veterinarian at the same time. I don't wanna be a veterinarian. I wanna be... No, you said you was gonna be one, and that's what the fuck you gonna be. - No, I wanna be a dog catcher. - Hell, no. But, see, I'm puttin' the whole body shield on him. What the matter you? I'm telling you, I'm getting him... That shit cost $200. I don't give a goddamn if it was $1,000... so your bones won't break. About time you do get in it, somebody else... God forbid. Something else gonna happen to somebody else. 'Cause shit is real out here, and them polices are not playin'. We'll put together and get the baby something. We may not meet Sunday, but we'll get something. Albert Lemon, C.E.O., Regional Security Protection Agency. Former Baltimore city police officer. How you doing? Everything good? Everything's good. - There you go. There you go. - Exactly. I believe, we lose at least... at least 10 to 15 lives every summer... in reference to dirt bikes. I want to get to the subject about Officer Lemon. It's kind of disturbing that he made the accusations that he did. You know what I'm sayin'? And I was right there. I seen him in his patrol car and what he did. I responded to a call to back up another officer. While en route to the call, there were several individuals riding dirt bikes. And the dirt bike begins to do doughnuts around us. Then the driver flips us the bird... and began traveling on Belvedere Avenue on the wrong side of the road, continued up the sidewalk. Then he bounced off the sidewalk... and crashed head-on into an oncoming vehicle. I then observed him fly in the air about 50 to 100 feet. A crowd began to come on the scene... and observe and start ranting and shouting. You know, "That Officer Lemon, he was chasing him. He was chasing him. He was chasing him. " It really hurt me a lot to see him get chased... and then get mauled down like that. And he didn't care. Like, Lemon didn't care. Marvin had just learned how to ride bikes. He jumps on the curb. I tell Marvin, "Don't try to outrun him," 'cause I know he can't ride that good. Lemon comes and jumps the curb, and he chased Marvin on the curb. Lemon bumped his back wheel, and he went into the back of that black sedan. He flew about 50... He was higher than the power lines. His body was like... like a doll. And when he hit the ground, he was gone. He was gone. He was done. I don't feel sorry for Lemon at all. At all. Like nothing. He brought it on hisself. The next day, in their rioting in the community, you know, spray-painting my name on vacant buildings, on people homes... "Kill Officer Lemon," "Officer Lemon is a murderer. " But if we can't chase, we can't chase. We don't want to risk the lives of innocent people by chasing them... unless they committed a violent act. But, at the same time, the act of them riding around, doing wheelies at high speed, is a violent act in itself. And I showed him how to ride. And... He used to be, like, in the streets. But when he got his bike, he started changing his life. His family was kind of happy for him. He wasn't doing something that was extra positive, but he wasn't on the corner as much, 'cause he had his bike. He was riding his bike all the time. He was young. He was young. He was about 20. Nickname was Giggles. And Lemon knew exactly who he was. This summer... I'm not gonna say it's my summer, but I'm gonna fuck this summer up. 2010... my summer was bullshit. 2011... my summer was bullshit. And 2012... this is gonna be the shit. Last year, I was Pug. This year, I'm Biker-Boy Pug. The thing about Pug, he's a real cool dude. I think he gonna grow up to be somethin'. It look good when you see a little guy, real small, wheelie'n' a bike. We look at it, like, yeah, that's good. Because he gettin' in training now. Imagine him when he get older, what he gonna be doin'. I ain't gonna talk, but y'all niggas wanna see this. - Lotta niggas wanna know about that little nigga Pug. - I'm trying to tell you. You can't just ride, call yourself a 12 O'Clock Boy and raise it up while a Wheelie Boy, and then stop. Some niggas do that shit. "Oh, my leg got hurt. " "Oh, I got fucked up on a dirt bike. " I feel you, but you should've been paying more attention... as you got fucked up. Only time I used to be scared is when I didn't really knew what I was doin'. Now I'm gonna fuck the police up. There can be two helicopters... the news and a police helicopter... and five police cars. I'm gonna burn their ass up on a 150. Fuck they talkin' about? Comin' through. Say there, bitch, you like that? Call me. Yeah. Watch. Go on, bitch! Shit. Just calm down! Loud Rap ] Make that bitch moan like Next Sunday, I'm straight out. Get off. Get off! Quit hoppin' on my bike. Yeah, beat him. Fuck off. Ouch! Beat him with that broom. Did you all blow the shit out? That ain't mine. We're about to get wasted. I need it for the pain medicine. You fall before you get nice. Don't you, Jamal? What? Fall before you get nice? Yeah. My shit was just like yours. They hit me though. They ain't hit you. Pug, why you didn't tell me you got chased by the five-0 today? I want to know what happened. He don't tell me the good stuff, 'cause I'm the aunt. Tell me what happened. That's good to hear. No, I just need to know that you safe. 'Cause you know I don't like you to be in no trouble. I worry. My nerves bad. Other guy in the back say, "Get up. I wanna chase you. Get up. " I thought they're not supposed to chase kids on dirt bikes. It's illegal for them to chase anybody on a dirt bike. I remember, years ago, a little girl got hit near the projects. They're not supposed to do that shit. It is illegal. Right. It's illegal to chase 'em on dirt bikes. Because it's dangerous for pedestrians. Like, you know what I'm sayin'? Hang on. Who that? Pug. You in trouble. I gotta go to court. They done sent me a letter for me to go to court... for you not goin' the fuck to school. And I been callin' to your phone. No, the fuck you haven't. You ain't go to school none in June but one time. Don't tell me, Pug. I got the letter. I called everybody at school. It's your ass that's the fuck I gotta go to court for. You worry about other shit. Your ass should've been goin' to school. Then the fuck I wouldn't have to be dealin' with this shit now. He punished. I'm done with this. I mean it. Let me finish cleanin' up the house and laundry. You sure? Yes. He punished. Don't ask me is I'm sure. I know I'm sure. Don't go nowhere, yo. I ain't gonna rip your bike. All right. What? What he say? He said he gonna take my shit? Where's he goin'? Said he's going around the block. Pug! Y'all say I know all these niggas. By next summer, we all gonna be there. Fuck next summer. I gotta tell you about one police car that got into it. That dumb ass sittin' on a curb. How you get caught? 'Cause it was the police car in front of him. But there was a task force. Look at his poor ass. That's my little nigga. They about to come out with this. Ain't that right? Ain't that right? You about to fuck the city up. You right. Ooh! Yo, Pug done get robbed. Yeah. First 250. Full stick. Pug, where your fuckin' dirt bike at? Where's your fuckin' dirt bike? Somebody stole it. Where they steal it? When I was ridin' in the park. You mean to tell me... You let somebody steal your fuckin' bike. How the fuck he steal it? I let him hold it. Didn't I tell you don't let nobody hold it? I should slap the shit out you... for letting somebody hold your motherfuckin' bike. Don't keep fuckin' taking me for a motherfuckin' joke. I'm sick of this shit. Clean this motherfuckin' yard up and get this shit the fuck up. All your fuckin' company about to go the fuck home. So when you were gonna tell me somebody stole the bike? I was gonna go get it back. Well, when you gonna go get it back? How you gonna go get it back? I'm gonna get it back. You don't appreciate shit, Pug. I don't have money like this. You punished. How are you gonna get it back? I'm gonna take it back. He's dead. Don't make me act like Coco. What you got? No. This is University Parkway, dummy. Yeah? So I should turn around? He so fucked. Bitch. Get in this right lane! Get in this right lane! Hey, old man. Can we cross? Can we get in? Can we cross, sir? Thank you. Thanks, bitch. Ugly ass. How the fuck I'm-a get a job, and they keep... Pet stores and all them CVS, all that shit, keep giving me their bullshit. "Oh, you have to be 16." "Oh, you have to be 15 and nine months. " Fuck that bullshit. You got a lot of vocabulary now. I know. Right? Where'd you learn all that language? Good vocabulary, ain't it? Where'd you learn all that language? School, nigga. School. There go the helicopters. Flock must be over there. Go, go, go. - Twelve, yo! Hey, yo! - Yo! Fuck them! Fuck them! Fuck the police! Yeah, fuck them! Fuck the police, yo! Fuck them! You got your whole life to see the bikes. No. Why not? Tomorrow or today not promised. You could die any minute. Right or left? Straight. He got killed runnin' from the police that day. Dropped him right off his dirt bike. Right there on North Avenue. Something wrong with his mind frame. I don't know what's wrong with it, but his mind frame is nothing like how Tibba's mind frame was. I'm doing everything that I'm supposed to do. I'm gettin' him bikes. I'm lettin' him wear the best clothing there is. He have all these animals and pets and everything... that he just left here with me to deal with. He's just roaming the streets, not listening, and I can't deal with it no more. So when I go to court, I might just let them keep him... or put him on a home monitor. 'Cause this got to stop. Because he gonna get me in a world of trouble. If I go to jail, they takin' all my kids. It's sad, but I'm-a get it straight though. Trust me on that one. I'm-a get his ass evaluated. That's what I'm-a do. Were you at Chesterfield? Yeah. I have a grandson that live up there. What's his name? He want me to call him Jo-Jo. - Did you pass? - I think so. You should know so. Come on, Pug. Talk about your grades. They... They good. They not excellent. They good though. They good enough to get you by? Yeah. Are you sure? Mm-hmm. Mmm. So what does your future hold for you? Probably being a veterinarian. That's wonderful. You like animals? Mm-hmm. That's good. Give me a smile on that. Look at that fox. Damn. He came from over there. That was crazy. But it takes a lot to keep one person straight. What they say? It takes a village to raise a child. It really does. She can raise Pug by herself, but she shouldn't have to. One person trying to raise a motherfucker like that? It's a lot. Every city has a Pug. Every hood has a Pug. This is what the ghetto produces... hostile environments, anger, stress, depression. You know, dealin' with all of this shit... on a day-to-day, on a regular basis, you gonna have a negative fuckin' outcome. It's a recipe. To jump on a dirt bike and leave all that shit behind... with first, second gear, third gear... All that shit don't mean nothin'. Yeah. We gonna ride, nigga. We gonna ride. Fuck who's sayin' we can't ride. I changed over the years though. Because back then, if that bitch would've slapped me on my face, I would've beat that bitch up. I know I would've. What was it today? Yeah. My principal wanna put me out anyway. She says if I get in trouble again... or if I touch any of her students... I'm gonna be walkin' out with silver bracelets. She don't like me. Why not? 'Cause I'm the shit. 'Cause you're the shit? Yeah. What makes you the shit? I don't think I'm the shit. My principal don't like me because... I don't know. She never did. One day, this little boy tried to lie and say I took his money, right? So we all go to the little... Me and Bootsy and the little boy. He say me and Bootsy, we rob and we takin' money with a gun. Bitch, how we bring a gun to school? So we tell our side of the story. She say, "I don't believe you anyway. You always in my office. " That's some fucked-up shit to tell somebody, ain't it? All right, Pug. Around about 2:00, 3:00, we go to the house. We make sure everybody upstairs or everybody asleep. And then, grab the bike. My man got the van for that. Put the bike in the van and be gone. Let me get a picture of my bitch. My new bitch. That sound about right. Closed-Captioned by
