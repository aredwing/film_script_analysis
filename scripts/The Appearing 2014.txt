There's no neutral ground. Never, never come up... Come on. - Ah! - Asshole. No. Ow! Easy, buddy. Would you relax? Come on. I don't like being out here. It creeps me out. No one asked you to come. - We're trespassing. - Do you hear this shit, baby? What are you afraid of anyways? Janet Hobbs came out here five years ago, went missing, never came back. Yeah well, Janet Hobbs was a nutjob. - She wasn't the only one. - I don't see what the big deal is anyways. - It's just an old house. - I think you're just scared. And I think you're gonna be finishing all by yourself tonight. You serious? The Granville place is haunted. - What are you guys talking about? - Martha May? Crazy chick from the '80s, possessed by a demon. S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A. It did all kinds of freaky shit to her. You are so full of shit. My mom went to high school with that lady. She had an affair with this guy from across town. She couldn't handle the guilt. It drove her crazy. - I heard she committed suicide out there. - That's a lie. Okay, then what really happened, wise-ass? The real question is what's the town hiding from us? I wanna see it. No! Forget about it! Are you out of your mind? I wanna see what's out there. Susie, no. We've grown up with these stories our whole life. - Aren't you curious what's out there? - That's just it, it's just stories. - There's nothing out there. - It's like... It's like a bad place, man. It's like... Very bad. - Susie! - She'll be dead by morning. Hello? This place is freakin' creepy. What the hell is this shit? Are you joking? I mean this is freakin' weird. - Who the hell would even live here? - Hey hey. - I mean... - Hey, hey, hey! We're finally alone now. You promised. That's too rough for me. It's too rough for me. Something doesn't feel right. Nathan? Nathan! Nathan?! Nathan? Nathan. Our new deputy from San Francisco? - Sheriff Hendricks, right? - Yeah, we spoke on the phone. I'm Michael Brodie, this is my wife Rachel. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. You too. Have any trouble finding us? Your town doesn't really appear on most maps. It's always hard to see what's right in front of your face. I'm... I'm just messin' with you. Not even on most maps. Listen, I... uh, I... I really appreciate what you're doing here. Oh yeah, glad to help, glad to help. It's not every day we get a big-city detective here. The truth is my deputy bailed town last minute, so I was bound to hire the first person that called. Most folks who come here are usually running from something. That or they got no place else to go. I'm not running from anything. We're just looking for something new. Ain't we all? Ain't we all? Anyway, winter months are usually pretty quiet here. Population just under a thousand. We're just simple folk really, just... It's the way I like to keep it. All right. It's really amazing. Ugh. All right, this is the place. There you go. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Oh, it's beautiful. Yeah, this is one of our summer rentals. Uh, the family doesn't come up till June so you guys are welcome to use it until you find a place. Okay, thank you. Uniform, gun, badge. All right, I guess I'll leave you guys alone. - Let you get settled in. - Thank you. - Thanks. - You're welcome, welcome. Um, I'll pick you up in the morning? - Yeah. - Welcome to Glenwood Bay. - Well, here we go. - Here we go. - I made us breakfast. - Yeah. This is Mike. Uh-huh. What do you normally do? Really? No, okay, I'll be there. I'll leave right now. What was that about? It was Hendricks. First day on the job, already a missing person. I thought maybe we could have breakfast together. I'm sorry, Rach, you know there's a missing person. I'm already late. Mmmm. Have a good day. Hello? Hello. Are you okay? My husband and I live in the house over there. I shouldn't be here. My sister left me here. I have to go. Wait up. Hold up. Let me just... ...help you. So who's the missing person? Some local teen girl. It's weird. It's not every day we get to do real police work. - Yeah, what's that? - That? The lily among thorns. It's a shield to those who walk in integrity, guarding the paths of justice and... And watching over the way of his saints. It's proverbs 2, verse seven and eight. You a religious man? God-fearing. You? No. Not anymore. I really don't see the point. Every man for himself in my opinion. That's a lonely way of thinking, son. Your choice. I care about this town. The good lord has burdened my heart and I see it as my duty to protect 'em. Susie went out night before last and she hasn't come home. Was she alone? There was a party or something. I... I don't know where they went. I told her we couldn't afford it. Hey. It's okay, Margo. Go ahead. She wants to go to the university. I told her we couldn't afford it, she stormed out and that's the last time I saw her. I've been working at Wayne Fleener's, the graveyard shift, and I've been saving every penny that I can and I... It's just... Do you mind if I keep this? Can you tell me if she has a boyfriend, a best friend? Uh, yeah. There's this kid Nathan Miller. - She knows I don't approve. - And why is that? 'Cause he's got one thing on his mind and Susie's not very good at telling him no. She's dead, isn't she? No. No, no, no, no. Let's don't jump to conclusions, okay? I'm sure she's fine. I used to speak with someone in San Francisco, but I'm fine. My husband, he insisted I come see you. Our daughter was killed in an accident a few months ago. What happen to her? Your daughter has been a huge part of your life. If you weren't thrown off-guard by this, then something would be wrong. My husband blames me for her death. Have you forgiven yourself? Things haven't been the same since. He won't talk to me. He won't touch me. He... He's married to his job. He doesn't care. I thought moving here would change things. And why did you move here? We needed a change and Michael let me decide. I went to see Dr. Farnell today. Are you taking your meds? They make me numb. Who was the last person to see her? Are you the new guy? You're kinda cute. Miss Wilcox. Miller-comma-Nathan, her boyfriend. - They left the party early. - Yeah, where was the party? Campfire in the forest, near the old Gra... It was nothing, Mr. Police-officer-man. Nothing. Was there drugs, huh? Booze? Having a good time? - We don't kiss and tell. - They're... they're fine, man. We don't know anything. Sheriff Hendricks, I mean, you have to believe us. Where were they going? What's a man like you doing in this hick town anyway? - Miss Wilcox! - Nowhere else to go? - Why don't you answer the question? - Hell if I know. - Susie didn't tell me. - You don't know, huh? - I don't know. - I think you're lying. Hello? You and Susie Dudley, as I understand, were very good friends? A lot of history there? - Did something happen to Susie? - You tell me. - Are you suggesting that I'm keeping... - What I'm suggesting is maybe her disappearance is disturbing to you. But this is totally like Susie. - What are you talking about? - She's always running away. She and her mom were always at it. I didn't think it was a big deal. I'm sure she's fine. - Just wants the attention. - Where's her boyfriend Nathan? - I'll go pull him from class. - Yeah. So tell me about Friday night? Susie's mom said there was a party? - Yeah, we went to the bowling alley. - You're lying to me! Okay, your friends told me there was a campfire by the woods. - Why are you lying?! - It was nothing. Then why lie about it? Miss Cook. If you want to keep on track with attending that Ivy League school, - I'd advise you to answer thi... - It was just this senior-year thing with a few of us hanging out in the woods. It didn't go anywhere else? No, sir. Can I go back to class now? Eh, you know there's no need to scare the hell out of these kids, Michael. Just following your advice, huh? - And our duty to protect this town. - Murder? Michael, we haven't had that kind of trouble here in a long time. Look, people talk, especially these kids. Last thing I want is a panic you understand? Listen, I don't know what that was all about, but, uh, we got another problem. Nathan Miller didn't show up for class today. Some local fisherman found him naked, curled up on a bank this morning. They brought him here. - Where are his folks? - Both deceased. - The boy lives with his grandmother. - Hey hey hey. Hey hey, she drowned. Sh-she... she drowned. She drowned, she drowned, she drowned, she drowned. Is she dead? She drowned! She drowned. She drowned, I hear she did. I don't know. - She drowned, she drowned! - What'd you say? She drowned! She drowned! She drowned. Hey, he does this every single day. She drowned. A house divided upon itself will fall into wrack and ruin. In the great abyss the seven princesses dwell! It's a trick, it's a trick! Th... they're fakin' ya. They-they want to reach out from hell. Bring you back. Bring you back to hell! Drag you into hell-lll... - All right! - Hell... Lovely town you got here. Like I said, he does that every day. Here's our boy. Hasn't said a word since he's been here. Completely unresponsive. Any blood, bruises or anything like that? Not a trace. Something scared the hell out of him. Hey, Nathan. Hey, Nathan, it's Sheriff Hendricks here. We've got a few questions we'd like to ask you. You remember anything at all about the other night in the woods with Susie Dudley? You know where she is? Nathan? Nathan! Possibility he might be faking, doctor? That's highly doubtful. Yeah, but is there a possibility? W... Well... Of course there's a possibility, but... "Revertar in domum meam unde exivi." - What the hell's he doing? - I-I don't... No, no! No, no, don't cuff him, don't cuff him! It's too early! Shaw, either help or get the hell out of here. I'm just trying to do my job! Get him up. I've got all day, son. Where is Susie Dudley? Why don't you just tell me now? Nathan! Hey! Susie Dudley... where is she? I wanna know where she is. "Revertar in domum meam unde exivi." All right, you listen to me, you little shit! Huh? Did you see something? You tell me what happened to her. - You tell me. I need to know! - Brodie! Ease off. You know, son, finding Susie Dudley's not gonna bring your daughter back. What the hell's that supposed to mean? It just means there's some things in this damned life you're not in control of. You want me to write that down? I think you're forgetting whose operation this is. Your game's a joke. - What is it you're after, son? - I want the truth. You chase the truth like a radical crusader. - I know what I'm doing. - Do you? Yeah. Why don't you explain to me why some punk kid's speaking in a dead language. "Sad mouse lives in this house." Sad mouse lives in this house Sad mouse lives in this house... Sad mouse lives in this house Sad mouse lives in this house... Sad mouse lives in... Hello? Revertar in domum meam unde exivi. Revertar in domum meam unde exivi. Welcome back. Reporter Brennyn Danae has been follow the case of a local missing student. She is live at the location where she was last seen. - Brennyn. - The small town of Glenwood Bay is still on the lookout for missing teenager Susie Dudley, 18 years old, who disappeared two days ago. Authorities have yet to issue a statement, but our sources tell us that no arrest has been made. Sheriff Hendricks is keeping all the details in house for now but a statement should be made later today. Michael. Rachel? What are you doing here? - Hey. - I saw... Hey, hey, hey, hey, what are you doing here? I met a little girl. I followed her out to the woods. A little girl? Why don't I like where this is going? Listen to me! I watched her die. Wait a minute. You tell me, was it this little girl? - No. - Who was it, Mrs. Brodie? I don't know. It was out in this house in the woods. Michael, did you see this girl? No. Rachel, are you sure that you saw a little girl? Michael! Yes, I am sure! Do something! What is this place, huh? Just some old house. Had a suicide case awhile back. About the biggest thing to happened in Glenwood Bay. Ain't been no trouble in years. It was right here. She was right here. I saw it in the mirror. She was lying here on the ground and there was blood everywhere and... and... and she... She was just lying here and she couldn't do anything. There's nothing here. Can I talk to you? - Are you sure you saw something? - Uh-huh, I'm sure. - I'm sure. - Rachel. I'm sure. I'm sure. I promise. I've wandered through the desert and found no rest. "Swept and garnished, but still empty." Hello? Revertar in domum meam unde exivi. What the hell are you doing, huh? Rachel! - Rachel. - Nothing! Nothing. Who is she? I don't know. She seemed scared. Scared of you? Why would she be scared of me? - Of what then? - I don't know. Do I look nuts to you? What is it you're hiding, Mrs. Brodie? I can't do this. I-I-I'm sorry. I tried. Look at you. Look at you. Look at you. All scrubbed and garnished, but you still ain't clean. No, no, no, you can't dig up the truth if you want to play the game. It's all lies. Lies! There's a resurrection of the mind. Susie Dudley's still missing. I heard her boyfriend Nathan done it. I heard he went crazy. My daughter's friend told her about it. Well, Sheriff Hendricks ain't saying a word, but I heard someone saw Susie sneaking around the old Granville place. I'll tell you what, something ain't right about that house. Devil's playground. There's something evil out there. It's cursed and it always will be. Revertar in domum meam unde exivi. What does it mean? "I will return to my house from which I came." He's talking about unclean spirits. Unclean spirits? You really believe in this hocus-pocus? The house he's referring to is the body. The demon returning to the place where it once dwelled, - but only if it's an empty vessel. - An empty vessel? Souls. Luke 11, verse 26, the demon goes and gets seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell within the vacant soul. The person ends up far worse than they were before. You ever see anything like this? No. S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A. S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A. - S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A. - Protect us. "Against the spirits of wickedness in high places." Touch my body. Taste it. "You will not surely die." You are weak. Father Callahan? Father Callahan. What do you make of that? I believe that there are different levels of evil in the world. No rituals, no magic. It already dwells in all of us. That's it. That's the battle. This is war. There's no neutral ground. "Bethy Banks." Probably make it easier if you talked about it. Nothing. Rachel just likes to rattle my cage. Mmm. From what I saw last night, it looked like something was rattling hers. She blames herself for our daughter's death. Who do you blame? You see good people get shit on all the time and he lets it happen. So I say to hell with him. What good people, Michael? There's always been good and evil. That's the game. The curse. But really who is innocent when standing here before the almighty? We all face the enemy every single day. Just exiles wandering around. You're angry. Understandable. Don't make it worse by nursing your grudge. Otherwise you give a mighty foothold to the enemy. "When an evil spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest. It does not find it. And then it says, 'I will return to the house from which I came.'" Clear cause of death was severed arteries to the abdomen. Severe trauma to the abdominal cavity. The blade was thick and went deep. Any sign of rape? Autopsy shows signs of semen, along with severe vaginal tearing. I won't have the DNA match back for a few more days, but I, uh, I did find these markings to be very odd. Oh my God. "S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A." Sheriff? Hendricks! "The adversary of iniquity prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour." Not this time. Gather your hearts. We're about to stand against the schemes of the wicked. Miss Dudley. What's happened? Where's... Where's Jed? What happened? - Susie. - Is she okay? No. Sh... She's gone. - She's dead. - No. No, you're... you're lying. I want you to know I am so sorry. Where did you find her? We had to pull her out of... Did she suffer? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Do you know who did this? Nathan. I want you to know right here and now that whatever it is... that... that you're going through, I'm gonna be there for you. I am. What the hell are you doing? You're nothing. You're not a man. - Rachel, that's not funny. - You... let your household fall. - Okay, Rachel, stop this, huh? - What's gotten into you? We were never enough. Emily needed a father. - Rachel, that's enough. - You killed her! - Hey! - You killed your baby girl. Do not say something like that! You're a fake. - What the hell's wrong with you, huh? - Give yourself up for her! Cleanse her! Sanctify her by washing her of water with the word. Never has one hated their own flesh. Hold fast. - One flesh. - Stop this, huh?! Lies and tricks. You deceitful bastard. Stop it! Stop it. Get out of here. Get out of here! You're not welcome! You're not welcome! You're not wel... Stop it. Stop it! Stop it. I should've stood by her side. I should've listened to her. I can't explain what I saw. I don't even know if I believe it myself, but... I know I can't control it. The mind's a prison of your own making. Funny thing about that little fella... so small to be carrying all that weight by himself. Yeah, but he's still carrying it. You love your wife, Michael? Show her. It just ain't right. The man's been through hell and back with his wife. - His wife? - I'd listen to him. What are you talking about? It probably ain't my place to say. This town is full of secrets. We're all just creatures of habit. We don't look to right our wrongs. We just... We just live with them. Have you noticed any strange patterns with your wife? Fits? Blackouts? Self-mutilations? Your wife wrote that phrase... 20 years ago. She was a patient here. I-I was just an intern, but I'll never forget it. We brought her in and we observed her very closely... Blanch Rachel Banks. This is bullshit. You're both... you're both full of shit. The both of you, you're full of shit! We get so tangled in our regrets of the past. We think we can just bury it forever, create a new identity, start over. But the truth... will surface. - I dare you to go inside, Bethy. - Mom said not to go inside. - You're such a mama's girl. - No, I'm not. I hate you! Blanch, Blanch, no! Where is your sister... Beth? Am I my sister's keeper? Why are you angry? If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? Where is your sister? Her blood cries out to me from the ground. No, leave me alone, please! No, no, no, no, no. Rachel, Rachel. This can't be... this can't be happening. It's an anagram. "Asmodeus." From the book of Enoch. It's a Hebrew word which means "to destroy." Asmodeus is referred to as one of the seven princes of hell. A fallen angel cast down to the earth from the war in heaven. A... a demon of lust, hate and jealousy, responsible for twisting men's desires. The cops never found her body. What body? When the police discovered your wife she was inside an abandoned home, shaking uncontrollably. We brought her in and we observed her very carefully. She didn't speak for weeks. And when she finally did talk, she said that her sister Bethy had been raped and killed. She was lying. Blanch, this isn't funny. Blanch! Shhh. Are... are you telling me that my wife - is possessed by a... - The mind is a powerful thing. She did everything she could to block it out. Hendricks! Son of a bitch. My God. What happened? We're all just creatures of habit. I... I wanted her. We grasp onto it. Capable of anything. I couldn't stop myself. Don't touch me! Nathan, Nathan! Please! Get off me! Don't! I can't live with myself for what I did. I killed her. Hendricks? Hendricks? "Martha May Hendricks began to be disturbed by scratching sounds that came from the basement..." "...and objects were often found to be moved without explanation. She reported to her husband that she'd felt rejected and alone..." "...and had been invaded by an invisible entity." "When her husband was out of town, Martha May claimed she was being attacked by an unseen force." "...followed out to the Granville estate, where an exorcism was attempted." S-U-E-D-O... "She killed herself with a blade after a failed attempt of exorcism by father Callahan of Cornerstone." No! Father Callahan. "Martha May Hendricks is survived by her husband deputy Jed Hendricks." How could you cover this up? How could you lie about this? You think you know a lot, but... You don't know the whole story. I know you're hiding behind this. I wasn't acting under God's authority and power when I did the deliverance. Was I wrong? Absolutely. What is it that you want from me? My wife needs your help. I can't. Look, this-this... this is your chance for redemption right here. No one else has seen this before. I need your help. I'm beggin' you. I swore I wouldn't do it again. Please. I can't. I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do. You're a coward! That's all you are! You're a fake! Oh my God. What have you done? S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A. S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A. I know what you did. Your wife is a whore in hell. You took everything from me. Rachel! Put the knife down, okay? - Rachel. - Rachel? Oh, she's not here right now. We can work this out, okay? S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A. S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A. S-U-E-D-O... S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A. I've wandered through the desert and found no rest. "Swept and garnished, but still empty." Rachel! Rachel! "Go proclaim the word. Whoever believes will be saved." If you don't, you die. Your blood spills. "Oh, in my name they will cast out demons, speak in tongues, pick up snakes." At the right hand of God I sit. All authority on earth has been given to me. Rachel! Rachel. It's me. It's Michael. Hey, sweetie, listen, it's gonna be okay, okay? Hey! Rachel! Rachel, listen to me! Rachel, it's me! It's me! - Rachel! - "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents." Rachel! Lie with me, priest. Take my body. Taste it. I know you want to. Father, give me strength. You're weak. Taste my body, priest. Touch it. "You will not surely die." Help me, father. I lay my fears at your feet. I know what you did. You ran away! A scared-shitless priest. You are a coward! A fake! - Give me your name! - You wanna touch me. - You wanna taste me. - Give me your name. Give me your seed, priest! - Ha! - Give me your name! Fear me. Doubts and lies, priest. Doubts and lies! You fake! Come on, priest. Oh, you can do better than that. I know you can. Come on, hit me. Hit me really hard. "Anointed guardian cherub, in the midst of stones and fire you walk." "I cast you as a profane evil from the Mountain of God. And I destroy you!" "You have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more forever!" All of this I give to you, if you bow down and worship me. - You're a fake. Who is your master? - Seven dwell inside me. - You're a coward! Say his name! - Him I know. You I don't. "I saw his spirit come down from the sky like a dove." Say his name! You're a coward. Say his name! Say his name! His name! "You have come to a dreadful end!" Say his name. Say his name! Yeshua! Yeshua! Ye-shu-aaa! This changes things, doesn't it? Hey, I think you're getting better. - You know I'm not. - No. Why are you here? 'Cause we're on the same side, Rachel. I love you and I will spend the rest of my life showing you that. You need to leave. I'm sorry. You were there and you kept it a secret. You know, when I was a kid my daddy took me to the Rialto to see "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance." Mmm! John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Lee Marvin. When 'ol Liberty come strolling through town, he'd just take whatever the hell he wanted. That is until Ransom Stoddard had the courage to stand up for the town. He got beat down, kicked, spit on, but he looked fear in the eye with courage and integrity. That stuck with me. Didn't give an inch. What happened to your wife? Jesus Christ, you gotta help us. I can't do it without you! I'm sorry. I can't do it! I'm sorry! You can never satisfy me the way that he did. I carry his seed inside of me. You're weak. Hendricks, don't do it. You're a fake. Come on do it. Do it! Hendricks, no, stop! No! Martha May, she brought that demon into our home where it dwelled and-and-and seduced her and tortured her. Michael, temp... temptation to give into evil, it comes from us and only us. She knew what she did. There's no one to blame but the s... seducing and-and-and leering flare-up of our own lust. That's where my wife found fulfillment, but it was a lie! She allowed evil to-to-to flourish and that became the real killer! - You killed an innocent person. - She was not innocent! She was in the arms of another man! I did what I had to do. That's a lonely way of thinking, don't you think? Funny thing about that little fella... so small, still carrying all that weight by himself. But he's still carrying it. We all have our... trove of secrets, regrets. That was the worst day of my life, Michael. There's not a day goes by I don't run it over and over and over and over and over and over... Oh God, I wish I could stop my anger, that blade. Pride comes... Disgrace follows. I... I realize I don't have what it takes anymore. I'm done. I'm finished. "Wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from this body of death?" I'm finished. Mimic the one who took a stand, didn't give an inch. I'll be damned. You a religious guy? God-fearing. I believe that there are different levels of evil in the world. No rituals. No magic. It already dwells in all of us... that's it, that's the battle. This is war. There's no neutral ground. What if I disappear, disappear? What if I fall? Would I ever make it Back at all? Dreaming, fading Standing here It's almost funny now It's almost funny now What if I disappear, disappear? What if I fall? Would anything be the same? Everything's changed Everything's changed Dreaming, fading Standing here It's almost funny now It's almost funny now What if I disappear, disappear? What if I fall? Would anything be the same? - Everything's changed - Everything's changed What if I run away, run away, run away? Went up in flames How long can I hold on? Everything's changed Everything's changed Everything's changed.
