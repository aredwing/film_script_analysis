And get your last week of being single undocumented, not a chance! Seriously, turn it off. Yeah, I understand, but I asked for three beds, and there's only two. Okay, thanks. I need a drink. Let's get this vacation started. - I'm gonna have a pia colada. - That sounds fun. You're a bachelorette, you can do whatever you want. May I... may I have a pia colada, please? - Oh, don't be nervous, we're harmless. - Don't turn away. - This is so relaxing. - Here is to your freakin' bachelorette! - To me! - Woo! Yeah! - Cheers. - Cheers. Oh, it's so good. Maybe I should've bought one. I think we need some shots. We're here to have fun. We will. - Jill? - Yeah? Are you having one? Delicious. I'd like to make a toast. Casey! Get out here, please. Whatever happens tonight, know that we love you and we care for you. - And I'm so proud of... - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - What is it? - There's a bug in the toilet! - What does it look like? - I don't know! It's a bug! I mean, seriously, his mother hates me. She thinks I'm ruining his life. Well, of course she does. I mean, you're taking away her baby boy. Ugh, we live in the same building. She's making sure that you're not defiling him before marriage. You know, it is weird that she's making him make you wait. I mean, how old-school is she? Who waits for marriage anymore? Lots of rum! ...alcohol in here? I just don't know. I mean, like, how do I know that this is it? How do I know that Jared is actually the one? Honey, you are so totally fine, okay? I mean, Jared loves you and he's smart. - And... and he's so... - He's good looking. - He's good looking! - And he's an investment banker. - He's an investment banker. - He's probably great in bed. Guys, let's just go. Honey... I'm getting married! Woo! - Anything? - Anything. Guys! Guys! Guys! You've gotta come hear this! Come! - Hey, where have you been? - It's amazing. Come! Hurry up! It's called the Buddha Strand Sea of Stars. It's the most beautiful place on earth. The water is so clear, that once you step in it, - it's like you're standing on the sky. - Wow. So, how do we get there? You can't. It's not really a tourist thing. Oh, come on. There must be something we can do, right? Okay, we enter here. Are we seriously doing this? We're doing this! Get your ass in there! Are we almost there? I don't know. Is that the hill? - I don't know. - This doesn't look like anything on the map. Ugh! Guys, I'm getting eaten alive out here. - We're here! - We're here! Woo! - We're getting in that water. - I can't believe we actually found it. - Let's just go investigate a little? - Come on, Jill! - Don't fall. - Oh, it's so nice! I thought it was supposed to be white sand. Oh, my God. It's so nice! - The water's so beautiful! - Kirsten! - Ugh. - Stick your head under. - How's the water? - Why don't you come in and find out? Yeah! You know you gotta tell him, right? - What? - Jared, he's got the right to know. - Jill! - What? Not the time or the place. It's none of our business. I will! I will tell him. - He wants kids more than anything. - I know. And you don't. I know. I'll tell him. - Ow! - What? I just felt something in the water. Oh, my God! I think something bite me! - Yeah, I know, I'm covered. - No, I mean, under water, Jill. Oh, it's because you're so tasty, baby. Tasty! - Oh, I just felt something there. - What? - Jill? Jill! - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - Jill! - Jill? What happened? - I think there's something in the water! - Casey! Casey! Get out! Get out! - Jill! Jill? - Jill? - You shit head! Jill! - I'm sorry, I had to! - I'm coming over! - You bitch! - Are you alright? - No, something bit me. Aww, are you okay? Yeah. It's just a little bite. - Hello, beautiful. - Hi. You're home. - Yeah. - Why aren't you at work? Well, I wanted to see you. I missed you. I missed you too, so much. You better have. How was it? It was fun. It was a lot. I don't even know where to begin. What? - I have a surprise. - What? - Keep your eyes closed. Okay? - Okay. Alright, that's it. Just move forward. - Okay, no peeking. - You're really bad at this. Shh. I'm trying to have a moment here. If you're taking me to the bedroom, I need to shower first. Getting warmer. And stop. You ready? I... I dug it out of my mom's storage last month. And I found a guy in the village, that restores antiques. It was my father's before it was mine. I mean, for whenever we're ready. It's... it's beautiful, babe. That didn't take long. I can call him later. It's okay. So? Do you love it? I... - Ah, damn. I'm sorry, baby. It's Chuck. - Tell him I say hi. I wanna hear all about your trip tonight, okay? I promise, okay? Hey, Chuck. How you doing? Ow. Hey, Mrs. Kennedy. Where's the mister? - Working. Where else? - You serious? You just got back. Yeah, well, he's not the one on vacation. Seriously, sweetie, you need to sit Jared down, tell him this workaholic act needs to stop. Yeah. There are a lot of things we need to talk about. The ring... The ring, and just... Honey, you're not still getting cold feet, are you? We talked about this. No, I just... Okay, it better not be about that creep on the trip. - Kirsten! - I'm sorry. I'm just asking. - I mean, hell, I feel guilty about it. - No, it's just... It's about a lot of things. - You're back. - Hi, Mrs. Kennedy. The bugs seemed to like you. Oh... yeah. I actually think the insects over there, prefer the taste of bug-spray. So, I was just doing laundry, and I ran out of detergent before I left. Do you have some? A woman doesn't run out of detergent. Dmitri called. You haven't decided on the wedding band. Yeah, I know. I just got back today. But I have it on my list to call him tomorrow. And the caterer? And the florist? You have a deposit due for the dress. And Myrna won't finish the alterations, until you pay it. - I know. - You know? And still you left on some trip, with your friends. Well, I'm back now. Who would've known weddings would be this hard, right? Marriage is hard. Kids are hard. You know nothing of either. If you can't handle something so silly, so simple, as a wedding... then I pray for my son. Don't forget your detergent. - This is it. We're here! - You look beautiful. It's fine! Look at this rock! This is a rock! Hi, Cyrano! How's my favorite puppy? I missed you so much. Yes, I did! - We were hoping you'd stop by today. - Hi, Mr. Matheson. Poor boy. He's been moping about for over a week. I don't think I've seen him this sad since Silvia passed. So, how was your trip? Exhausting. It's good to be back. That's for sure. - Vacations can do that. - Do what? Well, make you miss the little things. - It's good to have you back, Casey. - Thanks, Mr. Matheson. It's good to be back. Well, you two go have fun. And thanks for walking him. Thanks. We will. Come on, boy. Come on. Come on. Come on, Cyrano. I have to postpone the wedding. I just... I can't do it. - I know. I know it's really hard. - I can't do it. - I'm not ready. - I know, honey. That's why you need to talk to him, tonight. Tell him how you feel. You owe it to him and yourself. If you wait any longer, it will be too close to the wedding to turn back. And how... Mom, please. Enough already. I don't want to hear it anymore. Well, you're going to. Mom, Casey and I are getting married. You need to start accepting it. You're my son. The only good thing I have in this wretched world, and I will not just watch you make the same mistakes I did. For the last time, Mom, my fianc is not, nor has she ever, cheated on me. That's what I said about your father. She's not good for you. I've gotta go. I'll see you later. - You're late. - I know. I'm sorry, babe. Work was... Yeah. Are you mad? No. Come on, dinner's getting cold. So Chuck looks at this guy and he says, "What are you fucking kidding me? "Homeless Henry, on 9th dresses better than you do." Then, babe, I swear to God, Chuck looks this guy right in the eyes, and he says, "Get the fuck out of my office, "and don't come back until you buy a decent suit." Casey, you okay? Yeah, I just... I just must have caught a bug or something. Hey, where's your ring? Oh, I wanted to clean it after the trip. It's just soaking in the bathroom. Oh, you know you've got to watch out, what you put your ring in. It's white gold, so... Jared, we need to talk. Okay. I've been thinking a lot about the wedding. - And about a lot of other things. - I know. My mom was telling me, you're a little bit behind on the planning. She said she's totally willing to help. It's not that. I just... - Babe, are you sure you're alright? - Yeah. I just... - Casey, you alright? - I'm fine! I'll be out in a minute. That didn't sound good. Must be the food from the trip. You know me. Well, I guess we're done with dinner. Sorry. Come on, let's get you to bed, get you some rest. Okay. Touchdown. How you feeling now? Better. I'd like you to stay. You know, when I got a place here, to help my mom with the building, I thought I was only gonna be here for a couple months. I couldn't wait to get back to the upper east side. And then I met you. And I didn't want to leave. Your mother won't know if you stay the night. Have you met my mother? She'll know. - She hates me. - What? That's not true. She does. You won't even sleep here because of her. She's just a little old fashioned, that's all. Hey, listen to me. I love you. And next week, you and I will be husband and wife. And after that, we'll leave this place, and we'll... start our lives together. She'll come around, you'll see. Okay? Okay. - Casey. - Come on. - Casey, we should wait. - Shut up. - Casey. - Shut up. - Casey. - Shut up. Casey? I'm fine! Everything's fine! What the hell was that? I'm fine! It's just a small bug bite from the trip. Well, it looks infected. Yeah, I have some cream for it. Just gonna take a bath first, wash it out. Really? So we're done here? You have an early morning. You should go before your mom notices. Well, are you at least gonna say goodbye? Good night. Well, have a good night. Where have you been? Flake much? Sorry. Rough night. You too? It is like the worst diarrhea ever. I told Kirsten we shouldn't have drank the water. I know, right? Well, look at you, miss Molly Homemaker. He must've known something was up, if you cooked for him. So? What did you say? I didn't tell him. You didn't tell him? Jesus, Casey, the wedding is in a week. I know. I know. I just couldn't tell him. Last night, I couldn't tell him. It's okay. It's okay Honey, you know I love you, right? - And I love Jared too. - Yeah. He's a great guy. He's established, he's mature, he's good looking. And he's ready. But, honey, you're not ready. If nothing else, our trip proved that. Did he notice your ring is gone? And you lied to him about it, I assume. Oh, honey, it's okay. Oh, it's alright. You're gonna be fine. You'll see. What? One of my bites, I think it's infected. It hurts. Look, ever since we came back from this trip... Oh, tell me about it. Look, I'm covered. But I went to the dermatologist yesterday, and he gave me this cream. - You need to use it. It helps. - Yeah. But I have to get to work, honey, okay? I'll talk to you later? Yeah, yeah. Kirsten? Kirsten? Get up. It's Casey. - Is she okay? - I found her. I don't know. Let's go. Casey? Casey, what happened? Casey? Casey! Casey, wait. Casey! Oh, my God, Casey? Did someone have a good time last night? I don't know what happened. I woke up naked on the beach. Everything was gone. My clothes, my purse. The ring, my ring is gone. - Where the hell did you go? - I don't know! I can't fucking remember. Jill, are you filming this? What the fuck is wrong with you? Turn it off. - Morning, Casey. - Hi, Mr. Matheson. Dear, you're as pale as a ghost. Yeah, I must have caught a bug down south. I'll be fine. You have to watch it down there. They have all sort of weird critters. Cyrano? Hey. Come on, let's go for a walk. Hmm. Cyrano? That's very strange. Cyrano, come. Come on, boy. Come see Casey. Come on, you lazy dog. Come. Cyrano, come here. Cyrano! I don't know what's gotten into him. I'm sorry, Casey. Maybe he's not feeling well either. Maybe he just wants to stay in today. We can try it again tomorrow. Yeah. Okay. - I'll come by in the morning. - We'd look forward to that. - Hello? - Hey. - Hey, what's up? - What are you doing? Are you sure about this? About postponing? When are you gonna tell him? I don't know. Tonight maybe. You know, why don't you just sleep on this? It just seems a little impulsive. Hey... have you been sick at all, since our trip? Yeah, I've been tired as a motherfuck. I'm telling you, I am never traveling again. Why? Are you okay? You know, you don't look so good. Yeah. I don't know. I can't eat anything. I can't keep food down. - Maybe you're pregnant. - What? Don't even say that. - Are you sure? - Yes. I'm not pregnant. I'm not. I can't be. It's not possible. Hi, Barker's After Hours Clinic. Hi, I was in Costa Rica last week, and I got bit by something in the water. Okay, what did it look like? I don't know. I didn't see it. Are you looking at the bite mark now? - Yes. - And what color is it? - Red. - Does it look infected? Yeah, and it hurts. And there's this weird white liquid, that just keeps coming out. Okay, that's just pus. Have you put any antiseptic on it? - No. - That's the first thing you should do. Any over the counter corticosteroid, should kill the infection. Okay. As for the vomiting, it may be caused by the infection, or maybe not. You should probably see your physician to know for sure. There's one more thing. I'm pregnant. - Hello? - Office of Doctor Martin Langstaff. We're currently closed. Please leave us a message. Hello, this is... this is Casey Morgan. I'm not feeling well, and... I need to speak to a doctor as soon as possible. Please call me back. It's Casey Morgan. Surprise! Babies! Babies! Babies! Babies! Babies! Babies! Babies! Babies! No! No! No! No, please! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Please, stop! You're killing them! No! Don't! Stop! Stop! Please, stop! Stop, please! Stop! Stop! Please! Stop! Stop, please stop! Stop! Please, no! No. No, no, no, no, no. Casey? Casey! I know you're in there! Answer the door! I know you're in there! Answer the door! Casey! Open up! What are you doing here? What is wrong with you? You shouldn't be here. No, this is exactly where I should be. I've had complaints about the smell. What is this? I know what you are. You harlot! I asked you for one thing. Do not soil my son, out of wedlock. You couldn't even do that. You're filthy. Look at this place! You're disgusting! I know that is not my son's child in you. So tell me the truth. Whose child is it? Please leave. When I tell him tonight, the wedding will be canceled. And you and your bastard won't get a penny from us. Whose child is it? Leave now. Answer me. Answer me! Hey, it's Casey. Leave a message. Hey, it's me again. What's going on, Case? I live 50 feet away and I haven't seen or heard from you in days. Come on, fill me in here. Give me a call. Something, please. Anything. Casey, open up. - Casey, I'm coming in. - Jared! - Casey, open the door and let me in. - I can't do it. What do you mean? Just open the door. Let me in. No. The wedding! I can't do it! What do you mean you can't do the wedding? I'm not ready. I can't do it! Just open up. We need to talk about this. I love you, Jared! I just need some time... ...to figure things out. Casey, open the door. Casey, open the door. - Open up! - Jared, leave! Jill? Jill, open the door. - Oh, hey, what's up? - Why are you avoiding me? What? I'm not, I've just been busy. Why? What's the emergency? In case you haven't noticed, Casey's been M.I.A. for a week. She's not answering any of my calls or texts. Yeah, I know. I got her voicemail too. I just wanted to give her space. This whole decision with Jared, she must be taking it pretty hard. Well, yeah, you think? We went on this trip together, and we said we'd watch out for each other. And look what happened. This is our fault. All of us. Give me a break, Kirsten, okay? She made her own decisions down there. No one forced her to cheat on Jared. I don't remember signing up to be her babysitter. Wow. Jill, nice. You know what? Whatever. Regardless of what you think happened down there, we need to figure out what's going on with her. She's probably just lying in her bed crying, and eating a huge tub of ice cream, watching a shitty Dabrowski movie. She'll be fine. Honestly, I don't know. Something feels off. I really don't think she's just ignoring us. I stopped by her apartment yesterday. And she didn't answer but... But what? I smelled something coming from inside. Something really bad. I'm just... I'm just worried that she... Come on, Kirsten! She would never do that. - She's way too much of a pussy. - Jill, what the hell is wrong with you? You know, just because you're cool with being a whore, doesn't mean everybody is. Wow. Okay. Well, it was great seeing you. Thanks for stopping by. Casey? Casey! Come on, Casey. Open up. Seriously, you're scaring me. Casey? Casey, seriously! Casey, you're scaring me. Don't go in there. Casey? Oh, my God, Casey you scared the shit out of me. Where have you been? And what is all this? What happened in here? I'm... ...sick. Casey, talk to me here. Why have you been ignoring me? Kirsten, I'm so scared. Oh, my God. Casey, I was so worried about you. You should have called me. Hey, come on. Let's get you out of here. - I can't! - Yes, you can. Come on. No, I can't leave now. Casey, your face... Kirsten, don't be scared. Kirsten, don't be scared. Kirsten, don't be scared. Kirsten! Kirsten, please. Kirsten, please don't go in there. Kirsten, don't go in there! Kirsten, don't go in there! Kirsten! Casey, Casey, it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. I'm calling an ambulance. Kristen, open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open it! Open the door! Kirsten, open the door! Open the door! Kirsten, open the door! Oh, Kirsten, I'm sorry! Kirsten! I'm sorry! Kirsten, I'm sorry. Kristen, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! No! No! No! I'm so sorry. - Did she sleep with him? - Jared... Did she sleep with him? - I never would have done that to her. - I know. - I would have loved her and only her. - I know. I know. I'm so sorry. Jared, you deserve so much better. I... She never saw you. She never saw you like I did. Oh, Jared. Stop it! Casey? Casey, are you there? Casey. Casey? Are you here? What the fuck is that? Casey, if you can hear me... say something. Oh, my God! Casey! Oh, my God. Casey, what happened to you? Casey, please. We can get you help. We'll go to the hospital. You're going to be okay. It's really not that bad. People... People always get sick after vacations. I'm sure they've seen this before. Stop. Stop. Stop. You gotta stop. You... let that happen to me. You watched me. No. I didn't realize where he was taking you. - Remember? He was a nice guy, just... - Liar! Please don't hurt me! Please! Don't hurt me, please! You let him take me, because you wanted me to suffer. No. No. No, I don't. Or is it because you want him? - Casey, I wouldn't... - You did! I know. I heard. Call to him. Please. Please don't, Casey. You love him. So call to him. Please. Please don't. Please? Call to him. Jared. Louder. - Jared. - Louder! - Jared. - Louder! - Louder! - Jared! Jared! Jill? Casey? Jared! I'm here. I'm here, okay? - I can't move. I can't move. - What's happening? Please, you gotta get me out of here. Get me out of here! - What happened? - She's a monster. - Who is? Where's Casey? - Casey's gone. She's gone. - Okay. Okay. - She's just gone. I don't know. - Talk to me. Where's Casey? - Get me out of here! Hello, Jared. Jesus. Casey? Do you still think I'm pretty? - What happened to you? - Do you still want to have babies with me? - Please. Please don't. - Shut up! Look, Casey, I don't understand... Just talk to me. Casey? Casey? - Somebody help! - Shut up! No. No. No. No. Jill? Jill? No. No. No. Why would you do that? Instinct. Stop. I'm sorry, Jared. I'm sorry. - What's wrong with you? - It's just... it's just a little bug bite. Will you help me? Please? Please? Please. Yeah. Good. Alright, stay back. Keep back, please. Keep back. Thank you. Excuse me. Jesus Christ. We're gonna need backup, to help quarantine this unit. I need E.M.S. and Hazmat, A.S.A.P. Clear! Someone's alive in here. Oh, my God. Last time we went on vacation, I got so sunburned, literally like, bubbling up on my shoulders. Come on! Don't tell me that. I just want to enjoy this trip. Just tired of hearing everyone's travel horror stories. I'm just telling you so you don't make the same mistake. Get plenty of sunscreen. I am telling you, the sun in Costa Rica, is relentless. Your pale skin is gonna light up like a match. I'm not an idiot. I'll wear sunscreen. Okay, I'm not an idiot either, and it happened to me. I'm just saying. I just wanna go away, and relax and not worry about anything. Sunburns, I can deal with. I just don't want to get sick. Ouch! Oh, my God. That is so disgusting! Are you okay? Yeah, it's just a little bite.
