Here, I have just placed the results. ...of the internationaI programming contest. As you know, we sent a team. They came in fourth place. And I think we should make a lot of noise for our team. Whoo- Hoo! - Great! Excellent, excellent. Great job! Hi, Jane. - Hey, Dr. Smith. Hey, good circle! Thanks! - Great! Hi. Jane! So, Jane, I've been wondering, about your family. Do you have any family or anything? I haven't met anybody yet or? Well, I have a brother as a matter of fact. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be going to this nice schooI ...and staying in the nice dorm I'm staying in. That's really nice of him. Well, except for one thing. I don't really like him. What? You don't like your own brother? Why? Well, I can't really explain it, I just don't like him. What about you parents? Well, they were divorced when I was young. My dad took off with some young girI... ...and left my mom with my brother and myself. She had to raise us all by herself. She had a tough life, and, she... Shortly after that, died. Oh! And my father died a little while after he left us. But, speaking of my brother... I think it's time I go meet him. Where is he? I'd like to meet him. He's gonna meet me after schooI. But before you meet my brother, I need to warn you. He's involved with a group of really shady characters. He's extremely jealous. Does he know you joined our band? I'm not sure. You think you're so bad with that kicking shit. What's this stuff, man? Jeff, this is my friend, John. Hello, Jeff. Heard a lot of good things about you. Where'd you find this son of a bitch? He's a friend of mine from schooI. A friend? How can you act like that? Shut up! Son of a bitch! How can you go out with this piece of shit! I'm sick of you acting like this! How could you do this? How could you even call yourself my brother? Enough! That guy is not for you! What happened, John? Huh? Are these bums your friends? There is just some misunderstanding. You don't understand. I'm her brother. When I tell you leave her alone, leave her alone. Whatever you say. Just remember what I said if you don't wanna get hurt. You don't scare me at all. Jane, I wanna talk to you later. At all. Goodbye! Let's go. Hey, John, you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. But if Jane wasn't there, I'd have kicked his ass. What are you in here for, man? Now look... - Wasting my time? I thought I fired you! Yeah! You fired me, why? 'Cause of the goddamn Dragon Sound? That's bullshit! They came in here to play goddamn songs for kids! Now, who are you bullshitting? They play a lot better than you, man! You play music for old people! They play goddamn kiddy music! Your music's for old people, buddy! Hey, look, fat man, you don't know what music's all about! I'll tell you what, are you deaf? You sure don't know how to play, I'll tell you that! Kiss my ass! - Got it? That's it, buddy! You're history! You're full of shit! - You wanna go out of here... Son of a bitch, you get out of here! You, son of a... Don't you give me a hard time! You son of a bitch! Next time I'll kill your ass! Hey, this is Jeff. Is Yashito there? No, he's caught up with some business. But he's been waiting for your call. Well, I had some problems getting the money together. The Yaho's in Miami, you need to get here right away. Okay, I got it! Did you have a good time? Thank you for your hospitality. Do not forget what you have to do. Don't worry. I won't disappoint you. Anyway, how is your sister? I'm really concerned about her. She's still hanging around with that damn band Dragon Sound. Better take care of her. Concentrate on our business. Anyway, we need to get rid of that band... ...so you can controI that area. Don't worry. I already have that planned. See you in Miami soon, won't I? Hey, we have to eat fast, so we can get down to the club on time. Yeah, we better get a move on. Ah, taste good? Yes, taste good. Uncle Song, you take great care of us. Hmm. Good. Uncle Song, you have to give Mark the recipe to this. We love you. Against the ninja. We will fight the battle to win.

I'm taking a shower first. Go for it, Jim. Hey, Jim. I got a letter for you. A letter? - It's from Washington D.C. Hey, give it to me. - What's the story? Give it to me! - Huh? Give me the letter! - What's your little secret? Give me... Give me the damn letter, now! Give me the letter! Okay. Well, okay. You can have it! Give me the letter, now. Okay, okay, grab it. Take it! Give me the letter! Try again! Now! Seriously, you guys, what's going on out here? What's going on here? What's going on? What're you trying to do? Wake up the neighbors? I need to get some work done. You think you would've had enough done from that street fight. What's going on here? You guys trying to wake up the neighbors or what? Calm down. Haven't seen enough action for one night? John, what happened? - Get enough, I'll tell you. Jim, what happened? - You guys fighting or what? He got this letter and he's all... What letter? John, what happened? I don't know. He won't tell me. Huh? Jim. What happened? Jim, what is this letter? Tell us. Go ahead, tell us. Why don't you explain to us? Come on, we're your best friends. Sorry for hiding this from you, guys? Oh, man, what's it? But... This looks like your brother. I didn't know you have a brother. It's my father. What? This is your reaI father? Yes, it is. Are you sure? I didn't know. You had a father. I thought we are all orphans. My mother was Korean... ...and my father was black American. She gave me this picture when she was reaI sick. I was only nine years old. They say that they loved each other and they were reaI loyaI. They were really happy. But then, when he finished military duty... ...he left. And we never saw him again. She told me to find him. But I didn't like him because he left us. But I knew, one day, when I grew up I'd find him. Whether he was dead or alive. I sent a couple. ...letters to the defense department... And nothing happened. Friends through eternity, loyalty, honesty. We'll stay together through thick or thin. Friends forever, we'll be together. We're up top 'cause we play to win. You've got a friend in me. Oh- wee! GirI! Make it with a rockstar! Hey, baby! Look good. Hey, all right! Hey! Over here! Look at that! They don't make buns like those down at the bakery. Baby, I need you! We'll make our dreams come true. There's nothing we can't do. We've been together for so long. Excuse me, madame, may I have a little kiss please? A little kiss please. Come on. Come on. Whoa! Who the hell are you? Jerk. He's an asshole! Just get out of here! Get away from us! - Go on. Get away from us! Get lost! - Ow! No, John! No, John, no! Get out of here! Go on! Get out of here. Get out! - Get out of here! Check this guy out. Messed him up pretty bad. Look at him. Did you get the number of the truck that hit you? You ought to stay away from GirI Scouts, yeah? Okay, okay. Where's your boss? I gotta speak to him. What do you want to see him for? It's business. Just get him. Shit! This guy comes in here, he says he needs to talk to you. What do you want? I'm the leader of the group that played out of Park Avenue... we got fired and then the new group beat us up. So what? I need you to get rid of them. Get my job back. If you do, I'll join up with ya. There's just one thing you gotta know. They're all black belts in taekwondo and they're pretty bad. If you get my job back for me... ...any money I make is yours. It's that damn band again. Hey, now it's my turn. So, Mark, how do you feeI about putting some board- Breaking into the act? Sure. Why not? We could write another taekwondo song... ...and after Tom does one of his guitar solos, we could all break boards. Jack could do a drum solo. How about it, Jack? I'd love to help you write that song, John. But there's no way I'm gonna break any boards in that club. I don't even want us to play there anymore. Why? Because that other band jumped us the other night? Yeah. Because of Jeff, too. He's in there every night, with his damn gang... ...selling that stupid cocaine. Don't worry about Jeff. If he bothers us anymore, I'll make sure he regrets it. How can you reason with that guy? He punched you out the other day. ...just 'cause you're going with his sister. As long as we play in that club, he's not gonna leave us alone. How about it, Mark? Let's quit that job. Jack, I know what you mean. But, untiI you get anotherjob... ...you must continue to play there. How else can you pay for schooI? No job. No money. I don't want us to drop out... I just don't want anything to happen to us. Nothing will, Jack. I promise you that. This band is the only family I have. Me, too. You know, when I first came to this country, I had nobody. Nobody. Sounds like you're still homesick. Not like before. I bet you still miss all the taekwondo training that goes on in Korea. Everybody practice taekwondo there. Taekwondo originate in Korea. But now, it is practiced all over the world. All over the world? What do you think about a tour? What kind of tour? It would be a world tour. But, what would make it speciaI ...is that we play in each other's countries. You know, like, finding our roots. You mean we're gonna play in Ireland? Right. While we're in Europe, we'd visit Italy... ...you know, Tom's home country. We'd visit all the countries where our parents came from. Korea. Ireland. We'll play in IsraeI. That's where my parents are from. I didn't realize this before. Dragon Sound is really an internationaI band. Right, wherever we go... we'd visit the locaI taekwondo schools... we promote peace and goodwill. You think we could take a little time- Out for dinner. while we're trying to save the world? Oh! Uncle Song is expecting us tonight. How come he hasn't been working out with us lately? He's having a lot of problems with his restaurant. Hey, man. Hey, man, y'all knock that shit out. Let's get out of here. I ain't paying for this shit! Get outta here, dude. Hey, hey, hey. Why don't you pay me? Get out of here. He wants money from us? Please. Hey! I'll give you the money! What's he gonna do? Whoa! Uncle Song. How'd you do it? - Amazing! You just wiped them out! That was great. Those guys! That was great. I am so sorry for what happened. I didn't mean... You just knocked them and kicked them. I want to be able to do that. You took all of them by yourself? Taekwondo is not just kicking and punching. Taekwondo is right here and right here. Mark, you know what I mean? Yes, Uncle Song. I know what you mean. And I know what taekwondo is all about. It is a way of life. It makes Dragon Sound stick together. To be strong and gentle. Taekwondo is the best! Mark, I loved those licks you were doing. Someone left me a love letter. Sure. Shut up. Let me see. "Meet downtown. The railroad tracks. " From Jeff? So, what are we gonna do here? I guess we have no choice. Let's meet those guys and get it over with. Hey, where you going? Come here, huh? Jane? I'm fine. But it doesn't matter right now. Where've you been? I've been looking all over for you. How could you do this to me? You really embarrassed me this time. Why don't you just leave Dragon Sound alone? Okay, look. Don't concern yourself with what I'm doing. You concentrate on schooI and nothing else. I'll take care of all the other things. No, you won't. I'll take care of myself, okay? I'm old enough to do that now. And if I wanna see John, I will. Besides that, I love him. There's nothing you can do about it. So, just please leave him alone. Hey, look. We're family, you and I. I've helped you ever since you were a little girI. I've worked very hard to give you the best things in life. I don't want you to mess it up. ...by going out with a second rate musician like that John character. Listen! As your brother, now, listen to me. I don't want you to see him again. Ever. I want you to go home now, and remember what I said. I'll go home. And you are terrible! What time you got, man? Ah, they should've been here a long time ago. I remember what that son of a bitch did to my hand. They're dead meat! I'm gonna get his ass this time. For my nose, hand and shit. They're coming! Come on, let's go! You're dead meat! - You're history! That son of a bitch! Right now! Get him! Come on, big boy. Right here. Come on, boy! Come on, big boy! Right here! Cops! Let's go! Everybody out! Let's go! Get out! It's the cops! Hurry up! Hurry up! Where did everybody go? - I don't know. Looks like another gang. Ah, we need to get these gangs out of CentraI Florida anyway. That's true. - Let's get out of here. I love it when I game. Like no other man. Because I got the flame. And I'm a tough guy. When things are getting rough. And you've had enough. You need the right stuff. To be a tough guy. Trouble in the night, looking for a fight. Don't be a fool trying to be so cool. You're messing with your life. They'll cut you down to size. Best know what you're doing when you're messin' Messin' with the tough guys. The night is filled with knives Aim really high. Everyone tries to be a tough guy. It is no surprise many others die.
