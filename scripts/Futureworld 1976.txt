There you are. Yeah, that's only the beginning. The Really Big Bundle is that you're going to have a week at the most fabulous resort in the world. You're going to Delos, Ron! - Delos! - That's right, Delos. Where you may choose Roman World, a lusty treat for the senses, where beautiful robot women are yours to command and robot gladiators die at the point of your sword. Or Medieval World, an exact reconstruction of 13th century Europe, where you may live like an absolute king. Or Spa World, a garden of pleasure, where old age and pain have been eliminated. Or Futureworld, where you will be transported throughout the solar system, commanding you very own rocket ship, enjoying the favors of robot women of weightless beauty, soaring through space like an astronaut. All that and more is yours, Ron. Congratulations. You keep following me? Bye, Mac. Hello, Shorty. How many points you gonna give on the Colts? - Seven. - Seven? I got 50 says you're wrong. Ain't never gonna get rich being stupid. Just say I got a hunch. - I read your column today. - Yeah, what'd you think? It's gonna wrap a lot of garbage. Yeah, quack, quack, quack. Hey, you behind on your bills? Good morning to you too. Some guy's been calling for you every five minutes for the last two hours. Driving me nuts! - Get a number? - Nope. City desk, Browning. Is this Chuck Browning? That's right. Look, you wrote a story a couple of years ago about the trouble at Westworld. You're the same guy, right? You bet. I got a story for you, maybe a big one. All right, tell me. You crazy? I ain't giving it away. I'm in trouble. I need some money. - Okay, how much? - I don't know. All I want is for you to meet me somewhere. I'll tell you what I got, you pay me what it's worth. All right, what's your name? Frenchy. Frenchy DuPorte. Mee tme in ten mimutes at the Hyatt Regency crossover, Frenchy. What do you look like? I seen your picture. I'll find you. Anything? It's my day for long shots. Frenchy? What's the matter? Frenchy, what happened? Delos. What? Delos. - You're late. - You're right. Two years ago, the worst day in the history of Delos began with no obvious signs that anything would go wrong. The robots were behaving as programmed. And although there was some evidence of circuit malfunction, it was well within the normal parameters. Mr. Dyffy, are you saying that despite your sophisticated sensors, - What the hell are you doing here? - you had absolutely no indication about it? - Later. - None at all. Then quite suddenly, one of our most complicated robot gunslingers began to act in a most vicious manner. For the first time in our history, a robot actually killed a guest. Within a few moments Delos was in turmoil. I thought your only problem was in Westworld? No, thanks to your Mr. Browning, Westworld got the brunt of the bad publicity, but the breakdown occured throughout the resort. Mr. Duffy, I don't quite understand why you didn't shut off the power supply to your robots. We did. But they ran on reserve long enough to do a great deal of damage. - How many guests were killed? - More than 50. And of course, many of our own technicians also died. In fact, by the time we regained control, 95 members of our technical and maintenance staff had either been killed or wounded. Aside from the human loss, It was a financial and public relations disaster of the first magnitude. Now, ladies and gentlemen, those of us who have devoted our lives to creating Delos, were stunned by the events I've just shown you. Yet, we did not lose faith. Now, for the last two years, we have invested more than 1.5 billion dollars to rebuild our equipement. We have replaced every circuit, every program, every robot. The new Delos is not only the most fantastic resort in human history, it is also fail-safe. Now, last month, as you know, we re-opened the resort. Public response has been good, but, quite frankly, not as good as it should be. Our problem is the memory of a disaster at Westworld. And that's why we've come to you. We offer the IMC Network an absolute exclusive story for all media. Every phase of our operation will be open to you. And all we ask in return is that you treat us in a fair and positive manner. Arthur. Arthur, you mustn't do this to me. Not for one damn minute, do you hear me? They can hear you in the lobby, honey. I'm not talking to you, mister! Listen, you promised me that the Delos story would be mine. Exclusive to television and exclusive to me, is that right? - Yes. - Then will you tell me why this ink-stained Neanderthal was invited to our meeting? He has an angle. I want to pursue it. Well, let's call it a hunch. Oh, wonderful. And when the people at Delos find out that you have sent Mr. Bad News himself, that's the end of our exclusive. I told Mr. Duffy what I had in mind. He has no objection. - Well, I do! - Yes, I gathered as much. But I would like to remind you that while you are indeed a glamorous and highly paid television correspondent, you're still an employee. In fact, you're my employee. And unless you would like to spend the next five years doing weather and fashion in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, you will now shut up and do as you're told. Oh, yes? Yes, Arthur? We'll see about that. Excuse me. Socks, come on, lighten up. Oh, what do you want? Well, I just want to tell you I like your style. You had old Holcombe there swallowing his corporate stripes. You mean you're sorry you fired me? That was 'cause you weren't a very good reporter. Listen, I was a kid out of college who happened to think that newspapers ought to be more than dirt and bad news. That sounds like a line from an old movie. You know, you'd think that even so dumb a brain as yours would finally get the message. I happen to have 55 million viewers worldwide. You've got a couple thousand old crones in the public library. Why don't you wise up, mister? Nobody reads. Well, then you've got nothing to worry about. Now, come on, let's have a truce. I don't trust you. Well, you like me a little, don't you? Anyway, we've got a week to spend together alone, so what the hell? I don't like being called Socks. Well, I can't help that. The first time that I was with you, you had those outrageous red socks on. Took me a week to get over that. Yeah, and then you fired me. Well, now listen, that was business. Now, come on, what do you say? Truce, huh? I'll think about it. General Karnovski regrets, but he does not give interviews now. He's on vacation. Well, listen the right interview in an important American paper could be good for the General. Maybe get him a promotion. The General does not need a promotion. You've got a point. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. You mean to tell me that you've never heared of me? I mean, really. I mean, come on, you look at me. You're putting me on with those beautiful green eyes. Honey, I won, the Big Bundle! The TV contest! You must've heard of that! A montage of international types. I think that would be a good idea. Well, well, how do you do? - Terrible. - Why? I tried the Iranian oil ministers, nothing. Karnovski said nyet. That leaves Takaguchi. My last shot over there. What is it that you're after, anyway? I don't know, this Delos guset list looks like a rerun from the last Geneva Conference. Oil ministers, rocket experts, heavyweight electronic types. For God sakes, at $1,200 a day, who else could afford this? You know, you are looking for something that isn't there. You may be right. Hey, Miss Ballard. Miss Ballard, now, listen now, you have got to put me on your show. No fooling now, I am a real angle. Oh, excuse me, pal. Oh, that's all right. Listen, why don't you take that seat there? - Oh, thanks, thanks. - You bet. - What's your name? - Ron Thurlow, Ron. The Big Bundle, you know? - Ron, I'm Chuck Browning. - Hi. Ron, you don't read, do you? Me, no, I'm a tube freak. Right, well, you just sit right there, 'cause I know Miss Ballard loves to get close to her viewers. - Oh, thanks. - You bet. - Yeah. - Ciao. - Thanks, pal. - Anytime. Nice felllow. Now, listen, here's the deal, Miss Ballard. You see, now, I am a common type man, but you see, right now, well, I'm a big winner. Now, that's news, right? Yes, that's right, Ron, but let me tell you something. You see, the video crew isn't here on this trip. This is just a research trip, you see. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - Doggone that's too bad. - Sorry. Hey, do you know what this fella told me? He told me, "Once you make it with a robot chick, "that's it, you don't never want nothing else." I swear to God, that's what he told me. Are you going to do it? Do what, Ron? Have sex with a robot? Not this trip, Ron. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Salahari International Airport. Delos passangers may proceed directly to the resort. All others, please go to Customs and Immigration. Thank you. We have four special subjects now arriving. Open the SR in progrid for file record. Subject Karnovski, file record number SR0072. Subject Takaguchi, file record number SR0075. Subject Ballard, file record number SR0074. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Delos, the most unique resort in the history of the world. All guests will please proceed to the proper color level of the world you've chosen to visit. You will then be escorted to our costume rooms for selection and fitting. Thank you. - Futureworld? - Yeah, that's me. Please, come this way. Sure will, ooh man, you are some kind of machnery. All the girls on Futureworld as pretty as you are? Oh, yes, sir, they come in all shapes and sizes. Whatever you desire. Honey, you are perfect. Oh, no sir, I'm a 500. I'm not programmed for sex. - Futureworld, huh? - Mmm. Well, Duffy wasn't lying about one thing. What's that? This place is three time larger than the old one. - Is it? - You bet, and how. Well, it's all set, a day or two in Futureworld, and you can come back stage with me and see the hard work behind the magic. Of course, at any time, you're free to go where you wish. No restrictions? Well, for your own safety, we can't have you wandering off just anywhere. But whatever you want to see, we'll be glad to show you. Well, that's a hell of a lot better than the last time I was here. Well, we have blast off scheduled in half an hour. And you, Miss Ballard, are the commander of the flight. I am? Medieval World guests are reminded that no cameras may be taken beyond this area. Please, leave all cameras and photographic equipment at the costume desk. - Mr. Takaguchi? - Yes. I'm very sorry, I've checked with control, and it's impossible for you to use your father's sword. - We're very sorry. - Quite right, I understand. Your weapons must, of course, be very special. I'm really very nervous. Oh, no, there's nothing to worry about. It's all play-like, we're not really going anywhere. I don't think. Ta-da. - So, how do I look, huh? - Not too shabby, come on. Oh, not so bad yourself. My name is Eric. This is Erica. We will be ypur guides in Futureword. Now, if you will all follow us, we will take a tram to the launch area. Please, stay in the group. Those selecting Futureworld are in route to the Aries II space shuttle, which will take you to a rendez-vous to the Voyager starship now in orbit. Aboard the starship, you will be able to walk in space and on the surface of the moon. You will also see the Martian ice caps, ride an asteroid, and experience all the thrills of deep space. All Futureworld guests are reminded that Futureworld is a perfectly safe environment designed for your pleasure. Any appearance of danger is simply a device to enhance your experience. In Futureworld, nothing can go wrong. ...relaxed morality in beautiful Pompeii. Please, indulge your every whim. Whatever you wish, will be yours. Follow me, please. Wow, I could open the program with this. Yep. Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready to board. Please, follow me. Step right up here. Thank you. Watch your steps, please. - Right in here. - In there? Watch your steps, please. Yes? Am I doing all right? You are doing fine. Just follow the program as Chuck reads it off to you. This is Houston Control. - All systems are in a go status. - Hey, Socks. - We are at T-minus 1 minute 20 seconds and counting. - Auto select switch A-4 on. Auto select what? Auto select switch... Oh, my God! Good. Okay, all right. I have it. Auto select switch A-4 on. Gotcha. You're terrific. - Okay? - Okay, sure, sure. But what do I do? Be sure you stay in touch with base, or we may never find the starship. What? Hello, space shuttle, this Houston Control. Wait a minute, this is supposed to be a vacation! Mr. Thurlow, if you copy, please reply. - Oh. - Hello, space shuttle. Hello, Houston, Houston. - Please, switch to alternate channel three-niner. - Houston this me! - Ron! Ron! - Hello, space suttle, - we are not receiving you. - Hello! Hello, anybody. Anybody? Oh, Jesus. All hatches have been secured. This is Houston Control. All systems are in a go status. We are at T-minus 30 and counting. This is so real. I've changed my mind. I want to go to Medieval World. Now, Mrs Reed, nothing can go wrong. - This is Houston Control. - It's only a simulation. - We are in final launch sequence - I know. - at T-minus 15 and counting. - I know. Program the blast-off sequence. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. We have ignition. Increase passenger vibration red-line six. We are at maximum RFs and Gs. Bring the load simulator on the line at 1425. Prepare weightless simulation to begin on my mark. We have been notified by Robot Center that Mr. Mubutu... We will begin the Waters of Youth sequence on my mark. 3, 2, 1, mark. Prepare the illusion of Youth sequence for General and Mrs. Karnovski. When their hypnotic state has been achieved, please bring their carriage to exit 5 Denver, and activate all servants at the palace. General and Mrs. Karnovski will dine in their living quarters this evening. At the General's request, the Czar will give a ball in their honor at 2130 hours. Notify Robot Center that repairs on Czarina model 614 must be completed by 1900 hours. Prepare the Saxon Knight sequence to begin on my mark. Who authorized the camera? No one, sir, they were told not to bring them. Well, don't make any issue of it, but program the queen to steal it from him. Yes, sir. Begin the Saxon Knight sequence on my mark. 3, 2, 1, mark. I smell a heathen pig! No doubt, sir, you smell yourself! Notify Robot Center that the Saxon Knight has been terminated by Mr. Takaguchi. Everything all right? Yes, I think so. You spend too much time here. Well, these people are important. I don't want anything to go wrong. Nothing can go wrong. We are at T-minus 30 and... Begin preliminary cosmetic studies. Have the subject's full face on grid 1. Profile on grid 2. Preparing thermal read-outs on grid 3. Skin and hair on grid 4. Prosthetics monitoring all grids. Subject's face, class R, type 2. The baseline studies on subject beta-niner are now complete. Begin cosmetic studies on SR0074 and SR0073 now. Subject's eyes and macular apparatus on grid 8. 24mm sphere, checking cornea. Call Master Control. Inform Mr. Duffy that I will be in Robot Repair area 5. Close your fist, please. Good. We have the Roman Dancers on grid 9-5. Reception reports that all Futureworld guests are now on board the starship. Spacewalkers may use docking hatch 4 in the Space Safari Lodge. Your attention, please. The Martian Ski Shuttle is now ready for departure at docking Hatch 6. - Mr. Thurlow. - Yeah, yes. - We're ready to go now. - Oh, right. I'll be right with you. Now, listen, I'll see you all later, okay? Hey, I'm going to go skiing now. What do you think of that? - Bye, Ron. - Oh, wow. - See you later. - You bet. All right, all right. My knight to your pawn. My castle to your knight. Man, lookie here. Hiya, hi there. Hey, ain't this something, man? Now, are there any other questions? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Are you sure we can't get hurt? 'Cause I got plans for tonight. There's really nothing to worry about. Skiing on Mars is not that different than on Earth. Of course, the snow is red. And gravity is one third. But your skis are designed for that purpose. Ladies and gentlemen, all guests are encouraged to request the host or hostess of their choice. Why can't you? Because I'm too old for you. I'd feel like a fool. Not at all. You must remember that I've been programmed for your pleasure. In my eyes, you are very beautiful. Hey, we've got to try this thing. Put your quarter on the table, honey. We'll get to that one. I'll be there in a second. Yes, sir. May I get you something? You have pretty good memory banks? I'm a 500, sir. - We have quite excellent memories. - Good. You ever seen that fellow before? No, sir. Is he a guest? I guess you'd call him inoperative. Thanks. Now, are you sure that they are robots? - They're not ging to get hurt or anything, are they? - Positive. Just pick up the gloves, honey. Okay. - Ready? - Yep. - Chuck? - Yeah? I forgive you everything. Did you see that? Did you see that left? Pow! Terrific. I'm afraid I interrupted. Bu I think now would be a good time for you to come backstage with me. All the worlds are at full function, and you do have limited time. - Good. - I forgot something. I'll be right back. Excuse me. Bartender? Yes, sir? That photo I showed you earlier, I forgot to get it back. Oh, no, sir. I gave you the picture back. No, you didn't. Oh, yes, sir. - You're a liar. - No, sir. I'm not programmed to lie. Well, for a man without a program, you do a pretty damn good job! Something wrong? No. No, I must've made a mistake. Well, to err is human. That must be it. But it's all right. I have another one. Your attention, please. The first space safari to the caves of Venus is available for sign up at the tour desk. Mr. Duffy, you know, I wanted to ask you about those chessmen. Are they real, or what are they? No, they're holograms. Optical illusions. Everything in Futureworld is perfectly safe. We don't use this very often, so... watch your step, huh? It's hard to belive we never left the ground. I was convinced that we were really in orbit. I thought the queen stole that camera. She did. Apparently, he stole it back. The Takaguchi horse and lance are now programmed for combat with a plus 10 probability of victory on the first pass. Begin the joust sequence on my mark. 3, 2, 1, mark. Guests always win? We try to make it believable for them, of course. But the guests are always the victors. Mind if we look around? No, go right ahead. Please, mark this robot for pick-up and repair. Notify Robor Center that all vital signs were terminated... You just relax and enjoy yourself. Take this all in. Come here a second. - Where are we going? - Just come here. - I want you to do me a favor. - What? I want you to pick out one of these guys and turn him on. Why would you want me to do that? - Just trust me. - Why should I trust you? Just trust me for once, will you Socks? Pick out one of these guys and do a number on him and get him interested, you know? What is your game? It's no game, believe me. Oh, you do remember how to get someone interested? Do I remember how to get someone interested? Okay, which one? Piece of cake. Hey, you really know what you're doing. I've been watching you. I'm Tracy Ballard. How do you do? Hi, what's your name? Steven. Steven, I'm doing a video special on Delos, and, God, it's so confusing, you know? I thought maybe later on we could get together. You could sort of help me out. I'm sorry, that's not possible. Ah, you're married, huh? No, ma'am. Well. Gee, this is a wonderful job, but don't you kind of get... a little lonely, Steven? No, ma'am. You're not making this easy, Steven. Tell me, do you think I'm pretty? Yes, ma'am. Well, I'm awfully lonely here. Steven, I... I'd like it-- I'm sorry, ma'am. All right, begin the spacewalk sequence on my mark. Bring the moon up a little fuller, please. 3, 2, 1, mark. I think you better try him yourself. I don't think he likes girls. Yeah, then come on. What are we trying to prove? Just come on. Give me a quantum 9. - Hey, Duffy. - You seen enough? Enough to know that I'm getting the fast shuffle. What are you talking about? Well, in my business we call it managed news. Such as? Such as what's wrong with all the people in this room? I mean, are they drugged or hypnotized or what? Because they sure as hell aren't normal. They're normal for robots. All these people are machines? That's impossible! Seems I'm to blame for not explaining. You see, we discovered that one of the causes for our disaster with Westworld lay with the human flaws of our controllers. So we replaced them with these. The model 700 technician series. They have no ego. So, they have no hang-ups. And thus, one more source of error is eliminated. They're all robots. I feel very badly. I was sure that Dr. Schneider had told you. Prepare the Martian ski sequence for five guests. And return power to grid 3. I'll tell you something, mister. That is the last time you get me to flyspeck Delos. And if you don't stop acting like such a paranoid idiot, I hope Duffy throws you out of here. Well, why didn't he tell us? I mean, why did he wait? He forgot. Isn't that a perfectly normal human thing to do? If you weren't so eager to do a hatchet job, you wouldn't think twice about it. I thought you should see what's left of Westworld. I don't want to be accused of trying to hide anything. Oh, now Mr. Duffy, I hope you understand I don't think you're trying to hide anything. I think that Delos is wonderful and I'm sure that's how the story's going to come out. That's very gratifying. Gratifying, yes. Well, I'd like to have a look around by myself. If you don't have any objections? - Not at all. - Hmm. Interesting fellow. - Certainly has a suspicious mind. - Oh, yes. He thinks it's admirable. Chuck? Chuck, where are you? Chuck? Chuck? Can I give you a hand? You brat! I should've known better than to worry about you. Tracy. Damn! I just... can't decide. Then don't. Take us both. I don't think that would work out. Why not? We're both sex models. Yeah, that's okay for you, but... I mean... I mean, what the hell, I'm no Superman. You'd be surprised. Well, I'll leave you to yourselves. Dinner should be along shortly. Better get plenty of rest. Got a big day head of us. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. Socks. Aw, come on, Socks, it was only a joke. My bed is upstairs, yours is downstairs. Let's make damn sure we keep it that way. Monitoring diarthrosis objevis. Hyaline and synovial read-outs recorded. Status. We're completing the gross body series. We'll start molecular studies in one hour. All right, did you alter their food? Yes, sir, we should have 4 to 6 hours. I want all thermal x-ray and electrochemical studies finished by tonight. - That's not much time. - It'll have to do. Our Mr. Browning is getting much too curious. I have a holograph in my screen. Restructuring. Read-out normal. Security reports that drugs were added to the food intake of all four subjects. The subjects are now asleep and available for pick-up at 2100 hours. All subjects should be returned to their rooms by 0230. Begin all graphic studies on my mark. 3, 2, 1, mark. I am reading the cytoplasmic structure now. I want the chemical read-outs, as soon as you've got them. Affirmative. Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen readings are up. Camino cytonic channels, hyperbilia, mitochondria, endoplasmic readings are recording. Magnesium count. 1.7, sir. Hematology, red cell mass, 2.0 liters. Hematocrit, 0.44. This is a time warning to all personnel. It is now 0210. All tests must be completed by 0215. All subjects must be returned to their sleeping quarters by 0230. Chuck! - Chuck! Chuck! - What's the matter? Oh, I had this awful deram. It was horrible. I was in the hospital and these peopple kept hurting me. And kept hurting me, and I couldn't do anything. It's all right now, it's over. Come and sit down. Here you go, sit down. I'm sorry, I feel like an idiot. But... it was so real. It's no problem. No problem at all. What are you doing dressed? Well, to tell the truth, I was on my way to take a little unauthorized tour. Oh, no, you can't do that. That could be dangerous. Socks, I don't know if I've got a real story here or not. But I'm not going to find out following Duffy around, you know? If you're going, I'm going. - Wrong. No, you're not. - Yes, I am. Just because I get mad at you doesn't mean I want to see you get hurt. You stay here. The minute you walk out that door, I'm going to call Duffy. Oh, you wouldn't do that. Try me. You are the most stubborn woman I have ever met. All right, hurry up, go up and change. But don't take all night! Where are we going? Power plant. What is that, anyway? Looks like a road map to all the tunnel systems. Well, is that good? - That's bingo, Socks. - Oh. Come on, lets go. It's a 400. It's programmed not to stop us. - Are you sure? - No! That's it. That's the entrance to the tunnels. Yep, come on. Are you sure you know where you're going? - Not entirely. - Oh, terrific. Okay. Where are we? Right beneath the Research and Development area. If they're keeping any secrets, this is where they ought to be. Oh, boy. Oh, yes. Duffy said they were building an Eastworld. Duffy said a lot of things. Come on. What are you looking for anyway? How the hell do I know? I think we ought to get out of here. Damn it, we just got here. Just... We got to get some light in here. Hmm. Hey, you don't know what you're doing. Don't bother me. I got an insinct for these things. Turn it off. Will you turn it off? Maybe they work in a combination. How impressive. Oh, for God's sake, let's get out of here. You know this is about as exciting as a visit to the waterworks. Oh, lighten up, Socks. Determination is a mark of a good reporter. Chuck! Come on! Down! - Go! - Chuck! Up, up! Chuck! Get out of here! I can't hold it. Let's go for the other chamber. Come on! Find something to jam the wheel. - Where shall I put it? - Here, here. Brace it on the table. Let's get out of here. What happened? I don't know. What the hell are you doing in there, anyway? Come on out of there. Is it safe? You haven't died and gone to heaven, have you? Yeah, it's safe. You can ckick them in the butt, they won't do nothing. Come on! Listen, I don't know how we can thak you. Just hurry up. We'll do fine. Ther'll be a whole damn army of iron here in a minute. - Come on. - Oh, my God. Check the white chamber. You come with me. Okay, we're safe now. They won't search down here? No, no. No iron ever comes down here. It's too wet for them. Screws up their circuits. We had a fire once, the sprinklers went off. You should've seen them robots. They were standing around like a bunch of drunks. There's the power plant right up there. You can go back the way you got here. Listen, I would really like to talk to you. I got nothing to say. Well, we're reporters, see. Yeah, I know who you are. I've been watching you. Well, what's your name? Harry Croft. Well, Mr. Croft, you're just the kind of man we've been looking for. Someone who knows their way around this place and is not afraid to talk about it. Now, wait a minute, I did you a favor, because I don't like to see anybody get into trouble. But I got nothing to talk about. Well, do you know who Miss Ballard is, Mr. Croft? She's a reporter, right? Oh, hell, she's much more than a reporter. She's a top television commentator. She has her own show with 55 million viewers worldwide. Now, she wants to inerview you for her program, right? Yes, yes, I do. What, me? Well... I was here since the opening. The first one, way, way back. And I've seen it all. That's it. Harry Croft, the man behind the iron mask at Delos. - Yes. - Would they see this in Cleveland? They certainly will. My mother's in Cleveland. Hell, man, your mother's going to be proud of you. I don't know. All right. Nobody here, sir. All right, come with me. I got a room up top, but... me and Clark, we like our little corner here best of all. Ths is Clark. Clark! Well, hello, Clark. He's an old 400 series I saved from the junkyard. You want some coffee? Booze? Coffee would be wonderful. What kind of booze do you have? Any kind you want, long as it's gin. Terrific. Come on, sit down, make yourselves comfortable. - Okay. - Give me a coffee and a couple of gins. And don't forget the ice. You got to stay on top of him. He gets a little sloppy sometimes. Why do you call him Clark? You know, from Superman, Clark Kent, man of steel. Is this his face? Yeah... I kind of got tired of taking it off every time I had to fix him. He don't mind. Oh, it's a sad face. Well, he used to work at the Roman World. He was one of the original iron men in all the orgies. He's seen a lot, Clark has. It's wonder he can still move at all. Thank you, Clark. Yeah, well, I imagine you've seen some things yourself, Harry. Well, you know. You... develop a taste for the iron after a while. It's good. I remember one night. Frenchy and I had a couple of girls up here from the Westworld. ooh-wee, we blew a few fuses that night, I'll tell you. You said Frenchy. Yeah, it's a guy that used to work here. Why? Do you know Frenchy? May I ask what you are doing here at this time of night? Hi, there. Yes, we couldn't sleep, wandered around, and found ourselves here. Not very likely. Are you calling the lady a liar? Oh, for heaven's sakes. Harry was just telling us about the good old days. He would have done better to remember that we do not encourage contact between our employees and our guests. We're not your guests. We're reporters. You invited us here, remember? So, you can save that line of crap for your robots, mister. And Dr. Schneider, if we're not allowed to interview anybody we want, then I think that we just better leave Delos right now. You can talk to anyone you wish. I merely request that you inform Mr. Duffy and not sneak around at 3 o'clock in the morning. Surely, that's not too much to ask. Listen, I was just leaving anyway. No, that's all right, Harry. It's late. And I think that we're the ones that ought to be going. If you follow me, I'll see you to your rooms. - Chuck? - Right. Thanks, Harry, We'll see you. Yeah, okay. Clark, give me another gin. What'd I tell you? It never changes. You get mixed up with people, all you got's trouble. Good night. Thanks for everything, Doc. It's been a swell evening. Mister, if this was your idea of a swell evening, you have got the wrong girl. No, I don't, and one of these days you're going to be a hell of a reporter. - What did I do? - Come with me. - I thought you'd never ask. - Come on. Harry spoke of a Frenchy, remember? Yeah. Well, this guy called Frenchy got himself killed trying to tell me about Delos. Now, I never got the story. But he was carrying these clippings about heavyweight people from every country on Earth. You know, bankers and commissars, you name it. I don't get the connection. Well, I checked. And each one of them was a guest at Delos. Now, I smell a big rat. But I want to talk to Harry alone and I'm going to need your help, Socks. Oh, listen I don't know. I mean, we keep breaking their rules, they're never going to let me back with a video crew. Anyway, we promised that we would be fair. Okay, you help me tomorrow. and if I don't get something solid from Harry, then I'll lay off, all right? Okay, okay. Hey, you were pretty terrific tonight, do you know that? Oh, you weren't too shabby yoursef. I bet you say that to all your copy boys. - Mm-mm. - Mm-mm. I don't. Shuttle 10-4-3 is clear to proceed to Mars... Please, expedite repair of the fountain. 4-2-7, do you copy? We can see the fountain, and it is not functioning in its proper mode. Do you copy? 4-2-7, please respond. Yes, I copy, you miseralbe bag of bolts! If you think you can do any better, get your iron butt down here, otherwise, shut up! 4-2-7, out. We call it our Inner Space Chamber and we hope to make it a regular part of Futureworld. The idea is to actually make a videotape of a dream. You take it with you, play it back, find out what you're thinking about. That is absolutely incredible. - You want to try it? - Go ahead, Socks, go for it. Well, yes, yes, I do, you know. Maybe I could use it on the program. I think you'll find this a unique experience. - Chuck, would you just wait here? - You bet. I gotta see this. Wait a minute, you mean he can watch? Unless you object. Well, I don't know whether I do or not. I mean, it depends on what I dream, doesn't it? Well, don't you worry about it. I won't tell anybody. All right, wise guy. It's about time you learned something about women. - This way. - Hmm. Are you sure I won't have a nightmare? I mean, this thing looks pretty frightening. Well, we'll see to it that that doesn't happen. The couch is designed to remove any pressure along the neural spinal column. And the material bleeds air at the exact tempreature of your body. So, you'll see nothing, feel nothing, hear nothing. Your mind will begin to feed on itself. With my luck, I won't be able to fall asleep. Bye. Every thought, like every eye blink or a heartbeat releases currents of electricity, which can be transformed into waves. She's got a lot on her mind, huh? Well, we're recording 2,000 different waves from 5,000 separate brain locations. - Wow. - Millions of bits of information. We take it all in... and put it back together. On this. - What's this? - Take a look. You know what you're seeing? I can't believe it. Well, it's true. You're looking directly into her mind. We've learned how to convert thought waves back into the images the mind creates. It isn't perfect, of course. It'll do. Wow. Activate the pain-pleasure gradient, please. Who's that? - Reference? - A fantasy lover. I'm not sure I'm ready for this. Start a video recording on my mark. 3, 2, 1, mark. We're losing it. She's waking up. Better give her a moment. Real life is a shock after that. Yeah, I'll bet. I call. What'd you got? I said I'll call. Damn it, show me your cards! I'll be go to hell. All right, what'd you got? Four kings, huh? I find out you been cheating, I'm gonna fry your wires. All rght, it's my deal. Five cards stud. Jokers with aces, straights, and flushes. Fool around, cheat this time. All right, ante up! All right, you just stay away, mister. I'm in all the trouble I need because of you. Is that Frenchy? My God, what happened to him? Somebody killed him. I don't know why they'd want to do that. He never hurt anybody. What was his job? He's a workman, same as I am. He had a run-in with Dr. Schneider and he quit. Or else he got fired, I don't know. He talked to me just before he was killed. He said he had the big story about Delos. Do you know what he was talking about? - Do you? - Maybe. Well, what? Do you think they'll treat you any better? Hmm? I'm probably going to lose my job, because of this. But I don't look like I got much of a future anyway. Come on. I got something to show you. Don't you touch them cards. You know there used to be a couple dozen maintenance men. In each world. Now it's all machines except for me and a couple other guys. Everything changed after they brought out the 700s. Changed how? They're just different, that's all. They think too much. They don't think for themselves, do they? No, no, they're iron just like the rest of them. They don't go anywhere, do anything they're not programmed to. - But... - But they got you worried, huh? - This is it. - All right. What is it? Used to be dead inventory. I don't know what it is now. I know one thing. That's the only door in Delos I can't get in. The only ones allowed in there are the 700s. What's that? Write down what I tell you. 7, 4, 3, 1, 6. 7, 4, 3, 1, 6. Let's try it. Yeah, I've tried it a dozen times. I can't get in thoose doors. Hell, one more time, Harry. - Come on. - Okay. Give me those numbers. 7, 4, 3, 1, 6. I told you. - You...? - No, I don't smoke. I tried that code every way I could. I can't get in, just can't get in. Well, maybe it's not the code, you know? Maybe it's something else, something personal. What do you mean? Fingerprints or voice, you know? 700s haven't got no fingerprints. Only way you can tell the difference between them is in their eyes. That's it! Goddamn it, that's it! Their eyes. That light reads the circuitry in their eyes. Come on! Well, I hope you'll accept my apologies for Chuck's behavior. I think he's just overtrained for a simple story like Delos. Well, we're not worried. I'm sure he'll turn up sooner or later. You know, I find that man, Harry, an interesting character. I definitely want to use him on the show. - Harry's one of our old boys. - Ah. Mr. Duffy feels sorry for him, but frankly, I think he should have been phased out long ago. Well, why's that? His skills are no longer needed. Our 700s can do it better. Oh, Mort, that's not entirely true. We haven't solved the problem of wet areas. Harry is still quite valuable. Well, anyway, don't you think it's dangerous to rely too much on the robots? Don't you think something could go wrong again? Not at all. Hey, iron ass! Are you running correlates on organic emissions? I have the resonance frequency on the protein molecules. Electromagnetic shaping positive. Subject beta-niner. Energy matrix play out is particulating... now. It's all right. Do you know what it is? Wasn't here before. It's Karnovski. Chuck, isn't that...? It's Takaguchi. Oh, my God, I don't beleive it. - They're duplicates. - What? They are creating and programming duplicates of real people. That's what Frenchy's list meant about the politicians and the commissars and the generals. They've all been replaced by those things. You'll start the family history program on my mark. 3, 2, 1, mark. Let us repeat our social attitude program, please. And add a factor of 5 to the medulla circuit. You will never harm Delos. I will never harm Delos. You will do what Delos instructs you to do. I will do whatever Delos instructs me to do. You will destroy your original. I will destroy my original. There's a plane leaving in about 3 hours. We should get back to our rooms, get our stuff together, and get on that flight. - Yeah, but what about Duffy? - We'll call him from the airport. - You know your way back from here? - You bet. I wouldn't stay in that room too long. I don't beleve it's safe. I'll meet you at the power plant in half an hour. I know a place we can hide until the plane leaves. Okay, but if we don't show, you get out best way you can. - Good luck. - Okay, come on, let's go. I'll just be a minute. All right, I'll try to get Holcombe, tell him what happened. Operator, I want to make a person-to-person call to Arthur Holcombe, International Media Corporation. Right, 7-2-5, 4-5-7, 8-8-6-9-6. Yeah, sure, I'll wait. Put the phone down, Chuck. You're a part of it? Yes, of couse, I am. Now, where is Miss Ballard? She's with Harry. They're supposed to meet me here. Well, I suppose it's possible that ocasionally even a newspaper reporter tells the truth. We'll just go upstairs and check, shall we? Why are you doing this? Oh, that should be obvious. If you read your own newspaper more carefully, you'd understand our position quite easily. The human being is a very unstable, irrational, violent animal. Now, hold it. All our probability studies indicate that if left alone, you'll destroy much of this planet before the end of the decade. Now, we at Delos are determined to seeing that doesn't happen. We don't intend to be destroyed by your mistakes. So, you're replacing human leaders with your own duplicates, huh? Yes. With duplicates who are programmed to think first of the welfare of Delos and to accept our instructions. Downstairs. Why bother with Tracy or me? Because we need the favorable publicity to attract the top rank of human leadership. The stories your duplicates create will guarantee that every Chief of State will soon be among our guests. You can't possibly succeed. We can and we will. Look, don't imagine that these duplicates we've created are mere robots. They are not machines. They are living beings produced by the genetic information in your own cells. There are no mechanical parts. Even those of us who create them can't tell the original from the duplicate. Jesus! Shoot him! Shoot him! I can't hold him! Now! What are you doing? He was much too strong. What do we do now? Well, we can't stay here. What about Westworld? That was deserted. Yeah, good idea. You know I'd take you with me, don't you? You know that. It just... It wouldn't work out. I mean, people on the outside, they just... they never would understand how it is with us. The hell with them. When we get this thing straightened out, I'll be back to get you. Don't worry about that. Don't worry about it. You been a good pal to me. I'm gonna sure miss you. Watch out for the bad circuit in your arm, you hear? You got to be careful now. So long, you ol' bag of bolts. We'll see you. Okay. You wait by the barn. I'm going to get Harry and be right back. Okay, look. - You be careful. - You bet. - Go on. - Yeah. - Hi. - Where is Tracy? - She's safe. - Great, let's go. Don't hurry, Chuck. I'll find you. Chuck? Chuck? Hello, Tracy. Why! Well, you... You can't be. But I am. What are you? You. Don't run there. You were going to run to the saloon and hide in the gap between the floorboard and the ground. How can... How can you know that? Because I have your mind. And what you think, I think and what you know, I know. And now it's too late to run, because we're both within accurate range of these guns. Yes, I... Yes, I just... I just thought of that. Yes, I know you did. It's a good thing Father taught us how to shoot, isn't it? Yes. Maybe we shouldn't have worried so much about whether he loved us or not. No... He was just busy, I guess. Yes. Well, it's been good to meet you. But of course... there can only be one of us. - Yes. - And since... since you can read my mind. I can read yours. Yes. Hey, Chuck? Chuck, this isn't going to get us anywhere, you know? We're both lousy shots. Remember Sergeant Rucker at basic? Browning, you couldn't hit an elephant in the ass at 5 yards with a bazooka. Be careful, brother. Don't forget we're afraid of heights. Oh, good. Damn good, really. Well, Chuck, it's been fun. But I've got a plane to catch and a story to write. You know what I mean? Anyway, don't feel too bad. You're not going to die, exactly. Just going to be replaced. I thought I'd see you off personally. Thank you. It's just been a fabulous time, really. I look forward to coming back with a video crew next week. Really, it was just a wonderful time. And I hope you'll thank Mr. Duffy for us. I certainly will. What about you, Chuck? Have we satisfied your suspicions? I'd like to apologize for that. But I think your patience with me will be rewarded. I intend to write a story that will make everyone who can afford it, a Delos customer. Your attention, please. - That's wonderful. - Laker Airways anounces the departure of flight 936 for New York - Wonderful. - and San Fransico. This is the final call for... Oh, that's us. - Let's go. - So long, Doc. All aboard, please. They are the... the wrong ones. Did you talk to Arthur? Yeah, told him the whole story. It'll be old news by the time we get home. Hey, you know, I still don't think that kissing you was a very scientific way of finding out who was who. Well, there are some things you just can't fake, Socks.
