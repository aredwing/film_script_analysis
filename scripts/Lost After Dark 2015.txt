I know, it's like fate or something. Tobe, you scared me to death. Sorry, are you ready to go? My dad's taking me. It's three blocks away. I'll see you at school. Yeah, that was Tobe outside. He's such a sweetheart. I'm so glad he's gonna be there. I can't believe we're doing this. My dad would kill me if he found out. Hang on. Um... hold on. Okay, come in. Hey, kiddo. Got a sec? Um, yeah. Hey, I gotta go, Jamie. Yeah, I'll see you at school. Okay, bye. That's a lot of clothes for one weekend. It's my first sleepover. I figure better safe than sorry, right? I haven't seen you this excited in a long time. I'm just nervous, I guess. I don't have to go. I can call Jamie back right now. No. We gotta stop burning that candle. Laurie is cut from the same cloth as your mother. "Born to wander," your grandfather used to say. And I knew that as soon as she fell for these long-haired free-loving types, she already had one foot out the door. Now, if she comes home, great. It'll be open arms and Thanksgiving dinners. But you gotta worry about you, too. So you're going to this dance, and you're gonna go spend the weekend with Jamie like you planned. But you'll be all alone. Don't you worry about me. This weekend, just be 17, okay? Okay. All right. Did you come in here just to give me a pep talk? Pretty much. I'll see you downstairs. Reject, reject Reject, reject Goddamn vandal. You may not respect authority, son, but while you're on my campus, you will respect the institution placed here by the good people of Michigan. Let's go find the janitor. You look beautiful. You're just saying that because you're my dad. No, I'm saying that 'cause it's the truth. Now get out of the car. I will be home Sunday before "60 Minutes." Yeah, get out of here. Jamie. Look at that dress. You look amazing. Shut up, you do. I've never done this before. Sneaking out? Lying to my dad? Ever since Laurie left, I... Nuh. We are not telling sad stories this weekend. Happy thoughts. Right. Happy thoughts. Sean and Adrienne sitting in a tree. - K-I-S-S... - Stop! We just flirted. He probably does it with everyone. Not this weekend, he doesn't. - I gotta go grab my bag. - Okay, I'll meet you outside. I'm gonna get you laid. Okay, coast is clear. Man, I cannot believe I let y'all talk me into this. What else were you gonna be doing this weekend? Wasn't gonna be committing a felony, I know that. What do you think, Tobe? I'm you're asking me if I can get it started, the answer's hell, yeah! All right, dude. Come on. One, two, three. Go. Go! Get your big ass in there, man. Quit shoving, all right? Hey, man, it's all fun and games until someone loses an eye, all right? Grab the bags. Don't you walk away from me, young lady! I didn't do anything! Maybe not yet, but you shouldn't be hanging around with those boys. And that outfit is unacceptable. What are you doing out here? The dance is inside. What's the matter with what I'm wearing? Gotta get with the times, Mr. C. This isn't the same world your parents grew up in. You carry mace? A.B.P., that's my motto. Always be prepared. When I was in the bush with the 101st, you can sure bet, little missie, that we were prepared for anything. 'Cause that was back in the day when men were men and women knew it. Don't look at me with those big dumb cow eyes. Get right in there. Get right in there. - All right. How's that? - Good. Hey, man, I thought you said you could start this thing. I built a working ham radio when I was 10. I think I can start a bus. I don't see how those two things are related at all. Hey, man, if you get this thing started, I'll even talk to Marilyn for you. I've talked to Marilyn a million times, okay? Homeboy, I'm talking about talking, all right? The kind you do without words? Hot, wet, filthy conversation. Shut up and let me work, okay? Come on. Come on. Yes! - That's what I'm talking about! - All right, here we go. - Whoo! - Buckle up! She's wearing what? Speak of the slut, and she will appear. Seen Johnnie? Not yet. The boys should be here any minute, though. Maybe he's with Sean. That's a cute dress. It almost looks like you have boobs. Thanks. Is she for real? She's clueless. You seen Marilyn? Marilyn will be here in a minute. She got cornered by Mr. C. Did you hear that? - Hear what? - I just want to see what it is. Psych! You should have seen your stupid faces. - Real nice, Johnnie. - Hi, baby. - All right. Wheels. - No way. Come on, Jamie. All right, whoo! Whoo! Boom! He got us a ride. - Not bad. - As if. Adrienne, your chariot awaits, my lady. Whoa, hold on. You did bring the key, right, scholarship? And you made arrangements? No overprotective daddy is gonna come looking for us, right? Yeah, it's all set. You just made the cool kids' table. So you ready to break some rules? Sure, I... I mean, yeah. Let's break some rules. Who's missing? Guys, I'm here! Okay, let's get out of here before Mr. C. realizes we're not inside. Getting all Big Brother in there. - Hey, Marilyn. - Hey, man. Something wrong? What if someone notices the bus is missing? Johnnie's dad practically owns this town, okay? Nobody's gonna press charges. Hey, would I let anything happen to you? No. That's my girl. Come on. Goddamn turds went AWOL. They don't know who they're messing with. All right, campers. It is officially time to party hearty! Beer! My... house. Though I'm not aging Like shadows on the wall I know I thought I could be in love Just slip your hands inside my glove And we will see if we feel different When I'm not there I want to care... Yo, check this out. Come on. Play. What happened to the music? Yeah. Party people in the place across the globe We got a little story that must be told About the sucker MC that took our rhymes It sounded real good, but it's just like mine He liked to brag, and he liked to boast And all the little girlies thought he had the most Working real hard, thinking that he God So open up your ears and listen close The style that you need is my style, indeed You're deck is steady frontin' But you sure take heat 'Cause the suckers on the front And biters on the side Ain't nowhere to run, ain't nowhere to hide Manny Lear was my boy from way back when Brotha stole my bike when I was ten I shoulda know better, I shoulda known then... What do you think we'll endure... Hey, man, how much longer, you think? Based on the direction Adrienne gave us, I'd say about another hour. It's hard to tell. It's not like they littered this road with signs. Shit! What you mean? We are so screwed. Fuck. Yep. Dry as a bone. It's a gas thing. The engine looks fine. We're out of gas? You mean to tell me we're stuck out here, Tobe? Wes! Wes, hey, it's fine, man. We're gonna be okay. Don't look at me, okay? The gauge says half full. You guys picked the broken bus. I just started it. Hey, guys? Where are the girls? Sean is so into you. Told you I was gonna get you laid. I don't know, maybe. I mean, I don't really know how to kiss, let alone, you know. You don't know what you're missing out on. - Don't be silly, it's easy. - And rad. - Here, I'll show you. - No! Do it. Then when Sean kisses you, it won't be weird. It's weird now. Jamie's not afraid to do it. Are you, Jamie? Watch and learn. Just close your eyes. Open your mouth, but just a bit. Then you tilt your head and wait for it. See? Easy. You guys are crazy. My God! Ha ha! - Johnnie, you scumbag! - Nice tits! Get a life, will you? You don't think he saw anything, do you? Why would he do that? Because it's Johnnie. Man, I saw the girls changing. I scared the shit out of them. Got to love the classics. You dickheads get this thing rolling yet? Can't go anywhere until we find some gas. Well, that's Tobe's department, right? You broke the bus, you fix the bus. Come on, dude. Much better. Those heels were killing me. Man, I got a mosquito bite on my ass. You look great. Thanks. How very. Hey, Sean, get in the game. What are we doing? How far away are we from your cabin? I don't know. I guess they'll give anyone a scholarship? Get bent, Johnnie. Look, maybe we can send somebody down the road and see if there's anything nearby. Yeah, good idea. Hey, thanks for volunteering. What? Why me? Don't you know? The driver's always responsible for the passenger, Tobe. Unless you're too much of a pussy to go. This is so bogus. All by myself? I'll go. Really? Hey, there you go. Hit the road, loser. Gimme the flashlight. May the Force be with you, pal. Find help, I will. Man, we are gonna be here the whole night. Why is everybody being so paranoid? There are houses everywhere. This is America, okay? Tubby will find a phone and a rack of ribs and be back in a flash. You know, maybe we can get all the bags out and see what we got all the same. What? Nothing. Just thought I heard something. Why do you think Marilyn went with lard-ass anyway? Really? It's 'cause Tobe has all the weed. So... got any weed? You know it. - Sorry. - Lightweight. No, I mean I'm sorry I got us into all this. Tobe, chill. Shit happens. It's fate. What? Fate, you know, like, the way things are supposed to go down. I believe everything happens for a reason, even if we don't know what it is. Like us talking right now. I mean, if hadn't decided to go to the cabin for the weekend, or if we hadn't picked that particular bus with the broken gauge, or if we hadn't run out of gas on that particular road, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. You know, I'm really happy we have Sociology together. One class, our last year and all. Me, too. Remember that time Miss Williams handed us those worksheets and when she handed you yours she asked you what was wrong 'cause your eyes were so red? - Yeah. - And you said you were way too high to be doing a worksheet. That was hilarious. And she said something else, but I didn't hear. She said... she told me to put my head down and not talk to anybody for the rest of the class. I think she thought it was contagious. That was the first time I knew you were cool. Cool like I smoke grass? No. You know... a cool guy. Really? Absolutely. Okay. Box of Bugles, box of Pop Tarts, and some gum. That's it? Can we stop worrying and start drinking again? The beer's getting warmer by the minute. Hey, Heather, you got anything to eat in the big-ass bag of yours? - Nothing. - Nothing? Not even some Twinkies or something? You see, Heather here, she's a Twinkie junkie. Shut up! Am not. Let me see. No, I just have personal items. You know, girl things. Great, let me see. Johnnie, no! What the fuck? Precious, are you okay? I can't believe it. You brought your rat-fucking dog? I knew you wouldn't let me bring her if I told you. Look, the dog's here now, okay, Johnnie? You know what? Scholarship here is right. There's nothing we can do now. Eat it, maybe. And you wonder why she hates you. It's okay, baby. I won't let the bad man hurt you. What about you, Johnnie? Do cigarettes count? How many calories are in a cigarette? Look, I bet Tobe and Marilyn already found help and are on their way back. Got another joint? Madame? Merci. This bud is gnarly. The gnarliest. How far do you think we've gone? Who cares? We're on vacation. Yeah, life's a beach. - What are you doing? - He's ticklish! No, okay, no. You can run, but you can't hide! Damn it. What was that? Cool. "Joad." It's a house. Let's go tell everyone. Whoa, whoa, wait. I mean, who knows who could live there? I mean, look at that place. No one lives there. It's a dump. Kind of spooky? I think we've gone past spooky and straight to freaky. Come on, let's go tell the others. Come on. Hey, don't make me tickle you again. Okay, no, you stay right over there. I'm coming after you! All right already! Hold your horses! Vice principal Frank Cunningham. We have a serious situation on our hands. Now's your chance, bro. Hey. Everything okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Yeah? You just seem quiet back here. I'm sorry. What's wrong? - Be honest with me. - Okay. If my dad didn't have this hunting cabin, would you guys have wanted me along? Adrienne, look... Sean, if I hadn't been your tutor and told you about the cabin, would I even be here? Look, Adrienne... I think you're beautiful. Okay, the cabin was just some excuse to spend time with you. Really? Beautiful? Yeah. Thought so ever since we had homeroom together. I mean, it's like you got this whole other gear. First you're in the semis. Couldn't nobody touch you. And then you sprain your ankle and still ran in the finals? That's bad-ass, girl. It's a breathing thing. I mean, the pain just kind of fades away if you focus on your breath. Yeah. I tell you what I've been focusing on. Here it comes. No, come on. Look, don't be so quick to judge. I was just gonna say that maybe you and I could find some time to ourselves once we get into the cabin. - Me and you. - Yeah, why not? Word gets around, Wes. Rumor is you're a little bit of a dog. Aw, come on. That hurt. Really. Focus on the breathing. Hey, look. What is it? Someone's there. Where? I don't see anything. Outside. Listen. You hear that? Kill... kill the music. - Johnnie, I'm scar... - Quiet! - Sean. - Yeah. Come on. Aah! I think we found something. These eyes don't lie. She was on the bus with those miscreants. Well, let's get to the bottom of this right now. Hi, Rhona. This is Norman, Adrienne's father. Is everything okay? Why would Jamie be here? I didn't... I thought... Jamie was supposed to be sleeping over there this weekend. Never mind what I thought. I'll call you back. She'll be fine. What I don't know is where they might be going. I swear to you, Mr. Cunningham, she didn't tell me anything about this. I'm sure she did not. I don't understand. She usually makes such good choices. It's a shame that a student that shows as much promise as Adrienne would associate with these hooligans. Mr. Cunningham, she needs this school. It would be unfortunate if she did anything to jeopardize that. Could be disastrous for her future. I need some coffee. What do you say we Irish that up a little? Sounds good. I think I know where they went. What are the coordinates? You don't think anybody lives in this shithole, do you? Maybe a squatter or something. Who knows out here? Only way to find out. Hey, guys? I'm not too sure about this. You scared? Hello? Hello, anyone home? See? No problem. Baby, are you okay? - I'm fine. - Shut up! Fucking house is a death trap. Hello? Flashlight. This place is so grody. It's like "Better Hillbilly Homes and Gardens." I don't know. Some fresh curtains, new coat of paint, and it would be... really just awful. Electricity's out. Relax, okay? It's dead. Get it out of here! What do you think did that? A possum, maybe? My God, there are possums here? I think we can rule out the possum theory. I don't know, maybe just a drifter just passing through? Now you're Sherlock Holmes? Good one, baby. Either way, doesn't look like anyone's actually lived here in a long time. I mean, my guess is we're alone, but maybe we should stay in pairs, you know? This place is big. - Creepy, too. - Yeah. There. Okay. Let's see if there's anything we can scrounge up. I mean, phone's probably too much to ask, but maybe some candles or a flashlight? Let's split up and look around. Me and Heather will check the bedrooms. Perhaps you'll find Heather's lost virginity. You know I could literally crush you... right? Johnnie, easy. Okay, Wes, Jamie, see if you can salvage anything in those last two rooms. Adrienne, you and I will check the kitchen. What about me and Marilyn? Well, I mean, someone has to take a look in the barn, and you're the only one with the other flashlight. I think I saw I tractor on the way up. Maybe there's some gas up there. Sure. Yeah. Okay. I guess that's cool. Okay. All right. Let's go. How long do you think it's been since someone lived here? How should I know? Sorry, was just trying to make conversation. All right, you guys take left. We'll take right. Gross. I know, it's disgusting in here. Shit. Fuck. Come on. I saw you looking at her. What? Marilyn. The slut. Yeah, okay, I noticed her, babe. But... you're my girl. You know? Why are you always so mean to me? I don't know. But you're right. I'll try and be better. Come on. Jackpot. You saved the day. Watch your step. Holy shit. Look at this place. Must have been a slaughterhouse. Just when you think this place can't get anymore charming, boom, an abattoir. Abattoir? Slaughterhouse. So, other barn? Definitely. Other barn. Man, what do you think this is all about? I have no clue. Good thing I was here. Yeah. Just caught me off-guard, that's all. Let's get up out of here. Come on. Hey. That's what I'm talking about. Car equals gas. Bingo. And it's empty. But fear not. I have something for our dynamic duo. My hero. Do you want a cigarette? No, thanks. That stuff's poison. What have we got here? - Fancy. - Sweet. Like, I know... I know this isn't the time or place, but... I really like you. I like you, too. Yeah? That was nice. Yeah, it was. - What was that? - I don't know. Must have come from downstairs. Here. Presto. Well, it's very rustic. I don't like it. Can you please close it? Come on, there's nothing to be scared of. Here, look for yourself. It's okay. See? No boogeyman. Now that's shitty. Not exactly the vacation we had in mind. So I guess you're probably going off to college in the fall? Not sure yet. What about you? I'll probably just end up working for my dad. But, you know, if you don't go, it means we could, you know, hang out more. We hang out almost every weekend at the arcade. No, I know, we... we do, but it's, um... we're always with the gang, you know. It's never... it's never just us. I can't understand how someone who smokes as much weed as you do can have bad eyes. I mean, isn't this supposed to be good for you or something? Like carrots? I don't know. I guess. No, what I meant was, you know, maybe this weekend will give us a chance to spend some real time together, you know? Just you and me. - That'd be great. - Really? You think? Sure. I have to warn you, though, I may need some advice. About what? Well... okay. What do you think about Wesley? He's a cool guy, and, you kn... Wait, what about him? He's just so... I don't know. Exotic or something, you know? - Because he's black. - No, that's not it. Has he ever mentioned me? Actually, I think he likes Jamie. I could get him if I wanted. No, I mean... of course you could. I mean... you're beautiful and cool, too. I mean, Marilyn, you could have any guy you wanted. Really? Ooh, that's so sweet. One day, you're gonna find the most awesome girl. Here? There. Did I already say this place is so gross? Hey, come on, all right? Just pretend you're outside by a pretty lake. Use your imagination. I'm not screwing on this bed. Who said anything about screwing? My turn next, though. Hey, scout's honor, baby. I can't believe I'm doing this. Jesus! What, what's wrong? Too much teeth? - What was that? - Sounded like screaming. - Should we go check it out? - Yeah, yeah, you go. I'm just gonna find my glasses. I'll be right behind you. Hurry, Tobe. Smooth, Tobe. Very smooth. Damn it. Thank God. Who... What happened? - My God. - Tell me about it. What the fuck is that, Johnnie? Sean? This must have taken hours. Hey, man, look, if you wanna stay here and play psycho-art appreciation, you be my guest. Me, I'm trying to get the hell up out of here. Who's with me? Some of these are human. - Jesus, please, no. - Shh, quiet. Okay, if someone comes though this door, we jump him. Can't hurt all of us, maybe none of us if we can tackle him, okay? - Johnnie, kill the light. - Okay. Now! Get off me! What the hell are you people doing? Yeah, sorry, we... we thought you were someone else. Who else would I be? Jesus. Is that made from people? Shit. Guys, I think I know where we are. I think I heard about this place. - What are you talking about? - The name on the mailbox. You telling me you guys ain't never heard of the Joads? Junior Joad and his psycho family? - Yeah. - No, no, that story's bullshit. - What story? - They were killers. Not just killers. Right. Cannibals. The rumors said they'd become wild animals, feeding off the local wildlife and... anything or anyone who came along. Police showed up. They killed the family. Supposedly they found parts of, like, 30 people. Parts? That isn't real. It's just a story to scare kids. Is it? I think this was my sister's. I gave this to her. No way. No fucking way. - No, how? - She ran away. Guys, where's Tobe? He dropped his glasses in the barn. He's still... My God. Tobe? Tobe? You really think that's hers? Your sister's I mean? Do you remember what we talked about in Anthropology? How cannibals believe they take power from the people they eat? Adrienne. You don't think they take their souls, do you? What if Laurie's trapped? What if she can't go where she's supposed to be? Look, she is not trapped anywhere, okay? If she died here... hey. If she died here, she is in heaven now, okay? I promise. Wait, wait, what if Tobe's not in the barn? Then we go. Fuck Tobe. You're an asshole, you know that? Nice. Look, Johnnie's right. If Tobe's not in the barn, then we keep moving, get to the road, get back to the bus. - Fucking A. - And just leave him? Man, that is messed up. Look, if something's happened to Tobe, then the best thing we can do for him is get help. Best case, he'll meet us back at the bus. Yeah, worst case? Well, we all heard that, right? - God. - Okay, okay, everyone chill. Okay, that sound could have come from anywhere. That's Tobe! - That's Tobe! I know it is! - Where are you going? Let me go! We have to help him! No, Marilyn, wait. Everybody, wait. We gotta be smart about this. Okay, Johnnie, you come with me. Wes, you stay here with the girls. All right, what's our play? I think the sound came from over there. God. Fuck me. Okay, we gotta get the girls out of here. - Wait, what are you two doing? - Nothing. Stay back, guys! Stay back! No! Tobe! Tobe! Adrienne! - Come on! Go! Go! - Adrienne! No, let go of me! - No, I gotta help her! - She's already dead! Move! Move! Go, man, go! We're gonna fucking die! Move your ass! Let's go! Go in the house! All right, lock the doors! All of them! Sean! What the hell happened out there?! I don't know! Well, I do. It's one of those fucking Joads, and we're the buffet. Man, why the hell did we come back here? I was following him! Tobe's gonna die, too, if we don't help him, okay?! What are you guys waiting for?! We have to go help him! - No, fuck that! - Are you people blind?! The killer's using Tobe as bait. My best friend is dead. Please let this not be happening. Well, it's happening, okay? Look, we can all talk about how fucked up it is later, but right now, we need to start figuring out a way to get out of here alive. Someone will see the bus, right? They'll come looking for us. So we're just gonna wait here? I don't want to be eaten by a cannonball. - It's "cannibal," God damn it! - That's what I said! Nobody's gonna get eaten, okay?! We're gonna stay here, stay smart, and make it until morning, and then we'll make a break for it. Not tonight. It's too risky. Riskier than waiting around here for that psycho to show back up? What do you think you're gonna do with that? If that motherfucker comes near me, I'm gonna introduce this to his skull. Yeah, Wes is right. Let's all grab something. Let's mess him up. That make you feel better? A little bit, yeah. So what's the plan? Okay, Jamie, Marilyn, and I will secure the downstairs. Wes, you take the upstairs. Johnnie, Heather, secure the main floor. If someone comes through that front door, we should hear it. Come on. You okay, baby? I... I've just never seen anyone die before. Flashlight. Here. Guys, this is creepy. Okay. Marilyn, here. Okay. Okay. We can think of this as our Alamo, okay? This must head outside. If someone comes in upstairs, we get down here, get to the yard, and back to the bus, okay? Get upstairs! Now! Now! Quick! Go! Go! Go and lock the door! Get out of here! No! Come on! Come on! Hey, you guys chill out! Chill out, slow down. Where's Sean? He's in the cellar. We have to go. - Sean? - Him! The killer, you idiot! He killed Sean? Are you sure? - Of course we're fucking sure! - Screw this. No, get the fuck off me! I'm gonna kill this fucking freakazoid! - Johnnie, no! - We gotta go, man. We have to get back to the bus! And then what? So he can find us there, too? No, let's do this now! Maybe he won't follow us there, Johnnie! - Maybe he won't go that far! - Yeah, and maybe he will. Johnnie, we gotta get the fuck out of here, man! Fine. Let's go! All right, once we get outside, we haul ass, you hear me? Back door! Help me get the fridge! Go, go! Come on! - This way! - Where the hell are we going? I don't know! Is he still behind us? We have to keep moving. We have to help him. He's still alive. It hurts. What's he saying? Kill me. Look! All right, we can take care of this psycho right now. You good? - No, fuck this! - Run! He's out there somewhere. He sounded pretty far away. I say we make our move. - I don't know. - Well, I do. I've been following you people around all night, and so far, it's gotten three of us killed. I don't wanna be next. Do you? - No. - Good. Now come on. We're gonna find out where that mother fucker is and as we know he ain't coming, we run like hell, you got it? All right, come on. I don't wanna go out there. He's gonna get us, Wes. We're gonna be fine. Look, we'll go out the back door. It's closest to the road. Be careful. Quiet. All right, we're all clear over here. Shit! No! No! No! No! - Marilyn! - Wes! Marilyn! No! Wes! God, please, no, no! - We should help her. - Screw that. Shut that dog up. Shh, shh. Okay, let's go. - Ew, what is this place? - Shh! Keep quiet and follow me. We're not out in the open, are we? Okay, we just need a place to hole up for the night. It's gonna be okay, Precious. Come on. That barn, it's just across the way. All right, but you gotta be quiet. You got it? Johnnie? It's okay. Don't look. We're gonna make it, okay? But we need to keep our heads. I think we can hide out here until morning. At night, that crazy fuck can come out of anywhere. I don't wanna die, Johnnie. Okay, I'm gonna take care of you. You need to keep that thing quiet. Stay close. Come on. Stay close. Okay, we'll be safe in the back of this, okay? Are you sure? Trust me, baby. Okay, get in. You punks are gonna pay. Hello? Joyriding delinquents. Shh! We have to keep still. This thing creaks and moans like an old woman. Hey, you're doing great, Heather, okay? Everything's gonna be fine. Try and relax. We're sleeping right here, okay? I don't think I'll ever sleep again. In the morning, we'll bust out, hit the road. I'll bet the bus will be filled with cops by then. And they'll have blankets and coffee, and you can fucking A be sure they'll have donuts, too. And we'll go home. We'll get old and fat, and we'll have a ton of kids. I love you, Johnnie. Shh. What's wrong with her? Maybe the bad man is back. Shh. Heather! Just keep her quiet. Shh. Shh! Heather! I mean it, Heather. One bark from that thing and we're dead, understand that? Shh. - What are you doing? - It's gonna be okay. - Did he hear? Is it him? - Shh! I don't know. Quiet. We have to go. We'll bust out here and make a break for it. Heather. Help! Help! Help! Help! No, no! No! No! If I can track the VC in the rainy season, I can damn sure find these brats. Jamie! I didn't think anyone was left. What happened? Don't worry, I'll survive. You okay? We're all that's left. How can you know that? Wesley... No. I heard his eye pop, Jamie. When the glass hit it, I heard it pop. It was horrible. It's gonna be okay, Mar. No. It's not. It's not. We're gonna die here. By the time anyone finds us, we'll be dead. You're cold. And sweating, too. Look, Marilyn, focus on what I'm saying. You're going into shock, that's all. You're gonna be all right, but you have to stay focused, okay? Okay. I mean it, Marilyn, you have to stay with me. I will, I... I just need to sit down. - I just... - No. You have to stay up. Otherwise you're just gonna pass out. I can't drag you. You understand what I'm saying? Yes. Okay. Give me a second to find something to fight back with. I got him pretty good with a rock back there. I think he may be the devil, Jamie. I don't know. He must be... a demon from hell or something. I looked into his eyes. What we need to worry about right now is getting back to the bus. It's hopeless. It's over now. What do you think? I think it's fate. My God. Hello?! Someone please help me! Who is that? Adrienne? Here! I'm over here! Mr. C! We have to go. Jamie, you and your friends are in some trouble... Fuck your trouble! Jamie, don't you talk to me like that. They're dead. They're all dead. Who? - All of them! - What? How? This guy killed them all. We have to go. We leave no man left behind. Now stand down and tell me where they are. You don't understand. We have to get out of here now. Are they in there? Are they in the house? Where are they? Come on. Jamie, get in the house. Close the door and don't come out until I say so. No, no, he'll get you. You have to come inside. He's just a man, a man who's gonna have to get through me to get to one of my kids. Now stay in there. All right. I'm no teenager. I was in the 'Nam, you sick fuck! And I got chunks of guys like you in my stool! Come on, you commie, pinko, fag bastard. I've killed more men than you could possibly imagine. One more is fine with me. You Hanoi chink piece of shit! Mr. C? Mr. Cunningham?! Leave me alone! Adrienne. Open! How do you like that?! No, no, no. Fuck. Come on, Mr. C. Have something I can use. Come on. ABP. Just breathe. Just breathe. All right. I made it. No. Help! Help me! My God. Hey. Hey, are you okay, mister? Hey. What the f... Hey, you stay right there or I will shoot. I mean it! Shoot! Son of a bitch. Hell of a mess, Sheriff. I've never seen nothing like it. Junior Joad. Now that's one bad penny I never thought I'd have to see again. How you doing, sweetheart? You okay? Can you tell me how many other people were with you? Seven. They're all dead. But where are they? Where are your friends? The house. The house on the hill. Okay. Okay, look, get some rest. These folks, they're gonna take real good care of you. Then I'll come back in a little while. I'll check up on you, all right? You're gonna be okay. You'll be okay. What is it? She said something that shook you up pretty good. You hadn't even joined the force when we had our troubles. You gonna keep me in the dark, Sheriff, or is this some type of ghost story? It's worse. It's a lot worse. The Joads, they never came to town at the end. Some people thought they'd picked up and moved off. Then we started getting the calls. Somebody's kid went missing. And then somebody's wife, somebody's husband. Me and a couple of the boys, we went up there. Emmett Joad! This is your last chance! Sheriff, we're gonna eat you alive! We killed every last one of them. Or so we thought. Until today. Junior must have been up here hunting by himself for a long time.
