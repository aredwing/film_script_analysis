TO ALL THE RAIL WORKERS Damn you! Some day I'll come back to split you in two. BLACK WIND STARRING FILMED IN THE GREAT ALTAR DESER IN SONORA, MEXICO. Mr. Manuel Iglesias? Yes, gentlemen. Until today... ...the Altar Desert was an insurmountable obstacle. It's you, the engineers, technicians, and rail workers... who will resume the work which was considered impossible... ...owing to its scale and the physical difficulties involved. Many of you... Come here, Manuel. This guy was my classmate freshman year. He wanted to be an engineer, but got mixed up with a status-obsessed woman, and... Poor Manuel. She tore him to pieces. Manuel. It's my great honor to present you with this paper, and this badge, which certify you as Head Crew Chief of the South Division. I know you'll wear that badge with pride, Manuel. Good luck, "Major". Manuel! Forgive me, sir. Here, have it back. Report to your post, Manuel! And in the future, control your temper! I could've accepted his resignation for his lack of respect... ...but he's very valuable to me. You were asking for it. You knew full well that calling him Major was an insult. He's not a military man? No. Some rail workers call him... ..."a major son of a bitch." For his fiery temper. That's all, gentlemen. Good luck. My dad's here. -He's leaving. Let him go. Let me go, Mom. He's my father. Dad! Dad! Boss, I've got those indians lined up for you. Go to your truck and send me the chief. You're the head man? -The mayor. Tell them it's a tough job, a job for men. I don't want to mislead anyone. When it's hot, it's hell. When it's cold, it's freezing. The pay you know. Whoever agrees, get in a truck. (Indian language) They say they agree to go work, and to behave properly... ...with dedication, so long as you keep your word. Have them say goodbye to their families and then get in the trucks. Leave him alone! Don't touch him! With your rough, dirty hands, you should never caress our boy! Go play with your rail workers. Don't you understand, Manuel, that you're a brute? Boss, boss. Boss. We're all set. This is our last stop. Tell Slim to head for camp. Okay, boss. SOUTH CAMP Nabor! Tiny! The engineer is calling you. The people are here. At your command, sir. -Welcome. How was your trip? This is all I could get. A few Yaqui, Pima, Papago, and Mayo indians. I'd say it's a real feat because they're reluctant and distrustful people. Men, it's my pleasure to introduce Manuel Iglesias, Head Crew Chief of our South Division. Nice to meet you. Pablo here will be your assistant. Pablo Penados at your service, sir. This is Nabor Camargo, our guide. He speaks all the region's dialects. At your command, sir. He knows the desert like the back of his hand. When the black wind covers or destroys all the markers, he can find paths where there are none. And this is one of our best men. Javier Santana. He's a real devil with the acetylene torch. Nice to meet you, boss. He's so weak and short that nobody calls him by his real name. His coworkers nicknamed him Tiny. Ah, and this is Picuy. Head rodman. Crafty, half rogue and half poet. Be careful with him, Manuel. That's what they say, and my boss does agree, but as a worker, no one's keener than me. Stop, stop! Stop! What's going on? Everyone stop! Come on, stop! Manuel! Everyone stop it! Keep order, Manuel... ...but don't go too far. I forgot to tell you that we're getting the heavy machinery soon. What happened? I asked you what happened! They wouldn't get out, we forced them, and they attacked us. Ask them what happened. Truth is, they say the drivers manhandled them. And they claim they won't stay without their families. Their families? It's six months of construction in the southeast. No! But a man needs his family, Luisa. My son and I won't consort with your filthy coworkers! What do I tell my people, boss? Tell them the workers' families can't be here. The women and children would end up getting sick. But I give my word as a man that they'll be treated like anyone else! I won't let anyone abuse them! Mess with them and you'll be sorry! Get back to work. Now! And what are you waiting for? Didn't you hear? Go! Nabor. What did they say? -That they trust you, boss. Get them set up in their barracks. How are they, Pablo? -It's hard, sir, but they'll learn. More men to move that flatcar, hurry. -Yes, sir. Pablo. -Yes, sir? -I need Nabor. More ties for this section! Move it! Ready. Down. Up. Even, even. Even, even. Go forward. Forward, stay even. Even, even. Even, even, even. A little more. Okay, okay! -Okay, the other one. Ready. It's 8:00 AM and the sun's already blazing. By noon, we'll be burned to a crisp, man. Don't just stand there! Get to work! What's with you? Didn't you hear? Come on. You guys too! We have to reach 1500 today. Hey, hurry up. The train won't be long. Hey, I'm dying of thirst. Me too, kid. Brat, didn't you hear me? Sorry, my godson no Spanish. Juanjo! What is this crap? -New guy. What'd I tell you? This is salted coffee. Know what it's for, idiot? So you don't die of heatstroke. Live or die, I don't care, but we need hands here, got it? Drink! Juanjo! PAYMASTER Get in line! Get in line! I run this line! Order, or nobody gets paid! -Order, guys, or nobody gets paid. What's happening, big fella? -Not much, man. Now that the camp's moved, what'll you do with all that money? Well, go see a movie, stroll around the park, and walk in the trees for a lark. Ticket. Well, what do we do now? Go swimming, to the movies, or to a bullfight, eh? We're screwed, guys. All this dough, and nowhere and nohow to spend it. But I'll tell you one thing: One day soon, air-conditioned Pullmans will pass through here, and the riders will even have a bar to serve them ice-cold beer... ...and won't know what a pain it was to lay down the track. What can you do... Picuy, how about a pun contest? You name the wager. As for me, like the poet said: "I avoid the action, so as not to..." Picuy! What's up, man? -Still hoarding money? What's the use here? -Well, to buy a piece of land. Work it with my kids and become independent. That's why I endure this sun... ...patiently. All right. Picuy, the boss is calling. On a Sunday? What'll you do with all that dough? -Me? Send it all home. Same here, man. Me, I'll have a few pun-offs. What's that, eh? Who knows, man. Maybe it's a mirage. Ghosts? Please... Where the hell did this dude come in from? I came from Sonorita. Me, Ulalio Indian. Well, the "Indian" bit's clear, but your name must be "Eulalio". No. Ulalio. Okay, man. You win. Take this and get lost. I no ask you for money. I look for boss to ask for work. Work here? See that guy in the black boots? He's the boss. He'll give you work. But you have to call him Major. You got that? Major. I understand. You're a real SOB, Tiny. Poor bastard, doesn't even know what's coming. First thing tomorrow, have these repainted. -Yes, sir. Major. Why did you hit me? I only came to ask for work. Get treated in the infirmary... ...and report to work tomorrow. I need gutsy men like you... ...to build railroads. Pablo! Yes, sir? See that he gets clothes and food. -Follow me. What happened, Manuel? An embarrassing incident for me. It's here! It's here! Picuy. Private Not-Worth-A-Toss at your service, boss. Quit clowning around and tell the Greek to set up 500m from camp. Got it? 500m from camp! Not an inch less! Got it, sir. Not an inch less. God save us from their breasts and their thighs. Take care, guys! On this, we really need to look the other way, Manuel. Let's hope there are no disturbances. Stop, Monkey. I'm getting some tonight, that's for sure! You've got 'em covered up 'cause they're dogs! No, they're pure-blooded odalisques. They're from my homeland, through and through. Calm down a minute, guys! Calm down a minute. My girls are worn out from the trip. Just from the trip, Greek? My dolls can't play with you until you set up their little house. So now you know. If you hurry, tonight you'll have your bacanora... ...and appetizers! Guys, just a minute. First measure from the base 500 meters in all, then you can build the place, and go have a ball. Where will you put the shack? Out of earshot, 500 meters back. 500 meters? But that's so far! Don't worry, we'll all come to the bar. Look, Picuy. Come, come. All right, 350m. But mum's the word, eh? That's that, but as a tip, fix me up with the light-skinned bird. Monkey... -Twenties, twenties. This is not a wedding or a quinceaera, so pay your due. Pay your due, pay your due. How about your 'do, eh? Come on, cueball. Ready, boss! Damn, it's dustier and smokier in there than inside the black wind. You've got that right, pal. Pass the bottle. What's with that guy? -I don't know. What are you doing here all alone, man? Aren't you gonna go inside for a bacanora? They've got some great appetizers. I have no money. Major! Major! Come on out, Major! Major! Major! Major! Don't be scared, Major. And don't scowl at me, 'cause here I come! Hit him! Lorenzo Montes! You bastard, it's so great to see you! Major, you son of 50.000 demons! I thought I'd never see you! -Well, here we are. We came to work. We came on a flatbed with these blessed animals. Boys. This is Manuel Iglesias, head crew chief. My best friend, like a brother to me. Don't even think of calling him Major or he'll break your nose. Only I can do it, right, Major? A real pleasure, boys. -Great to see you. Pablo, these men are tired. Take them to eat, then to their beds. To hell with bed! We want to wet our beaks! What about women, boss? -Damn straight! Well, there's the Greek's place. -You heard him, boys. Let's wet our whistle and baptize these blessed animals, eh? Because they're thirsty too. Come with us, Manuel. No, I know. Don't tell me. I know you. You don't drink and you have to get up early. But stay for the baptism. Dim those lights, boys. Pablo, if Fernandez asks for me, you know where I am. In the name of the desert, I christen you "The Stink Beetle". Holy water in one, two, three. In the name of the desert, I christen you "The Coyote". Doe! -Teddy bear! You're gorgeous. I never thought you'd be here. Hey, Picuy. Help me get them inside. Time is money. And, you know, eh? Everyone! Hallelujah, hallelujah, grab a woman close to ya, I have this one, and you've had a few, yah? Short stuff! Boys, turn off those lights. I've got my own torch. -Think you can douse my flame? Yes, because after so much time and work... a night of love... ...is what I really deserve. Isn't that right? Damn materials still aren't here. And they told us a while ago the train was coming. We have to make up for lost time. That's right. If not for their damn phone lines, we'd still be working. The communication lines are necessary. Yeah, but this is too much! Enough. Go get your people and have them ready. Hot coffee, boss? Here it comes! Let's let it through or Major will have a fit. And with this damn cold, I'm in no mood. Come on, everyone unload! Quick! Let's go, let's go. Move it. What are you doing, idiot? -The brakes failed! Get sand on the rails! The train's coming! Bring ties! Move it! Bring 'em over! They're coming! Watch out! To this side! Bring ties! Now! Hurry! Careful with the cable! The flatbeds are gonna overturn! Cover your face, Lorenzo. And you get down, macho idiot! Hold it upright! Ties to the end, hurry! Hang in there! I've got it propped up. Now get down! Watch out! Juanjo. Help lift this rail, quick! Nabor... Let's go, son. -No! My leg. No, my leg. -Quick, to the infirmary! No, no. My legs... Is it stable? Yes, it's well-braced. Send for a crane. Put those away. We don't need them now. What happened? -An accident. It had a heavy load and the brakes failed but we managed to prop it up. The crane's coming. Casualties? -Just one man injured. Two, sir. Just look. Someone with huge ones uncoupled the car, but left his fingers. Who was it? That kept the flatbed cars from overturning. Find out who it was, Manuel. Acts of valor like this must be rewarded. Did you lower the pressure? -Yes, sir. Everyone unload! Hurry, the sun will be on us soon! Pablo. More ties at the end. Guys, I need men here and ties at the end. Come on! Watch out for that rail! Move your legs! I just arrived at camp, full stop. Answer me right back, telling me how you are, full stop. Be sure to let me know when my child is born, full stop. Love, Antonio. I'm gonna be a father. Congratulations, man. -Thank you. -Pass that here. Hey, Tepepa! Take Mr. Lopez and Mr. Jimenez... -It's "Engineer"! Take the gentlemen to Barrack 15, please, and help them. Your name? Jorge Iglesias Lamadrid, surveying engineer. Sorry, are you related to Manuel...? He's my father. What, anything wrong with that? -No, no... no, sir. Barrack 5, please. The jeep is waiting for you. Sir, I'm Pablo Penados, your Dad's assistant. I wanted to tell you... -Jorge! I want to shower, hurry! Is it far? -No, it's just there. -Go! Your dad couldn't come because he's out hiring more men, but he'll return early tomorrow. I'll take you to his barrack. Is Lorenzo Montes here? He wrote me that he'd come here. In his barrack, sir. I can take you. -Okay. -It's over there. Lorenzo told me all about you. It's obvious he's really fond of you. He even calls you his nephew. Dad. Dad. What are you doing here? -I came to help you build railroads. Did you hear me, Dad? To help you build railroads. And most importantly, Manuel: Don't forget that Jorge is refined, that he takes after me. She keeps repeating that damn word to me every second, Lorenzo, and I want my son to be a real man. But railroads are built by men. Are you one yet? What happened? Never mind him. He's like that. You'll get used to it. You won't believe it after what just happened, but Manuel is a good man. You'll talk with him later. Excuse me, sir. -What is it? -Well, I came to... Anything to do with your filthy bar goes to Picuy, not me! One of your men has been at my place for three days and won't leave. And I don't want any problems with the camp's bosses, least of all with you, Manuel. Please understand. Girls, girls! Here comes Major! The Greek's with him. Tramps! Skanks! You all need a bath! Don't start sweeping now. Can't you see the gentleman is here? I hit you once for being rude. Now it's for being lazy and drunk! It was you who decoupled the flatbed car, right? Why didn't you tell me? How the hell did you heal up, you indian brute? With salt! Like a real indian... man! Get him anything he wants, and send him to me tomorrow. So you're gonna get the VIP treatment today, eh? And for free! He's gonna pay for you. Monkey, take him to Chala. Yes, boss. Who is it? It's me, Jorge. Come in. I came to talk with you, Dad. You can talk. The boy doesn't understand Spanish. RAILROAD SURVEYING METHODS THESIS TO MY FATHER, WITH ADMIRATION AND RESPEC Whatever it is, say it. I'm very busy. I don't get why you're so harsh to me. I studied hard, thinking that when I got my engineering degree, you would be proud... ...but you still treat me with contempt like always. Ever since I was a kid, you've treated me like a stranger, and I always feared you. But I'm a man now! I'm entitled to know what goes on in my family! Maybe you cheated on my mother... ...and that's why. Or she was unfaithful to you. -Shut your mouth! A child has no right to judge their parents! If I'd cheated on her, I'm man enough to admit it. And if she'd done it to me, right now you'd be an orphan! Some day you'll learn the real reasons. Now leave me. Manuel. I just heard Lorenzo and Tiny are fighting over Doe in that dump. She's a problem, Manuel. Get inside, girls! Quick, get inside! Here comes Manuel Iglesias! Quick, inside! Stop it or they'll close the bar, and then where will you go for fun? Go, Tiny, go. And you, calm down. Calm down, eh? Tomorrow that whore's outta here! Which one? -Doe. I don't want her causing more conflicts. Not gonna happen. -It isn't? -No! I'm making her my wife. -You idiot! Her? She'll leave this life, and I'll make her respectable! Lorenzo... What do you think, Manuel? That you're a child, a stupid child... ...but it's your life. Greek, one more incident and I'll close this dive, I swear it! How unlucky, and on a Sunday! We're screwed. If this keeps up... ...nothing will open. -Why? -With this wind there's no copin'. Shut that! The cards are blowing away! I'm running hot, let's start another pot! Jimenez! Where are you? Let's go! Hey you! Yeah, you. Remember! She's my wife. Sir! Look what he dropped. Holy shit! Let me, baby. Let me. Doe, come on. Doe! Doe, come here! Doe, Doe! I warned you she was my wife. I'm gonna kill you! Lorenzo! Where's Carlos Jimenez? Did you kill him? No, not me. He's a coward. But without meaning to, he went to pull the tiger's tail. In what direction? -Northwest. Pablo, find him quick! Ulalio! Say hello to the boss. -'Evening, sir. How's that hand, Ulalio? It's fine. Hopefully at the end of this, these Indians will be good workers. We're getting there, sir. -We've progressed a lot, Manuel. In two days, we'll have to move the camp here. It's very far away now. Excuse me, sir. Black wind. 500 meters of rail has no ballast or sand protection. I'll protect the railway. -I'll handle the camp. Good luck. Everyone protect the railway! Now! Bring ties and set them along the rails so the sand doesn't cover them! Come on, you too! Come on! Take those to the end! Hurry! More ties! Tie it down, Too! Hurry or this damn wind will cover the track. Go, quick! Do the barrier in fours. Hey, you heard me! In fours. Pablo. Cover the sections with creosote! Hurry up, move it! And you, idiot, get to work! You can't make them work in this. They'll go blind. Keep making the barrier! -Come on, let's help. Unload! It's not your son talking. It's an engineer. Bring those over here! Grab the other end. Carry ties! Everyone! You deaf, pal? Didn't you hear? Go carry ties! My job is welding... ...not carrying. -In emergencies, you carry ties. Stay back, let them fight! If you step in, I'll kick your ass! Stay back! You can kill me afterward, but carry ties now! Get to work everyone! Now! You were right to show Tiny who's boss... ...but in hitting Jorge, you went beyond "major". And I mean that! I'm getting sick of you too. Don't abuse my friendship, Lorenzo! Major! Major! Come out, asshole. Major! Come out! Major! Major! General of the division! Come out, Major! Why did you hit Jorge? Why? Major! That's right! Major! Pick on someone your own size! Let's see you hit me, asshole! -Calm down, Lorenzo. Get off me. I know why you hit him. Because you don't love him. And you're an unfeeling ogre. -That's not true. Maybe his mother shaped him... ...but you know he's a tough guy. A really tough guy! Why'd you hit him? Why! Lorenzo! You know! You're the only one who does! Nobody loves Jorge more than I do. Not even his vain mother. Listen to me, Lorenzo. I have three reasons to live: My son. Splitting this damn desert in two. And your friendship. He wants to be like you. Give him a chance. Give him a chance. Give him a chance. "I'm a poor little deer who lives in the mountains." "Since I'm not so tame..." Good morning, sir. -Morning. Hey, Pablo. Yes, sir? You got a coffee over there for... a little wake-me-up? With, or without? Oh no, without! I'll be right back with it. Remember that your job is very important. Your path must meet exactly with the one from the north. Even if it takes you more time, don't go working past 11:00 AM on me. Don't forget that the desert is a sleeping tiger... ...which can wake at any moment. I asked Lorenzo to go, as he's the most experienced at desert driving. The poet's going with you too. Isn't that right, Picuy? Yes siree! For measurements, you can count on me. Okay, let's get to it. Every time you finish or start a new stage, report back by radio. Materials come yet? They're stopped at 150. We're awaiting reports, sir. Keep us informed. -Yes, sir. -Iglesias, come. Good luck, guys! Man. You must be tired of me, huh? Send this one too, please. As soon as there's a reply, read it to me when I radio in, will you? Of course. Hoping for a boy or girl? -Whatever God wills. So long as it's born healthy... ...and with pants. The curve at 190 needs reinforcing. -Very well, sir. Don't be upset, but it seems you won't go with the survey team. But... -Talk to your dad. Picuy. What is it now? I can't go with them? I came to discuss that. Your mother wrote to Fernandez imploring him to keep you from danger. But that doesn't matter. Do you want to go? Of course I do. Fernandez, when does that survey team leave? Right now, Manuel. So what's this engineer waiting for? Thanks, Dad. Son. A letter from your mother. Read it. Study it. And when you get back, we'll talk. Okay, Dad. All ready, sir. Enough water and gas? -Yes, sir. Two drums of this size. "Lend me your umbrella, because I'll be sunbathing on other beaches." See you. You did the right thing, Manuel. We have to trust our kids. What happened there? Nothing, sir. Black wind. Hey Picuy, how does that one go? "You're tall and slim. Your beauty tempts me." "What a nose, what a mouth..." -Manuel. Jorge finally got his way. He'll be at your side. But like I promised, he's coming as an engineer. That's right, Manuel! An engineer! I made him into what you could never achieve. Thanks to me... ...now he won't be a laborer with rough, calloused hands like you. Now I want a divorce more than ever. And most importantly, Manuel... ...don't forget that Jorge is refined, that he takes after me. Give it some gas! -Come on! Gotta uncap it or it'll gasify and create pressure with the heat. How'd it go, guys? All right. I was on the brink, so thirsty I couldn't think. I'm sick of you! Can't you give it a rest? Sorry if I'm a pest. Enough! Remember, the truck uses more than us. We have so much, we could even bathe. Without a doubt, our mate cooks great, even if he seems like a lout. Survey Team calling South Division, over. South Division responding to Survey Team, over. Survey Team reporting: We finished the first day. We'll resume work at midnight. Lopez speaking. Nothing for me? Over. Report received. Your wife's reply still hasn't come, over. Thank you. Over and out. Damn sand! Are you thinking about when your dad slapped you? When we're isolated from the rest of the world... ...we always think about someone. Me, for example... All I do is think about my wife... ...and about how I can't be by her side when she needs me most. Anything wrong with that? Oh momma! Wow, that's scorching! Gave my bum a proper torching! Some fear this desert and its sand... ...but looking at it closely, it's a beautiful land. Yes... at this time, the desert looks best... ...but don't forget: it's a tiger at rest. That's why you shouldn't pull its tail. What's wrong, man? Nothing, Lorenzo. Did you tell your dad goodbye before you left? Yes. For the first time, he called me son and we spoke man-to-man. That damn ogre! Pure steel on the outside... ...but inside is a heart bigger than a volcanic crater. Survey Team to South Division, over. Survey Team to South Division, over. Survey Team, this is South Division. Wait a minute, over. Take that call. Go ahead, over. Nothing new to report from today. We'll resume work at dawn. Any news for me, pal? Over. Report received. The telegram came, Mr. Lopez. Just a minute. I'll read it to you. Still nothing, Antonio. I'm fine. Don't worry. As soon as it's born, I'll tell you. I've got the telegram all written out, except for the space to put... ...boy or girl. I miss you a lot. All my love. Alicia. Satisfied, man? What's wrong? Answer me, over. Satisfied. Thanks a lot. Over and out. Was the baby born yet? No. But everything is fine. I'd give anything to be with her now. And I'd give anything to be in the capital. You can go. Are you married? No. It's worse than that. If I leave this damn place, my old man will disinherit me. And that's a big chunk of change. He thinks I prefer money over my career. What do you think? Miss, can this dance be mine? Because I'm so fine? Well, not quite. It's because you have the fattest behind. I hope my grandma won't mind! Furrow. -Plow. Go for it! We finished much earlier than expected. I'll report back that we're returning. I'll go ahead and report back that we're returning. Wait, Too. Why don't we surprise Fernandez and continue surveying? The sun isn't bad yet and we can progress a lot. You're nuts! We have to go back! -I'll go! I'm game and I'll show it, like any good poet. Disrespectful punk! -Let go of him. Talk in rhyme or mess with me again, and I'll bash your face in. Let's keep going. Come on, Picuy. You know we all think you're great, but so there's no trouble... ...don't mess with him, eh? A little to the right. More. That's good. Stop it there. Hey, Julio. We have to plot a 40-degree curve. That's very tight. -Ice cream man's here! Salted coffee, men, even if it tastes terrible. That's precisely what I was calculating. If we weren't in the desert, I'd say that the truck is smoking. Yeah, it's like it's shimmering. The radio! The food! The water! There have to be good ones. There have to be! We've got nothing left! Calm down. Calm down? With no water or food?! Do you know what that means in the desert, idiot? It's not my fault, sir. I left everything in order. I don't understand what happened. I don't know how it could've happened... but I think that... ...that damn thing is behind it all! I told you all! But you didn't listen! We're gonna get roasted to death. We're gonna get lost in the desert! Shut up! As long as we have this compass, we won't get lost, okay? Now calm down or you'll make us all panic! From now on... ...we have to ration water. We have to think. We have to make a decision. -Let's go back. It's better to go on, Antonio. Why? Look. Here's our camp. And here we are. This is the North Division Camp, which we're closer to. Not only that, but their team is advancing this way. It's only 30 degrees. Then let's go north, and hope we find them soon. Everything burned up so fast. Picuy, bring the bag and the salted coffee I left there. We're gonna need it. I'll go see what I can get from the radiator. And who's gonna drink that filth? Everyone. When thirst takes over, it'll taste good. Look. What is it? Just what we needed! Black wind. Let's take cover behind the dune. Cover your mouth and nose, and close your eyes. Let's hope it passes quickly. It's over. Let's go. Was it good? Save the water, guys... ...because if we run out, we won't make it. What do we do? Rest or keep going? What do you say, Picuy? Forgive me, sir, but I'm not one to say. No, I've got nothing left. Come on, kid. Hang in there. If we have any hope of surviving, it's by walking at night too. Get up. Cry, kid. Let it out! Don't be ashamed. Later on, many of us will cry too. Night's coming. I hope they come looking for us. Picuy. Let me help you. When... when I can't go on... ...I'll tell you. Thank you, sir. South Division Camp calling Survey Team. South Division Camp calling Survey Team, over. Nothing? -Nothing, sir. I've been trying for hours with no reply. Something must've happened or their radio broke. Does Manuel Iglesias know? -Yes, sir. Has he asked about them? -That guy doesn't ask about anyone. Not even his son? No, sir. South Division Camp calling Survey Team. South Division Camp calling Survey Team, over. Drive slow when you get there or you may hit someone. Manuel. Yes, sir? Organize a rescue team immediately. When I'm done with my work. Right now! It's an order, Manuel. You're the only one who can find them. They're young men. Bring them back to me, Manuel. That bastard... ...has no guts. That's how he seems on the outside, but inside... ...I think he does. Pablo! Nabor! Bring torches, medicine, stretchers, flares, lots of water, cables, and oil. I can't force anyone. I need volunteers for the rescue team. Go save his son? If dad's a prick, son's a prick. Ain't that right, man? They're young guys. I'll go. Five meters between each man. We need to comb the desert. You heard him, let's go! -Come on. It starts from here. We'll follow the survey line and change shifts every two hours. Nabor, go ahead. Yes sir. Ready? Let's go! Shift change! Pablo! On the fly, go tell them! -Yes sir. Shift change! Shade! At last, shade! Careful your face isn't left exposed to the sun, because you'll get more burned up. Cover your face with your hat. This damn sun is unforgiving... ...and we'll be out for a while. I can't see. I'm blind. Where is everyone? Where is everyone? I'm blind! Water. Give me water. Water. You abandoned me! You abandoned me! Bastards! Cowards! Cowards! You abandoned me! Cowards! You abandoned me! Bastards! You abandoned me! You abandoned me! Wait. Wait. That was it for him. He killed himself? Poor guy. Every minute will be hell from now on. The tiger's awake now. It's got us cornered. Let's go. We have to keep going. Let's go, Picuy. He didn't wake up? Wake up, Picuy. Let's go. He was blind... and I wasn't seen... but oh wow... ...he got me clean. Let's make a stretcher of branches. Here, give him water. Hang in there, Picuy. Have some, Picuy. No, sir. It's for you all. No, Picuy. It's for everyone. Drink as much as you want. It's all useless. We lost Picuy. Wait, Jorge. I think we're carrying a dead man. It's useless. He's dead. Let's put him... ...face down. Let's go. Why? Poor Too. He was so excited for the baby. They mention the planes? -No, it's something else. Read it. Too. Congratulations, you're a dad. I'm doing well. Your gift... ...was a boy. All my love. Alicia. Hello? Hello?! Rescue Team to South Camp. Rescue Team to South Camp. Rescue Team to South Camp! Yes, it's Fernandez. Go ahead, Manuel. Over. We found the truck burned. The gasoline must have exploded. No bodies there. I think they headed for North Camp. I'll continue on, over. The planes finally came. They'll start searching at dawn. Give me your position, Manuel, and continue on, over. Kilometer 238. We've combed everything up to here. I'll go on. Try to radio North Division to see if they'll help. I already tried several times. We're out of range. Keep at it! Maybe they'll help. -Yes sir. Attention, North Camp. Attention, North Camp. This is South Division. This is South Division. Answer, North Camp. Over. We can't go any further. Let's rest. Drink, Jorge. I already had some. Enough. Save it. You have to live, son... because... you're an engineer... ...and you're young. Tractor drivers like me... ...we're a dime a dozen. Besides... ...I don't have anyone who needs me. The moon looks so beautiful. And so bright. Haven't you ever been... ...in love, Jorge? What are you writing? This light reminds me... ...of the nights I spent with Doe. What a fool. What a fool she was. We would have enjoyed them so much. I know what's eating you, kid. You'd like me to talk to you about... ...your father and mother. But... ...no, I don't like that. I shouldn't meddle in other people's lives. All I'll say... is that your father... is a great man... and right now... ...he's breaking his back looking for you. More flares! Keep your eyes peeled! Come on, faster! Black wind! Black wind! It doesn't matter! Keep going! Lorenzo? Lorenzo! Lorenzo. Lorenzo! Lorenzo! Lorenzo! Lorenzo! I found him, boss. Don't go. Dad, I'm writing you because I don't know if I'll ever see you again. The survey data is at the front of this notebook. I hope it helps to hasten the work that'll split the desert in two, which is your aspiration... ...and mine too. FOR THOSE WHO DIED I read and studied my mother's letter... and now I understand everything... ...but what can I say to you, if she gave me life? Maybe you'll find it impossible... but... ...I hope one day you can forgive her. You'll also find some words for her... ...which I beg you to pass on to her. She's my mother. I want you to know... that I am proud... ...of your rough and calloused hands. Of your laborer's hands... which, for my mother and me, put food on the table... ...and to which I also owe my engineering degree. Listen to me, Lorenzo. I have three reasons to live: My son. Splitting this damn desert in two. And your friendship. Go back, Juanjo. I said beat it! -No! No! No... THEIR DEATHS WERE NOT IN VAIN... THE RAILWAY WAS COMPLETED.
