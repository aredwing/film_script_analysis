This place gives me the creeps. Vanishing ships, sea monsters, aliens: All legends. Don't let them spook you. Anyway... ...we'll be out here a few more nights... ...and then my star map will finally be complete. Whatever you say, doc. We'll all be home safe and sound before you know it. Captain, you better take a look at this. Fog, dead ahead. Who's there? What the heck? Mayday, mayday. We're under attack. Here it be, captain. Perfect. But now, where is he? Maybe with the rest of the crew. Blimey. Board all hands below in the bilge and we'll sort them out later. It can't be. Ghost pirates? Like, man, no more mysteries. Finally, a trip where there are no monsters... ...ghosts, aliens, mummies or haunted tikis. Nothing but R, R and R: Rest, relaxation and round-the-clock eats. In other words, a cruise. - Just sun, fun and... - A buffet? Fred, it sure was nice of your parents to invite us all on a cruise for your birthday. So, Freddy, how old are you going to be? Forty-three. Forty-four, 45... Pier 45. This is it. No mysteries for a whole week. Midnight buffets and 24 hours of lounging. That's what I call living large. Extra large. What's going on, guys? I don't know. Something spooked Scooby. - A little scary dude. - Yeah. But there's no one around here like that... ...unless you think Hawaiian shirts, black socks and sandals are scary. They are. Very, very scary. Buddy, you need this vacation more than I realized. I hope you packed your sea legs. And a new set of eyeballs. - Pop! - Freddy! Hey, say... ...slide one by, hands to the sky. Well, thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs around, lost and found. - Love you, Pop. - Love you, too, through the woods. Freddy, my baby. Oh, it's my handsome baby boy. Have you ever seen such a good-looking boy? Give me some sugar. Mom, not in front of the gang. Hon, leave the boy alone. Oh, yeah, but he's just so sweet and delicious. Sure is great to see you again, Mr. And Mrs. Jones. Yeah, you, too, dear. My, my, haven't you blossomed. I hope you girls are taking good care of my special little guy. - Mom. - And Velma... ...you look smart as ever... ...but you have to let me show you my new Suzi Jay cosmetics. They'll bring a little color to your face. You'll never get a beau unless you add a little glow. - Thank you? - You betcha. Oh, and Norville... ...you're growing like a weed. But you're much too thin, dear. Are you eating enough? Twenty-four square meals a day. And that's still not enough. Oh, yeah? Then you need to try my 10-pound pound cake. It will put some meat on your bones. - I have one in here somewhere. - Mom. - I'll take it from here, hon. - Shake, boy. Just shake, no lick. Okay, thanks. Like, he only shakes when he's scared. So, Mr. Jones, where exactly is this cruise headed? Oh, yeah, that's a surprise. I've got the perfect birthday plan. Like father, like son. Ahoy there, mateys. Welcome aboard the Poseidon 's Paradise... ...the tiptop tidiest ship to travel the ocean blue. Hi, I'm Sunny St. Cloud, cruise director extraordinaire. Well, aren't you the perky one? We're the Jones party. And Jones, Jo... Perfect timing. This way, Jones party. There's no time to waste. We're just about to weigh anchor. Now that's ship talk. You landlubbers will be speaking like old sea dogs in no time. Like, we've got our old sea dog right here. Yeah, good, that's ni... That's funny... ...but let's get this cruise launched and have some fun. What do you say? Aye, aye. You're a natural, huh? Okey-dokey, everyone listen up. As you can see, the Poseidon 's Paradise has every amenity... ...for your seafaring pleasure. We have shuffleboard tournaments at 9, swimming at 10... ...racquetball at 11, rhythmic gymnastics at 12, field hockey at 1... ...conga line dance at 2, senior disco at 3, karaoke at 4, and my favorite: Wiffleball at 5. What have we here? Dear, Freddy, are you okay? - Did you get hurt, sweetums? - Ma. Where does it hurt, hon? Mom, I'm okay, really. Jeepers, what is that stuff? Some kind of goo. And it's shaped like a footprint. I guess you could say that. It is so alien. Please, don't say we have a mystery on our hands. Please don't say we have a mystery on our hands. Please, please, please, please. Well, gang, it looks like we have a... Mystery or not, there's no time now. Chop, chop. It's time for the big bon voyage. Now, wasn't that fun? Moving on with our schedule. Next up is unpacking. - What happened? - Scooby was right. I saw him too. Who, Shaggy? A little creepy dude with big, scary eyes. Yeah, he was the guy that Scooby saw on the pier. But there's no one creepy around here, Shaggy. Except maybe that guy. Creepy guy number four: Check. Okay, here are your cabins. Your bags should already be inside. But what about the creepy guy? No, no time for him now. No time for creeps. I can get on board for that. Me too. Good news. Captain Crothers wants to meet you. Oh, dear, and me without my pearls. And, captain, this is the Jones party. Thanks, hon. Welcome aboard. Gee, captain. Your ship, she's a beauty. Can I take the wheel? No. Captain Crothers, maybe you could solve a little mystery for us. What's our destination? Mystery. A good choice of words, young lady. We are bound for one of the most mysterious places on earth. The home of vanishing vessels, strange, eerie lights. Maybe even a sea serpent or two. We are headed to... ...the Bermuda Triangle. - Bermuda? - Triangle? Jiminy. Oh, sorry. The Bermuda Triangle. Oh, please. The legend of the Bermuda Triangle is just that: A legend. Trust me, after this cruise, you'll believe in the power of the Triangle. Oh, no, not again. Where did Captain Crothers go? Oh, no, whatever will we do? - Well, gang... - It looks like we have... ...a mystery on our hands. Look. It's an alien. Do you think the alien has something to do with the captain's disappearance? Well, gang, it's trap-setting time. You didn't think of that one, now, did you? And you know what that means, Scoob? Live bait. Okay, you know what to do. Go to the dining room, get something to eat and forget the whole thing? I didn't think that would work. Well, Scoob, seen any aliens yet? - Nope. - Well, then, maybe we're in the clear. Nope. Impressive, son. Your trap worked. Oh, yeah, we're so proud. But stand up straight, hon. Well, I think I have this mystery all figured out. - Really? That was quick. - Yeah. - Captain Crothers! - But why? Well, it wouldn't be much of a Bermuda Triangle mystery cruise... ...without an alien abduction, now, would it? Mystery cruise? - Surprise! - Surprise! Yeah, we know how much you kids love mysteries. And what better way to celebrate Fred's birthday? Oh, wow. Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Pop. Sunny? We'll get them yet, sir. Don't you worry. We've got mysteries aplenty. Well, I don't know what we're gonna do now. You've totally blown my schedule. And we've gone through a week's worth of mysteries in two days. Hear that, Scoob? From here on in, it's smooth sailing. So much for the big mystery cruise. Sorry, mysteries are kind of our thing. You guys are so smart, where's my missing watch? Let's see... ...you were probably excited about the cruise and unpacked in a hurry. I bet it fell out of your suitcase. It's probably... Under your bed. Honey, you'll never believe where I found your watch. Under your bed. What good is a mystery cruise if you don't get to solve any mysteries? Sorry, everybody, we didn't mean to ruin the cruise for you. There's still the Ping-Pong championship... ...or maybe the potholder-weaving seminar? The Popsicle-stick sculpture class? Anyone for checkers? Very impressive, kids. I doubt there's a mystery you can't solve. Like, there's one thing I don't understand. What's that, Shaggy? What's with the weird castaway out there? Man overboard. Are you okay, sailor? I don't know. - What happened? - I'm not really sure. I mean, I'm an astrocartographer, see, and I was making a star map... ...and all of a sudden my ship was attacked. Attacked? Oh, goodness gracious. By whom? I don't believe it myself, but by: Ghost pirates. Ghost? Pirates? Whoa, hold on now, before everyone panics, let's get Mr... - What's your name? - Rupert Garcia. We need to get Mr. Garcia down to the ship's doctor. You don't understand. This whole ship and everyone on it is in terrible, terrible danger. Now, now. Mr. And Mrs. Jones... ...would you take Mr. Garcia below to the ship's doctor? - You betcha. - The poor soul is delusional. Right. Dear, come on, let us help you. There you go. But really... ...they were ghost pirates. Look for the eerie lights in the fog... ...and their green, glowing eyes... ...and that terrifying laugh. It still echoes in my ears! Oh, how horrible. That poor man. Don't worry, Miss St. Cloud. We'll keep the "pirate puzzler" for the other guests to solve. An "ascot biographer." That's a good one. What are you...? Ahoy below. Now what? It's another alien. That's no alien. It's Biff Wellington, the eccentric billionaire. Billionaire, yes. But my dear, eccentric is in the eye of the beholder. Captain, permission to board your venerable vessel? - Permission granted. - I can't thank you enough, captain. Remind me to name a building after you. - Oh, nice jetpack. Can I try it? - No. Excuse me for asking, Mr. Wellington... ...but what are you doing out here? I am setting a new record for the first round-the-world jetpack flight. But as I was saying, it seems that I've run out of gas. I've heard of jet-setting, but this is ridiculous. You say ridiculous, I say tomato. Like adventurers of yore, I travel the air, high above the earth and sea. Just me and the elements battling for supremacy. Will I conquer the challenges of nature or will she do me in? But I have records to break, you know? About that fuel, captain... Okay. Why don't you follow me. I have to say, the eccentric billionaire with a jetpack is a nice touch, Sunny. - What do you mean? - Don't worry... ...we promised we wouldn't get involved. We're not getting involved in a mystery? Pinch me, I must be dreaming. You're awake. Time to move, people. Only 15 minutes before the costume party, dinner and mystery show. Oh, and please try not to spoil it. - Dinner? - Dinner? Yep, and remember you must have an original costume. No copycats. Is this original enough? Oh, no. The Jeffersons are gonna be leprechauns. Well, how about this? No, the Sheldons got that one covered. Nope, the Diazes. This could take all night. Let's go. The Chois. The Murphys. The Smiths. Wait. Come on, I know just the costume for you. Guys? Don't ask. It was either this or a horse costume... ...but neither one of us wanted to be the horse's patoot. Pop, are you wearing Rupert's old clothes? Can't get any more authentic... ...with a castaway costume than this, now, can you? Oh, gosh, isn't he adorable? I'd rescue you anytime, hon. Right back at you, my little, pinchable passion fruit. Pop. You're looking better, Rupert. Yes, thanks to Skip, I feel like myself before the ghost... Okay, okay. Enough of that silly pirate talk. We've got to get some food into you, young man. You're right. I am starved. Like, I second that. Me too. Everyone looks terrific, and more importantly, you're right on schedule. Dinner is being served and then it's time for the show. Dinner is all the show we need. Right, buddy? You said it. A rescued castaway and a visit from a famous billionaire. The Bermuda Triangle is full of surprises, isn't it? His castaway performance is very convincing. Performance? What do you mean? Oh, Sunny, you are good. Like, this is what I call a cruise. Not even a spooky mystery or a kooky costume... ...can spoil an all-we-can-eat buffet. What do you say we eat all we can eat, Scoob? Yeah. Forks down, everyone. I have a few quick announcements before we move on... ...to tonight's fabulous shipboard entertainment. Open-air aerobics with Bambi will be starting tomorrow... ...at 6:20 instead of 6: 15 on the Aloha deck. Let's get physical. Let's see. Oh, yes. For all you bingo lovers, we'll be holding our Triangle tournament... ...at 3:00 on the promenade deck. Be sure and buy your cards before the game. You get it? B-4? In bingo. Okay, never mind. It's time for the show. Ladies and gentlemen... ...from over the seas and lands beyond our consciousness comes Mr. Mysterio. He knows all and sees all. But be careful, lest he take control of your very mind. Wait a second. I don't need a mind reader... ...to tell me that the creepy little guy in the black cape is right behind us. Will you assist me... ...in a journey to the depths and edges of your conscious mind? No, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, let's show these two chickens some encouragement. Oh, you'll have to do better than that. Shaggy, Scooby. Shaggy, Scooby. Shaggy, Scooby, Shaggy, Scooby. Shaggy, Scooby... Come on, guys, you know they won't stop until you go up there. Let's just get this over with. Are you ready to witness the amazing power of hypnosis? I'd rather witness the amazing power... ...of the double-cheese pizza back at my table. Yeah. Oh, no. Not again. What did you say? - Daphne? - What's going on? Kids? Oh, gee, Skip, you're missing the best part here. They're coming. I know it. These special effects are incredible. How did they do that? You don't get it, do you? Really, son. The charade has gone too far. You're scaring everyone. You should be scared. You are getting very relaxed. You are getting very sleepy. Your limbs feel very heavy. What the...? Get the captain. I command you: Bark like a dog. Like, the whole ship is going to the dogs. I command you to dance. Like, all we know is the Funky Chicken. Stop. When I say the magic word, you will be released from your trance. You will not remember any of what has occurred. Do you understand? Yes, Mr. Mysterio. Three, two, one. Alazamboozle. What happened? Now what? Blackout? I didn't schedule a blackout. Oh, this is gonna throw everything off. I know I'm not gonna like the answer but I'll ask anyway: What was that? Ghost pirates. Told you I wouldn't like it. Zoinks. Yeah, zoinks. Who dares sail into the Bermuda Triangle? Ye have crossed paths with Captain Skunkbeard the pirate. And now ye shall pay the price. Oh, cheese and crackers. We have to get out of here before it's too late. Fred, we should listen to the man. I know ye be here, you scurvy coward. Ye escaped me once but not a second time will ye hide... ...from the fury of Captain Skunkbeard. Let me go. Let... Let me go, I tell... Watch my knee. Mom, Pop. Don't worry. I'll save you! All right. Now it's parental. No stinking ghost pirates can mess with the Jones family and get away with it. Don't worry, Freddy, we'll help you save your parents. You mean, face horrible, scary, green-eyed, glowing, ghost pirates? Do we at least get a Scooby Snack? Shaggy. Oh, you're right, Scoob. Maybe just one snack? We did miss dinner. Where is everybody? Like, they vanished. Just like my crew. And now my parents are gone. You know, I bet if we find Fred's parents, we'll find the others too. Then let's go squash some buckles. - What did he say? - It's Fred-speak. For "Let's get them." Okay, Mr. "Apple-stenographer," which way? You don't have to be an astrocartographer... ...to see that they went thataway. - Full steam ahead. - Aye, aye, captain. You sure you know how to drive this thing? Sure. It's just like the Mystery Machine. Only bigger and more "floaty." Yeah, I got it now. We're cruising. Check it out, Scoob. Like, I'm king of the world. Me too. Creepy fog, dead ahead. Freddy, so, what's our plan? Well, I'm gonna ram them. Avast, ye mateys. Our captain speaks. Tonight, me hearties, we are on the verge of greatness. When the tide is nigh, we will unleash the powers of The Heavens' Light. We will open the portals to times past. We will once again travel the seas of yore. - What is he talking about? - We will regain our lost treasures. And reign supreme over the seas. You people are crazy. Where's my wife? There is only one person who holds the key to our destiny. Oh, no. This can't be good. This scurvy dog can lead us to the location of The Heavens' Light. If we can only get him to spill the fish. - I keep telling you... - Belay that jabbering, you bilge rat. Buckoes, what should we do to the lily-livered landlubber... ...who stands in my... In our way to greatness? - Keelhaul him. - Tar and feather him. - Let him go. - Yeah. - Make him walk the plank. - Aye. Now, there's an idea. Matey, who be ye that brings forth such a brilliant and "piratey" suggestion? It be I, captain. Sea Salt Sally. I demand to know what you've done with my wife. Shut your trap, you scurvy dog, before I shuts it for ye. Oh, Scooby-Doo, where are you? Ship ahoy. In chase at a timely clip, sir. It's Freddy. Handsomely now, men, to your battle stations. - We're under attack. - Pirates. Follow me. No, Freddy! You, Sea Salt Sally, get him ready to walk the plank. Aye, aye, captain. Tell me what you've done with my wife. I demand to know where she... Whoever that poor woman is, she'll be thanking me for this. - Now what? - We can't just bob here like shark bait. - Shark bait? - Shark bait? I can't believe I'm saying this... ...but I sure wish those ghost pirates would come back. You smell that, Scoob? Yeah, coconuts. - And bananas. - Oh, no. They've lost it. Actually, I think they may have found it. - Coconuts and bananas are found where? - On my mom's head. - No. Land. - Like, all aboard the Scooby train. Next stop: Land. Good idea. If we're gonna rescue my parents and the others... ...we have to find a way off this island. - We could build a raft. We can't go back out on the ocean without food and water. Great idea. You guys start on the raft. Scoob and I will go banana hunting. We haven't eaten in so long, I can't remember what food tastes like. Me neither. Look at you, Scoob. You've gone bananas. Look, Scoob. Bananas. - Yummy. - Yummy. - Hey, guys. - Like, how did you get here? We took the stairs. - What did you do, Scooby-Doo? - Maybe save the day. Good job, Scooby. Like, why couldn't you have stumbled onto a five-star hotel? Sorry. - I can't see a thing. - Shaggy, what are you doing? Feeling for a light switch. This cave is thousands of years old. There's no light switch. - I stand corrected. - My ship. I thought she was lost forever. The ghost pirates must've brought the Galaxy Gazer... ...back to this cave for some reason. - It's gone. - What? - My antique painting. Is it valuable? Only to someone who studies the stars. It was a painting of the night sky over the Bermuda Triangle 200 years ago. What would ghost pirates want with an old painting of stars? Guys. Looks like we have some uninvited guests to our secret lair. Ye will wish ye had gone down with your ship. Prepare to suffer the wrath of Captain Skunkbeard. Like, can I get a rain check? Seize them! Make way for the captain. - Pop! - Oh, Freddy. - Where's Mom? - Stow it, ye scurvy pup. My painting. Your painting? Methinks we have the wrong man. At last, the man who will lead me to that which I seek. You're coming with me. Mr. Jones, what does he want with Rupert? Beats me. But I know one thing: These pirates have no idea where they're going. They kept asking me for directions. But, Pop, you get lost on the way to the bathroom. That's what I told them. That crazy old pirate kept showing me a painting... ...and asking me to take them to that spot in the ocean. I said, "What do you think I am, some kind of 'Afro-photographer'?" - That's, astrocartographer. - So that's why they want Rupert. The stars in the painting must be some kind of map. - But a map to where? - Hopefully away from this creepy fog. Yeah. Look, someone's coming to rescue us. It can't be. Nobody flies planes like that anymore. Aye, the Phantoms of the Triangle surface, trying to frighten us away. We must be getting close. The Cyclops? That ship's been missing more than 100 years. So I guess they won't be saving us. We must be going into the heart of the Bermuda Triangle. Be hearty, me mateys. This is our moment of truth. Yo, ho. Yo... We've got to do something. Never underestimate the power of platinum. - Voil. - We have to find the other captives. - Do you know where they are, Pop? - Shucks... ...I haven't seen anyone but the ghost pirates. - They must be below deck. - This way. After tonight, we will achieve what other men have only dreamed of: - We will travel through time. - What? At the center we will find The Heavens' Light... ...which fell to earth centuries ago. Do you mean a meteor? The Heavens' Light is the source of the Triangle's amazing power. After tonight, the power will be mine. - But there is no pow... - Silence! The captain speaks. Once I have The Heavens' Light in me hands... ...I will be able to leap through time. The waves of years past... ...will once again belong to Captain Skunkbeard. - You people are insane. - Belay the yapping, ye bilge-sucking cur. And tell me, be this the exact spot where the painting was made? We're almost there. There's Rigel, Betelgeuse and Polaris. And it is exactly 22:22 hours. The tide is at its lowest. But there's nothing out here. Just hundreds of miles of open sea. Land ho! But that's impossible. Furl the mainsail. Here's our chance. Let's go find the others. Hey, what's in here? Why would Captain Skunkbeard believe he can time-travel? It doesn't make sense. If you ask me, that guy is a few doubloons short of a treasure. I don't understand. What is all this stuff? It looks like a Bermuda Triangle museum. Who would want a crazy collection like this? They look like Captain Skunkbeard's Phantoms of the Bermuda Triangle. That's exactly what they are. Remote-control models... ...designed to look full-size from a distance... ...when projected as holograms through this projector. Brilliant. You're glowing, Scoob. That's probably what made the water glow. Someone wants to make sure... ...the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle looks real. But why? Who are they trying to fool? I don't know. But if we're gonna find my mom and the others... ...we're gonna need a plan. - That's my boy. We have to change course. We're gonna crash into those rocks. Steady as she goes, Mr. Wally. Are you crazy, man? We'll all be killed? Steady as she goes. Finally, The Heavens' Light shall be mine. Yes. Release the claw. Now, raise The Heavens' Light from the briny deep. Put your backs into it, boys... ...for the mighty Captain Skunkbeard. - It won't be long now, Mr. Wally. - Aye, captain. Finally. I can't believe it. The Heavens' Light. Wha...? What's happening? It worked. Time itself has become undone. But it can't be. I didn't... All my life I've waited for this moment. Arrogant humans. You are too small and weak for the power of The Heavens' Light. Return it to the sea and release your captives, or pay the consequences. But The Heavens' Light is mine. I command its powers. You can't handle its powers. Do not meddle with the fabric of space and time. No, I won't back down. Like, keep an eye out for the signal, Scoob. Aye, aye. Methinks there's something fishy around here. Don't change the subject, human. If you don't release your prisoners and return The Heavens' Light... ...to the Bermuda Triangle, really bad things... ...will come for... To pass. - Ye aliens favor some meddling kids. - Yeah, we get that a lot. Jinkies. We've been hit. - Like, that could have gone better. - You think? So trying to spring a trap, are ye? We come in peace? Seize them. Like, yo, ho, ho. Ahoy, you mangy marauders. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo to the rescue. That's one pirate ride I won't be standing in line for. Captain Skunkbeard, your jib is up. Nice work, guys. - Shiver me timbers and, like... - Yo, ho, ho. - But who was behind all this madness? - I think I know. Biff Wellington, of course. - He was after the meteor all this time. - But he needed Rupert to find it. But why go to all that trouble for a meteor? All my life, I was fascinated with pirates. The meteor would give me the power to control the Triangle and time travel. Then I, Captain Skunkbeard, could take my rightful place... ...among the great pirates of yore. Like, that's nuts, man. Mr. Wellington, where on earth did you get such a crazy idea? From me. Mr. Mysterio? It was the only way I could get him to finance a search for the meteor. I convinced him that he was the reincarnation of a famous pirate. You mean I'm not? So you used remote-control vessels that you projected as holograms... ...to fool Mr. Wellington into believing... ...that the legends of the Triangle were true. And I'll get away with it in spite of you meddling swabbies. But why do you want the meteor so badly? It wasn't called The Heavens' Light for nothing. It's solid gold. And it makes me richer than you, Wellington. Now I will be the true master of the sea. - Like, I'm getting seasick. - Me too. What's going on? Raising the meteor has triggered some sort of volcanic activity. It's the Triangle, you fools. She wants her meteor back. As crazy as that sounds, he's probably right. We've gotta dump that rock. No. Like, bad idea, man. We've gotta get out of here. Fred, do something. That was close. Good driving, Fred. A guy's gotta do what a guy's gotta do. - Looks like the island is lost forever. - And the meteor too. Now, let's find my parents. Sunny St. Cloud? And Captain Crothers. My crew? I can't believe that everyone on the ship was involved in the conspiracy. They weren't, at least not consciously. - Like, huh? - But I don't understand. Woodenleg Wally, a.k.a. Mr. Mysterio... ...hypnotized everyone on the ship to think they were pirates. He used them to aid him in his greedy plan. And it was working until you came along. - But where are my parents? - Jinkies. Look, Fred. A dead man tells no tales. It's time to send ye down to Davy Jones's locker. Oh, please, I really don't make very good fish food. - Avast, ye treacherous, lying scoundrel. - Stop! - Don't come any closer. - Mrs. Pirate, ma'am, please. - Release them from your spell. - Why should I? Alazamboozle. - Mom? - Skip. Come in from out there. You could fall off. Peggy? Don't move. We have to do something quick. Scooby. - Mom. Pop. - Oh, thank you, hon. I'm so proud. Well, looks like we had a mystery cruise after all. According to my calculations, if we keep this direction... ...we'll be back in Miami in no time. - And right on schedule. - I've contacted the authorities in Miami. They'll pick up those two pirates when we arrive. What a trip. Wait until your next birthday, Freddy. Like, how about some nice, safe cake and ice cream? Are you sure? Wouldn't you like a nice ski trip to the Himalayas? And risk a run-in with the abominable snowman? Forget it. Take us home, captain. Yo, ho, ho, and Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
