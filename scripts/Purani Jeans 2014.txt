Good. Very good. Write. My first song would be.. "Our friendship was like old jeans." "But your friendship.." "But your friendship.." "Yanked the string out of my pants." A new poet has come. Hey beautiful nun. Sam. You here? I haven't seen you for a while. Missed me? Anyway, what did you wish for? Someone told me that.. ..if I light a candle here I'll be blessed with true love. So I just.. Really? - Yes. Well, if that's true then.. ..I should light a candle too, right? I never imagined you're the 'church type'. That's an insult to Saint Samuel. I come here once a year to say thank you. Oh...how could I forget? Happy Birthday. - Thank you. By the way, what did you wish for? Oh my God, Sam. Why did you do that? Relax, it's okay. It's absolutely okay. I did sterilize the blade before I did this. Anyway, the party starts at 8. And if you come.. ..my birthday will be all the more special. Oh, God! Jesus. My sugar-syrup! Look what I stole from papa's room. Condom. You pack bullets with your gun. You didn't get it? What if things get hot between me and Roxy.. ..at Sam's birthday party? Things get hot! She'll find me hot. Take a look in the mirror. - Forget it. Mom says in these glasses.. ..I look like Shahrukh from 'Baazigar'. You need 'Complan' not condoms. Then you keep it, Bobby. Get lost. Real men are into real things. Real? What? Children, what's up? Hello, uncle. - Hello, son. Listen. - Yes. Did you go into my room yesterday? My stuff's missing. What stuff, papa? Don't touch my things. Stupid. - Papa, I'm going. It's Sam's birthday. I've to buy a gift for him. - Where are you going? And the decorations.. Goodbye, papa. God bless. - You're taking the scooter. I need to make deliveries. Stupid fool. You fools, you think it's funny. Let's go. Uncle, your stuff's lying on the ground. How did this get here? Oh no, it's closed again. Just wait for a while. The bakery will reopen. Hi. - Hi. Where have you been the past few days? You weren't at your secret spot either. Actually, I was busy organizing Sam's birthday. He's throwing a party today. You're invited too. I don't think I'll come. - Why? It's just that Sam's a bit crazy. You have to come. You love the chocolate pastries.. ..from this bakery, don't you. Come to the party and I'll treat you. But only if the bakery opens. Kasauli's really a dormant city. Dormant men. Closed shops. Look...even the clock on that tower's not working. Time's stopped...because you're here. What? - Nothing. The bakery's opened up. Come on. Bobby, I need to say something urgent.. ..at the party, okay. Fine, fine. By the way, I got you something from Chandigarh. God, you're crazy. Shut up, okay. It's serious, and you.. Listen, sister's here... I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye-bye. Hello. - Hey, sister. When did you come back from the church? Just now. - Cool. By the way...aren't you getting to close to this Bobby? Oh sister, please, I am already quite stressed out. Just not in the mood for lecture, okay. So just forget it. You won't get it. Those two are already crazy about you. And...you're so mature. Forget it. Listen. Wear these earrings. They will match your red-party theme. Superb. Love you. Are you sure you're not coming to the party? Yes, I am sure. By the way, which one do you like? I mean...I really like Sam. He's so cool. But I know you... you must have fallen for that.. ..intense poet.. - Get out of here. Hey, I am wearing your red sandals, okay. 'Intense poet type.' I like that. Thank God you're coming along. Now I just hope this moped starts up. Even it doesn't want me to go to the party. What's your problem? - Sam. How many times do I tell you? Sam flirts with every girl. But he's a sweet harmless guy, okay. And...I don't think this moped's going to start today. Is it okay if we walk? - Yes, I like walking. Sure. - Yes. Fine, then I'll leave my moped here tonight. Come on. Wow, look at that. It's so beautiful. Wow. "Her laugh...the fragrance." "I still remember it." "First love...always stays fragrant in your mind.." "..I wonder why?" You've to tell him about us today. Please. Fine, I'll tell him. What's the big deal? It's a big deal for me. For my sake. Please. Come on, Cowboys, party. Cheers. Hi, Sam, happy birthday. Thank you. Thank you so much. You're looking very, very pretty tonight. Excuse me. Brother! - Happy birthday, dear. Where were you? - On the way. Retro guitar, it had to be your idea. I know a bit about your taste too. Come on, let's drink. How are you, Bahadur? - First class. Happy birthday. Alpha Beta Gama Theta. Only the beautiful triumphs. Who's going to make some noise? Kasauli Cowboys! Idiot...you're drunk. Don't stop me tonight. My night. Baby. Baby. - What? Either kiss me or dance him. Forget this. Dance me baby. Kiss me baby. - No, no. Kiss me. Kiss me. - Come here. Dance me. What the.. I meant my cheeks, but she had me tongue-tied.. I had to tell you something important. I had to tell you something important. - Tell me. About Nayantara. Yes. Something about her. Whenever I see her...my whole world lights up. I think I am in love, Siddi boy. I think I am in love. What were you saying? - Nothing. Happy birthday. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Sam. Listen, Bobby, I have to tell you.. ..and it's really serious. I've been trying to tell you, but you don't listen. Come on, babes. No serious talks tonight. Only party...and dance. Come on. Come here. Bobby, this is not funny. Listen to me. Chill out. Smile. A dance with the most beautiful girl in the party. I am fine. Come on. Sam, I am fine. - Come and dance with me. I am fine. You're my favorite girl, come here. I am fine, Sam. - Come on. I think you look so hot in this dress. Too beautiful.. Baby, let's kiss. Sam, what are you doing? What happened? - What's your problem? Sam. Get up. Get up, it's okay. Nayantara. Get a grip on yourself. What happened? Ask your best friend. Sid. Let her go. She's a bloody tease. If I say something.. ..you'll come up with a thousand excuses. And did you tell him about us? Sid, let her go. Let her go. I knew it. Go to hell. Sid, come back now. Sid. Come back, Sid. That day fate was asking me.. ..whether I wanted love... or friendship. But I couldn't decide. Maybe I was a coward... or maybe just confused. By the way, where in Kasauli are you heading? Lawrence Estate. Sam. Sam. Listen. - Yes. I just received my MIT interview call. I have to leave for Delhi today. Congrats, ma. - Thanks. Oh my head. This hangover is killing me. By the way, I had to talk to you about something important. About last night.. About Nayantara. Yes. I was so stupid. I shouldn't have such things. I will apologize to her.. ..but let me sleep not, Sid. Please. Goodnight. Where are you going? Go back to sleep. What sleep? She's called 15 times this morning. Aisha. Aisha? - Yes. Tell her I am not here. Hello, Aisha. He's saying he isn't here. - You.. I mean...I mean.. He.. Give it to me. Bloody idiot. Hello, Aisha. Siddharth here. Can I speak to Nayantara? Hello. She hung up. That's girls for you. I'll leave too. Go home. - Come on. She's really troubled me a lot. I wonder what she wants. Let's go. N...I am really sorry for last night. Beautiful nun, can you please forgive me? Yeah! Look, I can't help you. Okay. Keep this.. Keep this money and just get it done somewhere. I don't want your stupid money, okay. I thought you would come along. I am not going anywhere. - Bobby. Bobby, please listen. Bobby, I haven't even told my sister yet. God. Just if we had used protection that day. Look...how long have we known each other? Three months. And how can I be sure whether it's me.. ..or someone else. Maybe someone back in Mumbai. What? Just.. How dare you? You.. Don't try that again, get it. Bobby, what are you doing? Stay away from this, Sam. And she's not nave. And I didn't rape her, okay. She came to me willingly. Oh, God! And what do you care? Are you having an affair with her? - Bobby. Stop it! Stop it, please. Stop it, both of you. - Get the hell out of here. Get out. - Fine. I'm not too keen on staying here either. Here's...your Zippo. To hell with you and your friendship. Just get out. I'll never see your face again! Oh, God! It's all over. It's all over. And then Sam handled everything. He took Aisha to an abortion clinic close to Kasauli. He helped her like a responsible brother. Sister, I am scared. It was suddenly as if he grew up that summer. And then Nayantara's view towards him changed. She saw that Sam's a true friend.. ..who helped them in desperate times. By the time I returned from the interview.. ..much had changed. Aisha, didn't you get the joke? Santa went for the interview on a Sunday. He's telling you the 'Egg' joke. Santa.. Here. - Thank you. Siddhu. When did you return? Today morning. How are you? - How are you? Did Sam tell you on the phone? - Yes, he did. Bobby ran away. - I know. Just a second. Hi, Aisha. Sorry I wasn't here. Aisha, don't worry. Everything will be fine, okay. I don't understand. Why me? Have some water. We're with you. If it wasn't for Sam.. ..I can't imagine what would've happened. Where is he? - He's in the shed. I'll go meet him. I didn't get a chance to say this before. No one does what you did. I am sorry. I...misjudged you. It's really okay. Even I am ashamed for my behavior.. ..on the night of the party. Really sorry. I was an idiot. I just wanted to say that I.. I.. - I love you too, beautiful nun. I am so happy for us. Sid, you're back. You're back. I am back, Sam. I am back. But I took too long. Losing you will be the biggest grief of my life. Billo, stop the car. Stop. Siddharth sir, stop the car. What happened? Siddharth sir, come. Myself Bunty. It's nice to finally meet you. I sent the car for you. I thought you would come home. But then I learnt that you went straight to the estate.. Yes, I was just returning from Lawrence Estate.. Yes, your mother. She used to talk a lot about you. I used to handle all her matters after you. You asked me to arrange for a priest. I've done that. Just freshen up.. ..and then I'll get the priest whenever you want. So let's ride on the back of my scooter. No, I'll take the car. Fresh air. - No, I'll take the car. Thank you so much. - Fine, as you wish. After returning to Kasauli.. ..I could still smell the old memories in the air. Suddenly it felt like.. ..those voices were calling me. 'Sam!' 'Is this the way?' 'Why?' 'Even Romeo came through the window..' '..to meet his Juliet.' 'No one ever stopped him.' Each day in Kasauli was like celebration time. I never thought the day would come.. ..when that world would fade away. I was just checking.. ..you didn't bring aunt's death certificate along. You know she died in New York. Why didn't you tell me? Look sir, we'll find a way out.. ..if we don't have her death certificate. Let's do one thing. Let's ask a high-court lawyer.. ..to make an affidavit. It'll take around 8-10 days. - 10 days? Yes. Bunty, I don't have 10 days. I am leaving. Not again. Why are you always in a hurry? Can I say something, don't mind? You mother built this property.. ..with such love and care. So sell it to someone worthy. So that her soul rests in peace too. Right? Just a thought. Fine. 7 days. But no more. Okay? - Okay, sir. I'll get your work done.. ..before the water and food here gets to you. Bunty, can I please have my hand back? Of course, it's all yours. Keep it. There used to be a music store here. - It still is. Two-in-one. Music store on the inside and caf outside. Sometimes he changes according to his mood. Sometimes the music store comes out.. ..and the caf goes in. 'Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas'! 'It's one of my favorite songs.' 'With time the ink on the pages fades away.' 'But what about the memories etched on the heart..' '..that torments you every day." Yo, Siddi boy. Look. This is how you shave. See what you did? Now I'll have this scar all my life. Girls are crazy about scars, Sam. Idiot...at least this way you won't forget me. Now stop crying, come here. 'I'll always remember you Sam.' 'The wound of losing you...will never heal.' I am talking about Lawrence Estate. Please ask them to find Sherry Lawrence. - Yes, sir. Thank you. It's not here. I searched all the records. But there's no clue about any Sherry Lawrence. All that hard work for nothing. Tell me something. - Yes. Why are you after that particular woman? Can't you manage with someone else? Bunty, thank you. You're welcome. Bunty. - Yes. The watch on the clock tower's stopped? It's always been like that. I never saw it work for ages. Some old connection. Bunty, please. Mind your own business. I hope this week my work gets done in Chandigarh. Just hold this. I told you I'll get your job done in a week. Just wait. Mister.. Closed. - Darn it! What happened? Lunch! - What lunch? It means lunch-time. What nonsense. - Come after 2pm. Where's their office? Their complain office? The complaint office must be closed for lunch too. What nonsense. This is ridiculous. This is why I didn't want to come back. Nothing has bloody changed over here. Brother, I have an idea. - So stupid. Let's go have lunch. I don't want to eat anything, Bunty. It's an A-1 restaurant. You'll be licking your fingers. Take my advice. Here's your briefcase. - Yes, it's my briefcase. Come on. The food's really good. Come on. I must admit, Bunty, this fritter's really good. You know.. It feels like I've tasted this before. It's very delicious. My God. And this sweetmeat. These guys really know my taste. There's lot more we know about you. Would you like to know? Oh my God! Tino! After so many years. You look just like a Sikh! It's the Lord's grace. Won't you give me a hug? - Of course. How are you? - Fit. Suit and all. Looking like an NRI.. George Clooney. Grandma always wanted to see you wearing a turban. You remember? - Of course I do. After she passed away.. ..I decided I'll be a good boy. But you turned out to be a bad man. You didn't call to say you're in Kasauli. That's why I had to devise this scheme with Bunty. Thank you, Bunty. - Welcome, sir. Shall I get you more fritters? - Of course. I see. Now I get your idea of coming to the restaurant. You've to stay here for the evening. There's a big party. We'll sip whiskeys, eat kebabs. Actually, I've to go back to the court, so I.. What court? The court closes down here at five. Don't worry about me. I'll catch a bus. Would you like to meet your sister-in-law? Yes, of course. She's right here. Mrs. Kathuria, where are you? Come here. Walk faster. Roxy. - Hello. How are you? My, God! Little Tino. - Hi. Friends Forever? Yo! It looks like someone's wedding party. I am not comfortable. So what? Everyone's invited to the wedding. You go ahead, I.. - Come on. Calm down, come on. Roxy.. - It's okay. Go on. Go play with Parmeet. Mummy's coming. I am not invited. Relax. Especially in an old friend's wedding.. ..everyone's invited. Suzy! - Yes. Suzy! How are you man? - I am fine. How are you? - Just fine. This is your party? - Yes. I got married last year. - What are you saying? Congratulations. - Thanks. This is just a small reception. Come on. Come in. Sure, let's go. How was my surprise? - Superb, Tino. Really superb. You want to know something else? - What? He's my business partner as well. What? We're even expanding to USA now. Well...it's good to see.. ..at least some Cowboys maintained their friendship. Anyway, so tell me... who's the bride? Bride actually.. She's a blondie. What are you saying? We went to Canada on his honeymoon. I found Roxy's cousin. And we fell in love. Sorry, Siddhu, but we still love blondies. You're just.. Forget it. Where is she? Introduce me. Look. Come on, brother. Everybody's waiting for you on the dance floor. Let's get on the dance floor. Yes, the in-laws are waiting. Come on. You wait. Someone's waiting for you here. Turn around. Hi, Siddharth. - Nayantara. We're meeting after so many years. Won't you say hello? Hello. Hi. I never imagined... we'll meet after so many years. Tino and Suzy, we kept in touch. Nice to see you. - Yeah. Same here. Do you stay in Chandigarh? - No. Delhi. - I see. But I am working on the design of a hotel in Kasauli. Oh...so you became an architect after all. Nice. - Yes. How's Aisha? Aisha's in Singapore. She's married to a banker now. - Oh. You know...you look just the same. Anyway, you want to dance? Sure. 'I never imagined... after all these years...we'll meet again.' You know, Siddharth.. ..sometimes we should just forget the past and move on. But I can't. Sam's death changed it all... forever. How can I forget... that I betrayed my best friend? Maybe life betrayed him, not you. Maybe you're right. I wish I could meet Sam's mom. I told you...one day I'll treat everyone to Scotch. Cheers. Cheers. - Cheers, buddy. Siddhu. You really disappointed me. I thought after Sam's death.. ..you will look after us. But you fled yourself. Forget it. Forget the past.. You're drunk.. - I am not drunk. I am.. - It's okay. I couldn't say anything. I remember every moment of that summer. Everything changed after that. Sid, you're back. Come in, come in. How was the interview? - I am through. I've to leave for US next week. Wow! Congrats, man. - Thanks. I am so happy for you. Aren't you going to wish him or something? Guys, guys, guys. Sid's going to America. He's through. Congrats. Siddharth. Let's party. Sid! Sid! Sid! Sid! Come out. Now he will study with foreign girls. Lift him up! Lift him up! Hip hip hurray! You are going to America.. ..and didn't think it was important to tell me? Everything happened so soon that.. Anyways, what's the point in telling you now? Everything has changed. What? It was all clear at the shed. You're mistaken, Siddharth. Look...after what he did for Aisha.. I don't love Sam.. - I can understand that you.. I don't.. - Look...there's no point discussing about it. Anyway, I am going to America next week. There's no point hurting anyone. Let us all part as friends. Goodbye. And after that evening.. ..everything changed between me and Nayantara. I was just counting my days.. ..for going to America. Bahadur. - Yes, Sam sir. Give him the red jacket too. - Yes. Enough, Sam, my suitcase will explode. Let me. And...your farewell party's day after. I hope you remember that. I remember. I've to go now. I still have lots of packing to do at home. Thanks, Bahadur. Your phone is ringing. - Someone will answer it. Thanks for the clothes. No problem. Why are you ruining the jeans? Once it's ready you will know how special they are. The phone's been ringing for so long. Answer it. I'll take this. Siddhu sir...I'll get you a bag. - Thanks, Bahadur. Hello. - Hello, Abhijeet. Dr. Goyal's reports have arrived. The reports are negative. You're not going to be a father after all. Excuse me. - What happened? Aren't you happy? What happened? Is your wife around? It's me Sunita. From the Delhi office. What's wrong with you? Who was it? - Nothing. Wrong number. Leave now. Hey nice. It suits you. When were you going to talk about her to mom? About whom? Abhijeet, stop pretending. You very well know I am talking about Sunita. Sunita? Sunita.. Sunita's the secretary at my Delhi office. So? - Come on. Listen, don't take me for a fool. Don't you try and fool me. Here's the cheque for your tuition fees. You do your work and let me do mine. Go on. Listen to me. Either you talk to mom or I do. No matter how much one does for cheapsters like you.. ..it's never enough. You fool. Learn to behave. I am like a father to you. You.. What are you doing? - Sam! Sherry. - Sam, stop it. Better tell him. What are you doing, Sam? Why don't you ask your husband? He's the fool, I am telling you. I've just had enough of this, Sam. Apologies. I said apologies. Mom, take my advice.. ..and leave him before he ruins us. I don't need your advice. You don't need me either, mom. Sam! Sam! Sam sir.. The tickets will be ready tomorrow. Go and collect it. Mom, my farewell party's the day after. How many things are you going to make me do before I go? Come to Chandigarh with me. No, son. New nursery batches. Children. Flower orders. I can't come. You go. What happened? Mrs. Monica Ray, you are very bad with goodbye you know that. Look at me. Look at me. - No. No crying. Siddhu! I am going to miss you. - Miss you too, mom. Look after yourself. Go, take a look. - Going. Go. Siddhu, open the door. - You two. What are you two doing here? How are you? We just came to say bye. How are you, Suzy? - How are you? Come in. Come, let's sit. Here. A farewell gift from us. It's the most expensive pen from the Novelty Store. You like writing, don't you? - Thanks. Siddhu. Now you're leaving too. Our group's slowly breaking up. Why will it break up? Sam and I will visit every year. And you two will go to the University as well. The Cowboys will have a reunion in summers. Okay? Yes, bro, I'll go to the Busa institute. And if he doesn't succeed in medical.. ..I'll take him along with me to Delhi. All the best. - But, Siddhu. You know something. It won't be the same without you and Sam. By the way, we'll need to.. ..prepone my farewell party. Actually I've to go to Chandigarh.. ..to collect my passport and visa, so.. No problem. Just tell Sam. He's making all the arrangements. We met in the morning. But he isn't answering his phone now. I wonder where he is. Then go to his house. Yes, good idea. Sam. Sam! What are you doing? What's wrong with you? Sam. What happened? No, Sid. Just leave. - Sam. Listen, won't you tell me? What's wrong with you? Do you know...what's the most overrated emotion in the world? It's love. Because some day it shatters. I was just six when.. ..father eloped to Paris with that Catherine. He never looked back. Parent's love is like the rain, man. It's not like that. Come on. Forget about all this. okay? Sometimes I feel that.. ..everyone's my friend because I do things for them. Do you think anyone genuinely loves me? Do you think even Nayantara loves me? Everybody loves you. We're your friends. We're always there for you. I am always there for you. Okay. Now get up. Get up. That's my boy. Come on. Thanks, man. - Anytime. Friends Forever. Sorry, sorry, sorry. - It's okay. 'I had no idea what was going on in Sam's personal life.' 'He never discussed this aspect of his life with anyone.' Sam. Careful. M. 'Except...maybe for my mother.' How did you know it was me? Mothers always know. Well, if you're thinking of starting a rock band.. ..then you need to take care of that voice. Coffee? - Yes, of course. Hold this. I'll get another candle. Sam! What happened? Do you see someone's face in this mug? Speak up. M. Whenever I come here.. ..I fear what I am missing out on. I wonder what happens to mom. First her drinking... and now this...Abhijeet. Why did she have to marry him, M? It's okay. It's all a part of growing up. Okay, son. Then, M, I don't want to grow up. Give me a big hug. Power's back. You two...flirting again. By the way...what's my part in your love story? You're the villain. Now get out. When I last checked this was my house. Come on. Let's make coffee. Hey...this is my house. What you guys say.. - Friends forever. Yes! Goodnight, Sam. - Goodnight, M. Adios amigo. - Bye. Siddhu. Can I say something? - Yes. Don't ever hurt Sam's feelings. Don't worry, mom, Sam's my best friend. And nothing can ever change that, okay. I know. By the way, he's throwing a farewell party for me tomorrow. Only the best for my favorite Cowboy. Thanks. Shampoo. You all did so much for me. Shampoo. Seriously. Thanks. I've written a small poem dedicated to all of you. Go for it. "Each day they'll call out." "They'll scream and shout." "We'll never forget... these good old days." Sing it. I can't sing. - There's always a first time. Come on. "These fun filled good old days." "The carefree good old days." "We'll never forget... these good old days." Good song. I like it. Not bad. "These good old days." "Those carefree days." "Those sweet-intoxicating days." "We'll never forget... these good old days." "We never realized.." "..how soon these days went by." "Why do all these moments of happiness.." "..pass away so rapidly?" "The heart says... don't let this ambience pass-away." "The days filled with promises to live." "Days filled with tall expectations." "We'll never forget... these good old days." "I wish these days would last." "They always go too fast." "Some things you wished would stay the same." "The magic that we share." "I feel it in the air." "Why do you have to go away?" "Happiness in the eyes...and some tears too." "The ambience is emotional. "It's not easy to say goodbye to our dear friends." She's fine. Nayantara.. Aisha. - Are you okay? What's wrong? - Sorry, Aisha. I made you cry. It's okay, Sid. It's not your fault. Sister, I want to go home. - Are you okay? Yes. You stay, you've come out after a long time. You stay. Yes, Nayantara, I'll just drop her and come back. I'll come too. - No, no, it's okay. I'll just be back. Sure? - It's okay. Any news about Bobby? Aisha. I don't think Bobby's going to come back. You know it's best to forget him and move on. Yeah. I know. - Hey, you okay? Fine. Whose gift is that.. Oh no...that's Sid's farewell gift. I forgot to give it to him. I think it's going to rain. Rain and champagne. Wow...it's going to be fun. Where's your sister-in-law? - My sister-in-law or yours? Don't spoil my mood, Suzy. What did we decide on Sam's birthday? One who gets kissed gets the miss. Come on. Friends Forever. Sam, Siddhu and you are close friends, right? Best friends since we were five. And there's nothing to let us change that. Where's everyone? Siddharth. Where's everyone, Siddhu? Siddhu. Siddhu. - Nayantara. I just wanted to tell you one thing that day. I hate you. I really-really hate you. - But.. I hate you, just go away. - Nayantara, listen to me. I don't want to meet you. Just go to America. Please. "These days my heart doesn't listen to me." "These days I've lost my heart." "It wishes to see you only." "It talks about you only." "Are you the one?" "Are you the same?" "Are you the one?" "Are you the same?" "These days my heart doesn't listen to me." "These days I've lost my heart." "Okay, now where's everyone?" "Silly boy, where are you?" Sam! Sam! Sam, listen. Sam, I am sorry. I am really, really sorry. - Shut up. After all that all you have to say is 'sorry' to me. Wow, man. Everyone should have a best friend like you. Look, Sam. I always wanted to tell you.. ..about me and Nayantara. I tried but.. - But what? You were tongue-tied. Or you thought Sam's so stupid he'll never know. No. It's just that I brought it up at the wrong moment.. I never got the chance. No, Sid. - And then everything had changed.. ..when I came back from the interview. Please. You had many opportunities, Sid. And you know it. Look. I made a big mistake not telling you. I am fine with any punishment you give me. Please. Please. Please. Please. Sam, forgive me. Please. I want us to stop being friends. Look, Sam, you're angry. Don't breakup our 16 year old friendship for.. You broke this 16 year old friendship, not me. That too for a girl. That too for a girl. - Sam.. I didn't know you were serious about her. I thought you would never like a girl like Nayantara. Why? Are girls like her meant only for you? No, try to understand. You're my friend and she's my love. I was confused. "Love.. Friendship." These are just big words written in your diary. And you know nothing about them. Friendship's most important for me. I wouldn't have left her there.. ..and come here otherwise. Please. Just shut up. Just shut up. You know what, for me love is dead. - No, Sam. For me...this friendship is dead. - No, Sam. I don't care about her anymore. And I don't care about you. You know what.. I am ashamed to call you a friend. I am ashamed to call you a Kasauli Cowboy. You broke the Cowboy rules. You broke the rules of friendship. Friendship isn't made of rules, Sam. Kasauli Cowboy! Cowboy rules! What's all this? Childish rules made by you, that's it. You want to stay God.. ..and the world follows your rules. But...I am sorry, that's not done. - Shut up. Try to look from other's point of view. - Shut up! Did you ever think I might love her? Did you? - Shut up, Sid. Thank God you're leaving, Sid. Just get out of my life, man. Yes, I am going. Even I want you out of my life forever. Go. Oh, stop! I want to meet Sam. Son Sam has warned you not to enter inside. You can't go in. I'll wait here. Sam! Sam! Sam was driving like a berserk. Amidst the rain and thunder.. ..he sped up towards Devil's Point. But then... he suddenly stopped the car. I didn't know what was going on in his mind. But I could see terror on his face. Sam! No! I saw my best friend die right before my eyes. The fate was mocking our friendship. Next day Sam and I, we both left Kasauli forever. You know...till now I haven't forgiven myself. That's why...I broke all ties with Kasauli and all of you. That means... you did attend his funeral. Yes. I am sure even God must have forgiven you now. Forget it. - How can I? The other day I went to his house. It felt like all the walls were questioning me. "Where were you that night?" There were so many things he wanted to do. Visit Paris. Make a rock album. All...over. - Yeah. See. Only we three cowboys left now. Sam...died. Bobby ran away. - Forget it. Siddhu, stay in Chandigarh tonight. Yes. - No. I've to go back. I felt a strange peace meeting everyone that night. May be Nayantara was right. I should just forget the past and move on. "These days my heart doesn't listen to me." "These days, I've lost my heart." "These days my heart doesn't listen to me." Hello. Hello. "It wants to see you." "It always talks about you." You did this? Well, someone said Kasauli's a dormant city. Lazy people. Closed shops. And...the clock tower's watch too. And you...are trying to awaken this dormant city? No. If you want we... can walk together. Sure. Siddharth, there's something I wanted to say. I.. Whenever I see this place.. ..it feels like nothing has changed. I...I actually got engaged last year. It's an arranged marriage. You know...all these years.. And you never.. Anyway, see you. Nayantara. That summer.. I am sorry I ran out on you like that. Don't be, Siddharth. When two best friends love the same girl.. ..it's the girl who always loses. You never wrote or called me. Our paths are separate now, Siddharth. "It enters through your eyes." "Even if I call it, it doesn't return." "It's so nave, it tries to oppose the society." Hi. Hi, Siddharth. Sorry for last night. - It's okay. Your behavior was justified. But, Nayantara, I just wanted to tell you one thing. What? In these 12 years... I missed you every day. Every moment. These are few letters that I wrote to you. "These days, heart.." After meeting Nayantara, I realised what I have left behind. Maybe that's why I wanted to take.. ..all memories of Kasauli with me before going to America. Don't you think Bobby's different from us? You never judge friends, Siddi boy. Friends are like these guitar strings. Once the tuning's done. Every string is important. See. Excuse me. Major. Balwinder Shekhawat. - Yes? I've something that belongs to you. Siddhu! Come on. How are you? - How are you? I am fine. You look fit, Bobby. Nice. Here. I think this belongs to you. Lighter. Where did you find it? At the shed. Cowboy shed. Do you remember? - I do. But how did you find me? You're a Kargil war hero. I typed your name.. ..and it directed me to the Army site. And then here. Did you ever go back to Kasauli? - No. Since I ran away from Kasauli.. ..I've been running. First Delhi, then the defense academy. After that Kargil. You know, Siddhu. Whenever I look back... I think I was such a selfish. I should've been there for her Aisha. I really want to say sorry to her. Whenever I meet her. Don't worry. Eventually we find a way, right. Don't worry. Thank God Sam handled everything. - I know. You know Sam was the true hero. That he was. Sam was a hero to all of us. You know...maybe we Cowboys should meet in Kasuali. 'Sam would've done It had he been alive.' Hello, Bunty. - Hello. Sorry for calling at this late hour. - No, it's okay. Actually, I want to rethink my decision.. ..about selling this cottage. I know you've worked really hard. Don't worry, I will definitely compensate you. Ma'am. - Yes. Someone here to see you. And you asked for this file. - Okay. Yes. - Thank you. Hi, Nayantara. All set to go back then? Yeah. Sort off. You know...I feel that.. ..I'm being a bit hasty by doing this. Having second thoughts? Yeah. About everything. I think I've fallen back in love with Kasauli. By the way, Siddhu. I got something for you. The other day you said that.. ..you wish you could meet Sam's mom. Here. Aunt Sherry's address. But how? I've been trying so hard to find her. Thank you, Nayantara. Siddhu sir. Hello, Bahadur. Who is it? - Madam. It's Sam's friend Siddhu. Hi, aunt. I was expecting you a lot earlier. Come sit. Thank you. Actually, aunt... I was trying to meet you.. ..for a long time. All these years I just wanted to tell you.. ..that I am sorry. I am really sorry. If I had stopped Sam that day, then maybe.. Sam.. Sam died because of me. So you don't know what happened that night? I still remember. Sam came back home in a fit of rage. Enough. I hope that Sid burns in hell! Sam! - Bahadur. Tell the watchman not to let Sid in. Sam. Sam. Sam. - I hate that idiot. What has happened? Sid's your best friend. He was, mama. Best friends don't steal Each other's girlfriend. What? He was with Nayantara in the shed. He was sleeping with her, mama. Sam. And when I confronted him.. ..he says they love each other. But she loves me, mama. If Nayantara loves you.. ..then why is she sleeping with Sid? But I know she loves me. Come. Sit down. That day she hugged me, mama. We don't always get those we love. I've been such a fool, mom. 'A love song.' 'It's just something I scribbled.' 'I wanted to tell you something important.' 'About Nayantara.' 'Someone told me that..' '..if I light a candle here I'll be blessed with true love.' 'So I just..' 'Nothing.' 'Happy birthday.' I am the odd one out. Madam, you got a call from Delhi. Bahadur. - Yes, Sam sir. Get the gift. - Yes. Here you go. Listen. Yes. I've to give this to Sid in The morning at the station. - Yes. Change the gift wrapping paper. And slip this inside it. - Yes. Now go. Sid you fool. Love you.. Sherry, why don't you.. - Shut up, Abhijeet. You humiliated me. You cheated on me. She called. She was trying to blackmail me. She's demanding me money. I wish I knew what was going on. Look at your condition. Only when you get over your first husband.. ..you will know what's going on here. Not just me, but no man can tolerate you. Do you know that? All the time you're drunk. You stink of booze all the time. I stink? - Yes. Office, home, bedroom, bed, everywhere.. ..you stink of booze. And you stink of that... How dare you touch me? Don't touch. Don't touch me. - Why are you touching me? Don't touch her. Stay away from her. Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam...stay away. Stay out. Stay out of this please. Why? Why? Because this is my problem. Mama, since the day You brought him home.. ..he's become my problem too. Sam...please, leave me alone. Didn't you hear? - You shut up! Just go. What did I say to you? Go. Just go. - No, mama. I won't go. What will you do? Do you know what Your problem is, mama? You always think about yourself. You only see yourself. Have you ever thought about me? I've been alone since my childhood. Father left when I was just six. And instead of supporting me.. ..you got married again. You two distanced me from yourselves. First hostel, then college and then London. And you especially wanted to keep me away. Because I remind you of papa. I remind you of papa. That's why you never wanted me. Nobody's ever wanted me. Nobody needs me. Not even my friends anymore. I am all alone, mama. I am all alone. And today when a girl broke my heart.. ..instead of supporting or consoling me.. ..you're pushing me away again. You're pushing me away. You're pushing me away. You don't deserve a son. You don't deserve a son. You don't deserve anyone. You don't deserve anyone. Yes, I don't deserve anyone. I made a mistake, okay. I am trying to fix it. That's my mistake. Mistake? Every man in your life is a mistake. Papa was a mistake. Abhi is a mistake. And I am the biggest mistake of your life, mama. You're the biggest mistake of my life? You're saying this? Get out. Just get out. Go away. I will, mama. - Yes. I will go away from your life forever. Then go away. Sherry. - Why don't you go? Let him go. - Just get out of my life. 'It's not you.' 'It's me.' 'I killed my only son.' 'That night when Sam needed me the most..' '..I wasn't in my senses.' You know...the heaviest body is that of your son's. I am so sorry, aunt. I am so sorry. Your gift. Bahadur's still kept it intact. Hey, Siddi boy. So you're leaving Kasauli. You're train must be about to leave.. ..and you must be wondering.. ..what if Sam was here.. Sam's there, brother. Sam's there. For you, always. You will always be my favorite Kasauli Cowboy. I am sorry for last night. I should've seen that my best friend was in love. Forgive me. You two look beautiful together. Always stay together, okay? And this jeans, it's your farewell gift. Because our friendship is like this jeans. The older it gets, the better. I've also written a song inspired by this thought. The words are mine... but you'll compose the tune. That's all, bro. Oh, and remember Paris. I will see you there with Morrison. Friends Forever. Sam has set me free today. Not you...us. I love you. I love you too. Everyone has to come, I don't care how. It's a Cowboy's reunion. This is for Sam. "Only the fortunate find love and friends." "We grow close and touch each others heart." "Knows every smile, every tear we shed. "But one day they leave us alone." "Only the fortunate find friends." "Only the fortunate find friendship." "Friendship is delicate."

"Fortunate ones get eternal friends." "These days my heart doesn't listen to me." "These days I've lost my heart." "These days my heart doesn't listen to me." "These days I've lost my heart."

"These days I've lost my heart." "This is a new talent it has received from you." "It meets everyone with smile." "It awakens me in the middle of the nights." "And asks me why the nights don't pass." "It wishes to see you only." "It talks about you only." "Are you the one?" "Are you the same?" "Are you the one?" "Are you the same?" "These days my heart doesn't listen to me." "These days my heart.."
