He told me a couple of things. He said he loved the rose leaves. He said that person did it as well as you. Sorry, Michelle, but you and the dog, you're not so different. Except that, he licks himself. You're yucky! I brush my teeth. As well. You brush your dog's teeth? Yes. I can not stand. I feel more that way. It gets worse. It throws me to the ear. If I could you polish the molars! Stop it! It is swollen? Yes, a little. Tomorrow, I run with Willy. By the way, how are you? Do you think? He tears a few teeth file and hit the ball with Richard Gere in Florida. On the Cote d'Azur! Highly retirement! Is there anything there? Perhaps an accident. No, it looks like ... Looks like customs. Good evening. Border police. Stop the engine. Your passports. Yes, sir. Stay in the car! My passport behind in my bag. Behind in your bag? Yes. Pull gently, hands in plain view. Long night? "Adel Khalid Jalil." Sit back and lay hands on the wheel. You have nothing to declare? No, nothing. It's not laugh. What do they say? It is because of the lighthouse. I'll explain. True, the lighthouse is broken, but it struck a deer ... I speak to the driver. You are the driver? Sure, anything to declare? No, nothing. We were at a wedding near Lennoxville. We return to Portland and we have nothing to declare. What are they doing? - An identity check. - No kidding! Thank you! You know you have a broken headlight? Yes, in fact ... We hit a deer. You hit a deer? Are you sure it was a doe? It was either a doe ... Be a roebuck! I do not know the difference. You do not know the difference? You distinguish a male not a female? For example, your friend is a doe or a roebuck? Respond. A doe. And the wise guy behind? A roebuck. - And next to him? - Listen ... I think it was a doe. Where have you struck? I do not know ... How so? But you were driving. It was on the road I do not know the area well. I see. Give me your passport. He starts to piss me off! Calm down. They are quite excited like that. What was the animal? He was dead. He was dead before the incident? He died later. He died later. Get off the vehicle. All. All behind the white line! What does it mean? Mere formality. Do not worry. Still nothing to report? Currency? Valuables? So something else? Hashish, cocaine, amphetamines ... ? - Heroin? - No. And you, young man, anything to declare? My brother is dumb. It's original. Do not make fun of him. Pardon? Do your homework, but do not laugh at him. I do not care for him, I try to communicate. Sorry if I have injured you or your brother. Tell him. Pardon? Tell him I'm sorry if I have hurt. My brother is dumb not deaf. I know, but I ask you to translate. To be sure. - Have you kidnapped someone? - Pardon? Answer! No. Do you plan to an attack in our country? Do you have links with a terrorist group? Are you kidding? I do my work. If you have nothing to hide, answer: Are you related a terrorist group? Not at all! "Adel Khalid Jalil." Did you go to Bali? London? Madrid? No, never. Your passport is empty! There is new or is a fake? No, it's true. I do not understand. We want to go home, that's all. Get carried away. I do my work. This is the procedure. Stay calm, cooperate and you will leave. Okay? Are you a worshiper of Allah? That's enough! I am a lawyer. If Mr. Khalid is a "worshiper of Allah" that's his business. It is the abuse of ... He wants his Ventolin. - Do not move! - I'll get her Ventolin! I said, 'Do not move! My brother has asthma. You must take leave the drug is the law! And shit! Well, well ... What is it? It seems that the situation is complicated. That's a big blow! I will not address that. Who is marijuana? It is a mistake, it is not our bag. Who is marijuana? To me. We must choose, wise guy. It is your or the kid? To me. Why did you not say right now? I do not know. I had completely forgotten. Give us a warning. You forgot? You, you do what you want. But when you cross the border with drugs, I have a duty to stop! Give us ... We will talk calmly. If my brother is not his Ventolin, he will suffocate. Madam, you are implying it is irresponsible? Had to think before transporting drugs. I was not clear enough? I will file a complaint against you!

Legs apart, hands up! Please calm down. You no right to do that. I want to be searched by a female. This is a misunderstanding. Open your mouth! Do not make me ... Good. Follow me!

Stay there! Stand back! You have no right to do that! Leslie! Behind the line! Okay. Come on, put your arms around the pole! See This is a hard-fanatic. What is he doing, anyway? On his knees, hurry up! Sorry, it is a misunderstanding. It is for nothing. The drug is mine. I smoke occasionally but that's it. I should have just thrown away. It will not happen again!

What assholes! There is nothing to them. No. Hello, Walter! Life is good? I can not complain. Want a coffee? Hi, Sam! Sheriff ... Your chains are ready for a while. I am not come to that. I lead an investigation. You could not see pass a 4x4 Chevrolet with five young people on board? Four of 30 years and 16. Let's see ... Not that I recall. And you, Sam? What? You should not see a 4x4 Chevrolet? No 4x4 Chevrolet. You heard him: No 4x4 Chevrolet. You have not identified the unknown in the corner? No strangers to us by but we, we know each other well. Huh, Sam? Yes, not bad. I do not even know looks like a 4x4 Chevrolet. Of course. Excuse me, Walter, If you do not know looks like a Chevrolet 4x4 ... You follow me? How can you be sure of not seeing? What Walter means, is that ... we live in a fucking bled. So, cars ... we do not see much. And a 4x4 Chevrolet even less. Fucking bled! People disappear ... The intelligence of this country are zero to shit. I can tell you. It was not always the case. Before, there were guys intelligent guys who had values ??... Guys who did a good job. I speak not of you, Sheriff. Precisely it reminds me of a story. When I was working telephone tapping. I love this story! I tell you, Sheriff? It's not always easy to hide a microphone. During a reception or a cocktail, there are a lot of noise. The background noise prevents to hear a conversation. So we decided to use the auditory system of the cat. These bugs have a hearing more developed than ours. As directional antennas which orients in the direction of what we want to hear. We opened a chat and we explored the auditory system. We removed the interference using its tail which proved an excellent the receiver. Incredible! Several months of work and loads of money! Finally, the cat was sent on a mission. He said: "You see the two guys there? "We want to listen t'ailles their conversation. "No birds, no dogs, no cats "Only two." The cat crossed the road and was run over by a taxi. We were in the van, ready to record everything. All that money and all these months of work in the trash! What a fucking mess! But what ambition! Another coffee? No, I have to go. I behind in my work. And the horseshoes? Listen, Walter, I do not want to disappoint you, and it is not yet confirmed, but they may cancel program Mounties. For irons, damn it. You will come out? Yes, it will go. With my savings and the disability pension of Sam, we cope. That's good. If you see anything, call me. Thank you for coffee. You do not know what it's like a 4x4 Chevrolet? You do not know what it's like a 4x4 Chevrolet? I'll show you, me! It looks like that! Stops, otherwise ... Stop it! It is not today you gonna break your pipe. I'm dying. Can not you see I'm dying? It will not happen to you. While I'm here, it will not happen to you. I am your guardian angel. You hear? Is there anyone? Please! Is there anyone? Help us! It has been captured by customs psychopaths! Help! What are you doing? Tom ... What do you have? You? Above, the latch! Try to shoot. Arrive you there? Go! Go on, try to shoot! Do not do anything! They will return. They will open the cages and do us harm. Do nothing, they will kill you! Much like you. Do what you got to do and scoot. He will be killed! It's our only chance. Did you saw Gab! At the slightest difference, it will be killed. It's your fault if it is there. You're really an idiot! If we do nothing, we will die. We will all die! Demeter-yourself hand and leave my brother alone! No, you hear me? Do not do anything! You stay quiet! Stop it, Michelle. Stop it! Please give it something to chew. Come on, campers, wake up! Come out, my pretty. Beware the head! It's good! Mr. Dumb! Here we go. Get out of there. Beware the head! Take care of the kid! Go! Move! Sir ... Give us a drink. Please! Shut up!

I'm sure Mr. Khalid took this route. They stopped at the gas station, just before the bifurcation. Or they took the road leads to the main customs office, or ... they took the road of Trees that goes through here. I talked to their families and friends and I concluded they probably wanted to avoid the main customs office because they had been drinking or something silly like that. In short ... You know ... You are the only inhabitants here. You are my only chance forward in this investigation. We did not see anything. Hein, Walt? As you said, it is far from the road. M. Torrent, I investigate the disappearance of a ... I know, a 4x4 Chevrolet. That is correct. So ... you see anyone. Indeed. You are parents? No. We are friends. For a long time? Walt saved my life when they fought in Iraq. On February 14, 1991. Hein, Walt? It creates links. There's a saying: "You save someone's life "And you are responsible for him until his death. " Not sure I understand. It's too twisted for me. It's like this rotten world in which we live. You live in autarky? We live not in autarky, we are self-sufficient, eh, Walt? We try to support us. We are well on their own. What people think, their contempt ... We head down to the grocery store and you pay without fuss. Everything else is bullshit. You save it? Yes. It concerns not the investigation. I can stop it. This is an RN-102? No idea. I can see? Do not leave! Analog. Can I use your bathroom? I drank too much milk. This way. Sorry! In the corridor. You must have been a hell of a soldier. These are unlawful combatants. They have no nation. They are part of the most dangerous assassins and cruel world. It's here. It must be hard for you. What?
