So lets rock with one of our golden oldies... New York Max, thats the place to make it now. Youre talking 9000 tons of steel, ...kitchen appliances, typewriters. audio gear, tons of autoparts! Works of art, hanging in the galleries Just hanging there, waiting to be plucked. Clothing, tupes, bridgework, false teeth, prostetic limbs... You name it, New York has got it all.

Maybe we should go elsewhere then Alvy? No, no, wait untill I get my glasses! Are you sure? We can go somewhere... No, no, just wait... That Alvy... He kills me every time. My back. Christ! Where is the little man? Hes indisposed... You pushing something? See what his shit is. Let me see. Where did you find it? Glass flats, Judas sea, looking all over. I give you 30. I knew youd see it my way. Merry Christmas. What the fuck was that?! A zonetripper. Ive seen his type... The whole sea is full of them. - Who was that? - Someone looking for the bathroom, come on! I put my boot in his ass and sent him on his way. Why dont he piss in the street, like everyone else? - Show me! - Where did you get this?! - Out in the zone, what do you think it is? - Probably a maintenance droid. - Stepped on a fragmine I guess. - You think so? Its not alot I can do with this. Its got good visual circuits, infrared... Unusual microgear... I give you 30 cs cash in hand. but I think I will hold on to it. This is junk, what are you gonna do with it? Its christmas eve Alvy, you should know that. You used to be an elf, didnt you? You cant expect me to go back to my girl empty handed, can you? You dont know my girl. How much for the other stuff? Yep Alvy, your as high as you ever gonna go. Cant help it if mother caught a dose in the big one. Come on. You just wait. All those years out in the zone your kids will make me look like narcissis. Hey, hey folks! Rise and shine. I got an update here on the conflict, we all know and love. The deathtoll from last nights violation of the christmas ceasefire is still rising. It currently stands at around 578, with the counterattack now well underway. I send this message of holiday cheer to all of you: Kill, kill, kill! Yo, hey Miss Wakowski. Vernon, the son of a bitch was at my door again. Who? I dont know. I didnt see him, he just keeps ringing my bell. - Then how do you know its the same guy? - Vernon, it is. - I couldnt see anybody. - Yes... thats what worries me. - Let me speak to Chief. - Hes out on his rounds. Dont worry miss Wakowski, well keep our eyes peeled. Listen Vernon I... hey! Ive got a delivery coming up this morning. - Be sure you let him up this time. - Will do. As planned, the emergency population control bill... ...will take affect at midnight, on the first of the year. Eager citizens are already lining up at sterilization centers. Wich will be opened around the clock to aid in the transition. to what the President terms: A clean break from procreation. In a related story... The two creators of the population control bill was found dead yesterday... Ready...on...boil. You took a beating on that deal man. That zonehead fell asleep and you were still jacking up the price. Well, I just want Jill to be happy. Thats what I like about you, Max. Youre a real romantic. Youre the cabby? Where you guys going? Downtown. You guys like music? Check these guys out. Used to be okay down here, you know that? Used to be, you could walk down here any time. Go out on a saturday night with just brassknuckles, nothing else.

Waiting for your first cancer cells to show or kids to be born blind and blue Because I mean, you have had one trip to many or... ...caught snake-eyes in a genetic crap game. Jesus, do you think Jill wants you to go on wading around up to your arse in... ...radioactive iodine for the rest of your life. Think she liked it better if I ended up like one of these bums? Holy shit! What the hell happened here? This was a respectable building a few months ago. Some drugged out joyrider drove a landcruiser through the security gates. You just cant keep m out. This place is going to hell. Christ! They are all over the place. Somebody ought to help these people... ...or clear them out. They just keep coming back Max. Nothings gonna keep them out except for sealing this place up like a bunker. Thats not such a bad idea. - Does she know youre back Max? - I didnt want to wake her. - Do you think she is going to let you stay? - Of course she will. She sleeps better when Im around. Makes her feel more secure. Thats a laugh man! She couldnt be more secure, then she is now. Shes sealed in tight! She doesnt need your help. She doesnt stick her little toe out if she dont need to.
