My name is Chris, and I grew up just outside of New York City. This is Zach, and he's a close friend of mine from Seattle. We've grown up with very similar lives. These are the houses we were born in... Our families... the awkward middle-school phase... The sports we played... and these are the things we did for fun... I met Zach during my first year at college, and we quickly became close friends. Our lives are fast-paced, and these are the things that we're used to seeing every day. [ Atm whirring ] [ Horns honking ] [ Atm beeping ] This is chino. He is 12 years old and lives in a rural village in Guatemala. He lives in extreme poverty, on less than one dollar a day. How can we begin to understand what his life is like, about what it means to live every day with no clean water, little food, and poor shelter? And just like chino, there are over 1.1 billion people around the world that survive on one dollar a day. Zach and I study international development in school, but there are some things that a textbook just can't answer. So we're creating a plan to spend our summer living on only one dollar a day in a rural Guatemalan village -- in chino's village. Okay. Bye, mom. I love you. Muah! I mean, I think it's just an amazing opportunity to learn for myself what it really means to live under a dollar a day... which, coming from this reality, I can't really say I have any idea. I love you. I love you, too. I'll see you. We're bringing along two filmmakers... And setting out to better understand the reality of extreme poverty firsthand. Let's do this. [ High-pitched voice ] Hello! [ Whooshing ] [ Mid-tempo music plays ] We're beginning our journey in Guatemala city with a six-hour ride on the back of a crowded chicken bus. We are headed to the village of pea blanca that's representative of rural poverty in many parts of the world. In these remote areas of Guatemala, 7 out of 10 people live under the poverty line. [ Breathing heavily ] Is that -- are you hitting stuff there? Well, I think we've got a boundary of, like, a big rock right here, so this might have to be our edge. Sweet. Maybe it can be chipped away. Yeah. It can. Okay. Why is it going out like that? You're pulling it too hard. Pulling it too hard? No. [ Chuckling ] Sadness. Right. We're getting everything... Eight weeks of this is going to be pretty intense I'm not going to lie. [ Both laugh ] Oh, God. I cannot believe it came together this is so one of those ideas that we'd talk about and never do. Well we're here... Audio recording. Filming, filming. [ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ] [ Chuckles ] Well... [ All chuckle ] We're here in the rural highlands, in the small village of pea blanca. There are about 300 people living here, most of whom are Mayan. Most of the people only spoke a Mayan dialect called Kaqchikel, and it was impossible to learn. [ Both speaking Kaqchikel ] We want to live as close as possible to the reality of poverty, so we're replicating a few key aspects of it. Our budget for the trip is one dollar a day each, for 56 days. But instead of giving ourselves one dollar every day, we're making our income unpredictable. This way, we do not know when we'll get paid. We're doing this because many of our neighbors are employed informally as day laborers or farmers, so they never know when they'll get paid or how much they'll make. We're simulating this by taking our total budget of one dollar a day each and splitting it into random numbers between zero and nine. Then, every morning, we'll pick a number out of a hat. If we pick a nine, we make nine dollars that day. Pulled a nine. No way! You got a nine? Or it's a six. That's a nine, for sure. It's great, ain't it? Well-picked. Dude. He's good. A second aspect of poverty we want to simulate is the process of starting our own business. So we're taking out a loan of $125 to pay for somewhere to live and for a plot of land to grow radishes on. Our small loan is part of a service for the poor called microfinance. Zach and I have heard both good and bad things about these banks but wanted to see firsthand if they were helping in pea blanca, both from our neighbors and by taking out a loan ourselves. This means that, every 15 days, we'll have to pay back small installments of $6.25, or else have to default on our loan. [ Camera shutter clicking ] What would you say? I mean, we've got 1,312 quetzales. That's pretty decent. That's how much we have left, yeah. So... Get a chick and sell some eggs. Yeah, I mean, out of that, we could get -- I mean, if we buy a chicken out of that, that's... Dude, we're not buying a chicken out of that. I think we should buy a chicken out of that. No, dude. Like, chickens don't, like, automatically lay eggs. [ Chuckles ] We don't have money for feed. And we can buy, like, fruit or anything else that's so much better for us. Okay, we'll research, dude. We'll research the chicken-egg complex. I will be so angry if our chicken doesn't lay eggs. [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Chuckles ] Hola. Is that really where we're gonna [Chuckling] get water from? Oh, dude, there's a bug in there. Sean, you should check this out. That's actually how much stuff is in there. Hey, we have a water source. [ Chuckles ] That was the whole point. Then we can't grow anything that's gonna finish by the time we leave. But if we can actually grow radishes, essentially, in time, does that sort of switch our idea back? Well, except for that I still don't know how to really grow radishes. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Like, anything depends on the soil content, which we have no idea about. Like, it depends on how much fertilizer we need. You just need to know how to farm, and we just don't. I mean, we could wing it and try and hope that it works. Yeah. diez? Ah. Diez. S. Ah. Es muy caro? Muy caro. Yeah. Qu mala. como as? S. Como as. [ Speaking Spanish ] Graciasdon Carlos. [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Chuckles ] S. Muchsimas gracias. Mm-hmm. [ Chuckles ] Oh, no. Oh! Oh! [ Speaks indistinctly ] Holy cow! Oh, man! Six. Hey. Gracias. De nada. [ Both chuckle ] [ Speaking indistinctly ] One of my questions was, were the people living in extreme poverty, like, really thinking about how they manage money, or was it this survival mode, and it's like just trying to scrape together anything they have just to feed their children? [ Horn honks ] [ Horn honks ] [ Both speaking Spanish ] [ Cash register dings ] [ Cash register dings ] [ Cash register dings ] [ Cash register dings ] [ Chicks chirping ] We can't buy that. Firewood is probably the most expensive thing that we were buying in our budget. But we are living on the line, on the edge, always, of being able to drop into a really bad situation. [ Cash register dings ] A little bit bumpy, too. Whoa! Ooh. [ Chuckles ] Ooh. [ Sighs ] All right. [ Blows ] [ Slurps ] Ahh! This is the best thing I've ever eaten. [ Chuckles ] [ Pencil scratching paper ] 1 pounds of black beans gives us 1,600 calories. 1 pounds of yellow rice gives us 2,000, roughly. But, still, like, 3,600 calories split amongst four people is not good enough for our daily value. [ Chuckling ] Yeah. Zach fell flat on his ass after. Every time we stand up, for some reason, like, get huge head rushes. I've almost passed out, like -- I don't know -- today probably like three times. And I don't know if that's a lack of nutrition or what the deal is, but Zach actually went for it today. We had our first full-on fall, and when he came to, he was only speaking in Spanish. [ Thunder rumbling ] I'm used to eating a lot. I'm used to being active a lot. But when you're not eating anything -- when you're eating like 500 calories, you become incredibly lethargic. You have zero energy to do anything. [ Speaking native language ] [ Girl giggling ] [ Machete chopping ] This is only my second week actually in pea blanca, and I feel like we're already showing signs of being worn down and dejected. We all have these pulgas. We all kind of got destroyed on our dirt floors. [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Camera shutter clicking ] And, you know, that was [Chuckles] that was the point where I was like, "I want to go" home. Like, I need to get out of here. "Why am I doing this?" And we were eating better than a lot of the people in the community. Jose enrico just brought us a gift. He wrote us a letter. [ Speaking Spanish ] s? Aw, gracias, Jose. S. [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Indistinct shouting ] Oh. [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Children giggling ] Oh. Yay! Okay. [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Speaking Spanish ] S. [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Chuckles ] [ Indistinct talking in Spanish ] [ School bell rings ] [ Children shouting excitedly ] That was absolutely nuts. Did you see that madness? That was 315 kids playing with like 6 different balls at the same time. And I don't know. What's up, Carlos? And I don't how many games and, like, snacks were distributed, but that was nuts. That was nuts. How fun. Yeah. How fun. [ Both speaking Spanish ] We really didn't know who he was, initially, that he was kind of just the kid that was always around. And he was just, like, so eager to learn. [ Speaking Spanish ] How... Are you? Pssh! Hi. It turns out chino's family couldn't afford the $25 cost of books and supplies for school. They had a family of eight that lived in a single room. They no longer had electricity, because they couldn't pay for it. You know, his father never knew when he was gonna work or not, 'cause he worked as a day laborer. And chino, who is 12, had to work in the fields. We'd see him coming, walking up the Mountain with this thing wrapped around his head and, like, a huge bundle of, like, logs and sticks behind him. At one point, Chris asked chino, like, you know, "if you could do anything, what would you be?" And chino's response was, you know, "I'm gonna be a farmer." And Chris was like, "no, like, what would you be if you could be anything? " And, I mean, he was like, " I'd be a pro soccer player." But at 12 years old, chino had accepted the fate that he was gonna be a farmer. [ Speaking native language ] Chino, like most of the people here, speaks Kaqchikel and only a few words of Spanish. [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Speaking indistinctly ] Aguacate. Aguacate. O? En ingls, eavocado. Avoca-- avocado. S. Avocado. Both: Avocado. [ Speaking Spanish ] Food. [ Speaking Spanish ] Ik? Ik. Both: Ik. Ik. [ Both speaking Spanish ] Both: Candle. Candle. A candl. Candl. Yeah, I mean, I think I completely saw myself in a lot of them. You know, I was, like, eager to learn, where you're, like, so excited about building little things outside of our house, and, you know, that's what I did for my childhood, and realizing that it is the situation that they're in that's holding them back, not who they are. Hey. cmo ests? How... How are you? How are you? How are you? "How... are... you?" [ Rooster crows ] The rbanare growing. I know. I'm gonna pay off on my finance loan. [ Sniffs ] I'm gonna eat more. [ Chuckles ] It's gonna happen, man. I can sense it already. [ Chuckles ] Very clumpy, though. They are really clumpy. That's bad, right? Everything about a banana just brings me joy here. You peel it back. It's naked. It's a naked fruit. [ Speaks indistinctly ] I just take a bite and savor it each time like it's the best bite of banana I will ever take, every single time. I just make sure, like, the top of the banana is always even after. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like, your teeth marks kind of indent it like this. Yeah. So then you got to play the game and, like, reverse the bite. Oh, nice. Yeah. Move it up. So that it's even, you know? And it slows down your eating, too. As economics majors, Chris and I were really interested in, how did a person living under a dollar a day manage their money? So we were asking people questions like, "how much money do you make? What are your expenses?" Where do you save money? Do you have any outstanding loans?" You know, these are really personal questions for anyone. Hola. Buenas tardes. Hola. Buenas. [ Speaking Spanish ] Anthony, in, I think, the first week we were there, he was, like, the first grown-up from the community to come to our house, introduce himself. You know, he was so excited to meet us. [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Chuckles ] [ Grunts ] [ Chuckles ] Ah. See? Just 24 and 20 years old, Anthony and rosa already manage a household of eight people. Mm. [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Baby coos ] [ Chuckles ] Oh. No? [ Baby crying ] [ Chuckles ] As a family, they survive on $1.25 each per day to pay for not only food, but larger costs of a new baby, their kids' education, and repairs to their house. Like, his wife is 20. I'm 20. And she has three children. His wife's younger than me, dude. He's 24. I look up to her so much. [ Both speaking Spanish ] They're teaching us how to more efficiently make fires... cook more substantive food... And better bargain in town. Living so close to the edge, these small changes are having huge impacts on our lives. Probably the most important one is lard. We bought some straight lard today in town to try to add to our fat content. If you could feel this texture right now, it is one of the foulest things ever. [ Sizzling ] This lard right here has -- what was it -- 208 grams of fat and 1,080 calories, which is the equivalent of more than the rice or beans that we were eating. And we started mashing our beans and refrying our beans in lard. It's so good in the stomach. [ Speaking Spanish ] In our third week, they invited us over to their home for a small snack. But when we arrived, they were preparing the traditional meal of pulick, served only twice a year for special occasions. [ Both chuckle ] Oh! Oh! s? S. Claro. Claro. Mmm. Sean, you can sit down. Yeah. He wants to say a few things to the camera. Oh. S. [ Speaking Spanish ] Muchsimas gracias a mi hermano. Yes. [ Chuckles ] Our desire to repay Anthony and rosa, not only for the expense of the incredible food but also their generosity, is overwhelming. They have so little, yet they're willing to give so much. We all agreed that, somehow, we will save the money to cook them a pulick dinner before we go. We have like 60. It's only three days. We can just decrease our amount. We can get like, you know, a pound and a half. I mean, I don't think we even really need to dip into our savings that much... Yeah. ...At all. That would be awesome. If we just want to, like, not eat very much. [ Shivers, sniffles ] [ Rooster crows ] I drew a low number today, so we're having some... Struggles with how we need to pay Anthony's family back and also pay off our loan, which is due in three days. So... We drew really low numbers for four days. I pulled four numbers in a row, and two of them were zeros, and two of them were ones. So amongst the four of us, we had 12 cents a person to live on, per day. And, you know, we woke up, and it was market day, and we literally have no money for food. Open the other one now. [ Hinges squeak ] So this is a big pull we need a minimum a two or higher if we get a one no bananas if we get a zero we have to go talk to Anthony and take out a loan from him. Let's see it. It's a nine. No way! No! [ Chuckles ] Yeah! Seany boy! Dude, you're the clutchest puller in the world! [ Giggles ] It's a mosh pit! Whoo! Yes! Oh, my God! Dude, so huge. Bananas for everyone! [ Chuckles ] We got lucky and pulled a nine. But what if you're out of food and you don't know the next time money will be coming in? How do you choose between feeding your child or keeping them in school? [ Water splashing ] [ Speaking Spanish ] Both: S. Both: S. It's... Day 28. Right? Day 28? Day 28. Yeah. We had started to do these really amazing interviews around the fourth week. And Chris and I spoke Spanish, so we were understanding everything that was going on, and, you know, we had started to be affected by these stories, but Ryan and Sean didn't speak Spanish. And they were talking, and they were like, "when you finally" deal with learning how to survive, it's not so bad." No problem -- it's not that hard, you know? We're halfway through. I could do this for another, you know, two years. I just got really angry and upset because, clearly, the people we're around, you know, they had learned to survive. But it wasn't okay. And it wasn't easy for them, and they had to, like, work so hard every single day, and they couldn't follow their dreams, because they couldn't go to school, and 'cause they had to provide for their family. And Chris and I were so involved with this research that we weren't sharing what was going on. What were some of the questions in general? I mean, I guess I don't really even know what you guys were asking. We started getting into where all their income was coming from and, you know, like, what skills they use to work and what they really deal with to find money in emergencies, and, you know [Chuckles] their lives are so much more complicated than our initial interviews showed. Even something as simple as what you cook with is important. A broken stove or cooking over an open fire can have dramatic effects on the health of a family, especially on the kids. [ Baby crying ] [ Speaking Spanish ] Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It's incredibly hard to save up a large amount of money for a cooking stove, but Anthony did it with 12 of his friends by using an innovative idea called a savings club. Together, they each decided to save $12 every month. And at the end of each month, the total sum of $144 would be randomly distributed to one of the members. This process then repeats itself until each person has benefited from a large sum of money at a single time. And that large sum of money was much more useful to them because they could take that money and spend it on a big-ticket item like a stove or maybe pay for a wedding. And, you know, that's really innovative. [ Camera shutter clicks ] And we started talking about how close this community was, and we hang out with chino every day. And his mom, this past year, got really sick, and they don't even have enough money to, you know, get a car to go to the hospital in town, and Anthony covered the entire thing. [ Speaking Spanish ] And Anthony actually paid for them to go to the hospital. He paid for the doctor's visits. And the medicine. And the medicine. Anthony can afford the loan because he's the only one in the village who has a formal job. Unlike everyone else, he can count on getting a regular paycheck. [ Speaking Spanish ] And while Anthony did help these other people, like, that's still a huge strain on their own finances. Yeah, that's where, like, if there was an institution willing to take on that risk and lend to someone like chino's parents, you know, then they don't have to put a strain on Antonio. And, you know, not everyone has that community around them or the people they can go to in times of need. Hola. And, you know, and that was something that -- hola. Hola. Holachino. Chris. [ Chuckles ] What's up, chino? Zach, hola. cmo ests? Bien. Bien. How are you? [ Chuckles ] Qu bueno. Good. I am good. You look nice. How are you? How are you? Good. S. Bueno. So, yeah, not everyone has, you know, such a tight-knit community around them. So, if you have an emergency like chino's parents here, like, what are you gonna do if you don't have that person right next to you or you don't have the emergency funds or that community to rely on? That's true. Actually, temple is pretty sick at the moment. He's got a little bit of an upset tummy. This is just going to make me vomit. [ Chuckles ] At one point, I had both giardia and E. Coli at the same time, and, you know, that's no good, especially when you only have two pairs of boxers and you're sleeping, you know, on the same mat, sharing a blanket with someone next to you. I think Chris is really sick. I just heard him get up. It just doesn't sound like he's doing very well. Dude, I think I have that like sulfuric burp thing happening again. [ Burps loudly ] [ Breathes deeply ] Like, I can't even push on my stomach. [ Breathes deeply ] I can't sleep another night like this. We're gonna go get Chris tested for some bacterial infections and see if he has a parasite, or, hopefully, it's just a stomach thing. Today, in town, we found out that Chris has some parasites in his stomach. It's called giardia -- giardia, I believe. And it's, like, lmng in my small intestine in here. And it causes, like, excessive bloating and stomach pressure. [ Speaking Spanish ] Doscientos quetzales. The medicine is 200 quetzales. So even if people could afford to get tested, it's incredibly expensive to actually get the medicine. There's no way we could pay that cost. I have to use medicine that we brought in case of emergency. [ Siren wailing ] If we can't budget for a simple sickness, what will we do in the case of a more serious problem? Just two months before we arrived, hurricane Agatha smashed through Guatemala. Disaster workers in Guatemala say at least a dozen people are dead. [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Speaking Spanish ] The tropical storm Agatha slammed into its pacific coast Saturday. [ Speaking Spanish ] If you've lost everything, how do you get the money to get back on your feet? How do you begin building a lump sum to start a business? We wanted to see if getting a loan from a traditional bank was even an option for our neighbors. Okay, so, you're gonna have to put the camera down initially, I think, unless you want me just, like, through the door and then put it down. Yeah. Buena, Buenas. We can't take photos inside. So, um... Are you, uh, going for the, uh, discreet film? Yeah. Yeah, sweet. [ Speaking Spanish ] Let's get out. Let's get out. Let's get out. Let's get out. That was highly illegal to be doing. So, I tried to see if we could get a 3,000-quetzale loan. And the problem is we need all of these other items. We need a receipt of our electricity bills. We need an N.I.T. Number, which she said costs a bunch of money to get. We need a copy of the amount of money we're making, which I don't think we can get if we have an informal job. Bills from the last three months, two people who will sign for us, and then we need to be able to sign our name, too. There's no chance we could get a loan from that bank. There's just no way. We visited rosa again to see if there were any other options. Grameen provides reliable savings accounts and loans designed to empower the poorest of the poor to improve their lives. [ Speaking Spanish ] With a loan of just $200, rosa was able to start her own weaving business. It was so huge to see the potential for what even the simple access to credit can do in the lives of our neighbors, of our close friends. Ah, s. Oh. [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Light laughter ] When a grameen borrower receives a loan, they also commit to opening a long-term savings account, a safe and a convenient way to build up a large sum of money. We found that beyond using a loan or savings account to start a business, our neighbors were using them to absorb shocks and make investments around the house. [ Speaking Spanish ] These financial services, such as microfinance, they go far beyond just providing extra capital. They really shape the family. And they have these side effects of empowering women. Finally, we have rbanos. We have grown our rbanos. And now we have tons and tons of rbanos. What happened is there's an explosion of rbanos. Instead of selling our radishes, we're giving them out as gifts to thank the people we've interviewed. These radishes represent a new source of income for us, one that could move us closer to $2 a day. While that still doesn't seem like much, it would double our livelihood. And it's kind of those small, incremental changes that actually have such a profound effect on people that are lmng at that level. And, you know, I feel like that will have such an impact on the next generation of that family, that it's really there that we'll see progress out of poverty. [ Up-tempo music plays ] [ Speaking Spanish ] So, after all of this research, we had saved up the whole time for this pulick dinner. It was just this amazing moment, and that was the last day that we were there. A little bit of Monica in my life a little bit of Erica by my side a little bit of Rita's all I need a little bit of Tina's what I see a little bit of Sandra in the sun we wanted to convey just, like, how appreciative we were of what they had done for us. Not only from, you know, what they had shared with us, but being our friends and, you know, building a relationship with us, and in many ways teaching us and accepting us as a friend instead of just, you know, a foreigner. mambo number five! Aah! What can I do as an indmdual? That's the hardest part about it, and what we were talking about last night, is... That there is no one answer, you know? That we've poured, you know, $2.5 trillion into international development trying to end poverty, and a lot of times it's just made things worse. But, like, that's what we're trying to prove so much right here is the power of partial solutions that, like, you know, there's more people who are not lmng in poverty than there are who are lmng in poverty. Like, each indmdual can affect and help a single other indmdual. We can change the world. Hello. Hello. How are you? Good. Thank you. How are you? I'm good. Thank you. What is your name? My name is Carlos. What is your name? My name is Chris. It's nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you. [ Both laugh ] [ Speaking Spanish ] Good morning. All: Good morning. How are you? All: How are you? [ Speaking Spanish ] How are you? All: Good. Good. S. What... ...ls... ...ls... ...your... ...Your... ...Name? ...name? [ Speaking Spanish ] What is your name? I now have a much deeper respect for someone lmng at that level. I personally -- I lost 20 pounds in just two months. And I got to go home and rehabilitate, but what if that's someone's life where they live like that day in and day out, with no nutrition and not an adequate amount of food? It was something that we could never have, you know, imagined. It was something we had to live. [ Camera shutter clicks ] [ Speaking Spanish ] Graciastone. Ohh, s. Muchas gracias. Oh, Zach! Can we have it? Can we have it? Look, it's a chicken! Can we have it, Zach? I really -- [ Dog barking ] [ Laughs ]
