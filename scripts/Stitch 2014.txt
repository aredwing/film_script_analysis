Sorry, we, uh, we made a wrong turn about 100 miles back. Tried to call you. There's no reception out here. That explains it then. No, it doesn't. Look... I don't know what to tell you. I have been standing in the blazing heat for more than an hour, a minor pain in the grand scheme of things. The pain of your birth hunts you down in the end. Okay, maybe it's time to unpack now. Yeah. Okay. The rules are simple. No smoking on the premises, no pets, and no moving of any furniture. See you later. Oh, no, baby, I got it. It's good. Are you sure? Yeah. I'll be in there. Excuse me, excuse me. You know how you said you were waiting out in the hot sun all day? Yes. Why didn't you go inside the house? I don't go in there. Crazy, crazy bitch. Oh, man. Pirino, seriously? I warned you. You know this place is a disaster. Look, me and Colline, we're gonna take the master bedroom, all right? And why is that? Because I'm me. Dick. How? How did we let Pirino get us into this mess? He means well. I guess. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. You got this on your own? Yeah. Okay. I'll see you out there, okay? Okay. When Pirino said we were roughing it, he was not joking, was he? Yeah. It's okay though, maybe it'll help with the ritual. Listen to you, man. I made some changes, you know. Besides, we're camping, right? This is like the Taj Mahal of camping tents. Yeah, right. This old lady's got some strange taste. Yeah, seriously. It's kind of weird though, I feel like, I don't know, like I've seen this shit somewhere before. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, remember when we first came to L.A., we stopped at that bed and breakfast? Yeah, Joshua Tree. Remember? Oh, yeah. Hey, look, it's an antique. Oh, God. Oh, do you remember when your dad taught us the waltz? There you go. Why do you want to waltz? You know. I know, we hated it, huh? One, two, three. One, two... You still suck. I'm a better waltzer than you. Yeah, well... I make up for it in style. You're not gonna leave me? I'm not making that mistake again. I promise. I'm here for you. For me? You know, Lilly was a part of both of us. You really got to be there for her, too. Of course. Of course. And your son. Maybe this isn't just my deal. We have to do this together. 100%, I promise. 100%. Hey, I'm putting my faith in Pirino. Pirino of all people, come on. I trust Pirino. Well, you're crazy. Shut up. I trust you too. You do? Yeah. I'm gonna go unpack. Okay. Don't lose yourself in here and keep me lonely. Fuck. Someone down there? Okay. Oh, shit. Is anyone in there? Hey, thinking about her, huh? Yeah. Come on. It's time for a huggy-hug. Huggy-hug. Jesus. I was a good mom, you know? Yeah. You are. Hey, forget about that. Come help me with this stuff, I can't do this in my condition. Your condition? Jesus. It's not even pea-sized yet. Yeah. Best to be cautious. Remember when we were younger, we talked about having our kids and watching them grow up together? Yeah. We can still do it. Yeah. Hey, Colline. Yeah. When Marsden stayed with you guys... did he ever talk about me or Lilly? I'm sure he was thinking about you, Sera. Wow. Mars, you did good, man. This is perfect. You said you wanted death effigy, right? It's beautiful. Hey, you know, I've been meaning to give this to you. What's this? Remember that week you and Serafina went to Paris, Lilly stayed with us? Yeah. Why didn't you tell me about this? I just found it recently, it was under the rug in the guest room. I miss her, man. You know, when she passed, it broke us all up. You know that, right? Yeah. She's gonna take time, right? Time is now, man. It's tonight. Huh? Throw that energy around. You wanna put this up? Let's raise it. Yeah, let's see what happens to it. Yeah, I got it. One, two, three. Breathe in and out, deeply from the abdomen. You can do this, you can do this. We each brought an object that holds Lilly's energy. These are attachments to a life that is no more. We have to die to these attachments in order to set ourselves free. I can't do this. You can do it. You have more toys at home, you have more pictures at home, you can do this. That's good. That's good. I want you guys to start breathing. Rapidly. Fast, tight breathing. Equal amounts of air in and out through your nostrils. Elevating your consciousness out of your bodies. I want you to face death, enter death, don't be afraid of death. Without the awareness of death, life is ordinary and trivial. It's only because death stalks us that life comes alive. I want you to face the mysteries of death, face it in a way others dare not tread. I want you to forget your religion. I want you to leave behind your spiritual beliefs. Any preconception you have of what death is. There is no heaven, there is no hell, there is no afterlife, there is no reincarnation! Death is the infinite abyss of pure nonexistence. Enter it and be done. I want you to call death with me, call death. I call death. I call death. I call death. I call death. I can't say that. You can say it, "I call death". I call death. Say it! Say it. I call death. I call death! I call death! I call death! I call death. I call death! I call death. I call death! I call death! I call death! I call death! I call death! I call death! I call death! I call death! I call death! I call death! I call death! I call death! I call death! I call death! You call death! Okay, guys, let's just breathe. Deep breaths from the abdomen. Wait a minute. What's wrong? Are you okay? I can't remember anything. Does anybody remember planning this trip? Sure. We, uh... Honey. I don't remember either. Huh. I can't remember a thing. What? What? Oh, my God. What? I just saw something in the house. I just saw something in the house. Something in the house, we're all outside. Mars, babe. You really scared the crap out of me. Yeah, that was spiritual, heavy breathing nonsense. It's pointless. Have you ever hallucinated like that before? No. You okay, sweetheart? It's not just your memory. I can't remember how and why we came out here. How did our life get to be such a nightmare? Baby, is everything okay in there? Yeah. Come back to bed. Yeah, in a minute. Wake up. Mars. Marsden. Mars. Mars. I want to know who did this. Somebody speak! I saw that burn in the fire. Yeah. Do you think this is funny? No, not at all. If this is your idea of helping people, it's sick, it's fucking stupid. Look, Sera, I don't know what's going on but there's no one here who'd do this. Okay? This is my daughter's doll. I can still smell her scent in it, I can smell her, I can feel her. How dare you! No, why don't you stand up for her? Look, guys, there's got to be a rational explanation, okay? Did you do this, man? Where's the needle and the thread? Maybe you did it. I'll find out. Show you who your friends really are. Sera. Oh, my God. That trick was revolting. I get it, shock therapy. Why didn't you just tell me? Did you think I was gonna stop you? I probably would have. Look, if you want me to be part of this whole spiritual guru thing, we got to start trusting each other. Why do you think I would do that? I didn't do that. The whole point was to release the inner demons, so why would I recycle them? It doesn't make any sense. Look, if this is gonna work, we have to be a unified front. Great. She's tearing our room apart. Damn it. Fuck. Colline? Colline! She okay? Oh, my God. What? Who cut you? No, no, no, no, it's just stitched up. What happened to you? Listen, you guys stay right here, I'll be right back. Something hit me. It burns! Baby, it hurts. Here, all together. It's okay, just relax. All right. Guys, get upstairs. Get in a room, lock the door and call the police, okay? Let's take her outside. Fuck it. Just go upstairs. Hurry up. Go with her, go with her. I'm right behind you. I'm right behind you. We got to find him! Just go upstairs! Get him! Get him! Go upstairs! Lock the door! We're gonna get him, all right? We're gonna get him. Lock the door! Hey, come on! Snap out of it, man. Go check the front of the house, I'll check the back of the house. Okay. All right? Okay. Hurry up, come on. Let's go. Marsden, get down here! Shit. Marsden, get out here! Pirino! Pirino? Pirino? Jeez. Oh, my God. There's nobody out there. What do you mean? He's gone. He's completely gone. How can that be? He took the car. Come on. What? Why? I just don't get it. I mean, how the hell can someone stitch you up that quickly? I just don't get it. Doesn't make any sense. You were only alone for a couple of minutes. At least we know you weren't hallucinating earlier on. Yeah. I still can't remember anything. Look, let's just get out of here. He took the car. Well, this is just fucking great. We have no car... no food. And somehow we got to get to a hospital. And how do you propose we do that? Fuck. We're gonna have to walk. He's right. There's no other way. That's 50 miles. 50 miles to the nearest town. Look, we're gonna have to figure out some protection. You don't plan this right, we could die out there. What if he comes back? Fuck him, I hope he comes back. Oh, screw it, screw it. I'm taking a break. Oh, God. If we can't walk a quarter of a mile I don't think we can make 50. I mean, there's bound to be some cars once we hit the highway. We didn't see any driving up past Barstow. Guys, we got to stay positive, all right? I don't know. Maybe if we get into that valley, we might be able to pick up a signal. What do you think? Looks like about 20 miles. That's less than 50. Oh, God. We're gonna die. Yeah. This ain't right. How can this be possible? I don't know. There's not supposed to be an eclipse right now, is there? The moon is working on its own almanac. What does this mean? Guys, we should go back. No, dude, we should just keep going. I don't want to go back to that house. What do you think now? Maybe we should go? Oh, shit! Go, go! Oh, my God. Yeah. It's the end of the world. Hey! Maybe it was just the wind. Maybe there's a window open on the other side. No, no. Pirino, it's just a wall on that side, man. Go and check it out. Are you fucking kidding me? Oh, God. Get out of there! Shit. Look, man, you come out or we're coming in! Marsden. Dude you just signed your own fucking death warrant! Go! Remember, there's, like, an axe or a crowbar. Yeah, I saw that. Go get it, Pirino, go! Okay, listen, take care. Hey, take this, okay? Come on, man! Come on! I'll try. God. That armor's thick. So's the wall, man. What the hell is this thing doing down here? Don't let it psych you out. Any two-bit magician can do that! Look, motherfucker, I ain't scared, man! You ain't scaring nobody! I got a big axe out here! It's going to up your ass, through your mouth, smashing your teeth out, you motherfucker! You dirty motherfucker! You dirty motherfucker! Hey, Mr. Spiritual Leader. Come on, calm down. Look, I got an idea. Got it? Yeah. Definitely don't think he's gonna get out of there, man. Are we? I was thinking of us last night. Yeah. Me and you. I got something. People are being warned to stay indoors. The electrical storm has already claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Reports are still coming in from every corner of the globe. Scientists remain perplexed as to the cause of the eclipse and how it could be visible on every continent. Religious leaders in Europe, India, the Middle East and America have called all peoples of all faiths to pray. How can this be possible? I mean, how can the eclipse be seen all over the world or even, like... It's the wrath of God. Look, I wasn't religious before but I guess it took the end of the world. Seriously, am I the only one that's gonna keep their fucking head on? No. Maybe Colline's right. Great. We have to save our baby. Are you serious? What? How could you do this to me? Did you think that I would never find out? I'm not stupid. Did you think that I'm stupid? I'm sorry! God, I'm sorry! It was like the worst year of my life. Yeah, it was the worst year of my life too, and I didn't go running into the arms of somebody else. I'm so sorry, just forgive me. Ten years, man. Ten years of spiritual work. I still want to kick your ass. Fuck. Fuck. Spiritual work, my ass. You're a fraud, our whole relationship's a joke. We came here because we trusted you. Now we're all gonna die. You trusted me? None of you trusted me! None of you believed in me! Especially you. You know what a joke is? You know what the fraud is? Right there. Fuck you. Sera, I'm sorry, but Marsden and I go way back. No. No, we don't. I was always meant to have his baby. No. I'm not going to hear any of that high school abortion shit. We put that in the past. This is destiny. Sweetheart. Give it back! Get the fuck away from me! Is this a high school promise ring? Have you lost your mind? Come on, the end of the world is happening and what the fuck are we doing? Talking about this! Sera. No, you get away from me. I don't know you people. Sera. I don't know you. I love you, Sera, I'm sorry. Fuck! Why? Our baby. Sera! God, shit. Come on. Please, please, open the door. Come on. Just leave me alone! I do not want you coming in this bedroom. Why don't you go sleep with Colline or Pirino for all I care. The three of you can go doing this, whatever you do. Sera, I'm sorry, okay. Look, when Lilly died... I know I left. That was a weak move, but I was scared, okay. I've been an arrogant prick our whole relationship, and it took electrical hellfire for me to see that. I don't know how you can forgive me, but I'm begging you, please. I miss you, sweetheart. I'm sorry, Sera. I am so mad at you right now. I mean, if this is the end... you know, like, if this is really the end of it all, I want you to know something. I'm nothing without you. I mean, whether we get out of here or not, whether we stay together or not, I'm always gonna love you. Nothing's ever gonna change that. Not even you. You shouldn't have done that. Look who's talking. It's bad timing. We're out of time. You know what? When we get out of here, if we get out of here, me and you are gonna settle up. I'm so sorry, man. Right now we got bigger problems. Come on. This is it. I found some kerosene, candles and a couple of lanterns. It's not much. All our food's out there. Oh, great. We still got water. I'm assuming cannibalism isn't an option. I really screwed up, man. I'm sorry. Save it. It's just the two of us. We'll keep each other safe. What do you make of this shit, man? I've been studying Tarot cards and symbols for years and this, this right here, this freaks me out. How would she know about this months in advance? Clear premonition. Oh, come on, man. I don't believe in that shit. Well, you know what? Your belief system needs to get a little more flexible. It's that landlady. She owns this place. We figure her out, we figure everything out. So now she is in charge of the weather, huh? Hey, she knew about the guy in the basement. What? What did she say when we first pulled up? What did she say to you? I don't know, she spoke in riddles. You know what she said? She threatened me for causing her pain. I'm gonna go to bed. Well, you know what? It's been 36 hours, I'm gonna get some rest. Maybe things will be better in the morning. Sweet dreams. Oh. Oh, where's your heart? Where is your heart? I'm scared. Lilly? Lilly? Lilly? Lilly? Wake the fuck up! Sera? Sera. Sera. Sera. Oh, my God. You're okay. Oh, my God. Yeah. Yeah. Hurry up. Sit up, come on. Get your back up. Okay. What the fuck was that? Oh, my God. How is he doing this? My baby. Oh, my God. My baby's gone. Why is he doing this? My baby is gone! Fuck this, man! Fuck death! Why did you cut the rope? You, it sees through you, it will shut you up. Oh, you know all this bullshit? Yeah. You're a liar! Why did you cut the rope? Just answer that. He can see into your soul! Why did you cut the rope? Stop! I'm leaving. I'm out of here! Colline! Colline! No, baby, no! I'm glad Lilly died. She was a mistake. Fuck her! No! No, hey! Baby, no! No! Colline, no! No! No! I know. I'm sorry. Marsden! Whoa, man. Are you out of your fucking mind? Colline was right. Why did she cut the rope? Why did you cut the rope? Don't you take another step, Mars, don't make me do it. Look, she's innocent. There's something else down here, man. You know that. Pi. Please, this won't bring her back. Please. Baby. I'm sorry. You know what? I think we can cut these. You know, I really think they're made out of our own nerve endings or something. How is that possible? How can any of this be? Shit. We have unfinished business. Colline? Shut up. Mars. What did you just do? I put them into time out, just the way you like it, right? No more distractions from your work, right, daddy? You thought you could get away with dismissing me the way you dismissed Lilly? Trying to ignore me? Really? You have a stitch on the back of your neck that leads into your brain. You like it, huh? You like it. You like it. I'm sorry. Damn it. All men are puppets! That is the infinite abyss of pure nonexistence! How does it feel to be fucked and thrown aside like a piece of shit, huh? How does it feel to be fucked and thrown aside like a piece of shit? Look, Colline, I'm so sorry. Death is... No heaven, no hell. No afterlife, no reincarnation. No other side. Say it! Drop your spiritual beliefs. Our hearts have descended together to dance in the fires of hell for all eternity. I'm sorry. You took a piece of me. Now it's time to return the favor. You like that. God, please, just tell me how the fuck to get out of this! Please! Fuck! This is your fault. My fault? You're the one that wanted us to come on death trip, bring us all the way out here, meditate on death. This is your fault, man. It's not my fault. Death found us. Death found us. Shit! Lilly... Baby, if you can hear me right now... You have to cross over, baby. I love you so much. You have to let go of us. I saw something out there. There's just no one out there. No. There's something out there. We have to help her cross over. Okay. I don't want to die here. We'll make it out of here, I promise. It's good to see you two together again. Maybe you're right. Maybe I started all this. I'm gonna end it. Where are you going, man? To hell. What is it? It's ball lightning. It's beautiful. Not as beautiful as you. Ah! No! I'm gonna fucking kill you! Aah! Oh, no. No, no, no, no, P. You okay? Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. It's okay. It's okay. Fuck. Oh, my God. No! Don't! Wait! Shit! Wait, wait. Please. What have we done? Fuck. Row, row, row your boat Gently down the stream Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream Row, row, row your boat Gently down the stream Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream Oh, fuck you. Fuck you. Whoever is doing this, fuck you! But remember... ...the pain you birth hunts you down in the end. The pain you birth is the pain that hunts us down in the end. What? It's not Lilly who needs to be saved. Baby, it's us. What did we do? Let me go, I'm scared. Mommy. Lilly? My God, Sera. Sera. Quantum physics. That's what it's got to be. We've been, like, sucked into a parallel universe or something. No, no. I won't let you. No, come on, I can hear, please. No, the thing up there is not her. No, it's not Lilly. It's not. Sera, listen, I know what this is. What? We have to ask for Lilly's forgiveness. Why? We were terrible parents. Oh, no. Yes, we were. We always put ourselves first. No, we gave her everything. No, no! We treated her like a doll, a disposable doll, Sera. No. Pirino, he drugged us. He drugged us. What? Yeah. Yeah, can't you get it? We're walking around our own house and we can't even recognize it. Lilly's still alive. She's still alive. What's wrong? Can't you feel it? Come on. Baby. It's okay. Me and Daddy are here. You're safe now. Sera! Sera! Sera! Let her out! Let her out of there! Lilly... Is that you? My poor baby. It's my fault. It's your daddy's fault. How can you forgive me? Just take me. We have missed you. You missed me? You must all return, no matter what. Return where? You know where. No, I don't. This is real. How would it be? I'm a human. Are you? Of course I am. What the fuck are you talking about? Self deception is a cruel mess. Tell me what the fuck is going on! You know what's there. You're back. This is today. Am I dead? No. Then where am I? Hell. You don't have to die to get there. How the fuck can I be there and here at the same time? How can anyone be anywhere at any time? This is the mystery of consciousness. You can occupy many bodies at once. Some physical, some ethereal... but ultimately an illusion. A part of you is in Lilly's subconscious now in her dying mental images. Your lives that feel so real are merely dreams within dreams, rising and collapsing like waves in the ocean of consciousness. You and Lilly are right here... right now. Crystallized into form by the power of your mutual pain. Tell me... What kind of god would make a fucking place like this? You tell me that. Tell me! The god you dreamed up! Suffer or surrender. It is always your choice. It was never locked. Why don't you turn the light of your attention back onto your own shadow? What happened? Oh, man. What? What? Put a little less pedal on that metal. You guys were the ones that wanted to leave Vegas. I wanted to stay. Yeah, well, we just want to get home in one piece. Oh, my God. Get off his back, he's fine. Hey, Lilly Willy, you want to drive? Hey, no, no, no, put your seat... She's awake. Oh, my God. Look, we're doing everything that we can. And we're gonna keep trying. There was, um... There was another car, and, um... There was no other driver. It was me. Yes, there was. It jumped the median and it wasn't our fault. It wasn't our fault. I can't lose you right now, please, I can't lose you right now. I'm sorry. I don't know how I got to this realization. This. This, we can't do this anymore. God, no, listen. We did it. What? There was no other car. You know there wasn't. No. Yes. Yes. Come on. No, no. Yes, there was and I do not want to talk about this. You wanted me to lie. There's no way to know it. Listen. We're just killing ourselves. Look at this shit. Look at it. There was no other car. Sera, listen to me. I'm so sick and tired of killing ourselves... with guilt. I can't do it anymore. I can't watch this happen to you. Or to me. It's gonna get better. It's gonna get better. I miss Lilly too. I miss her so much, baby. I miss her so much.
