Trust me. Yes you bought this all. And now you're rollin' in this heap. But you paid you paid. You paid for this dirty Berber rug. Which isn't actually so bad... because I think you can get these stains out with a little club soda. This is all worthless. Keep looking. We'll find something. Bingo. Shh. This is ridiculous, Michelle, it's such a waste of time. What's that? "Found footage" that we found. Wouldn't it be amazing if it was one of those celebrity sex tapes and we could sell. My God, my God. Put it in. All right. Carlsbad Police, what's your emergency? Excuse me? - Ma'am, what's your emergency? - I'm a man, douche bag. My voice is altered because I've got 8 demons in me... all taking turns to speak. - Anyway, I killed 5 people. - I'm sorry? I served them 6-inch tuna subs that I wiped my ass with. - They all died from toxoplasmosis. - Who? The entire cast of The Artist including that dog Uggie. What? Send the police, jerk-off. And if you're hungry, I still have half a sandwich left. The Carlsbad community was leveled by tragedy today... as 3 clergy members were found dead. there was a call into our office in a facsimile... saying that there may have been or might be a murder situation. But we cannot confirm or deny that the cast of the film The Artist... has been murdered in the basement of this house. I, myself, am not a fan of the film. Didn't really get it. Hi, my name is Dana Rosti and we're shooting a documentary. Why are you shooting a documentary? Well, when I was 10 years old... my father murdered some people in our basement. And I just found out that he murdered them while an exorcism was being performed. On him. By clowns. Without his pants. I'm sorry, can we stop for a second? After 6 months of going to trial, my dad was proven not guilty... based on insanity, but I didn't believe that. Wait a minute. Yeah! Aah! Aah! It's the Olympics. Whoo! Ooh! Hello. How about a 5-way? A year later, he was transferred to one of the top psychiatric facilities in the world... which happens to be in Italy, which is, like, in a whole other country. - Are we recording? - We're on. - And this is camera 1? - Yeah. And this is camera 2? And this is the Steadicam. And this is my 3D camera? And this is my motion-capture camera? Okay. Let's do this. You came on a very good day today, Miss Rosti. Your father is in very high spirits. Italy had cutting-edge equipment, brilliant doctors. I need 3 CCs of marinara, stat. So listen, there's a good chance he might not even remember you. Okay. Don't take offense to that. It's just part of the disease. Right. Okay. Let's just go with one camera, okay? Great. Dad? Do you remember me? Connect the dots. Connect the dots. Connect the dots. Connect the dots. Connecticut. No, dumb-ass. Connect the dots. I'd rather play Candy Land or Jenga or something... I'd rather play Connect the Dots and Dana Shut Up. Okay. Great. Now, give me your phone. What? Give me your phone. Give me your phone. Give me your phone. I'm getting it out of my purse. Give me your phone. And, bam! You just bought me 2 Taiwanese hookers for the price of one on Croupon. Listen, I came here because I have to tell you something really important. Shh. Dad. Now, get out of here! I ain't got time for you no more. "Out," he said. Away with you. Out. I'm a pretty princess. - Say it! - You're a pretty princess. - Louder! - You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Finally. Ling Mi One and Ling Mi Two. Who's sitting on my face first? Since that day, I never went back to see my old man. While I was building a career, I was looking for the man of my dreams. And I found him... the way all attention-seeking, narcissist slut-bags do. Dana. Ha, ha. That's me. That's not you guys. Okay, here. Just hold that. That's for you . Okay. Will you accept this rose? I would love to. Okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. Want this? Yeah, ride that donkey. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Join in, dude. Join in. Come on. Aaron and I fell in love and got married He had a beautiful 2-year-old daughter named Liz. And a New York strip for you, young lady. I forgot. It was just a matter of time before I picked up the whole mothering thing. It's good. All right. Can't have a steak without your steak knife. Good girl. Good girl. Yummy. Okay, eat up, ducky, they're starving in Africa. Liz grew up so fast. She was your typical teenage daughter with a few issues to work out. No, honey, now, don't. Don't... We had Jonah about a year ago. People say we're overprotective, but I don't really see it. Our family was growing... so it was time to move out of our cramped one-bedroom rental... that we shared with the 12-member Rodriguez family. After an exhaustive search... I found that the house I grew up in was available. This is amazing. It's so peaceful here, honey. I know, sweetheart. Another big milestone for the Galen family. Okay. Let's do this. Okay. Welcome to the new house, everyone. Well, this is my beautiful daughter coming down our new stairs. There is my little man with my favorite gal. Hello, sweetie. Okay. This house will work. I just took the biggest dump upstairs. Felipe. Yes, missus? It's time for Jonah's bath. No, no, no. Sorry, not tonight, missus. Just kidding. Ha, ha, ha. Baby, come over here. If I may propose a little toast? Very romantic. Well, thank you. To nothing but beautiful memories in our new home. Babe. I love you. I love you. Cheers. Cheers. Make sure you record every moment. This is gonna be riveting to watch. I just wanna document our first full week in this house. I'll edit it later. It's all part of the master plan, babe. I'm gonna do it at the same time. It's so... Text. Yes. What? I got the meeting. Honey, that's wonderful. I know. They wanna schedule for next week. Baby, I'm so proud of you. This is a big deal, honey. It's the Umbrella Corporation. If I get this, I won't have to consult for anyone again. And you won't have to work the corners anymore. Baby, you've worked so hard for this. Thank you. Hey, you feel like christening the new house? Well, the kids are asleep. You know how to turn me on. Yeah? Wanna move some boxes, baby? The only box I'm interested in is yours. Either one of you losers might wanna take care of this. You should get out. Mommy and Daddy are playing gardener. Order a pizza. Unh. Mushrooms? Green peppers and mushrooms. First full night in this house, total awesomeness. Let me get this here. There we go. - What? What? What is this mess? - Who tossed around all the furniture? Liz, what the hell happened here? Don't know. I was just about to post my nudes on Twitter... and then I came in here and saw this. Baby? Dana? What the hell? Who redecorated the room? You know, it's actually pretty nice, in a retro kind of way. Honey, it looks like Neil Patrick Harris threw up in here. For christ sakes. My God. Wait. What? Dana doesn't know how to cook. Where did all this food come from? Aaron, what the hell is going on here? Yeah, Dad, this is fucking weird. But for some reason, I wanna shoot it. I don't know what this is either. Could be your classic suburban burglar... or a practical joke by Martha Stewart. You're wrong on both counts. Heh. It's just sweet old me, Paula Bean. I just wanted y'all to taste my new low-fat recipe. Hey. Sorry I'm late. You guys shooting a reality show or something? No. No, that's my daughter Liz. Hi, babe. Hey, sunshine. You like things that dangle? We're gonna saturate this space with cameras. Okay? I'm gonna put one up in that corner. Right? That way you get it coming this way. One up in this corner, opposite direction. Boom. One from the dining room. Bam. Triangulation of coverage. Put one over the stove, right, get it pointed this way. One on top of the TV, pointed this way. That way we get the full coverage in here, okay? All right, yeah. That's good. Okay. I forgot to put this on the list. You can install a camera on this? No. To fuck on. Then I install a camera. Ha-ha-ha! Okay, there's more house. Let's go. We got one directly above the crib and the one over here up the bunny's ass. Hey. This seems sturdy, right? Good for a nice blowing, right? You just slide in between the slats and then... We'll get another one right here coming in. We got this one pointed directly this way and then one directly over the bed. Wait, why our bed? Don't worry about it. Look at this fucking great bathroom. Shit, this is fucking beautiful. We're gonna stick one here pointed at the bathtub. We got one high in this corner, directed at the shower. And then one in the toilet. Excuse me? What are you doing in my shower? Get out, out, out. Really? Sorry. These are my nieces. I love the pool heaters. Morning, honey. Somebody slept in this morning. I like sleeping. Especially when it's sweet dreams about you. Hi. What is that? What? There's writing on your face. Yeah, I do that every night. It's good for the skin. What the hell is going on here? And this is exactly why we have cameras, so we can get to the bottom of this stuff. What the... My God. My God, honey, we have ghosts. Okay, okay. No, honey, it's okay. I think you're being a little over dramatic. I'm sorry, really? What would you call that? It could be a million different things. Like what? Could be the air conditioning, window was left open. Scientologists. No. I am sorry, honey, those are ghosts and I am freaking out right now. Okay, Dana. Dana, look at me. Calm down, okay? They're not ghosts. There is no such thing as ghosts. Trust me. Okay, fine. Attention, all ghosts. If you're here with us right now in this house... for the love of Jesus, give us a sign. Okay. I guess you're right, honey. Goddamn Scientologists. I just don't understand why this is happening to us. I think I do. What? It all started when I was 7. I was getting drunk with my sister. We'd use tiny teacups, that way our parents never knew. Don't put that there. Why? Because Jeremy's sitting there. Jillian, you gotta stop with this ghost thing. You sound crazy. I'm not crazy, I'm just telling you the truth. Sorry, Jillian, that one was a little tougher to pinch off. Facial. Okay. Tea me up. But Jeremy Lin wasn't even a Knick back then and I didn't know you had a sister. She was deported to Guatemala when I was 10. But that's not the point. The point is that 2 years after that... my father killed the entire cast of The Artist... including Uggie the dog. Why? That was a great movie. Frankly, I don't understand why the whole film had to be silent. But anyway... it wasn't until I was 20 years old that I found out my father killed those people... during an exorcism. What? I know. It's crazy? Yeah. He's been in a psychiatric hospital in ltaly ever since. Who's the person that walked you down the aisle and comes over for the holidays? Sweetie. He's just an actor. His name's Joel Solomon. He's very talented. I called him Pop-Pop. Listen, I... I really think we should call in the Ghost Brothers. No way. Honey, those guys are scam artists. You know that. No. Okay. Are you coming to bed? Not yet, I'm only halfway done with this, honey. I need at least 45 more minutes. Babe, I've missed your touch. It's long since we... I know, it's all gone. Let's get something to eat. Let's get some milk. What the...? I just bought 2 containers of milk. Who drank it all? Hello, we are the Ghost Brothers, here to investigate. It is so thick in here, dude. So many ghosts in the air! I know what you mean. It's like we're breathing in ghosts. Dude, I am choking on a ghost right now. - I am choking on a ghost. - Spit that ghost out. Spit that ghost out right now. Spit it out! I'll punch it out if you want! Guys! You guys are professionals, right? Yeah, 100 percent. We even have business cards. Call me the middle man. There you go. Super legit. Call us because we're always open. Daily. Did you hear that? That TV just turned on! We're gonna die. Here we go, let's go. Rack them up, dude. This is what we've been training for. I turned it on.

Dude, there are 57 ghosts in that bathroom over there. What? Where are you getting these numbers from? A ghost was just born in my hand. What do we do? Flamboyant scream? Duh. Stop it! Stop! My God! My God! My God! Ooh. Seriously? This is what you brought into our house? All right, so we found about 70 ghosts in your house total. in your bedroom. Also, it's our day off, so we charge double for that. So, whatever you guys think is fair. So, basically, free? I was thinking moreover, like, $3. Fine, deal. Go. Thank you so much. Hell, yeah. If you need us, we will be in our van, watching the perimeters. A door doesn't wake you? You deaf? I knew I had to step up my game... or I'd get kicked out of the house. I love the pool cleaners. I love the pool cleaners. I love the pool cleaners. Do the left nut. Left nut. My hair. There's something about the way You do your thing I can't take my eyes off you. - Liz, you have a visitor. - What the...? Good morning, young lady. Hey. I was just looking for my earring. There it is. Who said you could come to my room? Well, I apologize for barging in. Your mother gave me permission. Well, what if I didn't want you to come up? I had a sneaking suspicion... you did. And how's that? By the very way you were staring at me. Say what? I wasn't staring at you, dude. I was writing in my journal. Look, I don't know what you want, but I'm really busy.

There are certain things you can do to... How you say? To win him over. Like what? It's called "Roofie and Bang." A "Roofie and Bang"? Just put one of those in his Amaretto Sours and he's yours for the rest of the night. And the best thing is that they wake up the next morning... not knowing I stuck my cheese between their crackers.
