You're late! - I had some shit I had to take care of. - She's a ho, Steven. Sooner you get that through your head, the better for you. Just give me the money. You're angry? Is it because of me or your ho? After all this time together, you're not trusting me? This is our last transaction. Got a better source. Same grade, cheaper. JoJo? Oh, Jesus Christ. JoJo is small time, man. His sources aren't even stable. I didn't think you were this fucking stupid. He gave me the same exact grade as yours. Probably because he got it from me. He's selling it to you for a low cost for now. The price is going to come up, the quality's going to go down. He's just a fucking small-time piece of shit. Got his hands in everything... girls, money. Yeah, I know. That's how I met your girlfriend. Angel, right? What a fine piece of ass. But don't worry, it was like a couple years ago, before she met you. When she was still fresh. JoJo's giving me 10% off your cut. - Take five, and I'll stick with you. - You take your 5% and go fuck yourself. I don't think you realize who you're dealing with. I know exactly who I'm talking to, motherfucker. Daddy's little boy. Hey, you're one fast motherfucker, but I still got a sniper out there. 10% is all it took for you to fuck me over. Come on, man. It's business. Yeah, it is business. But what you said about Angel, that's personal. Act surprised, okay? No, stupid. How do you do this? Here he comes, here he comes. Surprise! Thank you. Thank you. - Happy Birthday. - Happy Birthday. - Thank you. - I hate being married to a detective. - Your band sucks. - That's 'cause our lead singer can't sing. Then why is he the lead singer? 'Cause it's his studio, and he owns all the equipment. Guess it makes sense. Let's say you skip your band practice tonight and have dinner with the old man? - Okay. - Great. You go ahead. I'll take the kids to school. Thanks. Happy 50th, old man. Old woman found her. Euro-Asian, late teens. M.E. is working on time and cause of death. It's gonna be difficult. Anything else? Nothing yet. Divers are searching. It's going to take another couple hours. Visibility down there is nil. Give me a smoke, man. - It's been, like, four years. - Just give me a cigarette. Her name's Angel. No last name. Everyone has a last name. Not if your father's a ghost. I'm gonna need a few personal days. You have reached the Balloon Catering Service. Please leave a message. I'm in town. Meet me at the usual place. Sorry, I couldn't resist. I can't believe they've turned this place into this. Yeah. Well, the war's been... over for a long time, so... a playground is better than a cemetery. So why are you here? Something to tell me? Angel's dead. Her body was discovered early yesterday morning off the river, Klong Bangkok Noi. She was found naked. Her wrists were bound. I'm sorry. I have a plan. I'll head back and work the case, and you follow in. And stay off the radar. And then? By the time you land... I should have some leads for us to start with. - Your partner? - Yeah, he's a good cop. If there are any leads, he'll have 'em. And then? And then you do whatever you want. But until we find the people responsible, you play by my rules. So... how is Ploy? She's doing well. She's a senior VP now. You know, you don't have to do this, Peter. I can handle this myself, you know that. - I mean, you got a family. You got a... - Hey, we do this together. And your friend? Is he coming? Yes. I think his daughter was mixed up in a lot of gray stuff. Her father and I were recruited by the CIA... as locals. - We met during training. - Air America? How fucking old do you think I am? We became Americans and joined the military. We came back 12 years later. I became a cop, and he went private. - Blackwater? - There's no such thing anymore. - What else do you have? - She has a titanium rod in her forearm. Doc says it's about a couple years old. Only a few hospitals could do it. So where's your friend? I love you. Forgot how humid it gets here. Meet my partner, Karn. He's tracked down some potential perps. We've got three. This guy... Her boyfriend or her friend's boyfriend? Her friend's. Crystal and Patrick. She's half Thai, he's Turkish. They've been living here for the past six years. She didn't have a boyfriend? Not one that I found, no. Karn believes that the two will be in Khao San tonight. There are a couple of bars they like to frequent. - Johnny. - I know. - No, you don't. - I do know. I'm very aware of where I am about to step into. But believe me... as a cop who's been investigating sex crimes for 20 years... and a father of three young children, and as your friend... Johnny... I know we've seen some dark, weird shit, but this is your own daughter. I understand. Okay. Karn, you track Crystal and Patrick. I know where to track Steven now. That's him. We go in here, we go in hard. These guys don't fuck around. Can I help you? I'm looking for a Crystal Logan, Room C 23. Do you have a warrant? I'll call for backup. - Everything good? - Yes, boss. It's all quiet. Man, where have you been? Jesus, you just don't fucking get it. Do you know what we have sitting here? Hey! Drop it. How we looking? Everything's ready. We're just waiting for you to make the calls. Listen, wrong way, mate. Turn around and jog on. I'll blow your fucking head off! Finally. I'll see you at the usual place. Police! I don't want you to go. You know I have to. - Stay with me. - I really... I really do have to go. I love you. That's sweet. "Sweet"? Yeah? I'm not fucking sweet! All right. Let's split up. Karn, you check out the other places. Welcome to Khao San. We're going to meet someone who usually knows everything that goes on around here. That's her. Excuse me. May I sit down and ask you some questions? I'm always happy to help the local police. Please sit. Your friend isn't a cop. - No, he's not. - Who is he? He's my friend. Am I being charged for anything or is this just a friendly chat? It's a friendly chat. Crystal, Angel, and Patrick. Good kids. All three of them. Why is a high-ranking police officer looking for them? How do you know them? Answer my question please. This is Angel's father. Her body was found three days ago. I'm so sorry. You knew her well? Angel was a lovely girl. I liked her a lot. - I liked her a lot. - Thank you. Can you help us? - Angel came to me three years ago. - Three years ago... - She came to see me. - ...she came to see me. - She was looking for customers. - She was looking for customers. - At first I sent her away... - I chased her away... - ...but she was persistent. - ...but she was very stubborn. She didn't want any middle man. She didn't need any middle man with nothing to lose. You mean pimps? She wanted a quick way in. She wanted a quick way in. Did you hook her up? No. But that didn't stop her. - No, but it didn't stop her. - And you said you liked her. - But you didn't help her? - To be used by other men? - So she could be used by men? - No. No. - Did you know your daughter? - Do you know your daughter well? - What Angel wants. - Anything Angel wants... - She has to get. - ...she has to get. Did you give her your contacts? I left that world a long time ago. My contacts would be useless to her. - But you knew people? - I did. Angel did it herself. I've never seen anyone move up in the trade so fast. I've never seen anyone come in this fast. - Beautiful. - She's a beautiful girl. Very smart. And very smart. A lot of men came for her. - She had protection from the bigwigs. - But she had protection from bigwigs. - But there was one that stood out. - But there was one that stood out. And what was his name? JoJo. He operates around this area. They like to target young backpackers. Lady backpackers or foreigners who need money. Nothing there. A couple of regulars recognized them, but didn't really know who they were. Hey, excuse me. You guy... You two look a bit lost. How can I help you? - We're okay, thank you. - Oh, come on. You look like you can use some coffee and a sandwich. Hey, my friend have a restaurant over there. If you change your mind, you can come to join me. The purple sign. - What do you think? - Why not? It's a public place. Hey! How long before your flight leaves? Your flight out of Bangkok? How many days do you have to wait? Three days. Take it. Go get yourself a decent room. And order in, stay in until you have to leave for the airport. Understood? Take it. Take it and go. What can I do you for gentlemen? You know her? Yeah, she comes around here all the time. That's... Angel. She's usually with... Patrick and Crystal. And when was the last time you saw them? - About a week ago. - And the other two? Two or three days ago. - Angel wasn't with them? - No. You have a very good memory. Yeah. She's a good kid. I like her. A bit lost sometimes, but she always pays her bills and never gives me any trouble. When you own a bar, that's all you can ask from your customers. - Where can I find them? - I don't know. You can try here later. How much later? Later. You gonna close me down? I just want to find Crystal and the boyfriend, - ask them a few questions. - What about Angel? She's dead. Well, shame. She was a nice kid. - Anything else I can do for you guys? - Thanks. What about your friend? Let's go find him. JoJo... have you seen him? I haven't seen him for a couple of night. - Well, when you see him, you let me know. - Okay, sir. The fuck was that? I don't know. What the fuck is that, man? - Two bitches coming. - Yeah? Yeah. One blonde, and one I think brunette. Don't see them well. - Make some money or what? - Yeah. I found JoJo. Those other two worked with him. I said under the fucking radar. How am I going to cover this up? Give me your gun. I mean it, Johnny. Your gun. Now. - The other one, too. - You want to pat me down? The way I see it, JoJo got into an argument with his two friends, - got shot... - JoJo was not shot. He had a... heart attack. His body is completely clean. You're not going to find any prints. JoJo worked for a few establishments in Patpong. He recruits for them, him and his two other guys sometimes help breaking in the women that he recruits. And you can find his iPhone on him with names, contacts, pictures, video clips. He said he knew Angel. He said one of his bosses used to be her boyfriend. A certain Khun Nate can be found at a bar called Badabing. - What? - I'm sorry. You shouldn't be involved in this, man. I work for the Royal Thai police force just like you. I've sworn to protect the city. And as far as I'm concerned, it's my job. I'll call it in. I'll take care of it. You give him your weapon, I'll have your badge. - Do you understand that? - Yes, sir. Wherever he goes, I want you to go. He takes a piss, I want you holding his fucking dick. Do you understand? Now can I trust you to stay in the car while I handle this? You have my word. Bit of an incident. Where's JoJo? I want to talk to him. JoJo won't be a problem for us anymore. You need to leave town until these feds are gone. It could be bad for business. Just for a couple of days. Don't worry, I'll take care of it all. Wait for me at one of those bars. I'll be back within... 20 minutes. I'll see you in a few. Miss, can I get a cola please? Minimal but good security, four to six guys, about 20% capacity. Music's extremely loud. Look, I got a untraceable six-shooter in the glove compartment in the car. There are armed men in there. Yeah. I know. I can't go in there with you. I know. You've done more than enough. I'm going to go get another Coke then. I prefer it out of the can anyway. Yeah? Go get me your manager. Okay? Can I help you, sir? I'm looking for Khun Nate. JoJo sent me, and he said that Khun Nate would have what I'm looking for. - What is it that you're looking for? - Well, that's between him and I. You think a couple of thousand baht can get you to see Khun Nate? Well, you think JoJo would send me here if all I had was a couple thousand bahts? Go get him. Forget it. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. Got to be careful, you know. If JoJo sent you, you must be solid. You know how we Thai men can be. JoJo is Japanese. Follow me. Wait here. Shut up! I'm going to ask you a few questions, and you better give it to me straight, you understand? What was your relationship with Angel? I'm in love with her. You're married. You love your wife, too? Was Angel in love with you? - So you killed her? - What? She's dead? - And you are? - He's my father. How long have you been seeing her? - Three years. - Where did you meet her? My Egg. My Egg nightclub. Members only. I was invited to this place. You get a card. No names, no numbers. It's the only way. The card's in my wallet. What kind of a club? It's a sex club. Hello? Not even 12 hours, you rack up 15 bodies. - How the fuck do you do that? - Don't fucking touch me. Okay? Don't. Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead. I put my job on the line for you. I endangered the lives of my family. And for what, you selfish son of a bitch? Do you realize what you're doing to me? Do you even fucking care? My daughter was a whore, Peter. Do you know what that is doing to me? Do you? So... good to finally meet you, Ploy. I'm so sorry for your loss. Me too. - Daddy! - Come here. Baby. Say hello to your Uncle Johnny. Hello, Uncle Johnny. Are you my daddy's friend? Yes, I am. You must be Annie. Good girl, here. - I need to eat more... broccoli? - You eat what's on your plate. It's time to go tell Sarah. Hello, Sarah. Johnny? Angel is dead. She was murdered, Sarah. - Do you know why? - How would I know that? - You're her mother. - And you're her father. But I don't live in this country. No shit. You know she moved out two years ago, right? When was the last time you saw her? Sometimes... Sometimes I really miss you. Do you miss me? No. Ironically, that's the thing I miss the most about you. You never lie. You packed your bags and left, Sarah. Took my only child with you. Why would I miss you? Please let me know about the funeral arrangements. I'd like to see her... just to... Karn's located the rest of the suspects. We end this tonight. - Her friends are at Angel's house. - And these were her closest friends? They're holed up in a three-bedroom house off of Klong Bangkok Yai. It's about two kilometers from where the body was discovered. Hey, wake him up. They're up. I'm Angel's father, and this is her godfather. You know my daughter, correct? She... she's my best friend. This is her house? Where is she? Where is she? I don't know. We seen her, like... - a week ago. She... - Where? She came to get some stuff. - What? - Some coke. And that's it? And you haven't seen her since? - No. - But yet, you're here in her place? I have her keys. She has my keys. - Because you're friends? - Yeah. She's dead. How? She was murdered, her body dumped into these waters, found about a mile from here. I'm sorry. - Can you help us? - Anything. Do you know anyone... who would want my daughter dead? A lot of guys were crazy about her, you know? But... she was a smart girl. She... she knew her way around. Did you work with her? Yes. - Where you going? - I'm going to get some coffee. Sit down. Now, Crystal, we need names. She had some regulars, but no one special. Steven wasn't special? She liked the guy, but she wasn't in love. - Who did she love? - I don't know. You don't know? You're her best friend. How can you not know someone important in her life? You're her father. I only just met you. Who is he Crystal? - It was Sammy. - Bangkok Bar Sammy? He was the only one that she was in love with. I don't know. He didn't even have that much money. And that's all that matters? What else do men have to offer? - Thank you. - I'm sorry. Son of a bitch lied to me, man. Let's go find out why. You kill my daughter? Did you kill Angel? Did you? I loved Angel with all my being. This whole situation is a mistake. I have nothing against either one of you. You just killed my partner. Look... You and me, we're very much alike. I lost my daughter when she was 15 years old. Her name was Lisa. She was on holiday in Manila at the time with her mother. I was in Kosovo with my regiment. Day after day, month after month... year after year, I was always a step behind. And I never saw my little girl again. So, I understand your loss. I wake up every morning hoping that maybe, just maybe today will be the day that I hear her voice one more time. And then I go to bed at night wondering if she's out there being raped for the thousandth time. No father should have to go through that. Is that why you're making a fortune out of the very thing that destroyed your daughter? I honor her memory by protecting these women, these women that the very fabric of society was built upon. With or without me, men will always use the backs of women for their own gratification. There's a reason this is the oldest fucking business in the world. I elevate these women. You can ask any one of my girls. I treat them all with respect. I loved Angel so much. I treated her better than my own daughter. You broke her arm. - That was a mistake. - You seem to be making lots of them. - That was an accident. - And like Angel. - I didn't kill Angel. - Of course not. You only snapped her arm. She was fucking another man... in my home! So she deserved to die? No. I tried to protect her. I did everything I could. She was so young... so beautiful, so fragile. But she was too smart for her own good. I did the best I could for her. Like you did for Lisa? Look at me. Look at me. You better kill me now. 'Cause if you don't... I'm going to hunt you down... and I'm going to kill you. You understand? Gentlemen. I hope I never see either one of you ever again. Wait. Do you know how she died? Yeah. I do. We're going to get him. Did Karn have a family? Yeah. A mother in California. He was right, Peter. If I didn't want to be found, could you find me? No, but you can. - Now what? - One last place. My Egg. Gentlemen. Follow me please. Membership is two million bahts a year. Drinks are complimentary. And everything else, you pay as you go. Tell me. What does this get us for the night? Pretty much whatever you want. Young. I like them young. We specialize in that, too. - How young? - How young do you go? You know there is more where that came from. Of course there is. It will be half a million for the both of you. They better be real ones. Now if these girls aren't what you claim them to be, there'll be hell to pay. Do you understand? I can assure you that here, we do not resort to any tricks. You will get what you pay for. These are the youngest four we have on site. Roofies? Ambien. Keeps them conscious and active. We give them two doses. Completely harmless. They even wake up without a hangover. Why don't you go talk to your boss, see what kind of deal he can cut us for the four. But we want them all night. Come morning, if we're satisfied, we'll pay cash for the membership. Okay. Tell me about Angel. Who the fuck are you? I'm her father. Yeah, I can see why she left home. Don't tell me. You're another one who loved her, too? She's dead. - How? - Murdered. And you think I did it? - She was seeing someone else. - I was the someone else! You okay with all that? You fucked up as a father and now your daughter's dead. Are you okay with that? You're going to tell me everything you know about Angel. Why don't you put your gun down... and see if you can beat it out of me. You are... gonna tell me everything you know about Angel. Fuck you. This is gonna hurt. - Okay, okay. Please. - Tell me about Angel. She used to work here, but she left over years ago. - We don't have anything to do with her. - Did you recruited her? No. She came to me on her own, and then she left. - So you just let her go? - She knows people. She knew people. I liked her. You think this fancy dress can hide a country girl from Vietnam? Who would want to kill her? Who? I don't know. Many people liked her. She's the kind of woman that all men kill for. You men are simple creatures. She understood that. She used it. She knows how to use men... better than anyone I've seen. She met someone. Who? I don't know. But it changed her. How did he change her? She left this place. Almost all her clients complained because she dumped them. They spent more time and money here in the hopes they'd find a replacement. They never could. No one was like Angel. What are you going to do now? You're not going to wake up with a hangover either. I need you to fix up my friend. Peter. You come see me after so long time? - Hello, Mekael. - Mickey. How many time I tell you call me Mickey? Like the little mouse, da? You bring friend. Look like he make someone's husband angry? Oh, it's not knife. Ice pick? Oh, you black ops all the same, eh? So tough. Fucking Rambo, eh? Drink. Helps. This one real-deal black op. I don't think we'll see Rambo. My own concoction. He sleep for an hour, he feel nothing. But when he wake up, you give him this. Painkiller. Take all four. Have to disinfect all the way through. I'm surprised you have not heard from our friend yet. Why? Because she owns the club you destroyed last night. Feels better. It should. He knows what he's doing. Russian? Thought you left that world when you came back here. - We better get going. - Where to? You remember where I get my information? You lied to us. So the noodle bar is just a front? You better tell us what we want to hear or I'll shut down everything, including the noodle bar. What's your connection to Steven? He was my business partner. He left you for my daughter? If that were the case... she would have been dead a long time ago, and you would have never found her body. But I did not kill her. She was like a sister to me. - What do you want? - I need you to leave Bangkok. You have made things really difficult for me. What do you want in exchange? Do you want to know how Angel died? You know how Angel died? No, she doesn't. I have it on tape. Sammy uploaded a clip from Patrick's phone onto his laptop. Do you know where it is? In the car. Johnny. This isn't your fault. Fuck! Don't... don't stop breathing. She isn't... she isn't breathing. She isn't breathing. She... No! She's not...
