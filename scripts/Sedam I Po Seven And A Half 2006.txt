This, over there... I've kissed a girl there for the first time, she dumped me soon after the first cramps. And that shot that put you in the God's lap. Where the rest of us, simple and sad... ...will never be. Dear Armando, my name is Bojan Maric, I look like an ordinary guy... ...but unfortunately, that's not true. - Fuck! Why are you laughing, jerk?! Let's do it again! I know you too have broken your leg in Barcelona, and you know how hard it is when you're disabled. T-shirt looks great ...Just imagine... ...when it lasts for 17 years! You should take the hat off. I think this is genial! Here, my dear Diego, I made my first, and by the look of it, my last football steps. Yeah! - Sorry, Diego! You are coming close to me. Closer, closer... it's there. Stop! Just don't get out of my zoom, ok? - Ok. Let's start. There's a cure for my vicious disease at the Moscow clinic. A team of experts led by the famous professor P... Prokofiev! ...Prokofiev! They perform surgeries which guarantee complete recovery in 90 percent of the cases. And all that would be so lovely, if I had enough money for that operation. Situation in Serbia is similar, maybe even worse... - Worse! ...than in Argentina. For us, Just stay in the zoom. Keboya, bro! - Yeah, bro? - I've been thinking... Never mind. - C'mon, tell me! - Never mind, forget it! - Speak! What's 15 grand to Maradona? He got loaded in Barsa, he slottered Napoli, destroyed Seville! He's worth millions, bro! - But he was spending a lot. What? Where?! - He spent it on cocaine, women, alcohol! C'mon! Everything in Argentina is free for him. He spends summers at Fidel's, and winters with Kusturica! Let's not fuck around! - Should we ask him for 16 Gs? Keboya, 20 grand! - C'mon, man! - 20 grand, bro, just like that! Hello? Bro, I'm sleeping... Wait a second. It's 4 a.m.! Are you insane?! Who's calling at this hour? - Radule. He'll drop by. Now? - Yeah, mom. We have to work! Work? - Yes, mom! Now! - At 4 a.m.?! - Yes! What do you want from me?! When I'm not working, you're bitching, when I am, you're bitching again! What do you want?! - God, save this poor mother! No, bro! - You're absolutely right. - Of course I'm right! - Of course it's nothing! We'll buy a Golf each, and then I'll have to borrow for registration! - How much should we ask for? My dear Diego, 30 grand is nothing for you. And it means a world to me. My health... - C'mon, bro! What's with you! Come here! I've been thinking. - What's up? - Golf is a Golf. But Mercedes... We should ask for 35 grand, ok? Keboya, bro... I think you are awesome! Who did your hair? I did it myself. Why? - It's great, man! Really. Come here! It looks fantastic on you! Excellent! And how much money did you ask from him? - 40 grand. What?! - 40,000 Euros. Why? - Are you fucking insane? You think it's a lot? - It's not enough, my son! You think? - Of course! He's Mr. Nice Guy! He'll give everything to the poor. - 40 grand, my God! He's gonna think you're jerking his chain! You can't go to Russia without Are you insane! Fuck! - Why haven't you asked Beckham? C'mon! He's English, he's cheap. He'll rather die, than give us any money. You're a blast! Where did you find Beckham?! - And with treatment expenses, and residence costs in Moscow it comes to one hundred... ...and twenty... five... ...and a half thousand dollars! American! - Stop! You are a doll! I want you to be a little more decisive! Give it to me. And ask for 130 grand, ok? - Ok. - Let's do it again. Don't you see that we almost fucked this up? - It's nothing. - Way too little. I've been calculating. Two Mercedes' are 90 grand. This is for technical things, amortization and that shit... What's this? - This is for my water heater. - Heater?! And what's this? - Just a little something for my mom. Look now... - And my mom? - Excellent! Bro, your mom! Another grand. We're left with 60 grand, give or take 5. Let's see... 200 grand... What would you do if you were Maradona, and some kid was asking for 200 grand for an operation? Would you have given it to him? - No. - How come? I wouldn't, bro! Nobody gave me anything in life! That's why you're not Maradona! And you're rottening with your folks, like a burnout! - Yeah, right! What's this? - Foreign currency account. When did you open it? - Today. Cool... - Naturally. Why are you bringing me to a construction site, maniac?! Maniac will build you a house! - C'mon... - Work well, man! All this will be ours one day. and here a nursery. I hate kids! - You learn to love them. Look at the view! Can you see it? It's all ours, don't you get it?! I'm not so sure... - What's wrong? Keboya, bro! You're great! You are a genius! But I think I'll do better as Maradona. You are awesome! But you're missing something deep. - You look like him? No, but listen! You don't have that sadness in your eyes. Bro... We'll do Colina with you. - Fuck you! Don't you get it? You look exactly like him! We'll use it to buy a house! - Stop shitting me! Dear Diego... ...I have cancer, and I'm undergoing chemotherapy. I'm just not so pathetic like my friend is. This is the real account that you should send money to. Help the real guy. Excuse me, young lady... What's the value of the shipment? - 280,000 Euros! What's in there? - Just wait one minute... Bro... maybe we should ask for 300 grand? No! It's over! We did it! We're sending it! It's over! You were right, bro! enough. - Have to keep it real. We did a great job! Sergio, you bastard! - That's Liovisna's fiancee. But he's two timing her with Concita, and that pisses my mom. Sergio... We didn't translate it into Spanish... Open it! What the hell are you doing?! - Shut the fuck up! Search! Just to let you know, I've called the police! - Fuck off! Look for the fucking package, bro! Bro... After severe heart attack, Diego Armando Maradona has been transfered to the hospital Estavez in Buenos Aires last night... Radoje... ANGER Tadic! I'm the strongest!

He's gonna bury him! - Whom? - Spahija! He'll destroy him. Smash him. I'm sorry I'm disturbing your afternoon rest, fuck! But I haven't been taking tranquilizers for the 3 whole days, and I'm very crazy! There is more! Yesterday Spahija came out of the can! If somebody sees that fuck, tell him that Tadija is waiting for him in the gym! C'mon, Hare Krishna... I'm not Hare Krishna! - Don't tell me! All of you living in Gandhi's street are fucking Indians! Who was Gandhi? Tell me! Fucking Indian! Hare, Hare! Krishna, Krishna! Gandhi, Gandhi! Hare, Hare! Hare, Hare! Krishna, Krishna! Gandhi, Gandhi! Hare, Hare! And you livin' in Gagarin's street are cool, right? Gagarin was the first man in space, my son! Russian, Orthodox! He took a crap on all of you Indians! Watch out, here comes the real Orthodox piece of shit, right out from space! - Gagarin wasn't Ortodox. Really? What was he? Hare Krishna? - Communist! My father was a comunist too, and now he's Orthodox, jerk! Isn't it so, uncle Miki? You were a comunist, and now you are Ortodox, right? - I don't know, my son. I live in Nehru's street. - Jesus! Another Indian! Gandhi wasn't Indian. Indians live in America, and Hindus live in India! Come 'ere, I'll bust your face! Tadija, don't! Bro, do you need some milk? - Tomorrow! Today is a fruit day. Tell me, where do you live? - In Youth Brigades street. Yeah! That's it! My Orthodox darling! Let me kiss your boob! Now it's time for uncle Tadia's rest. Maybe we'll fuck tomorrow. Don't get all excited! It's not a promise. Tadic! I'm the strongest! My son! Just one more! I'll do it myself! - Ok. Is it true that he was skinny? - Who? - Tadija. Yes, son. Skinny like a stick. Good for nothing. What the fuck... Spahija sent him to buy some cigarettes, he refused. And Spahija broke his nose. Then Spahija went down, and Tadija started going to the gym. He's been waiting for this day, for 5 years! Skinny like a stick... And now, he's the strongest in the hood. I'll be like that one day! Look, son! You don't get to be the strongest by exercising. Yeah? - Chemistry, my son, chemistry... But chemistry isn't healthy. It stays in your organism. Who gives a fuck! You just take a crap in the morning, and it's all gone. But I'm always taking a crap in the evening. - How come? Don't know what to tell you, s0n. Something is wrong with you I must say that I owe all this... Only to me! I didn't have any help from sponsors or... what's it called? Help from the community! - Today is your milk day, right? Is there any chocolate milk? No? What about cookies? - I'm sorry, man! I'm stupid. Yes, you are! Chocolate milk, bananas and cookies! Run! ...59,60! Krishna I've heard you've been takinga crap in the morning? Well, yes... - Bro, I'm sorry. I'm really stupid. - Koki? You're still here? - No. - No? - Yes. And what are you waiting for? Money? - Nnn... no. No? - Yes. - Listen, darlin', if I had money, I could buy all that myself! Be inventive, Koviljka! There's jungle out there! Krishna, are you mad? - Why? - Where did you hear that body builders are taking a crap in the morning?! - When, then? When every real champion does it! In the high noon! Count! - Bro... Now I don't even know when to take a crap! What did you say? - Nothing. Did you called me,, bro", or was I imagining things?! You were imagining... Listen, we could never be brothers. Spahija can be your bro. He's from Gandhi's street. He's Indian! Tadija Tadic is a son of Serbia, and you are his enemies. And that's why Tadija Tadic is gonna take revenge for Kosovo, Milos Obilic, Tzar Lazar, and the greatest of all! Tzarina Milica! Tadiiic! I'm the strongest! Koviljka! - Hey, Koviljka!

Good for you, Koki! Everything for love, hey? Love will conquer all! - You're such jerks! Wait, Koki! Have a drink with us! I hear he wants to beat Spahija. - Yeah, bro! He's gonna kill him! - What are you drinking? - Soda. And where is it? What's wrong, little Indians? Do you use chemistry? My poor little Krishna... I drank the whole factory! Take a break, man! - Let me be, bro. I'm burning my fat! I'm fucking nervous when I'm fat! I'm mad! Take some traquilizers, bro! Don't bark on me! Like a fucking chivava! What should I start with? - With this! I say, milk! Gallons and gallons of it, every day! I say, cookies! I say eggs, potatoes! And stakes! And, of course, steroids rule! That's the best to begin with. So... I say, steroids! The mass comes in first, 'cause mass is the mother of it all! Being massive is stupid. Definition rules! Go, then! And work on the construction! You'll be defined! Just like all those poor guys! Carry some sacks! - I don't wanna be like them. I'll do it nicely, so you can see every muscle. Like the Master, over there. Look at him! There's no fat, pure muscle, ligament and tendons. You want me to tell you who Bruce Lee was? He was a pussy! Chinese! Ass! Indian! He should be smuggling clothes, and selling shoes for 3 Euros! - Why are you so pissed? Hello, countryman! Where's your mass, fucking cunt!? You fucking Chinese joke! That's what he is! A joke! He was Japanese... - Listen... Spahija is in the cafe. And you are telling me now? Now?! Ok... Weeks are passing by, your weight increases, muscles get bigger and bigger, wanting more and more. And then you surprise them. By an amino acid shot! You still increase the weights. At that time, your dick won't work. Not for a few weeks. Fuck it, you have to pay, bro! Not like that cunt, Bruce Lee. Taking cocaine and fucking every night! That's no athlete! When you realise you would kick your father's ass for not saying Good Morning, you leave the steroids. You go on food, 10 eggs, tons of milk, everything. Then it's time for amphetamins. You go nights without sleeping, and you're so fucking strong! You go to the gym 3 times a day! Pushing garbage cans all the way to the river bank and back. And you fuck like it's Christmas! If you have someone to fuck. If not, just push those cans! Fuck it! And then you know you're ready. When you spend 5 years in the gym Hell. When your arms are hams, and your body a steel safe, when you kill with your left hand, and your right hand gives you chills... Then you know that you're ready to kill Spahija. Ready to kill fucking Indian from Gandhi's street. To bust his nose! Make him bleed! To brake his nose! So he could know! What's it like when everybody's laughing at you! To cry through your puberty! Not having a date! When you're having insomnia! When, at age of 15, you're snoring like an old fart! - So help you God! Skinny Bones, you grew up? Now you're Fat Bones. But you're missing a bone. Tadic! I'm the strongest! - You're very big. But I've heard your balls got tiny. And your dick is like a worm. - I'll kill you! I've heard you've been waiting to beat me for 5 years? I ain't gonna beat you. I'm gonna kill you! Fine, Skinny Bones! But first, show me your dick. C'mon! - I'll kill you! I'll kill you, Spahija! So what if it's small. Women don't care about the size. - I'll kill you. I'll kill ya! - Yeah, right. Your sister liked it big. She liked it hard! She was a real whore, first class! She would jump on your cock, and scream like Dorothy! Tadija! LUS Hi, my name is Marina... I'm twelve, I'm in the fifth grade, I like to draw and write. My favourite subjects are history, geography and literature, of course. Recently I moved to Blok 70, New Belgrade, so I don't have lots of friends around here. My dad is a clerk, and my mom works in the supermarket. They tell me all the time that I should have more friends but I have none. I would truly like to meet some friends this way, with whom I could spend some time off. Leave a message, I'm not available right now... Hello, my son. I've been trying to find you all day. Desa, from the sixth floor have rented the room to a young, and they say beautiful lady doctor, so I've been thinking, why don't you come over and meet her? Obrad, my son! Are you deliberately avoiding me? The lady doctor asked about You... Hi, I'm Tanja, and I'm 11. I'm also lonely and unhappy because I'm in love with Boris from the sixth grade. But he loves this Tamara, which is disgusting by my opinion! I would really like to meet you, as soon as possible. Hi, Tanja. Great that you replied. Can't wait to meet you. To talk about stupid teachers, boys, parents and stuff. To drink soda's and eat pancakes. Hope you like them, 'cause I make great pancakes. Are you free tomorrow? Afternoon. - Afternoon. How can I help you? - Excuse me? Looking for something? - I must have made a mistake... Stojcic, sixth floor? - Yes, that's me. And who might you be? I'm Tanja's dad. - Tanja...? Of course, Tanja's dad! Yes, Yes... Me, I'm a dad too. Little... Yes, I'm Marina's father. Please, come in. - Thanks. And where's little Tanja? - She's near by. Don't get me wrong, I thought I should check on you first. You know, these days... There are lots of maniacs around. I perfectly understand. As you've said it, the times now... And where is... - Marina? She's here. I mean not here, she went to the store to buy some sweets. Actually some Coca Cola, for her new friend. I'm telling her all the time it's not healthy, but... You know, kids like kids. Right, kids like kids. All of us used to be kids. We haven't been introduced. Obrad. - I'm Radoje. Rasha. Police in Madrid has exposed a chain of pedophiles who exchanged photos and contacted children. This group of perverts consisted of many celebrities and members of Spain establishment. Did you hear that? That's what I'm talking about. Shocking! Really shocking. And how can you dare to let zour child on the streets... Talking to me? That's why I'm at home all day. You can never be too cautious having a kid these days. And the Goverment should do something as well. - Yes! School, too. - Yes, school as well. I expect Marina soon... - Yes... little Marina. And where is your wife? - Wife? My wife! We got divorced. Long time ago. But we stayed friends, because of the kid. And you? I bet you're living in a happy marriage. Not really. My job is demanding and I'm often out of home. That reflected our marriage. We got distant. And what do you do? I'm an inspector. An inspector? - Police inspector. Juvenille delinqency. Day and night, you know? I can imagine... Your pancakes are great! I've packed some for little Tamara. - Tanja! Yes, Tanja... My God, I don't know what happened to Marina. Hi, it's me. I'm fine, and you? Listen, did by any chance Marina stop by? She did? Yeah... No, it's fine. She'll sleep over? No, I don't mind. Just tell her she has to do her homework for tomorrow. Bye... You've heard it. Naughty little girl, she scared me... - Kids, you know? It's important that she's ok. Little Marina... Well, I have to go. - Ok. It's a shame that you haven't met Marina. Well, we'll have the chance. Now that we've met... Hi, neighbor! Can you fill this with water, please? What? - In March I'm going to Kilimanjaro, so... Son, the lady doctor called. And imagine, she's divorced, with kids. And I told her: My Obrad should have children of his own, not taking care of someone else's... Thanks a lot. Goodbye! So... There's no Marina? Right. There's no Marina, and of course, there's no wife. There's nothing. I'm pedophile. Disgusting, Oedipus pedophile. So, what shall we do now? Let's cut this torture. Tell me where to go, and what to bring... - How should I know? Well, you are the inspector. Yeah. And I'm also a pedophile. Dirty, old pedophile. May I get that drink now? And there's no... - Tanja? No. Just you and me. Dirty, old pedophiles. You're staring... - No. You are! - Ok, I'm staring. Here you go. - Thanks. Did you ever go to see a shrink? - Why should I? So that they can tell me that I'm a pedophile 'cause nobody loved me as a child, and I've lost my mom? I know that myself. Now you're staring. - What? Have you ever? - What? - You know... Basically, I haven't. With little girls? - No. I haven't. Wait a minute. Maybe you're a homo? - No... It's funny, these things with homosexuals. Only yesterday they were in hiding, completely illegal. And now, they are completely out and cool. What? You mean, maybe they'll legalize us too? Maybe in 30 years... If the media gave the right kind of coverage, and if the parliament... Radoje! GLUTTONY I thought we're going to the movies. Yeah, right! Like I want to throw money on that shit. What's wrong with this? It's all the same shit, movies, exhibitions, culture! Why are you dressed up like a prostitute? I thought we're going to the movies. - And that's cool? Come here. What? - Stand here. - What's with you, God! I'm just kidding, darlin' You'll be the best chick here! - You, silly... Am I ok? Ok. Let's go Dojcin Tutinac enough to said Dojcin, why virtual? Why onomatopoeia? Let's go to the movies, please! - We'll have yummiest food here and all for free. Samir told me they've been loading all day. Samir! - Really? - C'mon, my man! They'll eat the food! You dressed up for the occasion! See a guy from the Parliament! - You are a legend! You rule! See a guy from the Parliament! - You are a legend! You rule! He couldn't care less. He came to eat too. Samir, my bro! I can't recognize you! - Go, go! Did you take a crap this morning? Ha? - Go, go, go! Did you take a crap this morning? Ha? - Go, go, go! Well, how to put it... People eat. They have to. Would it be a problem if I farted? I just have to. It's simply one digestive sfumatto, of pulsing contures. It's simply one digestive sfumatto, of pulsing contures. Aesthetic escapism, 'cause of global consumerism. Monetary, even staged process. - Man! You're off to the market? Why are you pulling me? Why doesen't he buys a decent bag? This is culture!

This one is with spinach, and you got tuna and mayo. Mayo... I can't eat that. But this is special! - See you later, in a restaurant. Thanks. Let me rephrase this. What are we without culture? And what is culture without us? - Is he bullshiting? Like I love to say, we have to remember the simple man. Like I love to say, we have to remember the simple man.
