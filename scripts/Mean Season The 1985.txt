I THINK WE HAVE A CHANCE, LET ALONE THE OBLIGATION, TO DO A PIECE ON A SOCIOPATH WHO'S STILL OUT THERE. HE'S STILL A THREAT. , THAT'S--THAT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY ISN'T IT?

RECENTLY, THE SERIES OF BRUTAL MURDERS IN HIS CITY HAS SOMEWHAT CHANGED HIS OBJECTIVITY BECAUSE THE KILLER HAS CHOSEN TO USE HIM AS A LIAISON BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY, THE POLICE, AND HIMSELF. A SITUATION HAS DEVELOPED WHERE A REPORTER IS MATERIALLY INVOLVED IN THE STORY HE'S COVERING. HE'S WITH US AT WSVN, OUR NBC AFFILIATE IN MIAMI. MALCOLM, THANKS FOR BEING WITH US. MY PLEASURE, JOHN. TO BEGIN WITH, TELL US WHEN AND WHERE YOU RECEIVED THAT FIRST CALL. UH, IT WAS AT THE JOURNAL, AND IT WAS A FEW DAYS AFTER THEY FOUND THE FIRST BODY. HOW DID YOU REACT WHEN HE TOLD YOU WHO HE WAS? I DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM AT FIRST. IN MY YEARS OF REPORTING, I'VE HAD MY SHARE OF PECULIAR CALLS. [John] BUT HE CONVINCED YOU. HE HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE MURDER AND THE VICTIM THAT NOBODY ELSE COULD HAVE HAD. [John] HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU AND HE TALKED? [Malcolm] FIVE TIMES, JOHN. CAN WE ASSUME THA HE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN OF MUCH HELP TO THE POLICE? IT WOULDN'T BE HELPFUL FOR ME TO COMMEN ON THE PROGRESS OF THE INVESTIGATION RIGHT NOW. AFTER TALKING TO HIM AS OFTEN AS YOU HAVE, WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP THAT'S DEVELOPED? WELL, "RELATIONSHIP", JOHN, SUGGESTS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING IN I FOR BOTH PARTIES. I'M CERTAINLY DOING WHAT I CAN TO HELP, BUT THIS WASN'T MY IDEA. I MEAN, HE CALLED ME. [Gun cocking] [John] HAS HE SAID WHY HE CALLED YOU IN PARTICULAR? [Malcolm] HE SAID HE LIKED THE WAY I WRITE. ??[Eerie music] [Telephone rings] [Man] I SAW YOU ON TV THIS MORNING. I DIDN'T LIKE IT. WHY? YOU'RE BECOMING MORE IMPORTANT THAN ME. I'M DOING THE WORK, YOU GET PUT ON TV. YOU'RE GETTING TOO MUCH ATTENTION. I REALLY WISH I COULD COME FORWARD AND SPEAK FOR MYSELF, YOU KNOW. OF COURSE, I CAN'T. I'VE ONLY BEEN ARRESTED ONCE. WHAT YEAR? COME ON. I'M ALREADY BEING TOO GENEROUS ON PHONES THAT ARE TAPPED. MY PHONE ISN'T TAPPED. IS THERE ANY CHANCE WE'LL EVER MEET IN PERSON? SO YOU CAN BRING THE COPS AND BE A REAL HERO. YOU ANGER ME, YOU KNOW THAT? CUBAN COFFEE, PHIL? [Man on tape] I REALLY WISH I COULD COME FORWARD AND SPEAK FOR MYSELF. THIS IS INTERESTING. OF COURSE, I CAN'T. I'VE ONLY BEEN ARRESTED ONCE. [Malcolm on tape] WHAT YEAR? [Man on tape] COME ON. I'M ALREADY BEING TOO GENEROUS ON PHONES THAT ARE TAPPED. [Malcolm on tape] MY PHONE ISN'T TAPPED. IS THERE ANY CHANCE WE'LL EVER MEE IN PERSON? DUMB. [Man on tape] SO YOU CAN BRING THE COPS AND BE A REAL HERO. HIM, YOU ARREST DEAD. WELL, YOU GO TO CATCH HIM FIRST. , YOU GE A FEEL FOR HIM FIGURE OUT WHA HE'LL GO AFTER NEXT, AND THEN BLOW HIS DISEASED BRAINS OUT. I'M GOING TO GE SOME AMERICAN COFFEE. YOU KNOW, WE SEN A GUY TO MICHIGAN, AND THERE'S NO RECORD OF THE INDUSTRIAL ACCIDEN THAT HE DESCRIBED, NOT AT ANY OF THE MAJOR ASSEMBLY PLANTS. I GOT A 50 SAYS HE'S MAKING ALL THIS UP. YOU'RE NOT TAPPING MY PHONE, RIGHT, RAY? NO. GOOD NIGHT, RAY. YEAH. ??[Moody music] PERFECT. WIDE OPEN ??[Suspenseful music] WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! WAIT! WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! I--I--I-- POR FAVOR, I DELIVER FOR YOU THE PAPER. WHAT HAPPENED? . I'VE BEEN WITH THE COPS ALL NIGH I COME HOME, AND THE PLACE IS WIDE OPEN. IS I TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO REMEMBER TO LOCK THE GODDAMN DOOR? I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE GONE. I'M SORRY. I DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND THIS ANYMORE. I'M SORRY. I MEAN IT. I AM SORRY. DON'T BE. ??[Sad music] YOU'RE LIVING ALONE, AND I'M LIVING WITH SOMEBODY I DON'T EVEN KNOW. IT DOESN'T WORK. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I'M PUTTING A LO OF TIME IN THE STORY. IT'S GETTING ATTENTION, AND YOU FEEL LEFT ALONE. THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT, RIGHT? YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS. YOU CAN'T. YOU'RE NOT PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION. CHRIS, I KNOW I'VE BUSTED MY ASS FOR EIGHT YEARS. WHAT WE'VE WANTED IS RIGHT HERE. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? EVER SINCE YOU STARTED THE BODY COUNT, YOU LE EVERYTHING SLIDE. I'VE GOTTEN SO FAR AWAY THAT LEAVING'S JUST A FORMALITY, MALCOLM. HONEY, THIS IS THE LAST THING WE NEED RIGHT NOW. I SAID I WAS SORRY, O.K.? I HEARD. DO YOU WANT A DRAG? DRAG, YOUR ASS. YOU GOT TO BE CLOSER THAN YOU'RE SAYING. SURE WOULD LIKE EVERYONE TO THINK SO. YOU GOT A VOICE PRINT. GOT HIS M.O. YOU KNOW HE'S DUPLICATING. YOU KNOW WHAT PAR OF THE COUNTRY HE'S FROM.

I WAS WORKING AT A STATE-FUNDED HALFWAY HOUSE AT THE TIME FOR DOPERS, ALCOHOLICS, MENTAL HOSPITAL DISCHARGEES. SOME CHARACTER STUMBLES INTO MY OFFICE. HE SAYS HE'S THE GUY THAT KILLED THOSE FIVE PEOPLE IN CHICAGO. HE SAYS HE WENT TO THE COPS AND TURNED HIMSELF IN, BUT THEY CHASED HIM OU BECAUSE SOME PSYCHIATRIS DECIDED THAT HE WAS SOMEBODY THAT GOT OFF MAKING CONFESSIONS, AND, UH, HE NEEDED THE HEADLINES. IS THA WHAT YOU THOUGHT? WELL, I WENT DOWN TO THE PRECINCT WITH HIM AND LISTENED TO HIS STORY, AND IT SOUNDED STRAIGHT TO ME. IT TURNED OUT, THOUGH, THAT HE DID HAVE A HISTORY OF FALSE CONFESSIONS. [O'Shaughnessy chuckles] HE WAS PISSED, THOUGH. I MEAN, HE WAS PISSED. HE FIGURED HE FINALLY DID SOMETHING, THEN SOMEBODY ELSE GOT THE CREDIT. WELL, AFTER THE VISI TO THE POLICE, HE KEPT COMING AROUND? NO. HE, UH... HE CALLS ONE MORE TIME AFTER THINGS QUIET DOWN, AND HE WANTS TO THANK ME FOR BEING SO UNSELFISH. AND THEN HE, UH-- HE SAID IF I TRIED TO GET ANY ATTENTION FROM WHAT HE'D DONE, HE'D HAVE ME KILLED. YOU GOT A NAME ON THIS GUY? UH, YEAH. ALAN DELOUR.
