I really can't speak to you at the moment. No, I'm at the TV station. What actor? No, I wrote the script myself. Bye. Hi. Take a seat. When will we film the movie? That's a mighty story, alright. Tell me, though, is it all true? True? The truth is much uglier. When did you meet them? About 3 days before the war. Moscow. Press Bureau. Aug. 6, 2008. - So you want to go to South Ossetia? Well, yeah: you get your coverage and I'll get my term paper. LA, US State Department. Aug. 6, 2008. South Ossetia? I think that's in Georgia. Yeah, you'll need to get a Georgian visa and then fly to Tbilisi. To I go their through Tbilisi? If they find out you're a journalist you won't get your visa. Fly to Vladikavkaz instead and then to Tskhinvali. - I don't have a travel passport. - Take your state ID, it should suffice. US citizens travelling to that region are advised to get 12 vaccines. Where should I get them? Some in the shoulder, some... lower. - Shit, I can't stand injections. - And what about dysentery? And the vaccines? What vaccines? Just don't go drinking from rain pools. Ok, and what kind of currency do they have there? I suppose euro. They all have euro over there. I think even in Ukraine. Georgia... no, it says here they have something called 'lari'. They have lari there, don't they? What lari? Who needs them? Take rubles with you and you'll be all set. What are you going there for? 'Olympius Inferno'. You speak Georgian? It's Latin. It's the name of the butterfly I intend to catch. Excuse me, you want to catch what there? I'm an entomologist. I have a university grant to collect butterflies and shoot a documentary about them. Are your parents aware of where you're going? Do I need to get their written permission? I'm just asking. You're old enough to do weird stuff on your own. Are you going alone? No, with a childhood friend. You know, the men in Caucasus - they're... I travelled there at the times of the USSR. Would I want to make you a company... No, thanks, I'll be fine on my own. You'll get your documents at our office in Vladikavkaz. - Well, have a nice trip. - Thank you. Here are the lists of addresses. Should you need any assistance call our embassy, they'll help you out. Have a great trip. Thanks a lot. OLYMPIUS INFERNO [Unofficial translation by Alex S.] Say 'cheese', guys. One-two... Okey, thanks. Can I take a picture of you, please? Great. He looks like a normal guy, what does he need butterflies for? Does he speak Russian at all? He did, when I spoke to him on the phone. He moved when we were in 8th grade. Mishka! How long do we have to wait for you? Hi. Zhenka... You didn't expect me to grow into a woman? You know what? No, I didn't: I though you're a six-foot african American. Shall we kiss? - Hi. - Hi. This is Viktor Andreyich, peackeepers colonel. Hello, Michael. - Nice to meet you. Ahsar here will be our guide. Nice to meet you. I spoke on the phone with your main office, and they told me you're the best specialist. - No need for formalities. Let me help you. - Thank you. Do you still have war here? Yes, in the morning they've repelled a tank division, but we expect them to attack again in the evening. Aren't you aware of it? Our State Dept. didn't warn me. The war ceased over 15 years ago. A war with whom? With the Georgians. And here they come. Hi, everyone! The wine's on me. - Thank you, Vaho. Nowadays everyone lives peacefully here and we help to keep it that way. How do you expect to be friends with them? They don't like to work, drink wine in the morning. And you don't? - Going over to Ahsar's national park? - Yep. I can take you wherever you want. No, thanks. I'll be your guide for a modest fee. Thanks. Planning to do some filming? A scientific research. Well, I won't go taking his bread. Well, we're not saying farewell yet. You still haven't told me about your wife. It'll take some three days next time we meet. Are you certain there won't be any shooting here? Don't worry. They won't shoot you, that's certain. - Thank you, goodbye. - Bye. Maybe we should've hired that other guy. He would've carried the equipment. Would it cost a lot? - Mikey. - Half of your belongings. He says he's here to earn money: his family's in Georgia. He sells everything, he'd even sell his own mother. All Georgians are normal, but this one's kind of strange. I caught him a couple of times in the national park. He doesn't look like a poacher. Who knows what he's been searching for? Do you have normal roads over here? What? Hi, how's your wife and children? Fine, and yours? Everything's perfect. Madam. How's the wine? Fantastic wine. Pour in some more. Michael. - No-no. C'mon, the car will stop working. Let's go. Enjoy your stay. Say hi to your wife. Who was that? A relative of yours? No idea, I saw him for the first time. Hello. - My wife, Saira. Michael, Zhenya. - Nice to meet you. Bad sign: the Georgians are leaving. Perhaps, they're leaving for a weekend. With the belongings? I'm afraid they might start bombardments again. Where are they going? What did she say? She says it's a tradition for entire Georgian families to visit the weddings. I'm fine. - Are you ok? Sorry, dear, it's the kids. They're off to see granddad and we're still stumbling on their stuff. How many kids to you have? - Three. We have a tradition: three pies should be on the table to symbolize sun, water and earth. To the Almighty! Let St. George keep us safe. To our meeting and your visit. You don't like araka? Ahsar, we need to get to the park. Let's go. Finish your drink and we'll go. Let's go! - Quite, they're showing Saakashvili. Who is it? - You don't know? It's the king of Spain. No way. - It's Georgian president. ...and the Russian party will monitor the status of Ossetian autonomy. Thank God. No more war. Do you trust him? Whe else can we trust? Our children are taught to hide in the basement when they hear loud banging. Let's drink to peace, to kids growing up without war. A marvelous toast! To peaceful skies above our heads. We should be going to the park. You're such a pain in the neck. C'mon, let's go. ...less than a day remaining before the openning ceremony for the Olympics, but new records have already been set: these Olympics are the most expensive... Hey, Jess, honey. No, I'm fine, my voice is ok. I'm not ill. Listen... maybe, I thought, you know... maybe we should announce our engagement as soon as I come back. We'll throw a barbecue party, we'll call all the friends. No formal suits or restaurants. And please, let's not ask mom. Think about it. No... I just can't right now. I'll call you later. Yeah, of course I love you. I miss you too, bye. So, let's ride, groom? Let's ride. Why there're always fighting going on in the Caucasus? You just can't be waging war here. Mishka. I know now why your olymplus-plimplus inhabits these places. An ideal place. Why did you bring all that junk with you? What are you going to do to this poor butterfly? We'll cut its feet and dry it in the oven. Is that so, Mike? No, Zhenya. I'll collect them and make a documentary. You'll be climbing mountains like a mountain goat? It's much simpler than that. Come. It's very hard to film night butterflies. Olympius inferno flies with speed of up to 50 km/h. We'll set up the cameras in places of their likely appearance, it'll be triggered by movement which will bring picture in focus. Can you please hold it for me? The image is transferred to the receiver and saved on a hard drive. Over here. And then it comes up on the screen. So that we can see what's being shot. Marvelous. The hard disk can store hundreds of hours of footage. Thank you. That's it. Now we just need to set up the cameras. Can't we do it in the morning? A normal man doesn't work in the evenings. I even brough araka with me. What araka? A true scientist can't miss an entire night. Yes, he can't. When we filmed in Africa twenty hours a day no one whined. Ah, Ahsar. The equipment - it's very expensive, so you'll be watching it, while we set up the cameras. Watching? There's no one here. I don't even lock the doors. - For a separate fee, obviously. - Nevermind, go on. Thank you. Why did you become an entomologist? It's a prestigious occupation in the US. Even Nabokov was interested in entomology. Well, if Nabokov himself... Why not a doctor, as your dad? I tried studying, but didn't feel anything for it. Did you fall unconscious during your first autopsy? Yep. Landed with my head right inside the intestines. No way. Yuck. The head got stuck, they pulled me by my feet. They called the cops and firemen. And then? Then? That's it! I've been like that ever since. It was a minor joke, Zhenya. - Can I laugh now? Yep. Thanks. Blissus leucopterus! What's that? An aspirator. It works like a vacuum cleaner. Michael, what's wrong? Michael! - Call 911. - What 911?! Breathe! I won't do a mouth-to-mouth breathing. Spit it out! I swallowed it. What was it? A chinch bug ...of the lygaeidae family. Have you ever used this piece of junk before? A thousand times. You haven't even peeled off a price tag. There was a ladder. Imagine your butt sticking out of the rocks and a butterfly is sitting on top of it. Yes, yes, ok? You know, it's my first time catching insects, and we visited Africa with Jessica as tourists. I can't do a single thing! Is this what you wanted to hear? Is it? Why the hell did you come with me in the first place? It's your dad who called up my mom asking to find someone to keep an eye on his boyscout, who all of a sudden rushed to Ossetia. - Don't even continue. But frankly, I just wanted to see the guy whom I had a crush on in high school. Yeah, and he was blind and didn't pay attention to how I followed him. Then he left for America, and I was writing letters for three years and never received a single answer. I didn't receive any letters. We moved frequently. And Jessica has been my girlfriend since high school. We'll soon be engaged. Well, I also have a very cool boyfriend you can only dream of. I don't dream of men. Let's go on, boyscout. So you plan to leave your cameras throughout entire Ossetia? I didn't invite you here. Let's sort it out once and for all who's helping whom. Where did you get them from? Our counter-intelligence officer told us to look for them. We found them approximately a mile away from here. The guy has an American passport. And the girl carried no ID on her. Untie and send them some place far from here. Let the embassy sort it out. The counter-intelligence is here. Where did the Americans come from? They're not Americans, they're Russians with American passports. And the girl's definitely from Moscow. I was certain they'll be around here somewhere. What the fuck are they doing here? We'll take care of it, colonel. Please remind all military personnel that filming and calling home is prohibited. I will, captain. What equipment did you bring with you? -Entomologic. There's an aspirator, containers. We came to film butterflies. Olympius inferno. Give me back my phone, I need to call an embassy. How many video cameras do you have? Just one, it's in the village and we also have a photo camera. We went looking for butterflies. Please, let us go. Do you belive in this butterflies bullshit yourselves? Put them in the car. Excuse me. Captain Addams. I was told that you detained an American citizen. False information, captain. They're Russians. -No, we're Americans. -This man is under protection of the American flag. - The passport is a fake. Mind your own business. - He's an American! Control, captain Adams. Michael Oria is in Georgian custody. He has a visa effective as of yesterday. [In Georgian] If you wouldn't be an American, you bastard, I'd... I had a chance to learn your language, captain. Thank you. Our headquarters confirm that US citizen Michael Oria is indeed present in Georgia. He has to be evacuated and delivered to the embassy. They have to let her go as well. I don't care about citizens of other states. - She's my fiance! - I repeat... - I'm telling you she'll get her citizenship after our wedding. We have all the papers ready for it. I'm not leaving without her. Do you want me to stay here? Release the girl. And have him return the camera. This is property of an American university. What the hell is going on here? - It's an operation to restore constitutional order in the country. - It's war! Yes, honey, it's war. Listen, Zhenya, we need to Tbilisi as soon as possible. We have to leave as soon as possible. So that they find out there that I'm not your fiance there? Zhenya! Zhenya! Stupid woman! Zhenya, where are you going? Run faster, we have to find Ahsar. He's not here. Michael, look what's going on. It's her... ...olympius inferno. - It's a miracle. - Wake up from your trance. Do you understand that this will be making tomorrow's headlines? One could only dream of it. We have to take it with us. Do you think you'll get far with it? Zhenya, it's university's property. I can go to jail, if I lose it! Then go ahead and guard it. C'mon, leave it. Zhenya! Zhenya, I need to hide it all. C'mon, answer me! Ahsar? Ahsar, are you alive? We're in the park. Ashar, they stared a war! Yep, got it. He's waiting for us at home. He'll take us to the peacekeepers. Get down! - What are you doing? - Where are they? Go! - Ahsar! - Saira! Speak! Vaho, don't you recognize me?! He just shot a man. - Stay down! We have to call the cops. He has to be arrested. C'mon, we've got to run away. Whom are you calling? - An embassy, they'll save us. He's looking for us, don't you understand? He'll do the same to us! Let's go! Only our troops will help us! Don't look back! ...killing Ossetian civilians: women, children, old men - and most of them are Russian citizens. In line with Constitution and Federal laws I have to protect their lives as a president of Russian Federation. No matter where they're located. We will not leave unpunished the killing of our people. Where are we going? We're going in the wrong direction. We're going in the right direction. How do you know? Do we have a choice? We're lost, aren't we? We're lost! I told you we had to contact the embassy. Stop whining and call your embassy. Have them send a warship for you. There's no signal here. Buy yourself a better phone. Who are you? We're... Russians. It's the Russians. Where are you going? To our troops, to peacekeepers. That's in the opposite direction. Come. Stupid. Where are you going? I'm going to Tskhinvali, to fight. Keep quiet! We're headed for the city, to our relatives. Gabo, you're the only son I have left. Yesterday his father was killed right in our backyard by the tanks. Me and Gabo wanted to bury him, but the neighbors told us that his body was boobytrapped. - What do you mean? They set a grenade under the body, and when the relatives come to pick the body up, they get blown up. We didn't manage to bury him. Eat, dear. Take some more bread and cheese. Go down this road, but make sure you're not seen from the road itself. Okey? I'll walk you and then I'll be going to Tskhinvali. It's along the way. Come on. Hello? Hi, Andrey. Me? Everything's fine. The weather's beautiful. No, don't contact your friends at the military. No, they don't sell tickets to Ossetia. - Is it a Kalashnikov? - Baby, really, I'm fine. Yeah, I'll call you myself. My battery's dying and I don't have a charger. - Bye! - It's a safety lock. That's a single-shot mode and that's a burst mode. And that's a bolt. - Can I hold it? - Sure. - Are there any bullets in it? - Nope. Ok, we've gotta go. Let's go. Hello? Who did you get this number from? From mom? Andrey, please don't call me every five minutes. No, there's no war here. We're having a barbecue party. Love ya, bye! Why don't you want to talk to him? - I have nothing to say. - Nothing? What do you want me to tell him? That we're in deep shit? That I have no clue where we're at? That's some nazi's killing people in front of me and I'm being followed by a frigging Yank. And then they'll take my mom to the hospital with a heart attack. He'll fly over here and get killed. - Quiet! It's our troops. There are journalists over there. - Zhenya, they'll take us to the peacekeepers. - They'll take you alright, but no me. No worries, I'll walk by myself. - Thanks a lot. - No, thank you. If it wasn't for you my mom would never let me go. - Bye! - Zhen, come on, they'll leave without us. What you can see behind me are the consequences of mass air bombing. We're in one of the Georgian villages destroyed by Russian air attack. This night illegal military forces of South Ossetia aided by the Russians attacked Georgia. Independent Georgia has to defend itself. Francis Avatow, SBC. Hello, I'm sorry, I'm an American. Great. - We were caught in the fire with my fiance. We need your help. - So, you're Yank. - I wanted to tell you: it's not Georgia that was attacked. - Look, we can take you away, if you want. You just said it's Georgia and it's not. We're going to Tskhinvali. We can drop you off on our way. You said it's Georgia, but we're in South Ossetia. Look, I don't want to discuss that. Everything I said will be on the air within half an hour. I can prove that it was Georgia, who launched the attack. Well, that seems interesting. I can't offer you a price without seeing it first. Okey. Do you still doubt? Now to the terms. You'll start with an interview with me. Second, when using this footage you'll credit me. And third, a financial settlement. Take the disk. Hey, what are you doing?! Put your hands on the car. Honey, tanks and aircraft are bullshit. The main thing in journalism... Have you ever heard of a media war? Now everybody thinks that Georgia was attacked. I forgot to write down your phone number. I plan to visit Moscow after the war, go studying. Will you show me around? No problem. - Get in the car! - And give us back the disk. Michael, say 'cheese'. C'mon, you can do better. That's a smile of a retard. Gabo! Stop laughing and look in the camera. Take off your helmet. Tell me, why are they doing it? It's a new type of warfare. It's won by the one who shouts the most. Remember Iraq: your people were insisting there are chemical weapons there. And after the war they've discovered it's not there. Oops, sorry. People devour whatever they're told on the TV. We too believed Saakashvili when he told us there'll be peace. It's information warfare at its best. There was a case, when one western journalist borrowed footage of the Afghanistan war in which a body is dragged behind a Russian-built tank. Then he declared that it's proof of Russian atrocities in Chechnya. Thank goodness, the truth was discovered later on and a scandal followed. Why do you want to become a journalist? I want to reveal the truth using your hard disk. It's not our troops. Don't stop - we're journalists. - Where are you taking them? - To Tskhinvali. We're already late. They intend to film some general there. Pull your car over there. I told you to pull the car over. I have an order not to let journalists in. There's still fighting going on. You'll have to wait about four hours. These bastards haven't conquered Tskhinvali yet. They hope to be done within four hours. Dammit, I need to get there. Where are our peacekeepers? You want me to ask the Georgians? To tell them we're looking for friends? Excuse me, can I take few pictures? Take away their camera and lock them inside. What do they want from us? We have to get to Tskhinvali asap. It's the main foothold of the peacekeepers. There's fighting there, haven't you heard him? Do you want no one to know about this? I don't want to die. Don't worry. I'll take look after you just as I promised your dad. You said the peacekeepers will help us. Yet they couldn't help themselves. - Civilized people don't shoot peacekeepers. It's not my war. Well, I'm going. Where are you going? I'll tell them I have to get to the city. I'll leave the car behind and try to get to Tbilisi some way or another. And you do whatever you want. I thought you'll grow into second Nabokov. And you've grown into a crybaby full of butterflies. Ok. So what do you propose? We'll take the disk to the TV and tell the truth. - Tell me. - It's gonna be a bomb. The girl, she's got real shots of the beginning of the operation. She's gonna go down in the history of journalism. Why does it make you so happy? I'm talking as a professional. If the Russians air it no one will believe our story anymore. - What do they look like? A tall, American guy, and a Russian girl, and then, there's a local boy. Look, they've got the jeep. It's got an SBC logo on it. - Get this loser to the front lines. - My uncle's a major. I don't give a fuck about your uncle. - What's going on? - Our cover has been blown. Zhen, wait up. Stop. Listen, let's throw that disk away. And then we'll hide until it's all over. - No. - How many more people have to die? Like that kid. - He was saving us. He wanted us to tell the truth. - Is this what you'll tell his mom? Who's next in line? Me? Or you? They're hunting us. - Do as you wish, boyscout. I'll walk alone. I owe Gabo too much. Hello? Jessica, baby, I miss you too. You heard what? But it's not true. No, Georgia started it. What? Listen, no, I'm fine they're taking me to an embassy, and then - to an airport. Yes, of course my car's bulletproof. No, baby, I'm perfectly fine. I'll talk to you later. I love you. Bye! She says our TV stations claim it was you who attacked Georgia. What did you expect? We have freedom of press and they can say whatever they want. They were cheated. - By whom? I don't know. I guess by Georgia. Do you believe it? Where are we going? I'm going to Tskhinvali. To peacekeepers' headquarters. And what if there're no more headquarters there? You should've told us earlier, captain. They're likely in Tskhinvali by now. I don't see them yet. You have an hour. Capture them alive and search them well. They're shooting - it's a good sign, it means they haven't captured the city yet. - Do you know the way? - Roughly. - Where are we now? Probably in the southern outskirts. We have to ask the locals where's the peacekeepers' base. - Look for an ATM, we'll need money. Take off your helmet. - What?! Take off your helmet! - Why? ..and the vest as well. Because it's a NATO uniform. Taxi! Let's go. Freeze! Lay down! Wait for me. Over there! There's a shelter. My baby! My little boy! Help me! Don't scream! Help me! - He's wounded. Help me! - Mike, what are you waiting for? Help me! C'mon, pick him up! Is there a doctor here? - No, no doctors here. My little boy's dying! Please help! You studied for a doctor, your father's a doctor. I have a hemophobia. - You what? I fall unconscious when I see blood. Look at his wound. - Zhenya, don't make me do it! I can't. - I told you to look at him! Mike! Michael, wake up! Michael! We have to get a fragment out. We need medicine, tools, we need bandages, injections, antibiotics. Do you hear me? We need tools and drugs. Michael! - We've got fifteen minutes. Then it'll be too late. - Where do I take it? Is there a pharmacy nearby? - It was two blocks away, but it got bombarded. - There's an ambulance parked outside. We need antibiotics. Where's your fucking pharmacy? It's around the corner, but it's totally ruined. Give the boy some water. Someone! Help! Please, hurry up! Why can't you hurry up?! - Keep quiet! My little boy... Make me an injection. - Can't you do it by yourself? No, I can't. The injection will help keep me conscious. In the arm... It was the most painful shot in my life. If I lose consciousness, don't slap me, use ammonia instead. I need a knife. - Here, take mine. Fire. - Take the candle. Hurry up, will you! Move your hands away and hold his head. Thanks, but don't shove it in my mouth. - Sorry. Hold his head. Hand me the pincers. Hold his wound. Raise his head. Hold the bandage. Tie it up! The sleeve. He'll live. - Thank you very much! I'll be praying for you for the rest of my life. Vaho, you've let me down. We'll get help for as long as we play the victim. If they get away, be a man and blow your brains out. Wait, I'll be there shortly. - Can we open the road from the city? A humanitarian cordon? - What for? They'll think in the west that we let the civilians leave. - That should not concern you. - But they'll also try to use it to escape and reach the Russians together with other refugees. There's only one way out of the city. Think about it. - I'll get in touch with the general. It's an all-out genocide of the Ossetian people. We don't know anything about our relatives. The communication lines are cut off. It's outside of any norms of a civilized society. We saw it ourselves: an old lady was fleeing with two little children, and the tank ran them over. We've reached an agreement that from 3 pm to 6 pm we'll declare one-side truce on the part of the Georgian troops. What did he say? He's saying the civilians can leave. - Do you believe him? What if it's true? We have to risk it. - How will you know? He's still bleeding. There's nothing more I can do here. We need to get him to the hospital. - Someone has to go and then let everyone else know. - How will you go? On my back? - You have a car. - I can bring the wheels, if you care: the bastards shot my garage. - There's an ambulance car, if it's still in one piece. - Then we have to go. I'll go with you. - Take the bag. Hurry up. It's got manual transmission. - Do you know how to drive? I drove in school. Drive yourself. There's a clutch pedal. Now press the breaks. Start the engine! Go! - Release the clutch slowly. Now drive! Your Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, made a statement condemning Russian aggression towards Georgia. Great Britain's prime minister has released statements criticizing Russian aggression. - Soon you'll see. Many countries of the world rally for isolating Russia. US warships are moving towards Georgia's shores. Let's hope it won't start World War III. Why don't they mind their own business? All of my neighbors were Georgians. We've always celebrated together. Hold still, my dear. I think he wants to drink. Do you have water? No, don't let him drink. Have patience, we'll arrive soon. How much longer do we have to drive? We're half way there. We have to call our relatives and let them know they can leave the city. We'll drop the boy off and return to pick them up. They're here to get us. Freeze! Mind showing me the butterflies? Where's the disk? We lost it in Tskhinvali during a bombardment. Bring the old man. We've got a lot of bullets. Listen, we don't have any disk, let him go. Don't do it! Is this what you're looking for? Please let us go. We have an injured little boy with us in the car. I'll let you go, if this is what I'm looking for. You're free to leave. - Where are you taking him? - She'll come with me. The Russian girl will go home with the refugees. And as for you, US citizen, will come to Tbilisi. - She's my fiance! Then you can write her an SMS telling you arrived home safely. I want to say goodbye to her! There's a backup copy in the notebook. We'll pick it up, when it's all over. We have to make it look natural, as if I was leaving my fiance behind. I think that's natural enough. I doesn't mean a thing, got it? I know. Fighting for the whole day, no time to even take a piss. Captain, sir, I've done as you ordered. They have a copy. Your parents are in the US, aren't they? Please... Please, don't mess with them. I won't be able to save you for the second time. How's the life over there? Not so bad. You should've left and gone back home. Your fiance... - Wait. Please, calm down. Your girl's injured, but we can still save her. I'll help you. She's still breathing, we can still save her. Pick her up. Lost your way, gamardzhoba? I'm Russian, I'm Russian! I have a wounded girl in the car. Where's a nearest hospital? Drive further down the road, turn left, then straight ahead for about 40 kilometers. Go, go! Hej, buddy, lend me a phone to send an SMS that I'm alive. Guys, I found a long lost buddy. Here. Hello? Who is it? Andrey who? Andrey, she's wounded lightly. I'm telling you she's wounded! Where are you? Where are you at? Hello? Hello?! Ok, viewers, joining us here in the studio is Michael, an entomologist and a witness to recent events in South Ossetia. Together with Michael is his fiance, who was probably worried sick while he was away. - Yeah, but, all that is behind us now, so finally we can get married. - I bet, fantastic! Michael, maybe you can tell us a little bit about the Russian attack on Georgia. - It was the other way around. Maybe you didn't understand the question. - No, I have proof. I have several hours of footage showing the attack of Georgian troops on Ossetia. Ok, wonderful, why don't we take a look at that shocking footage Michael has provided us with. Wow, congratulations, Michael! I'm sure this footage will be of great interest to National Geographic channel. Our decision is final and we're totally serious about this issue: we've recognized two new sovereign states in line with international laws.
