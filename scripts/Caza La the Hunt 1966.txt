A day in the country and a little exercise will do us good. - What a day, Jos! - Good day for rabbit hunting. Easy, Cuca! My pretty one. Easy. Give me a hand here. - Listen, what do we do with this? - Leave it, no one will touch it. You don't mind that I brought my brother-in-law, do you? He's always pestering me about hunting. If it wasn't for him, we'd have no Jeep. He borrowed it from his father-in-law. Not at all. On the contrary. It's just that... who'd have guessed? Together again after so much time. With Arturo we'd be the same old four. Poor Arturo... Don't know about you, but I keep thinking of him. Yes... that was a tragedy. Jos, when was the last time we saw each other? I don't know. Your wedding! - Eight years, then. - Eight years already? - Quique, did you bring the radio? - Yes. - What will you have? - Another cognac. How about you, Paco? - Tea with lemon for me. - Coffee and milk. I can't drink cognac, especially at this time of day. - Bring me a gin. - With Coke or some other crap. Cognac gets to my head. By the third glass, I'm ready to sleep. - Gin, on the other hand... - That's the strontium, the radiations. We were brought up with cognac. Isn't that right, Paco? - What? - That we were brought up with cognac. You most of all. - How's your life, Luis? - Nothing special. A bit older... and with Jose, as always. And how is Luca? Didn't you know? Can you think of anyone else who can stand Luis other than me? - Who is the tea for? - For me. Cognac. I didn't know, I'm sorry. No need to apologize, it's all in the past. Do you have a family? A boy. Look! What do you think, of my cousin, sir? Don't sir me, I'm not that old. Good looking boy. Are you ill? As usual, it's my stomach. It's starting to bother me. He looks just like your wife. Let's go! Let's make the best of the day. I'm going to have another cognac, if you don't mind. Have 1,000 for all I care. Or stay here and we'll get you on the way back. - What do I owe you? - 58 pesetas. Don't mind him. Whenever he wakes up early he gets like this. He's changed since he hooked up with that woman. - No imagination. - Hooked up with whom? Don't you know? Remember Maribel? Maribel? With Maribel? Jose is something else! - What about Ana and the kids? - He's asked for a separation. I myself advised him to do it, for the good of both of them. It's always the same. In the beginning, all's fine... then the man goes one way, and the woman another way... until the moment when it goes crack. The same old story... we're never happy with what we have. But... Maribel is not right for Jose. We'll see. Quiet, Cuca! Strange. It's nice here. We'll have a fantastic day. - Where will we hunt? - You're already dying to shoot! Juan. Juan! How strange! Where's he gone? I'll be up soon, darling. Did you bring the milk for the animals? I'm looking for Juan the keeper. Do you know where he is? They spend the day sleeping and stirring nervously. If you see him, tell him we're down at the river, by the caves. That he should come down as soon as he gets here. - Who are you? - Don Jos. Have you seen my granddaughter? She has to bring milk for the critters. They're going crazy, and one of them will escape. Where's your granddaughter? I'll go with you, and we'll take the critters. What... you? No. Just stay in bed. If you see your son just tell him we're here and to come and get us. Easy! Easy... does it. Come here. Don't get nervous. Listen! You must know where Juan is. Yes, sir. He's with the lambs, but he'll be back soon. As soon as gets here, tell him to go down and look for us. The old lady inside said something about milk for the ferrets. Don't mind her. She's always going about the same thing, all day long. Let's get everything prepared. We can hunt with the ferrets in the afternoon. - Go, donkey! - What are you doing? - Come on... - You! Stop fooling around. Break your neck, that's all we need! I'll fall, keep still! Jose! I'm going to fall, Jose. I don't trust this critter! Come, Jose! You're younger than me and already wasted. We'll see how that wound heals... You've got water rather than blood. Don't kid yourself. If I'd come down by myself, this wouldn't have happened. - Did you bring the first aid kit? - Don't know... it's below the... You're off to a bad start. What got into you? What a way to drive! Incredible! Paco knows a lot about driving. Have you told your brother in law that you used to be a truck driver? A truck driver? When was that? A long time ago. - Did you bring the kit? - Look under the seat. I think I left it there. Do you like the place? Were you in the war? A lot of people died here. A whole lot. And now it's just the holes. It's a good place to kill. - You knew this place, didn't you Paco? - Long time ago, I didn't remember it. That time we were further down. Let's get the stuff out. All right. Are there really rabbits here? Look, see those holes? They're burrows. If you had asked Juan... he'd have said that those are warrens... something like a rabbit city. Jose, are you sure you brought the first aid kit? Are you still in the car? Come down and help us unpack. And how do I heal my finger? How should I know? Let's hope nothing got broken. With that driving style of yours... Did you see this? Don't worry, it doesn't matter. Come on down already, Luis! You don't want to stay there all day. - Whose is this? - Mine. To a good hunter, rabbit hunting is meaningless. A harmless critter that's just trying to hide. There's no room for the weak in life. No room for the weak or the idiots. It's the law of nature. - You don't mean that. - Luis is right about the hunting... The rabbit gets few chances to defend itself. The more an enemy can defend himself, the nicer the hunt is. It's a power to power struggle. That's why someone said that man-hunt is the best hunt. What are you saying? Hunting is like everything else, the big fish eats the little fish. That depends, sometimes the opposite happens. Consider the piranhas. - What are those? - Tell him. He knows about such stuff. He's been reading paperbacks about Martians. Piranhas are a type of carnivorous fish in the Amazon. When they smell blood, they attack in mass and can devour an ox or a person... in a jiffy. Just the bones are left. With women like these, it's easy to understand Luis' piranhas story. I'd let them eat me any time, Jose! I prefer flesh and blood women. Wow! You could have warned us, Luis. Good shot! Where did you learn to shoot like that? - Why don't you monkey around some more? - Watch out, it's hot. - Nice gun! - Are you really going to use that gun? And he'll kill more than us. Don't know where he finds the pulse. Someone's coming. It's Juan. About time. The best time is about to end. Your shotgun, Quique. And be careful, let's not spoil the day. You too? A Luger. "Made in Germany". A quality gun. - Where did you get it? - It belongs to my father. When they freeze, there's no way to make them shoot. Many a man died because of that. Are we ready? Luis! What are you doing? I'm ready. I'm not going to be carrying stuff. Where are you going with that? You'll ruin it. It's just to have a memento. Carcasses are the best mementos. Leave that. Come on! Let's get a move on. Good morning. I heard shots and thought it was you. - How are you, Don Jos? - Where were you? With the lambs. I work alone now. As you know, my brother left for Germany. - I noticed you have ferrets. - Yes, sir. Here's the thing. We'll go out to see if there's anything out there... Watch out for traps. They're marked in white. Don't go too far and keep an eye on our things. And be here around one thirty to fix us a "paella". Yes, sir. And where is your dog? The one-eyed one? He died this winter. - I have another one now for the flock. - Pity. We're wasting time, Jose. This is the best time. With that plague, are there any rabbits? I've seen some. I trapped one last week. Just our luck. I can't stand cripples, they give me the creeps. - Still obsessed? - But, why? That's just foolish. I'd rather die than lose an arm or a leg. Besides, they're bad luck. Juan is hard to understand. But living here in the bush with the cold winter... and the hot summer... Like now. What annoys me is that he sets rabbit traps... and then says they're disappearing due to myxomatosis. Anyhow, I can forgive Juan. He spends all year here in the bush... It's not so bad... all year long without anybody bothering you. I'd change places with him. It's all the same to you. You'd change places with anyone. "I've got this feeling of having been here before. "I like it... the heat, the smell of thyme. "What a strange feeling! "When have I been in a place like this?" - Cuca! - What's up with Cuca? She must have seen something. Out, Cuca, out! A sick rabbit. We're done for. And it's recent. Never seen them like that? C'mon, Cuca! It's all ready, uncle. Don't touch that stuff, Carmen! I'm not touching, just looking. Did you see the nice radio? That Don Jos, the oldest one, doe he own it all? If only he'd think of improving the land instead of hunting. The soil is good, we could have a decent harvest. But what does he care? - Did you know that myxomatosis was spread by a French doctor? - What for? Well, rabbits really know how to multiply. Now it's called multiplication. Somebody had the idea of taking rabbits to Australia... and the rabbits didn't find any natural enemies there. They figure that a pair of rabbits had Don't you know that in Australia some parts of the bush seems to move... - from so many rabbits? - I tell you, rats and rabbits... They say that a doctor, what was his name...? Devel or Dein. He infected one rabbit with myxomatosis and let it loose. The disease soon crossed the Pyrenees... - and that's how we got here. - You know a lot about rabbits. - Too much. - And about other things, Paco. "It didn't look like a rabbit. It didn't even look like an animal. "It was like a monster... Will the rabbits we hunt be in that state? Cuca! Cuca! Come here. Easy, easy Cuca. Almost caught it, right? You almost did. The first one you hunt is all for you. My pretty one! Load it and get ahead of me. I'll show you. We start here. Paco and I on the right and you cover the other flank. Let Enrique cover a wing, it's less dangerous. - Do you mind? - I don't care, as you wish. OK then. Paco and I will go on ahead... then Enrique to the right and you close the flank on the right. Listen, this isn't a military operation. - I just want to shoot once and for all. - Make sure you don't shoot us... "If I could just convince Paco. "He likes to hunt. He's a hunter. "This damned sun is making me nervous. "If I could convince Paco, everything might still be fixed. "Can't get distracted. Forget everything now. "That trap could have broken my ankle. "That's all I would need." "Why does he close the traps? That Juan must live on rabbits. "Sick rabbits, that's why he limps. "Unbearable heat. What got into me? Accepting Jose's hunting invitation. "What an idiot I am. He's invited me just to ask for money, I'm sure. "What else?" Can I have a drink? - What's this? - Go back to your place. There she goes, Jose! Damn! Take it, it's yours. Don't know where I hit it. Rifle bullets are very small. What are you doing? Look, like that. Cuca! Cuca! Fetch! Cuca! Fetch! Cuca! Fetch! Come on, Cuca. Fetch! Cuca! Fetch over there! Come on, Cuca. Fetch there again. "I wonder what Luca is doing. She's with anybody, forget her. "You've behaved like an idiot in that and in everything else. "It's too late to fix it now. "And if we all had myxomatosis? "Jose, Paco... "are already old. And me? Do I look as old as them?" Jose, remember when we went out...? - What? - Nothing. Look, Jose. Do you like it? Take pictures of your father, boy. Leave me alone. "Could it be that I also didn't notice at other times? "I looked like one of those old men, sunbathing on a street corner. "I have to be careful, it's only natural. "After so much time without working out. "But he's always the same. "Doesn't care about anything." Don Jos. Sit down. What is it? You've seen my mother. I brought her from the town. She was worse off there. And... just look, Don Jos, where I have to lodge her. And I don't know what will happen when winter comes around. It gets very cold here, Don Jos. That's why... I thought it would be best for her in a hospital. You have connections... that could help us a lot. Sure, don't worry. We'll see about that. Don Elas, the town doctor... you know... Prescribed some medicine. I... wanted to ask you a favor... If you could advance me some money and then take it out of my salary... That's really difficult, Juan. Really difficult. And where are we going to discount it from? - I had thought around 5,000. - Like I said. Impossible. Things aren't going well recently. If you had asked last winter, or even this one, it might have been possible. I'm sorry, Juan. I'm really sorry. - I've never asked for anything! - It will come out all right, man. I'll hear about the hospital. As for the medicine... I don't know... we'll see. I'll do what I can. Listen, Paco. "There was a fifth planet which exploded and blew up in little pieces... "The moon was bombed and so was Earth. Pieces the size of mountains fell... "from the sky on the Earth and the moon. "Perhaps a few places were saved from destruction. "An acre, a square mile. Thousands of miles apart." So what? Juan! Is there enough bread? - Two loaves. - Not enough. We'd better drive to the town to get some more. We'll need it in the afternoon. You sure it's bread we need? - Paco, can I take the Jeep? - Sure, take it. - Enrique! - What? Let's go, you can take pictures in town. Fine, as you wish. Here, Carmen. I'll make some more when I get back. You look good in the picture. See you later. Look at the pretty photo, uncle. I'm getting old for this. Too much. May I? You're getting old, Jose. Who does she remind you of? Let's see... I don't know. - I don't know. Margarita? - No, no. - Maybe Mercedes, the one that left for Italy... - Not either. This one hasn't gone anywhere. You really don't know who she resembles? Maribel... Well, not a big resemblance. But it's the same expression. The eyes, the smile. - I can't remember the rest. - Maribel? Who told you? Luis, that idiot. Don't you carry a picture of her? Not bad, not bad at all. You're lucky. A young girl like that at your age. - Don't you think they look alike? - Yeah, sure, sure. Whatever, but I like her. A little less hot and it would have been a perfect day. Yes, give me some. What are you looking at? He dries them, then sells them and gets a few bucks. The rabbit industry. All parts are useful. It's all right. We'll roast with this sun. I'll show you something. It's a secret hidden in the bushes. Nobody knows, not even Juan. And we'll go for a stroll. Good idea. I can't stand it here much longer. What are those pills you're taking? I've had pains ever since I got shot. But what are they? They don't do me any good anymore. - I also like sci-fi novels. - Really? Which ones do you like? I don't know, can't remember now. There's a lot of crap. Except Bradbury, Wyndham, Asimov and some other. - And what do you do? - I work with Paco and my father. How long have you been Paco's friend? Years. He used to drive a truck when we met him. And he owes it all to Jose, who took him away from trucking. We had a business together... that's how we met. And Arturo. - Arturo's the one that died, right? - Hey, kid, is this an interrogation? Sorry. A drink? - Do you know Paco well? - I don't know. You don't know him. And neither does Jose. Only I know him well. Your father's got money, right? It looks that way. He's always known how to make the best out of opportunities. "Flying peseta, stop your flight" Things are not so good for me this year, Paco. The separation from my wife is costing me a fortune... and business is not good. It's too hot. Come on, let's take a look at your secret. We'll talk later. What's wrong? It won't open? Somebody must have messed with this. What do you have hidden there? You didn't build an atomic shelter, did you? Nobody knows it's here. I found it years ago and left it as it was. Got really scared at the time. You'll be the first one to see it. Why don't you bury it for God's sake? Burial will not do it any good now. When did you start collecting the dead? I can't stand a minute longer in here! - I wouldn't mind spending the rest of my life here. - Here? When I saw you the other day it felt like Providence. And I said to myself: "Paco can help me like I helped him once." I don't like to abuse a friendship, but now I really need a favor. I need money. I wouldn't ask if it wasn't a real emergency. - How much do you need? - Half a million. We always need protection and help. You can't be by yourself in the world. Actually, we all depend on someone. I, for example, depend on Jose. You might depend on your father, Paco, your sister... - I don't depend on anybody. - Good for you, boy. You might be the only one. How many humiliations have you had in life? Here. But you and I are friends, Paco. Money is one thing, friendship another. Don't turn a friendship into merchandise. I can't give you money, it's impossible. - If you need a job, I can get you one. - A job? What kind of job could you get me? From the moment I saw you, I knew you were a different person. That might be, Jose. It might just be. We've all changed in all these years. And you? Haven't you changed? You bring me hunting and remind me of our friendship every five minutes! And for what? Is that your system to get money? Listen, Jose. I owe you nothing! If you helped me once it was because there was something in it for you. I won't have you insulting me, Paco. I'm warning you that I won't have it. We've gotten nervous foolishly. I didn't mean to insult you. Really. Forgive me. It doesn't matter. I swear I'll never mention the subject again. Forget it. "Hold it tight. "Mara, bring the tools to skin the animal. "Coming, there's no rush. "Las year's lamb was better looking. "This one isn't half bad. "Come on, hurry up, let's finish it." Come in, please. - What do you want? - A couple of loaves of bread. Wait a minute, I'll be right with you. - Hi, good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Take the skin. "He looks like a criminal with that knife. "How many times have I been humiliated? "Not once. "I had never thought about it. "What is Paco really like? "He seemed different today. "Something's up with him and Jose, that's for sure." Tell me about Paco. He's smart and knows what he's doing. In that sense he's not like Jose, who has his defects. Who doesn't? But he's generous. Though sometimes... Paco married your sister. Why? Surely because she had money. Paco's like that... When he has a friend, it's to see what he can get out of it. I didn't think of him that way. Stay close to Paco. That's what's best for you. Everything I've said is just advice. It's just between you and I. This is ready. Come with me. "Mother, help me take this to the pantry. "And you too, grandma, come on. "Let's hurry." Look what Luis bought. For target practice. He says rabbits bore him. We've been talking about you. - Luis told me things about the time you met. - Right. So what did he tell you? What did Jose want? It's clear you sent us to town so that you could talk. He had a business proposal, but we're not interested. We can't have secret between us. And I always do what's best for us. What did Paco say? I think I have a right to know, don't I? All said and done, I'm still your partner. Leave me alone! You never tell me anything. I always have to find out through others. - Who was Arturo? - Arturo? - What did Luis say? - Nothing, that's why I'm asking. What's Arturo got to do with it? He was our partner. When I left, he split as well. He then worked at some company. He embezzled some money and, when found out, killed himself. - Killed himself? - Be careful with Luis. He likes to muddle up things. Not bad. Very good. Look, move your arms. Arms together, close to the hips. Come on. One, two, one, two. Good. Go on. Very good. Great. Go on. If you'd fix yourself up a bit, you'd be gorgeous. Carmen! Go place the stones. - We can dance some more later and I'll take more pictures. - All right. Juan, the peppers. They don't agree with me, but just for today... It's hot, uncle. This looks like a funeral. I bet you showed him the dead guy. This is the final touch. Didn't you tell me that nobody else knew? Luis did. We found it together. Which dead man are you talking about? Arturo? Tell him, so all four of us will know. Everybody knows. He's shown it to everyone who comes down here. Jose's great secret! A dead guy from the war that he keeps locked up. - What? Which war? - Any war, what's it to you? When the sun comes down we'll hunt with ferrets. They're like vampires. I mean the ferrets. Have you seen their faces? They look like women. The females look like women. When males are in heat, they will die if they can't find a female. - That's what they say. - They're like men, then. It's obvious you haven't hunted rabbits much. There are those that raise the shotgun immediately to hunt the rabbit. That's a mistake. Take it from an expert. I haven't hunted much, but I'm learning. Rabbits and rats are the animals that multiply the most. The females have two wombs, and they're always ready. Rabbits are wonderful things. Especially if they're young and tender. Their soft skin. Their wits. Don't you want some peppers? - Jose know a lot about them. - And I hope to know more. Not much time left. The day will come when rabbits will eat up the human species. They'll invade us and form a new civilization. And since they're smaller than we are... There'll room for them all. Class struggle will disappear. There will be no more enemies. And they'll be fine. But prior to that, there will be a war against the rats. Stop that! It's disgusting. I feel I'm eating a rat. They say that in the war a lot of people ate rats. I've never eaten one, and I don't know of anyone who has. Wait, I haven't finished. I'll just continue. Since there are a lot of vampires with women's faces... - rabbits will have a hard time. - Shut up! Yes, shut up and sleep a while. You could get drunk at night and give us a break during the day. What a day. Seems like the earth will burn. "and a third of the earth was burned up, "and a third of the trees were burned up, "and all the green grass was burned up." Don't say a word to Paco about our conversation in town, OK? - You're a mischief-maker. - What do I care? Quique, help me with the mattress. - "I had a dream tonight, dad. - "A dream? - "And what did you dream? - "Things, I can't remember. - "I got killed. - What did you watch on TV last night? - "I can't remember. - And how were you killed? - "With dogs, the dogs would bite me. - Dogs? "They teach them four things, they do nothing all day and dream about dogs. "If she had been raised like I was." "You stained the shirt with my blood. "Can't you see? That's not blood! The kids. Anita! Where are they? "The kids are mine. Mine, mine! "The blood stains won't come off from the shirt. "Don't talk so loud, they'll all find out. - "Don't touch me! - "Will you open the window? - "Don't touch me! - "I need some fresh air. - "I'm choking. - "I'm going to choke. "The heat is unbearable. "Burn down that cave. Burn down that cave! - "Burn down that cave! - "Look, you're choking. "The air is clean and fragrant. "You've poisoned yourself. "You're skin is old and dry. "It's all mine. The papers are mine! "Look how my skin shines. "Look at the water drops sliding down my breast. "Help me, I can't move. "My arm is burning. "I can't move." "Moralisch ist, "wonach man sich gut fhlt, "und unmoralisch ist, wonach man "sich schlecht fhlt." "We've all changed, but Paco has become another person. "I still remember him. "He'd do anything for money. "Now he must think I'm useless, like Luis. "Like Juan... "We're roasting in this place. "And this pain..." - Who was it with the shots? - Must be that idiot Luis. Damned drunk! Do we always have to put up with your boozing? Jose! Take it easy! Take it easy, Jose! Leave him alone! - What did you do, hit Luis? - Shut up, Quique! - You don't hit a drunk man! - I said shut up! He drives me mad... I'm sorry. Come on, Jose. It's nothing. Did he hurt you, Luis? And a good thing that he didn't shoot at us. - Who knows...? - Don't blow it up, it wasn't big deal. He drives me crazy! Remember Arturo? I wish he'd be here with us. Why would he do it? I never really understood why he did it. It's hard to understand... Sometimes, you suddenly realize that everything you've done was wrong. Noting makes sense... and so... Even so, suicide in no solution. It's the worst solution. I, for example, have made mistakes. There are some who wouldn't acknowledge it But I do. If I could start all over again. - It's been easy street for you! - You found everything ready-made! And when you stumbled, there was someone to get you out of the fix. To our friendship. - Are you sorry now? - Sorry about what? Today is a good day to confess your little sins. Why did you start the fire? I was bored. Don't you like the flames? How could you put up with him hitting you? Thus shall be the end of the world. All burning in the eternal fire. Amen. - Won't the flames spread? - For what this is worth... The rabbits will be the only ones who'll be sorry. But they don't care. What with myxomatosis, the ferrets... the vermin and Jose and Paco's shots... Just a little extra heat... Luis, this is spreading. Help me. What are you doing? Put that out! Quique! Luis! Bring a branch to put it out! Come on, Quique, hurry up! Come on, come on! Hurry up! Come on, Juan! Luis! Hurry up, it's burning! Whenever you're ready, Don Jos. It's the best time of day to hunt with the critters. Are you sure there are no more exits, Jose? "Something survived. Something that is now completely forgotten. "There was rain, wind and ice. "The Earth's scars were erased over millions of years. "We don't even know where the scars were situated... "or whether human beings existed then on the Earth or on the Fifth Planet." They're ready! Jose! The critter's inside. "I don't feel well. Could it be the sun? "If a rabbit comes out, I'll let Paco shoot. "He likes to hunt treacherously. "Through the corridors in his house a large beast pursues him. "Until he gets pushed to the door, and then... "somebody shoots him in the neck. "I'm getting weaker by the day." "He says he made a mistake. "A big one... It's too late to repent. "He should have stayed with his wife. "We would all love to have a young girl with a crush on us. "The cripple looks like a ferret." Coming out! Coming out! Don't shoot, it's a sick rabbit. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! I aimed at the rabbit. They were very close together. The little creature carried out its duty, Don Jos. This happened to me before, but with a female dog. She came out of some bushes and jumped so high... that I thought it was a partridge. She was such a small dog... dead on the spot. She fell like a dead weight. I was really sorry. I like animals. Juan, how much does one of these cost you? Nothing. I'm just sorry for my mother. She really likes them. They're like little dogs sometimes. You're friend did it on purpose, Don Jos. He went for it. It's easy to make a mistake. Let's drink something, Jose. I still have to go to town. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Juan. I'm sorry. To us. - Quique. - Thanks. That was foul play, Paco. As usual. What? I can assure you that... I was just telling Enrique... that I once shot a dog. I never thought you'd do something like this. What are you on about? Give me a break for once! Why are you loading it? You never know. I'm sorry about what happened, Luis. How could I? I'm really sorry. I don't know what got into us today. What do you say? Forgive me, Luis. Luis! Come with me, Luis? I'm going to hunt rabbits with this. Only a sick rabbit. I bet you anything I'll get one before we leave. Come with me? Be careful with Jose, he's very nervous. No one has hit me yet. I can't stand Jose any longer. I'm definitely cutting loose. I made up my mind. Got a job for me, Paco? I want to ask you something, Luis. Is it that bad for him? Worse.
