He was totally out of control, they had to kick him out. You better deal with this. Good morning. Detective Ferris, Detective Howe. Listen, maybe we could just start with the last time that you saw Natalie, and we'll go through events one thing at a time. It's me again. This can't be happening. My car's dead. It's not starting. I'm stuck on the side of the road, like, I don't know, five miles from the bar. I need you to come get me. Why aren't you answering your phone? Where are you? The third factor is outcomes: The results of these strategies in action. We're not just making predictions here, not just what we think is going to happen, but what are all the other possible things that don't happen? If we want to understand, say... Amanda. Hold on. Wait. Wait a minute. If you need someone to talk to... I mean, I could be that person. You're a really good friend, Mark. I'll be okay. It's just a room. It has nothing to do with Natalie. I can't afford to pay for an empty room anymore. Can you? Hey, I'm Zoe. Hey. Hailey. Nice to meet you. Yeah, you too. Hailey. Amanda. Nice to meet you. - So this is your first year? - Yeah. What do you want to study? Well, I grew up on a farm, and I work in an animal hospital, so I've been thinking about vet sciences. So this is it. Wow. TV room, cable, DVD player. The fireplace works, but we have to go easy on the wood because the ashes can get messy. My room. Amanda's. And... This would be your room. It's great. # Let's not be so nice ## Hey. Hi. I made you some tea. Thanks. It looks nice. Yeah. So have you had a chance to check out campus? Little bit. I got the basic tour back in spring. Well, if you want, I can show you around. I appreciate the offer, but it's okay. Look, there are some really cool places I'm sure that they didn't show you. Sure. Great. I heard about Klein. That's amazing. Who's Klein? Maria Klein. Uh, she's like all over the news about that DNA databank thing. Yeah, Amanda interned at her office all summer, and now she's got a big job lined up after she graduates. Where'd you hear about that? Everyone's heard about that. Klein's a big deal. What? Does she know? Know what? Natalie was my friend. She lived in your room. I'm living in a dead girl's room? She's missing. Nobody said she was dead. Look, I'm sorry. Maybe we should've said something. Forget it. It's just a room, right? I'm gonna go. Yeah, um, it was nice to meet you, and I'll see you later. She used to make us do the craziest things. This one time my freshman year, I was having a hard time. You know, school, boys... My parents were always away. Natalie knew this. Anyway, so she woke us up at the crack of dawn, and she shoves us in the car. She drives us to the country and doesn't tell us where we're going. She booked a whitewater rafting trip. I was terrified. I mean, I was afraid... I was scared of the water, the raft, drowning... Fucking bitch knew it too. But she had a way about her. You know, it's like... It's like that she knew what was good for you. So did you do it? It was the best trip of my life. She was one of those girls, you know? No matter what you were going through, or how shitty life was, when she was around, everything was okay. I remember seeing her in the papers and everything. I never really paid much attention though. What happened? Natalie was a waitress at The Black Swan. She worked one morning till 2 a.m., and that was the last time anybody saw her. We put up posters, talked to people in the bar that night, read the papers, followed the news. Just trying to fit the pieces together, you know? Sometimes I even go to that spot where her car was found and try to imagine what happened. Every scenario in my head is bad. Hey. Like you said, she's missing. She could still be alive. How've you been? Haven't seen you in a while. How's your new place? Fine. You gonna stay for dinner? I went shopping. I have to go. Mom said I could have it. If you need money, just ask. Wait. Take it. Look, I just want to talk, okay? Figure this out. There's nothing to talk about. Look, I fucked up, okay? I know that, but we're supposed to be together. You said that, you remember? I was wrong. Now move. Move! Amanda, please believe me. I had nothing to do with Natalie! Don't make me say it again. Hey! Hey, you guys are leaving already? Yeah, so excited. Have a good weekend. Thanks. See you later. Pacify certain interests in the country, Maria Klein's announcement last week effectively killed legislation that would have seen the creation of a nationwide DNA databank for missing persons. By allowing jurisdictions to opt out, well, this makes the databank next to useless before it's even started. Meanwhile, the families of missing persons continue to suffer, and they continue to wonder whether their loved ones have been found and not identified. For this reason, Klein? I am not supporting this legislation. Yeah. Are you worried people are going to blame you for this not going through? My message to them, and Mr. Shaughnessy, is this: Do it right, or don't do it at all. The families of missing people, they deserve better. Hey, that's you. Yeah, that was like a week ago. What did you do for her? A lot of things. Primarily, I watched her back, till this happened. One of her rivals backpedaled on some legislation, and I was the one who caught it. Next thing I knew we were in front of the cameras. You look good. - legislation that was ill-conceived and full of loopholes from the get-go. It was never going to see the light of day. If I hadn't revealed it when I did, someone else would have. If people want to blame me for its failure, they can go ahead. What? Nothing. The questions people should be asking are, why were jurisdictions given the option to opt out? And why wasn't it mandatory for all law-enforcement agencies to participate? It's a major setback, but I don't intend to let this die a quiet death. # Tell me is this true? # # Tell me is this true? # # One day we'll disappear ## Hey. Hey. Sorry, I thought I heard someone. I don't hear anything. Oh, for chrissake. When are you gonna get it through your thick skull? We're done. Now get the fuck away from me, or I'm calling the police. I love you. I always will. Don't you see? Hey, get your fucking hands off her! Get off her! Who the fuck are you? Come here, jerk-off. You'll find out. Listen, bitch, this doesn't fucking concern you... Fuck! Fuck you! I can't believe I ever got mixed up with that guy. He was one of the last people to ever see Natalie alive. He was there that night at the bar. I know he had something to do with it. I can't prove it, I just... I just know. I told the cops, but they couldn't do anything about it. The guy's sick. He's obsessed. I don't think he's ever gonna stop. Mm, gotta go. Get the fuck back here! Bitch! No! No! No! No! Get off of me! Get off me! He has a gun. Fuck you. No! No! The cops will never believe it was self-defense. Amanda. Think about Natalie, okay? The police did nothing. We can do this. Now help me. Hey. Don't worry. No one's home. Zoe's not home yet, so that's good. It's over. Never happened. Say it. Never happened. Say it again. It never happened. Hi, um, I have some information about a dead body. On a farm. Yeah, it might be that missing girl, Natalie Ross. Garret Jones? You mind if we ask you a few questions? What's that over there? I don't know. - Detective! - Excuse me. All I can tell you is a male between the ages of 20 and 28. No teeth, no fingerprints. His face is destroyed. ID'ing this guy's gonna be a bitch. Anything else? My guess, it could be a mob hit. My property's 115 acres with access to three different roads. Anyone can drive in there, kick open a gate and dump whatever the hell they want. Just because a body's found on my property doesn't mean I had anything to do with it. Oh, we got your ax. You got someone's ax. You got my fingerprints on it? No. And you know how I know? Because it's not mine. So if you have any evidence linking me to this crime, I'd love to hear it. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I thought. Found a set of tire tracks out near where the body was found. Now, it doesn't match your vehicle or anything else on your property. Any idea whose vehicle those tracks belong to? Not a clue. A local man was taken in for questioning today after human remains were found on his farm. Police were led to believe the body was Natalie Ross, the girl who mysteriously disappeared four and a half months ago. But police confirmed the body was an unidentified male. The death is being treated as a homicide. No charges have been laid. Holy fuck. Hailey, we're in a lot of trouble. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What happened? My dad dropped by for a little visit. Your dad? What? I called the cops. What? Wha...? You called the cops? Why would...? Why would you do that? Are you fucking crazy? Shit! Hailey, they can identify the body and trace it back to us. Why would you do that? Why?! Because the son of a bitch killed my mom. My dad used to beat the shit out of my mom on a daily basis. I grew up watching her take it and take it. The last few years she had nothing left. She was just a fucking zombie. I woke up one morning and she was dead. Officially, it was a suicide, but I know it was him. And then he moved on to me. I was lucky this time, because he was sober. And he's gonna get to drinking again like he always does, and he's gonna think about what I tried to do to him and it's gonna screw in his brain, and he's gonna come back and he's gonna kill me. There's a way that we can fix everything. We solve both of our problems. We kill him. What? We can pin it on my dad so the cops think my dad killed Cameron. Okay? There's no trail leading back to us. I can't listen to this. Look at what he did! I killed for you, now you kill for me. You're sick. # If I cut you with these scissors # # And make it go away # Can I stay here with you? Of course. What's going on? # My timid hand shakes and waves # # Oh, I notice things # What happened? # I wouldn't have days ago # # The mind is hard to know ## Well, what are we talking about here? Trouble at school? No. Pregnant? No. Hmm. Are we talking about something illegal? Yes. I got myself involved in something and I don't know how to get myself out. What are the chances you get caught? I don't... I don't know. It's a little difficult to give you advice. All right, let me ask you this. Have you learned from this mistake? Yes. Yes, absolutely. Show me one person out there who hasn't done something illegal. I suppose if it were me, I'd do what I had to do to get out of it without getting caught, and then I would never do it again. We're just human beings. You know, we make mistakes. But we can learn from them. We don't always need the law, because we have our guilt and our conscience, and sometimes that's more than enough. It'll be okay. Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? I'm so glad that you called. There's something that I have to tell you. Hello? Mark? I think you should come home. We need to talk. What the fuck did you do? Well, I think that's pretty obvious. You didn't really leave me much of a choice. You're fucking out of your mind. Oh, you're fucking crazy. Holy shit. Where is he? Calm down, he's fine. Who you calling? You calling the police? Okay. But remember that I still have the ax, and it has your fingerprints all over it. Officer, it's wasn't me. Why would I kill him? I mean, it's her ex-boyfriend. I guess they got in a fight and when he wasn't looking she put an ax in the back of his head. Pop! You fucking bitch! Do it! Aah! Do it! I don't wanna hurt Mark, so don't make me hurt Mark. Fuck, Amanda, you're free. I just want the same thing. Help me and we both get what we want. I can't kill your dad. It's Mark or my dad. You're going to kill somebody. He'll be at the bar till they kick him out. Give me that. How do you know that's enough? Internet. Apparently it's sweet. It doesn't taste that bad. Put that under the sink. Who the fuck is that? It's just someone turning around. Happens all the time. Okay, printer works, lots of ink. We're set. This is where Natalie worked. Like clockwork. She's not gonna go. That's exactly what you'll do. Only you're gonna get in that truck. I'm a murderer who can no longer live with myself. I'm a murderer who can no longer live with myself. That's what the note should say. Keep it short and sweet. Print it off his computer, get his fingerprints on it, and after you're done, wipe everything down. Don't touch anything. Hey. Hey! Remember, he's a crafty son of a bitch. He's fucking smart. You have to stay one step ahead of him the entire time. Look, we can do this. Okay, this is a good thing that we're doing. It may not seem like it now. # You might've been right I might've been wrong for you # # A fallen angel's what you are # # A fallen angel's what you are # # You get around You travel far # What can I get you? Um, can I get a beer, please? Yeah, you bet. # You played the game Just like you said # # Let me try to ease your scars # # A fallen angel's what you are ## Okay, so I sign here? Great. I didn't know you were in tonight. Uh, ahem, I switched with Marie. I'll need you to get Mrs. Newlander some Meloxicam, the 8-milligram tablets. She's out in the waiting room. They're not doing too good, are they? Excuse me. Can I get a tequila sunrise, please? Yup. You bet. You want one? On me. No, thanks, I'm not really a big fan of those sweet and fruity cocktails. Aw, come on. Can't knock it till you try it. You might change your mind. What's your name? Aren't you a little young to be honing in on me? I'm older than I look. No, you're not. What are you drinking? Doesn't have a name. Just like you. What's in it? Half glass beer, quarter glass whiskey, quarter glass 7-Up. That's a cocktail. No, it ain't. A cocktail has two or more ingredients in it, and one of them has to be a spirit. A whiskey's a spirit, so that, my friend, is a cocktail. Yeah? What are you, cocktail police? # You had it all You never broke your back # It's not bad. For a cocktail. # You had your stuff You put it in a box # For the lady. Try it. # You cried to the moon To the sky # # Was my happiness my sacrifice? # Well? # After you happened # Do I know you? # All # # Lost # # The object was no cost # # Fell # # Down # # After you happened # # All # # Lost # # The object was no cost # # The object was no cost ## You can still change your mind. If Mo shows any signs of distress, give her another painkiller. Okay. Are you sure you're okay? I'm fine. # I am the one # # Who's disappeared # # This one's for forgiveness # # So they say # # I'm that one # # I am the one # # Has no name # # I have no name # Is that your daughter? Yeah. That's Hailey. She's pretty. # Who has disappeared # She is that, all right. She gets her good looks from her mama. I can see some of you in her. # Who has disappeared ## Where is she now? She moved away. She doesn't come around here much anymore except when she, uh, needs to steal something for money. # Every night # # It's the same # The kid's pretty messed up. # I wait for you ## What do you mean? She hurts herself. Cuts. Bruises. I don't know why. One time she threw herself down a flight of stairs. The poor kid looked like she was in a car wreck. Her and her mom didn't really get along. There was a lot of friction there so... Maybe that's when it started. When her mom died... When she died... She committed suicide. She poisoned herself, which is a horrible way to go. I've never told anyone. There was something about it that just wasn't right. You can tell me. She left a suicide note, and it blamed me for basically everything. The thing was printed off the computer. I was married to that woman for 16 years and I never once saw her use that computer. Sometimes I think about starting over again. Um... Finding a new woman to share my life with, have another kid. Try and do it right this time. We never do get a second chance to fix the big fuck-ups in our lives, do we? No. No, we don't. So, what's this fruity concoction of yours, huh? Does that have a name? We're through. Do you understand me? It's over. I want details. I want every single detail. Don't leave anything out. I don't know where else they would've come from. But they, uh, popped up and started... They started grabbing me and I, um... I don't know. I don't even know if it was a man or a woman. I was wondering if you could do me a favor. I've tried calling my dad and there's no answer. I'm stuck at school and I can't make it there. Is there any way you can check on him since you live so close? Uh, yeah, I could do that. Great. Is there any way you could go today? I'm getting kind of worried. Sure, I'll head there now. Thanks. - Hello? - Hailey, hi. It's Mrs. Farnsworth. I went over to check on your dad and I knocked on the door but there was no answer. The door was locked so I just looked around but I didn't see anything. I mean, his truck was in the driveway, maybe he's gone hunting. Hey. Is everything okay? Hailey? Drive. Get out. Mm-mm. We're gonna go for a little ride. Get out of my car! What do you want? Look at me. Drive. Drive! This is fucking crazy. Shh! Where is he? I don't know. That's fucking bullshit! Maybe he crawled off and died somewhere. Wait. Don't drink. I have to tell you something. About your daughter. You know my daughter? Yeah. What are we gonna do? You do what you came here to do. You carry out your plan. Did you get it? Good. How do you know she'll come? I know my daughter. What are you gonna do? The girl needs help. I'm gonna see she gets it. Now get the fuck out of here and never come back. Go! Amanda! Get in the hole. Go on. Get in there! Get in there! Get in the fucking hole! Get in the fucking hole! Look what you made me do. Shh. Shh. We're free. Amanda? Natalie. Who's that? That's his daughter. He told me his family was dead. Said he wanted to start a new one. Come on. Let's go. 911. What's your emergency? We need an ambulance. I found her. Natalie Ross. I found her. What's the address? We're at the end of Little Mountain Road. I don't know the number. The police have been here before. Last month they found a body in the woods. I was involved in that. I knew him. His name was Cameron McClure. I helped bury him. Ma'am? Ma'am, are you still there? Yes, I'm here. I'm not going anywhere. # If I cut you with these scissors # # And make it go away # # Personal wars we wage # # My timid hand Shakes and waves # # Oh, I notice things I wouldn't have # # Days ago # # The mind is hard to know # # So keep your eyes On the road # # Hold me like an old friend # # Hold me like an omen # # If I cut you with these scissors # # And make it go away # # Feverish dreams of rage # # The river runs separate ways # # Oh, I always knew I wouldn't be # # Here for long # # The singer but not the song # # The scissors Cut deep and long # # Hold me like an old friend # # Hold me like an omen # # Hold me like an old friend # # Hold me like an omen ##
