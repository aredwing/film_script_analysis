If I did, I'd end up feeding books to my old man ! Come on champs ! Get ready for races. I'm timing you now. I've understood. It's about wheel balance. Bhum, Bindaas, Abdul, you and I- let's hit the sump-yard on Sunday ! Hey Arjun. What are thinking ? Little drops of water, fill up the ocean. Little grains of sand, the earth. Moment by moment, time collects to form age. You dare not call the moment small, for it's the creator of all. Where is he ? ! Here he comes. Can't you ever come on time ? ! We've been waiting for so long... My old man bashed me up so badly early in the morningm. Your old man also doesn't wear a shirt does he ? As if your old man wears a gold threaded jacket ! Why are you wrapping my dead old man in a gold threaded jacket ? Why do you always say 'old man, old man' ? Can't you say 'father' ? Why ? Calling him 'father' will change the fellow ? Hey Bindaas, check that out. Bro... What are you doing ? Its tickling ! Its a good sign. I feel awkward... You, at my feet... I can't get over it.. Don't do this to me... Come with me... Time and again, you plead and say.. 'Don't do this to me.' Cut the jokes Lucky. Get serious. Try and understand. Its been four years... Some times its the Russian coaches... ...some times a skating camp in Pune ! Other times championships or applications ! Don't I mean anything to you ? This street sport of yours... ...has trashed all my dreams. You know... back home hangs a big photograph of Mom and Dad... Everyday I look at them... and... I feel so guilty... Come on little one... go for it. Take a small turn... ready steady go. Swing... no half hands. Well... its not simple. The shops sell them for 30 ! 30 grand ! Some are for a hundred thousand ! But I'm sure we can make it ! Sure ! Why not ? ! All 4 wheels in a line... not like a car. And smooth... and balanced ! I've seen those. Where ? ! Where could you have seen ? It was first time even for me. Seen them he says ! You're the master mechanic... I'm just your servant... Your student ! 20 cars to attend to... and I'm stuck with your toy ! Shall we proceed... with your permission ? So when did I say no ? All 4 wheels need support strips on both sides, welded here. Got it Shekhar ? Yes boss ! What Uncle ? ! This is not scrap. It's treasure ! Where are you staying ? My brother stays there, I'm going for a holiday. Thank you. What ? Why are you staring ? I told you I'd do it, didn't I ? May I wear it ? Wear a shirt first !

I'll try them after all of you. Flying Wheels is ready, kids ! But where will she ?y ? Hundreds of potholes here... Where and how will she ?y ? Bandm Kurla. Good. But tomorrow. It's late now, get some rest. Sq ? We've all got work tomorrow. A man's got to work in the day, not play Flying Wheels. Nice name... Flying Wheels ! It's very simple. I saw it the other day. Nothing to it. Walk like you walk, the wheels do the rest ! Hey ! What's so funny ? It happens the first time ! Murugan, give me a hand... Hey... Don't leave my hand... Don't leave... How will you learn if I keep holding you ? No no no... Why are you laughing ? When your soft buns hit the hard road, I'd like to see your faces. Hey brother, enough ! Enough ! Enough ! Enough. What happened ? Nothing. Can I stand and eat today ? Stand and eat ? You mean... graze like a cow ? Look... look. Don't look down. Look at your turn. Deep cross steps. No, keep it. Mr. Aniket Bhargava ? - Yes. Your U. S. Visa. It's come. Powerful hands. Let them ?ow. Nice. Nice Ankita. As you increase your speed I want you to lean more forward. Saw ? It's very simple. Wow Arjun ! You've tmnsformed. Into what ? - Superman ! No, no. I can barely do it. You've come this far, just by watching when Mr. Double Sugared trains you... you'll become a champion ! Pray and come tomorrow. We'll set you up with him. Get up now... Bro, what are you doing ? It's time for class. Hurry "P ! And why are you packing my shirts ? I'll wear yours... It's for just a month ! Who knows ? Once there, you might change your mind. Hello Speak out winding ways... twisted trunks... speak out ! Why so quiet ! Shout out Mother Goddess, shout out ! Excuse me ? Madhu Rye's Ashwatthama It's opening on Sunday. How many seats shall I keep ? Oops ! Actually... I'm leaving for New York tonight. But if you say so, should I postpone it ? Hello ? Abandoning your country, you traitor ? No no... just going for a short while... Only for bmhmaand (universe)... You mean, for a bhmman (journey), don't you ? Same difference. No ! Bmhmaand means universe. That's a long journey. If I get back, I'll call you. What ? Shall we go ? But what if you turn into an American bug ? If I wanted to turn into an American bug... I would have followed this great one long ago. I wouldn't have stayed on. Champs, it's just a matter of one month. Come on now... Come on ! Okay. I'll tell you what... I want all of you to give me your best today, so I can leave relaxed So champs. North, South, East, West... Roll-o-fit is the best ! That's the spirit. Okay then... Go... go ! Oh Lord, of curved trunk, massive body, and with the splendor of a million suns, please bless me so that I do not face any obstacles, in any of my endeavors. I don't know how to pray but still... I'm trying for the first time... There's always a first time... In the name of the Lord. Keep your eyes on the turn. Raju ? ! Then the tribal boy Eklavya, made a statue of Dronacharya in the jungle. So what if the great teacher Dronacharya refused to train him ? The boy didn't accept defeat. He practiced archery, drawing inspiration from the statue of his teacher. Relentless practice resulted in Eklavya transforming into the best archer of that land. You are just like Eklavya, Raju. Who's Raju here ? Why ? Isn't he Raju ? That's Arjun ! Our Eklava. And his Flying Wheels. Flying Wheels ? My friends created her. Fabulous guys ! Arjun, you want to learn skating ? I'll teach you. Starting tomorrow. In the evening...at 7. Here. At 7 my boss won't leave me... Then you leave him. How much does he pay ? I'll give it to you. Boss pays me for work. I don't accept charity. Okay. I'll wait. Will it be okay if I teach after class ?

Grips the road so tightly. Oh, that's just mechanical stuff. But, Bindaas, what scrap you sourced ! Scrap is scrap... It's Abdul's gold threads that give it the show. Look how they shine ! Nothing more than mere blouse sleeves. But you sat up nights and made them. I didn't do a thing... and yet I'm gorging on this feast. Look at this idiot... It is yourjasmine garlands... that have made her divine. Aunty, the food is excellent. Did you call for the taxi ? Should I call ? How many times do you want me to say sorry ? I tell you what... I'll come over for Christmas. Promise ! It's not about that. - Then ? This is sheer madness ! Ridiculous it is ! Barely 2 months to the district championships and you say that you'll make that tin soldier a champion. Just look at this ! Look. Our childhood memories are hidden in them. This is my life ! It was yours too ! You moved on... I can't ! That boy is a champion ! Just imagine... five little kids... put together a working pair of inline skates out of scrap. I feel so motivated !

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Mumbai district championship 2013. All contenders please head to the registration desk to collect their numbers and fill up the forms. Buys age group 6 - 8 please report to the registration desk at the starting line. Hi Lucky. Isaid 'Hi..' Oh ! Hi Pmgya... What's the matter ? Something wrong ? One of my boys hasn't turned up. So call him. No Pmgya. He doesn't have a phone. I don't know what to do. Sir ! 12 - 14 age group... Flying Wheels is not here. Pmgya I'll see you... Bhatt where's Arjun vanished ? Wasn't his race today ? He didn't show up. Don't know where he's disappeared... He mustn't not have found the address.. He must be wandering looking for the place... No no... I had explained it to him. His mother was supposed to come with him. He hasn't come here. Then where has he gone Bhatt ? ! I don't know, Sir. These kids come in for 3-4 months... then they find better pay and leave... But how can he leave like that ? It was his District Championship ! He can't disappear like that ! It's ridiculous ! What ? Nothing... Do me a favour. Take my number, and call me as soon as he comes... - Yes Sir... Don't nod, write it down ! - Yes Sir 9920... 9920... 981970 ! 9 ? - 981970 ! Do you know where he lives ? Not really. Somewhere in Dharavi slums... his aunt has a shanty near the putters' quarters... Yes Bhatt... Sir his friend is here to collect his dues. Who is it ? Let me speak to him... Yeah ? - Who is this ? Sir. Gochi. Arjun's friend. Where is he ? ! - In the hospital. What ? ! Which hospital ? Bandra General. Sir ! Sir ! Sir ! Not there. Here... on the ?oor. Arjun. What happened to him ? ! He was blabbering deliriously with high fever... Now even that has stopped... When did you get him here ? - It's been a couple of hours... I dropped him off here and rushed to collect his money. Has a doctor seen him ? The one who could've filled the form has only passed out. Gochi go stop a cab ! Arjun.. Arjun... You are the mother ? What do you people do ? How could you let it come to this ? Severe hepatitis... He's got hepatitis. How many days since he's eaten ? What have I done ? All day on his feet... coming late and passing out... refusing to wake up... I thought it must be fatigue. God ! These people just don't understand. He's crushed with exhaustion ! The child isn't eating... He's passing out hungry... and you didn't think he needed a doctor ? What were you waiting for ? Him passing out ? ! This one mistake can cost you his life. Why do you make him work ? Is it the age to work ? Doctor, please save him. What do you think I am doing here ? No, no... I mean... please don't spare any costs. Granny will just light this lamp and be with you. Brother Arjun is very ill... I have to complain to the Almighty. Lucky... Here. Look at our champ. Because of Sir, he's alive at least. Otherwise he would've kicked it. There is no difference between garbage and us. We come close, and the window slides shut. Damn it ! Clutch it like this... push it down ! Shout straight into the face ! 'Look there !' 'That's a gutsy fellow !' 'The day he gets a chance, he'll wrench it !' 'He'll beat you hollow !' He's our Eklava ! You got it ? ! What did you say ? 'Eklava' ? He winked ! Arjun open your eyes. Wake up, Arjun ! What happened ? - He opened his eyes aunty ! Arjun ! Arjun ! What's happening here ? ! I saw him wink ! - Out ! Out ! Come on ! Out ! What happened ? - No clue Sir. He's been crying since he regained consciousness. Forgive me Sir... Wha... What happened ? I lost Sir. Race is over... What are you saying child ? I lost... Stop this nonsense... Stop it I tell you ! I lost, didn't I ? Grandly I set out to feed him cake on a golden platter... slipped and fell face down into the cake. Skating, skating, skating ! Am I blind or what ? My champ is sinking... and me ? Who is this Arjun Harishchandm Waghmare ? Where does he live ? What does he eat ? Does he eat at all ? I don't know. And yet, I'm teaching him skating... making him a champion. One more gold medal... one more feather in my cap. As for Arjun... With a medal dangling, he'll be back to sewing tea. And I ? I'll pay my taxes, stop at red, move at green and feel very good. V9 FY, Very good. What's on your mind Sir ? Your plate is empty. Why so lost ? Just thinking... So deePW ? When you see children going to school... parents picking them up, dropping them... What do you think ? A burden worthy of a pack-mule, lunches double their capacity. Poor guys are tapped. And you all are free ? No meals... no school. We didn't ask for it. From where the Lord ?ung us, we rose and marched on. And destination ? - Destination meaning ? Who doesn't dream in this world ? Doesn't want to fulfill those dreams ? Surely you've got dreams too. What strange dream did you see last night... that has gotten you in this mood ? Do you really want to know ? Isee... that all of you are in school. Instead of red and gold threads, Abdul has a nice pen in his hands. Instead of garbage, Murugan is picking up a book. Gochi is painting on a canvas with a colourful brush. Bhum is reciting a poem... And our Eklava- Arjun- is marching back with the gold. One dream at a time... Let's fulfill that first... right Sir ? But that race is over. What about the dream ? We all dreamt it together. It's shattered, isn't it ? It's not the kind that shatters when you wake... Let our champion recover. Then we'll set him up right ? Of course... But where ? In the State Competition. But Mumbai District competition... is over, right Sir ? There are 35 districts in Maharashtra... and on our champion Arjun Harishchandm Waghmare's form, it shall be written... Kolzhari Village, Yavatmal district, Maharashtra... From where nobody has ever competed. I had set out to teach Eklavya... and I landed with 5 Pandavas ! At first I thought I was changing their lives... now I've understood that they've changed me forever... Such small children... and such big hearts ! I've hit jackpot Brother. North-South-East-West- Arjun Waghmare is the best ! Food for the entire ward ? No doctor... the food's here. There you go. Special delivery ! Wear it and scoot off. Wow ! Ask Sir to tell the doctor... I want to begin. He's ?ying ! Strong, creamy, doubly sugared tea. New here ? Yes. What's your name ? Raju. Bhatt you're too much ! Bend down ! Nice ! Shriya bend down ! Focus ! Focus ! Why is the fire brigade painted red ? Pass. Everybody pass ? - Pass. Because it has 8 men and 4 wheels. 8 plus 4 is equal to 12, 12 makes a foot, foot makes a ruler, ruler reminds us of the king of England. England is next to Finland, the tip of Finland points to Russia, Russia's ?ag is red. That is why the fire brigade is painted red. Sir ! Look ! Who has come ! The great American bug ! Sir ! Look ! Sir ! Look ! I don't believe this... Bro ! Bro ! What a surprise ! I've taken leave and come. I want to see your dream come true. So... North-South-East-West- Roll-o-fit is the best !

Your single entry from Yavatmal ? Where is his birth certificate ? It must be here somewhere... This is somebody's death certificate. What ? - Some Harish... chandm What is all this ? The boy is Arjun Waghmare right ? - Yes... I'll have to disqualify this boy... Rathod... give me 2 minutes. Please... Arjun... Arjun... where is your birth certificate ? Your father's death certificate has been submitted... Mother must have... by mistake. She has it... She has it... The mother has it. She is getting it. I can't wait for this boy for this long... But she is coming... Aunty ! Sir is calling you over there. Oh God ! Hope everything is okay... Excuse me.. There she is ! I have it, I have it... Birth certificate... By mistake I... Easy, easy... I have it... Take it out. It's in here somewhere... Madam, please take it easy. Not this... This seems right. Let's go back on the mark. There's nothing... Nothing. No ! No ! nothing ! Even this time nothing ! These are not seeds... they are poison. Tam ! These are not seeds... they are poison, Arjun ! Arjun... Come. See what's happened ! Father ! Get up ! Father ! Father... Arjun ! Run to the clinic ! Get a doctor quickly ! Hurry ! Run to the clinic ! Arjun ! Run ! Go ! And it's no surprise... Sohan Tarkar at number one, Jaival Shah at number two, and unbelievably, Arjun Waghmare at number three ! Such brilliant skill and footwork ! Speeding ahead with the wind and he's number two ! This is going to be one tough ace and Arjun is clearly on a mission charging along. And the blazing boy has his target set. Trailing on the south bank and this is spectacular ! Arjun marks number one, leaving state champion Sohan Tarkar behind ! Pushing hard, using all his might- look at this little wonder go. He is number one at the end of lap one. Five more laps to go ! Arjun ! Go Arjun go ! Fly Arjun ?Y ! Fly ! Ariun, carry on ! It's the right thing to do Arjun... Do it ! Who can understand the value of your tears ? Arjun go ! Arjun GO ! Arjun GO ! Arjun GO ! That's Arjun ! Our Eklava. ...and his Flying Wheels. Arjun go ! If not for yourself do it for your friends ! Do it for Flying Wheels ! Go Arjun go ! ! The skate slowly hitting the tar once again. And he's off ! Arjun Waghmare using all his might- the crowd egging him on. He's got a lot to cover up to get back into this race and it's looking really tough at this point of time. Come on ! Ahead of him- Rohan Budhmni at number seven. The boy from Thane hasn't had a great run so far. Arjun Waghmare- covering up the lead at the south bank going full might, full force. And he's closing in and he's taken him from the outside edge. Going to number eight to seven within a distance of hundred metres. Look at him go. Oh my god ! This is unbelievable. Vansh is finding it difficult to maintain his speed and he slips away ! Lets go of the inner lane and Waghmare capitalizes on it. Gets in through the inside edge and secures his spot at number 6. Arjun, 5 more skaters to go ! Up ahead, we have Bhumik. Not wanting to let go of his inner lane... trying every push to keep Naytik at bay. I must say it's very unsportsman like for the skaters. And Arjun finds his way through the battle ! Their loss is Waghmare's gain. Oh my god ! He has done it again. Come on ! Come on ! And there's Aamir Shaikh, famous for his sharp mind games. And he is blocking him, not allowing him to get past. Arjun struggling to find a way out. Aamir blocking every attempt of his to get ahead. And what is this ? Arjun slowing down. He is letting it go once again. Has the run been too daunting for this debutant ? Aamir Shaikh looks extremely pleased with himself. We'll lose the race this way ! Go ! Now. I can't believe this ! A burst of speed from the little boy. It's a trick ! A trickier trick. He's taken Shaikh completely by surprise. And he is going all out. Speeding like never before. Spellbound- that's what we all are. Come on ! Arjun... Last lap. Come on... It all boils down to this final lap. Sohan Tarkar continues to lead the pack at number one. Jaival at number two. Arjun Waghmare at number three closely followed by Aamir at number four. There's no doubt that this one's going to be one close finish. Within reaching distance of the finish, nothing to set the four apart. Who is going to win this one ? Just a straight run of fifty meters left to the finish. A last burst of speed as they give it their all. Twenty meters from the finish now and it is still too close to call. YES ! And this is unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable. Arjun Waghmare has done it. His first state race, his first championship. What a victory ! Arjun Harishchandm Waghmare bags the gold. He won ! Let's see if you all can recognize this. What letter is this ? 'N Very good children ! What letter is this ? 'N Very good ! Letter 'A' ! Aye ! ? Aye ! Boys ! What's happening ? What letter is this ? 'N Very smart. Shall we all clap for ourselves ? Very smart children. Can the whole class repeat ? If we don't like it... We'll run off... Very smart children. 'Hot Embers' Just the way hot embers singe the fingers before you earn the bread, the fruit of life too, you shall get when you have walked on hot coals ...that's the order of life. Wow Champ... Straight from here to Bandra Kurla... The Nationals entry forms have arrived. Next month, Chandigarh.
