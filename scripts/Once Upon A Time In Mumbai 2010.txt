Inspector chauhan, please come in. Inspector chauhan, please come in. Please come in, headquarters calling. Why don't you answer it? It's been buzzing all day. Let mumbai burn. I'm not moving from here. What do you think? Who could've done this? Only agnel sir can answer that. Sir. - What happened? Agnel sir has regained consciousness. Come on. Sir. What happened? Who was it? Who did this? Just give me his name. He'll rot in jail for the rest of his life. Tell me, sir. Who was it? Agnel wilson. What? I've already investigated. Nobody's behind it. What do you mean? - I mean he tried to commit suicide. What nonsense... - chauhan, there's no dent on the car... ...nor any damage. I inquired with the villagers. There was no accident or brake failure. They saw him drive the car into the gorge. You will have to tell me, agnel. Why did you take such a big step? Why did you try to commit suicide? You're giving up at a time when i need you the most. Were you trying to evade your duty... ...or were you scared? No sir... i was trying to evade myself. But i won't die so easily after the trouble i've put this city into. You're not responsible for what's going on in the city, agnel. Mumbai is dormant in the sound of explosions. And the reason behind it... is me. I tried to lock horns with one man. But today... the entire city is paying the price. Which man? Who are you talking about? Sultan mirza. Sultan mirza? This story began with sultan mirza. Few years after the independence... ...madras was graced with floods. After losing everything... ...that small boy came to mumbai. If it wasn't for the floods... ...then sultan and mumbai might've never met. He got a job at the docks. I heard that he was paid only 25 paise... ...after working all day in the furnace. Even at that juvenile age... ...sultan knew how to conquer hearts. If you give me this money then what about you? Blessings. I'll thrive on your blessings. You're an elder person. And with your blessings someday i'll make it big. You don't have a penny... ...but talk like a 'sultan' (emperor). That day he got a name. 'Sultan'. His juvenile age and innocence aided him. The journey to be the master had begun. No one knew that one day... ...a stowaway would rule the seas. But it was reality. Because he had only one principle. Sultan, we shouldn't help pathan. He's our enemy. Patrick, when we can be friends... ...then why take up enmity. The truck is loaded with gold worth 600,000. The police know this gold will be smuggled in the city. That's why there's strict security on every road. The goods will be delivered. But how will it be possible? - Just like you were. With the grace of god, hard work and lot of dedication. The job will be done. We need to check. Check properly. - Yes, sir. What's inside this? Why aren't you raising the barricade... ...we're getting late. We'll miss the train. Sultan. Sultan! Get away, sultan! Move! You're brave and compassionate. You'll be respected by all. Sultan was in love with mumbai. He didn't want mumbai to be gripped with terror. That's why he had a meeting... ...with pathan, vishnu, wardhan and varghese. Each has cunning men. They're strong. If we fight amongst ourselves we'll be at loss. Think about it. Do you want to end it all... ...or make a new beginning? What... do you want to say, sultan? Which station do you have the most influence, wardhan? Dharavi. - Fine. From dharavi to parel station... ...none of us will interfere in your work. Sultan, what if we don't agree to this division? I wanted all of us to prosper in our business. There. Kill each other. If we fight each other it'll make the police's job easier. And not for us. Pathan, when we can be friends... ...then why take up enmity? From dongri to sion station is your area. Varghese, from colaba to tardeo is your area. I've heard that you speak fluent english. It'll be useful. Vishnu, from bandra to versova. You're dividing the city as per the police stations, sultan. They might be police stations... ...but we're the commissioners of the city. Sultan, you've divided the entire city amongst us. What about you? To be precise, entire mumbai belongs to me. And i don't need a piece of land for doing business. I have the sea. The sea unites india from the rest of the country. If we control the sea our ships will never sink. Those who had the strength to change circumstances... ...were the ones that were alive. They began smuggling everything that we banned. They used the law to climb the ladder of success. Mr. Dagger. Owns six mills. Had a quarrel with his brother. It's the police's job. I will have to pay them as well. I don't do everything for money. Sultan, don't disappoint me. Hail a taxi for mr. Daggar. Why would i take a taxi? I've a car... - as i said, i don't do everything for money. Please spare me something, son. Feed him well. And pray for me. I'm not scared of the law, get that. As soon as i'm released... ...l'll throw you out of the house. Hey, quiet. Come on. Who are you? I hate those who don't respect their mother. Remember the name. Sultan mirza. Sultan was with everyone. Sultan extended a helping hand... ...to everyone that the government failed to. The old fables had only one king. But there are two in this one. One became the king with his courage. And the other was obstinate about becoming one. Hurry up, quickly. - Yes. Hurry up. - Yes. Stealing. What's your name? - Shoaib khan. And you? - Javed. You haven't started wearing pants yet and are already stealing. It's easier to run in knickers. Back answering. Come to the police station. You won't get a medal for getting me arrested. Keep half the coins, slap me few times... ...and end this matter right here. Petty thief, what are you saying? You're speaking as if you're sultan mirza. Who is your father? What is his name? I'll call him to the police station as well. There's no need to call him. You'll find him right there. He's a police officer. Sub-inspector khan. - What? Forget it, sir. Father will beat. - You'll learn your lesson then. Come to the police station, come on. You're bigger and also stronger. But remember, as i grow up you will grow older. As i grow stronger you'll grow weaker. Then i'll deal with you. I'll settle the score with you then, with interest. Old man. Why are your needs growing out of control, shoaib? Tell me. Tell me. You've no shame or apology. Look down! Look down! I will teach you a lesson today, shoaib. Khan, what are you doing? You've slapped him five times. Let him go. He's only a child five slaps, that makes six with interest. Every child had the desire to be like sultan. But sultan had only one desire. Rihana. The most beautiful and important link of this story. Rihana. Congratulations, rihana ma'am. You were terrific. Congratulations. Give me a chance as well, please. Sign my film as well. - Rihana. Thank you very much for attending our magazine's party. My pleasure. You acted as a child as well... ...and even today you're a successful star. Such a long innings, rihana. How do you feel? Whenever i would act as i child... ...it would seem like a game. And now i work because... ...l'm no longer of the age to play. This time you've won the best actress award. But don't feel too proud. Four of my upcoming films are with kaka. Do you know what people call him? Actually, superstar... - ma'am, one last question. You're everyone's dream girl. But who is your dream man? It's neither a superstar nor a jubilee star. My dream man will be the one... ...that wins my heart in seven seconds. Is everything set? Chandru, stop the car. Rihana ma'am is here. Just a minute, brother. It's your first meeting. Don't go empty-handed. This is bigger, it must be expensive. Sir, pick anyone you like. They all cost 25 paise. Consider that this is the last guava on the planet. You won't find anymore guavas. How much does it cost now? - Four rupees. Consider that mumtaz has grown it herself. Salim would carry this guava and not a flower. How much does it cost now? - Forty rupees. Consider that adam ate this guava and not the apple. How much does it cost now? - Four hundred rupees. Yes. Four hundred rupees. Get me a chair. Why don't you rest here until he gets a chair? Women can't rest until men like you are on this planet. Don't pretend to be too decent. You're an open book. It won't make a difference if i read a few pages. It'll benefit you, get it. Better learn some decency. It's much more important for you. A small gift for you. Please accept it. Who are you? I bought it for four hundred rupees. I couldn't find anything expensive... ...so i bought it for a high price. Take a look everyone. Rihana's admirer has bought a guava... ...worth four hundred rupees for her. You've given it, now get lost. Would you like to have dinner tonight with me? Silly man, have you lost it? Does rihana have dinner with ordinary people like you? Those who have the same destination... ...meet on the path. Hey poet, stop reading your sonnets. Or i'll knock your lights out. What is this? What are you doing? I'm trying to express my feelings and you're butting in. Have you lost your mind? Do you know who you're talking to? I've seen some of your films. You laugh just like a dog panting. I'll have you thrown out right now. Laugh. - What is your name? Laugh. Laugh. What is your name? Laugh. Come here, boy. Tell him my name. Sultan mirza. Sultan... sultan... l'm terribly sorry. I really don't know how to act, sultan... - quiet. Tonight at eight, i'll wait for you. At your favourite spot. Sultan. Sultan. Rihana. - Quiet. Sir, menu. - Potatoes and cauliflower. Okay, sir. Potatoes and cauliflower today as well? Right sir. Sir, your favourite potatoes and cauliflower i don't believe it... ...but i knew that you'd surely come. Sultan mirza, right. What are you doing here? Didn't i say, i'll be waiting for you at your favourite spot? So i'm doing just that. You still remember that. It's been 15-20 days since that incident. - 18. I've been waiting for the past 18 days... ...and eating potatoes and cauliflower everyday. Why potatoes and cauliflower? I heard that it's your favourite. Shall i order it for you? You'll have to eat alone today as well. I'm not here to see you... ...but for hearing the story of a film. And order bitter gourd today. I like that as well. Ismail. - Yes, sir. Bitter gourd. - Okay, sir. Are you here to listen to a story... ...or will our story finally move ahead? A restless man ends up burning his tongue... ...and can't savour the food either. Can i say something? Whenever any hero touches you on screen... i close my eyes. Why is that? I don't know. Whenever you're on the screen... ...l'm seated on the seat. Why is that? I don't know. That film 'unpade bhav'. When you tell the hero... ...that i'm pregnant with your child. I swear, you weren't looking pregnant... ...and i even decided a name for the baby. Can i... touch you once? - Why is that? I always bought a ticket to see you. Today when you're before me... ...i want to see whether it's a dream or reality. Who are you? - Sultan mirza. I know your name and have seen its effect. But who is sultan mirza. - I don't know. Don't ask why is that. Happy birthday. Do you have a dictionary... ...which makes it easy for you to understand? Why is that? You said that it's your birthday celebration. But it's just the two of us. I heard that two people can make up a world. Can't we at least celebrate? And anyway i'm celebrating for the first time. Why is that? I never came across anyone... ...who was happy to see me alive. I never enjoyed celebrating my birthday either. Many people would arrive with lots of gifts... ...and i had to pay the price. And that was not agreeable. Even today those moments give me a nightmare. I've brought three gifts for you. There's a riddle with every gift. If you solve it, the gift will be yours. The first gift. Since childhood you've been in and out of this thing. One such thing. Jail. - No. Handcuffs. White shirt. Just as you like it. Don't you like colours? - No. I love black. - The reason for this liking. I spent my childhood in dark nights... ...and my youth doing dark deeds. I used to work at the docks. I would fill coal in the crates. And that darkness became a part of me. To be precise, i would shed black tears... ...and see black dreams. Since then these eyes haven't rested. My second gift. It contains something that you've kept away from your neck. That law. It's a tie have you ever seen me wearing a tie? Have you seen me eating a guava? But you did bring it for me. You can forget about the third riddle. It's a watch. Take a look how it is. What happened? Didn't you like it? But it isn't working. Mr. Mirza, it doesn't function on its own. Wear it on your wrist. It will work according to your heartbeat. I hope the heartbeat controls this thing. This shouldn't control my heartbeats. Because if it stops then i might... i finally found you. God brought me closer to you. I chanted only you. I sung only about you. I finally found you. I hid you from everyone. You were my only dream. I dreamed only about you. You entered my life and made it complete. Love became my religion and my creed. I finally found you. God brought me closer to you. I chanted only you. I sung only about you. I finally found you. I hid you from everyone. You were my only dream. I dreamed only about you. You entered my life and made it complete. I dream only about your love. Now my days and nights are filled with glitters. You entered my life and made it complete. I finally found you. God brought me closer to you. I chanted only you. I sung only about you. I finally found you. You have made my life. You were my only dream. I dreamed only about you. The distance isn't romantic. Let me hide you in my arms. You are on top of my list of my desires. Everyday i wish to meet you. I won in love but lost my heart. You entered my life and made it complete. This is the time when i was posted in mumbai. Mumbai is always gripped with darkness. And this darkness also houses... ...some dangerous people. Shoaib. Where are you going? Where are you posted today? - Bandra. For the first time you're headed the right way. I'm going that way as well. Take a look. You hit this one. Father. - What? See you. Father's been posted here tonight. Should we postpone it for tomorrow? If i postpone it for tomorrow... ...then today day will feel bad. Come on. What's the job? What are you doing? What do you want? What do you want? Look, you've been badly thrashed. You can't go home in this condition. Do you see that house? - Yes. Go there, ring the bell call the doctor... ...and keep the door open. Come on. Save me. Save me. Who is it at this late hour? Take a look. Who are you? What happened? They're beating me, save me. - Who is he? Save me. It's paining. They both thrashed me. This is expensive. How is it, ma'am? Show me that one. This. This is the latest design. They're nice, but i can't make up my mind. Shoaib. You can't understand which one to buy... ...and i don't understand you. Get lost. - What? Get lost. Shoaib, what are you doing? Wait, ma'am. If you don't leave... ...l'll strip of the jewellery that you're wearing. Shoaib, what are you doing? What is this insolence? - No, ma'am. Please sit, take a look... - i don't want to be slandered. Ma'am. Ma'am. She's aged yet she wants buy jewellery. Ma'am. Ma'am... you'll never reform. This is the age to be spoilt. Don't spoil yourself so much that later... ...you won't be able to reform. - I haven't even... ...spoiled myself completely yet. And you're trying to reform me. Just tell me why you're here. Do you want to sell it? - I want to adorn it. Who? - Her. You. Who did you steal it from? What did you say? You think i'm a thief! I cut people's throat. Fine, i don't want to give it to you. Shoaib. Fine, don't get angry. Leave my hand. Where else will you go if i leave you? Sho... shoaib, what are you doing? Spoiling myself. Shoaib. - You can reform me. Couldn't you wait until evening? If i had waited until evening this morning would've felt bad. Shoaib. Shoaib, leave. Agnel, you've to eradicate crime and not just stop it. The mafia's in bombay and they're growing. If they aren't stopped... ...then no one will be able to do anything. Just five men who aren't evenly formally educated... ...yet they control the entire city. Their reach is better than national television. Any personal enmities? - There could've been. But sultan never let there be any. He divided them to bring them closer. You do know her, don't you? Everyone knows her. Famous film-star rihana. What's more popular is... ...these days she's getting too personal with sultan mirza. Everyone else keeps a low profile. But sultan's in the news everyday. Think about it. The youth today that have to move mountains... ...for a small job. For them sultan is god. Follow his path... ...and bungalow, car, film-star will follow. The crime world might be filled with comforts, sir... ...but they all lead to the jail. It's not easy to put him behind bars. The task can be difficult, sir but it's never impossible. You leave it to me, sir. Good luck. Ramu. Moti. Where is everyone? Why isn't there any light in the house? - Cut. Who said cut? Full lights. Who said cut when i'm present? Take the camera. Seal everything. Get everyone in the line, come on. What's all this? Who are you? First you say cut now you're giving out directions... ...who are you? This isn't a movie scene but a governmental raid. And the government has appointed me to direct it. Acp agnel wilson. Bombay police. Stop everything, come on. Sir, madam is refusing to stand in the queue. She's no ordinary person, murli, but the boss. Sultan mirza's favourite. So she's bound to be egoistic. There's no point in showing attitude to me. I'll believe it only if you do the same before sultan mirza. I'm sure sultan mirza will hear... ...about my attitude and my message. We've strong evidence to prove that... ...rihana's lover sultan mirza is investing in all her films. Sultan hasn't earned this money through right means. So a movie made from illegal money is illegal as well. Stop everything. - No, please don't do this. I'll suffer losses worth millions. If you want to restart shooting your film... - yes. Then next time cast a star... ...that doesn't have any contacts with smugglers. Even better if he hates them. Otherwise, your films will begin... ...but i won't let them end. Come on, stop everything. Madam, we still haven't received permission... ...so the shooting has been cancelled today. Its either the location or scripts not finalised and sometimes the hero doesn't give dates. So the shooting's cancelled today as well. Fine. For me this is just like betraying the country for you. It's better to be disloyal than betray the country. Love means more then me than being loyal. Then what are you doing here? Staying alive is much more important. A person's weakness is far greater than his strength. You're sultan's weakness. And your weakness is acting. You had me sacked from two films. You won. Have you got the evidence? What other motive can i have to meet you? Here. What's inside? Lts sultan darkest secrets. Quickly take a peek inside... ...before someone sees me with you. Please. Please, don't print this photograph... ...otherwise everyone will know... ...this inspector has accepted bribe to leave me alone. That's front page news, madam. It'll be published. Oh, god. Please move. Move. Let me go. At least tell us the reason for bribing the acp. - Let me go. Jai hind, sir. Aunt. You always bring me good luck. How is your son? He's growing up just like the inflation is. Think about your son and not the inflation. Get him educated. I'm there. You do so much for me. Just pray for me. Sultan. He turned out to be very cunning. Agnel sir never realised what hit him. A cheap newspaper tarnished his honour. What will you do now, sir? Transfer or resign? Who are you? - What, sir? Who are you? Sohail khan. Your rank. Inspector sohail khan, bombay police. Crime branch. Do you have a wife? Do you sleep with prostitutes? With my wife? You work for the police. Sir, no one can blame me for that. Do you misbehave with your parents? Do you mistreat them? What are you saying? I don't want to rot in hell. When you don't do anything wrong... ...inspector sohail khan, mumbai police, crime branch... ...then why are you praising a goon's deed. If now your blood doesn't boil hearing sultan mirza's name... ...then i'll not spare any of you. No transfer, no resign. I'll kick you out. Your trick worked, sultan. But the war is far from over. I just need one clue, an opportunity... ...a pawn to finish you. You'd be facing trial and rotting in jail if it wasn't for me. That boy saw you but i... i turned the case. I said my son can never do such a thing. Don't stare. Rot in prison for today. That's the consequence for such deeds. Sit. Father. So, you finally learnt your lesson. No, you're so stupid. You didn't lock the door. Why you... khan. It's good to be hot-blooded. But it can ruin you if it steers out of control. There's no point in being calm. Others take advantage and then dispose off. The law is made to calm such hot-blooded people. I feel the law is just like my father. Weak, helpless... poor. - Quiet is that your law? One slap, some preaching. One night in the cell. An advice. When you're addicted to something... ...it becomes your identity. I want to create an identity, sir. What else is there to do in this city? Even if the path's twisted. If i think about the path... ...my destination will turn its back on me. Hello, sultan. Which horse have you bet on? Six. But you are not here for that. Get to the point. We'll talk once the race ends. What will i do here once the race's over? Say it. It's personal. My son's getting out of control. I locked him up yesterday myself. He doesn't listen to me. He's getting spoiled. If you... i thought if you can do something... get him to serve the country and the police like you. Its not his cup of tea. He's hot-blooded, doesn't listen to anyone. That's why i've come to you. All my life i never asked anyone for anything. Just this once. If you can help me... you've many legal business... ...which are not under the scrutiny of the police. Please appoint him. He'll be reformed. Come on. Brother sultan is here. Brother sultan is here. Hello, brother sultan. Hello, brother sultan. Your father never accepted a bribe. So this is a debt, work hard and repay it. And make your father proud. I don't want to hear another complain. I will try. To at least keep you happy. Thank you for helping shoaib. We're in love. Thank you. You've made contacts with the right kind of people, shoaib. You'll certainly reach your destination now. So, khan. In the last 18 years you never bowed down. But now you've changed your master. Shoaib, take a picture of us together... ...and hang it in your shop. Pick one of us whenever needed. What are you doing here? Did you run away from the shop? I didn't run away. I made my first sale. I also brought a gift for you. - Then give it. Here, in public? Come on, to the corner. Come on. Don't you know which shops sell gifts for women? Why? What's wrong with this? I also have snacks. Couldn't you bring cakes or pastries? That's for birthdays. I made my first sale, it's not my birthday. One mumtaz gets the taj mahal... ...and the other gets this. You don't value my love. Do you know how happy my friends are to see this bottle? Then go to them and celebrate with them. Why are you being so considerate about me? I never celebrated with a girl before. You drenched the cheeks i wanted to kiss. Come on, hit me. Hit me. Don't cry, hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me on the other cheek. You hit so softly. Hit me harder. You're always looking for an opportunity, aren't you? A real man... never let's go of an opportunity. Let me take away your sorrows. Let me hold your hand and take you away. It's the season of falling in love. With you love's beautiful. With you there's intoxication. With you i feel at peace. With you i feel restless. You're my fate, my destiny. You're my fate, my destiny. Why shouldn't i lose my senses? You're cuddled in my arms. You're like a river. Seeking for the ocean that dwells in me. Let me take away your sorrows. Let me hold your hand and take you away. It's the season of falling in love. With you love's beautiful. With you there's intoxication. With you i feel at peace. With you i feel restless. When i come see you in the evening. The morning gets upset with me. Every moment, every hour, every instant... ...your memories torment me. Let me take away your sorrows. Let me hold your hand and take you away. It's the season of falling in love. With you love's beautiful. With you there's intoxication. With you i feel at peace. With you i feel restless. With you love's beautiful. With you there's intoxication. With you i feel at peace. With you i feel restless. Dongri is like a volcano. Always fuming. It won't be right for you to go there. I didn't travel to mumbai from delhi to hear that... ...i can't roam freely in my own area. I'm sorry to say, sir... ...but this situation would've never arisen... ...if you politicians had thought about this earlier. Those people haven't prospered... ...or developed since independence. They're only reclining, due to the poverty, helpless. Their anger has turned into a fierce storm. What are the police for? There're not enough policemen to cover each lane. If anyone hurls a slipper at you... we cannot guarantee your safety. If the police can't guarantee my safety then who will. Sir, there's one man. Who is he? - Sultan mirza. Look, the minister's here. Move. Clear them. Move, move. Move, please. Look, if you have any complaints... ...then tell me about it. I've come here for you. No one's saying anything. Everyone's just staring. All hail... - sultan mirza. All hail... - sultan mirza. All hail... - sultan mirza. All hail... - sultan mirza. All hail... - sultan mirza. All hail... - sultan mirza. The government has come to you. Listen to what it has to say. Speak, sir, everyone's listening. Join politics, you'll win for sure. If my cabinet gets elected... ...then you'll have no where left to go. Smugglers live the real life. The entire world's at your feet... ...and you can walk over it. That's true. But not everyone has the guts to be a smuggler. A new employee always praises his bosses. Just because a sultan gave you work... ...you think whatever he does is right. Even the government couldn't give me what sultan did. Means of living. So tell me, who's greater? The government or sultan. The man you're praising is a sinner. We cannot judge what's wrong and what's not. If he steals from one he distributes it in others. If he's a killer, he's also a benefactor to others. I don't want to be his master or his slave. All i say is that... ...there's a reason behind his every action. There's a reason, money. Of course. And he's in a hurry to earn money as well. It's not about money. The power involved is unlike anything ever experienced. Concentrate on your shop, shoaib. If it was me... ...i would've restrained any further relations with them i don't want be friends either. I just want to make it big. After that the world will be at my feet... ...and i'll walk over it. They're no match for my jewellery which was stolen. And what're you smiling at? Will you show us some more jewellery? If you really cared for my jewellery... ...you would've been in the police station. I've called them umpteen times. - Madam. Madam, can i show you a necklace? Look. First take this one off. The one you're wearing. - No, ma'am. It's not for sale. Rascal, thief. Take it off. - What? Take it off! - What are you saying? Look, raman, this is my necklace. It bears my symbol. Take it off. - You thief, wretch. Madam, you're crossing your limits. I'm not retaliating and you're calling me a thief. Fine, you might've not stolen it. But you must have bought it from a thief. What's wrong, madam? - She's wearing my necklace. It was stolen from my home. Ask her where she got it from? Sir, i'm not a thief. Shoaib gave me this necklace. Shoaib? Where can we find shoaib? That's him. Look, he's the one. Didn't i tell you? Thief. - Yes. He gave you a stolen necklace. - Yes. He's the one that broke into our house. - Yes. He tied us up and stole everything. - Yes. Mumtaz. What yes? Take a look inside whether our stuff's inside... ...or has he sold it? He can't sell our stuff, he absolutely can't. Hey. Where is our stuff? Our radio, our television. See, everyone, this man broke into our home... ...tied us up and stole everything. Shikha, there are two of my watches. Are you listening? Are you listening? Shoaib. - Raman. Shoaib. - Raman. What are you doing? Do you want to kill him? Leave him. Don't hit him. Raman. Shoaib. Call the police quickly. Or he'll kill him. Raman, call the police. Someone please call the police. What are you all staring at? Someone call the police. Also call the doctor. Sultan sir. How did you bet on a loser? He ruined everything. What else can you expect if you put a man in wrong profession? Forget about being grateful to brother... what attitude. He did a favour to my father and not me. Give me a chance to work with you. You'll profit double the amount that you lost. You think this business is a child's play... ...where anyone can do as they please. There's nothing that can't be conquered with courage. Courage is not something to be spoken about... ...it's best displayed. Stop them, sultan. Or else they'll kill him. No pain... no gain. You said... that i should choose one master. So i did. Now... do you have the ability to choose the right man? What did you say? Nothing. From now you'll say only what i want to hear. Chandru. - Yes. Teach him the trade. Get up. Come on. Sultan, i think he isn't the right choice. We don't have jobs for the right ones. He'll surely do something big. Why? Because... he values his victory. Sir... i made a big mistake. Shoaib has joined sultan in his illegal business. I don't know what to do, sir. No matter how dark the night is, khan... ...the dawn always brings light. Shoaib is blinded by the glitter of sultan's world. The day he takes off the blindfold... ...he'll come back to reality. And one of us is there. We won't let anything happen to him. Don't worry. I'll handle everything. Some people take up a fast pace... ...to leave their past behind. Shoaib was one of them. His name appeared in every complaint, every file... ...and every report. Then i felt that after all he's khan's son. So shoaib can be used to take down... ...sultan, wardhan, pathan, vishnu and varghese. But that was the biggest mistake of my life. I tried to play with fire. And the fire broke out. That's a steel lock and not a cloth that you can... - wait. I doubt it. No one can open this lock in a minute without the key. Stop your nonsense. And pass me that wire. - This one? Give me that wire. Shoaib, what's that? What is that? That belongs to the police... ...where did you steal it from? I suggest that you throw it away. We don't require it, throw it away. This is a gun. It makes everyone bow. Whoever controls it... controls power. Either the game changes or the player. Shoaib. What are you doing? Leave him. - Move it. Javed, explain him. I just need to move my finger... ...and that'll be the end of you. Leave it, shoaib. Let him go. When we'll together stand for sultan mirza... ...it'll double his power. Double. A person normally gets romantic after drinking. Talks about the moons and the stars. But you slip into flashback. When you run from your past... ...you can never win in life. I've been sharing a drink with you for the past two years. You drink everyday and become poetic. A person should change with time. Time never changes... it only passes away. What would you've changed? Everything except for you. Excuse me, ma'am. Autograph please. Thank you. I'll always keep it close to my heart. So i don't mistakenly spend it. Thank you so much. That's how india is divided in two parts. The rich tore a 1000 rupees note... ...which didn't make a difference to him. And the poor have never seen a 1000 rupees note yet. I've an idea. Someone should make a film on you. It'll be a success before it's released. So will you make me act now? I can make someone else act. That new boy, amit. The new superstar. He'll suit perfectly. His eyes are similar to yours. Very expressive. Shall we order food? Yes. How is the food? - Hot. Like you. I mean how does it taste? Tangy and spicy like you. You're just... i never understand whether you're speaking the truth... ...or fooling me. That's one habit about girls. When we speak the truth they say we're fooling them. And when we fool them they believe it. Can i ask you something? Will you be honest? - Yes. I hope that necklace incident is not repeated again? Don't ever... talk about that necklace... ...or my failure again. I just want to succeed. Move ahead. I've forsaken those petty ways... ...which held me back. At least finish the food. I bought a new house... ...so you don't have to live in that crowd. Look at me. This... is a nylon silk shirt. Do you know how expensive it is? There's a two-in-one, phone. How many have them? What is all this? Progress. I work for sultan mirza. Do you know what that means? - Yes, i do. And i know how dangerous the job is. Yes. Yes, i'm on my way. Sultan, rag picker manya at teen batti... ...has sent a message. Agnel knows about our plan. Manya is two-faced. He must have given this information to agnel. Now that agnel knows... ...he must have blocked all roads. He won't let our vehicles through. What should we do? Return wardhan's money? Our respect will ruined, sultan. Those who bow before us... ...will steer clear of us in future. What should we do? It's easy to say such things, but not to do this job. There's nothing to worry. We'll break through the barricades. Hey, have you lost it. Let me plan something. Let me first take care of the job you've promised. Then i'll get rid of our loop holes. And i can execute both the jobs. All the influential people of mumbai are present here. Builders, cricketers, actors and actresses. The mayor's present as well. Having a drink. Shoaib, let's go back. I feel strange amongst these people. Sultan has called me. He invited me especially. It's his party. He said there won't be any party without you. Come on, come quietly. Meet my wife. - Hello. Thank you. Celebrating before the job's done. I'm slightly crazy since childhood. I know how to fix you if you don't get the job done. Brother, normally in birthday parties... ...children don't leave without a return gift. Today these people won't either. So, what's going on? - Nothing. We were just chatting. You'll get bored standing here. Let's go have a drink. Do you want to get us fired? Don't worry, we'll drink what they're drinking inside. Come on then. - Fine. Get hold of a posh tailor. I want you to stitch clothes like sister-in-law, rihana. You've an awesome figure. It should show. What are you saying? Are you too drunk? You're uttering nonsense again. I'm not the caterer to drink after everyone leaves. Shoaib. I needed your help. But i don't know how to say it. Say it. I need your photographer. Photographer? For what? Actually my photos are being published... ...in the newspapers these days as well. But it's horrible. I was thinking of getting a nice photo clicked... ...and have it sent to them. No matter what i do... ...but the picture should look nice. You want to be like sultan, don't you? A bit, i like his style. Our party is better than the one inside, isn't it? Drink away, the night is young. Shoaib is doing good work. Get married. It's difficult. These days he tries to imitate you. You didn't get married... so he won't attempt it either. But before that... maybe... - she never talks any sense. Don't even try to make sense. Is the job done? - Its partly taken care of. It'll be done once the party is over. So the party's over. - Suddenly? I invited them. So they'll leave on my order. That's the mayor's car. Who can stop him? We'll check sultan and his cars. - Fine. Open the gate. - Open it. Open it quickly. It's the mayor's car. I want to check the car and not the mayor. Open the boot. What is this insolence? Being the mayor, you're returning from smuggler's party. And calling me insolent. Let me do my duty. Open the boot. Check it. Open the bonnet. What's wrong, officer? It's a checking. Open the boot. Hurry up. Firstly the monsoon and now this checking. Sakharam, open the boot quickly. That car as well. Leave. Check properly. There's still much left to load. That was fun. - Hurry up. Shoaib, you were terrific as a police officer today. For the first time father's uniform has come in handy. Careful. It contains watches and transistors. Why are you being so hasty? I'll slap you... is anything broken? No, shoaib, it doesn't contain anything that can be broken. And sultan is not going to like this. Hello. There's no match to the cheetah's speed... ...the grip of a python and the cunningness of sultan. This boy has done this job. I wouldn't have ever brought the goods here. Sultan, i can never believe... ...you don't fail to do a job that you undertake. Will you believe that today's my birthday? Come, lets cut the cake. Sultan, you should've informed me earlier. I would've got a nice gift for you. Tell me, what do you want? Tell me. Do you have a match? - Matches. Here. Sultan, what have you done? Have you gone crazy? Do you want more profit? Do you want a larger share? Then i will do so. But... - wardhan. I only smuggle things... ...which the government doesn't permit. And not things which my conscience doesn't permit me. Shoaib didn't stop after that job. His new ideas, thinking, helped him progress in the business. He started smuggling goods in ambulances. People were terrified by him. But i had turned a blind eye... ...because shoaib was getting closer to sultan. Shoaib was... searching for a man. My informer... who was deceiving them. In this world... people are... often... duped. Just a gaze... steals their heart. In this world... people are... often... duped. Just a gaze... steals their heart. Two young hearts. The eyes speak. Let no one come between them. These mysteries. Why be so mysterious? These mysteries. Why be so mysterious? Monica, oh my darling. Monica... oh my darling. My lovers deceitful and passionate as well. Why wonder what he wants when i am in love with him. Where should i seek love? The entire world's my enemy. The one you trust. Walk up to him and say... these mysteries. Why be so mysterious? I broke his leg. But he fled. You know what to do... ...when the horse starts to limp. Sultan has sent a message. Bet on the limping horse today. Tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock. The ship's name is al marina. He's here. Look, he's here. There's restlessness growing every moment. Youth is anxious. I am restless, you're restless. That's the saga of this ruthless heart. There's restlessness growing every moment. Youth is anxious. I am restless, you're restless. That's the saga of this ruthless heart. The heart's smouldering. My heart's your abode. Come dwell in my heart. Where else can you go? These mysteries. Why be so mysterious? These mysteries. Why be so mysterious? Monica, oh my darling. Rihana. Sultan, what's happening to me? You'll be fine, hold on. Patrick, hurry up. Don't let me die. Patrick, hurry up. Sir... - wait. There's a patient in the car, we're in a hurry. We need to go to the hospital. Let us go. Come out. Didn't you hear? Go away. I think you didn't hear. Rascals, you smuggle gold in an ambulance... ...and patients in the car. Do you think the police are fools? Come out. Driver, open the luggage boot and let me check. Hey, officer... you want to check the car, don't you? I'll show you each and every corner of the car. Leave me. Leave me. - Look. Look. Take a look. Did you find anything? Is there any gold? Let's check the luggage boot now. I'll show you the entire car, come on. Take a look. Is there anything. Look. Sultan. She's suffering from congenital heart disease. Meaning? I didn't understand. I mean there's a hole in her heart. Often infants contract this disease in the womb. It is detected at childhood itself. So now? There's no cure to this disease. A few more years. I'm sorry, i'm really very sorry. Look after her as much as you can. You come with me will you marry me? You're the heart of mumbai. And mumbai is very dear to me. I've learnt much from you. I always marched forward like your waves, untainted. I never heeded or bowed before anyone. But the only mistake i made was... ...that my love was divided. Now you tell me who i should listen to. Are you thinking about leaving this business? I can leave everything mumbai has given me for rihana. No worries. The only thing i'm worried about... ...is that mumbai has a big-heart. I'm scared that someone might shatter it. Everyone's keeping quiet only because of our business. If we leave the business... ...everyone will find their voice. What i am today is not because of my business... ...but my decisions. This city has always heeded my decisions till date... ...and it will do so in future as well. No, sultan. If we leave our business... ...we'll give our enemies a chance to stand against us. After that as the fear is over, so will be our lives. And the law will be after us. You need brains and not business to keep them in control. I'm only changing my way of living and not my attitude. He's after me today. He's... brother. Hello. Hello. It wouldn't have swayed so much when it was full. So why now? We were just playing. - So play. I would've been ruined... if not for you. Till a horse is not beautified... ...he looks like a donkey. As long as you're behind me i'll never tire or stop. Then use your mind. I'm going to delhi. I'll be gone for a long time. Until then... you will handle the business here. And remember, this isn't your property or a donation. I will try not to let you down this time. You won't get a chance either. Sultan has divided this city into five parts. Just like druapadi. - You utter nonsense after drinking. I'm not joking, javed. Only two people are adequate to run this city. Sultan and me. The rest are pushovers. What do you want to do? I want to kiss it, hug it and play with it. Do everything that'll take me to new heights of success. Higher than sultan. I don't want to be any lesser either. People call him smuggler. Sultan will call me don. He'll give me a hug. Try to see from my point of view, javed. It feels like we've trapped someone's darling. If we lose this opportunity... ...she'll slip out of our hands. I'll destroy her but not let her slip away. How much longer? The minister's slightly busy. He will see you. But you will have to wait for a while. Shoaib, there's a job which only you can do. I want to bump off my brother. After the job's done... ...my man will give you this piece of catechu. Match them and handover the money. Will the job be done? I won't deceive you. This is just the first success, javed. Just watch how i turn this 500,000... ...into five million before sultan returns. Sir, sultan sir comes everyday to meet you. What should i say? Who am i? The home minister. And him. A petty goon of mumbai. Does he think i have the time to spare for him? Let him wait. There's no special trick to sell alcohol... ...which only wardhan knows. Its so easy even chandru can do it. Now we'll have our own brewery. The profit will be ours. Call kaalia. Sultan will kill all of us. You know how much he detests kaalia. He doesn't trust kaalia at all. He trusts me. That's why he handed his post to me. Just do as i said. Don't try to rack your brains if you don't have one. I've heard entire mumabi is scared of sultan mirza. But he's sitting here so timidly. The truth is when he'll show his true colour... ...the person sitting inside... will run for cover. What are you saying? He's a dangerous man. Don't be fooled, stay quiet. It's easy to fire the gun. But just as difficult to keep it safe. None of us has ever used it in our business. Times are changing. If you want to do business peacefully... ...then we'll have to start using it. Fine, wait until sultan returns. If i wait i'll be left behind. Wardhan and pathan will win. They aren't our enemies, shoaib. There are no friends in business, patrick. What we want doesn't make a difference? What sultan wants is more important. But sultan isn't here at the moment, it's me. You snore just like you lecture. Long and boring. - You? How did you come here? Minister, i haven't become so ordinary... ...that anyone can stop me from going anywhere. What is this insolence? I mean... what do you want? Ministerial post. Name your price. That's not possible. These days the government... ...is giving permission to form new parties. Since i grew sensible... ...i did everything which the government doesn't permit. What will the government get if you get the permission? Sultan mirza is all you need. The opposition won't stand a chance. I want every bottle that's being made in shoaib's brewery. And throw all the alcohol in the gutters. No one should know that the police is behind this. Understand. You want to erase all evidence, sir. That will only encourage, shoaib. Kaalia has given his statement. his alcohol. We can't we arrest shoaib? What good will that do? Didn't sultan kill dara? What happened? He was bailed out in 10 minutes. He will get bail as well. We're merely their publicity agents now. We arrest them and they get bail. You mean we should try to cover their acts. I'll shatter their unity in such a way... ...that they'll never think about coming together again. Their strength lies in their unity. Once that's broken... ...everyone will be in our fist. But who will shatter their unity? The same shoaib whose acts we're covering up. But he's close to sultan. He isn't close to anyone. But why will he go against sultan. He has already gone against sultan. I didn't understand. Sultan might be involved in wrong deeds... ...but he never polluted the city. He ruled the seas... ...that's why people are still safe on the streets. But shoaib chucked all his principles in the sea. So when two people with different morality confront... ...there's bound to be collision. But the one that's moving slower and has older values... ...will suffer more loss. I don't care about those two. I just want the city unpolluted. But shoaib is... khan's son. Someone will have to make a sacrifice. This mammoth city... is in the palm of my hand. It's a known fact. The guns are blazing. We march ahead with a bold heart. This is our time. It's a cocktail of cash and comfort. We're underground. But everything's available here. Baburao's having a ball. He's having a ball. Baburao's having a ball. He's having a ball. We didn't have a penny in our pockets. Now there's a sea of wealth before us. We're the uncrowned king of the underworld. If anyones stops us... ...we kill him ...and bury him. Everthing is adjusted. But everything's available here. Baburao's having a ball. He's having a ball. Sultan, i've arranged for a rally in your area next week. We'll announce that you've joined our party. Prepare yourself. There'll be poster all over. For votes and not wanted. The world's a selfish place. It's a thankless world. No one feels compassionate for you. We snatch whatever we like. We rule this place. The entire system is right under our feet. Live carefree. The guns are blazing. We march ahead with a bold heart. Everyone standing back in the line. But we're first. We're underground. But everything's available here. Baburao's having a ball. He's having a ball. He's having a ball. Baburao's having a ball. He's having a ball. Those who make promises on the bed often forget. I'm different. You're dance as good as you love. Stay close. I'll make you an actress. You took so long to return. You know how the government functions. The minister has organised a rally in our area. Just watch, soon my car will have flashing red-light as well. You're a murderer! Return me my son! He died after drinking your poisonous liquor. He's dead. You killed him, you did! You will never live peacefully. You'll rot. - Shoaib. Murderer. You will rot in hell. Singhania has been waiting outside. A man makes big when people wait for him. Go and send him after a while. Close down all your business before i kill you. You can dress up like me... ...but you can never be me. Patrick, i want the city clean. Stop it, shoaib, don't drink anymore. He shouldn't have slapped me. When i was a child... ...father compelled me to go against him when he slapped me. I'm no longer a child nor is he my father. I thought he respects me more than his father. That's why i entrusted the business to him. But deceit is his nature. He deceived his father, he deceived me... ...he'll deceive mumtaz... one day he'll deceive this city. It was my fault. I thought we'll rule together. But there can be only one king. I made him my soldier... ...but he's out to be the king of the city. Sultan doesn't own the city... ...that everyone has to follow his orders. Wardhan wanted to do something, he stopped him. I wanted to do something, he stopped me. He's been bitten by the political bug. Wants to be a minister. This business will only be controlled by the bullet... ...and not lectures. He committed murders for money. It's difficult to control people... ...that are addicted to bloodshed. That means it's impossible to stop shoaib now. Shoaib, think before moving ahead. Could this be the wrong path? This is my path, my decision... ...and this city will be mine as well. Get that. What's wrong with you, shoaib? I'm scared of you. What are you saying? I thought you're different. But now i feel i don't know you at all. Who are you, shoaib? If i answer this question... ...then your question will feel bad. Enough of question and answers. Now i want to see... ...whether he confronts me or backstabs me. Bad thoughts crop up in the mind at night. Go and sleep. - Stay awake. I'll come back if i can't sleep. Where are you going, sultan? We'll come along. 'You can dress up like sultan mirza but can't be one.' Come in. You're the enemy. Your friend has raised his hand on you... ...and i'm extending mine. Don't think, take a seat. Sultan is scared of your progress. He knows you'll pave your own way. That's why he wants to suppress you... ...instead of encouraging you. He's afraid of changes. But... if we've to move ahead... ...we'll have to get sultan out of the way. The decision is yours. Remember... those who don't keep pace with time... ...lose the opportunity. Sultan's death will be just as grand. Tomorrow's his rally. But there won't be any commotion... ...just mourning silence. But remember... if sultan survives we'll be dead. What's wrong, dear? He's gone to kill sultan. Do something, stop him. I'm scared. Go home, i'll do something. The government also indulged in illegal activities... ...when you thought of entering politics. By letting you enter. Agnel sir, when we can be friends... ...then why take up enmity. Now i've befriended the government as well. If you don't stop your illegal activities... ...then your new friend will make you pay dearly. A man doesn't do bad deeds... ...to make the situations worse, but to make it better. And you will certainly notice a change in your circumstances. There will be water for everyone and food to eat. You mean everyone should resort to illegal means... ...to make his condition better? Sir... someone has to become sultan mirza... ...so that not everyone resorts to illegal means. By helping some people you think you've become a messiah. Our party has chosen one of your sympathisers. And he is... sultan mirza. Glory to... - sultan mirza! Glory to... - sultan mirza! Glory to... - sultan mirza! Glory to... - sultan mirza! Glory to... - sultan mirza! Glory to... - sultan mirza! As a child whenever i would hear such addresses... ...i would feel like pelting stones at the minister. Glory to... - sultan mirza! The rich never gathered hearing these loudspeakers. It draws only the poor. Thinking that today someone will say something of their interest. But nothing happened until today. People kept silent after finishing their speeches... ...and we kept screaming. Agnel sir. They're going to kill sultan. - What? Glory to... - sultan mirza! Who? - Shoaib. Sultan won't step down we will have to stop shoaib. Shoaib, stand near the desk and keep your eyes open. Take your men and come from behind. Independence was only for the rich. The rest are still slaves. Earlier it was the british... and now its poverty. Glory to... - sultan mirza! Glory to... - sultan mirza! Glory to... - sultan mirza! Leave me. Not every book makes it to the library. Some are found at the old-paper mart as well. We're like those books. Who else is with you? Tell me. - There's one more. Come on. Till today you came up to me... ...when everyone turned you down. Neither the police nor the government. And then approached me. But now... you can approach me first. Mother, i want a pistol. - There's one at home. Mother, i want that one. I'm only changing my way of tackling things... ...but not my attitude. Glory to... - sultan mirza! Seal the place. Who is with you? We found the two. Now it is safe. Not until shoaib is there, both are caught. Plan failed. I came here for myself... ...but now i won't rest until your dreams aren't fulfilled. Glory to... - sultan mirza! I'll take your leave. Not like this, sultan. Call rihana upstage. - Yes. Rihana. Rihana. Ambulance. Ambulance. Please, someone call the ambulance. Call the ambulance. Call... today mumbai is ruined. The same mumbai that was sultan's darling... ...which shoaib wanted to control... ...and i... wanted to protect. It's easy to choose between the wrong and the right. But equally difficult to choose... ...between two wrong people. And that's where i lost. The mafia alone isn't responsible... ...for making shoaib. The police is equally at fault. And 18 years later... ...it's difficult to lay a hand on him anymore. Though he's no longer in india... ...but he rules mumbai.
