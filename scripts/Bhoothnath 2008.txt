Banku wiII stay here, forever. You peopIe can``t Ieave this pIace. No. You peopIe can``t go. Is he stiII here? So, where is he right now? KaiIash Nath used to Iove his son. He offered many prayers for him in this tempIe. Now he has got attached to your son. Priest, that``s what we are fearing that.. ..what if he does anything to Banku.. Oh no, no. KaiIash has never caused anyone any harm. He won``t do anything. Then what.. what shouId we do now? Post death ceremony. We wiII have to do it for his souI to rest in peace. But onIy his son can do that. Yes. He shouId be the one to do it. Anyway this rite hasn``t been performed.. ..after KaiIash``s death. Who wouId have done it? His son was abroad. WeII, I have heard that he is here these days. Then I wiII meet and taIk to him. Ah.. If you heed my advice then your son.. ..can give KaiIash his saIvation. God answers to chiIdren``s prayers. God wiII sureIy accept his prayers. Vijay.. Aditya. - Hi. I aIways come here when I come to Goa. You come to Goa but you don``t go home. You stay there. And you want to throw us out of there. I am bringing down KaiIash ViIIa. This time I wiII seII the Iand and Ieave Goa forever. No house, no ghost. Not ghost but a spirit. A disgruntIed spirit of your father. DisgruntIed? Dissatisfied. Father has aIways been dissatisfied with me. He couId never understand me. Or perhaps you couId never understand him. Vijay, your father is attached to that house. He doesn``t want the house fuII of.. ..your mother``s memories to be demoIished. Perhaps that``s why his souI has stiII been wandering. Look Aditya, I don``t beIieve in aII this. And I find it reaIIy funny that.. ..my father``s souI troubIes everyone other than me. Doesn``t troubIe, just gives a sense of his presence. You know a Iot about my father. The day you were Ieaving the house.. ..your father went after his son to stop him. And he sIipped and feII down and maybe.. ..maybe even screamed. But his son didn``t turn around and Iooked at him even once. That was an accident! - That``s what you think. What do you want to say? I kiIIed my father? You don``t know anything. I was not wrong. He couIdn``t even understand such a smaII thing that I.. Now you aren``t abIe to understand such a smaII thing! Vijay. Vijay, aII you need to do is apoIogise. That too from your father. Just come home and apoIogise to him once. Maybe his souI wiII rest in peace. You have come to teII me what I shouId do? No, I have come to inform you that we have kept.. ..veneration so that your father``s souI rests in peace. We are.. performing a post death ceremony. Post death ceremonies aren``t performed in America.. ..but peopIe stiII attain saIvation. A son performs this rite for his father. Hey, so you do it. Prayer veneration and aII. Do as you pIease. I am coming to take the house keys the next day. Okay, I wiII sureIy keep some offerings for you. Anyway Vijay, even I didn``t beIieve in aII these things. But I agree that some things are aIways Ieft incompIete. This veneration too wiII be incompIete without you. Tomorrow, we are keeping a smaII.. ..veneration for your Bhootnath. ReaIIy? Is it his birthday? For his rebirth, for his.. saIvation. SaIvation, what``s that? Come here, Banku. Look, Iike you have gone from grade one to grade two.. ..simiIarIy with this veneration your Bhootnath.. ..wiII become a star angeI from and ordinary one. Star angeI! I wiII just go and inform him. Hey, Banku.. Banku! Bhootnath, you know I am keeping.. ..veneration for your saIvation. SaIvation? Yes. Like I went from grade one to grade two simiIarIy.. ..you wiII become a star angeI from and ordinary one. Just Iike my grandpa. Look there. - Let me Iook. Let me Iook at you to my heart``s content. I don``t know whether I wiII be abIe to meet you again or not. Why? You too wiII Iook at me Iike grandpa does, won``t you? I wiII. I wiII onIy be watching you. Promise me that you too wiII Iook at me everyday. Promise. But what if the cIouds come? Not even God can come between us. Promise me that you wiII never troubIe your mother. If she doesn``t give me an ice cream then I wiII. Promise me that you wiII never Ieave your parents. So many promises that too at one go? Bhootnath, you wiII just get saIvation.. ..you won``t be going anywhere. Okay, but the Iast.. Promise me that you wiII never fight with anyone.. ..and you wiII aIways forgive everyone. I wiII not forgive anyone. - No, it``s necessary to forgive. Like dirty cIothes become cIean after a wash.. ..your heart becomes cIear by asking for forgiveness. Then why didn``t you forgive your son? Why do you carry the burden.. ..of anger in your heart? The one who forgives his enemy.. ..is the one who attains knowIedge and saIvation. Time passes by. The day sets in and the night foIIows. When a smaII Iamp shines in the dark night.. ..though smaII, the oId traveIIer uses its Iight to toddIe ahead. Time passes by. The day sets in and the night foIIows. When a smaII Iamp shines in the dark night.. ..though smaII, the oId traveIIer uses its Iight to toddIe ahead. Time passes by. The day sets in and the night foIIows. WhiIe Ieaving I reaIized who is a near one.. ..and who is a stranger. WhiIe Ieaving I reaIized who is a near one.. ..and who is a stranger. You are the onIy one who is my own. You are the one who Ioved me. ``I can forfeit Iust, angry, attachments.`` ``I can never forget you even if I want to.`` ``Your Iove is bondage.`` ``TeII me, can I ever attain saIvation?`` You don``t know what you are for me now. How my heart meIts when I Iook at you! Time passes by. The day sets in and the night foIIows. I was sIeeping during the day.. ..woke up when the night came. I was sIeeping then. I was sIeeping during the day.. ..woke up when the night came. I was sIeeping then. Now why do you Iook for the sun.. ..you siIIy, the sun has aIready set. The age oId river of Iove has aIready fIown away. Why do you care for it now? Time passes by. The day sets in and the night foIIows. When a smaII Iamp shines in the dark night.. ..though smaII, the oId traveIIer uses its Iight to toddIe ahead. Time passes by. The day sets in and the night foIIows. Say your name. - I am Vijay Nath. Your cIan? - Kashyap. I am praying for my father``s saIvation. I am praying for my father Mr. KaiIash Nath``s saIvation. What do I know, what is saIvation? Don``t use this excuse with me. You taught me how to Iive. Now don``t Ieave me aIone Iike this. - Bhootnath. Papa, where``s my Bhootnath? Your Bhootnath got.. saIvation, son. But.. you said that.. we are praying for his birthday. He went away. He went away. You were right; some things are aIways Ieft incompIete. I couId never teII father.. I am sorry, son. I am sorry that your Bhootnath Ieft because of us. TeII him that this house wiII stay.. ..and it``s yours from today and teII him.. to forgive me. The sky is fuII of stars and.. ..my eyes are fuII of tears. Where are you hiding, give me a cIue at Ieast. Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Bhootnath! - My angeI! Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Bhootnath! Come down! Bhootnath! Bhootnath! I can break free from Iife but not from your Iove. I wiII come in front of you whenever you caII for me. But don``t teII this to anyone. - okay. - Okay? Come here. You too don``t teII anyone about this. Hey, Iisten up, my buddy. Let``s have some fun. A IittIe mischief, a IittIe deviIry. Something fishy. Hey, Iisten up, my buddy. Let``s have some fun. A IittIe mischief, a IittIe deviIry. Something fishy. Nobody does it better! No, no, no, no, no, no. Nobody does it better! Nobody does it better! No, no, no, no, no, no. Nobody does it better! You are with me, then every moment, day and night. The magic is with me.. teII me, isn``t it?
