Especially because after what he did to me I love my dad. I mean, I really did loved my dad. After the divorce, I didn't want to see him. I don't want to hurt my mom. most people don't get that. But if they did what I have He will understand. I was looking for the court house. I just hate to see them fight... but I still did not know how to stop it. Aunt May! - Hi, sweetheart. Hi! - Hi! How are you, doing DJ?..How are you doing? - I'm okay. Momma, look. McPherson. - Yeah Did you hear they bought the state bank? - Yeah Why they didn't just call that damn place "McPherson Ville?"

This type of child custody case is extremely emotional ... especially when charges of physical abuse ... are made by one of the parent. To this court,the welfare of this children is paramount. This case has made even more difficult by the refusal of Mrs. McPherson refusal to have her son testify. Please remove the children from the court room. Take them out. Everything will be okay. Testing shows the boy is under duress ... but he evaded the questions about his father. Attendent Emergency rooms and medical staff ... are required by law to report suspicious injurie.
