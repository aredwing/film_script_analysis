You have no idea what fun they can be. They always begin like games. Why avoid them? The Scarlet Letter HAN Suk-gyu LEE Eun-joo SUNG Hyun-ah UHM Ji-won Written and Directed by Daniel H. BYUN Shush! Shut up for 8 seconds. You know what Pace means? Peace! Huh? God, give us peace! Dead with a smashed head? That's no peaceful way to die. Are you in peace? Wow, On this great day huh? Think I'm in peace on my way to see a smashed head? By the same token, whoever smashed his head wouldn't be in peace either. Fuck! - HAN Studio... - Captain. Found any clues? - Good morning Captain. - Hey. - Captain - Huh? - Its this way - Okay It's only been a few hours. The body is still stiff. A murder weapon? Something hard like a brick. - Did you look for it? - It's gone. - You sure? - Sir? - When I got... - Take a note. Okay. "A murder weapon rarely leaves the crime scene. " I will find some uniforms to search the area. Tell them to pay extra attention to trashcans and manholes. AHN, who found the body? His wife. Should I sit there? Did you kill your husband? Taking the fifth won't do you any good. When I got back, I found him on the floor. - Where did you go? - The market. What did you buy? Didn't you go to the market... to buy things? - Some bean sprouts. - For how much? - 2 dollars. - You have a lover, don't you? Were you cheating on him? Never. You have a criminal record. March 1999, at the mall... I tried on a pair of shoes and I forgot to pay. I was gonna pay. But they didn't trust me. A cup of coffee? Shit. That's enough. Come sit. I'm out of aftershave. - Already? - Yeah You use it for body oil, or what? Damn, the deposit rate has dropped again. - Here. - Thanks The doctor's appointment is at 2 today, right? - It's tomorrow. - Huh? Wait. Come here. Hold still. Let me listen to my son. Purte He was our patron. A fine gentlemen. Any domestic problems? Did they have issues? They seemed fine. He was loaded... and wasn't a womanizer. They didn't have a child. Then again... A little bird told me he wasn't shooting blanks. What do you mean? She got so many abortions behind his back. That's what I heard. Yeon-shim? She's so clumsy! Get these gentlemen some snacks. She bought bean sprouts around 4 yesterday. - Do you remember? - Think hard. - I can't - She bought them from you. - Can't you remember? - I don't remember anything. - Leave me alone. - AHN! - AHN, that's enough. - Go away! Recoil. Recoil spring. Magazine, End, slide... Check! shit! What's the point? We hardly use it. CHO, you know what lured me into the police academy? This! Huh? Sig Sauer P-226. This was what. They sell these at the marts in America though. - Checked the insurance? - Yes. He bought a policy recently. - Life policy? - Yes, for half a million. - The beneficiary is his wife? - Bingo! This is almost too easy. It's so obvious. Take a note. 'They never smash heads like that just for money. ' These days... they cut fingers off for a few hundred bucks. - Aren't you writing it down? - Sure What about the wife? She helped her husband with the studio. She must be seeing someone. Check into it. Put one of our men on her. AHN is out there. Get your ass out too! Listen to the baby's heartbeat. Head, trunk, Feet... This is the spine. The baby is moving a lot. Fantastic! Looks like an alien. - Nurse? - Yes? Thank you very much Congratulations, Su-hyun. Here's the prescription. - Just a second. - Sure. - Did you see the baby on sonogram? - Yes When? Come on, tell me quickly. What? Okay. - Keep an eye on him. - Okay. This is the list of food to avoid during the pregnancy. You don't drink, do you? Another abortion isn't good. Take care of yourself. Excuse me! Who is it? Turn off the water, will you? It's leaking downstairs. Did you turn it off? Fuck! KIM Hyuk-ju! Shit. How much did you get? From whom? The lady from the studio! She'll pay you the rest later? You bought that? What the fuck! I didn't get anything! We have pictures, punk. Bullshit! You're writing a novel. Playing tough? - Look here. - Don't hit me! You're messing with the wrong guy. Whatever! You lay your hand on me again, and I'm so suing you. Listen. Didn't I tell you to make it quick... so we could eat? Four prior convictions. A month out of the joint... and you don't get it? Your prints were found at the crime scene. We have pictures of you taking money from her. Tell us how much she promised you... for killing her husband! Motherfucker! - Captain. - What? Any orders for me? What orders? This is no restaurant! Let's give it a change. Make it two-five time. Okay? These are all the unpicked-up ones in the period of one month. You can tell a lot from them. This one. This family took a trip for the first time in a while. I think it's the youngest taking pictures. Maybe this one. Her big brother must be on leave... from the army. This girl is... his girlfriend? She's not part of the family, considering she's dressed up... while the others have shorts on. I don't watch TV. - This is more fun. - Ms. JI Kyung-hee. Aren't you curious how your husband died? It was a heart attack. He appeared to have died due to the smashed head. But there's more to it. Had the impact affected the brain... an apnea would've resulted... As the right part of his head got smashed, the artery popped which led to hemorrhage. It seems that he tried hard to breathe, or kept spitting out words... for help. Not only was there blood on the floor, but his mouth to his lungs were filled with blood too. That caused the cardiac arrest. In other words, a heart attack. That's the cause of death. You don't find it interesting? Did you guys get along? We were okay. You're married, you must know. Problems are often overlooked... to keep the marriage together. How come no children? I'll call you back soon. I learned you'd had abortions. Quiet a few times. Why? How'd he find out? It's me. I told you I'd call you back. I'm busy tonight. Yes. Do I have to tell you? Yes. No, I'm not home. I'll call you back later. Bye. Who is your lover? What do you mean? You know KIM Hyuk-joo right? How much did you offer? Did you offer fair split? What is this all about? KIM Hyuk-soo confessed it all. What? He threaten me Ah, there must be somebody responsible for murder Are you always like this? Why did you give him the money then? My husband promised to do so. That money was mean to be his. Then you should've told so before. I did not want to be involved in a mess Well, investigations will tell the truth. If I have to go to the office I will. Will you... be easier to confess for your crime at the office? You're not doing your lover... any good by keeping quiet. Tell me. Have you ever hated your wife? No particular reason. You're just sick of her. I thought it would pass. For 5 years. But it never did. I'll get back to you. - Call. - I will. Not me. The lady you talked to earlier. She must be waiting... ...for your call. - Come in - Hello - Bean sprouts please. - For how much? - 2 dollars please. - Okay. Su-hyun. Most people put them in boiling water. But I do it differently. Over bean sprouts... I pour boiling water. This way they stay fresh. Here you go. Lets see It's a killer! Try it. - What you heard at the clinic... - What? I will get it. Hello? Hey, CHO. What's going on? I guess my cell phone is out of battery. We'll talk tomorrow. Bye, CHO. He... I'm sure he's innocent. He would come quite often. Once a week. Keep going. I think... He had a crush on me. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Sure. I was just testing my camera. You have my apology. It's okay. Why'd you take pictures of your feet? His feet? His own bare feet. The whole roll. I thought they were pretty. That was the beginning. Hands at first. Then the shoulders. Maybe... That's how he hits on girls. You know what? It's quite boring sitting alone at the studio. He started keeping me company... and I was glad. Even thankful. Thank you. Bye Bye! - What was it? - Me. - Who took these? - You told him? No, I couldn't. I have no idea why I'm in those pictures. That was the last roll from him. I was gonna develop them when my husband was gone. Kyung-hee, I love you Did he see this too? He got furious. What's going on here? Who the hell is he? Don't you know? They're from customers. It's the same goddamn jerk! What's wrong with you?! Why'd he take your picture? I don't know! I really don't! But he didn't believe me. When I got back from the market... - How do I look? - Gorgeous! Su-hyun. Look who's here! Ka-hee, it's been so long. - Hi. - Hi. You were fabulous. Here. Come on. Go ahead. You haven't changed a bit. Same old you from college. Look at Su-hyun. Who would think she's married? Once she becomes a mom, it'll be a different story. Gosh, are you expecting? Congratulations! That's really great. - Congratulations. - Thanks. One, Two, Three What's up, CHO? Amen! Sorry, Father. I have to take this call. - See you at church. - Sure. Bye. To you who are loved, and to myself who's become an intruder. Where are you? Five o'clock! - What do you say? - What? If a familiar song is heard when you don't expect it, you feel exhilarated like having an orgasm. Did I give you that tonight? I remembered. What? Do you remember when we went to the opening of this wine cafe? But it was under construction with nobody around. - It was then. - What? Hesitating whether to leave, we did it on the stairway. One side of the wall was glass. And you said... 'Having sex looking down at people outside,' 'It feels like doing the treadmill at the gym. ' I did? - It was that night. - What about it? I'm positive. When I got home that night, my cat cried hard into the night. Until dawn... What's your point? I'm 4 weeks pregnant. This is like a celebration party for me. Why follow me? Take your precious wife home. - What's going on? - What? That you're here. Why? I wasn't supposed to be? Don't forget. Su-hyun and I are friends. - Should I come with you? - Where? The hospital. I can't believe I got knocked up at this age. Silly me, huh? Should I keep it? What do you say? Some babies are blessed from the womb. And others have to fear... What do you want me to do? Nothing! Keep living happily with her as you have. I'm not a home wrecker! If I minded sharing you, I would've left you... when you decided to marry her. Stop it, God damn it! You think I'm happy? What is it you want? The baby? Keep it then! What is this?! Are you trying to screw me? - How long? - Sir? How long since the murder?! You know it's considered unsolved past a week's mark. Solve it within this week! - Hey, Captain Lee. - Sir? - You only have 3 days. - Okay. Get moving! JUNG Myung-sik is in Japan? Yes, the school confirmed... the seminar was set long ago. He's coming back tomorrow? Right, arriving at 10:40 Tomorrow morning... Captain. Yeah? Reporters are talking. We can't hold KIM Hyuk-ju forever. Release him. I don't wanna see you. Ka-hee... Let go! I'm showering. I got you something. - Ka-hee... - Let go! - Ka-hee, I am... - Let go! Let go! I'm sorry. Hands off, you bastard! Listen to me! How could you tell me to abort... Why'd you come to the concert? - I'm sorry. - Let Go! It's all my fault. I'M SORRY, okay?! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I love you, Ka-hee. - I love you. - I do too I love you too. You're all mine! I own you! - I love you. - I love you too. I love you so much. So much! I love you. I love you. I love you. Done. Left foot. Wish I had a son like you. To cut your toenails? Fine, I'll cut your toenails for the rest of your life. Sleep over. You come and go whenever you feel like. What's my place, a rest stop along the highway? And you don't pay me. - Money? How much do you want? - What? Your money is no good. What do you want then? - Leave your heart with me. - My heart? Give me your hand. Here. My heart. - Ki-hoon. - What? You need to gain weight. Are you sure you're a cop? You have no muscles. Don't rub it in! - Come on in. - No way! I'm cold. Wait up, Ka-hee. Do you love Su-hyun? I do. She loves me too. Are you sure? You think you know her well? She's not like us. "Us"? You think we're the same? She's just different. Have you interrogated her, Captain LEE? Assuming she loves you... because she fits into your life... Isn't it too dangerous? I'm not seeing you cause I have issues with her. While I see you, I do my best to her. You do? In what sense? Fucking me hard, and keeping a beautiful family with her? Then... Should I tell her? What? That you sound like a cat reaching an orgasm. That you like me from behind... Want some water? No thanks. Smoking right after sex? You're so bad. Su-hyun, sleeping? My Heart Hello? Yes? Captain! Yes, we picked him up at the airport. Yes. This picture. You took it, didn't you? It was found at the scene. And you left the country And you left the country on the same day. This belongs to my son who goes to primary school. He wrote it on the ground and asked me to shoot it for his girlfriend in class. And my trip was scheduled last semester. You took pictures of JI Kyung-hee. - Who? - The female owner of the studio! - You took her pictures. - No Don't play hard ball. You took her pictures! She asked me to. Cut the crap! She brought us pictures you took and told us everything. She asked me to! She was so serious I agreed. It wasn't porn. I took nude pictures of her. Is that a crime? Nude? You took nude pictures of her? So you're telling me JI Kyung-hee asked you to take pictures of her in the nude? Look, Detective. I have a family. Honestly, it's embarrassing... to even be here. Kyung-hee, right? I think she had a crush on me. I'm sorry. I was testing my camera. Why didn't you tell me? I could've been your model. Anything wrong? You memorized my name and phone number! Of course you come every week! Why'd you take pictures of your feet? Of all the pictures, she showed so much interest in my nude ones. Why'd you keep going back? You're a man. Put yourself in my shoes. She's pretty and mysterious. It's not a bad thing for a girl to be aggressive. So I kind of enjoyed it. You play at a concert hall, and I sing at a basement cafe. We've turned out so differently. - Tomato juice? - For her. Coffee is mine. Thanks. Why not drinking it? It's pretty good. Try it. You're seeing Ki-hoon lately? Change the subject. I've had enough. With what? - Ka-hee, please... - Please what? Tell me. You like the way you live? Didn't you tell me? Taking pictures frees your soul... ...like a little boy. Please. She said her husband was out of town and asked me to take pictures of her in the nude. I thought it was too much so I refused at first. Then again, I sometimes hire a professional model, and she was volunteering. So you did? Mind giving me one? Don't you like the thrill? I do. Getting there... is more fun than being there. Don't you have that experience? Fucking is good, but the feeling after you come... I didn't sleep with her. - Talk to me. - Yes Sir. It's true he was at the library. His library card confirms it. What if he lent it to someone? Keep digging for witnesses. And check out his wife too. - Yes Sir - Okay. What now? You know what? It's quite boring sitting alone at the studio. He started keeping me company... and I was glad. Even thankful. That was the beginning. Hands at first. Then the shoulders. What do you think it meant? Maybe... He wanted to sleep with me. Tell him about our rule. One more for the loser! - Cheers! - Cheers! Come on! You lost! One more shot! Sorry about that. Give it here. - Captain - What? Let me drink just beer. Shut up. You don't mix liquor. But once you do, you go all the way. Take a note! Whoever finishes last gets one more. - Okay - Sure. Ka-hee. It's me. Finger on the pad please, Try again please, Finger on the pad please, Try again please, What the... Ka-hee! It's me! Open the door! Ka-hee! It isn't easy for me either. I can't even buy you the ring you want so badly. Su-hyun got an abortion without me knowing. So open the goddamn door! Open it! It's me! - Su-hyun, I... - Please. I want a divorce. Gosh, you waited... for too long. I'm so sorry. Let me. I'm so sorry. Just so many customers! What kind of style... - Sister. - Yes? Where's Hyuk-ju? Who is... Where's Hyuk-ju? I don't know. I swear! Where can I find him? I really don't know. I miss him too! Name's OH Yeon-shim. They met at the bar. Hyuk-ju is crazy about her. Where can I find her? I'm not sure. I heard she works at a cafe called Purte. I met the studio owner through my boss. He offered to buy me... an apartment if I gave him a child. It wasn't killing a baby, but giving life to one. But Hyuk-ju completely lost it when I told him. I didn't get it. I'd be carrying the baby, not him! What the fuck... it seems there is nobody that she meets? What about the photos then? Kyung-hee I love you? I have all the evidences You fuck-head! Can't you do anything right? I was trying to be nice on you for Yeon-sim Shit-heads like you... and a hoe Yeon-sim, that bitch... you are all retarded assholes I met him later that day. Watching 'Kisses' on TV, he said out of the blue... I smashed his fucking head. Yeah... No... Didn't you used to run the show in the morning? I see. Thanks. Estimated time of death? The line is busy... Should we break up? God damn it! Let's eat out tonight. I'm getting off early. Let me have some of yours. Oh this! Shoes for our baby. They're pink. I think I want a girl now. I bought you a doll but... forgot to get it out of the trunk. You'll like it. Bye.

Bye. - Bye I'm selling the studio. I can't run it alone. I've left the force. I can't believe I put away the wrong guy. Then again, he's been in jail. He'll do just fine. Sorry I brought it up.
