He is to well known. I'll make sure to find the one we need. - It's ten o'clock. - Easy now, you'll make it. - It's knocking-off time, gentlemen. - Yeah, sure. One' with bread. We're closed. Will you hand him that sausage, okay? - Allright. - You're not from this city, are you? - No. - Where do you come from? - From Jutland. - What are you doing here? - Looking for work. - That thing with uh... - Okay, that's enough. What do you say about drinking a beer? It's on me. - Yes, please. Come. You understand, one can't stand living in such a little town. Nothing ever happens. I wanted to become an apprentice in carpentry but I could only get a job as delivery boy at an old sick idiot of a grocer. Three years as delivery boy, and no chance of doing anything else. No, thank you. I ran away, gathered some money. I thought it would be easier to find an apprenticeship here in the city. It wasn't. - Where do you live? - On the other side of South Harbour, something they call Klondyke. - Out there in the shanty houses? What a goddamn place. I once knew a girl out there. That was some terrible old barns to live in. We were wading in rats, but she was damn fine. You know what she did? - Allright, take it easy, will you? How did you end up there? - I met an old alcoholic. He lived out there. It's always better than the stairways. - What are your plans now? - I don't know. I'm beginning to get tired of it all. - How old are you, by the way? - Why is that? - No reason. - Seventeen. - That's great. Then we.. - Will you shut up, goddammit. Maybe I could find you something... Something that'll make you lots of green. Ingeborg, we're paying! Six beers. Four. Someone already paid for that guy there. - Me? - Yes, that genteman over there. - Why did he pay for me? - He's got the hots for you. You're just the type. - What the hell do you mean with that? - Calm down, fella'. Most of the people who come here are like that. Well, let's buzz off. Now that's something. - Yeah, it's a harsh one. How are you getting home? - He'll swim. - You can come along with me. I live just around the corner. - Thank you, but... - My old people are in the hospital, there's plenty of room. It's stupid to go all the way out there, man. Just come on. - Allright, thank you. - Bye bye, see you. I live with my sister. If you hear someone locking themselves in, it's her. She's out with some punter. Will you be allright with that thing? - Yes, thanks. - Well, see you tomorrow. - That was somehing, huh? - Yes, it's like that every night. Make yourself comfortable in the living room, then I'll bring some beer. - Rosa... How about we go into your room? Who are you? - I'm Anton. I was allowed to sleep her tonight. - Well, why not? If you want coffee you can take it in the kitchen yourself. - Here. - Thanks. - Are you from the country? - Yes. - I thought so. Why do you sleep here, don't you have a place to live? - I do, but it rained. - My God, what a weather. You should have seen me when I got home. I was completely soaked. There you go. What do you do? - Nothing yet. Looking for a job... - Why did you travel here? Didn't work with your old one? - Never knew him. No, it was more the place. - You think it's better here? - Well the chances must be better? I mean, in such a big city... I'd like to be an apprentice, as a carpenter. - Tell me, how long have you known Kaj? - I met him yesterday. He said he might be able to provide me something. - What kind of something? - Well, he didn't say, but it was something that made a lot of money. - You should probably just return home. - I can't do that. - Suit yourself. I warned you. - Against who? - Kaj, are you up? Well, I have to get going. I have to be at the factory eight o'clock. Take more if you want. - You be careful what you're doing, okay? You could easily get hurt. Come. So, what did you think now? - Now? But why, I thought... - That I would provide you with an apprentice place? You're not an idiot, right? You know there are many up for the bid. - Yes, there are many. - Many? Right, there are goddamn many. But you have connections, maybe? - No, but... - How long are planning to wait? - Well, I don't know. - So? What will it be? - But now that one wants to do it... - Let me ask you about it. Society...? It doesn't give a damn. It's rotten to the core. Making dough, on the other hand. Then you are something. Otherwise... I've got a trick. And we are three on it. Egon, mig... ...and you. And we'll split it straight up. Do you remember that guy, down in the joint yesterday? The one who paid your beer. - Yes? - There are plenty of that kind. And they only want youngsters they can find on streets and in bars. One can look at it as one likes. But we think it's a filthy goddamn thing. They could need to be taught a lesson. You see, us three... we go down to main square. And you turn on one of those guys, and take him with you home and then Egon and I slowly follow after you... - Tell me, are you out of your mind? What did you think of me? - Calm down, allright. Let me explain it first. He won't even touch you at all. Before anything happens, we'll be there. You just need to make sure the door is not locked. - And then what? - And then what? Well, then he'll show you the green before you've even said a word. They are afraid, you understand. The whole trick is that you are under eighteen. If the police find out, then he'll be punished. He'll shut up so he won't be outed, don't worry. So... what do you say? - It's really filthy. - They could just stop doing it. You could try. I tell you there's a lot of dough to be made. And you have to get money somehow... Think about it. Cheers, Anton! Listen, you need another one. Ingeborg! As I said before... one must learn to adapt. - Yes, what do you think I was before meeting Kaj, huh? On my way down there, buddy. I tell you, Kaj he understands. Cheers, buddy. - Cheers. Go over there and tap him to say hi. Follow that car. How did you get him to do it? - It's always easier when people can't take the strain, right? - Do you think he'll handle it? - He has got to. But no trouble, buddy. We should try not to scare him. - Thank you sir, that'll be 66,- - Thank you. - Thank you. Come inside. Come on in now. Do you like music? I have got a great deal of records, if you want to hear something. Sherry? - Yes, please. - Pour something for yourself, I will be right back. But why, you haven't taken anything? There you go. Cheers. - That'll be enough! So? You are starting to collect minors, huh? We'll have to see if we can get you out of that habit then. - What is this? What do you want here? - Just take it easy and nothing will happen. But we still have to take care of our little brother here, right? And then we should get something for our inconvenience. Egon... - It's in order? - Everything's in order. - Okay, let's beat it. Thanks, darling. - Why don't we drink a toast for Anton? That was a good job, buddy. - Look happy, man. Three hundred strong ones for each, that's a damn good hourly wage. - It's a goddamn filth. - I'd be damned if it is. He learned his lesson, it'll be a good long time before he'll try that thing again. - Yes, society should thank us. We should be given a goddamn medal. - What's that? Where did you get that from? - Oh, that? That was something I found down at that guy's place. - You stupid moron... didn't I tell you to keep away from those kind of things? It's dangerous, man. They will bust you if they find that on you. And you're in the soup too if you try to sell it. Throw it in the harbour, bury it, just get rid of it. I'm beginning to get real' tired of you. Can't you ever get it to work, that head of yours? - Hello, darling. - Hello, flower. - Did you forget we were supposed to be together tonight? - I had to be able to afford it first, no? Well... See you. That was Rita, she's got the real hots for Kaj. Drink up, man. I'll buy another round. Ingeborg! What's that, you're not at work? - Kind off, but they're under construction at the factory. They've come to the department where I'll be going, they're making it larger and putting in more machines, so we're only working until twelve the next eight days. - That's great, huh? - They could have let us off work all together, but they are so darn anxious about their green. - To think that anyone bothers to work at all... - Well, what a lovely boy you are. Where is Anton? - He's out buying a new set of clothes. We're taking it next level, you see. He's slowly learning it. - So he'll keep on staying here? - That's right, I've sent him out to the alcoholic to get his stuff. Listen, you seem to be awfully interested, huh? - Yes, cause I think it's a pity for him. He's not your type at all. - No, but he will be. - Yes, you'll get him down in the dirt soon enough. It'll end up with him just like it did to Axel. - You shut up now. You know it wasn't my fault. - So? - I wasn't the one who snitched him. - It sure did suit you well. - That'll be enough! You better mind your own business, you understand? You're warned now. Skipper! - Skipper. What, who is it? - It's me, Anton. - Oh, is it you my boy? - You must be crazy to sit here and sleep. You could fall in, it's deep here, you see. I've just been here to get my suitcase. - Where have you been? It's been a while since a I saw you. - I've stayed at some folks in the city. - And new clothes, huh? - I've got some work. - Then maybe you have a little something to spare... - You bet I have. - What kind of work is this? - It's just something in the city. - It doesn't sound good. What kind of thing is it? - Don't be so curious, Skipper. It's all right. Well, I'm off. You take care of yourself okay? I'll come back some other day. You be careful what you do, my boy. They always get us in the end. Something of a place, huh? Come, you should meet aunty. He's real fun. - Hello, aunty. - Hello, hello. - This is my friend, Anton. - He's real cute, huh? What do you want, port wine? - Yes, that'll be allright. Hand us two large ones, okay? - I will get you that. Tell me, you haven't dumped Kaj or something? - Kaj? No... we're meeting him in just minute. - I see... - Cheers, buddy. - Hello. Yes, he's here. Yes, I will do that. Yes... yes, okay. Good bye. There's telephone for you. Here's the address. If it isn't the velvet boy. - And? - How's it going? - Fine. - Don't you want a glass of something? - Some other time, buddy. Business... - There's Kaj. - Did you order something for me? - No, not yet. - Then drink up and come with me over here. Someone's waiting to buy a couple of rounds there. - No one's like Kaj to take care of that of thing. Hey. - So, it's you? - What are you standing around here glancing for anyway? - Oh, I'm just amusing myself. - You know... I've been thinking about something. They're under construction out in the factory, and there's a carpenter there, a real funny ol' guy. What if I asked him if he could provide you with something? - Be my guest. It doesn't work. - One could always try. You got new shoes. - Yes. - They're good looking. Must have been expensive, huh? - Nah... it wasn't that bad actually. Are you on your way home? - Yes. - Then we can make company. What was that? - It's for Anton. I'll be damned, it's from a bitch! "My de-ar Anton" "it... is..." - Oh, come on. "My dear Anton," "it is evening, I'm sitting in my room" "and writing to you." "I miss you so." Oh really. "I'm so happy everything is working out for you." "I've been thinking about visiting you." - Now, what the hell is this? He never told anything about her. "Butcher Hansen is going to Copenhagen in the end of the week.." "and he told me I could come along in his car." "Write me, if you think I should do it." "Everything is so empty and sad without you." - Bullshit. - Oh, will you give it break. - There he is. Hey, Anton! - Yes, what is it? - Do you want a beer? - Sure, thanks. - Hey Rosa? That soldier who's been here before... - Oh, him. He's a real bore. - Anyway, he sure has a bad taste. - We're going out tonight. Welcome in. Let me turn on the light. We're going in there, you can go ahead. - Thank you. - The switch is on the right side. - Thanks. - Watch it, that's a valuable thing. Do you want a cigaret? Do you like turkish ones? They are in the box. - Yes, please. - No, thanks. I don't think... I'm not completely myself tonight. Take a seat if you want. - Thank you. - I've been to a grand dinner. That's why I went home to get some fresh air. What is your name? - Ove. - Ove, I had a brother by that name. Is your mother still alive? - Yes. - I lost my mother when I was in your age. She was the only one who understood me. Understood what it meant to... That contempt one has to face. People don't say anything, but one can see it in their eyes. I hate myself. Here, take these. And now go away. Keep out of this stuff. - Good evening. - What are you doing? - Ouch - Stop it! Stop it, god dammit. - What's going on? Are you out of your mind? - That's enough. See what he's got in his pockets. - A measly fifty kroner. How about we take some things with us? - No, it's too dangerous. Pull yourself together now, idiot. - What about that guy? - He'll be allright. - This ain't something to split, how about we go out and blast them on drinks, huh? - I'm going home. - Wimp. You already came home? - Turn off that light. - Where are the others? What's wrong? - Nothing. - Something happened? It's something about Kaj, right? You're bleeding. - It's nothing. - Come, sit down here. Did he hit you? Why don't you go home? It's not something for you this place. I know Kaj. It ends up bad. - And so what? - Anton, you're too good for that. I don't mess with what it is you're messing around with, I just know when Kaj's in it, it's not any good. Anton, be careful. Don't waste yourself. You want to become a carpenter, find a job... I could see it on you out there on the building site, you want to learn something. - What good is it, nobody needs me. - Don't say that, it's not true. Don't you understand I've come to like you? Anton, for me... Anton? Anton, I've got news you. I talked with that old carpenter today, and he said he might be able to use you, you just needed to... Kaj? - What was that he just needed to? - Nothing. - You're not trying to make any tricks, are you? Now let me tell you some thing... you can go to bed with him, as much as you like, but this other thing, that's none of your business, and if you tell Anton anything at all about that place then I won't answer to what will happen. By the way, I have to thank you for helping I was just starting to think, I'd have to give up on him. but now he's staying. Good job, buddy. We'll get him used to spending those money eventually, won't we? - You low, filthy rat. - If you try anything at all concerning Anton, I'll bash your pretty little face in, so you won't recognize it. Hello, boys. So, what are you having? - Schnaps. - Yes, double. - Are you paying? - No, Anton's paying. - How did it go with the pool coupon? - Can you believe it? It was a bummer. Not a single one came right. And I even got help from a football player. A handsome young man. - Don't you want one? - Oh no, my doctor told me to stay away from booze and women. - Cheers, buddy. You wanna play dice for the next one? - Sure, let's do that. Do you want to join? - No, not now. - Then let's get the velvet boy with us, he sure needs to lose. - Yeah, okay. - Kaj, there's something I need to talk to about. - Not now, I have to see the others. Later, buddy. Take a schnaps, it's on me. Moster! A double for Anton. He's getting weirder all the time. - Yes... But we got him in a tight spot. He's been in it too long now. - So, who's starting? The cops are coming. Shall we cut and run? - No, it's too dangerous. Good evening, Jarne. We need to talk to you. You know what it's about. Look at that one at the bar. - The one with the quilted jacket? - Yes, he looks a bit too young. It's the police, come with us outside for a moment. - Me? Why is that? - We just need to talk a bit. Just come on. Dammit. - He'll rat on us anyway, the old one. - No, then we would've been taken along too. - Then what? - I don't know. How old are you? Are you eighteen yet? - No. - What's your name? - Anton Hansen. - Do you have a job? - No, not at the time. - Do you have any ID on you? - No...? - We better take him with us. But you threatened him to hand out the money? - Yes. - How many? - A few grand. - Mr. Nielsen says it's a question of 4.600. What did you know about him? - Well... he had Little-Svend with him home a couple of times. - How old is Little-Svend? - Sixteen. - And Mr. Nielsen knew that already? - Yes. - It says in the files from your first case that Mr. Nielsen was among the men you had been together with when you were fifteen or sixteen years old. - Well, that's why he was so easy to threaten. - When is the last time you had a job? - A couple of years ago. - Well then, that's all. Can you approve the report? - I guess I have too. - Then sign here. Sit him down and let me get the file on Anton Hansen. show that YOU will give way Will you finish it? - Yes. ARRESTEES Here you go. Please sit down. You name is Anton Hansen? When were you born? - 4th of august 1930. - Not yet eighteen then. Do you have a permanent residency? - Nikolajgade 5, first floor. - Who do you live with? - Some of my friends. Kaj and Rosa Jensen. - How long have you been town? - A couple of weeks, at the most. - Let's see what you've got in your pockets. Thanks. Seventy kroner... Where did you get those from? - I uh... got them with me from back home. - Well, the address looks true. But they were sent the 17th., that's almost three weeks ago, and you only lived there two? - Then... it must have been three. - Can you tell me who sent this letter? - My mother did. - We found you in the sex bar. Do you know what kind of place that is? - No. - Not at all? - Well, maybe. - How often have you come there? - One or two-three times. - That's not true. We believe, that you have had something to do with those men. - I haven't. Tell me, do you have something on him? - It's the first time we see him. - Well... we'll have to let him go then. Let me tell you something. You better stay away from that place. It's bad company for you. We know those guys hanging out there... it goes wrong for most of them. They become tough and disinclined to work and many of them end up as criminals. You better find some work as fast as possible. If we meet you again, you won't get away as easy as this time. We know you now! Half past nine. I'm going to Riktor's place. I'm too afraid to leave before he gets back. - Do you think he'll rat on us? - No, not Anton. He probably need to give up on living here though. - So what? They can't force him not to. It's him. - No god dammit, he's got his own key. - Then who is it? - Go and have a look. Good morning, I'm sorry to come by this early, but I would like to talk to Anton Hansen. - He's not home. - Oh, did he go out? Then I assume it will take a while before he gets back? - No no, he's just out fixing something... - Can I wait for him here? - Sure, be our guest. - I have to tell you I came all the way from Jutland. - Yeah yeah, that's great. - What's that? - Good morning. - She's an acquaintance of Anton's. She'd like to wait for him here. - Here? It could darn take a while before he's coming. We can tell him you've been here. - Yes, but what am I to do... I don't know anyone in this city. - Oh come on, Kaj. She can come in and get a pilsner. - Egon... Welcome in. There will be no more for me, as of now. I don't want to be in it any more. Else? Are you here? - I wrote that to you. Why didn't you answer my letter? - Your letter? - Yes, that's why I decided to come anyway. - Where do you live? - No place yet. I thought you would know that kind of thing. - There's a small hotel down the street. Let me follow you there. Do you have more luggage than this one? - No. Good bye. - Anton! Shut the door. Did they get anything out of you? - Well, I had to give them the address to this place. - Nothing else? - No. - I think I have to give you a little warning. All this boloney about you quitting and not wanting to be in it any more... ...it's no good. - I'll decide for myself, damn it. - Oh, really? Now let me tell you something, my dear friend. You're up to the neck in dirt. What if Egon and I told a thing or two to that piece outside, huh? Other people could be interested too. Your mother for example. Else Nielsen. I see. Number 23, up the stairs and take a right. Can you believe it, I'm here in Copenhagen. How good looking you've become. I can almost not recognize you. How wonderful it is everything is working out for you. - How long will you stay? - Well, at first I had thought about a couple of days... but if I tried to get a job over here, we would be able to see each some more. Du haven't told me what it is you're working with, by the way. - It's an evening job. - You're off in day time then? - Yes. - Then you can show me the city. Oh, how excited I am! I can't believe it, I thought she was much bigger. - Come. [PASSPORT] Come! Let's sit here so we can look outside. Oh! Just what I needed. Good day, we would like to get a couple of smrrebrd. - Yes, with pleasure. - Oh, how wonderful time we're having. At which time are going to work tonight? - Don't think about that. I've taken a couple of days off. - Here you go. - Thank you. - What do you want? Oh, how wonderful city this is. And everyone looks so kind. - It's good you came, Else. Where are the others? - Went. They were tired of waiting. Where have you been? - Here and there. - Else, is that her name? - Yes. - You haven't told me anything about her. - I didn't know she was coming. - You tell me. - I've known her for many years, we were in the school. - Oh, how touching! Anton... will it be her or me? - That's not something to ask about. - Don't, I want you to answer me! - Damn it, I don't know! - Well, straighten up and find out! Because if it's me, Anton, it'll only be me. - Didn't you bring Anton with you? - No. - One more beer. - Two. - Yes. - He's really something, now we haven't seen him for several days. - He'll come when he needs the money. - You bet, it was just starting to work. - As long as he doesn't skip off. - Go back home? - Right! You don't know what she's up to. - Do you think she knows what he's doing? - She knows shit. - How about we use Rosa to mess things up a bit? She's real jealous on that suburban slag. - She doesn't want to. I've tried, I don't know what's up with her. - Rita! What about Rita? - Me? She doesn't know me. - Oh, right. - But she doesn't know Rosa either. - Yeah, and so what? - So what? Let me tell you... - I'll see you again. - In an hour or so, I've just got something I need to take care of. - Well, good bye then. Hurry up and get back. Oh Anton, I'm so happy. There's a young lady waiting for you. Good evening, you wanted to talk to me? - Well, you see, it's out now. Why don't we go to your room? - Okay. - My name is Rosa, I'm Kaj's sister. That one Anton lives with. - What is this about? - It's something about Anton... - Oh. I think it was a mighty scam. Damn it, there he is! - What did I tell you... Get lost, we need to talk with Anton. Hi there, Anton. - Can you borrow me some money? - Maybe... So, you've thought a little about it, huh? - You'll get them back as soon as I've gotten a job. - Ah, it's like that. I was just about to think you had pulled yourself together. - You don't want to then? - Go to hell. Moster! Two schnaps. - What now? - He'll come... Just wait... He'll come. Hello there! Wait a minute... - What is it? - The young lade just left. - Left? - Yes, she came with her suitcase and told me to get a cab for central station She would try to catch a train that left 22.15 Else! Why are you leaving? - You've been lying to me, Rosa has told me everything... - Rosa? - Yes, all that with her and all that other stuff. It's so dirty everything. - Else, you have to listen to me. - No! There's nothing more to talk about. I'm going home. Oh, I so believed you Anton. How could you? Are you rotten to the core every single one of you? Don't try to write me, I'll burn your letters. And now go! Go back to Rosa and all your friends... A double! - The others are sitting over there. - One more. - So? You came after all, huh? - There's a guy over there. - You don't have courage tonight, or? - Car dealer, dog drunk, this kind of wallet. - What do you say? - Where is he? - Oh hell... he's leaving now! - Come, fast. Catch him outside. We'll leave through the back door. There he is. - We're going to Trngade! - Trngade, yes sir. - Damn! - What the hell should we do? - We have to try down on main street. - Isn't that a cab over there? - It is! Come. You can hang your jacket there. Come on. I don't see that many stairways. We just have to take one side each and find the door that's not locked. Hurry up a bit! Here. There should be an opener on the table. - I can't see any. So, you're trying to pull tricks? You better not, my friend! I know that dirty trick, but you're not going to fool me. What happened? - I killed him. - Say what? - Did anyone see you? - No. What should I do? - Get lost and shut up! You understand, the two of us... we don't know anything about this thing, we're not going to be messed up in anything, you understand!? - But... - Now get lost! Scram! Do you think it was up there he came from? God dammit, there must be something to get... Are you coming? - Are you mad... I'm leaving.
