What did y'all do? They broke into my house... ...and broke my VCR trying to steal something. I want my money. That's why I brought them. These are not my kids. You know what? -Take them to my mama. -Hold the hell on. They ain't seen your mama in four days. -That's not like her. Where is she? -They don't know. Hell, why I'm supposed to know? I don't know. I don't know her. Okay, my sister is dead. Their mama, she dead. And so my mother is raising them... ...and that's who you should talk to to get your money. If she ain't there, you better get me the $300 and get my VCR. That's all I'm telling you. I'm telling you I don't have $300, and these ain't my kids. Let me explain something to you. If you don't give me my money... ...I'm calling the po-po on all three of these thugs. You can use my phone. Help us, Aunt April. We tried to find Grandma. What if I bring them over to your house... ...and they can work the money off? -Work it off? Hell, no. -Clean up? -What do you mean "what"? -No, no. I want my $300. You gonna bring them to work for me? You can't bring them to my house to do nothing. I got a white woman next door to me and I have a dog. You know what that mean? I don't wanna let O.J. and Michael Vick at my house. Well, I don't know what to tell you, because I don't have-- Fine. Fine. Make sure they be over at my house. That thing ain't even worth-- Say something else. I want you to say something-- Say-- Snatch away from me, I'm gonna punch you like I dude. Say something. Come in here. Little O.J., that thug and Sister Souljah, she know where I live. -Make sure they be at my house. -Yeah. Where is your grandmother? -We don't know. -Y'all can't stay here. Okay, I got a man, and he don't like kids. So y'all gonna have to figure something else out. All right, y'all can't stay here. So where is she? You can't smoke around him. He has asthma. Girl, this is my house. You can wait outside. -Fine, then. We will. -Good. Wait, we ain't been to sleep all night. I'm tired. Well, y'all can stay here, but I'm out. Get up out of here with that attitude. Come on. Get to stepping. -Hey, look, I'll see y'all later, okay? -All right. -Bye-bye. -Bye. Puffy and Biggie, y'all don't wanna go with Lil' Kim? -Nope, I'm going to sleep. -I'm going to bed. Y'all shut up. Don't make no noise. I gotta work tonight. Oh, okay. Good. Bless you. God bless you, and come again. Glad we could help. -Hi. -Hello. I am from Pastor Hector Romalle's church in Columbia. -You used to run missions there. -That was a long time ago. -What's your full name? -Sandino. Sandino Ramirez. You seemed to be doing so well there. What are you doing here? I've come to this country to find a better life. To find some work. Not having much luck. I remember you're here, I wanted to see if you could help me. Got any special skills? What is it that you do? I'm a handyman. We have some things around need to be fixed. Got plenty of tools, plenty of supplies. Don't have much pay, but we will pay you something. Stop! Come here! Stupid, come here! -Deacon, Deacon, stop that girl. -Hold on now. -Come here. -Let go of me. If I ever catch you in my store again-- Miller, Miller, I got it. I'm gonna take care of it. Hey, you'd better, pastor. -Young lady, are you on drugs? -No. Why? -Where are your parents? -I don't got no parents. Jennifer? -Miss Wilma. -You know this child? Yeah. That's Rose's granddaughter. She lives next door to me. Your grandmother's a member of this church. -Well, have you seen her? -Not in a while. -You don't know where she is? -No. -You staying with April? -No. Sister Wilma, take this man and show him where we're having a problem. Sandino, I'm gonna work on a place for you to stay. -Good seeing you again. -Thank you. Good to see you too. Okay! Bullsh-- Pastor. Hi, April. May we come in? -How are you, April? -Sleepy. And you? All the better for seeing you. What did she do now? She was caught stealing from the drugstore. Maybe she was hungry. Then why was she stealing needles? Oh, I don't know. Her mother died from drugs, so maybe she's following in her footsteps. -April. -This one right here. Come on, she's a kid. -You know where my brothers at? -Yeah, they out back. Go join them. -Glad to. -Get out of here with all that attitude. -I should've left you outside. -April. That's okay. Because when they find my mama, they're going back to her. -I ain't got time for these kids. -Look, April. -Your mother's getting older. -Yeah? Yeah, she can't raise these kids by herself. Every time I see her, she's looking weaker. These are my sister's kids, not mine. Yeah, but your daddy left you and your sister this house. -And? -You haven't done much. Nope. I left it just how my daddy left it. -It's falling apart, April. -I guess so. There's a handyman at the church today. Just listen. And he needed a place to stay. So maybe, maybe, in exchange for his work, you can let him stay here. That's if he does a good job at the church. That's a good idea, pastor, but-- -Time for me to go, huh? -Yeah. I gotta work tonight. I'm sleepy. -You still working at the club, April? -Six nights a week. -I'm praying for you, April. -Thank you, thank you so much. -Bye-bye. -Bye-bye. I'm gonna say my prayers for you before I go to sleep. -You do that, April. -Hallelujah. You know what? Oh, God. You don't hear knocking at this damn door? This ain't our house. -What? -Hi. I'm Sandino Ramirez. What do you want, man? I went by the church today. I spoke to Pastor Brian. He told me to go see you. What do you want? I fixed a few things at the church today and... ...well, the pastor told me to come see if you need something-- Anything fixed in your house. I can work for room and board. It's fine. Are you crazy? No, I'm not crazy. You crazy? I'm loco. Come on. Hello. Let me show you to the basement. You can sleep down here. I mean, I know it's not much, but it's warm. And there's a cot right there. Since I don't know you all that well... ...I'm gonna have to lock you down here in this basement. Wait a minute. What if there's a fire or something like that? You're a handyman, right? Break yourself out of here. Look, do you want it or not? Okay. And what about food? Come on. So you worried about food? I'm gonna leave a razor so you can shave that caveman look off. I'm not the one, you're it! I got it! Will y'all shut up down there? Shut up! So your name is Byron. Right? And what is your name? -I'm Manny. -Manny. Okay, Byron and Manny. May I ask your name? -Jennifer. -Jennifer. Okay. -Byron doesn't speak, huh? -No. That's okay. So, Byron, Manny, you guys wanna go out and play? -No. -Yeah. -Why not? -We don't know you like that. -Well, your mother's asleep. -That's not my mom, that's my aunt. Your mom or your aunt, she's asleep. Come on, let's go outside and play. Throw me the ball. Yeah, but I'm gonna come too, so I can keep an eye on you. Come on. Slam it again! I'll teach you how to play football. Manny, don't run like that. I'm thinking-- You got some moves, huh? Get ready for the moves. -You don't have anything on me, huh? -Manny, take it easy. Oh, I got you. Take it easy. I wanna be an athlete. It's gonna be okay. You okay? Byron, where's the ball? -Just behind the flowerpot. -Okay. -Manny. -Go ahead. Damn. You are fine. I knew it. You can't smoke around him. He's got asthma. You already said that. -What's wrong with you, Manny? -That thing can happen... ...when your mama's on crack when she's pregnant. The rate you're going, you're gonna end up like her. -You don't know about me. -I know you're stealing needles. The needles was for him. He's got diabetes too. -What don't you have? -Cancer. He's gonna need his insulin in the morning. -Well, where is it? -I dropped it. Brilliant. So, what happens if he doesn't take it? He dies. I gotta hurry up and find my mama. Y'all getting on my damn nerves. I'm home. What are these kids doing in this house? -Hi, baby. Hey. -Hey. What's going on? Those are my sister's kids. You've met them before. Look, my mother is MlA, okay? I was about to go there and find out what's going on. -I can't be handling all this. -I know. Just sit down. I'm gonna get you something to drink. And who the hell is this? -That's Sandino. He's renting a room. -Renting a room? You turn this into a bed and breakfast? No, the church sent him over to help me out around here. Just so he can have somewhere to stay. He needs a place to stay. Everybody needs a damn place to stay. What's up, Mexico? -You legal? -Stop. Leave him alone. Hey, he's a grown-ass man. He can answer the question. I said, you legal, Mexico, huh? Look at that. See right there. I know this boy ain't legal just by the way he looking down. Where are you going? -Take care of my business. -No, I don't think so. We're all going somewhere together in a moment. You don't tell me what to do. Hey, little girl, check your tone in your auntie's house. -Who are you? -Watch your mouth. I'm the one paying the bills up in here. That's who I am. Sit down. Sit down. You better stop rolling your eyes at me. I'll be back. I'm gonna go find my keys. What? Oh, you need to get by, huh? All right, then. Go on, then. So you think you grown, huh? I got something for little girls who think they're grown. I got something for grown men who think they got something for me. Got a fast one on my hands. I'll show you what I got. You're too grown to like chocolate? Come on, go ahead. Come on, baby, I know you want some. Go on, take it. I know you want some, little girl. I didn't ask you a damn thing, did l, boy? -Go sit down, Byron. -Sit your fat ass down. -You don't talk to him like that. -Oh, yes, ma'am.

Yes, bye. See you later. I breaks attitude with children like this. You heard of The Horse Whisperer? I'm the Kid Whisperer. Look, lady, you gonna tell us what you need us for, or what? -Talk to me like that one more time. -Quiet. This old woman don't play. She doesn't scare me. Look at her. -You better be scared. -I've been to jail. I will shank you, fool. You better not touch us again, or I'll call 911. What do you mean, "touch you again"? I ain't touched you yet. You gotta get to the phone if you're gonna dial 911. You got to get to the phone. I will hit you so hard that your cranium and your urethra tube... ...will all be tied up together inside of each other. You wouldn't be able to do nothing but pee and run. You don't know if I got a cell phone. You're gonna need surgery to get it from down your throat. -Whatever. -Say something again. Say one more thing, I will pimp-slap you. Say it again. That's what I thought. You're gonna come into this house and clean. And if anything come up missing in my house, I promise you... ...you're gonna come up missing. Come on.

I was just wondering... ...have you talked to your mother lately? Yeah, I went by the house earlier, she wasn't there. I don't know. I don't know where she is. You know, this is just-- It's not like her. No, it isn't. I don't know what to say. I was gonna come by there later on. Will you let me in? No, I can't do that, child. I let your sister in there one time. She stole everything your mama had. You should've known better than to let a crackhead in somebody's house. Well, I can't let you go in there. Your mama had such high hopes for you. Miss Wilma, is there anything else you need? Because I really have to get ready for my next set. No, that's it. -I'll see you later. -Okay. -Thank you. -God bless you. Alrighty. You're doing a good job cleaning, Manny and Byron. I don't know why you letting them children clean up anything up in here. You're gonna need a metal detectors when they leave up out of here. All right. -How the dishes coming? -Fine. Little girl, you got the nastiest attitude I ever did see. -Why are you so nasty? -Because. I'm about to come over there. Joe, you better get this girl. She just said "because" to me. You better watch it, girl. That's the heavyweight champion of the world. She took out Ali and Frazier and George Foreman. They all came here and she took them out. -That's why Foreman's selling grills. -Attitude like that... ...gonna be by yourself all your life. Nobody wanna be around that. Maybe I don't want nobody around. Yeah, Madea want flies around here. Every time she goes somewhere, flies be flying around her. Just funky. Maybe that backwards boy washing the soap. You get out of this life what you put in. You give good things... ...good things will come back most of the time. That ain't true. -I said most of the time, child. -Yeah, whatever. Girl, if you say "whatever" to me one more time... ...before the "wha" can get out of your mouth... ...I'm gonna be in the back of a police car. Sit down. Sit down. Know what happens to girls that are mad at the world? They become bitter old women if they don't figure out what's going on. Bitter old woman, just like the one you're talking to, a bitter old woman. A bitter 450-pound old woman. Oh, that's funny? At least you could smile. Did that hurt? Did it crack your face, Cruella? -I ain't got a whole lot to smile about. -Hush that up. Got a whole lot to smile about, you living. They got children your age in the hospital... ...strung out on HlV, drugs and everything else. You talking about you ain't got nothing to smile-- You pretty. Get you a mirror and see how pretty you are and smile at yourself. I'm not pretty. I mean, I ain't got nice clothes or nothing. Clothes don't make you pretty. They make you broke. You know what I want you to do? There ain't no mirror down here. When you get through cleaning that window... ...Iook at yourself and see how pretty you are. Go on and clean it real good until you see your smile: We wanna give it up for the Gap Band. Give it up for the Gap Band, ladies and gentlemen. That's not the original Gap Band. They just get their clothes from the Gap... ...so we call them the Gap Band. They sound good. Don't they sound good tonight? Look. She look good tonight. Gotta have a fix. Oh, my Lord. The church. We got a lady here from the church. And I'm telling you, this lady can sing. She can really sing. Ladies and gentlemen, now, the spirits say that if we make a lot of noise... ...she just may come up here and sing a song for us poor little sinners. -Come on up here, Miss Wilma. -No, don't do that. Oh, Miss Wilma don't mind. Come on up here, Miss Wilma. How are you doing tonight? -I'm doing fine, Freddie. -Good seeing you. -You look lovely. -Thank you very much. You gonna sing something for us tonight? Well, I'm always ready to give my testimony anytime, any-- Now, Miss Wilma, I don't mind you singing... ...but save all that testimony stuff for the church. Right now, we just want you to sing a little song... ...make the people feel good. What do you already know? You know what she's gonna sing. Hold this, Freddie. Don't steal nothing. Miss Wilma. Let's do it. I'd like to dedicate this to all you beautiful faces... ...but especially to April. Thank you. Y'all go straight in the house, you understand? Boy, don't be slamming my door. Hey, wait. Thank you. Hey, how was it? I don't wanna steal nothing else if that's what I gotta do to pay it back. That lady's crazy. That means all of your decisions, your choices... ...they all have a price to pay. So you do the crime, you gotta do the time. Yeah, whatever. Look, we ought to take a bath. Go on upstairs. Jennifer. What's this? You bought his insulin. I was gonna do it. Well, now you don't have to. Why are you so nice to us? -I don't understand that question. -You nice, why? Why not? You should expect people to be nice to you. You shouldn't expect people to be mean. Not in this world. -You get what you expect, right? -I guess. You do a great job with your brothers. I'm all they got. Oh, come on. What the hell is Mexico up to? Are you serious? Hey. What--? Do you know what time it is? -Yeah, it's 1:30 in the afternoon. -What are you doing? -I'm working off my debt. -What? I figured that I'd get up this morning, get to work. Figured if I fixed this floor, then the kids can stay in this room. You don't have to worry about those kids. They're not staying, pack up your tools and go back down in the basement. Why not? Why they don't stay in here? What do you mean--? Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it! Look, you have a serious problem with this floor, okay? I know that. That's why no one ever comes up here... ...and that's why I keep the door closed. For safety, okay? These kids, they need a room of their own. Why are you so worried about kids that don't even belong to you? -What's up? -That's your family. Why you not concerned? Jennifer has nightmares every night. Manny, night sweats. Byron, he tosses and turns in his sleep. Can you imagine what those kids have been through? I just wanna help them. You wanna help them? You live in my basement. You can't even help yourself. How are you gonna help? -By giving them this room. -No, no, you're not. This is my house. You can't give them nothing that doesn't belong to you. If you're so worried about the kids, why are you making so much noise? -You're waking them up. -They were gone before I got up. Well, where did they go? Since you know so much about them. I don't know. What do you care? You don't even make them comfortable to stay here. That's right, three less things I gotta worry about. Pack up your little tools and follow me back down to the basement, come on. -You know, you don't-- -Let's go. You don't even mean that. You don't know me. -Let's go, back to your blind spot. -Hey. These kids need someone. They need some help. Okay, well, when my mama comes back... ...she will come and get them, and they will have someone, happy? You're not this heartless, April. So why do you do this? Is it because of your man? Is it because of him? You know, you're too good for him. Please, Sandino, stop it. Okay, I'll finish up after your man wakes up. Thank you. I'm coming. Shoot. Pastor. Miss Wilma. What are you guys doing here? -Hi, April. -Hi. Can we come in? -Hello. -Hey, you clean up nice. Thank you. -Getting any work done around here? -Yeah, as much as she'll let me. Great job in the chapel. We even have a check for you. Well, that's great. I'll come by to pick it up. Hello? Is that what you came by for? Because I can go back to bed. April, can we sit down? Yeah, sure. What is it? It's about your mother. -You found her. Where is she? -I'm sorry, April. She died. What? What? I'm sorry, baby. -When? -About a week ago. -What happened? -She left for work. I saw her. And she had a brain aneurysm. A brain aneurysm. She was on the bus all day... ...and no one noticed. She.... They assumed she was just asleep. And when the driver tried to wake her, it was too late. There was nothing anyone could do. I'm sorry. She was at the city morgue. No one claimed her. No identification. She was dead too long... ...so they cremated her. Oh, my God. These are her remains. I.... I put them in this urn. I'm gonna go and pack up her things... ...and you're welcome to come by and get them. I'm sorry, April. If you need anything, April, just come by the church. You take care of her, huh? Yes, of course. April, what were you praying for? What are you doing, man? I'm sleeping. You want some company? That ain't no way for somebody to die. I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye. When was the last time that you spoke to her? A year ago. We.... We had an argument. It's so stupid now. My sister... ...was so strung out. She screwed those kids up. She-- She traded Jennifer for crack one time when she was 9. She was so high one time, she put Byron in the oven. She burned Manny with her crack pipe. And my mother was there every time. Every time. She'd asked me to babysit... ...and I told her I couldn't. And I wasn't doing nothing. I just didn't feel like being bothered. So she got mad at me and I never spoke to her again. I said some things I really wish I could take back. All the good she did for people and she died on a bus. Oh, she was good to everybody. She died on a bus alone. Watch out, y'all, stay close together. I'm coming. Where have you been? Looking for Mama Rose. I have something to tell you. What is it? My mother died. What? Why are you lying? She's not lying. You will say anything to get rid of us, huh? -Jennifer. -lf you don't want us here, we'll go. You don't have to say all that. -It's not true. -You will say anything. -lt is true, Manny. -Can I go feed them? -Yeah. -Jennifer. Jennifer. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. People die. So what? Hey, listen, it's okay to cry or to be upset. I said I'm fine, okay? Yo, turn the damn TV down, please. Hey, Agnes, how you doing? -Good to see you. -Hi, Madea. What you doing sitting out here? Trying to steal something? What's going on with you? My grandmother died. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, babe. My Aunt April's gonna send us back to foster care. They're going to separate us. I'm all Manny and Byron got. If we separate, I don't know-- I don't know what I'm gonna do. -Oh, no. -Calm yourself down, honey. -Calm down. Getting all worked up. -Can we stay with you? Nobody wants us. -That ain't true. Somebody wants you. -I'm only 16. I'm.... -I don't know how to handle all this. -Honey. -I'm tired. I don't-- -Living takes a lifetime. You got a whole lot more living to do, honey. I don't feel like I'm gonna-- I don't feel like I'm gonna make it. You gonna make it. Hush, dear. Gotta keep getting up every day, one day at a time. You're gonna make it. My Grandma Rose used to tell us to pray about it, and if.... Then that's what you ought to do, pray about it, talk to the Lord about it. Yeah, but she only told us-- She never told me how to do it. Would you teach me? Please. -Show you how to pray? -Yeah. Oh, child, I ain't talked to God... ...since the last time I saw a cop in my rearview mirror. I guess I can try. I can try to pray. You know the number? The what? -The number. -The number? To call him. They say "Jesus On the Mainline." I don't know the number. Sit back, sit back. Okay, bow your head. First, giving honor to God, to the head of my life. Father I stretch My hand To thee Father God... ...God of Abraham, lsaac and Jacob. God of Shadrach, Meshach and the billy goat... ...who was in the fiery furnace that they barbecued... ...on the day of Pentecost when the Jewish people returned... ...from the Sabbath day up on the mountaintop in Ethiopia. God of Mary J. Blige. Madea, that don't sound right. That don't sound right. That's not how Mama Rose used to do it. You ain't feeling it? You didn't feel the anointing? -No. -I don't know nothing about praying. But all praying is, is talking to God, having a conversation with him. And at the end, you say the name of Jesus. That's your stamp that will get it up there to him. You hear? Okay. You know who you remind me of right now? You remind me of Peter in the Bible. You know who Peter was? Peter was one of the 12 disciplines. And they were on a boat out on the isle... ...of the Greek Atlantic Ocean. And when they was on this boat, the storm rose up. And the 12 disciplines, they got really, really worried and upset. They said, "Oh, no, what are we gonna do?" They saw someone coming toward them on the water... ...Iooked like a ghost. But it wasn't a ghost. It was Jesus. And Peter say, "Jesus, if that's you, let me come out there." You gotta be careful what you ask the Lord for. So Jesus said, "Come on out." So Peter stepped out of the boat and was walking on the water. He was walking on water? On the water. He was walking on the water toward Jesus. Long as he kept his eyes on him, he stayed on top of the water. He took his eyes off him, though. You know why? He got distracted. You know why he got distracted? When you got your eye on Jesus, can't get distracted by nothing. Jonah passed by in the belly of the whale. He looked down, Free Willy with Jonah inside the belly... ...and it made him distracted, so he started to sink. He said, "Jesus, Jesus, help me." Jesus said, "l can't. I gotta go to Calvary. I'm late." Jesus went to the cross. He said, "I'm gonna send you a comforter. When the comforter come, you gonna be all right." So he's swimming. He try and swim. He's worried, Jaws was coming, all that-- Spielberg had did that Jaws thing. It was surrounding him. He was worried. -You know what happened? -What? Just in the nick of time-- When you think you ain't gonna make it... ...in the nick of time, something happens. Noah came up in the arch. That's right, Noah came rowing up in the arch of St. Louis Arch... ...and he pulled right up beside him. He got on there, he said, "Thank you for saving me." Noah said, "No problem, man. Cool, what's up, fool?" He said, "Come on, let me show you around." Noah had turned the arch into a cruise ship. Ain't have nothing to do after he saved the world. Hey, you know who was on there? -Eve. -Eve? She was in the VlP section. Yeah, that's right. And Peter asked, he said, "Eve, come on, go to the show." So she went to see this show. And they had tigers. They had two tigers, two bears, two lions. You know, the male and the female. Well, Siegfried and Roy was there, and they had the two lions. And them lions jumped out and scratched Eve. That's how Eve get them two paws right there. You ever see Eve with the paws? She got two paws right there. Read your Bible some time, honey. Read your Bible. This is a mess, April. I mean, you don't care? I don't know. I mean, Tanya... ...you know I can't help them kids. I mean, I didn't ask for none of this. I ain't never seen a more selfish person in my life. Okay, what do you mean by that, Tanya? I mean, April, you gotta care about somebody other than yourself. You don't know me, man. -Oh, I know you. -No, you don't. -That's the problem. -Tanya, look, l-- Look, I didn't come here for that, okay? Honey, I love you, so I can say this, okay? Girl, you always drunk. Always. There's not a day that I have not seen you drunk. You just care about alcohol and "Where's Randy?" I mean, I'm sick of hearing that. You got a bigger problem on your hands right now. If I wasn't your friend, if I didn't love you... ...I wouldn't bring it to you real just like I'm giving it to you right now. You don't care about nobody but yourself. I mean, you sleeping with a married man. You know why? Because you don't want him around all the time. You got that big old house, and you only want you in it. You won't even give a bum on the street 50 cents. I mean, you don't sound shallow, you just sound damn selfish. Oh, so I'm just a bad person, huh? I'm just evil. You know what? Ain't nothing wrong with what you do. But as long as it works for you, that's all good, right? You need to get your life together fast. Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Miss Tanya. Tanya. Bravo. Do it. What's wrong with him? His blood sugar went up, so I gave him his insulin shot. Don't worry about it, I got it. He'll be fine. I can't keep y'all. You don't owe us nothing. I think we can find you a great foster home. When I grow up, I'm gonna be just like you. Ain't gonna give a damn about nobody but myself. That's the only way to be. What the hell do I look like... ...sitting over here worried looking after him, huh? I'm 16. When my life gonna start, huh? I'm not ready for kids, Jennifer, I'm not. I can't do this. Just leave us alone. Just leave us alone, just.... You don't need to be hearing about all this. -Wow, you're up already. It's early. -Yeah. That's a good thing. You're sleeping your life away. -Am l? -Yeah. Hey, come with me. I have something for you. Where are we going? It's a surprise. Come on. I don't play that getting my hair wet, so don't.... -You got a shower cap? -No, sorry. You didn't tell me I was gonna be working out. -Have fun. -Why do you sleep all day, huh? Why not? Why not? I don't know, and that's not an answer. Well, since you're asking all the questions... ...why did you hold me the way you did... ...when I told you my mother died? Because you needed to be held. Yeah, but it was the way you held me. I mean, you held me like.... Like you care. You don't know that I care by now? Why? You know, if you have to ask that question... ...then you just don't know yourself, I guess. That's still not an answer. April, I think that you are a very warm and sensitive... ...and loving person. And you are funny. You are very funny. I'm not that funny. Cut it out. But you hide it. You hide it all away. I don't understand. You put up this wall so that nobody sees it. But I see through it. I don't understand you and him. -Talking about Randy again? -Yes. He's not so bad. He's not so good either. It doesn't make sense to me. Do you love him? He helps me out. He pays the bills. That's not what I asked. April, do you love him? In a way. I guess. That is not love, April. Loving a married man, sharing him with his wife. Love is not having somebody to pay your bills. It's not having to work all night. That is not love. Love is.... Love is being too tired from the night before... ...to even go to work the next day. Whatever. April, we're all looking for love, one way or another. Love is having someone there in the morning when you wake up... ...that is gonna be there with you, thick or thin, right or wrong. Let's go. Oh, my God, I can't believe I let you talk me into getting on a boat. Be glad I didn't get my hair wet. You know black girls don't like getting their hair wet. Thirsty? Yes, I would like something to drink, please. -Hi. -Hi, kids. -How was school? -Fine. -Good. You okay? -Yeah. He's all right. Okay, good. I have a surprise for everybody, okay? Come on, April. I want you to see. -You're gonna love it. Come on. -You and your surprises. Keep your eyes closed, okay? It's a big surprise, come on. Come on, Manny, Byron. Come here. Come here. Stand right here. Jennifer, come on. Right there. -Okay, you ready? -Yeah. Open your eyes. -ls this our room? -This is your room. -Thanks. -No, it's not. -But it looks like it's for us. -lt is. It's not. Where you steal all this stuff from? I did not steal any of this stuff. The church gave it to me. It was in the basement. Right. My bed. -My bed. -Yes, Byron, that's your bed. I'd never heard him speak before. My bed. -My bed. -This is the bomb, Sandino. Why you gotta get their hopes up for? You know she don't want us here. Hey, that could change. "Could" is not definite. She definitely don't want us here. Listen, how about you stay in this room for as long as you're here, okay? I made it for you. Thank you, but we good. We stay downstairs. Come on, y'all. Manny, Byron, I said come on. -Do we have to go? -Yes, we have to go. Why didn't you tell me you were doing this, huh? -Now they're upset. -What difference does it make, April? You made it very clear to them that you don't care. April, come on, we're going. What the hell are you knocking on this door for, Mexico? -I'm trying to wake up April. -For what? Because we're supposed to be going to church. Well, April ain't going to no church. Hear this real good, houseboy. Knock on this door again, I'm sending you back to Mexico in a pine box. Ain't a damn thing for you in here. This morning, our subject comes from the text found in Luke 15 and 8. It reads, "Either what woman having 10 pieces of silver... ...if she lose one, does not light a candle... ...and sweep the house and seek diligently until she find it? And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and says: 'Come rejoice with me... ...for I have found the piece which I had lost."' -Where the hell are you going? -To church. Church? No, you ain't. Randy, I'm going to church. We can talk about this later. April. Hey, come here now. I said you ain't going, all right? -Who's gonna stop me? -And what is all this? I've never seen you dressed for no church. How do I look? April. April, I'm talking to you. Today, our subject is value added. There are three things I wanna talk about from this subject. Number one, this woman was a good steward. All right. Because she took time to know what she had... ...and how much of what she had. Therefore, because she watched it every day... ...she knew when a piece of silver was lost. Yeah. Secondly, she gave value to each piece of silver. She did not extol one piece over the other. And thirdly, when she discovered that one was lost... ...she swept the house clean to find it. Amen. You don't know what it is to walk the floor worried... ...over something you've lost. -Aunt April's here. -All of us love... ...and somehow our love is limited... ...when someone ends up somewhere that we don't want them to be. But what she knew is that even though this piece of silver was lost... ...it had not lost its value. -Amen. -lt had just lost its usefulness. You cannot help anyone when you're lost. You cannot fulfill your mission in life when you're lost. You cannot help your family or your fellow man when you're lost. And somebody has to care enough about you... Yeah. ...to put a light in a very dark place... ...when you're caught in the crevices of life... -...and can't figure out how to get out. -All right. You need somebody that's gonna care enough about you... ...that says you're worth it. I want you to know you're worth me waiting on. Oh, Lord, have mercy. I said you're worth me waiting on. There are some things that we face. You've come to people... ...and it seems as if they don't wanna know. I understand it. I've been there. As a matter of fact, let me say it like this: I've hurt so many nights I cried so many hours Trying to make it right Trying to make it right But just didn't have the power And you ignored all my tears It hurt me so bad Sing that song! You wanted them to disappear I tried to let it go But I guess You just don't wanna know Listen. If I had a dime for every time I tried to call your name Some tell me Some tell me I'd be wealthy I'd be wealthy Amen, amen. Oh, Lord But I learned that I could cope -Yeah. -Yeah. - Yes, I did -Yes. Through my struggle I discovered I discovered I could make it In nights so long and cold So cold You don't know how cold I discovered I discovered I could take it Now I wouldn't I wouldn't change a thing Lord, have mercy. Not for the knowledge Not for the knowledge That I've gained You know what I discovered in my trials? I learned that I could grow I really did I tried, I tried to let, let it go I did I tried, tried to let it show But I guess -You just don't wanna know -Just don't wanna know -No, no, no - Yes Really don't wanna know You don't wanna know How many nights I cried You don't know how many times I felt like I was gonna die But I kept on moving I kept on hoping I kept on believing And now I can tell you - That I'm over - That I'm over it now Anybody here. -Say "I'm over, I'm over it now" -Over it now -I can't explain it -I can't say how -But right now, I'm over it -But I'm over it I'm hoping right now One morning I just broke free And the chains They just dropped off from me People can talk about me -As much as they please -Just don't wanna know But I'm all grown up now I said I'm all older now And I got the victory Because I'm over -But I'm over it now -I'm over it now -Over it now -I'm over it now -I can't say how, but I'm over it -Say it again, say I'm Over it now Just wave your hand if you know you're over it. If you feel the presence of God... ...if you feel the anointing of God, just declare now... ...that I'm over it now. Say it right now. Over it now It's over, I'm walking out of here free. Because I'm over it now Amen. I'm really over it now Went to a meeting one night And my heart wasn't right But something got ahold of me And I'm over it now Just don't wanna know Wilma. Wilma, would you just...? People don't know you've been through some things. They think because you're looking so pretty in your hat... ...they don't know what you've been through. But could you say one good time, "I'm over it now"? I'm over it now Over it now, I can't say how But I'm over it now Right now, right now, right now -I'm over it now -I'm over it now -I'm over it now -I don't have to live with it Don't have to live with it -Don't have to be in it -Don't have to be in it I'm over it, over it now Over it now, I can't say how But I'm over it now -Now -Right now -Now, now, now -Right now -Now, now, now -Now, now, now I'm over it now I tried To let it go I really did I tried to let it show Thank you, Jesus But right now I learned that I could grow But I guess You just don't wanna know Hallelujah. You're worth it. Give him praise because he's worthy. His purpose is real. You're gonna make it. You'll be all right. You don't have to worry at all. You're over it now. You're over it now. Hold on. I'll be right back. How you doing, beautiful? I've seen the way you've been looking at me. See, this here my house... ...and I can let you and two little nappy boys stay here. Right. I'll get you all the medicine you need. I need to give him his insulin. Now, see, what you need to do is take care of me. If you don't stop right now, I'm gonna tell April. You think she's gonna believe you, huh? You think she's gonna believe you? Take it off. I said-- What are you doing? Get off of him! Stop it! Stop it! What are you doing to him? -What is going on here? -It's okay. It's okay. Come on. He tried to rape her. They lying on me, right-- They lying on me. No, no, no. This little slut-- You know she's a slut. She tried to get me to have sex for money. Baby-- Sandino, you saw her! -Tell her what you saw. -He tried to rape her! Who you gonna believe, huh? April, who you gonna believe, huh? Them or me? -He's lying, he's-- -He's lying, April, he's lying. Who you gonna believe? Them or me, babe? You, baby. -He's lying. -April. Go upstairs and get in the tub. -I can't believe you believe him. -It's okay, it's okay. -It's okay. -He's lying! He's lying, April. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Look at me, look at me. Look at me. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Hey, no one's going to hurt you. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's gonna be okay, all right? It's okay. Okay, no one's going to hurt you. Nobody here will hurt you. -Nobody's going to hurt you. -No. It's okay, Jenny. Baby, I think I broke my nose. Oh, baby, thank you. You know I love you, right? Baby, I'm just trying to provide the best life for you I can. -What happened? -Baby, I told you what happened. That little girl tried to get me to have sex with her for money. Baby, these kids ain't no good. They spending up all my damn money, baby, you know? I mean, everything was fine before they got here. It's all their fault, baby. Them kids causing all kind of problems. Paying all these bills around here... ...these damn kids come here snatching up all our money. I didn't want these damn kids here, I told you that. We had all kinds of problems since they got here. Tell me what happened. April, I told you what happened. Tell me what you did. April, I didn't do nothing. That's my niece. She's 16. Baby, calm down now. What did you do? I told you, I didn't do nothing, April. You are just like Lee. April, stop! He told my mother he didn't do nothing either. Stop! Stop it, April. Damn! April, get that thing away from the water. April, stop! You wait here, okay? -You watch your sister. -Stop playing! I told you. Get that thing off! -April, damn it! -Just like Lee. He told my mother he didn't do nothing. April. -That it was my fault, that I did it! -That is plugged in and I'm in water! -Shut up! -He's not worth it. Put the radio down. -Stop! Let-- -You want me to put it down? -Ap! Calm down! -You want me to put it down? April, no! You got three minutes to get your stuff and you get the hell out of here. Hey. Why did you leave him alone? April, he's gone, okay? I took his keys, he won't be back. Are you okay? I should've known. -April, this is not your fault. -I should've known. The way he looked at her. I should've known. Like my mother should've known. She was always saying... ...whatever happens in this house stays in this house. Nothing ever gets healed if you keep it covered up. I should've known. When a man... ...a grown man... ...takes interest in a little kid... ...something ain't right. Come on, April, that's enough. Get off of me. Are you one too? What? A child molester. -Are you a child molester, Sandino? -Are you asking me this question? Why do you care so much about those kids? I hit a nerve. -Enough. -What do you like, huh? Do you like the little girls or do you like the little boys? I said, that's enough. You shut your mouth. Who are you talking to? Come back here. Come back here. Hey! Hey! Tell me. -Stop it. -What is it? -Tell me! -Enough, April. You get your stuff out of my house! I'm not a child molester, you stop calling me that. -Why are you so uncomfortable? -You wanna make me a bad person... ...for showing these kids some love? These kids that have nobody? You're sick! You're out of your mind, you know that? You don't know my life, April. I have nobody. From the time that I was 7 years old... ...and picking coca leaves ...and getting beaten when I'm hungry or tired. When I'm old enough... ...the cartel send me to recruit children to do the same thing. I see these kids, I wanna help them, and you wanna get in the way of that! I feel sorry for you. What the hell are you looking at? Move out of the damn way! You don't ever have to worry about him coming back. He's never coming back. -Get some sleep. -Wait. Aunt April. Thank you for believing me. Baby, I believed you when you said it. I know that look. Wait, wait. If you let us stay here, I promise we won't be no trouble. I'll cook and clean for you. And the boys, I'll take care of them. You won't have to do nothing. -Jennifer-- -Wait, let me finish. -I'll quit school, I'll get a job. -Jennifer. You don't have to quit school. And I'll help you pay the bills... ...and I can be a good girl. I won't be so angry. I'm just so tired of going from place to place. I need y'all to stay with me. I just messed-- I messed everything up. And I gotta fix this. So you gotta stay here with me, okay? And I really-- I would love it if you taught me how to take care of your brothers. Jennifer. We will get through this, okay? You're a good girl. We're gonna be all right, okay? Now, get your brothers and come up to your new room. Hey, come on, go get your brothers. Manny? You have to get up. Come in. -She's gonna let us stay. -I know. -Ain't that supposed to be good? -Yeah, Manny, that's really good. Why do you look sad? I'm not sad. I have to go away for a while. -What? -Where you going? I'm gonna shoot straight with you guys, okay? Things aren't going very well with me and your aunt. So it's best that I leave. In the meantime, I'm going to call you... ...and write letters. Okay? And you make sure you write me back. All right. I understand. I mean... ...you gotta do what you gotta do, right? We're gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. Give me a hug. All right? -I'm gonna miss you so much. -I'm gonna miss you too. -Hey. -Hey. He's gone. Yeah, I know. You wanna help me unpack some of Mama Rose's things? Sure. That's cute. You know, I think you're wrong about him. What do you know about this? That's a good man... ...and I don't think you should just let him go like that. You're too young to understand, baby. Yeah, but... ...I know there's a lot of bad people in this world. -Yeah. -lf you find somebody you can trust... ...then you should probably hold on to them. I mean, it's like.... When Peter was walking on the water... ...and he got distracted by the whale and he started to drown... ...and Noah came in in the St. Louis Arch-- Wait, wait. What? What? He was drowning and Noah-- He was-- Wait a minute. Who taught you this story? Madea was telling me all these Bible stories-- Oh, Lord, her? Girl, even I know that ain't right. I know that story. Come on. I guess I should've known better, huh? Yeah, I guess I'm gonna have to take you to church more often, huh? What is it? That's weird. They're singing Mama Rose's favorite song. She still knows when to show up. Come on down now for prayer if you want the Lord. Hi. Hi. I'm.... I'm so sorry. I'm not really good at knowing how to love... ...anything... ...or anybody. But I really like having you around. And since you talked me into keeping the kids... ...I really, I would love for you to just stay here with me... ...and help me with the kids. Please? Say something. -What do you want me to say? -What do you wanna say? I don't know. What is this? Your way of telling me that you like me or something? I do. I can admit that. I think I love you. Please say something. I don't know what to say. I mean, you're a good human being. I love you like a friend, like how I love Tanya. Okay. Like you love Tanya. -You don't believe me. -No, I don't believe you, okay? -You don't believe I love you. -April, let's not get into this, okay? No, tell me, please. It's okay. You don't fully love yourself, okay? Everybody that loves you, you push them away. You keep them at a distance. What are you, a psychiatrist? Not a psychiatrist, but I know love. Look at you, that's not love. You're drinking, smoking yourself to death. Your father dies of liver cancer. You don't love yourself the way I love you. What? I said that I love you. What? Like a...? Like a friend, like a buddy? Like a pal or something? No, April, I don't wanna make love to my buddies and my pals. I'm in love with you. I'm ready to love you... ...but you have to be ready to give it back the right way. I wanna learn... ...how to love the right way. Will you show me? I'll show you. That's right. Can't hold my girl down. Because she a good woman, y'all. Y'all ready? There you have it. I'm still with you, my sisters. My troubled sisters. I still got problems too. You're not alone. He's slow. Elevator don't go all the way up there. The lights is on at the mall-- Oh, no, no. The mall is open but ain't nobody shopping. You ain't gonna eat? You gotta learn how to talk in the real world. When people ask if you slow, you say: "Do you ride the big bus or the little bus?" -Don't know what I'm talking about? -No. Okay, fine, yeah. I believe you're on the little bus too. Go ahead, boy. You funny. You the next.... Who that? Tyler Perry! You the next Tyler Perry, man. I'm telling you, you funny. I love that Madea. He's slow. The mall's open but ain't nobody shopping. What are you talking about? The elevator don't go all the way up to the top floor. The car is running but ain't no engine. Are you okay? I'm-- No, hell, I'm fine. Is he okay? I'm just trying to-- Boy, maybe you're a little slow too. Maybe your book ain't got no pages in the middle. Your grandma went to work for four days and ain't ever come back? -Yeah. -I know what she do for a living. What? Well, I'll tell you when you get a little older. There's a reason women disappear for four days and come back. The looks he give me are priceless. Okay, keep going. Shut your mouth. -She never, never came back? -Yup. I wouldn't have come back either trying to feed him. I hate you. Manny, eat your food and shut up. Yeah, you better eat it, because I'm getting ready to choke you out. Yeah, they can talk to me. Where's your mama? Say something else to me. I dare you to say something to me. Say one more-- Say one more thing. I dare you, I dare you. Ugly. Leave him alone. Eat. What you laughing at, Freddie? They're lying. I can still hear you, you know. Mabel, I'm gonna beat him down. Will you shut up? -Who the hell you talking to? -Get your hands off me. -Back up. -Who the hell you talking to? -On mark. -Stop laughing. Turn right here. The camera's rolling. Get out the way, crackhead. -I can't work like this. -That'll be cut, we're good. Maybe she was hungry. Hungry, April? I mean, is that a reason to steal? No. Even more, she was caught stealing needles. Wow, did you hear my stomach? Yeah, you don't feed me around here. I'm hungry! Here we go. Go one more time. You touch us again, I'm gonna call 911 this time. You call 91 1, honey. They don't scare me. I call 91 1. I will call them for you. I will ask them over here. I won't ask them to send the police... ...or Child Welfare. I will ask them to straight up send a ambulance. Cough again. Cough one more time. Hell, I'm trying to learn these lines... ...but she over there coughing off-camera. And I'm trying to do a scene. What the hell I'm supposed to do? Come here. Come here, bring me the book now. Bring me the book. I need to see where the hell I am. Come here. Now, give me the lines. "But when I shove it down your throat," would that be a good one? Say it like I say it. -But when I shove it down your throat. -Okay, now settle down. When I shove it down your throat.... There's a letter in here for you. From Mama Rose. To me? -You wanna read it? -No. -No, you read it. -Me? Yeah. "Dear April. If you're reading this, I'm probably past my suffering. April, my dearest child... ...you are beautiful, bright and brilliant. If you're ever nominated for an Academy Award... ...be humble about it. Remember the people that helped you along the way. Props, Hair, Makeup, Wardrobe... ...Grips, Electricians, Camera, Sound... ...script and most of all Mr. Tyler Perry." I knew that one was coming. I knew that was coming. "And, April, if you're ever walking from your trailer... ...and you see an airplane, duck." Duck. Yeah. "Love, Mama Rose." You know what? Everybody just get out of here. Good night.
