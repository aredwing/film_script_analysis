And to hook up with hot schoolgirls! - High five, bro! l'm glad that's been clarified. l was wondering how a girl like you found a boyfriend. You suck at studies and sports. You have no talent. You're Just a fat, ugly loser! You're nothing. She's not nothing! - Yeah, she's a great girl! Just shut up! What do you guys know?. You're even bigger losers than l am. And you! You think you're cool? Because you're skinny, hot and rich? Everyone hates you, Shamira. Everyone loves me, honey. You'll see when they all vote for me in the Head Girl elections. Oh please! Anyone could beat you in that stupid election. Oh really? Can you? Of course. Great. Elections are in 3 months. See you then. Leave my house now. Out! Let her be. The human heart is a very delicate organ. What do you want? - What's wrong, didi? You can tell me. What can you do? - l can help you! Get lost. - Did ArJun dump you, didi? l said, get lost! Don't worry, there are lots of other boys. You'll find another one. Of course. You would know! You're looking for a boyfriend yourself, aren't you? Poor little Booboo wishes he had boobies, doesn't he? No wonder he dumped you. Who would want to date someone like you? l told you to knock... - Shut up! What did you say to Booboo? The truth. You can't slap me like this! l'm not a kid anymore! lf you don't learn to behave yourself, l'll slap you everyday! Fine! Slap me, hit me! l don't care! l hate my life! l hate everything! l wanna die! ln front of everybody, Mummy. Fat, ugly, loser. She said l was nothing. She puts others down to feel better about herself, doesn't she? Yeah, that's exactly what she does! And weren't you doing the same thing with Booboo right now?. Forget about being fat or ugly. lf you're kind to everyone, they won't care what you look like. Booboo! Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry... ...sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry! ArJun... Shamira... and worst of all, even Anchal hates me now. No big deal! Just give her a big hug tomorrow... ...and don't let go till she forgives you. Good idea, right? That's all fine, but what about this election? l Just said that in the heat of the moment. They must've forgotten by now. Have you registered for the election yet? Registration is open. Anchal... So what does 'Horny' mean? Oh my God, are you serious? Ewww! Yuck! So only men can he horny, right? - No. no. Women also! No way! l read it in Mummy's Jackie Collins novel! Gross! Listen, l'm sorry about what l said. You're not a bigger loser than l am. Yeah, we're both equal. No, l'm the bigger loser. That's true... - What? l have a boyfriend now. That makes me cooler. Oooh, Ashish! - Stop it, he's sweet. Ooooh sweet?! - Shut up! Anchal and Ashish sitting on a tree... Kissi... - l'm going to kill you! l see that you've dumped Ashish for your true love, Anchal. What do you want now?. l Just registered for the election. Your turn. unless you're scared... Oh please! l'll do it right away. Let's go, Anchal. - Awesome. One. Two. Three. And four. Great, l have four votes. That's not so bad. Just be positive, Gippi. That's how l got Anchal! Right, Anchal? Yes. l think we need a plan. Let's make a list of things Shamira has that you don't. Then we'll give those things to you. Simple. Wow! How are you so good at this? Gossip girl! Oh... Ok, name one thing she has that you don't. A waist? l have a wastebin. Hot body. What else? She has like 300 friends. Ooh! Popularity. And she gets 90% every year. Good marks. And she has a boyfriend. - Kabir's not her boyfriend! lf everyone thinks they're together then it's the same thing. Boyfriend. Ok next? What next? How am l supposed to get these things? We'll help you, Gippi. Yeah, let's start right away. Yeah, come on! Hot body, remember? Hey, Gips. Didi? Didi, wait... Mummy's here! Maybe she'll have a plan! Let's go! Come on! Hurry! What's this? Your father's wedding card. But he hasn't even called yet! He did. l guess l forgot to tell you. What do you mean you forgot? How does it matter? You know now, don't you? What about the rest of the ceremonies? Like when they put henna and that yellow stuff all over? When are those? Do you still love Papa, Mummy? No, sweetheart. lt's not that. You can talk to me, Mummy. Really? Have you grown up so much? Do you know why your father and l got divorced? Because you fought all the time. And do you know why we fought? No. Because your father was ashamed to have me as his wife. He wanted a beautiful, smart, classy wife. Not a small-town, unsophisticated woman like me. Really? - He used to be after me everyday. 'Dress properly! Learn how to talk! Stop embarrassing me!' One day, l got tired of this humiliation. l told him to divorce me if he hated me so much. And he actually did it? lt seemed like he had been waiting for that day. l never thought Papa could be like that. lt's very difficult to find a man... ...who knows all your flaws, and still loves you. When he called that day, l got scared. You'll have a new mother now. Beautiful, young, must be stylish too... So that's what it is! Do you think that Jennifer is better than you? She's nothing compared to you! She's really dumb and boring! And l think she's losing her hair too! She'll be bald in no time! We can't stand her! So, l have nothing to fear then? Not at all. As you all know, the new Head Boy and Girl elections are very near. So let's meet the candidates. Ladies first. Thank you guys, thank you so much. As you already know, l'm Shamira Chauhan... ...and l want to become your next Head Girl. l hate talking about myself like this... ... but it's important to know your candidates right? Well, l've been class prefect for 3 years. l'm president of the sports club, and captain of the basketball team. l've won 2 medals for mathematics, 4 for history and 7 for science. And, of course, l represented our school.. ..at the Bourn vita Quiz Contest on Zee TV. l'm sure you want a Head Girl who excels in every sphere... ...and who will bring glory to our school. Thank you and l'll see you at the elections. Come, my child. Hi everyone... My name is Gurpreet Kaur. Everyone calls me Gippi. You can call me Gippi too. l think l should become the next Head Girl because l'm fun... And funny... And l suck at speeches so l've prepared something for you. lf everybody could clear the stage please? Didi! Didi! Gurpreet Kaur, ladies and gentlemen. Oops, sorry. ''Gippi''. She was right, she really is very funny. And the funniest thing is that she thinks she can win this election. Wow, hilarious! Why do we even try? l'm done. l was stupid to think l could beat her. What are you doing here? - l... lf you're here to make fun of me, then please go away. Why do you always think that about me? You're always with that Shamira, so... l know. But l don't want to be with her anymore. l want to be with you. What are you talking about? l like you, Gippi. l want you to win this election. But... why? Remember when you fell off your chair on the first day of class? Yeah... Do you know what l told Shamira that day? That girl is such a loser? No! l told her that l used to do that in my old school all the time. Were you a loser in your old school? No, l was Just... a regular guy. l guess boys' schools are different. Here they make such a big deal out of everything. l wish l were a boy. - No, l like that you're a girl. Anyway, don't give up now, Gippi. You can win this election. Excuse me, Sister. - Yes? May l? - Sure! Hi everyone. l Just wanted to finish my introduction properly. l'm Gippi. l don't have any medals or certificates. l suck at studies and l can't play any sport. l can only do one thing well, and that's dance! But you saw that for yourself, didn't you? And, let's admit it. Most of you are like me. We're not great at studies, we hate sports. We think we're fat or ugly or stupid and that everyone is better than us. But trust me, it's not like that. We're all the same. So, if you want your Head Girl to be some great achiever, then vote for Shamira. But if you want your Head Girl to be like you, then vote for Gippi! The male reproductive organ is called the penis. lt is supported by a pair of testicles. Silence class, silence! The testicles are... - Excuse me, Ma'am. Yes? Ma'am today is my birthday. l came to give you toffees. Oh, so sweet. Please come in. Happy birthday to you. Class please wish her happy birthday. Happy Birthday! So where were we? Ah! Testicles. Namaste. Why aren't you eating anything, Booboo? l've been waiting for the chicken tikka forever! Shit! What's wrong? - He's here! Who? - ArJun! So what? Let's leave, Mummy. l don't want to meet him! l'm sitting at my ex-husband's wedding and you want to leave? Shut up and sit tight. How are you, Pappi? - Good, thanks. l've had enough! Of what? - Don't move! Gippi? Papa? - Hi love, have you eaten yet? We're not here to eat, Papa! Don't you think you should go talk to Mummy? lt wasn't easy for her to come here. We need to talk. Whenever l run into you, or think of you, l feel like shit. l... No, it's not your fault. l mean, you were kind of aJerk... ... but l also acted like a silly girl. l... So, l Just wanted to say that l'm over it. We're cool now. You're different. l like it. l know, l like it too. So, now that we're friends, do you wanna hang out some time? Why don't you try finding girls your own age? Here's my Gippo! Where did you run off to? l thought l'd give you guys a moment alone. l see. She looks Just like you, Pappi. Just this round little nose is like mine. Go call our little dumpling. lt's time for a family photograph! Smile everyone! What a beautiful family!

And your skin? Wow! Ok... So listen, Gippi. We've decided to help you. But the voting's over. l don't need any help now! Now is when you need us the most. Explain. Like... what are you going to wear to the Christmas Party? l don't know, l was going to go shopping with Anchal. Anchal?! Are you kidding? You can't become Head Girl wearing some tacky outfit!

Yeah, the more you hang out with us, the more you'll learn. Ew, let's go. - See you later, Gips. What did these two want? l don't know... they wanted to take me shopping, give me advice... Huh? Maybe Shamira's planning something. lsn't it too late for a plan? Hmm. Oh my God! lt could mean Just one thing then! Even they think that you're going to win. Shit! Are you really going to become the Head Girl, Gippi? You know, they're right. You should go shopping with them. Lets not take any chances right now. But l promised you we would go together. Just go. Don't worry about me. l'll always be around. Hi Gippi, we knew you'd come. - Let's go. No. No! Guys! lsn't this cool? No!! Absolutely no milkshakes. Only green tea.

Don't worry, Mummy. l'll eat them all. Bye! All the best! Good luck! l'll pray for you! l got you a gift. Junglee Hits? Thank you! l thought our first dance together... ...should be to your favorite Shammi Kapoor's song. Choose one. Didn't you like the gift? No, l love it. But... Kabir... l shouldn't do these stupid dances anymore. Doesn't suit a Head Girl. - Seriously? No, but l love all these songs! Tumne muJhe dekhaaa... Are you going to be like this next year? What do you mean? - You're already changed so much... And you haven't even won the election yet. Do you want me to always be a laughingstock? Gippi, they were laughing with you, not at you. That's why they voted for you. Look at yourself. These shoes, this dress. What have you done to your hair? Do you know who you remind me of? Shamira. So, what's wrong with looking like her? Well, congratulations. Mission accomplished. What's wrong, Shamira? What do you think? You're going to win tonight. You know it. l know it. Everyone knows it. And you also know that you have done nothing to deserve it. And what have you done? Besides humiliating everyone around you? Oh really? You think that's all l've done? Do you know that l wake up at 5am everyday? l take morning classes to keep my grades up! And then at school, while you sit around gossiping... ... l manage clubs, practice sports, hold conferences... l don't get a single moment off. My hair has to be perfect. My skin has to be perfect. Even my goddamn socks need to be perfect. Do you know, l haven't had icecream in 3 years? And you're going to become Head Girl now?. Without doing any of this? Do you even know what being a Head Girl means? Hi Gippi! - Where were you? Gorgeous dress! Have you guys seen Anchal? Oh my God! She's wearing the most ridiculous dress! Come, come! Wow, Gippi. You look so beautiful tonight. Wish we could say the same for you! A Head Girl can't be seen with someone like that! ls that your grandma's dress? lsn't it hideous? Guys, l think she looks great! - She obviously needs help. Tell her to go change, Gippi. Maybe she'll listen to you. Gippi... Say something... Children, children, children! lt gives me great Joy to see you all looking so beautiful and happy. Merry Christmas, all of you! - Merry Christmas! lt's time for election results! May the current Head Girl and Boy come on stage please. Ladies first. The new Head Girl of St. Mary's Convent is... Gurpreet Kaur! Gurpreet, my child, please come up on stage and take your badge. Congratulations! - Thank you, Ma'am. Oh shit. l actually won. Actually, l wasn't interested in this election at all. l signed up for it only because Shamira challenged me to. l Just wanted to show her that a girl like me can also win something. l want to thank everyone who helped me win this election. My mother, who has always inspired me. My brother, who supports me in everything l do. And my best friend Anchal, who... Hi! Who... Has always been there for me, unconditionally. And who l was going to insult publicly, before this announcement. l'm so sorry, Anchal. How could l be such an ass? l can never become Shamira. And you know what? l don't even want to! l don't want to stand here and give a speech. l want to sit in the corner with Anchal and crack stupid Jokes. l want to take this uncomfortable dress off and put paJamas on. l don't want green tea! l want my Mummy's samosas! l want to do silly Shammi Kapoor dances with Kabir. l'm really sorry guys, if l'm letting you down. lf you ever need a friend, l'm always here. But for now... Sister, may l please step back from the election? There. Go. Are you serious? - Yeah, dude! Go! But, on one condition. Promise me that you'll never be mean to me again. l can't promise anything, but l'll try. Great. - Great. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! You wanna go to the after party? This party is so over.
