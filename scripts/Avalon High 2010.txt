I remember you used to do that all the time when you were four. I bet when I was four, I wasn't dreaming about medieval combat. I was. What a surprise. Well, as long as you're up, you can unpack. Sure. What's the point? All unpacked, sweetie? Getting there. Good. I see King Arthur and his Merry Men have once again taken over the house. It was Robin Hood who had the Merry Men, sweetie. Arthur had the Knights of the Round Table. You know that. Yes, I do. How could I not know that, when it's all you guys talk about? We're professors of medieval literature, Allie. It's our job. I know, but you guys talk about King Arthur so much, I'm starting to dream about him. And not like most girls who dream about knights in shining armor. Mine have dirt all over them and BO and are missing half their teeth. You're actually quite accurate. During Arthurian times, dental hygiene wasn't considered to be... Dad! Seriously! Sorry. Sorry. Eww. Here you go. Thanks. I don't know why you guys bother to unpack. We're just going to move in six months, right? Which would be great. I mean, like you always say, who wants to live in one place their whole life? What? Well, it's not going to be six months this time. What, one month? Two? Maybe I should legally change my name to "New Girl. " It's three years, Allie. What? We're going to be here for three years. This place is... special. We were just offered contracts at the university. So, we're staying? Yes. Now, we know that three years is a long time... Wait. I'm going to be at Avalon High until I graduate Yes. And I can try out for the track team? And finish a season? And make actual friends? Yes. Yes! Yes! Yes! My coffee, my coffee... Oh, sorry. Whoo-hoo! Thank you, thank you, thank you. Where are you going? Morning. Morning. After you. Thanks. All done? I'll just... Bye. Weird. Are you nervous? Mom, it's, like, my billionth first day of school. I know. So, you're nervous. Of course I'm nervous! You'll be fine. You always are. I'll pick you up at 3:00. Oh. Actually, make it 5:00. I'm going out for track, remember? Bye, Mom. Bye, honey. Marco, why can't you just steal my lunch money like every other bully? I need my locker! What's wrong with yours? Well, Miles, since you asked, mine's too far from class. You don't even go to class! Give me the combination. 1-2-3-4-5. Give it to me, Preschool, or I'll put in the locker. Wow, nerd in a locker. How original. We're now living inside an '80s teen movie. That's enough, Marco! Hooray! If it isn't Will Wagner here to save the day! My hero. What are you gonna do, Will, hit me? You're not worth the detention. Just get outta here, before I change my mind. Okay. Whatever. He can't protect you 24 hours a day. Oh, wow, you know that there are 24 hours in a day? You must be evolving. Thanks, Will. I was about to, as they say, "throw down" with him, but I thought you might want to deal with him yourself, since he's your brother. Step-brother. Hey! Hey. Water Fountain Girl! I guess that's me. Hi. Hey! I didn't know you went to Avalon High. Yeah. I didn't know you went here either. Although, technically, I don't know anyone who goes here. I'm new. I mean, my name's not "New," it's Allie. I'm Will. There. Now you officially know one person. Yep, I'm practically Homecoming Queen. So, are you on the track team? Because of the running in the park. Or maybe you just like running. I love running. Wow. Did I just say "running" like four times? Football, actually. I'm kind of the quarterback. Of course you are. I mean, because you seem so quarterback-esque. Hey, sweetie. Come on, I want to make sure we sit together in History. Hi. Jen, this is Allie. She's new. Allie, this is my girlfriend Jen. Hi! Nice to meet you! Yeah, you, too. There you go. Your friends have already doubled. Wait, lipstick. Will, Jen. Where were you guys this morning? Didn't you get my text? Five burgers for five bucks! Allie, this human garbage disposal is my best buddy Lance. Lance, Allie. Hi. Hey. Did you meet Jen? Jen's the coolest chick in school. Yeah. That she is. Aw, thanks, guys. So, what's your first class? European History with Mr. Moore. Oh, we've got that, too! Come with us! Okay, everybody. Grab a book and a seat. William. Rumor has it you're going to lead Avalon Football to State for the first time this year. Yeah! That's the plan, sir. That's my boy. Class president, Homecoming King, straight-A student, and he's polite. If only I had an entire class full of Will Wagners. I think I'm going to puke. What're you looking at? Here you go. I'm sorry, is there a problem, Miss... Pennington. Allie Pennington. Ah! That explains everything! Everyone, please welcome Avalon High's newest student, Allie Pennington. That's about all you're gonna get. Yeah. Allie's parents are professors of medieval literature at the university, and they also wrote the textbook we'll be using this semester, when we learn about King Arthur and his court. Easy A! Nobody asked you. Hi. I'm Allie. No. No, no, no, no, no. Avert your eyes. Excuse me? You're making a tactical error of monumental proportions right now. By sitting at my desk? By talking to me. I mean, come on! You had a great start. I saw you talking to Captain Everything this morning. You have a chance to be in the popular group. Don't mess it up. I can be friends with whoever I want. Including you. Who said I wanted to be your friend? You. No, I didn't. Then why are you still talking to me? But I'm not. Ah, but by saying you're not talking to me, you are talking to me. Check and mate. Okay, first thing we're going to do is to break up into teams to write research papers. You'll draw your topics out of this. Courtney, you're with Todd. The architecture of Camelot. Interesting. Will, you're with Karen. Can't I be with Jen? No, Jen is with Lance. Ah. How apropos. The sports of Camelot. Jennifer. The tragedy of Camelot. Your paper is gonna be about the love triangle between King Arthur, his wife Guinevere, and his best friend, Sir Lancelot. Ultimately, it destroyed Arthur and Camelot itself. Bit of a downer. Miles, you're with Allie. I'd rather work alone. I'd rather be eating pineapple on a beach in Hawaii, but that's not going to happen either. Fine. I guess she'll do. Wow. Thanks. Pick. The Order of the Bear. I've never heard of that. So much for the easy A. Ask your parents. I'm sure they've heard of the Order. Miles? Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Just tie your shoes. They are tied. Then tie your other shoes. What are you talking about? Just tie your shoes, okay? What am I, your mother? Hmm. Timed 400 meter! Top three make the team! Come on. Let's go! Shoes all tied-y tied-y? Take your marks! Hut! Set! Good job, brother! That was one of the fastest 400s we've seen in years. Welcome to Avalon High Varsity Track. Thank you. Okay, we'll see you here tomorrow, 4:00 p. m. Andrea, you and Jenny, you also. Congratulations. Well done. Coach said I almost broke the school record. In tryouts! That's amazing, sweetheart. We're so proud of you. I'm proud of me, too. You really like it here, don't you, sweetie? Yeah, I do. I feel like this is where we're meant to be. So. Did you make some new friends today? A few. What's with that smile? Did you see that smile? I saw it. So, did someone float your boat? "Float my boat"? What year is this? He means, did you fancy anyone? "Fancy"? Really, you guys. Century-up. I think she's dodging the question. Absolutely Oh! I'll get it! Who could that be? Miles. What are you doing here? We have a paper due. In three weeks. I don't like to dilly-dally. Do you want to do this or not? I guess. Allie, do you want to introduce us to your friend? Oh, yeah. This is Miles. We're doing a paper together. Nice to meet you, young man. Come on in. I don't understand. What's the... Seems like a nice guy. Reminds me of me. Miles, do you want some pie? Can we just find the book we're going to use and call it a night, Miles? We have a lot of time to do this. I always do my assignments in half the time allotted. Why? To prove that I'm better than everyone else. And more modest. That, too. That was sarcasm. How is it sarcasm if you're right? Never mind. Okay. I cannot find anything on The Order of the Bear anywhere. Can't we just ask your parents? Are you kidding? If I tell them I'm doing a paper on King Arthur, they'll never leave me alone. No, no, I will find it myself. I wonder what they ate in Camelot. Mutton, with a side of beets. Mmm. And sage water, but only from the north. I didn't even know I knew that! It must've seeped in subconsciously while my parents were going on and on about King Arthur. And on and on. And on. Miles? You have any ice? Yeah, yeah. It's in the freezer. Here, I'll get it for you. Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow! Here you go. Back to work. What? How did you know I was going to need some ice? Coincidence. No, you did the same thing earlier with the shoelaces. It's not that hard to guess. You seem pretty clumsy. But... Just drop it, okay? You got it. Thank you. Now, can't we just ask your parents about this Order of the Bear thing and save some time? Fine. The Order of the Bear. Anyone? Have you heard of it? Whoa. Jackpot! The Order of the Bear is an ancient organization, which believes that King Arthur will one day be reincarnated. Right. And when is this going to happen? Arthur will return when he is truly needed to bring the world out of the dark and into a new age of enlightenment. You mean bring back Camelot? It's a metaphor. You can't be sure. I'm pretty sure. He can't be sure. But even as a piece of fiction, it's actually quite interesting. Let's see. Ah! "As the keepers of the prophecy, "it falls to members of the Order "to search for potential Arthurs in each and every generation. "But beware the Dark Forces. "Led by a reincarnation of Mordred, "determined to find the next Arthur and destroy him "before he can realize the prophecy. " What they're saying... If Arthur isn't found soon, Mordred and his followers will send us back into the DarAges. Ignorance, humiliation, suffering... High school. It's no joke, Allie. Some more seriously than others. Some people are fanatics about it. Crazy. You're not. We're not. Here, read. There's a lot of good stuff in there. Refresh your memory. Okay. Mom's mad. Camelot. Okay. Tomorrow, we'll be talking about sewage systems in King Arthur's day. So, if I were you, I'd plan on eating a light lunch. Allie? Yeah? Were you able to find some information on the Order from your parents? True to form, they had a dusty, 50-pound book about it. Fascinating! Ha! Did you read the prophecy? Mmm-hmm. What did you think? I don't know. The whole "reincarnation of King Arthur" thing is a little far-fetched, don't you think? It's only far-fetched if it isn't true. Don't tell me you believe in it, too? Oh, absolutely! You're a very lucky girl to be able to read the prophecy firsthand. I could bring in the book for you, if you want to see it. Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't ask you to do that. A book like that must be so fragile. I'd be afraid of damaging it! Yeah. It's probably just best to leave it right where it is. Just thought I'd ask. Okay. What did he want? Are you in trouble? I don't want to be friends with a troublemaker. Miles, are you finally admitting we're friends? I admit nothing. Just tell me what Moore wanted. He just wanted to talk about the Order of the Bear. Wow. Informal, post-class chit-chat. Way to pull the Teacher's Pet spot out from underneath me. Some friend you turned out to be. Bye, Miles. Where are you going? The cafeteria. Do you wanna come with me? Okay. Hi. Hi. Is this yours? Yeah, it blew away. Right to me. Must be fate. Thanks. So, what are you doing out here? Running, thinking. Running and thinking. This is obviously the thinking part. I figured. Okay. Well, I'll leave you alone, then. No, it's okay. Stay. You know, most people just run right by this part of the forest, but it's great in here. Listen, hear the wind in the trees. It's like music. Football players aren't supposed to talk like that. You're making fun of me? No, no. I didn't mean to. No, hey, it's just... It seems like all people can talk to me about is football. Okay. Well, what else do you want to talk about? See? That's the problem. I can't think of anything else. Can I tell you something? Football used to mean everything to me. I loved the game. But now everyone's counting on me to win the championship, and get my scholarship. You're getting a football scholarship? That's amazing! I don't have one yet. But I need one, or no college. No pressure there. You're a great athlete. Everybody knows that. And all great athletes have pressure on them all the time. You can't be afraid of it. You have to embrace it. And the way you do that is to remember what victory felt like, that feeling when you lead your team to glory. And if you can live in that moment and want it again with all your heart, nothing can stop you. Wow. That was... Thank you. I don't know where that came from. What if I lose? Then maybe State wasn't meant to be. Not the answer I was hoping for. Sorry. I just mean... Maybe everything happens for a reason. You think so? I didn't, but I'm starting to. Wow. You guys have been together for a while, huh? Almost three years. Don't ask. Ask what? Why I didn't answer the phone. Hey, want to run some more? Sure. Oh. Uh, wait. I forgot. My dad's making burgers for dinner. Burgers, huh? Sounds good. Yeah, they are. Yep, my dad makes some pretty good burgers there. Oh, wait. Did you want to come over for burgers? Just as friends. So, it'd just be like... Like a friend-burger. Yeah, I would love a "friend-burger. " Ah. Perfect. There we go. Good. Oh, I got that, sir. Oh, yeah. Ohh. Thank you. No problem. Yeah. Thanks. Will, you're welcome here any time. You're wonderful. Mom, please! What? He's class president, the quarterback and Homecoming King. He's very impressive. Very impressive. One of the professors told me that you really helped turn the team around. Not to mention bringing a lot of pride back to the school. "His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd; "On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode; "From underneath his helmet flow'd "His coal-black curls as on he rode... " "As he rode down to Camelot. " It's a poem about how Arthur became the leader Britain needed. Seems like Will did the same thing for Avalon High. I don't know how things are at your house, but around here, dinner just isn't complete without a King Arthur poem. Excuse me. Oh. Would you like some lettuce? We're all good. We're all good. Try some of the potato salad. Mom made it. Thanks for dinner. Anytime. You know, if you're out running and get hungry or whatever. There's a party at my house after Friday's game. You should come. Sure. I'd love to. I'd better go. Yeah. Hey, Jen. How are you? So? Did he ask you on a date? No! We're just friends. Those were friend-burgers! Okay. Sure. Just friends. Got it. Seriously! I just gave him a football pep talk, that's it. Well, if you say that's it, I guess that's it. Good. Okay. That's not it. No. Ready? Down. 28, set. Hut! Second. Long on the 35. Wagner fakes left under pressure. He throws deep to a wide-open Benwick. He makes the catch. He breaks the tackle. I don't know how he kept his feet inbounds on that one. But he's still going. Touchdown Knights! Yeah! Go Knights! Go, Knights! Go, Knights! Yeah! With a win over the last place Crusaders next week, Will Wagner and his Knights clinch a trip to the State Championship. Will! Way to go! Yeah! Come on. What was that all about? What was what? Will Wagner and his go-to wide-receiver, Lance Benwick, have put on another clinic for us here tonight. Come on, let's go. Tell me again why I'm at a party with a bunch of meathead jocks? I'm a jock, Miles. Am I a meathead? No, but this party is the first step. Fine, then don't come in. Maybe I can make a quick appearance. Hey. What? See? People hate me. Miles, try to smile and be friendly. Just this once. See what happens. See? Now go talk to her. Talk to who? Miles, give it up. You obviously like that girl. She's so pale. It's weird. She's probably a vampire. Teenage vampires are, like, everywhere these days. So, you're not gonna go talk to her? Nope. And this has nothing to do with you being afraid of being rejected? Why should I care if I'm rejected by a vampire? I give up. Hey, what's going on? Your friends are wimps. We seem to have a slight pest control problem. Then I guess we'd better get rid of the pests. Mmm. Dude, you're ruining the party. Need your little goons to save you from the scary candy bugs? No, I need them to stop me from doing something I'll regret. The only thing I regret is my mom marrying your dad. Let's go, guys. This party's a dud. They even let the uber-nerds in. Oh, yeah. When I'm at Yale and you're in jail, I'll be sure to tell everyone how cool you are. Hey, Allie. Sorry about that. Marco, he's complicated. What's his problem, anyway? He's just really angry. That his dad died five years ago, that his mom married my dad, that I'm... I can tell why he might be a little jealous, Will. You're kind of perfect. I mean, your game was perfect. Hey, I only got through that game because of what you said. Thank you. I really should go find Jen. Yeah. Of course. Miles! You okay, man? Yeah, I'm okay. Fine... You will be, too. Uh, thanks. I think. See you later, Allie. Bye. What was that all about, Miles? Are you really okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just... Socializing makes me dizzy. Well, I'm gonna go try to find a bathroom, okay? Don't faint or anything if someone says hello. I'm starting to worry about you. Your eyes are so gorgeous. It's going to be so much fun. Oh. Allie, wait! I want to talk to you. Allie, please! It's none of my business, Jen. Allie, please. Please, don't tell Will. Don't tell Will that he's being lied to by the two people he trusts the most? It's more complicated than that. It really isn't, actually. Allie, I love Will. I'll always love him. Lance does, too. The three of us, we've been best friends since first grade. The last thing we want to do is hurt him. That's why we haven't told him yet. If he found out now, everything would fall apart. It would be like what happened in Camelot. What did you just say? You know, the story in Moore's class. When King Arthur found out that Guinevere and Lancelot were together... He lost all faith in everything and everyone, and didn't have the strength to go on. And Will has so much at stake right now, with the championships and the scholarship. We can't destroy him like this. "We"? I wasn't the one kissing Lance. Allie, we didn't mean for this to happen. It just did. Lance and I are just meant to be together. Haven't you ever felt that? So, you won't tell him? You'll let us do it when the time is right? I'll have to think about it. Al... So you gonna tell Will about Jen and Lance, or what? How did you know? I had a feeling. Never mind. Hey, man. Hey, how's it going? Good. Hey, Allie! Hey, you took off so early from the party. Didn't you have fun? Uh... I was feeling a little sick. Oh. Are you okay now? It comes and it goes. I should get to class. Hey. Hey, save me a seat. I brought the book. Oh, no, Allie, you shouldn't have. I meant what I said about keeping it safe. It's far too valuable. Mr. Moore, my parents said it's fine, as long as I bring it home with me tonight. Say no more. I'll look at it right now and give it back at the end of class. Thank you. You've made an old Arthur buff very happy. Thank you, Allie. Okay. Change in plans. We're watching a video today. Below the tower, on the upper terrace of the castle, his son, Phillip, the young bridegroom to be, practices swordsmanship with his squire. Someday, he is to become the Lord of the Manor, to whom the villagers will pay their homage, as he in turn honors his protector. Riding to battle with him is a vassal, in the tradition of the time. The pages on the timing of the reincarnation were positively enlightening. Thanks again for bringing it in. No problem. And hey, if you ever want to talk Arthur, I'm sure my parents would be happy to hold you hostage. I mean, have you for dinner. Oh! Yeah. I may have to take them up on that. All right, everyone. Out. I don't know how things were at your last school, but around here, you can't get any higher than an "A." So, you can stop trying so hard. It's called being nice, Miles. You should try it, instead of hiding your insecurities behind your snark. Hey, Allie. Hey. I know you know. Know what? That Lance and Jen are cheating on my jerk of a stepbrother. If you know what's good for you, you won't say anything to Will. I haven't said anything, and I don't plan to. But not because you're threatening me. I have my own reasons. Oh. I don't care what your reasons are, just keep your mouth shut and stay out of my way. Or else. Allie! Oh. Hi. Hey, you've been avoiding me ever since my party. Did I do something wrong? No, no. It's just... You know, I've had a lot on my mind. So, you're sure it's nothing I did? No. It's definitely nothing you did. Good. So, you want to run with me? Sure. What do you want to do? Like, three miles? I was thinking five. If you can handle it. Race you to the corner. Okay. Oh! You are seriously fast. Maybe we should draft you for next season. Oh, I'm not a big fan of shoulder pads. Enough said. What's this for? Nothing. I just thought you'd like it. It's no biggie. Oh. Okay. Well, thanks. It's weird. You're so easy to talk to. It's like... What? It's like we were already friends before we met. Does that make any sense? Never mind. It's crazy. No. No. I thought the same thing. But I don't really know anything about you. Well, what do you want to know? What do you want to do with your life? I don't know. I'll probably end up doing something in law. I'm really big on fairness. I just... I can't stand people who think they can get away with doing something they know is wrong. Like what? Like people who cut in line. Seriously, they shouldn't even get what they want if they cut. What, so if you're in line for a movie and I just got my ticket, and as I'm on my way to the very, very back of the line, I see you. Can I get in line with you? Nope. Wow. You're tough. Tough but fair. When I go into politics, that's how I want to be. Is that what you want to do? Be a politician? Not "a" politician. "The" politician. I'm thinking President of the United States. Whoa. Yeah, I know, it's crazy to even joke about it, right? No. I can totally see it. Race you back to school. You're on. Hey! No shortcuts. Why not? We're number one, you're number two. We're gonna beat the socks off of you. No one thought it was possible, but the Crusaders have just tied the game up. Yeah! We're even at 14, late in the fourth quarter. Ready? Let's give them something to think about on the bus ride home. Fake 26, on one. Ready? Uh-oh. What? That's gonna hurt. Ready! Down! Let's go, Will! Let's go, Will! 15, 36, set, hut! Wagner dropping back. What a hit! Intercepted at the 40-yard line. He's at the ten, the five... Touchdown Crusaders. I can't believe it. Will, you okay? Dude, where was your block? You left him wide open! I know, okay? I messed up! What were you thinking? I'm sorry. What was so important you couldn't keep your mind on the game? I get it if you hate me. You should hate me. I don't hate you. Just do your job, okay? Make the stupid block. Whatever you say, Your Highness. Did Lance just bow at Will? I don't know. The only chance the Knights have now, is for the defense to block the extra point and run it back for a TD. Hold that line. Defense, one more time. Go, Knights, hold that line. Defense, one more time. So much for State. Hey, guys, come on. Believe in it. We can still make it if we beat Northgate. Yeah, right. The extra point is good. We can't beat a bunch of eighth graders the way we're playing. No one thought it was possible, but the Knights have been upset by the Crusaders. With this loss, Will Wagner and his teammates have to beat the undefeated Dragons next week if they want a ticket to the State. Will. Are you okay? Not really. I'm pretty sure Lance let me get sacked on purpose. Like he wanted me to get hurt. But then, why would he do that? Here's the thing. And this isn't easy. I just... Hey there, superstar. Way to take a hit like a girl. Bet the scouts loved that. Dude, get out of here. Can't. Your dad said you'd give me a lift. Can I call you later? You can finish what you were going to tell me? It's nothing. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. I'll be fine. Thanks, Allie. Really. Miles! What are you doing here? You need help. How do you know I need help? I just know, okay? Isn't that enough? No, actually, it's not enough. How do you always know things are going to happen before it happens? Like the shoelaces, the ice, the stuff at the football game, showing up here tonight. I think you even knew about Jen and Lance before I did! What are you, psychic or something? Don't say that word, Allie. It's okay, Miles. You can tell me. No, I can't. I can't tell anyone. I'm not just anyone. I'm your friend. If you tell me something, no matter what it is, I'm going to be there for you. Because that's what friends do. I just... I'm already enough of a nerd, Allie. The last thing I need is something else making me different. Sometimes being different is what makes us great. Okay. So, I've been seeing things, like flashes of the future, ever since I was a little kid. Only now it's gotten stronger. Now it feels like I'm being hit in the head with a brick. And tonight? What happened to make you come here tonight? I saw myself sitting here with you, readinthe book. Book? What book? The Order of the Bear journal. It has a secret page. Watch out. I've been through this book, like, a million times. I never saw this. Thanks, Miles. "The King returns anew at the meeting of the moon's shadowing "and a million falling stars. " What the heck does that mean? Maybe the moon's shadowing is an eclipse? And a million falling stars... A meteor shower? That's it! A meteor shower. So maybe King Arthur's return is when an eclipse and a meteor shower happens on the same day. No. It can't be. That only happens, like, once every 1,000 years. Oh. Hold on. Total eclipse, meteor shower. Okay, so it looks like every 1,000 years is next Friday. The night of the big game? No, no. It can't be. Maybe I read it wrong. Let me see. It's right here, in plain English! Eclipse! Meteor shower! Same day! Arthur is coming back. Arthur is coming back. "Beware Mordred, Arthur's half-brother and sworn enemy, "who is tasked to destroy Arthur "before he even knows himself to be a King. " "Destroy Arthur"? As in, permanently? Dad, quick King Arthur question for you. It's for our research paper. Shoot. Okay. Say King Arthur did come back, and Mordred came back to destroy him. What would he do? Well, the legend said that Mordred would try to make Arthur's perfect world fall apart. He would try to make Arthur lose faith in himself and his destiny, and he would cause infighting amongst Arthur's knights. And he would try to crush Arthur's spirit so completely, he would lose the will to go on. Nice guy. I don't know how Mordred would do it today, but 1,500 years ago, he did it by telling Arthur that his wife Guinevere was in love with Lancelot. Arthur was so upset and betrayed... He lost all faith, he didn't have the strength to go on. I know. What is it, honey? What you just said? It's happening. It's Will. Will is the reincarnation of King Arthur. I told you, Paul! It's really him! I knew it! I told you we were right to move here! Whoa, whoa! Wait. We moved here because of the prophecy? Um, a little bit. And you already knew it was Will? I had a hunch, which you just confirmed. Of course, we won't know for sure until he wields Excalibur. Oh. And where is he supposed to get that? It says here, any sword in King Arthur's hand becomes Excalibur. Pardon? Any sword in King Arthur's hand becomes Excalibur. I know. But I thought it was cool. Very cool. Now we just have to keep an eye out for Mordred. Oh, stop. This is ridiculous. Even if this were real, which it isn't, if Mordred were here, it'd be very hard to spot him. Unless, of course, Will has an evil stepbrother. I was kidding. Will has an evil stepbrother? Evil doesn't even begin to describe Marco. I need to do some research. So that's why Marco, I mean, Mordred, didn't want me to tell Will about Jen and Lance! He wanted to be the one to ruin Will's life! Joan! I need you! I need the book about the thing. Don't worry, sweetie, we'll do some more research, and do everything we can to help Will stay strong. Now would be good. You know what? We don't have time for more research. We have to tell Will so he can defend himself. Oh, yeah, that'll be great. "Will, you're the reincarnation of King Arthur, "your step-brother is Mordred, "and he's going to try and destroy you. "Are you gonna eat those fries?" Hmm. Yeah, it's a little out there, isn't it? Yeah, we passed out there about five exits back. Maybe we should wait until we can do it without freaking him out. Good call. Yeah. But what if Marco tells him about Jen and Lance before that? Like your mom said, that's Mordred's biggest weapon. He won't use it until he's sure it's the final blow. I hope you're right. Of course I'm... Miles? Miles! Wake up! Say something! You could really look into a breath mint. Did you have a vision? Yeah. I think I saw Excalibur, but... Where was it? What did it look like? Well, if I saw what I think I saw, then... It was pretty awesome. You know, if Will is Arthur, and Marco is Mordred, maybe you're Merlin the wizard. Merlin was a psychic. Doubtful. Merlin had a long, white beard. I can barely grow a nose hair. Drool much? You're just jealous. But then again, you have been for centuries. Okay, hurry up. This is your final test on King Arthur. Thank you. Thank you. And you have exactly 45 minutes. Begin. What is that on the bottom of your shoe? Give it to me. Looks like a cheat sheet. That is not mine. So, what, it just adhered itself perfectly to the bottom of your shoe all by itself? No. Don't lie to me, Mr. Wagner. How could... I expect more from you than this. Dude, if you get caught cheating, you're out of the game on Friday. Mr. Moore, you have to believe me! I did not cheat! Because of your spotless record and service to the school, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt. This time. Thank you. Sit down. Special treatment. Quiet. Back to your tests. I know it was you who planted that cheat sheet, Marco. You don't know anything. I know more than you think. Wagner, it'll be a 28 sweep on two. Yes, Coach. All right. Everyone know the new play? We don't need to. We have cheat sheets. Funny. Ready. 28 sweep on two. Ready? Ready. Ready. Down. 20, 45, hut! Hut! Hut! Hey, hey, hey, hey! What do you think you're doing? Target practice. Apologize. Why? He didn't get hurt. Doesn't matter. I'm sick of some of you guys acting like you own the field. Come on, Will. Just leave it alone. No! I'm the team captain, and I'm not happy about this. Maybe we should find a new captain. One with a sense of humor. Or maybe one who doesn't cheat on tests. Yeah. That's right. Hey. Thanks for what you did out there. It was about time someone told that guy off. Yeah, well, I'm glad someone thinks I did something right today. You stood up for yourself in class, you stood up for us out here. It takes a lot of courage to do what you do, and you do it all the time. Maybe I should just start being a jerk, then no one will expect anything from me. You are constitutionally incapable of being a jerk. You know who else was brave like that? Who stood up for people? King... Sorry. There's something I've got to try to do. But we'll have to talk later today, okay? Okay. So, see you. See you. Okay. Got it? Sure? Off you go. Yes. Yes. Oh! Whoa. Sorry. Sorry, Mr. Moore. My mind is somewhere else. Will Wagner has that effect on people. How did you know I was talking about Will? Not that I was. I wasn't. Okay. I was. I understand. He's a special young man. You have no idea. I wish... Yes? Mr. Moore, if I tell you something, you can't tell anyone. Okay? Whatever it is, you have my word it'll be between us. Allie, what's on your mind? It's about the book, The Order of the Bear? Oh, no, I didn't leave a coffee ring on it, did I? No, no. It's fine. The thing is, we found a secret page. And it said... You're probably not going to believe this, but it said the return of King Arthur is happening now. And I think that... You think it's Will. How did you know? I've had my suspicions. If anyone at this school is the reincarnation of King Arthur, it's Will Wagner. Amazing, isn't it? King Arthur walking the halls of Avalon High? Then does that mean you'll help me protect Will from Mordred? Of course. And I assume you have a guess as to who that is as well? I don't think it's too hard to figure out. I suppose not. Don't worry, Allie. When the day comes for Arthur to rise again, Marco won't stand in anyone's way. Today, we're going to see if we can create a small but safe chemical reaction. Now follow the instructions on the board. Fire up those burners. Stop staring. Okay, everyone, add the sodium hydroxide. Ah! Wait! This beaker's been tampered with! Miles, I prepared all the solutions myself. They're fine. See? So much for Merlin. Allie? Everybody, duck! Is anyone hurt? Allie! Miles! Are you okay? Stop, everyone, what you're doing! I want you both to go and sethe nurse. I don't know what happened here, but something is very, very wrong. Are you okay? You really should be more careful. Sometimes when you get too close to something you shouldn't, you get burned. Okay, this is starting to get really scary. I'm not scared anymore, Miles. I'm mad. I'm gonna find Will after school and tell him everything. He's going to think you're out of your mind. It doesn't matter. He deserves to know before the eclipse tonight. Any chance you're getting a vision of how it goes? Am I doubled over, clutching my head in excruciating pain? No. Well, there you go, then. Hey, Will! Have a good game, man! Yo, Will! Will! Will! Will! Where's Will? You know what's going on? He's really upset. He kind of saw me and Jen together. Wagner here yet? Not yet, Coach. Well, we're toast. Nice pep talk. Hey! Not one word out of you, Benwick. Not one word. Will! No! Allie! Allie! Are you okay? Please, you have to be okay! Hey. Are you hurt? Can you move everything? I'm fine. What happened? How did you fall? I was pushed. What? Who would push you? Mordred. From the King Arthur story? Yes! Okay, lie down. I think you hit your head. No, Will, I have to tell you something, and you might not believe me, but it's true. I know already. You... You do? Yeah. About Lance and Jen. I saw them. No, I know. And that's part of the story, but there's so much more to it. I don't need to hear the details. Really. I'm okay. Come on. No, Will, listen to me. This isn't just about Lance and Jen. This is about fate. This is about your destiny. You aren't just Will Wagner. You're King Arthur. And today is the day that you rise above all the lies and the backstabbing and the self-doubt and start back on the path to changing the world. You're the one everyone's been waiting for. Allie! You're right. Today, I am like King Arthur. I have to be a leader. I have to face adversity and overcome it. What? Yeah, it's a metaphor. I get it. I'm the team captain, I can't leave my teammates behind. Hey, Miles, can you give Allie a ride? Yeah, sure. You're the reason the Knights are going to be united again. See you after the game. I gotta go! Will! No! I didn't say you were like King Arthur, I said you are King Arthur! And I still have to warn you about Marco! Marco is Mordred! Now what? We have to go to the game and not let Will out of our sight. Ten-hut! And another fumble by the backup quarterback, and everyone is asking the same question, where is Will Wagner? Wait a minute. It looks like Wagner has showed up. Hey, Coach. Can I get a time-out? Time-out, Knights. Nice of you to show up, Wagner. I shouldn't even let you on the field. I'm sorry, Coach. Now give me a long pass, huh? Hey, guys, I'm sorry. But I'm here, and I won't let you down, I promise. So come on, let's get back out there. Guys, come on! Come on, let's go. Five, six, seven, eight. Knights! That's right! Come on, team, let's fight! Well, maybe we were wrong. Maybe it's not tonight. Ready. Okay, focus. Play has stopped, and here it comes, folks, right on schedule. Or not. A lunar eclipse and a meteor shower at the same time. Wow! Okay, focus. Let's get on the board before halftime. Deep ball to right. On one. Ready! Yeah! Go, Knights! Whoo! We're number one! Ready! Down! Set! Hut! Oh, Wagner gets slammed! It almost looks like one of his linemen missed a block on purpose. That's for not showing up. Hey, that was a cheap shot! And now the Knights are turning on each other. If you're an Avalon High fan, this is tough to watch. Is Mordred making them act like this? No, I don't think so. I think this is real. The Knights need to pull it together at halftime, or their season's over. Not now, Jen. Will. Will, I'm sorry, man. It's all my fault. I didn't know how to tell you. You made a fool out of me, Lance. I know. I did it all wrong. I don't want to lose you as my best friend. We're like the Knights of the Round Table. We're brothers. I'll break up with her. Don't. You don't mean that. Truth is, Jen and I haven't been close for a long time. If you guys are happy, I'm okay with that. So, we cool? We're cool. Hey, Coach? Yeah? Can I say something? Yeah. Go ahead. Come on, boys, get it in. Come on! Guys, I know that for a while we lost our way as a team, but we can get it back. All we have to do is remember what victory felt like, remember what triumph meant to all of us. Remember who we were. 'Cause we're that same team now. And if we believe that, nothg can stop us on our way to glory! So, who are we? Knights, united, will never be divided! Knights! Come on! Let's go get 'em! Will, please forgive me, I... It's okay, Jen. And with the Dragons leading 27-nothing, here come the Knights, hoping to mount an improbable comeback. Hey, Allie. Thanks again for what you said before. You really helped me inspire the guys. Yeah, okay. Listen. Oh, man, I forgot my helmet. I'll see you after the game. I promise. We have a lot to talk about. But we have a lot to talk about now! The Dragons have never lost this season when they were ahead at the half. Great. Fight, fight, fight! Fight, fight, fight! Hey, Allie, where's Will? He just went to go get his helmet. People are asking where he is. He's got to get out here. Everyone thinks he's losing it. It's all my fault. Pretty much. All right, okay. We'll go find him. We'll go find him! Yeah, and meanwhile, try not to lose the game. No sign of Will in there. I need you to concentrate. Just tell me where he is. I told you, I can't just make it happen on demand. Yes, you can, Miles. I know you can do it. It hurts, Allie. I know. He's in the school theater. With Marco. Marco, where's Will? Will! Allie! What has Marco done to you? Marco? He was trying to warn me. No, Marco is Mordred. He's trying to destroy you before you figure out who you really are. What? What I told you tonight, it's not a metaphor. Your destiny is to change the world. You are King Arthur. You should listen to Allie, Mr. Wagner. Mr. Moore? She's absolutely right, about everything. Except for one small detail. Marco... Marco's not Mordred. Oh, no, no, no, no. I am. No, it's not possible. You can't be. Ta-da! Surpriue ending. That was really cool. You okay, Will? Yeah, I think so. Wait. This doesn't make any sense. You've been trying to destroy Will. No, I've been protecting him. Look, my father was in the Order of the Bear, and when he died, I swore to continue on. What about all the terrible things you did? I needed to get Mr. Moore, Mordred, to trust me. Allie, you were right. Will is Arthur and Miles is Merlin. I am? Really? Cool. I want you to know that treating you guys the way I did was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. But I only did it to keep you away from Will and out of danger. Sorry for all the things I did to you. What are you talking about? Okay, let's just... Let's get out of here. Enough! I was just going to try to destroy you, Arthur, by simply crushing your spirit, but I can see now that I'm going to have to take care of you, all of you, the old-fashioned way. Starting with this pest! Don't touch her! Come on, Allie. I guess I won't be getting that A. Stay away from him! Do you really think a silly toy sword is going to stop me? What's happening? Any sword in the hands of Arthur becomes Excalibur. No. It's not possible. It was you all along, Allie. You're King Arthur. I... I am? I am. I am King Arthur! Allie! Behind you! Ah! Impossible! I thought maybe you could be the Lady of the Lake. Maybe. But King Arthur? King Arthur can't be a girl! And yet, here we are. Ah! Miles! His staff! It's yours! To the owner the staff return! The evil hand that holds it, burn! Take it! Whoa. Being Merlin rules! Don't even think about it. Hey! It's after hours. No one's supposed to be in here. Officer! Arrest that girl. She brought a weapon to school. Threatened the life of a school teacher. Good luck saving the world from juvie, Your Highness. I'm sorry, sir, are you saying this girl was threatening you with a plastic sword? No, no, you oaf! With a real sword. This... All right, no. This is a plastic sword, but it was a real sword. 'Cause she held it and it became... Whoosh! Excalibur! Because she is King Arthur! And... Look, who's the teacher here? We just came in to get some fake armor for the school mascot, Officer. Yeah, I have no idea what Mr. Moore is talking about. And I'm a National Merit Scholar. I don't kidnap teachers. I suck up to them. Wagner, shouldn't you be on the field? Yes, sir. I should be. Get out there and get us to State. We really need to talk. Yeah. Later. Right now, you have a game to win. Go! Okay, okay, come on. No! No! Okay, buddy. The Captain's gonna love this nutbar. No! No, King Arthur cannot be allowed to live on! I have to destroy her! It's my destiny! It's my destiny! We did it. We stopped Mordred. Oh, no. I just thought of something. What? What if this is just another one of my crazy King Arthur dreams, and in two minutes, I wake up in my bedroom? It's not a dream, Allie. You're King Arthur. And I'm Merlin. Check this out. Cool, huh? Let's get out of here. Wait. Thank you, Your Highness. Oh, wow, that's... Yeah, the bowing's going to take some getting used to. It's time-out for the Knights as Will Wagner comes back in as quarterback, trailing with just 12 seconds on the clock. Ready! Blast! 26, on one. Fight! That's right! Come on, team, let's fight! Hey there. Hey! Cool pen. Thanks! Cool hair. Thanks. Bye. Go, Will! I don't understand it. The eclipse came and went, and no Arthur, no Mordred, no great battle. I told you not to get your hopes up. But I was so sure it was Will. I know. You even had me believing it for a second there. I guess we'll never find Arthur. Five, six, seven, eight. AL Touchdown, touchdown, we want a touchdown! Ready! Down! Set! Hut! Wagner drops back, fakes left, and he's running it! Here comes a tackle, and oh, my! Wagner just hurdled right over him! Look at that speed! And yes, no one can touch Wagner now. He's going to do it! Touchdown, Knights! Yeah! They defeated the Dragons, 36-35. They're going to State! Yeah! Yeah! We're going to State! Knights! Knights! Knights! They're treating him like he's King Arthur. They have no idea. It's okay. I feel like I'm up there with him. Quick, Allie, lip gloss! Why... Wait. If you're the reincarnation of King Arthur, what does that make me? My knight in shining armor. Hey, Marco. Come eat with us.
