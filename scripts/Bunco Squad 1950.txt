There's an abundance of evidence in the Police files that .. Palm-reading and mind-reading and the like are... rackets. And the so-called wheels-of-fortune are .. Always manipulated by the operator to bilk his victim. And yet I don't imagine there is one of you here who hasn't lost .. Money on at least one of these Bunco games at some time in your life. The doorway peddler usually starts by saying, uh .. He found what he has for sale when it fell off a delivery truck. He always says he doesn't know the value of what he has and asks what you'll offer. The fur is genuine mink, and the victim knows it. His instant thought is take advantage of the peddler's ignorance. That's when he falls into the trap. The sale is made... and the peddler helpfully provides a bag. And wonders if anyone is coming. The victim obligingly turns his back and the Bunco man makes the switch. You can now see why the Bunco artists are responsible for the expression - "Left holding the bag." Now you people make the law, and you should help your Police enforce it. As you know, I represent a section of the Police Department called the "Bunco Squad". It's our job to help you. So won't you please help us. Thank you. Steve, Steve! Captain Edwards wants us right away. I'm sorry folks. Excuse me. Thanks for getting me off the hook. Hey it's on the level. We're wanted down at headquarters. You know Rand of Homicide? Sure. How are you Rand? This came from covering a suicide at the Gaymar hotel. A retired mid-western banker by the name of Burke. He got taken for his life-savings and a phony stock deal. Going over some of his belongings I came across these magazines about horoscopes .. Astrology and fortune-telling. I thought it might be an angle for the Bunco Squad. Well, if I can be any further help .. Thanks Ray. See you later. This suicide is the third tragedy caused by a swindler in the last 3 months. You know, people come out here to retire, spend a vacation .. And they get taken by these con-men and Bunco artists. Every time this happens, the newspapers and the public raise a howl. Do you suppose he was steered into this by a fortune-teller? We've certainly got all kinds out here. I'm not sure, but this looks like the work of a big-time operator. So far he's been smart enough to cover up his tracks. But they all need an organization. The stooges, the shills and the rest. If the real brains is using any of the phonies we have here in Los Angeles .. That's the way we'll get to him. I want you to case every faker in town. If it looks suspicious, pull him in. Warn them we mean business. Never forget, it's the head man we're after. I don't know who, or where, he is. But I do know one thing. He's out there... some place. It was very nice meeting you Barbara. Will I see you again? I certainly hope so Tony. How about dinner tonight? Oh I don't think we should until she .. Oh yes, of course. Say in week or so? Will you call me? Mrs Royce, may I express my deepest sympathies. Thank you Mr Wells. Hello Fred. Hello Tony. Could you put the bags in the back, please. Yes sir. Did you have a good trip? Very interesting. Did you hear about our friend, Burt? Yes, suicide huh? That's too bad. Yeah, too bad. Who are those women? Oh that's a Mrs Jessica Royce, a widow with two million dollars. And a very charming secretary who happens to be penniless and lonesome. Who are you interested in? Both of them. It's been a wonderful day, Tony. Won't you change your mind and have dinner with me tonight? Oh you forget. I'm a working girl. Is Mrs Royce complaining about my taking up too much of your time? Oh no. Neither have I. Hello Barbara, I'm glad you're back. Oh Mrs Royce, this is Tony Mr Wells, the gentleman we met on the train. How do you do Mrs Royce. Nice to see you again. You're looking extremely well. I'm feeling very much better thank you. Did you want me for something Mrs Royce? Just a few letters dear, there's no hurry. Would you excuse me. Surely. I have to be going myself. Just a few weeks ago, she was the most grief-stricken woman I've ever known. What's happened to cause this extraordinary change? The gentleman who just left. Dr Largo is responsible. Dr Largo? He must be a remarkable physician. Is he a specialist? Actually, he's neither a physician nor a specialist. I believe he's called a Consulting Psychologist. Consulting Psychologist? Two visits a week. She never makes a move without him. Surely she doesn't believe that that sort of .. Completely! But as long as she's happy, I don't care what she believes in. I must go Tony, thanks again. Call me soon. Real soon. This is fine way to track down a big-time Bunco operator. You got any better ideas? If I have to talk to one more phony fortune-teller .. Your future looks very gloomy. The cards are not bright. Yeah, well I've got news for you sister. Your future don't look so bright either. I see bars, and you behind them. Very sorry... do not understand. My English is not very good. You'll catch on when you talk to the Judge. 30 days is 30 days in any language .. Why don't you lay off. You guys got nothing on me. I'm running a clean place. See .. See that you keep it that way. Got a lot of class, hasn't she. And so you see gentlemen. The power of numbers has had a great influence on men. Most of their lives. Lay off will you. This is the oldest numbers racket in the world, and you know it. Numerology sir, is a great science. Okay Professor, but remember, one complaint .. And we'll introduce you to the science of making little ones out of big ones. But Grace, I've been busy. Well, you now... work. Oh but .. But Grace .. Keep quiet Steve... just hold on. Honey... are you alright? Cut! Steve? Of course I'm alright. That was just a scene from the picture I'm working in. Cut it short, will you. I've got to go... I'll pick you up tonight. That's the trouble with being a cop. You've have a legitimate excuse for your wife, but they don't believe you anyhow. I don't know about you, but win or lose, I'm taking Grace for dinner tonight. Who's next? Annie Cobb. I thought she was still writing for the San Quentin Times. Just a warning Annie. Don't too clever with your customer's signatures. We don't want them showing up on forged checks. My profession is to judge a man's character by his handwriting. Especially when the letters turn up in court. Which is where we'll see you Annie if you get ambitious. Buffalo Bill. Hello. Hello dearie. The badge-boys are on a sightseeing tour. Thanks Annie, I have a client waiting. Bye. I'm sorry Miss Dilby, but we can do no more today. I just can't go on. But you were telling me .. When I am forced to come out of a trance, my powers are always weak. We'll try again at your regular time next Monday. I'll be looking forward to it. I am so anxious to know about Arthur. Come in Sgt Johnson, Sgt McManus. She's psychic. Yeah, especially when the law's around. Twenty bucks your regular fee, Liane? I have no fee. I accept only goodwill offerings. Did you gentlemen wish something? Just wanted to tell you not to steer your clients into any phony deals. Oh, I never advise my clients. I only tell them what I see in the crystal ball. You tried that excuse on a Denver Judge and got three years. Or have you forgotten? Is this a pitch? No... just a warning. You boys don't have to worry about me. Goodbye. I wouldn't mind going into a trance with her myself. If I wasn't married of course. Come in. Hello Princess. Been a long time, hasn't it? Not long enough Mr Weldon. Uhuh. Not Weldon. The name is Wells. Anthony Wells. What will it be tomorrow? Do me a favor Mr Anthony Wells... blow! Liane, I'm terribly sorry about that little unpleasantness. The time you had to go to prison. You'll not that make friends and influence people by discussing prison .. With someone who's recently been in one. Especially since you should have been there too. I said I was sorry. Don't be. The prison diet agreed with me. Everybody says I have a lovely figure now. Goodbye. Well... I see you've finally made the big league. Crooning over a crystal-ball, huh? Playing around for peanuts in a dingy walk-up I make a living. Oh, you're not really satisfied with nickels and dimes. you deserve much better. Listen, do you know what I could do for you? Alright, spill it. Let's stop kidding each other. I need your special talents. I have a proposition that's worth a great deal of money. Are you interested? How much is a great deal? Sit down. Two million dollars. Alright... let's hear about it. Good evening sir.  Table for two please. Right this way, sir. Say, what about the booth in the corner? Surely. May I start you with a cocktail? Yeah, a couple of Martinis... very dry. Thank you sir. Do you realize this is the first date you haven't broken in the past two weeks? But what about all the dates you broke, because of your "career"? Are you still jealous of my career? Oh, how could I be? The last time I went to see you in a picture, I went out for popcorn .. And missed your entire performance. Grace, honey. If I can crack this case, I'm a cinch for promotion. Your salary has nothing to do with our getting married, If that's what you're driving at. Oh I see. You... you haven't time for marriage right now. There's something in you that has to come out. You have to express yourself. What's the use, it's .. It's just that creative people have to .. Well, they have to create, that's all. Oh, that will look great in print. Yeah, I can see it all now: "Grace Bradshaw, rising young screen-star says, quote..." "Creative people have to create." Unquote. Thank you. Advice on love, business and personal problems? Maybe we ought to ask the Swami? That's all I need. Will set back my promotion ten years. Swami Kohlikhan. His real name is Drake. Strictly a phony. He's over there. Well, get a load of that, will you. One faker having her fortune told by another. Now I've seen everything. The change will be very soon. Very soon... now? Hey, what do you know? Drake's leaving with her. Maybe they have a date? Is that illegal? No. But I bet what they're thinking about is. Now that you've seen the place, let's get down to business. Our organization will be known as the "Rama Society". R-A-M-A. Devoted to the science of the occult. Liane here will be in charge. You'll address her as "The Princess". Where are you going to be? Reed will know where to contact me. What about the scenery? We're going to have to dress this place up a little. It's on its way. Any suckers that you trim are your own affair. I'm only interested in Mrs Jessica Royce. Do you understand? And Drake... I want you to be extremely careful. What's the next move? I have all the information I need on Mrs Royce but not enough on her son. So all of you get busy. We already have competition. Who? I'll tell you later. Just a minute Tony You haven't answered my question. Where are you going to be? Don't worry about me.  I'm not worried about you. If anything goes wrong, I'm not going to stand by and take another rap for you. Oh, I'm so sorry. Aren't you a maid at the Royce home? Yes. Oh that poor woman. I read when they finally brought her son's body home. The paper said such nice things about him. And he deserved them. He was such a wonderful boy. Oh, you knew him?  I was his governess. He was such a little doll. I can remember as if it was only yesterday. The first time he tried to say his mother's name. He couldn't say "Jessica". All he could say was "Sicca". He was so cute. No, that section is not for sale. That belongs to Jessica Royce. Jessica Royce? Oh she must be the woman who's son came home with some war decorations? Mmm, that's right. That's Philip. When he was killed at Normandy, a lot of us felt like we'd lost a boy of our own. Sounds like he was a fine chap. Oh he was. I remembered about the time he started to go to school. He... he used to ride his bike down that hill right out there. He hit a train once, and he wouldn't let his mother watch the Doc's sew him up. He said it would hurt her worse than it hurt him. And then I remember another time. The day we heard he'd been killed we felt as sad as if we'd known him personally. Oh... then you really didn't know Phillip Royce? No, but Mrs Royce was so proud of him, she told us everything he'd ever done. Like the story of his first allowance. He spent it buying ice-cream for the neighborhood kids. He told his mother that being happy by yourself was no fun. So he just bought a lot of happiness and spread it around. Then another time he .. Fine... good work. You have more information on Mrs Royce and her son than she knows herself. How do we steer her into coming here? What about the competition you said we had? I'm working on both those items. Our competition is Dr Largo. Dr Largo? Who's he? Well, here he's know as a Consulting Psychologist. In Cincinnati, St Louis and Points West, he uses the name of Mike Finlayson. The only psychology Mike Finlayson knows, is how to evade the Police. And Jessica Royce is one of his best patients. And he'll never let you take a sucker away from him. You're right Annie... that's where you come in Reed. Well Largo doesn't know you. You're going to become a patient of Dr Largo. Hello Doctor. I'm very glad you were able to see me so quickly. Sometimes, mental distress is more vital to our well-being than physical ailments. I'm glad you appreciate that fact Doctor. I know that what I'm about to say will cause you considerable mental distress. Oh, I'm used to hearing all sorts of problems. My problem concerns a patient of yours. Jessica Royce. I'm sorry Mr Reed, but I make it a practice never to discuss .. Alright Doc... I'd much rather discuss a man named Mike Finlayson. Alias Benjamin Lazetti. Alias Dr Largo. Prison terms in Cincinnati and Cleveland. Shall I continue? No... no. That's enough. What do you want? All I want you to do is to send Mrs Royce to one of our meetings. And if I refuse? Don't forget the address, and make it soon. Tomorrow will be fine. Yes Doctor? Call Mrs Royce. You don't believe in this? You mustn't be so skeptical Barbara. Anything that Dr Largo recommends must be .. Won't you come in please. I'm Mrs .. No names are given here, except in the sanctity of the Sance Room. This way please. In the world of the occult, we are advancing onward. As in all other branches of science. Mysterious powers and secrets that have long been lost, are being rediscovered. Princess Liane is gifted with powers which enable her to penetrate .. That land of mystery which lies beyond material life .. And yet is all about us. As you presently will witness. Please .. Do you think she can contact, or I mean, get in touch with the dead? "Dead". ... We do not recognize that word here. Our loved ones are in another world, as much alive as you and I. If you believe that man has a soul, then you must believe in Princess Liane. Spirits of the outer world were... they are, and they shall be. Oh Rama... you are the gate to the outer world. Our past, present and future. All are one... oh Rama. Open the gate to me. Ahko! be my guide. We are not alone. I feel the presence of beings great and good. We come in friendship... in love. Fear us not. But make your presence known. I feel a cold breeze. It's a sign. They are here. Look! The candles. Oh wonders of the great terrestrial plane. Speak to us... I implore you. "Even as you implore, so do we answer." Who are you? "We are the multitude, that together, make the spirit which put you forth." There's someone bearing a message for... Mary. John? "Mary... do not weep. You've been sad long enough." "You know that by your love, you can enter into communion with me." Oh John! "My message is as before." "Let happiness fill your heart... enjoy it. And grow with love." Did you see it? Hear? Maybe Phillip?  No, Mrs Royce, don't. Shhh. You'll disturb them. "Robert?" Alice? "Oh Robert, my new world is so friendly." "Stop! Let me alone." Alice, what's wrong? "Someone is pulling me back... away from you." Why do you force your way in here? Who are you? ... Speak. Let the spirits speak. "Sicca... Sicca." Phillip. Let the spirits speak .. "Sicca... Sicca." Phillip, come back! Barbara, it was Phillip. I know. When he was a boy .. Mrs Royce, it was just a trick. It couldn't be. He called me "Sicca". That was his name for me when he was a child. You should never cry out at a sance. You might harm Princess Liane. Oh Princess, I'm so sorry. Forgive me. I didn't realize what I was doing. An unexpected message is always a shock. Was it... was it someone you knew? It was my son, Phillip. He tried so hard to reach you. I cannot understand why he did not stay. Oh! ... it was you. You do not believe. No! We... we're accustomed to that. The presence of an unbeliever, often prevents a manifestation. Barbara, will you wait for me in the car. I'll be right out. Excuse me please. It's been a strain. I want to see her again. I must. The Princess will be happy to have you return. Our next service is on Wednesday. Do I have to wait until next week? But the sign outside mentions private sittings. Yes, private sittings may be arranged. Is that what you wish? Oh, by all means... tomorrow? Tomorrow at two?  Oh, thank you very much. I'm Mrs Jessica Royce. Mrs Jessica Royce. At two. Oh, I forgot... What...? How do I pay for this? There is no fee. Our Society is supported entirely by love-offerings from friends. In the words of Rama "freely we give, freely we receive." Thank you. Goodnight Mrs Royce. What do you think of this, chief? I was making my rounds and found we lost a customer. Annie Cobb's gone. She left a form to sign, but no forwarding address. I'd better call Liane. She and Annie were pals. Maybe she'd know. Get me Dunkirk, 2,1,1,9,9. Right now, I want to know what happened to all those phonies. What? Thank you... disconnected. Disconnected? Liane's quit too. Maybe the warning we gave them scared them off? A routine talk never scared those two. I'm getting curious. You'd better follow this up. Drake! ... Liane and Drake. Where to? We're going to see Drake. I'd rather see Liane. Thank you Madame. Hi boys. Hi Swinson. What happened to Drake? Don't ask me. The job was open, so I took it. When did you start? Yesterday. When Drake quit. That makes three of them now. You boys got a problem? Maybe if I read your palm .. You just keep your own palm clean and we'll try to forget you're in town. First Annie Cobb, then Liane, now Drake. Put three small racketeers together and what have you got? One big one. You're brilliant. Thanks. Now all we have to do is find them. Ever see this guy before? No. How about this girl? No. How about this one? No. Well, so long Joe. So long. Cut... okay... print. Lunch. Hi. Hi, honey. You know it isn't every man can lure a young lady away from a movie set. Why, I didn't know you detectives took time to have lunch. For all the detecting I've done in the last few days, I could take all day for lunch. No luck yet, huh? Not a sign of any of them. How's everything with you? Oh, I spoke my three lines this morning and took four steps backward in my career. Good. Maybe I can interest you in a little more talk about career versus marriage? I warn you my resistance is very low today. Well, they tell me the best time to propose to a woman is in broad daylight. Then she's got to believe you. Well, what are we waiting for? "Car 404. Calling car 404." Steve Johnson... yeah? Hillcrest Cleaners on Westwood Boulevard, between Santa Monica and Picault. Right. The laundry is ready to be picked up any time after one o'clock today. Got it. They traced Liane's laundry ticket. And you to go to Hillcrest Cleaners on Westward Boulevard right away. That's right. Goodbye darling. I knew it. I knew it. I'll take a rain-check on that proposal. Thank you. Well... real highbrow stuff, huh? Hey! What can I do for you, sir? Who are you? I'm Frederick Green. You, sir? Police. Everyone is welcome here. Whom do you wish to see? Liane. You mean Princess Liane? Okay, Princess Liane. Where is she? Princess Liane, this gentleman wishes .. He doesn't need an introduction. We've met before. Often. Hello Steve. Well, looks like old-home week. Something on your mind, Sergeant? Yeah... the Rama Society. The Rama Society is a religious organization. Supported solely by love-offerings. Which is entirely within the law. Well, you certainly know all the angles. You in charge here?  Princess Liane is our leader. You? Who are you trying to kid? The three of you never had enough cash for a layout like this. Which brings me back to you again. I just work here. With who's check-book? Mr Johnson, your intrusion into a private home is unpardonable. So unless you have a warrant .. Oh, now you're not going to get technical, are you? Show him out. Never mind, never mind. I'll find my way out. After you. This way, please. What's up? We had a visitor from the Bunco Squad. Anything wrong? No, but Mrs Royce showed up as the Cop left. He took her license number. I warned you that if anything went wrong .. The cop didn't tell me he was coming. It isn't my fault he knows Liane, Drake and Annie. You picked them. This deal is going through and nobody is going to mess it up. You stay with him. Okay. Hello Traffic... Steve Johnson. Hey, what did you find on that license number, Mike? Who? What address? Right... get a load of this, will you. Jessica Royce. She on her finals? No. She's in "Who's Who." And worth plenty. Better have a talk with her. Right. See you Mac. Bye. But you've got to believe me. I have definite proof that Princess Liane... Has been in prison. Is that what you were going to say, Mr Johnson? And that her friends Mrs Cobb and Mr Drake also have Police records? Well, if you already know, there's no point .. I do. Princess Liane told me. She told you? She told me of her mistakes in the past. Of how she prayed for forgiveness in her prison cell. And as, if in answer to prayer she discovered her strange psychic power. Well, certainly you don't believe that Mrs Royce? My belief in Princess Liane is complete and unquestioning. Nothing you can say can shake my faith in her... or the Rama Society. They're helping me. And they're helping themselves to your money. I have made one contribute of $50 which the Society refused to accept. They refused money? ... Well this is a new switch. I understand you have your duty to perform Mr Johnson. But the Rama Society has given me the will to live. Didn't get very far, did I? I've tried to tell her too. There are thousands like her. That's why psychiatrists are doing such good business. She goes to a Consulting Psychologist, a "Dr Largo". Dr Largo, huh? Well, there's not much more I can do around here. She's happy... and it hasn't cost her anything... yet. Give me a ring if anything comes up, will you? Thank you. Goodbye. I know you've been worrying when we begin separating Mrs Royce from her bankroll. We start today. How much do we go after? All of it. I happen to know she's very grateful to our Society. So, we'll allow her to mention us in her will. Now start playing that angle. Just hint at a will, without mentioning it by name. Play it so she believes she thought of it herself. And the Society will bring comfort and consolation to humanity for years to come. All because of her and her contribution. And most of all her son will be very happy if she does it. Now you've got it. We've been putting out for weeks Tony, but nothing is coming in. We need cash right now. What to you want me to do, Liane? Paint you a picture? I just told you how we're going to get it. But when? ... The old dame's liable to live forever. After she signs a will in our favor? Uhuh. But the minute we start to collect, the cops will be on our necks. That's been covered too. The Rama Society is a registered co-operation. Our names will never appear. All we have to is be patient, sit back and collect. Doctor, what about Mr Johnson in room 102? He's okay for discharge. Steve. Hi honey. What are you doing out of bed? The Doctor says I'm okay. I've got to get back to work. But you've been in an accident, a bad accident. I know, I know dear. I was lucky. Just when I was close to an answer to this case, something happens to my brakes. I just had them checked last week. Steve, please be careful. You would decide to fall in love with a cop. Hi Mac, I got news for you. New York just reported on Reed. For two years he worked with Tony Weldon, alias Thomas Whilton, alias Wells Anthony. Tony Weldon. he worked with Weldon in Denver and got three years. He got away. Why yeah. She worked with Weldon in Denver and got 3 years. He got away! He's still missing. Let's go. I've got to talk to .. Steve. All right, go have your talk, but I'm going with you. Yes dear. And when you're through, I'm going to see you go straight home to bed .. Yes dear. I mean it. I tell you it's a set up. This guy Weldon has got a record that goes back 15 years in 20 states. And yet nobody has ever been able to catch him. Why? Because he's always been smart enough to have someone front for him and take the rap. This way we smoke him out and we get Mrs Royce off the hook at the same time. I tell you it will work Captain. I don't know. Who'd you get to do it? A police woman. She could be recognized. Yeah, you're right. Hey, wait a minute. I got an idea. Ready to leave? Do you want to be an actress? Do you want the chance of a lifetime? Wait a minute. Are you a cop or an agent? Both. Steve, I think I'd better get you home. On the level darling. The department wants your help. And a detective by the name of Steve Johnson needs it badly. How can an actress help the Police Department? Don't ask questions now. All I want to know is will you do it? If it will help, I'll do anything you say, Steve. Ah, that's my girl. No-one will take that for a police car. Should be a good stake-out. Pretty nice setting for your act, huh? Hello Steve. Hi. So this is the young lady. Grace, this is Mr Dante. Miss Bradshaw. You know Mac? Sure, I know Mac... this way please. Now, when you're ready, this will be your Sance Room. Your instruction starts below. How did you get here? A trade secret. He's known professionally as "Dante The Great". A magician? Retired now. Now I only perform for friends, and to help out the law. Try to save people from criminals who use tricks of my trade to fleece the public. I consider it part of my work to expose any impostor who .. We're wasting time. We've got a lot to do. You have a record of all that is set upstairs? The microphones are concealed in the foyer and the Sance Room. Please sit Miss Bradshaw. You've got a big job ahead of you. You've got to learn all the Medium's tricks in a very short time. I had a crystal around here someplace. You can't afford a single mistake. So you must concentrate on what you see and hear. I said "concentrate". Well, I didn't know Phil Royce very well. Well, just tell me anything you remember about him. Sure. You ought to get a hold of Danny Bowman. He was from Tulsa. Danny Bowman? Yeah. He and Royce were pals. They hit the beach at Normandy together. How's it going? Great. She's wonderful. Working very hard. Good. At the moment of death the soul leaves .. Deeper in the throat! A spirit is supposed to be talking through you. The... soul... leaves... the... body. It... lives... for... a... time... in... the... invisible... world. The spirit at... this... time... is able to... communicate... with .. Oh, I can't remember the words. Keep talking. Keep talking! I can't. It's no use. Take it easy, honey. I'm sorry. Hello. Steve, Captain Edwards. Thank you. Yes sir. Oh that's great! Right away. Yes sir. Honey, I've got to leave. Stick with it will you. Where you going? They found Danny Bowman in Kansas City. Sorry to interrupt our talk Mr Johnson. I'm free now. Well you know the story Bowman. Mrs Royce is in trouble so, naturally we need all the help we can get. Well, I'll tell you all I know. Good. Phil Royce and I started out as rookies together. You seem so sad lately, dear. "Because of the suffering I feel all about me, mother." "Earthly goods mean nothing in my world." "But the lack of it causes so much pain in yours." "Happiness should be shared." You always felt that way, dear. "But more than ever now..." "I feel the suffering of others." But I have no earthly goods. I can do nothing. "Nothing... nothing..." Phillip seems so unhappy today. He wants to bring others here to share the peace and happiness he and I have found. I am troubled also when I think of the multitudes of such people. I can help now... but when I am gone? Who is going to carry on the work we have started here? Phillip keeps mentioning earthly goods. I have so much. It would have been Philip's. I could use it to bring others here. She's getting the idea now. Princess... I think I know a way. I want to speak to Phillip now. My powers are too weak to reach him now. The spirits visit us only when they wish. It's your money, Jessica. Exactly. But you can't leave it to an unknown organization headed by a "Medium". If you won't draw up the will, John, I'll get a lawyer who can. Very well. Good night. He's right Mrs Royce, you don't know them and .. I've got a good reason for doing it. It will make Phillip happy. Will you need me any more tonight? Bunco Squad. Sergeant Irvine speaking. Detective Johnson please. Please tell him that Barbara Madison called. Thank you. Well, Barbara. I'm so sorry I'm late Tony. I understand. Sit down. I've ordered for us. You seem upset. Anything wrong? You know, sometimes it helps to talk to someone. There's nothing you can do Tony. Well I can try. It's about Mrs Royce. The Police warned her that those people running the Rama Society are criminals. And they were right. Uh... what's all this about? Criminals and the Rama Society? Oh you know. It's in connection with that Medium she's been seeing. Don't you remember? Oh yes, of course. And you said they wouldn't accept the donation. Donation? They want everything she has! They've tricked her into making a will leaving her entire estate to their society. Has she signed the will? She's just having it drawn up. But I'm doing everything I can to stop it. Is there anything I can do to help? No, I've already called Detective Johnson. He wasn't in. As a matter of fact I think I'll call him again. Oh Barbara... is your car outside? Yes, why? Well, I know how you feel about Mrs Royce and .. I think we ought to go to Police Headquarters and not wait for the call. I hate to bother you, Tony.  No bother. Will be a pleasure. I just found a message on my desk that she tried to reach me last night. Maybe she was trying to tell us something? Get me Traffic. Traffic, Steve Johnson. That car that Barbara Madison was killed in last night. Have those brakes checked right away and let me know will you. Right. Good idea. Now what did you find out from Bowman? A most important letter that Phillip wrote to his mother before he was killed. Here's a copy of it. Bowman found it when he was collecting Royce's things to send home. He figured it would only bring more grief so he didn't mail it. This will give Dante and Grace a real angle. Get it to them right away. We're fighting against time. And don't forget to see Mrs Royce's phony psychologist. I'll take it right over, and I'll see Dr Largo. Oh please come in Mr... uh? The name is Johnson. Detective Johnson. Oh... what brings you here? Well, I don't have a warrant in my pocket if that is what's bothering you. Just a few questions. About what? You and Princess Liane. I've never met her. Okay... we'll play it your way. Now look. I didn't come over here to cause you any trouble. However, we have enough in our files on you .. What do you want to know? Why did you send Mrs Royce to the Rama Society? I had to. What do you want me to do? Not very much... we just want you to send her to a new medium. That's all. She took your advice once. See that she takes it again. I'll try. But Doctor Largo .. Princess Liane has helped me so much. Why should I leave her? My only wish is to add to your present happiness. To prepare you for the time when Phillip ascends to a higher plane. And it becomes more difficult for him to reach you. You mean .. I couldn't see him? Not talk to him any more? You can if you are prepared. New doors will be opened to you. You will become the object of special protection and guidance. And that is why I urge you to visit .. "Madame Bradshaw". 1209 Sunnydale. Dr Largo recommended you very highly. Doctor Largo is very gracious. I hope you won't be disappointed. You should be very happy. I see an aura about you. An aura of love. It is someone who's love is trying to reach you now. I see writing... a letter. A soldier. Phillip was a soldier. A letter reaching across the years. To... to who? "To my mother." Phillip? "Mother. You never received the last letter I wrote you before I left your world." "You must get it." But where? "My friend Danny Bowman. He took it." I hear voices. I hear a roaring sound that shakes the ground. I see a man... working. In a uniform... an airport. The name of the city is not clear. I get the initials... K... C . Kansas City. I hope I've been helpful. You have. Thank you. Honey, you were swell. Everything worked like magic. Like a charm. Does Bowman know what to do when Mrs Bowman gets there? He knows what to do. Now all we have to do is keep her coming here. She's so nice Steve, it's a shame to trick her this way. But we're only trying to protect her. Once she believes in you, we'll show her how she was taken in. Don't you see? The brakes on Barbara Madison's car and mine were cut the same way. We're up against killers. Why not grab them now and get it over with? Not yet... we want to get the head man. Relax. It's just a social call. I've been trying to get you on the phone. Why don't you tell me where you live? What's on your mind? Bad news. About what? Mrs Royce called to cancel another date. Something is wrong.  Did you talk with her? No. May just left a message. Get her on the phone. Oh no, Princess Liane... you've been most helpful. But the most amazing thing has happened. I have a letter. A real letter from Phillip. How wonderful for you... tell me about it. "Madame Bradshaw"... Oh yes, I'd very much like to meet her. Where does she live? ... 1209 Sunnydale. Madame Bradshaw? Yes, but I receive visitors by appointment only. It's very important that I talk with you. Very well. Drake! Please be seated. What is your problem? Are you sure that no-one else will hear what I say? We are alone in the house. Well, we can talk business. I don't understand. I'm telling you. Lay off of Mrs Royce. But Mrs Royce is a client... A client of the Rama Society. You'll send her back to us fast if you know what's good for you. What happened to you? Bradshaw's muscle-men worked me over. She says she's hanging on to Mrs Royce. Oh you .. Who is that? It's that Bunco cop, Johnson. Drake, you keep him here as long as you can. You have a little accident? A personal matter. Is there something I can do for you? Yeah... I'd like to have a talk with you. What do you want to talk about? Why Sergeant, how nice to see you. Where's your friend Reed? Well I haven't .. Would you like a cup of tea? "I have so much. It would have been Phillip's." "I could use it to bring others here, as he wishes." Look at this. It's a Police set up. [ telephone rings ] Hello? Oh Steve. Everything alright? Yeah, where are you? The Rama Society. Oh I get it. You followed Drake. Did you find anything? -I'll tell you later. Leave it right now. Don't worry honey, Steve will be here soon. You're early Mrs Royce. I know, I have so much to talk about today. I hope you don't mind. Of course not. I must discuss something very important with Phillip. It's about my will. Your will? Yes. You see Mr Bowman gave me Phillip's letter. And it was full of plans for the future he never saw. I want to make those plans come true. But I've already made my will leaving my estate to the Rama Society. Spirits of the outer world .. We seek... your... guidance. Appear... and... speak. Appear spirits... give us your counsel. The spirits hesitate to appear. They sense danger. Danger to you because of your will. But I made it to please Phillip. And it's going to stay that way. She's never change that will. Give me your gun. The... voices say... that you must change your will. Do you think Phillip will understand? He understands. It is his wish that you change .. Oh! Mr Wells! Stand up and turn around. What about the two downstairs? They didn't see us come in. They don't know who we are? They saw Drake. He has the best alibi in the world. He was miles away being watched by a cop. Wells and Reed did it. They got Mrs Royce. Johnson. Bunco Squad. Yes sir. Looks like a case for the Coroner. You take over from here, will you. Right. Hey Bill, call the Coroner. And you'd better get a tow-truck down here too. "All suspects of the Rama Society have been taken into custody." "Sergeant Johnson, return to headquarters." I now pronounce you... man and wife. Cut... okay... print it. Very good. Thank you. How was I? Like me? You were terrific. Wonderful, as a matter of fact, you were so convincing .. Do you think you can borrow the dress for a few days? Why Mr Johnson! Mr Johnson? You mean "Lieutenant" Johnson. He's my press agent. How wonderful! Cut! .... Okay? [ laughter ] Subs for KG by "Targa".
