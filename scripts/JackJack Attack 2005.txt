It's like Carrie, only with a K instead of a C, and an A instead of an E, and only one R, and an I instead of an IE. Tell me about the incident. Well, it started out like any normal sitting gig, you know, with the reassuring, and the parent, and all. Mrs. Parr, I can totally handle anything this baby can dish out. Can't I, little boo-boo-baby? Who can handle it? Who can handle it? Mrs. Parr? Mrs. Parr? Oh, well. She knows you're in good hands. Now who's ready for some neurological stimulation? It's time for cognitive developm... eh? Who's the goo-goo-baby? Where's he hiding? That was really weird. Wait right here. Hello Mrs. Parr, this is Kari. I have a question. About Jack-Jack? Can you call me? Jack-Jack? Baby? Where are you? Where... Ah! Mrs. Parr, it's me. Jack-Jack is fine, but weird things are happening and you need to tell me what to do, 'cause I'm... How'd you get... Wah! We're gonna calm things down a bit now, and look at flash cards. Won't that be fun? Triangle. Good. House. Good. Campfire. Don't panic! Baby on fire, baby on fire! Good baby! Nice baby... - Yes? - Is this the Parr's residence? Yes! I'm Kari, the babysitter! Well, hello, uh... Kari. I am... You're my replacement, thank heaven you've come! What does the S stand for? For... s... Sitter! Yeah, sitter. Originally I was gonna have initials for babysitter, but then I would've been going around wearing a big BS, and you understand why I couldn't go with that. - And you believed him. - The baby was exploding! You ever seen an exploding baby before, Mr. Dicker? - What's that? - You told anyone else about this? - Your parents? - Yeah, they tought I was being funny. But you believe me. Don't you Mr. Dicker? Sure, kid. I just wish I could forget the whole thing. You will, kid... You will.
