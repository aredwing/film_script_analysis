We will be waiting outside until you finish. Linda Doll, huh? drove all night while Hazkel slept like a log. / I After a while I began to feel sleepy. / i Although I was happy. / i Would Sue again. / i The long journey was about to end. / i and there would be more obstacles to arrive. / i I started thinking the future. / i could not be brighter ... / i ... although it had been embroidered with neon lights. / i was nice to think of Sue, walking to the top. / i is amazing how triggers imagination a full stomach. / i Lord Hazkel. Lord Hazkel. Hazkel Lord, wake up, it's raining. Do not you think we should raise the hood? Hazkel Lord, I will raise the roof. So far had things my way ... / i ... but from now on I expected something else ... / i ... and destiny would be different I had chosen to ... / i ... because when I opened the door ... / i Hazkel Lord, What happens? Are you hurt? Are you hurt, Mr. Hazkel? Begin with your sermon, I listen, but ... / i ... I know I culparis before opening the mouth. / i will say that you do not believe my story Hazkel about died. / i the expression of your face say "do not make me laugh." / i I saw him when he was already dead ... / i knew ... and blame me. / i Who would believe that fell off the car? / i For if he were here would say that I hit him ... / i in the head to steal the money. / i blame me, like it or not. / i instinctively fled, but I realized that would not work. / i Many people might identify. / i The man at the gas station and the waitress. / i It would be hard pressed to explain the blow on his head. / i The other possibility was to stay ... / i ... and tell the truth when police arrived. / i But that would be insane. / i laugh at my truth and have the rope around his neck. / i What else could I do to hide the body and get rid of the car? / i could not stop the car with him in it. / i would be like placing a headstone. / i My idea was to cover his with shrubs, not steal. / i But then I remembered that if driving, even if only 200 km .. / i need money ... at least for gasoline. / i addition, it would be stupid to let all that money to a dead man. / i Not only that. / i It should also take your driving license ... / i ... in case anyone I stopped on the road. / i I did not like thinking about it But police say ... / i ... that he had, but did not. / i clothes. The owner of a car so expensive would never wear these clothes. / i Some poly might suspect. / i Hey, this car is yours? Do not have otherwise to park ... ... To leave the wheels in the middle of the road? Here's how it happens accidents. Excuse me, officer. I was just raising the roof. 'I do not think. 'Next time, think. Multar not this time but be careful in the future. I know it's a lonely road, but cars pass every now and ... ... We have many accidents. Thank you, officer. did not leave anything in the car I identify as Roberts. / i If they found the dead, would be me. / i drove in the rain. / i beat drops the windshield like tears. / i I kept imagining it was pursued. / i I could hear sirens in the distance. / i much led me to the 100 km ... / i to the border ... with California ... / i ... do not know. / i I lost track of time. / i But the rain had stopped and the sun was out ... / i ... when I to the inspection booth. / i -Hey, take fruit or vegetables? -No. - Any type of livestock or poultry? -No. Allow me to your document and driver's license. - What's in the trunk? -Solo bags. Hazkel Charles Jr., 30, brown eyes, dark hair ... ... No identifying marks. - Are you Charles Hazkel Jr.? -Yes. Remember that if you stay more than 30 days must ... Tuition and replace ... using California. Well, but I'll be in the state for long. Well, you can leave. could not drive more without sleep. Police or not ... / i Knew I needed to ... board ear, and for a while. was dead tired. / i No. No, sir Hazkel, no. Hazkel Lord, You can not die. They think ... I ... I did. No, sir Hazkel, no. Who is it? The cleaning woman. I can come clean? Later. -Within half an hour. 'Well, sir. There was no time to lose. / i Every minute that I was Charles Hazkel was dangerous. / I would have to be up come to a city ... / i ... where could leave car and go. / i Which meant continue driving to ... / i ... San Bernardino, or perhaps to Los Angeles. / i In a small town my presence could be noticed ... / i ... but in the city would be safer. / i After leaving the car could go to Sue. / i But those five minutes on the state border ... / i ... made me realize, that might be a good idea ... / i ... know more of Mr. Hazkel. / i If someone did any questions .... / i ... could give responses. / i The first thing I learned is that I had $ 768. / i was a lot of money. But, believe me ... / i ... was the kind of money I did not like to have. / i later learned from a letter carried in his briefcase ... / i ... it was not as generous or open as to pay ... / i dinner ... a stranger hitchhiking. / i Before I finished reading I saw that rather it was an opportunist. / i was a letter to his father California ... / i ... who had not seen in many years. / i it became Hazkel go through a sales ... / i ... of hymns. / i was easy to see how expected Hazkel recover ... / i ... lost money on Miami: / i deceiving his father. / i That was all I could find it ... / i ... and it was enough. / i I told myself maybe the old Hazkel ... / i was lucky ... that his son died. / i never know, but saved him from receiving propaganda of sacred literature. / i Near the airport Desert Center stopped by water. / I was a woman. / i Hey, you! Come if you want the ride. - Where does it go? - Where are you going? It took me by surprise and turned my head to face her. / i She stared forward, and could not see his eyes. / i But I was young, no more than 24 years. / i seemed like it was thrown the worst freight train. / i Despite this, seemed to be beautiful. / i It was not the beauty of a movie star ... / i ... or the beauty you dream when you're with your wife ... / i But natural beauty. / i A beauty that almost frightens for being so real. / i Then she turned suddenly. / i - Where did you say was I? -A Los Angeles. Are the Angels? That will well for me, sir. 'It's what I feared. - What did she say? Nothing. I thought aloud. People get into trouble for doing that. - What is your name? Vera-You can call me if you like. - Do you live in LA? -No. - Where are you from? -From beyond. - Needles? -No. Oh, I know, Phoenix. You look like a girl Phoenix. Are they so bad girls in Phoenix? must be very tired, because she fell asleep ... / i twenty minutes .. having climbed into the car. / i lay scattered and his head against the door ... / i ... like Hazkel. I did not like, but ... / i ... not bother. / i she was not to worry. / i had overcome the feeling I wonder when I looked. / i wrote it off to my nerves. / i I guess I was something sensitive. / i Pretty sensitized. / i Rather than get upset , I began to feel pity. / i Poor girl, perhaps had gone wrong. / i Who was / i Why went to Los Angeles / i first Where would / i All I knew of it was his name. / i While that did no difference. / i A few hours and would be in Hollywood. / i would forget everything, would park the car and look to Sue. / i end the nightmare to be a dead man. / i What happened with this woman was not my business. / i Where did you leave your body? Where did you leave the owner of this car? You do not fool anyone. This car belongs to one such Hazkel. And that's not you. You're crazy, that's my name, Charles Hazkel. I can prove it. -My driving license. -Save yourself the explanation, Mr. Having the wallet Hazkel only makes it worse. I traveled with Charles Hazkel all the way from Louisiana. He picked me up at the outside of Shreveport. 'You're ... 'I have heard. Then I remembered everything. / i All about grief, scars and scratches. / i There was no doubt. / i Vera should be the woman who Hazkel had mentioned. / I She must have happened when I slept. / i Well? ... ... I'm waiting. was ready, she had me. / i Hazkel Such was not dead yet. / i not lay hard and cold in a ravine in Arizona. / i was sitting to my right there in the car ... / i laughing like crazy ... while chasing me. / i Well? There was nothing I could say. / i was his play. / i Vera or any that was his name ... / i ... it was just my luck collect along the way. / i It could have been Hellen, Mary, Evelyn and Ruth. / I had to be the last person I should have found. / i Such is life. / i Whichever way you go the destination place a stick ... / i ... for one trip. / i I told him everything, but she did not believe my story. / i I should have saved saliva. / i It's the biggest lie I've heard in my life. So you fell off the car? Who do you think you talking about? Listen, I have the world and recognize a liar when I see it. How was it? Would you torciste neck? Wait, what I told you is true. Do you see why I act like that? you think I killed him. The same would have thought the police. Well, maybe they still think so. Who makes sure I will not talk? Vera, I am innocent. Believe me it is so. I will not win anything by sending to court. The police are not my friends. If there is a reward ... But there is not. Thank you. Do not thank me yet, no you end up so easy. Consider these notes. Do all you had? - Is not that enough? -No. I thought I had more. No more. You can register if you think something hidden. Right. Perhaps so. He told me he was going to $ 3000 bet ... A horse ... "Paradise" Santa Anita. 'I was cheating, was 300. -Could be. Insurance. Three bills. 300. He was a compulsive gambler. Do not try to teach me anything Charlie Hazkel. Remember that I met better than you. Ok, you know I was a betting man, Does that explain a bet of 3 000? I'm not so sure that did not have those 3 thousand. Why should I believe? Your face a cheap crook. -Wait a minute. -Shut up. You're a cheap crook And you killed. For two cents I changed opinion. Delatar you. -Okay, do not fret. 'I do not do ... Just remember you ... who is the boss here. If you shut up and I do not argue ... Not have to worry ... but if you act wisely ... Get you into prison .. as open your mouth. -I do not dispute. -You better not do it. Although look like a scammer ... ... I hate to see a young guy smelling like you ... Arizona ... the perfume gives the murderers. I'm not a murderer. Of course not ... Hazkel ... were killed himself. He fell, that's all. I've already explained. Sure ... and then you You gave your belongings. I already told you why. -Leave it. There is no difference, I'm not a crybaby. I liked Hazkel less than I like you. -Yeah, I saw what you did. - What do you mean? -The scratches on his wrist. 'Of course I scratched him. It's what I said. Your idea was to drive the car a little more ... San Bernardino ... maybe even and leave. You were going to sell? Sell ??it ? You think I'm crazy? Sell ??a car outside. All I want leave it somewhere. Not only have no scruples, have no brain. I do not understand. It may be good I've found. Surely you would have caught. Tonto. Do not know an abandoned car ... Always starts ... an investigation? If the cops find him become curious. They wonder where is the owner. And unless they find Hazkel, I find you. Never would have thought. It is said that the only thing can do is sell it. Register under another name. For the next store. I want to buy a bottle ... ... Before coming to Los Angeles. Ok, I hope and I pick you up later. Not at all. You come too. From now on we as Siamese twins. We will do so, but do not understand. It happens that I do not want to miss. Do not betray if what you fear. I would not say that. I'll see you sell this car, so you do not stop. Thank you. Although I think your interest is financial. You want a percentage of profits. Well, since you insist, I can not refuse. -The 100% will be fine. 'I you quiet. For a minute I thought everything you'd want. I do not want to take advantage. Within hours we were in Hollywood. / i I recognize the places Sue described to me. / i I was surprised by the fact be ending the trip ... / i ... and feel that Sue was further than the beginning. / i Vera not joking when he said "Like Siamese twins." / I He rented a small department ... / i ... as Mrs. Charles Hazkel. / i When I objected, said it was to sell the car. / i The seller would think there was something strange if I called ... / i ... and found out we had different names. / i -Home, sweet home. -Yes. Not bad at all. 'In case there is any doubt, I I will take the bedroom. -Yes. It is very hot in here. -Leave the blinds down. -Well. The old man said he had a bed recessed behind this door. Do you know how this works? I invented it. - Any questions? 'You can not have everything. I will use the bathroom first. I do not know why, but I knew you would. Good! You feel better to be clean. Although I have five kilos less. Could be. I think you manage to do so keep your body young. I wish such stop playing the saxophone. It makes me nervous. Forget it. Drink something. Are you not afraid to drink a lot? If you do not want bebieras do not offer it. Why are you so irritable? you did you get into this. You should be grateful that it has betrayed you. If I had not been comprehensive 'd be in jail. So cheer up. Shake off that evil genius Or your conscience bother you? -No, not so. -Great, that's good. He's dead and nothing can back to life. I will never understand this concern for something that was done. For the last time I say that I did not kill him. Hazkel was sick. Perhaps there before falling dead, do not know. Sure, sure. He died old. According ... ... If it makes you feel better ... ... You did not kill him. Thank you. -We have no liquor, Roberts. -Yes. Too bad, tonight I wanted to be happy. -Well, I think you did. - Am I happy? Like a dog with two tails. That is good. Just wanted to be. Why? Why wanted to be happy? I do not know, for some things. You should have my concerns. If I had your problems remain sober. I have the key that door! You're right. -I have always right. Do you know? I do not like your attitude, Roberts. Well, there are many things I do not like. Insurance. Life is like a ball game ... ... One should use what arrive before awakening ... ... In the second half. I bet you read it. That's the problem with you. All you do is complain. I take it easy. And the best way. Maybe that's what makes every evil work. Let us leave that, Professor. People try to dodge fate. Think of yourself, for example. You're lucky to be alive. Suppose Hazkel would open your door. Now yaceras in the field. Think about it. I am very tired. There are many people dying at this moment ... And would give anything ... to change place with you. I know what I'm talking about. I'm not so sure. At least they know what to expect ... and not have to sweat blood wondering what will happen. Your philosophy stinks, man. We all know we will die some day ... the only problem is when. Why are we talking about this? Next time talk about politics. Where are the cigarettes? On the table, asshole. We are bored mutually talking for a couple hours. / i Every five minutes I suspected you want another bottle ... / i ... or radio, or something to read. / i Finally, we ended the conversation. / i I know there are only eleven, but I get up early ... ... To view used cars. Do not worry about that ... Have all the time ... the world. Maybe you have it, but if you think ... I'll stay ... here more than you need, you're crazy. Not a bad place. They pay a lot for a place like this in New York. I would not even outside the Ritz. Terrible liquor. Have an unusual cough, you should do something about it. I will. That's what Camille said. - Who? -No one you know. - Not the lady who died of tuberculosis? -Yes. It would be a relief for if you die fast. Free with car stolen from the old Hazkel. I do not want to die anyone else. Not even me? Especially you. One person was me. If you happen to you ... would be what I need. Do not taste, Is not it, Roberts? Yup ? I love you. My favorite sport is I have a prisoner. After selling the car can go to hell. But not until then. I'm going to bed. Good night. Do not try to steal away at night. All doors are closed. Anyway ... In the morning ... if I see that you're gone I will notify the police. 'They get you. Do not worry, I can take care. Good night. I hope that the folding bed not too uncomfortable for you. That will not remove the dream, right? Crest View ... Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? No. Not yet, honey. Tomorrow ... ... Maybe. If this were fiction, I fall in love with Vera. / i I marry her, would a respectable woman. / i Or she would some great sacrifice for me ... / i ... and then die. / i Sue and I lloraramos some on his grave ... / i ... and we would have thought ... / i ... about what is good in each of us. / i Vera But, unfortunately, was so sour in the morning ... / i ... as he had been the night before. / i Very good, very good, I'm coming. Vera, it's almost noon. So what? The seller be there all day. It may be all year, but I will not wait that long. Shut up. You sound like a husband. - Do I deserve a whistle? -Sure, but come on. Come, come. Spending $ 85 and two hours fixing my ... ... And all you can say is "we." Come on. We spent some batches of cars here last night. How we think get for this? I do not know. Pretty. Let me do everything. Can be two thousand dollars? I do not know. But do not worry. Try to get as much as possible. If I leave without bargaining might think that we stole. And do not call me Roberts, Do you understand? Or we delataremos. I need your advice. You better stay seated and with the mouth closed. Remember that we are in the same boat, if something happens ... -Forget it and drive. -You are my wife, Vera Hazkel. Look, after sell the car ... Return to that place ... Hollywood on the boulevard ... ... I saw a leather jacket and I bought it too. After the business we will say goodbye. True, I forgot. I think I'm getting used to you. It's a habit that you begin to change. Let's try it here. Good afternoon, what I can do for you? We want to sell the car. -If the price is right. If you are good mechanics, would be about $ 1600. Tony, look at this engine. Sixteen hundred, Are you kidding? Maybe 1850. Before taking it for 1850 I destroy it and collect the insurance. Miss, this engine has gone far. While the mechanical checked the car ... / i ... we were discussing. / i Finally, when we were tired ... / i ... we reached a settlement ... / i price ... / i 'All right, done deal. 'Well, come in and will sign. I have the title property here. Vera, meanwhile look in the trunk ... Has been ... maybe something in it. 'Well, darling. $ 1850, Damn crook! -New York, huh? -Yes. 'But you bought the car in Miami. -Yes. Consider the insurance, we can transfer or cancel. What type of insurance have you, Mr. Hazkel? Well ... Are not all papers there? I see none. Surely you know what kind is the car insurance. The name of the company? Yes, but ... If you give me the name of the company ... I'll be happy ... all the details. -Well ... - Have you signed and the papers? -No, not yet. Bueno. Then do not. Do not sell. 'Wait a minute, Ms. Hazkel. 'Come on, darling. What is the problem? Did you change your mind? Yes, sorry, I think so. 'But, Vera ... 'Come on. Took me out of trouble, but still do not understand all this. You'll understand in a moment. I almost get rid of a gold mine. $ 1800 is no small thing. I had all the papers as I thought. -We will not sell the car. - You get what you want? Wait a minute. You said we would not be safe ...

'I accuse you of murder. 'You're ready, do not get caught. I have seven. If I get caught, you realize that you stay outside? How to stay out? Run out of the $ 1850 would get for the car. You'd be stupid leaving that money by a long shot. Let me sell it tomorrow. With that money ... ... An intelligent woman like you shall leave soon. And the two would be free -I will be free anyway. And the two would be free -I will be free anyway. Perhaps. Perhaps. But if they catch me ... Will get you ... you too. - You mean you speak? -No, I meant. -No matter what you meant. Although the poly count I was with you ... ... What I can do to me? I can give the same medicine that I give to you. A rope. Anyway, I'm on my way and, All they can do is accelerated. Right.

So suppose that call the cops ... If you're innocent ..., What do you fear? Well, call them, Vera. Go ahead, call them. At least they will give me a fair deal. - You want me to call? -You heard me. But I warn you. If you ask me I will say that we were together, that you helped me. 'If I get arrested, go together. -Do not you dare, you coward! No? Try and see. Call them, go. Okay, I will. Does anyone know information? I want the number of Hollywood police. Well, I have, thank you. Wait a minute, Vera, would not. Do not do it? Let me show you from what I can. Calm down. Let's talk about this. That was early afternoon. / i The conversation was agitated, but at least calmed down. / i But while minutes passed ... / i ... and more obstacles to their plan exploded in my head ... / i ... the air was becoming thick. / i Every word out of our lips ... / i ... snapped like a whip. / i I reminded him that if he Hazkel did not even know ... / i ... the name of my mother or what school had gone ... / i ... the name of my best friend, whether he had an aunt Emma ... / i my religion ... or ever had a dog. / i not even know what it was middle initial of my name. / i also commented that Hazkel true ... / i had a scar ... in the forearm. / i His people never saw that scar.

No? For that amount of money I would cortases leg. You're drunk and crazy, Vera. Dennciame if you want, but leave me out in this. How do we know that Hazkel was not a fraud? Maybe not the child. You dreamed Perhaps. Well, there you will be the I'm dreaming ... ... When the weight of the law fall on your shoulders. There is a nice gas chamber waiting for you, Roberts. And do not dream that extradition can save you! Where's the phone? -Vera. -Leave me alone. Choose a phone to call the police. I hate you, smelly bastard. Leave me alone! I'll leave when I promise leave the phone alone. -You're hurting me, - Do you promise? Agreed. You hurt me. I'm sorry, but ... It's hot here, open the window! -Not hot. -Or do you or I do. You're not a gentleman, you see? -Yes. Well, I'll open the window. Vera! Open the door, please. Open it, open it. Do not use the phone, listen to me. I do not like, Roberts. You're a gentleman. You hurt me. And now I will do the same for you. If you open the door the'll throw down, Vera. Vera, do not call the police, listen to me. Do anything you want. Let me enter. Tear off the phone! The world is full of skeptics ... / i ...
