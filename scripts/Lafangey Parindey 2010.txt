When your opponent realizes that you are pissing through your nose then... Option one... even he is struck by fear. Or option two...he's rejoicing. ln any case, he has lost focus. Like a mad rabid dog he begins to go berserk. Then...then he comes and stands exactly where you want him. The right punch at the right time. Some call it luck. l...call it smartness. My brave tiger! These birds, these wandering souls, they are wild birds They take life head-on, these wild birds Taking their flights of fancy They go past each hurdle Playing hide and seek with death A game with danger is their whim They play fair; they play dirty, these wild birds Fire seethes in their hearts One dream seized makes way for another Boys, the class is over. Nothing can stop them now No hurdle, no worries High on life These studs will romp freely Taking their flights of fancy They go past each hurdle Playing hide and seek with death A game with danger is their whim They play fair; they play dirty, these wild birds Rameshwara! Can't you hear? What's wrong with your cheek? All the time you have a broken nose, head, ears... Granny, my ear, Granny. Why have you tied this kerchief around your head? Have you taken up a job of lifting bricks? Will you please go home? What go home? C'mon, now drop us. Drop you? Why? Are you ashamed of having an old woman sit on your bike? Granny, you sit behind me. Oh! - Come on. Sapna, wear what you were wearing yesterday. You look hot in it. l'll meet you at the same place. Hey, easy, easy. l'll call you later. Loser. You don't have a cell phone? Why will l give my cell number to every chick? Point. Point. - Yeah. Who among you is Faisal Latif Sheikh? What's the matter, sir? He's got the Padmashree award. We are here to give it to him. l am Faisal. You? What's with the slapping, sir? Hey, hero! You want to fight? Sir, he's the same fighter. Hey, fighter... You'll hit me? You son of a... Let go, Pawar. Why are you creating a scene? Look at him Anna (Big brother). Messing with a cop. Take it easy. He's Usman's man. What has Chaddi done? We got a tip-off that he steals car logos from Dadar Parsee Colony. Chaddi? No, Anna. lt must be Taikalwaadi's Faisal. Oh, Pawar. Where is Taikalwaadi? Where is Tilakwaadi? Go catch hold of that Faisal. Landge, all well? Yeah. Good. Been a while. - Yeah, let's catch up. Mr. Fighter. Better take it easy... Else Daddy will be angry. Good joke! See you again. - Yeah, see you. That's how relations are maintained. - Bye. Come on, Landge. Two slaps and you wet your pants? - No, Anna. What no? l can see you trembling. C'mon now. Let's get some tea. What are these guys playing? lt's called tribal football. Come here! - What happened? You guys carry on, we'll be back. You Madrasi, get lost from here. Diesel, look at this hero uncle. Dude, what's your name? Ajay. - Dude, couldn't you find a girl from... ...any other waadi (neighbourhood) to play wheelie? ldiot, it's called skating dance. And she's our very own Kareena Kapoor. Yes. l am Kareena Kapoor. Now get lost from here. Nandu, tell him. Hey, Dance Bar... What'll you do otherwise? l'll hit you so hard... ...you'll have to keep holding it the rest of your life. Pinky, chill. Guys give her a break. Hey, hey... Ganpati (lndian festival) is not anytime soon. What are you guys practicing for now? Nandu... You know lndia's Got Talent? They are practicing for that. What are you saying! Straight away at the country level. Wow! Dance Bar, can l also come along? Please... l'll shower notes when you dance. Bloody losers! You will do nothing but screw everybody's happiness. Hey, Dance Bar, wait! - lt's pointless talking to you. Wait! You freaks! Have you gone crazy? Why are you getting so upset? Get lost! Get lost! C'mon guys quick. Fahim, light it. l am. You little pest! How many times have l told you to stop this nonsense! Do l ever stop you from speeding your bike? Have you noticed your size, you midget? Let go off my collar. Let go! Fahim, tell him to keep his hands off me. He'll be a goner if l lose it. lf l see you smoking again l'll hang you upside down... ...and put your rear on fire. Acting smart with me, huh? - Yes. lf l don't mess up your bike in the next two days... ...l won't call myself Babloo Mane. Fahim, note it down. What are you laughing at? l am getting out of here. Acting smart, huh? Nandu, even l want to become a fighter like you. Will you take me along? My dear midget, one little smack is all it takes for you to wet your pants. And you want to fight, is it? Buzz off! l know you are scared of me. The day l become a good boxer, nobody will pay attention to you. You are right man. Hello? Yes, Bhai. Right now? Okay, l'll be there. 10 minutes. Baldy's call? Abhishek Bachchan's call. C'mon. Nandu, beware of Baldy. He'll make minced meat out of you and have it for dinner. Kudroos Miyaa! The meat's just right. - Oh good. Please serve it outside. ls Usman Bhai there? - Yeah. Upstairs. lsn't Nandu here yet? Come. No, no, not there, sit next to me. So, One Shot, l have heard you like driving fast. Anna has to go somewhere on business. You have to drive him there. l drive for pleasure, Bhai. Not for business. Listen to me, Usman... Look, Anna. He'll go with you today; tomorrow he'll learn something else. That's how he'll get to know the business. Nandu's still young. He has enough time to learn. Listen, Anna... - Keys? Car keys? Atta boy! Qasim! Get my parcel. Listen, hero, that's just to be kept. Not to be used. He can use it only when he keeps it, right? So, hero, what's the deal? What? The other day you were about to rap a cop... ...now Usman wants to pull you into his business. What's up with you? No big deal, Anna. l want to be like you. You've lost it! There's a huge difference between you and me. Do you get it, One Shot Nandu? ln your line of work, one shot means one loses the fight... ...and is out of the game. ln my line, one shot means death. End of game. Are you getting the difference? Anyway, forget it. Get out of this nasty circle. A friend of mine runs a bar in Malad. l've put in a word. Call him. He'll get you a job. What's the job? Scrubbing dishes! Are you up for it? Oh c'mon, Anna! You think l'll reduce you to a dish washer, is it? You and your wits, Anna. lt's simple. You just have to stand guard... ...and flex those muscles of yours. A bouncer's job. Simple. Have you lost it, Anna?! You want me to become a bouncer! Me? A bouncer? What's wrong with it? An honest job isn't your thing, is it? l fight honestly, don't l? l am trying to... Stop the car ahead. lf l don't return in 15 minutes go straight to Usman. l'll meet you there. Hey, Rambo, give that to me. Leave the engine on. Hey, Hritik Roshan! Hey, Raju! You are so handsome. Give me 5 bucks, wont you? Give it darling. You came in a car but you'll go back in a helicopter. l swear! l have a black tongue. What l say comes true. l have a direct connection with God. Now give me some money please. lt's raining. Please hurry. Here. Go. l'll have dinner in your name today. Look here, wont you? Let's go, let's go, Nandu! Trap them! Trap the bastards! Turn right. You are hit, Anna! l am taking you to a hospital. lt's nothing. We must reach Usman. This is not the time for heroism, Anna. Here, tie this around your... What the hell did you do?! l think...l hit someone. A million times l told you to stay out of this, but you didn't listen to me! What now? - What now?! Drive fast. l'll think of something. Nandu, stop the car. Why? Stop the car and run off. l am not leaving, Anna. Do as l say. Open the door. Anna! - Stop the car. Open the door Anna! You moron! You couldn't see someone right in front of your car! The windshield was shattered, Bhai. l couldn't make out. And Anna? Where did you leave him? Anna left with the car, Bhai. Anna saved half your life. And has left the remaining half to me. Bhai, Anna's dead. l am leaving, mom. l am late. Don't leave without your lunch box. Can l get some tea, mom? - Yes. Mom, because of her dancing, people call her Dance Bar. They call you a Loser. Did l ever say it bothers me? l am not talking to you. You wouldn't dare. l'll slap you so hard; all that arrogance will fly out of the window. Really? C'mon. l dare you. What's going on here? Look at her, mom. She starts her day with a fight. Enough said now. What do l care? Keep pampering her. You'll realize your mistake when she dances in a bar and shames all of us. At least l'll be working. Will you two shut up! Let me study. There goes Madam Barrister! This house is filled with weird characters. Go safely. Chaddi, please drop me. l am running late. Again! l seem to be running a nice taxi service here. Sai Baba (lndian saint), get me to work on time. Mom, uncle's here to collect the lunch boxes. Let's go. Kokhon Da, your 9:13 train is gone. Better not, dear. Will cost me a casual leave. They say, everyone's destiny is written beforehand. So is mine. But mine seems to be written in English. l hardly get it. No matter how hard l try l just can't make sense of it. Otherwise what's a terrific dancer like me doing here? Forget it, Pinky! Don't even try, it's in English! Pinky, again you are here. lf l find you here one more time during work hours l'll have to sack you. Now get back to work. Sorry, sir. Mad girl. He caught me again. - What did he say? l will sack you. Size 7 for an hour. You know what 'sack' means, right? He'll fire you. You think l want to spend my life here? But dear, whatever time you spend here, make it as peaceful as possible. Didi, l want that red one. Blue won't do? No. - Why? Let's go. Hey look at that. Little Miss Sunshine is on a romp. Not bad! Looks like your sweetheart is falling for her. Excuse me! He's not my sweetheart! We just practise together. Didn't you say the other day that he's absolutely mad about you? He is. l am not. Oh! Tell me, does he make a pass at you while dancing? Don't lie. A pass and him? No way. He's such a sissy! But l never miss a chance. Way to go! Auto! Tina, Hurry up! Yeah, coming. What is it? Passport... - Passport? lndia's Got Talent. Audition's happening soon. to get out of here. One day this passport will have my photo on it. lt will. lt surely will. But can we leave now? Otherwise your 50 lakhs will cost me my 10:50 train! You can't make it on time even on a holiday, Ajju? You'll go crazy if l tell you why. Look at this. - World Championship video! Sarah and Matthew! What are you saying! Show me. - Yeah, yeah, let it start. What a lovely turn... Look at their twists! Oh! Even we can do this. Really? Let's see. C'mon. You Madrasi, get lost from here. Dude, what's your name? - Ajay. Dude, couldn't you find a girl from... ...any other waadi (neighbourhood) to play wheelie? ldiot, it's called skating dance. And she's our very own Kareena Kapoor. Yes. l am Kareena Kapoor. Now get lost from here. Nandu, tell him. Hey, Dance Bar... What'll you do otherwise? l'll hit you so hard... ...you'll have to keep holding it the rest of your life. Wait. You freaks! Have you gone crazy? Why are you getting so upset? Get lost! Get lost. Miss Joan of Arc! They have left. Don't be so upset. Pinky, look at me. You are a superb dancer. l haven't seen a better skate dancer than you in the whole world... ...let alone in this waadi. l know that. l am not angry because l doubt my talent. l am angry because l am born amidst these people! They don't want to come up in life... But they will pull down others who try so. But nobody can stop me. No matter how hard they try. We won't practise here from tomorrow. Hello, Tina... Even a bicycle can't venture here, leave alone a cab. Oh shut up! Some walking will do you good anyway. This side is yours. And that's for the hens. Tina darling, how awesome are you! Pinky, what the hell is this! Can't we just practise at the school? - Please, Ajay. l don't have a choice, right? - Right. Okay, then. Will this do? lt's perfect. What's this fan doing here? lt's 'doing' those chicks! l'll give you one... Not here sweetie...later... when we are alone... Mom, l'll be late tomorrow. Skating? Will you skate for your husband after you get married? You won't get it now. You'll realize the day you see me on TV. Go give your brother some food. Poor thing must be tired watching TV the whole day! Mom! ls dinner ready? Ajay! Don't trip! - Sorry, sorry. l can't do it any more now. Just once more. - No. Just one more time. - Okay, c'mon. Yeah, Tina... lt's raining very hard. l'll call you later. What the hell did you do?! l think...l hit someone. Good morning, sir. - Good morning, Kadam. What's the scene? Anna shot Yadav at point blank in Raja lane. Yadav's men followed him. They fired two rounds at him. Anna was dashing ahead. He even hit a girl on the way. Finally, he banged the car here. Anna's body? lt's in Patkar hospital. Kadam, give me the torch. Anna took the wheel after coming here. Someone else was driving till he reached this spot. Match the footprints with Anna's. Test the blood samples and finger prints. Yes, sir. How's the girl? Huh? - The girl? She's in a coma. Noor, get me a cup of tea. Chaddi, what did that specialist say? Speak up man! There's nothing left to say. What do you mean? l mean there's no hope. She'll be blind for the rest of her miserable life. There must be some hope. National Geographic is full of such miracles. Right now, the doctor is saying there's no hope. And he is among the top doctors of Mumbai. Nandu, here's the balance after paying the doctor. Put it in the bank in her name. This will barely suffice for a fortnight's medicines. Anna destroyed her life. l admire Usman Bhai... He's a true friend... Ever since Anna's name has been involved in this accident... ...he has been pouring money to clear it. What's the point now? Anna did what he had to. What? What did you say? Anna had taken two bullets on his chest! Nandu, this girl is like Chaddi's sister. He's bound to be hurt. So? Didn't Anna mean anything to us? Nandu, l am not as smart as you are. But l know one thing...Pinky's life is screwed for no fault of hers. Someone has to be responsible for this. You say, don't blame Anna. But tell me, Nandu, who should l blame if not Anna? Who should l blame for making that innocent girl blind? She wanted to become a dancer, you know. She used to say, Dancing is my passport to get out of here. Who should l blame for shattering her dream? Tell me, Nandu. Nandu, Nandu! Sir! Sir! May your kids prosper... may you get success in life... Sir, please give me Will you have a wadapaav? No, sir. l fast on Thursdays. But today's a Friday. Actually, sir... l was unwell yesterday. So l am fasting today. l never miss it. That's why l am so close to God. How many of Yadav's men followed the car? Two, sir. Was Anna driving? No, sir. There was a boy in his early twenties. He was driving. He gave me 20 bucks. How did he look? Just like Hrithik Roshan. Fair. lt was dark. l couldn't see clearly. Besides it was raining. Sir, please give me... Thank you, sir. Sir, will you drop me at the next signal? Should l get in, sir? Hey! May your kids grow up and suck your blood! Qasim, isn't he taking more than usual today? l don't know, Bhai. He looks distracted. She'll be blind for the rest of her miserable life. This will barely suffice for a fortnight's medicines. What's wrong with you? Who should l blame for making that innocent girl blind?! She wanted to become a dancer, you know. She used to say, Dancing is my passport to get out of here. Who should l blame for shattering her dream? Someone has to be responsible for this. Tell me, Nandu. You gave me quite a scare today, my boy. Bhai, l want more than regular today. Kudroos Miyaa, bandage his head properly. Looks like his brain is damaged. But, Bhai... - Ha! Have l ever said no to you? No, right? C'mon. What is it? Take this. Put it in Pinky's bank account. But, Nandu... Listen, does her loser of a brother do anything? Of course he does. He acts smart. Ever since Pinky lost her job, he behaves as if he rules the house. And skating? She can't even walk on her own. How the hell will she skate! She was discharged from the hospital 15 days ago. Job's gone. She just sits in a corner thinking about something. From Cinderella to Thumbelina in just one unlucky stroke. Ganya, give me my bag. Mom, l am leaving. Where are you going? For practise, mom. Look at her, mom. She's not done with her dancing yet. l'll take Ganya along. Let's go, Ganya. Can't even stand properly and madam here wants to dance. You'll never understand. Oh! Take that black one man. Chaddi, you won't change! How much more carom will you play? C'mon, let's begin. What are you staring at? Give your hand. C'mon. Sorry, sorry! Let's try again. Pinky! Are you okay? - Yeah. Go home and put some balm. You'll feel better. ls she a better dancer than me? Who? Little Miss Sunshine. Your new dance partner. Shalaka Mogre. That... No, you are right. lf you dance with a blind girl you'll have to beg for money. TV show is out of question. lt's not what you think. l didn't have any other option. Otherwise a terrific dancer like you... Enough of your sweet talk. Let this TV show get done. Then we'll do something together. Sit at home and do it with yourself. Go now. Eyes with wings Two crazy eyes Eyes with wings They lay awake, days and nights Eyes with wings Two crazy eyes Eyes with wings They lay awake, days and nights They'll flap their wings and fly away ln the sky up there and lose their way Full of pride, these wandering eyes Eyes with wings Two crazy eyes Eyes with wings in the land of clouds and winds Pluck the shining stars of precious dreams Oh look at them, the moon they steal! lt's me, Rahim Chacha. And with their lids, they make it a veil They'll fly back home in the blink of an eye With their precious dreams and with their spirits high Mom! Full of grace, these famous eyes Eyes with wings Two crazy eyes C'mon guys. Crack it this time. No more mistakes. Take him to the left. Hold him. Hey you midget! Get down! Why are you guys obsessed with my collar! Get down, you pest. C'mon guys. Take him to the left. Chaddi! - Yeah? You guys aren't getting it right. We'll try it later. l have a job for you. What? - l... C'mon guys, bring it on! Give me another chilly. You are crazy. Here... So, what have you thought? About what? About what l said. What exactly is he going to do? That l don't know. But Nandu is not the kind to waste time. l am not interested. Meet him, at least. He's coming tomorrow morning. l don't want any favours from anyone. What's the harm in trying? Why does he need to do all this? Sweetheart, there are people who help others. He says, he'll teach me to see. l am sure he just wants to lay his hands on me. Teach me to see! Oh hello! Who do you think you are? Aishwarya Rai? You think he's dying to lay his hands on you? Exactly! By the way... ...the best chicks from Paul's classes have the hots for him, okay. Here we are. Where have you got me? lf you try to act fresh, l'll bite you so bad, you'll die. You know why l think you'll learn to see? Because you love to fight...with yourself... ...with people around...with life. Be careful. Bloody swine! Lesson No. 2. Listen and react at the same time. Don't listen first and react later. Get up, l'll explain lesson No.1 These 30 seconds under water. Don't ever forget these 30 seconds. lf you want to see as desperately as you wanted to breathe... ...nobody can stop you from seeing. Pinky, you don't need eyes to see. You need to be possessed. lf you are possessed enough... ...then you'll be a ten times better dancer than before. Got it? Sorry. l am sorry too Pinky. l was a bit too rough. Let's go. Chaddi, your grandma's here! What are these guys doing here? What did you think? l fight blind-folded without training? This is where l train. Guys, get ready. l'll explain things to her till then. Give your bag. Hey, Dance Bar. Will you do a little jig for me later? Buzz off, you jerk! You didn't forget Lesson No. 2. Yes. Listen and react at the same time. Not one after the other. Good. What we'll be doing today is pretty much the same. Chaddi will give you small pieces of dough. Diesel will ring the bells. Listen to the sound of bells and hit. l'll do it. How do l know you are not looking? Chaddi... Take that. Now listen carefully and hit. Okay? Diesel... Listen. Listen. Did l hit? - No, no... You hit it! You hit it. Did l hit? At the right spot. Cut it out... Be careful, otherwise you'll break your face. What are you guys going to do? Here, smell this. Eww! What is it! Pomfret, tuna, salmon, prawns. Absolutely fresh. Did you smell it? This will come towards you. You have to smell it and dodge it. Okay? Let it come. Wait. Wait. C'mon. Smell it. Smell it. Now listen to its clucking and grab it. Listen to see, you'll see everything Grab life and hold on to it Listen to see, touch to see See what you haven't heard lf you see with your ears You'll see all the colours Feelings can see clearly Awaken those feelings in you You are your own support Banish all fear from your mind Your mind will be your eyes lf you have the fire to live Open your mind and let it see You saw with your ears. You saw with your nose. Now touch and see. Listen to the noise carefully Every sound is a story Listen to the sound of danger Before the thundering storm arrives The shadows will touch and tell you Who is close to you and who is not This darkness is your friend now Hold the hand of the night There goes the breeze Go tickle it a little bit Be careful The sun has scattered the rainbow so neatly The warm quilt of the cool shade Don't let it go There goes the breeze Go tickle it a little bit Be careful The sun has scattered the rainbow so neatly Life is calling out to you Why are you shying away? Catch the rhythm of your heartbeat Good morning, sir. Morning, Sethna. Have a seat. File this. What's the progress on the Walia murder case? lnvestigation is going on, sir. l was a bit busy with the Pinky Palkar case. No, shut that. But sir someone else also is... Sethna, try to understand. The media is hounding me for the Walia murder case. Sir... - Just shut the file! That's all. Okay, sir. You may go. And submit the Walia case report by tomorrow morning. Yes, sir. Hello. Usman, salaam walekum. Sir, the Pinky Palkar case is supposed to be closed, right? l have opened the case. l'll be the one to close it. Someone seems to be in a hurry to close this case. Did you get any leads from the rickshaw stand? Yes, sir. A rickshaw driver dropped... ...a boy to the Bandra taxi stand that night. We are looking for the taxi driver. Don't involve anybody else, Kadam. ln fact, even you can withdraw from this case if you wish. lt's up to you. No, sir. l'll manage. Your audition day is coming closer. Who are you going to dance with? Should l get Shahid Kapoor? Nandu! Come. Hi, Pinky, how are you? What is he doing here? You were saying you are ready to skate dance, right? Yeah, so? So, we got him here. Pinky, l was thinking... why don't we come together again... Whoever has got you here, ask them to drop you home. l don't want any favours from you or anyone else. But, Pinky... - That's enough! Go. l am not interested in waiting here either. lf these guys hadn't forced me... Anyway, goodbye. You and your stupid waadi friends. What did you say! Get lost you bloody... What the hell do you want to do? Don't you want to dance? Dance comes from the heart. You can't beg for it. Beg, my foot! What do you think? We are all doing you a favour? l am doing you a favaour? Gulkand, Diesel, Chaddi, they are all doing you a favour?! Friends don't do favours. What the hell do you want? Tell me once and for all. l am losing it! You'll skate with me. What! You...will skate with me. Me? You want me to play wheelie with you! She's lost it. Not just skate. You will also dance with me. l am a disco dancer. Nandu...and dance! Enough. You think l am mad? Have l lost it to dance with you! People who lose it, make it big. And the so-called smarter ones play carom in the waadi. Their smartness is good enough only to woo girls or suck up to someone. Diesel sucks up to you, you suck up to that Usman. Don't ever do the madness of doing something else. By the way, you were the one preaching about being possessed, right? That to make it big you have to be possessed enough. l am possessed about being mad. The question is...what do you want to be? Smart... ...or mad. A game with danger is their whim They play fair; they play dirty, these wild birds What stands between pain and glory is... ...a word called guts. lf a man has guts he can find glory in pain. But these guts can be bloody dreadful... ...when people start taking you for a ride. And you let them. Where's the fighter from? l'll handle it. Hey, Nandu! l'll send you some Pav Bhaji with Chintu. Make sure you have it. Nandu? Yeah? What's with the silent treatment? lt's okay if you don't want to skate. But at least speak to me. Sometimes l feel like strangling her. Yeah, okay. Nandu! There's a parcel for you. What is it? - See it for yourself. What are you doing here? Right now l am standing here. But l plan to come up. And how will you do that? l guess l'll just use my legs, you fool! Now give me a hand. That was quick! Take this. l am leaving. Drop that aunty home later. Go call your mom aunty! Buzz off! There's just no value for respect these days. Food...for you. What's with the food business? No reason. Just to cheer you up. lt's useless. Nandu, don't skate if you don't want to. Why take it out on food? Here... Okay, l am leaving. Yeah, okay. l am really leaving... Jump from the right. There's grass there. You jerk! l burnt my hand to make chapattis for you and you want to act smart, huh? Shut up and eat now. Do you see the moon? Yeah. ls it a half or a full moon? lt's a half-full moon. Half-full? Half-full...a little more than half but not full yet. And clouds? Clouds in the night? There must be some around the half-full moon. Yeah. Who can you see in them? - What?! Haven't you ever seen faces in the clouds? You know, if you keep staring at the clouds for a long time, you see faces. A crooked-nosed magician, a kid sitting below an umbrella... ...a long trunked Ganpati (lndian God)... Who can you see now? A dhoti clad fatso with a moustache... Looks like he's going to eat the half-full moon. Didn't l tell you, you see faces... Pinky... ...why do you want to skate with me? Because l trust you. You'll skate with me for friendship...not out of pity. Did the fatso eat the half-full moon? Fernandez uncle! My shoe size is 9. Arrange for wheels my size. Let's start skate practice from tomorrow. What? l can't eat burnt chapattis every day. Are you ready? Get up. C'mon. Nandu, you okay? Easy, easy. Give me a hand. Careful. This is a piece of cake. Piece of cake... Leave my hand. Why do l need training for this? Nandu! Diesel, give me a hand. Diesel, let go. Let go. Lesson No. 1. Learn to land before you fly. C'mon. lt's done. Get up, give me your hand. Jump. - Hmm? Jump. Jump. Use the break. One. Two. Three. Use the break, Nandu! l will. - Let's try again. One. Two. Three. Leave my hand. One. Two. Three. Try again. l'll teach you a new step today. Watch carefully. First go like this, then like this, then like this... Now show me. Guys, hold me, it's ripping off... My pants are ripping off! There go his pants. Lesson No. 2. Stretch only as much as your pants can take. What did l teach you? First like this, then like this... Like this, then like this...Correct. Shut down your game. Go home. Yes, sir. Last board. Sir, that fighter. So fighter, you quit the ring and joined a circus, is it? Go home. Get lost. Sir, we found the taxi driver. l am sure you haven't disturbed me to tell me just that. Yes, sir. He dropped that boy in Mahim. ln front of Usman Ali's house. Usman Ali? That gambling king? - Yes, sir. Good one, Kadam. This boy will lead us to Usman. You are right, sir. At least clap if you liked it. C'mon, wear your skates. Okay, let's go. Hold properly. You are a holding a dead rat or what?! Give your hand. Now tell me the way. Right. Left, left. Sorry. Where are you, huh? Right here. Why? l can hear a train chugging in there. Oh that! That's because of the fight tonight. Oh really? Have you ever thought about a fight before? Nandu, who are you thinking of? My heart is such a brat lt follows only its mind lt pays no heed to me Though it claims to be mine ln the mist of your thoughts it's always lost No matter what l say, it just slips and falls Love comes at a price But it pays it anyway My heart is such a brat lt follows only its mind Wonder why it pines for melancholy Wishing for a new ailment Sleepless eyes lay awake in restless nights Every moment feels like a burden so heavy Floating like a butterfly lt follows only your footsteps lts blood boiling like hot passion This brat rejoices for no rhyme or reason ln the mist of your thoughts it's always lost No matter what l say, it just slips and falls Love comes at a price But it pays it anyway My heart is such a brat lt follows only its mind Wonder what it's looking for at the horizon Wandering like a bird in the land of clouds Basking in your sweet smell alone Simmering like the flame of love lt melts only with your sweet voice lt dissolves like sugar does in tea Where would you find a heart as crazy as this But all is fair in love, oh yes, it is ln the mist of your thoughts it's always lost No matter what l say, it just slips and falls Love comes at a price But it pays it anyway My heart is such a brat lt follows only its mind Hello? Yeah, Qasim Bhai? Did you get through? Yes. He's coming in 10 minutes. Where the hell was he? He's busy practising skating with that girl these days. Practicing what? That thing, Bhai, where you put wheels on your feet and you glide. Yeah, yeah, l know, l know. That twit has grown wings. Qasim, who's he? Max...a boxer from Vasai. l had warned Nandu about him. Monday! Monday! Audition dates. Next Monday, it is. What are you saying! ls everything ready? Nandu's right skate is a bit loose. You are right. lt is loose. We'll get it fixed from Shakeel. But makeup? Who'll do that? Sweetheart! You take care of that. Buzz off! - And what about costumes? Yeah, you'll need swanky costumes for the audition. You guys don't worry about that. Just get the fabric. That Usha store around the corner...one of my babes works there. 'One of your babes', is it? No, no, no. No, no, she's my sister, l swear! He won't change! Hi, Nandu. Here, Pinky, prashad (religious offering) Sai Baba, please save us Don't worry, you guys are going to be rocking today. Nandu, now everything is in your hands. Not in his hands. ln his feet. Shut up. l'll go see what's happening downstairs. Listen, Nandu, audience votes is the most important thing. Whoever has the most votes will soar... There are three types of audiences... One, is the housewife...how to impress her? For her, your expression should be just like the characters in a daily soap. Second, is the dude who goes to the gym. For him, you should flaunt your muscles. Third, is the young college girl. She's already in your pocket. Don't overact, otherwise she'll slip away. Shut up! Ajay and his babe are here to play wheelie. - So? The channel guy said that only one couple amongst you can be selected. But why? - Because both of you have the same talent. C'mon now. Nandu, be careful. This is not Dandiya. And smile when you enter. lgnore him. Nandu, all the best. Same to you. Damn, Nandu! l had told you, he is good for nothing but Dandiya! Shut up! How did you trip man? He didn't trip on purpose. l am not saying that. - Then why did you ask? One thing at practice, something else at the show. lt happens. lt doesn't work that way, man... Hello? Nandan Kamtekar. Yes? Yeah. Okay. We are selected. What?! lt was the channel guy. We are selected. Madam, Diwali offer! Buy one, get one free. Who's the king of Mumbai?! Babloo Mane! Come here...come here you twit! l am going to get you today. Careful. Careful. Chaddi! You didn't get any other car to come under? No, Bhai, we were just fooling around. lt's difficult to meet you even on Diwali? No, Bhai, l was a little busy. Busy? So busy that you don't even have time to give me a hug? Happy Diwali! She's the same girl, right? Yes, Bhai. Pinky, this is Usman Bhai. Salaam walekum. Sit, sit. Hope everything's fine. - Yes. lf you need anything, just let me know. Looks like you guys have become friends, huh? Yes, Bhai... Good. C'mon, Diesel. Let me catch up with the waadi people. And, Nandu. Enough of being busy now. Come early this Friday. Okay? C'mon, Diesel. Looks like you guys have become friends (mockingly) Sshhh! He'll hear you. Why? You are scared you'll lose your job? l fight of my own will. Oh really? Then don't go this Friday. We'll practise till late. Nandu, for how long will you live like this...from Friday to Friday? Have you ever thought of the future? What's there to think? Don't you plan to do a job or something? l don't need your lecture now! l am telling you as a friend. lf you think it's lecturing, then so be it. This 'One Shot Nandu' is only good to look at... ...not to live with. Tomorrow if you feel like settling down with some girl... ...no girl will want to be with a boy... ...who breaks someone's face for a living. So what kind of a boy will a girl like to be with? Girls are very smart nowadays. Gone are the days of falling for cute faces. These days only if you have a house, a good job, is there any chance... Otherwise, go fly a kite! Got it? C'mon. Let's burst some crackers. C'mon! Give me a biscuit - Chacha... Please have it. There he is. Done? - Yeah. Rahim Chacha, one special. Say something! Did they hire you? Yeah. 15000 bucks a month. That means you'll take up a job? That too of a bouncer? l have a job with Usman too, don't l? But you command respect there. They call you 'One Shot'. People look up to you. You saw what happened with Anna, right? Does anybody respect him now? That's because he hit Pinky. lf l stay in this line, even l'll hit a Pinky some day. l have fed this devil enough. Kudroos Miyaa, he won't have any more now. There he escapes. He won't come back now . Qasim, that boxer from Vasai...call him tomorrow. Looks like l'll have to create another 'One Shot' But, Bhai, he's lost to Nandu twice. That's good. Anger makes a man do many things. And this thing...'love'... just ruins everything. That was close! - A little more practice and you'll crack it. Don't worry too much. Drop me to the disco... Excuse me! Where are you off to? Don't you know? Our Nandu has a job now. - What! Senior bouncer...15000 bucks a month. You go ahead, l'll come. He's blushing! How much more time is it going to take? Baby (mockingly)...here, have a banana. Why are you worrying so much? We are definitely in the final five. Nobody will dare chuck us out. Nandu...tell me something... How come you took on this job? ls it about some girl? Why should it be about some girl? l felt like it, l tried. Hmmm... What else did you feel like? Don't bug me! You have the hots forTina, right? Have you lost it?! No, she's not your type. Oh yes! Ekta, from Paul classes? Right? Guys! Come quickly. l know who she is... He thinks too much of himself. Wants to become Usman's right hand... ...and take Anna's place. What does he call himself? Fighter! This is what a fighter is! Kadam Sir, your glass is empty. You guys carry on. l'll go take a leak. Now, that is very important. Fill his glass. Nandu. His name is Nandan Kamtekar. Nandu! Nandu! You bonehead! Why don't you answer your phone? Has your father ever answered his phone while bathing! Don't drag my father in this. Come and pick me up at 12. We are going to watch a movie. Are you drunk or what! You fool! Pinky asked me to say all this. Here, take the Pepsi. l'll hold the popcorn. What's with this movie plan all of a sudden? Just like that. We could have asked the rest of the gang to join us. Such a sudden... Why? You are afraid l'll feel you up in the dark? Hero and heroine are in a car... lt's raining outside... A song is playing on the radio... l am not deaf! The hero is coming closer to the heroine... The heroine is coming closer to the hero... Hero is about to... You didn't get any other film? - Why? l mean...it's not decent. Nandu! What are you doing man! What do you mean? l am watching the movie and telling you about it. You think l have got you here to watch the movie! No? l am visually challenged. He is mentally challenged. The hero has now left with the car. Left to you, you won't utter a word for the rest of your life! About what... - Will you shut up for some time? l...l love you. Hey, One Shot Nandu. There's no compulsion, don't worry. Otherwise you'll think that the blind girl is piling on. Pinky...l am not used to goodness. Don't get me used to it. You already are, One Shot Nandu. Now shut up and hold my hand. Hold it! We'll paint the town with the colour of our style We'll punch a hole in the sky Set the ocean on fire On the shoulder of death make a tattoo of life We are wild birds l knew it right since Pinky was a little girl that she'll make us proud. l prayed at Mahalakshmi (lndian Goddess) so she got through the first round. For the third round, l'll go to Siddhivinayak (lndian God) We'll colour the moon red And the sky green The colour that we point at ls the right colour We'll pluck all the stars And lay them on the ground We'll crown the horizon with our shadow We'll switch the sun off with just a blow Wow! What coordination! Nandu's lift was also superb! Pinky's an absolute bombshell on TV! May God protect her from the evil eye. This is it. l have the names of the 5 teams that have made it to... ...the finals of lndia's Got Talent. Without any more delays... Ladies and gentlemen... Our first finalist is...Aarti Kapoor and Arpita Mitra from Kolkata. Second finalist...Kaitkey Sood from Kota. Our third finalist...from Mumbai... Nandu, you have to win the finals, come what may. Yes, Chacha. You have become a film star, man! You dance, you fight! l think l'll quit fighting. What! What? Usman Bhai will let you go? l'll speak to him before the next fight. Let's see what he says. Okay bye. You don't ever take a bath but l do. Add it to our account. Yeah. Yes, Kadam? Done with your jogging? Last lap. So, what's the verdict? Fingerprints match, sir. Great. So finally we've got Usman, huh? Bhai...l want to talk to you... Yeah sure. What is it? Qasim, the senator is going to come. Make sure everything is in order. - Yes, Bhai. l'll see where Chaddi and Gulkand are. Now tell me. What is this private talk that you want to have? Where does Pinky Palkar live? There. That's the house. There? - Yes, sir. Bhai, l was thinking... What? You don't want to fight? l mean...today's fight will be my...last fight. Very good. Anyway the senator is coming today. We'll felicitate you. One Shot Nandu retires from the fighting ring. We'll also get a few news channels to cover it. Mom, l am leaving. Pinky? - Who is it? Pinky Palkar? - Yes. l am lnspector Keki Sethna. Has Rakesh done something? No. l want to speak with you. With me? - lt's important... About your accident. You want to quit? Huh? Go ahead. But as Nandu...not as One Shot. What do you mean? l mean One Shot has to die today. You have to lose today's fight. What are you saying, Bhai? l know what l am saying. l have a business to run. This is not some roadside bar that anyone can stop... ...have a few drinks and then go home thinking he's conquered the world! lf that boxer from Vasai beats you, then people will bet on him. The business should go on...and it will go on. Some new facts about your accident have surfaced. This file has evidence of the person who actually hit you that night. There's no question of losing, Bhai. What? How dare you defy Usman? l took you in from the gutters! You think you are a big star just now that you do your jigs on TV? lf l hadn't covered up that girl's accident case... ...you would be lying in jail... ...warming some gangster's bed. lf you hadn't covered up the accident, everybody would know... ...that you hired Anna to kill Yadav. So, you do have a brain. Listen, that blind babe of yours... who you are in love with... l'll tell her who made her blind. This file has all the proof. Nandan Kamtekar's fingerprints which we found on the car's steering wheel. We also have a witness who saw him driving that night. We have a case here. ls this a mistake? Nobody's out here to frame Nandu. ln fact someone's tried hard to save him. Usman Ali has bribed to close this file. This is not an official investigation. My junior and l have done it. So you know Anna is not responsible for your accident...it is Nandu. You can have a lawyer check the file if you wish. She loves you a lot, right? Why are you screwing her life to keep One Shot alive, you jerk! What do you expect from me? Co-operation. Pinky, are you okay? Splash some water on your face and come. Pinky, you don't need eyes to see. You need to be possessed. Looks like you guys have become friends. Not just skate. You will also dance with me. You'll skate with me for friendship...not out of pity. Have l lost it to dance with you! People who lose it, make it big. Anna is not responsible for your accident...it is Nandu. How much did you win? - 15000! There he is. Take me to him. Nandu! What are you guys doing here? What's wrong? A cop had come from the police station. They found your fingerprints on the steering wheel. Anna didn't screw my life. You did, Nandu! All that help, love...everything was a bloody joke. You just took pity on me, didn't you? Answer me. Answer me! You love to play God, huh? First you make a girl blind. Then you take pity on her and make her life. You call yourself my friend! You and l are over, One Shot Nandu. For the first time l loved someone with all my heart. But my bloody fate! Pinky, listen to me... Let's go, Chaddi. Diesel, let's go. What do you want to be? A friend or a suck-up? Chaddi, let's go. You bloody suck-up. Why didn't you tell her? What's the point now? Eyes with wings full of hope and light Will wash away the darkness and shine on bright And if ever so ever they well up with rain They'll silently weep and smile through pain ln the blink of an eye they'll fly away Forget their pain and smile all the way Helpless they are not These dreamy eyes. Eyes with wings Two crazy eyes How the hell did this happen? What about the show tomorrow? You guys have reached the finals for God's sake! Your dream... your passport out of here... l'll do it alone. Alone? Are you out of your mind? The channel guys will never agree. l didn't reach here to watch the finals on TV. l will dance. And l'll dance alone. Nobody has the balls to stop me. You guys are still not in the wings! Where's Nandu? - He's coming. You go... Guys, we are rolling in 5. Think again, Pinky. You guys keep lying to them till l go on stage. Pinky, please... - Tina! Coming up next are the dashing Nandu and the blind beauty on skates. Pinky Palkar! Where's Nandu? - l don't know. Why the hell are you here? - Pinky, don't stop. Why are you here? Don't let one Nandu come in the way of your dream. You wanted to be mad, right? Show them what madness is. Let's dance in such a way, Pinky... ...that nobody will dare stop us from winning. C'mon! What a brilliant performance! The folks from Tilakwaadi.... Tilakwaadi! The folks from Tilakwaadi are mighty excited as you can see... And why not! lt was such a brilliant performance Let's see what our judges have to say. Did you get through mom? No, we'll call her. You call the drummers, man. You want to dance again! - Just see how Tilakwaadi... Diesel...where's Nandu? He left. - Left? Where? To work. - He's mad! You are right. Pinky managed to make him mad, after all. Diesel! He was getting thrashed. He left with his head hanging low... ...right in front of the same people who once treated him like God. Nandu... - He lost the fight. Nandu lost the fight?! And we didn't even get to know. lt's not a TV show that the whole waadi will come to know. How? Usman forced Nandu to lose. He threatened to tell Pinky everything. Nandu was scared... Not because he'll lose the fight... Because he'll lose Pinky... He loves you a hell lot, Pinky. You wanted him to be mad, right? There. He's mad about you! Pathak! ls it clear upstairs? Yes, Nandu. Good night. You got change for 10 bucks? What are you doing here, Pinky? You know what, Nandu... ...l kept asking myself just one thing after the accident. Why was l in front of that car that night! Now l know why. You didn't mess up my life on purpose. But if l wouldn't have come back today... ...l would have messed both our lives on purpose. l realized one thing in the past two days. You made me blind...but you taught me how to see with my heart. l don't want to be blind again. When you are with me, you make me want to see. l want to see this world with you, Nandu. Will you see it with me? You blind pile on! ldiot! The winners of lndia's Got Talent are Nandu and Pinky! Oh! So, it's a love story. Pinky, you can go home. Thank you, sir. lsnt't it good when a close one is also close by? Yes, sir. C'mon, let's drink to that. We'll deal with Usman later.
