In the blink of an eye, something happens by chance, when you least expect it... ...sets you on a course that you never planned... ...into a future you never imagined. Where will it take you? That's the journey of our lives. Our search for the light. But sometimes... ...finding the light means you must pass through the deepest darkness. At least, that's how it was for me.

But I feel like there's this debt that I have to pay. I don't know where I belong. I guess I should figure that out. Um... I know there's no easy answer, sis... but maybe all I need is time. LOGAN: any chance gnu recognize that girl? No, I'm sorry. Not in the boat region. Good luck. Thank you. [MAN SINGING OVER SPEAKERS] BARTENDER: Hey, Roger? Guy wants to know who this girl is.

Zeus. - Oh, he's a sweetheart. - He's good with people. Well, better than I am. BETH: Well, at least you don't introduce yourself to the animals before their owners. - I'm Beth' - Logan. Um... So I, uh, came here [CELL PHONE RINGS] Excuse me for a second. Hello? Oh, hi, Mrs. Jackson. Come on.

Okay, see you then. Bye. It's Beth. Yes, we do train. We're full service. I'm so sorry. Just bring in Napoleon's papers and any dietary restrictions that he might have. - Monday is great. Bye. ELLIE: Oscar, get up here. Well, Zeus is way too well behaved to need training... ...so I'm guessing that you're here to board him? No, I'm not going anywhere. I just got off the road yesterday. Where from? Colorado. And what brings you to Hamden? It's kind of a long story. Actually, I don't really know where to begin. Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry. That's absolutely none of my business. Um... What can I do for you, Logan? I'm really here because I came to see you. You see, I found this. Oh. it was just-- Oh, you saw the ad. Of course. Okay. So the job doesn't-- It doesn't pay much. Um. mostly you'll just be walking... ...feeding, cleaning cages. It's six days a week. Zeus is welcome anytime. And help, Logan. That's the job. We just need some help. ELLIE: Oscar. Get up here. Up. Come on. Can I borrow your pen? So besides Zeus, do you have any experience with working with dogs? I worked with some bomb dogs. - Oh. So you were a cop-- - A Marine. You know what? You don't need to finish filling that out. Just leave me a number where I can reach you and I will call and let you know. Sounds like you're having trouble finding someone for the job. Why does a person drive from Colorado to Louisiana to work in a dog kennel? I couldn't tell you. I walked. You walked? You walked here from Colorado? I like to walk. Would you excuse me for a minute, please? You are such a stubborn boy. Get up here. Come on. You can do this. There's a good-- Unh! - Did you take your medication? - Oh, I'm still pumping on all cylinders. That's all that matters, so... What is it? There's a man here who came to apply for the job and I can't get rid of him. [ROOF CREAKS] He looks harmless. BETH: He walked here from Colorado. - Oh? Tell him you hired somebody else or something. Why do I have to tell him? You're the one that doesn't want him. Do you want to hire a crazy person? Are you crazy? I beg your pardon, ma'am? My granddaughter thinks you might be. No, ma'am. Yeah, well, you look like a sharp, capable young man. You tell me why there's a sharp, capable young man wanting a job cleaning cages. [ZEUS BERKS] Because it seems like peaceful work. My last job wasn't. Oh, where were you? Wall Street? No, ma'am. I was in the Marine Corps. [DOGS BARKING] Ah. Marine Corps. [ZEUS BARKING] LOGAN: Hey. Down. - Train him yourself? - Yes, ma'am. Hmm. You're a good boy. How'd you get him to leave? - I gave him the job. - You what? Well, we gotta hire somebody. You don't know anything about him. Neither do you. MAN: Just needs a little tender loving care. I'll take it. MAN: I got tools and lumber and the like. You're welcome to them. LOGAN: Thanks, [CHUCKLES] BETH: Come on. You know, you don't need to be here until 7:30, I couldn't sleep. Figured I'd get an early start. ELLIE: Well, we had a whale of a storm. That lovely thing came down. That's where we store everything up there, - Teslin. Here's your new boss. LOGAN: Hey, boy. Hey, boy. BETH: You ready to go? - Who's that? Thais just somebody that Nana hired. - Aren't you forgetting something? - Oh, BETH: Come on, baby, we don't want to be late. Dad doesn't like it when I practice in the house. BETH: So maybe you can practice on the porch. ELLIE: The little one. LOGAN: Hey. How you doing? BETH: I put Duckie in your backpack for tonight. [DOGS BARKING] [ENGINE SPUTTERING] BETH: What's he doing? Can you believe that he got that old thing going? Oh, good Lord. You know, I'm substituting for Julie next week. It's only a couple days, but... Why don't you go back full-time? It's been almost a year. I know how long it's been. [DOGS BARKING] Do you think that he has an off switch? I hope not. Ha-ha-ha. [DOGS BARKING] [CAR APPROACHING] Can I help you? The hell you doing around here? Is there a problem, officer? There will be, you don't answer my questions when I ask them. I work here. [SCOFFS] Put your hands on that bench. Ahem. Why? Boy, you wanna do this at the station? A soldier boy? "Sergeant Logan Thigh-bolt." It's Thibault. - And I'm a Marine. - Mm-hm. Well, where's everyone at, Thigh-bolt? They're all out. Do you want me to give Beth a message? Oh-ho. So it's Beth, is it? You just tell Beth I'll see her at 4. [KEITH WHISTLING] [VACUUM WHIRRING] You should come. You never know, you might have fun. You've always loved their house. - Save your breath. I'm not going. - Why not?

Makes me wish I never would have signed those papers. [BETH SQUEALS] Tell me about your new boyfriend. BETH: What? - Soldier boy, huh? BETH: Don't ask me about him. I didn't hire him. - He has nothing to do with me. - Okay. Okay. [KEITH CHUCKLES] KEITH: Hey, Mama. Place is looking great. CHARLOTTE: You look beautiful.

That's it, boy, get it, get it. Pick it up. Come on. Oh! Whoa! [DOG WHIMPERS] [LAUGHING] BETH: That man is so irritating. Every time I turn around he's just- - Uh, uh, uh. - Good morning. ELLIE: Mm. So you were saying? LOGAN: We moved around a lot, so I kind of grew up everywhere, and nowhere. ELLIE: Oh, that must have been hard, huh? Changing schools, leaving friends. LOGAN: It was okay. It was all I knew. - Mm. But you went to college? Yes, ma'am. Just for a year. What'd you study? He didn't study much if it was just for a year. ELLIE: Elizabeth Green. - I liked philosophy. ELLIE: Really? Yeah, I like to read. Give us a quote of your favorite philosopher. "Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple." ELLIE: Hmm. - Don't tell me. Voltaire? It's Voltaire, isn't it? It's Dr. Seuss. [ELLIE CHUCKLES] Thank you very much the tea, Mrs. Green. I should get back to work. Will you call me "Ellie," for goodness sake? Voltaire. [ELLIE CHUCKLES] BETH: What sound does a tiger make? [ALL GROWLING] "This lazy ladybug didn't know how to y." I wanna turn the page. You can turn the page next. "One day the lazy ladybug wanted to sleep somewhere else." Oh, this looks great, you guys. Ah. That's beautiful. Julie's not coming back after she has the baby. We'd really like lo have you back full-time. I can't right now, Rhonda. I'm sorry. A violin? A violin'? Only girls play violins. Don't you play, like, basketball or something? BOY 1: Oh, fine. The girl wants back his violin. BOY 2: It's his mom. Let's go. Let's go. Hey. You Okay? [VIOLIN PLAYING] LOGAN: Not bad. BEN: I didn't think anyone was listening. Glad I was. BETH: That's perfect.

Can you drive? Beth's outwith a friend and my ride to choir practice just fell through. My bossy granddaughter won't let me drive since I-- Well, you can hardly even call it a stroke. It's more like a tap, really. Heh. - Hasn't slowed me down in the slightest. - I can see that, ma'am. - How old are you, dear? - Twenty-five. How many tours? Three. My grandson never finished his second. Yeah. You would've liked him. You two, you were cut of the same cloth. You know, you live long enough, Logan, you lose enough people... ...you learn to appreciate the memories you have. Stop begrudging the ones you never got to make. Beth hasn't lived as long as I have. She isn't as bad as she seems. She doesn't seem so bad to me. LOGAN: Hello? [DOOR CLOSES] [PIANO PLAYING] [PIANO CONTINUES PLAYING] BETH: All right, thank you. I'll see you later.

You got dance moves? - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah, what you got? Whoo-hoo. [BEN LAUGHS THEN WHOOPS] BEN: Mom ran track. She was super-fast. BETH: Cross-country, I wasn't that good. Is that why you got a scholarship to Tulane? Because you weren't any good? Okay. Once upon a time I was pretty good. Are you happy? LOGAN: You went to Tulane? No, State to be close to home. Had some personal stuff come up. She got pregnant. With me. BETH: Well, thank you, Benjamin. Isn't it your night for the dishes? Thank you. LOGAN: Do you still run competitively? Oh, no, no, no. Now I just do it to clear my head. It's a lot cheaper than therapy, so... So is walking. - Who plays chess? - Me. Me too. Bet I can beat you. - What's the bet? - Dishes tonight. Dishes tonight, against the pauper scooper tomorrow. Gotta warn you, I'm not bad. Check. [IMITATES ENGINE REWING] Let's do a ip. Oh, that was cool. Wheelie. Somersault. Checkmate. Detergent is under the sink. LOGAN: What? Did I just get hustled? Have to admit, I played better the second time. BEN: Sure. Until your second move. You have any other secret talents I should know about? You're the one with the secret. I saw him playing the piano. Really? Yeah. I saw it when I put the keys back. He's really good. Hey, you're not too bad yourself. - Why don't you play something for us? - How about a magic trick instead? Yeah, okay. He hates playing for people. He doesn't think that he's good enough. Hmm. Ordinary deck. Wow, okay, cool. - Oh. It's all right. - Ha-ha. Show me again. - Tell me when to stop. - Stop. Memorize the card, and I am not looking. Okay, I got it. Let me give it a little magic. LOGAN: Wow. - I didn't know you were a magician too. - Wait till you see this one. Ben, sweetie, ifs past your bedtime. - Wait, this is the best one. - Show me tomorrow. Ben, say good night to Logan, now. - Come on. - No. I just wanted to show him a trick. I'm sorry. He's not usually-- It's fine. It's fine. My brother taught him a few tricks. Magic was kind of their thing. We lost him last year. He was a Marine too. It's been hard on Ben. It's been hard on all of us. [DOGS BARKING] [GROUP SINGING IN DISTANCE] ELLIE: Thank you. GROUP & ELLIE [SINGING]: We share [SINGING INDISTINCTLY] Well, I'm glad you came. ELLIE Uh! - Ho-ho. Whoo! Ha-ha. BETH: Oh.,.. Aren't you helpful, dear, and chivalrous? You are so--?

Look, there's something that I've been meaning to tell you. I never fully explained how-- And I'm sorry, I can't find the right words. It's all right. Another time, maybe. After all, I'm not going anywhere. Okay. Good night, Logan. [DOOR CLOSES] [GRUNTS] [GASPING] [BETH GRUNTS] [DOGS BARKING] No. No! Jesus! No! [SOBS] LOGAN: Beth! Beth! No! Stop it! [SOBBING] No. LOGAN: It's okay. It's okay. BETH: At first they wouldn't tell us anything. Just that friendly fire was a possibility. So it's a year ago today... ...and the official investigation into the death of Sergeant... ...Drake... ...Green... ...is still ongoing. That's the worst part. Not knowing. I would give anything... I would give anything to know that he didn't die for nothing. We were inseparable as kids, you know? We did everything together. We even built that wall together. Well, Drake built the wall... ...and I supervised... ...which consisted mostly of drinking iced teas and reading the Bronts. [LAUGHS] Oh. This one day... ...I couldn't find my book anywhere. So I asked him about it. And he just pointed. Look. Look. God, I was so mad. I was so mad at him. And he just laughed. [LAUGHING] It was-- [SOBS] BETH: I'm sorry. LOGAN: It's okay. You got a great laugh, you know that? I wish I could hear it more. Why don't you try telling me a joke? Because you're gonna have to get a few beers in me before I start telling you jokes. Okay. -Okay. -Okay. "--Except for Ron and Hermione's slow, deep breathing. Harry glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the oor beside him. Ron had had a fit of..." Mom. - Mom, - Yes. "On the sofa. Hermione's..." "--So that her silotee..." Silhouette. Come on, Brutus. Hi, buddy. [BRUTUS WHIMPERING] All right. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Ha-ha. Oh, come on. 'What-? [LAUGHS] Shake. [GRUNTING] Wa-yaah! What's the black dog tag for? This one's mine, and the black one is in memory of my best buddy, Victor. So they're like friendship bracelets. Yeah. Yeah, you could say that. No-- Oh, man, he's toast. - Your turn. - Don't. No. LOGAN: Where you going? Hey. You can run, man, I'm gonna make a Marine out of you. [BOTH LAUGHING] [DOGS BARKING] [LAUGHS] [INDISTINCT DIALOGUE] [HORN HONKING] LOGAN: Get over. Go through. Up! See. I've been working on my pop-ups all week, KEITH: All right. That's my boy. BETH: There you go. Get in the car. LOGAN: See. - How's old Thigh-Bolt working out for you? - Do me a favor, okay'? Try and remember this is a charity game. What the hell's that supposed to mean? Don't push him too hard, okay? Hey, you know what? When Benny's on your time, you guys do what you want. You can plant your owers, you can do your crochet, play the fiddle, whatever. When he's with me we do it my way. - Have fun, sweetie. Seat belt. - Bye, Mom. - Need to give the kid some room to breathe. [WHISPERS] I'm okay. [DOGS BARKING] No. Cooper. Cooper, stop. [BAND PLAYING "DANCE EVERYDAY"] That's $9. Thank you. BETH: I'm gonna get going. I'll be back later to help you pack up. [DOGS BARKING] Hey. What's up? KEITH: Unh, There you go. BETH: Oh. - What happened? BEN: We won! Oh, he took his eye off a ground ball. It's not as bad as it looks. He just got a little nosebleed. I still stopped it. Got my glove down, kept my body in front. Only one run scored. Ha, ha. It was the play of the game. Tell you what, might make a man out of him yet. Why don't you go on inside? Take a shower. I'll be right there. - See you later, buddy. BEN: Bye, Dad. What? It was an accident. You really don't see it. See what? That boy would run through a brick wall for you, What does that gotta do with him not being able to field a ground ball? - Huh? - Okay. Don'! worry about it. Please go home, Keith. Hey, wait a second. Hey. Who do you think you're talking to, huh? Keith, calm down. You calm down. Let me tell you something. That's my son in there too, and I can take that boy anytime I want. You got that? Let go of my arm. Let go of my arm. - What's the matter? LOGAN: You should do as she says. Let go of her arm. BETH: God! [DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES] [DOGS BARKING] Gosh, I hope that this heals up before your birthday. Your friends' parents are going to think that I beat you. I don't have to have a party. Dad says I'm kind of getting old for them. That is ridiculous. Of course you're gonna have a party. You only turn 8 once. You only turn every age once. Shower. Now. [SHOWER RUNNING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] BETH: Thank you for that. He can'! really take Ben away from you, can he? You haven't met Keith's father. Why don't you just leave? If I tried to take Ben out of Hamden I could lose him altogether. LOGAN: It's none of my business, but how did you end up--? I mean, what- What possessed me to marry him? Picture this: Senior year, he was captain of the football team. I thought that I was in love, Then I got pregnant. He asked, I said yes. Only thing is, he didn't quite realize I expected him to stop dating. I don't want to go anywhere else. This is our home. Has been forever. Whatever else Keith may be, he'll always be Ben's dad. I just want to make sure you're okay. Thank you. See you in the morning. Come on, buddy. Come on. Hey! When are we gonna get those beers? I won't forget. BETH: It's just a casual beer between coworkers. Mm-hm. It's not a date. Oh. Did I say anything? [BEN MIMICS PLANE FLYING] - Do you think life has a plan for you? - Oh, jeez. Do you? If it does, it hasn't shared it with me. Why did you enlist? It was the family business. Oh, I had you figured for a military brat. Your father was a Marine? And his dad before him. So you signed up for them? The first tour was for them. The second and third were for the guys that were still out there. What time do you think it is? Am I boring you? I want to show you something. Come on. We have to go now. BETH: This is where I come when I want to be alone. LOGAN: She's a beauty. BETH: Dad grew up around boats. He was a vet, but he loved to fish. Mom was a music teacher. She couldn't stand it, LOGAN: You've never mentioned your parents before. BETH: They died in a car accident when we were very young. LOGAN: Sorry, I was just- - It's a fair question. I guess that's why Drake and I were so close. We were so lucky to have Nana. Dad took Drake fishing all the time. When he taught him how to steer this thing, he couldn't have been more than 6 or 7. - What about you? - Oh. I love this boat. I know she doesn't look like much now, but she could really y. - Well, we should take her out sometime. - Oh, Can't even get her started now. LOGAN: That's too bad. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [BETH LAUGHING] Are you sure you're okay to drive? I'm perfectly sober, thank you very much. Hold on. [LOGAN SIGHS] [LOGAN CLEARS THROAT] You do realize we're gonna have to do this all again? You never told me that joke. Is there any way I can make it up to you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's been so long. - God. - It's all right. You should be kissed every day every hour, every minute. Keith? Oh, Danny. What the hell do you think you're doing? Put that down. You know y'all were doing 50 through town? Oh, like hell we were. Keith put you up to this, didn't he? - Didn't he? - Beth, you need to go home. - Oh. - Let's just say it never happened. BETH: No. - Sony. BETH: No, it's me that's sorry. [DOGS BARKING] [SIGHS] [GASPS] Well, that's as clean as it'll ever be. [POT BANGS] [SQUEALS] [MAYFIELD'S "WASTED GENERATION" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] [GRUNTS] Please go. [LIGHT BUZZING] [MUSIC STOPS] Oh, shit. [CLOCK CHIMING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] LOGAN: Ben. [DOGS BARKING] You know, you should read this when I'm done. I think it could really help you. Who says I need any help? My undefeated record. Oh, is that so? - Guess you're looking for Mom. - What makes you think that? She's in the barn. Ben? Light. What are you-? I just wanted to stop by and make sure you're okay. You just wanted to stop by? - How mysterious. - Okay. I wanted to see you. [BETH MOANS] BEN: Mom. What is it, sweetie? The ice cream is melting. Can I just eat it? Just put it in a bowl first. BEN: Okay. [BOTH PANTING AND MOANING] Feel like some ice cream? [DOGS BARKING] LOGAN: Come on. Yeah. Let's see what you got. [ALL LAUGHING] LOGAN: Yeah. Come on. [LAUGHS] [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] LOGAN: Yeah. Now it-- Perfect. Show me. Come on. Yeah. Champion. Go ahead, say it. Say what? Oh, don't be shy. You know you want to. "I told you so." There. Feel better? So you were right. Only thing is, it's not gonna work out. No guy could ever be this good. They never are. Eventually, it will end. Things will get awkward. He'll quit, Ben will be heartbroken, it will be my fault. Yeah. And he'll grow up hating you. He'll move far away, he'll never call. I'll be dead and you'll be alone. Forever. [CHUCKLES] BEN: Pick a card, any card. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] BEN: Tell me when to slop. Stop. BETH: I know. Just the turkey things, right on the counter next to the fridge, I think. Impressive trick. I'm gonna grab this from you. Oh! Excuse me. KEITH: What the hell's he doing here? Ben invited him. It's his party. [BANGS BOTTLE ON TABLE] You think I don't know what's going on around here? Hmm? I don't think I like you seeing him. Well, you don't have a say in it. I certainly have a say in who my son sees. Hmm? And if I was to say that his mom's unhealthy relationship... ...with some crazy drifter... ...was creating an unstable environment for my boy... ...I don't think there's a judge in the world who'd disagree with me. Certainly not in this town. [INHALES DEEPLY] [EXHALES] [KEITH GRUNTS] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR SLAMS] [GASPING] He wants you out of my life. I can't risk losing Ben. I'm sorry, Beth. I didn't come here to make things harder for you. You don't know what I'm dealing with. I do know that you deserve better than this. [KEITH WHISTLING] How you doing? You want a ride? What do you want? I wanna get you a job. You gotta be tired of cleaning up dog shit by now. Ha-ha-ha. I know some people. I could make a couple calls... ...and gel you something worthy of a veteran. What do you think? You don't know who you're dealing with. I know exactly who I'm dealing with. I've known guys like you my whole life. You think a gun and a badge and a name make you something. - You better watch your mouth. - I'm done talking to you. [CLOCK CHIMING] ELLIE: So are you planning to let him bully you all your life?

[DOGS BARKING] What's up? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [DOGS BARKING] - What do you want now, Keith? - I gotta talk to you. It's Sunday night. Can't this wait? No, Beth. Look, this is just strictly police business. Come on, Keith. Where did you get that? Your boy Logan had it. I take it you didn't give it to him. This was Drake's. [KEITH SIGHS] He didn't wander into town by chance, Beth, He came here to find you. When he first got here, he was asking all around about you... ...showing that picture to everybody. You know what they said about friendly fire... No. I'm not accusing anyone. I'm just saying that a guy like that... No friends, no people, just shows up here with something so personal? I mean, now, that just don't smell right to me. I've seen stalkers, I've seen how they think. And once they fixate on somebody... ...they're capable of anything. [DOG BARKING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] - Where did you get this? - I found it. This was Drake's. He took it everywhere with him. He told me. LOGAN: Listen to me. BETH: No, you listen to me. [VOICE BREAKING] You didn't come here by accident. You came here to find me. I know I should have told you. I tried. I didn't know how. Try telling me now. [VOICES WHISPERING IN LOGAN'S MIND] [SIGHS] LOGAN: Move! Move, move, move! [SOLDIERS YELLING] It was in the morning... ...after a night raid. I just found it. In the middle of nowhere. I tried to find out who lost it. I never stopped trying, but nobody claimed it. Finding something like that... ...in a war... ...was like finding an angel in hell. So I kept it with me. Then I survived a lot of things. Things that I had no right to. I promised myself that if I made it out... ...I would find that girl... ...and thank her... ...for saving my life... ...when others weren't so lucky. But I couldn't find the words. How do you explain something that you can't even understand yourself? Understand this: This was Drake's. It was meant to keep him alive. I wish it had. I wish it had. You should go. Now. BEN: Logan, wait. [DOGS BARKING] Oh, man. You sure? You need it more than I do. Take care of your mom, all right? BEN: I thought I was the guy next to you. LOGAN: You're my best buddy. I'll always be next lo you. Tell Zeus I said bye. [ENGINE REWING] - Here you go. - You're welcome. [OVER SPEAKERS] That's when you know KEITH: I tried to warn her. I tried to tell her he was no good. She didn't wanna listen to me. - About ready here, bud? KEITH: Mm' That's when you know Let's do it. MOORE: You ain't driving nowhere. KEITH: Oh. - And here's your change. KEITH: Yep. - Get your coat. - All right. Appreciate it, J.D. BARTENDER: Hey, no problem, man. - Thank you. KEITH: Whoo. [CHATTER OVER RADIO] Hey, hang on, man. Stop the car. - I think you need to let it go- - Hey, stop the goddamn car! MOORE: He ain't worth it. Shit. Hey. Hey, soldier boy. Don't you walk away from me when I talk to you. [ZEUS BARKING] Mm. MOORE: Keith, come on. You ain't got nothing to say for yourself? [ZEUS BARKING] LOGAN: Zeus! - Jesus. - Easy, boy. Easy. MOORE: Stand back. Stand back. Man, easy. MAN: Are you crazy? - Easy, MOORE: Come on, Keith. Put it down. - Shut up. Ah! MOORE: Hey. Hang on, bud. Hang on. You're not a bad guy, Keith. Zeus. Okay, folks. Let's go, let's move along. Everything's fine. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Could have killed him. I talked to Sheriff Grey. He gonna look the other way. Now, come on, Keith. Hey. You pull yourself together now, all right? Gonna be fine. Gonna be fine. Yep. It'll all blow over by the time the election rolls around. [DOGS BARKING] You're not the only one whose life got better when he came here. You might not believe it, but I think he was meant to find that photo. Right. Right. Of course. It was all part of a plan. None of us are in control of anything that happens. It's all down to fate. Well, you call it what you like, but I think it happened for a reason. [VOICE BREAKING] So you're saying." ...Drake died so that Logan could live? No. Honey. Oh, sweetheart. It's not Logan's fault that he survived. CASTRO: I'm on it, Aces. LOGAN: "Aces"? [GUNFIRE] LOGAN: Zeus, stay here. I'll be right back. [DOG BARKING] Keith? What are you doing? [DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] KEITH: I always loved these plates. What do you want, Keith? What do I want? I want... I just want us to be a family again. Please. Can we be a family again? I can change. I have, I've changed. I can make you happy, Beth. I can. I can make you happy again. Keith... I know you care about Ben... ...but it's not gonna happen for us. You have to let it go. Let it go. Why should I let it go? [FLOOR CREAKING] [SCOFFS] All right, maybe I should just go on and take Ben, now. Huh? Take him away for good. Can't say I didn't warn you. Why don'! I just take him right now? Where's he at? Benny. - Ben? Ben. - Ben. BEE; [THUNDER RUMBLING] Benny! Hey! Come back! - He's heading for the tree house. KEITH: Ben! Come back here! Ben! Ben! Ben!

[BEN SCREAMING] [TREE HOUSE CREAKING] - Dad! Dad! LOGAN: Almost there. [GASPING] LOGAN: I'm gonna go back for Keith. No! BEN: Dad! No! [BETH SCREAMING] JUDGE: Here, I don't want any problems down there. So keep this road clear so we can get these vehicles out of here, Bring it. Get back to the bridge, and make sure it's secure, all right? EMT: You're all good. JUDGE: Thank you. JUDGE: Take him. Okay? Thank you for saving Benny. I didn't save him. Your son did. All right. L.m s 0")' [WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] Did they find my dad yet? [KNOCK ON DOOR] LOGAN: How's Ben doing? - Does he know? - No. Poor Keith. I wish I could have done something more. You did a wonderful thing. You and Keith did a wonderful thing. I'll go get Beth. Thank you. I came back because I found this in the book that Ben gave me. That's your brother, Drake, isn't it? Yeah. I know what happened lo him. I was there. What do you mean that you were there? Our platoons crossed paths during the night raid. We were ambushed. There was this sergeant that they called "Aces." One of his men got hit. He didn't think about himself for one second. He just took care of his man. And then I found your picture the next morning in the rubble outside. He must have lost it on the way in. I know I've made it hard for you to believe the truth. And I'm sorry for a lot of things, but nothing more than that. I just wanted you to know... ...he didn't die for nothing. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [DOGS BARKING] BETH: Logan, wait. Don't go. [BETH CRIES] You belong here. With us. LOGAN: Everyone has their own destiny. Not everyone makes the choice to follow it. And I'm lucky I did. LOGAN: Birthday boy, you old enough to steer? BEN: Yeah, I am 9, you know. LOGAN: Aye, aye, captain. Take it easy. - Little more left. - That way. That way. [BETH LAUGHS] [English - US - SDH]
