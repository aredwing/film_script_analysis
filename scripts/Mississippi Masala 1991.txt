Hey, it's all right. lt's okay, it's okay. You were just dreaming. You all right? Yeah. Hey. lt's so good to wake up next to you. Anil, come here. What? - What? - Didn't l tell you yesterday? l saw the carpet cleaning kallu with Mina. - That's his van. - No, it is not. - What are you trying to say? - We came here to have fun. - He is insulting my family honor here. - No. - Bastard. - Anil! Hold on. All right. One minute, one minute. - Yeah. - Mina? Who do you think you're fooling with over here? l'm warning you. You Listen, you leave our women alone. - Oh, God, my nose! Napkin! - Go get some help. Get police! Help! Help! Help, please! Help! Oh, help, help. Someone, please. Here. Come, come, come, come. Come, please. - No! - Demetrius, stop! What the hell's going on in here? - That man is trying to kill us. - What? What right do you have to arrest a man? - Shut up or l'll book you for whoring. - You motherfucking asshole! Let's go. Not now. We'll talk later. What is wrong with you, man? Bringing her down to Biloxi. You lost your mind or something? You better leave them fucking foreigners alone, boy. They ain't nothing but trouble. United we stand, divided we fall. Ain't that a bitch? But if you fall in bed with one of their daughters, your ass gonna swing. And what about me? What about me? l've never asked you for anything, never expected anything. l'm 24 years old and l'm still here! Stuck here! Think l'm happy? l love him. - That's not a crime, is it? - You call this love? When all you've done is bring such shame on our heads. - l didn't do anything! They barged in! - Don't answer back! Have the decency, at least to be sorry! l am sorry about this mess. - But l'm not sorry l'm in Iove with him. - Who is he? What do you know about him? What about his family? This is America, Ma. No one cares. We care. Your father and l. You are our only child. lf we don't care who will? Do you know what she told her mother? Just wait, l'm telling you. l love him. That's not a crime. Yeah. Can you imagine dumping Harry Patel for a black? l'm sending my Namita to India as soon as possible. They get ideas from each other and then it spreads like a disease. - Can l speak to Mina, please? - There's no Mina, she not here. Are y'all having nigger trouble? l guess l better call Bob at the bank. After all, we did help him get his loan. There's nothing l can do. l've already hired someone else. You let down your family, your community, your entire race! l don't see no shortage of black women around Greenwood. The chamber of commerce needs responsible people and you're not exactly appropriate. What's wrong with you, boy? Don't you know the rules? Daddy, l didn't do nothing wrong. Mr. Morgan helped you get that Ioan to start up this business. Now, how am l gonna show my face around them after this? Oh, your Mr. Morgan. He didn't give his own money. All he done was to recommend Demetrius to the bank. You and the rest of them want him to know his place and stay in it. But the days of slavery, they over, Williben. - Yeah, boy. - Hush. - Where you going? - To the barbershop. - Well, l ain't through with you yet! - l'm meeting the bank manager. l know you don't want me to go down there with a nappy head, do you? l'm with you, brother. You should leave. No use trying to make a living in this dump. When l need your advice, l'll ask for it. Hey, don't talk to me like that. l'm on your side. You know what they say to me? They say: Your brother deserves what happened. He think he large now. Your brother thought he got himself a white chick. But they just a bunch of insane to the brains. What do they know? Go on home, now. Money is the root of all evil. You give me the root, l'll take the evil. - Demetrius, you're next. - What's happening? - Hey, you got it. - No, you got it. Lisa Bonet, enter my world! l hear what happened. You know, we're just as bad as everybody else. Black folk don't like to see other black folk do good. l tell them you work hard to get where you are. They don't wanna hear that. They just sit back on their butts and wait to see if you fall on your face. And if you do, they just as happy. Hey, D-Money, can you come by and clean my carpets tomorrow? Character, credit collateral, capital and Yes, sir, but business is a little slow right now but we've been regular with our payments two years now. May l finish? lt appears that, for whatever reason, you've lost most of your local clients. We need full repayment of your dues by the first of next month. Failing that, we're gonna have to repossess your van. Boys, let me tell you something. ln my life, l've worked hard for what l've got. l wanna see you work hard for what you get too. Character, capital, collateral. Color. That's the one they left out. - l give up. l'm going back to L.A. - What? That's right. l ain't staying down here no more, man. So you gonna run away too? Just like Alicia. lt ain't worth it, D-Money. l don't need this shit. l waited a long time to be famous. lf that don't work, l'll drive transit buses in L.A. Till the time's right. Room? l'd like to see Mina, please. Wait. One minute. Hello, Jammubhai. Come to the desk. lt's urgent. Okay. Wait. - You want to see me? - No, l asked to speak to Mina. Come with me. You've caused enough trouble. - Sir? - What do you want from us now? l'm Mina's father. l'm Demetrius Williams. Glad to meet you. l know who you are. - Then you know l'm here to see Mina. - That will not be possible. All right. Then l'm glad to have the opportunity to talk with you, sir. l'm sorry. We have nothing to discuss. l believe we do, being that you about ruined my reputation and business. l think l'm entitled to an answer, don't you? l see. You think l ain't good enough for your daughter? No, that's not it. Mina is free to love anyone, to live as she chooses. l respect her freedom. But that does not absolve me of my responsibility as her father. No disrespect to you, sir, but she's a grown woman. And we care for each other. Now, l think that's all there is to it. You know, once l was like both of you. l thought l could change the world, be different. But the world is not so quick to change. Mina is my only child. l don't want her to go through the same struggle as l did. l'm a black man born and raised in Mississippi. Ain't a damn thing you can tell me about struggle. - What do you know about my? - No, l know. l know you and your folks can come here from God knows where and be as black as the ace of spades, but you start acting white and treating us like your doormats. l know that you and your daughter ain't but a few shades from this here. That l know. - To our last night in Uganda. - In Uganda. - To Uganda. Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. To Uganda, you have been so good to us until this madman came. Yeah, we created the madman. We buggers in Uganda. Most people are born with five senses. We are left with only one. A sense of property. - But you see - If l release him, they'll get my neck. l'm trying to tell you He gave an interview, this brother of yours on BBC for the world to hear. - Well - That Amin was evil. You. Out. You can go. Come on, let's go. lt's easy to be king of Kampala. Big fish in a little pond. Why don't you try to be king of London? Or king of Bombay. Because l was born here! l've always been Ugandan first, Indian second. l've been called a bootlicker and a traitor by my fellow Indians. Okelo Uganda is my home. Not anymore, Jay. Africa is for Africans. Black Africans. Do you know why we left Uganda? Do you? They put you in jail. After 34 years, my brother Okelo told me: Africa is for Africans. Black Africans. After 34 years, that's what it all came down to. The color of my skin. That's why we left. Not because of Idi Amin or anything like that. Mina. Believe me. l'm speaking from experience. People stick to their own kind. You are forced to accept that when you grow older. l'm only trying to spare you the pain. Okelo risked his life to save yours. l don't know what more proof you could have of his love. What do you remember? You were just a child. l remember. l remember his face when he came to say goodbye and you wouldn't even look at him. My suggestion is you settle out of court. Save you a lot of time Why should we, Mr. Turnbull? How can you expect any jury to believe your client's in bed with a back injury? Don't think we're ignorant Indians who'll get scared and pay. l'm a lawyer myself! No court on earth will entertain for one minute this fraudulent claim! Why don't you just try me? Don't get scared, Anil. Pure bluff. He was just trying to extort money. Bloody crooks. l'll fix them. Jammubhai, l don't want you to fix anything. You and your family have completely ruined me. You've brought me nothing but trouble. Jammubhai, my peace of mind is gone. Now, l wish that you would also go. Yes. Maybe my shanti will return then. Do you know what your friend's done? He's just sued Anil for 50,OOO. Pack your things. We're leaving Mississippi. Going back to Uganda? What is it going to solve? lt will get Mina away from this fellow. Number two, we are not wanted here. And number three, next week is my court hearing. What court hearing? l'm going to fight it, Kinnu. l'm going to win it. l'm going to get our property back. Kinnu, we can start a new life. How can you even think of it, Jay? How can you even think of going back to Uganda? Kinnu. We are getting old. l don't want to die in some stranger's country. - l'm ashamed of you and your behavior. - How come you always take their side? What about me? l've worked hard to buy this motel. - And l'm not running a charity! - Anil, you have become American. So what? l live here in America. If you don't like it, go back to India. Jammubhai. Please, forgive us for all this. And please, even now if you'll change your mind about going l forgot my shoes in the other room. l feel so bad. How many times must l tell you? l was thinking of going anyway. This was just what we needed. Well? Sir, do you know where l can find Demetrius? Young lady, you've caused enough trouble in my son's life. Don't cause problems in mine by coming in here like this. l'm sorry. l am sorry for everything. l didn't come to make trouble. l just wanna say goodbye to him. We're moving back to Africa. - Williben, they need you in the kitchen. - Yes, ma'am. Sir, please. He's talking to motels in Indianola. Yes, ma'am. Yes Ma'am, we have the latest equipment, the best prices, the best service Wonderful smiles. Why don't you take my card? lt won't hurt you. It's just a piece of paper. - Oh, all right, l give up. - Thank you. Demetrius! What do you want? Huh? What you chasing me for? Your people done put me out of work. What more do you want? You walk into my life from these fancy places. l'm just a carpet cleaner. l've never Ieft Mississippi, but l was happy. l was happy the way l was till you come along after me and God knows why. All those years of building up my business are gone. Now l'm just the biggest joke in Greenwood. Thank you. You listen to me! l never went after you. You chased me. You asked me to your house, you invited me to Biloxi You never told me your family had trouble with black folks. Well, you never asked. You never once asked me about myself. You know why? Because you were too busy using me to make Alicia jealous. Who told you that? Nobody had to. l'm not stupid, you know. Anyway, your nightmare's over. l just came to say goodbye. - l'm moving back to Africa. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. All right, l admit at first l Well, she was with that guy and l l never thought l would fall in love with you. What are you gonna do now? Well, Tyrone went to Los Angeles. Thinking about going somewhere, l guess. Demetrius, can l come with you? - What? - Can l come with you? - Come with me where? - l don't know. Wherever you're going. l didn't say l was going anywhere. l said l was thinking about it. Well, think about it. You said we're gonna travel and see the world and - What we gonna live on, fresh air? - No, you've got the van. l could be your partner. l know how to clean rooms. You're out of your mind. l'm not out of my mind. It's crazy to stay here. For one thing, the van belongs to the bank in two weeks. - If we cross state lines, the federal - That's two weeks away. - That Indian girl, is she with you? - Yes, sir. What you plan to do? - l've been thinking about moving on. - Son. l know something's been keeping you from being happy. And you know l'm gonna miss you. - You gonna be all right? - What do you think l am, a baby? What about Dexter? - Maybe he needs you gone to grow up. - Yeah. About the van l know it'll cause you trouble with Mrs. Morgan, but l'm taking it. You let me worry about that. - Williben. - l have to go. Stay in touch. l love you. God bless you, son. Monte Cristo. May l help you? - Who's that? Anil? - Where's my car? -lf you stop screaming, l'll tell you. - Where's my car, Mina? lf you're with that carpet fellow, ask him, is he going to sue me or what? The car's at the One Stop Hotel. l'll leave the keys with the owner. Please tell him l'm sorry and please ask him to forget the lawsuit. - l will. Don't worry, okay? - Hey, thanks, Mina. Thanks. - Listen, you keep smiling, okay? - l will. ls that Mina? Ask Jay to take it in the room, please. Mina? Ma. l'm not coming back. l'm sorry, but l can't go to Uganda. What would l do there? Are you alone? No. l'm with Demetrius. Jay, are you there? Ma, l'm sorry, l l'm really sorry. Why did he put the phone down? l'll talk to your father. Just come back home now. Demetrius and l are gonna work together. We're leaving Mississippi to see what we can do. We'll talk about this. But come back home now. l can't. lf l don't leave now, l'll never leave. You know that. Then promise me something. Ring Jammubhai every two days and tell him where you are. l will. Ma, l'll see you soon, okay? Kiss Papa for me. You all right? We've always said goodbye to other people. She has a mind of her own. She can't grow here anymore. Mina is your daughter. She's just like you. Fine. Then l also won't go. - You must go. - You're telling me that? You think of Uganda all the time, l know. Go see for yourself what it's like. l'm with you. Everything is in ruins, but it's still heaven. The good soil of Uganda, it is the same. Welcome back, bwana. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. l'm looking for Okelo. Okelo Omorro. He used to teach here. Okelo? Okelo died. Many years ago, in Amin's time. Around '72, l remember. Because of all the troubles, the Asian teachers didn't come to school. And, Okelo, one day he didn't turn up. How did he die? Disappeared one day. They found his body. Were you his friend? l'm sorry. l wrote him so many letters. There is so little love in the world. And yet so much. Mina was right. l never said goodbye to him. Now he's dead, Kinnu. Since l've been back, l've thought so much of you. Which is why l say to hell with the lawsuit. Home is where the heart is. And my heart is with you.
