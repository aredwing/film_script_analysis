Good morning, James Brown. We had a payout too, once upon a time. Has your uncle ever changed his clothes? Never. Not since I can remember. A present from the American embassy. America dropped bombs here, didn't they? Quick, come here, Ahlo. Come here. - Ahlo! - Uncle Purple! Ahlo, come back! These people are in grief. Uncle Purple! Damn endless ceremonies. Reminding you what you'd rather forget. Hey, fish! Sleeping Tiger. Enough explosives to send you to the moon. Tick... tick... Boom! Sleeping Tiger sleeps no more. Were you a soldier? Did you kill Americans? Good time with my uncle? Eat that if you want to keep up with me. Got something for you... This mango is from a 400 year old tree. If you plant it, it will make thousands of mangoes. Got something to show you. Today I found land for Mom's mangoes. Ahlo. I don't want you seeing that man and girl anymore. They're outsiders. They'll make our family look bad. Ah! The little soldier. Entrez. Can't see you and Kia anymore. Oh... Your father thinks I'm a bum? Unconventional. Correct! Bing! That's me - unconventional. You any good at catching rats? I'm good at cooking Rat Pad Thai. Sound good? Stick around. Wort get a peep out of that. No fairy-lights in this abode. Our house has no electricity. So who are the people with lights? Uhh, the Hydro bosses. Selling electricity to all bloody Asia... with nothing left for us. We're the little people. I'm not... I'm not cursed. What idiot killed the lights? - Where's my power? - What's that racket? Finally! Somebody's going to pay for this! Get him! Sorry! Sorry, Aunty! Goat testicle wine is not for wasting. That purple scum put you up to this? One more stunt like that and you're history. The last one in the forest. Good start for the day. Did you steal them from the shrines? These flowers... are for a burial ceremony. - It's part of our tradition... - In my tribe... there's a tradition. I'm a twin. What's he doing? He's stealing food! That's sacred! What's he up to? Put it out! It's too far gone! - This is where he lives! - Burn it all, serve them right! He's their kid! Toma! Don't give them the satisfaction! These lowland rabble! You see, big mama? Karma! Your kid is bad! Here! Burn it all! Let's burn it! Make them pay! As of today, I'm the second most hated person in this village. But first prize is yours. Come here, little soldier. What's wrong with this place, they're all crazy. My hometown was paradise. Food, water, lots of land. Nothing like this... squabbling. Doctor Whiskey, our true friend. Father. Maybe we should all move in here. Those outlaw bastards. They're accusing me... of using your son to steal electricity for my home. They want someone to hurt as much as they do. Your son is the pertect scapegoat. Pardon the expression. Here. They'll search every vehicle that leaves the village. Every vehicle... except one. This is the last time. No more live bombs. Boom! Not a good place to be with a bad luck twin like me. Where do we plant them now? The mangoes... here? Ahlo? They won't last forever. Uncle Purple's old home. Paradise. Fertile soil. Can grow anything. Mangoes too, Dad. At Uncle's old home. Paradise sounds good. Here's your road. We go straight on. What's there? Chomsavan town. Big rocket competition. We're going to compete. - Rocket festival? - No! Not on a bomb can't to some rocket festival. We'll go to Purple's village. Plant the mangoes. C'mon... give me money. C'mon. Let's go. Lucky bastard goat! Even you get a ride. Mother, you don't have to do this. I'm 68 years old, Toma. I want a home. Looks like our home village. Hurry up! Where is everyone? People around here passed through, don't worry. Our village welcomes everyone. There. But where is everyone? Moved on, you know. Pick a house. Have two if you like! So much land. Soon it'll rain, Dad. Then plant Mom's mangoes. Go, go, you two! Find me something to eat. - I'll have this one! - I'll have that one! That one's like my old home! This one! Ahlo, where are you? What gifts do you bring? Place them there. Poo... Something smells rotten. Come on! Show me what you got! Smash it to pieces! Come on, give me all you got! Can't lose. Come on! Bigger one! Give me a big one! Come, come on! Uncle, we're just playing! Why'd you stop us? - Let go of Kia! - It hurts, let go! - Come here! - Let go of Kia! Down! Get off! - What just happened? Huh? - Oh... The bombie. See... looks edible, doesn't it? But inside... crammed with hundreds of bullets. Then... Boom! So, picked a house yet? Which one you like? This place stinks of death. Tomorrow... we go to Chomsavan. Ahlo! From one soldier... to another. For you. Wake up, Uncle, wake up. Go away... That bomb crater suits him. Come on, leave him there. Drunken fool. I can't. I promised my father... I would look after my uncle. I can't leave him. Two days to go, ladies and gentlemenl Biggest rocket competition yet. Big cash prizes for the winner. Yes, it's the Rocket Competitionl Ahlo! Come quick. Big cash prizes, ladies and gentlemenl - Hello. - Hello. I'm very sorry. Many people want to live here, but no one is allowed. You better leave.

We fire rockets to the sky, to ask for rain... Bat shit... If you make explosives from it... BOOM! Shit-hot explosives... from bat shit. No matter what, you can't live here. - Two days, then leave. - Crazy man. I want to build a rocket. If we win, we can buy some land. Here, go buy a big bag of rice. Go, go. - I want to build a rocket! - You're such a boy! - I want to build a rocket! - You're such a boy! Is it hard? Not really. Lots of explosives though. The body, the tail. - And then? - The fuse. Ready? He was making a huge rocket, that young monk. What's he doing with the hair? Why are the sky gods so angry? No rain for so long now. Ah, excellent clipping! Check this out. Oh yes, that's great, very good. Now stick it on, nice and hairy, like this. Then point it up like this, and just shoot! Right up into the gods' ass! Ahlo, your rocket better be big. Dick committee. I'll eat you before you get my rice! That's it? Where's the change? I want to build a rocket. Looks delicious. Careful! Explosives. You want to blow our heads off? I want to build a rocket. If we win, we'll get big cash prizes, Dad. We can buy land, a house. Even somewhere for mangoes. No! Forget the mangoes, they're going rotten. Tomorrow... we go on to the city. Many factories there. Jobs for all of us. No, a rocket, Dad! Big bunch of money, Dad. Better than a factory. Please Dad, let me build it. No way, you'll kill us all! Toma. If you can build a bong, you can build a rocket. You must build the rocket. Dad, tell Grandma I can help. - Dad you chicken shit! - You... You desecrate people's shrines! You nearly got us killed by those bombies. And your mother... Your mother... you... You're no help at all! I'll build my own! I hate you! I'll build my own rocket! Too green, too heavy... Too crooked, not straight. All useless! How about this one? It's all right to cry.

Sleeping Tiger. You fought for the Americans. How do I make explosives from bat shit? Take two buckets of bat splat. Some sulfur and charcoal, mix it up. After that, your bamboo pole will be flying to the moon. So what you say? Wanna break that curse bad, hey? Come on, take me to the bat cave, already. Pay attention, little dick. For a rocket to win... it must be spectacular! The most important bit... salt! Sodium makes it yellow, see. This was for your Papa and Nanna dear... Here. Copper. Mix in copper filings.
