Apparently, Perez has the AIDS virus and believes this is a miracle. He has refused to get out of his car. And as you can see, the faithful have arrived from all across the state, each and every one- - Hi. - Hey. Hey, how's it feel to be my husband? Today I must say that I'm the happiest man in the world. Someone shut that dog up! Shit. Excuse me. I'm so sorry. Can I use your cell phone? It's an emergency. - Yeah. - Oh, thank you so much. Just... you're so kind. Just one minute, one minute. Oh, thank God you're still there. How's he doing? Can I speak with him, please? Hi. Hi, honey, it's Mommy. How you doing, sweet pea? How you doing? I miss you. I miss you so much. I'm on this date, and it's going so well. It's going really, really well. His name is David, and he really likes me. I think he really likes me, and he even wants to take me to Paris. I think I got it right. I think I got it right this time. David. Yes? I really didn't mean to knock that table over back there. I... I just... I don't know what happened. I just... I'm so... I'm so nervous, because I really like you, and I know this is our first date and everything, and I know that it's probably not the way that you wanted it to turn out, but I can be better. I really, really want to see you again, and I really want to prove to you that I can be- I can be better than this. Do you remember Annie Hall, the movie? I was just thinking about the first date thing when, you know, Alvy and Annie, they talk about the first kiss during their date, and they just sort of get it out of the way. It just feels like that moment. Listen, Johnny. Hey, do you want to come in for a minute? Good night, Johnny. Rudy? Where are you? Rudy? Rudy? I found a new place to dwell Well, it's down at the end of the lonely street to Heartbreak Hotel I've been so lonely, baby You make me so lonely I get so lonely, I could die Hey, where's my dog? Can you not see that I'm busy? Come on, man, just have you seen him? No dogs allowed. Read sign. Look, where the hell is my dog? He took off, ran away. He was barking, barking, barking like crazy, and I go to the door, he took off, ran away. Not my fault. Your- I already told you too many times. No dogs allowed! It just holds no value to me. Christ. What does that mean, an act of faith? What? Oh, Christ. Oh, shit, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What were you doing in the street, huh? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come on. Come on. Do you feel a deep sense of loneliness? Wish that you had someone special to share your dreams with? Do you ever wonder if there is that special person waiting out there just for you? You, sir, are a lucky dog. You hear me? You're a lucky, lucky dog. That's what I'll call you. I'll call you Lucky. Welcome to your new home, Lucky. Welcome back. I'm just passing through. I don't have a lot of time to waste. I had no choice. After you went down, the feds were watching me like a hawk. I couldn't go down like that. - Had a family to take care of. - What about me? I didn't have a family? You don't call. You don't write. You don't do shit. We're friends? I swear, I would kill you if given a chance. Remember that job in Carson? You were young and stupid. Now you've repaid that debt with your silence. This is who we are. This is the path we chose. I've come to accept it. How was she? My Mary? Did you see much of her? Beginning, yes. Not much again till the end. My name ever come up? No. But I don't think she ever stopped loving you. It's what's owed to you... and everything you need to know. I hope the next time we find each other is in heaven. Girl, what you doing? Whatever. Get off my corner, whore. Bitch, get to work. Look, honey, this is probably your first time, so I'm going to spell out the menu for you, okay? $20, I jerk you off. $100, you can fuck me in the ass. A few dollars more, you can come on my face. I don't care about my mascara running, just don't get it in my hair, okay? That's all you charge? Seriously, I think you're worth much more than that. You look like a beautiful woman. That's very sweet of you, honey, but for now I've got tits and 8 inches fully functional. But one day, I dream to be flawless. What does that mean? To be tucked, operated on, you know? Why haven't you done that? - It's mucho dinero, seor. - Oh. I'm saving up. How much do you make a night? What's it to you? Nothing, I just- what is it, like, $400, $500- Stop the fucking car. You're wasting my time. Stop the car. Gracias. Hold on, stay, stay. I need you to help me save someone. Okay? I'll pay you. And I assure you that if you do this, you- you'll probably never have to do what you do ever again. I don't do anything I don't want to do, okay? So what do you want from me? In the back of my car, there's a backpack. I want you to open it. I want you to look inside. Inside, there's $50,000 cash. It's all the savings I have left in the world, and I want you to have it if you just do me this one service. There's a gun in my glove compartment. And it's got 2 bullets in the chamber. I want you to pick up that gun. I want you to hold it really tight, and I want you to shoot me right here in my heart. This is a fucking joke, right? Am I on TV or something? I've seen this shit on TV. There's little spy cameras everywhere. I know this. I know, I know, Slim. He put you up to this, didn't he? It's not a joke. It's not a joke. There can't be any accidents. There's a suicide note with my signature. So when they find me, you don't have to worry about the authorities, okay? Why did you do that? Do what? Your goddamn prayer. Are you religious? Get out of my car. Do you not want to burn in hell? Is that what it is? Get out. You fucking coward. So you search the streets for people like me because we seem desperate? - I said get out. - You fucking coward. Get out of my car! - So who cares, right? - Get out! - You go! - Lay off of it! Everyone's got problems! - Deal with it! - Go! Mtate, pinche puto. I'm sorry. You're all right. Everything's gonna be all right. Just picture yourself in the arms of such a goddess. Welcome to my world, to the excruciatingly erotic world of Wild Velvet. We bring you all the ladies that Victoria... Has been keeping a big, big secret. And now the Wild Velvet is proud to present the luscious, the lascivious, the one, the only Scarlet. - Love you, Scarlet! - Whoo! Emotionless this city lies Cruel it is, it clouds my eyes The dark, the dark shades on my day I live inside this place Locked up inside my metal cage Always tense and filled with rage Above the concrete fields below With you I want to go, want to go Music is my sanctuary Music is my blanket I see only what I want to see I'll be only what I want to be Yeah My blanket covers me Yeah Check it Now, as a youth, man, I was body poppin' breakin' on the lino Traded in my lino for a pad and a biro Used to stand in line so as I can sign my giro But now my ends are meeting in the best way that I know And the beats that go boom See the music I consume to escape the doom and gloom All the beats and melodies that keep realities at bay But what happen when the record's done and start to fade away, fade away Alone within myself again I try to veil away my pain The dirty grey surrounding me 'round And now I hear no sounds Doctor, what is it? Jack, you have gastric cancer. How much time do I have? It depends on your will to live. Yo, excuse me. Calm down, man. This is my last stop. And your nose is bleeding. Okay, well, after carefully reviewing your application, Mr. Doolittle, I regret to inform you that we have denied your request for a loan at this time. But I filled everything out just like you requested. Yes. When your father passed away, he left a lot of debt. I'm afraid, without a substantial payment, we have no choice but to begin foreclosure proceedings at the end of the month. Hello, Mrs. Wilson? Hey, this-this is Qwerty from the mortuary. Why are you calling? No, I-I was wondering- I know I promised no payments till after New Year, but I was just wondering if- if there was anything you can offer in the next few days, that would-that would be hugely appreciated. Richard got laid off. It's Christmas, and I haven't gotten the children anything yet. I don't think- All right, no, you know what? Forget the call. Forget the call. You keep the money, and you buy your kids some gifts. You make it a good Christmas for 'em. Thank you, Qwerty. Your father would be proud. All right, no. You're a fine young man. Yep, you have a good night, Mrs. Wilson. All right. Oh, Christ, I'm sorry. You-you scared me. I was driving by, I saw the lights in here, so I thought it was open. No, we're actually closed. We open at 10:00 in the morning. Okay. I need a coffin. I need it tonight. And I'll pay you cash for it. It's kind of- it's peaceful in there, huh? What do you think? Sorry. I'll take it. All right, sir. It's a-it's a great choice. You won't be disappointed. I have another request. Oh, we can customize it with anything you want. In the past, we even put a complete sound system with speakers in. No, no, this-this is- No, no, I like the coffin. It's just that it needs a body. Oh, we're a full service mortuary, sir. Has-has the deceased been embalmed yet? No, he's-he's not dead yet. I'm sorry, I don't understand. Sir, please- Please, I don't want any trouble. I know this is an unusual request, but I need you to take this gun and put a bullet inside my heart. No, perhaps you've been drinking. Please, everything is- everything's gonna be all right. - I can pay you. - No. I got $50,000 cash. What, you don't believe me? I'll show you. I'll show you; it's in my car. This can't be happening. It could all be yours. I know you have problems. I heard you on the phone. We all have problems. You help-you help me with mine, I help you with yours. No, keep it. Please, please. Please, sir. Sir, in my-in my profession, I see death every day, some by accident, some by sickness, but some through despair. These are the ones I wish I could have helped. Help me. Help me by pulling this trigger. Please. Come on, please. Please, I need your help. - No. - Please. - Go ahead. - I won't do it. I won't kill you. No. Why? It's easy! I and my father are one? But can you feel my pain? Can you feel my pain? Hi. Hey. Hey. How's it feel to be my husband? Today, I must say that I'm the happiest man in the world. Let me show you. Let me show the kids. Hey. I love you. I love you too. Charlie? Sorry to wake you, but we're - we're closing down soon. Here. It's on the house. Just hope it might cheer you up. You have a few minutes, so... or I could pack it up to go for you. You want to share it? Share it with me? Oh. It's tempting, but I have this new dress for the holiday that I'm determined to fit in. Want to know my secret? I hang it over the dining table to help motivate me a bit. It's good, huh? Isn't it? We bake 'em fresh here every morning. I think they're good. I don't mean to be nosy or anything, but what's a man like you doing at this hour passed out in a diner? I had a really hard day. Big smile like yours, you expect me to believe that? Yeah, just right here. Okay. Yeah, just right up there. I like the lights. I did it myself. Yeah? I like the different colors. Yeah. Yeah, I've always loved Christmas. You live there a long time? About a year, since my divorce. You don't really have to talk about that if you don't feel like it. I don't- Well, we- you know, we grew apart. You know, you wake up one morning after 13 years, and the feeling's gone, and, you know, you try to hang in there, but there's really nothing you can do. But we both agreed that, you know, we didn't want to grow old taking up each other's space. You guys still talk, then? Not for a couple months. Do you- do you want to come up, 'cause I'm just- I live there alone, and I don't have any cats, in case your allergic. I, um... I don't... I don't think I should do that. No, you're probably right. It's late. I mean, you're probably really tired anyway. Can I ask you something? How come you picked me up, gave me a ride? I don't know. I don't-I don't know why. I don't know. Okay, I hope you don't mind. I just haven't- I just, you know, haven't kissed a man in a long time. I just forgot how good it feels. Okay, thank you for the ride. Maybe I'll see you around. Okay. - Yeah! - Whoo! Hey, you're late again. Get down there and get dressed and get on the fucking stage now. We need to talk now. Well, lookie, lookie, Cookie. No, don't stop. It just got a lot more interesting. So come on and join the party, sweetcakes. We are on lesson number 3, the day you were absent. Oh, no, you did not touch the 'do. Oh, yeah. Fuck your 'do, and fuck your whores. Who you calling a whore, you little bitch? I don't see what else- No, no, no, Cookie, Cookie, Cookie. Go upstairs. We'll finish up later. All right. So... What are we talking about here, Johnny? I don't understand. Tell me- We're talking about my son. We're talking about my son. I cannot work on Christmas Eve. I have to be with him. Your son needs you to work, and he needs you to work very hard. Don't you fucking tell me what's best for my kid. I swear to God. The kid would not know the difference whether you're there or not. Goddamn it. Johnny, I have been easy on you, because when I watch you dance, I get a raging boner, and so do a lot of other people. But on Christmas Eve, I'm gonna have a lot of very lonely people out in my club, some even thinking about killing themselves, and they come here looking for companionship. They're looking for a little bit of love. They are looking for a little bit of hope. What about... what about one of the girls who's Jewish? What about them? Why can't they work? That is not the point. All the dancing that goes on on that stage is nothing but an expensive advertisement for the main attraction in the fucking blue room. Well, I am not a whore. Well, then you better learn, Johnny, 'cause you are costing me $1,000 a head every time you don't give any. Let me put it this way. If you are not here on Christmas Eve, you should consider getting a job at Wally's Whack Shack. We clear? Yeah. You all right? Everything all right? Just leave me alone. It's getting colder. You're gonna get sick dressed like that. Why don't you just fuck off? Listen, I'm not gonna go back in until I know you're all right. You don't have to rush. Just take your time. Do you have a smoke? Yeah, sure. You're not from around here, are you? No, I'm just passing through. Yeah, I thought so. You're too nice. Thanks. Where are you from? San Francisco. Moved down here about a year ago. What's your name? Scarlet. Scarlet. I'm Jack. Were you in here the other night? No. You sure? 'Cause I don't forget eyes like yours. I'm sure. Get dressed. You got a request for a private. Whoa. I got to go. Can I see you again? Yeah, yeah. Just request me, Scarlet. Wait for me in the blue room. Here. - Oh. - Thanks. Okay. Hey, papa. I hope I didn't keep you too long. I'll make it up to you. First one's on me. This is your first time, isn't it? Yeah, let's- why don't we just talk first? Most men don't pay me to talk. And the ones who do are trying to talk me into something else. But I'm telling you, I don't do anything but dance. I don't want anything. Let's just talk like we were doing before. Come dance with me. Here? No. No, I-I'm not good at that. Yes, it will be fun. I got old legs. They might be old, but they're not dead. And it's a slow song. Just stop. Are you afraid of me? I'm old enough to be your father. Most of them are. No, stop. Oh, sweet pea, Mommy misses you so much. I just don't know how much longer I can do this. I'm trying for you, baby. I miss you so much. I just feel like it's my fault. Arctic storms moving into Northern California should cause temperatures in the L.A. basin to drop as much as 25 degrees. Although temperatures have been within normal ranges for this holiday season, these temps are highly unusual. Come on, Lucky. Come on. Come on. Come on, Lucky. Excuse me, miss, may I check your purse? No, you may not. I'm not asking for your permission. Are you accusing me of something? Say, sweetie, there you are. I was looking for you. - Is everything okay? - Store security. I need to check her purse. Oh, you know what? This is my fault. It's a collector's edition, and I told her that I paid for it already, but I got sidetracked. Can-can we just let this slide? Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Get your hands off me! All right. Here. Must be for someone special, huh? Why are you following me? I just - let me buy you some lunch, okay? Your choice. I just want to talk. There you go. Well, you're just filled with little tricks, aren't you? Here's your dessert. - Thanks. - Enjoy. So what brings you to this city? Well, what brings anyone to this city? I wanted to be a somebody. Is that so much to ask? You sound like a nonbeliever. No, this city just has a way of crushing your dreams pretty fast. Well, what about your parents. Were they for it? My mother just recently passed away, and my father died in a boating accident before I was born. That's what she told me, anyway. You have doubts? I don't know. I used to catch her staring off into somewhere for hours, like she knows that he's still around. Can I tell you a secret? Yeah, sure. I see my father all the time. How? In my sleep, especially when I was younger. See, he likes to travel the world, and if I'm good, then sometimes he'll take me with him and share his adventures with me. And what's he like? He's handsome, and he has strong hands and a very gentle heart. I mean, he couldn't hurt a fly if he wanted to. And he has eyes like yours, all mysterious and full of secrets. I'm sorry, I don't mean to make you feel uncomfortable. It's okay. Don't apologize. I just really like talking to you. I really like talking to you too. You know what time it is? I don't have a watch- I got to go. I'm late for work. I can't afford to lose another job. You'll come in and see me? Yeah. All right. Thanks. Don't stop believing. Only in miracles, Jack. - Hi. - Hey. I'm Nicole. Hey. I'm-my name's Qwerty. I know. It's on your name tag. Is this your first time? Yeah. Is it that obvious? It's also my first time. You know, at first, I didn't really want to come. I didn't want to seem desperate, like I need help in meeting someone. But then I realized I haven't been on a date in-in 2 years. So, here I am. Are-are you coming inside? Yeah, of course, of course. Is everything all right? I'm sorry; I think I'm losing circulation. Where? Just here in my right leg. Can I get you some water or something? Are you- Help! Hi. Hey. I haven't seen you around in a few days. I was such an idiot the other night. I don't know what came over me, but I apologize if I was being too forward. It's been a very long time for me too. You finished? You're off? Yeah, it's been slow. If-if you want some company, I could- If you-if you'd like, I could take you home. I mean, if you want, I could- Yeah, no, I- yeah, I would like that. I would. Great. But not tonight. I can't. That's him. He called, you know, right - shortly after I got home. And he wants to talk, and so here he is. All right, well, bye. Mm, bye. Some friends of yours, they told me that you could help me. I'm looking for a girl. I don't know her name. I met her the other night. She-she has really big blonde hair. She was wearing a red dress with-with these all on it. I could-I could pay you for your time if you help me find her. Well, I ain't seen her all night, but if they found her dead, I wouldn't be surprised. What do you mean by that? That seorita tried to execute her life twice, man. She slit both her wrists. The crazy girl want to make a baby inside of her. It like the ultimate transformation and shit. She even fake a miscarriage, you get me, man? How do you know this? I'm her doctor. She tell me all her symptoms, you know, man. And I prescribe her medication, make her feel good. Listen, man, if she ain't on the streets, I can't tell you. If she ain't dead, she be out here on Friday night or at the Geisha Dungeon. Geisha Dungeon, what's that? The devil's lair. Hey. - Hello. - Hi. I was hoping you would come in. I saw you in my dreams last night. Yeah, I wasn't sure you were gonna be here. Can you come closer? I'd like to get a good look at your face. Okay. It was strange. You were running. You were running from something. Maybe I was trying to run to something or someone. No. You had fear in your eyes like you do now. I, um... I was thinking about what you said yesterday, you know, that stuff with your father taking you to places that you've never been. Well, guess what? What? I got you 2 tickets to anyplace in the world. I don't know what to say. Say, "I accept". No, I can't. We barely even know each other. Listen. I don't have a lot of time left. I don't watch the clock in here, Jack. You can have me for as long as you want. What I'm saying is, I'm going away soon, and I'm not gonna be coming back. I want you to have these tickets. It would mean a lot to me. Who are you? Why are you so good to me? My name's Jack Doheny. I've been locked away for 25 years, which is a hell of a lot of time for a man to reflect on his life, the choices he made and what he wants to do if given a second chance. For 25 years, I waited for my love to come visit me. But that day never came. And then I got the news that she passed away. I never got the chance to - to tell her I was sorry. I loved her more than anything. I'll never forget the day that I first laid eyes upon her. Her smile was beautiful. She was so graceful. When I saw her the next day... I dumped a truckload of roses at her feet... and I told her that if it wasn't enough, I'd come back the next day with roses from all over the world. We had dinner that night, and by morning... she became my wife. No. I don't know what you're trying to tell me or who you are or who put you up to this, but you have some nerve coming in here. You are a sick son of a bitch, and I want you to get out of here now. I want you to leave now. Get the fuck out of here! What are you looking at? Don't look at me. Get out of here. Get the fuck out of here! No, wait, wait, don't! Don't come back. Someone please answer me. Someone please- Somebody please answer me now. I need you. I need you right now. Excuse me. Ma'am, visiting hours are over. Ma'am, you can't go in there. Ma'am. Is he all right? Why wasn't anyone here when I called? Everything is fine. The other nurse waited. You didn't call. Her shift is over now. What is wrong with you people? This is my son. He's dying, don't you understand? This is my son, and he's dying. All right. Just please keep it down. How you doing, sweet pea? Oh, you scared me tonight. Mommy called, and nobody answered, and I thought something happened to you. I thought you had left me. I got something for you. I know you're gonna like it. It's a special edition. Why don't you open your eyes so you can see it? You are gonna be all right. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. I promise you. I promise you, sweet pea. I just miss you so much. Baby? Baby? Baby, are you awake? Nurse! Nurse! Doctor! Sit down for a minute, Johnny. I don't want to sit. I don't want to sit. Please put it out and have a seat. Have some coffee. Johnny, your boy is in what's known- Billy. His name is Billy. Yes, Billy. I need to remind you that for the last 3 months, he's in what's known as a persistent vegetative state. He blinked. I saw it with my own eyes. While I was talking to him, he blinked. That's misleading, and it's a- it's a common involuntary reflex response to motion and sound. Do you believe in miracles? In my profession, sometimes I have no choice but to. Well, maybe this is one of those times. I saw him blink. I saw it with my own eyes. There's not much else I can do. I'm sorry, Johnny. Well, fuck you. You're a doctor... Calm down. And all you can say is, "I'm sorry"? Calm down, Johnny. You're a trained professional. You are supposed to help people, and my son needs help. He needs your help. You're all he's got. Don't you understand that? Is it the money? You don't think I have the money? Well, I will work every day of my life. It's not the money. Then what is it? It's okay. I won't tell anyone. Is this what you want? Is this what you want? I'm sorry, Johnny. Where are you going? Please don't leave. I'll do whatever you want. Come back here! Doctors help people! You are not a doctor! You can't help anybody! You're a fucking shit! Dr. Alexander call extension 2860. Dr. Alexander, 2860. What am I gonna do, Lucky? What am I gonna do with you? I don't think I can take care of you much longer. I got to get you back home. Don't look at me like that. Don't look at me like that. You don't even belong to me. Someone out there is missing you right now. Wild Velvet. Hey, hey, is there a Rose-Johnny there? Johnny who? A Rose-Johnny. You mean Scarlet. Hold on. Rudy! Hi. Oh, God. I missed you so much. Thank you so much for finding him. I don't know how I'll ever repay you. Oh, no, no, no, no. It was-it was my fault. I accidentally hit him with my car. But he's all right now. Okay. Would you like to come in? Can I ask you something? Yeah, please, anything. I don't know how to put this. You know, just forget it. No, no, don't stop. You can-you can ask me anything you want. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Can I use your bathroom? Yeah, of course. It's across the hall. Oh, shit. Um, about the reward money... Oh, no, I don't- I can pay you next week, I promise. No, it's okay. If you have any concerns, I fed him 3 times a day. I walked him 3 times a day. I got him a toy in the back. You think I could just hold your hands for a second? Yeah, sure. You're cold. That's you. And sweaty. Well, it's-it's hot in here. And they're soft. Yours too. You want to try something? I'm gonna count to 3, and we're both gonna stand up, and we're gonna hug each other. Can you do that? Do you mind? Can we do that? It was a stupid idea. Okay, I want to try it. I was hoping you'd say that. Are you ready? Yeah. Okay. That was nice, wasn't it? Yeah. It was nice. It was real nice. Can we do- can we do it again? Okay. Well. I know what you're gonna say, that it's time for you to leave. But I don't - I don't want you to go. I want you to stay. You sure? Yeah. You can stay here. I got-I got plenty of blankets. You can stay the night. I don't even know your name. Oh, it's Qwerty. Qwerty Doolittle. My name's Rose-Johnny. But everybody just calls me Johnny. Well, it's nice to meet you, Rose. Nice to meet you, Qwerty. You have to have a heart that's open to God. Big change in our local weather over the next few days. A low-pressure cold front will be moving in during the next 24 hours as the jet stream heads south into the gulf. These temperatures will be highly unusual. Hello? Rose? Lucky? I got something for you, Rose. Rose? And now let's give a banging welcome to our very sweet but very naughty Scarlet. Merry Christmas, Scarlet. Yeah. Oh, the werewolf the werewolf Comes a stepping along He don't even break the branches where he's gone Once I saw him in the moonlight when the bats were flying I saw the werewolf and the werewolf was cryin' Cryin' nobody nobody nobody knows nobody knows how I loved the man as I teared off his clothes Cryin' nobody, no nobody knows my pain when I see that it's risen that full moon again For the werewolf the werewolf have sympathy For the werewolf Somebody like you and me And only he goes to me Man, this little flute I play All through the night Until the light of day and we are doomed to play For the werewolf For the werewolf Have sympathy For the werewolf Come on! Come back. Where you going? Well, let's hear it for Scarlet. She is just waiting for that big bad wolf. And it might as well be you. Dancers only. I need to talk to Rose. To Scarlet, I need to talk- Which part did you not understand? I need to talk to Rose. I need to talk to Rose, come on! Why'd you leave? You didn't even leave a note. Men usually leave me first. I was just trying to save you the trouble. Well, you're wrong about me. Why did you come today? I came for you. I'm a single mother with a kid in a coma, and I make my living by taking my clothes off. I'm a klutz, and I spill everything. I work with the dead. I play with puppets. I've never had a real girlfriend in my life, and I get nervous around people, which triggers my asthma. Don't do this to me. I'm trying not to. Just promise me one thing. When tomorrow comes, everything's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay. I'm not playing games with you. Fine, I'll get it myself. Give me my money. Tell me how I look. Because I am feeling so glamorous tonight. Give me my money. Give me my money! You're no fun. Go and sit down. Sit down. I want you to... take your wig off. Just do it. Now... I want you to wipe off your makeup. Just wipe it off. I like where this is going. Don't I look beautiful? Tell me I look beautiful. You said you wanted to be flawless. With this- this money, you can make that life- that part of your life- perfect. Give me the gun. What? Give me the gun. You want to die, right? I can help you. I understand what you want. Please. Give me the gun. I want to help you. That night when you asked me to take your life, I didn't understand why. Now I do. I understand everything now. I found that picture in your car. And I couldn't help but think about you, how lonely you must feel inside without love. Do you want love in your life? Yeah. Then open your heart. Hey. What are you doing? You know... I used to love a man once. And I gave him my heart. I gave him my soul. I gave him my love. But that wasn't good enough for him. That piece of shit wanted a real woman. He wanted me to give him something that I could never give him. So he left me. Who's gonna love me, big daddy-o? God! At your service, ma'am. Does it fly? Faster than the speed of sound. Wonderful. I will take a one-way ticket to Paris, please. All right. - Here we go. - Okay. Come on. Whoo! Whoo! Did you get all your Christmas shopping done? Oh, no, I'm gonna be shopping at the gift shop tonight. Well, then, there's that. But the holidays kind of get you down when you see something like this. Yes, they do. Poor kid. Doctor's don't hold much hope for him. I don't even know how she's gonna pay for all this. I mean, come on. She's a stripper, you know? They call it exotic dancer. Get the doctor now. We moved him to the code room. Heart rate was climbing fast. Oxygen saturation well below 90%. This sounds like pulmonary hemorrhage. Call pulmonary and see if they can do a scope. What do we have? Looks like massive PE, and his right ventricle is starting to give out. Tell blood bank we need 3 units now. Sir, you can't be in here. Wait, wait, what's going on? - Sir, are you a relative? - Yeah, he's my grandson. You need to go down to the waiting room. It's down the hall to the left, please. Wait, wait, is he gonna be okay? We're trying everything we can. - Trust us. - Did you contact his mother? We are trying to locate her right now. Please. A doctor will be right with you. Nurse, will you take him to the waiting room? We're doing everything we possibly can. Why are you doing this to me? Why? My only sin is love. We do not quit until his condition stabilizes. - Am I clear? - Yes, doctor. Increase dopamine to 15. Someone pick up the damn phone. ICU. He's in V-tach. They can't find his mother. Taxi, taxi, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hey, stop! Please, I need a ride. It's an emergency. I got to find my daughter. Please wait. Stop, stop! Stop, please, I got to find my daughter. I got to find my daughter. Please, please, it's an emergency. I need to help her. Go to 120. Okay, 3, 2, 1, clear. For I believe. Helped by unbelievers. Go to 240. Rose! Rose, where are you? Rose. Rose! Clear. Again. Clear. I guess it's not coming after all, the rain. I was looking forward to it. Mind if I join you? If you wish. Oh, I'm sorry. Were you expecting someone? No, I just- I just like sitting alone. Most of us have forgotten how pleasurable it can be. What is your name? Diana. Charlie. Nice to meet you, father. No, please. Could you just call me Charlie? Is that how we first met? Exactly. I was even wearing this red coat, remember? How could I forget that? You looked beautiful. Charlie. Yeah? It's not your time yet. I'm not going anywhere. I'll be right here waiting for you. My God, I love you. I never stopped loving you. Father? Father Bishop? Father Bishop, what are you doing here? Are you returning to us? God bless you, sister. God bless you. I didn't call last night because I- I wanted to believe that everything was gonna be all right. I'm so sorry, baby. I love you, sweet pea. Let it go! Hey! There it is. Rose? Thank God I caught you. I need you to sign this. It's the receipt for your hospital bill. Everything's been paid for. I don't know what you're talking about. Well, a gentleman came in last night and paid all the hospital bills. He wanted to remain anonymous. I'm sorry about Billy. He left this for you. So you have any room left for a slice of pie? No, sorry, I'm - I'm full. I have to say, you look really good this morning. Thanks. You might want to know that my ex-husband and I, we tried to talk, but who were we kidding? And I don't know if you have plans tonight, but I've got a brand-new dress and nowhere to go. Are you asking me out? Are you accepting? Yes. Oh, yeah? Good. Here, let me give you my number. Oh, okay. Should we say, like, my place, like 6:00? All right, I'll be waiting. I'll be there. Hey. Hey, I called in last week, and I was looking for the girl with the dog. I was-I was just wondering, is she-is she still there? No, she's gone. No, I don't know, but she's gone, man. No, her and dog leave. Not my fault. No, I'm- No, I am sorry. I saw him laughing. - See you, guys. - Hey, good show. Good show, thank you. Can we get something to eat, dad? Bye, Maggie. See ya. - Bye. - Bye. I have 2 tickets to Paris. Isn't she surprising? Aren't you amazed? Everything you thought you had to be goes up in flames Isn't she enlightening? Try toe be amused Reason doesn't work when you're brand-new If you want to know of what you're made Hey, where you going? The woman is the way Wouldn't try to bite when she calls your name You might not see something that might say it ever again And if you give her one chance, man she's gonna take you right to yourself Yourself Or else Try to make it run but the happy just won't seem to leave you alone Oh, well Oh, well Say you want it all but the hole won't fill unless you fill it with her Oh, well Oh, well So shut your mouth Turn down that brain that's led you astray And you'll never know her, but the woman is the way Always remind me how you almost got by me I don't know what I would have done without you, honey Tell it to her softly Tell her like you should Tell her that no matter what she'll always have your love
