Well, see you all tomorrow. - Yeah, let's give it a ring. Oh yeah, should be all right. - I remember when Mama used to ring that bell 'til our feet hit the front porch. Used to drive Daddy crazy. - He'd be proud. - Yes, he would. This is for him, for the family. - Collins brothers. We got us a business that we can share. The hard work is going to pay off, too. - God's been good to us. I'm just happy to have my baby brother as my business partner. Look, I gotta run. I gotta meet Emma and the kids at the pond, and she don't like me being late for anything. - Well, you better go and get out of here, Bobby. I'll see you and the family tomorrow for the Grand Opening. - You know it. See you then. - I'm hungry, Pops. - Well, you know I think Mama, she made some corn bread and some homemade jam. Y'all ready for a picnic? - Yes. - All right, come on. - This is for you, Miss Emma. - Thank you, sweetheart. All right. - Thanks, Mom! - Let's go. - Michael, wait up. - How's the store looking? - Tomorrow's a big day. We've even got Grandma's dinner bell hanging outside. - That loud thing? I'm sure the customers are really gonna like that. - It ain't that loud. - Yes, it is. That thing sounds like a train coming. - Well, I'll tell you what. We never missed a meal. - Oh yeah, you right about that. - What else you got in there? - Some jam. - There's a biscuit, too. - - Yes, indeed. - Every time I see that tree over there, it reminds me of when I was a little boy. Me and my daddy, we planted this little seed. It grew into something really beautiful. That's how God is with us. He takes our family and He rains down His love. - Daddy? Hey, Pop! Daddy. - He ain't here. We found him this morning... facedown in the creek. Ain't but a foot deep. - Matty, do you know what happens in the woods when all the wolves die out? - No, I don't, Snake. - When they get hunted down... that's when they move in. - What are you even talking about, Snake? - What about the store, Matty? First the store, then what? The whole town? No. I ain't gonna let them... take our town. That store was my daddy's store, your daddy's store. - I know. Why does it have to be anybody's store, Snake? Can't it just... Can't you just let it... Just let it be? - You always was soft. - Okay. We're gonna to scare 'em well. Let's run them out of town for good, Snake, me and you. The Cain brothers. Let's do it, let's do it! Let's do it, yeah! I ain't soft. Snake! - Where are them kids? - They was here somewhere. - - I have no ide... - Check the closet. - Closet. I know they're here somewhere. Mama Bear, did you see those kids? - No! - - Mama Bear! - No! - - A-ha! I see 'em. Where are those kids? I'm gonna eat those kids. - Uh-oh. - I'm gonna get ya. - I'm gonna get ya. I'm gonna get ya. - Oh, babe. Come get into bed. Y'all know you can't hide from Papa Bear. There you go, son. I love you, baby girl. - I love you, too, Daddy. - Michael. Don't I get a goodnight kiss? - Too old, Dad! - Too old? How about an "I love you"? - Too old! - Well, I tell you what. Tomorrow's opening day for the store. I want my son to be the first one to ring that bell so loud that the whole town will hear. - Really?! - - Really. - All right! - - All right. - Okay. You guys get some sleep, okay? - Dad? I love you. - I know, son. Love you guys. Night! Mmm, Mama Bear! Papa Bear wants some honey. - Come on then, Papa Bear. - Come on, Jake! - Come on, Jake! - I'm comin', hold on. - Jake, where ya going? I made your favorite, mashed potatoes and gravy! - I'm just going out with the boys to get some beers. That's all. No harm. - When did you start drinking again? - Come on! - Who are those boys? - Snake and Matty. I met 'em at the stables, hangin' around. - Do they work there? - No. Listen, Carrie. Just put my food on the warmer. I'll be back later, all right? Hey, their uncle is Sheriff Joe Cain. I mean how much trouble could I get in? - Okay. - I'll see you later! - I love you. - I know you do. - Let me guess, she made your favorite. You know, Jake, 50% of marriages fail for a reason. - Don't do nothing stupid now. - Just gonna scare 'em, Joe. That's it. - That's it. - You got it, Joe. - You're gonna go on a little ride with me and Matty here. - Sheriff. - Raise 'em up, boys. To the brotherhood. To the brotherhood. - Brotherhood. - Woo! - Ah! - Burns. - You boys have fun, now. - You sure know how to make a man feel good, Mama Bear. - I'm just proud of you. You been working so, so hard, for so long, on this one. - Still a lot to do. Got a long way to go. - You sure you and Seth know what you doing? - Well, we gonna be all right. If the store is successful, it can go a long way in healing a lot of old wounds. Besides, honey. God done brought us this far. We can't turn around now. - Okay. You comin' in? - I'll be in in a minute. - I trust you, Bob. - Okay. - I know what you all up to. I don't want no trouble. This is my property. Go on home, now. If you leave now, we'll just act like this never happened. - I tell you what. Kinda hoping you don't forget. I don't think you're understanding me. The big picture, we don't like you. We don't want you here. - I don't care whether you like me or not. What I do know, this is my property! I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Now, get on outta here! - Bob? - It's okay, Emma. Just get on back inside. Go on. Get back inside. - Done gone and made me real mad. - Shep, get 'em! - No! What're you doing?! - No, no, no, Jakey. You're one of us. Remember? The brotherhood. We gonna burn 'em. - Burn 'em? - Matty? - - Yeah? - Light it up. - Now? - Right now. - No, Matty! No! Matty, don't do it. - Fire works. - Throw it on the porch. - No, Matty! Don't do it! He's got kids in there. - Get in the truck. Now! - Bob lost his wife and two kids. - Yeah, it's a real pity. - Doesn't look like an accident. - Of course, it was. - There's a bottle on the porch. - Hey! It was an accident. - Sure. - How do we rise above the ashes of such a loss? The loss of a good woman, and her two innocent children? This is an unthinkable pain. A pain that reaches to the deepest recesses of our soul. There are no human words to console, but there is comfort in His word. The word ministers to our soul, calms our spirit, brings new life into us, and gives us the reason to live again. "Fear not, for I am with you." Isaiah 41:10. - The last thing I said to my wife was, "Trust in God." It was God that let this happen. - I could use a little help around the store today. - I plan on going fishing. - I'm going fishing, too. - Sit down, sweetie. - May I be excused? - You haven't finished eating yet. - Go. - Yes, Ma. - Yeah, go. What? Tell. - You know I have nightmares. I do. I see that flaming bottle in my sleep. Why Bob? - We can't change the past. We have to move on. - You even know where he lives? - No, I don't. He wants it that way. - Is that what you tell yourself? - You don't think I want him to come back? You don't think I haven't tried? He hardly talks anymore. Not even to me. He comes into the store, gets what he needs, and leaves. He's built a wall around himself, and ain't nobody gonna get through that. - Then, you've got to keep trying. - Jake? Jake. You need to go home now, son. - It's early. - - Yup. - You were out all night again. - I'm tired. - I am, too. - Yeah, well I work all day long. - So do I. - Yeah, right. - What, you think I just sit around all day? Can't be going out on the town, spending our money on drinking. - Yeah, our money. You mean, my money. I earned it. It's my money. I earn it. I'll do what I wanna do with it. You could get a job. You can go out and pay the bills, and I'll stay home and play with the kids. - You don't even know your kids. - That rabbit. If you'd have been there... you would've caught that rabbit, and I wouldn't have to waste time throwing that knife. I do miss 'em though. I miss 'em, boy. Now, I'm out here by myself. Ain't nobody but me and you. You my best friend now. You're my everything now. Yeah. - I got you! - Who's there? Man, am I hearing things? Huh?! What?! Hey, wait. Come back here! Come back here. I'm gonna get you! You can't get away from me! Come here! Think you can mess with me? - Had your head spinning. - That was luck. Here, give me your hand. Now, if you don't mind, I have some fish to catch. - Wait. Where you going? Can't you tell me? - No. - Is it a secret? Well, if you ain't gonna tell me, then I'm just gonna follow you. - Here it is. The best fishing spot around. - Wow. I ain't never seen this. - You just have to know the right path to follow. Come on. - Here, let me help. First, you need some real bait. Fresh from the soil. Deer jerky, take a little pull of this to give it some extra muscle. - Wait, did you just pull the worm and the deer jerky out of the same pocket? - It looks cool when you chew it, too. - Did your dad teach you how to cast a pole? - I ain't got no daddy. - Maybe you could meet my dad. - I got something! - You did? - Bay, I actually got something! - Hold onto it with two hands! - Help me! Help me! Grab it! Grab it! Grab it! - I got it. I got it. Oh! - Hey, hey! - - We caught a fish! - It's slippery. - Well, duh, it's slippery. It's been in the water. - High five! Give me a high five! What do you see? - A Bigfoot and a dog. - Wait! What?! - Let me see! - - Shh! - We gotta go! - Run! - Come on! Let's get outta here! Hey, wanna do this again after church? - Church? - - Yeah! - Don't you go to church? - I've never been. - The church is on the hill, off of Old Route 37, just past the fork in the road. You can't miss it. All you have to do is just look up. - Okay, see ya then. - - Okay, bye. - Mom says you went fishing. Bet you didn't catch nothin'. - Not much. - Not much? - What're you two up to? No good? - Thinkin' about it. - Sheriff. I need to get your signature on these reports. - You sign 'em. - Yes, sir. - Whatcha need? A little cash'd be good. - You boys ever gonna settle down, find you a good woman, maybe a job? - Why? - You got me. Why work, when you can mooch? - Thank you, Uncle Joe. Hey, uhh... You ever hear anything else about the older Collins brother? - What older Collins brother? - Hey, Pete. - Hey, Jake. What're you drinking? - The usual. - - You got it. - Where you been, Jake? Ain't seen you in a while. - That's five. - You're not too good for us now, are you? - Thanks. - No, just not, you know? I been in a mood lately. - Wanna have a little fun tonight? Pop some coyotes? - Nah, not tonight. - Gotta get that fire outta your head, boy. It's been a while, now. You startin' to make me real nervous. I get a little crazy... when I get nervous. - A little crazy? Now, you know that man saw us. - What I know... is that that old man... way off in the woods. Which is exactly where we want him. Hey, Gibby! Deputy Gibby! Be sure to tell this fine, little lady here you ain't never kissed no girl. I mean you're law man, after all. You should always tell the truth. - Yeah, Snake. Whatever, okay? Well, you know I've got my uniform in the car. I can go put it on and arrest you. - You catch yourself another beatin' like you did last year. Keep runnin' that mouth. - Just... joking. - A joke. - Now, you know you ain't the law around here. - Well, sure we are! Don't you forget that. Law around here... is what we make it. What is this, church?! Who wants to drink with the brotherhood, huh?! Fill me up, Matty! - You been in your head all morning, Jake. What's going on? - I'm good. - No. No, you're not. I've known you long enough to know when something's up, so what's up? - Thinking about leaving Carrie, moving onto another town. I don't know. Just wanna be by myself. - What about the kids? Your job? You just can't run off. - Why not? I woke up this morning doubting everything, Frank. I got two kids and a wife I can't relate to. - Yeah, well no one said marriage is easy. You have to work at it. - I tried, Frank. I mean no offense. I'm thankful for the job you've given me at the stable, but there's gotta be something more. - It's an honest living. You're providing for your family. - Yeah, barely. - You know that my wife gave up on me. Gave up on us. Thought there was something better out there, I guess. Long time, I blamed myself, but eventually I realized it wasn't my fault. She just didn't wanna be married anymore. She did the easy thing and just gave up on the marriage. See, the problem with doing that though is it creates a lot of pain on both sides. Trust me. Think about this, Jake. Think about what you're doing. - Well, maybe people ought not get married. - You know what you have? Beautiful wife, beautiful kids... I want that. I'll probably never have a child of my own. But I want what you have. - Thou shalt not covet. You just broke a commandment. - Yeah, I think you know what I mean. - I'm sorry for throwing all this on you, Frank. - Then maybe you should put those big-boy pants on and man up. Be a father. Be a husband. It's family, Jake. It's the greatest gift of all. - I'm done. - Lord, we bless your name. Hallelujah! Come on, put your hands together for our preacher, Preacher Sam, come on! - Amen! What a wonderful God we have! This morning, my sermon comes to you from the book of... - What're you doing here? - I figured I'd come try it out. - Who, among you, if he has 100 sheep, and loses one of them, does not leave the 99 in the wasteland, and follow the last one until he finds it? There will likewise be more rejoicing in heaven over the repentance of one sinner, than over 99 righteous people who have no need to repent. - Amen! - - Amen! - When those Cain boys gonna repent? - We let the law do its job. - Preacher, that sheriff ain't done nothin' about what happened to that man's family. - We put our trust in God. We don't follow man's law, we follow God's law. Amen, let the church say amen. - You did pretty good up there. - Oh, I get a little happy, if you know what I mean. Preacher Sam, pleased to meet you. - Hey, Preacher Sam. - Who are the Cain brothers? - They're a couple of boys needing prayers. - Let's go, Puck. - Nice meeting you, Preacher Sam. - Nice meeting you, too. - Come on, let's go! - Okay! - Stick 'em up! - You scared the crawdads outta me, Bay! Don't do that! - Now, we're even. You seen anything? - Ain't seen nothin' yet. Old man's been sleeping on his porch. Seems like forever. - You'd think he'd be thirsty, or hungry... - Hasn't moved a muscle. I just don't get how he could stay still for that long. - I could stay still forever. - Pff, sure. - - Yeah. - Get off, Bay. - What're you talking about? - Get your hands off of me! - What're you talking about? Get your hands off... Uncle Bob? - Come on. - Oh, we're so busted. - You know better, Bay. - Oh, no. No wonder he didn't move. - Here. Sit down. - Yes, Sir. - You wanna tell me why you two been snoopin' around my property? Trespassing is against the law. You know that, don't you? - I wouldn't mind being that scarecrow right now. - It was her idea. I just wanted to go home. - What?! You know you wanted to check him out! You said he was some sort of Bigfoot or something. - Did not! - - Did so! - I did not! You. You have some real neat stuff, Uncle Bob. Did you make all this?! - Yeah, it's all pretty cool. Wish I could make stuff like this. - Come on, Puck. - Yeah. I made 'em. - The other day, I was looking at a picture on your mantle. Is that your family? I'm Puck. What's your dog's name? - Shep. - Cool, I like that name. Come on, Bay. - Bye, Uncle Bob. - Every time I see that tree over there, it reminds me of when I was a little boy, and me and my daddy, we planted this little seed that grew into something really beautiful. That's how God is with us. He takes our family, and He rains down his love, and we become all that we can be. - Bob? - I love you, too, Daddy. - Dad, I love you. - I know, son. Love you guys. - I trust you, Bob. - What you doing, son? - Changing the battery, but I wanna check the oil first. - Yeah? All right, well I don't have to be at work for a while. Would you like to go for a walk? - I'll go when you get back. It's just a battery. - It's just a battery. Looks good. Sounds good. All right, I'll see you in a bit. - Want some lemonade? - Yeah. - Hello? - Hey, Bob. I, uhh... got your things. Salt, sugar, cereal, toothpaste, and toilet paper. It's good to see you, Bob. Man, these are beautiful. Even trade? - Even. - I know how you like your licorice. Hey, Bob? The preacher gave a good sermon today... on forgiveness. - All right, that's good. Here you go, boy. Most of us start work first thing in the morning, Jake. Not last. - I'm sorry, Frank. - Just get to work. - Jakey! You ready for a big one tonight? - I'm working overtime tonight. - Come on, now. Bang, bang, bang. Don't you love me no more? - Just got stuff I gotta figure out. - What you got to work out, Jake? What, another way to smash on them horseshoe? Now, you ain't been much of a team player lately. Seems like you've got it in your head that you different somehow. You're just like us. - I ain't nothin' like you. - Fine. - I'm going over to Bob Collins. - No, no, no. See, you ain't. For one, Jake, you ain't got the stones. Two... I'll just stop you. - You just try it. - Break it up! I said break it up! - Big boy thinks he can throw punches around. - Shut your mouth, boy. You been drinking, Jake? Just go on home. You know better than that. - I need the money, Frank. - If you need the money, you won't come to work drinking tomorrow, now will you? You, and your brother, and that so-called sheriff think you got this town wrapped up. I can't speak for everyone else around here because they're too afraid to speak up. But, you boys are no good. - See ya around, hero. - You do know that, in the State of Texas, if you trespass, that's grounds for getting shot? I keep my rifle loaded all day long. I see you coming around here again, I just might mistake you for a coyote trying to steal my chickens. You think that's funny? I guess we'll just have to see what happens, won't we? Now get off my land. - Sure, hoss. Whatever you say. - Hello? - Hey, Carrie. - Hi, Frank, how are you? - Oh, I'm fine. It's just... Look, I had to send Jake home. I lost my temper a bit. He got in a scuffle with one of the Cain brothers. Jake's been drinking again, too. - Oh. If you need anything, I'll help if I can. - Okay. Thanks, Frank. - Where were you? - Work. - Got in a fight, huh? - Yeah, I got in a fight. - Frank called to check on you. The electricity was turned off last night. - Well, I paid it. - Well, obviously you didn't! - Would you two stop yelling? - Don't talk to your daddy like that, please. - I ain't got no daddy. Daddy, what is a daddy?! - You listen to your mom, and you be quiet. - I don't wanna be quiet. All you do is yell and scream! Why can't I, huh?! - Get out! Get out! Get out! Leave! Get out of here! Get out of here! Goodbye. Puck. Puck. Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck! Puck! - Ooh! Ah! That blanket is stinky! My, I can't see how you can stand to lay on that thing. Well... gonna get a wash today, 'cause I can't stand it anymore. That is disgusting! My! All right. There we go. All right, now. No! No, no, no! Shep, come on now! Come on, move! No, let it... Shep! Let it go. Let it go! Shep, will you let it go?! Just take it. Take it! Take it! - Puck? Puck, it's me, Bay. - Just leave me alone. - What's the matter? - Nothing, I'm fine. - No, you're not, or you wouldn't be crying. - I ain't crying. - Look at me, Puck. What happened?! - I busted my lip on a rock. - Somebody hit you, didn't they? - My daddy hit me. He was all drunk, so I guess it's okay. He don't smack me when he ain't drunk. - He shouldn't be hitting you, Puck. Drinking or not, that just isn't right. - That's just Jake. - You have to tell someone, Puck. - Who am I going to tell? Besides, ain't no one to listen anyway. - How about telling my dad? He'll listen to you, Puck. - I'll be okay. - Come on. Come on, Puck. - Mm-mmm. - Come on. Come on. - Hey, son. - Hey, Dad. - Hey, grab a seat. Move that stuff outta the way there. - Okay, Dad. - Be right with you. - What's going on, son? - Dad, this is my new friend, Puck. She got hurt. - Ah, you got hurt? Let me see. Well, well, well. You know, I think I have just the thing that'll fix you right up. I told you he was nice. - Fresh strawberries. Go ahead. Take one. Tell me what you think. - Yeah? - - I'll take one. - I know you will take one. - Thank you. - You're very welcome. Ah, there's that smile. - Well, we'll be going, Papa. - All right. Where you off to? - Fishing. - Of course. Fishing. Come here, you. - Come on, Puck. - Hey, Puck. - - Yeah? - Why don't you take these with you? - Thank you. - Ooh, yeah. More strawberries. - Give some to your mom! I love you, son. - Love you, too, Dad. - Bye. - Well, Mr. Billy, another satisfied customer. - There he goes. - Where we going, Snake? - Come on, Jake. - All right, Snake. Comin' up on me. - There you go, Jake. We just gonna play a little game of chicken. - Come on, Snake! Floor it! Cut him off! Yes! - We gonna circle around. - Jakey! How about that brotherhood now? - Ain't no brotherhood... with you or your crazy, law man uncle. What? You think 'cause you got a job, and you earn a paycheck, you're some kind of role model? You're a liar, Joe. A 10-star-wearin' liar. You know what they did. Covering it up like a hole in a wall. - Now, don't you be talking to my family like that, boy. - I know what's behind that wall. Them cries from them kids. That poor man's wife. They didn't do nothing to you. Them cries are coming to get ya, all three of you. You just wait. - Why don't you boys hit the road? Beat it! You know something, Jake? I could come up with about a dozen legal reasons to put a bullet through your head right now. But, lucky for me, I only need one. - Sheriff? Everything all right? - Just fine. Get this cleaned up. - Tell you what, you be sure and tell your mom I said hello, and have her stop by the shop, okay? - Okay. - James? You do the... - Ow! You do the same. Tell your dad I said hi. - Okay. - - Bye-bye, now. - Can we go get some ice cream? - What you doing, Carl? - Hey, Seth. How you doing, bro? - Licorice? - - For me? - Hell yeah. - Licorice. Don't mind if I do. Thanks, bro. - Come on by tonight, Carl. Your sister's cooking your favorite. - I remember a picture on this wall, right here, of me and my daddy holding a big, old fish. Right over here, was a picture of my daddy winning the gun show. Good times, huh? I believe I'll have me some of this black licorice. One of them carvings, too. Who makes these anyway? - My brother, Bob. - Didn't know you had a brother. - Yeah, you did. You murdered his wife and two kids. That'll be $4.78. - Thanks for the licorice. - Sheriff. I can't have your little nephews come into my store and stealing from me. - Who? Snake and Matty? They ain't no harm. - You mean like the no harm they did to my brother and his family? - Oh. The accident. - We ain't calling that no accident. - Well, seems to me you're gonna have to. Now, that happened months ago. People have left alone what should be. If you wanna go starting that all up again, you be my guest. But, you know those boys. You start something, I might have to look the other way. - Yeah. You're real good at that, aren't you, Sheriff? - You got a real nice store there. Nice families. You 'bout done here, boys, 'cause I'm getting hungry. - Me too. - Mr. Knight, you're gonna be fine, sir. You've been transported to USMD Hospital at Arlington. You were in a car accident, and you hit your head pretty hard. Just try to relax. Let me go get some pain medicine and some ice chips. - Thank you. - Some pretty nice strawberries in the kitchen there. Honey, I'm so sorry. I love you so much. - I know, Mom. I love you, too. - Your daddy, he loves you, too. He's just having a hard time. - It's okay. My new friend, Bay, took me to see his dad's store. He has everything in there. That's where I got strawberries from. He said we could come by any time. - I think that'd be a great idea. We're gonna be okay. Okay? Hold on, I'll be right back. Hello? - Carrie, it's Frank. - Hi, Frank. - Jake's been in a car accident. - Where is he? - USMD. - Okay, I'll be right there. Puck, we've gotta go. Barry! Where is your brother? Puck, go put on a clean shirt. - Paging Dr. Porter. Paging Dr. Porter. Dr. Porter, please pick up a red phone. - Frank. - Hey. It's okay. He's okay. Your dad's okay. He had his seatbelt on. - I was so upset. He was so angry. - I know. Jake hasn't been himself for some time now. To be honest, I've almost had to fire him, more than once. Don't worry, his job is safe. When he's straight, he's the best worker I've ever had. But, something is eating him up inside. If we don't help him beat whatever demons he's fighting, it's just gonna get worse. - Miss Carrie. - - Yeah. - Your husband's gonna be okay. - I'll stay here. - I'm sorry, baby. I love you. - I love you, too. - Okay. - We'll be all right. - Here you go, Therese. - Thanks. - Hey, Ruby. How's Jake Knight doing? - He's in some pain, but I'm ordering him some pain medicine. - Okay, good. It could've been a lot worse. Must have a guardian angel, that's for sure. - Yes sir, Doc. - I'll be in Room 3. - Thank you, Doctor. - Hey, Frank. - How's it going? - Oh, you know. Is Carrie here? - She went to get coffee. Told her I'd hold down the fort for a while. But, you know what? I don't do bed pans. - Oh, man. I sure could go for one of your greasy hamburgers. Spicy ketchup, mustard. - Ask, and you shall receive. - Seek, and you shall find. - Knock, and the door shall be opened. - Look at you. I didn't know you knew any Bible verses. - Yeah, well, Pops. - Hey. Don't tell Miss Ruby. - We'll get you back on your feet. There's a little something extra in there to help you out. - I can't take this. - It'll help out, but it's not gonna fix your problem. - Yeah, well thanks for the hamburger. - I am not gonna let you off that easy, Jake. There are people who care about you. They worry about what you're doing to your life. They wanna help you, and you can't even see that. You're walking down Gallows Road. I know, 'cause I've been there myself. It's a dark road, son. It's like you're blindfolded. When you get to the end of that road, there's these wooden steps you have to go up. It's like you're in quicksand. You're just sinking deeper and deeper. When you get to the top, there's a scaffold with a rope hanging on it. The rope makes this... high-pitched screeching sound as that knot digs into the side of your neck. Just like that, your feet are free of land. Snap. You break. The most important thing about Gallows Road, Jake, is this. That blindfold that you're wearing, you put it there yourself. You can't be pointing fingers and blaming everyone else for your problems. You wanna make your life better? Then, do it. Get off that road. You can turn back any time you want. But, you're the one that's gotta take that first step. - I was there. I just stood and watched. - Watched what? - Matty Cain threw a flaming torch at Bob Collin's porch. I tried to help 'em, but Snake put a gun to my chest. - That was an accident, so they say. - Yeah. So they say. - Yeah. - What's worse than a man dying... is not being able to live. I'm a coward, Frank. - You're not a coward. You made a mistake. Fix it. - I ain't worth fixing. I'm already gone. - Nobody gone. You're off course, that's all. - I can't sleep. I can't work. I can't get through a day without drinking. I keep seeing them two kids, and that man's poor wife. My kids, they don't know me. And my wife, she's afraid of me. I wish I could take that night back, Frank, but I can't. - There ain't no sin... greater than God's forgiveness, Jake. - Forgiveness? So, God's gonna forgive me, just like that? - Yeah. Just like that. Says so right here in the Good Book. You know how you get it? - How? - You just ask. - Hey, Shep. Come on now. Hey, boy, I got your favorite. Here. Here you go, Shep. Shep? Shep? Shep, come on now. Here, it's your favorite. Shep. Come on, Shep. Come on, Shep. Don't you die on me, too. Aw, Shep. Shep. - Bay came to see me. - He found you, huh? - Yeah, he found me. He's a good boy. You all doing a good job with him. He gettin' tall. Maybe gonna be as big as his daddy. - So, what you saying? - Just saying. - I'm real sorry, Bob. - Know what I remember? It was really hot that night. I can still smell the flowers. My wife was looking nice. Mary and Michael... Those kids... were the sunshine of my life. - I know. We all miss 'em. Life just isn't fair. - You don't know. But, you're right. Life just isn't fair. - Bobby, you ever think about forgiving that boy? - What boy? - Jake. He got a little girl, young. You ever think about the pain and the guilt that he has to live with? - You ever think about what I have to live without? I lost... my two kids. My wife. What about my kids? They should be out playing. Me and the kids. What about my wife? Who I got to come home to? - You... You could go back off in them woods and hide in your cave, your safe place... like I did when Dad died. Or you can put God here, right here. 'Cause when you got God, you're safe anywhere. Now, I know I can't make you do nothing that you don't wanna do. But, you gotta keep moving, big brother. You walked out on me, Bobby. You walked out on me and this store. Our store. You runnin' and hidin' off in them woods. You ain't doing nobody no good. You ain't got to run and hide no more, Bobby. You got friends and family that love you and miss you. I'm your only brother, Bobby. I miss you. Please. Please... come to church with me this Sunday just like old times. - That what you think I been doing? Hiding? You ain't got to go to no church to talk to God. I been talking to God. I made me some decision. I'm gonna kill them boy. All three of 'em. Thanks for the licorice. - Hello? Hello? - Jessie. - Seth? - - Yes. - It's me, honey. - Baby, you okay? - I'm okay. I just called to tell you I love you. - Bay, go to your room. What's wrong? - It's Bob. - What do you mean? - He knows they coming for him. He's gonna kill 'em, Jessie. - Baby? - - I gotta go. - Where are you going? Seth. Bay! - I'm gonna smoke that man out like a rat, finish what we started. - And you're sure you wanna do this? - I never been more. - Forgive me, God. - One, two, three, four. - Okay! - Now, we're even. - Killed ya. - Let's play again. - Jake Knight's room, please? Jake? Someone's been here. - Where? - Our house. I was taking the trash out, - and I... - Carrie? - I'm coming home. - Jake? - Okay, good. Ms. Combs seems to be doing better. Vitals are good. Let's go ahead and take her off Demerol, switch her to Tylenol. - Okay. - Mr. Knights. Okay, good. His x-ray, CT came back negative. Still wanna monitor him one more day. If he's tolerating liquids, just remove his IV. - Yes, sir. - Hello, this is Frank. - Hey, Frank. I need to borrow another work truck. - What're you doing outta the hospital? You need your rest. - I can rest when this is over. - No, Jake. Listen to me. Jake. Jake, what're you doing? - I gotta go. - Jake. Jake! - Barry. - - Dad? - Are you okay?! - I'm okay. Puck. Show me what you saw. Carrie, I want you to listen to me. When I leave, I want you to take Barry and Puck into the bedroom and lock that door. - Okay. - I want you to lock the front door, - and I'll be back soon. - - Okay. - I'm afraid, Jake. - Don't be. - Okay. - We're a family. You understand me? We're a family. - Seth? - Preacher Sam. Can we talk? - Sure. - My brother come to me. He told me something very unsettling. - Seth? - He said he gonna kill them Cain boys, and Jake, too. - He can't do that, Seth. - Oh, he can. And, he will. He ain't got nothing left to lose. - You go to the person who wronged you, and forgive them. - Preacher Sam, you and I both know it ain't that easy. They took his little boy. They took his little girl. And they took his wife. And I'm starting to take it real personal. - Seth, I'm here for you, always. - But, if you was me... what would you do? - I'd have to ask you to pray for me. - There he is, Carl! You had me scared to death. Are you okay? - I'm sorry, Mama. - Come on. Take me to Bob. - Yes, ma'am. - Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. But, lead us not into temptation. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory. Amen. - Why don't you come on out in the light, Bob? Where I can see you. - You took my family, my blood! Took 'em from me. - Come on now, Bob. You gonna sit there nice and quiet, and burn. Just like your wife and kids did. - Gonna kill you, Snake, you and your brother there. You all ain't gonna do no harm to nobody... no more. - Why? - This ain't about no store. - You're right though. I just don't like you. I don't like your family. I don't like your kind. But, I tell you what it is about. It's about the blood. It's about the scavengers. And it's about your blood to spill. - You're pure hate. May God forgive you. - Never was no God in my world. - My God. You're gonna wish there was. - This is my battle, little brother. - It's our battle, bro. - Put the gun down, Snake. - Two birds, one gun. Matty. Put that gun on Bob's little brother here. Matty! - Sheriff. 10-33. We have three armed suspects inside the old Aledo mill. They're in a standoff position, and they have their weapons drawn. - Copy that. Hold the perimeter. Do not make a move until I get there. I'm on my way. - David 927, I'll be en route. - Sheriff. Snake, Matty, and Jake... They're in there with Bob Collins. - I heard you the first time, Gibby. Do not move! I'm on my way. Confirmed. Gibby. Gibby! - Who's this? - My husband is in there, isn't he, Carl? - Jessie, stay in. - You tell me. - He's in there, isn't he? - I don't know... - No, no, no! - Jessie! Your husband is inside. Weapons are drawn. I need you to stay calm. - Uncle Bob! - Bay? Where's Bay?! - Papa! - - Bay! - Bay! Go on and get outta here! - No, Papa! Don't do this! - Run! Get outta here now! - No, Papa. Not without you or Uncle Bob. - Let me go! If something happens to my husband or child, I'll come after you myself. You will feel from a woman like you have never! - Don't you have a mama or papa? I know if you did, they would miss you. Forgive. I forgive you! - Snake? - No! - Put your weapons down! - Are you okay? - On the ground now! Hands above you head! Do it now! Do it now! Snake? - I got one in custody. - Please. Please, Bob. Please forgive me. - I already have, son. - Snake, don't leave me, brother. I don't want to be the last wolf. - Start medical, we got one here with a gunshot wound, left chest, one down. Stay with me, man. Stay with me. Tell 'em to step it up. We need 'em code out here. Talk to me. Come on, talk to me. Come on. Stay with me. - Hey, Bob. - Hey, Seth. - You ready to do this? - I guess so. - Let's get going then. Hey, kids! Your Uncle Bob is here. - Hey. - - Hey. - Bay. Hi, Maji. - Hey, Bob! - Hi, Jessie. - Today is a good day. - It is, Jessie. - Why don't you all go on ahead, and give us a moment. - Sure. Come on, kids. Let's go. We'll leave you two alone. - I just... need a few moments to catch my breath. I don't know if I can do this. - Bob. Yes, you can. Look, I... I was saving this for just the right moment. Little welcome-back gift from the family. You know you can't ignore God, Bob. - Yeah, that is... hard to do. - See ya there? - Oh, yeah. I'll be there. - Today is a very important day in our community. We welcome back a member. Bob Collins. When you hear the word community, oftentimes you think of it as small. But, we're not small here. We have big hearts, big dreams, hard-working people all working together to improve the lives of our families. In a city, whether small or large, there's a common thread. Together, we struggle. And together, we love. So together, today, please join us in celebrating the opening of the Collins brothers' antique store. Bob, would you do the favor? - I'd be honored. All right. - You did good, Jake. - Thanks for not giving up on me, Frank. - I'm proud of you, and so is your family. You did the right thing. - Well, I'm staying here. I'm not going anywhere. With my family. - I wanna go in the antique store - right now. - - All right, let's go. - Hey, what about that bird call? You were gonna teach me. - Try this. - My turn. - We need to work on that. - Okay, so my bird call doesn't impress you, but how about? Here we go.
