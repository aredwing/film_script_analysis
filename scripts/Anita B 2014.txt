Isaac Bashevis SINGER May 1945, right after World War 2 Hungarian/Czech border. Morning... -Hi. You must be tired with all this snow... sign here. How are you? Anita? Did the Red Cross treat you good? Have you seen your old house in Budapest? Why aren't you speaking? You know who am I? I'm Eli, Aron's brother, got it? Aron, Monika's husband. May I get a kiss? Are you hungry? When did you eat last time? Stand down! Are you ok? See? You're safe with me. Monika made these for us. You want mine too? Here... Aren't you hot? Why don't you take off your hat? Come on, take it off... Sorry... How did you save yourself? -I escaped before the nazis arrived... Have you been hiding all this time? In a farm....with my brother and your aunt Monika. Mom... I see Prague in front of me... You wished to come here for your birthday, with dad and me... Remember? Who are you talking to? Mom always talked about Prague... we dreamed of seeing it together. Anita.... wake up, we have to get off. Let me stay! I'm a carpenter, I can work! We're Germans, we're not nazis! There's kids, don't hurt them! They're Sudetes... Czech Germans that supported Hitler... They send them back to Germany and luckily we get their houses. After what they've done, they deserved it. See? They're erasing the past. War has changed everything. I was born in Hungary, but now I'm Czech... we all speak different languages here. We don't know who we are anymore. And me? Who am I? Right now, no one.... later, we'll see... Are you married? I want to live... When you're married you can't live? Men only need to take off their pants, but women....they want love... You've never been in love? You ask too many questions... learn to bite life instead, like this... Sorry... Here we are. Last floor, that's our home. Don't tell Monika what I said about women... I was only joking. Anyway... leave Auschwitz out of this house. Monika, we're home. Aunt Monika... Don't call me aunt... just Monika. And don't cry, Roby's asleep. Take off your shoes and these dirty clothes. How was the trip? Did your escort behave? -I did. Good. I made a chicken soup, but... You better wash first, and you as well... those trains are filled with lice and fleas. Yes Wash... come on. There's no much water, but we're lucky just to have some. Everything is rationed. You better hide this... communists are not kind to Jews. Here... dry up. And put this on. Come. This is Eli's bed... You can sleep here. Soon as we got some money I'm gonna throw this furniture... They belonged to the Sudetes that lived here... it's all theirs, damn them.... Back in Budapest I saw our old house... Do you remember our neighbor's son? He helped you escape... Mom thought he would have helped us all, but they deported him too. Did you know? They took him the day after you escaped... didn't you know? Could you change subject? Anybody home? Something smells good. Monika! How's little niece? -Dressing up... Listen... don't tell her about her hair... Look, uncle Jacob came as well. Zulejka! -Zulejka? Aron has a nickname for everyone. Eli is Rapa, Roby is Robika, I am Viola... Violetta when he drinks... Turn around and let me look at you... What a pretty niece we got! Like this I look like a scarecrow... Complaining already? No, the dress is beautiful... but I'm too skinny. Don't worry, we'll fatten you up good... right brother? Zulejka... he is uncle Jacob, aka Jankele. He isn't actually anybody's uncle, but he's the uncle we all wish we had... He's gonna take care of your papers. Zulejka, do you know how we say scarecrow in Yiddish? Shrek-foygl. To life! Roby! -Wait... don't touch him, he doesn't know you yet. Clean your room next, I'll clean Roby's myself. Mom, I've been here in Zvikovske for 6 months now... Now I'm truly fine, you know... My hair has grown back and Aron is making me eat so much that I could explode... The only grief is not being able to talk to anyone about what we've been through... Besides Roby, but he's too young to understand... In all this time, I never got out of the house... I have to wait for my documents first, or else, as Eli says... I am no one. No... that's not true... I am Anita. I'm Anita, even if my documents aren't ready. This is the house where Anita lived with her mom and dad. And these are the kids with whom she played. Say it with me... "kids"... -Kids... And here lived Anita after they took her away. In the day she worked for the soldiers... Then back to the camp to sleep. Everyday the same... day after day after day.... Then one morning different soldiers came and told Anita she was free. Though at first she didn't wanna leave... You know why? Cause her mom and dad were still in that camp. Mom... I dreamed Hitler was alive and on trial for killing 6 millions Jews. He complained and said that wasn't true... He said he only killed 5,900,000.... So the judge absolved him. Then I dreamed I became a wizard and did resuscitate you and dad with a magic wand. We hug and laughed... Then we went for felafel, which dad loves so much... We were so happy... Done? Finally some American music. So, what do you think? -About what? Look for yourself. Again the Russians... What happened? Some interference? Yea...always the Russians. Look... I got the magic touch. Stop it! Stop it or I'll scream. -You're in love with me, admit it. No way! Don't you wanna see me naked? -Go to sleep, it's late... No... Women love to see me naked, you know? But you're not a woman, what do you know.... You're just a little girl... Nighty-night... Anita! What's that for? -You can help me decorate it... We'll put it in the landing so the neighbors will see it. It's better if they don't know we're Jewish. What's wrong with being Jewish? Nobody can know you're here until you get your papers. If Roby awakes, give him the milk that's left. -Yes, don't worry Monika. Thanks. What's your name? -Anita. I'm Edith... do you like music? Oh, yes... -Can you play? Anita! Oh my God! Roby! Anita would love to buy you a gift, Roby... but she ain't got a dime. You know who Anita is, right? A-ni-ta. Can you say Anita? A-ni-ta! Don't we wait for Eli? -Of course not... he's always late. Quit picking on Eli, you're getting boring. Eat, Zulejka. Delicious! You gonna be a great chef. Did you see what a good painter Zulejka is? Let's make her paint the whole house. So we cancel all traces of Sudetes. If she's got time... Zulejka, what you wanna do when you grow up? She says she wants to study. She'll take a sewing class at most. Monika... Don't be so rude to her, she's not as tough as she looks like. She wouldn't have survived if she wasn't tough. Survive is one thing, live is another... remember what she's been through. And what about me? What I've been through doesn't count? I lost everything, even the house. You didn't see your mom and dad pushed into a gas chamber. I remind you he was my brother! Are you asleep? See what a pretty nanny you got? What did you do? Nothing... just kissing his feet... He never cries for nothing. Did you bite him? -No I didn't... Get the tub ready and make the bed. It's over... Aunt Monika... -Yes? When will I go out? How many times do I have to tell you? If they catch you with no documents they arrest you. Get dressed, we go out. Out this late? You're crazy... I don't have any documents, you know... Are there any carrots in the kitchen? But... why? -Yes or no? Yes... Monika bought 'em yesterday. -Good, dress up, take the carrots and come with me. Hold on! We go fast downhill! Where is he? There he is! He's coming. Look how beautiful... Give it to me. Good boy... He comes when you whistle... -Yes... Before the end of the war I worked in a farm, I was training him. Then the farm was collectivized and I ended up in a factory. Good boy... At least he's free... I wonder if he likes it. Ask him. -You're making fun of me... What's his name? He ain't got no name, I don't like giving names to animals. Like if we owned them. Here, give him the carrots...he loves them. Loves them... Run! Go! Run! Let's go, it's late. If Monika awakes and we're not back she's gonna get mad. Come. So, do you like him? Yes. Anita? Anita... Why you're still at home? A strike at the factory. -And where's Anita? Probably in the bathroom, she washes her hair all the time. Go get Roby ready. Then we'll get you a nice dress for Sunday night. -Sunday night? There's a party. -And I can come too? Aron says it's alright. If they ask for my papers? With all that people no one will pay attention to you. Aren't you happy? Play with the kid. Anita, come... I'll introduce you to some friends. If someone asks, you're not Hungarian. -Why? Cause Hungarians were on the nazi side. -We had no choice, we were forced... We'll discuss it later, let's go. Here's our little niece, Anita. -Nice dress... Zulejka... this is Mr. Roth, our benefactor. She's Sarah... she's born in Palestine... Our guide to the promised land. To Life! Let's dance! Come. -Go ahead. Not bad... not bad... Just let yourself go. Good... like that... Where did you learn? -In Budapest. She's Hungarian... I knew you like to dance. And I know you like me. Come on, admit it. You're crazy about me. Are you crazy? They'll see us! You mean if nobody sees us I can kiss you? Guys... she dances like a dove! Don't you drink anymore? I'll finish it then. State police. This girl is foreign, I need to see her papers. They'll be ready shortly. I'm sorry... she's coming with us... Please... her papers will be ready in a week. That's what you Jews always say.... the girl has no papers and can't be here... come with us... Eli! -Don't you touch her! Are you insane? Shut up! Anita! Shut up! We're trying to sleep. Wash yourself and put on this. You too wash... get up! I dress as I like! You don't like how I dress? I do! We all must dress like you? Get your hands off me! Don't touch me, you pigs! Are you German? What's a little girl doing here? I ain't got my papers yet. We need papers to live in this shitty world... Uncle Jacob got the papers! Get dressed... we're taking you home. How's a going with the trips to Palestine? Not that good. Are the English still blocking our ships? Our people won't give up until the English are gone. The English will leave eventually, but the Arabs will not. Then we gonna live with the bible in one hand and a gun in the other. Aron, our masters taught us that you must hold the bible with both hands. With heart and mind. Alright, we'll hold the bible with two hands and we gonna shoot as well. Oh my... you talk like a true Polish Jew. You know the difference between God and a Polish Jew? -No... God knows everything... the Polish Jew knows everything, but better. Welcome back! It's so good to see you... Who put this here? -'Twas me. What for? Well, considering the situation I thought... What? Monika is right...the neighbors aren't trusty, we gotta be careful... Whatever you thought, you're wrong. Take it out now... come on. I hope you have a mezuzah somewhere. No, we don't have it. Of course we have it. Good. Here... you put it so that everyone can see it... this way. I'll hang it. Come help me with Roby. Stay with him, I'll get the milk. -Hi Roby! I missed you so much! I thought I wasn't gonna see you again. Anita... Roth is a good man and the work shouldn't be too hard... If you can use a Singer and work well, I'm sure he'll be pleased with you. My mom had a Singer. How much will she earn? Maybe 20 dollars a week. -Dollars? Dollars are the only weapon against the "sovietization" of Europe. Here we are. I'll pick you up later. Anita... come with me. See you later. Peace to you. -Peace to you. Again, many thanks. Good luck. Do you remember me? We met at the ball. Don't be afraid, you'll be safe with us. Milos... she's Anita, look after her. Hi. So... put on this and sit here. David will explain you everything. Hi. -Hi. I can sew and thread a needle, my mother taught me. Uncle Jacob got me this job as well. Are you happy? I'll be happier when I leave. For Palestine. Aren't you afraid? Uncle Jacob says there's war there... the English are blocking us and Arabs don't want us. I'm more afraid to stay... they don't like us here. Actually, I don't know how Palestine is like. Maybe it's just a dream... But you never forsake a dream, don't you think? -Yes... What will you do there? I'm gonna build school for orphans. Look... you turn it this way... Then lower the needle. Come on, I got a surprise for you. -What? If I tell you it's not a surprise. You wanna go? We can have a drink, if you like. -No... I wanna see the end. A Jewish barber was really mistaken for Hitler? -Movies are all fiction, don't you know? It seemed all so real to me... and to you? No... I'm like Monika, there's things I choose not to think about. How come you never talk about the past? Monika never even asked me how mom and dad died. Please, Anita... it's the past, forget it... You may need to forget, not me! I wanna remember everything... How can you live this way? -Fine! You wanna know how my girlfriend died? Her name was Ilona, she was only 18 yrs old... the Nazis burned her alive in her house.... We're leaving, it's late. Come back soon. -Yes, Sunday around 7.... I'll see you then. Anita... don't ever leave Roby alone. Don't worry, enjoy the thermal baths. -Bring back something nice! You know, Roby... when Anita left the camp she could barely remember how to eat. No "camp", no... don't say "camp"... Hey there... -Hey there... Not in front of Roby! He doesn't know... -Yes he does! Come here... -Don't touch me... You're mine, little girl. -He's watching us! Don't fight... -Don't touch... Don't touch me in front of the kid! He's just a kid, who cares... Why don't you play with him, he's your nephew. Don't you like kids? No, wait... kids are women's stuff... Come on... I go get lunch ready. You've got the toys, stay there. Anita! Come back here! I know you're not sleeping... Look what I brought you. Didn't you love chocolate? Maybe I'm wrong... too bad... I'll give 'em to someone else. I was right then... the Miss wasn't asleep... You like 'em? Eli... Do you love me? I wanna know. -You already know... No... I don't... Yes... Of course I love you. You'll wake the whole building... You can't do laundry this late in the night. Why are you crying? Did you like it? We're back! Here's my little prince... Mommy... My love! Mommy is back... Eli? Bring the luggage inside. Any presents for us? Wait... sit down... Camp... What did you tell him? Camp... What have I told you when you got here?? What?? -You don't tell such things to a baby! Let her go! -Answer me! What's going on?? Do you know how she looked after Roby while we were gone? Talking about the camps! -Is that true? How would I know? When she looks after the kid I'm always at work! I had told her to leave Auschwitz outside. Did you hear? It's alright... Zulejka... how's work going? Fine. Mr. Roth is a good man. -Yes. What's this? It's for you... Very kind of you, Zulejka. Nobody will talk to Roby about the camps... -Stop it now... she had enough. Also, the Purim is near... and I want everybody happy and in peace with each other. Alright... I'll help you sewing your dress. You know what Purim is? -Of course, it's the Jewish carnival. And king Achashverosh spoke... And said to queen Esther... Who is and where is him who dared behave this way? And Esther replied: "A hostile man, an enemy, this evil Haman!" Sing! What do the words mean? When the Rabbi sings, everyone sings... When the Rabbi dances, everyone dances... When the Rabbi drinks, everyone drinks... When the Rabbi laughs, everyone laughs. But when the Rabbi weeps... He weeps alone. Come on, one kiss... No... leave me alone... You're beautiful, you know? You were after Monika, I saw you. -You saw what? You think it's normal to kiss your sister-in-law? Everybody kisses everybody in the Purim... "Make love on the Purim night... and your future will shine bright..." You don't love me...you never did... -Yes I love you, loved you, love you.... You're drunk... Have a nice day. No kiss? Thanks for the help, the ships are coming to Marseilles... looks like everything's fine. Uncle Jacob... you don't need to worry. You know where they're taking him? -To Prague... and then to Marseilles. Lucky him. When is your birthday? -January 26, and yours? Mine is on April 12. -In the springtime... No chit-chat please... I was thinking... Isaac and Ismael were brothers, both being sons of Abraham... So? So why Jews and Arabs hate each other? They come from Ismael, us from Isaac... Same forefathers, aren't we brothers and sisters? Brothers and sisters can hate each other, especially if they have to share one land. Christians and Jews don't get along, and yet Jesus was Jewish. Wouldn't it be great if I could come with you in Palestine? But your family is here. My aunt can't stand me. -Why? I remind her of things she wants to forget. She survived, but the man who saved her didn't. Neither my mom and dad. But you did. That's why she's so uncomfortable with me. Why she makes you too feel uncomfortable? She never hugs me, never smiles at me, everything I do is wrong. I think you should be more concerned about Eli. -What makes you think that? I don't like the way he treats you. -He's not mean... He's like that cause they burned his girlfriend alive... we have to understand... You think he loves you? He says he does, when I ask him. -And what about you? Do you love him? Yes... I'm afraid I do... Milan! Milan, don't go! Good morning... -Good morning. Please, come in. So, can you play? -Yes... a little... Can I ask you a question? -Of course. Are you in love? Why do you ask? Well... I saw you kissing a boy. Yes... he's my boyfriend. I... I was.... I was wondering... how does it feel to be in love? It's hard to explain... The best way to answer you may be this... What is love? Is it like when you're freezing and suddenly you find a warm fire? Or maybe it's like a feather, so strong that leaves you breathless... Or it's such a wonderful thing that if you try to describe it, it gets angry and... ...loses all its wonder. He's late? As always... I'll take you home, if you want. Let's go. Do you ever wonder who are we? Our people, I mean. Here, we are nothing. Is that why you study Hebrew? My parents felt they were more Czech than Jewish, I wanna be just Jewish. You never told me what happened to your parents. My father was a scientist. He didn't wanna be deported. He took his own life. Along with my mother. They left me with a colleague of my father, above suspicion cause he was a fascist. Then they went back home and shot themselves in the head. I can't forgive them for that. That's why I wanna go as far as possible from here. Can't you hurry up? -No... first tell me where you wanna go. Stop asking, forget that carpet and come. There he comes. Do you know why I brought you back here? Someday we'll ride him... you and me. Ride him far away... Far from everything. You and me alone. Where to? Wherever he wants to take us, as long as it's far away. You really mean that? Of course I do. Of course I do... David...a wonderful thing... Eli loves me! Where's David? He's gone. Gone? Where? That I don't know. Where's David? -He went with Sarah. David's gone! -Sarah took him to Prague this morning. Prague? -The trucks for Marseilles leave from there. He left without saying goodbye...I saw him yesterday... he didn't tell me...he was gonna....leave.... Milos! Bring ammonia! Here... Shall I ever see him again? Of course you will... if you'll go to Jerusalem. Roby.... Anita feels a bit sad today... Her best friend went away. Luckily I got you to cheer me up. Is that right? What you're doing? No, Roby... I'm exhausted... Hey... you're shaking... What happened? Eli... I'm pregnant... Don't be silly... it can't be. Yes it is... If it's true that's your fault. -Mine? Don't you have something to do with it? I didn't get you pregnant! -No one else ever touched me, you know that! What do I know? Your word against mine. -You should be ashamed of yourself.... Keep your voice down...they can hear us. Listen... Tomorrow I'll take you to a doctor and if.... -If what? If you're pregnant... -If I'm pregnant? You gotta give it up. -I wanna keep it... But I don't. -You're a monster! It's our baby! Shut up! They're sleeping... You said you loved me, that's how you show it? I do love you and one day we'll have a baby... -Liar! But now it's impossible... -I wish God would make you mute... Try to understand... we're too young... See how you behave? You're still a little girl. How can you be a mother? See? There's nothing to worry about. The doctor said it's safe. And the doctor in Prague is an expert. Just say something... -I don't want the abortion. What? -I don't wanna! You're a... butcher. Say that again and I'll really hurt you! -Do what you want, I won't do it! Shut up! I'm sorry... I'm sorry...please, forgive me...Anita... I won't go to Prague. Yes you will. If you keep pushing me I'll tell everyone you got me pregnant. -Go ahead, do it...if you got the nerve. Eli... imagine if we had a beautiful child, like Roby... I'd be a great mom... I'd keep working, so that one day we'll have the money for our own house. Eli... The last thing I want is put a baby in this world. On Monday we go to Prague. Can you feel it's already moving? I wanna sleep now. David...since you left I have no one to talk to... I told Roby that without memory we are nothing... Of course he didn't understand and he laughed... If I can I will escape from this house... Prague... how beautiful it is.... I dreamed of coming here with you and dad... Instead I'm here with my executioner. What did you say? COME BACK SOON! MONIKA. Make yourself comfortable. Eli, please...let's leave...they're not Jewish here... -Shut up and sit down... you're making me nervous. Come with me, the doctor is waiting for you. Not you. Well, Anita... let's see how you're baby's doing. Here we go. Spread your legs, please. -Listen to the doctor... spread your legs. Like this... Stay relaxed... Like that... Good. Tell me... the girl agrees to the abortion? Yes or no? -Yes...she does. I got the money here. Fine... let's proceed then. The boy is out there waiting, but tell me the truth... do you love him? Yes or no? Now, I don't. Not anymore. Tell me one more thing... would you keep your baby? Yes...but Eli would not... So that's his name? Do you know what I think, Anita? I think Mr. Eli does not deserves you at all. Maria... get her ready, please. -Yes... Thank you. Now you gonna sleep, and when you'll wake up it's gonna be all over. Lean on me. See what a nice room I took? There's a balcony too. Go to bed...the doc said you gotta rest. -Don't pretend you're worried about me...I know you're not. Come on...come on... -Don't you touch me! I'll get you something to eat...what would you like? I'm not hungry. -Then go to bed and try to sleep...I'll go get cigarettes. Ok? Eli... -Yes? I don't blame you... you're just like that. What you're talking about? Eli... -I'll be right back. Eli! Open! Excuse me... I gotta go... -You could have hurt yourself...did your husband lock you inside? He's not my husband. -Anyway I'll charge him for the mattress. What shall I say to him when he comes back? -To not look for me. Then you better leave now. -Thanks... Do you know where is the Center for Jewish refugees? Down there...ask around. Excuse me, where is the Center for Jewish refugees? Thanks. I'm looking for Sarah. -She's inside. You go.... Anita, what you're doing in Prague? Help me. if Eli finds me he'll kill me... -Why? I escaped...I wanna follow David to Jerusalem... I can pay you...will you help me? Monika and Aron must be waiting for you... -They won't miss me...don't send me back there, please help me... It's not my decision...and the next truck is complete. The truth is I'm pregnant... Eli took me to Prague to have an abortion, but... -But... But then something happened.... I still can't believe it... So... did you sleep well? Maria, help her stand up and make her sit there, please. Stay there half an hour and then you can go. The important now is that the gentleman out there believes you had the abortion. Didn't you tell me you wanna keep the baby? Yes... but... I gave you a tranquilizer, so you gonna look sleepy to him. But the operation... What operation? There was no operation.... But we'll have him believe I did it... and that you feel sick.... Here... there's enough money to get very far away... Finally I see you smiling.... Have you decided the name? No....until a few minutes ago I didn't believe he'd ever be born... You'll have to think about it now... And hold on to these... I see you got your strength back... You gotta eat for two now. You know what my dream would be after reaching Palestine? -What? Writing.... Poems, novels, fables...I wanna create a world that doesn't exist. This one's not enough? Mine will be much better. -You can't live just writing... I'll scrub floors and clean bathrooms... and I'll write in the nighttime. You will help me go, right Sarah? I told you...it's not up to me. Excuse me. I'm looking for Anita...is she inside? No, she's not here. Can I take a look around? -No, you can't. If you see her, tell her that I ain't going back without her. I'm here... I'm waiting for you... I'm waiting.... come... Anita...you have to go. I was dreaming about David and my mother... She was so beautiful... Let's go... Please don't send me back home...please... Sarah, please no.... -Anita! Where are you going? Anita, stop! No, please...Sarah... let me stay here with you... Let me go...please... I thought you wanted to go to Jerusalem... Jerusalem? -Yes. Isn't this the trip you wanted to take? In a truck? How did you think you'll get to the ship? Flying like a butterfly? A seat became free...so, get up. Am I dreaming? Miriam..are we ghosts or flash and blood? -Ghosts...in flesh and blood.... Will you come to see us? -Of course I will. Dear Monika... Kiss Roby for me and tell him that Anita one day will come back... I'm happy cause I travel in peace towards the past with just one luggage... The future.
