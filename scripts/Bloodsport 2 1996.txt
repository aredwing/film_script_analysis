But there was a time that even the good... Was evil. BLOODSPORT II. Give me ten minutes. Do you like? Ming, fourteenth century... ...a piece of junk twentieth century. I do not think I know you. 'm Spill Killeman, by your business partner. I am David Leung, the master of this house. I do not recognize his name. I was invited here by Mr. Chien. You should remember. Oh, yes. Please, feel free. I hope you have fun. You can be sure, Mr. Luen. Leung. By the way, where is the original? Saved in a safe. A safe place. Fits in any corner. I see a drink. Do you speak English very well. When I have to talk... Oh, you have... The only language I know. Too bad, I think the most beautiful French. A man of the world. Just one of the things I like. And what is the other? Antiquities. Especially the Chinese. And I am very good with my hands. Could you give me license by one second, please? 're Leaving? No, I'll be right back. Okay ya. You are leaving? What is this? Only a sword old. Look, it may seem kind of silly I do not even know your name. You like to get out of here... And something to eat? We could have lunch tomorrow morning at the hotel? No, I can not. I do not awake so early. Like a rose. My name is Janine Elson. And yours? Alex Cardo. See you later. She said earlier, Alex. She can say what you want. We are here for the money. This is too big for him. He will not hold a curl. Who cares? Steal it is suicide. He has friends, has power. Fuck friends. Fuck power. Do not want to teach me how to make my business... . After sell the sword, enter holiday. You will pro inside with their relatives and I'll do my contacts in Europe. E disappear for a while. No contact. Alex? I know I broke the combined... ...but wanted to do the right thing, then popped... ...sooner. Ok Could be. Put?? your hands up. Come on. Let's get out of here. Listen to me, the thing will thicken if you come after me. You like this This is not your country. He was caught and treated like an animal. It was played in a very dark place. But master, you know a person so, so bad? Yes, he was my friend. How did you meet? In prison. Do not you afraid of jail? Yes. But the worst prison is one that construct for ourselves. Walk. Come on. You... Come... Come... Get away from him. Stopped. I'll keep an eye on you. They will kill you. I can take care of myself. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Want confusion? As I said, I can take care of me. That man is Chien and these people are protected by it. Well look at these faces. Oh, sorry. You're the boss, you are superior. He is back in prison. Oh, forgive me, please. See? Afora is not the answer. They can break you. The spirit is within you. This they can never break. The lock you gave yesterday... I have never seen anything like it. There is a lock. What would be a coup? There is a coup. ...The iron hand. A way of being. I do not understand. Note. Do not need to touch. To develop the iron hand should stick to peace and focus. Why do you have a particular cell? I'm here long. The guards respect me. Until that big guy. The Demon. He does not like me much, but I respect. Why stopped the fight yesterday? The man who infuriated... Chien, he's the boss of the cells. The guards allow solve their own problems. You are in a big trouble. What kind of problems I got myself into? Why are you in prison? I stole a sword old. What kind of sword? A espadajaponesa, spiked jewelry. Akatana? Alex? How do you know my name? That old man who tried to save? No one here would give a damn. But you gave. If you want to learn how to iron fist... I'll show you. How often should I do this? Until my feet are tired. Why are you here? What did you do? Killed a student? Yes. I came here from China, to teach some soldiers iron hand. One of my students, a soldier tried to rape a girl. Her brother tried to save her, and soldier killed him using the iron hand. They sent me to kick him but I had to kill him. His father was a politician put me here. That was '15 years ago. When going out? Never. My parents were missionaries lived a place to another. China, India, Philippines. You say that sword and I to theft. You do not seem to like this very life of a missionary kid. I was forced to go from one place to another. No friends, no roots. We came to Thailand when I was '16 years... I stayed. And why do you think is in prison? I'm here to steal... why. You are in prison for that you never forgave his parents. And you're a shameless thief. Why are you helping me? Tell me. 25 years ago, I competed the Kumite. Have you heard? No. The palavrajaponesa to fight. The most prestigious championship throughout the world... . Won or lost? That league has no weapons or awards or belts. Nothing but a ceremonial sword. A sword that someone stole... A sword, big deal. That tournament was... ...a chance to compete with the best in the world. It was a spiritual event. Then I'll tell you: I'm not spiritual. Why do you keep repeating this to yourself ? You denies this and is doomed to live with his empty... .... An eternal loser. Okay Look. Assuming even arrested, I can prepare myself. How do I get invited to this? Make earned. The superintendent wants to see you. ...Better go to him. Open this cell. I heard attacking a guard. It was a trap. They set me to fight Chen. What will they do to me? I do not know. Attacking a guard is serious. No, no. Stop. Remember: Inner Strength... I will be with you. Hear my heart beating. Then Alex came across his great challenge was: Accept your fate. How did this to him? Would use the iron hand, break the tables and run away from prison. We can not always run away from our problems... . We can not always fight. Need courage to face our problems. And be patient. When we start accepting is starting solutions. Let's see what happens. You will still train me? Calm down. Is useless while angry. In the cell... I could hear his voice all the time. Do not departed. I promised. I used to promise things for people, but they were all lies. The Kumite... I wanted to win it for you. It's not about winning. About find. I give you my word. I'll compete the Kumite. Let's not talk about the Kumite. Rest first. How's it going? In great shape. The superintendent wants to see you. What is happening? I want to know. But it does not seem too harsh. Okay Finish my game, I'll be right back. Now you'll lose, my friends. The super entendente? What did? He said I'm free. Someone out there must have helped you. Who? I do not know. I can not leave him alone. You should. The Kumite is to begin soon. Demon was summoned to the competition. And you know he is capable of anything. He is gone. You must stop it. Not by brute force, but with technical and inner strength you possess. Very important that you know what that means. Look at you. You look different today. Go back to the world clean. Do not forget that ever. Do the spirit of Kumite reign again. I will. promise you I will find a way to get you out. Be careful, now that we know what means a promise. I promise. Want to join? In his new freedom, Mr. Cardo. Mr.. Any idea why you're here? Revenge? At least the least profitable. If you take a look around you... 'll Understand better what kind of profit I prefer... . That item in particular that was My Lord and appropriated. Has a value beyond riches. A value in itself, a spirit life which was a symbol. The highest award that the greatest fighter in the world... ...might deserve. The Kumite? Is to start and not no prize to be given. You should find his former partner and make it up to you to bring a sword. This is the price for your freedom. Alex had the chance to fix what was wrong . Could be wrong again. Not afraid to trust him? Fear and trust are two very different things. Within us there is good and evil. If I were afraid of what he might do , maybe I only see evil. But if I trust him, then I would consider good. And that would allow him to help himself. What is your name? Alex Cardo. His invitation, please. I do not have one. So can not compete. Next, please. What is your name? Nago. Next, please. Call that a punch? What the hell, you can not fight in the Kumite. What are you talking about? I have an invitation, buddy. I do not really care. I can decide and say you can not. Who will stop me? You rascal? Bring me your invitation and I make you swallow it. So, what's your story? I have no invitation. Too bad, bro, you will lose the biggest fight of his life. Look, I have to compete. I promised someone I would. See that big guy? He's the guy. If anyone can help you, it is. Thank you. I made a promise to someone, and hope you can help me. Hey, come on, buddy. What do you want? Can we make a deal. Want an invite? Only detonate Mr. Cardo here. Are you ready? Come on. Thank you.

Sit down, please. Can I tell you something? Course. Know I should fight with you the semi-finals... I want to know... It's nothing personal. Is always personal. We should only make it honorable.

I'm not that Alex stole the sword from you. Now? That was Alex. I understand that, but that does not answer my question... . Why? I know what the sword means. And that's just understood. Do you understand the Kumite. But only that explains why to refuse my help? Enough justifies. Even if you die trying? Okay. Still do not understand, but I trust and respect your wishes.

I and you, soon. Just for me. Alex, Alex, Alex. Mr. Leung? Where did you get this? Alex said that Mr. Was waiting for this. He is a man of honor, my friend. It is not something I would tell a few years ago. There was a reward for her. The recompensaj was paid. I used my influence to bring its reward here tonight. Alex, Alex, Alex. Alex, are you okay? It is made of what? Stay there, stay there. I do not remember how long has it been since we saw... Demonstration of this technique, endurance and... ...correction. So it gives me great satisfaction gifting him with the sword of honor. The great champion of the Kumite. You earned it. And then, Alex won the Kumite and gave me a sword. So you can see that all of us... Terms good and evil within us. But before we go... What? I forgot something? He did not have to kiss the girl?
