Ye. l'll iust oet our baos. l want to hear that auestion. l had chanoed my mind. Thought l would take up the iob at your hotel in Dubai. But, since you've bouoht this hotel also... ...and your reputation means evemhino to you... ...it won't be right for me to even stay here. My son was iust 1 month old... ...when my husband left us. l've been waiting for him since 5 years. But yesterday... ...the police told me that... ...he's a member of a terrorist oroup. But l in't know about it. But now that l know. it scares me. This news might ruin my son's life. So l thought of taking up the iob in your Dubai hotel. Aarav. we'll oet stuck in traffic.

Mom, l've got fever. l was feelino cold. That's why l came inside. Where else could l oo? You know... ...l fled with you from the hospital when you were born. Because l didn't have the money to pay the bills. Your father didn't oive me a penny. He left nothino before leavino us. lt was really hard to find this iob. And l almost lost it all today because of you. lf that happened, what would we have done? Where would we stay? How woul we .uive? Who o we have in thi. worl? - Me. l've .ai it... ...Me. Hioher! Va.uha! Hi. Va.uha. You? Naila Naila Saar l work in the hotel's house-keepino depament. Nice meestino you. Shehzad, we need to oo to Miracle Garden first. - Okay. ma'am. Why? Why not the hotel? Well. our boss has already arrived ... ... and he's waitino there for you. - Good mornino. sir. Good mornino. Mr. Ruparel. Welcome to Dubai. Thank you. l know l'm a cruel man. When it comes to work, l spare no one. Not even myself. But the iob at hand is special. Come over here, l want to show you somethino. My Japanese desioners want me... ...to plan the garden of my new hotel like this one. But l'm a bit confu.e. Should l make an exact replica. or not. l mean, there are 40,OOO flowers here. It's stunnino. It's beautiful. But l still feel like Somethino is missino here. lt lacks somethino. Can you tell me what's missino? There are no rie leave. here. According to me, Mr. Ruparel, a oarden that doesn't have... ... a few dried leaves, some withered flowers. doesn't seem real. This place is too beautiful. And maybe that's why it doe.n't touch the hea. Evey beautiful thing ha. .ome flaw in it. Even the moon ha. crater.. But...why is this oarden so flawless? Amazino. You answered my auestion so easily. You surpassed my expes. You okay? Something went into my eye. - May l? Thank you. Naila. l need a sim card. l want to talk to my son. Please help me oet one. Mama, l'm here. - Saani! - l told you.

And this is the first time this place has seen lioht. But...how did you manage all thi. in .o little time? We did it tooether. sir. Otheise it would've not been possible. But the idea was yours. lf the light hadn't been in you, it wouldn't have reflected out here. No matter how many times l thank you for that. it won't be enouoh. This is dim in comparison to the lioht you've brouoht to my life. You chanoed my life. My son's too. l am a vey selfish man. l only do what makes me happy. But l would never want you to consider this a favor. Or feel burene. l really mean it. Goodbye. We'll miss our flioht. Aarav. Yeah. Take care. Va.uha. Can l click a picture of you? Just one snap.

So l can't sell this hotel to you. - Sory. Emotions and you. l don't see a speck of emotion on your uoly face? What do you mean. Mr. Ruparel? What's ooino on. Apooa? ls this a business meetino or... ...an insultino session? You're humiliating me in my hotel, in front of my people. - Think about my aoe. - l am a hea patient. Leave. Please leave.

You and your family will be beooino on the streets of Kolkata. This shock mioht... ...even cause a hea-attack and you'll die on the streets. Believe me... ...that'll make me really happy. - l just can't get Bose's reaction out of my head. ''What's ooino on. Apooa?''

You and my mother have a similar stoy. But after my father left us, .he fell in love with .omeone el.e. Jeevan Rane. He was madly in love with my mother. but... ...alcohol ruine him. He even lost his iob because of it. - But even in that painful povey... - ...we would find our moments of happiness. - We would get so happy when she would .teal food for me from that club. - An alcohol for Jeevan uncle. J - The world saw that as theft but to u. it wa. love. - And then one day that incident took place... - ...which completely shattered us. Wait. - What happened?

We need help. - That was the scariest nioht of my life. l saw a weak man get destroyed becau.e of hi. .hame. That nioht l swore to be successful... ...and took my first step towards becomino successful. But this success doesn't take away the pain. That pain still exists....even today. That day when l made you talk to your son... ...and saw the happiness on your face. l realized that pain reduces when you oive happiness... Sorrows reduce when you oive ioy. Vasudha, l want to make a deal with you. l want to give you all the happiness in the world... ...in exchanoe for your pain. Vasudha. it's your love... ...that made my hea see the lioht beyond my darkness. Thank you. l love you a lot. Vasudha. ''Now you're mine forever.'' Sir. Sir. sory to disturb you. sir. Va.uha. What i. thi.? ''Naila, by the time you wake up, l would've already left.'' ''Don't ask why.'' ''My condition is like the traveller wanderino in the dese...'' ''...that sees water, but it turns out to be a miraoe.'' ''Just a fioment of his imaoination.'' ''Last nioht l was deceived.'' ''So...l am leaving without informino the manaoement.'' ''Look after yourself. Naila.'' ''Thank you.'' Vasudha. where are you ooino? Away from you. Me...or my love? Why? Because you're mistaking your lust for love. What did you say? - Yes. Mr. Aarav Ruparel The world is like a toy shop for you. You can buy anythino you like. But l am not for .ale. You did all this to escape your lonely and borino life. An l wa. .uch a fool to think that... ...l had come here for my own needs. l am not some coin Iyino on the street. l belono to someone else. Do you get that? - No. l don't understand these bio talks. Vasudha. All l uner.tan i. thi.. You know me really well. don't you? Uner.tan me. But do you understand yourself? No. Vasudha. You love me too. A lot. But you will never say it. You will yearn for me, but never express it. You'll keep runnino from me. Wander in that dese in your hea. You want to come clo.er to me. Wrap your arms around me and cy, make a place in my hea! But you won't do it. But l'm not like you. l can't live without tellino you that l love you. That l need you. What coul hu me more... ...than knowing that life scares you more than death... ...love scares you. not loneliness. l can't fall in love. l can't feel anythino. Go away. You're wrono about me. l'll take you back to your home. But first l want to take you somewhere. Vasudha. After that you can make your decisions. A failed attempt to commit suicide... ...another failure. Jeevan uncle couldn't endure the brain trauma... ...and slipped into a coma. Doctors said he'll have to spend the rest of his life like this. He even told mom to take him off all his life-suppo systems... ...but mom didn't aoree. An l .till remember what .he .ai. She said ''Love is a responsibility...'' ''...and only the founate ones oet it.'' For the last 20 years, she has spent ... - ... hours here eveyday to hear hi. heabeat. She even says that Jeevan uncle... ...gives her marks for her piano peormance. - Sweet. isn't it? So how many marks did you oet today. ma? Aarav! Zero marks and it's all your fault. My hea was saying that you're somewhere close... ...and so l couldn't impress him. Who's this wandering soul that feels like a kindred spirit? Ma. l've brouoht her here today... ...so that you can defend my case. l want to oive her and her son... ...the life that you and l never had. Come. l want to mary her. oive her love. But .he oe.n't tru.t me. You can call this a plea. if you want. But the hea doesn't stop for eveyone. Even heabeat. have rule.. We're told the stoy of Sita from childhood. We're tauoht to be like her. But no one talk. about Raha. Whereas she's the one revered alono with Krishna. in evey home. So think about it. You won't oet this time back aoain. Life doesn't oive a second chance. Love's in front of you. Don't run from it. What oood will that do? Make you pious? Become Sita? But you've always been that.

But you're so engrossed in your pain... ...that you can't see me. Because if you could. Hari... ...you wouldn't have asked me to run away with you. And what's the point of runnino away. Hari?

She says her husband is innocent. He'. been frame. He didn't commit the crimes you're accusino him of. So let's oet to the point. You're the Home Mini.ter. Elections are iust around the corner. l'm sure you'll need donations. Name your price. You will get the money within the hour. Keep the money and release Hari. The fuher he stays from these political oames. the better. But. Mr. Ruparel. Hari isn't innocent. We have evidence aoainst him. Mr. Patil, you seem to be a sensible person. You can continue working for your depament... ...without becoming puppets for these politicians. So please...don't give them your shoulder to taroet this woman. Because this entire charade is only to stay in the headlines. You're absolutely rioht. l ordered Patil to arre.t her hu.band... ...and oive the news to the media. What to o? Election. are clo.e. l nee to be in the healine.. An another truth i.... ...her husband came to the Crime Branch today.. . ...and accepted his crimes.

So that he can stay away... ...and you can be happy with Mr. Ruparel. l .ee....o that'. the ca.e. l thouoht l was a lowly man. l was using her husband for my own benefit. But this is iust amazino. We're all the .ame. Rioht. Mr. Ruparel. A poor man's wife is eveyone's missus. Listen...take my advice. That obsession of love in your eyes... ...has ruined many kinos and emperors. So don't ruin yourself for these stupid emotions. Well...l'll foroet evemhino you said. What do they call it? Consider it a child's obstinacy. Do you understand? - You? Okay. l'm done talkino. Let's fight. - Aarav. Get ready to fight the biggest battle of your life. Deshmukh. Because l promise... l will oet Hari out... ...even with his sioned statement. No matter what means l use, rioht or wrono.. . ...he will come out. And you'll iust watch. Aarav. Iet's oo. Aarav. come. Vasudha. Iet's oo. Come. l want the best lanyer for this case. Robin Salve. He hanle Mehta'. ca.e. But we'll have to pay a huoe fee to oet him on this case. He doesn't like such anti-national ca.e.. Money is not the problem. Apooa. Just oet him. Lets oo. Eveyone's fiohtino because of me. Hari put the noose around his neck. You're prepared to fioht aoainst the world. And l'm just watching evemhino like a coward. With a hope that evemhino will be fine. But l'm one with thi. cowarice. l won't build my world on Hari's dead body. After hi. .acrifice.. l can never be happy with you... l have loved you a lot... ...an l can't o thi.. To build a heaven for myself ...l can't push you in this hell Sir... l did what you asked me to do. This hotel now belonos to you. l apologize for my inecent behavior. You were the owner of thi. hotel... ...and you always will be. - In lioht of all the evidence... - ...the cou finds Hari Prasad ouilty under section IPC 302... - ...and oives him the death sentence. - To be hanoed till death. Hari! Hari! Hari. why didn't you say somethino? Hari, tell them evemhing that happened in Bastar. Tell them about Father Peter Dayal. Hari. Hari. tell them the truth. Hari! Hello. - Mr. Ruparel. this is Robin Salve. ACP Patil wants to talk to you. l on't uner.tan. - Sir he wants to meet you. - He wants to see you. Help me? Why? Because even the universe helps true lovers.. . So l decided to make a small effo in tyino to unite Vasudha and you. Vasudha came to see Hari evey day... ...and pleaded with him to withdraw hi. .tatement. But Hari has been treating her like an animal. He .hunne all her effo.. l spoke to Hari after Vasudha left. Why admit to a crime you never committed? Why do you want to hano from the noose? Becau.e l on't have a choice. l want my wife back. She's mine. l will oet hanoed for her. An l know her well. Seeing my condition, she will never oo back to that man. He might be rich, but he can't buy her soul. l control her strinos. And l will control her all my life. Never let her oo. Centuries of values are imbibe in Va.uha. She won't live in peace. She will live in guilt that she betrayed me for the rest of her life. She will pay for her Iu.t with her hu.ban'. bloo. l will never let those two be tooether. That woman suffered for five years... ...and now she'll live on a false belief. that... ...her husband sacrificed him.elf for her. You can help her if you want, by provino Hari innocent. Although Deshmukh sir would never want thi. truth to be revealed. How? By ooino into the iunoles of Bastar. You will have to meet Father Peter Dayal. lf he gives a statement in Hari'. favor... ...then thi. ca.e will be over. And you'll have to do it soon. Because the cou has already oiven Hari a death sentence. You have to take hi. confe..ion... ...because the cou can never deny his statement. Do me a favor, cancel all my proorams. Make arrangements to oo see Father Peter. Take Vasudha's sionatures on the plea. We'll have to appeal for Hari in the hioher cou. But l don't understand the reason behind you ooino to that iunole. This county's laws don't work in those iunoles. Aarav. That place is riooed with explosives. That entire place is goddamn filled with land mines. Aarav. l'm sory. l'm not ooino to let you oo. man. We'll find someone else for this iob. l'm sory, l'm not ooino to let you oo. Didn't you hear what Patil said? No one .houl fin out about thi.. l'll have to oo personally. And remember. Apooa... ...l've to do this myself. l don't want anyone else on this iourney. l cannot risk anyone's life. Just make all the arranoements. So fini.h it off. What's the point of going the i.tance to commit .uicie? Have you seen the newspapers today? Our shares are fallino. you know that. And it also states that you're suppoino Hari.. . ...because you have an illicit affair with hi. wife. And that his kid may actually be yours. l want you to file a case aoainst this paper. l want this newspaper to shut down permanently. Who all are you going to fioht aoainst. Aarav? Ministers...newspapers...me? Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind? And now you want to walk through fire for the sake of your love. Why. Aarav? Why? lt took me a lifetime to uner.tan... ...that we can only love someone, when we stop lovino ourselves. Life is not like a business, where it's iust oive and take. l iust want to oive now. So don't fioht with me please. And make arranoements for my iourney. On one conition. l'm comino with you too. Even l have the rioht to oive love. l'm comino with you. Make .ure all the .tuff i. over there. Yes. sir. Sir, all the arrangements have been mae. All of it? - Yes. sir. l'll follow it up. - Yeah. - Okay. Aarav. l'll see you in the car. Yeah. - Okay sir. Eveyone. please. What are you doino? l ha hear... ...that God comes to eah in human form... ...to help someone. l've seen it today. Thank you. l should be thankino you. l wa. a .hattere man... ...who was tying to complete myself with money. Then you entered my life... ..and made me whole aoain. l had many addresses... ...but not a home. You gave me a home... in your hea. Thank you for giving this wandering traveller a refuoe in your hea. Can l take a picture of you? - Listen. do you know him? - Father Peter Dayal. That'. him. - My name is Peter Dayal. l declare that Mr. Hari Pra.ad i. an innocent man. - Well done. Aarav. - With this confessional video, we can easily put a stay on the sentence. He'll be out of iail soon. He'll be a free man soon. Aarav. Send it to me right away. - Ye. - The entire village will bear witne.. to thi.. Aarav. send it. - l iust don't oet you. Aarav. What you did today will set Hari free. And you will lose Va.udha forever. But you're still happy. A true love stoy has no end. Apooa. There's a voice in my hea which says that.. . ...even the entire universe cannot separate us. We're meant to be tooether. Ju.t watch... ...one day we'll be tooether aoain. l don't oet you. man. Apooa...stop the car. What happened? - Stop the car please. What happened? That fraorance. We'll be there in... 2 hour. from now. Yeah. l'll call you back. Aarav! - Va.uha! - Va.uha... Aarav! - There'. been an incient! Vasudha. Aaras no more. l knew Aarav. He would've wanted this crowd to live for Ruparel.. . - ...and our focus to return to our work. which he loved so much. With that spirit, we want to get the entire company tooether.. ..to celebrate his eraordinay life. And his various accomplishments. He trie to break an eternal bon. lt's oood that he's dead. God exists. Patil sir. He exi.t.. No. Hari. A Go that make. true love lo.e... ...ties a pious woman to a fraud like you forever... ...makes her your prisoner... ...only you can believe in such a God. Because the God l believe in will punish you. He will free Vasudha from your clutches. Now oo... ...your empty house is waitino for you. - Va.uha! Va.uha! You? Where'. Va.uha? Gone. She left. She's oone and left somethino for you. Go. take a look. Look! - ''l was shocked to see that nuptial necklace.'' - ''l couldn't understand how the meek woman l had branded...'' - ''...with my name, could actually leave me.'' - ''How did she muster such couraoe?'' - ''This thouoht drove me crazy.'' - ''And just like a parched man .et. out to look for a well...'' - ''...l .et out to fin her.'' - ''And after 2 years of searchino...'' - ''...l found her on the streets of Kolkata durino the Duroa Festival...'' Gloy to... Goddess Duroa! Saani. This is your father. He'. come to meet u.. Take his blessinos and oo out. We need to talk in private. Saani... Go out. Stop this charade. That's enouoh. Remember thi.? Or did you foroet it like your past? Remember? Ye... l've forootten all about it. Why did you brino it alono? To tie me? How will you tie me. Hari? With ritual. an traition.? Value.? Or with the charade of your fake sacrifice? No, Hari. These thinos can't tie me down now. And how will you foroet this? You can hide it under your sleeve, but how will you foroet it? How? This body is mine! Thi. breath i. mine! You're mine for oenerations to come. You think you can change that after sleepino with someone else? You're my Vasudha. You're my Vasudha! He touched you. didn't he? Where? Where did he touch you? Did he touch you here? Did you enioy it? You had fun. didn't you? So you've shown your true colors. Revealed who you truly are. Wear thi.. Wear this or l will kill you! Kill me. That's what men like you have done to women like me. You either kille u. in the womb... ...or rioht after bih. What stranoe tradition is this? Evemhino belonos to you. l've to wear your vermillion on my forehead. Your nuptial necklace around my neck. My wrists and your banoles.

Kill me. Hari. Kill me. Because l'm speakino out after aoes. l can't stop now. Silence me. Because l can no longer live caoed by your dead customs. Have you seen the lioht of love? l did. Hari. When Aarav touched my soul. That light...gave rise to a new feelino inside me. Maybe that's why he came into my life. All of us enter each othe. live. for a rea.on.
