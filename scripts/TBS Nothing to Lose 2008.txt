I said to the kids I'm going to screw your mother now so you can see that she is a hooker. So I take her to the bedroom and throw her on the bed... I said come on, take those panties off... I said be quiet, I got such a headache from those kids. You're not allowed to do that with kids of course. Ok, thank you Johan Johan? -hm? What? Do I.. Do I really have to do that? Come on.. Well I uh, I am Johan van der Sterre I murdered someone I understand I shouldn't have done that and I regret it You may not take another persons life. Is that good? Murdered someone? Yeah, my father And how did you murder your father? -Yeah, come on I... How, Johan? With a hammer. First on his forehead, and then on the back of his head, two times on his right cheek Then I crushed his right knee and his shoulder, and after that as often in his face until he didnt move anymore. Why were you so angry with him? Because of Sharon. -Your sister? Look, that he touched me, you know that was that, but I couldn't let him have his way with her, could I? Tell a bit more about your sister, did she still live at that moment in time? I've said it so often, that was not my fault, dad did that. I couldn't save her. I'm not trying to say what I did was right. I understand I should've reacted differently. I've been doing this for six years now.. The 23rd I have to go in court again, the only thing that I want is to proof that I learned from my mistakes. And that I can function normally in society, but I can't do that here, I can't proof it here. Your lawyer has said that he is going to ask termination, but Johan, our advise to the court on but Johan, our advise to the court on that is sadly negative After all that time you don't see clear enough what you did As long as you keep on blaming your father for the death of your sister, we find the risk is too big. So I have to lie to get out of here? We've tried to take the past in account, but it has to end somewhere, Johan. The judge gave you three tries, we won't take you longer than six years. Yeah.. so what then? Our advise to the court is the long-stay department. I have to speak to my lawyer, this is... See, Johan, formally speaking your case is reconsidered every two years, but no one has ever come out of long-stay yet. In fact this means life imprisonment. It is as simple as that I talked to your mother, explained the situation to her, but she hasnt responded Well, she has to come, you have to summon her. -The court can't force her to. Your mother did not want to come either And you can't see her yourself, because your request for short leave has been denied Do I have to read it for you? -No. So, Johan, and I know it is a sensible issue, but if I were you, I would start thinking about a partial confession. No, I am not going to lie about something like this. My mother won't let me stay in here, truly. Hey mom, it's me, my case is on the 23rd of September at 11:30 You only have to say what dad did to us. It is really important, mom. And I can see you are ashamed of what happened and I know you are upset with me But you really have to help me now, mom. Well, call me if you want to, or call my lawyer. Alright, bye. Ready? -No, hold on, I might receive a call. The court decides a resumption of criminal provision and extends the measure The convicted will be transferred as soon as possible to a long-stay clinic. Your lawyer will get a note of the verdict, the case is hereby closed. There you go. -Thank you. And one for Johan. Did we all sleep well, guys? There you go, one for Henk. Good, I want you to look... We're going to take a little walk. Don't be afraid. DON'T BE AFRAID. I don't like that. Hey dickhead, on your knees. Yeah go sit on your knees. I'm going to cut your throat if you're scared! You shave your vagina, right? I knew it! Open the door! I'm going to cut her! Johan, we have to go back. It's the best thing to do, you know it, right? Can you help me for a moment? Come out of the car! Mom? Easy Johan, It'll be over soon. Don't cry, Johan. Don't cry, Johan. Think of nice things! You're a good kid. Daddy's good kid. Hey ladies, do you need ride? We can catch the bus if we hurry. Can I maybe sleep at your place? -Why? Just, for fun. -What about your mother? Fuck her. Hey, where do you need to go? -We'll take the bus. Police, put away the gun! You, slowly walk to the door. Come on! Open it. Everything will be ok. I'm going to count to three, and we will both get in. One, two ... three. Put your seatbelt on. Put your safety belt on. Shit. God dammed. What is your name? Tessa. -What? Tessa. -Tessa, pretty name. I'm Johan. How old are you? Listen, this all looks a lot worse than it is. I am maybe even more scared than you are. I'm gonna drop you off where I picked you up, alright? Do you have a cell phone? Can I maybe use it? Yeah? -I'm going to keep it short, I don't want them to trace me. I have a hostage, a girl. -Jesus, Johan, you have to let her go. No, I have to talk to my mother. -Johan, listen to me, they found that therapist. She is raped and murdered. I didn't do that. -Then it is even more vital to turn yourself in. Don't make it worse than it already is. -Worse than it is? I'm going to let her go after I talk to my mother. Are you going to take care of that or not? No, I can't make that happen. I don't know where she is. When can I go home? I have to talk to someone. After that I will let you go. Come on, get out. You'll have to go in here. Yeah, sorry, but I have to make sure you're not going anywhere But I will suffocate. -No, not that fast, I will be right back. Watch your head. I will be right back, truly. Hi grandma. When did you get out? Do you have something to eat? Yes. Yeah. Where is mother? -I don't know that. truly. She left. Where to? I don't know. Grandma.. Where is she? I can't tell you that. Come out.

The best route is through Luik, here. -Where did you learn to read a map like that? My father taught me. Do you have a nice father? He's dead. For how long? Since I was 10. I found him myself. He was all blue. My mother said he drank himself to death. And now you live with your mother? Yes, and her new boyfriend. Ok, and from now on follow Lige. -Liege? Didn't we have to go through Luik? Yeah, that is called Lige in French. Who do we have to talk to in Belgium? My mother. Why don't you just call her? Because she doesn't want to talk to me. Why not? Because she blames me of everything. Of what? It doesn't matter, it is all nonsense. Really. Yeah, and now? -It should be somewhere around here. Somewhere. -It's not addressed too good. What? -Nothing. If you can do a better job.. -I didn't say anything! Take a left. I think we'll have to ask someone. Do you speak French? -Un petit peut. Ask there. We're close. Hand me the map.

You're going to make something happen? Yeah, I'm going to try to get you back safe. Go away! Go away! You have to undress. No. Else you'll get a cold. Is it true? What? Did you kill your sister? No. Truly. I swear it. And the other girls? Which other girls? -Your mother was talking about other girls. Tessa, my mother was crazy. It was my dad. Really. He should have never touched my sister. And now? We're going back to The Netherlands and... and I'll let you go. Really? And what about you? I'll see. We're going to need a new car anyway. They've seen this one. Pick one. Choose. The right one is the gas, and next to it the brakes yeahh? Those you have to control with your right foot. And left is the clutch, you control it with your left foot. And the handbrake. There, let the clutch go real slow and hit the gas a bit. Go sit up straight. You are handsome, you shouldn't hide that. I am not handsome. I have weird large nostrils. And I have braces, weird gums, my feet are too big, my thighs are too thick, and the rest of my body is too thin. People think I have anorexia. Look, Chantal is handsome, I always get all the losers. Nah, Chantal is maybe pretty, but you are handsome. Now go sit up straight. You shouldn't hide your face like that. That's a shame. Do you really think I'm handsome? Yes. Are you falling for me? We have to go When I grow up, I'll be a movie star and I'll marry a musician that is a drug-addict. So I can save him. Like Kate Moss and Pete Doherty, but he has to be more handsome. Pete who?
