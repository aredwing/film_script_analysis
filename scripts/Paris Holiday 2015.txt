Though the landlord agrees to end the lease early... you'd reimburse him for his loss, if he fails to lease it for the same rent. If you don't mind, may I ask why you move after a few months? Cut loss. Cut loss? Anything else? I got to go. Oh, Mr. Lam? Your cigarettes... Ditch them. I'm quitting. Mr. Lam, Mr. Chow asked you to take this gift to someone in Paris. And he asked this guy to find you an apartment there. Do you go to Paris often? Never been there. My first time. Hey! Wrong way! How could it be Louvre again? I'm sure it's the right way. I'm the best taxi driver in Paris. Trust me. You'll be there, sooner or later. Trust you? Why don't you tell me there're 2 Louvres in France? (Paris Holiday: Day 1) It's here. This is the address. Thank you. 200 Euros. What? Yeah, 200 Euros. Thank you. Bye. See you next month. Thank you. Thank you. Good day Sir. May I help you? You're from Hong Kong? Is Michael Lau here? Yes. You're here for Chung? He's out delivering flowers. Nice to meet you. I'm Amy. Why don't you take a seat? There he is. This is yours. Chung, he's looking for you. Michael Lau? You're... Mr. Lam? "You speak Cantonese? Nice to meet you. I'm from Hong Kong too. Call me Michael. Sorry, I'm late. Got tied up in traffic. That's ok. You know, Paris is gridlocked everyday. I'll get the key and show you the apartment. That's good. OK Thanks Dear darling! It's for dinner tonight. All my money is yours, honey! Will be right back. The apartment is just a few blocks away. You don't mind walking there, right? No, I don't, as long as we don't catch a cab. This way. Mr. Chow called a few days ago... asking me to find you a flat. There happened to be a vacant one... near your red wine company. Is it your apartment? I wish! I've been renting since I came 19 years ago. Many Chinese bought houses here, they asked me to manage them and collect rent. See? European ambiance. A refuge in the middle of all actions. You'll love it. Why don't you take the elevator? Young man, there's an elevator doesn't mean you should use it. The elevators in Paris are older than you and me. They're unreliable and dangerous. Melanie You look gorgeous today! This Italian nanny lives right across the hall from you. She collects garbage and her house stinks. Try your luck if you want. I've been trapped in it 3 times. Wait! Michael, a garbage nanny... a broken elevator... Any other surprise for me upstairs? Not the building. But...a little something about your flat. A little what? The former tenants haven't finished moving out yet. Not yet? They left a clutter? Something like that... The male tenant is gone, but the female still hasn't moved. Are you kidding? How could that be possible? Why not? 2 big bedrooms, one for you, one for her. Come on. Just take a look first. No! Just find me another one. Come on, keep going. 2 more floors. Almost there. What the hell? So ridiculous! Keep up! You're reaching the top! So easy! You really made it! Actually... What's new? Don't tell me there's a corpse inside. Not yet. Actually what Mr. Chow pays isn't enough to get you a flat... in this classy neighbourhood. But no worries! We Chinese will always help each others. You know what we Chinese are most capable of? Being flexible in different situations... Cut it out! Just tell me the truth. The woman was just dumped by her fiance. She's heartbroken. Double loss. No love. No marriage. For the time being, she lost faith in all men and hate them to bits. For her mental well-being and your safety... Enough. Forget it. I'll take the elevator! No...Listen... Let me finish. I called her yesterday... and told her you're not a man. What? I mean, you're not an ordinary guy. What's not ordinary about me? Do I fly? I told her and said you're... 9335--... And she's fine with it. What's fine about that? I'm not fine. You don't joke with things like that. Just act like one. Not for real. I have to be responsible to the landlord. Just help me out. So I'm here to evict the tenant for you? Don't put it that way. You climbed hardly 5 flights of stairs. You owe me that! Sit down and get rest for a tea break... and look around. OK? Your room is over here... This way. It's ginormous like a warehouse, right? Yes it does. It works better for junk than for people. No worries. No worries. 1 bathroom with 2 doors? So inconvenient to share a bathroom! This lock is jammed? Holy molly! It takes forever to tidy up this messy place. Take your time after you move in. Or, throw them on the roof. The kitchen has a back door, there're stairs going up. Later on, ask your friends over for barbecue, moon-bathing with a glass of red wine... Fantastic! I don't have friends in Paris. French girls are open to making friends. They'd go with you after 1 glass of wine, keep you up all night after 2 glasses. How about 3 glasses? Who are you? He's the...new tenant. I'm gay. Totally gay- Don't bring any man home. Thank you. You're in. I got to go. I have another appointment. Another flat? Why don't you take me with you? Out of 20 districts. Way too far. And you have to share a room with a black guy. I'm afraid you'd turn real gay. Please help me. Keep an eye on that girl. Don't let her hurt herself. Bye . (3 days later) Thank you. Where's Michael Lau? Where's Michael Lau? He's out delivering flowers. What's up? That woman... she's nuts. Not just a little neurotic, but a total psychopath. Xiao-min? You got what I'm saying? I have to move! I must move! Just tell me what happened. Calm down. Tell me. (3 days before) What the hell? What's that smell? Holly shit! You scared me! How'd you walking like a ghost? You really stink! Why are you touching my stuff? You... Your house is a mess. I love cleanliness. I can't live here without cleaning up. You're so stinky. When did you last take a bath? Your Putonghua sucks. Just speak Cantonese. My painting teacher was from Hong Kong. I understand Cantonese. I said, your house is a mess... Wait! How's your French? Not a single word I know. Why are you here if you don't speak French? I'm here to work. Not to spend my whole life here. Go away. Just go! Crazy bitch! Next time if you really need to show up behind someone, can you say something first? You scared me to death! Why hasn't you gone? Why should I go? I paid rent for living here. Wait. You have money? Can you lend me some? I haven't eaten for 2 days... Hey stop it. I'll get it. You stink. Can you take a bath first? Keep an eye on that girl. Don't let her hurt herself. Open the door... Can you hear me? Silent! Can I use your phone? I'll call the Police if you don't shut up! Open the door... So you waited by the door the whole night? Almost! What're doing out here, creep? Me? A creep? I knocked the door so hard for hours, I yelled like hell and you couldn't hear me? Are you toying with me? I was in the bathroom and didn't hear anything. Why didn't you ring the doorbell? I did. It didn't Work! Since when? Did you break it? I'm not talking to you. I'm going to bed. Wait... You went out without your keys. Where did you go? Oh I see... You sleepwalked? I went for a jogging. OK? Take your keys with you when you go out. Like me. You're not a kid. It's tired to teach you everything. Lock you out. See what your keys can do? Why are you scaring me again at midnight? Who are you? Why are you here? I'm the new tenant. I remember. You're that... Slay! Yes, I'm very gay... absolutely! Remember! Don't bring any woman... ...man home! How dare I bring anyone? Good night I can't hold in anymore! Did you pass out? I'm in a hurry to work! When did you come in? What did you see? Nothing spectacular! You are so gross! You peed in the sink? Poor personal hygiene! If you're not holding up the bathroom all morning, I wouldn't pee here! I'm in a rush! Missy! Well, I can't use this kitchen anyway. You'd better clean it with the strongest cleanser today! Or else, you'll have to pee here from now on. You eat out of the toilet bowl then. Stinky man! So gross! These are my clothes... These are mine... The woman upstairs gave me! How did you get them? Don't burn it! These are my clothes! Are you insane? I'm burning everything that's his. Those are yours. These are mine. You're so wrong! What's wrong with me? Tell me, what did I do wrong? I did nothing wrong! Tell me, what did I do wrong? What did I do wrong? Hui Hui You're back at last. Don't be mad at me. I don't need getting married. Everything stays the same old, we're so happy. Hui... Are you hungry? Don't leave me, I'd do whatever you say. Really? You'd do whatever I say? Good! Go back to your bedroom and sleep. Should we get married tomorrow? Yes, of course! Set the alarm and get up at 6 Take a bath, wash your hair. Clean yourself very well. Then we'd get married. Good. Go back to your room. See you tomorrow. See you. Bye. See you tomorrow. Bye . Xiao-min used to be gentle and intelligent. It's sad to see her like this, so pitiful. You'd be tolerate. Just bite the bullet and it's over. Tolerate? She pulls a different prank every day. Mr. Lam! Is this the new car you rented? Awesome. When can I borrow it for a ride? I want to move. Find me another flat asap. No, no, no. Mr. Lam. Listen. Now, you move, then you're breaking the contract unilaterally. Those 3 months of rent and deposit will be forfeited. That's all you're telling me? What else can I say? Say it in French? Chung I'll pack my stuff and go. Be it a hotel or a street. I won't live there anymore. You'd be fined for street-sleeping in Paris! My cell phone? What're you doing? You don't have to kill yourself for a breakup. L--- Don't move. Calm down. You calm down first. Leave me alone! Calm down. I'm getting my painting back! The wind will blow it away. Sorry. Give it to me. Look! This is the negative space here. This is Hui. Does it look like it? I don't know anything about art Hui is a very talented artist, 5 yrs ago, Hui and I got recommended by our school... to study in Paris University of Fine Ads (Beijing University of Fine Ads) Though we only had limited savings... it felt great to study and live abroad... with the love of our lives. (Paris University of Fine Ads) I studied painting, he studied sculpture. The first year was the happiest time of our life. Hui prefers abstraction. It's hard for him to earn recognition against mainstream, but I believed he'll be a brilliant sculptor one day. The cost of living in Paris was too high. So, I took a year off to work full time... before my final year. If there could only be... one artist between the two of us, I want it to be Hui. He promised, after graduation, he'd apply for residence permit as a freelance artist... and put on a solo exhibition as required. Then he'd marry me. 3 months ago, Hui opened his solo exhibition. It wasn't a huge one, but his works were commended by a famous gallery owner... who invited him for a bigger show. Hui was famous overnight! This is the piece I love most, dedicated to the most important person... in my life. This... This goddess is you. The negative space is me. We'll bond together... forever and ever. We started planning our wedding... after the exhibition as planned. But, Hui turned less and less interested, like a different person altogether. One day he took me back to university. He said, even we're holding hands, revisiting our romantic dating spots, he'd felt nothing. He had no feelings for me anymore... and feelings are indispensable to a artist. He broke up with me... because he needed new romance and passion... to fuel his creativity. He left the place we spent 5 years together... without turning back. I've tried my best... and worked hard for our future. And before I realized... the man I loved was already gone. I used to love his artistic temperament most. Finally, it's his artistic temperament... that hurt me most. Most artists are crazy. Look at yourself. How artistic! Though I felt heartbroken after the breakup, I haven't even shed a tear. It's important to learn to enjoy hardship in life. In the most painful time, give yourself a vacation. Take a break first. Let me enjoy the pain for a while longer then. No. No. No. I thought you don't want these. I keep it for you. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. You know how to fix a doorbell? Really? And changing a lock too? And this too? You're horrible! Not as horrifying as you. Lend me money. No. You don't have it? Yes I do. But I won't lend you any. I'll take it myself... No means no! You'd just spend it on cigarettes, alcohol and pizzas. You dump the pizzas after a few bites. How wasteful! I bought you drinks... and will make all your meals. But money? No way! Eat this first. Will let you know when dinner's ready. I'm not eating anything you make. Save the trouble! Hello? I'm coming back. Tell her don't leave there. Just keep her waiting for me. (Breakfast 5 Euros) Relationships must end if they don't mean to last. People you can't hold on to must be forgotten one day. There's no pain that lasts forever. Time will heal even the deepest pain. That badass chick is here again... Nicole? You're the new guy Lam? Stamp here. I'm in a rush. Boss, I told her not to smoke here, but she won't listen. It's OK. Come. Let's talk inside. You couldn't find a job last year or didn't care to work? You couldn't even make minimum wage for tax paying. Take a seat. I won't chitchat with you. Just stamp and sign the form. It's due today. I work for your dad, you don't pay me. Lose that attitude or show yourself the way out. The company will stop being your indemnifier this year. If you can't pay enough tax, you can't stay here. Pack your suitcases and go back to HK. Are you messing with me? Here. Your birthday gift from your dad. 2,000 Euros too, take it. Are you not stamping it if I don't take them? You're a jerk just like my bastard father! Cigarettes are expensive in France. Take it. Your tyres are all worn out. Time to get new ones. She hasn't taken any gift all these years anyway. It takes 7 years... for the body to replace all cells. Not one old cell is left. All the sorrows will be totally forgotten. Betrayal alone doesn't hurt It hurts because you care too much. Breakup alone doesn't hurt It hurts because you cling onto your memories. You are the only person who can truly hurt yourself. To love passionately... is no better than to break up decisively. Life isn't about mourning for the past, but looking forward to the brighter future. You have it, doesn't mean it'd last forever. You lost it, doesn't mean you won't own it again. Learn to smile in times of sorrow. Learn to live at ease by letting go. Bon appetite. Tastes good? So-so Breaking up... Shut up! Then you stop eating! Breakup... hurts so much... because your effort doesn't pay off. Just like running a business, making a total loss. Sure you'd feel heartbreaking pain. I did put all my savings on the wedding prep. So, to minimize your suffering, it's time for you to...cut loss! Chop off! Chop what off? Let's calculate your asset after dinner. You did put your head and soul for the wedding prep. No wonder it hurts so much. Banquet, wedding dress, honeymoon air tickets... I had to pay 50% deposit to have 20% discount. 8 tables of banquet? I paid for 4. No refund. No refund? Let's eat them all. Or sell them cheaply. To move on after breakup, step 1... get rid of anything that brings back the memories. Sell them if possible and ditch the rest. Get as much money back as you can. Cut loss. Preserve principal. How do I sell them? In a flea market? Online. "Wedding blown-off big sale"? Do you have to be so blunt? In the cyber world, the more pathetic gains more sympathy. This crystal glass is expensive. How can you sell at that price? Sell it. This bouquet was tailor-made... one of a kind. Save it as my souvenir please. Sell it. This pair of teddy bears are my favourite. Sell it. Sell them and you won't like them. Sell them and you won't be reminded. Sell... Got any sold yet? No! No one wants any of them. You're insane! Your business fails and you're happy? Bye None of your business. Just go. Lam Chum-KW.! Lam Chum-k... Yelling for that? People bought my stuff, a lot of them... Isn't that great? People want your junk. Are they all gone? About half of them... I don't want to sell them now. Buy them back for me. Do you have money? No. Well, at least your mind is clear. Turn off the computer and go to bed. You'd get paid after sending them out tomorrow. OK? Sleep! Go to bed now! (All posted items were sold) These candle stands... Put them down! Put them down! Stand away. Don't hang on to things not meant to be yours. No hard feeling. You don't understand. You'll never understand. Congratulations. You finally get money for food. No need to borrow money, especially from me. You can even pay me back what you owe me. Wait... You haven't paid me for all those meals I made. 5 Euros for breakfast, and for the dinner... 10 Euros? OK? How could you... Wait! There's no free things in the world. You need to pay me today's gas, labour and delivery expenses too... So that comes to... You ruthless jerk! You cold-blooded swindler! Stop whining. Give you 5 more Euros. How could you treat me like this? That's all? Have you got more stuff to sell? You crook! Douchebag! What're you doing? Get up! I don't need breakfast today... You're dreaming. Not for breakfast. Renovation! To move on after breakup, step 2 is... "a change of scenery". It's best that you move. But if that's not possible, at least give the house a makeover, so that you won't be saddened by memories. It's the ball Hui painted. I've been looking for it. Ditch it. It's the scarf I gave Hui. Ditch it. No, not this one... It's a Christmas gift from Hui, he told me to hung it by my bedpost for... Throw it. These pants... Throw them! They're yours. We have a rainbow in our sitting room. Cute, huh? You'd sleep here from now on. New place. New life. Congrats on your new home. Cheers. How come there's no label on this bottle? This is a new product from my company. I'm still thinking about the packaging label. It's you who need packaging. You wear the same ugly clothes every day. Come on. It's Paris! Only con artists are dressed like that. My clothes are expensive. And your hair... So sucks! How about this? I'll be your stylist from tomorrow on. But you have to pay me. (4 tables of banquet are successfully sold separately) Let me recap once more. The Chinese are here for a blind date. The British are here to mourn for the dead. The Indian are... The Indian for birthday. The French for baby shower. Mr Lam. I agree to let you host 4 tables of banquet... but not 4 separate tables of different food and people. How could it be possible? Hey waiter. Where's our wine? Hurry up! You both must help with the service. What the hell! John, he will always be in our heads. Joyful suckling pig! Sorry. .- You stupid Pig! Dessert first... Come on! Eat up! Mr Lam, where's the curry? We need all food with the curry. Curry suckling pig. Yes! Curry shark's fin. Ding Ding, get me some diapers. You two are made for each other. Not enough. You must be the bride and the groom. It's my dad who's having a blind date with her. Curry...curry... Sorry! I'll drink a glass as to apologize. Happy Birthday... Sorry... Wrong table again! Happy Birthday to you! Oh!I'm so sorry, I drink. To John! To John... Boss, have you got any diaper? Take a picture for successful blind date. I'll go grab some diapers. Will be back soon. Keep the 4 parties entertained. Johnny, you're great! Good to see you! This is Johnny. This is Lisa. Thank you. Mr. Lam. My condolences... Happy birthday... Bye... You made 1,000 Euros tonight. It doesn't cover your cost, but it's better than nothing. People say meeting your soulmate is the happiest fortune in life. So-mei? You mean the coral fish? Spiritual companion. I thought I found him. Don't give up. If you believe in fate, at the right timing... you'll meet him finally. Is this for me? Quite good! Not done yet. By an unemployed painter... this standard is really not bad. Of course. Come on. With your tiny bit of talent left, get over your trauma. Don't ruin yourself. Who cares about talent? There're talented people everywhere. You can have it if you want. Thanks. 50 Euros. You want money? Good. Get up and get dressed. Come. I haven't been sketching forever... Don't worry! If you draw badly, people just won't pay. Just draw a face like human, that's enough! Come on. Sit down. Drop that bag. Stay here. I'll get you some customers. Here comes the deal. Start drawing. She's too fat. What? Too fat! This one isn't fat, OK? What now? Too shod! Too HEW'-! She's not fat, ugly or shod. Would you start now? No... Are you from Mars or the Jurassic? You think you're Picasso? 100 Euros for a sketch? Why don't you rob the bank? You don't draw as quickly... or as nicely as others. How dare you to pick customers? You're wasting the oxygen on earth with that attitude. If you don't make any money today, I won't make meals for you. Our sisterhood is over! OK... I'll draw whoever for whatever price, OK? 10 Euros? Too low! Stop whining! Or just 1 Euro! OK, I'll sacrifice myself... to be your first customer. Go ahead and draw! More handsome. OK? 10 Euros... Very cheap. Cheap...come... Very cheap! Nicole, do you know that man over there? He's been staring at you all the time. How did you find me? I just passed by. You don't think I'm stalking you, right? Legally speaking, you're my employee, I have the right to know what kind of side-job you have. Bastard! I knew this swear word by Day 3 in Paris. Shut up! Or, I'd curse you with 100 swear words! You've been here for 15 years... and all you've learnt are smoking, swearing, getting tattoos, dyeing hair and speeding? No matter how badly your dad treated your mom, you don't have to ruin your own life. Did he tell you the whole story? My mom died 8 years ago, he said he was too busy... to show his face at the funeral. You want me to call that jerk dad? Tell him to screw himself! Mr Chow told me all this in detail. But you said it with more passion... while he said it with more guilt. If he doesn't care about you, he wouldn't have bought this wine company 8 years ago... to file your tax return for years for the citizenship. Nicole! Let's go! To conclude, it's good to live with dignity... without vengeance and complain. I take back the swear word I just said. I just happened to pass by. Good day Sir. Hi... You know... So-mei. So-mei? So-mei! I don't know So-mei. It's a big fish. So-mei. Oh! Maybe you mean salmon? No...So-mei. Soulmate? So-mei! Soulmate? What do you want? Not soulmate. It's So-mei! A kind of coral fish. He thought you're looking for a soulmate. What's that? I'm not dead yet. You don't need to buy a spiritual companion. Tell him I want to buy So-mei. Just pick any one. Frozen fish all tastes the same. I'll get a live one and cook it for you one day. When you were that small? Yeah... Hi, Xiao-min. Mr Lam. 2 intimate roommates go for grocery shopping? How sweet! Not as sweet as the two of you. Xiao-min you look radiant recently. Having someone by your side really makes a difference. Really? Check out my face... do I look like I got bad luck? No. You look fine too! You're fine! There's a ballroom dance class this weekend. Open to all. You guys want to come? It's free. Ballroom dance? Come. It's fun and relaxing. Yeah. You don't have to be lovers to be dance partners. OK, we're in. I'll text you the ballroom address. See you there on Saturday. Sure! Check me out! Dancing King. Let's not hold them up any further. Yeah... Bye... Dancing King? More like a Gigolo King! I'm not going. If you know how to dance, you're a cook and a dancer. How charming! I'd rather give you all my money. I'm not going! Who dances like that? You should hold me from behind when I lift my leg. Not just a question of rhythm, your head is broken. You blame it on me? You think you know your rhythm? You kept stepping on me, I didn't say a word. I shouldn't have come! Yeah...I'm so wrong to drag you here. Let me check them out. Xiao-min, come over. The lady on this side...separately... The gentleman on that side. There are etiquettes in ballroom dances. Let me teach you the first move. The gentleman invites first... Bow, like a prince. 1, 2, 3... Thanks. What's your name? Marie. David. That's right. Keep closer. A lot better! Your first time here? Yes. And you? 1,2,3 15$ % Very good. Much better than I expected. Let me tell you... dancing is about 2 people with 2 heads... pound in sync. That's important. I'm home. Why are we dancing much better today? I took precautionary measures. Absolutely safe! They dance much better now... with intimate bonding. I think they may work out. No, no, no. Impossible! He is... She thinks he is... What impossible? Are you hiding something from me? Dear darling, what can I hide from you? May I? (Deposit for wedding dress and tuxedo not refundable) (Only on loan for one-day photo shoot) (Wedding photos = Sisters' photos) Fabulous! I like it! So, where's the bride? I'm coming... Wonderful! Perfect! You are beautiful! Mr. and Mrs. Statue, we're not taking a class photo. Can you give me some passion? Some intimacy? OK. OK! Very good! Closer! Come over here! OK, This is the last pad. Romantic. A kiss. No...No kiss... No kiss, no perfect! Just one kiss. A French kiss. He wants French kiss... Please... A kiss! Just do it casually... OK... OK, slowly... OK? OK! OK? Perfect! Henry! Henry! Henry! What? You forgot your scan'. See you! Why are you here? To borrow money. Fine. That 2,000 Euros from your dad, you didn't get it last time. Take it. I need 20,000 Euros. That much? Men are all untrustful. Best of luck to your colleague's leg operation tomorrow. Call me if you need more money to settle his hospital bill. I'll pay you back as soon as I can. Don't worry. I lent you the money on your father's behalf. You haven't been calling him for ages. Why don't you take this chance to call him and say thanks? I should thank you first. Let's have a drink some time. Sure. Come on! What's wrong with you? You don't have to. I got to run. See you. You got off work so late today. Must've been a hard day. What dessert have you eaten? You forgot to wipe your mouth. Smells fishy! You spied on me? She doesn't know you are... OK, stop it! I'm not comfortable sharing my emotional life with people. You tell me clearly. Am I just ordinary "people" to you? Aren't we intimate sisters? I told you everything and now you... Fine. Maybe I'm too naive for friendship. I didn't buy any food today. Let's go out for dinner. I'm not hungry. Forget it then. I was going to take you to the Arch of Triumph Dinner. What's the Arch of Triumph Dinner? Get dressed. Are you feeling cold? I have a fear of horse carriages. Look! The huge horse! Its butt is so big! Don't panic. Relax! It's fun! Such a big man...but fear of carriages? That's why I drag you along. You want another slice? It's yummy! The Arch of Triumph! It's my first time here on a carriage. Get up! Get up! Don't be afraid! I'll grab you! I want fame! I'll be famous like Picasso! Your turn! What's your wish? Yell it out loud! I'm the most foolish guy in the world! Eiffel Tower upside down and downside up! Chun-kit sis... I'm so happy today. Are you ha')??? Before I came to Paris, I told myself, I'd live every day happily. I sold 2 paintings yesterday. I can start repaying my debt to you. P.S...l want steamed fish for dinner tonight. That's her bag. She ran and didn't come back. Thanks. What's wrong? You left your stall and bag behind? I saw Hui today... He got married. How are you? So you have feelings for her? She's your new-found romance and passion? And you're married? Yes. Last week. I'm sorry. Macho... She's my ex-girlfriend. We broke up unhappily. Lowed her too much... Wish you the best. Congrats... When I saw him today, I realized that I don't hate him anymore. The way he looks at her... That smile on his face... I've never seen him like that. He truly found his soulmate at last. Take a look at that street lamp. And those over there. Which one is the brightest? And this one behind us? This one is brighter. Actually, they're all the same. It's just that this one is the closest to you. So you find it special and brighter than the rest. Just look farther and further, you'd find the most beautiful street lamp shining on you. I'd rather walk in the dark. I don't need street lamps. It hurts too much. Are you okay? Faster! One two... One, two. Faster. Come with me. One, two... I can do it...l can make it... Quick! You've been driving for more than an hour. Where're you taking me? You've cut loss and made so much money. I'll show you a luxurious mansion. Once you buy it, you'd move out and I don't have to see you every day. Don't lie to me. Why would I lie to you? Well, you won't be able to tell if I do. That's my painting! Surprise! I've never seen my painting... blown up to this dimension. So touching! I got goosebumps all over me. I don't have X-ray eyes. Is that goosebumps? A historical moment! You wait for my cue to take picture of me. OK. 1,2,3 A swimming pool! Why didn't you tell me? I didn't bring my swimsuit. I brought you here to take a look only But if you want to dive, I wouldn't mind. Go ahead. After you. Can I eat these grapes? Eat the leaves if you want. Grapes... I'll let you taste one. I'll look for the biggest one. Sure. There're grapes as big as a watermelon. I want these! The whole bunch? You can only get one. What happened? Are you OK? You sprained yourself? Cramp... A cramp? Help me out. No wonder. You just ran around... like a monkey kid. Slowly! OK. Slowly... Sit down first. How come? This leg? No. This one. Slower... Easy... Don't wear heels that high any more, OK? Relax... How's it? Let's stretch your muscles. Is it necessary? Hang on... Stop! That's too much! Is it better now? I'll put on your shoes for you. Don't tie the laces. Tie them later. Take a break. Let's make our own wine. This is our baby. You really treat it like your baby? Name him! Good idea. Vive I'amitie. Friendship forever! It needs to be fermented for 100 years. 100 years? Yes. You'd be a wrinkly old lady then. What do the patients in mental hospital won't sleep at night? Why? Because they are crazy! No. It's not funny. This is my favourite song. Come. Dance with me. Come on... Did you know I'm happy? Tell you what. What love is... doesn't really matter. I just need someone by my side. When I'm sad... his hand can wipe my tears. He'll laugh with me when I'm happy. He'll hug me before I go to bed... and after I wake up. Just like this. You're drunk. Take you to your bedroom, OK? Ding Xiao-min I've been hiding something from you. Look at that wall. I'm sorry. I'm not gay. I sincerely... apologize to you. Hope you'd forgive me. Boss... a woman's calling for you. I told you not to take my cell phone down here. She's Amy. The line breaks up. Hello? Chun-kit? Yes! A friend of yours came to the florist for you. I don't have friends in Paris other than you guys. A woman. Last name Zhao. Chun-kit, your friend is waiting for you in the cafe. Over there. You look great! Paris seems to treat you well. Chung? Where're you? I met Mr. Chow the other day, he told me you're working for him. Are you on business trip? No. Got to take my annual leave. Just the right time... to check Paris out. You used to work 24-7-365. What brings you here for a vacation? I learnt that Parisians... turn off their cell phones and don't work on holidays. If you're really here for vacation, let's turn it off. Are you happy now? Yes I am. I came here... just to hear this from you. You flew for 10-plus hours... only for hearing this? You'd simply give me a call. Would you pick up my call? How many times have I called you? Huh? See? Chun-kit has a problem with that woman. Somethings going on. I really don't know... why you quitted your job and left HK? If it's for me, I can leave at once and never show my face again. Amy, who's that woman? Well... She said she's a friend of Chun-kit, But I think... she's his ex-girlfriend. No, no, no. Impossible! What's impossible? How did you know? Chun-kit is gay. How could he have girlfriend? Right. Amy, you didn't know? Gay? Are you kidding me? How can he be gay? Look! They hold hands! No What's going on, Chung? You...were quite deranged then. If he doesn't act gay, how would you live with him? You must chop him into pieces, right? It's all my fault. That's really my idea. Xiao-min... We can get over our traumatic past, can't we? Still holding hands? The secret is out! Xiao-min knew everything and ran away. Go after her! Sorry. Something urgent. I got to go. Call me later. How can you joke about things like that? You hide things from me? See? You made a big mess! Don't worry! Having problem isn't the real problem... because it won't be a problem after all. Sorry. You cracked a joke like that and... you think a "sorry" can make it up? As long as you forgive me, I could say "sorry"... a hundred, a thousand times... Stop it! You're so full of lies. I don't want to hear a word from you. I didn't mean to lie. Listen to me. I swear, I won't lie to you again. Was that your girlfriend? I was very upset before I came to Paris. Actually, I'm a loser. I didn't do well at school. At 30, I started working in an investment fund company as a trainee. Clarence, come on in. It's urgent. OK. 4 yrs ago, Yu-qing came and worked as a trainee. She's from Beijing. She worked and survived alone in a foreign place. As colleagues, we come together quite naturally. What are you having? It's not a loan report! It's a ramble! Why are you so stupid? Get out! Those who can't swim up against the tide are low standard. There's no such thing as wasted time or wasted energy. What makes success is hard work. So expensive? We can honeymoon in Paris with that money. Some day, we'll visit Paris, we'll take cruise, watch Eiffel Tower and ride a carriage. Let's get off work before night. You can't get it done even you work overnight. Nothing is impossible. Mr. Chow, this is a forecast for your investment return in 5 yrs. Look, in recent years, as tier-Z and 3 cities take off economically... with the growth in earnings and spending power... I'll predict that the annual return can reach 35% to 38%. OK! Sounds good. Thank you. Thank you. Kevin's family owns hundreds of billions. How many billions he invests in our fund pool depends on you. You young guys should get to know each other well. Yu-qing made quicker progress than I expected. She kept climbing the ladder... Let me take a look at the contract first. And surpassed me. She moved so fast that I could barely catch up. You closed another deal. I'm sure... your year-end bonus will even be bigger than mine. I understand that we drifted further and further apart. But I didn't want to lose her. So I made my last effort to make her stay. Last Valentine's Day, I decided to surprise her. Your wallet is worn out. I got you a new one. What about my gift? This is your gift! You love sea view. I've rented it. Chun-kit, I know you treat me good, but... I'm not ready yet. Let's take it slow, OK? By then I understood I was not good enough for her. She deserved a better future. Though I couldn't give her a prosperous life, at least I shouldn't stay to drag her. Since then I haven't picked up her call or seen her once. I just don't want her to see me totally defeated. I surely had breakups before, but it's strange that, it hurted me deeply this time. I couldn't find ways... to numb myself other than getting drunk. But right then, I was surprised that... there were many people out there... who gave words and action... to comfort a frustrated stranger. You fly back to Beijing and take care of your wife first. Let's talk again after her operation. I'll find someone to handle the business in Paris asap. Clarence? How old are you? Upset by a breakup? Not just a breakup, but a total failure. I'm no longer a young man. Four "no"s No money. No house. No career. No lover. Did you know what's "cut loss"? "Chop off"! I was in the investment business. Go take a break in Paris! Mr. Chow hired me and sent me here. He taught me to pull myself together in a "holiday mood". That's how I could have this Paris holiday. When I first saw you, I felt like looking at myself in the saddest days. I didn't know where I got the courage to live here... offering you comfort and counseling. In deed, I'm not that tough. Wounded. All those wisdom mottos, I wrote, I heard them from people in the bar. It's easier said than done. Whether you can move on... depends on you. The ring in your wallet is hers? You told me to let go, but why're you keeping it? You just couldn't do it yourself. Do you still miss her? You can go now. I don't need you to patronize me. Come on. Get a drink. My apologies. No, thanks. Don't worry. Women don't hold grudges overnight. Dancing King, I don't know how to talk to you. Am I talking to Michael, Henry or Johnny? You spied on me? I don't have time to spy on you. It's my bad luck. No matter where I go, I bumped into you cheating. What cheating? I'm single. Why can't I date women? Single? You think I'm with Amy? Don't get this wrong. She's my best friend's wife. My best friend grabbed my hand... and Amy's hand... and passed away without saying a word. She wanted a florist. I help her to do so. When I don't have dates, I eat at her place. It's just the companionship. I tried. I once asked her, I said, let's get together. Her face turned black all at once and said firmly, "Bring it up once more and we're no longer friends!" You stayed in Paris because of her? Paris is good. A romantic city! Not just selling and sending flowers, I could have girlfriends for that. I can't catch up with your moral high ground. I'm about to break down. I'm tired. Go get yourself a French girl. Have a few glasses of wine. Relax! Love hurts... More handsome, OK? (Paris Holiday: Last day) Boss... What happened to you? Why did you sleep here? Let me get you a coffee, OK? Hello? Are you up yet? Do you have time to take a walk with me today? I'm terribly sorry... How could this happen? Your apologies means nothing. No... I'm really sorry, Sir. Amy, Why was that old gentleman so angry? On the 8th every month, he comes here to buy flowers... but it must be the African violet... which was his deceased wife's favourite flower. But due to transportation problem, we're out of stock today. And he couldn't visit his wife's grave with them. Every month? When love is strong enough, not even death can do them apart I have a feeling that... my husband never left me. So...Chung isn't... I thought you two... Throughout your life, you'd bump into people... you love and hate at the same time. He's a devil and a angel. Do you remember that we said... we'd honeymoon in Paris? And cruise the most beautiful River Seine? Don't talk about the past anymore. OK. Let's go to Eiffel Tower for the horse carriage ride later. We board at Champ de Mars, right? You've always wanted to see the Arch of Triumph on a carriage, right? I did already. You people are always like that... wanting things you don't have, but without cherishing what you have. Understanding things only after losing them, but without the courage to get them back. But he didn't come home last night. This is the hotel card that Ms Zhao gave me yesterday. If they spent the night together, Chun-kit isn't your angel. Yes. Tell them 200 million. See how they respond. Call me when you hear from them. Are you just trying to get back at me? I did turn down your proposal last year. But it's not your problem. It's just bad timing. It doesn't matter. I'm very happy with my life... in Paris right now. That's the reason you're staying here? Did you ride the carriage with her? Are you married? No I'm not. It's a bit complicated. Just tell me. I'm listening. You don't really think... we can start over, do you? Nothing is impossible. OK. This cell phone is our past. OK? Just ditch it. You said we'd start over, right? Just ditch your cell phone! You haven't changed a bit. Still impulsive as ever! It's you who haven't changed! All you ever care about is your business of billions. See? We're like these two branches of Seine, going separate ways. We're not meant to be. Why force it? Have you really got over me? Then why are you using the wallet I gave you? You knew it, I have my dreams and goals. That's the reason you used to appreciate me. This, isn't our past. Our past stays here forever. Hello? No. I'm out... 30 mins later, I have a video conference with a major middle-eastern client. Back to the hotel, I'll get upstairs first... Could you please get a fax from the business centre for me? Sn tight. Hello, Sophia. Ding Ding, is my boss home? I called him a 100 times without getting through. No, he's not home. Has he gone missing? No... You can try calling Hotel Banke. He's at room 106. He got drunk last night... and slept in the office. OK. I'll call the hotel now. Thanks. Here you go, Sir. Sorry, they're busy and just printed this out. Nevermind. The deal is blown. No wasted time... no wasted energy. What makes success... is hard work. You're not low standard. If you can't swim up against the tide, you're not Zhao Yu-qing! Only you... who cares about me... supports me. OK! I'll fly back to HK tonight... and fix this by all means. Are you coming with me? Hello Ms Zhao. We have a message for Mr. Lam. Thanks. Thanks. (Urgent, please call back Mr. Chow from Sophia) Lend me your phone. I have to make a call to HK. Hello? Mr. Chow? Sophia said you called me for urgency. Don't panic. It's good news. A nouveau riche offered to buy my vineyard at an astronomical figure. Of course I said yes. Chun-kit, your Paris holiday is over. Come on back. These 3 are my favorite. Perfect! You two are amazing. Thank you very much. Paul. You're welcome. I'll fly back to HK tonight... clear the company's books off with your dad. Whether you like these gifts or not, just keep them for now. Why did your dad send only teddy bears? When my mom took me with her... Nicole! She didn't let dad see us off at the airport Daddy! He rushed back home when we left... Nicole! But it's too late. Maybe I'm still that same little girl... in his memory. No wonder your dad is still keeping your teddy bear. He couldn't turn back the clock... to be a good husband or a good father. But you still have the chance to be a good daughter. Take the gifts. Get over the past. When are you coming back? Mr. Lam... I wouldn't have kept my leg without you. A token of thanks. Hope you'd accept it. So-mei? My cousin is a fisherman. He just landed this morning. He gave me this, and this for you. Hello OK. I'm packing up. Will get to your hotel asap. Your boyfriend is gone. I'm not keeping this junk for him. I don't understand. He pays me every month to keep these. If you don't want them anymore, can I have them? Good day. Sophia, where's your boss? He came back and pick up something. Then he's gone. Did you find him when you call the hotel this afternoon? Yes I did. He's there. Thanks. Bye. Hello? Don't call me again. Thank you. Thank you. Chung. Let me use you motorbike. What? My flowers! So crazy! I came here so suddenly... because last month... that rich guy proposed to me. But I said no. Because, in my head... I've always dreamed and imagined that... the one who kneels down and passes me the ring... is you! This ring, was meant to be yours. I have it with me all the time. If I hold on to the past... I can never walk out of my shadow. Now, it's yours. Let the past... be he past! Are you sure not going to the airport with me? My flight is 2 hours later than yours. I still need to return the car. Ding Xiao-min, I'm leaving for HK. Though I can't say a million times "sorry" in your face, I promised you... and I can do it. I found my So-mei. I hope you'd find your soulmate soon. Your best sister forever, Lam Chun-kit Well. You're in a hurry? Do you have a date tonight? No, no, no... All my time is yours, Honey! You knew it. So, do you have time for a candlelight dinner with me tonight? Fatty? Get me the biggest candle in Paris. Not in white though. Stay still! Don't wiggle it! I'm scared. Be quick! Can't you fix everything? I want to get it done fast. What's wrong with this haunted wire? Don't! Don't say that word... Are you sure you paid the electric bill? Yes... last year. Are you toying with me? Come on. Faster...Fast! Don't turn your head. There's a woman with long hair behind you... What? She's gliding over... No. Don't scare me! Ms Grand Artist, how many times have I told you? You don't mix colour clothes... with my white shirts in the washer. Look at my shin! How could I wear it? Look! I'm just saving water, electricity and money. Save your mind! The money you saved isn't enough to buy me a new one. It's expensive! Now it looks like gypsy hippie's tie-dye. What the hell? Let me see... Not bad. You wear this to work tomorrow, OK? So handsome. Super handsome! Friendship forever. In our shod life, our pain stems from love, our happiness stems from love too. Some people are willing to wait and stay for lover. Some people are gone, but it seems they aren't. Some people keep their love frozen in passed time. Hello? Daddy Happy birthday. I said happy birthday! I'm happy. Very happy! Some people grow and thrive in love. Some people let go of their past and start over. There're always ups and downs in life. When you see a shadow, don't panic! It's because the sun is right behind you. (To completely "change the scenery",) (Xiao-min moved to a new apartment near the university) (and finished her last year of school.) (She then travelled around France for a year,) (portraying countless strange faces with colour pencils.) A star was born in the French art scene. She's the Chinese painter Ding Xiao-min. She blends monochrome sketching with colour oil painting for a new signature style. Hello, Ms Ding, why is your first show named Rebirth? In Paris, in the past few years, I experienced the saddest and happiest time of my life. These paintings are the witness of my rebirth and growth. I noticed this sketch on the cover. Why is it different in style from your other works? My best friend drew this for me. He's my soulmate. You wrote a few thoughtful sentences... next to each painting. Are those your feelings? No. Those wisdom mottos are from him too. So, where's your soulmate now? It doesn't matter where he is. But I'm sure... he must be living happily. Dear sister, here's a wisdom motto for you. (An embrace of two heads makes this love unregrettable.) I hope you'll read it. Excuse me. Are you sure this is the right way? Yes. I'm sure it's the right way. I'm the best taxi driver in France. Trust me. You'll be there, sooner or later. Miss, should I wait for you? I come to get something and walk around. You don't have to wait. Thanks. Friendship forever? Be good... Don't cry. Mama's here. Thanks. Where have you been? I've been looking all over Paris for you. Yu-qing and I became friends again. We started a business and we got along. But I don't have romantic feelings for her anymore. I finally realized that relationships aren't necessarily straightforward. They could go around... and turn the other way. You're beautiful! My boss loves red wine... and he picked this project. This vineyard? You worked there before, right? So you know inside and out. But it's a little too pricey. If we find a minor partner to pool in, that'd work out. I'll try. I put all my savings in this vineyard... and came here to manage it, because I can't forget... Paris. Why are you here? I... Oh,wait! The first bottle of Vive I'amitie You don't have to wait for 100 years. Drink it now. Wait... Give it to me.
