After 30 years! By then I will pass away! No! Just think! Think that you will pass this way after 30 years.. ..with your grandchildren and your lips will turn moist.. ..thinking that here your lips had felt Kabir's. You are right. Come here. Close your eyes. Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Kaamna! I am really tired! Its time to leave! Stay for a while! The script will be left incomplete! Our.. Iife will be left incomplete.

Otherwise there is a queue outside. Is that so? I love you.. Please don't say that. It makes our relationship look ordinary. "Time played a game.." "Time played a game.." Sing it well! - What? Hello! Listen! - Kabir! Listen! Do you have a cigarette? Its 12:30. Don't you want to go home? Hello! - Kabir! Come on! Kabir! What is the need to tell everybody that.. I am just showing him the time. Kaamna has gifted you this watch. What is the need to tell everybody? Kaamna! Kaamna! This watch will always remind me of you, Kaamna. Kaamna! Do you know that tomorrow is the last day of college? All good things have to come to an end! For better things! Then we will live our own lives. We will choose our own paths. Its 3:30. Let's go. "My beloved, you dwell in my heart." "My beloved, you dwell in my heart." "My beloved, you dwell in my heart." "My beloved, you dwell in my heart." "My beloved, you dwell in my heart." "My beloved, you dwell in my heart." "My beloved, you dwell in my heart." You have become so heavy.. in the past 3 years! with the blink of an eyelid! Shut up! Come on! Let's leave! Get up! Come on! Let's go! One last last time. - High on the highway. Ruthless eyes of the speeding truck.. ..felt like it was the messiah of death.. passing by.. Iaughing Why don't they use their dipper? Because they are high.. Iike us. These trucks come from so far away! Listen! I too.. want to go far with you. Will you come with me? Yes. Till the time I don't get tired.

"Put the auspicious veil on her head." "The design on the veil is beautiful." "My beloved's hair is shining." "My beloved's hair is shining." When will you return? I have to buy marriage stuff. It will take about 1-2 days. Please return soon. Veneration needs to be done in the house too. And you have kept all the jewellery in the house too. I am always scared. What if someone commits a robbery? Take this. And these days, someone is arriving everyday. Both us mother and daughter, alone.. - Stop your blabbering! Always keeps blabbering like a stupid woman. Shall I sit at home with the jewellery? Or shall I go to the city, and do my work! I will get married and leave, that's why you are sad. No! You are happy, because you will be rid of me! You had to get married one day and leave. I knew that since the day you were born. But I know one more thing. You will surely become a very good wife and daughter-in-law. Exactly like you. You know, aunt Santo was saying.. ..adorned with the dress and gold, I will look exactly like you. When you got married. Shall we see? What are you doing? Don't take it off. Mother. Why do you always wear these rags? Look, how nice you look in these colours? That's enough. Mini. Come and take the milk. Your mother had asked for it. See that. 'Why do you always wear these rags?' 'Look, how nice you look in these colours?' 'Mala, you are my life.' 'l can't stay without you now. I'll follow you as your shadow wherever you go.' 'I'll continue to come, the same way like the breath.' 'No matter let ages pass, I'll come on the full moon night.' 'I'll wait for you at your door.' 'Whenever you feel, just spread your hand.. ..I'll hold it.' Remember, Vibha, I'll surely return.. ..on the full moon night. On the night of 'Puranmashi' With the knock of the moon. Mala. The moon is full. Still there is hope. We will meet on the full moon nigh.. ..as we were separated on the full moon night. I will come to you on the night of puranmashi every time. Wait for me. "No one should wait for anyone with love." "lt kills like a disease." "The separation has killed me." "l don't understand how I will live." "l don't understand how I will live." "l have churned the poison of death in my life." "Gave a little love, and lost all peace." "l am neither awake nor asleep." "l cry silently for my beloved." "The tears fall off silently." "They are lost somewhere." "l miss my beloved all the time." "l don't understand how I will live." Mother. You don't have to get up so early. I didn't want to leave without informing you. I will just go to the temple, you rest. Mala! Mala! Where is your wretched daughter? Bring her out! Where is she? I never saw such a terrible girl before in this village! Mind your tongue! If you dare say anything against my daughter.. ..I will chop off your tongue! First go and chop off her neck! Your daughters! Don't you know what your daughter has done in the night! She had gone in the fields to sleep with someone! Oh God, such times have come. What will our daughters learn from this? Your daughter was lying unconscious, in the fields. I was going towards my well. I saw, she went by covering her face with a veil. I would have called her. But then I saw, that insolent man came out too. Following her. I couldn't believe it, that she is our Tasseme's son! Mala, Tarshima is my friend. I am feeling very ashamed witnessing all this. Didn't you daughter feel ashamed.. ..while doing such a derogatory act? Don't lie, uncle. This is a lie. What kind of a girl are you? You are calling me a liar! Look, I have brought this from there. This! I had adorned you with it so lovingly. Shall I tell you more? You had covered your face with a yellow veil. That your mother-in-law had adorned you with! Mala, keep your disgraceful daughter to yourself. We will not marry our son to him. Now this marriage will not happen. This had to happen! She has tarnished the all the woman of the woman! Absolutely right, now who will marry her? There is no one in this village. There was fire within me. His hands were approaching me. My lips were trembling. And I closed my eyes. Even we began somewhat like this. I had closed my eyes.. ..and you had planted your hot lips over it. What was his name? I don't know. I had never seen him before. He was a stranger? Interesting! You were kissing a stranger's hands. Wow! With the same lips that are narrating the story today. The story that you never told me before. You never asked me. As it is, some stories are not meant to be told.. .. they are only meant to be remembered. That's really unfair, darling! Last year I told you everything honestly. And this year I am telling you. The story of that one night.. ..that has stayed in these eyes ever since. What did he look like? Tall, dark and handsome? What difference does that make? All you wanted to know.. ..was the most unforgettable moment of my life. I told you. Why do you need the details? It will help us know each other better, darling. Bring out what lies buried in your heart. That's why we have this ceremony every year. Every conversation.. every detail.. Bit by bit. The way I told you. Now you tell. That'll settle the score. You certainly want a return gift this anniversary. Yes. Fine. But do remember.. whatever happened with me.. ..it happened before I met you. But what you did.. you did that after you met me. Forget it. That's over and done with. And as it is, you have forgiven me after that. You might not. Oh come on! Come on! It was nighttime. I was inside the waiting room of a railway station.. Oh! At a public place like a railway station! Incredible! I could feel his breath on my face! My heart was beating hard! I wanted to embrace him. And I didn't want him to say anything. I did it when I was drunk. She suddenly came in front of me. I was not in my senses. But you were in your senses. Do you know what you did is called? Lust! Lust! I told you before that you won't like it. This is the way you arouse men into madness. What else happened in the railway's waiting room? Everything that shouldn't have happened. Do you want to hear anything else? Yes! Yes! I want to hear it all! I want to know how a simpleton.. ..and respected women like you are from inside. At that moment I would have given him whatever he wanted. I would have offered myself at his feet. You were that desperate for him? Yes, I was! So he left you with nothing. I used to feel like that earlier But after that incident what I felt.. ..I've never felt like that before. Even then, he won and you lost. No. He lost and I won. That boy.. - Boy? What boy? Help me! Help me! Help me! Sister, help me! Help me! Sister, help me! Help me. Where is the child? Tell me! Will you tell me or shall I beat you? Stop! Stop! I said stop! He didn't say anything to me. Because we both belonged to the same religion. But that child was his enemy. That child who doesn't even know what enmity means. Every unforgettable moment.. ..need not be sexual. There are other relations besides that. Relations of life and death. Relations of humanity. 'lt is said, end of every relationship.. ..is the beginning of a new one.' 'My five year old relationship with Sonia.. ..finally ended one day.' 'l even left my job a week back.' 'Now, I didn't have a boss or a girlfriend!' 'l was free.' 'And I reached my friend's vacant apartment.. at Versova.' Sir, I have no change. No problem, buddy. - Thank you, sir. Keep it. Lift! Lift! Please stop! 'Then, for the first time I heard her voice.' And then just like in Hindi movies.. ..everything was in slow motion. Are you shifting in 1801? Are you psychic? No. Actually, there are only two flats on every floor. And I stay in 1802, that's why. Well, that makes us neighbours, right? - Yes. Sahil. - Sia.. Nice meeting you. - Same here. You want any help? No. I will manage. Thanks. - Okay. Oh! You? Here, coffee for you. For me? I.. I needed this. Thanks. I thought your kitchen might not be set up yet. Please come in. No. It's ok. Thanks. I owe you one. Just don't forget to return the cup. - Sure. Pick Gulzar. Oh hi! - Hi! If the choice is difficult, then Gulzar would be better. Actually, my problem is somewhat different. They only have translations of his poems. Ma'am, the originals will arrive next week. We will give you a call. - Ok thanks. I owe you something. What do you do besides reading original poetry? International calls. - Call centre? Yes. - Today's generations' current hot spot. And you? - I am.. a jobless banker. And a struggling writer. Struggling? I did banking for eight years. After toiling with accounts the entire day.. ..with great difficulty I used to write one or two articles. But the enjoyment, the solace which I used to derive.. ..writing those few articles.. ..I never experienced working in the bank for the whole day. So one day, I just gave it all up. I have given myself three years. And in these three years I have to write a book.. ..and have to make myself an established writer. And if this doesn't happen within three years, then? Then, back to banking. Only eight years. Very interesting. I am from Mussoorie. My mom and brother Sonu, still stay there. My dad was a mountaineer. Soon after college, I came to Mumbai. Wanted to be an actress. Oh! Sia, do you ever feel that you have lived those moments.. ..after which every other moment of life.. ..seems insignificant. That makes the remaining life meaningless. I mean, a high point of life. After which, the remaining life is not lived. It is just spent. If that was to happen.. ..then there would not be anything called hope. There is no hope. There is no life. I am an optimist. I can see that. Don't be ridiculous. You have just come out of a long relationship with Sonia. Give yourself a little time, dude. Don't be a relationship junkie. Okay? Chill bro! Chill! When did I say.. I never said I am in love with her? Just said she is nice. You said the same thing about Sonia. Do you remember? Let's just drink, buddy. Cheers! Sahil! Don't! Sia, please. - Just.. don't! No. Please.. Iisten to me.. - Sahil! Listen to me. You'll have to listen to me. - But.. I am never going to meet you again after this. I am never going to see you again. Okay. Take your hands off! Hands off! The Tequilas have come. - Yes. Tequilas. Come! Come! - Hey Sahil, what's wrong with you? No. Nothing. - Pick up your drink, man. As it is, its closing time.. and these are our last drinks here. Good. "Dance carefully.." "Dance carefully.." Dude! You know what.. this is what I like about this city. One disco closes, another opens. Enough, I am going home. What are you saying? Have you gone crazy? Come on. - Please. - Come on. - Let it be. - No. No. Come now, leave it. Come. Come. "Those who crossed your paths." "The got excited like crazy." "Even if I desired you." "Even if I desired you." "Then tell me, what was bad about it." "l forgot myself." "l forgot myself." "l forgot myself in your love." "l forgot myself." "l forgot myself." "l forgot myself in your love." "Sometimes I read you like you verses." "Sometimes I described you in words." "Sometimes I called out to you from my heart.. ..and recited one of my poems." "l forgot myself." "l forgot myself." "l forgot myself in your love." Sahil.. I have to talk to you about something. What do you want to talk about? I had thought you were a normal respectable girl. And then.. I see you in a dance bar.. Sahil, you are drunk? - Dancing with the other bar dancers. Do you dance in private parties too? Sahil, you are drunk now. We will talk tomorrow morning. We will talk right now. Talk.. We will talk right now. How many people have you touched? - Don't touch me! How many people have you slept with? Sahil! Sahil! Sahil! Listen to me! Sahil, what are you doing? What am I doing? The same thing which others do. 'That's the last I saw of her.' 'When I woke up the next afternoon, Sia had already left.' 'She was trying very hard to tell me something that night.' 'She wanted to say.. 'She had Aids.' 'Sia died two years back.' 'And I'm next.' 'When my mummy papa met for the first time.. ..they were strangers for each other.' 'And they remained strangers for each other all their life.' '10 years after their marriage, they separated. ' 'And I kept swinging between them like a pendulum.' 'And the strange thing today is.' 'My mummy is sending me to meet a stranger.' 'She thinks that stranger.. will become my companion.' You can ask me, why I have worn only one earring. Can I see it, please? It is very beautiful. Where is the other one? It must be somewhere. Where, I don't know that myself. I didn't understand. Do you think about everything before doing it? That's not the answer to my question. Dear, some questions don't have an answer. 'Leaving her earring with me, she suddenly left.' 'l had to return it.' 'Without thinking, I got down at that unknown station.' 'l didn't know where my fate was taking me.' Excuse me! Does any lady stay here? Actually I have something of hers, I wanted to.. I stay here alone. You are right. You should stop if it rains heavily. The next train is due 3 hours later. Wait here. Come. "After a long wait, the clouds poured." "l have become so desperate to see you face." Freshen up. - Thanks. "Without you, I become so silent." "l don't know, in which world I get lost." "Without you, I become so silent. "Coffee. - Thanks. "l don't know, in which world I get lost." "The wait in my eyes are finally over." You don't like colours, do you? I do. Then why are all your paintings colourless? I didn't mean to keep them all colourless. But till today I didn't find a reason to colour them. No matter how the painting is, it should have colours. Here, fill the colours. - What? Take it. You should do what you feel like. No thanks. So, will you never paint with colours? I don't know. I never take any decision myself. I accept the decision that every moment brings for me. Just like I am with you right now. That means you don't have any desires or wishes? What are you looking at? That how can someone who lives without desires.. ..can make such good coffee? Coffee is a deceiver too. It sees who is drinking it. It tastes accordingly. "Beloved, you are very near to my heart.." "l hear everything that you say in your mind." "You have sought a place in my heart." "Without you, I become so silent." "l don't know, in which world I get lost." "Without you, I become so silent." That means you believe in love. Don't you? - I will when it will happen to me. You still haven't fallen in love. Have you ever fallen in love? It's time for your train, we should go. You didn't answer my question Some questions don't have an answer. Have a safe journey. - Thanks. 'l could feel a shudder in the depths of my heart.' 'This wasn't the last time we were meeting.' 'We have to meet again.' 'Why, I don't know.' You, here. Have you come here following someone again? Maybe I should ask you, what you are doing here. Anu.- just one minute, please. - I will just be back, wait for me. I want to talk to you. - Two minutes. Aman. Nihal, congratulations. So you got the time to come here, thanks man. So how did you find her? - Who? Anya, my fiancee. You were just talking to her, right. Waiter. Come on brother let's have a drink to that. Cheers. Today I am getting married. 'But, am I right?' 'Whatever I am doing, is that right.' Soldier. - Papa. Why are you sad on the D day? Come on, we are getting late. You sorrows first passes through my heart. Do you love Nihal? - I love Nihal. Do you want to spend all your life with him? Papa, I can live all my life with him. That means you can live without him too. Is there someone without whom you cannot live? I will tell you a truth today. Years ago I had met someone. Who? It had been only 1 year after joining the army. I was returning home in vacations. When I boarded the train, she was sitting in front of me. All my life I will have just one regret. That, why I didn't I express my feelings to her? If I would have, then my life would have been different. Papa, I had met her. Two days ago in the train. This is not a coincidence, son. Dear, it is an indication for you. If there is someone in your life, go to him. But papa, this marriage, all the people, the wedding guests! I will apologise to them. Go. - Papa! Love you. Thank you papa! Go! - "These relations are like the silk threads.." 'l know, Aman is the stranger.. ..that can change the meaning of my life.' 'l will find my destiny in his eyes.' 'This stranger will become my companion' "These eyes search for me." "Come in front of me." - Anya. Why did you leave? I asked you to wait. "Control my feelings.." You were going to get married. But seems like, you have changed you mind. "Without you, I become so silent." "l don't know, in which world I get lost." "Without you, I become so silent." "l don't know, in which world I get lost." - This earring. This is the earring, searching for which I came to your house. The lady I met in the train, do you remember. Come with me. Aman, she is the one. Who is she? My mother. She passed away 10 years ago. 'There were black clouds in the sky.' 'And white sands on the ground.' 'As if all the colours of life have been washed away in rains.' 'To alleviate my loneliness, I was reading that book.' 'Just then I heard a jet ski.' 'And it diverted his attention from the book.' 'He diverted his attention back on the book.' 'But his concentration was still on that girl.' 'And then he couldn't take his eyes off her.' 'Her wet tresses. The water drops on her body.' 'And her footsteps on the sand.' 'Gradually it was coming closer.' 'Closer.' Hi! Is this seat taken? Did you say something? Do you mind if I sit here? I don't have any problem. Please. Do you often come here? Yes. When I feel like being alone. Will you stay alone with me today? Is that so? How? Come with me. "Come with me.." "..fulfill all my desires.." "All the colorful days and colorful fragrant flowers.." "..call out, come." "All the colorful days and colorful fragrant flowers call out, come.." There is a right place and a right time for everything. There, in the evening at 7 o'clock. "This life is like water in the ocean." Sorry! You are looking gorgeous! Just for you! - Thank you! And this is for.. sorry. I like a man who comes well prepared. Never leave home without it. Then why are we wasting time here? Come. Cheers. "My beloved, touch me slightly." "My beloved, take me far away." "Make me a stranger for myself." "Make me yours." "Take me in your arms in such a way." "My beloved, touch me slightly." It's not good to hasten up certain things. In this matter there is no other choice.. ..but to hasten up things. What if I wear something that you enjoy taking off? "My beloved!" - I'll be back. "My beloved! My beloved!" "My beloved!" "One time." "The DJ.." "ls in the house now." "l say, one time." "ls in the house now." Where are you? Hello! Oh no! Shit. Where are you going, Dino? Let's finish what we started. Please. Please. It's okay. Come, let's finish what we started. Please. Please. Leave me! Fine, okay, okay. I will reach the station on time. Yes, okay. Pickle! Pickle! Ticket. Hello. Hello grandma. Why do you call so many times? I will make a mistake in packing. Grandma, you are bringing all my things, aren't you? Yes, I am bringing everything. Your favourite pickle. I made it. I prepared it myself. Even after staying in Mumbai for so long.. ..why can't you speak Hindi. You are impossible. You are impossible. All because of your north lndian father. But grandma.. - Okay. goodbye, I am going. I am getting late. O God, I have to reach the station quickly. What did I forget? Will you go to Bandra station? Bandra station. Come, sit. O god. Lord. Aunt, why did you needlessly wake me up? First that taxi will leave, there is a queue. I will go only in this taxi. Mother, there is neither A/C nor music in this taxi. Then why?

Look, I will return and give you your money at the taxi stand. Sorry, sorry. - I am leaving. Allah, what type of a first fare did you give me? What type of a Hindu are you? You are a Hindu, and you take the name of Allah. The owner of the car is a Hindu, not me. Let me go, don't waste my time. Take your taxi out. Come on. Hey, wait there. Leave! I am sorry. - What are you doing? I am sorry, I am very sorry. - Can't you see? Don't touch it! Don't touch it! I said, don't touch it! Don't you hear? - I am.. I don't want it, take it.

'l don't want to disrupt my religion drinking your coffee..' Excuse me, can we sit here? "lf you don't understand, then why to cry.." "Why distinguish between black and white?" "Why distinguish between black and white?" Don't push it with your leg! It's got food in it! The food's in the tiffin and the tiffin's in the bag! Nothing's going to happen if my leg touches it. Now will you keep your book aside for 2 minutes? Tell me, what are you making? Look! These are 2 bedrooms. And the hall. - Hang on! This is one bedroom. And this will be my library. And this will be the hall. - No! Bedroom will remain a bedroom! Guest bedroom! Now, how many guests do you think.. ..will be coming to our house? Even if a guest does come in an month or an year. Then it's fine. No need to keep a room exclusively for the guests. Look, changing the bed sheet every week. Changing the pillow case. And cleaning the place. So much of hassles! - And what is this? If you want to read the newspaper, then go to the library! If you want to read the book, then go to the library! It's like living in some hostel! Can't you read the book in the hall? - Simran! And.. and when my mom will visit us.. ..will she sleep in the hall? When your mother visits, I'll sleep in the hall. She will sleep in your room. Is that fine? Why will I sleep with her? Am I a child? Stop it, Dev! It contains food! You are pushing it again & again! Ok. Lets do one thing! I will lift the basket and place it on my head! After all, it's your mother has cooked it! Simran.. Simran, what are you doing? Is it someone's birthday? You must be taking it for your kids. It's for my wife. She likes.. balloons? - A lot. I am taking it to appease her. Is she upset with you? - Yes! Why? I mean.. if its not too private. Just like that. She gets angry on every trivial matter. When I get angry, it's very easy for her to please me. She cooks my favorite sweet. And keeps a card with it. "Sorry". When she gets upset, I have to buy balloons. Eleven! And with it a card.. saying "sorry". But these seem to be lot more. Yes. I always buy extra. By the time I reach home, Last time, I had less than 1 1 left, so she had sent me back. Your punishment is very easy. Only 1 1 balloons. No, it's not easy. I have to buy these laughing balloons from a far-off town! I have to travel to and fro by bus. Why did she fight with you? Just like that! The way you both had.. About a bedroom. It happens. It has been happening with us for the past 35 years. We've been fighting over the color of commode! Now, you tell me.. The whole day it will remain out of sight. It will remain locked in the room. It's not something to be placed in the living room, is it? And why we use it.. has nothing to do with colours. Whether it is good or not. Whether it is white or black. But she was adamant. - Then what happened? What else? I had to buy balloons. She didn't talk to me for 2 days. We had just married. You've been buying balloons since then? Yes! We had agreed on this even then. No matter who gets upset.. ..this will be the only way to make good. God is great! We've never had any serious issues. Just these trivial matters. In retrospect, In our 35 years.. ..we almost spent 8-9 years just fighting. Many a times we argued on matters like.. I said that I will sleep on the left side of the bed. So that she will be on the right side. She insisted! No! She will sleep on the left side! Because the bathroom door is towards that side! I was used to sleeping on my left side. It's my habit since hostel times. What could I do? Many a times.. I fell on the floor.. ..and ended up sleeping on the carpet the whole night. Then she might have given up. No! She said that you fall deliberately! And sleep on the carpet! To harass me! Now what to say? Now what can be a more trivial matter than this? We fought on sneezing. Sneezing? - Sneezing! I was applying henna on her hand. I was making a design. I sneezed. And the drops fell on her hand. She got angry! She said wipe it.. ..otherwise I will put henna on your nose. Say sorry. Hold your ears. So, I held both her ears. - Hers? Yes. And her ears got smeared with henna and turned red. The next day when I woke up.. ..my nose was red like a parrot. She had put henna on my nose. I had an important meeting in the office. Even if I didn't have a meeting to attend.. ..still how could I have gone to the office in that state? I sat at home for a month. We didn't talk for 2 months. Then you must have got many sweets.. ..to eat for the whole month. - Am I right? Yes. And her tears too. I still make mistakes. Nowadays, she doesn't say a word. I make the mistakes. I give the balloons. Then, I apologize. So that she doesn't get upset. We have wasted a lot of time. Life is not as long as we think it is. We realize it after years.. ..how much we lost.. and how much we could have gained. Now look at you both. In a journey of 2 1/2 hours, you both have.. ..spent 1/2 hr being angry. I can give you one. One.. to appease him. I will cook his favorite sweet as soon as we reach. Or else I will buy him a book of his favorite author. He will be delighted. Very good! Very good! It's been 8 years. Though it doesn't seem that long. I left home without eating over a small issue. You got so upset, that you never said a word ever since. There was an important meeting in the office. I received a call from the hospital. I heard news of your accident. I have put the glass back on the window in the kitchen. I have even got the fan repaired. Now it doesn't make that annoying noise. Now it's fine. That noise used to trouble you. Now it's fine. And now I sleep on the right side of the bed. I don't sleep on the left side. I've left the right side for you. Yes! After all you have to use the bathroom! Card.. I forgot the card in the bus. Sorry. Sorry. I'll get two tomorrow. Sorry. Look, I've got all 1 1. Count it. Robert had come! He wanted.. to plants the saplings around the house. Yellow flowers. The ones you like. When these balloons wrap around me.. ..I feel as if you are embracing me. This year.. I am going to Goa for the carnival. Be ready. It will be fun! Good nice! Bheema! - Yes! Affu! Let's go! Let's go. So many people live in Mumbai! Who? - Bheema! Bye, sir! Will you pay my 500 rupees now or later? Who do we have to kill? - This man! Oh my God! Who is he? - The King of Mumbai! It happens. I know about today too. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. After your family planning is done, let me know. I will call you later. Why did you call me here? If I had not called you here.. ..then where else would I have called you Pathan is targeting your house. Pathan is targeting all our dens. He has killed four of our men since morning. I called you here so that this will remain between you and me. And nobody else get to know about it.. Hello. Yes.. Then find out! If you don't know, then find out! I want Pathan today! Right now! Understand! Today Pathan is gone! Today we won't do anything. - Why? Because your son has been born? Since morning we have lost Don't be mad! Today Pathan too must be fully prepared. And the police also! On 26th January.. the entire army was prepared. Still minister Chavan was killed. You only had killed him. Remember! At that time we had insiders with us. Those scoundrels! What has happened to you, Baba? Since your wife's pregnancy.. ..you have changed. You can't even wield the gun.. And I have just received the news.. That there is a contract on me. This is called a contract in Mumbai. Once a contract is given.. ..means that the person will die for sure. How will we kill him? With a ghoda. - Ghoda? Not literally! It means a gun! You will get it on the day of the job. When will you pay my 500 rupees? Here's 5000 rupees. Baba, this is the city that we both have ruled. And today some guy has the balls.. ..to accept your supari! You are slipping, Baba. I am your brother. Listen to me. You leave this place with your wife and your child. I've made all the arrangements. A grand house in Sydney, Australia. Servants, cars.. ..a nice school for your son. A nice life for your wife and you. Who will look after the business here? I will.. I will look after everything. The business as well as Pathan! If you were so capable.. ..then you would already have been in my place. I have worked with you for so many years. Haven't I learned from you, Baba? Baba's mind works. And if the need arises, then his gun too. All you can use is the gun! Fine I can use only the gun. Yet, I have survived! Has anybody been able to touch me? Because Baba was always there to protect you. Everyone fears you here, nobody loves you.. In our world nobody loves anybody, Baba. Why? Don't you love me? I don't love you? That's why I saved you from sure death! I won't go anywhere! Seema was pregnant. I was tense. After killing Pathan.. I will leave everything. What about the contract on you? Let him come. Many people come from other towns. I was also one of those.. If he is a novice, I will spare him. I have seen the world. But if he tries to kill Baba.. he will die. You are already scared. What will I do there? You are the shooter. No! I don't know the escape route! You are a real character! I accept your offer! Many years ago a fool tried to kill Baba. Bilal. I used to consider him my brother. And today after so many years.. ..another fool is trying to do the same thing. I don't consider anybody my brother. You have to kill the person who is ruling! I had killed Haji saab. But he was not my brother. Haji Ali. Will we go there before finishing the work or after? What difference does that make? If we go before.. I will ask the same thing from God. Allah, forgive me. If I went later, I will ask the same thing. You are a fool! We are going to begin a new job. Let's go and seek his blessings. I will do whatever you say. Assume that today is your birthday. Your first murder.. and the beginning of your new life. Pathan can kill four of our men.. But he doesn't have the guts to put a contract in my name. Only one man has guts to put a contract in my name. That is Nawab. He used to dare talking looking into my eyes. Today, look at me and tell. Why do you fear to face me? When Bhargav will come and kill me.. ..then how can you face my corpse? What do you say? Shall I kill you, right now? Baba.. Usman is with your wife in the hospital. Your mother has gone to Ajmer. Kallu is along with them. What do you think? I sleep in the hospital, I don't know anything. You are so influenced by this power. You want kill your brother to usurp his position? You want to kill me? Then kill me! Come on! If anybody else tries to kill me.. I won't spare that person. But if my brother wants my position.. ..then my brother only will kill me! Wait! I told you to wait! You can't stop it, Nawab. The bullet has been fired. I have been crying at Haji's grave for the past 20 years. My ashes will be scattered in the Ganges. Where will you go and cry? I am going.. to tackle your assassin. Affu! How are you? How is your hand? There is a fracture. Do you know? Haji saab had met me. He said 30 days.. within 30 days he will secure my release. I got a new name. Baba. Baba Hyderabadi. The police have given me a new name too. Nawab. Affi Nawab. Just watch! Some day both of us will rule Mumbai. "Life!" "Come here." "Narrate, some stories" "Sagas!" "Tell me!" "ln which I can see your face." "Come, life." "Tell me stories, come!" "Ten, are the dreams that have shattered." "Ten, are the number of kin I have lost." "Ten.. stories!" "Ten, little conversations." "Ten, are the relations that were spoilt." "Ten.. stories!" "Ten!" "Ten!" "We filled the pages of our heart with the ink." "We faced every danger in this journey." "Come on along with us, ahead of the stars." "With priceless sagas in the heart, and a caravan of thoughts." "Ten, are the dreams that have shattered." "Ten, are the number of kin I have lost." "Ten.. stories!" "Ten, little conversations." "Ten, are the relations that were spoilt." "Ten.. stories!" "Ten, are the dreams that have shattered." "Ten, are the number of kin I have lost." "Ten, little conversations." "Ten, are the relations that were spoilt." "Sometimes they will fragrate like flowers."
