No, l have nothing with an engine. How far is it to the nearest gas station? It's about 12 kilometres, outside Saint-Lyphard... ..but it's closed by now. I've cut myself. Madam? Please she's bleeding. Can you please help us? She'S bleeding! l'm bleeding! Yeah, just a moment. Where do you want me? You can sit on the chair there. You're the woman we met by the road earlier, right? Yes. That's right. Did you find it? Find what? The town you were looking for? Oh yeah, we did. Thank you for helping us out. Are you American? No, we're Norwegian. I see. That's very cold. Yeah, in the winter at least. Have you ever been? Yeah, when I was young. Really? Did you Iike it? Quite nice. Something wrong? Can you feel it? - No. It's moving. I'm sorry, it'S just the first time l felt it. It's alright. When are you due? In January. Do you have any children? It's done. I've got a guest room upstairs. Is this alright? Sure. Yeah, it's perfect. Thank you. Would you like some supper? Yeah, we would love some. I would! AIright. I Iove this house. It's so quiet here. That's why l bought it. To find the peace to write? I noticed your name on a couple of books up there. Vivienne Noir, right? Well. What's your real name? It is a pen name l reckon? It's so awful l won't tell you. Really? How did you know my name? You told me. Did l? Yeah... ..outside on the porch. No, I didn't move out here to write. lt was rather the opposite. To be honest l never really liked the writing. It was just a job. Like selling shoes or whatever. Something one has to do. You must've sold a Iot of shoes. What do you mean? I mean, since you can afford all this. I can cope, yes. Smells wonderful. Dinner is ready. Cheers! Enjoy your meal. Is this a..? It's a pheasant. I've never tasted it. It's actually really good Vivienne. I'm gIad to hear it. You know, we've just had bread since Berlin l think. So this is really something else. Why do you travel on a motorbike? Isn't that rather bumpy? Yeah, but you get used to it. I wanted Isabel to see some of the world before... Well. We're expecting. Isabel is pregnant. Congratulations. Thank you. So we had to do it before... ..you know, having a child is a Iot of responsibility for a woman. Actually we're going to head further south... ..so maybe you have some recommendations for us? Oh, you should stop by La plage de la Mine-d'Or. Outside Pnestin. What is it? It's a beach. Yeah, we should see it. It's a beautiful pIace. Maybe if the weather is nice, we could spend the night? Sure. Have you known each other for a long time? Yeah we have actuaIly. We met at a party first. I was out with my ballet dancer friends, and then... ..Markus he was going to a party on the floor above us. And then he went to the wrong party you see. No I didn't go wrong. I found you. Well, I was actually a dancer myself in my younger days. But a bad knee put an end to it. So l started writing books instead. I'm so sorry to hear that. That's life. I don't know what l would do if l couldn't dance. I would be devastated I think. Do you miss it? No. I'm too old for that kind of thing. My fianc was dancing as well. Really? Mhm. What happened? What do you mean? Between you and your fianc? Love ended. He found someone else? Someone younger? And more pretty? Is that the only reason you can think of Sorry, I didn't mean to pry. A child can be rather devastating for a dancing career, isn't it so? It can. No, I don't think so. There's a lot of dancers who are also parents. Would you like some wine my dear? Yeah, actually a small sip won't do any harm l think. No, I wouldn't do that. - Markus? No. We've discussed it. It's next to nothing. You won't drink that. Are you kidding? No, l'm not. Put it down. Markus! I'll go and get some more. Give me that glass. I'm not drinking any. Give it to me. Thanks for a lovely evening. You're welcome. Good night. My God! Did l scare you? Sorry... I didn't mean to... No, you're fine. Just don't mind me. Where does the rest of your family live? I never had any. Well, you didn't have anyone? I grew up in a... ..what do you call it? Un orpheIinat. An orphanage. Actually there was this one thing I wanted to ask you about... Yesterday I was outside in your garden, and I saw this cross... ..or a tombstone or something. Who's buried there? Jean-Luc. He was run over by a car. My cat. Do you know who did it? Probably one of the neighbours. There's no one else driving past here. Except you of course. So when are you leaving? Markus had some trouble with the engine... ..but as soon as he's done with that, l guess we'll be out of her in no time. Good. Good morning.
