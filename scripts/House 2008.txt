God came to my house and I killed him. I will murder anyone my house was. As I have killed God. Give me one dead body before sunrise and you can go. You certainly do now... If I can just to Montgomery was run. A session with the therapist relationship had not been so bad. There is nothing Mr. Pig leukt you find. Let me go please. You are alone with him for the money! You are here as at home as they do! All as guilty as sin itself. This house is a manifestation of your own eyes! You are all sinners! Are you willing to do what is necessary... your soul to get here? Three minutes before sunrise. A dead body. Lawdale played your game, and you let him not go! Mrs Lawdale survived two minutes after sunrise. Not make the same mistake! Play the game! He is a liar! He breaks his own rules. You do not listen to him. You! was not invited! Jack Trust me! Do not listen to her. You listen to me! What light? There is no light! What light are you talking about? Susan What light? What light! No! Leave her alone! No! This is my house! I am the one who he wants! Kill her! Get her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill the girl. You do not listen to him. He free from threats! Have you in you, Randy? No Randy. Do it! Jack! Jack, listen to me! I know you me Melissa's death is bad. I find myself... Steph, that is not over! Listen to me, I've seen how it happened. If anyone should die for Melissa's death, let it be me. It is good. No! -Kill the girl, Randy! It is the only way! You need her murder. Kill her! I'm just... angry! 100% No! Stay away from me! Do not touch me! Randy! Someone must die! You're right! You go to hell. You both! Now I am killing you. Go ahead! Who are you! Melissa! I am not Melissa! But she is safe. And she loves you. You! Do not invited! This is my house! No! Susan! Light destroys the Darkness! Jack! The Light! She is gone. You can not retrieve it! Now you are on. Come on! Beware! Do not look back! Hey! Hey agent! Come! Hey this was not here first. Agent, since there is a house... It seems that the Mustang a flat tire and then got past the BMW schuurde. You have your lights still on! When he kantelde. Wait, that's not what happened! The door could not open. This is the sad part. I do not think we are the only one with bad luck. The occupants were probably still alive when the gas exploded. That is just bad. We have identified the driver. A businessman from Tuscalusa. Do what hotels just outside Birmingham. The girl was his girlfriend. We have two bodies here. Jack! Jack look! Steph! Steph! Stay away from her! Steph! Steph! -Jack! We were in a house. A spooky house. I know, but we are not affected. She has saved us. She said... She said that Melissa was safe. And that they keep us! I love you!
