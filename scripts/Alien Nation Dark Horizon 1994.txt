Female Continues In Tenctonese] [Speaking Tenctonese] - [Grunting] - [Shouting] [Beeping] [Tenctonese] Hmm? [Female Reporter] This is not a hoax. [Reporters Voices Overlapping] [Male Reporter] We are live- [Narrator] California's Mojave Desert, five years ago- our historic first view of the alien ship Gruza. Theirs was a slave ship... carrying a quarter-million Tenctonese bred to adapt and labor in any environment. Physically stronger than human beings, with keener senses and two hearts... these alien Newcomers have joined the California workforce... including the L.A. Police Department. They've been welcomed by many... - but feared and hated by so-called Purists. - [Shouting] With no way to leave Earth, the Tenctonese Newcomers have become the latest edition... to the population of Los Angeles. [Tenctonese] [Tenctonese] [Tenctonese] [Radio: Female Speaking Tenctonese] [Radio. Female Continues In Tenctonese] - I want something that smells good. - How about these roses? - No, no. It has to be alive. - For a Newcomer? Hey, what do you got? These daffodils are nice. And you can plant the bulbs. - Fine. - Excuse me. Kermit, could you put a bow around these? Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't want a slag touching my stuff. Mom, they're so cool! You didn't see them. Everybody's got 'em. I don't care, Em. Jill's got a pair. Forget it! I'm not buying you those boots. - [Cooing] - I'm not paying $300 for a pair of boots. I'll pay half! Please? [Engine Off] - [Beeps] - Hi, Meemoo. It's George. It's 4:30. I'll be leaving in about an hour. I'll pick up some bladder and ligaments for dinner. - Bladder again? - [Beeps] Going to the gym. Might be late. Bye. - [Doorbell Rings] - [Female Computer Voice] Visitor, front door. Yes? For a, uh, Detective Francisco? That's my husband. Please sign here. Vessna's asleep. I'm gonna watch TV. [Susan] There you go. Enjoy. Thank you. Who sent flowers to Dad? Let your father open that! - [Inhales] - [Inhales] [Echoing] Mom? The police said to stay back! [Radio. Police Dispatcher, Indistinct] Got it. Comin'through. [Vessna Crying] Detective, can you tell us what caused the illness? Detective Francisco, we understand the flowers were sent to you. - Do you have any idea who sent them? - Leave us alone! - Detectivel - [Second Reporter] What's the prognosis? Detective, do you have a comment? Any comments? Please? - Detective Francisco! - [Vessna Continues Crying] Can you tell us what exactly happened? [Radio. Police Dispatcher, Indistinct] Zapeda! What the hell happened here? Two-seventeen, Captain. Looks like Susan and Emily were poisoned. When I got home, Emily was still conscious. She said a delivery man brought flowers to the house, and when she smelled themm- George, I'm so sorry. - Was the delivery man Newcomer or human? - Human. A neighbor saw him leave. He didn't seem to be suffering any ill effects. Officer! Get away from there! All right. Until we know what we are dealing with... I want to keep all Newcomer personnel away from the scene of the crime. Put Emily and Susan in full isolation. - [Vessna Crying] - Come on, George. You and your son ride with me to the hospital. [Officer On Bullhorn] Clear the areal Please stay backl [Panting] - [Slams] - [Chuckles] [Water Running] [Water Off] [Knocking On Door] Aaah! [Laughs] I'm late. I just got home. There was this anti-Malathion demonstrationm- the killer bee thing. The steaks are frozenm- Sorry, Lorraine. Come in. Come in. Thanks. [Sighs] They detailed George to the mayor's office... so I'm stuck out there without my partner... surrounded by a bunch of snarling environmentalist wackos. These people got no respect for human life. Mmm. I like the look. Huh? Oh, uh, I was just gonna hop into the shower. Look, have a seat. I got some potato chips somewhere. There's beer in the fridge. Give me two minutes. Matt. You forgot to say hello. Oh. [Chuckles] Hello. Hello. I, uhm- I'd better get in the shower. - [Knocking On Door] - Mattl - [Knocking Continues] - Mattl Where's Matt? Who's that at the door? Cathy. Uh, Lorraine and I were just gonna have a little bite. I got a call from the hospital. Susan and Emily were just taken to Intensive Care. - What? - They were purposely infected with some kind of virus. I'll get my shirt. - Ms. Bryant. - Marc. Oh. Miss Bryant. Marc tells me you're the one who sent the flowers to the Newcomer family. You took some of our virus... and contaminated the flowers? You see, Miss Bryant, it was that slag cop Francisco. He busted Lonnie, my brother, for working in a chop shop. Lonnie pulled six years. Six years! I had to do somethin'. Right? Tom, the police now know the virus exists. What if they're able to come up with some kind of antidote before we're ready? Don't you understand? Everything we've worked so hard for... all our hopes of the Earth restored to human beings... of a future freed of the alien parasite... everything is jeopardized because of your selfish act. I'm really sorry. I'm just heartsick about this. Oh, no. [Body Falls] When we landed here, we thought this planet would be our salvation. - Someone has developed this virus to kill us. - You don't know that. The human delivery man wasn't affected. In the five years we have been on Earth... there has never been a virus that was exclusively harmful to Newcomers. Suddenly this one appears as part of a murder attempt. It had to come from a laboratory. Emily and Susan are gonna be all right. You'll see. Look. A falling star. That's good luck, huh? - [Overlapping Voices] - [Man] Rookie Tenctonese sensationm- - Manual transmissionm- - [Woman Speaking Spanish] [Woman, Man Speaking Foreign Language] [Overlapping Voices Continue] They're in a secure area. Show 'em your badge. [Woman On P.A.] Nurse Hughes, report to E.R. Nurse Hughes, report to- George, how are they? The doctor's in with them now. Those flowers were meant for me. Mr. Francisco, we've got them both on life support. The intensive ultraviolet and nitrogen are keeping your wife and daughter stable. - But their condition is still critical. - Can we go inside? - If it's a virus, it must be contagious. - We're not sure. It seems through normal contact one doesn't pick up enough of the virus to become ill. Susan and Emily must have aspirated a massive quantity. You may go in if you observe strict infectious procedure. - But don't take the baby. - Dad. George, if there's anything I can dom- [Vessna Crying] [Speaking Tenctonese] We've set up a lab to study the virus. I've got to get to work. Cathy? ##[Radio. Piano] ##[Continues] [Radio. Static, Frequencies Tuning] [Engine Off] What are you doing here? Who you got back there? Hey. Slag. - [Inhales] - I asked you a question. Hey! [Grunting] Let go! Put me down! - [Blows Landing] - [Man Groaning] [Exhales] Sikes, your prisoner's here. Thanks, Zap. - Sikes. - Elliot. You lost weight. What's the matter? You don't like the food at Chino? Where the hell's my lawyer? What'd you bring me here for? I'm waitin' transport on this yo-yo. Can I leave him here? Sure. More the merrier! Tell me, Elliot, what's new on the Purist grapevine? Does that have to be in here? You're not ashamed of being a Purist. - Purist? - Oh, yeah. Elliot here once burned a Newcomer family out of Glendale. - Sikes. - [Speaks Tenctonese] Easy. Elliot'll kick your ass. What do you know about a virus that affects Newcomers? I don't know a thing. He says after he kicks your ass, he's going after your mother. [Yelling] Back off! Back off! Sorry, Sikes. We'll ship him off to Chino. Well, Elliot's going back. Put 'em in the paddy wagon together. You can't do that. You can't do that! - Oh, yeah. - [Growling] All right. All right! Come on, Moe. Let's go. Come on. Word is, one of the Purist groups created this virus. - Which one? Where are they? - I don't know. But they're gonna make enough to soak L.A. ##[Boom Box. Reggae] I see that I've failed to reach most of you with the lesson I was given to teach. - I thought, when I was a young man... - [Repeating Lines] I would conquer the world with the truth. New Menu tonight. New Menu tonight. - [Man On TV] Only a few of them heard. - [Sustained Beeping Tone] ##[Boom Box. Reggae Continues] [Squeaking, Squawking] [Sustained Tone] [Gasps] No. Give me that. Give me that. - [Speaking Tenctonese] - I was only doing my job. I never hurt anyone. Your Excellency. Where are other Overseers? I don't know. Slaves? You came to get the slaves? [Mutters] They'll all be dead. The Purists, they have a virus. - Purists? - They hate us. They're going to kill us with that virus. All of us. Only two are sick. [Female Newcomer] One liver shake with bone. - You want spleen with that? It's only a dollar more. - No. No? All right. Come on. Hey! That's my car! Get the hell out of my car. What are you doing? Slave. - [Groans] - [Engine Starts] [Reporter] Newcomer activists charge this virus... was created by radical Purists... for use against the Newcomer community. In other local news, the Department of Food and Agriculture said... that despite protests from environmental groups... the agency will renew Malathion spraying... in an effort to stop the latest wave ofkiller bees. [Click] - Can you believe it? - Don't worry. We'll get 'em. - Who? - The Purists. I'm talking about the Malathion. It's hell on the patio furniture. Patio furniture. Right. [Door Unlocks] You got a pass? Uh, where's Detective Francisco? He's in with his wife. It'll be just a moment. We're intubating her droonal flanges. Droonal flanges. Right. [Chicken Clucking] Albert, what are you doing? - These are for Susan and Emily. - [Laughing] - You can't bring a chicken in here. - Why not? You can't bring an animal into a hospital. But we're animals. Al, we're animals, but we're human. I'm human, you're a Newcomer. This is an animal animal. Susan and Emily need it. They need the life force of many nahooma- many souls like these. Oh, Albert, look what you've brought. I tried to tell him he couldn'tm- That's very therapeutic, Albert. Thank you very much. Oh, and Matt, you broughtm- Oh. What's the matter? You don't like snapdragons? They're cut off from the plant. Their souls are gone. Tenctonese believe dying flowers aren't good for the sick. But I'm sure Emily and Susan would want to see you. Please. - Oh, Albert, uh, get a mask. - [Clucking Continues] [Meows] They're getting worse. Is there anything you want? - Visahooli. - [Sikes] I'll get it. Uh, what's a visahooli? - A song. She wants us to sing her a song. - Sing. I don't know any Tenctonese songs. No, her favorite is "San Jose." She loves Dionne Warwick. George, I-I can't carry a tune. - How about Albert? - I'm sorry. I don't know that one. George, I can't sing. Really. Oh. All right. [Kitten Meows] ## [Singing] ##[Continues] ## [Singing Along] ## [Ends] What kind of a problem? Is it the virus? Like I said, it's technical. They'll have to explain. What? [All Shouting] Happy birthday, Ms. Bryant! - [All Laughing] - Oh! You had me so scared. This is so sweet of you. Thank you, all of you. You know what I'm wishing. [Cheering] Oh! Here goes my diet. [Laughs] Your wish is about to come true, Ms. Bryant. We have the best birthday gift possible. They found a way to replicate the virus twice as quickly. - We'll be ready to spray in two days. - That is wonderful. [Chuckles] What about the Franciscos? I understand they're still alive. That's only because they're still on life support. - You can't put 250,000 slags on life support. - [Scattered Laughter] By Friday they'll all be dead. T.G.I.F. Who wants the flower? - Me! I do! - [Laughing, Chattering] Can I help you? Look, um, you've been hanging around here all day. Good night, Dr. Frankel. Good night. - Just what do you want? - Excuse me. [Knocking] [Vessna Fusses] Hi. Your dad call? He wanted me to pick up a few things. - There. - Okay. Listen, anything you need? Did I do something wrong? You're human. Not according to my ex-wife. Right. - Okay. Anything else? - Dad wanted those serdsos. "Sedsos"? One's Emily's, the other's Mom's. Vessels of our souls. Aha. We keep them next to our bed at night. We believe that our souls wander while we sleep. At dawn, our souls return to us through the serdso. Good. Okay. Better get this stuff to the hospital. [Vessna Cooing] Uh, May, do you have any liver chips? - Morning, May. - Right here. May, has anyone ever told you you have beautiful knuckles? [Giggles] Thanks. So do you. May, if anything should happen to usm- - I mean, you know, this virusm- - Nothing's going to happen. But if it does, I want you to know lm- Im- I love you. Albert! There's no toilet paper in the men's room. I knew I forgot something. If you can't do anything else right... at least keep the john properly stocked. Captain Grazer's under a lot of pressure. He shouldn't speak to you like that. Yeah, I, uhm- I should probably get back to work. Albert. I love you too. - Hey, Albert. - Hi. George, what are you doing here? - I'm a police officer, aren't I? - Yeah, butm- I can't just sit around that hospital with Moby Dick in my hand. - Well, whatever. - [Beeps] [Sighs] Matt, I need to do something. Sure, George. [Beeps] It would take very expensive, sophisticated equipment to synthesize a viral agent. I'm tracing invoices from laboratory supply houses over the last year and a half. Sounds good. I was talking to Sgt. Tran at the Purist unit. He sent over some surveillance photos. All the usual suspects, except this guy. I've never seen him before. Hey, Zap, you recognize this guy with Bryant? Mm-mmm. Run a make, will ya? Cross-reference it with the F.B.I. Photo library, D.M. V... county, citym- any place that uses picture I.D. You got it. Hi. Any luck? I've tried Zynomine, Plaetine... a whole range of antiviral drugs. Nothing seems to work. Cathy, uh, I know what you must have thought when you saw me with Lorraine. I'm sorry. I should have told you. I have to find a monoclonal antibody. I know we've been, well, kinda seeing each other... but still, we keep having problems. I just thought, I don't know... it might be better if I started going out with a human woman. Matt... does any of that matter now? [Tenctonese] Hey! - What'd he say? - He was afraid I was an Overseer. Ah, my English is not good. But I want to help youm- I am doctor. He says he worked in the ship's infirmary. Thanks for the offer, but this isn't the candy stripers. - You don't just walk in here and volunteer, pal. - Wait. He knows his physiology. Well, then, he should know where his butt is, which I'm kicking out of here. - [Phone Rings] - Dr. Frankel. I'll be right there. - Emily's condition has deteriorated. - Let me see her. - No! - Doctorm- You're not going onto that ward! We don't know this guy. - What is it? - Her temperature's still rising. I've given her holodka, but it hasn't helped... so I'm putting an ice wrap on her. Let's double it up. Uh, George, I don't know how to say this... but if Emily was my daughter... I'd sorta want to bring in a priest. - So she can go to heaven? - Wellm- Matt, I appreciate the thought... but we don't believe priests have anything to do with where we go after death. Oh, uh, Mattm- George. Matt. I need to get a vase for these. Look, I made the same mistake. See, flowers are pretty, but they're, uh, dying. It's a Newcomer thing. I'm afraid this isn't a very good time for visitors. - Why don't you two go get something to eat? - Okay. Come with us. No, I'm not hungry. You go. Julie, get me another ice wrap for her feet. [Woman On P.A.] Nurse Hughes, report to E.R. Nurse Hughes, report to the E.R. - Hey. You okay? - Yeah. Tried to get George to bring in a priest. Priest? Emily might die tonight. You're Catholic. You understand. No. Are you worried about her soul? Matt, we don't even know if they have souls. What are you talking about? There's nothing in the Bible about Newcomers. Christ came to us as a man. He died for human beings. - What are you saying? They're not in the club? - No, lm- I'm sure God has a plan for the Newcomers. But it isn't the same as ours. Oh, man. - [Sighs] - Matt, whatm- [Exhales] I gotta get back to George. - [Gasping] - Emily! Emily! - Cathy! - Emily? George! George, what's wrong? [Gasping Continues] [George] What is it? What's happening? [Exhales] - [Sikes] George? - No. Temperature. Respiration. Both hearts. All normal. I'm thirsty. Emily. Dad. [Kitten Meowing] If Emily's getting better, why hasn't Susan? [Cathy] I'm going back to the lab. Oh. - [Repeats Word In Tenctonese] - I brought you these. - Where did you get all this? - I keep it from the sh-ship since the crash. I... stole it... from the ship. Will it help you? Yes. Oh, yes. Now we can together work. - Uhm- - You do not trust me. I am different. - Yes. - Because I am alone... in the desert since the crash. Five years you were in the desert? I hide from Overseers. I... am afraid. All that time, you never knew we were free. What's this? That's odd. Many of us developed a rash like this when we landed on Earth... from the salt air. Why would you get it after five years? I know. The air in Los Angeles is more saline than the desert. We're closer to the ocean. You must be reacting to it. I'll get you some ointment. Watch my finger. [Tenctonese] Is there pain? - Here? - [Giggles] No. It tickles. It tickles. [Tenctonese] Ah. Tickles. Your chest looks fine, Em. Both hearts are in phase. - My back's sore. - Mmm. - Her mata gland. - It is a little swollen. It's probably from the fever. To your room I'll take you. I wanna see Mom. I'm really worried about her. Of your father you must be very proud. The police fight the Overseers, yes? No. They don't let them do that here. - But he must know who they are, where they are. - A lot of'em, yeah. - Hi, Matt. - Hey, puddin'. - Brought you something. - Jelly vials! - You brush your teeth now. - I will. Thanks, Matt. I'm going to see Mom. Well, look who joined the staff. I am helping Cathy. Really? What a sport. I think you and Cathy are good friends. I think that's none of your business. Plants, all the animals- nothing helps. Why aren't there more Newcomer doctors on this staff? George! George. Sorry. Ahpossno. Cathy says you've been a great deal of help. Thank you. Anything on the case? Medical supply company outfitted a warehouse... with the latest biological engineering equipment. Bogus corporation, but the vendor gave us a positive I.D. On the buyerm- a Phyllis Bryant. - Ms. Purist. - [Phone Rings] - Sikes. - We got a make on that guy with Bryant. Marc Guerin. He's clean. - No arrest, no priors, no previous Purist activity. - That's it? He's a government employee. Flies choppers for Food and Agriculture. - Food and Agriculture? - They're spraying Malathion tonight. They can cover the city with that virus. Call the airport. Ground those choppers. - I'm just a few minutes from the airfield. Meet me there. - I'm going with you. - I too. - What? - I am udara. - Udara? - He's what? - LikeJapanese samurai. Among the slaves they were the elitem- a secret group of warriors. Right. First, he's Albert Schweitzer, now he's Steven Seagal. - If he is udara, it can't hurt to take him with us. - He's not a cop. This is our battle. We fight to save the Tenctonese. - He has skills we could use. - Are you nuts? I'm not worried about regulations. Our survival is at stake. [George Speaks Tenctonese] [Helicopter Passes Overhead] Someday, Marc, when the world comes to its senses... humankind will honor what you're about to do. God be with you. This oughta take care of those slags. Keep your voice down. Marc? Hey, Marc. What are they doing? They're just adjusting some canister fittings. What's up? The flight's been scrubbed. You and Hank aren't going up tonight. - Why not? - I don't know. It came from L.A.P.D. Okay by me, as long as we get paid. - What say we get a drink? - You read my mind. Go over to Casey's and get us a table. I'll just be a minute. You got it. Let's do it. - [Sirens Wailing] - We got trouble. Get outta here, guysl Gol Come onl Let's get outta herel - [Sirens Continue Wailing] - Come on! Go! Go! Go! Police! Halt! [Grunting] [Groans] No. No! No! [Grunting] [Grunting Continues] [Yelling] - George! - [Groans] George! [Beeping] [Instruments Beeping] - [Beeping Continues] - [Instruments Continue Beeping] - Get down! - [Beeping Continues] [Wheezing] - We did it. - It's gonna be okay, George. We'll get you to the hospital. - [Doctor] He's failing faster than Susan. - Why? What's different? The only thing I can think of is, he is a male. Could that have anything to do with it? Something in the female immune system. Then how come Emily recovered and Susan hasn't? - Treatment was identical. - Perhaps her age. Yes. Emily is 13. - Emily just turned 13. - The swollen mata gland. We need female Newcomer blood. Ten units at least. Hurry! - We can use your isolator. - What? What is it? We have to extract female hormone. [Sikes] Why? What for? - The antibody must be what cured Emily. - But Susan's a female. Yes, but she's at the end of her cycle, so she doesn't have enough. - Emily's in neestas. - She just released a tremendous amount of this hormone. - Neestas? - Puberty, Matt. Emily's going through puberty. Ten c.c.'s. I brought his serdso. [Injects] - [Monitor Beeping] - [Gasping] Susan's responding. [Gasping, Moaning] [Vessna Fussing] [Hacking] [George Yelling, Groaning] [Vessna Crying] - [Gasping, Groaning Continue] - [Crying Intensifies] [Groaning Slackens] [Exhales] [Shallow, Calm Breathing] [Crying Continues] [Inhales] George? Susan. Susan. George. Mom? Mom! - Mom? - Yes! Oh! - Mom? I'm so glad you're okay. - Hi, Em. I'm gonna see Dad. You okay? You were great tonight. Thanks. I'm so tired. I feel like I've been on my feet for a week. You know, Cathy... I thought you and me could never work out. I thought the differences between us just wouldn't let it. I was wrong. I realize that now. Maybem- Maybe we can try it again. [Snoring] [Chuckles] [Frequencies Tuning] [Speaking Tenctonese] [Mutters In Tenctonese] How did you survive in the desert for five years? I was a slave on the mining colony in Yderon. This Earth desert didn't seem so bad. Are those our leaders? I see their picture everywhere. - It's just an ad for spot cream. - "Ad"? To make you want something so you'll go out and buy it. But we know what we want, what we need. Well, it's part of human culture. We've had to adapt. Actually, advertising is how I make my living. George! Susan! You should both be in wheelchairs. - We're fine, really. Yes. - Strong as a lox. All right. I want you both to eat a lot of cartilage and fresh lung... - to get your strength back. - Excuse me. Tell me, why do you choose to live among them? With the humans? [Scoffs] Well, we don't have much choice. Not all humans are our enemies. You'll see. This is a very good place to live. Tell me, how many humans are there on this planet? - Six billion. - Really? Hmm. - [Horn Honks] - [Sikes] Hey. Buck and I got the house all cleaned up. There's tripe in the fridge and a gallon of old milk in the oven. Thank you, Matt. - Maybe we could work together again. - I'd like that. Okay, everybody back to work! - Will you teach me about this world? - Of course. Hey, where's he going? Oh, Ahpossno is staying with us until he gets settled. Whoa. Whoa! Trust me, George. He's not kosher. He's notJewish. What does that have to do with anything? What I mean is there's something not right about him. [George] He just needs a little socialization. Let him go to the Bureau of Newcomer Affairs. That's what they're there for. Matt, Ahpossno's a friend. He's proved that. - George, Susan, thank God! - Penny! Oh! I was so worried. Oh, we're fine, really. If there's anything I can do, anything at allm- Thank you. Um, I'll call you later. Please. - Nice, isn't it? - Mmm. [Door Opens] [Sighs] This is yours? Like they say, the bank owns most of it, but, uh, yes. - [Horn Honks] - Matt's waiting. I have to get to work. Show him the trash compactor. I bet he's never seen anything like that. Friend, our home is your home. - [Horn Honks] - Oh. [Mutters] You don't like it much, do you? I suppose it's very human. Yes, I suppose it is. Here, lady. This way. I wouldn't let Ahpossno in my house, George. Well, look who's checkin' into Heartbreak Hotel. Give her the Lizzie Borden suite. A lovely view of the cinder block wall. You know, Detective, it's a finite world. Whatever they takem-water, food, jobsm- there's that much less for us. Yeah, Phyllis, sing me the blues. It's your children and your grandchildren... who will pay for what you've done! - Say good night, Phyllis. - George. Detective Sikes. Congratulate me. May just asked me to marry her. Congratulations, Albert! [Laughing] He'll make you a wonderful husband. And he's a handsome fellow. A hot tamale. A real creamboat. Albert, my shirts! You brought them from the cleaners on a hanger. I like them folded in a box. What goes on up there? I'll get right on it. Oh. There's toilet paper in the bathroom, Captain. And I wrote your name on it so that no one else can use it. - Gonna be very hard for me to resist. - Shut up, Sikes. - You, back to the hospital. - Captain, I feel fine. - Top-tip. In the red. - Pink. - However. - [Scoffs] It's not a checkup. - You got a homicide. - [George] Homicide? "Newcomer victim found in his car... in the hospital parking lot." George, what about that gizmo he had? That thing he brought the chopper down with? Where did he get that? You're obsessing on Ahpossno. Once you know him better, you'll like him. - Come over tonight. Have dinner with us. - Pass. - Cathy's coming. - I'll be there. Lois! Whoo! Take that one out of the oven. It's done. Sikes. George, glad to see you up and about. Thank you. What do we have? Newcomer, male. His name's Kenny Bunkport, 35 years old. He's been dead about three days. Killed by a single axillary blow. - To the armpit. - I know what "axillary" is. What was the murder weapon, a can of Right Guard? [Laughs] Somebody's fist, and that somebody was strong. Yeah, I know it hurts you guys like getting whacked in the gooneys, but fatal? The Tenctonese axilla is comparable to the human temple. Theoretically, a blow could be lethal. Althoughm- - What? - It would take uncommon precision. - [Cooing] - Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. - I don't know why I didn't redecorate sooner. - ##[Tenctonese] We surround ourselves with everything human... and yet we have such a rich culture of our own. Oh, Buck, you'd better give Vessna her bath. - It's getting late. - Let me. - [Crying] She's probably scared from everything. I'll take her. [Crying Stops] Maybe after dinner you can tell me more about Yderon. He killed four Overseers with his bare hands. Really? Susan, look who's joining us for dinner. Oh, Matt, hi. Susan, what have you done? I'm making this a Tenctonese home, George. Ahpossno inspired me. Doctor, ninja and interior decorator. Excuse me. What we've been throughm- almost dyingm- George, it's made me reevaluate my life. It's time for some changes in my home, in my job. - What? - I gave notice. You know, Ahpossno was right about advertising. - That Ahpossno. - Susan, don't I have a say in all this? You know, that's another thing. We've fallen into this human habit of you making too many decisions... when you know perfectly well that in traditional Tenctonese society... - women made all of them. - [Chuckles] - Susanm- - Ahpossno said... that in Tundash villages, men did nothing... but bear children and gather roots, George. Is there something in the kitchen I can do? Rinse some membranes? Susan, we've made plans based on two incomes. The U.V. Room, the trampoline, the Winnebago. George, we don't need things. We need identity. - [Doorbell Rings] - I'll get it. - [Computer Voice] Visitor at the front door. - ##[Flute] - Cathy, what a surprise. - Hello, Matt. - Susan, George. - Cathy. - Is Ahpossno here? - That's him playing. - Oh. - ##[Continues] I think she was glad to see me. - That was beautiful. - [Tenctonese] - How is it hanging? - [Chuckles] - It's hanging fine. - I've been practicing my English. - Thank you for these books. - I brought you something else. Your N.R.C. M- Newcomer Registration Card. They named you Norman Conquest. [Chuckles] You now have all the rights of a citizen. You're free. No one can ever enslave you again. Thank you. You are kind. You are beautiful. [Footsteps] - [Grunts] - Don't you look like what the cat-dragon ate. You left in a hurry last night. Shame you missed dinner. We had some wonderful liver filled with whipped cream. - Nu-Twinks. - [Grunts] Was it something anyone said? Can we just get to work here? Or is that the kind of decision Susan has to make? Are you implying I'm kitty-whipped? No, George, I never for a moment... thought that you were kitty-whipped. We have a missing person. A human. A rancher named Raymond Taylor. Put a hold on that till we finish the Bunkport case. - Why? - I think it might be of major significance. Major significance? Bunkport probably just stiffed a loan shark. Whoever the murderer was clearly has uncommon martial skills. - Alsom- - What? - Well, I just have a feeling. - A feeling? You mean, like booga-booga, sixth sense, E.S. P? Humor me. Fabric fibers were found under Bunkport's fingernails. It's possible they came from the murderer's clothing. S.I.D. Is running an analysis. - [Grunts] - Hello. - We missed you at dinner last night. - I... suddenly took ill. - I'm glad to see you're feeling better. - What's going on? Ahpossno wanted to know where I worked. I said I'd give him a tour of the precinct. Oh, sure! Why not? We got nothing better to do today. I'm going to the morgue... to get some fresh air. He doesn't like me. No. No, i-it's just that Matt's interpersonal skills... are a little... weak. I've gotta get to the lab. Bye. - You have much work here. - I'm afraid so. - How do you remember everything? - With computers. Like this. I can bring up any case, review files on any suspects, any former convicts. It's linked to my computer at home so I can access the files there too. Now, uh, humans are identified by markings on their, uh, fingertips. [Both Chuckle] - And, uh, Tenctonese? - We were all tissue-typed in quarantine. George, at the weddingm- Hellom- May wants me to wear a blue gown. - What color did you wear at yours? - I was married aboard the ship. - There were no gowns. - Oh, forgot. Of course. - You let them marry? - What do you mean? He is a Number Four, a Zabeet. Albert is as smart as any of us. Those slave classifications are meaningless. You must forgive Ahpossno. He's been alone in the desert since the crash. Here, everyone is allowed to marry. Oh. Equality. That'sm-That's good. Congratulations. Excuse me. We are truly free here. [Tenctonese] [Computer Beeping] - Ahpossno. - Oh. - What were you doing? - Just studying history. Abraham Lincoln. What a great man. Yes. But that computer requires an access code. Oh, I, uhm- I asked Susan. I didn't want to bother you. It also contains classified information. If you wish to use the encyclopedia, use Buck's computer. All right. Well, I'm tired now. - Good night, George. - Good night. ##[Tenctonese] ##[Continues] - Jovan. - Jovan. I liked your note. Well, I been workin' on my Tenctonese. You wrote, "Please join me inside a pot of milk." - But I got the idea. - [Chuckling] Well, here. - What are you doing? - Hmm? The shirt, the music, this. [Sighs] Cathy, lm- I want us to be together. Oh, Matt. Give us a chance. [Chuckles] [Sighs] Look, you don't say yes, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna drink this sour milk. - Matt! - I mean it. I will. I'll drink it down to the last curd. - It will make you sick. - You gonna say yes? - Hmm? Okay. - [Sighs] [Gagging] [Coughs] Delicious. Matt, lm- I appreciate what you're trying to do. But I think it's better if we just stay good friends. It's Ahpossno, isn't it? I'm sorry. ##[Ends] I'm missing my backgammon club. I tried to push this till next weekend, but he insisted. Your long wait is over. In a week's time, you'll leave this planet. - What? - I've been sent to facilitate the recovery of our slaves. Recovery of the slaves? [Chuckling] It's been five years. This is ridiculous. I mean, the slaves would have to be retrained, reconditioned. Sir, I'm sure he didn't mean to question your authority. It's just that, well, we're all just a little surprised. I didn't save them from the virus to leave them here. The expense will be enormous! Has anyone done a cost analysis? It's not your place to worry about the economics. I also plan to take the humans. Oh, my Gm- Well, that's an excellent idea, sir. - Only- - Only what? Well, they're not very strong. - They could still do domestic work. - But they're very ugly. - Who would really want one in their house? - [Chuckling] [Laughing] - Penny! - Hello, Susan. - Oh, goodness. - I've redecorated. Yes, I can tell. - It's nice. It'sm- It's very... nice. - [Chuckling] Oh, I brought you these. Fresh, raw sweetbreads, gizzards. Oh, thank you. That's lovely. - Oh, sit down. - Oh, I really can't stay. The house is for sale, and we're showing it today. - You're moving. - I know. We'll miss you too. We're just fed up with the city. We were in Coeur d'Alene last summer. You wouldn't believe how beautiful Idaho is. So clean. Anyhow, Susanm- [Sighs] This is really difficult for me. You know, some people have this stupid prejudice. I think it's terrible. But... we do have to sell our house. - Yes? - Please don't take this the wrong way. But could you keep Buck and Emily inside this afternoon? - Inside? - Oh, God, this is so hard for me. You see, some people come into a neighborhood, they see Newcomersm- You understand? Yes, I understand. Get out of my house, Penny. And take this. You know this has nothing to do with how I feel. Just get out. Get out! - I'm starved. - There's cookies for you. - I'm gonna get some ivy. - Okay. - Hey, Mrs. Francisco. - Emily. - What? - Take the ivy from the backyard. I hate the ivy in the backyard. There's no snails. - Emily, please! - God, Mom, what's your problem? [Grunting] - Have you read Darwin? - He's on my list. Darwinian theory states that Homo sapiens evolved... from them. I can see that. I don't like zoos very much, to tell you the truth. Well, captivitym- it's a little too close to home. I still think about being a slave every day. But I suppose that's not a bad thing. It helps me appreciate my freedom all the more. There's so much I wanna do, so much I wanna learn. This new world is so full of possibilities. We can have our dreams now. I'm sure it's a healthy thing- Susan reexamining her roots. - It's just sometimes I feel Ahpossno manipulates her. - Aha! - You still think he's the Second Coming? - "Second"? Matt, I have never met him before in my life. Albert, have you decided on the color of your wedding gown? - I called the wedding off. - How come? 'Cause May deserves better than a Number Four, an idiot. - Oh, Albert. - Heym- [George] It's Ahpossno's fault. He reminded Albert that he's different. - Oh. It's your fault too! - What? - Albert called off his wedding. - Why is that my fault? "Albert, you call this a clean ashtray? The doorknobs are sticky. - Albert, brush my teeth." - Hey, look. I only expect him to perform the basic duties of his job description. Yeah, yeah. I got your job description. Matt, S.I.D.'s analysis of the fibers found under Kenny Bunkport's fingernails... contain a particular quartz silicate. Gaminite? ##[Tenctonese] [Susan] Emily, I want to talk to you. ##[Continues] I heard that back on Tencton, a warrior would have to fight for his serdso. That was the ultimate challenge, yes. In a duel... to take another's life and soul. Did you ever do that? I've killed, but never so nobly. Mom wants us to move away! - What? - She's in the kitchen. I'm not leaving my friends, my school, my mall! - I'll go live with Jill! - Susanm- Penny came by today. She asked if we could stay inside... so we wouldn't scare off people who might buy her house. - Penny's a fool. She always has been. - It's not just Penny, George. They want to exterminate us. We don't belong here. We can paint the walls all we want, but we're never gonna make this our home. - Where do you suggest we go? - There are communities in the mountains just for Tenctonese. You want us to segregate ourselves? We'd be safe, George. - And we wouldn't have to depend on humans. - The world is too small. - Everyone on this planet depends on everyone else! - We tried living with Terts. It just doesn't work. We should live with our own, right? He's been in the desert for five years. What does he know? He hasn't been polluted by them. He is still Tenctonese. I see. When you were on Yderon mining oxmer, didn't you depend on other species? - That was Yderon. - [Susan] What does that have to do with this? There were no oxmer mines on Yderon. I don't know who you are or where you came from... but I want you out of my house by tomorrow. - [Buck] Dadl - Tomorrow! Throwing Ahpossno out won't change anything. Look, it'll be okay. Every marriage has its ups and downs. - You're divorced. - Yeah, well, so I know about the downs. - Here's your breakfast. - Thank you, May. - Here's yours. - Thanks. Hey, I got something, George. That silicate gaminite- it's used in making ceramics. Closest ceramics factory is in the Mojave. A small town called Cantil. [Spits] What is this? Oh, uh, marmot entrail. [Shouts In Tenctonese] Scrambled eggs. She's mixed up our orders again. Francisco, is this your pancreas? Probably Sergeant Gosling's. She always eats pancreas in the morning. May has fallen apart ever since Albert called off the wedding. - You gotta do something about this. - Me? All right, all right. I'll think of something. - Matt, what was the name of that town in the Mojave? - Cantil. A truck was found abandoned in Little Tencton. Registered to that missing rancher, Raymond Taylor. He lives in Cantil. - [Birds Cawing] - The last anyone saw Raymond was five days ago. Fred Nader over at the filling station sold him a tank of gas. He remembers, 'cause just a few minutes later, he saw that shootin' star. You know ifTaylor knew a Kenny Bunkport? - Did he often go into L. A? - Beats me. - Matt, I wanna check that out. - What? - I don't see anything. - Vultures. [Vultures Cawing] Tire marks. Twelve inches. Same as Taylor's. Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! It's Taylor. [Coughs] That's odd. Look at the broken ribs. - Taylor was hit repeatedly under the arm. - In the axilla. - What's that mean? - He was attacked as if he were a Newcomer. Why? Sure as hell don't look like one. No offense, partner. The murderer finally broke Taylor's neck. He could've used Taylor's truck to drive to L.A., where he killed Bunkport. - I got a suspect for you, George. - Ahpossno. Comes out of the desert after five years, the same day Taylor's murdered. He would've needed clothing, transportation. Tries to kill Taylor, but he doesn't know about humans, so he finally breaks Taylor's neck. - That's so circumstantial. - Come on, Detective Two. He's a whatchamacallitm- am- a Tenctonese samurai. He kills with his hands. And where did we find that dead Newcomer Bunkport? At the hospital, the first place we met Ahpossno. I'm gettin' S.I.D. Out here. In addition to that, human defenses will be easy to overcome. They have only primitive nuclear weapons... and chemical agents that don't affect us. While we're picking up the Tenctonese in Southern California... a second ship will begin human deportation... in these densely populated areas in India. This is a big mistake. The Tenctonese will never make good slaves again. Your humansm- [Laughs] Your humans are worthless. - You've argued against this from the beginning. - Because we're settled. We have our families. We have our businesses. And I, for one, have no desire to climb back aboard a slave ship. You're an Overseer. You have your duty. As far as I'm concerned, those days are over. Excuse me. None of us can escape our duty. You all have your assignments. Contact the others. I'm leaving tomorrow to rendezvous with the mother ship and coordinate the operation. We'll return... in force. [Tenctonese] Susan, is Ahpossno still here? He left. - Did he say where he was going? - No. Isn't it enough that he's gone? Our village. I was very little when I was taken, but still I remember. The quality of lightm- I just can't seem to get it. Susan, we can't go back. We're here now. That's gone. And you're not going to recreate it... be segregating yourself in a phony Tenctonese village. That's death, Susan. It's the loss of hope. I can't stop you if you decide to leave. But I won't go with you. It's against everything I believe. I have hope. [Knocking] - Matt. - Can I come in? - Matt, nothing's changed. - This is police business. - Do you know where Ahpossno is? - Isn't he at the Franciscos'? Not anymore. Do you have plans to see him? He's coming here tomorrow. I'm taking him to Edwards. He wants to see where the space shuttle lands. - Did he leave any possessions here? - Nol I'm not gonna answer any more questions until you tell me what this is all about. - Ahpossno is a suspect in a murder investigation. - What? We think he's killed two peoplem- a human and a Newcomer. How can you stoop so low? What are you talking about? Finally, after all this time, you decide that you want a relationship with me. - Cathym- - You're jealous of Ahpossno. You know he has feelings for me and that I have feelings for him. - So you turn him into a murder suspect. - You think I'd do that? I don't know what you're capable of. You're only human. You look me in the eye and tell me Ahpossno's on the square! Tell me he's got nothing to hide! Tell me you have no doubts about him! Get your hands off me! Mattm- [Chattering] Everybody, may I have your attention, please? - [Chattering Stops] - Thank you. Um, I have an announcement to make. As you've probably heard, Chief Amburgey has instituted a new awardm- the M.V.P., Most Valuable Playerm- uh, Personm- to commend outstanding performance in the line of duty... particularly among support personnel. Deciding the first recipient was a difficult task... but the choice was inescapable. The first-ever All Precinct M.V.P. Award goes to our own Albert Einstein. - [Applause] - [Whooping] Come on up here, Albert. Get your plaque. Now, this shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. We all know that our station couldn't function without you. - Thank you. Thank you. - [Man] Nice job, Al. [Man #2] Way to go. Everybody back to work. Uh, listen, Al. Sometimes I get a little impatient... but it doesn't mean anything. That's just the way I am. Okay? Okay. Matt, where Taylor's neck was broken, they found Newcomer skin cells. I ran a tissue-type. It wasn't in the computer. So whoever killed Taylor never went through quarantine. - Just like Ahpossno. - Yeah. What do you make of that? S.I.D. Found it near Taylor's body. - It's the symbol of the Chekkah. - The what? An elite Overseer reconnaissance unit. So? There were no members of the Chekkah aboard our ship. - How can that be? - They're military personnel. They're never stationed aboard slave transport ships. - Ahpossno must've just arrived. - What are you talkin'- They sent him. He must've landed in the desert. - That shooting star. - They're coming to enslave us again! George? George! Cathy. The isolator you brought to the hospitalm- I never saw anything that advanced on the ship. The rash on your neck? Five years in the desert, and you never saw a human? You just landed here, didn't you? - Why are you here? - It doesn't matter. I'm going now, and I want you to come with me. No. [Car Approaching] Put your hands up! Move away from her! This is 1 -William-152 requesting backup at 846 East Alameda. - Get your hands up now! - [Police Radio Chatter] [Shouting] [Shouting] Stopl Stopl Don't kill himl I'll go with you. [Gagging] [Bird Cawing] [Tenctonese] Ahpossnom- [Tenctonese Continues] - Don't do this. - You'll be free. You'll be with me. You've seen our life here, our chance at happiness. - Don't let them take that away. - I'm a soldier. I have my orders. - Tell them that we're dead. Tell them not to come! - No! Stay here. Live with us. I cannot change who I am. Neither can I. This is as far as I go. Cathy, I care for you. Come with me. I cannot be free if the others are slaves. Ahpossnol Ahpossnol You and I. For this. Keep your life. I don't want it. [Tenctonese] Or does the Chekkah have no honor? Don't do this, George. He'll kill you! [Grunts] Georgem- Well? [Spitting] [Shouting] [Shouting] [Gasping] You owe me your life. [Labored Breathing] I will take your soul. [Siren Wailing In Distance] [Car Door Opens] Get away from herl [Officer Shouts] - Policel Come backl - I got a good shot! [Shouts In Tenctonese] Cathy! George! [Beeping] [Beeping] [Beeping Continues] - [Beeping Intensifies] - No! Why? I had him! I was gonna bring him down! - Do you realize what you've done? - Yes. Cathy. [Tenctonese] I had to fight him. He had to take the serdso. It's filled with the virus. By the time Ahpossno reaches the mother ship, he'll be dead. They'll think it's this planet. They won't come. [Labored Breathing] [Man Shouting In Tenctonese] [Shouting] Ahpossno! Ahpossno. Don't... go. [Labored Breathing] [Sustained Exhale] [Sniffing] ##[Tenctonese] In every marriage we celebrate the union of our spiritual ancestors... Celine and Andarko... and today, these four hearts shall be two. We celebrate the integration of our male and our female selves. Today we are reminded that we cannot live one without the other. This is not just the joining of two lives. It is a symbol of our universal marriage. For, in fact, all species are created one. We are one in essence. We are one in destiny. We must strive to see the creator in each of us... to recognize the creator in all things. Only thus can we have love and hope. Only thus will we survive. As part of the marriage ceremony... the bride and groom will place their serdsos- the symbol of their soulsm- into the karabla, the eternal ship... as they begin their life voyage together. - Glenza. - ##[Man Singing In Tenctonese] - Okiana. - ##[Woman Singing In Tenctonese] And with the blessing of Celine and Andarko... and the power vested in me by the state of California... I now pronounce you wife and husband. - [Applause] - [Laughter] - Hey, Albert! - [Chattering In Tenctonese] ##[Continues] [Woman] Oh, Albert- [Tenctonese] ##[Continues] Albert. ##[Ends]
