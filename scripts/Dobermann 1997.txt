You send your son to us to help us fight against Satan Enabling mankind To part from darkness, and enter the light. Bless this child. Deliver him from sins and shine because of you. May the Holy Spirit be with him Yann In the name of Father, Son... and the Holy Spirit I baptize you. Do you see? His eyes are like your dog's. Father's water...it's too cold. Don't disturb him. Wait. Wait. I have something for him. Nice, huh? .357 Magnum. I bought it from an arms dealer. Aim for the stomach, then the head. You won't miss. I want to carve a skull on the butt. What do you think? Put it away, this is the wrong place. Isn't this a little soon? Why? How can man not have a gun? First religious rite, then rite of passage. The baptism of gun fire. Jerry, don't! Shit, do you see that? - You like her? - No. Do you or don't you? Y-y-yes I like... Isn't she pretty? Want to get on the truck with her? For five minutes. Just the two of you. Yes or no? She gets excited when she sees a uniform. She's completely deaf. Whatever you say doesn't matter. That's disgusting! You wet your pants! Shit. Man, change your clothes. It doesn't pay to wear a uniform. Out! Not out. - It's out! - Out? How could you tell, it's a meter away? Pitbull scores, now serves. That crow is so noisy what does he know about being a referee? Forget it, it's a foul. I don't care. Give him a lesson. Somebody pretends to be an expert again, I'll show him. I can't take these Nazis. Then go buy some balls. These guys are taking a holiday. You think this is cool? Did you not see them play tennis? You still think that they're cool? They are nuts. That little lice-headed idiot He took out his gun and blew the tennis ball away! They're being watched. He will meet up with them. I've said it a hundred times, this feels like a dream. But it wasn't a dream. I've seen it. Who's the one holding the dog? Don't know, got here last night. What kind of dog is that? Pitbull. No, this isn't a Pitbull. I am Jacky, also known as Pitbull. An expert in combat and robbery. With an axe. With an axe? They seem to be all there. Seems like it. He's Mosquito? No, he's Pitbull. That's Mosquito, he's very tense. He's a priest? I'll tell you one thing watch out for Mosquito, he's trigger happy. Do you ladies give handjobs? Not everyone gets to torture these fifteen-year-old addicts. Strange, my hands smell like meat. This is the famous Dobermann? He is the famous Dobermann. They seem like serious drug addicts. They're all alike. Drugs will hook you; break you. It's the trend. Once I start, these clowns are dead meat. Of course. But you won't start. Cristini, you're out. There are so many complaints about you. It's like a mountain. Go home, let us do our job. Yes, sir. Shouldn't he call? That's not his style. Do we have an answering machine? In case he calls while we're playing. That makes sense. If he doesn't call, we don't have to wait. Why are you painting? We leave in 3 days! What happened to this house? You want to know? A decent young man Broke So he uses a shotgun to end his problems. His wife, and himself. Goddamn it! The blood is making me sick. It's all over my ceiling. I can't sleep at night, because children are crying. Why doesn't he go for the right people? Without faith, man goes mad. Without faith? Without money. You're dead. I know. My sister... Let go, it's my sister! Are we moving again? I guess so. How about some coffee to wake up? I don't drink coffee. There should be beer in the refrigerator.

My sister! Shut up. Help me to press the car. Shit, why don't you get a garbage man. Probably because of the legend. I don't care about no legend. - Pony. - What? Don't sell it. Come here. You miss me? I miss you all the time. You want your car pressed? Are you asking me? Do you have any weapons? No, there's no time. He's sick. That will leave marks. Do you want to commit robbery?

What did you rob? I didn't rob, I made an investment. It is so convenient to cheat with sign language. Would you teach me? You rob and let us wait. Thank you for the invitation. What? How long has he been like this? He's been bored for weeks. He dreams of robbing banks. The pillage... He thinks that policemen have become an illusion. I am thinking with a new perspective, about subtle differences. He forgets what age he's in. He isn't cautious of technology. He sees a security camera, he yawns. How about Cordell? What about electronic cashiers? How will you rob these? Fax machine? Yann, tell him to face reality. We can't deal with him. Not only are banks modernized Sunny gave me a laser-guided machine gun. This is a small missile. No door can stop this. After breaking into the bank, the shock wave will pin everyone to the wall. The shock wave of the rocket Beautiful. It's Christmas. There is the scent of Christmas trees. It's Cordell. Sir, there's news from the villa. A man and a woman showed up They all left together I'll fill you in later. My God... They're moving. They all left the villa. Him...he must be Dobermann! Who's checking out who? Casey, Dushey, Noby They are tracking the car. Lucky, let's keep it that way. Tell the mobile team to stand by.

We're robbing a bank Goddamn duty officer Why do you put on this kind of make-up? Those girls who get arrested always look sloppy in the papers. So what? She does it on purpose to set an example. For example, they may say that you're gay. Be careful! Are you nuts? Shit! Are you coming, baby? This is such a mess! Let's go. Your woman is really deaf? Mosquito, aren't you wearing a mask? I like to see my face in the newspaper. Who else is on this one? Leo, Pony, Big Nose, Torpedo and the Matthew Brothers They're all here? You got a bunch of clowns. Nobody's laughing. See you tonight!

Sebastian Street, armed robbery Republic Plaza, armed robbery National Square subway entrance Montpanas, Beret Street Business Center Your plan worked. There are never enough cops to go around. What next? Claude, this is a trap. Mind your own business. We have to go now. Don't think that Cristini is right? All the police are dealing with robberies. They are phantoms. There are no cops left to deploy. Not one! There's bound to be one real phantom I do not want to miss, understand? Are you coming? I set the time and place for this kind of massacre. Let's go. It's a beautiful little prank. They must be dreaming if they think that they can catch them all. Fox 4, calling Z1 Fox 4 calling Z1 Fox 4 calling Z1 Fox 4, come in. The woman in the Lamborghini has just stopped the vehicle at the Olympic Hotel Awaiting instruction. Fox 4, awaiting instruction. Isn't this a good opportunity to show off? You deal with the driver of the Lamborghini. I'll tell the commissioner the good news. The end of Dobermann. Fox 4 can move out... Claude's men are useless. We are back at war. Unless they can kill Dobermann. What kind of chance do they have? Must you drive so fast? You don't know where you're going! Fuck! She loves explosions! This is Fox 1. Come in, over.

Then I will skin these cops alive! Sure. Of course. Fuck! There's twice the bread and cheap drinks Want hot sauce? No hot sauce, mustard. The woman left the hotel. She's dressed like a man. A lesbian in men's clothes? Yes, sir. It's someone we know. You remember Olivier? The prostitute named Sunny? That's him. Look what I've found in the car. That bitch and Dobermann are together. Fine, where is she now? Her parents' house, around the corner. Good, let's go find her. Aren't you eating? Act casual. They're Fox 4. Tell them to get lost. Go, let's go. Has the commissioner assigned you? Really? Son of a bitch! Go away! Leave me alone! Goddamn it. Shut up! Get lost! Do you understand? She's bleeding Police! Call the police! This is exciting! I love it. It's delicious, Mom. But too much. You're too thin, eat a little more. You didn't mention anything about school. There is nothing to say. When can you start working?

Who are you? Police. The Police. Sit. Hello, Sunny. Can I call you Sunny In front of your family? I'll call you Olivier. Do you know them? You want to talk, we can go somewhere else. Why? Isn't it better in front of the family? Why does he call you Sunny? Why don't you speak? What are you doing with Dobermann? Robbing banks for fun? We cannot so despise money. We must respect money... But Dobermann Dobermann deserves to die, and be buried six feet under. I don't know what you're talking about. I am talking about Dobermann! Calm down. This is a waste of time, right? You're doing all right, Sunny Must be, driving a fast car. Is that car yours? You must give thousands of blowjobs, To be able to buy this car. Something normal people are incapable of. We found this in the car. This is what we are more familiar with. You don't mind your son getting his prick removed? Your son giving blowjobs all day. Don't you mind? What? Asshole! Your mother is not polite. Tell them they are wrong. Tell them! Right. Say we have the wrong place. Say it, say it! They're here for me. I'm not a law student, I'm a prostitute. Shut up! I won't. You want me to become a lawyer, I've made it halfway. Mother, you don't have to feed me medicine anymore. I'm always farting because of anal sex. Good job, Sunny. You would rather ruin your family... The show must go on. You even have a child. You have both sexes. To fuck and be fucked. Where's Dobermann? This child will say that papa is a faggot. I love kids I mean it I want to have my own We'll get along fine We can play for hours. But there is no time now. Julie! Don't move! Put the child back. See what you are forcing me to do? Just to protect one asshole. Where is he? I'll kill the child if you don't tell me! I'll beat your wife! What were you thinking? Are you still dreaming? Such a pity, especially on his birthday. Really? Today is his birthday? That makes a difference I hate to ruin birthdays. Even if the birthday boy is a queer. Everybody should get a present. Here you go, baby. Don't. Don't! Don't... You should have seen how I blew his head off! That cop is gone. From the telescope It looks like a movie. Pity, no slow motion replay. But cops all have hard heads. We tried to kill him, but failed.

New York When you see me again I'll have a little pussy and a huge clitoris! He's here! I can't believe we've found him. Don't shout, it will make the child tense. Tell the Commissioner to send all units. Why not ask for the air force? I don't know what you're thinking But I know what these devils are plotting. I am still going to call the Commissioner. Shut up! You pest. You could have captured Dobermann. Two men are dead because you're afraid. Shut up or go back, O.K.? They are like fine game Tastes better when it's a little rotten. One more and another. Smoke some pot. Shoot up. Let them play Let them get stoned. We'll wait by the door and catch them one by one. Like ripe fruit falling from the trees. You hid your drugs in your bullets? Cops would never look in there. Good idea. Take that. This may kill you. You didn't remove the detonator! Why remove it? Yeah, why remove it? What do you think about me? With you, I feel like a woman. You're handsome. Don't look at me like that. What? What's the matter with you? Don't you feel well? Come... It stinks. Who farted in here? The kid just took a dump. Go change him, it stinks! What? Someone was showing a gun in front of me I came to dance, not to see guns. - It's Pony. - That's right. Others would complain too Get back on stage, I'll handle it. I'll be right back. Right? Happy Birthday, Sunny. This is fun. Yann! Thanks. What's wrong with you? I have to take a shit.

It leads to the parking lot. When it's quiet, we can leave. There's enough beer to last two weeks. I have to go look for my bird. What is that? A security device? No... If it's a video camera, they'll be right on our tails. Invisible, the wall is full of security devices. Completely soundproof, very private. You know any good place? Piece of shit! Don't break it, I don't have any more. - Can you pray? - I don't know. - Pray. - Shit, what are you doing? Don't shoot, I have hostage! Please don't shoot! - We're coming out! - He's crazy! Put down your weapon, or he dies! They're together! May the Lord be with us. Almighty Lord... Stop praying. Get in the car. Get in, hurry! Sir, Officer Bowman. What about Bowman? His head has been blown off! Good! Sunny, you're beautiful. Kiss me. Can I retreive the transmitter now? Get this snitch out of here. No, it's not like that... I will put a swastika on your grave. We'll discuss decoration later. Take them up first Make them talk. Strange, everyone got busted. How did you get away? You know the rules. Tell Yann, it was for the baby. Let's go. No... Wait, wait! You have to. No, I can't die. Forget about my little brother. Pay no attention to what I'm saying. Can't get arrested for a poke. You're pissing blood. Stop talking about piss. Don't make me scold you, it hurts. It's O.K. Remember our first robbery? The post office on Duke Street? We ran out, and then... A police car came, I was going to surrender. You'd already drawn your gun. What did I do? You shot those bastards. That's right. Those sons of bitches. You told me... What did I tell you? What did I say? You said: "Don't let the bastards get you." You're better, and you have better weapons. You're not going to hand me over? Pony... He's not going to make it. Look, it's Nata and Pitbull. Jacky Sueur a.k.a. Pitbull Yann Le Pentrec a.k.a. Dobermann They are all villains. Jean-Claude Ayache, Mosquito! Elie Frossard, the Priest! Have you heard of them? Tell me which team I may remember. What kind of sport do they play? Here's a picture of you and Dobermann. You want my autograph? Isn't this your mark? You all have it. I like dogs. The drug charge alone will get you 15 years. More than that. Much more. The dead officer, head of family. I came for a friend's birthday party! Her name is Sunny, ask her. Her? Do you also not know her? On her shoulder, she's got the same tattoo as you. You don't know her? You must know Dobermann. He is your boyfriend. Poor fool He got away, you got prison for life. You're still young. It's a long road. A very long life ahead of you. With no one to depend on, you think he'll wait 20 years? What's that mean? I get it. You get what? Go to hell! Bitch! You have nobody to lean on. Your Nazi brothers all ran away. Only the two of you left. Bastard! Sorry, David. Include the cleaning bill on your expenses. This man is sick, he should be put away. There. Shit, Pony... No. Wait. Wait! Young, there are cops outside. You take care of Pony, at least until tomorrow. Don't let them get him. - I told you to stop! - Get lost. Stop it, you're insane! Get lost! Go! Shit! Cristini. Cristini! What kind of joke are you playing? Shit! Watch out. Cristini! I'm going to fuck his woman Watch. You lose! You lose, do you hear me? You want to mess with me? Fuck you! Let's see Who's the boss. I'll fucking kill you! Son of a bitch, I got you now. Come on! Fuck you! Fuck you, you hear? Tonight we chop off cops' heads for free! For Leo! For Bulldog! For Pony. Alive. I'm alive. God... Our lives are short and fragile. Death reminds us of this. But you are everlasting. Your love is greater than Death. We hand our brothers... and our sisters to You. Forgive her sins So that You may protect her In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen. This kind of burial is suspicious. You want the real thing?
