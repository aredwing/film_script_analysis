And I had this egg. A beautiful egg, it was. And there were noises coming from inside the shell. And do you know what the noises were? They were... Now, listen carefully... They were... children's voices. And I looked after this egg. I kept it warm and safe, until one day there was a hatching sound. Oh, my God! Mam! - Push! - Push, Vi. - Come on, girl! - Ma-a-am! Oh, God! It's twins, Vi! Renounce the Devil and all his works. I christen you Ronald Kray. I christen you Reginald Kray. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Morning, Fred. - Anything for us? - Morning, Mrs. Kray. Nothing today. Who loves you, eh? That's right, Mummy loves you, you little monsters. Mummy loves you more than anything. More than all the cakes, more than all the jewelery, more than all the chocolate in the world. Hello, boys. Vi, Vi... I know, I've seen. - Miracles never cease. - Vi! Rose! - We know. - About time. Ooh, she's let herself go. Vi! Rose! May! She's... Cleanin' her doorstep! Dirty cow. I told her, you know? She had toast between her teeth. Made me feel sick. Hey, hey, hey. Come on, you two, Mummy's trying to talk. Mum, look! Don't be frightened, darling, Mummy's here. It's all right, my darling. It's all right. Open your mouth, darling. Open your mouth for Mummy. There's a good boy. Ain't you got more blankets? It's freezing here. I'll be taking him out of here in a wooden overcoat. - Mrs. Kray? - Goosebumps all over. It's diphtheria, Mrs. Kray. I could've told you that days ago. Arctic conditions are the cure now, are they? - In the circumstances... - How old are you? - Sorry? - How old? 24... nearly. 23 and three-quarters or something? - Look, Vi, this is bloody ridiculous. - May, get his coat. I'm taking him home. - You can't do that! - Sorry? I don't think I quite heard you right. For a moment I thought you said I can't take my own child home. - It's against the rules. - Not my rules. There's one rule and that's keeping my son alive. You've done bugger all. I know what's best for him. I can see through you like one of your bleedin' X-rays. Okay, Mum, let me have him. Here y'are, Ron. Come on, Ron. There's a boy. I'm taking him out of here and if you try to stop me... Rose? Don't tempt me, there's a good boy. Because I will, you know? God help me, I will. Men, they know nothing. Never have done and never will. I know what Ron needs and it's not here. Cheek. Tryin' to stop you leaving! - He needs Reg. - You're right, he needs Reg. They don't know, all they've got is words. Well, I've got words too. Bollocks to the lot of you. - Everyone all right? - Yeah, yeah. You'll have to move now, then, won't you? Reggie! Take your fingers out of your dad's nose. I've told you before, there's germs up there. There's a million and one places to put your fingers, without putting them up your dad's nose. But he's asleep. Good, so don't wake him. I don't want him under my feet as well. Mind yourself, my darling. Like the fairy story? Oh? What fairy story's that? Dad's like Snow White. Asleep after he ate the apple from the witch. The harmful poison. Chance would be a fine thing. What are you doing now? Kiss Dad. See if he wakes up. Don't be disgusting, nobody kisses your dad. Why don't you two go and see your Aunt Rose, eh? She's got something for you. - What? - I don't know. Go and find out. And don't make a nuisance of yourselves! Mirror, mirror on the wall... You comin' in, boys? Aunt Rose! Aunt Rose! - Mum said... - You've got something... For us! Calm down, you two. Well, let's see, then, eh? Ooh, yes. Ooh, yes. What are they? Monsters. They're not monsters. Crocodiles. They come from the jungle. Some are really big, as big as this room. Everything's afraid of 'em. And when they're dead they make them into shoes and handbags. Expensive things, they are. What do they eat? Men! Oh, look at this. Where do all these scratches come from? - Is there lots of blood? - Ooh, yes. Lots. I just hope she doesn't spoil them, that's all. God knows, she hasn't got two brass farthings to rub together, yet every time they go round she gives them something. No wonder they're round there so much. I sometimes think I'm only here to cook their meals and wash their clothes. - She means well, Vi. - I know, Mum, but that's not the point. It's all this love pouring out. - The twins are so lovely, Vi. - I know they are, May, I know, but can't you just love someone and leave it at that? Oh, I dunno... Love's a funny thing. Hmm... Look at Charlie watching Dad. I sometimes think we forget all about Charlie. He's as happy as a sand boy. Come on in for a cuppa, Dad! You'll catch your death. In a minute. Charlie? You come in and put your jumper on if you're staying out there. What's he training for anyway at his age, I'd like to know. Christ knows. Wants to make his own coffin probably. Silly old fool. Mam, that's wicked. Wicked but true. Men are born children and they stay children. They scream and shout and boss people around, like your father. And they think they're in control, but they don't know the half of it. Not half. This was your great-grandmother's table. Lovely wood, walnut. We had a dream last night. We had the same dream. Tell me the dream. Dreamt we were standing in the streets, and suddenly we started to rise up. To fly. Didn't have wings or anything, but we flew. You were watching us and we keep flying up and up. We can't stop. Just up to the sun. That's Charlie Kray's place on the end, innit? Oh, thanks, mate. - Come on, boys. - What? No arguments, come on! Right, Charlie Kray, I've got you at last. - Get inside, warn your mum. - Okay. I'll keep the nosy old bastard talking. Excuse me. - Wake! - Quick! - Up. - Copper. Cellar. Having trouble? - Mind your own. - Yeah, shove off. just doing my duty. Don't pester me, Rosie, there's a good girl. Bloody "good girl". Who do you think you're talking to? Hey! Mum! What a mess. May? - A broom. - And mop and bucket. - A woman's work's never done, Constable. - Bloody mess. What's all this palaver? That is a lethal weapon, that is. Housework is a lethal business, Constable. I'm looking for your husband, Violet. When you find him, let me know. I've got three hungry mouths here need feeding. Yeah. Where is he, then, eh? Eh? Your husband should be out there fighting the war, like everyone else. Excuse me, madam. Ah... - Our dad's not an idiot. - Wouldn't hide in the coal cupboard. Would he? Hmm. Never mind. I'll have him yet. All right, come with me, join these other people. he could smell a copper half a mile away. Nose like a bleedin' dog, he had. Got stabbed in the neck. Walked from Aldgate to Mile End. Leaving a trail of blood three mile long. I'll tell you something, them bloodstains are still there today. Not wind, not snow, not human washing can get 'em out. I saw them bloodstains once, underneath the arches, where Jack the Ripper cut up his victims. He used to cut 'em from here to here. Gutted 'em like a bleedin' fish. Makes it sound so bloody glamorous. It's true, I tell ya. My old mum seen him once, Jack the Ripper. Seen him with her own eyes down Brick Lane. Tall, he was. Dressed in a long black cape. Face as white as chalk. Teeth sharp as little razors. And his eyes... Cor, his eyes. Red, they was. Glowed like stars. My mum were only a young woman when she saw him. She went grey overnight. Took all the bleedin' color out of her hair, he did. All right, it's all right, my darlings, all right. No one's gonna hurt you. Not with me around. They wouldn't dare. They wouldn't bloody well dare. Words! Words are rich and wonderful. We can say anything we like. Words get into your skin. They are like an illness, they can infect you... - Ow! - Words are a disease, but a wonderful disease. A disease without a cure. Words are weapons, and we must use them carefully! Boy! - Aah! - Come on... Give me a wonderful word. Sir? Come on, there's millions to choose from. Tell me a wonderful word. Mum. Mum! Quiet! Mum? Did you say "Mum"? Sit down, you idiot. Mum might be wonderful to you, not to me. All right, then, who else? Who else can give me a wonderful word? I crave a wonderful word. My whole body yearns... for a wonderful word! Krays! Save my life, give me a wonderful word. Crocodile. Crocodile? Crocodile, yes... That might be wonderful. All right. Ronald. Choose a poem, and read it to us in your velvet tones. What poem, sir? Any, boy. Just read. "From childhood's hour I have not been "As o-others were I have not seen..." Go on. "As others saw I could not bring "My passion from a common spring "From the same source I have not taken "My sorrow... "I could not awaken "My heart to joy at the same time "And all I loved I loved alone "Then in my childhood "In the dawn of the most stormy life "Is drawn from every depth of good and ill The mystery which binds me still "From the torrent or the fountain "From the red cliff of the mountain "From the sun that round me rolled In its autumn tint of gold "From the lightning in the sky As it passed me flying by "From the thunder in the storm "And the cloud that took the form "When the rest of heaven was blue "Of a demon in my view" Wonder what would've happened if they'd lived? That couldn't have lived. Just imagine. One eats and it goes in the other's belly. - Here, you want some? - I couldn't eat now! - Must be the first bloody time! - Shut it, Eddie! And stop that scratchin'. You're makin' me bloody itch. Just think of it, stuck together like that. Livin' and joined together. They're better off dead. Should've been burned. It's not right, is it? Everyone standing round staring at 'em. Just like us. I think they look great. - Hello, Mum. - Hello, boys. Come on, boys, let's go and show 'em some real boxing! Let's watch the boxing, old gal. No! Don't you "old gal" me. Pooh! Your breath! Come on, fellas! Let's show 'em some real boxing. Out the way. Shift yourself. Ohhh... Three rounds with Kid McCall. Have we got a fighter? Come on, out the way! Get my bleedin' jacket off. Come on, Grandad. What you doin'? Pack it in! What's your name? Cannonball Lee. Cannonball Lee? Stay three rounds you get a quid. I'll tear his bleedin' head off! Ladies and gentlemen! Cannonball Lee. Cannonball! Cannonball! Come on, out you come. Who else wants a go? Get him out. Go and have your dinner. Who's gonna have a go? One of you? Three rounds. Three rounds, earn yourself a quid. What about you lot down there? You look like brothers. One of you! The biggest one! Come on, take his coat! Go on, Ronnie! What's your name? - Ronnie Kray. - Ronnie Kray? - Where from? - Bethnal Green. Ronnie Kray, ladies and gentlemen! Mucky or clean, please yourself. Shake hands. And the winner! Ronnie Kray! Want another go? - Yeah. - Good. He wants another go with anybody out there. Who wants a go? Come on, one of you. Come on, who's gonna have a go? Never mind the weight, never mind the size! Come on, who's gonna have a go? Three rounds with our Ron! Come on, then. Hurry up! Reg? What you doing, Reg? What's your name? Reggie Kray. Reggie Kray, Ronnie Kray. You brothers? Yeah. Yeah? Ladies and gentlemen, the Kray brothers! I don't care what you do, as long as you give 'em a show. Shake hands and come out fighting. Back to your corners, boys. Pack it in! Ronnie! Reg! Why are you doing this? Stop the fight! Hurt 'im! Pack it in! Mum? Mum! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop! When you were born, when I held you in my arms and thought to myself, "There'll be no more hurt. I've got my boys now," I thought. My boys to protect me. - Don't, Mum. - Don't tell me don't. What have we got, all of us? Nothing. Except each other. God in heaven, I never thought I'd live to see the day. This is your bloody fault. - I thought they were very good. - For once in your life know when to shut up. Oh... I thought it was a bleedin' good fight. Fight? Fight? I'll tell you what fighting is. Fighting is trying to bring up three kids during a war, without enough bloody food to feed a cat on. That's what fighting is! Gone through all that to have my heart broken like this. - Broken! - All right, come on. Listen to me, boys. We don't fight each other. We stick together. That's how we're strong. If you want something, you fight, yes. But you fight like I fight. You fight them out there. But we don't fight each other. Not for fun, not for money... Not for no reason. I'm sorry, Mum. Sorry. I warned you two. You mean everything to me. Don't spoil it. Morning, Mrs. Kray. Morning! Bloody National Service. What right have they got? No one takes my boys away from me. No one. - It'll do 'em good. - What do you know about it? More than you think. - What? - Things. Oh, things. I see. Things. How to hide from the police and sit in that bloody armchair all day. Hey! What do you know about it, woman? Stuck in this house all your sodding life. Listen to me, Charlie Kray. A house is a bloody battleground all on its own. I don't have to go outside for death and heartache, I've got it right here on my bloody doorstep. And don't you dare preach to me. You spent your whole life lying and cheating. What've you got to show for it? An armchair full of mothballs. Go on, I dare you. Only if you do, you better kill me, Charlie Kray. Because I swear on my mother's life, I'll slit your throat while you're asleep. You dare touch Mum. - What? - You heard him. Just don't. You are not people any more. You are not human beings. You are part of a machine. You do not wear or think what you want. You wear what we tell you, think what we tell you, eat, sleep, shit and fuck when we tell you! - Someone stick a feather up your arse, lad? - Sarge. You're grinning like a bloody Cheshire cat! And where do you little darlings think you're off to? - Home! - For a cup of tea with our mum. Get your nasty little arses back in 'ere! You got nothing to say and you're saying it too loud, so... Bollocks. Quiet! I know your name. Kray. And I think to meself, "George," I think... "These boys are special. "These boys are a new kind." You've got it. You've got it... And I can see it. And you've gotta learn how to use it. Now, there's lots of people out there, lots of people, who don't like to be hurt. Not them... or their property. Now, these people, who don't like to be hurt, pay people not to hurt 'em. You know what I'm talkin' about, don't ya? 'Course you do. Now, when you boys get out of here, you keep your eyes wide open. Watch out for the people who don't wanna be hurt. 'Cause you scare the shit out of me, boys. Wonderful. This place used to be so beautiful. Chandeliers, gold trimmings, little cherubs with bunches of grapes. Yeah? - Enjoy yourselves, lads? - Nah. That's good. Little cherubs. Bunches of grapes. You are looking younger, Mr. Willoughby. What is it? New aftershave, perhaps? You're early. - A mere five minutes. - I haven't had time to count it. Coat, please. Sorry. What's it like out? Still raining? - Spitting. - Bloody weather. Coat, please. Still spitting, Reg. - Is that right? - Not as bad as it was. We haven't got an umbrella either. That's always the way. Huh. Is this a joke? Do you see me laughing? No, let me go! No! Oh, no! No! No! N... Right. Now you go back, and you tell Rimmerman, no one fucks with us. This is nothing! Give me your hand. Do it! Oh... no! Oh, no... no! Just show 'em this, and tell him we let you off lightly! Hear me? Say thank you. Say thank you! Say thank you. Thank you... How much did this place cost you when you first bought it? Five quid. You were robbed. We'll get your little cherubs back. Look at you. Proper little gentlemen. You make me feel proud. The both of you. Make it all mean something. Anyway, never mind about you. What do I look like, hmm? - Lovely, Mum. - Beautiful. Really? I don't look like mutton dressed as lamb? You'll be princess of the ball. Oh, wicked queen, more like. Da-daa! Oh, here's your fairy godmother! The carriage awaits outside. Let's get in before it turns into a pumpkin. Look at 'em, Rose. What do they look like? Stop it, Mum. You're not shy in front of Aunt Rose, are you? Mum... Tell Aunt Rose where you got your clothes. Come on, spit it out. Tell her. Savile Row. Savile Row. Reggie, open your jacket and show Aunt Rose the cut of your shirt. Isn't that beautiful? Look at this, Rose, look at this. Oh! Do you know, Dad'd have to work a whole year to earn a shirt like that. What do you feel like, when you're at your club? Like kings. Like kings. - Oh, it's beautiful. Beautiful. - Take them in to get a drink. - Okay. - Where are you going? Back in a second. You enjoy yourself. - Mrs. Kray? - Always on the move. - Reggie? - Aunt Rose. Give it to me again, fellas. d First you put your two knees close up tight d Swing 'em to the left, or you swing 'em to the right d Step around the floor kinda nice and light d Then you twist around, twist around, with all your might d Spread your lovin' arms way out in space d You do the Eden Rock with such style and grace d You put your left foot out d You pull it back d And that's what I call balling the jack d I said they should come here. They knew the place, Reg. - They're on the run. - Yeah, no trouble. You did right, Den. How old are you, boys? 16, Mr. Kray. Need some clothes and a hot meal, yeah? Yes, sir. We're starving. Now, you take this... and you get what you need. Clothes are important. Make you what you are. Look after 'em, Den. Make sure they're safe. Come on, lads. Your tie's crooked. So's yours. d You put your left foot out d And then you pull it back d And that's what I call balling the jack, yeah! d Good evening, everybody. Welcome to our... little club. You all look marvelous. Really, you've done us proud. Thank you. But first I'd like to introduce you to the boss! Who you can go to with all your troubles. No matter how small they are, he wants to help. Hope everything comes out all right. Okay. What a geezer you are, eh? Thanks, mate. All right, boy! All right! What d'you say? Me? I... Nothing. 'Cause you did. What d'you call me? Nothing, honestly. I didn't say a word. - You call me a boy? - I didn't say nothing. You wanker! Boy?! Is this all the work of a fucking boy? Excuse me. - Leave it out, all right? It's a private fight. - He ain't done nothing! - You stupid bastard! - Leave him! Stupid sod. C'mon, cut me. Look! I don't want any trouble! Go on, cut me. Ain't got the guts, have you? Cut me! Go on! Come on, there's no need for violence. We're acting like a bunch of kids here. It's stupid. Let's just forget the whole thing, eh? That's better. You don't wanna go threatenin' people with knives. Not when I've got one as well. You laugh at me, eh? I'll make you laugh for the rest of your life. Ronnie! Why are you doin' this to me? Ah... You scared me, Ronnie. Well, I can take care of myself. You go back to the party. Talk to the donkey. You made a right mess of his face. Well, they scooped up enough to put it back together. What're you wearing? Dunno. Why? I don't like it. Change it. And those shoes! Well, you bought them for me. I'll have to buy you some more, won't I? Go on, get out. I wanna get Mum something. We get her lots of things. You know how she carries on. Don't spend your money on me, spend it on yourself. But she needs something to keep her company. I mean, now we're not there so much. Yeah, well, I'm there whenever I can. Oh, bloody hell, this is a new shirt. That won't notice with your jacket on. I'll give it to our May to wash. I had my perfect dream last night. What's that? I was asleep in bed, and I looked just like you. Go on. Soddin' bloodstains. They do show. So what shall we get Mum? It's very big. Don't you think? After all, most of the time it just sits there. Reg says everyone'll have one soon. Mmm, Charlie says the same. When does it come on, then? When it gets darker, I suppose. Hmm, nice car. Green. He's brought flowers, too. You can't just sit there like it's not happening. I can do what I like in my own house. You've got to make an effort, for Frances' sake. Frank? - Frank! - All right! But don't expect me to talk to him. I didn't fight in the war... for the likes of him. Nice cake. Thanks, Reg. I... I think it would be nice to bake my own cakes, but really there isn't the time. Though Frank would like me to, wouldn't you, Frank? All the same to me. Cakes is cakes. That's not what he says to me. Frank's mother was a great cake-maker. Of course, she kept hens, so she was halfway there. What's your job? I told you, Dad. Reg owns some clubs. Must pay well. Having a car like that? Keeps me comfortable, Mr. Lawson. Er, more cake? Oh, for God's sake. He doesn't want any more cake. Shall we go outside, Reg? I'll show you the garden, eh? Thanks. Reg, I'm sorry. Don't be. It's natural for a dad to make sure his daughter can be looked after. Just natural. You've got a lovely garden. Nice roses. My mum loves roses. What is it? It's a present. Well, open it. It's a crocodile. It's a brooch. Used to belong to my aunt. It's beautiful. Don't worry, it's not gonna bite you. You hear such stories. They're just stories. About what they do. Crocodiles are harmless. It scares you. They'd never harm you. I wanna wear it now. Put it on. I can see things. Where? In your eyes. What things? Monsters. You look lovely. That's where we live. Number 30. They're not all yours, are they? No. They're not all mine. I'm glad I got the bone china. She'll take us as she finds us. - Mum. - Hello, love. Come on in. - This is Frances. - Hello! Now, you make yourself at home, darling. May, move yourself. You sit down there, love, eh? Budge up, Doris. Oh, she's lovely. She's an angel, Reg. Really. That's right. She's an angel. - An angel. - Just leave her alone, you lot. Reg, now you're here, give me a hand with the tea things. Your friends are upstairs. You can bring the biscuits. Well, come on, darling. Won't be a minute. Here you are, boys! Mind your backs, my darling, this tea is boiling hot. - Can you manage? - That's it. Thank you. Reg has got the biscuits. Make sure he doesn't scoff them all, they're his favorites. Ron, have you got to bring that bloody thing indoors? It's got germs, I swear it has. It's clean, Mum. Honest. If you want something, bang on the floor. - I'll be downstairs with Frances. - Thanks, Mum. - See you later, boys. - Bye, Mrs. Kray. You're late for the meeting. Didn't know there was one. It was called urgently. - By who? - By me. Put the biscuits down. It's the Maltese boys. It's serious, Reg. They're out of order. Threats were made at the Regal. Anybody want tea? - No milk in mine. - No milk? That's disgusting. - What kind of threats? - Does it matter? We should teach 'em a lesson. You always think that. - I'm always right. - Pass the biscuits. - Any Rich Tea? - Can I have a biscuit? I don't like it! The Maltese are creeping up and our eyes are elsewhere and we're all getting lazy. Distracted. It's gotta be tightened up. These Maltese have gotta go. Yeah? Yeah! Men are born children and they stay children. They scream and shout and boss people around. They think they're in control, but don't know the half of it. It's a lovely outfit, pet. Really suits you. Mmm. Thank you. We didn't notice clothes much when I was your age. - When I was young... - More tea, Mum? Know what I did during the war? I don't think Frances wants to hear about that. Cut pieces of cloth for quilt-making. Small pieces, no bigger than your handkerchief. D'you know how many I used to cut? 400. 400 an hour. Can you imagine a man doing that? Drove us mad, it did. Made us want to scream. I did once too. Scream, that is. Stood in the road and screamed till I was blue in the face, and no one batted an eyelid. Why should they? There was a lot of screaming in them days. Ah, that sounds like the boys. You going, boys? Bye bye. Cheers, Mrs. Kray. Take care. - You're welcome. Be good! - Lovely biscuits, Mrs. Kray. You're welcome. Er, I've gotta go. You stay here? Where you going? Business. You'll wear yourselves out, you boys. Have you met Frances, Ron? Hello. Hello, Ron. Come on, Reg. Car's waiting outside. Reg, I've got to go home. - See you, Mum. - Bye, darling. - Bye, Mum. - Bye, love. I won't be long. All right. Remember, lads, scare them to fucking jelly. I want these fucking Maltese brothers off the map once and for all. So, er, so what d'you think of her? Who? Frances. Very pretty. Get ready. You gonna marry her? Yeah. Oh, girls. Ooh, thank God there isn't a wedding every day, that's all I can say. Ooh! - You smell awful. - Give us a kiss. Go to bed, you revolting man! Ooh, get off! They looked lovely, though, didn't they? They did, didn't they, May? My own son married and on his honeymoon. I can't believe it. Think I've lost him, May? Reg? Must be joking. You'll always come first, Vi. What's the matter, Rose? Rose? I was just thinking. I was on the bus the other day and some old toerag was boasting about all he'd suffered in the war. Stupid old... I'll tell you, they don't know. It was the women who had the war, the real war. The women were left at home in the shit, not sitting in some sparkling plane or gleaming tank. There was no glamour for us. They should've been with me when old Pauline Woolley went into labor. - D'you remember that, Violet? - Yes, yes, I do. Seven hours of screaming down Bethnal Green bloody tube station. And then I had to cut the baby's head off to save the mother's life. She died anyway, poor old cow. God, there was so much blood. Jesus. And the abortions. Those poor girls. One day they'll drain Victoria Park lake. And you know what they'll find? What glorious remnants of the Second World War? Babies, that's what. Bullets and dead babies. Men! Mum's right. They stay kids all their fucking lives and they end up heroes. Or monsters. Either way they win. Women have to grow up. If they stay children, they become victims. Rose? What is it? Oh, my God, May. Rosie, darling, what..? Get Reggie back. Stop his honeymoon. Stop his honeymoon! Don't, love. Ron! Reg! It's funny, I don't miss anyone. Do you, Reg? Miss anyone? No. No one. Everything about you is different, you know that? How? I don't know, I can't explain it. Your skin feels different. Your body feels different. You even smell different. Well, you look the same. Just as beautiful. I want a photograph of us together like this. Okay? Yeah. Stay there. - Ready? - Come on! Smile. Reg? Wait there a sec. Yeah? What? No, keep him there. I wanna talk to him myself. What was that about? Bloody Jack the Hat. Gets on my tits. Gotta go. Listen, d'you want me to come? No, why don't you get out and talk to people, eh? - Give 'em that charming smile. - Bully. Fed up with Jack. He's a pain in the fucking neck! Don't take it out on me, it ain't my fault. Look at all your crap everywhere. There's pants in the bathroom, there's shoes everywhere... Tidy up after yourself! Everything's getting too damn messy. Just be grateful it's me you're dealing with, Jack, and not Ron. He'd have your guts for garters, you know that. You ripped us off, Jack! It was a mistake, Reg, really. I wouldn't do it, you know I wouldn't. Greg, Dick, come on, you know me. Oh, I know you all right. I wouldn't do it... Wait outside. I wouldn't... Just do it! He's been good in the past. Yeah, well, we'll watch him. He's scared. He knows we know. You can stay. But we're gonna be watchin' you. You've already got one foot in the grave, Jack. Don't jump in headfirst. I won't do anything, you know that. - Good lad. - How long we known each other? Pals, Reg! I hope so, Jack. - Right... - It's dealt with. - He's winding me up. - It's dealt with. You're in trouble, Jack! Go on. Shoulda done him, Reggie. - He's a ponce. - We've done all we had to. He's afraid, he ain't gonna rip us off again. Stupid bastards. You're not fooling anyone, Jack. Those bloody tablets of yours, they're turnin' your mind to jelly. All they'll do is dig you an early grave. Couple of bloody kids. I'd park those lips, Jack. They'll get you into big trouble. Oh, who from? I'm not afraid of the Krays. Pair of fucking freaks. We can live together. The Ripley Brothers. The Kray Brothers. We ain't got any argument. Yeah, that's true. We've never trodden on each other's toes. But there are others. Bloody Pellams and Cornell. I wouldn't worry about Cornell. Their torturer? Their what? I've seen what he can do, so's Chris. You can do no end of things with a pair of pliers. That's disgusting. How much of an influence is Cornell with the Pellams? He's an influence. He's got it in for you boys. It's just a personal thing, between me and Cornell. He's been calling me names. - Why does he hate you so much? - Bad chemistry. I lose track. Really, I do. How many clubs is it they've got now? Three? Young Charlie took me to the Regal the other night. You can take those gloves off now, darling. You'll stain them. Reg likes them, they go with the outfit. I'm sure he does, but Reg isn't here, so take them off, there's a good girl. I better get this tea up to those young men. They'll be gasping. They haven't stopped nattering since they've been there. We're expecting business from across the ocean. Soon you won't be able to throw a brick without hitting something of ours. It's getting too big to let the likes of Cornell get in our way. I mean he's a maggot... and we're big fish. - Big fish who own the ocean. - Open the door, please. Sit down, boys. Now, someone's trod in something, it's all up the hall. I don't mind who it is, but accidents will happen, would you mind checking? Ron? No. - Not me, Mrs. Kray. - Me neither. Nobody? Well, must be Frances. I'll go and ask her. How's your mother, Dickie? - Fine, thanks, Mrs. Kray. - Give her my love. - Knock on the floor if you want something. - Thanks, Mrs. Kray. Frances, I don't want to be a pest, but... Frances? Sorry. Look, darling, I'm gonna ask you something, and if you think I'm being an interfering old cow, just tell me, I'll shut up, but are you still taking those tablets? Don't get annoyed, darling. Reggie did tell me. Well, he had no right to, did he? I'm his mother. Reggie tells me everything. Well, no, I'm not taking any tablets. Well, is it Reg? No. Yeah, it's Reg. It's me. It's everything. I feel like I'm being taken over. I haven't got any strength. I dunno who I am. That's just called being married, darling. I don't believe that. Sometimes... Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I think, "How old am I? "What music do I like? What films do I like?" I don't know the answer any more. All I know is what Reg likes. What Reg likes me to like. Like... like these bloody gloves! Everyone's talking to me lately. Never knew I had so many friends. I think they find me a bit glamorous. That's exactly right, Dickie. - You know what that glamour is? - No? It's fear. I learnt that a long time ago. If people are afraid of you, you can just do anything. Glamour is fear. She looks really beautiful. Yes, she does. What's wrong with her? I don't think it's possible to love someone too much, but I think you can love them the wrong way. Oh, I don't know... Love... She's well looked after. I know, my darling, I know. She's just gotta start kicking, that's all, like I had to. I know Reg is my son, and God knows I love him, but she's just gotta start kicking. Pint of shandy, love. Well, well, well. All the pretty boys together, eh? Piss off, Cornell. How's your boyfriend lately? Still in tears over his auntie? You wanna watch your mouth. - Do what? - I said, you wanna watch your mouth. Poofs don't warn anyone, you listening? You tell your fat poof friend he doesn't scare me. He's bringing over his Yankee friends from America. Getting ideas a bit above his station, is he? Tell him, he can own all he likes, but he's still tied to his mother's apron strings. Okay? Eh? Good night, girls. You gonna tell Ron? Don't think I'll have to. Half the fucking pub heard. D'you want some sweets? No, I'm all right, thank you. They'll do you good. You're losing weight. I'll get you some. And your Woodbines, that's 13 and seven. How's it going, Reg? Mustn't grumble. A beautiful car. - Yourself? - About the same. How's your mum? She's fine. You know Mum. Here, I saw your Aunt May. She looks all right. I'll tell her. - No, it's all right. - Thanks. - What's goin' on? - Just lookin' at the car, mate. What about it? - I was admiring it. - You don't see many about. You lying bastards. You're not interested in the car. Reggie! Reggie! No! Please, no! Reggie! No! Don't! Please! Mr. Palendri. Good journey, Mr. Palendri? The flight was a nightmare. Please sit down. But England is a dream. I love London. It's so wonderfully dirty. And The Beatles, I adore The Beatles. You know The Beatles? - No. I believe they know us. - I'm sure they do. We know of you. The ocean is like a puddle in our business. News travels fast. What is that song now? My wife sings it all the time. Can't Buy Me Love. A great song... Money can't buy me love... Trouble is, it can. Money can buy you anything. Anything you like. It can buy... love, respect, loyalty, anything. It's wonderful being alive. The options have limited appeal. For you. We heard of your admiration for our reptilian brothers. It's beautiful. It's only the beginning. A mere bauble. This is for you. That's us with our mum. That's our Aunt Rose and our grandmother. And that's our Aunt May there. Yes, yes. You are all Cockernese? - Yeah. - Yeah, I think so. You've done very well. And this is only the beginning. Your family and my family, we shall do lots and lots of business together. To family. Family. Family! - It's Cornell. - Oh, what does he want? I thought he couldn't leave his coffin when the sun's up? Those Kray brothers are getting on my tits. - That'll be all, Miss Lane. - Sir? Excuse me. Cornell, it's amazing you can walk at all with your foot in your mouth so much. You seen this? Surprise us. What is it? Kray brothers. Splattered all over the papers. Bloody heroes, they are. This to charity, that to charity, the other to charity. - What does it matter? - What does it matter? You sit here in your little office, crushing cars into little snotballs. What does it matter? I'm out there earwigging it on the street and what I'm hearing is Kray, Kray, Kray, Kray, Kray! The pavement stinks with Kray. What are you saying, Cornell? You know damn well what I'm saying! Cornell, we've been through this a million times, the Krays are not interested in us. 'Course, they will be if you don't shut that megaphone of a voicebox. No, you don't know what they're saying about you. - They're saying things. - Things? What things? Things. I say shoot the bastards. Shoot them. What are they? A pair of bum boys! Let's put them out of their misery. A pair of movie gangsters! All they're interested in is what they look like. My life, they make me sick! They're a pair of locusts! You won't have a thing! You won't have the pants you're sitting in! Unless we do something now. They walk down the street like kings. King ponces! And you know why? They own the fucking street. So what I say is, bang, bang, all over. Nice one. Nice and sweet. Easy. End of aggro, eh? Treat me like bloody shit, shit on their shoes. Jack, do this, Jack, do that. I won't 'ave it, hear that? It's not right. I'm older than they are, eh? Bloody fucking kids. - D'you want one? - No, I fucking don't! Stuff your sweets! Always eating, like a dustbin. Give it a rest! - I like sweets. - "I like sweets"! You're fat, you know that? Won't go out with a fat cow like you. Give it a rest, Jack. I'm fat, you're bald. What's the difference? I'm not bald. I told you, I'm not fucking bald. Get on out! Fuck off! She'll never walk again, Reg. Her back was broken. Her mother depends on her, Ron. She's a cripple herself. You would think someone would do something. I mean, this man they say did it, this Jack somebody. I mean, you would think he was employed by somebody. And you would think this someone would feel responsible for what's happened, and... help out, eh? Well, wouldn't you? Yeah, you would, Aunt May. Yeah. They should make sure they're all right. The girl and her mother. Well, that's exactly what I was thinking. The least they should do. You know, make sure they're not short of money. Pay their rent. Of course. Of course. D'you like 'em? What does it mean, Reg? I don't understand? They're all for you. Every one of 'em. There's one for every night of the year. - But, Reg... - You don't like them. It's not that... You do like 'em, I do. That's it, you like them. You can't dress me like this, Reg. I've always bought my own clothes. But you don't have to any more. Have to? What d'you mean, have to? It's not a case of having to, I want to! You can't afford it and I can. I mean, I love giving you things. You are my bloody wife. I have to look after you. Anyway... it's not as if you've got money of your own, is it? That's right, I've got no money. So I'll get 'em. Oh, look. This one is really you, Fran. Don't you think so? Oh. You wear it tonight, and you'll be the prettiest thing there. Yeah? d Bittersweet, the taste of love d From a child's pretty finger d To the fist and the glove d Oh, bitter, bittersweet d Is the sound I hear d A dream to be free d And a need to be near d Love breaks each rule d And passion don't care d For bittersweet d Oh d Bittersweet d - That was lovely, Judy. - Thank you. You're in excellent voice tonight. Oh, thanks. Well, I croaked it in time, didn't I? Hi. Are you all right? You look like you need a drink. Oh, she's fine. - This is Iris. - That was great. - You look terrific. - And you. - How you doing, Ron? - Yeah, fine, Judy. Judy! One with the boys? Hello, boys! Duty calls. - Nice smile, Frances. - Come on, smile for me. - Come on, Frances. - Squeeze in together. Come on, Frances, come on, Judy. Reggie, they're coming downstairs. You missed the show. We've come to eat. - Sarah! - Fran! - All right, Ron? - Evening, Charles. You know Cornell. Yeah, we've heard of him. All right? All right? - He's a great fan. - Definitely. All right? You fill it better than me. - Yeah? - Reggie, it's the same dress. You look good. Don't she? All right, yeah. I let my wife choose her own dress tonight, hence the lapse in taste. Yeah? Yeah?! Shut it. When are you two getting married? You wanker. - Come on... - George. Just leave him, Ron. - Bye, Fran. - Bye, Sharon! See you! I'm gonna get Cornell. He's nothing. Ain't worth it, Ron. Piece of shit. Didn't know you knew Charlie Pellam's wife? - Yeah, we went to school together. - Yeah? Well, stay away. - Reggie, she's my friend. - Not any more she's not. - But, Reggie... - Just do it, Fran! For me, love! No arguments! Carrots, your cauli... Ah, what can I do for you today... - Hang on a moment... ...Mrs. Kray? Er, well, I've got this. Ta. How's Reg? Fine. - And Ron? - Yeah, fine. - And your mother? - My mother? Violet? Oh, yeah, my mother, I see. Here we are. I've slipped some of Reg's favorite salmon in. He likes red, eh? Er, how much..? Doh, don't worry about that. Just tell Reg I said hello. Thank you. Thank you. Come on! Come on! I just love snakes. They just relax me. They're beautiful, don't you think? Got lovely skin. Hello? No, it's Ron. What? I see. I know. D'you hear that, Reg? Pellam's been arrested. What about Cornell? No, he's still on the loose. Shouting his mouth off. Is he? And then there's Jack the Hat. Yeah. There's always Jack. - Sandwich, Reg? - Leave him. Yeah, but they're salmon. Shut it. D'you wanna drink, boys? Yeah, cheers. He's done it again. 2,000 this time. - 2,000? - Jesus, do the twins know? 'Course they know. They might not say anything, but they know. What is it with Jack? Has he got a death wish or something? They treat me like a fucking kid. I was here when their mother was still wiping shit from their arses... their arses! - All right, Jack, what's the matter with you? - Sit down and be quiet! You're all shit-scared, you're all shit-scared! Shut him up, will you? Ronnie! Reggie! I'm gonna get you. Stop it! Stop, please! - Fucking slut! - Oh! Come on. I'm not a-fucking-fraid of 'em! The Krays! The Krays! I'll kill the bastards! You've got a temperature. D'you want something to eat? Hmm? I'll put some of your favorite biscuits in a saucer. Oh, don't, Reg. Please. We all lose people, love. Part of living is losing. You've got to move on, darling. Don't, Reg. Mummy loves you. Mummy loves you. He's got to come to terms with it in his own way. Takes time. Time's a great healer. - You must speak to him, Mum. - I have been speaking to him. Do you think I sit up there and say nothing? D'you know, I keep on thinking about what your Aunt Rose said. About there being nothing under Victoria Park lake but bullets and babies. I often think about that. Bullets and babies. Just think of it. All those sad mothers. Sad mothers without their babies. When you were a child they took you away from me, remember? You were sick and they put you in hospital. You were there for weeks. It wasn't medicine you needed... it was Reg. You've got to make him fight this. It's up to you, my darling. It's crumbling, Reg. It's all falling apart. They're laughing at us now. Jack the Hat's been threatening us, he's walking round as proud as you like. Wavin' a gun! D'you hear me? They're saying you're through, Reg. You're over. We're over! Christ. Everything we've built. Worked for. They're saying there's nothing left, that we're... burnt up... falling. You know something? I think they're right. I said, I think they're right. I knew it was over when Frances came along. Forgot about me then, didn't you? About the firm, about everything we'd built up. I mean, you were in love so nothing else mattered. I didn't matter. You just split us in two. Fucking two. You were gonna leave me to do it by myself, yeah? Right then. If that's what you want. That's what we'll do, then. I'll get Cornell. I'll get Jack the Hat. You just sit there. Don't you lift a fucking finger. You just sit there and think about Frances, yeah? Well, this is over. She's dead and that's over! You bastard! Hit me, yeah? Hit me! Think that'll help it? Jesus Christ, there's an army of bastards out there screaming for our blood! Why don't we help them, eh? Let's kill each other! I'm so sorry. I know how you must feel. Don't use it to hurt me, eh? Don't give 'em all that satisfaction. We belong together. You know that. Like when we were kids, eh? Let's get 'em together. Let's get the bastards. As darkness consumed land after land, war became... attacked their homes, wives and children and disappeared into... marching towards the destiny that fate had chosen. These boys were... All right, sir? Ooh! Hello, Susie. Having a nice party? Well, you've gotta get everybody out. Quick as you can, eh? There's a good girl. We're having a meeting. Here's 20, go find another party. Okay, everyone! Okay! You've gotta go to another party! and childhood itself disappeared, like the sands of time... Reg. All right. We're gonna shoot off to that party. How's it going? Well, well, well. Mr. Kray. You haven't got the bottle. For the children, it was nothing more than an adventure, a violent playground, and instruments of survival were toys and playthings with which to amuse themselves. the destruction was enormous, a warfare that had never been seen before. And only those who lived through it could convey the sense of violence... You'll be all right. Come on. - Go on, down there. - After you, Claude. No... go on. All right? You all right? Let's have a party! - Ahh... - Now, Reggie! Ron! You miserable old bastard. It's your mouth, Jack. It's not what you've done. It's what you said you were gonna do. You've left us no choice, Jack! - What the fuck are you doing, Jack? - Bastard. Get up! Come on, Reg, do it now! - Be a man, Jack! - You don't have to kill me! You don't have to kill me! Yes, I do. You fuckin' bastard! Bastard! for mothers the evacuation was the worst... Bastard! You still up, Mum? Just looking at the screen. It gets hypnotic after a time. You should turn it off, Mum. It's finished. Shall I tell you my dream? I dreamt I was a beautiful white swan. And I could fly anywhere and do anything. And I had this egg. A beautiful egg, it was. And there were noises coming from inside the shell. And do you know what the noises were? They were... Now, listen carefully... They were... children's voices. And I looked after this egg and I kept it safe and warm. Until one day... there was a hatching sound, and out came... two boys. And they were mine. And they were wonderful. And they were perfect.
