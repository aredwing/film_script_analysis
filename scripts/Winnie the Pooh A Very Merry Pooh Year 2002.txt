Oh, yes, it is. Isn't it? Oh! Willy, nilly, silly old bear Ooh! MAN: [CHUCKLES] Well, it looks like you're all ready for Christmas. Oh, yes, as soon as my friends bring the decorations, we're having a tree trimming party and exchanging gifts. Oh! MAN: [CHUCKLES] What's that, Pooh? Well, it's a present for my very special friend Piglet, of course. Won't he be surprised? [GASPS] [SINGSONG] Pooh Bear! It's Piglet! MAN: Quick! Hide his present. PIGLET: Pooh Bear! Oh, dear. Oh, my. Oh, bother. - No one seems to be home. -Pooh? - Are you in there? -[GROANING] No. Well, maybe we've got the wrong house. [LAUGHS] Okay, maybe not. Oh, boy. [MOANS] For Pete's sake. What's all the commotion? Well, Pooh doesn't seem to be home. Well, that's silly. it's Christmas Eve, for crying out loud. -[POUNDING ON DOOR] -Oh, dear. Oh, boy. Perhaps? No. [GASPING] Oh, dear. Oh, my. Oh, bother. [FAINTLY] No. Pooh. open up! It's Christmas Eve! We've got presents! PIGLET: Pooh Bear! MAN: Hide his present. Well, well, well. Here's one I must have missed at lunch. - What is going on here? -I'm afraid I don't know. Why not just open the door and find out? Oh, no, we couldn't just... I mean, it wouldn't be... I... No, I don't think... [MUTTERING, COUGHING] Excellent idea, Roo. Oh, my- Now why doesn't this surprise me? Okay, everyone, let's get busy. Gifts here and decorations there. I say we deck the halls. Oh, what a beautiful tree. [STUTTERING] It certainly is a tall tree. - Wow! -Now be careful, Roo. That's delicate. Well, better late than never. Merry Christmas Eve, everyone. ALL: Merry Christmas Eve! [CHUCKLING] Merry Christmas Eve, indeed. Hello there, Pooh boy. I got the stuff for the tree. - I brought a star for the top. -Mmm... Perfect. All this excitement is getting me excited. [DOWNBEAT] I'm feelin' it. [LAUGHING] Mama and I made honey cookies. Did you say honey cookies? -Oof! -[LAUGHS] Yes, to hang on the tree, Pooh. Oh, may I have some? To hang on the tree, of course. Oh, yes. Now we must be careful not to tangle the garland, Eeyore. - Wouldn't want that. -Well, hello! It's a big ol' box of jingly bells! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Now this is what I call the holiday spirit. Time to bounce! [STUTTERING] Tigger, the garland. Be careful! Tigger! All this bouncing makes me feel... - Like bouncin' through the snow -In a one-horse open sleigh - O'er the fields we go -Laughin' all the way - Bells on Tigger ring -Making spirits bright - Pooh. -[GASPING] Oh, what fun to trim the tree With all my friends tonight - Oh... -Whoa! ALL: Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Spells bells. Oh, what fun it is to ride No improvisin', Rabbit. In a one-horse open sleigh, hey Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun to trim the tree with all my friends Tonight Mama, is Santa Claus coming soon? Why, of course he is, Roo dear. Well, abso-toodle-lutely. He did get our letter. That's right. Not like the Christmas he almost didn't. Oh, my. I almost forgot that story. And I thought Santa was gonna forget us. What happened? Well, it all started one windy winter's night. It was just a few days before Christmas. And naturally, we were all quite festive. You should have seen the wonderful snowfall. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING FADES] Hmm. Needs more salt. Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Hey. guys, wait for Tigger! CHRISTOPHER: Dear Santa. Well, guys, you've been awfully good this year. What kind of presents would you ask for? I'd like a new flyswatter to keep the bugs off my carrots. A flyswatter for... Christopher Robin, could Santa also bring Rabbit a small smackerel of honey? [CHUCKLES] Just in case certain guests drop in? - Eeyore? -Could use an umbrella to keep the snow off my house. Not that it matters if I don't get one. And a jar of honey for Eeyore, too. Think Sandy Claus will bring me a snowshoe for my tail? - I take a size four, triple E. -Now why would you want that? Allow me to demonsterate. Oh, yes. I see what you mean. Mmm-hmm. What about you, Piglet? [STUTTERING] Oh, dear. I really haven't been able to decide. Whatever Santa wants to bring is fine with me. Perhaps Piglet would also like a few pots of... Of honey? [LAUGHS] However did you guess? [GASPS] Wait, Christopher Robin, we almost forgot. What do you want for Christmas? All I want is a sled. One big enough for me and maybe a friend or two. That's it then. Next stop, the North Pole. ALL: Hooray! CHRISTOPHER: It's on its way! POOH: There it goes! [STUTTERING] Oh, dear. I do hope I'm not too late. Hello, Piglet. How do you like my Christmas tree? Oh, it's very nice, Pooh, but... I know. it seems as if I have forgotten, oh... Something. Yes, Pooh, you did. [CHUCKLING] Of course! It needs a present beneath it. But that's what I came to tell you, Pooh. When we wrote to Santa, you didn't ask for a present. - Oh, bother. -Whatever will we do, Pooh? We shall swoop from the sky and snatch the letter before Santa gets it. Are we ready to swoop yet, Piglet? Almost, Pooh. Are you sure this balloon can carry both of us? Oh, thank you, Pooh! [BOTH SHOUTING] Hey, look! Our letter to Santa. Not much of a stocking. Just right for not much of a house. [BOUNCING] Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Hiya, Eeyore. [GROANS] Sure could use that umbrella. Hope Santa brings it. Of course he will. We wrote a letter from the heart. Well, right now, he's probably readin' it, and his beady little eyes is welling up with tears. I bet you he's drowning in sorrows. We're talkin' Niagara Falls here. Tigger, would you have a pencil about you? A pencil, pencil, pencil... Oh! [LAUGHS] Nah. But I bet Rabbit has. [RABBIT HUMMING DECK THE HALLS] [LAUGHING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [ALL LAUGHING MALICIOUSLY] There! [KNOCK ON DOOR] [HUMMING DECK THE HALLS] How festive! Christmas carolers. [SHRIEKS] Charge! RABBIT: No, not my carrots! Get out! Take this! Take that! Take some of these! [SHRIEKS] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Out! Out! Out! [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS DEEPLY] [KNOCK ON DOOR] Not this time, you... Excuse us, Rabbit, could we borrow a pencil? Oh, it's only you. Hey, Long Ears, is that the kind of thing you want Sandy Claus to see? [GASPS] Quick! Help me decorate it again, or Santa might not bring my new flyswatter. Oh, he won't bring Pooh's present either if we can't borrow a pencil. Pencil, pencil. What present? Pooh never even asked for... [GASPS] Pooh, I forgot! You didn't ask Santa for a present. - I know. -Quick, the letter. - We've got to get it back. -I did. What are you waiting for? Put down a present for Pooh. - He can't. -Why not? You have the pencil, Rabbit. Right. Here. Now let me see. I believe what I wanted was a... Oh, no. I should really like to have a... - Or perhaps a... -Oh, just give him a pot of honey. Why, thank you, Rabbit. One pot of... You're welcome, Pooh. Since he's been so good this year, why don't you make it two pots of honey? Two pots of... Oh, Rabbit, you are indeed most generous. Is there something I could ask of Santa for you? Why, Pooh, how nice. Actually... Two flyswatters for Rabbit. - Two flyswatters. -RABBIT: Thank you. But I really have everything I've... [GASPS] Well, there is one thing. A sprayer that'll take care of those bugs forever. Been wanting one for years, but been afraid to ask. Then I shall ask for you. Piglet. Could we have one of, whatever those are, for our dear friend, Rabbit? Say, can I ask for something for somebody? Can I? Can I? Eeyore wants an umbrella for his house, but what he really needs is a new house. Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! No, two houses. Oh, split the difference. Make it a whole condominimum. - Well, thanks. -And four snowshoes for Tigger, so he can bounce six times higher. Say, I like this guy's mathematicals. RABBIT: No, spring-powered snowshoes so he can bounce halfway to the moon. Thanks, Rabbit. And ten pots of honey for Pooh. - Eleven. -it's the season of giving. Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! This is gonna be the bestest Christmas of all! Christmas? Oh, dear, what time is it? Half past the day before Christmas. -[RINGS] -ALL: The day before Christmas? Oh, my gosh! Quick! Quick! Get that to Sandy, hasty posty. - But aren't you coming with us? -With all the stuff we're getting, we gotta find a bigger tree to put it under. Is the wind pointing to the North Pole, Piglet? Uh... I'm not sure, Pooh. And I don't think the wind is sure either. I'm certain the letter knows its way. [GOPHER SNORING] [CLOCK TICKING] RABBIT: Gopher's not going to like this. Yeah, but if we was to let him hibernate through Christmas, he'd hate us in the morning. [ALARM BLARING] Suf... Sufferin' mistletoe! Can't a rodent get a little sleep around here? - Yeah, but, Gopher, we need your help. -Got a big job for ya. [MOANING] Come back in the spring. - But this is for Santa Claus. -Sandy Claus? [HAMMERING] [MOANING] All I gotta say is old Saint Nick better appreciate this. [GROANING] Tell me where you want it! Tell me where you want it! - Over here. -Thataway. - To your left. -Right. - Your other right. -This way! Over there. Keep going. Keep going. RABBIT: Here's a perfect place. TIGGER: Over here! RABBIT: Think that's the best spot? TIGGER: Okay, okay, there! [GRUNTS] BOTH: Perfect! See you in the morning, Piglet. [CHUCKLES] - Christmas morning. -Pooh, look! [MOANING] Tra-la-la-la-la-la... La-la-la. Oh! Santa will be so happy. This is going to be the most wonderful Christmas ever. [CHUCKLES] Oh, bother. PIGLET: [GASPS] Our letter to Santa. Yes, it must have followed me home. For when I got there, so was it. But Pooh, tomorrow's Christmas. I didn't even know what I wanted, and now I'm sure not to get it. I'm sorry, Piglet. But I'm sure it would have been wonderful. Oh, no, what about Tigger's gift? And Rabbit's? And... Christopher Robin's sled! Piglet, we are going to find a way to bring Christmas to everyone, or my name isn't Winnie the Pooh. Which it is. [SNORING] [MUTTERING] [CHUCKLING] You're supposed to be asleep when Sandy Claus comes, you know. [GROWLING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] [GASPS] Who could that possibly be at this time of night? [LAUGHING] As if I didn't know. Ho, ho, ho? Gasp! Sandy Claus! Yep, that's him. Though I always thought he was taller. POOH: Um... It's awfully cold out here in the cold. - If I could come in? -Why, sure you... Hey, wait a minute! Isn't Sandy Claus supposed to come down the chimney? Oh... [CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY] Oh, bother! [STRAINING] [SINGSONG] Ooh! Sandy Claus is coming down my chimney! Sandy Claus is coming down my chimney! [GRUNTS] Here. Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Presents is what Tiggers like best! Oh, thanks, Sandy. Uh... Uh... Sandy? [MUTTERING] [STRAINING] Need a little help, huh? Hey, anything for old Saint Nick. - A-one, a-two, a-fire! -POOH: Merry Christmas! Come back any time. Oh, boy, my super-duper bouncer! Hey, I can bounce in the snow! What a present! Just what I always wanted! Definitely not what I always wanted. [CACKLING] Yes, make yourselves at home. What's mine is yours... tonight. Until I get my present from Santa Claus. [RATTLING] Oh, my! It's him! [POOH STRAINING] POOH: Oh, bother! Santa Claus? But why isn't he coming down the... Ho, ho, ho! Uh... Here. [GRUNTING] Funny, I always thought he'd be taller. On, Donner! On, Blitzen! On, Armchair, [CHUCKLES] and everyone else. Bugs, prepare to meet your muncher! ALL: Uh-Oh! [CACKLING] [WHIMPERING] -[TEAPOT RATTLING] -Uh-oh. [LAUGHING] [YELPING] No, no! Help! [THUDDING] [CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Hiya, bunny boy. Did you see Sandy Claus come this way? Yes, and look what he brought me for Christmas. - Yeah. Kinda know the feeling. -EEYORE: Hey! Hark, the sound of a donkey in distress. Something tells me Sandy must have been here. But Santa was supposed to bring you a new home. He did. A mobile home. Come on! We've got to stop Santa before he delivers again. [PIGLET GROANING] Just think, Piglet, all we need to do is give Christopher Robin this sled and all the Christmas presents will be present. Look! There he is! - Sandy Claus! -RABBIT: If that's really who you are. Always thought he'd be taller. But of course I'm Santa Claus. I have the hat, don't I? - He does, you know. -And the boots. Why, I even have the sled. So I suppose I must be Santa Claus. Hmm... Got a point there. Although that's a pretty sorry-looking reindeer. If you really are Santa, let's see you and your reindeer fly. Fly? Well, we... [MURMURING, STUTTERING] If you insist. On, Lawn Chair! On, Badminton! UP. up and away! - Whoa! -Oh, bother! [ALL SCREAMING] [CRASHING] [GASPS] Looky! That's no Sandy Claus! That's a Pooh! Ho, ho... Ho. [RABBIT CLEARS THROAT] Pooh Bear, which way was the wind blowing when you tried to send our letter? Why, to the S. Towards Santa. S is for south! Santa lives at the North Pole! [CHUCKLES] on. [STUTTERING] Oh, dear. Perhaps we have too little wind for so much letter. What do you know? [CHUCKLES] Fresh out of breeze. - How will it get to the North Pole? -Someone must take it there himself. Um... Uh... Which one of us himselves did you have in mind? Me. You? But the North Pole is so very far. What if you can't get back in time for Christmas? It will be worth having no Christmas, Piglet, if I can bring Christmas to all of you. Oh, Pooh. What a pal! What a friend! What a bear and a half! While you're there, could you put in a good word -with the big guy in red for me? -[SNIFFLING] Goodbye, Pooh. Goodbye, everyone. And Merry Christmas. Please, come back! I'm supposed to take you to Santa! Oh, boy, this Christmas is gonna go down in history. Yes, as the first one we've spent without Pooh. But think of all the neat stuff we're gettin'. [SNIFFLING] Oh, come on, Piglet, old pal. Look at us. We're happy. Where's your Christmas spirit? What's Christmas if your best friend isn't here to share it? I don't even know what present I wanted, but I'd give it up to have Pooh Bear here. - You know, so would I. -Me, too. If only... If only we had him back. POOH: Hello! Hello! Pooh Bear! Hooray! Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my, you're back! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Hooray. How wonderful. But I didn't get the letter to the North Pole. You aren't going to get any presents. As long as we've got you, we don't need any presents. [BELLS JINGLING] If that's another one of them phony Sandys, I'm gonna nail him. Merry Christmas! Look what Santa left for you. [LAUGHING] Here you go. Look! A flyswatter. Just what I've always wanted. [CACKLING] Wait till those bugs see this. Hey, I can bounce on the snow! Look at me! No hands! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! It works. Didn't expect it to, but I'm kinda glad. Oh, my! I don't know what it is, but I think it's wonderful. Aren't you gonna open your present, Pooh? But I forgot to ask for what I wanted, and then I went to get the letter back. And then I never did get it to the North Pole, and then I, well... Christopher Robin, I don't deserve this. I don't deserve anything. But Pooh, Santa brought it for you. Which was awfully nice, but, you know, I think being with your friends is nicer. Though this would be the perfect... The perfect what? The perfect Merry Christmas height for this. Silly old bear. [CHUCKLING] And so you see, Roo, everything turned out wonderfully. [YAWNING] What a great story. I just love a happy ending. That's the special thing about the holidays, dear. Our memories are the real gift of Christmas. Excuse me. Did someone mention gifts? Yay! Let me help you there, Pooh boy. I'll be Santa Pooh's little helper. This one's for you, and this one is for you. And this one's for you, and this one is... Hold on there. - This one's for me. Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! -Why, Piglet, [GASPS] you shouldn't have. - Oh, I just love it! -Wow! Merry Christmas Eve to one and all! MAN: And, as it so often happens following Christmas Eve, the next morning was Christmas. Yippee! MAN: Everyone went out to share their new treasures and celebrate the joy of Christmas together. - Thanks for the sled, Tigger! -Glad you like it, Roo boy! Whoo! [LAUGHS] This is fun! [LAUGHS] oh! Yes, it's wonderful! Snow! Yee-ha! Snow snows on my eyes My ears, my toes I suppose it even froze my nose Snowflake melting like a honey cake Snow drop One, two, three, ker-plop Snow snows on my eyes My ears, my toes I suppose it even froze my nose All right! [ALL LAUGHING] Well, when you two decide to warm up a bit, we'll have a nice toasty fire for you. Okay, Eeyore, you take this load back now, and I'll continue to gather. Don't dawdle. Now this is what I call holiday fun. - TIGGER: How you doin', donkey boy? -[BELLS JINGLING] Oh, no. It's Tigger and those dreaded bells. Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [GASPS] Phew! That was a close one. Tigger has just lost control with those bells. Who we hidin' from, Rah-Rah? [GASPING] Why me? Ooh! Don't tell me you're losin' the holiday spirit already, Long Ears? - No, no. -Good. 'Cause I know just what you need. It's jingly bells! Jingly bells, jingly bells What a joy to see A million zillion jingly bells beneath my Christmas tree, hey Jingly bells, jingly bells Sing along and see How much fun the bells can be when you ding-a-ling with me Give me those bells! You know what? I think having these bells will help my holiday spirit. That's the spirit, Rabbit. Just take those bells and have a great time! - Don't forget to shake 'em! -Oh, don't worry. I will. I will. Ooh... Matching breakfast, lunch and dinner honey pots. How did you know? What a wonderful gift. Thank you, my very dear friend, Piglet. [CHUCKLES] Oh... You're very welcome, Pooh. [SMACKING] And, um... How did you like my gift to you? Well, Pooh, this particular Christmas, you didn't give me a gift. [CHUCKLES] Mmm... You're welcome... I didn't? Now how could that be? Perhaps you forgot? How could I ever forget something as important as... [GASPS] Your Christmas present! Oh, um... Wait right here, Piglet. [STUTTERING] Well, all right, Pooh. But it's really... MAN: Pooh looked and looked for Piglet's present. He looked and he looked, and he looked again. And when he wasn't looking, he searched instead. But, alas, for poor Pooh, everywhere he looked and searched was still somewhere where it wasn't. Pooh looked from Christmas Day all the way to New Year's Eve, until he quite forgot what he was searching for in the first place. What? - CHRISTOPHER: Pooh Bear! -Um... Christopher? CHRISTOPHER: Pooh? POOH: Christopher! Pooh Bear! [GRUNTING] Christopher Robin? Christopher? [GIGGLING] - Oh, my goodness! -Happy New Year! - It is? -Well, almost. It's New Year's Eve. - So tonight we're having a party. -[GASPS] A party? And we'll make our New Year's resolutions. Reso-whotions? [WHISTLE BLOWING] - POOH: Bother. Resolutions, Pooh. It's when you promise to do something you've never done, or not do something you used to do. It's a promise to be a better person in the new year. POOH: Hmm... Resolutions. And something sweet. That does sound like a party to me. So where, may I ask, is this party to be? Anywhere our friends are together, Pooh. Well, in that case, I know just the place, Rabbit's house. He certainly is a friend. Not to mention, he always has a smackerel or three, and I never mind sharing one with me. It would only be proper to ask first, Pooh. You're right, Christopher. I shall stop by Rabbit's house before I invite all the others to Rabbit's house. [LAUGHS] Happy New Year, Pooh. See you at the party. Happy New Year, Pooh Happy Pooh Year New Hope it's sweet and sunny like a pot of honey For a Pooh Year treat Friends will meet and greet In the New Year Pooh Year, too [RABBIT HUMMING] [CHUCKLING] There. Now that's a happy little carrot plant. My, my, Rabbit. I didn't know you could grow carrots indoors. Well, it's something only rabbits know. Every year, I bring in the last carrot of the summer... There, there... I feed it, water it and read to it all winter long, as recommended, of course, in this official carrot-growing instruction manual. Then, in the spring, I use it to start my garden all over again. - Hello, little fella. -Yes. That's it. Keep talking to it, Piglet, while I get the plant food. Carrot plants love to be talked to. -[POUNDING ON DOOR] -Ooh! [STUTTERING] Oh, dear. What do you suppose that might be? [POUNDING CONTINUES] Oh, dear. Whatever shall we do? Hello? Hello? PIGLET: [STUTTERING] Hello? My tummy's always asking for honey. But this is the first time that the honey has answered. [TOY BLOWS] [GASPS] Oh! My carrot! [RATTLING] Pooh, what are you doing in there? Well, your honey invited me in. Naturally, I didn't want to appear unfriendly, Rabbit. - Neither did my tummy. -Your tummy? Is that all you ever think about? Well? [SMACKING] I'm trying to remember. Where's my carrot? And where's Piglet? [PIGLET STUTTERING THEN SNEEZING] BOTH: Bless you. PIGLET: [SNIFFLING] Thank you. Piglet, what are you doing under there? We both got very scared, and I wasn't sure of what to do. So I thought this might be a good place for, uh, not being sure. Must you be afraid of everything, Piglet? - Well, I suppose that depends... -[POUNDING ON DOOR] ...on how frightening it is! Now what? Who's there? Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Hiya, Rabbit. Wanna hear the good news? Snow does not keep Tiggers from bouncin'. Not one bitty bit. [STRAINING] Get off me, Tigger! - Eeyore. -Thanks for noticin'. What are you doing under there, besides being sad and gloomy? Not much. As usual. Hey, Long Ears. Want to see what else Tiggers can do? [FANFARE PLAYS] They can throw a snowball and catch it themselves. First, the windup. Then, the toss! And now, the most Tiggerific part, the catch. [LAUGHS] -[SHATTERS] -Oopsy! [MOANING] My carrot! Thank goodness you're okay. Tigger, there is such a thing as being excessively bouncy, you know. Why, thanks, Long Ears. That means a lot to me. Ooh... Happy New Year, Tigger. Welcome to the party. - Party? -Party? Well, thanks for invitin' me. Here, let me help. - Partyin' is what Tiggers like best. -What party? Why, the one we're having at your house, of course. I did mention that, right, Rabbit? - What? -Is that a no, Rabbit? Come on, Long Ears. I'll help you decorate. The place sure could use it. [ALL YELLING] - Piglet, watch out! -TIGGER: Follow me, buddy. Tigger! - Oh, bother. -RABBIT: Piglet, save the carrot! It figures. [ALL SHOUTING] The party always starts without me. Don't be ridicurous. Why, this party just got rollin'. Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! That's it. That does it. Out! Out! Everybody, out! Out! I've had it! My carrot will never make it through the new year with all of you around! And neither will I! We are both leaving! ALL: Leaving? - You mean going away? -Wherever will you go? Ooh... Someplace where there are no honey-munching Pooh Bears, no petrified Piglets, no gloomy donkeys and no always-bouncing Tiggers! Sheesh. The brain boggles. What kind of place would that be? Paradise! Rabbit gone? What will we do without him? We could have the party at your house, I suppose. I know you're thinkin' it's gonna be a little cramped. But since there is gonna be -one less of us... -[STUTTERS] Oh, dear. Pooh, isn't there something we can do to make Rabbit stay? Think, think. Think. Perhaps, since Rabbit isn't happy with the way we are, he might be happier with some way we aren't. You mean if we were different? No longer our warm, fuzzy selves? - No more bundles of joy? -Oh, my. We could all change. We could all make a resolution. - A restitution? -A resolution, Tigger. It's something Christopher Robin told me. It's a promise that you make to yourself to change. [STUTTERING] Uh... Change? Well, if it means Rabbit won't move away, then I'm ready to change. - Me, too. -Me three. Well, I doubt it will help, but count me in. I promise not to eat honey ever again. - Who said that? -Pooh Bear. You don't know what you're sayin'. If you can do it, Pooh, so can I. I promise not to be afraid anymore. Ooh! Piglet! What has come over you? Oh, well. Things can't get any worse than they are now. I promise to be so cheerful, you won't even know it's me. Neither will I. [GULPS] Stickin' with their pals is what Tiggers do best. So I hereby and hinter forth promise to never bounce another bounce. You got my word. This Tigger's high-hoppin' days are history. That spring-sprong in my step is gone! - POOH: Tigger? -Nevermore will I... - Nevermore... -POOH: Tigger? What? Oh, yeah. That's gonna be tougher than I thought. But don't worry. Tiggers always stick to their rustytutions. Stick? As in sticky? As in honey? MAN: And so Pooh's friends, trying to please Rabbit, found themselves in a bit of a jam. Jam? As in honey? MAN: If Pooh can't eat honey, Piglet can't be afraid, Tigger can't bounce and Eeyore can't be gloomy, then the question is... What do we do now? TIGGER: Ankles away! [GRUNTS] Oh, dear. Tigger, are you all right? Why, sure. This is my tiggerific way of not bouncin'. See? I... [GRUNTS] That's good. I was afraid you were hurt. Oh, I did it again. Said I was afraid. Tigger, you're never afraid, are you? I guess I was too busy bouncin' to ever think about it. So that means if I bounce, I won't be afraid? Why, it works for me. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Well, at least it used to, back in my bouncin' days. [CHUCKLING] Look, Tigger! I'm bouncing! I'm bouncing! Now I won't be afraid of anything! Thank you, Tigger! Thank you! Oh... How about that? I guess bouncin' does keep you from bein' afraid. Look at the little guy. He's... But that would mean that not bouncin' might make a fella sort of squeamish, even a tad trembly. Just around the edges. Not to mention teetering [OBJECT CREAKING] on the brink of terror. [OBJECT SNAPPING] Oh, dear. Double oh, dear. What's that? Ooh! It's got me! [SCREAMING] [THUDDING] POOH: [SINGSONG] Hmm, I'm not eating honey. Not even thinking of thinking of thinking of eating honey. I'm not. I'm simply making sure that the honey is safe. [HUMMING] Why, hello, Pooh Bear. Whatever are you looking for? Oh! Well, I certainly wasn't looking for... ...honey. -Well, that's fortunate. Because I just discovered the last little honey pot, much to my delight. I couldn't be happier for you. Even if I could be happier... for you. [SIGHS DEEPLY] No honey. -[HUMMING] -POOH: No hope of any honey. Not even any hope of any hope of any honey. Pooh Bear, I have this funny feelin'. Whatever could it be? -[SMACKS] -I'm sure I wouldn't know. Think, think, think. Why, I believe it's the honey that gives me this funny feelin' and stops the rumbly in my tumbly as well. I'm glad. At least, I think I'm glad. I'm not sure how glad feels. But if I... Why, that's it, Pooh. I think I'm glad. See? [HUMMING] POOH: Honey No, not for me A honey, humming honeybee Would not even want to see Or be with me With honey Ooh... "Restful Acres. "Quiet, secluded and peaceful living." You see, little fellow, it'll be wonderful. [CHUCKLES] And I'm sure we'll make lots of new, quieter friends. There we are. [CHUCKLES] All ready to go. -[KNOCK ON DOOR] -Now what? - Hello. -Eeyore? Might you happen to have a little bit of a teeny taste of a small smackerel of something? And perhaps that somethin' might be sweet? I... But... Uh... TIGGER: [STUTTERING] Dear! Oh, help! Save me, Rabbit! Save me! He's after me! He chased me here, and he chased me there and all the way back here again. [SHOUTS] Here he comes! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Hello, Rabbit. I mean... Hiya, Long Ears. [CHUCKLES] Piglet? What are you doing? What piglets do best, bouncin'! [STAMMERING] What's going on here? Why are you all so... ...different. [OBJECT THUDDING] - Pooh Bear? -Thanks for noticin'. [CHORTLING] Help! Oh, help! - It's got me! -You're gettin' a little low on honey. I'm not happy about this. I know the feelin'. TIGGER: [STUTTERING] I don't think he'll find me here. EEYORE: Would you like somethin' sweet while you're waitin'? [SCREAMING] What are you... Please! You mustn't... If you would only... Stop! [ALL SCREECHING TO A HALT] I don't know what's going on, but it's even worse than before. Now I'm definitely leaving. Goodbye! [STUTTERING] Oh, dear. What could be wrong? - We're tryin' to be different. -Not workin' too well, is it? There, there. You see, little fellow? Never a quiet moment. Well, from now on, our lives will be calm and serene and... [SHOUTS] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh! [EXHALES] Oh, that... That was a close one. [OBJECT WHIZZING] [YELLING] We just have to find Rabbit. Maybe we will. Probably we won't. We'll show him how much we've changed. I miss him already. RABBIT: Help! Piglet! Pooh! - Up here! -Look! It's bunny boy! - Help! -Oh, dear! I'm bouncing, but I'm still afraid. Help! I'm being beenapped! [SHIVERING] New Year's restitution or no, it's time to do what Tiggers do best. Don't worry, Long Ears! I'll save ya! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Hiya, buddy boy. Back in a flash. Hang onto that, would you, Piglet, old pal? - Oh! -Ooh... Ta-da! [LAUGHS] Where's my carrot? What did you do with my... Oh-ho-ho! There you are! Safe and sound. Rabbit's back. And everything is simply... Oh! Mmm... Oh! [CHUCKLES] Simply wonderful. Oh, bother. I just broke my resolution. I bounced mine into itty-bitty pieces, too. Oh, dear. I was so afraid for Rabbit, I didn't keep my promise either. Well, it's unanimous. I was so upset, I forgot to be happy. I suppose that means... [SIGHS] ...goodbye, Rabbit. Wait a minute. What are you talking about? Well, our New Year's resolutions, of course. We tried to change for you. Hello! Happy New Year! Is everybody ready for the party? We're ready, all right, for the world's worst New Year's party. Whatever do you mean? It will be a new year, but without our old friend. Our dear friend. Our former friend. That paragon of bunnydom. -[SNIFFLING] Rabbit. -Rabbit's leaving? - I know! -Leaving? Me? Now why would I want to leave friends who are so loyal they would change just to please me? But we didn't change. We tried, Rabbit, but we just stayed our same old selves. And thank goodness for that. Why, what kind of a Pooh Bear would you be if you didn't like honey? [STOMACH GRUMBLING] A very hungry one. And a Tigger who doesn't bounce really isn't a tigger at all. You're not just sayin' that to mend our broken hearts, are ya? - Well, are ya? -Oh, and Eeyore. This Pooh shirt was too itchy, even for me. - And little Piglet. -Oh, Rabbit. I was afraid I'd never get to be scared again. There, there. You can hide under my bed whenever you want. That Rabbit. He just gives and gives. Please don't change. I like all of you just the way you are. I am the one who needs to change. But Rabbit, if you weren't you, then we'd all be a bit less, um... we. Exactly, Pooh. That's what friends do for each other. They help you to be more of who you are. Now come on, everyone. It's time to celebrate the new year. Oh, at my house, of course. CHRISTOPHER: Five, four, three, two, one! - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! Quiet, everyone! Christopher Robin has something to say. - I'd like to make a toast. -I love toast! Have you tried it with honey? Delicious. Here's to the happiest of new years, to all my wonderful friends. Let's all raise a cup to ring in the new year. - TIGGER: Hey! -Happy New Year! I believe these are yours, Tigger. - I'm very sorry if I... -That's okay, Rah-Rah. Let's just let bygones be gone. The important thing is that we're pals forever. Am I right? Absitutely, old friend. You see? Nothing brings friends together like bells. How true, how true. And I think that calls for... [CHUCKLING] One more round of Jingly Bells? Oh, look at you. Jingly bells, jingly bells On a New Year's Eve And I'm so glad to be right here That I may never leave Take it, Rah-Rah. Jingly bells, jingly bells To old friends, everyone We give to you our gratitude For good times, joy and fun [ALL LAUGH] Isn't this a great gang of friends? They sure are, aren't they? Who would have thought those two could make such wonderful music together? Oh, yes. Music is a special gift. -[GASPS] Piglet! -What is it, Pooh? Your gift! I remember your gift! I shall be right back, Piglet. [CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [OBJECTS CRASHING] [POOH SHOUTING WITH GLEE] Oh! [GRUNTS] I've got it! This is for you. Oh... Honey. Thanks, Pooh, but you really shouldn't have... Merry Christmas to my very best friend, Piglet. [UP-TEMPO MUSIC CHIMES] And... Let all your holidays be bright And very merry, too I wish you all a great New Year [GROANS] [GASPS] And lots of honey, too Ooh... Thank you, Pooh. That was wonderful. But the very best gift of all is your friendship. - My, my. -Oh, how sweet. Sweet, but a little sappy, if you ask me. Not bad, but it could have used a few more jingly bells. [LAUGHS] [ALL LAUGHING] Should old acquaintance be forgot And never brought to mind Should old acquaintance be forgot And days of auld Iang syne For auld Iang syne, my dear For auld Iang syne We'll take a cup of kindness yet For auld Iang syne WOMAN: In The Hundred Acre Wood We gather round with friends And pass the cup of honey round Until the old year ends Did someone say honey? WOMAN: For auld Iang syne, my friends For auld Iang syne We'll pass the cup of honey round For auld lang syne
