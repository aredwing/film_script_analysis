You could use an apprentice, couldn't ya, Stank? - You cannot find good help these days. - That's right.

You're gonna all go straight to hell! Howdy. You don't look so good. I said you don't look so good, honey. Do I know you? No, you don't. But I know you. Everybody around here does. You're Norma, the trailer-park queen. Least, that's what all the boys say. - Get out of my way! - You see, a girl like you grows up with nothing, probably ain't gonna be nothing. - It's just the natural order of things. - What do you know? A lot. I know a lot. I been around a long time, and I've seen a lot of things. And it ain't your fault, child. Yeah? Well, whose fault is it then? It's their fault. There's people holding you down, kicking you, keeping you on their level, taking away everything you ever had and everything you ever wanted. How do you know about that? Listen to me. Do you want to get even with everybody, with this shit, with the world? If you want to get even, you gotta start now. You see, I always say, "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned." Or one that's been shit on all her life. You know, the weaker ones among us would have you believe that violence never pays. I am not one of those people. I say therein lies salvation and eternal gratitude. Now, do we have a deal? We have a deal. Norma. No! No! Let's all get outta here now! Born into this life, thought I was free But they held on like demons Never let me be So come to me, Satan Come take me, please I've lived, I'm done I'm tired as can be All right, people, let's go. Make it quick. Jesus! Hey, y'all. My name is Bridget, and I'm a quitter. No. Actually, I guess, I never quit anything in my life. That's why Mommy and Daddy sent me to Jesus camp. - Fuck you, Alex. - I was abused as a kid. So that means I can do whatever I want and just shit on everybody else. - No, you don't know anything about me. - Oh, yeah. That's right, Goth bitch. Like I don't know you turned to a liar to save your own ass! But then I guess God just decided I needed another challenge. Thank you, God. Thou shalt be teamed with a... - What do you fucking want? - Do you ever take a break, - or are you always like this? - I can take care of myself, okay, Michael? I'm always like this. - Yeah. You don't think it's sad? I'll tell you what, computer boy. If I smacked your geek head to the ground, and then kicked your fucking face in until your whole goddamn queer body stopped moving, - that would be sad. - Yeah. Hey, that's enough! Amber, you got something you wanna add to the conversation? Respect, people! - Stop staring at my ass, Jason. - No, I wasn't. I don't know anything about your ass. Whoa, whoa! Yo, Twinkie. Haven't you noticed in the time you've been here that, that one's taken? - Hey, people! - You got that? - Yeah. - Bathroom, soda, snacks. Hey, hey. Hey! Get inside. We gotta get back on that bus. There's a storm coming. Come on. Officer. How are you? Just running hauls up in Cincinnati... - Yeah. I don't know why he wanted to take that run. Please be advised, a line of severe thunderstorms are moving across middle Tennessee, northern Alabama and Georgia. These storms are associated with strong upper-level cold pressure systems... Vertical Trinity. What's that about? Dragging us up to the mountains and trying to save our souls. Something like that. Hope you plan on buying those snacks, son. Yes, ma'am, he does. Hey, pay the lady. a severe storm warning for the Tri-State area. Travelers are well advised to seek shelter. This is a dangerous storm accompanied by heavy rain, high winds and a strong possibility of tornadoes. We are now getting reports of flooding and landslides on Highway 24, and the highway patrol has closed the route until further notice. Just great. Travelers, please be advised, a line of severe thunderstorms are moving across middle Tennessee, northern Alabama and Georgia. That's some bunch of hell raisers you got there, mister. They're not as tough as they like to pretend. Nothing a good crack upside the head wouldn't straighten out, huh? No, no. At Vertical Trinity, we don't believe violence is appropriate discipline. These are decent kids, they really are. They just need a little guidance, that's all. I think what he's trying to say is that we're fuck-ups. Language? Start rounding up the others for me, will you please, Bridget? We're all about faith intervention. By challenging these kids' limitations and negative self-images, we show them there's nothing they can't do without faith and God's help. Tell you what, while you keep on believing, how about you reach in your wallet and count me out the 20 bucks for the porno rags your little angel lifted? - They're really not bad kids. - Yeah, and sometimes when I turn my head just a certain direction, I kinda think I look like Julia Roberts. That ain't really worth a whole hell of a lot in the rest of the world now, is it? I guess not. Let's see here. I think I can take this bypass here. - You ain't serious? - Why wouldn't I be? That there road's hell in a storm. And it ain't even real good in the broad daylight, neither. - He ain't from around here, is he? - About 8 miles, the road comes to a "T," you wanna take a left, and that'll take you up to the bypass. All right, hey! You two got about A full five more than you need, right, minute man? - Excuse you, Goth whore. - Well, there's no excuse for you. Hey, let's get a move on, troops... - You know you want this. - Yeah. Like leprosy. I got her! Hey, Tiff! Hey, Tiff. Hey! What are you... Do you know what I had to do to get this? I think I have an idea. I finally get some shit, and you dump it all over the ground? Jesus, Tiffany. Did you not get anything out of this past week? Yeah. A serious crave. But thanks for helping me with that, mom. You know what? The bus is leaving. Let's go. Come on. - Now. - Fuck! - Now. - Man! Jesus, this sucks! Yeah. Do it. Do it. Do it. Hey, yo, Pastor. We there yet? For real, though. I just wanted to thank you for this past week, man. It was enlightening. No, really. I think you worked miracles, man. In fact, you got a whole bus full of them. But, no, seriously, though. I'm seeing big changes, Pastor. Big changes. I mean, take my man Michael here. I mean, I think the dude's actually starting to notice girls. Yeah. Tiffany, I think she's just gonna stick to smoking dope now, instead of scoring the hard shit all the time. Jason, he's laughing, man, 'cause he knows he's changed. He's downgraded his shoplifting just to soft-core porn now. Which is good, 'cause the amount he whacks off, he'll be blind within a year. And my girl Bridget, yo, her days of five guys all at once, they're done. She's just strictly a threesome kinda girl now. Man. Her days of telling tall tales about her messed-up childhood? Done. No more! Take my old girl Amber. I guess there's just some people you can't save, you know what I mean? - You know what, Alex? This is a process... - Look out! Jesus Christ. Everybody all right? Anybody hurt? My head. My... - Oh, fuck! - Anybody have a signal? - Looks like a dead zone. - Nothing. - There's no keys, nothing! - Oh, God. - I don't get it. - Who leaves a truck - in the middle of the damn road? - It's fucking weird, if you ask me. Yeah, it is fucking weird. I guess we'll bow to your expertise in that department. - Fuck you! - Hey, there's a sign! What? - "Trailer park." Let's go check it out. - Dude, look at the sign! - What? - The thing is probably long gone by now. - Let's go. Follow me. Come on. No! - Oh, yeah. That's a great idea. We're stranded in a thunderstorm, everybody head for the trailer park. There won't be any freaks there. But if there are, at least we have the Lord on our side. Hey, don't you think someone should stay with the bus? Bridget, wait up. Come on, baby. Catch up. Hey, there's a light! - Hurry up. I cannot believe someone actually lives here. Come on, guys. Come on, let's get out of the rain now. You two. Hey, come on. Hello? Anybody home? Hello? Hello? We've had an accident. We just need a phone. Oh, ma'am. Ma'am, we didn't mean to barge in, ma'am. A man in my home. - This is really awkward. - And me still putting my face on. Children? Goodness, children! Oh, where are my frigging manners? Come on in. Sit! Sit. Sit, sit, sit! Okay, I'm just gonna put my face on. I'll be right back. - If we could just use the phone. - Phone? Why would I have a phone? I still think somebody should have stayed with the bus. Let's just relax. This woman might be able to help us. How is she going to help us if she doesn't have a phone? Maybe she has a car. Yeah. Maybe she's got a private jet out back on blocks, too. Alex, that's not helpful. Maybe she got some ponies we can all ride, one for each of us. - Wouldn't that be fun? - That would be nice. Oh, shit! Those are some fucking ponies. - Alex. Stop it. Sweet tea? You didn't have to do that for us. Thank you. Oh, it's nothing. Come on. Thank you. - Oh, you're welcome. - Thank you. - Precious, precious darlings. Thank you. - I'm Norma. - I'm Pastor Lewis. We had a little accident up there in the rain. We're with the Vertical Trinity Ministries. - That's nice. - This is swell and all, but I think we should be getting back to our bus. Let me know if you all want yours a little harder. - This better? - Yeah. - Look, ma'am... - Norma, darling. - We could really use some help. - If y'all are looking for help, you came to the right place. Jesus! - Great. Now, just calm down. - Hold on. This always happens. Don't worry about it. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be okay, Tiffany, all right? - It's gonna be fine. - Let's tell a scary story. Great. Come on. I love a scary story. Come on, who's got one? I know one of you has got one. How about you, pepper pot? No? Dark shadows, what about you? Hell, you already look like one of the devil's daughters. - I know you got a scary story. - I don't. I'm sorry. Nothing. - What about you, cupcake? - No. Come on, lady, look at her. She is a scary story. Screw you, Alex. You're so fucking twisted. Wrong again, Tiffany. That would be your last name. - Let's knock it off, people. - What about her? Why don't you tell us her story? Well, every picture has one, right? Shall I? Well, once upon a time, there was a lovely princess, and she lived in a kingdom ruled by evil men. She lived with her mama and her wicked stepfather. You shouldn't do it. I don't know why you let him do this to you. Norma, not now. But you gotta see what he is, Ma. He's just taking advantage of you. I know what he is. I could do worse. - Listen... - Honey, I haven't got time to listen. Damn it. I'm out of lipstick. Mama, who gives a damn about your stupid lipstick, okay? Stank ain't got a right making you do all that. Who says he makes me do anything? What, you like it? That's the art, making them think you like it. Mama, you're not a good enough actress to make anybody think you like stupid, fat Sheriff Keys. - He don't have to make you do that. - Well, it's all I know how to do, honey. Look, would you just run over to China Girl and get me some more lipstick? Come here, honey. Come here. Come to your mama. Come sit down on your mommy. I wish I knew who your daddy was. Your eyes are so beautiful. - Shut up, Ma. - You are. You're so beautiful. And you're so smart, and I love you. But I gotta do what I gotta do, so that you don't have to. So you have a choice out there. - Not everybody's so lucky, honey. - Norma, get your ass out here! Sorry, Mama, I gotta go. Marv's paying me to help him with the load. Okay. Norma! I'm coming! Don't get your panties in a wad! You looking fine today, Norma. Roach! Quit jerking off! Get your lazy ass down here and help with this trailer! Fuck you, Marv. I got my good shirt on. Man. You're breaking my goddamn lock! What're you doing, brother? - You worthless piece of shit. - Get that fucking thing out of my face. You gonna get up in there and help us unload this, or you gonna stand around and wait for your helmet to get polished? Hey, man, let's get something straight, all right? We got a deal. See, I drive the truck, and you rob me. You wanna gnaw on a man's pecker in the process? That shit's up to you. Mack! Hey, you come now! You come in for number-one massage! Oh, I'm coming! You know that, rice cake. Hey, little girl. I don't pay you to stand around and watch your tits grow. Now get your ass up there. Get some smokes over to China Girl. Get the salad dressing to Stank for the product meat. Let's go. I'm on the clock here, fucking people. I do not have time! God damn it! - Yes, sir, shithead. - Hey, Marv, I forgot. Don't even contemplate fucking me out of my percentage, you got that? That's my jellyroll, big daddy. China. Number-two massage. Hey, hey, hey! Easy on that product. Shit! Oh, shit! Fuck! You just look at one of these things cross-eyed, they take you off at the knee. What the hell is that? Somebody's been getting in my pot fields. Nobody touches my shit. Nobody. Boom! "Boom!" Get that shit to Stank. God damn it. - Mama said to tell you she's ready. - Sheriff Keys here yet? Yeah. Y'all take these on over to Larlene's. She done paid for them. Hell, no! - Take them now, you hear? - No! She's nasty. She smells like a wet dog. I ain't asking you to! I'm telling you to! There is a difference. Well, we was in a shit heap, no doubt about that. But me being a brave, young, death-defying princess and all, well, Marv and Stank, they didn't put fear in me. There wasn't much that could. But then there was Larlene. I smell meat. Hello? Give me my meat. Come here. I want to smell you. Get back in here, you juicy little bitch! I can catch you if I want to! Stupid bitch. Shit, man. Marv's on the move. Stank's going to heaven. Thank you for the lipstick, Miss China. - Hey, that's my truck! - No, no, no. Lay down. Relax. God damn it. Someone's stealing my truck! It means some fucking redneck's going to die. Get the fuck... Do what job? What am I gonna do? Stick it up my ass? What's the matter with you? I ain't sticking that up my ass! I didn't ask you to stick it up your ass. I won't let you stick it up my ass. I ain't paying for lip now, God damn it! I'm paying for pussy, by God. Well, if you're paying for pussy, then pussy's what you'll get. I'll even give you some ass! But Stank knows I don't do that kind of shit! What the fuck's going on? What, did somebody come through the trailer park here and brought morality in? Put the camera down, Stank! You gonna let her get by with this shit? No, Sheriff, she's feisty. - Put the camera down! But she knows what puts her food on the table. What? Your fucking pork rinds? Your possum rinds? - Yeah, I've been living off that! - Come on, God damn it! - Just let him do it and get it over with! - Do what? It'll just leave a few bruises. You can cover them up with all that fucking makeup you wear anyway. Let's get this job done. - Fuck you! - Hey, watch the camera! - Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! - Hold the camera. I got her. - Get your ass back here. - There we go. Speed! Quit fucking around and stay still! Hold you back. Get in. The close shot. All right. - Fuck off! Fuck you! Mom? Oh, shit. God. - Did I scare ya? - Oh, shit! That's a cool-ass story, lady. - So, what happened after that? She got the hell out of there, right? Actually, no. I had to finish the video with Sheriff Keys myself. Oh, that is so fucked. Completely fucked. - Yes! Hey! Well, I guess it's like the old saying goes, you know. Being beautiful, it's a blessing and a curse. Wait. You hear that? Rain's stopped. I want to get out of here. I'll figure it out in the daylight. Okay. Now, I've kept you guys way too long. So y'all are staying here tonight. I won't hear any argument. I got plenty of space to hold you till morning. - Hey! - Oh, jeez. What the fuck is this place? Well... - The House of Fun? you probably don't realize it, but y'all are standing in a little bit of history right here. Long ago, truckers far and wide used to stop here for a little R&R in the middle of their long haul through the good old southern U.S. of A. So this used to be some kind of whorehouse? - Asian massage. - Dibs. - I could sleep here, if that's okay. - That's disgusting. Gross. Don't you worry yourself, sweetheart. I got something more upscale in mind for y'all. Come on, girls. Let's go. It's okay. Well, come on in. Don't be getting shy on me now. I think there's a light in here somewhere. Oh, right. I know, it's a bit musty in here, but just pretend like it ain't. And there's just the one bedroom, but y'all will figure it out, I'm sure. - Mr. Lewis? This is worse. - It'll be fine. It's just for the night. Let's just be grateful that God has provided. Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, no problem. This was the home of a genuine war hero, ladies. He served his country, and he did it proud. Well, it looks like he got nothing in return. - Hey. - Thank you. Thank you. We'll survive. Good night. - Good night. Lock the door. Lock it. Check it out. It's a soft floor. I wouldn't do that if I were you. - It's gonna hold. - Would you do this? Would you do this? Ew! I got the bedroom, losers. There's no way I can sleep here. Tiffany, it's just one night. Right. Ma'am, I can't thank you enough. My back door's always open. Nighty night. "It is with passion that we praise..." You can't do this, Gordon. You can't... Christ. Jesus! - Dude, you freaked us out! - So? So don't be sneaking around like that, asshole. I was gonna knock, but the window was closer. And it was scarier, huh? Where's Amber? She is here, right? No, fuck-nut. She upgraded to the honeymoon suite. It's time for you two to leave. What? - Now. - We're not going anywhere, Amber. - Oh, okay. Then you can just watch us. I'm sure you'd get into that freaky shit. Yeah. Yeah! You like that? Yeah? You wanna watch, you fucking bitch? Yeah, you know she's into that freaky Goth shit. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's official. This night cannot get any shittier. Sorry. - Watch it! Damn. - Just calm down, okay? - Oh, man. This place is really freaking me out. Wait! You gotta be kidding me. Pink flamingoes? It's a trailer park. Hello? Hello? Oh, man. Come on. No, don't. I don't wanna see what's in here. Just try not to think about it and go to sleep. God forgive me. We shouldn't be doing it. This is wrong. We gotta stop. No, we can't. This is sin. Well, hell, ain't that half the fun of it, Reverend? This is wrong. We gotta stop. Go. What are you? - What are you? - Oh. I see. I'm not the same girl that you first met. I'm not the girl you fell in love with? I've changed. Is that it? Bring it back. - I can't. Bring it back! - I can't. To hell with you, Reverend! Bring it back. Come on, bring it back! Yeah? Well, how's about a little head? Well, damn. Don't you know it ain't good to leave your woman drying out in the sack? Hey, Mike, you hear that? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Whoa! The Norma lady said we could stay. I didn't know anybody else was here. Number-one massage. Come. I don't know. So good for you. - Yes? - No. No, no, no. Very good for you. - Okay. Whoa! Good boy! Somebody's got smoke. Yes. Such a good boy. Such a big, big boy. Hello? Is this your stuff? Fuck. Stop. - Why would I wanna do that? God! Will you just fucking stop for a second? Stop playing. What? I have to go. Go! What do you mean you gotta go? - Go where? - You know. Go. Well, hurry your ass back. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's about goddamn time. Oh, fuck. Oh, yeah, Amber. Oh, fuck! You are such a dirty girl, babe. Alex? What the fuck? Amber. You are so fucking dead, bitch! - You got that backwards, darling. - Amber! Howdy. I'm Marv. Come here, boy! Marv! Get over here and tell me if this bitch is prettier than me. Shit, darling. She ain't nothing. She looks a little used up, if you ask me. Ain't much for my taste. - Oh, God, God! Please help me. - God? God took his ass out of here a long time ago, sweetheart. If you want help, you best be asking Norma. It's okay, baby. Hey, Marv, bring these assholes over to my trailer. I just got me some inspiration. What now? Some fun. - Shit, Norma. We ain't got the goddamn time. We gotta get a job done. Shit! Now, God damn it, let's get the job done and just have some fun, me and you. God bless you, you're jealous. It don't look good on you. Well, nothing look good on you anymore. You would. - "You would." Let's go, shit-stains! Come on! You want a happy ending? Come on. No happy ending? No happy ending! Massage? Oh, shit! You took my shit. Nobody touches my shit. Oh, fuck! I'm tripping. - You wanna go on a trip, baby? - Yeah. Oh, man, this is some scary shit. No. This is the scary shit. Give me a hand, baby! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Where'd I go? You can't see me. Bridget. Bridget. Bridget! I see you, baby! The King is coming! Somebody help me! Oh, yeah! They're gonna write songs about what I do to you, bitch! Fuck! Fuck! Hey! Hey! You better watch your step over there, little girl! You never know what kind of surprises I may have left in there! Hey, hey, could be anything! Somebody help me! Oh, Jesus! Tiffany. Maybe I laid a mine right there. Maybe I didn't. You know what? I can't remember what the fuck I did do! Boom! Oh, God! Hey, hey! It don't matter, no way! You're still fucked, honey bunny! You better hope they don't put me back together again, bitch! 'Cause if they do... Shit, yeah! Marv! Stank! My penis! My meat! Where's my meat? Where's my meat? I smell meat. What kind of sorry shit are they sending me? You're half-eaten already. Please, God, I don't wanna die! Please. I don't wanna die. Sausage biscuit, I'm sorry. I think maybe you best just go and get some help. Missing your chicken wing like you are there. Honey, I was just kidding! - You think I'm gonna let a prime... - No. ...piece of rump roast like you out of my Crock-Pot? No! - Sit down. - Fuck! We won't tell anybody. Of course you won't tell nobody. Shut the fuck up. Aw... - Beautiful. - Christ. All right, I know y'all are young and you're full of lust in your hearts. And I know y'all were back there having what they call sex. Am I right? Well, that's a goddamn fucking shame! Huh? Pastor Lewis trying to teach you shit-ass kids a lesson and you can't give him anything but disrespect. Maybe you just ought to apologize to the reverend. Get your black ass back on that bed. - No. - Fuck. Matthew 14:15. The Bible says having sex before marriage is a sin! Jesus fucking... Drinking is a sin! Drugs is a sin! John 3:16, cuss words is a sin! Acts 12! Jim Beam 40:11. Pussy's a sin. Fucking's a sin! Sin! Sin! Sin! Sin! Sin! Well, Reverend knows best. So go ahead, apologize to the man. - Go on! Say you're sorry! - Okay, okay, okay. - Okay, okay. - That's it. I'm sorry. So, if I let you go, you'll stop your sinning ways? Yes. I'll stop. I'll stop.
