But whether there be prophecies, they shall fail, whether there be tongues, they shall cease, whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then shall I know even as also I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three, but the greatest of these is charity. No call to arms has ever gone unheeded by a graduate of Bunker Hill Academy. In defence of our country and her principles, many of our brothers have nobly and selflessly made the ultimate sacrifice. To honour them, we will close this baccalaureate service as we close all services here, by reading from the book of remembrance. This will be the last reading of the book for this year.

Lefty's Bar and Grill. - Brian, Dungeons and Dragons tonight? - Not tonight, Shawn. Nice of you to ask. Have a good day. Billy, who are you rooming with next summer? Attention! - Carry on. - Thank you, sir. Larry, what troop are you in next year, D or F? - Keep it down! - I'm in F. All right! I got into Company A! Attention! Boy, I'm not gonna miss your socks... - How's the T-shirt, Pigpen? - Turn it out, Pigpen. Outstanding. As you were, gentlemen. Phew! Oh, God, thank you! - Hey, Brian. You seen Shovel? - Not since morning. He got this summer care package from his mother. One-way douche bag hid it. The thing's the size of a Volkswagen. Home-made fudge, carrot cake, date nut bread. I'm hot on the trail of that sucker. When I see him, I'll... Hey, Shovel! Come here with that food! Sorry, Hulk. Want me to touch up your shoes, sir? I mean, you won't want to go to the general's with your shoes all grungy. You know what I'm gonna hate next year, Charlie? - Breaking in a new plebe. - Yeah. Yes, sir. Zen is no laughing matter. - Yes, sir. - Carry on. Thank you, sir. Four, five, six. I can never hear that sequence of numbers without feeling a rush in my blood. The siege itself was almost as bad as the assaults, and the assaults were out of this world. They kept coming at us, wave after wave. Totally indifferent to casualties. The Chinese always had plenty of bodies to spare. They seemed to be fascinated with our Springfield 1903. The rifle our snipers used. They called it the weapon of the silent death. I wish I could remember that phrase in Chinese. It was rather beautiful. In battle, sir, how do you keep from being scared? You don't. My God, was I scared! I must have lost about 20 pounds, all of it brown! But fear has a way of providing you with a little bonus. It gives you... the wolf. The wolf? It's a quotation from Theodore Roosevelt. Let me see. "All men who have felt the power of the joy of battle know what it's like when the wolf rises in the heart." He knew and I know that man was meant to be a warrior. We're all sons of our Viking fathers. Try to eat a little something, just to keep up appearances. Otherwise I'll get an earache from Mrs Malloy. It's delicious, sir. I don't imagine I had much appetite when I was appointed cadet major. My God. Can't be 45 years ago. Nobody's that old. Wasn't General Black commander then, sir? - General Black? - Yes. Yes, General Black. We cadets used to say that his name described his heart. But we respected the hell out of him. He went the whole nine yards. It didn't matter whether it was war or growing roses or making men. You know that picture of him in the admin building? When I was a plebe it used to scare me walking under it. That's why they hung it there. The truth is you would have loved him like a father. I know I did. Speaking of fathers, Mr Moreland, is your dad still at Fort Benning? No, sir, he's at Fort Polk now. Well, a good top sergeant is worth his weight in gold. I know many a colonel who's had his ass saved by a clever sergeant. Excuse me, Mrs Malloy. I'm sure he's very proud of you, son. - I hope he is, sir. - Oh, thank you. My doctor allows me one of these a day. This is my third. I wish I could tell you that there are more old generals than old doctors, but it's not true. Mrs Malloy, my officers and I will have coffee and brandy in the study. Gentlemen? I'm afraid I can't vouch for the vintage, but ultimately it is the company that counts, isn't it? So, what shall we drink to? I tell you what. Let's drink to the one thing that never changes. To the one permanent part of a man's life. - What's that, sir? - Honour. Honour, indeed. Burglarproof, foolproof, weatherproof. Everything else is subject to the powers that be, dependent upon the caprices of often inferior men. But your honour is your own, inviolate. So, then. To honour. - To honour. - To honour. Well, drink up. We have things to do. Bunker Hill is rich in ceremony, but this is an occasion I always like to keep rather private, when I say goodbye to one major and appoint another in his place. The cadet major is outranked militarily only by me, so that makes it a position of some responsibility. - You'll attest to that, won't you, Cooper? - I'm afraid I can. Captain Moreland, like your predecessor you've distinguished yourself for a number of years here as an underclassman. And in recognition of your scholarship and leadership, your exemplary character, I take pleasure in conferring upon you the rank of cadet major with all the responsibilities and privileges of that rank. Now, they'll respect the rank. But God knows they won't respect the man unless he earns it. And the loyalty of men is always hard-earned. - I'll do my best, sir. - I have every confidence in you. - Thank you, sir. - Congratulations, Brian. - Don't make me look too bad in comparison. - Don't worry. John, if you do half as well at West Point as you have here, you'll make a splendid officer. Thank you, sir. The credit would go to you. If you wouldn't mind accompanying me to the administration building, I have my annual battle of the paperclips with the board of trustees. Entirely adequate. Don't ask me what we had for dinner. Can't remember. - We had this stuff in some green liquid. - We had brandy. Brandy with the general. - Incredible. - Do you even like brandy? That's beside the point. Can't stand it. They're beautiful, roomie. You earned them. Yeah. You deserve them as much as I do. No way, Jos. I'm half-civilian, you know, on my mother's side. Even if I did get you through math, science, - Military science... - True. Very true. Did you get 'em? Whatever happened to good manners? The simple custom of knocking... The gold. I'd give my right nut for those oak leaves. Does a major live at this address? Can I touch 'em? Please? - Man, I can't believe it! - Don't cream on 'em. They'll tarnish. You should have been there. We talked about battles he'd been in. - No shit! - Drank brandy. - No shit! - Toasted honour. You can tell your grandchildren about it. Listen. We are gonna have such a great year. The best year yet. We are gonna command the best regiment this school has ever seen. Damn well said! In honour of this auspicious occasion, Major Moreland, your presence is requested in the hallway. Dismissed! Major Moreland, he's our man. Major Moreland, he's our man. He's the baddest in the land. - He's the baddest in the land. - Thank you, Dave. Thank you. Thanks. That was a nice thing to do, Shawn. I mean it. Thanks. The corps of cadets is commanded by Major John Cooper. The incoming corps commander is Major Brian Moreland. B Company is led by Cadet Captain David Shawn. Eyes right! Eyes right! A Company is led by Cadet Captain JC Pierce. Company, turn! C Company is led by Cadet Captain Robert Harris. Eyes right! - D Troop is led by Cadet Captain Alex Dwyer. - Eyes right! Present arms! Staff, present arms. Stand at ease! Staff, stand at ease. Ladies and gentlemen, for 141 years, old soldiers like myself have stood here on this day and told the finest of America's young men the meaning of the word "commencement". It is a beginning, we told them. But today, this day, it has another meaning, an end. An end to nearly a century and a half of tradition and an end to the heart of us. I have been informed that Bunker Hill Academy is to be closed, all of its buildings torn down, nothing to be left... but memories. It is the decision of the board of trustees in their wisdom that this institution be sold and the land developed for its real estate potential. In order to allow the incoming seniors to graduate and the underclassmen to seek enrolment elsewhere, the board has graciously extended the date of termination for one year. One year. I stand here today with you and look out over these young men and of course I am reminded of other commencement days and other young men, men of courage and conviction, men who have given everything. In Mexico. In the great catastrophe of the Civil War. In Flanders and the Argonne. In the jungles of the Philippines and on Omaha Beach. In the snows of Bastogne, in the Mekong Delta and at the siege of Khe Sanh. How, then, can others say this land is for sale? It has been purchased and paid for with the blood of our graduates. I am a veteran of many terrible battles. But no battle is more important than this one, and this final battle I intend to win. We have a year. Entire wars have been won in less time. Men of the corps, so long as breath and spirit remain, we must fight to preserve this academy so that the traditions that were born here may endure here. We must pledge ourselves to that mission. Yes, come in. Major Moreland requesting permission to speak. Go ahead, Major. Sir, those of us staying summer session were wondering... We wondered if... Stand at ease, Major. Sir, how can they do this? With the stroke of a pen, sir. Their field of honour was a desk top. They didn't consult me. Never hinted at what their plans were. They just papered it and pencilled it and went ahead and did it because that's what the numbers said. Sir, all they want is money. Let them raise the tuition. We'll pay it. I'm afraid it's not quite that simple, son. There's a feeling on the outside that schools like this are anachronistic and leaders of men like you and me are dinosaurs. Sir? Well, you go to the movies, you read books. A military leader is always portrayed as slightly insane. Very often more than slightly. That's because it is insane to cling to honour in a world where honour is held in contempt. Sir, I don't know if I really deserve the rank of major. My first thought was for myself. I didn't think about the others or the school... - Sit down, Mr Moreland. - Sir. Never be ashamed of being human. Without humanity, a leader becomes a tyrant. I was relieved. I figured I had another year. I could graduate and go on to West Point. So you will. And the others too. I haven't spent a lifetime fighting just to turn over and play dead now. I came to Bunker Hill when I was 12 years old. Just like you. With the exception of those 12 years, I've been in uniform all my life. I know men younger than myself who take their pensions and put on stupid little white shirts with cut-off sleeves, alligator on the tit, and spend the rest of their days beating the hell out of a little white ball with an iron club. My God! The thought of it makes me want to puke. They like it like that, civilians. Well, the one thing civilians know is their rights. And they're within their rights to push us out to make way for their goddamned condominiums. But we have one little advantage on them. - What's that, sir? - We're here. And the condos aren't. We have a foothold. You boys are my purpose. You're my family. And I'm not going to let them take you away from me. We won't either, sir. We won't let them. - I knew something like this would happen. - Sure. I figured after one whole year of being shit on, I'd get hit by a bus or something and never get a chance to shit on the next bunch. So you didn't get hit by a bus. So what? Thank you, sir. They'll find me another school for next year. It'll be another year of getting shit on. Will your folks let you come back here for one year? Maybe. I don't know. - Snow White and the two dwarves. - I'm not in any mood for your shit, Dwyer. - Just trying to be friendly. - Yeah. So... what's Moreland say about all this? He says it'll never happen. Bache'll come in and save the day. - I think he's right. - That makes two of you. So what do you think, Dwyer? I think your mother never gave you any toys when you were a baby. Neither did Dwyer's, so he had to play with his sister's. Let's go! Can I use your comb? Jesus! I feel like a big fat hairy hand reached inside of me and yanked something out. Don't sweat it, West. It ain't over. - Great. We still get our year. - Forget about that one year business. This place will be here after the pencil pushers are in the boneyard. Don't forget that we're here and the condos aren't. We've got a foothold. Jesus Christ, it's the Bug again. Every boy needs a hero. With the Bug, it's Jim Morrison. Sir, may I present Miss Lori Cable? Lori, this is General Bache, our commander. - How do you do? - I'm very pleased to meet you, sir. And I you. Dean Ferris, this is Miss Lori Cable. A guest of Major Cooper tonight. - Well done, John. - Thank you, sir. Hello. I know that lovely face but I've forgotten your name. - Cindy Morris. - Cindy, yes. Dean Ferris, Cindy Morris. Well done. It was touch and go there for a while, wasn't it? I'm proud of you. All right, all right! All right, all right! How would you like to see a real stud? My man Mikey's in love! Have fun, JC. Let me show you how a stud works. Come on, come on! - You want us to call the cops? - Call 'em, asshole! You gonna ask me out now or what? What are you looking at, huh? Hey, come here. What do you guys do with each other? - Keep the area clear. Stay away from the gate. - Yes, sir! Keep this area clear! Stay away from the gate! - Sieg heil! - We'll keep this area clear, sir! - Why don't you make us leave, fag? - Yeah! Chicken! What did I tell you, huh? - Don't do that. - Hit him! Knock it off! Break it up! Break it up! Call an ambulance! Move it! It was an accident, sir. There was a round in the chamber. I forgot. You killed him. I'm sorry. Attention! General, don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right. Look, pipe down. - Come on, Bug. Get the shit out of it! - If you can do better, go ahead. - Come on, keep it down! - What is the problem here? Sure looks like one to me. Chest pain, shortness of breath. Over. Take the general to Valley Community. Call once he's checked over. Roger. Out. Hello? Where are you? Oh. So when will you get here? I'm all right. I wasn't part of anything. No, that's OK. I can stay here. There'll be guys here. I said it's OK. I don't know what you expect me to say. I'm sorry I raised my voice. It's just that I thought you'd be here. I'd rather stay here. Really. I love you too. Bye. - You let me know what happens, OK? - All right. - You take care. - OK. - Good summer. - You too. Hand grenades, fragmentation M-26, Machine guns, M-2, one per crate, 36 crates. four per case, we have 20 cases. - Got it. - M-16s, ten full racks. All right, that's 20 to a rack. four racks, 24 to a rack. Six crates of M-16 bayonets. Six 81mm mortars. Bache has enough armament here to start World War III. - So glad they're going. - I didn't want them here in the first place. That was the general's notion of national defence, stock... - How did you get in here? - The door was open. Wonderful. - What do you say we lock it? - What's going on? We're taking inventory. We're no longer to be trusted with weapons. What are we gonna drill with? - After last night? - That was an accident. That's not for you to decide and I don't care to discuss it. Look, I came to ask about the general. - He's in intensive care. - How is he? They say the next 24 hours will be the critical stage. He's a strong man. He'll be all right. - You can ask for yourself. - I called. They wouldn't let me talk to him. - You know as much as I do. - Well, who... Who's gonna be in charge of the summer session? I'm not sure there'll be a summer session. What? Goodbye, Mr Moreland. They're worthwhile only if there is a reasonable chance for success. - How much time has elapsed since... - 18 hours and 12 minutes. Dr McCoy must have told you... - Why doesn't he use his phaser? - He can't. How come? The brain's protected by a phaser-proof electromagnetic shield. - You seen this one before? - I've seen all of them before. - Turn on the news! - You're not supposed to be here! We're watching this! Shut up! ... shattered overnight by the still-unexplained shooting of a local boy. Donald Andrews, 17, of Foxhaven, died late last night as a result of a gunshot wound... - God, the kid bought it, huh? - ... between local boys and cadets. The shot was allegedly fiired by General Harlan Bache, superintendent of the Bunker Hill Military Academy. In response, police have ordered all weapons on academy grounds to be confiiscated. What are we supposed to train with? ... an armoury on the school grounds, which cadets have used for training purposes. Meanwhile, General Bache lies in very critical condition at Valley Community Hospital, suffering from a heart attack which occurred immediately following the tragic events. The school, which had planned to cease operations next June, has been ordered closed immediately by its proprietors. - What? - Son of a bitch! Anderson's father's a big lawyer. Maybe he can write something. Shovel, stop your goddamn feeding your face! I'd like to grab a grenade and ram it right up their asses! That's not fair. - Stop feeding! - They don't even give a shit! Leave me alone! Hey! Here's today's closing fiigure. The lady said the proprietors ordered the school closed. Now, as I see it, we are the proprietors. - What does that mean to us? - Get the door. All right, now listen up. Mr Stewart? Captain Dwyer, sir, Bunker Hill Academy. - What can I do for you? - Provision list, sir. - I heard they were closing. - Mopping-up battalion has to eat. Took 150 years to build it. Gonna take time to put it to bed. Usually they want me to deliver the stuff myself. SOP undergoing change because of all the unpleasantness. - SOP? - Standard operating procedure. Call the academy for verification. - Oh, no. That's OK. - Thank you, sir. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Move it! Forward post to Lee One. They're coming through the gate. Over. Command post to Lee One. Vehicle on the way. Over. Wait a minute. What is this? They were all right here just hours ago. I... I don't understand. See those racks? They were filled. What's going on here, Dean? - Moreland? - Who is this boy? He's the ranking cadet. Moreland. Do you have any explanation for this? My God. Where are all the weapons? - The weapons are secured, sir. - What do you mean secured? - You mean you stole them? - No, sir. We confiscated them. - Dean, where's the phone? - There's one in the office. - Afraid not, sir. We've cut the lines. - Oh, my God. If you don't turn those weapons over immediately, you're going to jail. The right to bear arms is guaranteed in the Constitution. Tell us where the weapons are or this'll be the sorriest day of your life. We have three demands. When they're met, we'll return every weapon. - Who else...? - Number one. I want a meeting with Bache... - Hands behind your back! - Stay where you are. Number two. I want a commission to look into the selling of this academy to real estate interests. Number three. I want a meeting between my officers, myself, and the board of trustees to discuss alternatives to the closing of this academy. That's it. That's all we want. - What's the problem? - Green light, Pierce. Come on. Let's go. - Oh, shit. - Want me to check under the hood? - For what? - I'll know when I get there, won't I? - Hey, what's it look like? - Try it now. Why's Dwyer checking the hood? Are you seeing what I'm seeing? JC? JC! Wake up, Pierce. Are you reading me? Dwyer, this is starting to be a real emergency. JC, are you catching that action? - You guys having some problems? - Yeah, I see 'em. - I'm talking to you! - Dwyer, for Christ's sake hurry up! Let's go. You guys having a problem? - Dwyer! - Yeah, yeah. - Dammit, Pierce, come on! - Dwyer, get back in the truck. Shit. - You cretins lose something? - Just a mechanical... You're the bastard who killed Don. Move over here, quick! Move, move, move, move! Come on! Move out! Come on! Let's go! Watch those rifles and stay to the right! Keep it moving! Keep it moving! Come on! Keep it moving! - Heads up! Look alive! - Put that ammunition down right there. Let's go! - Move it! - Move it! Hustle up! Soldier, bring that around over there! Come on, soldier! Hurry! - You hear from them yet in town? - They're coming home. Here they come! We got it! What the hell were you doing back there? Pulling your lame ass outta the grinder, shithead. - I could kick your ass from here to Albany. - You try! - What's going on? - He rammed a sheriffs car. - What's the problem? - This asshole just shot up the town. - I didn't buy into this to blow people away. - We're here! - We're not sitting in jail, we're here! - Did you get the food? - Half of it. - Half is better than nothing. The guy's a maniac. He rammed a sheriff. Damn right. Saw my duty and I did it! Everybody, quiet down! - Hulk! Escort the bus beyond the gate. - You're gonna let them go? We're supposed to be soldiers. We're not taking hostages. I want the officers in the administration building. Let's move out and move the food! Attention! I don't ever want to see what I just saw. We didn't train to go spastic at the first sign of trouble. Goddamn! I'm glad the general didn't see that. These cadets will follow you only if they respect you. All right. Sit down. At ease. - How did we lose the truck? - It stalled. We were in a hard place. Shawn grabbed the chance to use his weapon. We were in an explosive situation which jeopardised the mission. I defused it. - Beautiful. You really have a way with words. - He did get us out of it, Alex. You'd still be getting thrown around by those townies if he hadn't cut loose a few rounds. I don't like the idea of gunplay, but the mission was successful. That's my whole point! I don't call what happened a successful mission. - Naturally. - We have to show we're serious. - And we don't want to hurt anyone. - What are we asking? That the school be kept open. That's all. Other kids are vandalising their school. We want ours to stay open. If we behave like soldiers and not kids in a riot, we can win this. - It's gotta be done by the book. - That's all I ask. It'll be done by the book. We stick together, we go the whole nine yards. - Agreed? - Agreed. Sound the general alarm. Boys, this is Lieutenant Hanson of the state police. Before things get out of hand, put down your weapons and open the gates. You hear me? We have conditions first. Let's have an answer on those. You have illegally seized private property. Under the state penal code you have committed grand larceny. You have threatened the life of a federal officer. Nobody's life was threatened. You fired upon citizens and a deputy sheriff. You boys are in very serious trouble. - Put down your weapons or we'll use force. - What about the demands? You have one minute to comply. Get down! - 35 seconds. - Can we speak to General Bache? - Prepare to assault! - Prepare to repel! - Don't shoot me! - Hold your fire! - Hold your fire! - Hold your fire! Don't shoot me! Pull it back! Would you describe the situation at Bunker Hill as stalemate? I would not call it a stalemate. We're trying to ascertain how many cadets are rebellious and how many are hostages. - We hadn't heard there were hostages. - We have reason to believe there are. Are the police prepared to use force to end the situation? We will protect the lives and the property of the people of the state. If it means resorting... Even if that means... They won't interview us. The police won't let 'em. Why do I get the feeling that that guy would get pleasure blowing our brains out? - Do you see any way out of this? - Depends on Bache. I'm wondering about that heart attack. What if General Bache never even had a heart attack? - What if they're just keeping him from us? - Why would they do that? I don't know. To rattle us, make more of the whole thing than we ever wanted. We never wanted any goddamn war. - Order! - Order! Arms! Company commanders, take your posts. Prepare for inspection. Major! Hey! Hey! Something's going on! The head cop's on the box and he wants to talk to you. All right! We got it! Shawn, take over! Battalion dismissed! Yaw! This is Major Moreland. Over. - This is Sergeant Briggs. - Yes, sir. I have a delegation here that wants to meet with you. Tell the board we'll be honoured to meet with them. It's a delegation of parents. - Parents? - Six of them. The man in charge is Master Sergeant Kevin Moreland. Will you talk to them? Yes, sir. Send them in at 0930 hours. Affiirmative. So it's your father. So what? Damn near everybody here has got a mother or father hanging around outside. - You don't. - Yeah, well, I'm a hard case. - Sorry. - Forget it. Look, at least your old man has got a nodding acquaintance with the real world. Hell, I like him. Everybody likes my old man. You do too, Brian. Admit it. That's why you're so scared. No, I ain't scared. I don't know if I like him. I'm still thinking about it. Yeah, well, don't rush into anything. When my mother died I was sitting in the hallway in the army hospital. I was worried as hell. I knew she was real sick. She had this bad kidney thing. So I'm sitting there and my father comes out of the room and tells me that she's dead. He led me to this little chapel they had there and he sat me down and he told me I could cry for 15 minutes. He gave me 15 minutes to cry and after that I wasn't supposed to cry again. So he left me alone in the chapel and came back... he came back 15 minutes later. - Jesus. What did you do? - Well, I did what I was told. I cried for 15 minutes. She was a beautiful woman... my mother. She was crazy about the old man. I don't know, I guess he loved her too. You never told me that story. Yeah, I was 12. That's when I came here. Brian. Hey, Brian, they're down at the gate. Better get going. All right. When this is over, you and me are gonna go round and round. Yeah. But first you're gonna move your goddamn arm. - Hello, Brian. - Hello, sir. You look like you might have grown an inch or two. - You've put on a couple of pounds too. - A couple. - Sorry you had to come all the way up here. - Nah. - How you doing, Alex? - Hello, Sergeant Moreland. - The old place looks different... - Get to the bottom line. Hold your water. Bottom line. The truth is these folks are worried about their kids. They think some of them are being held against their will. Everyone's here because they want to be here. Our son would not be involved in something like this. Lady, if my son can be involved in it, your son can be. Let's not get holier-than-thou. - Let us hear it from our children. - Yes. I can't call my soldiers away from their posts to calm down their parents. - You're only children! - They'll try to add kidnapping to the rest of it. - We want to see our kid. - I'll try. - Good. - Under my terms. I hope you're proud, Sergeant Moreland. You have fathered a son of a bitch. You people shut up! I can't think through all your static. We aren't in the army, Sergeant. No apologies necessary. Just keep the hell quiet and let me take care of this. Frigging feather merchants. I don't blame them, sir. It's a little hard to understand. - Ever get in the habit? - Oh. No, sir. No, thanks. Smart. Damn things will kill you. - What am I gonna tell those people? - I never thought this would involve you. Let me tell 'em it was growing pains. The wrong execution of the right idea. - The wrong execution of the right idea? - Yeah. They'll understand that. Look, Brian, all the men in our family have been soldiers. - I know. - Plain dogfaces with a knack for surviving. - I hoped somebody would break into brass. - I have my command. You're not thinking straight. You have a bad way to lose a pretty bright future, kid. Stop calling me kid. You expect me to call you Major? You can forget it. Look at this operation. You got your strength nose to nose with the cops. Eventually even they'll figure out you've got a vulnerable rear flank and they'll sneak in. There, by the field, behind the trees, and they'll throw a net over your asses. You can say that... The first canister of tear gas, half your troops'll wet their pants and run. And how bright was it to let this delegation in here? Look at me. I could break your neck and you wouldn't be able to do a thing about it. You'd be shot. My next in command would take over. I read that book too. We could take you all as hostages, but we won't. We have a code of honour. Sweet Jesus! Is that what this is all about? Somebody's lofty shit about honour? Yours? Yes, mine, and I learned it here. General Bache lives it... - He's here because there's no place... - He is the example we follow! Bache has been passed over so many times, he's got a stiff neck from the draught. Bache! Bache is living proof that horses' asses outnumber horses! Captain Shawn, escort my... the sergeant off the base! - Muster the men in the quad. - Yes, sir. - We've pulled together well, haven't we? - Yes, sir! General Bache would be proud of us. If he were here, I know he'd tell us to hold out. To finish what we've started and not to be halfway about anything. They're saying some of you are being held against your will, you don't want to be here. Either they're right or we're right. Nobody's gonna cut you down if you don't believe in what we're doing, or if you're afraid of parents or the cops. Anybody who isn't 100 per cent sure of why we're here and what we're doing, take one step forward. - Battalion! - Company! Attention! - Left! - Left! Face! - Forward! - Forward! March! - Major Moreland, he's our man. - Major Moreland, he's our man. - Bunker Hill we make our stand. - Bunker Hill we make our stand. - Sound off. - One, two. - Sound off. - Three, four. - One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four. Sir? You got any grenades? Thank you, sir. - You got any grenades? - Sure. - Can I have one? - Here you go. - Thanks. - Oh, and, Shovel? - Don't eat it. - Cute. - Carry on. - Thank you, sir. - Any news from the outside? - Attention. - Carry on. - No news, sir. His batteries are down. We can't even pick up the shitkickers. We can see them from here. They've got their thumbs up their asses. - They don't scare us, do they, Charlie? - No, sir. Me either, sir. They don't scare me. - Good night, guys. - Good night, sir. Charlie. That's what I call grace under pressure. Why not? Nero fiddled while Rome burned. - That wasn't grace, that was crazy. - Depends on your point of view. That's Peru. - Meaning? - Meaning maybe this is just as crazy. Alex, you've been picking at this from the beginning. What's wrong with you? Things are going beautifully. We're in better shape now. Now we're a corps. General Bache used to talk about men under pressure. - How they act as one. We're seeing it. - Thus spake Saint Bache. - OK. - He's only a man, Brian. Like your father, my father. Just a man. Not every word out of his mouth is some holy nugget. Right. Whatever you say. Don't let that display of loyalty go to your head. It won't mean beans to anybody out there. They'll say it was brainwashing. Maybe they're right. I half expected you to be the one to break ranks. Head for the comforts of home. - The thought crossed my mind. - What stopped you? My sense of honour may be a little ragged, but I don't walk out on a friend. If you want to argue about this, we'll argue in the morning. I've got to get some sleep. All right. It can wait till morning. What do you think they put in those flakjackets? Is it lead or what? No. Lead's too heavy. They wouldn't be able to move. They probably use some super-plastic. I read that it's got something to do with the configuration... Wanna try and spell that, bonehead? He couldn't even spell his own name. - What are you laughing at? - Keep it down. Shit. Down. Berets off. Forward observation to command post. Convoy approaching. Looks like heavy stuff. Have C Squad cover the rooftops. C Squad, rear of the building! A Squad, behind the trees! How's it going, Brian? They had to call in the heavyweights. - Get more power on the rooftops. - I already have. - Reinforce the rear and left flanks. - Yes, sir. - No one fires unless I give the order. - Yes, sir. Too much! There must be Don't sweat it. Stephen Miller? Stephen Miller? It's Mom, honey. Will you listen to me, please? It's still not too late to come out of there and forget it ever happened. We have such a wonderful summer planned for you. Don't go and get involved in something like this. Please. Don't spoil everything, now. Please. Come out and at least talk to us. Five minutes. Just let us know you're all right. Charlie Auden! This is Dad, Charlie. Your mother and I are pretty scared out here. She's crying all the time. I can't stop her. You were never that crazy about this school. You've been complaining all year. We can't fiigure out why you're in there somewhere with a gun. I mean, we just can't believe it. Come on home, Charlie. Look, you can go to any kind of school you want to. Just come out of there. Please come out. Don't hurt yourself. Come on out. Billy. Billy, I hope you can hear me. You've always gone along with the crowd, and I know kids are like that. But this is one thing you've got to do for yourself. Sometimes being accepted by your friends isn't worth the price. - Your real friends... - Who goes there? - Lieutenant West. - Advance and be recognised. Stand easy. - Everything OK? - Yes, sir. What are your orders? Shoot anything that comes over, under or around the wall. - On whose orders? - Captain Shawn's, sir. - Carry on. - Yes, sir. Just a minute. - Would you? - Yes, sir. No problem, sir. - Carry on. - Yes, sir. Any contact? No. Nothing. Maybe they just plan on, you know, just coming in. They would have done that if that's what they came for. I was hoping to get some word on the general, see how he's doing. Bug, go to the mess hall and get us a pot of hot coffee. Yes, sir. Sit down. Do you really expect them to negotiate with us? Yeah. They're not gonna stay out there forever. We'll hear from them. I don't know, Brian. - Things might escalate. - Escalate? How? For one thing, Shawn's Red Berets are really pumped up. There's a sentry out there ready to shoot to kill. That's a sentry's job. What good is he if he's not prepared to shoot? Maybe he's a little more than ready. And it's coming from Shawn, Brian. I think he's running private little pep rallies out there for them or something. - A natural-born leader. - He's got me a little worried, is all. He's too much into this. He's at a pitch, man. He's always been like that, Eddie. After the Hulk, who would you want on your side if you were in a fight? - Well... Shawn. - Right. - First I'd want to talk my way out of the fight. - Who wouldn't? Now, listen. Nobody here wants to get killed. They know we're right and they're not gonna come in here shooting. Trust me, Eddie. - Order! - Order arms! - Parade! - Parade rest! Company commanders, front and centre. - Status? - D Troop, two men missing, sir. - Alpha Company, four men missing, sir. - Charlie Company, five men missing, sir. - Bravo Company, all present, sir. - Very well. - 11 goddamn scumbags! - Hold it down! - The next yellow puke that goes... - Shawn! I want a full report from the roommates of the 11 that are missing. And I want... Major Moreland. Major Moreland. Contact Colonel Kerby. - You're the fellow who started all this. - Major Moreland, sir, the ranking cadet. Yes. I understand you're quite a leader, Major Moreland. Sir, we were all well trained here at Bunker Hill. - That's part of why we won't give it up. - I can understand that. What's another 100 condominiums, more or less? Condominiums are more easily built than leaders. Yeah. Exactly. Only... you and I don't have the last word on that subject. But I do have something to say about it. Mr Moreland, you know and I know that it's never gonna go your way. You do know that, don't you? - You got something to tell me, Colonel? - I'm telling you. Brian, I'm no fancy negotiator with a PhD in psychology. That's not what I do for a living. I'm the governor's muscle. I get called when he gets nervous. Don't try to scare us. The police already tried that. I know, and your parents didn't fare any better. But I've got to let you know what's going on out there. They don't see you guys as rebels with a good cause. They think you're home-grown terrorists and it's got 'em scared shitless. - Nice American boys don't act like this. - We have a home here. Something we think is worth defending. Why is that so tough to understand? Sure, and you have the right to defend it, in all the accepted ways. Hell, I'll help you. But you can't start by stealing government property. I've seen what happens when you go the other way. We'd get up to bat and the game would be over. At least you would all be alive, which is all I give a damn about. Don't worry about us. How many kids do you have here? Come on, for Christ's sake. It's not classified information. I've seen ten create a fearful momentum and you have over 100 here. With weapons. - And some really don't want to be here... - You saw the muster yesterday. - They had a chance to leave, they stayed. - 11 kids did leave. Sounds like 11 boys who weren't much good to us anyway. I don't care what happened here. I don't wanna see scared kids crawling over the wall in the middle of the night. You won't. Escort the colonel back to the gate. Yes, sir. - You don't have a whole lot of time, Brian. - Colonel Kerby, sir. As you were, soldier. Jesus Christ! They're either soggy or stale! It's good training for a young captain, Mr Pierce. Those guys are probably sending out for pizza. Weekend warriors! One big difference between those guys and us. They're used to shooting at people. Are you kidding? On a Monday morning, these guys don't know a muzzle from a rat's ass. - Bet we could find a witness to say different. - Yeah, but they couldn't shoot back. - Captain Shawn. - Yes, sir. - Call the corps to formation. - Everyone? - Yes, everyone. - Yes, sir. Corps all present and accounted for, sir. Stand at ease! Gentlemen, when we started this, we agreed it would be done by the book. A military operation. Someday we'll be respected for what we've done. Last night 11 cadets jumped the wall. And today they're saying, outside, that the rest of you must be hostages. A decision has to be made and it has to stick! We can't tolerate any more desertions. If you don't have the guts for what we've taken on, walk out now in the light of day. If you're as committed as I am, stay. We'll win this battle. We'll win it with honour. Otherwise step forward, lay down your weapons, walk out. Take off that beret. Lieutenant West requesting permission to be dismissed, sir. Brian. - Look, Brian... - Dismissed. Detail, right face! Forward march! I don't know what's going on. I can't believe you love the school so much to sit there and want to die for it. Maybe I underestimated those damn tapes. Kids I can understand, Hulk was always marginal, but West. It was a big mistake, Brian, if you don't mind me saying. Bache would have never played it that way. Yeah. I wish I could talk to him. He'd tell us to hold out. Yeah, I know he would. Why don't you go grab some sleep? Go on. Sleep. Can you sleep? Me? Slept like a baby this afternoon. Two whole hours. Go on, lie down, Brian. You'll feel better. - Wake me if something happens. - Will do. Hey! Hey! What the hell's going on here? - Hey! Where's the water? - Who turned off the goddamn... - How does it look? - It's OK right now. - We should guard the other water heaters. - Let's make thirst a capital offence. He's right. We run out of water, we've had it. If we can't trust our own guys, what's the point? We couldn't trust them to stay with us. How can we trust them to save water? - West cut our strength in half. - Wait a minute, dammit. - He is our friend. - With friends like that... Hey! I don't wanna hear anyone bad-mouth West. He did what he felt was right. - Put guards on the water supplies. - Yes, sir. Brian! MASH! Any news? You want the news? I'll give you the news. We take you now to reporter Alex Dwyer on the scene of the uprising. I'm outside the gates of Bunker Hill Academy talking to a National Guardsman, a young man not much older than the infants who have taken over this old institution. Let's see what the grunt on the street says. Trooper, how do you feel about the possibility of taking this school by force? - Give me those! - I'd like to frag the freaks! Sir, what's your opinion of this crisis? I feel sorry for the little cherubs. It's society's fault. We failed to meet the needs... Thank you, Private Bleeding Heart. We take you now to a press meeting, live in progress, with Colonel Adolf Kerby of the National Guard. - Can you hear me? - You're an ass, Dwyer. It's the governor's fervent hope that force will not be necessary in retaking the school. However, the governor will not stand by indefinitely and allow this to continue. Let's have an interview with Major Moreland. What's going on here? What's going on here? - I'm here inside the walls of Bunker Hill... - On your feet! Let's go! ... with Major Brian Moreland, commander of the rebellious youths. Correction. Defending cadets. Let's go. Come on. - There seems to be some dissension... - No, this is a military operation. A military operation. I see. - No dissension, no desertion and no... - Knock it off! - Those of you not on station should sleep. - You can't escape the press that easily. Knock it off! It's not funny any more! It's getting to be a real pain in the ass! Drop it! Back to you, Walter. The major's getting pissed off. - Come on. Move out. - And we don't want to piss off the major. Piss off the major, you find yourself escorted out between two of Shawn's Red Berets. You just keep going and going, don't know when to stop. Think with your brain, you'll piss off the major. Piss off the major and you find yourself escorted outjust like the major's father. Leave my father out of this. - Reason with the major, out you go. - Let's go. Pretty soon there'll be nobody left but one pissed-off major. Knock it off! We've had enough! You don't wanna save this school for posterity. You wanna wear it like your own cocoon! Just you and Bache, snug as two bugs queer for each other. Stay back. - Come on, Brian! - Get him! Hold it down! Hold it down! - They turned off the power. - Turn 'em on! - Hold it down! - What's that noise? Listen up! Get your weapons and man your battle stations! Check the 50s and 60s. Make sure they're prepared and ready. - Come on! - Move, move, move! - Don't let friendship keep you here any more. - Don't worry. Get down. Give me a wire brush, Charlie. Looks like it hasn't been run since World War I. Yeah, if then. OK, that ought to do it. Hold your breath. All right, hit the switch. Got it. Go on, get somebody. Major Moreland. - You know you're responsible for that boy? - It was an accident. I've gone to the mat with the civil authorities. I'm urging them to take into consideration your youth and the strain... Cut the bullshit. Nobody in here's young any more. Excuse me if I don't shed tears over your lost youth. You've had your chances to toss it in. You've got this chance. The governor is this close to ordering us to take you in by force. When that order comes, I'll do it and you won't ever be that unhappy again. I'll have to do it. They want us to be good little boys now so we can fight some war for them in the future. Some war they'll decide on. We'd rather fight our own war right now. Brian, we're talking about boys so young they haven't got hair one between their legs. That's never been any qualification for a soldier. Good Christ! The final stage of any mobilisation is the children, the seed corn. What in God's name did they teach you in here? What did they turn you into? A soldier. The only thing I ever wanted to be. A soldier? No, goddammit, I'm a soldier, with the career goal of all soldiers. I wanna stay alive in situations where it ain't easy, but you, my friend, you're a death lover. I know the species. has put you in love with death. Somebody sold you on the idea that dying for a cause is romantic. Well, that is the worst kind of all the kinds of bullshit there is! Dying is only one thing. Bad. Don't find that out. Please. We'll reduce our demands to just one. I'm listening. A meeting with General Bache. Let the order come directly from him. We'll obey. General Bache died last night at six o'clock. You son of a bitch. You and I have nothing more to talk about. Company, halt! Left face! Firing detail, ready! Take aim! Fire! Take aim! Fire! Take aim! Fire! General Bache... prized this sword. It was given to him by General MacArthur in appreciation of his service. And he used to say it was forged in the furnace of honour. What I know of honour I learned from him and what I know of dignity I learned from him. He taught us there are things worse than death. Defeat, dishonour. General Bache, we commit your spirit to eternity, to the company of great soldiers... and great souls. Company, left face! Forward march! How come they knocked off the tapes, Charlie? I don't know. Probably just to keep us wondering. It's working. Yeah. Charlie? I'm scared. I mean it. I'm really scared. We're all gonna get killed. I know it. No, we're not, Derek. Try to think of something else. I can't. Please, let's just give up, OK? I mean, we'll leave, OK? Please? - It'll be all right. - No, it won't. - Close your eyes. - I can't. Get low, Derek. Come on. - Derek! Derek, don't run! - I don't wanna die! Derek! Don't run! - Derek! - Hold your fire! Stop! You boys in here, this is the end of it. Right now, right here. You're coming out. Someone finally had to die. Kerby, hold it right there! You will talk to our men through us. I want all of you boys to know that at dawn we will take this campus. My men, our tanks, our helicopters, we will take this campus. I don't want to see any more of you boys die. Men, stand fast and listen up. You are soldiers. You will continue to follow the orders of your superior officers. - You will continue... - Those who don't want this to happen, at dawn throw down your weapons and run to the nearest National Guardsman. We will do our best to protect you and to see that you get out safely. Like they did Charlie! The bastards killed him! Mr Moreland! Dawn. I got a tank up here, Billy. Where's Moreland? - Bug, where's Moreland? - I don't know. Not here. - Have you seen Shawn? - No. They've all disappeared. I don't know where anybody is. ... honour, country. These are the virtues instilled in a cadet at Bunker Hill. They form the backbone of a curriculum which has produced a long and illustrious line of soldiers and statesmen who have served the United States with distinction since before the Civil War. At Bunker Hill our goal is not only to educate the boy, it is to develop the man, to plumb potential, to nurture it in an atmosphere of strict discipline and intensive training. Those boys who are dedicated often fiind acceptance to West Point, Annapolis or the Air Force Academy, where... I was thinking about Charlie. You know, he came in here scared of his own shadow, homesick. Used to cry himself to sleep. I was betting he wouldn't last the first week of orientation. You'd call "Right face" and he'd go in the other direction. And by Thanksgiving he was calling cadence. Never got a hit in inspection. He turned out to be a tough little kid. Always so eager to please. It's getting close to dawn. That plebe year, it's a tough time. Yeah, it is. Some of them, like Charlie, thrive on it. I did. I... I thrived on it. I can't remember why any more. I was thinking about that basketball game we played, one on one, last winter. It was so cold, hurt to breathe, and your fingers could barely feel the ball, you know. There was no net on the hoop. We were always arguing the other's shot didn't go in. Laughing and acting crazy It was so dark you couldn't see the ball against the backboard. I love that feeling. We'll have a rematch, one on one. It's gonna hurt like hell to leave it all behind. No one leaves it all behind, Brian. We're gonna take it with us. Were they just words? Honour, duty, country? I loved that man. Being in his presence made me feel privileged. But there had to be something missing in all that he taught us, or this wouldn't have happened. I... I've done a terrible thing here. You weren't alone. We were all in it together. It was my command and I was in charge. When I knelt next to Charlie, I tried to find some justification. But honour doesn't count for shit when you're looking at a dead little boy. You don't think of the book of remembrance or bugles or flags or 21-gun salutes. All you think about is what a neat little kid he was... and how you're gonna miss him. Declare a victory, Brian. Let's say we won the war. Let's go home. Fall in! Fall in! It's over! Fall in. Fall in! It's over! Fall in! Let's go! Fall in! It's over! Let's go! Fall in! Fall in! - Let's go, Lyle. Fall in. - Bring them up from the parade field. Fall in. It's over. Let's go, Frank. Fall in. - Tell 'em to fall in. - Fall in, guys. Bring it down. Rusty! - Fall in. - Yes, sir! Fall in! Fall in down in the quad. It's over. Fall in! It's over! It's over! Fall in! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Shawn! Calling chopper two. Lay down the smoke! Shawn! Dammit! Move out! Let's go! Stay inside! Keep clear! - Shit! - Shawn! It's beautiful, man! Beautiful! Eyes right! Eyes right! Eyes right! Company, turn! Eyes right! Eyes right! Eyes right!
