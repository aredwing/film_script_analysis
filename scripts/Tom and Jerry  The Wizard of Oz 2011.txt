Auntie Em. Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto. Dorothy, please. We're trying to count. But Aunt Em. She hit him over the... Oh, don't bother us now, honey. This old incubator's gone bad... ...and we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks. Oh, the poor little things. All right, come on now, let's go. There you go. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Thanks, Jer. Auntie Em, Miss Gulch said she was gonna take Toto away. She said she was gonna get the sheriff. - Dorothy, please. - Oh, all right. Oh. Oh. Oh! Dorothy. Oh, get me out of here. - Are you all right, Dorothy? - I'm all right. Tom, Jerry. Thanks ever so much. What's all this jabberwopping when there's work to be done? Thank you, boys. I'm much obliged. Auntie Em, you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto? Now, Dorothy, dear... ...you always get yourself into a fret over nothing. Just help us out today and find yourself a place... ...where you won't get into any trouble. Yes, ma'am. Come on, Toto. Boys, I know you two like to tussle, but will you promise me something? Promise me you'll be friends and work together... ...to keep an eye on Dorothy. Please, boys, you're awfully good at looking after her. She needs someone to protect her, and Toto, too. Promise me you'll do that. Thank you, boys. Now, you stay close to Dorothy. Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto? There must be. It isn't a place you can get to by a boat or a train. It's far, far away. Behind the moon. Beyond the rain. Somewhere over the rainbow Way up high There's a land that I've heard Of once in a lullaby Somewhere over the rainbow Skies are blue And the dreams that you dare To dream really do come true Someday I'll wish upon a star And wake up where the clouds Are far behind me Where troubles melt like lemon drops Away above the chimney tops That's where You'll find me Somewhere over the rainbow Bluebirds fly Birds fly over the rainbow Why then Oh, why can't I? If happy little blue birds fly Beyond the rainbow Why, oh, why Can't I? Mr. Gale. I want to see you and your wife right away about Dorothy. That dog is a menace to the community. I'm taking him to the sheriff to make sure he's destroyed. No, no. I won't let you take him. You go away, you wicked old witch. We can't go against the sheriff, Dorothy. Put him in the basket, Henry. Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let her take Toto. Don't let her take him. What in the world? I know you two. You're that Tom and Jerry from the Gale farm. I'll teach you to get in my way. Take that. And that. Get off. I'll get you, Tom and Jerry. And that little dog, too. Toto, you came back. Oh, I'm so glad. Miss Gulch will be coming back for you. We've got to get away. We've got to run away. It's a twister, it's a twister. Get the horses up. Dorothy. Jiminy Crickets. Thanks again. Come on. Dorothy. Dorothy, where are you? It's too late, we can't look for her now. Auntie Em. Auntie Em. You keep trying the door. Auntie Em. Uncle Henry. Look out, mouse. You won't eat me, cat. Put 'em up, put 'em up. Watch it. There's more where that came from. You mean that thing is with you? Where did you come from? Why then, you must know Dorothy. Well, I'll be. I'm Tuffy, the Munchkin Mouse. And I'd like to welcome you to Munchkin Land. I'm afraid Dorothy's left hours ago. The house you and Dorothy came in... ...landed on the Wicked Witch of The East and crushed her. Dorothy had freed us from the Witch... ...and then Glinda, the Good Witch of the North... ...gave Dorothy the ruby slippers. But then, the Wicked Witch of the West showed up... ...to take the magical ruby slippers. And she'll do anything to get them. So Glinda sent Dorothy... ...to the great and powerful Wizard of Oz in the Emerald City... ...where she's gonna ask the Wizard to send her home to Kansas. So she set off on the yellow brick road. Follow the yellow brick road. Stop. You can't follow Dorothy. It's too dangerous. So you two promised you'd protect Dorothy, huh? Then take me with you. I know I can help. What do you say? Don't laugh. I'm very insecure about my size. Oh, it's sad believe me, mister When you're tiny as a blister Without the strength to fight But I could show my prowess Though I'm just a humble mouse If I only had the height I'm afraid there's no denying I'm small, but I'm not crying I'm gonna be all right. I'd be tall as a giant I'd be big and self-reliant If I only had the height We're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz We hear he is a wiz of a wiz If ever a wiz there was If ever, oh, ever a wiz there was The Wizard of Oz is one because Because, because, because Because Because of the wonderful things He does We're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz If ever a wiz there was If ever, oh, ever a wiz there was The Wizard of Oz is one because Because, because, because Because Because of the wonderful things he does Uh-oh. Now which way do we go? Ho, ho, ho. Look at those. That's a strange threesome right there. Oh, look at them. Yeah, odd. Yeah, go ahead and do something. You say something and I'll say something. Pardon me, but that way is very nice. What are you, nuts? No one goes that way. What do you mean? Lots of people go both ways. How do you do, Mr. Crows? I'm Tuffy and these are my friends, Tom and Jerry. Did you see a young girl skip by with a basket and a dog? Sure did. - She passed by just a few hours ago. - Yeah. She hooked up with the scarecrow and they went dancing off down that road there. Thanks, fellers. We'll catch up to Dorothy in no time now. Unless she went skipping down that road. You know, I think she did. Oh, well. At least we helped. - See you. - Oh, we sure fooled them. It's funny. We had to do it. Hmph! I don't know, fellers, this doesn't look right. What do you think we should do? Follow the yellow brick road? Follow the yellow brick road. Wicked Witch. Hide. There's that cursed girl. When I have her ruby slippers... ...my power will be the greatest in all of Oz. But how to do it? Oh, oh, oh. You could ask her nicely. Hey. You could trade her for a bag of magic beans. Ahh! Sorry. Wrong story. Now, quiet, both of you. I'm trying to think. I said quiet. Ah! That's how I'll get that girl. I'll turn these pretty dandelions into an avalanche. We gotta get that wand. It's the only way to save Dorothy. Hey! What? Whoa! - Got it. - What? Get that wand. Jerry, catch. Give me that wand, little mouse. It's mine. Ha, ha! Enough of this foolishness. Come on, you two, quit clowning around. I'll deal with you right after I finish that girl. Ha-ha-ha! Ha, ha... What? Again? What's that? What's that? Oh, no. It's an avalanche. - We're saved. - Unusual weather we're having. Tom, Jerry, look out. Tom and Jerry, eh? Well, you've both earned my wrath. Ahh! This isn't over. I'll get you Tom and Jerry, and that little girl, too. Good work, guys. Now, come on, let's catch up to Dorothy. Someone always helps that girl. But I'm still great enough to conquer her. To the Emerald City, as fast as lighting. Oh, Tom, Jerry. How did you two get here? The twister brought them here with you. Name's Tuffy, Miss Dorothy. And I came along because I want the Wizard... ...to give me some height, on account of I'm so small. Oh, I see. Well, my new friends want to see the Wizard, too. That's right. I'm hoping the Wizard will give me some brains. - I want a heart. - And I need some courage. And all Tom, Jerry, Toto and I want is to get back home to Kansas. Then what are we waiting for? Let's get to the Emerald City. I'm afraid there's no denying I'm small but I'm not crying It's gonna be all right I'd be tall as a giant I'd be big and self-reliant I'd be smart and rather pliant If the Wizard's not defiant And will serve Then I'm sure to get a brain - A heart - A home Some height We're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz We hear he is a wiz of a wiz If ever a wiz there was We're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz Look, Emerald City is closer and prettier than ever. Oh, my. Simply amazing. We're nearly there. Come on. I'm feeling smarter already. Come on, let's go. Cabby. Cabby. Just what you're looking for. Take you anyplace in the city, we does. - Will you take us to see the Wizard? - The Wizard? I can't. Well, yes, but first I'll have to take you to a little place... ...where you can tidy up a bit, what? Oh, thank you so much. We've been gone such a long time. And we feel so miser... What kind of a horse is that? I've never seen a horse like that before. No, and never will again, I fancy. There's only one of him, and he's it. He's the horse of a different color you've heard tale about. Ha ha ha, ho ho ho And a couple of tra-la-las That's how we laugh the day away In the merry old land of Oz Buzz buzz buzz, chirp chirp chirp And a couple of la-di-das That's how the crickets crick All day In the merry old land of Oz We get up at 12 And start to work at 1 Take an hour for lunch And then at 2 we're done Jolly good fun Ha ha ha, ho ho ho And a couple of tra-la-las That's how we laugh the day away In the merry old land of Oz Ha ha ha, ho ho ho Ha ha ha ha ha That's how we laugh the day away With a ha ha ha and a ho ho ho In the merry old land of Oz Come on along, folks. Look. "Surrender Dorothy." Well, at least she's forgotten about you two. Oops, my mistake. She's still pretty mad at you. Dorothy? Who's Dorothy? - And who's Tom and Jerry? - The Wizard will explain it. To the Wizard. Dorothy, we'd better see the Wizard right away. Oh, I think you're right. Jerry, please find Tom and follow us. You can't run away, Tom. You promised you'd protect Dorothy. I am Oz, the great and powerful. Who are you? Halt. No one can see the great Oz. But we're with Dorothy. The... The Witch's Dorothy? She's already inside with the Wizard. Don't worry, now. I know it sounds bad, but I assure you... ...the great Oz is wise and benevolent and kind. Of course, sometimes he does get a little ticked off. What happened inside, Miss Dorothy? Are you going home? Will Scarecrow get his brain? Will I get to be big? Oh, Tuffy, the Wizard says he won't do anything for any of us. Not unless Dorothy brings him the Wicked Witch's broomstick. But to do that, she'd have to kill the Witch. Oh, this is terrible, terrible. That's right, Tom. You give that Wizard a piece of your mind. Oh. Tom's a lot braver than I thought. Okay, let's go get that witch. "Witches castle, one mile. I'd turn back if I were you." At last, I've got that girl right where I want her. And Tom and Jerry, too. Take your army to the haunted forest... ...and bring me that girl, her dog, and especially that cat and mouse. Now, fly. Fly. Well, what's happened to you? They took my legs off and threw them over there. They took my chest out and threw it there. Well, that's you all over. They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they? They took Dorothy and Toto and Tom and Jerry... ...and we gotta follow them. - What a nice little dog. - No! Oh, Toto. And you, my dear, what an unexpected pleasure. It's so kind of you to visit me in my loneliness. Now, give me those ruby slippers or your dog goes into the river. No, please. Take the slippers. What a good little girl. I knew you'd listen to reason. I should have remembered. Those slippers will never come off as long as you're alive. But that's not what's worrying me, it's how to do it. These things must be done delicately... ...or you'll hurt the spell. - Run, Toto, run. - Catch him, you fool. Do you see that? It's how long you've got to live. And it isn't long, my dear. Wanna play ball, Jerry? Tom, Jerry. That's the last of them. I'll come back for you just as soon as those sands run out. Yo he ho Yo ho And halt. Excellent work, new guard. - Any questions so far? - Yeah. What does that "Yo He Ho" song mean? I have absolutely no idea. Let's review what we learned today. "Rule one: Winkie guards must keep track of their hours... ...and submit a timecard at the end of the week." Something wrong, new guard? Okay, then. "Rule two: Winkie guards receive one personal day... ...every 3O0 years. Rule three, and this is the most important rule of all... ..."Guards must keep all water away from the Wicked Witch. It's her one weakness." Got that? Sir, I think we have a couple of escaped prisoners. Well, how about that? You're having a busy first day, new guard. I salute you. It's them. Oh, dear. Seize them. I'm afraid this won't look good on your personal evaluation. You know, I'm just a guard... ...but I take my responsibilities very seriously. It's not a glamorous job... ...but a good guard always does the very best he can. If you come along quietly... ...l'll try to get you an extra ration of gruel. - Gotcha. - Arrest them, old new guard. You better not try any of your tricks. They won't work twice. Are you sure you completed basic training? - Tom, Jerry, it's us. - Boy, are we glad to see you. Toto found us and led us back here. Where's Dorothy? "Witch." "Slippers." "Ouch." She's locked in the tower with only moments left to live. Auntie Em. Dorothy, where are you? It's Aunt Em, we're looking for you. Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away. I'm frightened. Come back. - Come back. - I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty. Toto will find Dorothy. Come on. There's more? You mean that water is the Witch's one weakness? I'll take that. You and Tom find some more water. I'll go with the others and try to save Dorothy. Good luck, fellers. This way. Wait, I have an idea. Dorothy, are you in there? I'm here. Oh, please hurry. The Witch will be back when the hourglass is empty. I'll handle this. Stand back. We haven't much time. Hi. Oh, Dorothy, we found you. Oh, thank you. Oh. Come on, there's no time to lose. Oh, run. We're trapped, don't you know? I'll handle this. Who dares disturb my cookie time? That's right. That's what you get when you mess with a big munchkin. Very impressive. Now run. What are you guys doing? We need that water, fast. Come on. Whoa! We're safe. Going so soon? Why, our little party's just beginning. We're trapped. Trapped like mice, rats. That's right. Don't hurt them right away, let them think about it a little first. Ha! Seize them. Seize them. Seize them. Stop them, you fools. Seize them. Seize them. Guys. What? Stop fooling around. Dorothy needs that water. Hmm. Ah-ha! There. Water. This way. Come on. Oh, my. That way. Hyah! Whoa! Well, well. Ring around the rosie, a pocket full of spears. Thought you were pretty foxy, didn't you? Ha-ha-ha! Fill it up. The last to go will see the first four go before her. No. How about a little fire, Scarecrow? Oh, no. I'm burning. I'm burning. Jerry, quick, the water. I'm burning. Help me. I'm burning. Help. Don't throw that water. You cursed brat, look what you've done. I'm melting, melting. What a world. Who could have thought a good little girl like you... ...would destroy my beautiful wickedness? Look out. I'm going. She's dead. You killed her. I didn't meant to kill her. Really, I didn't. It's just that he was on fire. Hail to Dorothy, the Wicked Witch is dead. Hail, hail to Dorothy, the Wicked Witch is dead. The broomstick. - May we have it? - Of course you can. You've freed us all from the Wicked Witch. Now I can go back to my old job as a haberdasher. Hail to Dorothy. Hail, hail to Dorothy. The Wicked Witch is dead. Why have you come back? Please, sir. We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. Dorothy melted her. You liquidated her, eh? - Shh! So you see, sir, we'd like you to fulfill your promises to us. Not so fast. Not so fast. I'll have to give the matter a little thought. Go away and come back tomorrow. What? But I want to go home now. Do not arouse the wrath of the great and powerful Oz. I said come back tomorrow. If you were really great and powerful... ...you'd keep your promises. Do you presume to criticize the great Oz? You ungrateful creatures. The great Oz has spoken. What? Hey. No. Stop th... Stop that. Whoa! Oh, l... Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain. The great Oz has spoken. - Who are you? - I? Oh, I am the great and powerful... ...Wizard of Oz. - You humbug. - Yeah. I'm afraid you're right. I am a humbug. What about the heart that you promised Tin Man? And the courage you promised Cowardly Lion? Don't forget the most important thing. He promised he'd get Dorothy back home to Kansas. Yeah. My diminutive friend, you force me into a cataclysmic decision. The only way to get Dorothy back home to Kansas... ...is for me to take her there myself. Oh, will you? Could you? I will, indeed. But first, I'll fulfill my promises to each of you. Tuffy, too? He was going to ask you to make him big. Yes, Tuffy, too. My friends, I, your wizard... ...am about to embark upon a hazardous journey... ...into the outer stratosphere. And I hereby decree that in my absence... ...the Scarecrow shall rule by virtue of his highly superior brain. The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle... ...is equal to the square root of the remaining side. Oh, joy. Rapture. Assisted by the Tin Man by virtue of his heart... ...the Lion, by virtue of his courage. Ain't it the truth? And Tuffy, by virtue of his enormous height. I'm huge. Obey them as you would me. Oh! Oh, Toto. Please don't go, I'll be right back. Oh, but this is a highly irregular procedure. This is absolutely unprecedented. Boys, please. We don't want to keep the Wizard waiting. Oh! Oh, my. Come back, come back. Don't go without me, please come back. I can't come back. I don't know how it works. Goodbye, folks. Goodbye, Wizard, goodbye. Now I'll never get home to Kansas. Goodbye, Wizard. Stay with us. We don't want you to go. Look, here's someone who can help you. Oh, will you send me home? Can you send me home? You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas. I have? Now those ruby slippers will take you home in two seconds. Tom and Jerry and Toto, too? Tom and Jerry and Toto, too. Just tap your heels three times... ...and think to yourself, "There's no place like home." "There's no place like home." - There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. - You just had a bad dream. - Sure you did. You remember us, don't you? And you couldn't forget your old pal Tuffy, could you? Or me, the local haberdasher. Well, she's all right now, thank heaven. Oh, but I wasn't all right, Aunt Em. We were in terrible danger. But we kept asking people to send us home. And they sent us home. Doesn't anyone believe me? Anyway, it's all right, because I'm home again... ...and this is my room and I love you all. And, oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home.
