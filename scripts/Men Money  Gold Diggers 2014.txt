"It's The Sandra Winslow Show." Here's Sandra! Hello and welcome to "The Sandra Winslow Show." I'm your host Sandra Winslow. Whoo hoo! Yes, now I hope you're ready for the sizzling questions and hot topics that you'll find right here on the only show that brings truth and romance face-to-face. Today's hot topic: A gold mine or a gold digger... which one do you have? Well, joining us today are two special guests who are ready to put their relationship to the test. He's a financial advisor and she's a former fashion model. Please help me welcome Caleb Peterson and Paisley Terrell! Hi! Hello. Hey, Sandra, how are you? Wonderful. Well, don't you two make just the cutest pair? Thank you so much for coming to the show. Well, thank you for having us. We're really so excited. You see, Caleb and Paisley have agreed to discuss what makes their relationship so successful. So tell us, how do you make it work? Not only is Caleb a rare breed, he is the epitome of every woman's dream. He is sexy, he is driven, he is successful, he makes me laugh... and he spoils me rotten. You wanna say anything, baby? Yeah, thanks, baby. See, a relationship is simple, Sandra. You take two people who really care for one another, throw them into a pot, stir that up with a whole lot of trust and sprinkle it with a handful of tender, loving care and you get a dish made from the finest ingredients in the world. We call that a recipe for love. Oh, that is so beautiful. See, all this talk about gold diggers really doesn't apply to me. - Oh? - I mean, thanks to my GDDS. Your GDD-what? Gold Diggers Detection Sensor. Oh, it's a radar for gold diggers, a little skill I developed hanging out at the clubs. Okay. See, a man with money is like a walking ATM machine. But you better believe that when it come to me, Caleb Peterson, ATM stands for Another Trick Misled. Ooh! Well, my goodness. Well, I am so proud of you. I mean, you guys have seemed to really build a strong relationship built on trust and void of all the drama and girl, you know we know there's plenty of drama out there. Yes, we do. But we are determined to the go the distance. - Yes, we are. - The distance? Well, ding ding dong, do I hear wedding bells in the distance? Uh, well, we have talked about it. I must admit it, I have always dreamed about the day where my very own chocolate Prince Charming would carry me off and take care of me for the rest of my life. Well, baby, that day is here. Oh my God! What are you doing, Caleb? Are, are, are you... are we about to have a proposal right here on my show? That's right, baby. I want the whole world to see that when a man loves a woman the way I love you, he has to be willing to take it to the next level with her. Baby, you make me feel like Hercules and Rockefeller wrapped in one. Paisley, baby, will you marry me? - Yes! - Yes. Yes, Caleb, of course I'll marry you. Come here, boy. Oh, so wonderful. Wow. Now listen, though, we all know that money issues are the leading cause of divorce, so, so Caleb, what about your financial security? I mean, are you thinking of asking for a prenuptial agreement? A prenup... Oh, that's just silly. We're not Russell and Kimora or Babyface and Tracey. You talking to Caleb and Paisley. We got that soft ghetto puff, puff, pass kind of love. Well, it, it appears Caleb has just learned to say no, Paisley. You want me to sign a prenup? Baby, I mean, you know what's mine is yours and what's yours is mine, but... But what? Oh, we hear a but, a but. But I don't want half my money to be yours if we break up. So you wanna start a marriage thinking about the end? Well, now, she does have a good point there, Caleb. Baby, why would you want the woman that you claim to love to sign a prenup? Well, baby, that's my point. I'm trying to show everybody here that we love each other so much that you don't care about my money. No, what you're trying to show everybody is that you care more about your money than this relationship. That's not true. Baby, what is love if you don't wanna invest in it? Paisley, are you saying then there is a part of you that wants Caleb's money? No... Yes... No. Well, damn, Paisley... Which one is it? Maybe our next guest will help us answer that question. Paisley's best friend Trina James! Hey, Sandra! Have a seat, have a seat. Uh oh, there go my Gold Digger Detection Sensor. Girl, you better not sign no prenup. Digger, digger... Digger, digger. Oh, shut up, Caleb. You wouldn't be worried about no so-called "digger digger", if you wasn't wearing all those Rolexes, driving fancy cars and buying all them high-end expensive ugly-ass clothes. What? You are simply attracting what you are. Uh, you know what? If a woman wasn't looking for a bulls eye, then what I'm wearing wouldn't be a target. Please. Black men are just mad that sisters are finally making our step up to the plate. Thank you. And what is wrong with stepping up to the plate? It's too damn high. Caleb's brother Damon! I told you she wouldn't sign no prenup. You can't trust her. I knew you had something to do with this. Okay, all women want a man with money, Damon. And all men have the right to protect themselves. Exactly. But they have a responsibility to protect their woman first. That's right. Caleb, if you ain't no punk, you better holler, "We want prenup." - We want prenup! - We want prenup! Caleb, I am not signing a prenup. - Then we have a problem. - Tell 'em, bro.' Wow. Okay, if you don't want to pay the million-dollar price, then why you looking for a Halle Berry clone? This been going on since the beginning of time. - All right, if Eve didn't trick Adam... - Trick? Yeah, that's right... Trick, trick. We wouldn't be having this conversation. - Did you just call me a trick? - Yep. If Adam had been more of a man, he wouldn't have let his woman out of his sight when there was a damn snake running around the Garden! Hello. Well, she obviously wanted to be... With her own kind! And on that note, we'll close this segment of the show. Remember, ladies and gentlemen, there is a thin line between a gold mine and a gold digger, so ask yourself which one are you? I'm Sandra Winslow and that's our show. Whoo hoo! I'mma be a star, I'mma be a what. I'mma be a star, I'mma be a what. I'mma be a star and I don't give a... 'cause I'm gonna be a star. Go Trina, go Trina. Go Trina, go Trina. Go Trina. Yeah, you sure are a star. Ooh, hey, hey, hey, sexy. Yeah... Trina, right? Mm-hmm. Trina, Bonita, Shaquita, I'll be whoever you want as long as you keep that shirt unbuttoned just like that. Really... Well, I'm Lionel, Trina. Okay, well, you 'bout to be dinner if you don't cover up this entre. I'm sorry, my bad. I thought I was working here alone today. Yeah, Okay. - Well, you 're lucky I don't bite you. - Really? I don't have a problem with that. Long as you don't mind if I bite you back. Ooh, you better tame yourself, Mr. Wild Kingdom, before this turns into an episode of When Animals Attack up in here. Oh, really... Really? You mean something like this. So what are you, Caleb's frat brother... Business partner? Oh, no... The plumber. Ooh, you pushing a Hummer, that's what up! You got the H2, the H3? What you pushing? The H2O, as in water. I'm his plumber, baby... Plumber? Ah, hell, you ain't got no money. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why do you say that? I mean, I don't do too bad. Yeah, you don't do too good either, sweetie. Mm-mm... No. I can't believe you brought me on national TV to tell me you wanted me to sign a prenup. I was with you when you had nothing, Caleb. Yeah, but Baby, when I had nothing, I still had more than half the people out there. You didn't meet me on the street corner, Paisley. We met on an exclusive getaway cruise to Trinidad. Okay, I was on that cruise too. How you think I got there? Uh, the other dude? The other... Look, point being... I was trying to get away from one heartbreak and it feels like all I'm doing is running into another one. Baby, that dude didn't do nothing but wine and dine his way into your heart. He iced you so much that he left you frozen in place. But I was the one who defrosted you, baby. You was cold and depressed. I was the one who put the warmth back into your life. I'm feeling a chill up in here right now. - Chill out, please. - That's corny. Chill the hell out. Bobby might not have been the best man for me... See, now, now, why you gotta mention his name? See, I didn't say his name. I said "that dude." But no, you had to go and say Bobby. How you gonna disrespect me in my crib like that, Paisley? - Come on. - Do you hear yourself? Your crib? Your life? Your money. At least Bobby shared more with me than what he had to offer in the bedroom. Offering in the bedroom... This ain't about sex. Yeah, but most of the time it is though. - Uh, Lionel... - I'm gonna check on the leak though. Let me get the leak. Paisley. It's just a formality, baby. It's like, it's like when Dedra has to sign forms for me at work. Gosh. Dedra? See, uh-huh, read him girl. Let him have it... Let him know. Do not compare me to your little corporate mistress. Oh, don't start with that. Please. Dedra and I are strictly business, just like this prenup, baby. I told you, no they not. No, they not, no, they not, no, they not. They're not business, they're not nothing. Listen, Caleb. A man with money is wonderful, but a six-figure man with a $2 heart isn't worth a dime to me. That's right, girl. If you want to participate, set him straight! How about you relocate out my house? Baby, can you please get Gangsta Boo here to go somewhere else? Gangsta Boo? Trina James is 100% a super modern, classy kind of chick, okay? Check yourself. I'm sorry, but ain't nothing classy about a woman who screams out in the middle of a sermon, "You better preach, nooka." Um, I was hyping him up. Preachers love that. No, rappers love that. Listen, Paisley, I'm about to go. I've been kicked out of better places. Little man over here is always asking somebody to leave, standing in somebody's business. I told you before. I told you once, I told you twice. He's jealous of our friendship. Man, sound like you got more problems around here to worry about than just your plumbing. Nah, man, ain't got no problems. A woman is just like a boomerang. You know how to toss her right, she always come back around, you know? Yeah, well, maybe you need to check your technique. Looks like she done lost her sense of direction. Hey, I pay you to repair my cribs, not my relationships. How much do I owe you? You're right... You know what? After seeing what I seen today, this one's on the house, bro. - Thank you. - All right, man. Why you always gotta put her down like that? Because birds of a feather flock together. And I don't want her gangsta booness rubbing off on you, baby. Look, I mean, I'm moving up in the corporate world and I need my woman, my wife... Hmm. To uphold a certain image. What image? You know, soccer mom. Charity functions. Company picnics. The corporate life of a corporate wife. You know, the heads of the firm are real strict about this wholesome image thing. Mmm, I see. Well, you know, I think that you forgot to tell them that your fiance is a vixen. - Vixen? - Mm-hmm. You trying to get it started? You trying to... Oh, baby, wait, wait, wait, wait. You need... no, I gotta stay focused now. I'm nervous, okay? Today is my first official day as junior partner at Smith, Jolly and Rancher. How do I look, baby... I'm looking good? Watch me now. Watch me... This is my Denzel walk. Mm, mm, mm. Bam! Look at this... Bam! That's for "Ebony" right there. - And boom. - What's that? "Playgirl.." You so crazy. Crazy about you, baby. Just give it some time, okay? I just need to know that you're with me for me and not my money. Caleb, this is my paradise. I wouldn't do anything to mess that up. People change. Paradises fade. Prenups stay the same. - I'll think about it. - That's my girl. That's what I'm talking about. Let me see... you know what? Let me see if I can get you to give me a yes. Come here... Come here. Come here. Mm, mm, come here. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. Aw, you're adorable. Thank you, baby. I gotta get to work. All this is for you. You're the reason I'm doing this now. - All right? - Have a great day. Thank you, baby. Executive assistant to the junior partner. Okay. Okay, picture goes here. Okay and this goes here. All right. Right there. He'll need to sign this later. Put it right there. Okay. All right. Ooh. Mmm, that is comfy. This can't be that hard. Smith, Jolly and Rancher, this is Caleb Peterson speaking. Oh, hey, Paisley, baby. Oh, yes, I'll buy you a BMW. Oh, yes, baby, of course we can go to Paris. Bam! What? No, we can't get married until you sign that prenup, trick! Maybe that's how I should say it. Sorry. You scared me. You obviously saw the show this morning. I did. And, uh, as your assistant who knows a lot about women, Paisley's not going to sign her life away. Caleb, you want to date these high-maintenance women and you expect them to be honorable. Paisley's a good woman, Dedra. Okay. Good woman, huh? That's, that's debatable. And she's beautiful. Men always say that. You know Lionel the janitor told me that on the way in this morning? Yeah, but Paisley's got that cover girl, supermodel type of beauty, you know? Oh, yeah. That's right. Yeah, because in your world, two degrees, closed knees and a Bible don't mean nothing. For you, it's two-inch waist, cover girl face and a big booty to chase, right? Why you trying to psychoanalyze me? I don't have to analyze what I already know. - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm. Well, since we're being so analytical and poking our little noses into other people business, - why you don't have a man? - What? Yeah, ever since what's-his-face broke up with you... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. He did not break up with me. The decision was mutual. Yeah, well, whatever it was, I haven't seen you with a man since then. Well, maybe I spend all my hours working for you. Oh! Oh, so now your being single is my fault. Okay. Maybe some men find my commitment to your success just a little intimidating. You know what? I don't have time for this. Can you please just get my office together? I gotta get to work. Well, thank you for noticing. - Oh, uh, thanks. - Mm-hmm. Good job. Did you take care of my... Bills for the month... Paid. - What about changing... - Voicemail? It now says, "Office of Caleb Peterson, junior partner." I like the way that sounds. And the parking arrangements? Been there, done that. Oh, good, then you got enough time to send... Send flowers to Paisley? Yeah, she should be receiving those in like, oh, five, four, three, two and... Caleb Peterson. Oh, hey, Paisley, baby. Oh, yeah, I know. But you know, it's always the little things that count. Yeah. I love you too. All right. Wait, how did you... I did tell you that I saw the show this morning, right? So I just figured that you'd want to send some flowers to smooth things over. Damn, look at you. - What would I-- - Do without me? I, I really don't know. Probably finish one of my own sentences. Shoot. I mean, why do you look so surprised? Five years together, you would figure I would know something about you. Oh, you don't know everything. What color underwear I'm wearing? I'm just kidding. Um, hmm. Blue. Calvin Klein. Button fly boxer briefs with the signature logo on the waistband and might I say, a little too tight? You should really think about a bigger size because if you could breathe a bit, you might not be walking around here so uptight. - I'm just saying. - You know what? I don't know whether to fire you for sexual harassment or take that as a compliment. Well, just like you say, I'm just doing my job, sir. Oh, wait. Speaking of big offices, your brother called and said he'll be here in a minute. Damn, forgot about that. Why does he need your office? Uh, to meet with another one of his freak show clients. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Who is it this week? I dunno, he said it's a secret. Oh. Okay. Well, um, wish him luck for me. Wait a minute, where you going? You're not just going to leave me to deal with this nonsense by myself. He's coming, he's coming... Get up, get up. - Hey, Damon. - Hey, how you doing, Dedra? - What are you talking-- - Come on, it's gotta look like my office. Hey, hey, man, don't you do nothing crazy in my new executive leather chair... I just got that. Man, stop playing and get into character, he's almost here. - I don't see anybody... - Where is he? He's walking up, you don't see him? Where? Look it. Yeah, I'm here to see Damon Peterson. Damon, what the hell you doing? Damon? I'm Sway. - Sway. - Yeah. You know, like a boat rocking back and forth? I'm so smooth, I sway. Oh, so I get it. You're the new artist. Depends. Depends on what ya'll got to offer. I'm already giving you money. Come on, playboy. You're probably giving Damon some money. I'm Sway. - You know, like a boat rocking. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it. That's it... I like her. So, what ya'll got to offer a brother? Uh, I need to consult with my brother, but he seemed to disappear... somewhere. Hold on, man, I'm on the phone. Oh, yeah, yeah, we'd love to do the Usher remix. Yeah, yeah. Talk to you soon, Mr. Face. Mr. Babyface, that is. All right, playboy. What'd I miss? - Look, Sway, you-- - What? You know, like sway, right? No, I'm Damon. CEO of Just Us Records? Oh, so now you're Damon. Of course I'm Damon, bro. We've been brothers for about, what, 30 years? I think the junior partner thing is starting to mess with your mind... Man, what's the matter with you? What's the matter with me... You the one lost your damn mind. No, it seems like ya'll got some crazy dysfunctional sibling rivalry thing going on. I'll check back with ya'll later. Uh, Damon, Sway, whoever the hell you are right now. You cannot be an artist and run the company. Come on, bro... it can be done. Think about Jay-Z, huh? Look, you take care of the finances. Me, I'll book the talent. You mean booking yourself. Yeah, yeah. See, I told you I like her. Or was that Sway? Look, Damon, I didn't put my money into this for you to be a star. We put our money together so we can make stars, man. Well, let's make Sway a star. I'm telling you, man, he is the one. I feel it. I feel him. You know, like you say you feel about Paisley, only this is real. You know what, you're wrong for that, but you know what, see, I've heard this a thousand times before, Damon. What are you talking about? First it was the, uh, Siamese twins boy band. What were they called? - Connected? - They was hot. They was just a little before their time. Then it was the gay, blind country rapper. - Boy Charles? - Boy Charles. How was I supposed to know the brother was blind? - And now it's you! - No, now it's Sway. And I'm telling you, he got some skills. The ladies will love it. Damon, you took third place in a talent showcase with only one person in it. Why you gotta bring that up? I was just starting to get over it. I'm just saying, man, you know, you get stage fright. That's why I created Sway! Look, when I'm him, I ain't scared of nothing. Cross this line, son, I'll knock your ass out. Man, take these damn things off. You know you can't fight. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I mean, that's brilliant. The whole alter ego thing. I mean, that could work. Who's gonna pay for it? Come on, man, give it a shot. Look, let me perform at your engagement party. Now, if I'm wack, you won't hear another word. If I'm hot, you promise to back me, huh? That sounds fair to me. Dedra? But what do I know? I'm just a little old assistant and ain't nobody ringing no wedding bells for me. All right, man, you can perform. But look, don't you mess this up. Now can you please get your schizophrenic butt out of my office? I've got to get to work now. All right, all right, all right, don't be pushing on me, man. I'll tell Sway. Man, get out of here. Oh, like, oh my God, you guys are, like, so cute together. You know what? Just 'cause it's cute don't mean it won't kill you. I just hope he don't mess up my engagement party. Are you coming? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, of course. Um, Caleb? Mm-hmm. There's an opening in the London office and the partners think that... I should apply. What... London? You're kidding, right? No. I mean, there's not anything really left for me here. There's plenty. We just got here. We got a good thing going. You can't just leave. Look, tell me what you want and you got it. I don't think you can give it to me, Caleb. I forbid you to leave. If you leave, you're fired. Okay, see, this is why I didn't want to tell you. You overreact to everything. I'm just thinking about it. Who put you up to this? Nobody! Okay, look, I'm here now, so let's just enjoy the moment. - Cool? - Cool. Now, I want you looking your best, right? Hold on. Come on, your mama would be upset with you, Mr. Junior Partner. All right. Thank you. Wait, wait, wait. - What? - Come here. Come here. What? I want you looking your best too, Miss Junior Partner Assistant. My junior partner assistant. - Caleb! - What? Stop it! What is it? Look, why you wanna leave all this? Huh? Caleb, what are you doing? I promised myself I'd do this when I made partner. This is your world, honey. Okay, and as your friend, I am telling you, you are not signing no prenup. Hmm. You have been there for Caleb through thick and thin. - Yeah, I have. - Uh-huh. That's what I'm trying to tell you. You gotta have some kind of insurance policy on him. I got an idea. Someone to make him jealous. Oh, uh-uh, Trina. I am done with games. Yoo hoo, Sister Winslow in the building! Yoo hoo! I'll be right back, I gotta talk to her. Sandra, you look nice with... when you dress up like that! You had a great show today, Sandra. Ooh, come here. I was thinking, you ought to let me co-host. Honey, me and you could me the new Oprah and Gayle! No, no, no, I don't need another co-ho... st. How did she break that up? Paisley, congratulations, sweetie. Thank you. You know you started something, right? Oh, guilty as charged, but my ratings went through the roof, honey. Mm, at the expense of our relationship. Well, you know what they say. Every good relationship needs to go through a challenge or two. Who says that? I say that. Whoo, you ladies look good! Mmm. Can I get ya'll something to drink? Lionel, you a waiter, too? Yeah, just a little something-something I do on the side... What can I get you? How many sides you got? Mm, however many you think you can handle, baby. Please. Tell this man it's going to take more than a tray table and plumber to drain these pipes. Perhaps you'd like a screwdriver, baby... I'll have a Merlot. That's what you gonna get. If I was your co-host, I would have let you know it's Mer-lot. You see what I'm saying? Me and you could do good together. I would let you know, if I was the co-host. Do you speak French? Speak of the devil and he will show his face. See that? I told you you might be his trophy wife, but that thing there, that's his girlfriend and why you getting shelved, guess who gonna be getting slipped up under your bed sheets? Yup... Ugly Betty. Betty le fea! What's up? - We need to talk. - About what? Why are you gonna come up in here with her like that? People looking at ya'll like ya'll are the ones engaged. What people, you and Trina? Congratulations, you two. I'm sure heaven is so excited about this union. Thank you. And I'm sure hell can't wait for you to come back home. - Sorry about that. - It's okay, Caleb. As Mama always said, never back a woman in a corner 'cause you never know when you find a tramp. What'd you say... Did you say, "tramp?" Is something wrong with you? Ladies and gentlemen, Just Us Records would like to showcase some of our new talent, so please, put your hands together for my friend, my homie, Sway. Who you... Oh, he's Sway! Let me see! Hey, I like this! Yeah. "I like her this and that, that." "Make my heart pitter pat, pat." "She blows a kiss at Sway." "Then waits for him to come tap that." "I like the cat on that, that" "it's yummy too she glad, glad." "I hate to see her mad man" "it makes me like a mad man." "I dress up like a bad man." "Tie up the nearest ad man." "I hold him hostage." "Till they send in Kevin Spacey grandad." "I'm just saying I get off of my rocker." "When she in the bad mood." "Or when we round some cockblockers." "I need it like clockwork." "On call." "I'll agree to stop being a jerk" "if you agree to have a ball." "Matter of fact why don't you just go and have them both" "but you don't you get too greedy baby" "save some room for more" "cause I got that G-D for you baby" "you got that boom, boom, boom." "Go and grab the "Troni." "And meet me inside the boom boom room." "I'mma warm the room up and." "Zoom up inside your boom boom boom." "So don't you get to acting all shy... why."

"And boom go the dynamite." "She got that dynamite." "Not just things I kinda like." "But what I'd fantasize about if it were 25 to life." "Yeah she fine, all right." "She's throwing curves like baseball." "Meaning you can hit it if your time is right." "She's so sexy that what might start off as kinda like." "Might turn into whoa, whoa, whoa." "You just can't show it any time of night." "I'm not the silent type." "In fact I'm kind of violent like." "Cause I boom, boom, boom that boom, boom, boom." "Until she like Sway you got that boom, boom, boom." "That boom, boom, boom." "That boom, boom, boom." "Yeah baby until you make it boom, boom, boom." "Go boom, boom, boom." "Go boom, boom, boom." "She got that, she got that boom, boom, boom." "That boom, boom, boom that boom, boom, boom." "Yeah girl 'cause Sway will make you boom, boom, boom." "Go boom, boom, boom go boom, boom, boom." "And boom go the dynamite." Whoa, man, that was off the hook! - You like that? - Yeah! That was so great. Thank you, thank you. Man, I told you, I told you I am somebody. I don't care what nobody say, I'm signing me. It's going down. I told you. I told you that was a brilliant idea. You did, you did. Yeah, well, you know, it's been a really long evening at the office. I think I'm just going to turn in a little early tonight. I'm incredibly, incredibly tired. Get a life. - Baby. - Get a degree. Okay. What is wrong with your friend? I dunno... Drama. That boom, boom, boom! - I like it! - You like it? Yeah, so you gonna put me in your video, right? Girl, nah, I need some experienced hos, not no wannabes... Excuse me. What are you talking about? I am experienced. Damon! Did he just... did he just call me a ho? I want you to try this, baby. I made it just for you. Oh, no, I ain't trying that. You're making something and trying to take advantage of me. Exactly! Now take it today! Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, gather 'round because I would like to propose a toast' to Caleb and Paisley on their glorious engagement, which of course, you know, was announced on my show. Yes, it was. Be blessed, you two and may you live happily ever after. Amen to that. Bobby? What's he doing here? Who is this? Hey, man, this party is invitation only. Sorry, I just came by to say congratulations to Paisley. No, you better do it by email or Facebook or something, because you ain't welcome here, brah. What's up, partner? Look, man, I'm just in town for a hot second. I saw your little episode on the TV show and I'm glad to see you two worked it out. I'm happy for you. Appreciate that. These are for you. Keys? Bobby, why do I need keys? Caleb already has the keys to my heart. He may have the keys to your heart, but these keys are to the Porsche I have parked out front. Damn! What the hell? You bought me a Porsche? Uh, look, look here, brother. I hope you kept the receipt 'cause Paisley's already got a ride. I know you're not talking about that 1920 get-out-and-go-push car she got that you bought her. Uh, Trina, don't you know when to shut your damn mouth? Nope. Baby, he's just trying to show his appreciation, that's all. Baby, baby, what the hell you think you're doing? Forgive me, uh, Khalib, right? Wrong... it's Caleb. Well, whatever... Bobby. I know who you are. That's good. That means she hasn't forgotten. Look, man, you ain't got nothing to worry about. You got yourself a remarkable woman. Seems she got herself a good man, so congratulations. Registration's in your name. Swag! Oh my God. Girl, let's go! Let's go give it a test drive! A Porsche, honey, yeah! We got a Porsche! I don't think so. Give me the keys to this. Uh-uh, ain't happening, not today. Hurry up, let's go! Caleb, why are you being so childish? It was just a gift. Because ain't no man gonna come up in my house at my engagement party and buy my woman no damn Porsche. Yo, Caleb, why are you tripping? It's just a car, man. I'm tripping because ain't no brother gonna buy a woman a damn Porsche unless he wants something in return. Yup. Something like what, Caleb? I don't know, Paisley. Ain't got no keys... You tell me. I don't think I like what you're trying to say to me, Caleb. You see, it's her car, but I'm sure if you sign a prenup, she'll let you drive it. Hey... Ho cake. I'm sure if I shove my fist to the back of your throat, - I can snatch out your tongue. - Who are you talking to? - Can he talk to me like that? - I'm talking to you. It's fine. I will give back the keys. He was just trying to wish me well... wish us well. Us? I mean, then why is the registration in your name only if it's us? Damn, bro, you sound like you jealous. No, this ain't about jealous. I'm just saying, when is the last time you talked to this dude? Like, last year? - Last week. - What? Oh no, beat her. Beat her ass... Use my belt. When was you planning on tell me this, Paisley? I didn't think it mattered. Look, let's just forget everything ever happened and just enjoy it. Enjoy what, Paisley? My future wife entertaining her ex-love? That's right. My ex-love. You're just gonna have to trust me. I told you it would work, girl. Another man in the picture and you're back in the driver's seat. Except only this time, that seat is attached to a Porsche. This is not what I wanted. Look, P, okay? Bobby has more money, he's ready to settle down and you're still in love with him. What's the problem? I am not in love with Bobby anymore. Oh really? Then why your eyes light up like floodlights every time you see him? - They do not! - They do. Look, you're single till you're married, girl. Give Bobby a chance. See what he's talking about. Ooh, that's my alarm. - Yep, gotta go. - Where you going? Girl, I met this rich doctor. He says that every time he sees me, he just feels like giving me a free check-up! I told him if his checkbook checks out then hell, he can spin me like a bottle. I don't care as long as he keeps paying that tab. Peace, girl, love you. - You too. - Call me! Come in. Trina, what did you forget? Bobby, you cannot keep popping up in here! What if Caleb was here? Oh, he's not here. No. But he will be when he gets back from work. I just had to see you. I got so excited when you called, I-l couldn't wait. I just called you to tell you that I can't keep the Porsche. It's too much. Not for you. Why are you showing me all this attention all of a sudden? 'Cause I miss having you in my life.' When I was in your life, I played second string to all these NBA clients. I was building my career. You should have built your career with me. I know. But you should have waited. You were supposed to go for LA for a week and then send for me. I sent you a plane ticket. Bobby, that was two years later! How much waiting can there be? Rome wasn't built in a day. Now I was trying to go from rich to wealthy. Well, you're too late 'cause I moved on. So move back. Let me make it up to you. You know I... I opened an office downtown. You did what? I thought you were just gonna... I know, you thought I was passing through. I just didn't want your little boyfriend raising no eyebrows. My fiance. What's in a title? Look, the point is, my clients come to me now. So I can come to you and give you anything you want. Not if I don't want it. You want to be with a man who wants you to sign a prenup when you could be with a man who's going to give you anything your heart desires. What my heart desires is somebody that's going to be there. And I will, woman. I will. I'm gonna love you. I'm gonna love you so deep that your grandma's grandma gonna feel it in her bones. Your knees are gonna buckle when I step in the room. Mmm. On your way out... Not even gonna think about your body. Gonna be making love to you so... I can't do this! - Come on. - No, it ain't right! Why are you trying to make this so hard on me? I was just trying to get you to follow your heart. What? That's all. Hmm? Look, Caleb's gonna be home! - You gotta go. - No, no. Then let's go to your crib. My what... Crib? House I bought you in the hills. What house? You bought me a house? That's right... Two stories. Filled with your wildest fantasies. Bobby, I don't know... Whoa, you said two stories? We can make it three. All right... Say the word. Word. That's what I'm talking about. Let's go check it out, okay? Okay, but we gotta go! All right, all right, all right. Wait, wait, wait, my shoes. I gotta get my shoes. - Hey, baby. - Hey! What's wrong with you? I'm just so happy to see you. You act like you saw a ghost. How was your day, baby? It was long and hard. Mm-hmm, I know what you mean. - What? - Huh? What was long about your day? Nothing. Hey, come here. Come here. Come here. What's... what's wrong with you? Why you all wet? Not wet... Oh, wet. I, uh, I was just cleaning. I'm so hot. How about something to drink? Yes, God, yes. Can I have a... I would love a glass... - Excuse me? - Hennessy! - Hennessy? - Mm-hmm. You've been hanging out with Trina too long. How about some bottled water? Good... Go. Can you get it for me please? I'm so hot. Bobby. What's with all the screaming? Nothing, I'm just so excited to see this house. You're gonna love it too. Yes, you can tell me all about it in the car, okay? Okay, I'm going to take you there. I know, I can't wait. Okay... I'm just going to freshen up. - You can wait for me in the car. - All right, all right... Okay... Okay. Go! You wanna spring or sparkling? Just pick one. All righty then. - Thank you. - Okay. Menstruation cycle. Around and around we go. I'm going to go turn it in. I left my watch. Oh, baby, you shouldn't have! You bought me a watch? Hey, Bobby. - What are you doing here? - What the hell are you doing here? This is my house. That's my watch. What the hell is going on, Paisley? It's not what you think. Oh really? What is it then? He just happened to stop by. - For what? - For my woman. Well, too bad you're leaving with just your watch. Now get out before I add a beat down with it. Look, Caleb. We were just talking. Why don't you tell him about the crib I bought you? - What crib? - Stop, Bobby. What crib? Come on, don't be shocked. Everything she got up in here, I paid for. Bobby Tremaine is all over this house. Is that true, Paisley? Of course it's true. And all you gotta do is make a choice. Him or me? Bobby. Yo, man, what the hell do you think you're doing? What I've been waiting to do for the last two and a half years. Well, you're going to have to keep waiting because Paisley is already getting married. I know. To me. - You know what... - No, Caleb! Look, Bobby, I can't do this. Yes, you can. All you gotta do is make a decision. Who you gonna choose, Paisley? Him or me? Caleb! Hey! Damn, dog. What happened to your furniture? She took it. What? She took everything. Why? I told her to. Why? I didn't think she was really gonna do it. It was all tainted with her gold digging stench anyway. That's what I was trying to tell you. I told you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dedra told me that they fired you from the firm, ain't been out your house for a couple of weeks. Is that why you ain't been answering your phone? 'Cause I'm trying to call you all week. Ain't got no phone. Why not? She took it. She took the phone? What about your mobile? Disconnected. Hey, you think we could get those Siamese twins back? - Connected? - Yeah. They went solo. Oh... Good for them. Look, man. You said you were going to come with me to meet the record execs. Now get up. Ah, man, just do it without me, man. I can't do it by myself, man. - Get up. - Come on, man. All you have to do is put on your sunglasses and do your alter ego thing. I ain't got time for this right now, Caleb. We got way too much to do. Just give it up, Damon. It's over. What are you talking about? Look at me. I was on top of the world, man. Now what I got? Get up. Get your ass up... Come on! I'm tired of helping you, Damon. Don't act like I'm the one with the problems. I know I got problems. But as long as I can get you and all these other crabs off my back, I'm gonna be just fine. Mm-hmm... Know what? Crabs keep you down. I'm your brother, so I'm going to get you up. Get up... Come on, man. You better than this. Damon! Damon, what are you doing? Trying to shake some sense into this bum. Look, we gotta be there in two hours, man. Two hours. Damon. Okay, look, why don't you go and get ready? I will make sure he's there. Okay? Love what you've done with the place. I didn't ask for you, Dedra. I didn't ask for none of ya'll, so please just get out. I'm here to help, Caleb. You can't help me, so please just stop trying. You can get through this, you know. I don't want to hear that, Dedra, so just... just leave me alone. Fine. Fine... I'll go. Fine. - Just leave. - I am... Next week. I took the job in London. So you won't have to worry about me ever again. Just like all the rest. Just... just go. You know it's your fault, right? Caleb! You are better than this. You have all this love to give and you just keep letting it fall into the wrong hands. Caleb, what are you doing? I don't know. Would you please stop? What if I don't want to? I think you should. I'm feeling better already. Because you're drunk, Caleb! Make me sober. - I can't. - Why not? Because you don't know what you want. You know what I want. Just costs too much to have it. Well, if you would stop trying to buy it, maybe you wouldn't have all these problems. You know, it costs more than what's in your wallet, Caleb. Did you know that? I don't need a financial advisor, Dedra. All I want is for you to be here for me right now. Oh, be here? Oh, okay, because before, you wanted me to leave. Now you want me to stay. Caleb, love isn't a constant high. Sometimes, love isn't new, bright and expensive. Love is, is complex... and so simple sometimes. Just leave, Dedra. I can't do that. Why not... Everybody else did! Because I can't walk out on the man that I love. You hear me? Just let me rest in peace. You feel sorry for yourself. You lay there. Don't expect me to lay there with you because I have too much life to live. I'm so sorry. Come here. Come here. Get up. Shut up. I'm not gonna let you go. Ooh, now that's a ring. See, I told you. I'm jealous, girl. You got a real chance now living the dream life. Speaking of dream life, how is your free check-up? Oh, I didn't tell you? Oh, that dude is out of breath somewhere damn near unconscious. - Stop it. - What, my doctor needs a doctor. I'm serious. Gifts have been flowing in ever since, honey. Looks like you might have found your Mr. Perfect. Everything on the checklist checks out, so we'll see. All right, all right. Here you are. - Okay. - Lionel? - You work here? - This dude. Another little something-something I do on the side. Brother got bills, you know? And here's a special drink for a special lady. - Oh, thank you... this is him. Hello? - Hey, baby. - Baby? Good, how are you... I'm here with Paisley having coffee. What you doing? Why? I don't want to talk in person, I'm busy, babe. What's going on... You can tell me. Tell me now. Oh... Are you sure? Listen, you don't know me and I don't really know you so until you get your facts straight, don't call me again. Thank you. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Let's go. Paisley, let's go. We're not going anywhere until you talk to me. What, did he turn out to be a dog or something? What's wrong... What's wrong, huh? You need me to get somebody for you? What's the matter, Trina? The matter is that ya'll keep asking me what's the matter. Let's go... I'm fine. I'm good. I'm Trina James, I'm perfect. Right? Yes, yes. - You are as perfect as... - You know what? I'm fine. Let's go. Just forget it. It's going to be okay, Trina. All right? What's wrong? He found a lump, Paisley. In the middle of me making him feel like a man, he made me feel like less than a woman. What am I gonna do, girl? Trina, listen to me. You have to believe that you're going to get better. The power of life and death is in the tongue. You have to say it and you have to believe it. You have friends who care about you and love you. I'm just keeping it real. Oh, really? That's what my wife said and now she's gone because she was so-called keeping it real. Your wife passed away of cancer? Five years ago. And I took care of her every step of the way and I can take care of you. You can't help me, Lionel. - Yes I can! - How? Clean more sinks? Wait more tables? Yes, yes. Wash more cars, cut more grass, get five more jobs. I'm gonna do whatever it takes. That's sweet, Lionel, but you are not Prince Charming and this is not a fairy tale, so I'd really appreciate it if you'd stop acting like it. I have cancer... I'm gonna die. No, but, no... You don't know that! So what are gonna do, huh? I'm gonna live. I'm gonna live like there's no tomorrow 'cause there just might not be. - Trina, that's not the answer. - Trina, wait. Please let me do it. Trina! Trina! Hello. My answer's yes. Yes, let's do it. Do what? Get married. Oh, yeah, yeah. We will. Okay, well, we can do it tomorrow. I've been putting things in perspective and I don't want to wait any... Slow down, slow down. These things need to be planned out. We don't need a big wedding, Bobby. I've already got the ring, what are we waiting for? Exactly, right. So what's the rush? Why can't we just jump into this? You ever hear the saying ''Look before you leap?'' What? Since we last spent time, I had to make some, some big decisions. What are you talking about, Bobby? I'm talking about my wife. Your wife? Who the hell is she? Doesn't matter. What matters is I was hurt and you wouldn't take my calls. I had to be with somebody. How can you ask me to marry you when you're already married? When were you going to tell me that? When I got divorced. Which is when? I don't know. You don't know? It's complicated. I mean, look, this whole thing has been like a whirlwind. A whirlwind? What world were you in when you were in bed with me? Wasn't a whirlwind when you destroyed my relationship. You weren't in love with him. You don't know that! You might have appreciated the benefits... the house, the cars, the clothes. That's not why I was with him. Then why didn't you stay? I thought what we had was real, Bobby. You were my first love. But how could you do this to me? - Paisley. - No, I chose you. I chose you. You mean everything to me. I could have loved Caleb more. I could have given him more of me, but you're still in my heart. All right, all right. Let me make it right, okay? Every time I'm with her, I'm thinking about you. Then leave her. It's not the thing to do right now. And cheating is? I told her about us, okay? About the Porsche, the house in the hills, the furniture, the fact that we're going to get married. Bobby, why would you tell her all of that? I didn't know I was telling her. I must have been talking in my sleep. You know, or dreaming. I think about you 24/7. She threatened to take half if I leave her. Nah. You can still leave. And have her take half? I don't think so. If I'd had her sign a damn prenup, I wouldn't be having these problems. Look. I got my lawyers working on it. They'll let me know what my options are. Okay, so what am I supposed to do while your lawyers are working on your options? Bobby that could take years. I know. And I'm going to take care of you. You expect me to spend Christmas and holidays all by myself? You want me to sneak around with you so that I can lay with you so you can hold me at night? I don't want to be some bitter old person that's pissed that she gave her milk away for free. I may be married to her, but my heart is always with you. You know what... I would have been better off with Caleb 'cause at least I wouldn't have been getting half a man. I don't believe this. - Baby. - No. Bed your wife because I am done. We're over. Where's Dedra? Dropping the single off at the radio station. You know she's leaving tomorrow. Yeah. So? So what? So... you know, you're a genius when it comes to money and an idiot when it comes to love. She's there for the taking, man. Who, Dedra? Yeah... I mean, she's not thick the way I like them, but she ain't bad on the eyes either. No, it's not that, man. I like her just the way she is, but you know, we've been hanging out a lot lately and to tell you the truth, she touches me. She does? On the inside, Damon. Oh, okay, just asking. Just saying, don't leave a brother out. - You need therapy. - I just might. Hey... Hey, guys. Okay, I dropped the song off at the radio station. I talked to the program directors so I guess all we can do is just wait and see. Might as well get started. There's a radio in the back, right? Why are you looking at me like that? So are you... really going to London? There's nothing left for me to stick around for. What are you talking about? There's me. Why do you want me to stay? To, um, take your calls? To schedule your appointments? No... No. Okay, well, then why, Caleb? Why should I stay? - Dedra... - You know what, wait. Caleb. Now... I might not be the trophy girl and I might not be the cover girl supermodel that you are looking for, but I'm beautiful just the way that I am. Hey, hey. They just played our song on the radio, baby! Got to be kidding. Already... Why didn't you call us? I was so excited I couldn't believe it. I gotta call Sway. I mean, they said if it was good, they'd play it, but I didn't think they meant today. Hello? Hey, Sway? Hey, it's me, man. Man, they are playing our song all over the radio, baby. It is the number one requested song all morning. Man, I told you we was gonna make you a star. Didn't I tell you... Didn't I tell you? Oh, yeah, that's cool, player. I seen some honeys I want to celebrate with so I'mma get back at you. Sway's excited! We gonna blow up, man. We gonna blow up, girl. You did it... You did it. I'm gonna tell Sway to give you some. Come here, girl. Would you stop? Get off me. You're so crazy... I don't know where you or Sway... Oh... okay. I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I know you didn't, Caleb. Um. I'm going to go and finish packing because you know, I have some people that are coming to look at the house. But, um, I'm happy for you. Okay. Dedra, wait. I need you. I love you. What? You love me? Yes. I love you. So what? I've been loving you. I know... I know... I'm sorry. I'm not going to let the woman I love walk out on me. If I got to wake up every morning and prove how much I love you, I'm not letting you walk out. I have always loved you. And I need you in my life. No, I said we get to publish it. Yeah, well, I'll let you think about it, all right? There are plenty of other companies who would love to distribute this for us. I thought you would. All right, let's talk later. Yeah, like I was saying, we can take a look at her. I mean, if she's any good. But, uh, our A&R person gets last say. That's right. Dedra Simmons. All right, man. Later. Told you you'd be a hit. I am happy. How you doing there, boss? Hey, Lionel. Hey, listen, there's a package for you down in the lobby. You want me to sign for it? Yeah, sign for the package, Lionel. I'll do that... I'll do that, boss. - And Lionel? - Yes, sir, boss? Don't call me boss. Oh, you know what, boss? I'm never going to call you boss again. That's the last time I'm ever going to call you boss, boss. I'm sorry, Mr. Peterson. And if you don't mind me saying so, I think ya'll look good together. Well, thank you. Aw. Well, thank you, Lionel. But... but... business before pleasure. Where you going? I gotta follow up with video shoot location. Come here... What you doing? Oh, oh, oh. You see what I gotta deal with? Okay. See what I gotta deal with? And you are right, we cannot shoot in a prison. But, if, you know, you're good, I might let you frisk me later. What? That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about right there. - Lionel? - Yes, sir. - That's mine. - Oh, that is your package. I'll get the other one for you. Crazy. Trina, you cannot be in my video. Stop asking. I've been practicing and everything. That's my you can't handle this face. What you doing? That's my ''you still can't be in the video'' face. Damon, come on, please. You know I'm the right one for the video. Okay, okay... I'll think about it. Ain't promising nothing, but I'll think about it. - All right? - Okay. That's all I asked 'cause I've been practicing, I'm ready. And no. What do you mean no? You just said you would think about it. And I thought about it. Come on, that was too fast. Who told you I be doing it too fast? Alicia? She be lying. Caleb, Caleb, can I be in the video? That's Damon's department and, uh, Damon, I need the treatment for the video, please. I'm trying to work on, but Trina keeps harassing me. You're not even looking. - Sway. - No. - Sway. - Uh-uh. Look... I did this in the rodeo thing. Paisley! Where you been, girl? I've been trying to call you. I've been calling and calling. You look good. Hi, Caleb. Sorry, girl. I've just been taking some time off to think. I heard about, you know, Damon and Caleb's success. I just wanted to come by and wish them well. That was nice of you. - You look nice. - Thank you. Congratulations, Caleb. You deserve it. Thanks. People tend to get what they deserve, Paisley. Um, can we talk... alone for a second? - Hell, no. - Damon. - Hell no. - Let's not hear that. All right, you watch your back. Uh, me too? All right... Call me later. Don't forget. Damon, wait for me... Wait, wait, wait. I was just about to show you... Look at you. Back on top, right where you belong. Things are looking up. Caleb, I miss you. Now, hey, hey, hey, hey... it's too late for that. I'm... I don't even know where to start. You don't have to explain nothing to me, Paisley. I'm sorry that I hurt you. It happens sometimes, right? Look. I've played this moment a thousand times in my head, Caleb. I know I have no right to be here. I just wanted you to know that I loved you. You left me, Paisley. I gave you all I had to give and you still left. You made me look like a fool. I made a mistake. Look, Bobby was my first love. I can't explain what kind of hold that kind of person can put on you. All I can say is I was stupid. I was foolish... I was confused. I'm not confused anymore, Caleb. I love you. And what we had was special. Then you should have stayed, Paisley. You aren't perfect either, Caleb. I never said I was perfect, Paisley. No, you just pushed me away. Pushed you away? The lack of trust, the prenup. This wasn't about no prenup! If you had just signed the thing, I was gonna tear it up. I just needed to know where you heart was. My heart's always been with you, Caleb. It's always been with you. Look, I never asked another man to take me back, but please, just forgive me, okay? I forgive you, Paisley, but you had your chance. I know. And I messed it up. And if I were you, I would say no. Well, good, because that's what I'm saying. But you're not me. You're a good man with a good heart. A heart that loved me once. Paisley, I don't, I don't love you anymore. You do... You do love me. No, no, I don't. Excuse me? Am I interrupting something? Dedra. Paisley, what are you doing here? I was just about to ask you the same thing. - Oh, I'm here... - With me. Dedra, Dedra and I are together now. Dedra? Caleb, I know you hurt you, but you don't have to be with Dedra to spite me. I'm with Dedra because I love her. That's nothing to do with you. I see. I wish you and Bobby the best. Bobby and I are over. No. It ain't over till I say it's over. You're gonna stop walking in my house. I don't believe I'm talking to you. I don't care who you think you talking to. - Get the hell out. - Caleb! How did you find me? Thought I was going to let you get away? After the all time and money I spent building what we have? I said I didn't belong to you anymore, Bobby. I got $500,000 worth of receipts that say you do. Now let's go, Paisley. No... I said no. Paisley, don't make me snatch you faster than the rapid refund... Now let's go. Hey, there ain't gonna be no snatching while I'm here, partner. Is everything cool in here? Yeah. Everything is cool. Bobby was just leaving. You know, I remember when ya'll took that shot. Yeah. That's when it all started. Just Us Records was just a dream. Look at it now. Yeah, yeah. You know, you should be real proud of yourself. - Ya'll did some big things. - Yes, sir. Ooh, good Lord, what is this? Mmm! Baby, you look good. You look better than J-Lo. You look like Way Low. Mmm... Mmm! I'm just kidding, ya'll. - How do I look, boys? - Baby, you look amazing. You look like some frosting on a Cinnabun. Get a room. Good. 'Cause I am gonna tear it up tomorrow on set.' Yes, I am! You're tearing it up now. Tomorrow is Sway's first music video. - Don't mess it up. - Mess it up? Baby, I'm gonna turn it up. I've been practicing... I've got moves. I got eight counts, I got rolls, I got pop, pop, pop and drop. You got the bounce, baby. Don't forget that bounce. Oh, yeah, I got the boom, boom, boom. Boom, boom, boom! Did you take your medication, sweetie? Yes, I did, baby. Thank you for loving me so good. Okay. I told you, when I said I was going to take care of you, I meant it. Listen... All those jobs you've been doing has been preparing you to put in some hard work on me. I can't take it... I can't take it. If Caleb was here, he would put a stop to this mess. Put a stop to what mess? Trina and her little freak show. Hey, hey, hey, get a room. Get a room. The boss is here! Hey, come on, get off me, girl! Hey! So we all set for the video tomorrow? Yeah, is Sway ready is the question. Oh, for sure. Sway! Look, I'm glad everybody is here. We can head over to the engagement dinner. All right, let's go... Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. - The what? - Engagement? What do you mean? Dedra. Ooh. Oh. Step up. I love you... with every ounce of my soul. I thought that I needed a woman to complete me, but you taught me that all I needed was the right woman to compliment me. I don't ever wanna see a day without you. Will you be mine forever? Really? This is for real? This is for real. Yes. Aw, she said yes! I heard her! Can't take it back now! I wanna see this. What ya'll about to do? Ya'll gotta get a room. Ya'll gotta save that for the honeymoon. Yeah! That was kind of cool, though. Ladies and gentlemen, Just Us Records would like to showcase some of our new talent, so please... reset! He's great, he's amazing, he loves women, pizza and hot dogs. He loves shooting movies and... everybody, Miguel Nunez, everybody! Hello and welcome to The Sandra Winslow Show.
