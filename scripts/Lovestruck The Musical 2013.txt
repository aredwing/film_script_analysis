How do you call yourselves dancers? Come here. Julia. Go see if the korean market is still out of aspirin. If so, buy booze.

I did this whirlwind romance, got totally swept away, And look what happened to me. After your father left me- you threw him out. Whatever dad did or didn't do- There wasn't much he didn't do. I'm not gonna let you ruin your life By trading in your dreams For some ridiculous fairy tale in Italy. I want the fairy tale! A role like this only comes around once in a lifetime! A love like this only comes around once in a lifetime. What's that? Hmm. "vitality tonic." Eighty proof. The playboy prince? Is this who you want to give everything up for? He's young, gorgeous, italian, He's the heir to a textile fortune- Women throw themselves at him. And boy, does he catch 'em! Not anymore. He's done playing the field. He's left that all behind. He promised. Promises. What about the promise you made to me To come back after the wedding and be my star? I know. I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna change my mind. You are contractually obligated to perform in the show! You're gonna sue me? For our own good. Mirabella! Mirabella, you cannot walk out on me! You are so banned from my wedding! You wouldn't dare!

Who's this? It's me. Harper? Are you okay? You sound weird. Ahem. Ahem! My throat is a little swollen. I must have caught something on the flight. How's the knee? It's, um... Better. A lot better, actually. That tonic really did the trick. One of the dancers found it here in the theater. Why? I had the tiniest, sort of miniscule, you know... Harper. Reaction. What kind of reaction? Are you sick? I am definitely feeling very strange right now. You should go to the doctor. Amanda, I am fine. I'm fine. I just- I need you to figure out where this stuff came from. I'll see what I can do, but you need to come home right now. We need to find A replacement for mirabella today. Yeah. I came here to convince mirabella That marco is not worth giving up her career for. And now I know how to prove it. What are you going to do? I'm going to seduce marco. You're going to seduce the playboy prince? I'm going to show her that lover boy here isn't cut out to keep promises. Just find out what you can about that tonic And call me back. Excuse me, sir. I'll have you know that I'm an almost-married woman. Oh, that's all right, I'm an almost-married man. And this is how you choose to spend your last few precious hours of freedom? Hours? I only need five minutes. Ew! ( both laughing ) What do we have here? Put that down! No, no! In a marriage there are no secrets. We're not married yet! Not for a couple of days. So we do have secrets! You started your novel? No! Oh, great! Like father, like daughter. No! He's not a novelist. He teaches comparative literature at nyu. Besides, I'm gonna stay in bed with you all day and have six kids. Stop! They're my vows. Sorry. Sorry. Hmm. So... How are yours coming along? Great! I mean, that's really important to you, right? That we both write our own? Yes. It's very important. It's the most important. It's the one chance we have to stand up in front of everybody And say how we really feel about each other, speak from our hearts. And I do love you with all my heart. Me too. I wanna tell you but there's so many words to say I wanna tell you but the words get in my way it's all there on the tip of your tongue my heart's so full, brain goes numb so I'll just ask you, do you? I do me too so I'll just ask you do you? I do me too wish I could tell you that you make me feel like I shine and I'm so proud to be yours and to call you mine it's all there in the beat of my heart just open your mouth and start so I'll just ask you, do you? I do me too so I'll just ask you do you? I do ( knocking on door ) Noelle: Mirabella? Come in! Seating emergency. Total disaster. Come quick. Just a minute. I'm gonna change. Sorry, duty calls. Noelle: I don't know what to do. I don't even know who this person is. Young harper: Am I in the right place? Surprise! And-and you are? You don't remember me? Debbie hayworth. Second cousin once removed. Aunt marjorie's side? Ohh. Okay, Your grandmother and my great-uncle- I'm sorry, too many details. You must be on my mother's list. We played together all the time as kids. Remember the treehouse uncle eddie built in the back of the barn? Of-of course! The old treehouse! God, it's been forever. You look so... So much like my mother when she was young. Really? Yeah, the spitting image. It's weird. It's really weird. Aunt marjorie always said the same thing. And-and I said, "well, if I have to look like somebody, I'm so glad it's aunt harper." I mean, is she just a timeless beauty, or what? And-and so talented. Aunt marjorie always called her "superstar." I really hate to break up the family reunion, But we have a rehearsal dinner nightmare on our hands. See? Oh, gosh, these italian family feuds. They last for 700 years. And I don't know where I'm gonna put my great-aunt birdie. She came in all the way from boston. Interesting color scheme. Is that...Puce? Bold choice. I thought your mom said you were going with Dusky rose and gold accents. No, that's what her mom wanted her to go with. Pink and gold are classics. Old-fashioned. Tasteful. Boring. Oh, my gosh! Debbie, you fixed it! Thank you! Oh! You have got to come to my bachelorette party. Bachelorette party? Oh, yeah, we're family. You have to come. We have champagne and mani-pedi's. Mani-pedi's. Yay! Yay! Well, I'll get settled in, then. Okay. All right. All right. We'll see you for mani-pedi's. All: Mani-pedi's! Amanda! The tonic. What have you got? We have a bigger problem. I spoke to the investors. Amanda, the tonic. Harper, this is serious. You need to come home right now. I can't do this. I am in a situation here, amanda. I need information. What kind of situation? How crazy Is it over there? ( camera snaps ) I'd say it's getting pretty crazy, don't you think? Who's that? She looks familiar. Are you in my office? What? Look around. ( sighs ) Aaaaah! Amanda! Amanda. Amanda? Who is this? It's me, amanda! Now focus! The tonic! No, you're not. That is impossible. You have worked for me for 15 years. We have mounted 22 productions together, and turned Three unknowns into broadway stars. And help me figure out what is in this tonic that turned me young, I will fire you without hesitation or regret! Now pull yourself together! Oh, my god. It is you. Thank you. What have you got? Um... Oh, god. The stuff is really old, harper. It was used for Rheumatism, gout, um... Melancholia, and impotence. What about side effects? Well, I've already looked online. The company's been out of business for decades. Find out: Does it wear off, and if so, can I take more. You got it? Find out. ( exhales ) The things I do for my daughter. Hi. Hello. Debbie hayworth. Marco vitturi. You must be related to mirabella. You look like her. She looks like me. We're second cousins. Once removed. Aunt marjorie's side. Right. Listen to this. "dear mirabella, "you are so beautiful. "I want to never sleep or even blink again "just so I can stare at your beautifulness forever... Until I die." Too over the top? Wow. That is, um... Yeah, that's really bad. It's terrible. But it was mirabella's idea for us to write our own vows for the wedding, And...I don't know, I have no idea what I'm gonna say. Looks to me like you can't stop figuring out what to say. True enough. Love can make you a little crazy sometimes. That's not your reputation, you know. Yeah. I know. Must be really hard to give that up. Not really. Mirabella must be very special to you. Oh, she is. She has this- I mean, she's so- When we first met, I was like- Oh, god. She's-everything. So it's kind of hard, you know, to- She has the most beautiful blue eyes. Yeah. Yeah, she got those from her dad. And this beautiful smile where one side of her mouth kind of turns up- Kind of like yours. Think she's got a secret? Yeah, right. Something, uh...Secret. Oh, and she-she has these beautiful hands. Oh, dancer's hands. You're...A dancer too? Runs in the family. I'm-I'm sorry, have- have we met before? Not in this lifetime. Are you sure? Because- oh, I'm sure. You would definitely remember meeting me. You know, for second cousins, you and mirabella... Yes? It's strange how much you remind me of her. This is so going to work. Noelle, how many times did you lose your virginity? I have no idea, but hey, If the stars align I might lose it again this weekend. ( laughter ) Seriously though, em, you're so lucky to have found a guy like marco. He's so hot and rich... And hot and rich! Hello! Okay, mirabella, it's your turn. Oh, no. Somebody else go. But your story's so good. Okay. She was 16 years old, She told her mom she was spending the weekend at a friend's house- I'm that friend, that influence - and instead, We snuck off to paris! What?! I mean, wow. And there, after staying up all night Walking the banks of the seine hand in hand, Talking until sunrise, Whispering their life stories to each other- Noelle, no! You have got to be kidding me. Our dear, sweet, innocent mirabella Laid herself down with that hot, sexy french man And gave up her precious flower. At sixteen?! It was very romantic. By the end of the night we knew everything about each other And we were like two ships passing. And he was really very sweet. Wait a second. How the heck did you get out of the country without your mother knowing? Her mom was at an out-of-town preview. Her dad gave us permission. We told him it was a class trip. My mom didn't even notice I was gone. Okay, that is not fair. She's a very busy woman. A single mom, a demanding career- Debbie, my mom is, was, and always will be Way too self-centered to think about anybody but herself. She took you to dance classes three times a week when you were a kid. Noelle: What are you doing? The sun is very bad for your skin. So, mirabella, tell me about this french guy. Did you think you were in love with him? Okay, uh, no. I mean, it was a great experience, But it wasn't like how it is with marco. Right. Marco. The playboy prince. I'm sorry. I just- I read that. He retired that title when he met me. Besides, he's not a real prince. ( laughter ) but he is a real italian. I wouldn't worry too much about that, though. Not every italian guy has to have a mistress, right? Right? I'm not worried about it. I knew marco was the right guy right from the very beginning. I made it through the wilderness somehow I made it through didn't know how lost I was until I found you I was beat incomplete I'd been had I was sad and blue but you made me feel yeah, you made me feel shiny and new like a virgin touched for the very first time like a virgin when your heart beats next to mine gonna give you all my love, boy my fear is fading fast been saving it all for you 'cause only love can last you're so fine and you're mine make me strong yeah, you make me bold oh, your love thawed out yeah, your love thawed out what was scared and cold like a virgin touched for the very first time like a virgin when your heart beats next to mine whoa, whoa, whoa-oh whoa-whoa, whoa-oh whoa-whoa-oh like a virgin touched for the very first time like a virgin when your heart beats next to mine like a virgin ( cell phone rings ) Hello? Harper? Any good news, amanda? Okay. Okay, okay. The good news. The trunk that the tonic Was found in was owned by some old vaudeville guy, Tom dorian. Never heard of him. Is that it? And now the not-so-good news. The investors found out about mirabella leaving the show. Oh, no! How?! One of the dancers Spilled, and it gets worse. They're going to recast her. They can't do that. Yes, They can. Look, I told the investors Mirabella'd be back for rehearsal on Monday, But if mirabella is not back here for it, They're going to replace her. And you. We don't need a new lead. Mirabella is coming back. ( laughing ) whoo! And they wouldn't dare replace me. Why am I scared? Don't say anything to anybody. Tell them I will be back on Monday With our star. This wedding is not going to happen. I make it through the wilderness somehow I made it through I didn't know how lost I was until I found you I was beat, incomplete I'd been had, I was sad and blue but you made me feel yeah, you made me feel shiny and new like a virgin touched for... The very first time I- I can't believe you just did that. I can't believe I just did that. I've had too much to drink. Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry! I don't know what came over me! Maybe it was the champagne - no, no, no, you don't understand. I swore I was through with other women, for good. Debbie, mirabella dared me to be a better person, and I thought I could. Because she believed in me more than anyone has In my entire life. But now this? I don't think I can be the man she wants me to be, Or the man she deserves. I'm not good enough for her. Right? I'm sorry, debbie, this isn't your fault. It's mine. I have to go. Oh! This is it. Can you believe I'm getting married tomorrow? No, I really can't. Debbie, what's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. I'm fine, it's just this is the first time I've seen you in your dress. It seems like just yesterday you were a little girl. We. We were little girls. Dancing around the back yard together, Playing with each other's hair... This is the most beautiful you've looked in your entire life. Are you happy? Yes! How could I not be? I'm getting everything that I ever wanted. But you're giving up your dream to be a dancer to stay here with marco. ( laughs ) debbie. Can I... Can I tell you a secret? I never wanted to be a dancer. That was my mom's dream, not mine. What? Never? I mean, maybe for a little while, when I was a kid. I mean, I worshipped my mother. You remember, she was this big glamorous star And everyone loved her. And I wanted to be just like her... For a while. What happened? I grew up. I can't believe you never said anything to your mom. Well... I didn't want to disappoint her. When my mom blew her knee out, She wanted me to be the big star that... She couldn't be anymore. And when I met marco, I finally realized I can't live my life for her, No matter how much I love her. It was like... The first time marco and I met, I could hear this little voice telling me, "this guy's the one." Ya know? Like... The future was talking to me, Telling me I had already spent a whole lifetime with him. Does that sound crazy? No. It's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. Woman: Senorina mirabella? Oh. You know, I forgot to thank you for standing in for noelle today, debbie. I- I have no idea where she could possibly be. Debbie, where are you going? See you at the rehearsal dinner! ( speaks italian ) Scott: Dude, you gotta slow down. I can't keep up. But wait a sec. She said she kissed you? Why are we freaking out about this? Because I didn't stop her- and I should have. I shouldn't have even put myself in a situation where that could have happened. I broke my promise to mirabella. Dude, you only have to feel guilty after the wedding, That's the whole point of getting married. Sage advice from the guy who defines a long-term relationship As a three-day weekend in aspen. I promised her I was done with other women. I don't know, maybe I'm just not cut out for monogamy. (laughing) fantastic! I've got a number of two swedish flight attendants Who can meet us on your boat in three hours! What? I'm not judging you, man. You weren't there. She was like some fairy creature. She put a spell on me. She had these soulful brown eyes, like a gypsy. And she smelled like the perfume my mother used to wear. It was weird. There was something about her, Like...Magical. I have to cancel the wedding. Oh, god, what have I done? I've got to fix this. Name? Ryan hutton. Father of the bride. Is harper hutton here? She is not on the list. About fifty, eyes like a tiger shark. The unmistakable aroma of chanel number 5 and pure evil gives her away. Not on the list, sir. Keep an eye out. She'll never be able to stay away. I got your back. Thanks. ( voices outside ) ...About my age, about this tall? Ryan. Mirabella: Debbie, are you in there? Something's happened. Debbie? (falsetto) I'm here. Can you come out? I need to talk to you. Not feeling well! Why don't you talk to noelle? That's just it, I can't. She and marco kissed last night. Just a sec! Debbie, what's wrong? I thought-you know, didn't we sort of bond? I haven't seen noelle all day. She disappeared. I know it was her. Debbie, are you okay? Not so good! I shouldn't go through with it, right? He kissed another girl. He broke his promise to me. What choice do I have? Oh...Oh... Debbie? I can't go through with it. Right? Oh...Ohh... Oh! Uhh! Uhh! Ohh! Hi, this is amanda. Leave me a message. Amanda, where are you? Call me back. I need to know does this stuff work more than once! Ohh! Mirabella! Dad! I'm so glad you're here! Oh, honey. Is she here? Dad- I'm telling ya, she won't be able to resist. Honey, what's wrong? Dad, I think mom might have been right about marco the whole time. Your mother hasn't been right about anything since 1987 When she said, "let's name her mirabella." noelle: Look who it is. Hi, noelle. What's wrong with her? I don't know. Pre-wedding jitters, I guess. Have you talked to her? Harper: Oh! What's that? Sounds like an elephant passing a kidney stone. Has to be debbie. Who's debbie? Mirabella's cousin, debbie hayworth? Never heard of her. Ooh. Too many tequila shooters. Debbie, are you all right? Mm-hmm. Okay, well, then you need to suck it up, Because I have got a hangover that could bring down a t-rex. After the dance-off is all a blur. And where is mirabella? so I guess it's over there's nothing left to say take the ring off my finger and just call it a day thought we had forever but that was yesterday you're such a liar wish I saw it on your face but you did it so well can somebody just tell me how how can I remember to forget when my heart just won't let me make myself unlove you tell me that it's not true I know all the reasons I just can't believe them and pretend we never met how can I remember to forget? wish that I could hate you so I could let you go wish I never met the one I want the most I could fill an ocean with all the tears I've cried tell me you were joking just a dream I had last night but I'm wide awake and I want you so much right now how can I remember to forget these emotions and all the plans we made like we'd never happened, make my heart unbreak I know it's really over but I just don't know how how can I remember to forget when my heart just won't let me make myself unlove you tell that it's not true I don't want to leave you I just can't believe, no and pretend we never met how can I remember to forget? forget oh ooh ( sniffing ) Hmm. Chanel number five. Harper? Harper. Oh, my- This is not going to end well. ( door opens ) What are you doing? Why aren't you getting dressed for the rehearsal dinner? I'm leaving. Marco and noelle kissed last night, remember? Moonlight magic. Gag. My mom was right about him, debbie. He's never gonna change. Have you... Talked to him yet? No. I know that I have to- don't. Don't! This could all just be normal jitters. Cold feet. It's not just about a kiss, debbie. Marco can't- He can't express his feelings for me. Every single time it comes up, he clams up. I just- I think that I made a big mistake. I don't think that he's ready for marriage. That is not true. It's not true. Marco loves you. Look, I know how you're feeling. My ex cheated on me. And I bet that you dumped him. Oh, I did. But... I didn't dump him because he cheated, I dumped him because he cheated and lied to me about it. I gave him a chance to come clean, But by then it was too late. That's terrible, debbie. I'm sorry. Listen, I speak from experience. If marco tells you the truth about what happened, You will know that it was just a stupid mistake And he is so sorry. Can you handle that? I don't know. We have this huge dance in front of everyone At midnight after the rehearsal dinner. It's a vitturi family tradition. Okay. Give him until midnight, then. Can you do that? Okay, until midnight. Good. How'd you get so smart about this stuff? Because I have an old soul. It's gonna be okay, pumpkin. "pumpkin"? My mom calls me that. Does she? That's so funny. My mom calls me that too. All right, well, I gotta go. But debbie, what if he doesn't- Doesn't tell the truth? Mr. Hutton. I'm so glad you're here. Marco. Oh, I'm sorry I missed your bachelor party. I hope you behaved yourself. Well, actually, I messed up. I got drunk, and I don't know how it all happened, But it ended up with me kissing someone who is not mirabella. But it didn't mean anything, and the other girl kind of kissed me, really. But I made this promise to mirabella that I was through with all that. And now I don't know what to do. Sit down. I want you to look me in the eye and tell me the truth- Do you love my daughter? Absolutely. With all my heart, sir. All right, then. I can help you fix this, But you have to do exactly what I say. I know I have to tell her the truth. No. Don't tell her the truth. You'll only end up hurting her, and I don't want that to happen. Believe it or not, I was once in your shoes- And now look at me. You're divorced. Exactly. Because I told the truth! You know, your divorce is why mirabella is so worried about me. It was really hard on her. I know it was. Telling mirabella the truth won't change anything. I don't want to lie to her. If you love her, you hato lie. You can't tell her the truth, no matter what. Clear? All right. Hey, where ya goin'? To talk to a ghost. Oh! Where did that boy go? Harper. It is you! It is not! What the hell's going on here? How can-how can you look like this? I'm sure I don't know you, so if you'll just excuse me- Harper, your ass. What? I recognized it in the bathroom. I know that ass. I fell in love with that ass. God help me, I spent the better part of the eighties worshipping that ass. Really? It is you. Hello, ryan. It's been a while. I need a drink. I'll get it for you. Come. I also need a priest. Gotta be a priest around here somewhere, this is Italy. Where are all the priests? Oh, my god. Will you stop being so dramatic? I have a perfectly reasonable explanation. There is nothing reasonable about this - or you. Okay, just take a deep breath- Don't- don't tell me what to do. Where are you going? To find a cop. This can't be legal. ( coughing ) W- what happened? You're going to be very angry. Distinct possibility, if you're involved in any way. My knee was the size of a grapefruit, ryan, And-and there was this tonic, and it is magical. And I took a sip and I turned young. Amanda found it in the back of the theater- Lord knows how long that's been there - but I had no choice. So in a way, it's kind of like fate. And I hated marco, I hated him, But it turns out he really loves her, and she really loves him back, And okay, I admit, I originally came here to stop the wedding-at first. But theyou know, as it turns out, I, um, I kissed him... Of course. And now it's all gone terribly wrong somehow. Well, then, you haven't lost your touch. This isn't a joke, ryan. Seriously, harper, how could you do something like this to our daughter? I know, I know, it's terrible. Are you mad? Hold on. Did you drug me? Of coursi drugged you. You were gonna drop the dime on me. Plus, I really need your help with this. You...Drugged me! I was thinking about our daughter! Oh, sure you were! Wha- Aaaah! Right. Ryan? Ryan! Hmm... Ryan. Ryan. Huhh! What did you do to me this time? Whose voice is that? Is that-(coughs)- (shrill) hey, that's me! (deeper) hey, that's me. Why do I sound so weird, harper?! Oh, my god. Harper, this... Is a miracle. I know, I know, you're young, I've been there, I've done that. Listen to me. Yeah! I have ruined our daughter's one chance at love. So I need you to help me fix it. Yeah, well, you can check that off your to-do list, Because I already fixed it. What do you mean? Marco spilled the whole can of beans. I told him no witness, no crime. Just deny till he dies. It's all good. No. Ryan! No- Ryan! Mirabella overhead marco talking about the kiss. He hato confess. Uh-oh. Yeah. I told her that if he tells her the truth, That means he loves her and she can trust him. So if he doesn't tell her, she'll just think he's trying to cover it up And that means he'll cheat on her again. We have to fix this. Wow. To see your mind at work is at once fascinating and repugnant. Oh, my god. You are completely useless. I remember why I divorced you. It was not a divorce- It was an exorcism! You cheated on me! One time! Mid-life crisis. And then you lied about it. And when I told the truth, you kicked me out! We do not have time for this. Where could marco be? Think, ryan. Think? I can't think because I'm 30 years younger than I was 20 minutes ago! I can't believe you got me into this! Wait- yes, I can. Okay, look, I just read this guy's diary on the plane, Oh my god, I hope I'm not too late. Look, whatever happens, do not take a third dose. ( disconnects ) Mirabella. Wow. You look... What's wrong? Nothing. What's wrong with you? Nothing. So we're both good. We're great. Look... I don't want any secrets between us. That's not the way to start a marriage. I totally agree. So...You would tell me the truth about anything stupid You might have done in the past? Distant, recent, whatever? Well, um, mirabella, What I'm trying to say is that, well, I... Wait! He's gonna tell her. Um... Of course I would. If I had something, you know, to confess. ( grunts ) Damn. Mirabella... Young harper: I've seriously messed this up. And how. Okay, what's our plan? Ha! "our" plan? Would you stop, please, look what I can do! How long does thohh! Ow! Last? And help me? We only have until midnight when the rehearsal dinner ends. I can't help it. This stuff really works. Of course it works. It's-(gasps )- Oh, my gosh, the tonic! I left it at the bar! Hmm. No! No, no! Where is it? I don't see it. ( gasps ) what? Oh. What happened? Oh, aunt birdie. She must have chugged the whole bottle. What's that gonna do to her? I don't want to know. Aunt birdie? ( gasps ) Oh, my god. What? There goes great-aunt birdie. Proud matriarch of the hayworth line. Wow. She's got some moves. Runs in the family. You have really screwed this up. ( music, chatter ) ( whispering ) Hey. I am debbie, and you are...? Angus. Angus? Angus. Okay, we only have until midnight to get this fixed, angus. Hey. I know it goes completely against your nature And ever fiber of your being is screaming at you to do the opposite, But you have to tell the truth. Let marco off the hook for this kiss, harper. Tell him you kissed him. He's gotta understand none of this was his fault. It's the only way to fix this mess. You're right. Ugh! God, I hate it when that happens. Noelle: No, I'm serious. You look amazing. Oh, the bride-to-be is here. Mirabella. Hey. Mirabella: Hi. Thanks for ruining my life. I thought we were best friends. Excuse me? Back up a sec. You can drop the act, Because I know that you and marco kissed last night. What are you talking about? I heard him and scott talking about it under the bridge. "soulful brown eyes, full of life, embracing the moment." Mirabella, I was really drunk last night, but I wasn't that drunk. "mirabella, you're so lucky! He's so hot and rich, and hot and rich!" Okay, fine! I was plastered. After I left you guys, I- I hit up the bachelor party... And I can't remember much after that. Convenient. We've been best friends since seventh grade. I would never hurt you. Besides, I'm not the only one around here with brown eyes. The jig is up! No, no, no! She can't find out it was me! What do we do? We have to convince her That there's no way debbie would have kissed marco. Okay, how do we do that? Hey! Hey, hey- hey, wait. We lay it on thick. Come on. No. No. so we back in the club with our bodies rockin' from side to side side, side to side thank god the week is done I feel like a zombie gone back to life back, back to life hands up yeah, suddenly we all got our hands up no control of my body ain't I seen you before?

( cheers, applause ) Bravo! Bravo! Amazing! ( line out ringing ) ( phone ringing ) ( line out ringing ) No, don't - hello? Dad, where have you been? I've been looking for you everywhere. Hey, honey. What's up? Where are you? Who that guy? And how did I miss him? Uh... Upstairs. Uh, I'm... Jet lagged. You sound weird. Are you okay? I do feel very strange right now. I'm not myself at all. I'm gonna go find marco. Dad... What is it, honey? I'm so confused. I don't think I can go through With this wedding. It's just that mom said mthat he would never mbe faithful to me. And then debbie said the way I could find if he would be Is if he confessed to kissing noelle last night, Because that would mean that he's sorry, and he didn't. And I think that it speaks to a larger character flaw, And on top if it all, he can't even tell me how he feels about me. Honey, listen. People are human. They make mistakes. I made a lot of mistakes with your mom. And she definitely punished me for it. But I never stopped loving her Through any of it. Even asset seizure? All the lawyers In the world weren't able to change the way I feel about her. So then why did you cheat on her? ( sighs ) because I was selfish... And lonely and...Insecure. Your mom was a real star, honey. When she blew out her knee, I wasn't sad. I was thrilled. I thought, finally I don't have to share her with the rest of the world. But that didn't happen. She went right back to work And became the star choreographer, the one everyone Wanted to work with, everyone adored. And there I was, still nobody, Holding her coat at parties. Dad, I had no idea. What I did to her was the biggest mistake of my life. I think I must have always hoped for a second chance. But I never thought I'd get it. I never felt I deserved it. After you cheated on mom, she couldn't trust you anymore. And now I know why. And I can't trust marco. No- He loves you, honey. Really? Where's the proof? He can't even talk to me anymore. I can't go through with this wedding. I'm going home. Mirabella- Damn. ( dance music ) Oh, no! Not now! Hello? Mrs. Hutton? What are you doing here? I know I'm not supposed to be here. If you came to stop the wedding, you're too late. The wedding's not happening. I know. I spoke to debbie. She told me everything. What? W-why? We're very close. You were right about me all along. I broke my promise to her, and then I lied about it. When mirabella finds out- Marco, shut up. I flew all the way here to tell you. I know debbie. I've known her all her life. She's a rare and beautiful creature- Incomparable, actually, one of a kind. But she has a problem letting go. She loves mirabella. They used to be very close... When they were younger. Really? Debbie pushed herself on you. She wanted to prove that you weren't good enough. But why would she do that? She doesn't even know me. She... Had her heart broken a long time ago. She loved a man more than she wanted to, And it made her feel out of control, and... And he cheated on her. I don't know, I guess she just stopped believing in love after that. And when mirabella met you... The playboy prince? It was like deja vu. Debbie expected the worst from you, And when the worst didn't happen on its own, she made it happen. She made a terrible mistake, and she is so sorry, marco. I know I never approved of you, But I was wrong - I should have given you a chance. You're a good man. Don't give up on mirabella. I think she might have given up on me. Go. Look for her. Tell her how much you love her. I don't think she'll believe me. Prove it to her. Find a way. I'll try. Oh, ryan, look at you. The tonic didn't last very long, did it? Probably from trying to keep up with you on the dance floor Like back in the day. I knew I still had it in me. (groans) now I have proof. Oh, my gosh. Proof! Wha- What? What are we doing? We're looking for a book. A big book. What's in the book? Marco's wedding vows. We have to find it- ( men speaking italian ) What the hell are you doing? I'm trying to hide you. Ryan, they're on marco's side. They don't even know me. Oh. I didn't think of that. I'm sorry. Apology accepted. Actually, you're still a pretty good kisser. You're not bad yourself. It's locked! Why is it locked?! How important is it to get into this greenhouse? The future happiness of our daughter may depend on it. All right. Get out of the way. Ohh! Oh... That was a bad idea. Are you all right? Ahhh. Yeah. Yeah. Oh... I'm so sorry, harper. For what? I don't know. For all of it. Everything I didn't do, everything I did. Well, it was a long time ago. Not so long. Ever since we split up I feel like I've been living someone else's life. I love you, harper. I miss you. I want to come home. I love you too, you idiot. ( laughs ) I always have. Now let's finish this- for mirabella. ( sighs ) which ones are the vows? I think all of them. Grab as many as you can. And do what? We have to find mirabella. You have to show these to her So you can prove that marco really loves her. You think that's gonna work? It has to. Come on. Right behind you. Where are you going? Where does it look like I'm going? Wait. I- I have to tell you- What?! Go ahead, marco, tell me how you really feel about me. You're-you look-um... Well, um...Um- Wait. Give me a second. I'm sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me. Whenever I'm around you lately, I can't speak. I know. All right? About the kiss. So there's nothing left to say. But there is. I love you so much. I know what I did was wrong. I should have never let it happen. So then why did you? I don't know. But all I can think about since it happened is how much I hurt you. Oh- this way. Come on. Marco:...So beautiful... This is crazy. I can-I want to never... Do you hear that? What? Just talk to me. Tell me right now in your own words why you want to marry me. It's them. Wait! What is this? Here, take some. "to mirabella on our wedding day." Are these... Your vows? ( both laughing ) I want to tell you but there's so many words to say I want to tell you but the words get in my way it's all there on the tip of your tongue my heart's so full, brain goes numb so I'll just ask you, do you? I do me too so I'll just ask you do you? I do me too I promise I will be there as the years go by and I'll be faithful to you till the day I die just to have and to hold your hand makes me the luckiest man so now I ask you, do you? I do me too so now I ask you, do you? I do so many pieces of paper Both: crumpled up and thrown away so many "I'll do it later's" I gotta the nerve gotta get the nerve why such crazy behavior? gonna say my vows today I can't wait oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh do you? I do me too oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh do you? I do me too Oh.Did it! You are still one amazing woman. Still? Always. Oh, harper, thanks god! Amanda! I have been driving around these back roads for hours. This place is impossible to find. What are you doing- Move away from that bottle. Why? What- Harper, the third dose is permanent. Permanent? Yes, as in "forever." And that's a bad thing because...? ( sighs ) What? I mean, we're talking about immortality here. This is an unimaginable gift- to be young forever? You can't just throw this away without even considering it. No, no, no. It's not a gift, it's a curse. There's only one dose left here. You were going to be the biggest star broadway had ever seen. The stage, the fans, the spotlight... And it all would have happened for you, except... My knee. You can have that all back now. You can be the new star of your show. I could, couldn't I? And you really want that for me? I just want to make you happy, harper. That's all I've ever wanted from the first day we met. I've just never been very good at it. So...Yes. If this is what makes you happy, this is what I want. No, no, no, no. Don't be crazy, harper. You will lose everything. Can you really say goodbye to mirabella forever? Never see your grandkids? Come on. You can't give all that up. It's your choice, harper. You were the most handsome man I'd ever seen. Noelle: Girl, I cannot believe but you look so hot! Married. Thank you. Mom. What are you doing here? Hi, mrs. Hutton. I'm gonna leave you two to talk. I know. I'm banned. But I've had time to think about it. I've just been so wrong about everything. I was- I was wrong about marco. So wrong. He's a wonderful guy. And he loves you, and love is what really matters. I mean, everything else fades away, but love lasts. And I'm so proud of you for knowing that... And following your heart. You still mad at me? Can I come to your wedding? I couldn't do it without you. Oh! Oh, I love you so much, pumpkin. I love you more than you'll ever know. How did I ever get such a smart girl? (laughs) I don't know. I guess I had a good teacher. Wait. What about the show? ( laughs ) Today is about celebrating your dreams, not mine. Today my daughter is getting married! Ha! Who are you and what have you done with my mother? Oh...It's just a brand-new me. Oh. You have got to see cousin debbie. She reminds me so much of you. Really? Then she must be quite a girl. Come on.
