Did you tell her to bring me a skateboard? - You already have one. - I want another. Tomi, that's enough. - Look, Tomi, she's on that plane. - Yes, there. Not yet... - She isn't coming. - She will. Elena. Hello. - You look just the same. - No. - You look the same. - No. How are you, Sebas? Toms, a handsome boy. Did you bring a skateboard? - Tomi! - What! Mom said you'd brought Dad's stuff. Did you know he was writing a novel? - Really? - I'd love to read it. We could look for it later. Yes. Watch out, Tomi. Do you like it? Well, we're just moving in. There's a lot to be done. It's so big! And all that light. Come on. I'll show you around. This is the guest room. When the painters finish, you can give it a try. Ok. I can't believe you're here. Ten days. Can't you stay any longer? No, I can't. I'll come more often now you're here. Will you? - You're sharing with Tomi. - That's fine. Excuse me. Your aunt. Can I sleep on the top? Only joking. - Do you want to rest? - Ok. Help me set the table, Tomi? Oh no, God. Thanks, Auntie. Can I wear it? - There it is. - Can you? - It suits you. - It's beautiful. Keep it, I want you to have it. No, no, no... Are you crazy? I don't usually wear dresses like this. I don't go to parties, or to the embassy. My life isn't glamorous. - Are you kidding me? - No. The moths will get at it. Sarita Levin just came out of you. Don't ever say that again to me. How could you think of Aunt Sarita? Moths, mothballs. That's true. How beautiful! Did you see that picture with Tomi? - Remember that day? - Of course. Student's Day. No. My birthday. We spent the weekend on the island. Wasn't that the day Sebas caught a huge dorado and some dogs ate it? No, Sebastin wasn't there. It was me who caught it. - Remember? - Not really. This is Sebastin. No. He wasn't there. - And who took the picture? - Martn. I'm wrinkling your dress. Got any more photos of that day? I don't know. There must be... Let's look at old pictures. I haven't opened the boxes since we moved. - Give it to me. Let me. - No. That's it. Yes? Hold on, it's all twisted. Let me see. Careful. There. I feel weird going through it. I'd forgotten Dad's curved Js. It was buried in the garden. Just before he died, Daddy told Mom. Later she asked me to bring it. I guess she thought it would be safer here. Elena, here it is. The novel. IN THE SHADE OF A PARADISE BY DAVID LEVIN Hi! Mommy how are you? Yes, I knew it was you. She arrived perfect. Beautiful and full of presents. Yes. Happy. Imagine... Ok. Ok... yes. I promise we'll spend Christmas together in Argentina. Love you. Bye, mom. Bye. I pick up the other phone. How was the trip? Hello, Mom. As usual, I wanted to get off as soon as we took off. Nati, there's a tribute to your father at University in October with the re-edition of "Shelter," You must come, Please, - I can't speak in public, - I can't make it. They finally publish Dad and you can't make it? I have to work, I'll be in Nicaragua in October. Couldn't you choose a more dangerous place? Mother, I'm not a travel agent, I'm a journalist. So cover the return of democracy in Argentina, Guess who I saw the other day, Ceci, She asked about you, She came back from France with two beautiful sons, - People are coming back, - We've been over this. I'm not coming back. Natalia, - Elena are you there? - Yes, Mom. I'm here. Thanks for the Newell's jersey. Tomi never takes it off. I got your transfer, I'll pay you back when I get the pension, Sebastin's earning good so as long as we can help you, I'm glad. Thank you, darling, Let's hang up now. I'll call you Sunday. Love to Sebastin and Tomasito, Love you. - Can you put Nati on again? - Of course. I'm here. Martn's mother, Clara, came yesterday, You know she's with the Mothers, They want you as a witness for the Conadep, Ok, Mom. I'll think about it. Love you. Bye. What's that? Souvenir. Punk years. I was a waitress in the Gothic, a neighborhood. Did it hurt? Can't remember. I was high most of the year. Nati... Mom's lonely, she wants to see you. I offered her a ticket to Spain... But she wants you to go there. It's not that easy. ARGENTINA, 9 YEARS EARLIER - Hello, Nati. - Hello. Here. No, how's Dad? - Is he at his desk? - Yes. He's writing. It's an honor to be laid off by those fascists. Maybe I can talk to Sebastin's uncle. - Maybe they need a professor... - Dad at a priest's school? He could teach literature and make a living. It's good. It's direct and poignant. You should lighten it a little. Martn, don't be so erratic... - But you've got talent. - Thanks. Now we have to see if you have discipline. Writing takes more sweating than soccer. Would you sign this? Yes, of course. - I've read it 3 times. - Dad. I'm here baby. Excuse me, you have a call. Ok, I'm coming. Martn Garca, my student, my daughter, Natalia. Didn't you write the essay on Cortzar? Yes. Dad gave it to me. I loved it. Well, thank you. Martn wants to be a writer. And Natalia's a very sharp reader. I criticized some of his adjectives... Don't fool yourself. She looks sweet, but she doesn't forgive. - Bye, thanks. - Thank you. Did you know Rimbaud was 20 when he wrote it? Isn't it amazing? It's intimidating. Oh, sorry. You're still in bed. Good morning. I'm reading Dad's novel. "In the bed of the siesta they made their plan to join the combatants. Marcelo Segu received the order with enthusiasm. At the age of 19 his idealism and arrogance prevented him from smelling betrayal. " This character resembles Martn. There's a girl who reminds me of you. - Really? - Here. "Teresa read the note, straightening her hair, calming her anxiety. " Just like you. Listen. "Teresa bursts into tears, she then falls into a deep sleep. Soon she'll discover she's pregnant. She'll become more sensitive, more solemn, more beautiful. " What does my pregnancy have to do with it? - You never told me about Paco. - Paco? It ended on Christmas Day. - No kidding. - Yes. - I sent him home, ribbons and all. - No! I swear, no more journalists, especially married ones. A mess. The journalist is just a detail. You always go for the most difficult ones, as Sebastin says. - He says that? - Yes. No, don't take it wrong. You know what I mean. It seems you do everything to remain lonely. Maybe it's your way of life, always travelling... But Martn wasn't a hard one. I wasn't talking about Martn. I was. I don't understand how they knew where he was hiding. - You know he's writing about this? - No. Maybe he knew something else. Come on, we have to return the bikes. Listen. "When her mother got sick, Teresa did all the cooking, helped her sister with her homework... She took care of everything with devout generosity. " Teresa is definitely you. Does it say I almost poisoned the family thinking that Odex was flour? Let's see... No. We have no poisoning. Dad was very generous to forget that. And I didn't play teacher out of selflessness. It was to bother you. Thank you. - Why? - The monthly check. It was Dad's money. No, after I left, he signed two checks. But you never accepted yours. You wired it to me. How did you know about it? Mom told me when she was in Spain, after Dad died. Thanks to you - I was able to finish University. - You needed it more than me, and it was my excuse to quit medicine, I was fed up with it. Whatever, I owe you a lot. Plus interest. I don't know... at least an apartment in Paris. When I sent you the ticket to Europe you stood me up. I wanted that trip with you so much. Yes, I know. And I'd have loved it but I never found the time and Tomi got chicken pox. And then this thing... You never find the time, do you? I'd cancel the debt anytime. The invitation still stands. You pay the Old People's Home and we're even. Dad. Thanks, kid. Don't worry, it's just the smoke. When they fired me from the paper and things started to get rough, we decided it would be safer for you to come and live here. I didn't want to leave the country. Now I think it wasn't fair on you. You could have studied in Buenos Aires. I like it here. But there's no future here. - Where would you study medicine? - I don't want to be a doctor now. Physical education's no career. I love it. Besides, I'm doing better than I expected. Really. Always so self-controlled. Never a complaint. But, a gym teacher? Professor of physical education, professor. I love working at the gym, really. - It's good. - I don't think it's bad, until you can enroll for university. And if I don't want to? And I choose to marry Sebastin and have children and be a housewife? - Don't even think about it. - Why? A baby would leave you with no options. I'm not looking for options. I don't know, I'm lucky to have what I love right here. Don't worry. Mom and I will arrange for you to go to Buenos Aires next year. - You're not listening. - What? Nothing. They always fitted you better and you always got the pink, remember? Of course. How could I forget? To Natalia... This week she saved us from diet food, small salad, yogurt, cottage cheese... Come on, it's not that bad. - To Aunt. - Cheers. - Cheers! - Cheers! It's a bit spicy, isn't it? No, it's delicious. - It isn't burnt? - Don't be obsessive. Obese? That means fat. Obsessive... That means perfectionist. Mom's a perfectionist. A pain in the ass. - What? - Nothing. Look what your aunt gave me. It's from a tribe. A tribe? Yes, the Zulus. From South Africa. - It's the symbol of struggle. - Are they warriors? No, but they're fighting right now. Did you go to fight with them? No, I didn't go to fight with them. I went to work for TV. Daddy, is it true she works for TV? Yes, and sometimes for newsreels. And were they communists? My granddad was. But don't tell anybody. No, well... It's not like that. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Yes. Nobody said that, Tomi. I went with Grandma to Cuba and I can't tell anybody here. It's no secret. But nobody will understand. What's to understand about a 7-year-old going to Cuba for the summer? Fine, and now I protect him. From what? You're making him - deny who he is. - Wake up, Natalia. You're in the United States, 1984, and the reds are on the way out. - Time's taught nothing. - We finally agree. You sound like kids. Anyway, Havana was old and ugly. I can't say a word without her attacking me. Come on, stop playing the martyr. Tomi, go to bed. Mom, it's almost over. I don't know, be careful. Do I need to tell you that she suffered a lot? That she was young. - She asks for it. - Just let it go, just one time. I am not an ogre and she is no little lamb. Who made Molotov cocktails in the yard? Watch what you say. Leave my family alone. And me? What am I? We are your family, Elena. 10 years without seeing each other... And suddenly she's your only family. Tomi, go to bed. Go to bed. Mom, what's a Molotov cocktail? - What? - A Molotov cocktail. It's a drink, a Russian drink. You should knock before you come in. Sorry. How come you're still awake? Exams. And also a story to hand in tomorrow. - Where will it be published? - In "La Opinin. " Well, not me. It's an unpublished Russian author from last century... Lia Divnev. Too fake? You're always playing with letters. That's my job. Do you need help? - Aren't you tired? - I can type. Thanks. You're the only one who can read my scrawl. Let's see. Serrano... 3. Ruiz... 6. Garca Sols... Four point five. No... Nine point five. So, what do you think? I love it. The end is sad but simple and perfect. Crab writing, from end to beginning. I can't write till I know what the end is. I can make notes but I only begin to write when I'm sure about the end. Then I write backwards, searching the origin of the story. It seems so natural, and what you say is so premeditated. I think it was Berger who said that a story only becomes a story once you know the end. The end gives it sense. Writing is associated with death by definition. Dad, you need fresh air. - We'll go fishing this Sunday. - All right. Ok. Good night. Sleep well. - What? - Did dad leave this? Yes. Why? The end's missing. - Maybe he didn't finish it. - Impossible. He did write the end. It must be somewhere. Get dressed. Let's go and pick Tomi up. I can't get a word right. Fuck. Don't worry, Thomas "estar bueno. " You said "fuck" in front of the teacher. Stay away! Sorry, please. I swear I'll learn English. Thomas! - "Estar bueno!" - "Estar muy bueno!" My uncle Luis gave me this plane. He knows everything about planes. He took me and Grandma Lucy for a helicopter ride for my birthday. It was great. Do you know Grandma Lucy? Yes, of course. Do you miss your Grandmas? Yes, and I miss my uncle too. He's a Newell's fan like me. He takes me to the stadium. Want any more? Good barbecue for a writer. - Well... - It's very good. Let me see... - Rodolfo Walsh, very good. - I devoured it. He is so passionate and poignant in his writing. - You worked with him, right? - A few months in the newspaper. He was a warm guy, very funny and brilliant. - Who? - Walsh. And you? Elena told me you're training - for the national team. - Yes. Good. Soccer now. Excuse me but I am lost there. There are a few books... Come with me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Open up, Martn! Take him out, he's a zombie. This boy only plays well when he wants. Play soccer, Martn. You're standing there. - It was a foul, Sebastin. - You see? He's the same in school. No respect for authority. Does what he wants, and my nephew lets him. Luis Morini, Sebastin's uncle and Head at San Jose School. My sister. Natalia, Martn Garca Sols' girlfriend. And I'm a genius at public relations. She's not very diplomatic either. - Congratulations! - Why? I hear you're top of your class. Your father must be proud. Yes... I haven't told him yet. Do these names sound familiar? Peralta, Ordez, Stein... None of them, Why? I'm sure they're based on real people. I'll find out, They've found a tutor at San Jose, a collaborator with the military, They're making inquires, What do you know about Sebastin's uncle? Morini, An asshole, Flirts with Peronists, wants to be a deputy, A reactionary, What was that? Clarita Garca Sols using the word "reactionary"? Darling, lots of water went under the bridge, - Nothing about Morini? - No, nothing, It's hard, Nobody - wants to talk about it, - I know. You must testify, Not just for Martn, - Try to be here before the 5th, - Ok, Clara. I'll see. Bye. Hello, kid. Hello, old man. I've come to play soccer with the kids. I heard there's a field around here. Anybody know the way? - Me! - You? Ok, let's go. Go! Comrades, comrades. The University Youth Movement expresses its solidarity with the meat workers, who were fired for being honest and fighting leaders, opposed to union bureaucracy, - the mafias... - We're not here to use people. This is the only way. No charity but politics. I don't want to be part of this. Let's go, Martn. And build a better society, with equality and solidarity. It's the Youth Team! You'd only miss a week of class. - I can talk to my uncle... - I can't. - Why can't you go? - Because I must stay here. What could you possibly miss in this dump? I said I'd go with the Youth. - They're a bunch of lazy charlatans. - No, it's not like that. You won't catch anything, if you don't shut up. I'm hungry. Anybody want - a sandwich? - Me. This is the one chance in your life. Factories are taken over all the time. Go to the next one. I've given my word. Ok, Superman, but with or without you, they're screwed. The thugs'll come from Buenos Aires and fix things with the bosses. Spoken like a reactionary. I am not a reactionary, I'm realistic. - You're naive. Normal at your age. - Your realism is comfortable and bourgeois, did you know? You sound like a montonera, Has she had a rabies shot? - Sit, Monto, sit. - Where did you find this gorilla? Cut it out. Hurry. Hurry. Go, go, go. Thank you, comrade. It was when we lived in Urquiza. My mom had a store. - Here. - Thanks. - I spoke to Martn's mother. - Yes? - How did you meet him? - Soccer. Martn was 15 years old. I was starting as a coach at San Jose. Was your uncle Morini the Head? Yes, of course. What did he say about you and Martn? - He hated it. - Nati, when Martn got mixed up in politics my uncle was not thrilled. Yes, he wanted him expelled. You opposed. Martn told me. I didn't want to lose my best forward. And then when they painted "Morini fascist pig" on the door of the San Jose, you said Martn had been with you all night. My contribution to the revolution. And your uncle's contribution to the coup d'etat? Look Nati, my uncle is a bit fascist, but no rat. He didn't share your dad's ideas but he got him out, didn't he? That's what they say. Anyway, he couldn't know where Martn was. Who else knew he was in Los Parasos? I don't know. I didn't know. Martn and I avoided talking about politics. I went on a soccer tour. Martn was like a brother to me. I came as soon as I heard. Clara and I searched all the police stations, your dad the hospitals. This is where the party is. - Can I go to the party? - No, it's for grownups. You stay with your aunt and watch a movie. Did you know Tomi makes the best "poror"? - Popcorn. - Popcorn. If you teach me, I'll teach you to take pictures. - Dad? - Come on, Tomi, you're a big boy. Here. We'll be back before 12. Take care of the watch and of your aunt, she's our special guest. - Bye, my love. - Bye. Here, Nati. This is the number. Call if you need to. Ok, have fun. Thank you. Bye. No. I don't want to dance. Ok. There's one that goes like this... Can you make popcorn for me? Auntie, I found the tape! Natalia! It's burning! Natalia! Come! - Get away! - Hurry, Natalia! Get out! Look what you've done. You almost burned my house down. I want you to leave. - I want my mom and dad. - It was an accident. No, it wasn't an accident. I knew you were a terrorist. What? And I knew you were a montera, - Montonera? - Yes, go away. I wanted to caress you when you were in your mom's belly. I asked her to name you Toms. Did you know that? No, of course you didn't. And you don't know how many times I wanted to visit for your birthday and couldn't. So I sent the walkie-talkies, the Batman costume... - They don't have batteries. - What? The walkie-talkies. We'll buy some tomorrow. Now go to bed. Your mom will worry if she finds you sleeping there. Turn around. Why did you never come and visit? The military was in Argentina and I couldn't go back. That's why I didn't come for your birthdays, or Christmas, or when my dad got sick. Not even when he died. You can turn around now. And why don't you go and visit Grandma Marta? The military are gone. I'm scared. Scared of what? Give me your gun. Put those down or I'll shoot her. On the ground, slowly. I won't forget your face, you son of a bitch! What have you done to your hair? It was beautiful. - Do you want some tea? - No. I'm pregnant. Sebastin doesn't know yet. No-one knows but you. No! Help me! Help me! Help me! Tell my family... 85509, tell them! Tell them! No! No! - Luis. - Elena. - Where's Sebastin? - He's not here. - What is it? - I was coming from the supermarket. They beat and arrested a pregnant girl. Calm down. I'm one month pregnant. Are you sure? That's great, baby! How did it go? Fine, he just fell asleep. - Good night. - Good night. Have a good time? Today Sebastin told me Dad was searching the hospitals when they took Martn. If he'd talked, he wouldn't have gone. - Dad was no hypocrite. - No, of course not. How could you suspect him? I don't know. They could have tortured him. That morning they came for me, they didn't find me and took him. He was out in the afternoon and on the same night they found Martn - in Los Parasos. - Dad didn't talk, Nati. Morini knew the Chief and that's how he got out. Besides, how could Dad know where Martn was hiding? I don't know. Fuck. The doubt has been with me for ages. Enough! Leave Dad in peace. - Do you remember? - No. Ever go back to Los Parasos? No. Nobody ever went back. I'll miss you so much. I may be back sooner than you expect. What are you saying? You're playing great. I'm sure they'll want you and you won't come back. What is it? My stomach's upset. Want some tea? No... Yes. No, wait. Are you okay? Who do you think you are? Joan of Arc? Are you stupid? The world talking about the coup and you do this? Take them away or I'll tell them. - You won't tell them anything. - Yes, I will. No, you won't. If you do, I'll tell them their perfect daughter has been sucking her boyfriend's thing in their bed. Got it? Shut up, perfect, pregnant. You don't get it. - What happened? - They came this morning. For your sister. She wasn't there so they took your dad. I called Larguia's son, he's a lawyer. I also called Morini. He's here. Maybe he can do something. Would you go home and pick up his medicine? - Yes. - Tell your sister to go to Chiche's. They won't look for her there. - I'll get your father out. - Ok, thank you. - But... - You stay calm. - Go on, I'll stay. - Where are you going? - For my dad's medicine. - I'll drive you. - Thank you very much. - Easy. I love you. - What? - I love you. I love you too. No matter what happens, remember I love you. Of course, love. What's wrong? What's wrong? A nightmare. Mom, did you meet the other Toms? - What Toms? - He was Natalia's boyfriend. No, but Natalia never dated a Toms. Yes, she told me he played soccer with Daddy and he was brave. And that's why she asked you to name me Toms. I don't know... I didn't know. Will you give me a hug, Tomi? - Good morning. - Good morning. Where do you get all your energy? What did you tell my son about an ex-boyfriend of yours called Toms? I told him he was named Toms after Martn. - What? - Sure. Toms was Martn's secret name, that's why I asked you. But you never told me. How could you ask me to call my son by somebody's war name? What do you mean "somebody"? It was Martn's. You liked the name and for me it was a tribute. A tribute would have been to have your baby instead of an abortion! Then you could have called him anything. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. What did you tell Toms about me? That you lived far away and that you were always very busy. That I was busy? - What did you expect us to say? - The truth. Tell a 6-year-old boy about exiled people so he'd be scared all the time? He's scared of me instead. Somebody told him I was a terrorist. I wish you'd told him... I know what you'd have loved. But at that time you couldn't say a word. I'm sorry, Natalia. I'm sorry. You know what? I'd like to know what Sebastin's uncle thought of me. Then buy a ticket, go to Argentina and ask for yourself. Your room's ready. Son of a bitch! Hold it tight. That's it. - Take another, go on. - All right. Now, focus. Like this? Ready? Whisky! - Another? - Ok. Whisky! - Now you take one of me. - Ok. Okay. Yes, now another. Mom, I'll take a picture of you. Ok. Ok, hug each other. Smile. Whisky! Clara? Yes. Yes, she's here. I'll put her on. Bye. Martn's mother. - Hello, Clara. How are you? - Darling, you were right, We found out through the tutor, that Morini could be involved, When are you coming? We need your father's book, Ok, I'll make a copy and send it. Thanks. Bye. - Natalia. - What are you doing here? You ok? - I'm fine. We need to talk. - No, no I can't. Natalia, I don't want you to go. I have to. They haven't eaten in a long time. I'll take you to Montevideo, get a ticket, you can go to Spain, stay with Sarita. To Spain? I can't leave them here. You'll do what I say. - The fuel! - Don't go! - Give me the fuel. - Don't go! I'm sorry. I must go. Natalia! Natalia! Get up. Get up. Get up. Walk. Fuck you. Get up. - We deserve a break, don't we? - Yes. Tomi, your milk's ready. Toms. - Toms... - What? Drink your milk. Careful. You'll break something. Take off your shoes, Natalia. Tomi, listen to me. Take off your shoes. I've cleaned the carpet for the party. - Take them off now. - Mommy, don't be "obsessive. " Toms. Go inside. I don't like you skating in the street. Tomi, I am talking to you. But there are no cars! - It's ok. I'm watching him. - You stay out of this. Tomi, I'm talking to you. Come here. You are such a pain in the ass. What did you say? What did you say? Don't ever talk to me like that again. You make me feel uncomfortable in my own house. You want my son against me? No, don't say that. We were finally making friends. I don't know if you were or not. Since you came, you haven't stopped asking questions. Why does it bother you so much? I don't know. I thought you came to visit us. Yes, that's why I came. To visit you. What a nice record! Dad blacklisted, anti-American sister. Good family portrait, couldn't you keep it for some other time? There's nothing to hide. This isn't a dictatorship. Exactly, so why talk about it right now? I organized this party for you, because I'm proud of you. Ok, I'm sorry. - I won't talk of politics anymore. - Please. You know what? I'll talk in Catalan from now on. Seriously. Talk about your trips, important people you know. When you want, you know how to talk. Make me look good. Excuse me, can I come in? You know how much your mom loves you? She was very young when you were born, and she was brave. She wanted you with all her heart. But she hit me. Yes, I know. She got nervous. Forgive her. But I didn't do anything! She's so cranky lately. And bossy. Because she wants to take care of us... You, me, your dad, even your grandparents. She's always been like that. Family is the most important for her. She doesn't want anything to go wrong. Let's go, there's a party outside. - How are you doing? - Fine. Fine? He's beautiful. - A party-crasher. - I invited him. Where did you find him? In a second-hand store. Are you saying yes like crazy? - Everything was fine, wasn't it? - Yes, really nice. Leave that now. Just a second, just arranging... I won't wash up. - Why don't you come to bed? - Ok. All right. Thanks. It was a nice party. I'm sorry. Why? I know... I was unbearable. I come to see you and we end up fighting. - I'm sorry. - No. I wish I could leave it in the past, but I can't. I know. - Sorry. - Don't say sorry. I need to know what happened. It's the least I can do for Martn. I'm sorry. This is the novel's end. I didn't want you to know anything. Because Dad was in jail and Morini said nothing would happen to Martn. It was me who said where Martn was. Elena. I think they want Martn. Do you know where he is? No, - but I can ask Natalia. - Don't even think about it. If Natalia warns them, Martn might do something foolish. Martn should turn himself in, confess and he'll be fine. His family's very powerful. They won't dare touch him. Whereas if your dad gets caught up in this, he'll never get out of it. I know the commissioner, but we must move quickly. If your father is sent to the Executive Power, I won't be able to do anything, and these guys don't mess around. If they want to make him talk, who knows if his heart will take it... Elena, you're the only one who can save your father. Where are you? Are you all ok? I'm fine, And Dad? He's fine. He's here. Nati, listen to me. Go to Chiche's. Mom's waiting for you there. - No, I can't, - Why? Where will you sleep? Nati, don't go to see him, I must go. Tell Mom and Dad I'm fine and I love them, - Natalia... Nati. - Give it to me. She's going to see Martn. I'm sorry, Dad. Forgive me. Ma'am, you can't go in there. Curfew in 40 minutes. I'll be right back. - You promise? - Yes. - All right. - Thank you. - Natalia. - Dad, what are you doing here? We need to talk. There are some clothes in the back. The plane leaves Montevideo at noon. Sarita will pick you up at the airport. She'll lend you some money. Got any photos? Yes. It's a couple of months... You'll see, sweetheart. You'll be back with pictures from Spain. Go on, get some sleep. Mom? It's me. I'm coming home. Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.
