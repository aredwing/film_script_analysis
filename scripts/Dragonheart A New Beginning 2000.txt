It was the year I became a novice at Brother Gilbert's monastery, when I first heard the prophecy: A dragon's heart could do mankind... when a two-tailed comet blazed across the night sky. I paid this leg end little heed, for I had come for a quiet life of prayer and devotion. Besides, everyone knew there were no more dragons. The last, Draco, had been slain by Sir Bowen, a knight of the old code. I later learned that in the last year of his life, Bowen returned to Draco's cave. There he was granted a miracle, a dragon egg about to hatch. The dying knight entrusted the hatchling to our monastery. Fearful evil might dwell in this dragon's heart, Friar Peter and the abbot pledged to hide him away... until the comet had passed. For 20 years, they carefully guarded... the secret locked beneath us. Eight days before the comet's arrival, my quiet life was turned upside down. Before the week was out, I'd be embroiled in deception, mystery and battle. And who could have known that Geoff, the orphan stable boy at our monastery, would reveal the deepest secret... of what is truly in a dragon's heart. [Man] Make way for the king's noble knights. Wishing to be one of them... won't get the stables cleaned any faster. Where do you think they're headed all dressed up like that ? They're off to the castle... to honor Lord Osric being sworn in... as the king's chief advisor. The castle. [ Bell Tolling ] I suggest you get back to the stable... before the abbot catches you around. I promise I will have the stables scrubbed cleaner than the abbot's table by vespers. And, Friar Peter, I will even clean that old dungeon for you, if you just unlock it for me. I'll tell you a secret about that dungeon: There's nothing down there... that can transform you into a knight. You're a good boy at heart. If you work hard and practice humility, you'll be a fine stable master some day. I'll be outta here long before I'm any kind of stable master. [ Man ] I, Lord Osric of Crosley, choose the old code as my oath. I am hereby sworn to valor, to speak only the truth, to use arms to defend the helpless, to use might to uphold the weak. My heart knows only virtue. My wrath will undo the wicked. My king. As chief advisor, my goal is nothing less than ensuring that the old code... lives on in the hearts and minds of all people. Everyone should share in our kingdom's bounty. Tomorrow, I shall bestow a personal gift... on all men, women and children in the land. A gift? Is it my birthday? No, Sire. [ Narrator ] Everyone was pleased when Lord Osric... was named chief advisor... since our beloved king's behavior had become so... unusual of late. Everyone will receive two new tunics... in the style and color suited to their inherited station. From now on, no one will wear anything else. [ Narrator ] There I was, so young, a mere novice entrusted with the monastery's most important secret. Silence was my solemn vow. Mansel, what are you doing ? Geoff. Looks like old Friar Peter's cauldron. What would you be doing with that ? Can you keep a secret ? You know I can. Friar Peter gave me a new chore to do. Ooh. Lucky you. What is it ? I told you, it's a secret. Fine. A secret chore from Friar Peter. That's pretty special. Don't you think ? Maybe just a little special, yes. Don't say it like that. Take some pride in being special. All right, I am special. It's not like pride's one of those seven deadly sins or anything. Actually, it is. [ Pig Squealing ] You're right, Geoff. Manual labor sure keeps the soul humble. - Thank you for getting me to do this. - Any time. Don't forget the corners. - [ Knocking ] - Yes ? Two most unusual strangers are asking after Brother Gilbert's writings. The abbot has sent them to you. Very well. This is Master Kwan and his son. I fear I don't have much hospitality to offer. Oh. I spent my youth in a monastery much like this one, but we do not seek comfort. We have come from Hebei Province, where man and dragons lived in peace. Many years ago, a terrible evil set dragon against man, and all our dragons were destroyed. A terrible tale. Though I have to say, I don't see... what this has to do with me. I'm told that the founder of this monastery... wrote extensively about dragons, and that you are the guardian of his scrolls. Brother Gilbert was a kind soul... with a fanciful imagination and a poor hand at poetry. It has been read in the stars... that a new dragon was born. Surely you are aware that the prophesied comet will return in eight days. We must prevent the evil from taking hold again. I am a man of God. I do not believe in such superstitious prattle. Then... the dragon talon in your pocket... is a meaningless talisman ? It has meaning only to the monks of this order. It was passed on by Brother Gilbert, who received it from Sir Bowen. He claimed it belonged to Draco, the last dragon. [ Kwan ] But we must test the dragon before the comet arrives. [ Friar Peter ] There are no dragons here. But Lord Osric knows about stars and comets. Perhaps he can help you. [ Kwan ] Thank you. Good night. What would Mansel be doing down here ? Ah. This was not a good idea. [ Screams ] [ Growling ] Stay away from me ! [ Growling, Sniffing ] [ Growling Continues ] You know, you-you'd better-- You'd better go. You're not supposed to be here. How long have you been down here ? I've always been here. - I'm Geoff. - I'm Drake. Here. Give me that. Seven lashes to anyone caught without their tunic. Those men from the East are still waiting, Lord. Show them in. Please. [ Kwan ] Thank you for seeing us. Not at all. It's an honor. We are on a quest related to the arrival of the two-tailed comet. Well, you don't have much time. According to my star charts and calculations, the comet will return one week from today. What do you hope to accomplish ? We seek the dragon of the prophecy. Hmm. A noble though nonsensical mission, since nothing is left of dragons but their legend. - Respectfully. I saw a dragon's claw just last night. - Did you ? Friar Peter claimed it belong ed to Draco himself, but can we be sure ? All this talk of dragons and prophecies... will frighten the common people. They're terrified of dragons, with good reason. For your own safety, you should leave this kingdom tonight. Stefan, see them safely to the border. [ Bell Tolling ] [ Narrator ] Back at the monastery, Geoff visited the dungeon... every chance he got. I suspect he hoped that knowing Drake... would somehow lead to adventure and fame. Geoff must have been sorely disappointed to learn he had befriended a dragon... who had no idea how to fly or breathe fire. Oh, come on, Geoff. Your tunic doesn't look that bad. I hate this thing. Itches and it's the color of worm vomit. That's not the color of my vomit. The old code doesn't say anything... about what you've got to wear to become a knight. Well, I've got about as much chance of becoming a knight... as I do of convincing you to come outside. Friar Peter made me promise that I would never go outside. You're a dragon. Act like one. Hey. Here. Allow me. It's Friar Peter. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He can't find you down here. Hide. Drake ? Yes ? I have sad news. M-Mansel ? What ? What is it ? Friar Peter is gone. Where did he go ? He went to heaven. Do you know what that means ? Oh, yes. Did it hurt him to die ? I don't think so. He seemed fine yesterday, but he was old. This morning he just didn't wake up. He was very fond of you, you know. I know I am not Friar Peter, but I will do my best to take care of you. I promise. Thank you, Mansel. [ Groaning ] I was just talkin' to him. I can't believe he-- I don't feel like talking now. I'd like to be alone. [ Whinnies ] It's that stable boy from the monastery. [ Man ] Oh, let's pay him a visit. Up. Up. Up. [ Whinnies ] Whoa. Hi. I saw you yesterday. I'm sorry I didn't stop to meet you. I'm Roland. I'm Geoff. Um, how was the castle ? Geoff. Old and stuffy, but you know how it is. - Well, I hardly ever go there anymore. - You've got a sword. You want to try your hand with us ? Sure. [ Man Chuckles ] The stable boy's not bad. We're just practicing. [ Screams ] [ Men Laughing ] If we weren't practicing, you'd be dead, stable boy. Now, lower your eyes. Peasants should never meet the gaze of their betters. [ Men Murmuring, Laughing ] - So, this is what it's like outside. - Drake ! You had to come out here now, didn't you ? I never got to say good-bye to Friar Peter. He was the only one who knew about dragons. You're lucky to have had him as long as you did. But my heart hurts. You won't feel this bad forever. [ Indistinct Chattering ] Today I make two edicts in accordance with the old code. To defend our helpless and uphold our weak, those people wearing green, beige and brown tunics... must be indoors one hour after sunset. Time for your evening tonic, sire. And from this day forward, only the words of truth will be spoken in our kingdom. [ Applause ] Who does Osric think he is ? Next thing you know, he's gonna be telling people what to think. If they wanna let him do that, he probably can. Well, not me. You're throwing your tunic away ? I don't think that's a very good idea. - Let's fly away from here. - But I don't wanna fly. Of course you want to fly. What do you think those wings of yours are for ? Hmm. You see those mountains ? Beyond those are-are other kinds of people... and treasure and adventure and glory. [ Geoff, Indistinct ] Hmm ? [ Kwan ] So he lives. The stars didn't lie. [ Man ] Those foreigners had to come back this way. They can't be far. Let's split up. [ Man ] This way! [ Geoff Shouting, Indistinct ] [ Kwan ] He's a very young dragon. We must not allow sentiment to interfere with our mission. That boy was at the monastery. And then we could come back and be more famous than Bowen and Draco. [ Growling ] All you have to do is just open your wings and jump. I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying right here. I like it here. If it's so easy, you show me how to do it. It would have been better for everybody... if I was the dragon and you were the stable boy. Go ahead. I'd like to see that. Stupid dragon. Oops. He's got no tunic. Let me read your minds. You wanna know why I'm not wearing my tunic. Yeah. Well, let me tell you... [ Continues, Indistinct ] - The boy can take us to the dragon. - It's a funny story, actually. You see, today was the day when... all the monks clean the privies. [ Man ] What's he take us for ? And old Friar Gustav must have thought that my tunic... was a rag or something, because he used it to wipe up-- Seven lashes for the tunic... and ten for the lie. [ Men Murmuring In Agreement ] We seem to have lost our way. Perhaps you can point us in the proper direction ? Lord Osric told you to get out of town. Now, the only direction I'll show you is toward the castle dungeon. Take him ! Be gentle with them. [ Grunting ] [ Both Grunting ] [ Man ] Come on ! [ Screaming ] You're a girl ? I'm Kwan. This is Lian. [ Men Yelling ] We should leave this area. This way! Get him ! Drake ! Drake ! I'm being followed. You gotta hide. If the guards see us, we're dead. Dead ? Dead ? I don't wanna die. What's happening to you ? Oh, my. [ Groans ] After him ! [ Whinnies ] [ Grunts ] Hello again. Nice day to run the horses, huh ? Where are the foreigners ? I don't know. They disappeared. No one can just disappear, unless I make them. All right. I give up. Take me to the dungeon now. You're not getting off that easy. [ Screaming ] [ Roaring ] [ Screaming ] I've got you. It's all right. Drake, you're flying. Of course we're flying. How do you think we got way up here ? Ah, this is great. Let's go up higher. Hey ! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. Let's swoop down and scare the villagers. Oh, no. This is dangerous enough as it is. Don't sound so scared. You've done the hard part already. Actually, I think the hard part is g oing to be getting down ! Everybody, look out ! Next thing I know, three Teregoths, just me. What's that up there ? [ Woman #1 ] Look at that. [ Woman #2 ] A dragon ! [ Gasping ] Geoff, any ideas, because I'm g etting tired ? [ Indistinct Chatter ] Lean right. Lean right. No, left. Whoa ! You have to lean right too. Get me the king's fastest horses. Look at that. A dragon. Four days till the coming. This alters everything. Flap a little faster. Whoa ! Too fast. Slow down ! The prophecy must surely be true. First Friar Peter's sudden passing, and now this. It's all my fault, Father. [ Osric ] Faster, men. Faster. [ Groans ] Would you loosen up ? I can hardly breathe. '' Lean farther. Fly faster. Hold looser.'' - I can't think of so many things at once. -J ust slow down, will you ? [ Screaming ] [ Geoff ] I think that was a little bit too slow. [ Coughing ] [ Growling ] We made it. You were great. Great ? Even though we crashed ? Absolutely! You are a natural. Thanks. Uh-oh. [ Men Yelling ] Who's smart idea was it to scare 'em ? Uh, uh, uh, start flapping. Start flapping ! I can't flap anymore. I'm exhausted. [ Angry Shouting ] [ Growling ] Watch out. That got in my eyes. Did you see that dragon that just flew by, headed east toward the mountains ? Uh, he was big, wasn't he ? Sure was fast. Probably never see him again. Must be miles away by now. Uh, he went that way. - Hold him ! - [ Man ] He's in there. Put those down ! [ Geoff ] You heard him. Put those down ! [ Peasants Murmuring ] Can't you see this is, uh-- Lord Osric, chief advisor to the king, at your service, [ Growling ] good drag on. He's a bit shy. His name is Drake. I'm-- I mean, we-we are all so glad to see you, Drake. And your friend here ? - Geoff. - An honor to make your acquaintance. When the king saw your magnificent form flying overhead, he requested a favor of service from you. - Me ? - Indeed. He wishes to appoint you protector of the realm. Geoff here will be adjunct protector of the realm. Is that anything like a knight ? A small step below. Oh. As you see, I was right, milord. You two again ? I thought you'd be intelligent enough to heed my advice and leave our kingdom. - Guards. - No ! These are my friends. [ Drake Growls ] These people are from far away. See how different they are ? [ Growls ] They do not follow the old code. Do not trust them. He is right. We should go home. [ Gasps ] Mansel. [ Growling ] [ Woman ] Oh, he's moving ! [ Man ] Stand back. Well, if-if they're friends of Geoff's, they're friends of mine. [ Man ] He speaks ! Well, then, they're welcome, of course, for as long as you want them to stay. The dragon will be an enormous help in protecting our kingdom. Nice of him to fly by when he did. His arrival was fate, not courtesy, Sire. With his help, we can vanquish the Teregoths once and for all. dd [ Bagpipes, Out Of Tune ] I need you to give me command of the army. dd [ Stops ] Immediately. dd [ Continues ] I'll interpret that as your royal approval. [ Mansel ] You have no idea what you've done. Of course I do. I got Drake out of that prison that you and Friar Peter locked him in... and I taught him to fly, and I got myself out of the stables. Only four more days. All I had to do was keep Drake safe. Then he would have been free to live his life, but you-- Safe from what ? What's gonna happen in four days ? A prophecy that says an ancient evil... will take hold of this land using a dragon's heart. Ancient evil ? Drake ? You got the wrong dragon. He doesn't have to be evil for evil to use him. Drake is an innocent. He's easily misled. Don't worry. I'll protect him. Who's going to protect him from you ? [ Sighs ] Excuse me, miss. Put those back. This is a monastery. We don't allow girls. [ Lian ] Please, no one must know that. Hey, Mansel ! You knew about her, didn't you ? Shame on you, Mansel. Don't you remember the abbot's sermon about that old tradition, sanitary ? - Sanctuary. - Yeah. Well, we should show her some sanctuary. You're a monk, Mansel. That's what monks do. All right. All right. - Don't worry. He'll keep your secret. - Thank you. I'm glad you're movin' in. The food is lousy, but the place more than makes up for that with its lack of excitement. You want help with those ? I can handle them. I've never seen anyone fight like you. Don't touch the ramhead ! Bad luck. Oh. I've never seen anyone fight like you. Where'd you learn to do that ? Master Kwan taught me. Do all girls fight where you come from ? Do you like wearing girl's clothes, or is that why you're dressed like a boy ? Can you believe all this fuss ? That's the boy who found the dragon. Isn't he just a stable boy ? Hey, Mansel, have you seen Drake ? All right. I'll keep looking. Hey, you have fun, 'cause it's not like gluttony is on that seven deadly sin list too. If it isn't that fencing stable boy at the castle at last. Well, your tunic doesn't seem so great now, does it ? You only have that tunic because you're friends with the dragon. Without him, you are still a peasant. Roland, Geoff's well on his way to becoming a knight. Isn't that true, Roland ? And what do you get if you don't tell the truth in our kingdom ? Ten lashes. One more word and I'll have to double that. Come with me. You've handled swords before. None like this. Then, shall we ? En garde. [ Narrator ] As the time grew near for Kwan and Lian... to test the purity of the dragon's heart, the gravity of what they might have to do... weighed heavily upon them. A shot through the heart with this poison... will kill him fast and clean. If he fails, he will feel no pain. Unlike all the dragon my great grandfather murdered. If you allow your misplaced guilt to affect you at the pivotal moment, you will doom us all, child. - Would you prefer if I-- - No. This is my burden. I will do what I must. I just pray that Drake passes this test. You have natural talent. You deserve special attention, my boy. Perhaps you'd consider taking rooms here at the castle. Me live here ? That way, I could tutor you personally. Where can my guards collect Drake's belongings ? Drake's ? I assumed you and him were a team. Well, I think he'd be too scared to leave the monastery. Poor creature. We wouldn't want to make him uncomfortable. I'm sure you can convince him to make regular visits. I'm sure he'd like that a lot. What do you think it would take for a stable boy to become a knight ? Now come at me faster. The most fundamental attribute of a knight is his commitment ! He should want it more than anything else. More than wealth. More than adventure ! [ Exhales ] More than friendship. Do you want it that bad ? Yes, I do. You'll make a positively heroic knight. It's written... in the stars. [ Growling ] This is what I wanted you to see. It is a ritual mask based on the most famous dragon in the East. But it... looks so angry. [ Kwan ] This amulet... has been imbued with all the wisdom of the ancient dragons. If you do as I say, you will receive all that knowledge in an instant. [ Drake ] I've always dreamed of learning about dragons, but how can I possibly learn so much all at once ? [ Kwan ] You must open your most vulnerable spot, your heart, to the dragon's mouth, then touch the amulet, and the wisdom will be yours. [ Drake ] Open up my heart ? Oh, you mean... like... like this ? Just touch the amulet. Drake ! Isn't there another way for me to learn ? I-I could teach you, but that would take years. I don't want to touch that thing. It's evil. [ Sighs ] [ Gasps ] What are you doin' to my dragon ? Nothing. Everything is all right now. That is most inappropriate. [ Man ] Get your dragon portraits ! [ Chattering, Laughing ] Drake ! Kwan said you passed some kind of test, so he's gonna teach you all the old dragon secrets. And I've got Osric practically begging me to learn how to be a knight. Isn't it great ? Look what I brought you from Osric's library. [ Drake ] What ? Books about dragons and knights. I do not trust him, nor do I trust this Osric. The danger is still great. We must stay close to the dragon until the comet has passed. [ Drake ] I've seen these stars before, through the grate in my room. They always made me feel better somehow. Those are the stars of the constellation Draco, the souls of your ancestors. [ Drake ] Tell me more. [ Kwan ] A long time ago, dragons ruled the earth. When people appeared, drag ons saw their potential for good... and shared their dragon wisdom, pledging to watch over humans and help them grow. The souls of dragons... who fulfilled that pledge became stars. Their spirits are still up there... comforting anyone who cares to look. Like a dragon heaven. [ Kwan ] Exactly. The last soul to join was a mighty drag on... who shared his heart with a prince... who was wounded in battle. While the dragon lived, the prince was invincible, sharing the dragon's strength... Really ? and his every pain. Oh. [ Kwan ] A dragon must be very cautious... before sharing his heart. If the human's heart is a corrupt one, the dragon can lose his place in heaven... forever. [ Drake ] That's awful. [ Growling ] [ Geoff ] Drake, look at this. [ Drake ] Why is that dragon chewing on a cow ? Looks like dinner to me. [ Drake ] Dinner ? Hmm. Come along, girl. [ Cow Mooing ] Where'd you go ? [ Moans ] My cow. [ Lian Yells ] [ Lian Laughing ] Not bad for your first lesson. Now attack me again. When exactly do I get to throw you ? [ Dog Barking ] Geoff ! Sorry I'm late. [ Burps ] - Excuse me. - Oh. Cow breath. - [ Drake ] What are you gonna teach me first, Master Kwan ? - Teach him to blow fire now. No, breathing fire is dangerous. [ Groans ] Stop being such a monk, Mansel. How does he breathe fire ? [ Kwan ] First, you must learn to open your fire lung. Inhale through your nose... and concentrate on passing the air deep in your throat. Fill your lungs. It will sound like this. [ Snoring Sound ] You try. Something's wrong. Get down. Turn that way so you don't hit the mill, then let it all out ! [ People Screaming ] [ Dog Barking ] [ Explosion ] You can call him protector of the realm, but he destroyed my mill ! He can't go 'round plucking up cows and flying off with them. [ Osric ] I can see you're both very distressed. I'm glad you came directly to me about this. Fix your mill. Buy yourself a new cow, and remember: our dragon is the last of a magnificent race. He deserves our utmost respect. Hmm ? Dragon lover. Peasants. Pay them no bother, lad. Small minds see what they wish and require guidance to understand the truth. Now, let us go outside and see Drake... so you can both tell me what really happened at the mill, hmm ? Drake didn't want to come. He's too embarrassed. Kwan tried to teach him how to blow fire, but it came out the other end. You left him with Kwan. And what else does the old man plan on teaching Drake ? I don't know exactly. Something about all the wisdom of the ancient dragons, I think. Bring the old man to me at once. Yes, my Lord. It shall be done. [ Drake ] No. No, no. This can't be right. All these knights are-are hurting dragons. [ Geoff ] Drake ! Sorry I didn't come home last night, but look what Osric gave me. W-Weren't we supposed to go flying this morning ? Well, Osric has a lot to teach me if I'm gonna become a knight. We'll fly tomorrow. [ Drake ] Geoff, you don't plan to be like the knights in this book, do you ? Sure. Just like them. Come on. Kwan and Lian are gonna teach you something new today. Is there something wrong with the air up here ? Well, if Friar Peter had ever let you open your shutters in the winter, you'd know. - It's fog. - Friar Peter didn't want him to catch cold. We should go back to the monastery before Drake gets sick. Breathing ice is an old dragon secret... that few were able to master. That's him. This way. You have a sense of your fire lung now. Your ice lung is beside it. Do you know how to generate sputum ? What ? He means do you know how to spit ? Well, then why didn't he say so ? Like this, Drake. - Ah. - That's very good. Sputum expelled with air from your ice lung will come out frozen. - Sounds simple to me. - You don't even have an ice lung. I don't have wings, but I figured out how to land. I will not stand by and let you berate him like that. What are you gonna do, Mansel ? Whip me with your tassel ? - [ Drake ] I can't make spit. -Just suck on your tongue, but don't swallow. Oh, come on ! You did that on purpose ! [ Drake ] I got some spit in my mouth. Open your ice lung and blow ! - Mansel, duck ! - What ? Oh, no. I've killed him. Mansel ? Are you all right ? I'm going back to the monastery before I catch my death. Here. Take my coat. Thank you. Got to get my anger under control, or something bad's going to happen. [ Groans ] [ Groaning Continues ] You're coming with us, old man. [ Lian ] Drake is pretty disappointed. [ Geoff ] He shouldn't be. Didn't Kwan say that most dragons can't breathe ice ? Geoff. Geoff, he is disappointed in you. In me ? Why, 'cause I didn't go flying with him this morning ? I have more important things to do if I'm gonna be-- Don't you know what a miracle it is Drake even exists ? Years ago, a dragon named Griffin... led a rebellion against our imperial city. When virtuous dragons captured Griffin, they took his heart as punishment and placed it in here. This is the withered heart of the betrayer of the dragon pledge. [ Geoff ] That's a dragon's heart ? The virtuous dragons brought this amulet to the Emperor Kuo-fan... as proof that the evil had been destroyed. But by then, the emperor was too fearful. He killed every dragon in the East. Drake is the last of his kind. He is more alone than you could possibly imagine. [ Man ] Now watch again closely. Toss smooth and easy. Like this. Now try it again, Sire. Better every day, Sire. [ Chuckles ] - Now open wide. - My Lord. [ Osric ] Ah, Master Kwan. How nice of you to visit. If you could just stay there for a moment, I have some vital affairs to discuss with the king. That's enough of your dalliance for tonight. Now put your official seal on this. What is this ? An order of succession, Sire, granting me your lands and powers in the unlikely event of your premature death. Oh, is that all ? Now off to bed with you. Good night, Osric. Sleep well, my King. Tomorrow's an important day. For when the comet arrives, this charade will end. Oh, yes, Master Kwan ! Stefan, how could you be so rude ? Take that old sack off our honored guest's head. I guess you weren't expecting me. My mistake. I'll take care of it. Ah. You've served me loyally for many years. Is that not right, Stefan ? Yes, sir. And in all that time, have you ever made a mistake before ? No, my Lord. [ Osric ] Watch closely, monk. [ Stefan Moaning ] I won't tell. I swear by the Holy Rood I won't say a thing. That's right. Just like your king. You won't say a single coherent thing. Now off to the dungeon with you like a good, little monk. It's hot in here. You are all incompetents ! I must do this myself. Take the guards to the monastery for Kwan. I'll meet you there with my knights. Tonight will bring an end to our deceptions. This disguise has served me well. I am comfortable here. Morning. New trouble approaches. [ Horses Whinnying ] [ Man ] All of us for one old man and a boy ? The old man and his son are coming with us. This has to be some kind of a mistake. I'll go talk to Osric. - You're not in charge here, squire. - We shall be gone tomorrow. You'll be gone now ! [ Yelling ] [ Chuckles ] [ Yells ] I might have known you'd end up with the rest of the swillage, stable boy. - Go to the cart. Pull the ram's head. - [ Yelling Continues ] [ Man ] Regroup ! Regroup ! [ Yelling ] - [ Whinnying ] - Stop this at once ! Told you it was a mistake. There is no mistake. Until the comet is passed, Kwan and his ward will be my guests at the castle. No. We must stay with Drake. But I thought you said-- [ Osric ] Geoff. These people are not like you and me. What do we really know of their intentions ? This is in Drake's best interest. Don't you agree ? All right. Um-hmm. [ Man ] Come on. Let's go. You too. Now, where is Drake ? It's time for him to assume his responsibilities as protector of the realm. The Tereg oths have attacked our border house. All the knights of the realm... are needed. [ Yelling ] [ Osric ] Onward, men ! To defend the country and the old code ! Come on, you ! I'm hot. Does the abbot know how hot it is down here ? Probably doesn't care. Old bully never lets anyone do what they want. Well, I'll talk as loud as I can ! Shh. Got to be quiet all the time. [ Cackling ] [ Yells ] I know you. Did you know your son is a girl ? They don't allow girls in the monastery. But I won't tell if you don't. I like girls. Hmm. [ Growls ] Geoff, I don't like the looks of this. This is exactly the kind of adventure we've been talking about. Drake, this is my big chance. Don't let me down. [ Osric ] Drake, stay here and guard our backs. Be careful, Geoff. Follow me. Stay close. The Tereg oths killed our border guards. Quiet. Something's wrong. Ambush ! [ Yelling ] Geoff ! No ! [ Yelling Continues ] [ Screaming ] Excellent job. [ Horse Whinnying ] Geoff ! Look out ! No ! [ Breathing Heavily ] Geoff, tell Drake to give me his heart. [ Growling ] How bad is he hurt ? You've got to share your heart with him. Are you sure ? - Hurry. He's dying. - He saved your life. I'll try. [ Growling ] Wait ! Stop ! - What ? - Something's wrong. He's not really hurt. He set us up. - [ Grunts ] - [ Osric ] Grab him ! - I would have knighted you tonight. - [ Drake ] Let him go ! But there's no valor in you, stable boy. [ Drake ] No ! No ! Don't hurt him ! Give me your heart, or he dies. - [ Yelling ] - [ Drake ] Come on, Geoff! Run ! After them ! Let's go ! - Oh, no. - [ Man ] He's down ! Geoff, get down ! Whoa. It is my destiny to become king... and rule over man. By all the stars in heaven, I will have that heart tonight ! dd [ Humming ] [ Burps ] dd [ Humming Continues ] Who are you ? How did you get in here ? I just woke up and was here. Where's the monk and the boy and the old man ? Shh. Uh, who ? [ Man ] Come here ! Put your hands through the bars. [ Chuckles ] Come on. They need us at the front gate. Mansel ! Hello ? [ Chuckles ] Do you have the ingredients to brew an antidote ? Yes. Black lotus. He must have been to the Orient. You were right not to trust Osric... and the boy. Though it was insolent of me to point it out so boldly, Highness. You haven't called me that in a long time, Master Kwan. Oh, you will grow accustomed to it again soon enough. Drink this, Mansel. This way, Sire. dd [ Humming ] What's that sound ? It's music. I like music. [ Man ] You're not supposed to be-- [ Groaning ] Highness. But have I not had my medicine ? This is a new potion, Highness. It will clear your head. [ Man #1 ] Surround 'em ! [ Man #2 ] Take this side. You came here looking for the dragon and found him. Now, I must find him, and time grows short. Where is he ? I have been your honored guest all day. How could I possibly know ? A girl. - You look familiar. - Perhaps you met one of my relative... while you were gathering herbs to poison your king. The amulet of the Chinese emperor, Kuo-fan. [ Kwan ] I understand now. - So, it is you ! - Who, Master Kwan ? In the flesh. Throw the amulet in the fire ! [ Yelling ] I thought this was destroyed. Daughter of the house of Kuo-fan. On the night of my destiny, I repay you for your ancestor's sins ! No ! [ Gasps ] I have... failed you. Kwan, now shh. You are my loyal servant, my wise master... and my closest friend. [ Sniffling ] [ Geoff ] Hurry, Drake ! The prodigal dragon returns. You'll be pleased to know you can keep your heart... as the little empress here was kind enough to provide me with this. Murderer ! He killed Master Kwan, and he's about-- Silence ! Kuo-fan was the murderer, as was Bowen ! Bowen was a knight of the old code. I've shown you the true meaning of the old code. It's a way to control people weaker than you ! No, Bowen's real legacy was written in the blood of dragons. But one solitary dragon... escaped Bowen's wrath and fled to the East, a dragon who learned that the pledge to serve mankind... was nothing more than a cruel joke ! Oh, oh, he sought his revenge, but in the end, his heart too was... plundered, and he... was cursed... to live out his life... in the form he hated most: as a man ! [ Drake Growls ] But tonight-- Tonight that curse is ended. [ People Gasping ] [ Heart Beating ] - [ Rumbling ] - The heart of the prophecy was never Drake's. It was Griffin's. Drake, child. Come. There's another dragon ? [ Griffin ] Little brother, we must teach mankind their place as our servants. Come to me, and we'll fulfill the comet's prophecy together. Y-You called me brother. [ Griffin ] Come. I'll teach you what it really means to be a dragon. - Drake, don't go ! - That's it, brother ! Geoff, I'm not alone. Drake, listen to me ! I know that I hurt you, and I'm sorry, but he's going to enslave mankind forever. Get out of Drake's way! Geoff ! [ Drake ] Geoff! If it wasn't for Geoff, I would've given you my heart... and lost my soul. He's my real brother ! Poor choice of siblings, Drake. [ Explosion ] Drake, use your tail ! You'll pay for that, peasant ! Ice ? How did you-- [ Yells ] Oh ! Geoff ! We made it ! Geoff ? He's gone. Step away. Mansel, what are the words ? I offer my heart... to make you whole, [ Drake ] To make you whole, [ Both ] its strength to purify your weakness. [ Breathing Deeply ] [ Gasps ] Geoff. What happened ? My heart hurts. You mean our heart hurts, but it won't feel this bad forever. [ Narrator ] And so, evil was vanquished, and the old code restored. Lian returned to her royal duties for a time, while I came home to the monastery... and was awarded guardianship of Brother Gilbert's scrolls. A life of prayer and devotion was mine at last, but it was a great deal quieter than I remembered. As for Geoff and Drake, they finally had what they'd really wanted from the start: a brother, a family. See the sun's last glimmering ray Fading fast to end our day Though I long for you to stay Spirits call and you obey You'll fly far from me Though in truth you're still home Sail across the sea Nature blooms Where you roam When trees grow The leaves show My heart goes with you Hear the hush whene'er you sigh Sorrow weeps down from the sky Though we've whispered our good-bye Everywhere you go Am I From this life you flee As the draft grows so cold Oh, and now you're free Feel the future unfold As winds blow The breeze shows My heart goes with you When streams flow All shores know My heart goes with you You'll fly far from me Though in truth You're still home Sail across the sea Nature blooms Where you roam When trees grow The leaves know My heart goes with you When trees blow Duration: 01:20:32,007 25 fps Subtitle by willi
