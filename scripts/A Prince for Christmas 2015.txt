cornet 2nd left-hander walls back that's like that cupcake why not two coffees and two other creams thanks Wendy got it got it at the time to check out your little town it's everything you said it would be I wouldn't steer you wrong must have our time you know the snow and icicles all of the lights you must intrude magical christmas is here used to do not so much lately you know how it is just don't always have a lot of time to celebrate mom you and your business school takes a lot to die now is my father's dream but now barely makes enough to keep the lights turn on it can trim and keep dad's dream alive then the walk close to your own dreams analysis doesn't she want to have a proper Christmas she does and she will thank you but what I really want to see what life is like in other places must be so fascinating different I mean I love this little town i do that i know that there's this big old world out there waiting for me i wish that i could show you that world guess you

might be confusing happiness with you Tara tell me is there something going on here I don't know I'm kind of new at all this another thing my timing was terrific with today being you know I know her parents were good people that's so sad what happened to them it was a car accident four years ago today they just bought the Christmas tree and they were driving home when they hit a patch of black ice Emma and Alice were pretty banged up but person Julie didn't make it I'm terrible mm it's always hard to lose a parent but to lose both them in that way it Christmastime it's just tragic I had no idea and our memories raising his sister Alice yep she's put her entire life on hold to take care of your little sister that hand keeping her father's diner open that's what drives our everyday emma is a remarkable girl so how do you know her we met at the diner ship around this afternoon mhm would that have something to do with why you missed your train today it might have something to do with that yes people now I know this is none of my business but let's just say hypothetically someone were interested in Emma and they asked my advice well with everything that she's been through I think she would really appreciate it if someone were to offer her some help for a change hypothetically of course yeah yeah Your Majesty anything he's still here never boarded why not i'd venture to say he was highly distracted what kind of distraction five today good work Jeffrey would you like me to intervene sir em they're Russian not yet just stand close by in case he needs you shot reportedly well what about the Queen mm let's just keep this between ourselves now understood your majesty our not good night but yes yeah there you are mother is there any news on Duncan know my love nothing yet i know it's all my fault i've driven him away simple as that wedding of this magnitude would be stressful on anyone it wouldn't be a wedding of this magnitude if it wasn't for me I mean you only get married once and I just wanted us to be the most perfect wedding and now we have everything at stake Ariana they just titles that's all I was Duncan's age once and I know what he's going through he just needs time that's all really mm don't think I didn't have reservations even about our wedding that's true and we worked out all right didn't we yes we did and that's because no one made us get married we got married because we wanted to and I promise you all will be well and Duncan will come home it's certainly better I have a delivery for gorgeous let me see oh there for you from you know who yeah I know you need your time to think but don't take too long only five days until sandals you under my tree love Todd ok take the good morning and beginning to think you don't actually have a train to catch it all why is there a sale sign outside and gets time to wake up and realize I can't keep going like this and the money would come in handy maybe I can help you but and it's Christmas this place should be packed and really is dead mother's day an orphanage but what I'm trying to say is that perhaps selling the diner isn't the only option maybe we can liven things up a little bit at least try we yes let me introduce your customers to some mutations something a little bit out of the parts but you have to leave you serious absolutely right we have mine is what I was thinking yeah yeah you go everything on your list except for suet nobody here knows what sue it is ok well nice try max I'm dying to see what you're gonna do with all this stuff well I've got a few tricks up my sleeve you have a passion for international cuisine I like cooking for people if that's what you mean this burger flipping is only temporary until I open my own place really you're in place to be the only gourmet restaurant in all of the roar but first i gotta pass the interest exam to get in the culinary school I was stopping unfortunately school and was never my thing so here I am slinging outlets well i can help you if you like you have the time i'll make time yeah exactly you know the best piece of advice anyone ever gave me trust your instincts you got this man I'm almost afraid to

engaged to marry we are not engaged it will be Christmas so why don't you just you know whether off people call it right ok enough you think official standstill let's go so yeah yeah yeah we might be none of my business but would you mind explaining what happened Todd's not a bad guy was just hurt that makes a man crazy sometimes so you actually went down with that guy I did we grew up together when you live in a small town like this you'll find their own a lot of efficiency so settling becomes a real thing Emma teehee yourself I know yes after a while you realize that no one's gonna show up on a white horse and sweep you off your feet there is no prince charming yeah first has do come true sometimes for me they don't have a few big decisions to make Palace think i'm gonna make them

hold on Prince whatever happened just passing through and going where fate takes you believe it or not i think this is my fate took me besides you were the one who said i might appreciate a little more help i was thinking more along the lines of a gift card for massage or something well next time you might be a little more specific well it sounds like things are heating up with you David Beckham is different you know nobody don't like that before he's polite and the girls back and suddenly the ones that I got was just so proper doll whatever you know she's different she's smart she's
