Both are armed and dangerous. Over. Clear. Crap. Come on, man. Don't make me come in there... ...looking for you. Just bought a new suit. Fine. We'll do it the hard way. I had him, you know. You okay? Yeah. Flesh wound. Where's Victor? Running. Go. I got this one. Come on, Danvers. Isn't this what you want? Huh? To bring down the infamous Victor Abbott? I'm right here. You should have killed me when you had the chance. What the hell are you laughing at? Hands on your head. I said hands on your head. You lucky prick. Damn it. On your knees. You okay? So they tell me. Who was President the last time you saw... ...a doctor? Bush. Yeah, you should probably get that... ...checked out. Did they take care of Griffin? Yeah. Rolled him out of here handcuffed... ...to a stretcher. Just like his big brother here. High-five, buddy. Maybe next time. My ringer is off. Leave a message. Hey, babe. Uh, I'm getting out... ...a little bit early today. I'll see you soon. I'll be seeing you real soon. Ready to roll? Mace? You okay? - Yeah. Ooh-hoo. Real nice, Mace. Real nice. Make the guy who got shot drive. I thought you were tough, pretty boy. Whoa. Oh, I hate it when you do that. Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Another page-turner? It's awful. Some woman from work lent it to me. Seems like everyone in the office is reading it. I don't understand how they can read this crap. I must be some kind of freak... ...for not liking it. You're my freak. Aw. Why are you home early? And what is that all about? If you turned the ringer on your cell phone on... Oh, forget it. I don't care enough to be reprimanded. What do you want to do for dinner? I was thinking of making some chicken enchiladas... ...with rice and beans. You lie. Yeah. He must have been pretty awful... ...to hold your attention for that long. Mmm. What did he do? What didn't he do? Drugs, racketeering, murder for hire, murder for fun. Real bad guy, then? Real bad. I guess it was worth the black eye. Definitely. I've got some not so great news. What's that? I'm still not pregnant. Then we're gonna just... ... Have to keep trying, won't we? Well, that is the fun part, so... It is the fun part. Dessert? Yes, please. Cookies or ice cream? Yes, please. Mmm. Cocktails? I wish I could. Bureaucratic process calls. You have fun with that. Call me if you change your mind. Bad news. Bethwick from county called... ... about Victor and Griffin Abbott. She said some key witness mysteriously went missing. They don't have enough to still hold them for trial. Charges were dropped. Both brothers walked this afternoon. Damn it. Joce? Hey, baby. Change your mind about that drink? Victor Abbott is inside my house. Hello, Mrs. Danvers. Help. You come here with me. Shh. Please. I'm pregnant. On the floor. I said on the floor now. Now. Joce? Son of a bitch. Mason. He's not worth it. He's not worth it, Mace. Drop your gun. Detective Danvers. Mace, listen to him. You put that gun down, all right? You put that gun down. Now. Now, Mace. Let's go. Come on. God, we thank you for the life that you give us. It is full of work and responsibility, sorrow and joy. Today we thank you for Jocelyn Danvers. For what she's given and received. Help us in our mourning and teach us to live... ...for the living... ... in the time that is still left to us. Let us pray. Hey, Mace. Baldus said to take as much time as you want. I want you to know... ...Anything you need, Mace. Anything. You just... ...You say the word, all right? Here. Thanks. You did the right thing. There's nothing you could have done. So, are you going to take my advice? Get out of here? Clear your head? Yeah. I gotta get out of here. Good. Good. Where are you going to go? Hunting trip. Hello? Whatever I need. Right? Of course. 3611 South 9th Place. Mace... Yo, I need to see some beers. Where'd you get this? Where'd I get it, man? That ain't none of your business. Hey. Oh, yeah. Don't. Well, if it isn't know-it-all cop. Drop it. You know why I'm here? Yeah. Because you don't have a wife to go home to. Wrong fucking answer. Mace... What the hell? On your feet. One at a time, single file. Just like in kindergarten. Fresh fish, Will. Hey. Yo. Yo, sonny. Look at me. Look at me, man. You're mine. You hear me? You're mine. That's right. Welcome to Stonewall. Today you will receive a medical evaluation. You will strip down, shower, and be issued a uniform. You will receive a cell assignment. You will meet your cellmate. Get to know him. You will be spending a lot of time together. I am Oswald. Oz for short. Mason. Word is you used to be some kind of hero cop. You've got an appointment, Danvers. Let's go. Enter. Mr. Danvers. Warden Snyder. Please have a seat. Thank you, Will. We'll be fine. Welcome to Stonewall. You're a bit of a celebrity now, aren't you? Lauded by cops. Hated by criminals. But any press is good press, right? With that said, I feel very fortunate... ...to have you here. I mean, after all, you could have ended up... ...in any old prison. Am I right? I'm not judging, of course. 'If you have strings to pull, by all means, pull away.' In fact, that brings me to my first point. Stonewall can be a very... ... Challenging place. Especially for an ex-cop like yourself. But I just wanted you to know that you can... ...count on me as an ally. My door is always open. In fact, as an initial show of good faith, I've arranged for you to work in the laundry. Now, I typically don't afford that type of luxury... ...for the new inmates, but it was very important for me... ... that we started off on the right foot. After all, first impressions are everything. Are they not? Yeah. Well, then. Will? Please escort Mr. Danvers back to his cell. Mr. Danvers? It was my pleasure. Detective Danvers. Or should I say, inmate Danvers? How's that first meal treating you? Look, last time we saw each other... ...things were a little... ... Tense. I mean, what, with you crying like a little bitch... ... over your wife's dead body. The last dead body I stood over... ...belonged to your brother. Well, the way I look at it, I still came out on top. I mean, after all, I did get two for... ...the price of one. Let's get one thing straight. This is my house. The only thing that badge will... ...get you in here... ... is a slit throat. Hey. Yo. Keep going. Hey. Excuse me, Detective. Grab him. Look at me. I said look at me. Hey. This is C.O. Wilson. We have an inmate... ...down in the laundry. We need a med team in here. Mason. Come on, Mason. Come on. Stay with me. He lives. Barely. You know, when they called me, I thought I was gonna be identifying a body. You're lucky. Mace, that night you called me out... ...to Griffin's place, did you know how it would play out? I called you because you're a good cop. Mason, this isn't gonna bring her back. I know. Ben Wilson? What are you doing in here? I've been here since I quit the force. It isn't too demanding. You get stuck doing a lot of stuff, who end up in a pool of their own blood. It wasn't exactly a fair fight. Oh, it never is. Especially when the other side... ...of that fight... ... is coming from Victor Abbott. So, Abbott is running things inside here? Oh, he's running things in here and out there. He's built quite the network for himself over the years. And the two lap dogs? Drexel's in charge of sales. You need something within these walls. Drexel delivers. He doesn't care about skin or gang colors. The only color he cares about is green. And Stonewall is full of paying customers. Booker? Well, he's head of human resources. When Victor needs to hand out a pink slip, Booker delivers the bad news. Abbott's been in Stonewall for less than a year. How did he grab control so quickly? You get enough blood on your hands, eventually people give you what you want. After that, they do your dirty work for you. Doesn't matter where you are, in here, out there, it is all the same to them. Bitch. If that's true, then why would Victor risk... ... getting thrown back inside? He was out. Completely in the clear. When they sent Victor back to Stonewall, they didn't lock him up. They just put a fortress around him. This is where he thrives. Time's up, Danvers. Good seeing you again, Ben. Mmm-hmm. Hey, Mason? Abbott may be the body of the snake, but he's not the head. Do yourself a favor and remember that. Will do. Danvers. So, you've healed? Enough. That's good to hear. Mob mentality and vendettas have no place in my prison. Eventually those responsible for your current state... ... will be discovered. And I promise you, they will be dealt... ...with properly. Anyway, welcome back to general population. Abbott may be the body of the snake, but he's not the head. Do yourself a favor and remember that. So, what's so urgent I had to get down here... ...immediately? You remember Ben Wilson? Ben Wilson? Yeah, vaguely. Well, he's working here now. He said something to me the other day in passing. It just didn't sit right. I want you to find out how many people... ... have walked from Stonewall early. Abbott's not in this alone. Victor could not have free reign... ... without someone like Snyder. Why must everyone disappoint me? You're done. Hey. You ain't so bad without your boys, huh? Get up. Yo, you heard about Flynn? - What about him? Bet you it was Danvers. I just heard some stuff. Marco's dead. I know. Flynn, too. What? Guards found him in the kitchen... ...with a broken neck. Son of a bitch. So? What are we gonna do? You aren't gonna do anything. But I'm next, Vic. And I'll deal with it. You hear about Flynn and Marco? Whole yard's whispering. Think it's our friend? It appears that way. Seems a little above his pay grade, don't you think? Flynn and Marco? Those two were a couple of spoons... ...in a drawer full of knives. Fair enough. You should arrange for another reminder. Make sure this one is a little more direct. Get up. I'm here to deliver a message. Message received. You've created quite a predicament for me. Oh, what to do, what to do? You nearly killed a man. With a sink, no less. That's very, very impressive. And while I can quietly admire... ...your feat... ... inside this office, I cannot allow it to go unchecked... ...inside this prison. So maybe we can come up with an arrangement... ... that would be mutually beneficial. Would that interest you, Mr. Danvers? No. Well, that is a shame. We're done here. Will? Take Mr. Danvers to the hole. One week. Let's go. I'm curious, do you have a mutually beneficial agreement... ...with Victor Abbott? Hey. How are you holding up? I'll survive. Who the hell hits someone with a sink? You guys should watch yourselves, though. That cat, he ain't playing around. Neither are we. So what you thinking? Hmm? We done playing? Are you giving orders now? No, man. I'm just wondering how much damage... ... this punk's got to do before we take him out. Look, I need Snyder on board before we retire Danvers. Now, we got a good thing going on in here. We don't need our business going public. He's cut off in here. Who's gonna notice if he goes missing? You're back in the laundry tomorrow. What? I need a favor. Hey. Victor's looking for you. Yeah? Where's he at? He's in your cell. I wouldn't keep him waiting. Yo, Vic? That old, fat prick said you were looking for me? Leaving already? Huh? But you just got here. You fucking shut up. Shut up. Enter. You've got a visitor. Abbott wants to see you. If it's not one thing, it's another. Let him in. Victor. It's so nice... ...My patience is running real thin with Danvers. Sit. Now, you were saying? He's killed three men. Yes. And I told you, you are not to touch him. There's too much heat. He's a cop and a celebrated one at that. And I don't need that kind of attention. It's bad for business. This whole cat and mouse game... ... is getting really old with Danvers. Now, I don't know how he got in here... ...You really don't know how he got... ...into Stonewall, do you? Think. You let him in. Not exactly. He certainly has friends in the right places, but I do have final say over who lives under my roof. Are you insane? He's here on a rampage. Mmm. And why would that bother me? We had a deal. Say that again. We had a deal. Had. We had a deal and that deal... ...was contingent... ... on you being on the outside. Remember? I arrange for a witness to disappear and you walk. And you repay that kindness... ... with half of whatever business you do... ... out there. Not in here. You... ... Are of no use to me in here. But... But nothing. Revenge was more important to you than business. And that reflects poorly on me. And I can't allow that to go unnoticed. However... ... There may be an opportunity for you to redeem yourself. Hello? Detective Gainer? Speaking. Joel Gainer? This is prison medical from Stonewall Correctional Center. One of our inmates, a Mason Danvers, unfortunately, he was found... ...beaten to death... ...in his cell earlier this evening. Mr. Danvers listed you as his emergency contact. And I'm calling because we'd appreciate it... ...if you could come in and identify the body. Yeah. I'll be right over. Thanks for coming on such short notice, Officer. Hello, Officer. Thank you for coming out to identify the body. Well. Let's get this show on the road. Get your hands off him. I'm right here. I'm here. Now, now, now, now. You wanna help your boy? Go help your boy. Always one second too late, aren't you? Enter. It's done. Good. Thank you, Lester. Dump the body. What? Some colleagues are nervous about staying involved. Saying shit is just too hot right now. They think Danvers is burning... ...a path straight to you. And that he'll run over anyone who gets in his way. There's also whispers about him having help. Silent partner? Snyder. No. Snyder and I are square. You sure about that, Vic? We got guys talking big. Saying they're gonna make a play for power. They think you're losing it, Vic. It's this cop. He's got up all in your head, making you act all... ... Regardless, loyalties are strained. Hey. What does he want? He won't say. Well, then bring him in. Tell me more about this mutually... ...beneficial arrangement. Wait outside. What do you want from me? Sit. What does anyone want? A helping hand. Running a prison is tougher than it looks. It's hard maintaining order in a place... ... filled with so much filth and chaos. Most times, rules and regulations... ...maintain that order. But sometimes, this job requires other tactics. That's where you come in. Killing people. Oh, you make it sound so sinister. Don't be so dramatic, Danvers. You act as if I'm asking you to do something... ... you don't feel comfortable with. Clearly, your track record speaks otherwise. Why me? You have the skills of a cop... ... and the constitution of a cold-blooded killer. What better combination could there be? And besides, I think we both can agree... ... that we share at least... ... one common goal, don't we? Out with the old, in with the new, and all that. Am I right? Let's shake and make it official. First, I need something from you. Well, well. Do tell. What? You have a meeting with the warden. It's the middle of the night. Then you take it up with him. What're we doing in here? The warden wants to have a word. What's it about? I'm just the deliveryman, Booker. Yo, man. What's with the secret meeting? What did you... ... What did you inject me with? Shh. Don't try to talk. Don't try to scream. 'Cause you can't. Stressful, isn't it? Sitting there. Unable to move. Not sure what the hell is going to happen next. Just like my wife felt... ... when Victor Abbott stood over her... ...and bashed in her head. Mmm-mmm. Don't look at me. You'll miss the show. Danvers dies now. Sorry, he just... We're fine. Sit. Oh... ... Now what's wrong? Does someone need a hug because their... ...friend bled out? You are aligned with him. I should have listened to Booker. Well, at least you won't have a chance... ... to make the same mistake twice. Why are you doing this? You're being traded in for a newer model. No. Will. Will. I should kill you right now. Yes. This ain't over yet. There's your boy. I don't know, Vic. I don't care. He dies now. Here we go. On your bellies, now. Now. Get down. Repeat. All prisoners in their cells. Get down. I heard about your little incident in the cafeteria. I had to get out of Dodge. That was the quickest way. You broke Artie's nose, you know. That was the name of the guard you hit. Artie. Tell Artie it wasn't personal. Yeah. He's kind of a prick anyway. You mind if I ask what you're trying to do here? What do you mean? All of it. Punching guards. Spending time in the hole. Why? You know what they say about you... ...in here, don't you? Yeah, they say you're truly crazy... ... and they don't want any part of it. Although, I think some of them are silently rooting for you. Well, what about you, Ben? Are you rooting for me? I haven't picked sides since the seventh grade. That's why I'm still alive today. You keep smoking those things, you may not be alive tomorrow. You're probably right. If they ask where that came from, don't rat on me, all right? All right. Here. Keep that in return for your silence. That was you in the laundry that day, wasn't it? Might have been. If it was you that saved my ass that day, thank you. Well, if it was me, I'd tell you you're welcome. Otherwise I'd think you were probably... ...looking for it. Ben? If it comes down to it, can you do it? Do what? Pick sides. You take care of yourself. I apologize that you've had to spend... ...some time down here. After all, it was all about maintaining appearances, am I right? Indeed, I am. I heard you put on quite a show. Still, while we have an agreement. I can't have you... ...We have no agreement. Excuse me? I don't need you anymore. Oh. Did you make that boy bleed out... ... onto the floor all by yourself? I don't think so. Victor Abbott may have killed my wife, but we both know who let him out. As long as you're in charge, people like him are gonna continue... ...walking out of here. Every time we put 'em in. Are you threatening me? Do you feel threatened? You're a dead man, Danvers. You know that, right? From day one. I believe an apology is in order. So... ... Go on. Danvers. I placed an official transfer request for you... ...this morning. Once the superintendent approves it, and he will, your time in Stonewall will be up. And your little game will be over. Take this shit back to his cell. Let's go, Danvers. I have information. Word is you're transferring out? Seems to be a popular topic of conversation these days. Abbott's been having meetings on the roof. Seems him and Drexel... ... have an even earlier exit plan scheduled for you. They, uh, meet in the mornings... ... before the guards start their shifts. Everyone knows to stay clear. Drexel's alone up there right now. That help? Maybe. Thanks. You're so bad you gotta sneak up... ...on a brother, huh? Huh? Hold him up. Don't fucking move. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. What are you doing? Huh? Open the door. What? Open the door. Okay. Okay. Okay. What are you doing? Shut up. What the hell's going on up there? Keep moving, ladies. Come on, you don't hear that? Keep moving. No. No, no. No. No. What. Stonewall to base. We've got a riot in the yard. Inmates are armed. I repeat. Inmates are armed. You did this. I did. Right after I dropped Drexel off the roof. Will. On top of Will. You lie. I don't see him rushing in here to save you. Guards. Take him outside and put a bullet... ...in the back of his head. Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir. Danvers. what it felt like to be your wife that night? Let me show you. Follow me. You're done, Mr. Danvers. This all could have been avoided. I want you to remember that when you die. Victor? I'll let you do the honors. And don't screw it up this time. Do it. Do it. He helped me kill Booker. He threw Drexel off the roof. This is my house you've been living in. It always has been since the day I came to Stonewall. Now, where did we leave off? Right about here. You drop them. You don't wanna do that. Drop them. Okay. Fine. No. That's for Gainer, you son of a bitch. Of course. Help me, Vic. Ammo. Look at me. I said look at me. Attaboy. I want you to see this coming. Say hi to your wife and kid for me. Goodbye, Mr. Danvers. No. I don't think I can let you do that, Warden. Drop it. What is it you think you're doing? They're placing you under arrest. For what? For what. Extortion. Murder. A little bit of everything. You picked a side. Yeah, well. It seemed like as good a time as any. Hey, Warden? See you soon.
