CMA 1307A was found on her left side struggling. Right behind you. Her blowhole was largely underwater. Okay, don't stress it. Bring in the stretcher! She had small lesions, mucus coming out of her eyes... and was severely sunburned. A common problem with beached dolphins... as their skin isn't adapted for prolonged exposure to the sun. The team suspected possible lung infection, which led to her being disoriented... which led to her beaching. This dolphin was nicknamed Mandy, after the little girl who discovered her. It's 92. It's really, really high. Now, science doesn't know whether dolphins feel emotions... the way we do: fear, joy, sadness. But their brains are as complex as ours... and to us, Mandy seemed terrified. So, like always, we treated her as gently as we treat one of us. We managed to get her into a stretcher and over to the rescue vehicle... Breath! ...which wasn't easy, as the area was a mud flat. - Phoebe, you all right? - Watch your step. Mandy was eight and a half feet long and weighed approximately 350 pounds. Breath. - Watch your step. - Thanks, Kyle. When we got her back to CMA, we immediately began giving her... fluids and antibiotics for her respiratory infection... as well as a topical ointment for her sunburn. Since then, she's been gaining strength every day... and is well on the road back to being a healthy animal. All right. Next session, we'll go into more details about strandings. I just want to thank you for volunteering. You guys are what keep this aquarium going. You and really big truckloads of fish. See you Wednesday! Hi. Excuse me? Sorry, we just wanted to say thanks. We volunteered because we heard all about you and Winter. All Susie ever talks about is dolphins. She wants to be just like you. - I do not! - Sawyer! We're starting in 10 minutes. Oh. Right. Excuse me. Hi. I'm Hazel Haskett, and welcome to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium. Fifteen years ago, my mom and dad bought an old sewage treatment plant... and turned it into a hospital for sick and injured marine animals. Their goal was to rescue, rehab and release as many animals as they could. Today Clearwater Marine Aquarium is home to turtles, otters, sharks, and dolphins... including Winter, the famous dolphin with the prosthetic tail. If you're interested in volunteering at CMA... please see our staff at Guest Services. Enjoy your day here at Clearwater Marine Aquarium. Shoo! Hey! What the heck...? - Oh. - My bear! Rufus, no! I'm sorry, honey. Are you okay? Ma'am, I am so sorry. If you can't control your pelican, you really shouldn't have him here. He's not exactly our pelican. Whose pelican is he then? You know, I don't think he really belongs to anybody. You okay? Look, I really would like to make it up to you. How about if I take you down to the gift shop? And I'll get you something new. Anything. Is that okay, honey? Hi, guys! Welcome to Clearwater Marine Aquarium! How's everybody doing today? Thank you. We are so excited that you chose to spend your day with us. And today we have a very special guest. Please give a warm welcome to champion surfer, Bethany Hamilton! Thank you, Hazel. I am so stoked to be here. How about everyone out here? You stoked? And being able to spend time with Winter, who has just been... such an inspiration for me, and I'm sure to you as well. Isn't she just amazing? So thank you! Winter usually does three sessions a day with her prosthetic... and as you can see, she really likes it. With it on, she's able to swim normally, and already... it's helped to correct the damage to her spine... and she's able to live a healthy, happy life. Do you see her? Hold it out where she can see it. You okay? Cut it out! Looks like Winter's being extra playful today. She's being a brat. - Maybe it's me. - No, no, she loves people. She's just in a weird mood, for some reason. She's refusing. Can you gate Panama? I think she's distracting. That's Panama. She was rescued 12 years ago, unable to catch fish. And we found out why. It's actually because she's deaf, which makes her unable to echolocate. She's also very old for a dolphin. Over 40, we think. Heh. I know. It's really old. Heh. But she and Winter are the best of friends. There she goes! - Hey, Doc. - Hey. How are you? So glad you could make it down here. Glad to be here. Good girl, Winter. Good girl. - Are you ready to take her? - Yup. - The two of them are just spectacular. - Oh, yeah. You ready? Come on. Attagirl! We love you, Bethany! Phoebe. Thanks. Hey. How you doing? You want your mattress? Here you go. All right. You don't want your mattress? Okay. Gotta go, all right? I'll see you tomorrow. Hey! Winter! What are you doing? What's wrong with her? I don't know. She's acting really strange. Panama is too. She didn't eat her 2 p.m. bucket or her 5. You tell Clay? Yeah. He had a look at her. He's gonna run some more tests tomorrow. Hey, Mom. Hi, hon. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Professor Miguel Arroyo. Hi. Nice to meet you. Come have a seat. Okay. Sawyer, I watched you today with Winter... and everything Kyle tells me seems to be true. You're really good with dolphins. Dr. Arroyo is my advisor at Boston University. He's helping me get into med school. Okay. I'll get right to the point. We have a special program at the university... for marine biology students. It's called Sea Semester. Twelve weeks on a sailing ship. Full learning experience right on the ocean. This semester we're emphasizing marine mammals. Our students get hands-on teaching... from some of the finest scientific minds in the country. Sailing on a tall ship, cruising through the Caribbean... and watching wild dolphins in some of the most beautiful waters on Earth. Every year, we invite one gifted high school student to join us... and this year we'd like that student to be you. It's a challenge. The science is rigorous, but I think you can handle it. And I promise you it'll be an experience you'll never forget. And it's a full scholarship. All paid for. What...? Full academic credit at school. All I have to do is speak to the guidance counselor... and come Fall, if you decide you're in, you'd fly with Kyle to Boston... And we'll take care of the rest. To be honest, your work with Winter is very well known in our field. It would be an honor to have you as our student. The Aquarium is now closed. Please exit the building. We apologize. The aquarium is now closed for the day. We apologize for any inconvenience. I'm so sorry. There's been an emergency. That's really all I can say. - Rebecca! What's going on? - You've gotta go talk to Clay. Sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you for your understanding. I'm sorry. Panama! What happened? We just don't know. She, took one last breath and went to the bottom. Kat was there, but there was nothing she could do. Winter. Winter's fine. We had them separated. We needed Panama alone to do some tests. She was just so old. Could have been anything. Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. Come in. Or up, or whatever. Thanks. How you doing? It's funny. I never come up here anymore. I used to spend hours and hours up here. Why do these things have to happen? Wish I knew. I loved Panama. I'm gonna miss her so much. She was good, you know? She was gentle. Yeah. If you could turn the clock back to whenever you want... and make everything exactly the way it used to be... would you? Maybe. But... I don't really know. Yeah. Come here, Winter. How's our girl? Mostly just staying under the platform. Think she knew Panama was dying? It's hard to say. She may have seen something inside Panama that we couldn't. Who knows? Maybe she was trying to tell us. It's really good that you're keeping her company. What's that? Oh. Yeah, I forgot. Hey, I know this program. It's out of Boston, right? Yeah. They invited me. That's fantastic, buddy! That is a big deal! So when do you go? September something. But it's for three months. Think it's okay for me to leave Winter that long? She'll be fine. We've gotta pair her up with another female, don't we? Yeah. That's true. We've got Mandy now. We do. What do they say? "Whenever one door closes, another one opens." Yeah. So you're saying basically she's depressed? Yeah, in dolphin terms, yes, she's lethargic... not interacting, refusing her food for the most part. We're trying to increase her supplements, but... What about the prosthetic? She's refusing that too. So it's possible her spine is deteriorating again? It's possible. I have an ultrasound and x-ray set scheduled for Friday. It's been, what, three weeks? And you've kept her away from the public the whole time. Yup. I have. Sounds like she's missing Panama. She's probably lonely. And isn't it against USDA regulations to keep a dolphin in a pool alone? We have another female. Why don't we just put Mandy in with her? I can't give you an answer on that right now. But we're more than just a hospital now. We're a full-blown aquarium. People are coming from all over the world to see and learn. - I'm aware of what people... - That allows us... to expand and build more care facilities and pools and operating rooms. And how many of those people have come to see Winter? Clay, come on. You've seen the faces of the kids and the veterans, right? How moved and inspired they are. Isn't that part of our mission too? You can't just throw two dolphins in the water together! It doesn't work that way! I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, Clay. I'm just saying that putting Mandy and Winter together in the pool... as soon as possible would be a heck of a good idea. Don't you think? Come on up! Good girl. Yeah. Good girl. How's Mandy doing? Pretty good. Her sunburn is looking a lot better. Good. - What's with Rufus? - I don't know. He's been doing that for a couple days now, just up and down to that dock over there. Why? I don't know. Maybe he's losing his mind. Heh. Not that there's much to lose. Which dock is it? - What is that? - Is there something under there? I don't know. - What is it? - I have no idea. Oh, my gosh. Here, get its head up! Oh, my gosh. It's all tangled. - Rufus...! - We got him. Rufus...! Rufus, cut it out! What is your issue? Go away! - Well, least she didn't swallow the hook. - Yeah. When these guys throw their old fishing line in the water, they just don't realize. - Ilex, please. - Yeah. The lacerations aren't too bad, I guess. Yeah, but we need x-rays. Make sure nothing's broken. - CT scan? - Yeah, and blood work. Check her glucose. - She's lost blood, her iron will be low. - Absolutely right. - What on earth is wrong with that bird? - Where do I start? Thanks. There she goes. All right. What do you think, guys? What do we name her? Mavis. Mavis? - From The Andy Griffith Show! - Don't you watch any TV from this century? Great. Now he's a bodyguard. Please pardon our clutter. Excuse me, look out! Look out! Excuse me! You can't get in without a ticket. Do you have a ticket? No, I don't have a ticket, nor do I intend to buy one. - You need to buy a ticket. - Stop clawing at me! - I've got jars of peanut butter older than you. - But, sir... Get your grubby hands off my case, piranha! Dr. McCarthy! You can let him in. He's our guest. - Sorry, sir. - All right. I'm sorry. There are so many new people here, they didn't know who you were. That much is obvious. We have a standing appointment, every 6 months. I'm so sorry. It totally slipped my mind. Surely she's outgrown the last tail by now. The trick has been trying to get her to wear it. I'm so sorry, but no one's allowed back here. Winter's not feeling very well. - Why? - I'm sorry, girls. - Does she ever come out? - Not much. Not since Panama died. It's hard to even coax her out to eat. You ever try bacon? - It works with my cat. - Heh. Yep. Thanks. All right. Come on, Winter. Up you go. Don't rush her now. Nice and slow, Sawyer. There you go. Good girl. Come on. It's okay. Here she comes. Come on. Good girl. Good girl. Yeah. Come on. Attagirl. Good girl. We gotta get you out of the pool, all right? Gotta make another cast. You keep getting bigger... so we gotta make a new tail. So you can wear it. When you feel better. She okay? I think so. Okay, here we go. Ready, Hazel? Phoebe? Good girl. Good girl. - It's coming to you, now. - Okay. - Got it? - Got it. It's okay. All right, let me know, Sawyer. Let's go. All right, gang. Coming down. Hey! Easy, easy. It's okay. How's she looking? - Good? - You're doing good. Still good? Come on, it's okay. It's fine. It's okay. You're doing good. - Oh, my gosh, Sawyer! - Winter! - Get him out of there! - Sawyer! Sawyer! Get over here! I've got you. Come here! Are you okay? - I'm fine. - Take a deep breath. You're all right. In very simple terms, I think our mission here at SEA is to... prepare students to learn on their own. Hey, hon. I scooped it for you. I thought that might make it a little easier. Maybe later. Mom. Stop. I'm so sorry, honey. Any idea why Winter might have done it? I don't. She didn't mean to. She just got freaked out. She's a wild animal. Dr. Clay said anything about when you can go back in? Nope. I hate to nag, honey, but Dr. Arroyo needs an answer soon... Mom, I know, okay? When I have an answer, I'll say so. Come on. Stupid... - Hey, Clay. - George. Hope I didn't startle you. Couple of your staff let me in. The place has really grown, hasn't it? Hey, Clay? We need to... Oh. - Phoebe, I think we might be a while. - Right. I was really sorry to hear about your bottlenose, CMA 0219. Yeah, Panama. Yeah. Anything in from the necropsy? Well, she was confirmed at over 40 years old. Pathology points to respiratory failure. That's common at that age. Tell you what though. She lived a good, long life. Yeah. She did. And what about her companion, CMA 1108? Winter. Right. She's, right over there. Hey, Clay? Paint's kind of peeling here. You watch that. You don't want that falling into the pool. Yeah. Behavior's certainly off. I see the blood work shows elevated cortisol levels. Clay, this animal is severely stressed. Yeah. We're doing routine medical work-ups, keeping a 24 hour watch. It's a major violation for her to be isolated like this. You know that. I know. It's temporary though. We have Mandy. 1307A? - Oh, yeah. - She's rehabbing great. And, hoping to get them paired up as soon as possible. When do you think that will be? Don't know. I see. Clay? - I'm gonna be perfectly frank with you. - Please do. I'm gonna write you up for a number of violations. All right. Back-up generator has not been tested in 6 months. Fish freezer, the temperature's a couple degrees too high. Okay. And look after the paint around the pool, will you? Yeah, sure. However, the most egregious violation is your female bottlenose, Winter. She's not doing well, Clay. She's stressed, she's isolated, her scoliosis is getting worse. That animal needs to be paired with another female, and soon. Okay, I know you know that. But it's my job to make it official, right? I'm giving you 30 days to correct the problem. Thanks for the root beer. Hello. What do you think? Ready for a field trip? Mavis Haskett? I hear you're getting your own MRI. - Yeah! - Well, that's exciting, but I'll miss your visits. Okay, Mavis! Say "cheese." Ladies and gentlemen, we have an otter presentation... starting in five minutes by the upstairs pool. That's five minutes. Sawyer? Hey. Sorry to bother you, but that's my grandpa. He's just visiting, and I know no one's supposed to get close to Winter... but I was wondering if there's any chance he could just have a peek? Now, Suze, don't strong-arm the man. I'm not. I'm just asking. If not, we totally understand. I've got an idea. Here, follow me. I'm okay. I'm okay. I've been walking on this thing since before your mom was born. - Over here, guys. - I'm okay. Can you help me with this? - What happened to your hand? - Oh. I fell. See, she's just right over here. Well, would you look at that! Man, there's nothing there. How come she's not wearing her rig? She's been kind of down lately. Hasn't really felt like it. Yeah, we all get that. This is very cool. It's very cool. Hey. Her eyes have really cleared up. Her sunburn's looking a lot better too. That's a healthy-looking animal. She sure is. Okay, guys, I have Mandy's test results here. I wanted to talk to you two about them first before I briefed anybody else. Okay. So... her blood work is all fine. Her gastrics are all fine. X-rays of her lungs, all negative. That's a good thing. There's no sign of infection, so we've discontinued antibiotics. White cell count is normal. And her sunburn is totally healed. That is pretty much a clean bill of health. - Yeah. - That's fantastic. So can we talk about pairing her with Winter because after Winter... Hazel. What I'm saying is that Mandy's fine. Do you hear what I'm saying? Mandy's really fine. And we have an obligation to let every animal... - You can't release her. - How can I not release her? All you have to do is wait six months or a year until we find another female... Six months or 10 years! We don't know what's gonna happen. If Mandy can go home, then she deserves to go home. But we'll lose Winter! We lost Panama. Now we're gonna lose Mandy! Hazel! I get it! This is not all about Winter! If Mandy can catch live fish, and that is the last test... then that's a decision that I will have to make! All right? Hey. Hey. How's Hazel? She's gone to bed. I am not exactly her favorite person right now. Well, what you gonna do? Speaking of which, what are you gonna do? Oh, I don't know. Something tells me you have some fatherly advice all lined up, though. Heh. Oh, I've always got that. In this case, I only got three words. And they're not mine, they're yours. Mine? All the way back when you started this place... you wrote three words on the back of a cocktail napkin at Frenchy's. "Rescue. Rehab. Release." The words you built this place on. You didn't build it to keep animals. You built it to heal them and let them go. Tell me something. Poor Winter can't ever go home. But if she could... - In a heartbeat. - There you go. How am I gonna tell Hazel? Beats me. I got enough trouble trying to figure out how to talk to you. I find myself out of thread here. What you doing? Going for a run. I was thinking maybe we should talk. No, you're thinking you should talk. I should listen. - Come on, Hazel. - I told you, I'm going for a run. Hazel! It's like I'm a plate-glass window. He doesn't even see me. Your dad does have a lot on his mind right now. Yeah, but he doesn't listen to me, he doesn't tell me things. All I'm saying is keep Mandy a few months... just till Winter's settled and we can pair her with another female. But he won't try. It's like he doesn't care about Winter anymore. Hazel, you know that's not true. I'm sorry for just dumping all this on you. I just didn't know who else to talk to. Well, I don't know much about dolphins. I know about hospitals though. - You know what I sometimes think? - What? What if someday I came to work and the place was empty? Just room after room, no patients. Bunch of bored doctors and nurses sitting around because everybody was fine. No need for surgery. No sick people. No one's here because they want to be. They're here because they need to be. And I assure you, no one stays one minute longer than they have to. Talk to your dad. You kids take us by surprise. You grow up so stinking fast. Talk to him the way you want him to talk to you. Do something grown-up. Take him out for coffee. I hate coffee. This is hot chocolate. I was born the year you and mom started the aquarium... so technically I've been here as long as you have. Yeah. That's true. Then it's not right to exclude me from things, because I'm not a child. I'm as capable of making informed decisions as anyone here. Yeah. - You are. - So if we are going to consider Mandy... a candidate for release... I'd like to see her files: medical records, blood works, cytologies. I'd like to read them now, please. Yeah. Okay. Have at it. Could you hand them to me? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. You got it. - How's she doing, Kat? - I think we're good. Okay. All right, Sawyer, get the gate. Hey. Is that them? Yeah. Half-dozen. Okay. That should be fine. Okay. Okay, everyone, don't stand too close. - Everybody ready? - Yup. Of course you have a choice. - I have an obligation to every... - Your obligation is to this institution... and the people and the animals and the work we've done over the last three years. Think about the community! What Winter means to them! I have a job to do, Phil. If you let Mandy go, the government will take Winter, and that is it, end of story. I can't morally keep her in captivity! - So we lose Winter? - We might. When we shook hands on the dock that day you told me I could run this place my way! And that's what I'm doing! If you don't like it, fire me. All right, guys. Keep tension on the ropes, please. Are you guys ready down there? Here we go. As soon as she gets past the ledge, Skip, turn her to your side. - We're gonna take her in tail first, all right? - Keep the rope tight, please. Nice work. Easy, easy. Cammy, Maxie, please go on that side. Easy. Take your time. Watch her fluke. Hold it steady. I figure you've been on enough of these releases. Why don't you take over from here? Are you serious? Yeah. You could do this in your sleep. Just don't. Clay? She's leaning a little. Is that okay? Yeah! Yeah, that's fine, Kat! Just watch her pec on that far side. Tuck it. Okay, got it! Nice job. Lower her to my side as we go up the ramp. Ready? All right. Here we go, guys. What is it? - I just wanted to watch it. - Oh, yeah, me too. So exciting. Radio check? Kyle, do you read me? Kyle? Yeah, I hear you. Sorry, but who is this? Is that you, Phoebe? It's Hazel. It's Hazel. Heh, heh. Hey, Hazel. I'm reading you loud and clear. Hazel! Look! It's Mandy. Ready? One, two, three! - Go slow, slow, slow. - Keep it level. Go slow, go slow. - Dad, lower yours a little bit. - Okay. Phoebe, watch your pole. We're doing good, guys. Just watch your footings. Breath. Nice and steady. Good work, guys. Okay. That's good. Stop here. How's she doing? Looks like she's ready to go. How's the transmitter? All good. We're good here, Kyle. You got a signal? You bet. Signal's nice and strong. Okay. All right, everyone, right side. We're gonna lower our poles on three. Ready? One, two, three! - Got her? - Yeah. All right, left side, on three. Ready? One, two, three! Good. Go on. - Go on, Mandy. - Go, Mandy. Go, Mandy! Yes! There we go! Go, Mandy! Look at that. She's starting to take off. Bye, Mandy! Get home safe! Wow. She is really moving fast! - Yeah. - Hang on. Something's coming. - What do you see? - I don't know. What do you see, Kyle? It's a school of something. Sharks maybe. They're coming at her fast. - They should move in. - No, wait. Dad. Look there! - Dolphins. - Yeah. A whole pod. Kyle, they're bottlenose. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Look, there they are! Look! Everybody, look! They're dolphins! Looks like they're giving her a hero's welcome. Yeah, Mandy! That was nice of you the other day. - What was? - That veteran. Letting him see Winter. Thanks. And that volunteer too. - What's her name again? - Who? The volunteer. Dark hair, this long. Oh. Susie. So you book your flight to Boston yet? No. Well, Kyle did, but... - I don't know... - What don't you know? I don't know if I'm gonna go. What? No, Sawyer, you have to! Why? Why do I have to? - Because it's such a great opportunity... - I know it is! That's all anyone ever says to me anymore! - I'm just happy for you! - I get it! Sorry. Hazel, what am I supposed to do? Mandy's gone, Panama's gone, Winter's getting worse. I'm not even allowed to swim with her any more. How could I leave now? - What are you doing? - This has gone on long enough. You are gonna get in so much trouble! Well, at least we'll know. Come on, Winter. Here she comes. - If she gets aggressive, just get out. - Yeah. No kidding. Talk to her. I've got it. I've known her longer than you have. Yeah, like, 10 minutes. You know what I mean. Don't be so pushy. Hey. Hey, girl. Show her your wrist. Here. See it? It's okay. I'm okay. Good girl. Tweety-bird. Answer her. Everything okay now? We good? Get him, Winter! Come on! - It worked! - Yes! Gotcha! Serves you right! Come on. Good girl. She's a good girl. She's okay. Yeah, she's fine. Hey! What do you think you're doing? - It wasn't his fault, Dad. It was my decision. - No, it wasn't. I don't care whose it was! It was dangerous. These aren't pets. They're wild animals. - I told you specifically... - But you weren't here. I know Winter better than anyone. So we made our own decision. And she's fine. So don't blame Hazel for anything. If you're gonna blame someone, blame me. Oh, guys... It doesn't even matter. George Hatton came by today. Another violation? That's a transfer order. They're moving Winter to a marine park... in Texas. I... I'm so sorry. Hey, Mom. I'm really sorry I'm late. It's okay, honey. I just was seized by this strange craving for the grouper they have next door. What do you say we grab a bite to eat? Yeah. Okay. Good. Not too crowded. How can you tell? It's so dark. Surprise! - Hey. Sawyer! - Hey. Hey, Sawyer. Good to see you. Congratulations, young man. Hey, there he is! Sawyer, man of the hour. Come say hi to everybody. You must be so thrilled. - Yeah. - When do you guys leave? The 23rd. We're on the noon flight out of Tampa. I can't even imagine how excited you must be right now. Yeah? Huh? Right? You must be so happy for him. I am. And such a nice turnout. Shows you how much people love that boy. They do. Oh, Lorraine! Sweetie! - Oh! So sorry. - Oh, that's okay. Goodness. Here, let me help you. - Wow. - Heh. I want him to go. I do. I just... I just don't want him to go. Heh. It's okay. Hey, Reed. Doc, you made it. - Oh, yeah. Never pass up a free meal. - Heh. Where is the guest of honor? Hey. - Hey. - Brought you something. - Going away present. - Thanks. It's an old Chinese custom. Open it. Wow. It's beautiful. Belonged to my Uncle Willy. Been sitting in my garage since the Nixon administration. Well, thank you. Hit it. - What? - Hit it. There it goes. You see the problem? I'm about to get a lesson here, aren't I? The watch is beautiful... but my guess is it sat in that box so long, that it just stopped. You have to shake it up now and then to get it moving forward. Okay. It's a big world, Sawyer. Too many opportunities out there to spend your life in a box. No matter how nice the box is. Thank you. My pleasure. How you feeling, girl? Yeah. Me too. It's Clay Haskett. Who's calling? What? When? Yes! Yes, yes! Absolutely! Excuse me, please. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, guys. I just heard from Clay. It's urgent. He needs us right now. - Hey. What's going on? - Marine Fisheries called. They just picked up a stranding. They're on their way. Gosh. - Let's go! - Abby, get that stuff. - Somebody help me with these! - Yeah, stand them up! - Get these tables in the back! - We'll put her over here! Grab those chairs! Guys, I need three more... Hurry up, people. We don't have a lot of time. - How's it going over there? - Clay, what do you need? I need that water level down to four feet max. We're on it. I need a path cleared here, folks. All of this stuff out of here, right away. Clay! I got him! Steve, what's your ETA? How long? Twenty minutes. What did you say? It's a juvenile male? Clay? It's a female. Well, I certainly wasn't expecting this. Me neither. I'd have worn a nicer tie. All right, everyone. When that truck arrives, you will hear one voice, and it will be mine. Does everyone have their assignments? Okay. Gonna need a stretcher team. Phoebe, I want you at the head with me. - Gonna need some strong backs. - Here's one right here. Great. Get on up here. Sawyer? I want you right beside me. - Yes, sir. - Okay. Gonna need a couple other people as well. I hope this one isn't missing any parts. I mean, if it's lost its head, there's not much I can do. That's them! All right, everyone! Let's get ready to go! Come on! Hey, guys. She's stiffening up. Might not make it. Gotta get her in the water fast! Dad, she's so little. I'm gonna take her myself. Phoebe, clear the way! Get out of the way! Everybody get out of the way! I've gotta see this. - Come on. - Guys, move! Clear the way! Everyone move! Clear! - How we doing over here? - Good. Yeah? Okay, let's get her in the water. Slowly... That's perfect. All right. We're coming down with her. Phoebe, ready? Kat? - Yeah, ready. - All right, Dad. Let me know, guys. How we looking, Kyle? Good? Yeah. It's all you. Let me know. Almost. - All right, that's good. - Cut it! Nice and easy, Phoebe. Keep them even. Okay. Nice and easy. Come here, sweetie. I gotcha. I gotcha. Dad, listen. - Look at that! - Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. She's precious. For crying out loud. I've pulled anchovies off of pizzas that were bigger than that. Hey, everyone. Great hustle. Really good work. I'm so proud of everyone. That's fantastic. Great job, guys. Really good. Now all we can do is hope. That's her name. What do you think? Yeah. Everyone... let's say hello to Hope! Hello, Hope. - Hi, Hope. - Come here, little girl. Come here. Yeah. Look at little Hope. Well, good morning, Tampa. It's August 25th, the dog days of summer. - To start us off this morning... - Hurry up! It's on! ...it's been a very busy few weeks at our own Clearwater Marine Aquarium... hasn't it, Jenny? That's right, Mel. It started three weeks ago, when a little stranded dolphin... named Hope was rescued and brought to CMA. But because she is too young... to have learned from her mom how to survive in the wild... she'll never be able to be released. Yeah. I understand, George, but I'm gonna need some time. Can you give me an extension? Yes, of course. I will put it in writing. She might be a Godsend to CMA's most famous... I will put it in writing right now. ...resident, Winter, who recently lost her companion, Panama, to old age. She's been lonely ever since, so it's hoped that Hope may provide the answer. Oh. That's adorable! It's her favorite thing! She loves it! That is so cute! But there is even more going on at CMA. Just this morning they released a green sea turtle back into the wild. Mavis was found wrapped up in fishing line. But once her flippers healed, she was good to go. Whoa! Look out! Wild bird! I know! This pelican wanted in on the action. Boy, that is one feisty pelican! You're telling me? Rufus! No! Go away! Stop it! - Go away! - All right. Here's good. - Hazel, will you get him, please? - I will. Okay, easy, easy. Okay. Whoa. Okay. I've got him! Just go! - No. Sorry. - All right. Are we good? No! Don't do it! Okay, there you go. Rufus, come on. No! I got him! Just go! - Mavis! - Go, Mavis! Go, Mavis! Go, Mavis! No! Nope! Come on! Stay back! Shoo! No! No, you don't! No! Come on! Go, Mavis! Bye! - Wow, she's really going! - Oh, yeah. Go, Mavis! No, no, no! Hey! Rufus! Rufus! Crazy bird. What's he doing? No! Rufus! Yes, Fire and Rescue. We're gonna need everything fully equipped. EMT's, backboards, ambulances, the whole nine yards. Is there any way we can get the same guys we worked with in the past? Gastrics are good. The animals are healthy. Of course we're ready, George. 8 a.m. Saturday. Can I come in? Yeah. You know tomorrow's end of the month. Yeah, I know. Dr. Arroyo needs an answer. - He does. And the longer you wait... - Mom, I don't know. How can I tell him anything if I don't know what's gonna happen with Winter? They can't hold your place forever. Honey, sometimes in life, we just have to make a decision. Okay. I get it. Well, tomorrow is a big day. We'll see what happens. I love you. I know. I love you too. - Off? - Yeah. Thank you. Remember, today needs to feel just like a normal day. They'll have their sessions. Kat will have Hope. Sawyer will have Winter. Everybody knows their assignments? Gate minders? - Kyle, where are you? - Back here. Kyle is our safety. If anybody feels like they are in trouble... his word is law. Okay? Sawyer. Okay. First of all, I want to thank everyone for their hard work... and preparation for this moment. You guys are fantastic. Thank you. Yes. But remember... no matter how much we love Hope and Winter, they are wild animals. They can bite or rake each other with their teeth, and even draw blood. Or head-butt. Take a cheap shot when the other one's not looking. That's how they establish dominance in the wild. It's natural, but it can be rough. Reed, Rebecca, Jeanette, you guys have the net, right? Yeah. If they go after each other... you divers look for Phoebe's signal to get the net between them fast. But if it all goes well, and they accept each other, you'll see this: Parallel swimming and easy, natural, relaxed behavior. But anything else... Anything that looks aggressive... safety first. Theirs and ours. All right. Any questions? Yeah. Yeah. Dr. Clay. When did you get so bossy? You guys get the net. - Remember, stay calm. - Got it. Let's move this. Put it in the back. - All set here? - Yeah. Sorry. Good luck today. Thanks. - You ready? - Yeah. Morning, morning, good morning. It's nice to meet you. - Reed. Kyle. - Hey. - Morning, Mr. Hordern. - Ready to do this? - Yes, sir. - Hope it goes well. Hope so. Sawyer? Are you ready to go? You ready? All right. All right. Here we go. We got this. Is everybody set? We're good to go, Phoebe. Okay. Open the gate. Okay, Kat. Go ahead and release Hope. - Clay, I don't like this. - Just give it a second. Hang on. - Hope! - Hope! Hope! - Get the net! - No! Winter! Wait, wait, wait! Hold up! Close the gate! Oh, my gosh! I hope they're all right. Is everybody all right? - At first Winter was fine. - Holding in the gate. She's just being territorial. She's saying, "it's my gate." There. Freeze it. - Look. - She's echolocating. - Yeah, and she sees Winter has no tail. - She doesn't like that. Here, then look. - See when Winter starts swimming? - It freaked Hope out. Which then freaked Winter out. Because that movement's completely unnatural. Hope doesn't understand that. Yeah, but there's nothing we can do about that. That's the only way she can swim. Maybe not. What if she wore the tail? That would freak Hope out even more. But at least she'd have a more natural swimming motion. She has never seen anything like it! It's just a huge contraption. But it's that up and down motion. Yeah, but if she smacks Hope with it, it's game over. - Hope is so little. - She hurt Sawyer. It's too dangerous. Hang on a second, guys. Sawyer... I want to know what you think. She's been aggressive before, right? Think she'll do it again? No. No, that was my fault. I pushed her too fast, she wasn't ready. And I know Winter. And she's fine now. I can see it. I can see it in her eyes, and the way she is with me. She's like how she always was. She never meant any harm. And if we don't give her this chance, what do we do? Give up? I don't want to look back on this knowing we didn't even try. Sawyer's right. Okay. Tomorrow, 8 a.m. With the tail. Anybody has a problem with that, speak up now. - Looks pretty busy. - Holy smoke! What on earth is the news doing here? I have no idea. Do you think they all heard about the pairing? Sawyer! We heard you're trying to pair Winter and Hope! Will you comment on it? You get inside. I'll take care of this. - What about Winter? - We heard they're moving Winter. We heard Winter's moving to Texas. Is that true? Let him get to work. I know you have a lot of questions... Kyle, can you give us any information? When we have a statement ready... - Get your Hope and Winter T-shirt! - Can I get a T-shirt? Hello, Sawyer! Sawyer! Sawyer! Okay, everybody, remember this is just a normal day. Here we are. Cool. It's a whole new design. Yeah, more streamlined. I finished it about 4:00 this morning. The joints are carbon fiber, and I made the flukes a little darker... so it's easier to track movement. And I hope you'll notice that they're a lot floppier. - More like the real thing? - Yeah. How did you get these edges so soft? Three jars of meat tenderizer and a baseball bat. Is this a new formula, too? No, kid. Same formula. I just made a fresh one. Don't get greedy. All right. Yeah, they are. We're still here. It's been about an hour. We haven't heard anything in the aquarium for a while. It's been pretty hush-hush around here. Thanks. Sawyer, you wanna show it to her? Yeah. She's okay. It's okay. But you gotta wear it now. It's the most important time ever. Dr. McCarthy made it special, just for today. See? There he is. He stayed up all night making it for you. My sentiments exactly. Miss Hamilton. Phil Hordern. It's an honor to have you here. Thank you for having me. Clay? - It's on. - Attagirl. All right, Kat, ready? Yep. Dad? - Ready. - Yeah. Let's go. All right. Let's get her off the platform. All right. Up and down, Winter. Come on. I think she likes it. Good girl. You hear that? That's Winter. Couple of chicks talking trash over the fence. All right. Anybody's not ready, I want you to speak now. All right, Kat, Sawyer... be ready to pick them up fast at my command, okay? I hope they like each other. Me too. All right. Open the gate. Here we go. Kat, send Hope. Go on. Stand-off. Showdown at high noon. - Clay? - Hang on. Get ready with the net. Wait on the net! Wait! Let them go. What are they doing? Nobody move. Nobody move! Here they come! They're accepting. They're accepting! Yes! Well, I'll be darned. It's working! We did it! They did it! It Worked! Way to go! I love that fish! She's not a fish! Looks like a fish, smells like a fish. Way to go, Clay. You did it again. Look, Dad, they're playing! - Can I see that for a minute? Yep. - Thanks. Whoa! Kyle...! I gotta go, Winter. Okay? I'll come back. I promise. We don't know for sure if dolphins feel emotion the way we do... fear, joy, sadness... but it feels like they do. They may even feel things like loneliness, friendship, or loss. It's hard to say. I'd like to think that instinctively they understand... that life has all of that in it. And that's not a bad thing. We just have to embrace it. Sawyer! I'm on the roof! Up here! - Hey, Mom. Can you pull over for a sec? - LORRAINE: Sawyer! Up here! - Sawyer! - Is that Hazel? Yeah. - Oh! - What was that? Rufus! You're back! Oh, Rufus. Because when one door closes, another opens. Life is always full of possibilities. Bye, Sawyer. Really gonna miss you. Lift your weight. Don't let the other guy lift your weight. There we go. Get that stretcher up here, that blue stretcher. I want her flipped around. Name is Hope.
