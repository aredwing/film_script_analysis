Coming up right after the news, we got a dedication going out... ... to all you guys pulling guard duty tonight at Quan Loi. A little something to keep you awake. We'll be back with more music in a minute. This is Channel 54, Saigon. Time at the automatic tone, The landing zone occupied by elements... ... of the 1st Infantry Division at Quan Loi... ... 65 miles north of Saigon... ... received about five rounds of 107 mm rocket fire. And an element of... And we're back with the hits on AFVN, Channel 54, Saigon. This is Army Specialist First Class Doug Ledhart with the music tonight... ... and here's Wilson Pickett with "Funky Broadway." Criminal Investigations Detachment. This is it. This is my life. The path of my life has led me to be a fucking cop... ...in the fucking cesspool of the world. I'd say we just give up on the motherfucker. This man's service record says he's a tunnel rat. For nine months I've wanted to meet a rat. Well, I hope you meet one. - What's the next name on the list? - Just head over to the Moo-Lon. I gotta meet my rat. Yeah, yeah. This guy here? Yeah, this dude dinky dau number 10. Crazy motherfuck. - He was here? - Yeah. One hour. Crazy motherfuck. Buy cigarette from Plowboy. Smoking and smoking it. Fall down. Get up. Leave. There. There's Plowboy. The fucker can run. Out! No fucking shit. Motherfucker. Cut him off! Slow down, you little fuck! Stand tall, you little fuck! Why you chase? I don't know why you deal drugs, Plowboy. You could have made this shithole's Olympic team... ...won some medals and retired to a palace somewhere. I no deal. Plowboy farmer. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Must be a fucking pill farmer. This man. Where is he? - I don't know. Never see. - "Never see"? You're full of shit. - I'm gonna pull your fucking nuts off. - Hey, easy, Babe. - Easy? He pull a gun on you? - Yeah. - He could've shot you. - Yeah. Stand the motherfuck up. Let me go. - I'm taking them off. - Hey, hey, easy, Babe. Remember the last time you did that to a national? All those reports? - It ain't worth the paperwork. - I don't give a shit about paperwork. I want them nuts. I'm gonna throw them in the fucking sewer. Think about it. Here I come. I'm gonna take them... I can't control him, Plowboy. You better talk to me. You better talk to me. Now, do it, Baby. That's it! Shit. We got mice. The meeting of hearts and minds continues, I see. Don't give me any shit, Lime. He pulled a gun on me. Vietnamese nationals are outside your jurisdiction. Well, we're looking for a deserter who is in our jurisdiction... ...and your cousin here sold him a laced stick about an hour ago... ...and might know where he is. Pull his fucking nuts off. Maybe I should file a protest to the commanding officer. So you can spend the rest of the tours in the Long Binh stockade. We gotta talk to him, Lime. You're welcome to observe if you like. You allow me that right? How conveniently you Americans forget that Vietnam is not your colony. He's at the Kit Kat Club. Lime, if I was a different kind of guy... ...I'd ask you to marry me. I simply can't wait. A- Spot 1, this is Landlord. A- Spot 1, over. - Where you guys been? Top wants you over at an apartment on Vam Co Dong and Minh Streets. No can do, Landlord. We're heading over to the Kit Kat to pop a deserter... ...we've been after for three days. Send somebody else. Top just got off the horn with the mice and he sounded pissed. Oh, shit. Shh, shh, shh. Yeah, come here. Come on. It didn't take you too long. Where you been, pissing off more MPs? You heard about that, huh? You two can be a couple of real jerk-offs, you know that? I mean, tact. - Who's your friend? - Oh, it's a dead woman's kid. Go away. You're fucked up, man. - Get the fuck out of my way. What you doing? You'll be seeing me, motherfucker. Hey, why so glum, Al? Hey, Top, don't call me Al. My mama named me Albaby. A- L-B-A-B-Y. In respect to her, please. Looks like a Vietnamese problem. What are we doing here? Yeah, it was, until somebody found this. Oh, great. American. Officer. Found it in her hand. She's a hooker. .45, the back of the head and bang-o. Anything else? Not much. Her name was "Nguyen Tao Giap." Apparently she's new to the area. Nobody in the building knows her. Hey, Top. Let me do that. Let me do that because I got 13 brothers and sisters. Yeah. A neighbor woman here heard the shot. She's got something to say. - Where's she now? - Talking to the mice. Oh, Colonel Kitts says to coordinate our investigation with theirs, by the way. In the interest of better ally relations. Who's heading up the investigation for the mice? Looks like the American's capacity to enjoy himself has gotten excessive again. - Nothing's been established yet, Lime. It will be. I'm sure you'll do everything to prove it's not an American who did this. - You're really starting to pain me, Lime. - Oh, excusez-moi. Lime Green. Ain't that the color of puke? Sergeant. The neighbor's ready for questioning. Appears she was with a black GI who went next door when he heard the shot. He didn't come back, but a couple minutes later... ...she saw him leave the building following somebody. She thinks it was the killer. Ask her if she knows the GI's name or his unit. Drippy dick. No name, no unit, nothing. He was only with her for a couple minutes. Her short-arm inspection revealed he had the clap. Drippy dick. Yeah, she says he had a real dose. Tell her to meet me at VD Control tomorrow at noon. No. Me got no VD. I'm very clean. I'm number one blowjob girl. Xin loi, miss. I'm sure you're as clean as a whistle. Just tell her to meet me. And, Rogers, no freebies, okay? Do you know this girl? Do you know this girl? Have you seen this girl? Do you know this...? Oh, fuck it. Yeah, right. Nobody knows a thing. But somebody's got some American scrip in their pocket. I'll tell you something, man. Bullshit and science rule the world. Where did she come from? Dubuque. Stockholm. She ain't from here. You know, that insignia could be total bullshit. Yeah. You know who our suspects are? - Everybody in Saigon. - Civilians, troops, gangsters, cowboys... ...deserters, refugees, dopers, black-marketeers. God... ...I love this town. I really do. I'm starting to wonder about you, my man. My name is Agent Perkins. This here's my partner, Agent McGriff. Now, you men are here... ...for two reasons. One, is because you're black, which there ain't no question about. And two... ...is because you've all recently been treated for drippy dick. Dick just dripping. Shit, I can hear your dicks dripping. How does it feel? Black in Nam. Fucking dick feels like it's about to drop off. Boy, y'all some sorry motherfuckers. We have reason to believe that one of you... One of you... ...was in the off-limits soul-kitchen section... ...of Vam Co Dong Street last night when a shooting occurred. Now, one of you was there. We'd like to talk to you about what you may have seen or heard. No volunteers? All right. Stand up and line up against that motherfucking wall back there. - Get on up. - I'll get the girl. Drippy dick. Shit. I don't know why the bitch is telling fibs. She ain't got no reason to tell fibs. Bullshit. I been there all night fucking that bitch. She should be grateful, all that love. How many times did you fuck her, Maurice? Eight, 10 times. I'm a ho-taming motherfucker. That bitch won't work for a week at least. Bullshit. She don't have the clap, Maurice, and you can't piss without a painkiller. I'm gonna put your ass in LBJ. I'm sick of this shit. Hey, then be sick of it, motherfucker. The only thing I saw last night was some slant-eyed pussy. Okay. All aright, all right, all right. Calm down. Let me talk to Maurice here. Oh, shit. What you want, Rochester? I don't wanna be Rochester. Maurice, you seem to be overlooking what fine shape you're in here. You think I ain't hip to that? I got my own plan for working this. Yeah? What plan is that? I'm working on it. And no way does it involve you two low-rank bohunk motherfuckers. Who does it involve, Maurice? A general. A general. I want a dude with some jizz to shelter my ass. I wanna see a dude with some jizz to cut me orders out of here. Now, you want a piece of this? You fetch my ass a general. How are we gonna get you a general... ...if we don't know what you have to tell him? I followed the dude that wasted the bitch. Now, I know what he looks like. I know what's his rank and I know where's his billet. But we talking here, high-ranking scrambled eggs motherfucker. I know not to mess with no dude with that kind of juice. Not in this man's army. So if you motherfuckers want a piece of this... ...fetch me a dude with stars on his shirt. Was the man you followed an Army officer? General Reynolds is in Da Nang until Monday. Hey, that's cool. That's cool. I'll wait. But I ain't going back to my unit. How's that? I want a weapon... ...and I wanna stay in a safe house, off-campus. Somewhere downtown in the soul kitchen. I don't trust no motherfuckers at this point. Now, don't give me what I want... ...and I'll get total motherfucking amnesia, dig? I seen that shit on Mod Squad, understand? You get that shit and you don't remember nothing. Those are my terms. Nonnegotiable, power to the people. Fuck the people. Power to Maurice. I'm not staying with the fool because I'll wind up killing him. - Mr. Rogers. - Mr. Rogers. Hey, man. Why don't we get us some dope delivered up here? Man, you nervous enough without that stuff. Then let's get some bitches up here and have a party. I doubt the VD Control would approve you, Maurice. Shit. You know, you sure is one square motherfucker. McGriff and Perkins gonna drop off some food for us in a little while. Maybe they'll party with you. Yeah, right. Those two bohunk motherfuckers. Hey. Now, that's happening. Hi, everybody. I'm Archie Bell with the Drells of Houston, Texas. - We don 't only sing... Oh, watch this shit here. ... we dance just as good as we walk. In Houston, we just started a new dance called the Tighten Up. This is the mu... They're coming to waste my ass. Man, would you put that thing away? The power goes out all the time down here. Come on, motherfuckers. Come on and get me. Phone's dead too. I can't take this spook house shit at all. Shh! Be quiet. Sergeant McGriff? Perkins? Biggest fucking game of the year, Alcindor versus Hayes... ...and I can't get it on AFVN. Holy shit. - Are you all right, man? - Yeah. - Oh, shit. I think it was the sappers. They sprayed us with... Hold it right there, motherfucker. - Sure you're all right? - Yeah. Go ahead. Just call the medics, man. I'm all right. Do you see him? I can't tell. Are they up there? - Which way? Which way, goddamn it? - I don't know. There they are. Hit it. Hit it. Look out! Get out of the way! - Don't do it! Cocksuckers! Goddamn insect motherfuckers. Shit. Okay, slight disorientation here. Just have him go inside and if he needs an analgesic, give it to him. But if not, keep him off morphine. This guy goes to OR 1. What's the status in OR 1? - How's he doing? - They won't let you in there. Some VC asshole threw a satchel bomb in a movie theater up in Chau Long. - They're kind of busy. - We shouldn't have left him. Concussion wound. You couldn't have known. I'm gonna go see how he's doing. What a fucking mess. You, out of here. - Yeah, yeah. He okay? Did you get a look at his assailants? Did you get to look at them? Yeah. They were slopes. Gooks. Little tiny slant-eyed VC motherfuckers with Hawaiian shirts. Somehow I find it hard to feel sorry for you losing one friend... ...when hundreds of Vietnamese are dying each day. But then I suppose American is a study in self-possession. I should remember that. I could pop your head like a pimple before they get off a single round. McGriff. You guys, get out. Your passion is misdirected, sergeant. The men who killed your friend work for the same people you do. That's an order. I found out what that was all about in there. Lime says CID had this case before and suddenly dropped it. He says there's been six of these murders... ...and there's someone high up on our side covering them up. Man, that is such bullshit. You know, that's typical South Vietnamese paranoid bullshit. If there was an investigation before... ...it would've been in our files and it wasn't. Well, he also said those two guys you chased were not VC. He says they're working for the same folks we're working for. That's crazy. Rogers gets put in for a Purple Heart just like everybody else in there. Go home and get some rest. Both of you. Hey. I'm glad it didn't get any worse in there. I'm not. We'd have done all right. Right back to square fucking one. Hey, you. Dead girl baby no mine. You take orphanage. Take Sacr Coeur. - No mine. Fuck you. - Hey. Hey. Lady. Goddamn it. Go away! Lady, let me in. I live in a fucking billet. - Shut the fuck up. It ain't funny. - It ain't? You probably got 10 kids of your own scattered all everywhere... ...and now you finally got one you got to take care of. Just drive to the orphanage, will you? - Oh! Ah! - I was hoping that would happen. I believe this one participated in our night-care program. Night care, Mother? Sister Nicole initiated a program to take care of prostitutes' children... ...while their mothers were at work. Before that, the work was sometimes performed... ...with the child sleeping in the very next bed. I see. These murders, they've become almost epidemic. Mother... ...we're kind of new on this case. How many murders do you know of? Six or seven. Perhaps more. Did you know this child's mother personally? No. Sister Nicole may have. She does social work with many of the prostitutes and bar girls. Could we speak with Sister Nicole? If we can find her. She's always so busy. These are the six victims we are aware of. Sergeant? It's just you look different in your uniform, Sister. I find that wearing my habit can be quite off-putting to people. Sometimes I don't wear it when I work in the community. The common link you are looking for is obvious even in these photographs. The murdered women's children were all Amerasian. The mothers worked in the officers' bars mostly, where the money is highest. This is Dang Kao Lanh. She was killed almost a year ago. Her speciality was sadomasochism. Bondage. This is Nguyen Chi Diem. She specialized in oral sex. The men at the American officers' club would line up for her. Ngo Van Dinh and her little boy. December. She worked for a pimp who put her in the lesbian shows... ...on Vam Co Dong Street... ...and he cheated her every day. Sergeant? You're very worldly for a nun, Sister. I'm trying to help you as much as I can, sergeant. I was very close to some of these women. I want to see the killing stopped. Jesus Christ, officer. Now, what the fuck are we meeting here for? The dead girl had a picture of herself taken in front of this place. Where have you been? It's almost midnight. I had to go to USARV HQ. Just got back. Look. Victims. Not one, but seven. I guess our pal Lime was at least half right. This shit's been going on for over a year now. All the victims are between 17 and 22. And all of them have babies by American daddies. I know. Lime may be all the way right. CID did have this case before. We dropped it six months ago. Bang. Like that. Hey, let's get out of here. Who's he? Colonel Kitts. Recognize the name? You work for him. Being almost 12:00... ...I like everybody join in welcoming Vietnamese New Year. Also welcome Tet cease-fire... ...and offer good will, all men. All men except Charlie. Five, four, three... - Goddamn officer class. ...two, one. Wouldn't surprise me if any one of these pricks is a fucking girl-killer. They say the investigator that was on it was one of our Marine cousins. He was transferred out and that was the end of it. What do you know? Goddamn fireworks. Didn't anybody ask any questions? No. Hey, so there are a few dead whores. Haven't you seen a suspect village after an air strike? Men, women, kids. Shit. Hey, we're in a war zone, girls. Is the other agent still in country? Yes, with the 26 Marine, Jesus Christ. They transferred him to that shithole. Weirder. He's up there at this own request. What's his story? His name's Flowers. Staff Sergeant Elgin Flowers. Hey, that's all I know. - We gotta talk to this guy. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Khe Sanh. Get your asses shot off. Hey, Top, it's Tet. We got a cease-fire. Don't worry about it. Get down! Incoming! Keep it low! Keep it low! - Cease-fire? This ain't no fucking cease-fire! Goddamn! Oh, shit! Damn. Jesus fucking Christ. Bullshit. Motherfucker, you knock over my chow, I knock over your life. - Man, fuck you. Shit. Son of a bitch. Why don't you save that animosity for Charles out there? We're looking for Staff Sergeant Elgin Flowers. Flowers? He's supposed to be in this bunker. Now, what you wanna see Mr. Flowers for? Flowers' mama don't even wanna see him. Where's Flowers? Lieutenant let Flowers dig his own house. You keep going until you get to the end of this here trench line. Flowers' house is maybe 20 meters beyond that. Hey, y'all can't miss it. Flowers got his mojo working there. Yeah, get that voodoo shit working. It's on a stick. Close the door, motherfucker. Hey, fuck you, asshole. Fuck. Come on. Move a little faster, baby? Relax. We got a cease-fire, remember? Who the fuck goes there? Joint services, CID, Saigon. - You here to waste me? Ease up. Nobody here to waste you. Flowers. We only wanna talk. Everything's going along fine... ...until I get it narrowed down to like five suspects. Then my life starts getting bi-fucking-zarre. These five suspects, were they officers? I'm off the case. Go read the files. There ain't no files. Somebody took them. Fellas... ...why don't you build yourselves some nice little trenches out here... ...like me? Life becomes so simple. Just you... ...and the fucking war. Goddamn it, Flowers. No one from channels knows we're up here. Just tell us what you know and we'll leave. Go away. I got work to do. Fuck this. This is not gonna happen. I'm gonna find us a hooch to sleep in. Kiss my ass, huh? These are pictures of the dead women's kids. They're just regular kids... ...but now they're alone in the middle of this mess. I'm alone in the middle of it too, aren't I? Flowers... ...we need your help. Fuck them. Jim, are you okay? - You over there? Yeah, I'm fine. Not much incoming. Wait till the plane gets here. There's our bird. Oh, God, help me, please. Oh, Father. - It's Flowers. Give me your hand. Hey, asshole! - Hey! Hey! - Come on, man. Come on, you can make it! Come on! - Come on! - Fuck you! You're guilt-trip assholes! Guilt-trip motherfuckers! Fuck you! Fuck you, assholes! These are his suspects. Five of these motherfuckers. Ooh. It's the fucking boss man. Surprised nobody's fragged his ass by now. Who the fuck is she? A victim that got away. Her name is Nguyen Tri Quan. Jesus Christ. He had an eyewitness? Then how come there's still five suspects? Well, she ran off before he could show her these pictures. These are the only colonels who were in town on the nights of the murders. Good work. I'll mention your names when it goes upstairs. - Wait. What do you mean, "upstairs"? Now, this ain't a thing for you. - This is an officer thing. - It always was an officer thing. Not a colonel officer thing. You realize how much punch these cocksuckers have in a war zone? Yeah. Like goddamn royalty. And we gonna throw one of them in jail. You work for me? - Sir? Do you work for me? Yes, sir. Get a haircut, son. You're not in the field. You're in Saigon. Let's get some air. Gook whores. I mean, you don't really give that big a shit. Come on, Top. We may have lost a man over this. Besides, it happened on our beat. Your beat? Your beat? You're floating in a big sea of shit. And instead of just staying in the boat... ...no, you reach out and you pick up this one little turd and you say: "This turd? Well, this turd pisses me off. I'm gonna do something about this turd." Christ. - Been here too fucking long. - Oh, fuck it. All right, I've made my speech. If you're gonna pursue this... ...you better do it smart. No more reports. You send nothing through channels till you get this fucker cold. Who hates typing more than we do? You guys... ...a couple of real fucking Gary Coopers, huh? Just don't come crying to me when this turns to shit. And it could, believe you me. Yes, Nguyen has an infant child here... ...but we haven't seen her for several months. No one has. She just disappeared? Does she have any family or friends that might know where she went? She has a sister, Lanh. She works at the stripping place on the corner of Thieu and Tu Do Streets. The Pink Pu... The Pink Pussy, sergeant. We know it well. Thank you, Sister. We'll talk to Lanh and see what she knows. Sergeant. I don't think Lanh will talk to you. She's quite political. She doesn't like Americans. Is she VC? She's political. I'd be happy to talk to her if you'd like. I think we'd better question Lanh ourselves. But maybe you could come with us, smooth things over. I would have to ask mother superior. No, sergeant. We always travel in pairs, like you. So who gets the pretty one on this here double date? That's Lanh on the stage now. I figured we could wait backstage. No, no, a table will be fine. Yeah, that will be fine. Are you uncomfortable, sergeant? You're a nun, Sister. Do you think we could do this work if something like this shocked us? I guess not. I do not talk Gls. Gls kill my brothers. They make fuck-things of my sisters. They have big party in Vietnam. Lanh, I know about a half a million Gls... ...who would just as soon quit the party and go home, believe me. Lanh, if these men can talk to Nguyen... ...they feel they can arrest the man who's killing the girls. Will you help them? Nguyen leave when colonel tries kill. She changed. She no more want to be fuck-thing. She became a patriot now. Hey, miss, we don't give a shit what your sister's politics are. You know, we're just trying to conduct a murder investigation. Hanoi. You look Hanoi for Nguyen... ...if you can get airplanes stop bombing long enough. Thank you, Sister. I'm sorry we were not of more help. So, now, you're a novice. When do you become a full-fledged nun? - I take my final vows in two weeks. - I see. I do intend to take them, Sergeant McGriff. Of course. I was just curious. I should go. Perhaps there are others I can ask about Nguyen's whereabouts. Sister, this is my card. If anything comes up... ...please call. I would like to apologize for something. I enjoyed making you uncomfortable in that club. Some part of me did it on purpose. I'm not sure why. It's okay. ... the UCLA bench. Warren, around the left side. Lucius Allen can 't shoot. Feeds it back to Mike Warren. Warren to the right of the key. That 1-3- 1 zone being used by Houston, and Elvin Hayes is playing the big man. Outside shot, Lucius. Good. - Go. Beautiful. Cool. - Eighteen-footer, hammered her. I've seen him do it 100 times, the big man. He heads towards the hoop... ...as he's going up, he feeds off to Allen, two points. Beautiful. Oh, I'm so happy. - Yeah. You got a crush. - No. Hey, man, this is me you're talking to. I see the way you watch her. You got a crush. I think one of the sappers who wasted Rogers is following us. Nice day for a walk. You know, we gotta take this little motherfucker alive. Stand tall, you little fuck. - Drop the weapon, asshole. No! Drop the gun, you... Who do you work for, pal? Speak to me. I think we should pull his fucking nuts off. - You better go on home, boy. - Fuck you, America! You're lucky that didn't hit me in the foot. I'll come back here and fuck you up. Where's he coming from? You see him? Where is he? I think he's up here. I thought I saw him up here. Forget it! We better call for a backup. Come on. No shit. Back off. Move out of the way! Put that stick down. Get in the car. We gotta get out of here. Get off the car! Fuck you. - Put that fucking rock down. Put the rock down! Get in the fucking car! Fuck you. Fuck you. I'm gonna pop you. I'm gonna pop you. You've finally succeeded in killing a Vietnamese national, I see. No, Lime, that's not what happened. He's lying in the street. His poor mother is weeping over him. Did he commit suicide? Disperse the pissants and then we'll talk. I'm placing you both under arrest. Get out of the car with your hands up. We didn't do it, Lime. We won't leave the car until the natives are back in their grass huts. Hand over your weapons and get out of the car. Now. You wanna give him the satisfaction? Rather die. - May have to. - I said, I'd rather die. We won't leave unless we go as brother cops. No cuffs, no arrest. You shake our hands, we get out of the car... ...you congratulate us and tell us we're cool. We arrested one of the cowboys who wasted Rogers. Someone popped him as we were trying to load him into the car. Yeah, so now Napoleon here wants to arrest us... ...just so he can impress his fans around here. We have an angry crowd here, sergeant. The dead man apparently lived in the neighborhood. I don't give a shit if he lived at the Presidential Palace. My men are coming with me. I'm afraid this crowd won't allow it, sergeant. Fuck the crowd. Let's go. I'm afraid me and my friends won't allow it either. Our credibility is very much at stake here today. Fuck your credibility. You're outgunned today, sergeant. Goddamn, when will you people learn? We're never outgunned. Give me the Air Con frequency. Clipper Ship 3, this is Paste Pot 1, over. This is Clipper Ship 3. Go. Roger that. You see the guy standing next to me in that lime green ascot? Yep. Put the blade at M60 right over his heart. Hold it there. Roger, 1. I'm on target, coming up. We'd love to rock 'n ' roll. You despise me because you think I am corrupt. In reality, you're too innocent to see corruption right before your eyes. Your only real danger lies from those above you. Yeah! Yeah! It's the record jackets on the suspect colonels. Where did you score this shit, Dix? A real top buddy of mine down at USARV. You can count two of those guys out, by the way. How's that? There was only three in town on the day of the last murder. Which three? Well, Kitts, the guy you work for, Scott, guy in your hand... ...and this sweetheart here. Look at the mug on him. Fucking guilty. Guilty. Citadel, West Point... ...commendations, future fucking joint chief. Yeah. Not only is he one of the youngest full birds in any branch... Total animal. - But he's married to a Vietnamese woman... ...and he had a child by her a couple years ago. Now, the wife and kid were killed in a mortar attack out near Can Tho. That's about 13 months ago. Just about the time the murders started. Sounds just about twisted enough to be right, doesn't it? He'll be in town next Thursday morning, by the way. Brass got him talking in the 5:00 follies. We're gonna be on your ass like stink on shit, motherfucker. Gentlemen, Colonel Dexter Armstrong... ...chief of staff, 13th Infantry Division. Presently stationed at firebase Conrad near Can Tho. Good morning, gentlemen. I'm here to dispel some of the gloom and doom... ...running rampant in the press since the beginning of Charlie's Tet Offensive. I work down near Can Tho and I can tell you, personally... ...a lot of what I've been reading is plain bullshit. Take a look at the map. All right, my backyard starts about here... ...runs here across here approximately up to here. And in my backyard, we run the show both day and night. Where I was raised, we used to say: "Never write a check with your mouth you can't cash with your ass." So if any of you don't buy what I just said... ...come on down, take a look for yourself. I'm telling you, I could be in love with this woman. Where does she come from? From God. She a tea girl? Yeah, I met her at the Memphis Pride. This woman had the biggest tits and nipples... ...that I have ever had in my mouth. You gonna eat that shit? No, I'm gonna fuck it. There's our boy. Looks like my man got his ass a little twinight double header. Check it out. Let's get on it. Francine, come on. Come on. Come on. I'm gonna go up the other end and work my way back. Are you frightened, Francine? No sounds, Francine. Well, well, well. Got us a peeping Tom here, Mackey. You get an eyeful, motherfucker? McGriff, CID. - I understand you wanna talk to me. - Yes, sir. But first I'd like to know who gave these men orders to bring us here. These men are my children. They'd open you up and eat your liver if I told them to. I'm their CO and they love me. Uncuff them. Put them in. Fire it up, son. Sir, we're conducting a murder investigation. Saigon prostitutes. Six of them. - You're a suspect, sir. - I know. I'm also busy. - Lift off. Okay, sir. So you think I'm a goddamn murderer. We're just trying to conduct an investigation. Oh, shut the fuck up. I'm conducting something of an investigation here myself. These VC assholes have information I need. I'll interrogate them as you interrogate me. Me them, you me. Got that? - Colonel, I... Shut the fuck up. Bring me a gook. That down here is goddamn Vietnam. No! Start asking your questions. - Sir, don't you think...? - Start now. Where were you on the night of January 28th of this year? City of Saigon, Republic of South Vietnam. Ask him where the supply dump for the 58th NVA Division's located. Interrogate me. Don't stop. What were your exact whereabouts... ...in Saigon at approximately ...on January 28th? Tell him I'll throw his ass out, he doesn't talk to me. I was with my little fuck-bitch at the Continental Hotel. We do a sadist trip together with the little girls. My little fuck-bitch gets off better than I do. Unlatch his hands. Tell him if he can throw me off this aircraft, he's a free man. Faster. Ask your questions faster or I'll have him throw your ass out of here. Where were you on the nights of January 28th...? What the fuck...? Bring me another gook. My unit is the most decorated unit in country. We have the highest body count of any unit in Vietnam. Ask the little fuck where the 58th Division is. If you two don't start asking me some pertinent questions... ...I'm gonna goddamn court-martial your asses right here, right now. Have you ever murdered any prostitutes in the city of Saigon? No, I have never killed a prostitute. I pinken girls' asses with a riding crop. That's my little trip. Only now, you two assholes are gonna put it in your report. My career will be fucked for all eternity. I have never killed a whore. And I'm gonna prove it to you beyond a shadow of a doubt. Ask him the same. Another fucking bullshit artist. Now, that man may have been a bullshit artist... ...but I admired him. He didn't whimper. I don't whimper either. I walk it like talk it. Now, if I killed a prostitute, I will stay in the aircraft. If I did not, I will jump. You got that? Shit. Oh, Christ. Put your hands up. I said, get your fucking hands up. You killed the goddamn colonel. - We didn't kill him. He fucking jumped. - We're CID. The colonel was under investigation for multiple civilian murders in Saigon. He committed suicide. Just ask him. Colonel Armstrong wild-fuck son of a bitch. He jump out. - We're going back to the firebase. - Like shit we are. They'll waste us. Take us to the MPs in Saigon. Either that or you shoot us here. It's your call, pal. Jesus Christ, the goddamn colonel. The shit's gonna hit the fan. We're gonna have shit all over the fucking place. Now you two are in big fucking trouble. Why is that? Keep it down till we get outside, huh? You sorry assholes. Took some doing but I got you released to my custody... ...because they're all waiting for General Bower to get back from Guam. - And the rumors are flying. - What kind of rumors? How you forced the colonel to take a plane ride... ...so you could grill his ass till he killed himself. Right. Meantime... ...the crazy motherfucker's body-bombing VCs and killing whores. - The man was guilty. - All right. The game plan is this: We go over to the office, I get your depositions. We'll get you to your billets, get your shit, get on the plane out of here. What do you mean, "out of here"? Your traveling papers, girls. Just came through. You report to Fort Ord, California, Monday, 0800 hours. What? Somebody fucked up. They're rotating you a couple of weeks early. What, you looking a gift horse in the ass? Shouldn't we be here to defend ourselves when they start the investigation? That's what the deposition is for. It turns out Armstrong is like young Jesus around here... ...and the brass is mightily pissed. In a couple days, they'll get used to it. Until then, they're looking for blood. They don't care whose. You're leaving. Orders is orders. Well, it's a duffle-bag drag. When I was looking through Armstrong's Form 20... ...I noticed he was a young lieutenant back in Korea. We had the same thing going on over there. Hookers being killed? Yeah, same m.o. Went unsolved back then. Wouldn't surprise me if it was the same guy. - Ready? - Yeah. Look... ...I'd have got you something better, but it all happened pretty quick. - I'll open mine right now. Go ahead. Lord have mercy. Hey, look, don't bite any stews' rumps on the way home. I got you on a commercial flight. Thanks, Dix. Not for this. - It was a good tour. Yeah, our paths will cross again. I only got six months left in this shithole myself. Maybe I'll put in for Ord, huh? Take the next right up here. What you wanna do? Give her a kiss goodbye? Just wanna tell her it's all wrapped up and say so long. She was a good Joe. Sister? Lanh. The dancer we visited. She was... ...killed last night. How did it happen? The same as the others. Only this time he killed the child. No, please. I'm sorry, Sister. I thought it was over. You two will be picking up where Perkins and McGriff left off. I'll be working close with you because now I'm pissed off. The files of this mess are over at HQ. Just get your asses over there right now. Son of a bitch. When did this come in, Dix? About a half an hour after you left. - Who are these guys? - The new investigators. - You guys are out of here. - Not yet, we're not. You miss that flight and you are AWOL. You got 40 goddamn minutes. Come on, get. Hey, take these two to Tan Son Nhut and stick with them. Goddamn it. Can't you see? Someone sped up those orders because of what we're working on. That is either true or it is not. In either case, I'm the one that's gotta deal with it. You are enlisted men and they can put you in fucking jail. Move them out! I'm coming. Oh, man, fuck them insect hookers. I refuse to give a shit. We weren't doing it for them. We were doing it for us. To give it all some kind of fucking meaning. Leaving this place outside a plastic bag is all the meaning I need. Get down! Hey. Hey. Jesus. I was hit. Am I gonna be all right? Am I gonna be all right? I want... I wanna sit up. I wanna sit up. Jesus. The little fuck is coming back. He's coming back? What's he coming back for? - What's he coming back for? - Get down! What the fuck are you coming back for? Hey! What you coming back for? What the fuck are you coming back for? You motherfucker. Go ahead on. Hey, they had a prisoner. Just put it down. - Clear the streets, Neil. Spread out. Get this gun out of here. Come on, let's go. We're walking. - You're dead now, you motherfucker. Put him in the back. I ain't dead. Fucking gook motherfucker. I'm talking to you. What happened to you? Somebody on our side tried to kill us. I had no place to go. What time is it? It's almost 9. How badly are you hurt? I'm okay. I'm worried about my partner. I know where Nguyen is. I have known. I take her child to her every two weeks. Why didn't you tell us? I was sworn to secrecy. Where is she? She is with the Vietcong near Cu Chi. Will she talk to us now that her sister's been killed? She believes she will also be killed if she comes to Saigon. Can I go to her? Why not, Sister? You know these people. You could tell them what we're trying to do. You're an American soldier. Do you have any idea the hatred they have for you? Doesn't anyone give a fuck but me and my partner? Please, just hold me. I'm sorry, Sister. This world is so insane. What a play! UCLA with the ball again. Alcindor's at the top of the key. He wants it. He wants the ball. He's got it! Two men on him. Fakes left. Oh, what a move! That's the win. He gets his own rebound. He fakes again. Gorillas the ball and two points. Two points. He's fouled on the play. The crowd's going wild. Big man's gotta make two. Two to win the game. He sets. He shoots. He misses. Are you all right? Nothing can hurt the big man. How'd you get away? Medics took off my cuffs. Big man made a fast break... ...and he ran and he ran and he... You didn't hurt anybody, did you? Does big man wanna go for a ride? Where? Where we always been going. Swish. He says he can only get through the checkpoints for a short time. Sergeant McGriff? I'll spit in your fucking face. All right. All right. Stop shoving me. Stop shoving me. Shit. I'm going. Chickenshit motherfucker. Oh, Jesus Christ. We're gonna fucking die down here. Oh, my God. Nguyen. We've narrowed it down to two men. Which one? No here. Now, you look at these pictures. Look at these pictures. It's one of these. - Just... - No. There. This man here? This man here? Lime Green. Not Viet man. GI here. This picture old. He colonel now. Have ugly mark on arm. Oh, man. Where the fuck we gonna find him now? Oh, Jesus. Shit. He was an officer himself once, you know. He performed a series of heroic acts back in Korea. He was recommended for a field commission... ...to the rank of second lieutenant. But then his regimental commander saw his... His tattoo. Very working class. It so offended his regimental commander... ...that his field commission was never sent through. I've sinned. Hear my confession, Sister. Like a priest. Dix's regimental commander was married to a Korean woman. Typical. Whore. But he did love her. Yeah, boy. Killing her was the only way... ...to truly make him feel the kind of pain that Dix felt... ...by being cheated out of his commission. There were a few more after that. Pow. Pow. Get out of the fucking way! Then he behaved. For years, he behaved. One dog-eared noncom barracks after another. They gotta be up top. They gotta be. Dix's pain wouldn't just go away... ...no matter how many whores he killed. Goddamn you! If it wasn't for you, they never would have found him. Dix. Enough. How did it go? It was really beautiful. You should have come in. No, man. I ain't into that voodoo shit. California. - You ever been there? - Yeah. - You? - No. Different. You know who I got a letter from? Who's that? Remember that sweet thing... ...I met at the Memphis Pride? With big tits and huge nipples? So she writes me a letter and she starts it off: "My sweet Albaby... ...I love you too much." - "Love you too much." Peace.
