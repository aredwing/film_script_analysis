Out, out, brief candle. Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Do it again! Put this where it can't be found. Well, that'd be nowhere, then. Quickly. Neighbors are cooking bacon again. Beckett! Samuel! It's Daddy. Well, good morning, boys. Do you smell that? Nothing like the smell of bacon in the morning. What is for breakfast? Doughnut holes. Where's the money? What money? Oh, don't bullshit me, Beckett. I gave you everything I had. Well, then we're fucked. Heh. No, you mean you're fucked. I'm fucked. You're fucked. We're all fucked. It's not about the pronoun, Beckett. Where were you last night, Dad? You promised. God. I was doing the best I can to support you two boys is where I was last night. All right? W-W-What's this, huh? What's this?! No, wait. That's mine. You can't have that. No, nothing is yours, nothing. You got that? Do you think reading this shite is any good for you and your brother, huh? Do you? Get dressed. You're going to be late. Go. I know you all, and will awhile uphold the unyoked honor of your idleness. Yet herein will I imitate the sun, who doth permit base contagious clouds to smother up his beauty from the world. What? Go on. When again he please to be himself, by breaking through the foul and ugly mists... Being wanted, he may be more wondered at... You think those idiots are gonna notice? That, when he please again to be himself, being wanted, he may be more wondered at by breaking through the foul and ugly mists... They're not gonna tell if I miss a... But you will know, and then you'll lose focus, and you'll trip up. Do it again! Being wanted, he may be more wondered at by breaking through the foul and ugly mists of vapors that had seemed to strangle him. You're good. Heh heh. But at your age, I was better. Did you see that punk giving you the stink-eye on the bus? No. Could've taken him. Oh, yeah? Where'd you have taken him? Right. This should do it. You're good, but at your age, I was better. The world is grown so bad that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch. And since every jack's been made a gentlemen, there's many a gentle person made a jack. I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl. My secret mischiefs I set abroach I lay unto the grievous charge of others. And now they believe it. And thus I clothe my naked villainy... heh... with old odd ends stole forth out of Holy Writ... and seem a saint when most I play the devil. Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you. Listen, just keep kicking him in the nuts. Drag your keys across his face, and just keep kicking him in the nuts. All right, you got this. You can do this. Beckett, Miranda, are you ready? All right. It's late at night, and you're walking down a deserted street. Now start walking. Oh, boy. Hey! You all will not be here to save her. Look at me. Let's do it again, okay? Let's do it again, okay? Okay. Kick him in the nuts. Okay. No! Get his ass! I said no! I said no! No! No! Yes! That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. You dropped this in there. Ah, thanks, man. I wish I had a bunch of women trying to beat the crap out of me. Oh, you saw that, Little Larry? Pretty cool, huh? Yeah. Well, I was watching the class. I saw you take off that Darth Vader costume. I thought, "Holy shit. That's Beckett Emerson." Did you, now? Those chicks are pretty hot, huh? Uh, actually, a lot of 'em been through a lot, man. Yeah. So you could take advantage of their, uh, vulnerability. Know what I mean? Vulnerability isn't hot. Hot is hot. You wanna hang out? You know, I'd love to, but, uh, I'm really busy, man. Ah, yeah. I gotta be somewhere, too. My next bus leaves in five minutes, so... You're still taking the bus? You were the super boy geek. I thought you'd have a cush job doing, uh, computer science or something by now. Yeah. Well, yeah, I do have the perfect job. Holy shit. What do you do? I'll have to tell you another time. All right. Come on. Come on, man. Look, listen. Come on, get back here. I... I want to know what you do. You were in a hurry, remember? Not bad, 500 bucks and a snakeskin wallet. You know the rules. No wallets. It's snakeskin. Come on, Beck. All right, I'll burn it with the rest. How much we gonna give to him? A hundred, maybe two. We gotta pay the rent. Yeah, well, Rizzo can wait. What, you want to move house again? You know he's just gonna blow it all at the races or on his drink, whichever he gets to first. Hey, he wins sometimes, you know. Come on, now. Anyways, I figured out how to buy the house. So, we make money out of money. All right? First thing to do is invest in real estate. If the house is worth 220K, 10% down is 22K. With a loan at 4.5 interest rate, we'd be paying less in rent than we are now. Dad would be set. You're completely delusional. We don't have shit to invest. We just haven't tried to save enough yet. No matter where you put it, he's gonna find it. You're just pissed off 'cause he took your fricking comic. You know, outrun time, that would be it. Racing along like the Phantom Halo. Then we could just disappear to another place. There is no other place. The Phantom Halo used his radioactive powers to break himself free from the mud that had trapped him for millions of years. We're... We're not in the mud. We're up to our necks in it. You know, we could harness it like the Halo did. You know, it's official. That comic book is co-opting your brain. What the... How's my favorite little rats doing today? Rizzo, what up, man? You locked us out? Zip it. Word's on the street your dad's in pretty deep. How much you need? All of it. The rent's late. How 'bout 350? How about I have my boy Ronnie pay you a visit? And before you can count to 10, he'll have all your shit sitting out on the sidewalk. The hood could take their piece, and you'll wind up empty. Yeah. Move all that this way. Ah, all of it. My shoes sure could use a shine. Fuck you. Do not polish his shoes. I only did that once. I'll kill him. Hey, hey, hey. What the hell is this, huh? Huh? I know what you're up to. You don't try getting big on me, huh? Eat it. Eat it. You do what you're told. Now swallow it. Swallow it. That's a good boy. I'm gonna get some sleep. You be a good boy. Fuck. I know you all, and will awhile uphold the unyoked honor of your... idleness. And, like bright metal on a sullen ground, my reformation, glittering over my thoughts, shall be seen to be more goodly and attract more eyes than that which hath no foil to set it off. I shall so offend to make offense a skill... redeeming time when men think least I will. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thanks. Where'd you learn to do that, kid? Hard to say, really. What's your name? Samuel. Samuel. You know, you remind me of a once-dear friend. Yeah? Yeah. He perform around here? No, no, no. West End of London. Those were his playgrounds. You know, let me do my bit. Heh. Oh. Good luck, huh? You look like you need it. I am a villain. Yet I lie. I am not. Methought the souls of all that I had murdered came to my tent; And every one did threat tomorrow's vengeance on the head of Richard. Whiskey, please. Warren. Hello, darling. And the rest? Buy a thirsty man a drink? It's short. I had a bad night. Yeah, and it's only just begun. Now what we've... What we have, we... What we have, we... What we have, we clothe not to the worth of the world. We enjoy it, but until lacked and lost. Speak plain English. You know it only costs four cents to make a $100 bill? Oh, yeah? Did you know that the bills were made exclusively by Crane Paper, chock-full of wood pulp, cotton, silk, and linen. You have to tell the whole world what you know, and yet you can't even pay your debts. I've made good in the past every single time. Yeah. You were playing with puddles. Now you're in the deep end, and it turns out you can't swim. I can swim. You look like a drowning man to me. I can swim. Damn it! We need the ingredients, butter, flour, eggs. So go buy it then. He found the new hiding place. The son of a bitch. Look, I'll... I'll figure this out, all right? You didn't have what I needed. So sorry. Say hello to Grace for me, by the way. What day is it? November 20th, Dad. Oh, Christ almighty. Look, Dad, you got all the stuff. You even left the butter out and everything. Yeah, yeah. You don't need to tell me what I did. I did it, so I... I guess I know. What the hell happened to your foot? I cut myself shaving. What do you think? Uh... All right, out. Get out so I can do my work. Out. All right. That's it. Cut the cake. She might still come. Cut the cake. Can we just wait another five minutes, please? You both lied to me. Come on. You were just a young boy who needed to believe that... Oh, come on. Don't tell me you... you didn't know what was going on. I didn't know. Well, then I should have told you the truth. I will find her. Oh, you will go places in the world, my boy, but I doubt a bus pass will get you to that woman's abode, wherever the hell she is. Dad. Who's there? Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee. You boys haven't been stupid, have you? Mr. Lee, how the hell have you been? Uh, would you like a beer? Makes my face turn red. Oh, some whiskey, then? Milk, flour, three eggs... butter. I did it. You know the rules. We don't steal from this neighborhood! "Think and Grow Rich." You got to have one before you get the other? This guy thinks so. Well, what do you think? It's more complicated than that. You know, I've seen your brother doing Shakespeare, even given him a few dollars. I don't have a brother down here. Beckett. How do you know my name? My name is Roman, an old friend of your father's. He ever mention my name? My father's dead. No, he's not. Just a lousy father, but he's not dead. Sit. Now we're going to speak like men, honest. I know exactly who you are. I like your father. I like him very much, but he owes me a lot of money. So I thought, "Beckett, he'll know what to do. He runs the whole household." I need it back. Two weeks. How much? 38,000. No. Yeah. He came to me with 25, had been on a good run. I matched his 25. Where the fuck did he get $25,000? Now, that's a question for him, isn't it? If you can't get me my money, I'm going to have to have a different conversation with Samuel. You and Donny been getting along? He seems disgruntled. I'm sorry. What'd you say? Larry, when I say something and you don't listen, it makes me feel... I don't know... invisible. No, you're the opposite of invisible. What are you doing here? I didn't have your cellphone number. Um, this is Beckett. This is Ms. Rose. I should cover up. Seems like most people in this world welcome company, but... well, we aren't most people. Who the hell is this? I'm here to clean the pool. He's just an old friend, Donny. We were altar boys together. You should go back to being an altar boy, 'cause you did a shitty job with the pool. Why don't you boys, uh, go polish your chalice or something so I could focus on my Rosie here in our dirty, dirty little pool? Donny. We were just having a conversation with my ma, Donny. Now you're not, so scoot. All right, Ma. We're gonna head out. It was nice to meet you, Ms. Rose. Maybe we can take this up another time. I don't see that happening, as I rarely think of the past. Okay. Hey, what happened to your eye, man? Nothing. So what's up? It's another time. What? Where'd you get the cash, man? That was Monopoly money. I was just showing off. It was real. Come on. Heh. Stand in line. There is no line, brother. And you think I got something for you? I think you got a shiner, and you ain't telling me shit. I also think you need someone, someone that's got your back. I got enough trouble. Come on, man. We all got trouble. Hey, how come you didn't tell me your mom looks like a movie star? 'Cause she's my mom. What? She's always looked like a movie star. Hey, you want to get us some girls? Why don't you get your own girls? 'Cause they won't be as good as the ones you get us, you scammer. It's a two-way street. All right. She's really, really pretty, I'll think about it. Okay. Yeah. First we need to get you some new clothes, though. My favorite shirt. Where's Dad? I don't know. You should get some sleep. Oh, I need some parts. Don't look at me. I'm not stealing any parts. Come on. Just the carburetor. Out of my realm of expertise. You're no help. Get some sleep. I don't know what we're doing here, but thank you for including me, by the way. Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Want to see a magic trick? Why not? All right, take this hundred. Buy a pack of gum. Bring me back the change. And don't buy that fruity shit. I hate fruity gum. How you doing? That's 1.75. That's the smallest you got? Yeah. 60, 80, 100. Pleasure doing business with you. Got your old man gum. All right. Beckett! Samuel! Where are you? We've got mail. Please, Dad, you gotta stop. But I haven't even started. Jesus Christ. Waking up every morning with a beer and moving on to the whiskey, spending every last penny... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Watch it, son. Remember your place. Son? I'm the one keeping us afloat. This is my house, my chair, my table, my books. When was the last time Sammy's went to school? Do you even remember? What the bloody hell does he need a public-school education for, eh? I'm teaching him. Yeah. To wear tights and be a circus act, but he can't multiply, subtract, add. Since when do you care about addition, you... you pikey jock? Well, if you can't take care of him, I will. Oh. Heh heh. You think you're so strong, huh, so grown-up, but you're just a petty thief slipping his hand into the pockets of the world. That's what you taught me. Son of a bitch. What? Nothing, man. It's my dad. He's in a bad way. Come on. Ah, I knew the geek inside of you was up to something, man. I made them, all of 'em. And you're living like you're hungry, man? Wait, so that $100 bill... Yeah, that was a test run. Oh, my... This is epic. Where are the rest of the hundreds? Those are the last two, and Donny only lets me print fives and twenties. That asshole that showed up at your house? Who the fuck is he, really? My mom's ex-cousin-in-law. And? And I been helping Donny since I was a kid. A few years ago, he had me take over, and he comes in every two weeks. I give him what I make, and we change for cash. Okay. What's the cut? 25-75. 25? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold... So let me get this straight. You've been working for him for years. You're still taking the bus. You're swimming in dough here, and you ain't got shit to show for it. The Feds have assholes just looking for people like us. Donny survived 'cause he doesn't spend. What is the point of having money if you're not gonna spend it? He has a guy that comes in every two weeks and brings a set amount of paper and ink. I have to account for every little thing that I use. If I mess up a sheet, I have to save it so Donny can rest easy I'm not stealing from him. Did Donny give you that, too? Is that a part of the deal? The rules are in place so we don't get caught. Bullshit. That's... They are. The cashier at Maceo Mart used that pen on that $100 bill, and it passed with flying colors. Of course. It's the perfect note. We gotta get this asshole at his own game. Where is he now? He'll be back in two weeks. He lives out of town. We can move loads in that time. I do have a guy who can get us our own paper and ink. Then let's call him. Okay. Yeah, yeah. To get this right, though, we need the Heidelberg. Okay. Okay. What is a Heidelberg? It's the final piece. Then let's get the final piece! Come on. This is it. This is it. Dude, this looks like it belongs on a ship. Oh ho ho. I'm gonna make flawless hundreds with this baby. Get the lift. Go. 42,500, right? That's my cut? Yes. Get the lift. Yeah. Oh, God. Let's bounce. Grace. Hey. Hey. What are you reading? Uh, this month's "Phantom Halo." He's trying to save these two planets from hyperwar. Super cool. So, um, is... is Grace your Chinese name? We're Korean. My father wanted this. He said too many thieves is bad for business, and business in this neighborhood's been very bad. Samuel, what's going on out there? Shh. We're even now. You don't have to worry. Ahh! Come in, Sam. Rehearse. What's going on? Oh, my God. Who did this to you? What... What... Three guys, they just... To you, your father should be as a god... one that composed your beauties, yea, and one to whom you are but as a form in wax, by him imprinted... and within his power to leave the figure or disfigure it. Sammy, what's with the duct tape? You're gonna get an infection. You're an infection. You know, I been... sat here waiting for you for hours, and look. I made, what, six bucks. And two of those are mine to begin with. It's fine. I got cash. What? I thought we were a team. Listen, Sammy, I'm really sorry I wasn't there last night. Where'd you get that money? I got you... some antibiotics, some tape. We don't need you losing any more limbs. And look. Ha ha. No laces to tie. Where'd you get that money, Beck? Come on. Let's get you home. You don't look so good. I got it. Ms. Rose. Oh, Beckett. You scared me. Larry's not here. What are you doing, Ms. Rose? Cutting watermelon, Beckett. I love watermelon. You shouldn't show up uninvited. Do you even know what to do if a man comes at you with a knife? If you're gonna attack me, just get it over with. Attack you? Ms. Rose, I teach this stuff. Here. I love this shirt. Please don't get blood on it. Okay. So now what would you do? Well, if I had a gun, I'd shoot you. But you don't, so what would you do? Call 911? No. Grab my hand here, here. Twist under. There you go. Knee me in the... What would you do now? That was pathetic, Ms. Rose, like flipping a pancake. Ohh! Okay. Oh, my God. Watermelon? So what about your family? Never mind. You don't have to answer that. It was just me, my little brother, and my dad. My mom took off. How long ago was that? Six years. Beckett, do you have a girlfriend? Heh. Heh heh. You ever been in love? Have you? I don't see a man here now. I'll tell Larry you stopped by. Can I come visit you again? Oh, Beckett, I don't think that's a good idea. You feel that heat? I don't feel much these days. If we shadows have offended, think but this, and all is mended. I come from dirt... and it is dirt which defines us... dirt from which all things grow. Even one as mighty as the Phantom Halo has the mark of dirt upon his skin. But no one truly ever escapes their home. And when the Phantom unveiled his mighty wings, the very winds changed direction, and the downtrodden cried out to see such beauty. And so I ask you... and you and you and... and you and you and... and you and all of you, how much more will you have to bear before you say, "I am done?" The time is mine. Dad would kill you. Well, look at all this money. Puck to Pig Latin? You're breaking the rules. Oh, you're one to talk. This money will never be enough. The Phantom Halo was here today, and the winds themselves will shift direction. Jesus, and now a weather report. You never listen, do you? You know, you're just like Dad. You're just like Dad, a lost dreamer. Well, I don't need you here, man. My conscience hath a thousand several tongues, and every tongue brings in a several tale, and every tale condemns me for a villain. Perjury, in the highest degree; Murder in the direst degree... throng to the bar, crying all, "Guilty!" "Guilty." Oh, so he does remember Shakespeare then. Two stars keep not their motion in one universe. In one sphere. We're done here. Dude, this guy Donny used to work for Smashmouth. We can run the hundreds through him. This better work. Fire it up. Okay. Whoo! I'm nervous. Here we go. Oh! Yeah, it's a door, and I love it. Ah, I love the smell of a new car. - Don't stop. - Don't stop. What are you doing? Oh. Uh, I was looking out the window and noticed the grass was uneven. Thought I'd come out here and fix it. I'm giving myself blisters. Well, why don't you go inside and relax? The weight that we carry, mud, is truly the weight of our unfolded wings. It is our... our right... our... our journey to become more like the Phantom Halo... marked by mud, but not trapped by it. So did Donny buy you this place? What do you know about Donny? Nothing. I just... Big Larry's idea of fun was to whack me in the face, so I ran away when Little Larry was a baby, and Donny, Big Larry's cousin, took pity on us and gave us this place to live. Does he touch you? No. End of story, Beckett. Go on. Get out of here. Do you like me? Yes, I do. Samuel! Yeah. Come inside! It's getting late! All right. Now. Okay. Oh, why do you even bother? I won... I won that piece of junk in a poker game. It kicked on me years ago. Car needs oil, Dad. Well, I put oil in that car. Where? In... In the oil hole. Why aren't you working, Dad? Oh, I did... work. Oh, you should have seen my Hamlet. My boy, my darling boy. Come on. Come sit. No. I'm too big. Oh, come on. Please, please, sit. Come sit, please. Please. Dad... Come on. Ah, here. Ohh. You know... I... I don't understand why you brought home so little. You know what I'm saying? I'm starting to think that you're stealing from me. No, Dad. I'm... I'm not. The crowd wasn't carrying nothing today. Anything. Anything! Listen to you. Your dumb brother's rubbing off on you. If you ask Beckett, he'll say the same thing. Well, where is Beckett? She's gorgeous, simply gorgeous, but a bit too old for you. She's just a friend. You've got sex written all over your face. Really is amazing how much you learn about anatomy in my line of work. Ahh! See, if I have my friend here push his knife any further, he'll sever your iliac artery. Now, this artery splits as it descends and then divides again from the aorta, which supplies blood to your lower limbs. You'll lose use of your legs, your dick, all the important parts. Now, I thought it was important that we have a visit like this so I could light the fire. And, you know, I was right, because I feel much better. Samuel brought home $40 today. $40? That's impossible. Are you stealing from me, Beckett? Are you serious? Where's my Tony Hawk skateboard, hmm? My Star Wars collection? My gold cross and chain? Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened to you? Oh, this? This is what your friend does. What? How much money do you owe Roman? D-Did Roman do that? No, no! No! No! You're gonna get us all killed. I'm gonna save your life, son. I promise. No one will ever touch you like that again, ever. You're delusional, and if you don't stop drinking, you're gonna die alone. Why don't you make that last? I gotta go lay down. Hey... Hey, Beckett, wait. Wait. Do you want some mor... Do you... I love you. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow... creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time... and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle. Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury... signifying nothing. Who's there? It's Little Larry. Remember me? No. Beckett's friend. What's with the bag? Oh, uh, Beckett and I are starting a new workout regime, so... Beckett! I'm out here. About to take your dad to the gym instead of you. Not... Not today. Yeah? I'll run circles around your fat ass. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Sir, do you mind if I use the restroom before we head out? No, no, not at all. Go to the end of the hall, to the left. Great. Hmm. Where do you know him from? It was a boy home. Oh, that criminal camp? I don't want him here. You know, he's probably stealing soap as we speak. We don't have any soap, Dad. Well, then get... get some. You remember when Mom used to freak out and scramble for quarters when that thing came around? Don't go reminiscing about the past. It wasn't any better then. Yes, it was. No, it wasn't. Sorry about the soap. You didn't wash your filthy hands, did you? Oh, I just took a piss. But you had your hands on your pecker. I don't touch it. Ah, that's a trick I don't know. Should we? Yeah, let's go. Lovely home, honestly. Okay. What's with the bag? Gym clothes, man. I was serious about working out. Helps with the chicks. Heh heh. Little Larry? Hey. Damn. Is this yours? Where'd you get this? We bought it. It's pretty sweet, right? We? With what? Have you two lost your heads? This is what you've been up to? We don't even have groceries, and you... you bought a fucking Bentley? I'm handling it. I'm hungry, Beck. Get yourself some food. Don't treat me like a kid. Stop acting like a kid. Good to see you, Samuel. Look out. Ohh! Give me another one. Got a lot. Oh, thank you for the present. Let me do the talking, all right? Just as long as I get my 42 grand. Oh, we'll come back with a lot more than that, man. Smashmouth. You gotta be... Smashmouth. What you got... Smashmouth. Full house, baby. Check it out. Huh? Ow! Let go of me. Let go of me, man. God damn it. Get off me. God damn it. I have new pajamas made every month. Don't they, uh, sell 'em at the store? These are Italian silk. You know, I had a silk shirt once. It felt really good on my skin, smooth, silky, if you will. Is that retard Donny still teaching you everything that you know? Jesus Christ, you haven't done or said one intelligent thing yet today. Look, I'm done with Donny, okay? I did this from my lab, and it is flawless. Take a gander. Donny know you're here? No, of course not. Good. Best that way. Yeah. I wouldn't want him to get his panties wet. He's a jealous man. That he is. Now, I understand you arrived in a Bentley. Yeah. Continental Supersport. You pay cash for that? Yeah. What else? You're not only being taught by a retard. You are a retard. And if you ever come around here waving cash like a lunatic again, I'm gonna rip your face off. You got that? I'll see if this passes, and then we'll be in touch. Oh, ye... uh, I thought we were gonna do the... the exchange? Well, you thought wrong. I see it. You... You don't... Beckett? They took the briefcase out of the trunk. There's nothing left. We need to get out of here now. Let's go. For your trouble. Do you think this is gonna cover it? I did all of this because I assumed a payday was in order. My pops always told me never to assume anything, and now I'm just an ass with a fat lip who's three steps closer to his fucking grave! We just need to wait for Smashmouth. Smashmouth is a psychopath. We ain't getting our money back! Open your fucking eyes, man! Holy shit. High school girls, man. Oh, my God. Yeah, bend over. Are you serious? Your dick is blinding you, man. It's just having fun. This isn't fun. Hey. How old are you? 18. Why? Give me the fucking money. You're acting like a juvenile. Jesus. You know, Samuel was right. We're stuck in the mud. God, I'm better than this shit. No, you're not. We are who we are, Beckett. We are who we are. Well, I'm outta here. Can't go anywhere, dude. I have the car. Get outta here. Get outta here. Get outta here! Get the fuck outta here! It's okay, Samuel. Oh, it's... it's super late. I know. I snuck out. I have something for you. Well, you had something for me last time, too. I found this in my grandfather's stuff. I'm sorry. It's kind of old, but I think you might like it. 1961? This is his first appearance. This is his origin. You know, just like Shakespeare's Prince Hal, everyone underestimated the Phantom Halo. Prince Hal? Yeah. He ran with this group of thieves in the underbelly of London, and then he threw away his old clothes and became King Henry V and then successfully conquered France. I... I can't... I can't take this. This is worth, like, $100,000. What's going on in there? Beckett! That's my pop. Samuel! He's drunk. Beckett. It's so late. I don't even know what I'm doing here. What happened to your face? Don't worry. Little Larry's fine. I wasn't asking about Little Larry. I gotta get out of here, Rose. My whole family, we gotta go. What do you mean? When I was a kid, my mom used to take off her wedding rings to do the dishes. She had this weird idea that the dish soap would wear away the gold. She loved those rings, said they were the prettiest things she'd ever owned. When I was 13... my dad lost his paychecks at the track. He knew she'd kill him, so he told me to steal those rings. So... But instead, I went to my friend's house. I took their TV and all their jewelry. Heh. But I was untrained. I got caught. And that was the bad stuff? I did what I was told, and I took the rings. The day before I got out of juvie, my mom found 'em in my room. When she asked me why I took 'em... all I could think about was protecting my father. So I looked her in the eye... and I said, "Because it was an easy take." Nothing was ever the same between us, and then she left. And you think she left because of you. Wouldn't you? You can think what you want, but she left two young boys with a drunk. I have something for you. You took that? You... You make me want to be honest. Not necessary. We are even. I'm coming back tonight to get you. I won't be here. I'm not gonna say goodbye to you. Carlene, Carlene, I need the money now. You said under no circumstances to give you that money before closing. I'll give you $1,000 if you give it to me now. No. I'll see you at closing. No, no, no. Things have changed. Now means now. So you'll give me $1,000 and promise you won't get me fired. A thousand times, yes. This is the employees' bathroom. Come out! Come out! We're good. You're naughty. Oh, I am. Where'd you get all this money, anyway? Oh, I am a part-time stripper. Whoo! Heh heh. You're funny. Still sealed. Good girl. Here. See, that's... Here. Ha ha! Samuel. Samuel. What? Let me in. I... I left something in your closet. What were you doing in my room? Beckett told me I could hide something in your closet. No, you're lying. Beckett knows there's nothing safe in this house. Jesus, come on in. Whoa, whoa, whoa. W-What are you doing? No. No! Come on! No! Fuck! What the hell are you doing? Where is it, you little shit, huh? What? Get off me! Where is it, huh? Come here. You little fuck. Where's my money?! What are you doing? Where's my fucking money, huh? You left money in this house? Unbelievable. No, it was... Donny. You know I hate coming here, right, Rosie? I gave that boy everything. And he appreciates it. We appreciate it. Did you know I waited two hours today? And now I got this bag of lunch here for you to give to Little Larry, but I'm guessing he is not here. No, he's not. Huh. Rumor has it he's been driving a Bentley. Bentley, as in like Rolls-Royce? Yeah. Jesus, Donny. Hey, he's been seen. Let me get you a drink. Shit! He's out spending counterfeit money all over town right now. We are so screwed. What, counterfeit? What were you thinking about putting the money in this house? He couldn't possibly have spent all the money. How much? What? 150K. He's in the gutter right now throwing all of that up. Are you guys messing with me? My dad? He's probably having the time of his life right now. You're a fucking idiot. You know, I never understood what Beckett ever liked about you. We're brothers. You're not... Beckett and I are brothers, and you're just some asshole from the past that thinks it's a good idea to hide money in the house of a thief. You and Beckett are the thieves! Well, what the hell does that make you? I'm an entrepreneur! Oh, my God. You smell like her. Okay, chill out. Chill out. You son of a bitch. You are never gonna see her again. Back off! Damn! Where'd you learn to do that? Phantom Halo did it once to the Stinger. I've always wanted to try it out. Whew. He changed the key code on the door at work, Rose. I've never been there. How the hell am I supposed to know what he's up to? I need some distraction. 'Cause I'm an angry man, Rosie, and I'm trying not to hurt anybody. Get out. You need to take care of the hand that fucking feeds you first. Play nice. You make me so horny. Fine. Fucking play dirty then. Might be more fucking fun that way. Fucking fight. You've got the knife. You know, it's over for him. It's over for your boy. Father's home. Prepare his bed. Whoo! Where's the money, Dad? Boys, I had quite a night tonight. $150,000? I had quite a night! Quite a night. Where's the money? It's gone. It's gone. Of course it is. I'm gonna have to kill Roman. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We are not murderers in this house. This is what separates us from the beasts. You don't understand. Little Larry trusted me. We had a plan. Trust? Who would trust us? A plan? I mean, look at us. We're pathetic. And you, you are weak, and you hurt everyone... What?! Hey, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I saved a bit for Roman. Look. Look. Look, huh? This isn't enough. No, no, no. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. One more. Huh? I have another one somewhere. Wait, wait, wait. What the hell is that? It's Samuel's. How many times did I tell you not to bring this shit in this house?! Give me that. Whoa, whoa, Beck. Just... No. No. Just calm down, Beck. He can have whatever he wants. Samuel, get your things. We're leaving. No, Beck, just put the gun down. You see what you do? You let me down every single fucking time. I was king last night. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Go get your things! We're leaving now! You're not going anywhere! Anywhere! What the hell? Hey, get... Just get away from this! This is mine! You stole it! You had something you want to show me. It was perfect, wasn't it? Who the hell is this? Are you okay, Beckett? Fuck off. So I'm here. What do you got? Me and Beckett here will take you to... I'm not going anywhere with you. I'm not gonna go by my... What made you think you could get away with betraying Donny, hmm? I made the perfect note. Where's the lab? The lab! Even if I took you there, you could never do what I do. It takes years, you ignorant fuck. Good morning, Vietnam. Who's this idiot? Oh, fuck. I'm the only one who's gonna be killing around here. Oh, yeah? Bang! Bang? Bang? Who the fuck is this? This piece of shit stole my money. Th-That's a lie. That's my money, all of it. Well, this piece of shit is mine. No, Roman, look, look. I have your money right here, huh? What are you talk... That's counterfeit money. What's that? Yeah. I made it. Is that what this is all about? You need to turn around and exit right now. I can make you money, Roman. You can't make shit. Shut up, you little pussy. Put the gun down. You telling me what to do? Boys, boys, boys, boys, boys. C-Come on. Come on. Let's put the guns down and work this out. Clearly there's plenty of money to go around. Big man. Big fucking man. You think you've got it all figured out. Get your kids to parrot cash for you. All right, don't. He's just a drunk. He doesn't... He doesn't know what he's doing. And what is it you think you're doing? This comic book, all right, it's his first appearance from the Silver Age, the 1960s. Phantom Halo. What the hell is this? It's being auctioned online for, like, $100,000. You don't know who the Halo is? It's like not knowing who Spider-Man is. Probably 'cause he's a lousy jigaboo. Oh, God. It's not cool to be a racist. Your Shakespearean slave, where is he? I don't know. I don't know. He... He left. H-He was pissed 'cause I don't take any of his bullshit. Have you got my money? He doesn't have it. Now leave him alone! Can you pay your father's debts? You just did! Samuel! Shakespeare! Shakespeare! Samuel. Samuel. Samuel. Samuel. Hey, Roman. Oh, shit. Oh, my... Dad! Dad! Dad! Oh, my... Beck. Hey. Beck! Beck! Wake up, Beckett! Beckett! Come on! Beckett! Beckett! Beckett, wake up! Wake up, Beckett! Ohh. Oh, God. Ohh. You okay? Oh, that hurts. Come on. Are you okay? You okay? Come on. Where... Where's Roman? I'm so sorry. Where's Dad? Oh, God, he's... No. Okay. All right, come on. Come on. Come on. You gotta come on. Let's go. You fixed it. Yeah. Come on. Now wait here. "My darling Larry, "Do not go back to the house ever. "I'll get in touch soon. "Don't worry. "And please tell Beckett he saved my life. He should know that." What did you do with this car? Wait. So is this why money's gone missing? We're disappearing to another place. Full fathom five thy father lies: Of his bones are coral made. Those are pearls that were his eyes: Nothing of him that doth fade, but doth suffer a sea-change into something rich and strange. Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell: Ding-dong, hark! now I hear them... ding-dong, bell.
