Uh-huh. Although the traditional sense of the word "bird" just... Look up here. That's cool. Here, open your mouth real quick. Here, I'm gonna put this in. I can see your fillings. Oh. I don't have any fillings. Oh, what is that underneath your two front teeth? It's a splint. - I used to have braces. - Uh-huh. And they thought my teeth were gonna move... Do tell. Apart from each other. Okay, that's good. You can get up. Whew. - Ready? - I am ready. - There you go. - Okay. I'll be ready for your swift kick this time. Okay. And whoa! Okay. Good. Actually, you know what? Sorry, I forgot to do this. - Okay. - So this may... Just make sure I don't fall over on you. Okay. Okay. Good? - Yeah. - Okay. Gonna do this quick. And... All right, we got it. Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely. You're awesome, girl. Start moving out. All right, pack it up. I like it when they're more from the back, like... Here, go back out. Let me see. Oh, yeah. Okay. I like more from the back and not, like... You know, like, from the side, like these. - Mm-hmm. - No, I agree. I think you should... you should run towards it. You know what I mean? Yeah. No. Does it cross over like this? Yeah, just start... You go, like, one over? Yeah, and then maybe you should go under. I just like to look at it. I don't know how to do it. I think the blue would look really nice with her. Mm-hmm. And she also has these really great red tights that I think will go really well. Oh, perfect. And this bra, like, really stretches really well, and we can cut it without it just, like, completely falling apart. So I think... I just think it'll also look really good. As long as she's got the red tights... - Yeah. - I don't care. And she needs something on top also. I don't know. She's just in the trunk, looking kind of scared, and, uh... - Can you hold this? - Yeah, hold on a second. 'Cause we're gonna want to shoot into the sun, so maybe if you're, like, over here, kind of getting a... Okay. This kind of deal. Uh-huh. Stop it. How does that feel? Yeah. You know, we're just gonna do sort of a reveal kind of thing with her just in the trunk, looking terrified of you or whatever. And then we're gonna kind of break them into stages. It'll be, like, number one, you know, lifting her up out of the trunk with your hands kind of underneath her. You don't like it, but, like, have you ever dated anyone who really liked short hair? Mm-mm, I've only dated people who like long hair. I had a boyfriend who had, like... He, like, made it, like, a thing. Like, he, like, fetishized it. Oh, so you cut your hair short? No, no, no, no, no. Like, he tried to get me to cut my hair, but I wouldn't. And then you broke up? And then I broke up. Well, we broke up because I cheated on him. Anyone else been in here? The two of us and... the guy who found her. When was that? I got the call about an hour ago, maybe a little more than an hour. He still here? Yeah, we got him in the car. Jeez, that's a lot of blood. All right. Let's go talk to the boyfriend, I guess. Feeling all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Okay. Let's go. Actually, I think she needs a little bit more. Ooh, I didn't realize it was so easy to tear a shirt. Keep this one straight and then this one as much forward as possible. And then if you can just kind of look back here. Mm-hmm. That's out, and we're good to go. - Okay. - Okay. Boom, boom, boom, I got it. I'm so fast, I have to... You keep losing the... the rope there. Oh. Here, actually, you should put it... you should put it back on. No, the rope behind your back. - Yeah? - Yeah, it's a good look. Yeah, like that. You're not gonna get involved in that? Cheers. Yeah. No, cheers, you looked really good in them. - Thank you. - You're so cute. Did you like the red tights? They're yours. - Yeah. - Thank you. I'll wear them sometime. I don't know when I might ever find... Like, if you're on another photo shoot? Yeah, if you ever want to reshoot that. - Yeah. Oh, yeah. - Maybe we will. Callie? Hey. Oh, hey, how are you? I'm all right. How are you? I'm good, thanks. Cool. - Oh, I'm sorry. - This is Billy. Hey, nice to meet you. And this is Alex. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Are you guys enjoying yourselves? Mm-hmm, yeah. - Cool. - Totally. I'm sorry. Oh, my... yeah, I know. It's really bad. No, I know. Okay. - No, it's fine. - It's fine. It was, like, this stupid accident. The bartender was shaking a cocktail yesterday, and I, like, leaned in for some ice, and my eye was just, like, right there. - Ooh. - Full momentum. Oh, it looks really cool, actually. Can I touch it? No, it hurts. Don't touch it. What are you guys up to? We just got done with a photo shoot. Oh, you're the photographer that you work with. The photographer. That's right. Well, can I get you guys another drink, or are you all set, or... We're okay. Okay, well, enjoy yourselves. - Nice to meet you. - Bye. Watch out. I'll give you one too. Poosh! Okay, I'll try that. Oh, let me try this one. This is so cool. Can I take pictures of you? - Totally. - This is awesome. What? Okay, get back on the couch. Move these. - Lie down? - Yeah. Now this feels like , in a good way. Thanks. I think it looks terrible, personally. - You don't like it? - It's terrible. I should probably take it off. - No, keep it on. - Keep it on. Oh, my God, if I looked like that... Do you want any? No, it's okay. Do you have any beer? Do we have any beer? Almost surely, yes. Move. I've been thinking a lot about when I was really, really little. Mm-hmm. I would play this pretend game with my best friend, Lauren, where I was, like, a Cinderella type... like, a really helpless woman with diabetes, and she was the evil stepsister, and she would, like, be injecting me with too much insulin, and she had to get on top of me. And sort of like, as she was injecting me, she humped me. And I think that's where I might have had my first orgasm. It's really fucked up to think about, if you think about how that might be affecting my choice... choices in life. I'm gonna go put on some music. She's comin' on me now With everything she knows now She's comin' on me now With everything she's seen She's cuttin' through the crowd With evergreens in both eyes She's makin' it known That I'm not gettin' away And even if I made a break For the door now There's no tellin' if I can make it to street I got love inside my guts My mind is more than fucking Lord knows The safer I face the grief We're all wastin' time we don't have And it's dyin' At the end of the day I still hope it's worth fighting for She's comin' on me now With everything she knows now With everything she says she knows But doesn't see And right before I say "Hey, let's think this over" She quickly turns her head 180 degrees Pushin' through the crowd With misery in both eyes She won the sudden name Before it was me So now I'm beggin', "Hold steady" Before she turns and walks away And now it's way too late To see what's in the haze We're all wastin' time we don't have And it's dyin' And at the end of the day I still hope it's worth fighting for Now you're all but a ghost in my heart And I'm tryin' Even if I could change You said, "Baby, don't bother" Breakfast is served. All right, what does your appetite reflect? I'll let you choose. Two bacon, three bacon. Two bacon, please. I'll take whatever. All right, that's yours. Mmm. Actually, do you guys want any coffee? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. All right. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Did you have fun last night? I did. Did you have fun? Mm-hmm. Aren't you glad you have such a sexy girlfriend? Mm-mm. - For you. - Thank you. Come on, out. Come on, Snowball, get out. Go on, get out of there. Here you go. Thank you. It's really nice to see you. You too. I had a lot of fun the other night. Yeah, I did too. Okay. Have you had a chance to look at the pictures? - I did. - Yeah? They look really, really good. - Really? - Yeah. You look really good in them. - Oh, cool. - Yeah. Actually, that reminds me, the waitress friend that you introduced us to the other night, the one with the black eye? Mm-hmm. What was her name? - Rebecca? - Yeah. Do you know if she's ever done any modeling before or if she's ever expressed any interest in it? Um... I actually don't know. I mean, I just think she's got a really cool look. Don't you? Yeah. Do you think that if, like... you know, like, if I called her and asked her, you know, about doing something that she would be weirded out by it, or... I actually have... I'm sorry. I don't know. You don't know? I'm sure she'd be happy. Do you have her number? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, do you want it? Yeah, if that's cool. Yeah. Yeah, that could work. Like, around 10:00. Okay. Yeah, okay, cool. All right. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye. What? Who was that? Just... just a friend of Callie's. Has he got a name? Billy. He's a photographer. Sounds like you just made that up. No, no. Why would I make that up? I got to go to work. I'll see you later, all right? Hello? I'll see you tonight. Who were you talking to? I was talking to that waitress from the other day. What? What? Are you expecting anybody? Are you William Wingard? Yeah. Detective Mike Bamfeaux. I was wondering if I could ask you a couple questions. Sure. Do you know a Shannon Fierman? She's a model. Got a photo right here. I don't think so. No, that's the model I booked for the shoot the other day, the one that didn't show up. Oh, right. Mind if I come in? Thanks. Shannon Fierman was murdered the day before yesterday. I've been going around and speaking with some of her friends and associates, and your name's come up a couple times as someone she might have worked with. I was just wondering if you might know anything that jumps out at you, anyone new in her life, an ex-boyfriend or someone. No, I just spoke to her over the phone to book the shoot. Nothing else. Did she ever mention an argument or feeling threatened? Was there anything... No, nothing like that. Nothing like that came up? Well, we're doing a shoot in the next few days. Maybe some of our people might have known her. I mean, you're more than welcome to come and ask around if you want. Yeah, that could be helpful. Here's my card. Call me if you think of anything, and, yeah, I could drop by. Sure. Thanks. Do you mind if I use your restroom? Should have never tried so hard - Hey! How are you? - Hey. How are you? - Hey. - Thanks for coming. Give me two minutes. I'm just gonna turn this in. Yeah, yeah, sure. Go over my stuff. You want to sit down? - Yeah. - I'll be right back. Should have never tried so hard So what kind of photos would... How would you describe the photos that you take? You want, like, a pretentious version of that or, like, just a straightforward version? - Just... I mean, I don't know. - Which one's better? I would say I take... personal fetish photos. Personal fetish? That's how I would describe it, yeah. But, like... but I mean that in the classiest way possible. Okay. Classy personal fetish photos. Mm-hmm. How do you come up with your ideas? Mm, you know, I don't really know. It's just, you know, you... just over the course of time, you just see things that look good or see things that you want to re-create. Does your girlfriend get jealous? - Mm... - Oh. That's probably a question you'd have to ask her, not me. She doesn't act like she gets jealous? I don't think she does, you know? Would you get jealous? Yeah, I think so. Maybe she gets jealous a little bit. Well, you're, like, interested in all these, like, women in, like, a sexual, fetishy way. Um... You ask her to wear tights. You ask them to wear tights. It's like, what's... How do you separate that? Mm... Again, you know, wrong person. I don't really... You don't separate it? Well, I just don't think about it, honestly, you know? I mean, if a problem arises, we deal with it. But, you know... I mean, part of it, you know, like, you know, she knows that... you know, that my attraction toward somebody else is usually what drives my interests. Yeah. And without that, then, you know, why else would I be shooting these things, you know? Right. So she's fine with that. When she met you, were you already doing it? Yeah. - Yeah, I guess... - Yeah. You'd have to be cool with it, I guess. Yeah. Okay, well, thanks for coming. - Rebecca, let's go. - See you. Who was that? Some guy? Where have you been? I was working late with Phil. Why didn't you call? I did. I called you at 4:45, but there was no answer. Then I got working and forgot. You knew I had to go to the cleaner's late this afternoon. So you're trying to tell me you called me then. I tell you, I did call, and then I got involved. Gangway! Huh? Huh? Me wants peace and quiet. I've been a bad boy. I should have listened to my mother. Who the fuck is texting you? It's just that waitress. Jesus. So how high do you want it? Let's keep her going, but just leave enough room so that her breasts are exposed, okay? Hey, boss. You want a couple 1Ks for this, or... Yeah, just go ahead and have them in there; Stand by. Oh! - What do you think? - Does it smell? "Does it smell?" I just can't stand the smell of these kind of things. Ugh. It looks really nasty, though. I can't really... I can't really look at it. I can't look away from it. Well, if it's grossing you out, then, you know, it's doing its job. So is this starting to appeal to you yet? I don't know. I'm not sure it's the kind of thing, you know, my mama would be proud of. What do you mean? You're just playing, like, a game of dress-up here. Yeah, I guess. But it's dress-up mixed with fine art. Fine art? Yes. Is that... all right, that's what we're doing here? - Well, yes. - All right. If you can't tell... if you haven't figured that out yet. Well, I wasn't sure. I thought it might be something different. Well, how would it be something different? I don't know. Because there's boobies? Yeah, I guess so. You don't think that something can be artistic if it has boobies in it? Well, I'm just curious. Like, what's the distinction here for you? Well, that's not my problem. I thought you were the artist. Well, exactly. I thought you were the one making it art. Well, I'm the irresponsible artist, so, you know... which is the sign of a good artist. If they're irresponsible? Sometimes. In this case, yes. Do you ever feel like you're not making art? Mm, well, right now, I don't feel like I'm making art, sitting here chatting with you. Yeah, but you ever feel like some of the photos you take are not art? Look who it is. - Hey. - How's it going, man? - Good. - How you doing? Fine. Fine. Everybody's back here if you want to chitchat. Yeah, that'd be great. Okay, come on back. How's the weather out there? Still raining. 20 more. Here, I'll count down. 20... Excuse me. Look alive. We got a police officer here. Everyone, this is Detective Bamfeaux. He'd like to ask you all some questions. I'd recommend starting with her. She's the most suspicious-looking. Have you ever seen this woman before or worked with her? Her name's Shannon Fierman. Mm-mm. She's a model. Mm-mm, I don't think so. Miss, do you know her? No. - Never met? - No. Can you just, like, get that? Okay. Ooh. I messed up. No, it's fine. Okay. Here you go. How do I get on this thing? Gotcha. Okay. So I can kind of slip in. Okay? Mm-hmm. Uh-oh. - Nice. - Okay. - I got it. - There you go. Let me, like... Is it cold? No, actually, it's kind of... it's, like, fine. Like, lukewarm. Smells like chocolate. Do you want to do anything with her hair? Let's look here. No, just keep it dry for right now. We'll do a couple with it dry, and then maybe we'll... you know, we'll switch it up later. But yeah, just stay the same. Is this tempting to you now? It's really cool, actually. Just hang out for just a second. - It feels cool? - Yeah, it does. Is it slimy? How often do you see shit like that? People killing themselves? Well, yeah, with, like, the wrists open and everything. It's pretty common. Supposedly, if you do it with a fine enough blade, you can't even really feel anything. You just get kind of sleepy as your life runs out of you. Just get kind of tired and warm. - Close your eyes. - Okay. - Hey, Alex? - Yeah? Thank you. I mean, I think cars are futuristic, you know? I mean, just anything, you know? Like, I think that maybe, if I had a past life, it was definitely before electricity. Hold on a second. Let me hold that. Hold that for me. Mm-hmm. Hello Oh, hey, what's up? How are you? I'm good. I'm good. Come on in. Is Alex around? Oh, no, she's still at her mom's for the weekend. - Oh, yeah. - I'm sorry. What are you doing around here? I just wanted to stop by and say hi. - Oh, yeah. - Do you know these guys? Yeah, kind of. How's it going? Hey. Thank you much. I'm actually not gonna stay, I don't think, so do you mind just telling Alex I stopped by? Oh, you're not gonna stay? No, I don't think so. Oh, okay, here, here. Let me walk you out, then. Okay. You're more than welcome to stick around. All right. Have a good night. Yeah. I'll see you soon, I hope. Good night. Pretty pictures. I guess. I don't know. I think I would feel funny about it. I couldn't look at them afterwards. I bet you would take, like, three, and then as you saw one, you'd want to take more. - Maybe. - I don't know. - You should just try it. - There's no... - Wait. Wait. Wait. - Hold that. Hold it. Hold it. Now, now, don't move. Don't move. Here. It's a waste of time Tryin' to stand in line Remember a place in time Wish you were savin' time Look for a warning sign Something to... Okay. Did you have a good time? - Yeah, I did. - Did you really? - Yeah, I did. I did. - Okay. I had... - Did you? - I had a very, very good time. Good. And... I hope that we do something like this again, if you ever feel like it. We should hang out. - Yeah, we should. - We should hang out. We should just go do something normal sometime too. Okay. It was so good to see you. - Mm. - Mm. Whose is this? That's Amy's. Oh. How'd the shoot go? It was fine. Came back here afterward? Mm-hmm. Oh, fuck it. Oh, I'm so glad you had a good time. Stop. Nothing happened? No. Seriously. Why are you taking naked pictures of women in our house? Have you ever done this before? Do you take... smutty pictures when I'm not here? No. No, seriously, we were just hanging out, and, you know, I mean... Well, what are you gonna do with them? What are you gonna do with the pictures? I don't know. I haven't really had a chance to look at them. Well, I'd like you to delete them. Could you please do that? - Well, I don't know. - I mean, there might be, like... No, I need you to delete them. I'm not being unreasonable. All right, all right. You want me to delete them. Look, we take pictures... Very specific pictures. All right, here. Just give me the camera. I'll delete the photos. I'll delete them later, okay? There might be stuff on here that I don't want to mess up. You know? But look, seriously. Fine. What are you doing here, Michael? I just stopped by to get a couple things. I'll be gone in a few minutes. You cannot keep showing up here unannounced. Do you understand me? Yeah, I know. I told you to leave. I meant it. I know. I used to be afraid that I'd get a call in the middle of the night and you'd be dead on a street corner somewhere. Now I'm terrified that you're gonna do something to yourself. I come home every day with a pit in the middle of my stomach, Michael, that you're gonna be dead on a floor and I'm gonna find you and have to deal with that. I can't do this anymore. I'm not cut out for it. Homicide detective is one thing. Depressed is a whole other one. I want a family. I want a future, Michael. I want a sense of security and safety in my life. I've done everything I can for you. I've gone above and beyond, and I just don't have it in me anymore. I just want you to get your stuff and get out of here. I'm sorry. Yeah, heard it before. How are you? I'm good. You excited about the shoot? Yeah, yeah. Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. You know, it just occurred to me the other day how, you know, I've been hanging out with Rebecca and all, and, I mean, it just kind of occurred to me that this might be a good starting point for her. Okay, cool. What would you have for her? What would she be doing? Well, I was thinking maybe switching you guys out. Oh, okay. Like, you know, it just... it just seems like we're gonna be on the soundstage, and... Mm-hmm. It's gonna be a controlled environment. There's not gonna be a lot of people wandering in and out. - You know. - Yeah. Totally. That makes a lot of sense. I think she'll be great. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay. But don't get me wrong. I want you there. Oh. You know, like, I want you to be there to help out, and... You know, if you want to be there. - Yeah, totally. No. - Okay. - Yeah, I'll help out. - Okay. I'm just actually gonna run to the bathroom really quickly. - Do you need anything? - No, I'm good. Okay. Late night? Maybe I should have some water. I don't know how long it's been in the backseat, but go for it. - Perfect. - It's got electrolytes. You know what's an aesthetic choice? You know, nature photos... photos like birds and trees. Yeah, but anybody can take that. And most people, you know, if you actually start looking at what people do when they first start taking photographs, it's... they always end up just going to, like, botanical gardens or something. If you ever go to botanical gardens, you just see all these, like, photography journalism students out there with their cameras, taking pictures of the same goddamn plants that everybody else has taken pictures of. You know, it's ridiculous, 'cause it's like, why can't they just go out to, like, somewhere where people don't photograph plants? Instead people actually go to locations where the plants are commonly photographed... the exact same ones. There's probably, like, hard drives and hard drives just filled with, like, all the botanical gardens across the United States with the same goddamn plants, year after year, when they bloom and die. You know what I mean? It's ridiculous. So, you know, at the end of the day, you know, doing that kind of thing is easy, and, you know, pulling together the resources, you know, to get a crew together, get makeup teams together, to get everybody all in on the game, you know, to re-create a interesting... maybe it's a crime scene. Maybe it's, like, a kidnapping scene. Maybe it's, like, some sort of, like, weird sex crime gone wrong kind of thing in the midst of it. You know, whatever it is, you know, you're actually making something interesting happen, even if it is dark or whatever. And that's just way more interesting than, you know, just going out and taking a picture of a fucking tree in your front yard or something. You know? I think photos of flowers are nice. I like looking at photos of... You know, I'm sure that there's photos of flowers out there that'll just blow my mind, you know? I just haven't seen them. All right, all right, well, why women? Why is it all those dead women? Why not some dead old guy, you know, with, like, a... Well, that's depressing, you know? It's not about them being dead or beat up or anything like that, you know. There's just... it's just a spice. You know, actually, you know what? It's ridiculous for me to even try to explain this, because it's not something that I even think about. It's just something that I do. And that's what... that's what you got to do in these situations. You can't say, "Why am I doing this?" You know, "Why, why, why?" You just have to be like, "Okay, I'm attracted to this, you know, and that's what I'm gonna do." And that's pretty much what photography, in general, is. You know? You just have to react to something that gives you some sort of, you know... some sort of, you know... emotional feedback that you can't quite explain. You know, I don't... I don't like looking at dead bodies. I don't like... I don't like seeing people actually get hurt. You know, it's not like that at all. Have you ever seen a real dead body? Um... I mean, like, at a funeral, not, like, just walking around and stumble across one, although I always thought that would be kind of cool to do. You know what might be a good fix for you? What's that? I don't know. Have you just tried, you know, smiling occasionally? - You know? - I Sm... I smile. Like... Let me see. I'm not... there's nothing to smile about right now. I'm not gonna smile right now. Well, see, that's the thing, is, you don't need anything to smile about. You can just smile. You know? Well, what is that? What's the benefit of that? Well, it releases endorphins or something. I don't know. You know, you smile, you feel good. You know? And if you don't feel good, I think if you get into the habit of smiling, you start feeling good. I think you should just, you know, start practicing smiling, personally. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Coming from Mr. Mopey over here. Listen. If you come near my girlfriend again, I'm gonna kill you! Kill you! Okay, okay, okay. - What's the matter? - Damn it. Nothing. What's the matter? Somebody busted out one of my windows in my car. What? What happened? I was just walking up to the door just a minute ago, and, you know, on my way up, I heard a noise, and I turned around, and there was somebody reaching in. And, you know, I chased him off, and, you know, that was that. You know? It's fine. I'm fine. Car's mostly fine. Did they take anything? I don't think so. You know, I'm just fucking annoyed that I have to, you know... It's just one more thing I have to deal with tomorrow. You know, I got to... now I got to figure out something to do with this window. Are you okay? - Seriously, I'm good. - I'm fine. No, your heart's beating really fast. Are you sure you're okay? I'm great. Take the book. Read your book. Cuddle back up. Just pretend like I'm not even here. Hey, look, just stay. Come on. You can't just break, like, the car window of, like, every new friend I have. It's crazy. I can't... I mean, how well do you know this guy? I...what does it matter how well I know this guy? What do you mean? I mean, these photographs, I mean, they're sick! They're not... I don't think they're... - Yes, they are! - Are you kidding? How do you know he's not taking advantage of you, huh? Because I talked to him. He's my... like, he's... He'll say anything! Are you crazy? You're talking about him like he's, like, a monster and I'm an idiot. I'm... I can't do it. - No, stop. - Come on, stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop, please. - No, don't. - Stop. Come on, stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Just... I'm sorry. I'm sorry too, all right? Look, we can fix this. I don't think so. - Yes, we can. - Come on. You don't listen to me. I'm listening right now. I can't stay. Come on, just... Don't... Where are you gonna go? All right, we got it. House lights! Beautiful work. Did I look dead enough? - You look good. - You look good. You look like a cop. Yeah. You look really good. You'd never do any of that stuff. Should we keep her pretty eye makeup on? Her eyelashes? I think she's hot. You think she has a nice bod? I'm gonna eat salad all day. She's really toned. But I don't like it. You don't? - No. - I really like it. Oh, my God, I... I would kill myself if I had her body. - No. - She doesn't... I don't... I don't like her body. - You don't? - No. I like my body. I like your... obviously I like your body too. She just happens to be the person who's naked today. - Well... - I'm jealous of both of them. Show her the badge. Do you think that that's a fake badge? I don't know, I... Let her touch the badge. Touch the badge? - Touch it. - That's a little... - It's real. - She doesn't have to. Do you feel like you're, like, in... like, a character in Silk Stalkings right now or something? - Silk Stalkings? - I've never seen that. It was, like, USA Up All Night. Just wait till she turns 25. It'll all drop. It'll all go down. My body is still... You just need to wiggle it a little. - I am wiggling. - Just give it a mm, mm, mm. Hazard of the trade, I guess. Acting dead. Yeah, well, it's tough work, you know, lying on the floor all day. I know. It's torturous. It wasn't torturous, exactly. Did you have fun? Yeah. Cool. Hey. - Hey. - How are you? Good. Can I sit down? Yeah, I was... Actually, I got to actually check my voice mail. Okay. Where's Alex? She's loading the van. I feel kind of weird about not telling Alex about what happened the other night. So... What are you talking about? Like, it feels weird keeping it a secret from her that we kissed. I'm... I'm really not sure what you're getting at here. Do you like me? Like? - Like. - Like, like you? Like, if I went like this... Look, I should... I should probably go help them out. Sorry. Yeah. No. Can I call you back in a minute? All right. Where'd everybody go? I think they just finished loading up the van. Do you want to go get some drinks with us? - Yeah. - Can I meet you there, though? I just have to finish a phone call. That's fine. - Okay. - I had fun today. Yeah, me too. Cool. All right, well, I'll see you in a bit, then? Yeah. Bye. I'll see you in, like, an hour or something. - Okay, cool. - See you. Bye. It must be kind of nice to work with the person that you're in a relationship with, kind of collaborate like that. Yeah, it's really nice. Hey. Look who it is. You guys ready to go? I'm kind of beat. Do you mind if I just go home? That's fine. Is it all right if you give me a ride before we go? I can drive you. I got my car here. It's a bit of a mess right now, but... - Okay. - Can clean it out. Is that cool? - Yeah. - All right. Have you seen Callie? Mm-mm. All right, I'll see you at home. All right. - See you. - Bye. You're lucky, you know, getting to work with your girlfriend. The fact that you guys even have something in common you can share like that, it's cool. Like, you guys are like a partnership. You're actually collaborating. - Yeah. - It's not bad. You know? Sometimes, you know, you get a little... You know, I mean, being around somebody like that all the time, it's got its minuses as well as its pluses. Yeah, but just even being able to spend that kind of time together, I think a lot of people would give a lot to find someone like that. It's nice. It's... You guys give me hope, you know? It's a nice thing. Yeah, it's good. So I take it that you don't smoke pot, then. No, no. I mean, I... I have but not for a while, not since college. Okay. Did it freak you out? I didn't enjoy it. You know, it's just one of those things where it just made me feel very self-conscious. Number 601st Avenue. 6-01st Avenue. Fuck. Isn't that the soundstage? Yeah. Shit. Alex was there when we left. All right, call her. We're gonna head straight there. Prior to getting disconnected, how did she sound on the phone? She said, "I'm fine." She was here. You know, I mean... No distress in her voice? I don't know. A little. I mean, we just broke up. He was taking photographs of my girlfriend. You son of a bitch! Let me go! It's your fault! Hey! Hey! - Hey, you calm down! - Your fault! Hey. It's really bad. He hasn't been so into someone since... Actually, probably since when he first met you. Do you want my honest opinion? I...I think so, yeah. Yeah. I think we might want to reapproach this as... some kind of a true crime book rather than a memoir. Yeah, yeah. These conversations are always difficult because this is your real life we're talking about here. I don't mean to suggest that your life is not interesting. I also don't mean to suggest that the truth can't be interesting. I just think, you know, a memoir, where the narrator, our... our, you know, hero, ends up shooting an unarmed woman and being suspended and the murders that said hero is trying to solve, you know, two of them end up being related and a third ends up being unrelated, I mean, these are just the kind of things that happen in real life but that don't necessarily make for compelling, you know, commercial books. Yeah, I... I can see that. And I think if we can just liberate you from the facts of the case and, you know, sort of free you up to tie up some of these loose ends and strengthen these connections... you and the photographer, for instance... you could strengthen up the... the kind of parallels that you seem to be suggesting here, and... and, you know, really tie these two together in some kind of cohesive, compelling way. - Yeah. - No, that's... that's a good idea. I'll think about that. What's up with this photographer? What's this guy up to? Billy? He's good. Is this all right? Yeah. My tan line looks kind of weird, but... Okay. Actually... Right there. There you go. Can you see the left hand? Maybe I should just do the right hand. - No, do... do both. - Both? Okay. That looks good, yeah. Okay. That's good. That's good. I'm gonna pull this down as well. Okay, could you just arch up just a little bit for me? - Like... - Just like... Not towards me, just, like, up, you know? Yeah, right there. There you go. Here, let me... I'm just gonna position this again real quick. Okay. Does it look weird when I, like, point my toe like that? - No. - Do that, actually. Okay. Look away or... sorry. Kind of look... look like how you are, with your head over your shoulder, but kind of be looking upwards, like, head... Yeah, like that and then eyes up is what I mean. Yeah. Yeah, like that. Okay, great. Let's just do one more. Okay. Hey. Hey, what's up? All right. Same thing, and... All right. That'll do it. Awesome. Okay. Hi. How'd it go? It was great, I think. I don't know. Was it great? Oh, it was great. - Oh, sorry. - That's okay. I'm just gonna go put this on. So how was your thing, your agent thing? Oh, yeah. I mean, he... he seems to think the book has some potential. Might have to switch a couple things around. Uh-huh. Yeah. Maybe make my character a little more proactive than I was in real life. You know, that... that may be interesting. Like you... Yeah, like, maybe actually... Like you solved the case? Yeah. How'd it go? Okay. You know, meetings with agents are always a little weird. Yeah. I mean, I don't know, but... How's it going? Hmm. It's going good. Good. Still trying to figure out the ending. I have an idea for a really good ending. - You do? - Mm-hmm. What's that? It goes like this. Mm-hmm? First... he puts down the book. Mm-hmm. Second, he takes off her shirt. That sounds like a good ending. Then she gets down. Mm, you're a better writer than me. Fourth, they turn off the light.
