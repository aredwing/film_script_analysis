Don't! Stop m - Cross! - What's the problem? Help me. She's bullying us. Bullying? You slapped me. Girls, listen up. I would like you all to meet my girlfriend, so please be nice to her. And leave her alone, okay? Come here. What are you saying? I intentionally said that to make them angrier on you. So you and your pimples will be miserable. Are you crazy? Are you stupid? Have you been taking drugs? Are you a drug addict? Oh my gosh! Here she comes. It's so not true. Witchcraft is the only explanation. Witchcraft is the only explanation... or blackmail... that is so true. Eya, we need to talk. Friend, thank goodness you came. Is it true? You could've just told me that Cross is your boyfriend. Hey, that's not true. Then why are you guys always together? This is just a secret. Don't tell anyone. I'm Cross' personal maid. What? Mex! I'm envious. What are you? Try to be that monster slash devil's personal maid. Is he that bad? Peppy, I've been looking for you. Let's talk. I can't take this anymore. Even Kuya Kim couldn't explain this. She's Cross' girlfriend and two-time cheating with Chad. What a nightmare! Peppy, you should know something about me. What is it? Oh my god, is this real? I want to believe I'm beautiful. Peppy, I can't hold this anymore. I need to quench my thirst. I'm a vampire. You're so annoying. Hey, best friend, don't be irritated. What do you mean best friend? Are we close? Best friend, it's Lory's birthday tomorrow. I need you with my plan, please. What is your dark plan for my best friend? Best friend, relax. Here's my plan. When the lights turn off at 12 midnight, I'll get Lory's hand. And I'll take her to the garden. And there I'll give her the ring. Then I'll ask her to be my girlfriend. That's sweet, right? You've already iron out your plan, you don't have to get me involved. Wait. This is where you come in. Make sure you'll give this to Lory. And make her wear it. Co'z it has a tracker inside. That way I can tell that it's her. You're giving yourself a hard time. Why don't you just propose in the middle of the party? Of course it's more dramatic when it's dark. Then, I'll grab her like there's a kidnap scene. Sweet. Thanks, Peppy- Guess, what? I love you! - Thank you! - Chad! Thank you, thank you. You're so kind. You stink. To infinity and beyond! Eya! Be thankful I've taken you here. Hello, I'm invited, too. - Hey, what's up? - Hey bro. You got a date. What? No! She's my personal maid. I'm Ian and you're Eya. Sorry about my best friend. He seemed to be mad at the world. I'm used to him. Is he really like that since birth? I think it started when his mom died. He really made his mom the reason behind this. I'm an orphan. Nothing. Party! Party! Party! Bro, let's go. What's this? Can I get a lot? Thank you. Now that's gluttony. O Chad. O by the way, you take care of it. Sorry. Did you see Lory. Sorry, no. Lory? Lory! Joke, sorry. Lory! Lory, somebody wants to give this to you. Listen well. Let me finish first before you speak. I know that you already love somebody else. But believe me, he's not worth it. I love you very much. Give me a chance to love you. Be my girlfriend. Dude, are you 95V? Chad? Cross? This is so embarrassing. Chad! You ruined everything. That's enough. That's enough. Hey, Eya, whom are you talking with? No one Auntie. Crazy. Auntie, I was just dreaming. Hey, how many times did I tell you that you should stop creating those fantasies. You should keep your feet on the reality. Even if I'm dreaming, Auntie, your role is to wake me up. Eya, you're already an orphan. You should know how to deal with life. Where will you go when I'm already gone? Why, Auntie? Where are you going? Oh, nowhere. Sorry. You know dogs are mad at cats. Cat? Do I look like a cat? Wh? did you go here? I waited for you co'z I know you're on your way home. Here's for you. Use that, okay? What's this? It's just something. I bet, Cross has been insulting you. You know, the first time I saw you, I knew you have a good personality. You went all the way here to give me a tribute. Ian... He's like a drug addict. I'm so... Eya, we need to talk. Can we do that next time? Ba-bye! What's your problem? Are you blind? I just saw a ghost. Wait, ghost? Yes. Ghost MN'! ' Who's Mary? Mary, the one who appears at the student council room. It was said that she was raped. White lady. What? Are you kidding me? Kidding? If you want, we can look for her. Wait. Later. Go to student council room. I got a meeting there. You're the one who has a meeting yet you're asking me to get there. Maybe you're scared. I want you to go there co'z I want my personal maid to be there. If you won't show up, I'll get my hands on you. If you won't show up, I'll get my hands on you. Yo, guys, sit down. Hi, Cross. Hi, bro. And now we can start. Hi, guys. As you all know, we have a school fair coming up soon. We need ideas now. Bye! Bye. 5Y9, guys. Bye, thank you. Cross, I'll go ahead. What? You still need to fill out the forms. I'll just do that at home. You won't need it tomorrow, right? No, let's finish it. It's my parent's anniversary. We've got family dinner. Why? Are you scared to be alone? No. Why would I be scared? Okay, I'll be the one to do it then I'll email it to you. That's okay. Okay. I'll kill that Pimples. The subscriber cannot be reached. Please try again later. Who are you? Go away. Mommy! Eya, where are you? Mommy! These kids don'! know how to lock the door. Hey, wake up. Did you see Mary? Who's Mary? The white lady. That's not true. I just made that up. No, I saw her. That's just me. The one I saw doesn't have pimples. You know, for a monster, you're a coward. Admit it. You're scared. Shut up. You're fired. Your dad's the one who's paying me. So, your dad is the only one who can fire me. Let's go. It's locked. Why did you lock it? I didn't. Call the school guard. I don't have a load. What? That's incredible. Co'z you're a beggar. Poorest of the poor. And 119W- Why don't you make the phone call. I got no charge. I didn't bring my charger. Gorgeous rich kid with a postpaid line. No charger. Amazing. Is that you? No. Get off there. That's my place. Move. Get your own place. Get off there. She can't be reached now that she's needed. Wait 'til I get my hands on her. Let's sleep. No. Just talk to me first. What are we gonna talk about? Tell me something about you. What do you want to know? Why are you ugly? Where are you hiding your horn and tail? Why are you poor'? Co'z I don't have parents. Where are your parents? They died in an accident when I was 14. You? Where's your mom? She died in a plane crash when I was 5. That's why you're like that. What am I? Nothing. Like that. You're lucky you still have a dad. Go to sleep. Okay, sleep then. Hey, what are you doing here? Go home. Don? you have classes? Fm gonna tell them about this. Sorry. Sorry. Here, it's done.

He wouldn't let Chad court her. Who's Cross' love? Maybe just himself. He left early. My boss has a good heart. Damn. He played connect the dots on my face! He must've used indelible ink. I see the star. I see the moon. I know who owns that. Coach, can I take a break? Okay 30 minutes. Eya! We need to talk. Please forgive me. Are you gonna kill me? Have mercy on me. Peppy! Peppy, relax. I'm not mad. You're mad. You said, "You ruined everything." Peppy, I know you didn't like what happened. But let's just forget it. Peace? Smells like Chad. He's so nice. He let me borrow his shirt. When you're done hugging yourself, go see your boss. Okay. Yes. UQW, is that you? This is me, monster. What did you say? Monster! Only monsters like you are capable of drawing on my face. Sorry. So it's your face. I thought connect the dots. I'll kill you, you monster! Get off me. Wait, why are you hot? Did you just come in from sauna? Forget it. Just leave. Your fever is high. Stay there. I'll get a medicine. Stay there. If you have a plan of poisoning Cross, I'll understand. But have fear in God. I don't want to go to hell. I might see him there. It might contain poison. It doesn't have poison. Come on. You're sweating. Take off your clothes. Go change. I don't like. You might rape me. Take care of yourself. You're big enough. What do you want, cookie monster? I can't sleep. Turn off the aircon. What else? Water. We'll take you to the hospital. I'd rather die than go to the hospital. What do you want? Go straight to the morgue? Okay, wake up the driver. I'll go to the hospital. Don't come. We'll just go. Eya, I know you have classes tomorrow. But can you make an absence? Okay. Cross needs to be accompanied in the hospital. He doesn't want me to come. Don't take whatever he says on face value. My son has a lot of differences. Why is that? He wants to show everyone that he doesn't need anyone. But he keeps on asking me to do a lot of things for him. You know, my son has a lot of hang-ups. What are you doing here? I told you so. I've talked to your doctor. You have an intestinal flu. I'm okay. Let's wait for the attending physician. Let her tell us that. If you need anything, call me.

Come with me Eya. You take care of Cross. okay- Ian, why did you give me those skin care products? I want you have smooth skin. Are you a dermatologist? Or you're practicing on me. Nothing. I just want your skin to be smooth. So you'd be pretty. Wow you're nice. Just like a fairy godmother. So Cross would notice you. Co'z you two match. You're crazier than your friend. It's like this. Cross is my friend. I know him better. He's kind. He just doesn't want to show it. No. Leave the lights on. Hey ugly. Are you still up? Sleeping- Ugly, come here. Sleep beside me. Ugly! I don't like. You can't even say "please". E ya. Please. Move. Wait. - Move. I want to sleep now. - Hold it. Come on. I'll just check your IV. Ouch. You didn't do it gently. You knew it's tight. You just forced me. Hi, Miss. I want you to know that this is a hospital not a motel. Ma... mommy. Don't leave me. - He's cute when he's playing coward. - Don't... Even a monster has a heart. Sleep now. I'm just here. Chad! Come on. Lory and I will have lunch. Come with us. - No. - Let's go. She's avoiding me. That's why I'm taking you with me so you could talk to her. Calm down. Lory, I took Chad with me. We'll have lunch with him. Oh dear. I forgot. I still have something to do. Sorry. Eya, we're going somewhere later. Where? Surprise. Better go. Bye! Go after her. Next time, Peppy, let me do the strategy. I'll just wait for you outside. No, come. It's my beauty treatment day today. I don't have beauty to be treated. Come on now, don't be silly. Good afternoon, Miss Lory. The usual? Yes but it's gonna be the two of us. Wow! I didn't know that aside from SSS and PAG-IBIG benefits... your maid is entitled for a salon treatment. She's not my maid. She's my best friend. I'm sorry. Miss Julie, can you please attend to Miss Lory and her best friend. This way, ma'am. I'm pretty. Like us? Wow. - 12,000. - Lory, how much is it? Don't worry, this one's on me. And that is because you look gorgeous. They have to see you like that in the legendary ball of Willford. What's that? It's a masquerade ball. We're gonna wear a mask, then why do we have to make ourselves beautiful. We have to make ourselves pretty co'z there's gonna be a rigodon of dances. And at 12 midnight, whoever you're dancing with, he'll be your special someone. That's corny. It's not if I'll be with Cross. I'll do what I can to be close to him. I don't know what's in him that you like him a lot. Cross is my classmate since elementary. And because I was a transferee, I always get bullied. And Cross was there. He was my knight in shining armor. He always stood up for me. This monster has a secret kindness. Are you sure it's Cross? Maybe that's someone who has the same name as his. Hey, Chad. This is me Eya. PePPY- I know. Wow. I mean I need you. Come with me. Where are we going? Just somewhere. Hi, Chad. Hey. Don't you think Eya's so gorgeous? What? Eya? No, that's just hot oil. Admit it. You had a plastic surgery. Admit it. You had a brain surgery. Let's go gorgeous. Nice one. You're good at baking. Sorry. The cupcakes turned out just enough. I won't be able to make you taste it. It's okay. I'm full already just by smelling it. Hey, Peppy. Please give this to Lory. You're so sweet. Lory's lucky with you. But the guy who will love you is luckier. Who are you? What are you doing here? Why are you opening the ref. Are you a thief? Thief! 'Day. Don't be OA. If I were a thief, I'd go straight to the rooms not in the kitchen. Manang! Manang look at Eya! Eya? What did you do? Did you see a witch doctor? Hello. That's just soap and water. Where can I get that soap and water? Yes. Where can we buy that soap and water... That's enough. It would be better for you to go upstairs... because your boss is throwing tantrums again. Okay. Manang, I'll just put these cupcakes here. Can I have some? No, you can't. Even I haven't tasted it. Get me soap and water immediately. What can I do for you? Why are you late, ugly? In fairness with you, you're the only one who didn't notice. Why? Nothing. What can I do for you, your highness? Clean all of these. Now. What will I do with these papers? I'll gather or throw it? Throw. Then throw. Okay, you're pretty. You look good. Ugly, I'm hungry'- Ugly! No! What? I bit it already. Why did you touch that? It's in my ref. And my house. So unless told otherwise, what's in there are all mine. I just place it there temporarily. Sorry. Finders keepers. Losers suck. It tastes good. That's mine. It's mine. - Let go. - Let it go! Let it go. Look what you did. Then just buy again. Buy? Those are special. Those are made for a special person. You can't buy it. What do you want me to do? Nothing. Get out of my way. You're gonna kill me because of cupcakes? Yes. Come here! Eya! Don't. What is that? Stop it. Eya, stop it. What is your problem? Why did you eat my cupcakes? I'll kill you. Stop it. Stop! You're going to hurt yourself. Right. Good evening, Sir. Eya, you look different. I didn't know it's you. You look good. Sir, I'm sorry. I can't take your son anymore. Before he's just half human, half monster. Now he's a 100% monster. I can't promise that I can take him next but thanks for the compliment. Cross, come to my office. Cross! Crazy! Are you okay? Yes. Good for you. What happened? It's not important. I will let you leave if you tell me. It's just the stupid cupcakes. For you those are just stupid cupcakes. You know, not everyone are born like you. You have everything. That's why sometimes you don't put value... in simple things that are priceless to others. I know what you mean. Do you? These are special memories with your mother. Look, they're priceless. But they're very special. Now tell me, what will you do if someone tear it apart? I hope you apologize to her. No poison, come on. Out! Out! Hey, It's not gonna ring again. Okay. Get back! Hurry. Go, go! - Mary... 0 Mary! - Shut up. I said shut up! Who are you whispering with? Her. Mary! Where? Move. Wait. - Move. I want to sleep now. - Wait. Come on. Arlene is on number 3. You on 7. Good evenin, Sir. I'll get your order. Yes. One order of Eya. Extra ugly. What are you doing here? You're working here? What a coincidence... Will you please leave? Just so you can annoy someone, huh. Come here. Go with him. I don? like. He gave me 5 thou. Do you want me to give you some portion of it. What am I Auntie? A GHQ? Do I have a cut on drinks?

Hey, I'm trying to be nice. For once. Come on. Say ah... Say ah... What the...? Water! What the...? What do you want? Did you take drugs? I'm at peace here. And then you came to ruin it. What? Nothing. Come with me. I resigned already. Sorry. What did you say? What? I'm sorry. Can you be more sincere? Eya, I'm sorry. Come on. I'm gonna late. Let's go. Damn it. I left my planner in the room. What do you want? You'll go on your own or I'll come with you? I'll go alone. You might lock the door again. Feeling. Keep quiet. Shut up. Boss, let's seal her mouth with a tape. Brod, we don't have duct tape. I left it in the condo. Hey pesky people who likes to pose. Just shut her up. I don't know how you became Cross' girlfriend, ugly loud mouth. Let me go. Wow. You speak English. Yet you left your duct tape. And please can you take off your mask. I know who you are. I'm not Cross' girlfriend. So please let me go and let's all forget this... - Sit! - Ouch! That hurts. This is not a joke. We kidnapped you to get even with Cross. Our girlfriends left the two of us because of him. If Cross comes over here for you, we'll beat him 'til he gets ugly, and no one will like him anymore. And I'll be the school's heartthrob. What? Really? I'm not Cross' girlfriend. Don't deny it. You've been under surveillance for a long time. We've asked someone to follow you 'til you get to his house. - Because... Ouch! - Hello! Cross. What? - You don't know me but we have... - I don't know you... I don't talk to strangers. He put it down. I'm his personal maid that's why we're always together. So please? Stop this drama. Shut up! Shut up! I can't think in here. - Wait I'm thinking. - E ya! Meow! Eya? - What's that? - Meow... Eya? They'll think that there are cats here not persons. Meow... meow... Eya! Chad! Eya? To your back, Chad! Hurry! It's Chad! Let's take pictures. Idol. Easy. Jump shot. Okay. One, two, three... Okay. Fist bump! Hey, Chad. I might take all your... Sorry. YOU can come OUI HOW. I'm presentable. You know, you are so... Sorry. My abs might have startled you. Sir snacks. Thank you, manang. Here, have some snacks. I baked this. Really? Did you bake this? Yes. It's for Lory. But she told me to stop chasing her already. She wouldn't like me. It's Cross that she really likes. What's wrong with me? Nothing. You're gorgeous. Good soccer player. Great baker. Friendly, kind. If I were Lory, I'd choose you. I even got a big crush on you. Really? Joke. So what's your plan? Don't be sad. That's the way it goes. We can't always get what we want. H feels good to have an illusion. But you'll get tired eventually with all the fantasies. Sometimes you have to wake up with reality. Chad is so cute. If we weren't having this platonic relationship, I'd court him. He's crying? What's this ? E verytime I have a bed scene with boys, it's either they threw up on me or they're crying. Peppy? Yes, best friend? I'm gonna tell you something. But don't get mad or irritated, okay? Can you please sit properly co'z I can see your panty. I'll just wear my skirt. Sorry. What are you doing here? This is my house. I can do what I want. Don't touch me. Let me go! I always wanted to do this. - No! - Let her go! You can't kiss her. Chad, you're my hero! Because you should be kissing me. Hold her fight. Man-mg, when are you doing'? Whoever you are, leave Eya's body. Leave! Manang, I was just dreaming. This is not exorcist, Manang. That's what they always say. Don't, Manang. No! Oh no, when Cross is being nice, you can be in... I don? know. Ma, Pa, do you know... your daughter is flirting. I've met a few friends in Willford. Lory, then Chad... He's my crush but I got to forget it co'z I know I don't stand a chance. Cross is like a monster. He's annoying and cruel. A snob. His good side is that he knows now how to say sorry. He's weird when he's scared of the ghost. Really? Are you stalking me? - It's raining. Come on. - Jesus. Let's go! My bag! - Come on. - Let's go. Let's go. Here. - Here. Where are you going? - Here. Hurry. The rain ruined my moment. Because you're ugly. Where's your car? I asked the driver for an errand. What is that? Then call him. I left my charger in the car. Your cellphone? I don't have load. You're getting a big salary yet you're still poor. What are you doing here? I'm visiting my mom's grave. Does her remains lie in here, too? Are you crying? That's rain. You're crying. Look. Yes. I feel sad. I miss my mom. When she died, I cried a lot. That's why I'm so destructive. That's why I feel so angry. Maybe that's why I'm punishing everyone because I'm miserable. I want everyone to be like me. True. Here. What's that? What are you doing? So you'd feel warm. That's wet too. So you'd be a bit warm. There. Come here. Body heat. What? Body heat. I don't like. Come here. Come here. You might get sick. Dad would have to spend money for you. Come here. Don't act up. You're not pretty. Ifs okay 10 be ugly if Pd be hugging someone like him. H makes me feel pretty big time. Eya! You look pretty. Are you looking for Cross? What? What? No. You, too. You don't want to admit it. Really. He's in the stock room. With Miss UK. Lory? Why'd you know that? Lory asked for my help so they'd be close. So there, I locked them up. Are you jealous? No. I even want to help Lory. Let's go check them out. Slow down. Listen. Cross, I love you. Sorry but I'm already in a relationship. With whom? With Eya. No. No. No. Eya told me it was a joke. She told me the truth. She told me that you just said that so the girls would get mad at her. No. It's really true. I already love her. I always want to see her. Stop. Even in my dreams. Wait, I'll open this. I don? believe you. - Hurry. - Ouch. Is it true? I'll take care of her. Why did you tell her that? I can't think of any way so she'd stop chasing me. Hey, don't react like you're the one who's embarrassed. Don't you really like her? You're stubborn. Weren't you the one who want to push her with Chad. I thought you're the Lorhad villain. What? Lorhad. Lory, Chad. Lorhad. Whatever. I'm tired. Hello, I'm busy. Go to the wedding booth. Now. Okay, wait. I'll just frighten one more. Wait. Hello. Do you want to have your team Lorhad succeed? Okay. Jesus! You're so annoying. You're good even without costume. You're still scary. You asked me to go here just to be insulted at. You wanna make this convincing? Let's get married. I can? understand what he wants. But ifs okay. In the name of love. Okay. Forced? Me? No. Before we get married, fix your face. Choosy. Do you, Cross Sandford, take Rea Rodriguez as your lawfully wedded wife? I do. You may now kiss the bride. Hey you, don't take advantage. You should take advantage. For sure Lory's out there. Looking. She'll catch you. For the sake of art and in the name of love. More. You can use me as your tissue right now. Feel free to blow your nose or wipe your tears on me. I don't care if you throw me the trash when you're done. As long as I'm useful to you, Lory. Just let me wipe your tears. I saw Cross and Eya kiss. Chad, they're a couple. That hurts. Lory, trust me when I tell you, I know how it feels. I really do. Just go away. - You can't do anything to help me. - Lory... it's okay. I'm here, Lory. It's okay. Lory, it's okay. I'm here for you, Lory. It's okay. You're crying harder than Lory, huh. Come on. Oh ma'am sorry, you can't. There's a line... You're all OA. Party POOP- Let's go. Eya. Eya, Are you in-love with Cross? Why are you asking? Answer me first. Are you in-love with Cross? Yes, Lory. I love Cross. I'm hurt, Eya. I felt bad with what I saw in the Marriage Booth. But you know what? It made me realize one thing. That I look stupid. I'm waiting for someone who will never ever like me. Then I saw Chad. Chad's there for me. Cares for me. Do you think I should give Chad a chance? You know, the two of you look good together, promise. I'll give Chad a chance. As long as you promise to take care of Cross for me. Why is there a lot of OAs here? Sorry. Good luck to us. Thank you, best friend. Let's go? Hi! Hi! I'm going crazy. I think I should describe this feeling as love. I've never felt this way before. Can you really fall for someone you love to hate? I don't know. I'm not sure about myself anymore. For once I wanna be honest. Do the right thing. There's something I have to tell you. L... I like you. What if you smell him? Then look for the one who smells like him. You're gross. Well, I hope this helps. We'll go look find him. Thank you. I like you. I like you. I like you. I like you. How many matched? 4 shoes. Not one for the voice. Then choose. The voice of whom I talked with last night is different. Are we done, sis? Why do we have that? Hello? Hello, E ya. This is Adrian. Hi! How did you know me? I've actually been stalking you ever since the start of the sem... I know I goi chicken out but I found the strength... to actually express my feelings to you at the ball... co'z I have the mask. I like you. It's you. Fm afraid you might not like me. Can I meet you after class. Okay. Alright. Bye. Yes, hello. Hello, E ya. Where are you? Ah Adrian, hold on. - Wait. - Okay. What? Can you go here at the Student Council room? I can't. Why? Are you gonna look for that boy first than your job that pays you? I'm going home. I got LBM. There are a lot of CRs here. My butt isn't used to them. Eya. Hello, Adrian, sorry about it. My friend is so pesky. He keeps on calling me. Sorry. No problem. So I'll meet you after school. Okay, see you. Bye. Thank you Lord. This is it. This is real. Finally, somebody's gonna love me. I can finally be happy. Hey; Eva' I'm Adrian. Hey, Adrian. I'm Cross. What are you doing here? Are you really Eya's partner? Why are you asking? Do you have doubts? So then, who's her partner? Not you. Stop it. Stop it. This is but my only chance to feel happy and you want to ruin it. Okay. Alright guys. I give up. I can? do this anymore. It's not me. Ian made me do it. Why? To make him feel jealous. And to make him tell the truth. So just let me go, I won't be a big MH to the two of you. No. The voice is different. I got sore throat that night. I got colds. After it rained, remember? You? I can't explain but... Why do you have this? What would you expect me? Leave it lying around the house? You read it? Yes. Read the last page. I know what's written here. I'm the one who's writing here. Read it. Hey diary of the ugly E ya. It's morning and! can't sleep. co': Eya's my partner in the midnight party... I know she was the girl behind the mask. My heartbeat went fast. This is weird but... Why am I like this? Maybe this started when we got together in the hospital. Or at the student council room. I always want to be with her. See her. Talk to her. And as days go by, my feelings for he! get stronger. I was able to tell her what I feel at the ball. She's not my type. She's not even pretty. But she makes my world beautiful. Damn B... I like her. Hey, ugly, speak up. Listen. Are you better off writing your fantasies? Or do you want to give a chance... our true feelings. A... e... I... O... U... Eya, will you be my girlfriend? Yes. Life is like a book. Or maybe a diary. Ifs in your hands how you want to end H.
