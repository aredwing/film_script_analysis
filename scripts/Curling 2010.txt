If you want me to help you see and work better, you have to tell me if it's hard for you. I don't go to school. You don't go to school. No. Never ever? I don't go. Well then. I'm going to ask your father to come in. And we'll explain what we've found wrong with your eyes, OK? Stay put. Mr. Sauvageau? Well, Mr. Sauvageau, there's a minor problem with Julyvonne's eyes. It should have been identified and corrected before now. It seems that Julyvonne doesn't attend school. Is that true? That's our business, sir. Julyvonne has astigmatism and it needs to be monitored. Why couldn't I get contact lenses? Everybody has them. The optometrist said you have the stigmatism. You can't have contacts with that. Your glasses suit you well. No need to be like everyone else. You'll be a bit different. That's all. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon. Is everything all right? What's wrong? Where are you headed? - Home. - On foot? Yes, on foot. Is this your daughter? - Yes, she's my daughter. - Right. It seems a bit chilly to be out walking on the side of the road. That's our problem, not yours. Do you have a car? Yes, I do. You just didn't drive it today? That's right. A little weekend stroll. You like to feel the cold biting at your cheeks, do you? That's right. Good for the health. Would you like a ride? You live nearby? We don't need a ride. We live nearby. What do you have in your bags? Food. Food? Can I have your names? Jean-Francois and Julyvonne Sauvageau. Right... We should go to the store more often. We'd see people. We would. Right. You should go to sleep soon. No. I'll go when you go. I'm old enough. You'll go to sleep, OK? Works every time. I won 16 to 4 yesterday. It was crazy! The machine's no match for me. The console burst into flames, goddamn it! Oh yeah? There are a few scratches in Lane 22, Moustache. - Go have a look. - OK, sure. What do you get out of playing video games at your age? What do you know about it, Mr. Sporty? Leave me to my simple pleasures. Goddamn it. Come see me in my office later. - I have something for you. - Sure. - Hello. - Wow! That's what I like! A new girl? Yeah. Isabelle. She's not bad, eh? Come on. You're more than twice her age. You jealous? Forget the mathematics. She's cute. Real cute. That's all. She speaks Spanish. And she can read your fortune in your coffee cup. Get out of here. I'm telling you. She's a magician. She dresses herself up like a Christmas tree, but it'll make for a good show. It'll give us something to look at besides the chip rack. You wanted to see me? Yeah. Moustache, you're gonna love me. My sister-in-law was by yesterday. I told her about you quick, quick. Why? What do you mean ''why''? You're always alone. I'm just trying to find you some fun. I never asked you to. You're trying to set me up? You never do anything. Collect trinkets, go bird-watching. Do something! What do you mean ''do something''? Birds are boring. Find a hobby. When I was a kid, I was into trains. I used to set up the tracks in the basement. My dog kept walking on them. At a certain point, I got over it and I moved on. - That's it, isn't it? - What's it? You moved on. Hey, I like that! What? You're starting to talk back. I like that. Now we can start having some fun around here! Hello, Madame Odile? I'm in Room 1 1. Did something happen? Well, there's blood everywhere. There's blood everywhere. OK, sure. Holy fuck! That's gonna leave a stain. He was a big Acadian trucker. Oh yeah? I'll call Yvan. We'll see what he has to say. I can try to clean up the worst. No, don't bother with it. Leave it the way it is. Go do Room 9, then come see me. I have to talk to you, darlin'. Is it worth calling the police? No, no, no, no. I think you've noticed there's never anyone here. Yeah, but... that's normal for winter, isn't it? We're closing. I don't have the energy. Closing... Closing, closing? Yeah. Yvan's gonna board up the windows. But... In the summer, you'll open back up again, right? If not, maybe you could sell the place to someone else? Sorry, that's just the way it is. Can we go see Rosie? You want to go see Rosie? Yeah. It's been a long time. Well, I... I don't really feel like it. I don't know. Maybe someday. I'll think about it. Hello? Hello? Hello? Who is it? There's no talking, just breathing. Give it to me. Hello? Nobody's there. No, listen. Someone's there. They're breathing. Do you want to put some music on? Is there any dessert? Not today. But I cleaned the cupboards and you're happy with it. Yes, I'm happy with it. That's why we can put some music on. But there's no dessert. Hey, kid, what are you doing here? I'm building a fort. Where do you live? Over there. On the other side of the garage. It's awfully early to be building a fort. Are you alone? I'm going to school. Well, go to school then. Don't hang around our place. Why not? Because you don't live here. And you should be in school. Anyway, this snow isn't any good for a fort. The plough's gonna come through and destroy your fort. I'm far away from the road. Well then I'm gonna destroy it. Go on! Get going! Go on! The loser cleans the toilet. I'm really not very good. No problem. You'll see. It's really easy. Come on. Relax a little. When you get to the end, you let go of the ball. You wanted to play. Right, that's it. I wanted to play. You don't bring your daughter bowling anymore. Bring her. She can play with Isabelle. I'm not so sure about that. It wasn't safe for her here last time. Come on, you moron! What's not safe around here? She's not 5 anymore. Are you shy? You don't talk much. I talk. - I'm Isabelle. - Yeah. Your name is Jean-Francois? Yes. Kennedy's cleaning the toilets. Yeah. Do you bowl? Not a lot, no. It gets boring after a while. You don't have to be shy with me. You haven't been here long? No. I think it'll be just for a couple of months. Kennedy's my mother's cousin. You smoke? No. Well, now and again. When I'm stressed. Are you a stressed kinda guy? I smoke now and again. You've got some look. - Kennedy likes it. - Does he? Yeah. He says it turns him on and I can dress as I like. It's not your style? It's different. I think you'll be happy. I brought you back some nice stuff. A math book, a comic book, a book about polar bears, and a book about the history of Quebec. But you'll see, it's not too hard. Happy? Hey, what's wrong? Can we go see Rosie? We'll try to go Friday, maybe. That's a better time. There's not as many people. Why do you want to see Rosie so bad? You want a cup of tea? We'll look at the history book. A nice cup of tea. No, I'm going to my room. You want me to make breakfast for supper tonight? Sure I have the right. If I can prove I'm educating her myself. And you educate her? Of course. But for Christ's sake... That little girl must surely need something more, doesn't she? You in a cult or something? No, I'm not in a cult. She's well looked after. Holy crap, Moustache! You're something else. When did you decide that? She's never been. Christ almighty! I don't like the idea of her being in school with all kinds of sorts up to all kinds of no good. Didn't you ever try to send her? Just to see? No. You're the kind of fool who dives into a lake to get out of the rain. What? What do you mean ''what''? Your lake-in-the-rain thing. It's an expression. Forget it. I'd rather dive into a snow bank than have to listen to your nonsense. Goddamn it, J.F.! You dive into a lake to get out of the rain. He doesn't want to get wet in the rain! How old is your little girl? Twelve. What are you scared of? Wha'? What are you scared of? I'm not scared of anything. You're scared of her going to school, but you leave her alone every day? She knows what she can and can't do. We have very strict rules at home. She respects me. We respect each other. And it all works out. She's really happy. It was hot in those damn rooms in the summer anyway. We're starting to realize now. All that talk about heating the planet and stuff. We're stuck with it. Darlin', come play with us on Sunday. I can't. I've got things to do. Well, then come watch. You'll see, once you get a taste for it. And bring your daughter. She'll love it! No, she'd be bored. Come on! We'll see. Hey! What are you doing? I knew it was you! It's dangerous at night, Julyvonne! - No, it's not! Nobody's around! - Yes, it is! You were supposed to be asleep a long time ago! Goddamn it! Don't swear! Get in the car. I never said you were allowed to walk on the road at night! It's dangerous, Julyvonne! We're lucky to live quietly in our house. Outside, it's not... I don't want my girl to get caught up in no good like that. I know you get it. If you listen to me, you'll be responsible. You'll thank me. Darlin'! Come and play with us! No, I'll slip and crack my skull. But you'll freeze sitting there, not playing. I'm fine. It's not that cold. Yvan's not playing? Oh no! My handsome champion! Champion! His arthritis is acting up. He's just watching? He is, just like you. He's watching. I think he's here to check out the grannies. And strut his stuff and have a bit of fun. Strut his stuff? Yeah, his knee. How's it work? It's about getting the rock closest to the middle? You try to get it close to the centre. That's where the points are. The first one to play, the lead, his job is to put the stones just in front of the house. Those are called guards. What's the house? Is it... The house is the rings, over there. When the others play, they have to go around it. See the guy there, with his broom? He says: ''This is the line, ''throw it like that and curl it around.'' And the sweepers, what are they doing? Did you see that? Look. The sweeping warms the ice a little so that it slides better. Does it really work? But you don't always have to. It depends how hard you throw. You saw the last one? He threw it hard. He hit the rock dead on and made the takeout. Are there special shoes? Or can you wear anything you want? The shoes have a small Teflon slider underneath. They put them out. You pick from the pile. - So you have to buy shoes? - There's small, medium and large. Everything you need. Looks like fun. I knew you'd be interested, you rascal. Check this out. Can you believe it? We'll interest him in something yet. Hello? Hey! Are you OK? Where are you hurt? Can you talk? It's going to be all right. It'll be all right. There you go. It's going to be all right. You'll be fine, OK? You OK? Come on! You OK? You OK? You all right? Goddamn it! Come on! Where were you? I had a problem with the car. You OK? Yes. Are you going to sleep? I'm going to smoke a cigarette and then I'm off to bed. I'd like to paint the bathroom. What colour would you like? Red. Red isn't a bathroom colour, Julyvonne. You wouldn't like green? No, red. Are your glasses comfortable? Shall I take you to the bowling alley and the motel today? And we'll go see Rosie in the afternoon. All right! You can do it! Go for it! Good, Marie! Good throw! Yeah! Keep it up. Way to go! Are you the one who's calling? You should just say something instead of just breathing, worrying Julyvonne. I won't call anymore. What's with you? Do you miss me? She's the one who wanted to see you, not me. If you've got nothing else to say, just send her in. What's new? Don't pretend you give a damn. You can go. It's down at the end there. I went to the bathroom. It was painted red. We can do the same thing at home. Go ahead. She wants to see you. Get going! You're so pretty, sweetheart. Is everything OK with your dad? Yes. Is he nice to you? Does he feed you well? Yes. What do you do together? Does he help you with your homework? I'd like him to paint the bathroom. That's a great idea, sweetheart. Your hair is long. You have everything you need at home? You swear? I'm fine. Rosie, I saw a tiger. - What? - I saw a tiger. What do you mean a tiger? Where? In a field. You'd tell me if anything was wrong? I can't talk long. Ask your father to come back, OK? She's not right, that little girl. There's nothing in her eyes. What do you mean? She's completely empty. She's practically retarded. It's obvious. She's fine. You don't know anything about her. I know you. You're afraid of everything. You hide from everyone. You control everything. It's not good for her! She doesn't even know you. I don't even know why she wants to see you. You don't love her. She doesn't love you either. You don't need a degree to figure that much out. Right, I'm leaving now. I'll get out of here one day. If you touch a hair on her head, I'll rip your fucking heart out! Do you understand? Do you understand? CLOSED Miss your job that much? Hey, Yvan. How are you? Good, you? Yeah, good. I was just passing. So, pretty much all done here? Yeah, I forgot a couple of tools and I had to pick up the mail. You want to come in for a coffee? No, I'm gonna keep walking. Hold on. Cold's deep down in my goddamn bones this year. How about you? No, I'm fine with it. Odile's not around? No, she's at the hairdresser's. She's coming for me later. - OK, right. - Check this out! Five inches. Look. A good-sized buck. Two, three years old. Oh yeah? How do you know that? Easy. Three inches is a baby, usually. Four inches is a young doe. More than 5 inches is a buck. And this is... Yup, over 5 inches. And fresh. You don't miss the motel? Hell no. You're never gonna take those boards down again? Nope. I want nothing more to do with those stinking rooms. Fuck. Yeah, you're pushing your luck, Moustache. Sorry. You're better at this than I am. I ended up having to push it last night in the freezing cold. Cry me a river why don't you? Get rid of this lemon, would ya? No car, no cell phone, no Internet, no TV, no girlfriend, no fun. What's with the cops? Must be about the little boy they're looking for. They were talking about it on the news. Did the cops come see you? I don't have anything to say. I didn't ask what size shorts you wear, just if the cops came by. OK, try it now so I can hear what the problem is. OK, stop! - I'm going to go see Julyvonne. - Better not. She's sick. You'll catch her bug. There, Moustache. It should start now. I'm gonna go take a leak. Hello, cutie pie. I'm just coming in. Gotta adjust my rug. Where's the bathroom? Hey! I missed them all. - Everything OK? - Sure. You? Yeah. My boyfriend's coming by soon to eat with us. Maybe you can meet him. OK, sure. You have a boyfriend? Yeah. How old is he? Twenty-five. You love him? He's all right. You look funny in your costume. Oh yeah? Yeah, you're cool. I hear you read fortunes in people's coffee cups. No, I don't. Did Kennedy tell you that? Yeah. I could make him believe anything. He said you spoke Spanish, too. Yeah. Well, a little. Oh yeah? Say something to me. Wow! That sounds nice. What does it mean? Well, basically, it means I'm happy I know you. You've had sad eyes now for a while. If something's wrong, you can tell me. Well... I'm not well. Can I do anything? It'll pass. No, talk to me. Get it off your chest. No, I'm all right. Well... - See you later. - Sure. Check it out! Daddy, Isabelle said there are kids like me who play here on Sundays. Can I play with them? We'll see. She says a lot of things, that girl! Please, I'd like to come? Don't bother me. I'm working. Look, Kennedy's about to throw the ball. - How many pins fell? - Six. Close your eyes. Take the number of pins still standing and add nine. How many is that? That's hard. Use your head. You should be able to figure that out, no problem. OK, go have some fun. I'm hot. Go! - Give me your head! - Hey, whoa! Who are you? - Give me your head! - Whoa! You want my head? I'll give it to you. How old are you? Ten. - You go to school? - Yes! Get down from there. Are you good at school? What's four times three? Easy. Twelve! Six times five? Thirty! Twenty divided by four? - Five. - Get down from there! Hey! Jesus! So, Moustache, not too hot? Not bad. I went for a leak before. And it took me 10 minutes just to get the costume off. Julyvonne is having the time of her life. Tell her she can eat whatever she wants. My treat. Thanks. Don't pout. You lost the bet. That's it. Isabelle's fleabag of a boyfriend did it yesterday and it didn't kill him. It's only a costume. It's nothing to be humiliated about. I've scrapped the draw for the toboggan. There are fewer people than I'd hoped. It'll look cheap. I've kept it for you in the office, for Julyvonne. Thanks. That's real nice of you. She'll be so happy. Good! Now lose the long face. It's a party, not a funeral. Did you like that today? Yeah. You leaving the bags on the counter? I'm tired. Go to sleep. Dad? Are you going to bed? Julyvonne, come here, OK? Sit down. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I need a break. Why? You're not taking me with you? I'm leaving with the car. No, I'm not taking you with me. Why? When are you coming back? Julyvonne, you're going to stay here. That's our deal, between you and me. You need to be a big girl. Can't you tell me why? I have a grown-up problem. I'm gonna go. Just between you and me, OK? Why? I'm not so good in my head. I know that you're able to stay here alone. Can you understand that? Yes, but... why? Stop asking me why. That's the way it is. Good shot! Hello. Hello. You expecting someone? Um, no, no. My name's Mireille. I saw you at the motel next door. Are you a tourist? Yeah, yes, that's it. Where are you from? Saint-Hilaire. - Do you know it? - On the South Shore of Montreal. Yeah. You? No, I'm no tourist. Can I be familiar? Sure. You're shy. Maybe, I don't know. What do you do for work? I do maintenance at a bowling alley and a motel, too, but it closed. You lost your job? Yeah, well, the motel's closed. But I work at the bowling alley. Sorry, I'm not clear, am I? Do you like it? Yeah. You married? I'm divorced. What did you come here to do? Will you be staying long? Um, I don't know yet. Do you live at the motel or... No, the owner's a friend of mine. I drop by to see her often. Hey, I like your boots. Thank you. I have to buy a new coat. Really? The one you have on is nice. It's not warm enough. Sure, then... I hope you'll stay for a little while. Do you have any kids? Yeah, I have a daughter. She's 12. - You? - No. I'm going to have to ask you for some cash if you want me to stay. - Is it cold out? - Yeah. Here. Your little pussy was frozen solid. It's a pretty name, Julyvonne. God... Fucking hell! Rosie? It isn't Rosie, Julyvonne. It's me. Are you all right? Yeah, sure. I had another breakdown, but I should be home soon. I just wanted to see if you were OK. Do you feel better? Yeah, I feel better. Oh yeah. I'll be there soon, OK? If you like. I love you, Julyvonne. More than anything in the world. Don't be mad, OK? I'm sorry. I'm going to hang up, now, OK?
