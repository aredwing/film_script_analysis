Let's go. - Inhyung? - Yeah? - Did you tell your parents? - No. - Let me see that notebook. - Right now? - Yeah. - Why? - Because I'm bored. - But you've seen it already. - Give it to me! - Stop it! Nurse: "Inhyung Chung" So, you want us to make you look like this? I'm afraid that won't be possible. Why not? This drawing's not that different from yourself. Miss, I think you came to the wrong clinic. Our services may cost a little more than you can pay. How much exactly? ...to make me look like you. Inhyung? I noticed his hand was bandaged, do you know what happened to him? I heard his dog bit him. His hand got infected, so he missed work for couple days. That dog is so handsome. That crazy guy, why would anyone give a dog plastic surgery? Everyone's doing it these days. They are doing it with their own money. Besides it's better than giving them debarking surgery. I need a surgery too. What surgery? - Face. - What's wrong with your face? You're kidding, right? I have to do it before yearbook pictures. You're just a kid, there's no rush. You got yours done before yearbook. - This is not under discussion. - Why not? - Don't start again. - Can't I? Do it with your own money. Uh, I'm so exhausted. What's going on here? What's the deal? You didn't answer my call. So what do you think? Is it weird or not? Research Participants Needed for Plastic Surgery What is this exactly? Oh, that. That's just a formality. Everyone signs it... just sign right there. Miss? Can you hear me? Can you open your eyes? Damn, I'm in trouble.
