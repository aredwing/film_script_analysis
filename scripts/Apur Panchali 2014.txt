I met him was... when a foreigner came to take our photographs. We had gone to Boral. That's when I met him. The entire thing was organized by... Mr. Nemai Ghosh, Ray's still photographer. Filmmaker Bo Vanders had come from Brussels to make a documentary on me. They had "Pather Panchali's" Apu and Durga in their script. They were looking for Apu. I told them... of his ancestral home near 'Wireless Park (Kudghat Tollygunge). That is where he lives now. They did find him there. And... This is Subir. He played good football. I don't know why he didn't continue! Dada(brother) is leaving for Dhanbad tomorrow. He found a job. Father is not very well either. How can I possibly leave town to play a match? You... give up too soon. Once you're off, Sujoy and Alok will get into the team. What else can I do? When you go, I can stay over at your place. Moloy, you're making it look like a World Cup match! You're in form this season. Manna says the Mohanbagan Club will absorb you. Mohanbagan? Me??- I swear, he said so! Never. East Bengal Club. If I play at all. German Refugee Team? You are the typical Ghoti (orthodox townsman). We're refugees. So is our team. We score 3 for 0 in the league. That's an accident. An accident, is it? Heard of anyone getting allergies for eating Hilsa? No.- - Happens with prawns! Let's go. I've committed a blunder. Should've asked Pram od to give my proxy at attendance! He's not very friendly with... The opposite lane. Third house on the right. Second floor. But he's a very cranky fellow. Watch out! 'Cranky', or short-tempered? You'll know when you see him. Go on. Why don't you say so? Then I won't write my exam! That's not what I meant. You always misunderstand. I misunderstand? Always? You keep interrupting my study. And my exams are on Monday! You run out of turmeric, oil... Can't you ask me to get them all at once? I won't go out after this. - Fine, then I'll go. A young lad will sit at home like a king... and the old mother will work like a slave! Now you're getting it wrong. Did I say I won't go?
