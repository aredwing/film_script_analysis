From a distance, they seem so mysterious, so powerful, so perfect. You'd never guess they're really just big, bloated balls of hot, smelly gas. Unless, by some freaky twist of fate, you got close to one, like I did. Because the star I'm talking about is... an actor, an actor living in paradise. So rich, so pampered, so out of touch, he forgot what real life was like. - MAN: Waiting on talent! - WOMAN: Waiting on talent! - Or maybe, he never really knew. - MAN #2: Waiting on talent! Hey, Liz, what's up? Time is up, Trey. Is he coming out or not? It's not looking good. I mean, he's really depressed. Why? [sighs] Come in. But park the negativity outside, and I'll show you why. Hmm? A fleece? A black-and-white spotted fleece? I mean, one of your P.A.s was wearing this. So what? It reminds him of the girl that broke his heart is so what. And now he's in there, and he can't think of anything else. Trey, the director's furious. The weather's getting dicey, and the plane's been sitting on the runway idling for hours. It's his last skydiving shot, Trey. There must be something that I can do. Rexxx... Rexxx? All he sees is Lola. [Rexxx whimpering] [beads tinkling] [tango playing] [whimpering] [grunting] [grunting continues] [whimpering] [groaning] LIZ: This is crazy, Trey. He has to work. Then you tell him. Rexxx... we are talking about your legacy. - [whimpers] - That's right. Your legacy. Compared to you, that Taco Bell dog is just a footnote in history. [whiny groan] [growling] [barking] I had no idea that bugged him. Let's get his tuxedo and his props on. Yes. Let's shoot this thing, buddy. Secret Agent Dewey Branson is ready for action. - [barking] - Liz... you're a miracle worker. Thank you. - MAN [over radio]: "A" camera's set. - WOMAN: "B" camera's good to go. MAN 2: "C" and "D" cameras are ready. SHANE: But sometimes miracles... - MAN 3: Copy that. - ...can turn into nightmares. [indistinct radio chatter] ...seven, take one, we have feed. [thunder rumbles] Oh, my God! What happened?! It's not my fault! The lightning popped the chute before I could strap it on! [howling] [howling continues] [squishing] [groaning] [adhesive parting] [whimpering] [howling] [howling] Liz... Liz... i-i-it's his. We're close. We're close. MAN: You guys look over there by that hill. We have to keep looking. LIZ: Trey... Trey, his hairpiece could have landed miles away from... from the rest of him. There are lakes and rivers all over this place. I... I'm sorry. I was supposed to take care of him. I suck. I suck. - [sobbing]: I suck. - No. [sobbing]: I suck. I suck! You don't suck. [engine idling] [whines softly] SHANE: Maybe the lesson is: sometimes, to get to real paradise, you need to take a road so dark, there are no stars. MAN: Help! [coughing] Help me! I can't get out! Is anyone there? Help me! Shane...! [gasps] Shane, you're drooling. Dude, you are freaking out. What's up with you? I didn't get any sleep at all last night. I was playing Alien Siege for 11 straight hours. Oh, you're so lucky your old man pulls 24-hour shifts, dude. What level did you get up to? Uh, 13. I was blazing. J.J.: You're such a liar. There's no level higher than nine. Not for you, J.J. Obviously, you didn't see the black hole. Uh-huh. So, Shane, if you were gaming all night, I guess you're not worried about the science test. [school bell ringing] See you there. Arlo took it first period. He said it was brutal. Aw, man, I'm doomed. And I'm way doomed. Hey, guys, I'm just gonna hit the head real quick. [rock music playing] TEACHER: Keep your books closed. You may not refer to your notes. Do not look at anyone else's test. Please be sure to put your name in the top left-hand corner. And read through in its entirety. Go. [man singing rock] [siren whooping] [man singing rock fades] How's it going, Shane? Don't you guys have a fire to put out? Picking up filters for the rig. So, what, you ditching school today? Uh, hello? Holiday. Malcolm X's birthday. Malcolm X's birthday. Is that today? Yeah, Malcolm X Day. Right... on. SHANE: Hey, I'm gonna roll. I'll see you guys later. Hey, you want to hitch with us? No, I'm cool. I'm just gonna clear my head. Hey, don't be getting yourself into any trouble today! Thanks, Lionel, I already have a dad! You'd better call the cap. [phone rings] Joe! Get the phone! You get it! You get it! I'm making lunch! WOMAN: You're closer, okay?! MAN: Cap! Pep won't answer the phone! Since you guys are so busy... Engine 55. Connor... Uh, Captain Fahey speaking. LIONEL: Heads up, Cap. We just saw Shane on Fulton Avenue. When? Like, now, maybe 30 seconds ago. TERENCE: Hey, ask him if today's Malcolm X's birthday. Bring him in. LIONEL: Okay, Cap, we're on it. And, uh, and maybe pick up lunch. [objects landing in pot] [engine starts] I hate to bring him in today. [siren whooping] [distant alarm sounding] [dogs barking] Shut your yap. [groans] [growls] Oh, yeah. You're mine. [frustrated whimper] All try... all fail. [barking] [chuckling] Oh, yeah. That's right. End of the line, mutt. [chuckles] [grunts, huffs] [barking] [rock music blasting through earphones] [siren whooping] [Rexxx barks, Shane yells] [growls] [burps loudly] Ugh! Mouth fart. Ugh! If you're gonna ditch, you're gonna get caught, Shane. What do you got to say for yourself, huh? I hate that dog. [siren blaring in distance] [sniffing] [whimpering softly] [crowd cheering] You're my favorite star. I have a question- Rexxx, over here. Tell us, Rexxx, who are you wearing? [clamoring continues] MAN: Rexxx, a few words for your fans. [whimpering] [snoring] [muffled explosion] [fire crackling] [woman speaking indistinctly over intercom] WOMAN [over intercom]: Bay Street. Vehicle fire. Incident 205-0. Be advised. South Harbor 55 is off-line until further notice. Cap's waiting for you in the locker room. And he is seriously angry. Yeah, what else is new? I guess you'll find out when you get punished. Hey, dude, just do what I do. The second he opens his mouth, start crying. Or better yet, tell him it's in your DNA. That means everything horrible you do is his fault. Joe, how do I play this one? Play? You get in there, look him in the eye, and say you're sorry. Go! Give him a break, Joe. Kid's mom split when he was, like, two. He's an orphan. He's not an orphan. He's got a dad. PEP: Yeah, so no mom and a firefighter dad. Pretty much makes him an orphan. - Right. - Well, he's got us. Hope he finds a good shrink. [video game whirring, beeping] Hey. How many times did I warn you about ditching? Three? Four? That's, um, that's my PSP, Dad. Can I have it back? You know, it doesn't seem to matter what I say. So I'm gonna hit you where it hurts. - No PSP, - What?! no PlayStation, Come on, Dad, don't do this to me. ...no iPod. Dad, come on. You know, nothing else seems to work with you. [alarm wailing] DISPATCHER [over P.A.]: Engine 55, Engine 24... I don't know what to do, Shane. - Ladder 33, respond. - Come on. Hamilton Avenue, structure fire. Terence! You took my helmet again. This is definitely mine. Then why's my name on it? [engine sputtering] Exactly. Hey, come on, guys. Suit up is supposed to take one minute, - no more. - DRIVER: Let's go, Dogpatch! [over radio]: South Side's getting hot, Captain. WOMAN: Copy that. Check the extremities, then set up for a ground deluge. Roger that. What's the status inside, Burke? Secondary search complete, Captain. It's all clear inside. All right, lose the masks and position all crews for exterior attack. No rescues for you today, Sparky. Entry Control, secondary search is complete. Let's lock up that building- no one else goes in. [firefighters shouting in distance] [metallic creaking] [whimpers] [siren wailing] [horn honking] [firefighters shouting in distance] Dad. Stay in the rig, Shane. PEP: Looks like Greenpoint's first on the scene. - Again? - And we're last. Again. Hey, Jess. Last four in a row, Dogpatch. Looks like you're buying the ice cream. - Yeah, where do you want us? - Stand by. We'll see where we need you. And don't trip over my hoses. Yes, sir. All right, boys, surround and drown. We're standing by. [groans] Great. - Standing by again. - Beautiful. [barking] Dad, look! [barking] McBride, double-time me to the roof. [ladder whirring] [firefighters shouting in distance] [barking] Come on, guys, step it up! Let's do this. Ready and... lift! [grunts] [Rexxx barking, structure creaking] [glass shattering] [whines, barks] Hang on, boy. [barking] Just hang on. [crackling, creaking] [whimpers] [grunts] No! [Shane gasps] [panting] Hang on, bud. Hang on. Okay, let's move. Firefighter down. JOE: Dogpatch, where's that life net? - Let's move it! - Let's go! Need another man. - Let's move. Let's move this. - I'm on it! Hustle! Hang on, we're coming, Cap! Guys... - snap it up! - Hustle, guys, come on, move it. Focus, guys, we're almost there. That's it. That's it. [whimpers] Hang on, Cap. Move! To the right! No! [gasps] - [all gasping] - Huh? [firefighters murmuring] [moans inquisitively] Come on, mutt. Let's get him some oxygen. Dad, you okay? Yeah. Come on. - Cap, you all right? - I'm okay. I'm fine. How's the dog? Smells like rotten tomatoes, but he'll live. SHANE: Oh, no. Not you. CONNOR: You know this dog? Yeah, it's the mutt from hell. PEP: "Dew." He's got a name but no address, no phone number. I'll call Animal Control. No, we'll handle it. So much for standing by, huh, Connor? All right, 55, we got hot spots on the South Side. Let's hustle. [softly]: Yes! Back in the game. All right, put the dog in the rig, all right? Me? Yeah, you. All right, Joe. Come on, you got it. [warning alarm beeping] Hey, Zach. Hey, Cap, we got company. Hey, Zach. Hey, Connor. - Welcome back. - Oh, thanks. - Hey. - Hey. - It's good to see you, man. - Yeah, you, too. I guess I haven't seen you since, uh... SHANE: Uncle Marc's memorial. Yeah, it's... too long. I've been meaning to come around, but... You gonna stay for dinner? Who's cooking this week? Me. - I made plenty. - How's it going, Joe? I, uh... I better not. I'm a little pressed for time. Can we talk? Yeah. Hey, Pep. You want to get back into that engine? We just... We cannot be late on another call. I'm on it. Hey, guys, clean up that gear, get the truck ready. Shane, you're still on dog duty. [sighs] [snorting, laughing] Dog duty. What? He said it. Dog duty? [snorting, laughing] Shane, grab my tools, okay? Yeah. Come on, mutt. [growls] Fine, suit yourself. [fire truck horn blowing] [siren wailing] [distorted]: Hey! Shane! Yo, Shane! Today, little bro. Yeah, I'm coming. LIONEL: Hey, Terence, let's get these hoses cleaned up. ZACH: How's Shane doing? Oh, wish I knew. Doesn't talk to me anymore, you know, unless it's some half-baked lie or lame excuse. Just, since Marc died, it's just... I think he's just having trouble moving on. And what about you? I'm fine. These the suspect fires you were talking about? Yeah... Yeah, thanks for sending out those incident reports; I know it wasn't exactly protocol. [chuckles] No, it wasn't. They add up to anything? No, well, not yet, but I think... I think there might be a fire bug. Connor... the department has experts who handle this kind of thing. And last I looked, the captain's office is over there. Yeah, well, I like sitting out here. It keeps me close to the guys. Okay, so, Joe's cooking didn't bring you down here-what's up? After the mill fire, everybody from the mayor on down was counting on you to fill Marc's shoes. Now, we all expected a period of adjustment. Your brother was one hell of a fire captain. Those were big shoes to fill, and we knew that. But these last couple of months... Downtown is worried that this house isn't moving in the right direction. [sighs] [soft growl] What are you looking at? Not a word out of you, mutt. [disgruntled growl] Who's that guy? City manager. But he's okay. He was one of us. Which is exactly why they sent him to spank us. Every time I make a supply request, it comes back with a big red X on it. Budget cuts are hitting everybody hard. Look, I'm sorry, Connor, but the city council is advising the mayor to shut down Dogpatch. If it happens, your territory will be absorbed by Shoreline Station and Greenpoint. [humming "The Marine Corps Hymn"] Grub's on! Meat stew. Wash up! Let's go! [sniffing] [whimpers] You hear me?! Get a move on! It's meat stew! [burps, coughs] I hate it when he says "meat stew" like that. Why doesn't he just tell us what's in it? It's meat. Mm-hmm. More like mystery meat. Yeah, but it's starting to taste more and more like... [plopping] Dog, you just read my mind. Hey, what are you doing?! If you don't... Dog, if you don't get off that table, I'm gonna... [Joe shouting, Rexxx barking] [overlapping yelling] Whoa. Is that thing rabid? No. Easy, Zach. He hasn't bitten anybody. - [barking] - LIONEL: Come on, Terence, grab him! - Yet. - I got him! No, not his tail! Geez! JOE: Terence, you nitwit! - [dishes crashing] - You stay. - There he goes! - Come on, cut him off! - Lock him in the engine room. - Cut him off! [door slams] Can't you just buy us some time? I mean, come on, Zach. You owe us that. I'll see what I can do. I told you... I told you to watch him. I did. I-I was. You... - ...going to. - Right. Okay, take him home. Make up a "found dog" flyer, and I want it posted first thing in the morning. You got that? Yeah. [sighs] [whimpers] Nice, huh? Enjoy it while it lasts. [whimpers] [whines] What's the matter with you? [barking] Hey! Where are you going?! Stop! Are you crazy?! Get back here. [whining] [sneezes] [whimpering] [barking] What? What is your problem? [whines] [whines] What? [whines] You are one strange dog. Come on, mutt, look at me. Stop moving. Hold still. Hey. No. No... no... Loser. What are you doing? No, no, everything has a place. This is my house! This is my room. - Stop. - [fabric tearing] You're ripping it. [ripping, tearing] Let go! [grunts] [barks] This is my house. And this is my bed. - [thud] - [barking] Night, mutt. [low growling] [grunting]: You're probably not even lost. They probably kicked your crusty butt to the curb! Fine. Sleep well, fur ball, 'cause tomorrow you're out of here. [grunts] [sighs] [Rexxx snoring] [snoring continues] JOE: Come on, rookie. My grandmother can lay hose straighter than that. Yeah, she can also bench press 350 pounds. Hey, Shane! PEP: What's up, Shane? Shanester! How's it? Keep it straight! Keep it straight! Okay, Captain, try it now. [clicking] Nothing. This thing's a rat's nest. Flyers are done. Need the stapler. Yeah, okay, well, take it easy. We're running short on just about everything. Sit. Sit. He's not very friendly for a dog, is he? You don't know the half of it. [on TV]: This is Felicity Hammer bringing you tragic news. After a massive manhunt, the search for missing superstar Rexxx... has been called off. - Tragically, the number one - [curious whimper] box office champ of such films as Jurassic Bark and its sequels had just launched his own pet perfume line. The perfume, redolent of bacon, squirrel and butt crack, had taken the luxury pet industry by storm. Rexxx's lifetime companion, manager Trey Falcon, was unavailable for comment, but inside sources - report he has scheduled - [barking] a private memorial service for later this month. [barking] Next up, Cher turns 60? [chuckles] Stay tuned. [whimpers] [in distance]: How 'bout now?! Uh... no. [howls forlornly] Are all these red pins arson fires? No, not officially. According to the city. But... that's the textile mill. Yeah. You think the fire that killed Uncle Marc was set on purpose? I don't know, um... I mean, you see the same flashover and burn patterns again and again... Uh... I don't know. Maybe I could help. You know, Shane, Shane... don't worry about it; it's just a theory. Now, if you really want to help, you could find Dewey's owner, okay? Yeah. Okay. [barking] [indistinct chatter] No, stop! [barking] [grunts] If you don't stay in one place, I can't get rid of you. [barking continues] [grunts] [stapler clacking] Fine. Sit... stay, whatever it takes to leave me alone. [stapler clacking] Look out! [curious whimper] [yelps and yaps] [barks] [gasps] What are you, some kind of freak-show circus dog? [snarly barking] So... what else you got? [siren wailing in distance] [suspenseful theme playing] [ticking] Ow! [watches ticking] [pop music playing] [laughing] [man singing rock] Mikey, Max, if you don't leave your daddy alone, I'm gonna... [growls] [boys screaming] [chuckling] Works every time. I heard that, Joe. MOTHER: Max, stop biting your little brother. Thanks. - [applause] - All right, everybody, let's give it up for Falstaff from Shoreline Company C, who's leaving his mark on this course. And while our volunteers clean that up, I want to bring up the man whose company has underwritten this entire day for us. Please give it up for Mr. Corbin Sellars. [cheering] Thank you, Zach. Don't applaud me. I should be applauding you. SELLARS [in distance]: Honestly... Went down pretty hard in that ladder climb competition. Good thing you landed on your head. [chuckling]: Yeah. [all laughing] Yeah. [mocking laughter] SELLARS: You know, when I was a pro ball player, my coach had a quote that he used before every game. "It's not what lies before us..." You know, I bet your brother's looking down today and smiling. - "It's what lies within us." - Yep. Yeah, nothing made Marc happier than kicking Greenpoint's butt. ...all of you today... [cheering] But you didn't come here to listen to some old quarterback yammer. So, next up... we have Sparky of Greenpoint, as he's handled by Jasmine "J.J." Presley, daughter of illustrious Fire Captain Jessie Presley. [cheering] - Here we go. - Come on, J.J. [onlookers shouting] Stay. [horn blares] [man singing rock] Somebody should test that dog for steroids. [man singing rock fades] - [cheering] - [buzzer sounds] And Sparky completes the course in a record time of 44 seconds, eclipsing the record set last year by Blue of Dogpatch Station. Let's give him a hand, ladies and gentlemen. Aw, man! Nice job, J.J. That was awesome! [cheering continues] Let's get out of here, Captain. Our, uh, our final competitor is Dogpatch's own Dewey, handled by Shane Fahey, son of Captain Connor Fahey. Shane? And the "mutt from hell"? [blues rock intro playing] [man singing blues rock] What? Come on. What is that? That all you got? [man singing blues rock ends] [onlookers laughing] - Oh, come on! - Nice mutt! - Yeah! - Dogpatch, you gotta be kidding me. - Whoo! - His legs are too short. [laughs] GIRL: No chance! [horn blares] Go on, Dewey. [cheering in distance] Hey, don't trip, Fahey. - Let's go, Dewey! - Let's go, Dewey! - Come on, Dewey! - WOMAN: You call that a dog? MAN: That dog's a mutt! All right, all right! Go, Dewey, yeah! [man singing rock] Dewey is beating Sparky's split time by a full three seconds. Oh, yeah, now what?! Huh? Now what? [whooping] [clacking] All right! [whines] Hold on, hold on. Dewey's stopped right before - the final obstacle. - Dewey, what's wrong? Dewey, jump! Go! [whining] [man singing rock fades] [echoing]: Dewey? Dewey? [whooshing] [tango playing] [men speaking French in distance] [sniffs] [whines] [whimpers, grunts] [whining] [low growl] Get over it, dude. She's not the only babe on the beach. [whines] SHANE: Dewey! [buzzer sounds] Game over, folks. - Sparky and J.J. Presley win the dog challenge. - No! Man! [cheering, whooping] WOMAN: Yes! Yes! MAN: How did that happen? Oh, I'm so proud of you. Thanks. BURR: Hey, yo, Dog Pound. Hey, Connor. Got some news about your firehouse dog. He's afraid of fire. Last place- the mutt's perfect for you guys. Way to go, losers. That was so... awesome. Just the look on their faces when they thought they were gonna lose! LIONEL: Yeah, watching them sweat, it's the best thing I've seen in months. [chuckling] Come on, let's get out of here. Go on, rub it in. I just wanted to say that... the better dog lost. Come on. SPORTSCASTER: At the 40, the 30, he may go all the way! He's at the 20, the 10... Hey, where you been? - Touchdown! - [cheering] Just out walking, shaking off the loss. Hey, sit down with your old man. Watch some football, like the old days. Yeah. [Shane sighs] [sighs] [whistle blows] - [chuckles] - What? I was just thinking, I... It's been a long time since I've seen my guys that happy. He could've won, Dad. Yeah, he should've won. SPORTSCASTER: ...all the way to the end zone. Incredible play for the Bulldogs. [sniffing, whining] [whines] So, I saw you talking to Jessie's little girl at the picnic. What's the deal with you and her? Dad, she's Greenpoint. Just... I'm just asking. Forget I mentioned it. [chuckles] You have any luck on the flyers you put up? No, not yet. Okay, well, give it time. Somebody's gonna call. [whining] [yelping] - Dad... - Mm-hmm? I-I was thinking... what if nobody calls? Maybe he could stick around for awhile. M-Maybe Dogpatch needs another mascot. No, Dogpatch is living on borrowed time. There's not much point in a mascot now. Well, I-I could take care of him and you wouldn't have to deal with him at all. You really want to be responsible for this dog? Yeah, I do. - [yelps] - [crashing, clattering] [glass breaking] [sighs] Okay, you wanted to be responsible for the dog, you got it. - But... - Shane. [liquid dripping] [sighs] Let's get a mop. [sighs] What the...?! Dog, if you messed up my room... Great. I'm sharing my cell with Martha Stewart. Sorry, fleabag, not tonight. You need to learn some healthy boundaries. [sighs] [sighs] And you better not snore. [Dewey farts] You're such a jerk. [farting] [groans] [panting] [device beeping] Hey! That TV is my personal property. And no, I don't have a receipt. Who's that? Bean counter. Sent by the city. Pretty soon, everything in here'll be shipped off to stations all over the city, including us. But they can't split you guys up. Yeah, they can! And they will. Not much of the old neighborhood left anyway. Everything's been all boarded up and sold off. Guess there's some things even a fireman can't save. Remember what I told you, now- no lunch till you get that engine room mopped up. Good to know. [chuckling] Hey... nobody's supposed to be in here. Couple of weeks, nobody will be. [alarm beeping] DISPATCHER: Engine 55, Engine Eight, Engine 33... Come on, Terence, we got to roll. DISPATCHER: Ladder 24, Ladder 36, Rescue Seven respond. [groans] How many times have I told you- wait till my feet hit the floor first! Come on, you lovebirds, get the lead out! Let me go first next time. What do you think this is, clown school?! They wouldn't let you in the police department. - LIONEL: Me first, then you. - Guys... check out the dog. Shane, get over here. CONNOR: Get the dog off the rig. He's not a mascot. Don't let him out of your sight. Dewey, down! [huffs] [whining] [engine revving] [siren blares] [horn honks] [whining] What's the matter with you? Crap. Coming in right now. WOMAN: That's right, get 'em behind the barricade! [siren blaring] MAN: We need these people back. WOMAN: Okay. [siren chirping] MAN: Need a medic. Okay, take it easy. You're gonna be fine. MAN: Get those people off the bridge! We have folks down there trying to do a job. WOMAN: I need to get through. Okay, everybody here behind the barricade. Hey, guy... I need you to step away from the rail, please. Everybody follow me- Look at me, please, sir. Back behind the barricade. Here you go, buddy. [groaning] CONNOR: Hey, Burr? What's the size-up? Retrofitters breached the interior support, so the ceiling's coming down pretty fast. Got the workers out just in time. Where does Jessie want us? My money's on broom detail. MAN: All clear. Let's lock it up. [indistinct shouting] Easy, buddy, nice and easy. MAN: Nobody else goes in. Burr, where's Captain Presley? Just look for the red helmet. No, Burr... Where's Jessie? Engine 24 captain unaccounted for. initiating a primary search. Dewey? Dewey? [indistinct voices] Dewey, get over here. [sniffing] [Dewey whining] Dewey? Dewey, get over here. [groans] [whining] Dewey! [whining continues] What's the matter with you? [barking] [barking] [grunts] [barking continues] Burr, how many points of access? Just the one. Cave-in blocked the south ent... - [explosive boom] - [firefighters gasp] Get-Get back. Everybody back! [panicked shouting] Look out! This whole place is coming down. Captain, what do we do? If Jessie's still in there, we're gonna get her. - Okay, let's do it. - Pull everybody back. - We're not leaving her... - You're staying put. Yeah. That's an order, Burr. Joe, keep the medic close and ready- I'll be on channel one. We're coming with you, Captain. No. Thanks, but no. Uh, Dispatch, I need a dedicated channel for search and rescue. DISPATCHER: Roger that, 24, you're clear on channel three. Jessie, do you copy? [static crackles] Jessie, do you copy? [door creaks, bangs] [urgent barking] [officer speaking indistinctly] [steam hissing] [electrical buzzing, crackling] [muffled]:Jessie! [support beams creaking] Jessie! [thud echoing from distance] [debris clattering] [support beams creaking] [gasps] Jess. Jess. - [loud thud] - [gasps] [groans] [grunting, panting] [grunting, panting] [man shouting indistinctly in distance] [slow, somber theme playing] [Dewey grunting, barking anxiously] Joe, where's my dad? Shane! Stay back. He'll be fine. [Dewey barking excitedly] [barking continues] [sniffing, whining] Be careful. [barks] [intense, dramatic theme plays] [sighs] [grunting] Come on! [sniffing] [grunting] [barks] Get out of here, dog! I said get out of... [barks] [barking] [grunting anxiously] Jessie. Jess. [grunts] [breather mask hissing] [Jessie groans weakly] [loud thuds in distance] [building creaking] [creaking continues] [loud boom] [gasping] Captain? Do you copy? [radio static hissing] Guys, look! [excited shouts] [noble theme playing] [gasps] Medics! [sigh] Easy. [siren wails in distance] - Good job, Cap. - [laughing] MAN: I am ready to go home. Hey. Hey. We were worried about you in there. JESSIE [chuckles]: Another day at the office. [slow, gentle theme plays] CONNOR: All right, Jess, you take care of yourself. - We'll all be checking in. - Thanks. - I'll see you soon. - Okay. You betcha. [sirens whooping] REPORTER: Excuse me, is that that dog who saved the day? Yeah, it is. Who does he belong to? Engine 55. We're lucky to have him. His name is Dewey, and he's the mascot of Dogpatch Station. REPORTER: Huh! Well, smile, wonder dog. You made the news. [groans] [TV news theme plays] And we're back, at 12 minutes past the hour. This next one really made my day. An historic firehouse in Lincoln County, which has been slated for closure later this week is being credited with one last lifesaving rescue. REPORTER: Meet Dewey, mascot of Engine 55 and the hero of yesterday's tunnel collapse. Dewey is new to the team, but as you can see, he's raring to go. We spoke with Captain Connor Fahey and the brave firefighters of Engine 55 and asked them... [choir singing "Ave Maria"] NEWSWOMAN: The entertainment industry honors its own today at a memorial service for canine action star Rexxx, who died tragically last month. Security is tight, and emotions are high, as a veritable who's who of Hollywood stardom is in attendance. - [dogs whining] - TREY: I had a mantra: Next year, Rexxx. Next year we'll nap by a roaring fire. [voice breaking]: Next year we'll play Frisbee under a blue moon. Next year we'll take that hike through Joshua Tree. [whines] Well, there is no next year. And tonight, there's a bright new star shining in Heaven. [mourners sob quietly] TREY [crying]: I loved my dog. [quacking] [whining] It's just the way he would have wanted it, thanks to you. [sniffles] - [music stops] - Cut the water! Ah, it's the least I could do. Rexxx always had a flair for drama. [crying quietly] Oh, Trey. Let me take you to dinner, okay? [crying]: I can't... I can't believe he's gone. Now it's too late for Rexxx to just be a dog. [Dewey snoring] [man singing rock] [Dewey groans] [farting] [Dewey groans] [alarm blaring] DISPATCHER: Engine 55, Ladder 24, Ladder Eight, Rescue Nine, respond. Kessler Parkway, electrical fire. Power lines down. Come on, guys! [sirens wailing] [man singing rock continues] [whining] [both laugh] [crash] No. [crash] Fine. [alarm blaring] Okay. Move over. [video game race car roaring] [man singing rock fades] [shifts gears] Figures. We finally get our act together just in time to close. PEP: Yep. Good old Dogpatch- late as usual. That's us. JOE: Well, at least we came out swinging, right? Someone order rocky road? CONNOR [chuckles]: Is that a parting gift, Zach? No, courtesy of Greenpoint. Told 'em I was coming over here on business anyway. I, uh... prefer to give bad news in person. You got our reassignments? Afraid not. Okay, so what's the bad news? [sighs]: Bad news is... you're gonna be up all night unpacking this stuff. The orders came down from the mayor himself: Dogpatch is staying put. For real? That furry little publicity magnet you've got there saved this company's rear end. - [loud laughter] - Yeah! - Dewey! - Yeah! - That's so solid, man! - What?! - [grunts inquisitively] - Okay! Yeah! [barking] - Whoa! - Whoa! [laughter] CONNOR: Well, Shane was right. Maybe all Dogpatch needed was a good dog. [Shane laughing] [whistle blows] BOY: Okay, shoot, shoot! What's up? What do you think is up? Mrs. Renzi busted a pop quiz first period. - Arlo said it was... - Yeah. Brutal. I got it. No. Not just brutal. Way brutal. [bell rings] Oh, man. - Can I copy off of you? - I was gonna copy off of you. Hey, you copied off me last time. - That was one answer! - It was an answer. You owe me. See you later, Shane. GIRL: Where's my lunch money? As your friends in first period undoubtedly told you, there will be a pop quiz today. This quiz will cover everything we reviewed last week. And remember, any incomplete answers do count as mistakes. I see a lot of gum chewing. Please visit the wastebasket immediately if that is the case. Thank you. Hey, Joe, check this out. B-plus on my science test. [chuckles] Hey! I'm impressed. Did you copy? No. I studied for almost one whole night. Are you... actually cooking? - Hey. - Hey, Shane. - Where's my dad? - He's downtown at a meeting, knockin' heads. Where's his stuff? In his office. [quiet, melancholy theme plays] Sure... make yourself right at home. What was wrong with his old office? He's captain- he belongs here. Look, I know I told you to blame your DNA for all your problems. Moving on wasn't easy for your dad, but he's finally stepping up... and maybe you should, too. [typing rapidly] [Dewey snoring] [continues snoring] [knock at door] Hey... hey, I just got a call from the Public Affairs Office. Apparently, the mayor wants you and Dewey to appear at the Firefighters Benefit. That's cool, huh? Yeah. What's going on? I-I was... I was just getting you organized. [computer beeping softly] Wait a minute. This is... this is my... Yeah, your wall map. It beats pushpins. You... you shouldn't have done all this. Sorry. No, I mean, you should never have felt that this was your responsibility. [sighs heavily] I know in the past six months I've really been ragging on you for just about everything, and I... I think the truth is, I'm the one who's... been neglecting what's important. What's that? It's you. 'Cause you're so smart... and capable and strong. And I've been... kind of lost in all of this since Marc died, and I... I think I've turned into a pretty lousy dad. I'm sorry. And thanks for this. I'm not strong. I'm weak. I'm a bad person. Why would you even... think something like that? The day of the mill fire... I was at school. The trucks drove by. [siren wailing] Hey! [laughing]: There he is. Shane! [siren echoing] Then J.J. called her mom. She said a firefighter was missing. I ran back to the fire station as fast as I could. When I got there, nobody would look at me. [crying]: Not Joe... not Lionel... not Pep. That's when I was sure you were dead. I loved Uncle Marc. But when I found out it was him... I was happy. I was happy 'cause it wasn't you. [sniffles] [sniffles] [crying] We're gonna be okay. [sighs] [Dewey snoring] [both laughing] [sniffling] Thank you. Okay, we've just got the tally. Now, this "little reception" has raised over $100,000 for our firefighters. How 'bout that, huh? Yes, give yourself a round of applause and while you're at it, how about something for our honored guests from Dogpatch Station, Engine 55? [jazz playing] Now maybe we can squeeze a new battery out of the department. Thanks for pleading our cause with the mayor. Hey, don't thank me; thank Super Mutt. Hey, where's Pep? She's gonna miss all this. I don't know. I'll try her again. Here she comes, and she is way out of uniform. Since when are you a girl? Stop staring. You'll burn holes. [laughter and applause] Okay, seriously, let's get to the real reason we're here tonight. This little pooch has been on CNN, Fox News and all five local news channels. We're on! Please welcome the pride of Engine 55, Dewey the Wonder Dog and his boy, Shane Fahey. [cheering, whooping] [jazz playing] Go, Shane! Now, Shane is 12 years old. Dewey is an undetermined age, just like me. [laughter] Anyhow, have fun. SHANE: Thanks, Mr. Sellars. Hey, everybody. So, before I get to the more radical stunts, let's start with something simple. I need a volunteer, first of all. How about you, Mr. Sellars? Do you have a, uh, a watch or a wallet or something you carry on you? [chuckling] I'm gonna get this back, right? We hope. [audience laughing] All right. [sniffing] See, all right? All right, no peeking. [whines] [audience moans sympathetically] So, the next step is to hide the watch. Dad. [audience murmuring] Hide it good, now, Captain. SHANE: Being a firehouse mascot isn't all just for show. It's a real job that requires real skills. Search and rescue requires something more. All right, Dewey... find it. Go ahead. Dewey's sense of smell is 10,000 times more powerful than a human's. That, combined with the ability for him to think on his paws, makes him an invaluable search and rescue dog. He can remember a scent for weeks, even months, and recognize it from a great distance. [sniffing] [whines] It really is you. [barking] Oh, I missed you, too. I missed you so much. I don't know how, and I don't care, but you found my dog. [murmuring] TREY: I was so bumming, and then I saw his picture in the paper, and dudes, I couldn't believe it. This dog is not an actor. Oh, yeah, you must have seen him in The Fast and the Furriest. Dudes, come on, that's a Rexxx classic. His name's not even Rexxx; it's Dewey. It says so on his tag. No, see, that was the prop tag he was wearing when he got lost. Our dog is not a movie star, he's not a celebrity. He's a... he's a mutt. I mean, we-we practically found him on the street. Yeah, well, see... he looks different in these production stills because his trademark hairdo is, uh... it's a hairpiece. That's my boy. I mean, come on, you must've noticed how special he was. Uh, look, Mr. Falcon, I mean, I can appreciate what you must have gone through, but this, uh... this dog means a lot to our engine company, a lot to the city... and particularly to my son. Now, if there's any way that we can compensate you, uh... If you're asking me to put a price on family... I can't. It's time for Rexxx to come home. You can't take him away. [sighs] Well, Shane... Dad, do something. Shane... it's his dog. I know this doesn't mean much to you right now, but... thanks for taking care of him. Well, you got it wrong. He was the one taking care of us. [whines] Get out of here, then. Just go. [whines] Take him. I'm sorry. He was a pain in the butt, anyway. [whines] Well, I was going to say something wise and fatherly, but the truth is, this just sucks. Cap, we got an EMS call. [sighs] - [horns honking] - JOE: Fire Department! MAN: Hey! - Come on, let's go. - Wait! PEP: Hold up. CONNOR: All right, let's find you a ride home. Brought my skateboard. - Shane, I'll find you a ride home. - Just leave me alone. Well, I'll see you at home. [sighs] [indistinct conversation] WOMAN: Steve, let's clear off these centerpieces... [dinnerware clattering] [ticking] [whooshing] [ticking continues] [ticking continues] Thanks. And, hey, I'm sorry about your dog. Can I buy you another one? Another dog? Just think about it, okay? [man speaking indistinctly] SELLARS: Do you have a problem? I realize that, but there's nothing I can do. What is the holdup? More activity in that area right now is sure to draw attention. And I'm not just talking about Connor Fahey. I have finally put a city council in place that will approve a sports complex. I want that final property in ashes. Do it tonight. Tonight?! How am I gonna do that? [chuckles] You're a fireman. Figure it out. Light a match! [door opens] [mutters]: Son of a... God! - SELLARS: No! - [Shane gasps] Don't you tell me I'm impatient. I have waited long enough. No more excuses. Call me when it's done. [gasps] Dad was right. Ah, welcome to the Neu Hotel. Please, come, come, come. And if you need anything, please do not hesitate to... ask. Trash. [Rexxx barking] TREY: Hey, Rexxx, it's good to have you back, buddy. Dude, what were they feeding you, kibble? [Liz giggling] This is so unreal, Trey. Oh, I'm telling you... Deep down in my gut, I knew it was gonna take more than some nosedive to stop Rexxx. - Right, buddy? - [growls] Eat up; you need your energy. So, what are you guys gonna do first? - Mmm... - Huh? Tell me. First, a press conference. Yeah, I got the campaign all figured out. How about this? Rexxx- the Resurrection. What? Okay, a little esoteric. Yeah. What about...? What about all those things you said at the memorial? Huh? The playing Frisbee, hiking, treating him like a real dog? Mm...! Remember? Listen, I know Rexxx, okay? He doesn't want to be a real dog. He wants to be a star. He's dying to jump back into action, right, boy? [barks] Uh-huh... and speaking of that, I got a little surprise for you. [poodle yips] Some old friends, you know. [giggles] [siren blares in distance] [horn honking] [panting, growling] [siren wailing] [panting] [horn honks] [barking] [barks and whimpers] Chill, dude. It's just a couple of sirens. Get your head in the game, man. [horn honks] I mean, come on, buddy, the betties are waiting. [whines] [barking] Rexxx! [onlookers gasping] - What was that? - Where'd he come from?! [horn honks] [siren blares] Hey, guys, look! [tires screech] You're not gonna believe this, Cap. [chuckles] - Hey, come on, boy. - That's my Dewey! Go, go, go! You can jump! Go! [cheering] Hey, look who's back! - All right! - Yeah! [firefighters whooping, howling] Actually, Joe, I do believe it. [laughing] [keys jangling] MAN [on TV]: I will not hesitate to kill you. Hello? Dad? Anybody? [dramatic music plays on TV] [phone line ringing] Come on. Come on, pick up. [recorded]: This is Connor Fahey. You're reached my cellphone. Leave a message and I'll get back to you. [voice mail beeping] "Engine 55." "Harbor Fire"? That's everything, Cap. DISPATCHER: ...Pier 29, barge fire... CONNOR: Come on, Joe, you got to give me a little more. I don't know what this junk is, but it's getting hot fast. I hear you, Cap, but no can do. I'm maxing you out on the one that I have. Roger that. Maintaining deluge. [panicked shouting] - All right? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Everybody all right? - Yeah, we're good, Cap. Yeah. [dog barking] [indistinct voices] Guys? Clear up, watch those pumps. We're on it. Good eye, Dewey. [barks] Looks like I owe you an apology. For what? Your mascot. He isn't afraid of fire. He isn't afraid of anything. - NEWSCASTER: At this moment, - [phone rings] there are no indications that anything toxic... - Hello? - SHANE: J.J., my dad was right- I have to tell him. Wait, wait, Shane, slow down. What's going on? No, no, listen. I-Is your mom there? I can't get ahold of my dad. She's at the harbor. There's a monster blaze down there. I know, I think it's arson. I think they set it on purpose. What do you mean? Who? Corbin Sellars... and some other guy. I heard 'em talking about burning down buildings to make way for a stadium. They want to buy up all the land. But wait a second. Why would they set fire to the garbage barge? It's not even land. Okay, that's true. [sighs] Hang on. [beeping] Joe told me the whole neighborhood's been boarded up or sold off, except for... Except for what? Parts that have been burned down. [beeping] And the firehouse. Shane, what are you getting at? J.J., the barge is a decoy. The real target is here. I-It's Dogpatch. [whispering]: I think there's someone upstairs. Shane, you got to leave now. Shane? Shane?! Crap. [gasps] [hands squeaking along pole] Phew. Ow... Mm... [whooshing] Shane... what are you doing here? You set the fire that killed my uncle. He died in the line of duty. No, you did it. Hey, come on. Put that down. [electrical crackling] My dad trusted you, and you lied. Why'd you do it? To build a football stadium for Corbin Sellars? Shane, you're having trouble separating fact from fiction. Put that down and we'll talk about this outside. I'll put it down as soon as the cops get here, which will be any second now. You're lying. No! - [rumbling] - [gasps] Okay, guys, keep it on those hot spots. [barking] What's wrong, boy? Connor, it's my daughter. You should hear this for yourself. Hi, J.J., go ahead. [groaning] Shane! Shane! Can you hear me?! [grunts] Shane! Shane! [coughing] - [barking] - Whoa! [snarling] [snarling] [barks] All-all right, all right. You're... Nice doggy. You're a nice doggy. All right, stay back, now. [barking] Go, go. - Nice mutt. I... - [barking] [snarling] Sit. Stay! [barking] [snarling] [whimpering] [screams] [panting] [barking] [growling] [whimpering] [moaning] [barking] [flames crackling] [barks] [grunting] Come on... [coughing] [whimpering] [thud, whimper] [flames crackling in distance] Dewey? [coughing] Let's get out of here. [siren blaring] [horn blowing] [sighs] Whoa, whoa! Watch out, Cap! Good job, rook. Come on. [coughing] Come on, Dewey. [coughing] [barking] Come on! [grunting] [barking] All the doors are locked! There's no way in! - Guys, the roof's gonna go! - Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! [distant, faint barking] He's with Shane. He's found Shane! Pep! Shane! [door creaking] JOE: It's no good! It's not working! [grunting] Stand back! Engine 55 to Dispatch. We have a fire in our engine house. Persons believed inside. [grunting] [metal creaking] [barking] Hold up! Hold up! I'm coming out! [coughing] Zach! Where's Shane? [sirens blaring, horns blowing] I don't know. The place was in flames when I got here. I thought I heard someone inside, but I couldn't find him. I tried. I really tried. [coughs] Get him some oxygen. Don't let him leave. Let's hit that fire. [barking] CONNOR: Shane! Dad! I'm in here! [coughing, grunting] Dad! Are you all right? Dad, it's hard to breathe! Get back and stay low. [grunting] Come on! [grunting] Wait. Dad! Dad, give me your ax; I need to bust the hinges! If I break the glass, the fire's gonna flash over. Trust me. Stand back. [coughing] Okay. [air rushing] The top one first. The top one first. [grunting] It won't break! Lay on it, Shane! [Shane grunting, clanking] CONNOR: Come on! You can do it! [barking] Come on! Got it! [grunts] Dad. Come on, Dewey, get us out of here. [Connor coughing] [coughing] - [barking] - Hey, look! [coughing] Joe, we got him! We got to get him some air. Here, just jump up. [gasping] Easy. [coughing] Take it easy. It's all right. It's all right. [muffled grunts] Where's Zach Hayden? Just relax. [muffled grunts] He set the fires, Dad. He set all of them. Even the mill fire. You were right. [coughing] [coughing] Cap! Is it true? Is it true? Connor, no one was supposed to get hurt. - Cap! - What about my brother?! - What about my son?! - No! ZACH: It was Corbin Sellars! He promised! Sorry. My bad. Just give him to the cops. Come on. Come on, get up. - We got one for you, Mac. - Got it. MAC: We'll take it from here. Hey. You really kept your cool in there. Yeah. Must be my DNA. Thanks. Thanks. [applause] Okay? [laughing] [laughing] [applause] [barks] Will Rexxx make his Broadway debut in The Canine Mutiny? - [cameras clicking] - Rexxx denies that. Come on, Trey, throw us a bone here. Is it true there's a tape of Rexxx with Paris Hilton's Chihuahua? TREY: All I can say is - Rexxx is prepping for - Hey, Shane. the most important role of his life. Cool medal. Uh, it's okay, I guess. So, my mom was wondering if maybe you and your dad wanted to go to Baskin Robbins with us. Me? With... Yeah. Sure, I think he'd like that. Great. Hey. It's time to say good-bye, chief. I know your name is Rexxx... with, like, a whole lot of X's, but you'll always be Dewey to me. [sniffles] [whining] I'll come visit you real soon. I don't think so, Shane. - Trey... - You promised him. I changed my mind. After being a real hero, he'd never be happy just acting like one. [whimpering] So long, wonder dog. I'll come visit you real soon. [gentle, noble theme playing] [laughing] [people chattering] Take it easy, rookie! That's my new bun warmer. Got it, Joe buddy. Joe buddy? Uh, Mr. Joe... buddy. Sir. You got that right. LIONEL: Oh, my God. It's the Ark of the Covenant. No. This is a fully water-jacketed "we ain't never arriving last on the scene again." That's what this is. Yeah. [phone ringing] I got it. - Too late. - I'm closest. I'm biggest. Dogpatch. Proud home of Engine 55. May I help you? There. Not bad, huh? [alarm sounding] Uh. - I guess we better go. - Yep. DISPATCHER: Engine 55, Ladder Eight, respond. Fuller Road near Hightown Mall. Grass fire. Be advised, heavy smoke reported. Caution on approach. Visibility poor. What's wrong? [rock music playing] [chuckles] [barking] Let's go, Dogpatch! Suit up 40 seconds! - [whooping, cheering] - All right! - Yes! - Awesome! [siren blaring] [horn blowing] You're one strange dog. [grunts] Go get 'em, boy. [man singing rock] Hey, hey! Looks like we got some backup! [laughing] - All right, Dewey! - Yeah, Dewey! - [howling] - Good boy! [laughing] Dispatch, Engine 55 is en route. - Yeah! - Whoo-hoo! SHANE: And that's the tale of the dog who fell from the sky. He wasn't rich anymore or powerful or pampered. But for the first time ever, he was a real dog. He was my dog.
