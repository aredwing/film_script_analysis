It's yours, Judy. - Hello, Hags. - Hello. Look what mother sent me from Louisiana. - What are they? - Pecans. Pecans? Let's open one. Maybe there's a check in it. I had a date but I guess I can get out of it. - Sure. I'll get a girl. - Where is she? - Okay. Who? - Not you. - Come on. Take them off. - Are you speaking to me? You heard what I said. Take off those stockings or I will and... What do you mean? But they're my stockings. They are not. If you think I'm going to give up my lunch to buy you stockings... You owe me a pair anyway. Mrs. Orcutt, Linda's doing a striptease! You can get a bigger crowd on the streets. Why don't you split them? A stocking apiece. From now on, you wear your own stockings or go barelegged. The places you go, it doesn't make any difference. What's the trouble? Are you running a theatrical boarding house or a gymnasium? What's going on here? She accused me of stealing my own stockings. She's swiped her last pair of stockings from me. How do I run a respectable house... You're doing the best you can. I won't be insulted by this little guttersnipe. I'll guttersnipe you! I will not have that in my house. I wish you girls would find some way... to settle your differences. I'll slap her ears flat against the back of her head. - I'd like to see you try. - Come on down here. I wouldn't room with her if you paid me to. Good! That's the best news I've had in the past year. I'm moving in with Madeline right away. It shouldn't take you very long. Everything you own is on your back! If this barroom brawl is over... When I get back to my room, you're all I want to find missing. Heavens, no! At the Footlights Club? Nothing exciting ever happens here. 8:00? You bet. Goodbye. I knew it. Do you want a date? I said, do you want a date? With more of those lumbermen? Am I supposed to apologize for being born in Seattle? The last couple we went stepping with were made of lumber. - Especially their feet. - All right. You can stay here and gorge yourself on lamb stew again. - Pat, want a date? - Wait a minute. Is it for dinner? Why didn't you say so before you spoke? That lamb stew has got me counting sheep at night. You're not so particular about my friends when it's for dinner. They can't step on you when you're sitting down. And you might try being just a little less insulting this time. Me? Insulting to a lumberman? Why, the very idea is preposterous. - Do we dress? - I suppose so. We usually do. I'll be there, my pet. You know me, the lumbermars delight. Mr. Powell's car is waiting for Miss Shaw. - I'll tell her. - Thank you. - Is that for Linda? - Mr. Powell's car. Wait a minute. I'll be the carrier pigeon. Linda! Mr. Powell's car is here! Mr. Powell isn't here! Just his car! Peaceful little haven we have here. Anybody use a couple of tired Tyrolean peasants? - I'll take a couple on toast. - I'll take mine dry. - How was the matine? - Very intimate. We had 100 people on the stage and 50 in the audience. - But you had them outnumbered. - The whole thing makes me sick. What's Gerta sick about? - Five weeks' rehearsal. Two weeks' pay. - What's the matter? Is the show closing? - Like a tired clam. - That's a shame. That's too bad. Let's all go on relief and get it over with. - What would that be? - Mice. How do you get in here? - You might blast! - What? - We don't want any fish! - Go around to the other door! Can't you read? Did you hear that? Another show folding. If they keep on closing, we can move into the storehouse with the scenery. You said it. - Hattie, the mice are back. - Don't go away, taxi. How many doors are there to this place? There's the trap door, the humidor, and the cuspidor. - How many doors would you like? - I only asked a simple question. Did you wish to see Mrs. Orcutt... I want to see whoever I have to about accommodations. Which keeper's on duty today, Hattie? Evidently, you're a very amusing person. If you'll sit over there, I'll get Mrs. Orcutt. She's in the kitchen. Thanks. If you young ladies will pardon me, I shall take the wolfhounds... for a stroll through the park. Need I remind you that Mr. Powell's car awaits without? Maybe if you spoke a little louder next time, everyone could hear you. I'm sorry. I forget that you're old and deaf. If you were more considerate of your elders... maybe Mr. Powell would send his car for you someday. I can hardly wait. He would probably take one look at you... and send you right back. But you have to expect that. Is that so? I could fix you up with Mr. Powell's chauffeur. He has a very nice car, too. But Mr. Powell's chauffeur doesn't go as far in his car as Mr. Powell does. Even a chauffeur has to have an incentive. You should know. I hope you enjoy your lamb stew again tonight. I'll be thinking of you while dining on pheasant bordelaise. Bordelaise, no less! Girls, listen! Or maybe it's casserole. I'm not quite certain. Be sure not to eat the bones and give yourself away. Did you wish to see me? This is a theatrical boarding house, isn't it? - It's considered one of the finest. - I was in doubt for a moment. Are you the person I see about accommodations? Accommodations? Yes, indeed! I hope you'll pardon my appearance. We've had a little trouble in the kitchen. I'll just try and see what's available. - Let's see. Ann and Mary, they room... - I'd like a room with a private bath. Is there anything strange in that request? You mustrt mind the girls. They're just full of fun. We're like one great big family. I may not be able to give you just what you want... but I can put you in a room with a very charming girl, temporarily. That is, until we get a vacancy. How expensive are your rooms? They're $13 if you share a room with a girl. It depends. That seems rather high. Isn't there some reduction by the week? It is $13 a week. - My mistake. - That doesn't include luncheon. The meals go with the $13? Yes, indeed, and I must say we have a very lovely kitchen. I'm sorry. I haven't any change. That's all right. I expect to be here quite a while. What shall I do about my baggage? It's in the taxi. Will you tell Frank to get Miss... - Randall. Terry Randall. ... Randall's baggage out of the taxi? Pardon me. Mrs. Orcutt... has Mr. Hargraves of the guild called me yet? - Why, no. - When he does call... tell him I've read his play and I can't consider it. It is far too trivial. I couldn't consider... - How do you do? - Miss Luther, this is Miss Randall. - She's going to be with us for a while. - How nice. - Are you in the theater? - Not yet, but I hope to be. With proper coaching, there's no reason to despair. L... - If you'll just come with me. - I beg your pardon. Here are your trunks. Take them up to Miss Maitland's room. What's that? That's one of the features of the Footlights Club. It's the chair Bernardt sat in... when she was rehearsing Queen Elizabeth over here. - I was in the company. - You were an actress? Mrs. Orcutt's played with all the stars. She's supported me in lots of my shows, haven't you, dear? That's Bernardt's picture, isn't it? They say she was wonderful. She was very good, very good in some things. As a matter of fact, although it isn't generally known... Bernardt and I had the same coach. I think coaching's a waste of time. After all, acting's only common sense. But that's all a good coach applies, is common sense. If I don't get the right play soon, I may do a little coaching myself. What is this, another boat docking? Mrs. Orcutt told me to put this here. But this is not the storeroom. You'll like this room. Really, you will. Jean, this is your new roommate. Miss Randall, Miss Maitland. We've met before, after a fashion. Jears a very lively girl. I'm quite sure you'll get on very well together. I'm sure of that. - If there's anything you want... - No. I'll be all right, I hope. When does your baggage get here? I'm expecting the bulk of it in the morning. We could leave the trunks here and sleep in the hall. There's no use crowding the trunks. I don't know what we're going to do when the wolfhounds arrive. - I hope you don't mind animals. - Not at all. I've roomed with many of them before. Yes, I can see that. - Fresh kill? - Yes. I trap them myself. - Do you mind if I ask a personal question? - Another one? Are these trunks full of bodies? Just those, but I don't intend to unpack them. I was just thinking if the room got too crowded... we could live in the trunks. Yes, that's a good idea. You don't mind helping me unpack? I beg your pardon. You're not the maid, are you? That's quite all right. What a lovely dress. Whipped up at home by loving hands? Every stitch. - Do you cook, too? - Nothing fancy. Just plain home cooking. I'll bet you could boil a terrific pan of water. I imagine that half that bureau's mine. You don't mind if I put this here, do you? Why not? Help scare the moths away. A friend of the family? Happens to be my grandfather. Grandfather? There is quite a family resemblance, especially around the whiskers. That's a fairly intelligent observation for you. I must say, he's a fairly generous old guy, as grandfathers go. He always treated me very well. I suppose if you'd had your choice... you'd have picked a much younger grandfather. I see that in addition to your charms, you have that insolence... generated by an inferior upbringing. Fancy clothes, fancy language, and everything. Unfortunately, I learned to speak English correctly. It won't be much use to you here. We all talk pig Latin. And I use the right knife and fork. I hope you don't mind. All you need is the knife. Do you mind if I hang these things here? Temporarily, of course. - I must take my bath. - That might help. And remember, half the wardrobe is yours... and if anything of mine should get in the way, just toss it out the window. Did you get a load of that hat? I expected a rabbit to jump out any minute. I thought old Orcutt would fall over in a faint when she handed her that $50. If she had a $50 bill, what's she doing here? It must have been counterfeit. There's no such thing as a $50 bill. I think she's as phony as that bill. - I must have missed some fun. - I'll say you did. When she asked if the meals went with the $13... I thought I'd bust a ligament. Maybe she's a social worker doing a little slumming. - She picked the right place. - Speaking of slum, when do we eat? Wash your necks, children. The lamb's about to be sacrificed. - I should worry. Tonight's lumber night. - I washed my neck yesterday. - So did I. - I refuse to wash my neck for lamb stew. Here's Kay! - Hello. - Any luck today? No, but I've got great news. I actually saw one manager. The whole towrs underwater! Kay saw a manager! - Was it much of an interview? - It wasrt an interview. I just saw him as he rushed out of his office. At least you know there is such an animal. What'd he look like? Like any other animal. He had on pants, tie, and collar... - Did he have hoofs? - Smoke come out of his nose? - That's what gets in your eyes. - Did he say "mama"... - when you squeezed him? - I didn't get that close. You didn't see a manager. What you saw was a mirage. Come and get it! Let's go. Come on, Henry. Mother'll get you some of that lovely lamb stew. Maybe there's a mouse in it. - Coming, Kay? - I'll be along a little later. - Arert you having dinner? - I'm not very hungry. You've been awfully blue lately, haven't you? After playing a whole season in Powell's outer office... he might at least have said hello. It gets pretty discouraging once in a while, but I guess it's all in the game. - Miss Hamilton. - Hello, Mrs. Orcutt. - I'm afraid I must... - I know what you're going to say. If you could let it go a bit longer... You know the rules, and it's three weeks now. I've practically been promised a part and I'm not eating any meals here... You're putting me in a very embarrassing position. I don't want to be inconsiderate. Maybe I could give you a little money on account. - Say $10? - That's something. Thanks awfully. Hey there, Ella! - That's still a community tub. - I'll be out in a minute. You've been in there a half hour. You think you're a trained seal? What'd you say? If you want to drown yourself, why don't you use the ocean? Kay! - Why didn't you say hello to me? - Hello, Jean. I didn't see you. - You certainly couldn't help but hear me. - Don't pay any attention to me. - My mind's been wandering lately. - What's the matter? It's just one of those days. - Let's sit down and have a good cry. - All right. You can cry on my shoulder. I'm going to go bathe anyhow. There's no casting today. "Leave your name and telephone number and we'll get in touch with you later. "Mr. Powell isn't seeing anyone until the end of the week." Last week and the week before, and the week before that. Where did I ever get the idea that I was a good actress? Say, who got all those rave notices a year ago? Yeah, but that was a year ago. - Boy, you do sound gloomy. - I don't know why I'm hanging on. Except there's nothing else I can do and no one I can go back to. Except someone I'll never go back to. Listen, you don't have to go back to anybody. You're the best actress in this whole club. Something good's bound to be coming your way. I hope so... but it had better be soon. I don't mean to be butting into your private affairs... but if it's a matter of a few bucks, I'd be very... Jean, I've got to get that part in Enchanted April. It's been my whole life. It's me. No one else can play that part. It belongs to me. Jean, I've got to get that part! I've got to. Honey, don't cry. - That's all there is. - That's what I call a dinner fit for a king. If you don't care what you say. - I've got most of it caught in my teeth. - Now I know why sheepherders go crazy. It's the lamb stew. If your cat ever turns up missing around dinnertime... I'm eating out that night. I bet Orcutt's husband died of wool poisoning. Coffee tastes of iodine. They should serve bandages, too. It would make a good liniment. I can't tell you how interested I was... in your discussion of Twelfth Night. - It was so intelligent. - Thank you very much. I'm afraid that the rest of the inmates didn't share your enthusiasm. Barbarians. They've had no training, my dear. - Why, when I played in Twelfth Night... - Did you play in Twelfth Night? Yes! I... I've a few of my notices here if you'd care to see them. I'd love to. How lucky. They're right on top. Now, don't read them all, just the bits that are underlined. And this one's from Atlantic City. I don't like to gossip... but that new gal seems to have an awful crush on Shakespeare. I wouldn't be surprised if they got married. - You're fooling. Shakespeare's dead. - No! If he's the same one who wrote Hamlet, he is. Never heard of it. - Certainly you must have heard of Hamlet. - I meet so many people. Hang on to your chairs, girls. We're going to get another load of Shakespeare. Is it against the rules of the house to discuss the classics? No. Go right ahead. I won't take my sleeping pill tonight. It might interest you girls to know... that all great actresses knew their Shakespeare. How about their onions? I fail to see what onions have to do with Shakespeare. If you'd listen to Miss Randall, you might learn something. I like Amos 'rAndy. In my day, we were not only actresses, we were technicians. We learned our trade from the ground up. That's what we should have, a trade. - I want to be a Swiss bell ringer. - I want to do something with my hands. - Sit on them. - You'd get further with your feet. The trouble with you is, you're all trying to be comics. Don't you take anything seriously? After you've sat around for a year trying to get a job... you won't take anything seriously either. Do you have to just sit around and do nothing about it? Maybe it's in the blood. My grandfather sat around till he was 80. My grandfather didn't, and if he and a lot of others... hadrt crossed the country in a covered wagon... there'd still be Indians living in Wichita. Who do you think is living there now? You think you're facing difficulties. What do you think of the men who crossed the Rockies? Did any of them ever try to crash a manager's office? No, but if they'd wanted to, I'm sure they could have... and I bet I can, too. Maybe she can get through the door with vanishing cream. Come on. We'll be late again. The Edelweiss girls must be off. If we're not on the stage by 8:30, the orchestra gets lonesome. Stop it! Can't we ever have any peace around here? Quiet! Olga wants peace! - Peace at any price! - You can't have peace without a war. You sound very superior. What have you ever done in the theater? Everything but burst out of a pie at a Rotarian banquet. You talk as though the world owed you a living. Maybe if you tried to do something for the theater... the theater would do something for you. - What theater? - Is there a theater? I don't know. Has anybody looked up the side streets lately? It doesn't seem to me that any of you take your work very seriously. Now that you're here, we're giving up. At least I will try. If I can act, I want the world to know it. If I can't, I want to know it. Even your best friends won't tell you. It would be a great innovation if your mind... could stretch further than the next wisecrack. I tried that once, but it didn't snap back into place. Miss Randall's right. All you girls want training. - In my day... - When knighthood was in flower. - I beg your pardon? - I'm sorry. I was just reading aloud. Miss Canfield. - Who will we pick on now? - Don't pick on me. - Miss Judy! - Do I hear males? - My lumber gentlemen. No cracks. - Sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic. How do you do, Mr. Dukenfield? Nice to see you again. I manage to get down once a year. - Meet Mr. Milbanks. - How do you do? I've known this little gal since she was that high, in pigtails. - Let's skip that. - Yeah. In those days, nobody ever thought that Pete Jones' daughter... would be an actress. - The odds are still the same. - Yeah. Say, have you got a friend? I have a charming girl for you. Here she is now. Jean, I'd like you to meet a couple of friends of mine. I thought you said they were dressing. Don't start anything here. I'll rinse your bag. - Why didn't they wear their overalls? - Did she say that? Cut it out. Jean, I'd like you to meet Mr. Dukenfield and Mr. Milstream. - Milbank. - What'd I say? Milstream. What do you do, tear down the trees with your bare hands? - I told you she was a kick. - Yeah. - I love a sense of humor. - Yes, I can tell by the size of your shoes. - What? - Ain't she a card? Yeah! You come from Seattle, too, don't you? - Yeah. How did you know? - You can always tell a college man. - I got a taxi waiting outside. - Let's get going. Imagine that, Judy! A taxi! I'll bet you drink champagne out of slippers. - I never have. - Let's go to Central Park. There are trees. We can hang by our tails, eat coconuts. You're killing me. Pleasant little foursome. I predict a hatchet murder before the night's over. - Hello. - How are all your folks? What happened to you? - Nearly everything. - You're limping. Am I? So I am. Did you ever dance with one of those Seattle Romeos? Maybe. I don't remember. - Lf you did, you'd remember it, all right. - Why do you go out with them? I'll bite. Why do I? They not only jump on you, but they bore you to death. I know how many cords of wood there are in a pint... that a pine tree is not deciduous, but has acidosis or something... that the Oregon timberline is receding so fast... that in another 1,000 years or so, the whole state will be practically bald. What am I telling you all this for? Why not? We're going to share the same room. Why not share our troubles? We started off on the wrong foot. Let's stay that way. Don't you ever get tired of quarreling? - What's the matter? Can't you take it? - I can take it if you want it that way. Would you mind if I asked you a very humble question? If you ask it in English. What do you do about air in this room? In the summertime, we do without it entirely. This time of year, we usually open the windows. This thing is stuck. Don't pull it down from the top! We'll have the whole upper floor in our laps. What do we do about the sign? Just leave it there. Don't those blinking lights keep you awake? They will if you lie there and try to out-blink them. We usually use these. What do I do with this? Put it over my eyes? No. You swallow it with a glass of water. That's a very ingenious idea. Thanks. Don't get sentimental. Do you go to sleep right away? Sure, what do you go to bed for? - I thought we might talk. - I've had enough talk for one evening. I suppose you're wondering why I'm living here. Maybe I am. Why don't you sell some of those clothes... and live in a decent place? - Isn't this a decent place? - No. Besides, I've always longed to live in an atmosphere like this. My pet, you haven't seen atmosphere. Wait till about 5:00 in the morning... when those garbage trucks start around. Am I getting good, or are you getting weak? - No. That just struck me as funny. - It isn't very funny to me. If I had your clothes, I'd scram out of here plenty fast... and leave you here with your atmosphere. No, you wouldn't. You bark a lot, but you don't bite. You wouldn't sell out for a wardrobe. It's all right for you to talk. You've got yours. Linda isn't doing so bad, either. Linda? The other girl you fight with. One of them. I don't know. Maybe you two girls have got the right idea. What idea is that? Stop kidding. You mean having a grandfather. Call him whatever you like. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't have a grandfather. Says you. Who's in a better position to give advice... than a woman who allows her grandfather to buy her clothes? What'd you say? - I said, who's in a better position... - Never mind. Write it on a piece of paper and I'll read it in the morning. Down. Up, two, three. Tilt. - Snap the heads over there. - All right. That's enough for today. Go to home. - I thought he'd never call a time-out. - We ought to get him a whip. Get me a wheelchair. Let's run through our routine before Olga gets away. If I'm going to dance any more, you'd better dash home... and get my extra pair of legs. Why not quit running around with those lumberjacks and get some sleep? Will you run through our routine? When am I going to get time for my concert practice? Be a good girl, and when we're famous, we'll buy you a lollipop. All right. - And for this I studied with Kolijinsky. - Come on. Tony Powell. How are you? - Hello, Alex. How's the new school? - Fine. Glad you came up. Thinking of putting on a musical? I probably won't produce anything unless I find an angel. - You haven't seen any flying around here? - No, not lately. Hit it, Olga. Who's the little blonde? Just one of the kids. Want to meet her? Never mind. I'll introduce myself. Look who's giving us the once-over. - Where? - Over there. - Who is it? - Nobody but Anthony Powell. So that's Linda's soul mate. Who's he staring at? I don't know, but I hope it's me. You can have him. You girls rehearsing for a musical? No. We're just getting over the DTs. - Nice routine you've got there. - I hear yours isn't so bad, either. We haven't come to the best part of it yet. What's the matter with your girlfriend? I think she's kind of nervous, you know... meeting a great man like you. - Do I make you nervous, too? - A little. But I wouldn't admit that to you. You two kids expect to go on the stage? We're just sort of hoofing it around. Waiting for someone to discover us. You're discovered. I didn't mean it that way. It's just that we're waiting... for a nightclub engagement. - Something like the Grotto. - The Grotto. I think you'd better excuse me. You are making me a little nervous. Excuse me. You know, there's nothing like a cheerful letter from home. Pa got laid off. My sister's husband has left her. One of my brothers slugged a railroad detective. I guess that's all. "Lots of love, and can you spare $50?" How'd you like that vegetable soup tonight? If it were a little thicker, it would've made nice hot water. If she serves it again, I'll bring a bar of soap... and wash out a few stockings. She must have gotten that meatloaf from the Smithsonian Institute. - I wonder what was in it. - I don't want to know. By way of variety, let's complain about the food. If you werert snooty, you could have had a dinner date tonight. You can have my share of those timber wolves. Timber wolves to you, but to me they're meat and potatoes. Don't you know any younger men? I'm tired of buying dinners for younger men. She needs a good bawling out. - Don't start that again. - Start what? We were rehearsing our routine today... and who should walk up to us but Tony Powell. - So what? - Not the great Anthony Powell? He was very pleasant to us, even wanted to know all about us. And she runs out on him like he was a bed of poison ivy. I didn't like the way he looked at me. You should be glad he looked at you at all. He makes you feel like you ought to run home and put on a tin overcoat. Listen, I'm part of this team... and if you think I'm practicing just to flee from managers... - you're crazy! - You're interfering with my art. He wasrt looking for an act. He was putting one on. You ought to stop at a filling station and get pumped up. She ain't exactly a flat, dearie, just a slow leak. If it's not food, it's men. Can't you talk about anything else? And what else is there? - Hiya, Kay. What have you got? A script? - Yes. Don't you eat here anymore, you lucky girl? Some friends of mine are in town... and I've been seeing quite a bit of them lately. Not some of those tree-chopper-downers, I hope? No. Just people. Pardon me, but there's a dust storm blowing up. How do you do? - Have we met socially? - I hope not. That's a good-looking piece of jackrabbit you got there. It's just a little trinket my Aunt Susan sent over. I think it's unselfish of those animals to give up their lives... to keep other animals warm. They're smart animals. They never give up their lives for the wrong people. You understand the rodent family much better than I do. Incidentally, I saw your Aunt Susan today... and I think you show much better taste than he does. You can think of a bright remark while I answer the telephone. Don't forget Aunt Susars car is waiting for you outside. Hello? This is Miss Maitland speaking. Yes? Mr. Burger? At the Club Grotto? Where? When? Okay. I'll go right over. Thanks ever so much. Call out the Marines, kids! The Depressiors over! What's the matter? Are you going screwy? Come on, string bean! Wake up? Let's get going. That was Gordon from the dancing school. What did he do, propose? No. He said for us to go over to the Club Grotto... and see a man named Burger. He's got an opening in his floorshow. Good there is no opening in the floor. You'd fall in. - What's the excitement? - I'm a stranger here myself. She hasn't worked in so long, if she gets the job... it'll practically amount to a comeback. They never seem to be at a loss for action. It's a little like a three-ring circus. - A little bit. - They're a great bunch of girls. I think so. They don't seem to feel the same way about me, though. You mustrt mind them. I'm beginning to feel that there's something definitely wrong with me. You're different, that's all. Why? I eat the same food, I sleep in the same kind of bed... I've even got a crease across my back from that lumpy mattress... and I'm doing my best to pick up their slang, though I'm not so hot. How's that? "Not so hot." They'll get to understand you after a while. - Maybe you'll get to understand them... - I suppose so. They do make a lot of noise, but it's just to keep up their courage... and hide their fears. What have they got to be afraid of? Certainly they're young enough to have courage. Young enough to have fears, too. You saw how excited Jean and Ann got just now, and that wasrt a job, even... just the prospect of one. You don't know what it means, waiting, hoping... that some manager will interview you. At least you don't have that worry. I saw you in that play last year. You know you're a good actress. I'm not so sure anymore. How do you know who's an actress and who isn't? You're an actress if you're acting... but you can't just walk up and down a room and act. Without that job and those lines to say, an actress is just like any ordinary girl... trying not to look as scared as she feels. Here's something I dashed off in the kitchen I want you to try. - But I've had my dinner. - But this is something extra special. I'm practicing cooking in my spare time. I'm glad that someone in that kitchen is practicing. I'll just leave it there. You may get hungry after a while. If I don't hear any screams, I'll know I'm a success. - Coming. - I told you to wash those dishes. Why do you do things like that? - So that's final? - Yes, Dad, that's final. I'm sorry. I thought by now you might have satisfied this silly whim of yours... and been ready to come back home. If I thought that I couldn't achieve anything by myself... without the aid of the family millions... - I'd be a pretty sorry specimen. - Why must it be the stage? There are other things to achieve. It just happens to appeal to me. Why did Grandfather Randall leave home... and go off pioneering into unknown country? He made sacrifices for a reason... so that his family could have economic security. Security from what? So that I can learn to play a mean game of bridge... or ride to hounds, or marry a polo player? Is that why Grandfather Randall endured all those hardships? But consider the family name. Don't worry about that. As far as New York is concerned... Terry Randall is just another stage-struck girl from the Middle West. They don't know me from Eve. But they're going to, if I have anything to say about it. I'm sorry, but I can't support you in this idea any longer. Financially or morally? If you're going on with this notion, you've got to do it alone. - All right, then I'll have to do it alone. - What if you're a failure? What then? If I'm a failure, I'll be the first to admit it. It may take years to find out. It may take years to know anything, but I'm going to stick to it. Are you too proud to come back home if you are a failure? I haven't got that kind of pride. - You would come home if you failed? - Would you have me? You're pretty stubborn, but you're still my favorite daughter. We'll leave it there. Check, please. Well, hello, Mr. Powell. How are you? So nice to see you again. - Miss Shaw, may I present Mr. Powell? - How do you do? Wort you join us? - I hope I'm not intruding. - Well, I should say not. There we are. How many times have we been introduced? Do you have any idea? Thirty-seven, including tonight. Thank you. I wonder if we're fooling anybody but ourselves. - You're in a very ugly humor this evening. - Don't you like it? If I need a stooge, you might at least get me someone interesting. I hate that word "stooge." I'm retained as an escort. Stooge is good enough. Let's get out of here. I'm bored to death. Why not relax? There are a couple of new numbers I'd like to see. Are you getting interested in new numbers? Shall I join in the conversation just so people think we're together? I think I can get you a job with a ventriloquist. Life is full of surprises. - Couple of cute kids, aren't they? - You think so? I wonder who they are. Just a lot of riffraff they pick up around town. Pardon me. Mr. Powell, you're wanted on the phone. Thank you. I'll be right back. Why don't you two dance? Remember, if you get any wrong numbers, you can always get your nickel back. - Shall we dance? - No. - Did you hear what she called us? - What do you mean "us"? I'll "riffraff" her. I could hit her with this stick. You did everything but poke her eye out. The way that Powell sat grinning at us, I could hit him, too. That's all we need. What do you mean, that's all we need? I heard tonight that he owns half interest in this club. Or did you know that? I thought it was funny that we should happen to get this job all of a sudden. And then came the dawn. Do you think he has anything to do with us being here? Attagirl, Sherlock. You could put two and two together and get something out of it. - So that's it. - Don't be a dope. If he smiled at me tonight the way he smiled at you... I'd do a three-point collapse. - May I come in? - How do you do, Mr. Powell? - L... - Yes, come on in. - I thought you were good tonight. - Thank you. We thought so, too. - Mind if I sit down? - Why not? It's your club. Not exactly. I have a small interest in it. Don't pay any attention to her, Mr. Powell. She's slightly barmy. You don't like me, do you? How could I help but like a man who takes his mother out to a nightclub? - That was your mother sitting with you? - No. That was my friend's mother. - Then I can speak freely? - Go right ahead. Your friend shows very bad taste in picking mothers. I'm beginning to think so myself. Now, my ideal mother is young, blond, slim... and generally intriguing. I'll see if I can get you one for Mother's Day. - How do you like them? Tall, fat, round? - About your size. That wouldn't be so easy. You see, I'm not the stock size. - Couldrt we talk it over at dinner? - I'm very fond of dinner. - Do you suppose you could send your car? - Where would I send it? I'm living at the Footlights Club, but the traffic around there is a bit heavy. - I see. - So you'd better send it around here first. Perhaps that would be better. Shall we say tomorrow night after the show? - Mom will have a lamp in the window. - Good night. No. Mr. Powell isn't in today. Did you have an appointment? Hello? I could wait around if there was any chance... You could wait, but I'm sure there's little chance. Thank you. I'll wait. Hello. I'm sure I don't know. You might call later. No, Mr. Powell's out of town for the weekend. How do you like that? Out of town. I guess that must have been his double... peeking through the door a little while ago. Imagine opening a great big office like this just not to see people. You can go in. Mammy singer? Maybe when Powell left town he forgot to take his shoes with him. - Hello, Kay. - Hello. You'd better sit down. Mr. Powell's out. He's on a world tour. Be careful what you say. He may be hiding under the linoleum. We're kidding. He isn't seeing anybody, except by appointment. I've got one. I'm going to read that part today. - May I touch you? - You'll knock him off his chair. I hope so. I've been studying all night. - Do you have appointments, too? - We're here for Randall. If she doesn't crash Powell's office by 2:00, lunch is on her. We're starting off with caviar. Not that small sturgeon kind, but nice big whale caviar. Miss Hamilton. - Good luck, kid. - The best. I'm sorry, Miss Hamilton. You can't go in now. I tried to get you on the phone. Some unexpected business came up. Mr. Powell will have to cancel that appointment. - I can wait. - It's impossible to see him today. You'll have to make it next week. He'll get in touch with you. If I can only see him for five minutes... I'm sorry. You'll have to make it next week. Please make it today because... because... Here, you mustrt! Somebody catch her! - Get some water! - You get out. We'll take care of her. - I hope it's nothing I said. - Put her on the couch. What's happened? Powell broke an appointment, and when she found out... she went out like a light. - Let me help. - Give me the water. - She'll be okay. - Try rubbing her hands. Come on, darling. You fainted, dear. He's great. Breaks an appointment with an actress to get his shoes shined. - You must remember that Mr. Powell has... - Who does that Powell think he is? - Here. You can't go in there. - Just watch me. - Are you the great Anthony Powell? - Who might you be? - That's not important. - By what right... By what right do you barricade yourself and refuse to see us? - Mind your business. - Do you know a girl just fainted... because you broke an appointment? - Sorry. I didn't know. - Because your door is always closed. You're a producer. You should see them. Why, the greatest actress might be living 15 feet away from you... and you'd never even give her a chance. - Are you the greatest actress? - I don't need you, but the other girls do. They sweat, slave, and go without food in the hope that someday... someone like you will come out and notice them. Sorry, Mr. Powell. She rushed in before I could stop her. Okay. How is the girl who fainted? - Fine. She's going home. - I'll ring when I want you. Thank you. - Sit down, young lady. I want to talk. - Go ahead. - All right, sonny. - Yes, sir. - Sit down. - All right, I'm sitting. Now listen, my militant friend. I judge from your attitude you hold me responsible... for any tragedy in the lives of girls who come up here. Correct? No, but you ought to see them. Maybe they've got something. Maybe they have. Do you realize that if I saw all of the girls, I wouldn't have time for anything else? Every year, about 50,000 girls... Please sit down. - You make me nervous. - I am sitting. Every year, about 50,000 girls decide they want to go on the stage. 49,500 of them are wrong. They'd be better off washing dishes. How about the other 500? Do you see them? No. There are at least 50 girls for every job. Are they the right ones? You don't have the courtesy to go out there and say no to them. That would give them some contact with the theater. You're one that can't complain. You're not the type. You're very smug, Mr. Powell. Whether or not you're satisfied that I'm not responsible... for all of the ills of the theatrical profession... run along and leave me alone with my conscience. I doubt if you have a conscience. Miss Arden, I won't see anybody else today. I don't care who... Is he here? Hello, Mr. Carmichael. Come in. Hello, Mr. Powell. - How are you? - Fine, thank you. I hope this has nothing to do with that other matter. I thought that was settled. - It isn't anything like that. - That's fine. Sit down. - Have a cigar? Cigarette? - No, thanks. No. - We just had a little excitement. - Yes. I couldn't help but hear. - Who was the girl? - I haven't the faintest idea. Some overexcited stage-struck damsel. - Is she an actress? - Lf she is, she's a pretty bad one, I can tell. - Are you sure? - I seldom miss. Something should be done about girls who try to go on the stage. They'd be better off at home raising families. - That's what my client thinks. - Client? - You're producing a new play shortly. - Enchanted April, why? The client I just spoke of is somewhat interested in the theater. I can't mention any names, of course. You know how those people are. Somewhere he got the idea that he'd like to dabble in show business. Fresh money is always welcome. Under the circumstances, I'm not so sure that you would be interested. Under what circumstances? However, here's the proposition. We may as well go over it. Afterwards, if you're still interested, we can go on from there. Hello. No, this is the Footlights Club. Footlights. No, "Foot." How can it be the Beacon Laundry when it's the Footlights Club? Certainly, I'm sure. I'm right in it. Is that so? Go wash your own neck and see how you like it. - How's Kay feeling? - She's all right. - What did the doctor say was wrong? - Malnutrition, he called it. - That's Latin for "not eating." - All she needs is some good meals. Try and get them. And a nice long rest. She hasn't worked in almost a year. That's just the same as a rest. Come here. Shake your head. - Why? - Never mind. Shake your head! Like this? That's what I thought. I can hear it rattle just as plain. - What is... - Nothing. I hope dear old Mr. Anthony Powell sleeps well tonight. What's this I hear about the Randall girl telling him off this afternoon? I didn't hear, but she sure made a lot of noise. It cost us lunch, and I hate to say it, but I am revising my opinion of her. - Has Mr. Powell's car come yet? - I ain't seen it or heard the horn. Maybe that's him now. How is she going to pay her doctor bills? It's all done with mirrors. - Does Miss Jean Maitland live here? - Yes. - Will you give her these? - I'll see that she gets them. Thank you, Hattie. - They're not for you. - I recognize the florist. The boy said they're for Jean. So they are. - Let me take them to her. - Anything to save me from a trip upstairs. Looks like there's a new queen bee buzzing around the hive. It seems to be the same king. - How's Kay? - She's fine. It's so silly of her to have gone without food. Oh, yes, I think it's terribly silly to go without food. I didn't mean it that way. - What did the doctor say? - She's going to be all right. I think it was stupid not to let people know. Sweet of you to send the doctor. - Don't say anything. - Nobody knows. Please don't mention it again. Not that I'm sentimental. It's just that the whole thing seems unnecessary to me. May I come in? Sure. I guess you'll be safe. The exterminators won't be here till tomorrow. How did they miss you last time? I was out in society with an old boyfriend of yours. Speaking of funerals, these flowers just arrived for you. You brought them up? My little flower girl. If I could find my purse, I'd give you a big 5-cent tip. I really came along to give you a tip. Don't bother to read the note. I'll tell you what it says: "Eleven roses and the 12th is you." You're doing very well up to now. Tell me more. His routine's pretty much the same with all the girls. It all ends up with a quiet little supper in his penthouse... with champagne and all the trimmings and the view and all that. And then there's Harcourt. Harcourt's really a gem. That isn't Harcourt you're wearing. No, my sweet. That's a little thing called a star sapphire. Harcourt's the butler. He's very discreet, though. One of those butlers that tiptoes backwards. Yes. I know the type very well. But you'll get to know him much better. And he's very deaf. You really won't have to bother to scream for help. I must tell you about the lighting effect. It's very good. It goes with that "tired little boy" routine. I won't spoil it. I'll let all that come as a surprise. It must be galling to you older women to lose your meal ticket to younger riffraff. Just a leave of absence, dearie, and in the meantime... I have my lovely sable coat and my star sapphire to keep me company. It's lovely, but I'm afraid you paid too much for it. That's your mistake. I'm not as generous as my Aunt Susan. Goodbye. Thanks for calling. If you ever need a good pallbearer, remember I'm at your service. Didrt mean to eavesdrop, but I couldn't help overhearing. You're not really running around with that man Powell, are you? - Why not? - Why play with fire just to spite Linda? - I can take care of myself. - I think you need a governess. Why shouldn't I go out with him? He's very charming. So are snakes. Besides, if I don't go out with him, Ann and I will lose our jobs... and I'll be back where I started from. That's a rather lame excuse. You got along somehow before, didn't you? - I'm sick of that. - Why don't you stick to your ideals? - They're crude, but they're all right. - You should talk! For heavers sake, don't bring up that grandfather thing again. - Besides, it's none of your business. - I'm sorry, ma'am. That's a very beautiful ermine jacket you have on, very similar to one of mine. I didn't expect you back so soon. Don't think I intended to borrow it. I just wanted to see how I'd feel in it. - Do you feel very different? - I'll say. - Why don't you wear it? - Do you mean it? Why not? You may as well go to perdition in ermine. You're sure to come back in rags. You're funny. In some ways, you're not such a bad egg. - As eggs go, I probably have my points. - Thanks. Not at all. Anything for old Seattle. I'm not sure about dinner. Just a minute. What's on the menu tonight? - What do you think? - Don't tell me. I believe I could manage it. Yes, I'll try to get another girl. 8:00. Bye. What the well-dressed roommate will wear. Pardonnez-moi. Look, Henry. That's where you'll wind up if you don't behave yourself. If your line isn't too busy tonight, I have a couple of lumber... No. Don't mention the word "lumber." I am dining tonight on pheasant bordelaise... with peach-fuzz dressing... - Where is bordelaise? - She doesn't even know what pheasant is. Naturally. There's a difference between pheasant and peasant. My friend wouldn't think of serving peasant. No, but he's willing to take them out once or twice. But when he's through, he's through. That's what I love about my friend. It's one thing to borrow a friend's friend. It's another thing to hold him, if you know what I mean. Would you mind telling the lady I don't want to buy anything today? Goodbye, and when I return, I'll tell you how the other half lives. Nice meeting you. If it's not asking too much, let's not be late again. Lead the way, Higgins. You don't suppose she was burned up by any chance, do you? Why don't you two have it out with sharp knives? - Hello, Bill. - Hi, palsie. Hello, Ann. Hello. Make it snappy. We're in a hurry. - What's the matter? - Just a grouch. When did you get back? This morning. Show was a very quick flop... in spite of one of the best press campaigns. No, thanks. Gave it up when I was seven. - Bright girl. Busy tonight? - Yeah. I couldn't give you much time tonight, but how about dinner tomorrow night? - I don't think I can very well. - Why not? Since we've gotten this job, I haven't had much time for anything. - You haven't given up eating, have you? - It isn't that. It's just that... I don't think we'd better see each other for a while. - Why? - I just think it's better, that's all. Oh. - Why do you say "oh" like that? - How would you say it? You make it sound like it meant something else. Does it? - Whatever I do is my own business. - Are you coming, or aren't you? Shut up. Did you eat something sour for lunch today? I'm sorry, Bill, but I've got to live my own life from now on. Sure. But it wouldn't interfere with your life... if I walked down to the corner with you? No, I guess not. That's $50,000 you owe me. What do you want to do? - One shake, double or nothing. - All right, go ahead. We're even. - Did you enjoy your supper? - I didn't dare to. Why not? Makes it too tough to go back to that lamb stew. You don't have to go back if you don't want to. Do you have suppers like this all the time? Practically all the time. Why? Just wondered. I wish I'd been born lucky instead of beautiful and hungry. You can't have everything. But you are beautiful. I'm the lucky one. Will you have a little champagne? No, thanks. I won't be able to stand up as it is. - I knew she was lying to me. - Who? - He isn't deaf at all. - He hasn't been. It just shows you. You can't trust people nowadays. That's right. Don't you want a little coffee? - That's a wonderful view. - Yes, it is. It's a wonderful view. It's a beautiful city. Just like a fairyland. It's full of color, romance, illusion, glamour. Maybe it depends on which window you see it from. You should see it only from here. - Do those lights keep you awake? - So far they haven't. I love New York from up here. It looks all rouged and manicured and ready to go out for the evening. You're quite a little philosopher, aren't you? - It's probably the champagne talking. - Mighty good talk. - That's mighty good champagne. - Let's have more of both. All right. Who are the three little men? They're three figures I picked up in the Orient. Anyone I should know? This one takes care of all good little girls who work very hard for a living. This one sees to it that they meet the right people. And this one... This one went to market. He also sees to it that little girls don't have to eat lamb stew. - Did you pick her up in the Orient, too? - No. That's Mrs. Powell. We're not divorced or anything like that. And that's Junior. Fine-looking boy, isn't he? I never believe in making pretenses. Lots of men who are separated... from their wives let it be understood that they're single. I believe, in this day and age... that a man can have his home on one hand, and still live his own life. - That is, any man of character. - That's big of you. It happens to be the way I believe. - That is very big of you. - Why don't you relax? There's a few things I want to talk over with you. After all, you must be very tired dancing all evening. Here. Sit down right here. That's it. There you are again. I'm glad you're not deaf because if you were deaf... you wouldn't be able to hear anything, and that would be terrible. - Yes, ma'am, that would be terrible. - Sure would be terrible. Yes, terrible. It would be awful. Yes. I never know whether he's coming out or going in. - What happened? - Isn't that more restful? - I thought something blew out. - It does improve the view, doesn't it? It's beautiful. It's beautiful now, but think of how much more beautiful... it'll be when your name is flashing across the horizon. "Jean Maitland" in letters that big. - That big. - All right, that big. It's got to be big enough to keep people awake. It'll be big enough. I'll be the sculptor, and you'll be the clay. I'll mold you into the greatest dancer that Broadway has ever known. I'll be Pygmalion. You'll be Galatea. - Sounds like a fairy story. - Isn't life a fairy story... and aren't grown-up people just little children at heart? I know at the office, I'm gruff Anthony Powell, theatrical producer. That's a pose. Here with you, I'm just a tired little boy with a dream. Who were you supposed to be? You were supposed to be somebody, and I was supposed to be somebody. Pygmalion and Galatea. - And who am I? - You're Galatea. Am I Galatea? Pygmalion was a sculptor who carved a statue of a woman out of marble. The statue was so beautiful that he fell in love with it. And his love was so deep, and tender, and true... that it warmed the statue to life, and they lived happily ever after. Did they get married? No. I don't think people got married in those days. I think that's terrible. - What's terrible? - They didn't get married. - But she was just a statue. - That's what's so terrible about it. You can't cry over that. The whole thing's a merry story. - But look at all the trouble he went to. - He didn't go to any trouble. You're just getting hysterical. Besides, he had a wife and son... and couldn't get married. Harcourt! He should have thought of that. She was minding her own business. You're getting excited. Come on. The coat. I'm not excited, and it may be nothing to you, but it was something to her. - He can't do that to her! - You bet he can't. You bet. Why don't you do something? I'm going to do something about it in the morning. You run along and get some sleep... and don't worry about a thing. My lawyer will straighten it out. What thing? Whatever there is to be straightened out, I'll see that it's done. Don't worry about a thing. - You're wonderful. - Harcourt's right here. He will see you to your car. That's a good girl. - You're wonderful. - Yes. You're wonderful... and I'm wonderful. Harcourt's wonderful. The whole thing is wonderful. You seem to be rather high yourself. You must have had a pretty good time tonight. I'll say. - It was wonderful. - Oh, yes. The view was wonderful, the supper was wonderful. I won $50,000. And Harcourt is wonderful. - And who's Harcourt? - What's his name? - Do you know your own name? - It's going to be in letters that big. - No, that big. - Whose, yours or Harcourt's? You said it. And he's going to divorce his wife and marry Galatea. And who's Galatea? I... She's a statue. She should never have gotten married in the first place. But it's going to be wonderful. Yes, I'm sure that everything's going to be very wonderful. The view is wonderful. - And Harcourt's wonderful, and you are. - And you're wonderful. And I'm wonderful, too. Now, come on. Let me help you take off your things. We're all going to go to the wedding. - You're going to be there, too. - I'll be there. Harcourt's going to marry Galatea... and we're all going to live together in a great big sign. And I feel terrible. But isn't it wonderful? And tomorrow you're gonna have a wonderful hangover... and that won't be so wonderful. It's wonderful. That's my story. How did you get in the theater? How did any of us get in? I've never even been in a theater, except as a spectator. Where'd you first get the bug? It started when I was a little girl. I went to see a circus, and there was a beautiful lady in pink tights. - Wasrt you, was it? - No. I don't like pink. - She was riding a large white horse. - Are you sure it wasrt a purple cow? Whatever it was, here I am, no horse, no job, not even the pink tights. Is Mr. Powell's car calling for you at the Grotto tonight? Mr. Powell's car calls for me every night. I was just wondering. I saw Mr. Powell at the Colonie Bar this afternoon with a young lady. You've done much better than I expected. I didn't think you'd last. Is madame certain she hasn't been seeing things? Madame is quite certain. You'll get a note later saying he's been detained on business. When he doesn't send his car, he sends a note. He's quite courteous that way. This is where I came in. Let's get going. I expect this to be the best play I've ever produced. Every actress on Broadway has begged to play the part of Jeanette. As a matter of fact, it's one of the best parts ever written. Isn't that more restful? On the contrary. It makes me rather uncomfortable. Why don't you relax? Let me tell you the story of the play. - Go ahead. - The scene opens on Long Island. It's a beautiful day in spring... and Jeanette, that's the character I want you to play... is brokenearted. Her husband's about to leave her. Are you sure that you brought me here to discuss the play? Why do you ask? - I'm a rather suspicious person. - You want to be a star, don't you? Under the proper circumstances. Why don't you sit back on the couch? You'll be more comfortable. Would you like to see your name blazing across the horizon... In big letters, but it must be a good-sized sign. I'm used to that. So is Jean Maitland. - What? - Do you love her? - No! - I thought so. She's just a girl I took an interest in. She's becoming more or less of a pest. - Say, what are you, a district attorney? - Not exactly. What has Jean Maitland to do with this? Do you want to play this part? I'm really tremendously flattered, but how do you know that I can act? Because I know. How do you know? You've never seen me on the stage. - And how do you know that? - Because I've never been on the stage. I did see you perform in my office. I wasrt performing that day. Performing or not, I do know an actress when I see one. - How can you tell... - Stop asking questions. - I'd just like to know why... - You don't have to. I talk here. Whether you were acting or no... you showed fire and emotion. That's what I need here. But I'm not an emotional person. You will be when I'm through molding you. I don't want to be molded. I believe in acting with my brain. I'll mold you one of those also. Will you have champagne? - No, thanks. - Mind if I do? Go ahead. - Expecting someone, sir? - Get the champagne. Do you mind if I answer the door? - How did you get up here? - Have you got a woman in this apartment? - Who wants to know? - Who has a better right? See here. I'm in a very bad humor! You get downstairs. How can you shout after all you promised last night? - I'm not shouting! I promised nothing. - Where is she? Say, by what right do you come crashing into this... So it's you! - Hello. - Say, what is this? That's what I'm asking. Mr. Powell was just telling me the plot of a play. So that's how you got on the floor. Get up. That isn't where I left you. What is this? A frame-up? - Tony, darling, control yourself. - Don't "Tony, darling" me! Come on. Get up out of there. And you go home immediately. I'll go when you hear what I've to say. Say it. She came up here to sign a contract to do a play. What's she going to sign it with, champagne? - Call the manager. - You needrt get any manager. I thought I was in love with you, but I see my mistake now. I only went out with you in the first place to spite Linda. Yes, you'd better hide your face, you double-dealing, double-crossing... Darling, I didn't know what I was doing. My own roommate, and you preach ideals, you and your grandfather. Look, I've had enough. Preaches ideals so she can chisel when my back is turned. You can take your old red fox cape. I'll never borrow another thing again from you as long as I live. - Don't try to borrow anything from me. - Don't start that again. I hope you two snakes will be very happy. And you, too, you reptile. Never mind. - What's so funny? - Everything. It isn't funny at all. What is she going to think? Exactly what I want her to think. But why? Why? For several reasons. In the first place, I like her. - She won't like you very much. - She'll see the light in time. You mean you'd jeopardize your own reputation? Arert you a kind of a Girl Scout? Just a girl who uses her brain. Anyhow, I wanted to show you that I can act. - You are a faker. - We're both fakers. Isn't faking the essence of acting? It may apply to actors, but it does not apply to me. You're a bigger faker than I am. - That's libel. - Not if I can prove it. This young mars your son, isn't he? - Please keep my family out of this. - Lf he's your son, he must be elder to you... because that photo has been used to advertise... a certain military academy for a great number of years. How do you know? Because my brother went to that academy. And this lady, whom you pretend is your wife... she's done a lot of posing for the face powder ads, I believe. My friend, you have just broken up a very convenient marriage. I think that we understand each other. - Now, what about the play? - Yes. Where were we? - We were in Long Island. - Yes. The scene opens on Long Island. It's a beautiful day in spring, and Jeanette, that's the character... - Yes. That's me. - That's right, is brokenearted. She's about to lose her husband. Not exactly the way I just lost my wife, but... She's coming. Where is everybody, Hattie? Where do you want them to be? Madeline told me someone down here wanted to see me. If there's somebody here to see you, we'd better turn on the lights. Enough confetti. I've got to sweep it up! It's for you, Ann. - I feel like crying. - No. I don't... No speeches at this banquet, you sit right here. You're the guest of honor. I see you remembered the right number of years. We won't tell, if you don't tell on us. Take a big blow and make a wish. No. Wait. I have to turn the lights off. Make a wish. - Quiet, everybody. - And don't tell us. That's fatal. I guess everyone knows what it is without my telling. It's coming true. I can feel it in my bones. She made it. It's so beautiful, I hate to cut it. That's one of Hattie's. Maybe you can't. I resent that! Be careful you don't drop it on your foot. - Girls, I have the most wonderful news. - Maybe the house is on fire. I've just been talking to Terry Randall. - What's wonderful about that news? - Maybe she's had an accident. She's going to play the leading part in Anthony Powell's new play. - Randall? - Isn't that exciting? And I've only been coaching her such a short time. Maybe that's why she got the part. - Which play is she going to do? - His new play. - Enchanted April? - Yeah. - The part of Jeanette? - Isn't it hard to believe? Perhaps you girls will change your opinion of Miss Randall after this. Perhaps you'll change your opinion of me, too. And perhaps you'll pay more attention to your theatrical training. Poor kid. We can't even have a birthday party... without Randall or something else crabbing it. Why don't you leave Randall alone? She hasn't harmed anyone. No, but she always looks like she's ready to start. Olga's right. She hasn't harmed anyone. All she did was steal the part you wanted to do. It wasrt my part because I wanted it. Last year I took a part away from a girl. - No. This is different. - It isn't different. Isn't there enough heartache in the theater without our hating each other? - You're crying. - I'm crying because I'm happy. I've had my moments in the theater, and I think Terry deserves her chance. If you say anything to her, that won't get the part for me. There's going to be other parts and other plays. This is my birthday, and I'm going to be happy. The devil with the theaters. All right, folks. Places, please. We'll take this scene over again from the beginning. Go right ahead. Go ahead. Here she is now, coming up the garden path. - What are we going to say to her? - I don't know. The poor child. She's probably brokenearted. You'd better let me talk to her first. Well? Come on, Miss Randall, this is your cue. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were rehearsing again. In the theater, we are supposed to come in on cue. But there are some men out there fooling around. Would you ask them to stop? We find it necessary in the theater... to have men fooling around with ropes and things. If you'd just pay more attention to your cues... and not contradict, you might do better. - You needrt be sarcastic about it. - I apologize deeply. - Now get out and come in on cue. - All right. Don't get excited. I just can't hear anything with these people. All right. Go ahead. The poor child. She's probably brokenearted. You'd better let me talk to her first. Hello, Mother. Hello, Dad. Hello, Kate. The calla lilies are in bloom again. Such a strange flower, suitable to any occasion. I carried them on my wedding day, and now... I place them here in memory of something that has died. He needs a good thrashing. You poor child. Are you gathered here to mourn, or to bring me comfort? There's still something not quite right about that line. You might read it correctly. That would help. I don't see why you should object to an intelligent suggestion. I've written several important plays. One of them received the Pulitzer Prize. Have you written any plays? There's an old saying that you don't have to be a hen to know a bad egg. There's nothing wrong with the play. I'll explain the scene to you again. This womars husband has decided to leave her, and she's brokenearted. Can you understand that? Yes, I can understand that, but you told me to be sophisticated. On the surface. But inside here, your heart is broken. There's a smile on your face, and you're crying in your heart. I don't see how you can do two things at the same time. I refuse to sit quietly by and see my play butchered. As long as everyone is putting in their two cents won'th somewhat promiscuously... I should like to remind you that I have a Broadway reputation to consider. I don't see what your reputation has to do with our conversation. - Give me a light, will you? - Miss Randall. I'll have to ask you to pay attention to the director. What am I supposed to do? Walk around like a puppet or use my intelligence? You're to do as you're told! - Don't yell at me! - I am yelling at you! If you think I'm so terrible, why did you hire me for the part? That's what I'd like to know! Temporary insanity, probably. Now go ahead and do as you're told! - Well, I... The... - Go ahead and do it! I am doing it, but the only thing that I'd just like to... - How long have you been coaching her? - I've only had her a month. No one could possibly get that bad in a month's time. - Would you mind a suggestion? - Anything, please. I was wondering, could you possibly see an older woman in the part? I don't know what to do. Where's this fellow Carmichael? I've got to get out of this. - He should be here any minute. - There he is. Hello, Mother. Hello, Dad. Hello, Kate. The calla lilies are in bloom again. - Mr. Powell, how's everything? - I've got to get out of this contract. - I'm afraid that's impossible. - Who is this mysterious client of yours? The head of some combine trying to ruin me? You listen to this rehearsal, you'll understand. Isn't she turning out as well as you expected? She has possibilities, but right now she's an amateur. As emotional as a fish, and she's a nuisance in the bargain. She questions everyone: The director, the writer, the actors. I don't see how this play will be anything but a flop. Is that so? - You seem to be pleased about it. - After all, it's my client's money. I'd give you the money back if you let me out of the contract. I'm sorry. Is your client by any chance in love with this girl? To tell you the truth, I believe he is. It takes all kinds of people to make a world. - Mr. Powell! - Coming. I still don't understand anything he says. He tells me to laugh and cry at the same time. - I don't know what... - That's plain to be seen. - Let's get this organized. - Go ahead and get it organized... Do you think my dress is fancy enough to wear to opening night? For Randall's opening, you ought to wear black. She was nice enough to give us free tickets. She wanted to be sure someone was in the audience. "The night was growing old As she trudged through snow and sleet "Her nose was long and cold And her shoes were full of feet" Look. Don't you like my dress? - Don't you think it's pretty? - Where'd you get that? - Your mother send it from Louisiana? - Yes, she makes all my clothes. - What are those things there? Pecans? - No. Just doodads. Got to have 35 cents. - For what? - For Terry's flowers. - Don't make me laugh. - Come on, cough up. We've only got $3.85. We need as much as we can get. All right. I'll give $1 if it's for her funeral. She tries harder to hate people than anyone I know. - Here, keep the change. - Wait a minute. You're so fond of feuds, you should live in the Kentucky mountains. We haven't much time to eat. Got to stop at the florist. This will be my 35th performance as spectator. Cheer up, Mary Lou. Someday people on the stage will watch the audience, and you'll be a sensation. So long, string bean. I shall see you at the theater. You're not going to catch the opening tonight? I'm going tomorrow and catch the closing. You talk as though you want her to be a flop. No, but as long as she's a flop, I'm going to be there and see it. She's sore because Terry took my boyfriend away from her. - What do you mean boyfriend? - Tired little boyfriend. Someday I'll be lucky and run into you when I'm carrying a bowl of goldfish. Get me. Ain't I the one? Look at her. Will you sew me into this? I'll get out of it myself. - You look all dressed up. - I am dressed up. - Are you going alone? - Not Mackintosh. I got a beau. - Who? - The butcher's helper. He was a little hard to break down. After I told him I had passes, he nearly cut his thumb off. Why can't I get a butcher? Be still, my heart. Maybe that's him now. Hattie, this is your night. You've got to make an entrance. I'll get the door. Hattie, have a heart. - Hello. - Hello. It's raining. - Is that what it's doing? - Kind of wet. Rain usually is this time of year. Hattie will be right out. Butch, meet Miss Farnsbarn, Miss Fannisbess, Miss France. - How'd you know my name was Butch? - Same way you knew it was raining. Butch, there's something I want to talk to you about. One of these days when Hattie comes to the market... to get some lamb, if your hand slipped a little chicken in... Isn't he handsome? Some people do things like that for others. Others do things like that for some people. I think you should do it, don't you? - Why don't you come in and get the meat? - I will. I was downtown the other day. I was telling the girls that I saw you. By the window with your white coat on, looking wonderful. I'd like to turn my back on you when you're holding knives. Butch is wonderful. He promised when you shop... to get some chicken all mixed up in the lamb. No, I didn't exactly. Hattie, don't do anything Butch wouldn't do. I'll do something for you sometime. I'll poison your soup. Butch, you got a friend? He says no. The calla lilies are in bloom again. Such a strange flower, suitable for every occasion. I carried them on my wedding day, and now... I place them here in memory of something that has died. Cue from him. Are you gathered here to mourn or have... I thought I told you to rest. - I can't remember a line. - Of course you can't. Nobody can an hour before curtain time on opening night. When you put your foot on that stage, it will all come back, as if by magic. - Suppose they don't come back? - They'll come. Somehow they always do. - No, I couldn't. Thank you. You're sweet. - Dear, I'll leave the tea here. The calla lilies are in... I can't remember that. Calla lilies are in bloom. Such a strange flower... They seem to be useful on... I don't know what in the dickens they're useful on occasion. I'll never be able to remember. Kay. The doctor told you to stay in bed. I'm not going to stay in bed with all this excitement. But you mustrt disobey orders. I was coming to see you before I left. Keep her cheerful, Kay. She's got first-night nerves. You've had them. I must hurry and get my... Your coat and galoshes are there. Yes. Thank you. - And don't let her do any more rehearsing. - I'll sit on her. It would be raining in the bargain. It's that first speech. If I could only get through that, I'd be all right. Would you mind watching, Kay? The calla lilies are in bloom again. Such a strange flower, suitable to any occasion. - May I make a suggestion? - I wish you would. The way you hold the flowers. I've always thought that Jeanette would hold them as she would a child. - They never had a child, you see, and... - I see. Do you suppose that's what the author intended? I'm sure he did. And when she says, "In memory of something that has died," she... Kay, you know this play. It's not a play. It really happened to someone I know. Darling, you mustrt do that. This isn't just your night. It's my night, too. You've got to be a success tonight. You've got to give a great performance. - No matter what happens. - Is something the matter? No, I'm just excited, that's all. Here, you sit down and I'll get you some tea. The condemned woman drank a hearty supper. I felt the same way. I felt like running and hiding from everyone... but after that opening speech, there's a thrill you'll never forget. It's a thrill that only comes once. Thrill? I can't make out whether it's a thrill or agony. It's both. Arert you ready yet? Come. We'll have to hurry. - Here I go. - The opening night, you know. Be quick, dear. - Wish her luck, Kay. - Yes, darling, wish me luck. Goodbye. I want to give you this. A girl gave it to me last year on my opening night. It brought me luck. Darling, you're sweet. I wish you were going to be there to hold my hand. I'll be there. In spirit. Are you coming, or are you not? Here she comes. - Good luck. - Goodbye, Terry. Five minutes to curtain. Five minutes, Miss Hamilton. Don't worry, Miss Hamilton. Everything's going to be fine. Places, now. Places, please. Ready, everybody. Are you ready, Miss Hamilton? It's a bought-out house. Everybody's out there! You haven't a thing to worry about. - Good luck. - All right, now. Stand by, please. Everybody in their places, now. Ready, Miss Hamilton? Did you hear that? That's all for you. This is your night. Who's that? Kay. It's Kay. She jumped before I could stop her. She's lying out there in the rain. Calling Car 19. Go to 87 West 58th Street. Ambulance call. Girl leaped out window. Possible suicide. Morris talking. - Good evening, Mr. Powell. - Good evening. - Looks like a packed house. - Because they don't know what's in store. Looks like the boyfriend. - This is a very bad place to stand. - Why? We'll be trampled to death when they start running out. Poor darling. You shouldn't have told her. She isn't responsible for Kay's act. She is responsible. It was Kay's part. It was Kay's life. But now it's too late. Kay is dead. - Please. - Kay is dead. Kay, who never harmed anyone. It's all because she hasn't a heart, she's made out of ice. - I can't listen to you anymore. Leave. - I'm leaving. I will sit out front because Kay asked me to be there. And then every line she reads... I'm gonna say that should have been Kay's line. Every move you make, I'll say that should have been Kay. Kay, who's lying in a morgue all broken and alone. I dare you to go on tonight. - I've got to get out of here. - You've got to go on. Why didn't someone tell me? I'd have given up a thousand parts rather than have this happen. I'm not going to go on and I'm going to tell them why. You can't think only of yourself. Kay is dead. You had nothing to do with that. But there are 50 living people dependent on you. This show may mean as much to them as it meant to Kay. The ushers, the property men, the old women who clean out the theater. Each one has the right to demand that you give your best performance. That's the tradition of the theater. Hang the tradition of the theater. I'm thinking of Kay. Very well, then, think of Kay. Are you going to let her down? You've got to give the performance she wanted you to give. Then perhaps, wherever she is, you may bring her peace. Three minutes to curtain. - Miss Randall, three minutes to curtain. - All right. We're coming. We're ready. Pick your exit. It won't be long now. Here she is now, coming up the garden path. - What are we going to say to her? - I don't know. The poor child. She's probably brokenearted. You'd better let me talk to her first. Hello, Mother. Hello, Dad. The calla lilies are in bloom again. Such a strange flower. Suitable to any occasion. I carried them on my wedding day, and now... I place them here in memory of something that has died. He needs a good thrashing. You poor child. Have you gathered here to mourn, or are you here to bring me comfort? How could a girl like you fall in love with a man like that? I've learned something about love that I never knew before. You speak of love when it's too late. Help should come to people when they need it. Why are we always so helpful to each other when it's no longer any use? My darling. - Those are not the lines. - No, but it's the mood. This is my home. This is where I belong. Love was in this house once. And for me it will always be here, nowhere else. - Surely you're not going to see him. - Of course, I'm going to see him. He's coming to me today to say goodbye. And one should always listen closely when people say goodbye. Because sometimes they're really saying farewell. I'm up at the theater in Powell's private office. Get a couple of photographers over here right away. This Randall girl's going over big. Hear the applause? Did you hear it? And wait till I tell you who she is. This is plenty hot. Love comes back to its ancient dwelling. The old, old love that we knew of yore. Terry Randall! What did I say? Come on. - Hold it. - Take a bow. - They're calling for you. - Who's calling for me? - You are a success, darling. - They want a curtain speech. Yes. Go on. Say something. I suppose that I should thank you on behalf of the company. And I know that I'm grateful to you for your applause. But I must tell you that I don't deserve it. I'm not responsible for what happened on this stage tonight. The person you should be applauding died a few hours ago. A young and brilliant actress who could no longer find a spot in the theater. And it was for her, more than for anyone else, that I was able to go on. And I hope that wherever she is... she knows and understands... and forgives. That's the oddest curtain speech I ever heard. - Hello, Powell. - How'd you like the show? A little heavy, but the girl's good. What in the name of time was that curtain speech all about? I don't know, but she's a sensation. And guess what? - What's that? - That guy with Carmichael is her father. And the laugh's on us. - He's Henry Sims, the wheat king. - Wheat king? What a publicity hookup. Don't worry. I spread it around. There's the old man now. Carmichael, why are you looking so blue? We've got a hit on our hands. - That's what I'm afraid of. - I never doubted it. Introduce me. - Yes. Mr. Powell... - Glad to know you, Mr. Sims. You didn't fool me. I knew who your daughter was. To be honest, this hasn't worked out the way I expected. Your investment will net you $250,000. What good will that do me if I lose my daughter? That's the price of success. Brent, get a big basket of flowers, send it to Randall's dressing room. Put this on top. Hurry it up. - Shall I put a few sprigs of wheat in it? - Never mind the sarcasm. Elswon'th. You're the man I'm looking for. I kind of put it over on the boys, didn't I? - You mean the wheat king's daughter? - Yes. - She doesn't need the publicity. - That's why I kept it quiet. She has rather a strange quality. Reminds me a lot of that girl you brought out last year. - Yes? - What was her name? Hamilton. - Kay Hamilton. What happened to her? - She's still around. Mention in your review that Randall is another Anthony Powell discovery. My dear, you'll never know how good you were tonight. You were simply wonderful. That wasrt me out there tonight. It was someone else. It's only after we have suffered that we can make the audience feel with us. Does someone have to die to create an actress? Is that what the theater demands? It takes more than greasepaint and footlights to make an actress. It takes heartbreak as well. Don't try to say anything. We'll go to her. - Where are you going? - We're going to see Kay. But you can't leave now. There are people here. The press, photographers. You're an actress now. You belong to those people. May I come in? - You see them for me. - But, Terry, I... - Hello. Anyone there? - Coming. I thought you'd never let me in. - Where's Miss Randall? - She's gone. Gone? But I've got an office full of people: Reporters, society editors, photographers. Why didn't you keep her here? You know the theater. - She had an important engagement. - An engagement? - What's more important than her career? - It isn't my fault. Of all the colossal nerve. I build a star overnight, and she runs out on me. I've got an office full of people, and she runs off on a date. - What'll I do with these? - I don't care what you do with them. Wait a minute. Can you imagine? Of all the nerve. Take a woman out of a wheat field... and make a star out of her. I don't deserve any better. Opening night, too. That's gratitude for you. Spend time and effort to build a production, and they run out on you. I haven't any sense to begin with. Don't take it so hard, Eve. It all may be a mistake. I'll never put my trust in males again. What's happened to Eve? She's brokenearted. Henry's in the cat hospital. - An accident? - He just had a litter of kittens. That's easy. Change his name to Henrietta. - I'm completely discouraged. - The miracle has happened. - Mary Lou's got a part. - No! Where? Bergers new show. The southern accent did it. I'm so thrilled I want to scream. - Do you feel better? - Read your part, Mary Lou. I'm supposed to be a girl from the South, and I'm with a lot of other girls... and I say, "Let's go up to Westchester." Go on. - That's it. - That's it? You don't read it right. You should say, "Let's go up to Westchester." No, Jean, that's all wrong. You've got to say, "Let's go up to Westchester." Let's go up to Westchester. Hey, everybody, here comes that blushing bride. Goodbye, everybody. I got to catch a 6:00 train. Thanks for everything and the shower and all. If any of you hams happen to come to Seattle... the house of Milbanks is always open to you. I thought the people there lived in trees. Only in the summer. In the winter, we live in burrows. She'll be right there. Your bridegroom won't hold that taxi if you don't hurry. Goodbye, everybody. Now that I'm going, I feel like having a good cry. You should weep. It's the first job you've had in a year. We're all going to come to your wooden anniversary. Come on. Heave. Go back to Seattle. Send us an old wooden shoe, maybe. Poor kid. Why she hated to leave a dump like this is a mystery. I know how she feels. To me it would be like leaving the house where I was born. At least she'll have a couple of kids to keep her company in her old age. And what do we have? Some broken-down memories... and an old scrapbook, which nobody will look at. - We're probably a different race of people. - Maybe. Tonight I feel like sitting out in the moonlight... having somebody hold my hand. Good evening. Who do I see about accommodation? - Miss Orcutt! She'll take care of you. - Thank you. Hello? Hello, Bill. Don't be sentimental. Remember, you're a ham at heart. No, that wasn't me. That was a friend of mine. How's the new job coming on? Would you like me to carry a message to your late Aunt Susan? Hold on. Gangrene just set in. No message. I don't use that kind of language. I just thought I'd ask. I just wanted to know if maybe... I think you'll be interested in this. It's one of the features of the Footlights Club. It's the chair Bernardt sat in when she read Queen Elizabeth over here. I think you'll like it here. We're one great big family. I'll show you your room. I hope you don't mind sharing.
