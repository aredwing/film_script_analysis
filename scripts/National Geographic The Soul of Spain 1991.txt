But the saga of Juan Carlos is distinctly modern When he became king in 1975 he took the reins of government from Europe's last fascist dictator He was to inherit a land touched by forces unlike the rest of Europe... a land chosen by destiny to become the greatest power on earth... then doomed to lapse into decades of decline and stagnation In the extraordinary reign of Juan Carlos Spain has leapt into the 20th century Un, dos, y... But as new ideas concepts, and values flood in the Spanish people cherish the ways that are uniquely theirs Mindful of the grandeur of their past even as they create a new unknown future they nurture and treasure the timeless traditions that illuminate the Soul of Spain Spain. Dramatic, mysterious, complex Greatness and tragedy resonate in its soul It gave the world the essence of chivalry in Don Quixote... the quintessence of cruelty in the Inquisition Long after the rest of Europe industrialized Spain remained poor and agrarian Hereditary noblemen and wealthy families still owned much of the land controlled it by the laws and privileges of their class Inward looking the people proudly clung to their ancient heritage, customs, and beliefs Who are they? Where did they come from? What shaped the Spanish soul? Lying astride the Atlantic and Mediterranean on the Iberian Peninsula Spain has been called "that country ripped from hot Africa soldered crudely to inventive Europe First settled by wandering tribes from Europe and North Africa it would be colonized by Phoenicians Carthaginians, and Greeks By 19 B.C. the triumphant Romans dominated the peninsula They would leave their indelible imprint of architecture, law, and language Later, Roman missionaries would introduce Christianity Led by Arab warriors in 711 Berbers from North Africa swept into Spain Soon their rule and Muslim religion gripped the land Working side by side Muslim, Christian and Jewish scholars relit the torch of learning that led Europe out of the Dark Ages Cordoba, capital of Muslim Spain became Europe's most cultured city boasting half a million inhabitants when London and Paris were only villages But through the eight centuries of Muslim rule the Christians waged war to reconquer the land until only Granada survived as a Muslim stronghold In 1492 the last Muslim king surrendered his crown to the Catholic sovereigns Ferdinand and Isabella Through war and Inquisition Spain would expel not only the Muslims but all Jews who refused to be baptized Seeking a westward route to the riches of India Ferdinand and Isabella would provide Christopher Columbus with financial support On the 33rd day of his voyage Columbus landed in the New World and claimed it in the name of the Spanish crown Spain would conquer huge empires in the Americas Gold wrested from native peoples would finance wars in faraway Europe... and Spain would become the world's mightiest power But two centuries later its navy defeated its empire in shambles Spain's era of supremacy was over A long eclipse had begun With the Second Republic torn by political turmoil Spain is plunged into bloody civil war An alliance of army officers, monarchists and the Catholic Church joins the fascists in rebellion They are supported by Hitler and Mussolini in a conflict that becomes a dress rehearsal for the Second World War The death toll from combat and executions will cost the nation half a million lives With the fall of Madrid General Francisco Franco commander of the victorious Nationalist troops assumes powers greater than those of any monarch in Spain's history Nationalist, rightist, and authoritarian the dictator Franco embarks on 36 years of repressive control When World War II rages across Europe the wily Franco manages to keep Spain out of the conflict The role of women remains static circumscribed by church tradition and male domination Physically shattered and spiritually crippled in the long aftermath of war the nation will need years to heal Franco orders construction of the Valley of the Fallen to commemorate the Civil War dead Although named E1 Caudillo The Leader for life he knows that someday he too will find his final resting place here Believing a monarchy would best serve Spain Franco selects as his successor the grandson of the last king Born in exile Juan Carlos first set foot on Spanish soil at age ten His father legitimate heir to the throne had acquiesced to Franco's desire to educate the boy The prince would spend four years in the Army, Navy and Air Force academies attend university and complete his studies at a number of government ministries The nation observes the end of an era For nearly four decades Franco had made all of Spain's important decisions Juan Carlos, rarely seen except in Franco's shadow was perceived to be molded in his image Would the nation again erupt in rebellion? Juan Carlos swore his allegiance to the constitution and the people "Desde la motion en el recuerdo Franco, viva elrey!" Viva! Viva Espagna! Viva! Perceptive and intelligent he had privately concluded Spain must embark on a new course secretly he had prepared himself for it To everyone's surprise he deftly led his people from dictatorship to democracy A king who pays taxes lives modestly and is an avid sports enthusiast he soon became the most popular man in the country His greatest test came in 1981 when parliament was invaded by Civil Guards commanded by a right-wing colonel As an amazed public watched on television the colonel called for a return to a Francoist regime Working through the night as parliament was held hostage the king obtained pledges of loyalty from his principal military leaders and quelled the attempted coup His reassuring address to the people included these words The Crow... cannot tolerate actions attempting to interrupt by force democratic process Under his leadership a vital and dynamic New Spain has become an economic success story The nation is an eager new member of the European Community Its thirty-nine million citizens have a higher standard of living than ever in their history And there is freedom of religion, of expression The repression of old has evaporated A burst of growth has transformed the nation Every year Spain attracts 50 million tourists more than the country's total population They bring billions of dollars new ideas and customs The Spaniards once Europe's poor relations have become conspicuous consumers But behind the facade of modern Spain echoes of an older way of life still resonate In the same year that Franco died so did Don Fernando de la Camara one of the wealthy landowners who had supported the dictator Camar's presence can still be felt in the Seville apartment where his heir, Rocio, lives She is now head of her family's agricultural business As her father did Rocio grows wheat and sunflowers and raises bulls to fight in the ring Every year the new calves are rounded up for branding In this tough and traditionally male-oriented atmosphere Rocio has found acceptance Of course it's harder being a woman but society is changing and nowadays there are no real problems, big problems If I were a man I'd wrestle those calves but as a woman, I can't But there are many important things to do on a ranch where being a woman makes no difference at all Diego Reina has been employed by the Camaras for more than 20 years He helped raised Rocio and when her father died continued as foreman He has had other job offers but he respects and admires Rocio He says he will never leave. Unlike his peers of 25 years ago Diego receives an adequate income has his own house and can look forward to retirement with social security Today Diego has the right to vote but like many others still prefers the old ways Personally, I felt more at ease under Franco than now Nobody bothered anybody You could bed down in the fields anywhere Now you can't In the last few years before Franco died life was peaceful in the country We ate well in the country and we could save a peseta or two Who saves anything nowadays? Whether Juan, Pedro or Antonio is in charge the land is the same We live off the land and die for the land It's always the same, always the same Diego's land is Andalucia In this southernmost region of Spain under a brilliant sun and sky olive trees and vineyards have thrived for thousands of years Only here in all the world in a small area of chalky moisture-retaining soil is true sherry wine produced In 1730 a French farmer founded a sherry dynasty in the town of Jerez de la Frontera Today, the heirs of Pedro Domecq are the second largest producers of sherry in the world part of an elite referred to as "sherry barons" Still, even at age 77 Jose Ignacio Domecq enjoys driving to work on a second-hand motorbike purchased from his chauffeur At the manor house that overlooks some of the Domecq vineyards he meets his eldest son The manor was built around an ancient tower used during the Middle Ages to send smoke signals to Africa only 65 miles away It provides a vantage point from which the Domecqs can confer about the 4,300 acres of vineyards they cultivate here One day the younger Jose Ignacio will take control of their wine and brandy empire is Spain and the Americas Domecq produces 10 million liters of sherry annually The most vital element in creating a distinctive sherry is the human factor... specifically, the human nose In the bodegas where sherry matures the Domecqs exercise the delicate skill which has made the family masters of the art of wine making for 250 years We maintain our standardization of quality throughout the different generations My father is known in the wine world... ...for the nose not only because of the size of it that is you have seen rather big but because he's considered one of the... ...most important specialists in Europe in the science of wine The unique quality of sherry derives from the solera system New sherry is blended with more mature sherry to take on its characteristics Fortified with grape brandy and repeatedly blended it ages in oak casks until it reaches maturity The most venerable bodega holds casks of rate sherry dedicated to the famous Among them is one once reserved for George IV King of England A cask was dedicated to Napoleon in 1812 And after the battle of Trafalgar Admiral Lord Nelson's body was shipped to England perfectly preserved in a cask of brandy and sherry At his nearby estate one of the 500 relatives who are shareholders in the Domecq corporation indulges in another family passion For 20 years Alvaro Domecq like his father before him was famed for his prowess in the Spanish art of bullfighting on horseback Today, he raises fine Andalucian horses and hulls to fight in the ring Bullfighting was once the leisure pastime of gentlemen on horseback Farmhands assisted with their capes Modern bullfighting performed by professionals on foot began only two centuries ago Bullfights are the highlight of the annual April Fair in nearby Jerez For this special event six local breeders each enter a superior bull in the competition for Best of the Year Domecq is here sharing the crowd's anticipation and hoping his bull will bring honor to the family's reputation as breeders Victor Mendes the matador who will face that bull prepares for his test as he dons the traditional suit of lights The bullring manager and other well-wishers come bearing the only protection they can offer "Suerte" good luck As his sword handler makes final adjustments Mendes reflects on the trial ahead It's now a fight or game between the rational and the irrational if is possible to arrive to the death the death of the bull But sometimes, the death of the man To the Spaniard the bullfight is not a game but a revered ritual not a sport but an art Its origins can be traced to pagan sacrifices and to ancient Greek and Roman games In its beauty, glorification of bravery and disdain for death the bullfight embodies traditional values of Spanish life More than spectacle this is mythic theater in which the drama of life and death is reenacted culminating in the predictable but by no means certain death of a noble beast. In recent years it has lost popularity and there is increasing disquiet among a minority of Spaniards about the morality of their "national fiesta But for some it remains an irreplaceable thread in the fabric of their heritage As the afternoon turns to evening crowds begin to gather at the fairgrounds In this weeklong celebration women wear traditional Andalucian dresses friends meet, sip sherry, make music, and dance The region of Extremadura in western Spain has always been harsh and ungiving For decades Azuaga like many small agricultural and mining towns has slowly but steadily lost its population The future looks bleak unless young people can be persuaded to stay Among the few professionals here is a husband-and-wife team of doctors assigned to the local clinic Their 16-year-old daughter, Alicia feels trapped in the stifling atmosphere This is a small town There isn't much for me to do I'm not sure whether so stay or leave I'll probably leave but I still haven't decided The lack of entertainment career opportunities even participation in sports all make teenagers yearn for greater freedom The old ways hold no allure for the young generation When Alicia's parents accept job offers in Seville she is thrilled to go with them She will become one of the thousands who seek new lives in big cities Spain's new constitution carefully spells out the equality of opportunity for men and women After high school Alicia hopes to join the growing ranks of working women "Then after a couple of years when I've mastered that job I'll study business management and after that join a big company I'd work my way to the top and eventually have my own company As a businesswoman I'd travel I'd like to travel a lot in my work Today, many women are entering the ranks of leadership in government politics, and commerce The unemployment rate of women is twice that of men But like Alicia they pursue an alluring dream Spain's greatest contemporary poet Garcia Lorca described flamenco as deeper than the heart of the one creating it and the voice singing it It comes from the first sob and the first kiss Flamenco was born in Andalucia when Arabic and Spanish music mingled with the songs of the Jews The gypsies were to adopt it and in their wanderings carry it throughout Spain Francisca Sadornil La Tati as she is known was born here in Madrid She learned flamenco dancing from gypsies married a gypsy in her youth and remains among the rare outsiders accepted by them artistically and socially A professional dancer from the age of 12 La Tati has dedicated her life to flamenco And flamenco has taken La Tati from a working-class neighborhood to the concert stages of the world She reminisces I can't remember a time when I didn't dance I was born on Toledo Street and there all the neighbors were Andalucians and gypsies At No.5 of the Plaza de la Cascorro was Quica the dancing professor of Seville I went to Quica when I was about seven I never paid for a dancing class because there was not money in my family I slept at the academy on a mattress between chairs I helped Quica clean the academy and did the errands and this way I learned to dance Today, she passes her knowledge to a new generation She reflects on teaching With recording singers and movie actors can leave their way of singing and playing music but with dancing it's a little more difficult If you don't do it through teaching you can't leave a school of dance This is why I like teaching very much La Tati is highly sought as a teacher But as an artist she gets her deepest satisfaction from performance My life is shaped on the stage All that I feel or live for, everything all my suffering and all my glory all my life is on the stage She rehearses for a tour that will take her to France The quality of flamenco is to get out of a difficult situation of crying and of sorrow to get into an explosion of happiness and a feeling born in the soul and the heart Flamenco is an expression of the soul The guitar is the instrument of Spain In the working-class neighborhood where he grew up Arcangel Ferbabdez has hand-crafted guitars for 36 years I had my first job at 11 as a furniture maker Later I became fond of playing the guitar I started to play flamenco Then I met a great maestro of guitar making one of the best in the world Since I had found that the artistic environment was not much to my liking I found myself turning to guitar making Only fine imported woods are used to create the body of the guitar They are carefully heated and shaped as the craftsman gradually brings the instrument to life To make a good handcrafted guitar you need at least one month The difference between handcrafted and infactory guitars are many starting with materials The materials we use are quite expensive You must have knowledge of the trade and put live into your work For me that is the secret for making a good guitar Nothing else Signed and numbered by the craftsman a finished instrument may cost from two to ten thousand dollars Through this artist's expression the guitar gives voice to the Spanish soul During the decades of Franco's dictatorship the Catholic Church was able to legally enforce its rigid doctrines Even between engaged couples premarital contact was forbidden by the strictures of traditional courtship Among the middle and upper classes a single woman could not go out without a female chaperone to watch over her Today young woman go out alone and party at bars until 4 a. m Agatha Ruiz de la Prada is among the contemporary Spanish women who now define their own roles in society Agatha lives in a quiet Madrid suburb with her son Tristan, and the boy's father Her seemingly bourgeois home life is not quite what it appears My mother and father separate when I have more or less 12 And my mother goes to live to Barcelona So for me it was very nice because I have two cities and two houses and I have always the liberty of choosing one or the other I have never believed in marriage Liberty is very important for me and marriage is something that I don't like Ruiz de la Prada is a designer and business woman These dolls, whose costumes she creates, sold over a million in Spain alone last year She also designs highly original clothing When I was little I wanted to be a painter One thing that I have ever hate is the big distance between a picture on a wall and the way that people live I think that you when you like some picture you must wear it. No? And you must eat with it and you must sleep with it You must put it in your life No? Humorous and deliberately outrageous her design has brought her international recognition The impulse behind them in fact, springs from a traditionally Spanish attitude that of the rugged individualist Barcelona Spanish's largest seaport the nation's second city and industrial powerhouse Barcelona is also the center of a rich and highly original artistic tradition This legacy is evident everywhere... in a mosaic pavement created by the great Joan Miro... A design created by Picasso in his self-imposed exile during the Franco years... and the undulating curves of a facade by Antonio Gaudi A genius who used the sinuous forms of nature as the vocabulary for his architecture Gaudi was dubbed visionary-and madman Son of a coppersmith he was modest and self-effacing refused by the one woman to whom he proposed he would dedicate his life exclusively to architecture and God He maintained God continues creation through man In 1884 he began work in the Sagrada Familia the Expiatory Temple of the Holy Family It would be his masterpiece But in 1926 returning from evening church services to sleep in his workshop Gaudi was struck by a streetcar Three days later he died Thousands followed the funeral cortege to his final resting place the crypt of his unfurnished basilica Today, Gaudi's vision continues to take shape above him From the beginning construction has been funded by public donations Only some 50 artists and craftsmen are employed Architect Jordi Bonet like his father a specialist in the works of Gaudi has been entrusted with completion of the building As much a sculptor as an architect Gaudi preferred to make models rather than work from drawings Using them Bonet is able to continue according to Gaudi's concept A model of the nave the central part of the church reveals columns whose design was inspired by shapes found in nature They will support the ceiling of the nave filling the shell that has stood empty for over a century With all of these Gaudi original elements it is possible to continue it and to build in his place the nave But it is not so easy to continue it but I hope to have or to honor in the same spirit of Gaudi And for them we are working with all our forces to make the best Gaudi said the nave of this temple is a forest with the columns as the trees And then the light comes through this forest of columns little columns big columns It's a forest Gaudi's dream was that this church would be a beacon of the Christian faith Every year hundreds of thousands from throughout the world visit his unfinished poem in stone a structure one architectural historian has called the greatest ecclesiastical monument of the last one hundred years Holy week. Across the nation cities and villages ready for a ritual of faith that occurs in few places outside Spain and nowhere with more passion that in Seville Manolo Acosta dresses in the garb of an ancient religious brotherhood For me, Holy Friday is one of the fundamental things of my life... so important that I am thinking about that day the whole year With his brotherhood he will accompany sacred figures form their neighborhood church to Seville's cathedral and back Thousands gather in anticipation of the moment when a priceless, handcarved image of the Virgin emerges from the cathedral Platforms called pasos support lavish figures of the sorrowing Virgin Mother Christ, and scenes of his passion From Palm Sunday until Easter processions retrace the Stations of the Cross Proceeding blindly under the directions of a guide which may weigh up to two tons Marching with their brotherhoods thousands of penitents atone for sins committed through the year They wear masks and hoods designed centuries ago to conceal the sinners from all but God As the people of Spain approach the 21st century they seek to define their new identity strengthened by the timeless elements of Spanish life the ardor for spectacle and beauty the rich history, proud land and enduring traditions that are the soul of Spain
