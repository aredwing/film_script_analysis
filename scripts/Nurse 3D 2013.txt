This is their jungle, their breeding ground. And tonight, I'm on the hunt. These are the cheaters. The married, lying... ...scum. They are like diseased... ...cells, cultured... ...in alcoholic petri dishes. That destroy unsuspecting families... ...and infect millions... ...of innocent vaginae. There is no cure for the married... ...cock... ...only me... ...the nurse. Your money is no good... ...here. Two, please. Hmm. "Till death do us part. " What would your wife think? I always... ...give them one last chance. So, uh, heh, you got a name? I mean, what should I call you? Call me whatever the fuck you want. Hey, come on, give me that back. Beautiful family. - You're a very lucky man. - Okay. Okay, give me the wallet back. Fred W. Ward II... ...from Ridgewood, New Jersey. Boring. - I get it, really. - No. I don't think you do... ...Fred. You see... ...I'm all about a man with a ring. So, Fred... ...from Ridgewood, New Jersey... ...are you a no-good... ...cheating... ...son of a bitch? Yes. Yes. Absolutely. And your beautiful wife... ...how does she feel about your behavior? My wife? Heh. She's got no fucking clue. I'm afraid she will... ...now. Ow! Shit! Did you bite me? God, no. Just a small laceration to the femoral artery. Fuck. You crazy bitch. Don't be such a pussy, Fred. So here's the deal. At the rate you're bleeding... ...you'll be dead in a few minutes. And your wife... ...and those two beautiful girls... ...they won't be scarred by a cheating... ...sack of shit like yourself. Pay close attention now. You have a couple of choices. You could either head down those stairs. However, in approximately 90 seconds... ...you'll lose all consciousness. Or... ...you can take the fast way... ...down. From the time I was a young child... ...I was taught there is no higher calling... ...than helping those who cannot help themselves. I work at one of... ...the great institutions of healing: All Saints Hospital. The men here take the doctor-patient relationship... ...very seriously. When they say "open wide you might wanna make sure they are wearing pants. We each get a newbie to mentor here at All Saints. This is mine. Danni Rogers. She reminds me... ...a lot of myself when I first started. She has the looks, the insecurities... ...and emotional credentials to really make a difference. This is our story. And for you nurses... ...out there, lighten up. You do your job your way... ...and I'll do my job... ...mine. I love... ...my fucking job. Ladies and gentlemen... ...I am Dr. Robert Morris... ...the chief of staff at All Saints. And on behalf of the administration... ...I want to welcome you... ...and let you know that we consider... ...our nursing staff to be the backbone... ...of this hospital. You are our angels of mercy. Now I would like to introduce to you... ...the real person in charge here. The head nurse, Betty Watson. Welcome... ...to All Saints Memorial. This is a momentous day... ...for each and every one of you. For today... ...you join the elite fraternity of healers... ...known as the nurses corps. Now get over here, let me make it official. Mom! We are so proud of you. Congratulations. Thank you, Morn. I was so nervous up there. I'm so glad that's over. Hi. Abby! Ha, ha. We are so... ...lucky to have you. Abby, this is my mom. - Abby's been such an inspiration... - Hi. - ... to me. - You have such a special daughter here. - Thank you. - Champagne? For the lady of the hour. Congratulations, baby. - I'm so proud of you. - Thank you. - Abby, this is my boyfriend, Steve. - Hi. Abby Russell. And you must be the esteemed... ...Dr. Larry Cook. Yes. Well, enjoy the moment. See you in the halls. To Danni. This is Danni's boyfriend, Steve. I guess he wasn't smart enough to go to medical school... ...so he did the next best thing. He gets to wear a uniform and drive a big truck. Hello? Is someone in here? You scared the hell out of me. You're crazy. I can't believe we're doing this. Why don't you move in with me? We could do this... - ... whenever we want. - Move in? Yeah. - What? - Heh. That's a big commitment and... What does that mean? I mean... I have a new job. My mom's husband is an asshole. I have all this shit going on right now. Baby, what am I missing, what shit? Are you kidding me? Do you not listen to me when we talk? Where are...? Ooh. Whoa. - Someone is in here having sex... - Shit. ...with a very gorgeous biracial man. So I'm... ...just gonna be on my way. But consider this your break. You're back in five. You... ...take as much time as you need... ...because my break is up next. Ow. - I knew she was nasty, I knew it. - Hey. Danni, Danni, listen to me. Hey. Look, I love you. Okay, just tell me what it is that I'm not getting. Just forget it. The car was toast. High-velocity impact, driver's side. Here's the driver. Hey! You're not a fucking spectator. Get in the game. This was the first time Danni had ever seen anything... ...like this. She lost her... ...virginity and the blood flowed. She needed to see some carnage. It's part of being a nurse. This job is more than sticking thermometers in butts... ...and looking pretty. It's our job to take care of the problems, not make the problems. If you can't do this, work in a doctor's office, okay? You think about it. Don't be here if you can't do the job! That doctor, pig-face Morris. He loves breaking in the new girls. You could see the bulge in his pants. I wanted to comfort Danni, to hold her. To tell her that everything would be all right. - It was just... - Danni ran to her boyfriend instead. No, I can handle it. Steve, I called you for support, not to get a lecture. I gotta go, I'll call you back. Steve, now is not the time. Good bye. Are you okay? I don't know what happened. They were everywhere. I just froze. It happens to all of us. The first big one's always tough. But, hey... ...nobody died tonight. - Does it get any easier? - No. But after a while, you start to realize... ...that whatever... ...you're going through, it's a hundred... ...times worse for that person on the gurney. I graduated first in my class. I never got lower than a 97 on any exam. I know what I'm doing. Dr. Morris, shit, he was so pissed. He's always pissed, it wasn't just you. Come on. We'll grab drinks after I shower. What's wrong? That's Larry's car. That fucking scumbag. I knew he was cheating on my morn. Wait here. See you again, Dr. Cook. Thank you, thanks a lot. Larry? I thought you were at a conference in Boston. Uh, yeah. Yeah, Danni. It finished up early. So you called my morn... ...your wife, and told her you were gonna stop by... - ... the Fairmont! - Hey! Get your hands off! - You're out of line. - Son of a bitch. Here you go. I can't. I can't have another shot, Abby. It's so easy. Here, baby. Yes. That's it. Come on, let's go dance. Abby! I wasn't sure you were gonna wake up. Ugh. Where am I? My apartment. Jesus, really? Oh, God. The last thing I remember... ...was downing a drink at that club. How much did I drink? Where did...? Where'd I get this? I don't think I wanna know. Are you looking for these? Yeah. Um... God, I don't even remember... ...leaving the club last night. Shit, did I ever... ...call Steve back? Don't worry, I texted him... ...from your phone. As you. I wasn't sure... ...if he knew about your drinking. How do you like your coffee? You seem like a milk... ...and sugar kind of girl. Here. Call in sick. Spend the day with me, we'll have so much fun. Abby, it's my first week, I can't. It's a hospital, people get sick all the time. Sound sick. Abby, Abby, I feel like shit, but I'm not sick. Look, I have to go. Have you seen my clothes anywhere? I can't wear this to work. Danni was getting all weird. Not a thank you. She was so worried Steve might find out... ...that Danni got fucked by a total stranger. And she's trying so hard... ...to remember if she did it or not. And if that's not enough... ...she's wondering if I was a part of the fun. Here, you can have this. - I was gonna give it away anyways. - My God... ...thank you so much. Either way, she'll tell herself... ...the whole thing was a dream. But I won't let her get away with that. No, this was no dream. Could we just pretend last night never happened? How about... ...next time we just do, like, lunch... ...and shopping or something? She got fucked... ...and she liked it. She can't turn her back on that. I won't let her. Neighbor! Hey, neighbor. Hey, haven't seen you around much. My schedule's been murder. What happened to your hand? Carpal tunnel. Well, I hope it's from having fun. No. I mean, not what you're thinking. I worry about you going out alone. There's a lot of creeps out there, and you look kind of... - ... you know... - Slutty? No, never. But guys might get the wrong idea. It's dangerous out there. I see dead people all the time. You transport cadavers to the Anatomy lab. You work with dead people, Jared. Yeah, but they weren't always dead. Some of them... ...were killed. Just saying, I've seen some nasty shit. And if you need protection, I'd be happy to accompany you. You're such a gentleman. I'll be fine. You have a good night, Jared. You too. 75 Rockefeller. I knew Danni's prick stepfather was a psychiatrist. I also knew he was a fucking scumbag. But I'm a hands-on kind of girl... ...and since I'm here, it can't hurt to deal... ...with some of my own shit. We've covered a lot of ground for our first session. What is it that gives you so much anxiety? I feel there's something you're not telling me. I'm an addict. That's more common than you think in the health-care... ...profession. What is it that you're addicted to? Men. There's nothing wrong with desiring men at your age. No, doctor, I'm not desiring men. I'm addicted to them. My mommy and I... ...loved going to visit Daddy at his office. I want you to put on your best smile for Daddy. Okay, go on in. Daddy worked... ...very hard. He was very dedicated... ...to his practice. He was a great influence on me. Even now, the way I live my life, the men I choose... ...is a tribute to that man. Sounds like you had a perfect family. Dr. Cook... ...do you think you could help me? Curing addiction doesn't happen overnight, it's a process. There are sex addiction programs... ...and treatment centers that I can recommend... ...and we'll continue to work on it here in our sessions. That's all the time we have. Same time next week? And if you, uh, need me sooner... ...here's my cell. Dr. Cook... ...I feel pretty confident... ...with you at my side... ...I can lick this. - Hi, Tony. - Happy to assist you. As I was saying... Good morning. Morning, doctor. I'm fine, thanks. I hope I don't look that tired. - I couldn't get to sleep. Morning, Regina. - Oh. I guess the paramedic likes your storage closet... ...because somebody got flowers... ...and it wasn't me. I can't remember the last time I got some damn flowers. I don't know why I can't get my husband to send me something. I give him good sex too. I got a great rack. No offense. You are lucky I was on call. Gunshot victim, internal bleeding. We drained him, sewed up the pulmonary lining. To prevent the sack from reopening... ...keep him immobilized. I want him on vecuronium. Start him on 6 cc's. If he so much as twitches, let me know... - ... immediately, we'll up his dosage. - Understood. Hmm. - Six cc's. - Sorry. The vercu? Hey, Michelle. I need 6 cc's... - ... of vecuronium. - Okay. I'll get it for you. Bumpy start for us, Rogers. But I've got a feeling... ...you'll fit in perfectly. Keep it up. Thanks, Mel. Thanks, Danni. As I watched Danni's little round ass... ...the same one that I had eaten the night before... prior to finger-fucking her to six orgasms. And when I saw those tacky $10 flowers... ...from dickless little Steve... ...I couldn't control myself. Fuck him, fuck her. I'm not some fuck-toy to be played with and tossed aside. She needs me... ...whether she knows it or not. I'm so clumsy. It's okay. Just be careful. I'll replace the vase. It's fine, here. I'm sorry, the flowers are beautiful. Did he fuck up? We just had a disagreement. Do you wanna talk about it, just us girls? Steve's now pressuring me to move in. Don't ever... - ... let a man pressure you. - He's a really... ...good guy. They all start that way. How well... ...do you know Steve? We met back when we were freshmen... ...in college. We started dating a couple years ago. He was really there for me when my father passed away. What happened to him? Car accident. Drunk driver. I'm so sorry. I know how you feel. I lost my father... ...when I was 8 years old. Hold out your hand. This is an extra key to my apartment. - Why? What for? - If you ever... ...need your own space... ...or you just wanna get away from Larry... ...or Steve... ...it's there for you. Thank you. You know, funny enough, Larry is the reason I go home. I don't wanna leave him alone with my mother. Steve just... ...doesn't understand that. I understand. You wanna protect your mother. Every daughter does. - Hi, Larry. - Hi. I can call you Larry? Is that okay? - I mean, office hours are over. - Of course, of course. Is there something wrong? - Can you give me a ride? - Sure. Do you want me to call somebody about your car? No. No, my car is fine. It's, um... ...my addiction. It's happening again. We should go somewhere and discuss this. Yes. Yes, please. Your house? Um, no. No. - We can't go there. - Oh, right. Wifey. And so the dedicated husband... ...esteemed author, learned educator... ...and renowned therapist... ...took me to an alley to fuck. I wonder if he's going to bill me for the session. So... ...you're officially... ...my favorite client. I'd say we're having a breakthrough. There's a hotel around the corner. What's wrong with right here? Your wife ever... ...tie you up, Larry? No. What the fuck? Larry... ...I've just injected you... ...with 4 cc's of vecuronium. So relax. Wow, that was fast. It's already paralyzed your arms. And soon... ...it will make it impossible to move... ...any other part of your body. And while vecuronium is slightly more... ...expensive than its competition... ...it produces few adverse side effects. It simply paralyzes you. You look so adorable strapped in like that. Here, allow me. So let's make this a happy event. Once you're gone... ...your wife will inherit... ...lots and lots of money. She will never know what a creep you were. You won't get caught. So you see, Larry... ...this is a win-win. And as I watched... ...the monster about to die, I knew I'd done... ...the right thing. This would set things right for me and Danni. It was a perfect... ...jumping-off point. The very thing... ...for me and Danni to build on. I felt a new beginning. There was actually moisture... ...trickling down my leg. Larry made me come after all. Holy shit. Lady, you got a cell? Call 911. Directory assistance. City and listing, please. In Manhattan, the number of Maestro's. Thank you, we'll connect you. Hello, Maestro's. Can you tell me the specials of the evening? We've got a very nice seafood risotto and a lobster bisque. Sounds so good. And, uh, we've got some portobello-stuffed ravioli... ...in a bchamel sauce with sauted shiitake mushrooms. Shiitake mushrooms? Wow. Yeah, can you...? It's just me, Jared. Oh. It's kind of late to be getting in. Go back to bed, Jared. You're the best man I know. I returned home on a high. An orgasm and a great meal at Maestro's. Jesus. Danni? Are you all right? Larry was killed tonight. It's okay. It's okay. I'll take care of you now. My mother is sedated. My aunt said she'd call me if she needs me. I just had to get out of there. I'm a mess. I'm sorry, I just... I had nowhere else to go. You came to the right place. You'll stay with me. Thanks. But I was just on my way to Steve's. I just... I really needed to talk. I think I'm gonna move in with him. Danni, you've been traumatized. Now is not the right time to make... ...that kind of a decision. He cares about me. I think he really... ...wants to understand me. I understand you. Nobody understands you... ...like I understand you. Nobody. Now, forget about this Steve. He's just some... ...loser you fucked in college. You're a nurse now. Grow up already. Why are you being like this? Being like what? I have to leave. So that was it. Nobody will ever understand you like I do. And you were right, Larry was a pig. I just hope his dick got sliced off when he went through the windshield. I never told you he was in a car crash. Miss Rogers. Detective Ed Rogan. I'm really sorry for your loss. I'm working on your stepfather's case. Postmortem and tox came in. I might have some questions... - ... so I wanted to introduce myself. - Probably isn't the best time. Probably. I need to speak with anybody who saw your stepfather... ...the day he was killed. Gotta roll with the punches here. Well, if there's anything you think I might need to know... ...I'd appreciate you calling me. I can't think of anything I need to tell you about him. Well, again... ...I'm really sorry for your loss. Just give me a second. Why were you speaking with that cop? I was a patient of Larry's. He meant a lot to me. I never mentioned it to you. Please... ...give your mother my best. And as simple as that, I left her. I had to get back to work, and this mentoring thing... ...was becoming a distraction. I wasn't myself... ...but I would have never guessed what was coming at me next. Good morning. Isn't it a lovely day to smile? Ooh. Good morning. Have a wonderful day, okay? Good morning. Oh, darn. Good morning. How are we today? We are peeing in a bag. Oh, how convenient. Ugh. Will you look at this? - What? - This damn lady... ...with these smiley-face stickers. There are no smiley-face people here. You think this man pushing his bladder... - ... feels like smiling? - Heh. Probably not. Think me having to change that bag... ...is making me wanna smile? - Definitely not. - No. Hell, no. I hate these smiley-face people. She better not bring her ass here. I will punch that bitch right in her face. See who's smiling then. Oh, shit. Here she comes. Look down. I mean, don't look up. Act like you're doing something. Don't look up. Don't look up. Shit. Good morning... ...Regina. How'd you know my name? Well, I know everything. I'm the new HR director. Ha, ha. Plus, you're wearing a name tag. Right there. - Ha, ha. I can see it. - So you can fire my ass? Oh, it's only my first day. Give me some time. That's not funny. We got a lot of work to do here. We don't got time to be happy. So how can I help you, Miss Adams? Thank you for asking. I'm looking for Abigail Russell. She's doing her rounds. - Four thirty-one. - Thank you. Oh, no, I'm... - Have a wonderful day. - What's...? See, no, honey, I'm not really the smiley-face type. Do you have a angry face? Hello. Have a good day. Abby? Hi. Rachel Adams, I just started up in Human Resources. - Welcome aboard. - Oh, thank you. Whoop! You know, you look really familiar. - Where'd you grow up? - Right here in New York. - You? - A few miles away. Paramus. Can't say I've ever been. Gosh darn it, you look familiar. Where'd you go to college? Syracuse. How about you? Rutgers. Oh, well, we'll figure it out. Well, it looks like you're very busy. Yay. So, uh, when you get a moment, I'd like to go over the schedules... ...make sure we're staffed properly. - Okay - Okay? I'll drop by to see you. Thank you. Ha, ha. Oh! Oh. I realized who you look like. - Anybody good? - Well, no one you'd know. My next door neighbor, Sarah. They put her in Sunnyview Institute when she was just a kid. The last time I saw her, she was putting her mother's house up for sale. - But that was a few years ago. - Well... ...if I run into someone who looks like me... ...I'll make sure to send your regards. Hey, you got any more of those smiley-face... ...stickers? I'll bet they'd really... ...cheer up some of my patients. Of course. Aw. Thank you. You are the spitting image of Sarah Price. Just so you know. Wowie. "University of Syracuse. " Hmm. Whoa! Oh, my God. You scared me. - Is everything all right? - It's been quite a first day. That was interesting. Oh, I'm so sorry. It sounds like you could use a drink. - You wanna meet up later tonight? - Sure. - The Setting? - It's a date. - Girls' night. - Mm-hm. - Hello? - Hey. Do you want something? I thought you might like to join me and the new HR girl. - We 're gonna go grab a drink. - I'm busy. I feel like you've been avoiding me. Where are you now? I'm at Steve's. We're having dinner at his house. Really? You need some help with that big bag? I was truly confused by Danni's behavior. Larry was her stepfather. She hated the guy. He's gone and she's mad at me. I failed as a mentor. She failed as a friend. Game on. Hey, babe. Didn't hear you come in. Hi, babe. Hey. Hey. - Um, can you, uh, get me my water bottle? - Yeah, sure. Thank you. What are you doing here still? Trying to get out the door. I'm running late. - You looking at porn? - No. I'm clearing spam. You have to get a better firewall. You good? What's up with you? I just need you to hold me. Sure, baby. But I can't guarantee... ...that it won't turn into something else. You okay? What's going on? It's Abby. She... I found out she was a fucking patient of Larry's. Okay. And? Well, we are... We were getting close and she... She never... - ... told me that. - Since when did you guys become close? We're... We're not. She thinks we are. And she should have told me about that. I mean... ...she knew how I felt about Larry. Danni, is there something else going on between you guys? Like what? Like you're having other issues and reading into things? Who's that? It's the captain. He's pissed. I know this is something you need to talk about, and I wanna hear it. No, just go. Go to work. I do wanna talk about whatever is bothering you. - It can wait, okay? - Okay. I'll see you later. Is that Danni? - Hi, Danni. - Hi, Rachel. It's Danni, say hi. - Hi, Danni. - Hey. Hi. I'm with Tara. I'm not with Sarah... ...I'm with Abby. Are you going...? Because she looks like... But she's not Sarah. She's Abby. Abby, say hi. Say hi, Abby. Hey. Heh. Cheers, okay? So many cheers to you. And to everybody... - ... in the world. - Heh. - Are you okay? - Danni? Um... Rachel. Rachel, look behind you. Behind you. - Rachel! - You go, girl. Behind you. No, no. Behind you! Ra... Look. No, no, no. No, look... Look behind you. Look behind you. No, look, Rachel, look. 911, what's your emergency? Hi. Uh, I think I just saw someone being killed. It was online. They Skyped me. Um... Abby Russell. She... She lives off of Queens Boulevard... ...in Long Island City. It's 150117th Street. Abby Russell? And she's the victim? No, she's the killer, and it's happening right now. You have to send somebody now. Miss, we're dispatching a unit right now. Rachel's been looking for a reason to cause trouble. Sticking her smiley... ...little face into places it shouldn't be. That's not the kind of things friends do to each other. Is it, Danni? Poor Rachel. It looks like someone... ...won't be at work tomorrow. Oh, my God. All right, Miss Rogers. I think I got it. If you'll wait here, Rogan... ...will be with you when he finishes his interview. He'll have some questions. If you'll excuse me... Danni called the cops on me. Pathetic. So I told the big black stud cop that Danni was a damaged little girl... ...and how much it pained me to see her this way. I'm not sure, but I might have even squeezed out a tear. You are lucky... ...your friend's not pressing charges. You can't just call 911 and accuse someone of murder. Hey. Hey, what's going on? Are you okay? I saw her... - ... raising the needle to Rachel's neck. - Rachel Owens is fine. She drank too much. She was passed out on Abby's couch. Abby's taunting me. She's doing this... - ... to fuck with me. - Abby Russell seems to think... ...you're obsessed with her. Said you broke into her apartment the night... ...your stepfather died, that you must have made a copy of her key. She gave me a copy of her key. Why would she give you a key? She suggests you wanted to be more than just friends. - It isn't like that. - Not like that? What is it like, huh? Is it like this? Or is it like... ...whew, that? Huh? Hmm, here's another one. You guys just... This is my favorite one. She says... ...you're obsessed with her. She drugged me. I ran a blood test. - I had rufilin in my system. - Can you prove it? Word of advice? Stay away from Abby Russell. She killed my stepfather. She told me to my face she killed him. Yeah, I read your report. Here. This word, can you pronounce it for me? Vecuronium. Vecuronium. What is that? It's a paralytic drug. Well, the autopsy report shows... ...your stepfather had it in his system. Why would Larry... ...inject himself with a paralytic drug? He wouldn't. It paralyzes you. Well, someone did. My boys down in the lab, they're never wrong. And something else is biting at me. The same day your stepfather died, you signed out... ...the same drug. Heh. How crazy is that, huh? Any reason I shouldn't be digging up your stepfather? You can go. I can only imagine what you're thinking. No, you can't. - Please. I'm telling the truth. - Oh, you're telling me the truth. You're telling me somebody Photoshopped... ...those pictures up there? Huh? And somebody else forged your signature? - Steve, it's... - Do you think I'm stupid, Danni? - I know it looks bad. It's not like that. - Jesus. And you've been... ...fucking around on me with Abby. I haven't. You know me, I wouldn't do that. Steve. She's a liar, Steve. She's a fucking liar. She made all of it up, okay? - I can't hear you. - She made it all up. You know me. I won't be home tonight. Steve. Don't do this. It's just... You're the nurse from All Saints that called about Sarah Price? - I am. - Man. I haven't thought about Sarah since she left here when she was 18. Why was she here? Poor kid, you know. She was only 8... ...when her mom... ...walked in on her dad at the office. He was playing hide the snake... - ... with his nurse. - Robert. How...? How could you? Just wait outside. Mommy and Daddy need to talk. Go on outside, Abby. I told you... ...never to barge into my office. Never again. You understand? When the father's nurse testified... ...in support of Sarah's mom, the state... ...sent the little girl here. What happened to Sarah? Sarah was a very complicated kid. Kind of stuck to herself most of the time. Cutest thing though. She used to always... ...walk around with this doll. It was a nurse's doll. What happened to her? Oh, about a year later, the mom committed suicide. Sarah had... ...no other family. One of the nurses here, she became like her, uh, guardian angel. Janet Russell. She and Sarah were inseparable. Sarah used to follow her around the institution. They developed quite... ...the mother-daughter bond. When Sarah was released... ...she went and lived with Janet. When Janet retired... ...she just stopped coming around. It's like she just... ...disappeared. I'm not sure whatever happened to Sarah. Dr. Morris... ...I got your message. What's the issue you wanna discuss? One of our young nurses had some troubling things... ...to say about you, Abby. Well, you know, I can be a little tough on the new girls. Yeah, this sounded a bit more than tough. I'm considering my options. Either I can look into... ...this complaint by the nurse, maybe bring the matter up before the board... - Or? - Or... ...I provide you with an opportunity... ...to show yourself in a different light. Let's go someplace private where we can talk. What the fuck? Let me get some toys. Life is all about... ...choices, Dr. Morris. You chose to have... ...a wife... ...and a family. And I'm guessing... ...that your kids... ...will be quite messed up. Now, that is... ...so unfair. These are just children... ...doctor. Pure, innocent souls. So... ...here are your choices. We can gouge... ...your cheating... ...eyes out. Or... ...do we cut... ...out your heart? That is assuming you have one. Stay with me, John. No. No. Let's get rid... ...of Mr... - ... Weenie. - No! So he can't cheat... ...on Mrs. Whiney anymore. And by the way, Mr. Weenie... ...is looking very teeny... ...right now. Should we go for it? - No! No! - Yeah? No. Fucking insane. Shh. No. No. I say we start with your arms. No, no, no! No! No! No! Nurse's station. This is Regina. Regina, it's Danni Rogers. I need to talk to Rachel from Human Resources. I don't have her cell. Can you look it up? Because I don't have nothing else to do. I'm not an operator. Come on, Regina. It's important. I... Look it up in the employee directory. The operator won't give it out. Anything else? Oh, heh, and by the way... ...I saw your cute little boyfriend roaming the halls. I will let him get a little taste of this... ...until your skinny ass gets back here. Ha!

I was going to ask you the same thing. Her blood is in your car. So is her phone. Where is she? She didn't show up at work today. I think something's going around. I sure hope Steve doesn't catch it tonight. It's Steve. You know what to do. I know you don't believe me, but stay away from Abby. She's dangerous. You have to trust me. Abby? Hey, Abby.

Who the fuck are you, huh? Should I call you Sarah? I don't care who the hell you are. You're under arrest... ...in connection to the death of Larry Cook. I thought we had a connection... ...you and I. Shit. We fucked. End of story. I don't know who you are... ...but you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say... ...can be used against you in the court of law. Look... ...if it's money you want... ...you can have everything... - ... I've got. - Shut up. Anything you say... Please don't shoot me. Leave me alone. - You crazy bitch. - Please! Oh, my God. - I warned you it's dangerous out alone. - Jared... ...you had no choice. You did what you had... - ... to do. - We should call the police. No. Listen to me. He's dead. You were just... ...protecting me. - Fuck. He's a fucking cop! - Jared... ...we can handle this. We just need to make this... ...go away. The police are gonna... turn things around and make you look like the bad guy. And you know what they do to cop killers. Jared, you did the right thing. Thank you for being there for me. I can make this go away. Thank you, Jared. You saved my life. There are two sides to every story. Some would see this chapter of my life... ...as the work of a sick woman. The way I see it, everybody's better off. The wives... ...the kids and their bank accounts. A few less scumbags to spread unhappiness. My work here is done. Can I help you? Hey there. Good morning. I'm Rachel Owens. Oh, you're the new HR lady. Dr. Bailey's expecting you. Down the hall on the left. You are such a dear. Thank you. And you have a wonderful day. Okay?
