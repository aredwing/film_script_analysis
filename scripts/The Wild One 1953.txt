Maybe I could have stopped it early. But once the trouble was on its way, I was just going with it. Mostly I remember the girl. I can't explain it, sad chick like that. But something changed in me. She got to me. But that's later, anyway. This is where it begins for me. Right on this road. Come on, get off the track! What are you doing? Get over there! Come on, all of you! Now they're approaching the turn for the last lap. Let's see, Riley and some... Hillman taking a tumble. And Jones doing very well to avoid him too. This is the final lap coming up and still anybody's race. That's Conners in the hay. It's a bad break for Charlie Conners. And they'll go into the last lap. Last time around coming up. They're all hot today. It's anybody's race. They're in that order now, but anything can happen. maybe a record... Come on, Al! Come on! Come on! Thattaboy! Come on! Hey, get off the track! Get off the track. Please don't cross the track. Please don't cross the track. Don't get hurt. Blood makes everything slippery. What's the matter with you chowder heads? You in such a big hurry to die? Those words mean anything to you, squirrels? Are you looking for trouble? These outlaw outfits always want to foul things up for everybody else. Hey, what kind of outfits? Say that again. Outlaw outfits, like yours. Okay, square, right now. You want to drag Johnny here 100 yards for beers, or you chicken? - The square's chicken. - They're all chicken. You want to see something? You wanna see Johnny go? He can really go. He can really screw it on. What do you get when you win one of these scrambles? $5000? Boy, I'd sure like to win me $5000. Hey, you dummy, come here. If you win, they give you one of these beautiful gold statues. - Solid gold. - Pure solid gold. Dipped. - What do you do with it? - Take it home to your mother. Yeah, then you throw it away. Break it up, break it up. Put these trophies back. All of you, stand back. Hey, where can I get me one of these jazzy suits? I want to look like a street cleaner too. Hey, who are you? What are you doing here? You a cop or something? Come on. - Don't push anybody. - Okay, okay, break it up. We got enough entertainment around here. I've seen enough of you guys to last me forever. Now, hit the road. I mean right now. Get going. We want to watch the thrilling races, daddy. One more cute remark and you won't be riding any cycles. I'll put the bunch of you away for a month. Now, get going. Hey, fellas, come here. Look what Johnny won. Hey, what's the matter with you? Second place? So Johnny only won second place, huh? What do you mean? First place was two feet high. Hey, Johnny, look. These squares are having a dance in Carbonville tonight. We'll go, huh? - No, man. That's nowhere. - Come on. We can clobber it. Come on, Johnny. Let's go someplace. Let's get out of here. Every time you look around, there's cops. All right, let's get rolling. This way. - Where's that bunch from? - I don't know, everywhere. I don't even think they know where they're going. Termites. Nutty. Ten guys like that give people the idea everybody... ...that drives a motorcycle is crazy. What are they trying to prove? Beats me. Looking for somebody to push them around... ...so they can get sore and show how tough they are. They usually find it someplace, sooner or later. Hey, Johnny, where are we going? - Let's get gas. - Yeah, give us some gas! Hey, gas man. Ben, business before pleasure. Jimmy, better put some more beer on ice. What is this joint? What war do you suppose this joint was left over from? Hey, fellas, drag for beers. Who wants to drag for beers? Last guy in the door of that joint buys beers. Last guy in buys. - Hey, who is it? Who is it? - Art, you all right? It's Art Kleiner. Come on. - Hey, help this man out! - Hey, help this man out! Help the man out! Help the man out! Put me down! Put me down! Help the man out! Help the man out! - What is all this? - We're just dragging for beers. And this guy: - He doesn't know how to drive. - Yeah. There's a boy hurt here. It's his ankle. Looks pretty bad. What's all that, Kathy? What's all that? Somebody killed? Hey, Crazy, you can't sleep in the street. Man, look at this cycle. You really stacked up this thing. I'll call Dr. Ziegler. Get your pickup, we'll take him over. Harry, you seen how it happened. Those motorcycles were coming straight at me. I swung my wheel over as hard as I could, but they-- Take a look at that. - What about this, Harry? - It was an accident. I saw it. Mark got excited, that's all. - Aren't you gonna arrest anybody? - Take it easy, Art. Take it easy. I'm not excited. I'm just telling you what happened. I tried to miss him, then he hit me. My car's a wreck and somebody has to pay for the damages, and I mean it. Okay. You the big cop in the town? Next time, tell him to look where he's going. He don't know how to drive. I mean, he ought to turn one way or the other. You know what I mean? There was guys all over the street trying to miss him. - Now, just a minute-- - He's all right, but my boy's busted up. - Look here, Harry-- - Forget it, Art. Forget it. - Some cop, huh? - See Johnny back him down? Yeah. What a screwball town. Art Kleiner's too old to be driving an automobile. Where was he going, anyway? Always going someplace. Crazy, excited. Taking a lot of vitamin pills, drinking. Over-stimulated. Ought to arrest the whole lot of them. Call the militia. - Do you want something? - Yeah. I'd like a bottle of beer. - The beer's just in the bar. - Alrighty. Why, thank you. Look, Harry. The fender's scraping in the tyre. Wait a minute. There you are. It won't scrape no more. Good as the rest of them. Oh, no. Harry, aren't you gonna do something about this? - Well, what do you expect me--? - What do you want Harry to do? Arrest all these boys? All 30 or 40 of them and whatever there is? It's the principle. You let something like this go by and anything goes. - That's right. Make your complaint, Art. - I sure will. That's silly. Your car is okay, you're okay. And it's lucky, the way you drive. - Say, you live here all the time? - All my life. We've been over to Carbonville, at the meet. Bunch of motorcycles came through this way yesterday. They didn't stop. Is that what they give you in those races for killing yourself? That's right. You want it? - No. - Well, go on, take it. Go ahead. - No. - Go on. You can't do that. You won it. You have to get your name engraved on it, whatever you do. It's important. You don't give something like that away just like that. Not unless you knew a girl real well and you liked her. Hey, Johnny. About this town, they've got a doc here. They'll rewire Crazy. What are we gonna do? Sit around and scratch ourselves? Are we gonna wait for Crazy, or are we gonna get out of this dump? We're gonna wait for Crazy. Go. Go, go. Hey, you guys! Johnny says we're gonna hang around and wait for Crazy. They're gonna fix him up. - What do we do here? - Give me a swig of this, will you? Don't fight, boys. Plenty more where this came from. It's ice-cold too. - Hey, doc. - Yeah. Hey, where do we eat? Right there. Bleeker's Cafe. We'll take good care of you. - You got some steaks? - Kansas City steaks? Well, we serve good meat. - Where's the motel? - The hotel is right over there. Hey, they've got a hotel here. - Hey, come on, lead me to that brew. - Hey, check the hot rod. Hey, the fire went out! How are you doing, blondie? Hey, baby. Where you going? Well, look who's here. - What'll you have, girls? - Yeah, what will it be, girls? - The usual. - The usual. All right, just one minute. - And hit us with a couple of beers. - Jimmy, put a couple more cases on ice. Kathy said you wanted some glasses. That was an hour ago. Never mind. I'll do it myself. - Take over here, will you, Jimmy? - Come on, Jimmy! I'm dying of thirst. I'm dying of thirst. Please stop mumbling. Jimmy, what do you hicks do around here for kicks? What time is it? Hey, what do you do around here? Anything ever happen? - Oh, yes. - Like what? - Roses grow. - Oh, roses grow. - People get married. - Married. Crazy as any place else. Bugs get on them, cause trouble sometimes... - ...that is, if you don't spray good. - Yeah. - There's no bugs on you, Jim? - I mind my own business. That's the way to be, Jim. I listen to the radio. Music, that is. News is no good, excites people. - Hey, Jim, what about TV? You like TV? - What? New thing, Jim. Television. - Oh, pictures. - Yeah. No, no pictures. Everything these days is pictures. Pictures and a lot of noise. Nobody even knows how to talk, just grunt at each other. - Where you been? - Working. Listen, what's happening later? What are you gonna do later? I work. - You've got to goof off, don't you? - What? - You're not gonna work forever, are you? - It feels like it sometimes. I'm talking about tonight, after you finish up? I have to stay here as long as we're busy. It sounds like we'll be busy until you leave here. Where are you going when you leave here? Don't you know? Man, we're just gonna go. Just trying to make conversation. It means nothing to me. On the weekends we go out and have a ball. What do you do? I mean, do you just ride around... ...or do you go on some sort of a picnic? A picnic? Man, you are too square. I'll have to straighten you out. Listen, you don't go any one special place. That's cornball style. You just go. A bunch gets together after all week, it builds up. The idea is to have a ball. If you're gonna stay cool, you've got to wail. You've got to put something down. You got to make some jive. Know what I'm talking about? - Yeah, I know what you mean. - Well, that's all I'm saying. My father was going to take me on a fishing trip to Canada once. Yeah? - We didn't go. - Crazy. Solid. Hey, pops, give me one of those crazy beers, will you, man? - Man, that was real cool. - Thanks, daddy-o. That's fine old playing. We've got to get this beer. Thank you, pops. - Bop me, dad. - I bopped you, dad. Pops, thumb me. Come on. That's it. Thumb me. - Now, give me some skin. Ooze it out. - Ooze it out. - Just nice and-- Ooze it out. - Thattaboy, ooze it. - Now, elbow us. Just elbow us. - Pops, do you pick up on this jive? - What? - Pick up on this jive? This crazy music. - Did you dig the rebop? - What? - The rebop, dad. The rebop. - He's a square. Don't you get this? You take the brew on the side and the time, and you take this bottle... Drink and... Go, go, go. - How about a dance? Come on. - How about you? You want to struggle? - Let's try. - Thattagirl. You're a daring one. Hey, can I help you? Hey, these are keen! Johnny, get a load of this. - They're real bells. - Aren't they cute? Crazy. Somebody tell me what that means. "BRMC." What does it mean? - Black Rebels Motorcycle Club. - Isn't that cute? - Johnny, what are you rebelling against? - What have you got? Kathy, aren't they wonderful? Did you hear what I said? I said, "What does 'BRMC' mean?" He said, "Black Rebels Motorcycle Club." I asked, "What are you rebelling against, Johnny?" And he said, "What have you got?" "What have you got?" What's the matter? Don't you like to dance? Well, I don't dance very well. The squares are having a dance in Carbonville. You want to make it? Aren't you Miss--? Taken about that. - Oh, my. - Coffee, please. Two coffees, please. - You want to go? - I can't. - How come? - Well, I can't. Besides, it's silly. - You just came from Carbonville. - So what? We'll just go back over there. Hey. Hey, you gentlemen ordered some coffee. I think you ordered some coffee. The young lady's waiting for you. That's a good boy. What's with him? You won yourself something, did you? Well, that's a nice souvenir to have. Look, Johnny, out there I think you got me a little wrong. I've got a job to do, but I'm not hard to get along with. It's generally just a misunderstanding... ...but looks like anything that might develop into real trouble... It can be decided if folks just sit down and talk it over. Dad. Would you like me to fix you a steak sandwich or...? No. Why did you do that for? Why are you trying to be so rude? I don't like cops. Let's get out of here. Come on. - Did you get lined up with that chick? - No, man. Her old man is that itchy cop. - Let's get out of this town. - I'd like to get me a cop's daughter. Some deal, eh, Dinky? One beer, and a sidecar for my friend. He got his clutch overhauled. - Crazy, how's the foot? - I got it. Dig that cat, daddy-o. What are you doing tonight? Hey, the Rebels are here! Hey, the Rebels! Come on! It looks like Johnny's here. - Come on. Let's get out of here. - Johnny, this joint's wide open. - What's the matter? This is a bar. - Let's get out of here. No, it's a drag. Come on. Hi, sweetheart. What are you doing in this miserable gully, Johnny, my love? I love you, Johnny. I've been looking for you in every ditch... ...from Fresno to here, hoping you was dead. Chino's giving him the needle, and your boyfriend don't go for that. You've been having yourself a time, huh, Johnny? You do look pale. Have you been taking care of yourself? You been staying out too late at night? That's mine, Chino. Take it off. Don't do that. That's better, Johnny. I missed you. Ever since the club split up, I missed you. - We all missed you. Did you miss him? - Yeah. The Beetles missed you. All the Beetles missed you. Come on, Johnny, let's go inside, have a beer... ...and I'll beat the living Christmas out of you. Johnny, for old times' sake. Don't take that away from Chino. It's so beautiful. Chino needs it. It makes Chino feel like a big, strong man. Yeah, Chino wants to be a big racetrack hero. All these girls. I didn't win it. I just gleebed it. But I gleebed it off a guy that didn't win it either. Look, Johnny, you want one? How about you go gleeb one someplace for yourself, huh? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This is the main event. Ladies and gentlemen... This lovely young lady over here... ...shall hold this beautiful object signifying absolutely nothing. Watch closely. See how the timid maiden of the hill... ...clutches the gold to her breast. And see how she fights back a tear while her hero bleeds to death in the street. Come on, get up, you big hero. - What are they fighting about? - I don't know. Don't know themselves, probably. Stop this. I've seen hoodlums like this before. If you don't get tough with them the minute they get out of line, you're sunk. You are the cop. If you can't boot these jerks out, we'll have to bust a few heads. - That won't help matters. - Take it easy, Charlie. Nothing but talk. Talk. I'll see if everything is all right at home. Chino, come on, get up, boy. Don't let him make a fool out of you. Go get him, Chino. Come on, go get him! Go get him, Chino! Johnny, I love you. Johnny, how about you and me, we'll go and have a-- Shut up! Let's you and me have a beer, Johnny. Shut up, I said! - Get out of the way. I want out. - What's the big idea? Shut up! - You know how to drive? - Come on, I want out of here. - You're awful noisy, ain't you? - Now, look, you get away from me. - What did he do? - Tried to run Meatball over. Come on, up and over! Heave, ho! Heave, ho! Break it up. Break it up. Break it up. - Chief, he tried to run Meatball over. - Nobody ran anybody over. He ran his motorcycle in front of my car. Yeah? And then I suppose his cycle crawled... ...under your front wheel all by its lone self? - I want this man arrested. - He wants me arrested? You hear that? - He hit me. - Well, hit me back, you coward. Go on. All right, quiet! I'm gonna take you both down and lock you up. - Both of us? - Yes. So we can all talk without everybody yelling. Quiet! Whether I'll hold anybody or not depends on just how badly this boy here is hurt. See, I'm with the chief. - Are you hurt, man? - He don't feel a thing. - Harry. - What? - Let me talk to you. - All right, break it up. Move along. - Do you know what you're doing? - Of course I know what I'm doing. - Let's get these guys out of town. - Sure. We have to make a living here. If you arrest Charlie Thomas, he'll never forgive you. Well, okay. - Okay, come on. Come on. - What about him? Frogface, dear friend, we are being parted. Our love is being nipped in the bud. Wait a second. What did this boy do that frogface didn't do? Johnny, I want to talk to you a minute. I've given you a couple of chances. I don't know what you're after-- - Chief, let me tell you about Johnny. - Shut up. I'm in a spot here. You can do me a favour. You take your boys and go on, and the other bunch too. - Can I go too, chief? - Yeah, and he goes too. I made a deal with a cop once. Let me tell you about Johnny, daddy-o. He's okay, but you don't get on his back. He don't like nobody on his back. We had the same club once, and the Beetles got on his back all the time. He didn't like that. - Then you don't wanna do what I say? - Save me, Johnny. I'm going to the can. Yes or no? - I don't make no deal with no cop. - Okay. Come on. Hey, Johnny, write my mother a letter and tell her I'm in the can! Johnny, you gonna let that phoney cop get away with this. Hey, write my mother a letter... ...tell her to send me a case of beer. Oh, the shame of it all! Oh, the shame of it all! - Let's give this joint the needle. - What time is it? Where's that chick that's got my gold? She was standing right over there. Hi, Johnny. Thank you. Hey, Johnny. Don't you remember? Britches. You remember. The last weekend we went out scrambling. - Before the club split up. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. - How have you been? - I'm still swinging. I didn't know what happened to you. It's been a year I didn't see you. - I thought about you. - I'll see you later, okay? Where's my gold? I'm gonna blow this joint. Fine. Go someplace else and cause trouble. Listen, he put Chino in the can. Why didn't he put that frogface in the can? He was afraid of making a mistake. He's afraid of losing his job. He's the town joke and I'm stuck with him. He hasn't got any business being a cop. No more than you have with that. He's a fake, like you. Well, you've impressed everybody now, big motorcycle racer. Take that back so they can give it to somebody who really won it. Say what? Who are you, some girl who makes sandwiches or something? Your father wears a hat says he's a big, important man. You start telling me what to do? Nobody tells me what to do. You keep needling me, if I want to, I'm gonna take this joint apart. You're not gonna know what hits you. - Hey, beer. - Johnny, what's the pitch? We leaving? Not just yet. Hey, Johnny. - Johnny, come on, let's go spring Chino. - Yeah, one phoney cop. - Let's get him out of there. - Hey, we've got this town on the ropes. - Come on. - All right, let's go. Hello, Dorothy, get me the sheriff's office in Elsburgh. I'll see if I can get through for you, Harry. Hey, look what's in here. Hello, baby. - How does this work? - Can I get my mother on this? - This is Dorothy. Help! - Hello? - Hello, baby. - How does this work? Goodbye, Dorothy. Go on, take the day off, Dorothy. What is this? What are you doing here? Get off my lawn! Come on, get out of here! Listen, you hooligans, you've caused enough trouble. - Hey, Chino! - Hey, Chino! - Hey, Chino! - Get up, Chino. Come on, Chino! - Let's open it up. - Hey, you guys. Look, I've got the key! - Where'd you get the keys? - I see it. - I wore gloves. No fingerprints. - Good. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hey, Chino, wake up. In you go. Get in there. Hey, Chino. Chino, come on, get up. - There you go. - Come on, Chino. Leave him alone. Let him sleep it off. Hey, you want room service? We'll leave a call for you. Sleep well, Chino. Chino will be surprised when he wakes up. Johnny, what happened to that cop? Let's go give him a bad time. Yeah, I'll take the cop's daughter. - Okay, okay, I was smiling. - Maybe she's got a sister for me. Johnny, where are you going? Hello. Hello, hello. Hello. - What's the matter? Don't they answer? - Did you get them? The phone is dead. Better send somebody for the militia. That's silly. Let me try. Hello, operator. Operator. Dorothy. I guess you're right. Kathy, go see if you can find your dad. Tell him I need him right away. You better go home and stay there. Come on! Come on, Bleeker! Now, wait a minute! - Hi, Johnny. Where have you been? - What do you want? Talk to me, Johnny. Sing me a song. - Buy me a beer. - You've got a beer. I want to know how you've been, Johnny. I'm singing tonight, Johnny. I'm really singing. I'm on the Christmas tree. - You got a date? - Yeah, I got a date. Johnny. Remember the night--? The first time I went out scrambling with the Rebels. Remember? That was the first time I ever saw you. I haven't seen you since. We really got ourselves hung on the Christmas tree, didn't we? Boy, was I green. Was I really green. I thought I was really living it up. I had me a guy and we were really gonna go. But we had a lot of yaks anyway, didn't we, Johnny? Well, say it. Can't you say something? Please, Johnny. I won't get on your back. I wouldn't do that. But we had a lot of yaks anyway, didn't we? What do you want me to do, send you some flowers? Where's that girl? Where's that Kathy? The bar's closed, counter's closed, everything is closed. - Hey, Johnny, can't you stop this? - Where's that Kathy? I'm looking for her. - I don't know. If you can stop this-- - I don't stop nothing, man. - They're wrecking my place. - You're doing all right, man. Oh, no. Please. - You all right? - Let's get to work on these boys. - Anybody bring a gun for me? - Here. - Wait a minute. - Wait till somebody gets killed? I don't go all the way with Charlie either. But we've got to protect ourselves. But two wrongs never made anything right. - When you start using guns... - I'm gonna use it, one end or the other. Anybody who wants to stay and talk some more... ...can have an ice cream social with Bill. Anybody don't, can come with me. If you find him, bring him to the back of the store. We'll meet there. We'll do what we can. Let's get hold of this Johnny before the others do. Hey, Crazy, man, go, go, go! That Mildred gives the craziest permanents. - Marina, honey, let's dance. - I've been tapped. Hey, baby! Go, go, go! Come on, Leroy. Come on, Johnny, go! Hey, guys, look. New talent. Hey, fellas. - Well... - That's a good one. Let's get her! Please don't do this. Please don't. It's too expensive. Please. Mildred, honey, where you been? Let's dance, sweetie. - Hey! The chick! - Johnny's girl! Let's get her! Get on. Get up. I'm sorry, I can't fight back. I'm too tired. It would be better, wouldn't it? Then you could hit me. You think you're too good for me. Nobody is too good for me. Anybody who thinks they're too good for me... ...I make sure I knock them over sometime. I can slap you around to show you how good you are... ...and tomorrow I'm someplace else and I don't even know you or nothing. Do you want to? I wouldn't waste my time on a square like you. What I wanna knock myself out for? - I'll take you back and dump you. Come. - Johnny. Quit that. It's crazy, isn't it? You're afraid of me. I don't know why, but I'm not afraid of you now. You're afraid of me. I'm afraid of you? Are you cracked? Come on, get on. I wanted to touch you. I wanted to try, anyway. Try what? I don't know. I wanted to make it the way I always thought it would be sometime... ...with somebody. The way I always thought it might be. You're still fighting, aren't you? You're always fighting. Why do you hate everybody? I've never ridden on a motorcycle before. It's fast. It scared me. But I forgot everything. It felt good. Is that what you do? I'm gonna leave. That's what you want me to do, isn't it? You know what I used to think about? I used to think about it a lot after my mother died. That somebody would come here and stop at Uncle Frank's place... ...and buy a cup of coffee or something... ...and he'd like me right away and he'd take me with him. Johnny, you were going to give me that statue. Will you give it to me now? Why? I don't know. I just wondered if you still wanted to give it to me, that's all. It's crazy. Where did you want this guy to take you? This guy that had a cup of coffee. I don't know. Wherever he was going, I guess. I'm shaky. I wish I was going someplace. I wish you were going someplace. We could go together. Johnny, Johnny. Hey. Hey. Quit it. What's the matter, Kathy? I was only trying to-- - Chino, how did you get out of the can? - Johnny, I love you. Let's you and me have a beer, and I'll beat the living Christmas out of you. Come on, get everybody together. - We're gonna get out of here. - Storm the Bastille! There he comes! That's him! That's him. He's the one who... Dad, they've got Johnny. They're taking him... You've just been sitting here? Aren't you gonna do anything? There isn't anything to do, Kathy. We have to help him. They took him in a car, Mr. Thomas and some men. He wasn't doing anything. He was trying to stop it. He was going to leave. - How are things at Frank's? - Fight started. I don't know. I came to look for you. - Uncle Frank is very upset. - Well, he got what he wanted. - Business before pleasure. - Listen, they've gone crazy. Everybody. They've got Johnny. You've gotta help him. They're going to beat him up. I tried to talk to him. - Don't you even care? - What can I do? Nothing, I guess. But if you don't do something, you're worse than any of them. They brought it on themselves. I saw it coming, but what could I do? Charlie Thomas is a bully. He was a bully in the third grade. What am I supposed to do, shoot somebody? - Charlie, let me talk to the boy. - Bill, stay out of this. Get out of our way. - My old man used to hit harder than that. - Shut up. Hold on, there. Get away from that boy. Get back. This has got nothing to do with you. We've got a little job to do. - This is my job. - You won't have it long. We're doing something that should've been taken care of before this: Pounding a little respect for law and authority into this guy's thick skull. That's not the way to do it. You got a better way? You've had a lot of time to try it. Harry, look, you're too soft-hearted. This is no time for kindness. - It's as good a time as any. - We're doing this our way. We're gonna make good and sure he doesn't try anything like this soon again. I don't know what he's tried or hasn't tried. This boy's in my custody. If he's done anything to deserve punishment, he'll get it... ...but in the right way, not from you. Now, now, Harry. Take it easy. After all, we're all old friends. - Let's be calm and talk it over. Come on. - Yeah, let's talk this over, Harry. Hey! There he comes. That's him! What's all that? What's all the noise? What's going on? - Get him up. - We'll really fix him for this. - I'm gonna break your neck. - Finally killed a man, huh? Okay, come on. Leave him alone. What's the idea? Let's go. Harry, how did all this get started anyway? We had this man, we had this whole thing stopped when he stuck his nose it. - There's a little more to it than that. - All right. We'll find out what happened. Round up everybody on a motorcycle. Pick up all the witnesses you can find. The old man is dead. A dishwasher down the street. That makes it a manslaughter charge, doesn't it? We'll see. We'll see. Let's pick up everything and sort it out inside. Twenty years is too good for him. I spotted him for the ringleader the first five minutes. I knew somebody was gonna get killed. I couldn't get anybody to listen to me. You killed Jimmy with a lot of talk, as sure as he killed him with a motorcycle. Wait a minute. All right, okay, okay. That's enough. Now, stop it. That's all. Well, son, you've got yourself something here. Real important trouble. It just shows you what a boy can do if he'll work at it. Well? Haven't you anything to say? I didn't kill nobody. Those guys were after me and I just took off. That's all. Maybe something hit my cycle. I don't know what happened. Then I went out, and that's-- That's all. Yeah. Well... Let's go. I located my daughter. She went home. Do you want to talk to her? - No. Bring her in later. - You'd better talk to her now. You do? Well, I don't. I've been up half the night. I've got a long drive home before I can get this joker booked. - But she was with the boy. - He knows that. Art Kleiner is-- Shut up, Frank. All right. Come in, sit down. That'll be all. - Kathy's my niece. I have a right to stay. - All right, but keep quiet. - Well? - It's crazy. Yeah, I know. I've got one fact. A man's dead, and our boy here is stuck with it. - I don't think it was his fault. - Do you know one way or the other? No. You haven't fallen for this fellow, have you? No. No, I couldn't. Let's go. They beat him up. I saw them. He wasn't doing anything. I know he was leaving. - He just wanted to go when-- - Yes, I know. Sheriff, listen. - Sheriff, wait, please. - She's upset. She didn't mean that. But regardless of what happened to old Jimmy... ...that boy deserves everything he gets. - Art here saw her fighting him off. - No, Uncle Frank is wrong. He helped me. They were after me and-- She was crying, trying to get away from him. I wasn't trying to get away from him. I was just trying to get away. Maybe we better tell him, Frank. Tell me what? - Why, the-- - Art and I were coming up the street. Now, we didn't see who threw it... ...but a tyre iron either hit the boy or the motorcycle, and it went wild. - Who threw what? - A tyre iron. You know, it's a... The thing to take the tyre off the rim. Yeah. Somebody threw it and it landed at our feet. Why didn't you say so before? Sit down. John Strabler. You got any friends, Johnny? You picked up a few around here last night, strange as it seems. A couple anyway. They got you off the hook for a while. I don't get you. I don't get your act at all. And I don't think you do, either. I don't think you know what you're trying to do, or how to do it. I think you're stupid. Real stupid and real lucky. Last night you scraped by, just barely. But a man's dead on account of something you let get started... ...even though you didn't start it. I don't know if there is any good in you. I don't know if there's anything in you... ...but I'm gonna take a big, fat chance... ...and let you go. There'll be a hearing on this tyre-iron business. You'll get a summons. And you'd better show up. Put him on the road. - Is that yours? - Yeah. Go ahead. Don't you want to say anything to these people? What's the matter? You been hit over the head so often... ...you don't know when you're getting a break? At least say thank you. It's all right. He doesn't know how. Okay, hotshots, the fun is over. Every one of you monkeys is down in my book, and all the damage will be paid for. You've got 10 minutes to clear out. Just stick your nose back in this county, any of you... ...and you'll never see daylight again as long as you live. Now, get. Some coffee.
