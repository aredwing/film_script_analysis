I've played, not much. - I have the 9th fastest serve in the world. They clocked it. Verified. The doctor will meet you in Room 1. - Fabulous. Will be about an hour. Come on in now. - Ok. Thanks. Structurally, there are no abnormalities. This has to do with your musculature and your ligaments this has to be the last time we talk about this. What about ruptured discs? That is bullshit. All that shit is fucking fucking bullshit ok? Back disorders, duodenal ulcers, the most misdiagnosed conditions Attributed to middle-aged men today. I'm not going down that road. Stress, Al. Tension. Weariness, that's what causes most of this shit. Let me show you something. A little pressure. Look at that energy pattern. You look at it. I'll go along with it ... But I'm not fucking stressed. What are you reading? It's an article about a Tibetan who plays basketball with some other Monks in Arizona. Says they got in a fight with five advertising executives in front of a bunch of kids. What are you reading? Uhm ... mostly just ads. This one's for ... a .. Meditation cushion ... that's filled with buckwheat. And it costs $249 It's a cushion? Yeah, it's mostly just a pillow that looks like a stump. Seems like a lot. - Yeah. Do you have any interest in having sex with me? Yeah. - Really? Now. - Mm hmm. I need to schedule another appointment, Linda. How was your visit, Mr. Lolly? A waste of money. How about Thursday the 23rd? Nope. - The 24th? Yup. - 9:30? No. - 2:30 Yup. Smells like a wharf nut in here. What? You heard me. Smells like low tide. That's weird. - I don't smell anything. Hey, how was the doctor, dad? Yup, good enough quack. Charged a fortune but I've got his number. Did you know I had brain cancer once, Brian? No. - Yup. Yup, huge tumour on the recesses in my temporal lobe. But you're ok now. Yup. 100% holistic. No chemo, no radiation. What did you do? I mapped the pathology of the cancer with my mind. Very Chinese. Yup. Then I moved it. Again with meditation. I pushed it down to the fatty tissue of my temporal lobe Then I moved it down to my nasal cavity stream. Then ... then one day I just hocked it out. About the size of a squash ball, maybe bigger. Do you play squash, Brian? Yeah, I've played some squash. I was the No. 2 at Yale behind some Paki named Nasser. Dad. Uh. Pakistani. The guy was a wire. Hey Brian - Hi ... It's Missy. - Right, gerbil cock, right? She wants you. - Stop it. What's up in the rat world? Oh ... depression, sleep deprivation, test, the usual. What the fuck is that? This, is a sports drink. I'm hungover. How you doin' man? - - Ahh, well ... I got a problem. Yeah? What's going on? I had sex with this girl in the back of her father's station wagon the other day. Is it a sting when you pee kinda problem? No. Expound. Well ... now what? Mmm ... well now there are 2 possible reactions to this scenario. You either wanna bang it home again or you never wanna see her for the rest of your life. Which is it? Bang it home? Why are you saying it like it's a question? Bang it home. Yeah. There you go. Damn straight bang it home. Good job. Who is this girl? She came into the store the other day, and her dad bought a bed. God bless capitalism. So when's the next bang-bang gonna happen? I don't know. You like her? You like her like her? I don't know. You think it's possible that the rat that stopped swimming was just tired And taking a little break? Unlikely. These calculations are based on months of testing, so ... The same rat that stopped swimming again and again is probably more than just a little tired. How's the mattress business? I should get there. - Okay. Hey you ... should ask Missy out. Can't. Scared. Good luck. - Mmm ... you too. Hey, you gotta swim if you wanna bang it home. That's reality. Remember that. I will. What's our first meal? - Nothing. Ah, c'mon, I'm starving. Nah, it's better on an empty stomach. It's true. Crock. It's not. Yeah well I'm hungry I'm gonna grab somethin' to eat. Brian you want somethin'? No, I'm alright. Excuse me, shaman. Dad, you need some help? Nope, I've got it. When are the shrooms ready? Oh no no no ... best to let it steep a while. Talked to a local, he said there were alot uh ahead of the woods And black trumpets south side of Temper lower elevations than last year. You bringing that? Yup. Might be some pheasant. - A pheasant with a death wish? That's tradition. He brings a gun He doesn't use the gun. He throws up. Thanks dad. Sometimes ... it takes mushrooms to find mushrooms Prepare your pouches for the poisoning. Well, my hand is starting to look a bit like an eagle's claw. So I think it's time to pack our stuffs. Any news from China? Uhm, not really. Same stuff, I'm on the list ... A couple of years ... could be earlier. Yeah, well, listen, my friend Jin Ho Very powerful businessman, Right here in the States Owns an airline company, tobacco interests, some crap like that And uh, he might, he might be able to help you. Well, I think he's Korean, dad if that's what you mean. Yes, yes ... he's a marvelous Korean!! Of no help to you. Yeah, well ... I hope it happens. Be nice to have some new life in this family. Hope you get the kid, yea. I think you'd be great at it. You think so? - I do, I do .... You got what it takes What does it take? Well ... I haven't the foggiest idea, to be truthful ... but ... Listen ... Here we are, walking together in the woods And if you can aspire to be walking in the woods with your kids After they've made it as far as we've made it ... then ... I think you've done the right thing. That makes sense. It makes sense. Not really. But ... I think you understand me ... I do. Dad! What the fuck?! Dad. Where the fuck did it come from? Are you alright? Yeah yeah, I'm the war generation When we hear shots, we get down. You guys are running around like targets. You sure you're okay? - Yeah yeah I'm fine. Looks like a tiny calibre bullet. Looks like a .22. Some hunter probably shot one across our bow. Yeah, what's he hunting? Squirrel? He has a point. There shouldn't be anyone hunting right now. There's 2 ways we can go here we can hunt the fucker down ... sorry ... Or we can make our way back. Oysters. Huh ... Check them golden oysters! Look at those beauties. Hey, what we gonna do about the long gun? Nothing, nothing. We got our mushrooms, go back to our cabins and call it a day. Then later, I'll take our bounty after hours, head back into town And have them cook us a proper meal. Ah, Bonjour mes amis. Uh, you need any help? Brian, come to the kitchen. I'd love to help. What's he sayin'? I'm going to help Jacques with the dinner he thinks dad's a murderer in the kitchen. What, everybody speaks French but me? Jacques, can we speak in English? Ahh, I get carried away sometimes. Whatever that boy wants, he'll figure it out at some point. And you've got 15 years on both of ya. You forget what you were like when you were his age?

He thinks he can get a healthy Chinese baby on the black market for like 45,000 US. What? - Chinese. Like you want. He's got these kind of connections. He's an oil man. Really? - So what do you think? The black market? - Yeah. It sounds kinda shady. Does it? Or does it sound awesome?! Right. It sounds like a bad idea. Ok. Y'know, it's ... My little contribution, but um ... Parallel paths we pursue that way that's not working right now and I'll keep on going after my thing. We'll see who wins. Ok. - Ok.

Brian's in the middle of adopting A kid from China. Oh, so you would like ... - I don't get it. You've got fertile soil right next to you here. Are you not planning on sticking around, or is it an ammunition issue? Dad? - Harriet. Why do you think you and Ducky don't make a formal commitment? Is it because she works for you? You think it might be a conflict of interest So you just have a hotel relationship? I think I'll have the lamb ... ... and a free sal salad ... I think I'll have the clams. So ... seriously, I'm ... I'm just interested. Suppose this Chinese baby plan works And you get the kid, what's the long term finance structure? Who's the mother? Who provides the feminine support? What happens when the kid gets her period? I'm asking the tough questions. Go! The long term finance structure? Yeah, I assume you make peanuts at the mattress factory, On a meagre salary? Well, I guess we'll just eat less food. They don't eat a lot in China anyway, and they're much healthier so ... It'll be some cost-cutting measures like that, less food, no heat, et cetera You won't be laughing when the tuition bills come in And she wants a horsie or he wants a Countach. What's a Countach? It's ... it's a Lamborghini. A car. Well, it sounds totally preposterous somebody your age adopting a baby. No wife, No nothing. But I admire it. I admire the hell out of it. How old are you going to be anyway? I'm going to be 29. Christ to a cracker! You speak Chinese? - I'm learning. I speak a little Mandarin, pretty fluent Thai but that's the extent of my Asian language. How much do you make in the job? Well, it's a commission-based thing so, the more I sell the more I make.

Do you want me to go ask the security guard? Sweden have a quarter of the available light we have here in the US. And? And what does less light mean? - Shorter days. Yes, but more importantly longer nights. These motherfuckers know how to get themselves some sleep. Me, I sleep like the dead anyway but I cannot touch the Swedes, I'll tell you that. They outsleep everybody, but ... They are some depressed, suicidal niggers ... I'll tell you that for nothin' Where is that, Iceland? Anyway, be that as it may ... Can you hold on one second?

No Brian, don't go like that. - Sorry ... At least be mad at me ... - Sorry, I've got too much to be worried bout right now I'm going to go ... - Please just stay a little while? Sorry, that would be a little fucking easy. You're really enjoying your self-righteousness now, aren't you? I've an international power converter thing in my apartment if you need it. I got it in France when I was 18. You don't understand. There's ... something going on for a long time. Hello ... Hello? - Uhh, we're on our way. Now when I get to the house, I press the button with your name on it? What I don't understand is, how is the button big enough to hold your name? Name is next to the button, dad. Oh oh ok ... and the porter will clear it? - There's no doorman, dad. No porter? what d'ya mean, you mean no one? - No. Who does your shoes? Who take care of deliveries? - Dad, just ring the buzzer 'n I'll buzz you up. Ok? You'll figure it out when you get here? - Ok ok ... alright, see you there. Bye ... How do ya shut this off? Uhmm ... right there. - Hit the green, no, hit the red. Thanks for the cellphone. He's living in squalor. Hi. - Hi. I thought you'd already gone. My plane is supposed to leave tomorrow, but I thought I'd come by and get the power converter. What happened to your face? Uh ... a pickup game. - A pickup game? Yeah, some fratboys. Well, are you having a party? My folks are coming by and my brothers are coming too. Oh, God ... is there someone here? Maybe I should leave. Oh! - This is the little one. I thought you had to go to China. Uh, no, the agency called, this couple in Long Island flipped out and got cold feet. So, she's yours? Went out there last week, and we're celebrating one week together today. This is May. - Did you pick that? No, but I like it. Me too. She's beautiful. Yeah, I think so too. Let me get that thing. - Oh. Oh, the door? - Yeah, can you please buzz that? Stay there. Uh, think this is it. Should work in all of Europe. Brian, I wanted to talk to you a little bit more. Well, my entire family is bout to walk thru the door. - I know, I just wanted to apologise For acting out the other night and I'm really sorry for being so weird and I just wanna tell you that Alright, let's have a little look at the little Samurai. Samurai's Japanese, dad. - Akibonos, the little panda, where's she? Oh my God! She is the most darling thing I've ever seen. Can I hold her? Oh thank you. Barbara, we gotta apply and get one of these. You did it! So damn proud of ya! This is not just champagne. - Hey, everyone ... This is ... this is Happy. Oh I thought you were goin' off to become a chef, Happy. - Yeah, well, I uhmm ... I signed up for a cooking school on the internet ... It doesn't exist because it dissolved in 2004 and they didn't update the website ... I see ... - But I'm gonna study here in the city ... Marvelous! That's fantastic, because we need someone in this family who can cook. Because frankly, Barbara don't get ya nose outta the joint, collectively we can't make buttered toast. John Weathersby. Nice to meet you. - Get outta here. A toast, Brian? Why don't you do it Grandpa? You're good at it. - Mm, good ... I'll take that bait. I'm James. - Hi, I'm Happy. Since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness its limbs and outward flourishes Therefore, I shall be brief. Twait. - That's William Shakespeare, boy. May ... a new child, a new life, a new family ... Welcome, little May ... and love ... love love love You're in good kind hands. And here's to many many happy birthdays to come And I'll be at every one of them! Salud! - Salud! Brian, have you got any beer in the fridge? - No. Happy darling, would you like to come and ... to a deli and see if we can pick up some beer? There's a deli ... two blocks that way oh it's in here, the elevator ... Happy, I don't drink beer. It's okay dear. - I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. I really wanted to come to the dinner. - It's okay. I called my mother the other day. She ... She didn't know who I was at first. She doesn't call me on my birthday I'm sorry. When is your birthday? Uh ... June 9th. I was half a geezer, when I had that boy. He's been sweet his whole life. But he never had the family the other kids did. Everyone thought that we were his grandparents. He told his teacher once his real parents'd died in a car crash and his grandparents took him on. He did? Well, he was confused I guess. I don't blame him. It wasn't disloyal, he was just trying to make everything seem normal, I suppose. But nothing's normal. You guys seem pretty normal. We're not. You have a right to be worried I'm afraid. I'm just afraid that I fucked everything up beyond repair. Nothing's fucked up. Nothing's beyond repair. Thank you. You're welcome. Shall we go back? This could use a wall light or some kinda industrial screw. The pipe looks strong enough, the rope looks strong enough, leave the damn thing alone. Welcome back girls. Have a seat. Now, Happy ... For your benefit, I want you to know that For the kids when they were born I would make a piata of a famous dictator, Fill it with bitter honey. John, uh, had Stalin. James had Mussolini, And Brian, had Pol Pot. You see the progression? And this is Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi. Let's whack him. Now Happy, since May can't exercise her own honour, I'm sure She would want you to be the proxy whacker. Ok? - Ok. Blindfold her please. - Yes sir. Uhm Happy, you won't be able to break it with the first burst. You're only going to ... Put a start on it because of its superior workmanship. Over here. Attagirl. Straight. Here here, gimme that baby. C'mon c'mon ... Brian, there's a deuce loose in the caboose and I'm not well-versed in that detail. Champagne, cocktails, drinks ... c'mon everyone we must drink up, today is one big fuckin' day ...
