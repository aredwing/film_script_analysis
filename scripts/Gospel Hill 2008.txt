You can't give me a break. Just one break today. You cheap little- Battery's loose. John. John, telephone! - Who is it? It's a reporter from Aiken. Wants to talk to you about the memorial. Ah, I'm not interested. John, just something brief about your father. I got nothing to say. Uh! Mr. Harris, um, I'm sorry. He's not available right now. I'll have to take your number and have him call you back. Well, here's what we're lookin' at, Jack. The biopsy came back positive... which I wouldn't call a surprise. I've also got to tell you the cancer's spread. Now, I think the only option we have now... is chemotherapy or radiation. These are antiandrogens. I want you to start taking them right away. We've got to start you on chemo as soon as possible. Now, you can't fool around here. If you don't act on this, you might not be around in six months. You hear me? Here in the town of Julia, South Carolina... the citizens are preparing to celebrate the life of civil rights activist, Raul Malcolm. Next Tuesday marks the 40th anniversary of his tragic death. Some may remember his famous lunch-counter protest... where he was arrested for pointing out the injustice of segregation. Paul Malcolm was a true local hero. His legacy will be honored next Tuesday at Friendship Park. Yvonne, would you please just pick up the phone? I'm watching television. I- Hello? Yes. Of course I remember you and your lovely family. Uh-huh. How's the earache? Hey, your daddy a white Soul Train. And your mama's black as the bottom of my shoe. Zebra! Zebra! Zebra! Zebra! Zebra! Zebra! Hey! Hey, stop that! Sweetheart, what happened? - I'm not a zebra. - No, of course you're not. You come with me. Anna. Now what do you have to say to Anna? Go ahead. - I'm sorry. You? What do you have to say? - I'm sorry. All right, go ahead. Go to class. Anna- Oh. Sweetheart, what they said to you was trash, wasn't it? And what do you do with trash? - You throw it away. That's right. You throw it away for good. Okay, dry your tears and go on to class. - Yes, ma'am. Oh, I'm just sorry to take over, but I know these children pretty well. I understand. - You will soon enough. Oh, Sarah Malcolm. Rosie Griffith. Well, I'd been wanting to meet the new teacher. You're not from around these parts, are you? No. Well, day one. Didn't your parents teach you to knock? You supposed to listen to the drivers' complaints. I got complaints too. What about the fact that you're late more than you are on time... and when you are here, you flap your lips more than you work. You don't talk to me that way. Okay, you're fired. - You can't fire me. I just did. What am I 'posed to do for a job in this town? Why don't you go back to L. Donn, or you can cry about your leg to somebody. Go talk to the V.A. You'll get a job. It worked here, didn't it? Fuck you! Okay. What's the problem? About time. I'm sick of listening to that junk. $23.27. See, you're a lucky man, my brother. You work outside- Hey. Wow! Haven't seen her here before. Anyway, what was I saying? Oh, yeah, yeah. You own your own equipment, at least until the loans are paid off. You are a man in charge of his own destiny. And... now... you're incorporated. - For real? Yeah. You're lucky you have a lawyer for a brother to do this stuff for you, you know? How's it feel? It feels pretty darn good, that's how it feels. Uh-huh. I guess we should celebrate then, huh? To the businessman. Cheers. Hello? - Mr. Herrod? Yes. My name is Ray Harris from the Aiken Standard. I'm doin' a piece about the upcoming memorial for Paul Malcolm. I wanted to get your thoughts- - I got nothin' to say. Well, I'd really like to get your viewpoint for the article. This is a big event in town. Well, I don't think I'm gonna be an honored guest. Will you answer a few questions about your investigation of Malcolm's murder? Didn't nobody answer 'em for me. How you gonna arrest somebody for sittin' at a lunch counter? You know this isn't right. Since when is being hungry a crime, Sheriff? You askin' the wrong question, Sarah. What you need to be askin' is what you gonna do on Judgment Day, Sheriff? What you gonna say about arrestin' black folk 'cause they're hungry? What you gonna say about that? What you gonna say, Sheriff? You can't see what's ahead of you. Don't hate the sheriff, y'all. Y'all need to pity him. 'Cause he can't see what's comin'. - That's right. And it's gonna roll right over him... along with everybody else who don't realize we all the same. - Mm-hmm. It's right around the corner, and it's called "freedom." Freedom, that's right. - It belongs to you... the same as everybody else. - That's right. Now my hands are tied, but my soul is free as the ocean. Amen to that. - They gonna put me on the chain gang... but they can't chain my spirit- - That's right. 'cause I carry the light. And that light is called "truth." Y'all carry it too. You too, Sheriff. Come on. How you doin' over there? You don't have a flashlight, do you? As a matter of fact... I do. There you go. That's really cute. Oh, um, his sides. You want to squeeze- There it is. - Boy Scout, huh? Always prepared. - Yes, I am. Do you, uh-you mind if I take a peek for you? Please. - Oh, it's okay. What, uh- What's it been doin'? It sputters and then it stops. - All right, we got a '72. Yeah. I just bought it when I got here. All right. Let's give it a whirl. Oh, that's awesome. Thank you. Absolutely. I mean, this should- this should get you home, but, uh, if- I- I got it. If, uh- I'd definitely get it looked at... if I were you. Take care of this guy. Thanks. - Absolutely. I'm Joel. I'm Rosie. It's a pleasure. Phase one is a championship to be built in conjunction with townhomes. Excuse me. Oh, sure. - Then, in phase two... single-family homes will line the course itself... followed by larger, custom homes. And this is where we'd like to build it. Madam President? - Yes. Mrs. Malcolm. Do you intend to bulldoze Gospel Hill? Well, we're aware that some of the land is occupied... but we intend to offer fair market value to everybody. Tell me, what is fair market for the house that your great-grandmother was born in? Would you want to sell that house? Miriam, you cannot sell out Gospel Hill. It is not yours to sell. Sarah, uh, maybe we should hear the man out. I mean, uh, this could be good for these people. Where are they gonna go, Ron? - Well, I know we're all passionate about our heritage... but we have to be realistic. Oh, hell, Ron. Give me a break. You and I are blessed enough not even to share the same reality as these poor folks. Okay, uh, you can continue. Many homeowners are selling because of rising unemployment. In fact, most of the properties involved are rental properties owned by local residents. What's the appraisal, Duncan? I'm saying $40,000 is what I'm saying. I'm saying $40,000. I'm worried about this, uh, Sarah Malcolm. She's committed. It could be a problem. Well, it's personal to her. She'll come around. And it's not personal to you, now is it, Doc? No. You have to rise above that. - Uh-huh. I can handle Sarah. The way you handled her last night, I guess. Look, when she's done talking, she'll realize she can't win, and the vote will go down. Maybe we should put a little sugar in her coffee. That bring her around? Sarah Malcolm ain't ever gonna go your way, boys. I tell you right now, you're better off playing hardball. Hardball? What are you talking about? Look, look, stop. Please. I can handle her. Hey, if you don't, we can always up the stakes a bit. Look, I do not want to hear that. Duncan, just don't get reckless on us. - Ahh. Careful, it is. Careful, it is, boys. Uh, y'all, uh- y'all take care now. All right. Take 'er easy, Duncan. You'd better deliver what you say, Doc. To me you're a honeybee on a daisy. But most of these Valley Corp boys see you as a fly squatting on a cow pie. Hey, L. Donn. That, uh, business we were talking about? Mm-hmm? - We need to go ahead with that. So because of this one little girl in New Orleans- What's her name? - Ruby Bridges. That's right. Because she was brave enough to go into that school... even though she looked different from everyone else... even though people called her names and no one would sit with her, she still did it... so that everyone could have a better life. And this week we're celebrating the life of Raul Malcolm. He was a courageous pioneer for social justice, and he's from right here in Julia. Great. Line up. Hello? - Sarah. Ron Palmer. You left so fast we didn't have time to talk. I talked, Ron. - I know, you did. But these are powerful people. Just work with them on this. You know what this is about. They will move you out of the way if they have to, Sarah. Just think about it. Ohh! - Damn, man! What'd you do? Can you grab a rag out of the truck, please? Hey, shit, man. You're gonna need that thing attended to. I'll drive ya. You can drive this? - Man, I can drive anything. Come on. Come on. That you? Yeah, it's me. We cool? Yeah, we cool. I'm Joel. Man, just keep putting pressure on that thing. I'm Lonnie. All right, you know how to get to the hospital? We're gonna go to the clinic right down the road. Gospel Hill? We all bleed the same, brother. Come on. Aren't you gonna say hello? John Malcolm. Sometimes you are just an impossible man, you know that? Why is it every time something important comes up- I mean, truly important- you wanna go and stick your head in the sand... just like you do in that damn pickup. Well, what you expect me to do? - I expect you to stand up. That's the John Malcolm I once knew. Proud man, wouldn't be caught dead with his head down. Where's he? - Hey, you're not being fair, Sarah. Well, maybe not. But I need you on this, at least to support me. You can't fight them folks. You just being simple, Sarah. They want to build that golf course over Gospel Hill. I saw their map, John. Well, what does Ron Palmer say? Oh, please. He one of them behind it. Maybe Palmer's right. You don't mean that. Hey, listen, baby. They brought the factories here, 'cause there were poor people to work in 'em. And they found poor people somewhere else to take all the jobs. Hey, listen, baby. Maybe it's a golf course or nothin'. Wait, Sarah. What I think, what you think don't-don't matter. It don't matter. It don't- You got a ride home? I just live right down the road. I'm good. Hey, let me give you something for your troubles, man. That won't be necessary, man. I'll tell you what, though, you gonna need some help around here now. Oh, I don't think so, man. - Come on, man. I can do all you can do. I can sharpen them mower blades, don't mind the heat. Just lost my job at the mill. Man, I sure could use some work. See, I'm kinda used to working alone, so- Well, you used to have two hands. Now you got three. I'm sorry, Lonnie. I, uh- I don't think so. Your call, brother. We accept Medicare, Medicaid, Visa and MasterCard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You just need to get over here as soon as you can, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Mr. Herrod. Hi, Joel. - Hi. I'm Ron Palmer. Sit over here. Right up here for me, please. How'd you hurt your hand? Well, I was landscapin'. Oh. How long have you been doin' it? - Uh, not long. I actually just started my own company. - Oh. Congratulations. - Thank you. Oh, you're just gonna need a few stitches. You, uh-You're pretty crowded out here. I haven't been here much at all really. Well, why would you need to be? Can I ask you, uh, who does your landscaping? Oh, my receptionist's son. I throw him a bone every once in a while whenever I can. But, uh, between you and me, he's a lazy kid. Right. Now I do have some rental properties available if you're interested. Really? - Mm-hmm. I think I am interested. - Oh. We should talk about it. This is gonna sting a little bit. Hey. - Hi. Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. You forgot your bait. - Oh. Keep it. You never know, right? That's my scout. - Right. What happened to your hand? Oh, nothin'. I just cut it on this edger. You should really hire someone to do that for you. I, uh- I do. Me. Uh- What are you doin' later? I've got lesson plans. I teach at the elementary school. But I'm free Saturday night. - You are? I mean... great. I'll see you Saturday? Yeah. Ahh. Hi. - Hello. Um, I'm Joel Herrod. Dr. Palmer asked me to, uh, come by and pick up some property list. Oh, yes, of course. - Right. Hang on one second. - Thank you. There you are. - Oh, thank you. Mmm. - All right. You take care of that hand now. - Oh, I will. What? What you gigglin' about? - You'll never believe who that was. I assume it wasn't your husband, or I'd be shot through the head. It's not like you to be worried about jealous husbands. I've skated by this long. Mmm. That's what I like about you. Carl, you're easy. That's what they used to call me in law school- easy. Mmm. Were you the best? No, I skated. My friends are movers and shakers now. Well, didn't you ever want to be a mover and shaker yourself? I'm fine right where I am. Yeah, come in. I'm so sorry, Dr. Ralmer, I'm late. My old truck done broke down and I had to walk. Oh, that's perfectly fine, Calvin. Come on in. Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. I, uh- I won't keep you long. I just wanted to share some good news with you. - I sure could use it. Calvin, I don't want you to worry about these medical bills... that have been piling up on you. Yes, Lord. - Oh. Firstly, I'll make a few calls and get the hospital off your back. Now, secondly, I, uh- I see that there's another property that you own next door. And if you would, uh, sell that to me as well... I think I can sweeten the deal all the way around. Sir, I-I don't- I don't believe I'm gonna be able to do that. You see, that was my granddaddy's land... and it's been in the family ever since. And I was hoping to leave it to my kids after I'm gone. I understand, Calvin. Then I think, uh, $25,000 is what we should work with. $25,000? Sir, no disrespect, the house two doors down went for almost $40,000. $25,000 is what the appraisal came in at. I spoke with Mr. Duncan at the bank this morning. Dr. Palmer- You-You know, you're gonna be out of debt, Calvin. Debt-free. I'm gonna help you do that. Just put your mark here. See if you can get some of the Lord, Luther. Prayer. Hey. - Hey. What up, Joel? How you doin'? - How's the hand, man? It's gettin' better, you know. Can I, uh- I talk to you for a second? Sure, man. What's up? Well, uh, I actually came into a bunch of work lately. I was wonderin' if, uh- - Shit, yeah, man. I could pay you, like, eight bucks an hour. That's cool? Eight bucks, man. That's super cool, man. - All right. That's great. Thank you, man. - Thank you. All right, I'll see you soon then. - All right. All right. I'm gonna call you, man. - All right. You don't want to work for him. His daddy's an asshole. Man, he ain't his daddy. - They're all their daddy. And what, that's gonna keep you from gettin' a job, man? I'm lookin'. I thought it was easy for a vet, especially one like you. That's what you thought? That's what you thought, huh? Nigger, where the fuck you live at? I'm gonna get goin', Luther. You got those all right? - Yeah, I got 'em. You all right? - Yes, I'm all right. I just gotta catch my breath a little. What you need to do is just quit those damn cigarettes. Oh, yeah, you bet. I'm serious. - Yeah, you're serious. Boy, oh, boy. Your mom and I used to sit in this swing every night before goin' to bed. Somethin' about this swing... seemed to make the day end right. Got married in this house. You know, you're not supposed to see the bride before the wedding. Yeah, I know. - Well, when I turned around... saw her standing there... I figured... the rest of my life was taken care of. Yeah. Niggers hadn't turned it all to shit. No, you know what? You know what? You can say whatever you want in your own home. But this? This is my home now. Mom left it to me. Oh, I see. Well! You don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about, do ya? I do. I think you're the one that just doesn't understand, Dad. When y'all gonna say somethin' different to me? No. It's a waste of breath. How was the movie? Just like every other film that plays in this town. You been busy? - Contracts. We have acquired three new properties today. Doing well. Closed the deal. Moving on to the, uh, bigger, better deal. Mmm. That's good. That's good? What, that's all you can say, is "that's good"? Ron, you know I don't care nothin' about ownin' no houses. Oh, it's not about the houses, Yvonne. It's about the property. The real estate. I mean, these opportunities are too good to pass up. There's opportunities everywhere. What do you want to be, the biggest catfish in the creek? Are you-Are you happy with this small-town living? Yvonne, look. I'm doing all I can to build this clinic so that we can get out of here- I am tired of living in this small country town. Oh, not again. - Yes, again. Look, I am sick and tired of hearing this! I don't come from what you do. Your daddy didn't want to help us, and, quite frankly, I didn't see you fight for it. So this is how you do it. You see an opportunity, you take advantage of it. You grab it. And then you build, and you do it again until you get where you want to be. That is how it works. Now, Carolina Textile has plans to build a blue jean factory... in your hometown of Julia, and you're blocking the project. These people are being asked... to give up their homes for the chance to get the job- a chance. These jobs aren't a certainty. The only thing that's certain is that their homes will be gone. Now, if that's the case, why can't they build somewhere else? And we all know the answer to that. Because the cheapest land is the land where the poorest folks are. Textile's big business in your state. You're a controversial man. Now, you could create some powerful enemies with your position on this project. That concern you at all? - I am not opposed to development. These jobs will be a welcome boost to these people... if they materialize. My only concern's for Julia. That what's best for Julia is best for all of Julia. It's been 40 years since Raul Malcolm sat down with our reporter... for that historic interview... and today his legacy lives on. As our tribute to Paul Malcolm continues- Hello? Sarah Malcolm? - Mmm, yes. Don't go to that meetin'. You want to end up in the same hole as your father-in-law? Who is this? - Stay away from that meetin'. What? Do I know you? - You heard me. Oh, you go to hell! Who was that? - Just some kids prank callin'. # The corn, the gasoline # # Goin' sky-high # # Cost too much to live # # And it cost too much to die # # Feel like throwin' up both of my hands sometimes # # Sayin' to myself # # What's the use # Luther? Luther, honey? What is it, Grandma? You goin' out? I don't know. What you need? - I don't need nothin'. It's just that I thought you might go out and have some fun, that's all... instead of just sitting all day. It's Saturday night. You ought to be out with the young folks. All right, Grandma. I'll go out. You takin' me to church in the mornin'? Sure, Grandma. I'll take you to church. You're a fine boy, Luther. The Good Lord gonna take care of you. Yeah? When that's gonna be? # Yeah, yeah # # Yeah, yeah # - # Yeah, yeah # # Yeah, yeah # # Yeah, yeah, yeah # - # Yeah, yeah # # Yeah, yeah # Ohh! - # Yeah, yeah # All right, you have to tell me. Where did you learn to dance like that? - In a good dive bar. Really? - Mm-hmm. Huh. Well, I tell you right now, I'm very impressed. Thank you very much. - Very impressed by you. I'm gonna have to take some lessons. If that's all right? Oh, oh, oh, oh! Yeah, I'm with ya, I'm with ya, I'm with ya. - Come on. Bring it, bring it. From country to rap. I'd kill for those moves. So this is your place. - It's cute, isn't it? Be quiet though. The neighbors. - Okay, I'll turn it off if you let me get your door. All right? - Okay. Okay. - Wait, wait, wait. I have to ask you a question. Okay. Shoot. It's about your dad. I'm not my father. No, I know. Absolutely not. I -I understand that. It's just that I read all these articles about Paul Malcolm before I moved here... and how your dad was this really popular sheriff. Uh, so I hear. Yeah. How come he couldn't solve a murder... in such a small town? Well, he just couldn't. Do you ever ask him about it? Uh, no, I don't. Why? I-You're his son. I guess there's just things you can't talk about, you know? Paul Malcolm bled to death in an open street. My father's a real good man. He's a real good man. I'm sure you're a good man too. # He came with a trauma He's leaving on a stretcher # # Somebody should have told him # # Now he's no better # You got Morrison, Chestnut, Lee Crawl. But I'm thinking you pick up Oakland, and, um, that'd be good. Then we'll be all set. Uh-huh. Okay, all right. That's good. That sounds good. That's good. All right. All right, well, we'll talk on it tomorrow. Okay. I'm gonna work on these a little bit longer. All right. Night-night. What's that? - A petition. And you signin' it. No, I ain't. You remember when we first met... registering people to vote, and it was your idea? It was my daddy's. Well, whosoever idea it was... you was willing to go to jail back then for what you believed in. Yeah. That's the definition of a fool. Not mine. - Well... maybe you are too. - John Malcolm... you watch your mouth. I know you care about this. You think you gonna win? Well, I'm willing to fight. You-You gonna lose. And everybody knows it 'cept you. Well, I'm not gonna give up, John. When you fight and you lose... it proves that they're stronger. And you can't do nothin' but lose. Look at these hands. So big and strong. I remember when I first saw you with those poor, frightened farmworkers... tellin' 'em how to stand tall when they were so afraid. You were the biggest of 'em all. I remember thinkin' that's a man who's gonna leave footprints. Still growin'. But when he ready, John Malcolm's gonna blossom... and we gonna follow him just like we do his father. You will always be that man. Hey, what's up, man? Hey, how you doin', young man? Well, you know- Grandma. You goin' inside? I don't feel like singin'. I hear that, brother. I ain't felt like singing since I got back from that sand trap. I just can't find it. Yeah. # Then I heard my mom say it # # But when I heard my grandma say it # # That's when I knew I had to change my life and make it right # # I'm gonna keep a-holdin' on # # I'm just gonna keep holdin' on # # Holding, holding on # # You got me holding on # - # Higher # # You got me holding on Glory, hallelujah # # Ohh, ohh # # Holding I'm holding on, Lord # # Holding I'm holding on, Lord # # Gonna keep holding I'm holding on, Lord # # Gonna keep holding I'm holding on, Lord # Breathe. Breathe. # Keep holding # - # Keep holding # # Keep holding # - # Keep on holding # # Keep holding # - # Keep on holding # # Keep holding # # Keep holding # # Keep holding # - # Holding # Hallelujah! Whoo! Hallelujah! Keep holding on! Oh, I heard somebody say, "Hold on to God's unchanging hands." Amen! Amen! - Amen. Amen. Oh, it's all right to bless in church. It's all right to bless him. A men. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. - It's all right to praise him. A men. Oh, it's all right to glorify him, because he's worthy. He is worthy to be praised! I know you all are lookin'forward... to the Raul Malcolm Memorial that's on this week. Amen! - Amen. And bless the Lord for brother Malcolm. - Amen. So to honor brother Malcolm... we have invited his close colleague... that actually served with him on the chain gang. Amen, somebody. - Amen. Please help me in welcoming the Reverend Charles Jones. Yeah. Welcome, brother! Welcome! A very gracious good morning, church. - Good morning. I want to tell you a story... as we get ready for the honoring of brother Malcolm. Yes, that's right. We were on the chain gang. I was sweatin'. I was getting low. Didn't know whether I could go again. - He said, "Boy, we're riding on a boat to change." Amen! - He said, "You God's child now." Yeah! You ain't gonna let nobody turn you around either. He said, "Remember the ancestors. "Remember the ancestors. They went through stuff you could not imagine." You know, I have a- a boy of my own. I call him a boy because, well, he's my boy. - And he's 20 years old. But when I look in his eyes I see the laughter of a boy... and the wisdom of a man. I call him my hero. And that's what he'll always be to me. # Sail on freedom # # Hallelujah # - # Hallelujah # # Hallelujah # - # Hallelujah # # Hallelujah # - Hey, come on. Come here. # 'Cause there ain't no harm # # You got time to sail on freedom # # I said there ain't no harm # # That you can't conquer with your mind # # Sail on freedom # # You know there ain't no harm # # That you can't conquer with your mind # # Sail on freedom # # Every church now they know # # Hallelujah # - # They praise the Lord # # Hallelujah # # Hallelujah # # You can leave a message or not. But if you don't and I see you around- - Hey, Herrod, it's Andrew Frank calling. Man, I have not talked to you in forever. Listen, I want to make sure you got that letter I sent you. This Valley Corp thing is just nuts. They are taking over everything. I hear they're voting on the proposal for Julia tomorrow. These are bad guys, Carl. They don't give a damn about anybody. I want to take them on, but I need your help. Man, you have my number. Call me back. How the hell am I gonna do this? Did you see what happened over there? - No, but I heard about it. Hey, Joel. How's business? Pretty good, L. Donn. - Good. Well, you know, if it turns to shit, you can get your old job back. Hmm. Well, you know, I think I'll be just fine. I, uh- I appreciate the offer. - Good. You know, that brother of yours is a big pain in my ass. Why is it every nigger I fire knows his phone number? 'Cause I leave a big stack of cards outside your office. L. Donn, you have no idea how much money I made off of you. I owe you. Well, I owe you too. You know, come to think of it... I've got an ax handle out in the back of my truck right now got your name on it. Is that a fact? Yeah. Suppose you and me go outside. Let me show it to you. That's okay. You hang on to it. I'm sure you misspelled my name anyhow. Well, I'm sure you'll get a close look at it one day, Herrod. That's a good guy right there. - Yeah, a sweetheart. Hey, my brother, word on the street is you had yourself a little date... over at the Ponderosa, huh? Jesus Christ, this town is small. Okay if I tell Dad so he can get off your back? I think both of us know that ain't gonna happen. Well, Mr. Malcolm, the good news is that you are the picture of health. I'm sure you weren't concerned. No, not about my health. Well, I have to say I am surprised that you came here for your physical. Well, I figured you a real good doctor... seeing how successful you are. - Oh, well, thank you. But unfortunately I have to supplement my income here. Yeah. Black man can't make it on one thing, can he? But I don't need to tell you what it's like to be black. Uh, no. You have to always keep an eye out for opportunities. Yeah. Good opportunities. Well, you know the time to grab the biscuits is when the biscuits is passed. Yeah, as long as you, uh, save some for the next man. Right? Right. Well, it's good to see you today, Mr. Malcolm. Hope you never find the need to come back. Never know, do you? All right, well, it looks like you're all set, so, uh... let's say, uh - say I pick you up in, uh, four hours? Sounds good to me, man. All right. Come on. Let's go. All right, put your seat belts on. # Nobody knows what # # King Cotton have done to me # # Nobody knows what # # King Cotton have done to me # # Took my people from home # # Rut us in misery # # Can't stand to look at rum, tobacco, sugarcane # # Well, I can't stand to look at # # Rum, tobacco, sugarcane # Hello? Jack, Bob Owens. - Hi, Doc. So, when are you planning on coming in for treatment? Jack, you there? - I'm here. You taking your antiandrogens? I'll get to it. - I know what you're thinking, Jack. It's not too late. Do you hear me? We can beat this. Yeah, that's what you said. I'm not gonna force anything on you. I'll talk to you. How'd it go today? Hey, Joel, man, I can't do this no more. Everybody around here, they know me. So? These folks used to own these houses. Now they rentin' 'em. They rentin' their own homes. You know you work for me, not Dr. Palmer, right? Look, I'm gonna come by next week and get my check. No. We'll square up now. I'm sorry, man. Don't be. Come on over now, y'all. Joel? - Hey, Dr. Palmer. How are you? - Good. It's good to see you. - Good to see you too. Hello. Ron Palmer. I'm sorry. Rosie Griffith, Dr. Ron Ralmer. Nice to meet you. This is my wife Yvonne. We met the other day actually. Yeah. Well, would you like to join us for dinner? Oh, we can't. I'm cooking. - Yeah. Oh, that's-that's too bad. I- I thought maybe you'd join us, and we could talk about some business. I'd like that actually. Um- That'd be great. - I'm gonna go and get a table. Okay, darling. - It's good to see y'all. Um, I'm sorry. Maybe, uh, another night. I'm sure we'd love to go for dinner. Of course. Just give me a call. - Will do. Nice to have met you. - Mm-hmm. Enjoy. - You too. Sorry about that. - Oh, don't be. How do you know that guy? Oh, Dr. Palmer? He's actually my biggest client. Why? - No. Nothing. Thanks for understanding. - Oh, I don't. You're just too pretty to argue with... so I just kinda just roll with it, you know? Mm-hmm. - Right. # I got a hunger for the mike # # My appetite strikes late at night # # Food for thought Hold down the fort # # Up in the border riches Last seen given stitches # # Blood gushin', I think I hear sirens, commotion # # Still showin' from the war potion # # Hey. - Hey. Oh. What are you so jumpy about? I thought you was somebody else. - Oh, yeah? Who? Nobody. Nobody. What are you doin' here tonight? Huh. Well, I guess her husband had other plans. The life you lead. Yeah. I know what you're thinkin'. I don't need to hear it again. Just kick back and enjoy our 12-pack bonding experience. Ahh. Looks like ol' Joel's got himself a date. Really? - Yeah. He's got his eye on the new schoolteacher. Hmm. That's good. I worry about that boy. He feels too much. What about me? You know, I feel too much, Dad. You were born not givin' a damn. That's not true. Well, you don't care... who's money you take... or whose wife you sleep with. You drank your way through that law school... I worked my butt off to pay for. You don't give a damn about nothin' and you never have. You know it. Go on then. Tell me. What the hell do you care about? You know, we can go inside if you're cold. No, I love it out here. Listening to the crickets? Hmm. It's so peaceful. Well, I'm glad to know you like somethin' down here. There's a lot that I like down here. - Really? You know, I feel like- I gotta figure out what to say to Dr. Palmer. I mean, it just felt awkward not- Just walking away like we did tonight, you know? I wouldn't worry about him. Yeah. Well, he's not your boss, so- I don't know, Joel. I don't think he's a good person. I heard him at the city council meeting the other night. He had no sympathy for the people affected by the Gospel Hill project. I think he's affected. I mean, he's got a lot of properties in Gospel Hill. He just wants to make money. What's wrong with making money? I mean, you gotta live on somethin', right? You can't displace people to make money. They've been living in those houses for generations. You know, maybe it's just business. Maybe this golf course is what everyone needs. Maybe everyone will benefit. What? I don't know. Before I got Dr. Palmer as a client... I was scrapin' by. And now I got a ton of clients. I can see myself gettin' out of debt. And believe me, I couldn't see that before. I don't know. It just feels like... I have a future, you know? I have somethin' to look forward to now. Tomorrow in Julia members of the community... are expecting a big turnout for the Raul Malcolm Memorial. It's been 40 years since Raul Malcolm's assassination. Despite an extensive investigation... local officials were never able to bring a perpetrator to justice. After 40 years with no leads and few living witnesses... it seems this crime will remain unsolved. In other news, it looks like the city- Mr. Malcolm? - Mm-hmm. I'm Rosie Griffith. I teach with Sarah. Oh. My wife sent ya. Yes, sir. She said you were the man. She doesn't believe that all the time. What's she doin'? - It runs really rough. Then it stops and won't start again. - Hmm. Hmm. Well, I think I can fix it. Let's see- You see, you have the fuel line- Might have to pick up another distributor at the salvage yard. Won't cost you too much. - Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Hmm. - I don't have to tell you what teachers live on. Yeah, my wife tells me all the time. I have so much respect for Sarah. Well, it's hard not to. It's your first school? - It's my second. My first year was at this suburban school. You know, great facilities, good students, good teachers. It was too civilized really. Listen, Mr. Malcolm... I've been teaching my students about what happened here... during the civil rights movement in the '60s. I know that it must've been really hard for you to lose your father like that- murdered by a white man. How do you know it's a white man? Well, wasn't he? I don't know that. Somebody must know. Yeah. Somebody must. He was gunned down in broad daylight. There were witnesses around that said they didn't see anything. I mean, these were black people. - Ah, they had no choice. Everybody has a choice. - Mm-mmm. No. You have a choice. Your parents have a choice. Those folks had one choice, the same as my daddy- stand quiet or lie quiet. I understand the choice that your father made. You don't understand. You can't possibly understand. Here. Gimme your hand. Now, you see that? Hmm? It's not your doing. But you'll never in your life understand. Mr. Malcolm. Mr. Malcolm. So, I hear you didn't get your car fixed. It was a misunderstanding. Yeah, well, he's in pain. But a lot of people are. You can't be afraid of other people's pain. I'm not afraid. I just don't like being put in a box and labeled. Uh! Well, you will get used to that. I shouldn't have to get used to that. - No. But it's a sure fact of life. And here's something else you're not gonna like. Once a lot of black people in town find out who you goin' around with... they won't be so friendly. What about who I am? What I think, what I feel? It goes both ways. Hey, Lonnie. What's up, man? - What it do, Luther? Where you goin'? Have some of this. Nah, I gotta get on back. Take her home and come on back and get your head right. Nah, I told my wife I'm gonna help with dinner and stuff, man. Dinner and stuff? Nigger, you 'posed to be the man. Trust me. I am the man. But I ain't your nigger. Anyway, a man don't sit around here drinkin' no 40-ouncer when there's work to be done. Later, Luther. Hey, brother. How you doin' today? Not as good as you, brother. If I was any better, they'd have to bury my ass. All right. Take care. Hey, brother? Stay strong. Strong. Fuck you! You know- - Just talk to me. Tell me what it is. We can figure it out. Well, this isn't gonna work out, you know, Yvonne. What? - Well, you know, I- Well, wait. Are you telling me that you lost the love? Is that what you're trying to tell me? - No, it's just- What's the point, huh? I'll remind you. It's okay. Have a drink. Come on. Have a drink with me. - No. I don't wanna have a drink. I don't wanna talk. I just want you to go. Okay. I'll leave. But if you think that's gonna solve your problems, Carl, you're wrong. It's a start. I'm sor- Hi. - Hi. You look cute. Come on in. Uh, wait. Um- I-I can't come to dinner tonight. Why? I don't think that we should see each other anymore. What? I-I can't do this. What'd I do? - Nothing. It's nothing that you did. Then what is it? It's just who you are. Wait. Whoa. Wait! Hey. What do you mean, "who you are"? What I mean is that you and I are different. You owed me 'bout five dollars for, like, a whole year, and I ain't said nothin'. Don't you feel for Joel? Oh, h-how can you even ask me that? 'Cause you're just sittin' there feelin' so sorry for yourself. Why you always gotta throw blame around all the time? Hmm? I mean, you wanna blame somebody, look in the mirror. What did I do? - Come on, man. I mean, listen to yourself. "Niggers" this, "niggers" did that. She broke up with Joel because of you. Maybe you oughta look at your own life. You don't know about my life. Don't I? Always easier to blame someone else than it is to look at your own self. I guess that makes you the nigger, huh? All right then. - Carl. Carl. Do you think I like feeling this way? Well, how do you wanna feel, Dad? I wanna feel somethin' else. Raul Malcolm. He... was a man who stood up. He did what was right. Why didn't you? Same reason as everybody else. Didn't want to end up like your daddy. Somethin' I'll never be able to get right. The men in this town... had their way with just about... everybody- includin' me. I didn't mind being their boy. I thought it was the road to the top. I didn't believe that they- they'd kill a man... because he stood between them and the bank. And they ran right over me. How could you live with that, Herrod? I'm about done. That's the way it is for you. But it doesn't give me any satisfaction. I'll go to my grave... never having seen the man that killed him. What would you do if you did? I don't know. But I'd do somethin'. Then I'll take ya. Let's go. Ernest Hatch. Yeah? I want you to meet... John Malcolm. This here is Ernest Hatch. He was a- a rich man's puppet, just like me. Huh! Ernest here is the man that shot your daddy dead. Is this what you want? No. No. Well, hello, Doc. You know you're not gettin' it done with Sarah Malcolm. But you know what this means to us. It's time to play hardball. We gotta stop her. L. Donn'll take care of it. You just stay out of the way. Good luck at the meetin'! # Well, I been workin' all of these years, you know # # All I got is the blues # # I work, work, work Yeah # # What do I have to show # # The only thing I ever get, y'all # # Is a hard damn way to go # # Sometime I feel like throwin' up my hand # # Feel like sayin' What's the use # # All I have all these years of workin' hard # # All I have is the blues # # I work, work, work, y'all # # Still can't save a cent # # Time I pay my rent, my house No, you see # # My money's already spent # # Lord, I feel like throwin' up both of my hands sometime # Hello? - John? This is Ron Palmer. Yeah. - Things have gotten out of hand. L. Donn is gonna do something to Sarah. We're back to order. This is it, boys. I think everything's gonna go our way. We are here to vote on the proposal put forth... by Valley Corporation to rezone Gospel Hill. Is there any further discussion on the matter before we go to the vote? Yes, Madam President? Yes, Mrs. Malcolm. Go ahead with your question. I have a petition here signed by members of our community stating that... we, in effect, oppose the development project. Mrs. Malcolm- - Where is it written... that what is good for the people must not inconvenience the powerful? Sarah, please. Enter the petition. Madam President, if I may, let me reiterate... the tremendous growth potential and benefits that will come to this community. What community? If it's only in the interests of the whites and the affluents... that merits consideration, then... how is that a community? Madam President, I suggest that the council... is ready for a vote. Miriam, we are not ready to take a vote at this time. The people must be heard! - I believe the people have been heard. I think it's time to vote on this issue. Miriam, would you ask the good doctor how much he's getting from Valley Corp? I'd be very interested in knowing that. - Sarah, that is not appropriate. May I interject, please? Oh, here we go. Uh, yes. Come forward. L. Donn Murray? Yeah. What about it? Go to hell. Miriam, I am still speaking. Excuse me, Madam President. I just wanted to ask if anybody in this room was familiar... with Antonio Gonsalvez, attorney at law. - Dr. Ralmer? You must know who he is. Mr. Gonsalvez was a community leader in Obregon, Texas... where Valley Corp built a casino resort. With the support of Mr. Gonsalvez... Valley Corp was able to displace much of the Latino community... with the promise of future employment which never materialized. Friends of mine in the Texas Attorney General's office... have informed me that Mr. Gonsalvez... has received a sizable amount of Valley Corp stock... in exchange for helping to shepherd this project through. Mm-hmm. This sound familiar now, Dr. Ralmer? I think we've heard enough. The council is ready to vote. I been lookin' all over this dead-ass town for work... and I can't find nothin'. I was the best driver you ever had, and you know that! Goddamn you, Jack Herrod! You be on time in the mornin'. # Well, in the mornin'# # When I rise # - # When I rise # How you doin', Mr. Malcolm? - # # # When I rise I wanna rise boldly # # When I rise # # Boldly # - # When I rise # # Early in the mornin'# - # When I rise # # Early in the mornin' # - # When I rise # # Won't hear lies Won't doubt the Father # # Won't hear lies, Won't doubt the Father # - # Lord # # When I # # When I # # Rise # # Evenin'. Evenin'. Most of my life I- I lived in my f-father's shadow. The darkness of that shadow kept me from... hearin' his true voice. And the pain I felt f- from losin' him- I can't describe it. I grew up... right- right down there. That road right down there. I was raised with my father's love and kindness... a-and a mission... to do what's right. After he was taken from us... I stopped believing in that mission. I didn't believe we had the power to change the way things are. Tonight, I see the spirit of Raul Malcolm... in my wife Sarah and in all of you. Because of her leadership and your unity and courage... Gospel Hill can remain a home for us all. I-I wish that for-for all- all your children. I hope- I hope they grow up in a community... like mine. A community... named after the word of God. Named after the word of God. - Amen. Gospel Hill. - Amen. Amen. Gospel Hill. All right. - Amen. A- Amen. # You can't turn me around # # Oh, no # # Oh, no # - I'm so proud of you. # Oh, no # # Oh, yeah, just # - # Keep on movin' on # # Lord, I gotta keep on # - # Keep on movin' on # # Keep on movin'# - # Keep on movin' on # Peace, brother. Peace be with you. Mr. Malcolm. Considering the state of the country and the recent shootings of Dr. King and Senator Kennedy... aren't you concerned about your own safety? Dr. King and Senator Kennedy aren't the first to pass on. There are people dyin' all over the world for what they believe in. No, no. No, I don't wanna die. But I can't live in fear either. That ain't livin'. Only thing I'm afraid of is God. And there have been many who have fallen at the hands of others. Men kill and men die... but the world is still here. When I'm gone- when all y'all are gone- the world will still be here. And the work... will keep goin' on. Amen to that. - Thank you, brother. We're with you, Mr. Malcolm. - Stay strong now.
