There were times when we spoke little... ...and other times... ...nothing. Who is this guy? Dr. Scully. Sympathetic, but something crazy. Do you attend the doctor, right? Who told you that? Do you trust a doctor who drives a taxi mauve? None who have consulted me avail. Not even have made me laugh. Dr. Scully at least get it. I did not know hardly anything about Jerry. Neither he me. What was ideal for a solid friendship... ...born random encounter in the wilderness. In his company I forgot. I forgot everything. That is, the essentials. We walked for hours. Fatigue clouded my memories. I had sought refuge in this country... ...whose beauty intoxicated hearts. Mine was particularly fragile... ...and certainly by the fragility... ...anguish felt by the beauty of the landscape... ...which, we thought, Jerry and I... ...secretly kings. What the hell are you doing? Ignorant. Hunter of shit. Who are you? Hover head, blockhead, and see. Jerry... ...Do not move. Stay there. No, Jerry. What's the matter, scared? No, but it hurt my dog?? Dirty pig. Drop the gun. I'd Better go see the dog of his friend. You have to be stupid. Shoot the ducks when they are still. Be careful. - You are mad. - Yes, see if you serve something. Go. This is nothing. A scratch. Where have left the car? Down there. Well, come to my house. Help me lift him... No, you do not. - I do not inspire confidence. - Come, little one. There. This will be all right. Three or four shot in the ass not kill a dog. Get well soon. There was no reason shoot him. I did not shoot against EI but against this puppet. My name Keen. Mr. Jeremy Keen... ...Whose father kneaded million. Intended rid of the weight of his fortune... ...Making it taken by a peasant. No, I live as I please. What more could you ask to be happy? Perhaps whiskey... Mr. Marchal? Yes, thank you. How do you know my name? Memory. Everything in life is matter of memory. Yes, we know, I remember very well you, friend. Not me and I have good memory. Sagora, Morocco. Decade ago. Do not you remember anything about this? His jeep got stuck in a quagmire. Another jeep and took him out of there. At the wheel... I remember the incident. But not you. You had gone there to write an article on... False... do not know what Third World problem. Article which of course I have not read. - How bad was it? - Malsimo. No. It was excellent, but partial. - Thank you. - Mr. Keen? - No thanks. - A Keen who does not drink. Wow, man. It seems America has been emptied of blood... ...the Irish. No, a Keen only drink with friends. Very well said. My respects, Mr. Keen. Hello, I am Jerry Keen. Do not Be Afraid. She does not speak. Yeah? Well, fine gentlemen. Encountered with Mr. Tubelmann. Yes. That man Tubelmann I think it has something Jewish. Do not surprise me. Do not ever pay their bills. And also... ...Who knows if it's one of those Nazi war criminals? - Is not that much for one person? - Well, there's more. Her daughter rides horses, but always alone. And another thing. Never talk to anyone. Is dumb. This means that people believe him. Yes, Mush. - Margaret Colin, my only love. - Do not say those things, Mush. - At his age. - At my age? I have no age. Everyone knows it. The truth is I was young was serious and I felt old. And now I feel young and want to have fun. Sing, dance, and Paris. One man like you. I have nothing to not have others. If not, you know. How are you today? - When he was in Paris? - In the right age, dear Philippe. And five years. Was the only place where a Irish could lose his virginity... ...At that time. And to be frank, I'll tell... ...I feel nothing the lost without her. - Doctor Scully. - Excuse me, Margaret. Do not do it again, I promise. By the way, Philippe... ...I hope you decide to not look much navel. The navel is death. Yes, I know. Tina. Tina. How are you? - How are you today? - Not good. What? Well, yesterday or so. - It's hard as a rock. - But... Rocks sometimes crack. If you ever feel sick, sure is. It is.. Tina and I have come to see how it Pack. It's Better, thanks. But come. Thank you. Breakfast? No. I brought a snipe. Thank you. Please sit down. I have not slept well. Pack was windy and he kept moaning. I did not want to move... ...That would open the wound again and bleed. And when at last I fell asleep... ...The phone rang. My parents never take into account... ...The time difference with New York. What? Comes Sharon. Sharon? Yes, my sister. Is that? Is it, yes. Do not you want? Sure. Do the cause you're here? No. I transferred some limits... ...And it was decided that a return to place of origin... ...would be healthy. After all of this came the first Keen for America... ...In time of famine.

Yes, subject to railways. - You know my family? - No. But it's the classic story. As classic as your current situation. The third generation tends to have problems.

You have got to be HRH Princess of Hanover... And the family is sent... ...For submission to the effects air purifiers Irish. Do not believe it. No doubt her husband requested to be present.

Good morning. Mr. Keen, centuries ago not see him. - Whiskey takes a. - Sure, Billy. Centuries ago did not see. Do you drink whiskey? The is up in arms, Mr. Keen. Do you have jealousy, Tubelmann? Yes, I'm dying of jealousy. Let them alone. Right. I'll let the butterflies in fragile peace. Dear Friends... ...Let the pretty fairy England live in peace in Ireland. Let the Irish and the English fix their problems. 'Even in horse racing? Even in horse racing. And also in the Derby? - I won the Derby. - I know, I was there. And I admire the way you use the whip just before arrival. It fell between the legs of the horse English... ...And forced him to swerve. What cunning. - Good morning. - Here is the doctor. Sean... Sean... ...Is a great pleasure to see increasingly strong and sober. You see doctor, each does what he can. Good for the effort. Keep it up. Good morning. - He's drunk. - No excuse. No need, Mr. Lynch. You are excused entirely. Put that on my account. Does your account? I'm not stupid enough to fiarle. M.

Will go up at the airport his sister the princess. You will be delighted to see her again. I have to say some things that will interest. Sean, let's go home. The operator of the plant is an angel.

The last time I took so many oysters was in New York. I was in jail. Everyone brought me oysters. True. Shit, I cut to eat. I received a visit from the police, journalists... ...The mayor of New York... ...Even the governor of the state. For me it was all New York without oysters. Can you imagine a boy of sixteen years behind bars? I do not want to be indelicate, but what did in jail? Mr. Keen... ...I had a dad that I protect with a mattress dollars. I arrived in New York a Sunday morning. Traveled without a ticket on a freighter. Everything had a look desert, dead. In rats America to throw a party on Sunday. In the spring I met with a German shepherd enormous. Was a fierce animal slobber dripping appalling. I looked, came to me and allowed stroke. I told him to lie. Lie. Lie. Stretched himself out. The police were amazed... ...Because they are trained to attack to guys like me. I was very thin then, but be surprised. Delgado as a flute. In the police station the dog would not leave me. Then came... ...A journalist, one of those geniuses failures. A very American specialty. A type preserved in whiskey or gin. A Yellow Runs so... No. Roonie, Yellow Roonie. That's it. In the twenty years that they had him as the first poet. U.S. As an Ezra Pound. But, moving on. Yellow Roonie told the story in his newspaper. The next day came a crowd of reporters and photographers... Wanted to know... ...The secret of the boy who tamed the perrazos. Then I said... ...'Only tell you what if you give me vodka and oysters.' You and New York people throw... ...I got a mountain of oysters and a barrel of vodka. I needed to find a way out and said, 'It's a gift.' 'This is a method to tame dogs staff.' The next day out of jail... ...Because a crazy old woman had paid the deposit... ...To go to care of their dogs. Was about thirty in his mansion on Park Avenue. Was completely crazy, poor thing. Name was... ...Olivia Pennyhurst. What did you say your name was? Pennyhurst. Aunt was you. I talked to Charles Frederick the last time we met. About three or four years. Want to join? Enter. Hello? Hello? I wish to speak with West Germany. With Vogelsburg, the 8017. Eight dozen oysters... ...Five liters of beer... ...Not bad for a man only. That's it. Is there much delay? Then, great. I hope. - Have you believed that story? - No. But it could be true. Even the Yellow Roonie. They published his biography last year. Aunt says she met Olivia. It's a great guy. That little detail at the right time. What do you mean? Suddenly... ...Comes up with something that relates directly... ...one of us... ...And the whole story is plausible. - Hello, Frederick Charles. - Are you in Germany? Not in Ireland. Jerry needed me. I'll spend the week with him. - You could spend Christmas with me. - I can not wait, dear. Here is something curious. I have dinner with a guy named Tubelmann. Aims to meet you. Tubelmann? Yes, it has long lost its track. I think we met during the war. It's a big guy, right? Says see you make three or four years. Married Still the German pianist Mary... ...Mary Schmitt of Tasso? No idea, certainly not with him. No, now I remember. Died in a plane crash. Telefoname prior to arrival to prepare your apartment. Yeah, okay, bye, darling. I should have told to come. I'm sure it would like. I would go hunting in the morning... ...And spend the evening with his dear old friend. Tubelmann. They could talk about Mary... - ...Mary Schmitt... - Del Tasso. - Yes, that is. What touched the piano? - Schubert. It's perfect. A loves Frederick Schubert. At least we know that Tubelmann there. Are you sure? Pass. Breakfast awaits you. Thank you, Collin. To Dr. Scully not make him grace to know... ...Who has spent the night in the tavern. I have not been there. But the last time I was there went with him. He can afford a small excess occasionally... ...Because you know he's a saint. Have Paris in the cabin. Pass. Thank you. Good day, Do you know what happened little Michael? I have been to the doctor. Do you hear? I am. - What happens? Are not you well? - Yes, very well. I only dreamed of you tonight and wanted hear your voice. Do you really call me for that? Yes, I wanted to hear your voice, that's all. If you want to talk about it... ...you can only do it with me. Some days I have almost afraid to forget him. - Do you need me? - No. Decided not to continue watching. If you call me is that I need. Maybe you're right. You know me well. I am still your wife. That we can never erase. - Want to go? - No. Are you sure? You know I love you. Take care. Do you hear that clear? Yes, very clear, thanks. Good morning, doctor. Not find a single woodcock Condiegate on the side. I advise Tralley. On the beach there are hundreds of ducks. Tell had better go before you. A classic French logic. We bring here the virus of doubt. No logic here live well. Going down to the beach Tralley... ...certainty came over me almost painful... ...that Scully we headed there by chance. Surely he knew nothing. But advinaba all. And we poor blind... ...us with a word indicating the precise direction. Scully's intuition was called Anne. Who offered it? I do not feel wanted and desired nothing or life? Or Jerry? How are you? Do not think it's very serious. The heart beats normally. Did they hit the car? No, it has fallen from his horse. Of the horse? How might a thoroughbred? Do not know. I do not care. A thoroughbred is a thoroughbred. - Where is it? - Who? The horse. In Tralley. It is dangerous to let a horse loose. Doctor, not interested in the horse. We want the girl, Anne. - Ah, yes. Anne what else? - Tubelmann. Tubelmann. Is your husband? His father, I suppose. Well, again this afternoon. And go look for the horse. What Tubelmann? In London. Is there no way to reach you? I have no idea. Come on down. Slowly. Come on, pretty. So. I'll catch you need to Anne. In the hospital. It has fallen from his horse. I had not interested me the secrets of others. But that troubled me baroque world and child... ...naive and refined where Anne liked to hide. Anne was a creature that hid... ...with an air of mystery... ...his taste for painting and gluing. That seemed insignificant. But caught my attention. A los Anne liked the same books as me. Eliot... ...Martin Eden by Jack London. I could not help underline a passage... ...and indicate with a sign... ...The silent girl. Fractured clavicle and slight head injury. Is sedated. - Why? - Suffered a concussion. - I asked for the horse and... - Wasting your time. She does not speak. Now I understand. - Have you found the horse? - Yes. We have been thanked with a kiss on the mouth. Really? You had us worried. Jerry wondered if your heart still beating. Marmay have found. Sean takes care of it. I brought I guess some things you need. Say... ...A fall from a horse sometimes not so dangerous... ...As a slip in the snow that can cause death. Alondra light... ...My flight is over. But if you talk. O faithful shadow... ...My song is over. Philippe, speak. It's great. You said these verses. - Right? - Yes... - I see Anne. Stand back. - Need rest. Who has kidnapped? He has not kidnapped anyone. - They take care of her. - I am the only one who care for her. You had gone to London. Here speaks well and serve. Anne talking about? This is a good sign. It replenishes your commotion. You do not know anything at all, ma'am. For three years not said a word. So it's a miracle. I will thank the Lord. 'll Take you home, Anne. I do not trust these orangutans, only I care for you. - Need rest. - Rest at home. Please, Anne, I am. Have you chosen things in my room? Yes. These are the ones I had brought. Well, let's go, I'll take you home. In progress, come on. No. I'm staying. Come see me tomorrow. A Frederick Charles would love this house. I would buy it. - Can you see? - No, Sharon. Over there. I leave. I horrify those mansions. I'm sure... ...That every piece of this house has a story. In the past... ...The house belonged to the Templer, an old family... ...anglorilandesa. They were not bad people. Had one passion, hunting on horseback. Three Centuries of hunting on horseback eventually make a family. Within thirty years, the largest of the Templer... ...Had always been men... ...Began to undergo a metamorphosis. The tusks will grow. His mouth softened. His eyes dwarfed. The... ...stretched his ears and was covered with hair. While her speech seemed increasingly barking. But it was a happy family... ...Which had been three hundred years... ...No harm to them enough. And so it went... ...Until the First World War. The old Duke Templer... ...Died at the age of eighty. His son Edward... ...Was decorated in Ivres because... ...Dragged the assault on his company with their strange cries. Died... ...When a grenade exploded. And for the first time... ...The firstborn from the Templer was a woman. Marie Dorothe. This was his room. At the end of the war... ...the pack gathers and directs his upbringing. Then those who were at his alrederor began to notice it... ...Signs of the same metamorphosis. Began to bark. The tare of the Templer... ...Marked the first time by a woman of the family. The effect was startling in it because... ...It was really beautiful. He was thirty years... ...When a young American came to live in County Clare. He was a young attractive and rich. Fell in love with Marie Dorothe it but... ...One day... ...The young man some distance... ...And believed not to be heard... ...You trust a friend saying that she would never marry... ...With a greyhound because he... ...Just liked the fox terrier. Marie Dorothe, whip, struck the young... ...And caught the same night... ...And broke a gun shot... ...All the mirrors in the house. A few weeks later... ...Learned that the American had married... ...And freed their horses and dogs. Sometimes on stormy nights... ...Say they still hear the pack howling in the woods. Then he will. He left the ancestral home of Christopher... ...Your groom. Deaf and dumb. A man so faithful as a dog. One day... ...The waiter ushered into his bedroom... ...And gave him. On all fours. Then he took a revolver. Christopher killed her... ...Like she had killed their dogs... ...When suffering an incurable disease. Those who saw his body lying naked on the floor... ...Ensure that his face was intact... ...And... Had recovered its incomparable beauty. This house can not be restored or sold. It is owned by Christopher. And Christopher... ...Is in a nursing home ever since. Sharon, Philippe, where are you? I'm not Marie Dorothe. You do not scare me. Mrs. Lee is over. Can you take her to the hotel? Yeah, right. I'll go with you. Do not wait, Jerry. Where are you going? To your hotel. Mrs. Lee wants to know the Conemar. Hidden Rain This curtain another world. Did I wrong? At all. Lady Lee, prepare the rooms. I will walk with Mr. Marchal. Do you see that line on the horizon? - I come from there. - No. You come in here. You went there to give just one lap. I expected you here. Now I do not need anything. - How long. - One day, an hour... ...A minute. I chose the temporary and... ...I paired with triviality. Ask me why. Because you're afraid. Are you surprised? I have no twenties. Why did you come here? I mean to Ireland. Do you care? I know. Every night when I sleep... ...I'm not sure wake up the next morning. Yes, as the melodrama. Romantic, but I doubt that is the real reason. What have I done? None. Mrs. Lee do not even see. Do you? You see me? Tonight... ...Perfectly. Will you return? We have no more excuses to delay the inevitable... Why do I always things so difficult? To punish yourself. Punish me for what? Perhaps for being you. For love too often and... ...Not too good. For betraying an old dream. But it is sad. Who knows. I hope this lasts a long time. Me too. Good morning. This afternoon a plane took off from Shannon Airport... If we leave right away, could be with Frederick Charles Christmas Eve. Supper is held by farmers. Iran veterinarian... ...The old doctor's place, the notary... ...Their women organdy dresses. I made a bow that I could lose. I have craving for bows. You never let things end peacefully? Normally no. How long will it take to be ready? I dressed. I'll miss the plane. I also like... ...That these things go fast. I do not. Bad for you. Crossed the border. I will always remember what we behind this curtain of rain. Can not age is never the other side? It is possible that a forget that you can grow old. 're Bitter. That is disgusting. Take this. Why not? I do not accept... ...Unless you tell me why I give it. Because it has been fine. Why stop? I'll kiss you. - Of course. - Bye. - Philippe. - Good morning, doctor. - Merry Christmas, dear Philippe. - Merry Christmas. Where will the 'Reveillon'? Like everyone else, family. - Had no idea that family. - Patients are my family. Do you know the latest? Anne is no longer in the hospital. Yes, I know. On this very night dinner at Donmoiran. Go.

Will open the packages when we all. Well. Where are they? Tubelmann is in the kitchen. He has spent all afternoon preparing dinner Russian. No wonder. Bet he has been head cooking 'Maxime'. Surely. Anne's upstairs dressing. Did they let out of hospital? If not, what would Tubelmann reduced to rubble. Yes, it's yours. I'll get candles. MOROCCO ADVENTURE BY PHILIPPE MARCHAL. I would like to help with anything... ...But I do not understand Russian cuisine. Thank you. Do not come with me? Do you still showing reluctance to talk? Thanks to you I have never spoken. Sometimes the language of signs is not enough. I do not understand segurdo tell me what you want. Do you know?

Do you go with you, Jerry? No Thanks. I'm staying. Well, until tomorrow. I love that scarf. I have long admired. Maybe now we know enough... ...To tell me... ...How the princess behaved in bed. Thank you for this great evening. So you work well? Had passed a few weeks. From Christmas Eve... ...Jerry had one month wandered through the woods. And now was hunting alone for the whole region. Lonely My life passed. Full of sadness. Unconsciously more than once... ...I went to the marshes... ...where it had never gone with Jerry and where I knew... ...Did not find it. Hoped to be happy. I had only to be free. There were times when I seemed to hear a voice... ...that arose within me like a stranger omen. There was a moment... ...that I was tempted to get carried away... ...to the bottom of a delicious vertigo. Tina. Tina. Good morning, doctor. To think that some people say... ...It always rains in Ireland... Where did you find me? Here, my friend. Back on his feet. I do not remember anything. It seems that you... ...In all circumstances so sure of himself... ...Had resigned himself nobly. And then... ...Terrribles felt a desire to live. Breakfast is ready. I forgot.

I've contributed... ...my three hundred pounds to wipe away their debts. I do not care much. Even... ...gladly have given it is a very friendly debauchery. But I steal them, frankly, I find it insulting. - I had no game. - It traps. Tubelmann cheating. Do has not seen his dealings with Anne? She passed behind us. And serving drinks, watching our can'tas... ...And managed to his knowledge. It was very clear. - Have not you seen any of that? - Yes. I've seen. What is it funny? No, course not.

Do not know what gives me pleasure to hear them. - Are you coming? - Yes... - ...bye. - Goodbye. He has learned a lot tonight. It's true. My friend, I wonder to see... ...How women always immerse you in a state of innocence. What you find it marvelous? Philippe, I have to tell you something. Sharon is back. I know. These two punks of the pub told me. Are you angry? Angered by what? Normally not you call punks. Yes it's true. Sharon always knows what he wants... ...But never making it missing or what is best. Tubelmann I have talked about. She does not like. But is able to sleep with him... ...To see if there really such. I have a feeling you want to tell me something... ...And you do not know how. No. Yes. I'm in love with Anne. I want to marry her and live here. And why not? What's stopping you? Nothing but need the help of my sister. I would take the money from my father. Sharon is the only one he does not know refuse him anything. Are you the one who has brought back your sister, right? Sometimes I get to hate it, but I love her. When we parted... ...I feel miserable. - But when we met... - You need it, Jerry. Yes I think so. Look... I know this is not my business... ...And perhaps should not tell... ...But not get too attached to her. Do you think it is okay to you get attached to Anne? Why did you say? For nothing. What Tubelmann know you want to marry your daughter? Yes, she has said. How did he react? Anne always wanted to engage in horse breeding... ...And he wants montarle a stable for stallions. And for that business who bring the money? Guess. He says that Anne would and freer because of me. How original. Philippe... ...Tubelmann cree that you were a child... ...Who died in an accident. Tubelmann talk too much. Surprise, surprise. It's me. In a case like this, you would have to say: 'How, you here?'. What, you here? - I got up early a lot. - Magnificent. - Where is Mrs. Collin. - Do not know. When I told him to come make an unannounced visit... ...Blushed like a girl to amazing in the shower. Said he did not want to disturb... ...And left. What a horror. Good to see you. Me too. What if we got married? That's not possible. I want to another. Anne Tubelmann do? No. A Margaret Colin. A cup of tea, Mrs. Collin? Princess, we were eager for visiting. I love seeing her again among us. Hello, Jerry. - Morning. - Good morning, Jerry. - This is the plane. - Magnificent. There will stables and artificial turf. Only need to go to a lawyer to form the company. This sliding door is my idea. - Usually seen in America. - What about Anne? Has gone to his room. Resting. I will not very long. Hi. You know it's very difficult to see you alone? I mean, without your father. I guess you want to know if I really Jerry. I do not care. Jerry and I love you enough. I think... Yeah? I think I love Jerry. Well, the better. Let's go down. - Lie ahead. - Down with you. I will soon. Back. It is extraordinary. - Princess, how much honor. - Good night, folks. - And I'm not your prince? - Enough Tubelmann. Do not be ordinary. - Serve a drink around the world. - Will cost fifteen pounds. Okay, but serve first. Before you pay. Lord Derby winner, learn... ...I am not a cheater. You have to understand Mr. Lynch. Sell whiskey. Sells his daughter. What do you mean? Leave it to me, Mr. Marchal. - Drinks for everyone. - Money. It only has the money to you, bartender disgusting. Do you have hurt? It is better that we leave. - Are you all right? - No. This disgusts me. Hello, Tony. Good evening, need help? No, all is well. Thank you. - What if we atizamos a drink? - Yes, a drink. A big gulp. Thank Tubelmann. So I got rid of those dirty English. These are gentlemen who do not drink. All right, doctor. Let me see that. Not important. I'll take care of his wound. - I feel good, leave. - If you insist. Yes. Take a drink. I drink all over the world. And look what a surprise, Lynch. - I'll pay. - No, if it was to laugh. Music. What an idiot I am. I get into what I do not care. Jerry has found a family. Do you think sleeping with Anne? - I know nothing. - I do not know and yes. Sad disappointment. He was not the first. Do not want to talk about this? But is life, dear. To be perfectly honest... ...I think you miss Anne. - No. - Lying. Suppose I drive a little less Tubelmann. What you have to do is sleep. Come. Do not hate me? Yes. I always thought that true friendship between a man and a woman... ...Was possible only if, after having made love... Chose to give each other... ...Forever. Forever? Acknowledge that may be exceptions. Sorry to insist, but I need to see Mr. Marchal... ...To tell what happened. Philippe, come right away. - What. - Anne... ...Has attempted suicide. In the hospital and asked for you. We're waiting, Mr. Marchal. She not see anyone but you. Mr. Tubelmann has had an altercation with a nurse... That prevented him from entering the room. The young Mr. Keen wanted to intervene and... ...Has been beaten the poor. Are you injured? No, thank God. Mr. Keen not want to leave the hospital. Prefers to wait in the lobby. Police have said they will not free Mr. Tubelmann... ...If someone does not takes care of his bail. Could pay his bail... ...But there may be better to let a couple of days... ...to calm down. Yes, I think he's right. Philippe is you who want to see. So until then. Pass. Why did you do that? Do not know. Could not do otherwise. Why did you make me come? Because of Jerry. Do you feel remorse have prepared a trap? Yes. Well tell. Could not. - You tell him. - No. I do not believe it. He loves you. What do you want to tell you help Tubelmann to cheat in the game? Have you noticed? Your father is a cheat. I do not even know if my father. He only lives for me. How so? It may be your daughter... ...Or the daughter of his brother. They have not ever known. But what about your mother? She was the wife of one... ...And mistress of the other. She was an artist. I did not care about those details. When did you discover all that? Three years ago. And since you stopped talking? I stopped talking since I made love with him. Anne... ...To leave a man... - ...Not enough to have found another. - I know. Want to keep the love of Jerry. Yes, now. Well, go with him right away. Iros to Paris or to London. And you help us? Yes. I will try. Tubelmann These stories he tells... ...Is it true that I met in Morocco? No. Read in an article in National Geographic. What is certain is he was in Morocco. - And in New York? - Was in New York. And what about Aunt Olivia? What Frederick Charles? Philippe Marchal What? Philippe Marchal What? If you run away with Jerry... ...And ever... ...Meet again. If I told you... ...We met in Ireland... ...Do you remember? Yes. Of course I remember. Anne awaits. If you really want... ...There is an airport in Shannon. I thought you did not care about me. I know. Sean. Where is Anne? Good morning, boss. - Has been good to the police? - Where is Anne? It's gone. - What? - He's gone. Do you laugh at me? Anne is gone. - When? - This morning. Where did she go? How would I know? This is a joke. You want to play a joke to celebrate my return. - Do you know where Anne, Doctor? - No. I cabree more, Scully. I have enough problems. - Sure you know where. - No, Tubelmann. You are the pigs, yes pigs. Everything was going perfectly. We lacked nothing to be happy and... Gone with that rascal Jerry. But money does not give that right. I shit on the millions of his father. He has cars, yachts. The rich only have a right, the hide. The money has the same dignity of toilet paper. And here nothing has changed. Home, sweet home. What they want to take, gentlemen, vodka? ...And you can not take a drink. Gentlemen, I raise my glass empty the health of mine. Whatever they are and wherever they are. A moment of negligence and all lost. I have fifty years of bad luck, misery. The life and death. Others may not care. Like that girl with my young daughter. I can destroy in an instant... ...The work of a lifetime. Vandals confess I've always liked. Seven years of misfortune. Seven years. I've had fifty-five years of bad luck. It's over the suffering. Off. Leave me alone. Enough is enough. I'm going to throw everything out the window. I do not know why... ...But I pity you, Tubelmann. Does not have to feel sorry. Go, is compassion for the poor. I am rich. I have no money but am rich. How do you want to tell you? I am the richest man in the world. Three days ago I'm here and still have not seen... We have not seen at all. I'm sorry. What I feel inside me. Really? Do not use that tone with me, please. Do not you want to know why I'm back? You are here to help your brother to marry Anne. Tubelmann. Just need money. - He could send it. - Good. Then you've come to make sure that she loves Jerry. That's not a hoax. It's a hoax, Philippe. She does not want. But Jerry it themselves and must come to the end. You say you have not become to help your brother? Do not strain, do not understand. Do... ...Try to make me understand you love me? Please do not envanezcas. I just love myself. Then? Maybe behind the curtain of rain... Life has come where nobody expected. Let's go, I have nothing more to say. Sorry, but you said a lot and yet very little. Is a child, my dear. A child that is within me. I should let you know. It will be a Hanover disrupt family genetics... ...But I want that child. The doctors said I could not have children. That is not the issue. - Me who has to decide. - No. I will never have more children, Sharon. Why? I had one. And he died. I'm sorry, really, Philippe. - I confess I do not know what to say. - So... ...Do not say anything. I arrived here in the suit... ...A shotgun, a pair of boots and... ...In six months I have accumulated a lot of memories... ...and useless things. Although science has made great strides... ...Has not yet invented the man not carrying luggage. - Also the music? - This music itself. Anyway... ...Is you becoming a new man. Young, strong and full of health. So... Stop projecting on others the shadow of what it can not bury. I never have spoken you my son. Actually always talked about it. Who are you to tell others what you can support? Fate, who else? Do you? This is a hobby. Mr. Tubelmann... ...has destroyed everything I had in Donmoiran. You have done well. It was all very ugly. Four days ago has not left home. Passed to the mail under the door. Do not believe that they are bills. There seems to fire, look. Is in Donmoiran. You can see the flames through the forest. Tubelmann may be trapped. No, I bet not. Who would collect the insurance compensation... Dear Margaret, we will see that. Pass me the other line. Help me out the horses. Hurry. Bring water. Come on, come on. Magnificent is not it? It's the apocalypse. The end of the world. You're crazy, Tubelmann. It all started with the fire... ...And all end with the fire. Even beauty. No right to do this. What is it? Why this has made the horses? I do not mind the horses. - I burn. - He's crazy. Be careful what you do... ...Sean. I'm going. Now it goes. Well, go. Is sentimental like a woman. - Anne. - I could not. I could not leave. It is love. Is that what you call love? Never know anything either him or her. Where now take their lives hell? Hello. - I will not go home. - Hello. You kind enough to come to say goodbye. Goodbye? We're within an hour. - Jerry and I to Germany to New York. - That do not even dream. This time it is I who decides. You're wrong, honey. The family has decided to return to North America... ...And come back to America. - I decide where to go and when. - What happened? What our little Jerry this time he has gone too far. Jerry. The only thing that has happened... ...Is that no longer exists the little Jerry. Do you understand? Is it clear? What has happened? Actually, nothing. There will be no miracle child. Frederick Charles will leave his castle to his relatives. No more prince. Well I'm sorry. Do not comfort you to know? No. - What will you do? - The usual. What used to be. It's what I'm made. What? You know very well. A temporal. A frivolous. Pity. This time he had believed that you... Bye, Philippe. Goodbye, Sharon. You speak. I was going to leave Ireland forever. Had decided to return to my old life. Other responsibilities. Afraid that Jerry felt miserable... ...having lost to Anne. But be consoled with inexperience... ...and the liveliness of youth. Had his whole life ahead. Do you think I hide to stay? No, quite the contrary. Your roots are here. Here you personality. Can I sit here at my house. You're right. Breeding horses... ...Is an excellent decision. It's a start. Well, doctor... ...Maybe we meet again in latter trade. That can not be said. Now good health, Philippe. Watch. And I do not send postcards. Dear Friend... ...Goodbye. Good luck. Jerry... ...I disagree with those who consider this country... ...That is mine and yours... ...Like an elephant graveyard. What do you mean? Say that when an elephant comes feels that his last hour... ...Away from his own... ...Goes into the jungle and seeks the path of the cemetery. Only animal about which end is the way. But man... Proposed to go before his death... ...Is lost in the meanders... ...Like a huge maze. A man... ...Ireland with his big heart... ...Know... always offer... ...Its fascinating scenery. - You do me a favor? - Absolutely. I'm so tired of driving. I can ask you leading? Of course. Doctor, will be my pleasure and honor. Thank you, Jerry.
