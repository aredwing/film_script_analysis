You: daughter is lovely. She will take good care of him. MI. Kapoor, it's true... behind every successful there has to be a woman. The two of us are living proof of that! Today he is VP, tomorrow he will be President... then CEO, Chairman. How can a man work fol 16-1101115 a day... without a good support system? My daughter-in-law will 5011 out this fool's life. Thank you! Hey Kia. What axe you Going hem'? Go enjoy yourself. Hello? Hello? Hello? How can I enjoy myself? My best friend is dying! Today her happiness, dreams, identity, independence... Basically it's her last day of being alive. From tomorrow she will be a support... Like a pillar... Ya, ya pillar. Sure, that's important too. But the world will always say... Wow! What a building! Who talks about the poor pillar'? No, no I like marriage. It's a nice concept. But Why should I spend my life with someone who after 40 years will look into my eyes and say... Thank you fol being my pillar! Enjoy, enjoy. You ok? Sorry! Sorry! You Want something? Ma! I Want my mom! Yes Minn'!? Can you get this gentleman... - his Ma? - Excuse me? Mom? Kabir. Kia. Mom... would hold my hand really tight during take off & landing... Like this... She was very scared of flying. Was? It's been 10 years since she passed away. Today is her birthday... That's Why... something happened, something flashed, something crashed... and you received this gift. What gift? The gift of seeing a boy cry live in flout of a gill. You're happy light... - that your mom was horn? Then why cry on her birthday'? Celebrate! Happy birthday Aunty! Dad's alive right? Ya. Are you sad that he is'? No... he's OK. Mama's boy! Mama's boy does not like his Daddy? It's not that. It's tough... to like MI. Bhansal is tough. My dad is Kumar Bansal Bansal? The builder'? I'm already liking you! You're the son of the man who owns half of Delhi! The most expensive scotch! Double, on the locks please! This is the problem with low cost airlines. You can't tell the rich from the poor. Everyone travels economy. So'? MI. Kabir Bansal... You were in Chandigarh to buy Chandigarh'? No. My friend had a break-up... I was there for rnoral support. Cheers! To you: friend's freedom. So... Having issues with dad? You Want to transform his business with your new ideas... but he's not agreeing. Corn-wt? He Wants to show you he's still the boss. The usual problem with big business families. First produce a son to takeover the business. When the son is ready to takeover, the father is not ready to handover! The usual "father-son" friction I totally get it I have no interest in my dad's business. What? And before you order another double on the rocks... I Want to share a big truth with you. What? This expensive scotch of yours... I can't afford it. Are you Kumar Bausal's stepson? No, the one & only son. But if I have no interest in dad's business, to have interest in his money... not cool, right? So What do you do than? Why? Do I have to do something? Yes of course! Why do you need to do anything? Whether you are interested in dad's money... or not... after he's gone R's all yams anyway. - What do you do? - I work at Marion. What do you do there'? I'm a Marketing Manager. What plans after that? After that, in a couple of years I'll be Vice President. After that? I will he CEO. WOW! With such clarity... every dream comes true. - We should have a dream in life. - Correct! OI of coulee... a dad! Yes, I have a dad. But even I have a dream. - Don't tell me! - Okay I Won't tell you. Okay tell! Because actually I really want to know... When someone has everything... What would his dream he? Tell... I Want to he like my mom. Excuse me? I... want to be like my mother. My Plume! When-is my phone? Give me your number. I just called to say I am not a "She", I am a "He". What? I'm not gay. I don't Want to change my sex... I hate pink... I like Women. I like Whiskey. You hid my phone so you could get my number, right? Cheap whiskey tomorrow night'? Can I he honest? I did find you a hit Weird. So why did you come to meet a weirdo'? Just like the hook at the end of a TV episode... which compels you to Watch the next episode 0111 meeting also ended somewhat like that "I Want to he like my mom!" And than? And than? And than? And than? So just curiosity. If it's not a problem to he like your dad, then What's the problem with being like your mom? They both produced Inc... Haven't ever heard a man say... that he Wants to he like his Mommy. Didn't Rajiv become like Indira Gandhi'? Doesn't Rahul Want to he like Sonia? Who was your mom? Which country was she the PM of! She was an artist... Was she a singer, dancer, sculptor... Housewife. - What? - She was a housewife. And than? And than? And than? And than? Today's episode... same time, same place? The shock has given me severe acidity... Can't drink tonight. Ma' am. What's this? Dont know. Came by courier. Dig one'? Gelusil? It's not the alcohol... it's the curiosity that's causing the acidity. Housewives are the world's greatest artists. - What's there to be curious'? - It's not that... I'm just curious to know why an INM(B) topper, instead of taking his dad's business forward... dreams to he a housewife like his mom? How do you know I'm from INM(B)'? Facebook. It's a small world you know. But my Facebook page hasn't been active for ages. I saw you: picture on a Facebook friend's page. Who? - Neha. - Dhupia? Dholakia. Forget about yesterday... Yesterday is old news... I didn't see any suggestive pictures. It was tagged, "Me and my genius topper friend". So I assumed you guys were batch mates. But now I'm 011110115... Before more curiousity gives you more acidity... Eat! How do you know I like this pasta? You: tresses, long and thick like spaghetti... Eyes, black like olives... actually, eyes not so black... Nose pointed like baby corn. Cheeks flushed like cherry tomatoes. Lips made of sliced bell pepper. A spicy tongue like jalapeo. You are a full on pasta dish. You're not going to eat stuffed Indian bread. Wow Kabir! I'm floored. No one has ever seen me as a vegetable shop! So romantic. How can anyone be romantic with you'? You Want to arrive fast... eat fast, talk fast, listen fast... move ahead fast... Romance... happens in slow motion. Now did you feel something? Neha... But somethings fishy. The pasta's veg, how can it be fishy'? If you didn't Want to he in business, Why do an MBA? Before being against something... one should understand it fully. Why are you so against business? What is business? A man has a dream... To fulfill it he starts a company. He employs people to run the company... and gives them all a dream of "moving ahead". Working day and night, "moving ahead", earning millions, they become blind... and can't even see that their dreams Were fulfilled long ago. Instead of enjoying the fruits of their labour, they keep "moving ahead" like zombies! Acidity, stress, heart problems... Finally they end up in an expensive private hospital and say... "Thank God! I can afford World-class medical treatment." What? I'm serious! This mantra of moving ahead is the most dangerous. Who are you moving ahead of! Where are you going'? Why are you going'? In the housewife sector, there's no "moving ahead" madness. There's no ranking in this industry. So no insecurity, no acidity only happiness. Oh great Saint Kabir. You're full of shit. Your goal is to avoid hard work all your life I've never heard such a rubbish philosophy in my life. Why? If someone like your dad does not dream of "moving ahead"... then how do you become a housewife and sit at home like your mom? Mom didn't sit at home I'm really sorry. I didn't mean it like that. How did you mean it than? What did you mean? Without a visiting card or designation... a person has no value? Is making a home lesser than any profession? It's the biggest bloody art in the World... The art of having no dreams fol yourself. The art of being happy for others. The art of happily sacrificing your identity. Do you know What is Mrs.. Bansal's actual name? She was a pillar for my big builder dad. A building falls without support. Just because she was not famous or making millions... she "sat at home and did nothing"? She was creating a home. My mother was an artist... A great artist. And like every great artist... she was also very sensitive. She died early because... just like you, one day my father told her... "What do you do except sit at home!" My goal is not to avoid hard work. But I work hard to avoid useless goals. Hey I'm sorry... I'm really sorry. I didn't mean it like that. Hello? Sorry man! What do you Want me to do? Come on now Kabir. Aren't you a topper? Please forgive lesser mortals. Enough Kabir. Even you: morn wouldn't approve of such behaviour towards a gill Sunday tomorrow. What are you doing'? I have work in office. - Take the day off. - It's tough. Means you're not sorry. Hey, this is so cool! Shit man! This is the solution to global Warming! Why do people buy cats? Actually maybe fol Women not so good. Then-is a lot you don't know. Yes... Can't tell from that beard that you're a kid! Your (one does not sound like you are sorry. No, no... There's a child in everyone, so it's cool. You don't Want to go on the toy train? It's for ages under 12. I love trains. Vintage steam engines, mini locomotives. Many late models are here. Even I have... a full train set! The world is into space travel. And you're stuck in steam engines'? The romance of trains... You Won't get it. You're a robot! Corporate robot. Your hardware has no soft feelings. You're a corporate psychopath. If it were up to you, you'd kill all office-goers. There is softness. Touch and see. Just stone. Did your mom and dad feed you granite? Not mom & dad. Just mom I was Z when I lost my dad in an accident. He died very young. So only mom after that. She married fast, had a baby fast became single fast. So now you know Why I am "fist-fast". Hereditary problem I'm so sorry. Happens. After dad died mom made herself busy. She became the queen of social work. Today she runs a few NGOs I've always missed having a home and a perfect family. I had some softness too... But now this is me. Are you single? Why, do I look double to you? Don't you have a boyfriend? On and off... But no one permanent. - You scare them away? - Boys are chicken. They can't handle a woman more ambitious than them. So you're going to die single? In an expensive hospital. But Why are you so curious? Why? Do you hold the copyright to he curious? OK ask me. - When is you: birthday'? - 15th April. What are you saying? Mine too! 15th April!! - What'? Don't lie. - Here look, my I.D. You think we are twins separated at birth? 1988! And you? Where are you: manners'? Never ask a woman her year of birth! Did you see the 1983 World Cup, when India won'? No. I Wasn't horn then. And the 1987 World Cup'? When Australia won'? - No. I was too young. - That means you are '84 horn - '85 - You said it, I didn't ask! Do you like kids? Yes. But other's. Don't kids slit your maternal instincts? There are so many kids around. Why produce one more'? Afraid'? Kids and marriage will hijack your flight to success? The idea of marriage is good. It's nice to have someone. To talk to... like a special friend... who you can cuddle and sleep with! Your own private happy space. But a Woman pays too heavy a price in marriage. No offense to you: morn, but the responsibility of a happy home, is always forced onto the woman. However evolved a man is... a woman's career somewhere gets compromised. Marriage is not fol me. Why? So many Women manage both Well. They're super, super women. So aren't you a super, super, super woman? Not at all. So marry me then! If you Want to slap me, then on this cheek please... I have dental problems this side. The doctor said I have to extract my wisdom tooth. "You're too wise!" Now Who's fist-fast? Slow down! Why should I he the scapegoat fol you to he a housewife? Scapegoat? You Want to move ahead fast, I don't Want to move ahead at all. You Want marriage but you don't Want the domestic hassles I Want marriage too... but don't want the office, career, ambition hassles. Even out birthdays are the same. OK I'm three years younger, but big deal! We are 100% made for each other. Unless of coulee you're chicken... And can't handle a man without ambition I'm not in love with you. Neither am I. If you're not in love then why do you want to marry'? We should get married first... If we fall in love before... what will we do after marriage'? You're breathing is heavy... You're breaking into a sweat... You're body is trembling... You're not in love'? With my one touch... your heart was pounding... You couldn't speak a Wold... Skipped work to hang with an aimless dude and... eat greasy food... You're not in love'? Foolish love... Foolish love. This love of mus. Foolish love... Foolish love. All topsy-turvy... - Is there a dog in the house? Sorry about the mess! - Hi. - Hi! Mom, Kabir Kabir, mom. Hi Kabir. You are her mom? Are you married? Say the wold We can change plans and slope right away! You only hit on women older than you'? Excuse me? Where are the older women'? How old are you mister? Mom We share the same birthday. But he's 1988. So he's hitting on you. No lines. Full circle. Crazy guy Wants to marry me! Kabir! Why do you Want to commit suicide? Be single, he happy... Do something with your life. Life is too short. Why Waste it being someone's husband? Actually mom, not husband... he Wants to he my Wife. What? Interesting... Meaning you will eat fol flee? You Women think like men... and then call us chauvinists! If Kia was your son... and brought home a gill who Wants to marry and he a housewife... Would you ask that gill the same question? Point! But I would ask the same question even then. My daughter truly loves you. Wow mom! - You're Sherlock Holmes. - You're not getting it! What I mean is, when Women fall in love... foolish men think We love only them. But we love them, their job, their position... financial security... We love the Whole package deal. But there is nothing to love ab out you... except yourself! You Won't even take your dad's money. Which means she really loves you for you. Which means... there must be surely something special about you. Oh, your's praising me! For a second, I was confused! But you're OK with this or not OK with this? Had sex? Important before commitment I'm very excited! Kia April 15th Kabir April 15th. Kia Weds Kabir, also April 15th? Titanic sank April 15th. You will never forget the date! Dad, Kia Kia, dad. Sit it's an honour meeting you. The honour is all mine. It is the first time he is introducing me to a friend. Please sit. What will you drink? No, nothing. I'm fine, thank you. We are getting married. What do you do my dear? - I work at Marion... - Drivel, peon... liftman, Watchman... Anything! First get him a job... then do whatever you Want with him. How will he look after you? Just like mom did. Have you gone mad? You'll live off a Woman? You are a man! If you've forgotten go in, take off you: underwear and check! If you don't want to do anything with you: life then die alone I'm dealing with it... It's my misfortune... Why are you ruining another life'? A woman is a man's responsibility. You should take care of her, protect her, fulfill her every need. When a man becomes a woman's responsibility and stays with her as a househusband... people call him impotent. If you're impotent, quietly stay here. Why are you broadcasting this shame'? MI. Bansal... Today I am truly proud of your son. Despite being horn in this house, he is the Way he is. If he had taken over you: business & made you proud in society, then you would call him a "man"... But fol a Woman... a real man is one... who knows he's a man. Not one who isn't confident of What's inside his underwear... and has to shout from the rooftops... "I'm a man! I'm a man! I'm a man!" Today I consider myself the luckiest woman in the world. Because I have a real man by my side. Wish you would learn something from you: son. One minute... Didn't buy it with my dad's money... It's a gift from my uncle. Underwear check? Who's first? Get serious! We're getting married here! Congrats! Mom's... Happy birthday. Thank you I'll go and reheat the tea. So serious about you: duties from day one'? If I don't impress my wife with my service, she will kick me out! I don't drink tea. Then What do you drink first thing in the morning? Other than single malt. Coffee. Black, white, filter or instant'? I am already very impressed... you relax I'll make it. Black, white, filter or instant'? Black. Filter. Did you clean up? No, I opened the Window, a strong wind blew... - the place got cleaned up! - There is a maid to do all this... - She comes at noon. - No Women allowed in the kitchen. This is my kitchen! Coffee. Thank you! - And you: coffee'? - Tea. Already had two cups. Bathroom done, jogging done, shower done... There! Done praying too. How's the coffee? Nice, nice! Good, good... All members of this household are requested... to always speak the truth to each other. This maintains peace and happiness at home. Too much milk! Too bitter! Good. Feedback leads to improvement I'm a tea drinker. It's the first time I'm making coffee. How could you hide such a big truth from me? If I knew you didn't know how to make coffee... I would have never agreed to this relationship. Mom, We have been cheated! Please forgive me. It will never happen again! Breakfast? Ornelette, scrambled, half-fry, French toast? We don't have breakfast. Just coffee. Which is Why you get acidity. Ornelette, scrambled, half-fry, French toast... Gelucil or Digene'? Stuffed potato parantha, hot, flied puris... can't you make?

How do We explain 0111 work to Women? Same problem... How do We explain 0111 work to men? Come over! Brother, I thought you were at work! I am at work.

Kia What's happened? Kia! We'll have to sell the house! We just bought it! Some problem at work? I'm finished! I'm finished! Everything's over. My dreams, my plans... my life... Everything's over! My career is over! I don't want to live anymore! What has happened? I'm pregnant. It's all your fault! - What did I do? - Who did than? You should have been careful! I'm always careful! Useless! - Chill Kia. - What chill? It's not you: problem. The baby is in my stomach! My life is getting over! - Calm down! We'll handle this... - Handle? What will you handle? Because you've earned some money, you can handle anything? Why should your Wife have any dreams? Get her pregnant and make her sit at home! A man's ultimate revenge! - Took your revenge? - Shut up Kia! Bloody useless! Get lost! Kia... What is it? Pregnancy tests are not 100% accurate... How accurate are they'? 99% Ass! Kia hear me out! Let's try a few brands. If we Sorry... If we pass, then we'll go to the hospital and get properly tested. If you're definitely pregnant we'll get an abortion done. You'll have the abortion? Is the baby in you: stomach? Sorry! Sorry! Take this. What's this? All different brands... Let's test with all. So many? Are you mad? Best of five... Positive! 1-0: 2-0! I've already done one! Chill! Chill! Next... There's some problem... - It's showing negative. - This is the right one! Yes! I knew it... You're not pregnant! This is the right one. - This is also negative. - Z-Z! Yes! I knew it! I knew you're not pregnant! Hey Kia! Negative! Negative! 3-2! How can you ever think I'll stop your life? - Now why'? - What if it's 3-3'? 4-2 a Negative! I can't believe this! Whatever the problem... it's not Your's or Mine... it's Ours. We're in this together. Don't take off on me like that... Ever! I'm sorry baby! Then-is a product launch next Week... so I just panicked! Forget that product. If this product had launched... who would pay the monthly installment? My problem is bigger than you: problem! Now come. There's you: favourite beans and rice for dinner. Come on. You marketing guys don't understand. You: emotional ad campaign won't do! The pressure of sales is on me. We need an offer. To boost the sales, Rs. 20 off immediately! You made an offer of Rs. 10 off just 4 months ago! You sales guys will kill the brand! - There will be no brand without buyers... - Sit! This is short term thinking! Rs. 20 off is less. We should give 50% off. What? - But not fol Women. - Meaning? 50% off... if the men come to buy. Kia! You've lost it? Which man buys cooking oil? Maybe in your house... If We tell Women... this offer is only for men... all of them will force their men to go to the stores. Their love for the brand will increase... because thanks to the brand, their lifelong dream is being fulfilled... of getting men to shale the responsibility of running the house. Why should caring fol the health of the family... only be the wife's duty'? Men must share that responsibility too. The house is in his name... so shouldn't he be doing some housework too'? And one mole thing, maybe because of this... your Wife also will start liking you mole! Brilliant! Kia this is a breakthrough idea! The whole Saffola range should have this offer! Kabir... I got promoted to Vice President Marketing! Here he is! From today onwards training... - stops! - What? Take care of you: own bodies. - What do you mean? - Why? Wife's status is rising. Mother-in-laws status is changing. Too many responsibilities now... no time! Don't do this Kabir, you're my life! We had a target of 15 kilos, only 6 has been achieved! We need you Kabir! But I don't need the money! - My god! You can't do this! - Please! But... I Won't take money. - So no then. - OK, OK! - Bye. - Kia Wait! So late! Have you eaten? Too tiled. How was your day? - It's Sunday. - So? Don't you know What Sunday means? Big review meeting tomorrow. I'll have to go to office. Miss it! ' Can't! ' can! Can't! For a woman to make a name in the corporate world at such a young age... is still very rare Kia. It's a big achievement I think it's equally difficult for the men. Come on it's much tougher on us. We have to excel both at the office and at home. I only focus on my work... My husband takes care of the house. Wow! Is he fol real? Wish everyone had a husband like yours I'd really like to meet him! Kia What is this? Why did you give them my number? - It's a small interview. No big deal. - I don't like all this! Why are We doing this? I will benefit. Your interview will give me mole publicity. OK bye now I have to go! Kabir thank you fol letting us into your life. You have a beautiful home! - Thank you. - When did you decide... that you would take care of the house full time '.7. The first time I came to this house and saw it's condition... I decided that the "men" in this house needed a "Woman". So can we say that in you: relationship, Kia is the man'? No... Kia is a Woman, and I am a but I understand you: confusion. Homemaker means you're a "she", having a career means you're a "he"... According to "Indian tradition". True, hut Kia is a very successful Woman & you are dependent on her financially... Does you: ego ever hurt'? Do you feel jealous? So you're saying that... all those women who are homemakers are jealous of their husband's success? Using their money to run the house hurts their ego'? If Women don't feel it, Why do you think men will feel... jealous... have an ego? Maybe men's upbringing, genetic difference... Of course. We are different... Which is why I don't wear a bra & she doesn't have a beard. But genes don't say that a bra can't go to work... or that a beard can't run the house. My "she" is proving to the world... that she's no less than a "he"... And this "he" is proving to the world... that he's no less than a "she"! The Constitution of India gives every citizen the freedom of choice. She and he have the freedom to choose what they want to do. We chose this life. Why is it breaking news to you'? Kia! I saw your husband's "He-She" interview... Damn cool! What a dude your husband is! For a minute even I was influenced by his words! You're a very lucky gill! You: husband is a very progressive man. Yes. All companies should recruit more women I wish more of out men were like him. He's from INM(B), right'? Kia, your husband's trending! Let's get hack to work guys. Hi Ma'am... I saw your interview... - Thank you! - I loved What you Were Wearing! You've become an overnight stat! Saw the interview? I gave you so much publicity! Me? You Were praising yourself! Anyway you looked hot! It was a question of your reputation! I did the make-up and lighting myself. What did you mean "condition of the house" before you came? Did we live in the gutter before'? That was a joke... A true joke. And What was that... "She" is proving to the world that she's no less than a "he"... That was a compliment! What do you think? That my life's is to show people that I'm no less than a man? I'm not proving anything to anyone, OK? I just Want to he the best at What I do. She finds faults even in compliments! You said something? I saw your son on T.V. But Women's Day is next month... What was he doing on T.V.'.7. Sit, he speaks very Well. - Did he say anything about me? - No sit... He didn't even take your name. Thank God... else 0111 apartment prices would fall! - Hello? - Hi, is this MI. Kabir Bansal? Yes, speaking. Sit We would like you to talk in 0111 Ted X Program. - What is this? I'm starving! - Sorry! What will you have? Just order anything! Hello? Sit, we're doing a cookery show... - Don't you think'? - Clutter-breaking idea, sit! Sit I know it's very interesting... but I don't think he'll do it. Television is going to die. Who will Watch T.V. with so many ads? They should ban ads! When-is mom? Some NGO seminar or something. Drink? You Won't believe it... my boss Wants to cast you in an ad. Excuse me? Don't Worry... I said no. Which ad? Saffola! Saffola? Saffola... Actually Kia it's a good idea. You: last "offer" idea for men was such a hit... Actually... it's a great idea! How long will we stereotype women in ads'? Ads influence society, right? Change ads, change society! You'll do an ad? Kia, I Want Kabir to give 0111 Marketing & Sales team... an inspirational talk. Just an informal evening session. He's such an interesting man. I'm sure people will love it! Kabir? Hale'!? You're really enjoying you: new life, aren't you'? I really enjoyed coming to you: office. But how do you work there'? I Wasn't talking about this evening. What do you mean? I mean... all these talks and speeches... At first I found these interviews & talks on gender equality very irritating. But after seeing the initial Response, I started. If I can do some good, then Why not? What good are you doing? By sharing out lives... if someone else's life gets better, then why not'? I thought I was the marketing person, and you didn't like marketing... You are marketing your life! 0111 life! Not my life. My life is not so different. So many women work... You're the different animal! And anyway who are you helping? You think that centuries of injustice done to Women... can he wiped clean in a second by your example? It's the men, not the Women who are benefiting from this. Inspired by you, men think they can sit at home & become stats! If you don't want to work... why encourage others to be useless. That you find happiness in my happiness. Is not necessary in love... If 0111 paths don't meet... does not mean We are apart... This is love, not duty... This is love, not duty... This is love, not duty... This is love, not duty... I have some good news. We Want to send you to New Yolk for a management pro gramme. It's a fabulous one month pro gramme. Would you like to go'? Everything OK? Yes sit. I'll go I'm already depressed! How can you both leave me all alone... and go to the U.S. fol a month? Very mean! What alone? I'm not going I'm just joking... What's happened to you Kabir? He's become famous mom... - He doesn't have dates. - What? Everything stops from today. What? Anyway... the country's youth is Watching this useless example... and getting corrupted! What? How can I leave you in this condition? What's happened to me? Anything can happen. Anyway my job is to take care of the house... not to travel the world! I'm sorry... For what? Why Won't you come? What will I come and do there for a month'? You'll he able to stay without me? You'll he busy... Instead of living there without you it's better if I stay here without you. At least I can look after mom. I Want to he useful. Then I Won't go too. Don't go! But I've already accepted... and it's a great opportunity to learn. So go... I didn't mean What I said in the cat I mean What I'm saying now. You do your work, I'll do mine. Anyway you feel that I don't do anything. If I come to America with you and enjoy... even I'll feel that I'm useless! I don't know how to convince you... This is love, not duty... Does not mean I desire you any less. This is love, not duty... Times have changed a hit, But I'm the same, my love... How do I make you understand I don't know how to make you happy But I Want to see a smile on your face. This is love, not duty... This is love, not duty... This is love, not duty... This is love, not duty... That you find happiness in my happiness. Is not necessary in love... That you find happiness in my happiness. Is not necessary in love... If 0111 paths don't meet... does not mean We are apart... Where are you going all dressed up like a stud? To focus on my present life... I had made my past out of focus... But now my past is calling out to me. After many years then-is a reunion of all the MBA robots. Shall I go? If you come home early sleep outside! So you learned how to cook? Yes, completely! - Hi Kabir! - Hi Neha. - How's Kia? - She's good. Very good. When Z people have a scene in college... and they lose touch... and meet after many years... that moment guys... is pule sex! Here! Sex done'? - What are you drinking? - I Want to get drunk! I Want to have shots! Kabir... You gave me a big complex in college... Now that I'm Worth 400 million dollars, and single... you still make me feel like a loser! What did I do? You're the one who is in every Woman's dream even after marriage! You've become a film director but still didn't bring an actress along. Your life is no less than a film. How much fol the copyrights? - Kahit? - Yes? Will you come to Mumbai fol me? Why is your husband in Delhi? No in Paris. Ass! My channel is doing a big pro gramme for Women's Day... I stopped doing all that... Please do it fol me? Just one day! Please? How many times can I say the same thing? Anyway it's Women's Day... Women should speak fol the benefit of Women to Women! For Women to benefit men should speak to men. No, you find yourself another man I've committed... I'll he badly screwed! Just one day... Please! Please! Please! (Kabir: History says, in the stone ages men hunted and Women in caves cooked...) No one checked how many men cooked... and how many Women hunted! If you miss 1 match out of 121 it Won't make any difference... Today's Women's Day, sit with your Woman and listen to this boy! If we reversed the roles, then what? The Woman's job would he hunting... the man's job, cooking! Only their responsibilities would have been swapped. Men would have Remained men... Women would have Remained Women... Sex would have been just as good! Yes, but today We... would not be celebrating Women's Day... but Men's Day instead! History must have been written by a man! His-tory... The clue is in the wold itself, His Story! Does anyone know Her Story? - Who's this fellow? - He's a man! I can see that. The men who discovered the Hindi language knew this about this mistake... In Hindi grammar, "cooking" is a masculine gender... So cooking is male territory. "Working" is a feminine gender... Female territory! Fact is... we ale speaking one language, and living another. He takes care of his home so his Wife can fulfill? her dreams. Good! Good? Could you have ever done this? Yes, Why not? Rubbish! If I had continued my acting work... would you have taken care of the house? Absolutely. If that was your dream. You can't boil a glass of water on you: own! We would have got a cook. Does he have kids? - That's not the point! - That's the point... That's the big point Jaya! When did I stop you from Working? It was your choice! Exactly. It was my choice because I had no other choice! What are you saying! I would have happily looked after the house! sure! Amitahh Bachchan cooking in the kitchen... and Jaya Bachchan happily Waving to her fans every Sunday! You would have been OK with it? Yeah. Why not? So easy to say it. Can't rewind life! What do I do? What do you Want me to do? - I Want to meet this boy. - Who? This guy? - Yeah. - Why? I like him. Just look at him! At this age a new threat! Hi. You coming? Corning where? So Why did you call? I just called to say... I called to say I'm meeting Amitahh Bachchan & Jaya Bachchan! What? I'm in Mumbai. What are you doing in Mumbai? Then-is a Women's Day seminar...

This is fol Kia. Thank you! What wrong did I do to you'? I'll have to heat her lectures fol days! Kia, 20 missed calls? Mom...! What happened? Her BP was very low. She collapsed. She was trying to call you. She called Kia, Kia called me... We had to rush her here. Kia was saying... she'll catch some flight via Zurich and leach by tonight. - Hello? - Where are you'? Kia you've landed... I'm almost there! I'm already in the bloody hospital! Flight arrived early? - Swiss air was supposed to... - I came by Lufthansa. - Why didn't you call me? - Call you? The whole world was trying to call you! Why did you come hack? Go give mole speeches! Nothings happened. Mom is flue. You didn't have to leave work & rush here I came. I'm here! You Were not here! What is this sudden trip to become famous'? Why do you suddenly want to show the world how great you are'? You left home to tell the world how well you run a home'? You're a bloody fraud! This is a hospital. Please go outside. Kia! I Went to meet Amitahh Bachchan... Did mom's blood pressure know that you Were with Amitahh Bachchan? If Amitahh Bachchan knew that my mom was dying... and you Were telling stories of being a "cool husband"... he would have thrown you out! My phone was on silent... there Were no flights out. I took the first... You're living off my money and you want to show the world how great you are'? OI is it that because I'm older than you... you're doing me a favour by living with me. Kia listen... Now that you're on T.V. and a social celebrity... you: "homemaker" & "don't want to move ahead" act is over'? Kia... You don't want to progress! The joke of the century! You are the cheapest, slimiest... most manipulative man in this world. Why are you living off Inc... when you are the heir to millions? Why? Why? Why? You used me! I'm such a fool! It was pule strategy! You plotted this hit by hit! It was all a set-up! Nothing was a coincidence... from the Chandigarh-Delhi flight until now... Was it really you: dead mother's birthday that day'? Brilliant game, brilliant bloody game! You proved that you're an MBA topper. What a business plan! I'll become a hem not by inventing anything... not by becoming yet another millionaire, not by anything. Just... by doing nothing! Without doing anything I will leave my mark in the world.

My home I'll take care of it. Dear Kia... We really missed you. Kabir told us a lot about you I'm truly, truly proud of you. I know the world is celebrating Kabir today... but without a Kia, a Kabir cannot exist. Every Woman Wishes fol a husband like this... but very few have the courage to love such a man. It takes a lot fol a man to he a Kahit... But it takes a lot mole fol a Woman to he happy... with a man like Kabir. You are a big inspiration! I wish the world would have more women like you, Kia. God bless you! That you find happiness... in my happiness. Is not necessary in love... If 0111 paths don't meet... does not mean We are apart... When-is Kabir? Kia! I'm so cheap mom! I hate myself I.

This is love, not duty... I really didn't mean what I said! I didn't mean what I said morn... Of coulee you meant it. Else you Wouldn't have said it. I didn't mean What I said I really love Kabir! Love is not the problem... There is no problem between Kabir and you. Infant, this is not a husband-Wife, man-Woman... or... What is that... not even a "he-she" problem... This is a basic issue between a homemaker and the person who earns... Whether it's a "she" or a "he"... Unfortunately, the world only sees the person who earns in the relationship because of which the person gets used to the attention. It's natural! No one notices the homemaker... Slowly, even the earning member stops noticing the homemaker. When the world by chance notices the homemaker... then natal-ally, the homemaker feels a bit nice... and the earning member feels a bit shaken. Hey! I'm the hem! How can the supporting actor equal to me! But I'm not like that mom! You are exactly like that! We are all I'.ike that. W eke human beings'.! But you know What is so beautiful about you?

But Why did you come after me so quickly? I can understand if my friend was a "she"... If you: friend was a "she"... this plane Wouldn't have lauded in Chandigarh.
