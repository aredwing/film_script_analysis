It may look rubbish for the experienced director, But for my eyes it looks great This film is the best Because of producers like you, Our cinema industry is on it's downfall Because of directors like you... commenting every movie as rubbish is the reason for it's downfall But I'm not a fool like you I'm a fool to produce your movie Didn't you beg me to make a movie? You keep quiet - Did I knock at your door for a chance? - If talks anymore, you'll get my swears Sir, please let's talk and sort it out Sir, I didn't mean that way Wait for a while, sir He's getting sacred of me How dare him call me a fool Why the hell did you invite me? - Sir... - Shut up Shut the camera!

Let's find a solution to all of this Will you just stop your Kuruvamma story? I've been asking about Sethu all these days - Why do you ask about Sethu? - Why? Did we ever ask why you tell Kuruvamma stories? Why do you ask us then? I can't tell anything about Sethu Take this 100 bucks Close our account We are never coming back here Whoever comes here will enquire about Sethu Even last week, there was someone He tweaked lot of questions about Sethu Didn't know why? Then? Someone said a reporter wanted to write about Sethu Then... He went alone to the fields tied his hands and burnt himself alive What? I said he was burnt alive by Sethu's gang Ruthless killers How did they know about the reporter? I told them They gave me 350 bucks Did you guys ask about Sethu? No...why do we talk about him?

Don't cry Don't cry dude Leave me Karthi Is it the director? You got hurt Are you crying? Don't get upset This is just the beginning Irony in cinema is... To make the audience laugh, the director has to cry It's been 35 years since I started crying What are you looking at? 40 years before, I came to chennai with a passion for cinema 5 years, I still hadn't got a start Then 10 years I worked as an assistant and experienced cinema Everyone gets an opportunity It's like an Angel If you respect it, It comes again and again But if you disrespect it, It will never come back The new directors want to be Sathyajitray on their debut film They wont compromise for a single thing They create problems on every small issue Me too of same category My producer wanted his cousins to be casted in the movie I said no and stood by I said go and walked out stating I will get 1000 more producers But till now I haven't met... ...one among the thousands I will just get hold of people coming to my shop And start telling them stories in the name of Sivanesan and Kuruvamma But they don't exist That's my story Kuruvamma If it would have got released in that period, It would have been a massive hit Should have been like Balachander and Bharathiraja Now I am 64 years old Never Uttered the word 'Action and Cut' Are you scared that you'll end up like me According to you I might have lost, But for me I am successful Your success and failures, shouldn't be determined by others You should know from within The clever pave their own way Go on, do your work I have to open the shop Can't change a thing by crying about it What? Hey I am telling you Hey stop Leave him What do you want? Thought about it I have decided to keep you as a hero Nothing helps like pounding Congratulations!

Pull, pull out your tongue You'll die Do Shringharam Why do you bite your lips? Why do you cry? Cry...feel and cry Others should shed tears looking at your cry How would I make you understand? Come on cry Don't cry, master Cry Sethu...cry Love, is this how you look at a girl with love? Aren't you old enough? Haven't you loved a single girl in your life? Didn't your heart skip a beat ever? Haven't you heard the melodies of Ilayaraja in the air? - I'm a Shankar Ganesh fan - Very important You won't, you will never feel love in your life Karthi... I'm really sorry You left me crying, But you were drunk and dancing I was so furious So I just wanted to get back at you Tease...? You ruined my career Look at this Have you ever touched someone?

Don't Karthik, please Sethu sir She has been waiting so long ...and if everything had happened in time You wouldn't have to take this crap from others is what Kayal feels Could have got married Even so, romance would flood- Karthik, please shut up Karthik, I still love you Try to understand I just came to say it I am not able to forget you Hey Karthi, She desired to see me as an actor Ask her to wait for sometime Once the movie release, immediately will marry her Tell her - Play that song now - Shall I? In my journey of 20 years I have never come across such a bunch of morons But I have trained them to my strength So from this... Oorni, Rasu, Senthil, Kasi, Vettu Kumar you all stand aside Sethu, come over here We all passed the class Sethu don't worry, we'll beg and get you passed somehow This whole lot here, even if they train for eons to come, they can never act Even the others could stand in the atmosphere But this one...? Don't even think of placing him in a corner of a frame Total waste of time Okay, sir You sinner...! This bugger over here ...is the worst actor I have ever come across But, he can act Is there any scenes where he has to cry or romance Both are there That's tough If we could train and beat the shit out of him, may be we can get some performance But other than that you can start the shooting Producer sir, let's rock Sir, first shot Could you please clap, so we can start?

You go, I'll watch from here Okay Come one by one Get in...get in Move...move "In a land of blood and death, called the grand Madurai... among the ruthless killers was born a man called 'A.Kumar' In A.Kumar, A stands for... Azukuni Kumar (Crybaby Kumar) What he does is? He cries for everything ...and tries to become a gangster Who is that Azukuni Kumar? Here comes our sir If you make a gangster film with him, it would be a laughing stock You are acting serious but everyone is laughing In the next scene I'll shoot a guy, You see everyone would be shocked Cry man, cry out loud He made me a fool Roll camera Do it Hey, do it man Listen to me carefully Did you speak this dialogue? What I spoke in that scene was different It's not even my voice They have added it separately Oh, you can add things later to the movie is it? Why are you crying, sir? Awesome, how did you? Awesome, man Everyone in the audience is gonna enjoy every minute of it First he cut the call, Now it's switched off The song was different when we shot, now it is something else I have never seen people laughing so much for a song It seems like a magic It is our fault, not knowing what could be made in cinema Light it and cry Light it...and cry Now light it and cry Hit your head and cry Jump crying from there Come, let's go He ditched us Eating my food, under my roof, with my story, look what he did That's why they never to trust the educated - Great job - Superb - Mom - Movie is very good Tell me, sir Acted like a buffoon feeling ashamed - Tell me, boss - Sethu... Awesome, buddy You made Sethu a joker, the comedy king of the decade - Thank you, sir - I hope your next movie with me Hey I'm flying to Singapore tonight You guys too be safe, don't get caught If we get caught, that's it This movie is breaking genre and trends set here A comedy gangster flick "Azhuguni Kumar" (Crybaby Kumar) How did you get the idea? People are scared of these murderers and killers With a story of such a violent murderer... I wanted to make everyone laugh In fact most of these rowdies will look like a joker up close Just thought of showing that How did you find the lead, looked really funny on screen? We were looking for a guy who looks comical An apt face for Azukuni Kumar, Of the 1000 faces I saw, he fitted perfectly for the title The gang in chennai is in the lookout, but they all went hiding Our biggest assets is the fear people have seeing us Have lost that all in one day Find Karthik and kill him Kill him with my hands There is no one in this house Looks like locked for while Where is Oorni? It's been 2 weeks since sir went abroad You guys are staging a drama here He is not there 10 lakh if Sethu should come It is fine but you finish the deal, don't need Sethu If he comes, everyone would burst into laughter and no one would take it serious - He is coming - Is he the one? - Where is Karthi - I don't know brother They have thrashed him at the Temple He's is safe for now, has requested and extended his stay in the hospital Your parents have reached Bombay safely Speak to them Why are we running and hiding? What did I do wrong? What didn't you? He started beating people cause someone laughed at him in a school drama Now everyone is laughing at him Because of you I didn't pull him into this He forced me to do it It's me who should chase and him for this state We've got to do something What can we do? We caught a reporter once and took him to... - Where was that? - Sugarcane field Took him there and planned to burn him alive If you had shown this 2 months back... ...there would have been no need to even make that movie Just had a thought about the evidences What is the plan? I spoke to ACP Raman This proof is enough We need to get this to Dindigul police tomorrow Dindigul? Why don't we go to Madurai only? It's risky Sethu is not a gang lord for the police to come and collect the proof We have to go for our needs Don't worry they are looking for you in Chennai That's why you are hiding here near Madurai It is better to hide beneath the enemy than across him But we can't stay hidden forever Its been a week since my kid was born, haven't seen him yet Don't worry just another 10 days Will Sethu forget everything in 10 days? No he'll be forever gone They have burned the reporter alive, will the police leave him? ACP said if the proof is good, he can move and get the order - What order? - What else? For encountering Sethu They will kill him? Let him die Every show they are talking about Sethu Yeah This A.Kumar has become the undeniable king of comedy Have you gone mad? Why are acting crazy?
