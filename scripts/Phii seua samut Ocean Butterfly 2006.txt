Well, it's freshly made and very appetizing, isn't it? The special dish will be out soon! Hey, you! I asked you, what is your name? Tan, my name is Tan. Why did you break up with your girlfriend that day? You mean on the bus? Well actually... She cheated on me with some guy I don't want to be the one who gets dumped first so I have to break up with her before she dumps me. Sorry, that day... Your boyfriend dumped you too? Thank you for yesterday, you saved my life. I think, I'll stay here a bit longer how about you? You'll be lonely when I leave, right? Do you want me to hit you again? Here we are our special dish from both of us, enjoy! A giant prawn spicy salad it's raw and still alive! Help me, please. There's chilli in my eyes, lime too and the fish sauce is salty! Hey you... Thank you very much! Why do you have to beat me in every game? Who's playing game? I just wanted to save his life you heartless beast! But that's food. Well, I feel pity on it. What? Another dead body? This is getting really serious. I told the village headman to build a shrine for them but he wouldn't listen! Now we have to loose another man. I warned him so many times not to go around that area maybe it's his time to go. Did he drowned? No, he didn't. He went fishing around the Moonlight beach I told him not to go around there. What's around that beach? Something scary. Something that killed him! Something scary? What is it? The Sea Ghost took his life. Why did you go there? The local people believed on the other side of this island is a place where the Sea Ghost lives! It's hard to question their believes. Good evening Mr. Kitti. Hurry help him! He's going to make our island popular a lot of the tourists will come here. Well, look who we have here! Who is it, sir? Tan, a photographer for the conservation. Let me give you some advice, bro. If you want to take a picture of a sea-leech or belly of the sea or anyone's belly button, be my guest! But please leave me and my work alone, OK? Only if you promise not to cheat me for my job like you did last time then I wouldn't bother you really! You're sleeping alone! Watch out for the ghost! Crazy asshole! Hurry up guys! It's almost dawn! Ting, under the water! You need to go under the water when we roll the film. And when you come up make it really scary, OK? Could you please hurry up! My dick's freezing to death. Fish are nibbling at my... Damn you! Do you want the whole island to hear? Be quiet. Karb! Are you ready? Almost... I just can't get the focus. Who told you to shoot with a good focus! I said to make it blurry! They gonna know that it's all fake, stupid! C'mon... let's roll! Bitch! Why do you keep moving? Do you want to stay in there all night? Okay I try to keep still... hurry up please! On the count of 3 you dive down for about 5 seconds then you come up from the water and make it look scary for about 3 seconds and dive down again for 10 secs. OK? OK. 5432... Damn it! Are you making out with a fish? I told you 5 seconds! Hey is he drowning? Where is he? I see him right there! Quit fooling around, I told you to dive! When you come up on this boat I'm gonna kick you till you shit in your pants! Wow he is swimming so fast just like how we want it. Help me! Yeah I want this kind of acting Great! Help... help me please! Hey, there he is! Is that dolphin? Dolphin my ass! Don't tell me that you got a blur shot of that thing! You said to shoot it blur, didn't you? Help... help me please! You stay here alone? You must have been here for a long time. Have you seen anything strange around here? Like what the local were talking about something like the Sea Ghost? You've seen it right? The blue thing that jumps out from the water. Whether or not I've seen it is none of your business! But I've seen it and I'm sure that you've seen it too! Sir have you ever hear fish talking to each other? Why, do you hear them talk? I don't know what's happening to me? All of a sudden strange things are happening to me! Tell me... who are your parents? I'm an orphan. And how old are you now? I've just turned 25 last week. Do you know something? Come close to me. Hey what are you doing? Hey what are you doing to me? So you know what is wrong with me? Rum-Pung, I miss you so much! So what kind of a creature am I? You are the same kind as my Rum-Pung. When she turned 25 she had to leave me. If you see her please tell her I miss her so much. I've never given up I'm still waiting right here for her. Right here, where we both met. From now on your body will begin to transform within the cycle of its own your own cycle, your own kind. But you were raised in a different from where you were so it's going to be very difficult for you to accept. You have to understand that it is your destiny. It's best to make up your mind and accept. Water will bring you back to who you really are. It won't be long until you have to return here again to find out the truth to follow the voice and to become one of your own. Sister... May I squirt some water on you? I don't think so. You don't want to see me getting wet. Yes I do. Happy Songkran Day. Tan, come and see this! Okay... Sea Ghost Spirit of the ocean or Ocean Butterfly. True story or fiction? Into the world of the unknown... this Sunday the secret will be revealed! Are you scare of water that much? I need your help! Please leave... I don't feel well. Quan, you didn't drowned that day, did you? Hold on a second! What did you see, tell me? I need to use the bathroom... just go! Wait a second. Open the door! No, I don't have anything to tell you. You must know something! No, no... I don't know anything. If what you said was true I think Kitti will definitely make trouble for you! I'm coming with you. We are ready to do the editing. I know. Please hurry! I'll be right there. Damn! Where the hell have you been? There you are! You think you're slick right? You're not going to run away from me this time! You think you're so slick, right? Tan, give me back my tape! Damn it! Tan! You go and get ready. Forget about the stupid tape. I'm gonna catch the live one! You wait for me here. I'm gonna find a boat. We have to eliminate the intruder! If they continued to threaten us and intrude our land. Before the eye of the ocean re-opens we have to get rid of those human first. Otherwise... the secrets of our kind will be revealed! Let's go now, I've found the boat! You get the hell out of here! Go! Please, we can settle this we are all friends here. I don't want to be friend with any of you! Well, then... it is really clear that you want to claim this part of the island just for yourself while the whole island should belong to the people of Butterfly Island! Isn't that right, people? Get lost! Don't be afraid! Karb, you go and get rid of that old fool! Ting, you go do it. Leave me alone! He said to leave him alone! Damn it! I told you to go, or we all will get killed! Shut the hell up! Stop the boat! What? What is it? Just wait for me here. Hey... Quan! Let me go, you scum bags! You gonna get yours! You got some mouth, old man? Stop talking, you old fool call out the Sea Ghost. Son, why do you have to be so harsh on him? I think we can talk to him nicely. Keep your nose out of it! Hey, how long before you guys are ready? Quickly! Almost. What the... I'm not being here anymore. You guy keep shooting. Don't stop! Rum-Pung! Help! Why are you following me for? I'm a fag. Leave me alone! I'm gay. Please stop, don't hurt human! Don't interfere! You've spent too much time with them! Come here! You want me? Tan! No! Please don't! Tan! Do you think they'll be back? I don't know but I hope that one day I'll see my Rum-Pung again and I'll wait for her right here what about you? I believe that one day she will come back to me.
