Five dollars. Dad, get up! Interview at 10. What time is it? Too late... I'll go next time. You'll get there on time. No... next time. Come on. Don't force me. I'm not. But... don't be like this. Leave me alone. You've been drunk for 5 years since mom died. Shut up! I'm your dad! You don't bother me, I don't bother you. Mind you own business, OK? Let me sleep. No... Let me sleep, OK? Good morning, mom. Good morning, son. God! Forgot the breakfast. I got it. Love you! Excuse me. $80. Do you have Gary Numan's LP? Out of stock. New shipment comes next month... Not so expensive. When? Leave your number, I'll call you. OK. See you. See you. Did you notice that guy... ...came in with his girlfriend? So...? She carried the bag for the guy! What then? They are lovers! And you ask for his number? Not funny. It's funny... you fool. I'm going out. Why's he staying in the toilet so often? Mind your own business! No work for you? Yes! I just delivered stuff and trop by... He... handsome? Wide body, narrow face... thick neck. Too much exercise! Do you have Barry Manilow? Yes. I already have this. $630. Thanks. We only accept Visa... Sorry. There're good stuff like Donny Osmond... ...over there. They sound better with vinyl. What did I say? Donny Osmond is good. Don't mind him. He's a fool. Spoiled brat. What's with you? Black card isn't for cheap things! It's for getting a sailboat. He's a little bit too much. Still using his dad's card. Do you've an appointment? Tony Wong, 4. Room A. Thanks. Take these to the client tomorrow. Study if you're free. Get you a diploma and find a good job. Don't bother me. I'm telling you what's right. Making music is not buying sex. What did you say? Have you done that? For these, can you earn much? Some. How much? A $1,000 each. How many for a month? A few. That's good? Don't lie. A few for a year. Good... you can feed yourself with it. Remember... learn to eat one meal per week. Mom... I did my job. Kei, I'm not forcing you. I don't want you to be me. Cheap clothes cost only $10. Rich ones go for big designers. We can do alternation today. Years later, we may have nothing to do. Understand? Sure. Really sure? Sure. Ying. Miss Yong. Is my dress done? Not yet... you said tomorrow. No, I need it tonight! Sorry. I'll do it now. How long? I'll take it then. OK. Sorry. She did say tomorrow. Let it be. We can't anger them. It's disastrous if they don't come. Stubborn and impolite. I can't help her. Be good... be strong for yourself, understand? Why must we take it? That's why I told you to find a better job. Leaving? Thanks. Thanks... Where're you going so late? Run errand. What's that? Real quick. I won't get in. Why's that? I don't like it. Why don't we get in? Didn't you say no? Women have many faces. Oh yeah? Change your face into Ayumi Hamasaki's. Or try Kyoko Fukada's, you fool? Stop annoying me! Not too many faces. Are we game tonight? Let's game. You choose. That one. That one? Easy! Jack, your doomed. The black widow. She's yours. No problem. I'm Jack Ming. Born to be loved! Martin, yours. OK. Quincy, you get that one. Fine. It's set. The ones who can't get the gal here... will be punished... Drink it up! Make it more exciting. Drink it like a dog! Great! Wait here. You finished? Good. What a coincidence! Do we know each other? Sure! I went to your store. Oh yeah? Can I buy you a drink? No! You come alone? Kei is here. Yeah? Hi, Lobo. Take a seat. You come here often? No. We come to hear them play. Silver Mosquitoes! Quite professional. Sure. Do you want some? Yes. Yours. You want some? You failed? First, we sing. Don't wanna admit? Be a dog! Bark... Bark! Bark! Bark! Be a dog! Beautiful. The singing isn't so good. But the lyrics are great. Yes, it is. What do you think? Good. But the vocal isn't good. He is good looking. What does look have to do with singing? You don't understand. A love song without a pretty face, it's lost all the romance A disaster if I'm the singer. What? You're the same type. You're better. Better? Dinosaur. You're T-rex! You both are weird animals. I like your song. I'd like you to hear it. My song. OK... Thanks! Leaving so early? I sang a song for you. You should come over to say hello. I don't wanna. You ain't got no manner! You're right. Hey! Hey! Why yelling? Doggie time. All yours. Drink up. You're so rude. Who said I'd drink like this? A lousy loser! I'm not! Drink it. Don't stop. Good night. My dear daughter... Sleep in your bed. I sleep here. No problem... I'm useless... A pile of shit... Don't sleep on the floor. I killed... your mother... Don't say that. No... If I had some money... your mom wouldn't have... to work so early in the morning... then she wouldn't ride on that evil bus... then she wouldn't have died. I killed your mother... I'm useless... Let me die... Kei! What's up? That song's not right. What? Here... Here... can it be like... Yeah? Don't, that's not good. Why? Such a good song... don't make it bad. I'll rearrange it. Good idea. OK. Very good. Your song? I wrote it for others. Then it's yours. I only rearrange the melody for this one. Really? Your voice is good. Must have got it from your dead father. Could dad sing? You don't remember? He worked for the funeral house. You were small. He did it this way... Pay respect to the deceased. Family members acknowledge. His voice is... the best among all the funeral houses! Fantastic! All guests please remain. Pay respect to the deceased. Family members acknowledge. You... again What's up? You gave me a hard time last night. I don't think so. My buddies made fool of me. It's nothing to do with me! Come on. What's wrong with you? I've feeling for you. I'm serious. And you? I do have feeling about you. I feel sick! Stuck-up trash! I'm what I'm! Get lost, bastard! You'll see. Hello, Kristy. Hello, Ivy. Kristy. Hi, Bobo. Kristy. Your dress is beautiful. Mom bought it. Mom loves you. Lobo, lunch time. Alright. No customer? Business is slow. Lunch time. Be good. Enjoy yourself. What do we have? Chicken and roast pork. Good! What'd Bobo like? Anything, chicken leg most. You get both, OK? Great! I think... Lobo may be dumb. I've quarreled with someone. He could hear nothing in the toilet. What is he doing inside? I don't know. Whom did you quarrel with? That bastard last night. He troubled me. Which bastard? Jack of Silver Mosquitoes. How did he trouble you? He fancies me. He's bad. Don't trust him. That why I scolded him. That's good. Why do you help him to cheat? He's taking advantage of you. Jack's lyrics are good. Almost completed. I just write the melody for his lyrics. He's using your song to trick girls. You're the accomplice. Is it that serious? Then I won't help him. Keep your words. I will, this'll be the last one. I promised him. The same from last night. Are you helping him or harming him? The entire song becomes flat. It's the only way he can sing this song. What a waste. Why doesn't he let better singer have it? Smart guys are all selfish. How can a bad guy like Jack... wrote such touching lyrics? Can't think of it, right? God is unfair. Why're there guys who're smart, rich and handsome? Not so. From certain angle... you do look pretty good. Really? Look! Hey! How about my feeling? Have you got any? That's painful! It should be, right? Come on. Feel more. Hello. Hi. I want this. Were you looking for Barry Manilow's? There's one consigned for sale. US version. But it's rather expensive. $300. It's a good copy. We only get $20 from it. OK. I'll have it. $475. Thanks. Feel free to exchange. OK. You know quite a lot of songs. I just learn at work. Do you play any instrument? I play keyboard. I learned a bit before but now I play bass. Do you have a band? Sure. What's the name? We only play at free time. By the way... There's a party tonight. Many bands join together. Do come. Come to play. It'll be great. When'll you get off? I'll pick you up. That's it. See you. What's up? Come and talk, OK? OK. What do you think? Think what? Should I go? How do I know? Is he dating me? Of course! If I go... does it mean I accept him? Yes. I'm scared. Why? We don't match. Why? He's rich and drives a sport car. Do you have feelings for him? A bit. That's it. Friends should be frank. He should like you as a person. Really? Don't pretend to be a pro. Well... I'm only guessing. I never dated a girl, you know. So kind suddenly? You're my love consultant. I still don't believe Tony'd like me. He's too good. Don't go then. Hey, are you helping? Go then. Hey! What do you want? You do fancy him. Go if you want. How dare you? It's true. There's a song for it... Which one? "Love's the Right"? No. Jordan Chan's... What the hell! Jordan Chan? Got it. "Dissoluteness". Damn you! I'm gonna pee. What the heck. So crowded? What? Can't wait? Grow a dick and get in the male toilet! What? What? Should it be OK to go? Go. The words "Smart Casual" are written right there. So what? All my clothes are black. I can't even find a better dress. Why laughing? Scum! For a good laugh, I'll help you. Come on. Batman! Goodness! So crowded? I almost wet my panties. What's up? It's expensive. Take care. What do I wear? It's OK, boots are popular this year. Really? I thought you're a thief in skirt. Kinky smile. What? You look good. Pretty new shoes. No. They're old. Really? OK. Bye. You look different. What? Bad looking? Beautiful. Get in. Tony, introduce your girlfriend to us. Kristy. I'm Amy. I'm Philo. My name's Kristy. Expensive thing. Wanna eat? Excuse me. Real stuff? Yeah. Are you good friends? No. Shell we dance? Sure. You are beautiful! What's their relationship? Who knows? Bad match. Almost the time. Right. We have a new musical friend. Please sing for us. Tony, don't be shy. You go with him. Stand here... don't move. That's rude! You said it's water! What? It's water... The trash is from her body. You've gone too far! It's you! You get her here and trick her. Don't deny. You told me... Why would you do what I said? Am I your mama? A swan becomes an ugly duckling. You stink. From which shitty place you came? Get lost! Tramp! We don't welcome you here! Shameless! Can't take a joke! What? Have we gone too far? Probably. Are we bad? Rather bad. He gave me. Me too. We are trash! You are evil! Morons! Pretty boy! You crazy? Wanna die? Sure. I died before, and you? Witches. I'll kill you! OK. We live in Tsz Wan Shan. Come. You threatened me and I'm scared. If I've any trouble, you'll pay. Bastard! Who're these girls? No idea. Just met last night. You are late! I ran. Clean your face. Don't rub with water. The dirt will stay. It's only a dress! Don't yell at me. I'll pay for it. I can afford it! Why yell at me? Coz I'm weak? No. No... Let's get you into something clean. No need. I'm ugly anyway! Day off? I took a leave. Are you sick? Did you see a doctor? No. Just need a break. Dad. I don't understand. Last night... I scolded Kei. I knew I shouldn't do it but I did. Why? Who is Kei? Don't you remember? I knew him when I was small. He lives in that old building... Is there such a guy? His look's common. Then? Nothing. Hey... I wanna know more. I don't wanna talk. Once again. Kei is short. I knew him from 5. He is my only friend. Last night I scolded him for nothing. Why I take things out on him? It has something to do with him? You vent your anger on him... That's not so good. Think about it... How many people would listen to you and get blamed by you? I don't know who is Gay, But he's so willing... proves that he cares for you. You can't pick on the one who's kind to you. That's not right. His name is Kei. Sorry. When your mom was alive... When I'd a bad time at work. she'd serve me a hot towel. No matter how late, she'd cook for me. I remember. Your mom let me know I'm not trash... I'm not junk. Being kind to your loved ones is important. But... I don't want you to trust that Wai so easily... Wai? Your friend. Kei! Sorry! Shorties are perverts! Dad! Don't let him write songs and sing. Sexual maniac! You're a girl! Does she understand? Kei. Sorry. Nothing. Scold me, please. I'll feel better. Silly girl. Blow me up. I wanna stab you in return. No. Not sincere at all. Treat you a dinner. I dare not! Last time I drank your coke and got blown up. Don't be so mean, please. You're not angry now? Not at all. Kristy. Auntie. Welcome. OK. I'll pay for the dress. It's fixed. Don't lie. Kei, what've you done? Nothing. That's weird. It was small size. Now it fits me. Voodoo! Same work. Not at all. More cloth... I can make a skirt for you! What the hell! What the hell! It's yours? I gotta work. How much? I'll pay. No. Come on! It's $2,600. I'll pay you the rest. $500 only. Don't lie to me. The dress I lent you... was 2 years old. I got one from a second hand shop. Thank you. I'll get back. You're leaving, Kristy? Bye. Bye. My treat tonight. Sure. Kei, you're more miraculous than ever. You could buy this season's dress which's made 2 years ago! Is Warrent-dino your good friend? Why do you wear it? Just a tiny spot. Let's go to Red Box to sing and have buffet! OK. Is the dress... your first gift to me? Didn't I give you anything? Nothing that can't be defecated. Oh yes! What about the marbles I gave you? Oh yes! But marbles can also be defecated. Let's go. Sure. We've a good time... Bill please. Which song is it? The theme song of Fatal Contact called Black Rain Storm. Come out in October. I wanna see. Let's go together. Sure. Staring Ronald, Wu Jing, Theresa and Miki. It'd be great. Sure. Wu Jing's great and Ronald's funny. Plus 2 pretty ladies. Can't miss. How come we talked nonsense? Nonsense? Are we wrong? Thanks. Silly. We're old friends. Good night, old friend. Good night. Check out. I'll give you another one. We take all cards. Why do you... always get a big room for yourself? Get used to be lonely. You don't have family? Is this your card? No. Maybe it's all the same. I fear if others know I'm incompetent. Your songs are not bad. You've heard it? I heard. A person gotta be good and trust oneself. No one believed in me before. Told me to shave this mustache. But now I'm OK. Thanks. Aren't you George Lam? He's my dad. See you. Why did you say Tsz Wan Shan? Just pop up. Where did you learn that street talk? I learnt it from watching "Election". Are you scared he'd take revenge? My dog is more scary. I ask for your help. What's up? Somebody's here for you. Come in. Why are you here? I'm here to say sorry. I'm here to say sorry. Me too. No need. Sorry... It's nothing to do with Tony. It was Jack's doing. He told Tony to bring you there. Tony knew nothing. It's true. He told us it'd be water. I know it's wrong. Our bank broke up. Broke up? Sure. How about the Contest? We go as a new band. Who'll sing "Waterlogged"? Jack. He wrote it. No way! Why you nervous? That's my song. You wrote it? You don't need the money. You too young to understand. Why? A middle-ager like me... do want a young man to sing my song. Can I get on stage and be a fool? Jack's a big ego. We'd love to beat him. But our song... isn't good enough. He may win. Fools! You're all song writers. Join force and beat him. Ain't I smart? Super smart! Sorry... Lobo, I wanna know... how should I handle this part? I'll go pee. Lower... maybe. Better. Let's try then. OK. Wait for Kristy. Dad? Why are you here? Just bring you soup. You work hard. We don't wanna lose. Good. Why don't you come in? I won't disturb you. Share the soup with your friends. What is it? Soup. I never thought I'd be a part of this band. You're too good. You're good. Not so. Why don't you ask your band to come? You have a band? That's a lie. I don't have a band. A lie like that? I have no friends. My friends... they all envy others and compare each others wealth. They're all money whores. Kristy, just like your grandaunt. She's a real headache. Every time she sees me she asks... How're you lately? Just so she can brag about her daughter's high paying job. She'd die if she couldn't degrade me. My parents are all the same. Money is everything. I don't like them. Bad relationship? We're strangers. In my family, only boys can inherit family wealth. I'm just a tool for getting it. I was sent away when I was 6. Boarding school is my orphanage. Be strong for yourself. That's why we gotta do it well... Prove to the world that we can do it. Yeah! Let's jam! One, two, three, four... Are you crazy? You sang well. Sure. You're good. Don't play with me. You take the lead. Are you crazy? Your voice is great. I can't... What do you think? Don't ask me. I don't know. So early? You bought breakfast? Congee? My cooking. Eat while it's hot. Practice so early? Sure. Contest in the afternoon. Gotta practice more. You can do it. Will you come? Absolutely. Don't rush. You look good... Where're you going? Good enough? I have an interview. Clean up when finished. Dad! Ichiban! Work hard! Kristy? Are you still angry with it? No at all. Can we've dinner...? Nothing special. Just as friends. OK. Let's invite Kei and Lobo too. Sure. Jack? What a coincidence. Big spender! You hire top professional musicians? Yeah, I'm rich. Filthy rich, you're! You can't sing. I can't? You can? You'll lose for sure. I am Jack Ming. Yeah, born to be a piece of shit! Let's go. He'd stolen our song. He changed the title. Shameless! Do we have another one? It's not booger? Can't pick it out at will. I've one. From your bottom? Witch craft? "Kong"? Great! Who are you, really? The important moment is here. I've the winners in my hand. Here it's... The 2nd runner-up is So Sweet. The 1st runner-up... Joe, Quincy and Martin's "Battles". I'm so nervous... Who will be the one? The winner also got no band name. Kristy, Kei, Tony and Lobo..."Kong"! Daughter, yeah! Dad's great! Will I have another chance? Let's not talk about this, OK? Wait! Are you OK? Leave in peace! There're plenty of pretty girls... for a handsome boy like me. Why you worry? You go. That's another lie. Even if I can get chicks for free... I'll only think of you. "Kristy, why are you here?" Come here right now! What's up?
