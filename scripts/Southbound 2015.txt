All you lost souls racing down that long road to redemption, and all you sinners running from your past, but heading straight into that bitter darkness up ahead. We're all on that same endless highway. The one with no name and no exits. Looking for a way out of tonight and into tomorrow. Well, they gonna try to stop you, but you got to say "Fuck it" and keep moving. Because this is your highway. And tonight might just be the night you finally out run those wicked demons, once in for all. And I'll be right here with you making sure you get where you're going. What's up? Nothing. Don't worry, we're fine. It's customer's only. Hey! Read the sign. Twenty on the truck. Rough night? Yeah. Have a nice day. Mich, let's get the fuck out of here. Come on! Come again soon. Fuck! What the fuck? What the fuck? Rough night? What the fuck? There's gotta be a way out. What if there's not? Pullover. - What? - Pullover. Are you crazy? What you gonna do? I'm not running. Mich! Mich! Hey! Hey! I know we've had a pretty fucked up day, but if you can keep it together for a little bit longer that'll be great. Why? What are we running to? What? So we get out of here and go home and then what? And then nothing we're home, that's the point. Back to normal. Exactly. Mich. You wanted this. We did this for you, we did this for Catherine. So get in the fucking truck! I'm not asking you to stay. You've lost it, man. You want to stay here and get killed? I'll see you around. Jack, come on. What do you want? I think you've figured it out, they've come to collect. There's no way out, we've fucked up! You know what, Mich, fuck you! I'm going home. Jack! Dad. Catherine? Dad why won't you help me? Catherine! Dad help me! Catherine! Help! Dad! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Fuck! It's piercing my brain. My God, it's one o'clock. Guys we got to go. Ava, get up. I've never been so hungover in like... You guys got everything? It's to early for this! Southbound baby. Goin' on down that road and each time hold on and don't ever let go. Yeo! Hannah. Whoa! Man, this thing is fucked. Of course, the one day we can't afford to stop, we get a flat. It would be fine if your drum kit didn't have to take up so much space. But it wasn't my idea to take out the spare tire, Kimberly. Whatever, I'll just call triple A, can you hand me my bag? Nope. Do you even know where we are? GPS can't even find us on my phone. No we're not on a private road. We're in the middle of the state highway right now. Why is it so hot? We can't help you. Well, yeah. Thanks for nothing. The closest place is four hours from here. And it's closed. - Why? - It's so early. The chick on the phone sounded like she was at a bar. Which reminds me. Wait, you're not serious, Kim. What? It's not like we going anywhere. Warm beer. Guys, car! Great! I was seriously thinking who I'll have to eat first, see you by the way. Youngest. Can we offer you a ride? Is there a town close by? Triple A says there's nothing for miles. No we are pretty far out. Actually closest town is quite a way south. You would wanna go to Pete's auto body. Okay. Talk to Pete. He's not gonna be there until tomorrow, though. Why don't you come to our place? Just until we can get hold of Pete. Thanks a lot really, but we're good. We're used to sleeping in the van. You know, Betty, I wonder if the camper at Kensington has the same size tire as the van? Sure they have a spare. Bet the boys could fix it right up. Yeah! I guess maybe we could. No, we're good, thank you, though. Really. Well, suit yourselves. Goodbye. Wait! What? What are you doing? We don't know where we are. We haven't seen... This is not a good idea, to go with those complete weirdos. Look at us, look at them. We're the weirdos. I'd rather go with them than with a bunch of rappie dudes. So are you girls students? No, we're not, we are in a band. Fun, a rock and roll group. - Yup. - We play jazz. Smooth jazz. I do love jazz. So, how long have you guys lived out here? I don't know, since the war. Is that a trap or something? It probably was, but broken now. Phonies. This is your fault, okay? All right then. You don't have to worry about locking it up, there's no one around for miles. Come on. Here we are, the bathroom's right there. Nap, shower, anything that you need to do. The Kensington's are going to be coming over for supper. It's just so wonderful to have some company. I'm sorry about Alex. What did you just say? It's so wonderful to have some company. No, before that. - I will whip up some supper for us. - Thank you. What the fuck! They aren't old right? They act like they're eighty and from the fifties. Bet they have the nastiest sex. Wait. Did you guys hear that? What are you talking about? Kim, this totally looks like you. You like a hot milk maid. They definitely have the nastiest sex. My cousin is a Sunday school teacher and she loves anal. I really don't think I'm hearing things. You're so gross. You started it. This bed is like a freaking cloud. I don't think it's a good idea for us to take a nap here, Ava. Hey, you totally had sex with that old guy just because he had a Tempur-Pedic mattress. Okay, he wasn't old. Old. He was pretty old. He was 49, that's not old. - That's so old. - That's old even for me. Stop talking to me. She's done it again. This is beautiful. Just beautiful. How lucky we are that you have access to these old family recipe's, Betty. So, you guys have a tire? For the van! Yes, sure, the boys will fix that up for you. Wont you, boys? Sorry, are these your son's? You look so young. You just made Betty's year with that one. Actually we adopted the boys, it's a long sad story. Let's give thanks. Divine one, we offer our gratitude for this beast. For this blood. For these vessels of a new. We bow to you, for you all knowing. We offer ourselves to you. For you are the master. Amen. Um, what exactly is in this dish? It's a Sunday roast. I probably should have mentioned before that I don't eat meat. I see. You know there are some who just don't have the luxury to not eat meat. Only the strong survive, right, boys? So you guys Russian or something? Russian? That is a good one. No. Raymond and Betty their just very traditional. Set in their ways, as are we. But it is no matter, everything is fine, you don't have to eat the meat. It's actually really good. It is. I thought there was four of you. Enough. This place feels like a bad acid trip. Those twins. What the fuck was that prayer all about? Why do you have be so negative? Seriously? Yeah! So we got a flat. What the fuck! We're here. With a roof over our head, we got free dinner. What's the big deal? Why can't you just make the best of things. I don't know, cause we have a show to play tomorrow. And we're stuck in some house, in the middle of nowhere, on some road that doesn't seem to exist. Sorry if I'm being a bummer by pointing this out, but this isn't exactly normal. Nothing's ever your fault. - What? - Nothing. Just... miss Alex that's all. If she were here everything would've been different. Yeah, so do I, obviously. Then why did you let her leave? What did you say? You let her leave that night. You wanted to fuck some... nobody asshole in some... shit hole club. I hope it was good. I hope it was really good. Why are you doing this right now? You know that I loved her more than anything. It's not funny, Kim. You should see your face right now. What the fuck, man, that's so messed up. I didn't make her leave that night, it's not my responsibility... My God! My God! Okay, I'm gonna get you towel. Jesus! Hey! They're really sick. Ava and Kim can't stop throwing up this black stuff all over the place. We have to do something. Dear. It's probably the meat. Newcomers. Well, the first time is the worst time. What is in that meat? What is going on? I got just the thing. They'll be fine as soon as they get some medicine. Nice play. Thank you so much. This medicine is wonderful. Of course, darling. See? All better now. Are you sure you don't want to change into something more comfortable? Yeah, I'm sure, thank you. Shouldn't we be calling a doctor, though? Don't you worry, Dale knows what he's doing. Old family recipe. Yeah, from the old world? Yes, young lady, from the old world. But I swear if I could market this I'd be rich. Sleep tight. - Guys we have got to go. - You need to calm down. Let's just get some sleep. Some peace, while the boys can come fix our van. What? No. We go take their tire and we get on the road. I will pay for a hotel. I'm not going anywhere. How do we even get to the van tonight? I'm going to bed. I'm so, so sleepy. How are you guys acting like nothing is wrong right now? I wish Alex was here. I know. Me too. But she's dead. I wish Sadie was a better friend to Alex. I have more faith in you than that. Why did you leave me here? My God. Let us rejoice. Let us rejoice. Hear now his creed. Contentment thou shall find, through suffering. And through long years in it. For the damned do not grow old. Their minds are nourished. Are living in the dark waters of the Gods. Know us now. Thou has begun my transition. Thou has begun my transition. Thou has begun my transition. Thou has begun my transition. Thou has begun my transition. Damned do not grow old. Thou has begun my transition. Damned! Do not grow old. Thou has begun my transition. Thou has begun my transition. Thou has begun my transition. Don't be a baby. You left me there to die. Now we can all be together. Hey! - Black. - Black, pink, black. I like pink, go with pink. - Of course you do. - You look great in it. You want to wear the black I know. Of course I want to wear the black. I... Yeah, where were we? Lucas, what just happened? Seems I've lost my train of thought. Lucas? Lucas, you okay? I gotta call you back. Hello? Hey! Are you okay? Miss I... - Hey. - Lucas, you okay? Yeah. Damn it! Don't do that to me all I heard was this god-awful screeching sound, I thought you're being attacked or something. You need to come early. When are you coming home? Baby? Talk to me. Lucas? Hey, what's up? Honey, I've got to call you back, okay. I'm sorry. I love you. 911, what's your emergency? I just hit a woman with my car. You just hit a woman with your car. Was she on foot? Yeah, she's in this road right now, she's very badly hurt. She's very badly hurt. Okay we got it. Where are you right now? I'm on... I'm on... I'm in the middle of nowhere. Sir, sorry, you're breaking up. I said, I'm in the middle of nowhere! What do I do? Okay, sir, I can't send an ambulance if I don't know where you are. Is there a cross street? No, there's... Um, there is some lights up ahead. I think there is a town a few miles ahead. Okay, so there's a town. Can you tell me anything about where that... I can't find it on my GPS, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm passing you to emergency medical, one moment. Okay. Hello, can you hurry up please? - Sir it's okay, are you there? - Yes I'm here. I'm the certified EMT, are you with her now? Yup. Great, describe her condition to me. She's got a headed trauma and some broken bones. - Multiple broken bones I think. - Okay, anything else? She's got a compound fracture of her knee. I think. - Is she's breathing? - Yup. - Is she conscious? - I can't be clear. - You're doing fine. - Sir? Lucas? Yeah. - Lucas? - How do you know my name? We have your cell. - Right, of course. - You need to trust us, okay? Okay. She's in critical condition and we can't seem to locate you so we like you to try and move her. You want me to move her? You said there's a town up ahead, right? All right, okay. You're okay. Okay, I got her in the back seat, we're are driving. I'm heading south. Are you still with me? Can you hear me? Yeah we're here just stay with us, okay? You're doing just great, Lucas. There's a lot of cracks in the windshield, I cannot see very well. What I am looking for when I get there? - We're gonna talk you through it. - All right, good. I'm doing about 80 right now, I think I can go faster, I'm gonna go faster. Lucas? You need to say something to her. Yeah. You know, in case she can hear you. I'll do everything I can. Lucas, tell us when you're close. Okay, just got into town. There's shops, I see a barber shop. I see there's a tattoo parlor, a church. Do you see any people? Anyone on the side of the road? Anyone you can ask for help? No, I don't see anyone, there's nobody. What about on coming traffic? Can you flash your lights at the on coming traffic? No, I don't see anyone. There's no on coming traffic? Or there's no people? Okay, wait a minute. Okay, there's a sign up here. It's a hospital sign, I think I'm pulling up into a local hospital. Dispatch to vehicle. He's located a medical facility of some sort. Be advised, no contact. Local PD. Lucas we'll stay with you till you've made contact. Just make sure you stay with us until then. Help! I need some help! Hello? Hello, I've an emergency. Is there anybody here? Sir, is there some sort of a problem? Did you run into a problem? - Hello? - Sir, is there a problem? Lucas? Lucas, can you... What the fuck! Hey! Sir, what's the problem here? - We need you to talk to us. - 'Cause we can help. Sir? Sir, we need you on the line, telling us what you see, we need you to keep talking to us. - Sir? - There's no one here. - It's abandoned or something. - Okay, calm down, sir. Is no one fucking here? Sir, I need you to calm down, I'm sure there's someone near by. I'm gonna need you to find the nearest surgeon, nurse, who ever you can find. - I need you to find the closest person. - There is no one here. You understand? I'm looking, I do not see anyone. Okay, how is the victim? - How is the victim? - I don't know what's happening. Lucas, what about the girl? How is she doing? Shit. Fuck. No. - Lucas how is she doing? - Not good. Okay, what's happening? Her leg is, is broken. She's bleeding really, really bad. All right. Focus. Need to stop the bleeding. I need you to look for anything you can use. - Like a tourniquet? - Yes. All right, I got it. Okay, now wrap it around her leg. All right, how tight do I make it? - Tight as you can. - Okay. Somethings happening, she's moving, I don't know what to do. - Sir, you need to focus. - Okay, tell me what am I supposed to do. Lucas, is she responsive? - I don't know what that means. - How is the breathing? It's upsetting. There's blood bubbling out of her mouth. He's losing her. I need to hear it. - Can you hear? - Yes. Now listen carefully, you have to intubate her, do you know what that means? Stick a tube in her throat. Exactly, now you wanna find a specific kit for that. Pretty standard stuff but it's specific. - Lucas? - What am I looking for? Package or a cabra bag, probably has a cubic meter on the front. In variant shape or size. What am I looking for? It's best to look for the word intubation. Or tracheal, endotracheal or tracheal intubation. Any of those. Or airway, airway aesthetician, airway management kit, EMS airway. That's the one we use. Anything that has those words on it, just tell me what you find. Lucas, tell me what you find. You see anything that looks like that? - Got it. - Okay good, first open the kit. Look for a curved blade, it's a metal hand tool. There's no blade it's just the tube. - Just the tube? - That's right. You'll have to do manually. First identify the glottis. It's a little squishy valve at the back of the throat. Feel for the breath. You want me to stick my fingers in her throat? Yes. You have to, it's the intubation and have it ready. You need to hurry, you have to do it now. All right, locating it. Okay. You must go farther Lucas, all the way to the back of the tongue. - Now do it. - Okay. Insert the tube. Don't hesitate. Keep going... keep going. Fuck! She's biting me. She's biting me. What happened? - What's happening? - Something is wrong. She's close to death. Who is this? Hello? Who is this? I'm the surgeon, Lucas. I've been listening since you've arrived. - Okay! - He's here to help. Do you want to save her life? Yes! Then whatever you do, do not remove your hand from her throat. Trust me the tube is not set and is the only thing giving her oxygen, the only thing keeping her alive. But it's also killing her. She's got several broken ribs on her right side and the diaphragm is unable to compress the lung. She can't breath, you must compress the lung. - How do you know that? - You must compress the lung. - I didn't tell you that. - You must compress the lung. No, look I need a minute here I'm not really sure how... I must compress the lung. Fine. What the fuck does that mean? First use your free hand to expose the rib cage. Okay. Okay, now what? - Slowly, carefully. - You can do this Lucas. - Now what? - Make an incission. - An incission? - Make an incission. You have to. Okay. You have the blade? Five to seven inches. Just below the rib cage. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly. Okay. - Find the lung. - Okay I got it. Compress the lung. Fuck! Fuck! Locked? Fuck! Fuck! Claire! Claire's not here, we're still on. We're going to have to talk about this, Lucas. I don't deserve this. Really? Why don't you elaborate? She was out in the middle of the road. In the middle of the fucking night. In the middle of nowhere. How am I supposed to have expected... I mean it's... It's an extraordinary circumstance, okay? How am I supposed to be... - Lucas, it's okay. - Absolutely okay. Right! You had no way of knowing. She was in the middle of the road. In the middle of the fucking night. In the middle of nowhere. It doesn't have to be your fault, Lucas. Go be with your wife. I can just walk out of here. - Yeah. - Yes. - Yes. - I can leave? Yes. And you aren't tricking me again? No, Lucas. Find the locker room. You'll see. Do I need to worry about what's back there? - No. - Absolutely not. You were never here. Okay. I'm hanging up now. That's good, Lucas. Good night. I'll take a beer and a shot of whiskey. You forgot to shut the door. No, I didn't. It didn't latch. Come on, Al! I've been on my feet for hours, just give me a beer. First the door. Seriously? It's shut! It's fine. Sounds pretty sure of herself, Al. At the same time, being sure is sort of a... fancy way of being lazy. You want to go check the door? I mean... You can see from here it's not shut all the way. I'll buy you a beer. Well... when you put it like that. All right, everybody. Put your hands on the tables. Cooperate and we'll get these over with real fucking quick. - You, sit the fuck down! - Hang on, buddy. Put your hands on the table. What the fuck part of "put your hands on the table" so hard for you to understand? Maybe before we all get carried away here. We stop and think for a minute? - How's that sound? - That sounds great. I know that one shitty bar might look like just any other. But here's some free advice. Get back on whatever road it was that brought you here. And keep moving. 'Cause I guarantee you, that robbing this place, is way more trouble than it's worth. This is not a robbery! This is my sister. Her name is Jessy. I know that she's in this town. Now, I don't want to hurt anybody. But I'm telling you right the fuck now, I'll do anything, to find her. Put your fucking hands on the bar! Thank you! Anyone? Anybody see her? Where'd you get that tattoo? Did you get that around here? I don't know if I can kill you. But I bet that hurts like a motherfucker! One more step! One more fucking step. Last time, have you seen her? Yeah! Yeah? - Where? - No where you can go, big shot. You'll fucking take me. Move, motherfucker! Get in. Get in. And drive. Fucking go, man. Where are my road warriors at? You might be an old dog but you still can learn some new tricks. So, what's stopping you? You don't owe the world, shit! Each time live your own life and if someone is dumb enough to stand in... You don't get a lot of time before the whole valley finds out, but, - you know that, don't you? - Yeah. If I need you to, I'm going to have you drive off the road. You don't want to do that. Looks like the desert, but if you go out there, you might not come back. What the fuck are we doing here? It's around back. - In there. - In where? What? How do we get in? Through the door. Quit being so fucking mysterious. Sorry. That's okay, Danny. How did you know my name? You're fucked, Danny. And you don't even know it yet. Don't you wanna see her? Yeah. Jessy? Jessy, it's me Danny. Danny? Danny, you... Are you really here? I'm really here. My God, you're hurt. It's nothing. It's nothing, I can't believe I found you. How did you even get here? Man, Danny, you got old. I've been searching for you for thirteen years. - You look absolutely incredible. - Danny, wait. Yeah, what? How did you get here? No. Danny, don't. - What the hell are you doing? - What the hell are you doing? I'm saving you, I came to get you the hell out of here. Danny, I don't want to leave. You don't mean that, Jessy, now get out of the fucking way. - She does mean it, Danny. - Shut up. She's here because she wants to be. Come on, Danny. It's time for you to leave. Danny! - Come on. - Help. Get your fucking hands off of me. Turn us around. God damn it! You're such an asshole. I'm okay with that. Just let me be an asshole and get you the hell out of here. Fuck! Danny. You're not supposed to go out there. If you do this, it's for you. It's not for me. I don't have a choice. I can't see anything. There's nothing to see. Fucking car is gonna fall apart. Don't slow down. You're not supposed to be here. You can't stay here. You can't take me with you. I'm not leaving you behind. You need your gun. You have the gun, Danny? You might have to blow my brains out too Stop it. No, you can't stop. You can't stop, Danny, it's too late. Before they stop! Fuck. Danny. This place is made for people like me. You shouldn't be here. I mean this whole time growing up, didn't you ever think about mom and dad? - What do you mean? - Come on, Danny, tell the truth. Hey, you really never thought it was my fault. You can't... blame yourself for what happened. No. You're not listening to what I'm saying. - You were a kid, we were... - I killed them, Danny. I killed them because I wanted to. Right now I'm here because I wanna be here. This place found me and I love it here. Jessy help me! Jessy! You should have let me go. I just wanted to save you. Jessy! Jessy! What are you looking at? Well, I'm looking forward to that. - Hey! - You can leave your stuff everywhere. - Hey, sweetie! . Hey, honey. I'm so glad we got to do this before you start school. - Me too. - Whoa. Let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay? We still have this one last weekend to have fun. Play games and puzzles. Make s'mores, with our little girl. It's just so exciting, sweety. Well, we all know the past can be piece of shit sometimes. But when it catches up to you, you better be ready. Keep your eyes on the road and let that engine roar so loud that you can't hear those demons screaming in your ear. Lock your doors, make those tires burn. Tell your family you love them and kiss the past goodbye. For once and for all. Because every road gotta end somewhere. Am I right? All right. Sure looks better in the pictures. Got some charm. Listen why don't you go unpack and we'll have dinner ready in an hour. Cool. I'm gonna open some wine. Don't you think she's ready? Of course not. Is anyone ever? At a certain point we just gonna have to trust the future, right? Let's hope that she learn to believe in herself. And that she'll stand-up for herself. She will. Question is, are you ready? I'll be fine. Hold on, honey, let your dad get it. This next one might be familiar to some of you. Who is it? For all of you out there, who don't want the night to end. So, go ahead, make some mistakes... Hello? You can always get it right the next time. No one's there. What is it? Honey, call the cops. - What? - Call the cops now, go! - Okay. - Dad, what is it? 911, what's your emergency? Someone's trying to break into the house. What's the address? It's 6255, Bethel lane. Just take a deep breath, we're gonna be there in about thirty minutes. What? You are going to be fine. - Dad? - Darryl? Dad. It's gonna take thirty minutes. Dad, what's going on? We gotta get out of here. Come here. What do you want? What do you want? Why are they doing this? What about Jim? What the fuck do you want from us? Please what? I'm sorry. What are you talking about, baby? What are you talking about? I'll give you anything you want. Let me know what I can do to make this right, please. My God! You told... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, no. I could not. No, no, Kate. No. No! No! No... She was innocent. She was innocent. Jim, go! Go! Go! Bitch! What do you want from us? What do you want from us? Go! Go! Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry. Hey! Get up! Help. We let you go! Fuck you! What have we done? Fuck! Shit, run! Mich! What the fuck! What the fuck! Un-fucking-believable. Fuck! - What about Shane? - Fuck Shane. Shane was an asshole! What the fuck is that thing? Shit! Fuck this shit! Let's go home. Regret and remorse. Amends and atonement, that's life, right? This next one is for you. For all you lost souls racing down that long road to redemption. And all you sinners running from your past, but heading straight into that bitter darkness up ahead. We're all on that same endless highway, the one with no name and no exits. Looking for a way out of tonight and into tomorrow. Well, they're gonna try to stop you, but you got to say 'fuck it' and keep moving. 'Cause this is your highway. And the day might just be the day, you finally out run those wicked demons. Once and for all. And I'll be right here with you, making sure you get where you're going. Because in the end we're all just trying to find our way home. Right? Rough night? Yeah
