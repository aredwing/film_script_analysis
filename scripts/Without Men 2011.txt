And I'm still mad at you. -Voices Men. Rosalba? Marqel? Mother ... What are you doing? I turned. I'm the mayor now. -You're back? I am a little mentally unbalanced. But I'm alive. I'll keep you safe.

And I want to get my wife back. If it is still my wife. No? Want to tell me that Rosalba became, you know ... Why do not you ask? All right. You are confused. -The one who's confused you. That when doing Ubalina love and called me. That was a misunderstanding. I'm sorry if I hurt. Can you forgive me? Rosalba? Can we stay? Why you ask permission? Shut up. That's this town. She belongs to me. Mine is bigger than yours. I'll be on their side? And you? I'll turn my back? I love this woman. No matter how the head is believed, I love everything. You are traitors. Lesbian! Where the hell is my article? Our cover article! Just kidding. A village led by women who want to survive? Impossible. A myth. A legend. -Tell me you did not destroy article to protect them. Why would I do that? -I think it was a good vagina. You know what Gordon. Men can have the will, women will always win. I think in the end, Gordon found something more important than the article. Consciousness. An American consciousness. If you say, you have to go. I can not do that. -So? What to do? What is right. Ladies and gentlemen, It is time to stop the fight. Who is stronger, smarter ... or who is right. Must live together as a society with equal rights. I learned to live without you ... and live with you. I want to be happy. The devil has been defeated. Life is back to normal. Cleo, wait! Do not go. -Need to know. Love men? Or you love women? I love you. You see the story with a happy ending, for Rosalba, must learn to control how everything ... Miguelina and Angel, were blessed with a child. I do not know if boy or girl. Hulio, no longer thought of as wear dresses size 8. The Gringos and Lucretia, teach ... biology? Cecilia learned to drive. Now we have to let it down. Women and men worked together as long as man knew his place. That does not mean that God will not send a real savior. Not a happy ending until I say. In the name of God, are here absolve you of all sins. Are you ready to receive me, baby? 1995 - 2011 Jerdian Subtitle Ltd  Men Without 2011
