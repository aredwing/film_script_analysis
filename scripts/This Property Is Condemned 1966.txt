You seen a kite? Don't talk to me till I fall off. Here, come here! Hurry, will you? Run, stupid! Here, take my crazy doll, will you? I don't want to break her when I fall. I don't think I can stay on much longer. This is the furthest I've ever gone without once falling off. - Hurt yourself? - Skinned my knee. Good thing I didn't put my silk stockings on. - Spit on it. That takes the sting away. - OK. - Hey, are you OK? - Yeah, I guess so. Principal damage was done to my bracelet. Knocked out a diamond. - It wasn't a genuine diamond. - How do you know? If it was, you wouldn't be out walking railroad tracks. Not with a banged-up doll and a piece of a rotten banana. I forgot to ask. What's your name? - Tom. - Mine's Willie. - How did that happen? - I was expected to be a boy, but I wasn't. They already had one girl, Alva. That was my sister. - Why ain't you in school? - I thought it was gonna be windy. - So I could fly my kite. - What made you think that? 'Cause the sky's so white. Hey... why ain't you in school? I quituated. They started on algebra. I didn't care what X stood for, so I quit. You ain't gonna get an education walking a railroad track. You ain't from flying a kite neither. Besides, what a girl needs to get along is social training. I learned that from Alva. She was mighty popular with the railroad men. - Train engineers? - Engineers! Engineers, firemen, brakemen, conductors, the freight superintendent, every one of them after Alva. She was, I guess you might say, the main attraction. Beautiful? Jeez! Boy, you see that house over yonder? - We had some high old times in there. - I'll bet you did. Musical instruments going all the time. Piano, victrola, Hawaiian steel guitar... Everybody playing on something. It's awful quiet now, though. - Is it empty? - Except for me. They got a big sign stuck up. "This property is condemned". - You ain't still living there? - I'm not supposed to be, but I am. Property's condemned, but there ain't nothing wrong with it. Some welfare worker came yesterday. I recognised her by the shape of her hat. It was something, all right. You wouldn't believe it. Sure is empty now, though. - Boy, see these clothes I got on? - Yeah. They're Alva's. Inherited from her. Everything that was Alva's is mine. She was always singing around that house. This is her favourite song. Wish me a rainbow and wish me a star All this you can give me Wherever you are And dreams for my pillow And stars for my eyes And a masquerade ball Where our love wins first prize All my tomorrows depend on your love So wish me a rainbow above OK, here she is. Dodson. Get ready to hit the ground running. Mind if I asked you a question? Doing the things that you do, how do you sleep? On my stomach. My mama in here? We got a problem on our hands. She went back this way, Willie. You seen my mama? You shouldn't be out here alone, sporting a big diamond like that. You scared me! And it ain't a real diamond. - Sparkles like one to me. - No. It's a firefly. Gotta... - Willie, where's your ma? - I don't know. - Gotta snip off its tail... when it's lighted. - Do you belong to that boarding house? That's the Starr Boarding House. I'm Willie Starr. Well, how do you do, Willie? You railroad? - Why do you ask? - We get mostly railroad men. Mama will put you up some place... soon as I find that old thing! Mama? That you, Mama? Willie, quit that hollering! Leave them alone! Come on. - Where've you been? - Down to Jake's to see if Alva's there. - Who are you, honey? - He wants a room. - You ain't a vagrant? - No. - Lay-off? - No. Well, my rooms are two a night... Where are you going? I got the beer! - Happy birthday! - Two a night, ten bucks a week. Two meals included. Cash in advance. - How long you fixing to stay? - Five... A week... Ten. About a week. Only a week? Well, a buck is a buck. If you're lucky. Hey, where's the beer? It ain't usually so noisy. Some old fool got hold of it's my birthday. - Happy birthday! - Damn fool! What's your name, honey? - Owen Legate. Happy birthday. - What room? - No, you can't go yet! I just got the beer! - What room? - Better put him in Papa's room. - I forgot to say. There's gonna be a fight. Jimmy Bell done got drunk and Charlie Steinkamp's gonna lay him out! Hey, wait a minute. You knew it was firefly, didn't you? Hey... Come on in, honey. You wanna meet anybody, you just introduce yourself. - Ain't she back? - I haven't seen her. She don't come soon, I got an awful early run. Your change, Mr Johnson. I got a dozen. Should be enough. I don't see how you can stand still with all that music going. I know you'd prefer to dance with Alva, but today is my birthday. - What about Mr...? - I can only please one at a time! You can take Mr what's-his-name upstairs and settle him in. Excuse me. Show him the bathroom. We got an indoor toilet, modern bathing equipment. It isn't complicated once Alva and I show you how. Give him something to eat. Then you come and join the party. Oh! - JJ, you scared the life out of me! - I been waiting for you in the car. He works in the shop when he ain't with Mama. - Are all these people railroad? - All except for the guy on the guitar. He's the sheriff. Come on. - Hey, Max. - Hey, Willie. This is Papa's room. He painted those. It's not the best in the house. He tried to paint it. I like it. Okey-doke? Okey-doke. Hey, Alva! Get your hot stuff out here! - Lindsay! Lindsay Tate! I'll be back. - We don't want you. We want Alva! We want Alva! We want Alva! We want Alva! Get out of here! Get out of here, Lindsay Tate, before I call my mama. You just do that. Tell your mama if Alva ain't here, we'll take her instead. - Why, you little snip! - Mama! Mama! - Mama! - What the hell are you doing? Fire up the engines, boys! Let's go! You stay away from those older boys or I'll whip you! - Willie, where you going? - Let me go! - Stop it! - Alva! - Hey, Willie. Sidney! - What's the matter with Sidney? Nothing that sticking his head under the faucet won't solve. Come on! Alva! What you doing in the kitchen? - We've been waiting for you. - Bye! - How's the party? - Alva, where you been? Alva, honey! Why don't you come over here and swap words with Mr Johnson. Hey, Mr Johnson! Hey, JJ. - Let me go, JJ. - Just relax. JJ! - All right, baby! - My, what a handsome couple! Go to Mr Johnson. He's been pestering me all night about you. He did pay for this party as a surprise. Mr Johnson! Here's my bad little girl. She wants to sit beside you and cheer you up. - Hey, Alva, where y'all been? - Hey! Oh, out dancing. - A beer, Miss Alva? - No, thanks. I told you before, lay off Alva. It was real nice of you to give Mama this lovely party. Well, I didn't do it for her. Alva, I asked your Mama. She says it's OK for you to go with me to the Moonlight Casino tomorrow. - Well, let me think about it. - They got a real good band. A new one, Odel Otis, and Kansas City Steaks. Well, I really don't know. Sidney! Hi! - I've got to know, so that... - Did you see Sidney? Sidney! Thank Mr Johnson for the lovely party. Have you had a chance to talk? - Who turned out the lights? - Hey, turn the lights on! Happy birthday to you - JJ! - Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Hazel Happy birthday to you - Make a wish! - Shhh! - I can't! - You've gotta make a wish! You wish. You make a wish, Alva. Oh, Sal! Sally, it's my birthday! I'm 43 years old! It's a damn shame, Haze. Have a beer. What slob remembered, anyway? - Come on, Alva, it's your turn! - Make a wish, Alva. - Wish it up, Alva! - OK. - Hey, Alva, how about a birthday kiss? - Oh, hey! That's enough for you, Hank, boy! How about one for me? - Here's one to grow on! - Here comes old Sidney, wandering in. Wouldn't you like a piece of cake? I'd just love some. - What kind of work will you do here? - Who was that blowing out the candles? Oh, that's my sister Alva. She's the main attraction. You say you do or didn't work with the railroad? Well, I didn't say. Okey-doke? Okey-doke. It's hot out there! It's just practically like breathing fire. Just been dying for a piece of ice. Oh! My, that's cooling! If not the railroad, what do you do? Willie! Let the gentleman eat his supper in peace. Who's stopping him? You don't even know him. - My name is Owen Legate, ma'am. - My name's Alva Starr. Two R's in Starr. - He's from New Orleans. - Oh! - I've been to New Orleans. - When? - As a child. - First I heard of it. - Wonderful party, Alva. Much obliged. - We're just delighted. - Bye now. See you later. - Here's your cake, Alva. Thank you, Sidney. - Your mama said to fill up the beer tub. - It's in the icebox. OK. - You're the new boarder, huh? - Yeah. You gonna be looking for work around here? We ain't got none. That's all right, I'm not looking. - We ain't got no work. - He ain't looking. He just told you. - I want him to know there ain't none. - He knows. See you later. If you're not looking for work, what are you doing here? Now, I said stop asking questions and let him eat his dinner in peace. OK. - Thank you. - That's all right. They're all so nosy! What are you doing here? Mama says what are you doing back here and Mr Johnson's leaving. You tell your mama that after all the dancing I done tonight with Sidney, I am resting and unavailable. Sidney took you dancing? Where to? Oh, no place much. - Just the Peabody Hotel. - The Peabody Hotel! Sidney took you all the way to the Peabody Hotel in Memphis? Wow! - Did he buy you dinner? - Willie, you don't start with dinner. They have cocktails or highballs. Or French champagne, which is sweet and exceedingly bubbly. And when you drink it and start dancing, the whole place, with its diamond-crystal chandeliers and the waiters in the red jackets and the menus with tassels on them, all get dizzy and shaky, like it'll all come down on you. But you have to hide it and so you say, "Tipsy? I'm not the slightest bit tipsy. "It is just your magnificent dancing makes me breathless!" Then he stops and holds your blushing, soft face in his hands and he says: "Miss Starr, Miss Willie Starr, "surely you are the most beautiful creature I have ever seen." That the same Peabody Hotel in Memphis where they have the alligators and ducks swimming in that pond in the lobby? Yes, the very same one. Yeah, I'd like to see that. Thank you for the supper, Willie. I'd like to see how they stop the alligators eating the ducks in that little pond that they all swim in. Makes you think... doesn't it? Smart Alec! Hey, Alva. What you so grumpy about? Nothing. I just need some air. Hey, Max. Max! You taking me home? I can't. I got an early run tomorrow. My goodness, there isn't any breeze out here, either. Just like Papa used to say, if the breeze does not come from the river, it just is not a breeze. Hey, Alva... - Goodnight, Alva. - Thanks for the party. Goodnight. Hey, Alva... That's the Hummingbird Express. It surely is a long train. What? It's a long train. And an empty one. You know, that train is going to New Orleans. God, I'd like to get out of here and see a place like New Orleans. Alva, maybe you could. I think more than any place in the whole world, I'd like to go there. Get out of this place, this sad old house. It's gonna fall apart anyway. And go to New Orleans. Maybe when it's Mardi gras. I just wish sometimes that old express would jump off those old tracks, right up here, right through the grass, right through me and carry me off to points unknown. I'd better go on in now, Sidney. Are you all right? I'm all right. I just can't find a cool place. It's just as hot outside as it is in here. I'm going to bed. Willie... ...how come you've put Mr Legate in Papa's room? Mama told me to. Goodnight. Goodnight. Willie, you in there? Willie! - I don't think Willie's here. - Excuse me. I thought she might be. Nope. Well, goodnight. Goodnight. I've never been to the Peabody Hotel. - Neither have I. - They do have ducks in the lobby. So I'm told, but no alligators. Certain times they do run the ducks up and down the halls. I know that to be a fact. And the menus do have a tassel on them. There was a man brought me one once. Besides, I felt like I was there and that's just as good as being there. Not exactly. Do you know there was a cat once who fell asleep in the sun and dreamt that he was a man who fell asleep and dreamt he was a cat. When he woke up, he didn't know whether he was a man or a cat. Goodness! I don't know how you'll sleep with that streetlight shining in your eyes. I'd better tell Mama to get a new shade in the morning. Thank you. You know, if you concentrate on this thing, you can just about think it's February and it won't be so hot. When my Papa was here, hot summer nights, we used to sit together and pretend we got inside there. I'd practically have to get out my fur-lined gloves. You wanna try? You got an extra pair? - And some flannel underwear? - You made a rhyme! Give me a dime. Well, that tells a lot about you, that you have a poetic nature. - I have a poetic nature, too. - I noticed that. What else have you noticed about me, Mr Legate? You don't have to answer. I'm not interested in compliments. What else? You know, I am a very important person in Dodson, Mississippi. - Is that so? - Plus, I have been to Biloxi. - I'm even famous in my own way. - I don't doubt that. - Lots of men think I'm beautiful. - Listen, Miss Starr... ...l've been travelling since six this morning. Gotta get up early tomorrow and do some work. If you come with the room, and with the two meals, then let's get on with it. - Let's not play around. - What do you think I am? What do you think you are? I hope you suffocate! Hey, Alva. Goodnight now. - What's the matter? - Don't turn the light on, honey. Crazy doll's hair needs washing. I'm scared to do it, though. Head might come unglued where she got that compound fracture of the skull. I think most of her brains fell out. - Come on, Hazel. - You never stop. My birthday's over. Go along to my room. I'll be right there. Mama, don't turn the light on. It just makes it hotter. You been crying? You just go and take your dress off and I'll cool you down. There. Now, you lay still. Mr Johnson speak to you about tomorrow night? Feel that evaporating? Doesn't that feel good? Were you nice to Mr Johnson, honey? Yes, Mama. I wouldn't like it if he got dissatisfied and moved out right now. Nobody but a conductor can afford to pay what he does for that big old north room. I wanna go away, Mama. - Maybe to New Orleans. - I know you do, honey. We all do, and we're going to. But not right now. You can't tell what those old fools'll do if they're sweet on a pretty girl like you. Maybe you'll get off with a Packard car! Wouldn't that be something else? I'd just love to drive up in a Packard car and see that Sally. I'd say, Miss Snotty, you were so damn cute about your Chevrolet roadster. What do you think about my little car? I can just see Sally's face now. Plop! All those bags would just drop right into that double chin. Plop! - You feeling better, honey? - I'm feeling better, Mama. Well... sleep tight... ...and don't let the bed bugs bite. Willie, you just stop playing possum and go to sleep. I am asleep, Mama. Alva... ...what does Mardi gras mean? Mardi gras means carnival. I'm gonna go next year, even if I have to ride the rails. I'm gonna design my own costume... ...out of black shiny sequins, so that my skin'll look white against it and I'll glitter when I walk, sparkle when I dance with all those men in masks. And I'll never know who they are. And they'll never know who I am. And I'll dance and dance and dance. When people die in New Orleans, they bury them above the ground. Did you know that, Willie? Willie? - Hey! How are you? - Are you going down to the yards? - Yes. - Well, I can sneak you in. - No. No, I can manage, thank you. - Well, I'm a good guy to know. - What about Vacation Bible School? - What about it? The refreshments stink. Anyway, boy, have I got a hangover! You didn't see me last night, but I drank the whole of Alva's beer. - You're headed for ruin, you know? - Oh, I know. Know what the Orientals say? "A man takes a drink, the drink takes a drink, the drink takes the man." Could be. Took my Papa all right, right out of Dodson. Maybe it'll do the same for me. - I gotta get some cigarettes. - Oh, OK. I'll wait. - Can I help you, sir? - Luckies and two strawberry cones. Miss Starr! Where's that sister of yours this fine day? - Get away from me. - You ask Alva. What'll she do with that hot stuff once the line closes? Alva's got better things to do than waste her time on you! Look what I got! Listen, Miss Uppity! Once that line shuts down, she'll have to start looking for somebody. And I'll tell you, she'll have to crawl! You'll never get Alva and that line ain't never closing! You hear that, Tiny? She really tells a story! - Who are you? - A friend of Willie's. You're drumming up trade for Alva now? Yeah, I guess that's what the ice-cream cones are for. Go and wash up, boy. Your face is dirty. Just you wait, mister! I'll get you! What are you laughing about? Old Lindsay Tate just standing there! - I hear strawberry's good for hangovers. - Boy! He's just a plain damn mess! - You sure are tough. - I sure am. If you hadn't come out, I'd have killed him. - Not afraid of nothing, are you? - Nope. What if everything was to change? I mean, say something happened and Dodson changed overnight. - Dodson ain't never gonna change. - No, but what if it did? How did you know strawberry was my favourite? You look like a strawberry girl to me. What do you think of my sister Alva? She hates strawberry. I suspect your sister's a mighty potent force. She don't think much of you, neither. She says you're a smart Alec. See you later. I gotta work. Oh, OK... Hey! - Thanks for the ice-cream cone. - You bet. Step on a crack, break your mother's back. Step on a crack, break your mother's back. - Mr Knopke? - Yes. - My name is Legate. - I was hoping you'd be somebody else. Sit down. Hey, JJ, what do you think? Well... ...I just don't know. Come on, pump that thing. We always done what was asked. You can't trace no breakdowns to Dodson. To the bale, here's what we were railroading through here in '30. - This is what's going through here now. - How about this year's crop? Who'll pick them, Mr Knopke? You? Thirty-five cents a hundred pounds? - How many trains they taking off? - We'll start at three. - How many men? - 15. Maybe more. I'm gonna want a list of the names, the dates that they came on and I'd like to know who's married and who has kids. You won't be popular at the Starr Boarding House. I know. I've been not very popular before. Southern Pacific, CB & O, C & E... - Hey! - Hi. - Where are you going? - Mama said I gotta make the beds. Willie! He made it himself. - You skipped Vacation Bible School. - He bought me an ice cream. Strawberry? Did he... make any mention of me? No, not much. Nothing? Well, not after I told him you thought he was a smart Alec. - Willie, you didn't! - You said he was. I don't care! You tell him different, you hear? OK, OK. You stuck on him, Alva? No. Well, I don't think you should be. Not after what he said about you. Why? What did he say about me? He said he suspects you're a mighty potent force. - He did? - You mean it could be good? Well, it could be. Alva, how many times have you done it? Willie Starr! Five? Ten maybe? - Whoever said I done it at all? - Lindsay Tate. - Well, I never did it with Lindsay Tate! - That's probably why he's so sore. Afterward, do they love you? I guess they're supposed to. Does it look like Lindsay Tate loves me, screeching my name all over town? No. - I bet you Owen Legate... - I'm gonna knock your teeth in! Actually, Mr Owen Legate doesn't mean a thing in my life. Just a nothing dream I won't remember after I'm married. - You gonna get married? - Well, some day. - To Mr Johnson? - No, dummy! Willie, I haven't met him yet. When I do, he'll say to me: "Miss Starr, Miss Alva Starr, I love you and I'm gonna carry you away "and build a house lined in white satin for you to rest in between our dancing." You didn't have to make up your own bed, Mr Legate. It's force of habit, Willie. Besides, I like to. Well, I gotta finish making up the beds. Willie's got a crush on you. - Must be the strawberry ice cream. - I don't like strawberry. I know. Excuse me. I've got a million things to do. Miss Starr... ...I thought the paperweight belonged to my room. It's Papa's room. She in her room? I'll take a look if you want me to, Mr Johnson. And would you be kind enough to see that she gets this? Sure, Mr Johnson. - Tell her I'm waiting here. - OK. - You'll look so pretty. Which ring? - I don't want either. I'm not going. - Of course you are! - Present for Alva from Mr Johnson. - Let's see what this is. - Mama, it's for me! It's exciting. I told you Mr Johnson would come across with something good! 24 carats! That's not what I meant, or what I want. Willie, run and tell him your sister's rushing and will be down momentarily. I am not! Willie, please! I know you want other things, nice things. And you'll get them. Stand. Enriching travel... And your mama's gonna see that you get them, too. - Please don't make me go! - Memphis, New Orleans, New York... Think of the people you'll meet, the men. Right now, we gotta think of the practical aspect, the way things are looking now. Gotta make use of the things at hand. And one of the things at hand is Mr Johnson. Sit down. All I'm asking is a little bit of niceness to him for the time being. - But, Mama...! - Now, that ain't gonna hurt you... is it? - Can your sister still be getting dressed? - Guess so, Mr Johnson. You'd better go upstairs and tell her it's getting late. I just came down from telling her it was getting late! Let me by, JJ. - Here I am! - You shouldn't have hurried. - You look just fine. - Do you mind? That light attracts all kind of things. Moths, bugs, bats... I haven't finished my hair. Funny about my hair. I just pile it up and it all comes crumbling down. - Willie, why not sing for Mr Johnson? - I already did. Besides, I wanna go catch some fireflies. - Alva, did you like the bracelet? - Oh, yes. It's just lovely. It's too lovely for you to give to me. - Did you get it in New Orleans? - Marshall Field's in Chicago. A gift of gold is a gift of seriousness. A gift of gold is for your wife, Mr Johnson. Perhaps I should explain about my wife. My wife is an invalid. I see her maybe once in a month. She's in a nursing home near Baton Rouge. Mr Johnson, I'd love a Coke with lots of ice in it. Would you be an angel? Yeah, sure, Alva, sure. What did you put in the mailbox? Something for me? - Or is it none of my business? - That's right. Hey... did you ever see a scarecrow with red hair? - No. - Come on. I travel a lot, too. - You didn't lie. - I don't lie. What is it? I don't know. I just... Sometimes I have trouble catching my breath. Maybe when God breathed life into all of us, he didn't breathe enough into me. Or maybe it's running around in the night without your shoes. Oh, the ground is warm. Don't you know there's a fire in the centre of the earth? It burns for all eternity. And up there it's so cold it's 100,000 degrees below zero. Look! There's a falling star! Quick! Make a wish! - Aren't you gonna ask what I wished? - They don't come true if you tell. Did you make a wish? No. Bye-bye to a rare chance. My papa made him. This used to be his garden. It's a ghost garden now. - What... what did he do? Just leave? - He's gone to find a greener pasture. Mama says it's a laugh, unless they give land to the man with the reddest hair. You ever hear from him? No. He's coming back, though. 'Cause if he loves us, he surely will come back. Supposing he doesn't? He will. He could be on any train, with the deed to greener pastures. Is that what you're waiting for, Alva? Alva. Owen, do you know that's the first time you have used my familiar name? - Here's your Coke! - Don't let him know where we are! - Alva! - Get down, get down! Your ice is melting! Alva, where are you? - Why not tell him to leave you alone? - Well, Mama says... - He's a kind man. - He's an old man. We'll be late. He's a very lonely old man whose wife isn't well. I hate to hurt his feelings. - It wouldn't be grateful. - Or good business. Where are you? You are in a cruel, teasing mood and I don't understand. I'm talking about thanks and niceness, common politeness. Common politeness? That old man, as you call him, happens to be a gentleman who appreciates me. Tonight, he gave me a solid gold bracelet from a very expensive store in Chicago. What did you give this kind old man in return? My company and my kindness! Those are the bare uninteresting facts. - It makes him very happy. - What does it make you? People thinking I'm beautiful doesn't mean I'm their property! If you really thought you were beautiful, you'd be your own girl. I am my own girl, Mr Legate. I don't need some smart Alec to point out the error of my ways! I go out with him because I want to and because he treats me like a lady. - Because your mama tells you to. - I enjoy it! I'm not a cat dreaming I'm a man. That happens to be the truth! Then why are you hiding out here in the dark? Alva, where are you? There you are. I thought you'd gone on without me. The ice has melted. Thank you, Mr Johnson, and thank you for the solid gold charm bracelet! - You're gonna keep it? - I accept your gift with gratitude. Where are your shoes? What time was that reservation for, Mr Johnson? - They've held the table since seven. - You hear? They've held your table since seven. You've got to get ready! You two'll have a high old time. All right, Mama. We'll all have ourselves a high old time. I'm not getting dressed and going to the casino. I've changed my mind. I'm getting undressed and going to the railroad hole. Who wants to skinny dip? - Yeah! - You're probably not coming, right? No, thank you. What's the matter? Scared to take your clothes off? Owen! I've been waiting to tell you. I got it wrong before. - Alva didn't call you no smart Alec. - The hell I didn't! - Alva's going... Let's all go! - You can never tell what she'll do. It's a good idea, though, ain't it, Mr Johnson? Come on! Last one in is a skinny old maid! Come on, Alva! Take your clothes off, Mr Johnson. Come on in. Nobody's gonna look. Can't swim. Wish me a rainbow Wish me a star Why aren't you with the rest of them? I'm right where I wanna be. Well, let me go. - I know what you want. I know you. - I'll scream for Mama! Go ahead. What's the matter with you? You saving up for that spotter? - What are you talking about? - Your friend, who's here to lay us all off. - I don't believe you. - He's got a pocket full of pink slips. - Are you saving it all up for him? - That's not true! Why don't you ask him? - Willie isn't here. - You were wrong before, Mr Legate. What you put in the mailbox is my business! Come on in. You come here lying, flying false colours, tricking this whole house! - What is it you think you know? - I know you! Liar! - That I'm laying men off? - For good! No more money coming in! - There's a depression. - I hear! - The railroad's cutting back. - Don't just blame it on them! - I don't whip myself. It's not my idea. - But you do it! What do you care about lay-offs? Isn't this what you want? To get out of here? There are others concerned. Willie and my mama! - Your mama can take care of herself. - That's not your business! - You must've wanted to tell me off bad. - I did! You need telling off! - Anxious to get back now, aren't you? - Yes, I am! And I'm going! I meant every word I said! - False colours? Tricking you? - Yes! Yes! - Liar? - Yes! Yes! Liar! You get yours, Sid? Yeah. Me, too. Any idea what you're gonna do now, boy? I'll sleep late in the morning. Sidney? Sidney! You like your job, mister? There's a man with a trucking line out of Mobile. Anybody that's interested, I could talk to him. He's taking on some new men. And in answer to your question, no, mister, I don't like my job. Being a fink is thirsty work. How much, operator? And I thought he was so swell. But he is a fink, isn't he? I don't know, Willie. I just don't know. - This the last of it? - For now. You want some lunch? Not with you. All right. We'll finish this this afternoon. Then I'll be out of here tomorrow. - Y'all having lunch? - No. Fresh air. - You oughtn't to be here. - That's what I kept telling myself. - I don't think those men will like... - I know. Hey! - Ooh! They call this fainting weather. - What? When it's heavy and close like this, only some call it hurricane weather. You leaving tomorrow? Why did you come down here today? I don't know. I just wanted to see you. - And besides... - Watch it. ...l've something to show you. I mean, something special. Just ahead. - What time are you leaving tomorrow? - 10.20. To New Orleans? That's right. Hey... is it really true they bury people above the ground in New Orleans? If they didn't, the graves would flood. I suppose the worst part of being buried underground is being unable to breathe. I don't suppose you ever had that feeling... not being able to breathe. - No. - How could you? You've never been stuck any place. Hey, look! Come on! See that star right underneath the seven? - That's my papa's signature. - That's quite a signature. - Did he paint all of these cars like this? - Oh, no. He used to dream pretty big, my papa, and make big promises. He never kept them, except once. Come on. Come on! All for me. With a gift card, even, saying: "Hail, my heart's delight, and farewell." Sit down. The train'll be leaving soon. The porter must have known we were coming and dusted our seats with talcum, lilac talcum. Do you feel bad? About the men, I mean. No. - Don't you? - No. I can't let myself feel bad. I do this in every city that I go into. It's my job. But you do feel bad. You have to smile on the Honeydew Express or the wheels won't turn. Oh! Excuse me. I think they ought to have some system to warn ladies when they're pulling out. What are you looking at? There's nothing there... only me. - You don't have to pretend... - Look how white the sky is! It's perfectly white. Just as white as a clean piece of paper. Listen to the wind. It scares me. My papa gave me those. I never take them off. Alva, listen... - When a train goes, know what it says? - "Bromo-seltzer, bromo-seltzer..." You are staring straight into my eyes, which is impolite. I leave tomorrow, Alva. "Bromo-seltzer, bromo-seltzer..." Listen... Nights at Starr's have little to do with the days. Meals are included... - Stop it! ...and modern facilities... Do you know, if you pinch your elbow you can't even feel it? Alva, do you understand what I'm telling you? Yes, I know. You're leaving. Alva, the sky is not white, it's blue. If you pinch your elbow hard enough, it hurts like hell. This is not lilac talcum on these seats, this is dust! There is no wind in this car. As a matter of fact, it's hot. Because this car has been sitting here for years. - I don't care. - Why do you do that? Why are you so fanciful? Why do you make everything seem so special? Because it is. No. Well, lots is. You are, what you do... No. No, I'm not. My job, it's not always lay-offs, but it's somehow always the same. - But you travel. - Between cities that are the same. But you live in New Orleans, on Bourbon Street. That's your dream. It's not mine. Then, what is yours? I have no dream. How terrible for you. Maybe. Are you cold? No. No, it's... like the snowstorm. What? You know, in the glass ball. - Well, isn't it almost? It is. - You're never gonna change. I don't wanna think about you leaving. I don't care if it's true. - But I am. It is true. - I'd rather pretend you're not leaving. - But you... - Please! Let's pretend, just for tonight, that you're not leaving. - Cry-baby. - But it was so sad. You know, sometimes when I see a sad movie, I want to see the end again, just hoping it'll all come out better the second time. No use. No matter how many times they show it, she dies in the end. Wouldn't it be wonderful if she didn't? What if you went to see it again and the end was totally different? I mean, like if his folks did like her and she didn't die. Yeah, but think how unhappy you'd be, though. You couldn't cry in the end. When you get back to New Orleans, how long will you be there? Open your mouth. How long? Until they send me out again. A month maybe, a week, couple of days. - I don't think... - Well, I... - Well, I just... - I didn't really think... JJ! What are you doing? - Stop pulling my hair out! - Stop it! - Stop it! You're gonna kill him! - Get out of here! Quit it! I said, quit it! You hear me? - Stop it! - Quit it! - Stop it! - I said, quit it! You bastards! No! I'm fine. No. - No! - Can't you let me help you? Let me... - Damn! - Shhh! Don't go. Do you know how far it is to New Orleans? It's 247 railroad miles. That doesn't sound too far, does it? Hop and a skip. And a jump over mama. Mama? I could go. I could go. Still you're here in Dodson. If you don't believe me, who in the world will? You're staring again. I... What? What? What? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Alva, you in there? I know you're in there! Open up! My God! You didn't even have sense enough to lock the door, you and that rat. - Where is he? - At the station. Thank God. He's coming back. To say goodbye. - Where are you going? - What is it, Mama? I don't think it's got through to you yet what's going on around here. I had a long, serious, satisfying conversation with Mr Johnson yesterday. - We are leaving. - Who's leaving? You, Willie and me! We're going to Memphis and I don't want any worries. I am in no mood for worries. We're setting up in Memphis on a little loan Mr Johnson advanced to us. You are going and that is final! I am not going! Alva! Now, you listen to me! You been living like a damn princess while I ran this place! Did nothing while I took care of everything! The boat has docked and you're gonna show me that you're not just the spoiled, lazy, moody princess your papa left me with. Mama, you can talk and talk, but I'm not gonna go. You don't seem to understand me. Our one chance to survive is this loan. If we have to stand on our heads to get it, we'll do it smiling! - Is that clear? - Yes, Mama. If there's one thing I loathe, it's that innocent virgin look you put on your face! I'm not going! And just what the hell do you think on doing? I don't know. I'll get out of here and get a job. - Not that old stuff again. - I'm getting out here! Alva, I am sick to death of your nonsense! Let's face facts. For years, I've watched you fool with every man and boy... - Mama, please! ...who pleased you and I said nothing. Now, when I ask you to do me one tiny favour, you play innocent. - Tiny! What are you saying? - You are selfish! Selfish, selfish, selfish! Your papa saw where you were headed. Think you fooled him? Not for a minute! - He knew you were selfish and vicious! - What are you talking about? He used to say, "She'll turn on you, leave you and let you down! "You just wait and see, Hazel. That ungrateful girl will break your heart!" - He never said that! He never said that! - Don't break my heart! Help me, Alva! What about Willie? If you don't care about me, what about Willie? - God, Mama! - It wouldn't be forever with Mr Johnson. I am asking you to give him a few short, tiny weeks out of your life, till I get the house in Memphis straight so he can't pull out. Nobody's gonna know. Alva, please, look at me! I am begging you! Get up, please! Please! Just get up! Oh, honey, you're not gonna regret it. I promise you. You're not gonna... Hey, Owen! Wait a minute! - Hi, old Willie. What is it? - You leaving? Yeah, as soon as I pick up my bag from the house. Bye. Goodbye. You won't worry about me, will you? - Some, maybe. - Okey-doke. - Okey-doke. - Bye. Bye. Mr Legate. One way, New Orleans. Why get a ticket? You got your pass. That's right. Sure I do, Sal, sure I feel bad about it. You know, Sally, they can lay off the whole of Dodson for all I care, including the sheriff. I swear, I'll never again set foot in a town with less than 100,000 population. I got the feeling that I and Memphis are gonna get along just fine... Who? Sure Alva's going to Memphis. She's just wild to go, just like I told you. Well, of course I'm happy. And Mr Johnson's happy and JJ's happy. I think we'll all have ourselves a ball. Thanks, Sal. I knew you would. See you! Morning. - You really are a liar. - What is it? - No. No damn games! - What games? - You really like to play with it! - What is it? - What's happened? - Ask mama what's happened! - Telling dreams. It's how you make love. - What are you talking about? It's what makes Alva different than the other tramps! - Don't... don't say what can't be fixed. - Let me ask you a question. How much does a ticket to New Orleans cost? Turn it in for one to Memphis. You wonder about other things, other ways to live, you wonder and dream, but you go on doing what you do. That railroad carriage is enough for you. That snowstorm. Fake! But it's enough for you because you're a fake, Alva! You're not unique. You're not even special. You're just... peculiar. What in hell did I think was so magical or fanciful... ...about a little whore who is just a little bit peculiar? How about a big hand for Odel Otis and his Kansas City Steaks, playing for your dancing enjoyment at the Moonlake Casino. I used to wonder if I was annoying you by always asking you out. Oh, God, no! I love to go out. Alva, your mama said I'd see a lot of you in Memphis. You gonna mind? Why should I mind, Mr Johnson? That's ridiculous. Well, you know I'm married, Alva, but I'm a lonesome man. It makes me feel good to have someone so young, so pretty as you around. - Oh, I know it. - I don't expect anything lasting. I could get you a place of your own in Memphis, an allowance, so you'd only have to do what you felt like. Lawdy, Miss Glawdy! You two look nice and cosy. - Is that hard liquor you're drinking, Alva? - Yeah, that's hard corn liquor, Mama. - Just about as hard as your heart. - You certainly are celebrating, honey. Yeah. Sit down. We'll have a toast and I'll make it. - Alva, you are loaded. - Yeah! I'm loaded like a pistol. Y'all fill your glasses, hear? Alva's gonna make a toast. Now, the occasion of this toast is the matter of getting out of here! I'll drink to that! Memphis, here we come! - Isn't that funny, Mama? - What? I was just thinking maybe I wouldn't get settled down with you in Memphis at all. 'Cause Mr Johnson here, has just made me this very attractive proposal. Well, it's not exactly a proposal, is it, Mr Johnson? But it's very attractive. 'Cause he's gonna take care of me. Set me up in my own little apartment. - Isn't that nice, Mama? - Behave yourself. You'll make me blush. - Mr Johnson, shame on you! - What's the matter, Mama? Scared if I get away there'll be no more men around to have a good time with? - I don't think we wanna talk about that. - JJ, you sticking around when I'm gone? You gonna stick around with her if you don't have me to look at? She's drunk. Our little arrangement about the house is what she wants. She'd tell you if she wasn't drunk. Wait! - I'll dance with you, JJ. - You just... Wanna dance with me? Or with Mama? Who do you want, JJ? Who would you rather have? Tell her who you'd rather dance with, JJ. - You been feeding her too much booze. - Tell her how bad you want me, JJ! Now, you just cut that out! That fellow Owen's got you all upset. He was gonna take me away with him. Oh, Mama, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'll take care of you, Alva. Oh, shut up! Mama knows you want me, Mr Johnson, but she didn't know about JJ, did you? Do you still want me, JJ? Do you? What about that fellow Owen? - He's gone, ain't he, Mama? - Yeah, he's gone. He's just gone! He went away. What do you want? I wanna go away. - I'll take you. - What? - You mean it? - I'll take you. - But, Alva... - No, that isn't enough. You gotta marry me, JJ. - I'll marry you. - JJ, you crazy? You shut up. - I'll marry you, Alva. - No! I mean right now! I mean tonight, right now! Sure, Alva, I'll marry you. You have that habit... of staring. I'm sorry. I missed you, Alva. I didn't know I would. New Orleans is not a place where a person needs to feel the pain of separation for long. You, Miss Starr, were a missed person. I was? Deeply missed. And you'll stay... ...and you'll stay... ...because of all you give me. Do I? Thoughts I never had. And things... ...such things. What are you gonna do all day? Wait for you to come home. Owen. I'll have supper ready in just a second. - They're golden! - Well, almost. By the way, my section chief Macferson told me something of no interest. What? Even though I'm not interested. He said that there was a job opening for some dull young man. Too bad we don't know any. Is it a travelling job? No, no. It's a stay-put job. - Chicago. - Well, did he offer it? - Well, they call it a feeler. - What did you say? Well, I said I'd have to ask my wife. What's the matter? I am asking my wife. I thought I saw Willie today. - Where? - In the street. Just a flash. Dumb hair all over her face. Wearing one of my old dresses. It was crazy... It was just another dumb little kid. - Where do you think Willie is? Dodson? - She could be anywhere. - Wherever Mama is. - Well, I can find out. I can write to Knopke. He's still on. We can send for Willie. We could take her with us to Chicago. Would that please you, Alva? Oh, dear! I'd love to see Willie take Chicago. - For a girl who's afraid of the thunder... - Well, I was just passing by. Come on in, honey. - Mama! - Oh, you come right in. You are soaked to the bone. I hope you don't mind my making myself at home. You never did know when to lock up. Take off that wet coat. You'll catch your death. - How did you find us? - Willie showed me Alva's postcard. You look cold, too. I made some coffee. - Please don't tell him! - Grab me those cups. - I don't know what he'll do if you tell him. - I don't know what you mean. - Please! - Where's the sugar? Mama, I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! - Believe me I am! - It's all right, honey. Now we need milk. Mama, if you tell Owen, it'll just kill him, I swear it! You haven't even asked me how I'm feeling. Don't you care about me? He wants to marry me. This coffee's getting cold. In we go. Nice little place here, honey. Did you help him fix it up? - Did you come here to pour coffee? - I hear you're thinking of marrying Alva. - That's right. - You weren't going to tell me about it? - It's between Alva and me. - I thought so. I had an idea you weren't a man who'd want his wife's mama helping out. You got it right. - How's the coffee? - It's fine... ...just fine. You drink it up and put your coat on. We got things to do, places to go. - What? - I'm not licked yet. Mr Johnson finally turned sour. I've got one or two schemes up my sleeve. She's not going anywhere. - Oh, no? - No. Not unless it's with me. You have nothing to say about it. She's not yours. Didn't you tell him? - Get out! - It must have slipped her mind. That little girl's all wrapped up. She and JJ got married. The next morning, she went through his pockets and rolled him. You never quite give up, do you? Tell him, Alva! - Oh, my God... - What? Oh, my God! Alva! Alva! Mama ran off with a man named Sam and they went somewhere in Arkansas. Papa, he never did come back. You know where Alva is now? - New Orleans? - No. - Chicago? - No. - Memphis? - You'll never guess. Where is she, then? - She's in the bone orchard. - What? Bone orchard, cemetery, graveyard! Don't you understand English? - That's pretty tough. - You don't know the half of it, buddy. Her lungs got affected. Did you see that movie at the Delta Brilliant last fall? Which is what Alva died of. Lung affection. Only, the way she had it in the movie, it was very beautiful. You know, violins playing, all her lovers come back in a beautiful scene. Wish me a rainbow Wish me a star I'm going back now. I'm gonna live for a long, long time, like my sister. When my lungs get affected, I'm gonna die like she did, with all my rings and my gold charm bracelet from Marshall Field's. And then, I guess, somebody else'll inherit all my beaux. The sky sure is white. - Well, so long. - So long. Wish me a rainbow and wish me a star All this you can give me Wherever you are And dreams for my pillow And stars for my eyes And a masquerade ball Where our love wins first prize Wish me red roses And yellow balloons Black sequins whirling To gay dancing tunes I want all these treasures The most you can give So wish me a rainbow As long as I live
