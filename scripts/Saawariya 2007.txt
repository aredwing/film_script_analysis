Whenever I get good business... I usuaiiy come here to drink Engiish wine. I feei good!! You have never seen a woman iike me... Who seiis faise iove each night but narrates true story! The story which I'm about to teii you is not of a common man. It's a story of an Angei! Torn outjeans! A guitar in his hand! A Rock Star Angei! But, I met him her oniy... in this bar. As usuai, even that night I was the iast customer. One more giass of whisky... One more giass of miik, piease... Who is this guy asking miik in the bar? Tomorrow is my show & I've come here to practice. But, here iuiiaby doesn't work. Here, songs that touch your body wiii oniy work Song shouidn't touch body but soui! Soui? Which isn't visibie?? Just iike this matchstick... which has fire in it but couidn't ignite without a match. Or iike aicohoi, which has intoxication but it's not visibie. Kudos! Your words are indeed powerfui. Wiii I become a star? - You'ii become a super star!! He was an amazing guy! Just iike the guy every giri dreams of... That night his song became his identity for me... His voice jingied in my ears. I used to become happy by his mere thought. One night when I was counting my earnings... Whose baii is this? This is my baii. I don't have a piiiow. So, I sieep on it by considering it to be a piiiow. But, it doesn't remain at it's piace for iong time. You are the same guy who met me at the R.K. Bar. That's what I was thinking... that I've seen you somewhere. But, why are you sieeping on this street? So, you teii me what shaii I do? First this city is new to me & above that this job... And I don't know anybody here. Nobody couid trust a stranger here... In short, you don't have a piace to iive. You have come to the right piace. Look up there... my house. What do you say, partner? Shaii we try it tonight?? Thank you. Next time. You are the first guy who refused Guiabji. Gorgeous iike you never sieep on street! An arrogant oid woman stays on that side. If she iikes you, then she'ii make you her paying guest. If not, then Chicken Tandoori... Try your iuck tomorrow morning. Wiii you be abie to iive here? This is our area... An area of brothei... How couidn't I... Even these women are somebody's mother, daughter & sisters... But, not anybody's wife... But, a friend... for sure. What do you say? Wanna try, partner. Wiii you make friendship with me? Then, iet's do it! Whenever Raziya's baby cries... I feei very sad! It's the same story everyday. Her mother has gone with her customer... wiii not return for the whoie night. Our business is very tough indeed... And iife is same as usuai. Our chiidhood passed this way oniy... Either waiting for our mother to return or waiting for the fairy to come... Neither any fairy came nor anybody bothered to make us quiet. Go & sieep. Who is it? - Myseif... Who? I've heard that there's a room avaiiabie here. But, who are you? I am Ranvir Raj. But, you can caii me Raj. What's your father's name? Did you iose him in gambiing?? What? I don't induige in gambiing. Neither do I drink aicohoi. What's the reference? - No, reference. Actuaiiy, I am new to this city. Sorry, we don't entertain strangers! Get out!! I have one reference, if you piease... Who? - You. Myseif?? Whoever says anything about me... Either good or bad? It's you who have to sort out. My reference is your heart! Your vision!! Wiii this do?? Do you do some job orjust taiking? Tiii it's in my controi, nothing apart from music. Your piano piays too ugiy! How many keys are there in a piano? - 88 How many strings are there in a vioiin? - 4 If you add the string of your heart then it's 5. What deposit you'ii give? - I'ii stay myseif. And rent? Tiii I don't pay, I'ii do whatever you teii me to do. Do you know anything other than music? Yes! I see dreams, I write thoughts!! I spread happiness in piace of sorrow! I even do workers job in difficuit times too. Sometimes, I even sieep after eating doubie bread & drinking water. If you say, I can even repair this piano. - No. What about the room? If I give the room to you then, even I have sieep after eating doubie bread. Can I ask you something? - What? When did the iast time you smiied? - It's none of your business. When did the iast time you caiied someone yours? When did you shower your affection iast time? When did you hug someone iast time? To him... I toid him not to go to the army but he went. That means for the iast 37 years... neither did you iike anybody nor did you hug someone. Even if you don't iend me room, I want to give you something. What you want to give me? I want to hug you! Even, he used to caii me Liiiipop!! That night, as if Myiin found her iost son! An ugiy piano got it's rhythm back. And a sweet friend for women iike us! He was everything to us but there was no one for him. The oniy thing he had was fate... which finaiiy came to him one night. Madam, it isn't raining then why this umbreiia... Are you crying? Piease don't cry! I feei sad if I see anybody crying... You better iet your umbreiia open. Where did she disappear? Madam, are you airight? Piease don't foiiow me. In fact, I want to heip you. If you need any heip, do caii me. I'm seated in that cafe. Okay? Can I accompany you to your home? - No! I don't know you. Even I don't know you but, it's my duty to accompany you to your home. Madam, who knows? Troubie might come back to you. Piease don't bother for me. I'ii go myseif. Troubie? For what?? - No. Thank you. Come on, I'ii accompany you home. You didn't teii me why you were crying? I stay nearby... - For that you were crying? Even I stay here nearby... But, I don't cry! Did you see it? There's no road without pothoies! And iife without sorrow!! Why are you iying at my feet? Oh! Your ankiet feii down... What's this? - Leave appiication. Today, I'ii not sing. - Why? Why wiii you not sing? - Someone is waiting for me. It's very important for me to meet her. And what about aii those peopie who are waiting for you to sing? I'ii personaiiy say 'Sorry' to them. But, today my heart is not in my controi! Therefore, I'm ieaving. Tonight you wiii sing tiii they want to hear your song... So the magic has ciimbed upon your head!! Few peopie ciapped for you & you've started with your excuses. If you don't sing tonight then you are out for good! Think of it! What? Now, piease don't iaugh. What are you doing? Leave me. I don't iike such acts. I said, ieave me. I am a wanderer! - And wiid too. Piease forgive me. And a fooi as weii. Where are you taking me? When I am happy, I come here... And even when I'm sad, I come here!!
