Dozens of people are feared dead and many more have been injured, after a packed commute train derailed, and... brought down a tunnel near Anno Hill a short time ago. Emergency services crews are working to free... people trapped in carriages beneath tons of rubble. Their efforts are being hampered by the collapse of the tunnel. and Australians face a scorching weekend with little relief before Monday. So, what are my chances? Look, I really don't think there's any point... in speculating that sort of way. A specialist will tell you more on Monday. What? Come on, what? I've got cancer. A skin cancer or something. Testicular cancer. And in my lungs, and I don't know where else yet. What does that mean? I don't know. You went for a travel medical! Sorry. -Now, don't laugh. Tell me where you're going. Which hospital? Everyone will cheap in, and we'll send some flowers or something. Look, you go home. I'll sort everything out here. Andy, can you do art story for this week? What's this? Do you know how many supposedly... accidental deaths could have been suicides? Over a hundred in this state. Do you know how many of those were men? - 76%. - Arts story. Do you know how many of those... were doing art story at the time of their accident? Please go to these things this time, because I find it lifts the tone of the pieces a lot, if the writer has some glimmer of knowledge. Macbeth. Andy Walker. Arts story. - Nick, - Yes? - That your rig, yes? - Yes. Good. No, I just... I just need to get home. Perfect. Someone's gone under a train right near your place. It's on the way. His dog was on the other side of the track. He called it, and... Then he heard the train, and he realized that the dog would come to him. And maybe get run over. He ran across to the dog, but... Then he tripped, and... I couldn't see anymore. Did you actually see him trip? Yes. Well, no. He must have tripped. It seemed like the train was going slowly, but there is the bend. And they don't go that slowly. It just kept coming, like... Like a freight train! Do you know this dog? Yes, it's my dog. What's your name? Julia. I'm up for off, mate. Did you get my slant? Guy could have tripped. Maybe. - See you tomorrow. - Yes? Cricket! Are you following me? No, I'm just stopping in the shops. - You want a hand with that? - No, it's fine, tank you. You've been on a holiday? - No, I've been to my parents' place. - That's nice. - My dad died. - Now, that's awful! I don't know. It's the natural order of things, isn't it? And there's always somebody worse off. You know, somebody whose mother or father... or brother have all died and their house burns down. - Sorry, I don't know what I'm talking. - It's the shock. Of course! Telling you my star sign next. - I'm just down here. - Oh, well... Maybe it was meant to be. He might have been a rapist axe murderer... about to commit his first crime, or something. Maybe the right thing happens. Cancer. My star sign. Anyway... Nice to meet you. Maybe it was meant to be. Jesus. Anna. You alright? You look great. What's that? It's the pregnancy test. Are you sure? Yes. I haven't seen you for a month. I know. - I've presumed I've been dumped, but... - I didn't dump you! I've been busy! I don't know how you can still smoke, doing what you do. Did you do this on purpose? Why would I do that? I don't want... I don't want a baby. I just thought you should know. Great. Now I know. Shockproof. Message received Friday at 8:12PM. I thought you would have got back to me by now. You really need to new illustrations to me by Monday morning. Will you not be able to reach it, that'll be it. - Hello. - Hi, it's me. Hi Lis, I go held up. How are things there? So mom's OK? She didn't mind me having gone? Well, I guess not. Just as well, I have to work on weekend or I might not have a job on Monday. Which should make it a clean sweep. Nothing of anything. - Are you alright? - I'm alright. You alright? Oh, that's nice. Nothing, I'm fine. I'm being stupid, I'm fine. I'm sick of this stupid job, and not having any money. I don't have my own home, I don't have children. I don't have a partner to share anything yet. And I don't have any yacht. And I've never been on a world cruise. And my sister ate all the smoke salmon sandwiches at the funeral. Twenty people are now confirmed dead and dozens more are missing, after a train derailed in the Anno Hill light night. Police fear the toll could get much higher... Did you get the beer? No! - They were your birthday surprise! - Birthday? - Happy Birthday! - Dad, it's tomorrow. I knew that. - How old? - Ten! You're ten! She's having a party tomorrow. Today she's cleaning her room. Yes. Why did you have to put that photo on the front page? It stuffed up the whole point of my article, it wasn't about her. It's about a guy jumping in front of a train. Right, jump, did he? - Did you even read it? - Of course I read it. It's great article. With great photo. There's a thousand great photos every bloody day. This was about a major social injustice. And if you wanted accident, then you've got bloody Anno Hills. There's twenty dead people down there. Have you spoken to Nick? No. I'm sure he'll be pretty happy about it, but you made me look like an idiot. This is not about you, Andy. - What's the matter with you? - There is nothing matter with me. Good! Don't worry about me. I'm not the kind of guy... to jump in front of a bloody train any time soon. I've still got important meaningful relevant work to do. I've got bloody arts story! Not even a good photo. Have you told him? I'm... Going to the hospital tomorrow. I've just got a bit of a... lump They got to cut it out. Jesus. Hi. It's a good photo. I'm sorry. if we... me and Andy, he was the journalist, I was with, if we... if we upset you yesterday. That's OK. I suppose everyone has to witness something ghostly one day. You know, your fifteen minutes of blah. Yeah, I guess. On your way home from a funeral. Your dad. Sorry. You weren't to know. Was he sick? Your dad. No, he just... turned to say something to mom, then fell over. dead before he hit the ground. Spent the morning watching the cricket. It's a good way to go. Mom wants to know what he was going to say. You know, maybe he was going to say something nice. But it's good to know that he didn't suffer. Did you want something? No, I don't know, no... I was going for a run. It was nice to see you again. Probably see you tomorrow. Sorry? You know, It's like when you buy a car... and then you see them everywhere all the time. Yes, right. I didn't realize you were home. I just came to feed the fish. - Did you just spill that? - Yes. Is that new? It's great. How was home? Did you meet any nice men? It was my dad's funeral! Ah, yeah. So, You're OK? Yeah. Yes, I'm OK, I just... hate my job. Yes, right. Try working in the front line welfare when you're seven months pregnant, and your supervisor thinks scorch or plaster... just don't motivate it. And then you get this phone call from hospital... saying you've got high blood pressure. And that you're going to have to be induced. So you spend the next six agonizing hours thinking that you're going to have a baby... smaller than your own hand. until they ring and say "Oops, oh sorry, wrong person." and you think "Fantastic!" Until you realize, of course, that IS actually someone. Don't get me started. I read your stars this morning, they're very good. Listen to this: Cancer: contrary to your usual belief, you do hold fate in your own hands. Cancer's always crap, what's Leo? They're always having good time. I saw that guy get run over yesterday. Which guy? That girl's guy. You saw that? You saw it. That's awful. Did you get cantsleep? - It's not as if I knew him. - Still. Thousand people I didn't know had probably died yesterday. Yes, but you didn't see them. I didn't actually see him die. Jesus Christ. What a way to go. I like her hair. Are you going swimming? - I should be working. - You need the exercise. Thanks. I meant for you head, not your thighs. Why choose to mention my thighs? I guess I'm just too polite to mention your top shape arms. Maggie! Very nice. Nice photo today, buddy. Front page. Then I guess you jet-sitting fancy free bustards need... that kind of constancy splashy reassurance, don't you? You'll probably win an award. Well, if you die. Which you might as well now. You took your one great photo? Yes. Train comes in, stupid bucks man walks out. I like the idea of an after-life. I haven't quite given up on Catholicism though. I'm a Buddhist this week. It starts being popular. Do you believe in god? How can anyone believe in something so bloody ridiculous? I mean this big guy in the sky looking down at the little eatty-bitty crap everyone's life's got, Now you're being bad! That's a sin! Can't do that, I'll throw you to hell! It's just such a crock! And most people they just have an even bet. You say you believe now, in case there is a heaven. And when if you get there, and there is no haven, who bloody cares, cause you're dead anyway, aren't you? Did you ever get anyone pregnant? No, Not that I know of. That's good. That you know of. That's just it, isn't it? Knowing. The prayer didn't work too well for him, did it? Last time Travers, do you hear me? The last time! She likes you. Do you have children? No. I don't. Do you want to bring her right here? I have been waiting for two hours. This is an emergency department, sir. It's no doctor-search room. We have to see the sickest child first. My child is sick! - But now the sickest here. - How would you know? - Do you have children? - No. Didn't think so. Damn! Anna, you don't have any children do you? You can work on the school holidays. Come on. - How's the game going? - Good. How are you doing? Good. Did you see the photo? Yes. Front page. It's a good photo. Good news. Finish up. Your job. For now. I mean... I think... Apparently... It's good to stay up. You know, optimistic. Shit. Cheers buddy! Thanks mate! What does this block mean? What's the matter with you? Sorry. For Jannes. I've already bought a present. -She wanted one. - Are you having an affair? - Yes. No. I've given up smoking. Kathy? A night of fun for two people leaves one... paying the bills for the rest of his life. While the other gets the house, the car, the kids... and affirmative action of the work place. How can you write stuff like that? Years of training. How dare you? I've never stopped you seeing the kids! It's not even about you, Kathy, or me. It's good journalism. Crap. And it was tabloid crap. I don't think kids can come to you tomorrow. - Maggie's broken her arm. - What?! How? When? She fell this morning at the pool. She slipped. Why didn't you call me? I am. Why didn't you call me when it happened? When I could have helped? You would have been at cricket. What's the matter with you? You didn't even want kids, remember? - And now you're gonna top yourself... - I don't want to top myself. Is she alright? - She's fine. - Nice. Then they can come to me tomorrow. Maggie, what are you watching? ...for survivors in the Anno Hills train smash, police have asked anxious relatives to stay away... Maggie, what happened to the settle clock? Come on, switch it off. Hi, Hello. Is this yours? I've grabbed it that day. You're an artist? Sort of. It's hot, isn't it? "We have no light promised us to show our road 100 miles away" "But we have the light for next footstep" "And If we take that we shall have a light for the one that is to follow." Are you a writer as well? God, no. But then mom got all these kind of cards for my dad and she cried. It's great. It's not great that she cried, but it's... It's great to paint things to make people feel better. Good. Do you like living around here? Yeah, I do. It's cheap. Artist... Poverty... You've probably seen your poverty. Poverty, war, natural disasters, then back to the minibar. Still, it's horrible. Yes, minibars are kinda exotic besides war. Do you exhibit things? No. Not really. Just paint for myself. What about you? Do you have another work, apart from the paper? Yeah, I got thousands of photos. I don't know what they for. These... These are great. Cheaper than therapy. I suppose I have to do some shock painting... as opposed to shocking. Do you think you're getting over the shock? The dad shock or the accident shock? Can you have two at once? Maybe I'm into bargain on one of them, You know, seven stages of grief. What's the point of knowing where you're at, if you're still going to go though it anyway? I've been seeing death everywhere this weekend. Really? Yeah. I just look at people and I see then dying. So do I, So do I, I imagine it happening all the time. Do you see it happening when you look at me? Do you see death? No. That's good! I don't even know your name! Meryl. Meryl Lee. As in "gently down the stream". Right. I'm Nick. Nick. I don't have a song. Hi. Do you see death when you look at me? No. No I don't. Death. What are we talking about death for? It's not like in the good old days, when you just ignored the whole concept of it. We even flirted with it, at least I did. Oh, me too, embraced it whole-heartedly, smoking, drinking... Taking unidentifiable substitute. - Rugby. - Having unprotected sex. Skiing. Out. Brief. Candle. Life is but a walking shadow. a poor player that struts and frets his hour... upon the stage and then is heard of no more. It is a tail told by an idiot. Full of sound and fury. Christ! Signifying nothing. Can I get a drink, mate? The show's not over. Please. Thank you. Look, it's just a girl, some groceries and a dog. That's so over emoted and twee, I mean... A pretty girl in a pink dress and her dog. Do we only accept things in attractive packages? Well, I wouldn't call it that attractive, alright? - That's a bit harsh. - What? I just think she looks really pretty, and I just think it's sad. What do you think, Anna? The photo on today's papers. The woman whose boyfriend was hit by a train? Did she push him? No! Love the photos of dead-n-missing. They're always so unflattering. They'd use anything for the scoop. Hello. Hi. Yes, just give me a second, Anna, it's for you. Hello. I hate my job. I don't want to do it for the next twenty years. Well, I just bought tickets to London last week. Emma and I are going to work out there for a while. What does that mean? Where does that leave us? You decide. Yeah, sure. Well, I'm pretty busy at the moment. I'll talk to you tomorrow. See you. Why do people have sex! ? [Police hold great fears for eight people missing... after the Anno Hill train crash. ] Two days after the rail disaster, the emergency services spokesman says, they're unlikely to find any survivors. The front carriage so badly crashed, that rescue workers are facing an almost impossible task. ...using 15 years old girls as bait for lonely middle-aged men. ...career in trouble you had a little surprise, which perhaps you didn't want at the time, but which eventually became something which undoubtedly enriched your work. Mate? What're you doing? Jesus! There's people... wow... Cool! Paper's gone up. Another 5 cents. When? From today. I didn't bring anymore money, I pay you tomorrow? It's 5 cents! You seriously want me to put something back. You know what? This is it! All this small minded shit in the world. This narrow minded stuff that just gets stronger... on the paper without any relevant importance of anything Shut up! What is this? Sunday girls' school. Why? I thought you had a shift today. I'm sick. I'm cutting down on the pain killers. Your mother thinks I'm stupid. I played hiding in wholes last night. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. I'm good. thank you. How are you? Good. I... I know I said I'd call, but I realized I didn't get your number. - 8-3-7-3-9-double 2 - Got a pen? I'm sorry I left without saying goodbye, but I didn't want to wake you up. Couldn't sleep. I thought maybe I was snoring. Is that your dad? I'm sure he was going to say something nice when he died. I wasn't nice the last time we spoke. He was just asking how it was going. What about your parents? They live in town? Well, my dad died. God, I'm sorry. - I've been blabbing on. - No, that's alright, it's a while ago. It's more than a year! I came home when he got sick. And he died. I hang around, 'cause I was a bit worried about mom. I even bought a place. As an investment in the future. You know, I thought I'd live in it for a while, before I... had to go back overseas. But I can't... get in there, because I... I have to go to my mom's for lunch. She's cooking. So, sorry, I should go. I don't suppose you'd want to come with me, would you? Dad! Well, you have got broken arm, haven't you? I've given Maggie her medications, so she won't need any until after I pick her up. But if she gets upset or anything, I'm on the mobile. And Oliver's got his inhaler in his pocket. They got 3 dollars pocket money, but don't let them buy junk. And please don't let Maggie eat any ice-cream. She had the worst headache the last time. You forgot to give the earthquake survival plan. Don't worry; I'll make sure they don't get hurt. At the light... Cross at the lights! Cross at the lights. I'm hungry. We're going to stay here, until we get a glimmer of knowledge, ok? Look at that baby? Isn't it cute? Do you know who Jesus is? Jesus Christ Almighty! I'll tell mom you swore. Grouse. Oliver, get off the floor. Maggie, just wait there. I have a cancer, mom. No, Mom, I've got cancer! There you are! Lunch is ready. I wandered about giving those to Becky's little boys. I don't know. There's so much stuff. I can't keep it for ever. She seems very nice. It's a lovely hash I saw the recipe in a paper Looked a bit better at the picture It's nice. Just like a bought one. I love looking at the pictures, but I never make them It's not much fun for one. It's good you came over, I really enjoyed cooking Never thought I would... after all those years of cooking for the family. Special food, when Jim was ill. It wasn't much fun for him! Why should it be nice? Why should it be? I mean... He was fighting a war! War? There's always this stuff in the papers About a brave battle with cancer. But then you're also supposed to accept it... and have this nice everyone-gat her-around-hug-each-other-death When is that turning supposed to happen? I don't know. When it's inevitable. When it would have made better for him to find peace. Your dad was so proud of himself. He wasn't proud of himself, mom! He was dying! And we should have helped him What? I didn't do anything. Course you did! No I didn't. I just let him lie there, waiting. He was terrified It doesn't matter how he died. Your father's death was not the sum of his life, It doesn't matter how the life ends, it matters how it was. I couldn't give him my way of coping, you couldn't give him yours. Everybody has to find a way to face their own death... and life. You shouldn't try to get up on your own! I wanted to go the toiled. Why do you have to be so bloody independent?! What do you want to do now? Want to go to the cricket? Dad, I have a broken arm. Yeah, you have another arm, why don't you just use that? Cricket's a boys game, dad. It's not a boys' game, women are great cricketers. Only in the women's cricket. You said we can play cricket! ! Later, come on. Just come and sit here. Did you ever like me? Relationships just don't work when they start out like this. Stop! It's mom! I've got a headache. Really? Jess's Party! You wasn't supposed to tell. Is that Fill Jasmine? Why couldn't I take them to the party? I don't know. I didn't do the invitations. Come on. Sit belts on. What do you think they were gonna eat at party? Cabbage? Bye. I don't want all this crap again. Well, you have the baby. Don't be stupid. What's stupid? I'll have the baby and you could take it a name. You'll be in charge. I'll pay maintenance. And we don't have to abort. You could work from home. You said you wanted to do that. Got it all sorted out, haven't you? I didn't do this deliberately, you were there too. I read your article today. See the look on that girl's face? And you write that maybe the boyfriend killed himself What would you know? Not everyone's got an agenda. - They don't? - No. Things just happen. I have to go. Just pretend you didn't even know. I'm sorry, I don't know what I've been doing this weekend. Sorry, I... Sorry? You're giving me the fling, aren't you? Well, no. It's just that I can't... start anything. I met you on Friday. We slept together on Saturday. You took me to meet your mother on Sunday, and you can't start anything. That's the tightest relationship I've ever had! Bugger this! And if you think I'm upset because you don't want to see me, well, how dare you! ? Maybe I was going to say "Thanks, but no bloody thanks!" I don't need to spend my whole weekend, my whole life being polite to people like you As the only thing stopping me it's a god-damn... bloody politeness hostage body gene And then personally I'd found a way to isolate that gene... and breed it out so I could tell people like you... to piss-off! Maybe I don't like you, or what you do. I don't need your stupid photos to keep reminding me... all shit in the world. I know it's awful. Scares me stupid. Scares everybody too stupid to do anything. My dad died two weeks ago. Why isn't my picture on the front of a paper? Why isn't everybody who could lose somebody on the front bloody page? So what if I wanted you to like me? Why is that such a crime? What if it is shallow and stupid... to be lonely and want somebody to like you? I just... I'm not in a position... To start anything right now. Because I've just found out I got cancer. What? What kind of a line is that?! Cancer cancer? You're dumping me because you've got cancer. Shouldn't I be dumping you, if you got cancer? Did you forget to take garbage out again mate? I'm fine. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? What's the matter with you? Well, I just got a fight with a girl. The girl you interviewed about this guy. Meryl... I slept with her last night. I just told her I have a cancer. See got cross. Why would you say you have a cancer? I got cancer. What have you got cancer for?! Well, I don't know. Cancer cancer? What else sort of cancer there is? What do you mean cancer-cancer? I got cancer in my lungs, cancer in my balls, cancer in my legs, my arms, my brain. Since when? I don't know. I found it on Friday. Bloody hell, Nick. You're going to be alright? I don't know. I'll find out more tomorrow. Until tomorrow I don't know. Sorry. I'm the train driver. I'm sorry. It wasn't your fault. It's meant to be! Thanks Dad! the survival of a 5 years old girl pulled from the wreckage of the train the child laid trapped in the rubble... beside her dead grandmother for nearly 3 days Kathleen, who was treated for shock and dehydration at the scene was reunited with her relieved and exhausted parents... shortly after being pulled from the wreckage - Sorry. - Sorry.
