Every time we go to the supermarket you get grumpy. Hello. Excuse me. Cash? I am not grumpy. Debit. Did you test it? Yes. -Did you try the light bulb? -No. How can you be so lazy, Coco? What's wrong now? Still grumpy for the money. Not only that but you buy only one, Coco. Unbelievable. And this? Did we need this? Yes, we need them. We have some at home. Coco, things deteriorate and need replacement, now and then. Like that T-shirt you're wearing. When I get home I will trash it. Pipi, you are really beautiful. Shut up. No, Coco, no fucking way. I'm serious. We sell the house, the car, everything. We get a great fucking house in the Cordoba Sierras. -What's so fucking funny? -The Sierras, you? Suddenly a hippie? You? You can't live without your computer. What do you mean? That's not being a hippie. Coco, please, you are a pussy. You can't spend a day without clean socks. You would come back home running! ln the Cordoba Sierras, I would go barefoot. Don't get mad, Coco. Don't get sensitive on me. You are a city creature, that's all. You are not designed for nature. Green. What you do mean, no? Coco, don't be stubborn. Okay, keep trying, keep trying. What's up, Horacio? -Stocking up? -Yes, yes, stocking up. That's impressive. It seems... You are ready for war! I'm sorry, it was my cigar. No, it's my nervous cough. It became chronic. But it's fine. -Well, goodbye, Horacio. -Bye. And good luck! You, too. Hello. Mom... Fine, here we are. No, it didn't ring. Don't know why. It was off. The battery probably died. What is it? No. Let's see. Seven is now the number of countries affected by the virus. Besides Mexico, the U.S., Canada, Spain and the U.K., -We have new cases in two other... -Okay, I'll call you later. The alert level was raised by the WHO to 4, on the 6-level scale for epidemics. Pipi, come here for a second. Those were the words of the World Health Organization, Before the quick virus expansion. Before the rumor of closed trades and the stop of activities, the chaos starts... So what did your parents say? Are they having a good time? Fine, I guess... I didn't ask. Coco, are you autistic? Why didn't you ask? They were worried about this. We agreed to talk later. Hello? Who is it? A recording. They want one person per family to go to the lobby. Okay. -Wait, wait. -Give it to me. -Do you want a tangerine? -I am going there. Take it with you. -What is happening? -The took Caraza's wife. She was ill. They took Caraza as well. To do tests. Their daughters are away. They said someone would come to inform us, but so far, nothing. Good evening. Good evening, Zanutto. What's up? Fine, fine. Awesome. Is the council meeting now? Didn't you get the call? They took Caraza and his wife and the building was closed down. No one enters or leaves, Zanutto. Someone is coming. -Can you hear me? -What's going on? As you already know, the building is under quarantine. There is no reason to panic. It's only a preventive measure. Please stay in your apartments. Keep contact with neighbors to a minimum. Our doctors will visit to ensure you don't have the symptoms. Now, how many people are living in the building? It's a new building. It's us and our families. Give me a minute. Lange, you are three. -Three and one maid. -Don't say anything. We don't have to tell them a thing. Don't be ridiculous, Tomaso. They are here to help. -Zanutto, you and your wife, right? -Exactly. And Bruno! We are three. You, Slimel, two... Two. My wife is seven months pregnant. Tomaso, three. Plus the Chinese in 10A. Anybody knows if those Chinese are in? Well, let's say they are, they are three. So the total is 16. I think you counted three at Lange's but they're four. You are right, I skipped Lange's maid. We are 16 people and one maid. Three neighbors from the 10th floor could be away. If they are away, we are 13 and a maid. Now, gentlemen, back to your homes. In case of an emergency, call 833. Any questions? My wife is pregnant. In an emergency, call 833, sir! Good night. Still coughing. -Yes, it's nervous. -Yeah, so you said. Take good care of it. This is not working, I don't know what you did, Coco. Must be the server. -And what are you doing now? -I'm doing an inventory. I want to know what we have and what we don't, then I gonna make a rationing plan. You're exaggerating, Coco. You are irresponsible. We are under quarantine and I think you don't know what that means. -Well, take note, one less tangerine. -Funny... No! But if you want to go mad, go mad alone. -So, you can't talk? -No, there's a recording Saying the lines are broken. -When you finish, the tea, please. -Okay. Motherfucker! MAXlMUM ALERT: PHASE 6 - PANDEMlC For this reasons, I have decided to raise the alert from Phase 5 to Phase 6. See, again, it says, "Try again later." No way, piece of junk. -The bulb in the kitchen lamp burst. -Well, we bought one. -No. It doesn't work. -Coco, I am going to kill you. -Who is it? -Health Ministry. Epidemic control. I'm Dr. Craviotto. Excuse me. The whole block is under quarantine. -How long will it last? -I couldn't tell you right now. It's looking complicated. They are dropping like flies! -How far along are you? -Seven months. -Nausea? -No. -Headache? -No. -Mucus? -No, I'm fine. I will leave this brochures. With info about the virus. Any symptoms, please call 833. -Write it down... -It's right here. So, I'll be on my way. Good luck! What are you doing here? I told you to stay home. Okay, do whatever... Hello. -Hi, how are you, Zanutto? -Fine, fine. Awesome. I was wondering if you could lend me an adaptor. Two to three... Two to three, I'll check. It'll be a second. -Who is it? -It's me, dear. Looking for an adaptor. It's for this shaver. Never use it but I ran out of blades. Two to three. No... We have blades in the drawer. You never use them. -No... -I saw them. Those, no. They had rust, I threw them away. That's okay, it doesn't matter. Thank you. -No, no. Wait, Zanutto, wait a second. -But I've just told you... Coco, that was thorough. Here, Zanutto, adaptor and blades. -Very good, thank you so much. -Where were them? Thank you very much. Very nice of you. And thank you, kid. See you later, Zanutto. It's important to wash your hands at all times using soap and water. Do not share any food or dishware. Keep your homes aired. Ventilate offices and closed spaces. Stay away from people showing symptoms. Do not kiss or shake hands, just wave. -Generala! -You son of a bitch. -What was that noise? -What do I know? She's kicking. Coco, she is kicking. -Why didn't you tell me? -I just did. No, now it stopped. Double Generala! Motherfucker. I can't play like this. Come on. Coco! No! Stay... Airports remain closed. Hospitals are overwhelmed, and streets are deserted, owned by vandals and marauders that do not respect the curfew. Even the most basic articles are unavailable. Nausea, headache, high fevers and finally confusion and disorientation are the first symptoms of the disease. The gen is fragmented and each of the segments of the gen, eight in all, has the individual capacity to replicate. In easier terms, each one can reproduce. A virus that travels... -What are you doing? -So. Do you like it? Can you please take off that disgusting and ridiculous moustache? You don't like it, then. Listen, there's someone screaming outside. I heard loud voices. -I'm checking it out. -No! What are you doing? Nosy... Who are you? The nosy old woman in the building? -This one is old. -Hey, watch it! I'm a mother. Wait, don't be a dick, wear a mask out. We have a double dickhead here. -I can't stand him any longer. -Calm down, I know. Because this guy opens the door. Zanutto, don't be afraid. We are here to help you. That's right, Zanutto, we are here to help. Don't be afraid. Leave. Listen to me. Go home. -Calm down, if you don't... -I'm tired, I can't take it... -Let me talk... -Okay, go ahead. Zanutto... Don't be hard-headed, Lange is exaggerating. He is nervous and got carried away, but he means well. We want to help. Open up, come on. That way we can calmly talk. Go to hell. I don't need a thing and I want no trouble. Zanutto, be reasonable. We just want to talk, nothing else. We have to talk. Among neighbors and friends. Do you understand? Do you always wave hammers when talking to friends? Go home, leave me alone. Fine, we are leaving. But remember that we tried to be reasonable. Horacio, what are you doing dressed like that? What are you doing dressed like that? Do you think this is a joke? Come with me. Is your cough cured? Yes. It comes and goes. It's a nervous condition. Use this to seal doors and windows. Now listen carefully. Beware of Lange and Guglierini. If they approach with small talk, football, the weather, anything, you come and tell me. Okay? The cough? Fine, you already asked. It's nervous. It's okay. Do you need anything else? No, thanks. Well, actually, I could really use a light bulb. -What kind? -100 watts would be great. How many do you need? Three. But with one I'll be okay. Wait here. Light bulbs. Also take this video. Watch it carefully, it's important. What was the matter? Nothing... -What took you so long? -Nothing. Horacio gave us bulbs. Great, the one in the bedroom just burst. What's all this? Give me a minute... What's this? Light bulbs. -What's wrong? What's in there? -Nothing, light bulbs... Nothing, nothing, light bulbs and more light bulbs. Well, fine. I'll change the one in our room and you do the living room. What's the New World Order and what is the controlled reduction of population also known as Phase 7. Phase 7 is a plan to contain overpopulation if the world's economies falter, consisting in -a controlled reduction of it... -So, what is it? I don't know, ravings of your demented friend. You played it. I'm not watching. Are you ready? Coco, please stop fooling around and go change the bulbs. Lights off, Pipi, come on. To be able to implement a new world order that guarantees the status quo of the corporations, the only ones responsible for the... -Ready? -Yes, Coco, please. No! What is that, Coco? -Hello, hello. -It gives me the creeps. Is anyone in there? -Come here, astronaut. -Do you like it? Who is it? It's me, Horacio, we need to talk. The thing is... I was heading to bed. It will be fast. Meet me in five minutes at the sauna. Wear the suit. What are you doing without the mask? Put it on. This is not a game! -Did you check your temperature? -Yes, yes, I'm fine. The hood... One thing, the revolver... It's not a revolver, it's a pistol. Keep it, you never know. -Your cough? The hood! -I don't need this revolver. I don't need it so I thank you deeply, but... Thank me later. Now listen... ln five minutes, Lange and Guglierini are coming to see me. Me, not you. I made you come early so we could talk. Every night, I come to the terrace for a smoke. It is a very interesting place. From here I can see every movement in the neighborhood. Last night I saw Lange and Guglierini. I listened quietly and heard them discussing Zanutto. It was not all clear but I did hear that they had a proposal for me. When Lange asked about you... No, he seems nice, but too weird to be trusted with men's business. Besides, I don't really trust him. He is a little weird. Well, it's better this way 'cause I don't want to see them either. They don't want to see me, I don't want to see them. I don't need to be here! Everyone's happy, we let it rest. Don't worry, don't say a word. I'll do the talking. The important thing is that you and me stay together. Today it's Zanutto, but tomorrow it could be us. Horacio, I don't like forming gangs, even less gangs with guns... -And even less with my wife... -Here's Guglierini. Remember, zip your lip. How are you? I'm glad you made it. Lange? There he is. Why is he here? Ezequiel is a man and he can be part of this discussion. What are you doing in those ridiculous outfits? Isn't it too much? Everyone minds their own fucking business. So, what is so important? Let's start. Excuse me, aren't we waiting for Zanutto? Zanutto is not coming. Zanutto happens to be the problem. We suspect that he is ill, he coughs like a dog every night, poor old man. He is ill, coughing all day. He has, what, a few days left, at most. The man is old and alone. No! His wife is there with him. Zanutto's wife is in a mental hospital but he hides it. I know because I bribe the Sunday doorman and he gives me data on the neighbors. But that is not the issue here. The problem is the risk of disease. Zanutto is above us and under you. He has the building cut in halves. Our plan is to move him to 10D, since the Chinese in 10A are away. There he should be comfortable enough. We would all take care of him until he breathes his last breath. He would be quarantined. Pardon me but we are all already quarantined. We have to think of our families and he will have everything he needs. I give my word. I am a public notary. ln my opinion, we should call 833 and wait for a doctor's diagnosis... So you want to call 833? How long has it been since you called 833? How many times did you call? Did you call 883 200 times? Here, call, call again. If you get through, I will turn gay, deal? If we don't take care of each other, no one will. Let me add this, I am running out of food. I don't have a thing, and with my eyes I saw the old man unload a full car. Tell them, Eze. The true colors, very nice. -Listen, Lange, and you, Guglieri. -Guglierini. Who gives a flying fuck? I don't like any of you. I don't like you, I don't like you... And I don't like the dick face that your dick-headed son carries around. Anything you plan, you do it alone. Don't count on us. Something else. The fourth floor is from now on a restricted area. You place one foot on it and it will be considered an act of war. Is that clear? I think you are exaggerating. We are thinking of the common well-being. -Common well-being, my small dick. -Why are you so rude? We don't need... -On our way. -No need for disrespect. Listen, one thing, listen... My wife's waiting, so excuse me. And I will keep trying to call 833. One day you'll be grateful. You clowns! Act of war! Is that clear? Where are you going? Home. Come here, get in. But dinner is ready. And I don't want to bother you. Come in. Just for a second. Warning WHO pandemic The choice is a new world order or chaos Hello. Did you cover your windows? I think it is too much. Do you think the virus flies? It's not for the virus, it's to hide what goes on inside. Is this the Cordoba Sierras? Did you watch the video? Yes. The beginning. It was good so far. Technically well accomplished. Technically, it is a piece of shit. Save the ass kissing, I'm not a moron. Besides, I didn't do it and what it says is what matters. Let's go. Horacio, you will hurt yourself, or hurt somebody else. This is not lethal. It's low intensity. At the most it stuns you a bit. They always said I was paranoid. At school, my family, in therapy. Paranoid this, paranoid that, paranoid the other. Even "acute paranoid." An invention. It doesn't exist. I couldn't find it in any book! Do you think this is a flu? Controlled decrease of the population. It comes from the top. But I know what to do. I am ready. Especially ready for dicks like Lange and Guglieri, or Guglierini or whatever the fuck it is. Horacio, please, turn this off. You will hurt somebody. And it makes no sense. There is an elevator, do you remember? Do you think I'm crazy? No. I think we are all a little nervous and carrying guns and placing charges is a bit too much. Please turn it off. You stay close to me and you will be fine. And watch the video. Please remain home when experiencing coughs, headaches... Where were you? With Horacio. -He had something to tell me. -Coco, please. Stay out of trouble. His power was out. I went to the basement with him. Fixed. Meanwhile I changed all the bulbs. It would be good if instead of dealing with the neighbor's problems, you'd take care of your house. -Right? -Yes, it would be good. It would be, wouldn't it? Wash your hands at all times using soap and water. Do not share any food or dishware. Keep your homes aired. Stay away from people showing symptoms. Do not kiss or shake hands, just wave. -Who is this? -It's me, Horacio. Martin. What's going on? What time is it? It's 4:00 a.m., sorry for that. But I think we should warn Zanutto. We'll do it tomorrow. I'm afraid tomorrow might be too late. I think we should go now. Horacio... I was saying, tonight is safer. I can't. I took a pill and I am K.O. Tomorrow will be fine, don't worry. At what time is the game? What game? What game? Forget about it, I'll go myself. -Out of the way, Guglierini. -Wait, Lange, wait. -I can hear music. -So? Do you want me to dance? -Not the time to be lame, okay? -Okay, okay, but get out of the way. Get off my balls, move out of the way! Are you ready, Eze? -Yes. -Yes? Sure? Do it, do it. Mom! Mom! Mom, open up, Mom! -Open up! -What's the matter? How you doing, madam? It's a pleasure to meet you. What happened to you? I can't hear you. Coco, there's blood. All over. -No, I can't hear you. -What are you up to, Coco? Nothing, nothing. I didn't mean to. It was an accident. I fell, there, I was with Horacio. It's 5:00 in the morning. Do you think I'm a dickhead? What was it that couldn't wait? -Can you speak on this side... -What were you doing at 5:00 a.m., Coco? Don't worry, Pipi. It was a mistake. The doctor said you needed rest. You worry me. Look at you. Do you expect me to believe you were fixing, what, a faucet drip? Overgrown dickhead! What? -Say what? -What? What? -Say what? What? Asshole! -What? Fuck you! Pipi, you are insane! Pipi... Pipi, open up... Pipi... Who is it? It's Zanutto, dear, I'm sorry it's so early. Zanutto, what's up? Fine, fine. Awesome. Tell him I'm out. I left. An excuse! Is it important? What do you need? -Tell him we are sleeping... Sleeping. -We were in bed, Zanutto. I needed to see your husband. Power is out in my place. I have to go to the basement. If he could lend me a hand... I wouldn't know where to start. I'm in bed, I'll come by tomorrow. I'm in bed, tell him I'm in bed! ln bed! Will go tomorrow! He's sleeping. May I give him a message? What a pity. I will have to go by candlelight, then. It's fine, some other time. Is he feeling all right? I had an accident. No! Accident, no. Tell him I went to bed. Don't leave... I can't hear you, dear. Is your husband well? Are you okay? Yes. If you want the adaptor back, let me know, okay? Kid? -What's going on? -Horacio, it's me, Martin. What are you doing without a suit, you moron? Will you ever learn? Get the mask at least and then come back. I told you. I told you to watch that cough. I knew it! Stay here. -Let's go. -Where? Exploring. I'll stay. I don't want to meet this madman who believes he is Daktari. I had enough. Where is the pistol I gave you? Hidden in that box. -Do you know how it works? -No idea. This is the clip. Now it's loaded. To shoot, remove the safety lock. Always shoot twice. If you miss, you make a correction. If you don't, two is better than one. I'm sorry, Horacio, I will not kill anybody. Then shoot at their knees. Horacio, please, wait. Look, this is the deal. Zanutto has nothing to lose. He won't mind a few more. To him, we are just like those two fools. So you can discuss it over coffee or at the next council meeting. But my advice is you shoot him in the head and that's that. I am not going, Horacio. Then why the fuck did you knock on my door? Either you come with me or we part ways for good. Is that clear? Horacio, what did you do for a living? Sold health insurance. -Nothing. Are you sure of what you saw? -Yes. Turn it off, it's not a toy. Fill the bags with what you can find. Food, medicine, anything. This would be stealing from the dead. I can't imagine anything lower. The dead don't really care and we are not stealing, we are stocking up. Hurry up! Hello. Who are you? What are you doing here? I am Slimel from 4A and he is Horacio from 4B. You should be lying down, madam. I am looking for my husband. He left yesterday with Carlos and hasn't come back yet. What time is it? I don't have a watch. Around 9:00, I guess. I will stay here waiting for him. He'll be back soon. They must have gone to play racquetball. Meanwhile, why don't you get me the recipe you promised? Did you see the videotape? Mom? Help! Help me! It's me, Slimel, from 4A. Horacio, Zanutto is here! The gun? No, I don't understand. I am asking you to wait here, you dickhead. I think there is a council meeting. -Coco... -Pipi, stay inside. What was that noise? What is that thing? What the hell are you doing? -Go inside, please. -Martin! Go inside, I'll tell you later. Matilda, your father is a dickhead. He is out there. Fucking shit. What happened? My socks are wet. Five years ago, from this distance, I could have shaved your moustache. Fuck, I can't see shit. Turn that off, you schmuck. Listen to me. We just want to talk. We have nothing to do. The problem was with Lange and Guglierini. Let's solve this in a civilized way. Like good neighbors. This is inconvenient for all! Zanutto, lay down your position! Zanutto! Speak! How are you, Zanutto? Fine, fine. Awesome. This makes no sense. Let's make a truce and solve it diplomatically. I'm sure we can put this regrettable incident behind us. Nothing to regret. I am not sick. This is just a seasonal cold. They messed with me and well, they took something with them. I believe you and I agree. That's why I want to talk. Come out. Very well. Lower your weapons, then. On the floor, where I can see them. Now it's your turn. Now it's your turn! Now the kid. Now, it's your turn. Einstein said World War III would be fought with sticks and knives. -The fourth. -What? The fourth world war. But not with sticks and knives... With sticks and stones. The safety lock, kid. Can I ask you for a favor, kid? Would you take care of my dog? Thank you. I don't remember the last time I went out. How long is a fucking quarantine? It's dead. -Are you okay? -Yes, fine, just a little dizzy. I'll be fine, I needed some air. But I am feeling better already. Horacio, did you leave the building's door open? Will you be okay? Yes, I'll be fine. We have to go to Guglierini's and then Zanutto's. We'll go later. Hello, Pipi. Hello, Pipi. Hello. Hello. I brought a few things. That's good. Come on. Pipi. Can you leave me alone? I am in the bathroom. What's wrong with you, Pipi? What's wrong with you! Leave me alone. I'm in the bathroom, get it? What did you bring? Where did you get all this? From Lange's. Why did he give you this? ln exchange of what? What did you do? Lange is dead. Sit down, Pipi. Your friend. Who is it? Are you okay? Open that door. How long have you been getting ready for this? This is nothing. See all this? Take it all. Leave this place. Here are my car keys. Leave the city. Go here, it's far. Look. It's the Cordoba Sierras. There you will find everything you will ever need. If this seems like a lot, wait and see. Go there. I have a favor to ask. Take Luli. She is healthy. Don't worry. And her mother? Her mother left months ago. She said I was crazy. So, she left. I kept Luli. One last favor. It's ready. What are you saying? Are you crazy? Put this away, please. You are tired, you need to rest, that's it. I am as good as dead. I am asking for a Christian gesture. I don't want to go like Guglieri's wife, talking bullshit. You ask for a Christian gesture but I am not a Christian. So excuse me. I can do anything for you, but not this. Put it away. What are you doing? That's enough. I think you are a little off. My pregnant wife is waiting for me. Something else, I have a family, I cannot take care of your daughter. We should look for her mother, she will take better care of her. So, everything is fine. Thanks. Talk to you soon! So are you really a dickhead? Do you think it's going to be a free ride? Shoot! Shoot, you pussy! Aim well, you moron. Aim! Shit! Come back here, you son of a bitch. You fucking pussy. Come here. Come back here! Stop, Horacio! Stop, Horacio, you are delirious. It's your fever! Now do you think that I am the dickhead? Do you think that I can't tell that you want to keep it all?
