Nothing they liked to sing and dance and embrace. Dance and hug and sing and dance and sing and hug ... and embrace and dance and sing and hug and sing and ... But one day the Trolls discovered ... Un berteno! The bertenos not know sing ... or dance ... or embrace. They were the most embittered creatures all over the place. And when they saw how happy they were trolls ... They wanted to have some of that happiness. Ow mom! Eating trolls made them so happy they began a tradition. Once a year, every year ... the berbenos gathered around the tree to test Troll happiness ... in a holiday they called ... the Trolsticio. Good morning, Daddy! Daddy, wake up! Daddy, wake up! Awake!

They are as bitter as you. Which means that not eat any troll! Quick! Let's save our friends! - Your friends. - Our friends. Do not deny it. Ay, Abanabus. You're my only friend in this whole miserable world. Dad was right. Never, never, never ever I'll be happy. Never. Never say Never. Chad. Todd. Chef! Where did you come from? My father drove you 20 years ago. You have been behind the plant all the time? Hopefully. High King. No. I was hiding in the woods ... I am thinking about how I cheated. If only I had way to make him feel better. That's difficult. The only thing that could make me happy is to eat a troll. And that will not happen, thanks to you. But maybe yes. Thanks to me. You find trolls. That means that maybe I can be happy! So is. Of course everyone else in Berteno People will still embittered ... but that does not care. I am your king, so maybe interested me. What do you propose, exactly? Do what again the Trolsticio? For everyone? Yes! That's exactly what I propose. Great idea, Your Highness. Completely brilliant. He is very clever! I suppose. And I, your loyal chef, I'll be right behind. - With a knife. - What? With a knife, a spoon, a ladle. After all, I'm the chef! Of course you are! I'm back! You, dishwasher. What is your name? Bridget. Congratulations, Idget. You work for me. It takes those dishes down and begins to wash. Yes, Chef. Thank you, Chef. Do not cry, Mr. Bear. Friends, Mr. Teddy is very scared! Hear! Please, we must remain calm. So, fine. A troll is a delicious calm troll. And they are the key ingredient in my recipe for success. You see, he who controls the trolls controls the kingdom. And I am "that"! You are a man? For this time tomorrow I'll be the queen ... and all the Berteno People have just what you deserve. True Happiness! - Chad. - Todd. Where do you think they are our friends? If I had to guess, I'd say in the stomach of some berteno. Try to be positive. Just once. Maybe you like it. All right. I'm sure they are alive ... and we will be handed over on a silver platter. Thank you. It was not so hard, right? - Ramon! - Time to embrace? Really? Listen out! It will be the best Trolsticio history! What an excellent idea I had! Yes. Tomorrow is the Trolsticio, friends. - And must be perfect! - Yes, Chef! How good it feels to give orders to all again! - Ramon, look! - They are alive? And on a silver platter. You both were right! To celebrate the occasion, Highness, look. I found his old bib troll. I bet I still have. As glove! Is it funny? Let's see who laughs when you bite the head. When you bite your head at all! Just a moment. Chef, not enough to feed all heads Berteno Pueblo. How will Trolsticio without sufficient trolls? There are many more where these came out, Highness. Safe? I promised everyone a troll. No, no, Your Highness. Everything will be fine. If you were worried ... Would you be willing to do this? Arroyn! My first troll! Go ahead, eat, Grisel king. Enjoy the taste of true happiness. Should not we wait to Trolsticio? Highness, every day is Trolsticio when you have trolls. I suppose. Dad said the first should be special. Now you are my king. Yes, I am the king. But should share this moment with all the kingdom. Do it! - Ow mom! - Do not! Yes! Idget! Enclose these trolls in your room and resgurdalos with your life! Yes, Chef. Yes, yes, I know. - Ramon, we must save him! - From your stomach? Do not chew or swallow we saw! Face it, Poppy, sometimes a person enters the mouth of another and never comes out. If we go after Arroyn, we eat both. Sorry, it's too late for him. Poppy! Dishwasher! Lava these pots and pans for Trolsticio! The king invited them all. Save yourself! In complete solitude I carry you in me Dreaming kiss you so And be on you Watch when you spend with fervor It's me which awaits you? the truth is in your eyes Your smile is the truth There is no one who most wanted And I want to hug You always know what to say All are inept! Perfect your attitude I have to dress myself ... You are why I love Always you. He's in love with the king! What are you talking about? The bertenos not have feelings. Maybe you do not know everything about the bertenos! Come on! - Boys! - Poppy! Celebrating always together celebrating Today there partying and going on here Do not! Here there is no party! The sooner out of here ... Before we save Arroyn! What? It's me who are looking for love?

I do not think he's alive. I hope he is alive, and that is enough. Why do you always see the bright side? Here there is no good side! Zero! There is always a good side! Hear! Where do believe that they? Brilliantine! Do not! Get back to the box! The Chef will be furious! No! Bridget, detente! You are in love with the king Grisel. I do not know what are you talking about. Sorry! That's not mine. Anyway it does not matter. He does not even know I'm alive. Bridget, I can help! There is a way to have what we want both. Do you also love Grisel? You'd better swerve, friend! No. Bridget, no. The troll king Grisel got to the mouth is Arroyn. And he would do anything to save him. The only problem is ... we can not approach the king without eat us. But you if you can. You can approach him and tell him how you feel. Of course not. I can not get anything like the king. His Genialeza Real never speak with a dishwasher like me. And if you do not know you're a dishwasher? And if you think you are a complete dreamboat?

Come on, Ramon! Sing with us! Yes Ramn! Sing with us! No, I'm fine like this. Do not you think this will work? No no no. Is not that. It's because I do not sing. - Ramon! - No reason.

Once my uncle broke his neck tap dancing. How to sing killed your grandmother? What song to sing? The singing was me.

Yes I have a nice smile, right? If you have. I can not believe I'm saying this ... Guys acting on your own! But to be with you today ... It makes me realize that true happiness is possible. It is! True happiness is much closer than you imagine. It's right here. I guess it's cute. What do you think now? - Arroyn? - I knew I was alive! Mr. Teddy is alive! What a surprise! Did you say something! - I've been keeping this little guy ... - Help! Piety! Tell me, my Lady, I'll see you at the banquet of Trolsticio? Well of course. I'll be washing. "A"! Praising.

There must be an explanation. At least give it a chance. Thank you, Poppy. I will not betray. No wait! Stop! You'd better give us an explanation! When I was about to accept my fate ...

There must be another way. I will do anything. Do not! Arroyn, please do not. Trust me. I wish there was another way not to eat me. But there is not.
