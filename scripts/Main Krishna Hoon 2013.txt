Can't you hear me? l've been shouting your name from long. Why are you shouting so much? - No.. - One by one. Here he is.. where had you been? Always stay with Tempo. ls that clear? Vitamin, Sanskar.. - When will l get parents? Parents? Why do you need parents suddenly? l'm here.. l'm your mother as well as father. Do l lack in giving you love that you are thinking like this? No.. but still l want parents. Won't l get parents? - You'll get. You'll surely get them. Why won't you get them? Not only you, all the children will get. Nice parents. Promise. - Sister guarantees it. Yes. - Sanskar won't get parents because he is dark. He is dark. - No, you shouldn't say that. Lord Krishna was also whitish. Do you know, all the colors have their own importance? - Yes. Once all the colors started fighting. Blue color said l'm very important. So the color of the sky is blue. Then green color said, 'get lost, not you, but l'm important.. ..so all the trees and the leaves are green in color. The same way, red, yellow, orange, everyone said.. ..'l'm better than you, l'm important.' The rain was listening to them. She said, 'you all are important in your own place.' Then there was a strong lightening in the sky. All the colors got scared and hold each other hands. Then a beautiful rainbow was seen in the sky. All the colors were smiling together. Just like that. Everyone hold each others hands. These kids.. Sister, what's the matter? Brother Nattu, the way Krishna spoke about parents.. ..did you hear that? But his disease.. who will adopt him? l get scared when l think about his future. Sister, you are worrying unnecessarily. Krishna is a unique child. god has his mercy on him. You say all these things, don't you? - Yes. So, god would've surely thought something good for him. Sister, l guarantee you. Children, tell me.. who made Agra's world famous Taj Mahal? Who made it? - Tell me, who made it? Sister, a carpenter made it. Who is that carpenter? Krishna, Taj Mahal was made by Shah Jahan. Sister, Shah Jahan got it made. But the carpenter made it. - Oh. He said it right, isn't it? - lntelligent. Very intelligent. Okay.. l'll ask you one more intelligent question. Yes, it is 1 4. - 1 4! This is a very simple thing.. but l'm telling that 1 0 + 4 is equal to 2. What? - How is that possible? lt is possible. See this.. 1 0 o'clock plus 4 hours.. ..is equal to.. - 2 o'clock! - Yes. This is an intelligent thing, isn't it? l remembered one more thing.. do you know.. ..an ostrich's eyes are bigger than his brains? Star fish.. it doesn't have a brain at all. What's the matter? - Sister, the family is here. l had verified them yesterday.. - They are here? - Yes. Do one thing.. - Yes. You make the children ready, l'll chat with them. - Yes. Tell me, why do you want to adopt a child? Actually.. - Actually ma'am, she had a miscarriage thrice. The doctors say that she cannot conceive now. So, we've decided to adopt a child now. Okay.. - Yes, whichever child we adopt from here.. ..we'll take care of him very well. - Yes. You have to do it. Actually, we give our children only to those.. ..who are responsible, caring, and gentle. l don't let my children suffer for anything here. All the children stay happily. We all stay like a happy family. So, when we get a better family than this.. ..only then l allow my children to go. Brother Nattu has seen our office and house. He doesn't have any problem. Tempo, why are you applying so much of oil on your head? So that l look like a fool. Why do you want to look like a fool? Because l don't want to go from here leaving sister. Why should l go? lf l go away.. ..where will l find brother Nattu to scare him? - You are right. Tempo, give me some oil. Even l don't want to go leaving sister. l've even prayed to god that they take Krishna with them. Why do you want to send Krishna away? Shall l tell you? Sister Kanta loves Krishna very much. So, this girl is jealous. - Why should l feel jealous? You may feel jealous. Krishna is my best friend. lf he goes away, even l won't like it. But l wish that these people take Krishna with them. golu, why have you become like a ghost? No one applies so much of powder. give me some, l'll apply it. We follow all the rules of adoption.. ..but there are some rules of this orphanage too. Sister, no problem. We'll follow all the rules. Okay, you can meet the children. We'll complete the rest of the formalities later. Please, come. - Let him also come. These are our cute children. She is our cute child Diya. He is Krishna, Sanskar, Vitamin.. Vitamin is not his real name. His real name is Vineet. We call him Vitamin with love. - Oh. He is golu. He is Tempo.. we found him in a tempo, so.. He is Christmas. - You would've found him on Christmas. Wow.. you are very intelligent. They want to take one of you to their house. You meet them. - Okay. Brother Nattu.. he is going to Krishna.. Sister, l've told them. You are number 1 mischievous. Sister, we would like to adopt Sanskar. - Yes. Wow.. very nice. Come on. We'll talk in the office. - Okay. - Okay. - Let's go. Lucky. Yeah ! - Sanskar.. Sanskar, you got new parents. - Sanskar, you got new parents. lf someone gets help from our orphanage.. ..it is like a big achievement for us. Sister, shall l go? - Yes. Sanskar, you are going to your new house. - Yes. Behave nicely. go. Bye! - Bye! Bye. Bye, Sanskar. - Bye. Why are the children shouting so much? Sister, they all are watching Hrithik Roshan's movie. Brother Nattu, did all the children have food? - Oh my god. All the children had food, but not one. Who didn't eat? - Krishna. Why? l'm trying to explain to him from so long, but he is not ready to eat. Moreover, he is not ready to watch.. ..his favorite hero, Hrithik Roshan's movie. - See this. You are a good spy. Where is he? - There, he's sitting outside. Krishna, what are you doing here sitting alone? You are sitting upset here. Tell me.. what's the matter? Nothing. - You won't tell me? Piping hot food.. - Tell me. Krishna, come on. - Yes. Sister, take this food. Look, l've cooked your favorite food today. l'm not hungry. l won't eat this. You are not hungry? What did you eat? - Nothing. l'm still not hungry. So, l don't want to eat. Your answers and your style.. is like Krishna. But sister, he is Krishna, isn't it? l'm not talking about him, but about Lord Krishna. While eating food, he used to trouble his mother Yashoda. The same way? - Yes. He is nothing, but he was more stubborn. More stubborn. - No, he was so mischievous.. ..that he was ahead of everyone. He and his team used to create a chaos in whole gokul. Everyone used to complaint about him at home. Do you want to know how he used to trouble his mother, Yashoda? Yes, sister. l want to know. - Sister, even l want to know. But l'm not getting any answer from him. Krishna, tell her. Tell her or sister will not tell the story to us. Yes, l want to know. But there's one condition, you have to eat food. Sister, our Krishna will surely eat food. You will food, won't you? - No food, no story. No sister, one minute. Eat a little. Come on. - Very good. Krishna! Krishna! Krishna! What's the matter, Sudama? We searched the whole village, but we couldn't find any butter. But where did the butter go? l feel Lala has hidden all the butter. - Yes. l see.. come with me. You go and have food. - Okay, sir. Wow.. - So, all the butter from gokul is here. You come soon. - Okay, sir. There's lot of butter here. Butter? Hurry up. l'm famished. But how will we go inside? ''l'm Krishna.'' Krishna, how do we come inside? - Come near that door. Hurry up. Wow! - There's so much butter here. Krishna, you are great. Wow, a river of butter. There's butter in this too.. l'll eat the whole thing. Wow, there's butter here also. What have you done? Who is it? Who is inside? Who's there? Open it. l'm telling you, open the door! l'll not spare them today. Krishna? Oh, it is you? What is this? l'm ruined. Krishna, you ruined all the butter. l'll not spare you all. Krishna, open the door. - Lala, we'll not open the door. Oh god, l'm ruined. Aunt, did you see Krishna? - No, l didn't see him. l looked for him in the whole village. l don't know where he is. He is hungry since morning. Poor guy. - Poor guy? Do you think your Krishna will stay hungry? He has eaten all the butter in my house. He didn't eat alone, he made all his friends eat it. Why should l lie to you? You come with me and see it for yourself. - Okay. Come. Look there. - Oh god, he is telling the truth. What do l do with Krishna? Sister, the story is over as well as the food. give me. - Sister, did you have food? lt is good. You at least remembered me after the story. l'll have it now. Oh god.. dear Krishna..

Mr. Dipen, all the children that we have here.. ..they are so sweet and cute that you'll get confused.. ..who will you take and who will you leave. But you don't get confused. l'll give you a child that you'll become very happy. Brother Nattu.. - Yes? Do you have a factory of making poppadum? No, sister Deepali. We don't make poppadum to earn money.. ..but to run this orphanage. Our sister Kanta has dedicated her whole life.. ..to help these helpless woman and orphan children. l'm very happy to hear that there's a woman.. ..like Mother Teresa in gujrat too. Boss, l salute sister Kanta. - l salute her daily. Children, don't do mischief. Hey golu.. Sanskar, Vitamin.. - Very cute children. They are cute, isn't it? - Yes. give me the ball.. - They are very mischievous too. You take this. - Oh pal.. Dear, what's your name? greetings.. - Sister Kanta. greetings, sister Kanta. l've checked your files. Everything looks okay. Okay. - You can meet the children. Sister Kanta, l think, we got our child. Look, you.. - No, you go. Brother Nattu, you told them about Krishna, isn't it? l really like him. - ls it? Sister, l think we shouldn't tell them. We shouldn't tell them? What do you mean? l mean, we shouldn't tell them. He is looking so happy. - He is really sweet. That's okay, but some day they'll know about it, isn't it? Yes, so what. You think, what if their own child was in this condition? So.. what.. - Sister, nothing will happen. l guarantee you. Please.. please. not this time. Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah !

''Happy birthday to you.'' Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Krishna! Sister? What's the matter? Brother Nattu.. - Yes. l don't know why l felt something happened to Krishna. l'm feeling very scared. l hope nothing happened to him. Nothing would've happened to Krishna. Since Krishna left, you've been only thinking about him. That's the reason, you feel so. No, brother Nattu.. it is not like that. Sister, he must be very happy there. They'll keep them happily. l guarantee you. You know, when l guarantee something, it is true. So, stop thinking about Krishna and.. ..take Lord Krishna's name and go to sleep. He will surely do that. goodnight. - goodnight. Brother Nattu, l shall leave now. goodbye. - goodbye. Krishna! - Brother Nattu ! - Sister Kanta, Krishna is here. Hi, brother Nattu.. - Come on. Hi, brother Nattu.. - Very good. Krishna? Please come. - How are you? greetings. - greetings. Krishna, how are you? - l'm good. l'm absolutely fine. Do you know, they had organized a party for me last night? l cut the cake. Do you know l even danced? Like this. Then, what happened? - Then.. after that.. Krishna? - Dear Krishna, what happened to you? Call the doctor.. - What happened Krishna? l don't remember what happened then. You don't remember.. what do you mean? Sister Kanta, we need to talk to you. You go inside and play.. meet everyone.. - Yes. Brother Nattu.. - Yes, come on. Brother Nattu.. - How are you? - l'm good. Have a seat. What do you want to say? Sister Kanta, whatever you asked us, we told you. But you had to tell us everything about Krishna. Don't you think you have.. - Cheated you. You want to say this, don't you? Yes, l've cheated you. l had to tell you about Krishna's ailment. But Mr. and Mrs. Mehta, he is not suffering from any big ailment.. ..by which his life is in danger. He has epilepsy. But now there are medicines available to cure epilepsy. Just you have to take some extra care. This is what our doctor told us. Sister Kanta, he has lied to you. Krishna is suffering from such ailment, which can never be cured. You are telling, a little care.. ..not a little, but he needs care all 24 hours. He can have an attack anytime and anywhere. Who will stay with him for 24 hours? Why will anybody with him? We took him from here thinking he will support us in our old age. But he himself needs support all the time. One minute.. so, you don't want a child.. Just because you feel that Krishna cannot support you in your old age.. ..you don't want to keep him with you, isn't it? Okay, no problem. No problem at all. l'll take care of my Krishna all the 24 hours.. like you said. l can take care of him. You can leave him here. But Mrs. Mehta, tell me something. lf you had given birth to a child, who was suffering from same ailment.. ..which Krishna is suffering from.. what would've you done? Would you leave him.. ..giving this logic that he can't support you in your old age? Mr. Mehta, you tell me. You wouldn't have left him, right? Because, he was your own son. ..thanks a lot for that. You can leave. - Let's go, Deepali. Sister, my parents. Where did they go? Sister? They left. You'll stay here now. But sister, they are my parents. l want to go with them. Sister, my parents left. - They are not your parents. They are not related to you in anyway. Sister.. lt is too late, go to sleep. Brother Nattu, l cannot sleep.. as l've seen tears in Krishna's eyes. Did you see how sad Krishna's face was.. ..when Mr. and Mrs. Mehta left him here? Sister, you don't get tensed. He will forget them in a couple of days. He will forget? Will he forget? He will not forget anything. He will remember everything and cry. All this happened because of you. Brother Nattu, it is all because of you. You told me not to tell them about Krishna's ailment. Don't say anything. Hiding the truth is equal to lying. Krishna is suffering from epilepsy and this is the truth. We have to live with that truth. lf we would've told them, what would happen? They wouldn't have adopted Krishna. That's all, isn't it? But Krishna or we wouldn't have endured so much pain. lt is a different thing if you are an orphan.. ..but he got parents, but they let go off him after accepting him. Krishna would be heartbroken by this. Do you realize that? l made a mistake. A grave mistake. You are right. All this happened because of me. This happened because of me. l thought.. l was wrong. l was wrong. You can punish me the way you want. No.. brother Nattu, l'm sorry. Brother Nattu, please don't cry. Please, don't cry. ln anger, l told you many things. lt is not only your fault, l'm also a part of it. Whatever you thought was for Krishna's betterment. Our way was wrong, but our intention was not wrong. Please, don't cry. What worse can happen? No one will adopt Krishna.. he will not get parents. ..so much that he'll not think about anyone. Yes. This is right. Today, l guarantee this. ''l looked in the earth, l saw the sky..'' ''l looked in the earth, l saw the sky..'' ''l looked in the whole world.'' ''ln the crowd of this world, where are you lost?'' ''Why did the dream in my eyes shatter?'' ''Why did you leave my hand suddenly?'' ''l stood seeing you helplessly.'' ''Mother, where are you?'' ''l looked for you in the whole world.'' ''Mother, where are you?'' ''l looked for you in the whole world.'' ''Who do l ask here?'' ''Who will tell me?'' ''l've never seen my mother.'' ''l've never seen any affection.'' ''He has seen god who has seen his mother's face.'' ''Mother, where are you?'' ''l looked for you in the whole world.'' ''Mother, where are you?'' ''l looked for you in the whole world.'' You are Krishna, aren't you? Even l'm Krishna. But everyone worship you. They love You. They come to You. They want you to always stay with them.. be with them. But no one wants to keep me with them. Why? After so many days, l met parents, but even they left me. Why did they leave me? Because l have ailment? Why am l sick? Sister says that you give everything to everyone. You gave this ailment to me, didn't you? Why did you give me this ailment? Did you give me so that l don't get parents? Sister told me Your story. You had two parents. l don't have even one. Why is it like that? Everyone say that You are very nice. You help everyone.. but no.. you are not good. You are too bad, Krishna. You are too bad. Krishna, you are too bad. lf l don't get my parents, then l'll never talk to you. l'll never talk to You. You wait and watch. Krishna? - What happened? Who is it? Krishna.. You.. are you calling me?- Yes. Then why can't l see you? - Turn behind and see. ''Hail Lord Krishna.'' ''Hail Lord Krishna.'' Who are you? - l'm Krishna. Who are you? - l'm Krishna. But l'm Krishna. - l'm Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna? Why have you come here? You called me. Krishna, l know everything about you. You know? What do you know? l know everything. A little while ago, whatever you told me.. l know everything. Did you hear everything? - Yes. Whenever somebody calls me wholeheartedly.. ..l come to them. So, even today l had to come for my friend.. as a friend. One minute.. but how do l believe you that you are really Lord Krishna? You tell me, how will you believe me? You do some miracle and show me. Some magic.. - Magic? lf it was someone else, l wouldn't have agreed to him. But l've made you my friend, so l can deny you. Tell me. What do you want to see? Can you make this temple disappear? - Temple? Yes, why not? Here. Wow.. Wow.. he really made it disappear. This is a fairy world. Wow.. it is very beautiful. Krishna.. you are great. You really made that temple disappear. Do you believe me now that l am real? Yes, now l believe you that you are real. Hail Lord Krishna. Sister Kanta's Lord Krishna. lsn't it? Hail Lord Krishna. Hail Lord Krishna. Now l don't have any problem because You are with me. My best friend, aren't you? - Yes, why not? Krishna, shall l go? - You are going? When will you come again? - Again? l'll tell you. Take my flute. Wow.. this is a beautiful flute. Whenever you have to call me, you play this, l'll come. Krishna, l don't know how to play a flute. You know.. - How do You know that l know to play flute? l am telling you, you know to play a flute. Keep them on your lips and see it for yourself. Krishna, l really know to play a flute. - Yes.

See properly, he must be somewhere around. Sister, l saw all the rooms upstairs and downstairs. You don't worry. l will go out and check. Krishna! Krishna! Why are you troubling? Where would he be gone? Krishna! Where did he go early in the morning? lf he goes away from the orphanage.. ..l wonder what will happen to sister Kanta. Krishna! Krishna! Please bring him back to me. Wow. lt is a wonderful flute. Brother Raghu, did you see Krishna? - No, l didn't. You should have take care. Brother Nattu !
