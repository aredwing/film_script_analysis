This is the story of the most famous Looking for the grave. It starts near Cairo, 1900. Ladies and gentlemen. You are in front of Memphis ... the first capital of ancient Egypt. Reconstruction of these walls ... began six years ago. Behind them can be seen ... city of Saqqara ... and the tomb of King socer. It is the oldest building known to mankind. Old is approximately 5,000 years. Now I ask you to follow me. I'll show you the main entrance to the temple. Get out of here, for the ladies here is dangerous. Are you sure that the Here, Mr. Brandon? Yes, Mark Brandon. I'll wait by the car. OK. Continue, continue. Do not stopped. Gore. Mr. Brandon. Fast. Come on. Mr. Brandon. Carefully. Be on your guard. Lady wants to see. Some waited in the camp. It's not the kind of woman. Enough! They say they have found something. They lie. And you do not lie? I do not, sir. Yes, they are lying. I do not lie, I have them done. You wanted to see me? Do not rush. If you want to finish the job and kill this man, go. You saw what he wanted to take. I have participated in several research and it happens often. Really? I would like to explain. Yes, of course. My father said ... You must have heard of him ... Dr. James Barclay. Yes, absolutely yes, he was well known. When they discover something important, they get a prize. And when you hide something, steal others. Mr Brandon, could we talk alone? Yes, go with me. Abdula, please stay awake. This is the first time a woman reaches to talk with me. Drinks? No thanks. G. Brandon, my father was a very religious man. You will not bother me that drink? No, absolutely not! Father's ambition was to confirm ... authenticity of the biblical story. Here in Egypt. You and everyone else have him laughed. But before he died last year ... He talked about how to find authentic evidence. It is a grave. Tomb of the evidence. It is a passage from the Old Testament. I have registered to a Joseph to be authentic. But they did not take any action? No. I came to finish his work. And to prove that he was right. Since you're a believer or Just because you're stubborn? G. Brandon. I brought something safe I will come across something interesting. From 18 dynasty. Pure gold. It comes from an open grave. It comes from the Pharaoh, When Joseph was in Egypt. Someone found it, but it was not an archaeologist. Grave robbers. You can leave. Where did you get? Where did you get this? My father bought it in London. He found that there were other objects from the tomb, but they are sent to ancient stores on the continent. I have not found anything about Joseph, but this tomb to be found. It is a symbol of the Pharaoh Ra-hotep. Reigned for centuries after Joseph. The theory accepted by all. My father did not agree. I think I could be wrong. I have made many excavations in Egypt. And no it did not prove the Bible. Ooops. I see you this does not Mr. Brandon is interested. I think the director of antiquities was wrong. They would take weeks, to do this research. No need. There are other ways. I like the other tracks. If you just find a person who is took the items from these facilities. If you follow it, will know where the grave. And how do you find, I put an ad in the newspaper? If someone walked by the shops in Cairo ... and says that the collector ... in search of artifacts from the tomb of Ra-hotep. I would not have done, I am very well known. I know that you can not. But I have not dared to do it yourself. Mr. Brandon if you want to help me? I'd be very grateful. I did not start anything, if I sure that it can end. I've known your reputation. Everything? A good deal. When do we start? I have already started. I'll wait outside while presvuete clothes. You did not take long! We first go to antique shops. And then we go to dinner together. I'm thinking about all the possibilities. Tonight, I want to talk to my husband. Your wife? Yes, come tonight in Alexandria. He had to stay there, to solve some business issues. Why not earlier in the course of discussing mention of her husband? I could mention. But perhaps we would not have helped. You see, I very well know your reputation. Come on, Mustafa. Welcome, madam. Valentin Arko, at your service. Thank you. Is there any authentic excavated item? Authentic? Here everything is authentic, madam. Everyone knows that my collection second largest ... After the museum in Cairo. You will have an advantage? Jewelry, if you're interested in? It belonged to Cleopatra. I'll give you for half of its value. I have come here in terms of something is bound to the tomb of Ra-hotep. Ra-hotep? Here we have a list of all the royal tombs. It is in the distant past. But I think that it is not in the list. Do you need more details amount to Mr. Arko? I am willing to pay well. Please, sit down, madam. Can I offer you something, coffee, tea, wine? I do not need anything, izvuinite what I asked. Try to understand, ma'am. We deal only with the legal antiquities. Goodbye, Mr. Arko. One moment, please. I'm a little angry that I failed to deliver. Razgovorat'll keep it down. OK, we can talk quietly. What can you offer? You know, it is forbidden to sell stolen goods. But I do not ask me now selling Mr. Arko. Can you give me today. I will be very generous. To what extent? When it comes to proper courtesy ... I will be very generous. I am at Mena Hause. Mrs. Philip Martin. Goodbye. Goodbye, madam. Hamed, of randomness, just I went to look for you. That would spare the embarrassment. How did you know ... I saw a woman that came here I know you asked for. Consider whether you can find it? Will pay what is asked. Do not be stupid. She spoke with the director of Antiquities. Trying to find a trace of the statue, which she bought in London. If you sell anything to her or say, we will all be closed. Anyone who does not love their lives. Hamed, I did not know. But now you know. Outstanding. To date I have not heard of Ra-hotep. And now for less than twenty minutes ... two people have asked me to objects from the tomb. Who was the other person? The man who went from store to store. He went out and crossed the street. I think this was his car. Thank you. We have to see who is driving this car. Hurry, Mustafa. Follow it, do not lose sight of. Quickly, quickly. Stand. The bridge was built. Philip. Ana. What happened? I thought you'd get a night train. Now I know that means staying away from you. And without hesitation, I went in the morning. Mr. Brandon, you know this is my husband. I thought it was. I am very pleased. Also. Drinks? Yes. I asked Mr. Brandon, to examine the notes of my father. We can not waste time. I found that there was still someone else interested in the Ra-hotep. Do you know who? No, but we almost succeeded. We followed the man. To catch him. But his luck ... because the bridge was erected. I did not know, so I was scared. I thought that the tomb-robbers. So you were the man in the car? Yes, I want to tell you not to bother. I was in some antique shops. I wanted to make a surprise. But it's not. Do you want something to take? Whiskey and water. And I thought that you're an American, gos. Brandon. And where are you? My father was a Spaniard, my mother the Italians, and I was born on board in France. To be totally confused. I think it's very romantic. If you do not mind, I would into the bedroom to rest a little. So you get to know better. It's a good idea. Have you ever been to the USA Yes, many times. I spent a life walking around in the world. I acquire things for the American market. Pictures, exotic art. A bit of everything. Yes. Egyptian antiquities? I do not know anything about it. They would interest you to know, Because if you find the grave ... it could be a value around 5 million pounds sterling. Really? The Egyptian government will get half. And according to the will of Dr. Barclay ... Museum in Cambridge, to obtain the other half. Do not get even a penny. Is this what you mean tell me? More or less. Learn how we do for several months. I got married to this girl ... but I think it's just an illusion; If you finish a job that is Her father started. And it is this which has become purpose of my existence. Well, you have a good chance. Perhaps the first man in history ... to find a tomb for his wife! Thank you! She deserves it. My father had a habit of visiting Cairo ... Whenever the full moon. So, when we arrived here the first night ... We spent hours and hours walking around. He said the only way we can stay in touch with the past. She was very much tied to his father. Her mother died when she was a child. And for that reason ... When the other girls learned the alphabet, she studied hieroglyphics. Do you think that this sacred mission. She wanted to achieve his goal. I know what it means to her. I spent the night thinking about how her I say that I am ready to help. Remember me? I am the father of the monastery Anthimos St. Catherine at Sinai. Glad to see you again Father Anthimos. To introduce you to my husband. As you, Father. How are you? I congratulate you. This is economic. Brandon. It's my pleasure. My pleasure, sir. I was told the hotel that you will be here. And when I go tomorrow, I did not want to miss the opportunity ... to express feelings, that we all had ... after learning of the death of your beloved father last year. I appreciate your kindness Priest. We are waiting with impatience your visit. You did not say that your father was in Santa Catarina. I do not know. Yes, he wrote me something shortly before his death. If you want to go there tomorrow. All three, of course. I think that it is not possible. I'll go to the Sinai. Slijediu the same way that people are followed Moses ... in their exodus from Egypt. With a slight change. We cross the Red Sea by boat. Instead I ask that you open to us. I appreciate that this is fascinating. But why not. This will be a wonderful trip. Train, ship, four days on camels. Since that time her father had only one goal, because they hoped to find something in the Sinai. If you think this is worth it. I thought that we could do something good. This is my advice, and it is not Other long time. If you want to be prepared in the morning. At the dawn? Where are you staying? Hotel Mena Hause. I will say that we must go. I greet the Father, and I'm glad. Good night, Father. See you tomorrow. We will soon see the country, better be prepared. Dear Wait, just one song. Stay Ann, I'll pick up the bags. Thank you. We need to be deployed. I admit that I never knew Archaeologists like you. And I have not met arheologovu daughter like you. How did you become? Director of Antiquities, told me that you were an engineer. Engineer? That's funny. I was a digger. How? As you've heard. Simply line a router. I started so I dug a ditch in the U.S. ... and then went into a ditch, called the Suez Canal. And then? One day in Cairo ... I was looking for a way to spend monthly salary. I followed a girl inside the museum. And so it began. She is an archaeologist? I never learned. The first thing I saw ... was a solid gold carriage. It must be worth several thousand pounds. A pile of antique jewelry. Things that I did not know even the name. Things that have enabled me to discover a new world. Then I studied archeology. Then I found out where they dig. I was the most educated thief the profession in the tombs. But not for your father. Why my father? He was a university professor. He said that archeology is not treasure hunt. He made me to understand better. That every time you discover something from the past ... give greater value to this today. Then it all and come true. But now everything is clear. He had to be some reason, When you worry so much about me. Yes, this is the reason. Look! I thought I was a good rider. But never a single trip I was not very difficult as this. You will know why everything is beneficial. This is just an arrogant monster turned around and mocked me. Do not worry, you laugh it. Gos. Brandon. He has a special interest in finding out more. Here is where we camp historic place. Ann, here is a rock, Where Moses ... made a miraculous flow of water. I see that Mr. Brandon, shows a little skeptical. I like facts. You must not forget ... that faith begins where reality is. Potujtujem your philosophy, Father, But I am a scientist. And Americans. For some time I was a fan of his homeland. Not with so much confusion, because I'd lost her own spiritual importance. When were you last there? Years ago. Then you do not have any experience. Let's father. Philip, what is it? I do not know, something I was terribly bitten. Mark. It was a scorpion. They are poisonous, and deadly. Give me the bottle. Let's see. Quiet lying down. It does not look good for now. I have to hack into. Keep breathing. Hold on. I have a bottle of whiskey in my tent. Please. Well, Doc. It was a successful operation? Because of this, you will be able to move next week. Stay here with Ann. I will continue with his father Anthimos. No, this trip was important for her. And I do not like to miss. Okay, moving on to the camels. Do not cut more than need? Who knows, maybe such a radical cut with a knife a little more. You do not love me. Not much. How are you? Well, well. Good. I'll call you for a drink soon. Thank you for having me do not lose sight of. You can be sure, Philip. I will not lose her sight. And the Lord went to Mount Sinai. And the LORD called Moses to climb to the top of the mountain. And Moses went up. And God began to speak, saying to him: I am the supreme god, your god. What have you brought me from the land of Egypt ... and done to rid us of slavery. For Moses, it was very comforting ... to live in the shadow of the mountain, where his ten commandments izdiktirane. It's so easy to find confirmation of all ... when it was the biblical mountains of Sinai. Keep your faith my daughter. This is the key to all doors. Father Milos, good morning. Welcome Father Anthimos. Turn. For 12 centuries, we are I try to open the door. We can open them in any century. I'd rather be. Last time when I was here, I went twice. Three times, if I remember correctly. They have a cart for two people. Philip? No, go up Mark. I will raise with her father Anthinosom. Father Milos. Turn. Since you know Philip? From a year ago, why? Just asking. Careful father. Imagine a father, that wonderful goal ... find the grave of the first rulers of the earth. For all who believe in one God. I wish I can help. I'm sure Dr. Barclay, never mentioned the Ra-hotep. Sorry Mark. We have seized a lot of time, We stopped and your business. Forget it. If nothing at least we rode a camel! Can you transfer a number of philosophical observations ... to lift the spirit. But I admit that the glass wine more convincing. We are very proud of our wine. You'll never taste anything like, like this. Ah, you've experienced this last time, When you were here, remember? Yes, I fainted. Just remember that my father gave a sip of wine. Where were we? In a very dark place, similar to a dungeon. This was the beneficiary. Final resting place for all monks, who were killed in St. Catarina. Dr. Barclay has to be very interesting. Would you like to visit? I am very interested. So go ahead, I'll take the key. No, better to rest the leg. You have the right doctor. I hope that you will not faint again. I'll try. I feel calm knowing What is the effect of this delicious wine. Holy Estefan. According to our data, there is lived in the 7th century. Often we think ... whether there can be any unknown explanations relating to him in these pieces. Perhaps you could let us be Guide gos. Brandon. No, this is written in Cuneiform and encouraged to place many centuries ago. Now I remember. This is where I passed out. My father stood there, exactly. He read the chips. This is the beginning of this letter. The most powerful ruler in the world ... humble servant of the king. That's all it says. This is one of them? No. Tiles are still here? Yes, there is a suitcase full of them. My father came here after have I fainted? No! Then, they can not read ... i did not mention Ra-hotep. I even bought the statue. He felt that the evidence that he required, are in this case. Mark was right. This is evidence that is sought here. All are written for the Ra-hotep. This is dated. They all come from the 18th dynasty. When Joseph was in Egypt. Maybe. I have something conclusive. From this dynasty ... all pharaohs were buried in the Valley of the Kings. There will be hard to find this tomb. There is no doubt that it opened. Did you find something? Yes, Philip, yes. We know where it is. In the Valley of the Kings. Mark, look. Someone is digging here. Yes, there are those partially explored ... and it is all marked on the map. I know you are still in grave near the rocks. Could it not be that she still? No, no chance. Come on, we still have more than halfway. There is no reason to stay in Luxor. We can take the night train return to Cairo. Do not even consider that he had discovered something and that it wants to hide from us? Philipe. Given that we know nothing about him. He reveals a treasure for years. If he had no intention ... We steal the credit. He wants to collect all the glory, instead of your father. What happened? Again you have a disagreement? Yes, if you're concerned about it. But that has nothing to do with you. To yield to your husband, not me. Sorry Mark. Do not be discouraged, not yet. What we are looking for can take whole life. But it's worth. Thanks, Mark. Thank you for supporting me. Do not talk back to me about it. Patience is not one of my virtues. Come in. What do you want? One gentleman told me that contacting Ms. Martin. What gentleman? I do not know his name. He said that he can help to find what you are looking for. Why not come? I do not think so. And you have to get yourself. It is an honor for me, madam. Please. Sit down, wine is delicious. You have accepted the invitation? I'd rather not came, not in terms of such a quest. OK. Yesterday I met a person that you can provide information to you brought to the tomb of Ra-hotep. Interested? Why did not you go yourself? Because I value my life. And you can get protection from the police. I remember you once told me ... you are very generous woman. I went to the hotel and they told me you are in Luxor. For how much money? I have here ready check. This is your bank, right? You are very well informed. Sign it quickly, or I'll quickly go. A few years ago ... appeared in Egypt a man named Campos. He had no money. I suddenly became a millionaire. They say that the smuggling ... objects from the tomb of Ra-hotep. Of course, we had just heard. We deal only with the legal antiquities. Save me the details. Where is this man? Where is it? He's dead. He was killed two years ago. But yesterday I found out the name of a guide, which led him to the place where the grave. Salam, Salam Hamed. Nomad. Nomad? Where can I find it? With people in this desert area. They come to buy food in Tabur. It is south of Luxor, You will find it on the map. Hamed Salam Tabur. Good luck. Who will protect me from the police, Mr Arko? We know that these items delivered from Egypt. Not for Hamed Salama. No, for someone else. Who? I do not know. Here in Luxor Mr. Arko. This is the man who killed Campbell. And he will kill you. If you have just discovered that we sell the information? I told everything I know, everything. Only if he does not fall into the hands of police. You should not worry. Think about it Mr. Arko. The day when you were in my shop ... when you went, came a man. Tall with a beard. He had a stick with a bat. Have you seen it? No, I did. His name is Hamed, Hamed Backhour. It is possible to stay at your hotel. Thank you, Mr Arko. You're welcome. We have to go tomorrow. But you will need time to find guides that will take you to Tabur. There are a lot of bellicose tribes on the road. I'll pay double. I will give an additional 20 pounds ... If you can start tomorrow. I'll get my best people. Good night. Good night. You might think it would be cheaper for your money. Ann, are you satisfied? Sure. No, think a bit. Ann has done several times already. Why do they traveled five days to find someone a clue? If the thief found here. And if we could find Hamed, how do we take data from it? The police have their own methods. We have no evidence. And he will realize that it was issued. Vtatit I will be back in the grave as soon as possible. Well, the two agree. Dear, I could not sleep. I went down to drink something. Your husband Philip. Valentine. Valentine. I told you that you will return to see the English. I have not seen. Hamed did nothing, nothing. He is still looking for artifacts from the tomb of Ra-hotep? I do not know anything Hamed. I swear. I brought one for you, Valentin. You have done me a great service ... telling me that the coyote in Luxor. Also, I myself have done a great service. It turned out that you can trust. I could not control his mind. Of course not. A strange kind of dedication to work, that rushes at night. We are no longer strangers, we are partners. I'll give you a satisfying portion. I'll pick up objects and carry them to Europe. A ten percent of the sale is yours. That was, until now. A witness to murder. Maybe the police to be interesting. I want half of what was in the grave. This is faster and safer than a knife. Give it to me, please. How long will it take to get all present from the grave? I do not know. Maybe a week if no one can not be bothered. Nobody will bother you. I can guarantee you. Thank you. You know what they say? That Egypt is a man without a woman. Why say so? During the day warm and cold at night. It can also be said Women without men. That way, I have no knowledge. Why did you shoot? I saw them, they came with covered face on camels. Huge, huge. What? If you were on camels and their faces were covered ... It may be just the Tuareg tribe. Tuareg. They were expelled from Algeria by the French Foreign Legion. They attack the caravan. I never heard that they acted in this way. And you? Never. You may not leave the wagon. Do not waste time looking for them around. I better get back to Luxor. What if they are traced, wherever we go. Well, it's better to go forward. Ann. How about Mark? Same as you. Give me your gun. I've never heard of any ruins here. Unless they are covered with sand. Let's try to get to these ruins. Hamed, come with me and bring a camel with water. We must stay here until tomorrow. Philip could be injured. It's impossible to find at night. Guide. Yesterday we passed a ravine three miles away. Those who came were saved. The only city here near the Tabur. We should arrive there today, that we are not prevented by the storm yesterday. Ann, listen to me. Ann. Open your eyes. Stand up. You have to continue? I told you many times about strength of your father. Come on what happened, where is thy sting? You can speak their language. I've used it, while I lived in Cairo. I know all about all the customs of civilization. Our camp was destroyed by a desert storm. And we started to look Tabur nomads ... named Hamed Salam. Yes, they told me. Would you like to sell food and water? We will pay whatever you want. Why are you looking for the nomads? They said it was a very experienced guide. We are archaeologists. Are you famous? No. These items go in your favor. I know many archaeologists. And I have a good opinion about them. This is the man you are looking for. Hamed Salam. It is not always covered his face. Like me, Hamed Salam is civilization known. He stayed at the Luxor. I was a guide. One day he came to camp a man named Campbell. Archaeologist like you. With the help of Hamed, found treasure. Show how much you paid for. No. None of our people will not You see, Hamed. Show. No, no. Campos was afraid to speak, and silenced forever. However, Hamed Salam survived. It was a big disappointment for him, but they did not want revenge. Another man was killed Campbell. Perhaps another archaeologist. No, another pirate like Campos. Like all who rob graves. It is a sacrilege. We will not try to cheat. We hope to find the grave with evidence that confirms the Bible. It is important to us. Your Koran is like our Bible. Our prophets of your origin. Do not listen to them. They speak broken language. But if you tell them the truth, will help them. serve Allah. Lie, just longing for gold. Maybe you're right. Maybe not. Come on, let them wait. We live under the sign of the sword. This is our defense, entertainment and law. When a person accused of a crime ... The sword is his judge. If the accused gives victory ... This means that he is innocent. If he loses, he is guilty. Allah will decide. You are accused of lying. They will fight against you in the face with an opponent, in accordance with our customs. But I've never used a sword. I can fight with weapons, with their hands. Their civilization has not changed methods. It is not by me nor by Hamed Salam. We will change our for you. I wanted to see if the lady wants something to drink. We have no choice. That's all we have. I think this is fermented goat's milk. Our good friend head We saved him personally. I hope you are not a lot of dazed, because you have to ask some questions. Who was the first man who came here after the death of your father? Philip? This is why ... Here came Campos. I do not know how to find the grave. Better to wait for morning so that continue the investigation. He does not mention. Never tomb discovered here, is not it? No, none that I know. Must be here in the vicinity. Now I must go. Here in the vicinity of the city, where There are many ships. From there you can board the ship, which leads to the Luxor. Thank you Hamed Salam. Allah will protect you. And you should follow. Well, let's take a look. Look at this. Seal of Ra-hotep. It seems to me that someone wanted to take content at high speed. It is possible that Campos did not disclose the grave. Perhaps the items found in another grave and they were brought here. How anyone could take consider this shelter? Tourists come here often. No, Abu Simbel was once holy place. Is guarded day and night by priests. A thief could not find a safer place. It was then the grave robbers? Yes, because he bribed the priests the temples. Mark, be careful. Maybe there's someone out there. There must be a loose stone. Or a fake wall somewhere. I do not know ... maybe it all. Wait. See, between two statues. It must have been in, let's go. Here we certainly have company. Is it safe? Do not worry. I was hoping your visit. You do not take long for me find Mark. Will you be away to get me out there? Thank you. My colleague, He found out the trap. He took the tree and pulled the rope. I had to use a bullet. Do not move. I was in the dark two days and I see like a bat. I said not to move. Stay where you are. Be quiet or you'll get shot. Philip. Why do not you shoot? Or you do not have bullets. See, this is the temple of Philae. Ann, look at this. Ra-hotep, eternal rest ... in the shadow of King Amenhotep. This is better than the map. The tombs in the Valley of the Kings ... close Amenhotep. On the self had no mark, digging. Certainly there are bandits for centuries. We will send my manager in Luxor. No, that was enough. I want to go away soon. I never return to Seneca. I know you've all suffered, but ... ... Now you can not let go. We are never supposed to even start. It has cost many lives. First my father. After him, other people. And now Philip. He got what he deserved. I can not throw him out of my head. I think I forced him to come with me ... perhaps would never do anything wrong. We can not blame Mark. OK, we are sinners. We pay for our sins ... carry the guilt of others, does not it? Mark you are not allowed to say so. Consider whether you can be based our happiness to so many accidents. No, but why you still So stubborn ... So when you constantly talk about others. Your mistake is that you discredited. I do not dare to admit. Imagine that there is something strange and the supernatural in this matter. And you want to escape. But it will not do. I told you once, you never I do not accept the job ... If I'm not sure that I'll finish it. Well ... I'll be back in the Valley of the Kings. And thou shalt go with me. Do we turn back. Abdula. I want you to lunch. You will dine at the top of the feet in water, If you do not perform a my orders. I told people to get out of the ditch. Do you have other orders. Who gave? Mark, I was told to continue working. I do not know why I have a good feeling. They are already whole ten yards deep. Come see this. Looks like the beginning of the stone staircase. Abdula. Bring your group immediately. Mark, are you sure it's Ra-hotep? No doubt. We found him. We will go with you to help. Please gentlemen. Please do not rush a lot of information. Have a little patience. If history is waiting for three thousand years ... what is important is that it can not wait another half hour. Good luck. Thanks Abdul. These are probably the tools, Thieves have used. This is the 18th dynasty. They came here before about three thousands of years. See, this is the place it was found the crate. Imagine what was in it. The statue of gold. I hope that I have found the tomb. Not much else, right? Everything, except what is not could carry. It must be that it has something to do with Joseph. Ra-hotep, the Governor of Upper and Lower Egypt ... and the entire country, where the sand meets the sky. Is that all? Mark, look. God is the sun. Jackal. Snake. Aries. Ra-hotep, believed in any god. We will not find anything that here refers to Joseph. However, we discovered something important. You can not imagine what it's Ann? No. The only thing that proves you were right. No, my father was right. OK, we owe it to discovery. But I admit that we have so far ... done blindly. This man tried to get here several thousand years ago. And when he tried this a wall fell on him. It is also designed ... that no thief could not enter through this door ... and come next. Yes, of course, to the second door. There may be the same trap. No, no chance. This gate is located on a rock. What is needed is to find the axis of gravity. Watch out. Something happened to you? Nothing. Mark look. What pictures! I've never seen anything like that. There are no hawks or snakes, or jackals. Indicates that the Ra-hotep, believed in one God. Therefore, it is built into this secret chamber. He knew that he would return to Egypt their old customs. I wanted to leave to posterity, As proof of his faith. Those who came from the East as a slave ... sjedie on the right hand of Pharaoh. This saved Egypt during the seven years in which wheat is grown. Seven years of famine. Yes, Joseph. Good. I still think we should finish this trip? I'm sorry Mark, I was wrong. You were right again. The past is there. Walking ahead of our feet will not stumble. Should continue. Yes, Mark, With you forever
