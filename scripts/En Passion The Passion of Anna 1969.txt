The roof has long been in disrepair, and after the autumn rains, it started leaking in earnest. Hi, Johan! How are you? Pretty good. - How's the bronchitis? - Not good. I have a bottle of cough syrup you can have. Thanks. Stop by one day... ...so we can sit down and chat. I must go to the post office before they close. Let's get together soon. Bye. Good afternoon. My name is Anna Fromm. I need to make a call, but our phone's not working. You can use mine. - Please come inside. - Thanks. - Over there. - Thanks. Thanks. Stockholm, 400979. Let me know how much it costs. Hi, Elis, it's Anna. Sorry to disturb you. Could you find out something for me? Andreas deposited money when the boy was born. I need that money now. He didn't? Why not? You were going to help him. We talked about it. I don't understand. This is not an ordinary transaction! It means a lot to me. It's not just the money! Elis... Yes. See you tonight. I found out what the call costs. Don't worry about it. Come again. Use the phone whenever you like. Von Sydow. Take four. Max, as an actor, what is your personal view of Andreas Winkelman? I think he's difficult, because... ...he's trying to hide from the outside world. His failed marriage and legal problems have driven him into a blind alley, where he tries to conceal his identity. He's trying to wipe out his means of expression. And this hiding place, without him being aware of it, has become a prison. The hard thing as an actor is to express the lack of expression. "Dear Anna, "I can't live with you anymore. "I've tried to deny it for a long time, because I love you." "I cannot and will not live with you anymore. "I don't believe in trying, "as neither of us wants to change. "I won't give in, "because I know we'll run into new problems, "which will result in a nervous breakdown and psychological and physical violence." We'll run into new problems, which will result in a nervous breakdown and psychological and physical violence. "Therefore, I ask you not to contact me. Yours truly, Andreas." Is Mrs. Fromm home? She has a cold. She's in bed. She forgot her purse. I can take care of it. Won't you come in for a brandy? Thanks, but I need to go. Please come again. Let's see if we can find something nice for you. Have a taste of this. What have they done to you? I'm sorry. I thought something was wrong. No. I'm fine. I can't sleep at night. Sometimes I fall asleep in the middle of the day. Forgive me for waking you. Bye. Goodbye for now. This meeting resulted in an invitation to dinner. Without knowing why, he accepts and dresses up. The atmosphere is sincere, friendly, and openhearted. He feels a sudden affection for these people. You all look so nice. I'm not used to this. I'm not a hermit, as Elis says. I enjoy meeting new people. I only see the old neighbors. - It's great having you here. - Hope you don't get tired of us. No. When I was a girl, I thought God had a beard. I remember sitting in my father's lap. We read a book called "Light" about the creation. There was a picture of God flying above the earth. He had his arms out like this. He had no wings. He was close to the earth's surface. He was awfully good-looking, with a big beard. This made me believe in God, even if my parents didn't. But I had seen Him in the book. Do you believe in God now? Do I believe in God, Elis? Maybe not in the printed word, either. No, but I believe in God. Would you tell your children about God? I wouldn't teach them to believe in God. I don't think I could handle children at all. - Yes, you could. - No. It's hard because... You'd let them make up their own minds, perhaps? Yes, I think so. When I go to Milan to create a cultural center, I want you to come and visit. It's a very interesting city, a huge city full of incredibly ugly, common, repulsive people. - That's mean! - I'm sorry. They will be given the opportunity of cultural activity. You must come and see this become a reality, a formidable monument over... ...cultural affectation. Of course I can do it. - Is it really a cultural building... - It is. It is. How can you despise your work? I don't. I find it exceptionally important so I can satisfy your needs, especially the financial ones. Why did you take this job? I like designing houses. I'm a distinguished architect. I was flattered by the offer. Many reasons... What does a cultural center involve? It's a mausoleum over the utter meaninglessness in which our kind of people live. Why do you make fun of it? Why do you build it without believing in it? What's the purpose? I'd be idle. What about you? Idle? I do what I believe in. I try to live in the truth. How do you know what is right? You know inside what is true and what is right. We fail sometimes, but I want to strive for spiritual perfection. Do you fail often? I haven't failed in what has been most important for me... living together with my husband Andreas. Do you know why I didn't fail? Because we lived in harmony by being truthful. We were honest. We believed in each other. If I had the same attitude toward my marriage as you have toward your cultural center, I wouldn't have any beautiful memories. I wouldn't believe in anything. ...because I know we'll run into new problems, which will result in a nervous breakdown and psychological and physical violence. How will you get home tonight? You can sleep here. Can't he? Let's have some coffee. Do you want some coffee? Andreas! Elis! Anna's having a nightmare. Last year, I bought the land down to the sea. - It's beautiful. - We have some privacy here. Did you hear something last night? Yes, I woke up briefly. It was Anna. She still has nightmares after the accident. I understand. Let's go to the mill. - This is the place. Come in. - Oh! In the beginning, I collected all kinds of pictures, those I took myself and those from newspapers, magazines, and old photo albums. They're always about people. Here we have people eating. Amazing. People asleep, people in the grip of violent emotions in different sections. Once I collected only pictures of violent acts. Please sit down. Thanks. I've catalogued them according to behavior. An irrational classification, just as meaningless as the collecting itself. There are faces, close-ups. I took them myself. Some of them are interesting. Do you mind if I take some pictures of you? Not at all. I would be flattered. I have all the time in the world. Great. Here it is. This might interest you. Anna Fromm, 23 years old, happily married, seven years before the catastrophe. No picture of her husband? Yes, of course. It would be interesting to see what he looked like. Here you are. Here he is. What sort of person was Andreas? They said he was a scientific genius, but he never got a chance to prove it. He was good-natured and ruthless at the same time. - Care for a drink? - Yes, please. - Whiskey? - Yes, please. Maybe it's too early. Not today. - Ice? - No, thanks. We were friends back in high school, but I never knew him that well. He was a disaster for Anna. - Here you go. - Thanks. She was madly in love with him. I've never seen anything like it. I might only have read about it. I think he also loved her, in his peculiar way. I'm not qualified to judge. For a year, my wife was his mistress. I'm not complaining. I knew about it. She left him one day. I don't know why. I don't dare ask why. What was I going to say? Oh, yes, I want to tell you... Eva... ...has extraordinary mental stamina... ...though you wouldn't think so to look at her. It has never occurred to me. She and Anna have been inseparable for many years. That's how it is. Now you know. Do I hear anything? No, not a sound. Not a damn thing. Do you hear what I'm saying? Andreas! Winkelman! Damn it! Get up! You can't sit here. Get up! Do you want me to kick you? Sit down. I'll make you some coffee. Go to hell! Liv Ullmann, take seven. I sympathize a lot with Anna's need for truth. I understand why she wants the world to be a certain way. But her need, this desire for truth, is dangerous. When she realizes her surroundings don't fit, when she doesn't get the response she demands, she takes refuge in lies and dissimulation. That's why it's so hard to be honest... you expect others to be the same. We see that today in thousands of people. I've been alone for three days. I'm bored to tears. So I came by to say hi. So nice of you. You can always tell me to leave. Do you want to show me around? Yes, I'd love to. - So nice. - It's my office. - Have you read them all? - Almost. Just show-off books? - What's in here? - The kitchen. Where do you sleep... in here? Here's the bedroom. Looks deserted. Anna canceled at the last minute. She's going to have an operation on her leg. The fourth time. She was in a car accident. Her husband and son were killed. She was hospitalized for several months. I guess you know about it. It happened nearby. Is this where your wife worked? - It's just as she left it. - Are you divorced? Yes, sort of. - Was I indiscreet? - Not at all. - Will she come back? - Perhaps. Do you miss her very much? I'm sorry for being tactless. Are you hungry? A geologist friend of mine used to make fun of me because I'm scared of going into caves. More ham? No, thanks. That's one of my oldest albums. I get horrible claustrophobia. I always have. When I was in school, I dreamed about going into one of those French caves. But it didn't happen. - Do you like the music? - Yes. Elis hates it when I dance. He gets embarrassed. Elis is awfully tired of me. - I don't think so. - He is. I'm just a small part of his general weariness. The world is indifferent to his sarcasm, but I'm not. I just want to get even. I don't know what to do. Elis is fantastic. Yes. I like him very much. The worst of it is that I love him. Really love him. There's no other word for it. I don't know how to show him my love. What will become of us? Why do these things happen? What kind of poison corrodes the best in us, leaving only the shell? I'm so tired. Really? This wine makes me sleepy. I agree. Do you mind if I sleep here? You can sleep in the bedroom. Or on the sofa. - I'm not disturbing you? - Not at all. I haven't slept all night, just wandered around. Here's a nice warm blanket. - Thanks. - Here we go. - There. - That's nice. Come here. He will keep you warm. There you go. - Are you comfortable? - Oh, yes. I must have slept for a couple of hours. Can I borrow your phone? I need to call Elis. He's out at dinner. Sure. I'll bring you the lamp. Here it is... - Here you are. - Thanks. - Do you want to be alone? - No. Hi, darling. Sorry to call you so late. You're eating already? Should I call you back? No? I fell asleep. No, not at all. I'm fine. I was out for a walk and ran into Andreas. No, I'm alone now. Everything's fine. Take care for now. Are you coming on Thursday? I'll meet you at the airport. Think of me. Bye. Was it silly of me to say I was lonely? No. He would kill me if he knew I was here. I must look terrible. Can I borrow a comb and mirror? They're in the bedroom. - So dark. - Yes. Let me turn on the lights. Elis is not jealous. Or is he? He's going to Milan. He should be grateful. He's successful. Forever and ever. Amen. It's hard to realize one day that you're meaningless. Nobody needs you, while there you are, wanting to give of yourself. I suppose it's my own fault, but it's paralyzing. I want to accomplish so much and make plans. When I talk to Elis, he says, "Don't do that, do this." And nothing happens. I shouldn't blame Elis. Everything goes wrong for me. And Elis, he... I shouldn't blame him. Hello? - Hi, this is Elis. - Hi. I've tried to call home, but nobody answered. She's usually awake. I'm worried. Can you check if everything's okay? Please tell Eva I was worried. She doesn't need to call me. Call me back and let me know how she is. I was pregnant once. I couldn't sleep at all. They put me in the hospital so I could sleep. By mistake, they gave me too strong of an injection. I didn't fall asleep, and the child died. Elis stayed with me, and we cried together. Elis cried, too. It never happened before and hasn't since. I never had any more children. It's better that way. Do you have to go? Have you noticed how ugly I am? Look at me, Andreas. Have you ever slept with a more boring lover? Tell me I'm wrong! You're wrong. You've been so kind to me. I'll miss you. We'll meet again soon. Don't be afraid. I don't want to miss the ferry. Will you call me? Or you can write. I'll do my best. When are you coming back? In two weeks for Easter with Anna and Elis. - Please come alone. - I don't think so. - Just for a few days. - I'll try. Look here... Come here. - Look after him. - Should I? Yes. You can have him. Then you'll sleep better. It was obvious there was a madman on the island. Olsson found eight of his sheep killed and mutilated. The police make an inquiry. They discover other cases of animal cruelty. Andreas tells the police how he found his puppy. Rage and suspicion flare up all over the island. You can bury the animals now. I met one of the policemen on the ferry yesterday. They have no lead, but... ...the locals suspect Johan Andersson out at Skir. He's been in a mental institution, and that alone is suspicious. He is totally isolated, never speaks, and has no pets. I photographed him a few years ago. I found the pictures. Here they are. He was quite sociable back then but got involved in a lawsuit, which he lost. Since then, he lives like a hermit. I've been thinking about your financial situation. The loan you wanted me to sign... That would be... I think I can help you. - Does the light bother you? - No. My lawyer can devise an installment plan. I would be very grateful. Is it hot? No. There's just one little problem. You need to make some money in order to pay the installments. Any suggestions? No. We're not in a hurry right now. While you're thinking it over, maybe you'd like to type up my notes. I researched that Milan project. That's a good idea... Turn your head a little bit to the left but look straight into the camera. Lower your chin. Now turn your head slowly to the right. A little bit more. Hold it! Hold it. Thanks. - Whiskey? - No, thanks. Do you mind if I have a drink? No. I don't believe I can reach into the soul with my photography. I can only register an interplay of forces large and small. Then I look at the picture and let my imagination go. It's just nonsense. Games, poems. You can't read another person with any claim to certainty. Not even physical pain gives you a particular reaction. She didn't know I took this picture. She had a migraine attack. That's damned interesting. Sorry to disturb you. Here's the mail. Falkman wonders which thermostats... He should be able to fix it. Keep Andreas company. Andreas? Yes? I want you to know I'm not angry or jealous. Anna has told me about you two. I think she's in love with you. I think so, but it's hard to be sure about her feelings. I'm fond of you both. I'm fond of you. I think about you all the time. My dear. My dear. Be careful with Anna. I can't explain what I mean, but be careful. What's wrong? You look angry. It's always small things that make me lose my temper. Shall we continue, or are you tired? No, not at all. - When will lunch be ready? - In an hour. Bye. You've been in prison? Yes, I've been in prison. And? I panicked. I was convicted of forging checks. Then I was pulled over for speeding while drunk. Then I hit a policeman right in his face. Now you hide like a scared dog. I'm a scared dog. - Do you bite? - You'll find out. No, I don't think so. Anna and Andreas have been living together for a few months. She is a translator, and he has accepted Elis'proposal. They are moderately happy, with no arguments or passion to speak of. It is late winter. One day Anna starts talking about her marriage. We lived in perfect harmony. We thought the same thoughts. We understood each other. Do you understand? I know it sounds silly and exaggerated when I tell it, but it's very hard to describe how two people can grow so close. It sounds so trite and doesn't really express what we had together. The boy was an amazing experience for us, and everything about him. I passed my finals and got a teaching job, and Andreas became an associate professor. We bought a little house out of town and furnished it by degrees. We built something together. I don't know what to call it. Real security. Security. Everybody thought it was a perfect marriage, but it wasn't. We had violent fights, but we were never suspicious of or cruel to one another. We were completely honest. There wasn't a vestige of pretense in our relationship. Andreas was unfaithful once. You didn't think so? But he was. He came straight to me and told me, and I felt how much he loved me and forgave him. Then we cared for each other even more. The worst thing was when he left me. I found out where he was, then he changed his mind and came back to me. And then we were closer than ever before. We stayed on the island one weekend with our little boy. Eva and Elis loaned us their house. On Sunday, Andreas took a nap after lunch. I wanted to take the car and see the church ruins. I got my way, and we set off. Andreas asked me to drive, as he'd had a couple of drinks. I didn't drive fast at all. We were all in high spirits. The road was slippery and the car began to skid. Andreas tried to take the wheel... ...but the car shot off the road down into the ditch and smashed through a stone wall and into the trees. When I woke up, I saw the wreck of a car... and a man in it with his throat cut and half his body through the windshield. A boy lay farther away. He had been thrown out the door, and his head was in a strange position. I remember thinking, "What a horrible accident." I wondered why nobody came to help those poor people. I made my way up to the road and began to feel a pain in my side and my leg. I found myself dragging one foot behind me. Then I saw that I was covered in blood. It was everywhere. My shinbone poked through my stocking. They found us a few hours later. I never thought life would be like this. I never thought life would be a daily suffering. ...and psychological and physical violence. Are you stuck? Can we help? They'll kill me. Why? Because of cruelty to animals. This came hurtling through the window. "You damn animal killer. We'll do to you what you did to the animals." Through that window... Me, cruel to animals? I can speak to the police. They've been here already. Can't you go away? Where would I go? - Surely something can be done. - What? Let me adjust the antenna... That's good. There. Was that a bird? It might be hurt. Let's take a look. I'll get the flashlight. You'd better put it out of its misery. Could it have survived? No. It was too badly injured. Now we can see better. I wonder why the bird was flying alone at night. Perhaps it was afraid of something. Admit that you and Eva had an affair last fall. Actually, we didn't. Eva is so defenseless. Anyone can do what they like with her. She doesn't have to defend herself against me. I think Eva is a woman who can't stand the fact that she has no identity. She's just a creation of others. She has no peace of mind or self-worth. I think she will try to commit suicide. Suicide isn't a solution. It's just another selfish action. I hope she'll be saved. I hope, when she wakes up... ...she will have gone through something that releases her from herself, and that she can look at her old self with love but without remorse. I think she'll decide to become a teacher for people who are hearing-impaired, because deaf people live in a deeper isolation than she has ever done. I think she will feel relieved... ...and blessed. And then? That's all. I exist here merely as a formality. The lamp is going out. No. You're strangling me. The warning signs are beneath, and they manifest themselves unexpectedly. Anna recalls a long, coherent dream which troubled her at Easter. I was walking alone. I felt a terrible longing for companionship, for someone's arms around me, for rest. At the same time, I knew this was gone forever. Can I come home with you? No. We are forbidden to have guests. We've changed the locks. Why? I don't know. - Can't you stay? - No, I need to go. Stop! I don't know where I am. What is this place? Can you please help me? Who is that woman? Her son is going to be executed. She is on her way to the execution. Forgive me. Can we have a word with you, sir? Yes. Please, come in. Johan Andersson at Skir has been found dead, and he left this letter for you. When did it happen? We found him today, hanged. He had ugly bruises on his head, and seemed to have been beaten up. Do you want to know what the letter says? Yes, sir, and we'd like the letter back. "Dear Andreas. A few hours ago, some people came by. "They told me I was a criminal and had to be punished. "They dragged me by the hair out into the yard. "There they beat me with their fists and spat on me. A younger one took a stone and hit me in the head." "I was confused and told them I was innocent. They said that if I confessed they would leave me alone." "I said I would confess." "Then they stopped hitting me in the face. "They pushed me up against the wall and told me to talk. "I said everything they wanted to hear. "When I couldn't think of any more, they hit me again. One of them stood over me and..." "...pissed on my face. I couldn't cover my myself because I was too tired." "They kicked me as I was lying there. They stepped on my glasses, and I lost my false teeth..." "...and I couldn't find them." "I can't recall what happened next, as I fainted. When I woke up, they'd left in their cars and..." "...I walked back inside. I didn't want to live anymore..." "...because I could no longer look anyone in the eye." "That's why I can't go on living. "Dear Andreas, I'm writing this letter to you "because you've always been good to me and always wondered how I was doing." "Truly yours." Thank you, sir. That's all. Can I get it back? Yes, sir, when the investigation is through. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Anna? Oh, there you are. What are you doing? I'm praying for Johan. You're praying for yourself. Go away! Leave me alone! Damn lousy acting! Damn acting! It looks like a pigsty. That's not worth keeping. That might come in handy. You can have it. It was Grandpa's. I'll keep the radio. Good afternoon. I got a letter from Johan. Really? Anna and Andreas have lived a year in relative harmony. There have been arguments and reconciliations due to misunderstandings or bad temper, but the arguments were never too hurtful. Anna got a translation job, and Andreas kept working for Elis. I have a headache. Maybe I've caught a cold. I'll make you something hot. That's nice of you. I'll just finish up this chapter. It's quite exciting. You have cancer of the soul. You need an operation and radiation. You have tumors everywhere. You'll die a horrible death. - What are you doing? - Looking at a photograph. I hope it's not an old flame. What makes you think that? A penny for your thoughts. I'm thinking about cancer, and it terrifies me. What are you thinking about? Nothing. - I'm thinking about the lies. - What lies? We should take a trip somewhere. We should get away from here. It would do us both good. I really want to say yes. What are you thinking about? I could ask Elis to lend us the money. But at the same time, there's a wall. I can't speak or show you that I'm happy. I can see your eyes, but I can't reach you. Do you understand? I understand. I'm outside that wall. I've shut myself out. I'm so far away that... I know how strange it feels. It's strange. I want to be warm and tender and alive. I want to be free. It's like being in a dream. You want to move, but you can't. Your legs and arms are as heavy as lead. You try to talk but can't. I'm afraid of being humiliated. It's like hell. I've accepted the humiliation and let it sink in. Do you understand? I understand. It's terrible to be a failure. Some people think they have the right to tell you what to do... contempt with good intention. A brief desire to trample something living. I understand. You don't have to... I'm dead. No, that's too melodramatic. I'm not dead. But I live without self-respect. I know it sounds silly and pretentious. Most people live without any self-esteem. Humiliated at heart, stifled, and spat upon. They're alive and that's all they know. They know of no alternative. Even if they did, they would never reach out for it. Can one be sick with humiliation? Is this a disease we have to live with? We talk so much about freedom. Isn't freedom a poison for the humiliated? Or is it merely a drug the humiliated use in order to endure? I can't live like this. I've given up. I can't stand it anymore. The days drag by. I'm choked by the food I swallow, the shit I get rid of, the words I say. The daylight screams at me every morning to get up. Sleep is only dreams that chase me. The darkness rustles with ghosts and memories. Has it ever occurred to you that the worse off people are, the less they complain? Finally they're silent... ...even if they're living creatures with nerves, eyes, and hands. Vast armies of victims and hangmen. The sun rises and falls, heavily. The cold approaches. The darkness. The heat. The smell. They're all silent. We can never leave. It's too late. Everything's too late. I believe Elis thinks it's hypocrisy to be horrified at human folly... ...and a waste of feelings to call for decency and justice. He won't allow other people's suffering to keep him awake at night. He thinks he's indifferent in his own and others' eyes. Those are the conditions under which he lives, otherwise he couldn't function. What are you doing today? - What are you doing? - I don't know. I asked you. Do you realize that it's over? Answer me! If you don't give me a reason, I have nothing to say. You're free to go whenever you like. You're lying. You lied about your marriage. You lied about your divorce. I know the truth about you. Really? I know what you're like. You're a parasite. I don't like you at all. It's hell living with you. I've been longing to get out. Poor Anna. You were so happy before we met. At least I had good memories of my husband and our love. What about now? - I lived in the truth. - Really? You've destroyed it with your damn lies. Stop it, Anna. You can't tell me what to do. You don't decide for me. Go to hell! Someone sneaked into the stable. He poured gasoline over the poor creature, threw a burning match into the haystack, and ran out fast as hell. He locked the door and took the key. When they finally broke open the door, the horse charged out and ran around, ablaze. I'm coming! The damn horse wouldn't die. Anna... I want to be free. I want my solitude back. I can't go on living like this. We might have made it if we really loved each other, but we don't. Now it's easier to part... ...isn't it? More truthful. You must live in the truth, right? The way you look at it. Let us be honest for once. Why don't you answer me? Remember that time you forgot your purse, when you borrowed my phone? I found your husband's letter in it. I read it. Poor Anna. You're not lucky with men. Something must be wrong with you or your men. You always talk about living in the truth. What a deception. I remember when you talked about your happy marriage. It was a lie! A lie. It was all lies! Calm down. Will you kill me just as you... You're crazy! You're out of your mind! What's wrong with you? Say something. Why did you come for me at the fire? I came to ask your forgiveness. This time they called him Andreas Winkelman. THE END
