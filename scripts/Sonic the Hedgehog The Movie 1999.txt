See, isn't it great? It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic. Don't you wanna try it too? No thanks. All right, I'll try it myself! I guess Tails is still just a little kid. Come on, Sonic! It's okay if you can't swim! You should give it a try! Just don't get cocky and run into something. I must be hearing things. Sonic! Help me! Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails! Sonic. Are you all right, Sonic? I'm fine, but who the heck was that? Sonic, how have you been? Geez, not that old man again! I'll pass on this one. Sonic, we've gotta hurry up and do something! You're the one who can fly, why don't you just go and do something? Sonic, you idiot! Fine, I can take care of this all by myself! Mister! Mister! Tails, it's you! It's nice to see you again. I have some urgent business with Sonic. That's why I'm here. Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting so warm in here! Just hold on! I'll fix it somehow! I'm not finished yet! Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails! I got some practice in earlier on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out! What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic! Thank you, Sonic! Old man! Hey, old man! Ouch! Old man, you should stop flying those dangerous things. What are you talking about, Sonic? I know I'm a little older now, but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too. Mister, didn't you say you had some urgent business? Oh, right. It's a real emergency. It's the President. He wanted... He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away? Right, that was it! Please hurry! Old man, you could have just called to tell us that. Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place while we're gone! I understand! I don't think so. Let's go, Tails! Bon voyage! President, what's the urgent business? Right, the business. It's been a long time, Sonic, Tails. Dr. Eggman! Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show your gratitude. Don't do it! Sonic, for the sake of my daughter and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman. Eggman! You kidnaped the President and Seira so you could take over South Island, didn't you? Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded? Of course! Listen, Sonic. This concerns all of Planet Freedom, so you'd better listen to everything I have to say. No way. Don't you care what happens to pretty, young Seira? Help me, Papa! Seira! Sonic, please listen to what Eggman has to say! I guess I don't have a choice. Go ahead and talk, Eggman. Really, Sonic? As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky. We already know all that. Shut up! Shut up! And the inner dimension is known as the Land of Darkness. I live peacefully in the inner dimension, where I have created a high-tech city called Eggmanland. Recently, a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman. I don't know where he came from, but he attacked my city with a battalion of robots. They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live. Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored. He jammed the Egg Generator, causing it to run wild. According to my calculations, if the Egg Generator isn't stopped by sunrise tomorrow, there will be a giant explosion! Fine! But don't blame me when this happens! What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all of Black Eggman's traps. Then he has to get into Eggmanland and stop that generator! And it's the fastest one here that should do it! I don't wanna. You're the one that created that stupid machine in the first place. Why the hell should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island... No, the entire planet is depending on you! Sonic, I don't care what happens to Eggman or Papa, but please do this for both of us! But when Eggman speaks, 99 times out of 100 he's lying. But what if this is that one other time? Sonic! Sonic! Okay, I got it. Sonic... Tails, take this with you. What's this? It's a navigator. It will guide you to Eggmanland using the shortest route, as long as you keep it with you. Thank you, Eggman. Let's go, Tails. Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing that guy, he might've put a bomb in there. Dr. Eggman is the only one that knows how to get to Eggmanland. We don't have any other choice but to trust this thing. Well, I guess you're right. Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Seira are all right. No, no, no, I don't like it when Eggman wins every time! All right, one more time! That's enough! Give up! We've played like a hundred times! I'll stop being your hostage. Do your best! No, no, no, Eggman won again! Fine! I quit. I want to go for a drive. NO! No, no! Seira want to go for a drive! How did this get here? You rock, Eggman! I get to drive first! Don't touch that! No, wait! Don't play with that! Stop it, Seira! No, stop that! Seira! That must be the entrance to the Land of Darkness! We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic! All right, here we go! Hang on, Sonic! We're almost out of here! Tails! Tails, are you all right? I'm fine, but I'm worried about that tornado! So this is the Land of Darkness! Eggmanland should be straight ahead! All right! Let's hurry! Tails, doesn't something seem a little strange? I think that Eggman purposely picked the route with the most traps! But this really is the quickest way to the generator! There's even be a warp zone right up ahead! Let's get moving! What is this place? Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These? I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this. But Eggmanland is supposed to be really near. Let's go somewhere high and see if we can see it from there. Let's go! The ruins are sinking right into the ocean! Sonic, I bet it's because the Egg Generator is out of control and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry! I'm afraid of lightning! Tails, we just have to go straight ahead, right? That's what it says. That has to be Black Eggman! That is correct. I am Black Eggman. I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here. We don't have time to play your little games! Get out of our way! I don't think so! Hold still! Ouch! You fool, this armor is made of a super polymer alloy! Ouch! Ouch! Damn! Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here! We don't have time to mess around with this robot! Which way to Eggmanland? Let me check... That way! It's past that highway! Good! Let's go, Tails! Okay, Sonic! Black Eggman, you slowpoke! What? We know you can't keep up with our speed, so we'll just have to finish this later. No way! This is bad! I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic! Tails, grab onto me! We're safe! Don't think you're safe yet. Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below. I can't swim! Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle... I've finally gotten those two out of the way! That worked pretty well. Yeah, let's go. Geez... Crash! Crack! Boom! Damn! You damn moron! Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What the heck is this stuff? Sonic! Tails! Now, it's time for this! Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've gotten rid of Sonic so easily. I told you! It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic! Damn! Damn it! You might have the fastest feet in the world, but if you can't run, you're just a normal hedgehog. You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this! Sonic, I'll save you! Knuckles! Hurry and save Sonic! I'ts no good! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly! I've got it! Sonic, grab onto this! Who are you!? Sonic, you can do it! Damn! Ah damn! I'm out of ammo! You're one lucky bastard, aren't you? However... Not lucky enough! Thank you, Knuckles. Right back at you. It doesn't matter. You're running away? I won't forgive you, Black Eggman! Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic! Damn you, bastard Sonic! He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something even worse than Black Eggman! What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman? You're talking about yourself! You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles. Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for. Oh well, we've been friends for long enough. I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course! After all, that's what I live for! The sun's already setting! We've got to hurry! What is that thing? That's Eggmanland! Incredible! I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you. See you later! Knuckles! Hey, I'd worry about you two if I sent you in alone! See you! What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles! So this must be the entrance to Eggmanland. I never expected Eggman to live in such an awesome place! This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go! It's this way. Keep going straight ahead! Got it! I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic. Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine. Sonic, leave these guys to me and go on ahead! All right! Good luck! Tails, fly! You have to fly! Yeah, right! It's too heavy for me to move! Hang on! I'll stop this thing! Sonic! I'll have you out of there in no time! Oh no! Gotcha! Sonic, are you all right? Something's moving! It's a robot that looks exactly like Sonic! What does all this mean? What is that? It's pretty! Black Eggman's ghost! It's broken. Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to! Ow! Stop it, Seira! Please stop, Seira! Seira! Why are Seira and Eggman here together? I get it, you're Black Eggman! It wasn't Seira's fault! Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Egg Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman? I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here. Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic! What did you say? No way! This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire! I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic. Pretty good, don't you think? You might have made a robot that looks like him, but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all his data to the robot. He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom! What are you planning on doing with that thing? Isn't it obvious? I'm going to use Metal to destroy the real Sonic, and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky. What did you say? There's no way you'll get away with this! Let Seira go, Eggman! Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic! Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own! Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever! He's in trouble! Sonic! Keep going, Metal Sonic! Sonic! Wait, Tails! Sonic! Hold up, Tails! But if we don't hurry then Sonic... Calm down, Tails! There's no way that either one of us can catch up with them. We've got to think of another way! What? That's right. He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he? I'm sorry, was that uncomfortable, Seira? Come on, don't be mad. Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I wanna go home now! If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something really spectacular. Where did he go? That's it! Perfect! Perfect! That damn bastard Sonic has finally been defeated! Tails! Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado, and we're going home! Hey, hey, what about Sonic? What a nice, peaceful night. Sonic, you're back already? Sonic, what's the matter? Please stop it! Where am I? Tails... I remember leaving Eggmanland. It can't be?! That bastard Metal! Is this all part of Black Eggman's plan, too? Geez! The only one that would do something like this is Eggman! It's a lucky thing no one was staying here. That old man was watching the house for us! Old man! Old man! It doesn't look like anyone touched the inside of this place. Old man, where are you? Tails, is that you? Are you back already? Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it. Sonic came back last night. He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away. He flew away? It's Metal! Metal is really wreaking havoc here. At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan to the next stage. Here you go, Seira. This is a present for you. Yahoo! You rock! Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic! Hold on a second. This machine that Eggman gave me and Metal Sonic are built out of the same kinds of parts. I think I can use that. Really? You might be able to find Metal Sonic? But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more? Don't worry. Sonic and Metal will definitely be together. I don't get it. How come? Well, all of Sonic's data was input into Metal's memory. His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts. That's why he knew to come here. He even gave the old man his favorite clothes. I understand that, but Metal's still a robot. Even if he is a robot, Metal is operating on Sonic's thoughts and motivations. He knows everything that Sonic's ever seen or felt. The same goes for Sonic. In other words, it's just like they're twins. They're twins, huh? Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire! We've discovered the source of the disturbances. We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic! Impossible! Get Sonic's house on the line immediately. Yes, Sir. Shut up already, I'm busy! Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there? Ahhh, not that bastard! What the heck is he doing now? Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who are you? Who are YOU? I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend. I see. Is Sonic there? Is Seira safe? What happened to Black Eggman? Did you stop the generator? You sure are an annoying old man. I'm busy here! Mr. President! Look, Eggman, don't Seira look cute? Yes, it suits you very well, Seira. But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean? Once Metal has destroyed the Land of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Seira! Go to sleep, go to sleep, close your eyes... Are you crazy? Who told you I wanted to marry you anyway? I won't do it! Never! So that's what really happened. But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky. It's possible. I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet, and I've seen it. At the northernmost tip of this continent, all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier. Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier. If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion, the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force of the planet, they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible! Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this! I know that! Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails? Sonic, you're safe! It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand! Let me explain! Metal Sonic has turned northward and is moving at top speed. What did you say? Metal is planning to melt the glaciers to the north! We must stop him at any cost! Roger! Sonic. Tails, Sonic just disappeared. He must have gone after Metal. He went north! We'll have to do our best too. We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole. That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction. Here we go, Seira! No, no! I don't want to get married at the North Pole! Why me? Hold on tight, we're about to hit a warp zone. No! I told you to stop! Stop! All right! Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them. Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's personality in him! Tails, are you sure we can trust that thing? After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it. Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do! Damn it, I'm too late. Where is that bastard? He's got to be around here somewhere! What? Then this will be the real fight. We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal? What? This world isn't big enough for two Sonic's, you say? Well, the feeling's mutual. You might know everything I'm going to do, but I know everything you're going to do too! It's really a strange feeling! Sonic, you're still alive? Sonic, what's wrong with you? You pervert! Get away, you little piece of tin! I get it, you synchronized yourself with Metal. This is my chance! Seira! Sonic! Oh no, my Seira! That was close! Knuckles! Sonic! You're a perfect target for me now, damn fox! Ready, aim... Fire Eggman missiles! Gotcha! Oh no, another design failure! That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Seira? Oh man, I can't stop! You saved Seira! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please! Seira have more power than she thought she did! There you are Seira. It's time for you to come with me now. Look out! Tails! Sorry! Tails, I didn't think you'd stoop that low. Damn it! It's that bastard Metal! Sonic! Stop it, Metal! If that ice bridge is destroyed, then we're dead! Knuckles, see what you can do about the magma! Well... Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right! Here we go! You're totally cool, Mr. Mole! Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it! My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot! Sonic! What the heck do you think you're doing? Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble? Oh, that's right! I hope this works! No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then Seira have to marry Eggman! Take that! And that! And that! Hurry! Got it! Now, Sonic! Sonic! Good work, Tails! You saved us! Who is that!? It doesn't look like Eggman. That's papa's rocket! What did you say!? What? Is the door stuck? We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Seira, you wait here. Come on, let's go! Papa! Of all the pointless stunts... I know. If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble. Sonic! Get out of my way, Metal! Damn it! Sonic! I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there! Eggman! Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Impressive, Tails. But you're too late. Metal, hurry and destroy Sonic! Hurry! Hurry! I know! Shut up already! Damn! Papa! Mr. President! Old man! Sonic! Sonic, are you all right? Metal? Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic! Grab onto my hand! Don't do it, Sonic! He'll drag you under with him! There is only one Sonic... Metal! Don't do it, Sonic! Metal! Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic. It's not like you at all. She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved! Eggman! You damn fools! I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet! It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop! It's finally over. Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite. Why the heck did you do that!? So now we're finally even, Sonic. What do you mean? Wait, Knuckles! Hey, Sonic, wait up! Why the hell did you hit me!? I was getting you back for stepping on my head! I don't remember doing that! You did! I don't remember! Damn it! You're not going to get away from me, damn Sonic! I'll get your data again! What? What? What the heck are you doing, Eggman? Hurry up and catch Sonic! Of course I will! Hang on! Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again! I'm outta here! I'll see you later, Knuckles! Hey, wait up, Sonic!
