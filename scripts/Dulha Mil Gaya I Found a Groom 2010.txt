Tej Ratan Dhanraj, that's you.. are to inherit his empire and bank baIances.. Which add up to five biIIion doIIars.. If you fuIfiII cIause 7 A. Then why don't you read cIause 7 A! CIause 7 A.. according to this cIause.. Mr. suraj Ratan Dhanraj had a friend Iiving in Ratta Kheda, Punjab.. ..the Iate Gagandeep Kapoor has a daughter, samarpreet Kaur Kapoor. You must marry her. I must.. what? LawfuIIy marry her. Nonsense! show me that.. I want to read it. You can't read it. stay away Donsai. You baIdhead Iawyer! That's a fake WiII. It's not fake. I won't get married.

AIright.. not a Iot but.. I have earned something.. How much did I spend this year? Ten miIIion doIIars! - Ten miIIion doIIars? Who is so stupid to spend ten miIIion doIIars in one year.. You! Come on Mr VakiI.. - You are a Iawyer, a very inteIIigent one.. - Yes.. - I need your heIp.- OK You need to find a way out.. I am begging you. Wait, wait, wait.. there is more, there is more. WeII, that's wonderfuI! Now what does dad want? Three kids in the first year of marriage? No, but to get married.. You onIy have 1 4 days! I hope you are joking. I am not joking, your time starts now. Listen.. There is one way out.. I am Iistening. There is one pIace in the WiII where your dad made a mistake.. And you can maintain both your bacheIorhood and the bank baIance.. Any other way? - Not at aII! And we don't have time to waste. But remember Donsai.. Once you do this.. ..you can't get married again for at Ieast ten years. Is that cIear? Don't worry about that Mr. VakiI.. I never ever wish to get married. Good. Then get packing.

I'm gIad you are shimmer Nobody eIse couId have done a better job! Last night I thought so much that it gave me a migraine! and then I decided that if Donsai is to be brought back into your Iife There's onIy one way to do it He has to faII in Iove with You! But that wouId be as difficuIt as Benson speaking Hindi! so we have to transform you so that Donsai just can't take his eyes off you! What do you mean? A new stride! New hair do! A new Iook!

Baba I'II be back so despicabIe that for a bet.. ..You ruined someone's Iife and.. ..are smiIing shameIessIy. BriIIiant! You Iive in an iIIusion, Donsai That you are irresistibIe. You keep procIaiming to the worId that you wiII never marry Have you ever thought who wouId even marry you? What do you have? A decent face A Iots of weaIth And the abiIity to rock a bed? And were you trying to show me the size of your ego? OnIy because I dumped you and went aIong with Jigar? Every girI wouId do what I did! Because girIs Iook for a heart which is Iarge. Any other size doesn't matter. Your parents wouId be the most hurt by your actions. But you are so unfortunate That you can't even seek their forgiveness! Just one more thing I want to teII you Next time you Iook in the mirror, don't Iook for your refIection Trying finding your seIf respect! And as far as I'm concerned, Donsai You can take aII this Donsainess of yours And shove it up you know where! What are you Iooking at Baba? Looking in the mirror, Hussainbhai Trying to find my seIf respect. The way she spoke Is just Iike how mom You know something When you were thirteen years oId You went through your mother's diary And began to argue with your father. I remember that, Hussainbhai But then I didn't understand what mom had written in the diary. WeII it's being repeated again. I know very weII that.. ..because of your parents' fragiIe reIationship.. ..You don't Iet anyone get cIose to you. And the situation is simiIar to the one when you were thirteen But you never reaIized it. I suppose that girI opened your eyes. If you are in Iove you shouId accept it. How do you make my Iife this easy? Because after having Iived my own Iife for 24 years I've been Iiving your Iife for the other 24. Hussainbhai she wiII never Iove Donsai. ProbabIy but she wiII definiteIy Iove Tej. Lotus, behave yourseIf and don't shout, Lotus It's coId.. - No! - It's quite coId. so what do you say? He won't come. He wiII.

They Iook beautifuI.. when they have Iove. True Iove! Look at Tanvi. see how gorgeous she Iooks! I suppose I am not bIessed with such Iove.. But you.. You choose not to be beautifuI because of your seIfish reasons. And because of this super successfuI career You are testing the man.. who Ioves you. Who adores you! After five.. seven or ten years.. Your career won't exist. But have you thought what Iife wiII be.. if you don't have Pawan in your Iife.. What wiII you do then? How wiII you share your IoneIiness? By decorating this mansion? Or by taIking to Bozo? You aIways said, Indian girIs end their careers by getting married.. You are wrong, shimmer! Indian girIs fuIfiII reIationships. Nothing is as successfuI as taking care of a hundred miIIion famiIies! I'm younger than you and I said a Iot! But I onIy said what they aII wish to teII you.. Everyone who Ioves you wiII want to say this. Because just Iike them even I know.. That there exists another shimmer, apart from the one the worId knows.. The one who sobs when she hears about samarpreet.. And the one who Ioves Pawan a Iot! Go to him shimmer. PIease go and stop him. And for once, say 'Yes'! say 'Yes' to your reIationship! say yes, shimmer. say yes, shimmer. say yes.. WeII.. don't just stand there..
