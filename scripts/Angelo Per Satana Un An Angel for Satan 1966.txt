My name is Alfonzo... But everybody calls me Sergeant. Okay, Sergeant. - Goodmorning, Sergeant. - Good day. Who could that be? He sure is handsome. - Lisa! - We're coming. - Natalia! - We're coming. Are you sleeping, are you sleeping, Brother John... Who's singing? The kids from the school... come see. Morning bells are ringing, morning bells are ringing," Ding, dang, dong. - Who's that? - It's Victor, the gardener at the villa. He's a survivor. When he chops wood, he cuts himself. He's been in the asylum many times. He won't harm anybody. - Goodmorning, Sir. - Goodmorning. Thank you. Goodmorning, Sir. It's not a good time to travel, Sir. There is no good time to travel. But I'm used to it. - Good day and welcome, Sir. - Thank you, Count. I'm happy to see you. Are you feeling alright? Why? You came via the lake... and you're alright? What should've happened to me? The bad side of me always hopes for another tragedy on the lake ...to keep the legend alive and flourishing. So your good side must be very unhappy right now. Exactly. Make yourself comfortable. Please. Would you like a drink? A Cognac? Cognac? Cherry? Or a Brandy? My personal brandy will warm you up... - There's nothing like it. - Yes, Brandy. Thank you. - I think we'll get along fine. - So do I. - To your arrival. - To your health. - A cigar? - No. I don't smoke. Have a seat. You know, because of the extraordinary heat last summer ...the water level of the lake has declined amazingly. Although this is truly a disaster... Something amazing has come from it. You're talking about the discovery of the statue, Count. Yes, the statue. You wouldn't know about this because you are a foreigner... If the statue is retrieved ... it means damnation for sure. As the story goes, restoration of the statue ...will cause tragedy to the entire village Do you still wish to work here? My dear Count, I know you've studied the legend, and you enjoy a good story... but I don't believe in curses. I only wish you had told me about it when you hired me... Would you have accepted? But, of course. Without the legend... There's no reason for me to reconstruct the sculpture. But now everything is out in the open... If it weren't for my grandson, Pupi Lauria... the statue would still beat the bottom of the lake... And you wouldn't be here. I appreciate the story very much ... but I don't believe in curses. - When can I start working? - Tomorrow if you'd like... If you need anything, just ask. Julian is at your service... - Do you need anything in particular? - No, thank you. I'll have a bottle of my brandy sent to your chambers... A glass before you go to bed... and you'll sleep heavenly. Come in. Count, something terrible has happened. What's wrong, Julian? The 2 boatmen who accompanied Mr Merigi...! Something horrible, sir Count... They came ashore to have a drink. Then they went back to the boat ...they were crossing the lake, and after a couple minutes... for no reason... The boat flipped and sank... They were good swimmers, but they couldn't... They started screaming for help. Carlos. Victor. The teacher... They all jumped into the water. But... too late!... - They watched them drown! - Dead! They were the 2 fishermen who removed the statue from the lake. My dear, you can't expect her to stay in school all her life. She's the owner. It's only logical that she comes home. But Harriet can't do anything without you... She's too young, too naive... She would get robbed blind. You can't let that happen. - What's wrong? - Mr Merigi... And? Aren't we free? You're a widow. I'm divorced... What's the problem? I don't like gossip... When Harriet arrives, I don't want her to know about us. What's wrong, Ilda? Your nerves are a wreck. Is Harriet beautiful? Yes. Very. Beautiful and rich... she can do whatever she wants. She loves me, I've been like her father for a long time. Who knows what would've happened to her without me. And without me, what would become of you? You decide... either throw those pictures in the fire or get out of here. Can I ask why? Don't argue and don't ask questions... Just decide. Alright. I've decided... I'm staying here. And I'll continue to draw. I expected that! A gentleman... living at the Castle! We've had enough bad luck... because of that statue... Two of our God-fearing citizens have lost their lives over it. And now you're drawing our faces on paper... it's bad luck, it will cause even more tragedy! Do you need any help? Does it show that I might need help? I guess you got hit... Who did it? A very big no-neck man. Really? I know him. He's a nice fella. Some other aggressive men, too. They're not really aggressive. Carlos has a wife and 5 children. What do they have against me? Try to understand. Two fishermen are dead. - Do you believe in the curse? - No... But these are ignorant people. Superstitious... They are nervous over the statue found in the water that you'll restore... They blame it for everything. Do you know the legend? No, I don't know it. I'm new here. The villagers are very backward... they don't trust outsiders. I only get along with my students. - I'm Roberto Merigi. - I'm Dario Morelli. Good evening, Rita. - See you later. - Goodbye. Excuse me. Finally, dear. - You were here waiting for me to arrive? - Yes. Come, Dario. If you knew how much I loved you... No one will ever come between us, my love. The Count left a message for you, Sir. He's in the city to pick up his niece, Harriet. The young lady arrives at noon ... from England. - Excuse me. - Yes, Sir? - You're from these parts? - Yes, Sir... My family has always been connected with Montebruno ...for at least two centuries. Then you must know the legend of the statue... I've been taught not to worry about things like that. The Count knows everything about this subject. Certainly. Here you are dear... at home. - Welcome, Countess. - Thank you. As you can see... Victor has maintained the grounds. I knew you liked the hedges, so we kept them the same. I hope you approve... come. Harriet Montebruno... the mistress of the house. She will give the orders from now on. Guglielmo... the butler. Vittorio... the gardener. Rosa... the cook. This is Rita... your personal maid. And Sergeant... an old soldier ...in charge of security. Here's Ilda... the governess. She's probably familiar to you. You were five years old when you left Italy... You were a beautiful little girl, but now, you're even prettier. Thank you, Ilda... I'm sure we'll get along... Come, Rita. Mister, what are you doing? I'm working, little lady. My name is Barbara. What's yours? Roberto. Can you tell me why you're here, little one? The boats. Sergeant knows I come here. But it's alright. Sergeant is a good man... Are you sure you're not a troublemaker? - You are. - Me? Yes. My father says... By fixing the statue you make it stink. Stink? The statue? I don't think so... When my father says something stinks... he means 'problems. ' What kind of problems? I don't know... but something to do with the curse. And you're not scared? No. Here... everybody is scared. But I like it. Curses are fun.. You're a good little girl, Barbara. Who's your dad? Carlo Lionesi. He's the strongest man in the village. Do you know him? Yes, I know him. I really know him. - Well, now I'm going. - Hope to see you soon, Barbara... When you pass by again, stop and see me. Okay. And if any curses come you can tell me. Alright, Barbara. Merigi, I knew you'd be left speechless... Harriet Montebruno... Roberto Merigi, sculptor... Please. Identical, right Merigi? Harriet and the nymph, Two drops of water. - Incredible. Naturally, there's an explanation. You see... an ancestor of Harriet, Maddalena Montebruno, wanted her body and soul preserved in marble. So she hired a sculptor for the job... Harriet, obviously, inherited the same beauty as her ancestor. Maddalena has a distant cousin named Belinda who lived here... Please. It's a tragic story... don't ruin my first dinner at home... - As you wish, my dear. - In front of this young beauty, I confess... I've lost all interest in the legend. Very well, thank you. Let me rather ask you, Miss Harriet, given your likeness with the nymph, to accept serving as a model for me. The face of the statue is damaged. Do not worry, it won't take long. Is it... necessary? No, not necessary, but... it would be very useful for a perfect work. - So, I accept. - Wonderful! Like two centuries ago! Lady of the manor, sculptor and statue! Are you afraid of the lightning? Yes - since I was a little girl. That's stupid, isn't it? We must stop, the light is no more sufficient. You think so? We can't go home in this weather! The weather seems conducive for conversation. Let's see if I can answer the questions you plan to ask?... I'm an orphan. I was educated in London for 15 years... Now, finally, I can collect the inheritance left by my parents. - Is that enough for you? - For the moment, yes. But there's something else I need to know. - Ask me. At dinner you refused to hear the legend of the statue. Why did you hire me to restore it? What do you mean? I wasn't the one who hired you... - It was the Count's idea. - Oh, so that's it... Well, I also restore paintings, statues, mosaics, but I prefer sculptures. I'm a loner. I mean, I'm not married... Until now, I haven't met a good companion. Now that we all know each other... Let's call each other Harriet and Roberto. Don't you think it's too soon, Mr Merigi? No. I don't think so. It's not too soon. Thirsty... this liquor... Roberto! Come in... don't be afraid... Come... Come closer... I'm here. It's me... Belinda. I... Belinda. I'm Belinda. Look at me... hideous... When my beautiful cousin, Maddalena, was most desirable... I hated her! When the young sculptor carved the marble... I was filled with rage and jealousy... I hated that symbol of beauty. I died with a hunger for love. I wanted to be caressed, kissed, possessed. But I was pushed away... they laughed at me. The men all wanted her... Her... the statue! They displayed it by the lake. The beauty... Her beauty triumphed. And I? I was hateful. Envious... Filled with anguish. Then one night, I entered the sculptor's bedroom. I wanted him to love me... caress me... just once... Just once... Instead... He was with Maddalena. I wanted to kill them. But I didn't have the strength. I left, I was running in the park desperately... Suddenly!... the damned statue! I wanted to destroy it! Damn you! We died together, me, and the image of beauty... Now, Madelina is alive again with the face of Harriet. You can't love her! She is cursed, too! Her perfidy is hidden under her beauty. And if you love her... The curse... will fall on you too. Remember that! All will perish... Disaster and death will reign until she disappears. How do you feel? Better? Yes. Yes. I think so... I had been very ill. What happened to me? You fainted, don't you remember? No. I'm not sure... This liquor... Don't worry... wait until you're feeling better. There's only one thing that will cure me. What's that? Take my hand again, I beg you. What are you saying? - Your medicine, Sir. - What is it? A Cordial. Drink it. You'll feel better. I'd like to know what happened to me. It seems you picked up a virus, Sir. It will pass soon. - I'm scared. - Of what? I don't know... - but I'm scared. - Don't worry, Harriet. Nothing will happen to you... As long as I'm near. Yes. Yes, I know. Don't leave me, never. Ever. It's so beautiful to be alive. Beautiful!... Don't you think so? Do you have a boyfriend? Tell me... I'll be happy if you do. Yes, ma'am. - Do I know him? - I don't think so, ma'am. Come on, tell me. Who is it? He's the teacher at the school. He's alone. He's been here for a short time. The Count permits him to take his students to our garden, and well, that's how we met. - And does he love you? - Yes, but... He's very timid, ma'am. I think I'm the first woman in his life. Thank you. Good night, Rita. Good night, madam. Are you tired? Come to bed. Here he is! Our Michelangelo in action. I don't try to be pretentious, Harriet. Don't make such a face... and don't call me Harriet... My name is Belinda. Don't you like Belinda? What are you saying, Harriet?... Why that name? - Don't touch me! - Harriet! - Let me go! - Are you crazy? What's wrong? Didn't you know? I adore violence... Hard! Squeeze me! Squeeze me! Hard!... That's enough! No one can have Belinda... Belinda is aloof... She's above everybody... Only the lake could've taken her. I want feel the heat of your fire, Vittorio. Take off my boots Have you ever seen a naked woman? Have you? Don't look at me! Bow your head. I told you not to look... or you'll regret it... Now, would you like to see me. Answer! A kiss is like the heat of a fire. Isn't it, Vittorio? I warned you! Beast! Children! Quiet! If one of you makes a mistake ... that's not a reason to laugh. Umberto... It's true that a horse has a tail... But it's connected to the posterior... Clear? That's how you say it... Posterior. My father calls it 'ass. ' Finally, a happy school. Good day, ma'am. Everyone, stand. Your name is Dario, right? I'd like to speak with you please. Certainly. Barbara, make sure everyone behaves themselves. It's a pleasure to meet you... I am Harriet Montebruno. I know, ma'am. You're very young to be a teacher... Someone has talked to me about you. Me? You're in love with Rita? - Well, ma'am... I... - She also loves you... Excuse me if I am prying. I just want to give advice... You should try... how should I say this? You should be less timid with her... Understand? Rita's been with me for a short time, but I understand her. I want her to be happy. You two should meet more often. I'd love to, but... The villa was made for lovers like you... Meet her tonight. And excuse my interference... But you're both so young... - You'll do it? - Certainly, ma'am. And thank you. Goodmorning. You're very strong. Certainly, I'm strong. I don't think you like me very much. It's not because of you... It's the statue. It should have stayed at the bottom of the lake. We're afraid it will cause tragedy. A man like you believes this superstition?... That wheel must be heavy. It's very heavy, but I could throw it 30 feet. I think you're exaggerating, Carlo. - You'll see. Ask me to do something that really takes strength. You're much stronger than our sculptor. How delightful! Are they yours? Five of them, including Barbara. She's at school... She's quite a girl! - I twist an ankle. - Damn... Come to my house. Agnese will prepare something... Are you hurt? No, thanks, but I must return home. But I can't ride the horse any more. - Could you carry me? - Certainly, ma'am. Certainly. Alberto, keep an eye on the horse. You are so strong! Please, come see me tomorrow... I must talk to you. Guglielmo, go upstairs for Mr Merigi. Please, he has had his reasons! Tell him that his absence at the table is forgiven, but that we would like to see him here. - Yes, Sir. You have eaten almost nothing. You have a face so... autumnal. But I'm feeling very well! And I have no reason to... I'm sure of that. It's strange that the appetite is also missing upstairs. Excuse me, Harriet. It's not just casual curiosity... - Is there something going on between... - What do you mean, Uncle? No dear... I mean, some kind of argument, or something... - No... - Fine, we won't talk about it. Very soon you'll be receiving your inheritance... You'll have documents and bills, simply a lot to think about. Please Uncle. This isn't the time... Let me relax for a couple of days. Aren't you my manager? Yes, my dear. Well, let's do as you wish. Count, I checked the shop... but Roberto isn't there. - Mr. Merigi. - Hello. I saw the light in the window and... - Why don't you come in? - No. No thanks. I've been working and I'm tired. I just wanted to say hello. Very kind of you. You are a brave man, Sergeant. Good night. By the way, there's something I wanted to ask you. Perhaps you could do a favor for me. Whatever I can do, Sir. When I got here... I left a leather bag on the boat... There were important instruments inside. But the boat sank. Yes... Is it possible to hire some fishermen? Some men who would be willing to salvage the vessel?... - Naturally at my expense. - Well, I don't see why not. - I'll take care of it. - Thank you, Sergeant. Good night. I don't want anyone at the villa to know about this. The fact that I consulted elsewhere would cause sorrow to them. - Don't worry about it. - Thank you. Good night. Check to the King! Want some advice, Harriet? Go to bed... When playing chess, you must pay attention... You can't daydream and expect to play. I didn't know you get grouchy. - Good night. - No, wait... Wait a minute... Where have you been? I was working, Sir. In fact, I expect to finish very soon, goodnight. And now come here and excuse yourself to the lady. Come on. Good evening, ma'am. Please, forgive me for my absence from the dinner. No. You don't have to be so melodramatic. I have a headache, chess is stressful... Good night. You know very well why I didn't come for dinner. So, there's a reason... It's better that way. Well, I almost quit the job... I was going to leave. But one thing is for sure... I won't be your toy. What are you saying? I treated you like a toy? Why don't you stop twisting the knife? - You're crazy! You're completely crazy. You have no right to treat me this way! Harriet... Look at me! This morning you came to me... you acted differently... You were another person. This morning? I... For the love of God, Harriet! What's happening? Nothing, Roberto. I was so happy... so content. And now you... Roberto... Go to sleep. Go. Rita. Rita. Dear! You! Yes, me. Kiss me. Kiss me. When someone is strong and courageous... He's not afraid of the statue or the lake. But yesterday you said the opposite... You've become just like the rich bastards. I'm not like anybody else. You shaved your beard, you're wearing good clothes... Who are you trying to impress? I'm not trying to impress anybody... Someday you'll be sorry you said those things. Laugh. Laugh. You idiots!... At night you close up your homes because you're afraid of witches... And the witches are in your houses... They're your wives! - You're full of shit! - Get lost! I'll show you! I'll cool you off! Come on! Refresh yourself, you vermin! I'll relieve you of the heat that suffocates you. You dog! Don't pull my hair! Tell me, Rita. Do you like being kissed? Come on. Answer. You like it. Right?... You're very pretty, hasn't he told you that?... Hasn't he? Men are evil. Don't you know?... They have fun making us suffer. Even yours! You don't have to be romantic like Harriet... I've known that for over 200 years. Men are evil ... and Belinda knows. You're too beautiful for them, Rita. Who is this? Guglielmo, madam. One moment... ...my robe. Come in. Ma'am, Carlo is here. He said you called for him. Yes, Guglielmo. I must give him some work... You can go, Rita. - Goodmorning, ma'am. - Goodmorning. What perfume! It makes my head spin. You like it?... - You scare me. - I scare you? No... Too bad you already have a wife and children. I'm going crazy, ma'am. Crazy. I'm so sorry. There's other person who says that... A person I don't like... a disagreeable man. Who is this? Oh, he's just a boy... But he has bad manners. Rude... I think his name is Dario. Yes... that's it. Dario. The teacher! If you'd like I'll take care of him. No. That's alright, Carlo... I will do it myself. I'd like to find happiness... I don't know... someone who really loved me... But instead, everything seems so rotten... This marsh you call a lake. This house. Piteous villagers... I regret coming back to this house. You could help me... Only you. Hold me. Promise me you'll never leave me... Do you love me? Tell me. Tell me. Yes. Rita. Yes. Why am I so unhappy? Why? Rita... What's wrong? - Well, Louise. Are you ready? - Now I'm ready, come on. Who knows why Natalia didn't come today. - She probably stayed home... - Perhaps to help her mother. Look! Louisa! Oh my God! Natalia! I brought flowers. But I can't console your pain. We don't know how to interpret your concern. You're the family who caused the bad luck with that statue. You have brought enough misfortune. - Get out of my sight! - Why? Tell me! What does this mean? Damn witch! You have put a curse on us! Go away, damn witch! You brought a curse here! Go away, it's your fault! Return the statue to the lake! You cursed us! Go away! Damn witch! Let's go, Rita. I'll need more details... this isn't complete. Really? - I'll rewrite it. - No, I'll take care of it. Okay. - Has Harriet returned? - No. Not yet. I go to meet her. You go on home. I must go back. I must go back! But, madam! Don't argue! Do what I said! - Rita?! - Count, the madam... I saw. Where is she going? I don't know, Sir. She said she was going back. Strange, very strange. Go. I knew you were following me... You... you killed Natalia! You stripped her to see her naked! Then you raped her... And you killed her because her nakedness drove you wild! Don't be afraid! No one suspects you... I won't say anything. But you're still not satisfied, are you? You have your eyes on Lisa and Maria. Tell the truth! I'm right... You want them! And then you can have me too! Yes... Even me! Go now! Don't tell anyone about this conversation. Damn leech! Someday I'll kill you and your children! What did I do? Certainly for a man like you... this life must be a nightmare. I'll kill them. I'll kill them all. Everyone has their own problems, my friend. I was just going to the school to tell the teacher to stop harassing me. What else can I do? In fact, I'm just a fragile woman. At your service, Sir. I will leave the room, but you will wait for my return. It will only take a minute... just play along with me. When I raise my voice... don't be alarmed... Yes, Sir, even if I don't understand... It's just a joke, Guglielmo. Or if you prefer, it's a surprise. Yes, Sir. Can you hear me... Guglielmo? I'm coming down. Don't move. So Guglielmo...? Yes, Mr Merigi. I heard your voice. Not distinctly. But clear. It seemed like it was coming from the cabinet... I hope you will explain it to me. I'm afraid you wouldn't understand, Guglielmo... Or maybe, you'd understand too well. Did I disturb you? Have a seat... Are you correcting homework? I wish this notebook were mine... Have you seen Rita? Yes, ma'am. And you told her? No. I didn't tell her. I didn't want to upset her. Rita sends a kiss. Do you want it? No... Let me go! Don't touch me! - You scoundrel! - I don't understand! Bastard! Leave me alone! Let go, I tell you! Let go of her! Stop it. I didn't tell you to kill him. I feel tired. What's wrong with me? I'm exhausted. - You came in so late. - Really? Weren't we together? Yes, ma'am... but then you... Are you alright? What's wrong? What do you think is wrong? Stupid! Come here. Quickly! Do you like me, Rita? Look. Look at me... We're much prettier than men... don't you think?... I'm sure you are beautiful, too. No... No, madam. Wait... I want to give this to you... If you do what I say, it's yours. You could live in luxury like me, we'd have so much fun... making men suffer... eh?... It's him... right? It's for you? Yes, I think so. Go ahead... but tell him you don't love him any more. Tell him everything is finished between you two. Understand? Look at me Rita. Tell him! Understand? - Yes... - Swear it! Swear you'll tell him just like that!... Otherwise, I'll accuse you of being a thief. Or worse!... You'll regret it always! Swear you'll tell him! Swear! I swear. Go... quickly. - Rita... - What's happened? I'm so upset, Rita. Everything was so beautiful before, and now... I don't understand anything. Help me dear. Please. Help me. Dario, why are you crying? Rita, let's go away from here. To another country... I'm scared. I'm starting to believe the curse is real... I'm so confused. I love you so much, darling. Let's go away. We could get married. I can't kiss you any more, Dario. - I don't have the desire. - But Rita... What are you saying? I believe and I think I don't love you any more. We won't see each other ... ever. Rita! Why are you saying this? Why? Find another girl better than me. Forgive me Dario, but I don't love you any more. I don't know how this happened... I just don't love you. It was her, right? She's forcing you to say this!... I love you Rita! I can't live without you! Please!... If you leave me... my life is over! Harriet! Roberto. - I feel like I'm suffocating. - What's wrong? - Help me. - Should I get someone? - What is it? - I can't breathe! - Roberto, help me. - I don't know what to do... I'm suffocating... Bastard! I can't believe you! Uncle, it's terrible! He tried to rape me! Harriet! What are you saying? Yes! He tried to rip off my clothes. You've abused our hospitality, Mr Merigi. No, Sir! I'm an innocent victim of your niece's strange behavior. I don't think this climate is conducive for the young lady. Good night. He lies The statue is finished but he won't leave. He has no intention of leaving. Do you know why? Do you? Because he wants me! He wants me!... That's the truth. Good evening. I think it was a mistake to fish her out. The people here hate her. But she's very beautiful. Do you know they call me a witch?... Roberto... Wait. Please. Talk... What did I do? Help... help! Help! It was him! Him who killed Natalia! And now... Mr Merigi, I was looking for you. - What? - They salvaged the boat. - Where? - Down by the dock. Let's take a look. Hey. Look at this. There's a hole... some gunpowder. Those poor men weren't killed by magic... here's the proof. They were assassinated. There's a fire... And a big one. - How did it happen? - It was Carlo! He's gone crazy! He wanted to be free from all of them! Water! Bring water! Hurry! Where are the children? Mercy! They're inside! - The wife's in there, too. - God, why did he do it? The damn witch caused all this! It was her fault! Barbara. It wasn't father. It wasn't father. The curse... It's the curse. I'm alone now! I'm alone! She's told me... And now it's true!... The mistress! She got inside here! Here!... You understand, do you? I'll tell your mom... ... and the others. Don't move. Wait for me. - It was her! - It was her fault! Death! Death! We should hang the witch! - To the Castle! - Yeah, quickly! Listen... Listen to me! You were with her, too! Let him talk! He risked his life for the little girl! Listen to me. At the villa, I've seen strange things... This isn't about witches or curses... This is about criminals and assassins. On that little girl's death... I swear to give you justice... Whatever that may be! Look at me Harriet. Why do you resist? Look at me! Now I order you... and you will do it because... Your mind must obey my wish. You'll do it? Answer! Yes. Get up. Now you will go to Carlo's house. People will threaten you. But you won't be afraid... you will despise them. You won't be afraid even when they attack... And they try to kill you. That's your plan! Bastard! You want this young girl to die at the hands of the vigilantes! What are you saying? Are you crazy? I heard everything, you snake! I swore on a little girl's death that I would bring justice to the area... and I'll do it! If you want to listen, I'll explain everything... ... about Harriet. She's crazy. It's her fault. The statue... What are you saying? The statue served your dirty interests. You want to be the owner of everything! That's your plan! You murdered the 2 fishermen... with tricks and deceit... The drugs in the alcohol, The whispering voices talking about the legend of the lake. And in the end, you used a hypnotic power over this girl. Bastard! I should give you to the hands of justice, but you and your wealth control the police. I'll let the villagers take care of you! Let's go! Please... Listen to me. It wasn't me. It wasn't me who caused this to happen... I was forced by something stronger, stronger than both of us! I was blinded by her passion and her greed. It was her! She wanted to use the statue to scare the village. She called the curse on Harriet, on this house, on me! The blood of Belinda!... Her hate! Her revenge! It was her fault! It was her! It was me! Yes, it was me!... Me who have led Dario to death, I killed Natalia! I wanted to destroy all love!... So I killed Vittorio, Carlo, the little girl... weak people, slaves to sentiment! Yes! I have the blood of Belinda. But I'm not a victim like her! I'm a winner! I conquered love ... by using the force of hate! Nobody can stop me! Roberto... You're safe. Damn you!
