Hey, that was pretty sick. How come I've never seen you around? I'm around, I just don't like the park too much. Just don't film me anymore, okay? You don't want a video? Nope. Dude, if you had a video, people could check out your mad skills. I could hook you up. The number one skate video on YouTube, mine. Wow. That's awesome. Hey, think about it. Hosoi, hey. man, what'; up? So, you know that kid? Nah, I just, I just met him. That kid is really good. Yeah, he rips it up. Yeah. Alright, man, take it easy. See you around, man. What's up, Zach? What's gain' on, man? How you doing? Good. Check it out, your friend's back. Oh. Hey, you want to have some fun? Let's do it. Yeah, little bro. What's for lunch, old man? Food is a blessing. Whatever. Ha-ha-ha! Nice. I forgive you. Save it. Later. We all need forgiveness. Thank you. I'm Ralf. Mom? Food in the oven. Love, Mom. Yes, yes, this is Bethany Jones. Well, well, okay, yes. Can you just tell me over the phone? Thank you. God. Jasmine? Yes. Delivery for Jack Sanders. Thank you. Where's Stupack? Stupack? He's not here. What do you mean he's not here? He had a family emergency. Why wasn't I told? He said he'd be back shortly. Who exactly is it that signs your check? You, sir. Yeah, that'd be me. How long ago did he leave? Maybe two hours ago. Get him on the phone. Tell him I need him in my office in thirty minutes or... Just, just my office, thirty minutes. Mr. Stupack, Mr. Sanders needs you back in the office immediately. What? Oh, Bill. So happy you could join us. Come on in. Shut the door. I'm really sorry about that. My wife had an accident on the floor-- Tell me, what, what is this? That is the Childer's building. Uh, I pulled all the permits last week. You did? Uh-huh. So, tell me what does, what does that read? Uh, quarter inch. Yeah, and how about that? What does that read? Half inch. You proofed these plans? Yes, I don't know how this-- I'm not interested in how this happened. What I'm interested in is happy clients. I will get on it right away. Yes, you will. Now, the city expects corrected plans no later then nine o'clock. Tomorrow morning, Jack, that's-- That's what, Bill? That's what? Unreasonable? Impossible? Which one is it, Bill? It's neither. I'm sorry, I will get on it right away. Bill! You might want to take these with you. Caleb. Caleb! Caleb! Caleb! Caleb! What? Do you think you could hear it? I'm surprised the neighbors haven't complained. What? Just wanted to talk to you for a minute. Well, I'm busy. You're too busy for your own momma? Please tell me you didn't eat a whole bag of chips for dinner. Okay, I won't. Did you hear back from any of those art schools yet? Nope. What's that? Can I see? No, it's nothing. Come on, let me see. Mom, stop. Oh, why? You used to always let me see. What is with you, huh? It's not, it's not finished. I'm not going to show you if it's not finished. You're so talented just like your... $top Oh, honey, I know you, you love to skate. I know. I just wish you would invest your time into something that could offer you a future, you know? Something more respectful. Respectful? You gotta be kidding me. What does that mean? Mom, skating is my future, okay? It's what's gonna take me away from this place, and when I go, I'm not, I'm not coming back, Mom. Is that what you think? No, no, that's what I know. I hate this place, okay? It sucks. What's with the attitude, huh? I'm just trying to talk to you. Now you wanna talk? Mom, you're never home. I'm never home because I'm out working two jobs to try to pay the rent for this stupid place that I barely can afford and put food on the table. I mean, where do you think this skateboard came from, huh? You can go out and get a job. Why don't you try getting a job? Help out. Whatever. Whatever. Whatever, okay. Look, I am doing the best I can. Yeah, well-- Yeah, well, what, huh? You think l wanted to lose the house? Is that what you think? The bills were filling up. It's not my fault! Your, your booze bill, Mom? Is that what was pilling up? What did you say? You don't think I notice? What? You're probably why I don't have a father. What? What? Hey, not fair, uh-uh. Look, I know things have been really hard lately and it's been hard for you to make friends, but you will make friends, you will, and things will get better, I promise you. You and I are all we have. So, can't we just... Please, just let's just cut each other a little slack. Can we just do that? Because it's really hard to be your mother and your father. Well, maybe you should stop trying. Oh, that's... Something. What's happening to us? You got cash, man? Please, God, take care of him. Hey. honey Home and it's still light out. What's the occasion? I wanted to make dinner for my sarcastic yet wonderful son. I hope you're hungry, 'cause I'm going all out here. Can you set the table? 'Where.-'re you going? To watch T.V. Honey, I really wanna talk to you. We haven't talked in a long time, and I have some stuff to discuss with you. Could you set the table? You know, I've, I've been having these headaches lately, and I had some tests ta ken and... Anyway, I, I wanted to talk to you about your father. I know you're really confused about him, and then I think it's time-- Confused? What? Confused? How, how am I confused, Mom? I've never had a father. How is that confusing? I just think that you should know that... Well, your father and I, he was-- I know what happened. You met a guy when you were on vacation and nine months later you ended up with me. I didn't end up with you. I had a choice and I chose you. I was a mistake. You were not a mistake. Don't ever say that. You were not a mistake. I don't wanna have this conversation, okay? It's stupid. Well, wait, Caleb! Caleb, I found pot in your room. What are you doing going through my stuff? What are you doing with pot? Who cares? Where did you get it? Mom, why does it matter? Look, I have a pot dealer, okay? It helps me get away from like this little perfect world that we live in, and you do the same thing with your stupid pills. My pills are for my headaches. They're prescribed medication. Pot is illegal. Caleb, don't walk away from me. I'm your mother. Then why don't you start acting like it? What is this? Who are you? I don't even know who you are anymore. Well, the feeling's mutual. Do you remember we used to do stuff together, Mom? Do you remember that? Do you think I not know about the liquor you hide in the cabinets? Ever since you've started to drink, you've never been the same. You are such a hypocrite. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I hate you. Honey? Caleb! Open this door right now! Open this door right now! I need to tell you something. Open it! Caleb, open this door! Open Up! Open this door! Honey. Oh. Mom? Mom? Hey. hey. wake up. Mom! Oh my God, what's wrong? Mom. How long is she, uh... A coma can last a day or much, much longer, but she can hear you. Well, Denise, you look beautiful as usual. Thank you, Mr. Sanders. Pilot here yet? Yes, he's out preflighting the plane. Great. There's fresh coffee. Why don't you go out and check. Make sure the Wi-Fi's working. Yes, sir. So, Santa Barbara? Yes, Santa Barbara. Business or pleasure? What do you think? That's too bad. Are we ever gonna have that dinner you promised me? Ah, sorry, this new building's got me working around the clock. Well, all work and no play-- Makes Jack a very, very wealthy boy. I'll tell you what, Denise, um, Saturday night, eight o'clock, you busy? :3:. Great, I will see you there. Okay- Wait, where? I don't know. Pick it. Text me. No. Make it work. Yeah,I know that's what you do, so do it. Bye. Good morning. Hello, Stu pack. The usual, Mr. Sanders? Yes, Tennille, please. And for you, Mr. Stupack? Uh, just an ice tea. Okay, I'll be right back. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so we decided to put the staircase here on the engineer's recommendation. Engineer's recommendation? Oh, he wouldn't sign off on the project unless we put it there. It's no good. You set up a meeting with that engineer. I already tried. He's booked. The staircase goes where I say it goes. That's it, end of story. Okay, I'll get on it. Good. Architecture used to be about beauty, functionality. If it's not beautiful, then why are we doing it? I used to be an artist. I don't go running around telling people, but I had not a dime to my name. I was always paint splattered, and I was really... And one day I was walking downtown, and I realized what good, really, is a painting if there's no wall to hang it on? How's our usual coming, Tennille? It's coming, sir. Just one ice cub. I hear a rumor it turns to water. Yes, sir, I know. Captain and Tennille. Thank you. Anything else for you, sir? No, that's it. Just get us to Santa Barbara. You got it. Thank you. Mr. Jones. Sorry to wake you, Mr. Jones. Caleb. Call me Caleb. Caleb, I think it'd be a good idea if you went home and got some rest. How much longer until she's better? Too soon to tell right now. She could be in this state for a little while. I promise I'll let you know if there's any change. Right now she needs to get some rest and so do you. I know I'm not family, but if you need anything, call me. Don't get into trouble. Oh! Dude, you're late! Hey, I was editing your last video. Oh, I was ripping, right? You know it. There you go. Jerry, get us a few beers, man. You got it, bro. Hey, hey, I told you to stop with the "bro" stuff, alright? I'm sorry, man. Yeah, don't let that happen again. You got it. Yeah, hey, can I have one? I don't think so. Okay, I'll just, um, kick it right here then. Joey, here you go, man. Nah, I'm good. I'm just gonna... It's cool. No, you're gonna open that and you're gonna drink it. Okay- Oh, man. Alright, down to business, huh? Wow. Very funny. Who, who we got? Seriously, who we got? Any prospects? What's going on? This new guy named Caleb. What's up, man? Yo. Box is too full. Wouldn't fit. Than ks. Ouch. Excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Sandco. You mean Mr. Sanders? Yeah, whatever. Name? Caleb. Okay, um- I'm sorry, but unless you have an appointment with Mr. Sanders, I can't-- He's a very busy man. Will you just tell him I'm here? Yeah, I'm sorry, sir. I have a Caleb here to see you. Oh, no, no, no. Um, he's just a... I'm his son. Tell him. Sir, he, um, says. He says he's your son. Yes, sir. Sorry, he's about to step into a really important meeting, so, um, he asked that I get your telephone number. My phone number? Are you serious? Sir, I'm so sorry. Hold all my calls. Listen, I'm really busy here. So, what I think we should do is I think we should plan a time where we can really sit and talk. I'll take you to dinner. You name the place. My treat. Wow, that is awfully nice of you. Why don't you go ahead and just take your meeting, 'cause I don't know what I'm doing here anyway. Wait. No, see I spent eighteen years waiting, Jack. Eighteen. It's no wonder she never told me about you. Then how did you find me? By accident. She knows you're here? The last time I checked she was in a coma. What happened? Do you care? Do I care? Yes, of course, I care. I care. Cancer. Uh. Listen, I'm, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry. Uh, if there's anything I can do. If you need me to-- A little late for help. Just a little late for that. Listen, son, your mother-- Do not call me son, okay? Never call me that! Please keep your voice down, alright? This is nothing... I'm sorry. I-- Left. You left. You see, I'm what society refers to as a bastard. You know what that makes you? Uh-huh, never mind. Here. You can keep these. She worked two jobs so she never had to cash those, and there is no way that I'm gonna cash 'em now. I know she never cashed the checks. She never cashed a check, but I kept writing the checks. I wrote those checks. Nice move, Jack. Why. huh? Why? To make you feel better about yourself? No. Forget it. Forget me. Forget her. Caleb. Stay here, we need to talk this through. I've got more important things to do. Dear Beth, I don't know how to say what I wanna say, except to just say it. You know how much I love you, and someday even want to marry you, but I'm just not ready to be a father right now. I was offered an internship at a great architectural firm in Boston, and it's a great opportunity for me. I know you'll make the right choice. You always do. Love, Jack." Nice combo, bro. Oh, Ryder, what's up, buddy? What's up, Tim. Good to see you, man. You should come skate the bowl with us. Yeah, let's do it. Actually, you know what? I'll meet you over there. Right on. See you then. Joey, is that the guy? Yeah. Yeah, that's him. Go follow him. Alright. Hey. Caleb. Caleb, wait up, man. Hey, man, wait up. Wait up. What are you, stalking me? No, I'm sorry, I just, I really need to talk to you about something. It's important. It better be good. Do you wanna make a lot of cash? Yeah, that usually involves something illegal. No, dude, Skate Down. Skate Down. Lame. If you win it, sponsors will hear about it. I'll get sponsored. You really need to do this. You have no idea what I need to do. You're just a geek who runs around with that stupid camera that your daddy probably bought you, filming skaters that you wish you could be. Get lost. Hi. Hi. I'm, I'm so sorry. The meeting ran very, very long. You look beautiful. Thank you. Don't worry. I ordered us a bottle of wine. Terrific. I hope you like it. I'm sure I will, and I could use a little bit of that right now. Here's to a wonderful evening. A wonderful evening. I'm glad we finally got to do this. Yes. Yes? Bill, you need to stay there and get it done tonight. I understand that, yes. Kobayashi doesn't need it 'til Wednesday, but I want Kobayashi to be happy. When Kobayashi is happy, then I am happy. When I'm happy, you still have a job. Yes. Bill, I'm at dinner, and I really don't wanna come over there and hold your hand. I'm sorry. Alright. I'm on my way. I am so sorry. I, I, uh, it's... It's fine. It's complicated. Listen, I promise I'll make it up to you. Okay- Okay? Mm-hm. I'll take care of the wine. No, no, I'll-- It's fine, really. She's still in serious condition. She's fading in and out, okay? So, be patient. You can only see her for a few minutes. Caleb, light conversation only. Okay- Mom? Mom, can you hear me? Hi, honey How are you? I'm good. I'm... How are you? Did you hear from any of those art schools yet? Not yet. Make sure that you tell me when you do, okay? I will. I met him. What's that, honey? I said I love you, Mom. I love you, too. So much. So much. Yo, what's up, man? What's up, buddy? Are we all set? You know it. Who we got? Just a bunch of kooks from somewhere else. Man, we got this. What about the new kid? Your boy Joey got this, man, you know that. He's the man, right? Right, well, let's see it. Hit him up. Hello? What up, man? When's the footage gonna be ready? Yeah, dude, I'm just finishing up your video now, and I'll move on to Caleb's footage next. Good, good. I wanna see how good this guy really is. For sure, man, I'll, I'll bring it over as soon as I'm done. Good, and, Joey, you make sure he shows up for this thing. You got it. Alright, talk to you later. Bye-bye. Let's go. Come on. And that means no surfing. Have you ever watched him surf, David? Yo. Hey, you're here finally. Yeah. What's up? Skate Down. What about it? Tomorrow night Ryder wants to challenge you. Who's Ryder? He's the king of Skate Down. If you beat him, you get sponsored. That simple. Yeah, well, I don't think I can do it. What, why not? My mom's in the hospital. You know, the winner gets 3,000 bucks. Hello? I'll be right there. Hey! Oh, man. I'm in. Are you serious? Good, man! Yes, yes, alright. So, where's it at? Um, I don't know. They let us know about an hour beforehand. Okay- Oh, um, yeah. One more thing I forgot to mention. It costs four bills to get in. Four hundred dollars? Sorry. How am I supposed to... I gotta go. Sorry for calling you a geek. I didn't mean it. Where you going? Come on. Okay- What're you doin'? What's it look like I'm doing? It looks like you don't know what you're doing. Well, you think you could do better? Dude, I forged more notes in my senior year than my mom will ever know. I like the confidence. Watch the skill. You're making me nervous. You're making me nervous, man. Huh? That's pretty good. Ah, I get ten percent. Yeah, if I win. When you when. Come on, let's show 'em what you got. To the bank. To the bank. Excuse me. Are you family? What? Oh, I'm 3... We share a son. Caleb? Great kid. Thank you. I'm, uh, I'm Jack, Jack Sanders. Dr. Sheldon. What, what happened? She suffered a major brain hemorrhage, and because of the tumor things got-- Tumor? Is it operable? We don't know yet. Is Caleb aware of all this? My God. Okay, well, there it is. Um, I want you to make sure that she has the very best of care. Whatever she needs, whenever she needs it. That's... What? I'm afraid that her insurance doesn't cover a majority of the work that we've already done. I don't care about her insurance, alright? I will take care of the bill. I want her to have the very best of care. Whatever she needs, whenever she needs it. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Okay, and I'll have my secretary call up and she'll take care of all the paper work. Oh. Thank you. You bet. I don't wanna hear it. This is the third time this week you've pushed the appointment with the developers. Yeah. Do you think anybody really cares about perfection anymore? Perfection? Yes, perfection. I don't understand how you mean that, sir. Come on up here. Look out this window. Tell me what you see. Buildings. Yes, those are buildings, but what would the city look like if those buildings were all just four walls propped up with an occasional window here and there? What would it look like then? I don't know. It would look ugly. Now granted you have to squint your eyes every now and again to be able to see it, but out there is beauty. What's out there is art. Art is passion. If you don't have passion, you should just stay out of it. I'll set up the meetings for early next week. You wanted to see me? Yeah, have a seat. Bill, we have another problem. Jack, I checked every inch of those prints, and I know they're ready. I know it. Oh, the prints are fine. The prints have been approved. You did a really good job on the prints. What's the problem? The problem is the client wants to change the layout. The Kobayashi building? Oh, they can't do that. That project's almost finished. Plus, it's gonna cost another what? Hundred grand for a new set of prints? Which just happens to be my favorite part. That means we have to get started right away. Right away? Yeah, right away. As in now. Go get your Stuff. It's almost six o'clock and I promised my son I'd make his game tonight. Your son's baseball game? Yeah, he's in the playoffs. And what exactly do you think this is, Bill? Hm? The Kobayashi account happens to be one of our biggest accounts. Do I have to remind you that I've given up everything in my entire life in order to be in the position I'm in today, and I dragged you right along beside me? Your son's little baseball game is not part of the equation. You need to prioritize. This is way more important than that. What? No. No? No, it's not. You know what's important, Jack? Let me take a wild stab at this, Bill. What's important might be your career. You listen to me for a second. I gave you an opportunity, an opportunity that a lot people would've killed for. Now, you have an obligation to this company, and you, young man, you owe me. Okay, you're right. I do have an obligation to this company, and I prove that every day that I am here, but I also have an obligation to my family, Jack, and I'm not gonna let anything interfere with that. Including this job. You walk out that door, Bill, and it is over for you. Everything you have ever worked for. And what is that everything, Jack? Hm? Houses on the beach, luxury vacations, your fancy Corvette? I used to think like you. Money, success, all I ever wanted, but you know what? I have barely seen my family since the promotion, and that is... I am prioritizing. My family- They are the equation, Jack. They're everything I really feel sorry for you, Jack. I really do. Alright, bring it in. Looks like that new kid's not gonna show up. Let's get this thing started. What's up man? I thought you said he was gonna be here. That's what Joey said. Well, he'd better be for Joey's sake. This guy's weak. Hey wait up, wait up. I'm here. Luke, get his money. He's got it, he's got it. Bring the money? Give it to Joey. Are you serious right now? You don't trust me? Joey holds the money. Wow, man. Don't lose it, papa. Me? Never. Alright, listen up. Roberto? Alright everybody got the course memorized? Yeah. Alright let's do this. Let's get this started! Ready? Three, two, One, go! What is this? Well I was on the way home from my beat, and I ran into him and his knucklehead friends. So let's get him on trespassing and felony vandalism. Okay, step over here. A seat right here. Go ahead and dial nine and whatever number you need to call. I don't have anyone to call. Well then, you're going to be staying here. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, I have someone I can call. Well then go ahead and dial nine and your number then. How much was my bail? Don't worry about it. I'll pay you back. Yeah. Is this how you spend your days, Caleb? Hmm? Not always. Sometimes I like to, I like to rob liquor stores. This is serious. Alright, it's very very serious. You now have a record. Congratulations, you-- Wow. Wow, all of a sudden you care. It's cool how that happens, Just like that. What is going on with you? The sergeant called me, the sergeant said that the charges were trespassing and vandalism? Really? Vandalism and trespassing? That's great. What is going on with you? What do you think is going on? I have no idea or I wouldn't be asking. What is it? We're getting evicted. Look until a couple of days ago, you were just-- What? I was what, another bill for your accountant to pay? Can I finish a sentence please? You haven't even gone to see her. I-- It doesn't matter. Just, pull over, please? Pull over, I want to go. Fine I'll pull over. Thank you would have been really nice. Thanks a lot. I can't believe your parents let you party here. Yeah well my stepdad's playing golf, my mom's probably passed out on the couch. You a beer man? No. So it's a bummer, huh? About your boy Caleb getting arrested. Ah, well, who says he's my boy? Man you would have destroyed him if the cops didn't show up. I don't know, man. What'd you say? What, no, I was just saying, I was saying that he... You guys were both ripping. It's cool man, it's cool. Yo, you want me to take care of-- No, I got him. No, I heard what you said. And you know what? And you're right. Are you serious-- He's right. Are you kidding me right now? I got to know who's better. You're gonna just let him slide like that? Joey, come here. You're gonna get him to do it again. I don't know if I can do that, I have no idea if he would want to... I mean he just got picked up but the police And I don't know if I can, he's the cops got... okay. Gonna get him to do it again, right? Right? Okay- Joey I can't quite hear you. Alright, I'll get him to do it again. Okay- Fine. We are friends, Joey, huh? Let's keep it that way. You make it happen, friend. What do you think you're doing? Going to skate. I don't think so. The only reason I let you hang out here is because my mom married your dad. This is not your ramp. And we'll never be bros, huh? You get it? Yeah, got-- Get out of here. Tight. Ah, yes, can I speak to a Mr. Samuels? Caleb Jones. Than ks. Hi, yeah, Mr. Samuels this is Caleb Jones, I live at, listen we're having a hard time paying our rent this month and... Wait, what do you mean, who-- who? Yeah, no that's okay. Yeah, thanks anyway. I don't know how to say this, Beth. Time, I don't know how. It's been what, almost twenty years? It seems impossible. So much has changed and yet I, I never stopped loving you. Ah, Caleb he's a great kid and I think he hates me right now. And I don't really blame him because I kind of hate myself a lot of the time. Oh, the mistakes I've made, Beth. I wish I... Wish it hadn't taken this to bring us together. Please forgive me. Beth I am so sorry for not being there for you, and not being there for Caleb. What are you doing here? I just came, um... If you want me to leave I'll leave. Say the word. How is she? No change. I'm going to get some coffee. You want some coffee? I'll get you a cup. I'll have a water. Coming right up. Mom, I am so sorry for everything. Everything I know, I know that everything you did was to protect me. I know that. I just, I just want you to wake up. Please. Please wake up. Please forgive me. For the bible does tell us all, as being Christians, that to be absent from this body, means to be present with Him. And we know in our hearts, That Bethany is with Him today. Now cherishing the memories that are forever precious. Sustained by a faith that is stronger than death, And comforted by a hope of a life that shall endless be. All that is mortal, Of our beloved Bethany, We therefore commit, To this final resting place. In these beautiful surroundings. In the assurance that if this earthly tin of our body, being dissolved, we have a building from God, Not made with hands, but one that will return to the dust from which it came. Let us bow in prayer, please. Lord Jesus we thank You so much. That we serve a God, That's infinite yet here today. And that You care so much about what's going on in our hearts, in our lives. Caleb. Caleb! What? What do you want? Where are you going? Away from here. What about your mother's funeral? I can't keep pretending that you're my father. Or that my mom's gonna be home when I get there. She's dead. And I can't stop thinking that If you were there to help she wouldn't be. Okay you listen to me a second. A lovely woman is dead, yes that's true, But I loved her too. Okay and I'm sorry, I wasn't there-- She deserves a lot more from you than "sorry." Jack. I wish you two had never met. Hey. Like it or not, I'm your father. No you're not. A father is someone who takes care of his family, who is there for his family when they need him. All you are is some guy that got my mom pregnant and you left. When I was seven, all the kids at school had their dads come and talk about what they do. And I told everyone that my dad couldn't make it because, because he was an astronaut. I have never forgot that feeling, I just wanted to disappear. You've got no idea what you've lost. I think I do. And I have to live with that, every day of my life because now, it's too late. And you believe me, all that hatred, all that anger you feel inside toward me I feel it toward myself tenfold. Tenfold. I know I made mistakes. I know l said things and I know that I can't take those things back, but you are a man and I am asking you, as a man to please dig inside yourself and see if maybe you just can forgive me. Give me a shot, give me a chance One chance. What does the Lord say about forgiveness? And Peter came to him and asked, Lord, how many times should I forgive someone who has sinned against me? Seven times? And the Lord said no, not seven times. But seventy times seven. Now is the time to confess your sins and ask forgiveness before it's too late. God is good. Is he Ralf? Is God good? God is always good. My mom's dead. How good can he be? What do you want? I want my money back. I ain't got your money. Yeah? Where's Ryder? I don't know, he's somewhere, he's around, I don't know. Well tell him I want my money back. I don't even know why you're stressing, you would have lost it anyways, so, just chill man. Tell Ryder, I'm gonna get my money back. Yo, you don't belong out here, alright? Go back to where you belong, son. That's right, punk. Come on. Where'd you keep this at, Mom? Why would you do this to me? Did I do something to deserve this? I want to die. See what your plan is for me now, God. Caleb? Caleb? Are you here? Caleb? Caleb? Hey! Caleb, No, no, no, no, Caleb, hey! Caleb, hey, come on! Wake up, son! Caleb! Doctor Sheldon, this is Jack Sanders, Caleb's father. Listen, I'm afraid that Caleb might have gotten into some of his mother's medication and I would like you to take a look at him, because I'm afraid that he might have overdosed. I don't know what it was, but it was only supposed to be one every four hours, and he took a whole lot more than that. If you don't mind it's kind of a sensitive issue. I'd like you to come to my house if you don't mind. Thank you. Just pumped his stomach, He's doing fine, now. Vitals are strong. He just needs to get some sleep. Doc, I found your cell number on that card in his back pocket, so, can we just, keep this between you and I? Yeah. He's been through a lot. I'm happy to have helped. He has, look, I can't... I can't thank you enough. What-- Take good care of your son. Well good morning, sunshine. Or should I say good late afternoon? Look I got you a nice, well, now cold, greasy cheeseburger. Great for a hangover. Come on down, I'll stick it in the microwave. Ah. Forty-five minute shower. You've obviously never paid a water bill in your life. Have a seat. How you feeling? I feel like, like a dinosaur bit my head. I like that. That's a good one. I like it, I'm using that. Can I ask you a question? Yeah. Go ahead, shoot Why didn't you want me? I was young, I was stupid. And I'm very sorry. Where's the burger? I ate it. You serious? No, it's in the microwave. Heated it up three times, it's probably hard as a rock. I'll eat anything right now. What's that supposed to mean? Think that's really gonna help? I didn't know anybody knew about this spot. They don't man. I'm Brian. Caleb. So you want to skate or what? No, man, I kind of just wanted to be... To be alone? I know how that goes, I know how you feel. Oh you think so? Yeah. Been to plenty of spots just like this back home. I go skate there all the time. All by myself, all alone. Where's home? Liverpool, back in England. You know when I was going through some stuff, the challenges of life, the things that I tried to drink away or party away or smoke away perhaps, but that never really helped. Well then what helps? Take it easy, man. Good talking to you Caleb. Yo. Thought you wanted to skate? Thought you wanted to be alone? Grab your board, let's go, let's go skate. Your father will not forgive your sins. Dear Caleb, If you are reading this, my prayers have been answered. I know growing up without a father has been very hard for you and I know I haven't always been the best mother. But I've always tried to do what I thought was best for you. I love you so much, that I thought if I made you believe that your father and I were a one time encounter that you would hurt less. I know now that I was wrong for that, and I'm very sorry. The truth is, that I loved your father, and I still do, and you were created from that love. So I hope you can find it in your heart some day to forgive me. I love you. Mom. Caleb? Hey Ralf. Why do you do this? Do what? This, why do you, why do you live like this? It enables me to spread the word of God. What about your family? It was Easter Sunday. Me and my wife and my daughter were going on a three day trip to visit my mother in law for Easter. Do you like my dress, daddy? It's beautiful, sweetheart. Are we ready to go to grandma's? Yeah! It's my secretary, she wouldn't page me unless it was really important. Honey, you promised no work till we get back. My secretary called and I forgot to sign off on a case that had to be postmarked the next day. I had to go to the office. So I sent my wife and my daughter to go ahead. They never made it. Drunk driver crossed the line. Hit 'em head on. I should have been driving. My daughter would be twenty-two today. After that I just gave up. I couldn't accept the fact that I'd never see them again. Never hold my wife or hear my daughter say Daddy, I love you. Sol crawled into a bottle and took whatever pills I could get my hands on, What happened to the driver? He got three years for manslaughter. I hated that man more than anything else in the world. I wished every day that the same thing would happen to his family. Till one day, I realized that all that hate was never going to bring 'em back. And it was slowly killing me. So what'd you do? I forgave him. It's time for you to forgive yourself. Sup? I'm really sorry about your mom. Than ks. What're you gonna do about Ryder? What am I supposed to do? You got to do something, man. Why? What's the point of it? Well he keeps... Saying... What? What happened to your lip? Did Ryder do that? Man this has got to stop. Tell Ryder I'm in. But we do it my way. The skate park. Sorry. Big day, Jack. You alright? Huh? What, uh, yeah. Yes, I'm fine. 'Cause if you're concerned about the meeting today with the inspector, it's not-- No, not concerned, not concerned at all. In fact I think your plan is just great. Great. You know, a very wise man once told me, in fact he was standing right about where you are now, that his family was more important than his job. And I could never seem to wrap my mind around that until today. So I would like to thank you. For accepting my apology, and for coming back to the firm. You're welcome, Jack. I got to go. What the... what about the meeting? I've got something far more important than that meeting. You have a good day, Bill. Enjoy it, partner. Okay- Hey, Ryder! Hosoi. Sup buddy huh? ' No, no, no, no. What's the problem? You think the only reason I sponsor you is because you're some great skateboarder? I don't know what you're talking about. Man if you search deep down in your heart, Ryder, you'll discover why l sponsored you in the first place. Man, these kids. Yep, what's it going to benefit them if they gain the whole world? They forfeit their own souls. Yo, Joey. Hey, JOEY- Where's your boy? He'll be here. Yeah, I hope he doesn't chicken out. Yo, made it. Hey where you been? Had to fix my board. Is your boy ready? Yeah man, I'm ready. You sure? Yeah. It's trick for trick. If someone misses a trick, the other skater gets to choose the next trick. Clear? YEP - Okay- Alright, flip a coin, see who goes first. Who calls? I'll call it. Heads. Yeah. Heads. Ryder goes first. I get first trick. Let's see if you can keep up. Let's see. Yeah. Come on, man. What's going on, man? Dude, I cracked my trucks. It's over. What? Is that it? Huh, you giving up? Oh man, you're such a baby. Don't listen to him, man, You got to try. Caleb. And you know what? Chill. Maybe it's time you tried this. So what are you gonna do? Hardflip backlip. You serious? Do you really think now's the time to be doing something you've never done before? Now's the perfect time. Alright. Kill it.
