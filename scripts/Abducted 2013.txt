It's your last chance to play the truth game. Mm-hmm. You know what we should do? Hmm? Play the truth game tomorrow. Oh, my God. Do you promise that you will? Oh, I promise. Dave? Dave? Dave?! Why do you always leave me in the dark, alone? I'm sorry, baby, I was just taking a photo. Come here, I'm scared. Okay, I'm here now, it's okay. Don't do that. I won't. Ugh, ew, gross. I don't like bugs. I don't know why you have to put on boots every single time you see a spider. It's day two of our California vacation. And today we're going to tell each other three truths that we've never told each other before. I'm not doing it. Come on, you promised, I'll go first. Dave... I hate the New York Knicks. What? No, you don't. I do. Years, we've been watching Knicks games together and suddenly now you tell me. It's your turn. I don't like that butterfly tattoo on your ass. You are such a jerk! You've kissed it a million times. By accident. That is not fair, I was 17 and drunk. You've done lots of stupid things, you just... don't have a mark on your ass to prove it. See, this is dangerous! No, no. No what? No more. What do you mean no more... why? Because you've eaten that entire bag. Here, I'll split half of this chocolate bar with you. So you're doing me a favor by eating half of it? Remember that, remember that, for when we get married... By keeping the chips that I did want. Fat husband, kind wife. That is a very large knife that you are holding. The guy at the store said it was the largest knife you could fold up and put in your pocket. I'll just hold on to it. You ready for number two? Sure. I don't like that you don't ever stick up for me in front of your friends. What are you talking about? You don't, come on. Yes, I do. No, you don't. Yes, I do. And I always stick up for you. My turn. I don't think that you think I'm good at what I do. What? I think you're very good at what you do. I think you can try harder but I think you're good at what you do. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Christy. We're not gonna be late. We're not gonna be late, Christy. See that? You're sister's right. That's me sticking up for you. Thank you, thank you. Yeah. Yeah, that's nice. Yep, okay, bye. We made it through one and two. Give me three. Come on. Hmm, I don't wanna play this game anymore. Please? We still have to get through dinner with your sister. Ahh! What's wrong? Ahh... Something just hit me. What? Ahh, ahh... Fuck, fuck. 9-1-1, what's your emergency? Me and my girlfriend are being abducted. I'm escaping right now. What is your name, sir? Dave Roberts and Jessica Marino. Where is your location, starting with your street name? I don't have a street name, I'm on a trail. Can you track me? Are you in immediate danger? Yes, just get to Mount Hollywood, that's where they got my girlfriend right now. Sir, sir, hello? I think I just heard them, I have to go. I'm still on the trail, can you track me or not? Can you track me or not... hello? Sir, hello? Have you located me yet? Yes, now we have you. You're on the south side of the mountain. Keep heading towards the Observatory. I'm dispatching a patrol car. Okay. Keep this line open. Stop, stop, help me! Ahh! Dave? Dave? Dave, is that you? Who are you? Can you say something? You all right? Are you hurt? I'm okay. What did you see? Um, I just remember getting shot and I woke up here. What happened to you? The same. Dave, who would do this to us? I don't know, I have no idea. I'm scared, I'm really scared. I know, I know. But at least we're together. Yeah. It's me and you. Hello! No... No, please. It's okay. It's okay, we're just gonna take this one breath at a time, okay? Just one breath at a time. Okay, okay. Breathing's good. I'm gonna go walk around and see what's here. You stay put, okay? I wanna know where you're at, at all times. Okay. I just bumped into something. It's a toilet. This feels like a bench. It's bolted down, it won't move. Fuck, this is a... this is a mattress. A sink. A light switch. We're in some kind of prison cell. It's my fucking father. You don't know that. Come on, my father's position. Hold on to me tight, Jess. Ahh! Something's got me! Don't breathe. Don't breathe, Jess. Oh, my God. Dave, Dave... Dave! Dave, wake up, look, our hands are free, look. Are you hurt? Mmm. Are you okay? Um-hmm. What grabbed you? I don't know, it was like a... metal vice grip. What's going on? Who are you? It's food. That's why there's this gap here. So they can slide this under like we're in a cage. What are we, lab rats? It could be poison. Why go to the trouble of poisoning us if they could just kill us? Ahh! It's probably... cement up there. There's a security camera. What does that mean? What do you want from us, who are you? If this is about Jessica's father, she hates him. Come out! Ooh! Dave, Dave, are you okay? Are you okay, what happened? What happened... are you okay? Oh, my God, it's our clothes. My phone. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Oh my God, I've got full power. Oh, please, please, please, please. Please, come on, come on, come on. I have full reception. Phones yes, but... knife, no. That figures. Why would they give us our phones if our phones actually worked? They gave me my watch. All my apps are wiped out too. And a chocolate bar. I don't even have date and time on the screen. And one stick of gum. And my nail polish. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Here we are, at the beginning of our vacation, abducted in LA. We don't know why we're here. And we don't know who abducted us. And this could be the last proclamation of what's happening to us. We were kidnapped right out of Griffith Park, and just placed in this cell and our only contact has been with someone who uses these metal pincers to grab us like we're fucking wild animals. And there's this weird wheezing sound every time they come around. They gave us our phones back and there's no reception... it's fucking creepy. And they're watching our every move on a security camera. I'm scared shitless. Where are you going? I'm going to flash them. Ahh! Dave? Dave?! Ah. Oh... It's day two and Dave is gone. I've been passed out for 12 hours and, uh, I'm officially freaking out. There's this thing on the top of my spine. I'm gonna use the camera to record it now. I feel stuffed but I haven't eaten anything. I want Dave. Please come back, Dave, please come back, Dave. Come on, come on. Fuck! It's day four. There's still no Dave. That fucking light is going to drive me insane. I just... I don't... I don't understand how kidnapping me and Dave is going to change the world. Yeah, yeah? Something's happening inside my body. Like my hormones are changing. Maybe it's getting off the pill, I don't know. Come on, just give me something. Dave. Hello? Are you okay? Oh, no! Ahh, get off of me! Get off of me! Get off! Please! Please, I don't wanna die! Jessica? Are you okay? I woke up in a hospital room. There was a... there was a dead abductor on the ground. I tried to escape. I saw... I saw a news webpage, and there were pictures, our pictures were next to pictures of my dad in Afghanistan. It has to be the Taliban. Fuck, you were right. Oh my God. It's day five. It is the Taliban. I escaped and I saw a news headline and Dave found an ear. So that backs it up. It's probably some sort of sleeper cell that's been in the U.S. for a while. And I found this little kid. They kidnapped a kid. She was 10, 12 years old. It's so creepy. A kid? And Dave has that same wound on the back of his neck. We both have needle marks on our arms, it's fucked. I tried a protein bar. You ate the rat pellets? That or starve. They turned the lights on. Yeah, now we can see what a shithole we're in. Do you hear that breathing? Hello? Who the fuck are you? Please don't hurt us. Who are you? I'm Justin. Summer. Who kidnapped you? I... I don't... know. My name's Dave. This is my girlfriend, Jessica. We we're kidnapped in Griffith Park. Summer, this is my fault. We knew four people were already missing from the park and... and we walked right by the poster, and now we're here. I'm so sorry, I'm sorry. Four people? Posters? What did the posters say? We... we didn't look at it. I read online that the police were using blood hounds in the park, and all they ended up finding was a Flip cam. My Flip camera. That means the cops must have a good lead. There wasn't any talk about hostages, or... or... or ransom notes from the Taliban? No. Did you see them? No. Here. Here, put this on, wrap it around like a skirt. It'll make you feel better. The rest of your clothes should come soon... part of their procedure to strip you down, and make you huddle in the dark. How old are you two? When were you guys kidnapped? Saturday, around 7:00 p.m. What time is it now? Um, I think by our calculations it should probably be about Sunday morning. We've been joined by two new victims, Justin and Summer, who also have no idea why they've been abducted. Do you two have any military connections? What? Any reason why the Taliban would kidnap you? No. Justin... it's your mom and dad. Hey, okay, is this like a boot camp, like... like some kind of intervention? I don't think so. 'Cause they found some pot in Justin's room and they threatened to send him away. I mean... it's gotta be it. Believe me, this is not a boot camp. Are either of your parents rich? Justin's father is Jerry Weiner, you know, the big movie producer? Maybe this is about ransoms? Yeah, we found this little girl. I mean, maybe she's being held, too. Okay, Justin... Dave? Hello? Summer? Oh, fuck. Where is Dave? What are you doing? What are you doing? No! No, no, no! Fuck you, no! No, no, no, no, no, no! Are you okay? Hey, what happened? Ow... What is that? Don't... don't touch. What is it? Don't touch it. Can I look? It hurts. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What did they do? What, did they take out your kidney? What is that? Fuck! Just take our fucking body parts one by one, sell it off to the highest bidder? They look like fucking metal staples. Jesus. It's okay, you're fine, you're okay, you're okay. Ahh! Wow... the first ones. What? Your 9-1-1 call got a lot of people down to Griffith Park hoping to be the chosen ones. What the fuck are you talking about? We wanted to get abducted. Why? You don't know who abducted you? No, do you? They're aliens. They're not fucking aliens. You got a scar? Yeah. Aliens. I got mine a couple of days ago... ah! They entered your body, right? I can feel a worm, crawling around inside me. Ah! I don't feel anything inside me, so I don't buy it. Hello, I'm Elliot. That's Maria, she's totally freaked out. She's writing her dissertation on alien abductions. But now that it's happened, she's comatose. They're abducting couples to repopulate Earth with human aliens. I guess we should be rejoicing, huh, Dave? I mean, if it's gonna be between aliens and the Taliban, I'd take aliens any day. You guys are insane. I'm a Harvard PhD'er with degrees in Physics and Philosophy with an IQ rated in the top percentile of the human population. Maria believes that's why the nabbed us, and, we're not even a couple. That doesn't make any sense. I mean, why take Jessica and me? We're regular people. Males are the chosen ones. Females are the egg farm. Got it. Did the aliens send you to put out their message, to be the Messiah? I don't believe in any of this alien crap. Have as many as you want. They're running experiments to determine our body status for future use, controlling exactly what we eat, so I say eat. In the blue room I saw something that said Nevada five, Jeff Miller, RIP, 2009. Yep, Miller, he's on our list. The count was up to nine in Nevada, 12 in Boston, six in New York. In that same room I found an ear. Seems to be a bit more of a ransom move. Think that Getty kid back in the '70s. They're running transfusions through our kidneys. Think about it. Elliot, you're full of shit! Where's the proof? Not once have I seen one alien gadget that can't be bought here on "off the shelf" planet earth. Here's why, if the FBI ever captures one, there won't be anything to positively identify them as alien, no smoking ray-guns. That's your proof? No proof is your proof? Are you saying that we're like Adam and Eve? That's exactly what he's saying, they're rounding up a new herd, taking us two-by-two, walking us up the plank to the alien fucking ark. Aliens, no need to gas us, we're on your side. One time we're gonna get gassed and not wake up. If we die, I just don't wanna die alone. That's why you got me. Let's get married... right now. It's too sad. No, it's not. I'll record it... and we can still have a wedding video. So... in case we miss our future wedding, do you, Jessica Marino, take me, Dave Roberts, to be your lawfully wedded husband? I do. Do you, Dave Roberts... take Jessica Marino to be your lawfully wedded wife? I do. By the power vested in me, in the middle of this cell, I now pronounce us... husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Day seven. I read a book on prison once by the French writer Albert Camus. And he goes through the four stages of how to break down a prisoner. One, you strip them of everything. Two, you make them grovel for the most basic human fucking needs. Three, you confuse the ever-living fuck out of them by unexplainable changes in their routine, shuffling prisoners in and out. And then you follow that up with long, long, long lonely periods of isolation. Well, you fucking forgot one thing, Camus, the fucking, freaking, goddamned red light! That helps! That fucking helps! Come out! Come the fuck out! Come on! Is this funny for you? Fucking laugh at! Come on, I'll tear this whole fucking place apart! Come on! It's gas, cover your mouth. Cover your mouth! Get ready to run. Run! Get the light! Let's go. Fuck. There's a kid! No! Fuck! Fuck! Who the hell are you? We're getting out of here. Shit yeah, come on, Tiffany, get your stuff. Oh, my God! Get back, get back! Stop it! Please, stop, you're going to kill him! Stop it! You okay? What up? You all right, man? What the fuck? Buzz, it's Dave, from Griffith Park 8. There's eight of us now? He has no idea what's going on. Shut up, Tiffany, the guy's hurting. Look, Buzz, he has the same scar as you. Watch it, watch it. Fucker Tased me right in the wound. It's Dave and Jessica, right? What do you know? Hey, man, shh, they're watching. Yeah. Is it the Taliban? Listen, I can get on the Internet, not now, sometimes late at night. What? Our phones don't work. Your phone sucks. This thing is the shit. They don't seem to care that I can get on the Internet. I mean, what difference does it make? It's not like I can tell anyone where we are, can I? Can the cops trace your signal? Scrambled. This place is high-tech, man. Haven't you guys noticed that your phones never go down? Tesla's dream, no wires, no cords. Secret government mojo. They've been stealing people off the street for some secret, genetic mission. They're creating a super-human. Oh, Christ, not this shit again. Dude, it's all on the Internet. Those protein bars you've been eating, full of hormones, doing weird shit to us. Like stopping your hair and nails from growing, never taking a shit, turning your pee pink. It's freaky shit, man. My beard hasn't grown in at all. Yeah, right there, Griffith Park 8. There's no mention of a little girl? No. Just young couples in our prime. If they don't care that he's making connections to the outside world, then they don't give a shit about being caught. Yeah, problem is, everyone thinks my Facebook updates are a hoax. The abductors broke my phone camera so I can't send pictures. They know exactly what they're doing. Well, let me log into my Facebook. No. If we both say the same thing our our status, the outside world might believe it. All right, fine. Okay, here's what I'm gonna say. You say the same thing. Oh, shit, come on! What's going on here?! What are you doing?! Hey, what are you doing? Stop! Get back! No, get off! Buzz, Buzz, are you okay? Fuck, that hurt. Oh. It's gone. What? They took my phone. Now we're screwed. You fuck! This is your fucking fault. How? You are officially persona non grata, ass-wipe. Give me one of your phones. Fuck you. Yeah, get the fuck over there. I don't wanna see your ugly face. Stop it! Please go, please. Somebody's gonna find us. Don't cross this line! Have a little faith. This is my cell, my domain! You hear me? There is no room for anyone else! Okay. This will keep us going. Describe walking into your favorite place. I'll go first. Getting off the G, we're walking past over to the diner, and smelling all that greasy food. And then walking up to that dirty door that you hate touching, and running up the steps... ...and unlocking the door to our apartment. And Felix is meowing. Aw, poor Felix. Yeah. Poor Felix. Sitting in my brothers place, getting fatter... and fatter by the minute. You little bastard. Give me one of your phones, goddamn it. Ahh! Buzz, what are you doing? Get over there! Give it to me or I'll fucking kill you. This'll take care of your ass. Oh! Get off of him! Give me the phone! Get off! Get off, get off! Are you all right? So they're only jacking couples, which means that that little girl isn't a hostage, she has to be their kid. Well, if it's not the Taliban and it's not kidnappers, sure as shit ain't the government. We don't know that. I mean, think about what the government did to unsuspecting citizens in the '50s. They gave them LSD, they did nuclear tests. Yeah. What was your third truth? I don't remember. Wasn't anything too revealing. I was not trying to make you any more mad than the first two truths made you. Fine. I have one since. Since we've been here? When we were abducted, I woke up, and I looked for you... we were still on the peak. And I went running down the mountainside, towards the Observatory. I thought I'd made it. I was flagging down this van. You just left me? No. I was... I was trying to get us help. I was on the phone with 9-1-1. I was trying to get us rescued. Why didn't you tell me earlier? When would've been a good time to tell you that, Jessica? You're so guilty. When? Jessica hasn't spoken to me in hours... and I'm starting to lose it. Jess, I need you to talk to me, please. Jess, where are you? Tell me where you are. Dammit, this is not the fucking time to be mad at me, where are you? Who's there? Maria? Where's Elliot? I don't know. Jessica? Jessica. We only have each other right now, please. You just left me. You're a coward. It wasn't the bravest thing I've done. I've never been in a fight before... ...except for in the third grade, and I lost. I probably wouldn't have married you if you wore wife-beaters. I love you. I love you. Okay, Morris, it's time to jump through the hoop. Come on. Come on, Morris. Come on. Jump through the hoop, Morris. Da-da Come on, Morris. Come on, I feel it. It's coming, here it is, here it is. Oh, come on, you tiny little alien bug. Yes, yes. You did it! Hey! Ahh, Morris, you're a champ. You two are really losing it. That's the first thing you've said in ten hours. We're losing it? I'm studying UFOs at UCLA. You can study UFOs at UCLA? I saw my first UFO when I was ten, March 13, 1997, Phoenix, Arizona, thousands of people saw it. For 20 minutes a spaceship hovered over downtown. You can look it up on YouTube. I can't, actually. Don't you get it? We're on a spaceship. We're not on a spaceship. Why do you think they wear oxygen masks when they come in here? Gassing's been around since World War I. Armies going in and gassing the shit out of the enemies, using gas masks to protect themselves. Which is why they don't touch us. Why they use pincers. To avoid contact with human viruses. It's the same thing that killed off the Aztecs. The avatar's are here, among us. That's a really, really... nice theory, Maria, but unfortunately, I don't think it's anything nearly as fun as that. I can't find my kidney. They're harvesting organs, okay. Do you know how much money can be made in that? Goodbye, Morris. This is one small step for bug and one giant leap for "bugkind." Go out that way. Go. It was good meeting you. Don't forget to write. Maria... wake up. It's completed. Come on! Where is she, huh? You hear me down here? You better not hurt her! You better not hurt her! Oh, my God! Oh, my God... ow. It's food, it's real food. It's lots and lots of real food... oh, my God. Mmm, oh my God, look at this. Look at... oh my God, mmm, mmm. Oh my God... it's so good. It could be poison. They don't need us anymore. They've got plenty of our eggs. I mean, how many Jessicas do they need? I don't know. I don't really think about it. Well, I'm not touching that stuff. I'll wait to see if you croak. Okay, I'll be your guinea pig... mmm. Oh, Morris, you're going to be a star. Your name up in lights. Come on, come through the hoop. Come on. He's doing it. Okay, come on. Come on, give me something. Please, God, give me something. Fucking shit. Please, please, please, please, please. Oh my God. Oh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. I have bars... oh my God... come on. Come on. Please... Hi, you've reached the Marino residence. Thank you for your kind messages. All our thoughts are with Jessica and Dave, and we pray they are safe and will return soon. Hi, Mommy. It's me, um, it's... it's Jessica. Uh, hi, I'm okay, um... If you can... if you can trace this phone call then maybe you can find us, we don't know who has us. But I'm okay, I'm okay, sort of. Please. Fuck, fuck! Come on, Christy. Give me something. Oh my God, come on, Christy. Please answer, please answer. Jessica? Oh my God. Jessica is that... Christy, can you hear me? Oh my God, Jessica, hello, are you there? Hi, yeah, it's me, can you hear me? Jess, hello, I can barely hear you, hello? Christy, don't hang up, please don't hang up. Hi, hi. Can you hear me now? Hello, please... fuck, I need help. Please. I just had my sister on the phone. What are you doing? Call 9-1-1! Oh my God, oh my God. Fuck, they shut off my phone. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Ahh! Oh my God. Jesus. Okay. Ahh! Oh, my God. Oh my... please don't be Dave. Oh my God, oh. Oh, Summer, I'm so sorry. Oh, oh... I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Maria, Maria, come on. Come on, look at me, wake up. Come on, we're breaking out, get up. Maria, we're breaking out, get up. Come on, get up. Come on. Oh my God! It's been weeks... and still no Jessica. I've completely lost track of time. And I'm going fucking crazy. And I thought that they abandoned us here to die, and then they shove more goddamned protein bars under the door. There's Justin. He's been here... ...a while. He just got back from surgery. And he hasn't seen Summer in forever either. Okay, Justin, go ahead. Take a look. Man... This greenish puss, is it... gangrene? I feel something inside of me, moving. We need to get out of here. Have you noticed that they've been shorthanded the last couple weeks? It's the only reason you and I are in here together. They wait until we fall asleep. They send the short, limping one in here to collect our bandages. He's very weak. He's deteriorating. He stinks. We take two cloths, we're going to wet them, lay down as if we are going to sleep, and when they come in here to gas us, I want you to take that cloth and put it over your mouth. What makes you think that that will work? They are human. We can kill them. Oh, gross. The only reason they come in here is to keep it sanitary. We get him when he comes over here to pick these up. I'll keep my foot on your arm, I'll tap you when he walks through the door to make sure you're still awake. Just like that. Justin, get the light! Get the light, Justin! He's human. He's got some fucking disease. Let's go. Let's go find Jessica and Summer. No, no, no! Fuck! They must've put this in since the last time we escaped. He probably has keys. I'm gonna run back and I'm gonna see if he has any keys on him, okay? I want you to stay here and keep a lookout. If you see anyone, I want you to scream to me, okay? Don't... don't... don't leave me alone here, Dave. Justin, stay right here and yell as loud as you can if you see anyone. My buck knife. I got them! Dave? Are you okay? The lights are out! I can't see anything. Dave! Somebody's coming! Come back! I'm hit. Dave! I've been hit! I'm coming, I'm coming. No, I'm not letting you in. No, I'm not letting you in here. I'm here, Justin, hang in there, hold on. No! Justin, you okay? Fuck! Jessica? Jessica? Fuck! Jessica? Is Jessica in here? Dude, you're still alive? We need to go, Elliot. They experimented on Maria. They implanted a chip in the back of her neck. She came back, puked for hours right in front of me, and died. I'm sorry. But right now we need to get out of here. This is your last chance, Elliot! They tried to turn her into a human-alien hybrid, that's what the abductors are. Jessica? You check this door. Ahh, ahh! What the fuck? Buzz? What's happened to you? Elliot, come on, wake up. Come on. Jessica? Tiffany, wake up. Wake up. Tiffany, Tiffany. Jessica? Jessica. Wake up. Jess, Jess, wake up. Jessica, Jessica. Come on, come on. Wake up, wake up, you okay? We have to get out of here, okay? Up right now. We gotta go, we gotta go. You can put me down. You all right, are you okay? I'm okay. Can you run? Uh-huh. All right. We never left L.A. Oh my God. We're free! Oh, I can't believe it! What happened? I don't know. How long has this been? I don't know, it's less than a month. It looks like it's three months, it's huge. It's one of them. Go to the fire escape, right over here, go. They've got guns! Dave, Dave! Oh my God. Hold me! I love you. Okay? Okay. I love you.
