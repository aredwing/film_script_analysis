Come on. Quickly. Take out your pencils. Write this down. Imbrue-to taint, to stain. The cancer of racism imbrues our national character. It stains the spirit, taints the soul. It is a blot, a shameful, greasy spot on the fabric of our national conscience. Imbrue-to taint, to stain. 30 words tomorrow. Test. What's the matter? They're holding a meeting of the union executive board. Without us? They didn't tell me, either. I told you we couldn't trust them. Keep it down. Those no-good bastards sell us out- out of a union we started? Betray us like a bunch of judases? They won't crucify me. No, sir. I got the hammer and nails. I won't be anybody's martyr, frank. I'm sick and tired of spineless jellyfish. Save it for the meeting. Why, man? I got plenty. I'm the rockefeller of outrage. What the hell are you people doing? We're having a meeting. You're selling us out. We cannot have an effective voice. Our curriculum will be impotent if we sell out every time they threaten us. You want to talk, about this, call me in we have to stick together. What we have to do is pay our bills. You want to carry picket signs. We just want to work. We're tired of the agitation, the posturing of crazy- how can you talk about posturing when you're always bent over kissing posteriors at the school board? You want to step outside? If you had any nerve at all, you'd be fighting on my side. Mr. Clark, i'm afraid that's a moot point. We just found out that the board of education will grant our salary increments if we agree to accept their condition that you be transferred to school 6, and we agreed. God bless you, man. Pay your bills. Joe. They can go to hell. Come on, joe. This place deserves exactly what it gets.

Somebody help me, please! I can't breathe! Somebody open up the door! Open the door, please! Somebody let me out! I just don't goddamn believe it. I've got an election coming up, and you hit me with this now? The state report came from trenton just now. And we... well, actually, they ranked the schools. We were last in the state. Oh, that's a crock. They can't just take my schools away. You're quite right. That's what i thought. But, well, no, see, now, actually, they can. What? The house passed a bill last week. 75% of high school students must pass the minimum basic skills test, or the state takes control by the end of the school year. Well, how many passed last year? About 38%. 38%? What in god's name are they doing down there at eastside? They were your appointees, don. Don't try pinning this on me. You're the superintendent of schools, remember? Now, look, i'm not going down the tubes just because those kids can't pass some test. It's a can of worms, don. The only person who would take this job is someone with nothing to lose then the question becomes what would we want with him? I'm sitting here racking my brain- you're sitting there setting me up. I know you like a book. No, wait a minute. No! No, no, no, no, no, not that nut! No! No way! He's the only guy i can think of. Oh, lord help us. Derrick, derrick, slow down, now. I am, mr. Clark. Slow down! Bye, mr. Clark. So long, kids. Hey, joe. Am i in trouble? You gotta bring your lawyer? Rosenberg. Joe. Hot for october. How's it going over here? Ok. Same old, same old. What brings you down? We came from the mayor's office. They need a new principal at eastside high. Gotta get those test scores up. He specifically thought of you. Sure. Ok. I thought of you. All this time i been stuck down here, and you ask me now, frank. I'm not a miracle worker, joe. Hello, dr. Napier. Mr. Clark, the girls need that room for baking class. We continue to find gum under the desks. I'll make an announcement in the morning. Will that satisfy you? Mrs. Hamilton, you know mr. Rosenberg, the school board attorney. Yes. How are you, mr. Rosenberg? Excuse us, mrs. Hamilton. Dr. Napier wants to inspect our new sandbox. Our sandbox? I didn't mean to interrupt. Good seeing you, dr. Napier. Yes, yes. Forget about what happened before. This is a chance to make changes, stop blowing smoke up each other's butts, see if we can turn this thing around. You mean nobody else wants the job? Nobody i'd want. You add my name to the list. You're bullshit. Don't talk to me about saving those kids. The mayor wants to save his budget, and you want to save your ass. Well, so what. You want the truth, joe? Yeah, frank. Let's have some truth. For all your talk and all your crazy joe routine, what have you done? Nothing! You're nothing but an insignificant man! It's like you were never born. Your life hasn't made any difference. Neither has mine. Want to take that to the grave. We want to welcome mr. Clark to eastside. We've heard so much about you. In anticipation of your arrival, ms. Levias, your other vice principal, and i have appointed an executive committee to oversee certain areas where we have noted a need for improvement- you may sit down, mr. O'malley. You think you can run this school? If you could, then i wouldn't be here, would i? No one talks in my meetings. No one! Take out your pencils and write. I want the names of every hoodlum, drug dealer, and miscreant who's done nothing but take this place apart on my desk by noon today. Reverend slappy. Yes, sir. You're now the chief custodian. You will scour this building clean. Graffiti goes up, it's off the next day. Yes, sir. The very next day. Detention students can help you. Let them scrub this place for a while. And tear down those cages in the cafeteria. You treat them like animals, that's exactly how they'll behave. This is my new dean of security, mr. William wright. He will be my avenging angel as you teachers reclaim the halls. This is an institution of learning. If you can't control it, how can you teach? Discipline is not the enemy of enthusiasm. Mr. Zirella. Yes? Mr. Zirella, you are now my new head football coach. Mr. Darnell. Stand up, mr. Darnell. Mr. Darnell will be your assistant. You know why you're being demoted? Because i'm sick and tired of our football team getting pushed all over the field. Thank you. Sit down. I want precision. I want a weight program. If you don't like it, mr. Darnell, quit. Same goes for the rest of you. You've tried it your way for years. Your students can't pass a minimum basic skills test. That means they can hardly read! They've given me less than one year, one school year to turn this place around, to get those test scores up so the state will not take us over to perform the task which you have failed to do- to educate our children! Forget about the way it used to be. It's not a damn democracy. We're in a state of emergency, and my word is law! There's only one boss in this place, and that's me, the h-n-l-c. Are there any questions? Mr. Wright. The h-n-l-c? The head nigger in charge. Everybody, right up here, right here. Check this out. When i want your body... george, brian, sams, they want you onstage. Let's go. Right now. Mrs. Santos, what about us? What about you? What about me? Sit down. I said sit down. What do they want us for? I don't know. Go. What do you got to do around here to get picked for something? Maria, sit down. Get down get down some guys are lame they want my fame i got a girl with juice her name is deluce, so check it out look at chita, holmes. Let her check me out, man. Afraid of the girlies? Flash some cash, boy. Want some? I'll give you some. Buy her some stupid gold. Step off, man. You're a joke. Is this normal? I'm afraid so. Is everybody on the list onstage? Yes, sir. I gave their names to homeroom teachers. Ladies with the crabs let me hear you say yeah! Who's got the crabs? Mr. Clark. Don't you remember me? Kaneesha. Kaneesha, how are you, baby? You know him? Oh, we go way back. Fifth grade. Yeah. How are things going? Ok. Just ok? Listen, you have any problems, come and see me. I'm in my office every morning at 6:00, ok? Ok. Good to see you. That was my elementary school principal. All right, people. Settle down. Get down off the seats. Settle down. Settle down, boys and girls. Settle down. May i have your attention? Quiet. Quiet down. Take your seats. You people sit down. Sit down. Quiet down. I am your new principal. My name is joe clark. I want you to be quiet! I want you to listen! From here out, there will be no smoking in this school! All of you who are smoking, put out your cigarettes on the soles of your shoes. Put the butts in your pockets now! You, there. You. Put out your cigarette. I'm going to ask the people onstage to open with our school song. Mr. Roland. Boy: Do you believe this guy? Go, go, sing! Suck my dick! You sing the song. You sing it. Joe: All right. That's enough, mr. Roland. That's enough. I want all of you to take a good look at these people on the risers behind me. These people have been here up to five years and done absolutely nothing. These people are drug dealers and drug users. They have taken up space. They have disrupted this school. They have harassed your teachers, and they have intimidated you. Well, times are about to change. You will not be bothered in joe clark's school. Yeah! Shh! These people are incorrigible, and since none of them could graduate anyway, you are all expurgated. You are dismissed. You are out of here forever. I wish you well. Oh, shit. Mr. Wright. I don't need your school. I'm going in the air force, man. Know what i'm saying? You know what i'm saying? I told you, man. You ain't nobody. I'm gonna get you, man. You ain't nobody. Next time it may be you. If you do no better than they did, next time itwillbe you. They said this school was dead like the cemetery it's built on, but we call our eastside teams ghosts, don't we? And what are ghosts? Ghosts are spirits that rise from the dead. I want you to be my ghosts. You are going to lead our resurrection by defying the expectation that all of us are doomed to failure. My motto is simple. If you do not succeed in life, i don't want you to blame your parents. I don't want you to blame the white man. I want you to blame yourselves. The responsibility is yours! In two weeks, we have a practice exam and the minimum basic skills test on april 13th. That's 110 school days from now, but it's not just about those test scores. If you do not have these basic skills, you will find yourselves locked out, locked out of that american dream that you see advertised on tv, that they tell you is so easy to get. You are here for one reason, one reason only- to learn to work for what you want. The alternative is to waste your time and to fall into the trap of crime, drugs, and death. Does everyone understand that? Do all of you understand me? Then welcome to the new eastside high. Mr. Clark don't play. What happened this morning is an outrage. My boy's no criminal. Those children belong in school, not back out on the street. You're a fascist, clark! Our kids don't deserve this! Some of them are smart. They're just discouraged about their chances out there, what kind of jobs they got waitin'. Now what kind of chance do they have? He insulted the black football coach. The man's gone crazy. He's declared war on his own people. Remember, miss barrett, mr. Clark was nice enough to come to this emergency meeting after a very trying day. I think we owe him a chance to respond. They say one bad apple spoils the bunch. Man: My son ain't no bad apple! Well, what about 300? Rotten to the core. Now, you're right, mrs. Barrett. This is a war. It's a war to save 2,700 other students, most of whom don't have the basic skills to pass the state exam. Now, if you want to help us, fine. Sit down with your kids and make them study. Go get your families off welfare. How dare you talk about welfare! Give our children some pride. Let them get their priorities straight. When dr. Napier came to me offering this job, i saw the lightning flash. All right! I heard the thunder roll! Give it to 'em! I felt breakers crashing, swamping my soul. We are not in church, mr. Clark! I fell down on my knees... and i cried, "my god... why has thou forsaken me?" Tell 'em about it. And the lord said, "joe, you're no damn good." No, no. I mean this... more than you realize. "You're no earthly good at all "unless you take this opportunity and do whatever you have to." And he didn't say, "joe, be polite." Do whatever you have to to transform and transmogrify this school into a special place, where the hearts and souls and minds of the young can rise, where they can grow tall and blossom out from under the shadows of the past, where the minds of the young are set free. That's right! And i gave my word to god. And that's why i threw those bastards out. And that's all i'm going to say. Mr. Clark, i wanted to talk to you about those kids you threw out yesterday. Well, what about them? I was one of them, but you made some kind of mistake. Mistake? Yes, sir. What's your name, son? Sams. Thomas sams. Thomas sams. You're a freshman? Yes, sir. Cutting class and smoking crack, mr. Sams. There's no mistake. No, sir. It wasn't me, sir. I swear it wasn't. It wasn't you? No. Do you think i'm stupid, son? No, sir. Yes, you do. You're trying to con a con man. You're not even learning anything on the streets, are you? You come with me. What are you doing? What's up here? Now, let me tell you something. The trouble with being a teenager is you don't know nothing. You think you're smarter than people who've already been down the road you're traveling. You know what i'm saying? Do you? Yes, sir. Did you tell your father i threw you out of school? Look at me, damn it! No, sir. Why not? No guts, huh? Afraid of what he'll say, aren't you? My father doesn't live with us anymore, sir. Is that what you're doing? Going around feeling sorry for yourself? Get out of here! You're wasting my time! Please let me back, sir. I have to get back at school. I can't tell my mama i got kicked out. Now, why should i let you back into my school? Because i'm going to do better, sir. How? By doing my work. What else? And staying out of trouble. What have you been thinking about all this time? Why should i believe you now? Because i changed my ways. I don't believe you, sams. I don't think you've changed a thing. Go on, jump! No. I don't want to jump. Yes, you do! You smoke crack, don't you? You smoke crack, don't you? Look at me, boy! Don't you smoke crack? Yes, sir. You know what that does to you, huh? No, sir. It kills brain cells, son. It kills brain cells. When you're destroying brain cells, you're killing yourself, only it's slower! If you want to kill yourself, don't fuck around with it! Do it expeditiously! Go on, jump! No. I don't want to kill myself, sir. You're sure? Yes, sir. I tell you what i'll do. I'll go back on my own word just this once and let you back into my school, 'cause you're still a baby, and you don't know shit. But you understand this, boy. You're not gonna get a moment's rest. I'm gonna be on your case every minute. You mess up just once, and you're out of here. You understand me? Do you understand me? Yes, sir. Now, go on back downstairs. All right, people. Let's settle down in here. Now, settle down, quiet down. Let those who are trying to eat their lunch digest. Robert, boy, you had lunch at fourth period. Go on. If mr. O'malley didn't do anything, mr. Clark won't. Louisa, you're looking mighty good today. Gonna have to tell these boys to watch out. You kids having any problems? Yeah. She is. Tell him. Louisa? Why do i have to take home ec? I want to take auto shop. I have brothers and sisters. My mother works. I've been cooking for 11 years. Does it look like i don't cook? I want you to take this to mr. O'malley. You know how much auto mechanics make? $17 an hour. Boy: That girl right there, man. Yo, sweetheart. Right here. I got hunger pains, baby. You could be my lunch. Boy, get off this table! Get your hormones together! It ain't hormones. She's fly, man. She's a fox. I just saw you with your arms around clarisse. You honked off with that skeezer? No, i never- check it out. It was only one time. Chill out, man! Richard, for your first job as class president, i want to build an atrium. Track me down tomorrow. We'll talk about it. Don't worry about it. How you doin', brother? Good to see you. Oh, you, hey! Yes, mr. Clark? What's your name? Kid ray. How you doin'? Nice suit. Just like you, mr. Clark. Got to look the part. These kids don't understand that. Hey! Sams, put it back! Put it back! How many times have i told you, boy? Put something in your head, not on it. Pull your pants up! Show some dignity! Have some sense! What's he doing hanging out with you seniors? You're providing a deleterious influence here. Mr. Clark, he's my cousin. We was just goin' over music. Music, huh? Come here. Let me have your attention. Everyone quiet down! I want all radios off instantaneously. All radios off. I want all of you to look at this... slovenly, sloppy boy here... as an example of how not to dress. Now, if you look like this when you look in your mirrors in the morning, find something else to put on. Self-respect permeates every aspect of your lives. If you don't have it for yourselves, you're not going to get it from anywhere. Now, to prove their self-respect, mr. Sams and his friends here- you boys stand up. I'm going to pound him. Mr. Sams and his friends are going to sing our school song. I want absolute silence. No one is permitted to move during the singing of the school song. All right. Let's hear it. Fair eastside by the road- mr. Darnell, no one is permitted to move during the song! I was picking up trash. Report to my office! Immediately! Woo! Quiet! Quiet in here! Ha ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha ha! All right. Continue. So cheer for...? You boys are on detention, 3 days each. You will learn this song, or next time, you'll be suspended. This goes for everybody! You will sing the school song upon demand, or you will suffer dire consequences! Mr. Wright, take this riffraff to my office. Hit the road, jack and don't you come back? No more, no more, no more, no more hit the road, jack and don't you come back no more what you say? O, o glorious is thy name o mighty lord glorious is thy name- people, what are you- can i help you, mr. Clark? Yes, you may. I want everyone to be able to sing the school song on demand or be suspended. Can you see to that? Certainly, mr. Clark. From the top- mrs. Elliott, may i see you in the hall, please? Now? Yes, now! Will you see if you can get these people together? Mm-hmm. If you sing like that in new york, we will not be invited back. I don't like being ignored. I'm sorry if you weren't getting enough attention, but i'm training a chorus. You don't think the school song is important enough to warrant a little interruption? It's fine, but we were doing mozart. We were in the middle of a difficult part. If you'd like us to respect your work, try to appreciate ours. Who do you think you're talking to? A man who seems threatened when any other adult does something the children like. Mrs. Powers, i want it quiet in here right now! I'd love to chat, mr. Clark, but i have a concert next week in new york, and i'd like to be prepared. What? Prepared-you know what that means- capable, ready, and up to your job. What concert? The one at lincoln center. We do it every year. Until now. Your concert is canceled. What? Cancelled! You know what canceled means, don't you? Over, finished, terminated! Why? They've worked too hard! For not telling me. Oh, i filed a form in your office! And for rank insubordination! You've questioned my judgment, intelligence! You're the one who comes around here to bother me. You're a despicable man! I've nothing to say to you. Let's accommodate that. You're fired! You need a psychiatrist! Get out! Right now! Fine! Fired? You'll hear from my lawyer! Mr. Clark. Ms. Levias, these miscreants don't know the school song. They've got 3 days' detention. Mr. Darnell, into my office. Fellas, come on up. What was that all about? I said no one move during the school song. If you can't understand that, find another job. I was picking up paper! You contradicted me in front of my students! They'remystudents! They are my students, mr. Darnell! Just what are you trying to prove? I'm working my ass off for you. I took the demotion. I'm doing my job! You're just getting your rocks off by treating me like trash. No, sir. That's what you were picking up. God damn it! You give me the goddamn respect you would want yourself, or i will kick your black ass! You are suspended, sir, as of right now! Get out! Ahh! Oh, my god! What is going on? Mr. Darnell is suspended. Indefinitely. You don't have the power to suspend a teacher! Then i can recommend. Get me the forms. Yes, sir. Please, mr. Darnell is more than a football coach. He teaches english! Not anymore. The state practice test is tomorrow. Why do this now? Ms. Levias- mr. Clark? What do you want? What? It could wait. Mr. Clark, do you have any idea of the chaos you have caused around here? Nobody knows what you're doing! That's exactly the way i like it! Never made first period for one year straight forget a diploma, it's education i hate i feel like droppin' my books and just strafin' it 'cause the way i'm feelin', i ain't makin' it i ain't makin' it school's the place i don't really want to be in the day i quit, that's it, i'm leavin' when people tell me about gettin' grades up my reply-"am i gettin' paid or what?" Bright in the morning, my alarm awakes me my mom won't, she's a witch, she hates me failin' all my classes, i don't give a damn success, i ain't makin' it stay to your right. Let's get to your classes. Come on, now. We got 20 seconds to the bell. Let's go. Sams, sams, come here. Where you going? Lunch. Try to eat some vegetables for a change, ok? Lay off those muffins. See you later. Don't bunch up down there, people. That doesn't concern you. We'll tell you about it later. All right, richard. It's all yours. We have two groups to thank- the black and hispanic alumnl- for giving us sofas and armchairs. It makes the school seem, as mr. Clark would say, a home away from home. Having fun? I am. I haven't heard a word about those test scores. They'll send them- send them how? By pony express? Am i supposed to wait for them? Get yourself down to trenton, where they're probably on some desk. Bring them back here where they can do some good. But now, ladies and gentlemen, for the grand finale- ms. Levias, if you would- our very own passaic river falls. Good job. You're doing very well, son. I'm very proud of you. Mr. Clark, come to the cafeteria quick! Some guy's beating up kid ray! Hey, stop it! Stop it! Come on, old man. I been waitin' for this. Come on. Come on. Get this disgrace to his race out of here! You already threw this disgrace out once. Then what's he doing back? Someone must have let him in from the inside. I want every door in this school chained and locked- all of them! Yes, sir. Hi, mr. Clark. Oh, hi, kids. How you doin'? Hi, mr. Clark. What's up? Hi, nathalee. Kaneesha, what's the matter, doll? Kaneesha? Now, i told you if you have any problems, you come and see me. Come on, now. I've known you more than half your life. What's the matter? How are your grades? They're not too good. Well, why not? You're a smart girl. You shouldn't be having any problems. I don't have no place to live. Well, where's your mother? She don't want me no more. Now, here. Come with me. Come on. I'll see what i can do about this. Ms. Levias, you know kaneesha carter here. You go on in to miss ruiz. Is he all right? He'll survive. Kaneesha here is having a problem at home. Pull her file, talk to her, get back to me. Come on, kaneesha. Because it never made a difference i never paid attention to the sound of my own despair trick or treat! There was never no feelin' never not needing that child even though i couldn't always be there and time don't wait on love, now life don't wait for a break in the weather what if i'm left with no love at all? No love at all? Who's there? Mrs. Carter? Mrs. Carter doesn't live here. Kaneesha: Mama, it's me. It's joan levias from eastside. I'm here with mr. Clark. 'Cause time don't wait on love, now and life don't send you an invitation been a long time, mrs. Carter. Please. Come in. No love at all i've been meaning to come by and talk to you. Mind if i try and act civilized for a moment? Offered you two a seat. Mrs. Carter, i ran into kaneesha in the halls. Was talking about her grades. She says you don't want her around anymore. I don't expect your sympathy, but i ruined my life. I know that's my business to deal with that. It's been hard enough. Joe: When kaneesha was in the fifth grade, you were one of my most active parents. You were always at school helping out. We don't mean to pry, mrs. Carter, but kaneesha has a gift. She has that spark. We have to look after her. Why would she think you wouldn't want her? I had kaneesha when i was 15. I didn't want no welfare, so i quit school, worked, came home at night, didn't have no life. So when she was old enough to take care of herself, i ran out and got one. Is that what you're doing now? I'm just now getting back on my feet, you know? As i get clean... i see myself for what i am... and i hate it. And i don't want her to see me like this no more. So when the people from the foster home came by, i thought it was the right thing to do. Why would i want to get rid of her? I love her... more than myself. Mrs. Carter... if we helped you find a job, a better place to live, would that help? Because, frankly, i don't see kaneesha making it without you. Do you understand? Yeah. Good. Thanks, bob. We'll talk tomorrow. What was that all about? Chains on the doors. Thought you people didn't like chains. You see this yet? You know, all of your shit comes down on my head. Oh, frank, look. This is- no. You let me talk. It's like you're a big bird with radar. I'm tired of getting hit. Is this my fault? This is nothing! I've got union lawyers threatening me. There's talk of a walkout. Let 'em! They're not teaching anything anyway! Then do something about it! Not one of 'em has a personal stake in that school! Not one! The fire chief says it's illegal to bar doors. Mrs. Barrett is organizing a parents group to remove you since you suggested that they get off welfare because quite a few of them need it. I wasn't talking to all of them, frank. Look, you came and recruited me, man. You disappoint me. The disappointment here is you! Me? Yes! You've known me 30 years. You know how i operate. Nigger, can you keep quiet? The fact is you're screwing up! You're alienating everybody! You have no life. Your wife left you. I ought to walk out myself! Go ahead, bail out! I said i'd back you up! That's what yousaid, frank! Brother, i'll go through the fire with you, but you are not taking care of business. But this shit you're pulling now, you've just gone plain loco! You suspend darnell! What the hell was that? Darnell is symptomatic of disciplinary- he is a good, strong, young black teacher! He dumped that desk on top of your head. Good for him. You will reinstate that man! You fire mrs. Elliott. Why? She didn't want to kiss your ass. I wouldn't either! Mrs. Elliott has an ego problem. Well, you lost the best teacher we had! I don't have time for mrs. Elliott's problem! You better make time! We're being crucified by a process that's turning blacks into a permanent underclass here! See? Nobody wants to talk about that! Mrs. Elliott's missionary zeal about mozart has nothing to do with our problem! What good will mozart do children who can't go out and get a job? Joe, your personal battles are going to cost us the war. Worry about the test scores. What the hell you think i'm worried about? End of discussion! Debate is over! You will write a formal apology for your treatment of mrs. Elliott and darnell and for your thoughtless insult to the women of this community! You will kowtow and step and fetch. Get used to it! It's the way of the world! If you're so hot on discipline, then start by accepting mine because contrary to popular opinion, i am the head nigger in charge! Come on. Let's get something to eat. Boy... you really think you bad, don't you? You're all in violation of the fire code! You cannot prevent me from going in. You're not getting in, and that's that. You have no right to lock these doors. This isn't a plant. This is my school. If you want to get in here, apply for a pass like everyone else. What the hell is the bat for? They used to call me crazy joe. Now they can call me batman. I got thugs and drug dealers trying to get into my school. You might be one. I don't know. Are you crazy? I got all day, chief. How much time do you have? I'll be back, clark. Thanks, mr. Darnell. Good to have you back. You shouldn't have fired me in the first place. You're right, but don't get used to it. Mr. Clark, why did you lock the school? Aren't you concerned about students' safety? Get these people back to their classes. Honey, get back to your class. You're playing into his hands. That was the fire chief. Know what he's saying right now? "Black bastard can't throw me out," know where he's saying it? Out in the parking lot. Mr. Clark, a baseball bat? If they'd got me those emergency doors that sound an alarm when you open them up like the ones white schools have, i wouldn't have to chain them. Those doors cost a fortune. We don't have enough money for books. Tell the mayor that. Call the federal government. Never mind what i'm doing. Why don't you do what i ask you? Where are those test scores i asked for? Hey, mr. Clark. Hi. Where you been? I was sick. Sick, huh? Hi, eric. What was that altercation about? Alteration? Are my pants too tight? The fight you had in the cafeteria. Don't get cute with me. I've already had enough shit from this. Why did he come after you? You dealing drugs? We don't need to get into this. I just came here to tell you something. I don't think i'm cut out for school. I just came to say good-bye. Dropping out on me, huh? I'm not dropping out. I'm moving on. You'll be dead in a year, son. You hear what i'm saying? You'll be dead in a year. Mr. Clark, i got to go. You know, baby, i look at you, and i want to do the hootchie cootchie. Hootchie cootchie, that's what i'm doing. You know, sometime, baby. Come on, fellas, not again. Sams, freeze. Where are you running off to? Why aren't you carrying a book? I got lunch then gym- why did i let you back in here? To get an education. How you gonna get an education if you don't read? I read. When do you get your report card? Next week. Miss james says i'm getting a "b." I knew you were smart. I knew it, too. See you later. Nice tie. Sams, get back here. Let's see what's in here. You don't want to go in there. It stinks. My, my, my. Aren't you my little songbirds from the cafeteria? Weren't they with you? Who, these guys? I'm sure you've learned the school song by now. You better know it because this time if you don't get it right, you're suspended for 10 days each. Is that clear? Yes, sir. All right, let me hear it. All right, fellas, let him hear it. Fair eastside fair eastsl-l-ide fair eastside by thy side we'll stand and always praise thy name praise thy name, praise thy name to heaven, yeah lend our hearts and hands to help increase thy fame ooh, lord the honor, yeah of old eastside high calls forth our loyalty loyalty, loyalty so cheer- all right, all right! Who taught you that? Answer me! I know you didn't do it yourselves. Sams! What? Who taught you this song? Speak up! Mrs. Powers. Mrs. Powers, eh? Come with me, all of you. ...out this world gonna shoulder up my cross gonna take it home to my jesus ain't that good news? I got a savior in that kingdom ain't that good news? I got a savior in that kingdom ain't that good news? No, no, no, people. You must remember, we need intonation, phonation, accuracy, and pitch. Now, this is your note. Hmm mrs. Powers. Yes, sir. These hoodlums told me something. Did you change the school song? Mrs. Powers- let her answer! The children thought the song was boring. Boring, huh? I have never heard a school song like that. I didn't authorize you to change it, did i? No, you didn't. I want everyone to learn that song in english and spanish. Immediately. Take a bow, mrs. Powers. You've rewritten our alma mater. The honor of old eastside high brings forth our loyalty loyalty, loyalty so cheer for dear old eastside... how's it going? What you got in there, malachi? My future. All right. ...aboard eastside all aboard, all aboard yes, eastside all aboard, all aboard how's it going, mr. Darnell? Good, good. That's great. ...high ge-e-et fellas? On that train train train ms. Levias... hi, mr. Clark. I just heard something you wouldn't believe. Uh, mr. Clark, mr. O'malley just brought this from trenton. The school's practice test. I had to wait all this time for this? Next time i order you to go get something, you better damn well go get it yourself! Oh, no. Oh, my god. Give me your attention, everyone. First three rows take 4 steps forward. Right now! Come on! 1, 2, 3, 4. Ok, that's good. Turn around. Hold it, mr. O'malley! What's your excuse? I was filling out a big stack of forms. I didn't know what time it was. This is a prime example of the kind of inefficiency and apathy that is destroying this school. Mr. O'malley, i can't believe you're that bad. I'll give you a chance to revitalize your image. Set up a student-peer tutoring program. Maybe the students can help themselves. Lord knows, you teachers aren't doing the job. Ms. Levias, i want remedial reading on saturdays. Volunteers will get regular pay. We can't afford overtime. Mr. Clark, the problem isn't our pay. What is the problem as you see it? How to get the students in on saturday. You hear that, people? How do we get the students in on saturdays for remedial reading? I'll tell you how. We'll go to their homes. We'll talk to their folks. If their folks can't read, they can come in, too. The only way we'll get anything done is to get everyone involved. And that goes for all of you! It's time to get involved. Everyone in this section, put both your hands above your heads. Raise your hands! Put them up! You people represent the 70% of our students who just failed the practice exam. 70%! But that is not their failure. I don't blame them. The failure is yours. That's right, yours. How many hours do you spend preparing your lesson plans? How often do you stay after school to give those children- the ones you know need it- the extra help that they require? Keep your hands up. Now you're getting a hint of the hopelessness and shame that makes those failing students throw up their hands at the thought of facing a world for which you have not prepared them. You're getting an inkling of the despair they feel when left to the mercy of the streets. Keep your hands up high. Look around at yourselves. Turn and look at yourselves! Because you are failing to educate them, this is the posture our students will wind up in, only they'll be staring down the barrel of a gun! Ooh, yeah, yeah ahh ha ha if a man is born in luxury it proves to me through history he is somebody if a man is born in poverty privation and misery he is nobody everybody is somebody nobody is nobody i mean, apart from all the wealthy ooh everybody is somebody oh, yeah so look at me here, man? Ooh ooh ooh oh, yeah ooh ooh ooh poverty is what, what it takes it makes such dangerous mistakes about who who is somebody when a woman has a child before that child is born she, she is somebody everybody is somebody nobody is nobody i mean, apart from all the wealthy doo doo doo doo doo everybody is somebody yeah, oh, yeah everybody is somebody all right, you guys, forget it. All right, i got one. Who's this? People, move to the right of the halls. Move expeditiously. Francesca, come over here. How are you? Fine, mr. Clark. How's your sister? She broke her leg. That's good. You have any problem, come to my office. Here's the key. Ooh, that ain't the key. Sams, sams. Where's sams? Anybody see sams? Pull your pants up, son. Clarence, come here. Get your hormones under control, boy. Let me feel your butt. Joe: Clarence. What do you think you're doing? I was just... i was just, um... francesca, come here. What is he doing? Can he do me? Does he have the juice? No way, mr. Clark. Clarence, report to my office. Mr. Clark, i was just fooling around. Got you. How do you learn the alphabet ? be on time come on, sams! You can do it. ...he's on time j-o-e c-l-a... don't give up! Fall in together, going "how do you like the weather?" Going "how do you learn the alphabet?" Be on time school bell ring at a quarter to 9:00 that's it, sams! Stay with it, boy! ...be on time "how do you learn the alphabet?" be on time how do you spell eastside , eastside high? How do you spell joe clark? He's on time j-o-e c-l... holy cow! I'm out of here. Clark can't even get them past that test. I thought we'd settled this. With the doors chained, that school's a firetrap. He's laughing at us. The man has a legitimate problem. How does he keep drug pushers out of his school if their buddies can let them walk on in? He's got a point. This doesn't concern you. Don, we can both go to jail. By statute, we are legally responsible. If a fire broke out and a kid got hurt, they're going to get trampled. A bunch of savages anyway. Savages? Don, can't you control your men? Ladies and gentlemen, please leave me alone with mrs. Barrett. Don, i want to talk to you. I'll call you later at your office. Thank you, frank. Close the door, eh? I want to apologize for the chief's use of language. I don't like none of you people. Then let's cut through the formalities. What do you want? Clark! Just like that. Head on a platter. You think i got an attitude. Let me tell you what i think. You like clark because he's a guard dog, does your dirty work, keeps the black folk in line. That's fine, but you got to get re-elected. I got enough folks lined up with me to give you a damn hard time, and i'll get more. Unless i do what? Appoint me to the school board so we can vote clark out. Otherwise we'll have to vote you out. It's always a pleasure to see citizens avail themselves of the democratic process. My job will be easy. You're not too popular these days, are you? I'll sic the fire chief on clark. Will that satisfy you? Yes. And then i'll get the school board to dismiss him. Then you'll come out publicly for me. It'll be my pleasure, mr. Mayor. That barrett is a bitch on wheels. Smart. She's smart. Yeah. She got your number. When am i supposed to do this? Now we'd just disrupt things. Give him another week to prepare for that test. Then we'll catch him with chains on the doors. We nail him, and we make her happy. Politics. What a business. It's just like yours, putting out fires. The mayor's going to nail me, huh? What do i always say? He's got the hammer and nails himself. These are some of my white students. Frankie, bernard, steve. Boys, this is mr. Rosenberg, school attorney. Let him hear the school song. Fair eastside by thy side by thy side? We'll stand we'll stand? And always praise thy name- all right! I can't stand this. Needs work, fellas. Some things you can't teach. Bad singing isn't genetic. How's your mother? She got that job. She's feeling good. Girls, what are you doing? The phone's broken. My baby's sick. Make your call from the office. When will you girls learn? I ain't ashamed about my baby. Nobody's saying you should be ashamed. And she ain't ashamed of me. Whenever she look at me, she don't see no wrong. Ok. Go on and make your call. Mr. Vanzetti, let these girls make a call. Hey, mr. Clark. We can't let them know who told you. Why not? Mr. Clark, we got a problem. How come you leave us out? Everything's for the black kids. The gospel chorus, football, basketball is for the blacks. I'm short. I can't play basketball. The point is, you're ignoring us. We're getting really ticked off. With a mouth like yours, you ought to study law. Really? You kids wait for me in my office. If you all talk at once, i can't do anything. I'll be with you ladies in a minute. Boss, you and mr. Rosenberg better wait out here. Miss lynn, give markus a pass. Ms. Levias, is everyone here? Yes, sir. Let me have your attention. With the help of my ubiquitous, clandestine informants i have learned that the mayor has told the fire chief to catch me with chains on the doors. They want to prosecute me and get me out of here. The security guards are our first line of defense. If you see the fire chief, stop him at the gates. Call in code 10 on your walkie-talkies. We will repeat code 10 on the p.a. System. All teachers and guards have keys to the exit doors. When you hear code 10, proceed to your assigned door and remove the chains. Guards, resume your posts. Ms. Levias, take over. Tell those kids in my office to meet me here 7th period. How did it go? It's under control. I have the progress report on the reading program. I thought you'd like to hear it. I would like to hear it. I'd also like to hear the kids in my office, and mr. Rosenberg, and dr. Napier. I can't be 10 different places at the same time. Maybe my vice principal can do something without me for once. Mr. Clark. I'll help you 7th period. Excuse me. Good night, mr. Clark. Good night. Mr. Clark. Yes, ms. Levias. May i talk to you for a minute, please? What do you want? I want you to transfer me. To where? Out of here. This doesn't surprise me. I've sensed resistance in you since our very first meeting. You're an egomaniacal windbag. Who you talking to? You! You like to whip people who can't fight back. I thought i could take it because i had a father in the same kind of pain that makes you such a bastard, but i was wrong. Life is much too short. I will not endure you any longer. The only reason i haven't walked out and half the staff with me is because those children need us. You're so busy talking discipline, you forget to educate. What the hell do you think i've been doing here? You cleaned it up. That was easy. Those children want to be helped. They've done everything we've asked, but i feel sorry for them. They're not ready to take that test. What the hell are you talking about? I have done everything- i. It is always i. There are 300 teachers here. You don't do it alone. I don't have to listen to these accusations. Youwilllisten! All right, ms. Levias, go ahead and talk. You've been flapping your mouth, and you haven't heard a thing. You haven't seen what's painfully obvious. I'll tell you what- no, let me finish! Everybody here may not like you, but we all applaud your effort. What you don't understand is the same people who support you are the ones you're beating up! You don't even say thank you. You just constantly abuse them, criticize them. What the hell do you want from me? I want you to get this straight. Most of the teachers are here because they care about those children, this school, this fight. They're in it with you. They take it home the same as you. They are part of those children's lives. You are thoughtless and cruel, and it hurts. And none of them deserve it. They are sick of it, and so am i. Ms. Levias. What's this? The transfer you asked for. All right, people. Here we are. This is the day. In one hour, you're going to take an exam administered by the state to test your basic skills and the quality of education at eastside high. And i want to tell you what the people out there are saying about you and what they think about your chances. They say you are inferior. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! "You are just a bunch of niggers and spics and poor white trash." "Education is wasted on you." "You cannot learn!" You're lost! I mean all of you. I want all the white students to stand up. All my white students, stand up. Come on. Stand up. Stand up. That's it. Come on, stand up. These are my white children, and they're the same as all of you. They've got no place to go. Otherwise, they would have abandoned us a long time ago, but they couldn't. So here they are at eastside, just like the rest of us. You can sit down. Are you getting my point, people? Yes! Is it sinking in? Yes! We sink, we swim. We rise, we fall. We meet our fate together! Now, it took the help of a good, good friend to make me know and understand that, and i do understand it, and i'm grateful. I'm eternally grateful. And i've got a message for those people out there who've abandoned you and written you off. Can you hear me? Yes! Can you hear me? Yes! Good! You are not inferior! Your grades may be. Your school may have been. But you can turn that around and make liars out of those bastards in exactly one hour! You'll take that test, pass it, and win! So here's what i want you to do. When you find your minds wandering, i want you to knuckle back down and concentrate. Concentrate! Remember what's at stake and show them what eastside high is all about- a spirit that will not die! Sometimes in our lives we all have pain we all have sorrow but if we are wise we know that there's always tomorrow lean on me when you're not strong and i'll be your friend? I'll help you carry on for it won't be long till i'm gonna need somebody to lean on you just call on me, brother when you need a hand we all need somebody to lean on i just might have a problem? That you'll understand we all need somebody to lean on why don't you lean on me? Lean on me if you need a friend you can lean on me i'll be your friend lean on me you can lean on me come on and lean on me lean on me you can lean on me please, won't you swallow your pride? If i have things you need to borrow for no one can fill those of your needs that you won't let go why don't you just lean on? Anytime lean on come on and lean on lean on me, you can lean on me if you need a friend lean on me you can lean on me and if you got a problem you can lean on me i'm your problem solver? You can lean on me why don't you lean? Lean on me uh-huh come on and lean on me you can lean on me call on me, brother you can lean on me sister, give me your hand lean on me, you can lean on me you can, you can, you can lean on me, you can lean on me swallow up your pride lean on me, you can lean on... please, children, people lean on me, oh eastside! Eastside! Eastside! Eastside! Eastside! Eastside! Eastside! Eastside! Eastside! Eastside! Eastside! Eastside! Eastside... dum dum-dum-dum-dum dum-dum-dum-dum dum-dum-dum dum-dum dum-dum sometimes in our lives we all have pain we all have sorrow dum-dum-dum but if we are wise we know that there's always tomorrow i told you these things take time. Just how long am i supposed to wait? You boys are messing with the wrong female. He won't let me in. What's going on? Would you talk to her? I thought we had made a deal. Don't broadcast it all over town. I have got a school board meeting tonight and enough votes to get clark kicked out if i can prove he's chained those doors. We can get that if you move on him today. Chief gaines already tried that. Bullshit! I've made promises of my own. I've got people with me right now. If i can't deliver- just a minute. And i do not issue idle threats. Then don't, because i don't want to hear it. Ok, chief. Mrs. Barrett was promised some action. I think it's time we get a court order and get you past those guards. Sounds good to me. He ain't worth it. Jerk. That's right. He's a jerk. I told you that. You don't listen to me. What are you two ladies doing in here? Lillian, aren't you supposed to be in class? Huh? Kaneesha? What's going on here? Lillian? What is this? You'll have to ask her. Kaneesha, what's the matter? I got pregnant. Please don't be mad at me. Let me talk to her alone. Did you tell your mother? I can't. Reggie's the father? He says it's not his, but i know it is. I've never been with no other boys. I never meant for this to happen. You girls never do. So many of you bringing babies into this world just to prove you can accomplish something. And you're doing so well now, kaneesha. There are other alternatives. I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll have your mother come to the school. We'll put our heads together. I'm sure we'll be able to help you decide what's best for you to do. Trust me? Mr. Clark! 8:00 a.m. I'll call your mother. What is it? The fire chief. He got past the gate. Code 10! Get those chains off the door! The enemy's here! We got it locked, mr. Clark. Mr. Clark, you're under arrest. For what? Basically for being an asshole. Specifically for conspiracy to violate of the fire code. I got no problem with the fire code. The only problem here is you. And your problem is your mouth. Joe: Get those chains off the doors! The enemy's here! Guard: We got it locked, mr. Clark. Cuff him! Hey, mr. Clark! What's this all about? It's about someone finally standing up to this man instead of taking his orders like a maid. How dare you speak like that! Mrs. Barrett- shut up! You're finished! The school board will hear this at 7:00, and we'll vote your black ass out. Yo, bitch, vote on this! You go to class! You're acting principal now. I expect you to perform as i would. What- what's going on? What did you do? I chained the doors. You break the law, you pay the price. We still got to go to class? Yes. All of you, get back to class! Now! Mr. Clark... go on! Who will look after the school? Go on! Get back to class! Get back in there, all of you! Go on! Ms. Levias, they're your responsibility! I guess we ought to be getting out of here, joe. That school board meeting's about to begin. Do whatever we can. Have you thought about a new line of work? Perhaps an exciting career in electronics? It's just a little joke. I'm going. I've got no complaints, joe. As far as i'm concerned, what you accomplished down at that school was a goddamn miracle. Those kids have a light in their eyes now that was never, never there before. Thanks, boss. You know, i'm always trying to teach my kids to stay out of jail. Look at me. You go on. Do what you got to do. He has failed at his professional task. We brought him in to save our school from a takeover from the state. That was the mandate from our mayor. But the test scores on the practice exam were 35% below passing. Now, maybe if we dump him now and get a new principal ourselves- show the state that we're doing something- we can pre-empt the takeover, but only if we get him out before those final test scores come back. After that, it'll be too late. This board won't have any power. It'll be nothing but a rubber stamp. Mrs. Arthur, those are the facts. I appreciate your personal loyalty to mr. Clark, but he has let our children down, and our loyalty should be to them. Our loyalty should be to the man we hired. Order! Order! Free mr. Clark! Free mr. Clark! Free mr. Clark! Napier: Order, ladies and gentlemen! Order, please! We cannot continue this meeting with this kind of chaos! Please! Sit down! Come to order! Dr. Napier, dr. Napier, i think you should call the question now. I cannot call the question. All points of view seem to have been exhausted here. No further purpose will be served by this. Why don't you have someone on the board- mr. Clark's students have assembled outside in an exercise of their first amendment rights. How many? It looks like all of them. Free mr. Clark! Free mr. Clark! We're in a tough spot here. I have to ask your help, joe. It's not for me. It's for those kids. They're very emotional. They're all jacked up. You have to send them home. I don't have to do nothing but stay black and die. For crying out loud. Free mr. Clark! Free mr. Clark! Free mr. Clark! Free mr. Clark! Free mr. Clark! People, before this gets out of hand, listen, for your own safety, listen to me! Free mr. Clark! Free mr. Clark! All right, joe. Let me put it this way. First, i wanted you to succeed. Now, don't think that i ever wanted anything else. But you're a realist, joe, just like me. Think what would happen if there was a riot and cops had to clear that square. I'd have law and order on my side, and the only people who'd be hurt would be your kids. Free mr. Clark! Free mr. Clark! Free mr. Clark! Free mr. Clark! Free mr. Clark! Listen to me! People, please! You must all disperse and return to your homes! Your presence here is helping no one. Why don't you use your brains and listen? Free mr. Clark! Thank you. Listen up. Settle down. Give her a chance to talk. She might actually have something to say. Chill. Settle down. Let's listen to the old loudmouthed wench. Here you go, barrett. Here you go. You can call me what you want, but the simple fact is mr. Clark has broken the laws of this state and exposed you all to grave danger. His behavior is irresponsible. Chaining those doors was a criminal act. Why do you think they call him "crazy joe"? Because you don't understand him. Yeah. That's right. He chained those doors to keep out the drug dealers. You're twisting the law. The laws are made to protect the people. That's what he's doing for us. Yes! The thing that you don't understand is that mr. Clark believes in us. He doesn't believe in you! You don't take care of your responsibility! Despite what he himself may believe, mr. Clark is not eastside high! Mr. Clark is not only eastside high. Mr. Clark is like a father, the only father some of us know. You don't know a thing about mr. Clark! People! People, just hear me! The school board is meeting right now, and we will give you what eastside high deserves- a good principal. We don't want a good principal! We want mr. Clark! You may think you know what you want, but the question is what is best for you, for eastside high. This thing's getting out of hand. Talk to them, please. ...to see that this gets resolved so that you can continue your education. Free mr. Clark! People! People... yay! All right! I wonder why i can't get this kind of turnout for study hall. All right, now. Kids, this is all very nice, but now i'm going to insist that you all go home and let the laws of the land prevail. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Now, listen. Listen. If i've taught you anything, i have tried to give you respect for the law. Now, i want you all to go home in an orderly fashion! No! No! No! Your voices have been heard! No! No! No! I appreciate your concern for me. No! No! No! But now is the time to go home. No! No! No! Kids, listen. You're not helping the matters any. You're not helping our cause if you stay here. No! No! No! I thought i left you in charge of these students. You got to read this. Is this taking care of your responsibility? Read it! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Boss. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Dr. Napier, it is my duty- it is my privilege and my honor to report to you that the students of eastside high have passed the minimum basic skills test! Mr. Mayor. Boy: Yeah! All right! Go get him! Mr. Mayor, on behalf of myself and on behalf of the students of eastside high, you can tell the state to go to hell. I told you. You should not have brought him here... joe louis clark is not going anywhere. Are you ready, my ghosts? Yes! Let me hear it. 1, 2, 3! Fair eastside by thy side we'll stand?
