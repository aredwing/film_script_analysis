Lay off me, beautiful, I almost got this baby wired. Yeah... it's gonna be... dynamite. Whoa! Hey, my TV flipped out. I missed the new Noodles video. Earth Station Putterman is at it again. Oh, Daddy. - ... but I think it's okay. - I think this thing is a piece of- He's such a dork. He thinks he's a genius, what can you do? Oh, I'll get it. And one and two. Hi, Gramps! Hey, honeybee. You know the one about the U-2s? - Uh, the band? - No, the spy planes. Oh, yeah, I think I saw 'em on MTV. MTV? Phooey! Je-sus! What's with this thing, Norton, I'm gettin' electrocuted here? I tried to warn you, Mr. P. These do-it-yourself 100s are kinda temperamental. Yeah, gimme a break guy, I need a hand here. Sorry, Mr. Putterman, no can do. The warranty covers repairs only. You insisted on the 100, Mr. P. I told you they were trouble. Yeah? Well, when I get through with her, she's gonna be the hottest dish in town. ...four, five, six, seven, eight. one, two three... Hi Dad, how was downtown today? Downtown, phooey! I'm sick a downtown. Used to be the place to go, talk to people, disseminate your literature- feel like you were doin' some good in the world. Now it's just bums and weirdos and kooks coming out of the woodwork. Getting so decent folks won't even stop and talk. Oh, Daddy, don't be so paranoid. Hey, soldier, got that radar up yet? It's not radar, pop. It's a satellite dish, you know a TV receiver. Satellite, you say? I wonder if it could pick up recon satellites? Keep track of enemy troop movements. It might be a handy little addition to my home defense unit. Holy tomato. Ahh! Brain shot! Belly down, soldier, the geeks aren't through with you yet! Bam! Bam! Bam! Hey, hey, hey, would you guys grow up? - Hi, Dad. - Hey, Sherm. I gotcha, Grampa. Captured your radar too. Hell of an assault, soldier! Damn fine show of fire power. Say, Mr. P, you mind if I grab another Heinie? Look, Norton, if you're gonna hang out and guzzle my Heinies, the least you could do is give me a hand here. Sorry, Mr. P., the contract says repairs only. You want repairs? - I'll show you repairs! - Mr. Putterman. There! Now let's talk repairs! Je-sus! What the hell was that? Man, I've never seen anything like that before. Stanley, what is going on? What the heck was that noise? Where's my workout show? Hey-hey, Mr. Putterman, check it out. All right, Putterman. What a guy. Get ready, you guys. This baby is going to open a whole new dimension in television pleasure. - Oh, boy. - Oh, Stanley, I'm so excited. Check it out! Dyno-picture. Hey, nice one, Dad. Oh, trs impressimo. Pleasure palace, here we come. Troop movements, leave it here. No way! Channel 69, Pop. Stanley! This is grungy! Where's MTV? MTV? No problem. I'm a liar and I'm a cheat  Leave it, leave it, I love this song! Echh! He is so nasty. Intellectual decay! Turn it off, it'll rot your brain cells. It's the international conspiracy! Hey, hey, hey, careful, you're gonna break it. You're gonna break it, careful, watch it! What the hell? Gosh, that coulda burned down the whole house! Stanley, you call Norton right this second! No, no, no, look. It's fine, it's workin' fine, it's cool. Oh boy, Medusa. Hello, bloodsuckers. Ready to be turned to stone? Will you look at those hooters? Holy tomato! Let's watch her tonight, okay, Grampa? All the way to midnight. Hell yeah, we'll watch her. What about brain rot, Dad? The intellectual conspiracy? I've said it before and I'll say it again, war stories and monster movies are educational. They're survival oriented. They always neutralize the enemy in the end. I'll get it, it's OD. O who? OD, my new boyfriend. Oh, Irish boy? New boyfriend, what happened to the Weinstein boy? Squidsville, Mommy, gaa! OD's the coolest boy in school, he's a musical genius. Okay, invite him in and let's see what he looks like. OD! Da-da-da-da-da-da, charge! Ya gotta come in. My parents wanna meet you. Oh, wow, what a drag. Ta-da.  Everybody, this is OD. Hello, Mr. Putterman, I'm glad we're finally gettin' a chance to meet. Hello, Mrs. Putterman, mm-mm, beautiful outfit. Why thank you, OD. You're sweet. Mom, can we use the Jacuzzi tonight? Uh, not tonight, baby. Your father and I might be swinging. Stanley, we have to meet them at the Cha-Cha Room at eight. Oh, I gotta hit that ol' locker room pronto. Nice meeting you, OD. Don't stay out too late. Oh, no, we won't. Well, it was nice meeting you, sir. Hey, no problem... dude. Just take care of my little girl. Okay. - Yeah. - What dress you wearin', babe? - Oh, my new Naugahyde. - Oww! - Woo! - Killer! I'll just get my junk and I'll be right back, okay? No sweat. Hey, old dude, whatcha eatin', man? Lizard tail jerky. Wanna stick? No thanks, man, I just pigged out. Amazing creature, the lizard. Ya eat the tail, it don't give a hoot. Just grows another one. And ya eat it too. It's mighty darn tasty. Hey, little dude, you into metal? Kiss the boot, man. Kiss the ass, bozo. Jesus, could you believe that kid? Oh, I thought he was kinda cute. That punk stuff is just a phase anyway. Yeah, I know, but don't they know how ridiculous they look? Puny, puny earthlings, I, Ro-Man, am your new master. Worship my superior intelligence or I shall wipe you from the face of the planet. Uh, give us a break, Ro-Man. Lose the deep-sea helmet, guy, and quit monkeying around. Medusa's been getting a lot of fan mail lately. Hey, listen, I called that TV guy, Norton. He's gonna come by a little later and check out the dish. If it starts acting up again, just turn it off until he gets here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, go on, go on, get outta here. ...words from our sponsors. Announcing Super Television, with a picture so lifelike, it comes right out into your living room. Pretty good old movie, ain't it? No. Let's see what's up with the recon satellites. ...superior, the winning television you- Careful, Grampa! What the Sam Hill? Watch out, Grampa, you're gonna break it again! Hey, this looks like a cool movie. Hey, he's a gross lookin' booger, ain't he? I'd nuke that sucker! Well, do something, you ugly bastard! Man, this is the dumbest movie I ever saw. What a bunch a crud. All you phone freaks out there stay tuned. Oh, boy! We're gonna open up the call lines to see what you perverts are up to. And Medusa wants to hear wants to hear some real... kinky... nightmares. Hmm? Great balls of fire! Did you see somethin', boy? You know what the Sam Hill it was? It-it looked like a- a monster. There's no such thing as monsters, boy! It was a God dang burglar! Let's move out! It looked... weird. Sometimes them burglars wear Hallyween masks. They scare the poop outta ya. You get the jackets, I'll break out the fire power. Survival ranger's first priority is defend the home unit. - You got that, boy? - Yes, sir! Remember what I taught you about the 30-round magazine, boy? I remember, Grampa. All right, boy, let's go! Come on, Mr. Putterman. I don't have all night here. Remember boy, best way to stop the enemy- brain shot! What a tool job. Stan, the man. Put, the putz. Can't even get a Heinie for the road. Did you hear that? I'll be a God danged son of a gun! They're stealin' the radar. What the hey? Stay right where you are! Hey, guys? It's me, Norton. Remember, Norton, the satellite guy. What the heck are you doin' out here? Hey, no problem, sir. Uh, Mr. Putterman called me to come check out the dish. I rang the front bell, but nobody was home. We thought we saw a burglar. Did you see anyone? No, not me, guy. You wouldn't by any chance have one a them Hallyween masks in there, would ya? Uh, listen, old fella, I'm just here to check out the dish. So, if you don't mind, I'll get back to work. All right, boy, let's go recon the house. Mmm. Damn, I hate these do-it-yourself 100s. I'll scout the den, you stay put. - Keep the front door covered. - I'm goin' with you. Stay put, soldier, remember your chain of command. Yes, sir. Grampa? You okay? A- OK, little buddy. God amighty, Mr. Putterman, this is disgusting. Gotta keep these electronics clean, nut! Grampa, did ya hear that? Say what, little buddy? A scream. Something weird. I'll be right there, soldier. Grampa! Grampa! Operator. Hello, I need the police. Police department, Officer Nutky speaking. Hello, police? Who's calling, please? My grampa, I mean a monster. I mean the TV. I mean- Sherman Putterman. Now, Sherman, are you aware that what you're doing is a criminal offense? Huh? There's a law against prank phone calls. No, really, I swear there's a monster on TV. It ate Grampa and the TV guy. Now listen here, Sherman Putterman, I'd come out and arrest your ass, but lucky for you I've got some real police emergencies to attend to. No, please, wait! Ha-ha. Hey, let's go! - Come on babe, ha-ha. - Come on, come on. Voila. Chez Putterman. Otherwise known as the Pleasure Zone. Wow, you really got a sensuous-type place here. So regal, so magnificent, and so isolated from the city. That's what we love about it. Yeah, it's kind of a nature trip. Puts you in touch with the, uh, real you. The cities are so nasty these days. Don't you think? Absolutely- the cesspools of civilization. We much prefer to live on the yacht. Yeah. Uh, say, babe, you know, I think I better check on Norton. See how he's doin' with that satellite dish. Excuse me. Oh, is he gonna be joining us? - Sherman! - Mom. Grampa... a monster! For Chrissake, he's having another one of his attacks. Sherman, wake up Sherman, you're dreaming. No, really, it's in the TV! Um, Stanley, why don't you show Spiro and Cherry around. I'll just be a minute. Good idea. Maybe we should leave. Oh, no, no, don't you dare, no, he just needs a pill. Now, go on, go on, have fun. Please. What are you doing out of bed, Sherman Putterman! The Pleasure Den. Wow, this place is like, really... awesome! - Art collectors, eh? - Oh, hell, yeah. Listen, I know a place where you can get all this stuff real cheap. All right, Norton! Hey, Norton! Looking good, guy! Norton? Hey, uh, listen, I'd invite you in for a beer or somethin', but we got company now, so take off, okay? I'll check with ya later. 'Preciate it, babe. He's a cool guy. Service seven days a week. Handles only the best. But hey... on to the Pleasure Dome. To the Pleasure Dome. - Mom, please listen to me! - Sherman Putterman, I'm gonna slap you silly! Why do you have to pull this when we have company? Who left the TV on? No, Mom, there's a monster. Sherman, you're not gonna make me call Dr. Silverman, are you? Mom, look. Sherman, what have you done? That's where Grampa was. Uchh! What a mess! It killed him and the TV guy. Honestly, I cannot leave you two alone an hour without some kind of disaster! Ta-da.  The Pleasure Dome. Wow, now, this is what I call romantic. Magnificent architecture- Greek influenced? Roman, guy, Roman all the way. Hey, check it out- I got this baby wired. State of the art. This satellite receiver pulls in the weirdest stuff from all over the world. Hey, what is this movie? Huh? What is- what is this movie? I think I read for a part in it one time. Bunch a creeps! People of Earth, you must heed my warning. Destroy your satellite receivers. - Great sound, huh? - Dismantle your communication systems. Render your television sets inoperable for the next It may already be too late. Uh, I don't know, it looks kinda like that Japanese thing- uh, you know, whatchamacallit- you know, where the Martians steal all the Earth women and knock 'em up. Yeah, you know, to- to repopulate Mars. - Ahh! - Hey, that sounds kinky. Is that hard core? Fantastic idea for a movie- Martians diddling the women of the universe. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it, Spiro- intergalactic swingers. Dad? Are you decent? Hold your God dang horses, I'm changing in here! See? It was all a dream! No, Grampa's dead! Oh, Sherman! Home so soon? I'm just takin' care of business here. Everything okay, Dad? Okay? Yeah, I guess so. Everything A-OK with you? There's a big mess in the den, Dad. Do you know anything about it? Mess? I don't know anything about a mess, dear. It musta been Sherman. I'm just takin' care of business. Get to bed, young man! We will talk about this in the morning! No, Mom, really! Something weird's going on, I swear! Sherman Putterman, I am fed up! If you're too big of a sissy to spend the night alone, then you'll just spend the night with Grampa! - No, Mom, no, Mom! - Get in there! Get in! Dad, is it all right if Sherman spends the night with you? Mom, please let me out! Come on, Mom. Please, I swear I'll be good, Mom. Just let me out, please Mom. I won't mention the monster, Mom. Let me out, please, I swear I'll be good! Pleasant dreams, you two. - Come on, Mom, please? - Good night. I swear I'll be good! Grampa? Grampa, where are you? Grampa, are you planning a surprise attack? Grampa? I hear you, Grampa. Come outta there. Or I'll open up on ya. - There. - Hey, babe. - Ah, Raquel. - That didn't take long, did it? I didn't miss anything... exciting? Oh, Stanley was just showing us the wonders of satellite TV. He's a real video pilot, eh? I just really love your house here. It's so- I don't know, it's kinda- kinda weird. Yeah, thank you. We did it ourselves. Hey, babe, is everything cool with Sherm? He's in with Dad, doin' terrific. You know, you really got a cute kid there. Have you ever thought about putting him in the movies? I mean, I know a really sweet agent. Oh, God no. Sherman's much too neurotic to be an actor. Yeah, the only thing the kid is interested in is being a soldier. Oh, such a manly pursuit- raping and pillaging, creating life and taking it away, like the Gods of the ancient Greeks. Well, hey, guy, I mean, I'm a lover not a fighter. Comprende? Uh, Spiro, why don't you come help me make the drinks? Excellent idea. I make a wonderful margarita. Very unusual. Go for it! Raquel, do you have ouzo? Uh, no, I don't even know what it is. Too bad, I make a delicious ouzo margarita. So, uh... here we are. Yeah. Is it cool if I get in there? Cool? Babe, it's a perfect 98.6. It's like floatin' in your mother's womb. Cool? Hey, go for it. That's what it's there for. Okay. Holy tomatoes. Oh, it tickles. - Are you coming? - Yeah. I just gotta change my clothes. Eh, look, whatever you do, don't touch this. There's something screwy with the waterproofing and uh, well, I wouldn't want you to get electrocuted. Me neither. Hurry back? In a flash. Oh, man that bikini is dynamite. What are you looking at, you creep? So, tell me, Raquel, how long have you and Stanley been swinging? Well, to tell you the truth, we've only tried it a couple a times. It's so hard to meet nice people through the classifieds. Oh, I know exactly what you mean. One never knows what one is getting into. But you and Cherry, you're so sweet- regular folk. Stanley's such a fascinating fellow. A real renaissance man. Definitely. He's got a really high IQ. People of Earth, please heed my warning. A terrible accident has occurred. I am Pluthar, sanitation captain of the planet Pluton. A stray energy beam containing garbage from my substation may be headed for your solar system and could possibly result in the total annihilation of your species. I'm so terribly sorry for the inconvenience. I went to my hair dresser today to have my hair ratted. You like? Oh, it's really something to see. We use live rats, you know. Snakes just eat 'em up. Mm-mm, mm-mm. Whatta you know? It's time for all you phone freaks out there to give us a call. Share your darkest hearts. Meanwhile, back to Attack... of the something or other. Me, here, who's there? Is- is this Medusa? Well, who's it sound like, kid, Count Dracula? What's your name, I said. Well, this is Sherman. And I have this problem and nobody believes me. Oh, well, maybe I won't believe you either. Let's hear it. Grampa and me, we were sleeping. And then we woke up, and there was this monster. And Grampa thought it was a burglar. And then we saw the TV guy. And then Grampa disappeared and the monster went inside the TV. Then Mom came home and locked me in the bomb shelter. So, tell me, Sherman, currently under psychiatric care? No, really! Sorry, Sherman, time's up. Sherman? Come here, Sherman. Come real close to Medusa. All set, Sherman? This one's for you, babe. Pleasant dreams, kiddies. So, tell me, Raquel, is Stanley a manly man? Oh, God, yes. A real stallion. No, what I mean is, does Stanley take it like a man? Oh, yeah. I guess so. I thought so. And what about you, Spiro? Are you a real manly man? Oh, yes, indeed. Spiro Xeros is the manliest of men. Spiro... do you think that maybe I could have a little sneak preview? Mmm? Hey, Raquel, has there been some misunderstanding? Whatta ya mean? Well, I'm Greek, you know? Oh, of course, you're Greek. It said so in the classifieds. Oh, don't worry, we're not prejudice. No, no, no, you don't understand. I am into Greek. Greek culture. I like boys. Stanley is such a manly man. Oh, my God, Stanley's never gonna believe this. Spiro, how's my main man? Ahh, Stanley, how marvelous you look. - An old family recipe. - Oh. Whoa, whatta ya got in here, Spiro? Rocket fuel? Gettin' ready to, uh, blast off? Stanley, uh- Spiro, why don't you take Cherry her drink? We'll join you in a few seconds. Excellent idea. See you soon, eh, tiger? You bet, guy. Yassoo! - Down the hatch. - Yeah, mud in your eye. So, uh, whatta ya think? You like 'em? Uh, well, now, look, they're very nice. - But- - Yeah, yeah, lookin' good too, huh? Are we gonna swing or what? Ahh, you look so serene, my darling. Like Cleopatra on the Nile. That Stanley- hot stuff, huh? Oh. A little warm, don't you think? Ahh! Yechh, what is this, algae? Ahh, maybe it's a sex lubricant, huh? You are so beautiful. How 'bout a quickie, huh? A little aperitif, eh? Just a quick little suck, eh? Well, just gonna have to straighten out old Spiro about the facts a life. Now, Stanley, don't get belligerent. Yeah, yeah, yes. Stanley. Listen, Spiro, we gotta work something out, pal. Where are they? Spiro? Cherry? What the hell did that homo do to the Jacooz? Maybe Spiro's cocktail made someone sicky-poo. - Stanley? - Yeah! Stanley, it looks like something's in there. No, I hope they didn't electrocute themselv- Wait a minute. What is that? No, no, no. Mom! Dad! Police department, Officer Nutky speaking. Hello, this is Sherman again. There's really a monster, it's eating Mom and Dad. Please, help me! I warned you about this, son. You are in a helluva heap a trouble. Screw you! Remember what I told you about explosives, boy- blow your dang balls off! Where's the party? Oh! Did you feel something? Yeah, like 3.5 on the Richter scale. Army dude, what are you doin' up this late? Sherman, are Mom and Dad home yet? Sis, stay here. Somethin' weird's goin' on. Sherman? What are you doing? There's a monster loose. It ate Grampa. I think it just ate Mom and Dad. Honestly, Sherman, sometimes you are such a nerd! Sis, don't go in there. Sherman, stop it! Yeah, buzz off, dude, I wanna party. Are Mom and Dad home yet? They were here, some other people too. The monster got 'em. Sherman, will you shut up about the monster? I'm gonna make you take your pills. Pills, what color? Follow me. All right, dude, pill freak. Don't worry, he'll be asleep in five minutes. He has these attacks sometimes. It's like sleepwalking or something. So, what's the deal, Sherm? Where's the big monster? Shh-hh. Where's Mom and Dad? Where's Gramps? Whoa, man, puke city! P- U! Sherman, did you do this? Careful, you geek, that thing's loaded! Sherman, gimme that, butt-hole! No, there's more in the bomb shelter! Follow me. Come on! Be right back, okay, baby? No sweat. Hey, what's on el tubo? Mom? Dad? Are you there? Hi, kids. Cherry, Spiro, these are the kids. - Hi. - Yassoo. Remember, kids, you do your thing, we do ours. Mother, that is so disgusting! Night-night, now, kids. Try and keep it down, will ya? Thanks. Barf me out! Have any of you seen Gramps? Right here, honeybee. Just takin' care a business. Oh, Gramps, that is totally sicko! I thought it was a monster. That's okay, Sherman. Some day you'll understand. Earthlings, please, you must heed my warning. Its appetite is insatiable. Its curiosity is boundless. Its strength knows no limits. It will continue to absorb all life forms. Sherman, will you please buzz now? Go to bed or something, we wanna hang out. Hey, dig this stupid movie. It's just this one dude talking. Earthlings, please, you must heed my warning. That guy, he's talking about the monster! Would you shut up about the monster! Go to bed! There are no such things as monsters! ...mutating endlessly until your planet is a barren wasteland- Whoa, psychedelic! There it is, the monster! Whoa. Whoa! Run dude! Don't shoot me, dude! No, no! No! Get away! No! OD, get away. Yeah. Stay, dude. Stay. Whoa. Wow, a real, live monster. I told you. Did you see that? He looked right at my studs and cooled out. This dude's into metal! He's so barfy. He is not. He's cool. Oh, this is too rude! Hey, you guys, remember that movie? You know, the one about the little space guy. Made you cry like a butt-hole? E.T., stupid. Yeah. Okay, stand back, guys. Careful, baby. Okay. Easy, dude. Okay, dude. Easy, now, big monster dude. Come on now. Whoa! Easy, dude. All right! - Rad! - Totally awesome! Food, this is called food. It's good for you, yum, yum. Check it out, dude. Mm-mm, good. Food, mm-mm, see? It's good for you. Like vegetables. Mother says, "Eat your vegetables. " Food, food. Food. - Food, food, food. - Food. Come on, dude, spit it out. Food, say it. Food. Yeah, that's it, right! - Why, it can talk! - All right, nice one, dude! Oh, yeah, here, here, try some! Go ahead, dude, pig out. This is music. Mu-sic. It's almost as important as food. Ooh, bad tune, dude. Don't ever listen to that kinda music. Rots your brain. Now, this is my band. I wrote this song. Bitchin', huh? Ha-ha! All right, dude, metal! Okay, I'm OD. O- D. D- O. O- D. OD, man. All right, man, this is incredible. Lemme try. Hi, monster. I'm Suzy. Su-zy. Suzy. Wow, he's cute. I don't believe this. Move over, it's my turn. Okay, monster- Sherman. I'm Sherman. Sherman. Say it. Sherman. - Sher, Sher, Sher, Sher- - Yeah, Sherman. Sherman! This is TV. T- V. Next to food and music, this is mankind's greatest invention. Watch. I had a date the other night. Poor fella. I turned all the lights off and I whispered to him, "Whatever you do, honey, don't look at me. One glance and you're hard as a rock. " Needless to say, the poor guy peeked. Now you see why I have this thing for phone freaks. Hey, guys, come here a minute. Be right back, okay monster? What are we going to do with him? We're gonna make a million bucks. - Huh? - Huh? Don'tcha see, this is like, amazing. I mean, a monster from outer space, like- it's like we own him! Oh, yeah, rude! I mean, that guy probably doesn't even know what money is. Hey, wait a minute, bozo. Who said anything about you? I'm the one who saw him first. Grampa and me discovered him. He came through our TV. He's our property. Hey, spud, I'm the one who communicated with him first. He takes orders from me, so, watch it, dude. Come on you guys. Don't be so selfish. Why can't he belong to all of us? Yeah, come on, dude. This is like... a miracle or something. There'll be plenty of dough for all of us. What about Mom and Dad? Shouldn't we tell them? Forget Mom and Dad, we don't have to share anything with them! They wouldn't believe us anyway. So, like, partners, okay? Partners- okay, Sherm? I guess so. Oh, cool, cool, you guys are really cool, man. So... first thing... I think... we have to get him on TV. Well, it's time for Medusa's beauty sleep now, kiddies. So, 'til next week, Medusa hopes you have some real... wet... nightmares. I know. Medusa, maybe she'll help us. Yeah, dude, she understands monsters. Let's call her. But no more partners, okay? Here, let me do the talking. No, I've already called her once tonight. She knows me. You told her about the monster? Yeah, but she didn't believe me either. - TV. - Whoa! Whatsa matter, dude? TV. Whoa, I hope this guy's house trained. Uh, for Chrissake, will somebody get me outta this thing? Oh, Medusa, you were wonderful tonight. You were absolutely brilliant. Come on, come on, come on! Hey, Al, uh, give me brew and, uh, give me a smoke. Okay, I'll be right back. All right, thanks, pal. Show's over, sucker. Hello, Medusa, this is Sherman again, remember me? Sherman? The schizo. Well, you know that monster I told you about? He's really here. We're teaching him to talk, me and my sister. And me, man, OD Riley! Well, listen, Sherman, I've had a long night. So, uh, call me next week, huh, we'll chat it up. - But wait! - Let me! Medusa? Oh, who's this, your split personality? This is Suzy Putterman, Sherman's sister. Business manager for the monster from outer space. So, tell me, Suzy, is your whole family a little cuckoo? Please, Medusa, this is serious! He's a real live monster! We wanna know how to get him on TV. Listen, kid, you want a guest spot, talk to the Letterman people. Medusa's strictly solo. Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta hit some parties. Please, Medusa! I'm sure if you saw him, you'd be interested. Oh, yeah? Yeah, and we're having sort of a... party for him here, right now. A real fun party. Party, huh? You could just come and take a look. No obligation. He's gonna be a big sensation. He talks and everything. If you don't help us, someone will. Oh, yeah? We're on Putterman Lane off Lonesome Canyon, at the end of the road. Well, like I said, kid, I got some other parties to hit. So, uh, don't count on me anytime soon. Uh, bye, now. - She coming? - Who knows? - She had a crummy attitude. - Hmm. TV, TV. That's okay, guy, there's always somethin' else on. That's what's so cool about TV. TV! Hey, hold your horses, turkey. What are you doing? Hey, man, nothing. This guy just doesn't dig commercials. Be careful, you guys. He wants music. Shh, come on now, be quiet, okay? Yeah, dude, don't be so impatient, butt-hole. What's your name? What planet are you from? He doesn't know what you're talking about. He's just a monster. I'll get it. It's her already? No way! Hey, hey don't let any strangers in. I have a warrant here for the arrest of Sherman Putterman. Huh? Hi, guy. Hi, monster. Hi, monster. Hey, it's that same dude again. ...too late. It's appetite is uncontrollable. The slightest excitement can trigger a monstrous eating binge. I bet you anything he's talking about the monster. I am your friend, Pluthar. Hey, hey, cool it! We're, uh, having a little, uh, party. Hey, hey! Hey, I said shut up, butt-hole! - Oh, my God! - All right, get back, lady! - Oh! - Sis, sis! - Oh! - Sis, run quick! Freeze, son, you're under arrest. Hey, hey! Hey, you kids, come back here! You come outta there or I'm gonna come in after you. Damn you, kids, you- What happened? Saw that space guy on TV. Went crazy! Where's OD? It ate him. Oh, my God! What are we gonna do? We're gonna blow his butt to kingdom come. Huh? First, secure the perimeter. Sherman? I'm calling the cops. Second, break out the fire power. Doo-doo, they cut off our phone! Sherman, have you been making prank calls again? Here, best chance to stop him is a brain shot. What are you talking about? We don't even know where his brain is! This is so stupid, Sherman. This is like, totally disgusting! Let's split, we can use that cop's radio. No, gotta evacuate Mom and Dad first. Wow, these grenades are pretty neat. Maybe I killed it already. Didn't sound too dead when it ate that cop. Yeah, well, maybe I wounded it. OD! Oh! Gross! Sis, get back! Oh! Mom? Dad? You guys in here? Mommy? Are you okay? It ate them! Sherman, let's get out of here! Perfect setup for a surprise attack. Attack? I'm so sure! The hand grenade didn't even phase him! I've got an idea. Huh? Cover me. Be careful! Hi, monster. It's me, Sherman. Boy- Attack! Attack! Sis, the remote on the wall- throw it in the water! Now, throw it! Throw it! Let's get outta here, Sherman! Sis, stop! Earth children, please, I mean you no harm. I am Pluthar, here to save you. Hey, it's the space guy from TV. Whatta you want from us? Please, Earthling, there is little time. I've come to exterminate the hungry beast. Like, what is going on around here? What is the hungry beast? On my planet, the hungry beast is a house pet, similar to your earthly dogs and cats. But they are highly unstable, prone to mutate wildly and eat everything in sight. When mutation occurs, they must be exterminated at once. You mean, like... he was somebody's pet? Oh, yes. They're very lovable before they mutate. Okay, but like, how did it get here? In our house? In the extermination process, they are converted to pure energy, beamed to the farthest reaches of the universe. It's really a very safe form of waste disposal. Yeah, but like, what did it do with Mommy and Daddy? - And OD and Gramps? - And the TV guy? The beast has ingested Earthlings? Oh, dear, heavens, I'll lose my position for this. Who cares about your stupid position, what about them? Well... we do have a process. If I can take the beast back alive, which isn't likely, the victim's genes could be extracted from the hungry beast's tissue and grown in special serum cultures. You mean, like, clones? Clones of Mommy and Daddy? No, no, they'd be the real Mommy and Daddy. Of course, they'd have to live in special aquariums. Come on, come on, come on, chee! Right, neighbors already callin' the cops. Oh, now this looks like a happening party. Yeah. Messy crowd. What? Please, children, lay down your weapons and take me to the beast. Very well, let's go. Son of a bitch! Medusa! Not so fast, asshole! Yah! Ugly bastard! Uh. I'm... losing... pressure! Ooh! Oh, my God! Right in the nick of time, huh? You killed him! Spaceman, spaceman, please don't die! Hey, what's with you guys? I just saved your ass! How 'bout a little gratitude? You killed him! You killed him, you stupid bitch! It was our only hope! Huh? Hey, what are you guys, nuts? Hey, I'm history, man, I'm outta here. Shoot him, Sherman, shoot him! Shoot him, Sherman, shoot him! Come on, kid, blast him! I can't, it won't work! Shoot that gun! That's it, I'm outta here! The studio, Al, and make it snappy! Come on, come on, come on!
