Father's asleep. Tell me... why weren't you at the dance last night? There's a dance every Sunday at the Cascade. - Do you go? - Yes. - You meet nice people. - Like who? Andr, Monsieur Bouzique, Victor. I danced with Victor all evening. Does he dance as stupidly as he walks? You're awful. Why don't you come? - I can't dance. - I could teach you. I'd rather not. Where did you go? I went for a walk, to breathe the night air on the jetty. - All alone? - Yes, but I ran into Monsieur Brun. - He's back? - Yesterday. Why did he go? To take a course. He went to Paris a clerk and came back an inspector. - Inspectors earn a lot of money. - Monsieur Brun? They need to, with all those starched collars they wear. That's the Saigon. - How do you know? - And the Yara's whistle. What's that? - That whistle. - It's the Yara. Idiot. It's the percolator. You bought her a coffee? Want a cup? Why? There'll be nothing left for our customers. You begrudge me a cup of coffee? - It's the principle of the thing. - What principle? Drinking the profits. You make me look so small. Make you look small? How? What do you take me for? A son who must obey his father. At his age? I was 32 when I felt my father's boot for the last time. We knew what love and respect were in those days. - And a kick in the pants. - We didn't answer back. I can't imagine Mother hitting me. You'd snivel in a corner. It's a pity your father isn't here to whip you into shape. All our children do is poison our lives. Poison your life? I share the work. Some sharing. Never here when you're wanted. - I'm here all day. - He's right. What business is it of yours? You work the whole time with such a sad, sorry expression. Anyone would think you were a teetotaler. Maybe I'm neurasthenic. - Is that catching? - It just happens. Don't try to make fun of your father. And you go and sell your shellfish. Leave us alone. You're a slacker. Just like your Uncle Emil. Just dragging his own shadow along wore him out. You moon about, don't know your job. You don't even know your own job. You can't make a vermouth and black currant. And as for a Picon-Curaao, forget it. Yesterday old Cougard came to complain. And yet it's easy. Look. You put one third Curaao. A very small third, mind you. A third of lemon. A good third of Picon. And then a large third of water. That's four thirds. So? A glass only holds three thirds. That depends on the size of the thirds. - No, it doesn't. - Why not? It's arithmetic. Well, don't try to change the subject. And the drip on the bottle. Is that arithmetic too? What drip? The drip you always leave on the bottle. It's not difficult. You have to pour it like this. Twist the bottle and put the drip back with the cork. But Master Marius doesn't care, so it trickles onto the label. That's why the bottles are easier to pick up than put down. - Funny, is it? - You're laughing too. If I didn't, I'd cry. Tomorrow at 9:00 all hands on deck. Drumroll! Leading Seaman Piquoiseau, I declare you Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. Drumroll! Have you gone crazy? There's a spy on board. Admiral Escartefigue, you're reduced to the ranks. Put him in irons till we reach Manila. Admiral Escartefigue is reduced to the ranks. Captain! - Isn't it time we left, Captain? - Are there enough people? - They're signaling like mad on the quay. - How? Like this. It's probably just some Italians talking. No, they're gesticulating. I'll see to it later. Meanwhile, raise some steam and pull the whistle. That'll calm them down. Only three blasts or you'll use up all the steam. And don't open the throttle too far. Otherwise it will never shut again. The ferry isn't popular anymore? The transporter bridge has taken away my customers. Now they all use the bridge. It's modern, and they aren't seasick. You've had people get seasick on your boat? Who? Me. - On a 300-foot crossing? - What 300 feet? It's 675 feet. I should know. I've crossed every day for the last 30 years. Thirty years. Monsieur Escartefigue, how do you feel when you see the others? What others? The boats that go out rather than across the harbor. Why should I think anything? They go so far. Yes, and sometimes so deep. Last thing at night, when you see all the lights on the water, haven't you ever wanted to turn round and put out to sea? Out to sea? You're mad, my poor Marius. - No. I see through you. - And what do you see? You hate being stuck here. - I hate it? - Yes, own up. When you drink with the captains back from Brazil or Madagascar, when they tell you about their voyages, I can see you care. I'm glad they're home safe and sound. - That's all? - That's all. Marius, I'm proud to be a sailor and a captain, master on board after God. But Madagascar can go to hell. I've nothing against patriotism. I'm glad the French flag flies over those faraway lands, though I can't say it does much for me. But to go there - especially by boat - no thanks. I'm quite happy here. I can't believe my ears. Well, so long. He's calling me. He hates to keep passengers waiting. Such a good lad. He's using up all my steam. The silly ass! Idiot! Look out. Full steam ahead. So, Monsieur Brun, what did you think of Paris? Sensational. Did you manage to explore at all? I took a stroll each evening. - So you met Landolfi. - Who's that? He was in the army with me. Tall and fair. With a mustache and a constant blink. You can't miss him. No, I didn't see him. Then you can't have been in Paris. But I was. - And you didn't see Landolfi? - No. Then he must be dead. - Paris is very big, you know. - Sure, it's big. It's a lot bigger than Marseilles, right? Forty times as big. That trip has gone to your head. They say we Marseillais exaggerate. But 40 times bigger. That's a good one. You're a true Lyonnais. Oh, my God, it's 12:30. Where's he gone? To change. Today's Monday. - What's so special about Mondays? - Don't you know? Every Monday my father has lunch with his girlfriend. A beautiful buxom Italian. No, he's changed to a Dutch woman at least twice the size. When he goes to see her, he makes excuses to hide it. But it's no crime. He's a widower. A widower? Please! Don't say that word, Monsieur Brun. - You don't know of my misfortune? - What misfortune? Madame Panisse? Three months tomorrow. On Friday, she'd eaten a sumptuous dish of snails and fish. - And that Sunday she passed away. - Just like that? Say what you will, the good Lord is not very kind. Such a devoted wife, and so good at putting the employees to work. And at home she loved a laugh. She was always ready for a little joke. At breakfast, I'd chase her round the table in her shift. I'd give her little slaps. I'd pinch her nicely... in fun. In revenge, she'd tickle me. I'm sure you'd rather not talk about it. When I think that all that is gone forever. I weep every night. I can't go on, Monsieur Brun. What's to be done? I've made up my mind. Come on now. Think it over. I have already. I can't endure such suffering any longer. Don't act hastily. I've decided to marry again at once. - Marry again? - As soon as possible. After all, she's dead. I can't bring her back. Some may say I've not waited long enough, but my conscience is clear. I've wept more in four months than others do in years. Tears as big as that, Monsieur Brun. And moans and cries - I don't know how I've borne it. Yes, I'm to be pitied. Cheers. What do you think? I'll wager you've got someone in mind. Yes, of course. I'm going to propose today. Who is it? I can't tell you yet. But I'll be sending you an invitation to the wedding. I'm inviting all my clients and friends. There will be only one person missing. My poor Felicity. She always loved a party. But that's life. It wasn't God's will. She'll be happier up there looking down on events. The Malaisie's mate is here. Right. It's a big order. I must put my best foot forward. They asked about sails yesterday. - A large ship? - Yes, leaving on an expedition. On a three-master? They'll be studying winds and currents in the South Seas. There's an auxiliary engine. Panisse, hurry up. That's enough. All in good time. - You want to kill me? - We must all die one day. When one isn't rich, one has to work. He's none too happy. In Marseilles, nothing comes harder than work. So, Fanny, is it settled? What? I may ask your mother for your hand? Anyone may ask. You don't think I'm being foolish? That's for Mother to decide. The exquisite modesty of a true maiden. There you are, sir. I won't keep you a moment. Pretend you know nothing. He thinks no one knows. Well, I'm going out. Just for a little walk round the town. Nothing important. I really must get rid of this hat. I may pop into Mostegui's for some fish soup and a steak with fries. Well, I'm off. No need to explain yourself. I'm not explaining myself. Why should I, at my age? I'm just informing you that I'm going to Mostegui's. So that's where we can find you. No, there's no need for anyone to come to Mostegui's. If you want something, ask me now. You said... I said... I've nothing to say. I don't need your permission to go out. Of course not. Damn it, what does this inquisition mean? If I were 86, I'd understand your spying on me. But I'm not senile. I won't drown. Dad, off you go. It's quite natural. There you are. My son says it's quite natural. I shall go - naturally. People should mind their own business. It's mere suspicion. And I won't be suspected by a Lyonnais. No offense meant. If Picon comes, take 12 bottles. That'll be 240 francs. Twelve bottles. Don't forget. No need to tell me. Leave it to me. Good God, give me patience. What did I do to deserve such a son? He can't be mine. I don't believe it. If Picon comes, take 12 bottles. On second thought, don't. I'll telephone. - My poor boy. - What do you mean? You'll be late for your own funeral. Panisse, have you really thought about this? Of course I have. She's 30 years your junior. Is that my fault? I'll give her everything she wants - money, jewels... You're a good man, but I'm afraid she might find something lacking. I'll say no more. Don't talk about what you don't know. - I know love is wonderful. - Agreed. - But it's best at 20. - She is 20. - But you're 50. - And I've got lots of money. My dear Panisse, nightgowns don't have pockets. I'm only speaking for your own good. You'd be a good catch, but when I look at you, I see a huge pair of horns. You're wrong. Just say yes and leave the rest to me. I'm going to be married. To whom? No one knows yet. I'm telling you because I need some advice. Who is it? - He asked for my hand. - Who did? - Perhaps I shouldn't say. - Don't then. You'll know soon enough. It's Victor. Everybody knows that. He comes every night for your shellfish. It's a wonder he hasn't died. - Proving what? - He's an idiot. And he won't get the shop till his dad dies. I don't want the shop, and I don't care a fig for Victor. Then who is it? What? Old Panisse? - You don't believe me? - No, I don't. - So you won't advise me? - Yes, when you find a better story. The man has bags under his eyes. Taking a rest, my dear? Keeping cool. Yes, "The sun is king today but hide your lovely face lest he should burn in his embrace the pride of Love's nosegay." - Well said. - Did you make that up? I'd say I did, but you'd only see it on the pots of face cream in the window of the corner shop. But the right poem at the right time lends tone to a conversation. Marius, two anisettes. - Is one of those for me? - Who else? Come and sit down. I talked to your mother. She's checking my accounts, but I think she'll agree, if you say yes. Give me a few days to consider. Of course. I don't mind waiting. I'll be even more pleased when you say yes. - How many workers do you have? - Twenty-three. Fill up those glasses, my boy. - They are full. - Liar. I'm lying? - Then let me fill them. - Careful! You're spilling it. He's a bit tired today. That's no way to behave. Darn. I forgot my matches. Wait, Panisse. How delightful a light is when proffered by a pretty hand. My hands aren't pretty. They're so small. So soft... and warm. And such a pretty ring. - You like it? - Very much. Is it gold? I don't know. It was in a cracker. Then it must be brass. Too bad. Do you have a gold ring? But your necklace is gold? Yes, my Aunt Zo gave it to me for my First Communion. It's very pretty. What's the medallion on it? Just a minute. I'll show you. - What does it say? - My date of birth. Fanny, your mother's calling you. - I didn't hear anything. - Well, she is. She knows where to find you. Let's talk seriously. Your mother and I have discussed figures and... Am I disturbing your chat? You stopped talking. We may have private matters to discuss. Some filth, I reckon. Filth? Don't be so rude. Remember whom you're addressing. Looking at you makes me feel sick. Don't look then. - And don't scowl at me. - So now I'm scowling at you? - Have you gone mad? - Poor lunatic. Lunatics can be very dangerous. I know one who'd love to hit you. Hit me? My poor boy. Come out here, if you're a man. - You're still wet behind the ears. - Just see if I am. You're afraid. Marius, you don't want to see me roused. Don't I? You miserable wretch. Wretch? Did you call me a wretch? Leave this to us men. Hold my hat. - Go on, hit me! - Box my ears. - Poor kid. - Miserable wretch. - Poor boy. - Shopkeeper! - All talk and no action. - You're all hot air. - If I'd less control... - If your hair weren't gray. You want me to tear it out? Is that it? You've got customers. I'm busy! Thank your lucky stars. Fanny, business calls. Will you come over for tea later? Why not here? I'll never set foot in this bar again. People should know their place. Your Parisian accent doesn't impress me. I will expect you later. Two anisettes at two francs twenty-five. That's four francs fifty. Here's five francs. Keep the change... waiter. You shouldn't get worked up over things that don't concern you. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes! It's shameful what you're doing to that poor old man. What poor old man? You might have killed him. When he looked down your blouse, he went as red as a lobster. You went redder. Besides, I'm wearing a bra. - And it's none of your business anyway. - You're right. I've got better things to worry about. I don't like to see you becoming like your Aunt Zo. Don't I have a right to marry? Come on. Think it through. What does that mean? Marriage doesn't end at the church. It's a start. - And after that? - The wedding breakfast. - Then what? - I'll see. - He'll kiss you. - If he must. He'll kiss you on the neck and lips. Don't talk about that. I have to. It'll be too late afterwards. He'll take you in his arms... the dirty old man. Dirty bastard! You can laugh, but it's not true. What's not true? You think I'm jealous. You have to be in love to be jealous. Exactly. And I'm not. We're friends, nothing more. Mind you, I could easily have fallen for you. You're so pretty. But I didn't want to. - Can you look after the place a moment? - What if there's a customer? I won't be long. Bartoli will take you on. - For how long? - Ten months. Ten months? Suez, Aden, Bombay, Colombo, Makassar, Sydney. The same voyage as the Malaisie. All right. It's not a sure thing yet. I've signed on a Corsican. But if he's not here tonight, you can take his place. We sail at midnight. So soon? So much the better. - How will I know? - I'll come and tell you. Your papers are in order? What's the matter? Just a headache. Was that why you were crying all night long too? Enough of this nonsense. Tell me the truth. I'm leaving for Aix tonight, and I'm not going till you tell me. Don't worry, Mother. It's nothing. I suppose it's that worthless Marius. I've been watching him for a long time. You love him? How stupid can you be? You can have Monsieur Panisse. Such a nice man, so kind, so charming and so rich too. Yet you weep over a boy who washes glasses. Well, if that's what you want, I won't stop you. Come on, you little ninny. Don't cry. If you want him, you'll have him. He doesn't want me. He doesn't want you? He doesn't want to marry me. He said that? When? Where? Why? Go and tell Panisse to come over for some champagne. It's a long way. It's only a step. Get a move on. - What will you give me if I go? - A glass of wine. Now go! Panisse! Come and have some champagne with Monsieur Csar. You damned idiot! You'll have every drunk in town rushing in here. Here's some for you. I didn't see you yesterday. Let's have some champagne. Since you ask me, it would be impolite to refuse. But I swore I'd never set foot in this place again. Why would you swear that? Your son was very rude. My son was rude? Yes, very rude. Next time I see him, I will kick him in the backside. Notice I'm not wearing espadrilles. I've got shoes on today. - You say that to me? - Yes, to you. Lay a hand on Marius and I'll kick you so hard your teeth will chatter. Lay a finger on Marius and you'll wake up in the hospital. You don't scare me. Touch one hair of his head and you'll wake up in the cemetery. I've knocked out bigger men than you. Holy Virgin, it's murder- but you asked for it. The champagne! What a pity. It's not chilled. Yes, it's a bit warm. But it's not bad. I'll put a bottle down the well for tomorrow. We'll soon arrange it. Don't worry. But if you don't want Monsieur Panisse, you should tell him so right away. I'll speak to Csar, that brute! No, Mother, please don't tell anyone. Let me deal with this myself, please. Very well. I won't say anything. I promise. Though I'd like to give that barman who rejected you a piece of my mind! Come on, silly. Eat your soup. And don't cry into it. It's salty enough as it is. Panisse, if you meet Marius, don't kick him. You know I won't. It was only my pride talking. To your health. - What did the boy do? - He provoked me. He mocked me and my gray hair. You must have said something. You picked a quarrel with him. Why would I do that? I know I've got a quick temper, but I'd never start a quarrel that could end in a massacre. I wasn't even looking at him when he pounced on me. Really? He tried to strangle me. If he starts throttling my customers, what will become of us? - Something's wrong with that boy. - Like what? I don't know. Haven't you noticed anything? Yes, that he tried to strangle me. That's not important. Do you know if he has a mistress? No, I don't. It's a woman, mark my words. Love makes men so stupid. You don't think he fancies Fanny, do you? Surely not. They've known each other too long. I say that because, when he attacked me, I was sitting beside Fanny. - Meaning what? - Maybe he thought I was courting her. Who? You? Go on. You're joking. He wouldn't be jealous of an old man like you. Look at you. You're like an old monkey. No, a woman must be making him suffer. I'm afraid it's Madame Escartefigue. She's made enough men happy. She'd hardly turn away the son of a friend. Speak to Marius. I suppose I must. Marius may be 23, but I'd still cuff him if need be. All the same, I can't talk to him about women. - It's my stupid modesty. - Modesty? Paternal modesty. You're very fastidious. You'd feel the same way if you had a son. This shoe is pressing on my corn. Those are fine shoes you have there. - Are they torpedoes too? - They're my wedding shoes. You must have kept them in mothballs. They're so tight, I think they'll burst. Maybe they won't come off. I can always use scissors. No hard feelings, Csar? Don't worry about your son. It will pass. You look like a ballet dancer. Don't go playing football in those shoes. Good-bye, my friend. She's a fine ship. Come on board. Evening, Csar. Still out at this hour? I'm leaving on the midnight train to see my sister. I came here early because I wanted to talk to you. Go ahead. - It's not that easy. - What is it? It's about Fanny. Fanny... and Marius. Have a seat. That's a nice hat. What will you have to drink? A mandarin and lemon. What's up between Fanny and Marius? Is it so hard to say? Panisse wants my child. What for? In marriage. Panisse wants to marry Fanny? He asked me this morning. He's out of his mind. He wants my answer tomorrow. What does Fanny say? She'll say yes if she can't have the one she wants. And it's Marius she wants? Exactly. Now I understand yesterday's carnage. A terrible fight. The police came. It was pandemonium. Marius wants her to reject Panisse. Did he say he loved her? He hinted at it. Did he kiss her? No. He hinted at it, she said. Without kissing her? That's odd. But they want each other? Marius said he couldn't marry her. He won't say why. He doesn't answer, and he makes her cry. Is that any way to behave? What's he waiting for? A princess? Don't lose your temper, Norine. Maybe he doesn't love her. Then why is he jealous of Panisse? This should be easy to settle. Do it then, because if my child goes on crying, I'll set fire to this place. Calm down now, and sit down. We'll ask Marius about it when he comes in. - Not me. - Why? He mustn't know I was here. I know what men are like. If he hears I came to ask, whenever she lets fall a remark, he'll say, "You asked for me. Your mother said you cried," etc. He'll hate her, and they'll be unhappy. But Fanny mustn't talk about Panisse either. I know what women are like. Their first quarrel and she'll say, "I turned down a wealthy man for you. I'd have had a car, a maid, a boat," etc. It would be the end of him. I know all about that from my poor wife. In 20 years she never let me forget the cattle dealer who proposed to her. But there'll never be another like her. You say nothing, and I'll see she never mentions Panisse. Shall we drink to it? To your health. Do you like the idea of this marriage? That remains to be seen. What would you give Fanny? The cockle business. With a good assistant, it could bring in 40 francs a day, net profit. That's not much. Some people would be glad to take her with nothing. My girl isn't a hunchback. And my boy isn't lame. You may find taller, bigger men, but none more handsome. Laugh if you like, but it's the truth. I'm not saying it because the lad's mine, but he's a fine boy. He's handsome! Very handsome! Don't make me angry. Just 'cause he's handsome, does he have to marry a Rothschild? Of course not. But, if they get married right away, and if they have kids, they'll need money. In that case, I'd give them an allowance as long as I had my fish stall. What will you give your boy? Me? He'll help me in the bar till I retire. They can live here. And I'll give him 1,500 francs a month. That's not enough. You must give him more than that. Such as? You should give him a cod steak, some fresh turbot, a few crabs and some bream. You better stop drinking. It's bad for you. I'd rather have some crayfish. Is this for fish soup? Fish soup. So you're just getting in? We'll talk about it in the morning. Yes, that sort of soup won't keep. I'm off. Good-bye, Csar, Marius. Hello, my dear. What can I do for you? I'd like to talk to you. Let's go inside. Where did you go tonight? I was playing billiards at the Brasserie Suisse. With whom? With some friends. I'm sure that's not true. You were somewhere else. But that's not important. I've something serious to tell you. What? I've lost my cap. Behind you, on the table. Listen. One of these days you'll get married. Me? Why? Why? It's natural, and good for business. Surely you don't want to remain a bachelor. I've given it no thought. Maybe it's time you did. Panisse has asked Fanny to marry him. I don't see the connection. Marius, don't take me for an idiot. Can't you hear me? Don't take me for an idiot. I know you love Fanny. - Who told you that? - A little bird. A clever little bird. You love Fanny, and I can prove it. That's why you attacked Panisse like a wild beast, nearly throttling the poor old chap. He's out to find you. He's put shoes on. He's walking around like this. - We just had a little quarrel about... - About what? I don't even know what. I know. It was about Fanny. You wanted to eliminate a rival. You idiot. If you want to eliminate your rival, propose to Fanny. You think she'd accept? You talked to her mother? What? You talked to her mother? What was that? What do you mean? Ah, her mother. She has a pretty hat. No, I didn't talk to her, but I think she'd say yes. Maybe. But I'm not interested. I don't think I love her enough to marry her. You're lying. Why? - 'Cause you're lying. - I'm lying? What's all this? I said you're lying. You love Fanny. You're furious because someone else wants her, yet you refuse to marry her. You're very trying, Marius. If you're crazy, be honest and tell me. I'll send you to the loony bin. If you're not, trust me and tell the truth. There's a woman at the bottom of this, isn't there? Tell me! Yes... you're right. I guessed as much. Who is she? Listen... I'm embarrassed to talk about it. Me too. But I want to know why you're being so stupid. You can't love the girl. Maybe I pity her. And that's what makes you stupid? Listen, Marius. All right, I'll explain. I loved a girl, and she's in love with me. I'd hurt her if I said I was getting married. She might kill herself. Don't exaggerate. I need time to get her used to the idea. It's as simple as that. Simple. Well, let's forget it. I won't ask her name, because you wouldn't tell me. It's not Madame Escartefigue, is it? No, it isn't. - You're sure? - I just told you. Be careful. Monsieur Escartefigue is a friend of mine, and a good customer. I don't want you playing around with the customers' wives. We won't say anything more about it. But what shall we do about Fanny? Leave it. Give me the receipts. - What if she accepts Panisse? - She won't accept. But if she did. If she accepts him, it's just too bad. Stop that nonsense. That's no way to talk. We'll go over it in the morning. Tomorrow morning? Yeah, I'm going to turn in. It's going to prey on my mind all night. I doubt it, the way you're yawning. Good night.r I'm very fond of you, you know. What's that? I'm very fond of you.b I'm fond of you too. What made you say that? I don't know.s You've been thinking and worrying about me. It reminds me that I love you. Of course. Good night. Good night... son. Sometimes I say you'll be the death of me. It isn't true. Has the Corsican come? The big ship isn't in the harbor yet, but she's coming.p Listen. Go quickly. I'll close up. When you come back, knock on the shutter. Good night, Monsieur Panisse. See you tomorrow. And don't worry about me. - Who's there? - It's me. Is something wrong? It's nothing.d I forgot the key to my stall, so I couldn't lock up till I'd gotten it. Then I saw a light through the crack, so I knocked. I'm glad you did.n Besides, I wanted to tell you - I followed your advice. - What advice? I turned down Panisse. Perhaps that was a mistake. You advised me to do it. Maybe you were a bit hasty. Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut and not taken the responsibility. Listen, Fanny... my father hasn't gone to bed yet. See you tomorrow.n All right. Since you're turning me away. I'm not turning you away. Fanny, don't be angry. Come in for a moment. Have a seat. Let's talk about this marriage. I want to speak to you like a brother. But you're not. - You're like my sister. - No, I'm not. What is it, Fanny? It's you I love and you I want. Do me a favor and don't look at me. You shouldn't have told me. Don't you love me too? Yes, you love me. I know it. Tell me you do. I can't marry. Why? Because you have a mistress? Come out with it. It's nothing to be ashamed of. - I asked Anna if it was her. - What? - What will she think? - I couldn't care less. I won't rest till I've found out who it is. - It's no one! - Some girl has sunk her claws into you. How would she do that?f Maybe she's had a child by you. You've got a child? Is that it? I can't say I have when I haven't. Then it's just that you don't want me. Why? Are you ashamed of my Aunt Zo? If I were going to get married, I'd marry you. Now don't ask any more questions. Who's with you? No one. I'm tidying up. Listen to that. Can't you sleep? Go to bed, you idiot. Check the third beer keg and make sure the tap is turned off. I'll take a look.s We'll talk again tomorrow. Tell me your secret. You might not understand. You might betray me. Me? Betray you?e All right. I'll tell you. - I'm leaving. - Leaving? For where? Anywhere. Far away. Is it your father? What is driving you away? Nothing... it's just a longing. Take me with you.. No, I can't. It's the sea! Is this Piquoiseau's idea? No. I've wanted to go for a long time. One night, a sailing ship berthed right here. Her cargo was wood from the West Indies. Black wood, all golden inside, smelling of camphor and pepper. The ship came from the Leeward Islands. The crew came in here and told me about their country. I drank the rum they'd brought. It was very sweet and spicy. Then, one night, they left, and I went out on the pier. I looked at that fine three-master sailing into the sun towards the Leeward Islands. Since then, I've been under a spell. Was there a woman on the boat? I knew you wouldn't understand. Is it the islands, then? I'd prefer never to go there, but to keep them as I imagined them. I long for distant places. It may seem silly. It's something I can't explain, but that's how it is. I long for distant places. And that's why you want to leave me? Now that you know, you'd better go. If I go now, I feel I may never see you again. You'll see me here in the morning. You're leaving tonight. If they call me. Marius, please, don't go. Go on some other boat, some other day. You don't love me. I don't love you? If I didn't, I'd have left long ago. - But now I've made up my mind. - But why? Can't you understand why? When I'm on the pier, looking at the sky, I'm already away. Every ship on the sea tugs at me. I forget where I am, what I'm doing. It's as if I were mad. Remember when we went on the transporter bridge? You were dizzy, afraid you'd fall. That's how I feel. When I see a ship leaving, I'm drawn towards her. I can't control myself. I wouldn't make you happy. You've only got one life. I'd ruin it. If you leave, my life is finished. You're young. You'll forget. Forget you? That's impossible, Marius. I've always loved you, even when I still had pigtails. When you were in the army, I learned to sew, so I could wear a new dress when you came on leave. Every time you spoke to a girl, I wished she'd drop dead. You were always in my dreams of the future. I longed to grow up to become your wife. Every morning I thought, "He'll say something today." I've tried everything to make you talk. And now that you've said you love me, you're leaving. Someone knocked! I'll love you always, Marius. It's no use crying. It won't change my mind. Let me go. Forget me. Never, Marius. I'll wait for you. Don't. I'll leave again. Don't answer!r I'll drown myself. The Corsican is back. He's back? You're not leaving, Marius. You're not leaving. Don't be sad - please. I'll love you so much you'll be cured. It's over now, Marius. I'm keeping you. Give us a bottle of rum. You're still up. We can see your light. What's all that noise about? We want some rum.d There's no rum. We're closed. Marius.! Are you in bed? Dad's coming down.r What can he be doing?n You in bed? He's asleep. Never.r ONE MONTH LATERu It's your turn to play. I know, but I can't decide. Make up your mind. We're all waiting, Captain. It's a serious moment. They're ahead. This hand settles the game. Is Panisse trumping hearts? If you'd been concentrating, you'd know. Why don't you just show him your cards? I never said a thing. You're not allowed to speak. In a competition, you'd be disqualified. I've played in lots of competitions, but I never saw you at any of them. I still don't know if Panisse is trumping hearts. When you're playing, you mustn't say anything. I'm only thinking aloud. Well, don't. He's right. There's no need to talk. I must ask you not to make signs. Keep your eyes on your cards. You too!o If you go on making faces, I'm going home. They've lost anyway. I wouldn't hesitate a second if I knew Panisse was trumping hearts. There they go, making faces. You watch him, and I'll watch Csar. You'd treat an old school buddy like a cheat? Thanks a lot. Have I upset you? Not at all. Treat me like a gangster. Go ahead. You break my heart. You break my heart.h You break my heart. You break my heart! Aren't we playing any longer? He broke my heart. What about you? I see. Good. Hearts. Do you take me for a fool? You gave him to understand I was trumping hearts. There, take your cards! I don't play with cheats! Nobody takes Panisse for a ride. Breaking your heart indeed! He's not pleased. He's really cross. You really shouldn't have cheated. If you can't cheat among friends, why bother to play? And it was a clever ruse. He has such a temper. He's impossible. Let's play one last hand. Loser pays for the drinks. Good night, Monsieur Csar. Off to bed already? No, I'm taking Mother to the station. That's a very nice thing to do. See she catches her train. Good night, gentlemen. It's a good thing Fanny doesn't know where he's going. Why?l - He's off to see his old mistress. - That rascal! - He'll spend the night there. - Tell us more. In a minute he'll come out and say, "Good night, Dad." I'll say, "Going out?" And he'll say, "Yes, to the movies." He goes out, climbs back through the window, and locks his door on the inside. What for? I wake him in the morning. If the door is locked, I think he's sleeping. He's not stupid, my son, but then, neither am I. I've never told him that I've looked in through his window. It's all good fun. Going out? Just to the movies. Need any money?a I have enough. Doesn't he look smart? Smarter than both of you. I didn't really mean it. A bow tie, even. - Don't be late. - Midnight or 1:00. No later. And be good. Be good! He'll be off round the back now. Tell me, Csar... who is Marius's mistress? I've never tried to find out. It's a delicate issue. The boy is an adult now. But I suspect it's a sailor's wife. Why? If he spends the whole night with her, her husband must be away. - Thirty-five. - Thirty-six. Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven?j Besides, everyone knows the navy is full of cuckolds. What?i The navy is full of cuckolds. I called 40! Feeling cold? You need your jacket on? What did you do? Was it what I said about the navy? Forgive me, old chap. Are you speaking to the sailor or the cuckold? Both.v It's no laughing matter. There's no need to be so angry. It's not your fault you're a cuckold. After all, everyone knows. Monsieur Brun didn't. He's the one who told me! Besides, it's common knowledge. It's none of your business, and I forbid you to insult the French navy. After what you said, I can play no longer. That's the end of it. I'll expect your apology in the morning. If it's an apology you want, I'll say I'm sorry right now. No, I demand an apology that reflects the gravity of your remarks. Come on, Felix, don't be stupid. I had no intention of insulting the navy. I admire the French navy.. Maybe you do admire the French navy, but the French navy says go to hell! What on earth did he mean? It's not nice what they've done to you. - Me? - Yes, you. They've left you to pay for the drinks. You mean they left us to pay? What do you mean, us? Yes, we were partners. - We'll play for it. - It's rather late. We've never played cart together, have we? And you wanted to leave for the land of the monkeys! Wasn't that silly?o It was totally inexplicable. You won't think about it anymore, will you? Not as I did before. The spell is broken forever. - So when do we marry? - Whenever you like. I'll talk to Dad in the morning and your mother tomorrow evening. Shall I tell you my idea for where we'll live? - You've got a plan? - I've already imagined everything. Go on then. Tell me. We'll take over your father's room. That's a bad start. Father will never give it up. Why?w Think about it. That's where Mother died. Since she died, nothing has been moved. All right, then, we'll use yours. I'll fix it up real nice. I'll have it papered in blue - it goes well with my hair. Then there's the furniture. Between the windows I'll put Aunt Zo's chest of drawers. It's very old and worth a lot of money. On the other side...y What is it? It's a ship sounding its horn so it doesn't have a collision. It must be a big ship. What are we going to put across from the chest of drawers? Our bed. Monsieur Brun... I'm putting down a king. Another? - I do it all the time. - That could seem odd. Not odd, but difficult. You admit you're cheating? Yes. But since you can't detect it, it's all right. Then I may as well pay at once. As you like. What does it come to? That will be 24 francs. That hat suits you. And here's two francs for the waiter. I'll give it to him later. Well, good-bye, Monsieur Brun. See you tomorrow. Don't tell anyone Escartefigue is a cuckold! He's not here. Where there's Fanny, there's Marius. Sorry to disturb you. Marius, I must talk to you. Go on. Marius has no secrets from me. Listen, Marius, I wanted to say... Say it in front of me, or go. All right. I'm sorry, I'm sure. I'll wait for you in front of your bar. Good night, lovebirds. That's a nuisance. He'll know I haven't gone home to sleep. You can say he missed you. He's bound to tell everyone. I'd better get rid of him at once. - You'll tell me everything? - Of course. Hurry up. I'll wait. Hurry up! The mate of the Malaisie wants to see you. Come on. All the time I've been here, you've said you wanted to go. I've had to send an injured man to the hospital. I gave the captain your papers, and now you want to back out. You should have said so sooner. I can't go.r I'll never trust a Marseillais again. I need more courage to stay than go. I'll say- shifting bottles! - I bet it's on account of a girl. - It's Fanny. That cockle girl? She's nice enough, but there are girls the world over. Are you that badly smitten? - I have to stay. - Why? I owe it to her. Plenty of men wouldn't give a damn. It's up to you, but you'll live to regret it. Never more than now. He's desperate to go. I'd do anything to go. I'm desperate to go, but we can't always do what we want. It's no use insisting.n Then I'll offer the job to Chevalier. I'll come to the bar tomorrow at 11:00 to say good-bye. That lad is going to cry every night. Where's Chevalier? Wait. Don't look for him.s You said he'd cry every night. Do you really think he will? Listen, young lady,r it's obvious the lad won't always be happy. You saw how he cried. You're destroying his life. Be quiet! Could you wait till tomorrow morning to replace him? Why? He might go. Whatever you do, he'll refuse to go now. Come to the bar tomorrow at 10:00. But don't tell him you saw me. Go, hurry! Where were you? What did Piquoiseau want? He just wanted some money. I gave him some. Promise you'll never love another woman. You know I won't. I'll never love another woman. You say you pity her. Since last night, you've had plenty of time for that. It's 9:00. Time you had pity on your father. What is this? I can't believe it. Oh, good God!. Csar.! Here... look at that. You recognize that belt?e Did Marius have an accident? He deserves to, the bastard. Though anyone else would have been worse. They must get married at once. Sit down. What's wrong? I went to Aix as I do every Wednesday. - You go to Aix every Wednesday? - To see my sister. I didn't take the train back because Monsieur Amourdedieu gave me a lift. When I arrived home, what did I find? A bottle, two glasses... and that belt on a chair. Who'd have thought it? Though a belt means nothing. It made my blood run cold. I ran to Fanny's room and opened the door. Holy Virgin, what have I done? My goodness. What did they say? I was so ashamed.i I left without a sound. Marius, that's going a bit far. What have you done, my son? He's a real rascal. She's only 18. She'll end up like her Aunt Zo. How can you say that about Fanny? It doesn't encourage me to give my consent. Don't cry, Honorine. We'll think of something. Come on, stop crying. It'd be worse if she'd broken a leg. Who'd ever have thought it? She seemed so innocent - such a child. Let's hope there's none on the way. How can you laugh about it? Don't you see what it's doing to me? I'm in such a state.. - What will you have? - Just a mandarin and lemon. It's a nuisance, but life isn't all laughs. Things will turn out all right. Don't cry into the croissants. That won't help matters. I mean, really.o Let's have a drink and examine the situation. It's quite simple. I'm going to tear Fanny apart. You wouldn't do that. Wouldn't I? Just you watch. Let me go, Csar. I'll kill her. Come, Honorine. Have a seat and calm down. Do you want the whole town to know? - Think about yourself. - There's no time for that. What if your mother had killed you when you were Curly's fiance? That was different. He lived just across the hall. And it was I who went across to him. Your Marius... I never told Fanny about that. Don't cry. It's bad for your health. Damn your Marius! How dare he come to my own house? He raped my daughter. She can't have screamed very loud. We'll marry them and say no more about it. Children are something. They're so nice when they're tiny. But what can you expect? Youth doesn't last long. I know, but all the same... My poor Norine. Youth passes all too quickly and never comes back. That will be Marius climbing back in. I don't want to see him. I'd strangle him. No, not that way. Go into the kitchen. And stop crying. Stop crying. You trust me, don't you? I promise you they'll be married in two weeks. You can dry your eyes on the dishcloth. It's clean. He'll have to stop showing pity now.m I'll give him time to rehearse his little charade. Just getting here?. I did the housework before coming. You must have done a very thorough job of it. Meanwhile, your stall isn't open. I've got a good mind to give you a thrashing! You should cry after what you've done. I was home at 7:00. Do you follow me? Forgive me. No, I can't. It's unpardonable. You, my own daughter! Couldn't you have gotten married first? None of us was against it. You behaved like Zo. You might have waited till it was legal. He wanted to see you asleep? He has to marry you. I want a proposal by midday. Tell your Marius to hurry up or else! I've never touched a gun in my life, but I swear I'll learn real quick! I'll talk to him myself. No, Mother! You don't understand. If he refuses, don't bother coming home. You'll no longer be my daughter. I'll lock myself in my room and drown in my own tears. Mother, please don't cry. Look at that thief. What are you after? The fishmonger. What do you want? The Hotel Universal placed an order. That's right. The fish are still in the tank. I'll be right over. I won't kiss you until you're engaged. No, Fanny, don't. Let me go. Nice day, eh? Just getting up? What's the time? Just past 9:00. Just past 9:00? Gosh! I stayed up reading in bed last night. It was dawn before I fell asleep. You shouldn't stay up reading so late. It's bad for your health. You don't look too good. I don't? Those books you read must be very tiring. If I didn't know better, I'd wonder where you'd been. Did you call me around 7:00? Just before 7:00. I called you, but you went on sleeping. We heard your snores in here. That's impossible. Why?u I never snore. You even made the customers laugh. Your door was locked, so that was that. Yes, I must have locked it without thinking. Without thinking, eh? Pour your coffee. Breakfast is ready. Your trousers are sliding down. - Really? - Looks that way. Maybe I've lost weight. You read too much. At this rate, you'll end up thin as a rake. Why don't you wear a belt? You're right. I have to get one. That's easily done. What a boy. You've got a good appetite. Not bad. Reading makes you hungry. What a boy.r Tell me.That old mistress of yours. You know, the woman you pitied so much. The one who might kill herself. Are you still seeing her? Of course. - You're still seeing her? - What if I am? You're truly amazing. Why? What a boy! Tell me... did you tell her you're getting married? Not yet, but all the same... I gave her to understand that someday... You don't explain too well, but I get the picture. You may be being kind to that girl, but it's hardly fair on Fanny. Why? Because you're keeping her dangling. - Have you decided to marry her? - Yes. Then why don't you talk to us parents? - She keeps postponing the date. - Why? Whenever I ask her, she says, "We've got plenty of time." - That's odd. - Yes, it is. Sometimes I wonder if she prefers Panisse. She couldn't care less about that old man. - Then why keep putting it off? - That's your fault. Yes, it's your fault! You don't understand women yet. Let me explain. Women are proud and easily hurt. And it's no use trying to hide things from them. They've got a sixth sense. Fanny sees you're in no hurry, so she says, "We've got plenty of time." But if you said, "Meet me at the church tomorrow," she'd be there like a shot. - Maybe you're right. - I know I'm right. I'm right, I tell you. When you see Fanny, have a serious talk with her. You should bear in mind what happened to Zo. Such a nice girl. I don't see what she has to do with me. You don't know the story? It's not very pretty. Zo was good-looking, a bit of a flirt, but she meant no harm. She worked at the match factory. I can still see her passing by the bar. So cute under her big straw hat. She had a way about her. All the men watched her. She'd smile at them, but it never went further than that. Then she fell for a Spanish sailor. He promised to marry her, and said he'd stay. So they rushed things a bit. And then one day he left. He deserted her? He deserted her. Then Zo... It was terrible. The poor kid. Poor girl. When a man deceives a woman, she feels a great revulsion. She can never love again, and she takes to the streets. And, once she gets started there, she has nothing to lose. Honor is like a match. It can only be used once. Why tell me all this?o So you don't just use Fanny for a good time. Understand?b Yes, I understand. I'm sure she's a virgin, and I've seen and know nothing. But if you've been exchanging glances and caresses,t you must get married as soon as possible. Understand? I'll talk to her. Talk to her. Be very insistent. Understand? Because, if you want my opinion, that sailor of Zo's was no man. Are you coming? No. I told you last night. Did you get a replacement? No, I thought you might change your mind. You shouldn't have come. Especially to tell me that. I'm not going. I can't. You're staying here? All right. But if you change your mind, we're across the quay. I won't change my mind. You're making a mistake. A big mistake. Why did you tell me he'd go? Now I'm short a man. He'll be coming. Yes, it certainly looks like it! Women!r Go get your mother. We must speak to her at once! Why the hurry? If you love me, don't lose a moment. Call your mother. Do you really want to marry me so much? Marriage is a serious business. It ties you down for life. Call your mother, I tell you. Are you sure you love me enough? You saw that ship out there? - The Malaisie. - I know. I've got a place on the crew. Theyjust told me. My bag is packed. I've only got to cross the quay. But, as you see, I'm staying. Here, with you. For how long? Forever, if you help me. Maybe, Marius. But you'll never be happy if you marry me. You want to marry me because you feel responsible. But there's no need. You're not responsible. You asked for nothing. It was I who came to you. The fault is entirely mine. Go, Marius. Follow your desires. They don't include me. Fanny, don't tempt me. Just cross the quay. If you love me, take me in your arms, cover my eyes. Hold me as tight as you can. You don't have to suffer. You've still got time. What would become of you if I left? Don't worry. I've thought of that. You've thought of that? What do you mean? You'll marry Panisse? Or someone else. What does it matter? You've spoken to him? Have you? When? Several times.a So you were lying when you said you'd turned him down? I'm not doing it for myself. I have to think of my mother. She's not as young as she was. Love isn't the only thing in life. There are other things stronger than love. So, while I've been struggling with my conscience and suffering in silence, this was all being arranged.e - Where are you going? - Let me go! You see? Go ahead and marry Panisse's money. I'm marrying the sea. You're staying after all? I can't get by. My father's standing out there. Marius...s climb out the window as if you were going to meet your love. In the meantime, I'll keep your father here. No, don't say anything! Just go! If he'd loved me as I love him, he'd have understood. Marius is over there. He wants to see you. No, he's at the station, getting my baskets. - He won't be long. - What's wrong with you? I don't like what I see going on. You should open your eyes. You idiot, I saw it all a long time ago. How flushed you are. Have you been crying? Is that it? Perhaps. You've been crying? Then Marius must have talked to you. So it's settled? I'm glad to hear that. Do you know how long I've been thinking about this wedding? Months?a For the last 11 - no, more like 14 years. Since before you left for Algeria, when you were knee-high to a grasshopper. One night, in this very bar, Marius's mother lifted you up and asked, "Fanny, are you really going to marry Marius?" Everyone laughed - except you. With wide eyes, you said, "Yes." And now it's happening. I'm so glad. Let's take a stroll on the quay. - But the customers... - Let them wait. I'd prefer to stay here. We've got things to talk about. Like what? Where we'll live. We'll need a room. You'll live here with me. You don't think I want to live alone, do you? You know, I bully Marius from time to time, but he's my son, after all. I love him. I'd die if I didn't see him for six months. I've an idea for your lodgings. Have you seen my room? Then I'll show it to you. Here's what I'm thinking. It's nice here. You can't imagine how nice it is in the morning to be woken up by the sun. In summer it reaches the bed. And in winter it climbs up to the clock. Well, what do you think of this room? It's larger than Marius's. Much larger. So this is what I thought. I'm old now. I don't need so much space. I'll take Marius's room, and this one will be yours. Yes, there's certainly more space. There's only one thing I'd ask of you. Leave the bed where it is. Yes... that's where he was born. And it's also where she died. Csar.! The ship's leaving. That's the Malaisie leaving. God protect all who sail on her. You see that door? It leads to a small little room. Well, if you'd like - and I'd like it very much - we'll find a tiny bed. We'll put a tiny bed in there, won't we? Marius, bring some rum! Fanny has fainted! Marius, where have you gone? BASED ON THE PLAY BY MARCEL PAGNOL
