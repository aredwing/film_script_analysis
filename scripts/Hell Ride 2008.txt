After... He got done fucking. It'd be a whole lot easier to explain if you didn't have that gun pointed at my face. My life used to be a... Bike & Booty epic. Because of you and Pistolero it's turned into a whopper. Of a Chopper Opera. Well, if you'd like I could turn your life into an Operetta. Why'd you hit me with that bottle. How many of these do you got? Just one. And I just used it up. Yes, you did son. Order a beer. Well, what do you got? - What do you want? Around here, we drink... American beer! American it is then.

I'm gonna kill the two of you soon as you wear yourselves out a little more. Rope-a-dopes! You know, my life used to be... One long biker party. All the pussy was wide open and The whiskey was flowing. Now it seems my... Life has turned into some kind of a... Psycho symphony. A symphony in six hundred and sixty-six movements. A six hundred and sixty-six cc psycho symphony, With no intermezzos. - SHUT THE FUCK UP! What the hell were you two assholes thinking? Dani, can I be alone with my two assholes? No Victor... Does any business... Without getting the go-ahead from me first. You told us, to never-ever bother you, when you were fucking! I had everything covered. Infiltrators. Rats! Benedict Arnolds up the ass! I had us covered! You had -you- covered! Now goddammit! I rue the day, I became a Victor! And I rue the day, that I brought Bix in! You didn't bring Bix in. He suckered you, into introducing him to me. Nobody likes to be... suckered! Hey. Go easy on him! I actually felt that one. Good. We got some serious hell-fighting to do with Billy Wings. In... or out? Well, I don't know, only one way. Which way's it gonna be? Eeny, meeny, miny, moe. I'm in. Good. I'm holding two aces. I'm holding two aces and one Deuce. I'm holding one Deuce, at the Inn 6. Off of Route 66. I had it covered. I had it all fucking covered. I want you to meet me at Inn 6, Route 66 Tomorrow morning, at 6AM. Think you can remember that? - Are you gonna tell me six more times? Child of six can remember that. Hey. What do those white wings mean? They're for licking virgin pussy. Red wings, for licking a bleeding pussy. See that? Blue and yellow, for licking a police woman. Blue, yellow and brown wings. They're for licking a police woman's asshole. Green wings... For licking a pussy with crabs. And purple wings.. They're for licking a dead pussy. See that? Pill-popping, cunt-eating... dog-smoking motherfucker! But you know... In a good way. Get out of here. Come 'ere. Comanche. I want you to meet Maria. Hello. What the hell are you, and what the fuck is your story? I'm just a guy named Comanche. A Victor... Named Comanche. That's my story. Do you know anything about a key? No, tell me about it. Do you know anything about a safe-deposit box? No... Tell me about it. Ever heard of Cherokee Kisum? I knew a Cherokee Indian woman once. The Deuce did too, from way back. And they weren't busy leading the sexual revolution. They were busy producing acid. They made a fortune on the LSD market. Then coke. The only problem was... She was fucking over the Deuce while she was fucking him. And let me tell you something... She stashed away one hell of a mint. On July 4th, 1976 She went up in flames. She had a boy. Nobody saw that boy ever again. How do I know for sure that you're you? Stand up. Hi Deuce. How are ya? Hello Johnny. It's been, many a moon. Ah, thank you, for this suite Johnny. You know, uh... Hope I'm not being unreasonable, but... No mint on the pillow again, last night. No pillow, in fact. You know Johnny. Mint-whoring is... Not good for business. The key to a good business relationship is, everybody's happy. I'm not happy, Johnny. That's... That's a very nice suit. Yeah, well, it used to be. Before I was Shanghaid two nights ago. I thought you got killed by a big rig back in '86! I ain't happy Johnny. Who is, Deuce? I mean... Tell me if it's none of my business, but I, I... I heard you did a lot of traveling all these years. That's very true. In America. Building an empire. Just right around, the summer of '76 I think, when you... You kind of... You know, Johnny. Motorcycles' a big business. A -big- business. I mean, books, magazines, Clothing, customizing shops. So big that I finally had to give up... Riding bikes, so I could... Concentrate on my motorcycle business. I travelled all over the United States. The Keystone State... the Treasure State... The Show Me State... Setting up businesses. I decided to come back here, because Because I had some, unfinished business. Boy, oh boy. I tell you. I don't know nothing about the... Keystone States... The Treasure State or the Show Me State. I don't know 'em... My business has always been Just kinda minding my own business. So how is business? It's business as usual. Good. Then, can we get down to business? Let's cut a deal. How's this. I get the Sixers of your back. And off of The Gent's back. And uh... You give me whatever you think I'm entitled to For services rendered. And everybody's happy. The three key points of this deal being that... I get deposited back in LA With my entitlement And you and The Gent, get to die old men. Those are the three keypoints of this deal. I've had enough of you. Cut out the double talk. He doesn't know anything about a safe-deposit box or a key. Key...? What... What, what key are you talking about? The key that Cherokee Kisum had made. Who's Cherokee Kisum? Cherokee Kisum was the young woman You kept company with. The young woman, who was set on fire on July 4th, 1976. Deuce, she's gotta burn. No, Johnny, I... I'm sorry, I don't have any recollection of any of this. It was quite a long time ago. Can you recollect setting St. Louie on fire a couple of nights ago? Deuce! I swear! Pistolero never said a fucking thing about Any safe-deposit box! No Johnny. No memory of it at all. But then... I ain't no Marcel Proust. You got any, proof of all this? Do I need fucking proof? Well, you must need something, or... I'd be dead already, wouldn't I? The only reason you're not dead is, before I kill you I wanted to ask Sonny Kisum if he'd like to cut off your head Before I do it. Hell yes. I waited all these years, to kill him with you. We still got business with Billy Wings. Partners in crime, right? I had Eddie Zero trying to track down Sonny Kisum for years. Maybe you would have found Sonny Kisum. If your tracker wasn't a 24/7 hash head. No. No, in my opinion, you don't find Sonny Kisum Until Sonny Kisum wants to be found. I was just about to say that. Cherokee Kisum... Was one wild as hell woman. A good woman. But wild... I gave her my word. If anything happened to her I'd safekeep the treasure for her boy. Is it being kept safe for her? And the safekeeping of Cherokee Kisum was? She wasn't looking to me for safekeeping? I never knew what happened the day she died. And couldn't find anyone who did. It was a thirty-six carrat, Diamond-studded, Solid gold riddle. Look, I'm an owl. Oh man... Get out of here. text 675 In the basket. Ain't that Pistolero one malevolent motherfucker! Follow me to Pistolero! If you can stomach it. Well now, the way I see it. I did got close to that treasure once before. And I ain't gonna let that motherfucker fuck it up again this time. Let's ride! Go home... It all amount to nothing! Pistolero's coming here. Don't fuck up. I need him alive. Hey! Biker biker! Purple wings! Can you two stomach which dead pussy earned me my purple wings? Ain't nothin' you can do to me I can't stomach. You ain't seen nothing yet. Give Comanche the two keys you're holding and let him safekeep 'em for a while. Give Comanche the two keys you're holding And let him safekeep 'em for a while, goddammit! Take a peak at St. Louie, see if he's resting in peace. Look for the cactus flower. You know, you should lighten up on yourself. When you fuck with The Deuce, you're gonna get burned by The Deuce! I met her before she met The Deuce. First met her in 1969. Through Eddie Zero. She was sixteen, I was fourteen. Think about that one. Hey. You okay? - Nada? Yes sir. Did you bring my jacket? Everything okay? - Ah yeah. So... How come we've never met before? I'm Eddie. - I know Eddie. You ever get tired of faking your own death? You got a joint? Sure do. Baby. - Hey Kimosabe... Just how much was in that box for us? From the Cherokee woman. Us? Us, yeah. Like you and me, us, yeah. I know it would come to this. Us. Well, I don't want nothing from it. I'm only curious to know how much is in there. You're just curious... But you don't want nothing from it. No, I don't. It's none of our business, what's in the box. So, what you're saying is... That the booty, in the box, That I've already said, that I don't want nothing from. Is none of my business? So let me get this straight. The box, and the booty that's in it... Which, I've already said That I don't want nothing off, Is none of my business? Put out of the booty business, in other words. Well you're being downright unfriendly now. Where's the cash that Bob the Bum was holding When he got his throat slit. Oh, well I'm holding on to that. I'm keeping it safe. Because that's my destiny. And maybe that's none of your business. Oh, I think it's my business I think it's my business to have it right in my hand right here. Listen, I don't want to have to kill you. I want you to hand over Bob the Bum's cash right now. Go ahead, Go ahead, where do you want to kill me? Here? You want to kill me between the eyes? Right between the eyes, yeah. Go ahead, go ahead, put it right between the fucking eyes. Come on, go ahead. Come on. I was counting on you To do something, to stop this whole fucking rediculous thing. Stop all this bullshit - The hell made you think You could count on me? What got into your fucking brain? Because I love ya. Aw hell. You did good Sonny. I think I'm gonna call you, Son from now on. Cause Sonny's eating up way to much fucking time.
