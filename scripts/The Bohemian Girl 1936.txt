Without a care Anywhere that we may roam is where we make our home Be it on the road or sky On high! ln the sky! Gypsies all Never tire For we make our home away from home We stand, we settle where we roam There our gypsy hearts must be content With a song, and a fire, and a tent With just a song... We gypsies like to ride along The road Along the road As we swing And we sing Our song! Good morning, my queen. - What news, Salinas? - Do you realise where we are? Perfectly well. So once more, we are encamped on the domain of the good Count Arnheim. Count Arnheim! Pah! What we pick up here we must pick up quickly. For he'll never allow us to stay here long. One of these days, l'll... You'll find that we're on the march again With our hearts beating time to a stout fighting song We'll do what we can to march along... - Arline, look! - Sweetheart! How is my little princess this morning? - Tell me, have you had your lesson? - Yes. Count Arnheim, there is a band of gypsies in the woods below the castle. Gypsies, eh? See that they are gone by noon tomorrow. lf they are caught on my estate, have them flogged within an inch of their lives. Tell me, sweetheart, what did you learn at your lesson? That lovely gypsy music How gypsy fiddles fly... That, my son, is the true song of the gypsies. Come and listen how she sings of life and love. ..fade away... When love calls the heart of a gypsy lt calls to the heart that is free The will of a gypsy Caresses her Only to die with the dawn Oh, the road That a gypsy must travel ls planned by the fortunes of time So it's one hour of bliss And a passionate kiss Then farewell to gypsy romance and melody That's what the fiddles are playing And sing and be gay as you swing For it's one hour of bliss and a passionate kiss And farewell to gypsy romance and melody Gypsy romance! Gypsy romance! Then farewell to gypsy romance and melody And sing and be gay as you swing For it's one hour of bliss and a passionate kiss And farewell... to gypsy romance and melody! Hey! Hey! Hey! Ha, ha, ha! Turn around. Hello, honey! Don't honey me, you big bag of suet! l told you five minutes ago not to talk to me. And an hour ago! And a week ago! You told him a year ago too, didn't you? You shut up when l'm talking to my husband! You think you can contradict everything l say. Well, you can't and you never will! You think you're a big man, don't ya? Don't ya? Don't ya? Don't ya? Tell her yes. You keep out of this, woodpecker! Oh, my love! Are you going to let her talk to you like that? Never! A thousand times, never! Oh, my love! l am so content and happy when l'm with you. Just like a nestling dove. You're so big and strong and brave... Pardon the intrusion but l don't like you talking to me like that in front of my friend. lt's most embarrassing. Ooh! What'd she say? What do you mean, ''talking to me like that''? l didn't mean anything, honey. lt was his fault. Oh... So, it was your idea? Control yourself! l understand perfectly... Ooohhh! l'm not gonna say anything until l get positive proof but l saw Devilshoof kissing your wife. Ridiculous! Do you believe me or believe what l see? - Nothing of the kind! - Go look for yourself. Well? There was nothing to it. They were just having a little innocent fun. Don't you understand that a man to be married nowadays must be broad-minded? - Did you see him chuck her under the chin? - Well, what of it? lf she was my wife, l'd chuck her under the wagon! l wouldn't stand... What are you trying to do? Cause a rift in my matrimonial bonds? ..valleys and hills Where the sweetest buds grow And the waters are real And the purest that flow Come we, come we, come we... Come we... Here From the valleys and hills Where the sweetest buds grow And the water are real And the purest that flow Come we, come we Come we, come we Come we, come we Come we Come... Come... Gypsy vagabonds are we Free as anyone can be lt's the gypsy life for me The life that gives us life to lead! The moon is very good to us tonight. The village will be in darkness and the pickings will be easy. Splendid! Off with the rogues, that they may fill their purses and replenish our coffers! What l wouldn't give to go with them! So black as we work and believe we'll be Finding darkness shortly Meanwhile, until the moon goes Walk on down, on we go... Don't make a sound... Nine o'clock and all is well! Nine o'clock and all is well! Nine o'clock and all is well! Nine o'clock and all is well! Nine o'clock and all is well! Nine o'clock and all is well! Nine o'clock and all is well! - Could you tell us the time? - Well, certainly. Hold my bell. Should be...just exactly...nine o'clo... Say, what did you ask me the time for? l've been yelling it all over the village. lt's nine o'clock and all is well. Nine o'clock and all is well! And has this been a happy day for you? Yes, my father. Please tell me what is this. That, my darling, is a medallion that belonged to your great-great-grandfather who founded the House of Arnheim. Please, may l wear the medallion? Why, of course you can, sweetheart. But you must be careful not to lose it because it's very, very precious to me. Throw up your hands! - You cursed gypsy! - You swine! Hello, strangers! What are you doing in the village? We're gypsies trying to make an honest living. - Gypsies, eh? Can you tell fortunes? - He can't but l can. Good! There's a couple of things l'd like to know. And if you could tell me, l'll pay you well. All right. Your eyes are the windows of your soul. And to know all, l must touch your eyes. Watch closely. Close your eyes slowly. Slowly... Slowly... Slowly... Shut! Well, what do you see? l see a long woman and a dark journey. That's all l see. Ah, piffle! ''A long woman and a dark journey''! l wouldn't give you one ducat for a fortune like that! What you mean is a long woman with a tall journey. Splendid! l shall try that. Good evening, sir. We're gypsies earning an honest living by telling fortunes. - May we tell yours? - You may. My motto is ''live and let live''. Thank you, sir. Now, you see, your eyes are the windows to your soul. And to know all, l must touch them. Now, watch closely! - Well, what do you see? - Er, l see... Er... Ooh! - You better show me that again. - Well, it's simple. You do like this, then you do like that, then you take his purse like that and that's the way it's done. l see. lnstead of doing that, l do this. - Then l take his purse and l... - lnstead of that, you do this. And... Why, you little thief! Come on, get along! Good evening. Ah. Good evening. We're gypsies earning an honest living by telling fortunes. - May we tell yours? - l should be delighted. You know, those of us who are more fortunate should help those in distress, - don't you think? - Yes, madam. Your eyes are the windows to your soul. - ln order to know all, l must touch them. - Oh! What a novelty! Watch closely! Close your eyes slowly. Slowly... Slowly... Slowly... Shut! What is my fortune? Once upon a time, there was a little girl by the name of Red Riding Hood... who had a very, very sick grandmother. So Red Riding Hood's mother sent her with a great big basket to take to the grandmother. So the wolf knew it and ate the grandmother up and she went to the house and knocked on the door and this voice...told her... Said, ''Come in!'' And you know what they said? He said that... Now, you scurvy knave, give back everything that you've taken. Come, come. - This belongs to me! - Regardless of that. Now, then, hurry. - Give the gentleman back his valuables. - l can explain! l saw the whole thing with my own eyes. - You don't realise... - Quiet! Do as l say! - There! - ls that all? No, sir. That's my watch! - His watch? - Quiet! - And my diamond studded case. - lt's a... - Silence! - And this! - None of these belongs to... - Anything else? - Yes, my rings! - Come on, hand them over! - l've never been so embarrassed! - Anything else? Oh, yes! l almost forgot my lorgnette! Oh, and my cane! His...? - Come on. - Just a moment, Officer. Just a little...offering a gift, here. A small stipend. - Thank you! - One more little detail. - My pistol. Can't do without that! - Pardon me. - lt's quite all right. - My solicitor shall hear of this! Well, Stanley, a very profitable evening! - A little refreshment? - That's a good idea. Come, Stanley. - Good night... Oh! - Good night. l-l beg your pardon. Why don't you be careful? Oh, well, that's different! Thank you, Stanley. - Yes, sir? - Two tankards of your rarest vintage. - And put a wallop in it. - Yes, sir. Come, come, my man! Hurry! Look! lt's a good thing we got his cane. Come on, hurry up, hurry up! - Two tankards of our rarest vintage. - Right away! Thank you. Give it to me. Give me all of it! Why should l? lt's as much yours as mine. All right, l'll play you for it. - What? - l'll play you fingers. - What's ''fingers''? - lt's very simple. You put your fist up like that. Then you put out some fingers. lf you put out the same amount of fingers that l do, you win. And if you don't put out the same amount of fingers, you lose. - All right. - May the best man win. Ready? Oh, no! l'll tell you what we'll do. - We'll play this time ''winner take all''. - All right. A gentlemen's agreement. Ready? Aha! Aha! Oh-ho... Count Arnheim orders you and your cursed gypsies to be on your way by noon. Tell Count Arnheim the cursed gypsies'll be away from here long before that! Pah! Ahem! Curse you, Count Arnheim! For every whip stroke you have bestowed upon my beloved, may you suffer a year of woe. Look! Count Arnheim's only child! Only child...? - Give me a part of that banana. - Huh? Give me a part of the banana. Arline! Arline? Arline! Oop! Oh! Oh! Oh! There, run and play. Hmm. Nobody will ever recognise her now. Good. But how will you account for her to your husband? Have no fear. He'll believe anything l tell him. He must never know who she really is. lf he suspected anything, he and that nitwit henchman of his would tell it to the whole world! Don't worry, my precious. l can handle them. - Good morning! - Good morning. Hurry up and get that fire going! All right, dear. - Hello! - Hello. - Where do you live? - ln there. lsn't it that nice? Hey! What? - Er... Whose kid is that? - lt's none of your business. What do you mean? l demand to know who she is. Well, if you must know, she's yours. Mine? Why didn't you tell me before? Because l didn't want her to know who her father was till she was old enough to stand the shock. Come here, dear. Come up. That is your father. Stanley...congratulate me! - What for? - l have just become a father. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - When did this happen? - Just a minute ago. Well, blow me down with an anchovy! - Darling, meet your uncle Stanley. - How do you do, Uncle Stanley? l'm pleased to meet you. Well, Oliver, l hope you grow up to be as good a mother as your father. - Thank you, Stanley. - Have a cigar. Thank you again. Have a cigar? - What's this for? - Oliver's just had a baby. - Congratulations! - Thank you. Come, Stanley, we will spread the glad tidings to the world! - My love, what has happened? - l'm leaving this camp forever. - You mean...? - l shall never see you again. - But where will you go? - What does it matter? Since l was a boy, l've had no other roof but the stars. l've been free to come and free to go. - And l give my love to whom l fancy. - But what will happen to me? Well, other lips And other hearts Their tales of love shall tell ln language which itself imparts Just how they feel so well There may, perhaps, in such a scene Some recollection be Of days that have more happy been And you'll remember me That you'll remember You'll remember Me Oh, Devilshoof, l couldn't possibly go on here without you! Take me with you! That is impossible! l have nothing. My horse, the clothes l stand in... lf we only had a little money. Some jewels, perhaps... Then, it would be different. - You mean you would take me with you? - Gladly, my love. Him! He shall be the one to get me everything! Everything! Wait and see, my Devilshoof! Hello, Stanley, dear! What are you doing? - l'm making myself a malted milk. - Oh! How long does it take? - About 15 minutes to a quarter of an hour. - Really? And l can do it much faster if l'm not interrupted. Oh! That's all right, Stanley dear! You know, accidents will happen. - You're not mad at me? - Why, certainly not! Why should l get mad at you? You know, l like you a lot better than l used to. Can't you tell? Stanley, darling, from now on, everything is going to be different. l'm going to be very, very nice to you. - Are you going to be nice to Oliver too? - l'm going to be more than nice to Oliver. l'm planning a big surprise for him. And if you will help me, l know it would please him very much. - What do l have to do? - Shh. Listen... Now, listen. You go into the wagon and get my clothes and all the money and jewels that Oliver has and hand them to me. - What do you want them for? - Ah, that's the big surprise. - Do you think you can do it? - Why, that's easy. Oh, but be careful that he doesn't see or know what you are doing. Don't worry about me. l could gyp that gypsy anytime! He's so dumb, he's thicker than mud. Oh, Stanley, you're a darling! - He's fast asleep. - How do you know? He's got his mouth open. Where does he keep his money bag? Usually under his pillow! - Just what are you looking for? - Have you got a match? Have l got a...? Get outta there! So you were looking for a match, huh? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? After all l've done for you! l took you out of the gutter and gave you a career. Made a first-class pickpocket out of you. And this is your gratitude! lt hurts, Stanley. l tell you, it hurts. We were only trying to surprise you! You surprised me, all right. But thank Heaven l saved you from yourself. l not only hid my valuables but l hid yours as well. And l hid them right here! - Well, what news? - The men we sent out have returned. l regret to report the search has proved futile. Then there is nothing more you can do. Now... What are we going to use for a nightie? Hold your arm out. That's it. Now, we'll just slip this right over your head. Put your hands in there. That's it. Just a minute, now. Down like that. Then we'll button this up to protect your little neck. So you won't get cold. That's it. Now, let's see how that looks. Oh! Ha ha! Come on! - Come in! La, la la la la la la, la-la-la La, la la la la la... Hello, Ollie. Do you know that you've got a nice voice? l had a much nicer voice till l ran a nail through it... You ran a nail through it! Let me hear you sing that again. Da, da, daaaa! Da, da, daaaa! Da da da da da da da...! - Now l've torn it. - Say good night to Uncle Stanley. - Good night, Uncle Stanley. - Good night. Er... What's her name? That's right, we haven't got a name for her. What can we call her? Why don't you call me Arline? There's a good idea, why don't we call her Arline? lf l don't want to, why should l call her Arline? Because that's my name. ls that so? Well, that's a pretty name. - lsn't that funny? - Let's go to bed. Not before l say my prayers. All right. Now l lay me down to sleep, l pray the Lord my soul to keep. lf... lf... lf... What's next? lf at first you don't succeed, try, try... try again. lf at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again. - Amen. - That's right. That's fine. ''Try, try again''! Oh! Gonna give me a big kiss? That's the way! We get right down in there. We put the cover right around there. Now, good night! La, la la la la la la, la la la... La, la la la la la la, la la la... La, la la la la la la, la la La la la, la la la, La laaaa! Da, da, daaaaa, da, da...! Shh! Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! - Good morning, Arline, dear! - Get up, lazybones! - Breakfast is ready! - We're coming. - You should've been up hours ago! - Well, l didn't know... - Morning, Arline. - Morning, Uncle Stanley. - Good morning, dear. - Good morning, Daddy dear. How did you sleep, Daddy dear? l slept like a top. And how did you sleep, Stanley? l slept like a top, too. - How did you sleep, dear? - Marvellously, Daddy. l had such a wonderful dream. There were castles and palaces and l... l was a princess. A princess? l dreamt l dwelled ln a marble hall With vassals and serfs at my side And of all who assembled Within those walls That l was the hope and the pride l had riches All too great to count And a high ancestral name But l also dreamt Which pleased me most That you loved me still the same That you loved me, you loved me Still the same That you loved me You loved me Still The same l dreamt that suitors sought my hand That knights upon bended knee And with vows No maiden heart could withstand They pledged their faith to me And l dreamt that one of that noble host Came forth my hand to claim But l also dreamt Which charmed me most That you loved me still the same That you loved me, you loved me Still the same That you loved me You loved me Still The Same l have never heard of such a beautiful dream. - Sit down and have your breakfast. - l've had mine hours ago. Wasn't that lovely? Of all the greedy things! What did you want to eat all the breakfast for? - l didn't want it to go cold. - Didn't want...! l didn't know how long she was going to dream and.... Daddy, l'm going to the village. All right. - Goodbye. - Arline! Haven't you forgotten something? What? - Of course. Goodbye, Daddy dear. - Goodbye, sweetheart. You too, Uncle Stan. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Get some hot water and help me clean these dishes. - Haven't you forgotten something? - Huh? Haven't you forgotten something? Get me the dish pan! You clean up the wagon, l'll do this! - Ollie... - What? - What about this wine? - What about it? lt's fuzzling. Look. So it is. lt needs bottling. You get some bottles and bottle it. - Where are the bottles? - You'll find some under the wagon. - Where are you going? - l'm going to take my zipper lessons. - Oh. - l won't be back until late this afternoon. While l'm gone, please don't get into any mischief. Uh-uh. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. The heart bowed down by weight of woe To weakest hope will cling Will seize the happy face of a child And by its charm is beguiled Oh, destiny's tide Has long since taken her from my side The dream as it flows tenderly by May bring a tear to the eye But memory is the only friend That grief can call its own That grief can call lts own That grief Can call lts own Well! What are you doing here? - You're a thieving gypsy! - Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! - Throw her in the dungeon! Away with her! - l'm not a thief, sir! l'll show you what we do with thieving gypsies here. - Enter. l have captured a gypsy in the grounds whom l have thrown in the dungeon. Let him remain there until l find time to witness the lashing. - But, Your Highness, it is a woman. - Nevertheless, she shall be lashed. Stan! Stan! Stan! Stan! Stan! Arline's in terrible danger! She's been captured and thrown in the dungeon! We gotta rescue her! - You're guzzled! - Oh... Nothing of the kind. l... You would do this just when l need you most! Pull yourself together. We've got to go and help her. Go on, get out! ..when the call of the bugle we hear And once we have started, we never get through Till we turn to present the platoon At the drop of a hat from our master and lord We are off to defend him with the sword With a song on our lips as we tramp, tramp along... - Shh! Quiet! lf they catch us here, it'll cost us our lives! - Psst! Arline! - What are you doing here? - We'll get you out. - Please be careful! - Uncle Stanley's going to help and we'll have you out in a jiffy. Good! Would you keep quiet?! Ooh-ho-ho-ho-ho! Get out of the light. l can't see! That's better. Why don't you try the door? That's a good idea. lt won't be long now, dear. - Shh! - Shh! That's wonderful! Where'd you get the keys? Ohh! Oh, please! - You cursed gypsy! - Please! Now, me proud and hearty beauty, your time has come! Come on! So! You tried to make me look a bigger fool than l am, huh? Oh! My good eye! Seize him! Seize him! Stan! Stan! Stan, come over here! Stan! Stan! Stan! Stan, get us out of here! Surround the castle! They must be taken! Take those two raggamuffians to the torture chamber! - No, they didn't do anything...! - And as for you, my fair lady, you come with me! - l didn't do anything! - You will be lashed! Give me this! Take it away! Tie her to the post! Prepare her for the lashing! l haven't done anything! Let me go! You're a gypsy! Lash her! Stop! Arline! My child! Get in there! Oh! Get...! Oh! Hey! Ohh! Stanley, do something to help me! Stanley! Those are the people who befriended me and loved me. You must save them! Release the prisoners! D'oh! Oh!
