He submitted a petition. "FIVE TIGERS PLAY WITH A LIFE AND WALK THE WORLD. IF YOU RELEASE OUR LEADER, I WILL SET YOU FREE." Mr. Zhang asks you to come up for questions. Shunt aside, you people, shunt aside. Mr. Zhang, would you please get out of the sedan? "BUDDHIST SCRIPTURES PAVILION" Spill it out! Where is our leader? What are your Yamun going to do with our boss? Talk! Execute him according to the law. Stop hitting him! Please write a letter to Master Zhi Jun. If he would release our leader, we would set you free. Then neither side suffers a loss. L... I am in charge of criminal law. I can't play the law with my own safety. Master Zhi Jun, who is the Governor of the State of Two-River, he won't be threatened by your bandits. Either kill me or keep me. It's up to you. Zhang Buqing, the Governor of the State of Two-River, is your dad. I cannot believe he'd keep his governor position rather than his son. My father enforces the law strictly. He will never exchange the hostage with your bandits. I urge you to start with a clean slate and release me immediately. I won't mind... whether you treat me good or bad. You are going to die, still bragging. - Lao San. - Hmm? Write a letter to his father. Ask him to have a messenger come here and settle the exchange of them. Yes. If we do not get feedback after five days, we will kill his son first, then burn out his capital of the State of Two-River afterward. If he sent soldiers here, we would be in trouble. We have his son as the hostage, I doubt he dares! We are not afraid he sends his soldiers, but we are afraid he sends his Gold Swallow. Yeah. What is the background of the Gold Swallow? We were defeated at his hand last time. All right! It is just the time to meet him. - Waiter. - Coming. What would you like to eat? from tiger bone and paw paw. Tiger... Liquor made from tiger bone and paw paw? - Do you have it? - No, sorry. Then give me 5 ounces Shao Dao Liquor and two dishes. Yes, coming. Swink! We followed her all the way, just herself. Are you the reasonable people? That's my order! Drop your hand! What are you doing? See? What should we do? Waiter, where is my liquor? Uh, coming. - Thank you! - You are welcome! Young brother, what's your business? I serve as the staff in the capital of the State of Two-River. Oh, officer! Pardon me, pardon me! What is your business here? To talk to you! Do you know me? You are the Smiley Face, Backbone Hu. Good eye! Did you write this letter? Ha, you can be sure it was written by me. But the details... should be reported to you in person. I'd like to hear the details. We have Zhang Buqing's information. I am here for it. That's great. Our leader is imprisoned in the jail of the State of Two-River. We've pleaded for Master Zhi Jun to show mercy and to exempt our leader from the death penalty. We will release Mr. Zhang immediately. And if he doesn't? If not, one life for one life: We break even. Well, the crime of your leader is even bigger. Please, let's not talk about it. Will you ever release our leader? He has done all kinds of evil, and he must be executed. Don't you forget, Zhang Buqing is the dear son of Master Zhi Jun. Also my dear brother. Since things are like this, we cannot talk now. Think it over, eh? How's the thing going? Motherfucker! Let's kill her. White-eye Wolf, hand over a jar of liquor! Okay! Here you are! What's that, Abacus Man? You're drunk already without drinking? - You should buy us meals. - Right, I should. Take it! Don't just stand there. Let me give you a bench. Let me! If you guys do not buy us a meal, I will. Oh, I'd like to join you. Hey, buddy, should not our money be returned to me? Here you are! Gold Swallow! That's me! - Let me toast to you. - I don't dare take it. I know you are a clever person. The trick is done. Let's talk about the business. We'd like to hear your idea. Let me bring you people to justice, as well as bring back Mr. Zhang to Capital. I will ask Master Zhi Jun to punish you people lightly. Have you heard? All right, only if you can. Does that mean you don't want to listen to me? We'll listen to you, but you have to follow us to see our boss. I will go when it's time. We need you go now. My hand, my hand! Open the door! The bottom, the bottom! Open the door. Mama. What are you doing here? Buying liquor. Come back later, come back later. I'm addicted. I can't wait. Okay, get in. Squat, squat. Do not move around. Waiter, give me the bill. Coming. Hi, buddy. What is happening here? Mind your business. Get out of here, get out of here. - It's a rainstorm, how can I go? - Go. I'll pay the bill for this, brother. Thank you, thank you! He has no way out today. - Young sir, you... - Shunt aside! - That was close just now. - Get away from me. You, Zhang, you went too far. - Do it, Lao San. - Get away from me. - Storekeeper. - Yes. - Give me a clean room. - Oh. I stay here. Young sir, it won't cost too much. Buy me two horses with the extra money. I come here by myself, I go back as two people. Show me the room. Please. Well, I, Lao San, failed you today. We will see. Smiley face, go back to have a talk. I would like to hear back from you within five days. Let me tell you again, if you do not release our leader within five days, I will kill Zhang Buqing. Right, Lao San, do not let him get away. Shut up! Looks like this young guy has a few tricks. I am afraid he'll find this. That means he walks into the trap. Go ahead, have some food. Sir, you hide Zhang Buqing here. If anything comes up, I cannot take it. Shut up your mouth. All right, all right. But I am the head of this temple. You people stay here... We are not here for you! I know, I know. But Master Liao Kong is not here. He, when the hell will he be back? He said he was off to look for somebody, and would be back in three to five days. Please, everyone, don't do a thing before he comes back. In case the capital of the government... Don't move. Wait a second. He is the monk in the front yard. What happened to you? What happened to you? Sir, help him, hurry up, hurry up! Useless. The needle is toxic. Sir, give him mercy with some antidote. You, extricate him. You, you... you people are too ruthless. You have been told many times, do not let your apprentices come to this courtyard. If there is a next time, it will be your turn. - Lao Wu. - Yes. A long delay may cause trouble. Later, you bring two buddies to kidnap that young guy here from High Mountain Inn. Yes. Who is there? It's... It's me. What are you doing here? I cannot sleep. Why don't we have a drink? Are you drunk? - No. - Get out! My room is leaking. If you don't mind my dirt, let me spend one night here. You! I am out, I am out! I am out. I saw you were fighting today. Do not hit me. If you hit me, I will just die here. Then get out! - Okay, okay! I'll go, I'll go. - Get out! The good intention does not have a good return. Hey, you, give my thing back to me! Coming. Too bad... empty. Hide.

We wasted a half day singing. The money wasn't enough even for a drink. That makes me not drink today. Can we have soy sauce-cooked pork and pancake to eat today? - You, greedy mouth. - I want it, too. Stop it. All right! We will eat soy sauce-cooked pork and pancake. - Waiter. - Yeah, coming. Drunk Cat, what would you like to order today? A dish of soy sauce-cooked pork and ten pieces of pancakes. Uncle, do not listen to him. Give us some steamed bread with pickled radish and 5 ounces liquor. No, forget about the liquor. Do not worry about it. You have credit. Uncle, we haven't paid back the debt yet. No more debt. Well, good boy. Senior! Yeah? I have been lucky from your help. I appreciate it a lot. What do you thank me for? Is it enough? I think it is. Good thing you pulled me out last night, or I would have been dead by the plot of the mobster. I was drunk yesterday. Should we eat noodles with soybean paste? Okay, good, good. Could you please tell me your name? My name is Drunk Cat. Wait, wait, we must eat noodles with soybean paste. Yeah, okay, good... Hey, do you have money? - Money? - Yeah. - I have, I have. - Ah! - Would you like to buy me a drink? - No problem. No, wait. I do not want your money for nothing. I can sing for you. If my singing is good, you can pay me more. Otherwise, just pay me a little. Wait! Be quiet, be quiet. Stand as one line. Be ready. Please have a seat. On the high mountain There is an evil gang They are the mobsters Grab under the sky And hide it underneath And hide it underneath Do not want gold, do not want silver Just want the crown to be returned to the folks And the Capital of governor gives up the wealth Swallow flies singly To the hill height The swallow flies singly to the hill height Senior. Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet. Senior. Be quiet, be quiet. Oh, yeah, thanks to the young sir. Thank you, sir. Go, you all have a seat over there. Go over there. I am going to order. Since senior knows my thing, please give me a hint. - What are you talking about? - I am talking about... Senior! Storekeeper, let me pay back the old debt, and save the rest in my account. Wait, you met a patron today. Was I? - Senior. - Yeah? Mr. Zhang is missing, and I am burning with impatience. Senior must know where they hide Mr. Zhang. You are still young, why are you so wordy? I only want the help of a clear direction. I am still walking in the dark. Why are our dishes not here yet? Hold, hold, hold, hold! One point and one across long One is cast aside to Nanyang One rock is to one rock The sun is to the moon One point and one across long One is cast aside to Nanyang One rock is to one rock The sun is to the moon "TEMPLE" Thank you. Miss, be very careful in the temple. Yeah? Why? Never mind, never mind. Miss, you pray to the mud Buddha... not as good as to ask me, the live deity. I will answer you if you ask me. Miss, do not hurry to go. Let's have some vegetarian food later. We are unknown to each other. Please show some self-respect. Gold Swallow, you should have known me. Hao Zhubang, I've been looking for you. You damsel, I failed at your hand last time. You have nowhere to run today. Good, you all are here. Stop! This is Buddha's temple, the pure place. How dare you kill them randomly. I am on a mission to capture the fleeing criminal. Miss, Enemies should be the suitable solution, not the suitable entanglement. Why don't we have a drink and talk it out? Mind your own business. You have colluded with mobsters, and you will be on the list as well. Don't you care about your brother's life? Who are you? What a pity for your charming eyes. How can you not recognize me? Are you Sleek-face Yan Zhongyun? Would you mind to have a talk aside? I've heard you have a brute heart and have done all kinds of evil. But if you'd like to thoroughly clean your misdeeds up, and come with me to close the case, I'd ask mercy for you from Master Zhi Jun to punish you lightly. Your pretty face has such value. She can have me punished lightly. Thank you for your deep affection. Don't you forget, I have your brother. Sooner or later, you will be in my hand, too. Nonsense. You don't understand you are heading to your death. Come on up! Are you really going to do this? Let's do it. You all get away. Good, I take off my clothes to play with you. - After her! - Let's go! She cannot go far. Go to pick her up from the woods a moment later. Over there! There! You woke up? Go lie down. You... What's wrong with you? You... You put me here. You, what do you want from me? Why don't you call me Senior anymore? Good, the graveyard became a vegetable garden. It's even. Sometimes you cannot make it right or wrong. You are not worth the Senior title. You... You are surely a drunk cat. The words from Drunk Cat haven't been wrong. Told you to watch more and act less. You haven't followed. You even fought with them with your so-called monkey boxing. Haven't you suffered losses? You haven't been good up to this point... temperament and nonsense. Come here. Let me draw out the toxic pus for you. Don't you care for me? The toxic needle shot her. She should have been faint within a half hour. We have searched all of the woods and the villages nearby. Nebbish! You people were badly battered by a damsel. You would be such a shame if it were spread out. If she is caught by me, I will... Don't give me your bullshit! Lao Wu, bring your people to find her. If you cannot make it, never come back! Well, well... Too bad. Miss Zhang, it's been too late, and I have to suck the toxin out. Done. Drunk Cat, you are so lucky in love. Everyone, please have a seat inside. Don't bother. You take advantage of my helplessness. What kind of men are you? Look, look, look, we are here to visit you. Why do you say things like that? You guys take Miss back to our place. How dare you! Wu Ye, she hasn't been well. Pity her, please. There is no place for you to bark. - Get out of my way. - Don't move. You motherfucker! Get out! Let's go inside. You all seem tired of living! What are you doing here? I am here to send the corpses to you. - Corpses? - Yeah. Please take over. What? - Who told you to bring this here? - Give me some money. Say it! Not big deal. Such a hot day. I've been on the road for over 10 miles. Say it! Where have you found these corpses? In the woods. How did you know to take it here? I knew Wu Ye. What else did you see in the woods? I saw a young girl fighting with Wu Ye. - A young girl? - Yeah! What else did you see? Talk! I was passing by the woods and saw them fighting with the young girl. That young girl moved like this. They were all dead. During that, I was shocked like a blockhead. Well, it's her. She asked me to send the corpses to you. She said that you at least would reward me $5.00. I have no idea... Wait. I'd reward you $5.00, but what did she tell you? Thank you! She said... She said the toxic needle was not very fierce. She'll be all right. Don't worry about her. Hold on. What else did she tell you? She... She said... She said... she's called Swallow. Oh, yes, she said she had a deal with you. If you have any answers, just tell me. - I am leaving. - Go, go, go. You can unload the corpses. Drunk Cat, take me to see her. She said that she'd meet me tomorrow morning. Where? She did not say. She said that she'd find me. Lao San, watch him closely, and drive those little beggars out of here. All right. - I haven't had any food yet. - Shut up. Go feed him, and have Zhi Neng Monk pray for Lao Wu's soul out of purgatory. Hey, San Ye, what is the deal the young girl talking about? Just take your drink and mind your business. All right. San Ye, Master Liao Kong has come. Er Ye asked you to welcome him. Yeah. Watch him. Let him sleep but not run away. Got it. - Don't touch it. - Okay. It's too hot. Can I borrow a hand-fan? Just follow the order and don't touch it. All right, all right. I'm putting it down. Just now, San Ye went to welcome Master Liao Kong. Who is he? You don't know him. Shut up. All right. What kind of wound did Lao Wu have on his body? His body has been pierced as a round hole, and it was not like hit by a sword. Well. Open the casket and inspect the body. What? This wasn't done by the young girl. What do you mean? The beggar, is he holding a bamboo pole with a hanging gourd? That's right. I got him without a penny. Do you know him? I was out just to search for him. Does Master have a history with him? He's my younger brother from Kong Fu League. Sorry I snubbed him just now. Seems he isn't a Kong Fu guy. His skill has reached the pinnacle. But compared to me, he is still short a little. Then what should we call him? He is called Fan Big Drunk because he loves to drink and plays the fool all the day. Some nonsense people call him Drunk Hero. The five bodies were all killed by him. We might have misunderstood him. Misunderstood? The moment our Head Master died, he stole his Green Wand, the treasure from our ancestor, and called himself the leader. I am tasked by our Head Master to kill him the scum and take back the Green Wand. - Where is he? - In the back palace. Get him. Hey, what happened to you? Where is the beggar? Talk! Run away. He has nowhere to run. Senior, have yourself some food. Since the moment you've come back from the temple, you have sighed a lot. I realize you must have a difficulty. You have done me a huge favor. I don't want to give you a hard time. I will deal with it myself. You have no way to deal with it. Come here. Go to take that rock. No, the bigger one. Hit my head with that rock. What? Come on. Hit me. Hit me with another one. This time, hit me through a higher path. Are you all right? It's my doomed fate. What? What did you say to Sleek-face in the temple today? My big brother from Kong Fu league, Diao Jintang, is the Monk Liao Kong. Can you ask him to help my brother out? We are from the same league, but we are enemies. He wanted to have the Green Wand and be the leader, so he killed our Head Master secretly. If we see each other, we will fight to the end. How has he colluded with Sleek-face? He's always done evil things outside and hidden it from the Head Master, so they both meet the evil minds. Then we should catch both of them and execute them for the people. His Kong Fu has reached a high degree of perfection. I am afraid I am not good enough to beat him. He... He has done one good thing for me. Ten years ago, I was an orphan wandering in the street. Diao Jintang brought me to our Kong Fu Master. Because of it, I haven't confronted him. Well... please leave my thing alone, I will figure something out. Miss Zhang, wait for a second. The only way is that you go back to Governor and borrow the criminal to redeem Master Zhang. I cannot do it, and my father will not allow it. But your father doesn't know about it. - You go borrow the criminal... - Well... I have a better idea to return this criminal to you. I send your leader to you, you give me Mr. Zhang. What do you think? If Senior would like to help, then we'd like to cooperate. All right! Where do we exchange them? Shi Zi Hill of South Mountain. When? How about tomorrow noon? Okay. Say it and mean it. Please. The blow of the rainstorm The burning under the sun... Big brother. Young brother, you still remember me. We are predestined brothers, and can't be apart from each other forever. We haven't met for couple of years. You are still a beggar. Even if the beggar has no big goal, you are more of a sinner with a cassock. The cassock is made by my many years' refining. I think it is dyed by our Head Master's blood. Where is the Green Wand? Green Wand is for the head of the League. You shouldn't ask. I stand to inherit it in the league. Why shouldn't I ask? I received orders from the late Master and took over the head position. I am managing 36 stations of Green Bamboo Leagues all over the places. If I see the evil member from our league, whether relatives or not, he has to be under the Green Wand's control. What if it's me, Diao Jintang? The Master said the time when you see the Green Wand, it's the time to end your life. Oh? Then my young brother wants to end my life? Your life pays for our Master's life. Since you have the order from Master, why do you hesitate? I couldn't forget you saved my life. You finally have a heart. Stop nagging, give me the Green Wand. I will let you live. Otherwise, we will have to fight. I can save you, or end you! Please give me three more days. You want to run away! I have answered to take Mr. Zhang back to Capital. You still mind other people's business, even if you are going to die. Please give extra accommodation, and don't butt in. I never want to meddle. Well, we will tie our thing in three days. I dare you to run away. I will wait for you for three days. Go away! Fan Hero, what do you mean? Fan Hero, you are the name of honor in the world. How can you fail to keep your oath? I have committed to somebody, and can't fail my oath. Please let me this time. Fan, I can't stand you anymore. Fan hero, we aren't going to do anything because of you. But in the future, please mind your own business. Okay, I will count your favor. I won't meddle any other time. All right! See you! Let's go! Thanks a lot! Protect the sedan. Brother, are you all right? I am all right, I am all right. Tell them if they shoot more arrows, I will kill you. Lao Er, stop shooting. You take them go other way. I'll have a look in the front. Let's go after an easy prey. Yes. You go over there. Be careful to not hurt the leader. Yes. We looked all over the place and couldn't find them. What should we do next? - Wait here. I'll go find them. - Okay. - Kill them. - Be careful! Let's go! Let's go! Let's get the prisoner cart! Stop it! Don't move! - Let's go! - Run. Chase them! Chase them! Where is the prisoner cart? Going toward the mountain. Get out of my way! Oh, my! Master, catch her! - Run! - Okay. Get out of my way! You are still young. There is no need to be ruthless. Who are you? Mind your business. Where is the beggar? You? You are Diao Jintang! Diao Hero, I think you should mind your business. I better kill you. Senior! Go with your people quickly. Young brother, have you thought this through? Big brother, I have had an idea. I demand you to quit the Green Bamboo League immediately and get out of our sight. I will forgive your old sin. Fan Big Drunk, you are dead. Run quickly. Fan Big Drunk, I have failed at your hand. Kill me or keep me. It's up to you. Don't trick me. I don't count your favor. We don't owe each other anymore. Let me tell you something. You better find some place and lie low and start with a clean slate. Or, if we meet next time, don't call my sword ruthless. What do you think? Young brother, I am going to leave. No way. Thank you, Master.
