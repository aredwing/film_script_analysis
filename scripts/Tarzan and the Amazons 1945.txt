All right, if you don't come right away, we'll leave you behind. - Are we ready to leave, Tarzan? - Leave soon. - That's what you said before. - Tarzan still say "ready soon." Maybe Jane will be in Randini before we get there. Boy glad Jane come home? I can hardly wait to see her again. Tarzan feel just like Boy. But Tarzan work, not talk. I worked too. I cleaned up the house as you told me to. And I watered the garden. I even put flowers in all the rooms... ...the way Jane likes. - Boy sweep floor? Oh, I forgot that. Well, do it right away. Hurry, leave soon. We're leaving now, Cheeta. All right then, when Jane asks for you... ...l'll tell her you'd rather stay and fish than go and meet her. So long, Buli. Cheeta! Cheeta! All right then, how big was he this time? I don't know why, Cheeta, but since you've taken up fishing... ...you've become an awful liar. Hey, cut it out, Cheeta. Boy look mad. Can't a fellow think when he wants to without being interrupted? Boy think too much. Forget to laugh. What Boy think so much about? Oh, everything. Everything Jane wrote about in her letters. Tall buildings. Trees taller. Buses and streetcars that take you anywhere you want to go. Buses never come. Streetcars always late. People get mad. I guess it will take Jane months to tell us... ...all about the wonderful things she's seen. There they go, Tarzan. Geese are flying to lake where river starts. You've never taken me hunting there. Boy big enough now. After Jane come back, Tarzan and Boy go hunting. Did you hear that, Cheeta? I got the leader. Beginners always lucky. Supposing they've flown away by the time we get back from Randini? Geese not in hurry like Boy. - Is she dead? - Girl be all right. Where does she come from? From behind mountains. Tarzan, you never told me anybody lived there. Girl not frightened, Tarzan friend. Panther dead. Others gone. Cheeta, give bracelet back to Girl. Why Girl leave Palmyria? Girl go back to people now. Ankle hurt? Tarzan take Girl back. Oh, no, you mustn't. Boy and Cheeta wait at raft. - Can't we come with you, Tarzan? - No. - But Tarzan... - Boy and Cheeta wait at raft. Tarzan back soon. I wonder why Tarzan never told us about Palmyria. Come on, Cheeta. Look, Cheeta, there's Tarzan. And I thought I'd seen everything. No, Cheeta, we'd better get back to the raft. Throughout the history of our land, our Sun God... ...strangers centering their domain... ...have ever sought to despoil Palmyrial treasures... ...we dedicate to thy glory. For the protection of us, thy servants... ...thou hast ordained... ...that all such intruders shall forfeit their lives. Grant me the strength... ...to carry out... ...this, thy sacred decree. So Athena has taken it upon herself... ...to defy the wishes of the Sun God. Forgive me, my queen, I meant no harm. I grew restless to find out what lay beyond the mountains. So restless that you forgot... ...that no one is allowed to leave or enter our sacred domain? Please spare this man's life. He saved mine. - I pleaded with him not to come but... - You need not plead for Tarzan. He is our friend. Nor should you seek pardon from me... ...but rather beg forgiveness from the sacred Sun... ...the Snake and the ever-living tree... ...for placing the safety of Palmyria in jeopardy. Queen make wise laws. Girl will obey. May the great Sun God protect you on your way, Tarzan. It was fortunate indeed... ...that it was Tarzan who found you... ...for he has known the secret of our hidden land... ...and kept it well. You know, Tarzan, if I had a boy... ...l'd want him to know everything I know. Tarzan doesn't want to hear any more about Palmyria. - But, Tarzan, l... - Boy talk too much. Boy forget about Palmyria. What's it say, Splivens? That there steamer from England docked at Saxford 11 a.m. Looks like a bit of alright, Mr. Ballister, don't it? You know, there might be some whiskey on board. And there's a party of five coming on the dinghy. - Who are they? - Archaeologists, I think. Archaeologists? - I'll settle for the whiskey. - Yes, sir. What do they think they'll find in this hellhole? If there was anything to be exploited here, I'd have done it years ago. That's right, if there was anything to be exploited around here... ...you would have done it years ago. Come back here with that mirror. Cheeta. Give it to me. Shame on you, always stealing things. Hello, Tarzan. - Thanks. - Ship come in yet? Dinghy's bringing the passengers up the river now. Good. Cheeta stay here. Boy and Tarzan go meet Jane. Come, Boy. One more bend and you'll see Randini. Glad to be home, Jane, aren't you? Is this all the speed you can get out of this ocean greyhound? She's old, ma'am. She wants to take it easy. I only hope they got word to Tarzan in time. Tarzan. Boy. My, how you've grown. Excuse me. Tarzan, this is Sir Guy Henderson. - Mr. Anders. - Glad to know you. Mr. Brenner. Mr. Lateur. And Mr. Basov. I'm very glad to meet you, Tarzan. Jane has told us so much about you that I almost feel I know you. Sir Guy was one of my father's very best friends, Tarzan. - Jane's friends, Tarzan's friends. - Thank you. Oh, I can't get over how big you are. - And I can swim as well as Tarzan now. - Really? Well, almost. I'll prove it to you. He swims like a fish. Nothing is more inaccurate than to compare... ...the aquatic locomotion of a human being with that of a fish. Hurry up, don't you ever want to get to shore? Boy, right. Boat slow. Tarzan and Jane swim to Randini. But Tarzan don't be silly. I can't swim like this. No, you don't, no, Tarzan. Make her get in, Tarzan. What a family. No, Tarzan, don't. Tarzan! When you told us about Tarzan and Boy, I thought you were exaggerating. I'm afraid I'll have to get used to this all over again. Boy good swimmer. Crocodile better. Tarzan best swimmer. There. Cheeta. Gentlemen, this is Cheeta. A magnificent specimen of chimpanzee syndactylous. The magnificent specimen seems to be allergic... ...to zoologists and taxidermists. - Hello, Mr. Ballister. - Welcome home, Jane. Thank you. I see you all arrived safely. What is it, Cheeta? What is it? Gentlemen, I'm in charge of this post. Welcome to Randini. - Thank you. - Thanks. What have you got there, Cheeta? Why, thank you, Cheeta. Oh, it's beautiful. Gentlemen... ...look at my coming-home present. Looks like coming home was worthwhile. Might I? It's beautiful. I've seen this design before, somewhere. The sun, a tree, a snake. Have you run across anything like this in your travels, Anders? Wonderful craftsmanship. No, I haven't. What does our eminent mineralogist make of it? Unalloyed gold, unquestionably. Oh, isn't it lovely? I wonder where Tarzan got it. How Jane get this? Why, Cheeta gave it to me. - I thought it was from you. - Cheeta. Where does the bracelet come from, Tarzan? Can it possibly be the work of a native tribe? - Jane, Tarzan go home now. - But, Tarzan... Sun getting low in sky. Jane come with Tarzan. I don't understand. There must be something wrong. Don't worry, Jane. Jane. Well, goodbye, gentlemen and good luck. Goodbye. Basov, be a good chap and get me the case... ...with the reference books, will you? - Gladly, sir. This is it. "Vase. Exact origin unknown... ...believed to have originated with an obscure tribe... ...in the interior of Africa. Composition: cloisonn and unalloyed gold. Date unknown. Owner, British Museum." The sun, a tree, a snake... ...I knew I'd seen that design before. The design is identical. Can you throw any light on this, Mr. Ballister? Ever since I took over this post, I've heard rumors among the natives... ...about a fabulously wealthy tribe led by women. Yes, but we don't hold with fairytales like that. You keep your ugly face out of this. That's right. I investigated thoroughly... ...strictly in the interest of science of course... ...but these natives are a surly and superstitious lot. Yes, and that ain't the half of it. You say these rumors indicate the tribe is led by women? Amazons. - Amazons? - This is too good to miss. Think of it. Think what it would mean if we were the first to discover this tribe. Searching for glory, eh? You wouldn't welcome an opportunity like this? Naturally, I would. From a scientist's point of view, the discovery might be of great importance. Well, then, gentlemen, since we're all agreed. Not so fast, Mr. Ballister. This expedition was organized with the specific intention... ...of further investigating certain tribes north of the Kaisoot. So you're willing to play second fiddle to Young and Goodheart and all the others... ...when the chance to make a real discovery falls into our laps. Well, maybe Sir Guy doesn't like the idea of facing hardships. Have you any natives around here... ...who could serve as guides if we should make the attempt? Oh, I wouldn't put any trust in the natives. They're so blinking superstitious. There's only one man for this job: Tarzan. That's right. But will Tarzan tell you? He'll tell us all right. How soon can you get this safari in shape? First thing in the morning. Then, gentlemen, we better be turning in. Good night. - Good night. - Good night, sir. You won't regret it, Sir Guy, however much you scorn fame. Pure gold. Our home. Trees, bridge. Every time I wanted to be with you, I just closed my eyes and there it was. It's just the way you left it, Jane. I cleaned and scrubbed it, didn't I, Tarzan? Wait until I get my hands on you. You'll be sorry, every one of you. Come on, Cheeta. Look what they've done to my clean house. Never mind, Boy. I'll have it fixed up in no time. Very clever, these monkeys. Cheeta not nice to little cousin. - Come, Boy, lots of work. - Oh, now, never mind, never mind. You men go out and get the rest of the luggage. This is my job. Go on. I'm sure glad Jane's back. Now we're gonna have some real cooking again. Boy always say Tarzan's cooking good. Well, it wasn't so good sometimes. Tarzan bad mother, good father. Tarzan. I'm all out of breath. Jane take deep breath and close eyes. Tarzan thought Jane never come back. Being away is a lot harder than staying behind. Very lonely without you. Or without you. Jane not angry with Tarzan? No, Tarzan. Why should I be angry? Jane seemed unhappy because Tarzan took bracelet away. No, Tarzan. You must have a good reason. It was beautiful and I thought it was my coming-home present. I was just a little disappointed. - Was she pretty? - Who? The girl you rescued from the panther. Oh, beautiful. No, he wasn't quite as tall... ...and his shoulders were a little narrower... ...but he had the nicest smile. - Who? - Oh, didn't I tell you? An officer I met on the boat. Cheeta been fishing two years, no fish yet. You can keep your blasted jungle. Give me Hampstead Heath. If only 10 percent of what we heard is true, you'll have nothing to kick about. Well, I hope as how you got your information from headquarters. I only had room for a few books, so I chose them very carefully. Jane right, book only as good as what it say. I like this one best of all. Strong of arm was Hiawatha He could shoot ten arrows upward Shoot them with such strength And swiftness That the tenth had left the bowstring Ere the first to earth had fallen! Good, good. How Boy learn so quick? I just read it over a few times. Anybody could learn it. You try it, Tarzan. Swift of foot was Hiawatha Swift of foot was... - Swift of foot was... - Hiawatha Swift was... Tarzan mind not so swift. Even if you can't say it like Hiawatha, you can sure shoot like him. Forth into the forest straightway All alone walked Hiawatha Proudly, with his bow and arrows And the birds sang round him, o'er him "Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!" Up the oak tree, close beside him Sprang the squirrel, Adjidaumo In and out among the branches Coughed and chattered from the oak tree "Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!" But the part I like best of all is where he wants to kill a deer. The buck comes along... ...and Hiawatha aimed an arrow. Scarce a twig moved with his motion Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled How's about taking a snapshot of me with this here lioness, Mr. Anders? Why not? - Could I borrow that gun just a moment? - Watch it, it's loaded. This ought to make my old lady sit up and take notice. This is not my idea of sport, Mr. Ballister. Why don't we all sit down and have a good cry? I didn't do it, Tarzan. Honestly, I didn't. It was Ballister what shot it. She was about to attack. I think anyone would have done the same thing. Mother lion never attack unless somebody after cubs. The only excuse we can offer is that it was done in the excitement of the moment. Oh, Jane. Every time men bring guns, men bring trouble. We're sorry, believe me. I thought you'd planned to go north, Sir Guy. Yes, so we had, but something rather exciting cropped up... ...and we changed our plans. Suppose we all talk this over in the morning when things have calmed down. - Why men not tell why men here? - What do you mean? Men come to get Tarzan's help. It's refreshing to find someone who comes right to the point. Tarzan answer, like men say, right to the point: No. Tarzan better take cubs before cubs attack people. Well, looks like we better set up camp. All right, boys, start pitching camp. This change in your plans, Sir Guy... ...in what way could it require Tarzan's help? You remember the bracelet you received at Randini? - Yes. - A simple gold bracelet. And it's opened up a world of infinite possibilities. - What are you doing? - I'm shooting the sun. Shooting the sun? Just an expression, we are trying to find out where we are. Why? Don't you know where you are? Hey, what are you doing? Give me that. Get out of here! Go on out of here! Beat it! Now we'll see how pure it is. But you can see there's nothing in it. Boy, look. Look in here. It's all full of: Now you can see why one must be careful. What you just saw is nothing but harmless, one-cell life. Jane! Jane. You must never drink another drop of water again. - What? - You should see what I just saw. Why, it's full of terrible-looking animals. He must have looked through Basov's microscope. Darling, there are so many things you don't know. And according to Tarzan's philosophy, what you don't know won't hurt you. Believe me, Jane, if it were only for self-glory... ...it would be a different matter. But the discovery of this tribe will be a real contribution to science. Tarzan is the only man who can lead us there. You must do everything you can to make him see it our way. As a rule, it isn't a simple matter to change Tarzan's mind. He usually has a reason for his actions. I'm sure I can persuade him to see it your way, Sir Guy. - Good. - I'll try too. Oh, thank you, young man. - What's wrong? - Monkey's got a stick of dynamite. - She'll blow us all sky-high! - Cheeta! Here, Cheeta, give it to me, Cheeta. You nearly had the magnificent specimen ready for your collection this time. Yes, in small pieces. - That was a close one. - You dropped this, Mr. Anders. - Oh, thank you, Boy. - How do you work it? You come around anytime, I'll be glad to show you. - I think we better be leaving now, Boy. - Goodbye. Jane... ...we're depending on you. I developed it all by myself. Then Mr. Anders enlarged it for me. They've opened up a whole new world for you, haven't they, Boy? Mr. Anders said I could keep this until they go away. They're really powerful. Did you see what Mr. Splivens gave Cheeta? - No. - A magnifying glass. Now, what would Cheeta want with a magnifying glass? Just like he said, "I hopes as how it'll come in handy." Look how close it brings the mountains to us. But that's nothing, you ought to see Mr. Basov's telescope. It brings the sky right down to the treetops. Boy know every star in sky like friend. Yes, Tarzan, but this telescope brings them so close. - You can almost shake hands with them. - Almost. You mustn't try to discourage Boy. It may be years before anyone comes... ...who can teach him the things these friends of mine can. Friends help Boy change Tarzan's mind and lead safari. - Oh, now, that's silly. - Why men stay here then? They hope when you understand the object, you'll see reason and you'll help them. Yesterday Tarzan say no. Today Tarzan say no. - Tomorrow Tarzan say no. - Why won't you help them, Tarzan? - Not good for men to look straight into sun. - What's the sun got to do with it? Sun like gold. Too much sun make people blind. Well, now you're talking in riddles. If you could just give us one good reason for your refusal. Jane tell men Tarzan say no. All right, I'll have to tell Sir Guy that you just refuse to change your stubborn mind. - I'll come with you, Jane. - I don't think Tarzan would approve. You might be in danger of learning something. Boy, soon as men leave, Tarzan and Boy go hunting. All right, boys, lay off. We've gotta break camp. It's a blooming shame, I told youse what Tarzan wouldn't tell us. I've had about enough out of you. I must admit, it is a considerable letdown. Let me remind you, gentlemen... ...that I have no less interest in this discovery than yourselves. If anyone can offer a practical solution, I shall be glad to fall in with it. There's only one way to deal with a guy like Tarzan. Well, Sir Guy, I take it you want us to step back into obscurity. There was nothing obscure about the mission on which we came. We'll follow our original plan and go north. Boy, look, jungle water pure. No bugs. Boy look like thundercloud. Sick maybe. Leave him alone, Tarzan. He feels badly because his friends are leaving today. After safari leave, Boy will forget. Hope they forget how you treated them. Maybe Jane gone so long, forget not all men good. What right have you to judge men who are trying to do something for the world? You'd hold back the progress of civilization... ...simply because you've decided my friends aren't to be trusted. Well, I trust them. If I could think of any way to help them, I certainly would. Jane pretty when mad. Cheeta like Jane, wanna set the world on fire. Hello. Hello, Boy. We've come to say goodbye. We'll miss you, Boy. I've never had a more promising apprentice. Men wise to leave. I like you, Tarzan, but you're as immovable as the Rock of Gibraltar. It's insufferable to be on the brink of a discovery and to be turned back. Not all discoveries bring happiness. Personally, I refuse to be pacified by jungle platitudes. You must admit, the world will hardly cease to revolve on its axis... ...because of our disappointment. Get away! - Well, goodbye, Jane. - Good luck, Sir Guy. - Goodbye, Tarzan. - Goodbye. Stick to your books, my boy. He has a fine mind. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Tarangi, Tarangi, on your feet. Boy, Tarzan keep promise, go hunting now. I'm not going. Tarzan wanna see Boy shoot leader of geese. I don't wanna go. Boy wanna go before strangers came. They're not strangers. They're Jane's friends and mine. And they're leaving because of you. I don't ever wanna go hunting with you. - Tarzan, Boy, what's wrong? - Tarzan go hunting alone. Boy, what happened? Oh, nothing. Go on home, Cheeta. Leave me alone. You know, Cheeta, sometimes I can't understand Tarzan. "Boy forget about Palmyria. Not good for men to look straight into sun." Jane's right. Tarzan won't help them. I will. Come on, Cheeta. - Are you sure you know the way, Boy? - Of course I do. What puzzles me, Boy, if you knew about this all the time, why didn't you speak up? I didn't realize I was holding back the progress of civilization. Boy? Boy. There. Behind those mountains is Palmyria. But how does one ever get across? I know how. I wonder what's keeping the others so long. - You wait here. I'll see. - Thank you, Boy. Lateur, look. I stake my reputation... ...that's the orchid Ponsonby claimed to have discovered last year in Brazil. No, Mr. Lateur, don't step out there! Don't, those flowers only grow over mud pits. It's a lucky thing we have Boy to look after us. Tarangi, Tarangi, what's holding things up? That's the most cockeyed superstition I ever heard of. Who said you won't come back if you go across those mountains? You'll do as I say. - That's enough, telling them, governor. - Now pick up that stuff and get out of here. Pick up that stuff. Splivens, stop those guys. Stop! Put that gun away, Ballister. I'm in charge of this expedition. Who's going to carry all this stuff? We'll take only essential equipment. All I'll need will be my camera and notebooks. Yeah, only essential equipment. Boy! Boy! Boy! Paradise in the land of forgotten time. Get a load of that. Makes your Hampstead Heath look pretty cheap, huh? Makes you kind of goosepimply-like all over, don't it? What was lovely from afar is still lovelier nearby. - What's eating you? - Nobody home. A bit eerie, ain't it? lmagine architecture like this, here in Africa. Yeah, look at that dome. That's gold. We are friends. Our mission is a peaceful one. Odd form of welcome, huh? May we greet the ruler of this beautiful land? You and your companions were ill-advised to come here. The law of Palmyria demands the penalty of death for all intruders. We come not as intruders. But as men of science, anxious to study the ways and the culture of Palmyria. Are weapons of war implements of study? We needed these to protect us in the jungle. But we gladly place our weapons in your keeping until we leave. Ballister. You're a fool. We could have shot our way out of here. Even if you came with peaceful intent... ...how can we know that you would not spread the word... ...of our treasures to the outside world? You have only my promise, but I give it sincerely... ...that if we are allowed to leave peacefully... ...no word of what we have seen shall be passed on to a living soul. Wily old humbug, Sir Guy. Humbug me eye. He means it. The path to Palmyria is our most closely guarded secret. How did you find it? It's my fault. I led them here. Who are you? Boy, son of Tarzan. Tarzan would never betray us. Oh, Tarzan doesn't even know that I know the way. My queen... ...this boy was with Tarzan when he rescued me. Yes, and I followed them to the top of the mountain. I have grown old in the service of my people and of the great Sun God. Never before have I doubted the wisdom of his decrees... ...yet I know that he is not a god of vengeance. He would not unjustly demand the death of peace-loving men... ...of good faith and an impetuous child. Your lives will be spared. It will be difficult not to tell the world of your generosity. You will not need to suppress your impulse of gratitude. You will never leave Palmyria. A place will be found for you among the men who toil in our quarries. The remainder of your days on Earth... ...will be dedicated to the service of the God... ...who mercifully spared your lives. See that these men are sheltered in the city for the night. Jane. Boy. Jane. Boy. Tarzan! Tarzan! Jane! Riches enough to buy and sell a continent, and look at us. Held prisoners by a bunch of women. Whose habits bear a remarkable resemblance... ...to those of the black widow spider. - That's right. And we gave our guns up to them just like that. Even if we could have shot our way out, I have a curious aversion to shooting women. You may be content to spend your life... ...working for the glory of their almighty Sun God and his pet snake. But I just love the idea of being handcuffed in a gold mine until we rot to death. Cheeta, remember the girl Tarzan rescued? Go find her, bring her here. Now it is confirmed that the matriarchal society... ...can and does exist in its purest form. For heaven's sakes, what's the point of writing that when no one's going to read it? Hampstead Heath was never like this. - Why did you send for me, Boy? - You have to help us. No, no, I mustn't. I've caused enough trouble already. - You've got to. - But I can't. Tarzan saved your life. The least you can do is to help us get out of here. Cheeta, come on. I shall lead you safely past the city. You must be silent. Discovery would mean instant death. - But our weapons... - They're in the palace. You'll find them in the room behind the altar. Get them as quickly as possible. There's no time to lose. Oh, wouldn't my old lady love this? Incredible. The world won't believe me. They'll believe me all right. I'm gonna make this trip worthwhile. Here, give me a hand. I'm going to see what's keeping them. Come on, Cheeta. You greedy fools. Aren't you content to escape with your lives? Shut up that preaching. Wrap that up. I didn't bring you here to pillage like barbarians. Take it easy, Sir Guy. You'll wake up the whole neighborhood. I order you to leave everything here. We're through taking orders from you. Don't touch that, Ballister. Have you gone mad? Sir Guy! Sir Guy... Mr. Anders, come quickly. I should never have brought you here. You killed him. Now I know why Tarzan said it was not good for man to look straight at sun. Stop sniveling. Get in there and help carry some of that stuff. Get going. - Pick that up. - I won't. Better do as he says. And be quick about it. You can go on your feet. Duck, Mr. Splivens. We'll never hold them back with one rifle. Looks like our number's up. Oh, no, it ain't. Come on. On your feet, chappy. - I'm all right, go ahead. - Hurry up, Splivens! Look out, Mr. Splivens! Mr. Splivens. Mr. Splivens. Mr. Splivens! At noon the sun rising over the eastern mountains... ...will fully cover his own image with celestial light. It is then that you will repay him with your life. Boy. - Boy. - Boy all right. Jane not worry. Why, it's Cheeta. Cheeta, where Boy? Cheeta, stay with Jane. Now has everlasting evil fallen upon us. The grass will wither... ...and the shadow of death will cover our fair land. Never to be lifted until thy sacred symbols are returned to thee. Anders, this is only the beginning. I've never seen such wealth. Now that we know the way, we'll be back. All of it can be ours. Pure gold. Look at it. That means power. Power to get anything you want. Where's Boy? Where's Boy? Boy! Tarzan. Jane! Jane! Boy! Oh, darling. Thank heaven you're both safe. Throw it, Tarzan. Quick!
