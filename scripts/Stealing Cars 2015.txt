Hello. Hi. How are you? Fine. You? Fine. Good! Where's the gate? Bye. Bye. You know, when Sonny gets an idea in his head... he's just a mad man. I thought he was gonna kill me. Attica! Whoo! - You're Billy's sister, right? - Yeah. You seen him around? - Oh, Ollie. - Speak of the devil. Yeah. Come on, man. I told you, not here. I'm sorry, man. - I forgot what you said. - All right. Hey, go see Dad, yeah? William Wyatt. My name is Conrad Sean Lewis. You will call me Mr. Lewis. And the uncles, the aunts, the cousins... nieces, the nephews that lived in those walls. A gibbering pack of tree apes that said nothing, nothing, nothing... and said it loud, loud, loud. Let me be the first to welcome you to the BCFB. After you. There's a new guy. You're in luck. You're just in time for dinner. Table 4, Elvis. Stand up, new boy. Stand up. Ooh... Were you eyeballing me, new boy? I don't know, but I don't think I was, sir. Did I say you could talk? - You kind of implied permission, sir. - What? The implication was that you wanted an answer. When I want an answer, I will tell you, understood?! I just asked you a question, new boy! Certainly even you, sir, can see how confusing this is becoming. Chill, chill, chill. Lucky. You've been here exactly five minutes. That's an impressive beginning and an ominous portent of things to come. My name is Montgomery De La Cruz, the director at the Bernville Camp for Boys. I wanna welcome you. I know it might seem hollow... because there's got to be some other place you'd rather be. Isn't there? - I'm waiting. - Some other place I'd rather be... - Some places, sure. - A simple yes or no will suffice. - Yes. - Thank you. But you didn't do very well in those other places you'd rather be, now, did you? That's hard to say, sir. I haven't actually been to some of the places I'd rather be. Tough guy over here. Come with me. What made him think he can get away with this? - Get out of here, man. - Eat in silence. Now, Mr. Wyatt, you and I are gonna engage in witty byplay... but perhaps when you have a tad less energy... and not in front of the general population. Do we understand each other? I doubt it, sir. You're a very clever boy, Billy. We don't get a lot of clever boys here. I imagine you're gonna be a very refreshing challenge. But be careful. I think it was Albert Camus who said... that a man can hang himself with too much cleverness. - Yes, sir. Yeah. - We'll see you tomorrow. Ooh. Actually, it wasn't Camus who said that. It was Billy the Kid. Good night, sir. Hey, that took some balls, man. I'm Nathan Stein. Billy. - So, what did you do? - Yeah. - I burnt my parents' house down. - Oh, okay. What about you? Dope, cars, rock 'n' roll. Yeah. Dope. - You all right? - Oh, shut your mouth. Yeah. I'm the sickly one. - Every institution needs one, right? - Yeah. - I read that in the brochure. - Why don't you faggots kiss... - so we can get some sleep? - Good night, Billy. I'm sorry, man. I forgot what you said. Hey, go see Dad, yeah? Hey, it's cool, man. But I'm gonna push you a little bit for talking to my little sister. My dad's in the car over there. You got them all fooled, don't you, man? Whoa. Bet your dad's real proud of you. - Hello, Sweets. - Hello. - How are you? How was school? - It was all right. - Hey. - Hey. Everyone turn to Page 55 where we left off. Oh, wow. Page 55. You guys must have been at this for months. Shut up. "With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers... grabbers, snatchers..." Mr. Wyatt? Your first day, right? I can get you caught up if you haven't read this. Oh, I read it. Okay. Then it shouldn't be a problem for you to continue with today's reading. Please. Bring your book and come up front. Gay James Dean. "Grabbers, snatchers, fliers and swimmers... instead of examiners." Critics... knowers and imaginative creators. The word "intellectual," of course... became the swear word it deserved to be. Class, you may write "shit, yeah" in the margins. Enough editorializing, Mr. Wyatt. You always dread the unfamiliar. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal. - Yeah, because freedom can suck my... - Mr. Wyatt. Your knowledge of the book is impressive, but I'm warning you. Gentlemen. When you're ready to take this seriously, I will welcome you back. But for now, get out. - Get out, boy! Get out! - Yeah! Get out! - Oh, no, come back. - Yeah! If you all find Mr. Wyatt so amusing, all of you, get the hell out of my classroom. Come on, man. We didn't do nothing. I'm not cleaning up rocks. I understand this gathering... comes courtesy of everyone's favorite funny man. - Billy Wyatt. - What's up with this guy? Now... here's what you sweethearts are gonna do. You're gonna move all these rocks at the bottom... up there. They're in my way down here. Now, I don't know how many rocks exactly will fit up there... so it's possible a few might have to come back down. But we'll see. Maybe by then... - Billy won't seem so funny anymore. - How's this for funny? A rabbi, a priest and a hooker... Hooker.... walk into a bar. Now, the bartender, he's like, "This is a joke, right?" Oh, no, no. No. I know you're out there, Conrad. - I can smell you breathing. - Word of advice. Shut the hell up. That is four words, technically. Ooh... Damn. - Anybody else? - Damn. Hey, let me ask you something. Ask away. How'd you do that thing in class? When you looked up from your book and kept reading... - like you had it memorized. - I did, you know. I mean, I do. I have this memory thing. Eidetic memory. I'm supposed to know what that means? If I read something or see a picture of something just once... it sticks with me forever, with perfect clarity. - That's awesome. - Oh, you think so? How'd you like to have the menu of IHOP on 23rd and Broadway... dancing around in your head 24/7? Got it from my father. He has it. Bet your dad's pretty pissed at you now, huh? Yeah. Let me ask you something else, Mr. Memory. - Yeah? - What's that Greek myth... - with the guy in... That carries... - Sisyphus. - Yeah. He pushed the rock up that hill. - Great story. He carries rocks up the hill for 20 years. He got, as you can imagine, completely buff. A Greek princess falls in love with him. They get married. He mounts her atop Olympus on the hourly basis until he dies at 200... - after which, they made him a god. - Really? No. Shit. - Billy, you're bleeding. - Huh? On your back. Whoa. You fell, funny man. Go to the infirmary. I tell you what, Dwayne. I have a job. So you don't need to send me those checks... that you weren't even sending me anyway. - How long you been sitting there? - I don't know. What's wrong with you? - I got a kind of cut on my back. - Take off your shirt. Just like that? Not gonna ask me out to dinner first? At least tell me I'm pretty. - What's your name? - Billy. Nurse Simms. Now, off with that shirt, bright eyes. Oh, man. That bad? What happened? I fell. Uh-huh. We have a falling epidemic here. Just gonna clean it. Do I need stitches? I don't know. I don't think so. That's good because I hate needles. Me too. Turn around. Can you breathe okay? I don't know. Feels like I broke something. Rest. All right, so the black guys don't talk to the Latino guys. And the skinheads don't talk to the black guys or the Latino guys. And nobody talks to the crackers. - I love clichs. - Yeah. And nobody but nobody talks to me. I'll talk to you, Nathan. I'll talk your goddamn ear off. You're crazier than I thought, man. See that guy? It's Carlos Fuentes. - He's the alpha dog, El Gato. - How can he be the alpha dog... and called The Cat? His moniker contradicts his position. Because he shot a guy. In the eye. Behind a Five Guys. He shot him with a burger in his mouth. Jesus. - And they put him in here? - Yeah. Mexican Mafia. He's totally connected. That shit is far-reaching. Some kind of family thing, I think. - You got your pads on all backwards, bro. - Oh. - Thanks. Am I good? - Yeah. All right. Yo, Nathan got J.T.'s old helmet. Make him the waterboy. All right. For those of you who just recently joined the team... my name is Coach Carmichael. You might remember me from my days playing linebacker for the Eagles. All right. Football... - If he says football is a lot like life... - Football is a lot like... - I'll barf blood on his cleats. - A lot like life. You find something funny, Stein? Hm? No, sir. No. Since you like to laugh so much, maybe we crack you up officially. Dye. - Yeah, J.T. Show him what's up! - Here's your tough guy. - You ball? - I was defensive end... back at Erasmus Hall. Yeah. I broke a dude's collarbone so I got kicked off the team. Part of the game. He was our quarterback, so... Son, you got Eagle potential. A little one-on-one. See if you can blow past Mr. Dye. Run to daylight, pussy. Sir, Nathan is a pussy. He's a international pussy. He's a real-deal pussy. - I, on the other hand... - Ooh! - Damn. - Yo, that's my boy right there. Get up. Get up, son. - What'd you say? - Nothing. - Like a rag doll. - You want another one? He just said something nasty about your mama. - Ooh... - Oh, is that right? Do it again. Ooh! - Down! - Yeah, J.T. - What'd you say about my mama? - Nothing. But you hit me like that again, I might. I think I busted something. Oh... Son of a... Peas from last weekend. I bet you won't be verbing me no more. Verbing? Would that be in the eyeballing family, sir? - Do it again. - Come on, man. Do it, J.T., do it. Man. Nah, I guess I wouldn't. - Again. - Stay down. Ooh... Do it again. Ooh... Again. Ooh... Do it again. Again. Ooh... Straight embarrassing. This is getting ridiculous now, man. Do it again. Oh, man. - What are you doing? - He's done. He's done, man. Hey! Get back here! Nice hit, Mr. Dye. "Why is it," he said, one time at the subway entrance... "I feel I've known you so many years?" "Because I like you," she said. "And I don't want anything from you." You smell nice. Like morning. Don't. Okay. Whatever you did... you're too smart to be in here. You wanna talk about it? You have a first name? I sure do. You let me know if you change your mind. Come on. Coyotes singing' A song to me This one's on the nurse. Conrad. You got me the job. Lord knows I need it. And I will do it, but I will not do you. Not again. We've been down that road before, Connie. And it was a really short, boring trip. I'm not gonna listen Hey, Emmit. Dance with Conrad, will you? I don't dance. The last time I danced was with my wife... and she danced right out the door, which is where I'm headed. Y'all have a good night. Big trucks are whining On the pavement floor Damn. Take it easy. Y'all need... mm... an IHOP. No, y'all need to find another place to sit. That's what I'm saying. Y'all had an IHOP, I'd be in there having... the Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity. Instead, I got this. Bernville, in all its downtown downtrodden splendor. Where you need to be at, son? Don't get all existential on me, officer. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Where you need to be? - The Bernville Camp for Boys. - Get in the car! - Shotgun. - In the back, boy. Let me see if I got this straight. You broke out of camp tonight so that I could take you back tonight? And why, you ask? Well... why did Sir Edmund Hillary climb Mount Everest? Uh... Why do dogs lick their balls? Why did Sir Edmund lick his balls at the summit? So, what did you do to land yourself in there? Shot a man in Reno. You're a little too young to know about Johnny Cash. My dad taught me. And what does he do? Next caller, please. You may wanna die, but I don't. Put that smoke out. I suspect respect is your biggest problem, son. And if you lucky, somebody won't have to beat it into you. Now, that ain't my style. But I ain't too old to change. Get this cleaned up... and me and you gonna be okay. Yes, sir. Blow out your candle It will not... - Let's go, sweetheart. - Unh. Compliments of Mr. Wyatt's late-night outing... he will be wearing the Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo! He will wear it today, tomorrow and for as long as I say! This is not the only tuxedo I have in stock, Mr. Dye. Any one of you even think about going AWOL, Mr. Stein... I will outfit all you fish in a flash. Now, back to your spades. Spade. - Look at his eye. - Hey, yo, chill out. - Hey, Bill. - This good? Like this? Here. Uh, I stole it from breakfast. What is all this? It's the community construction program. I've been here for like two months... and nobody seems to know what the hell we're building. - Coming through, coming through. - Whose sweet ride? It's Montgomery's. It's his pride and joy. He'd have sex with it if he could. Maybe I'm giving him too much credit. - Maybe he has. - Mm-hm. You better hide that shit. Hey, if you could have sex with any car, what kind of car would it be? Phantom. But, you know, I'd be thinking about a Jag so, you know... Yeah, I know. Ahh. The fruit juice of human kindness. I want you boys to drop down and give me 50. Please and thank you very much. I'm waiting. I believe you boys were admiring my automobile? In the parlance of the street, she's cherry. Now, you guys are light years from this, but we do have a trustee program... that allows those who get in the program and stay in the program... the privilege of working on my car... and drinking lemonade as the sun sets. It's an incentive program, if you will. Mr. Wyatt, how many is that? Eight percent. I want another 50. Come on, Stein, I haven't seen you do one good one yet. Don't make me help you! - Push with your arms! - I can't. Push! Give me one fucking good one! Push! Come on, you weakling. One fucking push-up. Two... three, four. You waste of space. Push! All day! We'll do this all day! "'Everyone must leave something behind when he dies'... my grandfather said. A child, or a book, or a painting... or a house, or a wall built... or a pair of shoes made... or a garden planted." Boys... unless you wanna join him... "Something your hand touched some way... so your soul has somewhere to go when you die. And when people look at that tree or that flower you planted... you're there." Oh, wow, if it's Bernville, and it's autumn and it's after 6, ooh... don't be caught dead without the Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo. Made from the finest Dacron in Akron, rubber capital of the world. It is smart, dashing and now, the Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo. If you gotta be bad, but you wanna look good, this is the tux for you... and you, and you and you. It comes in a rainbow of colors, red, yellow, tan and brown. The Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo! It is a veritable clusterfuck of a tux. Any takers? Five ninety-nine. It's 7.99 at Walmart. What about you fellas over here? No? No takers? You guys over here? Rainbow of colors. Rainbow. Oh. Jeez. - You can't sit here, man. - I can't and... And yet I am. I just wanna say thanks, man. For what, carrying your weak ass to the Infirmary? No, no, no. This morning at the site, you came to check on me. What? You were checking on my well-being after my night out. It was very Oprah. - Seven-thirty, just spew this shit out. - Oh, oh. I'm a vessel. This shit just comes to me from the universe. I put it back out there. I'm a channeler. I see things. - It's what I do. Hold on. - Believe this shit? I'm pretending I'm Christ trying to get the waiter back at my table... at the Last Supper. I just found a fly in my fish. - CVS. - CVS what? "CVS what?" "CVS wh..." CVS, man, the drugstore chain. You're a regional manager by 40. Yeah, you'll train somewhere in northern Virginia... but you end up back in Pennsylvania. Three perfect kids, a beautiful wife. You'll be living on Philly Main Line adjacent and driving a Jag. Doing your best not to bang it. Oh... You're just begging to get beat, you know that? That's bullshit, man. Uh-oh. Six Flags! Six Flags! We need not to be let alone. We need to be really bothered once in a while. How long is it since you were really bothered about something important? About something real. Ray, you are the shit. - Get up and get out of that. - Where am I going? - You got a visitor. - Forget it. I can't. You ought to see her, true piece. - I don't have all day, Wyatt. - Mm-hm. Mrs. Wyatt. Billy. Permission to return to population, sir? - Sit down, son. - Go to hell. Okay, I'm gonna sit. Will you get your hands off me? Okay, okay! There. Yeah, thank you! Billy, I just... I've... I've been thinking about you. I just wanted to know if you were okay, and I drove... Nobody asked you to. Is everything all right? I just wanted to see my son. Permission to return to population, sir. Jesus Christ, Billy, please stop staying that. I know, I know I've made mistakes, but... Permission to return to population! Okay, all right, Billy. Come with me. I'm sorry, Mrs. Wyatt. Just give me a minute. - Hey, hey, hey. - What? - So, what's the story? - There's no story. - Yeah, but she's your mother. - That's not my fault. So you won't talk to her? - No, I'm not gonna talk to her. - Here you go, ma'am. You can throw me back in there, but you cannot open my eyes. Maybe not this time. What do you want me to do, want me to handle it? Yeah. Please. - All right. All right, man. - Pl... Thank you. - Mrs. Wyatt. Uh... - Yes. I'm sorry, he just... - He just doesn't wanna talk to you. - No, no, I'm sorry. Sometimes these boys need extra time to adjust. - You can't blame yourself for it. - I know. Uh-huh. Okay, I should go. Sorry. I'll walk you to the car. - Here you go. - Thank you. Let's go, Mr. Wyatt. Hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey Whoa. Does Conrad know about this place? Yeah. And he's cool with it? Yeah. Conrad's an idiot, but he ain't stupid. He knows outside this place there's more of me than him. So Conrad makes allowances. Conrad, Carnalito, is a pussy. He's a pussy for you, El Gato. For Guillermo, he's a pussy with a whip. That douchebag's liable to bury me. Isn't that what you want, Guillermo? What are you, high? Yeah. But I'm right. Why you wanna die so bad? Huh? What did you do? Nothing. Man, you come in here taunting the bull, man... in the center of the ring. Calling Conrad out on his shit. Whoa. Going head to head with J.T. - Jesus, man. - Messing with De La Cruz. - What is this shit? - De La Cruz, man, heh, El Diablo. I don't know about Montgomery anymore. That's the devil's greatest trick. What you doing in here, Billy? You best let that shit out before it eats you alive. What did you do, Billy? I gotta know. My mother was here today. I can't even look at her. How do you ever go home? Fuck! Hey, hey. Don't. Oh, man. What the hell, Billy? Good evening, Sheriff Till. Get in the car, Billy. Yeah, see you around, officer. Sheriff Till? When you're done there, we need you back at the station. You know what I think, Billy? Any father who teaches his kid about Johnny Cash... - things ain't so bad. - You know what? You do not talk to me about my father, okay? And you don't talk about me. You don't know me. Well, you talk to me like a gentleman, Billy... or you shut the hell up. Come on, Billy. I don't belong in there, man. Things happened that shouldn't have happened. They just... - kept happening. - What things? Oh, come on. Why does everybody wanna know all of a sudden? Because they figure it's written all over your face. I can't say it. I don't... What do you want me to say? I don't know what to say. - Fair enough. - Yeah. Yeah, I'm messed up here, officer. Come on, Billy, stop. Billy. Shit! - No, no, no. Come on, just let me go. - Come on. Look, what are you doing? No. What...? Come on, Billy. Come on, calm down. Come on. Come on, man. No one's gonna care. Come on, Billy. Let me go! I still gotta take you back, Billy. You don't know what goes on in that place. Sure I do. No, you think you know the Bernville Camp for Boys, but you don't, man. Life is the Bernville Camp for Boys. Oh, Jesus Christ. If you're winding up for the heavy meaning-of-life pitch... - you'll have to do better than that. - Know what? Shut up and listen to me. Yes, sir. - All right? - Yes, sir. I'll shut up and listen to you. High school is the Bernville Camp for Boys. Afghanistan? The desert version. The police academy was the Bernville Camp for Boys. Hell, my marriage was a lot like that. The whole world is a Bernville Camp for Boys, Billy... and the only way out is through. That's bullshit. The only way out is to not get in. Well, you've managed to get yourself in, and I've gotta take you back. - I know. - Yeah. Can I ask you something? What? You gonna finish that? Stay down, Billy. Stay down. - This is it. - Mm-hm. Home sweet home. - Take care of yourself, kid. - Yeah. See you soon. I'm pretty sure you will. I feel like I'm shitting a river of fire. Nathan, man, why don't you let me take you to the infirmary? I got juice. I could hook you up with a bed with a view. Because the first time I complained, Conrad said that I was faking... and that if I bitched again, I wouldn't be faking anymore. Yeah, but I could talk to Nurse Simms. She'll listen to me. Nurse Simms? You mean Mother Teresa on animal tranqs? Oh, yeah, I know... I told you, Stein. You shit twice a day, morning and night. Sometimes these things are beyond our control, Conrad. Out! You pull up those pants and get out of here right now! I can't. It won't... It won't stop. You slam that sphincter shut and get on your feet... or I will kick you so hard, you'll shit from your eyes! - An image you could've kept to yourself. - Get that goddamn bucket! Give me that bucket, Wyatt! Damn it, Conrad! You shit off my schedule, you will shit in my bucket! - Conrad! - Please. Not to pull focus from Nathan here, but let me ask you something. In your trailer, how do you live with yourself? - You shut your mouth. - For example... at night, after you've tried to throw a jack, but you can't get it up... - and the loneliness settles in. - Shut up. You realize you're nothing but a Cro-Magnon fleck of worthlessness... who can only get his nut off by watching a sick kid shit in a bucket. How do you live with yourself, Connie? You shit in that bucket! This bucket is your friend, faggot! You will take this bucket with you wherever you go! Permission to use the laundry room, sir? Thank you. Stop! Stop! Get off of me. Stop! Stop. You and me, Jew lover. Kick off, man. Relax. Boys will be boys. Carlos, thanks for having my back last night. What are you gonna do when you get out of here? Get thrown back in. But not here though. In with the big boys. It's cool though. Top of the heap, you know? Okay. Um... Let's say fate was kind. Okay. Fate's a fucking magician. I'm gonna feel the wind in my face... and the silk of thighs wrapped around my neck... like the wings of angels. You... are no longer El Gato. You are now E! Poet-a- I see you, E! Poet-a... in San Francisco in a Kinko's. Yeah. That's your day job. But at night, en la noche... you're reading your poetry at Papalote's... while the chicks from Marin... mm-hm... they're swallowing your yarn. You're getting more kitty than a vet. Ooh-whee. Aw... Take me with you. We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed. As in filling a vessel drop by drop... there's at last a drop which makes it run over. So in a series of kindnesses... there is at last one, which makes the heart run over. Nathan, what are you doing? I'm having the perfect dream. I'm 7 in Michigan. Genesee County. And I'm with my parents at this place. I think it's called something like, um... the Miracle Twin Drive-In or something. And I'm in my pajamas in the backseat of the car. And I'm in that state where I'm not really asleep. I'm not fully awake. And... next thing I know, I wake up and it's morning, and I'm in my bed. I have no idea how I got there. And next door, I can hear our neighbor cutting the grass. Nathan... why'd you burn your parents' house down? There was some bad shit happening with my sister. My father would... He'd do stuff to her. And my mom wouldn't believe her. So I stole all my mom's jewelry... and sold it and gave the money to my sister. And she took off. And I couldn't go back. So I burned their house down. Figured it would be a nice goodbye present. I'm sorry. You got a sister, Billy? No. Hey, I didn't... I didn't burn it down all the way. I just kind of... This would be a weird place to die. Don't you think? Mags, what are your five favorite movies, right? And do not say Twilight in this car. Fine. Remember Me. The Runaways. Uh, Water for Elephants. Valentine's Day. And the fifth would have been Snow White and the Huntsman. - But we all know what happened... - Touch. Touch. If they ask me - Ask me my five favorite films. - Where's this coming from? It's what I was thinking about in Trig. Number one, Scarface. Two, Godfather! and II, which I count as one. Three, Bronx Tale. Four, 8 Mile. Five, Boyz n the Hood. Heh. You know you're white, right? Ha-ha-ha. Oh, don't, no. Oh, I love, yes. Oh, come on. Or hang around for you' Well, I make it pretty good Until that moon comes shinin' through And then I get So doggone lonesome I'm sure you know what you're talking about. You know, Nathan, you really look like shit. Gentlemen, please. Gentlemen. It has come to my attention that this year's community construction project... has, shall we say, stagnated. What the hell was it supposed to be anyway? I have no idea. This was supposed to be something created by you as a group. Something of lasting value. - He'll say "future generations." - Something for posterity. I'm slipping. Groups of the past have chosen to construct... a large double-truck recycling bin for the St. Thomas Fundamentalist Church. We've had a backstop for the Will Stevens Memorial softball field... over at Redding. And my favorite, from the fall of '09 population... a pair of oak picnic tables with matching benches... for the Pennsylvania Lenape. Now, I don't know. Maybe this year's project of the outdoor chapel... "Outdoor chapel"? Has just not been as inspiring as I'd hoped it'd be. But never in the history of the Bernville Camp for Boys... have we not completed a project. Now, I am more than open to hearing suggestions... as to how we might gain some inspiration in moving this forward. And you may discuss this amongst yourselves. But make no mistake... this project will be completed by you one way or another. So get on it, gentlemen. You have two weeks. - Sir. Sir. Sir. - Oh... We know right now. We know exactly what we wanna build. - We do? - We do. Sir, in the spirit of the Bernville Camp for Boys' outdoor chapel... I'm picking up a transcendental vibe from the entire group. And I feel more than confident in saying we'd like to jump the tracks, if you will... and build right here on the premises, for posterity and future generations... our very own drive-in movie theater. Yes, but... That's very interesting. But we don't have cars here, so what would be the point? Okay, no cars, right. Literal crowd. But, come on, I mean... Well, can we give it up and let go for the Bernville Camp for Boys movie theater? - Come on now! - Yeah! Come on, who's got the spirit today, boys? I got the spirit today! - Can I get an "amen"? - Amen. - Can I get a "hallelujah"? - Hallelujah. That's right, boys! Give it up! I'm talking about our very own... nostalgia-laden, kickass... blast from the past, customized... glamorized, actual-sized! Give it up, hermanos, and brothers and Fourth Reichians! Give it up! Give it up! - Amen! - Amen! - Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! - Amen! - Amen! - Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! That was a terrific speech, Billy. Terrific. Tell you what I'm gonna do. You boys build it, and I'm gonna find us a projection system. How about that? - Yeah. - Yeah! That was... That was really wonderful, Billy. It was really, really inspiring. Can I get an "amen" one more time, brothers? Hallelujah! - So now what, valiente? - What? What you mean, "what?" This is your damn idea, fool. Yeah, exactly. I brought the idea. I'm the genesis. I'm... I'm the well from which the idea for the theater sprung. Beyond that, I have nothing. I have no actual skills. Wait, we know how. Earl knows. Go ahead, man. Tell him. - Don't be putting your hands on me. - Yeah, well, then come on, bitch! - Whoa, whoa! Jesus Christ. - What's up? It's for the movie theater, damn it. J.T., chill. Just bend over. Or tilt. At least tilt. Can I just-J'? Just a tilt. Thank you. Holy shit. It's a pretty simple design. My grandfather designed a bunch of drive-ins before they shot his ass. The Circle Drive-In in Scranton? That's his. - I got blown there once. Or twice. - Yeah, right. That's a lovely visual. Earl, just continue. Need about 12 sheets of one-inch thick marine-grade plywood. We have that already. About four times as many truss clamps. About 242-by-6s. That'd give us our base. And about nine 2-by-4s to shore it up. Oh, we're gonna need some laminated acetate for the screen. Where are we gonna get that? Sheets. We could use sheets? Yup. Sheets will work. Let's go, huh? Sheets will work. Sheets will work. Yo, hold the board straight, bro. Pass me that hammer. Docent, Museum of Tolerance. Let me help you with that. Dentist. - You're not holding it right. - Head of advertising, foreign air. That's looking good, Holmes. - The top. - There we go. America's Next Top Model winner. Yeah, man. Those 2-by-4s are right there to the left. Librarian. - Duluth. - Bring that over here. Prison guard. Let's get it up, guys. Come on. Lift it up. Lift it up. Nice and easy. Come on, give it a little... A little push. - Come on. You got this. - There you go. Go ahead. Lift. Get it up. Get it up. - You got this. You got this. Yeah. - Easy, easy. A little more. - Almost. - Yeah. We got it. - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah, man. - Good job, guys. You got it up. - That looks sexy, baby. - What do you think, man? - It's beautiful. - Told you. Told you. - I know. I didn't doubt you. Look at this. Look at this. - Look at this. Ha-ha-ha. - Good job, guys. Guy's been ducking me for two weeks. When I see him, I'm gonna break his face. - Do you like him? - He's a fucking jerk. Ten dollars. You got off cheap. He's out of your life. Eh... I'm still gonna fucking break his face. It ain't Michigan and you're not 7... but it is pretty cool, ain't it, Nate? Yeah. You knocked it out of the park, Billy. I only have eyes For you, dear My love must be a kind of blind love I can't see anyone but you This movie thing was your idea? Would that I could take sole credit. I'm simply the humble vessel... - Shut up. - From which the idea sprung. Shut up. Genesis of the idea. It's Tina. My name. It's very nice to meet you, Tina. This is amazing. Mr. Miracle Boy. I don't know if it's cloudy or bright I only have eyes For you I work here, Billy. But I bet neither of us are gonna be here forever... odds are. - You go to this school? - I'm Jane. Permission to rejoin the population. Granted. I just moved here. Yeah, because I seen you on the bus the other day. And you're...? Me, I'm Calogero. Ca-who? Calogero. What kind of name is that? It's Italian. But actually, it's Sicilian. My family's from Sicily. Sicily? You know where Italy is? - I've gotta see her. - Who? Tina. - Who the hell's Tina? - Nurse Simms is Tina. - Her name is Tina? - Yeah. Her name... - That's kind of dirty and awesome. - Oh, stop. I gotta see her, man. - Dude, you're dreaming. - Yeah. I know. You okay? No. No. - Should I get the bucket? - No. Screw the bucket. Oh, it's time for Screw the Bucket. I'm your host RuPaul on this week's edition. Shut up, Billy. Not now, man. Guard. Guard! You know, actually, I think I'm feeling a little better. Well, I think you look a little better. And that is my informed medical opinion. I'm just a little tired though. Then I prescribe... sleep. He came in with bronchitis and an intestinal infection. It's just getting worse. He's a pretty sick kid, Billy. Then why isn't he in a hospital? Um, I've got orders. You're a nurse. And I'm just learning to live by the rules. Until my shit is straight, I've gotta do what I'm told. Gotcha. How long have you been clean or straight or you know? Seven months and 18 days. I keep waiting... for the hunger to stop. I keep waiting... to be still. I keep waiting like a good girl. I keep waiting... for you to say something. Maybe you can't get really found... until you get really lost. No. Please. Sorry. That's just too weird. I mean, I'm supposed to be a nurse. You're supposed to be a kid. And that's just... That's too weird, even for me. Weird isn't wrong. I know. I know. Sometimes it's amazing. And sometimes it is wrong. And sometimes it's both. Like now? Yes. Neither of us needs any more weirdness, Billy. I'm sorry. It's not like I've never heard "no" before. It's not "no." It's... It's "wait." Good night, Billy. Go to bed. Running them city lights Running to get there on time But I'm just too late God bless you for letting me say "no." Trying to make a mental note Trying to think about what I used to hear That's a first for me. Ride away tonight Wanna press rewind' Try to make sense The sound of your voice on the call It's always been there But this time it's me left alone Guess it can hit this close to home I got you, I got you. What would that mean? Billy. - A word, please. - Clandestine. - That's very funny, Mr. Wyatt. - Ancillary? I'd like to talk to you, please. What's up, Montay? Montiago. Montel Williams. The Full Monty. You know, your work with the outdoor theater was really, really impressive. I really, really didn't do that much. I think you've done a lot more than you realize. Oh. Okay. - Is there a tux on my golden horizon? - No. No. But I'm impressed. I'm so impressed that I'm gonna assign you trustee status. Does that mean that I get to get out of this hellhole early? No offense. None taken. And not exactly. Come here. I wanna show you something. I want you to meet... The White Goddess. Monty? We have to get you a woman. I want you to care for her like she's truth and beauty on wheels. I can do that. You know, I employ three different types of polishes on her... throughout the year. In the fall, a medium carnauba, and it's always... You always polish in straight lines, never in circles. Straight lines. - Well, ain't this some shit? - Goddamn movie theater. - I was the brains. - We did all the work. And he takes all the glory. What a setup. Come on, man. We're back in the cotton field. Oh, Nathan, you see your boy? Who gonna help you now? You seem to be a bit all over the place here... aesthetically speaking. What do you really think of me? Oh. That's like a wife asking her husband if she looks fat. - I'm not going there. - Come on, please tell me. Okay, you look fat. You seem to be on some kind of mission, huh? Boy, I'd love to know what that is. Hell-bent on saving every boy here at the camp. What with all your speeches and your prognostications. Is that a word? I don't think that's a word. But, you know, you're on a roll. So carry on, please. Open it. Why open it? I lived it. All right, then. Shouldn't be that difficult refreshing your memory, huh? Grand theft auto. Vandalism. Dealing mushrooms and sampling your own wares. And you got busted by the police... at 4 a.m., naked on a corner in Riverdale, wow. I don't mean to get technical, sir, but I was wearing socks. You think I don't know anything, do you? Just like anybody who's ever tried to tell you anything. But I'll tell you, I do know one thing. I know what it's like to lose a father. When I was 13 years old, I found out my father had cancer. And the next two years, I just watched him wither away. Brought him home from the hospital so he could spend the last few days with us. I remember one morning I was going to school... and I heard the TV on in the living room. And I thought my father was just watching The Today Show. But he wasn't. He wasn't watching anything. He was... He had a plastic bag around his head. He decided to beat God to the punch. So, you see, I do know what it's like to lose a father. And everything around you just becomes so stupid. Your friends, your teachers. And you know what really pisses you off? Is everybody's cockiness. Thinking that everything is so important, so dramatic. Like everything's gonna last forever. The day we buried them... I looked across the street from the cemetery... and there was this guy mowing his lawn... like nothing had happened. And it made me insane. Billy, do you know why you're here? Not because you dealt drugs or you... Or you stole a car. Please don't. Because you need to learn a lesson, Billy. You need to learn that no one gets away with anything. Not with all your jokes, and all your charm and all your talk. You know, that's just bullshit. Whoo! - Hey. - Hi. - You're Billy's sister, yeah? - Yeah. - Have you seen him around? - Mm-hm. - Speak of the devil. - Ollie. Come on, man. I told you, not here. - I'm sorry, man, I forgot what you said. - That's cool, man. Why don't you go see Dad? You've been begging us to beat you for it. But I'm not gonna do that, Billy. I'm not. I'm gonna teach you how to live with it. By admitting it. You were at the wheel. And if you hadn't been wasting time with your dealer... y'all would've made it. Oh, don't, no. Oh, I love, yes. Oh, come on. Or hang around for you' Let me give you a little father-son, Billy. You're driving in your car... you turn on the radio. Your girl's riding shotgun. She's got her hand on your knee. Dad, we got a little girl in the backseat here. A song comes on the radio... the kind of song makes you drive until it's over... so you crank it up. If she says "turn it down"... dump her at the next corner. Does Mom ever turn it down? Not once. What was that thing with the kid there? Dad, it was nothing. Sometimes I think Doing the right thing is never nothing, Billy. One lonely hour seems forever You can't go back there. You know what they'll do to you? AH that's over. From now on, you just stay at the trustee dorm. And the rest of your time here will be just penance. Not punishment. You're too smart for punishment. But just ripe enough for penance. That's why I like you. That's why I think you're special. Hey, Nathan. You know what I think? I think your boy Billy is cruising the Cruz. Always thought he was a slammer. Him with all his flowery talk and his reading and shit. Blow me, Earl. You didn't just say that, Med Baby. - What did he say? - Maybe you didn't hear me. Blow me. Nathan, my man. That was a mistake. - Earl, leave him alone. - Yo, chill. - Yo, Nathan. - Nathan. - He's gonna kill him, yo. - Yeah. - All right, ease up. - All right, that's enough. Get him up. Things don't work out so good when there's no Billy around. I do believe it's time for your fitting. Get your bucket. Pick it up. Don't you spill that shit on me. Let's go. Hey, Billy. Some lemonade would be nice, huh? Okay, there's nothing you can do for him. And don't waste your time with some heroic fantasies either, all right? Focus on your own salvation. Hey, Billy, can you get that? Hello. Yes. Who's calling, please? Who? These plugs are in incredible mint condition. - Who... Who was that? - Your father. He wanted to know if you were still playing golf Sunday. I was doing this to help you out. I made a little mistake, but... I know these kinds of things? My prognostications! - Yo, Billy! - Yo, son! Yo, Billy! Yeah! - Are you kidding me? - You back? You know, this... This dying thing kind of sucks. I don't wanna hear that shit. You are not dying, okay? Nobody is dying. - Stay up. Stay up, B. - Yeah. - What the hell is going on? - Tina. Help me. Get his head. You got him? Hey, we have an emergency. Please hurry. Mr. Wyatt. Come out of the car immediately. Shit! Mr. Wyatt. Mr. Wyatt, get out of the car. Now, if you come out right now, no one's gonna get hurt. Mr. Stein's gonna be taken care of. You understand? Ain't that some shit? Come on, Mr. Fuentes. I want you to back up right now. I see you, Guillermo. Take everybody with you. You got this place high up in the Sangre de Cristo mountains. You can't think of the last line of your fifth novel. You got one baby bouncing on your knee and another on the way. Your neighbor's playing his horn. And it's sunset. All around you, your world is painted red and gold. Then it comes to you, the last line of your novel. Tomorrow doesn't have to be yesterday. What the hell's going on? Go ahead, handle it. Just do whatever you have to do, I don't care. Just handle it. Do it. Go ahead, do it. Come on, Conrad. What the hell you doing? - I'm not shooting a kid. - Where you going? Come back here, you coward! Time to go home, Billy. If you go back to your dorms right now, nothing will happen to you, understand? Go, go, go for it. Go. - Come on, come on. - The only way out is through. Do it, you crazy motherfucker! Wyatt, it's your last chance. - Go, Billy! - Come on. You guys have to get going now. Come on, get to it. Get them! What are you doing? Go get him! The kid just stole my car! Don't ask for guarantees. And don't look to be saved... in any one thing, person, machine or library. Do your own bit of saving. And if you drown, at least die knowing you were heading for shore. - I got him. I got it, I got it. - You got it? Hey. Hey. Nathan. Hey. Don't you die, man, okay? You're the first dude who could stand me in a long time. You too, Billy. Thank you. Billy! - Billy! - Sir, can you step out, please? Thank you. - Can you hear me? Okay. - No, he's unconscious. He's breathing. Can you pull him out? Look out for his head. Grab his legs. His sister. Just please try to find his sister. Yeah, okay. I'll try. People like us... we find each other all the time. But that's the wonderful thing about man. He never gets so discouraged or disgusted... that he gives up doing it all over again... that he gives up doing it all over again... because he knows very we" it is important and worth the doing. Billy? What are you doing? - It's okay, Mom. - Why are you here? - Why are you here? - Billy Wyatt? Turn around slowly and put your hands behind your head. It's okay, Mom. I just came home to say I'm sorry. It's gonna be okay. I am sorry too. I love you. I love you too. I've waited so long to hear you say that. - You love me? - Yeah, I love you. You love me. High up above those days of glory But that's just living in a memory' I'm so far down There's nowhere left to fall' We've all been winners We've all been losers The world was watching When I struck out It hits you hardest When you let your guard down They say losing makes you strong But it hurts But it's all right 'cause I know I tried We've all been winners We've all been losers Don't need a prize To hold my head up high No matter winner or loser Winner or loser' Life's just a balance Of the rise and fall If we always won It would mean nothing at all You showed me beauty In the simple things Yet where'd it go? Welcome the spring But it's all right 'Cause I know I tried We've all been winners We've all been losers Don't need a prize To hold my head up high No matter winner or loser Winner or loser' We're better than we were before It makes for humble hearts Mine and yours But it's all right 'cause I know I tried We've all been winners We've all been losers Don't need a prize To hold my head up high No matter winner or loser Winner or loser
