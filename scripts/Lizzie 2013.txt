It was the fourth day of August in 1892. The quaint town of Fall River was of the usual view. 15 new companies... 22 mills in full operation. The resulting wealth of Andrew Borden was the town's admiration. But Abby, Emma, and Lizzie were not able to live proper, for Andrew was dreadfully frugal, making his family live like paupers. Lizzie was most affected by Andrew's money tight constraint, for the banishment from the upper class was her only complaint. So ten after 11:00 on that dreadful day, Lizzie called out for help with such disarray. "Someone's killed father," she despondently claimed. But the town, in an uproar, professed that she was to blame. So Lizzie was arrested and rushed off to jail, and they caged her ten months, for they refused her bail. And when the trial finally came about, they assumed a conviction would come without doubt. A picture of Andrew shown to the jury, causing the entire town even more fury, And the haunting photo of who once was Abby gave the crime scene even more gravity. All the evidence was not in Lizzie's defense, and the trial came to an end with a weighted suspense, The jury stood to give their verdict aloud. "Not guilty" was declared and shocked the crowd. Innocence proven, she expects sympathy and esteem, but instead she was banished as a murderer they would deem, So Lizzie Borden fled from that zealous town, never again to be acquitted seen around. Lizzie's eventual death from misery's solution, where she still roams, out for retribution. Lizzie Borden took an ax and gave her mother 40 whacks And when she saw what she had done she gave her father 41 Lizzy, you're not in any danger. Pay attention to my voice. You are calm and relaxed. Lizzy. Lizzy, describe to me. Stay calm and relaxed. Lizzy, it is essential that I know what you're seeing. We've come this far. We can do this. Lizzy. Lizzy. I'm here. Breathe. Daddy! Lizzy, Lizzy. Lizzy. Lizzy? Okay, then. Come on, breathe. Breathe. Lizzy, Lizzy. I'm here. Breathe. Lizzy! Come on, Lizzy. Stay here with me. Lizzy. Lizzy. Lizzy. Stay with me. Lizzy, wake up! Wake up. Stop! Baby, baby. What? Are you okay? Yes! Damn it! I'm fine. No. I'm not okay. I'm not okay. Just give me a minute, okay? I think I should start taking those pills again that Dr. Fredricks suggested. What? I know, I know, but I'm just really going out of my mind lately And I'm seeing things, uncomfortable things, and they're in my dreams. They're fast and furious. And I'm just... I'm feeling really really weird here. What? You don't think I should take them? No, it's not that, but do you remember the side effects? You never wanted to take them. I mean, your nightmares got so bad. I don't think you even remember, but one time, you were choking. I know, I know, okay. You don't have to remind me, okay? You don't have to keep bringing it up. It's just one small piece of the past. It's just, I never should have... Gotten together? Moved in together? No. Not at all. You're the best. You're the one thing that's keeping me from going completely insane. Lizzy, it's just a house and it's yours. I am so confused. When Dr. Fredricks recommended this... they took care of everything. They, who is they? The lawyers? The lawyers took care of everything? Honey, you don't even remember living here. No, I know, but I should. From what they told me, I was living here when I was just a child. Just let it go. Like you said, it's part of the past. It's just you and me now. Dr, Fredricks said something happened to me in this house. And now I'm back. I just... I want out of that house! Hmm, well, Lizzy, it sounds like your childhood environment is triggering some memories, as unpleasant as they may be. No! There's something going on in the house. I know it! Well, okay, that's something. I know what you're going to say. I don't want to sound like a broken record, but we've been down this road. It wasn't a daydream. Okay? I mean, it was, but it wasn't. What do you mean It wasn't? It just... it seemed so real. You know, it's very hard to explain, but it wasn't... it wasn't fuzzy or dreamlike, It's like I was really there, and... I don't know. I was really surprised when I woke up in the morning. I didn't even have that much to drink. Have you... have you been taking your pills? Yes. Well, I stopped taking them for a while because of Jason, but I just started taking them again And I thought that the daydreams would stop when I started taking them again, but I guess I'm still having them? I don't know. How does Jason feel about all of this? Jason thinks I'm crazy. No, he's been very, very supportive, and I can tell that he is very worried about me. Lizzy, what would you say if you were in my shoes? "This visit's on me"? No, I'm serious. Seriously. I would probably say that you're just stressed out and tired and having really bad nightmares or daydreams. How about you just lost your job, you've got a new boyfriend, you just moved back into your old house, all, what, in the course of a year. Those are some serious life changes in a very, very short amount of time. And the stress that has followed brings up all these childhood memories which weren't perfect to begin with. Huh? Yeah. Why do you think that you can't remember? Where are those memories? I am going to dip my wick in your candy pool? What an ugly doll. I might say, your dress is quite lovely. Where on earth did you find it? Really, I do! They are so marvelous. My mother shopped there for years. He what? I don't know if Thomas likes me, or not. Did he ask you about me or something? He said what? He did? I'm so happy! How is your tea, Suzy? Do you want some more? Great! Lizzy! Warning! Sedation, lethargy, difficulty thinking, memory loss, nightmares, Manic feelings, delusions, seizures, and death. Well, it's prescribed. Oh, God. Damn it! I always do that. Ow! No! Daddy! - Hello? - Lizzy? Is everything okay? I've been trying to call you for half an hour. A half an hour? What are you talking about? I've been calling your cell phone and the house phone. What, you can't hear it? No, I was in the bathroom and I shattered my glass everywhere. You sound funny. Are you okay? No. No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Just I'm feeling a little out of it is all. Look, just run a bath and I'll be... Hello? Jason. Jas... "We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed. " "Please check the number and dial again. " "We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed... " Honey, I'm home! Baby, you're home! Lizzy, I'm losing the groceries. Looks like you're feeling better. I am feeling better. I took a really long nap, and I just relaxed. That's great. So tell me you got the wine. What are you talking about? Baby, please tell me you got wine. Yes, of course I got the wine. Yes! Thank you. So I made a couple phone calls today, and it looks like I'm going to be tutoring next week. That's great. How do you open this fucking thing? You know, for all the wine you drink, you should really learn how to use a corkscrew. Just be patient. It will... Baby. Baby, can you please open it for me? Let me get this straight. I'm an overworked man out in the sun all day pouring concrete and cutting 2X4s. And I'm making you dinner and you want me to open this fucking thing? Yes, I do. Thank you. So it looks like it's not going to be a lot of money, but... I think it's going to get me out of the house for awhile. Well, if you're happy, I'm happy. That's really good. Oh, and I got a movie. Really? What did you get? It's one of my favorites. Until we get the cable, you're just going to have to trust me. Okay, I trust you. Baby, hurry! I don't want to watch this by myself. Okay, okay, I'm coming. Come on. Come on, we have to go. Thank you. I'm going to go get help. Did it get to the good part yet? Which part is the good part? Well, all of it is the good part. I've seen this, like, a hundred times. I used to watch this as a kid. I bet you didn't get much sleep. Well, it didn't really bother me. It freaked out Ryan. Your little brother? It scares the hell out of me and I'm an adult. I used to sneak outside and bang on his bedroom window. And one time, I wrote his name in fake blood on the bathroom mirror. Are you serious! You're such an asshole. I am not. I provide a... You provide a lot of shit. I mean, poor Ryan. With a brother like you, who needs enemies? I'm not anyone's enemy. Who gets cheap thrills scaring the hell out of somebody? I mean, no wonder Ryan doesn't talk to you. Lizzy, watch the movie. Never mind. The forecast, cloudy skies with flurries today. We can expect up to an inch of snow... Somebody there? Jason, Jason, are you awake? Jason, Jason, wake up. I heard something. It's coming from the kitchen. Lizzy, it's probably nothing. Jason! Jason, wake up! There's somebody trying to get in! Okay, I'm up. I'm up. Jason, there's somebody banging on the kitchen window. Are you sure? Yes, damn it! I'm telling you. You know what? Forget it. I'm calling the cops. No, don't. I'll go check it out. It's probably just the neighborhood kids doing something. It's fine, just... Whatever. I'll handle it myself. Fucking scary movies. Are you all right? Stop! Jason? Jason? Is that you? Who's there? Stop! What are you trying to say to me? Suzy, meet the nice lady. Who are you? What do you want? What is it? She's here! She? Who's she? She's here... Who? Who is she? She wants... Wants what? What does she want? She wants to kill me. Have you... Have you been taking your pills? Lizzy, it sounds like your childhood environment is triggering some memories, as unpleasant as they may be. Who is it? Yes? Who is it? Who is it? Jason? Jason, answer me! - I'm the cable guy. - Who are you? I'm the cable... Don't have a cow, bitch. I'm the cable guy. Come in. Didn't you hear me yelling at you? I tried the front door. No, I was asking you... like three or four times I asked who it was. I was jamming. I was jamming. What? What? You scared the shit out of me. You know what? I'm going to call your boss. I'm sorry, Mrs... Allen. Miss Allen. You know what? Just call me... just call me Lizzy, okay? I like that, Lizzy. My name is Jared. Pleased to meet you, Lizzy. Come in. It's right over here. Oh, Jesus Christ. This is fucking shit, fucking shit. I think I know what... Look at... Look at it. Look at the fucking screen. This is... Oh, Jesus Christ. I chose the wrong fucking profession. Just fuck my mother as well, you Jesus Christ, man. Major job. Major problem. But don't worry about that. I can take care of that. That's my job. So you enjoy installing cable? Fills the fridge. I have 16 kids. 16? 17. One is retarded. But you know, it's just a temporary job until I find out exactly what I want. I understand that. How long you been doing this? 16 months? Yes. Oh. Hey, baby. Hey, crazy. Look, I forgot to tell you the cable guy's going to show up later today, so when he does, let me know. I have some questions... He's here right now. And don't call me crazy, crazy. Hey, ask him about hooking up the internet. Ah, it's working now, Lizzy. Oh, no. He can't do anything about the internet. Baby, listen to me. Baby, he can. Just ask him. Cable companies do internet, too. Okay, I'll ask him but just stop yelling at me. Ah, I know. Don't tell me. Your old man wants internet, too, right? Yeah. Don't do it. You know why? Why? Between me and you. Right. He wants to check out hot chicks. Why? To get fresh pussy. That's what he wants. Because yeah, yeah, he wants fresh pussy. Oh, really? You can cool down now. You know, you're... Nobody wants... Yeah, yeah, but cool chicks. Cold meat? That's what you are in his eyes. Cold meat. You're not hot chicks anymore, okay? Okay. Yeah, but don't get too discouraged. You know, in my eyes, you're hot. Oh, thank you. You know why you're hot? Why? Because you're sexy. You know why you're sexy? Why? Because you're very stupid. Oh, I'm stupid. Yeah, you are. Stupid and sex... Stupidity is sexiness. Oh, I'm stupid. Okay. Very stupid. Right. And you're sexy. Oh, great. Thank you. What do we need to do about this connection here? Let's see. I need for you to show me where the connection is. I... let's go. This way. Let's go. I love that. Anyway... Call me. This is my business card. If a woman answers, hang up. Just right this way. All right. You know, Lizzy. There must be a cut cable somewhere around here. There we go. Oh, I guess... No, I'm sorry. Oh, you know what? Must be here. It must be in here. Just got to get it open. Okay. I don't know. It's nailed shut or something. I can't get it open. Yeah. It's a man's job, Lizzy. It's a man's job. You'll learn that sooner or later. Give Mr. Macho a break here. No. We've got to get some guys to move that board away later. I don't know. What's... what's in there anyway? I mean, like Jimmy Hoffa? I don't know. I'm not going down there. I mean, can't you just hook it up, or... No. No, Lizzy. It's a no-no. No. We have to get this cable here. First we want to unhook it, and then we move on from there. We wouldn't want to get into any more violations. Code violations here, okay? So you don't want that. Trust me. Damn it! Oh, yeah. Ow, ow, ow. Jason? Is that you? Okay, just... Not again. Just focus. Stay calm. Just focus. Jason? Jason? Jason. Jason, is that you? Hey. Stay away from me. Get away from me. No. No, no, no. Don't come near me. No! Lizzy. Lizzy, my nana gave me that vase. Jason? Nana gave me this vase. What... are you shitting me right now? My God, you're such an asshole! I'm not your friggin' little brother. Lizzy, it was just a joke. Lizzy. I was just joking around. Look, it's just a joke. Lizzy. Great. Jason. Baby? Come in. Forgive me? No. Why did you do that? You know that I hate scary movies. You scared the crap out of me. It was almost like you thought it was funny. Not cool. I know, I'm... I'm sorry. It was really stupid, really immature, and... I'm really sorry, baby. I won't do it again. Sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. I don't know. I'm-I'm worried that they're coming back. Listen, Lizzy. Now that you've moved back into that environment, I'd like to give it another shot. Give what another shot? Hypnotherapy. No, no! Absolutely not! Lizzy, there's no way you can move forward with your life unless you understand and know your past. Yes, I can. People move forward with their lives without knowing about their pasts. People with amnesia or whatever. You know, I don't want to care about the past. I finally have a life with Jason. The past is over and done with. Who cares? Can't you just give me some stronger pills or something and then we can both move forward with our lives. All right, listen. These pills are quite a bit different than the ones I've been giving you. They're... they're stronger and they have more of a calming effect than a feel good effect. And you're not meant to drink alcohol with them. Is that understood? Yes. No, no, thank you, Doctor. No alcohol. Yes. It makes their effect stronger. There you go. No alcohol. Yes. Thank you. Whoa, Jay. Jay. Sorry. You just scared the shit out of me. I'm sorry. No, that's all right. You feeling all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I just feel a little, you know, out of it. Oh, you been drinking with Lizzy all night. No, we got into a fight and I didn't get much sleep anyways, but I just feel kind of beat up. Oh, you want the day off? Oh, fuck no, man. I need the money. Good, well, get your ass in the goddamn truck. We have work to do. Hey, babe. Um... hi. What's wrong? Are you drunk? No. I had a few beers, but I'm not drunk. Why? Because it's nine o'clock, and you're just now getting home, and you're slurring your words a little bit. Well, I got off late and the new foreman wanted to grab a beer and talk about a job next week. Really? So why didn't you call me and tell me that? Because I left my phone at the shop. We went from the site to the bar. I don't believe you. What? Your coming home drunk this late? It's pretty convenient that you didn't have your phone on you. Why am I getting the third degree? I don't get to mind myself. Why are you so angry? I'm not angry, all right? It's just that I work hard all day and come home to you flipping out on me? Crazy, I should be getting a blow job or... Stop fucking calling me that, okay? Blow job, seriously? I've been home all day expecting you at five o'clock. Here it is nine o'clock and I haven't heard a fucking word until now? Did you hear what I said? I don't have my phone. Why didn't you use a pay phone, or your boss's cell phone or something? You want me to use my boss's cell phone to call you just because you're insecure? Oh, so now I'm insecure... and a crazy person? What do you think I was doing? You think I was fucking some chick? Well, you've done it before. Are you okay? Yeah, I think so. It looked like you hit your head pretty hard. Who are you? I'm so sorry. I'm your new neighbor. I'm Maggie. I saw that you guys moved in last week and I've been meaning to come over and say hello but I just haven't had a chance. And I heard your husband... Oh, he's not my husband. Well, I heard your boyfriend get in his truck and drive away real fast. He did? Yeah, we got into a fight and I said some things to really piss him off, so he does that. I completely understand. My boyfriend and I just broke-up, so... So, why were you... Well, I heard your... I heard your boyfriend... Jason. Jason leave, and then I heard screams coming from in here. You heard screams from in here? Yeah. Oh, that's strange. I, um... I think I took a nap after Jason left. Well, I know what I heard. And I... I think it was you. Another nightmare. A nightmare. Um... I got up really quickly and I got dizzy, and then I saw you out here. And at the time, I couldn't really see you, and... I thought you were here to hurt me. Oh my God. Not at all. The door was unlocked, and I saw you there in the hallway, and I asked if you were okay. Well, I thought I heard a voice, but it didn't make any sense. Well, I was really loud. I mean, I feel really bad. No, no, don't feel bad. I-I've been feeling really strange lately. Ever since I moved back into this house, all sorts of weird things have been happening to me. It doesn't make any sense at all. Oh, hey. What? I'm Maggie. I'm your neighbor. Jason. I'm Lizzy. Nice to meet you. Both of you. I have to get up early so I should probably hit the sack. Nice to meet you... Maggie. Jackass. How about a drink? Would you like a drink? Yeah. I have this friend who has this really great winery. He makes delicious wine. I think this will definitely do the trick. Fucking weird ass doll. Lizzy? Lizzy? She says its not her fault, but nobody believes her. What's not her fault? You don't know? It's not my fault. Maggie? Let's bust open that basement door you were telling me about last night. Yeah, just give me a second to wake up. You got five minutes. You're not much for knocking are you? Wait. What? I don't know. Shouldn't we let Jason do this? Why? Because. What if we fuck something up and we can't get inside. Don't worry about it. It will be easy. You just drink your coffee and let me do all the work, okay? Okay. God. Oh, God. All right. One more time. Okay, let's try. Okay. All right, should we... You want to... No, you. You swing. You're good. You know what? Take and edge and try to pry it. Yeah, exactly. It's impossible. All right. Ready? Oh, God. We're getting it a little. Here. No, I want to do it. I want to do it. Oops. Come on. Come on. Come on, Jason. Hello? Who's in there? Hey! I'm giving you five seconds to get the fuck out of here. That's it. I'm calling the cops. I'm not playing around, man. You'll pay. Stop! Shit. I'm telling you, they're not working! The pills aren't working? No! They're not working, okay? I'm nervous and I'm anxious and I'm... I'm having nightmares. And I'm ruining my relationship with Jason. Lizzy, I understand. Breathe. Everything is going to be okay. No, it's not! Okay, I'm losing my fucking mind. What? Why are you looking at me like that? So what do you think we should do? I don't know what to do. That's why I'm paying you. You want me to tell you what to do? Yes, I want you to tell me what to do. I'm not your parent, Lizzy, and you're no longer a little girl. And I'm not here to tell you what to do. As a matter of fact, you know exactly what you have to do. No, I really don't. The answer to every one of your problems is right in front of your face, Lizzy. But you've been rejecting it this entire time. I don't know what you're talking about, okay? Can't you just give me some stronger pills or something? I'm not going to do that anymore. What? Why not? Because pills are not helping you solve your problem. Oh, God. Do we have to do this right now? I need relief from this shit, whatever it is. I can't continue with these sessions. What are you talking about? Sorry, Lizzy. This is going to be our last session. I don't... I don't understand. Why? I can't help you fix the present, if you're not willing to face the past. Come on. Are you kidding me? I can't help you anymore. So let me get this straight. You're not going to help me anymore because I can't face my childhood? Oh, my God. You know, you don't know everything. You don't know what it's like to be in my shoes, to lay awake every night, frozen in fear, until 4:00 A.M. All you have are your Ivy League theories and complexes. You know, I despise people like that. Thanks for nothing. I'm sorry. For what? For the fight. We haven't talked for, like, two days. Yeah. I'm sorry, too. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Why? I don't know. You just seem really out of it. Must be tired or something. Okay, why don't you go lay down. You look really exhausted. All right. Okay. Hey, I miss you. I miss you, too. Hey, Maggie. What are you wearing? Oh sweetie, sweetie, come in. what's wrong? It's Andrew! Who's Andrew? Here, sweetie. All right. Now tell me what's wrong. I have to come clean to you about a couple of things, okay? Okay. I know I told you that I lived with my boyfriend and he just moved out, right? Yeah. Well, my real name is Bridget and I'm actually a live-in maid for a family. Andrew is the father, Abby is the mother, and Lizzy is the daughter. Okay, that's fine. What's got you so upset, Maggie? Bridget. It's Andrew. He... He what? He, you know... violated me. Oh, my God. I'm calling the cops. No, no, don't. You don't understand. You don't understand. Andrew has a lot of money... and he... he's protected. That's a bunch of bull. I'm calling the cops. Yes, yes, hello. My name is Lizzy Allen and my friend just told me that she was... Raped! That she was raped. The address? What's the address? 92 Second Street, Fall River. It's 92 Second Street in Fall River. Please hurry. What? No, there must be some mistake. No, 92 Second Street in Fall River. Please check again. I don't understand. They're saying there's no such... Address. Hello? Hello. Maggie? Bridget? Maggie? Is somebody there? Maggie, who are you talking to? No, Mr. Borden, please. Maggie, who are you talking to? Abby cannot bear me a son to take my name and my fortune. She is barren. She's childless. That's not true, Mr. Borden. Borden? What? What is true is Lizzie and her funny ways. Messing around with other girls. And that brings an embarrassment to the love in my heart. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, the damnation of hell will be upon ye. " Yes, that's where you belong! They're gonna get what's coming to them... and you're going to give me my son. No, don't you hear me? You will give me a son. Stop it! I squirted you, and you're carrying my baby right now. Hear me? You hear me? You bastard. Run, Bridget! Find Lizzie and get as far away as you can. Andrew, I told you time and again, that little house girl is the death of us. I said forget about all this and get us a maid that doesn't lay around all day. Finally. Now I'm happy. Because you're gone. Oh, my God! There's something... Oh. Oh, God. Oh, God. Mama? No, no! Maggie. Oh, God. Jason. Jason. Jason, no. Oh, my God, no. No! No, wake up. Oh, my God! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy, what's wrong? Run and hide before Mommy comes back. There's something wrong with Mommy. I'm so sorry. I-I-I don't know what's happening to me. I'm so sorry. You will pay for condemning me. I am Lizzie Borden. Society will pay.
