Keep dreaming if you want to eat today. Nothing to eat and sleeping on stones. I'm getting too old forthis. We must find work. Let me be the first to welcome you, Governor Pilate. You appear to be the only one to welcome me. Please make note of that, Governor. I am the only one to welcome you. A conqueror doesn't expect a warm welcome. These people don't accept that they've been conquered. Well, they will. Judea is the most troublesome province in the empire. So I've been told. And who are you? I am Livio, Roman citizen. And why are you here? Well, a kind man would say I am Caesar's historian. An unkind man would say that I am Caesar's... spy. ( laughs ) - Good morning, Mary. - It's a beautiful morning. Have Joseph and your son returned? No. I'm sure they must have found carpentry work in Jerusalem. God willing. God willing. Pontius Pilate! Most honored citizen of Rome! I, Herod Antipas, Tetrarch of Galilee, welcome you. ( applauding ) I accept your welcome, Herod Antipas. And Caesar sends his blessings on your land, and his kingdom. May I present my wife, Herodias, my stepdaughter, Salome, and your fellow Roman citizen, Livio. We've met. Please, come sit beside me. I must say, this city surprises me. In what way, Governor? The structures, they are most impressive. Built by my father, Herod the Great, beloved of his people. They hated him. A vicious man, I'm told. How distasteful of you to speak of my father this way. As his son, I am a hero to the people. The butt of all of their jokes. You misunderstand. In Rome, we call yourfather's way of ruling, "statesmanship." Perhaps Pontius Pilate would like to see the grandest of all structures in lsrael, the Temple, built by my father, a personal friend of Augustus, as I am a personal friend of Tiberius. How strange. I've never heard him mention you. I thank you for your welcome. And I will visit the Temple, as you suggest. Make sure you take your troops! And show their insignia proudly! Livio, whatdoes he mean, "show their insignia"? Well, I could tell you, but it would spoil all the fun. The High Priest of the Temple is Caiaphas, appointed by Rome, which puts him in a very interesting position on the one hand he has to appear to be on the side of his own people, but on the other hand he owes his position to Rome... a very narrow path to tread. Welcome, Pontius Pilate. I am Caiaphas, High Priest of this Temple. We come to wish you well, as you undertake the post of Governor of Judea. I thank you, priest. Allow me to get right to the point. Rome is displeased with the number of legions it has to keep in this barren land in orderto maintain peace. Your taxes don't begin to pay back the costs. You speak of the past. This disorder erupts directly from your corrupt religion, which erupts directly from this Temple. That ends today. My soldiers will be posted here every minute of every day from now on. This order defiles the Temple! Our religion forbids graven images in the Temple! Your soldiers are an abomination to the Temple. Even their flags break our laws. We allow no graven images, and your banners carrying the carvings of Caesar, these shields are symbols of Roman dominion! No building in Judea, not even the Temple, is exempt from the display of these symbols. What your religion forbids, Rome demands! We submit to yours words. Here is my bare neck! Let Rome cut it! We will die before we allow the Temple to be defiled. Governor... an awful lot of blood for your first day. Are you sure Rome would be happy... if you were to murder every priest in the Temple? Mary, stop staring at Jesus like that. He will never finish that door. We do love when the carpenters arrive, don't we, Mary? Because there is nothing worse than a door that squeaks. Is there anything else that squeaks? There is one thing that's broken, but it's beyond repair. I can repair most things. A broken heart? Martha, you've embarrassed Mary. And you've enchanted her. She's a beautiful girl. Woman. She's a woman, Jesus. And she needs a husband. Poverty, debt, hunger. The Romans say they bring us their world. All they bring us is misery. It's misery, Lazarus. At leastthey let us worship. The Temple still stands. For now. But the day may come when they decide to destroy it too... destroy us all. But enough gloom. Let's see if my son has done any work with your sisters distracting him. So, are we finished? Yes, "we" are almost finished, not that you had much to do with it. I'm the aging supervisor. It's my job to sit back and watch. Yes, well, you do it very well. Lazarus tells me that we will be paid highly for these repairs. Lazarus has never paid anyone "highly" for anything. I heard that snide remark from my sister. Joseph and Jesus are our blood relatives. Do you really think that I would let them work without pay? The truth, Lazarus? You will pay them nothing! Mary and l have worked all day to pay them in food and wine at dinner. And so, they shall be paid-- highly. No, no... It is enough. Don't be proud. You worked, I pay my debts. Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you again, Lazarus. -Jesus? - Yes? Mary's had an offer of marriage from a boy here in Bethany. I thought you'd like to know. She loves you. Surely you must know this. Why do you treat her as if her feelings mean nothing to you? - Lazarus, of course they do. - Then tell her! Mary! Lazarus just told me. It's not my idea. You know that-- Mary... please. I wish that... I wish you could understand. I feel that-- I feel that l... Have a safe journey, Jesus. ( knocking ) Open the door! Get out of the way! Where is your husband? He's working in Judea. He's in the hills hiding, Like the other men, to escape paying their taxes. Right, you owe one third of your income for two years. You were deferred last year... but no longer. Take the goat. Oh, please no! We won't have milk! The rest is due when I come back through this stinking village next month. If I had been here, I would have thrown that traitor out into the street. Joseph, no one could have done better. A Jew, working for the Romans! He should be ashamed. Ashamed! Come and eat. Please, come and eat. To think I've lived all this time, and itonly gets worse. When? When will there be an end to the suffering of our people? Are you asking me? Are you telling me that I can end the suffering? When will he act? He will know when it is time. How will he know? Joseph, stop talking like this. Two days ago, we saw a farmer leaving his house, losing everything he's worked for. We're not going to lose everything. God will provide for us. For him, too. Mother, I know what Father wants. - I know he thinks I should-- - He thinks... you should do what your heart tells you. Come back inside, please. Joseph! Joseph! Come, come, Jesus! Come! Father, are you all right? What happened? Jesus... Yes, I'm here. What is it? I've loved you. I've loved you... as my own. ...as my... Joseph, no! ( wailing ) Father, this is too heavy. Now, when I am in the most need, you take him from me? You want me to step out, but you leave me alone. How can you ask this of me? Alone? I have never been without him. You can give him back to me. You can do it now. Give him back to me! Now! Give him to me! I am in need! I cannot walk this road alone! Raise him, raise him up into my arms. Let it be your will, Father. I cannot do this alone! Raise him. Raise him! It's all in the hands. Mine are not as talented as his. Jesus, he loved you. I disappointed him. He thought he disappointed you. How? He knew you had a Father in Heaven. Joseph is my father. Thirty-one years ago I had to tell Joseph something that just broke his heart. An angel? An... angel? I am a religious man, Mary. Don't blaspheme. It is the truth, Joseph. Out of all the places in the world... all the women in the world, God found you, in this little village? Just... just an angel. Just an angel... I think he thought I was crazy. He did not think you were crazy. He used to tell me that story all the time. He thought he was crazy when an angel appeared to him in his dream. No. He loved you with all his heart. And he loved you as if you were his own. I was his own. Now it's time for you to go and find the answers you need. And leave you alone? It is what your Father asks of you. You've given me so much joy. We heard about Joseph. How was the journey? It was long. A loss to us all. Yes, thank you, Martha. Could I have a moment with Mary? Certainly. Come, brother. - Mary. - Jesus. There's something I must tell you. You see, my father's death has ended my life as I knew it. And it's time now that I find my way. Where is your way? I can't be with you. - What have I done? - My life is not my own. What have I done to turn you away? It is not you. - You love someone else. - No, no. I am not who you think I am. I know who you are. And I know you love me as I love you. Mary, listen to me. You must live your life... without me. Jesus! Whatever it is... you have to do... safe journey. ( Man shouting ) We stand here. on the banks of the Jordan River where the people of lsrael once crossed so triumphantly in their God driven wanderings toward freedom! ( laughs ) Look at us today! Our leaders are weak and sinful. They fail to keep the spirit of the Covenant of the letter of the law. The prophet lsaiah said, "Wash yourselves... make yourself clean... remove the evil of your doings, learn to do good." Who will be baptized here today, to show the world that he is cleansed? Baptist, cleanse me. Come. All who wish to be baptized will be cleansed. Forthe Baptism signifies that your commitment has already been made... to hate injustice, and fight the battle of the righteous ones. I baptize you with water for repentance. ( laughing ) What's the matter, John? Don't you recognize your own relatives? Jesus? You are unrecognizable. I am? Look at yourself. I'm a prophet, crying out in the wilderness! Yes, and properly dressed for it! - Come, sit. -Thank you. Eat with us. This man is my blood, my family--Jesus, of Nazareth. Thank you, John. How long has it been? Twenty years? How are you? What are you doing now? How are Joseph and Mary? Joseph has recently died. I'm sorry. Mother is well. I am a carpenter. Joseph would be proud. Actually, Joseph wanted me to move on, to serve my God, as you are, John. You are welcome here, Jesus. Thank you. Joseph was a good man. He taught us both a lot. Remember our first trip to Jerusalem? Of course. Passover. This is the Holy Temple, and tomorrow we will go inside. But tonight, tonight help me make our camp, maybe there. Come. Look, isn't it beautiful? Through those doors is the Sanctuary. If you look closely maybe you'll see the golden menorah. At the back of the Sanctuary, is the inner most chamber, the Holy of Holies. ( praying ) Mary! We must go... if we are to reach home before dark tomorrow. I can't find Jesus. He's probably gone ahead with John. So we're leaving now. - Come, Mary. - I'm coming. I'm coming. Let's go, then. - Mary! - I'm coming, Joseph! He's not there. No one has seen him. - John? - He's asleep. They haven't seen Jesus since Jerusalem. You said he was with them. - Yes, I thought he was. - Well, he's not. Look here! I'll start on the streets. If you find him, wait here! - "lf"? - When! Jesus! Jesus! Excuse me, did you see a little boy...? The prophets tell us that this city and this place will be a light to all the people of the earth, because everyone will keep the Torah. The Messiah will be the prince of peace. The prophet lsaiah says, "They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning tools. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore." Your mother and I have been looking for you for three days! Three days! Child, why have you treated us like this? Why were you searching for me? Didn't you know I would be in my Father's house? Your Father's house, yes. Did you see the men hanging from the crosses on the way back? Terrible memory. The Romans got so bored at crucifying men, they started doing it upside down, justto entertain themselves. John... will you baptize me? If you confess your sins... and dedicate your life to God. Of course. Jesus of Nazareth, I baptize you with water for repentance. ( thunderclap ) Behold... the Lamb of God. Jesus... Jesus. The Spirit has brought you to me. Do you know why? To be tested. The Spirit has led you here and has allowed you to know what men feel when they are being tested by me. But to do this you must give up every privilege. You must be like them in every way, as fragile, alone and little as they are. Give up your shield. Abandon the protection of the power that abides in you. Empty yourself of your divinity. Empty yourself of the Father, Jesus. Without the protection of the Father? You know it is necessary. The Spirit tells you, not me. Only in this way can we challenge each other. I am willing. ( screaming ) Welcome to life, Jesus. You don't look so good, Jesus. - Are you hungry? - Yes. Command these stones to become loaves of bread. You mean call upon my Father's power? You have the power to command these stones, don't you? I am only his Son. But you have the power! ( laughs ) And if I use it in this way I will fail his mission. He has asked me to bring his word to man, not to crush them with his power. I'm jus tasking for bread to relieve your hunger, Jesus. Men have hungers. Feed your starving people, Jesus. Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God. You're missing the point, Jesus. You have the power to solve mankind's problems. Feed these people. Many are starving. - You can feed them. - I was sent to feed them the truth. - They hunger for bread, Jesus. - No, they die of hunger, because of hearts of stone of other men, not because God wills it. And you can change all that. And so they are to listen to you, hmm? A peasant from Nazareth? You and only you have the truth... sent from God? Others have spoken the truth. And men have destroyed all of them for a thousand years. Butyou... you, they will listen to, hmm? Why? They will. And just how will you do that, Jesus? How will you get them to listen to you? So, I'm going to help you. There is but one way to make them notice you, Jesus. You must convince them that you are sent by God. Throw yourself down and he will command his angels to catch you. Then they will see that you are someone to listen to. They would listen then, wouldn't they? They would listen to someone who could do that. That's not my Father's will. If he wanted me simply to test his laws, nature's laws, he would not have sent me. Don't test God for your own purposes. Jesus of Nazareth, Jesus of Jerusalem, Jesus of Egypt, Jesus of Bethany, Jesus of Bethlehem. - Where else have you been, Jesus? - Nowhere. No. So, you cannot understand the stakes! Let me show you. Power, Jesus, power! Not second in command, but number one. You have never felt that power. I have. You've never been able to until now. Now you can be number one. Do you know what that means, Jesus? No. Power is what every man wants more than anything else in the world. They kill for it. There is nothing more precious, and it is yours to have. How? Bow down to me, Jesus, just once. In all of existence, before and aftertime, just once, Jesus. It's a small price. Consider the reward. Away with you, Satan! For it is written, "Worship the Lord, your God, and serve only Him." I will not create a human kingdom by becoming the most powerful, but by being the poorest. For I am the Lamb of God. See you again, Jesus. It's only just begun. Do you think he's coming? Hmm? If he's been out there all this time he hasn't survived. If he hasn't survived, he isn't who we thought he was. Go home if that's what you want. Do you think he really is the one? It's him! Rabbi! Rabbi! Why do you call me this? We were there, Rabbi, when you were baptized. And John the Baptist called you the Lamb of God. You are the Messiah. Are you sure? - Yes! - No. ( laughing ) How did you find me? John the Baptist told us where your mother lives. What do you want? To be your followers. Rabbi, where are you staying? Come and see. Oh, Jesus...! How long have I been sleeping? Two nights and one full day. I was dreaming of this bed, this house. Joseph was here. Those two young men waiting for you... what do they want? ( chuckles ) To be my followers. Good. Maybe I'm not ready, Mother. In Bethlehem, in that stable behind the inn, kings came to bow down to you, carrying precious gifts-- frankincense, myrrh, and gold. Those men did not travel all that way, following that star, without the will of God guiding them. What's this? This is beautiful. Did you make this? It is a wedding present for your cousin, Benjamin. Little Benjamin is getting married? Yes. Let's go! And your followers? Friends! We're going to a wedding. - The Baptist said he is the one. - That's not enough. If you do not approve of my son, why do you follow him? Our people are slaves to Rome. Our freedom fighters are being killed and this is how he spends his time? - He is a man. - Yes... and I fear, nothing more. We are fishermen. Our brothers are working right now on the Lake of Galilee. We should be there working with them. What for? To make money? Life has gotto be more than that. We went looking for answers, and we met him. And you follow him? - Should we? - Yes. Why? I am so thirsty. I shall fetch you wine. What's the matter, Andrew? You don't dance? I'll dance... when lsrael is free and men are honest. That will be a very slow dance. ( laughing ) It will not come a tall if we wait for you. I thought when I found John the Baptist that-- Andrew! But he said you were the one. And you spend your time drinking wine and dancing! There is no wine left. Andrew, I'm sorry I have disappointed you. - I was only-- -Jesus? There is no wine left. Yes, Mother, what concern is that to me? Perhaps you could provide...? My hour has not yet come. It is time. Jesus will help you with the wine. There is no wine left. Just do exactly what Jesus says. Andrew needs to know. The world needs to know. Could you please fill those jugs over there with water? - With water? - Yes, with water. - Yes. - Thank you. Jesus, the jars are filled. Draw some out and take it to the bride groom. Impossible. Drink, Andrew. The cup you desired is here. He is the one, Andrew. Have no fear in following him. Anyone who has two coats... must share with those who have none! Anyone with food, must do likewise! Tax collector! Collect no more taxes than those prescribed for you! Herod! Antipas! Come out! Herod Antipas! Ruler of these people, come out! I have heard from the corners of lsrael of you, John, son of Zachariah. And I've come to hear your message. You must repent, Herod Antipas, for the sins that you have committed to your people! I come in peace, John. What "sins" do you speak of You live in sin with this woman, Herodias! Hold your tongue, "prophet"! You are married to his brother, and yet you lay with him! You're a liar! He's a filthy liar! I want to hear your words, John, but I cannot allow you to insult my wife. You are a sinner! Put away this woman! Confess your sins! Arrest this liar! We're leaving. - No... - Salome! You can turn your back on me, Herod Antipas, but not on God's judgement! Go. Beware, one who comes after me will cleanse with fire! James! Simon! We're back! You go off without saying anything, leave me to do all the fishing. It's a good thing James was here. We've found him! Now you return, grinning like an idiot. - Can't you feel it? - All I feel is wet. Can't you feel his presence? Are you possessed? What are you talking about, Andrew? Look... there. The Messiah! Have you gone mad, too? The quiet one is James. The loud one at the stern is Simon. Have you been telling my brother that you're the Messiah? - Are you a rabbi? - He's a carpenter. Where are you from? Nazareth. - Nazareth? - Yes, Nazareth. Can anything good come from Nazareth? ( laughing ) Your boat is empty. We've been working all night while these two followed you around, searching for... Whatexactly was it you were searching for? If you took me out I could fill your nets. Climb aboard, "Messiah." The "Messiah" is going to fill our boat. Where are the fish, "Messiah"? Further out, where it's deep. - Ha, that's original! - Simon, he's the one. I've seen him change water into wine. Really? Andrew, scoop up some lake water, I could use a cup of wine. Scoop up one for me, too. Cast your nets here. Now. James... I'm only going to do this so you won't waste your life following this jackal. What do you think, James? Should we drag the net, or just let it sink? I don't know. Ask the carpenter, he knows everything about fish! Pull it in. Pull it in? It's only been in the water-- Pull it in. Of course. James, pull it in. Stop laughing and help us! What kind of man are you, that you can command the fish in the water? Come with me, Peter... I'll make you a fisher of men. My name is Simon. Wait, wait, wait! Is it all right if we drink from your well? -Thanks. - Yes. You are from Nazareth, yes? I saw you at the wedding in Canaan. They said you made the wine from water. Is that true? Did you do that? Yes, he did that. He changed the water into wine. - I saw it. - I saw it. This is the one. Jesus of Nazareth. He changed the water into wine! Sir... man of Nazareth. If you can do that, can you heal my son? Come. Please, I beg of you. Wait! This man is a fraud and a false Messiah! Believe. He is the chosen one! He comes here to steal your money! Yes! Every week the same thing! ( angry clamor ) Quiet! Quiet! Listen to the Master. Do you believe I can help you? Yes. ( outcry ) Rise up and walk! ( weeping ) He's the Messiah. - Did he really do that? - You saw it! Yes, I saw it, but I don't believe it. Believe it! Believe it! - What's your name? -Thomas. Come with us, Thomas. Follow the Messiah. Come! I have given you your wish. He can speak against you no more. You fill your palace with graven images, and you forget your God! Cut out his tongue and feed it to the dogs! Live by the Word of God! Oh! Roman pig! Open the door. Caesar comes to collect his taxes. "Caesar" comes? My, how the mighty have fallen. - Your taxes are due. - Have you no shame? You, a Jew, doing Rome's dirty work? Your taxes are at work, building and repairing roads, aqueducts-- And they are lining your pockets! Do you wish to pay, or do you wish to have these men take you away? ( laughing ) Zealots. Zealots! Zealots! They're coming! Stop! Stop! Who says this? - Jesus of Nazareth! - Oh, yes... the latest "Messiah." I've heard of you. Will you save your people, "Messiah"? Spilling blood won't save them. Spilling enough Roman blood will. The stones of Israel are covered with blood, still we are enslaved. You will change nothing until you remove the blood from your hands. I am Barabbas. Maybe you need a bit of blood on you. No! No! Do you love me now, "Messiah"? This is what Rome does to your people, every day. Strike me again. And when you have exhausted yourself-- When I have exhausted myself there will be legions more to strike. - Exactly! When does it stop? - When we are free. You will be free when you learn to love. Clever words. Nothing more. Don't fill my people with your empty promises, "Messiah." I'll be the one to free the people of lsrael, Jesus of Nazareth! And I'll do it with a sword. You cry over Roman blood? Human life! Romans are not human. Your hate will only harm you, friend. Hate can be a useful weapon, used correctly... and I'm not your friend. Wait... Is your lsrael free now that these men are dead? No. Then follow me. I will show you how to be free. I am the way. You! Tax collector! What is your name? Levi, son of Alphaeus. Well, now your name is now Matthew. Do you wish to kill this collector of Caesar's taxes? Follow me, Matthew. Where? To your home. Come Judas, son of Simon lscariot. Your fate is with me. How did he know my name? Follow him, and find out. ( chattering ) This food... it was bought with stolen money. I told him that! Bless you. Matthew, thank you for your hospitality. Rabbi, why do you do this? Do what? Eat with me... a tax collector. Don't you see how they hate me? And they are right. I despise myself. Why? I steal from them... from all of them. Then stop. Give back everything, and come with me. It's simple. James, Peter, you're not eating. It's very good. I'm trying to love him, Rabbi. I really am. Keep trying, Peter. Keep trying. ( drums and cymbals ) Happy birthday, my King. ( cheering ) Wonderful, Salome! Delightful! A gift, worthy of a gift. Give her whatever she wants! I hope it's me! ( laughing ) Whatever you want. I pledge it to you tonight, Salome. Anything? Anything. ( cheering ) Come now, that's not fair, Salome. Your mother's desires are far too expensive. ( laughter ) Anything? Now, my dear, it's just a dance. You promised! "Anything", you said! Pay up, Herod Antipas! Anything. I want the head of John the Baptist. But, my dear-- Will you not rid me of this vermin?! Bring me the head of John the Baptist. On a platter! I forgive you. I will live again in the kingdom of heaven. ( drumming and clapping ) Water! Andrew, friends, come. Water! Andrew...! ( laughter ) ( screaming and shouting ) Adulteress! Shame on you, adulteress! Caiaphas! All right, all right. Jared... I've heard this Joseph of Nazareth, has just entered the city. "Jesus" of Nazareth. Only moments ago. Is this the one who claims to be the Messiah? He is one of the ones who claims this, my lord. Good. Take the girl to him, and ask this "Messiah" to judge her. Test him in front of the people. Show him to be a charlatan, and they will lose interest. We have to expose these fakes. They are dangerous men. Bring her. The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure, buried in a field. And when you find this treasure-- ( angry voices ) Stone the adulteress! Adulteress! She's an adulteress! Teacher! This woman was caught in the act of committing adultery. In the law, Moses commands us to stone such women. What do you say, Teacher? They are baiting him. It's a trap. I was told you preach according to the law of Moses. Do you have an answer, Nazarene? Let anyone among you who is without sin... be the first to cast their stone. ( crowd murmurs ) There is no man here who condemns you? No one, my lord. Neither do l. Go your way. And from now on, do not sin again. I want to see the Temple. I'll tell you more tomorrow. Do you want to come with us? Where? Does it matter? Yes. I go where I want. I'm free. You're not free. But you could be. Why don't you come with us? You treated her like... Iike she was worth something. So are you. ( chattering ) Change your coin to temple currency! Purest gold! Pure gold! I have the best price-- This is my Father's house! My Father's house is a house of prayer, not a house of trade! We pay tithes, butthey care more about Caesar than about God! They have forgotten the Word of God! Do you say that we should not pay taxes to Rome? Stop! That's my money! Who's image is on this coin? Caesar! Then give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and give to God what is God's! I will make this the house of God again! ( yelling and protesting ) ( cracking ) Get out! Get out of here! This is the renewal of lsrael! Take these things out of here! Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father's house a mocked place! Hear, hear, you ignoble guests of the great and gracious Pilate! Listen now to me, and imagine the scene! ( laughter ) Behold, the great Temple of Jerusalem! Ah...! Ah-hh! The Temple is brimming with Passover pilgrims! The cries of the money-changers! "Change your money Give your money!" Shhh! Shhh! And then suddenly, a voice... a voice of righteous anger. Jesus! Jesus! Jesus! My Father's house is not a house of trade! ( laughter ) The Temple is corrupt. You have all forgotten the Word of God. Enter a priest. It's Caiaphas! How dare you accuse us! You are nothing but a carpenter from Nazareth! We are the Temple elite. We answer only to God. And to Rome, in the person of Pontius Pilate. Ah-hh! And then, a trap! And then, a trap! Do you say we should not pay taxes to Rome? To which the carpenter said, "Who's face is on this coin?" Caesar's! Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God! I won't crucify him for that! ( laughter ) Livio! Livio! Livio! Oh, bravo. Bravo, citizen! Ah, the Jews... such a... such a strange people. What is it about them that craves these messiahs? What does the word mean, anyway? "The anointed." The king from the line of David promised by God. Oppressed people need to believe in a deliverer. Well, they'll just have to be content with "governor" for now. "King" is a little showy, don't you think, Livio? Not for you, Your Majesty. I love they way you kiss up to me, Livio. It's so...justified. He needs food and water. He's been sitting up there for five hours. I offered it to him an hour ago. He waved me away. You rushed up like a wild camel. He's still mourning John the Baptist. You don't go rushing up to him like that. Just because I'm a fisherman, that doesn't make me stupid, Judas. -You said it, not me. -Why don't you both shut up! You shut up! I'm tired of you bossing everyone around! And I'm tired of you acting like a bully. Stop it! Look! What do you think they want? For you to speak. Do you think I have anything to say? Sitdown everybody. Sitdown, please. Come along, sit. Jesus will speak to you. Blessed are the poor, for they will inherit the kingdom of heaven. I'd like to inherit something right now! ( laughter ) The rich and the powerful think they own the world. And actually, they do. But what can they buy with all that money? Everything! ( laughter ) Wealth does not buy life. It does not buy a good heart. And it cannot buy the kingdom of God. You can have it no matter how poor you are. Very poor! ( laughter ) If you hunger and thirst for righteousness you will be satisfied. But how? How? What do you want from your God? Mercy! Yes-- then show mercy. Love. Then show love. A new house! ( laughter ) No taxes! ( laughter ) Remember the prophets? They were persecuted, but they didn't lose faith. Meet it with love. And follow the law of Moses! The law? Yes! Don't worry so much about what you eat and drink. What comes out of your mouth is more important. This is what can really harm you for eternity. Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breast that nursed you. Blessed rather are those who hear the Word of God and obey it. You are his mother? Yes, I am Jesus' mother. I'm sorry for the pain he caused you today. Well, he didn't mean to. But he did. Men always do. Are you one of his followers? I'm a prostitute. I do not judge. I have been judged too, in my life. He scares me. Pretty funny, huh? A prostitute afraid of a man. That is because... in him there is something greater than any man. Would you like to walk with me? - What does he want? - I don't know. He told me to gather his closest followers, and wait. Wait for what? Why don't you have a little patience, Simon? Peter. My name is Peter. He called me Peter. "Peter, Peter, Peter." I love you all. Most of you have been with me from the beginning. But now the crowds have grown too large for me alone. I need men to share my power to minister to those in need. And so, I am going to pick twelve who will have the authority to proclaim my message. ( murmuring ) Peter... John... ( murmuring ) and brother James. Sons of thunder. Andrew... Judas... Matthew. ( low grumbling ) The tax collector? Thomas... Philip... Bartholomew... James, son of Alphaeus. Taddeus... Simon. I give you authority over unclean spirits. Cure the sick. Cast out demons. Take nothing with you... as you meet people. No bread, no bag, no money. Your mission begins in this world, and is fulfilled in the next. You are my apostles. Go to the other side | and wait for me Please, I need to rest for a while. Please go home. Just for one night. I need to get some rest. ( distant thunder ) We're sinking! ( shouting ) I can't swim. In this storm, it doesn't matter! Are we going over? Why don't you ask our great captain? Bail! I'm bailing! Bail! I'm bailing! It's a ghost! Don't be afraid! Lord... if it is you, command me to come to you on the water. Come! - No, don't go, Simon! - I want to go. ( thunderclap ) Lord! Save me! Save me! Lord, save me. Save me. You of little faith! Truly, you are the Son of God. When he speaks, multitudes come. Multitudes? Let's not exaggerate. Five thousand, at least. They say he fed them all with one basket of fish. Do you mock me? It is said that he is a relative of John the Baptist. The Baptist? Whom you killed. Didn't the Baptist say that he would live again? Weren't those his last words? And what if it's him... come back to destroy me? Perhaps. Just raise your hand, and crush him. Guard! Jesus! Have mercy on me! My daughter's tormented by a demon! Have mercy on my daughter! Send the Canaanite away. She has no place here. Jesus! Please, have mercy! You are not a Jew. I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of lsrael. Jesus, have mercy! Have mercy, Lord. Please help me. It is not fair to take children's food and throw it to the dogs. Yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table. Woman... great is your faith. Your daughter is healed. Go and find her. Bless you, Jesus of Nazareth! Master, our God is for the Gentiles? I saw a dying girl. Would you rather I let her die? This woman has taught me... that my message is for the Gentiles as well. If I can learn, so can you. Mary... Come. Son, this is a new friend of mine... Mary Magdalene. She wishes to join us. I know Mary. I am a prostitute, Jesus. You were... once... a long time ago. Your father would be so proud. Which one? Both. There's 30 pieces of silver in there, and plenty more where that came from, if we put our minds to it. Give it back. ( laughter ) I can't give it back. It came from many different people. Then give it away to the poor. After what it took for me to get it? Didn't you hear what I just said? Give it to the poor. Help us! Please, help us! Help me! We're starving! A gift from the Messiah! - Jesus! - Yes. Jesus, do you remember me? I am Zerah. We met in Bethany. Yes, of course, I remember you. Lazarus is dying! Mary and Martha have sent me to find you. They beg of you. Come quickly! Thank you, Zerah. Thank you for the message. You can ride behind me. We will be there before the sun sets. You go ahead. But, Lord, he is gravely ill! You go ahead. You're not going to come? You're going to help? I'll come when the time is right. They said... you were their friend! Lord, you have spoken of Lazarus many times. If you need to go to him, you must. He heals strangers, but does nothing for his friends. It smells so good. My father... taught me how to get the best wood from a tree like this. Were you a good carpenter? It's a good thing I started preaching. See, Joseph used to say that only his hands were educated. That wasn't true. He was the wisest man I've known. Wise and generous. He would give his last crust of bread to a stranger. Even to a Gentile? You question me too, Mary? No. Never. I would never question you. But you question yourself. I just don't understand how you could believe in someone like me. God forgives you, Mary. If I were a man I would be your most loyal disciple. Those who speak for me are my disciples. Lazarus was a good man, Mary. - Yes, he was. - It's a great loss. Your brother will rise again. Resurrection day? I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me will live. Do you believe this? I know who you are, now. Jesus! If you had been here, Lazarus would not have died. Where have you laid him? Lazarus has died... so you may believe! You... take the stone away. Jesus! It has been four days. Take the stone away! Father... I thank you for having heard me. Lazarus, come out! He mocks us with a "show." Trust Jesus, Martha. Someone should stop this. It's a cruel joke! ( screams ) It's a miracle. Unbind him. God be praised! ( pounding ) Silence! Silence! Raised from the dead?! I was there, Caiaphas. I saw my friend Lazarus come out of the tomb. I smelled the rotting flesh, but he walked out of the tomb alive! A dead dog thrown in the cave just before it was closed. I marched with the funeral procession! I watched the body being put into the tomb, and the door shut and sealed. Examine the evidence... Jesus and Lazarus are old friends. The sister is in love with Jesus, by your own account. - True. - So, think! Who better to concoct this story with? Lazarus pretends to be dead. He spends a few nights in the cave. The High Priest is right. All it takes is one "raising from the dead" story to make this Jesus a legend. And suddenly, he is "the Messiah." There are reports of another raising, a child. There are always reports. That's how these false prophets live... on "reports"! Gossip is their lifeblood! No one... no one can defeat death. Think! You know nothing at all. How can a gentle man who teaches the laws of Moses and keeps our traditions be a danger? A man who loves our people, and gives them the courage to live a hard life. Word is spreading among the population that the Messiah has arrived. They will rise up against Rome! And the Romans will crush the revolt! ( uproar ) Only this time, they will crush us along with it! We are the peacekeepers, and if no peace is kept, Rome will destroy the Temple, along with the nation. Pilate has made that clear. You... you... you. You will die! And along with you, the blood of Abraham, Moses, and Elijah. We cannot allow this because of one false "Messiah"! Judas lscariot, do you know us? You were with Barabbas. Barabbas has been arrested. The Zealots have been driven into the mountains. But your rabbi could rally them once again. There is an army waiting. This triumphant entry into Jerusalem-- On a donkey in torn robes, it's brilliant! It makes Herod and Pilate look like the asses they actually are. When will Jesus call for revolution? Soon. Soon. We'll be watching for the right moment, Judas. - Praise Jesus! - Praise Jesus! This man must be arrested. In the middle of this ridiculous festival... Passover. No, no! Block, then thrust, Giannario! Whoever heard of a festival to celebrate that your own god didn't destroy you. -These Jews are mad. -These Jews are dangerous! I can't arrest their current hero while there are thousands of them in town. I'd have a riot on my hands. Think, Livio! Then do it at night. Find someone to betray him. Get him alone, I don't care. But if you don't stop him, he's going to bring Rome down on us all. He must be stopped-- dead! I thought you were a better politician than this, Livio. Paolo, teach him to counter that attack! If there is another rebellion in this miserable place, Rome will throw both of us to the lions! I could kill this "Messiah" tomorrow... and there will be another right behind him. - Or... - Or? We could see to it that he becomes a problem for some of his own people, and they could solve the problem for us. Bravo, Giannario! Master? Master, may I speak with you? Yes. Lord, there will never be a better time to strike against Roman power in Jerusalem. There is an army of Zealots waiting. The city is full of pilgrims for Passover. They believe in you. Rise up, ask them to attack the palace, they will. Sheer numbers will overwhelm the Roman guard, and once we are in charge, Rome will leave us alone. Now is the time. Surely it is your destiny. In two days... it will be Passover. In two days, I will be killed. Please, God! Not now! No. No, my Lord! No, it cannot be. Lord, the Zealots will join with your followers. Thousands at your command! Freedom, not just from the Romans, but from all tyranny. The tyranny of sin, Judas. That is my battle, not the Romans. Then you are betraying your people, not saving them. You are the one man who has the power, and yet you refuse? That's betrayal! I'm not here to lead a violent revolution, Judas! You may have no choice. God forbid it, Lord! It must happen, Peter. No, Lord. I will not let it happen! - None of us will! - It is God's will, Peter. No, Lord, it cannot be. You must prevent this! I cannot allow myself to prevent it. I must do as my Father has commanded. No, Lord, you cannot die. Your mission is only beginning! - Peter-- - You cannot let this happen! I will fight with all my strength. Satan! Get away from me. Why? It's why I was born. To die? Now? To prove God's love. How? How is that love? I have to give everything. Nothing held back... so they will know. It's too much to pay for an animal to be sacrificed. Then go away, ignorant Galilean. I have every right to worship in the Temple. A sacrifice is required. Buy or go away! You control this only because you lick the boots of Rome! You fool! ( woman screams ) The Romans have spilled the blood of our brothers, and in the grounds of the Holy Temple! And do you know why this happened? Yes, because Rome rules this city, and now the Temple. They appointed you, and now they own you, Caiaphas. It happened because of Jesus of Nazareth! Because of the Romans! These men who attacked the priests were from Galilee, Nazareth. They would never have had the strength or the will, except for this Jesus. He makes the people think they can overthrow Rome. Have you forgotten what he did at the Temple? Kicking over the tables! These Galileans are following his lead! The speeches inflame the people. He has followers, armed and ready to attack the Romans at any minute! Is that what you want? I want you gone from this council! You blame everyone but yourself. I will not stand by and watch you destroy us. I am withdrawing until you come to your senses and resign. As I told you before... if we let this man continue, the people will say the Messiah is here, so they will rise up against Rome again. And the Romans will crush the revolt. It is better for you to have one man die for the good of the people than to have the whole nation destroyed. Jesus of Nazareth... must die. There are rumors in the streets, priest! Rumors? Don't be coy with me! This man, Jesus, rides an ass into town, and is welcomed like a king! Herod wants to kill him, but does nothing, and you promise me you can keep peace in the Temple, but I had to use swords! - Rome will not be silent forever! - These false messiahs-- Don't speak to me of messiahs! I don't care about your religion, I care about peace! Peace, yes. I too, care about peace-- Well then, get control of this man! I fear my power is... limited. So you want me to do your dirty work for you? I have no choice. I cannot endanger lsrael for one man. Bring him to me. I will eliminate him. ( clapping ) Quick, quick! Come on! Quick! This is too dangerous. We should not be in Jerusalem. I will die with him... if this is what he wants. Take... eat. This is my body. Drink from it... all of you, for this is my blood... of the covenant, which is poured out for many... for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in remembrance of me. One of you will betray me. - No, no! - Not l, Lord, never! Not l, Lord! Nor l, Lord. Nor l, Lord! Do what you have to do... do it quickly. Where is he going? My kingdom is coming. After three days, I will rise again. I am told you have something to say to me. I know where he is. I can deliver him to you. And the price? You think I'm a beggar? A thief? Then why do you come to me? Aren't you one of his followers? I am one of his disciples. He chose me himself. Then why do you betray him? He's not the man I thought he was. You want to pay me, eh? Thirty pieces of silver. Done. Lord, where are we going? We should have stayed in the room. What if we are seen up here? You know they want to kill you! Not now. Rabbi... if all of your followers become deserters, I want you to know I will never desert you. Peter, tonight, before the dawn, you will betray me three times. Never. Even if I must die with you, I will never betray you. Sit here while I go over there and pray. John, Andrew, Peter, James, come with me. - Master, I will never-- - Not now, Peter. I am deeply grieved. What I face now would be difficult for any man... and I must face it as a man, to fulfill my pledge. Wait here, and stay awake with me, while I go overthere and pray. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. My Father, if it is possible, let this pass from me. Yet, not what I want, but what you want. He is out at the Mount of Olives, in a garden called Gethsemane. I followed him there with his men. I'll take you there. How many are there? Twelve. How will we know which one he is? The one I kiss is Jesus. My Father... if this cannot pass unless I drink all of it, then your will be done. But if there is another way... I am so afraid I cannot endure this, my Father. The final act begins, Jesus. There will be no reprieve handed down from your Father. He's willing for you to go through this, every painful step of the way. If it is his will. His will? His will for you is to be flogged, spit on, humiliated, dragged through the streets, laughed at, tried, convicted and crucified. You've seen crucifixion, but you've never felt it. You've never felt the pain of nails through your hands, of nails through your feet. It's agony. It's hours in agony. The weight of your own body crushes your lungs, and you'll suffocate, slowly. And you will endure this alone. Look at them over there. They can't even stay awake. And they'll run, as soon as Judas shows up. You know I'm right... and it's all in vain, Jesus. No, no... not in vain. Through me God will reveal his love for mankind. God? That unseen, heartless, burn-in-hell, watch-your-children-starve God? Not in vain. Oh, yes... in vain. Let me show you-- the future. Crusades, in your name. "Jesus Christ" they shout, when they kill. In the name of Jesus Christ! In the name of Jesus Christ! Killing for Christ will be a big business through the centuries, Christ Jesus. And this is what you're dying for. This is what your agony will give them. another reason to kill and torture each other. Don't you think they have enough reasons already... It's so easy. th It is so easy Jesus, just ask him to come get you. The world at war! Why? Why? Who knows? That guy doesn't like the pimple on the nose of that guy-- but you can stop it. Tonight! You can stop it. Come down off that cross they have waiting for you. Why die in agony when you can take control? Make the earth a paradise! End poverty! End hunger! End war! You can do it! It's within your power, right now. - No, I cannot. - Oh, yes, you can. It is not God's will. It is not God's will to end a war? What kind of a God is that? One who loves mankind so much that he gives them freedom of choice. He hasn't created them so that he can be their dictator. He gives them the choice of doing good or evil. And this is what they choose. Yes. I forgive you. I don't want your forgiveness. Look, here comes Judas and his mob. Jesus, you don't even have to bow down to me. I'm not even asking you that. Just call to your Father, and ask him to deliver you. Tell him you don't want this. He won't make you go through this, you know he won't. Just wave your hand, and you'll be home... safe. Do it-- now. You know what I showed you was true. You are going to die in vain. You don't know the plan. I do. I've seen it. Nothing changes. They don't have the capacity to love like you want them to. This will never happen. Just lift your hands, Jesus, and wave this all away. Go home, Jesus. Go home to your Father... now. Don't die in vain. Don't die alone. I am not alone. I'm with my Father. - You will die in vain, Jesus. - No! I am in the hearts of man. I will die for the everlasting kindness of the human heart created by the Father, so that men will make his image shine once again, And those who will want to, will find in me the strength to love until the end! Friend... do what you are here to do. Betrayed with a kiss. (jeers and shouting ) You-- I know you. You were with him! He was with the great "Messiah." You're a fool! You are the fool! You followed him around like a dog! I never saw that man before! I don't know what you're talking about! He claims to be the Messiah. His disciples claim he raised a man from the dead. - lmpossible! - Not when you are the Son of God. - Is that who you claim to be? - Is this a trial? It is our duty, Seth, to protect the Temple from false prophets. Your duty, brother Jared, is of no concern here. You fear him because the people listen to him, because he asks us to become better Jews. Who do you say you are? Be careful what you say. Answer. Do you claim to be the Son of God? It is you who says it. He admits it! Blasphemy! You cannot deny it! This man was with Jesus of Nazareth! You're a liar. ( laughing ) You false prophet! Take him to Pilate! I swear, I don't know what they are talking about! ( rooster crows ) I can't. I can't watch them hurt him. If you believe in my son. you will stand by him, with me. Caiaphas, what are you doing coming here at this hour? We bring you Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus? So this is the one who makes a mockery of Herod Antipas, and causes my High Priest to tremble. Jesus of Nazareth, I am Pontius Pilate, Governor of Judea. I know who you are. Well, what accusation do you bring against this man? Blasphemy, punishable by death. Blasphemy against what? Your god? - Yes, my lord. - This is not a crime against Rome. But he also proclaims himself as king. He denies Rome's power in this land. Oh, Caiaphas, stop wasting my time. Take him and judge him according to your law! This crime, my lord, demands a death sentence. And only you can give this punishment. Leave him with me. Jesus of Nazareth. You have an interesting face. Are you the King of the Jews, Jesus? Do you ask this on your own, or did others tell you about me? I'm not a Jew! Your own nation and chief priests have handed you over to me. My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my followers would be fighting. Oh, so you are a king? I was born to testify to the truth. Really? What is the truth? Everyone wants to know the truth, Jesus. Do you know the truth? If I could find a man who knew the truth I would take him to Rome, and escape this burnt crust of a country. It's within my power. No. I didn't think so. Too much to ask. Bring him. I find no case against this man. This man is perverting our nation, forbidding us from paying taxes to your emperor, and saying that he himself is the Messiah, the king! Caiaphas... He stirs up people by teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee where he began, even to this holy city. He is from Galilee? Yes. Oh, well-- that comes under Herod's jurisdiction. I can't rule on a crime from Herod's people. And you're lucky, my friend. Herod just happens to be in Jerusalem for Passover. Go tell him the "truth." Take him to Herod. But, my lord-- Stop worrying, Caiaphas. It's a game, just a game. We have to have some fun occasionally. Jesus of Nazareth. This is Jesus of Nazareth. I've been wanting to meet you for a long time. Welcome. Livio, look, we are visited by Jesus of Nazareth. Behold, the "Messiah." I've heard all kinds of wonderful things about you. Livio tells me you can raise men from the dead. Not even John the Baptist ever raised a man from the dead. Livio, quiet. This is no ordinary criminal standing here. This is a man of God. I apologize for this Roman's behavior. You're a man of God, are you not? Yes, well... I heard wonderful things, healing the sick and such. I made a mistake with the Baptist. I never meant to have him killed. This man is dangerous to the entire country. He encourages rebellion against Rome. See, that's just a lie, isn't it, Jesus? I never heard anything like that. He calls himself the King of the Jews. Quiet, Livio. You will be King of the Jews. Is that true? Do you crown yourself "king"? See... see, that disturbs me, because I have the idea that I should be king of lsrael, not a dirty, uneducated prophet from Nazareth. ( laughter ) Oh, but, but I am willing to overlook all that, if you just show me a sign. Everyone is talking about you curing blind men and lepers. Lepers! Ugh! Oh, yes, darling... he is a-- supposedly he touches them, and they are cured. He touches the unclean? Yes. Get him out of here, and don't touch him. I'm only asking for a small sign. It doesn't have to be a big healing, it's just that this knee is causing me a lot of-- Don't touch him! Is that it, Jesus? Are you really going to stand there like a statue? He won't even speak to me. Silence can be a politician's best weapon. Kings must talk! Talking is a requirement, didn't you know that? There's never been a mute king. Behold the Mute King of the Jews! - Behold the King! - And get him out of here. Your Majesty! Your Majesty, do not let this charlatan escape! Exactly, a charlatan. What do you care? Even false prophets can have power. Let Rome handle it. Take him to Pilate. Take him to Pilate! Well, what a surprise. Jesus is back. You mean to tell me that Herod did nothing? As you predicted. Do you not hear the many accusations they make against you? Treason... claiming to be God... insurrection! Do you answer any of these charges? And now, we will let "the people" speak. You brought me this man, as one who was perverting the people. I have examined him in your presence, and have found him not to be guilty of any of your charges. He's guilty, Pilate. He's guilty! He's guilty! Passover? A custom at Passover. As is the custom at Passover, I as representative of Rome, release to you a prisoner. I give you Jesus of Nazareth. No! No! Yes! Yes! Yes! Just give us justice, Pilate! Not Jesus! Have you forgotten-- Don't you want me to release the King of the Jews? Yes! Release him! Yes! Yes! Release Jesus! No! No! Release Barabbas! Give us Barabbas! Barabbas! Barabbas! Barabbas! Barabbas! Do you hear what they want, Jesus? They'd rather have a murderer than you. Bring me, Barabbas. And flog this one. Come on, let's get out of here. I'm not going to stand by and watch a Jew beaten by Romans. Release Barabbas. Hail, the King of the Jews! Barabbas! Barabbas! Barabbas! I release Barabbas! ( cheering ) Without a sword you raised an army. You could have taken the city. I fought them, you wouldn't! So the sword will live to fight another day, "Messiah"! Hail! ( cheering ) Watch this. I've thought of the final blow. I am innocent of this man's blood. See to it yourselves. Crucify him. Make way. No pushing! Stand aside! Jesus...! Traitor! This is not what I wanted. It's not what I wanted! Do you think this is what I wanted? You sold him to the Romans. So that the people would rise up! For money! I was willing to die for him. He was the revolution. But he refused. I had to make it happen! I thought he would find his anger under the Roman whip. I thought the people would follow him and rise up! But he is allowing himself to die. The people have turned against him. Why? - You killed him! - And you... you abandoned him! I would have died for him. (screaming ) No! Jesus! Jesus, I'm here. Ohh-- Father, forgive them... for they know not what they do! We know exactly what we're doing, "Messiah." They've given him a place to stand. Why? So he will die slower. ( thunder rumbling ) My God! Why have you forsaken me?! Father... into your hands I commend my spirit. They've stolen his body! What? The stone was rolled away. They've taken his body! Taken? Who's taken his body? Peter, John, no! It's not safe! Gone! He is risen! Risen? No, the body is stolen! He said, "Afterthree days, I will rise again." Risen...? He's alive! Mary, he's alive! He said he would rise after three days. He's alive! We must tell the others. Come on! Woman, why are you weeping? If you carried my Lord away... tell me where you laid him. Please...? Mary. Teacher? Mary... you must let me go now. I haven't yet ascended to my Father. Now go to the others and tell them I'm alive. Mary, will you go and tell them for me? I don't understand... How could you see him? He's dead! I've seen him. Is it true, Mary? Yes... it's true. I've seen him. I talked to him. This is ridiculous. We saw him crucified! We buried him ourselves! How could he be alive? - How could Lazarus be alive? - How could blind men see? I'm sorry... but I don't believe that death is conquered that easily. There are too many other possibilities. He is the Son of God. Jesus himself said there would be false prophets. We have to be careful. This could be a trick! Thomas, you must believe. I want to, Mary. Believe me, I want to! But my mind won't let me. I will have to see for myself. Thomas... I saw him. Are you sure it was him? Did you see the wounds in his wrists? See? She can't be sure. Something else is going on here. Unless I see the mark of the nails-- no, unless I put my finger in the mark of the nails, I will not believe. Peace be with you. Thomas... put your finger here. My Lord, and my God! Yes, you believe because you have seen me. Blessed are those who believe without seeing. Now, go... into all the world, and preach what you have heard. Preach the good news. I am with you... Until the end of the world.
