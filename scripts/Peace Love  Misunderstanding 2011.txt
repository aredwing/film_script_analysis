Too oaky, I guess. - Diane-- - Is it California chardonnay or Californian chardonnay? - Diane-- - I never remember. I put Bruce next to Cindy because they worked together on the Callahan brief. You worked on that, right? Did they get along? Because l-- I can change it if they're-- Diane, I want a divorce. That's great timing, Mark. Thanks. Zoe's at Columbia, and Jake's not far behind. There's no reason to continue like this. Oh, you're an asshole. I'm not gonna fight about this. I can't fight you anymore. I was so happy she won the Tony. - Oh, me too. I thought she deserved it. - Mm-hmm. - Really? - Yes. Didn't you? I thought it was a very strange production. It just feels like Arthur Miller stopped trusting his audience at some point. I think even the best modern plays would benefit from some judicious trimming. It's true. We saw Shaw's Pygmalion a few years back, and it felt about 30 minutes too long. Eugene O'Neill's plays could be cut in half. Or better yet, abandoned altogether. Spoken like a true philistine. No, no, merely an optimist. You know, 12-Day Journey into Night. I'm taking the kids to my mother's in the morning. But you hate your mother. Fine. But we're doing this as soon as you get back. # There's a man who lives on the sun # # Who makes it hot for everyone # # Make you run aground # # Like a ship in the shallow # # Make your whole heart come undone # # And you'll come back as the soil # # Before you come back as a soul # # And you'll be worn away by the rain and the rivers # # Before you have the chance to go # # To the great unknown # # Oh-oh-oh # # Oh-oh-oh # # But you are not alone # # Oh-oh-oh # # Oh-oh-oh # # Being on your own # # Oh-oh-oh # # Oh-oh-oh # Is Grandma dying? I thought she was geeked out in some commune or something. Did Grandma OD? Mom, this really isn't cool. Are we gonna meet Grandma on her deathbed? Mom? Mom? Mom. # Being on your own # # Oh-oh-oh # # Oh-oh-oh # # Being on your own # # Oh-oh-oh # # Oh-oh-oh # Your father and I are getting a divorce. It's about time. Wait. Wait, are we gonna talk about this? Mom, seriously. What about an answer? This place is great. Badass. Hello? # Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme # # Between the water and the season # # Then she'll be a true love of mine # # Parsley... # I had a dream last night. I did. A little sparrow came to me with a broken wing. She didn't say anything-- being a bird. But she pried my mouth open with her beak and reached down my throat until it pulled a butterfly from my stomach, and two magnificent peacocks emerged. Then my little sparrow spewed out the butterfly, and the peacocks ate of it and begot beauty where once there was only bile. She's beautiful. What's her name? I prefer not to name animals. They're nature's children, not ours. I have some molasses somewhere. Are these all yours? Well, I'm not overly fond of possessions. Excuse me, honey. But if you mean were they created through me, then, yes, most of them. Whoa. - What do you think? - It's cool. Clichd liberal propaganda. I wouldn't say that. Oh, a kindred spirit. But I don't think either one does much to protect our freedom. How can you say that? Free press is the last defense of freedom in this society. No, the news has devolved into sensationalist infotainment, and violence is the antithesis of freedom. - What remarkable intelligence. Oh, there it is. You should really keep these things outside. I tried, but they follow me around like children to the Pied Piper. Besides, who am I to tell them that they can't stroll around as they will, hmm? Why chickens? Why humans? Ah, I got to recharge my... Oh, there's a lot of outlets upstairs. - Okay. - Mm. Why don't you settle in upstairs? You're gonna share a room with your brother. Seriously? Yeah, seriously. Yes. You know, um, you're a lot different than I thought you'd be. What? I don't see you for 20 years, and then I'm blessed with a prophetic dream. You've been through something traumatic. Can we please not talk about it? Please? Your soul has already told me everything I need to know. I'm gonna go tend to the kiln. You and the peacocks are welcome to stay, as long as you don't mind sharing the nest with a few other feathered friends. Stop. Stop it, or I'm gonna throw it out the window. God, I swear that thing's like your third arm. That's what she said. Seriously, it's obnoxious. Well, Zoe, you never know when life is gonna happen. - Where did you read that? An ad for an energy drink? No, I think it was for an erectile dysfunction drug. Still, it's true. And you have beautiful children. So much light in them. - Yeah. - And they're creative. That must drive the Virgo in you absolutely mad. How's this going for you? - Oh, I--I barter. I sell my art. Good. Mom, I have a favor to ask you. Well, what could I possibly deny my prodigal daughter? Well, I was hoping that, uh, while we're here, you could maybe, uh, keep your extracurricular activities under wrap. Oh, I don't sell pot anymore. - No... - What? Nothing. You're gonna call the DEA next time? No, I was talking more about the-- your amorous adventures. Look, honey, I... I know you're trying to protect your children, but you're fooling yourself if you think Zoe's never seen a penis before. Oh, God, please, will you just try and be responsible? That's all. Please? I will be a shining example of upright citizenship and constitutionality. So we have protests every Saturday. Protesting what? War, idiot. See, the government expects people to lose interest and burn out, so we have to stay involved. Vigilant! # Loose Lucy is my delight # # She come running and we ball all night # # Round and round and round and round # # And round and round # # Don't take much to get me on the ground # Okay, I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere. - # Yeah # - # Yeah # - # Yeah # - # Yeah # Yoo-hoo! Sorry I'm late, babe. What do you think is in the bag? Weed. There you go. Do you think Grandma's smoking the ganja? Yeah, probably. Her house reeks. Sweet. It sucks they're getting divorced. - You haven't been around. It's been bad. It still sucks. Do you feel responsible for their failed marriage? You gonna have, uh, daddy issues now? - Hey! Spielberg, knock it off. More like Werner Herzog. - What do we want? - Peace! - When do we want it? - Now! - What do we want? - Peace! - When do we want it? - Now! - What do we want? - Peace! - When do we want it? - Now! Here you go. - What do we want? - Peace! - When do we want it? - Now! - New recruits. Here, hold it up high. Peace! - When do we want it? - Now! - Hey! - Hey. Fuck you! Asshole! Sorry! Sorry. Oh, Jasper! Are you making a movie? Are you an actress? My name's Tara. Now! - What do we want? - Peace! - When do we want it? - Now! - What do we want? - Peace! - When do we want it? - Now! Zoe! - What do we want? - Peace! - Jesus, Mom. - Where's Jake? What-- - Mom, what are you doing? Put it down! Don't grab me! What are you looking at? Go! - When do we want it? - Now! The audacity. I mean, to drag you into her ridiculous politics-- But that's no excuse for killing Jake's game. Oh, please, he has no game. It's true. Grow a pair, will you? - I have a pair. They just don't get out much. Jesus Christ. No, I am not gonna go in there with that thing. - Yes, you are. Come with me. Don't be so melodramatic. - It's not melodrama. It's ethics. - It's a dead pig. - How can I help you? - Uh, what do you recommend? - Well, we move a lot of lamb chops. - Lamb. Wow. Could you pick on a more helpless animal? - Can I interest you in some veal? - I'll take a couple pounds of sirloin, please. Um, what else do you like here? How about those sausages? They look pretty good. - The sausage was made this morning, all organic. - Oh, okay. And I want to make lamb kabobs. You want to bone him, don't you? You want to T-bone him. - Yes? A war protest? Really? They are my kids, Mom. I don't want you filling their heads with useless crap. See, this is what you always do. Look at you. You're just like-- You barrel through people's lives, and you let everybody else pick up the pieces. - Your spirit guide brought you here, but she can only lead you to water. - Talk like normal people for once. Please? - I am so happy you're here, and I hope you're thirsty. - What are you doing? - Jake has a headache. - Then give him an aspirin. - No need. This is a less invasive remedy. - You can't heal him with rocks. - No, but you can with crystals. - There's science in action. - Some things transcend science, Mother. - Did you tell him that? - Shh, focus on the healing. Oh, I want to invite the protest team over for a little fiesta today. - Everybody? Like, everybody that was there yesterday at the protest? - Shh. Exclusion is an unnecessary violence, don't you think? Yes, unnecessary. Can I film? - Oh-ho-ho! It might be dangerous. There might be drugs. - Mom. - Oh, relax. It's just gonna be a little happening. I had the sweetest sex at this concert. It was so--oh. - Go back upstairs. - No way! - Now! - Oh, my God! Grace, is this Diana? - It's Diane. - What does enlightenment look like in the 21st century? - Welcome, welcome. Whoa. - I think it looks a lot like Krishnamurti and not... - Oh, oh. I'll see you in a sec. Jude. - Hi. - Somebody I absolutely want you to meet. - Okay. - Absolutely want you to meet. This is my gorgeous daughter, Diana. - Diane. - Diana. Like the goddess! - Oh, the goddess of the hunt. You must be a formidable woman. I'm a lawyer. - No, you see, I was a bit prophetic in those days, and I could feel the flinty nature of my Diana. - You're not a prophet, Mom. - Even in the womb. Oh, hush. I'm positively oracular. # In the thick of the evening # # When the dealing got rough # # She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff # - It's why collage was the medium of the 20th century. - Well, where does the perpetuation of fragmentation lead us? You know, it seems like we should be finding a way back into harmony with one another rather than representing and thereby replicating our division. - Hmm. - The art of seduction lies in the convergence of timing and atmosphere. Seize the moment. Mm. - It's only in recognizing the beauty in fragmentation... - That we can begin to transcend it. Right on. Excuse me. Oh, ew. You smoke too. Could you have any less respect for life? - Is now a good time to tell you that I hunt? - So what are you doing here? - I'm usually at the protests, but I had work yesterday, so... What are you doing here? - Grace is my grandmother. - Oh, wow. - Wow, what? - Grace is an institution. I mean, they say Dylan had a thing for her. - Bob Dylan? - No, the other Dylan. - Well, you know, there's Dylan Thomas. - Yeah, well, Dylan Thomas died in the '50s, so you do the math. # La, la, la # # You're better off with a... # - Hey, dude. How you doing? - I'm good. - See, cattle from small grass farms are essentially solar powered. They spread the seed, then they fertilize it with their manure, so it's a closed system, as nature intended. - Okay, but you're still killing a helpless animal. - Okay, first of all, I don't actually kill the cows. They typically come pre-slaughtered. - That's right. You merely dismember them. - And second of all, have you seen a cow? I mean, I'm pretty sure I'd lose in hand-to-hand combat. - Hand-to-hoof. - Shouldn't you be stalking some unsuspecting local girl? - I can't get romantically involved with my subjects, so... Can I film you? - Sure. Come up to the shop sometime. - Sweet. - Hey, there. The party's out there, you know? Why were you in such a hurry to leave the protest yesterday? - It's disrespectful to our troops. - You don't think it's more respectful to bring them home? I think it's pointless to debate foreign policy with a hippie. - Excuse me, but don't tell me that holding a cardboard sign and baring your breasts is ever gonna be a viable political tactic. - There were breasts? - No, no, no! This... He said this was a collaboration, and you can see the male influence there. - Is it true you had her arrested? - Do you always ask strangers such invasive questions? - I do if I want to get to know 'em. You know, you're something of a legend around here. Your mom talks about you all the time. - Let me guess. Tight-ass lawyer, who is in need of a soul transplant. - Actually, no. She's fonder of the details. You used to collect leaves. You liked the Beatles. - Everybody likes the Beatles. - That is true. All right, how about when you were a little girl, and you were scared, she would gather all the pillows from the house and pack them around you for protection so you could sleep. - Oh, Jude. Mary Ann wants to... Oh, am I interrupting something? - You're not interrupting. # The shine # # The shine # # The shine... # - Whoa. - Mom? Good morning. Mom! - Good morning. - Morning. - Huh. - You're up early. - You too. - That's what you have to say? "You're up early"? There's a naked man sitting next to my daughter, eating cereal. - It's okay, Mom. It's organic. - Jake, shut that thing off right now, or I'll beat you with it. - I'll be upstairs. Hey, it's nice meeting you all. - Oh, Jake and I want to go into town. Can I borrow the car? - Oh, take the Bug. I insist. - Thank you. - I hear Tara works at the coffeehouse on Tinker Street. Perhaps you will find sufficient time and atmosphere there, hmm? What do you think, hmm? # You're not the first to go # # You're not the first to make me want to say # # I told you so # # Now you're begging my forgiveness # # Like I'm the Lord above # # You're not the first to come back to my love # - Jake, she's not here. Why don't you go ask them when she's working? - Why'd you get so mad at Cole the butcher? - The answer's in the question. - What does that mean? - It means, he butchers animals for a living. So I have no patience for anyone who has no compassion for anything outside of themselves. - But you think he's hot, right? I mean, you want to procreate with him? - Right? Don't you? - You're so weird. - I know. - She was sitting on my computer. - You haven't told me yet how Mark is. - We're getting a divorce. - Aw, what happened? - Well, he just stopped... I don't know, and I just stopped caring. - I'm sorry. - Can we just leave the chickens outside? Okay? Thanks. Mom, it reeks of pot in here! Come on. Get down. Get off. Get off the couch. God. Hmm. Who is it? - It's not for me! - Here you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - You remember my daughter, Diana. - Like the goddess. - It's Diane. - Very nice to see you, Diane. - And then Hendrix comes onstage and starts to play, and my water breaks. - Oh, my God. - It's like she was being summoned from the womb by Jimi's guitar. - I hate this story. - That is awesome. - Uh-huh, but it wasn't until he started playing her song that Diana reared her screaming head. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. What was her song? - Guess. - Gypsy Woman. - What do I look like? - Voodoo Child. - Oh, man. I can see why you'd say that, but no. - I'm really disappointed, Jude. You're usually more intuitive. - All right, all right. Let me think. No. No, really? - Oh. - The Star-Spangled Banner? - Yeah. God. - See, my Diana was always destined for conservatism. - Patriotism, and there's nothing wrong with that. - Hey, patriotism inspired by Hendrix? There's bound to be some surprises. - In truth, there is no record of my being born at Woodstock. - I don't need a record. The truth is writ on my soul, among other places. - Mom, we don't need to hear about your other places. So, Jude, what do you do? - Uh, what, a man can't live on protest alone? - He crafts furniture. He's got really amazing stuff. - Wow. So you're a carpenter? - That's very sweet. Well, something like that, yeah. - Mmm. Did you go to college? Diana, don't interrogate him. - I'm not. - No, It's all right. It's all right. Um, I never was much for school. When I was young, all I wanted to do was play guitar and sing. I just wanted to be a musician. - Then you grew up. - Diana! - I'm... - Jude's a fantastic songwriter. - Oh. - Your mother is very generous with her superlatives. - Well, she does have a soft spot for musicians. - I just couldn't do it. I couldn't do the thing where you say this is mine and this is yours. I couldn't stand the thought of seeing my kids only three times a week. Oh. - You all right? - Yeah. When there's a death, you get a funeral. It's horrible, but you get to wear a black dress, and people bring you food and... - I do like a good casserole now and again. - But when a marriage dies, you get endless debt, paperwork, and just a life you don't even recognize. - I don't mean to change the subject on you or anything, but this is perfect. - I used to swim here. When my mother had these epic parties, I would come down here and swim at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning. I couldn't take it anymore. - You see there? I knew there was some hippie in you. - Take it back, or I'll sue you for slander. - Why you always got to fight with me? - I'm a lawyer. I have to keep my fists up. Oh, um... You know, I'm-- I think you misunderstood me. - Yeah, no. I didn't. - Oh, God. Oh, my God. How is it? - Ah, it's your turn. - No. Okay, don't look. - All right. - Oh, my God. Okay, here I go. I... Oh, I forgot to let go of my dress! Yes, you did. - It's amazing. - Not bad. Not bad at all. - And then the Dead came back at the top of the second set. And out of nowhere, it starts to pour. People went wild, screaming and embracing the elements and... And then Jerry... I'll never forget it. I saw Jerry. He was looking over at me with this twinkle in his eye. He didn't say anything. It was just this... Jerry look. Before I know it, he launches into Cold Rain and Snow. People went crazy! Their faces were covered with this mystical alchemy of tears and rain. And then they go into Box of Rain, and then they segue into Looks Like Rain. I swear, I could have taken Bobby right then and there. Oh, my goodness. - Well, I-I think I'm gonna go read upstairs. - Yeah, I'm kind of tired. - Oh, honey! - But it's your last evening. Don't go. It's--it's early. Oh. Have you ever seen a grow room? - Whoa. Mom would freak if she saw this. - Yeah, well, that's why we're gonna practice discretion, right? - Can you smoke it like this? - Oh, my God. You're an idiot. - No, you--you-- No, you let it dry, until it looks like this. - If I think my mouth's wet, then why am I so thirsty? - I've--I got some more French fries in the freezer. - French fries in the freezer. - The Grateful Dead... Joan Baez... Anything reggae. You're not serious. - Oh, I'm absolutely serious. - You don't listen to any of them. - The soundtrack of my youth. - You know what I think? I think you need new ears to listen to old music. All right, um... # I pulled into Nazareth # # I was feeling about half past dead # # I just need a place # # Where I can lay my head # You don't know the words? - Oh, I know the words. - This is beautiful. - Yes, it is beautiful. - It's so beautiful. - Beautiful. - Good night! - Oh, my God. It's your mother. - Hide the food! - No, hide the weed, you idiot. - It's raining. - My little peacocks are safe. - Mom would have lost it. That is so stoned. - The important thing is to be intelligent about it. You know, it's okay to toke a little hay from time to time. You stay away from the brown stuff. That's what took down Janis and Jimi. Nothing with needles. Nothing up the nose. Jake, you hear me? - Yeah. - Oh, oh, I suppose my little chicks are getting ready to fly the coop. I thought we were peacocks. - Mom, how would you feel about us staying a couple of days? - Yay, yay! - Would that be all right? - Well, what about your job at Fascist, Fascist, and Fascist? - Fascists vacation too. - Mom, I'm cool to stay. - Good. - You can't just usurp our lives like this. I have stuff to do at home. - Oh, it's just for a week. Calm down. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. Did the patron saint of uptight just tell me to calm down? - Mom, where are you going? - I'm going into town to print some documents. - Can I get a ride? - Where? - The coffee shop. - Sure. - Never gonna happen. - Yo, yo! You're gonna need this, huh? Go. Hi. - Hello. Want a bite? - No, thank you. - May I? - Yeah. - "I asked love this morning where it hides, "and it said, 'Open your hands and open your eyes."' Scribble, scribble, scribble, scribble. Looks like you're suffering from the ancient pain of halted tongue. - Well, if you mean "writer's block," then yeah. - Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Open your hands. Ask the goddess to bring you-- - I'm sorry. I can't do that. - Every good writer knows that the root of inspiration is spirit. You need a muse. Perhaps our lovely Cole, hmm? - Oh, no. He's too barbaric to be a muse. - Oh, well, we must not be talking about the same man then, because the Cole I know is kind and loyal and community-minded. You have to be able to look deep into a man to know the nature of his heart. And to look deep, you-- you have to have love. And you, my precious nightingale, if you are not open to the possibility of love, then you can never truly be a poet of it. - Woodstock specialty: salted hot chocolate. So how's your movie going? - It's still coming together. - What's it about again? - I'm not sure yet. I'm kind of letting the film come to me. - Sounds avant-garde. - Yeah, it probably is. Avant-garde. - Hey, there's a music festival this weekend. You should totally film it, and I could help you out if you wanted. - What about your...boyfriend? Will he be cool with it? - Um, my boyfriend? - Yeah, um, at the party, I saw you with a guy. - Oh, you mean Pete. God, no way. We're-- We're totally just friends. - Sweet! I mean, yeah. In that case, I could-- I could definitely film it. I could do some serious filming. - Cool. So what do you think? - Pretty salty. - Said the nun to the sailor. # How happy that would be # - What I'm saying is, it's good to keep the lights on, especially if you're flying a little high. - Why the lights? - Check for crabs, gonorrhea. - Dude, ugh... - Hey, VD is no laughing matter. Let's see... - Why do you have so much men's clothing? - I did wardrobe for an improv group in the '80s. Do you carry a condom? - A condom? Uh, no. I don't need protection. - Well, that's where you're wrong. - I mean, me and girls, we just don't... Like, girls and I, we don't... - Oh, okay. I thought you were hot for Tara. You need protection for boys too. - What? Wha--no! No, no, no, no. I mean--I mean, girls don't want to... With me, not that I don't want to... With girls. - Oh, it's called "making love." Call it by its name. It's a beautiful thing. - Making love. - That's right. And you have your whole life ahead of you to find out about it. You know you're gorgeous. - I'm kind of a geek. - Oh, that's just a state of mind. You need transformation and color. Look at this. Color is the key to transformation. Yeah. - Fresh-squeezed lemonade, $2! Fresh-squeezed lemonade! - Veggie burritos! Tofu dogs and veggie burritos... - It's so hot outside. # Turn back your heart # # To the day # # That we met # # My love's not through # # With you yet # - Cosmic forces inside of you... - Yeah, yeah, man. - Mom, can I go take a walk? - If you stay where I can see you, you may. - What? # Seems like yesterday # # When we took this track # - Hey. I thought you were leaving today. - I was, but Zoe and Jake wanted to stay. - I'm glad you made it. Are you enjoying the music? - I'm tolerating it. Well, that's a start. I'll see you around? - Sure. - Yeah? Good. - "Zoe and Jake wanted to stay"? - Oh. # The day that we met # # My love's not through # # With you yet # # Oh, don't forget # # Oh, don't forget # # Oh, don't forget # - Hi! - Hey. - Why are you dressed like that? - My grandma said every peacock has to flaunt its feathers. - Ah. My grandma hates the way I dress. She lives in Ohio. - That sucks. - So... Do you like birds? - Yeah. Yeah, they're all right. # My love's not through # # With you yet # - Oh, come on, don't act like that. - Like what? - Like I killed your puppy. # My love's not through # # With you yet # # Oh, don't forget # Thank you! - Whoa! - Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you! Whoo! Oh, this is so totally awesome! Look at you! All these beautiful people in this-- in this beautiful place. Oh, my Lord. - You're beautiful! - So are you, baby. So now to open our second set, I want to introduce you to one of the most favorite men I ever knew: Jude Fisher! Whoo! - Hey, Grace. Mwah. Hey, everybody! How about this day? All right, listen, I met somebody the other day who I think is, um, exceedingly special, and if you'd all indulge me, I'd really like to bring her up onstage to help kick off the first song. Diane. Come on up here. All right, now, Diane seems a wee bit shy, so maybe we can show her a little love and give her a little support? - Come on! - Holy shit. - Whoo! Go, girl! Whoo! - There we go! I'm gonna kill you. - Hey. I know you are. # I pulled into Nazareth # # I was feeling about half past dead # # I just need some place # # Where I can lay my head # # Hey, mister, can you tell me # # Where a man might find a bed? # # He just grinned and shook my hand # # And no was all he said # # Take a load off, Annie # # Take a load for free # # Take a load off, Annie # - # And... # - # And... # # Put your load right on me # - Whoo! - Yeah! both: # I picked up my bag # # Went looking for a place to hide # # When I saw Carmen and the devil # # Walking side-by-side # # I said, Hey, Carmen # # Come on, let's go downtown # # She said, I got to go # # But my friend can stick around # # Take a load off, Annie # # Take a load for free # # Take a load off, Annie # - # And... # - # And... # # You can put your load right on me # - Oh! both: # Take a load off, Annie # # Take a load for free # # Take a load off, Annie # - # And... # - # And... # both: # You put your load right on me # Hey! - Hey. - Whoo! Whoo! - Let's hear it for Diane! - Whoo! - You okay? - Um, my mom just made out with a stranger in public, and she's not even divorced yet. Sorry. - What are you apologizing for? - I don't know. I should be too modern or whatever to care about something as banal as divorce is, but I feel really bad about it, and she doesn't acknowledge it. She just expects me to hop on board, and that really pisses me off. - It can't be easy for her. - I know this is gonna sound immature, but it'd be really helpful if you didn't take her side right now. God. I so don't want to be here. - Mom! - Oh, honey. - Have you seen Zoe and Jake? - Oh, they're young. They're fine. There he is. There's Jake. We'll--we'll look around for Zoe. - No, I'm not leaving here without her. - Oh, honey, honey, honey. Go home, run a salt bath, light some candles. Lavender has a calming effect. - I don't want to be calm! - Of course you do! - Yeah? - Uh, Jake's in his room, and Zoe called and said she'll be home a little bit later. - They hate me. - It's difficult for kids to-- to accept that their parents are human. Prone to imperfections like everyone else. You were miraculous today, by the way. - You should see this place in the fall. - "The wild gander leads his flock through the..." both: "Cool night. Ya-honk!" - I can't believe you have Whitman memorized. - Why is that? - Well, you don't really seem like the poetic type. You're kind of a snob, you know that? No, not really. But... Oh, yeah, I guess so. Sorry. - Well, Whitman happens to be my favorite. - I love the part when the child asks what a-- a blade of grass is. - And he calls it the beautiful uncut hair of graves. - You're a surprising human being, you know that? - You're kind of surprising yourself. - Zoe. What happened today was-- - Yeah, I don't want to talk about it. - I know--I just want you to know that it wasn't-- - But that you're still married. Yeah. - Your dad asked me for the divorce, not the other way around. - Can you blame him? Hello. Oh, my God! I, um... I am so sorry. - Perhaps you haven't seen a penis before after all. Would you give us just a minute? - Zoe, this is Jazz. Hi. - Hey. - There's a beer up at the house if you want to grab one. - Sounds good. - Come here. I want to show you something. It's okay. Relax. I've been working on this for months. It keeps evading me. See, I started off, and I wanted to create a heart, but I couldn't get the two sides to balance. So I cut the clay in half, and I made that, that teardrop. But I couldn't figure out what to do with the other half of the clay. Then your mother showed up with your brother and you, and I realized the other half of the heart was supposed to be the wing of a bird, open for flight. See, sometimes... Sometimes in art, like in life, you have to accept the fact that your-- things aren't going right, and you don't quite know where you're going, and you have to accept that because that's when transformation can happen. You know, I heard what you said to your mother last night. - Ooh. Well, l--I was upset. - Yeah. You were also cruel, but you will transform that as well. - Hi. - Hi. - Beautiful home. - Thank you very much. - Wow. - My workshop. - Do people actually sit in those? - They do. You want to try it? No. - Oh, come on. Where's your spirit of adventure? - I think I exhausted it yesterday. - Oh, here I was hoping you were just getting started. - I don't know what I'm doing here. I don't even know you. - What do you want to know? Ow. Oh! - Just a little bit. Perfect. - Okay. - Don't look directly into the lens, just... Right. - Look at you. - Ready. Look at me. - At you? - Look at me. - Okay. Good? - When did you decide to become a butcher? - I worked on my father's farm as a kid, and he taught me the basics, and Mr. Fleisher gave me the job in high school, and I came back to work for him after college. - Why did you come back? - Well, my dad, he lost his farm. - Market's getting harder for the family farm. - It wasn't that. He, uh--he was a good businessman, yeah. - Then what was it? - Well, he refused to plant GMOs. Right, they're genetically modified organisms or seeds, and the farm next to him, well, they did, and basically, their seeds blew over into his crop. So next thing you know, he's sinking thousands of dollars into litigation because these men-- these corporations, they own the rights to these seeds;, they're taking him to court. I mean, it makes no sense. You wouldn't believe the shit they pulled. Anyway, now I just want to be a part of a business that saves farms like his. - That's quite a lengthy response. It's gonna take some-- some editing. Um, I'm gonna play something for you, and I'd like you to respond. Why did you get so mad at Cole the butcher? - The answer's in the question. - What does that mean? - It means, he butchers animals for a living. So I have no patience for people who have no compassion for anything outside of themselves. - Do you have a response? - You still feel that way? All right, well, I'm gonna get back to work. - I'm sorry, okay? - You had no right. - I didn't think he'd react that way. I just thought that the conflict would be interesting. - You know what, Jake? Conflict isn't interesting. But you had no right to use that for your video. - Film. - No, video. Real filmmakers don't need cheap stunts to make good films. - Zoe, I messed up, okay? People mess up. You mess up. Remember that time your Barbies tried my soldiers for crimes against humanity, and then you had them all decapitated? - This is different, Jake. This involves real people. - Hey, you thirsty? - Yes. - I don't understand your relationship with her. - Who? Your mom? - Yes, my mom. - Well, Grace is a little intense, but her heart's in the right place, you know? You're not around. Neither are the kids. She's alone. - Thank you. - She's got no other family. - Yeah, what about her minions of lovers? - Ah, I think they just distract her from the fact that she feels very much like she's by herself. - You think that's my fault? - No, I don't. I think it runs much deeper than her relationship with any one person. - My mom gave me this. It was my grandmother's. Go. Good. - Well, I never thought I'd see the day when you're doing farmwork. - This isn't a farm. It's your weird backyard. Uh, oh, God. That's disgusting. - Why? It's--it's chicken poop. It makes the best fertilizer. And... Speaking of fertilization, guess what tonight is. Full moon! - Oh, no, no. - Zoe's really excited about it. - No, absolutely not, no. - Oh, it is a sacred ritual. - No, she has to take Jake on his date with Tara. She has to chaperone him. Uh-uh. - Diana, honey. Don't be a cock-block, okay? He creates enough obstacles on his own. - Mom, could you please not say "cock-block"? Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna-na-na. Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna-na-na. Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna. Luna, Luna, Luna-na-na, Luna-na-na. Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna. Luna, Luna, Luna-na-na, Luna. Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna. Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna. - You're missing all the fun. - I know what I'm missing. - Luminous beauty guides us. You pull the tides and sing lullabies to the fields. Oh, incandescent orb of loveliness! You are woman! - Look, I'm sorry for what I said last night. - You're not still mad at me? - No, you're, um... Are a bird now or a wing. I don't really know what that means, but I think it has something to do with you making a new life and me getting over it. Well, you coming? - No. - It would mean a lot to Grace. - When l-- when I met the Dalai Lama... Gorgeous man, by the way. - Uh-huh. - He told me the artist must look with the heart. - Ahh. - Ah, Diana, your sisters welcome you. - Hi! - Welcome! Join us! - Who wants to play a game? - Huh? - Always. - Truth or lies. Here are the rules. Someone tells a story, and then everyone says if they think it's true or false. - And if you're wrong? - Then you take a shot of tequila. - Ah! - And the winner gets her stomach pumped? - You do what feels right for you. - Don't be a lightweight. - Like, people in general are too hard on each other. Everyone's trying their best, you know? There's enough violence in this world without us fighting all the time. And that's-- - Cut. This lighting just really isn't working for me. - We can stop. It's fine. - These damn technical malfunctions. - We can try it another time. - Okay. So you want me to leave? - Why would I want you to leave? - So... What do you want to do? - I was all prepared to be interviewed. So I guess you're gonna have to figure something out... Or we could listen to music. - Sweet, yeah. Let's put on some tunes. - Yeah. - There I was, naked as a jaybird, just a wreath of flowers in my hair. I walk in. I say, "Excuse me. I didn't know this was the men's room." - True. - True. - False! False! - No, it's true. - Lie. - What? - Oh, I'm right then. - I was not wearing any flowers. - Then take a little shot. - We haven't heard from Diana. - Oh, yeah. - No. - Oh, come on. - No, no, no, no, no. I don't think I'd be very good at this game. - Oh, come on! Everybody plays. - Uh, okay. I was--I was, ah-- accidentally, when I was in college, I found myself at a gay bar, and I danced with a woman. - Oh! True. - And... - True? - False. - Okay, there was no dancing... And I've never been to a gay bar. - Oh, what have we here? - That's for me. - No masculine energies allowed. This is the night of the moon. - So is this what happens when guys aren't around? - I thought you were mad at me. - Well, after I got done crying my eyes out, I guess you're all right. - Come on. # And I'm waiting for the day # - What does her voice sound like to you? - I don't know. Like she's singing? # I know you have the heart # - No, I mean, what does it sound like? # And I'm hoping that... # - Like icicles. Like-- - Yes, yes, like crushed flowers or like hard candy. - Like old sweaters. - Yeah. - Or... # But it turns out just the same # # And you break a lot of things # - I had a threesome with Leonard Cohen. - Duh. - Who didn't? - True. - Duh. - Yeah, it's true. - He's such a sexy beast. - Easy! - I have another one. - No! No! No, you're cut off, Grace. Mother. Really, no, I can't... Honestly, I can't, but-- Mmm. Oh, my gosh. We're out of tequila. - I'll go get a new bottle. - Oh, thanks, Mom. No. - Yes, I will be right back. - Okay. - I really am sorry for earlier. - Don't even think about it. - Wouldn't you rather smoke a joint? You know, it's less likely to kill you. - Yeah, I don't smoke... That, I mean. Impossible. - No joke. - Wait, isn't it, like, required to be a citizen of Woodstock? - Yeah. That's why I can't vote in local elections. - No, seriously. Why cigarettes but not pot? - I like reality... As it is. - Okay, so I've got one. - Oh, no. - Wait, no, I do. I have one. - Shh. - No, I do. I do, okay. Three days ago, I swam with a man who was naked in a lake. - Lie! - False. - No, it's true. It's true. I slept with him today. - Who was it? - Oh, my God. - Jude Fisher. - That is so beautiful and open-minded. Two women sharing love with the same man. - What do you-- what do you mean "share"? What does she mean, "sharing love"? # No one says a word to me # # They're concerned with my jealousy # # Well, I guess that's how it's got to be # # From now on # Shit! # Time, it swallows everything # - It--it's still moving. We should-- - I'll handle it. - No way. Cole... - She's suffering. - We can take him to a vet. You don't need-- - Just close your eyes and turn your head. Zoe, just do it. - Cole! Cole! # What's been going on # - My lips are getting chapped. - Is it my stubble? - I don't think so. - Tara, honey, it's almost midnight. Does your friend need a ride home? # What's been going on # # Around here # # There goes her old beat-up car # # Outside of our old favorite bar # # She's probably in there playing her guitar # # Get on my feet again # # What do I do to live # - Why didn't you tell me? Are you still sleeping with my mother? - No. Diane, it was a long time ago. I was a mess. She had just lost her mother. - Oh, so you rescued her. You're a hero. - You don't have to go. You're--you're overreacting. - I'm overreacting? You set me up with a guy you slept with. - He's perfect for you. - You slept with him! - Why does the past mean so much to you? - This coming from a woman who still thinks it's 1 969. Zoe, Jake! We're leaving! - Your grandmother had just died. Reed left me. I mean, it was only a few months. - I'm gonna be sick. - Oh, don't be so melodramatic. - Mom, I can't even look at him. - God, I didn't think it was-- - That's right. You didn't think. You never think. You don't think. You didn't think about what's appropriate to expose my children to or what's appropriate behavior at your own daughter's wedding. - Well, hey, hey, hey! You had your alcohol. Why shouldn't I have my grass? - You sold pot to my friends at my reception, Mother. - Well, some people like a safer form of inebriation, and you had me arrested for it. - Well, somebody had to draw boundaries. God knows you never did. - You--you didn't draw boundaries. You had me cut out of your life. And for what? Because I was selling grass to your wedding guests? - No, for all of it. For all of it. For all the nights I sat upstairs in my room listening to you laugh in bed with men who weren't my father! - What was I supposed to be? A nun? - And, Mom, I can't even count the times you didn't pick me up from school because you were so self-absorbed with your art. You'd think after 20 years, some things would have changed, but... Let's go. Jake, get in. # Oh, to take sorrow # # And use it as a crutch # # And have all you need # # And never know it as such # # Oh, to want the warmth of fire # # And get the burn of its touch # # I think about you way too much # # The devil's got my secret # # He swore he'd never tell # # I left it for safekeeping # # I'll pick it up in hell # # A match is struck only once # # The thought's struck more than twice # # Honesty's a virtue that is wavering like a vice # # Yeah, it screams in two directions # # Yeah, it cuts like a knife # # I'll think about you all my life # # The devil's got my secret # # He swore he'd never tell # # I left it for safekeeping # # I'll pick it up in hell # # I will pick it up in hell # # Should I choose the one way # # My life goes on # # My world's not broken # # My home's not gone # # Oh, but should I choose the other # # So sweet and wrong # # No, I'll think about you and continue on # # No, the devil's got my secret # # He swore he'd never tell # # I left it for safekeeping # # I'll pick it up in hell # - Do you have any, uh... Do you have any letters for Hudson? - There you go. - Thanks. Hello, ladies. - What's with the monkey suit? - It's my trademark. - A trademark for what? - It's gonna be what I wear to all the film awards I'm gonna win, starting with this year's New York Youth Film Festival. - You got into a festival? - Yep. - You made a movie? - No, I made a film. - Well, what's--what's it about? - Zoe, that's the wrong question to be asking. What is any film really about? - Tara's mom said she could come to-- - You're still dating? - Yeah! She has a weakness for artist types. - You're not exactly Picasso. - No, you're right. I'm more like... - Don't even say Herzog. - Werner Herzog. - Who? - It doesn't matter. - Diane Hudson. Mom? Where are you? - Try and be careful next time. Nobody's gonna believe that an ounce and a half is for personal use. - Yeah. - Okay? - Thanks. - Don't. - What, I can't thank you for helping me out? - You are unbelievable. You said you weren't dealing anymore. - I told you what you needed to hear. - Oh, so now you're playing the protective parent? Interesting. - You made your case, counselor. I know I made mistakes as a mother. I--I don't have any defense. - Hmm. - Maybe I would have been a terrible grandmother too. Would have sure been nice, though, to find out. - Oh, please. - Maybe 20 years of banishment is enough. I mean, isn't there a-- what do you call it? Statue of limitations? You're a mother now. What crime could you commit that would be worthy of the punishment of not seeing Jake and Zoe for 20 years? - I want to know how she managed to get two phone calls. - She's a resourceful woman. I'll give her that. - I wanted to apologize for what happened. - Oh, God, please don't. Please. I should have just left her there. I promised myself I would never enable her again. And here I am-- I'm bailing her out of jail, and I end up feeling like the bad guy. I mean, what I should have said to her was absolutely-- - You spend more energy fighting than anyone I've ever known. - What? - You fight all the time. I mean, you said it yourself. A good lawyer has to keep her fists up. - Great, thanks. - This is exactly what I mean, Diane. You're so busy fighting everyone that you don't realize most of the time, they're--they're not fighting you back. You're boxing shadows, and the people that love you the most, they can't get near you. - That is not true. - Let me ask you something. Have you ever considered letting it go? - Letting what go? Hmm? - The fight. - Oh, you want me to just let go of 40 years of irresponsibility, embarrassment, and her total refusal to grow up? - Yes, exactly. - Like a balloon that'll just float away. - It's not a balloon, Diane. It's a sandbag you've got to drop for the balloon to get off the ground. - That was Denise McDonough. Wow. What a great effort, huh? A wonderful combination of live action and digital animation. Thanks so much, Denise. - Hello, Grace. Very nice to see you. - And it's a first effort by... - Always such dignity and restraint. - Mr. Jake Hudson. - Well, my dad, he lost his farm. He refused to plant GMOs. Right, they're genetically modified organisms. - Violence is the antithesis of freedom. You're still killing a helpless animal. - First of all, I don't actually kill the cows. - Oh, that's right. You merely dismember them. - Have you seen a cow? I'm sure I'd lose in hand-to-hand combat. - Jake, if you don't shut off that camera, I'm gonna beat you with it-- now! - Do you feel responsible for their failed marriage? Are you gonna have daddy issues now? - Spielberg, knock it off! - Peace! Now! - "It is without name. "It is a word unsaid. "It is not in any dictionary, "utterance, symbol. " - It's not like we're at war with each other. I mean, there's enough violence in this world without us fighting all the time. That's violence too, even if it looks different. - What are you doing with that camera, anyway? - I'm making a documentary. - About? - Well, what is any film really about, you know? Uh, but mostly about love. - "I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own, "and I know that the spirit of God "is the brother of my own "and that all the men ever born are also my brothers "and the women my sisters and lovers and that a keelson of the creation is love. " "It may be if I had known them, "I would have loved them. "It may be you are from old people "or from offspring "taken soon out of their mothers' laps. And here you are, the mothers' laps. " - Are you making a movie? - "It is not chaos or death. " Why humans? "It is form, union, plan. "It is eternal life. It is happiness. " - Ahh! Whoo! Good, good. - Great job, Jake. - Thanks. - You are a very talented filmmaker. Keep up the good work. - Grandma. - Totally inspired. Look at this. - Wasn't it beautiful? - Oh. - Very poetic. I had no idea your vacation was so eventful. - Well, I got to go. I can't leave the chickens alone too long. Inspired. - Bye, Grandma. - See you next weekend. - All right. - Good job, kiddo. - Thanks for coming, Dad. - I got you a little present. - Is this a joke? - Yeah, kind of. - Funny. You know, not to be rude, but why are you here? - Well, I'm not gonna miss my big screen debut. I mean, that'd be silly. - Do you, uh, think I'm violent with you? Closed off? Defensive? - Sometimes. - But you're here. - Yeah, I am. I am here. - And I judge you for what you do. - That's not my problem. - It kind of is. - No, no, actually, it's-- that's your problem. - Thank you. Thank you. - Have you talked to Cole? - Um, well, I always had this idea of the kind of guy I wanted to be with, and he'd be educated and cultured. A vegetarian. - Basically, a boy version of you. Yeah, I--I guess so. And, you know, I do wish Cole didn't dismember animals for a living. - I know. - But I also understand that he does it in a way that to him seems ethical. - You gonna tell him that? - Meyer says he got it for $5.21 a pound. - Sir, prices vary week to week. I'm sorry. - All I want is a fair shake. - Hey. Please say something. - The client doesn't stipulate additional employee rights. If we go to trial, we lose. I'll be there in 30 minutes. - Hey, Jake's not helping. - I'm documenting this for our ancestors. - You mean descendants. - Get over here and carry a box. - You wouldn't do this to Werner Herzog. - Oh, wait a minute. Not in my house. - All right, we'll stick him next to The Cannabis Grows Bible. Maybe he'll learn something. - Mom, I'm starving. - Oh, I made some brownies. - Don't even think about it. - Say hi to little Yellow. - The men are doing all the heavy lifting. Seems a little sexist to me. How about you, Zoe? - It's not about equal division of labor. It's about an equitable and efficient allocation of resources. - Right on! Good. # Peace # # Love # # Understanding # # Yeah # # Peace and love # # And understanding # # Peace and love # # And understanding # - She does have a soft spot for musicians.
