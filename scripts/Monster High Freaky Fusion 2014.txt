When we get back to the others, can we skip telling them that last part? (LAUGHS) My hero. (GROWLING) Whoa! Hey, look over here! Look over here! Whoa! Whoa! Look at this! Sirena! Be careful! Avia! Bonita! - Looks like you two could use a lift. - Hang on, Frankie! FRANKIE: Okay, okay, I know what you're thinking. Who's that voltageously cute zombie-unicorn guy, and could he be any more adorbs? (GIGGLES) That or you're wondering about the big scary creature. Either way, I'll bet I've sparked your attention. This is a story about family. There are lots of different types of families. And they can sometimes be found in pretty unexpected places. But, hey, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's tell the story from the beginning. Oh, right! The opening titles! We are monsters We are proud We are monsters Say it loud Don't stop rocking your right to fright We are Monster High We are monsters We are proud We are monsters, say it loud We are Monster High We are monsters We are proud We are monsters, say it loud We are Monster High FRANKIE: It all started on the 200th anniversary of the opening of Monster High, the bite-centennial celebration. It was a really big deal. Ugh, I guess this bite-centennial celebration is a really big deal. (SNIFFING) Ugh! You ghouls smell that? It's like cheap cologne. - Ahem. - (CHUCKLES) Did I say cheap? I meant cheerfully applied by our favorite invisible drama teacher, who loves giving us A's? Smooth, Clawdeen. Very smooth. Are we ready for this evening's scaritage performance, ladies? Ready? Why, we're practically bursting at the seams. I know how you feel. The whole school is howling with anticipation for the info-tainment event of the century, "The History of Monster High. "A Bite-centennial Celebration of Exceptional Acceptance." A Mr. Where production. Trademark pending. Do not be late for the rehearsal this afternoon. ALL: We won't. (EXHALES) Okay, seriously? That cologne smells worse than a zombie's gym bag. - Huh? - No offense, Ghoulia. (GROANS) (GASPS) What's with the new kids? You ghouls haven't met the new transfer students yet? They're Hybrid Monsters. You mean they're like two different monsters in one? Exactly. They each have more than one scaritage. Two different monsters? Shouldn't they have to make up their minds? Cleo, you can't even make up your mind when you pick an outfit for school. (GASPS) You know, I've heard this isn't the first time they've changed schools. I guess being a Hybrid makes it hard to fit in. They don't look very friendly. Cleo, you don't look very friendly. (GHOULS GIGGLING) (GRUNTS) Oh, my ghoul, Frankie! - Embarrassing. - NEIGHTHAN: Hey. Are you okay? Yeah, I don't know what happened. I just... (GASPS) I'm Frankie. And now would be the part where you tell me your name. (STUTTERING) I'm... Neighthan. His name is Neighthan. Come on, Neighthan, let's go. Oh, welcome to Monster High, Neighthan. I think you and your Hybrid friends are really going to like it here. Yeah. Sure. Come on, Neighthan. Time to go. Told you they didn't seem very friendly. I gotta go. Bye, Frankie. (GRUNTS) (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Sign. Bye. (SIGHING) ...which finally brings us to the most important branch of the de Nile family tree. Next slide. Me! So, in conclusion, because my family has more pharaohs and queens than anyone else's, my scaritage project should win first prize. The scaritage report is an assignment. Not a competition. Well, just so long as we're all in agreement that if this were a competition, I'd win. (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) Robecca Steam, your turn. This is my father, - Hexiciah Steam. - (ALL MURMURING) He was a brilliant mechanic, a revolutionary inventor, and a teacher here at Monster High. I was well acquainted with Professor Steam. - Here we go again. - (ALL GROANING) I was his favorite student. And who could blame him? My father had a workshop down in the catacombs where they say he invented something new every single day. And one day, he invented me. Favorite student. Right here. And this belongs to my father. I don't really know what it is. Father went missing over 100 years ago, so I've kept this to remember him by. Every time I look at it, it reminds me how grateful I am that Hexiciah Steam discovered the secret to creating life, to creating me. (APPLAUSE) Very good, Robecca. And now, Frankie Stein. (CLEARS THROAT) Me? Okay. Um... (CLEARS THROAT) So, um, my grandfather was Victor Frankenstein, and he built my dad, and... That's all I know. Thank you. That's it? I think Grandpa went to Monster High. Oh! Oh... And I have these. The blueprints for making me. And the photo album? Oh, um... Just a bunch of ripped out pages. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) And that's all I got. Frankie Stein, I am most disappointed with this report. You are completely unprepared. But my mom and dad won't tell me about my... When I was a student here at Monster High, I was always prepared. It's like Professor Steam used to say, "If you're always prepared..." ALL: "You'll never be scared." Correct. Frankie Stein, you are to redo the assignment and present it again first thing tomorrow. (SOBBING) Next, Abbey Bominable. Family history starts with ice age. Fasten seat belts. This could take a while. Could somebody pass the Dead Sea salt? - I've got it. - Here you go. - After you. - Sorry about that. - If you insist. - All right then. - Oh, no, my fault. - Sorry about that. Oh, for dying out loud. Don't fret, love. A bad grade on your project isn't the end of the world. No, it's not that, Lagoona. It's just, you ghouls all seem to know so much about your scaritage. But I don't know anything about mine. Can you not speak to your father about your family? My parents won't talk about my grandfather. And anytime I ask, my dad just gets into one of his moods and is all... (GROWLS) "Grandpa bad!" (ALL LAUGHING) (SHIVERS) Ooh. Oh. Too cold. Allow me. Much better. Hey, guys! Wanna join us? Yeah, that would be... Unnecessary, because we've already got a table. Thanks. Rude much? No wonder they got kicked out of eight different schools. You know, I wish there was some way we could find my father's workshop in the catacombs. He used to keep a journal about everything. If your grandfather was a student at Monster High, I'm sure he'd have written about him. You don't remember where it is? If I really fire on all cylinders, I think I might be able to find it. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go find that journal. Uh, Venus, you know I don't do salad. Meow. What's this I hear about a mystery trip to the catacombs? I'm so there. Scooch. (SCOFFS) Um... Hello, this is my space. And why would you want to come with us to the catacombs, Toralei? What? I'm a curious kitty. Now let's go find that... Whatever it is we're finding. (GRUNTS) All right, loverghoul, let's go. I don't know why we couldn't sit with them. Those ghouls seemed nice. Neighthan, don't be naive. Regular monsters don't want anything to do with us Hybrids. You know how it works. We change schools, get pushed around for a few weeks, then it's off to find another school. This place will be no different. Come on, Avia. Monster High is supposed to be different than those other schools. They say everyone is welcome. Even if they have a freaky flaw. Yeah, flaw, not flaws. They don't understand what it's like to have two. Right, Sirena? Sirena! Huh? Oh. Yes. I agree with all of you. You got distracted again. No, I just... Oh, hey... Are you going to finish those? (LAUGHING) (RUMBLING) (BOTH GASP) - Please, after you. - You first. - If you insist. - Why, thank you. (BOTH GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) - Toralei, move over! - I like this spot! Move over! - Scooch. - Move over. - Move! - (HISSES) Brace yourself, it's a bumpy ride. (ALL SCREAMING) (ELEVATOR DINGS) I'm pretty sure it was down... (STUTTERING) This way. It's so dark down here. Can anybody see anything? I've got this. No, worries. I've got this. Looks like we have a hidden passage down under. This is it. Ghouls, I give you the workshop of Hexiciah Steam! (METAL CREAKING) I didn't expect it to be so bottomless-pitty. (CHUCKLES) I don't understand. It should be right here. (ALL EXCLAIMING) All those in favor of not opening the scary clock door again, say eyeball. ALL: Eyeball! (GASPING) VENUS: I don't get it. It's just a model. (GASPING) VENUS: It's about time? She's right. It's about time we got out of here. (GROANS) - (ALL GASPING) - FRANKIE: Wow! It's about time! A security lock based on a clock system. Oh, that is so my dad. (ALL GASPING) (CUCKOOS) (SNEEZES) Okay, everybody spread out and look for that journal. Uh, but remember, don't touch anything. Why's everyone looking at me? Okay! Don't touch anything, got it! (GASPS) Oh, my Ra! Why didn't anybody tell me my headband was crooked? Hey, what you doing? Toralei! (ENUNCIATING) Meow. Ghouls, I found the journal! Does it say anything about my grandfather? "October 5th, 1814. "Victor Frankenstein is one of the brightest and most promising students" "I have ever had the pleasure to educate." That's him! You found my grandfather! - What else does it say? - Let's see. Hmm. "Unfortunately, there's another side to Victor. "A dangerous inner personality "that recklessly disregards the spectacular mysteries of life "in pursuit of his scientific ambitions. "I fear this may be young Victor's undoing." Wow... I wonder if that's why my parents don't talk about him. (MEOWS) Hey! I wasn't done with that. Uh... That's different. - ALL: Toralei! - Okay. Now I get why you all looked at me when you said, "Don't touch anything." Uh-oh! (GASPS) (EXCLAIMING) (YOWLING) Whoa... (ALL EXCLAIMING) (ALL SCREAMING) (CUCKOOS) Oh. Somebody wanna tell me what just happened? Ugh, I'll tell you what happened. Toralei touched something. Mmm. Something's different. Does this workshop look (GROANS) cleaner to you ghouls? VENUS: Draculaura's right. Something is different. Isn't it obvious? Robecca's dad invented some kind of a cleaner-upper machine. You ghouls should be thanking me for sprucing up this dump. Whatever that was, I feel it would be wise for us to leave before something else happens. Jinafire's right. We should get back up to the school or we're gonna miss Mr. Where's rehearsal. (ALL EXCLAIMING) (GASPING) (ALL GASPING) (GASPS) Oh... FRANKIE: It looks like Monster High is under construction. DRACULAURA: 1814? So that means Hexiciah Steam built a... Time teleporter. CLAWDEEN: No way! FRANKIE: If this is the year 1814, then that means - I can go meet my grandfather! - (GROANS) I agree. We cannot risk interactions with past events. Our presence here could change the entire course of monster history. Oh. I guess you're right. Ghoulia, how long until we can open the workshop door again? - (GROANS) - Then it's settled. We wait one hour for the workshop door to reopen and we go back to... Where's Toralei? Oh, no. Look. (MEOWS) (LAUGHS) That kitty really rankles my bandages. We've got to find her before she causes any more trouble. (WHIMPERING) This is so bad! Don't worry, Draculaura. We'll find Toralei. DRACULAURA: Not that. There's no iCoffin reception in 1814. (BAWLING) Why is everybody staring at us? CLAWDEEN: It's 1814. They've never seen fashion styles like ours before. (GRUNTS) It's a Ghost-ier original and it's magnificent. Move along. The sooner we find Toralei and get back to our own time, the better. We should split up. We'll find her faster that way. And remember, try not to talk to anybody. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (CHUCKLES) Toralei has got to be around here somewhere. (GASPING) All right, class. Settle down. Settle down. That's Hexiciah Steam. Robecca's dad. (PANTING) Sorry, I'm late again, Professor Steam! Oh, my ghoul! That's... Mr. Rotter! Just take your seat. Come on. Let's just stay for a bit. (SIGHS) I trust you're prepared to deliver your scaritage report? I am not, sir. A little preparation would go along way toward succeeding in my class, Mr. Rotter. You see, if you're always prepared... You'll never be scared! (CHUCKLES) Yes. Yes, indeed! Very good. I like that. (LAUGHS) (SIGHS) I can't believe Robecca is missing this. I wish I could text her. Now then, since Mr. Rotter is not prepared, would somebody else care to share something about their scaritage? (SPARKY LAUGHS) No fear. I've got this. All right then, Sparky, you're next. Hey, check out mad scientist boy. Class, Professor Steam, I do not have a scaritage. - For, you see, I am an orphan. - (SIGHS) So because I don't have a family, I made one! (GROWLING) Yes! I have created life! (THUNDER RUMBLING) Feast your eyes upon Ancestral-bot 3.5 and 3.7. Eh... Don't ask about 3.6. He turned out to be a few electrons short of a carbon molecule, if you know what I mean. (CHUCKLES) (DISTORTED GROWLING) (ALL LAUGHING) Not to worry. Just a little setback. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Maybe the normie student exchange program wasn't such a good idea. Think we can send him back? (SIGHS) (STUTTERING) Stop laughing at me! I can get it right. I know it. I'm just missing something! Some part. Some ingredient! You're right. You are missing something. You tried to create life using this. But you left out this. Uh, you mean guts and organs and stuff? No, I used plenty of those. Look. (CHUCKLES) No, no, no. What I'm talking about isn't a physical part, lad. Not some tangible ingredient. Creating life requires something more. Something of one's self. A spark. Ah... No, you lost me. Hmm. There are two sides to every single one of us. There's this physical nonsense of skin and bones. And in some cases, copper and steam whistles. (WHISTLES) But there's also something deep down that we can't see or touch. Maybe it's emotion. Maybe it's love. I don't really know. But what I do know is that you cannot simply brute force the science to cater to your every whim. If you're not careful, the consequences could be catastrophic. But it is possible. Somebody made me. "Sparks"? "Love"? That doesn't make any sense. I will figure out how to create life. I will make it work. And then, I'll be the one laughing at all of you! (LAUGHS MANIACALLY) - (GRUNTING) - (ALL LAUGHING) Get it off! Get it off! (GRUNTING) (SIGHS) Why don't we continue this discussion after class? Come find me in my workshop. Class dismissed! I will create life! - I'll show all of you! - (LAUGHING CONTINUES) Poor Sparky. Professor Steam, will any of that be on the final exam? Trying to, you know, be prepared. Mr. Rotter, you are far and away my least favorite student. (GROANS) Uh... Sparky? What do you want? Here to make fun of me, too? No, no, I just... I don't know. Wanted to tell you that I understand how you feel. What, you're an orphan, too? No. But I understand what it's like to not know about your scaritage. It makes you feel lost. And sad. But you're lucky you get to go to a school like Monster High, where everybody can be like your family. Family? (SCOFFS) Those nitwits aren't fit to be in my family. Which is why I'm going to create one. If I can just figure out how. (GRUNTS) (STRAINING) Here. How? How can you do that? Well, because I was created. And my father was, too. In a lab. It is possible! I knew it! - But how? - I don't know. I guess my grandfather somehow figured out that missing spark that Professor Steam was talking about. (STUTTERS) You have to tell me how it's done! Who is your grandfather? What is the secret? What am I missing? (STAMMERS) I shouldn't have said anything. I'm sorry, I have to go! Hey, Frankie, look who we found. You know, one day we're gonna look back on this and laugh. - (LAUGHING) - You really did it this time, mate. Your little stunt nearly caused us a lot of trouble. Oh, since when has a little curiosity caused any trouble? Oh, right. The whole "accidently sending us back in time" thing. Yeah, (INHALES) that was my bad. He built this Recharge Chamber. Said it would give him a boost of energy when he was inventing things. (GASPING) That's our ride. You ghouls coming? Just try and stop me. If I don't get my eyes on a celebrity blog soon, I'm gonna go batty. ROBECCA: "Hi, Dad. I miss you. Love, your daughter." After you. No, please, you first. I insist. Are we really doing this again? Wait! You can't leave yet! You have to show me how to create life! Friend of yours? Sparky, you shouldn't be here. You have to help me! I need to create my family. - (GROANS) - Ghoulia's right. Frankie, we have to go! Sparky, I have to go back to where I belong. Take me with you! (EXCLAIMING) Oops. (GROANS) Jinafire, let's go! In we go, calico. (SCREAMS) BOTH: After you! Come on, ghoulfriend! (GRUNTS) You're just going to leave without helping me? I'm sorry, Sparky. But I've got a feeling you're gonna create something wonderful here at Monster High. (GRUNTS) (EXCLAIMING) Just a few more adjustments on my Steam-a-tronic Key Timer and... (CRACKLING) I say, what's all this? Hmm. (MUMBLING) "Love, your daughter"? But I don't have a... Oh, construct a daughter! Now there's a challenge! Hang on... (ALL SCREAMING) No! No! (SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) Ghoulia, you okay? (GASPING) Good. Everybody else? - DRACULAURA: I'm all right. - ROBECCA: Me, too. (GASPS) Oh! (IN CLEO'S VOICE) Draculaura! Robecca! You've been fused together! Oh, my ghoul. (IN TORALEI'S VOICE) They're not the only ones. (YOWLS) (IN CLEO'S VOICE) O-M-Ra! (BOTH SCREAM) (IN LAGOONA'S VOICE) Crikey! (GASPS) (IN VENUS'S VOICE) What's going on? (IN CLAWDEEN'S VOICE) Oh, this is so freaky. Um, Ghoulia, I think we may have a problem. (GASPING) (IN DRACULAURA'S VOICE) How did this happen? It's like, we're Fusions! (IN LAGOONA'S VOICE) I don't understand. Am I still Lagoona? (IN JINAFIRE'S VOICE) Or am I Jinafire? - (SIGHS) - (GASPING) (SNIFFING) (IN VENUS'S VOICE) I can smell everything! (IN CLAWDEEN'S VOICE) Welcome to the wonderful world of werewolf noses. (IN CLEO'S VOICE) Of all the ghouls I could have been fused with, I end up with Toralei? (IN TORALEI'S VOICE) Just lucky, I guess. (IN CLEO'S VOICE) Ow! Cut it out! I am still the queen of this body! You're just visiting! (SCREAMING) Everybody! - Everybody, calm down! - (TORALEI MEOWS) We can figure this out. That time teleporter got us into this. I'm sure it can get us out. Somebody's just gonna have to fix it. (GASPS) You got this, little Miss Ghoulia. - We appreciate it. - You're the best, Ghoulia! (IN DRACULAURA'S VOICE) So, what do we do in the meantime? (IN LAGOONA'S VOICE) Well, there's no sense in waiting around down here watching Ghoulia work. (IN ROBECCA'S VOICE) Should we go back upstairs for the rehearsal? (IN CLAWDEEN'S VOICE) Sure, but what are we gonna tell Mr. Where when he asks us how we got this way? We can't tell anybody about the time teleporter. Your Mad Science class assignment was to fuse yourselves together? (SCOFFS) Works for me. Okay, places people. Places! This play isn't going to rehearse itself. (CHUCKLES) (GASPING) Oh. (IN CLAWDEEN'S VOICE) Did our going back in time somehow make his stink cologne get worse? (IN VENUS'S VOICE) Ooh, can I have my old nose back now? Today is the day we travel back in time! You have no idea. And action! (CLEARS THROAT) For 200 years, our great school has stood as a shining example of monster unity. All monsters, the big, the small, the hairy, all are welcome to join our freaky family. There! See? I told you Monster High is different. Come with us now as we take a look back at Monster High, a History of Exceptional Acceptance. Welcome to 1814. Oh, who's that I see coming this way? Why, it's none other than Monster High's own headless Headmistress Bloodgood! (IN CLEO'S VOICE) Welcome, monsters, one and all! Well, not bad. (SNORTING) I declare Monster High officially open. May her walls ever stand as a beacon of hope and acceptance for all monster kind. (IN TORALEI'S VOICE) Oh, yeah, and sorry about that cheap cologne smell! That would be our teacher, Mr. Where! (ALL LAUGHING) (SNIFFING) (IN CLEO'S VOICE) Will you cut it out? (IN TORALEI'S VOICE) What? I don't know what you're talking about. (IN CLEO'S VOICE) This is hardly the time or the place. As I was saying, it is my dream that these doors... Whoa! Ow! Stop it, Toralei. ...remain open to all. (EXCLAIMS) All right, Toralei! You wanna go? Let's go. (TORALEI MEOWS) (CLEO GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) Get out of me! Everybody remembers the great Zombie Migration of 1845, when the first zombies arrived on our haunted shores. - Groan. I'm a zombie, I guess. - Ditto. (IN DRACULAURA'S VOICE) Gentle zombies, bring us your tired, your undead, your sluggish masses yearning to... (EXCLAIMING) - Shuffle away, dude! - Shuffling! I'm shuffling! (CRASHING) (ALL GRUNTING) Every monster is welcome at Monster High. Every monster is family at Monster High. (IN CLAWDEEN'S VOICE) And every monster is, uh... Every monster is... (GASPING) (SNEEZING) (HOWLING) (GASPS) (ROARS) (IN CLEO'S VOICE) Get out of me! (IN TORALEI'S VOICE) Cut it out! (IN CLEO'S VOICE) No! You cut it out! (TORALEI MEOWS) (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) (IN LAGOON'S VOICE) Sorry! (YELLING) (GRUNTING) (SCREAMS) Um, and that, as they say, is history. These ghouls need some serious help. They're making me a nervous wreck! All right. Good. I just have a couple of notes. (TORALEI MEOWING) (SNEEZES) (SIGHS) It's time! Go on, talk to her. (STUTTERING) I don't know. Ahhh! (THUDDING) - (GASPS) - (GRUNTS) Um... Hey. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Hey, Neighthan. That was some rehearsal back there. Oh. You saw, huh? Your friends gave some fiery performances. (GIGGLES) So, what happened? Oh, well, I'm not sure. It's a long story. They've all turned into, well, Fusions. (GHOULS SCREAMING) And with two ghouls trying to operate one body at the same time, they're having a lot of trouble keeping control of their powers. I'm really worried they might get hurt. You must really care about them. Yeah. So much. And the thought of them in trouble, (GHOULS SCREAMING) I just get so emotional! - (CRACKLING) - Ah! What was that? (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) I'm not sure. That happens sometimes. I'm sorry. So, did you ghouls really mean all that stuff you said on stage? About Monster High being like a family? Yeah. Everybody's welcome at Monster High. - Freaky flaws and all. - Well, if that's really the case, I think we might be able to help your friends. "We"? (GASPING) Do you think she sees us? (GROANS) (GROANS CONTENTEDLY) (EXCLAIMS) (SIGHS) (COUGHS) (SIGHING) (GRUNTS) What happened? Mmm... (GROANS) Blinded by science! Fascinating! (CUCKOOS) (COUGHING) This is the future. Of course! I must not squander this opportunity. Who knows what futuristic technologies I now have access to. Perhaps this is where I'll find the missing ingredient I need to finally create life! Yes! (CHUCKLES) Hey, Sirena, got any skulls? Skulls? Uh, Sirena! Hmm. Go squish. Hey, look, it's the new Fusions. You ghouls put on one heck of a show this afternoon. Frankie, everybody, I'd like you to meet Avia Trotter, Harpy-Centaur, Bonita Femur, Skeleton-Moth, and Sirena VonBoo, Mermaid-Ghost. You ghouls gotta check out this bug. (IN CLAWDEEN'S VOICE) And what makes you think you'll be able to help us? (VENUS SNEEZES) (GRUNTS) Well, because we're Hybrids, you're kind of Hybrids, and we all have our freaky flaws to deal with. Like Bonita. - (CLANKING) - (SQUEALS) - (GASPS) What was that? - She's jumpy. Sirena is our free spirit. Yeah! Like that! Go, little guy, go. Oh, yeah. Just move your little legs. Oh! She gets distracted easily. - And Avia tends to... - I interrupt a lot. Right. Anyway, we understand what you're going through. And we want to help. (IN CLEO'S VOICE) Hybrids being nice? Are you sure we came back to the right timeline? Listen, we're sorry we gave you ghouls the cold shoulder before. We've had so many bad experiences with monsters at other schools, we just don't trust anyone anymore, you know? But Monster High is different. We're all a family. And now you're a part of it. Yeah. We'll see. (IN JINAFIRE'S VOICE) Neighthan, you did not tell us any of your freaky flaws. Well, I get some healing powers from my unicorn side. But my zombie side makes me, what would I call it... - (CLINKS) - (GRUNTING) Ow! I'm clumsy. (CHUCKLES) (GIGGLES) (SLURPS) (GASPING) (GASPING) (SPARKY LAUGHING MANIACALLY) (SCREAMS) (SCOFFS) Actually, I look pretty good in this one. Now, where was I? Oh, yes. (CONTINUES LAUGHING) All right, ghouls, listen up. We're going to pair each of you with a Hybrid mentor - to help you master... - (YAWNING) ...your new combined forms. Okay, who's ready to get to work? (GASPS) Good. I like your spirit, kid. (IN DRACULAURA'S VOICE) Um, I had no idea I was doing that! I've been fluttering from school to school ever since I was just a little larvette. It was always really tough, but I found that meditation would clear my head and help me feel in control. And I think it can help you, too. (IN CLAWDEEN'S VOICE) It's worth a shot. Okay, clear your mind. (IN VENUS'S VOICE) And clear. - Now, take a deep, soothing breath. - (INHALES) (EXHALES) - Oh... - (SIGHS) (IN CLAWDEEN'S VOICE) Hey, I think it's working! I feel totally in control. Not what I had in mind! (GRUNTING) (IN CLEO'S VOICE) So, you're saying you're going to make Toralei and I get along with each other by talking? (IN TORALEI'S VOICE) Yeah, uh, good luck with that. No, it's true. I've spent a lot of time in school counselors' offices just talking through what it's like to be Hybrid. I promise, talking really helps. (IN CLEO'S VOICE) All right, Toralei. Let's talk. (IN TORALEI'S VOICE) "All right, Toralei. Let's talk." - (IN CLEO'S VOICE) Oh, real mature. - (IN TORALEI'S VOICE) "Oh, real mature." (IN CLEO'S VOICE) Ugh! Why won't you take this seriously? (IN TORALEI'S VOICE) You're not the boss of me! Well, I guess technically they're talking. (IN CLEO'S VOICE) Back off! (TORALEI MEOWS) (SIGHS) (GRUNTING) (WHIMPERS) I've learned that surviving as a Hybrid means you have to take charge. And from where I've seen, your problem is that neither of you are taking charge of your body. You're both too polite. (IN DRACULAURA'S VOICE) Oh, right. I'll let Robecca take the lead. (IN ROBECCA'S VOICE) No, it should really be Draculaura. (IN DRACULAURA'S VOICE) That's so sweet. But I really do insist that... All right. All right. See, that's what I'm talking about. I don't care who it is, but somebody has to be the leader. Now, let's give it a try. And go! (EXCLAIMING) (GRUNTS) (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) SIRENA: So, like, the ghost side of my family never really got along with the mermaid side. But there was always one activity that could bring both families together. (IN LAGOONA'S VOICE) Um... Swimming? Oh, hey, sure, I love swimming! Crikey! I've never seen anybody pull off a quadruple reverse somersault without splashing. That was gorgeous! Like I said, we did a lot of swimming in my family. All right, Jinafire, you ready, mate? (IN JINAFIRE'S VOICE) Are you sure this is wise? (IN LAGOONA'S VOICE) Trust me. A good swim is just what we need to let off a little steam. Ooh. Too much steam. (INAUDIBLE) (WHISTLE BLOWS) (ALL GIGGLING) (IN CLEO'S VOICE) So there we are, stranded, all alone in the year 1814. Thanks to Touchy McPoke-at-Stuff here. And guess what she goes and does next. Don't tell me she wandered off on her own. (IN TORALEI'S VOICE) I wandered off on my own. (ALL LAUGHING) (IN CLAWDEEN'S VOICE) Spending time with you ghouls is totally inspiring me to create Fusion fashion designs. I have got to hand it to you ghouls. I can't believe how quickly you learned to control your Hybrid bodies. (IN DRACULAURA'S VOICE) Well, it's like that old saying goes. Hybrids make the best teachers. That's not an old saying. Oh, well, it should be. (GIGGLING) Oops. (IN JINAFIRE'S VOICE) No worries, love. (INHALES) (APPLAUSE) (IN CLAWDEEN'S VOICE) Yeah, yeah, showoff. Check this out. (INHALES) So fantastic. - Impressive. - They are beautiful. Who's got two green thumbs and a room full of freaky Fusion friends? (IN VENUS'S VOICE) This ghoul right here. (ALL LAUGHING) The lava is really quite lovely this time of day. Yeah. If you're still worried about your friends, you shouldn't be. They're going to be great tonight. Yeah, thanks to you and the Hybrids. No, I've been thinking about my grandfather a lot lately. I don't really know about him. Or myself. What do you mean? I know I have this. But do I have this? Professor Steam said you needed more than just some spare parts to create a life. Something inside. He called it a spark. So what did Victor Frankenstein discover that gave life to me? If I was built in some laboratory, am I even really alive at all? What if I'm just parts? That's some heavy stuff. You sure you don't want to go back to small talk about the lava? I'm sorry. (CHUCKLES) It's just, this whole scaritage project's put a lot of questions between my bolts. I just wish I could talk to my grandfather. (CRACKLING) (SCREAMING) Neighthan, I'm so sorry. You know how you know you're alive? You can feel it. Did you feel that? Yeah. Me too. But, hey, now we know you're really alive. (CHUCKLES) Maybe that was the spark your professor was talking about. (SIGHS) (GROANS) (GASPS) (GROANS) Ghoulia. There you are. Hey, your hair looks clawsome. (GASPING) You figured out how to separate us? That's great. (MUMBLING) Part of the time teleporter was stolen? How? (MUMBLING) This doesn't make any sense. Who would steal the time lens? What is going on? (CRACKLING) This is it. This is going to happen. I'm finally going to have my family. (CRACKLING) (CRACKLING) (GROWLING) Yes. Yes. It's alive. It's alive! I really hope it's alive, it's so embarrassing when it's not alive. (GROWLING) Excellent. And now, just a few more programming commands and Ancestral-bot 4.0 will be finished. And then the two of us will be... Doing whatever it is families do, in no time. Executing the family algorithm, applying the genealogy coefficient. All right, now just have to upload. (GROWLING) What? I don't have time for this. Work, you infernal futuristic computational system. AUTOMATED VOICE: Upload successful. So polite. You, you are my family. Family. Yes. It works. I created life. I knew I was just missing something before, but I've found the missing ingredient. I want to remember this moment forever. Wait, I know. Say "artificially intelligent family member constructed in a lab." (GROWLING) Bad. Blinded by science. You can't go. You're supposed to stay here, with me. Without a time teleporter, does that mean we're Hybrids forever? I can't be stuck with Toralei for the rest of my life. I thought you two were getting along now. That was then, this is now. Showtime, people. (APPLAUSE) Um... Hi. Hi, Frankie. (CLEARS THROAT) For 200 years, our great school has... (ALL SCREAMING) Family. Manny, I think it's time to go. Iris, I think you're right. Hey, where you going? The play is just getting good. (SCREAMING) (GROWLING) (ALL SCREAMING) Family. (ALL GASPING) What is that thing? DRACULAURA: That's the time teleporter lens. Okay, okay. Here I come. Family? Just stop rampaging for a second. Sparky? You followed us through the time portal? Just so you could build that? You say that like it's a bad thing. (CHUCKLES) It's okay, there's just something wrong with his programming. I can fix it. I think. Oh, this is totally going on the Fearbook profile. (GROANS) Yeah. He doesn't like that. Need family. Hey, put me down. No, put me down. Missing something. - Empty. - O-M-Ra! (SCREAMS) - (GRUNTING) - Ugh... Gross. Let us out of here. (MEOWS) Ew! All right. That, I did not see coming. That thing just absorbed my friends. Oh. He must realize something is missing and is trying to replace it. How do we shut it down? Shut it down? You can't. He's my family. You have a family, Sparky. And they're out there running for their lives from that thing you've created. We're your family. Monster High is your family. NEIGHTHAN: And we're a part of it. FRANKIE: Neighthan. Sparky. Look around. Is this what you had in mind when you built that thing? You don't understand. What can we do to help? You really see yourselves as a family? Freaky flaws and all. (ANCESTRAL BOT GROANS) You're right. We have to stop it. Yes, but how? I brought the construction to life with electricity. I suppose a large enough blast of energy - of an opposing polarity might stop it. - (GROANS) Yes, Hexiciah's Recharge Chamber. That could work. But we have to lead him down to my lab in the catacombs. All right then. Ghoulia, you and Sparky head down to the lab and prep the charging chamber. The rest of us will figure out a way to lead the thing down to the catacombs. All right, ghouls. Let's do this. Need family. We can't let it leave the school. A little steam power if you will, love? Gladly. (GROANS) Fire bad. It doesn't look happy. Family. Hold onto something. (SCREAMING) No. - Save us. - Frankie. (GROWLS) Okay, how are we going to get that thing to go to the catacombs? Because I don't think asking nicely is an option. Got an idea. Everybody, meet me at the door to the catacombs in the hallway. Missing something. FRANKIE: Hey, you, over here! Smile. (GROANS) Yuck, I'd say I got your bad side, but I'm not sure there's a good one. This way. (PANTING) Family. (SCREAMING) I'll save you, Frankie. - Ah... - Neighthan? Family? I'm okay. When we get back to the others, - can we skip telling them that last part? - (LAUGHING) My hero. (GROWLING) Ah, hey... Look over here. Hey, look over here. Look at this. Sirena! Be careful. Avia! Bonita! Looks like you two could use a lift? Hang on, Frankie. FRANKIE: Whoa! Over here. Over here. (FRANKIE PANTING) Did you get him to follow you? All righty. I think it's time for a little divine intervention. (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) No. We have to hurry. Do it, now! (GROWLING) It's not working. There's not enough energy. (GROWLING) - Frankie. - Help us. No! How could you do this? Those are my friends! (MUMBLING) Frankie, no. You took my friends from me. The ones that I love! Do you have any idea how that makes me feel? What's happening? What is that? I've seen that before. It's her spark. ALL: Frankie. No, Frankie. It is too dangerous. Give me back my friends. (GRUNTING) I don't understand. It's just electricity. No, it's something else. It's her emotions. Her love. Her life-force. It's her. Everything my creation isn't. The spark. That's what makes her alive. That's what I've been missing. Professor Steam was right. (ALL GASPING) I'm me again. What's going on? (SCREAMING) Frankie. You did it. (GROANS) Frankie! Frankie, you cannot give anymore. I have to save Draculaura and Robecca. Frankie! (GROWLING) Whoo-hoo! (LOUD THUD) (GROANS) - Oh, my ghoul, Frankie. - LAGOONA: Oh, Frankie. What did you do? She saved us. She saved all of us. Frankie. Come back to us. Wake up. This is all my fault. I should have listened to Professor Steam and not forced the creation of life before I understood it. Before you showed me there was really something in here. And now you've gone and used up all your spark. To save your friends. To save my family. I told you, Sparky. Don't give up, it is possible to create life. Just like my grandfather did so many years ago. Just like Victor Frankenstein. My name is Victor Frankenstein. Uh... I'm your grandfather. Sparky's your nickname? So I got to meet my grandfather after all. (DRACULAURA WEEPING) I can't believe Frankie's gone. Without her, we'd all still be part of that... That thing. (GROANS) I know, it doesn't even seem real. (GROANS) (GASPING) No. You don't mean... (MUMBLING) You're right. That just might work. But we have to get the polarity just right. Okay, I understand zombie, but I have no idea what any of this means. It means we're going to save Frankie. - GHOULS: What? - GHOULS: Really? You really think you can bring her back? Tell us you're not trying to be funny. The only funny thing happening right now is that Mermaid-Ghost is paying zero attention to this conversation. We can do this. But first, I think this Recharge Chamber is going to need a little love. All right. Let's save Frankie. Almost ready. This has to work. We have to save Frankie. Now, let's create life! Again. (CRACKLING) Come on, Frankie. Come back to us. SPARKY: It's not working. I don't understand. Maybe you're still missing something. Professor Steam? Dad! Oh, Dad, I missed you. Nice to meet you, my daughter. You are just perfect. Hmm. It looks as though I did an amazing job building you. Or rather, will do an amazing job, at some point. And you, Victor Frankenstein, are late for our conversation after class, by about 200 years, if I'm not mistaken. And I'm here to bring you back to our time, where you belong. But it looks like we have a ghoul to save first. Ah. I don't understand, Professor. I was sure this would work. Didn't you listen to anything I said before? Creating life takes more than just what's up here. I know, it takes the spark. But it's all gone. Frankie used it all up. How can something be gone that's inside of every living thing? Oh, Frankie... Draculaura. How did you do that? I don't know. I just closed my eyes and thought about Frankie. So, we all have the spark? Come on, everybody, together. Think of your best Frankie memory. I remember when Frankie helped bring me back to life. She planned a surprise party for my sweet 1,600. She made us feel like we belong. (GASPS) (MUMBLING) (CELL PHONES RINGING) HEATH BURNS: Save Frankie? She freed me from the lantern. She kept me from doing that dumb thing. She helped me find my lost love. Please. Save Frankie. We've gotta save her. We've gotta save Frankie. ALL: Yeah. Save Frankie. ALL: Save Frankie. Save Frankie. Save Frankie. (BEEPING RAPIDLY) Save Frankie. ALL: Save Frankie. Save Frankie. Save Frankie. Save Frankie. Pass it on. Did it work? CLEO: Frankie? Come back to us, Frankie. Ghoulfriend, if you're taking your sweet time for dramatic effect, you're killin' us over here. FRANKIE: Did I miss anything? ALL: Frankie! It worked. She's back. (ALL CHEERING) I was so worried. I did it. I created life. We did it. (CHUCKLES) All right, Victor Frankenstein. It's time to go. Thank you, Frankie. I told you it was possible to create life. No, not for that. Thank you for showing me that I'm not alone. That I do have a family. Take care of yourself. Grandpa. Miss you already, Dad. FRANKIE: Which brings us to the end of our bite-centennial celebration. But our story doesn't end there. Because the history of Monster High is still being written every single day. And as we move forward into the future, we will continue our rich tradition of accepting anybody who comes through those doors. Whether they're vampire or werewolf, creepy or freaky, or Hybrid. It's okay. You're one of us now. (ALL CHEERING) Together we are Monster High. (ALL CHEERING) So, does this mean you'll stick around for a while? What? Sure. Wouldn't wanna miss being a part of this freaky family. (ALL CHEERING) So, that's our little story about family. The Hybrids finally found the home they were looking for at Monster High. Sparky... Uh, Grandpa Victor went back to his own time where he used the secret of the spark to build the family he was looking for. And even though the ghouls aren't fused together anymore, they're still pretty much inseparable. Fusion fashion. How clawsome are those designs? And as for me? Well, let's just say that after a crazy family adventure like that, I had plenty to talk about for my scaritage project. Check it out. The real family photo album. My parents had to hide it until after I met Grandpa... Uh, Sparky. This time I got an A. Favorite student, right here. So, there you have it. I got an A, Monster High got some voltageous new students, and Ghoulia... Well, Ghoulia got a brand new laboratory. (GASPING) (GROWLING) (SIGHS)
