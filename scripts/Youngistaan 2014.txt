By the way, what's happening with our game? I've given it to Stan for beta testing. I guess boss will have a look at it today. What do you think? Is the deal possible for us? Has anything ever been impossible for us? You did the same thing again. Look off the road and you'll meet.. An accident. Why did I employ you guys? Answer me, Abhimanyu. Sir, to develop games. Why did I employ Stan? To test games. - And look what's happening. Stan is developing a game for me and you're having free coffee. Sir, Stan? Yes. Stan. He just brought me a fabulous game. And the game is called Ultimate Kick. Stan stole our game. As well as the title. Sir, actually, this game.. - Zafar.. What? We're sorry, sir. We'll try harder next time. - What? I will see. What nonsense are you blabbering? Tell him. - I'm telling you. Tell him. - We'll handle this later. - Let's go. - Abhi. Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Yeah! Yeah! Let's go! Let's go! Abhi. Hey, independent woman. Independent girl, mister. Not woman. Okay, tell me, how are your dogs? They are very nice, but they aren't mine. Poor summer interns like me make pocket money.. ..by walking the dogs which belong to others. My love, I too am a dog. Why don't you take some money and go on a stroll with me? Definitely. You know what, Abhi? You must be the first dog in the world to pay to go for a stroll. Yeah, sort of. Why sort of? Will tell you later. Long story. I'll see you. Bye, baby. Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Hey! I will never marry you. Oh really? Fine. We've been living together for four years. Three more years and the government of India will consider us married. Oh really? - Yes. Really! Really! My dogs! - Okay, so now they are yours! Tell me. - Put me down. Get this one. Guys, please. Stop behaving like lovelorn lovers of a tragedy film. By the way, I am straight. You need to justify that? Shut up! You didn't speak when you should have! Give me your sense of your honest boyfriend. Stan stole our game. He didn't say anything to our boss. And when I tried to stand up, he asked me to keep quiet. Idiot. Scoundrel. Hey, he is my boyfriend. Don't call him a scoundrel. Oh, so he is your boyfriend. And what about me getting screwed.. ..with you guys since the past four years? We've been working on this game for six months. Six months! And you just let it go. Who said I just let it go? Buddy, there's a right time for everything. Right time. - It's our game. We have the codes. We know about the bugs. Now we'll talk to the boss on Monday. Stan will be fired for sure. And boss will also feel guilty. Double brownie points. See. - You like me. I know you like me. You like me. - Sorry. I once again doubted you. Come give me a hug. Come on. - Stop all this. Guys, before you hug and get cozy, can we go and have some fun? Yeah. - Okay, give me 15 minutes. Let me finish this project. Fifteen minutes. All work and no fun makes Abhimanyu boring. Oh really? Japan! Love in Tokyo! "We're funky! We're a little junkie!" "We're also called monkeys." "We're funky! We're a little junkie!" "We're also called monkeys." "If we start drinking.." "We're guzzlers!" "If we start drinking.." "We're guzzlers!" "We're guzzlers!" "We're monkeys!" "Not half, we're fully crazy." "We are insane and we are insanity." "We're guzzlers!" "We're senti!" "Not half, we're fully crazy." "We sleep in liquor barrels." "Japan!" "Love in Tokyo!" "Whether it's tequila or whiskey.." "It's got to get in." "And if I get sloshed.." "Then I'm bound to make a mess." "If the Pundit said so, I'll get married." "The girl is guaranteed to have her life ruined." "God, You alone know." "We just join our hands and praise You." "London, Japan, come on, up your hands." "Because I'm gonna rock this party like I'm Shaktiman." "We hide our heart's struggle." "If in the mood, we got a funky tattoo done." "We hide our heart's struggle." "If in the mood, we got a funky tattoo done." "We got a tattoo done!" "After we got a tattoo done.." "We made everyone see that tattoo." "Give me a hug my friend." "Let me post that photo." "Don't block me." "Otherwise I'll die." "The bell that can't be rung." "We're that bell." "For everyone.." "Which opens.." "The one that opens for everyone.." "We are that latch!" "We're guzzlers!" "We're monkeys!" "Not half, we're fully crazy." "We are insane and we are insanity." "We're guzzlers!" "We're senti!" "Not half, we're fully crazy." "We sleep in liquor barrels." There are some protocols that must be followed. But she wants to meet my father. I understand that. SPG is with her in the hotel. She'll be fine. Apart for being your father.. ..Dashrath is also the prime minister of India. Different media personals and I wonder who all are there. I know that I don't have much time. Tomorrow will be your first public appearance. Akbar will take you to a press conference. Where my health will be discussed. Don't be weak. Answer every question very firmly. But papa, I.. Have I ever asked you for anything in the past 13 years? Akbar.. Akbar.. My friend.. Abhi.. Currently we are doing everything in our capacity.. ..to bring his organs back to their normal function. His condition is critical. However, there is hope. I've never witnessed a stronger will to fight cancer. Sir, one question please. One question. Anirudh. Anirudh! - Yes. Just one question. Thank you. Thank you very much. Abhimanyu, did you speak to the prime minister? Yes. That's all for today. Thank you. Thank you. Akbar sir! Akbar sir! One question. Thank you. - Abhimanyu! Just a minute. "Almighty, why is there grief in this world?" "Bestower of spiritual treasures.." "Bestower of spiritual treasures.." "Bestower of spiritual treasures.." "Is a grace to the world." "Bestower of spiritual treasures.." "Bestower of spiritual treasures.." "Bestower of spiritual treasures.." "Is a grace to the world." "I am crazy... Bestower of spiritual treasures.." "I am crazy..." "Almighty, why is there grief in this world?" "I am crazy about Almighty." "I am crazy about Almighty." "For a feature so deep, how can it be so easily ruined?" "For a feature so deep, how can it be so easily ruined?" "I am crazy about Almighty." "I am crazy..." Abhi! Thank God, you are alright. What's happening, Abhi? Where were you? You know what these guys did? They took my cell phone away. Without landline. TV, Wi-fi. They disconnected everything. It felt like they detained me. Detained me as if I've done something wrong. Is it a crime to be your girlfriend? Yes? You know.. I came here so that I could be by your side. Does your dad know that I've been kept here,.. ..under watch, for so many days? Yes? Papa is no more. Abhi.. Abhi! I'm sorry, Abhi. Abhi, no.. 'Mom and dad died in an air crash.' 'I couldn't even say bye to them.' 'You at least met your father.' 'India is generally a young and a sentimental country.' 'Times are changing.' 'It's time for this country's politics,.. ..thoughts and methods to change.' Shubho Da, we've delayed the decision extensively. India is waiting. We need to elect the chief advisor to the supreme commander of... ... India's three defense forces. Not a gardener for the Moghul gardens. There will be a delay. Snap polls? In the election year? What are you saying, Murli? The government is so unpopular, we'll be decimated. UDA will be finish us. Fine. Anyway, you think all my suggestions are incorrect. Not at all. Absolutely wrong. I proposed Ajay Thakur's name on your suggestion. Shubho Da, why just mine? Yours, Murli's, In fact the name of every senior member of the party was discussed. Who will lead such an unpopular government in the election year? It will be a career blunder. It would be wise to brainstorm now and make the right decision. It's my job to reason it with the coalition partners. I'm with you, Ajay. But it's not as easy to handle coalition partners as you think. Shubho Da? - Anything other than snap polls. No one should be shocked by what I'm about to say. Abhimanyu Kaul. Who? Dashrath Kaul's only son. So according to you... ...you can pick up any Tom,.. ..Dick and Harry from the sidewalk and make him the.. Prime minister of India. I second Abhimanyu Kaul's candidature. I guess he's just.. - Twenty-eight. Anand Mishra. Minister of State. Finance. He's just 30. When we can think of proposing his name then why not Abhimanyu's? We need someone who can see this election year through. Yes. And we can make Abhimanyu do that. The President has given time until tomorrow. As an interim prime minister, I don't have much time. Don't leave anything for tomorrow. World's largest democracy is technically.. ..running without an elected prime minister. It's up to you, Ajay. After becoming the prime minister.. ..Abhimanyu has 6 months to become an MP The age limit in Rajya Sabha is 30. There is an option of Lok Sabha. Yes. The next three months will be crucial for Abhimanyu. If he manages to survive then we'll make Abhimanyu.. ..win from Sitapur in the by-elections.. ..and get him to Lok Sabha. End of argument. Sister! How dare you enter like this? Please co-operate, ma'am. We need to check the house for security purposes. Who are you guys? Supriya, call the police. No, aunt. Abhimanyu will take care of this. Sir has come with us. Abhi, what's happening? We need to talk. What's happening? Listen to me very carefully. This is what is going to happen in the next three days. A ceremony will be organized in the.. ..Ashoka Hall of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Where I'll be sworn in by the honorable president of India.. ..as the prime minister of this country. Abhi, it's not funny. So you're being serious. Abhi, I'm not going to let this happen. Anvi, nothing will happen. What "nothing will happen"! Abhi,.. ..you promised that you won't join politics. Now I will tell you what will happen, Mr. Abhimanyu Kaul. You will be the butt of all jokes. They'll make your cartoons. You'll be a laughing stock for the whole country. And these politicians will use you and screw you. And yes, you will also lose your girlfriend. Anvi, come on. Abhi, did you not promise me? Yes, I had. But I, too, didn't want this to happen. - Tell me something. What is your qualification to run the biggest democracy in the world? Fate. Fate! This is your excuse? You don't become the prime minister of this country with an excuse. My father told me something in Orlando. Something I didn't tell you. After I die, a meeting will be called.. ..in the political circles of Delhi. Where they will decide my successor. But nobody will take the responsibility. When Shubho Da and Ajay Thakur propose your name.. You shouldn't decline the offer. Your father is going to die. Just do this for me. Abhi, will we be able to lead a normal life? Perhaps not. But I'll continue to love you. Don't give me that filmy line. What are you thinking? Where will we stay? Uncle, Anvi will stay with me. What? - Anvita will stay with me, right? No, sir. - What? Sir, this is not Japan. This is India. And willingly or unwillingly... ... you are about to become the prime minister of India. She cannot stay with you. Then where will she stay? That, not even the RAW chief can tell you. Sir, why are my photos being deleted from my Facebook account? My girlfriend was enquiring. Anything else, ma'am? Get me some poison. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Did ma'am order something? Yes. Poison. Where were you? Cabinet secretariat. With whom? Secretary R. Is she hot? What are you saying? Secretary R means the RAW chief. He was updating me on the issues related to our country's security. It's a routine. And before you ask me why, let me tell you.. I'm the PM designate of this country. And I should know who is a friend and who is an enemy. Understood? Okay, I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm used to it now. Will they be joining us on our dates as well? Can't help it. What's the salary they are paying you? 50,000. 50,000 dollars? - Rupees. Rs. 50,000? And you're the prime minister of this country. Abhi, 6 lakhs! You were getting 6 lakhs in Japan! There are a lot of allowances as well. There are perks. What allowances and perks? What was Akbar saying? Only I can stay. What about me? So only I cannot stay. Love, try to understand. There are some protocols which need.. Protocols, my ass! You are simply dumping me! Marry me. Sure. Can we go back to Japan and get married? Is it a condition? No. This is my protocol. Abhi, you tell me. We were so happy together for 3 years in Japan. Now just because we are in India.. And here people expect us to get married, we should get married? We made all our decisions earlier. So this decision should also be ours. Abhi, we will get married. But we both will decide when. Hello, Akbar uncle.. I need an apartment. Don't you think it's too long? Sir, this is supposed to be this long. It has been specially called for you from Aligarh. Really? Sure? - Yes. Did you like it? That Anvita will decide. - Who Anvita? You've asked this question here but dare not ask it outside. Things are not all hunky dory these days. Perfect. Thank you. - Son.. Hi, aunt. I needed an elder's blessing. God bless you. Did Anvi come out of the room? Please don't mind that. She has become very insecure after losing her parents. And there has turned possessive for those who are close to her. Give her some time. She'll understand. It's okay. I know. I'll make a move. Thank you. But aunt.. - There's no excuse to behave like this. Why did you need to come here to change? We've booked the entire floor in Hyatt for you. Did you book an apartment? You'll have to reside at 7 Racecourse. You'll have to follow some protocols. Enough protocols, uncle. Sir. Let's go to Rashtrapati Bhavan... ... for the live telecast of Abhimanyu.. ..Kaul's swearing-in ceremony. Today 28-year-old Abhimanyu Kaul... ... will be sworn-in as the world's youngest prime minister. He seems to be of our age. Do you think he'll be able to handle it? I guess. I.. - I, Abhimanyu Kaul.. Do swear in the name of God.. Do swear in the name of God.. That I will bear true faith and allegiance.. That I will bear true faith and allegiance.. To the constitution of India. To the constitution of India. As by law established. As by law established. That I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India. That I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India. That I will faithfully and conscientiously.. ..discharge my duties. That I will faithfully and conscientiously.. ..discharge my duties. As prime minister for the union. As prime minister for the union. And that I will do right to all manner of people. And that I will do right to all manner of people. In accordance with the constitution and the law. In accordance with the constitution and the law. Without fear or favor, affection or ill-will. Without fear or favor, affection or ill-will. Congratulations. Thank you so much. He became a PM just because he's from a political family. So what's wrong? I wonder if such a young boy will be able to run the government or not. Only time will tell how good his ideas.. ..and policies are for our country. The PM is here. Sir.. Sir? Cabinet secretary. Suhasini Singh Deo. Please remain seated, sir. Actually I was on leave. I'm sorry I wasn't here. Your right hand, sir. This is my right hand. I meant I am your right hand, sir. - Sorry. Welcome. Heartiest congratulations, Mr. Prime Minister Sir. Thank you. Uncle, can I have some water please? Of course. So shall we go? Where to, sir? There are some people waiting for you. Who? Some very distinguished and responsible people.. ..who will help you run this country. You can say this is the central nervous system of our country. And you control it. Sir. - Thank you. Sir, that's the nuclear button. Sir, you head the NCA. Nuclear command authority. God forbid if you ever have to give a command of nuclear attack.. ..then the national security advisor will execute it. Hi. The NSA will brief you upon that later, sir. Thank you, Ms. Suhasini. Where to next, sir? New Friends colony. Drop me. What is it, uncle? Nothing, sir. Madam called. Anvita? - Yes, sir. What did she say? The situation is bad. You are here. Cheers, Mr. Prime Minister. Cheers. Abhi, I forgot to ask this in the morning. Who got you this attire? Akbar. Akbar. Akbar! Of course! Akbar! What else does this Akbar do apart from buying clothes for you? He's the PA to the PM. So Akbar is your personal assistant, right? Do one thing, call him here. Anvi.. Call him here right now. Who's calling you right now? It's Akbar. Akbar.. Take his call. - I'll talk to him tomorrow. No, no, no. Akbar is important. Anvi, I said, I'll talk to him tomorrow. We can talk later. We'll talk tomorrow because I am not important, right? Akbar is important. Not more than you. You know that. Take his call. Answer it. Akbar is important. We'll talk tomorrow. - Yes, uncle? - We're coming back. We've found a bungalow. But we'll have to make sure you.. ..both reach there before the media finds out. Sir, please be ready. But uncle, I asked for an apartment. Do you think this is a joke? But uncle, I can really stay in an apartment. You can stay in an apartment but the.. ..prime minister of this country can't. Uncle, but.. Hello? Akbar uncle, Anvita is my support system. I don't exist without her. Sir, there's a meeting with the export promotion council on Monday. On Tuesday All India Institute of Medical Sciences.. ..are felicitating some French cancer specialists. And sir, President Barack Obama has sent you a congratulatory message. Abhi.. My head is blasting. Uncle, can I get a Disprin? If you can't get Disprin, I'll make do with coffee. Sir. I'll get it. Go and freshen up. It will come. What? - Coffee and Disprin will come. You go and have a shower. That will come, but why are you talking in this manner? How? As if this is the first time I've asked you for coffee and Disprin. Lord. It's not always like this. I've gone through the list. There's a special case in it. The Basket file, sir. Its enquiry has been going on since the last two years. What's the update on that? Sir, the enquiry is in a very crucial stage. Sir wants the see the enquiry speed up a little. So how close are we? 200 meters. At this very moment, an agent of the agency.. ..is waiting for the proposed target in some coffee shop in Bratislava. You guys are good. - It's our job, sir. So keep giving an update on the development. Sure. Sure, sir. - Alright. That's it. Excuse us, sir. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Here are some select files on the investigation. Hello? The coffee was awesome. I love you, Mr. Prime Minister. Okay. Say I love you too! Uncle, can you please send these files home? I'll go through them. Of course. No problem. Not at all. This one too. Is Akbar with you? Uncle.. Is there anything else? No, no. Say I love you. I love you, baby. Mr. Murli! Welcome. Hello, Suhasini. - How are you, Murli? Good. I'll.. I'll see you later. Mr. PM.. You are looking very handsome, sir. Thank you, Mr. Murli. How are you? - Very good. How are you? Thank you. There's a comprehensive amendment in the taxation bill. There are minimum changes in Direct Taxes. But Indirect Taxes have been consolidated. Like excise duty, service tax.. Sir, I know what indirect taxes mean. Have we given any relief to people below 35 years? To whom? And what relief? To the youth of this nation, Mr. Murli. For example, a 22-year-old engineering graduate.. ..who has just joined an IT firm.. What opportunities are we giving him to prosper? Is this some kind of a joke? No, I meant, on basic loans like home.. ..and education bank should charge.. ..the youth interest only on working days and not on bank holidays. This will provide quite a relief to them. Mr. Prime Minister, do you have any idea.. ..how much loss the exchequer will incur because of this? Yes, but.. These are complicated issues. Don't worry, sir. I'll take care of it. What is the biggest challenge this country is facing today? Please describe it in one word. In a diverse country like India,.. ..you expect me to question in one word? Sorry, you expect me to answer in one word? I'm watching it. I don't like to see myself on television. It feels strange. In our country, common sense is not common anymore. If we work on common sense then a lot of challenges will be met. This is the first time I'm watching you on television. And for some strange reason, it's turning me on. You've asked such a loaded question. I think a country runs on willpower and not on programs. We just need to work a little on that willpower. Okay, come here. Finance Minister came out of Prime Minister Abhimanyu Kaul's office.. ..and said that he is a good boy. What does this mean? How was your first experience with the prime minister? He's a good boy. Sir, sometimes such Disappointments happen during investigations. But RAW chief is very hopeful. We'll surely crack the Basket file case. We'll get a lead, sir. For now, I have got this letter, uncle. A 50-year-old woman was gang-raped by 6 men. And so far no FIR has been filed. Because those who did this disgraceful.. ..deed were influential people. I wonder how did this letter manage to reach me. So what have you decided, sir? A complaint center. A grievance cell. A place where more such letters can reach me. And some action can be taken on them. What is it, Akbar uncle? Nothing, Abhimanyu. I'm missing Mr. Dashrath. Before he fell ill he used to often tell me.. "Akbar, there should be a grievance cell in the PMO." This is Mr. Dashrath's pen. He gave it to me. Now it belongs to you, sir. Mine? Thank you, uncle. Did you make preparations to leave for Agra, sir? Yes. You are coming with me for the party executive meeting, right? Sir, please don't be so cruel on civil servants. Please go, sir. What do you mean? I mean, go. I'll handle that, sir. Excuse me. - Thank you. You are going to Agra? - Yes. Why? Abhi, you had promised that.. ..the first time I see Taj, it will be with you. Anvi, you made me leave such an important discussion.. ..to discuss your picnic plans? Yes. I can make you come from anywhere. I'll take you with me. Okay? Happy? - Thank you, Abhi. I love you, Abhi! Get used to these voices, Farz. You'll hear them often. Shubho Da. Shubho Da.. Please agree, Shubho Da. Our party will get into trouble, Shubho Da. Listen to me. Please agree. - Please agree. Our party will get into trouble, Shubho Da. Please agree, Shubho Da. Please agree, Shubho Da. Our party will get into trouble, Shubho Da. Please agree, Shubho Da. - Mr. Murli, the state cannot be divided. Please come back on the stage. He won't! He won't! He won't! Uncle.. What's happening? Mr. PM, he calls you a good boy. You saw how he misbehaved with Shubho Da. And then stepped down from the stage and created a scene. Just because he wants to make one of his.. ..loyalists the CM of this newly proposed state. What now? Tell him the state cannot be divided. This demand is unreasonable. Mr. Murli, this demand is unreasonable. The state cannot be divided. Mr. Murli, I'm requesting you. Please come here. Please talk to your supporters. - He won't! He won't! He won't! He won't! He won't! He won't! What happened? I'm lost. I took up this responsibility at my father's behest. Against our wishes. Now look, nothing is being done on an important enquiry. It's not going anywhere. I gave a good advice to the finance minister. And that has hurt his ego. And there is so much division within the party ranks that they treat.. ..the opposition and their own party members as the same. There is no team spirit, Anvita. I have so much to say but no one is ready to listen to me. Abhi, you head the government of this country. If you say something valid then they will have to listen to you. All this is much more difficult than I thought it would be. Since when did you start sulking? You've always been the problem solver. You'll find a solution to this problem as well. Okay now, let's not talk about this. We're going to Taj! And do you know? All work and no fun makes the prime minister boring. Come on, cheer up. I'm so excited. Come here. "Listen, these minarets made of marble.." "Are nothing in comparison to your mesmerizing beauty." "Henceforth, you'll rein my heart." "The crown belongs to you." "Listen, these minarets made of marble.." "Are nothing in comparison to your mesmerizing beauty." "Henceforth, you'll rein my heart." "The crown belongs to you." "Listen, these minarets made of marble.." "In your absence, my heart beats were slow." "From the time I have met you.." "Linked to you, my heart has started soaring high." "Listen, these stars in the sky.." "Are nothing in comparison to your mesmerizing beauty." "Look, my dreams having passed through your dreams.." "Tell the nights, they are the mornings that have come true." "Listen, any beauty in this world.." "Is nothing in comparison to your mesmerizing beauty." "Henceforth, you'll rein.." Yes, Akbar uncle? Sir, please switch on the television. It's urgent. Sir, I had got a regular dry check done before you reached Taj. It's obvious that there has been a security lapse somewhere. I've been grilling them since last night. Sir, some damned paparazzi sent these pictures to a website. Media picked them up from there. Uncle, this has been going on since morning? - Yes. Oh God. Sir, where's Anvita? 'This country seems to be losing its trust on this good boy.' She is here. - Please change the channel. Abhi, in the newspaper.. 'Our prime minister stays with his girlfriend?' 'What's your take on that?' It's wrong, ma'am. This is wrong. 'He is in a live-in relationship." 'What kind of a leader is this PM?' 'He is in a live-in relationship." Hey, look, our PM is in a live-in relationship, It's okay. He too has a personal life. 'All the buzz that has being going around about..' '..our prime minister staying with a girl, with his girlfriend.' 'What do you think about that?' Look ma'am, he's a 28-year-old boy. What else can you expect from a 28-year-old boy? So what, madam? I too stay with my girlfriend. Abhimanyu Kaul.. - Shame on you! Shame on you! The situation there will be a little heated up, sir. Be careful. I am sorry, sir. I won't say a word. I'll handle it. In a country of 1.3 billion, a girl seems to enjoy all the attention of the PM. Welcome, Mr. PM. Please have a seat. I was in conversation with Mr. Kutty and he asked me.. ..when the PM is coming there to stay. He wants to know whether he is cleaning up.. ..the Panchwati for no reason. To come straight to the point, it's decorum that supports this party. Party workers will be upset if this continues. And it's impossible to run a party or a government with upset workers. You are right, Ajay. Mr. Murli.. Did you include my suggestions in the taxation bill? Sir? I thought that was a joke. Sir, neither was I joking that day nor am I joking now. In India, on an average, each state has 65 bank holidays. And I believe that if banks don't charge interest.. ..on the loans given to youth, on bank holidays.. The local exchequer will surely suffer a loss. But you can easily manage this loss. But you cannot even imagine the youth confidence... ...that you will win because of this. Don't worry, Mr. Murli. I'll take care. So this is it. The opening league match between India and Pakistan.. ..of the Fifth Asian Champion's Trophy. Now I would like to invite our chief guest. The Honorable Prime Minister of India. Mr. Abhimanyu Kaul. Best of luck, guys. I too have booed a lot in college. But not on anyone's personal life. We're all here to watch a sport today. Let's keep our grudges for some other day. Yeah? And may the best team win. The Honorable Prime Minister of India.. ..will now declare the games open in his own style. I declare the games.. ... Open. "The ones who are determined.." "The ones with honest dreams.." "This is our identity." "Youngistan." 'Mr. Murli Mukundan..' '..has moved from the all important position of the Finance Minister..' '..and been told to hold position of the Deputy Prime Minister.' 'According the our sources..' '...the reason behind this change is the increasing differences..' '..between Prime Minister Abhimanyu Kaul and Mr. Murli Mukundan.' This is what is called politics, Akbar. PM gave him a promotion but took away his powers. Right? I'll take care of that. Yes, even Murli. Hail Motherland. Sir. - Sit down. Sit down, guys. Sir, how was the workout? - Very good. Sir, UN wants to confirm your visit. Should I respond? - Yes, please. And when the UN's official list is out, I want a copy of it. Sir. Sir, the leader of the opposition has asked for an appointment. What for? - He didn't tell. Get the basics right first. Sir.. Sir, I need your signature. Sign please. Sir, the Finance Minister is on the line. Former Finance Minister. Put him on hold. Well, what did you have for breakfast, my queen? Ma'am didn't have anything since morning, sir. What do you want to eat? Tell me. An omelet? Pasta? Pizza? I know you like pizza. Excuse me? Will all of you also have pizza? Sir.. - Yes? Is that Dominos? Sir, the opposition leader has given a very prerogative statement. It's all over the news. That's what I was telling Shrikant. Get the basics right first. - Right. Anvi. Anvi. You okay? What's wrong? I'm pregnant. Since when are you vomiting? From the past 2-3 weeks. Where's the father? Who's the father? I'm the father. What do you want to do? If you are even a little bit scared.. Then think that we are in Japan and forget that I'm the PM. Now tell me, what do you want to do? I want to be a mother. Come here. It will all be good. Sir, a girl has sent a letter to the grievance cell formed by you. She refers to you as her brother. And she why is a woman referred as the weaker sex and not a man? And how can I be weak when I have you as my brother? And she has given a very interesting suggestion towards the end. That one should remove this word from the dictionary. She has a point. And she considers me as her brother. - True. So I'll have to perform by duty. Good luck, sir. We'll handle this in the office tomorrow. Okay, sir. - Okay then. Not everything should be about politics. Times have changed, but it's still a woman who gives birth. Thank you. Take care of both of them. And do as Anvi says. Sir, important intelligence brief right away. Indian Air base. What happened? What is it? See it for yourself. This is Boris Romano. Interpol caught him from some Slovakian suburb. Two Indian officers are with them. The information we are getting to know through... ...this interrogation are pretty shocking. The initial transcript of the interrogation is kept before you. Sir, how long will it take for this enquiry to become public? Three months, I guess? Yes, sir. Anvi, what are you doing? What are you doing? Distracting my mind. Why? I want to have 'Matka Kulfi'. Anvi.. It's 4:00am.. - But the party is still on! Come on! - What "come on"! Twenty-four hours I stay within these four walls. Two lakhs protocols follow me like my own tail. I can't go here. I can't go there. I cannot do this. I cannot do that. I cannot invite my friends over. And you know what is the funniest? I've started talking to myself. Humum, my queen. Anything else? No, just feed me some 'Kulfi'. Farz, please try and understand. I'm sorry, sir. But I am in-charge of your safety. I cannot go against the PM security protocol, sir. AbhI! If you are so concerned about my security... ...then forget about the protocol. But how will we go, sir? My Suzuki is parked close to the backdoor. It's a dependable vehicle. Let's leave quietly. Okay, sir. Give me two minutes, I'll go and get ready. Good. Good. Meanwhile, I'll too go and change. Farz, we're going to have 'Matka Kulfi' and not on a war. Ma'am to go with the PM sir at this hour.. ..to have 'Matka Kulfi' is as good as going for a war. Sir, please duck. Cops, straight ahead. - What? Sir, they will faint if they see you. It'll create an unnecessary scene. Please duck, sir. Deshiram, I don't want liquor. I want 'Makta Kulfi'. 'Makta Kulfi'? Who is dying to have 'Makta Kulfi' at 4:30am? I'd like to meet that person. Come with me. I'll introduce you. Come on. How's yours? - Yum. Let me taste. Eat yours. Just like Lord Krishna gorging on butter. Sukhiram, get some tissues. We don't have any tissue. Then get a napkin. Here.. - Get lost! Sir, I hope he's doing his job well. He has a very sharp eye. If he isn't doing his job well then let me know. A whack or two and he will be fine. He must be IG Farz Singh while on his job. But for me, he is Fajju for me. Deshiram, tell me, what can I do for you? Sir, can I get a license to run a five-star hotel? You okay? One second. Farz, can I borrow Rs. 500? I'm not carrying any cash on me. Sure, sir. - I'll pay you back. Sir, what are you saying? Who wants it back, sir? Here you go, sir. Give it to Deshiram. You will make me take money from the prime minister? There's a buzz in the opposition. No one knows anything. You should ask what secret enquiry the PMO is doing. How can I ask, Ajay? And what should I ask? Forgive me, sir, for making you wait for so long. PM has been busy resolving the.. ..police firing issue since the morning. Why did the prime minister summon us? Sir, the President's term is about to get over. The opposition has chosen their candidate. PM wants you to consult him on this. Good, at least the PM thinks we are good for something. Just like Dashrath. - Shubho Da. Dashrath too used to scatter all the documents.. ..while working in this office. He used to say, how will one gather if one doesn't scatter? Tell me, what made you think of me, Mr. PM? I wanted to talk to you about the Presidential elections. Opposition has made their decision. And now it's our turn. I kept thinking about it the whole night.. ..but I couldn't understand anything. Then in the morning, I asked myself.. What would've my father done? You must've thought of someone at least. You have served this country with my father and even before that. In tomorrow's meeting, for this country's Chief Executive and... ...the Supreme Commander of all three defense forces.. I am going to propose your candidature. Prime Minister said something... ...which I've been trying to say since the past 5 years. 'We'll have to take Shubho Da... ...in confidence before the enquiry becomes public.' 'If Shubho Da gets distanced from active politics..' '..then we won't need to take him in confidence.' I, Shubhodeep Ganguli, do swear in the name of God.. That I will faithfully execute... ...the office of President of the republic of India. 'Hi, everybody.' 'Welcome. Greetings.' 'How are you?' 'Everyone's fine?' - Anvi. 'Cool.' 'Come on, let me tell you a story.' - Abhi, have you seen my pen drive? All my songs are in it. - 'Better still, I'll show you a story.' I am sorry. For what? What did you think, Mr. PM? That I'll keep waiting for you the whole day? Listen, I'm not one of those sad types. Chill. - 'These three don't know each other, but still a..' 'In a cinema hall.' Abhi, today is my birthday. Please let things be. Listen, I am sorry. You didn't think of me even a little? Come on. I thought of you a lot. Now enough of this sentimental talks. It's your birthday. I want to make it up to you. Tell me, what do you want? So, I can think of anything? Come on, man. I am the prime minister of this country. Okay. Go for it. 'So, what are you waiting for?' 'Let the story..' - Shah Rukh Khan. What about him? Get him here. Come on, man. I thought you were the prime minister of this country. Who wants Shahrukh.. ..when you are with me. Will you have anything else? - This file is more than enough, sir. It is a huge expose for the media. We will get different types of reaction from everywhere. We will surely get reactions. Now we need to wait and watch how extreme they will be. Oh God. Sir, politics is a strange illness.. No. Mr. Ajay Thakur. I'll keep him on speaker, sir. Hello? Akbar, it's Ajay Thakur. Sir, I, too, save some numbers on my phone. Tell me, Mr. Ajay, what made you think of me? You are a king, Akbar. I always think of you. Hey. Sir, my elders have named me. You shouldn't consider me a king. But you are a kingmaker, right? If I come to the point, the public isn't too happy with the government. Prime minister has only three months to become a Lok Sabha member. Tell him to keep other things aside.. ..and start preparing for the elections. Opposition is instigating from the grass root to the top level. I've received calls some party MPs as well. They say, Mr. Ajay, why don't you become the prime minister? Now you tell me, what should I tell them? Sir, Late Anand Bakshi said it rightly. People talk, it's their job to talk. It was my duty to warn you. Give my regards to your wife. Sure. Give me regards to your family as well. What happened? BP keeps shooting up. I don't like this. I feel sick. Abhi, can't we have this baby right away? Why do we have to wait nine months? That is not possible. But we can do something else. Are you sure, sir? - Yes, uncle. Government won't have to go through labor pains. Ask the cabinet secretary to start making the preparations. Alright, sir. Anything else we need to finish? I think that's it. Best of luck for the UN assembly. Thank you. What is it? Abhi, I hope no problems arise because of this child. Why? We are in the 21st century. A huge percentage of our country is young. They have progressive thinking. They'll understand. And thank you for this. Sir, the youth you trust so much doesn't vote. Bro, what's up? Let me sleep. Sleeping beauty, listen to me carefully. - You remember the U-vote application we once discussed? - Yes. Can we think that application to Aadhar Card? As a verification. Just to avoid duplication, you know. But I need this soon. How soon? - 15 days. You think it's possible? Has anything else been impossible for us? It will be done. Thank you so much, man. I owe you for this. Yeah? Okay. See you. Bye. Argue, Murli. We shot down the idea of Anand Mishra.. ..because we thought Abhimanyu Kaul was a better bet. We made him the PM. But the political incorrect... ...personal and professional life this good boy is leading... I don't think... ...we'll be able to win the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections... ...under his leadership. So? Can't you see? Shubho Da becomes the Honorable President of India. I become the Deputy Prime Minister. Who's next? It makes me very proud that I've been asked to invite.. ..a 28-year-old man representing a 3000-year-old civilization.. To address this esteemed gathering of nations. Please welcome, the Honorable Prime Minister of India.. Mr. Abhimanyu Kaul. Honorable President of assembly.. Honorable Secretary General.. And distinguished delegates.. I don't know where to start from. But what I do know is that today.. ..I will express myself in my nation language. Namaste. This isn't just a greeting in my country. It means my soul pays its respect to the God in you. Today, I stand here representing my country before the world. The country where a farmer before going to his fields... ...is waiting to hear a partridge. Because hearing that is considered auspicious. And somewhere in the city a mother is... ...chatting with her son in New York through Skype. This is how our India is. If I have to explain this to someone other than an Indian... ...than an Indian then I might not be able to. I've always been asked what's my plan for this country. I'll tell you my plans. But before that I'll tell you my dream. The oldest civilization and the youngest country.. It means when 3000 years of knowledge... ... and a desire to soar high come together.. Then nothing is impossible. For wherever I see, I see my country. May there be light, wherever my country goes. I, Abhimanyu Kaul, promise each and every citizen of.. ..sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic of India.. To the farmer whose eyes have dried waiting for the rain.. To the mother who today made her child sleep on an empty stomach.. To that laborer who in spite of working hard all day long... ...couldn't earn a square meal. And to all elders and the youth.. Whether or not I stay the prime minister of this country.. India will find its right place in this world. Because I have complete faith in my Young Hindustan... ...or should I say Youngistan. You are so damn lucky, my dear. I know, aunt. I am. Damn, you've raced ahead. Sir, satellite call. Hello? Gynecologist sold her silence. Ajay Thakur. Where's Anvi? At home. Bring her out. Bring that shameless out. Bring her out. Bring that shameless out. Bring her out. Bring that insolent out. Driver, be careful. Bring her out. Bring that insolent out. Stop this shamelessness. Anvi.. It's okay. Don't take so much stress. Go to Japan for a few days. You're getting late. Perhaps you forgot. You have an appointment at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. And listen, I'm not going anywhere. We'll face this together. Otherwise, what's the point, huh? 'As you can see Prime Minister Abhimanyu Kaul..' '..has left the Rashtrapti Bhavan after handing over his resignation.' 'Our sources have informed us that...' '...the prime minister has also suggested His Excellency..' '..to dissolve the parliament and declare elections.' Where did the brick or the stone come from? And who did it hurt? Mr. Ajay, there are rumors in the political circles that.. After the situation that has arisen by Abhimanyu Kaul's resignation.. ..your candidature for the post of prime minister by ABKP is a given. So, is this something you always wanted? No. It's not so. If this is what I desired then after the demise of Late Mr. Dashrath.. ..I wouldn't have proposed Abhimanyu Kaul's name for prime minister. In politics, your character is your identity. Now if anyone believes in a live-in relationship then he can. But I don't believe in it. A woman holds a certain place in our society. Yes, of course. Good evening, Mr. PM. Uncle. Please come. Sorry, sir. I'm breaking the protocol a little. Today, I want Akbar.. I want us to talk as Akbar and Abhimanyu. Mr. Dashrath used to always say that.. Akbar you are very practical. You should have some trust in people. And I.. I perhaps was very practical. But when he asked you to come here.. When he asked you to serve the country.. Then I understood that trust is very competent. He had a lot of trust on this country and its people. And on you as well. Pardon me, but I see no such thing happening. What is this? You know, Abhimanyu... ...your problem is that you cannot stay at one place for long. Look, you left your house for education. You left Japan and a good job and came here. And now you've also left what you were doing over here. So tell me, just between you and me.. What happened? Why did you quit? I don't have any explanation, uncle. You know what 28-year-old boys do. And you saw what I did. And what I will do now.. You will see that as well. Abhimanyu.. Wake up. It's morning. Wake up, Abhi. Abhi, you have a cabinet meeting to attend. Wake up. I want your support for the flood situation in Bihar. So that help can reach there faster. Sir.. The elections are near. Code of conduct. Code of conduct has been implemented. I didn't get you, Mr. Murli. Sir, the election commission can consider this relief fund.. ..as appeasement to voters and declare it unconstitutional. And that's what he means. Sir.. Above all, you are an acting prime minister. You cannot take any important policy decision. This means I can neither start nor stop.. .. any important government business? Yes. Ma'am. File please. - Yes, sir. This is the final report of a CBI investigation. There's no point for me in discussing this further. CBI will have a press conference on it. Tomorrow morning at 11:00am. Please excuse me. I told you, you will see what I will do. Someone from our party was... ...taking kickbacks in the Jet fighter deal. Hello. Mr. Ajay. Welcome. I apologize for dropping in unannounced, Mr. PM. I should be the one apologizing.. ..to make you come here unannounced. I am sure you are here with some grievance. I am not being called to attend the party meetings. And you don't answer my calls. Sir is upset. Offer him some almond drink. 25th February 1982, Sitapur district, UP. Lok Sabha by-elections. On full scale, the campaigning was going on. That's where I met Mr. Dashrath for the first time. Our party's candidate was a little weak. Someone from outside our party was bound to win. Mr. Dashrath came to me and said.. Ajay, you take care of it. Tell me something, Mr. Ajay. - Yes? Do you watch English movies? - What? There is a film in Hollywood, Spiderman. There's a very famous dialogue in it. "With great power comes great responsibility." I hope you understand what it means. And with great responsibility comes great wisdom. This is my fact. Perhaps I have done everything wrong in the past three months. But I did one thing right. I paid heed to my father and didn't stop the enquiry. I too all the right things in the past three months. I made just one mistake. I kept you safe from the parliament. If I hadn't made that mistake then you would've been doomed. You thought you got rid of all... ...the possible prime minister candidates through me. But I was the one who wanted them to step back. And now I won't step back. Sir, I'm ready to get doomed if I have to. Do have the almond drink before you leave. It's said that almond is cold in nature. Offer it to sir. In 2009, in fighter jet's deal, a scam was suspected. On the orders of former prime minister Mr. Dashrath Kaul.. ..we did an enquiry on it. This enquiry was conducted over the span of three years. Former Defense Minister Mr. Ajay Thakur.. ..was found guilty on five counts out of seven charges. Further details will be made public within a week's time. Thank you. No questions. We have got breaking news from the CBI. A possible candidate for prime minister's post Ajay Thakur.. ..has been accused of taking kickbacks in the jet fighter deal. Right. CBI accused Mr. Ajay Thakur... ...and said that they have concrete evidence. Now we have to wait and watch what steps.. ..the party high command takes in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections. Abhimanyu has what it takes, man. He exposed a person from his own party. But he has already dug a grave for himself. His party will earn a bad name.. ..and he won't be able to win the election. All the big shots of the high command are gone. Good boy has become a bad boy. So, going into the elections, who will lead us? Are you sure? Future prime minister of India. Then.. For tomorrow's meeting I will wear a suit. Yes. Respected members, I welcome all of you. Mr. Dashrath, used to say... ...that you should always move ahead with the best candidate. Mr. Abhimanyu, we all concur that for the forthcoming elections.. ..the prime minister candidate for Akhil Bharatiya Kranti Party is.. You. I accept this responsibility. But I have two requests to make. Yes, tell me. I should be allowed to prepare our party's tickets list. And should without any coalition, aiming for full majority.. ..we should run for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections. Okay. That's good. - But why? Mr. Murli, we all know the pain of running a coalition government. And we cannot make everyone happy. It would rather be better to be the opposition. Sir.. You will be the PM and I'll be the Deputy. But you will still have to work hard. This is why you resigned. 'Sir, how long will it take for this enquiry to become public?' 'Three months, I guess?' A little calculation and a little gamble. Come, now let's fight the elections. So our UP chief will be Mr. Kesarinath. You kept talking about youth. Now we have a 68-year-old UP chief. Mr. Murli, I didn't mean young in age, but in attitude. And Mr. Kesari has both. Attitude and experience. Hello. - Mr. Kesari. Welcome. We were waiting for you. Come. Please have a seat. Hello. Wow. You worked on our manifesto all night long on Free India? Yes, and finally it's done. So tell us. So my first point: We are about to bring bank reforms for youth. And if we talk about revenue, in India only... ... 2.77% population pays income tax. And I believe hat if we bring about such a reform.. ..in which anyone who has been.. ..paying income tax throughout his life.. ..the government will return him 1% p.a of that amount as pension. Because of this the 2.77% figure can increase to 12-15%. And Mr. Murli, this will also benefit the local exchequer a lot. But sir, what about agriculture? The income source of 70% of our population. Everyday around 2500 farmers are giving up farming. Now I would like to call upon Mr. Abhimanyu Kaul. Hello. My name is Abhimanyu Kaul. And today, I came here to tell you something. I met an old farmer on the way. He had 12 sacks of grain on a handcart. When I asked, he said he travels 40 kilometers to Sitapur to sell them. Because the middlemen in the village don't pay him the right price. And waiting for the right price the grains often get rotten. On an average grains worth Rs. 6000 crore.. ..gets rotten in this country every year. And the reason for that is the shortage of warehouses. I don't promise but if you give us an opportunity.. The central government will build 2 warehouses in every district. In which at minimal rent a farmer can store his grains. Now if I talk about my personal life.. Today I would like to clear a few things. Yes, I have a friend whom I love a lot. We stay together and we will surely get married at the right time. If you think that I haven't performed.. ..my duties well then don't vote for me. But do vote. Because that is your right. My father, former prime minister Late Mr. Dashrath Kaul.. ..always used to say that if a dear one is upset.. ..with you then you should just go and hug him. Because in this world there are many who get upset.. But there are very few who cajole them. Before I stop talking, I would just like to say that.. ..no matter what is the result of this Lok Sabha election. Abhimanyu Kaul will always try to link with you. Hail motherland! I love you, my Prime Minister. He has a woman staying with him without getting married. And he says that we should vote. He was talking about progress. Why should we bother about what he does in his house? Shut up. You are just a kid. You don't know anything. He doesn't know but I do. When you have money in your pocket where do you go to have fun? He is at least talking about our betterment. Let the elections get over. We will know. 'I, Abhimanyu Kaul, promise each and every citizen of..' '..sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic of India..' 'That India will find its right place in this world.' 'Because I have complete faith in my Young Hindustan... ...or should I say Youngistan.' Move ahead, Abhimanyu, we're with you. This is just a warm up, the real battle lies ahead. "Are you all ready to live life on your own teams?" "Join us and raise your figure." "Each person is a leader." "Recognize your power." "We are the future of this nation." "Be determined to bring about a change." "We will write a new saga for ourselves." "Youngistan!" "Keep fighting." "Youngistan!" "Don't keep quiet." "Recognize your power." "Youngistan!" "Keep fighting." Sir, what message would you like to convey to youngistan? Because of technology we can get any information that we want. But there is a very thin line between information and knowledge. And I would say figure that line out. I know everything doesn't mean I can do everything. The day everyone understands this, I think we'll become unstoppable. "Tying our shoe laces tight." "We need to walk on our path." "Don't stop fearing a fall." "Today you need to reach the top." "We are not the clouds that are only meant for thundering." "We only shower where the ground seems dirty." "Youngistan!" "Keep fighting." "Youngistan!" "Don't keep quiet." "Recognize your power." "Youngistan!" "Keep fighting." "We don't fear while facing storms." "The fragrance of our country's soil is sweet." "Our flag hoists high." "The ones who are determined.." "The ones who have honest dreams.." "This is our identity." "No one can rule us." "We do everything on our own." "This is our identity." "Throw your hands up in the air!" "Stare into the sun!" "Throw your hands up in the air!" "Stare into the sun!" "Get ready to fight!" "Youngistan! Youngistan!" "Youngistan!" "Keep fighting." "Youngistan!" "Don't keep quiet." "Recognize your power." "Youngistan!" Mr. Abhimanyu Kaul, it's been said.. ..that the position of Prime Minister was an easy access for you. And now you are talking about change. How can you change something that hasn't been possible for ages? The nation wants to know is it a piece of cake for you? I agree it was easy access for me. But even you know that what I want to do is not easy. All these years, youth never got a representative. And thanks to that easy access I have that position.. ..with which I can do something for the country and its youth. And Mr. Anirudh, as far as it being a piece of cake is concerned.. I prefer 'Gulab Jamuns', sir. Anything else? - No. That will be all. Thank you. Clear majority? It's difficult, sir. Uncle, our party is 30 years old. It has its own loyal vote bank. I'm only searching for the 2% swing.. ..that can give us an edge or make us lose. Sir, then that 2% swing is you. Let's hope for the best. Age isn't a factor to run this country, all you need is brains. PM sir, PM sir, what do you have to say? Can you bring a change in the.. ..country dressed in a jeans and jacket? Could I have brought I change if.. ..I was wearing a kurta-pyjama and a cap? I don't wear a cap, neither do I put one on others. We've to bring a change in thoughts, and the day that happens.. ..the country will change, thank you very much. But sir... excuse me. Now we need to wait and watch whether or not Abhimanyu Kaul.. ..can prove true to the expectations of the people. With cameraman Ravi Yadav, this is Karishma Chauhan. News Times, New Delhi. "We don't fear while facing storms." "The fragrance of our country's soil is sweet." "Our flag hoists high." "The ones who are determined.." "The ones who have honest dreams.." "This is our identity." Hello. I am Poonam. Welcome to Your Government. Today's biggest question: Who will form a government in the center? Poonam, the figures are giving us a clear picture. In Haryana and Punjab UDA has a strong lead. The 'Good Boy' tag Abhimanyu Kaul has been given.. And because of his personal life.. It's difficult for people to trust him. They say nonsensical things. Don't listen to them. Parag, we have started getting figures from Rajasthan as well. UDA has a strong lead here as well. Listen.. You've done your best. Akbar uncle, how many seats do we need for majority? For clear majority, 273. You know Abhi, you'll get 288. Why 288? Because 288 is more than 273. I said whatever came to my mind. Abhimanyu is losing. He was bound to lose. I told you, he's digging a grave for himself. After orchestrating Ajay Thakur's expose. Parag, another point is that... ...Abhimanyu Kaul's decision to fight the elections.. ..without forming any coalition might make him pay dearly. And talking about his personal life in front of a crowd in Sitapur.. ..too doesn't seem to be in favor of Abhimanyu. Come on, now let's talk to UDA's senior leader Mr. Kalpesh Mishra. He's joined us in the studio. Mr. Mishra, tell us, what's the reason behind such results? There are a lot reasons. I would like to thank Abhimanyu Kaul's inexperience. And I would like to say a big 'Thank You' to Anvita Chauhan.. ..who is the biggest reason behind this. So Mr. Mishra, should Abhimanyu Kaul take a lesson from this? Abhi.. Don't. Parag, we have started getting figures from Bihar as well. And the news that we are getting.. ..is something we couldn't have guessed some time back. These Lok Sabha elections have set a record. Indian politics has never seen such a change. After trailing behind in many states Abhimanyu Kaul.. ..has started playing the trumpet of his victory from Bihar. According to fresh data, in Bihar in 30 out of 40 seats... ...ABKP has a deciding lead. But Parag, is Abhimanyu Kaul too late for a comeback? But Poonam, the figures from Maharashtra... ...are bringing good news for Abhimanyu. The seats in this region seem to be going in favor of ABKP. It's a battle of equal might. But I'll have to say.. - Vidhya, where were you? Karnataka is gone. How many times do I have to tell you to stay where you are, please? Come, sit. We are getting some important news, Poonam.. ..which is suggesting a drastic change. The votes that were cast for the first time... ...during these elections through e-voting.. The counting of those votes has commenced. And the results are shocking. Because of this the results are changing drastically. Now UDA is on the second position with 175 seats. And ABKP is on the first position with 200 seats. Anvi.. Why are so worried? Abhi, what do you mean by why am I so worried? We need 73 more seats for majority. Wait for UP. Why UP? Dear, that's because in Indian politics.. ..so far no one has been able to understand "Why UP?". Out of 79 seats in UP, ABKP has a great lead on 40. According to the tally, 243 seats seem to be going to ABKP. After the counting of the votes that were cast through e-voting.. ..the image of this election has changed. This proves that the youth segment of this country is... ...joining Abhimanyu Kaul in large numbers. So, what are your thoughts of this amazing comeback of ABKP? I have a lot of thoughts to share. But first of all I would like to thank my friend Mr. Kalpesh. He thanked Anvita Chauhan for such results some time back. The magical figure of 273 is still far away. Abhimanyu Kaul needs 30 seats. Now it will be interesting to see whether this "Good Boy" of India.. ..is able to gain a clear majority? There's a small difference, but it's still a big difficulty. Abhi, tell me something, if you don't get clear majority.. ..you will really not try to form a government? But what? Anvi, then how will be different from others? I tried to bring about a change. And my heart says that people must've voted for that change. News from Sitapur. Abhimanyu Kaul has won by around... ...4.5 lakhs votes in his ancestral seat, Sitapur. He broke his father former prime minister.. ..Late Mr. Dashrath Kaul's last.. ..victory's record by around 1 lakh votes. "Bestower of spiritual treasures.." "Bestower of spiritual treasures.." "Bestower of spiritual treasures.." "Is a grace to the world." "Bestower of spiritual treasures.." "Bestower of spiritual treasures.." "Bestower of spiritual treasures.." "Is a grace to the world." "I am crazy about Almighty." "I am crazy about Almighty." ABKP has crossed the magical figure of 273. Abhimanyu Kaul has alone assured this victory. Looks like India is once again ready for its youngest prime minister. "Pleas are powerful." "For better or worse, we have our fate." "There is a wave in the sea.." - Abhi, you won. "That belongs to you." "There is a wave in the sea that belongs to us." We did. "There is a wave.." Long live, Abhimanyu Kaul! Long live, Abhimanyu Kaul! Abhimanyu Kaul! "Don't stop fearing a fall." "Today you need to reach the top." "We are not the clouds that are only meant for thundering." "We only shower where the ground seems dirty." "Youngistan!" "Keep fighting." "Youngistan!" "Don't keep quiet." "Recognize your power." "Youngistan!" "Keep fighting." Are you Hasarat Kaul's daughter-in-law? "We don't fear while facing storms." "The fragrance of our country's soil is sweet." "Our flag hoists high." "The ones who are determined.." "The ones who have honest dreams.." "This is our identity." "No one can rule us." "We do everything on our own." "This is our identity." "Throw your hands up in the air!" "Stare into the sun!" "Throw your hands up in the air!"
