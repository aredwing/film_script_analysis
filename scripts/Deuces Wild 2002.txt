It was the summer of '58. The year the Dodgers|left Brooklyn. The summer|Dion and the Belmonts... were blasting|out of every car radio... and the summer|that I first fell in love. It was the summer|Marco Vendetti... came home from prison... and the streets of Sunset Park|ran red with blood. My brother Leon started a gang|called the Deuces... after our brother Alley died. Our job|was to protect the block. -Leon.|-Hey, Fritzy. -You need anything?|-I'll let you know, kid. But it was a local mob guy|named Fritzy... who really ran|the neighborhood. He pretended to be|everybody's best friend. Get yourself an ice cream. But he was only in it|for himself. Scooch. Center field. On the corner of Sixth Street|and Second, the Deuces ruled. Hey, Pops.|Grandson gettin' better? He's good. -Hey, what?|-Aw, it's horrible. We hung out at a candy store|called Willie's... where we ran bootleg cigarettes,|illegal fireworks... and did a little bookmaking|on the side. Hey, we had to make a livin'. Aw, come on. They're playin'|like little girls here. What, did he throw it|underhand? Oh, Scooch. We're havin' fun. Ah, the Dodgers lost again. The usual, Scooch. I told 'em. They ain't gonna|win in Los Angeles. They shouldn't have left|Brooklyn. Come on, I never seen 'em cry. The last game,|they wept like a baby. How are you? Go on. Fuck the Dodgers. Fuck Pee Wee, fuck Jackie,|and fuck the fuckin' Duke. Don't say that, Tommy! Don't|say, "Fuck the fuckin' Duke." Hey, listen. Everybody knows|he signed your friggin' glove. Get over it. They left. I ain't rootin' for 'em|no more. 'cause you're|a fair-weather fan. Oh, come on, now.|Let's go outside. Let's go outside now.|I'll see ya later. What's this? Bridesmaid's dress. Pink taffeta.|You like it, huh? You know what I like you in. Who's gettin' married? My cousin Antoinelle,|out in Bayridge. You're comin', right? Another cousin gettin' hitched?|How many more are there? People do get married, Leon. It is somethin' people do,|you know. Willie, is it suddenly|gettin' hot in here or what? Oh, so what do you|want to do tonight? -You know this fuckin' kid?|-Who? -This kid.|-Who's he? Hey, asshole. You know whose turf this is? This is Deuces turf. You fuckin' listenin' to me? Ah, me deaf! Ah, me deaf! -Shut the fuck up!|-I'm deaf! -Leon.|-What? Come here. There's a fight. Fuck! Fuck! What are you doin'? This kid|was disrespectin' our turf. I think he's one of them|Garfield boys or somethin'. This ain't a Garfield boy.|He don't hang with no peewees. This is Betty Ann's little|brother--her deaf brother. Nate. Big guy. Go home. You hit one person a year,|it's a deaf kid. Well, how the fuck|am I supposed to know? His mother should hang a sign|around his neck or some shit. Father Aldo, we're up here. Father. Thanks, bud. You missed a spot. Hey, Father. You wanna|come up here and help me? That's your penance. I hear Marco Vendetti|is comin' home soon. I thought you should know. Give me your word|nothing's gonna get outta hand. Give me some more|of that polish, Scooch. You know the first thing I'm|gonna do when I get outta here? I'm gonna get me|a nice cold beer... a slice of sicilian,|a nice piece of ass... and find that rat motherfucker|who sent me here. I'm gonna slice his|motherfucking throat... from ear to ear. Mark the son of a bitch. Not bad, huh? -It's not bad.|-It looks all right. Who put this on the window? Carnival. Not bad.|It's gonna be a good spot. -A good spot, yeah.|-Make us some money. -Make us some money, yeah.|-Philly Babes. Get away from here. -Where's Leon?|-What's it to ya? He told Mikey Festo|he was gonna break his head... if he rented out|the store over here. -So?|-Let me ask you somethin'. Since when|did he become the landlord? Since yesterday.|You didn't read the paper? Tell your brother|we're movin' in over here. You or any of your guys... try to stop any of my guys,|and you're dead. Over my dead body are you gonna|move junk into this building. Whoa.|Who said anything about junk? We're talkin' about|a little numbers action... some broads, Mario Lanza|on the jukebox. Relax. Don't tell me to relax,|you son of a bitch. Watch your mouth,|you little prick. Come on. Go hang out|with the other girls. There ya go, ya punks. They're runnin'. Squeal, pig! How do you like them apples,|fat ass? You boys all right? Do I look like|I'm all right, you moron? Get me outta here. Help me get this guy|outta here. Hey, Bobby.|Let's get outta here. Beautiful. It smells good in here, mom. It's comin' from next door. Well, what are we|supposed to eat? I started to make|the cacciatore. You know, it was|my Alley's favorite. The onion made me cry. What about makin'|my favorite, ma? It's a dish called food. I'm fuckin' starving. Watch that mouth! What you talk like that|to me for? -Hey, ma. What's goin' on?|-Nothin'. No dinner. If you would take the money|we give you... and spend it on food|instead of fuckin' booze... we would have|some fuckin' supper! No! You gotta buy food! Hey! You're talkin'|to your mother like that! Get outside. Now! I can't take it anymore. Don't worry, ma. I'm gonna go to the corner.|I'll get somethin' to eat. What? What's the matter|with you, huh? There's been a truce|on this block for three years. Did I tell you to break it? They were disrespectin' you.|What am I supposed to do? Droppin' bricks off the roof?|What are you, fuckin' crazy? Cinder blocks--they're bigger. Oh, it's just a game to you,|huh, Bobby? I gotta answer to Fritzy|for this. One of those guys might die. What's Fritzy|got to do with this? Nobody moves in Sunset Park|without his OK. You know that. So you're just gonna let 'em|move in? You lost your fuckin' balls|or somethin'? You don't run the Deuces,|I do. And I don't back down|from nothin'. There will be no junk|on this block, ever. Now, we're gonna do it my way. If I ever hear you talk to|our mother again like that... I swear to God, I will crack|your fuckin' head open. Hey, I'm here to see Fritzy. Thanks. Get this kid|somethin' to drink. What do you want,|a soda or somethin'? No, thanks. You know... bricks don't fall|out of the sky... in this neighborhood|unless I'm throwin' 'em. You understand? Yeah, Fritzy. Now, Philly Babes|is one thing... but his car? That really got me angry. What the fuck|is wrong with you? I'm gettin' calls|from Mikey Festo. Who are you|to strong-arm anyone? There's no disrespect to you,|Fritzy. He's gonna rent the store|to Philly and his crew. They're gonna deal junk|out of there. If I ever hear that word out of|your mouth again in my club... that'll be your last word. This ain't your block. We all know what happened|to your brother Sal. -I'm sorry for your...|-Alley. What? His name was Alfonse Michael.|We called him Alley Boy. Alley Boy. We're all sorry|for your loss... but he was a little junkie,|wasn't he? Wasn't he? Yes or no. Look... Mikey Festo|doesn't own that store. I do... and I'm gonna do|whatever I want with it. So mind your own business. Wear your jacket,|sing your songs... do whatever the fuck it is|that you kids do. Just stay out of my way. Alley Boy. You movin' in? That's smart.|You're a clever boy. Where'd you live before? President Street. Yeah? Always there? Before that, I crawled out|from between my mother's legs. You got any more questions? What, are you just gonna|stand there... or are you gonna help me? That's Vipers territory.|I'm a Deuce. -Douche?|-That's--that's funny. Come on.|It's just a line in the street. Not to me. I'm sorry. You're a real Prince Charming,|you know? Give me that. Here. It's heavy. Thanks. Hey, Bobby, come here. I'm talkin'. Get up here, now. Hey, Annie. She's nice, right? The little fox|with the ponytail? They ain't foxes.|They're the Velvets. Do you know|who I was just talkin' to? Yeah. That's Annie--|Annie the ice cube. What do you know about her? She's Jimmy Pockets' sister.|That says it all. What? They're related? See, I told you we should have|killed that bastard. You stay away from her.|We got enough trouble. Hey, I just saw you|out the window. What the hell you talkin'|to that Deuce for, huh? None of your business. Look, everything in my house|is my business. Could you give me a hand|with these boxes? They're kinda heavy, you know. You're such a helpful brother,|Jimmy. Hey, I let you live|in my house, right? You wanna live on the streets,|that's fine with me. I catch you talkin'|to that Deuce again... you're outta here. Take that crazy mother of yours|with ya. She's your mother, too, Jimmy. Come on. Ma, come on. Ma,|what are you doin'? Please. I'm sorry, OK? A pepperoni pie. Table 4a. -You're terrible.|-I am terrible. I'm starvin', though, too. I don't know. She's hot. She couldn't be|as hot as this pizza. What do you got,|the red line to hell in there? Is it the same one again? -Hi.|-How are you? That's terrible! She looks like... -Do I have dough on my face?|-No, you're good. Oh, my God. You can't go crazy, right? You again? Are you here|to take our orders? Yeah, what do you want? I want you to take it|on the arches. What? Get outta sight. Scram.|You know, disappear? So listen, um...Annie. How'd you know my name? I know a lot of things. So, anyway,|I was wondering... What were you wondering,|wonder boy? Are you going to the feast|on Friday night? Who's asking? Well, I mean, I'm probably|gonna be there, so... -Where's our pizza?|-I don't know. Have they cooked it?|I mean, I'm dying. You're still here? Why is he still here? All right. Hey, I think he's cute. He's all right. So how'd you do? She likes me. I'm here to see Marco Vendetti. Right over there. -What the fuck happened to you?|-The Deuces. The punks ambushed me when|I was checkin' out the club. I'm lookin' over my shoulder|everywhere I go now... paranoid as a fuck. I got a limp that's gonna be|with me the rest of my life. There goes your dancing career. -Yeah, that's funny.|-No, it's not. You're an embarrassment. If you weren't my cousin,|I'd break your other arm. I'm sorry. You'd better get that club,|Philly. I got big plans for that spot. It'll be ready. I promise. All right. Don't mess this up. Get me a sit-down with Fritzy.|Tell him Marco wants to see him. Why? Just shut up and do what I say. Look at you.|You're fuckin' pathetic. Come on, Vendetti.|Time's up. Tell the Vipers to crush|them fuckin' Deuces, all right? We gotta answer for this. Yeah, nice to see you, too. You know what I'd do to her,|Dommy? You'd boff her, Jack? Yeah. You know how good, Dommy? Really good, Jack. -Where do these girls live?|-France. France. Where's that? I think you take the "F" train. The "F" train. Oh, good God. They got Elvis.|Goddamn, what's next? Yeah, I got more peachfuzz|on my balls... than he's got on his head. I wouldn't shave my head|if they attacked my bedroom. Looks like my gym teacher. -Hey, how's it goin'?|-Got any deliveries? Well, gimme a box. -Dad, get me a pretzel.|-Oh, shut up. You're like your mother.|Always got your hand out. Money don't grow on trees.|How much? -Twenty cents.|-Daddy, please. When I tell you to shut up,|you shut up. Leave him alone. Hey, do yourself a favor and|mind your own fucking business. This is my kid.|I do with him what I want. That's because of you. Leon, stop! It's OK!|It didn't hurt! Don't touch him again.|He's a good boy. Get outta here. -Bunch of punks.|-Get outta here! You want a pretzel?|Come here. A little mustard|on the pretzel? All right.|You go home to your mother. Thanks, Leon. Oh, my God. Come on. Come on. Come on. Guys! Holy shit. There must be|fifteen of 'em over there. I never knew|they had so many guys. All right. Fuck this shit! Unh! You crazy? Come on! Get outta here!|Get off the street! I guess|we're goin' to war, huh? Well, that's what happens when|you all do somethin' stupid. Well, maybe|it's for Marco's homecoming. Look, it don't make|any fuckin' difference. You gotta listen to what|I'm tellin' you--no fightin'. Yeah, just chicken out, right? Aw, come on.|What do I look like, Leon? I say we beat|their fuckin' brains out. What, are you deaf?|What did I just say? Leon, they challenged us. Why are you goin' soft on me? Watch it, Bobby. All right. You know what? You guys wanna be pansies,|that's fine... but I'm gonna have|no part of it. I need a little time to think. Go to the feast.|Just stay cool. That's all I'm askin'. Hey, I hear the Vipers|are gunnin' for you. Yeah, so what else is new? You want my guys ready? I mean,|in case you come up short. I'm just here for the babes,|Freddie. Oh, right. The babes.|Well, look... we're there for you|if you need us, OK? The word is you'll need us. They got an army, you know? -See ya, chief.|-Yeah, see ya. You got some change? Thanks. Place your bets.|Place your bets. Hey, feelin' lucky? Oh, fancy meeting you here. So, what number|you gonna put your money on? Fifteen. You must be feeling lucky. That's 100-to-1 shot. I always go for the long shot. Hi, handsome. You sure you don't wanna go|to the feast, Leon, huh? I been to that feast|twenty times already. What am I gonna win,|another kewpie doll? I got me a kewpie doll. Come here. You like me, don't you? Well, I feel sorry for ya. There's a difference. Yeah, that's why you were|up all night screamin' my name. I must have been|havin' a nightmare. Talk about a nightmare, livin'|in that house with your brother. You don't know the half of it. You know, he labels the milk|so no one else can drink it... and then he spends|the whole day in the bathroom... shootin' skag|and drinkin' beer... and then he thinks|drinkin' a glass of milk... is gonna keep him healthy? He's crazier than my mother. You think that's crazy,|you should see my house. Hello, Jack.|Hey, where you goin'? Hey, Jackie. Hey, don't touch me. Please don't touch me.|Please stop. Please. We just wanna talk to you. Hey, put 'em up! Put his arm out! Come on! Oh! We got a winner, huh? Which one you want,|little lady? Uh, that one. -This one?|-Yeah. -There you go.|-Thanks. They jumped Little Jack! -Hey, somebody get the guys!|-Somebody get some help! Jack, you OK? Hey, Bobby. Bobby, man,|they jumped Little Jack. They jumped him, man. -Take it easy.|-He's all right. The Vipers jumped me|in the park. Oh, I'm gonna kill 'em! All right. Cool it. Cool it.|We gotta get Leon. Hey, Scooch, you know where|Betsy's baby-sittin'? Go tell Leon it's going down|in the park. Go! Bobby, man,|you want my guys now? Yeah, all you can bring. All right, man. You can|count on us. We'll be there. Let's get these motherfuckers! -They jumped Little Jack.|-Call an ambulance. -Guys, come on!|-No more fightin', Bobby! I'm sorry. I didn't do anything wrong. I'll get it. I'll get it. -Leon.|-What's wrong? The Vipers jumped Little Jack.|Come on, hurry up. -Where?|-The park. Hey, where's Freddie? He's dead if he don't show. No way, Moof, not us. -Let's do it.|-Let's fuckin' do it. You gotta be kiddin' me. Little Bobby.|Where's your brother? Don't worry, he'll be here,|you fuckin' grease monkey. He ain't comin', fuck-putz.|What do you got, huh? Look at him. He's a punk. Come on! Motherfucker! Get him off me! Motherfucker! It's over. It's fuckin' over. Gotta run! Let's get the fuck out of here! Bobby, are you all right? Can you get up? Give me a minute. Is he gonna be OK? Come on! We still got|more coming! Let's go! Bobby, what happened, man?|It started already? What are you talkin' about?|It's already over. Man, you guys|are somethin' else. Where the hell were you? The Bulls! Scatter! Let's scatter! Alley? Alley Boy? It's Leon, ma. It's Leon. Go get him. It's OK, ma. It's OK. Oh, God. God, that hurts. Stop fidgeting, wonder boy. Stop being such a baby. There we go. Is that Christmas music I hear? What the hell?|It's, like, 115 degrees. My mom has a thing for|Christmas music, that's all. Don't pay no attention to it. What has Leon told you|about me, anyway? What'd he say? -Nothin'.|-Nothin'? I bet he told you|I was a slut, right? No, nothin' like that. He just said you were cool. That's the trouble with guys.|They lie. Big fat fuckin' lyin' mouths. We wish you a merry Christmas Hey, you want to see something? What? Come with me. Where you goin'? Just follow me. You know, you don't have|to be embarrassed. Embarrassed about what? About your mother. Mine's no prize. You shouldn't say that... 'cause she's your mother. You always gotta|take care of her. Yeah, but it's gotta go|both ways, too. She doesn't give a shit|about me. What was your brother like? He was kind of a dreamy kid,|you know? He started out,|he just had a little habit. But then he got strung out. Leon went to Marco and Jimmy... and said,|"Stop givin' my brother junk." But they kept--|they kept giving it to him... so he beat the hell|out of 'em... and then one day, they--they--|they gave him a hot shot. They killed him. I'm sorry. I didn't know that. Now you do. Hey, Bobby, you know what? What? I love my bear. -Yeah?|-Yeah, I do. Leon, listen to me. Little Jack|was in the hospital all night. Put an end to this|before somebody gets killed. What do you want me to do,|Father? You were fightin', too. I want you to talk to the boys. They listen to you.|I want you to make peace. I don't know. I think you're|talkin' to the wrong guy. Look out for the whale, man! Deuces rule! -Hey, Little Jack.|-My boys. -Welcome back.|-Look who it is. -How'd it go?|-Hey, we threw 'em a bing. We ain't gonna be seein'|no Vipers for a while, trust me. How you feelin'? A lot better than I look,|I hope. Hey, thanks for stickin' up|for me last night. Don't mention it. -We're Deuces, right?|-Right. Hey, Jack, go put your feet up. Hey, it's hot out here. Best-looking guy out here. Hey, who's that broad|from last night? That's Annie,|Jimmy Pockets' sister. What's he doing over there|with the enemy? What do you think he's doing? Hey, Marco. Welcome home. What's the matter? You know how long|I been waitin' here? I don't know. Fifteen minutes? I've been waitin' three years|and fifteen minutes. Get the fuck in the car. Right. Here's your beer. You take care of them Deuces? Yeah, we fought 'em. You gonna tell me what happened,|or I gotta read your mind? It went down just like you said. We were destroying them,|and then out of nowhere... Leon shows up,|and then it gets bad. You're tellin' me one guy|took on our whole crew? Yeah. He went crazy. Shut up. Goddamn, do I gotta|do everything myself? -Where is he?|-How should I know? Ask Father Aldo.|He's gonna make him a saint. Jesus don't listen|to no snitches. From now on,|I want you to tell me... every fuckin' move he makes,|you understand me? It's good to see you, Marco. Oh, there he is. The cavalry|and his lovely tomato. -Great last night, Leon.|-Like the old days. Hey, guys, don't egg him on,|all right? -How you feelin'?|-Like a million dollars. Leon, you gotta teach me|how to fight like you. What are you talkin' about,|Scooch? You're gonna be the new|center fielder for the Dodgers. You're takin'|Duke Snider's spot. Come on. Come here! Don't go. -He's callin' me.|-What are you, a dog? -No.|-Then let him come here. What if he has something|important to tell me? Well, you can let him|tell you here. -Bobby!|-What? Bobby, what's wrong with you? Go on to your brother,|puppy dog. I'll be right back.|Don't go nowhere. What'd I do this time? I wanted to tell you you did|the right thing last night. I did? Yeah, they jumped Little Jack.|What were you supposed to do? -You mean you're not mad?|-I ain't mad. You didn't shoot anybody.|I'm fuckin' thrilled. All right.|Can I enjoy my day now? Oh, hey, welcome home, Marco. I fixed up the house|like you said. -Good.|-Ohh. The neck, man. The neck. Don't worry. They'll be swimmin'|in their own blood in no time. Hey, get the drapes. Hey, welcome home, daddy-o.|How you doin'? -Good. How'd you get that?|-Fuckin' Deuces. How's my good friend Leon|doing? Dead,|when I get my hands on him. You know how I can get to him? Yeah, you remember|that little kid Scooch? -What the fuck's a Scooch?|-That drunk asshole Gino's kid. Leon's like a father|to that little mutt. -Good shot.|-Good to see you. Come here. Do me a favor.|Get me a bicycle. -What for?|-Just do what I say. What are we gonna|tell everybody, huh? Tell 'em I fell off a ladder|in church. Well, at least your eye|matches your suit. You really want to go|to this thing? Yeah, Leon, come on. All right. Let's go. Hey, Scooch. Nice bike. -Yeah, you like the bike?|-Yeah. Yeah, it looks good on you. -Scooch, get over here.|-Stay right there. Why don't you come over here|and get him? Well, come on, then. Let's see|what happens, motherfucker. Stop! What are you doin'? I'm gonna cut you a thousand|times, you know that? One for every day you left me|in that fuckin' cage. You come by my block again,|and I'll fucking kill you! This ain't your block no more. Just get off me! It's good to see you, Leon. Why didn't you say good-bye|to me at the pool? -You was busy.|-No, I wasn't. Well, if you wasn't busy,|then why didn't you come... and say good-bye to me? Can we talk about this outside,|please? I'll see you later. Are you ever gonna grow up,|or are you just gonna spend... the rest of your life|in Leon's shadow? Hey, I ain't|in no one's shadow. Really? Look, let's get|something straight. If you want to be with me,|then be with me. I want to be with you. Well, you sure don't|act like it, you know? Stop bein' ashamed of me,|especially in front of Leon. You gotta take my hand. You gotta put your arm|around my shoulder, you know? Boyfriend-girlfriend stuff. Well, let's make it real. -You mean it?|-I'm serious as a heart attack. You really want me|to be your girl? Yeah. Right now. What would you do|if I was your girl? Well... I would hug you... and I would kiss you... and then I would climb|the empire state building... and tell the whole world|that you were my girl. I would say, "Everybody,|Annie is my girl now!" Marco. My cousin Philly|said you had something... you wanted to talk to me about. Heroin.|I got an unlimited supply. What are you, fuckin' stupid? You know|I don't deal that stuff. You don't have to. I'll do|all the dirty work myself. What's in it for me? You front me the cash,|I'll triple your money. I'll think about it... but if this comes back to me|in any way, I don't know you. That's why we're not having|this conversation. There's just one more thing.|There's these Deuces. This fuckin' kid Leon. I want your permission|to take him out. Whoa, whoa. Slow down. You just got out of jail. Besides, I don't want him|to get killed on my block... you understand? It's bad for business. You don't know who I am,|do you, mister? I don't care who you are,|sonny. The lady said|she didn't want to go. It's lucky for you|you're not packin' a gun. You could've at least said|something to her at the pool. Like what? Congratulations? Welcome to the family? She ain't a Viper, Leon. She didn't even go|to Marco's welcome home party. As a matter of fact, she took|care of me after the rumble. She took care of me good. She's Jimmy Pockets' sister.|End of story. It's not the end of the story! Her family killed your brother. You remember that? Yeah, well you can't fuckin'|stop me from seein' her! Oh, yeah?|What are you gonna do? I'll do whatever the fuck|I want to do! -You're not my father, Leon!|-You want out, Bobby? -What are you talkin' about?|-You want out of the gang? 'Cause that's what|you're askin' for. Leon, I am always behind you. You want me to cut|Jimmy Pockets... into a million pieces?|I'll do it. You want me to kill|fuckin' Marco? I'll do it. But Annie's my girl now... and you're just gonna|have to accept that. Listen up. Some things are gonna change|around here. No more nickel-and-dime|bullshit on the corner. Anybody wants to get high|in Brooklyn... they're gonna come|to the avenue first. We're gonna need runners,|lookouts, baggers-- I'm the fuckin' taste-tester. Ain't nobody gonna stop us now. No crooks, no cops,|and no motherfuckin' Deuces. Am I wrong, Willy?|I mean, tell me. The kid's ridin' a Trojan horse.|I don't trust her. Love. Somethin' I just can't explain. You just gotta let it--|let it take its course. It's his life. Salud. You all right? Punk. I gotta go out there. Don't be stupid. Listen, man,|we gotta do something. I mean, if they smell|blood, weakness... they're gonna hit us harder. And if it's not the Vipers,|it's gonna be somebody else. We gotta show ourselves. That's my opinion.|It's your gang. What do you want to do? I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. What is Bobby doing? Hey, you just gotta|give him some space... learn to trust him. I don't trust her. There's something|about the ocean. What about it? I don't know. It relaxes me. It makes me feel|like I belong here. You do--with me. Hmm. I think the move|is to get out of here. -We just got here.|-No, I mean Brooklyn. I've been thinking about it|a lot, you know... especially after|what happened to the block. Where you gonna go? I don't know. Someplace nice... where it don't snow. Where you can lie on the beach|like this all year-round... where the air don't stink. Like Miami, maybe. How do you know the air|don't stink in Miami? 'Cause I seen pictures. How can you tell|what a place smells like... by looking at pictures? You can just tell, that's all. I'd go to Los Angeles. Why Los Angeles? See the Dodgers. I wonder|what those guys are doing. Pee Wee, Koufax, the Duke. I wonder if they miss Brooklyn. I won't miss it. I'm getting the hell|out of Brooklyn. Well, you're not going anywhere|without me. You serious?|You'd come with me? Today, if you want. Leon would never let you go. -Stop it! Put him down!|-What are you doing? -Shut up!|-Let him--let him fucking go! Stop! Where's your brother now,|Bobby, huh? Leave him alone,|you pieces of shit!

Hey, Leon, Fritzy warned you. You shoulda listened, kid. Mom! Oh, my God. My God! No! Today we say good-bye|to Leon Anthony. May he never be forgotten... neither in God's eyes|nor our own. Amen. There were a lot of funerals|in Sunset Park that week-- Marco, Jimmy Pockets... and of course my brother Leon. It seemed the war between|the Deuces and Vipers... was finally over. Love you. Unfortunately, my mother|paid the highest price. She lost two sons. We decided|it was best for her... to go live with my uncle|on Long Island. She'll be better off with|someone to take care of her. I'm gonna come visit you|out there, Bobby. Maybe we'll go look|at a Dodgers game or somethin'. Yeah, we'll do that. I hear there's a lot of|nice-lookin' broads out there. Maybe you could|send us a couple, huh? Hey, don't forget about us|out there. Deuces forever, right? That's right. Take care, Bobby. All right, Bobby. See you later. That day was the last time... we were all together|as the Deuces. Eventually street gangs... disappeared|from the neighborhood. Life in Sunset Park|would never be the same. Listen... give this to Father Aldo. He'll know what to do with it. Go on. Here. I want you to use it. The Duke signed it. Thanks. Take care of the block,|all right, kid? You're gonna come back, right? Of course I'm gonna come back. You be good. Don't cry. Annie and l, we were going out|to Los Angeles... to start a new life together... and we were takin' her mother|with us. Oh, yeah. There was one more|thing I forgot to mention. What do you feel like eating? Lasagna. With who? Let's go to Ricardo's. Excellent. There was no way I was gonna|let my brother die in vain. Like Leon said, "There will be|no junk on this block, ever."
