You're an attorney, and you have a daughter. How can I come here? Yeah. They have a different set of values here, different morals. We cannot understand that. What does that mean? It is their way. Their family sells them, and they go willingly... because it takes a sacrifice, a need to survive. It's gone on for ages... long before we got here. They have a lot of prostitutes in this region, and who do you think they cater to? Tourists? They got 5-year-olds negotiating blowjobs in a back alley. You call them prostitutes? You see the girl?

Go. He -- he's a trafficker. Yeah, I know. So... Why, you lonely in the nights? It's a personal thing. There's crime, and there's crime. These people already have a reservation for hell. They care about nothing. Your life...maybe $5. And I will miss you. Okay. But you take Thom with you. Just in case. You no look there. I look where I want. You go city? Yes. I come. - No. I go bus Phnom Penh. Mother wait. Oh, come on here. Hmm? Come on. I go Phnom Penh. Phnom Penh? I go Phnom Penh! Go home. I want to take her back with me. And I have money. She dead. What do you mean, she's dead? Huh? I-I don't -- I don't understand. What do you mean, she's dead? Dead. Kaput. Understand? Boom. No boom boom. You know? Wait a minute. Wait a second. Next time I see you, you die. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Hi! Hi, hi! Excuse me. I deserve to be slapped by a couple people, but I don't think you're one of them. And so you know, I'm not one of your perverts, either. So, what were you going to do if you found her in time? I don't know. I didn't get that far. Buy her, I guess. What did I do now? Patrick, I don't want to offend you. But when you buy a girl, you're supporting the trade. You encourage them to keep on going. You become a part of the operation. So, what was I supposed to do, just leave her there? There are over 30,000 child prostitutes in Cambodia. Uh-huh. Let's say we're gonna buy every single one of them. What do you think will happen? I don't know. Next year, there will be 60,000, And their price will be higher. Well, I wasn't trying to help 60,000 girls. I was trying to help one. First time I came here, I was just a volunteer. I thought it would be cool, you know? Different experience. I met Jonathan, and I guess... I was mesmerized by him, so I decided to stay... For love. Anyhow, after the love was gone... I realized I've become too involved, too connected. Seeing the people here, how they're able to smile after all they've been through... I don't know many people who can turn their backs on that. What about you? How long have you been here? Uh... Well, I came to Southeast Asia... a couple years out of school and started working... a bunch of different jobs. Still here. I see. You're some kind of a spec trade or something? No, no, no, no, no. I didn't sign up for all that. I don't understand. I mean, what do you do? What do you live for? I don't know. What's anyone here live for? Just trying to survive. It was very nice talking to you. Come visit us sometime. Hey. Hey! Where did you get that? Yeah, yeah, that. Where did you get that? Girl gave me. Hold on, hold on, hold on. This girl? - Yeah, yeah! Is this girl. This girl? This girl. Boat Batdambang. No, this -- this girl is dead. One month ago. See Batdambang boat, one month. Hey, hey. Uh, how much? Yeah, how much? No, me like. Yeah, I like it, too. How much? Vietnamese? - Yeah. Batdambang is not many. We find her easy. We go other? Yeah, brothels. I go in. Pretend. Uh-huh. I'll pay. You stay in the car. All right. Listen, what if she's not in one of the brothels? You understand? Not -- not a prostitute. She's not a prostitute. Then we go to the street kids. All right. But... no many Vietnamese girl. Yeah. Can I see? You can follow her. It's okay. All right. You wait here. Okay. Holly, hey. How are you? It's Patrick. Short time, $5. We go hotel, $20. What?

Shoeshine, mister? Shoeshine, mister? No. It's okay. All right, come on. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. Oh, yeah. That's good. Okay. Come on. - Ma angry! Ma kill you! I need go back! You're not going back there ever again. Do you understand? What you think... ...we do? What do you want to do? I want to go village right now. You still love your parents? Yes. Even after what they did to you? They no money food. Mother all work hard. Father sick. He many drink. I rich. I give them money. They no sell sister. You're a good person. Why don't you try and get some sleep? Hmm? Come. All right, all right. All right, all right. All right, all right. All right, all right. Now... Come here. "I don't sleep with little girls, you sick fuck." No! N-no fight! No good! Hypocrite. Import/export -- leave a message. Hey, Freddie, it's me. Listen, I'm sorry about that, uh, shipment. I had something come up. I actually want to talk to you about it, and I need to come by and pick up my money. Uh... why don't you give me a call? I'm staying -- I'll just -- you know what? I-I'll call you back. I'll try you back later. C-come. Sit. What's up? I love you. What? We go village. Take sister. Go America. I wife you. No. You -- you can't wife me. You're, like, 12 years old, all right? You're a little kid. I woman. I many men. I can wife you. Okay, uh... Why don't you go sit over there for now? Go on. Go sit over there. I mean it. You no love me? No, it's -- Okay, let's, uh -- let's just slow that down there. You other girl. I kill her. No, nobody's gonna kill anybody. Sit -- - I kill you! I love you! You no other girl! I jealous you! You don't need to be jealous. W-where you go? I'm just -- I got to -- I got to do some things. I'll be back. I don't know. Try to get some sleep or watch TV. Do whatever you want, okay? Tomorrow... we're gonna figure out what to do. Thank you. All right, come on. We no go Vietnam? Yeah, we're going. It's, uh -- it's just not that easy to get across the border. I think these people can help. Come on. Hi. Hello. Can I help you? Marie? I really like your hair. You hungry? Why don't you go with Wen? She'll get your breakfast. Patrick come, too. No. Patrick and me need to talk about how to help you. Okay? Go. Come. They are smuggled in. The village where you found her is run by the Vietnamese Mafia. So...how do I get her back home? If you try and take her back, they will arrest her for illegal immigration. Probably arrest you, as well. What if I took her back to the States? You can't. They've put a ban on adoption from this region in fear that people will use it as a shield for trafficking. But even if you could, you really think that you can take care of her? I promised her that I would try to help save her sister. You don't even know if you saved her yet. What do you mean? It takes five minutes to rescue a girl from a brothel, but it takes five years to reintegrate her into society and save her. Listen, I appreciate what you did. I do. But if you really did it for her, you have to let it go. So, I just dump her here, and that's it? That's the happy ending? As long as it's not tragic, it's happy. Can I come visit her, see how she's doing? She's 12 years old, and her male perspective is of one who abuses, rapes, and enslaves her. Here, we try and make this girl forget all this. You're always gonna be a part of this world. It's not good for her. And quite frankly, I don't think it's good for you, either. Everything is fine now. You are safe. Can I take this? Where Patrick? You know where you are, Holly? In this place, we try to help little kids like you, kids who have been to very bad places instead of going to school, playing with their friends. You understand? You're very lucky. They're about to start a dance class. Do you like dancing? Holly? Holly. Why are you not in your room, sleeping, like everybody else? I wait Patrick. Holly... ...Patrick is not coming back. So, you know? Yeah, I know. How bad? Well, a couple local mob guys came to my office today. What are you thinking, man? Are you stupid? It was the right thing to do, Freddie. Right thing to do. Yeah, well... See that river there, the Mekong? How many fucking millions of bodies been rolling down that. "The right thing to do." You'd have been laying in that thing if it wasn't for me. Where's the girl? No, she's gone. They're not gonna buy that. I don't care. She's gone. Here. What's this? - Take it. It's a one-way ticket to America. I can't go back there, Freddie. You know that. You don't have a fucking choice. Been 15 years, buddy. Nobody remembers anything. Get the fuck home. Look, I gave them what I owed you, and I paid for the rest. You're heading out tomorrow. You're finished here. I'm not going back. They're gonna kill you, Patrick, okay? For once in your life, you got lucky. Take advantage of it. Yeah. I appreciate the thought. Yeah. Will you do me a favor? Just tell me why. Look, I know how it works, all right? I walk by a hundred kids a day -- grabbing for hand-outs, fucking pushing bullshit souvenirs. Okay? And I know you can't help them. You can't even try. You give them money, someone takes it. You teach them to beg. How many bullshit souvenirs does one guy need, anyway? Then you develop this glazed-eye stare. You know, you walk straight. You don't look at them. And you never stop. And then you're fine. Long as you don't look in their eyes, you're fine. What the fuck does that have to do with anything? I stopped, Freddie. It was just an accident, but I stopped. And I looked into her eyes. You can't stop, Patrick. Got to keep moving. Otherwise, life moves right by. You know, it's time. You've been here too long. These ain't your people. Just go back to America. If you're so worried about little Vietnamese girls, write your Congressman. How you have photo? You go Batdambang? Yeah, Batdambang. You know this girl? I have her first. She good.
