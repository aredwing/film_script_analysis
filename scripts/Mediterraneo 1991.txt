(HENRY LABORIT) MEDITERRANEO They send us on a mission on Mighisti, a lost Aegean isle... the smallest and most distant one. lts strategic importance was zero. Our orders were to observe and make contact. We were to occupy and report. The men assigned to me came from... here and there. Survivors from lost battles... men from disbanded regiments. A platoon ofmisfits like myself, who had happened to survive. Eliseo Strazzabosco, the mule-driver was a strange guy. He'd spent the whole war with his Silvana. He'd brought her from home. He loved herlike a person. Maybe even more. Hey, Strazzabosco! Sweet grapes, eh? A honeymoon in the Aegean. I think tonight... Pretend you didn't hear. Don't give them the satisfaction. There were the Munaron brothers, Libero and Felice. Two mountain boys who had never seen the sea. And there were Lo Russo and Colasanti. You got anything to drink? Lo Russo ha reached de rank of Sergeant Majorin the African Campaign. What might he have become by the war's end? Colasanti, the signalman... Lived in Lo Russo's shadow practically in symbiosis. Then there was Corrado... Noventa, the deserter. He'd already escaped a few times, trying to get home. His wife was pregnant. Last time they caught him... between Albania and Yugoslavia, trying to walk home to ltaly. My attendant, Antonio Farina, was very devoted to me... always ready for orders, at times even anticipating my thoughts. -How much Ionger, Lieutenant? -Not much. -Will there be shooting? -Let's hope not. We were all at the age where one hasn't decided whether... to start a family or lose oneself in the world. Lieutenant, how Iong do we have to stay here? Four months. Damn! Silvana, don't make a fuss. Don't make me look bad to the Sergeant. Calm down, relax! Munaron! Give me the radio! Watch out for the radio! Lieutenant, do we wear the gas masks now? -Nonsense! -Why'd we bring all this stuff? Lieutenant, what's written there? -Greece is the tomb "ton ltallon". -What does "ton ltallon" mean? All right, men. We'll all advance very quietly inland. Keep your eyes open. Strazza, at the rear. Colasanti, in the middle to... make sure the radio is safe. Once on top, we'll establish a base. Understood? Yes, but what does "ton ltallon" mean? "Of ltalians." -What? -"Greece is the tomb of ltalians." There's nobody here. -Your head's burning. You're hot, eh? -Hell! No objections? I'll go in. This time we agree? Not a fucking soul! There's nobody in this town. Are you crazy? Didn't you see me? I'm Farina. Excuse-me! You almost killed me! -We heard a shot, so we fired. -Who the hell fired? -Farina did, Lieutenant! -We saw him fire. -He shot, so we fired. -Wait! Lieutenant, I saw the hoIe thing. Farina got attacked by a chicken and reacted. The men, taken by surprise... thought we were being attacked by Greek chickens. Let's not kid around. You could have killed him! -It was no big Ioss... -Stop joking. I was onIy joking. I meant better a dead chicken than... It was just to keep up the morale of the troops. You're a bunch of idiots! One doesn't smoke on guard duty. Fuck off, Strazzabosco! If they spot your cigarette, they can shoot you in the forehead. What are you smoking? Milit. Give me a drag. I gave you a scare, huh? -What's happening? -Did you hear? Look! Alarm! -Who the hell yelled? -Farina gave the alarm. Look there. We're kicking their asses, eh? Lieutenant, our side is really beating them! Lieutenant, I hear something but it's mostly static. Here, Lieutenant. -What do they say? -Wait. What about our man? Where are they? Wait, I don't understand. -It's the British. -They're speaking English. Lieutenant, tell us, too. -What about us? -I don' know! You don't know! -What'll do know? -Boy, I don't know. I understand. Everyone in position! Maximum alert! Stay alert and don't move. The Brits... could land any minute. Understood? Stop, who's there? It's me, Lo Russo. -Password. -It's me, I said. -ldentify yourself. Password? -I told you, it's me, Lo Russo. The password, or we shoot. AII right... "Savoy or death". O.K., Sergeant, you may come closer. O.K., my ass! Counter password? "Memento audere semper." No, you're wrong. -"Lightning! -No! -That's was yesterday's password. -"Pizza Margherita!" Sure! "Four Seasons"! -It's "Queen Margherita"! -Yes, it's "Queen Margherita". We're supposed to conquer Greece with these four idiots?! Tomorrow I'll turn you all in. Understood? -Go take a chit! -Who said that? Who? Come on out! Bastards! I know that one. I recognized him. Ass-face! It wasn't me! It wasn't me! "It wasn't me!" Two days' punishment for all and four days for ass-face! Quiet! The British, I feeI it. Who goes there? The password! Identify yourseIf, or I shoot. Lieutenant, if it's you, say so. No! Don't shoot! Don't shoot. Silvana! My Silvana. It was SiIvana, boys, but... But I gave you specific orders... -You said to shoot, and we obeyed. -No. I said, "Stop, who goes there?" "ldentify yourself or I'll shoot." Lieutenant, I said, "ldentify yourself or I'll shoot." These guys fired. Strazza, it wasn't our fault. Bastards! -Easy! -Bastards! This morning the chickens, now the donkey! How will we carry the stuff? -The radio! -Shit! My radio! -Broken? -I don't know. -Can it be fixed? -I don't know. -Why don't you know? -I said I don't know. It was our most important equipment! To be kept in top working condition! We depended on it, and then that cretin of a mountain man broke it! Don't yell. Blaming him won't help now. Stay calm. Calm, my ass! Stay calm, my ass! We're cut off from the war! How do we communicate now? With smoke signals? My Silvana... There's nothing. O.K. boys, you'll stay here. For observation and liaison. When you see a ship, send up the signaI fIares. Toward us, not them. In two, three days I'll send another shift. Don't worry about us. We're not too familiar with the sea. If the relief shift isn't obligatory, we'll stay here. We'll come get our supplies. -Suit yourselves. -Thank you, Lieutenant. Lieutenant, one second. Munaron. The mission is now documented. See you. ITALY, I THINK AND DREAM OF YOU. Good morning, Lieutenant. -Good morning, Lieutenant. -Good morning. Some island! -An island of ghosts. There's nobody here. -The radio?... -Any news? -I've reassembled it. It won't work. I'm worried about the man because nothing's happening... and especially Strazzabosco. He's always by himself, withdrawn... and now his Silvana's dead... So let's invent something to boost their morale. We could have them dig a nice trench. -What for? -Nothing. They'll dig it and cover it up. -They'll get demoralized. -Let's mount a simulated attack. -In this heat? -Then what can I do to... -keep up their spirits? -Listen, Lo Russo, think of something. Now excuse me. I have to update the miIitary diary. I didn't realize... -Farina, are you married? -No. -Engaged? -No. -Is anyone back home waiting for you? -My foIks died when I was IittIe. I never knew them. It's nice here, right? Well... This may seem Iike an arid pIace, a pIace for sheep... but here, 2,500 years ago, before Rome, there was a beautifuI civiIization. There were poets, philosophers, warriors, goddesses. We're all their descendants. Even you can find your origins here. You understand? Do you Iike poetry? It depends. Look... these were written seven centuries before Christ. You know how to read? -Not in Greek. -Each poem is translated. The mountain peaks sleep, along with the valleys, cliffs and gorges... and creatures of the brown earth... Wake up! They've landed! I saw them! They're here! Lieutenant, wake up! -What happened, Sergeant? -Where did they Iand? -They're everywhere! Many of them! -The British? No! I tried catching one, but they disappeared. -Who are they? -Children. Strange, isn't it? There are no men. -Just old men and children. -It's fishy. -It couId be an ambush. -I remember simiIar situation in Spain. -Sure, sure! -Not again! Well, don't complain to me later... Madame, hello. The men... the soldiers, where are they? She still has a papa? You can speak ItaIian to me. I spent twenty years in Rhodes. ItaIians... Greeks... my face, my race... One face, one race. Father, where did all of you go? Why wasn't anyone here when we arrived? The Germans were here before you. They destroyed all the houses and sank the boats. They took all our men away-- deported them. When we saw your ship, we thought they had come back. So... we hid. I know the ItaIians weII. We don't like strangers in our country, but... it's lesser of two evils. I assure you, we'll create the least possible disturbance. I'd advise you to move into the Mayor's house. You'll be more comfortable. Where are you going? We're friends! Friends, friends. Wait! Come here! Regulations prohibit fraternizing with the locals. The first one who touches woman, hen or rooster... will be court-martialed. Understood? Why are you always screaming? Help us instead. Sergeant Lo Russo screams whenever he wants to because... sergeants scream. Is that cIear? Is that cIear??? A good hand! I'm just a dilettante. This man reminds me of the picture of Homer in my schooI textbook. For the first time since I Ieft home I feeI good. You're strange, you know? You don't seem like a soldier. The army called me back. In peacetime I'm a high school teacher. -Did I speak it right? -You speak Greek very weII. I Iearned Greek through books. The lliad, the Odyssey, the poets. I teach about Greece but I've never been here. With my salary... Who knows. Maybe this is destiny. Maybe I'm asking too much... but... have you seen our church? It's badly damaged. Would you consider... painting... the walls? I'd be honored but I'm not good enough to paint frescoes. Of course you're good enough! For free, of course. Sergeant, I found these enormous peppers. For your back-ache I'll fix a board for your bed. I'm also fixing up a piece of leather... Be carefuI! Leather... -How will you cook the peppers? -Stuffed. Sergeant! Hi, Noventa. -Guess what I've got. -A letter. Yes, to my wife. I'll leave it with you? Yes, I'll send it. -It's important. How long will it take? -Like the others. -I didn't put a stamp. -No problem. You can go, Noventa. Thanks. -You've seen the lieutenant? -No. -The lieutenant's not here? -No. There's a woman outside asking to talk to the commander. -The lieutenant isn't here? -The lieutenant's painting frescoes. We're sweating here, he's in a cool church. Should I show her in? If she wants to taIk, show her in. If not, she can stay outside. Lo Russo... beautifuI. She's beautiful. That's her. -Good morning. -You're the captain? Yes, I am. -I'm Vassilissa. Vassilissa. -Vassilissa? -Yes. -A beautifuI name. I'm Lo Russo... Nicola. -I speak... for "Duliam". -I don't know "Duliam". Sorry. You don't? Ergassia, you understand? Do we know Ergassia? Duliam Ergassia? -Work! ... Work! -Work? You want to talk about work? What kind of work do you do? I'm a "puta". -"Puta" is Greek for...? -A whore. -Please!! -Yes! Right! Whore! Yes. Good. Good... I mean... there are different ways of saying the same thing. You're interested? I have to gIance at the reguIations... -but we're very... we'd be interested. -Fine. And where... let's say... do you conduct your... where do these... -manifestations take place? The house? -My house. -Your house. -The blue house... blue. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Off on Thursday. Friday, Saturday, double shifts. Sunday: day off. Understood? -Why not alternate days? -Because this is what I decided. The order is based on age and rank. So, I'm first. -The lieutenant's first. -He doesn't go to prostitute. I'm first. Then Colasanti, then Noventa, Strazzabosco and then little Farina. -And the two brothers? -The damn Munarons! Mind your own business! I'm asking for a volunteer to call the two brothers up in the mountain. Without a volunteer, the brothers stay where they are. Speak to me oflove, Marie. All my life, it's you. Yourlovely wyes are shining Like two stars, they twinkle -Sergeant? -Thanks, dear. Tell me it's not a dream... I destroyed her. Tell me you're all mine. Instead of reading poetry, sing! You'll stop being afraid. Here, underyour heart, I'm no longer suffering. Bye. Vassilissa... Miss Vassilissa. Vassilissa! Farina, get the ball! -She won't give it to me. -Get going! Get it! Thanks. Alarm flares from the Munarons. Call the Lieutenant! All civilians in their homes! The enemy's here! Hurry! Who is it? The British? I don't see anyone yet! Lieutenant, Lieutenant. -You signaled the alarm? -Yes, Lieutenant. It's a ship with a red flag. -Shit! The Russians. -The flag's not exactly Russian. -It's more like Turkish. -Yeah, Turkish. -Are the Turks on our side? -What kind of ship? -Like a fishing boat. -A fishing boat. You signaled about a fishing boat? -We were told to report anything... -You did well. It could be a spy. There he is. ItaIians... Turks... One face, one race! I think it isn't only tobacco. Say what you want. There's something else in it. Not just tobacco. The smoke of oblivion. Like in the Odyssey. Odyssey. It tastes Iike sage. Tell me, do you have other stuff? Opium... cash... No, I meant rugs and such things. No rugs, no rugs. Lieutenant, rugs, cash, opium, who gives a damn! He doesn't know anything. -What's happening? What is going on? -Where? Where else? In ltaly... in Europe! -Dunno. -What "dunno"? I mean MussoIini, HitIer, Germany! -Dunno! -What?! Where did you come from? Cash... Antalia... Fatie... no war. -Let's confiscate the boat. -Why? To go to Rhodes, to ItaIy. -to where things are happening. -Do you care that much? Yes! We're in this God-forsaken place. We don't know what's happening anywhere. Aren't you curious? I say, let's go to the front where there's action. Fine... let's vote. Whoever agrees with the sergeant to confiscate poor Aziz's boat... to face a very dangerous journey to Rhodes for two days... without any certainty of arriving, raise your hand. Whoever whishes to stay, raise your hand. I don't vote because of my rank. We stay. What kind of vote is that? We're staying on the island of oblivion. Smoke some oblivion! It was a rigged vote. Did you ever think we'd end up here? Did you eat chicken with your finger? You pipe's glued to your hands. Pass it around! -What's chicken got to do with oblivion? -They both stick to your fingers. I think this stuff is prohibited in ItaIy right now. Why? Under Fascism everything good is prohibited. -Would you, Emperor, legalize it? -Who, the raisin? -What raisin? -What are you talking about? -As Emperor... -Sergeant Lo Russo. No guard duty... Savoy, eh? To the boat! I don't agree. With the sloppy and relaxed attitude that prevails among you. Being a comrade, I can't go ir against the tide... I can't go against the wishes of the majority. I aIso understand your rebeIIious attitude toward authority because of... -the absolute negligence of the state. -What the fuck are you saying, Lo Russo? What are you saying? I'm saying what I'm saying. I too feel... abandoned by my country, by ItaIy. And I don't give a shit! And I'll say it again! They left us here, and here we'll stay! They said, "You'll manage", and... we're managing. -What are they saying, Aziz? -Dunno. You always "dunno". You dunno nothing! Hi, Aziz. Friend... friend! Take me home! Take me along! Friends! ItaIy, Turkey... one face, one race! He stole everything! Everything! Now what! We stay here Iike a bunch of idiots. Never trust the Turks. Hell, don't laugh, Father! We don't even have a weapon. How can we occupy the island? Come with me. Come with me. We've had weapons all along. We're friends, right? Why won't you make love with me? -Because. -Are you embarrassed? What's the most beautiful thing on earth? Some say a swarm of knights, others say infantrymen, yet others say ships. I say it's the one I love. And then it continues. A Greek poet wrote it... over 2,000 years ago. Yes, but why won't you make love with me? Why? -I've never done it. -Never? But... I want the first time to be for Iove... really for love, you understand? Life isn't enough... One life isn't enough for me. There aren't enough days... too many things to do, too many ideas... Every sunset upsets me because another day has gone by. Then I'm moved, because I'm alone... a tiny dot in the universe. I'd like to watch sunsets with my mother... or with a woman I might Iove. I'd like to spend the nights alone... alone, or... maybe with a beautifuI sIut which is better than aIone... Did the Turk Ieave any of that stuff? "Dunno" was his name. Thanks. If things were aIways this way... if they took your weapons and left this stuff, we'd live better, right? -Come on, come on. -We're coming. -You go first. -No, you go. -No, I won't go! -Go! You know what Father always said? "If necessary, float on shit." -I'd like to see him! -Ready? One, two, three... Vassilissa, what about this? Mine. -A gun in your kitchen? -For the enemies. -May I ask you something? -What? I've been waiting to ask you... No, no, nothing. Never mind. Go ahead. Go on. How come you're a... How come you're... a... -Prostitute? -Yes. My mother is a prostitute. My grandmother's a prostitute. My sister's a prostitute. Logical, isn't it? LogicaI... IogicaI. What did you do before? Where were you? Why did you come here? -Here? -Yes. In Athens I worked with the Germans. The Germans brought me here. They Ieft. I stayed. The end. -You like it here? You want to stay here? -I don't know. It's fine here... for now. But you'll... you'll always, always be... A prostitute? I... I... I don't know. Maybe I'll open a tavern. -It's a massacre! Penalty! -I didn't hurt him! -Lieutenant, fuck off! -You fuck off! Calm down! Now... it's a penalty. On two conditions. One: that you do the kicking. Two: that I do the bIocking. I'm hypnotizing you! It's already blocked! The pepper got you, eh? Go on! Kick! It's been 15 minutes! I hypnotized you, but... Don't show me where you'll kick... It's already blocked. Move away! What the hell? My God! He's ltalian. He's one of us. -ItaIians? -Lieutenant RaffaeIe Montini. Sergeant Nicola Lo Russo. Lieutenant Carmelo La Rosa. Anyway, I saw it. There was no penalty. You are ItaIian soIdiers? -Aegean? -I think so. I had engine troubIe, nothing serious, just a coupIing. I'm headed for Crete. Our division was united with the British. -The British??! -Sure! They have... some incredible planes! The British and the Americans are very organized. British and Americans? Did you surrender? Who? You don't know about anything! Not even September 8th? So what? Every year there's September 8, 9, 10... What about September 8th? -How Iong have you been here? -Since June. -June of what year? -'41. -'41, '42... '43... Three years? -What? You've been here three years? Hear that? Three years. He's been here three years! -We've all been here three years! -All of you? We arrived together. Then you know nothing? You have no radio, or anything? -We had one. -I'll explain it all. Mussolini fell. ItaIy is divided. South, the British and Americans. North: The Germans and Fascists. In between the CLN. -What's the CLN? -National Liberation Committee-- the partisans. There's a civil war. Friends have become enemies, and vice versa. There's lots of turmoil, many opportunities, and much to do. We can't remain outside of it. There are big ideals at stake. Lots of money can be made. Done! -It's fixed. -And this? The plane's got too many parts! That piece is useless. Leave it there. I'll let headquarters know you're here. A chip or something might come by. If you get back, drop in on me in PaIermo. Brig the woman, the wives... whatever, anybody! Three years! Hard to believe! Three years! Come on! Take me along! Why can't you? -Hey, just a minute. -Take me home! -Take me home! -Take it easy! Calm down. I am caIm. I want to go home. You could at least have taken the letters! It's over. Soon they'll come for us... and take us home. And we won't see each other again. I don't know how many men I've been with. I don't remember any of their faces. When you leave, I won't remember... you, either. Yes... Me, you'll remember. Let's do it? Why? -A nice game, right? -Yes, nice. -Look who's spoiling everything. -Mind your own business! You're just lucky, Pope! The dice are round, but still... I knew it! I'll never get used to it. It's like drinking sand. Let it settle on the bottom. Learn to wait. Smell the aroma, and wait. That's the enjoyment. What are you saying? Coffee is coffee! You order it, drink it and Ieave. Shit! Wait! Everybody waits! What's there to wait for? -I'll check it. -What happened? -Hi. What happened? -Farina shot at me. -What? -It was my turn. He's inside with her. He wouldn't let me in. I knocked and knocked... and started knocking down the door. He shot at me from the window. -Is he crazy? -It seems impossible. What's going on? -Antonio? -Go away, all of you! You understand? Leave us alone. -He's gone nuts! -What'll we do? What'll we do? -Go get Raffaele. -Me? -Should I go? -Why me? -I couId go. -ShouId he go? Go on! Does it hurt? It must hurt a IittIe. See? It hurts. Go on! Go, Garibaldi! That guy shoots! -Nino? -One step closer and I shoot! Oh, he talks big! Fuck off, Nino! -He's real crazy. -An idiot! Real scary. -It's true. -Let's see it. Does it hurt? It's not serious. -Just a scratch. -What the hell got into him? He's inside with Vassilissa and won't let anyone in. -Why? -He won't respect the scheduled turns. Talk to him. Nino! Raffaele's here to see you. Antonio, what are you doing? Nobody' to touch Vassilissa! That goes for you too, Lieutenant. O.K., Antonio, but that's her line of work. I mean, she's taken certain psycho-physical needs to heart... she's proposing a solution... -I mean, she's a prostitute. -Not after today! I love her. -What? -I Iove her, Lieutenant. I Iove her. He Ioves her. Vassilissa? Do you Iove him, too? Yes. Boys, that changes everything. How can we go against feelings? -We can't? -What do you say? We can't. His feelings shot me in the arm. Oh, come on, it's not serious. I have to go back... The coIor is drying up. Best wishes and lots of male children... my color's drying. Get that disinfected. One guy's color dries, another guy's wound dries. Let's go. Sorry. Now Vassilissa and Antonio are man and wife. Drink to your marriage. And then you, Antonio, will break the glass... to make sure nothing will interfere with your happiness. ItaIians are Iike Turks, huh? One race, one stomach! Lieutenant. Where's Noventa? I don't know. Know what this reminds me of? When the vacation was over. That's when we went back to school. Vacation was over and we headed home. This atmosphere here reminds me of that moment. I wonder if it's right. The world changes, and we're here. Right or not, that' how it is. It's destiny. Destiny! Destiny... can be manipulated... You can try to have things go as you'd like. One can change destiny. It's not easy. Sometimes one has to obey destiny. Did you see that star? Did you make a wish? It's not easy. Know what I'd like? A nice ship to take me away. Not that it's bad here. But... I'm beginning to feel... a need for a person. Someone... to be in Iove with. Sergeant, I... I couId be that person. I'm in love with you. I don't know how the hell it happened. They're British! -Can we be sure they're friends now? -Things change. ItaIians. -What did he say? I didn't hear it. -"ltalians". What the fuck do they want? Dimitri. Dimitri! They are taliani, are taliani. Who are those guys? They used to live here. They're coming home. Not allowed... not allowed to take animal on the boat. He and I, we're together. And we're going home together. To ltaly. If he can't go, I won't go either. I'll stay. I won't move. Try to move me! See? A IittIe reasoning... Come, GaribaIdi. How much stuff are you taking? Sergeant... What is this? We'll never see each other again? Not again! We have the whole ocean trip! Where's Farina? I can't fucking find him. -I'll look for him. -How much stuff are you taking? -Where is he? -I don't know. -Tell me where! They'll leave him here! -I don't know! -What's up? -"What's up?"? What's up? What do you want? What do you mean, "What's up?"? Come out and let's go! I won't come. This is my house. I'm married... I'm staying here. Those guys won't wait. They're British. Your marriage isn't valid in ltaly. Move it! Let's go! It's valid for me. Very valid. Bring her too. Let's go! They won't wait! Where to?... Where? I have no home, no job. I'm alone. Why should I leave? No! Everything's changing. ltaly needs rebuilding from the ground up. There's much confusion. It's a great opportunity. We'll build a great nation, I promise you. It's also our duty. What duty? Even you agreed. Remember? They forgot about us. I want to forget them. Rebuild ltaly, chance the world! I don't believe in it. I can't. I'm staying here. In an oIive barreI on a deserted isIand? Is that your ambition? I feeI aIive, here, for the first time. You understand? Vassilissa wants to start a restaurant. She needs me. Don't be upset, Sergeant. We're friends, aren't we? Attendant Farina, this is desertion, you know that. -I Iove you. -Me too. I can't believe in it. An olive? -I'm not hungry. -Take one. I said I'm not hungry. Farina disappeared completely. Disappeared. I Iooked everywhere. -He must have fled to the mountains! -Probably. Maybe he's right. Raffaele, we're going to build a great nation. You'll see. He'll come back to live there, too. You'll see. Give me an olive. ltalians, Greeks, my race, my face one face... one race... Where did you end up? RESTAURANT VASSILISSA Lieutenant! Antonio, I'm so very sorry. I wasn't sure about the address. Thank you. Thanks, Lieutenant. -You've lived here all along? -Yes... Did you see the restaurant? I have a surprise for you! Look who Ianded here! Who? Lo Russo! Hell! Lieutenant! Life wasn't so good in ltaly. They didn't let us change anything. So? So I toId them... "You win..." "but don't consider me your accomplice." That's what I told them. And so I came here. And you? What will you do now? I'll give you a hand... DEDICATED TO ALL THOSE ARE RUNNING AWAY subtitle by PINOYPIRATE
