No one knows where he is. Sure he knows that you're here. He will call you. What is this all about? You told me your father is a big businessman. Who is your father? What is he doing?! He told me he is running business. What a Tamilian running a business here? ls a businessman will hide from policeman? Your father doing wrong work.

For them. l wanted to be a good leader and a father. My decision... Not to spoil your future.. l stayed away from you all these years... Then why do you need to hide? l'm not a Gandhi nor Buddha.

That is why l'm hiding from police. Don't. Follow me back. Where do you want me to go? This is an one way road. Only life will go away from here. Once we took the cleaver, lt will either to guard us, or to destroy us. We can't let it go. Today.. the things you saw... Forget all. Go back. l was believing that you're happy here.. That is why l was living there.. l'm not going back. You don't need life like this. Let it go with me. You need to go.. Get married with the girl you love.. Live happily. My wish as a father. The father and his daughter got scared seeing us. They are leaving tonight. They never listen to us. And they went to stay at a hotel. Which hotel? - Don't. Situation is not good outside. And the police department... lt will be troublesome if all of you follow. l'll go alone. lt's my son's life. Dad, she's Meera. l'm not here as Anna. l came as his Viswa's father. lt's getting late, you go in. Taxi will be here soon. Pack up soon. You go back... Bring back my son too. You saw my life. He is not involve in it. For my sake, His life... Dad, you don't need to do this for me... No, this must happen. For my mistakes, don't spoil my son's.. Sun news. Because of the death of Anna while under police custody. There is a clash between police and public. The clash grew big. On this Delhi have ordered Emergency, by this people's life effected. lt's a say that police did the murder of Anna.What is your answer? What do you want me to do? Who murdered Anna? Who are the people involved? Give me order to investigate on this case. You are young. With a young blood. This is a system. We're not alone in this system. Politicians in it, and so criminals. Police and the system is here to keep law and order. lf we ourselves do wrong?! Then what the need law and order? Even l was like you when l became a policeman. Will question everything, and fight for law. Nothing changes here. The one that changed is me. l can't change myself such, sir. lf l felt l'm changing as you say, l will quit. lt's my 25 years of determination. You have fulfill my father's dream. People like Anna will now realize what will happen when they oppose a politician. You're in charge in everything here after this. He have the whole place in his control. We can't live opposing Bheema. We were in safe hand when Anna was around. But now we have no one... l'm here. You are new here.You're talking without knowing Bheema's capabilities. He killed Anna. We're nothing. How can we oppose knowing you are backing us up... -What are you talking?! He's saying that he will back us up right?! Keep on talking nonsense. lf we scared today, it will prolong for life. Bro, l'm believing in you. Let the non believer leave. Don't you come inside this life. This world totally different. What should happen, it happened. None can change that. Don't confused yourself... - Must bring people who involved to justice. Even the justice is in their control, right. That is how they killed Anna... We know how to get revenge on Anna's death. Ticket. This is the ticket for you to go back. Please leave this place. We don't want to lose you too. This wasn't my decision, its Anna's decision. ls there any other way to go airport? No, it will turn to green soon. We'll move. Listen to me! Don't go! Your death will be a lesson for others. lf anyone try to oppose Bheema in this Mumbai... Viswa, listen to me. Let's go from here.

Must pack up everything and leave from here! Understood?! This is a murder case. We can't give bail. We need to see him. You can't see him. What will you do? Get out. lf anything happen to Viswa as happened to Anna... Let's go. We see him in court. What case? lt's a murder case. He killed Bheema's men. The accused is Anna's son. lt seems Anna raised him oversea. Where is he? Centraljail? Mahim station. ln police custody. Then it's hard to get bail. -Yes. Small kid.You're doing things not knowing who we are. l thought of letting you go.. l seen you. l was searching for you. And l saw you. So? l shouldn't kill someone else thinking you, right.

Police should protect civilians, because of officer like him civilians protecting us. None came to witness your murder not because of fear... Because of respect. The word 'leader' is not a word we go for. lt should come to us. They are calling you. Calling you as their leader. This money isn't for you. lt's for us. For our safety. Please take it. All of you are employees at Anna's trust. You will receive salary monthly. And this is the atm card. He is Kumar. He having a video shop. At his opposite shop there is a internet cafe.

But he is talking to that kind of people. They not ordinary people. They are rowdies and gangsters. What is the meeting about? - Don't do all these, repent. We will give money monthly for you. What is all this? You look totally different. l know you can't come after dad's lost. l didn't aspect you will stay permanently here. We don't need all this. Let's go back. Where do you want me to go? This is one way road. Only life goes from here. Once we took the cleaver, lt will either to guard us, or to destroy us. But we can't let it go. Come Bheema, tell me. lt won't take long time to do as l did to make you a minister. What happened? -Viswa getting stronger, and you didn't do anything! What do you want me to do? A big group of people backing him up. lf we let him, he'll be the next Anna. We can't destroy him with anger. But with smartness. With political smartness. Why did you ask me to come here? Look there.They are protesting to chase out non Maharishians from Mumbai. So what? What are trying to say now? This is Mathunga area. Maharisian population very less here. Bihari and Tamilian are more in this area. Today there will be a big clash between Maharisian and rest. And for sure Viswa will come to settle the clash. At that time we will kill him. How will he be here? - Sure he will come. For the sake of these people. What should l do here? - Don't do anything. You just avoid police to interfere till we kill Viswa. Ok, what is your plan? All of them our men. After you leave from here. They will split to 2 groups, one group will join as the protester. Another group will be with civilians. Once they at positions, the ones with the civilian will throw stones at the protester. Once someone get injured, protester will run off. But our men inside protester's group will throw petrol bomb to civilians. And the rest will join them. And a big clash will start. He recorded everything, catch him. l'm videographer Kumar here. -Yes, Kumar. ln Mathunga area... Viswa - Uncle. A big clash going on at Mathunga, go and check it up. Turn the van. -Yes. A big clash happened, and none of the policemen came to the scene! We did call them. -Then why weren't they came?! What is the problem there? -They asking non Maharisian to send off. lf not they warned that they will burn down this hospital. Don't you involve in this. We save and brought them from the incident. l don't know who is Bihari, Tamil, nor Maharisian among them. lf you can figure it out. Go ahead. Get them and kill them. Come here! Look at him. Can you figure it out by seeing at his blood? Whether is he Maharisian or else?! lf can, kill him! Can you see anything from that innocent girl? lf you can see, kill her! Do you know anyone among them? Are any of them is your enemy? No, right?! Then why must these innocent people die?! For the sake of who?! They created cast, language and rest to live. You beat and chasing off because they areTamilian, Bihar and rest... Tomorrow in their land, they will do the same to your brothers. lt will prolong forever. You and him not from other country! All belongs to the same country, lndia! Everyone have rights to stay anywhere. lf you still feel to kill them, go and kill them! Get up, slowly. - Don't. Give us some poison. We'll die drinking it. They will send all of us out from here. Better we'll die rather than end up on the street begging without home. Not everyone gets a family, few like me doesn't have parents.

How many bars in Bhendra? There is 6 to 7 bars. What song is this? Hindi? Bhojpuri. Where is the most Bhojpuri people located? He's not in this bar. Go and check the other bar.

Now... Sing. She's asking about your mother! She's from police department! See what have they done? We got scared that they did something to you too. l didn't know. We didn't know what happened. We saw their bodies in the morning. We got so scared thinking they have done something to you too. Everyone who was here for you left you. They even didn't leave the girl who loved you. l mistakenly doubt her.. Where is uncle? - l have searched for him everywhere. We're scared he might be killed too. Call for you. Many of you people died for you. Don't sacrifice one more life. lf you want back your uncle... You must come alone. You stay here. You only need me right? Let him go... You told me, using him we can get Anna. lt happened. And told me, using you to get Viswa. And it happened too. You destroyed his whole empire in one night. You such a great person. Murali, where are you? l'm here. Where are you? Who are you all?! Only left is Viswa. Why are you referring as a great person. l was doing everything you asked. l will continue doing. Ask the builders company to chase people from Mahim. And take the land. After this no one will oppose you. Whatever it is, he is my brother's son. He's still alive. Don't take time. Finish him off. l'll make a move. Get in. Let's go. Brother is not coming? - Get in. Dad, where is he? Give me the phone. Bheema have murdered Viswa. You can arrest Bheema if you go there now. What are you talking?! What happened to him?! l have killed him. Pass me the cash as you said, and get the Mahim port. What is going on? What are you doing?! He never listen me that we can live wealthy after all we went thru. He never live wealthy and didn't let me too. That is why l bring Viswa back here and get him. But l didn't think Viswa will take over his dad's place. l was working for my brother, and now need to work for his son?! After this there won't Bheema nor Viswa. After this l'm the leader, you're my assistant. We received information that Bheema have murdered Viswa. Bheema and his men at the murder spot. What are you saying. -You can arrest them if you go now. What happened? - Bheema and rest tried to escape. That is why.. l thought the thing l loved most is my profession, But l get to know that l love Viswa more than this. Where are you heading to without telling anyone? No one can oppose Viswa in Mumbai after this. That is why l'm getting out from here. Few months later... Lawyer Radhakrishnan is here to see you. Yesterday had a case, l only could fight in court.. but didn't get justice.
