Are these figure just preliminary? Yes, the eruption began only 15 minutes ago. And yet, it's exactly as we predicted. 12 kilometer high plumes, 2000 tons of ash per second, the multiple earthquakes. This is going to carry on for a few days, we'd better start revising the model. We'll need data from the other sites as well. Call the monitoring stations, I want facts, before I call the authorities. You really think this is it? If the data holds to the model, I think it is. Oh really? Again? What's up Perkins? Isis erupted again. It's an annual event, apparently. First it was Ian, a year ago. Then Greenverner. And now lakagigar. Wonderful language skills you got there. Be careful, you'll get a posting there. So how bad? Probably the strongest yet. It only happened about an hours ago, and it had already reached 17 kilometers. 17 kilometers? You know, that is really bad. What's the spread? Winds aren't too strong. Alright keep me posted. Oh one moment. What's happening with that little storm system in the northwest Atlantic? It's gathering strength. Temperature is down 12 degrees. Pressure is down by 240 milibars. If that crosses the ash cloud, it would rather a mess. Yes it will. Alright, if there is even a possibility of a major grounding, the sooner the People know the better. Spread the good news. Will do cornel. Thank you control. This is 165 out. What was that all about? An ash cloud? Not much I hope. Morava nb1765. Reduce altitude to 30,000 ft. and report. Roger that control. 1765, reducing altitude. Ah, there it is. The coast. Ah, the septedial. This blessed plot. What's that? Shakespeare darling. Oh, right of course. Lucky you are so handsome. Why are they having you reduce altitude? Oh, I'm sure it's just an air traffic issue. Control, this is 1765. We are at 30,000 feet. Roger, 1765. Stand by for further instructions. Roger that. Four years ago my team built a model predicting Icelandic volcanic activity and this Morning's eruption hews almost exactly to the parameters established in that model. The amount of ash and lava, the 5.5 magnitude earthquake. Consequently, we believe the second phase we predicted will shortly begin. A series of linked eruptions throughout northern and central Europe. Oh god. What we are going to see is the seismic activity of one volcano triggering the next Along the fault lines at the edge of the tectonic plate. I've never heard of such a thing. -You cant be serious. -No no no no no Germany, Italy, France, Greece... It could be a matter of days, if not hours. Oh my oh no, dr. This is a complete disaster, this can't be. A disaster of this nature. Your figures must be mistaken. Please, please no one wants to cause a panic, but you should Begin making arrangements to move people from the affected areas. And what exactly are the affected areas? Approximately 83% of the European landmass. You ok right? I mean this isn't a 747, champagne, caviar, and All that fancy stuff. No, this is fun. It's romantic. Just the two of us. Well my ex didn't like flying in small planes. Her loss. What about you? Not wishing this was a fighter jet? I'll let you know young lady. I've flew e-3's. Right. You know what I meant. You sure you don't miss the air force? I don't miss the air force. I've had enough danger for one lifetime now. Now it's just quality time. Quality romantic time with my new beautiful wife. you're sweet. But you don't have to keep selling. I'm already here. I'm not selling. I just find it unbelievable sometimes. kids are going to love you. Maybe. They will. Well, I won't take it personally if they are resentful. 1765, you're on route to Paris le Bourget. Roger that control. I'm afraid all non-emergency air traffic is being grounded immediately due to Atmospheric conditions. You'll have to land at London city. Control. We can be in Paris is less then an hour. That's a negative 1765, reduce altitude to 25,000 feet and report. Roger that control. 1765 reducing altitude. I don't see any clouds. It must be coming in faster then expected. Our temperature is dropping. Look at the outometer There is a barometric abnormality. May be it's just as well we are landing. You think the kids are going to be ok? They'll be fine. This must be all over the news. Still you should check in. I'll give them a call when we land. I wonder when that could is going to reach us. Hopefully not until dad and what's her name get here. Lacey? Whatever. Ok, so we have 4, we have 5 stops until we get to gala Dulles. No we got to take a bus to the airport? Or should we just take a train? Ryan? Hello? Ryan? It's like the freakin' end of the world coming. Can you stop Being a perve long enough to pay attention. There is nothing perverted about admiring a beautiful woman. It is when you do it to every single woman that walks by. It's Paris. You know? The whole reason I'm going to grad school here is to experience another culture. Right. And I thought cause every single woman in America shot you down. Anyway, it's probably not the end of the world. Just an ash cloud. It's like that ia-ge-fur... Whatever how you pronounce it, went off years back They just cancelled flights and that was the end of it. Do you think it's going to affect dad's flight? Let's hope not. Man, you know, I really have to visit that thing before I graduate. What? You haven't been to the Eiffel tower? Oh my god, Ryan what is wrong with you? Such a loser. You know Tyran, you might consider being nicer to me. You really think that mom and dad would have let you transfer to the parson's program If I wasn't already here in Paris? Their little girl. awll awone in a fowegn country. No way. Especially with your history. I don't need a baby sitter. I'm fine. In fact, I'm doing great. So glad to hear it. That's why I want to get to the airport. Not on time but early. I want dad to see that I'm not this little girl no more. And this semester has matured me. So he'll pony up for the summer session? I just want him to be proud of me. Even though he is midlife crisising. Agh, Tyran? What? The ink is not even dry on the divorce and he runs off to marry some random chick. Mom left him. What do you want him to do? Sit around crying Around and apologizing for the rest of his life? Yeah. Sounds about right. How many times did mom spend crying and alone. The guy is a pilot, of course he's going to have to... You know what? We're not doing this. You and I are not having our own little version Of the same fight mom and dad had for 20 years. They divorced. Dad remarried. Yeah. Some chick he knew 5 minutes. Who's my age. That's gross. She's older. Still. Well, we are still doing alright on time. They probably haven't hit England yet. Alright, I just don't wanna take any chances. You know how dad is about punctuality. If we're late we're grounded... For life. Control. This is 1765. We're at 20,000 feet. Roger 1765, switch to 119.725 for London city. Roger that control. Good luck 765. Thank you control. This is 1765. Out. Incredibly, reports are coming in of yet another eruption of The European continent, Breaking news from Europe. The 4th volcanic eruption has Shooken up the Greek island of Santorin. Long thought to be inactive, today's Explosion was accompanied by violent earthquakes and Voluminous ash which, due to the mountain's great elevation, is Already over 30,000 feet high and spreading more than twenty miles to the northeast. ...Terrorized and ruins, with more then 3,000 appear dead. Haven been caught... Volcanic ash. Formed some 300,000 years ago by what scientist call... Come populated but as the ash clouds from multiple eruptions... There is already over a billion tons of magma ejected. Two billion tons of ash. That's within parameters. But the sulpher dioxide, more than two billion tons so far and already A 7 percent drop in temperature. Don't you see what's happening here? We have to revise the model. There's thirty three percent more ash in the atmosphere than our model Predicted and it's spreading faster than predicted as well. We're revising our projections as we speak, but it is essential, For you to prepare for the new reality. Which is what exactly? That temperatures will also drop faster than predicted, it's going to get very cold, very Quickly. In about 20 minutes, I'll have the exact- You've already been mistaken doctor, how do we know you're correct now? New data is just coming in as we speak, but I don't think you Should wait for the revised model to take action. I dunno. Geez... We'll have to get back to you doctor. Thank you sir. Ana! Yes doctor. Get me colonel Dillard at the Gelsenkirchen airbase, will you? Right away. London. City control. This is Aravanb 1765. We're on scheduled landing. We've got you 765. Make your heading 122.5 degrees, reduce altitude to 12,000 feet. Roger that control. I'm sure they are going to be late anyway. Tyran probably got side tracked by a couple fancy boutiques. You know you should go easy on her. She's in a tough age. she's always at a tough age. Girls. We're complicated. What I'm paying for that school. Jesus! Look at that thing. Oh. Maybe that's a good thing we're landing. But then how are we going to get to Paris? One crisis at a time. London control. This is 1765. We're at 12,000 feet. Yes I'll be on my way colonel and I will explain more in detail when I Arrive at the base but in the meantime I don't think we can afford to Wait for the authorities to take action. Doctor, I do not understand. The multiple eruptions and earthquakes are linked colonel, there's far more magma, Ash and sulpher dioxide being released than predicted. The result is something, something we've never seen before. The model I sent you should help explain it, do you have it open? Yes, yes I've got the model open. Then you should be able to see the fault lines, which exist Along the edges of the tectonic plate. Okay Would you please get me a warmer jacket and a clean shirt? Sorry about that colonel, as I was saying. Do you mind if I put you on speakerphone for a moment? Of course not. As I was saying it was a massive tectonic shift in the mid-Atlantic Rift under Iceland that caused a chain reaction earthquakes And volcanic eruptions across the continent. But currently, the ash clouds from these separate eruptions Are merging and spreading as one through the atmosphere. And because the cloud are blocking out the sun, temperatures are falling. Yes, but... Due to the pre-existing storm system in the north Atlantic, The glacial melt has increased exponentially. Look, how can that be? Temperatures falling? Glaciers melting? Surely that means temperatures are rising. No, because the chemical make up of volcanic debris sends increased sulfide Levels into the atmosphere, thus increasing precipitation. Alright, alright. How long is it going to take before this cloud dissipates? Click the blue tab on the model, will you? Well the cloud is projected to block the sun for the next eighteen to Twenty four months at least. And all that time, Temperatures will continue to plummet. Is it snowing there yet? What? No. No no it's not. Good, it's only a matter of time. Doctor, how much snow are we talking about here? Given the enormous amount of moisture rising into the atmosphere. Look, we're still working on the model for that. It should be ready by the time I reach the base, will that do? Yes of course. Wait one moment doctor. Let me quite clear about this. What you're saying is that this storm will persist in a matter of years. What is going to happen to Europe? I mean, how much of Europe will remain habitable? I don't wish to engage in hyperbole colonel. I'm receiving new data just right now. I'll really have to get back to you. Have we heard from headquarters lately? I think we should give them a little call. And um, I'd like to review the emergency protocols. If this thing is going to go pear shaped I think we awt to be prepared. See to it. ...The tectonic shifts causing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions in Iceland And the European continent are also Affecting the arctic circle. Scientists in Murmansk report glacial breaks as Long as ten kilometers, while experts from The Byrd polar research center estimate the rise in sea level from rapidly Melting polar ice will flood coastal cities in Scandinavia and beyond. Residents of those areas are advised to move inland as quickly as possible To ensure their own safety. To allow government officials to make preparations Against this global phenomenon. London city airport will be closed in forty-five minutes, all personnel should Whoo, it's cold as hell out there. We didn't pack for this weather. There's no signal. We could try the staffline phone. We should call the kids. Well, why don't we wait and figure out a game plan here. Why don't you call the? Ok. It got a little nippy huh? Yeah, it'll be warm in the metro. Oh my god it's dad! He must be calling from the plane. Hi dad, hey look we're just getting the metro right now, soo. Hey Ryan hold on a second. Listen, we won't be landing in le bourse, we had to land in London because the ash cloud. Has it gotten there yet? No, it's not but it's coming. It's cold and dark in the middle of the day, are you guys ok? Yeah we're fine. How are you guys doing? How's Tyran? She's great, wanna say hi? Hey dad. Hello Taryn. Would you put me on the speakerphone Hun. Ok. Listen guys, we are going to be grounded here in London for a few days because of the weather. So why don't you hold up in the apartment and after it clears up we'll reconnect. How is that? Ok. Ok yeah, sounds good. Hey tell lacey we say hi! Oh hi guys, can't wait to meet you. Us too, us too. Alright guys we'll talk in a couple days. Bye. Bye. Awe he's so sweet. Yeah. Kiss ass. What? You're a kiss ass. "kiss-ass"? I'm just trying to be nice. So what's the plan? The plan is to get a nice hotel room and start our honeymoon right now. You know if the planes are going to be grounded, the roads and the trains are Going to be packed. Maybe we should head to Paris right now. - Right now? - Yeah. Right now? Mmhmm. Good idea. Ok, I'll go rent us a car and you book us a ticket on the Eurostar. Sounds good. May be on the way there we can get some winter gear for us and the kids. That's a good idea. Yeah. Let's go to the market before we go home, if there's a Storm coming, it'll be good to stock up. Sure. Taryn. I guess that's the ash cloud. I guess it is. Whoo, did you feel that, it just got really cold. Yeah weird, let's get going. yeah Cmon! Cmon! Oh god, Ryan! Ryan, Ryan are you ok?! I think so, nice going t. Soccer kicks footballs ass. Ok cmon, it's not safe. Cmon, we gotta get outa here. Any luck? No but I've gotten to hear "do you really wanna hurt me" eighty seven times. I will never look at boy George the same way again. This weather's a mess, why don't we just get a motel for the night and we'll Get an early start in the morning? Steve, why is it me that's pushing you to see your kids? What? Shouldn't this be all your idea? Well, I guess it should be. I guess I have to get used to thinking like a good parent. Mhm It'll be a little difficult considering I was always told I was such a bad husband... Well... It takes two to make a marriage work. It does... Or not work. Listen I love you, and I know you're a good man. Thank you honey. God, I can't believe it's snowing. Check the radio, see what's going on. Ok. Potentially the worst snow storms since 1908, when more than 26 inches fell over three days in April. Currently in London the temperature is below zero and dropping steadily. Dozens of cities Around the nation are without power, but we will continue to broadcast As long as are able. This can't be right. How certain are you? The projection is based on current data. 16 inches of ash will cover Europe? The sun will be blocked out by this cloud for 2 years. Earthquakes, after shocks. Temperatures will fall below zero and remain there. And snow will continue to fall more or less continuously for the next 22 months. My god man. This is an unmanageable catastrophe. Well it's a situation colonel, like I said, I don't like to engage in hyperbole. Hyperbole! Hyperbole! Good god man if these projections are correct. Europe on the large portion of the Northern hemisphere, have just entered into a new ice age. At least the hail stopped. Do you want to head home or go to the market? Let's do both. Let's go get some boat, jackets. Let's stock up on food and water and hold Up in the flat like dad said, ok? Ok. Sounds like a plan. Ryan, what are you doing, you're such a cluts. I didn't anything. You think it's the metro? Look. help me! Earthquake! Ryan! What? Come with me. No no no it's fine. Come with me. No no no. My brother. Ryan! My brother is there. He's probably dead. I can save you. Let me go! You are panicking. Come with me. Let me go! Come on. Ok. If you insist. ooww! Asshole. Ryan! Ryan! Are you ok? Taryn? You ok? I asked you first. Ah! It sucked. I think I hit my head. I got hit on by some crazy French guy in the middle of this earthquake. Whatever it is. another earthquake. We got to get outta here. Let's go. Do you think the earthquakes are related to the ash cloud? Or the volcanoes? I don't know. We should keep moving. Where are we going to go? I don't know. The embassy? They've got to have some kind of Emergency plan to protect american citizens. It's so cold. What are we gonna do? Ryan I'm scared. I'm really scared. Be scared later. Taryn! Taryn! Go! Go! Go! Go! You think it's over? I don't know it fells like it's just the beginning. Oh man, look at that. Totally smashed. Do your phone work? There's no signal. Maybe at the embassy? Let go to place de la Concorde. at least the earthquake has stopped. For now. Come on, let's go. Preliminary reports put the temblor at 8.4 on the richter scale. Hospitals are overwhelmed with with wounded, and thousands Are still unaccounted for in the sudden wreckage littering Paris. While the city has seen minor earthquakes in its History, never has there been anything of this severity. Even The Italian quake of 1908 was only 7.5 magnitude... Ok Im calling the kids again. No, no I've got another idea. Ok who are we calling? Colonel ralph Dillard, we served together in desert storm. He's with NATO now But he's commander of Gelsenkirchen, he'll know what's going on. Hello. Ralph, Steve Foster here. Steve. This is not a good time to talk I'm afraid. No I understand that sir, I'm in England and my kids are in Paris. Paris? Have you spoken to them? Yeah about three hours ago but not since the earthquake sir. My dear fellow I'm so sorry. No no no that's alright they're smart kids they're probably alright I'm sure. Oh yes of course. I didn't mean ... Oh We're heading to Paris right now. How are you getting there? We're going to the euro tunnel to put the car on the train. Have you made a booking? No we can't get through. Alright, I may be able to help you there. What's your eta? Little over an hour or so depending on the weather and traffic. Alright. I'm in Germany but I got a friend of mine in Truckston. Thanks ralph. What about the kids? What's that? The kids, we haven't spoken with 'em since before the earthquake. They don't know we're coming, and we don't know where they're at. Well the good news is the mobile system in Paris is still working. It's crowded but Keep trying and you may get through. What's the bad news, more earthquakes? The earthquakes are the least of our problems. Then what's the bigger problem? Look, Steve. This ash cloud combined with a freak storm and some circumstances That I don't fully understand. Anyway the long story short... The Cold is going to get colder. And the snow is going to get deeper. Tell me there's a way out of this, colonel. Steve. Europe is finished. This is a global crisis. Now think Back to your emergency protocols. They are executing Operation, down under.. We are going to evacuate all Plato personal & their families To Australia. I will have c-160's leaving every 2 hours for the next 10 hours. If you can get here, I premises you, I will have a place for you on those planes. Colonel I don't know if I can get to Germany in 10 hours, it Might take me that long just to get to Paris. How about Evreux? That's a good possibility. If you can get over there I'll get a mi8 pick you up there. Go By Paris and bring you here, alright. I'll do my best. Well you got 10 hours to find them and get you. After that I can't help. Now listen Steve, I owe you big. This is the best I can do. I've got an Awful lot on my plate at the moment. No I understand colonel, when I see you in 10 hours, we'll be even. Well, I look forward to see you. Good bless. Thank you colonel, out. What exactly did you do for him? Nothin' he wouldn't have done for me. Where's Evreux? It's an air force base about 65 miles north of Paris. And I'll Tell ya, that's a lucky break for us. Well considering. Speaking of lucky breaks, just a couple of miles to go to the euro tunnel. Ok I'm calling the kids again. Damn. Oh no. It's too late. It's already been abandoned. Maybe not. Let's check around back. See. Somebody must still be here. I don't know. It look pretty dead to me. Ok. Worst case scenario.. It's warmer in there then it is out here. Maybe there's supplies. A working phone. If all that Fails we climb to the top and use your phone. Ok, for the record... Duly noted. C'mon. Hello. Hello. We're Americans. We need help. Which way? I don't know. That way? No. Ok, how about that way? No. Ok, that way? No. Taryn? What? It's dirty. It's creepy. It looks like it's going to fall apart any second. Look at the bright side. What bright side? Let's just go that way. Hello. Hello. At least they have power. Look at the lights. Yeah sure. This isn't creepy at all. All we need is a scratching sound and a little girl in the corner singing ring around the Rosie Ryan! Where are you? Taryn! Taryn! Call down I'm right here. There's a light at the end of the hallway. They must have emergency power. Let's go check it out. Oh god what a mess. It's dead. What are you doing? Looking for something useful. Maybe someone left a hat or a jacket, or something. Let's head up to the room. Maybe your cellphone will get a signal. You crazy. I'm not going up to the roof. We are just looking for... You are an american. Who are you? I'm Ryan foster, this my sister Taryn, her dad is major Steve foster. Us air force. But we can't get a hold of him, and our house got destroyed. And we're freezing and we figured The best place would be the us embassy. Yeah sorry to let you down but this place has been red tagged. Everyone left 15 minutes ago. We set up a red cross station at the Louvre. I don't even know how you guys got in here. Probably the security left with them too, Crap. I got to get outta here and you too it's not safe here. No no no, wait wait wait. Do you have any jackets or coat, or something for us? The red cross has all that for you. No I mean we are talking about right now. We're freezing. I can't help you. Is your phone working? No. Look we gotta go. I just came back for these files, and I have them. We have to go. C'mon. But I can't go out like this. Look it's better to be outside then inside. You don't have to Worry about things falling in your head. C'mon! Let's go. Hey wait! Move your asses. Hey! We don't know where we're going. I think we are suppose to stand on the doorway. Oh! This is stupid. Let's go. Whoa! You all right? I don't think I broke anything. How are you? Yeah. Lucky I landed on you. Ryan, kicking it is not gonna open it. It has a metal door. It must be some kind of vault or something. Alright then we climb out. Ryan? Don't tell me we're trapped down here. We're not trapped down here. Yeah but is that true? That's what I'm working on. We gotta get out of here. Ok. I'm going to boost you up ok? Just step right here. Boost up, you climb out, and just go. And the what? You get outta the building as fast as you can before it comes down. Yeah but what about you? We'll figure something out? We'll figure something out? What do you mean we'll figure something out? What are you gonna do? Climb up? Jump up? Light a bat signal? We have to get out of here. That's what I'm talking about! Let's go! Come on! I'm not leaving you. Taryn, just go. Alright? Get out of the building. I'll be right behind you. You will not. Don't lie to me Ryan. What do you want me to do Taryn? If we stay here we die. Alright, get out of here. Save yourself. You're out of your freaken mind if you think I'm going to leave you here. What am I going to tell dad? I'm gonna climb up and figure something out. I'll come back and get you ok? I'll be right back. Ok? I'll be right here. Hey I found something. Great, a latter? Ok just stand in the corner I'm going to drop this down, ok? Perfect. Do you have the other end tied to something? Give me a second. I'm all set. You sure? Yeah. Thank god. oh my god. We gotta get outta here. C'mon. Help! Help! Somebody help! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! What happened? You've been electrocuted. You're going to be alright. I don't know how to work this thing. What do I do with this thing? I don't know what to do? Help! Help somebody! Help me! What happened? I don't know. He's had a million volts of electricity. He's been electrocuted. Please. Put those back. Put those back! Ok ok don't yell at me. I gotta check his heart beat... It's there but it's irregular. Clear Ryan! I thought you left. No no the tremor hit me in the head, knocked me out and the screaming woke me up. Can you walk? Ryan! Come on. You ok? You ok? Ok we gotta go. C'mon. Hey! Wait, now where? The Louvre. If he was right about the red cross that's where they'll be. Where is it? Union river. By the pound north. What's up? We're not gonna make it, we're not gonna make it. I'm going to talk to this guy. Excuse me I have a reservation. Departure hanger? What's that? You can't board without a departure hanger. The machine is over there. Can you just check, it's Steve foster, foster, f- o-s-t. I can here you. I just don't care. I don't think you understand, colonel Dillard called Personally to make a reservation for me. If you have a reservation, you get your departure hanger over There. Not that it'll do any good. And why's that? They are hours behind. Those people where meant to be on the 9am. And they have been here all day. I hear that the next train might be the last because of the weather. I hear that the next train might be the last because of the weather. Steve! What the hell are you doing? We're not gonna get a pass, the whole system's falling apart and we're running Out of time. Let's try to use the service tunnel. Call the kids. Is that your phone? No way! It's still working? Yeah it's dad, hello dad, where are you guys, did you hear what happened? Taryn thank god, listen it's lacey. They alright? Uh, your father's busy driving are you ok?, is, is your brother with you? Is he safe? Ryan is here. We're fine. We're fine but the city is horrible. Ok listen everything's going to be fine, we have a plan. Ok, what's the plan? We need a place to rendezvous. Ok listen, we need a place we can find you, what do you see around you, what's nearby? Nothing. Nothing it's all gone. What are they asking? They need a place to meet us. The embassy? The tower. The Eiffel tower, it's still there. They say the Eiffel tower's still standing. Perfect, tell 'em to go to the tower and find a safe place to stay and look out for a Helicopter. We'll be there, it'll take some time but we'll get there. Corporal I'm major foster, us air force. I need access to the service tunnel. Sorry sir, this tunnel is for emergencies only. This is an emergency corporal, I need to get to France. So do all those people. My children are stranded in Paris corporal, I need to get to them. My mom's in Reykjavik. We haven't spoken since yesterday. I understand sir. What's the problem? He's not gonna let us through Look at that! When more people realize they won't get through. It's getting ugly out there. And it's only going to get worse We're running out of time. They're going to close this Tunnel and we're never going to get out of here. Ah the hell with it. Hold on. Alright, we're on our way. Whoo I'm freezing my ass off. We need coats. You're telling me. Hey look, best case scenario. They're not gonna be here for another 3 hours, probably more. Yeah. So why don't we go find coats and somewhere warm where we can rest a while. Ok but I don't want to want to miss them at the tower. Neither do I. We get pneumonia out here, we're not going to be doing anyone any favors. They're still in England, right? They have to find the helicopter where ever the hell That is. Then fly to Paris. It's gonna be a while. And it's cold. Ok. Where do you want to go? Uh, I don't know. This way? At least it's in the direction of the Louvre. What is it? What is it? What is it? The army is rounding up people probably for evacuation. Well that's a good thing right? Not if it stops us from getting to lacey and dad. Whatever is going on here. Staying at a refugee camp is not gonna save us ok? C'mon. Wait Ryan? The cold. It's freezing. I don't want to die out here in the streets. Here. Here. Let me think. Where are we? Avenue George. I know what we can do. What? Run to the Fourreur industries. C'mon. See. They actually teach you something useful in fashion school, huh. Let's go. I don't think there's anyone here. It doesn't look like there's anything here. I guess we are not the 1st people to think of Fourreur's would be a good stop huh. There's gotta be something. Hey. Maybe downstairs. There's gotta be a stock room or something right? We're going to shop. I'm not going back out there like this. Bingo. Here try this. Oh, better? Much. Oh, we got lucky. Relatively speaking. Of course you don't speak French. Typical Americans. We're sorry. We didn't think- You didn't think I'd mind being robbed. The lootters already took most of my coats. But you won't get these. Sir, please we don't meet any harm. We just- You know how it is out there. It's freezing. It's only getting colder. We need these coats. Then you buy them like anyone else. Ok yeah. Fine sure. How much? Price is determined by need. And your need is great. So the price is will be great also. I'd say... 20,000 euros. A piece. 20,000 euros? That's ridiculous. Yeah. Who's robbing who here? Please sir. Be reasonable. Leave my money or leave my coats. or leave both. We're making good time, as long as the roads ahead of us are as good as they were in England. And no more earthquakes. Don't jinx it. It's not the snow I'm so worried about, it's the wind. Steve. Right, my lips are sealed. This really is what you do isn't it? What's that? Keep cool in a crisis, rise to the challenge, find solutions. Well, that is what I was trained for, unfortunately I wasn't trained in raising a Family, but it's going to work this time I promise you, no it will work. Yeah it's gonna work. It's gonna work, I'll make sure it works. Australia will be the true test of that. All four of us livin' in a little tent together? Australia, I wonder what that's going to be like... I'll certainly get to know your kids. Yeah... I'm sure they found some place in Paris to get some cold weather gear. Yeah I'm sure. Knowing Taryn, she probably spent 3000 dollars on some skimpy little ski jacket. You know I think you're a much better father than you give yourself credit for. Well thanks. I'm sure they're just a couple of chips right off the old block. Well let's hope, right now our mission is to find 'em, make Sure they're safe and, get them out of Paris. Roger that major.. Look, easy here. Here take my credit card. Cash only. Mona mi. We don't have that kinda cash. Who would? Please just... We gotta get outta here. No. Taryn. Ryan! Ryan! Tyran! I'm trapped. I can't lift it. It's too heavy. Oh my god the ceiling! It's not gonna hold. Ryan hurry! You gotta get me out. Ryan! I'm going to go for some help, ok? Help? Where? Ryan, you can't leave me here. Tyran, I have to. I can't lift this by myself. We need help, ok? Look, I won't be a minute, alright? Ryan! Ryan, you can't leave me here. Just hang tight. I'll be right back, ok? I promise. Hey help! Help! Hey. Hey! Sir. You got to help me. Hey. It's you. My sister... Um she's downstairs, she's trapped. S'il vous plait. Please. Ryan, you didn't bring anybody? It's crazy out there but I brought this. I'm going to lift it up as high as I can. You run as fast as you can out, ok? Ok, do it! 1... 2... 3. Higher. I'm trying. Go. Go. Go. Ryan, thank you so much. Sorry I called you a pervert. that's the 1st thing you think of to apologize to me for? Shut up. Ok. Ouch! How bad is that? Damn these were 200 dollar jeans. Right but are ya gonna die of tetanus? It hurts but the cut is not that deep. I'll be fine. Ok, good. We need to get a cross the sea. The tower is on the rive droite. Wow Ryan. That's impressive. No not really. That's the only bit of French I've learned since I've been here. That and "it's ok I'm a doctor." Alright. Well let's find somewhere warm and dry until they get here. Yeah. I could so go for a nice cup of coffee right now. Mmm coffee. How about a hazelnut crepe? Chocolate a Claire? Foot rub? Sarcasm isn't helpful right now Taryn. Ana. Yes doctor? I want you to check my work. Sir. I think perhaps I've made a mistake because what I'm looking at here is unprecedented. I can't send it to NATO until I am sure it is correct. Of course Dr. Goldschein. Ana have you ever heard about uh an ice cyclone? Is there any record of such a thing? Not that I know of doctor. Well, check the figures. Otherwise I wouldn't want to think what an ice cyclone could do in a city like Paris. Was that an earthquake? Maybe just a passing tremor. Still, I'll feel safer when we're above sea level again. About ten minutes and we'll be up top. Just a few miles to go now. Then how far to Evreux? About two hours tops, depending on the road conditions. I wonder which is going to be worse, the main roads or the back. What was that? Was that another tremor? I don't know but I didn't like the sound of it. Another one, but, it's getting closer. What is that? Steve! Holy cow! What is that? That's the english chanel coming in. Just go!, just go. Go faster! I'm going fast, I git I I I got it at max! Look, its right in front of us you see it? Cmon cmon! No just, stay in the gah I see it I see it! Come on. Come on. It's coming in everywhere look at that! I see it. Look at that! It's getting closer to us! Honey I see it. Just keep going! Go, it's coming in behind us, it's getting closer, cmon! There's the exit! There's the exit! Brace yourself! Brace yourself! How many dead? Over a thousand. The trains were full to capacity. Over full. Well, I suppose that it's just a drop in the bucket compared to the millions are gonna Die before this is over. And it was the 1pm departure? that's the one I booked Steve on. he was a good man. Anyway. I might be able to do something for his children. Paris. They're evacuating Paris, aren't they? Yes sir. They've rounded up the survivors and put them in temporary shelters. Right. Download pictures of the kids. Send them to who ever is in charge. And see if they can get them here. But sir, why all this effort for 2 Americans? With all these sevilliance- Because I owe the man. He saved my life once. We flew together for years. E3 centuries, desert storm, and a lot of other operations. 95 we were in Alaska. Took off on a perfectly clear day and injested an entire flock Of Canada gees. The plane went down like a stone. Everyone on Board were killed or seriously wounded.. I was unconscious, Steve was wounded but he found me, pulled me out of the wreckage And carried me on his back 3 miles back to headquarters. We don't forget things like that. There is a chance they made it through before the quake of course. Yes. Yes you are quite right. He might have. Alright, I'll try to get him on his c- But 1st sir, did you get a chance to look at Goldschein revised model? No no. I've been dealing with operational matters. What now? Oh my god. This is like a sick joke. If I said our luck was holdin' up would you consider that a jinx? Well yeah, but now it's too late. Well we are ahead of schedule. Oh Dillards calling back Hello? Colonel Dillard? Hello, Steve? Steve this is Dillard. Um, uh, this is lacey foster, Steves wife. I can't understand what you're staying. Hello? Colonel, I think that's you, we are in France, a couple of hours from Evreux. I can't hear you. Listen there has been a change of plan. Paris is unsafe. Don't go to Paris. Storm coming. Hello? Colonel Dillard? the kids... Are directly... Danger... Now, I will arrange to have the kids picked up. If you can get to Evreux, the helicopter... I can't, something about a storm and the kids and Evreux, and... I don't know. Look, I hope you understand this message. Colonel, can you hear me? Can you repeat? Can't understand a word you're saying. Got to go now. god bless. Uh lost the signal. Now what? We'll have to just stick to the plan that's all we can do. This part of the city seems quiet. It must have been evacuated already. Hey. There's gotta be an unlocked door somewhere around here. If we can get inside someplace, preferably someplace with food and power we outta be Safe and warm until it's time to meet up with dad and lacey. Ok, breaking and entering, great plan Ryan, great. You wanna be law abiding or you wanna be warm? Come on, come on come on. Damn he saw us. Where are we gonna go. We can't run. He'd follow, probably call others, we'd just get further away from the Tower, uh, maybe we can reason with him? He doesn't sound too reasonable, He doesn't look that reasonable either. Look Ryan, we don't know this guy, we don't know where he would take us. Dad is risking everything to be at the tower, we need to be there when he arrives. You're right c'mon!. Alright easy, easy, look we don't mean any harm. American? You need to come with me. Everyone is being evacuated. We have shelter Outside the city with food and medical supplies. No we can't do that we're meeting our parents at the Eiffel tower. No no, you come with me. Your parents are probably in the shelter already. No, no, no. You don't understand our parents... No you don't understand. A national disaster has occurred. We need to get everyone to A place of safety. Safety? Where? This isn't just some storm, don't you get it? I am not asking. Come with me now. Look we can't we're sorry. I have my order and now you have yours. You come with me for your own safety. Alright alright just don't shoot us for our own safety. Get back, get in. Hey. Angelique. Really? How much further? Ten or twelve miles. Are we good on gas? Oh yeah we're doing great. Alrighty then. Nap time. Whoa, you alright?! That wind came out of nowhere - must be 60/70 miles an hour! Well what can we do? We might have to pull over until it passes. Can we spare the time? Not really but... We might not have a choice. Argh, argh. Oh Steve! Hold on! You alright? Yeah. You? Yeah. Yeah... Ok. Oh come on. looks like we're on foot from here soldier. Oh foot? yeah. It's alright. It's only a couple miles. Ha, a couple miles. Yeah. How are we gonna find the base? It's fine. I have all the coordinates in the GPS on my watch. Ready for a little hike soldier? Sure. Come on. Let's get the gear. There you go, Southwest. This way. You will see. The shelter is probably the best place for you to be. Most likely your parents are already there waiting for you. Sir, we know you're just trying to do your job but we really need to get to the tower, ok. Our parents are coming in from out of town. No one is coming in from out of town, mister. Of that I can assure you. Our dad is an air force pilot. Or use to be. And is sending a helicopter to pick us up. You need to let us go. I am sorry mad' masel but... Look out! Oh my god. Everyone alright? Yeah I'm fine. Is he alright? I don't think so. Hey! Oh my god, we're stuck! He's got them on safety lock. Do you smell that? Gasoline. Oh my god, it's leaking! Quick, we gotta get out of here. Come on. Come on! What about her? you ok? I'm a little dizzy. Hey. Hey. We need to get out of here. Where? The Eiffel tower. The Eiffel tower. Short cut. Come come. Can we rest for a second, it's been hours. C'mon honey we gotta keep moving, we gotta keep the blood circulating. My legs are on fire, but the rest of me's numb with cold. We gotta keep movin' honey c'mon. Oh! Here, lacey We're here! What really, oh I can't believe it. And still on schedule! Don't jinx it, cmon. Steve! Steve! Lacey! Well, it beats walking. You alright? yeah It's creepy, there's nobody here. Let's hope someone's still here. Hello! Hello! Anybody here?! Colonel Dillard sent us! Foster! Over here. Yeah! C'mon, get in! Lieutenant Carl Redding sir, glad you made it. Thank you Lt. This is my wife lacey. Well now that you're here why don't we get the hell out? Good idea, I'll get the doors and you start her up! Well actually, I heard you're a hell of a pilot, why I don't I Get these doors and you fire it up! You got it! Main rotter. Clear Throttle. Open Starter. Engaging Oil pressure 10% n1, I should go help him. Thanks. Main rotter? Turning by 25%. Starter. Ignition at 58%. Oh! I'm ok. He needs my help again. We need to make up for lost time. Oh. Good job. How long until dad and lacey get here? Honestly it could be any time. They still have to get the helicopter. I really hope we don't miss them at the tower. That would really suck. We're not gonna miss them. We are making good time. Ok, well we don't need any distractions. She's the one that knew where the tunnel was. Geez, we couldn't have left her back there. That would be like murder. It's getting worse by the minute. Stop! Nice bike. We'll take that. You can't take our... Nobody said you could speak. Understand? Yeah. I understand. Good. So... We'll take the bikes. And the coats too. What? You can't take the - Ryan. The coats! Now! Lady. Ryan. Don't look so sad. You're lucky you keep your shoes. Or should I take them too? No please. Kidding. Take off. No. Man, not another earthquake. Oh, this is getting' old. C'mon. Ce que se pasee?! I don't know! The water in the pipes? The water... It's freezing, it's causing the pipes to burst. Let's go. Hey! Taryn? You ok? Ryan! Oh my god. Damn it, it's locked. I'm gonna try the stairs let's go. This is really bad. I've never seen anything like this before. Can we get above it? I'm worried about navigation. Half the instruments are out as it is. But it's worth a try. Oh wow. We gotta get over that. Uh oh. Don't say uh oh. No uh oh. Main rotter warning. What? Dammit. Engine stall. Must be the ash. Are we gonna crash? Not if I can help it. We're falling. Honey, I got it under control. We're falling. Honey, I got it under control. I've trained for this exact scenario, alright? It's called an auto rotation. We keep the rotter angled. The blades spinning. We'll have a controlled decent. Understand? Yeah. I think so. Just got to give the engine time to recover. Are we gonna land? We might have to. Are we gonna crash? We might have too. Steve. Honey, it's ok. Steve! I'll try one more time. Just give the engine time to kick in. Are we dead? I don't think so. Did we crash? I don't think so. are we going to be ok? I think so honey. Next time we'll take a cruise. You got a deal. They did say they were coming in a helicopter, right? Where are they going to land? Not down there. Yeah and not here. Ryan, what are we gonna do? Maybe, maybe if we can find a way to get to the top they can drop a rope ladder or we can Find a way to climb on board... I don't know! You don't know? After all this we're just gonna die here? We would have been better off in a refugee camp Ryan. You know dad he's like freakin captain America, if anyone can pull this off he can. You still believe that, after all this, why do you idolize him so much? Because he's a hero! And I'd be lucky to be half the man he is. Well, he'd better not be late, otherwise he's grounded, for life. C'mon, a thousand more steps. oh, oh. I don't like the sound of that. C'mon t. This thing has been standing since 1889, it's not gonna fall over now. But it wasn't built to last. Have a little faith c'mon! You ok? Yeah you ok? Let's keep going. Ok, maybe we should head back down. Yeah. Okay, let's keep moving! Paris. Where's the tower? We would be able to see it if it wasn't for all these storm clouds and all these ashes. Oh, there it is. Steve. Let's just get there 1st and find the kids. One crisis at a time. Hey it's them. Really? I don't know it's a helicopter! Hey hey, over here. Come on kids, where are you? Do you see them? Dad. Dad. Maybe they are underneath it? Maybe, but it could be unstable down there. Hey hey, over here. Oh there Steve, Ryan Ryan! There is no way he can here you baby. Oh thank god! Incredible right?! Hey hey, hey! What the? Hurry hurry! I see it but I don't know what the hell it is. May be this is what Dillard was talking about. May be. All we can do is get there before it does. Read my mind. Ryan, if we don't make it out of here, I just want you to know. Yeah yeah yeah no I love you too t. No no no I mean I love you but I quit school. What?! When?! A couple months ago, I didn't want you to be disappointed in me You're so much like dad, in a good way. Hopefully that will be the worst news I get today. Dammit. I missed it. Try again. It's alright try again. Can you get any closer? I'm trying. What if the wind slams us right into that thing. T you ok? That freakin' hurt. I don't like this anymore Ryan.

Only an hour to get there. Are we gonna make it? We'll find out soon enough. Cornel how come we don't leave if everyone is here? Because not everyone is here. You're willing to risk all of our lives for people who may or may not make it on time? The storm is only getting worse. We should leave this minute. Who the hell are they anyway. We should get out of here. The plane leaves on time. Not a second before. Make final preparations for take off. Come on. Come on. Just 10 miles. We can make it. We can make it. All set sir. Departure on your command. Very well. There's the base. I think we are going to be ok. Don't jinx it. Don't be superstitious honey. Dad! Hold on. We're going down.
