He's too young for Diringas. Ok, fine, but we don't even know what that Diringas is. Nobody's supposed to know, till we find the right guy. It's totally unreal, totally new. And we're paid damn real money for that. Well, yes but we don't even know who we're looking for and why? What are we advertising? Listen kid, we know just what we need to know. We gotta create a new brand Diringas. For this we need an absolutely new guy. Don't give me a bunch of idiots. I don't need a lot. Just The One. Yeah, this one's no good. Ok, thanks, we'll call you back! The last one. - What's he doing here? - What's wrong? He's from "Golden Decisions"! - From where? - Our competitors. You work for Diana, don't you? I'm an actor. A freelance actor. No good. But we haven't got anyone else... So keep on searching. This one's no good. - But I can't just tell him that straight away. - So tell him to do something. Do something. What exactly? Well, something you can. Tell him thanks. Ok, thanks! Thanks, enough. We'll call you. Alright. Vytis? How are things there, I'm a little late. What?! Don't even think of starting without me! Vytis! - Excuse me, do you start counting as we move? - No. - So when? - Already counting. Ok, let's go! We're kinda late... Yura, stop it, you'll mess me up. - Yura, we're being watched. - Even better. - Know how much this"taxi" costs? - The more so. Yura, I told you... - And don't call me"babe"against others. - Babe against others? And don't talk shit. Yes, yes, of course. Tomorrow it is then. Maybe it's better off the phone cause... Well, you know. Certainly. Absolutely. We'll do. Stump. Max looking for the guy? Any news? Don't get drunk. Tomorrow they want to see the idea, scenario and The Guy. Got it? I'll... everything... Don't flounce. And don't lick my ass tonight, ok? Good evening! Good evening! Good evening to everybody! The"Golden Decisions"agency welcomes you to our first birthday party. Thank you. Advertising is a dynamic business. And one year in it is totally a lot. Therefore we are not afraid to boast about our young company's professional achievements. So on this occasion we congratulate you all! Look at those fags. I wonder where's Diana? You really wonder? ...In "Golden Decisions" one year anniversary! - What's going on here? - What's the problem? - Why are you rolling up the carpet? - The official part's over. I am the official part. Dunno, I work according to the hours. Official part's over. It's ok. Let's go. Hi, long time no see... Oh hi, how are you? Colossally, totally, with a hyper-explicated epic! I see no point in proving something here. You just gotta see. That's unreal... What's going on here? Oh. Diana! What's this disco for, I was supposed to speak! Diana, no need to dramatize things. You were late, people were waiting. We saved the situation. The presentation was very professional. It was me who had to speak. Get it? I do but you can't do it again. Will look shitty! - You're the one who looks shitty. - What? - Naglis, how did the people react? - Fine, cool... Diana, you're overstressed... Good evening! I am really glad to see you all here tonight. On this occasion! And now a few words from our beloved Diana. Come on, babe. To wade into the same river's better than not to wade at all. What river? What babe? The fuck's he saying? - Who's that? - No idea. Came with Diana... From her office? Thanks. Happy birthday to you... Thank you. Good evening! Advertising is a dynamic business. Our young agency joined it exactly one year ago. One year may seem not much anywhere but advertising. The brand new world of images and contemporary icons. Good evening. Ilona. - Nice name, Ilona. - Thank you. And you are? Yura. - Nice to meet you. - Nice perfume. - Thank you. I'm from an advertising agency. - Wow... That's cool. And you're a DJ, right? Oh, sorry... And what are you, I mean, what do you... What do I do? Diringas. - Pardon? - Diringas. Oh, Laimonas! Good evening. - Laimonas Dilde. - Yura. - Haven't we met before? - Maybe. Where do you hang out? Well... yes, of course... So, you're a real professional, aren't you? - Ilona and I are close friends... - Sure. If you'll excuse us. - Who's he? - Can't I have a natter? What did you natter about? Are you nuts? Should I just stop talking to people? - We said nothing, he's weird. - What's his business? - Some kind of Diringas... - What? Look, there was nothing between us. Repeat what he said. He said about Diringas or something. I don't know... What's wrong? Don't disappear. - Excuse me, can I ask you something? - Sure. Are you working with "Golden Decisions"? - Wouldn't say so. - But in principle? Not with all of them. And your main field is? Diringas. Interesting field... Especially when I own an advertising agency myself. By the way, what category would you class your brand to? What's a brand? Well, everything's some kind of brand... Diringas is more than a brand. - So who does it belong to? - Me. ...and the"Golden Decisions" wishes you a nice evening! I'll see you later. Don't get bored! - Diana! - Hey, Cleo! Congratulations, Diana, spectacular speech! Thanks, Cleo. How's your show? Oh you know each one's a bomb. - Went to Milan for a week again. - Milan! Always fascinating! - Who's he? - What do you mean? Oh, Yura. Come on, we barely know each other. Where did you find him? - In a casino. - Again? I played some roulette. You know, to relax. And he was so adventurous... - Good evening. Happy anniversary! - Hi Laimonas. How's everything? Fine, thanks. A successful speech. - I was so damn nervous... - She shouldn't have, right? Hi, Cleo. How's business? It's ok, moving. How'bout yourself? Fine, thanks. Doing anything new? This 'n'that... - Diringas? - What? I met Yura. We spoke about Diringas. What exactly? Well, he didn't give me the details... - What details? - We didn't speak about a specific project. You and Yura are into some project? We're not. And you? - And we what? - Excuse me, what's that Diringas? Indeed, how would you put it? Why me? What do I know? Some kind of new brand? Or maybe it's more than a brand? See you! What's that Diringas? How can I know? You know Dilde always trying to strike me. Let's go, I'll introduce you to Yura. Fucking mule! - Who? - The executive. Dilde! Can't fuck off even here, that monkey. Let's get drunk tonight. Let's get drunk like dunno what... Calm down, Stump. Tomas! I'm Tomas. It's not because of money. Money sucks! I'm the man of principles. Of fucking principles! You agree? Get sober, we're going to the studio. You can drink there. - But we're all set... - Told you in the studio. - Alright, fine. - Nothing's fine. We must get chicks, drinks, other crap. Right now. I'm very serious. Got it? Hurry up! Call Max and tell him we need to photo one guy. Which one? The one with the cake. Cool. Who is he? Fuck knows... But he knows about Diringas. How? Isn't he from "Golden Decisions"? Either Diana's fucking my mind, or I understand nothing. - Seen Ilona? - Yeah yeah, somewhere there. Let's go! Take more, can't be any shortage. Max call everyone, that's it! Wait. Come here. Laimonas Dilde? How's the party? It's ok, ok... Just a little out of steam. Sucks, so to say it. What's out of steam? The party. I've got an offer. If you don't mind... You see, I'm throwing my own party tonight. Exceptional people only. Stylish atmosphere. What do you think? We could extend our acquaintance... I guess you, won't reject it, Ilona... So, what do you say? Mainstream everywhere! Flat mainstream! She owns the office. But that's not enough for image making. You need an exclusive strategy! You need a vision! Girls! For the vision! I'm telling her: girl... Oh, Diana... - Have you seen Yura? - What Yura? Only us here. A beer. Small. No, maybe water. - So perhaps I will... - Certainly. I mean, the good news is that the situation is really favorable for you. The world's changing radically and... you are creating a totally new phenomenon. As you have said, there has been no precedent. You'll be the first. And a new image creating method is very important for my agency. As you've said, Diringas is an absolutely universal system... It's Diringas. A very modern look at an image. The consumer will relate it with the most attractive way of life. Diringas guarantees absolute success for your company. - More precisely? - More precisely. Yes. Of course. - Stump? - What? I'm sorry, it's my mistake... Great. Tomorrow we're waiting for the results. - But, you mean he's... - Perfect. - So, how'bout a beer to our luck? - Check, please. Hi, Laimonas, where did you go yesterday? Is Yura with you? - Yes, Yura's with us. - With "us" where? - At work. - What? What do you mean? He is working. - Bullshit, I'm serious. - I'm not joking. He's our new partner. Oh, your partner! And what are you doing with him? Diringas. - What Diringas? What is this Diringas stuff? - As I've understood, you're not interested. - But I'm interested in Yura. - But"advertising is a dynamic business". - What are you doing here? - The same as you. You're supposed to be with clients. Vytis! - What? Oh, yeah... - You're totally messed! It's not what it seems. No need to hypertrophize the situation. I can see how it seems! Did you prepare anything yesterday? - Yeah. - What? Our presentation. - Drunk faggots. - Please. Please, get your asses to the office and I'm going to the clients. Got it? Ain't going anywhere, you hooker! Oh, so you... We'll come later then, excuse us. We get up and we go to bed with this word. If necessary, tonight nobody sleeps at all. Clear? Yes, Max. Especially your team! Do not think about Diringas as a brand. It's more than a brand. It's a super brand. It's a hyper brand. A brand of life. So, everything's clear? Any questions? I guess not everyone here realizes how important this project is for us. I'll explain. It's gonna be a revolution in the market and also in our lives. These clients are unique and this project is a challenge for all of us. We've got to prove. Our future depends on that. In a word this is Diringas. What's the matter? Uhm... I mean, is it a brand or some kind of image? Do you know what a brand is? Well, yeah... But actually, more detailed information would really help... Ok. Max, fine. What else would you like to know? Specifically. Well... In general, what is this Diringas actually? Actually, Max, you're the director. Your concern's not what it is, but how it will look like. Your point is a video. A video that will make the clients shit their pants with joy tomorrow morning. As well as all the goofs in front of the box. We've got less than 24 hours. Are we waiting for something else? It will be done as if with a real camera. I mean, in documentary, reporting style, known as Dogma in the West. The clip will involve people from different social and age groups. Who will look like people interviewed in the streets or their workplaces. Yet they'll be actors, selected with particular care. So... And all this will be accompanied by innovative outdoor advertisements, where we could use real objects, as well as a radio show or even a CD. In the next step, we could consider a new clothes collection, that would provoke media's response, just like the outdoor ads... The campaign might seem untraditional, but advertising is a dynamic business... I mean, we need to use more and more sophisticated forms... - Diringas. - Pardon? Use Diringas. What's this? It's the face of Diringas. I think we'll do with Diringas. Thank you... I need it right now, Cleo! It's not only my interest! We're friends. I gotta suggest it to you! Your show will discover a brand new phenomenon. Diringas! Yes, today. Can't you do a bit earlier? Well at least... Cleo, you see... Cleo! Please understand! Stupid goose. Please, turn it down a bit. Hi Laimonas. Where are you? I'm coming to take Yura. - Maybe you shouldn't. - Ok, quit it! I need him right now! What for? Just tell me where to go. What? Hello?! Turn off this shit! What? Where? What are you monkeying about? - I'm an actor, Vytis... - Naglis, you're a brilliant actor. But this was our competitors'casting, do you realize that? Do you remember when we last made a commercial? I crave for artistic expression. I will die in this fucking office. As an artist, I mean. Everything's cool. Will be cool, when we get that bitch off our necks. - Yeah right... - Yeah, right. I've got the strategy and the whole view of the situation. Business intuition... And Diana? - Diana's got clients. - What?! She's not even telling us about new clients or project. Wanna know why? Cause she's got no clue. She's just a pretentious goof! What was you name, you said? Gerutis. Nice muscles, Gerutis... Want some champ? - Good morning. How are you? - You never know. That's for me? - What's gonna be here? - We're gonna shoot a video. Nice. I'm not disturbing, am I? Absolutely not. You're gonna be in it. - Be in what? - This is Diringas. Your Diringas. - Oh, so we're gonna shoot a video! - Yeah! So, it fits? Maybe you'd like something... to refresh. - Are we shooting right now? - As soon as the team is ready. Max, how long will it take? - This is our director. - The most important one... You're the most important here, Yura. - Thanks, Laimonas. I am what I am. - Right. No doubt. So... So maybe you'll give us some support in the beginning, Laimonas? So, you and Max can prepare for the shooting... We'll be right back. Come here Stump. Listen, hero, slow down a bit, ok? - I didn't... - And I did... I'm doing everything for our success. So what if you move your ass too? Ok? I gotta run out a bit. It's important. Ok? So. I gotta do a couple of things... Will you make it without me? Easy man! So we, like, set the lights and wait for Dilde or what? Set the lights and start. - Like... Without him? - Yeah. Without him. - What's up? - Nothing. Let's do it. Ok. Vytis, Naglis, here's what we'll do. Yesterday we lost him, today we must get him back. Otherwise things won't move. Where are the magnets?! Can I pour some for you? Want some? Oh, you can't talk. Ok. But I don't have a light. What's next? Maybe we can involve Ilona somehow? - Are you nuts? - What do you suggest? Well, we gotta provoke him, ask questions, make it look real. - Got the questions? - Well... So, stop then! No no! Dilde told to shoot everything! - What everything? - Well... - Maybe he needs some back light? - What?! Light up from the back a little. Some back light, as you say. So, if you don't mind, I'll... Vytis, it's too dangerous. Maybe we should try other way? - Shitting your pants? - Of course not. Naglis, it's our chance. Just don't fuck it up. - Ok, but what about Diana? - Obsecive workaholic, with an IQ of fish. - And P.H. as well. - What? P. H... We're creators, not some call-boys. Naglis, put this thing away. Alright? Give it to me... - I'll take care of it. Keep driving. - She'll piss me off. Fucking piss me off! She already did. No vision, no strategy! We cannot even use these categories here. How that fucker became a strategic object? "Yura's not only the essence of the project but of the whole agency." Can she be any dumber? Huh? Vytis, she's a total zero without us. We'll leave her "Golden Decisions", then she'll realize what she's doing. How does this thing work? She understands nothing. I told you already she's a total zero. The agency needs constructive aggression. It needs another person. A pro. Put away this shit! Give it to me... Sorry Vytis... somehow it... Father will castrate me for this fucking car! - How're you doing, Yura? - Chin's up. Could you comment on that? That means - incredibly good. What about yourself, Stump? Ilona, would you also like to ask something? Why? What would you like the most now? - Shoot, we'll edit it somehow. - Edit what? We're not recording sound. So record it. And what would you like the most now, Max? Just keep shooting. - Me? Well... it was Stump's question. - Tomas. Are you bored? Just keep shooting. No, I'm interested. You? I've asked you too. Answer him. Yes... Interested in what? What d'you mean? You say you're interested. I'm asking - in what? Well... Shooting and... stuff... You like shooting me sitting and smoking? What about Ilona? Aren't you tired? Let me hold it. A little. It seemed lighter. Ilona! How are you? So, Max, what's more interesting me smoking a cigar or Ilona drinking water? C'mon Ilona, do it! Give me some fire! You haven't answered, Max. I don't quite get you... You can tell us, Max! - Yes. - What was that? Well... Yes... I don't know... - Can I go on? - Of course, Yura. Can you film me and Ilona a bit? Look here, Max! Max, this is some porn! Enough! Cut! I'm the one who says "cut" here, Stump! Wanna kick my ass? He wanna kick my ass. Ilona! First, you're a total zero. That's a priori and deductively - your boss is my father. And I communicate with him in person, no intermediators. And this is your boss'son's colleague! Do you get it? - What? - Vytis, it's in the car. I'll be right back. I think I left it. Maybe we should go now... Ok, ladies, time to go. The faster the better to your asses. The fuck are you sayin', gorilla? I came to my father! You're fucking this meat. You're working for Diana. You ain't his son anymore. Goodbye, miss Vytis. You baby piss off as well. The keys! What are we gonna do, Vytis? Hello. Yes yes, it's already going on... Like we arranged... Yura's in a good shape. Our choice has once again proved to be correct... Certainly, tomorrow you'll see the final result... Excuse me? Now? Yes, sure, always welcome! Do you know the address? Thank you. Looking forward to see you. - What's up, Vytis? I'm in television. - Diana, we've got some troubles here... What exactly? Is Yura with you? As we arrived at the location, a slight confusion was formed. I'm asking - is Yura with you? - The object is under maximum fortification... - Cut this shit! Tell me clearly. - Gerutis'gangs hooked us. - What gangs? Where are you? Anyway, you can't get to Yura. But we've got a better idea. Repeat. - Well... Let's change the character... - What?! I mean, let's leave the concept - Diringas, but replace Yura with Naglis... Fags! Yura is that concept! We need him. Move! - Cleo, you gotta help me. - Diana, how did you get here? Doesn't matter. Cleo, it's very important to you as well. Diringas. It's gonna be a bomb of your new show! What? Diana, you're my best friend. Right? But we're both professionals. You know, business is business. So, you don't have this project. And I cannot let the event go away. That's how I make my living. - What do you mean? - Diringas belongs to Dilde. - Diana, be a professional! - I'm going with you. - Cut! - Stop! Once again! What's going on here, Stump? Diringas. Your Diringas. No. Our Diringas. Can't you see? Any suggestions? Or you've nothing to say? Where are your decisions when we gotta start everything? "Gotta leave, got some business to do..." Stump will fuck with all the problems! Am I wrong? TV crew's gonna be here in an hour. And the clients. They wanna see how things are going. Very well. They'll be impressed. Won't they, Gerutis? For sure, Yura. - You're out of here. - What? Get lost! Go, chill out a bit. Maybe you can tell me what's going on? Diringas. We're making a video. You interrupted us, Laimonas. Oh, that's just great, Yura! But can you tell me what's it about? I'd like to express my joy. The situation is really favorable for you. The world of advertising is changing radically. You've created a totally new idea. No precedent. You'll be the first. Diringas! Max will tell you my script. So. For instance, a question: Diringas is it a subculture or a contraculture? What? I don't think such word exists. No? Ok, then... Diringas is it a trend or a phenomenon? Well, I mean, the important is not the interview but his answers... Shit! Anyway, shoot Diringas and only him. No Dilde, no others. It shouldn't be clear that it's Dilde's studio. So, you mean I shouldn't talk to Yura at all? Focus on the essence. And let him speak to the camera all the time. And then... As you can see, the hero is attached to special constructions. So, he's flying in the air, making very delicate kung-fu movements. And that big guy, I mean, the villain is aiming a gun at him. The hero defeats the evil with a kick and then, sort of love scene. He catches the girl, they're flying, spinning around, kissing... - Here we need a close-up shot. - There will be a close-up. Yeah, absolutely... So, and then... The last shots, there's Diringas and... Everything is great. Thank you. I'll walk them out. What do you want? Hello, Daddy! You got nothing to say, then listen. If you wanna get your catafalque and your imbecile supervisor Stump back, make sure Yura stands by your studio in 20 min... Alone! And no gorillas. Clear?! Or you need a proof? Son? Suck my dick. - You're crying? What happened? - That homophobic scum called me a son. I see relationships... I'd like to help you, but I can't now... Imbecile! Faggot! Your business was to watch him. Stupid lump of meat! Let's go! I'm not here. Yura, you're ready? Everybody's ready? Let's go! Stop! What? - Oh, Cleo, what a pleasure... - Hello! I hope we're not disturbing? - Well, we're actually working at the moment... - Of course. Diringas? Diana! Come here! Hey, somebody let me down! I'm very interested in this new phenomenon... Diana, what are you doing here? So maybe we can start right now? Diana, come here! Diana... - Can I speak with you? - No problem. - Can we go outside? - Why? Anyone bothers you? - I don't know... - Are you ok? No interviews till the shooting's over. Diana, what exactly are you doing in here? I'm not here... Max, can we go on? Diana, make yourself comfortable somewhere. You're gonna shoot too? Very good! Shall we start, Max? Did you hear what was said? No interviews till the shooting's over. Just a couple of shots from here. Won't disturb anyone. Let'em shoot, it's even better for you. Focus, Gerutis. Alright, so... Step aside a bit then, find yourselves some place. Ok, so. How're you doing Yura? Ready? For sure, Laimonas. Alright! Everybody's ready? Camera's on? Let's go! Let's go! Action! Stop! What's wrong?! - What's up? - Empty. So? I shot... Ok, Break! Leave everything as it is! We'll repeat... We're gonna repeat it. I said break. Max! Go everybody! We need to discuss some things. Give us fifteen minutes... So maybe we can talk in the meantime... One moment. We'll just discuss certain things... I said later... Fifteen minute break! Get back! - Let me go! - What you wanna do? Get your hands off. He's alive? - Don't know, have a look. - No. Put that shit away and come here! Max, help me! Is he alive? - Cool down, ok? - What do you want? - Half. - Half? Of what? Of Diringas. Hey! Why so sad, you lonesome faggot?! Only close-ups with Ilona are not enough. What shall we do? I've come to my father... Hi, dad... Sorry... I brought your car... The other one, y'know... yours... Put them on, son. That's it. We did it, let's go! Hey, you're here? Let's go! Hey! Dad! - But... How? - You're gonna edit and present it. - But you can't do it this way... - You can't do it other way. Can you hear me? Let's go! We'll get caught! Let's go! We'll be fucked. Great. Just great. Yes. A very good solution. It's the real Diringas. Everything's so alive... Yes. Very good. Yes, indeed, speaking about this project... I think the director would like to introduce certain aspects. - If we were to resume everything abstractly... - Vytis, let the director finish his thought. I think we should start with the video itself. We've already seen it. We've just finished, so, you see... Max is a little bit... We understand you very well. - Is everything all right? - Yes, of course... So perhaps we should go straight to the point? - What about you, Miss Diana? - What? Pardon? You're ok too? Well... I tend to share all the responsibility related with this project... Very nice. We understand the difficulty of the job you had to do. Diringas. Professional. Very professional. We're glad... Is there anything? No, no. The work is great indeed. Well then... In this case we only have to discuss what's left. Ok. Let's discuss it. So, thank you everybody. Oh, no! Let them stay. Please, sit down... So... Then we would actually... I mean, we should... we would like to... Yes, yes, we understand. It was very nice of you to unite. Yes. As we have arranged... We were... The budget was really... Small? Well, no... Uhm... yeah... Small. I see. It is reasonable. We are not robbers. Pardon? We'd like to get the money now. In cash. And let's not waste the time. Excuse me, I don't quite get it. So, call Yura he'll explain better. I don't think we should disturb Yura. He must be deadly tired after the shooting... And we do understand it perfectly well... Or maybe, Mr. Dilde, you do not? And You, Miss"Golden Decisions," you don't understand it as well? But what exactly are we talking about? What do I've to do with this? Bullshit... No one is leaving. Sit down! I'm really sorry Miss. Your part was really fascinating. But I can't... I don't have that much... I've nothing... Excuse me? See for yourself. I have nothing... Unless Diana... She owes me... Let's go to the bank then. I've got nothing in bank either. I swear I'm all in debts. Everything's on credit. Can show you the papers... - I swear I'm the victim myself! I didn't... - Young man! - Is that all? - I told you... I'm almost bankrupt... I could demand from Diana or you could yourselves... The keys. - What keys? - Of your car. No... And the documents. Please don't. It's been a pleasure. Hope you'll be reasonable. Thank you. Good bye! Well... A small beer. Two. Well, I don't know... Well, it's quite interesting... But I don't know... Of course, we can try... Cause it's, uhm, you know... But actually... Though...
