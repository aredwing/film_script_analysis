Out of respect for our prophet, his name Mehmet. The name I gave him, let God decide his fate. Sandzak Saruhan I told you that there will ever beat you Hassan. And I've told you that this will be my happiest day. Received a letter from Khalil Pasha of Adrianople. Mehmet was more like 12 years mount the throne. / i Due to the political struggle between the viziers and beys, Sultan Murat II ... / i And after he died much beloved son Alattin, the profound sadness ... / i gave up power and Mehmed ascended the throne. / i But Chief Vizier Halil Pasha, concerns that the Crusaders will take in the Ottoman lands, Murad II returned to power. / i Mehmed was removed from the throne and was sent to Saruhan Sanjak. / i He had strong hands, capturing cities, armies crush ... Not one time did not showered me. He had a keen eye, he saw the future of the state. Not once, not looked at me with love. How much I loved you never saw. My heart beats to kiss the ground on which it was based. From that day on, my heart will beat to take over land on which you could not set foot Dad! To find out great country! Why did not my father viziers are far from me? Worthy of your status, stand by me. After five years, I returned to the throne deserved. What do you say, Halil Pasha? Then, you were very young Lord. Crusaders had crossed the Danube to expel us from Rumelia. We asked your father to return to the throne. Whatever we did was for the state. If you think we made a mistake, our life is yours. I believe so, for the good of the country they proclaim as chief vizier. Shahabettin, Zaurus and Saradzha Viziers will be too. CONSTANTINOPLE / i Murat Bey died Supreme Emperor! Sultan Mehmed, the second time was on the throne. I see that as me and you make you happy this news. I'm not happy emperor. Grand Duke is afraid that her son and his father will tried to besiege our city, as I understand. Remember why Murat Bey gave up the siege last time. That proclaim him as the Sultan is very even. Pathetic successor. Now we have a strong candidate for the Sultan shehzade (Prince) Orhan. Excuse me, but that dreams are meaningless. The only desire is to Sultan Mehmed destroy our empire. To get into town, he studied engineering sciences. To understand our weak traits learn our language. Also religion. It may be young but he is antichrist himself! Grand Duke Notares, stop worrying. Mehmed was deposed before. His reputation among the people is low. Prior to his throne rejoice not, will show him his power, not fear. Send Envoy to consult Odrin.Mehmed our peaceful policy. Do not be older by all! Learning-Sultan to hold a sword and you don 'was reflected Hasan! Come and sit down. I'm afraid of you know, what government? Who will teach him? Vladetelstvoto is in the soul, or has it or not. Murat Bay, this was it? In Varna, in Kosovo we are together. For it is not an eye, a thousand eyes if I could I would give! A Mehmed .... Do so, Master! He was only 12 when I mount the throne. Nobody cares. Go, toppled him? They took it. Everybody knows that. In its place if the doll came to Byzantium, Orhan traitor, happier you would be? Without knowing it, talking. Someday I will be ashamed of those words. Sultan Mehmed is determined to finish, what his father failed. His next goal is Rom. doubt this. Emperor Constantine must accept the agreement adopted in Florence to join the church. Thus, if we need to do, and pressure. True is, from these faithless Turks, a greater threat may not have. You can use bezopitnostta Mehmed to get rid forever by the Ottomans. Constantinople is a Muslim or capital, or Catholic. I do not think that Mehmet is smarter or bolder than his father. But we must consider all possibilities. We can not leave Constantinople to the faithless! God is on our side. You're right, made chief Vizier Halil Pasha. Not even the power to evict the man who ousted him. We must take advantage of this Ilyaz Bay. To send news to others. Time to get rid of the Ottomans. Thanks for the nice words Imprerator Constantine, for my father. And Orhan ... Emperor you want to increase payments to Orhan 300,000. For us it is important to live in a reputable environment. We will release an order. Tell Impratora you that his desire friendship will be accepted by us. Do you believe in the sincerity of Constantine? Can not exceed either the strength or courage, Lord. Contact Latin, Hungarian and Serbian rulers also with the Pope. Tell them that and they want to live in peace. As you wish Lord. You are free. Zanos Shaadettin and grazing, you stay. I see that the decisions that I made you disappointed. We should question the decisions of the Sultan. But before you issued the command, if you ask our opinion. Then we'll say the words. For the future of our country, there is no greater purpose than conquest of Constantinople. Before you eliminate your way to victory, we must be patient. Mother, I miss my father. Not his father, Sultan. How do you say? My sultan. Sultan, I know that in everything you do has a wisdom. To ascend again Khalil Pasha as chief vizier and relationships Byzantium created disappointment among the people. They give it as a vulnerability. I'm concerned, if not win the confidence of the army and the people If you do not feel under your power, we can have big problems. Power is not a demonstration of power to the people Zanos. To protecting the interests of the people, prosperity and build their future. And that's what makes a great Sultan. Do not worry, its time and my people and my army will understand why I have decided that now. Checkmate. Welcome, Gulbahar Hatun. It was a long journey, Lord. But you see, it was worth. Yes, Dad! My sultan! Lack many of your son shehzade Bayazat. Even in their dreams repeat your name. Go to rest. Port of Genoa, Italy / i Age! Not least I would have missed. I saw time with the File Type duke, but I could not convince him. Not at all interested in your sketches, unfortunately. I expected it. He told me if your father accepted you will immediately open a workshop. You know my father will not accept it. I know. I said the Duke. Thank you for everything. I owe you. Goodbye. Age! Stay here! Marry me. We will bring your father. And the duke will convince him of the time. Even going to help your father to open a shop. And before I tell you. To me will always stay as a valuable friend. And could not sleep. Why not asleep, son? Sultans do not you love the kids, Mom? What? As you grow you will see, how much they love you. My son! Mehmed! I am Osman. Turkish beylik found, those who came after me. Grandparents thy father, made it a huge country. You're the man who will turn this country a strong Empire Mehmed. This ring most you deserve it. Foreshadowed by our great prophet Conqueror Mehmed you! Be blessed! Sultan of mine! Are you okay? Or I'll take Constantinople, or he me! Issa Pasha command of the yard in Gelibolu make one hundred ships a year. Shaadettin grazing like three huge pots to make. Immediately, my Lord. Khalil Pasha, I extended report enicherskiya weapons status. -Commanded. If you allow, what is this? To join Anatolia to Rumelia and creating of a vast empire Khalil Pasha. I understand the hint, but I fear that we want to expand, we can also disappear. To stay in one place is like death to my people must take bold decisions. The teacher taught me something once, "To write history is not for cowards." Leave it in place! Stay not run! Get him! Many apologies. Where is the boy? Where is the bastard? Let's run! How was your trip? Without you, it was nice. But it was not bad. There was a storm at one time. -Really? I found the book you wanted. Tell what Duke said? Not interested in sketches our Dad. Not understand their value. He wants to pouring piece for his army. Just go to hell! Do not know that anyone weapons will not do more? Well how Justinian, what? One thing, however I ask your hand. And you refused him again right? Constantine gives Orhan dinner tonight after dinner to see. For our Turkish friends! Karamanoglu Ibrahim was in preparation for war with Sultan Mehmed. If there is strong support, who do you think will win, Shehzade Orhan? Naturally Karamanoglu. You do not just know we all think so. To sit on his throne hereditary, you should only one thing. Helping Karamanoglu Ibrahim Bey. I'm ready for anything! Write a letter to Karamanoglu that we, Hungarians, Latins, the pope are on his side. You promise to his land. If you do this, I will take responsibility to send them the letter. And the rest will sit down and watch with pleasure. The letter written by Orhan for Karamanoglu, my Sultan. Bravo! -Suppose that the second group delegates already arrived to Karamanoglu. Our plan worked, Karamanoglu Ibrahim started the uprising. The trap we fell. If Karamanoglu beat is sarsheno with him. It is not important whether you win, what matters is the army of Murad losing positions. And you can not resist us. It will also double money for Orhan of 600,000. You also will accept. By increasing my treasury, no reputation will completely evaporate. Beystvo Karamanoglu Akshehir 1451g. / I You Halil Pasha was on our side? Without his help, it is not possible to collect such an army! The letter was a big lie deceived us. -If we fight, victory is impossible. Karamanoglu Ibrahim, wanted peace! If we now leave it as soon as possible, it will be refunded! A country can not afford, if we fight with someone who wants peace our army will endure serious damage. Accept the proposal from Lord! Nonsense! Your political understanding is based a cowardly act! And I'm on the side of the Vizier, I think you will not find courage to recover soon. When marshirovame to Constantinople, it will not be an obstacle. Go! Send this hypocrite here. Take it inside. Stand up. Do not Forget! War with everyone, but peace with decent people do! I swear on my pride while I'm alive will not shed blood between us! I swear on the pride that will carry the end of his days. Or your death will be my hands. Who knows? Maybe your destiny is one. My Sultan! -Read. Constantine wants to double the money we pay for Orhan, Lord. There is no reason to do this. But neither the place nor the time! He wants to take advantage of our campaign! Get out! Lala (gl.vezir) you stay. You also friendly behavior, otherwise attributed to him? You neither strength nor courage lack? Is that what you understand by friendship Lala? Is this? Come here! Before the march fell into my hands a letter to Orhan Ibrahim, read! I am surprised by the sentence to Orhan Ibrahim. "Chief Vizier Halil Pasha was also with me." But for now, must keep it secret. Allah is my witness! I have nothing to do with it! Throughout his life, no moment is not separated the way your father and you. In return we'll talk in Edirne more seriously in this tema.Svoboden her. With this letter, Mehmed Pasha, Halil pressed. / i wanted to remove his power over the Janissaries. / i When asked Janissaries arrogant money after it had been, / i he immediately used vozmozhnostta. / i and punished with the main battle Janissaries who people are the chief vizier. / i These dvulichnitsi send them into exile. As Lord-favored combination. Every blow they receive is actually for me. Karamanoglu was! Cowards! Surrendered without a fight. Sultan Mehmed saw that we mirolyubivostta fraud. It is no longer young. He won his first campaign. Be sure not to send even half the money for Orhan. Why still vainly blame? How can you write such a letter? With what audacity using my name? I am sure that the Sultan was aware of the lie. Even if not, can not hurt. You can not afford internal problems in the state. Emine wrong, the state step by step, passing in his hands. Sultan Pasha has called you! Allah! At that time? This tradition in our state has one explanation. Go, fetch my shroud. Prayer, I am a witness that no god but Allah, I witness that no other prophet than Mohammed. Walk. Give him water. I never doubted your loyalty. If it were otherwise, I would take your head. Surrender of Constantine, they would no longer pay. As you wish Lord. Come here. What do you see? -This is a fort built by Sultan Bayazid. Now what you see? New Fort in Rumelia Lord. Right here we will build the new fort. These two towers, your people will build. The first stone, the Byzantines, the Pope and all other will understand what we want to do Lord. Will join and will attack us. Neither Latins nor pope, nor Constantine ... I only think, for my people, who does not see opportunities like conquer Constantinople. Not ever going to shed blood, but whether it will be martyred, or vain? This is the question. Boazkesen April 1452g. / I Our Sultan! (Peaceful) Work! Came to our noses and build a fort! -You break the ships of the Black Sea. We'll make you starve! -Prepare for attack. We need to prepare for war. Tell my brothers. Collect armies and to come here. Tell Justinian if commanding my army will receive the island of Limnos. What was the name of the master piece? Urban-Lord. Make him finally to make cannons for us! You were right by building this fort, intentions Sultan Mehmed clarified. The Pope should take action if we collect strong army of crusaders, Mehmed will abandon the attack. So Constantine will sign the contract for not joining the Orthodox Church to the Vatican. But Frenchmen and Englishmen were at war, Their armies are worse condition. A German Emperor has internal problems to the throne. Sultan Mehmed knows it all. Planned on it that is Yes, but the pope could convince the Venetians. To send a messenger to Constantine. -Right. Needs to know about our efforts. Sultan mine, to 11 months will build a fort. -You have five months. To prevent aid to Constantinople have to take under control the Bosphorus. If you all will carry stones. Just as expected, Constantine sought help from his brothers. Sad but I see that you want to disconnect my the Black Sea, will prevent our trade! Your destination is more than clear. Think you can skip my walls. As your father and you will be dissatisfied. Something that has nothing to do with us because of a letter written without our knowledge ... you stopped the money you pay for Orhan. To continue the peaceful days between us, we did not opposed to this. But if you do not immediately stop the construction, I will send Orhan in Edirne ... I'll do anything to him the throne! Also, if you think that the pope and the Latins will tolerate this, you're wrong. Meet the largest army of crusaders in history! He would raise Orhan. To stop the intrigues that spanned centuries. My people and the army are with me, he knows it. The pope was to gather an army to collect to see. We beat them in Varna and Kosovo I will beat them. I, I do not look like Sultans before me. I am the Sultan Mehmed Khan. This is my land and this will make a fort! Everything is my land, is under my power! Mora / i I will not stop building? -Collected a large army. I will burn him and his army. The pope promised military aid. But they want the union of our church. Why not send Orhan in Edirne? To provoke the anger of people against Mehmed. This is impossible, all with Mehmed Then why keep Orhan here? -Mehmet will not break our walls. The last day will f And then we'll need Orhan. Cannons prepare you? Renewal-end, Emperor. Welcome! -Thank you. Dad and salt to take. Well-daughter. Urban Master! Grand Duke Notarez you cried. Dad? You go home, my daughter, do not worry. Welcome to Urban Master!

Destroyed all Muslim villages on their way. One of them was our village. Killed my whole family. I woke up in the slave market in Constantinople. If Urban was not bought me ... -It is not your father right? As my father is, Since that day, he is the father. Come start leem cannon. I'm good as my father. Girl in the arms factory? -Do not worry, nobody will ever know. Let's go, come on Dad. We did not stay another choice.

Did you forget our past!? Will also damaging to the faith us and our city. Mehmed, in the near future we will attack no time to lose! I beg your Great Emperor! This decision will give our church the Pope! This would be the end of our religion! I prefer the Turks than Latin. We do not want to see false Catholics The Hagia Sophia! I will not betray their religion in the hands of the Pope! I will not pray with them! -Do not want to "St. Sofia"! They want to take our faith! Time to say stop the Catholics, that feed on our blood! Master Urban, I am glad to see you wizard and you to me. Bladodarya you. I want to pouring huge cannon which will in history, vouchsafed to break the walls of Constantinople!

Close your mouth! Not only do I look like a boy! Beautiful as it was in its market I think. Boazkesen, September 1452g. / I The Turks have created a miracle. Look, this is a sign to stop! That they want does not mean that we stop! Dive! County Genoa / i How will my ship sink? -Prepare to besiege Constantinople. It interferes with our trade, also fought with us!

But now ... Well that convinced me daughter. -I know you do it for me daddy. I looked again to the drawings. Well, Dad. I am grateful to His Excellency. Your presence has helped morale of the people and strength of my army. The truth is that you need more help Emperor. If you want help from Catholics for the godless Turks know what to do. For a long time by repeating insistently The Pope is to join the Orthodox to the Vatican. To silence Genadeus would not be problem for the powerful emperor as yours. We will do whatever it takes. My people! Emperor who sold his soul The Pope, how will keep our faith? He fell on his knees before the Pope and sell our religion! Not our tradition, and Catholic action to pray. They want to rule the Orthodox! They will let you do that? -No ... Think again about this decision, my Sultan. We know that the Pope has sent a detachment of archers. Armies will come from Venice and Genoa. German, English and French soldiers will come with security. Englishmen and Frenchmen almost destroyed his army. A German king, dealing with internal problems. Should not you know it better than us Lala? They listened to enough. Reshenieto my final. It is time to consider their own interests to conquest of Constantinople. Or ... Zanos, our spies contact Genadeus. As the time comes, will be able to pray no Catholic natisk.Obeshtavam. Also, tell Urban ready with cannon. Within two months go on the march. After much dust and smoke, this is wonderful. Thank you Hassan. -I do not think you ate a delicious fish before. Very tasty smells. There, ginger and bay leaf.

It is delicious! But I learned the secret of your fish. -You will teach me how to pour cannon. It does not learn as easily as it is arts. This is the fourth attempt, iron is not pure enough. Why stubborn dad? You can put tin. -Know that will solidify before it gets into the matrix. If efforts fire will have no such problem. Fire is sufficient daughter. -Let's try, the pots will last! No, too risky! However, you say no! Dear Giovanni Justinian. -Emperor! You come to support us against the faithless. You and your army is very valuable to us. We are grateful to be here, but ... But let's not forget the past when they Our armies looted the city. Do you think that you are unfair to army that came to save your city? Our people will evaluate everything they do Notarez.
