I take you back to the restaurant. But that is all. Have you felt that? Fucking music! Come on, give me a choice. On the way to the biggest festival and listen to old songs is not for you? Music is a part of life ... There is a perfect song for each event and it is not. - What for a graduation? - "The Greatest Day of Your Live" That was easy ... What to uitzeiken a jade? "Survivor, Eye of the Tiger" And what for "left in the desert, dying of thirst " Chaupens "Funurel March" - It is a clich. - Oh, and not die? O My God! What? Looks like an accident. Call 112.

Whether you have a better idea? A whole box? You never know. What are you complacent. Probably if I knew what it meant. Look what you? Have you stolen from Trip? It is not a steal if you can not give. Yes, it will do. - Does it? - Yes, I'm okay. There is something in the air. Made. I am sorry that I am suspicious. But I prefer to take no risk 's. Hi, I'm Trip. Your opposite. - What is the verdict? - We need petrol. - The petrol station is closed. - Then what we borrow. Where is Jack? Please do not tell me that we that blind guy lost his. I hear nothing. Is he still deaf? Are we in the same restaurant? Hello? Is someone here? Where is everybody gone? Oh, you can even specify that meatloaf? We can use their phone. He must not use. There is no dial tone. What is on here? Everyone here has a dish. the American dream, right? And we have nothing? Is anyone there? We need help with our car. Still nothing! - Did you hear that? - Opus? Wait, go back! Trip, do not move! What? There is some disaster in progress. They have the roads closed! - I heard Bayo! - From Cantrex? That explains the busy tone. I hope no one is injured. Okay, let's not respond. We certainly do not know what they said. So we are here for tonight? We have no other choice. We must be the phones monitor. Well, I take the first watch. - The water does not work. - The bed does. Where else have you get some entertainment for a penny? You are funny for a blind guy. Thank you. What? Coffee machine, duster and slippers? Oh, no ... I am not the biggest party miss the west coast ... I have the whole school to watch.

Where do you doing to in order to stalk people. In a flower shop know you do not really when people besluipt. Nelsen ... love the girls in the holes. I'm going to save us. Do you think this means anything? Yes ... that was crazy here too much time to kill. Who wrote this is a fool. This is just not really a 5 star hotel ... So I stay in my tent tonight. I walk a little road and look around. I do not think that way should go. Thank you, Madam jitterbug, but it's not "we" but I do. If you're lucky to get to petrol back if not then ... look forward to the light arrow! - There was rotting meat, or not? - Yes. Good nose. We have hit someone collection of animals found.
