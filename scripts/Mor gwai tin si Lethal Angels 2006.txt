I heard you need a few handsome guys by chance. I'm not that handsome, but I'm here. You heard it in such a noisy place? Sharp ears. Hello. My name's Big-Guts! Obviously! My name's Dora. Dora. Emma. Hi, Emma. YoYo. YoYo. Mom's right. I'm said to have bad luck this year. Red clothes give me good luck, therefore... What a coincidence! Did your mom tell you that red It may be dangerous! You're out once I'm not inside. Excuse me... Later, later...see you later. talk to you later. Apparently I'm wooing gals... but actually I wanna distract Charlie. Let him think I'm a normal guy. Understand? Hey! Miss... Watch Charlie. I'm gonna write down everything you do tonight. No man does neither drink nor woo here. Too easy to be suspected! How long have you been a cop? Why don't you work better? I don't work better? All of my cells always want to have my first shot! But...no chance! Big Eyes has come! Good place, isn't it? You're so bad. One thing has been troubling me. Why are the gals so pretty every time when G56we are in actions? And while we're off... only ugly ones around us! Your nose's bleeding! Seems I never saw you. Actually I had a dream 2 days ago. What dream? Someone told me in the dream... ...that I must meet the boss here. If he likes me then that'd be great! I also made a dream. It said I'd meet a girl who's called. Dora! Sure. Dora! It said the gal would make me feel happy. Are you sad now? What should I do to make you happier? Let's get in and play. What're you doing? They've gone. I know it with just a glance. I wonder how many girls had died here. Nobody's fear of death. They're feared of dying sadly. Really? Get out. Yes, Winnie. What is this steel pipe used for? You don't wanna play something exciting? Who sends you here? A little girl. You'd have forgot who she is. But she does want you to know. Her dad owes you a bit and you forced her to die. You raped her and forced her to be a hooker. And 2 of your guys raped her again. Wait. Good Morning, Sir! Eat the dinner? Work! Dies with eyes wide open. This is why he's called Big Eyes. After initial analysis of the deponents, these 3 women are suspected as pro killers. Today's professional killers are so pretty. What a pity... There're 20 CCTVs here. Their activities from the entrance to inside... should have been recorded by But not even a single shot could see their face. I don't think it's all by chance. It's reasonable that they're familiar with everything here. They were well prepared to deal with Big Eyes. Did you see anything problematic yesterday? His fault. When the 3 lured the guys I wanna introduce him. He suddenly took me away. Otherwise we'd have succeeded, sir! That means you did met them, did you? As an excellent detective, I am superiorly sensitive. I was watching Charlie while looking at the gals' actions. Anything else found? I found that they speak local Cantonese. And they perfume themselves with Chanel, Armani, Dior. One more important point. They have excellent figures. One has S shape, one wasp waist... Another. Another. This one. Another. This looks more alike. Please turn back to the last page. Alright! Wash your face if you're tired. Apart from the face, would their figures be... Several days a month for a woman. Men... Excuse me, help me up. Sorry. Did I hurt you? Sorry. Are you OK? I'm fine. Let's go. Great. Look at him. What a diligent guy. Keep staying in the library... Studying "a kid" Who are you? You're the one that I respect so much. Can you be my boy? "In the Mortal World". A song for you. Hope you like it. Girl, how should we start? "My University". You should date me and bring me to the ice-cream...movie. Which do you like to watch? The tickets...I've prepared it. You buy me ice-cream. You really know her. No wonder you don't make an Identikit! She's called Mango. We studied in the same school. She didn't appear on the day we first dated 5 years ago. Then I realized the next day... her family were all killed. Her body wasn't found and I never had her news since then. That means she's been lost during I've been thinking if that girl only looks similar... but is not actually her. But did the police school teach you... that you gotta look at the suspects' eyes, lips and... OK. If it's really her, I'm gonna find her ASAP. Anyway, I don't want her do anything wrong again! What's wrong with you? Nothing. Winnie isn't back? Nearly back. Hey, I have something to tell you! I know Big Eyes is hard to deal with. I gotta thank you. Come on, we're sisters. That's no big deal. Sure. You did revenge us. Those count! It just what I wanna say! I'll feel better then! Honestly, the most we should thank is Winnie. Without her instruction and care, we would've been nothing. I heard someone said she gotta thank me. Winnie. You even finished Big Eyes. Well done. Thank you. We've seen all. So we said we should thank Winnie. He's called Bowen. Boss of Hung Hing Gang. The guy beside him is his sworn bro, Bowell. The one practicing yoga...is his wife? Sure. She's called May. The little girl beside her is her daughter? She's Sandy. 6 years old. Has congenital asthma. Bowen's one and only weakness... is that girl. What should we do next? There're 3 steps to complete the mission. First, sneak into their home. Second, find out their safe box. Steal his evidence of all offences. He has a wife. How could we get in? A nurse is always taking care of the girl. Then we're gonna make the nurse... never be able to look after the girl. Yoyo, you learned first aid before. Let you be the nurse. Professional documents are all inside here. OK? You said there are 3 steps. So the third is... After you take the stuff, kill them all. Elimination. Why? I only consider whether the mission is completed or not. I never ask why. But what about the girl? She only 6... She may have nothing to do with the case. Are you not clear about my words? I said elimination! Why did you say that? Do you know Bowen used to be Winnie's guy? Just when Winnie knew she had Bowen's baby... Bowen urged Winnie to leave just for another woman. He made Winnie disfigured, and even lost her baby. Sure. Winnie had a face redo. But she could never forget... what the bastard had done to her. She swore that he must let his family die. Nothing left! But she doesn't need to kill the kid. We're Winnie's followers. We won't let Bowen's kid go. The cake is beautiful. Let me taste it. Hey...what're you doing? Big sis, young sis ate the cake again. You're elder bro. Why don't you take care of her? The cake should've been shared... It's all a mess! Sis, you're going shopping again? Sure. I'm going to the movie with my pal then. Can I go with you? I won't tell. Sis, you have a boyfriend? No kidding! Needless to say. Yes for sure! What're you doing? Get away! Don't block my way! Be the hero yourself! Who do you think you are? You're only a taxi driver. You dare infuriate the triads? Dare go to give a deposition. I saw him killing others. How can I pretend to have seen nothing? Don't worry. They're all caught and sentenced. Come on. Dad, Mom, let's slice the cake. Mom...Let's go! Mom...I think dad's doing what a citizen should do. If everyone's scared to be the witness, the bandits would be more fierce than ever. Of course I know it. I'm worried if the bandits would hurt you. OK... But I think... I feel proud if dad if he dares to do it. Come on, darling. Blow out the candles. You informer! No! Get away! Get away! Come out! Come out! Run! Sis, run! Help! Don't run Help... You have no way out. I got you! Let me go... Gorgeous. Don't touch me... Boss No...Let me go... Shut up! What're you waiting for? Yes, boss. You go and look at it. Yes, boss. Nobody here? Emma, now's the time to test your accuracy. Not bad. Well done. Hey, are you feeling better? Thank you for saving me. You're welcome. I can't save you. In the last resort... only you can save yourself. Please help me. How to help? Please revenge me. Are you prepared? What? Are you ready? Are you ready? You say you're ready? Based on what? Does it hurt? This is reality! Nobody cares if you're hurt. They only know you're easily dealt with. Are you really prepared? Are you ready? Are you ready? You gotta be ready. Are you ready? Are you ready? I'm ready. I'm ready... I'm ready! Welcome! Guns are a kind of good lethal weapon. You gotta master it. Give me all As! Guns are a kind of good weapon, but it's not the best tool for a killer. The brain is the most vulnerable part. If the blood can't reach it, the guy'll be in trouble. Therefore, once the throat, head... and other main arteries in the body... are damaged to some extent, one would die easily. Most men are nasty. They only care women's appearance. When they see women with the figure of they'll only think how to have sex with you. Then that's when they're least alert. As long as you're able to arouse their sexual desire, it's absolutely easy to kill them. In other words, your bodies... are the real lethal weapons. Understand? It's one thing to shoot a playing card. But to end one's life in reality... that's another thing. You've done very well. I've prepared a gift for you. This is a bottle of stimulant. He'd be 10 times stronger. You gotta face him, just like facing a beast. Yoyo, you gotta do your utmost. If you wanna be a real killer, You have to kill him. Master, you're back? Where's Sandy? She's upstairs. She has good appetite today. Where's the new nurse? She's come. The tea is hot. You're back? This is miss Kong. Just arrives here today. Mr. Bao. Nice to meet you. Take good care of Sandy from now on. This is my duty. Sandy is a good girl. Not naughty at all. If you have any problems... go ahead tell us. Thank you, Mr. Bao. Everything's fine. No problem so far. Alright. Sandy! Dad! I've finished my work. I'm so tired. Go get some rest then. But gotta be serious about your homework. You said you'd bring me to the park. When? Tomorrow...tomorrow. It's a holiday tomorrow. Let's go tomorrow. Great! Where's mom? Get up. Mr. Bowen. Madam. Sandy! Again... A newbie? Don't make fun of me. Gotta talk with uncle Bowell. Honey, if nothing else to do, we'll go back to the room. Time to have medicine, Sandy. Good girl, Sandy. Thanks. No thanks. This gal's figure's better than the last one. She's here to look after Sandy. Don't ever have any evil ideas. I'm just kidding. Don't be serious. What's the deal with Charlie? He wanna invade our places in Western District. Don't worry. I won't let him do too much. Better not argue with Charlie. If he didn't help me, we wouldn't have been here today. Bro, you shouldn't think this way. We've been supporting him for many years. And he gets back everything. Underground stuff makes me tired. I've now decided to quit. Bowell, think it over. Now is different. If we keep doing such things... we can't lead a good life. Bro, everyone has their own ambition. What's up now? I've searched the study room but can't find anything. Bowen is a smart guy. Must have put the safe box into the most secret place. Keep on searching. Yes. Keep your voice down. What do you fear? Keep your voice down. Damn. What if Bowen hears it? Louder music can cover your voice. Your Bowen is worried about his daughter's cough. He can't sleep well. If he find it when he wakes up... then it's over. So...we gotta be quick. And you must cooperate. You...you bad guy! I'm bad. But that old butt's even worse. He want me to quit. Bowell... I ask you... When're you gonna leave with me? Bowell... Bowell. Do you want me to bring you away? Seen when I'll hold the old butt's hand... and open the safe box with his fingerprints, and take away everything inside. Maybe I'll think about it. Dad, hold it tight. Be careful. Are you OK, Winnie? It's heavy. Take care. Hurry up... Don't be frightened, Mr. Bowen. You gotta let Sandy play more right here. Much better than staying at home. I had too little time to stay with her. Sandy's sophisticated. She'll understand. That's her? Good shape. Mr. Bowen, can I talk with you? Miss Kong, go watch Sandy. OK. You seem to be happy with your life now. Good enough. Which means your decision of quitting... is correct. Let's be straightforward. If I were you... I would treasure everything I had at present. Does Sergeant Wai come here today... not just for talking about your view of life? We have credible information. Someone says your life's too good... and wanna give you troubles. What do you mean? Someone doesn't want you to live, and wanna kill you. I've been with the gangs for years. And I've offended numberless people. It's not a surprise that they want me dead. Who would they be? Too many. You're not scared of death? Thank you for your concern. Your daughter's still a kid... she needs you so much. Have you ever thought that if you die... how would she live? I know how to deal with it. Sure. Your society has its own rules. So does the police. But I don't wanna see you killing each other. You know how to find me if you need to. I won't need it. I'm leaving. Give me, give me... Sir. Excuse me. You still remember... ...I wanted to watch this in our first date. Everything that happened on that day... I'll never forget. Why didn't you find me after that? It happened, and... I don't want others to be victims. You're not able to control it. If I were you... I'd rather pretend to know nothing. I thought you meet me here... just to have a date with me once again. I don't wanna see you hurt. You should know who Bowen is. Why are you working here? What does Big Eyes have to do with you? What do you want to hear? Keep working and you'll be in big trouble. Listen to me...Stop it. You guys are wanted. Do you know? You never know who you're facing. I only know you're one of them. I'll say it again... Don't get involved in this case. Stop the investigation. Why? Why? I can tell you no more. I won't let you go. Please cooperate with us. This is your only way out. I'm here today just to remind you. I don't want you to be in danger. I'll never say a word... even if you catch me now. At least you'll be safe. I know you care for me. Trust me. Just a few days later... everything will be done. I hope you really know what you're doing. Get in the car! You disappoint me. Winnie, I... Don't tell me you don't know he's a cop. I know. And you're getting along with him? I knew him years ago. He was not a cop. I just had a chat with him. Do you still remember... what I talked with you... when I first trained you? Sure I do. Tell me. You said a professional killer... must be cold-blooded. In any conditions, you gotta be emotionless. Especially for men. Why? You can have emotions while killing. No emotions means no mistakes. Great! You understand it. I don't need to teach you. Winnie, I won't see him, I promise. Such kind of things won't happen twice. I'm all for your sake. Men always want to hurt us. Are you gonna blame me? Of course not. Thank you, Winnie. Actually, do you need to tell me something? What's happening now? It's the business between me and her. If you don't tell me about that... It'd be dangerous if others know it. As excellent detectives... you know where she is but you don't report it. And you had a date with her... without letting me know. That's fine. What if I lost my job? You pay for me? Don't kid me! I didn't! Calm down, man. Honestly, many years have passed. I don't believe she'd kill. Do you know what I wanted to be in my childhood? A cop. A pimp. I never thought I'd become a cop. People always change their thoughts. She wants me to give her a bit more time. Are you OK? It's not easy to give "time". Help me if you think you're my buddy. Sure. I must help you. But have you ever thought that... she may...she may be under control... and she controls you and me? Or... But now I can. I must do what I promised her. I must help you and support you. You think I really fear of losing the job? I've been a cop for 8 years. Just wanna be safe. You know it. I'm worried about you. You have bright future and opportunities. Gotta think about it. Think about it. I know you care about me. You really do? Stay up so late? Sure. I know you're waiting for me. Are you? Anything happened? Nothing. You smell good. You stink. You reek of wine. Please be respectful! You're here just for gain more. I'll give you money. Stop! Let me go! Sure, no problem. No pretending. Just once. Let me go... Bowell. See what you look like! What're you pretending? You like her? You do first! Are you all right? Do you feel better now? You're drunk and gotta rest more. Don't mess up here and wake Sandy. Piss off! Alright. Are you OK? Thank you, Mr. Bowen. You're out now? I intended to go get some night snacks... But I'm not going now. Have more rest. Watch it together. It's brand new. It talks about 2 new roomers claiming that... they're fixing pipes... and finally something great happens. Nonsense. Nonsense? You must have watched it. I'm gonna sleep. Gotta get up early. You'll waste it if don't watch it. Could it be? I have illusions if I watch more? Hello! Hello! Girls... What can I do for you? You look familiar. Sorry... Not enough? One more punch? Where's he? What he? Run! Get in the car! Let's hide. Where is this place? Empty room. Nobody lives here. You can rest here without worrying. Are you all right? What do you think? It surely hurts. Why yell? I didn't touch you. I didn't say you touched me. It's so roomy. And a bed right there. Why don't you move there... Let's go. Hey? Are you dying? Dying? It's nothing. There's something more. Wanna see? The scars. You'll know it's not easy to be a cop. Thigh first. Look, what a long scar. Not that great. There's the bigger one. Never tell others. This one is more powerful. See! I've watched that movie. The main actor's called... What Gib? Mel Gibson. Yes, Mel Gibson. Lethal Weapon You really like to watch movies. Hand. Thank you. It's minor matter. Sure, minor matter... What would happen? They can never think of this place. Listen to me. Surrender. Too many things had happened. Surrender doesn't mean everything's done. Do you have alternatives? Please trust be. Why don't you understand... that there's no turning back? What do you want? Don't think too much. Have some rest. Don't think too much about what to do next. Don't leave me alone. Where're they? You're awake? They...do you see them? They left. Where to? How do I know? When I was half asleep... they were likely to say they gotta do... something we can't help. Why didn't you stop her? Sir, I only got up 10 minutes earlier than you. And you ask me a lot? You held her and kissed her last night... you must have her cell number. Go ask her. She left this. Don't think too much. You've thought what I've thought. We can't even beat 2 of them. What can we do? By the way... why would I haven't known Emma earlier? Then she wouldn't have done all these things. No. After she's done and back... I must... be responsible. A man's duty... You too. Kissing? Feeling good? Swim in the morning. Looking for me? Winnie. I haven't thought you dare to come back. Sorry. Please forgive me. You betray me just because of a man? No. It's not what you think. And you! Winnie, it's all my fault. Emma only helped me. Don't blame her. I'll deal with her later. I have a task for you. Dora's gonna tell you. You go out now. You never betrayed me. This is the first time. Which means there'll be the second. No, I won't. I'm always loyal to you. I only want you to let him go. What if I say no? Winine, he's a cop, actually. But I'm sure... he'd never affect any of your plan. You'd better let go of him. Is he so important to you? You're willing to sacrifice for him? Are you sure it's worth doing it? Yes. Fine! Let's not talk about it for now. Bowen is going to announce that he will quit his underground business tomorrow. The gang will since have no relationship with him. Winnie, do you want me to do something? Bowen'll invite his buddies at home. I gotta act at that moment? Yes. Tomorrow is the best chance. I think I know what to do. Macy, Dora and I will sneak into the place. We'll cooperate when necessary. I got it. How about Emma? Another task for her. This time...I don't wanna see any troubles. You won't. You should know how important the mission is. Once you complete it, I'll accept your request. Really, Winnie? Thank you. Nothing else. You go back to Bowen's home. OK. I'm going. Winnie. Winnie. You're still alive? Do you know what mistake you've made? You successfully left... why come back? Get her. I've never seen such big breasts. Not only touching. We can do everything we like. She's still alive. Don't waste our time. Me first! What? You first again? What? Me first! Me first! Alright! Let's go. Let's go. Get away! Far away! Don't trouble me! You'll see! It's worth paying for. Way too exaggerated! Buddies... Bowen has something to say. Bowen! Everybody. Hold on. I have some words to say. We've been working together for all these years. And we finally have our society. Now's time to give the young guys a chance. I really have to quit. Hope you'll teach Bowell. I'm in poor health. The doctor doesn't allow me to drink. I'm drinking tea to thank you all! Great! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Today we're...in a good mood! Great! Cheers... You get in first. Bowell Where did you find this gal? Don't worry. All introduced by familiar guys. No problem. Look. Buddies're enjoying themselves. What's your name? My name's Dora. Dora. Let's get in and play. Why don't you go into the room? You really want to know? Coz you think it's more exciting here. Honestly, it's because... I've tried so many ways of killing. But I've never tried... to kill others in the toilet. So...I want to have a try. Really? Sure. What the hell're you doing? This is much more fun. I'll get killed. You men are all the same kind. Yoyo, I'm looking for dad. Sandy, good girl. Let's play a game now. You'll see dad if you win. Sure! What game? Hide...and seek. You hide somewhere and I'm gonna catch you. Sure. I played it in school. I'm great. Every time I hide... nobody can find me out. Run. Hide. Be quick. What's wrong with you, May? What do you want? Bowen! You must have never known... who I am. Who are you? I'm the woman...you wanted to kill How could you be her? I'm pretty and so you can't recognize me. Honestly, I must thank you. If you were not that cruel... and made me disfigure... I wouldn't have had a face done. and wouldn't have become what I am! It doesn't matter that you have other women. But you killed your own baby. You deserve to die 10,000 times! Unforgivable! Don't beat me... I beg you. If you're gonna kill me... please let go of your own kid... Is that really you? I don't wanna talk other things with you. If you don't wanna see your wife get killed... then open the safe box! Honey! Don't listen to her! The safe box uses time lock. Can't open it if time doesn't suit! Honey... This is a fingerprint lock. Not a time lock at all. Fine. Don't hurt her. It's surprising that... your wealth is more than I expected. Now you got money and remedy. Don't hurt my family, please. The only way to remedy, is to eliminate your family! Winnie...Not your business! Honey... You're too naive! You... You think I really loved you? Let me tell you. I am...one of them. May! You're also native. Kill everyone Act now. Miss Kong, please be kind. Save Sandy... So you've hidden in the wardrobe. I've found you. Shut up. Shut your mouth! Dad, mom...Shut up! Shut your mouth! Got it? Shut up! Let her go. No. Finish her. Wanna betray me again? Don't kill her! Sandy, run. Yoyo, you totally disappoint me. I go catch the girl. You deal with her. No... Help! Help... Help... Police! Freeze! Shot that quick. Are you OK? Freeze! Freeze... Yoyo...Are you all right? You've come. You look well. Where's Sandy? We sent her to the orphanage. And... She hope you'll be fine soon. Bowen knows that... he had done countless guilty things... and will come to a bad end. Have you found Winnie? Don't worry. I won't let her hurt you. Take care of yourself... once you haven't caught her. I'll never let her hurt me. If I'm in trouble, who comes to protect you? Alright... How long is Emma sentenced? I'll be more or less the same, right? I'll wait for you. Excuse me. Time for checking. Thanks. No thanks. Wanna go? You'll get buried with them. Winnie... Stop. It's OK... You did something right before dead. I've waited for 8 years for this shot. It's OK... Stop! Why escape from me? still pretty. Watery eyes... Do you know I've been searching for you all these years? I wanted to see you but I couldn't come. My performance in police force is too good. They didn't let you come, and... I was sent to UK as a spy. I can see you now... I haven't thought I could see you here. I'm so... No! Too excited. No...yell after we go home. Don't you remember? I said I'd be responsible. Why don't you go to die! I said you've recognized the wrong person! Shit! A woman who looks really the same. How dare you! I know. I know I'm bold. Sorry. What do you want? Long time no see. You keeps your figure. Do you have a boyfriend now? This movie...how many times have you watched it? Forgot. Still watching? Let's go. Now you're here. Let's finish it. I've been looking for the chance to watch it. And I've never thought I gotta take years to do so.
