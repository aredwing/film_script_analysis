The exorcisms took place in a house in a suburban neighborhood of St. Louis, Missouri. The case inspired a bestselling book and a blockbuster film. But what happened inside that house, and what happened after has never been told. Until now. - Almighty everlasting god, giver of all good things and bountiful bestower of all graces, we humbly beg you to endow us with the power of your blessing. May it also please you to bless, by the work of the holy spirit, this stole made ready for your work. Kindly let the grace of your holy mysteries descend on your servants, that they may appear holy, pure, and blameless in your presence, and may be aided by your mercy, through Christ our lord. - Amen. - Our help is in the name of the lord. - Who made heaven and earth. - The lord be with you. - May he also be with you. Do you hear that? - Don't listen. - Remember me, halloran? - Remember me. - Halloran. Halloran! K driving in your fast car, looking like a big shot k boy you gave 'em hell tonight k but all your trophies still can't make you smile k living the express Lane, sipping on the mundane k boy you make it look like fun k but when the music stops will where you run k but you're on your way k you wanted this, you saved, you're on your way k I wish you could have stayed but there was nothing left k to give or take k you're in the fast Lane now and you gave k hey k hey k hey k hey k hey k hey k - what are you doing here, Gordon? - Luke told me you were coming to get the keys. - Where's Luke? - Inside. I told him I wanted to talk to you first. - My mind's made up. I want the house. - Well, that's not your decision to make. The house belongs to the family and I've been entrusted to finally get rid of it. - The sign says for sale. I already told you I can get the loan. - Money's not the point. Our family doesn't live here for a reason. - Just because it's not good enough for your family... - I wouldn't let my family live in a house that's... - That's what? Say it! Haunted? - Will you shut up? Now listen to me. You just get this crazy idea about living inside this house out of your head and let it go. Where you going? - Inside my damn house. - So, obviously i haven't touched anything. I got the water turned on in case you need to use the bathroom. - I'm fine. And I'm not six anymore. - Ah, these god damn kids. - That's what happens when nobody lives in a house for 50 years. - So, I talked to aunt Margaret. She didn't say anything. I don't think she knew who i was. - She's got Alzheimer's. What do you expect? - Yeah. - What do you wanna do with it? - What? All this? This all goes with the house, as far as I'm concerned. - Done. - No. No. You don't know when to give this up, do you? - Do you have any other offers? - No, I don't. - Come on, please. I want this for my family. - Come on. Don't do this. - Don't do what? - Gordon doesn't think that we can swing the loan by ourselves. - All I'm saying is it's a big risk. You never know what you're gonna get with a house that's old like this. - Well, I was looking in the basement. It's got good bones. Lights work. Hey, baby. How's my sweet potato pie? - So you like it? - I love it. - So do I. - I guess it's settled. - I guess so. So listen, when I was putting the house on the market, I asked around about getting it blessed. Just in case. Now lutherans don't do that kind of thing, but, I found somebody who does. - A catholic priest? Now you're the one that doesn't know when to let go. This is my life. And Luke's. - I've always looked out for you, and I'm not gonna stop now. I mean, I introduced you to Luke. - And not a day goes by that I don't thank you in my heart. But, you have got to stop acting like my big cousin. - Okay. - Luke and I have been under stress lately, but I can take care of myself. - Alright. - Got it. There must be a key on here for every day of the month. - I'll take those. And you boys go bust some law breakers. - Yes, ma'am. - Oh, Gordon. I'm gonna stop by the hospital. See aunt Margaret. - Let me know if she remembers you. And hey... About that thing we talked about. - Amy? Margaret wasn't expecting visitors. Would you like to go in? It's okay. You won't wake her. She's been sedated. She had an episode this morning. - What happened? - She lacerated her arm. It happens sometimes with patients in her condition. They become agitated and hurt themselves, and don't even realize that they've done it. It looked like she was trying to write words. - What words? - Oh, nothing to be concerned about. She's fine now. I'll leave you two. - Aunt Margaret? Do you know who I am? Margaret? - I have no name. - She didn't even recognize me. She just flipped out and shoved some kind of wooden heart in my hand. It has blood on it. - Hey, are you okay? - Yeah. I just hate seeing her like that. - I don't know why you went over there anyway. - I thought maybe I could get her blessing on the house. I thought it might make her happy to know someone was living in it again. But she... Wasn't herself. I don't wanna talk about it anymore. - What was that other thing that you and Gordon were talking about? - Nothing. I'm gonna go get some boxes, and start to pack. - Look, Amy. If you're upset, maybe now is not the best time to be making big changes. - Hey, will you stop acting like Gordon? I'm okay. - Okay. I'll be working late tonight. Natural bridge road. I probably will not be able to answer my phone. So... - I said I'm okay. I'll see you when you get off your shift. I love you. - Love you too. - First up in this afternoon's broadcast, granite city police are searching for a driver in a fatal hit and run accident that occurred near terminal Avenue. Police say the incident took place around 3:30 this afternoon, leaving a female pedestrian dead. Witnesses say a white minivan was travelling at excessive speed when it veered onto the meridian, striking the woman before speeding off. Right now, police are... Metro St. Louis can expect showers in the late afternoon and early evening, with increased activity overnight and into the early morning hours. Make sure you take an umbrella with you when you go... - Pet clinics throughout the area are offering fifty percent off the service to owners who bring their cats or dogs in this weekend. No word on how the pets feel about the offer. The St. Louis county's clerk's office is continuing to investigate corruption charges at the local firm responsible for providing waste service pickup in unincorporated areas outside the metropolitan district. A spokesman for a.M.I industries, which is responsible for residential trash pickup in the area, says that the company is cooperating fully with the county. The clerk's office had no comment, citing an ongoing investigation. Ladies and gentlemen, we're just receiving reports of an officer involved shooting which has closed parts of natural bridge road. Witnesses are telling our reporters at least one St. Louis county officer was shot while another was fatally injured when the driver of a stolen SUV exited his vehicle and began firing on the busy street. We'll keep you updated on the condition of the injured officer... - Luke, when you get this call me. I love you. - At this hour, natural bridge road remains closed, and authorities are suggesting... - Luke, I'm serious, damnit! Call home now! Faye? Faye, it's Amy. Is your dad home? Can I talk to him? Gordon? Is Luke with you? He was okay after his shift, right? Well, I tried his phone, and I'm watching the news, and I just say that... - What's wrong? - Nothing. Nothing's wrong. Everything's okay. - Ladies and gentlemen, we're just receiving reports, of an officer involved shooting, which has closed parts of natural bridge road. Witnesses are telling our reporters at least one St. Louis county officer was shot. - We've been though this. You can't call me every time you get a feeling. - I just need to know that you're okay. - Sweet potato, I'm always okay. But I can't always take calls in the field. Sometimes I don't even have my phone on me. You know that. - It was after your shift. You should have picked up. - You're right. You are right. I should have. But you also know that if something did happen, I would call. Or someone would. Right? - Seriously? Stupid storm. Hello? Oh my god. Damn it. Luke? I know I'm not supposed to call you at work, but I think somebody's in the house. - Must be at the pole. Damn it. We're gonna have to get that fixed. - Look at this. - Damn kids tagged down here too. Lucky they didn't burn the whole place down. - No Luke. Look at it. This is not new. Look at that car. It's old. - We'll get it painted over. - This. This is new. - Okay. I'll... Get the locks changed tomorrow. See about an alarm. Okay? Why did you come over here by yourself? - I just wanted to drop off some stuff. - You wanted to stake a claim so Gordon couldn't say no. You should have asked me. - You would have said no. - Maybe I would have helped. I don't know why you always try to make everything such a secret. - Did Gordon say something? - He didn't have to. I know you don't sleep. I know you have nightmares. - That has absolutely nothing to do with... With our house. - Your parents? - No. - That why Gordon's so protective of you? He hasn't said anything. I can just tell. He's looking out for you. - When I was a kid, I used to hear voices. Telling me to come here. To the house. - What kind of voices? - It was just stupid kid stuff. - This one? Clear. You never told me... These voices. - I didn't want you thinking i was crazy. Or Gordon. - Why would I think Gordon's crazy? - He used to hear them too. - No signs of forced entry. Anybody else in your family hear these voices? - Aunt Margaret. But I don't think that's why she closed the house. I think she was hiding something. - What? - I don't know. But I'm not going to let it chase me out of our house. - It's not our house yet. You lost them under here? - Yeah. - Bad day to lock your keys in the car. - Can you just open it, Gordon? - Let me get my slimjim. - Hey. It happens all the time. They're probably just locked inside the car. - I told you I locked the keys in the house. - Okay. - I can get you in, but you're still gonna need your key to start it. - Just do it. - Hey, I can drop you at the apartment. - No, you need to get back to work. - I can be late. - Luke, I'm fine. I told you I lost the keys inside. I was just afraid that somebody was in the house. I checked and their isn't, so I'll go inside, find the keys, and drive myself home. - Amy? - I lost those inside the house. - You're welcome. - I'm not crazy. Sweet potato, I know. It happens to everyone. See you tonight. - Amy? Hi, I'm father halloran. I'm told you wanted to see me. - Is there some place we could talk, father? - Of course. Sister Mary Katherine likes to keep it dark in here. I think it reminds her of a confessional. Please. Have a seat. - Do you have any experiences with ghosts? - Ghosts? No. Technically, the church has no official position on ghosts. - But what about something that might haunt a house? Evil spirits? - Well, the Bible does have something to say on that subject. But evil spirits are very rare. I'd rule out noisy plumbing or rats in the walls first. - I know it sounds stupid. - No. No. Trust me, it's not stupid. The real question though is, why do you believe your house is haunted? - I don't. My cousin does. He thought that maybe a blessing would help. - But you don't. - I don't believe in... This. - Skepticism is the beginning and end of wisdom. In jesuit school they teach us logic and debate. Not to bolster our faith, but to test it. - And you're gonna tell me that all the answers are in there. - No. But I will tell you a wonderful story that was told to me by a good friend, a rabbi. Once, two very learned rabbi's lived in the same town. People came from miles around to hear these rabbis argue. If one rabbi said hot, the other said cold. If one said light, the other said dark. One day a man came to the town. He went to the first rabbi and he asked him this question. Can you teach me the whole of the torah while standing on one foot? Well, the rabbi became very angry with the man. He told him it was a preposterous question, and he threw him out of his house. So the man went to the second rabbi. He asked him the same question. Can you teach me the whole of the torah while standing on one foot. The rabbi immediately stepped on the man's foot and said do unto others as you would have them do unto you. That is the whole of the torah. The rest is commentary. Now go and study. - Meaning. - Meaning answers is simple. Faith takes effort. - How does this fit in? - Where did you get that? - My aunt Margaret. - Margaret starke is your aunt? - How did you know that? - Get that out of here. - Why? - Take that thing and get out. - What did it... - I said take that and get out! - So you're saying you scratched yourself under the bed, and this scratch looks like a t? - Yeah. The same t. There. - That could be a coincidence. - Does that look like a coincidence? - Maybe. Okay, let's say it is a t. Let's say it's the same t. What does tes stand for? - I think they're initials. Whoever owned the spirit talking board. - Spirit talking board? Have you talked to Gordon about this? No. God no. And don't you talk to him about it either. He'd just love this. - Why? I thought you said he used to hear the voices too. Maybe he knows who tes is. - I told you. I didn't hear voices. I imagined I heard voices. Only a crazy person is gonna hear voices and believe it. - And a sane person scratches letters into their skin. - I am not crazy. - Sorry. It's just a ghost scratching letters into your skin because of a spirit talking thing... - It's a spirit talking board. - Whatever. Amy, it sounds crazy. - You think I don't know how it sounds. I think something... Someone is trying to tell me something. - What? - I don't know. But I have to find out. As crazy as that sounds, I need to know what it is. - And what if you don't like what the answer is? - What the hell are you doing here? - I came to see your aunt. - How did you find her? - Well, this is a catholic hospital, and I thought I could help. Both of you. - Get out. - Please. I'm terribly sorry for the way i acted. It's just that you surprised me, and I did... Your arm. Is it bothering you? - It doesn't hurt... Much. - May I? - What? - I think you should see something. - Oh my god. - You've never seen these before? - No. She's always had her arms covered. T-e-s. Aunt Margaret? - Who are you? - I'm Amy. I know you don't remember me, but I need you to remember. How did you get these scratches on your arm? Who did this to you? - I don't know who you are. I remember you. - Calm down! 20 ccs endomorphil. Get her. Hold her down. - I got her. - I got her wrist. - Remember me! - It's in. Wait outside. - How's she doing? - Sedated. Resting. - What's wrong with her? What's wrong with me? - I'm not a psychiatrist. - Does this look like i need a psychiatrist? She said, I remember you. How? - I'm sorry. I have to be going. - You said you would help me. - I was wrong. - Margaret. Elizabeth. Starke. M-e-s. Aunt tillie. T. T-e-s. Tille. Elizabeth. Starke. - Amy? What are you doin'? So, who is this ghost? - Tille Elizabeth starke. Margaret's aunt. My great aunt. I think she's the one that wanted me to find it. I think it's her voice I'm hearing. - Okay, this is getting weird. Do you really think you should do that? - If she's trying to communicate, if I'm gonna stop the nightmares, if we're gonna make this our home, I have to ask her. - Ask her what? - Is anyone here? Is anybody here? - Maybe it's stuck. - Is anybody here? - Did you just feel that? - Is anybody here? Well, I guess that's our answer. Nobody's here. - Did you just do that? - No. - Let's stop. - Who are you? - Amy. Really. Stop. Is that you saying now? - No, I didn't do that. - Then what? It's the ghost saying it doesn't want us to know its name? - Oh my god. - I'm done playing games. Put that stupid thing away. - I swear I'm not doing it. - I'm through. If you wanna move into this house, you'd better stop playing games. Because this is messed up. I'm not sure I want to move here with you. - What's that supposed to mean? You were all, I guess it's all settled, in front of Gordon. - What was I supposed to say? You dragged me over... - I dragged you over here? - Yes. - You couldn't run here fast enough with Gordon. - Gordon is my partner. And he's your cousin. I don't understand... - So that gives him the right to tell me what I can and can't do? We're not doing that. - Then who? Somebody's messing with us. - How did they move the pointer? - Magnets. - There aren't any magnets. - I'm a police officer! I'm coming up! - Luke. Don't. - I'm coming in. - Luke. You hear that, right? - Yeah. - Where's it coming from? - What? - Luke! Luke. Luke, unlock the door, Luke. Luke, what's going on? Unlock the door! - Amy! - Luke, hold on. I have to go get the key. - Amy. - Gordon. - Come here. - Oh Gordon. Oh my god. Gordon. - What the hell are you doing here? I saw your car out front. Where's Luke? - Luke. Luke! Oh god. Luke. Luke! Luke. Luke, baby, look at me. Look at me. Oh my god. The report's gonna say that Luke slipped and hit his head. That is was an accident. Nobody's gonna think that you did it. - I didn't do it. - Amy? He didn't do that to himself. You two are the only ones there. You said it yourself, you two have been under a lot of stress, what with the whole house thing. - It has nothing to do with the house. It has to do with our family. Yours and mine. - I don't know what you're talking about. - You knew about the exorcism in that house. That uncle Robbie when he was a kid, he was possessed. That's why aunt Margaret closed the house for 50 years. That's why you sent me to that priest. You heard those voices when we were kids, same as me. You knew. - Those voices weren't real. Ghosts aren't real. - Is this real enough for you? It's because of our family. - Jesus Christ, Amy. Our family is not crazy! - That's what this is about. You're afraid that it's in us, and that you could pass it down to faye. - Goddamnit, you leave my daughter out of this! This is your fault. I told you to leave that house be. - It's not in the house, Gordon. It's in us! We have to stop this. Margaret gave me the pointer. She knows what's going on. Maybe she was trying to tell us how to get it to go away. Maybe she could help us get rid of it. - Maybe she's as crazy as you are! - I have to talk to her. I have to get her to tell me everything she knows. - Margaret's dead. She died tonight in her sleep. That's what I was coming over to tell you. Where you going? - To the house. - No, no no no no no. You're not going... - I have to use the board. I have to tell whatever is doing this to stop. I have to make it go away. I have to get it to leave Luke alone. Your fianc is lying in that room. I shouldn't have to tell you what to do. - You can't tell me what to do! - You're right. You're right. I can't. - Answers are easy. Faith requires effort. - You knew about the exorcism before I even came to see you, because you were there. - I was a young priest. Just out of the seminary. I actually think father bowdern chose me more for my physical strength than my liturgy. The possessed can pose a risk to others. As well as to themselves. - What happened? - A young boy, your uncle. He was ten years old. He received a gift for Christmas. A spirit board from the maiden aunt. Soon after, he began suffering from a strange affliction. He heard voices, spoke in tongues, claimed he was the devil. His parents took him to doctors. He just got worse. Sores began appearing all over his body. They formed letters. Words. Finally, in desperation, his parents contacted the church. An exorcism was approved. Father bowdern was selected to perform the rites. He chose me to assist. - Remember me. - I remember. - Remember me. That's what Margaret said to you in the hospital. - That's what the boy said to me that night. He knew me. - How? The devil knows all of us. He knows our name. You see, a name is a very powerful thing. It makes a thing real. In the liturgy, in order to an unclean spirit, we first must force it to reveal its name. - What's the devil's name? - To hear it is madness. To speak it is everlasting damnation. That board was used as a means to summon the spirit. But it was called by someone who knew its name. Tillie Elizabeth starke died just after she gave your aunt and her brother that board. The possession began the night she died. - She was trying to communicate with them. What was she trying to say? - It doesn't matter. Do not listen to it. - It's already speaking to me. Help me! - I assisted father bowdern. I'm not an exorcist. - There has to be some way to stop this. - Look, I'm not here to debate you. - When you were in jesuit school, they taught you logic and debate to test your faith. That night the devil tested your faith. And you failed. - I'm sorry. I can't help you. - Then I'll help myself. Luke? Luke. - I'm sorry. - Oh my god. What are you doing here? - I followed you. I may not be an exorcist, but I'm still a priest. - Come with me. Luke's going to the house. - Why? - Because that's where the voices are telling him to go. - How do you know? - I hear them too. Luke? - Remember me. - I'm gonna burn that thing. There are kerosene cans down in the basement. - We will, but burning it won't save Luke. No. No. It knows we're here. It wants us to come up. But if you want to save Luke, we have to go up prepared. Amy. The possessed can be very dangerous. We have to secure him. Do you understand? An exorcism can only be performed under the sanction of the church. I don't have that sanction, but I can perform the sacraments and they can be very powerful. Our help lies in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth. Everlasting, almighty god, giver of all good things and maker of all graces, we humbly beg you to endow us with the power of your blessing. May it please you to bless, through the intercession of the holy spirit, this stole made ready for your divine work. Let the graces of your holy mysteries descend upon us who use it, so that they may be aided by your mercy through Christ our lord. Amen. - Gordon. I know you probably don't wanna talk to me, but I need your help. It's Luke. Look, I don't want to go into this on the phone, but, we're at the house. When you get this please just come, okay? Goodbye. Do you hear that? - Don't listen. - It's worked before. Right? - Don't be afraid. We face the devil everyday. Tonight he faces god. - Remember me, halloran? - Luke? - It's not Luke. But I know you. Halloran. Oh, I know you. Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespassed against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power and the glory. Forever and ever. Amen. I believe in Jesus Christ... He descended into hell. On the third day he rose again. He ascended into heaven. He is seated at the right hand of god the father, almighty. From thence he will come to judge the living and the dead. - Amy? Amy, what's happening? - Luke? Oh my god. Baby. You're gonna lose him. Just like your daddy. Did you moan for him, you slut? Did you like it when you tasted him? - Don't listen to it. - Eat me, halloran! - I command you, unclean spirit, by the holy mysteries of the incarnation, passion, resurrection, and ascension of our lord Jesus Christ, tell me your name. I command you, I who am a minister of god despite my unworthiness, i command you, reveal your name. - I have no name. - I command you in the name of our lord and savior Jesus Christ give me your name that you may be driven out. He commands you, he who flung you headlong from the heights of heaven into the depths of hell. Reveal your name. - Father. Oh god. Father. - Its name. It must reveal its name. - What is your name? Tell me your name! S-h-a-i t-a - I have no name. What's the matter, sweet potato? Can't you say my name? Oh god. Light. Come on. - Little girls shouldn't play with fire. - Amy? - Do you wanna know my name, little girl? - Amy! - Remember me, Gordon? How's faye? - Amy? You're okay, you're okay. - Gordon. Gordon. - You're okay. Yeah. - Remember me.
