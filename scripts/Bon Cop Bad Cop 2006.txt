What can I do for you, buddy? - I heard this rumour that the Toronto team might be sold to Houston! - That... that rumour, not! - Listen, I know it's 100% accurate information. It comes directly out of the mouth of my brother-in-law. - Don't give me the brother-in-law, don't give me the cousin! The taxi driver, the bartender, Uncle Mike, my brother-in-law. Your brother, your cousin... Who cares about the bullshit? The real rumour is, a bloody team from Canada will be sold to the U.S. (buzzing) But it's not Vancouver, Calgary, Deadmonton, Taranna, Montreal. - Yeah, well, you know, Ron, since the lockout things have been going... - Lockout? What lockout? What's the problem with the lockout? (buzzing) - You know, Mr. Buttman, with all that cheap American crap like cheerleaders and mascots and... - Yeah, you're right about that. Don't hate the cheerleaders, but I can't stand the mascots. Can't stand the mascots, with the tail and the frou-frou. Can't stand the mascots! You want to know what else? - What? - In the end, who cares? Because of the lockout, we've got ourselves a final between Montreal and Toronto. Yahoo! So don't believe the rumours a Canadian team is moving south. (man coughing) But it's the end! The beginning of the end. Finito, kaput, the end. Thanks a lot. Next caller. - What's going on here? What is this? Why am I tied up? What am I doing here? What did I do? - That's the problem, Ben. You didn't do anything. - You know I tried to help. You know that, right? Right? You know... I didn't want to drop you... Let me go, we'll work things out. Untie me! Let's help each other, eh? You were like a brother to me! - Shhh-shhh-shhh... - Ah! What are you doing? Where are you? - Shhh-shhh-shhh... The game's on. - Ah! ...a new highpoint in Canadian hockey history. The Holt Cup final between the Toronto Loyalists and the Montreal Patriotes. The referee is ready to drop the puck. And the game is on! (radio): Toronto's never looked sharper, the European refs have never looked duller! Which leaves Montreal. Remember when Montreal had Frenchies that could score? Well, those days are long gone. - Well, thanks, Tom, for your usual amazing insights into our national psyche. Frenchies that can score, eh? Europeans? What a country this is on a fine day in May! - Hey, bud! Morning! - Ahem. No food. - Where you going? - Back to my room. - You're not hungry? I got some great new cereal. - I'm not in the mood for shredded cardboard right now, thanks. - So, Jonathan, how was last night? The DJ thing. - It was good. - Yeah? You had fun? - Uh-huh. - Morning, boys! - I've got this thing at work. It may be overnight, so Auntie Iris is here, okay? - Hey, hey! - Hey! - But I'm hoping that won't last too much longer. I'm hoping to be a DJ man myself, you know? - What's that? - DJ man! (imitating a turntable sound) - Oh, God... - Desk job, get it? Desk job? Heh! - Yeah... - Jay, come on, where you going? Tell me something good, please, after that. - Okay, last night I was spinning. - Yeah? - Everyone was going crazy! People were on the tables! - Hell, yeah, they were. - So the next guy went up after me, but no one really liked him, so they called me back, 'cause they wanted me. - Nice. The girls must've been all over you. - Uh, yeah. There was a redheaded girl... - A redheaded girl? - Yeah... - Just asking. - You know what? Jay, let's go grab some breakfast. Outta here, you know? Me and you, shoot the shit. - Okay. - Give me the juicy details... Get your stuff. - See ya! How do you do that? I can't get a full sentence out of him. - Come on, brother. He's 15. You're his dad. - I suppose so. - It's 22 degrees in Montreal... Hey, did you see last night's game? Toronto isn't giving up, so, hey, Patriotes, show us your stuff and bring home the Cup. - Oh... You're here. Wow. Aren't you sweet. - Good morning... to all of you. - Jerk. - Daddy! - Hi, sweetie. - Did a bad guy do that to you? - Daddy met someone even more hard-headed than Mommy. - You're funny. Good morning, sweetie. Did you sleep well? - Oh, French toast! Thank you, Daddy! - My pleasure. - Daddy, I have something to ask you. - Ah, okay. What's up? - Can I get my bellybutton pierced? (Coughing) - Excuse me? I want to pierce my bellybutton. - What did Mommy say? - She didn't even try with me. - Let me think about it and we'll talk later. - You're not cool. - Would you please go upstairs to my place and get some milk? - I told my friends you were the coolest father. - Of course! - Your cool thing is not going to work. Go get the milk, please. Thank you. - You can get your face sown up once a week but I can't get my bellybutton pierced! - I didn't say no, I said your mother and I will talk about it and then she'll tell me what we've decided. - You're not funny. - Now go get the milk or I personally will pierce your navel. (Gabrielle laughing) Go on. - Okay, okay. - Bellybutton piercing... What's wrong? - Nothing. It's just that if you could be like that for more than 10 minutes at a time, we might still be married. - Come on... Could be worse. Some couples don't even get 10 minutes. - Yes, but in between those 10 minutes there's always the job, women, the job, your pals, hockey, the job... (Hockey anthem phone ring) The phone. - Bouchard. Yeah? No, come on, it's my day off. - See what I mean? - All right, all right. I'm on my way. I have to go. But let's talk about this again real soon. - Say, when Gabrielle goes to university? - Is it that urgent? - Don't forget your daughter's ballet recital. - Honestly! Do you actually think I'd forget something like that? Suzie? - Huh? - When is it? - At 4:00. How do you expect me to find another man? It's hard enough having one child, let alone two. - Don't say that. You'll find somebody. Come on, you've still got great tits. - Run along now, go play cops and robbers, your little pals are waiting. - Jesus Christ, who's the idiot that had the road blocked?! It took me two hours to get to my own crime scene! For you, today I am DETECTIVE Dave! - Martin Ward. - David Bouchard. - Enchante. - Enchantay! Hey, we got somebody that can spick de French. (laughter) I guess he's the victim? - We can't classify him as a victim yet, but we can say he's had a bit of a rough night. Not much blood, though. - Well, it's been fun. Good luck, guys. - Hey, where you going? - Back home. This is obviously your case. - What do you mean, our case? It's very clearly your case! - How do you figure that? His feet are on your side. - Exactly. His head is on your side. What's your point? - My point? If you play football or tennis or whatever, you step over the line, you're out. Okay, boys. We're out of here. - May I remind you that in the 100-yard-dash, it's the head and chest that break the tape. In horse racing, it's by a nose. As you can see, the subject was a true Quebecer. - Do I need a passport? - His heart is in Quebec. And he's got Ontario up his ass. - Excuse me? - I just said his ass belongs to you. - Okay. We'll take it from here. Get me a ladder. - A ladder! - Whoa! Don't move him. - How can I? He's indented in the sign. - Never mind. Let's just get this over with. - What's this? - Be careful not to move anything. Ah! - Ah! - Careful! - Ah, shit. - Ah! Idiot! (creaking) Ahhhh! Argh... (groaning) Good morning. - Hey, nice turtleneck. It's really you. What the fuck is squarehead doing here? - David, you know Martin, of course, and this is his boss, Brian MacDuff from the OPP. - Pleasure to meet you. - Yeah, I'm sure. You wanna tell me why the hell I'm here this early? - You wanna talk, Brian? - No, no. It's yourjurisdiction. - No, no, no, I insist. - Okay. We know that the victim is from Montreal. - We know... the victim... is from Montreal. - We don't know for sure yet if it's a murder and if it is, where the murder victim comes from. - But we don't know for sure yet if it's a murder, or, if it is, where the murderer comes from. - So Captain LeBoeuf and I thought this would be a great opportunity... - So we thought, Captain Leboeuf and I, this would be a great... opportunity... - It's okay, Chief. I understand English. - Oh, shit... Okay. It's okay. David... can English. He can English. He can... - Oh! - Yes! - Okay, well, go ahead, then. - Okay, I go, I go. So we thought it was a good hoppor... - Opportunity. - It was a good... - Opportunity. - Hopportunity to be... - You may speak French, Captain. - Ah, for fuck's sake... - You speak French? - No, not really. I had a small gadget installed in my brain under people when they speak. Yes, I speak French. I was in enriched French at Upper Canada College. - Upper what? - I also lived in Paris for a year. - Ah, that's why you're such a snobby pain in the ass. - Hey... - Right. Thing is, we want to show the RCMP that they can't have the whole pie. - No, no. Okay... - And that if we can cooperate, it would be very good for our image and next year's budgets. - Yes! So until further notice, you're... ...partner. - You've got to be kidding. - This is a joke. - Listen to me, you! Based on what Sylvain told me yesterday, I'd worry more about getting suspended than who's my new partner. So if I were you I'd just shut my hole and solve this case as fast as possible. - I just went through a rough one. I can't work with this clown! - Just do it, Martin. You want that desk job, don't you? (phone ringing) - Grossbut. - Benoit Brisset is dead. - Excuse me? - His body was found at the Ontario border. - When? - We don't have much information yet. - That's not possible. Everyone liked Brisset. - Did he have any problems with his clients? - No, I don't think so, but I'm not familiar with all his cases. If he had a problem with a client, I'm sure he'd have told me. - No doubt, you've known each other a long time. - Long enough. We started working together on the Fleur de Lys. - That's true. - And we've been together ever since. Has the family been notified? - I have no idea... - If I can do anything... - I'll get back to you if I hear anything. - Thank you. - Hi, Michel. I've been waiting for you. - Ah! - That had to hurt. - Benoit Brisset, 46. Recently made partner at Grossbut, Canuelsberg, Tiernyskovitch & Brisset. Divorced, no kids. Three condos. One's in Boca, one in Nice. Works 75 hours a week, which I gather for Montreal is a lot. No known mob links. Member of Le Mirage Golf Club. Drives a Cherokee. Anything else you want to know? - Is he circumcised? - Yes. - Jeff, meet my counterpart from the OPP, Martin Ward. - Nice to meet you. - Salut. - I know at first glance he looks like a gay accountant. But believe it or not, he's not an accountant. - Gotcha. - Are you able to determine... - The height he fell from? Depends on the speed of the helicopter. - Who said anything about a helicopter? - Me, I could've sworn I just said helicopter. You see, an airplane goes too fast. He'd be cut in two, without your help. A failed parachute would still be attached. Hanglider straps are too complicated. You really have to want to kill yourself. The air-balloon festival hasn't started yet. If it was a stork, he would've been caught in a 46-year traffic jam. So, helicopter. But to reply to your question, 80 metres max. Or 236 feet, 4 and 7/8s inches for you. An inert body in free fall goes at 30 metres a second. Looking at this mess, I'd say a minimum of 25 and a max of 80. My feeling is that it's not 60. At 30 meters a second, the fall would take exactly 2 seconds. And that's too round a figure. I just don't feel it. Nothing in life should be so precise. Maximum 80 metres. - What about this? - What's tattoo in English? - Tattoo. - Tattoo? A tattoo? That's random. 2 T's and 2 O's, yet it's the long A that you pronounce. - Why is there blood? - How would you feel after a 200 feet fall? And a tattoo can take up to 10 days to heal. - I'd say this tattoo was fresher than that. A few hours at the most, it had hardly started to heal. "Pantutti" for you. - Then why... - Why didn't this part bleed? He started it 2 months ago and he just finished it yesterday? Bad answer. Ontario's turn to reply. Too long! It's the opposite. The part that bled was done while he was still alive. The other part was done after he was killed, you can tell by the pigmentation. He was dead before the fall, because there's also this. The coagulation of this wound corresponds to that of the tattoo. The wounds from the fall are more recent, the patterns are different. - So he was dead before he fell. But why a tattoo? A signature? - Makes sense. A tattoo doesn't fit his character. You don't wear $5,000 Armani suits, get made a law partner, go get a tattoo. - Why not? - Not very classy. - Angelina Jolie has tattoos. - My point exactly. The real question is why a fleur de lys with a scale? - Mm-hmm. - I could give you a thousand reasons. - One would do. - Hmm. - Maybe we should go ask his partners. Thanks, Jeff. - If I come up with anything, I'll call you. - Sorry, but I didn't get half of what he said. - Me neither! As long as we each got a different half, we'll be okay. - Uh-huh. Okay. Great. Thanks, Stefane! We're on our way! Change of plan. We can pay Grossbut a visit later. As we thought, there were no registered helicopter flights in that area. But a farmer saw a chopper flying low over his field and he identified it as being from Helicoptere Libellule, a small company at the St. Hubert airport. - Okay. So do we go see the farmer or go directly to the airport? - I think we go directly to St. Hubert. (punk-rock music) Jesus! What are you doing?! (honking) You can't do that! This isn't an official police car! There's no siren to warn people! - Roll down your window and make the siren noise yourself. (honking) Come on! (honking) - Oh! Look, we're gonna have to have some ground rules here. - No problem. Rule 1: In Quebec, I'm in charge. I take care of fights and car chases. - I see. That leaves jaywalking and traffic violations for me? - As long as no ladders are needed. - And no smoking. - That's your right. - Then why are you lighting up? - I have rights too. I'm in the smoking section. - This car is really you, you know? - Thanks. - Rule 12: You let me interrogate the witnesses. I do the talking. - Whatever, but in French. - Depends on the maternal language of the person we're talking to, doesn't it? - In Quebec, we work in French. - Fine! That leaves the rest of Canada under my jurisdiction, with the possible exception of some of New Brunswick. - Whoa! What did I just say? In FRENCH! - Sorry about this. I have everything right here... - Take your time, ma'am. How many helicopters do you have? - Three, but one is being fixed. Here's the page. No, none of our helicopters flew near the Ontario border yesterday. The owner has been with a group of Americans up in Tremblant the past week and Luc did a short return trip to Montreal around 2:00. But wait, that's strange. - What's strange? - Hey! - Sorry, interrogation. - What's strange? - I don't want to get anybody in trouble, but Luc seems to have taken a chopper out at the end of the day yesterday. Maybe it was to fix something. In that case, it would be normal for it not to be logged. - Do you have a number where we can reach Mr? - Therrien, Luc Therrien. At this time of day, he's usually at the bar on the corner. - Thank you. - The pleasure is all mine, Officer. Excuse me, but is there a number where I can reach you in case anything new pops into my head? - I don't have any cards with me. - Ah. (laughing) - It's 9... - Okay. - 1... 1... That's it. (laughing) They'll know how to find me. Ask for Martin Ward. - Ward... - I'm going to park in the back. - There we go. Luc Therrien. Thirty-nine years old, divorced. Nine years for smuggling cocaine. After that, nothing. Helicopter pilot for 10 years. With this company for the past 3 years. - Luc Therrien... I've heard that name before. Maybe I arrested him. - Wait, wait. I'm the one who asks the questions. - You're right and I'm gonna let you go in there all by yourself. I'll join you in a little while. - Good. You'll be able to study my methods and maybe learn a thing or two. - Yeah, right. - Let me go and size the place up, then join me. - What are you doing? Hey, no badge. Especially not one from Ontario. What the hell? - Anything else? Hello, handsome. What can I get for you? - A ginger ale, straight up, s'il vous plait. - Ginger ale! A little ice? - No, thank you. (both chuckling) I'm looking for a helicopter pilot. - We're not short on those around here. It's on me. - Why, thank you. Therrien. Does that name mean anything to you? - Therrien... - Luc Therrien. - Oh, Luc! This is your lucky day, that's him there. - Merci. - Tabarnac! Shit, man, you're lucky. Rita, two beers! - Nice jacket. - Thanks... Reverend. Nice turtleneck. It was a joke. Rita, give the man another drink. - Ginger ale? - Ooh, ginger ale. You worried about driving home? (all chuckling) - Do you know that the Canadian Heart Disease Association says that two alcoholic drinks per day can be beneficial for our health, but that three or more bring us ever closer to the grave? - Therrien, you've been dead for seven years. (laughing) - I drink to stay calm when people start to get on my nerves. - Ever tried yoga? - I know practically every position. - We all know your favourite positions, Rita. - Show the lady a little respect. - Winner buys the beer? - What planet are you from? - Toronto. - Oh, yeah? That's why I hate your face. What the fuck you doing here? - A poll. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Benoit Brisset. We know there's a link... - Argh! Let me ask again, do you know Benoit Brisset? It's fine. Argh! Oh! - Ah! - Ah! - Bouchard! Do something! Bouchard, help me! - Does anybody here understand English? I think the guy with the purple face is trying to tell me something. - David! Help me... please! - With pleasure. - Mind your own business. - Okay, you can let him go. I'll take care of him. - I'm not sure that's a good idea. - Martin, we talked about this. I'm in charge of fights. Take it easy, it'll be okay. - Argh! - Thanks. Has Mr. Therrien seemed at all nervous lately? - No more than usual. - Argh! - Martin, help me! - May I have a little lemon, please? - Anything for you, handsome. - Martin, stop screwing around. - Here's my card if you think of anything. I'm sorry, I don't understand you. - Fuck you! - Right language, wrong words. - Martin, help me, please! - Excuse me. Let go of my partner. What are you doing? I don't know if you don't respect procedures because you're ignorant, you're a lunatic, orjust because you're French. You can't do this! (laughing) - And what is appropriate procedure in such a case? - Hey... it's yourjurisdiction. - Thanks. - You motherfuckin' pieces of shit! - Hey, watch your language. - What did he say? - He called us rotten. - I got that, but "hostie de calice"? - It's swearing. "Hosties de pourris" is like fuckin' pieces of shit, but "hosties de calice de pourris" is like motherfuckin' pieces of shit. But I've been called worse. "Hostie de calice de tabarnac." - Over-the-top pourri? - Oui. - Laugh it up, assholes. When I get out of here... - Shush! Shush! Wait, I'm not finished. You can conjugate it, too. - Like a verb? - Mm-hmm! - I'll fuckin' give you one! - Good one, Luc. For example, I'll fuckin' give you one. Or you could use the masculine and say, here's a hell of a whack. - Got it. - You utter fuck. - Absolutely. As in I'll give you a fuckin'... We can also use it as a noun. We have expressions too! Like, I don't give a shit. - Okay, enough. You don't want him to file a complaint. - I don't give a shit. Come on. - Argh! - What's going on? Lulu, your boot is in the way. - Sorry. - I just hope you don't talk like that around children. - Holy fucking shit! Gabrielle! - I have my answer. This is a handicapped space! You can't park here. - Yes, I can, I'm with you. - Give me your car keys. - No. - This is ridiculous. We can't leave a suspect in the trunk of your car because you're late for your daughter's ballet recital. - Why not? - Let me out of here, you assholes. - Bravo, girls. Let's have a nice round of applause for our well-deserving girls. - You obviously have no kids. - I have a 15-year-old I raise alone! - Then don't tell me the asshole in my trunk is more important than our children! - That's not the point, Bouchard! Rules were made for a reason! - I don't want to hear another word about it. That's an order! - An order? - Yes. - Hey! - Excuse me, sorry. - Will you sit down! - I didn't miss Gabrielle? - No, you haven't. - This is Martin. He's from Toronto. He is working for me on a case. - My sympathies. - Delighted to meet you. - Ahem. - This is Suzie, my ex-wife. - My sympathies. - What do you mean? - Ahem! Thank you. Now that we have your attention, we can present our most advanced group, And they're nervous, so please encourage them all you can. - It's them! Gabrielle, let's go! Go, girls, you can do it. You too, Matthew. - Music! - Relax, Suzie. It's going to be fine! (classical music) Good start. - Yes! - Shhh... - Hey, that's not easy. Does he have to put his hands there? - Just relax. - That's my daughter, the one up front. Yessss. Beautiful. Here comes the finale. Yes! Whoo! (whistling) Yeah! All right! Way to go, pumpkin! - Bravo! - Matthew, you rock! That's my girl, centre stage. Today, you were fantastic. Your "pas de basques" were... wow! You stole the show. - We really have to go. - Daddy, do you have to go? - I'll be home for supper, I promise, we'll celebrate your triumph. Gimme a kiss. - Will your friend be coming too? - What friend? - Your employee. Would you like to come for dinner? - With great pleasure! - Fantastic. See you later. - Yes. - "Fantastic"? All of a sudden you're bilingual? - Hey. - I'll see you later, okay? Don't feel obliged to come, I'm sure you're tired. - On the contrary, I'd really like to come. - I think you should get some rest. - I've always heard you Quebecois were hospitable, but... Hey... Rita, the barmaid, left me a message. - So why don't you go eat with her? You know what they say about girls from Quebec? My car? That's my car! - I told you... - Hey! - Police! Freeze! - Hey! My car! - Police! Freeeeeze! See? Even in English, works like a charm. - Yeah, right! - We could've been in very big trouble. - You're so negative! - The suspect! - My car! - How are we gonna explain this? - For the time being, we explain nothing. (small explosion) - What? Are you crazy? A suspect has died in your car! We have to report this! - You're the nut case. What do you think your bosses will say when they hear that this happened as a result of your negligence? - My negligence? I told you, I could've brought him myself to headquarters, but you couldn't stand the thought of not being able to sit there, showing off in front of your pals! - If your procedures were so fucking important, why didn't you stay with the car instead of coming in and sucking up to get a free meal and flirting with my ex-wife in front of our child? - That's it. You're crazy. I'm outta here. I'm gonna write my report detailing exactly what happened and I don't care what you do, but you're not dragging me down in this shit with you! - It's too late, because you're already in shit. So if you want to save ourjobs so we can feed our kids, we have to shut up and find the sicko who did this. That's the only way out. - Shit de merde de shit de fuck de tabarnac! - 24 hours. If we have nothing in the next 24 hours, I'll explain what happened. - Not one hour more. (distant sirens) - Anyway... the case is moving forward. - At least now we know it wasn't him. What? It's true. Hey, you okay? - That was delicious. I really liked the way you did the salmon, French bistro style. I do it American style. - You cook? - Yes, I love to cook. - Apart from his famous french toast, David was never very useful in the kitchen. - No, but you found me more useful in another room. - Still, it's rare to see exes living together in the same house like a normal family. - Normal? - Are you divorced too? - Gabrielle! - No offence taken. Yes, Gabrielle, I am. - What happened? What? I'm interested. - My wife was working as the Governor General's press secretary and while she was in London on a Royal visit, she called me one day at work and told me she had met some sort of prince and she wasn't coming home. I never saw her again. - You're kidding, right? - No. - That must have been a shock. - Jonathan was 8. He spends Christmas and two weeks in the summer with her. - What's a semi-prince? - A rich guy with legs like a frog. (laughter) - Okay, bedtime. - But, Daddy, it's only 7:30! - Not you, honey. I was talking to Martin. Seriously, we have a big day tomorrow. - You're right. We have to go to Therrien's place. I should go. - Why don't you stay upstairs at David's place tonight? That way you can leave together early in the morning? - Suzie, my place is really a mess. - I know, Martin can sleep in my room and I'll sleep upstairs at your place. - It's settled! - We'll talk about your piercing later. - Barmaid's not answering her cell. - Where the fuck is the search warrant? - Did you take Ritalin as a child? - Huh? - Try thinking about other things. Your daughter is adorable. - That's true, we're really lucky. She's a great kid. - You were right. Quebec women are... special. - Are you talking about Suzie? - She is really superb. She's really down-to-Earth. - What are you trying to say? - What? - This isn't working. - Bouchard, we're waiting for a warrant. - I don't give a shit. - Bouchard! Come on! - I don't give a shit. - Great, now we can't use any of the evidence. (sighing) Idiot! - Shit... Martin! Come look at this. - Not without a warrant! - Ah, come on, I already broke in anyway. I thought I saw someone in distress. - Goddammit! - Ha! (laughing) - Would you try not touching any more of the evidence? - It was worth it just for the look on your face. (buzzing) What a sick fuck! Now I get why Luc Therrien's name rang a bell. I remember. He was drafted by the Fleur de Lys. Played half a season for Quebec before getting busted for dope. - That explains the tattoo. - Mm-hmm. So this is all about hockey, or drugs? - Maybe both. - That's Grossbut. - Hmm... - You know him? The jerk who sold Quebec to Colorado. - The next year, they won the Cup, right? - Blah, blah, blah... (camera flash) (camera flash) All right... you finish your little arts-and-crafts project. I'm gonna check the basement out. (soft music) - David! Grossbut is here! - Martin! Come see this. Jackpot! (dialling phone) - This is Detective Martin Ward. We have a dead body here. - Hmm... (rapid beeping) - Shit! David?! What have you done now? - This is good! This is really good! What the fuck's he doing? Taking pictures of the fire? (swearing in French) Ah! Why does this shit always happen to me? Ow! Shit! If I get out here alive, I swear I'm gonna ask for a desk job. - David!!!! David! (gunshot) - Ah! (ringing) (coughing) - What the hell's that smell? (coughing) (screaming) - Martin! - Here, get Grossbut out. - Never mind him. - No, no, get him out of here. - Let's go. (coughing) - You all right? - Yeah. - Gimme some of that. - It's my inhaler. - What the hell? I feel kind of weird. - Me too. (distant sirens) (laughing) (swearing in French) - That's not good, right? - Jesus Christ, David! You went in without a warrant. You put a suspect in your trunk. All that's left of him fits in a sandwich bag. Do you think that's normal?! - Don't go crazy. He had a record as long as your arm, he's not exactly Brother Andre. - Brother Andre! - We have to pick him up with a spatula! Then you burn down a house with a victim inside! - Don't forget my car. - Don't interrupt me when I'm talking! - In fact, Chief, it was all my fault. I thought I spotted someone inside in distress. There was someone in there, but not who I thought. He was in distress... but not today. It's close enough. Huh? - Captain MacDuff, line 3. - Captain MacDuff. You got my message about what you crazy cop do? - Yes. - He burned down the building! He blew up... the witness! - Martin, is this true? - Well, uh... with regard to the situation, sir, I think one could characterize the case as, uh... What was the question? - Witness! Witness! - Oh, no, I have a halibi. I was at David's daughter's ballet recital. - What? - Martin, you come home right now! We'll talk about this later. It's not our business! Now get back home! - Good, I'll be better off not having to drag a tourist around. - Listen, sir, let me fix this. Because I'm spending half my time babysitting Rambo on steroids. I can fix this. - SHUT UP!!! And you... you crazy son of a mad cow, from now on, you're off the suitcase! Off the suitcase! You go to Ontario. That's it, that's all! Don't call us, we'll call you! Huh?! It's over. Over. OVER! (chuckling) And you. You. All I want from you is to take this squarehead to the airport. That's your fucking job for today. - Roger, come on... - Out! Out! - This way. - Get out of here! Get out! Get out! - I've got the munchies. - Oh, what can I say? It's been an education. But two victims, Quebecois. One witness, dead, Quebecois. One killer - I'm guessing, wild one now - Quebecois. So, bye-bye. Tell Suzie I'll email her. - What's your deal with Suzie? You've only seen her twice! - You Quebecois are all the same. You got some lunatic who's gone nuts over a hockey team that doesn't exist anymore. And you with Suzie? "Je me souviens." You're living in the past. You got to get over it. - Yeah, well, at least we're alive, not like you and your freakin' queen and her fucked-up children - one of whom stole your wife, by the way. - Did anyone call a taxi for the airport? - Your lift is here. - I did. - Can I take your suitcase? - No, thanks, I'll be right there. - But you're right about one thing, The only piece in this story that doesn't fit is you, so bye-bye. - Tune in to my pre-game show later tonight. We're gonna talk about these rumours that a major Canadian team is moving south, which really pisses me off! All of you know I hate Montreal! I hate the team! But what's the point of hating Montreal if they're in Houston? Also we have a big surprise guest for you: Mr. Pickleton. You don't want to miss this, because I won't miss you! - You seen anything like this? I can't believe it. - You've got to be kidding. - Recognize her? - I think I recognize the lunatic who did it. - Martin! - Where you think you're going? - Get your hands off me, asshole. - Oh, say it isn't so. - I'm a cop. - You can't pass. - I know that guy over there. That's my friend, Martin! Hey, it's me! Tell these guys to let me through. - Okay, you can go. - It's okay, he works for me. Hey, hi, how are you? Hello... - He's from Quebec. - Ah. - Did you miss me? - Show him. - Tabarnac. Well, you could say he's a hell of a skater. It's a Quebec hockey expression. You know who she is, right? - Martina Flabcheeks. Thanks. - The first female hockey agent. Her first client was Quebec's 1st pick in '95, but he never signed with them. Everyone thought it was his decision, but it was his parents and her. She wanted him to play in Toronto... but he ended up in the States. - Well that makes perfect sense. Of course she deserves to die. She wouldn't let her client play in Quebec 10 years ago. I suppose some people still aren't over the Plains of Abraham. Incidentally, aren't you supposed to be speaking English? - Where's the tattoo? - Right here. - Hmm. Who's next? The client? - He's safe. He's under guard in a New York hospital. When we phoned him to give him the bad news, he fell to the ground, got a concussion. - Again? - Hold her skirt. - What? - Hold up her skirt. You should be good at that. Good. (camera flash) Okay. So Brisset screwed Therrien, who played for the Fleur de Lys, so he gets a fleur de lys with two scales on either side. Grossbut sells the team to Colorado, so he gets a mountain tattoo with two eights replacing the first two Os in Colorado. - 88: Flabcheeks's star player's number. He's been playing us from the beginning. The tattoo isn'tjust his signature. It's a clue to his next victim. - And 88 goes to Philadelphia. - Philadelphia... With two missing letters. L. A. - L.A. Los Angeles. - The best player in the world. - The Great One. - Or the one who sold him. (rousing theme music) - Okay, this is the situation that I find myself in. It's not bad enough that Montreal is leading our team 3-2 in this series, but right now I have a guest, Mr. Pickleton, who has not shown up. And why? Because some lunatic is out there killing members of the hockey community. - Pickleton's in the building. His limo's here. He must be on his way. - Did you talk to security? - If they see anything, they'll call me. - Shh! Shh! - What about the cowards that want to abolish fighting in hockey and make hockey look like golf. I say we go after them! While we're at it, why don't we allow Annika Soren-what's-her-not and some of her chick golfer friends to lace up the skates and go play for the Montreal Patriotes in time for the playoffs. What's the big deal? They only make the playoffs once every 5 years. What? Can you believe this? My director is now asking me to talk about last night's game and to stretch, because our no-show guest Mr. Pickleton, a man who I have waited over a decade to ask straight up why in God's name he would sell the world's greatest hockey player out from under us, apparently, he's in danger! Boo-hoo! And I've got two cops in the corner who won't tell me a thing about this lunatic. Can we see these cops? Can we get a shot of them? Hi, guys. How you doin'? So maybe you have something to say on the subject, so call in and talk to me on the air and tell me what you think about... The Tattoo Killer. - What? - And cut! 90 seconds! Make-up! - Mr. Berry, I'm sure you know yourjob... - Don't tell me how to do my job. - You can't talk about the killer on the air. We don't want to provoke him. And branding him "The Tattoo Killer," that's publicity, just what these guys want. - I can talk about whatever the hell I want to talk about, because I have a lot of time I have to fill. Can someone please get this fruit away from me? - Okay, thank you. Bye-bye. Tom, you good? Coffee? Yes? - No, I don't have a guest! How am I good? - Can someone find him a guest, please? Okay, people, we're back in 5, 4, 3... - Welcome back. We have two very special guests in the studio to talk about... The Tattoo Killer! With us from Ontario, Detective Martin Ward, and from Montreal, David Bouch... Boucha... Boucherville, Bouchie... One of these French names I always screw up. Men, are you any closer to getting this jerk? - Well, Tom, I don't think we can say categorically that he is a jerk. What we do know is that he works very fast. And though we don't want to sound alarmist, we think it would be a good idea if those people in the hockey community were careful. - Careful? What does that mean? - Well, to respond to your question, Tom, uh... the best way to be prudent would be to change your hapitudes. - Your habitubes? - Habits, Tom. That's a good point, David. The killer seems to know the habits of all his victims and is using that knowledge to capture them. So it might be a good idea to change your routine. - Yeah, what I'm wondering is, why do we have a French cop on our turf? I mean, is this killer not challenging enough for you? - Keep it up and you'll regret wearing those ugly ties. - Come again? - He just said: "What a sharp dresser you are!" - No, I said go on with your stupid comments about me and you'll regret those ties. - You want a piece of me? - Are you hitting on me? - Tom, caller on line 1! - Okay, apparently we have a caller on the air who has some very important information. Caller, you're on the air. What's your name, please? - Tattoo Killer. - Ha-ha. Very funny, but we just don't have the time. - You have a problem with my quest, Tom? You think you can do better? You think I'm just a jerk? - I don't think you're a jerk, I think you're a flake or a fake. - Shut the fuck up. Mr. Pickleton is getting his tattoo now. - Let me talk to him. Unfortunately, Detective Ward, Mr. Pickleton can't come to the phone right now. He was moving too much and it was impossible to make a nice tattoo. And by the way... sorry about your car, David. - Sir, we're going to hang up now. If you'd like to talk to us, we're going to give you a number that you can call us at. - Don't you fucking hang up on me! I know your names and faces. So don't worry, if I wanna talk to you... (laughing) ...believe me, I'll find you. - Hang up the phone. - I don't think so. - You're either with me or against me. - Watch it, frog! - You are trying to stop me in my heroic attempt to save our national sport. When I get finished with all the moneygrubbers and scumbags who sold our game to Americans, who couldn't care less... - Stand back! ...about the art of hockey, I'll come after you and those two cops and everyone else who gets in my way! If you think I'm going to let my game become less important than bowling because of a couple of rich... (dial tone) Fuck! - Listen to me, you sick fuck. You want to talk, call me. 514-555-5594. - Ah! - Pickleton can't be too far from the limo. - If he's still in the building. (phone ringing) Hello? - David? You want to talk to me? - Keep him talking. - Yeah. What will you do with him? - Let's just say... ...I'm going to leave him on ice. - On ice? - He's on Bouchard's cellphone. Try and trace the call. I don't care! Just trace it! - Don't you speak French? - When I feel like it. And now I don't. - I'm understand everything you've done, except for Benoit Brisset. Why him? - He's the one who loved Colorado so much. - How come you have such a strong accent in English and French? Who was your teacher? Jean Chretien? Funny. Real funny. Time's up. - Fuck. (banging) (muffled yelling) - It's the police! We'll get you out. - It's unlocked. (muffled yelling) Tattoo gear. Easy, easy. - You all right? - I'm fine, thanks. - Who are you? - I drive the Zamboni. - Where is it? - Down there. - Let's go. - Take care of this, guys. (crowd cheering in distance) Police! Freeze! - Shit! (rock music) - Shit. Go, I got Pickleton! Hey, come here! I need some help! - Fuck! - Police! Out of the way! - Hey! Whoa! - Police! Out of the way! - You fucking Frenchies! You run like you drive! - Out of the way! Ah! Ah... - Excuse me! Police! Excuse me. Excuse me. You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Easy, easy. We know Pickleton sold 99 to L.A. And here we have the U.S. Dollar sign and a big apple which brings us to New York. - You're sure it's New York? - Well, New York money for sure. - I don't know. There's nothing Canadian about it. - Call the New York FBI to warn them a maniac might be headed their way. - Maybe we should go down there. - Why? You gonna burn down the Empire State Building? Blow up Times Square? - He's prejudiced, isn't he? - What did he say? - Just ignore him. What do you want us to do? - Work with what you got. As long as there's no body bags in my territory, I don't give a shit. - Talk about a shitty week. If he's going south, there's nothing we can do about it. I'll probably lose my job over this. Lost my car... The good news is, it can't get any worse. - You're right. Let's get out of here. You want to come home for dinner? - Why not. - Don't do me any favours. Can you hand me an endive, please? Aha! Rosemary. Endive. Endive, s'il vous plait. - This? - Yes, that's it. - The guest room is ready. - Thanks. Would you set the table, please? - Do you have any beer? - I don't, but I might have some cognac. - Aunt Iris bought some yesterday. It's in the fridge. - All right, so where's this hunk who saved my big brother? - Aunt Iris, this is David. David, this is Aunt Iris. - Okay... Um... just Iris is good. - Enchantay, Just Iris. - Enchantay to you! - Ah! It's nothing. - Are you adopted? - 'Cause you can see the difference? - Want a beer? - Thank you, baby. - Maybe Toronto isn't so bad after all! - I don't know what that means. (whispering): It means he wants to have sex with you. (chuckling) - Come on, it must've hurt. - No. Itjust felt, like, this big electric shock. I was waiting to die. But nothing. No pain. Huh, Martin? Isn't it true? If the bullet goes right through, it can take up to 10 minutes before you start to feel any pain. - I usually try to solve most of my cases without getting shot. - What happened to the guy who shot you? - I shot back. He was dead before he hit the ground. But because of the bleeding, I started to feel, uh... etourdi. - Dizzy. - Dizzy, that's it. So I'm, like, "Okay, let's go outside, get some fresh air and wait for the back-up." So I handcuff the dead guy, head for the backyard. - That seems almost cautious. - What? - Handcuffing the dead guy. - Yeah, I know. But the night before that, I saw "Fatal Attraction." - Oh, yeah. - You know? She's in the bathtub, you think she's dead... And then... argh! Yeah. So I didn't want to take any chances. So I'm in the backyard, light up a smoke, try to get some air, and tout a coup... - All of a sudden. - All of a sudden, the dead guy's dog jumps on me. And, I mean, he's mad en tabarnac. - That's really, really bad. - Is he bullshitting us? - I don't know. - It's true, swear to God. Look, I have a scar. (laughing) So I'm bleeding like crazy, I'm fighting the dog with my, uh... mains nues. - Bare hands. - Yeah, that's it. - Why didn't you just shoot it? - The dog was only doing its job. - Exactly. So last thing I remember, I had the dog in a headlock. - Oui. - And we both passed out. A few minutes later, the back-up arrives, they find the dead guy with handcuffs in the living room and me and the dog in the backyard, endormi en cuillere. - Spooning. - Lucky dog. (glass tinkling) - Jonathan? (gun cocking) - If you're such a hotshot cop, show me where your gun is. - Search me. - Jonathan? (gasping) (gunshots) Argh! Argh! (grunting) (groaning) - Dad! - Argh! - Leave my dad alone! - Argh! Tabarnac! Sorry, kid. Argh! (grunting) - Teach me something else. - Leo et Lea go to school. - Leo... - Et Lea... - Leo et Lea... - You all right? - Yeah. That was cool. - Thanks! That was great! (panting) - What else? - Long live a free Quebec! - What's that mean? - Oh, Jesus! Bouchard! - Vive le Quebec libre! Oh, long live a free Quebec! Long live a free Quebec! (moaning) Oh, Quebec... uh, Quebec free... (moaning) - What the fuck are you doing here? - Iris, it's for you. - Of course it's for me. It's my... Hey. Oh, God... What are you guys doing here? - I saved Dad's life. - From what? Cardiac arrest watching curling on TV? - From Therrien. He's alive, he was in my house. - What the fuck are you talking about? - I kicked his ass. - He got away. - You're sure it was him? - Yeah, I'm sure. - Why would he try to kill you? - He was trying to kill us! He had no idea you'd be with my sister. - So who was in the trunk of my car? - I don't know, but the body's in Montreal, and Therrien is here. (phone ringing) - Last call! Last... Allo? - Jeff? - Yes? - It's Dave. Have you identified the body that blew up in my car? - I was just working on it, Do you know how much overtime I'm doing because of you? It's like a 5,000-piece puzzle that you lend to a cousin and it came back half-empty, 'cause there's a piece in the sofa, there's another one stuck to a sock in the dryer... - Jeff, I don't have time for this. - If it was a guy in your car, then the operation was a complete success. - What are you talking about? - The guy was a girl. I didn't have a DNA match, but late yesterday I got some dental records. So I gave her a toothbrush and she's really happy now. - Jeff, who is it? - Hold on a sec. Her name is... Rita Beaumont. Rita Beaumont. Not a really interesting name, is it? - Rita, the barmaid? Thanks, Jeff. - Hey, by the way, you know that... Rita spelled backwards... Uh, never mind. - Thanks, Jeff. - No problem. - That would've been helpful to know. - Fuck. She was trying to call you, that's why. Therrien must've known and gotten rid of her. - No, no, no. Therrien was in the trunk of the car. He would've had to have broken out of the trunk, stolen a car, driven back to the bar, grabbed the girl, grabbed a bomb that he prepared for that purpose, driven back to your car, put her in the trunk, and then rigged the bomb? The show wasn't that long. - He's not alone. (phone ringing) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) - Allo? - Suzie? - Oui. David? Nice time to call someone. - How's everything at home? - Fine. You sound strange. Have you been drinking? - No. No. It's just... I don't know. I'm a little Ionely. Can I talk to Gabrielle? - David, she's sleeping. Like normal people do at this hour. - I know... I... I just need to hear her voice. - What aren't you telling me? - Please, Suzie. - What is it? - Suzie! - I'm going, I'm going. I'm upstairs. She slept in your room. She misses you too, you know. Gabrielle... Gabrielle? Gabrielle! David, the door is open! She's gone! She's not here! I put her to bed earlier and now she's gone! (phone ringing) David! David, answer me! - Hello? - David? - Who is this? - Oh, it's Detective Ward. I have a call for Mr. David Bouchard from his daughter. Is he available? - If you touch my baby, I'll kill you, motherfucker! - Your daughter is fine. Gabrielle, it's your father. - Daddy, come get me, please! I'm scared! - Gabrielle! - Daddy, help me! - Shut up! I have nothing against your daughter. But you are really starting to piss me off! - What do you want? - I assume that a smart fellow like you would know who's next on my list. Stay out of my way. Let me do my grand finale. And after that you'll get your daughter back. Safe and sound. - My daughter has nothing to do with this. Take me instead. - True. And it wouldn't be right for anything bad to happen to her. Because of you. (laughing) (crying) - Suzie... (Suzie screaming) - What is going to happen? Tell me, tell me. What have you done? Don't touch me. Get your hands off me! I want my daughter! Do you understand?! If he touches her... If he does anything to her, I never want to see you again! - I'm sorry. (both crying) I'm sorry. - Bring back our daughter. Bring back our daughter. - Okay. - Is she okay? (car approaching) - Salut. - Salut. - Everything you asked for is in the car. - Thanks. - Can I do anything else? - Stay with Suzie, okay? - Hey, Mike. - Hey, Stef. - We have to go. Let me drive. - Give me some privacy. - Okay, boss. - Hey, is this press conference going to happen or what? Some of us have deadlines. If you want us to write about this before next season starts... - Sorry for the delay, everyone. Mr. Buttman will be here any minute. - You sure you want to do this? - Remember, it was my idea. I just don't want to read about it in tomorrow's papers. - Mr. Arbusto! - Hey, Buttman! - So nice to talk to you again. - Everything coming together? - Sure is. - I don't want you to misunderestimate how grateful I am. I'm sending you our agreement right now. (fax beeping) You're doing a wonderful thing for hockey. 'Cause I'm gonna make hockey as Texas as a big, fat American steak. None of that poison Canadian shit. - You're going to enjoy having a top hockey team in your state. (knocking) I'm busy here! (knocking) Just a sec. (knocking) You idiots! Who the hell are you? - Buttman? - What's going on? - What the hell's going on there?! - Get in the bag. - Buttman? - In the bag? - In the bag. - How does this work? (muffed yelling) - Have a look at this. - Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me? Aha! Are you talking to me? Me? That's good. Goddamn it! FUCK! Are you talking to me? - Hip, hip, hip, hip! Go! - Argh! Ah! - Good. What? - Ah! - Don't you know who I am? I'm gonna sue your asses! You can't put me in the trunk of a car! - Yes, I can. It's a Quebec tradition. (muffled yelling) - Okay, I'm in place. - Shit! Hey, hey, hey... - A photo with the children... - Get away from me! Take your kids away. - How rude! - Take care of your own kids. - Excusez. Testing... 1, 2, 3... - What do you think you're doing? - Police business. Your attention, please. Mr. Buttman will not be here. He's had an unfortunate contretemps, and therefore, the press conference is cancelled. (cellphone ringing) If there's any more information before tonight's final game, you'll get it. We will keep you up to date. - What's this delay about? Is he trying to make fools of French Canadians? - Notjust the French. I don't think he much likes Canadians, period. No further comment. They're all yours. - Ladies and gentlemen... ...we apologize for the delay. (phone dialling) - How'd I do? - Great. You're being followed. Don't turn around. - How many? - One. The Patriotes mascot. Lead him towards the garage, I'll follow you. - Got it. Okay. - Ah, for fuck's sake! FUCK! Goddamn it! (elevator bell dinging) (muffled yelling) (cellphone ringing) - Bouchard. - I told you to stay away. Do you want one last word with your daughter? - Wait. I have Buttman. If you want him, he's yours. All I want is my daughter. - You're pushing your luck, David. - Yeah, yeah. Do we have a deal? - The Old Port. The tower at the end of the pier. You have 15 minutes. - You could lose yourjob over this. - I don't give a shit. (ship's horn blaring) (cellphone ringing) - Yeah? - Bring him inside the boat. - You're not done with me yet, asshole. - Hey, welcome home, Therrien. You were born to be a mascot. - Hey, stop stepping on my tail for Christ's sake? - Shut the fuck up! - Where the fuck is my player? Stop right there. Where's Buttman? - Change in plans: Give me my daughter, you and your buddy can go free. (muffled yelling): Daddy! - Shhh... You see, I'm a man of my word. - Daddy, I don't like it here! - Daddy's here, sweetie. - Don't cry, baby. It's almost over. - Oh, you're so cute. So you think this is a fair trade? That's not what we agreed on. You should've brought something valuable to me. - Fuck... - Daddy, I don't like it, come get me! - Close your eyes, Gabrielle! - Come get me! I don't like this! - Close your eyes, Gabrielle! That's it, keep them closed until I tell you to open them. - Throw me your gun. Now! - You're fuckin' crazy! - Oh, David... he was a fucked-up loser I found on the Internet. He wanted revenge on those who screwed up his hockey career with the pros. And me... I just gave him the tools to do it. Easy enough. After that it was easy to get him to kill the other fuckers! They destroyed our "Great Game." - It's just a game, kid. - Give me your car keys. I guess Detective Ward has my package? I hope he's not too far. - Martin! Bring him! - I'm coming! (muffled yelling) He won't kill you here. He needs a crowd and you need a tattoo. Get moving. - Too long! - Don't touch her. - Dad! - In four minutes... it blows! - Martin, move! - We're here! We're here! - Give him over. There's a bomb on Gabrielle. - Walk over there. Walk over there! Move! (muffled response) - Okay, now you give me my daughter. - Not until Detective Ward drops his gun. Not yet, David. Not yet. Don't you push your luck! Fuck! - Daddy! - Martin! Okay, baby, open your eyes. You can look at me. - Take it off, Daddy! I don't like this! I'm scared. - I know. (muffled yelling) - Move! - Take it off. Do something! - I need you to be still. You can't be moving like that. - Do it! - I need you... - Do something. I'm scared! - We're going to do this together, okay? - Don't touch it. It might be booby-trapped. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Here and here. It's a pretty simple device. Bombmaking 101. - You know what you're talking about? - I was Bomb Squad before Jonathan was born. We're gonna have to pull out these two wires simultaneously. You'll have to do it. You need two hands. - Daddy! - It'll be okay. - Orange and yellow. - You sure? - Three... - Wait, wait... Okay. - Three, two, one... - I love you. - Pull. - Move! Okay. Okay. (muffled): No, not again! - Go get him. - I can't. - I'll take care of this. - Go, Daddy. Go and kick the shit out of him. Thank you. (gunshot) - Ah! - Oh, shit! - Oh... - Ah! (gunshot) (muffled yelling) - Ahhhhh! (gunshot) - Argh!!! - Ahhh! - Daddy? (groaning) - Wait! - My father! - Take this. Call your mother, I'll help your father. Stay here, okay? We'll be right back for you. Stay here. - Dave... Iook at the state you're in. You should've taken care of your daughter. And let me... take care of Buttman. - You talk too much. - No! Don't! Don't do it. It's not necessary. - What? He tried to kill us and our kids. He'll come back. - All good things come to those who wait. - What are you talking about? You didn't... You can reset those things? - I prefer to think of it as recycling. - You sure it'll work? - We'll soon see. Man, can that guy run. (beeping) - You gotta be fucking kidding me. - Wow. - Yeah. (muffled yelling): Come on! Get me out of here! - Oh, shit, the penguin. Gabrielle? - In conclusion, I would like to put an end to the rumours that any one Canadian team or another will be moving to the U.S. I know how important hockey is to you people, so I am spearheading a rule change to ensure that no Canadian team will ever have to move from its home city! (reporters clamouring) No more questions! Thank you. No more questions!
