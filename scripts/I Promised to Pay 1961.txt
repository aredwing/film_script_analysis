We're just trying out a new security device. You can turn it off now. Switch it off, Frank. - Gives 'em quite a turn, doesn't it? Remarkable, Mr Parker. Absolutely remarkable! There isn't a thief alive that can crack our system. Try to break into the van - it sets off the automatic tape and it's impossible to drive off unless my partner operates the dual controls and he's locked in, so no one can get at him. I tell you, Mr John - your payroll's as safe with us as it is in the bank. A hundred thousand quid, eh? Well, it's far too good for the poor people! Same route as three weeks ago. These boys are in a rut. We could out-run them - even in this hearse. I dunno - I don't like it. Too damn la-di-da about it. They've got guns, that's why, ain't it, Monty? Well, they don't worry me none - I'm on National Health. Oh, this is the spot that always makes me feel nervous. What a pushover! Wonder nobody's ever pulled it before! That's it for today, boys. Mmm? - Why does... HARRY: Jackie? I'm up here, darling. Come on up. HARRY: We've done it! It's as good as fixed. HARRY: Hello, you two! Hi. - Oh, mind, darling. She'll fall. Aren't you pleased? - Yes, of course I'm ple... Oh, Jeremy, you'll be sick! Look, get that soap from him, will you? You don't seem the least bit excited, Jackie. - Of course I'm excited darling... ...but these kids have been absolute little beasts all day. Susan went and fell into your precious manure heap... ...which is why I'm bathing her early. Hey, come on, sit up, huh? Wheee! HARRY: It'll make us, you know. Oh, mind, darling, he's just had his tea. Sorry. If we do alright with Kneales... ...we'll soon get the other big companies interested... ...and Kneales alone is practically enough to double our income. How do you make that out? Well, you see, we get paid a commission on the amount we handle. And Kneales' payroll is well over a hundred thousand pounds. Aren't you scared? - Why should we be? Why, if it was a hundred million it would be just as safe with us. What d'you want to meet in a place like this for? Did you get it out of the telly or something? I thought it was a good idea. You said it was dangerous. Oh, blimey, I thought you accountants had to have brains to keep your jobs. Well, you want to try using 'em. Two cars parked in a layby - two blokes sitting in one of 'em - somebody sees 'em and thinks at once 'Hello, I wonder what they're up to'. Start driving. We'll talk while we drive. Next time we meet, you bring your missus and I'll have some bint in tow. And while they're having a bit of a natter, you and I can say our piece. There isn't going to be a next time. It's all off. You trying to bitch me? No - it's out of my hands! They've taken me off the wages run. Why? Because they're putting in a whole new system - it's an armoured van. It's a tank on wheels. They demonstrated it for us this morning. It's got everything. Steel enforced, bullet proof, police radio hook-up, everything. It's - oh, it's foolproof. - Nothing's foolproof. When does this van start on the run? Maybe in time for next Friday. I don't know for sure. Look, I could contact you if they decide to hold it over another week - and then next Friday... - Not a chance. Why not? - Because it stinks! The final day of the old system? It'd have 'inside job' written all over it. That's true. You needn't think it's because of you! It's not! It's for me. They start to put any real pressure on you, and you'd crack. Right - now who was who sold your Mr John this bill of goods? A fellow called Parker. - Parker? Right. Well, if we decide to take on this Parker lad's outfit Kneales needn't really come into it at all. No, it could be that we got on to Parker direct. Yeah, I like that... it confuses things. Yeah, the more I think about it, the better I like it. You mean you'll take on an armoured van? - Why not? Do you think I'm going to let this stop me? Not me. I've worked on this too long. Nothing's going to stop me now, nothing. All right. Then you do it without me. Now listen - we don't need you! It's better if we have you, but if we don't, we don't. But God help you, Pearson, if we come unstuck! 'Cause I'll put the finger on you, sure as fate and you won't even have had a penny piece out of it. WIRELESS PLAYS FRENCH ACCENT: You're late. - Er... yes, I'm sorry. Is anything the matter? - No... no, nothing. You're nervous. Er... you're imagining things. - My foreign blood again, I suppose. Er, what would you say if I said we'd go for a holiday to Majorca this year? I'd laugh. - No, no, no, I'm serious. I'd laugh. Ha ha ha ha. Like that. Now go on and say we're going for a holiday in Majorca this year. I don't see what's so ridiculous about the idea. No! Nor do I! I think it's a marvellous idea. But what do we use for money? - I... I can get the money, it's as good as fixed. Do you see my scissors anywhere? - To hell with your scissors. Aren't you even interested? - No. Oh, for crying out loud! - That's right! For crying out loud. I'm not in the least bit interested. And shall I tell you why? Look, all I said was... - Because I've heard it before. All the things you were going to do for me - when I was a silly young girl. And out of three occupying armies, I chose you to marry! You were going to get a senior post at Kneales - only they gave it to someone else. I told you at the time... - You were going to start up in business with - what's his name - only it never came off! Look, that was his fault, not mine! - It's always somebody else's fault! You think I like sitting up half the night, making dresses? You think I get a kick when I've managed to save up enough to pay the gas bill? Well, I don't. Do you hear me? I don't! When you get the money - show it to me. I don't want to hear about it - just show it to me. I want to see it, feel it, smell it, spend it! Do you understand? Spend it! Don't worry. I'll get it. Bravo! DOOR SLAMS An armoured van! Well, that's that then. We can write the whole thing off, if that's the case. Blackie? Well, if Bert won't go it, what do you expect me to do? What's the matter, does he do your thinking for you, as well as run you around here? Look, if it's like you said, it seems to me we don't have the option, Johnny. Look, they've thought of everything. We - we'd be bashing our heads against a brick wall. Anyway, it's all right for you lot but I've done time... ...and I don't mean to do any more if I can help it. BERT: Look, you'd have to do your nut... ...to start knocking flippin' armoured cars around, I can tell you that, mate. You're all of the same mind, are you? Looks like it. - Well, that's not it! I'm not wasting all of these months of planning! Armoured van or no armoured van we're pulling off this job and we're pulling it off good! So, what's the plan, eh? - I'm just coming to that. Well, you'd better - because all the rest of it is a waste of breath. Do you want to run this business, Bert? No, Johnny, I - I didn't say that. All right then. Now, look. There's plenty of ways to foul up an armoured van. All we need is the layout to the box of tricks. And how do we get one? - There'll be one at Kneales'. Uh-huh, and to get it, we just send them a self-addressed stamped envelope, eh? No, Blackie... It'll be delivered - by hand. BIG BAND PLAYS What a place to meet anyone. KATIE: Who is this Jonny Mellors, anyway? He's starting up a new business. I - I may tie in with him. I see. Another one of those. DANCERS APPLAUD He's a much better dancer than my husband! Do you dance, Mrs Pearson? - Yes, when it's the right music. Oh, well, tell me what tune you like, and I'll get them to play it for you. Not right now. Will you excuse me? Excuse us. Did you bring the plans? N- not in here. - Why not? Well, someone might hear us. - What, with all this noise going on? I - I - I couldn't get them. Why not? It's impossible. There's always someone in the... - Now, you listen to me, Pearson! Your Mr Mellors has quite a way with him. Oh, he's not my Mr Mellors - I've got a husband. Oh, I see... - Sure you do. You got any kids? - No. You? No. I'd have a kid at the drop of a hat, only my husband's in America. And he took his hat with him? I don't see how I can do it. Now look, I'll give you twenty-four hours to get those plans, you understand? Just twenty-four hours. It's too risky. - Everything's risky. Getting up in the morning is risky or going to bed at night. Well? You boys taken over the coal mines? Hmm? Oh, yeah that's right, isn't it, Pearson? Well, er, what about that dance now, Mrs Pearson? 'Scuse us. - Mind you bring him back! MUSIC: "It happens every day" by Tony Osborne Do you think sex is here to stay? I can't breathe. Mr Mellors, is this the regulation distance? Hmm... Well, er, that depends on who's doing the regulating. Mr Mellors, has anyone ever told you you belong on a leash? Hmm. Will that be all, Mr Pearson? - Yes, yes, thank you. Good night. Still at it? Yes. I, er, got a bit behind in my work. I thought I'd stay late and catch up. I know what you're up to, me lad. Well, proving to the 'powers that be' how industrious you are. Well, good night, Dennis. - Night. TENSE MUSIC Oh, Mr Pearson! I've got to copy these right away. Well, I've got a lot of work to do... - Mr John is waiting for these. Oh. - You don't mind, do you? TENSE MUSIC Have you nearly finished? - I won't be a minute. I'm late for my date as it is. There you are, Mr Pearson. It's all yours. Thank you. Good night. - Good night. Still at it, Pearson? - Yes... Yes, I, er... I shan't be long now. Good night. - Good night. JOHNNY: They turn first - then park facing North. Make a note of that. - Check... BERT: Cop situation as before. Yeah. Huh-huh, look at them! BLACKIE: Hey, cut the natter, lads. Have you got no respect for a hundred thousand quid? They bolt the wheel-lock first, then the outer lock. Driver in. The guard throws the switch that completes the circuit. From now on, she's live. Turn on the radio, Monty. RADIO CAB VOICE: All drivers in the vicinity of Northumberland Street and Haymarket... You've got the Radio Cabs. Tune it in properly. RADIO CAB VOICE: All drivers in the vicinity... BERT: They're moving! One minute and ten seconds. DB4 here. Come in, please. POLICE RADIO VOICE OVER: HQ to DB4. Receiving you. Over. FRANK'S VOICE OVER RADIO: DB4. Leaving the bank now. Nothing to report. POLICE RADIO VOICE OVER: Roger. Listening watch. Out. Route B. Yeah - well, we can assume they'll vary the route each week. Then what's the point of following them? Because those boys think they're safe in that sardine can. They'll get over-confident. And that's when we move in - with a can opener. How're we doing, Frank? All clear behind? FRANK: There's normal traffic, but, er... ...there's been a Land Rover behind us since the bank. He's steppin' it up, you know. JOHNNY: Well, stick with 'im. Gawd, 'e's movin', isn't he? Eh? MONTY: Like to bet on a horse that can move that fast! Is it still there, Frank? - Still there. Better buzz the cops. Be casual. Better to be safe that sorry. Okay... FRANK'S VOICE OVER RADIO: DB4 to HQ. POLICE: Come in, DB4. Over. Present location, Shepherd and Whitehouse Street. FRANK: Look, there's a Land Rover behind us, seems to be following. Hey, that's us! - Johnny? Pull away. BRAKES SQUEAL Oh, it's a false alarm. Sorry, it's turned off. A fat lot of good these are! - Watch it! All right - what do we do then? Oh, Harry, it's beautiful. You really shouldn't. Our first big cheque from our first big customer. Oh, I do love you. And you spoil these kids. They've got far too many toys already. Oh, well. Easy come, easy go. Hey, Kneales aren't paying you that much, you know! In fact, they're not paying you enough for the job you're doing. What does Frank say? - Oh, he's happy. Well, Madge was saying she wishes you were back on the smaller runs - like cafes and shops. I think I agree with her. - Look, someone's got to carry the big stuff. For us it's the only way to make any real money. Money isn't going to make me any happier, darling. Oh, you just wait until the other big firms get interested. Then you'll see what a difference it'll make to us. Yes, that's the trouble with money. It means different things to different people. SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS Good evening, Mr Mellors. - You're late. I wasn't sure I'd come. But you're here. - I haven't much time. Oh, sure. Er, cigarette? Please. Where's Dennis? Working late, so I slipped out. What happens if, er, he gets back before you do? Then he'll be home alone, won't he? Huh-huh. Well, you sure picked yourself a winner. Dennis says you and he are considering going into business together. Mm-mm. - How did you get on to him? Through a friend. I didn't know Dennis had any. How come we haven't met before? - Well, I travel around quite a lot. Restless type. What sort of deal do you have with Dennis? Oh, there'll be a fair split in it for him. How much? Well, that depends on the profits. You ask a lot of questions. I hope the thing works out. Dennis isn't very lucky. Oh, he's in luck now. You seem very sure of yourself. - Yeah... ...I know a sure thing when I see it. What sort of business are you in now? - I sell. Do you buy? No. Not now, Mr Mellors. I have to go back soon. Why did you come? - To get a better look. Well, I may not always be available. Tragedy. I'll be in touch. BRAKES SQUEAL JOHNNY: Right now. It's going to take a bit of engineering work, but nothing that you can't handle, Bert. It's like the old saying - the irresistible force meets the immovable object. JOHNNY: Something's gotta give. YAWNS LOUDLY Did you say something? - Yeah. Yeah, when are you gonna get down to it, eh? You think you're pretty tough, don't you, Blackie? You think I open my mouth too wide, don't you? You think I'm all talk and no action, don't you, Blackie? How would you like some action now? Oh, leave him alone, Johnny. He runs off at the mouth. You can't help it, can you? Huh? All right, all right. Right. I'll tell you what we're going to do. Now then. First off, we're going to need two cars, two trucks, and something to jam the radio. JAMMING DEVICE WINDS CAR ENGINE REVS Right, now I'm going to go through it once more to make sure that there are no slip-ups. Now, first of all, Blackie, you take your truck and you park it there on the bridge at 10:25 on the nose. JOHNNY: If you get there any earlier, you might attract attention. If you get there any later, I'll break your neck. Okay? Right, now Bert, you and Monty will take your truck and you'll pull in here on the viaduct at 10:30 exactly. In the meantime, I shall have been down to the bank to make sure they haven't changed the time they pick up the money. Then I shall come here in the jag, five minutes before the armoured van is due. Okay? Now, Bert, when the armoured van passes you... ...you pull out and keep close behind him. If you think that he's on to you, make sure that you jam that radio. Right, now I shall be hiding behind Blackie's truck... ...and when the armoured van comes to pass, I shall drive straight at him from here banking that he'll pull over to miss me. And you, Bert, coming up fast, ram him into the back of Blackie's truck and you keep ramming until that armour splits. HARRY WHISTLES JACKIE: Harry! Breakfast! Just coming! Not all over your face, darling. Come here, let's wipe this off. Eat your breakfast. Oh, Harry, please, not before breakfast! Daddy, Daddy, 'ting gone. - JACKIE: She means the spring's gone. You show that to Daddy. See. Head won't spring back. Must've had a rough night. She's been pestering me to mend it ever since she got up. Madge phoned. - Frank all right? Frank fine, Madge bad, end of bulletin. I'm going to go round there and calm her nerves later on. Hey, stop gulping your food. It's getting late. - No it isn't. You've plenty of time. Daddy, no 'ting! I'll tell you what. Daddy'll take teddy with him... ...and if Daddy has time this morning, Daddy'll fix the sting. Spring! Do you want your daughter to grow up speaking Pidgin English? TENSE MUSIC Waiting - all the bloody time - waiting. Waiting for Johnny. Waiting for him to give us the word. Waiting to get started. Well, I've had waiting! You're nervy. Who says I'm nervy? - I say you're nervy. What do you mean by that? - All right, all right, I'm not blaming you. Anyone would be before a do like this. D'you reckon this deal will come off, huh? Hey, you. How the hell should I know? What do you reckon yourself, then? I think we'll come unstuck. Isn't he the Cheerful Charlie! HORN BEEPS Now, don't worry. The doctor said there'd be days you'd feel a bit depressed. Get a move on, Frank! Come on. I'll be home early tonight. Jackie'll cheer you up when she comes over. How is she? - Depressed. Everything okay? - Yeah. Stuff as heavy as this - soon slip through the fingers! How's Jackie? - Oh, couldn't be better. Sits on her backside while I take all the risks. Risks! Huh! My dear old mother takes more risks when she hangs out the washing! BRAKES SQUEAL Damn! Here, what do we do? - Huh? We get out of here, that's what we do! Back! Back! Come on! Come on! - Yeah. What do you think I'm doing? All right! Steady! Steady! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! BRAKES SQUEAL HORN BLARES Hold it! - Yeah. What do you think I'm doing? TRAFFIC BEEPS Hey, copper, Bert! - Huh? Now, what the hell do you think you're doing? What? If I don't get this load to the factory on time, sir, it'll be the sack for me! I thought I was taking a shortcut. Look at the mess I'm in, huh? Of all the stupid... - Yes, sir. Monty! Below us! Johnny'll have us for this! He worked out the route! It's his damn fault! Well, I wish I ruddy well hadn't come! Frank? - FRANK OVER RADIO: Yes? We sat there for ten minutes. It's time they did something about that bridge. Shall I report the delay? - Mm. Might as well. Frank, what's it like in the back there? Stinking hot. What I couldn't do to a pint. HARRY OVER RADIO: Oh, me too! Tell you what. We'll slip out for a quiet one when we've dropped this lot. All right, Frank? All clear behind, still? There's a truck coming up like a bat out of hell! BRAKES SQUEAL It's following us around! I may be crazy but... I think it's coming after us, Harry! I'll see if I can lose it. Johnny! Monty - Monty, the wheel! Okay, okay. We've got them now. Is she still coming, Frank? - She's gaining on us fast, Harry! Call the police. Hurry. DB4 to HQ. FRANK OVER RADIO: DB4 to HQ! - Jam it, Monty! POLICE OVER RADIO: HQ to DB4. Receiving you. Jam it! POLICE: HQ to DB4. Over. JAMMING MACHINE WINDS Can you hear me, HQ? Can you hear me? STATIC There's something wrong with the channel, Harry! The alarm, Frank. Start the alarm! ALARM SOUNDS TAPE RECORDER VOICE: Help! Bandits! Help! BRAKES SQUEAL GUNSHO Bert's been hit. - Don't worry about that. Take the money. Johnny! They're coming! Come on you - move! Take these. I'll shift Bert. Get going! Hey, Johnny! Give me something to smash the glass! Close the window! I think he's bought it! Monty, pull yourself together! GIRL: One of them's dead. Pinned to the wheel - right through him. 2ND GIRL: What a dreadful thing! Let's take a look at Bert. Here. He's in a bad way. He's had it. We should get him to a doctor. Doctor? Are you barmy? What would you tell him? We oughtn't have moved him. - What, leave him there to sing about us? Bert would never have grassed on his pals. Would he have, Blackie? - No, never. Look - you can't leave him here alone to die. Who's gonna stop me? - I am. If you leave him here alone, Johnny Mellors I'm going round to the nearest nick and give myself up. Straight I am. Look - I mean that. And get yourself topped? What do you mean? I ain't killed anyone! Look, in case you didn't know, killing that driver was murder and you're an accessory! If you give yourself up, Monty, you'll swing, sure as Christmas. I'll never forgive you for this, Johnny. - Look, I didn't kill him. Ah come on - what's the use of nattering about it? That's right. We've got work to do. Well, there's no point in worrying about it, Monty. You'll be better off, Monty! We'll split Bert's corner three ways. I won't touch it. - Ah, you'll feel different later. Is that all? - Yeah. Come on, Monty. It's time we got out of here. Go and open the gate. What about Bert? - He's a write-off. MACHINE WHIRS What is it, Pearson? What's the matter, aren't you well? Er, no, no, I'm afraid not, sir. I know what you're thinking. If this had happened when you'd been on the wages run... Ah, well, there but for the grace of God. Why don't you go home, get some rest. We'll see you tomorrow. Thank you, thank you, sir. Make certain you get a statement from all the eyewitnesses. Yes, sir. We've lost a fair bit, one way and another. Come on, Monty. Snap out of it. Come on, snap out of it! We're all in this together. At least you could have rung up about Bert. Rung up? What for? Tell them where he was. So they could send an ambulance for him. Now, look, Monty, so far, we've got away with this! We could all just as easily be sitting in the cells. Yeah. Or in the morgue. Yeah. I'm not having the police messing around in that lockup. Hey, wait a minute! Just thought of something! Now what? - Well, if this place doesn't open up... ...people are going to start asking questions, aren't they? They're going to start asking what happened to Bert. He's gone away. They'll be suspicious. All right, they'll be suspicious! What do you expect me to do about it? Well, if they start coming in here, asking questions... Look, if you don't want the money, don't take it! Okay, hold it! - But don't keep going on at me! You make me sick, sick, sick! What are you looking at me for? You think I wanted Bert dead? It could just as easily be me or you or any of us! All right? It was Bert and he's dead and I'm sorry. But that's the finish! Susan's just hit the kid next door. That's all right. We're not on speaking terms anyway. Well, when the mother finds out, you may be. Briefly. Come on, Madge, cheer up. Frank'll be home soon. DOORBELL RINGS There you are! Oh, hello - remember me? I'm a friend of your husband's. Oh, you're... - Detective Sergeant Bradden... ...Mark Bradden. I'm afraid there's been an accident. A very serious accident. Jackie! Oh, Jackie! - What's the matter, Madge? Mrs Moore... Mrs Moore... - Don't touch me. ...your husband's seriously hurt but he's alive. What about my husband? Here. Hey, wait a minute, you. What's the matter now? - You've twisted us, that's what! It was agreed you get twice as much as we do but you don't get twice as much of Bert's share! What do you say? I've already told you. I won't touch a penny of Bert's share. Blimey, you're the most awkward bunch I've ever struck. All right then, if that's the way you want it, Blackie and me'll split Bert's share. Is that what you want? CAR HORN BEEPS Who's that? - You reckon that's the law, eh? No, you never hear the law blow their horns. DOOR RATTLES Go and see who it is. Can't you read, son? - I've an appointment with Mr Lang... Look, it says 'Closed for Repairs' and 'Closed for Repairs' is what it means! We're shut. Now, look here... - Look, you must have the wrong date. He's away. - But he said... - We're shut! Hooligan! Nit! RADIO NEWSREADER: One man was killed and two others severely injured... ...when a van carrying the company's payroll was attacked by bandits on the outskirts of Newcastle this morning. The driver of the van received fatal injuries when his vehicle was rammed. His assistant was struck down by the bandits and sustained severe head injuries. The raiders are believed to have got away with over fifty thousand pounds. BLOWS RASPBERRY James Paddock, an engineer employed by the firm whose wages were stolen made a gallant - Well, now we know the score, don't we? Right, well, I'll go and park the car then. Monty. Don't let this business with Bert throw you. And remember, that money's hot. One note, and we could all come unstuck. Right, then, Johnny. And Monty - remember, as agreed, we lie low and trust each other. Might take weeks or months, but I'll let you know when I think we're in the clear and you can drink yourself stupid. He's shaky - really shaky. Yeah, well, they were good pals, weren't they, eh? Yeah. You took it well. Better than I expected. But, Blackie, now that Bert's gone, you'd better move into my place. Overlooks the river. It's safe there. Yeah, okay, Johnny. Well, you'd better go and get your clobber together. It's time we got out of here. It's all right, Blackie, don't worry. I don't steal from the poor. CAR REVS Well, intensify all road blocks. And put a special watch on diversions. Is that file ready? - Yes, sir. Mrs Parker's outside, sir. Well, put it off until tomorrow if she's too upset. She doesn't seem to be upset at all. I don't get it. Not a tear. She's the iron maiden herself. She's probably still in shock. I've seen it before. TENSE MUSIC Dennis? What are you doing home this early? Aren't you well? N- no... - Do you want me to get you anything? No. N-no thanks, nothing. What's the matter? I don't know. Look, it'll pass. Just leave me alone. Please. It wasn't anything to do with the robbery, was it? Robbery? Dennis, you must tell me. What is it? - Leave me alone, I tell you! The children are in bed. They had a good supper. Frank's going to be all right. I'm glad. Jackie... - I'm all right, Mark. I'm just a little tired, that's all. - I kept something in the stove for you. I don't really feel very hungry. It's very sweet of you though, Madge, what with Frank and everything. I was glad to have something to do. Well, I may as well go to bed... Do you mind taking Madge home, Mark? Oh, yes, of course. I could be right back... No, no, I'd rather be on my own. I'll come by in the morning. Harry... Oh, Harry... Oh, darling... Darling... BOAT HORNS SOUND KNOCKS Who's that? - Who d'you think? Hello, Johnny. We've made the front page. See? Yeah, well, don't let one whiff of fame go to your head. Inspector Carberry interviewed the widow of Harry Parker at great lenth yesterday but there was little in her statement to aid the police in their investigation. Ah, what could she come up with? Over one hundred employees at Kneales have been interviewed today. The enquiry continues. Wonder how Pearson's taking it. Now, I understand you've been employed here for several years and have given excellent service in that time... ...but until yesterday, you'd never missed a day off work. Well, even the most exemplary of us - even policemen - may commit indiscretions from time to time. Now, what I want to ask you, Mr Pearson, is this: Have you at any time discussed the firm's security arrangements... ...with anybody not actually engaged in that work? Oh, no. No, definitely not. CARBERRY: You're quite sure of that? - Oh, yes. And you never happened to mention anything about it in an unguarded moment, perhaps? While you were drinking in a pub, say? Er no. No I don't drink very much, so I'm not likely to let that affect me. I see. So you've never talked about it to anyone? No. Not even to your wife? Well, you know how it is, I... I had to say something, I mean... Well, it wouldn't have been fair if... ...if anything had happened. But that's ridiculous to suggest that... - I'm not suggesting anything, Mr Pearson. I'm here to find out the facts. Now it's obvious that whoever did this job had access to inside information. Either from somebody in this firm or from associates of Parker and Moore. And that's what I'm here to find out about. In any case, I don't suppose you told your wife about these new arrangements. Oh, no. No, just that the job was being taken over by another firm, that's all. I see. TRAIN WHISTLES How long for? I... want to leave it a few days. A week, maybe. That all right? Sure. What name? - Er, Smith. How much? - Ninepence. Ta. - Thank you. SUSAN: I want my teddy bear. Stop going on about your teddy bear! I told you, I'll get you another one! You go outside and play, darling. I don't know what's the matter with me, Madge. I can't even stand the children any more. I hate the house, I hate the district... - Easy, Jackie, easy. They'll get caught, you'll see. Yes, they'll get caught, won't they? They'll send them to jail for a few years, and then they'll let them go free. Well, that's not enough. It's not enough for me. They're not going to get away with this! No one's going to get away with this! Look at it, eh? Just sitting there. All this loot and we can't spend a penny of it. Only a few days and already it's burning a hole in your pocket. I told you that sitting it out would be the tough part. Well, I want to see some life! I don't call this living! Oh, shut up. You've got more years in front of you than I have. In other words, you haven't got anywhere at all. Thank you. We're pretty sure there was a contact on the inside. Jobs like these are planned months in advance. Harry and Frank had only been working for Kneales a few weeks. Meaning? Someone tipped of the gang about the new method of picking up the payroll. I see. Carberry asked me if Harry knew a man called Pearson. Who's he? He works in the wages department at Kneales. He had a dizzy turn on the morning of the robbery. Not that there's anything unusual about that, but until then he'd never missed a day's work. Carberry had a hunch. Had him under observation since Saturday. And? Nothing much, so far. - Is that all you're gonna do about it? What else can we do? Well, perhaps we could bring the tail out into the open, that might get results. But either way, we've got to wait. We've got plenty of time. Oh, yes. Yes, we've got plenty of time, haven't we? Harry's dead. There's no need to rush any more. Jackie, these things do take time... - Who is this man, Pearson? Where does he live? Here, now, I've told you more than I should be telling you. You leave it to us. How are the kids? The kids? Oh, haven't you heard? They're orphans. TENSE MUSIC MALE VOICE ON TELEPHONE: Avery, one three seven two. Is that the Mr Pearson who works for Kneales Motor Works? MALE VOICE ON TELEPHONE: Sorry, you have the wrong number. PHONE RINGS Hello? JACKIE OVER TELEPHONE: Is that the home of Mr Pearson who works for Kneales Motor Works? No, it's the home of Mr Pearson who ain't done a bloody day's work in twenty years! PHONE RINGS Hello? Pearson? - Yes, speaking. JOHNNY OVER TELEPHONE: I think you're under observation. There's a van across the road... ...Now, listen. Don't let them see that you've noticed... ...They're probably just trying to panic you into contacting somebody. If you sit tight, you're in the clear. Have you got that? JOHNNY: You're in the clear as long as you say nothing and do nothing. Now, er, I've got a little present for you. I don't want it. - JOHNNY: What do you mean you don't want it? I don't want anything more to do with this business. JOHNNY: You're going to get it whether you like it or not. You can't get out of this as easy as that. Johnny? Johnny, are you there? TENSE MUSIC PHONE RINGS Hello? JACKIE OVER TELEPHONE: Is that the home of Mr Pearson who works for Kneales Motor Works? Yes. One moment, please. For you. A woman. Hello? KATIE: What's that you're reading? DENNIS: Oh, it's just a note. - Who from? A chap I know. He said he'd bring some plants for the garden. Plants? - Yes. What sort of plants? - Plants, that's all! Just plants. Are you going to plant them now? Katie... Katie, I'm sorry I've been so bad-tempered lately. I... I've had a lot of things worrying me. Such as? I... I can't. I can't. Katie... Don't touch me. - What? Get out. You disgust me. You make me sick. Get out. Get out! Anything for me? Must be going. I shall be late. What about your breakfast? - Oh, there's no time now. I'll get some coffee at the office. TENSE MUSIC How's Monty, hmm? Oh, he's still on about Bert. He's worse than before. Is he on the bottle? I dunno do I? 'E wouldn't let me in to 'is room. Well, as long as he stays there we're all right, aren't we? Anything new on us? - Nah, nothing. That's the trouble with this case. No sex angle. PHONE RINGS Go on, answer it. What? I said what? Wrong number. You sure? - Nobody answered, did they? PHONE RINGS Mr Mellors? Who's that? - KATIE OVER TELEPHONE: Katie Pearson. What do you want? - KATIE: I want to see you. Why? I want to have a little talk with you. JOHNNY OVER TELEPHONE: What about? I'll tell you when I see you. Yeah, well, I'm pretty busy right now. I think you'd better. All right. I'll pick you up in about an hour. At the bridge. Pearson's wife. - Aye aye. You know, there's only one trouble with this job. No sex angle. I know you did the job at Kneales. You don't seem surprised. Well, if you can still be surprised by the time you've reached my age, you haven't really lived. What are you going to do about it? What do you mean? Well, you're not going to the police, that's obvious. Otherwise you wouldn't be here. So what is it? Blackmail? Not exactly. You've got nothing working for you, Katie, I know that. Even if I was to admit the whole thing to you here and now, you'd still be no better off. I've got more than that. Like what? You shouldn't choose a confederate who talks in his sleep. Oh. So that's it, is it? Well, how was I to know? I've never slept with him. I've got all the details. How it was arranged and everything. They can be checked. You'd never stand up to it. Well, I'll say this for you, kid, you've got plenty of nerve. You get into this car with me, alone, and then tell me you know enough to get me hanged. What do you expect me to do? Smack you on the bottom and send you home? Here's a quiet place. Now talk. Have you ever wondered why I married Dennis? Maybe once. Not since. To get out of Vienna, away from the ruins. Oh, I thought maybe he'd make something of himself. But I gave up hoping when he gave up trying. We have had separate rooms for the last... That's how you heard him talking in his sleep, I suppose! You don't have to defend yourself against me. No? Come on. Get out of the car. Hiya, Monty. - Get me a scotch, mate. Make... make it a double. What are you 'aving, mate? BARMAN: Oh, ta. Half of mild, please. Oh, look who's slinging his lolly about like that! Wotcher, Doll. What's the matter - ain't we good enough for you these days? Aren't you going to treat us then? Same again. Well, where've you been, anyway? I've been around. Here and there, you know. Fill her up, mate. - And a tonic. 'Ere, Mont. Heard a good one the other day. There was this widow, married to a parson, see... Do you know what I wish? - What? I wish Dennis was dead. Why? It would be good for both of us. You can't trust him. You haven't seen what he's got like these past few days. He's going to pieces. The least little thing, and he'll crack. I know him. You said good for both of us. Well, for me too. Isn't that obvious. Well, you could always just leave him? How? I've no money of my own. With Dennis out of the way, I'd at least have a few things - the house, even if it's mortgaged, the car, the furniture - not much, but something. That wouldn't get you far. No. I want to come with you. Don't you want to take me? Well, I've always had to sort of, er, go it on my own. Not because I wanted to but... Yeah. Sure, I want you. We can't be together while he's still alive. Huh? Now, look, Katie, it's not as easy as all that! I... need to have time to think about it. Look, in the meantime, you... you keep a check on him. If he starts doing anything foolish, call me. If Blackie answers, he's all right. - Who is Blackie? Now, listen, darling. You already know more than is good for you. Let's just leave it like that, shall we? When shall I see you again? - I'll be in touch. Tomorrow? Well, I don't know. I don't know what might come up. All right. DENNIS' VOICE OVER: Pearson. Do you think you're getting away with it? Yes, I've got the proof all right. Do you know why I haven't used it yet? Because that would make things too easy for you. I'm going to make you sweat. PHONE RINGS Hello? Who is that? Speak, damn you! Speak! DENNIS OVER TELEPHONE: Speak! ARCHIE: But I didn't steal no quid, Mum! Then what are the coppers doing here? Archie never stole nuffin' in all 'is life. We're not accusing him of stealing it, Mrs Murdock. Mrs Aysher sold him a poundsworth of sweets. - What? And you paid for them with this note. Now, we just want to know where you go it. Well, where did you get it, Archie? - I didn't pinch it. I found it... ...and I can show you where I found it. MRS MURDOCK: There you are, you see!

Look, it's right here in black and white! - Let me see. JOHNNY: Doesn't say where or how. Monty. Here, you get over to Monty's, see if he's been spreading it around. I'll check the garage and the lockup. - Do you think they might have found Bert then? How would I know? Get over to Monty's! - Right. Chronicle, please. Aahh! There you are! Look, I'm in a hurry, Miss Biggs. - So was that friend of yours who just left. MRS BIGGS: Terrible state he was in, too. Huh. Says you're to call Johnny right away. There. That's what he told me to tell you. A thank you'd be appreciated! Now look, Johnny, if they've found out about Bert, that's our lot! We've gotta get out of here! That makes us pretty hot. What about Monty? His landlady said he'd been out all night. - What did you say? Look, I've told you once. His landlady said he'd been out all night. I don't care what she said. You've gotta find him! If he's gone on a bender, we're sunk! There's no telling who he'll be shooting off his face to! You've gotta find him, and find him fast! What about you? - I've got plenty to do here. Look, if you think I'm going to do your dirty work for you, mate... Now, you listen to me! You get over there and bring him back here!

Two pints o' wallop. - Good. What's this then? Er, that's mine. Gimme that. What is it? It happens to be worth a fortune. Is that right? - Yeah, we can see... It's worth a fortune. - Well, let's have a gander then. Here, I can't see! - Hey, come here! What's this? Central Station! Why, it's only a Left Luggage office ticket, that's what! Well, now, fancy having us on like that! If you don't give me that back, there'll be trouble! Hey! Hey, stop it! Well, I always wanted to light me fag with a fortune!

BLACKIE: He's 'ad a bit of a punch-up, hasn't he? - JOHNNY: Yeah... Looks like they've cleaned him out as well. All right, grab his feet. See what he's got left - if anything. Did you find anything? - No, nothing. Only this letter. Who's it from? I dunno it's, er, addressed to some solicitor. Well, then it must be on he wrote, you stupid nit! Go on, open it up. What's it say? It's a beaut. He confesses here to taking part in the raid, and... And what? Says that you organised it, and you're a dangerous nutcase! I never thought Monty had it in him! He's coming round. - Pity. Where am I? - You're at my place. You want a drink? Er, no, no... Now, listen, Monty, we're clearing out of here. Things are getting too hot. Look, if it's all the same to you, I'll have some shut-eye. Look, you don't follow. You've got no choice. MONTY SNORES Monty, wake up! You're coming too, so you'd better get your money. Where is it? Oh my God - the ticket! Ticket, what ticket? Left Luggage ticket. I lost it. What the hell's he on about? Look, if you don't talk sense I'll smash your face in! Look, I am talking sense. The money's in the station. What's all this about a ticket? I ain't got it any more, Johnny. It's the honest truth. Two blokes in that boozer set fire to it! All right, Monty, I believe you. Thousands wouldn't. Right, you'd better get some shut-eye. You really mean that, Johnny? - Sure, why not? You ain't mad at me then? What have I got to be mad about? Only that letter... - Shut up. What are you gonna do? You'll see in a minute. Hey, Monty. Wake up, huh? Here, come on, I've brought you something to drink. Mm? - Here. Now come on, come on, finish it up. It'll make you feel better. That's it. Ta, Johnny. GLASS SMASHES Well, that's that. - What do you mean, that's that? I mean I've done him, that's what. - Huh? Goodbye evidence. No tears, no fuss, no mess no nasty bloodstains. What did you give him? - What does that matter? Come on, let's go. - Yeah, but where? To get rid of him. You hump him down to the car. I've got to go and get some tools. What are you waiting for? Shut the boot. This'll do as well as anywhere. Get the spade. What did you say? - I said get the spade. You're gonna do the digging, Johnny. Put it away, Blackie, it might go off. - Go to hell! Look, you've run things long enough, Johnny. I'm sick of being pushed around by you. I'm through, d'you get it? Yeah, I get it. So get the spade then. What'll you do if I don't? Shoot me? We could just sit here like this all night, couldn't we? Until the cops find us. BLACKIE: Oh! Oh! Oh! All right, Blackie, that'll do. He's gone! - I thought you said he was dead? Don't just stand there, stupid! He can't have gone far. We've gotta find him.

I want the truth. The truth, d'you understand? You're having an affair with someone, aren't you? What are you talking about? - You're having an affair with someone! What on earth gave you that idea? - This did. Read it. Go on, read it. You know! You know all that I've done! I did it for you. Katie, I did it for you. For me? You snivelling, spineless coward! You've done nothing for me. You're damn right I'm having an affair - with Johnny Mellors! Johnny Mellors! Now, listen to me. I was a good friend of Harry's. And I'd do anything to see that those who killed him are brought to justice. Yes, a few years in jail, hmm? I think it's on the cards they'll hang, but that's for the law to decide. But I said justice, Jackie, not vengeance. Pearson hasn't reported these letters to you, has he? You're putting me in a lousy position, Jackie. I should report this to Carberry. I want you to. Because if Pearson hasn't reported these letters, then the obvious thing is to find out why. If you're wrong, it could be unpleasant for you. You could go to prison. Are you sure you want to go through with this? I'm positive. The money! The money, you're burning the money! You're burning the money! FIRE CRACKLES Yes, I'm burning it. All of it. All of it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it, I tell you! Stop it! Stop it! I hope you won't regret this, Mrs Parker. I did, once. But then I kept on thinking of my husband, you see. I felt he'd been forgotten too soon. I couldn't possibly let that be his epitaph. The Pearson house, sir. It's on fire! I'll kill you! I'll kill you both! - Let me go! GENERAL SHOUTING Calm down, sir. Calm down. DISTANT FIRE ENGINE RINGS Johnny! Johnny! The police have Dennis. He found out about us. He became a raving maniac. He tried to burn the money! Right, get in. We gotta get out of here. How'd he find out about us? - We've been seen together. Who by? - How should I know? It was in the letter. An anonymous letter. He's had several. That means somebody's on to us. I keep telling you, I wasn't running out on you. I was going to contact you this evening. - Where from? Greece? I had to move fast! - Lucky I had to move faster. A CAR PULLS UP CAR DOOR SLAMS FOOTSTEPS OUTSIDE CAR ENGINE STARTS Brensham. That's the Marthella over there. - JOHNNY: Looks okay. Right. We'll be setting off about 5.30 in the morning. You'll have the tide then. - Fine. See you in the morning then. Why can't we go tonight? Well, it's safer navigating these waters by daylight. Oh, come on, relax. We'll be on the continent tomorrow. Drink? Here's to us. Long life and prosperity. Don't forget freedom. And long may we enjoy it. What about the absent friends? That's a bit too near the bone. You're looking terrific tonight, Katie. Love me, Johnny. Love me. BRADDEN: Sir! - Yes? Look at this. Must've arrived today. Damn. We're out of water. - I'll get some. Katie? Katie? Sleep, Johnny. Sleep. Where are you going? Away, my pet. Far, far away. JOHNNY: Huh? You oaf! Clumsy oaf! You think I didn't know you were trying to run out on me? Two can play at that game. I knew you were too good to be true. And send up a bottle of champagne, fifty-two, waiter! If you had known how I was laughing at you! Are you listening to me, Johnny Mellors? Laughing! SLURRED You tramp! You lousy tramp! Oh, tramp maybe. But a hell of a lot smarter than you. Fill it up, please. - Right, madam. Oh no! Ah non! C'est pas vrai! Ah non! C'est pas possible! C'est pas possible! C'est pas possible! Non! Non!
