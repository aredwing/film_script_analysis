I know it's hard, Mister, but maybe repeating 8th grade is exactly what you need. When you were offered after school help, you refused it. That's... That's fine. That was your right. We can't force it on you, but now you have to accept the consequences of that choice. I can't pass you. But I am willing to do what I can to help you. It's plain to see that you need it. Fuck you. Get the hell out of my car! Yo, what about my son, man? What about your son? It's just me and him. Let me go. You can't lock me up. I'm all he's got. Man, don't worry about your son. If you cooperate, then maybe your ass will see him later. they're gonna take care of him over at Riverview. Riverview? Hell, no! Hey! Daddy, don't let them take me! Don't let them take me there! TJ, relax. Take care. Look, man, you trying to take my son and put him in the system? Go ahead. Watch your feet. Get in! Was he beating up on you? Did he hit you? Yeah, he hit me. He hit you? Okay, that... I mean, that's domestic violence. Listen, I need to talk to you about the acting auditions on August 7th. Remember I told you about the TV show in Beverly Hills? The auditions are downtown, and how you're gonna take me to the auditions and you would... Yeah, I know, Mister. Why is Pete in my room on my PlayStation? Yo! Go get something for dinner. You don't you have any real money? This is real money, Mister. Straight up, I'm not babysitting, dude. Mister, take Pete with you. What you looking at, chopstick? What'd you say to him? I didn't say anything. He stole. What? He stole. Shut up. And who told you to play with my PlayStation, anyway? Don't ever touch my stuff. Denied. Insufficient funds. What? The card is out of money. I will need another form of payment. Fuck that. Excuse me? Again, please. Nothing. Just give me back the card. You know what? I think I'll give it to its rightful owner. But it's my mom's, yo. First of all, I am not your "Yo". Second, tell your mom to come and get it if she wants it. But not you. You are banned. Banned? Banned for what? Just leave before I call the police. But I didn't do... Leave! Why are you banned? Why are you banned, Mister? That's him. The one who stole. Yo, you don't snitch, all right? But stealing's wrong. Look, people do what they have to do to survive out here. It's candy. What are you talking about? It's candy. I heard you, man. Annoying as hell. Damn! Stay here. The card is out of money. What? The welfare card. Dude at the store said you have to come and get it. Where's Peter? I don't know. Somewhere. I'm right here, Mister. Why's he here anyway? If I'm babysitting, his mom's is gonna pay me for real. She give you money to pay me? We're going out to eat. What? Go clean up. We're going to eat. We don't have money to go out to eat! Hey! Don't talk to me like that. How are you, Peter? Good. Thanks. How was school today, Mister? Same as always. It was the last day, right? Guess you're a freshman now. You know Curtis from our building? What about him? He got nabbed today. He did? What for? What do you think? They took his son to Riverview. Dude's like my age. I always heard Curtis was into some bad stuff. He should have known his ass would end up in jail. He works for the same drug-dealing pimp you work for. Eat your cheeseburger, Mister. And what about his son? He's stuck at the worst group home in the world. He deserves that because his pop's a screw-up? Jesus, would you eat your goddamn food and shut up? I'll be back in a minute. Yeah. Yeah. Why're you here? Eat the rest. That's okay. I'm... I'm full. Eat the rest. Now! Let's go. No. Pete's not done. He's not wasting that food. He can take it with him, Mister. He's not taking it with him. He's eating it now! Finish it! What the hell is wrong with you? What the hell is wrong with you? Sucking dick in the bathroom! Keep the change. Think big. Think positive. Always go for the throat. Buy low, sell high. Fear? That's the other guy's problem. Nothing you have ever experienced will prepare you for the absolute carnage you are about to witness. Super Bowl, World Series, they don't know what pressure is. In this building, it's either kill or be killed. You make no friends in the pits and you take no prisoners. One minute you're up half a million in soybeans and the next, boom, your kids don't go to college and they've repossessed your Bentley. Are you with me? Yeah, we got to kill the motherf... We got to kill 'em! They want you to buy as much OJ as you can, the instant trading stock. Stay here. I'll be back. Is it all right if I have some water maybe? Man, I don't care. Hey, do me a favor. What? Run in there and get me a paper. For what? To read, why else? Where that Chinese nigga at? He's not Chinese. Where he at? Why? Because I don't like him, that's why. Something fishy about that nigga. Man, whatever, yo. Why you can't just go in there and get it yourself? Man, what's with all the questions, man? You gonna help me out or not? I ain't gonna be your paperboy and shit. How's that supposed to look? Man, whatever, Dip Stick. What? What you call me? Punk motherfucker! Hey, what do you think you're doing? Oh, okay. We'll see! We'll see! We're out of cereal and milk and everything. Take the card and go to the store. I told you. Dude at the store took it. You have to go get it. I circled the ones you can do. They probably don't care about background checks. This is what you think of me? I wasn't about to circle rocket scientist if that's what you mean. Mister, what's your problem? My problem? You are gonna stop talking to me like I'm your goddamn child. I'm your mother. You think I'm satisfied with this life? I'm not. I'm just trying to get things in order. You been saying that for how long now? I'm sick of hearing it. You know what I'm sick of? I'm sick of you. You and your smartass mouth. You keep on talking shit, I'm gonna kick your nappy-head ass out for good. What's the difference? I'll be better off. That's the shit I'm talking about. You just know everything, don't you? Don't you? I do what I do 'cause ain't nobody gonna help me. They never have. They never will. Mister, take Pete and go. You're disgusting. I wish you would just die already. At least we have that in common. Take Pete and go. That's B-Ball. B-Ball? Like basketball? No, like Bernard Ball. That's his name. Stay right here, right next to him. Why? So no one messes with you. Can't I come with you, Mister? Hell, no! Why is he staring at you like that? He always does that. In like 10 minutes, head back up. She probably won't even know you're there. Grab some jelly from the fridge, grab some bread, make a sandwich. Alice. Come for a ride with me, Mister. What's up, Alice? Let's go for a ride. I got my board. I see. You got something better going on or what? All right. I can kick it with you for a minute. He with you? Who? You sure you don't wanna check on her? Nah, she's all right. She's probably asleep. She works nights, so... I saw you when I was getting ready for my run. You see me? When I was skating? I thought maybe that was you. I see you out there every Saturday, Mister. You wanna know who that man I was with is? Bitch, you think I'm giving you shit for free? Say I'll work for it one more time and I'll fuck your shit up! You know her? Yeah, that's... That's... Nah. I don't know her. Go ahead, Pete. Why do you frown so much? Doesn't it make your face hurt? Anyways... Anyways. I miss you, knucklehead. I miss hanging out in our building. You were always so sweet to me. Just tell me you miss me too. I guess. I don't know. I really haven't seen you since you dropped out and moved out of our building. You got a maid now. So... Look in that duffel bag over there. It's yours if you want it. Where'd you get all this? You got to go. Take the bag. I might not be able to take this stuff on the plane to Beverly Hills. Maybe you can sell it. Tell your mom thank you for the donuts and milk, please. I live by myself, Pete. Your parents let you live by yourself? Come on. Oh, have fun at Riverview. Word got out. Curtis sung like a jay bird. Anybody and everybody that works for Kris, boom, they're out of here. Everybody know your mom ho for that cat. She going to jail. Where you think you're going, huh? It's inevitable. Inevitable, baby! Hey! What is it now? Come on, Pete! Go, go. Shh! Open up! Who is it? Open up! Hold on, hold on, hold on. Hold on, I'm coming. Hurry up! We have a warrant to search the premises. I'm gonna need you to sit down. Yeah, I got the living room. Let me check. Hands on your lap, please. Oh! Oh, yeah. We got something. Hey, Sarge. Found this in the living room. Syringe, spoon, lighter's still warm. Check the bedroom. All right. Shit. Anybody in here? Aye, Sarge. Uh, I checked the other bedroom. It's empty. Seems to be clear in here as well. I bet you we just missed him. The mother's pretty messed up. Leave him this. He'll be wondering where his momma is. Take her down. Let's go. And when you see the kid, make sure you grab him. Bring the bag. All right. I got it. You should change. Can I have some privacy, please? It's going to be a heat advisory from noon until 8:00 p. m. on Thursday. So here's some quick tips for you. Wear light colored clothing. It will reflect the sun rays... Today in New York, we're already in the 80's, and we're going for once again 100 degrees. This pirate game was your idea, Timmy. Besides, it's my favorite color. Argh! Okay. I'll give it a shot. Not so fast, Greenbeard! En garde! It's time for you to go home. I could just stay with you. She's not home. Hi, Peter. Is there something I can help you with? How do you know Pete? I used to babysit for him once in a while. Right, Peter? Well can you watch him until his mom gets here? I'd be happy to. Come on, Peter. Come on. Yeah? He's filthy. He needs a bath. Let's go, Pete. Oh, I'm gonna call the police. She ever do stuff to you before? She makes me sit in the bathtub with my clothes off. She ever touch you? Why didn't you tell me anything? You said don't snitch. Come on. So, I can stay with you? Moms will be out in a few days. I'll just pawn some stuff from around the house so we can eat till she gets back. Promise? Yeah. Let's go. I'm just getting some stuff. No. I need some privacy. There's a turkey in the freezer. What? You promised. See, right there, just like that. You got to be prepared to run. Know what I mean? Why? You wanna end up in Riverview? That's why. "Niggas for life. " What did you say? You my nigga, Pete? I'm Korean. You can still be my nigga. Do I have to be? Stay here. The turkey! Shit. Are we going to ask for help, Mister? We can't tell anybody we're on our own. Don't tell anybody. Matter of fact, you don't talk at all. Housing Authority catches us out here, that's a wrap. So we got to lay it low. Because we might end up in Riverview, right? Is it true that two kids were killed there once? More than two, Pete. Way more. Wait here. Hey, hey. Told you not to come in here. What are you doing here? I told you you're banned. Hey, don't touch that. You put that down. Hey! Get out of my store! Hey, nigger. Hey! Hey! You little punk! Look, I'm gonna pay him back as soon as I get some money. Really? Really. Soon as Mom gets home, she can take care of it. Things will be better when she comes home. She can take me to my audition. What audition? For a TV show I'm going to be on. I really don't want to get into it. But it shoots in Beverly Hills. Maybe I can come, too. No. When Mommy comes back, she can take care of your situation. We just need to make it another day or two. Mister! Mister! That's my mom's friend. He's not her friend, trust me. You know him? Everybody knows him. That's Kris. My mom works for him, your mom works for him. That's how they know each other. He's cool. He's been to my house before. Maybe he can help us. Yeah, help us get high or... What? We don't need his help. We gonna put their face down. Better write that in stone. Let's go. Thank you. What's up, Henry? What's up, what? I'm here to work this corner. Too bad. "Too bad?" What do you mean "Too bad"? I'm here to work it. Tough cookie, Mister. Tough cookie? Yeah. Tough cookie. Now move on. I don't have time for your crap today. Crap? What crap? You know what? Stop doing that. Stop repeating everything I say. I hear what you're trying to do. Man, what's your problem, yo? And push your lips back into your face! You think you can intimidate people into giving you a handout? Nobody owe you nothing! Man, whatever, yo. Yeah, whatever. Move on. I'm working this spot. You can go find yourself your own corner. What war? What war, Henry? What's it to you? You're a veteran. What war, Henry? You better get the hell out of here. That's what I thought. You're the real scumbag, Henry. Come on, Pete. Real respectful, Mister. You're a real winner. Eat a dick, tough cookie. What? $17. Mister, how long has your mom been gone? I don't know. Usually they keep her for a day or two, never more than two weeks. It's been longer than that. Hey, look down and keep walking. Motherfuck. Crap. Yes. I'm calling to check on the status of Gloria Winfield. She was booked, about three weeks ago. I'm her brother. Okay. She was let go a week ago. That's good. So where is she? Yo, when was the last time you took a shower? I took a shower. But there was no soap. You smell vicious. There's no toilet paper either. Privacy, please. "An actor must know how to live truthfully under imaginary circumstances. "You don't pretend to be the character. You are the character. "You must learn how to use the reality in front of you. "They say we belong to the life we're living and the world of the story. "You don't pretend to be the character. You are the character. "Who am I? "Where am I? "What am I doing here?" Come on, hurry up. Let's go, let's go! Ready? Yo, what's taking so long? This one is different than ours. And I only did that because my mom took my key. And I never did it wearing pantyhose before. Can you do it or not? Hey, Pete. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mister. I don't want to do this anymore. Put the food back. Nobody needs to know that we were here. I got another idea. Hey... It's over. Everybody's all right. Okay? No. No, keep those. You got the power. We got the power. We all got the power. You got the power. We got the power. We all got the power. You got the power.

You know what the difference is between you and me? I make this look good. You wanna hear my monologue? What's that? It's like this long speech. You use it to show you can act. I picked mine from Fargo. You ever see that? Hmm, nah. I don't think so. It's hilarious. About these Minnesota people with funny accents. I guess you think, you're a, you know, like an authority figure. With that stupid fuckin' uniform. Huh, buddy? King clip-on tie here. Big fuckin' man, huh? You know these are the limits of your life, man. Ruler of your little fuckin' gate here. Here! Here's your $4, you pathetic piece of shit. That's very good, Mister. I'm going to get us a real house, Mister. I'm gonna get a job, and I'm gonna stop doing drugs. And I'm gonna stop selling myself for money. I'm just trying to get things in order. You won't have to be ashamed to be my son no more. Now run. Run, Mister. I need time alone. That's tight, right? See? Yeah. Mister? Is it okay not to love your mom? I mean, you can't help but love her, Pete. But you don't have to like her. Ready? Ready. Go, Sarah! Go, Sarah! Come on, Sarah. Come on, Sarah. Turn around. Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Come on, turn around. You can do this. Let's go, baby. Let's go. Go. Go. Keep rolling! Keep rolling. Come on, Sarah. Keep rolling! Come on, baby. Go Sarah. Sarah, keep moving!

Can I help you? No, we got it. Let me see what you've got there. We're good, man. Let me see the card, please. I know it don't make sense. Two kids shopping for groceries in the middle of the night. But where we're from, you don't want people seeing what you bring into your home. They'll rob you blind for a carton of milk if they have to. So, we shop while they sleep. Plus my mom, she works two jobs and she doesn't have time. And tomorrow is her birthday. I wanted to get groceries and have a big breakfast for when she comes home. I just wanted to do one thing so she'd have one less thing to worry about. Tell your mom happy birthday. Thanks. And the Oscar goes to... All right. You can come if you want. Come where? Beverly Hills. I do want to. In like a month I should have the part. August 7th. August 7th. What are you doing? Didn't I tell you stop playing games with me? They're for you. What'd you do to them? If you don't want 'em I'll take 'em back. God bless you, Mister. Come on, man! Come on! Yo, come on! Come on! Something's wrong. What are you going to do? Stay here. Where are you going? I got to save the food. Hey! Get out of my store. I just need some ice and a big cooler. That's all. Get out! Yo, please don't be the asshole right now, all right? I am not the asshole. You're the asshole. I can pay you. I just need some ice. Come on, man. Look, if you don't get out of my store right now, I swear to God... Don't even think about it. You had to be the asshole. Hold on one second. Yo, Housing Authority know you out here? Shut the hell up, Dip Stick. What'd you call me? Dip Stick? What the hell that mean? Leave me alone. Why you call me Dip Stick? What you looking at? You broke into my apartment? Yeah. Yeah, I did that. It's not like you had anything worth shit. I stole all your stuff and all I have is these Kicks to show for it. You dirty ass. You need to get out of my face. What are you gonna do? You gonna do something? You gonna do something? You gonna do something, huh? You little mother... Come here! Don't you ever call me Dip Stick again! You hear me? You hear me talking to you? You hear me talking to you? Stop! Stop it! Shut up! Come here! Yeah, I'm good, right? Hey! Stop! You hear me talking to you? Hey! Hey, get off! Get off of him! I'm gonna see you again, Mister. I'm gonna see you again. What was that about? Let me help you. Let me help you. Get off me! You think I'm a charity case! What? No I just... I just wanna talk to you. Yeah, you do! You do! You know, maybe it isn't all about you, Mister. Alice! Hold on. Wait! Wait... We're looking at one or two thunderstorms developing as the day goes on. Temperatures by then in the mid-nineties. So it looks like August is going to start just as hot as July ended. Unfortunately the summer heat wave continues and shows no signs of letting up. Mister, open the door. I'm sorry. No, no, no. Don't open that. You wanna help me clean it up, Pete? Okay. But can I finish my food first, please? I want to bring you some stuff. I'll even let you pay me back. Why? Why? Why what? Why do you keep trying to help me? You are my friend, got it? So don't ever make me feel bad for wanting to help you again. You're gonna miss me when I'm in Beverly Hills. I know you're not moving, Mister. I am. Me and Pete. August 7th. So you'll be here in a couple hours, then? You can come, too. As fun as that sounds, I can't come with you. Why? What is it? He wants me to move in with him. You're not doing that, are you? He already left his wife and kids. He's married? Hell, no, Alice. I know... I'm going to tell him no. I'm leaving him. He left his family for you. I never asked. It's my life, not his. I want to find my own way. Want me to come with you? Thanks, Mister, but I got it. When is your mom coming home? They let her out of jail over a month ago. If she was coming back, she probably would have by now. Mister, how did you... What are you going to do? I told you. I'm going to Beverly Hills. I'll be back in an hour or two. I'll be back. Muah! Muah! Muah! Muah! What are you laughing at? Is she coming? She'll be back. Is she coming today? I don't know. Probably not. You think it's because you kissed her? Why do you ask so many questions? I mean, you talk more than anybody else in the world. You talk more than me. Nobody talks more than you. You do. "Yo this" and "Yo that". I don't say "Yo" a lot. I don't feel very well. Do we have any food left? Hey, lock the door behind me. I'll be back in a minute. But we can't go outside. Henry! Hello, Mister. Have you seen my mom? She works this corner sometimes. Hey, Mister, I'm doing okay today. You can have the spot for rush hour if you want it. No, thanks. I need to find her. Hey, Mister, Mister, Mister... Hold up. Third Battalion, fifth Marine. Gulf War. Operation Desert Shield. Good luck to you, Mister. Hey! Hey, man! What's up, little man? You seen my mom? She works for you. She work for me? She don't work for me, but go ahead. Come on, man. You think I'm wired or something? I'm not about snitching. What's her name? Gloria. Gloria? What, with all the tattoos? I was wondering where she been myself. What are you, her son? You haven't seen her? Nah. But when you find her, tell her to come see me, all right? Yo, you don't even care enough to look for her? She worked for you for like four years. What the fuck you just say to me? That's some bullshit, Kris. Little Mighty Mouse, motherfucker. That was you with Dip Stick? And all he gave you was a dollar? Gimme that! Move! Pete! Pete, let me in! Sarah passed... Unit Two, theft reported. Bedford playground. Please respond. Shots fired. Officer needs assistance. Unit Two. Please respond. Ten-four. Copy. I'm three minutes away. It's okay now, Pete. Sarah passed away. What's it say? 102, I think. Is that bad? How do you feel now? Better, Mister. What day is it? Forget it, Pete. Forget it? You need a doctor. Let's go. Violet Carson? Oh, yeah, here. What's your name? Mister Winfield. Ah! What's your first name? Mister is my first name. Uh, who's your agent? Do you have a parent here with you? No. I have this. We can't see you unless you have an agent or at least parental consent. But I'm really good. What's that? I said I'm good. There's nothing we can do. I guess you think, you know, you're like an authority figure. With that stupid fucking uniform, huh, buddy? King clip-on tie here. Big fucking man, huh? You know, these are the limits of your life, man. Ruler of your little fuckin' gate here. Here. There's your $4, you pathetic piece of shit. I'm sorry. I'm going to lie down, but I'm okay. I'll be back in an hour. Wait. I'll come, too. No, you gotta stay here. What are you going to do? Ask for help. It's fine, I'll just take the subway. I have my phone with me, you don't have to worry. Oh, great! Hi. Um, who are you looking for? A friend. Apartment 5. Alice? You know where she is? She moved out. Run, Pete. Where do you think you're going? Run. He's going in the other direction. I'm not going to tell you one more time. Look stop, boy. Goddamn! Oh, man! Come here. Come on, get him to the car. Yo, Officer! There go one more right here. We'll get him later, man. Thanks for the tip. Keep it up. All right, man. What up, Kris? You tell me. Yo, you know they been living by themselves all summer. Oh, word? Yeah, man. They the reason Housing Authority's around here so much. Not you, huh? No! Oh! Yo, they were supposed to be at Riverview a long time ago. When I put the po-po on to Curtis. Fuck. Okay. What I mean is... Yes? The police, they was accusing me of breaking into apartments. Right. And... What you saying? They said they would drop it if I gave them something. I just told them Curtis was selling, that's it. So you gave them Curtis. That's it, man. Nothing about you. Just Curtis... Right. Because you wouldn't snitch on me, right? Ah, hell, no! I wouldn't snitch on you. Hell, no, man. 'Cause you're my man. Hell, yeah! When niggas be talking about you bad, I be the one that's defending you. Word up. What's your name, man? Dartavius Stallsworth. Okay, Mr. Stallsworth. See those two ugly, sweaty dudes over there? I want you to become friends with them. Okay? We all gonna take a ride together. Let's take a ride. Get him. You got clout, right? What? You got a job for me? A job for you? What you talking about, man? You strung out? Yeah, he looks strung out. I don't mess with that stuff, man. I just need a job. You ever find your mom? She's dead. Look, everybody gotta die, little man. Just give me a job. I'll do whatever you want. You don't have to pay me. What, are you gonna work for free? I just want my friend out of Riverview. You can make that happen, right? Everybody says you're the shit. You get things done. I'll work for you, Kris. Just get my friend out. Look... Take this, all right? You don't work for free. I just want my friend back. I'll teach you a lesson! Kris! Kris! You need a lesson. Come on. Let's go, man. This ain't our fight. Let's roll. Think you can steal from me? Think you can wreck my store? You! Drop the kid. Put down the goddamn kid! Son of a bitch! That little rat stole from me! He wrecked my store. Get the fuck out of here. Cuff him. Apartment 3E? We took your momma away a couple of months ago. She around? Get up. All summer, huh? Keep your head up, son. What are you? 13? 14 years old? Keep fighting. There ain't no ceiling for a kid like you. I can't do it alone. What's that? I can't do it alone. None of us can. Wait right there. Uh, this is Mister Winfield. Come on. There's things to do. Games. Come on. Yo, what's your problem? Come on, honey. Come on. Mister. Not while we're here. Understand? So what's up? Nothing. I'm not sick anymore and the food here is pretty good. Who did that to your eye? I don't know their names. Show them to me. Mister is being released to you with the understanding that you will continue your rehab. How was he? Not too bad. A couple of incidents, but he was protecting a friend. He barely had time to settle in. He's been here all summer and didn't settle in? No. No? He's only been with us two weeks. Where was he before that? I don't know. All I know is Housing Authority picked him up from home. When I was arrested they told me that he would be brought here. I thought he was safe. I thought he was... I thought he was here. Our records show that you were released over two months ago. If you were so concerned about Mister, even if you believed he was here, I was making sure the next time I saw him, I could look him in the eye. Can you? Hey! Is that your mom? Yeah. I'll be back for you. Promise? I promise. You're strong, Pete. Don't let anybody punk you. Got it? I got it. I'll see you soon. Hi, Mister. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. We are going to jump right into it. I want you all to write about what you did this summer, okay? I want you to be as detailed as you possibly can. Make it at least one page long, okay? And I want you to take the whole period to do it. If you took a trip this summer, I wanna know about it. I wanna know where you went, who you went with. Anything you remember. Think about the last three months. As much as you can. What did you do, say, on the 4th of July? Okay, did anybody in your family have a birthday? Are there any good books that you read this summer?
