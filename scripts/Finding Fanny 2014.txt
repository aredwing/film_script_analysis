Let's bring this reckless act to an end. Smoking is banned in all public places. And it is apply. Don't smoke. No let anyone do. Smoking will cost you. Your one seeks happiness. But isn't has a very high price to pay. Smoking can cost you your health. And can also seriously affect the health and welfare of those who endure. Don't have them pay the price for your smoking. Smoking will cost you. Ferdie has a candle for every ailment. He's the postmaster of the village... but no one here writes or posts letters. The man with the golden voice. The only choir boy who refused to stop singing in church... even after he wasn't a boy anymore. Floating in a life inside his own head, my best friend Ferdie... who'll never have a story to tell... unless the story comes looking for him This is my home. This is my village of Pocolim. Hidden somewhere in Goa. Don't try looking for it. You won't find it. Time passes in a strange way here. It stops when you stop... and runs when you run. Isn't that interesting? I wonder what I wish for everyday... Maybe, wishing is a bad habit. Like picking your nose and wiping it under the table... or eating too much spicy Sorpotel in summer. Yet, not a day passes without a wish. This is Rosalina, my mother-in-law. You know some peoples are just want to take charge to everything. Imagine a puppet-show, as large as a village. If Mai ever threw away the strings... life in Pocoli would just crumble to a halt. Happy feast. Call me Mrs. Eucharistica. Mrs. Eucharis... - Forget it. So you're Maria's... The one Maria's sis-in-law spoke about. You call this a bio-data. Why oh why? Why means what, aunty. - What? What? You just said 'Why means what'. No, I mean you said... I said... That's the problem with you youngsters. You just can't speak properly. How why means what? Idiot. Come on. Now say fast, what you want. Aunty Maria said you'll fix me up with a nice girl. Fair complexion and full of life. Does your aunty think I'm a magician? I'll go to the gym. So what are you waiting for? Christmas? Whether it's a leaf on a tree or a dog on the street... no one can move an inch, without Mai's permission. If you mess with Mai, it's best to leave town. Except, in Pocolim nobody leaves. Angie. Yes, Mai. Did Nereus drink his milk properly? Can't you land on your feet? Mai. Have you noticed Nereus keeps falling asleep... at the strangest of times? What's so strange about it? He sleeps when he feels sleepy. You know it's called Narcolepsy. Where you keep falling asleep. You leave Nereus alone. He knows better than you how to behave like a cat. Next you'll be telling me how much I should sleep? Rosie and I have just one thing in common. Loneliness. I don't know when Rosie's husband died. She never speaks of it. And I never ask. As for me, I was married to Rosie's son Gabo. Very handsome. Every girl wanted to marry him. That's what he thought. I don't know if I was in love with him... but he was already very much in love with himself. And anyway... no one ever said no to Gabo. Our wedding was the talk of the town. From food and drinks, all the arrangements... were simply the best. Rosie did everything. Gabo was so happy that day... that he couldn't imagine life getting any better. And for him, it didn't. But life was looking up for Rosie. She now had an admirer. A famous artist had moved to Pocolim. A magician with the paintbrush. Every stroke of which... earned him a standing ovation from the art world. They say that Don Pedro Cleto Colaco has just one inspiration. Women. Big women. I told you I'll set you up! What are you doing here? She's right here. Why can't it be now? She's busy. You have to wait if you want it done properly! Wait for what? The Second Coming? You've been waiting for 2000 years. Any luck? I can't talk right now. Please leave. Rumour has it, he's only looking for only one thing... his last inspiration. And this... is Savio. We were friends until I broke his heart. He just came back home... after 6 years. To no family. Probably searching for some imagined family treasure... in this empty house, all alone. He's a broken man. And I did the breaking. Savio, Gabo and I grew up together. Those two were inseparable... but also fiercely competitive. So when I told Savio that I am marrying Gabo... without saying a word, he left Pocolim. He returned after making his fortune in Mumbai... for his father's memorial service. There was no point in coming earlier. Rosalina had taken care of everything. Jesus Christ, what the... Who is this? You didn't recognize him? It's your father. But this was a black-and-white photograph. It was fully gone. You couldn't even take a good picture of him. That's my fault too? But why didn't you use the original? Look at him. Are you talking about him? Because he's dead. Savio... Savio, another word from you and... Hold on. So this was also my father's idea? What did he say? Paint my face pink. Make me a clown. This... this was Eddie's idea. Who the hell is Eddie, Father? ls he blind? ls he retarded? Look, Savio... it's just a little digital retouching. BY Whom? A monkey? ls Eddie a chimpanzee? ls he a monkey? No. Ferdie. Ferdie. Ferdie. I'm in the back side. I think Savio Da Gama is back. Return of the missing son. Remember Savio? What's this for? This I'll light for my broken heart Angie. Hey, what happened? Ferdie! I knew it was you last night. Continue like this, and... everyone's going to think that you're possessed. Are you? This is Assumption. How can you even say that? It's a mutton bill, Ferdie. Stefanie Fernandes. Fanny. But why didn't you post this letter? I did. It came back, last night. After 46 years. But you're in-charge of the post... so who gave it to you? Ferdie, you proposed to her. - Then what? I asked her hand in marriage. But she never replied because... this letter was never delivered to her. You're damn angry... 46 years! For 46 years I thought she had rejected me. What life is this? Full lie I've lived. Full lie I've lived, for something that never even happened. It's okay. - It's not okay. Stefanie Fernandes was and will always be... the love of my life... and she never even knew. So why didn't you tell her? I thought she'd say know. But, if you don't ask... how will you know what her answer would be? After waiting so long... I wish I had kept waiting. You've been crying? None of your business. This is Pocolim, Ferdie. Out here, everyone's business is everyone e | se's business. Does it work? None of your business. It's funny. How you can cry underwater? Angie. Angie. You're crying? - Yes, Mai. But I think there's a robber outside. What are you doing? Looking for the robber, Mai. Are you mad or what? You're making so much noise. You'll scare him away. Angie. Go away. - Who are you talking to? Go away. The dogs. These dogs. - They gone. Come in. They're gone. I'll take care of their barking. Mai... They always trouble my Nereus. Go and sleep. - Lock the door properly. Ferdie. Ferdie. What happened? - ls she gone? Yeah. I had a dream. What dream? About Fanny. Really? And? She was taking me to a church... and she was saying something to me. And? Then I drowned me in the dream. And then? - Then what? What happened to Fanny? Oh she... She was doing some... Listen Ferdie, we have to find Fanny. No, no, no, I drowned. I'm telling you I drowned. Look at me Ferdinand. Look at me. Do you want to die without telling Fanny... that all your life, you've loved only her? No. - Then? I don't want to die. No, Ferdie. No love story should be left incomplete like this. Savio Da Gama. He?'- It's been 6 years, huh? Looking good. What's this? My side-door neighbour brought us some Tang, from Dubai. Side-door. Six years Savvy, nobody knows anything about you. Whether you're alive, or dead... or married? You know Gabo died that day. Your train must have been leaving from Goa at that time. You didn't even attend his funeral. Not even... What was I supposed to come back and do Angie? Bring him back to life? No letter, not even a phone call... For what? My friend died. Felt like Shit. By the time I found out... he was already gone. So... did you get married? Looking good. The car, looks nice. Are you really selling it? Do you want to buy it? - No. It's for someone called 'SAL'. So... still pressing Rosie's feet? Please, Savio, at least I'm happy. Like always. So what's your problem? You know there's a world outside Pocolim, right? Life isn't easy here, but we make the most of it, okay? Really? What do I know about problems? Anyway- I feel like I'm asking a stranger for a favour. What favour? I need the car. This is no longer my car. - Then whose is it? That artist. That Pedro? How did this happen? Lots of money coming your way. Can't complain. Stop pretending. I've heard about your big business in Mumbai. Well, yeah! Anyway, what do you need the car for? That stingy bugger won't lend it to anyone. You know that postmaster Ferdie? He and I are going on a short trip. Running away with the postmaster? Yes... if the artist lends me the car will you drive? He won't give it unless you bribe him. Rosie. Rosie. Mrs. Eucharistica, Mr. Colaco. Of course. I want to make a painting of you... for all the social work that you do. It will be shown in places like Milan, New York, London. I think it's a wonderful idea, Mai. No, no... I mean... But, come on you have to. Yes but... - You go to the church every day. Up and down. Up and down. So much work you do. You can at least do this much for yourself. - It's God's work. Can you see it, Madame Eucharistica? - What? Can you see yourself in the painting, Madame? Oh Rosie, it's my... I mean, your future. Can you see it please, now? No. Not really. I mean, sometimes I get a little carried away, you see. Don't worry. Sometimes, Mai's also in a different mood. That's okay. But... - Nothing. What you offered her was nice only. - Yes, of course. You must be busy these days with your foreign trips? Busy? I don't have the time to breathe, darling. Oh... Because we were planning a road trip. Who we? - Mai and me. I thought you'll get a chance, you know... to know her better. But it's okay. Next time. Time is what I don't have. It's alright. - No, no, no, no. I'll adjust. Everything happened so fast that... I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to tell you earlier. Anyway... I'll leave from Chapel Point at 11 in the morning... for a matter of Christian charity. I'm going to help Ferdie. He needs my help more than anyone else in the world. Don Pedro has offered his car for this journey and... of course, he's coming along. Sweet of him, isn't it? He couldn't stop going on about how he wishes paint you. All he keeps talking about is... capturing your elegance and beauty on canvas. So flattering, isn't it? It started. It started. It started. I'll just have to be careful of our driver, Savio. The way he looks at me makes me uncomfortable. But how will I stop him? By looking at your photo. I will stop myself from getting drawn into temptation... You've always taught me to put other's needs before ours. And now is the time to put this into practice... so the world will say that Rosalina... has taught her daughter-in-law well! What are you doing here? There's a lady coming on this trip. You could've cleaned the car... before bringing it here? I hope the seats are clean. Leather and sweat smell like pigs' piss after a while. This is rexine, you idiot. You... What did you say? I said it's clean. You... She's here. The beautiful Angelina. The glow on your cheeks puts the sun to shame. And the Romeo of Romeos. The Casanova of the Konkan. You're an inspiration to lovers. I salute you, sire. And where's the other lovely lady? She'll be coming, soon. I'll be right back. I'm here only. Why are you holding my hand? Listen, before you get furious... let me tell you, this was out of my control, okay. Lies. What did you expect me to say to him? Don't come. You tricked me into driving this car. What do you mean I tricked you? This is his car, after all. Listen, I just wanted to get out this village. Finally, I wanted to spend some time... - I'm sorry. I had to help Ferdie. So you lied. You know what, to hell with him. And don't talk to me, just go. You know, Savio... sometimes, you need to make an effort to find love. Angie, this is why... She's also coming along?! Rosalina, the first lady of Pocolim. What a lovely day this is... that comes with the privilege of your company. My humble car awaits. Come. - Here. Why do you drop everything? Are you butter fingers? It moved. Of course it moved, it's a cat. Don... Madame. What a lovely cat. Just making a bit of noise. Has it come to say goodbye to us? Will Nereus come along, Mai? We need to discuss some imponant things, young lady. Look here. Come. How will I face my Gabo... if I can't even protect his wife's purity? Proud of you. - Thank you, Mai. And there's no one to look after Nereus. He'll be fine. He'll stay with me. You take care of him. You okay? What a lovely car, Don Pedro. Yes, I thought so too when I saw it for the first time. Just needed a bit of repair. Nothing much though. Hey you, can you drive a fine imported car like this? Hey, it's you I'm talking to. And good morning. Your mother must have forgotten to teach you manners. It's okay, I'll teach you. You're asking me if I can drive? I mean... are you qualified? It's a foreign car after all. What? The gears are different. Can anyone here drive this car? Since you know a lot about foreign cars and their bloody gears? I can't... And since this is Don Pedro's car... and he doesn't know how to drive, so who's left? Huh, madam? I don't trust this hooligan's driving. Everything should be alright. God mess. Okay Ferdinand... Thank you. Ferdie, we really don't need to make this small talk. Sorry. There's something strange on your face. No... I mean. Why are you speaking now? Hey Ferdie, open the bottle. He couldn't even get water? Couldn't even do this much? I keep doing work for others all the time... but no one cares. I'm thirsty, one second. Yuck! What is this? What are you doing? What? What am I doing? What am I doing? Yes, what are you doing? How much longer will I have to wait, god dammit? What are you saying? So tell me, Ferdie, how come no Mrs. Ferdie all these years? Oh... Just like that. There was no one else... after Fanny. She is for real, right? Romeo without a Juliet. Sorry. I want to put this cat inside. Wipe your face. He looks alive, doesn't he? What? Does anyone want to tell Mai what just happened? Exactly. So we'll stop somewhere on the way and say a prayer for Nereus. You mean, she'll wake up and see... that Nereus passed away in his sleep? Yeah. See... see. Fanny's house. Happy? Come. This house is bigger than your palace. Pretty, no? Pretty, like my Fanny. This is it, sir. It's your show from now. Come on, you Romeo. No more thinking. Make or break. Ferdie. Hey... Go get him. Get him. Ferdie. Ferdie. Ferdie, wait up. Ferdie. Ferdie, wait. Wait. What if... What if she doesn't recognize me? Mad or what? Who would forget a personality like yours? Yes, I haven't changed much. I'm the same. - Yes. So there's nothing to worry about. Yeah. Show her your romantic side. There are thorns everywhere. Show. Show. Ferdie. Hold this. Stupid. You shou | d've got some other flowers. Why did you pluck roses? - Savio said. I look alright? Excuse me, sir. We're looking for Stefanie Fernandes. Of course, you are. She's waiting for you. You must come in, please. Come, come. Welcome to my home! She married a foreigner? - No. He's a bloody hippie. Russian. I'll handle it. What is he talking? What do you want my friend? An umbrella would be nice, but we're looking for... What's her name? - Stefanie Fernandes. This is her husband, he wants to tell her that. Not like that. This morning, Stefanie Fernandes... runs away with my umbrella. With your umbrella? This morning? You must all sit. I come back. Any pictures of Fanny? I can't really tell. My name is Vladimir llyanova. But you can call me Vladimir llyanova. Both. Hey you? Why you have brought yellow flowers to my house. Don't you know it's bad luck? They are for Fanny. What is funny? Fanny. - This is not funny. Stefanie Fernandes, remember? Sir, Stefanie Fernandes your wife? My wife... My wife is in Russia, long dead. And my mother... Can I offer... Why are you doing this to me? Please take them outside. Excuse me. This man has come looking for Stefanie Fernandes. You know her, right? Vladimir? Vladamir. My mother named me Vladimir. - Sir. You bought this house from Stefanie Fernandes? 20 more years ago. Wonderful lady. She moved to Tivoli... that is few hours on the other side from here. The government made a lot of problems. "about selling to a foreigner. But... I had married an Indian. So... I got lucky. Lovely lady Stefanie Fernandes. Just star-t the car when I tell you. Savio. - Yes. Thanks. For what? I love her. I really love her. Hey, Savio. Tell you a secret? Yeah... You know Albert and I were shippies together. Rosa | ina's husband, Albert. I heard. We sailed together that last time... just before he never came back. So you were on the ship when he died. He didn't die. He did not die. - What? Just never came back. Just wrote her a letter saying he's never coming back. Gave me to give her. But... wasn't there a big memorial? Rosalina, the pregnant widow... Husband buried at sea. He found a girl in Madagascar. Jumped ship, disappeared. What I mean is why tell such a big lie? Of course. Pride. Her bloody pride. That's why she hates me, you know. Because I am the only one who knows. Apart from her and Albert. Now you know. That explains her bitterness. Promise you won't tell her. Then why you told me? Be nice to her. Sometimes. Sometimes. When I was small, I used to be an angel... in feasts. Do you want to hear a song? Okay then. Either this car doesn't use petrol... or we need to get some when we get to Tivoli. You want to hear some songs I wrote about Fanny? No Ferdie, I would like to know where that right turn is. It'll come. It'll come on the right. Oh my little pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Pussy. You're such an animal lover, Pedro. Madame. I've never loved an animal as much as this... lively little fellow. Give him to me, must be hungry. No, no, no. I assure you that he's quite stuffed. Come, my little baby. Come, come, come. That's it. On the right. Stop. Stop the car. Stop the car. - Why? Stop the car. Hello, everyone. I just want you to say. I could not have done this without you all. What man, now you're giving a speech or what? My Fanny's village is just up ahead. I hope my hear-t doesn't burst with happiness. When I meet Fanny... I'll talk to her only with my eyes. Might be a blessing. Why don't you do the same for us, you idiot? Talk with your eyes only. Anyway... you all made it possible. Especially you, Angie. My hear-t was like a bird... that could not fly. It would never be able to fly... if it wasn't for you. Thank you, Ferdinand. Fernando. Fernando. Fanny always used to call me Fernando. Not a bad speech. You should have one ready for Fanny if you see her. Everybody ready? Everyone ready? Start the car. Start the car. Everyone ready? Faster. Faster. Faster. Faster. Give me the map. Why? You idiot, we're in bloody Karnataka. Means what? Means we've crossed into another state. What state? A bloody mental state. He's shouting. Mad he's become or what? And you... please explain. When did I say I can read a map! The days in which I had to fall in love. I spent all those days writing letters to you. O Fanny Re... O Fanny Re... All the happiness's of my life. Got killed as I was lost in the thoughts of Your whereabouts. O Fanny Re... O Fanny Re... O my beloved! O Fanny Re... O Fanny Re... N ow what? Now... now what? We've run out of petrol. O Fanny Re... Savvy... Savio. Yeah, what? What are you doing? Getting that bloody idiot out of my system. I didn't sign up for this bullshit. - Oh, sorry. For what? My fault, trusting that fool to read a map. It's like a chimpanzee reading Shakespeare. It's not that bad. - Not that bad? And that painter bullshitter! Madame this. Madame that. What madame?! She's just a fat old cow. They are old people, Savvy... and old people will be old people. You can't change that. - Right. They get away with a lot of shit, old people. Good excuse. If you stay alive long enough.. ...people eventually forget that you were born stupid. What's your problem? You've more than most people do. So why are you complaining all the time? - One second. What do I have? What do I have? 20 dentures. 10 shins, 5 pants, 3 socks and 2 underwear. That's all dear daddy left me. Oh, did I forget to mention? One bloody falling down house. Well, I can't complain. I never had any daddy, dentures or house. Oh, please, spare me your little orphanage sob story. Poor Angie, alone in this world. You let her rule over you. That's your choice. Look, Angie, I'm sorry. I really have nothing against you. And if anything, you're the only one... If it wasn't for you... I would've killed someone by now. Listen... maybe if we plan wisely.. we can do up the house slowly-slowly. Till then I'll come and help you clean the house. What? What? There's no money in Mumbai, Angie. But the business? - What business? I was a bloody waiter for 5 years. Slept on the same tables I served. So you lied. I'll still help you clean the house. For free. Lomos Del Toro. One of the finest brandies known to man, Madame. This is good. You're classy. Classy, Don Pedro. Indeed, Madame. I see that you have a fine palette of a sailor on shore leave. No doubt that you got it from your husband. Husband. May his soul rest in peace. You think he's watching? Let him. I mean why should he alone have fun in heaven? He had lots of fun, nonstop. These sailors, dirty people. No respect for their wives at home. But my Albert wasn't like that. My Albert was very faithful. If I were your husband, madame... I wouldn't go away from you even for a moment. All lies. You men all lies. If you don't go to work, who'll earn? Your father? Of course. How is the brandy, dear lady? Call me Rosie no, nobody else does. Rosie. Now the picture is perfect. I used to miss you in the beginning... until I started enjoying thinking about you. About us. You know I used to make up my own stories. About what could've happened if things had gone differently. If... life hadn't changed... or you hadn't left Goa... Mumbai wasn't easy. Memories were all I had... So it's a deal then? What deal? I want the old Savio back. Same old... Jesus Christ, what the hell was that for? You've gone mad or what, Savio?! I've gone mad? So what were you thinking? I'm good for a little charity, a little house-clean... but a peck on the lips and I've gone mad? What am I thinking? What are you thinking? So what was all that 'we' stuff about? We'll clean the house. What was all that about? We, Savio. You and l, aren't we even friends now? Friends? Aren't you fed up of this friends bullshit? Back then we were friends, now we're friends! Why the hell did you say yes to him... when you knew you loved me more? Why? Just because he asked you first? No, Savio. Because you never asked. Are you mad creeping up like this? I would've knocked but there's no door. You could have at least cleared your throat or something... My throat is not blocked. - Okay. I came to tell you all... my decision. Romeo of Pocolim is going to make another speech. Anyway, I want you all to know... that tomorrow morning I am going for petrol. The only reason I am not going now... is because I am scared of the dark. And I can't cure that overnight. It is almost impossible... to conquer the fear of the dark in the day. Too much light. And also there's. I am scared of snakes. There are too many snakes in Goa. For the first time, Ferdinand is thinking. about somebody else instead of himself. I'm impressed. Do whatever you like. I'm not in a hurry to go home... as long as she's by my side. Your choice. You stay here, go back... Whatever. I am going to look for Fanny. Wait. Ferdie, come here. Come, come. Have some brandy. There is no third glass, Madame. Come. Sit, drink from my glass. Come. Listen, I don't want to fight. Listen Angie, screw you. What have you come back for? I don't want your sympathy. You think you're very tough... to use whatever language you choose to especially with a girl? Girl? - I'll smack your face, Savio. I'm not scared of you or your language... or your stupid attitude. Go away, I've nothing to say to you. That's always been the problem with you. You think something was there? What did you think was there? You and I were.. We were close, remember. We were 18, Savio. No, you were 18, I was 20. Shit. I'm such an idiot. Why didn't I just say it then? You know, you're worse than Ferdie. He at least said it but Fanny never heard. But you... proud Savio Da Gama... couldn't say what was in your heart. No, Angie... Now let me speak, okay. The first time I was kissed was on my wedding day. And 15 minutes later my husband choked and died.. on his own wedding cake. It's not the chicken bone as the story goes. The bride and groom figurines on the cake were made of plastic. Not icing. His mother was trying to save money. And her son was so drunk that. ..by the time he realized it was halfway down his throat. That was my first and last kiss and it was 6 years ago. You think I did something wrong by slapping you today? Huh? ls your ego hum? Where does it hum? You think after waiting 6 years... a girl would not like it to be done properly? No... I mean yes. So then finish what you started. Sure about this, I mean.. I don't really... No, I've had too much already. You have. Forget it. Too much liquor is bad for me, you know. It affects my legs. Gout? No. It makes them spread. You remember the old days, Ferdie? Albert, you and me, we used to have so much fun. Ferdie. Ferdie, thanks. You always knew about Albert and me. That bastard. I never asked you to... but still you didn't tell. Thanks for keeping my secret... a secret. Thanks Ferdie. Angie. Angie, you okay? Would you like a cigarette? Like a tradition afterwards. Angie, really are you okay? I am okay. Just... lying and watching the stars. Look here, I want to make sure you're okay. I am okay. Talk to me, baby. Despite what everyone says about men wanting to... turn around and fall asleep after... That's also a tradition? I thought she's going to come and check. Who? You were making bit of a sound. What are you mumbling about? Angie, you know who? Again you're talking about Mai. Why are we always talking about Mai? Don't be naive, Angie. What are you going to tell Rosie about us? Mad or what? Why will I tell her anything? What do you mean? This is a one-time thing for you? That's all this is? I didn't say that. I'm hoping there'll be many more times... and I'm hoping it will get better also, no? Better? What do you mean better? ls this the best it ever gets? No... but... I mean.. So, better? My sky. - What? You're in the way of my sky. Yeah, fine. Hey! Listen, if I had not come to you... you would still be sitting here and sulking. So let me do what I want no... Better? Somebody should go with Ferdie. He won't know what to get. You think he'll bring back apple juice in a jerry can? But what if he gets lost? He got lost a long time ago. Somebody's coming. Bring back some apple juice. Good morning. - Morning. Someone should look out for Ferdie. Of course, you go. You and M.F Hussain. You look out for him... while Hussain can look at more of you. Don't think I don't know what's going on in your dirty mind. My dirty mind? Wait till he takes out his paintbrush. Then tell me dirty mind. I don't want to talk to you. The moment is at hand, my lady. What are you going to do with this? With this brush I will awaken the soul that... exists within this beautiful body. And put colors on to it... the world does not have names for yet. With each dab of paint... I will give your beautiful soul.. a new skin. God will wish he had left the creation of women to Pedro. Angie, I am sorry. Sorry for being such an idiot. I don't know much about these things. And I don't smoke. But maybe if I did... I would be the one who would want to roll over and smoke a cigarette. after we make love. Do you understand? Yes. Put your hands up! And stay there! Madame Eucharistica. Drop the cloth a little off the other shoulder. I am not so sure. - Drop it. This is an, my dear. No compromises. Don Pedro, I'm not comfortable wearing this... I assure you, Madame. This sheet is not even in my painting. So, stay like this. Yes, that's better. Where the hell are those two? Don Pedro is painting a portrait of Mai. And she agreed? It's for the church. Church? You have not seen the famous Don Pedro's work... Church. This is beautiful. Seldom have I been so wrong... in recognising someone. How can somebody so magnificent to look at. ..be so completely empty from the inside? Where had your mind been... while your body was working its magic... filling itself out, becoming a deadly lure for the artist. You know the hardest pan of finishing this painting, Madame? Your eyes. Where is your soul? I do not see. So... I had to make it up. It's like making love to you and thinking of another. You're free to go. I am done with you. Dear Angie, madam Rosalina, Don Pedro and Savio... sorry for dragging you all into this. But I needed you all to help me start. I don't expect you to understand my love for Fanny. I understand it hardly. What I understand is this. You won't find anything by waiting... but only by searching. Angie, you're the daughter I never had. And you're the wife I hope Fanny will be. And I wish my mother had been like you. Whoever you touch is the luckiest bugger in the world. Even if they don't know it then. Don Pedro, I'm sure you'll make... "the lovely madam Rosalina famous in your painting. I hope each one of you fulfils something in your life. Will I see you again? Maybe, maybe not. I don't know. Good. Now we can go back. I guess its his own journey from here on. I mean... we were meant to be with him only up till here. Come. Wait. - It's time to go home. What do you mean by going home? How can we go without Ferdie? Have you all gone mad? Let go. And you...you don't care about anybody else. "but yourself. - Mai... You're selfish, you selfish... Good for nothing. That's what you are. It shou | d've been you that day. Not my Gabo. Gabo shouldn't have died. Leave me, Angie. Do you know why he married her? Do you know? Because he always wanted what you wanted. God takes away the good and leaves behind the trash. My Gabo shouldve lived. ..you shou | d've died. - This is not Pocolim, okay. This isn't your house. Or your daddy's village. And I am selfish? I am selfish? - Yes. All your life you've been strutting around... parading your false pride! and I am selfish? Shut up. - I'll show you who's bloody selfish, wait. Where are you going? Mai. - Where are you going now, you coward. Don't you do anything to my cat. Cat. Your bloody precious cat. Here. Your bloody cat has been dead this whole time. As dead as your bloody son. Have you fed it once? Looked after it once? Are we your pop's servants to take care of it... while you pose around like a model? And now suddenly Ferdie this, Ferdie that. All your life you treat him like shit... ...and now suddenly it's Ferdie. Ferdie my ass! Done with this shit. Hey, you found daddy's gun. - Let me die. Found his gun.. - Let me die. Let me die. You found his gun. Thank you so much for finding it. Do you know how much it's worth? How much? How much? What are you doing? We're going back? - What? I don't know what I was thinking. We'll have to go back for Ferdie. For Fame? I am the one who slipped the letter.. ..under his door that night. What? Found it when I was going through daddy's old stuff. Like everything else in life.. daddy must have messed up again. Yes, now I remember. Jesus Christ, you think even this is about you?! It's about your daddy, you idiot. Loyolla was the postmaster that time. Daddy was surely a man of many talents. Ferdie! Ferdie! Ferdie! Ferdie! - Ferdie! Ferdie! Stop the car. - Are you mad, stop the car! Shit the bloody car's brakes are failed! - Stop the car. Stop the car, Savio. The brakes have failed!! Give it to me. - Stop the car. Mad woman, leave the steering. Stop. - Leave the steering, you fat cow. Give me the steering. - Stop her, Angie. Savio.. I don't want to die. You stupid fat cow. Bloody two minutes back you wanted to kill yourself. Now you don't want to die. Are you mad? Stop the car. Stop the car. Savio, please. - Leave. Mai! Mai! Mai! It's okay. It's okay. Come, come. Where are we? We are okay. Idiot. Move. I nearly died. So did we. Hey... ..where's Don Pedro? I saw that bloody selfish bastard. He jumped off to save himself. - No. I asked for help and he slapped my hand away. I saw that, Mai. - You're okay? Don Pedro. Hey Hey Go, go, run you selfish coward bastard. Go! Great. Even after reaching, we can't reach. Let's find out where she lives? Oh, my God! Fanny! Which one? Where? Come on, Ferdie, go for it. You've waited your entire life for this. No, l...l think I'll wait only. Ferdie. Hey, Ferdie. Go on. You sure? Ferdie, wait. Fanny. Fanny. It's me, Ferdie. Fanny. What the hell are you doing? Oh, I am sorry. I thought you were Fanny. Who the hell is Fanny? Fanny. Stefanie Fernandes. Just get away. Stefanie is my mother. Where is she? No... It can't be. No. It can't be. Are you... You're sure it is her? Means what? She doesn't look like. She's wearing a wedding dress. Shouldn't she be.. - Recently married, no? I knew it. My Fanny waited for me all these years. And now she got married. Fourth time... What did you say your name was? - Ferdie. Ferdinand. She used to call me Fernando. Did she...ever mention that name? Yes...l guess there was. No, that was Kennedy. And then there were Joe, Joel, Jacinto... John, Peter, Joe. Mai mentioned many, many names. What a colourful life she had. But no, sorry. She never mentioned any Fernando. And that was it, really. We set out like brave adventurers to find love. Look at us... None of us would know love.. ..if it punched us in the nose. Pretending like we knew anything about anything... in the first place. Pretending like we were wiser now. I wanted to tell Ferdie that it was okay. But he wouldn't understand. I wanted to tell him that people die.. "but love never does. As for Don Pedro, his pan in our lives was only that much. I guess he must be stroking his paintbrush somewhere. ..thinking about Rosie with his strange kind of love. So yeah, love never dies. It's always there, somewhere. And sometimes you just have to find it. Even if there's no unsent letter waiting at your door. If love doesn't come knocking, just knock. ...even if there is no door.
