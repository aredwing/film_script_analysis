I saw you, Katie. Now it's your turn. - Go hide. I'll find you. - Don't peek. One, two, three, four. Ready or not, here I come. Johnny? Johnny, come out. I found you. Johnny? Johnny, are you okay? It's just another nightmare. Johnny! Here at Parker's Asylum, we strive to reach new levels of commitment in bringing new methods of treatment to our patients. Parker's Asylum was built in 1929, but has changed considerably since then. Although security remains foremost in the minds of staff at Parker's, the well-being of the patients is second to none. Access granted. Parker's Asylum is divided into two sections of treatment: the atrium and traditional psychiatric ward on the top floors; and the extreme cases ward on the lower levels. Upon entering the extreme cases ward, please stow away any personal items. Any unauthorized personnel please check in with the security station to the right. Have a nice day. This is a reminder that patients in the extreme cases ward are sensitive to certain forms of persuasion. Please refrain from casual dialogue. How's Johnny? Is he sleeping any better? No, I'm afraid not. Oh, that's too bad. Is he still having--? Nightmares? Yeah. I don't know, Karen. It's odd. It's almost like any progress we made together is undone by a single night's dream. I'm sure it'll pass with time, Jamie. I'm trying to help him, but... When my husband died, I couldn't sleep for years. Were Johnny and his sister close? Johnny doesn't like to talk about it. He internalizes. Mabel, I need you to stay in the corner. I'm coming in, okay? Looking forward to the day that I don't have to wear this anymore. Access granted. You be careful. I brought the picture like I said I would, Mabel. You can take a look at it, if you like. This your husband? Yes. Is it true what they say? What? That all the good ones are taken. I don't know about that. I think good is relative. Don't you? How are you feeling today, Mabel? I'm hungry, Doctor. If I'm going to help you, I need you to trust me. It's gonna take some time, but we can do this together. I know, Doctor. You've always been there for me, always treated me like a real person. You are a real person, Mabel. Jamie, can I call you Jamie like your friends do? Yes, of course you can. Well, Jamie, can I ask for a favor? That depends, Mabel. What is it? I was wondering if I could just lick your hand. I wouldn't bite. I promise. Just a little taste. You know I can't let you do that, Mabel. - You know the rules. - But you said we were friends! I know, Mabel. I'm sorry. Maybe we'll try again tomorrow. Open the door. Sorry I got you out of bed so early, kid, but I thought it important that you should be here. What've we got? Come on. Well, it appears to be a double homicide, but I can't be sure. The bodies are missing-- a six-year-old girl Lily Abbott and her 17-year-old babysitter. Neighbors called in a disturbance a few hours ago. How bad? Johnny, I called you in here for a reason. Elliot, what's in the room? As soon as I saw it, I had to call you. I mean it could be a copycat. The message is the same, but Wolf was never this messy. Are you sure? Johnny, I never said this to you, but I have to say it now. I am so sorry that I did not catch your sister's killer. I promise you I did my best. I hunted him night and day for 10 years. I got nothing-- nothing! On my watch he killed You don't know what it's like to close your eyes and see those innocent eyes looking back at you. Yeah, I do. But he's back now and we've got a chance to make things right. Do you understand me? I will not stop. Yeah. But where-- where do we start? I mean, the lab will find out nothing. The Big Bad Wolf. Yeah. "Little Red Riding Hood." But what does it mean? Elliot, could you give me a minute alone here? Yeah. Sure. Thanks. Johnny, come out. I found you. No! Help! Help! Johnny! The message is the same. The Big Bad Wolf. "Little Red Riding Hood." This is Gallant. Pete, it's Johnny. You got a second? Hey, Johnny, what's going on? I'm sitting down at my desk. Just working on a hunch. Can you run a check on any known addresses on one Gayle Abbott-- G-A-Y-L-E. G-A-Y-L-E. Got it. All right, Johnny, I have two addresses. One is downtown and the other one-- looks like it's out in the sticks. Give me that one. It's 65 North Hill Road. Thanks, Pete. I owe you one. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes. Close the door. A new mask for your collection? It's African. Masks are held in high esteem in some African cultures. They're believed to be the resting place for spirits. Some even believe that the spirits make the masks and they materialize overnight. You don't believe that, do you? No. But I think it's neat. Please sit down. So how's married life treating you? How's Johnny? Uh, he's doing well. We have to work on our schedules a little bit better, but... I'm worried about you, Jamie. I may have made a mistake putting you on the Hatcher case. With all due respect, sir, I'm making progress with Mabel. I think you're confusing friendship with progress. You've gotten close to Mabel, I grant, but progress-- I'm not so sure. But friendship is the first step with Mabel. I assure you, sir, that my latest report will show-- Show what? That she nearly took a bite out of you just now? You're lucky it wasn't Mr. Jacobs who threw that temper tantrum. Yes, sir. I need you to remember what we're doing here, Jamie. We want to rehabilitate, but to think that the likes of Miss Hatcher and Mr. Jacobs could ever reintegrate-- let's just say that there's a reason why these patients are kept separate from the world above. I won't give up on her, sir. Nobody's asking you to give up. It's important-- what we do here. But-- well, food for thought: Years ago it was believed that those who were afflicted with mental illness were-- were actually possessed by demons. Remember that the next time you let Mabel get too close to you. Dismissed. Did you find anything? That truck looks new. It's gonna be dark soon. We should call in some backup. Or not. God hates a coward. Shh. This guy is a real maniac-- a real maniac. Is that your professional opinion? In the event of a medical emergency or if you require assistance... ...staff members can be recognized by photo identification... Benjamin Jacobs. A real maniac? All of them. Why? Now watch this. He was abused as a kid, raised in a freak show. Hates the color red-- hates it. The beeping lets you know when he's angry. - Let me try. - No. Come on. Give it to me. Safety at Parker's is everyone's responsibility. Do your part to ensure a work environment that is safe for both patient and worker. What happened? - What did you do? - Nothing. We did nothing. - Marty. - She did it. Grab the tranq gun. If I can't calm him down you're gonna have to use it. Benny, it's Dr. Morgan. I need you to listen to me, okay? Listen to my voice and calm down. Benny. Fais dodo  Colas mon p'tit frre  Fais dodo  Tu auras du coco...  Fais dodo  Colas mon p'tit frre...  Fais dodo  Tu auras du lolo.  Are you feeling better, Benny? Yes, pretty lady. Good night, Benny. Reminder that every Wednesday the cleaning of cell blocks 8, 9... You are both very lucky. ...and 14 will commence. We all are. Please make the necessary arrangements with scheduling. God damn it, Elliot. It's not her. It's just a doll. He knew that we would find this. He set a trap. All right, you stay cool, kid. I'll find something that'll pry this open. Stay cool. Shit. Elliot, hurry up. Elliot! The Wolf has been caught. He's still alive. We can confirm the identity of the Wolf as one... Harold Grierson. He just let them die. God hates a coward, The Wolf has been rendered speechless, shot in the throat... It's doubtful that he'll ever speak again. ...by Detective Johnny Morgan. They haven't found the girl, Jamie. Johnny, you're alive. I can make him talk. The location of the bodies remains unknown. I'm sorry, Katie. I'm sorry. Thanks to the strong testimony and recommendation of Dr. Parker, I'm proud to say that my client, Mr. Harold Grierson, will finally be released into his custody where he can begin treatment... Looks like we're gonna have to make room for another one. Also at the courthouse was Detective Johnny Morgan, the officer responsible for catching the Wolf. Mr. Morgan, do you believe justice has been served today? No comment. Although the victims' bodies have never been found, this effectively wraps up the final chapter in the gruesome story of the Red Riding Hood murders. Season light  Season bright...  ...board of directors at Parker's Asylum, we would like to wish you... - Have a good holiday. Bye. - ...a safe and happy holiday. Hey, Jam, what's the deal? Why is everyone leaving early? Dr. Parker's just in good spirits. It's nothing, Marty. Have fun. In the event of a medical emergency... Are we still gonna go through with this? Jamie doesn't know anything about this, does she? We're separated, Pete. I wouldn't know how to go about telling her. You don't think she'll be at all surprised to see you? Look, all I'm saying is maybe you should give her a call, let her know. Mr. Walthrop, you can open your eyes now. I got you something. I hope you like them. Merry Christmas, Oliver. This is a reminder that every Monday... - Hey. - ...cleaning of cell blocks 3, 13... Sabrina. There you are. Oh, I thought I told you to not run off like that. I told Dr. Parker about Sabrina's condition and he thought he might be able to help her. She still not talking? No, I'm afraid not. Ever since her mother died, she's been so withdrawn from everyone and everything. I can feel myself losing her and I don't even know where she's going. If anyone can get through to her, it's Dr. Parker. She's in good hands. Quick, follow me. Stay behind me, okay? Please check in with the security station to the right. Have a nice day. Follow me. Mr. Grierson, I want you to listen to me very carefully. What I'm about to put around your neck is a proximity restraint collar. It'll shock you into submission if you break the 2' distance regulation with any of my personnel. And I can assure you, Mr. Grierson, it's not a pleasant feeling. Release him. Mr. Grierson's collared and ready for you, sir. Good. Oh, may I remind you of your meeting today with Mr. Grierson's attorney-- Miss Garvey? She'll be arriving shortly. She's fairly keen on making sure that her client's adequately cared for. He stopped being her client the moment he was wheeled through that door. I'll handle Miss Garvey. Yes, sir. Do you know who I am? I know who you think you are. The Wolf. You like that, don't you? It makes you larger than life. It scares your victims into thinking they're being hunted by a monster from their nightmares. I bet you think you can smell their fear. Well, you'd be wrong. Fear has no smell, no taste, no sound. It's simply a state of being. Your name is Harold Grierson and you're an animal. And as an animal, you can always be counted on to react in a certain way when placed in a certain situation. Behind me is an open door-- your ticket to freedom. All that stands in your way is me. Surely I'm no match for the Big Bad Wolf. Well, come on, Grierson, take me down. Claim your prize. Well, if you won't come to me, I'll just have to come to you. Come on, Grierson... howl for me. Wolves are smart, cunning, quick. They're not easily caught. You are but a common dog. Lock the door. If you'll have a seat, Dr. Parker will be with you momentarily. And don't touch anything, huh? Hello again. I'd put that down if I were you. That mask works like a bear trap. Touch it in the wrong place and the teeth slam shut like so. Sorry. I had seen it. I just wanted to touch it for myself. The teeth on that thing-- they're huge. Of course they are. The better to bite you with, my dear. I thought something like this would be in an evidence locker. What's it doing here? An addition to your collection? I had it sent over for study. Well, if you understand the outside, you have a better chance of understanding the inside. But yes yes, it would make a great addition. Well, shall we begin? Unauthorized personnel, please check in with the security station to the right. Have a nice day. I'm sorry, you don't have clearance to be down here-- Johnny. Hello, Karen. It's good to see you. Johnny, how are you? It's been so long. About a year, a year and a half maybe. I take it you're here to see Jamie. I was hoping to surprise her. I understand. Listen, I am so glad that the two of you are giving it another shot. Between you and me, she has not been the same since the two of you separated. Thanks, Karen. I'm just gonna wander around until I find her, okay? Okay. Good luck. Thanks. Here at Parker's Asylum we strive to reach new levels of commitment in bringing new methods of treatment to our patients. - We're in. - We're in. And this is? A gift for helping me on the case. Merry Christmas. It's fruit cake-- a little joke. Let's get on, shall we, Miss Garvey? Fine. I'd like to see my client. I'd like to see that-- No. No? He's just begun a delicate treatment. It would be a detriment to interrupt him. Dr. Parker, forgive me if I sound rude, but I'm gonna need more than your word. Are you telling me things have changed since the inquests of 1955 and '60 regarding the asylum's mistreatment of patients? When my father ran this hospital, psychiatry and the treatment of the criminally insane were uncharted territory. Perhaps some of the treatments at that time may have seemed radical, but I can assure you they were undertaken with the best interests of the patients' welfare. Including the drowning machine? Aquatic reinforcement. My father believed in techniques which utilized the concept of operant conditioning-- rehabilitation through punishment. He had built a machine that submerged a patient in cold water if they responded or acted out in an incorrect manner. But as I said, we've-- we've learned from my father's mistakes. Times have changed. You currently use restraint collars. The possibility for misuse is-- Nothing goes on in this facility that I'm not fully aware of. You have to remember we're dealing with dangerous offenders. Precautions have to be taken. Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind if I take a quick peek at the living conditions of my client. No offense, Miss Garvey, but the reason Mr. Grierson is not in the electric chair right now is because of me, no matter how good you look in the business suit. Well-- If the next words out of your mouth are not "Thank you and goodbye," I'm not interested. I run this facility and I make the rules. And you can just get used to it. And don't pout when you don't get what you want. It's not becoming. Carl. Sir? Have Dr. Morgan give Miss Garvey a tour of the facility and then escort her off the grounds. Only doctors should engage in personal discussion. This is the one. This is it? Yeah. And how are you planning on getting in? You stole it from Jamie? Borrowed. And I guess you know the pass code too, right? If she hasn't changed it. Access granted. Sometimes I hate you. Dr. Morgan, are you sure you can't let me see Mr. Grierson? You know I can't. You know, I saw your husband almost every day in court. It must be really hard on him knowing that his sister's killer is just a few feet away from his wife. - We're not together anymore. - Access granted. Sorry to hear that. Have a nice day, Miss Garvey. I'm sure you know your way out. You gave me this, remember? Yeah, and I gave you that. But we're not even close to being even. It's okay. I just want to talk. And since you can't talk, this is gonna be a little one-sided. Do you remember her? You killed my sister, you son of a bitch. Not so tough without your costume, are you? Attention all staff, Dr. Morgan, please report to Harold Grierson's cell immediately. Dr. Jamie Morgan to cell 22A immediately. Thank you. We've got to get out of here. Johnny, you heard the-- What the hell are you doing? Mind your business, Pete. Johnny, you said you wanted some time to make him sing. He's not singing. Sure he is. He just don't know the tune. I'm sorry, but I can't let you do this. Yes, you can. Let me do this. Johnny. You know why we came, Pete. You can pretend like you don't, but you do. Let me do this, Pete. I figured if I was gonna do something crazy, this would be the place. What are you gonna do? Access granted. God damn it. Johnny? What the hell are you guys doing here? Surprise. Back to your corner, Harold, now. Come on, we're gonna get you out of here before D-- Dr. Parker. I'm surprised to see you here, Johnny. Well, I was just in the neighborhood and I decided to drop by personally and thank you for all your tremendous insight at the trial. You don't think a man who dresses as a wolf has psychological problems? Not my call to make. No, it's not. I can appreciate your emotional predicament. Johnny Morgan, age five, witnesses the death of his sister at the hands of a costumed killer; age six through 16-- a problem child, moves from school to school; age 18, he finds a purpose, find Jesus, studies to be a cop; age 25, he's top of the class, becomes a detective, hoping to make a difference. Shortly thereafter his sister's killer reappears and kills his partner. How am I doing? You flatter me. Let's just say I could write a book about a boy who has the opportunity to kill his childhood demon and fails. Of course it would be a very short book, but nevertheless... The night's still young, Bob. Listen to me, son. I let you play your little game in there, but your fun's over. The only reason I'm not having you hauled out of here in handcuffs is because it would be an embarrassment to this institution and damage its reputation, not to mention the reputation of its lead doctor. I assume you still care what happens to her. I mean, someone has to, what with you obsessing about the past and all. I assume I can count on you to make sure he doesn't cause any more trouble. Yes. Hey Jamie. Pete. Jesus, Johnny, he could have had you arrested for this. You stole my ID card. Do you have anything to say for yourself at all? You're not wearing our wedding ring. What? Our wedding ring-- you're not wearing it. We're not together anymore, Johnny. We're-- I kept your name. Yeah. Look, I know this has been tough on you. If you want to talk, we can-- Don't. Don't do that. I'm not one of your patients. That's not what I meant. If you want to stick around, we can hang out after my session with Mabel. Sure. What about you, Pete? Point me in the direction of the kitchen and I would. Although security remains foremost in the minds of staff, - So how have you been? - ...the well-being of the patients... Good. I've been okay. You? Okay. Hey, you two. Johnny, I have been looking all over for you. You just disappeared on me. Yeah, sorry about that. Listen, Dr. Parker said that he is not going to be able to see Sabrina after all today. And I don't know what to do. We still have that session with Mabel. Don't worry about it, Karen. We'll figure something out. I can look after her. You will? I'm here. You might as well put me to some use. She doesn't talk very much. That's okay. Neither do I. Okay, listen, sweetheart. Now you be a good girl and you listen to Mr. Morgan. And I'll see you real soon, hmm? You little sneak-- taking my earring. When did you do that? Thank you. Now you be good. Promise? Both of you. So that was cool of Santa to give you his hat, right? Dear Santa  I'm writing this letter  To ask...  - My mama's dead. - ...a favor of you  I'm sorry. It's okay. I don't remember her all that well. I don't like to. It hurts, you know? A reminder that every Tuesday cleaning of cell blocks 5 and 15 will commence. Please make the ne-- Johnny. Nothing to worry about. I'm sure the power is gonna be back on in no time. You want to hold the flashlight? Miss Garvey. Excuse me. What are you doing still here? Wrong turn. Unlikely. Regardless, I don't have time for this. Does this happen often? The whole asylum is in lockdown. It happens whenever there is a power failure. It's a safety precaution. No one gets in or out. What do we do? We flip the switch and reset the system. If you want to make yourself useful, you can give me a hand. We should probably check to see if Dr. Parker's okay. Everybody calm down. I'm sure the lights will be back up in no time. Sabrina. Oh, sweetheart. Were you scared? Why isn't the power turned back on? I'm not sure. There's the emergency lights now. Here, hold this. There we go. And voil. And voil what? Wait for it. ...scheduling. We would like to wish you and safe and happy-- system error code 1. Now listen carefully. I'm sure the patients are a little frightened by the power outage, so be extra calm and speak... Temperature gauge-- was founded in 1929-- Good morning. Cell door unlocking. - You have to remember-- - Hey Jamie. Unlocking. Unlocking. - Listen. - Unlocking. Unlocking. Unlocking. Unlocking. Unlocking... Oh my God. System restored. Everybody just stay quiet for a second. Please do not panic. The asylum is in lockdown. Something's beeping. Find safe quarters and wait for assistance from the local authorities. I got it. Okay, we do it your way. But I hope you know what you're doing. Please do not panic. The asylum is in lockdown. Find safe quarters and wait for assistance from the local authorities. Benny, I need you to listen to my voice, okay? Fais dodo  Colas mon--  No? Okay. Marty, don't move. Sabrina, where are you? Benny, no. If you don't tell me exactly what's going on, I'm calling the police. Don't bother. We're separated by 8' of rock. There's a landline in my office. What was that? Come with me and stay away from the doors. Why do I need to stay away from the--? That's why you stay away from doors and that's why we have proximity collars. Hey, little chicken, Chicken Little. All right, young, tender fried chicken. I'm going to chicken-finger-fry you. Hey there, little one. Are you okay? This bad man is not gonna hurt you anymore. I'm going to the kitchen. Want to come? Well, come on. I'm famished. - Hey, stay with us. Stay with us. - What happened? What happened? What happened? Do you know your way around here in the dark? Yeah. Why? I need you to take me to the Wolf's cell. Why would I do that? Why would I do that? Because I need to make sure he's still there or that he's not. Why me? Why not him? He knows his way around here just as well as I do, so... You, Pete, walk with me. Do you have any weapons that we can use to round up the patients? No, all we have is these tranquilizer guns in case Benny ever got loose. They're supposed to have enough sedative to take down a large animal. One hit him in the neck and he didn't go down. Maybe he's a bigger animal than you thought. You know how to use this? Good. Don't be afraid to. I want you to split up into teams of two and find that girl. She's gone, Jamie. She's gone. She'll be okay, Karen. I looked all over for her. I can't find her anywhere. I can't even think about that. What about you, Johnny? We'll be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. You take care of her, okay? Sabrina. Sabrina. Sabrina. Sabrina. We should split up like Johnny said. That's a good idea. Pete and I will go this way. And you and Greg go that way. Do you still have your proximity box? Good. Be ready to use it. Just stick together and we'll all be fine. Karen, we're going to find her. I know. Sabrina. Sabrina. Sabrina. Sabrina. The asylum is in lockdown. Sabrina. Please find safe quarters and wait for assistance from the local authorities. The asylum is in lockdown. Find safe quarters and wait for assistance from the local authorities. I don't see anything. I'm getting help. I'm getting help. Round two, you bastard. Who the hell are you? I'm the hand of God. I came for ye who bathed in the blood of the innocents. You came for the Wolf? Yes. And you found me-- honest mistake. I'm willing to overlook the whole choking bit and turn the other cheek. You're no better-- a sinner just like the Wolf. Take it back. Soon I will bathe in your pagan blood for I am the instrument of the almighty and righteous Lord God, He who-- I will kill you. The hand of God is absolute and just. My God. Yeah. Sit down. Please. Please mercy. There is no mercy here. Sabrina, Sabrina, are you in there? Sabrina. Greg. Greg, is that you? Oh my God. O Come...  O Come...  All ye faithful  Joyful and triumphant  O come ye, O come ye  To Bethlehem...  Jamie. It's okay. Come and behold Him  Born the King of angels  O come, let us adore Him  O come  Let us adore Him  O come, let us  Adore Him  Christ the Lord  Adeste--  Fideles  Laeti triumphantes...  Mabel, it's Jamie. Go back to your room. I don't want to hurt you. Mabel? Drop the gun. Dr. Morgan, so good of you to come. Please don't kill me. Shh. It's okay. I'm not one of the crazies. You scared the crap out of me. Johnny Morgan? Yeah. Oh, it's you. - Small world. - Small world. I'm just here checking on my client and making sure he's okay. What a coincidence. I was just gonna go check on your client. And you know where his cell is? Yeah, but he's not there. He's not in his cell? And how does that make you feel? Better or worse? That's not fair. I thoroughly researched this case. There is no physical evidence linking Grierson to your sister. Listen, there's an eight-year-old girl down here somewhere and so is he. I'm not willing to give your client the benefit of the doubt. Oh God. Run. I don't want any trouble. Oh shit. Dr. Morgan, would you be a doll and drop your little gadget into that pot of water, please? Mabel, you don't want to do this. Oh, I'm pretty sure I do. Mabel, please. Do it. Okay. Okay. I did what you asked. Now let him go. This isn't your husband, is it, Jamie? No. Good. No! Girls' night! This is everything I ever wanted, Jamie-- just you and me, two gals alone in the kitchen, cooking up a storm. Mabel, what have you done? Oh, let's get started. Override lock. - Error code 1A. - Come on, come on. - Access denied. - Please please. - Error code 7. - Come on, come on, come on. - Access denied. - Work. Work, damn it. - Override lock. Error code 7-1. - Come on, come on. Access denied. Please find safe quarters and wait for assistance. How many fire codes is this violating? I see you've removed your collar. You're smarter than I thought you were. Shall we end this now? In the event of a medical emergency or if you require assistance staff members can be recognized by photo identification badges. Although security remains foremost in the minds of staff at Parker's, the well-being of the patients is second to none. What the--? Fuck. Damn it. I'm only gonna take one-- just one, only one. - Get the hell away from me. - But I only need one-- just one toe. Oh, Jamie told me about you. The blood is traveling to your head-- leaves less blood in your feet. Won't hurt as much. Won't be as messy. If you even look at my feet, I will kill you. I was only gonna take one-- the second from the last. You wouldn't miss it. I know it's not needed for balance or stability. It's not needed for anything really. It's the little piggy who had none. It's just not important. They're all important. Let me down. Okay. Where did you get that hat? The kitchen. The same place I got these. The kitchen. They're leftovers. Leftovers? Yeah. They-- they won't be needing them anymore. No. Mabel. Sorry. I'm so sorry. Don't think I'm done with you. Sorry. Now, Jamie, the trick is to gut them while they're still fresh. Now I know some people would disagree, but that's the way I like to do it. And you can maximize the amount of meat you can freeze for later. Now the next step is to take off the head just like a fish. We'll get the eyes later. Mm, they're such a delicacy. Now then you take a sharp cutting knife like this and you pierce the flesh just under the ribcage. Here, I like to call this a gutting knife-- you know, cutting knife-- gutting knife. Anyway, so then you make a straight line down from the abdomen just-- just above his wee-wee. Ooh, looks like he's been cut before. Oh, I can be so nasty sometimes. Now comes the fun part. Okay, hold these. Come on, hold these. There. Good. Oh, Jamie, that is so gross. You scream like a girl. So do you. You don't see me judging. Where's Dr. Parker? I was gonna go check his office. What are you still doing here? It's a long story. You think we should go in? Dr. Parker? He's not here. This doesn't make any sense. What is it? This is Dr. Parker's file on Grierson. You shouldn't be reading this. Okay, but I am. Look. if I'm reading it correctly, it says Grierson was already a patient here, but under Dr. Parker Senior's care. But the name on the file is Mason Crane. Well, I'm sure there's some sort of explanation for this. Of course there's an explanation for it, but this is the first time I've heard of it, and I'm gonna ask Dr. Parker why. Where are you going? We should wait here. Right? Oh, I could get used to this. On behalf of the board of directors at Parker's Asylum, we would like to wish you a safe and happy holiday. Carl? Merry Christmas. Jamie, are you paying attention? Good. Now the next thing we do with our rib dish-- we put it in the oven for 88 minutes, not 90. 88, and cook it at 375 degrees on the top rack, because we don't want to lose the vitamins now, do we? And then ta-dah! Simple as dimple pie. Between us, I'd say you have a better rack than old buddy boy in there. But friends just don't eat friends. I mean, what kind of person would I be to eat you for dessert, huh? I'm not saying you wouldn't taste good. On the contrary, I'm sure your tight legs are juicy. And with a cherry glaze-- mm mm mm. Oh, sometimes I get so carried away. Let's make the eyeball spread. Jamie, I gotta say I'm having a wonderful time. I'd rather be here with you than with anyone-- Now what did you have to go and do that for? Oh my God. Argh! We were having such a good time. And then you had to go and ruin it by stabbing me in the back. Jamie, I thought we were friends. We were, Mabel. We were friends. But what do you expect? You're cooking half my staff for dinner. And Pete-- oh my God. Jamie. Mabel, we're not that close. No, but we're close enough. Aww, did Jamie have a boo-boo? Mabel, please. No more "pleases," Jamie. I think it's time we made Jamie a la mode. Harold, it's me-- your attorney. Harold, listen to me. Listen to me. I found a file that shows that you were treated here before by Dr. Parker's father. Now they're trying to cover it up and I don't know why. But this is new information. We can get you a new hearing. We can get you to a new treatment facility, take you to somewhere that has some goddamn windows. Oh God. I just-- I just-- I just want to help you. I-- I just-- I just want to help you. Okay? Argh! I don't-- I don't-- I don't want to die. What a shame  To miss this  Time of year when all is white  We've been all so busy lately  Now I'm asking you to stay  Let's stay home...  Johnny. Johnny. Shh shh shh. It's okay. It's me. There's a really big guy around the corner. And we don't want to make him angry. Understand? Okay. - Where have you been? - Jamie's in trouble. - Where? - In the kitchen. Okay, I want you to stay here and only open the door if it's me, Jamie or your grandma. You got it? Got it. I'll be right back. Could I have the flashlight back? Okay. Thanks. I got an idea. Hey big guy. Remember me? Beat it. I can't. Jamie's in trouble. The pretty lady? Yeah, the pretty lady. Go away. I wish it didn't have to come to this and I hope I'm not making a giant mistake, but, big guy, it's time to get nuts. Hey. Yeah, that's it. Come and get me. Hey, Mabel, chew on this. Okay, big boy, let's see what you got. Johnny. Shh, it's okay. I got you. Johnny, Mabel-- she-- I know. I saw. She killed Pete, Johnny. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Jamie, I need you to be strong. Sabrina's waiting for us. Sabrina? Where is she? Grandma. Please make the necessary arrangements with scheduling. Johnny, wait. I just wanted to say something. Jamie, there will be time for all that when we get out of here. No. Johnny, I never stopped wearing your wedding ring. I just want you to know I never stopped wearing it. Sabrina. Sabrina, you can come out now. Sabrina. Sabrina, you can come out now. Shit. Holy Father Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done! - Sabrina. - Sabrina. Johnny, I'm over here. - Sabrina. - Jamie. We're over here, Sabrina. Johnny, I'm over here. Sabrina. It's okay. We got you. Thank God we found you. Hey, kid, it's okay. We got you. He's here. Go. Get out of here. I'm not leaving without you. Just go. Sabrina, go go go. If you want them, you're gonna have to go through me. Jamie, run! Run as fast as you can! Jamie, he's gonna cut you off. Go go go! Jamie? It's gonna be okay. Be strong. What the hell do you want? I'm sorry, really sorry. I'm over it. Now get out of here. She's gone. I'm sorry, she's gone. Oliver, if you know where Jamie is, by God you'd better tell me. The walls-- if you listen they tell you secrets-- secrets only the walls could know. I know secrets too. The spirits-- they're crazy too, you know. What are you babbling about? The land, this building. Listen. Listen. I don't hear anything. If you want to know, then listen! Listen. They hide deep in the ground. Your answer lies there. Are you the Woodcutter? Let's find out. Oliver, if we get out of this alive, do me a favor, put some clothes on. Sabrina! Oh God. Sabrina. Wake up, Sabrina. Sabrina, over here. Jamie. Sabrina, we have to get out of here, okay? We-- we-- we have to get out of here. Sabrina, wait. Grandma? Run, Sabrina, run! Leave her alone. Johnny. Go hide, Sabrina. Argh! Johnny! Johnny, run. Run. Johnny, no. Johnny! Jamie. Stay away from him. Who-- who-- who are you? Hello, Johnny. Dr. Parker? You're the--? How could you do this? Do you want my professional opinion or do you want the truth? My professional opinion is that as a child I was neglected by my mother and at the same time severely beaten by my father. During one particular example of patriarchal brutality my father drowned me repeatedly until I promised never to question his authority again, drowned me in the same cage where he would drown his patients. But with me it was different-- very different. The truth, you see, is much more interesting. You see, Jamie, when he raised the cage for the last time he brought up not only his waterlogged son but something from deep inside the well, something evil, something powerful, something with an unquenchable thirst for life. I don't understand. Grierson-- how does he fit in? Grierson is nothing, like a piece of clay at the hands of a sculptor-- easily manipulated, easy to train. Wolves hunt in packs. But ultimately he was a fool. Yes, I'd let him wear my suit, but a man is not the measure of the clothes on his back. I created in Grierson a perfect scapegoat for my past crimes. I brought him here so that I could watch over him forever. But when your husband decided to take justice into his own hands, I couldn't resist. I saw the opportunity to tie up all my loose ends in one night. You see, Johnny, in the grand scheme that's all you are-- a loose end. You didn't have to kill everyone. Karen had nothing to do with this. Well, the irony of a grandmother and a granddaughter wasn't lost on me. Speaking of which, I'd better get about finding Little Red. Why did you stop after all of these years, after Johnny's sister? Why did you stop? Who said I stopped? You won't get away with this. I can see the papers now-- "A Christmas Miracle. Harold Grierson the Wolf is Killed by Dr. Parker in Horrific Holiday Massacre. A Hero for our Time." But the Wolf won't be gone for long. He will return when the hunger gets too great. You killed my sister. I killed lots of little girls. And like all those beautiful girls, you too will find what evil awaits in the bottom of the well. Little Red. Sabrina, run. Get out of here. Run and hide! Johnny, Johnny, you have to get up. You can't hide, Sabrina. Johnny, wake up. Johnny, wake up. ...four... Katie. ...five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Ready or not, here I come. Johnny, I can't play now. You have to get up. I'm dying. I don't think I can. You don't have a choice. Get up! Johnny, please. You have to get up. Oh my God, Jamie. How do I stop it? You can't. He broke the lever. There's got to be another way. There isn't. Johnny, you gotta go. Save Sabrina. Don't let him get her too. I'm not leaving you. Listen to me, Johnny. You have time to come back and save me. But you gotta go now, okay? Jamie, there's not enough time. God damn it, Johnny, just go. Go. Go. You can't hide, Sabrina. I will find you. Hey, little girl, come quick. Quick quick. Here, you hide in there. Go on. Go on. Oliver, where is the girl? Uh, I don't know what you're talking about, sir. Aren't you a little overdressed? Aren't you? Where is she? Hello, Little Red. Johnny. Now... where were we? Come here. Come here. Jamie! - Go. - Johnny. Johnny? I love you. Johnny. Johnny, you found me. Johnny. Johnny. Johnny? Johnny, wake up. Johnny, wake up. No, Johnny. Johnny, no, wake up. Hey. Hey babe. Access granted. Good morning, Dr. Morgan. Johnny. Waiting waiting waiting  Waiting waiting waiting  Waiting waiting waiting  Waiting waiting...  Johnny? Waiting...  When your hands  Are cold  When the leaves on your flowers  Start to fall  When the trees  Lie bare  I will be there  I will be there  We won't speak of bitter words  We'll lay them down  Lay them down  We'll talk of blessings heard  And hold them close  Hold them close  When we walk  Along  When the time we have together  Is too short  I will take  Your hand  And I will keep you on the road  So you don't fall  These days will shine so bright  And lead us home  Lead us home  They'll light the time we have  And keep us warm  Keep us warm  And when the memories call  I need them  I need them  Oh  But when I scale that wall  I'll leave them  I'll leave them.
