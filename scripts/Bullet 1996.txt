You got the sweetest ass. You better straighten up because Mom's home. Dad's there. He's going to start in with his shit soon as l walk in the door. Just take it easy. So, Butch, what are you going to do? What plans have you made? Just looking around. You're looking around? Sol, please, tell Butchy about the job. l got a building going up in Williamsburg. l can get you on the crew. lt's up to $9 an hour. l already got you on the payroll, take care of your parole situation. You'll come with me in the morning. l got some people l'm going to see about some other kind of work. Oh, yeah, Butch? What kind of work is that? Sol, please. You're 35 goddamn years old! When are you going to start taking responsibility for your life? You fucked up all those baseball scholarships. You could have made something of yourself. But you're weak, you goddamn loser. - Sol, please-- - Cookie, shut up. You boys-- the three of youse--you're killing me. Just chill out. lt's his first night back. Oh, listen. Mr. Big Shot--sleeps all day, runs around all night with that fag Lester-- Lester's not a fag. - Cookie, give me another martini. - Yeah, Mom, make it a double. Listen, schmuck, nobody's talking to you. Your brother's got an excuse-- he's a convict. Your goddamn genius brother over here thinks he's-- What the hell's that guy's name? Salvatore Dali. Pop, it's Salvador. Salvador, Salvatore, what the hell's the difference? l break my ass to give you boys all the opportunities l never had. What do l get back in return? A convict, a schmuck, and a schizophrenic psychotic... who thinks he's a G.l. Joe. Michelangelo's old man considered art a profession of social disgrace. A lot of his art is a projection of his own emotional pain at home. l think l can relate with that. Don't break my balls. Listen, Pop, there's worse things than prison--your mind. Yeah, right. All three of you should be in jail, where you don't have to work for a living. l don't think so. You try watching some young cherry from the neighborhood getting his asshole reamed out by a bunch of murderers and rapists. You look at that. lt don't matter how bad you think you are. lf these motherfuckers want you, they're going to take you. You try living with that. Welcome home, convict. You're a very touching story. My hemorrhoids bleed for you. Pop...now, why can't you find me a job? l think it's really funny that the horrible convict over here ain't out of jail for 24 hours and you managed to find him a fucking job. Louis, are you going to have dinner tonight? What ever happened to death before dishonor? Louis, don't start. Come, put your teeth in and have some kasha varnishkes. Ma, l don't know where my teeth are. Pop, are you wearing my teeth? Can't you just feel the love in this room? What? l'm in no mood for your shit tonight. Do yourself a favor-- go back to your room. l'm going back to my room, and l'm going to make sure that you do not enter it. Louis, please change your underwears. They're filthy. l don't want to change my underwear. l won't be living here much longer, Ma. l'm leaving the country. l've signed up with an elite Special Forces unit. Don't ask me any information, see, because even if l were to get caught, l wouldn't tell them shit. l see the shrinks are making progress. Kid, what up? You're looking good. Amigo, your ride's here. - Don't give me any more of this. - l'm not going to give you-- l don't need this aggravation. Do you understand? What up, Tank? How you doing, man? Don't give me that ''what up'' shit. l hope you wasn't down with that bagel-eating motherfucker. What are you talking about? Bullet just got out of the penitentiary. - Yeah, so? - So? He robbed two of my best customers, stuck my man Flaco in the eye, and took off with my product and my cash, so! Tank, no shit, this is the first l heard of this. Honestly. l should have murdered that motherfucker three years ago while we was up north. Listen, Tank, what the fuck you want from us, anyway? What do l want? l want you to find the motherfucker and bring him to me! Would you stop? l'll find out what happened. You do that, Paddy. You do that, because if you don't, me and you going to have problems. You understand? Why you got to jump all over me like this? Why can't you chill out? l'll find out what happened. You got my cash? Yeah, l got your cash. lt's all there--24 large. Jesus Christ. What's the matter, you don't trust me anymore? l don't trust no-motherfucking-body. Until this shit is over and l got that motherfucker's head on a platter, you cut off. This is bullshit. You want to do something about it, little man? Chill. Paddy, you tell Bullet l said the only bullet he's going to see is the one l'm going to put in his fucking ass. You got that? - Yeah, l got it. - Good. Y'all get up from around me. Y'all stinking up my car. Smell like wet dogs in this motherfucker. Get out of here! Top of the morning, fellas. Let's go. Suck my dick, you stupid nigger. Fuck you! Fuck you! Fucking white boys, man. What the fuck are we doing in this spic joint? Come on, man, look around. Here, take a Spanish fly. Excuse me. Would you like to dance? l like the way you move. You look... You look, like, really, really hard, you know?. Looks are deceiving. l mean, come on, you don't dance? We could dance. Why don't you dance? l'll watch you. Man, why don't you loosen up a little, man? Sit down. Can't you enjoy yourself? What's up, bro? You got ability. You could do something with this. Get your head screwed on right, you could make some money, get away from all this bullshit. Listen, l do what l do. There ain't nothin' else to it. You ever heard of Pablo Picasso? Yeah, l heard of him. Picasso said that art is the ultimate perpetration of fraud. What he really meant was this is all bullshit. See, a piece of paper or the canvas and the paint, it all costs a few bucks. The finished product goes for a million dollars! What the fuck's wrong with a million dollars? Nothing's wrong with it. The thing is, is that all it means is something is wrong with the system. l'll tell you something--people love controlling other people, all right? Bro, we're only here for a cup of coffee. You got to take care of what you believe in. Eight years l ain't busted a nut. That spic broad over there-- l'm going to give it to her good tonight. Don't worry about it. lt happens to everybody. You know?. l like to be here with you anyway. l can jerk it. l can whack it. l could smack it. lt just don't work. lt's dead. lt's okay. lt doesn't matter. lt's okay. lt doesn't matter. - lt doesn't matter, okay? - Yeah, whatever. - l got to go, okay? - Sure, baby, you go. This is the not-to-be-missed story of how air power helped win... By September the 10th... Close the fucking door! Are you nuts? Tell me about this little journey you're about to take. Sorry, brother. That's confidential information. - You talk to anybody about this? - No! But l will tell you this because l trust you. l am going to gather-- Ten-hut! Sit! l am going to gather an army of invisible warriors. This time, l will have experienced, well-trained troops. Military force is not constant at--fuck. Victory in war is not repetitious. lt is constantly changing form. l don't expect a civilian like you to understand what l'm talking about... But you know that. Whatever form my enemy has, me and my unit will kick the living shit out of them and attain total victory. l love you. Chagall... There ain't no such thing as lovers Over the Town, not in this family, anyway, all right? You got Butchy to thank for that. You're too young to remember, but he robbed everybody in this household. He even stole your little piggy bank for a couple lousy bags of dope. Fuck him. Let him live someplace else. Nobody wants him here. Where is he going to go? He's got no place else to go. War is war! lt ain't fucking Monopoly! l had simpleminded, pimple-faced, inexperienced recruits not much older than you guys. Two thousand years ago, Sun Tzu, an ancient Chinese warrior, left behind secret documents on the art of war. l happen to be in possession of those documents. - Can we see them? - No, you cannot see them! - You have to earn that right, private. - Yes, sir. Get your mama's titty out of your mouth and talk, soldier! Yes, sir! Goddamn it! God-fucking-damn it! You needle-dicks don't know what l'm talking about! You ain't never been surrounded by North Vietnamese regulars. Seventh Cav, baby-- we was the best. Now, that was a war! l get a big pink boner every time l think about that. None of that limp-dick, Desert Storm, puppy-shit, smart-weapons bullshit. No, you're the only smart weapon. Stanley, you're the smart weapon. l want you to demonstrate what we did last week. Philly, up against the car. Here you go. Go ahead, Stanley. Okay, first you jab the knife in the throat. When you feel you've hit the spine, rip the blade to the right. Make sure to cut the two coronary arteries. Good. That's good. - Good job, Stanley. - Thank you. All right, Stanley. Too sexy for my car, too sexy by far And l'm too sexy for my hat Catwalk, on the catwalk Come on! Jesus Christ. Nice sled, Lester. Looks like a fucking Hostess Sno Ball. Just get in. My mother's on vacation in Florida. What's this garbage? Sounds like a chipmunk with diarrhea. l like that. What are you doing? Cost me $10.95 plus tax. You call that music? This is music. Bro, how come Paddy not making the drop, man? He's a fucking punk-- will not take orders. - You got a problem with that, Rico? - l got no problem. Watch out. Boy! - Come see me, man! - All right, man. You do what l ask? Yeah, l called that fucking Lester. l told him we got a smoker. Believe me, he'll be here. Don't worry about it. Look, give this to Pruitt. When Bullet shows up, make sure he gets that bundle. lt's got a red rubber band around it so you don't get confused. lt's got a red rubber band around it so you don't get confused. Think you can handle that? Yeah, man. Some kind of problem, man? Don't worry about that. That's my business. Now take this shit and get away from my car. Come on! What's up? Mazel Tuff! Where the hell do you think you're going? Get your ass back up that ladder and finish the job! Tom Thumb, listen, go follow the Yellow Brick Road. Screw you, wise-ass. Fucker! Fuck you, wise-ass! Motherfucker! l'll see you in hell! You guys wait here. l'm going to go in alone. Fuck that shit. l'm going in with you. Hurry up. This fucking place gives me the creeps. Ruby, you stay in the car. And it's smoking, motherfuckers. We got the toilet. Get back down here in line, man. Get back in line. Man, what you doing out? What are you doing out? - l thought you were at the state, man. - l'm a free man, Willy. How you doing, bro? Uptown? Downtown? What's going on, Willy? Yeah, it's the white dude with the black hood. Yeah, and the sweatpants. He just walked in, okay? You know l'm going to get the money, right? Bullet. What's up, man? Got some cash? - How you been? - Good. All right, all right. Over against the wall. He's okay. Let him in, man. lt's all right. Come on, hurry up. Give me a bag of boy, a bag of girl. Everybody on the ground! Now! What the hell is going on? Shoot her! Here he is! Give it up, Bullet. Let's move it! Just give him the fucking dope! - Give it to him! - Come on! Get out of here! Stay down, motherfucker! Don't move! Let's go! Let's go! Look out, man! Look out! Oh, shit! - Motherfucker! - Oh, shit! Want to play? Oh, my God! My mother's fucking car! Oh, shit. Motherfucker. My drawing hand! Man, without this, l ain't got nothing! l ain't got fucking nothing! l know that. l'm going to pull it out. Take a deep breath. You're all right. Come on. Wake up! What up, Bernard? Same old shit, Paddy. lt's hanging, swinging. Just give me the cash. You don't look too good. What's going on? You going to be sick? How much we got? What are you doing? You feeding my money to the roaches? Get this fucking thing out of there. We got a dead one over here. What the fuck is this shit? What are you doing? l just thought he was enjoying himself. Look at this piece of shit-- he's as blue as Elvis. He fucking stinks. Get him out of here. Give me a hand. Must have shit yourself. What's up, Paddy? That guy, he must have done something to really piss off Tank. That guy, he must have done something to really piss off Tank. - Mama, look. - Mind your own business. Stay close to me. You want some of this? l don't stick nothing up my nose unless its legs are wrapped around my neck. Good. That's more for me. Listen, l got another job for us tonight. Yeah? What kind of job? l heard my ma talking to the neighbor next door. They're going down to Miami for a couple of months. They're rich. Place is a gold mine. ln and out in five seconds. lt's a piece of cake. Jesus Christ. Your fucking neighbors? That's cold. Fuck them, man. l never liked them anyway. You know, you've got a serious problem. Are you going to wear that sweater? The black sweater-- you going to wear it tonight? Why? l want to wear it. Goes with my black pants. Do you mind? What are you worrying about what you're going to wear? We're going to rob a house. Man, you got any hair products? You got any gel? Mousse? Anything? You're starting to act like an old whore. l'll tell you something-- we go down, l want to look good. Stop bitching. Nothing's going to go down. Nobody's going to get busted. What do you think? You know, Lester... You know, Lester, you're a very attractive man. - You lose your nuts in jail? - You don't want to know. Thank your lucky stars, Lester. You're just a pair of zebra pants. Fucking pansies. Fuck! l swear to God, the country's going to shit! You want to go for a walk? Here, want to go for a walk? Come here. You should wear your coat tonight. There's a little nip in the air tonight. All right, we're in. Fuck! You're a disgrace. You should see yourself. Just shut the fuck up and give me a hand. Jesus Christ, Lester, why don't you make a little more noise? Let's just do this and get the fuck out of here. Stop being such a pussy, man. lt's a cakewalk. There's no such thing as a cakewalk in Brooklyn. Relax. Just chill out, man. - Enjoy the free ride. - All right. Follow me. Look at this shit. Shit belongs in a Motel 6. Your little brother Ruby paints better than this. You get the feeling you're being followed? Hey, Stein. Nice dog. What's his name? Captain Crunch. Easy, easy. Sit! Sit! Seems real friendly. He don't like cops. Oh, he don't like cops. Seems to run in the family. What can l say-- pits have good instincts? You know something? You and your brothers, you got a real attitude problem. Holy shit. Your psycho brother's outside talking to a fucking cop. Get away from the window. Why are you breaking my balls? Why aren't you out beating up some innocent Afro-American? Let me tell you something, wise guy-- l've got my eye on you. You tell your fucking brother l'm thrilled he's out. Man, l think your brother's on to us. Lester, stop being so paranoid. He don't know shit. You forget that l was with McGinty in the Fourth Marines, and he would personally stomp a mudhole in your ass and march it dry if he knew the way that you was treating me. What, you think that's funny? How come he's always got that weird smile on his face-- like he's got secrets nobody else knows? - Stein. - What? By the way, the war's been over for 20 years. l noticed. Oh, do l miss old Gurney Howard-- Gurney Howard, First Recon. l saved his ass in '63. lt was me that took that Chi-Comm grenade... Your brother's out there talking to his dog. l should have got the Medal of Honor! Ain't nobody else going to talk to him. l should have got the Medal of Honor! l got the Purple Heart... and the damn crotch rot. Fuck! This ain't bad. Not bad? We hit the jackpot. Oh, man. - Could have been better. - Can we get out of here? Lester, you got to learn how to relax, man. lt's all that shit you stick up your nose. You know, if l remember when l was a kid, these people used to have Oreos. How much do you think we got? We got 25, 30 large. We'll run it over to Frankie Eyelashes tomorrow. Frankie Eyelashes? l don't understand why we got to use those guineas instead of our own people. You forget the last time we did a piece of work? Him and his old man shaved 25 right off the top. l ain't doing business with them. You know what? Bet you with a little bit of effort l'd make one hell of a second-story man. Strictly high-class-- none of that nickel-dime shit. Believe me, Lester, you don't want to go to jail. lt ain't a pretty place. You'd end up slitting your fucking wrists. Yeah, right. l could handle it. Yeah, right. l could handle it. Fuck, man. You'd be sucking every fucking black dick in the joint. Take your nose candy. Let's go. Butch is a grown man. lt's out of our hands. lt's like l don't even recognize him anymore. - Looks like a goddamn degenerate. - lt's that damn prison. l don't think he's ever going to be normal again. Cookeleh, how'd everything get so screwed up? l mean, what the hell do they want from me? Haven't l been a good provider? Put the drink away, Sol. Get some sleep. Tomorrow's another day. That's what l'm dreading. l'm going to fix that fucking door. Jesus. At least l ain't the only one killing my parents. Shut the fuck up, Lester. Convict! What the fuck is that, Louis? This is a little something l've been working on. Can stop a tank at 500 yards. How'd your job go? What are you talking about now?. Twenty-five grand... Frankie Eyelashes...black dicks... Come on, all right? Lester, stash this shit at your house. They still got Oreos over there? He wouldn't rat us out, would he? Louis is a lot of things, but he ain't no rat. Fucknuts! Come on down from there! Thought l'd find you here. How you doing? You know, l been thinking... ...about that rat-face Frankie Eyelashes. You think women find him attractive? Women find me attractive. See this? See that? That's attractive. Women find that attractive. l've had chicks wash their panties on that. Have you ever looked at him? Have you ever really looked at him? That motherfucker wears makeup. You ever see his eyelashes? He uses that Maybelline shit. Why do you think they call him Frankie Eyelashes? See, chicks dig me for me, for Lester. - You're a real piece of work. - Come on, give me a shot, will you? Come on, you fucking machine. This machine sucks. l love you like a brother, so l'm going to be straight-up with you. And l don't lie. l mean l lie, but l ain't gonna lie to my friend. You want me to tell you what your problem is? You're going to tell me what my problem is? All this shit you talk about-- all the pussy you get, all the chicks you be banging... lt's all a bunch of bullshit. Lester, l know you. l know you, man. Deep down inside, you hate women. This shit's real deep. lt goes all the way back to your childhood. You don't even know it's going on. What, are you a fucking proctologist now?. lt's because of your mother. When your father died, who took care of you? - What has that got to do with anything? - Just answer the question. My grandmother. What's your point? You're my best friend. l want to be straight-up for you. l'm going to be straight-up and tell you as it is. Deep down inside, l think you're a latent homosexual. l'm a what? What are you trying to say? You trying to say that l suck dick? You don't have to suck dick to be a queer. You can honestly tell me that you never saw another dude and thought about it? You can honestly tell me that you never saw another dude and thought about it? No. Jesus, Ma, what stinks? lt's schmaltz and grundel soup-- Butch and your father's favorite. l thought it was stuffed derma night tonight. l'll never understand why you care so much about that loser. Louis, don't talk that way. You know l don't like it. l'm sorry, Ma. But things were a lot better around here when Butchy was in prison. You know, you yourself said that the only time that you and Pop could sleep at night is when he's locked up. He's probably out right now committing multiple heinous crimes. Louis, shut up. Okay, all right. Ma, look at this baby. Look at it. Very nice, Louis. This baby puts out 160,000 volts of pure dynamite! lt'll knock the stool out of any perpetrator that trips the wire in the backyard. What a lovely thought, Louis. How much are we talking about here? $63. That's a steal, Ma. That's an awful lot of money right now. l don't know if l could do it. Right! Right! No, right! Butchy's home, right? That's it. Butchy's home! Whatever Butchy wants, Butchy gets. Fuck me, right? You have to keep your voice down. You have to stay calm. You want me to go back to Lebanon? l'll go back to Lebanon and chop up some fucking Arabs if that's what you want! ls that what you want? Louis, let me scrounge around. l'll see what l can come up with. Thank you, Ma. You want me to make you something special? No. l think the Putzkys left their cat out. l'll nosh on that. Come on. She told me she's going to find you and put your head in a toilet bowl. - What's up, Butch? - How you doing, Frankie? He's back in the neighborhood. You know Lester. Lester the molester. What's up, Lester? Tony, take care of Lester at the bar. Come on, let's take a walk. How you doing? You just got out? - Heard you had a kid. - Baby girl. - What can l get you? - Sex on the beach. What happened with Carmine? - Carmine's doing 12 years. - Picked up for drugs? - Watch the fucking hair, will you? - l'm sorry. Can you move some merchandise for me? - l see you're reformed, huh? - Yeah, whatever. Come on, let's go talk. Lester, l'll meet you in the park. Vinnie, sit down. Carlos, could you get the door? l don't want to be disturbed. Yeah, this looks like three carats. Pretty good score here. We could chop this up. How much are you looking for? Twenty-five large. Wrap it up. l'll square with you later. We'll have a drink. l want to talk to you about that. l'll give you five grand now. Tuesday, you come back and get the rest. What are you doing to yourself? What have you got a fucking sock on your head for? l like you, but with my guys, you got to do things right. l ain't saying go out and get a suit, but take a fucking bath. You're walking around like you're still inside. You got a lot on the ball. You're underestimating yourself. You got to dress seriously if you want people to respect you. You got to dress seriously if you want people to respect you. What do you think, l'm blind? You keep banging that shit in your arm, ain't nobody going to take you serious. What are you doing, giving him any more? He's whacked. Bullet, been a long time, man. - What's up, Paddy? - How you doing, bro? - What youse doing under here? - Just waiting here for you. l was going to see you at the house, but l'm still scared shitless of your old man. - You know Fingers and Big Balls. - How's it going? How you doing, Big Balls? Now, Butch, we got to talk. Tank, he's on the rampage. He knows all about that fucking hit down in the projects. You're really fucking with my shit now. Then these wackos ripped off his best spot and killed a bunch of people. Yeah, l know. What do you mean you know?. You was there? Yeah, l was there. These guys, they took your bundles? He's trying to kill you with a hot package, Bullet. You understand this? You should consider yourself lucky. Fuck him. l did six months in the hole when l shanked that nigger's eye out. Let me tell you something, Paddy. lf that ape wants a piece of me, he can find me. l don't think you understand what the fuck he's telling you. Tank was coming after you, and now you got our shit all fucked up! - You're out of line. - Fuck this fucking guy, all right? Everything was cool until this crazy Jew came back. - Get over here! - What the fuck are you doing? Sit the fuck down! Let me tell you something. When you were still in juvy hall for ripping off old ladies' pocketbooks, that fucking crazy Jew over there was doing an eight-year bid for something he didn't even do! What the fuck are you talking about? l robbed the old man's liquor store. All Bullet did was drive the car. So how come he did eight years and you're standing here now?. Because he kept his fucking mouth shut, just like you should be doing. Look at you two fucking assholes! Look at this. Bullet's right. Fuck this fucking hamster. Think about it, Paddy boy. Now he's got us turning on each other. l ain't scared of them fucking niggers. All right. All right, let's do it, then. That's right. Let's set it off. Put that fucking gun away, will you? You with the gun all the time. You all right? ls this what you want? You do what you got to do. All right. All right. Come on, Paddy boy. Fronted me a nickel? He fronted me a nickel.

You know you fucked up, right? lt's all right, though. l ain't gonna kill your ass today. You think you're nice with your hands? Did a little time in the joint, big badass white boy. You got something on your mind, Tank, say what's on your mind. Why the fuck you wasn't born black, Bullet? You got the balls. You just ain't got the brains. lt's cool, though. l like a badass. l got something for you, though, Jew boy. l brought one of my lugs down here, and he's going to beat the shit out of you. He's going to tap that fucking ass, but he's going to do it real slow so we can all see the pain in your fucking heart. And he ain't gonna stop, so l'm seeing your punk-ass bleed. Payback's a motherfucker. You want your pound of flesh, nigger, why don't you do it yourself? How the fuck l'd look rolling around in the dirt with your cracker ass? That's why l got my lug here.

That's what separates us from the female of the species. lt's a natural law... in wild America. Today already. Come on. Sorry, you're beat. Let me ask you guys something. That guy Jesus, Juan, whatever his name is? Junior. - $800 he owes us. - He paid you. Where's the money? l don't have the fucking money. What, are you fucking guys fucking me, too? - Did you take your fucking medication? - No, l didn't take my medication. - You should take it! - Bullet took my medication. Where the fuck is this idiot? Oh, my God! What happened to your face? Nothing. You have got to stop destroying yourself. You know, it wasn't always like this, Butch. You were the most wonderful children in the world. Wasn't until you all got started with those goddamn drugs. Don't you know how much potential you had? Ma, l love you. Don't cry. l love him, too. You know, l know things ain't been easy for you. Ma, it hurts to see what happened to us. l don't hate Louis. l hate what he turned into. And l hate myself because l wasn't there for him. Could you tell Louis one day that l love him, and that l'm sorry about things? You know, Ma, l want to see Ruby get the fuck out. Ruby's special, Ma, you know?. He's got a strong mind, and one day, you're going to be proud of him. l got to go. No, we settle. lf she don't want to take the money, then offer her more. What do you mean you can't do that? You're my fucking lawyer, right? l got Shadow coming with more cash. l want you to fix it. Can you do that? Can you fix it? Wait, let me get a soup bowl... What are you talking about? Disturb me while l'm eating? l hope you got some good news. Yeah. l got some good news for you. l got this kind of good news. Here you go. There's your good news. You know... l hate when motherfuckers be trying to get involved in my personal shit. lf you was half as fucking smart as l thought you was, you'd be minding your business right now. You know what l fucking hate? When you try and talk to me like l'm one of your punk-ass niggers. - You're a jerk-off. - Yeah, your ass is fucking out. Let me tell you, we know all about your little hot-shot package. Let me tell you, we know all about your little hot-shot package. You're fucked this time. l'll see you around. You're fucked this time. l'll see you around. What are you telling me, boy? l'm trying to fucking tell you l ain't gonna be your rat punk! Get down, baby! Get down! Shit! Come on! When are you animals going to stop? There are children here! - Get the fuck out of here. - No! Don't take my baby! Come on, motherfuckers! lf you shoot him, l'll fucking blow your head off! Come on! Let's go! You see this? Your boys are dead. High Top is dead. Look at your boy Dallas. He's fucking dead, too. You know who did this? You did this! l didn't fucking do this!

We were fucking friends. We fucking grew up together, you motherfucker. You want a war with me? You want a fucking war with me? - You want it? - Please! You got it. You got it. Don't let this bastard off the hook. Let me fucking waste him! That's right. The children are the future. Let's get out of here. Come on! When you see me again, motherfucker, there's going to be gunfire. See those two broads over there? The one in pink and the other one? Five bucks l nail both of them. Watch this. Come on, man. Your package arrived, man. That's right. All right. Make sure the motherfuckers don't break out. They there. lt's on. Black Jack... you and Pudgy go to the front and flush them out the back. Come on, Tank, man. That's cold, man. You know, me and Hot Top been boys from day one. l don't give a fuck about a Bullet. Fuck a Bullet. He ain't shit to me! l don't see why you keep playing games with this motherfucker. He done took your eye. What else you want him to take? Had a chance to smoke him, and you let him go. Pudgy, l don't got time for this bullshit with you. Dig, man. l told you, it's that lrish motherfucker l want. l told you he was a no-good, back-stabbing motherfucker! Let me smoke his ass. You can tear Paddy out the frame... ...but Bullet is mine. You understand that? Bullet is mine. Man, that motherfucker got a destiny. What destiny? lt's a black thing, baby. You wouldn't understand. Oh, my God. Why are you painting on the wall? Because it's tacky. Thought l'd give it a little class. Who the hell is that supposed to be? Why don't you paint on a canvas like a normal human being? Well, l really can't explain it, but, you know, ever since l was a little kid, l couldn't help myself. l used to paint on anything l saw that l thought needed life. Even now, l see an open space and the angles are right, l'm going to create something on it. - l think it's beautiful. - You're weird. Personally, l don't give a flying fuck what anybody thinks about my work. Well, excuse me for living. What are you going to do with that? l don't know. Why don't we start by carving my initials in your face? You don't look so tough now, cue ball. Look, boys, l don't want no trouble. You should have thought about that before you pulled that bullshit on us! Don't hurt him! - You didn't say this guy was crazy. - We're out of here. l'm going to show you motherfuckers something. You boys ain't gonna last on the street. You'd better take a good, long look in that mirror, and you'd better look deep inside yourself, and you see what the truth is. Because once you get in this game... ...there ain't no turning back. Now get out of my face. l love to know that, you know, a child can see the color blue at 8:00 in the morning, and then some lonely old man will see the same blue differently at 12 noon. You see, it's no longer mine. lt's theirs. What's your problem, man? Shit! Fuck you! What the fuck's wrong with you, buddy? Let's get the fuck out of here. Come on! Come on. Who's the best-looking motherfucker in this place? - You are! - Who? - Lester! - Right, baby. Bullet, can we go? Those fucking clowns are right behind us! You got a death wish? Excuse me. Let's go over the fucking fence. Come on, Bullet. Give me your hand. - Give me your fucking hand! - No. l ain't going. Get the fuck out of here. Take the gun! Take the fucking gun! Don't go out like a junkie. Bullet! You fuck! Why are you doing this? Bullet! You fuck! Why are you doing this? Go ahead, motherfucker. Pick it up! Make your move. Babylonian code of law, Book of Tank-- eye for an eye, motherfucker. But you already knew that, huh, Bullet? You're a fucking waste. Could have been a contender. Save the fucking dialogue. Pull the trigger, motherfucker. Ruby, get out of here! Go home! Wait a minute. Let my brother go, man. - l'll pay you whatever he owes you. - l don't fucking think so. You can't pay me back what this motherfucker owes me. You motherfucker Tank. You let my little brother go. Let me smoke this nigger. l got to smoke somebody! Get your fucking hands off my brother! You're not in a position to say who can or who can't go. One thing for sure-- you on your motherfucking way out. Tank, just let my brother go, man. Let my brother go. Let him go, Pudge. l can't leave you! l love you, man. Go home. - No. l can't-- - Ruby, go home! Get the fuck out of here! Go! Run! Ain't this fucking sweet? This brotherly love shit. Fuck that. We ain't letting nobody go. That motherfucker going to sit here and watch you die. My business is with you. l've been waiting for a long time. Music over, motherfucker. Don't die. Please... You fucking motherfuckers. You fucking motherfuckers. l love you, mein kind. Open your pocket. Your brother wanted you to have that. lf there's anything you need, you call me. Payback's a motherfucker.
