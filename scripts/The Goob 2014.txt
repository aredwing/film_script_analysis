No, there ain't gonna be no fucking sevenish and there ain't gonna be no fucking burger bar until this fucking hole is dug. You understand me? Don't take the piss, Goob. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Boo. Where do you want your tea? Goob? Goob! You coming to the meet? You on the pull? Yeah, something like that. How's Mary? - Yeah, it's in there. - It's the same cut spring. Oi! Oi! - What do you mean, I can't drive? - You're not racing, mate. I've been working on this car all fucking week. There's nothing fucking wrong with this car! No fucking spring's been cut. Just listen. Just let me... No fucking spring's been cut on this. - It has been cut. - Shut the fuck up! - You need to relax. - Fuck off. Bunch of fucking idiots! - You gotta let him race. - He can't race, not like that. - No one's cut 'em. - Fuck it. Come on. You've cut the springs. You can't race. - Don't wanna fucking race. - You're not racing here ever again. Fuck off. - Hi. - Hi. I thought you were Rod then. You even smell like him. - Alright? - Yeah, I'm good. - That was quick. What happened? - I don't know. I don't know what you'd call it. Alright, mate? Battered sausage and chips, and a Coke, please. Cheers, mate. There you go, son. Get your chops round that. What are you doing? I brought him, Janet. He'd finished the hole. What the fuck's he doing here? I told you he weren't to fucking come. I've told him. He's now coming. - How you doing, Gene? - Don't fucking Gene me, you pikey cunt. - Did you fucking bring him? - Yeah. Yeah, you need to fuck off right now, boy! Come on, Goob. I'll see you. - Go on, go on. Fuck off! - Goob. Leave him, Boo. Come on. Goob, come on. - What time do you call this? - I went to the meet. Womack's a cheating cunt, in't he? Levi there? Goob. What are you doing here? Hmm? Hello, Mary. I just saw your ex at the meet. Nearly got his fucking head kicked in. Go to bed, Goob. Goob? Night. Good night. Yep, you got it, boy. That's it. Yeah, drop it, drop it. This is all about protecting our assets, boy. That's it. Right. You'll be sleeping light, boy. Watching. Listening. Now, if you see anything strange or hear anything strange, you call me. You listening, Goob? Fuck's sake. Why's he all wet? The boy passed out. I tried to wake him. We need to get someone in. We don't have enough cash, Janet If those boys hadn't fucked my car, none of this would be happening. I've got two boys laid up. Can't you just give me an ounce of understanding here? Just let me find someone. Alright, Janet. Just make sure they're cheap, please. - You one of Harrison's boys? - Yeah, that's me. - What's your name, then? - Elliott. Porsche? Yeah, Porsche. It's a nice colour. Take that. Take them. You've gotta go with it, Gene. I'm all you've got. - You like cunt, Elliott? - Yeah. I got a feeling you don't, boy. You see this patch? I call this Cunt Walk. Because in a day or so it's gonna be crammed full of hot, sweaty pussy. Just the way me and Goober like it. Ain't that right, Goob? Go! Fuck me, that's loud, Gene. There's someone I want you to meet. Fucking hell! It's not actually that cold. - It's alright, innit? - Well, it's not fucking warm. Come on, then. Geronimo! Oh, a show-off, yeah? There you are. Get your hair. - What you up to later? - Chillin'. Sure we'll find something. - Ma - What? Boys, you're gonna have to give me a bit of space here. - Here, take that. - What's that? What do you think it is? Womack calmer. - Hey. - Hey. Name? Look at that cock. What the fuck? Pervert! Rosa! Fucking hell, girl. See this patch, Goob? In a few days it's gonna be teeming with hot, sweaty pussy. Just how we like it, ain't it, Goob? Are you still thinking about that girl? You know you've gotta go and find her. Aye aye! Cunt Walk! Do you like cunt, ladies and gentlemen? Do you like cunt, do you? Fucking Cunt Walk. - So you think I'm funny, do you? - It was just a joke. - A fucking joke! - It was a joke. Gene, it was a joke. - I'm sorry. - Boo! Get the fuck off me! I'm sorry. Get off! I'm sorry! Don't fucking answer that. Take my Janet's dress off. Fold it up and put it on the ground. Take off your trainers. Take off your underpants. Mate, I'm at the bus stop. Can you bring my bag? Look, I'm sorry. I know. This'll help. Fuck me. My shoulders are killing me. Just need a bit of a squeeze. Well, go on, then. Fucking hell, Goob, I'm not a fucking horse. Squeeze them. Jesus Christ. Right, imagine you've got one of Womack's balls in each of your hands. Yeah? Right, grab hold. Now fucking squeeze them. Come on, stop being a fanny. Down a bit more. It tickles. OK, left. Keep in touch, yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah. Hey, Goob... I don't miss you yet. Goob. Get in the back. Come and pick you up in the morning. Hey! Oi! I cut myself. I cut my arm. Keep your arm up. Does it hurt? - Goob! - Thank you. - What's going on? - She's cut. Needs cleaning. Bring her over here. Let me look. Let go. Pretty little thing, in't ya? Eh? You'll live. Go on, take her back to work. Go on. Goob, hurry up. Boo! Time! - Fuck. Shit! - What d'you want? - I want the horn. - Take it and fuck off. For fuck's sake. Who's got the vodka? Rosa! Rosa! Rosa? Rosa! Come on. What is this? Do you have any more weed? No. I've got some in my van. Don't worry about her. She'll be fine. Come on. Let's go. What was that? It's nothing. - You sure it's the right van? - Shit. Wait. Wait! Hey, wait! Look, look! They're here! I've found them! Eva. Out. Come on. Rosa. Rosa. I heard about last night. Went to see Rod, got back late. - With some picker girl? - Yeah. Have you been to see him? This is a mess. We'll be alright, Mum. Mmm. It's you and me, Goob, innit? Hmm? Say it. Whose boy are you? I'm your boy. Hmm. My little koala. I'll still need this when you're 26. When you're 36. When you're 46. You're my beautiful boy. Set those fucking chairs out as I fucking told you. I got you a tin. Can I help? Best not. What are you doing, darling? That's gonna burn you. Wait, put those down. Very, very, very, very good. Right, now... I'm gonna rack these up and you... you're gonna break. Got a question for you, hmm? What do you see in that skinny little runt? What? Goob. What do you see in him? Do you know what we call him? The fucking Goob. You ever had a real man, hmm? Whoa. Hmm. - What did you go and do that for? - Goob! Go get Mum. Go get Mum? That's clever, innit, huh? What d'you wanna do, push her over the edge? What d'you wanna do, huh? Go and kill her? Is that what you want? What's fucking wrong with you, boy, huh? Now, you go and stop that girl or I'll break every fucking bone in your body. Oi! What are you... You fucking come here.
