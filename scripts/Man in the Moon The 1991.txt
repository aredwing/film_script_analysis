You love everybody so much. I do not. You do, too. No, I don't. Ok, you don't. Well, I don't. Maureen, sometimes you make me feel like such a baby. Ha ha ha. You are a baby. I wish I could be just like you. Don't talk silly. It's not silly. You're the smartest girl in school. You're so pretty it hurts. Boys fall all over themselves when you walk down the street, and Im just a lump. Come on, you're not a lump. You've never been a lump. You wouldn't know one if you fell over it. If Im so damned perfect, why is my head so mixed up? Mixed up about what? Well, I mean, sometimes things just don't make sense, and all of a sudden I get scared. Scared of what? I don't know. Are you all right, Maureen? I don't know. See, I don't know anything anymore. One minute, all I can think about is packing my bags and catching the first bus. And then the next minute, Im afraid that once I get out in the world, it's going to eat me alive. That's dumb, Maureen. You've got a scholarship to duke, and you're going to live in the dorm. Nothing's going to eat you. Sometimes I wonder if I shouldn't just stay here and get a job or get married like everybody else. Marry who? Somebody. I don't know. Billy Sanders? Good Lord, no! Do you remember when we were little and mama used to tell us, when things get all mixed up, all you have to do is tell the man in the moon? Yeah, you just had to keep on talking until you were sure you told him everything so that he had all the pieces, just like a puzzle. And then he'd work out the puzzle while you were asleep. Yeah, but that was kid's stuff, Maureen. We're too old for make-believe. Yeah, I know. Dani? Dani! Dani, are you up yet? Maureen, get that child out of bed! Dani, come on, get up. You're going to be late for church. I hate church! All right. You know, once your baby brother gets here, you women won't be able to boss me around. I won't be so outnumbered. And I won't be so pregnant. How do you feel? Not skinny. Another 2, 3 weeks, you'll be back to normal. Next time you have a baby, you let me know how normal you feel afterward. Can't you girls get in there and give your mother a hand? Maureen! These eggs are getting cold. Daddy going to his church again? Does he ever miss a Sunday? Why does he call it church when it's not? When he asked my daddy if he could marry me, my daddy said only if he agreed to find the Lord. And he says it's a lot easier finding the Lord out fishing than in any church he's ever been in. I think he's right. Don't think you're going to find the Lord with him. I want you upstairs. Brush your teeth, wash your face. You're going to Sunday school. [Bell ringing] Morning, Maureen. Well, I declare, you're just filling out all over, aren't you? Morning, Abby. How's the Trant family? Oh, just fine. Oh, and, Danielle, you're just shooting up like a weed, aren't you? Just like a weed, that's me. One of these days, that woman's going to cut herself on her own tongue and bleed to death. Hello, Mrs. Trant. Let me get that for you. Hi, Maureen. Hey there, little bit, didn't recognize you with a dress on. You look great, Maureen. Be by to pick you up about 6:00? That's right. See you later, Mrs. Trant. That Billy Sanders thinks he's such a hotshot. I don't see why you go with him. I don't go with him, I go out with him. Big difference. Dani! Dani, you come back here! She's doing it again. Whenever it's time to make lunch or do dishes, she disappears. The way she does dishes, I just as soon she be gone. Do any good? Oh, a little. A little means you did fine. Let me see what you got. Where's Dani? Off roaming around somewhere. She's supposed to be here helping out. She's getting too big to be running around wild as a jack rabbit. Used to be she was too little. Now she's too big. I guess she passed up "just right" when nobody was looking. Get out of here! Who the hell do you think you are? You get out of here! This is private property. Yeah, you're damn right it is, and you're trespassing. This is the Foster place. If your name isn't Foster, you're trespassing. It just so happens that it is. Prove it! Prove your name's Foster! I don't have to prove nothing. Nobody's lived on the Foster place as long as I can remember. They do now! So get your butt out of here! I'm not going. If you're not out by the count of 3, Ill drag your ass out! You're lying. ok! Ok, Im going! Turn around and close your eyes. Do it, damn you! What are you ducking behind the bushes for? You ain't got nothing to hide. Danielle! I thought I made it clear it's time you start taking some responsibility around here. Yes, sir. I hope I don't have to bring it up again. Yes, sir. Your mama saved you some lunch. Probably cold by now. All right. You making a cake? Mm-hmm, and ice cream. Must be having company. Just some old friends of your daddy's and mine. Go take a bath. You smell like a pond. # I will spend # # My whole life through # # Loving you # # Just loving you # # Winter, summer # # Springtime, too # # Loving you # # Loving you # # Makes no difference # I hope Im not interrupting anything. # Where I go # I hope you're finally done hogging the bathroom. What time you say that dance's going to be over? It's how many miles from the country club back here? You should have Maureen home by 11:20 then. Yes, sir, about. Not about. Yes, sir, 11:20. Hello, Mrs. Trant. Maureen. I'm ready. Not until you go get a jacket, you're not. I don't have one that goes with this dress. Then put on a different dress. You got a full tank of gas? Yes, sir. No detours, no back roads, no liquor. What time you got? You're responsible for my daughter for the next 5 hours and 7 minutes. Yes, sir, Mr. Trant. You don't have a thing to worry about. Then neither will you. Abby: Have a nice time. She'll be fine. I remember his father at his age. What? I said, I remember his father at his age. Mama, do I have to wear a skirt? Mm-hmm. Who's so important that I have to wear a skirt? When your mama tells you to do something, you don't stand around asking her reasons. You smell good. You mean I don't stink anymore? [Horn honking] They're here. You boys come back here. I warned you what would happen if you two didn't behave. Them two is as mean as snakes. You haven't changed a bit. Neither have you. Come here to me, girl. Oh. You was in the same shape last time I saw you. I know. Matt, don't you know what keeps causing this? Matt's after that boy he's wanted all these years. If you wanted a boy, you never should have throwed me over for Abby. Court, let Matt and Abby look at you. They haven't seen you since you was in diapers. Those heathens are my last efforts. Rob, say hello. Dennis, quit scratching yourself in front of people. This is Danielle. We call her Dani. That little bundle is Missy. She rules the roost. I'm sure she does. Your kids turned out prettier than you, Matt. You really that shy, or you putting on? Court, come here. Quit moseying. Hello, Court. Mr. Trant. Ma'am. Those are some fine-looking boys you got, Marie. I hope to tell you. Court, tie those two to a tree. Ha ha ha. Well, look at that corn. I haven't got a thing in the ground. It's corn, but it's short. Abby: No ears on that corn. This corn's good. It's store-bought. I'm hungry enough to eat one of these kids. Might be about ready. Good. Where's your Maureen? Gone to a dance. With Will Sanders' son. Will Sanders? What's old Will Sanders up to? Running his new shirt factory. And his big mouth, as usual. Billy! Billy! Damn boy's deaf. Billy! Hey, Billy! Hey, boy. Billy, you got yourself one pretty little woman tonight. I hope he didn't drive too fast. Honey, we're certainly glad you could join us, aren't we, Ilene? Maureen, it's so nice to see you. Thank you for inviting me. You're a sight for this old boy's eyes. I can't see how Billy got so lucky. Let's find ourselves something to drink. Let's grab some food, jump in the car, and get off by ourselves. I got dressed up to go dancing. That's what Im going to do. You want to go off, you can go by yourself. Don't hit me! Don't hit me! Boys, I want you to stay in the yard where I can see you. And no tree climbing! What goes up must come down. I remember that much from school. Has it really been that long? Mm-hmm. I had Dani about a month after y'all moved off. We were really sorry to hear about Beau. I always knew the damn pipeline would kill him. Only I thought it would be a little at a time. Anyway, it seemed like the best thing for the boys and me was to come back to the farm. Yeah. You can always get some sort of living out of good land. Matt: That's it. Have you ever wondered what would have happened if Matt and Beau hadn't switched partners at that dance I wondered. But, hell, honey, you had a crush on Matt from the time you was 12. He was 17 years old. He didn't know I was alive. I thought I was going to have to get naked, paint myself red, and set off dynamite to get his attention. Well... you got him. Yeah, I did. Mama, this thing ain't working. Well, what's wrong with it? I don't know. It needs some more salt. Well, we're out of salt. Matt, we're going to need some more rock salt. Daddy, Ill go with you. Court, could you run into town for me? Sure. Dani will show you where. Dani! Come on. You don't have to come along. I can find the store by myself. It's an awful big town. You always go where you're not wanted? You always act ugly to people you meet, or you practicing to be a horse's butt? Little girls shouldn't talk nasty. I'm not a little girl. I'm 14. My goodness. You're not much older. 16? I'm 17. My goodness. [Horn honking] You never give an inch, do you? No. Good. I like that. Well, you coming? Hey, wait! Hey, thanks. Hey, what is that? [Record player] # O-only you # # Can make # # All this world seem right # # Only you # # Can make the darkness bright... # Billy tells me you're fixing to leave for duke in a couple of weeks. That's right. I get up to Raleigh Durham once or twice myself on business. That's nice. I'll look you up, take you out. I imagine they'll keep me pretty busy studying. I understand freshmen really have to hit the books at duke. You can't study all the time. Everybody has to have a little fun. I just want you to understand that I know that college can be a real drain on the family's finances. There's no need for a pretty girl like you to go without anything. Things get a little tight, Ill be there. I just want you to know that. Thank you. I'll manage just fine. You won't mind if I borrow my date for a while, will you? Not at all. Not at all. It's a pleasure. Pleasure. Sorry about my old man. Let's just get out of here now. Billy... Billy, stop it! I mean it! What is it with you, Maureen? You wanted to leave the dance, we left the dance. I thought you wanted us to be alone. I wanted to get away. I was tired of being manhandled. Can't you just hold me a little, Billy? I don't think so, Maureen. Nobody can just hold you a little. What do you want from me? I don't know. I don't know, either. It's bothering me. It's bothering me, too. I can't take it anymore. I can't either. Do you ever feel like there's something missing? Like there's something you've been waiting for all your life and you wonder whether you'll ever have it? I'm feeling like that right now. I think love should be so beautiful. And powerful. I want to be swept away by love. Oh, Billy. Billy, what are you doing? Maureen, please. I have to go home now. No, you don't. We have a whole hour. No, I have to go now! There are plenty of girls who'd be dying to be in your spot. Billy, I want to go home! If I take you home now, I won't be back. All right. It's probably for the best. [Tires squeal] Good night, mama. Good night, daddy. Good night. # Well, that's all right, mama # # That's all right for you # # That's all right, mama # # Just any way you do # # That's all right # # That's all right # # That's all right, my mama # # Any way you do # # Well, mama, she done told me # # Papa done told me, too # # Son, that gal you foolin' with # # She ain't no good for you # # But that's all right # # That's all right # # That's all right, my mama # # Any way you do # Rob! Dennis! Cut that jackassing around and get that stuff over here. Aah! Anything for me? Not much here but flyers and bills. Your friends will get around to writing. Yeah, sure, when they have time. Now, you're not going to be lonely forever. Once school starts, you'll be making new friends, playing football. Then you'll be the one who doesn't have time to write. I don't think Im going to play much football. You'll get this place under control. We do what we have to do, son. You got too much of your daddy in you to let this job be bigger than you are. We have to find a way to get a tractor. Maybe we can find a secondhand one that'll run. Can we afford it? Nope. But we can't afford not to, either. [Humming] Cut some beans for mama. # That's all right # # That's all right # [Humming] I'm going to the library. That would be my guess. Here. What has come over her? I don't know. # That's all right # Yaaa! [Splash] Hey! Hey yourself. Come on in. You just going to stand there all day, or what? Come up and jump with me. All right. So you do own a bathing suit. You ready? Sure. Just hold on, ok? Ok. go! Aah! [Humming] Maureen? What's it like to kiss a boy? It depends on the boy. Are you talking about anybody in particular? I was just asking a question. Can't anybody ask a question around here? For starters, you let him kiss you if you like him. If you don't like him, just tell him you're not that kind of a girl. What if you like him a lot? Then you won't have to think about it. It'll all come to you. You're not telling me anything. I need to know what to do. Ok. Come here. Come on. First, you'll have to kind of tilt your head to one side. That's so you won't bump noses. Ok. Would you loosen up? He'll think you're scared of him. Not that much. Ok. Then kind of open your mouth just a little... uh-uh. You wanted to know how. I am telling you how. Look, practice on your hand, ok? That's it. Just keep practicing. Well, what if I forget what to do? Just do what you feel. If I do what I feel, Ill burst into a million pieces and go flying out into space. That sounds to me like a good way not to get kissed twice. Maureen, have you ever liked somebody so much, it almost made you sick? Billy Sanders makes me sick every time I look at him. You know what I mean. It's like my stomach ties up in knots and I can't breathe and sometimes I think Im going to throw up. Well, don't throw up, Dani. Whatever you do, don't throw up. Hey. Thank you. It's nice of you. I figured you'd be out here. I figure Ill be out here for a long time. It sure is hot. Sure is. Yeah. It's going to get hotter, too. It'd sure be nice to go for a swim. I can't take off and go swimming with you, Dani. I got to make the most of the daylight. I can go swimming after dark. What are your folks going to say? They won't say anything. Ok. How are things going at the Murphy house? We finished framing up. Now if we could get it blacked in before we get a rain, the rest of it ought to go pretty smooth. You'll do fine. The way it looks now, you'll pray for rain by the end of summer. Matt: Come on, honey. Join us at the table. Missy: Ok. Matt: Dani, put your napkin in your lap. Court! Court! Aah! Hey, kid. I'm not a kid. Sure you are. You're my favorite kid in the whole world, though. Come on! Hello. Come on. Come on. Court, what's wrong? Nothing's wrong. What did I do? Nothing. Just tell me what I did wrong. I said you didn't do anything. Have you ever been kissed before? Sure. Lots of times. I'll bet. You almost got more than kissed, little girl. I'm not a little girl. You are, too, Dani! You don't know what you're doing. One day, somebody's going to get your cherry, but it's not going to be me. I wouldn't like myself for it. [Thunder] Dani. [Thunder] [Baby babbles] Dani! Dani! Dani! Dani! Dani! Dani! Dani! Mama! Mama! Dani! Dani! Mama! Abigail? Mama? My god! Abigail? Oh. Ow! Dani. Where's Dani? Get my keys. Where were you? What were you doing? Call the hospital. Tell them Im on my way. Get in the house! Get inside the house now! How is she? I told you to go home. Are they set up in i.c.? Somebody tell me something. Go home, Matt. Please. God damn it, doc. Tell me. Abigail has a concussion. She's got toxemia. Her body's not throwing off poisons. It's collecting it. There's nothing you can do except get in the way. Go home. I want you out of here now. Daddy, don't! Daddy! Daddy! [Dani sobbing] Ma? Just stay here. Mom asked me to bring this stuff by. Some homemade soup and, uh... yeast bread, and chocolate pie. Mom's got the world beat making chocolate pie. Where's everybody at? Hospital. I'm real sorry about your mama. I'm sorry about the way I acted last night, too, about the way I said everything. You don't have to be sorry. I thought we could still talk sometime, you know. I figure if we can talk and be friends, I can get you to understand. I already understand. Thanks for bringing the food over, Court. That was a good supper Marie sent over. Marie's boy bring it over? Court? Yes, sir. He your swimming partner last night? Yes, sir. Did anything happen? No. Don't you mean "no, sir"? No, sir. Nothing happened, sir. I saw the way you looked last night. Did that boy try anything with you? No, sir. No, siree. Not Court Foster. Abby? I... I know. I love you, too. This... all of this is my fault. If I hadn't been so set on getting a son... oh, honey. You're not trying to take credit for all of this by yourself, are you? Because I seem to remember helping out a little bit. If I would have lost you, Abby... mama says I can come in tomorrow and let Maureen stay home with missy. That's good. Daddy... I know you feel bad about taking the strap to me, but Im not mad or anything. You were scared, worried about mama and the baby. I know that. And Im just awfully sorry for what I did. And for everything. Hey, Court! Hey! Hey yourself. Still want to be friends? I'd still consider it. Well, I was just wondering where you do your best considering. Aah! I don't have a suit. Ha! I won't look. Yee-haw! Friends, ok? Friends. Ok. You can look now. And what makes you think Id want to do that? You did in the water. I did not. You could've fooled me. Ow. Court... I want to know you. You do know me. I want to know you more. I want to know you all I can. What do you want to know? I want to know... your hopes. My hopes. Well... I hope your boobs get bigger and your butt fills out. Court! Seems like it always comes to this, doesn't it? Have you kissed a lot of girls? Not a whole lot. I want you to be the first boy to ever kiss me. I thought you'd been kissed so many times. How was that? Perfect. Dani? You like that boy of Maries a lot, don't you? But you know you're not old enough to date. Yes, sir. You want to see Court, do it right. Invite him over here to the house. I'm not saying you can't go to the pond anymore or that you can't go there with Court. Just bring him around once in a while where I can get a good look in his eyes. Yes, sir. All right. Good to see you, Court. Good to see you, too, Mr. Trant. How's your mama? She's fine. She got a job at the shirt factory. That's good. She always was a good worker. Yes, sir. Dani tells me that your wife's doing better. That's right. Better every day. Well... you kids have a nice time. I'm going to see Abby. Your sister will be here shortly. You can sit down if you like. Sure. What's the matter with you? Nothing's the matter. I'm letting you kiss me. Weren't you supposed to let me try first? [Car approaching] Hi there. Hi. Let me help you with those things. Thank you. I'd appreciate that. You must be Court. I've been meaning to come by to visit with your mother and say hi. I've been busy getting ready for school that I didn't get around to it. I promise Ill do it. Tell your mother that? Sure. She'll be glad to see you. Thanks. Any time. You can set these things down, and I can put them up. You must be Maureen. I forgot to say that, didn't I? You two can go back to whatever you were doing. I can handle this. Court, you want to go walking? Why don't you two do that, and, uh... Ill have dinner ready by the time you get back. You're welcome to stay for supper if you'd like. Isn't he, Dani? Sure. Great. That's fine. I'll set the table. Show me where the things are. I think we ought to have supper in the dining room, don't you, Dani? Whatever. Court, the last time we saw each other, we were both running around in our diapers. I'll bet that was a sight. Mama says I used to beat you up regularly with my sand pail. I wouldn't try that these days. Everybody dig in. I, uh, imagine that you work up quite an appetite handling the farm all by yourself like that. It's a lot of work. I can't imagine having the guts to tackle a job that big. Yeah, well, sometimes I wonder if Ive bitten off more than I can chew. I bet you'll do just fine. [Clunk] Are you ok? Sure. I'm just fine. Well, thanks for dinner. You're welcome. It was nice meeting you. Good night. Oh, good night, kid. Court seems real nice. He kiss you yet? All the time. Is he a good kisser? He's all right. Shit. Hey. I was just going down to the pond. You want to go? I've got work up to my eyeballs and no end in sight. There's nobody to tell me how to do it. It all depends on me. I can't play whenever you want to. You don't have to sound so hateful. I don't have time! Sorry I took your time. Maybe if you were a little bit older, you'd understand. If I were older, I could do everything, couldn't I, Court? I love you, Court. Don't. Don't love me now when things are so mixed up. I've got more than I can say grace over right now. You look real nice. I think Ill go out for a little while. You going over to the Trants' again? I might. I saw Maureen at the hospital today. That girl sure is turning out. You see Matt, you tell him to holler at me if he needs anything. Yes, ma'am. Ok, guys, let's go! Get out. Come on. I'll see you later, ok? My, my, my. Night-night. Ok, we're going to go night-night. Oh, there we go. There we go. [Car door opens] Here's your doll. [Knock on door] Court. Hello. Hi. Dani is at the hospital if you want to run on down and visit with her. I don't think so. It, uh, sure was a nice day. Yeah. Looks like it's going to be a nice night, too. Looks like. Yeah, looks like. [Radio static] I'll sure be glad when I can leave this place and take you with me. Why don't you go home and get some sleep for a change? I'll see you in the morning. Call me if anything happens. Yes, sir. I will. [Music plays] Thanks. So, do you like Elvis? Sure. Who doesn't? Dani absolutely adores him. Well, she did until you came along. You... pretty well shot Elvis out of the saddle. I can't believe my little sister is grown-up enough to have a boyfriend. It's not quite exactly like that. I mean... it's more like we're sort of buddies. Just... real close buddies. Does Dani know that? I tried to tell her. You like her a lot? Of course I like her. I mean, she's... special. Oh. Yeah, she, um... she is that. But what if I met someone else... someone special in a different sort of way? Someone... she's my sister. If you... need a friend, I make a pretty good one. A friend's not what I need right now. [Telephone rings] You better go. [Ring] [Ring] Daddy! The hospital called. Mama's having the baby. All right. I'm on my way. Ok. I'm glad you're the one here with me. Me, too, mama. You're not frightened? No, mama. Good. Are you scared? Not a bit. I've done this before, remember? Aah. Lord, Court. [Baby crying] Hope you ordered a girl, Abigail. I know someone who's going to be mighty disappointed. Matt had his heart set on a boy. Want me to put it back? God, no. Court! Hey, Court! Where are you? Court! We've got a girl! She's just the tiniest thing and perfect all over, except she's baldheaded. And I was there for the whole thing. They didn't actually let me go in, but I was there. It was beautiful. Anyway... I couldn't wait to tell you about the baby. And I wanted to apologize for the last time I saw you. I was being unreasonable. But when two people really care about each other... well, when two people really care... they try to understand things, even when it's hard. Don't you think so? Yeah. Sure. Well, Ill see you, ok? Yeah. I never thought I could feel this way. It's like, Ive been waiting for you to come back and find me, and... now Im afraid it'll all go away. I'm not going anywhere. Come on, Dani. Unlock... door. He's unlocking it. Daddy's going to open it. Come on, missy. Let's put the baby to bed. Maureen! Maureen! Where could she have gotten off to? She knew we'd be back about noon. [Giggling] I love you. I love you, too. I have to go. What are we going to do? Don't think about that. We have to think about it. Not yet we don't have to. Yes, we do. I have to go. I'll see you later. Court, come on. Stop it. You're going to make me late. Dani, I need to talk to you. Maureen! Maureen, can you get in here, please? Where have you been? The baby's home. All right, boys. Got to take your brother his lunch. He forgot it again. Boy can't remember his name these days. I want you to sit there, eat your lunch, and no messing around, you hear me? Do you hear me? Yes, ma'am. Court? Court! Court! [Moaning] Baby boy. [Sobbing] Court? Go away, Dani. Go away, Dani! Go away! Daddy! Daddy! Dani? Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Dani, what's the matter? What's the matter? It's Court. What? The tractor... it's Court. Help! Abby! Abby! No! No. No. No. No. No. Dani... Im sorry. We didn't mean to hurt you, Dani. I love you... and I need us still to be close somehow. I don't want to be close to you anymore, Maureen. I don't ever want to be close to you again. Mama? Mm-hmm. I don't want to be at church today. Can I go with daddy, please? All right. Mama, I loved him. I don't know how to stay alive without him. I know. I'm sorry. Oh. I'm so sorry. You know, Dani... you and Maureen are going to be sisters for a long time. Don't ask me to forgive her... because I can't. You've got a right to grieve, Dani. You got a right to be hurt. But if you get so wrapped up in your own pain that you can't see anyone else's, then you might just as well dig yourself a hole... and pull the dirt in on top of you, because you're never going to be much use to yourself... or anyone else. You don't know what she did. I know enough. I know hating your sister is not going to bring Court back. Maureen's been good to you all your days. Remember that. She's hurting bad right now... hurting as much as you. Maybe more. [Echo of Dani] Hey! [Echo of Court] Hey yourself! You ready? Just hold on, ok? go! [Sobbing] It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. Dani: Maureen... is it always going to hurt this bad? Mama says it won't. I hope she's right. I hope so. You know... sometimes... I think that nothing's ever going to make sense again. Maybe life's not supposed to make sense. Doesn't that scare you? Yes, it does. I wish I could still talk to the man in the moon... don't you? It would be nice. Maureen? What? Will we always talk to each other? Always.
