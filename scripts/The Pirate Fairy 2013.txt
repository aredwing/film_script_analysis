A little bit of sun. Oh, look! Hey, Zarina! Oh. Out of pixie dust again, sug? You know me, Rosetta. I could give you some tips on conserving your supply. I may just take you up on that, Dessa. A Dust Keeper Fairy who's always out of pixie dust. Ironic, isn't it? Right there. Nice. Okay. Rinse time! Time to dry! Hey, Z! Wings okay? Just enjoying a stroll. But thanks, Fawn. Nice wind, Vidia. Thanks. What's a "stroll"? Oh, no! So I could be who I am Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm closer to where I'm meant to be If I try I know that I can get there I'm not gonna stop 'cause I believe That there's so much more to me So much more I wanna feel free to be who I am What I'm about is more than I've been Ready to show the world who I am Started it out, but I'm holding in Find my own place to stay So I can be who I am Uh... We put the dust in the bags and they stay there, right? And yet, we sprinkle dust on top of something, and it floats. Well, that's just how pixie dust works. Well, yes, I know, but "Why?" is the question. Know what I mean? Not even a little? Never once had the thought? Good morning, - Dust Keepers! - Oh! Good morning, Fairy Gary! All right, let's see. On blue dust duty today we have, uh... - What were we on? - "Y." Ah! Yes. Yvette. Yvette is out for the day, Fairy Gary. Dust-Keeper elbow flared up again. That's fantastic! I mean, poor, poor Yvette. Well, um, that brings us to... Zarina, you're up! Uh-oh. Can you believe it? I mean, one day early. It's so exciting! Uh... Six clicks to the right. Yes, thank you. - Wow. - Careful, now! After last time, I'm sure I don't have to remind you just how potent and powerful... - No touching, I promise. - Attagirl! All right, then. Exactly 26 specks. But why 26? - And here we go. - Why not 25? What would happen if we put in, say, 27? - We put in 26. - But why? Ah, Zarina, you're the most inquisitive fairy I've ever known. Correction, it's a tie. Let's just say, you're the Tinker Bell of Dust Keepers. But why do you say it like it's a bad thing? Because we don't work with twigs and acorn caps. We work with pixie dust. It's our lifeblood. There's no room for error. Blue dust. One of nature's mightiest multipliers. It takes the golden dust from a trickle to a roar. No matter how many times I see it, just... Wow! Indeed. Okay, but if there's blue dust, why can't there be other colors? Because there aren't. And maybe those other colors do other things. What if there was, I don't know, purple? What if there's pink? The day someone finds pink pixie dust is the day I trade in my kilt for trousers. Well, what if we don't find it? What if we make it? Listen carefully, Zarina. We do not tamper with pixie dust. It is far too powerful. But if we don't, we'll never fully understand what it's capable of. That is not our job. We're Dust Keepers. We nurture the dust, maintain it, measure it, package it, and distribute it. A beautiful tradition, day in, day out, passed from one generation... - ...to the next, to the next, to the next. - Oh! - Oh! Ahh! - Oh, no! Fairy Gary! Are you okay? Technically, I didn't touch it this time. The cap? Let me be absolutely clear, Zarina. Dust Keepers are forbidden to tamper with pixie dust. Hmm. No result. No result. No result. No result. Ugh! Huh? Hmm. Two parts sunflower seed, a dash of moonflower. Huh. It worked! Oh! Hey, Zarina! - What brings you... - Tinker Bell... - ...here? - Remember how you were the first one to use lost things, and everyone thought you were kind of crazy? I believe Fairy Mary called them "junk." Exactly! But now, even she uses them and tinkering is better than ever. Well, that's nice of... And remember how you crossed the Winter border when you knew it wasn't allowed, but you just had to anyway? I like to think it was more of a grey area. - Good. Now, keep that in mind. - Whoa! You... You're bending light. You're bending light? But you're not a Light Fairy. You're a Dust Keeper. Amazing, right? Uh, but, how? Whoa! You found orange pixie dust? No, Tink. I made orange pixie dust. That's never been done before. Exactly! I knew you'd understand. Now, I can finally figure out everything pixie dust is capable of. Oh, what does Fairy Gary think about all this? Uh... - He doesn't exactly know. - What? He doesn't really think we should tamper with pixie dust. - Do you mind stirring? - Uh, okay. I guess he thinks it's just too powerful. - Oh! You can't stop. - Oh! Uh... Is that blue dust? You're doing this with blue dust? Yes, and it just takes the tiniest bit. Can you believe it? - Back up a little. - Uh... Huh. - Wow. - Purple pixie dust. Wind! Purple equals fast-flying talent! Huh. Uh... - Garden talent next! - Uh... - Zarina? - Pink pixie dust... Maybe you should, you know, slow down a bit. Five pieces of petal for every three drops of extract. - Uh, should it be bubbling like that? - Mmm-hmm. Two? This time you're adding two? Uh-huh. Zarina! Are you okay? Tinker Fairy Gary some trousers, because I just made pink pixie dust. Zarina, this seems kind of dangerous. Do you know what this means, Tink? I've finally found my "lost things." Dust-keeping will change forever! Zarina, I really think you should stop! What? Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no. Whoa! Look out! Huh? Oh, no! No! OW! Oh! Oh, no! Whoa! Huh? No... Hmm? Oh! How did this happen? Oh, no! What happened? - Tink, are you okay? - Oh, my. - Yeah. - Who grew these? I'm so sorry. I'll help rebuild the depot. I'll come in early, I'll stay late! You were told not to tamper with pixie dust. I think it's best if you don't come in at all. What are you saying? You are no longer a Dust Keeper. It's simply too dangerous. We'll start rebuilding in the morning, Queen Clarion. Welcome one, welcome all to the Four Seasons Festival! Tonight, every talent from every season will gather together to celebrate all the realms of Pixie Hollow. Wow! Can you believe it? Everyone in Pixie Hollow is here! It's so great to have the Winter Fairies join us. I'll say it is. It's enough to give you the vapors. Tinker Bell, don't you Tinkers ever stop tinkering? Can't seem to get this latch to open! It had better not stick like that for our grand finale. - Is it starting? - No, that's just Clank. The thing is pretty loud, eh, Bobble? Indeed, my bugling buddy. Sure makes me thirsty, though. It's starting! Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! Bobble... Oh, no! Already? Hold these! But the show just started! Ask them to wait! Hey, guys, I can't see! Oh! It's Periwinkle! - Beautiful. - Oh, look at that. Hi, Peri! That's my sister. All right! Oh, wow! - Yeah! - Yay! Go, fairies! R0, did you do those? That wasn't in rehearsal. Wasn't me. I never work with poppies. The pollen makes me sleepy. Wait. Is that... Zarina? - Zarina? - Hmm. She's back? What's with that wild hair? Oh, look at those flowers! Ooh! Spring must be next! That's my favorite. Oh, I hope Clanky doesn't miss it. Oh! - Wow! Oh! - Huh? Oh, lovely! Oh! - Guys, guys! We gotta hide! - Oh! Now, now, now! They've really outdone themselves this year. What a show. Whoo! Excuse me. Sorry. Yes, me again. Coming through. No, no, don't get up. Oh, sorry, I should have flown. - Thank you, Bobble. - What did I miss? Wake up! Wake up! Please! Anyone? Clank, help us! Down here! Clank! - In here! In the box! - Oh! Oh, oh... - Ms. Bell? - Help, we're stuck. Right. How does it open? Push the button! Thank you so much. You've got to see this. Oh, no. - Are they... - No. Goodness, no. They're in a deep sleep. For how long? At least a couple of days. Why would Zarina do this? Clank, did you see her? No, no. Yes, yes, I saw her flying towards the dust depot. The blue pixie dust. Ooh, this is bad. Uh, yeah. Without it, the tree can't make pixie dust. And if the tree can't make pixie dust... We can't fly. On! Can't... Can't fly... - Deep breaths. - Can't fly... - Okay. Okay. - That's it. Deep breaths. What could she want it for? I don't know. But we have to find her. Clank, stay here and watch over everyone. I'm on it. Especially the Winter Fairies. Make sure they get a steady stream of snow. Right! Right. The blue dust has a strong glow. If we can just spot it... There! Whoa, she's moving fast! Oh, sorry! Where is all this fog coming from? It's mist. We must be getting near the coast. We're losing her! Over there! Oh, my! Oh, no. It's... Pirates. Great, now there's pirates. Maybe they're nice pirates. Right. They must have captured her, forced her to take the dust. Well, we have to rescue her. But they're... Deep breaths. Deep breaths. - Okay. - Hmm. - Magnificent! - Quite right. A fine haul. We got their blue dust! Well, it's not theirs anymore. It is theirs no longer. I just said that, you daft potato muncher. Potato... They're holding her in the bottom of the boat. You've got a right wee brain, you know that? Still smart enough to know we got their dust! Let me just say that your plan worked perfectly, Captain. "Captain"? Here's to perfect plans. Ave! Perfect! Guess she doesn't need rescuing. But now the hair makes sense. What do we do now? Let's just get the dust and get out of here. A little bit of pillage, a little bit of plunder. Oh! Fairies! Ahh! Get her! Get her! Whoa! Got it. - Here! - She's getting away! They took the blue dust! Captain! Give me back that dust! Zarina, why are you doing this? Fawn! If you give it to me, I'll give you quarter. Quarter? I think we need all of it. "Quarter" means mercy! Ooh. This dust belongs to Pixie Hollow. You had your chance. Wake up. Tink, wake up. What happened? The last thing I remember was Zarina throwing that dust at us. Your dress. I know. Um... ls everyone all right? I guess so. I'm not. Look at my outfit! Orange is not my color. She's right. Listen, we have to get out of here and go after Zarina. Silvermist, can you part the... Shut it Off! Shut it Off! I didn't do anything. I just... Tink! Tink, could you stop not doing anything? It's okay, I got this. Whoa! Silvermist, are you okay? Whoa! That's weird. Here, let me help you. It's so bright! - Bright! - Fawn, I can't see! - What did you do? - I don't know. Ew, ew, ew, ew. Get them off. Get them off! Get them off! Get them off! Wait a minute. Do you realize what this means? Oh, my gosh! Zarina switched our heads! No. No, no, no. She switched our talents. - Excuse me? - What? I must be a Water Fairy now. Oh, so, that's why your dress is blue. And I guess you're a Fast-Flying Fairy. I'm a... I'm a Light Fairy. Ow. - Garden Fairy! - Oh. Looks like I'm an Animal Fairy now. Huh. Lucky me. No, no, no, it can't be. - You're a... - Don't say it. Tinker Bell, take these things back right now! Okay. Tinker. Guys, come on, we gotta get out of here. Well, you're the Water Fairy. Part the waters. Um, use both hands this time. Well, you don't see that every day. You guys better hurry! I can't hold it! Oops! Guys, are you... .okay? Yeah. Guys, I think I broke something. Whoa! Uh... Nice, little, harmless, sharp-toothed, hungry croco... dile. Fawn! It's okay. When babies are born, they imprint on the first thing they see. Uh, guys, sorry to interrupt whatever that is, but the pirate ship is gone. - What? - Oh, no. Sil, Fast Flyer, check it out. Oh, yeah. Where is she? You guys, I saw it, up the coast! Let's go! Oh, right, you can't fly. Wet wings. Still, there's got to be a way to... Ah! Excuse me, Ro. Hmm. Structurally sound enough. Strength-to-weight ratio seems good. If I had some rope... Oh! You're thinking like a Tinker. Okay, fine. Get me some vines. Not a problem. Will these do? Okay, ready? Wait for me! Sorry. Gotta... Can I please have that? - Oh! Go! There's the pirate ship! You can slow down now! Easy for you to say. Hold on! Well, at least our wings are dry. Yeah. Twenty-one gun salute to the captain! Right, 21. - Nice boom! - Oh, yes! Nice! Ohh! Music to my ear! That's right! Encore! Beautiful! Yes, yes, yes! Cease fire! What? Cease fire? What for? That was only seven. I say 21. Right! Twenty-one, obviously, on the metric system, which is fine. Come on, we've got to find that dust. If I may, good sirs, I believe the proper acknowledgment would be a toast. A toast it is! Now, there is a good cabin boy. A beautiful suggestion. - Quite thirsty, myself. - Uh-uh! If it pleases the captain. You tell those scurvy scallywags that... What did she say? She said, it does! What is better than a good mug of grog? Two mugs! Your tea, Captain. Earl Grey, hot. Please, sir, may I have some more? To our cunning captain. Okay, you gotta love the boots. Just one year ago, we'd lost everything. Our ship turned adrift, and then we found her. Exactly. We needed a captain. And when we humbly asked if she could make us fly... She didn't stop there. No! She did one better, she did. Better indeed! Soon, she's going to make the whole ship fly! To flying! Fly? First the Tower of London, arr! The guards won't know what hit it We'll swoop right down and take the crown And the Crown Jewels with it And when we fly to Paris Oh, the treasures I'll be grabbin' The Mona Lisa will look lovely Hanging in me cabin Hey-ho Imagine the places that we'll go No one can stop us When we're so High in the stratosphere! Hey-ho We'll be the freighter that plunders Every one of the world's seven wonders When we're up in the skies For who can fight a frigate that flies? No one can fight a frigate that flies Next we'll roam to Rome, me lads And here's what I'll be stealin' I'll rob the Sistine Chapel Of the Sistine Chapel's cieilin' And for all the folks in Egypt It will be a dismal day They'll be crying for their mummies When we take their mummies away! Hey-ho Imagine the places that we'll go No can stop us when we're so high! They will all cower in fear Hey-ho, from Delhi to Rio to Venice There's no city that we will not menace When we're up in the skies For who can fight a frigate that flies? No one can fight a frigate that flies - Oh, how high we will be! - We will be 'Cause the blue fairy dust Surely packs a mighty wallop Only takes a dollop - Soon it will set us free - We'll be free From the chains of gravity Then we'll hoist up the sail And we'll set course for the sun 'Cause when you've got wings No wicked deed cannot be done And we owe it all To our great and glorious captain Although, now that you mention it, why are we taking orders from some fairy, anyway? Heh, heh, heh... Two, three, four! Hey-ho, imagine the places that we'll go No one can stop us when we're so high - Givin' a pirate cheer Arr! Hey-ho, we'll be the freighter that plunders Every one of the world's seven wonders When we're up in the skies For who can fight a frigate that flies? Hey-ho, there's not a town or a county That will not yield its bounty up When our ship draws near Hey-ho, there's not a city or village That we will not plunder or pillage When we're up in the skies For who can fight a frigate that flies? And every nation will give a donation When they see us sail the skies In a frigate that flies! Hey! Ah! - Whoa. - Tink. It looks like... The Pixie Dust Tree back home. Zarina must have grown it. So, that's how they're going to fly. She's going to make pixie dust. Ahoy, you biscuit-eating bilge rats! Prepare to dock starboard! Docking starboard! Captain says, raise the sails and step lively! Raise the sails! Heave! Bring her around, Mr. Yang! Bringing her around! - Let go anchor! - Let go anchor! - Get out all lines! - Get out all lines! Casting lines! - Come on, get moving. - Are you talking to me? Captain says, restock the ship. We set sail at dawn. Yes, Captain. Load ship, right away. Hey, watch where you're swinging that thing! Work faster, now! That's it! Come on. Locked. Come on, you lubber, get on with it. Someone's coming! Pirate! Hide! Animal Fairy, you're up. Excuse me, mouse. Uh... Mr. Mouse. Would you mind terribly moving on? We need this space to do a little hiding. Oh! Much obliged. Bye-bye! Aw, what a cute little mouse. It was a rat. Ew! Hey, shoo, rat! Uh, permission to enter, Captain. This is our chance. Now! No! I had Oppenheimer make you your favorite. The dust. I know how much you like a little something sweet while you work. Well, you're quite welcome. Hmm? Oh, uh... Uh, yes, of course. Sorry. Ah, right, second drawer. Look at that. It sparkles like a thousand sapphires. You're quite the little genius. It's hard to believe the other fairies didn't appreciate your talent. - Sil? - She looks seasick. This never happened when I was a Water Fairy. You know, I remember when I couldn't - understand a single jingle. - Oh, no! Huh? I'm fine. Fawn! - Sorry! - What are you doing? - What Dess does. - That's not what I do. Well, stop it! You shouldn't take light so lightly. - What? - What, what? What? No, nothing, nothing! Ooh. It's still so hard to believe that this blue dust can make flying dust. Yes, but only if you... Ah! So, the secret is the infusion of the blue dust directly into the tree. You okay? Start throwing out the line. All right, Tink, open the drawer as much as you can. So, once the golden dust has been produced... Sil, hold the line. The sluice will coat the ship with the perfect amount, and at that point, we take to the skies! Very impressive, Captain. No pirate I know could have imagined such a scheme. Whoa! Ahh! - Oh. - Vidia! You've turned out to be quite the pint-sized prodigy, if I may say. It's been an adventure and an honor. Your sword, Captain. Hmm. Y'all okay? Yeah. They're headed for the tree. Come on! Whoa! What is up with your... Hey, hey, we should catch up with Tink. Shh. All right, just give me the strap. That's it, hold it in place. Right, watch the angle of the flume. Too much pitch, and she'll overflow. Aye aye, Captain! Make sure the seams are sealed. Captain doesn't want to lose a single grain of that precious dust. Oh, that golden dust. Dess! Quiet! Sorry. I barely touched it. Well, don't touch it at all. - Just hover. - Yeah, hover. All right, all right. As soon as she's gone, we'll grab the dust and get out of here. Maybe we should try and talk to her. Yeah, because that worked out so well back at the waterfall. Hey, shoo. Hey! Shoo, shoo! Hey, hey, hey... Go, go, go! Oh, no. No! No, no, no, no, no! Stop growing. Stop growing. Please, branch, no! We 9011 you! Did you really think by switching our talents, you could beat us? Looks that way. Got them! Zarina! Well done. Got them all in one swell foop, I did. Zarina, don't do this. Come back with us. Come back home. I'll never go back to Pixie Hollow. You don't belong here. This is exactly where I belong, Tink. We appreciate what she can do. We treasure it, actually. Put them below, and keep your eye on them. Oh, right. Maybe I'll use, uh, this one? While you still have it. Captain, are you all right? Captain says, back to work, gentlemen. All righty, mates, you heard him. And, right. Perfect fit. Welcome to your new cabin. Oh. Me stock is ready. - Oh, well, now, look at that. - Oh, lovely. Oh, that is good eating right there. Isn't it, Mum? "Yes, it is, darling." Oh, let me see. What shall I make tonight? Well, I've still got some lard and some old cabbage. Okay, we need a plan. Here we go. - Whoa! - Mmm. - Ah! - Oh! It worked! - Yes, she did it! - It worked! - it's working! - Pixie dust! Look at it! Amazing! We're going to fly! From a trickle to a roar. Fly like a happy bird! Cold gruel, with a little bit of sawdust. A dash of rodent, sauteed of course. Some carrots? No. Hey, where you think you're going, little fella? Now is our chance. Go, go, go, go! Come on, all together. I'm going as fast as I can! Oh, not today, my darlings. Would you be kind enough to hold this for me? Perfect. Anybody else got an idea? Absolutely astonishing. Just imagine, flying like a bird. Of course, you do that all the time. What's it like? How do you even steer? It's pretty simple, actually. Lean left. Lean right, fly right. Whoa, whoa, whoa... This is... Are you afraid? Hmm? Afraid? Lead on, Captain. Oh, I'm doing it. I'm... I'm flying! Look out, mates! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Look at him go. What's so funny? Whoa! Whoa, whoa... You can't fly like that. Put your legs together. Whoo! Oh! On. Just try to keep up. Whoo-hoo! Whoo. Ave ave, Captain! The lad is flying! It works! It really works. And pretty soon, we'll have enough dust to make the whole ship fly. Right, Zarina? And as long as we have the blue dust, we'll never run out of flying dust. - Right again? - Right again, James. Well, then, we won't need you anymore. Our plan worked perfectly. Fairies are such gullible creatures. Aren't they, lads? No match for an Eton education such as mine. He's a smart one, isn't he? The power of the pixie dust is finally ours. We've had enough kissing up to that pint-sized prima donna. No quarter for her. Let's make her walk a tiny little plank. - Yes, tiny! - A tiny plank! She can fly, you cretins. - Oh! - You know, he's right. That is why he is the captain. She'd just fly away. I get it. Mi capitan. What if we tie her wings together? There's no stopping us. We'll plunder every port in all the seven seas. Prepare to get under way, you scurvy scallywags. We've got a ship to fly. Ha. And as for you, you'll make a fine little nightlight. Swoggle me eyes. Now, there's a sight. Oh, don't feel foolish. I was just too clever for you. That's all. Ah! Yes. Now, you see, my little fairy, navigating the Never Seas is one thing. But to chart a course for the sky, not only do you need longitude and latitude, but you also need altitude. Hmm. Oh... Now, let's not be a sore loser. Once we're past the second star, the world will be my oyster. And I don't even like oysters. We'll be in and out of every port so fast, they won't even know what hit them. No, no, no. Nice try, but it's fairy-proof. Brilliant, right? Oppenheimer! That ticking is driving me mad! Right. It's just a clock, you know. Well, not to worry. Pretty soon, we'll be flying so high it'll make these high seas look downright low! - Crazy. - Like we have a choice. Come on, guys, we're gonna get out of this. Well, we wouldn't even be in it if our new Garden Fairy didn't grow branches willy-nilly! You're not saying this is my fault. Hmm. If the flower fits. How can I cook with all that infernal jingle-jangling? There's only one thing to do. Oh, much better. Don't you think, Mum? None of it would've happened if you would have come over to help me with the bee! Are you saying this is my fault? Well, if the rose fits. Let's not point fingers. It's Zarina's fault. - Guys? Guys? - Right, what about her? Yeah, let's talk about that. Guys, look! Great. Just what I need. Uh-uh-uh. Bad crocodile. Bad croc. I am not your mother! Wait. Rosetta, he can get us out of here. You're right. Good. Good crocodile. Come here. Come here, stocky. Come to Mama. Shh! Quiet. Okay. Now, pull us off the table. Come here. Come to Mama. That's right, sugar. What is going on here? A stowaway, is it? Oh, no! Oh, no, you don't. Hello. Hurry! Hurry! - Gotcha! - Rosetta! A little extra flavor. Ooh! Good job, crocky. You are such a good little boy. Yes, you are. What a good little widdle snuggle wuggums. That's his mama. Okay, enough. Let's get out of here. Wait, Vidia. We can't just race out there. They'll see us. Hmm. Make ready to sail! Aye aye, Captain! I love the life of a pirate. But I hate rats. Move it, Port. I'll move it in me own good time. Huh, see anything? Nope. All clear up here. Well, it's not clear down here. It stinks! I know, isn't it great? - Smells just like skunk. - Huh. Spoken like a true Animal Fairy. I Wish. All right, you guys. Remember, right arm, left foot. Got it? Aye aye. Sil, I'm right, you're left. - Right. - No, left. - I mean, left. - What? - And you're right. - Let's go. AYE aye! Big pole. Back, back, back. Forward, forward, forward. Hey, you swabs, work faster! Hey! Oppenheimer! Don't forget the kippers. And you, back to work. Ah, muy bien. Ah, we're gonna fly, mate! We're gonna fly! It's a do-si-do. I can't dance! Uh-Oh. Look out! Fly! Would you watch where I'm going? Go, go! Come on! - Hurry UP! - Okay. We got it! Return that blue dust! Or your friend is done for. That's right. Captain Zarina has been relieved of duty. Ha. You truly are a talented fairy. Prepare to cast off! Weigh anchor and get ready to fly, me hearties! Casting off! It's working! I can't believe my eye! Weigh anchor! We're flying! We're flying! It's perfect. We can fly! Oh, my! Up, up and away! Shiver me timbers, we're flying! Bon voyage, little captain. No! Come on, hurry! Hurry! Help! Please! Help! Help me! Here, I'll dry you off. We're flying! Are you okay? You saved me. Why? Let's just say, we're offering you quarter. I'm so sorry. They're headed for the second star. If they make it past we'll never find them. The blue dust will be gone forever. Then let's stop them before they get there. Captain. Port, Starboard, get up the mizzen and raise the royal. Aye aye, Captain! Raising the royal! More pixie dust! Who's in the mood to plunder? You guys turn the ship around. - I'm getting back that blue dust. - Right. Look alive, men! The second star, dead ahead. Nothing but smooth sailing. Huh? Yeah! Fairies! Fairies! It's the fairies! She's back? Well, get them off my ship. Gladly. It's actually quite amusing. Stand your ground, men! Yang, the helm! Ave ave, Captain! Ladies, until we meet again. - Great. - Ha. You dare to fight the captain, do you? Only until I get that dust. Well, this should be fun. Come here, you little cuties. Okay, this isn't working. Fawn, the spyglass! Brilliant! You tiny thing. No! Man overboard! I did it! Stop them, you imbeciles. They're six-inch fairies! Fawn, the wheel! Sil, whirlwind! Take that! Whoa, whoa... Blast it. The second star! They turned the ship around! Yup, we sure did. Get this ship back on course! Aye aye, Captain! Now! Why you... Bull's-eye! No fair! Come back here! Fairies, fairies, nothing but fairies! Stop moving so fast. Ha-ha! Just one more, pirate. Jingle-jingle. Ha! Uh-oh! - Nice work. - Just thinking like a Tinker. No, no, no! Take that, you little... Oh, my! Avast, crocky! Charge! No! Get it away, get it away, get it away, get it away! Yeah, that's it. Don't make me use my teaspoon. Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't, you little... Oh! You ate my mummy's clock? What was wrong with the spatula? Sic him! Oh! That's my crocky. There's nothing I revel quite as much as a worthy opponent. You're stronger than you look. Hey, need some help? Anchor's away! Grow some seaweed, sunflower. Whoa! Ahh! Now, that's some seaweed! I've had just about enough of this. Ha! You, too! You're not going anywhere. These ought to fetch a hefty price, eh? Back on course. Give me that dust! No! The dust! Not my dust! No! I got the dust. Oh, you're okay. Oh, thank goodness. Let's get you out of there. Lean right, fly right. I'll take that! Now, where was I? Ah, yes. The second star. You simply don't give up. Well, I guess I'm stronger than I look. The second star. Oh... Zarina! You fought well, little fairy. But it's over. The dust is mine. The ship is mine. Your adventure has come to an end. Oh, go ahead, take it. What's one speck between friends? No, really, I think you should have it all! Huh? From a trickle to a roar. Whoa! We're free! Look at him go! He's very fast. Yeah, you think? Is it time to get that blue dust back? Watch this.
