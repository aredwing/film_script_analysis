We are going to have the best time here in Willows. [Both] Yay! Yay. I even made a summer fun list to make the most of the two-week visit. Whoa! That's a lot of fun. [GPS] Re-calculating route. Again. Barbie, according to my GPS, we should have turned back there to get to Grandma's house. Skipper, I don't need a GPS. I know my way around Willows like I know my way around Malibu. There it is, guys! [Barbie] The first tree. [Chelsea] The first tree ever? The first willow tree in Willows. [Barbie] The town's founding fathers brought a willow tree twig with them, and all the other willows here came from it. You sure know a lot about Willows. And twigs. Oh, I learned all of that back when I was a Willows tour guide. Ahem. If you look to your left, you'll see Town Square. [GPS] Re-calculating. Re-calculating. [Barbie] Oh! There's McKinley's Ice Cream Shop, where I was Junior Scooper of the Month nine months in a row. The clock tower where I was voted Most Melodic Bell Ringer. [bells chiming] And over there is city hall. Let me guess, you worked there too? Hm. She was Mini-Mayor when she was four. It was purely ceremonial. Except when I declared ponytails the official hairstyle of Willows. Are we gonna spend the whole vacation on the Barbie Memorial Tour? [gasps] The playground! [Stacie] It has the coolest giant pirate ship! [chuckles] Stacie thought it was a real pirate ship. Give me a break, Skipper. I was four. Ooh, there's a bench! What? I thought we were just pointing stuff out. Don't you remember anything about Willows? Chelsea was just a baby when we moved to Malibu. [sighs] I'm sure I'll remember something. [Barbie, Skipper, Stacie] Willowfest! [giggling] Willowfest! Whoo! Where are we again, Joe? Wisconsin. Oh, yeah. Well, they all start to look the same after a while. All we do is set up... [grunts] break down. Set up... [grunts] break down. Don't worry, Marty. Our luck's gotta change soon. [grunts] Ah! Can't you do anything right? -Sorry, boss! -[grunts] Our old house! Just as I remembered. Perfect. [car horn honks] Tiffany, our esteemed guests have arrived. [gasps] There's Grandma! [GPS] You have reached your destination. Finally. [All] Grandma! Girls! You've all gotten so big. I hardly recognize you. Grandma, it's not like you haven't seen us. We just e-chatted last week. That may be, but you can't have an e-hug. Get over here. Oh! Girls, I have a surprise for you. I love, love, love surprises! Go on, they're inside. -Oh, that's cool. Come on! -Oh, I wonder what it is. They? [gasps] Cupcakes! You shouldn't have. [barking] Look under the cupcakes. [barking] Yay! Puppies! -[Barbie] Oh! Aren't they sweet? -[Chelsea] Aw! They're Tiffany's girls. Oh, they're so cute! What are their names? I don't know. Why don't you decide? Mama, these girls are so cute! Is this our surprise? Yes, girls. You're finally going to get your names. [barking] [giggles] I'm gonna call you Honey. [sniffing] Can I keep her? [chuckles] Wow. Nailed the dismount. That's some moves, Rookie. Hear that? I'm Rookie. [sniffing] [giggles] Do you want to listen to some tunes, little-- um... DJ? DJ? [music plays in headphones] Oh, yeah! That's my jam. [barking, singing] [laughs] A little pitchy, but you've got rhythm. [kisses] Come here, girl. Don't you want to go and meet Barbie? What if she doesn't like me? Tiffany: How could she not like you? Go on. Hello, there. Oh! You're adorable. What's your name? Pup-a-doodle-doo? Salt 'n' Puppa? Cute-asaurus Rex? No, that's not right. Well, we'll think of a name for you later. I'm gonna call Christie. Gotta make plans for Willowfest. Riding all the rides with her is number one on my summer fun list. Whoa! I don't think she's gonna let you go without her. Yeah, she's stuck to you. [giggles] Like taffy. What do you think of that? Aw, that's a cute name. Don't worry, yours is cuter. Come on, Taffy. I can't wait to see you. Yes, I'll meet you at the ticket booth. You know it. -Okay, you too. -[knocking] [giggling] No, you hang up first. This is your old room? [gasps] I didn't know you were a rodeo clown! Just one summer. Those bulls mean business. Chelsea? You'll be staying in Skipper and Stacie's old room across the hall. [giggling] My bed is still the bounciest. Bounce, bounce, flip, bounce. Mine still has the best view. What's that? Chipmunk? An old shoe? Bacon? How come I don't have a princess bed? Or any photos? Last time we lived here, you slept in a crib. I bet you can still fit. [sighs] You know, there might be something of yours upstairs in the attic. Let's investigate. [gasps] Whoa! Chelsea, this was your crib. See, Skipper? I'm way too big to fit. [gasps] Whoa! Have you been, like, everywhere? [chuckles] Your grandfather and I always loved a good adventure. Whoa! Is this a pirate spyglass? We got that in Morocco. Hey, Stacie, over here! What? [both giggling] Cool! Oh! [sighs] [sniffing] Whoa! Hide and go seek. Honey, you're it. One, nine, four, eleven, uh... ten, four... This smells like Barbie. one! Ready or not, here I come! Aw, how do you always find me? Okay, new game. I'm it. No pounce-backs. Aw. [ragtime music plays] Oh, whoa! [music stops] [Taffy squealing] It's dark in here. Let me out! Whew, thanks. You're welcome. And you're it. Is this me? [Barbie] Taffy! Taffy? There you are. I was looking for you. [gasps] My summer box. I can't believe you still have it. I kept all my summer keepsakes in here. Hey, my Junior Scooper scoop. [gasps] My Junior Mayoral sash. Aw, my Willowfest ribbons. Whoa, Grandpa's notebook. [Taffy barks] Wow! I almost forgot about that. Hm. What is it? It's my treasure map. [All] What? [Grandma] Legend has it a treasure was buried right here in Willows by the town founders. They wanted to make sure Willows would always prosper, and the treasure would be there in a time of need. It is said that they hid clues to its location throughout the town for future generations to find. No way! Yes, way. Every summer, Grandpa and I would look for clues together. Does everyone in Willows know about the treasure? Oh, over the years people have forgotten about it. Most now just believe it's an old folktale. But Grandpa believed. So you never found it? No. After a while, we just gave up. I wonder what the treasure is. Diamonds? Jewels? Gold doubloons? Smelly socks? Tennis balls? Bacon! No one knows for sure. With all that gold, I'd buy a skateboard park and put it inside a basketball court. Then I could double ollie right into an alley-oop. Let's go find it. Maybe you should start tomorrow, when it's daytime. Oh, right. Barbie, can you take us, please? Sorry, but I'm gonna hang out with Christie. Plus, my treasure hunting days are over. I'll go with. It'll be the perfect story of adventure and defeat for my blog. Don't you think we'll find it? You can take my map if you want. No need for the hard copy. This treasure hunt just went hi-tech. Oh, I can't wait for tomorrow. Where do we start? Well, according to the legend, the treasure hunt begins where the town began. Our first clue! This is gonna be awesome! [chirping] Sorry, Chelsea. I know, I know. I didn't have a bike when we used to live here either. Flashlight, notebook, pencil, magnifying glasses. You know, they have apps for all those. [gasps] I almost forgot the cupcakes. Whoa! Don't forget your lunches! I made salmon mousse sandwiches with a hint of mint. I was thinking more peanut butter with a hint of jelly. I could whip you up some of those, too. Puppy platoon, move out! Heads and tails down! Pup, two, three, four. Pup, two, three, four. Pup, two, three, four. -This is fun. -The grass tickles. Now, now, now! Don't get your collar all up in a bunch. Maybe we should just wait here until they get home. And let them have all the fun? Scaredy-dog! Am not! Hurry up! Come on, Taffy! Hurry, hurry, hurry! [grunts] [Grandma] Have fun, girls. Just make sure you're back in time for dinner. [All] We will! [grunts] These cupcakes are heavier than I thought. [children chattering] [panting] [gasps] Wasn't me! It's okay, Chelsea. The bike rack must just be old. I'll meet you guys back here at 5:00 and we'll ride back home together. Okay. Say hi to Christie. Will do. And good luck. We don't need luck, we've got tech. Grandma said the search begins where the town began. City hall is where the town was founded. All right! Let the treasure hunt begin. I knew it. Huh? Knew what? I've heard about the Willows treasure for years. Huh? Treasure? Joe, we could put air-conditioning in all the tents. We could do more than that! A treasure would be our ticket out of this stinking carnival. And have our very own air-conditioned tent. We best better keep an eye on them there girls and see what they find out. Ah! -Oh, oh! -Sorry, Joe! You said to keep an eye on the girls, and then I only had one left for the hammering. [grunts] Where did the girls go? They went left. No, south. No, motorcycle. I don't know my directions! They're over there! Everybody move out! Formation! But Barbie's not with them. I'll go find her. Actually, it's nicer in here. [Skipper] "The town of Willows is dedicated to all those with an adventurous spirit." That's us! Say "treasure!" Uploading to the blog. Well, hiya! How can I help you girls? Do you know where the treasure is? [chuckles] Treasure? You don't believe in that silly old legend, do you? It's not silly! My grandpa believed in the treasure. Oh, you must be the Roberts! I knew your granddaddy back when we were young'ns. -I'm Mayor Jenkins. -[cement shifting] Whoa! Oh, how embarrassing. Someone's gonna get hurt on that step. [sighs] I suppose Willows could use a hidden treasure these days. Just between you, me, and the fence post, Old Jack here knows this town better than anyone. Maybe he can help you with your treasure's whereabouts, eh, Jack? [chuckles] [barking] [Stacie gasps] The puppies! What? Did they follow us all the way from Grandma's? Can they come along? I bet they're really good at sniffing out clues. As long as they don't get into trouble. [DJ, Honey] We won't. Well, I might. Okay, let's get back to work. "Let the willows be your guide. Seek and you shall find." The willow emblems! They're the guide to our next clues! Okay, everybody split up and look for anything that has a willow symbol on it. [barking] We'd like to ask a few questions about this treasure. -Do you know its position? -Do you know what the treasure is? -How old are you? -Have you seen the treasure? Are you understanding any of these words? [grunts] [carnival music plays] [gasps] Christie! Barbie! Wow! It's so good to see you. How long has it been? It doesn't seem like that long. But it must be long because we were both kids, and now you live in Malibu in an awesome house by the beach, but you totally know that. [gasps] My bestie who lives out westie. [giggles] Do you still remember our secret friendshake? Only 100% yes! [Both] Besties forever! So are you ready for the first Willowfest ride? [Both] The Storminator! There's no one in line. We can totally skate right up to the front. -Well, not that we actually have skates. -Hey... It's closed for repairs! What? That's not Willowfest, that's Bummerfest. Aw. Well, I guess we can start a new tradition. Nothing over here! I don't see anything either! My search of the online town history for hidden willow emblems isn't showing any hits. Surprise, surprise. See anything, Honey? Not yet! How about you, Rookie? Nope! Nothing! Why are we yelling? I don't know! [grunts] What's an old town dog gotta do to get a nap around here? Hey, Jack. Whoa! Did that dog just... Nah, can't be. Right? [Stacie] "We came from afar to this great land carrying the future in the palm of our hand." Ooh! Ooh! I know! They carried their suitcases! I don't know, Chels. What did Barbie say about the twig? There. The founders brought the twig with them in this vase. Hmm. Where's that vase now? In there! Our next clue! -Bye, Jack! -Smell you later! It's ruff in the treasure trenches. We could use a dog like you. Yeah, sure. I'll be right there. You go first [sighs] You do this Okay, here it goes. [carnival music plays] Barbie! Oh, aren't you a cute little boy! [screams] [Joe] Today is your lucky day, sport! Knock down the bottles and win a prize! Yeah, like a customer ever wins a prize. Zip it! [Boy] Oh, so close. Would you like to try again? It's how we get your money-- [grunts] [grunts] I won! I won! Now we've gotta pay for that giant banana out of our paycheck! Get that dog! [both grunting] -Now wait a second! -No! Get back here you! I'm coming after you! Where's my giant banana? Come back here! I'm gonna get you! [grunts] Marty, get me outta here! Oowee, you're gonna have to eat your way out, boss! Barbie? Where are you? Remember that time you, me, and Midge each ate a whole bag of kettle corn and then went on the Whirly Swing Ride? They should've called it the Hurly Swing Ride! Yuck! Midge still won't eat any corn of any kind. Hey, where is that ride? -Did we pass it? -Not here. They didn't bring as many rides this year. What a bummer, 'cause everyone really loves all the rides, but the town didn't have enough money for the total fest, so they just brought some of the fest, but it's still a fest and still Willows, I guess. Hey, I think the bumper cars are around here somewhere. Cool. Let's do that. -We can still bump with the rest of them. -[Taffy barking] Taffy? How did you get here? [whistles] -[whines] -It's okay, girl. I've got you. Oh, Taffy, you're covered in... taffy. Good thing I didn't name you Mud. Mm! Taffy! Mm! [Stacie] There it is. Okay, let's ask if we can get a closer look. All righty, I'll give you girls just five minutes, then I've got to skedaddle off to the bingo. [All] Thank you! [Chelsea] Do you see any clues? It looks like something's written on this inside, but I can't make it out. "Snurs... selim? Reven"? Whatcha lookin' for? I think I have a mirror in here. You can do your makeup later. Not for me, for the clue. It's written backwards. I wanna see! Careful! Huh. Nice grab. Whew. Uh-oh. This is loose. Wasn't me! Hey, is that a willow symbol? [Skipper] It looks like a button. Should I push it? I'm gonna push it. [gasps] What is it? I'm not sure. In case we need it for the treasure. Isn't that stealing? I'm just borrowing it. I'll give it back when we find the treasure. You're forgetting about the clue -Want my mirror? -No need. I'll just reverse the image. There. "What runs for miles never gets tired." -It's a riddle. -Okay, girls. Time's up. Bingo's awaiting. We should get home for dinner anyway. Whatever Grandma's making is gonna be fancy and weird, but delicious Oh, that's the girls! They found another clue on their treasure hunt and are heading home. Hm. They're making faster progress that I thought. Wouldn't that be totally awesome if they found a treasure? I mean, there's no such thing as the Willows treasure. But who wouldn't love a treasure? Yeah, that would be something. No harm in looking. I guess we'd better head home too. Wanna hang again tomorrow? Aw, sorry, I've gotta help my mom pack. Wait, where are you going? I just got here! Not that kind of pack. My dad lost his job. End of the summer, we're moving to go live with my aunt and uncle. My dad says it's a good thing. I'm not so sure. Oh, Christie. I didn't know. Is there anything I can do? Oh, no thanks, Barbie. It'll be fine. Change is good, right? Sure. Yeah! Right! How about an ice cream sundae? My treat. You know me so well! That sounds perfect. Race you to McKinley's! [laughter, barking] I caught one! Ooh! It's pretty! Look at them! [gasps] Catching fireflies in the backyard. Check. So, girls, what mysteries did you uncover today? We found two clues and this! Whatever it is. Where did you find that? -Hidden in a vase. -The vase! Huh. I must've missed that. That's a noteworthy start for your first day of adventure. Oh, your grandfather would be proud. And, Barbie, how was your day with Christie? Okay, I guess. There weren't as many rides at Willowfest. Willowfest has gotten smaller over the years. The mayor even thought about canceling it altogether. As it is, this one might be the last. -What? -No more Willowfest? Aw, I was just starting to remember it. You just can't have summer without Willowfest. Now, I won't stand for those sour faces. You know, I might have something to cheer you up. What is that? Home movies. On tapes? Back in the Stone Ages before digital, we recorded video on these. -Am I one there? -[Grandma] Maybe. You were a baby then. [snickers] Do the lights have to be all the way off? Shh! Down in front, please! -I love movies! -[dance music plays] No talking. Turn off your electronic devices... DJ. -All right, all right. Chill. -[music stops] [Barbie] My first Willowfest competition. You built a rocket when you were 11? They wouldn't let me enter when I was ten. That kind with the tiny volcano experiment never stood a chance. There I am! Wake up, baby me! [Stacie] Chelsea, we can't see! Christie, put that down and get on! -Wow! -[Christie] Hey, you're leaving without me! [gasps] I think I just saw my foot! [Chelsea] Oh, it's a doll. Voil! Corn dog la Martin. Again? Doesn't matter how you garnish 'em, -it's still day-old corn dogs. -[sniffs] Ew. I think these might be two days old. When we get that treasure, we's gonna have a feast every night. Oh, that sounds yummy, boss! Corn dog chili, sweet and sour corn dog... corn dog kabobs, corn dog sushi... corn dog la mode... No, real food like steak and salad! Ooh, corn dog salad. Ugh. But how are we gonna find the treasure, Joe? Maybe we don't find it. Huh? Maybe we let them girls do all the work and find the clues. They'll lead us right to the treasure. Then we grabs it! Sorry, Joe. That there garnish has gone bad. Thank you! -[Stacie] See you tonight! You all behave now! Listen to the girls! We will, Mama! This is awesome! [Barbie] It's just you and me, Taffy. I'm so excited to show you all my old fave places. Number 26 on my summer fun list-- Sit in on a dance class with Ms. Melody. I can't wait to see her. [gasps] Closed? Oh, no. I can't believe it. Poor Ms. Melody. I hope she's okay. [sighs] It doesn't look like I'm ever gonna finish this list. You're right, Taffy. There are still a few things we can do on this list. Okay, girls, let's go find the treasure. -Morning, Jack! -Hiya! -What's up? -Wanna come with us today? We're on a treasure hunt. Don't you kids got your own tails to chase? Skipper, can you read us back the last clue? "What runs for miles never gets tired." Me! I can run and run and never get tired! I don't think you're the answer to the riddle. Why not? What's it mean? It's a riddle. You have to figure it out. Hm, who wouldn't get tired of running? Not a who... Hm, let's see. There's running out of time, running start... -running the show... -Running water! [gasps] Are you thinking what I'm thinking? [Skipper, Stacie] Willows Fountain! Uh... yeah! Sure. Willows Fountain! I was just about to say that! [Joe] Well, lookie down there! Do... do I have to? Looks like those girls are on to another clue Hm... Where are they goin'? [shrieks] -Mama! -Get-- get off me! [Both] Whoa, whoa. whoa! The next clue has got to be here somewhere. "Where the water flows, the willow grows." Hey, up there! There's one of those trees! Look! There's another willow emblem on the top tier! Maybe hitting it will reveal another clue. Good eye, Stacie. I helped How do we get up there? Hm... Here, use this. This will be great practice for the midway games at Willowfest. Aw, man. I blew it. If you miss again, you're gonna owe me 50 cents. She shoots, she scores! "Slowly progressing like a midday chime, the growth of a tree is a reflection of time." Time? Look! It's the clock tower! [Stacie] The clue said midday chime. It's almost noon. Let's hurry! Whoa, how'd they get that fountain to do that? You got a coin? I wish for a treasure. [growls] Got another coin? What do you think, I'm made of money? -Go get that one back! -[splashing] I'll get it this time for sure, Joe. [grunts] Knock it off! We don't need the clue! Just follow the girls! Oh, good idea, Joe! [wails] Is it noon yet? Almost. In five... four... -Seven... -Eleventy... -Motorcycle... -One! [bells chiming] What are we looking for? I don't know! [chiming simple melody] Clock dogs! Wait, was that it? I guess so. What do we do now? We're gonna have to come back tomorrow and try again. We're sure to figure it out then. Treasure hunting is hard work. -[sniffs] -[sizzling] [yelps] [sighs] [sighs] Are you sure there's even a clue here? I'm sure we're in the right place. There's got to be something we're missing. [humming simple melody] Why are you humming that song? 'Cause I don't know the words. [humming simple melody] Chelsea, why do you keep humming that song? Because I don't know the words. That's it! What's it? We've been so busy looking for clues, maybe we should be listening for the clue. [humming simple melody] [beeps] It doesn't sound like any song I've ever heard. My music app will match the notes of the chime with any known song. There's probably a million songs! -That'll take all-- -[app beeps] -Got it. -Oh. The song is called "Beneath the Willow Tree." And it's the town song! And listen to these lyrics! Everything you need lies beneath the willow tree But there's tons of willow trees around here! But there's only one first tree! Last one there is a rotten egg! Whew! Goodbye, clock tower. That song was making me cuckoo. Everything you need lies beneath the willow tree Those girls are gettin' close to somethin'. I smells treasure. I just smell corn dogs. [sniffs] Nope, that's me. [beeping] I downloaded a metal detector app. It should help us find where the treasure is hidden. You know what we need? A treasure app! -[loud beep] -The treasure! Let's see what we've got. I can dig the fastest! Hey, not cool. Oopsie. Sorry. Look! Something shiny! A gum wrapper. Keep looking! Great stuff, girls! This is perfect for my blog. Are you gonna help or what? Day ten. The intrepid treasure hunters work their fingers raw... Another nickel? Great. Now we have 35 cents. There's your treasure. ...as they claw through the cold, unforgiving dirt, unaware of the utter futility of their quest. -What? -There is a treasure! Grandpa wouldn't have spent his life searching for it. We just have to keep looking. [yawns] We've been at this forever. Let's just go home for the day. We're so close! We've already found the vase and fountain and even figured out the song! And we don't even know where this goes. We're all tired. The treasure's been hidden for over 100 years. It'll still be there tomorrow. [gasps] My backpack's gone! -Wasn't me! -[barking] Hurry up, Marty! They're gaining! Sorry, kid. We need this. [sobbing] Have a cupcake! [screams] [gasps] [both grunting] I'll just be waiting here! [screams [gasps] They're gone! stolen backpack, but so far no word back. All my downloads, my games, my apps... [gasps] My selfies! My whole life was on that tablet You should always backup! That's what I always say. And it had all our clues on it! All you're worried about is that dumb treasure hunt? I can't even text! -But we have to-- -Look, the hunt is over for the summer. I'm sorry, Stacie. Skipper's right. You got really close. Closer than I ever did. Maybe that's the reason no one ever found it was because they all gave up! I'm not giving up. [snoring] [Grandma] The girls are asleep. Just wanted to see if you needed anything. Thanks, I'm good. Grandma, the town's in trouble, isn't it? Everything seems run down. Willowfest is almost canceled. Christie's family is moving away. The town's been through good times and bad, but I think everyone could use a little good news about now. Like finding treasure? [sighs] I wish Grandpa and I had found it. Then the town wouldn't be in trouble now. He always loved a good adventure. You know, your grandfather said that best part of an adventure was sharing it with the people you love. I've been so busy with my list, I haven't spent much time at all with my sisters. There's still time. Grandma, do you really believe there's a treasure? It may be the only way to save Willows. Your grandfather believed. That's good enough for me. They're diggin'. They must be close. Let's see what else they found out. [chews loudly] You know what this here needs? Don't you dare say "corn dog." Well, it does. What did you say? Uh, nothin'. I'm going out to find the treasure. Who's with me? Even if we did want to keep going on the treasure hunt, we don't have any of our clues! They were all in my tablet! Whoever took it didn't get this. Or this. [gasps] Your old treasure map? Always have a backup. That's what I said I always say. You're gonna help us find the treasure? Grandpa always said the best part of an adventure was sharing it with people you love. [Stacie] We all ended up at the first willow tree, but we didn't find anything buried under the tree. "Everything you need lies beneath the willow tree." Beneath. Maybe we didn't dig down far enough. [Stacie] Maybe it's way below. Like under the town? Here's where we stopped. Beneath the first tree. The song lead us there. Hm... What about the second verse? -There's a second verse? -Yeah, there's a second verse. I learned it when I was Mini-Mayor. But my search only brought the one verse. You mean you can't trust everything on the Internet? "Meet me there at 3:00 by the shady willow tree." [gasps] The shady willow tree! Come with me! Am I the only one lost here? Nope. I'm kinda lost. -Me too. -Me three. [Barbie] There it is. Not beneath the willow tree. The second verse says "the shady tree," or the shadow! That's why you never found anything. You were looking in the wrong place! We need to look here. [grunts] Finally some peace and quiet. [bicycles approaching] [barking] [grumbles] "Meet me there at 3:00 by the shady willow tree." It's almost 3:00 now. It's gotta be here somewhere. [chiming] [chiming simple melody] Look. The sun is reflecting off the clock tower. Hey, I think I found something! Great. What is it? Is it a clue? It's the willows emblem! But it's out of order. It's like a puzzle. Move over. Puzzles are my thing. -Nailed it. -Nice. [All gasp] [All] Whoa. You really think we're gonna need all this? Always best to accessorize for any occasion. All right, let's do this! Oh, well, what do you know? Whoa, it's really cave-y in here. The things I do for my blog. [grunts] Hey Joe, don't you think they're gonna notice we're away from the carnival all this time? None of that's gonna matter when we finds the treasure. Well, where should we start? Ow! Drop everything. [screams] Joe! I just did what you told! [echoes] Wow. [echoing barks] [Chelsea] Um... Are we really gonna cross that? Come on, girls. No one else has made it this far before! We can do this. Okay, everybody stick together. I'm sticking! [creaking] This isn't so hard. Ah! Oh, no! [All] Skipper! Skipper! Are you okay? I'm okay. Thanks, DJ. We're almost across. Just a few more steps. [grunts] Okay, girls. Let's go. Oh, it's really dark in here. And high. And dark. -[bats shrieking] -And-- and batty! Bat ain't good. Let go of me! Sorry, Joe. Hey, those dogs look like us. [bats shrieking] Whoa! Guess the only way is down. That's far enough, girls. I think we've got it from here. It's those mean guys from the carnival! Hey! I know you! You stole my backpack! You mean "allegedly stole." Yeah, and even if we did, what are you gonna do about it? Hey! Where are you goin'? [Joe] Don't you go and try any funny business. That treasure's mine! Ours, right? Sharesies? Well, guys, I guess you got us. [Barbie] Not much left to do than let you take the treasure. Ha! "Let us"? We's gonna take that treasure no matter what.

We could doggy paddle. Hey, what's this rope for? [grunts] Let me help. Why are we pulling this anyway? [all scream] Whoa. Hurry! Get on! There they are! Row, row, row your boat Gently to the treasure -Gah! - Merrily, merrily, merrily Row, row, row your boat Gently down the stream [grunts] Well, lookie here... rls, put these on.

I wish Grandpa could have seen this. Hm. I kinda wish it was chocolate. Cool! -Score! -Ooh. Pretty. [sloshy footsteps] -Necklaces! Bracelets! -Tiaras! [Joe] Well, thanks for handling all the hard stuff, girls. I don't know, Joe. Those rapids were no day at the park. [barking] We found the treasure fair and square. Actually, this treasure belongs to the city. -Oh, it does? -It does? -It does. -Who's gonna stop us? Four little girls and their little doggies? Who you calling little" Ooh-hoo-hoo. Ho-ho! [laughs] Look at that! -[grunts] -[rumbling] Be careful with that! [grunts] It wasn't me! What did you do? Me? I didn't do nothin'... this time. -[gasps] -[barks] Taffy! Barbie? Oh Mama! Oh Mama! Oh Mama! Oh Mama! Get off me! [wails] -[growling] -Nice p-puppies. There's got to be a way out. There's got to be a way in. [sniffs] [grunts] Barbie? Honey? DJ? [barks] [whimpers] Hey, boss, I don't like it in here. What are you doin'? I hope Taffy's all right. [gasps] I am not a scaredy-dog. I am not a scaredy-dog. [grunts] Ah! [grunts] Wahoo!

Puppies one, bad guys zero. [barking] Look! [Barbie] Way to go, Taffy! Look! She found a way out! I would like to honor the Roberts family. Barbie, Skipper, Stacie, and Chelsea for their bravery and ingenuity in finding the lost treasure of Willows. [cheers and applause] [barking] Hey, what about us? Yeah, we helped too! And their puppies of course. [laugh] The gals have decided to donate the treasure to the city of Willows, which is the nicest thing I've ever heard. [cheers and applause] Their generous donation has saved the city, ensuring many more years of Willowfest! So as a token of our gratitude, we hope you will accept this finder's fee. It may not be the whole treasure, but it's yours, you know. Everybody knows that's my wagon, right? [laughs] Your grandfather would be so proud. So what should we do to celebrate? Next time I come to Grandma's, there will be lots of photos on the wall and lots of memories! Willowfest provides a glimpse in the past for future generations to come. I thought you got your tablet back, Skipper. I did, but I thought I'd write down a few notes old-school style to capture the feel of old-time Willows. Don't worry, I'll scan them all to my blog when we get home. [Christie] Barbie! Wow, you and your sisters totally found the lost treasure buried under the town of Willows! Can you believe it? Well, of course you can believe it 'cause you did it. And now there's gonna be all this new business renovating the town and my dad's got a new job and we don't have to move anymore! So yay! We can stay! I'm amazed she can say all of that in one breath. You know, there's one thing on my summer fun list we could still do together. [Both] The Storminator! I can't believe it's time to go back home tomorrow. I'm gonna miss you, Honey. You know, now that the puppies are getting bigger, I couldn't possibly take care of all of them. [gasps] Can we keep them? Of course. They're part of the family now. Yay! We're going to Malibu! -Wherever that is. -And we can swim in the ocean! Whatever that is. Are you sure you want to hide your share of the treasure? Yes. The founders knew the town needed to have something to believe in. Taffy and I planted all new clues around town. You guys made sure the final clue was hard to find? [Barbie] It'll take at least a summer. Oh, just what this town needs, more treasure hunters. As long as they don't give up, someday, someone will find it. Hey, guys! Wait up [bells chiming simple melody]
