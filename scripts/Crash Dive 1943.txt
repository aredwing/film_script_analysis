Survivors off the starboard bow. Tell 'em I got it. Throw 'em a line. - Any water, mister? - Yes, plenty, laddie. Periscope off starboard bow. Everybody, back in the boat. Take your stations. Cast off!. We'll be back for you. Man your battle stations. Stand by for depth charge attack. The sub's been stalking that lifeboat, trying to knock off a rescue ship. We'll see what we can do for him. - Yes? - Captain Bryson? Captain Bryson is not here. This is Admiral Stewart. What is it? Somebody to see the commandant, sir. Lieutenant Ward Stewart. - Shall I have him wait? - No, have him come in. - Hello, Ward. - Why, Uncle Bob... what are you doing so far from Washington? I'm here on an inspection tour. Come in. Thank you. Well, it certainly is an unexpected pleasure seeing you here. I was supposed to go back this morning, but I'm staying till tomorrow night. And I'm glad, because it's given me this chance to see you. Sit down. Thanks. Maybe you can tell me why they sent for me. Oh, yes. Well, we'll come to that. First, I wanna tell you what a swell job you did sinking that submarine. - Thank you, sir. - It was a neat job of work all around. Tell me about it. Well, there isn't much to tell. That U-boat never had a chance. Matter of fact, no submarine has much of a chance against those P.T. boats. You like the P. T. boats, eh? Like 'em? It's absolutely the best branch of the service. You said that about battleships when you were in one. Well, P.T.'s a flyweight battleship, only much more maneuverable. And I recall your enthusiasm for cruisers when you were serving in them. P.T.'s a bantam cruiser, only much easier to handle. And when you were in destroyers. P.T.'s a lightweight destroyer, only faster. It's a great fighting ship. I understand exactly how you feel. I feel the same way about submarines and the men in them. They're picked men. Picked for their character. Their sense of duty and discipline, their hearts and their heads. They're a wonderful body of men. Not enough of them. There's a shortage of trained officers. Um, about my being ordered to New London, sir. That was my suggestion, Ward. - How long were you in submarines? - Two years. - With an excellent record, as I recall. - Thank you, sir. I was mighty glad to get out of them if you don't mind my saying so. That's quite all right. I'm interested in your views on submarines. Well- Go ahead. - Off the record, Uncle Bob? - Off the record. Well, as far as I'm concerned, it's no life for a dog, even a sea dog. I'd much rather sink 'em than sail 'em any day. Well, my boy, it looks like you're going to sail 'em. But the P.T.s, Uncle Bob. I wouldn't be happy in any other branch of the service. The Stewarts have been in the navy for three generations. - They've been happy in any branch of the service. - Yes, sir. Do you think I'm tied to my desk in Washington because I prefer it? No, sir. I'm serving where I'm needed most. And you're being assigned where you're needed most. Yes, sir, you're right. I'm sorry. I- I'll be very glad to get back to submarines. - That's the spirit. - Still, um... Yes? - If I may say so- - Go right ahead. Those P.T.s are a work of art, sir. So are the submarines. - That's right. - I'll have you meet Captain Bryson. - He'll introduce you to your new skipper. - They, uh... they shipped me up here so quickly, I didn't have a chance... to attend to some personal business. - I wonder if I could have weekend leave. - Why, certainly. You rate a bit of leave. I'm sure it can be arranged. Thank you, sir. There they go... out to sea. Well, there they go. Yeah, we'll be going this time next week. Yes, sir, maybe. What do you mean maybe, McDonnell? Well, we can't leave without an executive officer, can we, sir? - Certainly not. - And we ain't got no executive officer, have we, sir? Captain Bryson promised we'd have one last week. Yes, sir, but we didn't get one last week. We didn't get one this week. And we probably won't get one next week. No? We'll see about that. - How are you, Dewey? - Good morning, sir. - You look as though you had steam to blow off. - Yes, I have. May I blow it? - Go ahead. Open the valves. - A whole slew of submarines just pulled out of here, sir. Every day, boats are shoving off and we stayed tied up to the dock. My men are getting fat, and my boat's getting barnacles on it... all on account of a replacement, one measly replacement. - You're not due to leave until next week, are you? - No, sir... but we won't be able to leave then unless we get that man. What's the matter with Washington, sir? Why don't they unscrew that guy... from his swivel chair and send him down here so we can get away from that dock? I take it you're inquiring about your new executive officer. - Yes, sir. - Well, here he is. Mr. Connors, meet Lieutenant Stewart. - How do you do, sir? - I'll see you later, gentlemen. Glad to meet you, Stewart. I hope you'll overlook that crack about the swivel chair. - Sure, sure. - What was your last ship? Mosquito boat, sir. P.T. 14. Oh, I certainly hated to leave it. I developed quite a yen for those fast, open boats... and frankly, this is gonna be quite a letdown. - Cigarette, sir? - Thanks. - Annapolis, huh? - Yes, sir. Class of'36. Care to have a look at the boat? Well, you see, I came here with only a toothbrush, sir... and the admiral's been kind enough to let me have weekend leave... so I could clear up a little personal business. - That is if it's all right with you, sir. - That's all right with me. Everybody says it'll be a long war. Thank you, sir. Well, Captain? Well, we got our executive officer, Mac. That is, we will have him Monday, I hope. Oh, Mac, go back to the boat and tell Mr. Brown to take over. - I'll be back in a couple of hours. - Aye, aye, sir. Out you get, girls. Come on. That's it. Elbert, you'll take care of the luggage and take care of the girls... - and see that they get on the train, won't you? - Yes, ma'am. - I'll be right along. - Hello, sweet. You had me worried. - I thought you were going to miss your train. - Oh, Dewey, darling... I'm so sorry I was late, but I didn't know till the last minute. What is this,Jean, an air raid drill? Are you moving the whole school? No,just the honor students. They get the trip as a prize. Miss Bromley was going to take them herself... but she had a toothache, so I was elected. I thought it was kind of sudden. Where you taking them, teacher? Oh,just a few places of historic interest. - How long you gonna be away? - Several days. - Several days? - When you go away on your ship... it's for several weeks. Now you know how I feel. - You mean to say you miss me? - I mean to say. - That's nice. Come on. - Aboard! I wish I were an honor student,Jean, so I could come along too. Why don't you? You could make the next train. - Can't you get away for a few days? - I'm afraid that's impossible. - I wish I could. - Can't you even get one day's leave? - Now don't tempt me. - Aboard! I'm gonna miss you an awful lot, darling. - Drop me a line, will you? - I'll call you. - Have a nice trip. Good-bye. - Aboard! Good-bye. Oh, I bought these for you! - Good night, darling. - Good night, Miss Hewlitt. Shh, girls, wait a minute. Other people are trying to sleep here. Good night. Sleep tight. Get to bed. Go on. Go to sleep. Button up. - Oh! - Good evening. - It's a small world, isn't it? - What are you doing in my berth? You know that I was just about to ask you that same question. What are you going to do? - I'm going to call the porter and have him put you out. - I wouldn't if I were you. It's liable to create an unfortunate impression not warranted by the facts. It is not your berth. I have lower six. There seems to be a difference of opinion about that... but it's certainly easy enough to find out. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. What do you know about that? You're right. Social error. My ticket calls for upper six. Please accept my apologies. - Now will you please get out? - Yes, ma'am. Anything I can do for you, Miss Hewlitt? Oh, no, no. Thank you very much. Would you mind taking that ladder off my foot? Oh, I'm sorry. Good night. Glad to have you aboard. Excuse me, I left my cig- Oh,yes, of course, there it is. Thank you. I hope I haven't inconvenienced you. Good night. Oh! Oh, thank you. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good morning. This way, sir. Good morning. I hope you slept well last night. And the children? They had me worried when I saw you rounding them up this morning. I thought you were their mother. I was relieved to find out you're only their teacher. The porter told me. I was interested to hear... that these young ladies are sort of super quiz kids... that you're taking them on a tour as a reward for being at the head of their class. The porter mentioned it to me. By the way, Miss Hewlitt, I understand you're going to Washington. The porter. My name is Ward Stewart. I know Washington very well. It's a madhouse there now. Standing room only. I sincerely hope for your sake you have your hotel reservations. - By the way, where are you staying? - Ask the porter. Come on, girls. - Try the Mayflower. - But I've got a reservation, I tell ya. - It expired at noon. - Well, it's only five after that now. Uh, please, sir, try the Mayflower. What do you know about that? You give up everything... to come here and work for a dollar a year, and you can't find a place to live. Big man in Texas, ain't ya? What do your constituents say? I'll see the postmaster general about this! - I hope he mails us back. - Oh, please, sir, try the Mayflower. - We did try the Mayflower. There's not a thing over there. - Try the Mayflower. - Try the Mayflower. - We've tried the Mayflower... and they told us to try the Carlton. I've been to every other hotel in Washington. We walked our feet off. The children are about to collapse. We don't have to have a suite. We'll take one room if necessary. Have you tried the Mayflower? - Would you get me Mr. Simmons on the desk, please? - Yes, Lieutenant. - Couldn't you put us in the basement? - The basement is all filled up. Then give us a tent and we'll pitch it on the roof. I mean it. I'm sorry, Miss, but the roof is- Hello? Hello, Mr. Simmons? This is Lieutenant Stewart speaking. - Yes, sir. - I'm checking out, but on one condition. I want the young lady that you're talking to now to have my rooms. Wait a minute. Don't you tell her that I suggested it. I understand, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. You're the luckiest woman in Washington. We've just had a cancellation. - We were here first. - Pardon me. Thank you, sir. Peggy, come out of the shower and give some of the other girls a chance. Anybody there? - Well! - Well! Really, this is too much. What do you mean by following me around? The following seems to be with the other foot now. - These happen to be my rooms. - They're nothing of the sort. If you'd take the time to look around, you'd find my baggage is still here someplace. There was some luggage here, but I had it moved to the storage room. Well, I'm sorry. You'll have to have it moved right back in again. You had no right to move my baggage out of my rooms. - These might have been, but you checked out. - I did nothing of the kind. Yes, you did. I heard the clerk take the call. Well, it didn't come from me. Wait a minute. I'm surprised at you. That's an old trick. Everybody knows it. You can't get any accommodations... so you have one of your confederates call up... check somebody out and then you barge in. Are you accusing me of such a cheap, shabby trick? All I know is that I didn't check out. All I know is that I checked in and I'm staying in. - You'll have to find other quarters. - Where? I don't know. C'est la guerre. Try the Mayflower. Just a minute, young lady. I don't have to remind you that the armed forces have priority over civilians. - Where's that telephone? - What are you going to do? - I'm going to call the house detective. - Wait a minute. Please. - Yes? - We're only gonna be here such a short while. - Couldn't you- - No, I couldn't. This is what you get for not casting your bread upon the waters. What bread? Last night when I moved in on you by mistake, you flung me out. You wouldn't even say good night, and I gave you three chances. And this morning when I tried to help you, you walked right out on me. I apologize. - Now, Captain- - Lieutenant! I throw myself entirely on your generosity. For myself, I could manage, but the children- poor dears- they're so exhausted. Lieutenant, surely- Well, I'll, uh... I'll have to give this some thought. I'm against appeasement as a rule, but in this case... I'm willing to discuss a negotiated peace. You keep the bedroom, I'll take the parlor. Oh, but, Lieutenant, we're seven, you're only one. Since you're an officer and a gentleman- And I was a Boy Scout. All right, you win. You can have the whole works. - Oh, thank you so much. - Under certain conditions. Oh? Now, you know from your own experience how difficult it would be... for me to find anyplace to sleep in Washington. Don't you know anybody here? Well, I know an admiral, but you wouldn't have me inconvenience him. Well, you might try a Turkish bath. No, no, no. I'm allergic to steam. No, I'm afraid there's only one out for me. I'll just have to stay up all night. - Oh, I'm sorry. - No, don't think anything more of it. I'm- I'm quite used to staying up all night. It's just that I- I get terribly lonesome. But we can cure that too. You'll have dinner with me. But that's impossible. Why, the children, I have to- Oh, well, the little angels can have dinner sent up here. Then I'll pick you up afterwards and take you on a personally conducted tour of Washington. The time will fly by, and before you know it, it'll be morning. Are you suggesting that I stay up all night? No, no, no, not at all. Not all of it. Just part of it. Say till, uh, midnight. Is that agreeable? - Certainly not. - Very well. Would you send up a Pinkerton man, please? - Oh, please, don't do that. - Cancel it. That isn't gold on your uniform, it's brass. There's an embassy party tonight. What time shall I pick you up? Do you realize this is blackmail? Make it 7:00. It's terribly crowded here, don't you think? - It's nicer out here, isn't it? - Divine. Who is that nice little man you introduced me to in there? - What little man was that? - You know, the one with glasses. Oh, his name was Litvinoff. He was cute. Did you say Litvinoff? Yes, Litvinoff. When I tell them back home I met the Russian ambassador, they won't believe me. - How do you feel? - I'm having a wonderful time. You're entitled to it. You're a wonderful girl. You make up your mind very quickly, don't you? Well, I know. I'm an expert. You might even say I'm a connoisseur. I have an answer for that... but I can't think of it just now. Champagne. What time is it? Time stops on a night like this. Psst, Alice. Look and see what time it is, will you? Five after 3:00. Five after 3:00? And Miss Hewlitt isn't home yet? She said she'd be home no later than midnight. - Should we worry? - Something must have happened to Miss Hewlitt. - Should we do something? - We could call the police. Yeah, that's it! Let's do that! Shh! - How are they? - Sound asleep. Bless their little hearts. - What about tomorrow? - Tomorrow? I mean, today. Tonight. Will you have dinner with me? I'm afraid not. I don't think we should see each other anymore. You know, it'll be a crime if you don't get to know me better. Oh, an egotist. All right, then, it'll be a crime if I don't get to know you better. No, really, I think it'd be much better if it ends now. Tell you what I'll do. I'll make a deal with you. Have dinner with me tonight, and if after that you still feel the same way you do now... I- I promise never to see you again. Is that a deal? It's a deal. Good night,Jean. - Good night. - I'll pick you up at 7:00 sharp. - Miss Jean Hewlitt, please. - Miss Hewlitt checked out, Lieutenant. What? - Mr. Simmons, when did Miss Hewlitt check out? - Yes, sir. About an hour ago. Oh, by the way... she left a note for you, Lieutenant. - Mr. Simmons, did she leave any forwarding address? - Yes, sir. Just a moment. Bromley School for Girls, New London. - What? New London? - Yes, sir. - Connecticut? - Connecticut. No, it can't be. It's illogical. - Things like that just don't happen. - I don't understand, sir. Try the Mayflower. Ambassadors, senators, diplomats, generals and admirals. Everybody who's anybody in Washington was there. We had a fabulous time. We had caviar and drank champagne. And danced the whole night through. It was just like a dream. A lovely dream. But I don't understand why you broke your date with him the next day. - Strategic retreat. - Oh. - To avoid encirclement, huh? - It was only an episode. But for a moment, it had me worried. Jean, how about your friend the Rock of Gibraltar? Haven't you got a guilty conscience? Don't be silly. The Rock's the one you marry. After all, we're not engaged. It's a small world, isn't it? - It's him! - Why so frightened? He is a dream. That's one I didn't want walking around here. What'll I do? If it were I, I'd probably break an ankle rushing downstairs. Miss Hewlitt. Miss Hewlitt! Oh! How did you find me? The porter told me. Can I come up? - It's against the rules. - Well,you come down then. No callers are permitted on the school premises, except parents. Well, I'm not a parent yet. Someday I hope to be. Please come down. It's terribly important. Practically a crisis. Suppose Miss Bromley should see him standing there. - Do you want me to go down and get rid of him for you? - Will you? Oh, I'd be glad to. May I borrow your lipstick, please? Never mind. I'll get rid of him myself. Well? Teacher, I brought you something. Thank you. I told you no one was allowed on these premises. - You got back safely? - Quite safely. - How are the children? - Fine. Thank you. - Oh, bless their little hearts. Would you mind getting down to the crisis? The crisis? Oh, yes, yes. The last time I saw you, we made an arrangement. But you didn't keep your end of the bargain. I'm gonna give you another chance. Will you have dinner with me tonight? I have an appointment for dinner. - You are the most beautiful- - Don't say it. You know, when you broke that date with me... you said you thought it'd be safer for you in New London than Washington. Is that what you want? Safety? Yes. You know, you present quite a problem. I think I can solve it for you. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Good-bye and good luck. Miss Hewlitt, I- I don't care for any dessert, thanks. What are you dreaming about, sweet? Dewey, let's get married. - Hmm? What? - Let's get married. - When? - Tonight. I've been wanting to ask you that for weeks. Why didn't you? Well, I... sort of waiting to get another stripe on my sleeve. I know that sounds funny,Jean... but I wouldn't want you to marry anyone under the rank of a full commander, at least. But I don't want to marry a rank, Dewey, I want to marry you. Oh, it's not the rank. It takes money to get married,Jean. Not the original cost but the upkeep. I want you to have a place of your own. That's where the pay comes in. Probably we'll have some brats of our own too. That's where the pay comes in again. We have to think of those things. Especially now when we're at war and everything is so- Well, anyway, it's nice to know that everything's snug and safe ashore. Snug and safe. Yes, it is nice to know. But I don't feel that way without you. Well, darling, maybe when we get back, we'll have- Get back? Are you going to sea? Mm-hmm. We're leaving tonight. Oh, I wouldn't worry about it. Just a little fishing trip. - Chapman. Hirschfield. Millard. Montroffsky. - Chapman. Hirschfield. Millard. Montroffsky. - Montroffsky. - On watch in the engine room. Williams. Rutlidge. - On the bridge. - All present and accounted for, sir. All right, men. Fall out and gather round. Most of you have sailed on the Corsair before. I don't need to say anything to you. To the new men aboard, I have only this to say. Since Pearl Harbor, this ship has always returned from a cruise... with a broom at the masthead- a clean sweep. I know we'll do it again. Mr. Stewart, make preparations to get underway immediately. Aye, aye, sir. Station the sea detail. First section has the watch. First section, sea detail. - All set, Mr. Stewart? - Yes, sir. - Take her out. - Aye, aye, sir. Take in two and three. Take in two and three. - Take in four. - Take in four. - Take in one. - Take in one. Starboard back two-thirds. Port back one-third. Starboard back two-thirds. Port back one-third. - Rudder amidships. - Rudder amidships. Hey, Chief, how 'bout a little relief? I've been on for six hours. That's right. Okay, Mr. Burr. Oh, Pat. Come on and take the manifold. Okay. Aft torpedo room. After torpedo room. After torpedo room. Aye, aye. Send Rogers to control room to relieveJohn- to relieveJohnson on the bow planes. Aye, aye, sir. Sure is close quarters, Chief. What's wrong, Chief? My- Nothing. Um, a little attack of indigestion. I guess I'll be all right. Leave me alone. I'm all right. How 'bout a cup of coffee, Chief? No, I don't want any java. Thank you. - Hey, you asleep, Doc? - Huh? Oh, hello, Oliver. You're a pharmacist's mate. What do they put nitroglycerin in pills for? - Nitroglycerin? - Yeah. That's what they give to people whose hearts are on the blink. Why? Something wrong with your ticker? No. No, I'm all right. I was just inquiring for a friend. Oh, well, if I were you, I'd tell him to see the doctor... before he took any of those. Yeah. - What is the depth, Brownie? - Seventy-five feet, sir. Bring up to periscope depth. I wanna have a look. Aye, aye, sir. Forty feet. - Get that problem solved, Brownie? - Yeah. It was a lane 100 miles long and 14 miles wide. See what I mean? Thirty days to patrol a lane 14 miles wide and 100 miles long. Those torpedo boats could have patrolled the whole North Atlantic... in half that time, with the Caribbean thrown in. Have you seen those new P.T.s? They've got everything on them but a waffle iron. Look. - Mr. Stewart? Come take a look. - Yes, sir. If you were on a P.T. boat with a waffle iron, what would you say that was? It's a freighter, sir. Right rudder, new course 250. Right rudder, new course 250, sir. It's a Swedish flag. Seems to be in distress. The men are working on something aft. - They might be shipping cargo, sir. - Might be laying mines. Laying mines? Out here? Have a look. Down periscope. - Stations for battle surface. All ahead two-thirds. - All ahead two-thirds, sir. Stations for battle surface. Stations for battle surface. Stations for battle surface. Battle surface, take 'er up. Hard right. Blow one, two and five. Show them our colors. - Amerikana. - Oh. Tell them to stand by for boarding and inspection of ship's papers. Wunderbar. - Prepare to board her, Mr. Stewart. - Aye, aye, sir. I'm sorry we haven't got a P.T. boat to send you over in, but, uh- Get this boat back to the sub as quick as you can. Commence firing! Cover Mr. Stewart! - Achtung! - Achtung! Achtung! Fire! - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! Fire! That Q-boat's got us outgunned. It'll blow us out of the water. Don't you think we oughta dive? Not till those guys get back here. Come on. Step on it! Take 'er down, Captain. Crash dive 'er. We'll take our chances! Come on! Cease firing. Secure all guns. Stand by to dive. Fire! It's a cinch they'll start dropping ash cans. - How much water we got under us, Brownie? - Fifteen fathoms, sir. - Flood auxiliary from "C." - Flood auxiliary from "C." I'm taking her to the bottom, Mr. Stewart. All right, brace yourselves, men. We're gonna hit. - Achtung! Fire! - Achtung! Fire! Fire! All right, boys. Take it easy. Smoking lamp is lit for 10 minutes. Pass the word. All hands, smoking lamp is lit, 10 minutes. Thank you, Mr. Stewart. You better go forward and see how the men are, Mr. Stewart. Yes, sir. Fire! - Everything quiet and serene forward, sir. - Very well. After torpedo room reports flooding, sir. - Take it, Mac. - Aye, aye, sir. - Stand by my hold, Pat. - Okay, Chief. - Secure the watertight doors. - Secure the watertight doors. - Shall I sound the crash alarm, sir? - And let that Q-boat hear us? - Belay it. - Turn on your high-pressure pump. Break out the corking tools. Emergency chores. Stand by air salvage! Turn on emergency light. Hurry up, will ya? If only I were up there in one of those P.T. boats. Well, you're not, Mr. Stewart. Oh, Mr. Stewart. Go forward and tell them to take the torpedoes out of one and two. - Did you say out? - I said out. Aye, aye, sir. - Brownie, bring out about 10 life jackets... - Sir? and bring 'em forward, on the double. I don't get it. What's the skipper taking the fish out for? Tell Oliver to rustle up all the empty packing cases and debris he can find. Help him bring it in here. Men, strip off your clothes. Down to your skivvies. - Captain, would you tell me- - When you can't get away, Mr. Stewart, you play possum. - Are they ready? - Yes, sir. - Gimme those caps. - Here they are, sir. - Fill up the impulse air pressure. - Yes, sir. - All right, open number one, Mr. Stewart. - Aye, aye, sir. - Engine room. - Engine room, aye, aye. Stand by to pump 100 gallons of fuel out overboard. - Open the outer doors. - Aye, sir. - Stand by, Mr. Stewart. Engine room? - Yes, sir. - Outer doors open, sir. - Engine room, aye, aye. - Pump the oil overboard. - Aye, aye. You all set? - One set, sir. - Fire one. Secure the outer doors. Come along, Mr. Stewart. Aye, sir. The captain's hit his head. Bowman, get the pharmacist's mate. - Aye, sir. - Help get the captain to his cabin. Control room, control room, pharmacist's mate to the captain's quarters. - I. - I. Wunderbar. Where's that Q-boat? Bearing 50, sir. Can you give me an estimate on her speed? Five knots, sir. Well, looks like the skipper fooled them. They won't drop any more ash cans. Now's the time to get away. Now's the time to get, period. Mac, how much water do we have to take in to put her on the bottom? - 4,000 pounds, sir. - We're coming up. - Pump from auxiliary to sea. - Pump from auxiliary to sea. - How are the bilges aft? - Torpedo room's practically dry, sir. - 1,000 out. - Put those fish back in one and two. - Aye, aye. - 2,000 out. - When she breaks loose, bring her up easily. - Aye, sir. - 3,000 out. - Secure at 5,000. Secure at 5,000, sir. Now we're loose. Remember, bring her up easy. Eighty. - All ahead one-third. - All ahead one-third, sir. - Gimme a bearing. Where is she? - Bearing 52, sir. Motor room answers all ahead one-third, sir. - Right full rudder. - Right full rudder, sir. - New course 290. - New course 290, sir. - Sixty. - Can you level her off and hold her at 40 feet? - Aye, sir. - Q-boat slowing down, sir. Coming up awful fast. More dive on the bow planes. More dive on the bow planes. - 40. - Up periscope. - Hold it. Steady as you go. - Steady as you go, sir. - Are all torpedo tubes ready for firing? - Three and four ready, sir. - Mark. - 285, sir. Enemy bearing 003. Angle on the bow, 80 port. - One and two are ready, sir. - They stopped, Brownie. Enemy speed: Zero. Watch your depth, Stevie. Watch your depth. Range: 1,200. - Firing order one and two. - Firing order one and two. You're right on it, sir. - Stand by, one. - Stand by, one. - Fire one. - Fire one. One fired, sir. Well, babies, you're on your way. Do your stuff. - Stand by, two. - Stand by, two. - Fire two. - Fire two. Two fired, sir. Bring 'er up, Stevie. Roll one, two and five. Little chilly, but a beautiful evening, Mr. Stewart. - Lovely. - I'm off watch, but I hate to think about going below. Mac, tell Oliver to bring me up a cup of coffee. - Aye, sir. - Tell him to make it two, Mac. Aye, sir. Nice work for all of us. Beautiful evening. Yes, it is. It's usually like that in these latitudes. - How do you feel, Captain? - Oh, fine. I want to congratulate you on the way you got that Q-boat. Well, he'd have got us if you hadn't played possum. You know, I'm thinking someday... they'll make a torpedo boat that'll submerge. That's funny you should mention that, Captain... 'cause I've been thinking of a way to make a submarine go 50 knots. Here. Cigarette? Thanks, Dewey. You're welcome, Ward. Let's go below and have a smoke. Hello, Dewey! - Gee, it's nice to see you back. - Where'd you get that broom? Don't tell 'em. Make 'em guess. Ah, it sure feels good to see the sun after 60 days. Get me the officers' club, will you, please? You see what I mean? You come back from one of these cruises... and look like you've been born in a pool room and graduated from Alcatraz. Sure, but you head for these lights, and before you know it... you look and feel like you just got back from Palm Beach. On a P.T. boat, you don't have to depend on a sunlamp. Will you pipe down about those P.T.s for a while? - Here you are, sir. - Thank you. Give me the dining room, please. Yes, on those P.T.s, you get the real article all day long- sun and wind and spray. This is Lieutenant Commander Connors speaking. We just got back from a cruise. We're coming over for lunch. There'll be two of us. Oh, no. No meats, no steaks, no chops. We want vegetables. - Fresh vegetables. - Fresh vegetables. All you've got. And milk. - Not out of cans. - Not out of cans. And fruit. Plenty of fresh fruit. Watermelon. And above all, butter. - Fresh butter, and all they've got. - All you've got. Right. Ah, fresh celery. - Hello, Lee. How are you? - Fine, sir. Glad to see you ashore. - You get our the rest of our order? - Yes, sir. Coming right up, sir. - Excuse me, Ward. I got to make a phone call. - Right. Oh, fresh butter. When have I seen you before? - Just an appetizer, sir. - Mmm. Just an appetizer, hmm? Hello, Bromley School? Could you get a message to Miss Jean Hewlitt when she's through with class? Ask her to call Commander Connors... at the officers' club at the sub base. That's right. Thank you. Say, are you following me around? No, sir. I ain't following you. I'm just walking with you. Well, if you're walking with me, walk up where I can see you... - not in back of me. - Okay. Wherever I am, you are. Wherever I go, you go. I got a feeling you're spying on me. What is this? Well, I don't know, Chief. I guess what you might call coincidence. - You know, Captain, this is Michigan celery. - Oh, Mac. McDonnell,just a minute. Excuse me, Ward. - Captain. - Got a bit of good news for you, Mac. - News, sir? - I just saw some papers over on the captain's desk. What papers, sir? I don't know who, but somebody recommended you for promotion to warrant. Oh. Well, that's wonderful of you, Captain. You'll pass your physical, and it's in the bag. Yes, sir. Thanks a million, Captain. So, uh, you're gonna make us salute, huh, Chief? - Is that it, Lee? - Yes, sir. - Oh, is that gorgeous! - Oh, boy. And milk. Let's have some of that. Fill 'em up. Am I gonna spoil that beautiful arrangement. You better dive into this, Ward. There's not gonna be any left. I'll be with you in just a minute. There you are. You can't get milk like that from a sea cow. Ahh. Ambrosia. Fill it up again. Nectar. Make it two. - You better get another pitcher, Lee. - Yes, sir. - How 'bout some watermelon? - Yes, sir. Mr. Connors? Telephone, sir. Oh, boy. That's the call I've been waiting for. Excuse me, Ward. Hello, darling. I love you. I love you. I appreciate that, Dewey. Thanks very much. And it's mutual. Oh, Captain Bryson. I'm terribly sorry, sir. - I was expecting another call. - So I gathered. Dewey, how soon can you leave for Washington? Washington, sir? Don't tell me they're gonna transfer me. Well, don't worry about that. The department wants you to make a personal report and possibly express their appreciation. When can you leave? On the next plane, sir, I suppose. Very well. I'll be right over. Chief. - Chief McDonnell. - What do you want? Well, I was delivering the captain's laundry. Yours was ready, so I thought I'd bring it up. Who told you to come up here? Nobody. But it was ready, so I just thought I'd bring it on up. All right. Put it over there. Well, how'd you come out on your physical? - What physical? - For your promotion to warrant officer. I decided to turn it down. - Turn it down? - Sure. What do I want with it? More work, more grief. I'm satisfied where I am. I don't want any promotion. Maybe you'd rather have a pension. What do you mean, pension? Mac, it's none of my business... and it certainly isn't up to me to give you advice, but... if I had a weak heart- What are you talking about? A man don't take nitroglycerin for dandruff. Who told you? I saw you get the fit on the ship. And I saw you take the little pills. Mac, it's no disgrace to get sick. Maybe if you told a doctor, he could fix you up- And put me on the beach for the rest of my life, huh? No, thanks. I'm satisfied the way I am. I don't want any promotion. And I don't want any pension. I know just what I want. And if you say anything about it, you sneaking little stool pigeon, I'll- Sit down, Oliver. I'm sorry. I can't understand how you got by on your last physical. Oh, that was okay. I didn't have the first attack till a couple months ago... and I went and saw a civilian doctor. Yeah, but there'll be a routine checkup in three months. But there'll be one more cruise before then. You'll understand when I tell you something... something I've never told anybody else in the world. It was in the last war- my first tour of duty in a submarine- and I wasn't sick. I was pretending. So they left me ashore. Was you afraid? Ship never came back. She was sunk in action. All the crew was lost. All except me. I was safe ashore. Now do you see? Yeah. I see. So you'll... keep your trap shut, won't you? Don't worry about me. The way I see it, nobody consults nobody when he's born... so they oughta give him a little leeway when he's- I- I- I mean, if he's- Thanks, mate. See you around, Mac. Now, look, girls, I wanna tell you once again- pull the string back with your three forefingers... trying to rest your thumb- Feet 50 inches apart, and your bodies facing me squarely. All right. Ready, aim... fire. That was all right, girls. Let's try it once again quickly, shall we? And try to remember your form. All right. Aim... fire! Oh, many a shaft at random spent... finds marks the archer never meant. Girls, you can relax just a moment. How many times do I have to tell you to stay away from here? Many a word at random spoken can soothe or wound a heart that's broken. - You know who wrote that? - Please go away. - Sir Walter Scott. - I beg of you. Do you want me to lose my job? I have a suggestion to make, or call it an offer. - Would you like to get rid of me? - Most decidedly. Good. Then have dinner with me tonight-just once. And I promise never to see you again unless you insist on it. - What do you say? - No. - Is that final? - Yes. Who's this coming along here? Could it be Miss Bromley? Tsk, tsk, tsk. Now, she wouldn't want to find me here. What about tonight? In all my life, I've never met a more unscrupulous man, a man with less principle. What time should I pick you up tonight and where? 7:00. Outside the school. Hello, Miss Bromley. Taking your afternoon constitutional? Attention, girls. We'll try it once again. Would you mind telling me, after riding for three hours, where we're going? - The best restaurant in the state. - Yes, but what state? - Massachusetts. - If you don't mind, I'd rather eat in Connecticut. Sorry. We've already crossed the state line. We're almost there. What sort of a place are you taking me to? A roadhouse. - Is this it? - Mm-hmm. - You're sure this is the place? - It certainly is. I've been here dozens of times. You'll love it- not only the food, but the atmosphere... the privacy. We have to ring the bell to get in? Yes, of course. It's very exclusive. Mr. Ward! Good evening, sir. - Good evening. - I'm so glad to see you. - I suppose you're looking for- - Reservations. Yes. - I hope they've been well taken care of. - Reservations, sir? - How's business? - Business, sir? Yes, the last time I was here, you were jammed. Oh, the war, I suppose. - Can't expect business as usual. Hmm? - Uh,yes, sir. Would you like a drink or go to the bar? - Miss Hewlitt, I can explain. - I don't think so. You mentioned several times that this is rather a small world. I never agreed with you until now. You're right. It is small. Too small for the both of us. - Now look. Just a minute If you'll- - Hi, Stinky! - Hello, Butch! - Come up here, you old sea dog. Give us a kiss. - Hello. How are you this evening? - You don't know her. - Oh, a new one. - Yes. Scoundrel. Why didn't you write? Dear heart, there are no letter boxes in the North Atlantic. - But I was thinking of you. That's why I'm here tonight. - You're a liar. You're here for some ulterior motive. Probably grub. Grandmother, may I present Miss Hewlitt? - Hello. - How do you do? Where'd you get this one? Darling, you were saying something about some grub. - I think I will go have a talk with the cook. - He can pick 'em. - I beg your pardon? - You play gin rummy? - Well, I just learned- - A pigeon. Come along. Henry? - Yes, madam? - Dry martinis. - Yes, madam. - This way to the slaughterhouse. Yes. Yes, he was very funny when he was a kid. There's been a big change since then. Ah. Midshipman. It took all our influence to keep him from being thrown out of the academy the first year. I graduated with honors. I was among the first six. There was always something very queer about that. I don't think he could possibly be as bad as you say he was. Or as good as you say you were. I remember that was taken the first day he went to school. I suggested reform school. They wouldn't take my advice. - Aw, look at that. - A demon. An imp of Satan if ever there was one. Well, if you don't believe me, look at that. - How adorable! - No, no. That's all. That's all for tonight. What a guy. I shall never forget the first time we took him to Europe. - There was a girl- - Miss Hewlitt is not interested in your aimless meandering. Besides, it's way past your bedtime. I get you, Steve. - Good night. - Good night. You're okay. The McCoy. I approve of her entirely. Come on, Butch. Go to bed. Go to bed. Oh, Stinky. All right. Give us a kiss. Hewlitt, watch out for him. He'll charm the shirt off your back if you give him the chance. I know. I haven't got a shirt left. How do you like that? Gin rummy before dinner... and she's monopolized your whole evening with that album. - I ought to apologize for her. - You don't have to. I think she's wonderful. So sweet. Well, in her palmy days, they do say- She had three husbands that we know of. - Would you like some more coffee? - No, thanks. - It's getting awfully late. Don't you think we- - Oh, no, no. Sit down. I haven't had a chance to see you alone all evening, and I've got to talk to you. - No, I think- - Please. Sit down. - Have a cigarette. - No, thanks. Wait. Where'd you get this picture? Clipped it out of the newspaper. That U.S.O. party the other night. I'm starting a new album. Now,just relax. If I get out of line, you can scream... and Butch will come charging down. - Of course, she's a little deaf, you know. - I can scream loud enough. Yes, I'm sure of that. I think it's time that we came to an understanding. Just what do we mean to each other? I'll be quite honest with you. - The other night, when you bumped into me in my berth- - In my berth. Okay, your berth. I thought you were very stunning. Yes, that's it. And I was stunned by you. Of course, my, uh, intentions at that time- - You don't need to go any further. - Thank you. When I was away on that cruise... I thought of you an awful lot. - Even under the sea I thought of you. - And on the surface? I thought how nice it would be if this girl... this awfully swell girl and I could, uh... could be friends. That's all I ask,Jean. Will you give me your hand on it? If I do, how do I know you won't throw me over your shoulder? I promise not to. My friend, I think it's time that I take you home. Thank you... my friend. Good morning. Good morning. Here you are at home, safe and sound. Are, um- Are you wide awake? - Yes. - Then listen. We've been friends long enough. It's time we adjusted our relationship. We've either got to be less than friends or more than friends. Jean- Do you know what this is? - It's your class ring. - Mm-hmm. And do you know what it means if I put this on your finger? Yes. Hello, Miss Bromley. Taking your morning constitutional? Ah, it's a lovely day. Loveliest day of my life. - Taxi? - Well, this is what I call service. Do my eyes deceive me, or is that another stripe I see? Congratulations. - So that's why they sent for you in such a hurry, huh? - Just a mere detail. What they really wanted was to get the dope on our little run-in... we had with that mine-laying Q-boat. They're pretty concerned about it. They figure they must have a secret base around there somewhere. - Remember where that was? - Do I? Remember me? I was in the rubber boat. Well, we're going out that way again. It may interest you to know we're leaving tonight. Well, we'd better get going. Where to, Commander? Let's go to my quarters and split a bottle. Yes, it was right around there someplace. Yeah. That's the area where we've had our greatest shipping losses, Ward. The only clue we've got is that Q-boat we sunk. Wherever it came from must be the U-boat base. Our job is to locate that base and, if possible, destroy it. What do you mean, "if possible"? It's not as easy as you think, Ward. It's like hunting for a needle in a haystack. Pretty tough assignment. Sure, it is. That's why they gave it to the best submarine skipper they've got. Eh, pipe down, will ya? Help yourself to the milk, Ward. I'm practically awash now. Better stow away plenty of it, Ward. It's gonna be a long cruise. Nice quarters you have here, Dewey. A lot better than my diggings. Well, it's for rent. Really? You kidding? No. When we get back from this cruise... - I'll be looking for a house. - A house? Yeah. You know that new stripe on my sleeve, Ward? That's more than a stripe. That's the marriage license. Well, you old granite-puss. You certainly can serve in silence. Congratulations. - When does it happen? - This afternoon, I hope. That's her. Beautiful, isn't she? Swell gal too. She's waiting for me at the officers' club now. - Say, wouldn't you like- - I'd like to, Dewey, but I have to run. - There's some things I've got to do. - Okay, Ward. I'll see you later. - Is Jean Hewlitt here? - Yes, sir. She's right over there, sir. Why, Ward, what are you- - Would you come out on the veranda where we can be alone? - Certainly. You make your own rules, don't you? - What do you mean? - About stringing a man along. In fact, two men. I just left Dewey Connors. Why didn't you tell me? In the beginning... I didn't think it mattered. And in the end, it mattered too much. - I thought it best to tell him first. - And what about me? I did everything I could to discourage you, and you know it. I didn't want to continue seeing you. You know that. I certainly didn't want to fall in love with you. But I did. Dewey Connors is coming here to ask you to marry him. - And I'm waiting here to tell him I can't. - You mustn't do that,Jean. What would you advise me to do? I'd... advise you to forget everything that I told you last night. - It all comes under the heading of- - Practice? Yes. That's it. You made it sound very convincing... a whole lot more convincing than what you're saying now. - Oh, Wong. - Yes, sir? - Have you seen Jean Hewlitt? - She's on the veranda with Mr. Stewart. - With who? - Lieutenant Stewart, sir. Well, thank you, Wong. I'm very fond of Dewey Connors... but I can't marry him... because I don't love him. I'm in love with you. If you hadn't come along, maybe I'd have married Dewey... but you did come along. We've got to be honest with him. - We've got to tell him. - That won't be necessary. D- Dewey, I- Captain. What is it, Mr. Stewart? Before we clear the channel, there's something else I'd like to clear. - I'm not interested. - All right. Forget about me. But I don't think you're being quite fair to her. - If you think for one minute- - Personal affairs and feelings have no place on the Corsair. When we get ashore, I'll be glad to take it up with you... any way you like. Very well, sir. That inlet's just like the last... and all the others- absolutely nothing. Well, we'd better find that secret base pretty soon. Their subs are doing an awful lot of damage to our ships. Besides, we got just about enough fuel oil left to get back to New London. Well, it's about time. What am I, a stepchild or something? - I'm sorry, Chief. - Cream? You know I never take cream in coffee. I know, Chief, but I thought maybe just for a change- Mr. Stewart, ship bearing 28. All ahead two thirds. Get all tubes ready for firing. Forward torpedo room. Get all tubes ready for firing. After torpedo room. Get all tubes ready for firing. Motor room answers all ahead two thirds. What's going on? Why wasn't I called? I picked up a tanker, sir. I'm getting all tubes ready for firing. Belay that order. We won't sink that ship. But none of our ships in this area, sir. That's an enemy craft. That's why I'm not sinking her now. We've got to. We'll lose her in the dark. Belay the orders, Mr. Stewart. Aye, aye, sir. Secure all tubes. - Secure all tubes. Captain, what are your plans, sir? If that's an enemy ship, it's operating from an enemy base. Ever play follow the leader, Brownie? When they open those submarine nets to let that tanker by... they'll be letting us through at the same time. But what about the mines? The harbor's probably full of them. Yeah, I know, but if we stay close... to the propellers of that tanker... we've got an excellent chance of getting through without getting blown up. - Come out slowly. - Come out slowly, sir. - Speed: Two knots. - Speed: Two knots, sir. - Change lights for night vision. - Aye, aye, sir. Gee, Chief, I can't get used to these red lights. That's because you never get out of this hull. Awful lot of help, though, when you have to see in the dark. - Forward torpedo room. - Aye, aye. Stand by. Ready to go through minefield. - Aft torpedo room. - Aye, aye. Stand by. Ready to go through minefield. Boy, I wonder what'd happen if we ever hit one of those mines. I don't know, but here's that five bucks I owe you. Mine cable. All right, Mr. Stewart, let's get on with our course. Holy mackerel. Look at those shore installations. And that harbor jammed with shipping. Boys, it looks like a grand slam. All stop. All stop, sir. We're in. Have all deck force not on watch muster in the control room immediately. All not on watch muster in the control room on the double. - Put her on the bottom. - All auxiliaries proceed through manifold. Auxiliary flooding slowly, sir. Well, men, this is the place we've been looking for. This is the base they've been operating from. Now, here's our plan. A landing party will go ashore for the purpose of demolishing the base. We'll surface just enough to let you men off. Now, when you blow up the ammunition dumps... that'll be my signal to attack the shipping in the harbor. We'll be operating on a split-second schedule. Exactly 30 minutes later... the Corsair will be standing by to take aboard those of the landing party... who can get back. Thirty minutes isn't much. Make every minute count. Mr. Stewart will be in charge of the landing party. I'm not going to ask for volunteers. I know you all want to go. So I'm gonna ask only the unmarried men to raise their hands. - Take over, Mr. Stewart. - Aye, aye, sir. Come forward, men. Oh, boy. Get the back of your neck too. What's so funny? I'm the only born commando here. Well, we're all set. Mac, take charge of the machine guns and all the demolition material. Oliver will give you a hand. Curly, you and Hammond rig the rubber boat. What are we gonna do, sir? Give the Germans a minstrel show? Some of you boys grab them tommy guns and give 'em a final check. - Are you ready to go? - Two or three minutes, sir. - I'd like to use one of them to have a word with you. - Well? - You know what our chances are of getting back. - Yes. Then you can believe that what I'm gonna tell you is the truth. It doesn't matter what you think of me... but don't feel any bitterness toward Jean. She played square with both of us. Believe me, I didn't know what she meant to you. If I had, I- Well, all that matters now is that you believe what I'm telling you is the truth. So long, Dewey. Good luck. Ease her up, Brownie. Come on, men. Seventy. Sixty. Forty. - Twenty. - Open the hatch. - Remember, 30 minutes. - Aye, aye, sir. Take her down, Brownie. What does it look like, Mr. Stewart? If they don't see us before we get there, we stand a pretty good chance. All right, men. From now on, we're on our own. Rizzie, you and I'll take the oil tank. When that goes, it'll be a signal to blow up the rest of the stuff. Mac, take the ammunition dump. Take one man with you. Aye, aye, sir. Let's see. - Hey. - Okay, Oliver, let's go. Hammond, you take the gasoline drums. - Take these two men and Johnson with you. - Aye, aye, sir. That's it. Give me the tape. Time them. Well, what is it? It takes them about 70 seconds to make the rounds, sir. - I can make it. Cover me. - Right. Halt! Fire one. Fire two. Keep her down. Stand by. Fire five. Fire six. - Drop your guns here. Mac, get these men back to the boat. - Aye, aye, sir. I thought I told you to get back to the boat. You've only got five minutes. - I know, sir. But what about- - Get going! Aye, aye, sir. - What are you doing here? - I don't like crowds, sir. There's no more ammunition, sir. Come on. Let's go. That was the chief, sir. - McDonnell, come on! - Okay, Mr. Stewart, I'm coming! - Mac! - Go ahead. I'll be right with you. Where's McDonnell? Can you swim underwater? No, but I'm learning right now, sir. - Where's Mr. Stewart? - He's on shore with Mac and Oliver, sir. - We can't wait. Stand by to dive, Brownie. - Aye, aye, sir. There they are, sir. - Hold it, Brownie! - Aye, aye, sir. Give 'em a hand. Where's McDonnell? We won't have to wait for him, sir. Everybody below! Get set, Brownie. We're going down. - The eyes are gone. We'll have to stay on the surface. - We're a dead fish if we do. Let's go below. Prepare to dive her, Brownie. Brownie, don't dive her. The captain's up on the bridge. Tell Mr. Stewart to take over and take her down to 30 feet. I'll be your periscope till we get out of the harbor. Captain, this is Mr. Stewart. I'm not gonna dive her while you're up- - Take her down 30 feet. - But- That's an order, Mr. Stewart. Aye, aye, sir. Take her down to 30 feet and level off. Thirty feet. - Thirty feet. Hold her there. - Aye, aye, sir. Are you all right, Captain? I'm all right. Steady as you go. - Steady as you go. - 170, sir. We're on 170, Captain. Are three and four ready for firing? - Three and four ready? - Three and four ready, sir. - Three and four ready, Captain. - Come right to 195. - Come right to 195. - Right to 195. - On the course, sir. - On the course, Captain. - Stand by. - Stand by. - Stand by. - Fire three. - Fire three. - Fire three. Three fired, sir. - What about four, Captain? - You can save it. They won't need it. - Come back to 170. - Come left to 170. Left to 170. - On the course, sir. - On course, Captain. You're pretty wet. You'd better slip this on. Thanks, Brownie. - All ahead full. - All ahead full. All ahead full. Motor room reports all ahead full, sir. We're heading for the net. Brace yourself, men. We're gonna crash the net. All hands stand by. We're crashing the net. We've cleared the net, and we're on our way. Pretty wet up here. Bring me up a few feet. - See if you can hold her at 25 feet. - Twenty-five feet. We're hit topside. Captain! Captain! Blow safety! Get us up fast! Come on, Brownie. Riley, Follette, come topside. Come on, men. Bear a hand. Get him up in a sitting position. Easy does it. Hey, Doc, get the first-aid kit. Griff, give me a lift. I've got him. - What is it,Jack? - It's only a flesh wound, sir... but it's pretty deep. Hey, anybody got a cigarette? Here you are, Captain. You'd better paste that back in, Ward. Gonna lose it. Well, don't stand there like an undertaker. Open the door. Hey! Easy with the rice. They're liable to ration that. - How are you, darling? - Congratulations, my boy. - Thank you, Uncle Bob. - I told you. I warned you. Serves you right. Oh, Butch. Congratulations, Stinky. You don't deserve her. Uncle Bob, excuse me. I want you to know my new executive officer. - My dear. - Here, here. Look out. He's another of them. They're all wolves in this family. Uh,just a minute. Oh, Stinky, leave the poor girl alone. Come on! I want to know how he sold you this bill of goods. Well, you're back not only with a broom at the masthead... but with a bride by your side. Uncle Bob, I'm certainly glad that you ordered me to New London. I take it you're now a confirmed submarine man. Well, sir, yes and no. You'd rather go back to the P.T. boats? Well, uh, no and yes. Now, can't you chart a little more definite course? I think so, sir. The P.T. boats are swell. They do a grand job... and they'll play their part in winning the war... but not without the submarines. They've got their job to do in all the seven seas... and, boy, how they're doing it. And the carriers that bring the planes... that drop the bombs that sink the enemy ships. And the cruisers that protect the airplane carriers. And the battleships- the dreadnoughts and super dreadnoughts- the big shots of the fleet. They're in there punching too. They're all in there doing theirjob, working together. I found that out, sir. It isn't one branch of the service. It's all branches. And it isn't all ships. It's men. The men behind the guns of the P. T. boats... and the submarines, and the Coast Guard ships... and the mine layers and the tenders... and the tankers and the troop ships. The men that take them out... that fight their way over and land them there. That's the Navy- the United States Navy.
