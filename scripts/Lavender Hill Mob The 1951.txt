The president himself told my husband it was the occasion of the year. Oh, senora. I was going to send you this for your subscription list. The, uh, victims of the revolution. Perhaps I may be allowed to give it to you now. Thank you, senor. Always so generous. Oh. The wife of Martin Gallardo, the frozen meat king. Very decent couple. Oh, excuse me. Manuel? Pity you can't stay till sunday. I've got a horse in the Jockey Club stakes. You... Rode... A very good race. A very good race. Racing's not quite straight out here. Still, I do believe I've helped to raise the standard a little. Ah, Chiquita! Chiquita! I hoped I'd see you. Mm. You run along and get yourself that little birthday present. Oh, but how sweet of you. Thank you! You seem to have accomplished quite a lot in one year. One superb year. Just when I was beginning to believe I'd never achieve it. For 20 years, I've dreamed of a life like this. For 19 of those years, fate denied me the one contact... Essential to the success of all my plans. Still, I never quite lost sight of the goal. Inaccessible as it often seemed to me... When I was merely a... Merely a nonentity... Among all those thousands who flock every morning into the city. Most men who long to be rich know inwardly that they will never achieve their ambition. But I was in the unique position of having a fortune literally within my grasp. For it was my job to supervise the deliveries of bullion... From the gold refinery to the bank. - Lucky I saw that. - Yes, very lucky. Mr. Richards, with gold at 240 shillings per fine ounce, That particle, estimating its value at, uh, .025, Would entail a loss of approximately six shillings. Well, I've got a bit more out here for you to check. One hundred gold bars, weighed to the value of 495,987! Well, Mr. Richards, your deposit... Will be returned in the usual way, as soon as the gold enters the bank. You are both armed? I was well aware they all ridiculed me for the way I fussed and worried. That was precisely what I had striven for years to achieve. Here we go again. There's a car been following us. - That one, sir? - No, of course not. A black Chrysler, THX-375. It's gone on ahead. No sign of it now, sir. It's probably waiting for us around the next corner. Go and have a look... and leave me your gun, meanwhile. Nobody could say that my precautions were not fully justified. Many a rascal would have risked his all for half a million, Not realizing that gold, in the form of bullion, Is useless without a method of smuggling it abroad. To find that method was my last remaining problem. Come in. Meanwhile, I gave the bank their gold. - Oh, thanks, Holland. Everything quite in order? - Yes, sir. Silly question. Twenty years, and nothing's ever been out of order yet. Er, that will do, Holland. Why don't you give that poor old devil a chance? Surely, after all this time, he deserves a leg up. Oh, I'm afraid it wouldn't work, sir. His one and only virtue is honesty. He has no imagination, no initiative, sir. I was a potential millionaire. Yet I had to be satisfied with eight pounds, fifteen shillings, less deductions. A weekly reminder that the years were passing, And my problem still unsolved. Until my ship came home, I was obliged to live... At the Balmoral private hote in Lavender Hill. Ah, Holland! The man of millions. What did you get away with today? Got any spare ingots for an old pal? You'll be the death of me, Holland! I sincerely trust so. Ah, Mr. Holland. Always punctual. I smell oxtail soup again. Oh, dear. Now, let's see. Where did we get? Duke Milligan was about to take a gander at Nicky the Greek's hideout. Oh, yes. Now, here we are. "I handed my fedora to a hat-check girl... "with all that Venus de Milo had got, and then more, "and I was admiring the more when I glimmed something... "in the back of this frail that set my underwear... Creeping up on me like it had legs." I know that feeling well. "A guy had soft-shoed out of the door from the gaming room... "as quiet as a snake on tip-belly. "and I didn't need my case history of smiling Ed Montana... To know that Sonny boy was his number-one triggerman, Ricci the Filipino." I thought it was little boy Schultz who carried the rod for Mr. Montana. It was, Mrs. Chalk. But surely you remember? Montana found Schultz taking liberties with that redhead. Yes, yes. They took him for a ride. Only last night, wasn't it? Oh, I must be getting old. Read on, Mr. Holland. "If ever I felt like putting up a new high for the mile of the century, This was the time." "And then I thought again of those 10,000 smackeroos..." Yes? Mr. Holland, you're not concentrating. So sorry. Evesham must be upstairs. - Good evening. - Good evening. Tricky business, this moving, isn't it? - You've got a lot of stuff here. - Yeah. Can I give you a hand? Oh, that's very civil of you. My name's Pendlebury. Holland. Yeah. If you wouldn't mind taking "motherhood"... Good evening, Mr. Pendlebury. Welcome to Balmoral. How very nice to see you. Oh! Mr. Pendlebury! I knew you were an artistic gentleman, but really! - Take all this. - Oh! Thank you. I thought I'd made myself quite plain when I phoned, miss Evesham. I'd... I'd no idea it would mean... But there's no place to put it all! - What about the stable? - I suppose it could go there. Mind your toes, miss Evesham. Back shortly, Mrs. Chalk. Oh, this is capital. Capital! A ready-made studio! A thing I wanted all my life. Why, it's even got a north light, too. Mr. Pendlebury, just one moment. The terms of my lease... Oh, I say! Steady, steady, steady. So sorry. Oh, it's all right. I had to g... had to cast her in gilding metal. It's a little delicate, you know? Mr. Pendlebury... I did it in my factory. You must see it one of these days. Mr. Pendlebury! Ooh, these walls! Oh, an admirable background for my canvases. Mr. Pendlebury! Let me inform you here and now... That no business occupation may be performed on these premises. Oh-ho, my dear lady. This is not my business occupation. I wish it were. No, these are my wings. My escape after the cares of the day are over. My business occupation is something unspeakably hideous. I'm in the "Presents from" trade. You know, "Presents from Brighton," "Souvenir of Tunbridge Wells." Yes, if tourists only realized, they could save themselves a lot of luggage space... By applying to us direct for their holiday memories. And the irony of it, Holland, the irony is... I must design them all myself. I propagate british cultural depravity. Look at this. Anne hathaway's cottage... for keeping string in. Wouldn't you infinitely prefer the comparative purity of an old biscuit tin? Southend pier! Oh, I... I've thought for years to cut loose from it all, But I never had the courage. "Of all sad words of tongue or pen, "the saddest are these: 'It might have been'". Forgive me. Come and see the casting room. We're busy at present on one of our export lines. Paperweights. We ship a thousand a week over to France. Here's a little... speciality. Quite a simple process, really. Pour the molten lead into the mold, allow it to harden. As soon as it's cool, it's sprayed with gold paint... And then it's ready to be shipped to France. "Slave, I have set my life upon a cast." Richard III. I believe it's turning into a self-portrait. I shall call him "the slave." Oh, my dear Holland, I'm so sorry. You're still feeling bad. The heat of that place. I always forget. No, it wasn't the heat. I'm used to that in my job. Oh, really? Your place is very similar to a refinery. Really? I had no idea. We turn gold into bars, you turn lead into Eiffel Towers. That's the only difference. Only! If I had gold to deal with... - Yes? - Ah, an idle dream. - Must be a big responsibility. - No, not really. If anyone did rob our van, well, it's virtually impossible to dispose of stolen bullion, In this country, at any rate. Yes. Oh, yes, I imagine so. But if it could be smuggled abroad... What a hope. Well, I wouldn't say it's out of the question. Saying one had the means of melting the stuff down. In the kitchen stove? What a job. Oh, of course not. It would mean taking on a partner. Ah, Risky. Bringing other people in. That would be essential, in any case. No one person could rob our van unaided. You mean, he'd need accomplices? Precisely. A gang. A gang? Not so easy to come by. Oh, I don't know. With gold sitting on the continental black market... At two and a half times its standard price? I mean, quite a few people would be willing to chance an arm for half a million. Yes, but how... How would you get your gold across to the continent? Well. Supposing one had the right sort of partner, In the form of, uh, shall we say... Eiffel Tower paperweights? By Jove, Holland, it's a good job. We are both honest men. It is indeed, Pendlebury. Come in. Oh, there you are, Holland. Come in and sit down. Well, Holland, you've been quite the subject of discussion lately. Don't look so worried, man. I've managed to persuade the chief cashier to give you a leg up. A leg up, sir? Promotion. You're going up to foreign exchange. No more uncomfortable journeys in that dreary van. But, sir... now, now, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Don't bother to thank me, man. I told abercrombie that you can start with him next monday. - But I can't, sir! - Why not? Because, um... Because... I'm too old to change my views now, sir. Ah, one's never too old to better oneself. Think what you can do with an extra 15 shillings a week! But sir, I like the bullion office. It holds all I ever wished for. The trouble with you, Holland, if I may speak frankly, Is that you haven't enough ambition. When a good opportunity comes along, grab it with both hands! It may not occur again. Very good, sir. I'll follow your advice. So it's now or never. Friday's delivery. This week. Three days to go. Two desperadoes to find. - Bait. - Bait? I said, bait. Trap 'em! Mr. Pendlebury? - Hello, Mr. Pendlebury! - Hello! Why, good evening. Ha! By Jove, what a bit of luck! Just the man I wanted to see. What's the trouble? That safe in my office. Something's gone wrong with the lock. I'll send a man round tomorrow. I wish you would. It worries me a little, Leaving the staff wages there overnight. You know the address: "Gewgaws, limited." "Gewgaws, limited." You know, the back of rathbing place, there. Fancy leaving all that money there. Why, anybody could break into the place tonight, And help themselves! Come on, number five! You've done it. Stay there, me beauty, stay there! One never knows. Somebody may have been listening. I suggest we give them till midnight. - Where are those guns? - Guns? Yes. It's essential that we're armed. Here they are. Here's yours. Is it loaded? Yes. It's a present from Margate. It fires a stick of rock. The safe's in the office, over there. You squeeze behind that bench, and surprise anyone making for the safe. I'm going over here, to prevent an escape through the packing room. Ready? - What's that? - Cramp. - What? - Pins and needles. Reach for it. Don't shoot, Guv. Don't shoot. I won't give no trouble. Please don't be 'ard on me. I got a wife and six kids. I never done nothing like this before. - Is that true? - Yes, Guv. I'm on the level. May I drop dead if I lie. I been honest all me life. It was just the temptation. - This is your first crime? - Yes, Guv. I swear it. And I'll never go wrong no more. Suppose we asked you to do a job for us. I'd do it. That's all I want. A chance to turn an honest penny. Well, supposing it wasn't exactly an honest penny. Careful now, careful. We don't want anyone who's going straight. In any case, we need someone far bigger. Mm. Such as me? Who are you? Who are you? Oh, take those things away. I'm not hungry. Name of Lackery Wood. Otherwise known as Sawdust Steve, the wandsworth boy. Two convictions for 'ousebreaking, one for larceny of the person. Total 18 months only, in 10 years' work. Here you are... some cuttings, if you'd like to see 'em. How long have you been here? Just long enough to hide when I heard you comin' in. Thought I'd been taken for a mug! Me! What's the job? Useful. Never worked nothing else but single-handed. Sensible. Very sensible. Just the same meself. Kept on me Jack Jones ever since Nobby Curtis got me done... - For that job at Bellamy's. - Bellamy's in Bromley? That's right. Last June, twelve month. I was casing that joint... The night you got pinched! Well, what do you know? I'm shorty fisher. Ah, nice to have met ya. Excuse me, I... I may be slow, but do I understand... That you two are, in fact, Both professional criminals? What else do you take us for? Ruddy snoopers? What's the setup? Just a moment, Pendlebury. We require a team, And if these two gentlemen insist on working alone... Wait a minute. You make it worth our while, cock, we'll work in with the band of hope. Eh, shorty? You said it. Well, in that case, if you would both join us in the office, My friend Mr. Holland will outline what we have in mind. I must apologize, gentlemen, for the somewhat informal manner... In which we effected our introduction. But my colleague and I have a certain proposition... Which we'd like to put to you. I might almost call it a "gilt-edged proposition," Although, paradoxically, it does entail a measure of risk. However, when I quote the anticipated dividend, I'm sure that you will both agree with me that the... Not another one, surely. Tell him we're suited. - Everything all right here, sir? - Yes, thank you, officer. My, uh, my partner and I are busy stock-taking. - Only I saw the window open, you see? - Oh, yes, yes. I'll close it. Thank you very much. Good night, officer. Good night, sir. And, um, here's the order for tomorrow's consignment. Somewhat larger than I expected: 212 bars. That won't worry me, sir. Dependable to the last. I'm going to miss you, Holland. You're very kind, sir. I shall always have the happiest memories of the dear old bullion office. Has Mr. Abercrombie spoken to you about your holiday? Yes, sir. I'm going to Paris. Paris, eh? You're stepping out, Holland. Wonderful, isn't it, what a little extra money will do. Yes. It's going to make a big difference to me. Oh! Have a go-round out on your own now. Thank you, mate. That's it. And how are you getting on? No, you must show some sense of proportion. Look at that seagull. It's bigger than the funnel. - Can't I do something else, Guv? - Sell matches, or boot laces. No, no. Mr. Holland specified a pavement artist, And a pavement artist it's got to be. Come on, try again. It's coming slowly. You're teaching the wrong man. Well, I had to change them over. Shorty can't ride a bicycle. Doesn't look as if he can, either. We're learnin' him. Why couldn't you Learn shorty? Because Lackery's color-blind. - What's that got to do with it? - Oh, my dear Holland, Do use your intelligence; if a policeman were to come along and see a green sunset... Over a purple sea... all right, all right. Spare me the details. - Is everything else fixed? - Yes, the map's in the office. Come along, this is the setup. Uh, Mr. Fisher will be sitting here. The van will stop in front of him at 4:30. A minute later, the guard will appear round this corner, And you, Pendlebury, will detain him for at least half a minute. Ask him for a light, ask him anything, but keep him there. We must have those 30 seconds. Edgar! I beg your pardon? Isn't one supposed to say that when one's being briefed? On my rare visits to the kinema... the word is "Roger." Oh, Roger! How silly of me. To continue. As soon as we've captured the van, Mr. Wood and Mr. Pendlebury... Will proceed straight to the warehouse. Bit risky, isn't it? Making Mr. Pendlebury go there, after the guard's seen him? It's a risk we must take. We need everyone. We've more than 200 bars to move, and I must have my alibi. You've got to gag me, bind me, tear my clothes, roll me in the dust. We can't afford to waste one second. Okay. You're the boss. Yes. Yes, that's right. I am. Two hundred and eleven, Two hundred and twelve. Ah, Mr. Richards. Your deposit will be returned in the usual way... As soon as the gold enters the bank. Uh, you're both, uh... Hoi! Hoi! - Here, no you don't. - Don't what? I saw you pinch it. Good gracious, whatever must you think of me. I think you're the bloke what pinched my "monarch of the glen" last week. Oh, no, I assure you. Pinch a landseer, me? Well, you better come quiet. - If you'll have five minutes' patience, I'll explain. - Five minutes? Oi, Charlie, get on the blower. Come on, come along with me. He's picked a wrong one this time. No, no, no! It's all a ghastly mistake, officer. I'm completely innocent. - Did you see that car? - Yes, sir. Police car. What? Nothing to be afraid of there, sir. Bloke was a copper. I... It's some trick. I'm sure it's the same car that followed us the other day. - You want me to go and look round the corner, sir? - Yes. It's all a mistake, officer. You got a flat tire there, mate! Help! Help! - Help! Help! Police! - What's happened? The van! They've pinched the van! What's this? Our van. Stolen. Load of bullion. Kidnapped the boss. Hoi! Stop, thief! Hoi! Stop, thief! Hello, M2GW, from one-four. Urgent me... Urgent message begins. Maroon-colored van, LKL238, containing bull... Containing bullion, value one million pounds, Believed stolen in the vicinity of Queen Victoria Street. Hello, all cars from M2GW. Message number 4-8 begins. Maroon-colored van, LKL638, Containing bullion, value one million pounds, Stolen from the vicinity of Queen Victoria Street. Cor, what a weight! The others will be here soon. Hoi! Hoi, shorty. - They got Mr. Pendlebury. The cops, of course! - Who has? I saw a crowd down there. The driver of the van's there. There's two cops, and they're holding him. Will he grass? Will he squeal? Will he split? No. Then it don't matter. We can deliver the stuff as arranged. We don't need him. Come on. Sergeant Wilson, you take your men and search... The east end of the street, moving down towards the center. Sergeant Cripps, you take the west end and move down here to meet Sergeant Wilson. Rose, come with me. We'd better have a look at those warehouses. That's all right. Leave the rest. Blimey, guv'nor, why? Help my alibi. Turn it up, Guv. There's 75,000 quid in there. I said, leave it. A ruddy waste. There's many a starving bloke'd be glad of that lot. Come on, now. Fix me up. No, behind you. Left-hand pocket. Well, stand still. What's that? You turn. It's easier. Other way. Okay. Hey! Look! Hey. Hey! - Come on! Scram! - Wait! Wait! Mess me up! Mr. Fisher! Mr. Wood! Mess me up! It's essential! Wait! Wait! Wait! Stop! Wait! You can't leave me like this. Wait. Wait, stop. Help! Help! Help! Can you see from down there? Help! Sir! Inspector Talbot! Sir! - I'll get you! - Fight going on over there. Purely an oversight, officer. I had something on my mind. Three pictures in a week I missed from there. You can't accuse him of taking those others, too. I should think not. I'm no thief, officer. My character's an open book. Well? Well, you might as well know. I was lying. I am a thief. It was madness to attempt it. We weren't cut out for crime, either of us. We? My partner and i. Your partner? If you're working with a fence who's got them other pictures... Shh. Carry on. Oh, I make no excuses. All my life it's been my ambition to surround myself with rare and beautiful things. Suddenly faced with this golden opportunity... here. You call that picture of mine rare and beautiful? Since you will keep on interrupting me, you ought to know... It's a charming example of an early rochet, While he was still under the influence of Corot. Oh, yeah. How much is it worth? Ten pounds, to those who can afford it. Oh, Blimey. I've got it marked up at five Bob. - Here, what about this charge? - Let him go. I've got to get back before they sell that picture! Your lucky day, it seems. All right. Case dismissed. Off you go. Yes, about five minutes ago. Who, sir? Oh, yes, we've got him, all right. He's here now, giving us a statement. Yes, he's told us quite a lot already. Go on. Hop it. Yes. Yes, you can depend on that, sir. We'll get all we can out of him. I see. Yes, he stood it pretty well. Yes, we'll look after him all right, sir. We're fixing him up with some dry clothes now. Yes, I agree, sir. We're up against some very tough customers. - Here, what are you doin'? - They'll have to put a new floor in. He'll be able to afford it. Get on with the job. You make me sick. What's happened? She only just made it. Here! I thought you was pinched. No, it's Holland they've got. Holland? I was in the police station when they brought him in, under arrest. - You sure of that? - Of course I'm sure! He was all dripping wet. There were two policemen holding him. They must have seen everything. We gotta blow. Nah, wait a minute. Can they connect you with him? I don't know. We both live at the same house, but... The map! What? The map showing the route from here to the warehouse. - Holland took it home with him. - Now we are done for. No, we're not. You finish the job. Come on. Where to? Your place. If they ain't searched his room yet. Too late. Helmets in the hall. You'll have to go in alone, Guv. Might be somebody I know. But they're there already. They're still a chance they haven't found it yet. Go on, get weaving. But surely you must have some suspicion. Who work the hoist rackets in this territory? Beg pardon, lady? Oh, really, I can't make myself much plainer. Which hoodlums around here specialize in toby jobs? Holland! Pendlebury! Determination, pluck and fortitude worthy of the highest praise. Come along, now. We mustn't keep him waiting. Star, news or standard! Star, news or standard! Star, news or standard! Now! Pretty, isn't it? I could watch it all night. Three pence an ounce up again today. "Gold is the sovereign of all sovereigns". Proverb. Holland... Holland! These plain-sided crates are filled with the lead towers made by the daytime staff. They must never be touched. This "R" stands for "reserve stock." These crates will remain in our Paris warehouse. I've sent instructions to our young lady over there, she's never to use anything... From a crate marked "R" till I give the authority. So, these are the ones I work on. Exactly. Get rid of the contents and refill with, um... How long do you think it'll all take? Oh, I estimate about two weeks here. And then a week in Paris, To find our market, then three months back here till it all blows over... That'll bring us to the end of the year... an excellent time to retire. Blimey, you're not going to the bank after the stuff's left the country, are you? Certainly. It would look most suspicious if I gave up my job immediately. Ah-ha. "Patience is a virtue." Shakespeare. Our firstborn. Oh, yes. That's the man you describe in your statement... As having a snake tattooed on his wrist. Uh, yes. Oh, and I should mention that, uh, one of them had a distinct foreign accent. Come on, china! Get weaving! Scotland Yard are searching the Rogues' Gallery... In the hunt for the criminals, and helping them is the bank clerk hero... Plucky little Holland. There is no doubt that this robbery is the work of a mastermind. The police of every county have instructions to leave... No stone unturned in their nationwide search. Every possible clue is being investigated, However small and unimportant it may appear on the surface. The yard are confident of ultimate success, Because anyone who traffics in stolen gold... will find it's too hot to handle. Scientific research reinforces the man on the beat. All the big guns are on the side of the law. Link by link, A chain of cast iron evidence is forged. Men who might be able to assist the police in their inquiries... Are being sought in all likely hideouts. It is expected that a charge will be made within 24 hours. Meanwhile, the yard chiefs continue to work in calm and imperturbable harmony. A spirit of complete confidence prevails. The gold has Not left the country. Ach! I hope you're right. If it has, we'll never see one grain of it again. Ports are being watched as they've never been watched before. We're counting the matchsticks. Gewgaws, limited. Souvenir models, Eiffel Tower in lead... Okay. As usual. And in view of rising public anxiety, Can he assure the house that this very large sum of money... is not irretrievably lost to the nation? Yes, sir, I think I may give that assurance. Measures have been taken which render it virtually impossible... For any substantial quantity of gold to be removed from this country. Souvenir de la Tour Eiffel, en plomb. Oui. Ca va? Ca va. Bon. this time tomorrow where shall I be  not in this old found-a-ry  Now that it's all over, I suppose I may dare say... It's been a most remarkable coup. The biggest job since One-Eyed Dobson got away with the G.I.'s pay packets. Two million dollars, Grosvenor Square, '45. That was before devaluation, and this is one million pounds. Well, that's right. Blimey. We got the record! Is that you, Lackery? - What's the matter? - Trouble. Nothing serious, I hope. I can't go. - Why not? - The missus won't let me. Can't-can't you say it's in connection with an important business deal? I told her. She won't wear it. Birmingham, Glasgow, Manchester... Bob's your bloomin' uncle. - Paris? - No. You know we can't pay you till we get to Paris? I'll settle for a half a dozen of these. I know a safe fence. - Out of the question! - Are you mad? Leave vital evidence on this side of the channel? Why, if anything went wrong, the police would be on to us in no time. Ah, you can't ask a thing like that, mate. I suppose. I'm sorry, Guv. I wasn't thinking. I'm a little upset. Here! I'll tell you what! I didn't like to say so, but I don't really fancy goin' to Paris meself. Why? A friend of mine, he pinched a couple of tickets... For the test match, see? I wouldn't half like to see that. Right! Now, you're both coming straight back here once you've flogged the stuff. Okay, just smuggle our money over inside your socks. I'll lend you a false-bottom bag! You mean, you both trust us? Oh, come off it, Guv. You're as straight a pair of gentlemen... - As I ever worked for. - Hear, hear! Well, that seems an excellent solution. Thank you, boys. Just let me nail this down... I've got a little surprise for you all. for days of auld lang syne  for auld lang syne, my dears  for auld lang syne  we'll take a cup of kindness yet  for days of auld lang syne  Work it up to me. Here. Good. Come on. Shh! You naughty men. Waking us all up at this hour. A thousand pardons. Wipe your feet. A little celebration. Already? Your holidays don't start until tomorrow. Today is tomorrow. "Oh, polished perturbation! Golden care! Shh! Shh! That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide!" Henry IV, part two. Good night, you naughty men. Don't forget to switch off! Night, miss Evesham. Pendlebury? Yeah. Pendlebury? What? May I call you alfred? Alfred? Call me Al. And I'll call you... Henry, isn't it? A name I never cared for. Mm-mm? No. Mm... Call me "Dutch." Dutch. Yes! Good night, dutch. Good night... Al. Mm. "Ah, gay, sprightly land of mirth and social ease." Holland, the world is ours. Look, you'll lose your hat if you're not careful. Our train leaves in twenty minutes! Un souvenir de Paris avant de partir, no? Ah, madame! Oh, mais bonjour, monsieur Pendlebury. Thank you. My friend, Mr. Holland. Ah, monsieur! Enchante. How do you do? How did that get here? I told you never to use a crate marked "R". But that is not an "ah", monsieur, it is an "air". It's an "R" in english! How many have you sold from that case? Six, monsieur. To the little english girls. Don't sell any more! I'll be back. Wait! Stop! Stop! Wait! Come on! Stop! Wait! Wait! Wait, dutch, wait! What do we care? We've still got all the others. We mustn't let them get back to England! We'll be traced! Who's to know they're gold? We can't afford to take any chances! Dutch! Wait! Dutch! Wait for me! There's nothing to laugh at. Stop! Wait! Taxi! Hey! Hey! Suivez. Suivez! Vos billets, s'il vous plait. Calais! Non, vous etes trop tard. Le train pour calais est deja parti. No. Come on. It's no good. The train has gone. Get the rest out of the warehouse and disappear with them. With half the police in the world looking for us? To Calais. Calais! The warehouse. Oh, face the facts, man! You'll have to change your plan. Rubbish. It's a perfect plan. - What's the french for "faster"? - I'm not gonna tell you. For heaven's sake. Do you want to be a hunted man all your life? - Darlings, you have a good time in Paris? - Yes. Yes. Did you all enjoy yourselves? There they are! Vos billets, s'il vous plait.

He never told me. Have you his address? I haven't. I'm sorry. He didn't know where he'd be staying. I see. All right. Thank you. Pleased to be of help. Why, Mr. Holland? What is the meaning of this? Transport strike in Paris made things too difficult. And Mr. Pendlebury, is he with you? He's flying back tomorrow. He had some important business to see to. - You have dined, I hope. - I'm afraid not. Oh! Good evening. Oh. Good evening, inspector. It's bad luck about your holiday. It is, isn't it? Should have informed us you were going abroad. You're our most important witness. Oh. So sorry. Anything I can do? We've traced four vans... Seen near the warehouse at the time of the robbery. It's just possible you may have got a glimpse of one. Um, a blue van with the name "loveday and bone" on the side. No. It all happened so quickly. They never gave me a chance. Well, you never know. A white van. "The blackheath spotless laundry." No, I'm afraid not. Another blue one. "The spring song mattress company". No. Uh, as I told you... A green van. "Gewgaws, limited". Does that ring a bell? No. It was definitely none of them. You can't say that for certain if you didn't see it, can you? Ha. Silly of me. Thank you very much. You'll be available now if we want you again? Good night, Mr. Holland. Good night, inspector. John, how lovely to see you. Dutch! Hello there. Nice of you to come and meet me. I took the crates back to the warehouse... how well you're looking. Say nothing. Just smile. What did you say? Nothing like a change I always say. Smile now. The police may be watching. The police? Ha. They suspect your van was involved. Oh! I told you it was madness to come back. Good thing we did. This makes it more important we get hold of those towers. Oh, I was a fool to let you persuade me. You're acting like a fool now. Suspicions aren't evidence. Once we get those out of reach... We've got to get Ourselves out of their reach. I'm going after those towers. Are you? Well, I'm going back to Paris. Very well. But remember, if I fail, you're for it too. Did you trace those girls Yes. St. Christopher's school, Hendon. Come on.

Shh. Sit down girls. These gentlemen are from the firm that makes the Eiffel Tower models... That some of you bought in Paris. It appears that, by a mistake, you were sold a new experimental type... Which they're anxious to have back. They'll exchange them for others equally good. Also... and I consider this most generous... They will give ten shillings... To each girl who helps them in this way. Here you are. And for you. There's yours. And that's for you. Thank you. One, two, three, four, five. Only five. Who bought the sixth one? Who bought the sixth? June Edwards bought one. You have one, too, have you dear? Where is it, June? In here? Now, don't be silly, June, dear. Wouldn't you like to have ten shillings... Another one just as nice? Oh, come, come. Think of all the sweeties you could buy with this. There we are. Just as pretty, isn't it? Really, June. Look at them together and you'll see. There's no difference, is there? Now, come on. Tell us. What's the difference? That one is mine. Well, I'm sorry. I can't force the child to give it up. - Does the odd one really matter? - Indeed, it does, madam. Were it to fall into the hands of... a business rival... Yes. But that won't happen. We've kept you too long as it is. Thank you very much. But, but I... but... what? Oh. That's interesting. I bought a pyramid stud box in Cairo during the war. I suppose that was made here too. I suspect so. We send stuff all over the world. Just finished, sir. Good. You don't keep a record of where the van goes? Anyone takes the blooming thing when they feel like it. Away for a week, just recently, it was. No recollection of who had it that particular afternoon? Well... I've an idea it was the boss. Mr. Pendlebury. Mr. Pendlebury. But I'm not really sure, and I can't ask him 'cause he's away in Paris. In Paris? Oh, well. Thanks. All right. Hendon. But, dutch, robbing a child... It won't be robbing her. It'll simply be a swap.
