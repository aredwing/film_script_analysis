I'll tell you what it could be. - Ahhh! - Oh! The Gruffalo said that... No Gruffalo should ever set foot in the deep, dark wood. Why not? Why not? Oh! Because, if you do, the Big Bad Mouse will be after you. I met him once. Said the Gruffalo. I met him a long, long time ago. What does he look like? Tell us, Dad. Is he terribly big and terribly bad? Um... I can't quite remember. The Gruffalo said. Then he thought for a minute... and scratched his head. The Big Bad Mouse... ...is terribly strong. Terribly strong? And his scaly tail is terribly long. Terribly long? His eyes are like pools of terrible fire. Terrible fire. And his terrible whiskers are tougher than wire. Tougher than wire? The Big Bad Mouse... ...is terribly strong. And his scaly tail is terribly long. His eyes are like pools of terrible fire and his terrible whiskers are tougher than wire. The Big Bad Mouse. One snowy night when the Gruffalo snored... ...the Gruffalo's child was feeling bored. The Gruffalo's child was feeling brave so she tiptoed out of the Gruffalo cave. The snow fell fast and the wind blew wild. Into the wood went the Gruffalo's child. Oh! A- ha! O-ho! A trail in the snow. Whose is this trail? And where does it go? A tail poked out of a log-pile house. Could this be the tail... ...of the Big Bad Mouse? Out slid the creature. Hmmm! Oh. His eyes are small. And he doesn't have whiskers. No, none at all! You're not the mouse! Not I. Said the snake. But he's down by the lake... Ah! ...Eating Gruffalo cake. Oh! Woooo! Urgh! Oh! The snow fell fast and the wind blew wild. I'm not scared. Said the Gruffalo's child. A- ha. O- ho! Marks in the snow. Whose are these claw marks? Where do they go? Sshh! Two eyes gleamed out of a treetop house. Could these be the eyes of the Big Bad Mouse? Down flew the creature. His tail is short... and he doesn't have whiskers of any sort. Ow! Oof! You're not the Mouse. Too-whit, too-whoo! Not I. But he's somewhere nearby. Eating... Gruffalo pie! Oh... Aah! The snow fell fast and the wind blew wild. I'm not scared. Said the Gruffalo's child. And then? Hmmm. A- ha! O- ho. A track in the snow. Whose is this track? And where does it go? Whiskers at last, and an underground house. Could this be the home of the Big Bad Mouse? Waah! Out slunk the creature. His eyes aren't fiery. His tail isn't scaly. His whiskers aren't wiry. Ah... Achoo! Oh! You're not the Mouse! Aaah! Gruffalo! You're not the Mouse. Mouse? Oh! Oh, no, not me. He's, er... He's under a tree! Er, drinking... ...Gruffalo tea. Ha ha. Ha... ah! It's all a trick. Said the Gruffalo's child as she sat on a stump where the snow lay piled. I don't believe in the Big Bad Mouse. But here comes a little one out of his house. Mmm, not big... not bad... but a mouse at least. You'll taste good as a midnight feast. Aah! Wait... wait! Said the Mouse. Before you eat... There's... a... friend of mine... that you ought to meet. Mmm? If you let me hop on to a... ...hazel twig... I'll beckon my friend... so bad and big. The Gruffalo's child unclenched her fist. The Big Bad Mouse? So he does exist? Mmm. The Mouse hopped into the hazel tree. He beckoned, then said... Just wait and see. Out came the moon. It was bright and round. A terrible shadow fell onto the ground. Who is this creature so big, bad and strong? His tail and his whiskers are terribly long! His ears are enormous and over his shoulder... ...he carries a nut as big as a boulder! The Big Bad Mouse! Yelled the Gruffalo's child. Ha ha. Ooh! The Mouse! Mmm. The Mouse jumped down from the twig and smiled. Ugh! A- ha! O-ho. Prints in the snow. Whose are these footprints? Where do they go? THE BIG BAD MOUSE! Owl. Ha. The Big Bad Mouse. The footprints led to the Gruffalo cave where the Gruffalo's child was a bit less brave. The Gruffalo's child was a bit less bored. And the Gruffalo snored... ...and snored... ...and snored. Huh?
