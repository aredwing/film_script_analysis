Today's headline says... ...another victim of the serial killer found in the canal. Let's see... what's the police would say. Here... it's said the detective pointed out.

Put your hands above your head!!! Spread your legs!!! They are used clothes. I'm taking them to the laundry. Then why did you run? I don't know... I guess it's just city people's instinct.

Hey... that's hurt. What is the crazy old woman doing? Why doesn't she come out and chase us away? Maybe she's doing some ritual. Let's go in and check it out? I don't think so. I mean... can you imagine if she caught us? We are dead meat. What are you afraid of? There are 5 of us here. So... 5 of us... last time I saw, we all ran away every time. Here... your food. Come eat with me, Tong my boy. Why don't you eat? Oh! Do you want me to sing for you first? Look!! We can't even handle her... ...and now it's another ghost? I think we'd better go. Don't scare us!! We definitely need to rescue her from her insanity. Go to hell!!! Come on out!!! Oh! No! Here she comes. Go away!!! Leave me alone!!! A man... to be known. Greatest accomplishments have shown... Yes... yes papa. How can I leave now? Semester ends doesn't mean I don't have to go to school. I thought you could come home and help at the store. I have a lot of things to do. Hold on for a second. Meng... turn off the television. Why would I lie to you? Okay... okay... but don't forget to call home. Yes, papa. See... I told you. She's not coming back. She's having a good time in the city. Suburban girl alone in Bangkok... By now... it would... Stop it!!! Meng... you're having an exam tomorrow, aren't you? Have you finished studying? Go... go... read your book. All right. Wait!!! Sister... one minute please. Please... just one minute. Just a little... just... please... se. I just need to mark... one more... This is unforgiven. If she didn't threaten me last night... ...I would have finished the exam. I can't believe it. How could she be so cruel? I told you!!! I told you she's evil... ...we shouldn't mess with her. Let's go and get it over with!!! I'm in!!! She should no longer be a threat to us. Yes!!! It's true. The sacred magic can't be insulted. Couples of parents over there... ...over there. Gather around and see for yourself. ...come... come closer and take a look. In year 1985, our famous singer, Sayan Sanya... ...traveled to Petchabul province to open the show. On the way back, there was an accident. A car crashed... really!! It was 7-8 turns. But it's a miracle... ladies and gentlemen. He was alive. He survived with no injury. Not even a scratch. If you're scare, you can leave now. We can do it by ourselves. What about you guys? Just wear this buddha image... ladies and gentlemen. Take a good look. Please, I need a volunteer. Anybody? How about you, children? Would you? No? Yes!! You, my boy. Now we got ourselves a brave volunteer. Come here, son. This boy... ...I don't know him personally. But first, I have to apology... ...for those who also have magical images. Please do not take this as an insult. Please pay respect. Are we ready? Ready! Music! - Abdul? Are you ready? - Yes. - Ready? - Yes. Now, his spirit has left the body. We will now remove his head. We'll do it slowly. Sacred power right before you... ...for your witness only. - Abdul? - Yes. - Follow me. - I did follow. - Follow me. - I did. - Do you know a lady? - Yes. - Do you know a man? - Yes. Then who does stand on the left-hand side? A man or a lady? A man. How did you know? By the sacred power of buddha image. Did you see that, ladies and gentlemen? You wouldn't believe it right? The boy lying in front of you... ...has the buddha image in his mouth the whole time. So not only he can predict... ...but he is also protected from all harms. Ladies and gentlemen. Five Saturns buddha image. Come on. Come and get us. Right here, you witch, I'm right here. Help! This way... witch. Come here. Peak, let's go. She's getting mad. Is she still following us?

Run!!!! Run!!! Help!! Help!!!! Nil... help me. Come on, June. June... let's move. Hurry!! Nil... Nil... help me. Go... go... go. June. Nil, help me. June... hurry... June. June. Do you think she will be alright? I guess she's all right... but I don't know how bad the injury is. How can you be so sure that she will be okay? What are you two talking about? If you don't want to watch TV... ...then go play somewhere else. It's annoying. - Let's go. - Now! Go! Seng!! What!!! What's the problem? No sir. We're looking for Meng. Meng, There are your friends. Here we go. Now... where was I? You were telling us about the crazy old woman named Porn. Northeastern folks... got married and settled down corn farm here. Then... she was... ...Her husband had an affair with a hairdresser so he left... ...left her and their son behind. Good... you have arranged the story for me. Okay, the boy's name is Tong. He was a little retard. Somebody told me that... ...when he was young, his father used to beat him up all the time. His mother was no better. When she was beaten... ...he would run and hide at the tunnel. He was almost crushed by the train several times. What's next? So not recently after her husband left. Tong was gone. Just like that... gone!! Most people said he got hit by a train. Until one day, some guy found him on the train to Bangkok. He came back and told us about the boy. They were on the same trip. I was once told her about this She tried to go after him to Bangkok. The villager talked her out of it by saying. Don't go... Just wait here. In case he comes back, he'll find you home... So she waited and waited... until she was cracked. Some of the villager said. She was a ghost. They were mean enough to scare little children. How long was it? Several years. By now, Tong is probably a grown man. Thank you very much grandma for saving my life. Maybe we should find Tong for her... ...so she would feel good and get better. And where can we find him? In Bangkok. Do you have any idea how big is Bangkok? Do you... Moo? If uncle doesn't know, you don't have to ask the rest. Why don't we ask Abdul? - Abdul? - Yes. - Follow me. - I did followed. - Do you know a lady? - Yes. - Do you know a man? - Yes. A lady who is standing on this side. What does she has on her hands, a watch or a bracelet? A watch. A watch!!! Did you see that? How did you know? By the power of the buddha image. You see? If you haven't seen with your own eyes, you probably wouldn't believe it. Not only he can see and predict, but he also cannot be shot and stabbed. He is invincible. Anyone would like to have one for your self... ...gather around. It's just 159 Baht only... ...159 Baht only!!! Music, Tan No, I have a question for Abdul. Cute little girl... like to tease, don't you. Where is her parents? Just let her ask one question. How hard could it be? Yes... let her ask. - Abdul? - Yes. Our audience would like to ask you some question. Can you give her the answer? Is it against the rule of heaven? No... shoot the question. Tong, Porn's son, where is he now? Bangkok. Just tell her, Abdul, which part of Bangkok? Silom, Pratunam, Siam? Silom. Which part of Silom? What? I guess these wonderful children, you all may need the image. Like to have the buddha image. So how many of you? 5 children with only 50 Baht!!! That's alright. If you really want it, we don't want 200 Baht. We don't even want 50 Baht. Wait a second... what??? Abdul said we only need the respect fee... ...19 Baht only. Just this one time and that's it. One and only chance... 19 Baht only. I didn't say I wanted to buy it. Now, we can be a real Five Saturns. The victim is a boxer of Payakphan Camp. His real name is Boonsom Nerntew... ...or known in the name of... Good afternoon, Kasemsook Hotel. 300 for aircon... 120 for no aircon. No need for advance booking. Sir, we're looking for the magician. What kind of room do you want? No, we don't. We're looking for the magician. A magician? Go to the fresh market. This is a hotel for god sake. The magician is staying in hotel. We saw his car parking out front. Adbul only told us the address to the magician... ...but he won't tell us. What are you talking about? I don't get it. Do you think he will page him for us? If he doesn't come out... ...then we'll try again. Do you sleep in here? Of course. Where else would I be sleeping? Here you go. How come you are all quiet today? We have a secret mission to discuss... ...and we don't want you to know. Okay... okay. I can take you to Bangkok to Tong... you know. All I need is a train fare and pocket money for food. Why do we have to go all the way to Bangkok? Can we just call him or send him a mail? Abdul only gave us the rough location of Tong. We need to find out the telephone number, home address at the post office. Nil, we do need to find Tong for Porn. Find Tong?? That's easy. Just take the train overnight and we'll be there at Hua Lampong train station. Then we take the bus to Silom where we will find Tong. Find Tong. Put him on the train... ...for a night and that's it. We're home. Bangkok? I've been there thousands of time. I know Yaowaraj, Pratunam... ...Sanam Luang. I've been to all. I've seen plenty in TV. It's easier to go around Bangkok... ...because there are buses. Hey... in modern day is BTS Sky Train... ...no wonder the theme park is out of business. Just tell me when you make up your mind. Anyone who wants to go, be my guest. I don't think so. If we all go, you have to go too. Why? You just said a minute ago that we don't have to go. How can we leave you alone down here. Big mouth. What are you afraid of? Don't forget we are the Five Saturns and protected by the buddha image. Exchanged for bank notes, please. You forgot your mosquito repellent liquid. What's the rush! What else you need? Forget anything? Now this time at camp... ...don't push your friend in the fire again. I don't want to be called to Principal's office. Yes, mother. I'm selling you at cost. Take it or leave it. I really want this but I don't have enough cash with me. How about this... you give me all you've got. But be careful on your way out. Really... okay... I'll take it. Meng, why it takes so long? Did he buy it? He doesn't have enough money... ...so I told him to come back some other times. If you told me earlier... ...I could prepare stuff for you. Wait for me, I'll take you to school... ...so I can have a word with your teacher. Mom, please don't. They'll tease me don't go... please. Mom... I think it's enough. Hey, those football team. Are they going to Bangkok too? No, they're going to Pitsanulok. On the different train. Hey, that's Moo. Go get him... ...before he humiliates himself. Go. If you don't eat, give it to me. Wait... where're you going? Go away. What? What do you get all so upset about? Now what? Move... ...move. There's plenty of space here. Where is it made? Hongkong. Clothes with minor defects... so they gave me reasonably low price. - What Do you think? - It's nice. Well... I don't want to lie to you... ...but this shirt is taken from the corpse. Don't listen to him. He likes to joke around. King... why do you lie to them for? Dam! It belongs to the rich people. When they're dead, their relatives change clothes for them. Look at this one. It's Calvin Klein. No, thank you. Look, it's CK. You are bastard, she was this close to buy it. How much can you possibly make? Come on, let's clean up. Time's up. Man, if I can just sell my stuff here. Full of rich kids... ...and this drunk. They can't tell the difference. I didn't know... ...you are partners here. Cool stuff you've got here. What a cool stuff. Look's who's talking. I'm just a guy they pay to take care of the place. Unlike you. What are you talking about? How much? I'll take them all. Deal? What? I'm lost. It's just us here. Don't lie to me. Someone tipped me that... ...you got new source. Good stuff too. That's bastard Dang... ...big guy here... he runs this place. So what's your deal with him? I told him, I'll think about it. I didn't know you have this one for sell. Get up!! Get up!!! Why wake her up? I'm not you. Get up!!! Where are we? In Thailand... but don't know which part. Hey, Drop dead!! Or may be not even Thailand. Hey, where's Abdul sleeping? I don't know. Haven't seen him yet. Hey, get up sleepy head. Last night, I dreamt that Abdul took all our money. It's all gone. Hey... ...Get up. June, were you dreaming or did you really see it? I'm not sure. I kind of saw it when I went to the restroom. Why didn't you wake us up? Abdul must have got off at some station by now. Excuse me, Sir. Can you help us? Our money was stolen last night. Where is your teacher who accompanied you? Tell her to get off the next station and file a report with the police. You'd better go now. Are we there yet? I hope you're not giving up. Sacred image, please help us. Why don't we go to the police? We'll be sent home in no time that's why. How about we go back to get some more money and come back? Our parents would know that we lied to them. You can take us to your sister, Sui. Why her? I can't remember the way. You... stupid!! I don't exactly know where she lives. Right... and all these time you were bragging. Now, we're stuck. We can't help Porn. But Abdul said that... ...Tong was somewhere in Silom. How about this... ...we take the bus to Silom... and when we get there... ...we just asked people there for Tong. When we find him... ...tell him about his mother... he can buy tickets home for us too. Please help us. I wish for smooth journey. Where should we start? Just spread around. Ask everyone. There must be someone who knows him. Can we put the bag somewhere first? I can't carry it all around like this. Let's put them all here. No, you can't. We'll lose them. We'd better put them with that lady. Excuse me, can we place our bags with you for a while? Are you Tong? Porn's son? Is your name "Tong"? Say that again? Tong... I said Tong. Over there. Who's Tong? Do you know Tong? Which boy scout camp you belong to? No, I'm not. Uncle, are you Tong? No. Tong, Porn's son. Are you Tong, Porn's son? Are you Tong, Porn's son? Over there. What? I'm hungry. Let's eat the left over canned fish. You go get it. I'll get it. Hey, it's my bag. Don't go, please... that's my bag. What are we suppose to do now? This time, we are in deep... deep trouble. This is good stuff. Whose is it? No, this one belongs to the big mouth representative. He died while he was doing... you know... Didn't you hear the news? No. What did it say? He was too excited to do it with young girl. So he forgot to drink the water after taking Viagra pill. So pill got stuck, he couldn't breath... ...and died. - That terrible? - Yes. I took the clothes off before he was incinerated. Shit. Why it's all news... news... news. Excuse me, we want to go to the temple to have some food. What do we have to do? Just tell the monk. Where you all came from? Pitsanulok. We're looking for Tong. Who? Tong, Porn's son. Did you guys run away from home? No wonder you have no money. So you're hungry... right? Come on, I'll take you. You mean it? Get in!! My name is Tong. But I'm not the one you're looking for. You'll be okay because I have a lot of connections. It's piece of cake. But then again... ...if I spend my time helping you... ...I could be losing a fortune. Look at you... bunch of rascals, aren't you? But you ought to be smart enough to work for me. So you can earn yourself tickets home. You bastard Tong. Are you thinking of using these kids? If you help us find Tong... ...we'll help you. Piece of cake. Back home, I help my dad all the time selling at the store. What kind of job you want us to do? Wait... let's stop by the restroom... you all better dress up. Look at the place. Bunch of rags like you... ...probably be thrown out in no time. Come... come. Who want to go first? But they are left over food!!! Take it or leave it. Who said we're not eating!! The rest!!! Follow me!!! They're all yours. 100 Baht please. Can I take you to the movie after you get off from work? Thanks but no. I'm married. Is it yours? You bet. So everything's all settled? Yes. Are you afraid coming down to Bangkok all by yourselves? No. We are protected by the Five Saturns buddha image. This image? It looks like a carved soap. Watch it for me, will you. I need to make a phone call. How? What if someone wants to buy it? Just sell them. How much for each? It's up to bargaining. It's all up to us? Yes. Excuse me. Before I was so poor. But since I had these two shirts, now just look at me. Richie rich. How about sharing your luck to others? Would 1,000 Baht do? Nope, it's not for sales. What about 800? No. - 700? - No. Where does the offer stands? What? Only 399. That's it? What? This young lady here have something to tell us. This brother here said he had only 300 Baht. But he wants it real bad. Let's me repeat. He wants it real. I... I bad. Would you take it? How about this... 800 or 399 Baht... ...we won't take it. We're asking for 199 Baht. Just only this time. But then again, we won't take 199 Baht. Brothers and sisters, just 79 Baht will do. Just 49 Baht No. Just 29 Baht 19 Baht only. King, want some noodle? No, thanks. Try it, it's good. Please don't tell me we're robbed. They're all sold out. Were you that good? So we must have had a fortune. 1,327 Baht in total. What?!?! There were over 100 shirts. That's all we get? This is worse than being robbed. Excuse me, Sir. Are you being considered as inefficient? Well, let's the result proves for itself. Moo... Moo. I would like to announce that... ...we do have the solid evidence and a lead to the killer. What about the rumor that the killer... ...is someone in the boxing business? Do you have any comment on this? No, we cannot reveal further information at this stage... ...as it will affect the investigation. I just want to request all professional boxers to... Wait for me. ...to be more careful. So does this mean the police do not have potential leads? Nil, Peak, are you in here? Abdul? Colonel Kitti has firmly insisted... ...before the press that... ...if the police cannot arrest the killer within this week... ...he is willing resign. Yes, I insist on my resignation... ...if we cannot find the killer within 7 days. It's a miracle! They are all sold out since 9 o'clock. Tonight is your night then. I have 5 assistants tonight. Who are they? Suburban kids. They came to Bangkok to find a guy named Tong, Porn's son. They got lost and robbed. So Tong took them into his care. Wait a minute... Tong, Porn's son? Why? Do you know him? Well, there is a comedian named Tong. His mother also named Porn. He ran away from home when he was young. I know him quite well. What a coincident!! You don't believe me? How about I take you to him? I need 100 pills of painkiller. Here you are. Remember what I taught you and don't get caught. Trust me. It's piece of cake. It's turning. This is good stuff. I bet tonight's school party is going to be messy. My boss said that... ...if you want to total blast, do it with marihuana. Where is it? Okay. Here, take it. You finished your business. What are you staring at? Is it good? Yes. Can I try? Go!! Just one bite... please Go!! Now!!! Nil. I think we're lost. We'll find it. We should have found Tong by ourselves... ...instead of wasting our time delivering his stuff. I don't think so. It probably takes us forever. It's easier helping him with the delivery. He will in turn help us. It's not necessary. Don't forget we have the Five Saturns buddha image. I already prayed for help... ...we are safe now. Now, we'd better pray that we find the place. Stop babbling. You don't believe me? Last night the image saved my life. What are you talking about? Are you crazy? If you don't believe me, watch this. Hey, what are you doing? June. Wait... June, come back. June, open your eyes. June, come on, open your eyes. June!!! June, watch out!!! June!!! Watch out!!! June!!! Hey!! Nil! Look!! Nil!! I can't believe this, Moo found his way to this noodle shop. Hey, I'm not stupid. Stupid? The shop he delivered was right across this place. He was the first one here as you can see from his work here. Moo, don't you feel anything eating up all Tong's money. So I don't care. We helped him with the deliveries and all. What about Nil and June? I haven't seen them yet. But they knew this is a meeting place. What take them so long? School hasn't ended yet? I bet you must be studying very hard. Which year are you? A year older than you. Good answer. What's your name, honey? What's your mother's name? Good answer too. Hey... hey!! Stop!! Don't you run away!! Who are they after? Are you sure it's this house? Here, Look!!! It says 76, isn't it? Come on in. The door is not locked. Nil, do you think these people will buy Tong's drug? I'm not sure. See you tonight at the pub. I'll set up the time for you to meet Tong, the comedian. I'm not going. Tong will take the kids there. How come? I thought they sold all your shirts. Today you should deserve a rest. Besides, you can hear me sing. That's all right. I will listen to your songs some day... ...and I hope it's not maew maew. What's up? I think we'd better wait for King at his house. What if June and Nil come here? They are lost for sure. June, let's go. Come on, hurry. Moo, hurry up. June and Nil must have got to the noodle shop by now. We should have waited there. It's waste of time coming here. You wanted to eat too. Don't blame it all on me. Can you speed it up! This is irritating. I should not have let you come along. Who said I wanted to come? Ask him! Did I want to come? You're the one who made me come. You're such a big mouth. How could we let you stay back home? But if I know that you're useless, I would have changed my mind. Fine. Then I can go home and rest. Besides I already have my train fare. You started all these troubles and now we're all in deep shit. Moo, shut up. No, let him talk. Just say what's on your mind. Okay, you want hear this? Fine! I'm not the only one who thinks that you cause all this... ...Seng thought so too. What? I say... Nil and June would have the same idea. If it wasn't for you, we'd be home relaxing. Now we're stuck. Moo, that's enough. Seng, is that true? I was just... just only teasing. Fine. You two can go home now. I'll find Nil and June by myself. Your mother taught you that? Are they back yet? Come on in. "What are you doing," boys? How much for... all three of you? For what? "Oh boy, know how to play" hard to get too. For this!!! You are bastard!! Help me... I'm being raped!! Run. Go... ...Run... "...Run... Moo, hurry!!" Now what? Just wait here. "It's quite a clear spot," Nil and June can see us. "Here, Moo's Five Saturn" buddha image. Excuse me... Mister... have you seen little boys? No... no... go away. No. Not again... "Nil, I think we've" come to the right place. "Yeah, let's find them." I'm sorry... wrong room. "No, wait." "King, are they" who you're looking for? King. Where have you been? Come in. Dead. Too late. Just the body with no soul. The police was searching the cloth of the dead person. Oh... his name is Sunthorn. Look he has his home number with him. "Hello, I'm Sunthorn." I'm not home right now. Please leave your message after the tone... ...And that guy goes. "Yes, Sunthorn, you're dead. Anyway, please come to pickup your body at the morgue. Bye." This one. It's bullet proved. Die. Die... These boys are looking for me? Yes. "Are you Tong, Porn's son?" You know my mother? We're in the same neighborhood and... ...we know your mother... I mean we met her. Let me. "Your mother, Porn." What's wrong with her? It's like... she helped June from a train crash... ...so she was hit instead. "She's all right, isn't she?" She's alive? "No, she's not dead yet." Calm down, she's not dead. But she is still unconscious. She kept calling your name. She misses you all the time. They want you to come home with them to visit her. Thank you so much. It's because of me. I shouldn't have run away from home. But I... I hate farming. But I've set my mind that... I would save up some money... ...before heading home... but look at me. At the end of the day... ...I'm just one ungrateful bastard. I miss them all the time. But it looks like... ...I don't love them at all. I don't know whether dad and mom will forgive me if I come home this time. Wait a minute. Didn't your father left you since you were young? Left me? He's still with us. And why would he leave? "Are you Tong, Porn son," who was Lamung residence in Pitsanulok province? I'm from Pitsanulok province but I'm not Lamung residence. Oh! No! We came to the wrong person. "I'm sorry, Tong." I'm so sorry. Then do you have any news about my mother? Your mother is probably fine. Don't worry. It's official confidentiality. I just can't reveal anything. But you don't worry... ...you will definitely see me in the headline news pretty soon. But I can't guarantee that we would caught him dead or alive. How did you escape? This is my police friend. We're working on this case. He's my partner. What case? You're lucky he didn't lock you up for good. I can't believe you're standing here bragging yourself. Wait a second. Where are you going? You are really something. I think we should make a treaty... ...to avoid insulting each other. I'm taking the kids to the apartment. Are you coming with me? "No, I'll take them." You stay here with Maew. I'll take them. I knew this one wasn't who you're looking for... ...because I just found the real one. Are you kidding? I'm not. Can you take us to him? We're there. Let's go. Is he here? I assure you. This is it. This is the last time I ask you for a favor. I promise that I will take you to him tomorrow. "You are lying to us again," aren't you? "No, I'm not." Are you telling the truth? You all know how famous I am. "Please, help me one last time." Don't make me beg. "All right," we all go in together. Me too. Just 4 of us. "June, you stay here." "Hey, I'm one of you too." What a nice friends you got there! You can all go in. But don't forget the sample. "Here, let them try first..." ...Understood? Good... good. "For the best result," you have take marihuana afterward. What kind of recipe? I've never tried before. Do we get all the orders? "Kiat, give them the money." Move! ...Hurry up... Meng! Look at your ugly head. Papa would kill himself... ...seeing you like this. It's always you who gives him headache all these years. You're in big trouble. Go home... now How dare you teaching me? Look at yourself for a change. You... you're asking for trouble... mister. ...All right... all right... I'm not hitting you. Hey... where's you're taking my brother? Why it take him so long? "Wait until I find him, I'll..." Hey... that's Seng. Holy shit!! Have you find Tong? I mean... he got away. You are something. Why did you drag them into this in the first place? I don't get it... why Dang has to buy drugs from you? Because he already owed the dealer 3 payments... ...so he wouldn't dare buying from them. Why didn't you just sell him the real stuff? Because I owed the dealer too. That is why I tricked them with the painkiller. Kiat... what am I going to do with these kids? Let them go... I'll take care of this little lady right here. What are you going to do with me... ball head? Stay still. In my life... I've never kicked little boys... What's the carved soap for? What do they call this... fatty? Dang... watch out! "If you want him alive," drop the knife. Dang... don't worry... They don't know how to use the gun. They would rather care for a friend's life. ...I'm sure they won't do it. It might go off... just like that. "Come on... what's gone," let it be gone. Stop threatening me... look... my hands are shaking again. Let them go. Get out. Go... go... go. Hey... that's police checkpoint... pull over. Tong... lose the gun... hurry... they'll see it. What's all about? Are you two using my brother? That's why you're afraid of the police. Sui... please don't notify the police. Otherwise... I'm telling papa on you and your night life. Meng... it's me who will be telling papa about your little scam here. Sui... please... I'm the one who ask Seng to come along. Meng... you let your friends call you with papa's name? ...Aren't you mad... insulted? Good evening... where have you been? To the movie. It's a very good movie... a lot of shooting scenes. Officer... officer? What's is it... mam? My god... what the? I... I feel like throwing up. Go... go... go. "You know, how did" we find Sui? It's a fluke. No... it's because I made a wish to the buddha image. And tomorrow... we'll find the real Tong. I wished for that too. Please... let it be true. ...Left... yes... Right... left... that's it... o.k. Speak out... Tong Speak out I don't want to go home. And I thought he couldn't talk. Your mother is sick... she kept calling for you... ...and would you be so cruel leaving her all alone? I don't know what's going to with you two... but come home with us. I want to see her so much... but it is not possible. "If she sees me again, it can" worsen her condition. Why is that? I think... she's mistaken me for my flirtatious father. Just tell her you're not him. She won't believe me... I've tried that before. Have you tried to visit her before? No... I haven't... but... But what? How did you know that she doesn't want to see you? Well... Well... I called her once. She screamed at me. Call her? "Yes, I called her." Call her... call her... man... you could have done better. I mean... what kind of lunatic would use the phone. I didn't coach him... he did all the talking. Tell me... who are you? I'm a boxer. This is your money. And we'll take it. Don't you raise your voice? This is not the first time you tricked us. All you've ever though is scamming people... that's sick! What do you expect to do? Do you think Tong is really existed? You can spend your whole life finding him. I can deal the fact that you can't find him... but why lie to us? Come on... It's time to go home. If your parents has ever found out... ...you are grounded for life. Now... move it. I'd better take you to the train station... ...to make sure that you leave town for real. King... King. The police is able to identify the serial killer. His nickname is Tong. I really... really... hate this name. I'd better change my name. Can you shut your mouth for once? Is there any connection with the kids? The police confirmed that... "the serial killer's," known as Tong... ...a psychotic patient who disappeared... ...from the mental hospital last year with the surgical tools. "Mr. Tong is from Lamung," Pitsanulok province... "he left his mother, porn..." ...to Bangkok since he was young... he was sent here for therapy... ...for a year now. "At the moment, police" has teamed up to search the Minburi district... ...where is expected to be a killer's hiding place. It's no use now... the kids have gone home. That's great... Good for us. If they're still here... we'll absolutely be in trouble. King... I saw the news about Tong on TV. You... you don't want to run "into the killer, right?" Yes... we do. Let me take them out... I've been following them from the camp... ...down to Hua Lampong... back to the apartment... ...and now they're moving again. Just follow them... do as I say and keep reporting to me. Even the police couldn't find him... how could we? It's not too late to change your mind. Stop... stop... stop... that guy's looked like the one on TV. Oh... no... just... some resemblance. ...You dumb pig Hello... Dang? They just went into the alley... You'd better finish them now... or just let me do it. It's getting darker... it's harder to remember the way. Do you think we should wait for the police to catch him first? It would be easier. Look... we've been searching for ages. And there's still no sign of him. It's hard to look from inside the car. We'd better walk. King... watch out. Move... Move Move it. What are you smiling at? Where are you? Wait till I catch you? Come on out. Help... Help Please... call the police. Go hide... You want to die? Run... Maew... run Let me handle this. That one is yours. What are you going "to do it, beauty?" Hit it on your head that's what I'm doing. That's scary. So stay here for a while... okay? Open the door. There's huge mouse upstairs. Nil... Nil... open the door for me. Please... call the police... hurry. Help... Help... we're getting killed. Where's June? Still got stuck upstairs. Let's hide here. No... Tong... you'd better run fast. Nil! King. Come here. Come on out. Bitchy... aren't you? Buddha image... please help us. Nothing can help you now. The storm has aggressively moved from the gulf of Thailand. Into... King. Enjoy the violence... aren't you? Love it... Right? I'll show you. "It's him. It's Tong," Porn's son. Don't be afraid. We're the five saturn. Rock a bye baby... on the tree top How could he remember this song? Went the wind blow... the cradle will rock Tong... It's really you. June... don't go near him. Tong. Your mother is sick.
